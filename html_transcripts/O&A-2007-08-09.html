<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a self-deprecating introduction, embracing their reputation as "shock jocks."  The broadcast began with a discussion about a guest who called their show "the worst show I've ever been on," which the hosts gleefully interpreted as high praise.  The conversation then abruptly shifted to their perceived failure to adequately cover a major New York City storm, featuring subway shutdowns, widespread flooding, and a surprisingly intense Brooklyn tornado – the first in over a century. They apologized for their lack of coverage, blaming their early start time and ignorance of the storm’s severity.  This discussion was punctuated by frequent, explicit jokes, vulgar language, and exaggerated descriptions of the tornado’s intensity using the Fujita scale. A caller from Oklahoma contributed to the tornado conversation, contrasting the New York reaction to the event with the more commonplace occurrences in Tornado Alley, further fueling the vulgar and off-color humor.  Bob Kelly was in studio, filling in for Jim Norton.

A significant portion of the show devolved into graphic descriptions of Opie and Kelly's experiences unclogging toilets with their hands, segueing into a discussion about their "perv switches" and inappropriate behavior.  Recurring segments like "Fun Fact Thursday" (featuring the first copyrighted video, "The History of a Sneeze") and a revamped "Perv News Thursday" (with an apology for a previously aired story involving child assault) were also included.

A later segment focused on two main topics: Anthony's bizarre anecdote about finding and wearing a woman's underwear (repeatedly denied and then admitted, eventually explained by a claimed "hot" feeling), leading to jokes about a "panty turban," and a comedic critique of Larry King’s interview with a young skateboarder who had fallen 50 feet at the X Games.  The hosts and Kelly mocked King's out-of-touch questions, playing audio clips highlighting his lack of understanding of skateboarding.  This segment also featured listener-submitted audio for "What the Hell is That?", showcasing disturbing images and descriptions of bodily anomalies, causing Bob Kelly to vomit.  Other recurring segments mentioned included "Perv News" and "Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday" (Opie forgot his sweatpants).  The show briefly touched upon the space shuttle launch, Barry Bonds’ home run record, listener calls, and fun facts.  Anthony also banned several Paltalk users for excessive use of the letter "Z."


A rambling, Larry King-style interview with skateboarder Jake Brown followed, punctuated by non sequiturs and tangents, including discussions of skateboarding tricks, his broken hip, and his memories of interviewing Mama Cass Elliot.  The hosts repeatedly mocked King’s interview style, focusing on his phrase "Boy, that's pretty great stuff." A listener attempted to share a fun fact about the Space Shuttle Endeavour but experienced technical difficulties, leading to a story about Pat Duffy's self-inflicted staple gun injuries, including graphic details.  The show also featured calls from the "Space Shuttle in Denver" guy and a caller with multiple wives, along with discussion of a paintball competition against Adam Carolla’s show and Bob Kelly remaining a guest.  "Perv News" included a story about a naked priest jogging near a high school.  The show concluded with a recounting of a commercial recording session for a computer repair service, followed by a highly profane live read for a hair removal product ("Mujan") with guests Otto and George, and a phonetic rendition of a Spanish-language commercial for Strauss auto parts.  The broadcast also included Gary Goleman's stand-up comedy appearances and a graphic story from Opie's childhood about a shooting accident involving his father and brother in the Mojave Desert, further detailing his difficult relationship with his alcoholic parents.

A conversation with Jonah Hill, promoting *Superbad*, began with Gary Goldman in studio.  A caller shared a darkly humorous anecdote about a childhood incident involving tequila, firearms, and a near-death experience.  Jonah Hill recounted stories about accidentally revealing his father's death to another comedian, an encounter with O.J. Simpson, an awkward meeting with Jerry Seinfeld, and the anxieties of talk show appearances.  The conversation included discussions of a video of an underwater breath-holding attempt, "jackers" (viewers masturbating on camera), a leaked *Superbad* press junket video, and celebrity opinions.  The segment concluded with a commercial for a novelty rock.


The show continued with discussions of *Superbad* and *Hot Rod*, followed by a lengthy showing and discussion of a heated, profanity-laced argument between Lily Tomlin and David O. Russell from the set of *I Heart Huckabees*.  Listener calls and emails followed, including a discussion about "juicy boxes" and comments on the Tomlin/Russell video.  This transitioned into a discussion of Bobby Kelly’s book, including a story about a restroom encounter with Opie that detailed the size of their penises, followed by a song about a little boy playing baseball, which prompted emotional responses from Opie and Kelly.  The show also discussed the tax implications for a fan who caught Barry Bonds' home run ball, the absurdity of *Extreme Makeover: Home Edition*, and the potential downsides of such generous home makeovers in low-income areas.  The final segment included Gary Goldman's upcoming performances, an upcoming Opie and Anthony event in Camden, New Jersey, and a brief anecdote about a failed Spanish-language commercial due to Anthony's lack of fluency. Gary Goldman was a guest in studio.

[00:00:00]  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-CANADA, 877-438-9677.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice. 
[00:00:30]  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Intimous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  If you want to put it, feel free. 
[00:01:00]  I've done it before.  I'll let you go from to my, and that's really sick.  This is where entertainment is going.  More audio of E-Rock in the bathroom.  They are sick freaks.  Can you pop this there?  I want to see something squirt out.  Aim it over there.  This is the worst, this is the worst show I've ever been on. 
[00:01:30]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I love the latest intro.  Why is it cool to have, and it is.  Somebody say, this is the worst show I've ever been on.  And we're like, yeah, cool.  That's a compliment.  Nice.  I like that.  You don't have anyone from the Scott and Todd morning show saying that. 
[00:02:00]  It's the worst show I've ever been on.  Hey, hey, watch what you're saying.  This is our livelihood.  You know, call me stupid, but I think if someone is saying it's the worst show they've ever been on, that's a really good thing.  It is.  It makes me think people want to listen.  I'd rather listen to the worst show on than the best show on.  Yeah, absolutely.  It's always more fun that way.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Lots going on today.  Oh, we got our first fun fact coming in. 
[00:02:30]  What already?  Kevin from Connecticut.  Fun fact Thursday.  Today, New York City has 722 miles of subway track.  Well, we found that out because of the big storms.  The big storms.  I think we got to apologize to our home market of New York City.  Yeah, we really didn't give them much of anything on it.  We were asleep at the wheel.  We start our show yesterday.  Remember, we were looking out the window going, God, I hope the sun comes out. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, oh, it looks a little drizzly out.  It was one of those creepy mornings in New York.  It was raining like sideways, really dark, dark rain clouds.  And the sun finally came up around 9 in the morning.  Yeah.  And we're just doing our show like, yeah, oh, well.  Anyway, Barry Bonds hit another Homer last night and talking about all this crap.  And then we get off the air and realize like the subway system in New York was shut down.  New York's infrastructure fell apart.  Yeah, and we're doing dick jokes. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, that's pretty much it.  And usually we're on top of things.  I don't want people to think we're not going to be on top of things when stuff happens in New York.  We're here for you.  Yeah.  We kind of weren't yesterday.  I'll tell you what happened.  It was a timing issue.  Yeah.  We start the show pretty early.  We get here pretty early to, believe it or not, do show prep.  Yeah.  Believe it or not.  No, hold on, people.  We do.  And we get in pretty early.  When I drove in, it had just started. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  And then there was this just deluge that came down and saturated the city, filled the subways  with water where it pretty much stopped the subway system here in New York.  And we're up here just, you know, looking at the paper.  Hey, like you said, Barry Bonds, all kinds of stuff.  We didn't realize what pandemonium was going on outside.  Oh, there was looting and gunfire and ambulances and police sirens.  It was just all hell was breaking loose.  And we're talking about Barry Bonds hit another home run, everybody. 
[00:04:30]  Until we spoke with Patrick Duffy's girlfriend late in the show.  And she said, oh, well, I got in late because of the storm last night.  Right.  We're like, last night?  What are you?  Oh, you mean this morning?  Right.  And she goes, oh, well, it was like last night this morning.  You know, last night around 4.30 in the morning.  Yeah, because I keep forgetting.  People consider when we come in, it's still nighttime for people.  Oh, yeah.  It's still last night. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, yeah.  So that storm hit, and we considered it yesterday's news or something.  We just didn't even acknowledge it.  So you're right.  I think we owe New York City an apology.  The water was pouring into the subway, so they had to shut down the subways.  It happens, because I saw people on the news like, we need top-grade everything.  There's always someone there to bitch.  It's, you know what, there's going to be stuff that happens that you can't, you know, protect  against.  And yesterday was one of those days.  The subways flooded, unfortunately. 
[00:05:30]  It happens about once a year.  And so then the cab lines, because people have to get to work, were like 200 deep, something  like that.  Yeah.  200 people in line.  200 people in line for the cabs, and then the roads are flooded.  Yeah.  So they closed, like, major roadways.  Yeah.  Major highways here in the New York area.  So it was just a mess, what we call a Cluster F.  And then there's a tornado in Brooklyn, so they're yelling and screaming like crazy over  there.  And then you tune in the Opie and Anthony show, hey, why'd you take that staple gun and put 
[00:06:00]  a staple in your forehead?  We're just idiots, man.  Just want to acknowledge, I think we blew it yesterday.  Yeah, yeah.  We got to admit, we completely missed it.  Look, we like to have fun, and we like to get crazy.  We like to do some of that shock-jockery.  Yeah.  But we also like to show people that we're informed and intelligent.  And have a little fun with things that happen in our area. 
[00:06:30]  But, oh, talk about missing the boat.  A tornado in Brooklyn.  What is that about?  Well, yeah, a tornado.  And we're the worst with timing as far as when we babble.  That just goes to show, half of what we babble into these microphones are just that babble.  We were talking about weather and global warming and everything, and I remember this conversation  came up about natural disasters in the Midwest, tornadoes. 
[00:07:00]  They were talking about how hurricanes were going to be getting closer to our area and wreaking  havoc.  And we were saying, you know something?  We haven't had a big hurricane since, like, Gloria years ago.  And even that didn't do catastrophic damage where it shut down parts of Long Island.  And it just doesn't happen.  And we were talking about, you know, tornadoes.  Now, the Midwest gets tornadoes.  That's something we will never get. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, that's for Tornado Alley.  Yeah, and we just went on and on.  And since we've said that, two tornadoes have hit our area.  Pretty good ones.  And the first tornado ever to hit Brooklyn.  To hit Brooklyn.  Ever.  And you're right.  Our timing is awful because I was talking about, like, manhole covers exploding and  stuff.  And the next day, like, we had that steam pipe explosion.  The steam pipe exploded.  I'm telling you, there's something going on.  There's some kind of, like, some kind of natural force that revolves around you and 
[00:08:00]  I.  God's listening to our show.  There's something going on.  God listens to the Opie and Anthony show.  Are you believing in that global warming thing, yes?  Now that we got the first tornado ever in Brooklyn?  I don't know.  What the hell is that about?  I don't know.  By the way, when they say...  I hate to, like, jump on that bandwagon.  By the way, when they say first tornado ever, I want to see the records from, like, the  dinosaur era.  Yeah.  Brooklyn was there in, you know... 
[00:08:30]  It was called something else.  It was called...  It was called...  I'm thinking it was called, like, Dinosaur Valley or something.  Dinosaur...  You think there were dinosaurs in Brooklyn?  I don't know.  Like, something, but...  Big dinosaurs with Yankee cats on...  But the area we know as Brooklyn today was something else.  So I want to see the records from, like, the dinosaur era.  Yeah, I bet a tornado or two might have swept across.  I'm going to have to go into some caves and see if there's any, like, tornado drawings.  Caves of Brooklyn?  Better stay out of there.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's self-hurt. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah, and Brooklyn Tornado and Opie, they're classifying it as an F2 on the Fujita scale.  An F2.  An F1 is pretty mild.  Now, we broadcast to a lot of people all over the place.  Yeah.  There's a lot of people right now in their trucks and stuff laughing, going, pfft, F2.  I ain't an F2.  Why don't you shut up about your stupid F2?  Let me explain.  F1.  I'm still trying to find pieces in my house.  F1 is pretty mild, you know.  F2, still pretty bad. 
[00:09:30]  You know, that's what hit Brooklyn.  Ripped off rooftops, uprooted trees.  Got through a Nissan dealership.  I think the one I got my Pathfinder from years ago.  Then F3 is starting to get up there.  And then there's F4, which you just don't want to be around.  I remember seeing an F4 once driving through Oklahoma.  Really?  What about, what about, there's only one more.  The F5. 
[00:10:00]  What?  F5?  Yeah, F5.  Finger of God.  Yeah.  Ugh!  That twister moment was brought to you behind the Ovi and Anthony show.  No, that was a good-sized twister.  What was that, an F3?  Solid F2.  See, now you've lost me again.  It's the Fujita scale.  It's the intensity of a tornado by how much it eats. 
[00:10:30]  Eats?  Destroys.  A little encounter man back there is a strong F2, F3, maybe.  Let me see some F4s today.  That'd be sweet.  F4 is good.  F4 will relocate your house fairly efficiently.  Is there an F5?  Trophy is still aware.  What would that be like?  The finger of God.  The finger of God.  Finger of God.  Why don't you put her in charge? 
[00:11:00]  Have you ever seen an F5?  Just one of us.  Just one of us.  Just one of us.  We're going to see another one.  You know, the guy that's a heavy drinker.  Damn.  Hold on.  We're doomed.  We've got to get this out of the way.  Max in Oklahoma.  Max, what's up?  Oh, you had a cute little F2 tornado.  I told you.  I knew this was coming.  Yeah, go ahead.  I blow dry my hair in F2 tornadoes.  Did they close the whole city because of that? 
[00:11:30]  Hey.  It was Brooklyn.  They don't see tornadoes.  Hey, I'm a storm pit chaser.  Yeah, the Brooklyn storm chasers.  Hey.  We chase them in IROC Z's.  Hey, Kaminoosh.  I'm detecting an F2 on the Fujita scale.  Hey, let's go out and get some Fujitas.  With some galamata. 
[00:12:00]  Some galamata.  I was eating my galamata.  And I see a tornado coming.  I'm like, Jesus Christ.  F5.  Forget about it.  Burden Philly in F2 is the finger of Rich Voss.  It's nothing.  Nothing.  There's nothing going on with the F2.  I'm sitting there in Brooklyn.  This f***ing tornado comes screaming through my neighborhood.  I'm like, you know, hey, I don't mind the tornado as long as the f***ing f***ing f***ing 
[00:12:30]  stay out of the neighborhood, huh?  We don't need that.  You know, this tornado does enough damage.  We don't need the f***ing f***ing f***ing f***ing coming in here.  I heard something that sounded like a, what'd you call a freight train or something.  Came right down the street.  I'm trying to eat my galamata.  America!  My galamata. 
[00:13:00]  I thought a bunch of f***ing f***s were coming over from the Bronx or something.  I reckon a joint.  And then the roof comes off my house.  Hey!  Let's go storm chasing!  Hey!  Extreme, man!  Hey!  Yeah!  Come on, get in!  Get Maria!  Get Maria!  Because if she's f***ing hanging around here when a f*** tornado comes through, I don't  want to hear about it.  And I gotta get my car out of the way because if this f***ing thing gets scratched, I'm gonna 
[00:13:30]  be pissed.  Hey, Kaminoosh.  Get you the Yankee tickets?  Are they safe?  I will go to the game tonight.  What the hell is that music?  Oh, this is from Twister.  Come on.  This was the big, uh, the big cat in Twister.  Van Halen's human being.  Yeah.  You got any Sinatra?  I like chasing tornadoes to Sinatra.  It scares the c***s away. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  Here's the official story on the tornado in Brooklyn.  It was a freak tornado Wednesday morning, wreaking havoc on homes and cars in Brooklyn  and trashing streets for blocks.  At this Bay Ridge car dealership on 66th Street and 5th Avenue, in a matter of minutes, the  rooftop and awning were ripped off and trees yanked out by the roots. 
[00:14:30]  The worst of the storm brought winds of 135 miles an hour amid a furious thunderstorm and  three and a half inches of rain just after 6.30 in the morning.  This is the first tornado believed to have hit New York in more than a century.  See, just after 6.30 in the morning.  Oops.  What were we doing at 6.30 in the morning?  We let Brooklyn down yesterday.  Sorry, Brooklyn.  Sorry, Brooklyn.  Tornado's howling through.  Howling through and we're giving our bonds commentary. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, we suck sometimes.  Brooklyn Roof in Dice Voice.  I'm over here now.  Tornado in Brooklyn, it must have caused like $68.50 in damage.  That's not nice.  Yeah.  That's not nice.  All right, let's go to Illinois and say hi to Ryan.  Ryan, what's up?  I got a fun fact for Fun Fact Thursday.  All right.  Okay, do you guys know what the first recorded video or the first copyrighted video was? 
[00:15:30]  First copyrighted video?  Yes.  Ah, no.  The History of a Sneeze.  The History of a Sneeze?  By Thomas Edison.  Oh.  Wow, that's a...  Oh, Thomas Edison.  That's a wonderful fun fact for Fun Fact Thursday.  That's a fact.  I don't know how fun it is.  All right, thank you, sir.  Yeah, now, you know, it gets worse because I thought we were talking about bonds yesterday 
[00:16:00]  as this tornado is hitting Brooklyn for the first time.  Yeah.  We could have done some great stuff on that yesterday.  Well, I'm being informed that yesterday we were asking why sumo wrestlers don't play goalie in the NHL.  Meanwhile, roofs are blowing off of buildings in Brooklyn and cars are being toppled.  And we're wondering if it's legal for fat guys to play goalie in the NHL.  Oh, my God.  Ah, that's why... 
[00:16:30]  We got the...  In Brooklyn, we used the hair gel scale.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, you get a tornado to f***ing...  If your hair don't move, it's an F1.  Because, you know, you got your gel.  If you get a few hairs out of place, it's a f***ing F2.  And a f***ing F3, your hair's going to move around a little bit.  But you stick it out your window and get that aerodynamic hairdo done.  And then the F4, your hair's blowing around pretty good.  You could look like a f***ing...  What about the F5? 
[00:17:00]  What?  F5, mingy, forget about it.  Why?  What happens?  What happens with the F5?  F5?  Yeah.  It's the finger of Sinatra.  Hey, let's go tornado chasing, huh?  With Frank playing.  Oh, this is extreme.  We're cruising down Fifth Avenue. 
[00:17:30]  Look at that.  Good, I hope it blows every f***ing f*** out of this neighborhood.  It's wrecking the joint.  That's all right.  You could...  No, no, no.  Take the iRod.  Take Marie.  Where's Marie?  Marie!  Marie, get in the f***ing car, Marie!  Can I interrupt you?  Stupid f***.  Can't you have a better song to storm chase with?  This is a little mellow.  If you can't storm chase...  You need some, like, Van Halen.  No, no, you gotta storm chase to Sinatra.  How about Metallica?  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da. 
[00:18:00]  You need something.  It's the chairman of the board, ass.  All right?  You gotta storm chase to this.  Lean back in your seat.  Look.  There's a tornado.  It's ripping some roofs off.  It's carrying some f*** and f*** away.  And then the dirty f***, and a few of the f***ing f***, and those goddamn f*** that  run all the f*** stores.  It's not even a curse, but it'll let on to what I'm, you know, getting at. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, I'm melting away.  You see a tornado?  I don't need a...  No.  Let's go get some...  Let's go to the restaurant.  Screw this.  All right.  We're pretty bad tornado chases here in Brooklyn.  Hey, uh...  We only have one to chase in a hundred f***ing years.  Get that head.  Whatever.  Uh, henchman.  Henchman from Brooklyn is suggesting maybe Summer Winds by Frank Sinatra.  Oh, Mingy.  That's a good one, huh?  And it makes a little more sense.  Hey, Kaminoosh. 
[00:19:00]  Kaminoosh.  Put it on.  Put it on.  Summer Wind.  And, uh, as we get that record...  He's blowing in across the f***ing sea or something.  The Lingard Egg.  F***ing big hair.  Come along with me.  Ah, booby man writes, Staten Island is about to fall into the ocean.  Why don't you talk more about your hotel in Detroit?  You guys are a bunch of asses.  I know, Willard.  Here's Summer Wind for a little more Brooklyn storm chasing there.  Yeah. 
[00:19:30]  There we go.  Now, this is nice.  This fits a little better.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, the summer wind is blowing in.  The summer wind came blowing in.  Oh, blew some roofs off the house.  Yeah, huh?  So this is playing inside your IROC.  Oh, yeah.  What's going on outside your IROC?  Well, we're storm chasing.  Yeah.  We're storm chasing.  Hold on.  Hold on. 
[00:20:00]  I got to take care of something.  What are you doing in our neighborhood?  Get out of here.  It's Italian's here, you.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  The tornado blew him in.  Hey, what can I tell you?  The tornado blew him in.  The tornado also might have blown him against that fire hydrant and given him a head injury.  Get out of here.  The tornado's blowing off some people in the neighborhood.  The whole bunch of you.  Don't look at my sister, you.  Hey. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, huh?  Not their fault.  Yeah, but I love everyone.  I listen to hip-hop.  I'm tired from all this storm chasing.  All right.  I'm going to go down to a Mario's and get some...  I lost my house to the summer wind.  Kevin from Connecticut.  I lost you.  All right. 
[00:21:00]  Steven S. from Bayshore.  Oh, the summer wind.  I heard that 17 pinky rings were lost in that tornado.  The autumn wind.  All right.  We're just getting started.  So we want to acknowledge that we might have blown it yesterday.  Yeah.  We should have.  We should have probably been on the ball since it was like right in our backyard here.  You don't want to miss the first thing ever, ever.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  If you're broadcasting and the first thing ever is happening, you should acknowledge that 
[00:21:30]  on your radio show.  We stink.  Oh, man, do we.  All right.  We got phone call Thursday.  Oh, boy.  Perv News Thursday.  That I like.  As long as it's fun.  Yeah.  We reworked Perv News Thursday because that's something else we blew on the show a couple  weeks ago.  Well, we were feeling it out.  Perv News has to have some kind of a kind of wacky twist to it.  Yeah.  That makes it like, oh, okay. 
[00:22:00]  When no one's really getting hurt.  Yeah.  It's just a pervy story.  You know what a good Perv News was?  The guy on the subway that the woman took a picture of with her cell phone and they found  who he was.  Yeah.  And wouldn't leave him alone.  Yeah.  He was there kind of doing things with himself.  Yeah.  On the subway.  That was fun.  Barbecue tools being used on.  A little kid in the alley.  Not so much fun.  That wasn't fun.  See, we at least acknowledge it when we F up.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:22:30]  One more twister clip.  You got that one for us, E-Rock?  This is for Brooklyn today.  And, of course, it's also Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday.  Extreme!  I forgot my sweats again.  Someone's got to remind me!  You got to send him an email the night before because he can't do a good male camel toe without  his sweats.  He gets one on each side of his sweats go down to his knees.  It's wonderful.  It looks like Brooklyn after a tornado.  It's a mess down there. 
[00:23:00]  All right.  Give me another twister clip there, E-Rock.  Maybe we should get off of this road.  You may be right.  Joe!  Bill, are you all right?  Jesse, you guys set up?  Joe, we're set.  We're going in?  We're going in.  You ready?  I'm on it.  Be careful.  We've got to get Dorothy on the street. 
[00:23:30]  Dorothy.  Speaking of how many loose ends were in that movie, why not just leave it in the truck?  Leave the truck there.  Let's acknowledge the New York Post with their fine, fine front page today.  Twister, first tornado in 118 years.  It's Brooklyn.  And then they have a picture of Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz saying, this ain't Kansas.  No.  118 years ago, there was a tornado in Brooklyn?  They're saying this was the...  Some are saying first ever.  Some are saying the first in 118 years. 
[00:24:00]  Sweeping people off of Coney Island in their stupid bathing suits.  And those striped ones with the muscle men and their big handlebar mustaches.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Lifting the weights with those big black balls on the end.  They're throwing that huge, huge medicine ball back and forth to each other.  Getting changed in striped cabanas on the beach.  The stupid women are going swimming in some kind of dress thing.  It's a dress with their hats on.  Because we were scared to see women's skin.  Yes.  It was very scary back then to see women's skin at the beach.  So they had to wear dresses at the beach. 
[00:24:30]  They had to wear floppy hats.  It's 100 degrees out.  Yeah.  Look, it's a tornado.  Yeah.  The older days.  We might have to do the 40s music.  Even before that.  I don't even know.  We know like flapper music.  Yeah.  The Charleston.  All right.  We're just getting started.  Oh, hey.  You're dropping stuff with tornado in the studio.  Oh, my God.  You must have said F5 again because something fell.  Fingery God.  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:25:00]  All right.  Good morning.  It's ONA.  Our phone number, 877-212-ON-A for the Opie and Anthony show, of course.  Let's go to James in New Hampshire.  James.  Hey, James.  What's up?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, James.  How are you today?  Hey.  Oh, I'm lovely.  Thank you.  Good.  I just wanted to point out a fun fact.  118 years, tornadoes hit Brooklyn with more frequency than the Red Sox win the World Series.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, no. 
[00:25:30]  You didn't do that.  Look at that.  Oh, boy.  Oh.  It doesn't really work anymore since they, you know, won.  True.  And they have a World Series victory.  It was a mere couple of years ago.  My team hasn't won in 20, 21 years.  Yeah, the Mets.  Wow.  86 for me.  21 years.  Seems like yesterday.  Yankees, how many years for you guys?  Come on.  Oh, my God.  What?  Nine?  Six?  When was it?  Ninety?  What? 
[00:26:00]  You got a mic?  When was the last one?  Ninety?  I just didn't want to talk for some reason.  Ninety-nine or two-thousand?  I feel like I was an intern.  I was giving sign letters.  It was two-thousand?  Yeah, two-thousand.  Two-thousand?  So you're-  It was two-thousand.  Ninety-nine?  All right.  So you're pushing eight years now, too.  Eight years!  Didn't it seem like the Yankees were winning it every other year?  They haven't won one in eight years.  Yeah.  Last time they lost, it was really bad.  Wow.  I always have to say, wow.  Oh, boy.  Was that a doozy. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Was that uncomfortable.  Hey, Bob Kelly in studio for Jim Norton.  Jim's on the left coast taking a couple days off.  Yeah.  A little vacation thing.  So we got Bob Kelly in here because he did such a great job with What the Hell Is That  for Us.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  What a great job you did, man.  That was the last time we saw you.  Just puking all over the place.  That's not happening again today, is it?  Nah, nah.  I think we're going to just do some regular radio with you today.  You're not going to- 
[00:27:00]  You deserved it.  Oh, good.  You ought to do that just for the ab workout because the sound you make sounds like every  muscle in your body is just tightening up.  Here's Bob.  You ever puke so bad, though, you really think you just did a nice ab workout in the end?  Sometimes it feels like you've been shot in the stomach.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just one of those, oh, my God, I can't breathe.  Every muscle tightens up. 
[00:27:30]  It's horrible.  But I puked so bad last time my lip went numb.  My bottom lip was numb because I was puking so long that I didn't breathe.  So I was on the verge of passing out in the bucket.  Hey, Bob Kelly said something just before he came back on live, and it reminded me of what  happened last night.  I don't know if this has ever happened to you.  I know, definitely.  I don't even have to look at him.  What I'm about to say, you're going to be grossed out, and you're going to say, absolutely, 
[00:28:00]  I've never done this.  No doubt in my mind.  But Mr. Kelly over here, I think we might have something in common.  Possibly.  I'm not really sure.  Yesterday.  A lot of ways.  Six and a half inches for you, too.  Exactly.  Yesterday at night, my girlfriend caught me with my arm all the way up to the elbow inside  the toilet. 
[00:28:30]  All right.  All right, stop.  I think there needs to be more nouns and verbs.  Wait a minute.  It was a bit embarrassing.  That is disgusting.  Oh, I'll get right in there.  No, you won't.  Kenny picks me up this morning, and I go, oh, Kenny, I got a clogged toilet.  Oh, God, yeah.  Did it clog because of some kind of malfunction in the building, or did you clog it? 
[00:29:00]  I clogged it.  All right.  It must have been a, how many feet of toilet paper did you need?  Yeah, it was quite a few sheets.  And Kenny goes, you've got to use a plunger.  I'm like, I got a plunger.  But for some reason, when you plunge, it doesn't pop back to plunger mode.  It stays like folded or like bent.  Those are for pressure down plungers, not suction up.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You put it in there, and then you push down real hard.  And then I work? 
[00:29:30]  It forces it back down the drain instead of sucking it up.  I tried different types of plungers.  I tried it a few times.  It didn't work.  So then I'm like.  Just to be in the business.  Well, you're a janitor?  Yeah, yeah.  And then I'm looking around.  I'm like, ah, she's watching TV.  What the hell, man?  You know, I don't really care.  So I start digging.  Oh, my.  And I'm pulling paper off it, off the clog.  But I have to get really deep in there, and I'm pulling. 
[00:30:00]  Dude, are you?  Why?  I don't even get.  Like, the hand.  I wanted it on clog.  It's the last resort.  You know, I've had that happen.  I was in last resort mode.  I didn't feel like calling a plumber.  No, plumber.  Basic household items.  MacGyver the toilet.  All right.  You got to MacGyver it.  I've had that happen.  All right.  All right.  All right.  You're on to something.  Because that's what I was thinking, too.  The plunger's not working.  I'm like, I need something.  I couldn't find anything in my house to kind of snake. 
[00:30:30]  I need a little snake to poke through.  You have no wire hangers.  That's all I would need, right?  Wire hanger.  You unroll it.  You know, you undo it so it's straight.  Why didn't I call you last night?  You put a little hook at the end.  And then you snake it in there and wind.  Why didn't I call you last night?  Because that's what I was thinking.  I'm like, maybe there's a spoon or something I don't need anymore.  I'm looking around.  I'm like, I can't find anything.  So then the next best thing, I'm like, well, this kind of looks like a  snake.  You know what else I've done?  This is a timed event.  So this one is a timed event, but it works. 
[00:31:00]  Take a newspaper.  Yeah.  Roll it up until it's about the size of the hole in the drain in the  toilet.  Okay.  Then you shove that down in there.  Okay.  Wait a couple of seconds until it expands.  Okay.  And then rip it out.  All right.  And that'll clear the drain.  But you can't leave it too long because the water will start soaking up the  newspaper and you'll end up with toilet water on your hand.  But if you let it expand a little bit and then just yank it out of the hole, you 
[00:31:30]  create a vacuum and it pulls everything out.  I went for the, I went for the flush last night before this whole thing went down and  watched the water raise.  Yeah.  We've all been there like, oh God, please stop.  Please stop.  Please.  Right to the tippy top.  I'm like, and it stopped.  I'm like, oh God.  Here's another one.  You got an empty two liter soda, a soda bottle.  Yeah.  Upside down, put it into the hole and squeeze it.  And it squeezes the air, forces the air down the toilet and clears it out. 
[00:32:00]  Dude, the hand is the last resort.  I went last resort because I didn't have.  You went last resort first.  Because I didn't have any MacGyver crap.  That's first resort.  I didn't have a MacGyver thing.  You got a MacGyver that toilet bowl.  I'm going to go.  I hope we saw a baby hand and we tried to rescue it.  I'm going to go with the, I'm going to try the hanger.  Yeah.  I'm going to go hanger.  The hanger will work for you.  That's pretty good.  But the reason I brought this up, because Kelly sits down and he goes, I had a little  issue with my shower and my toilet and everything yesterday. 
[00:32:30]  Well, that storm yesterday around six o'clock, all of a sudden you see a blub, blub, blub,  blub, blub.  And it's freaking me out.  And I go into the bathroom and the toilet is just bubbling over.  That's not good.  Like Ghostbusters.  Like evil is around.  Evil is escaping.  It probably is.  It's in your apartment.  Evil.  And then I look in the shower and it just starts bubbling out of the shower.  Oh, that's not good.  At least the toilet, that's where that stuff goes.  But if stuff's bubbling out your shower. 
[00:33:00]  But I'm looking, I'm like, is this bad?  Is this bad water?  Is this okay water?  Well, it wasn't.  Water that comes out of the drain, always bad.  Well, I saw, when I knew it was bad, I saw actually pine needles.  And I'm in Manhattan, there's no pine tree.  I actually saw an Indian nickel actually pop up.  Know why pine needles?  Someone in your building is a health nut.  Is a health nut.  They're eating some crap. 
[00:33:30]  Either that or that.  Two guys having sex by a tree in the park.  Shaking them loose.  They're absorbing into the ground.  The only thing that aggravates me, though, is anytime something crisis like this happens,  and it's six in the morning, and my girl kind of wakes up, but she's looking at me like,  okay, go be the man now.  Fix it.  Be the man.  Be the man.  And I'm sitting there.  I'm like, I need a screwdriver, because I put a valve in where you shut all the water  off in my apartment.  Oh, you got like the emergency shut everything off valve.  The plumber, I said, put a thing in here, because other than that, I have to go to the super 
[00:34:00]  and have them shut the whole building down.  So I have this little thing, but it's behind a box, and you need a screwdriver or the key  that comes with it.  It kind of defeats the purpose of having it there.  Everything will leak pretty quickly while you're trying to find a key.  Well, you can do it with a screwdriver.  It means just those little thin locks.  And I go to her.  Everything's coming out of everywhere.  And I'm like, go get the key.  What key?  Get me a screwdriver.  What?  And she's just staring. 
[00:34:30]  She's panicking.  I mean, she's just not trying to panic.  She panics, and she stares at me.  He goes, my father never talked to me like that.  I know, because you wouldn't be this stupid right now if he did.  You'd go get the damn key.  Go get it.  You should have got a nice whack across the cheek.  I got crap water and leaves and little alligators flying up my arm.  You ever have the overflow where you flush the toilet and it starts coming up on you? 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  And you don't know what to do?  You jump under and turn that little oval valve under the toilet, and it's a race against time.  Again, you're like turning.  The water's coming up.  Come on, come on.  How many times does this thing turn around?  You know what I do?  And then it stops.  I just put the lid down and make believe it's not happening.  Hold for the minute.  This isn't happening, man.  You use the Wile E. Coyote.  Pull the shade down when the train is coming at you.  That's what I said.  A little gag.  That actually just prevents big chunks from actually coming out.  Yeah.  It's like a filter.  It kind of comes out of the bottom between the seat and the bowl. 
[00:35:30]  Did I tell you about the toilet in my old place in the basement?  Oh, yeah.  Basement toilets are notorious for overflowing.  Well, old building, and the landlord didn't feel like fixing anything.  So, one day we're smelling stuff.  Let's just put it that way.  Smelling stuff.  And we go downstairs, and the toilet is doing pretty much what you were saying.  Like, it's all coming up out of this toilet, right?  This is what's beyond gross. 
[00:36:00]  It's bad enough when you know it's your stuff.  It was the building's stuff.  And it just kept coming and coming out of the toilet, onto the floor.  Ugh.  You hear that?  You don't need to.  And we got one of these emergency plumbers.  What are they?  The 24-hour plumber dudes.  Yeah, they charge a lot.  A Russian guy, and, man.  They always have nice attitudes.  Russian guy, he's not shy at all, man.  I mean, you're making fun of me because I did what I did last night.  And honestly, you know, I left out details to make it a little grosser for the radio. 
[00:36:30]  Just tearing down one of the radio walls for everybody, all right?  The reality was the water wasn't that bad, okay?  Let's just put it that way.  And Opie's so rich that he uses spring water in his place.  Yes, it's Perrier.  It's Perrier water.  But this guy went in, no gloves, doing the exact same thing.  And it's the whole building's waste coming out of this toilet all over the place.  And then he just unscrews the whole toilet and lifts it up off the ground because he really has to get in there and dig. 
[00:37:00]  And now it's just a swamp of you-know-what in this bathroom.  And this guy's not even phased.  You need a new wax seal, my friend.  Right, right, right, right.  I was, back in my country, I was nuclear physicist.  Now I hear in America, they fix the toilet.  This guy is-  I was big in the KGB.  Very, very important man in my country, the Soviet Union.  Now I put a fist into a crap hole in floor. 
[00:37:30]  That's my job here in the States.  But the Soviet Union was so much better than America.  You people don't know how to live.  I was important man.  Worked at rocket factory to make bombs to kill you.  Now I clean out your toilets.  Wonderful, proud Soviet people.  Every one of them's got a story about how great their job was. 
[00:38:00]  There wasn't one person farming or raking over there.  Everybody.  I was one who put the charges around uranium to blow your cities to crap.  Now I have same stuff in my hand.  Oh, this guy laughs at crap.  This guy laughs at crap.  I laugh at your crap.  Dude, it looked like a crime scene.  He's in the middle.  He doesn't even have like, like, like, he doesn't have rain slickers on or not. 
[00:38:30]  He's just going in there, man.  Man, my brother used to goof on a guy.  We called him Stinky Levine.  Yeah.  Because he would just, he wouldn't use tools.  Yeah.  He would dig his hand in, have a big spackle bucket next to the toilet, and whatever he got  a fistful of, he would just throw it into the bucket until the water went down.  It's like, oh, this guy, why did, there were tools for that.  I had to do that on a Greyhound bus.  I dropped an expensive pair of sunglasses in the toilet. 
[00:39:00]  Don't care.  I squint.  Squint, idiot.  They were my friends.  Not anymore.  Yeah.  Well, I actually, it took me 45 minutes to muster up the courage to stick my hand in that  blue mist.  I stuck it in, and as soon as it went down, just, it was almost like things just retracted  to my hand.  Oh, yeah.  Thank God buses carry such, you know, upper crusty clientele.  They don't carry the dregs of society.  They're eating cheese sandwiches and vodka. 
[00:39:30]  It is fun fact Thursday.  Human waste is magnetic.  Is it?  Yeah, it'll come back at you.  Oh, yeah.  It's magnetic.  You ever, uh, well, let's just put it this way.  Yeah.  This person will remain nameless, but this person thought it was a good idea to relieve himself  in the ocean.  Wait, wait, wait.  You're not, you're not talking a basic easy relief. 
[00:40:00]  No, no, no.  Oh, no.  And he thought he could get away with it.  No.  And this thing, this thing attacked us like jaws.  This thing would not.  No way.  You want to talk about magnetic properties.  This thing, we couldn't swim fast enough, and this thing was following up.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know if it was the current or what, but this idiot.  When we saw the first one, about daybreak, start cruising. 
[00:40:30]  Right.  And, yes, I called you an idiot.  This idiot decided this would be a good idea.  He went off on his own while we're all just kind of like, you know.  He dropped the, he came in like a submarine and shot a torpedo and just took off.  Oh, yeah.  We're just boogie boarding and just like frolicking, a bunch of us, you know.  And he thought it would be a good idea to swim a little over there and do his thing, and  And no one would know.  And this, this, yeah, yeah. 
[00:41:00]  You go in the cage.  Cage goes in the water.  It's in the water.  Our.  Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish lady.  Yeah.  Yeah, I am calling you an idiot today.  Wake up, Trish.  Wake up.  It actually body surfs in, right behind you.  This was not a boating accident.  This is.  All right.  We got to take a break. 
[00:41:30]  Bob Kelly's here.  A lot of people asking about Pat Duffy.  Well.  Well.  Sad to report, but.  Pat Duffy.  Yeah.  Pat.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The return of what the hell is that to the Opie and Anthony show was an overnight success.  My God.  This is awesome.  Who could forget the sounds of cysts being ruptured and Bob Kelly vomiting into a bucket. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, Bob.  He's.  Bob.  He's puking.  Well, we're going down that pus-filled road again, kids.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  If you have a bump, boil, bruise, legion, pustule, cyst, inflammation, or otherwise unidentifiable oddity on your person,  then you're perfect for what the hell is that.  See?  That's why the show's called What the Hell Is That?  Email Travis at foundrymusic.com with your ailment or freakish growth and your contact information,  and we'll have our crack team of medical professionals take a gander at it. 
[00:42:30]  Bring it all to the back.  And most likely giggle at it.  It's the return of the return of What the Hell Is That?  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  I can't explain how gross it is.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-CANADA, 877-438-9677.  Yo, check it out.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's a good one so far. 
[00:43:00]  It's a good one.  Morning.  Lots of things going on today.  We've got Bob Kelly in the studio.  And, Bob, it's Phone Call Thursday.  Uh-oh.  Sounds exciting.  Yeah, doesn't it?  Yeah, it does.  Anthony hates Phone Call Thursday.  Because it just, it's a day for people to call for the sake of calling.  Yeah.  So it's nothing.  It amounts to nothing.  It's not nothing anymore.  It's actually Phone Call Thursday.  It used to be nothing.  It used to just be Thursday.  It's brilliant in its simplicity. 
[00:43:30]  Trust me.  It's brilliant in its simplicity.  I've been doing this radio thing for a long time.  This one's a brilliant one.  Happy Phone Call Thursday.  This is brilliant.  What are you doing?  I called.  Do you got anything?  No.  See, this is why it's so brilliant.  I have to finally explain it to people.  Well, everyone lowers their expectations when you hear it's Phone Call Thursday.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Ah.  It's like when you see somebody who's not quite right in the head.  Yeah.  Maybe a little handicapped.  Yeah.  And they're doing a menial job, but they're doing it well. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  And you're like, wow.  That's impressive.  Because the expectation is so low.  I told you that the best service I ever got in a Burger King once was from a girl with  Down syndrome.  So, she got my order so fast, and everything was perfectly in the bag.  Nothing was spilt over.  Yeah.  Nothing missing.  Try the million customers before you that got, you know, a shake mixed up on the fries. 
[00:44:30]  No.  You know what?  I threw the food away because I wouldn't eat it.  God knows where.  She's been sticking her hands all day.  A little un-  See?  They're like scratching.  Anthony, I remember when you told a story back in the day, and you showed a heart that  day.  You were very impressed by this.  I was praising.  Yes.  There's nothing wrong with showing that you have a heart every once in a while.  It was a girl with Down syndrome, and she did a great job.  Her tongue touched the bag.  And it was-  No, it did not.  Did she steal a fry?  No.  She did not, and she was very courteous and cordial. 
[00:45:00]  She said, thank you.  No, she didn't.  She went, thank you.  Well, whatever.  I knew what she meant.  And then I left.  I was like, wow, that is the best, fastest, most efficient service I've ever gotten at  a Burger King in my life.  That's cool.  Now let's see you do algebra.  Yeah.  How much do I owe?  Granted, like there was a shoe in the bag, too.  No.  Hey, hey, hey.  I don't even know where it came from.  Keep it nice, because I remember the original story.  You were touched by this moment.  I wasn't touched. 
[00:45:30]  You were touched.  Look, I was impressed.  She was doing a better job than-  You had the start of a little tear in your eye.  Are you insane?  A tear?  I just want people to know out there that you do have a heart at times.  That's great.  I tell them to keep the change.  You're coming for me, I know.  Well, I'm skeeved out by people.  You know that.  Yeah.  Like goopy stuff and spit and snot.  And I just know that for some reason, like sometimes I see a lot of mentally challenged  people wiping their nose. 
[00:46:00]  Their hands are all over their nose a lot.  And that bothers me.  So I don't like, you know-  That's how they count.  Don't shake my hand.  And they give me change, and I'm just like, keep it.  Excuse me.  Look at that.  It's phone call Thursday.  Look how many phones are ringing, Bob.  Is this brilliant or what?  Is this brilliant?  It's not like that on Wednesday, is it?  No.  What about Friday?  No.  Monday?  No.  I hope no one's trying to get through from the top of a bridge, ready to jump.  And they're just getting a busy signal because it's phone call Thursday. 
[00:46:30]  We get the suicide exclusive.  Yeah.  That we're dreaming of.  Talk them down.  But instead we have just people calling.  And by the way, they have nothing.  No, watch.  Of course not.  Watch, they have nothing.  I'll go to Vancouver.  It's Bruce.  Bruce in Vancouver, what's up?  Uh, just Canada's checking in for a phone call Thursday.  There you go.  All right.  That's great.  There you go.  Look, Boston, same thing.  Jen in Boston.  Jen?  Hello.  Just calling for the sake of calling.  Phone call Thursday. 
[00:47:00]  I have absolutely nothing.  Phone call Thursday.  It's, it's, it's, see, look.  It's the dumbest.  I loved it.  It's brilliant.  She just called for the sake of calling.  It's a waste.  Everyone just lowers their expectations.  They don't change the dial.  They just know this is what it's going to be today.  Watch.  Rob in Virginia.  Go ahead.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Anthony, how's it going?  Good, Rob.  What do you got for the show today?  Uh, nothing.  Hi, Bob.  Hi.  Hi, buddy.  See, there you go.  Let's say hi to Lisa in the Bronx. 
[00:47:30]  We could just do this all morning and it would be interesting to people.  But please, let's not.  Lisa, what's up?  Hi, boys.  Hey.  Happy phone call Thursday.  Thank you, Lisa.  I love you.  And then they try to add things like that in to spice it up.  Is that what I'm getting?  A little bit.  We got Buck in West Virginia.  Oh, Buck's got to have something.  Go ahead, Buck.  Well, what's up, boys?  Hey.  What's going on?  Hey.  Yo, just checking in for West Virginia.  Beautiful West Virginia, as a matter of fact. 
[00:48:00]  And why are you calling today there, Buck?  Man, just because it just pisses Anthony off.  I just don't understand this.  I don't get it.  It's brilliant, man.  The phones are lit ever since 6.  Look at that.  But they're lit with nothing.  They're lit with people saying, I'm calling.  Look, look.  That's not for the sake of calling.  Look, we're all big fans of PalTalk.  Even PalTalk.  PalTalk.  It's Tilt.  What's up, Tilt?  Hey.  Happy phone call Thursday, guys.  Thank you, Tilt.  Doing anything today? 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, I'm working.  There you go.  See, you tripped him up.  I'm working.  Oh, no.  Because he has nothing.  He's just calling because it's a day where people call.  Oh, is that stupid?  So it's phone call Thursday.  I love it.  That's in full effect.  It's fun fact Thursday.  We've had a few fun facts.  It's also perv news Thursday, which we have readjusted, and we're going to try again.  Revamped to not include, now, dead child free.  Dude, because we found that perv news Thursday is not that fun when it involves children that 
[00:49:00]  have been hurt very badly or killed.  With barbecue tools.  Yeah.  Let me explain what happened, Bob.  We have all these themes.  Some of them, yes, are ridiculous and stupid, and others we're actually getting some material  out of.  And one of them is perv news Thursday.  We get those silly, pervy news stories, right, that just are in the paper every day, and  we collect them, and then we do one segment.  Well, two Thursdays.  Amazon's bestseller list.  Yeah.  Two Thursdays ago, we were a little lazy, and we see, like, mom fights off attacker with 
[00:49:30]  barbecue tools, and we're like, oh, perfect for perv news.  But we didn't listen ahead of time, and we're in the middle of perv news, and it's silly  music, and it's all fun.  And then we just play this just horrific, horrific story of this poor child being assaulted  in an alleyway, and the mother, or a friend came out, and then the mother came out with  a barbecue tool and stabbed the guy.  But, you know, it involved child assault and everything, and we're like, this isn't fun. 
[00:50:00]  And Ed and I were getting that flop sweat, like, oh my God, oh my God, people are going  to think we think this is hilarious, and we're just sweating really bad.  I'll give you a perfect example.  And we both have Beavis and Butthead faces just like, uh, uh, uh, uh.  A perfect example of a perv news that's fun is, like, when those dentists lose their minds  and just start, like, unbuttoning a woman's shirt in the dental chair because they can't 
[00:50:30]  take it.  Right.  All their professionalism, schooling, every thought they have in their head flies out  the window because a hot chick is laying there.  They're professional for, like, the beginning, going, okay, you're going to, might feel a  little pressure here as I do this.  I'm going to put, give you a little of the nitrous, uh, to put you under.  And, okay, open the mouth.  Let me see.  That's great.  I gotta touch those d***s!  Oh, God!  Oh, God, do I have to put my d***s between those d***s? 
[00:51:00]  Just, it snaps like a switch goes off.  That's fun perv news.  Yeah, and it's called the perv switch, which we all have, but most of us know how to control  the perv switch.  You can deal with it.  You ever see a girl walking down the street and you have to turn around, not even the quick  look.  You have to turn around and look until she's out of sight, until she walks around a corner.  You're just mesmerized by our body or face, whatever it is.  You get these, uh, these thoughts in your head and you're like, oh my God, I can't believe 
[00:51:30]  I'm thinking this.  Undress with your eyes kind of thing.  But you keep it under control.  You keep it under control.  There's the perv switch that people, it's like a breaker that too much voltage went in.  It snapped.  And people give up lucrative careers that they've spent their lives attaining.  Like a dopey dentist will go to school, set up a practice, work for years, get his house,  his cars, his family, everything like that, and then throw it all away because as that  girl is laying in the chair and he's got her mouth open and he's, he's picking with that 
[00:52:00]  little tool and she's asleep, he's, he just loses his mind and goes, I got to take our  pants down.  I want to see her.  I got to, that's nothing to do with dentistry, but I want to see that.  And he's been a dentist for 20 years, hasn't done anything.  No.  But just one day that perv switch goes off.  What a clean life.  And that's it.  It's over, John.  Snap.  All right, so we'll get into some perv news.  We got some good stuff.  We got a guy that had sex.  Like that perv switch. 
[00:52:30]  Perv switch.  We all have it, but some are set at a better level than others.  Have you ever used your perv switch?  Everyone has, but I mean, like you use it in a legal way.  That's what we're getting at.  I had my, I guess the most perv, perv switch experience I've ever had was I was doing a  job in a house, an air conditioning job, of course, used to do that.  And I'm in a house and everyone's gone.  I don't know why, but it was unsupervised. 
[00:53:00]  I think the man was there, the husband, father, and he had left to do something.  Can I stop you for a second?  Yeah.  This happened many, many, many, many years ago.  Oh, yeah.  All right, good.  Oh, my God.  Because I know where he's going.  Dude, it's like 20 years ago.  I know Anthony like the back of my head.  I just want to keep him safe.  How many menies was that?  I'm looking.  Hopefully enough to save him from 20 to, you know.  No, no, I didn't do that.  Well, no, that was some other thing.  I won't even talk about that. 
[00:53:30]  Wait a minute.  No, this one just involved.  I was looking around and there were pictures on the walls and stuff, and I noticed this  guy had the hottest daughter in college.  Right.  She's a college-age girl, and I go into her room, and there are panties on the floor.  Oh, you're getting creepy.  There are panties on the floor.  Okay.  I didn't do anything sick in the panties.  I didn't do things to the panties, but I had to pick them up.  And put them on.  Wait a minute, though.  You didn't do anything sick at all.  So you're in her room. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  And she's not there.  It's her room.  I'm in there.  Her picture is like, I know what she looks like, and she's hot.  Okay.  He just put them on.  But you didn't do anything sick so far, but go ahead.  Shut up.  No, no, so far you haven't done anything sick.  No, it's nothing sick.  I'm supposed to work in there.  You have a hammer and a little belt on, and you're in a little girl's room.  It's not a little girl's, it's a college girl.  All right, go ahead.  But you didn't do anything sick.  Go ahead.  I had to pick up the panties and put them on.  And put them on.  Turn my mic on.  What?  Turn my mic on.  I picked up the panties. 
[00:54:30]  You put her panties on?  You put her panties on?  Oh, my God.  Why would you do that?  I put the panties on.  Why would you do that?  Turn my microphone on.  Did they fit?  This is so unfair.  Did they fit?  This is so unfair.  That's kind of creepy.  No.  You put her panties on.  I didn't put them on.  Opie, can you believe this?  Holy Jesus, Palomino.  I didn't put them on.  Your mic's back on.  What?  All right, tell us this story.  Okay, I picked it.  It's not on.  You're lying to me.  Why would you put the panties on?  Where's my mic?  It's on. 
[00:55:00]  Look.  Hello?  Say it's on.  All right, tell the story.  Why is it my hand?  I swear to God it's on.  Okay, let me turn that off.  Yeah, your mic's on.  Okay, good.  All right, so you saw the panties laying there.  What happened?  I saw the panties laying there.  And I had to put them on.  That is so gross.  That is so gross.  Can you believe he said that?  Opie.  I can't believe he said that.  You think you know somebody, don't you?  I took the panties on.  You put them on?  Did you put them on backwards or frontwards?  Don't even start.  I did not put panties on.  You put the megaphone down. 
[00:55:30]  I did not.  I'll put your mic back on.  Relax.  Hello.  Okay.  All right, your mic's on.  All right, so.  Let me preface this by saying no matter what, I did not put the panties on.  What happened?  I did not put the panties on.  You what?  You what?  I did not put panties on.  Go on.  God.  Leave it on.  You jackasses.  I can't believe you, man.  I really can't.  That's sick, dude.  You are sick.  You won't touch dirty stuff, but then you'll go into a room and do that.  God.  It's not even your house.  It's not your daughter. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, okay.  I put the panties on and the bra, and I marched around the house singing Tra La La.  Make a promo.  All right.  You guys suck.  All right.  What happened now?  Make a promo.  And make a promo.  Okay.  Yeah.  We'll be hearing that one.  All right.  Go ahead.  I had to just.  See, now it's going to seem very innocent, because there's nothing.  Well, Moe from Brooklyn, he writes, I thought I heard Anthony saying that he used her panties  as a coffee filter.  No.  That is effed up. 
[00:56:30]  Look, no.  There wasn't anything involved.  I didn't do anything to them.  I picked them up and looked inside them to see if there was any, like, marks.  Okay.  Because it was on the dirty laundry pile.  So, John, you are an ass man.  I looked, because there was something about that that was kind of, like, hot, knowing that  you're in her room, and I knew what she looked like. 
[00:57:00]  Okay.  See the picture?  Terrific.  And those were her dirty panties, so I had to look into them.  Okay.  Terrific.  If you saw the panties laying there, you would look in them.  No, not, oh, dear Lord.  That's when I fell off the ladder.  Because you had them wrapped around your head.  I did not.  I was wearing a turban, a panty turban.  Imagine the father walks in and just beats the living crap out of me.  While you're wearing the panties.  I wasn't wearing them.  You made his daughter's panties into asbestos mask. 
[00:57:30]  I have to go to the attic, and I forgot my mask.  Oh, what a good excuse.  You're good, Bob.  Oh, that's good.  All right.  So, wonderful.  That's a terrific story.  So, we got Perv News on the way.  Fun fact Thursday.  And then, of course.  I think I made Perv News.  And then, of course, it's Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday.  But Opie forgot his sweatpants again.  I'm pissed off, Bob.  I really, really forgot my sweatpants.  He can't do it.  It's like a motocross guy getting to the track in his street clothes. 
[00:58:00]  You know, you got to be in your racing suit, your gear, your leathers.  Opie comes in for Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday without his uniform.  Yeah.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  The sweatpants make it where he can pull them up pretty much to his neck.  Oh, my God.  And it is the most Extreme Male Camel Toe you're ever going to see.  So, I forgot my sweats.  One of these Thursdays, I'll remember.  And people remind me, too, at the end of the show, don't forget your sweats tomorrow.  And I still forget. 
[00:58:30]  I'm getting all excited for this.  It's hilarious.  I want to do it.  Do you have sweats on today?  No, I don't have sweats.  You always wear sweats.  You could fit in jeans again.  Congratulations.  I addressed two things.  No, they weren't a size 14.  And no, they weren't underoos.  Bastards.  Bastards.  Sorry.  Sorry.  I heard that one.  Sorry.  There's a couple things going on here.  I mean, but can I just say why that was so funny?  He was actually sincere.  Yeah.  That was like, oh, my God, dude, good for you.  And get back into jeans.  I haven't seen you.  That's Opie thinking he gave you a compliment. 
[00:59:00]  That's Opie, delusional Opie thinking he actually complimented you.  I haven't seen you in jeans and, God, I don't even know.  Very good, Bobby.  You aren't quite a slob.  It's like, you are better than last time I saw you.  By the way, we got an official promo now for Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday.  Maybe.  Sounds good.  I really think we've got to get new machines in here.  Why don't we have a new machine there?  I'm really starting to think.  First, you hike your pants up. 
[00:59:30]  Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday.  Extreme.  Extreme Male Camel Toe Thursday.  Everything sounds cooler if you add extreme to it.  Extreme.  Extreme.  Extreme.  That sure sounds extreme.  It sure does, huh?  Extremely stupid.  Hey, after the break.  Sounds like a deodorant commercial.  After the break, we got to play some audio of Larry King talking to that skater that fell 50 feet.  Oh, that must be a great conversation between two people that have a lot in common. 
[01:00:00]  You want to talk about out of touch.  Oh, my God, man.  Larry King should just stick to people that are old people.  Yeah.  Just get old people.  Old Vegas performers.  Yeah.  We'll get into it.  It's funny.  Really funny.  Bobby was here for What the Hell is That?  Bobby.  And because of you and your reaction, that's going to be your bit, by the way, now.  Every time we do this What the Hell is That?  You're going to have to come in.  Yeah.  I'm actually peeping up blood.  I don't know if it's going to work like that. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know if I'm going to make it through a couple episodes.  We farmed out the fine audio from What the Hell is That?  to some of our regulars, and they came up with some funny stuff.  This is Coke Logic.  Listen to this.  Somebody needs to help him.  What the hell is that?  See?  That's why the show's called What the Hell is That?  It is coming.  Is it leaking pus right now?  No one knows what it is.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  I can't look.  Holy crap.  It's going to make you puke.  Bob Kelly's vomiting.  Bob Kelly's vomiting.  Bobby's vomiting.  Bobby's puking.  What the hell is that?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  Coming soon to a theater or radio or something.  What the hell is that?  What the hell is that? 
[01:01:30]  That's creepy.  Isn't that great?  Isn't that good?  That's fantastic.  They did a great job with that.  That's Coke Logic.  We love Coke Logic.  I want to see that.  I want to see that movie when it comes out.  No kidding.  And then someone is saying, get an intern to run out and get Opie some sweatpants.  No.  I got these sweatpants.  What do you think?  Lindsay does wear any sweatpants?  Lindsay gets mad because I wear these sweatpants to the gym.  She's like, why are you wearing those to the gym?  Oh, no. 
[01:02:00]  You wear these sweatpants to the gym that you do?  They're just gray, thick sweatpants.  Is there any poking out, any deformation of the pants when you're working out?  I look pretty impressive in front when I wear these sweatpants for whatever reason.  You don't want to do that at the gym?  I don't give a...  Are they white?  Dude, in the end, I don't give a crap.  I ride a bike and I don't wear the Lance Armstrong uniform.  I go to the gym and I don't wear what anyone else would wear to the gym.  It's just whatever I got laying around on. 
[01:02:30]  Something sexy.  Something sexy.  She might have to call in and talk about these sweats because they're bad, man.  Awful.  All right.  And then RPI.  Are they the green ones?  Green ones.  What color are they?  No, they're gray.  Oh, they're gray?  Like the gray ones you would wear back in the day in high school or whatever.  Whatever.  Just thick.  Just all-purpose sweats with the drawstring.  Nice.  But for some reason, the front of them...  All right.  Like you're in Cirque du Soleil? 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  He's swinging from a scarf by his teeth.  Okay, ball chain.  Step one, two, three, four.  Come on, fussy.  So stop suggesting that the interns go out and get sweatpants.  I got the sweatpants.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's the only sweatpants I'll do Extreme Male Camel Toe in.  Just going to have to wait.  So next Thursday, hopefully.  And then RPI had the audio as well from What the Hell is That?  And he came up with this.  This is RPI.  What the hell is that?  Goodness gracious. 
[01:03:30]  I'm sorry.  You say they could be.  I'm not arguing.  Which is worse?  What is that?  That would squirt across the room, I bet.  God, this is awesome!  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen...  Jesus Christ.  Holy crap.  Oh.  Oh my God.  I can't look.  What is that?  This is the worst show I've ever done. 
[01:04:00]  That was actually uplifting.  Yeah, no kidding.  Uplifting.  That was fun.  That's a feel-good one.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Oh yeah, Larry King after the break.  Yes, definitely.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  The virus is spreading. 
[01:04:30]  What the F?  No!  What's wrong, Eric?  Why are you crying, Eric?  I was having some bathroom problems.  Oh!  Shut up.  Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And Robert Kelly.  Are you promoting anything today?  Yeah, I'm going to be at the Mohegan Sun Friday and Saturday night.  The 10th and 11th.  This Friday and Saturday night. 
[01:05:00]  And I'm also doing my Comedy Central half hour.  Go to my MySpace to get tickets because I want to fill it up with O&A fans.  Hey, that's cool.  Are you guys going to come?  Well, I know Anthony's not coming.  I go.  No, you don't go.  Are you going to go?  Yeah, when is it?  The only way you go is if there's poker chips backstage.  It's on the 28th.  August 28th.  I'm filming it right over at the...  Oops.  Ah, vacation.  Swear to God, yeah.  I won't be around.  I believe you.  Opie comes to my shows.  Anthony doesn't.  I don't live in the city. 
[01:05:30]  I live in the suburbs.  It's hard for me to get back into the city.  I'll let you know when I'm doing a barbecue on Long Island then.  It's Robert Kelly live.  Won't be long.  Why couldn't you get Robert?  That's a good one.  Why couldn't you get Robert Kelly?  Because R. Kelly.  You lost out to R. Kelly?  Yeah.  Well, I mean, he did...  You know, he's a platinum selling artist.  I sold maybe 4,000 CDs.  All right.  Good point.  Good point.  Good point.  He's sitting next to Voss going, CDs, DVDs. 
[01:06:00]  I have CDs.  Robert Kelly live.  All right.  A couple other things really fast.  The space shuttle went up.  Yeah.  I guess when we started, like, flying airplanes, it was a big thing, too.  Oh, what do you mean?  Like, Wright Brothers airplanes?  Yeah.  Or when they kind of got it down?  But back in the day, Wright Brothers, you know, they fly the first plane, right?  Yeah.  And everyone's like, wow.  They all have a city.  Powered flight.  And then the next plane went up, and they went, wow, that's cool. 
[01:06:30]  And the third time, oh, my God, this is still cool.  Now it's just flying.  That's it.  Now you look up in the sky, you can see planes any given moment in the sky.  That's what's happened with this space shuttle crap.  Yeah.  Who cares at this point?  People aren't really interested.  But they have to have the launches live on TV.  I think the reason they continue to have the launches live on TV is because, yeah, news  is hoping for another, you know, another catastrophe.  Well, the news are awful vultures.  So, yeah, anything that happens bad, they love it. 
[01:07:00]  So, yeah, they probably are hoping for a disaster.  It's kind of depressing.  I was telling you as we were prepping for this fine radio show, when you see, like, the  launch go up and you see that big, huge fuel tank, it's depressing to me.  It's like, oh, man, technology really hasn't done crap when it comes to this thing in the  last 20-some-odd years.  They're still using that big gas tank.  It's pretty much just the, we need a big gas tank on this thing.  Massive, huge fuel tank.  We did that 20-some-odd years ago.  We should have had this little small, there should be this small, like, reactor or something. 
[01:07:30]  Fantastic floor.  Or anti-grav unit.  All right, turn on the anti-grav.  Magnets.  And then you're just like, yeah, magnets.  Magnets.  I want magnets.  Magnet technology.  Something besides just loading it up with explosive liquid.  Yeah.  And shoving it out a nozzle and lighting it.  It's pretty much a bottle rocket.  I was depressed, and I'll tell you why.  Because, you know, our lives are flying by our eyes.  Flying by. 
[01:08:00]  You want to see some stuff before you go.  And the space shuttle launch, you realize, wow, nothing there has changed in 20-some-odd years.  Our stupid cars barely have changed in the last 20-some-odd years.  They look a little cooler, but same principle.  They look a little smoother, and there's some gadgetry in it, of course.  Yeah.  But there's no flying cars or none of that crap yet.  And my life is flying by here.  Give me something.  You ain't going to get nothing.  Just give me something.  I want floating buildings or something.  I want jets and stuff.  That's not even on the menu. 
[01:08:30]  Floating buildings would be pretty cool.  I want some kind of jets and thing.  Cloud City.  Of course.  Yes.  I want underground civilizations.  I want floating cities.  I want something.  Something from the future.  It's kind of some old crap.  I look around Manhattan.  They're still building, but now the buildings are all made of glass.  That's it.  Yeah.  A lot more windows.  Big effing deal.  I want floating cities.  More neon lights and TV screens over the subway entrances.  I want hotels under the water where you have to take a submarine to. 
[01:09:00]  They have that.  Here and there.  Oh, but they're little crappy things.  We're talking like take Four Seasons Hotel and submerge it.  Yeah.  That's what I'm talking.  Not some geodesic dome with some stinky hippies in there saying,  Isn't this wonderful?  We're underwater, man.  Give me some technology.  My light's flying by here.  Stop it.  Help us out.  Jet packs.  Give me something.  You want a jet pack?  Getting nothing.  Yes.  I want my own little plane. 
[01:09:30]  Do you want a laser?  Even though I don't know how to fly.  I want to see planes all over the place.  People trying to fly in from Long Island.  It's got to be futuristic.  They got to fold up in a briefcase like the Jetsons.  Yes.  I want something.  So I see the space shuttle thing and I'm getting depressed.  I'm like nothing's happening with the technology.  But they've been building a space station up there for years.  Robot baseball.  Let's go.  Where's robot baseball?  Where's robot mining?  My time on this earth is flying by. 
[01:10:00]  Give me the robot baseball.  Give me the sumo wrestlers in front of the goalie net.  That's just a call back from yesterday.  But yeah, the shuttle went up.  The Endeavor.  And there's a teacher on board.  And she was Krista McAuliffe's like backup teacher 20 years ago.  And she's finally going up on her first flight.  Because they had to make her an astronaut because they ended the civilian space.  You know, civilians going into space.  A little shaky there.  Unless you get 20 grand and you're in Russia. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  More than that.  It's like a million.  Well, when you blow up a civilian, you know.  Ah, people tend to go, eesh.  Ah, maybe we should stop that program for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah, so they.  With kids watching all over America.  I remember that.  Yeah.  And there goes the challenger.  Krista McAuliffe on board.  A teacher.  Here are students watching.  And then the students' faces are just like, oh, oh my God.  Oh my God. 
[01:11:00]  I remember watching it in class and being like, you know, this is great because we don't have  to do schoolwork.  Yeah, we're all.  What grade were you in?  I was in third.  I forget.  I was in third grade.  You weren't in third grade.  I was.  No, you weren't.  I was.  No, you weren't.  I was.  You're singing your sentences again.  Listen.  But actually, when it went off, it was almost just like fireworks.  Like the grand finale.  Yeah.  You know what sucks about it?  It was like so nothing you could do about it final. 
[01:11:30]  Like you just watched it and went boom.  And then you go, all right.  Well, maybe if they, but maybe they did.  No.  Maybe they ejected.  It's just done.  How long did it take for you to turn off the TV and go, oh, that was interesting.  No, I think I was pretty much glued to it.  You know, you talk about the future, though, and the way nothing's happened.  At certain job sites I was at, if I got bored, I would just kind of doodle on some  of the beams up in the attic. 
[01:12:00]  And I remember when that happened, that shuttle, it was 86, I think, right?  Yeah.  I wrote, from 1986 to 2006, hey, how's the future going?  Thinking if someone went up there, it would be kind of cool if they saw that.  Like, whoa, what the guy I found in the attic?  Some little blast from the past.  And I realized nothing happened.  I could look at that and say, look, we got cool computers.  Look at your stupid TV at home.  So we figured out a way to make it flat and throw it on a wall. 
[01:12:30]  Who cares?  Big flat TV and computers.  I want floating TVs.  Floating TVs.  You want everything to float.  I want everything floating.  And I want that, like, what I see with your iPhone where you're just kind of, like,  sweeping.  I want to change channels by just sweeping the air, like some kind of ninja move, like  whoosh.  Like you're moving things around.  The Tom Cruise movie.  Yeah.  What was that called?  That Tom Cruise movie.  That movie.  It was called that Tom Cruise movie.  Ah, Risky Business.  No.  Where he was moving computerized things around. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, it was Risky Business.  So you want a floating car.  Minority Report.  Thank you, Juggernaut.  Yeah.  You want a floating car.  You want a floating computer.  I want something different.  I don't want to be wearing shoes anymore.  Well, they have cars right now that actually.  What?  I want something different on my feet.  How about that?  Just something different.  Like we've been doing.  You've been putting your shoes on and tying them forever.  Figure it out.  Give me something else.  They were doing that.  They were doing that in, like, the 1700s. 
[01:13:30]  Even before that, I know.  But picture somebody in the 1700s lacing up their shoes and tying it.  It's 2007.  Lace up your shoes and tie it.  What the hell?  Right.  See, that's what I'm getting at.  Nothing's changing, really.  Where are the Back to the Future shoes?  You slide your feet in and they go, just kind of tighten up around you.  No pump.  No stupid velcro.  Even cell phones we've had for a while now.  All right, what's next?  What's next?  The iPhone.  It's not the iPhone.  It's some kind of...  No buttons.  ...implant. 
[01:14:00]  You want something in your head?  I want some phone implant thing.  In your head so you just think a number?  Yeah.  And then you'll call home and all of a sudden it just starts ringing, dinging in my ear.  It's hooked up to your eardrum or something and your vocal cords and your brain.  Right.  And you know who's calling and your eye so you can kind of see and you can scroll.  Like people...  You know how people talk to themselves with the Bluetooth and stuff?  Now you'll just see people like blinking, winking, and talking to themselves.  Holding nothing. 
[01:14:30]  That'd be great.  Just give me something.  You know, the life thing is flying by at this point.  Come on, let's go.  Need the future.  Also, Barry Barnes hit another homer last night and man, Anthony really set me straight on this whole thing.  Yes, I did.  I was watching TV last night and they were talking about the, you know, the home run ball.  One of our hometown guys here in New York.  A Mets fan.  A Mets fan who is in San Francisco.  Decided to catch the game and he's the one that caught the record-breaking... 
[01:15:00]  Man, we're getting more details on this.  Barry Barnes ball.  The guy caught the ball.  There's a great picture in the paper today where all these hopefuls...  Oh, just animals all holding their gloves and...  I'm sure it's in your paper.  I'm sure this picture is everywhere at this point.  The post here in New York.  Look, the headline says, I've won Lotto.  And it's a picture of the ball, the actual ball in the stands before it was caught.  Just before it's caught.  Or just bouncing around, maybe.  Who knows?  And you got everybody in this picture thinking they're going to be a millionaire. 
[01:15:30]  They're going to be the ones catching the ball.  Look at all these people's faces.  Look at their faces.  They're just like...  They're screaming.  They also...  Look at the guy with the glove that is so off.  Yeah.  His glove is sitting...  It's down like he's catching a line drive.  And it's over his head.  And it's over his head.  And that guy stinks.  And if you didn't know any better, if you looked at this picture, you would think this  is a picture from running of the bulls.  Yeah.  Or people running out of a burning building.  Yep.  Or people running from a tornado. 
[01:16:00]  I mean, the looks on their faces.  Because they know how important this ball is.  Yeah, they're all focused on it.  And the guy that caught the ball is not even in this shot.  All these people lose.  Because it never goes.  It always bounces 95 times.  No, it hits something and went sideways.  Right.  There's just some dude eating popcorn.  It falls in his popcorn.  Thanks.  That one took a bad hop.  Now, our paper is saying that the ball could be worth up to a million dollars, right?  Yeah.  And on TV last night, I heard they got some experts on, memorabilia experts, and they're  saying $300,000 to $500,000. 
[01:16:30]  Yep.  And last night, I was thinking, wow, that's all?  It seems like it should be worth a lot more.  You know that the Mark McGuire ball, what, fetched the $3 million, I believe?  Yeah.  $3 million, and now that ball's worth nothing.  It's worth a couple hundred thousand?  Yeah.  You know, because that record has since been...  Little lights blinking.  What the F was that?  The lights blinked.  It's the future coming.  Anyway.  The Opie.  Anyway.  The building's floating.  And so I'm sitting there like, why is this ball only going to be worth $300,000 to $500,000?  It seems like this should be a few million. 
[01:17:00]  It beat Hank Aaron's record.  And Anthony explained it to me.  Uh-huh.  But the ball that's going to be really important is the last home run that he has.  The last one.  Right.  So right now, someone's got ball number 757.  That ball's worth a bloody fortune if it's the last homer he has.  But when he hits another one, then the value of that ball is going to drastically drop.  Let's say Barry Bonds, he's going to the game, gets into a wreck, God forbid, and dies.  Right.  The guy that caught the ball, that broke the record, he doesn't make as much money as the 
[01:17:30]  guy that got the ball last night.  Right.  Because that's the record ball.  That's the one.  That's the one.  That's going to be...  I mean, everyone remembers 714, Babe Ruth.  Yep.  Everyone remembers Hank Aaron, 755.  Yeah.  Whatever Barry Bonds ends up with, that is the one.  That's like Babe Ruth's 714th.  Yeah.  That's the one you want.  How much is 713 worth?  713?  Nah.  Who knows?  Yeah, exactly. 
[01:18:00]  Good point.  But it's that last one.  The one that Bonds hits and then retires, has an injury, whatever causes him to stop hitting  home runs, that's going to be the ball that's worth a lot of money.  Yeah, but that's going to be...  But nobody's going to care, because that's going to be in a couple years, probably.  Maybe.  You never know.  Like I said, you never know what could happen.  He's got one more year tops.  He's going to go high.  Are you kidding me?  September's going to be an ugly month for Barry Bonds.  If he is taking those steroids, you know what that does to you. 
[01:18:30]  Get the old pudding head disease.  He's already in his 40s, though.  Got to wear that bandana on your head like Lyle Alzado did just to hold your brain matter in  your ears.  Lyle Alzado.  Lyle Alzado.  I'd just go play ball with it.  It would just piss everybody off.  I'd just go play ball, throw it around.  Play catch with your dog.  Yeah, throw your dog at the park.  Just big slop marks all over it.  Throw it in a pond.  Get it all soggy.  Yeah, some guy from ESPN is crying on the lawn. 
[01:19:00]  What did you do?  All right, so that's a good point you made there, Anthony.  Yeah, the last one.  See, so there's still a chance for you people to strike it rich.  Larry King had a great interview last night with Jake Brown, the skater.  Who fell 50 feet.  Have you seen this video yet?  Unbelievable.  Amazing, right?  Unbelievable.  Great video.  His shoes, both of them.  It's hilarious.  Shot off his feet.  Didn't fall off.  They shot off.  When he hit the ramp.  I thought it was his feet that just flew off his body.  He realized he was coming down like his front first, and he somehow figured to spin around 
[01:19:30]  and hit on his heels, and then his ass, and then his shoulders, and then the back of his  head, which knocked him right out.  But from hitting on his feet first, his shoes rocketed off his feet.  Hysterical.  Amazing.  I lost my glasses and my shoes.  By the way, the X Games...  Skateboarding.  The X Games understand the future and making things better.  Yeah.  They are just inventing things year after year for this X Games. 
[01:20:00]  No jetpack competition, though.  It's on the way.  Extreme Camelton?  It's on the way.  They're doing extreme skateboarding, obviously.  Yeah.  Did you see the size of that ramp?  Yeah, they really did step it up a notch.  Oh, is that amazing?  I wouldn't even go...  I wouldn't walk up that.  Did you watch that clip with the commentary that was going on during it?  The two guys?  They called it, and he was doing a great job right up until he launched himself and came  flying back down.  Yeah.  But they are so excited.  They're like, oh, and he makes it!  Because he did that spin, and he hits the ramp. 
[01:20:30]  And then when he's up in the air flailing, you hear him going,  like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, and he hits the ground and just, oh, oh.  They knew when he was going up that he was just going in the...  He's supposed to turn, not go straight up in the air.  They knew this was going to be bad.  And he came away from the wall, so you're not going to hit that slope and slide down,  because sometimes you see them, they slide on their knees, or they still just slide down.  He just hit flat wood from 50 feet up. 
[01:21:00]  Just unbelievable.  But to see his feet pedal, like he's...  Oh, I know.  I think it was 12 times, just one, two.  People love pedaling.  Because you, if you're in that position, you're going to, like, say, I know we're not supposed  to fly, but hell, I'm going to give it a shot.  Flap your arms.  You're not going to fly with your feet.  You're going to give it a shot, no matter what you've read all over the years.  That's so true.  Your natural instinct is not to let this happen.  Right.  Maybe I'll get some kind of movement if I pedal.  It's like, wait a minute, I'm trying this. 
[01:21:30]  I don't give a crap what the books say.  Maybe I'll be the first person.  Wouldn't it be funny if he just took off across the crowd?  Wow, this is amazing.  What a stunt.  It's going to be hard to beat that one.  Superman.  That's all we needed to do is just try.  No one ever gave it a shot?  Nobody ever gave it a shot.  They just fell.  Pedal when you're falling.  Because we're told you can't fly.  This one guy just went, I'm going to go, and he's just whipping across the crowd.  Amazing.  And then Opie would actually get his future right there.  Oh, my God.  I'm seeing this again and again, man. 
[01:22:00]  They just keep posting this video up on all the video sites.  All right, so Larry King interviewed this guy.  You want to talk about a generation gap.  What could he possibly?  More of a gap than the X Games ramp thing.  I thought you were going filthy on that one.  Hey, they're already calling it the funniest interview ever.  Why are they calling it the funniest interview ever?  We thought we were on to something.  Somebody just posted it on YouTube and all the captions saying this is probably the funniest thing that you're ever going to hear. 
[01:22:30]  I think they're going the same angle that we're doing.  Larry King.  Maybe they're fans of our show because we've picked up on this Larry King, generation gap, clueless, out of touch.  The Motley Crue.  Thing years ago.  When he introed Motley Crue and interviewed him first and then introed him for their comeback and called him The Motley Crue.  The Motley.  You got to get those.  Tommy Lee.  Come here.  Let me ask you.  Tommy.  Let me. 
[01:23:00]  Like he even knows who these guys are.  Like he isn't completely disgusted by their appearance.  His shoulders are the most.  I've never.  Slumped over with his big peanut head.  He has a head that's shaped like a peanut with gray hair on top.  He's just visually like one of the most disturbing people.  He's just hunched over his head and then his show.  The actual suspenders are like in his shoulders.  Like, you know, when a tree grows around a sign on the side of the road, that's what his shoulders have done with his suspenders. 
[01:23:30]  All right.  Here it is.  Nicky's not depressed, is he?  You're not the other down, are you, Nick?  You're up.  Hey, Larry, you got to come out and see one of these shows.  Yeah, I got it.  You start in January.  How long are you going to be in L.A.?  No, no, no.  February.  You and Tommy are going on tour in January.  We headed up.  Yeah.  Yeah, like Larry King is going to actually go to a Motley Crue show.  Bring me some whores backstage. 
[01:24:00]  Hey, I'm going to ask the roadies.  I'm going to point to some whores in the front row.  Bring them back.  You can get my leftovers.  Ladies and gentlemen, here they come at the Palladium in Los Angeles.  They're back together, their first live get-together in five years.  Get-together.  The Motley Crue are back.  The Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue and their little tea party get-together thing. 
[01:24:30]  The Supremes.  Yeah, yeah, it's got to be the.  Because back in the day, everything had the.  The Drifters.  The Doors.  The Doors.  It was always the.  The Motley Crue.  That's why he said the.  The Nirvana.  What an ass.  Oh, that's great.  The White Strafe.  Oh, wait.  That's real.  Oh, wait a minute.  Yeah, I'm going to be touring with them.  Ha ha.  All right, let me.  Did I tell you the time I saw Ozzy snort ants? 
[01:25:00]  It was great.  It was great.  I went hunting with Nugent.  Me and Frank Sinatra tag team Malloran one night.  The Frank Sinatra.  Let's go to Andy in England.  Andy.  Hey, man.  Andy.  What's up, Andy?  Not much.  Love you guys.  Love the show.  Thanks.  How do you listen over there in England?  I listen on Peltalk.  Oh.  Very cool. 
[01:25:30]  How about that?  Peltalk.  And you mentioned me earlier on Juggernaut.  Oh, Juggernaut.  It's keeping me pretty.  I just thought I'd go for a trifecta.  One, I'm calling from England.  Far away.  Two, I've got a fun fact, which is kind of perv news as well.  Far away fun fact perv news on Phone Call Thursday.  Wow.  Let's go, Andy.  Okay.  Fetishes.  The number one world fetish is apparently footwear. 
[01:26:00]  People get really turned on by shoes.  64% of people.  By shoes.  That's, that's, really?  That's the number one fetish?  Feet?  Yeah.  In England or here?  They've even found somebody with a fetish for pacemakers.  I thought the number one fetish would be ass caving.  No.  What the hell?  No.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute, Ted.  That is impossible.  Wait.  Stop for one second.  I don't even know if we can go there.  What?  The word cave and ass.  I don't know. 
[01:26:30]  What?  All right.  All right.  No, apparently it's footwear followed by feet and toes.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Which is really weird for me.  That's a fun fact from Andy.  Thanks, Andy.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Let's go to Brooklyn.  It's Andrew.  Andrew, what's up?  I have a fun fact, too.  Yeah.  It's about the Spatial Endeavor.  Um, you know, the Spatial Endeavor, you know, the part that the, the Spatial Endeavor  was actually, was actually built. 
[01:27:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  The, the what?  Spatial Endeavor.  The, uh.  The Spatial Endeavor.  All right.  Wait.  It's, uh.  Hold on.  There's something wrong with the phones.  Uh, Andrew, right?  Yes.  All right.  Andrew from Brooklyn?  Yes.  Okay.  You're on the air.  What's up?  Um, Spatial Endeavor.  Um, that space, that spacecraft was actually built to replace the Challenger and the Spatial  Something about the Challenger.  Andy! 
[01:27:30]  I can't hear him.  What, what?  You can't hear him either?  No.  What ship, uh, was built for, uh, to replace it?  I said Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  What?  What Endeavor?  What?  Are we talking about, uh, what are we talking about?  No, it's, it's fun fact.  Oh, fun fact.  Okay.  So what's your fun, what's your fun fact?  It's what, Spatial Endeavor was built to replace Challenger and the parts that was, the parts 
[01:28:00]  that were used.  The, the what Endeavor?  I didn't hear that.  The space shuttle.  Yeah, okay, but which one, bro?  You talking about?  Yeah, which one?  The first one, and then there's another one.  What, I keep, because my, my, my, my.  Hold on, I'm getting a thumbs up from Tim.  The, we, we, uh, tweaked it.  All right, we got, all right, the phones are working.  Go ahead.  All right, you're going to have to start over.  Sorry.  Start over.  Sorry, Andy.  Go ahead.  This sounds really interesting.  Um, the space shuttle Endeavor, the part, the shuttle that replaced Challenger Endeavor 
[01:28:30]  was actually built with spare parts from the shuttles Discovery and Atlantis that were  left over when they were finished built.  From, from what?  When they finished building both.  The Atlantis?  No, I said, space shuttle Endeavor, it's the spare parts, I mean, the parts that were used  to build it.  Excuse me.  Yes.  The, um, the parts that they used to build the space shuttle Endeavor came from. 
[01:29:00]  Said it again.  Yeah, it came from.  It came from space shuttles Atlantis and Discovery.  Because they finished building, they finished producing the space shuttle.  Excuse me.  Yes, yes.  Yeah, sorry.  I'm sorry, I have a bad phone.  No, continue.  No, your phone's fine, dude.  It's a good phone.  That thing was messing up, though.  So, what, what, I don't understand, though.  You're saying the spare parts were used from Challenger? 
[01:29:30]  No, excuse me.  I'm saying space shuttle Endeavor.  The material that was used to build space shuttle Endeavor.  What about the other space?  What's the Challenger?  Yeah.  So, that was built to replace it.  Endeavor was built to replace Challenger.  And the spare parts, I mean, all the parts that were used to make Endeavor came from Discovery, Atlantis.  Came from Discovery and Atlantis because they were finished, they already finished building them. 
[01:30:00]  And the space, they stopped producing space shuttles after Atlantis.  Right.  Atlantis was built in 1985.  So, then, so they took those spare parts and made what?  Yeah, sum it up.  So, the what replaced the what with the what?  Endeavor replaced Challenger.  Wait, what's Endeavor?  Spatial Endeavor.  Right.  And the material that they used to build space shuttle were wrestlers from Discovery and Atlantis. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, God.  Wow.  So, the space shuttle in, what did he say?  Endeavor?  Endeavor.  Endeavor.  What is it?  Special Endeavor.  What is it again?  Say it.  You got to be clear, dude, and say it loud.  Yeah.  Space shuttle Endeavor.  Right. 
[01:31:00]  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that.  Well, it is fun fact Thursday.  You mush mouth.  We all learned something from Andrew in Brooklyn.  Yeah, thanks.  Thanks, Andrew.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Oh.  I think he was hit by the tornado.  Oh, my God.  Still feeling the effects.  My father used to burn me.  Special Endeavor.  Steven asks from Bayshore, does this idiot put Novocaine in his coffee?  I'm going to be saying that now all day.  Special Endeavor. 
[01:31:30]  Special Endeavor.  Don't want to attend Barry from Pittsburgh.  LOL.  He writes, the Spurs, he spells space, S-P-U-R-C-E, Spurs, shuttle, S-Z-U-T-T-L-E, and then Endeavor,  he spelled E-N-D-E-W-W-W-W-W-R-R-R-R.  Special Endeavor.  Ender.  Ender.  All right.  Yeah, we have to break.  We have to take a break.  I'll talk people.  Don't do this to me.  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened? 
[01:32:00]  I like Smurfette.  What happened?  I like Smurfette 79.  Oh, my God.  Oh, what happened?  Nothing annoys me or will initiate a bounce quicker than the long line of Z's.  Oh, no.  She writes, phone call, Z's.  Oh, no.  The long line of Z's are so annoying that she's going to be taking a little break today.  Ow!  Oh, how about this keyboard?  Anthony.  She's taking a little break.  Anthony.  Bye-bye. 
[01:32:30]  Yes.  Now go back in all the text, and anyone that used Z's in the last five minutes, ban them.  That's what you do.  There you go.  That's what you do.  Do it.  Hold on.  Oh, no.  Anyone that has Z, Z, Z in their text, they're done for today.  Pal talk.  There you go.  Bye-bye.  You've got to rule with an iron fist, pal.  Oh, they're screaming no, but if you use Z's.  Sorry.  If you use Z's.  They know I hate the Z thing.  When I look down and just see, we're in the middle of something, we're having fun, doing 
[01:33:00]  a show, and I've got to look and see Z's.  If you're bored and don't like it, I'll do you a favor.  I will make it so you can't listen.  All right.  Pal talk.  There you go.  Now go back, and everyone that used Z's.  Oh, I am.  Z's.  Z's.  Z's.  If I see any.  Oh, another one.  That's already gone.  All right.  Good.  Good.  Let me see.  Oh, I almost missed that.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Who else goes?  Who else goes? 
[01:33:30]  Well, let me see.  Oh, boy.  No code?  Did you bail out on me thinking I can't find you?  Look at that.  Look, look.  Not only.  Now, since you try to bail out no code, you're banned.  Not even bounce.  See, no code said I did Z's.  So what I'm going to do is bail out.  When this is over, I'll come back in.  Well, I looked under users recently leaving room.  Yeah.  And he was there.  So I highlighted him and hit ban.  Now he can't get back in until I unban him. 
[01:34:00]  Someone just wrote, I love Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, top.  Doesn't matter.  Doesn't matter.  Use disease.  Joke or no joke.  Use disease.  Where is that?  Goodbye.  Who is that?  Oh.  There it is.  All right.  I just tattled on someone.  Bye-bye.  Bouncy, bouncy.  I'm not playing around.  But they were using A's.  It ends now.  A, A, A, A, A.  I'm not playing.  All right.  Oh, there's another Z, Z, Z.  Wow.  That guy's ballsy.  All right.  He's gone.  Oh, another one. 
[01:34:30]  You got your hands full now.  That's all right.  It's going to be a room of nobody today.  That's all right.  Oh, but someone did Z, Z, Z, Z with winky eye.  Is that okay?  No.  We explained the winky eye yesterday.  No?  Not okay?  Oh, boy.  All right.  We'll figure that out.  We'll have the Larry King talking to the skateboarder next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Go.  The return of What the Hell is That to the Opie and Anthony show was an overnight success.  Oh, my God.  This is awesome.  Who could forget the sounds of cysts being ruptured and Bob Kelly vomiting into a bucket? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, Bob.  He's puking.  Well, we're going down that pus-filled road again, kids.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  If you have a bump, boil, bruise, legion, pustule, cyst, inflammation, or otherwise unidentifiable oddity on your person,  then you're perfect for What the Hell is That?  See?  That's why the show's called What the Hell is That?  Email Travis at foundrymusic.com with your ailment or freakish growth and your contact information,  and we'll have our crack team of medical professionals take a gander at it. 
[01:35:30]  Freaking all of his head!  And most likely giggle at it.  It's the return of the return of What the Hell is That on the Opie and Anthony show.  I can't explain how gross it is.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A, uncut, and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio, starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah!  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony.  Robert Kelly in studio. 
[01:36:00]  Robert Kelly live on MySpace, right, for all the info?  Yeah, that's it, yeah.  But basically, Bobby's playing Mohegan Sun this weekend.  Mohegan Sun Friday, Saturday night.  I love that place.  I love it, too.  I'm not a big casino guy, but I like Mohegan Sun.  They do a good job up there.  Yeah, it's not as cheesy as Foxwoods.  And the actual place we're playing, you guys went to the theater Jimmy was in, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we're playing that smaller theater.  Very cool.  Make sure you see Bob Kelly if you're in the area.  Hey, Larry King, we were supposed to get to this, 
[01:36:30]  but we got that fine phone call from, where was it, Brooklyn?  Spichon...  Spichon Dar.  I'm going to try to say that all day long.  You know, and I was thinking, we haven't seen our bits animated lately.  No.  There was a trend going on there for a while where a lot of our bits were being animated,  and man, we couldn't get enough of it.  I mean, we were watching all of them.  Coke Logic did some great stuff,  and some of the other guys, I don't know their names right now offhand, I'm sorry.  I'm thinking that might be a good one right there.  It would be so hilarious to see him... 
[01:37:00]  If you animate that.  But he's actually making a time machine behind him while he's on the phone with you,  and it's just like, he has a lightsaber that works.  Yeah, there's something very visual about that, you know?  I'm thinking Beautiful Mind, you know, all that crap's going on.  Numbers everywhere.  Yeah, at his home, and then you cut to us in the studio just laughing, and just...  His mother comes in, what are you doing?  I'm making a spatial endeavor, I'm fixing it.  Fun Fact Thursday. 
[01:37:30]  All right, we got Larry King interviewing Jake Brown,  and people are picking up on this and saying that it's the funniest interview ever.  I guess because, what, Larry King is pushing 80, and this kid's pushing, what, 17?  Yeah.  And Larry King could know nothing about skateboards.  Yeah.  Nothing.  But you've got to have, you know, the people making the news on Larry King.  Man.  One time, I took the bottom half off a scooter that was made out of a fruit box and a two-by-four 
[01:38:00]  and used it as a skateboard to get away from Biff.  You think Anderson Cooper is just giving Larry King, like, fried food every day?  You can't wait to step into his seat.  Larry's keeping it warm for now.  Well, so here we go, Larry King interviewing Jake Brown, of course a skater who fell almost 50 feet at the X Games.  Yeah.  Did you know you were in trouble?  Yeah.  By the time I got to the top of the ramp, I knew I was in big trouble. 
[01:38:30]  How badly were you hurt?  I think there was a lot of adrenaline at first because I wasn't really that hurt right away.  What's your injuries now?  I got a fractured wrist, a fractured vertebrae, and a bruised kidney, I mean, bruised liver and lung.  How long have you been skateboarding?  Some crazy whiplash.  About 20 years.  Why?  Oh, it's great fun.  I mean, once I picked up a skateboard, that's the way I wanted to. 
[01:39:00]  Why?  Why would you skateboard?  What an idiot!  Is that like transportation?  What do you do?  Why?  Why?  Because, first of all, the guy makes money doing it.  I mean, it's not like...  See, he thinks it's just kids in the street.  He doesn't realize it's a sport that is sponsored,  and these guys, if they're really good at the X Games, are making tons of cash with endorsement deals and everything.  Your skateboard?  Why?  Why?  Can you step on the back of it and, like, catch it in your hand? 
[01:39:30]  Do you do that?  What do you do?  This guy's been interviewing for over 50 years at this point.  A little research.  And he has to ask, why do you skateboard?  Why?  Because it's there!  What a tool.  But it came out so quick, too.  Like, he had it.  It's like, why?  So you do this with, why?  Well, that's what he did.  He, like, was blasting through the interview.  The guy was talking about his injuries, and he interrupted him.  What stupid question did he ask him? 
[01:40:00]  How long have you been skateboarding?  Yeah.  So what are your injuries?  Well, I got a bruised lung, and I say, how long have you been skateboarding?  Well, about 20 years.  Why?  Why the hell skateboard?  Why don't you settle down and get a real job and a woman?  Or a bunch of them like I've done.  I can't hold a one of them.  He's probably just speeding through the interview because he knows he might die at any second.  Why don't you have children now instead of when you're 80 like me?  Hey, I'll never see my kids skateboard. 
[01:40:30]  That sure ain't happening.  The interview continues here.  Where are you from?  Australia.  Can you make money?  Where's that?  Yeah, yeah.  That's a lot.  Australia?  They talk funny there.  And winter's summer.  Just want to throw that in.  Do you skateboard in the winter?  Do you put little skis on them?  I know nothing.  Do kangaroos know how to skateboard?  You ever see a wallaby? 
[01:41:00]  Isn't that how that crocodile had to die?  He got a skateboard in his lung?  He was skateboarding.  It flipped up and hit him in the chest.  I read about it while eating some garlic.  I had his wife and daughter.  Daughter's very cute and funny.  What's her name?  Binzie?  Do you like Welch's grape juice?  I like raisins.  Johnny from Vegas.  Larry King kind of sounds like annoyed Jimmy. 
[01:41:30]  He does sound like he's a bit annoyed with the whole thing that he had to interview this kid.  Some producer had to go, look, dude, this is big.  And Larry's like, state border?  What?  The war on Iraq?  The presidential race?  And I'm interviewing some people who fell 50 feet?  So what?  You fell on your ass.  I've done it.  You got to grab yourself by your bootstraps and pick yourself up.  Where are you from?  Australia.  Can you make money skateboarding?  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:42:00]  That's all I do.  Oh, my God.  What is it?  Yeah, in between pumping gas, I skateboard.  How out of touch is Larry King?  Larry knows nothing.  Can you make money?  Can you make money skateboarding?  He thinks he's some neighborhood kid that's hoping, you know, kids are going to give him a change for a trick.  I'll give you 10 bucks if you do that.  Okay.  What do you do?  You bet the neighborhood children?  Right. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's all I do to make money.  I mean, you make it at events like the exchange.  You make money.  You make money from sponsors and then events and demonstrations.  It's like he's talking to his retarded grandfather.  It says blind.  Is that a company that makes skateboards?  Yeah, that's his.  Oh, my.  Ha.  That's good.  Are you boning out some fat tricks?  Ha.  Ha.  That would be an informed Larry.  What are you doing?  A nolly half cab heel flip? 
[01:43:00]  Ha.  I remember doing that on the half pipe.  Ha, ha, ha.  What about a nose blunt?  Can you do a nose?  Can you make money doing a front side nose slide?  Ha, ha.  Tell me about it.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha. 
[01:43:30]  Ha, ha.  What's your stance?  Oh, my God.  This one sounds like something Opie had last night.  A backside disaster.  What about that speed wobble?  What about the backside nose grind?  Can you do that?  Do one for me now.  Oh, you can't?  I'll pay you for it.  I'll give you three bucks.  Can you make money?  Are they entertaining this? 
[01:44:00]  What I don't understand with Larry King is how would it hurt if you brought in a young dude to talk to the young dudes?  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Just maybe let somebody for ten minutes take over your stupid desk and get a real interview done.  Get somebody that knows, not even knows the sport, but is young enough where he's in touch with it.  Alex Rodriguez, you play baseball, you make money at that. 
[01:44:30]  Can you make money just, like, hitting a ball?  Do you get a pension plan?  Yeah, how does that work?  What about dental and skateboarding?  Do you put money into your 401k?  How do you supplement your income?  Like the old baseball players?  Are you a truck driver in the off-season to pay the bill?  Do you deliver pizzas with your skateboard just to make a little extra cash?  What a moron. 
[01:45:00]  He hates that.  When you're going up, what's the key to skateboard?  Do you do things that other guys don't do?  I mean, are there certain jokes that you do?  A lot of people have different tricks, like signature tricks and stuff.  What's yours?  See, he cuts them off.  You're right.  You nailed it.  Other guys have signature tricks.  What's yours?  Tell me now.  Jumping off a five-story building.  End this interview.  The biggest trick is getting through this interview with you, you wanker.  Signature tricks and stuff.  What's yours?  Uh, basically for videos, you film, when you film a video part, it usually takes about 
[01:45:30]  a year or so to film.  To film a video?  Yeah.  A year?  And it'll be like a two-minute segment for each writer or whatever.  What's your graffiti tag?  Wow, so you did an indie nose bone and then what?  Quick answer.  I got another question.  Oh, is he an idiot? 
[01:46:00]  Everyone's doing their Larry King on Instant Feedback.  Booby Man from Brooklyn in Larry's voice.  Why skateboard?  Why not the bike with the big front wheel and the little back wheel?  And then Kevin from Northern Virginia interviewing Bill Gates.  Can you make money in software sales?  What is that?  Like video games?  Like Pong?  Microsoft.  Are they one of your sponsors?  That tells me it's something small and soft. 
[01:46:30]  What does that mean?  We used to get a couple bricks and some plywood and do little jumps in my day, too.  That's right.  I used to jump over a milk crate.  Have you ever jumped over a milk crate?  It's not as easy as it looks, you know, kid.  Why skateboard when there's the horseless carriage?  Back in the day when I was 60 years old, I used to play Evel Knievel.  You ever do that with your bike in your front yard? 
[01:47:00]  You ever get a basket and make a basketball hoop for the kids in the neighborhood?  Our jumping events were mostly equestrian.  Jeez.  We would do the fox hunt.  The fox hunt.  Oh, man.  He is lost in this interview.  Lost.  Lost.  Oh.  Can I do some of these tricks on my little rascal? 
[01:47:30]  I have a little rascal scooter.  Is it possible to do, let's say, the electric Frankenstein on my little rascal?  Nate Sack from Jericho.  That's Larry.  I did this great trick last week on my show.  I killed off Tammy Faye Baker.  Nate just handed me a note that said equestrian, and then under equals horse, he knows how stupid I am. 
[01:48:00]  That's a horse.  Jason from Rye.  Microsoft.  Is that the opposite of Viagra?  I did a kick flip fakie the other day just getting out of my car.  I broke a hip.  Chester's liver.  Look, man.  I have to do this.  If you want to dump out, you can. 
[01:48:30]  As Larry King.  In my day, extreme was bringing home a black.  It just took a turn.  Come on.  That's just funny.  I'm sorry.  That's funny.  He's old and intolerant.  This just took a turn in the right direction.  No, no.  Never hear of the Motley Crue.  In my day, extreme was walking around the Puerto Rican neighborhood with your jewelry on. 
[01:49:00]  Brian from St. Louis with a callback, too.  Jake, talking about extreme.  Have you ever hunted a woolly mammoth?  That's extreme.  Now, on that jump, you caught some fat air.  Last time I caught fat air was the interview I had with Mama Cass Elliot.  She breathed on me.  Bill from Waterford.  Hey, kid.  What wife are you up to?  I'm up to six. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, God.  Funny.  Dopey Larry King.  Here we go.  More Larry King interviewing Jake Brown.  Boy, that's pretty great stuff.  Yeah.  How important is the board?  You know, can't you just put roller skates on? 
[01:50:00]  I don't know, Larry.  How important is that microphone in front of you, you idiot?  How important is the board?  How important is the board?  How important is the board?  Do you really need it?  Aren't the wheels the thing doing all the work?  Is there some kid just typing questions and just messing with them?  Type how important is the board.  See what he says.  Hey, what's your pump music? 
[01:50:30]  Benny Goodman?  That's some good stuff.  That should get you psyched.  How important is gravity to this whole thing that you do?  Do you need gravity?  Seemed to have hurt you the other day.  Gravity.  Would skateboarding be better done in space?  My question.  A knife troll bong.  Could you do that in space? 
[01:51:00]  Oh, is he gone?  Just off.  I got to hear that again.  Boy, that's pretty great stuff.  How important is the board?  By the way, I hate to tear down a wall.  You did not.  Because we do the exact same thing.  When you're fishing for your next question, when you have someone in studio,  you'll say something like this.  Boy, that's pretty great stuff.  You'll be like, wow, so that's because you're thinking of the next question in your head.  If he didn't say that, think how much dead air there'd be, because there was dead air 
[01:51:30]  after he said that, and came up with the brilliant, how important is the board question?  Tearing down another wall for you, but that's why.  That's good.  We got Chuck Yeager in studio.  How important are the wings?  Is that something you need in a plane?  That's pretty good, brilliant, awesome, kind of good stuff for you.  What an ass.  Just a douche.  That's pretty great stuff.  What is that? 
[01:52:00]  Boy, that's pretty great stuff.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How important is the board?  Uh, the board's one of the main things, the board, the shoes.  The shoes.  Why is the kid, I would have been like, Larry.  How important is the board?  How important?  Could you do this without a board?  I mean, could you just put wheels and then the...  Considering it's called a skateboard, how important is the board?  It came second.  Skate, I think, is more important than board. 
[01:52:30]  Hey, I think, Larry, what is that music called?  The pump music?  The, uh, what is it?  The pump music.  A little Benny Goodman.  Well, here's your pump music right here.  Oh, there it is.  Larry King on a skateboard, everybody.  Here comes my front side shove it.  All right, my kickflip lip.  This is great.  Into the quarter pipe, all goofy-footed.  Into a Smith grind. 
[01:53:00]  A Carbondale run into my Ollie Fakie.  Wow, am I kicking some ass.  All to Benny Goodman.  He sure could play the licorice stick.  Oh, man, we got the line.  That's why we have the greatest listeners in radio.  I'm not, you know, we give you, we give you a spot on this show.  That's for sure.  Brian in St. Louis.  Bravo.  Jake should have turned it around and said, well, how important is a good prenup, Larry? 
[01:53:30]  Wow.  That's the line right there, Brian.  All right, here, let's get the rest of this clip out there.  Boy, that's pretty great stuff.  Yeah.  How important is the board?  The board's one of the main things.  The board, the shoes, the wheels.  It all comes into play.  You want to feel comfortable with your entire setup.  The air we breathe.  He, he, that poor bastard probably wished, he probably wished he was back falling 50 feet 
[01:54:00]  than sitting and talking to this fossil.  Oh, man.  How is, how important?  What?  A train wreck, skateboard move, or this interview?  You tell me, callers.  There's only, but the thing is, there's nothing else to go, it's not like racing where there's  like a million, the car, the pit, the crew, the everything.  It's just a kid on a skateboard and that's it. 
[01:54:30]  If you, if you were going to use one skateboard lingo to describe me, would it be dope shifty?  Because I'm feeling like a dope shifty right now.  Someone from their cell phone, I would love to give you credit.  He writes, hold on, it's updated on me.  Oh, I hate when this happens.  Good line, too.  Ah, can't you just run up and down the ramp?  Could you use a toboggan? 
[01:55:00]  We used to, you know, sketch behind the ice truck in my neighborhood.  They deliver big chunks of ice to put into the ice box.  Andrew.  Andrew.  Andrew from Brooklyn.  That's the Space Shuttle in Denver guy.  Oh.  I just can't call that.  Now we can't talk.  All right, listen.  We, unfortunately, have to take a break. 
[01:55:30]  No.  Oh, we can continue.  I want to hear more Larry, please.  Is there more?  I got to hear more Larry.  And maybe we'll give you a Pat Duffy update next.  How's that?  Oh.  We're talking with a member of the 82nd Airborne.  How important is that parachute?  Do you see hoverboards like in Back to the Future 2?  Your thoughts?  Go. 
[01:56:00]  If Biff was chasing you, do you think you could guide him into a manure truck?  Go.  Do you think bowling balls would make skateboarding more interesting?  Oh, my God.  Your thoughts on marbles and skateboarding. 
[01:56:30]  Could you play Johnny B. Good if your hand was disappearing?  Thoughts?  We're talking with Marty McFly.  I mean, who?  What's your name?  I forgot.  What an out-of-touch tool.  Skateboarding with no ramps.  Your opinions and thoughts. 
[01:57:00]  Fireman from Pittsburgh as Larry.  One time, I got into a nosedive fakie, into a clueless bombslide, and I finished strong with a dead air 50-50.  Your thoughts?  I was kicking ass.  Your thoughts?  When I fell off the toilet, I drew this.  I call it the flux capacitor.  What do you think, Marty?  We're interviewing Pat Duffy. 
[01:57:30]  You can do this all day.  Are staples important?  Who's better, you or the bulldog skateboarding on YouTube?  Because that dog's pretty good.  He pushes himself.  I've never seen him fall 50 feet.  What is YouTube, by the way?  I shouldn't have even known that.  Holy crap, John from Brooklyn.  You know, a motley crew.  Oh, my God. 
[01:58:00]  This is good.  Larry King.  I like to introduce the, the, the.  Ah, bravo, John.  I got it.  All right, we got to take a break.  Hopefully, we'll get perv news in before we leave this side of the.  Is there any more Larry tape?  Unfortunately not.  Damn it.  That was about it, right, Sammy?  Yep.  That's when the kid hung up the phone.  Kid slapped.  What do you mean, do I leave my board?  Slap Larry on the side of the head with the skateboard and ran off. 
[01:58:30]  Oh, that was, that was great.  Yeah.  That was great.  Yeah.  Love Larry.  Yeah.  Such an out-of-touch ass.  All right, we'll take a breaky.  Opie and Anthony.  The, the Opie and Anthony show.  With Bob Kelly today.  Hey, do you want to play paintball with our very own Danny against the L.A.-based Adam Carolla morning show?  Well, you can win $5,000.  All you have to do is go to onawar.com for details. 
[01:59:00]  Made possible by the movie War, starring Jet Li and Jason Statham.  One wants justice.  One wants revenge.  And theater's August 24th.  onawar.com for all the details.  Free trip to L.A., why not?  Go for it.  We got perv news.  We got Andrew from Brooklyn.  See if this works this time around.  Andrew.  Hello. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, hi, Andrew.  Um, it's a fun fact that I want to talk about.  Okay.  Um, the Space Shuttle Endeavor, which launched yesterday.  Launched yesterday.  Um, that shuttle was built to replace Space Shuttle Challenger.  And, uh, we, uh, why do we, uh, why do we, uh, why do we still have a bad connection with  Andrew? 
[02:00:00]  Andrew!  Yes.  You're calling back.  Thank God, because we didn't hear you the, the, the first time you called.  You're calling from Brooklyn and you got a fun fact.  Yes.  Okay, go ahead.  Space Shuttle Challen, I mean, Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Space Shuttle Endeavor.  The shuttle that launched yesterday.  Space Shuttle.  That shuttle was built to replace Challenger.  Wait, what shuttle was replaced to build what?  Space Shuttle Endeavor was built to replace Space Shuttle Challenger, the one that exploded 
[02:00:30]  All right.  Enough of you.  He thinks he got a bad connection, so he called him back.  I swear to God.  Space Shuttle Challenger.  Mom, I have to.  Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Endeavor.  I have to explain this to Opie Anthony.  They don't understand me.  The Space Shuttle Endeavor.  Excuse me.  Mom.  Excuse me.  By the way, Pat Duffy's fine.  He's sitting over there.  Pat Duffy.  Oh, he got a staple in his head. 
[02:01:00]  It's Pat Effin Duffy.  Simple as that.  Pat Duffy is an animal.  His middle name is Effin.  Pat's an animal.  Pat Effin Duffy.  And he went a little loony yesterday.  Well, we went down memory lane.  We did this staple gun challenge back in the day, Bob.  Yeah?  Basically, we had a newspaper with a space shuttle.  Space Shuttle.  The guy's got Miss Shuttle Endeavor.  We had a newspaper with Space Shuttle Endeavor.  With really long staples. 
[02:01:30]  And so we put the paper up against our leg and then shot the staple into the paper and  then into our leg.  But it didn't hit the leg at first.  And then the challenge was I passed the paper on to Anthony.  He took a page out of the paper.  He took a page away.  And we kept going until someone said, no way.  I can't do this anymore.  And then the whole staple gun challenge ended with me just taking a shot into my leg, which  at the time was pretty damn impressive.  With a big staple.  Huge.  Yeah, nice.  It was one of those big staple guns.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  So Pat Duffy laughed at that yesterday. 
[02:02:00]  We had a staple gun around.  He popped it in your belly.  He started with his belly.  Popped one.  Long staples.  Long staples.  How long are we talking?  His gun's right there.  Right there.  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  Staple it into the newspaper and look how long the staple is.  Tom's running down the hall as we speak.  Don't worry about it.  He was in a panic yesterday.  Don't do it like that.  Do it into the newspaper.  Into the paper.  Yeah.  Now pull it out.  All right.  See how you can do it?  It went into the console.  And it went through the entire newspaper and into the console, right?  Pulled all the newspaper up, silly.  See? 
[02:02:30]  All right.  Now picture that in his belly, in his cheek, that instantly started pouring blood.  And then, for good measures, he put it to his forehead like a gun and shot it into his skull.  Now, here's what happened.  The edges of the staple, because it hit his skull, bent out.  Outwards.  To a 90 degree angle.  Like the staple did a split because it hit bone.  So now he couldn't pull it out because it was stuck. 
[02:03:00]  You moron.  Exactly.  So then we kind of all went into sort of a panic mode.  And then, like, Steve decided to get pliers and try to pull it out.  And you could hear, like, flesh almost ripping.  Yeah.  It was like a crunching.  Oh, my God.  Get the sound from Bob.  He'll puke.  It was a crunching noise.  You could find it.  It was a crunching noise.  Like, of fat cells, like going.  And it's in your head, and it hit your skull.  Yeah.  Did you feel it hit your skull?  Yeah.  It felt a little different than any other time I'd ever done it.  Yeah.  Oh, you've done this before. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  And here's the deal.  There was a lot of confusion yesterday.  A lot of people were really pissed at us.  Washington was pissed.  Tom was pissed down the hall.  And they thought we just picked some random intern and had him do this.  This guy, a backyard wrestler.  He was a backyard wrestler.  Got hit with Louisville sluggers wrapped in barbed wire.  Yeah.  Yes.  A little more than that.  The guy knows what he's doing.  Tax.  What was your name?  The crazy Amish.  No.  What was your name?  I had two different characters.  One was Big Larry.  He was a Mormon construction worker just laid off. 
[02:04:00]  Bent on revenge.  And the other one, bent on revenge from what?  That's not revenge.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Yeah.  What did he want?  Wait.  That's going to be your new catchphrase, by the way.  I love it.  Pat F and Duffy.  Bent on revenge.  Bent on revenge.  That's pretty realistic.  And a staple bent in his head.  Yes.  Yeah.  And your dad called while you were at the hospital yesterday.  He was not happy.  Yeah.  He's mad at me anyway.  He seemed like he was mad at us, too, by the way.  But Pat is fine.  He went to the emergency room.  He got one of those tetanus shots and some Motrin.  And even the big, huge lump is gone. 
[02:04:30]  He's good.  But I can still see a couple of holes in your head.  Yeah.  He's got the holes still.  See, we look to this side.  Looks like a little snake bite.  Yeah.  And what about your cheek?  That's fine.  Yeah.  Everything's fine.  So what was your...  Did that go straight through to the inside of your mouth?  Yeah, but it didn't go all the way through.  I heard the replay.  He said it pierced my cheek.  It didn't.  I checked when I was listening.  Oh.  We're like...  It was close.  It had to be close.  It had to be close.  Those staples were pretty long.  Pretty long, yeah.  This is why this guy's scary.  Because he's not even that big.  Like, you wouldn't think twice about messing with this kid.  He looks like just a regular pothead at a college. 
[02:05:00]  Like, what's up, man?  This kid...  This is the kid that you'd actually punch and he'd turn and go,  Uh, I didn't like that.  Yeah.  And he'd just kill you.  No, I gotta kill you.  Oh, God.  What was your other character name?  Oh, I can't say it on the side, but it was Skull F.  And he was the reincarnated...  He was the reincarnated zombie corpse of Adolf Hitler.  Oh, that character sounds intriguing.  To you?  Yeah.  No, no, it just sounds interesting.  My theme song was the Imperial March, and I came out goose-stepping.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  And did people cheer?  Literally, yes.  We had a shed that we came out, and we had entrance music.  Oh, God.  Oh, that's great.  You have videos of this, don't you?  I do, and it culminated with me getting 20 shots and nine staples in my arm.  See?  We knew what we were doing yesterday.  We knew this.  Pat, because of you, Pat F. and Duffy, I went home happy.  I don't care what, you know, Tom Allman, he's got a job to do.  He's the hall monitor.  I get it.  They're pissed in Washington.  I was so happy all afternoon yesterday. 
[02:06:00]  I'm like, that's good radio.  And Johnny from Vegas says it all.  He says, a good rule is that the more pissed the executives are, the happier the listeners  are.  Right.  Exactly.  Hey, did you have a mustache?  Did you grow any Hitler mustache?  No, I used to draw it.  Well, I had a skull mask that I drew a mustache on.  A Hitler mustache on it?  On the skull mask?  Yeah.  And you'd come out as a zombie reincarnated Hitler.  And I used to just stumble around and then, like...  And throw out, like, Hitler, Heil Hitler salutes.  Yeah, and I used to just yell, like, gibberish German.  I'm like,  Snoggin! 
[02:06:30]  Snoggin!  You're asking...  Like video games?  Yes.  Like Call of Duty?  Snoggin!  Yeah, fake German in those dumb games?  They're not saying anything.  Oh, my God.  You are an ass.  Could you imagine being the neighbors?  You're having a barbecue?  Your brand new outdoor pool?  Hey, kids, you're a brand new deck?  And then just to see him...  What did you wear as far as...  Jumping from the roof with a skull mask on?  Well, I had an old green suit jacket, and I wore my skull mask. 
[02:07:00]  And one of my buddies actually had actual Nazi memorabilia, so I had an actual Nazi armband  with blood on it.  Yeah, the swastika armband.  Yeah, the swastika armband, and I used to have a sword that I'd carry around, and that  was really it.  Actually, blood is going through his body.  Anthony's filling up right now.  I'm just imagining what you were saying.  The neighbors, what would they think seeing this happening in New York?  We're a pretty rural area, so...  Better than rural.  Yeah, but...  Where, Austria?  Where...  I'm in the middle of the woods.  Where was Mom and Dad as you're jumping off roofs? 
[02:07:30]  Just letting me do it.  Were they making crosses?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, you've got to bring the videos in now.  The listeners need to see some of the background.  Why, you have videos of this?  Yeah, they all...  We would have monthly events every month.  Where have you been?  Dude, anyone that has done backyard wrestling has video.  It's not even a question.  So video is a key part of this.  How important was the Hitler mask?  And the mustache.  It was essential to the character.  Now, goose-stepping.  This isn't popular.  Why would you do this?  What type of stapler do you use? 
[02:08:00]  A swing line?  See, so Pat Duffy laughed at that trick yesterday.  I know!  Everyone else panicked.  And even Pat Duffy's like,  I don't want to go to the hospital.  I've done this before.  Relax, everybody.  I don't want to ruin anyone's day.  Yeah, I didn't mean to piss everybody off.  Everybody got really mad at me.  Oh, dude.  No one got mad at you.  Emails, phone calls.  One boss talking to another boss.  It was just all-encompassing yesterday.  Agents getting involved.  It's like, well, everyone just relax.  It's Pat F and Duffy.  Just wait.  I got a few words when we go to the dark side today. 
[02:08:30]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, I do.  Oh?  I got a couple of words.  Is it the F word?  Can you stop?  Anthony, can you stop doing that?  What?  You keep grabbing the little loops on the back of your shoes  and pulling the back of your feet up to your ass like a dirty stripper.  Like a marionette.  You just look like the stripper when she's like doing that little move  and that she grabs the bottom of her high heels and pulls it up.  You know, no one would look at me ever, no matter what I was doing.  If I was stripping on that pole, no one would look at me and say I look like a stripper. 
[02:09:00]  I'm just lifting my shoes up.  You're lifting your feet.  It's fun.  You put your fingers in your little loops at the back of your shoes that you used to pull them on  and you pull them up and down.  I'm sitting here.  What am I supposed to do?  Hey, we got to do a little perm news before we get out of here.  Pat Duffy, please plug your mom's flower shop.  Krause's Flowers in Clinton, New Jersey.  Krause!  Krause's!  Krause!  Exactly.  K-R-A-U-S-E-S flowers dot com.  Buy some flowers.  Support my family.  He got a hospital bill yesterday, so go buy a bouquet of something. 
[02:09:30]  Duffy will be getting that pretty soon.  All right, that's it.  Where Tom's going to run in and shake you down for some cash.  Yeah, really.  I'm sure half the sales staff is on the phone with the flower shop right now.  Would you like to buy some time on the opening of the show?  Somebody actually called a stapler sponsor.  A stapler company yesterday.  Yeah.  I swear to God.  They're geniuses back there.  They are.  They're smart.  They're geniuses.  Soon, a man appears wearing a red cap.  Uh-oh.  I'm in trouble here.  With one signal, he's there for sex.  What?  Deputies say he exposed himself three times during a canoeing trip. 
[02:10:00]  Hey, look at my...  He walks naked with a ski mask covering his face.  Hey!  Now they say he's hiding on porches, looking through windows.  Right next.  I'll be in happening.  They're men hunting for another man to have sex with.  They're men hunting.  That's a great, great promo for Perv News.  Good one.  We'll do one quickie, and then we've got to get out of here.  All right.  This goes for nude run at high school track. 
[02:10:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  A Catholic priest is facing an indecent exposure charge after police say he jogged naked at a high school track.  It can happen in the town of Frederick, north of Denver.  Fox 31's Tanny Vigil is on here tonight.  Ron, the 53-year-old father heads three Catholic churches in this area, including St. Teresa's here.  Tonight, the church is quiet, no services, but there will suddenly be prayers for the father as his case proceeds through the courts.  He's a man of the cloth accused of not wearing any. 
[02:11:00]  Ah.  I get it.  He admitted to running naked at the track at Frederick High School an hour before sunrise, June 22nd.  My first thought was total shock.  What was that?  My first thought was what?  I don't know.  I just like to smoke in the lab.  That's all I care about.  My first thought was to...  What the F or something, I'm sure, right? 
[02:11:30]  Why don't they get it?  A man of the cloth not wearing any.  No, the priest is claiming innocence in this story.  How can you claim innocence?  Because it was before the sun rose, and he's got an excuse.  Here it is.  A police report quotes Whitkey as saying,  I'm a heavy man, and wearing clothing while running makes me sweat profusely.  Then said, I know what I did was wrong.  But a report by another officer says Whitkey said,  he really did not think much about it because it was so early in the morning, 
[02:12:00]  and he did not think anyone would be out.  But an officer was out watering his garden when Whitkey allegedly walked by to get to his home at the rectory nearly across the street.  I feel bad for him.  I would be totally embarrassed if I was him, and I think I would probably leave the parish.  All right, what's this about, really?  So he's still naked walking home, too?  Right.  I don't know.  What's this about?  He has a pack of cigarettes and a Coke.  Fat guy. 
[02:12:30]  You know.  Sweaty.  He has dry cleaning over one shoulder.  Did a bunch of errands.  If you sweat a lot, you could, you know, at least keep your underpants on.  Shorts.  Yeah, loose-fitting shorts, fatso.  When it's really hot out, if I'm going to exercise, I'll take my shirt off, and I'll wear no socks and sneakers.  You know what I mean?  Why do you have to be completely naked?  Naked.  If you're fat, you don't take your clothes off.  This guy was getting his jollies.  How important are the clothes? 
[02:13:00]  He just loves being naked, probably.  Probably does this all the time and finally got caught.  Residents tonight sounding off on the father's excuses for running in the buff.  I mean, you're a priest, you're a role model to the town.  You shouldn't be, even if it's 4.30 in the morning, even if it's 2.30 in the morning, you shouldn't be running around naked.  It's a law.  You should do it behind closed doors.  Right.  There's treadmills out there that he can do it on in his own home.  An alleged sin, church members may be able to forgive, but if convicted, he'll have to register as a sex offender. 
[02:13:30]  Catholic Archdiocese said today we take this matter seriously and have been addressing the situation.  Based on the information the Archdiocese has, it does not appear Father Whitkey's actions involved any other individual  adult or child.  Now, the priest's lawyer said he nor his client had any comment.  I love the...  Are there any boys involved?  Young boys?  No.  Oh, well.  This is not...  Why are you even talking to us? 
[02:14:00]  You know what...  I love the who gives a crap statement they have to release.  We're taking this matter seriously.  Very seriously.  What?  Of course you are.  People don't understand.  He's not doing it to be a pervert.  He's a werewolf.  Oh, he had just gotten back into human form.  Yeah, and then he's actually going home.  Everyone knows the clothes rip off of you when you become a werewolf.  Yeah, he's a priest werewolf.  Not like in the movies where you have little pants left.  Right.  You've got to be naked.  What was the cop doing out watering his lawn at 4.30 in the morning? 
[02:14:30]  It's a little odd.  Cop was probably nude, too, and said, oh my God.  Oh!  Well, here's my lucky day.  The uncomfortable part is the priest still had his collar on.  Just the collar.  He just had the collar with Reeboks.  With a swoosh.  He had a swoosh collar.  A swoosh.  It was like a sweatband.  Oh, man, we're running out of show on this side.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  Good place to leave it, I guess.  Bobby, thank you.  Absolutely.  Always fun having you here, boy.  Robert Kelly live.  He's playing Mohegan Sun this weekend.  Friday, Saturday night, baby.  Because we're on the wolf up there, so, you know, getting the plug in for you.  I think I've got to call into them today.  Ow!  All right.  You want to take the jet up there?  Yeah, I'll take the jet.  I'll take that from Republic Airport.  They offered me the jet.  I want to take the hovercraft.  There is none.  There's no floating buildings or hovercraft. 
[02:15:30]  Floating buildings.  Got Opie all upset.  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Have a great day.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Ma'am.  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  And here we are at XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:19:00]  Radio, radio, radio.  In between shows, Anthony and I, we go down the hall there.  And this is why...  Don't just go down the hall, skipping, holding hands.  Well, this is why they have to, you know, finish our studio.  Because we're still in the same place, so CBS radio taking advantage of that, and in between  shows, they're like, oh, can you read this?  Can you do this?  Can you do this production?  Can you do this sweeper, a promo, this, that?  Can you quickly meet with the sales team? 
[02:19:30]  Can you do this?  Can you meet with the PD?  Tom needs to talk to you.  You know, we had the greatest excuse ever.  The show ends.  We gotta go.  We gotta go, man.  We gotta go.  But now they're kind of like taking advantage of this situation, getting us to do all sorts  of stuff.  But today, we did some production for XM.  And there's a new client, I guess, coming on board.  Welcome, welcome, welcome.  And we did the first commercial for them, in between shows, and here it is. 
[02:20:00]  This is what we do between shows.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Between studios.  What?  What are you doing over there?  I'm just getting a little gum from the intern.  Leave the intern alone.  What am I doing?  I'm not doing nothing.  She's a girl.  Leave her alone.  I whispered something to her, and she brought me the wrong thing.  Oh, really?  I whispered something, and she thought I said, I want gum.  Oh, my God.  Bobby!  I just went with it. 
[02:20:30]  We had a deal with intern issues yesterday for hours.  Just stop.  Yeah.  She can't read my lips well.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Nothing?  No, that was good.  It's really funny, but we gotta make believe we're responsible.  Yeah, so that's terrible.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  That's hard.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  So we did commercials, Bobby, in between shows.  And there's a new sponsor for XM, and it's some company that helps fix your computer.  Yeah.  When it's feeling sick.

[02:22:30]  Holy shit, okay, okay, I'll call.  Quit yelling at me.  Stop yelling.  Why are you yelling?  Hey, speaking of commercials, this was brought up on yesterday's show,  and we couldn't get it to you right away.  We had to go dig it up in the archives.  The Mujan live read.  Mujan.  Featuring Otto and George.  This I have not heard in years.  What was Mujan again?  Mujan was a hair removal system.  Right.  It was like waxing. 
[02:23:00]  And it was a sponsor of ours.  And we're talking about it, and, you know, you got to do it like the sponsor wants you to.  And Otto, as, you know, George, just went on and ripped the product apart.  It was hysterical.  And we're kind of like, oh, Jesus.  It's reminding me of the, one of the faithful listeners will remember the name of the product,  but Tim Sabian, you know, good friend of ours back in the day.  Yeah.  Sweet release.  That's what it was.  Sweet release.  Dude, we were so hot at Afternoon Drive Radio. 
[02:23:30]  Everybody wanted on to advertise with our show, right?  This guy was friends with Tim Sabian.  He goes, I have $200,000, and I want to advertise with Opie and Anthony and the sales staff.  And everyone's like, sure.  What's your product?  It's called Sweet Release.  Yeah.  Sweet Release.  It's a tablet that you take, and your cum tastes like apples.  Really?  Crisp apples.  Or cherries or bananas.  It was like different flavors. 
[02:24:00]  Makes your stuff taste like a hard, crisp apple.  Hard, crisp apple.  And they were working on other flavors.  And we looked around like, you're shitting us, right?  You're filming this.  You know, stop.  We're in on the joke now.  We're not this stupid.  They swore that this was real, and we actually ended up running commercials for this dumb product.  Did you ever test it?  No.  No.  Why?  Huh?  Take a nice pill, and then...  We took this guy's 200 Gs, though, man.  No problem. 
[02:24:30]  No problem.  Sweet, crisp apple.  Yeah.  That's what you want.  All right.  Yeah, a nice sour-tasting load.  Come here, honey.  So here's Otto and George.  So here's Mujan.  Tastes like an apple in a pool for a week.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  By the way, the X-Amers get really upset.  There's a beep in this, because it's the only copy we have, and it's from the old days,  that we can't do anything about it. 
[02:25:00]  Occasionally, we did do stuff over there that actually got beeped.  Yeah, so we were doing this live read for Mujan, some hair removal system, and Otto and George  was in studio, and this is what happened.  Uh-oh, I hope we have a lot of delay for this commercial.  Anthony?  Yes.  Mujan.  Mujan.  Mujan.  Mujan.  Mujan.  You want to explain to George the Puppet what Mujan is?  Mujan is a wonderful way for women to get rid of unwanted body hair. 
[02:25:30]  Bikini line, legs, even mustaches, facial hair that girls might have, and it's so much better  than shaving.  Nipple hair, whatever it is.  It leaves the body very smooth.  Mujan.  Is that like electrolysis?  No, it's a strip that comes in a package of the Mujan 2000.  You press it on and peel it off, and completely smooth.  Wonderful, smooth, sexy skin.  The name is smooth.  It's basically yanking pubic hairs out. 
[02:26:00]  Mujan.  Should be called...  Ah!  Oh!  You know, we just spoke at the people from Mujan.  Yeah.  We had a demonstration in our office.  It is quick, painful, and completely removes hair.  Do you have a hairy knish?  Try Mujan.  Here's you.  Ah!  I hope the bastard appreciates this.  Making my t*** hairs out by the root, so I look good in a sundress. 
[02:26:30]  Ugh.  Ah!  It should be called...  Ah!  Oh, sorry.  Yankee?  Wait, wait.  That line has to be on the radio.  Oh, it's great.  Thank you.  It's easy.  Peel, press it off.  Press it on and pull it off.  Unwanted hair, gone.  Almost painless.  No.  Set it apart where you...  Ah!  No unpleasant odors or chemicals to irritate the skin. 
[02:27:00]  Mujan, gentle, has botanicals, hypoallergenic, removes hair completely.  It's slow to grow back.  Lighter, thinner, skin is softer, sexier than before.  Mujan.  It's wonderful.  You always throw that aloe in there.  There's aloe in there?  What is that?  I'm bleeding.  I'm going to go to a hospital.  There will be...  There will be no blood from Mujan.  It's wonderful.  It's so gentle.  We saw a demonstration.  The hair comes off.  You don't even feel it. 
[02:27:30]  I know it's biting at this point.  It's the most desirable way to remove hair.  You know what else is good?  Closing a storm window on your testicle is also good.  You know, for the hot weather, just drop a storm window on your tea bag.  There's aloe in that window.  You want some aloe for your testicle?  Mujan, the most comfortable way to remove hair at home.  Why pay those salon prices? 
[02:28:00]  Mujan removes hair completely.  If you don't see Mujan, go to the store manager and say,  Hey, my girl's got a poodle in her lap.  I need Mujan.  And I got actual audio of a girl?  Yes.  After she, you know, waxed her hair.  Okay, let's hear it.  See?  It's so smooth.  She's so sexy.  She doesn't even need a brain anymore. 
[02:28:30]  Amazing.  So to get hair off of that...  PUSSA!  No one even heard this spot, but it's hilarious.  I don't even give a crap.  Ten people on hold are enjoying this.  Yeah, they hear the unedited version.  Oh, yeah.  Not anymore, Otto.  There's aloe in there.  Thanks for asking ahead of time.  You get hit by a truck that's carrying aloe. 
[02:29:00]  Does it still hurt?  Ponder that one for a while.  Mujan.  The best way to remove that unwanted body hair.  All right.  Ask for it at a cosmetics store near you.  And we're back live.  Wow.  Wow.  There were so many things going on in there.  The first thing I noticed was the fact that I'm so flustered that I said it's quick and painful.  I go, we tested it in the office. 
[02:29:30]  It's quick.  It's painful.  It removes hair.  That was on the radio back in the day.  Oh.  Ah, PUSSA!  Wow.  You can't say nipple hair anymore on radio.  No.  No.  And then I throw in that dumb song in the middle of it.  But E-Rock is explaining that it made sense at the time because it was a song we were trying  to get stuck in everyone's head.  Blah, blah, blah.  Whatever.  Oh.  But for the most part, you can't play that.  No.  Fuck no.  People are calling it the best live read ever.  Yeah, that was a good one. 
[02:30:00]  I still like Jim Brewer's Razor Rollerboard.  Yeah, the Razor Rollerboard one was great.  Let's say hi to Adam in Connecticut.  Adam!  Oh, man.  Buffet molester.  How's it going?  Ooh.  You guys got to play that Mexican auto parts commercial you guys used to do.  Oh, Strauss.  Yeah, they made me do it in Spanish.  Bobby, we were so, we had such huge ratings that we somehow were bleeding into people that  only speak Spanish. 
[02:30:30]  And we didn't really understand why, but they were listening.  We had such a buzz with our show that Spanish people were trying to listen even though they  didn't speak English.  They actually got this sponsor, Strauss, and they wanted a Spanish commercial to run during  our show.  Swear to fucking God.  And they wanted me to do it in Spanish, and I don't know Spanish, so they spelt it  out phonetically, and I read it, and it's awful.  Like, people that speak Spanish listened to it and went, what are you even saying? 
[02:31:00]  It's horrible.  Do you have that?  Yeah, but I'm getting...  It's a 12-minute bit, though.  I'm getting a communique.  It's a 12-minute bit.  We don't have just the read.  What do we have?  Him trying to do the Spanish?  Live, yeah.  Yeah, because he's trying to do the Spanish, and we don't speak...  Well, I guess I took Spanish, but I don't speak it either.  I don't know.  Even spelled phonetically, you don't know when they put in those wacky little things they  put in.  How about we play it at 11?  Yeah.  All right, we'll play it when we leave today.  That's a good one.  Yeah, we'll do that.  Spanish people around a slushy machine with an interpreter. 
[02:31:30]  He said pussy.  Hey, where's Gary Goleman?  Puss off.  Coochie.  Bring Gary in.  Gary's a...  Is Gary playing Caroline's this weekend?  No, it's not Caroline's.  It's a...  Oh, shit.  It's actually...  Nah.  One of their competitors, Gotham Cop.  Oh, Gotham.  Okay.  Yeah, he's at Gotham all weekend.  All right.  Which is a fine club.  Sorry about that.  Good one.  Gary Goleman was on Torgasm with you.  Me and Gary, Torgasm, baby.  Dude, I gotta apologize.  You walked by me three times and I didn't see you?  Oh, maybe. 
[02:32:00]  What's up, bro?  Good to see you.  He's 6'6", and Bob's like, he walked by you three times.  Yeah, he's like the Jewish Superman, and he walked by you like six times and you didn't  see him.  I didn't see you.  Good looking six foot six dude walks by you.  You don't notice?  Well, why the hell did I notice?  All right.  Well, maybe you shouldn't notice.  What's up, Gary?  Nothing.  Good to be here.  Thanks for having me on.  I really appreciate it.  Oh, no worries.  Yeah.  No problem.  I saw the Torgasm tour.  What was it?  It was you.  Long Island.  Long Island, yeah.  It was you, Gary, and Jay. 
[02:32:30]  Jay.  Jay from L.A.  Jay from L.A.  Is that his name?  And Gary was so fucking funny.  I'm like, God, we gotta get him on the show.  Oh, thanks.  And then eight months later, we did it.  It's interesting here.  Eight months.  I'm glad you have goals.  Let's just put it this way.  He was doing Christmas material, so it had to be like eight months to go.  Yeah, it was a while ago.  It was in December.  In fact, a friend of mine who came to the show just had a baby.  Mm-hmm.  So she must have just gotten knocked out that week or something like that. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, because I ran into you guys backstage, and I went up to Gary.  I'm like, that was really funny.  We gotta get you on the radio.  We'll get you on soon.  Here it is, eight months later.  There's actually a new human was born.  Yeah.  In the time between.  The gestation period is getting out of the show.  Yeah, the entire gestation period.  But Gary's playing Gotham all weekend long, starting tonight at 8.30.  Tickets 212-367-9000.  In between shows, Big Ken called me from Philly. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  You know, the Barry Bonds thing.  Yeah.  The home run.  Okay.  A lot more info coming in on this freaking ball.  First of all, the guy almost got killed.  Like, when he finally got the ball after bouncing around in the stands, he fell on top of it,  and then everyone piled on.  Everyone did a pile on.  Wow.  And his comment was he was just praying that the cops would get there in time before he died.  That's how sick it was in the stands.  Yeah, you would get crushed.  You think you could breathe?  They're all trying to grab.  You know, a bunch of hands are probably underneath trying to grab them, punching them. 
[02:34:00]  And I don't think, you know, I can't breathe, get off me is going to help at that point.  Oh, okay.  Oh, all right.  Someone's getting hurt here?  They don't give a shit.  That's a lot.  Like you said yesterday, it's a lottery ticket, bouncing around in the stands.  I hate that.  Even when I played Little League, when you hit the home run, and then you come to home,  and they all pig pile on top of you.  I never liked the pile on.  I remember just crying on the bottom of that pile.  You hit a home run in Little League?  Yeah, I hit a home run.  I'm so jealous.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But my dad wasn't there, ever. 
[02:34:30]  I had to use other people's parents to buy me like a root beer after the game.  Hey, Robbie, here.  This is for you.  We have to go.  Have a nice walk with your lonely glove.  You got to play catch against a wall?  Yeah.  I had to actually play catch with my sister, and they actually put her on a team because  she was better than me.  Oh, you just got to chuck the ball straight up in the air and practice catching pop flies.  And dream of having a dad. 
[02:35:00]  Oh.  At least having one that cares.  Oh, wow.  So sad.  In sixth grade, my actually sixth grade teacher, we had a father-son potluck supper, and I  was the only one that couldn't go.  So he actually went with me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  He was my dad for the day.  And I actually kind of treated him like a dad, and I think it weirded him out because  I was sitting next to him, and I was kind of like just, you know, kind of being like,  hey, you know, talking to him.  And he was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Listen, you're my student.  Relax.  Oh, God. 
[02:35:30]  That's embarrassing.  Yeah, I'm the product of a broken home, too, and father figures were everywhere.  Everywhere.  Really?  Yeah, the carpet salesman at Sears, the mailman, everybody.  Want to shoot some hoops?  They all felt bad, dude.  I thought they gave you ten minutes in between deliveries.  Gary's mother has to be one of the funniest moms I have ever met.  And she is, you know, you picture Gary's mom.  I always picture, like, a lady, you know, I don't know, like, you know, just, hi, how  are you?  Nice to meet you.  I'm Gary's mom. 
[02:36:00]  His mom is the funniest lady ever.  She just comes up.  She goes to all my shows in Boston.  When I'm in Boston, and I'm dirty.  And when I'm in Boston, I'm disgusting.  And I used to get nervous the first time there.  She'd be like, I'm here.  I'm Gary's mom.  And she's just like a Boston mom.  And she's like, you know, you were wonderful.  And I just talked about the inside of a vagina for 20 minutes.  But that was so funny.  Meanwhile, I say shit.  She writes me out of the will and won't even talk.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not allowed to swear to her.  You get the voice mail from mom.  Gary, that's not you.  Leave that to Bobby. 
[02:36:30]  I went to one of these father-son things that reminds me, because my parents divorced pretty  early on.  But they were together long enough to make me completely miserable by them being together  during my time I was in school, elementary school and stuff.  And I wanted them to do things.  Like, I wanted them to be real parents and stuff and go on.  Like, I wanted my mother to be the mother that went on the field trips on the bus and stuff.  And I wanted my father to go to the father-son things.  And they went to a couple of them.  And all I know is they were constantly hung the fuck over. 
[02:37:00]  No.  Like, so bad.  Because they had to be drunk at night to even deal with each other.  It was just a wreck.  So one time, I went to go see You're a Good Man Charlie Brown or something in the city here.  You know, take the bus out from Long Island, field trip.  Yay.  And my mom was all gussied up like a whore.  You know, she got, she has.  Well, I used to, I used to like tell her, could you put your hair in pigtails and wear your go-go boots and a skirt? 
[02:37:30]  And so I would tell my mother this because all my friends would be, your mommy's so pretty.  Like, I wouldn't think of it in any sexual way.  I just liked how people would compliment my mommy.  Oh, my God.  And meanwhile, she's dressed like a stripper.  And she's hung over.  Like, so she's sitting in the bus, in the back of the bus, swigging Pepto-Bismol out of a bottle.  And I'm sitting at Radio City Music Hall watching this big Charlie Brown movie.  And she goes, I'll be right back.  She goes to the bathroom where she's just puking and having diarrhea. 
[02:38:00]  Exactly.  And she comes back and it makes me feel better.  She bought me like a program from the show.  And she's just sitting there, like you can still smell alcohol on her.  And then my father was even worse.  We went to a father-son breakfast thing.  Yeah.  And he, again, hung over.  We drive to this place.  We get there 20 minutes late because he got lost.  So we show up and now everybody like turns around.  And he's just, you can just see it in his face.  And you know how adults, like kids, I didn't know.  The kids don't know. 
[02:38:30]  But the other parents can look and just go, oh, fuck.  Look at Joey's just fucked up, you know.  So he sits down and then proceeds to blast out the worst drunk farce ever.  And embarrassing the shit out of me.  Like everybody's going, holy shit, what's that?  And my father's just lifting a cheek, laughing.  Just constant embarrassment.  That sounds good.  Oh, horrid.  My second dad used to punch me in the face. 
[02:39:00]  Your second dad.  I'd take a fart over that any day.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, I actually remember my second dad.  We got in a fight because my mother got remarried and because she's a whore.  And we actually, we got, we got, she, the second dad had a fight.  I'm like, I'm calling my dad.  I'm going to go live with my dad.  Threaten him.  Like, you know, my mother goes, go ahead.  Call him.  So I called him like, dad, you know, I'm crying.  I can't live here.  You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And he goes, look, put your mother back on the phone.  And she goes, I told him. 
[02:39:30]  I, you know.  And he just hangs on his phone.  He doesn't want you either.  Oh, wow.  He doesn't want you either?  Yeah.  And that's when I started killing small animals.  And blowing guys.  That'll put you in show business right there.  It's just tragic.  That will put you right in show business.  Trying to get the attention of everybody.  Like, they just didn't get it back then.  They thought, you know, all right, we fucked.  We had some kids.  Let's get married and make them miserable for long enough.  And then, you know, we'll split up.  And then we'll send them on their fucking neurotic ways to do whatever the fuck they're going to do. 
[02:40:00]  It's like, gee, thanks.  Thanks for putting in the effort.  And my father had to move to California to get far enough away from my mother.  Like, they were just miserable together.  Miserable.  And then I get shipped out there.  And then back here.  Oh, I told you the time.  My mother bought me a ticket.  I got to tell you real quick.  My mother bought me a ticket because I said, I got to get back to New York, California.  I'm not doing anything here.  I'm stagnating. 
[02:40:30]  This is when I finally got a little older and realized, oh, my God.  Unless I want to sit out in front of a horse stable drinking a 40 of Bud with my father and his friends,  I better get back to New York and at least give school a shot.  So my mother goes, okay, I'll send out money for the plane ticket.  Sent out the money for the plane ticket.  My father takes it, buys me a Greyhound bus ticket at 14 years old and uses the money for the rest of the money.  Takes it, shoves me on a bus and sends me on a two-week trip from L.A. to New York City with winos, prostitutes on a whirlwind tour of the dregs of society. 
[02:41:00]  The shitholes towns.  That should be a movie.  That has to be a movie.  Believe me.  Don't I find funny?  Instead of a six-hour plane ride, it's a two-week tour of the shithole of America.  Where the first night I fell asleep on the back of the seat of the bus, I woke up and half my head was numb.  I thought I had a stroke at 14.  And it didn't go away for a month.  My side of my head and one thumb went completely numb on me for a month. 
[02:41:30]  And I was like, I gotta go to a doctor.  This is fucked up.  And apparently I just cut off the blood flow long enough to my scalp where it didn't come back alive for a month.  And he gave me money.  He gives me money to get across and he gives me like 20 bucks for food for like two weeks.  We stop in Vegas and I'm like, I need more money.  So I get some change and I'm 14 at the slot machine sneaking around.  I lost the 20 bucks.  So I had no money left.  So I hooked up with this girl that was going to Cheyenne. 
[02:42:00]  And she had some food and some money and shit.  And she wound up with me and my brother because my brother was with me.  But, you know, he wasn't older than me by 18 months.  Wow.  And, yeah, we wound up going there.  But my brother had tie stick in his luggage.  So we had to give it to the girl in Cheyenne because we got arrested when we got off the bus because they thought we were runaways.  It was just tragic.  Did you have a stick with like a bandana on the end of it?  Yeah, that was pretty much it.  My dad just shoved us off there. 
[02:42:30]  He would do that shit all the time, though.  Our vacations consisted of taking the kids out to the Mojave Desert with tequila, doom buggies and guns and just throwing us to the frigging animals and whatever we wanted to do until 10-year-old Charlie got shot.  And I had to watch a 10-year-old get shot by his father.  His own father shot him.  He had a six-shooter that was like ancient.  I got to jump in.  This never gets old.  It's such a real story. 
[02:43:00]  I've heard this story, fuck, 10 times.  Constantly drunk.  It makes me laugh every fucking time.  Constantly drunk.  And this guy, Juan Reyes, had a silver mine up there that was like devoid of silver.  It was just a hole in the ground that we used to camp in.  And he had this six-shooter that had to be quarter-cocked to spin the cylinder to load it.  It's an old gun because the firing pin rested directly on the bullets.  You're supposed to quarter-cock it, load it with five shells, put the firing pin on the empty chamber, and then you're safe for the most part. 
[02:43:30]  He quarter-cocks it, loads every cylinder.  As he's picking the gun up, it fires.  It's a .22, thank God.  It wasn't something bigger.  But it hits his son Charlie square in the left shoulder, but low, like chest-shoulder area.  Charlie goes, I see a 10-year-old drop to his knees, and the blood shot out like a water fountain, straight out in a tube.  I was looking going, that is so weird. 
[02:44:00]  It looks like a tube of red coming out of him.  He turned white and fell flat on his face.  And his father, now this guy was like a tough guy.  I know this guy, Juan Reyes, is like this tough guy, goes, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.  He grabs him, and he's shaking him.  Now everyone's drunk and fucking, like, trying to figure out how we're going to get this kid 80 miles to Kingston, Arizona.  And when he means everyone's drunk, he means the kids as well.  Everyone.  We were all drinking tequila.  Yeah, and they're 14 years old. 
[02:44:30]  So they load him in the back of a pickup truck.  We're in between Barstow and Needles, Arizona, like, in the middle of nowhere.  And they have to drive the kid, like, 50 miles at least.  They're the closest, like, fucking Indian witch doctor.  And we're all just there.  So they leave us kids there.  And then the police show up because it's a shooting.  And they came up with their guns drawn, lights, everything.  Because they didn't know.  They thought we were like the Manson family out in the desert fucking shooting each other.  Why would they think that?  Because we kind of were. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah, exactly.  You should have been raised by the Manson family.  It would have been a better fucking parenting than what was done.  Holy shit.  We would go out in this tomb buggy.  A kid would drive.  Like, the 10-year-old would drive.  We'd be hanging over the roll bar like Rat Patrol, fucking shooting anything that moved.  Poor fucking jackrabbit.  Blam!  With my father's fucking, like, 7mm with a weaver scope on it that I could shoot 10 miles away.  I got, like, a sniper rifle with me to shoot fucking iguanas with. 
[02:45:30]  Just hire you to protect the borders.  Yeah, and they would go out like we were going out to play ball.  Like, I'm taking the dune buggy and the rifles to shoot shit.  All right, kids, have fun.  And they would drink and just fucking hang out until they passed out.  And we would all just shoot shit.  And apparently each other.  He's dead.  Oh, don't I feel like a fucking asshole?  No, that's okay.  Let me tell you something.  Don't turn that way either.  Don't you turn. 
[02:46:00]  My dad's dead too.  I don't have a daddy anymore.  And the anniversary of my dad's death is two days away.  So enjoy.  Good one, Gary.  Good one.  Don't assume and maybe, you know, kind of put a few feeler questions out there.  Maybe ask a few questions before you come in here, you know.  How's your dad doing now?  Oh, dead.  Oh, this is.  Yeah, my dad's dead too.  He probably looks something like this now.  Oh, jeez.  It's like his jaw dropped, you know, like the Indiana Jones skeletons. 
[02:46:30]  They all got the jaws out of like.  Rasputin.  Yeah.  Like big hissing cockroaches coming out of his eyes.  I fucked up Pete so bad at the last virus show.  We're backstage and I'm, we're watching Louis CK and I'm having kind of a moment because  it was my dad's birthday when we were doing the Detroit show.  Oh, Jesus.  And I'm sitting there kind of like, you know, like all of a sudden some thoughts are coming  to my head.  I'm just like taking a moment.  I'm sitting on some of the, the, the, the, the, the, the cases or whatever backstage.  And Pete sits next to me and goes, wow, the show's doing real well and stuff. 
[02:47:00]  I'm like, yeah, you know.  And all of a sudden I go, yeah, it's my dad's birthday today.  And he goes, oh, wow.  Cool.  How old is he?  Oh, no.  And I go.  Oh, no.  It was obvious.  The only reason I said that was because it was obvious I was kind of having a moment.  Yeah.  So I thought he knew.  So I go, yeah, it's my dad's birthday.  I'm kind of going.  I didn't say going through a thing right now.  I just said, yeah, it's my dad's birthday.  You know.  He goes, yeah, how old is he going to be?  How old is he today?  I'm like, he's dead. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, he's dead.  Right away.  Pete's like, how do you come back from that one?  It's like, but that's how sick I am because I could have let him off easy.  But I'm like, he's dead.  I'll let him off easy.  Yeah.  Just say the age without going into anything.  Or something.  I could have done something.  How old he would have been.  You know, how old would he be if he didn't die?  Yeah, you mean.  All right.  A couple of things. 
[02:48:00]  We've got Gary Goldman.  He's playing Gotham tonight.  Also, we've got to find a Kenny Rogers song about baseball.  Playing all week, right?  Yeah.  All weekend.  Yeah.  Starting tonight.  Yeah.  There's a baseball song by Kenny Rogers.  Someone is suggesting we should play for you, Bobby, about being a really good baseball  player.  I don't know.  We're going to see.  Is it heartwarming?  Is it touching?  I don't know.  I think, you know, they're trying to get Bobby to cry today.  Oh, is it one of those?  I don't know.  We'll find out.  And then we've got the dude Jonah from Superbad coming in. 
[02:48:30]  Yes.  Coming in next.  So stay there.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Oh, what?  The guy at XM doesn't know he could hit the commercial?  No, get out of here, dude.  No, they need a cue.  Are you kidding?  Are we still on?  Tell them to go to commercials.  Go to fucking commercials.  How obvious do you need it?  The virus is spreading.  Ah.  Lots of fun today, man.  Gary Goldman in studio playing Gotham all weekend long. 
[02:49:00]  There he is.  Jonah.  What's up, buddy?  There he is.  How are you, sir?  How are you doing, man?  How are you doing?  Welcome to the clubhouse, I guess.  How's it going?  I don't know where to go.  Just find a mic, plop down, and start yapping.  Just talk in the middle of the room and project.  Well, we're distracted there, Jonah, because Regis is here.  Yeah.  That's not Regis in the dunk tank.  He's attempting, some dude is attempting to break the underwater not breathing record. 
[02:49:30]  Live on Regis.  You think he's going to do it?  What is it?  It's 14 minutes and 25.  Yeah, oh, fucking A.  I kind of feel like I don't give a shit how long someone's going to do it.  It's like, great, you can sit in water and do nothing.  See, Jonah, you fit in with us, because we're thinking if we're like Regis at this moment,  like, what do you say?  You want Kelly Ripa to just show snatch to the guy right before he's going to break the record  and just watch him go. 
[02:50:00]  Like fucking Matt Hooper in the cage.  If the guy who had the record just jumped in the tank and mouthfucked him right before  he got the record.  I like Regis just staring at him.  Once I had to hold my breath for two minutes when I ate out John.  That pussy stinks.  That's tough when you go down on a brook.  So you can't curse on this show?  Oh, it's everything.  Watch.  Cunt.  See?  Pretty much the A-bomb. 
[02:50:30]  It's the A-bomb of words, and we can say it.  The C-word, man.  Is this a...  I don't have the C-word in my household.  Oh, yeah.  You got to watch that.  Maybe this guy's just a mannequin.  Maybe he's dead.  That would be great.  If he just died in there.  Can you imagine they finally have to check on him?  Just fucking...  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, man.  He's just taking the watch.  He just broke it.  Mariner.  He did it?  He did it?  Oh, he broke the record.  But he's going to stay in there a little longer?  Of course, I would.  Now he's doing the...  I'm holding my breath cheeks.  Do you remember when David Blaine tried to hold his breath for a really long time? 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  And then he stayed in the tank for a week before he did it?  Yeah.  But I didn't care about the week before.  He should have done one thing or the other thing.  Because now this dude just came and did what he tried to do on Reage.  Yeah.  And David Blaine's fucked now because he tried to stay in the tank for a long time and hold  his breath.  But if he had just broken the hold your breath record, people would have been psyched, I  feel like.  Absolutely.  Well, David Blaine's a hack.  We talk about him all the time. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, do you really?  Yeah, he's a joke.  That's the only thing I've seen.  And then I saw the thing in London when he just kind of hung out.  Hung out in a glass box above some box.  Who cares?  Some dumb thing.  Wow, that guy just broke the fucking record and who cares?  On Regis' show.  Wouldn't it be uncomfortable if you're driving with this guy and you accidentally end up  in a lake because he'd be like all relaxed and you'd be panicking and he'd just be like,  That's all right.  Wait till we hit bottom.  Yeah.  I like this song.  I'm just working out.  Yeah, no biggie. 
[02:52:00]  Don't worry about me.  I'm fine.  It puts on the wipers and laughs at you as you're just panicking trying to break the window.  All right.  He'd say, Don't panic.  They'd say, Oh, wait.  No, sorry.  I was going to say that to myself because I don't have to panic.  You should probably panic.  Yeah.  Give me 14 minutes and we'll be out of this.  Excuse me.  I'll be out of this.  Sorry.  I'll be out of this.  You're going to have guppies plucking your eyes out as your hair slowly goes with the  current of that eerie scene.  Hey, we got Jonah Hill, obviously, at studio from Superbad.  Sorry for the distraction.  Superbad.  Oh, no problem. 
[02:52:30]  That's more exciting.  A lot of us saw Superbad and absolutely loved the movie.  Oh, thanks, man.  And we had your two partners in here yesterday.  Oh, you had Michael and McLovin in here yesterday?  Yeah, yeah.  McLovin.  Even I've started calling him McLovin and I know him pretty well.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's impossible not to.  It's feverish.  It's McLovin fever is catching on.  Some dude at the airport, I was walking down and he was like, Hey, where's McLovin?  The movie hasn't even come out yet. 
[02:53:00]  I was like, How do you even know that?  I was like, All right.  Dude, yeah, he doesn't understand.  I saw you do stand-up one time.  Oh, really?  Yeah, you were great, man.  Thanks, bro.  That's Bob Kelly.  Yeah, Bob Kelly.  I've seen you do stand-up before, man.  It'd be funny if he just said that, Not you.  Oh, no, sorry.  I was on TV's on behind you.  No, you don't understand.  That happened to him.  That happened.  Tell the story.  It was even more embarrassing.  I saw you do stand-up and you were great.  Well, yeah, I was actually talking.  I thought me and Seinfeld became friends because he said like a word to me.  Yeah.  And we were, you know, I came back the next night and I was basically, Yo, man, hey, how 
[02:53:30]  you doing?  And he kind of blew me off a little bit.  Yeah.  But then he walked away two steps and he turned around and he goes, Look, when you're done,  come up and we'll hang out and we'll talk.  We'll, you know, I got some stories to tell you and we'll talk.  Jerry Seinfeld?  Yeah.  And he's like, We'll have some food.  And I was like, Dude, I'm in.  I'm going to do my set.  I'll be right up.  We'll hang out.  I got a story to tell you too.  And he looked right at me.  He goes, Not you.  Who is he talking to?  Someone right behind him.  He's next to me.  How embarrassing is that?  Dude, you think Seinfeld's like, Hey, come on up. 
[02:54:00]  You feeling all good about yourself?  And he goes in that Seinfeld way, Not you.  Not you.  That's embarrassing.  I went for like, That's why I stopped high-fiving people.  Because I saw like, I saw a dude who like, was going for a high-five and I like, assumed  it was for me for some reason and I put my hand up.  And then he went, like, he saw my hand and could have given me like, a courtesy high-five  because he knew I was going to look like a fucking asshole and he went around my hand 
[02:54:30]  and high-fived his friend and I just stood there.  Oh, man.  And I was like, Man, I'm not going to high-five even close friends.  When that happens, I just do the robot.  Like I was doing it.  I just do the robot.  There's no situation, even if you connect a high-five with someone, you look like an  idiot pretty much anyways.  Yeah.  So I figure like, fuck that.  It's just a setup to embarrass myself, I feel like.  The high-five is the, I actually made Anthony give me a high-five at the Detroit show.  On stage. 
[02:55:00]  And they actually were giving you shit, but the person who initiates the high-five is the  asshole.  You were pretty douchey on that one.  Because it's very addictive.  You cannot not give a high-five back.  If someone puts their hand up, you got to kind of, you can't leave them hanging.  No, totally.  I actually have a crazy story.  You guys want to hear a two-second story about this?  I used to live in New York and my landlord, Carl, was this like, kind of like big Italian  dude and he never wore a shirt even if it was like two degrees outside.  He was from Queens.  And he would be like, like, he was like, all right.  And then the first day I moved in, like, from that day on, after the first day, every 
[02:55:30]  time I'd see, he'd see me or one of my friends walk into the building, he would go, hey, look  at these high-fiving faggots.  Every time we walked in, right?  And I'd be like, every time.  Like, he would just call me that.  And I'd be like, what the fuck, man?  Like, what's Carl's deal?  Like, why does he call me that all the time?  So, the year was up and I was moving out and I was like, moving all my shit out and  I was like, hey, Carl, like, nice, you know, thanks for letting us live here.  You're a good landlord, you know.  I got to ask you, like, why, like, you know, like, why did you always call us, like, high-fiving 
[02:56:00]  faggots?  Like, we just, like, want to know.  And he's like, he's like, quiet for a second.  He's, you know, not wearing a shirt, obviously.  And he's like, he's like, you know, when I saw you move in here, I saw you high-five  one of your buddies.  That's what they call us.  That's it?  For a year.  For a whole year.  High-five and I was a high-fiving faggot for a whole time.  And then he said it in a way, like, he was bummed that he wasn't a part of our group  of friends.  Like, he felt, like, excluded.  Like, he would have wanted us to be like, hey, Carl, we're going to have a beer. 
[02:56:30]  You should come out.  And I feel like he said it with such resentment every time.  Like, yeah, I don't care about you guys, but really he did.  He was hurt.  Wow.  He had trouble showing his feelings, I think.  Great name for a band, the high-fiving faggots.  It's true.  It's a crazy term to use.  You ever get the, this is embarrassing, too.  When somebody waves and says, hey, how you doing?  And you think it's for you.  So you kind of wave back.  Oh, man.  And then you see someone come from behind you and go up to them and go, yeah, good.  How you been?  And you know the person saw you wave back to them. 
[02:57:00]  All greetings in general are designed to make you look like an asshole.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Nothing good comes from them.  If someone specifically walks up to you and looks you in the eyes and says, your name,  how are you?  That's the only time I'm going to say anything, Jack.  Because, or else, I always think that people are talking to me and they're definitely not.  Like, everywhere I go.  Yeah, how you doing?  I don't know what that is.  I have a bad, I have a bad problem with that.  How are you doing?  What's up?  How was Michael yesterday?  Did you guys have fun with Michael?  Well, I wanted to jump in here. 
[02:57:30]  We felt kind of dirty after the interview because we have this pal talk thing that maybe could  show you real fast.  Oh, yeah.  And they're leaving.  We're taking pictures.  It went well.  We promoted super bad like crazy.  And all of a sudden, those guys saw what was going on with these pal talk cameras.  And we had to explain it to them.  And then I think McLovin wanted to see cock.  Well, I was talking about how the Jackers end up on this.  See, we got nice girls on here that will show.  Is that a dude sleeping?  Show their titties.  That's a chick. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, she's got very nice boobies.  Fly benefits.  Wake up.  Yeah, that's a friend of yours.  Is she asleep right now?  Flight benefits.  Wake up.  See, we do a different type of show, Jonah.  We got people that are on their cams watching and listening to our show because we got cameras  up in the studio.  All right.  We have a special guest in the studio.  Can we see your boobies?  See, and this is flight benefits.  She's just waking up, which probably means we're boring her to death.  Go back to sleep.  No, no, no. 
[02:58:30]  She's tired.  No, we got to show you something here.  Yeah.  So, there she is.  She's topless.  Yeah.  I love her.  Hi.  Does she work for the show?  No.  No, she's just a fan.  She's just a fan listening and being naked.  See, we have cameras, and they have cameras at home, and we just, like, check in every so  often, and people do things.  But the bad thing is, with the nude women, you get what we call jackers.  They're usually Arab guys.  I don't know why, but they get in the room, and they focus the camera between their knees 
[02:59:00]  and their gut, and start just jerking off.  Wow.  And we found one yesterday.  Well, because McLovin said, hey, you know, I want to see one of those.  He goes, let me see one of those.  He wanted to see one of those.  Yeah, right?  That's what I'm getting at.  So, we pop one up, and this guy's just pounding.  He's pounding.  And then it ended up where he had his champagne bottle up his ass.  No.  Yeah.  It was.  It got really nasty.  But we felt like we were, I don't know.  Like, I know they're of age, but they look like, they look a lot younger than you.  Yeah, they look really young.  The dude's jacking off? 
[02:59:30]  He was jacking off, and they were not.  Oh, no.  Chris and Michael.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, Chris just turned 18.  Yeah.  It was like you're waiting for Chris Hansen to walk in and give you the old.  Well, I said Michael should do a guest spot on Dateline.  Yeah, Dateline Predator.  He should do, like, a guest star as the kid.  Yeah.  You know, like, hey, I'll be right there.  I'm just getting out of the shower.  Starring from Superman.  We got some cookies and lemonade.  I got a change, but I'll be right back.  Did you bring the alcohol?  Did you bring the vodka?  Condoms?  You brought condoms with you. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  So, did you guys see the movie?  I saw the movie.  I thought it was excellent, man.  Absolutely.  We did some kind of screening, and, man, laughs from beginning to end.  Awesome, man.  Thanks.  And I got to tell you something about you.  You were in 40-year-old version, but barely.  Little part.  Tiny part.  And then you were in Knocked Up, Tiny Part.  And I remember thinking at the time, I'm like, I want to see more of this guy.  There was something about you.  And then when I went and saw Superbad, and you're like the star of the movie there, I  was like, all right.  I was waiting.  And you didn't disappoint, man.  You were hilarious. 
[03:00:30]  Thanks, man.  I really appreciate that.  We don't want to give too much of the movie away, but it's one of these high school,  you know, you guys are going off to college, and you want to get some shit done  before you guys all separate.  Right.  You know what I mean?  You know, we like movies like Days to Confuse and Fast Times and shit like that.  And it's not a shit...  Like, I hate teen movies.  That's the one thing I always just try and say is I go out of my way not to see them  because they usually just suck.  And this one is dirty as fuck and has a lot of heart.  And it's like Virgin or Knocked Up. 
[03:01:00]  It's all made by the same dudes.  Whatever.  I'm going to stop plugging this bullshit.  Please go see it.  It's fucking awesome, I think.  I'll probably lie to you in a couple months and be like, hey, this movie's great.  It'll suck.  No, I...  But this movie for real, I think, is awesome.  Like, you should see it.  No, no.  His next movie.  Yeah.  This one's good, too.  Yeah.  No, it's really great, you know.  If you liked.  I thought it was...  I'm in, like, Boner Party 2.  Fucking boobie school for it. 
[03:01:30]  I'll tell you it's great, but this one, I'm not bullshit.  I thought it was funnier than Knocked Up.  And then people are like, hey, dude, it's the same people making both movies.  I'm like, well, I'm giving them a reference point.  I like Knocked Up, but this one is funnier.  I was bothered by Knocked Up because what's-her-name wouldn't show us her tits.  Oh, man.  She was, like, doing all those sex scenes.  It's a movie called Knocked Up, and she's doing all the scenes with her bra, and that took  me out of the movie.  That was the one thing great.  And people thought I was crazy for bringing that up.  I want my girls topless if they're having sex in movies.  Yeah, back in the day, they'd always show a boobie.  Thank you, yes.  Oh, yeah.  With Phoebe Cates. 
[03:02:00]  I mean, how many times did you stop?  That was great.  And that was back when you had VHS.  Didn't anyone fucking knock anymore?  Yeah.  You guys are bummed, probably, though, because we had to cut out the Chris jerking off with  the champagne bottle.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Damn.  Unfortunately, we had to cut that for time, but not because of content.  And, you know, without giving too much away, the penis montage thing.  Oh, thanks, man.  You're going to get people talking.  Actually, some of that is already on YouTube, but then they get rid of it real fast.  Yeah, they're scanning that shit. 
[03:02:30]  Get it off.  Oh, yeah, it's funny.  Oh, stay to the end.  It's one of these movies.  They do some good stuff with the credits.  Oh, stay through the credits.  Yeah, stay through the credits.  Yeah.  Stay through the credits.  Please.  Go see it.  Pay to go see it.  Then stay through the credits.  Yeah.  The movie's got a great buzz.  You don't even have to be here.  Oh, man.  It's a pleasure to be here.  I remember when you guys came on the air, man.  I was like, I remember how offended people were about you guys.  And I listened.  I was like, man, this shit is awesome. 
[03:03:00]  I love this shit.  Yeah.  I don't want to make you guys feel old, but I was pretty young at the time.  Yeah.  We realize.  That happens.  I was only 41 at the time.  My second wife.  Hey, do you have an OJ story I'm hearing?  Yeah.  Did he cockwalk you or something?  What's funny is I told it on, I was on the Tonight Show, which was really exciting and  cool.  And I was just like, you know, I've been getting to do all these talk shows.  I was on Conan last night, which was awesome.  And, you know, but since it's the first time I'm starring in a movie, they let you go on 
[03:03:30]  all the talk shows and shit.  So I had to separate all the stories from my entire life, like trying to think of a new  story for each one or think of all the shit that's happened to you ever.  And so we went on this tour and I was like, oh, this was something funny that happened.  We went on this press tour, me, Michael and Chris.  And we were in Miami.  And I don't like going to nightclubs and shit like that.  I like going to like a dive bar, hanging out with my friends.  But we were just exhausted.  And there was this cool bar.  Someone was like, hey, we arranged for you guys to go to like a nightclub, you know, 
[03:04:00]  not Michael and Chris, because they're underage, which they're under 20 a lot.  So they couldn't have any fun.  But I went with some friends and we went and it was like crazy.  It was like too crazy for me.  I couldn't handle it.  But this girl comes up and starts talking to me.  She's like, oh, man, I love Knocked Up.  I thought you were really funny.  And she's really cute.  She's really cute.  And I don't have a girlfriend.  So I was like, oh, cool.  Thanks.  This is awesome, man.  I'm going to maybe like hook up with this girl or something like that or whatever, dance 
[03:04:30]  with her, whatever the fuck people do in nightclubs.  I don't know.  I was like, how does this work?  I have no idea.  And she was like, you know, she was like really flirtatious with me.  And then all of a sudden, like OJ walks by and I was like, fuck, man, it's OJ like right  there.  That dude just hangs out in nightclubs.  And then like she like looks at OJ and then looks back at me and she's like, peace.  And then starts go dancing with OJ.  Oh, man.  OJ blocked me, dude.  He cock blocked me.  Fuck her, man.  Fuck him. 
[03:05:00]  That dude should not be out stealing chicks from other people.  What chick would like go to OJ?  That's what I was saying, man.  He's magic.  He's famous for killing somebody.  For killing people.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Unless you're older and he's famous for playing football, by the way.  I think the killing overshadows the football.  And then I talked to one of her friends.  I said, do you know what OJ is famous for?  She's like, yeah, killing somebody.  Anything else?  And she's like, no. 
[03:05:30]  She had no idea she was a football player.  There's something called the Heisman Trophy and all that things.  He's like the greatest, one of the greatest college football players ever, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he killed people.  Yeah.  I feel like that all turns to shit once you murder somebody.  How does it make a chick hot, though?  It's like, you know, this guy yelling up and coming actors in a few flicks that you love,  and then a murderer walks by and your vagina gets wet.  How does that happen?  She must have really wanted to get back at her father.  Like, really badly. 
[03:06:00]  Dude, if you want to get back at your father, that is the absolute...  You win.  Yeah.  There's nothing higher than calling your dad and being like,  Dad, remember when you, like, wouldn't fucking let me go out with Timmy fucking Ronson?  Well, guess what?  I fucked O.J. last night.  It was, like, the craziest thing you could ever do to your dad.  Yeah, he held a dull blade to my neck.  Well, guess what?  I fucked O.J.  O.J. Simpson.  Hey, uh... 
[03:06:30]  Is there another O.J. Simpson?  It's actually THE O.J.'s.  Were you saying on Kona last night that you've been hiding behind the super bad cardboard?  Cutouts in movie theaters?  Yeah, I jump out behind them.  Well, I figure, like, every, like, EU actors and shit, and they're so jaded, and they're,  like, too cool to, like...  I mean, I don't fucking know, man.  It's my first time I'm starting a movie.  I'm on a poster that's, like, all over the place.  Like, I'm just enjoying...  I feel lucky, and I'm enjoying it.  Yeah, man.  I'm doing funny shit with it.  Like, why would...  Like, I mean, like... 
[03:07:00]  I could walk by and be like, oh, cool, there's, like, a poster.  I mean, fuck it.  I don't care, you know?  But, like, I'm like, man, I'm gonna fucking scare the shit out of these 16-year-olds right  now.  I sit behind it, I wait, and I just go, hey!  And they fucking...  Their minds are so blown.  Imagine staring at a sign of something, and it popping out behind the sign.  And then I start and cut it, and I cut a hole in the sign and put my penis through the hole.  Because I was telling this story about how...  Out of context, that sounds really strange and weird, but I was... 
[03:07:30]  I told this story about how, like, I was doing a movie, and I was taking a nap, and someone  who worked on the movie knocked on the door of my trailer, and I woke up, and I was like,  she's looking at me, like, all weird and shit, like, what the fuck?  And I go back, and I'm still, like, asleep.  I'm like, all right, thanks.  First you're coming by.  And I go up by my mirror, and my penis is completely through the hole in my boxers.  And she was just, like, eye-level with it.  Oh, fuck!  Eye to eyes, is what I said.  And then, so Conan was like, where's your penis during all this?  And I was like, I cut a hole in the boaster. 
[03:08:00]  That dude is cool as shit, man.  Yeah, Conan?  Fuck, yeah, man.  Yeah, I don't think he knows we're alive.  No, Conan?  Yeah.  He is, like, he's my favorite talk show host, I'd say.  Like, that's the show I watch, like, every night, always.  Yeah, maybe one of these days.  Yeah.  We did the Letterman.  Letterman?  And then we did the Leno.  What'd you think?  Yeah.  Did you have fun?  Yeah, it was definitely a blast.  It was the first one of the, you know, the big shows.  So, like, you're standing there, you're standing in that little, like, area where you wait, 
[03:08:30]  and you're just going, how the fuck did this happen?  Yeah.  It's like, how am I walking out on this stage, you know?  It's crazy, man.  Yeah, that's, like, the most nervous I ever am, for sure.  Beforehand, you're in the dressing room, you want to throw up, you're just like, oh,  I can't do this.  And then, right before you walk out, you're just, like, behind the curtain, and you're  like, I'm going to fuck, I'm just going to take off.  Yeah.  I'm just going to leave.  This is fun.  Yeah, I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I can't do this.  I've fucked up my whole life right now.  I'm going to go out there and say some shit I shouldn't say.  And then what happens?  Like, they announce you, music starts, and you walk out, like, hey, look at me. 
[03:09:00]  I always wave like such an idiot when I...  Yeah, the stupid wave.  I look like such a dumb fuck when I walk out there, always.  I'm always like, hey.  And I'm, like, smiling really big.  Why do you feel compelled to wave like that to the audience?  Who the fuck am I waving to?  Like, fucking Clooney doesn't wave when he comes out.  At least I don't walk out there.  He struts out there and sits down.  Clooney, like, just, yeah, he's saying, hey, I'm fucking, I'm cool, I don't need to  wave like an idiot.  Dopey wave to the audience. 
[03:09:30]  At least I didn't go for a high five for the audience.  High five the audience.  You should just bow.  You should just take a three, like, three bows.  One to the left, one to the second, one to the right.  I saw Shia LaBeouf on a talk show, and I actually thought he had a good move, because  I always feel awkward, like, when you walk out and wave and shit.  And Shia LaBeouf would, he just clapped when he walked out, and I thought that was a  really good move.  I was like, you're not awkward.  Yeah, but you're not, like, you're not too cool, you're not not waving to anybody,  or you're not, like, me and waving like a fucking idiot. 
[03:10:00]  And then he's just like, all right, I'm clapping for himself.  You're clapping, and I'm clapping for you guys, you're clapping for me.  That's how I took it.  I was like, that's kind of a cool idea.  As long as you can translate that, like, you're clapping for the audience.  Almost, like, aim the clap at them.  You know, you kind of turn and go, no, for you, this is for you guys.  Put a hand out there.  Yeah, yeah, something like that.  That might be cool.  But if you're clapping for yourself, and don't, like, be the last guy.  Like, the audience stops, and you're still clapping for you.  You're still standing.  And then give a dumb wave, anyway. 
[03:10:30]  Oops, shit, I gave one.  Hey, you know what, I don't know if, uh, do you have time?  How much time does he have, Jonah?  I know he's a big star.  Five minutes!  Five minutes!  Where are you going next, Jonah?  Yeah, what do you got?  I don't know.  Regis.  Have you done Regis?  No, we did the Today Show yesterday.  That's pretty cool.  That was scary as shit, man.  That was the scariest one.  Yeah?  Because those people, not only don't know who I am, could not give a fuck if I knew that.  Like, the people, like, the surrounding people.  Yeah.  And they told us, like, me and Michael, Chris, they were like, they're like, all right, the 
[03:11:00]  crowd's gonna go crazy when you guys walk out, because he was, like, outside.  We walk outside, and you could, like, audibly hear people, like, who the fuck are you?  Oh, God damn.  Like, where's the woman who makes roses out of origami paper?  Or, like, super bad, these people are, like, 60 years old from, like, you know, oh, that's  wrong.  They haven't seen a movie in theaters in, like, since, like, uh, Gone with the Wind?  Schindler's List was, like, the last movie any of these people saw. 
[03:11:30]  Actually, not even.  Glory.  They were actually in it.  They were in Schindler's List.  Dude, I love your honesty, man.  You're so right.  They'll never see the movie.  They don't give a shit.  Yeah, well, I mean, hopefully, like, the goal is, like, a few people watching go, oh, maybe  that's a funny movie.  They just know it's important for their lower demo.  I was like, we did a whole bit today.  Larry King interviewed that skater that fell 50 feet.  Oh, man.  How cool was that?  That is the craziest video I've ever seen.  And Larry King interviewing this guy was radio gold, how out of touch he was with this  skater dude.  Oh, just because, yeah, he's trying to connect.  He actually asked, how important is the board in skateboarding? 
[03:12:00]  He's just talking to the skateboarder.  He's like, how important is the board?  And the guy's just like, well, the board's, you know, important.  The wheels, the shoes.  He didn't know what to say to the guy.  Yeah.  The guy's just babbling.  Ah, so you fell.  See, I don't mind.  We've done so, like, just a tour for the past month, just, like, so many interviews.  You get interviewed by some people that are, like, way older than you.  And the ones you like are the ones that don't desperately try and be, like, your age or 
[03:12:30]  connect with being your age, you know what I mean?  And the ones that are, like, you could, they're cool if they're just, like, genuinely interested  and they're asking questions that have shit they don't know about, you know?  But, like, the ones that are, like, so, we all like to go out and draw dicks and shit.  They're, like, 60 years old and they're, like, you know, like, you know, like, it's,  like, when I'm older, I'm going to make a conscious decision to be, like, I'm not going  to try and be like you.  I'm just going to try and understand you and, like, and ask appropriate questions, you 
[03:13:00]  know?  Like, I'm not going to try and be the dude who's, like, wears the same shit as my kids.  Like, wears the same clothes and shit like that.  That's the fucking Larry King thing.  So it's, like, and that, and Regis will do that, too, though.  Yeah.  He'll, like, you know, we got P. Diddy coming out.  P. Diddy.  So I want some bling.  It's, like, no, take the bling off, asshole.  Here's to Larry King.  It's really quick.  Yeah, yeah.  Boy, that's pretty great stuff.  Yeah.  How important is the board? 
[03:13:30]  Ha!  Uh, the board's one of the main things.  The board, the shoes.  That's one of the wheels.  The wheels.  Shoes.  It all comes into play.  You want, you want to feel comfortable with your entire setup.  How is it, how important is the board?  The board's, uh, pretty, pretty important.  I had to say it's pretty important.  There's a lot of the wheels and the shoes.  How important is, how important is that microphone in this job?  That's what we said.  That's what we said, man.  Well, let me see.  It's pretty, I guess.  Holy shit, it isn't.  That was a stupid question. 
[03:14:00]  Now, this came up yesterday, but I don't know if we have enough time, but the Lily Tomlin  thing from iHeart Huckabee.  Oh, that got huge, man.  Yeah, I, you know, it's funny, like everyone, that was my first movie, that movie, and, uh,  I love all those people, man.  I love David, the director, and all those people were super cool.  I never saw anything that strange go on.  I must have not been there.  I was only in a little part, but.  That's such an odd thing to watch, some people just losing their shit.  The video's crazy to watch, yeah.  But, you know, like, I've never had any sort of experience like that with David or any of  those.  We just love playing the audio. 
[03:14:30]  It's hilarious.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's XM.  It's XM, you can get away with the C-word and everything else.  We just made one of those on the, it just leaked last night.  What was it?  Uh, Michael and I at the Press Junket got interviewed by our friend Edgar Wright, who  directed Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead, and, uh, it's, it looks completely real, like  people think it's real on the internet.  It leaked last night.  Look up, uh, Superbad, like, Meltdown, Superbad Junket Meltdown, or something like  that.  And it's like, he's coming to me, and he's like, Jonah, do you have to be, he's English, 
[03:15:00]  he's like, do you have to be unattractive to be funny?  And, like, all these things, and he's like, we wrote him all these questions.  He's, like, the nicest guy.  He didn't want to say any of the mean shit, and I was like, just say it.  And, like, eventually I just fucking freak out and, like, hit him.  And, like, it looks completely, it's, like, looks, people think it's real on the internet,  and that's, like, exactly what we wanted, is people just think it's completely real.  Well, now they're going to know it's fake.  No.  No?  Nah, who's listening to this?  Who's listening to this shit?  Come on.  Fuck, yeah.  Let's see if it's real.  I should have said that.  Well, all right, if you guys are listening, don't fucking tell your co-workers. 
[03:15:30]  I know this feels like we're just hanging out in a bar, but people are listening to this show.  I didn't mean to have it disrespectful.  That's actually a compliment to the radio.  No, sorry, you five guys, you five guys, like, don't tell your co-workers.  Be cool, man.  So what the greatest compliment is, we'll be doing an interview, like, with someone like you,  or whatever, and halfway through they'll go, are we on the radio?  It feels, it's so great.  You guys create a really great environment of, like, hanging out, as opposed to feeling  like, when you're on, like, a radio show, most of these, you're just like, oh, I'm fuck, 
[03:16:00]  right.  Yeah.  I'm on a radio show.  They ask the same question.  Yeah.  Like, you got to try to make the answer sound new, even though it's, like, the same fucking  question.  Well, you know what?  I guess anyone can be super bad, really, if you are.  Super bad is just, like, a state of mind, you know?  It's just, like, being cool and being yourself, you know?  Dude, we have a lot of comedian friends, obviously, like Bob Kelly, and they come back from the  road, and they'll give us all the horror stories of doing other radio shows, where the guy 
[03:16:30]  has his normal voice, like, so, we're going to get you in in a little while, and talk about  super bad, and then it's like, ha, ha, ha, in the studio.  Oh, my God.  That's what the wacky horn's for.  I was supposed to do a call-in to another radio show.  I just...  Today?  You just forgot.  Do it on the air, right now.  Can I tell you?  Actually, Wolf, the Wolf.  Oh, the Wolf up there in Mohamed Hassan.  When I saw Bob do stand-up at Beecher's Comedy Madhouse a few years ago.  That was Las Vegas.  Yeah, and that was, like, a couple years ago.  That's a fucking hell year.  And you were great. 
[03:17:00]  You were, like, you brought down the house.  Yeah.  I remember, I can't remember specifically one thing you did, but, like, no, that sounded  the opposite of what I was saying.  You're acting be memorable.  I remember specifically there was something where you were doing a really funny dance.  Was there a bit you used to do where you used to have, like, a really funny...  Like, you were talking about dancing at a club or something like that, and then, like,  this really funny, like, hip-hop song came on, and you were, like...  Dude, I remember specifically...  No, that was actually an Asian guy.  That was the Asian guy, Steve Burns.  Oh, no.  No, it wasn't.  I specifically remember.  I swear to God, I have no dance... 
[03:17:30]  Look at me.  Huh?  Look at me.  But you were doing an impression of, like, someone dancing, like, I don't know.  I've seen your moves look very dance-like.  I remember specifically, because I remember...  Maybe, dude.  I don't know.  Maybe I was just doing something that night, but that show, just to let you know, was...  It was like...  There was movie stars, like, Paris Hilton would be there, and, you know, guys like you  would be...  All these people from LA would show...  Yeah, movie stars, and the first person you pull out is Paris Hilton.  Dude, I was...  This was like...  True.  She's more fucking popular than me.  Let's put it that way. 
[03:18:00]  And I...  He does that dance on the receiving end of Glory Holes.  That's...  Okay, hold on.  Oh, that's her.  I'll crash myself.  That was hurtful.  We're all having fun.  You know why it's such that you laugh before we laugh.  Right.  And then you did a little move.  I'm not afraid to lob them out there.  Sometimes they don't hit.  It's fine.  I'm feeling a weird tension here.  I was trying to give Bob a compliment, because he was really funny.  But you were really funny.  That was the point of the story.  I remember laughing my ass off. 
[03:18:30]  And that show's crazy.  There's like, you know, like...  It's like a circus show, also.  I had to follow a seven-foot Russian gay sword swallower.  That would get a standing O every time.  The place would flip out.  Oh, and then you have to follow that.  And it's like, you know...  You remember the hard rock?  Well, that's the rule.  It's like for Manny Hall.  You don't put two sword swallowers in a row on the same bill.  Just call me a homie.  He's not just kidding.  Actually, you know what?  I realized that sounded like I was calling you gay, but I was making a joke like you 
[03:19:00]  both did the same act, like swallowed swords.  No, I got that.  It was actually funny the other way.  I know.  And pretty accurate.  But you insulted him.  I wish I was gay.  There have been some episodes.  I'd fucking blow him for a part in his next movie.  Now it is uncomfortable.  Now it really is.  Well, I was going to just be quiet for a second.  So, yeah, so...  Well, you know... 
[03:19:30]  But seriously, you know...  Actually considering it?  I'll drag a moment like that on for like 15, 20 minutes.  All right, you got to get to your next thing.  Look, she's nodding over there.  You didn't laugh once, by the way.  You're bored.  She laughed her ass off.  You laughed a little over there, Pizzy.  She's a silent laugher.  Yeah, because you're on the radio.  Respectful.  All right.  Dude, you guys are awesome.  Thank you so much for having me on.  Jonah, let me tell you something.  Thanks for coming in.  Superbad's going to be a hit, brother.  It's going to be a big star.  It's going to be a huge hit.  And we'll never see you again because you're going to blow up. 
[03:20:00]  Well, obviously, yeah.  No, no, I'm not coming back.  I can imagine you would.  Anytime you guys let me back, I'd love to come back.  Anytime you're in New York, we have an open door policy.  You just call or just show up.  Awesome, man.  I'll be here.  We have a long list of people that just come and hang because they like the show.  But seriously, Superbad's going to be huge.  It's a week from Friday.  It opens, right?  Yeah, August 17th.  And we're on the cover of Entertainment Weekly.  Me and Michael came out today, I guess.  That's cool.  I haven't even seen it yet.  Isn't that a bitch?  It's only for a week.  Yeah, I know.  I literally wish I could make this week go by in the slowest time frame ever on the planet. 
[03:20:30]  If I had a machine that could do that.  That's great, man.  That's all.  Entertainment Weekly.  You did Conan last night, and I'm going to be doing the Mohegan Sun.  My career sucks.  Bob's on the cover of the Mohegan Sun daily.  He's on the program.  I am on the program.  Are you really?  I'll go see it at the Mohegan Sun.  Fuck it.  Let's do it.  Trust us on this one.  Jonah Hill is going to be massive in Hollywood.  Oh, man.  Dude, you're going to be massive.  You got that.  You just got it. 
[03:21:00]  Thanks, man.  I appreciate it.  It comes across nicely on screen, man.  I don't know what it is.  We all laughed our asses off, like I said, from beginning to end.  And we said, funnier than Knocked Up and funnier than any movie Adam Sandler's ever done.  That was my quote.  Wow, man.  Jonah.  Well, thank you for the compliment, guys.  It's Superbad.  Yo, I'm not going to, one more thing, Superbad August 17th, I'm not an asshole coming to  promote or whatever.  Please see the movie or I'll never do another movie ever again.  It's really funny, though, dude.  I wouldn't bullshit you.  Thanks for having me, guys.  No problem, man.  All right, cool. 
[03:21:30]  It's Jonah Hill.  You guys are rad.  Thanks.  Wave.  We'll be back in just a bit.  Thanks.  High five.  High five.  High five.  High five.  All around, man.  Yeah.  Hey, what's that?  You've never seen it before?  Looks like a rock.  New from Sedentary Toys and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, it's so shiny.  It's got corners.  It's the cool new toy that has everyone jumping for joy.  O&A Party Rock.  It's not just any rock.  It's the O&A Party Rock.  The O&A Party Rock is incredibly versatile.  You can chuck it.  You can fuck it.  You can drop it in a bucket. 
[03:22:00]  You can race it.  You can chase it.  You can yell right in its face.  It's the bestest friend you'll ever have.  O&A Party Rock.  Why is it wearing a party hat?  Every Party Rock comes dressed in a colorful party hat and party blower, making it the  centerpiece of any party.  Now with shiny red dancing shoes.  Not only that, the O&A Party Rock is...  is...  is...  It's the fucking rock, you dildo.  Man, that was a lot of fun. 
[03:22:30]  Jonah Hill from Superbad.  In theaters a week from Friday.  Someone said I look like an asshole because I brought up Adam Sandler.  And Jonah Hill had a small part in a movie that Adam Sandler produced or whatever.  Grandma's Boy.  So because of that, I guess I made an ass out of myself.  All right. 
[03:23:00]  Ah, well.  Whatever, Ben.  No, it's Ben in Midtown.  All right.  Gary Goldman in studio, playing Gotham all weekend long.  Did you have fun with that?  Yeah, I love Gotham Comedy Club.  It's a great club.  Well, it's great, Gary.  I love the first time a comedian comes on our show because he's...  I see you.  You're just trying to figure it all out.  You're just sitting back like, what the fuck is this?  Well, my fear was that I was coming into the scene in Goodfellas where Tommy thinks  he's getting made.  He's getting made.  And he's shooting in the back of the head and he's just like, oh, no. 
[03:23:30]  I see my friend Bob Kelly and you think Tootie Cicero isn't going to whack you.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden Bob Kelly is...  I've had nightmares of him making fun of me and just, how could you think they really  liked you?  You kind of think that Bob's going to kind of hold your hand through the first appearance.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's going to bring me in and we're making small talk.  How old were you when you first did Opium Anthem?  Oh, that was a long time ago.  Pike's Peak was just a pimple.  And I'm dead.  And the movie goes downhill from there.  Yeah.  We were talking about Bob Kelly during the break. 
[03:24:00]  Like, Jonah Hill, who's huge, he's going to be even huger in Hollywood after this movie  hits, is giving him a massive compliment about his comedy.  And I realized halfway through that Bob Kelly realized that he's talking about another  comedian.  And I'm like, Bob, why don't you just, like, say thank you?  Just say, yeah, thanks.  Because his father didn't play catch with him.  That's why he couldn't take a compliment.  He couldn't believe that anybody would actually like him for him.  Or it sounded...  Tragic.  Crazy.  But I...  Yeah, that kid...  You know, you guys are in your 30s, right?  Just...  Oh, yeah. 
[03:24:30]  What to...  Just made it into my 30s.  Yeah, to have that ahead of you.  What a...  Ugh, I want to...  I envy that kid.  God almighty.  It's going to be huge.  Huge.  And it's a great time in life to have...  You know, you're not Rodney Dangerfield doing your first movie at 58.  This kid at 21, and he's really...  Right?  21 or something like that?  Could go either way.  Could go either way.  Could be one and done.  He could be very successful, or he could get into...  Yeah, you don't want to be Horshack.  ...the dope.  Yeah. 
[03:25:00]  Horshack.  Yeah.  He could get into the dope.  No.  Be one of the Corys.  Not Jonah.  No?  Not my Jonah.  Got some faith in him.  It's not going to happen to Jonah.  That is funny.  Yeah.  He's a good kid.  A lot of people think Rodney Dangerfield was, like, you know, famous for his whole life.  I know.  His first movie, he was, like, 50-something.  Oh.  When he finally hit in Hollywood.  That's great.  Maury's got, like, kiddie porn on his show today.  Look at that.  There's some little girl dancing around trying to be provocative.  Oh, Maury.  Hey, think about it. 
[03:25:30]  Oh, God.  Think about it.  Ain't nothing you do that.  All right.  Nice ass.  They just panned up from her shoes to her, uh, head.  And there's Maury, like, just tapping his heels.  Yeah.  What an adorable girl full of talent.  Who will be the new Maury mini-idol?  Chris Hansen should come out.  No kidding, man.  Take fucking Maury away.  What are you doing here?  We're having a competition.  Talent competition.  Sure.  Let me get this transcript.  How does Connie even look at him with a straight face after this? 
[03:26:00]  She's a real newswoman, an icon, and Maury comes home.  Yeah, I had an 11-year-old singing, I guess, blues brothers.  Why would she even know that song, Think?  Aretha Frank Donald.  Yeah.  The observation with Maury, too, is that he got to that age where you shouldn't be dying  your hair anymore.  Nobody's buying it.  Like, a lot of people, you know, you get a little gray, you can cover it up, and no  one cares, and no one notices.  But then something happens.  All of a sudden, you hit that age, and you see these people walking around Manhattan,  and you're like, holy shit, dude. 
[03:26:30]  It's time to give up.  You know what it is?  I think the texture of the hair changes.  Is that what it is?  It physically changes, like, the texture of gray hair turns into, like, steel wool.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it's not soft like hair anymore, so when you color it, it just doesn't look right.  And you know what?  I think Maury's listening to us, because he's kind of a fan of the show.  Maury listens, yeah.  Only since we talked about how bad his dye job looks, I just noticed that there's a  little gray.  He's letting it grow out a little bit.  Maury, it's looking better.  All right, Maury, right about there.  Look at these creepy parents. 
[03:27:00]  They put a provocative picture of their 10-year-old daughter on their shirts that they're wearing.  And Ms. Linda Seftian.  Who's that?  Is that your teacher?  They're my singing teachers.  Your teachers, yeah.  You got this American Idol thing in the room.  Shut up.  Is that what you want to do?  Yeah.  I'm so afraid of Simon.  Really?  Yes.  You think he's for real?  Mm-hmm.  He's that mean?  Mm-hmm.  You're going to pose for Playboy someday?  Is that what you want to do?  Okay.  Yeah. 
[03:27:30]  I brought some Zima and condoms.  You like a little Kool-Aid with you, Zima?  Yeah.  What do you mean you'll be right back?  Give me that juicy box of yours.  I want to add a little something to it.  No, the beverage.  That's what I'm talking about.  The thing with the straw on the side.  Yeah, well, yeah.  Of course.  Yeah, you say.  Put it in context, asshole.  This is like half everyone knows what a juicy box is.  Of course it is.  Did all the pairs know where I was going?  You went the other way. 
[03:28:00]  Next, four-year-old burlesque dancers.  What do I sound like?  Larry.  Larry.  Larry King.  What the fuck?  If you see one movie this summer, make it Super Bads.  Super Bads.  The Super Bads.  I did not say Hot Rod was the funniest movie of the year just last week.  I have not seen Hot Rod.  We said it looked good.  The trailer looked good.  The reviews on the movie turned out to be awful.  Look, I didn't see it. 
[03:28:30]  I still haven't seen it, no.  Blame me.  I've been talking about Super Bads for the last week or so.  All right.  You know what?  We got the Huckabees thing.  I wanted to play it for Jonah.  Yeah.  But it sounded like he didn't want to go there, and he was so cool.  We didn't want to push with him.  Nah.  Some people will push with him.  If he does come back, then we'll really fuck with him.  Yeah, some people will push.  But he was way too cool.  But the I Heart Huckabees.  We haven't played this in a while, right?  Mm-hmm.  Lily Tomlin and David O. Russell have their respective blowouts on the set of I Heart Huckabees.  Have you seen this yet?  No.  Oh, my God. 
[03:29:00]  I never saw the movie either.  Anything with the heart Huckabees.  Well, this video is up everywhere, though.  You can see the actual video.  Yeah.  Lily Tomlin loses her fucking mind during the filming of this movie.  And take your legs off the desk and a whole bunch of other stuff.  Everybody says you've got to keep it, because you can take your legs down, too.  We could find you.  Okay.  For Christ's sake.  Let's just take it one fucking line at a time instead of changing everything.  It's very difficult to even create what you're going to do when it's constant, a barrage of 
[03:29:30]  change this, change this, do this, do this.  No, wait, wait.  Do it a different way.  Do it a different way.  Don't get me started.  Okay, so I'm just saying, let's just, you know, it's impossible.  One actor's doing one thing, another actor's doing another, and I'm not as brilliant as  you.  I can't keep up with you.  No, but we're being very efficient.  We're being very efficient?  We're being patient in here.  Let's rehearse.  You're being impatient.  No, I said patient.  Let's rehearse.  I couldn't understand you. 
[03:30:00]  No, it's not the first time.  They're just warming up, Gary.  Don't worry.  They're warming up.  That's great.  What I find funny about this is they're trying to film a comedy, and that's not a good climate  to get some funny stuff done.  Yeah, action.  Bring the funny.  Yeah.  This is where it gets good.  There's a scene where Lily's in a car, and she's sitting in the car with Dustin Hoffman.  Dustin Hoffman has to sit there and listen to this shit.  Leave me the fuck alone.  Do you know what the fuck is going on? 
[03:30:30]  Period.  Fuck you.  I've had it up to here.  Who's reacting to what, for God's sakes?  Fuck you, motherfucker.  One ringy dingy.  Isn't she supposed to be funny, one ringy dingy girl?  Or Edith Ann in the big chair?  Maybe she realizes it's true. 
[03:31:00]  Fuck you, motherfucker.  Never saw her pop out of a hatch door and laugh in and say that.  All right, someone saw it your way, Anthony.  Damn it, Opie.  For the love of God, I didn't think of a box of juice until Ann said straw.  All right.  Yeah.  The parents know what I'm talking about.  Trying to protect us here, Hendry.  Juicy box.  It's called juicy box.  Yeah.  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. 
[03:31:30]  Get the fucking thing together.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Oh, yeah.  Bullshit.  That's why we spent five or six fucking hours doing something else?  No!  God damn it!  You fucked it up, god damn you!  Now get straight on it and help.  If you can't help them, help me!  She doesn't improv well.  No.  That's right.  Fuck you, too. 
[03:32:00]  No, I'm not.  I'm sorry.  You don't get up.  Don't get up.  I'll break the fucking set apart.  I don't even give a fuck.  I got to know that because you're there.  Oh, shut up.  Shut the...  You shut the fuck up, too.  I will, but you're still there.  Shoot the fucking thing right now.  Yeah, let's...  Oh, yeah.  You'll get...  You'll get all this.  I'll be angry as she's angry.  That'll be good.  Dustin Hoffman.  Let's just shoot this.  Hoffman.  Yeah.  Yeah, Hoffman.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Excuse me.  Yeah, it's Dustin Hoffman.  Exactly.  Might have remembered...  You might remember a few movies he's done.  Yeah. 
[03:32:30]  And he's got to sit there just like any of us.  It wasn't the incredible shrinking woman where she walks around with giant props for the  whole movie.  I wonder why she doesn't work more.  Yeah, right?  Exactly.  It's like, well, she's supposed to be very brilliant and everything.  Why doesn't that girl work more?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Golly, amazing.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  She's just thankful for any morsel she can get at this point.  Yeah, I guess so.  She's appreciative.  She's very down to earth.  Yeah, she sounds it.  Oh, my God, Lily.  This last clip, the director gets back at her. 
[03:33:00]  This is the complete meltdown, yeah.  There's a set with doors and stuff, and the director just loses his mind.  He's had it with Lily Tomlin.  And you hear him like yelling at her, and then he goes through one door, so now you hear  him in the background.  Then he comes through another door and continues yelling at her.  Yeah, because it's a set.  He walks out a side door and then comes from behind the camera.  Fuck you.  I'm just trying to fucking help you.  Do you understand me?  No, no, no.  I'm being a fucking collaborator.  I'm just trying to help you figure out your fucking picture. 
[03:33:30]  Hey, bitch, I'm not here to be fucking yelled at.  I worked on this fucking thing for three fucking years.  I'm going to have some fucking cunt yell at me.  I'm going to fucking throw.  I'm trying to fucking help you, bitch.  Figure it out yourself.  Well, I have to do that.  Yeah, fuck yourself.  Fuck your whole movie.  Why don't you fuck your whole movie?  Because that's what you're doing.  We better get some insurance against the director.  You're a fucking grown-up. 
[03:34:00]  You're a fucking grown-up.  You're a fucking grown-up.  Act like a grown-up.  You're not a baby.  You're a fucking grown-up.  I'm here to fucking help you.  That's all I was doing was trying to help you figure out your business.  You're not yelling.  You're not yelling.  You're not yelling.  You're not yelling.  You're not yelling.  You're not yelling.  You're not yelling at me before right now.  No.  I never fucking yelled at you.  You fucking said it.  That's the yelling standard for the whole set. 
[03:34:30]  Oh, how great is that.  And you wonder why the movie didn't do too well.  Yeah.  The chemistry is a little off.  I'd love to see the aftermath.  Just them trying to make nice things at the after party and whatnot.  Oh, my God.  Or just trying to get through the rest of the shoot after that.  Remember when I called you a cunt yesterday?  I really meant like fucking bitch.  I didn't want to say cunt.  All right.  A lot of parents are checking in.  They're juice boxes.  All right. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Fine.  Let's.  All right.  I'm wrong.  Yeah.  It's a juice box.  Not a juicy box.  Snapman from Wack Bag.  There's a juice called Juicy Juice.  Yeah.  And then there's juice boxes.  So you probably just mix those two up.  Snapman from Wack Bag.  He writes, let's shoot this fucker, Lily.  Let's shoot this fucker.  And then Pat from Monaki.  One Looney Tooney.  Two Looney Tooney.  All right.  Well. 
[03:35:30]  There you go.  How did the interview go there, Bobby?  Oh, is that where you was?  Doing an interview?  They didn't know you guys, so then we were just talking about Jimmy's book and talking  about some stuff.  Well, that's always nice to go on a radio show and talk about another radio show.  Because I'm in the book, but I haven't read it yet, but I'm in the book.  So everybody goes, have you read the book?  And I'm like, no.  They're like, oh, you should.  So I'm just dying to see what he's.  I'm sure he's just calling you.  What names he called me.  By the way.  Regenerate.  You're barely in the book.  Yeesh.  Are you in the book more than me?  No.  Okay.  He goes.  Am I in the book at all? 
[03:36:00]  You're.  No.  Really?  Fuck.  I mean, it says Opie and Anthony.  That's it?  That's it.  There's no little tidbit about me?  The only reason I'm in the book is because he tells a story of how we drove to Boston  together, and he has to leak every five minutes.  You know the deal with him.  Yeah, he's a dad.  And we pull into a rest area, and he tells a story of how he got the urinal right next  to me because he wanted to see what I was packing, and then tells the story that  I'm an 11 at a rest area, and he's a four.  That's what I get in his stupid book.  An 11. 
[03:36:30]  In the rest area, I'm considering an 11, and he's a four.  Damn.  I don't get anything.  That's true.  All the stories he could have told, that's the one I get.  Although, no.  He talks about the voyeur bus a lot.  Well, in context of the radio show, but there's no little tidbits about me?  What did he say about me?  Did he talk about me?  You didn't write about me, Tony.  Why didn't you write about me?  Luke, I'm sorry. 
[03:37:00]  I love it.  That dope goes over the edge of the bridge.  Good for him.  The stupid platform shoes.  Crying.  Bobby, we haven't forgotten.  We started about almost two hours ago on this side talking about baseball and how you had  to play baseball by yourself for the most part, right?  Yeah.  We got a little song for you today.  Yeah.  I used to be out there by myself, and actually, you know what I'd do before the first three  innings?  I'd always look, and I'd always keep looking, like maybe.  Because I would always get, I'm going to try. 
[03:37:30]  My mom would always say, I'm going to try.  And I'd always look over, and never.  I'd never.  Did you throw like a girl, because your mom had to be the dad, too?  So you learned how to throw the wrong way?  No, I was actually one of the best guys on the team, which was great.  You can't go with the best?  Well, actually, I threw like a girl.  It's sad, because I didn't even know how to run to first base.  I would swing, and sometimes I'd hit the ball, and then I would just stand there, because  nobody told me to go that way.  So sometimes I'd run to third. 
[03:38:00]  All right.  You were actually really good at baseball?  I was good at sports.  Here's a song called The Greatest.  Little Boy in a Baseball Hat.  Kenny Rogers, everyone, for Bob Kelly.  Little boy in a baseball hat.  I'm Chris Hansen.  Again.  With his ball and bat.  Smoking cigarettes.  Says I am the greatest player of them all. 
[03:38:30]  Puts his bat on his shoulder, and he tosses up his ball.  And the ball goes up, and the ball comes down.  Swings his bat all the way around.  The world's so still, you can hear the sound.  The baseball falls to the ground.  Oh, boy.  Jesus.  Are you getting teary-eyed?  Gary, is he getting teary-eyed?  You know him.  Yeah, he's in a different place right now. 
[03:39:00]  He's 11.  Some deterred.  Says I am the greatest player of the world.  Turn it off, dude.  This ain't working.  He's got tears in his eyes.  Puts his teeth.  He tries it again.  And the ball goes up, and the ball comes down.  Swings his bat all the way around.  The world's so still, you can hear the sound.  The baseball falls to the ground.  Aw.  Oh, my God. 
[03:39:30]  I can't even look at that.  He makes no tears.  Stop this fucking song!  He's got tears in his eyes.  Keep it going.  Tears in his eyes, I guess.  And listens to the cheese.  Very sad, man.  Jesus.  Little boy.  This guy's an asshole.  He adjusts his hat.  Picks up his ball.  Stares at his hat.  What's the count?  He says I am the greatest.  The game is on the line. 
[03:40:00]  And he gives his all.  One last time.  And they still didn't show.  And the ball goes up like the moon's so bright.  Swings his bat with all his might.  And the world's still, still can be.  And the baseball falls.  And that's strike three.  My boy.  And that's supper time. 
[03:40:30]  And his mama calls.  Little boy starts home.  With his bat and ball.  Says I am the greatest.  That is a fact.  But even I didn't know.  I could pitch like that.  Oh.  See?  Says I am the greatest.  He was pitching.  That is understood.  But even I didn't know. 
[03:41:00]  I could pitch that good.  We get it.  We got it the first time, Kenny.  Even after I do the line again, we understood.  Right.  That's great.  So the kid's retarded?  Is that what I'm...  I think we all got a little choked up at the end of that.  We're all kind of looking down at paper, like...  I guess I am.  I am the greatest.  Throw it at E-Rock's head.  I am the greatest.  Oh, we didn't even fucking talk about the baseball. 
[03:41:30]  This is how this started two hours ago with Big Ken's voicemail.  Oh, yeah.  The Hank Aaron.  Barry Bonds.  Before he celebrates his windfall, the New York Mets fan who emerged from a violent scrum  clutching Barry Bonds' record-setting home run ball should probably call his accountant.  As soon as 21-year-old Matt Murphy snagged the valuable piece of sports history Tuesday night,  his souvenir became taxable income in the eyes of the IRS, according to experts. 
[03:42:00]  Fucking A.  It's an expensive catch, said John Barry, a tax lawyer.  Once he took possession of the ball, and it was his ball, it was income to him based on  its value as of yesterday.  Are you fucking kidding me?  The IRS is getting involved in this shit, too?  Gary used to be an accountant.  Yeah, I was an accountant.  Yeah.  Is this true?  Miserable job.  Yeah.  He was an accountant, dude.  Somebody gives you a gift.  Gary used to play football for BC.  All right.  I'm sorry.  I didn't get excited over that.  Thank you.  I figured he was good at sports.  He's 6'6". 
[03:42:30]  No surprise there.  I had no choice.  He sucked his cock.  He sucked his cock.  You made it sound like we're looking at a 5'2 guy and like, you're not going to believe  this.  He's 6'6".  I assumed he was great at every sport.  Dude, he was in the circus.  He was with the midgets.  He was with the midgets.  Yeah.  He's really selling you over here.  Yeah.  Let's see.  So it became, it was income to him based on his value as of yesterday.  That would instantly put Murphy, a college student from Queens, in the highest tax bracket  for individual income, where he would face a tax rate of about 35%. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  So that means if the ball's worth $600,000, which they're saying it's worth about, he  owes the IRS $210,000 fucking dollars for catching that thing?  How do they assess the value of something like that to tax it?  I have no idea.  It's ridiculous.  I'm looking at Gary like, you're an accountant.  Nobody ever caught baseballs and had me appraise them.  Ball assessor or appraiser, yeah.  It says even if he does not sell the ball, Murphy would still owe the taxes based on a reasonable  estimate of its value, according to this guy.  How come they wouldn't wait until he just sells it, because if he doesn't sell it, they 
[03:43:30]  won't get their cut?  I don't get it.  Capital gains taxes also could be levied in the future as the ball gains value, he said.  What?  What if it loses value?  Exactly.  It's got to go down.  Then can you write it off?  Oh, yeah.  On the other hand, here it is.  He said, if the ongoing federal investigation into steroid abuse among professional athletes  takes a criminal turn for bonds, the ball's value could go down, which would likely allow  Murphy to claim a loss.  And then some people are saying this is a little far-fetched. 
[03:44:00]  Not everyone concurs on Barry's interpretation of the intersection between professional sports  and the nation's tax code.  There you go.  I'll just give it to a stripper and have it shoot it out of a twat into a cup.  Hey, we did that.  Did you really?  I was saying, if I was this guy and they were going to tax me that much money, and obviously  you can't afford the tax money, I would burn the ball on TV.  I would get all the cameras, news cameras, and just put gas on it and burn it and go,  there, I owe you nothing. 
[03:44:30]  The ball's valueless.  Now I'm writing off what the ball was valued, because it was valued at $600,000.  Now it's nothing, because it's a burnt-up embers.  So I'm writing off that on my taxes.  You owe me a hell of a lot of money.  Nice.  Yeah, it'll work.  Yeah, it sounded good.  Yeah.  Someone wants us to play teddy bear for Bob.  No.  He got close to...  Did you care about...  Play Christmas shoes, Roe!  Oh, fuck.  Christmas shoes!  I always cry when I hear Christmas shoes! 
[03:45:00]  I just don't like that.  You know what really makes me cry?  I can't watch any of those extreme anything.  What, when they'd make over a house?  Oh, they get the dad, and the mom died, and they did a mural in the baby's bedroom of the  mom's face, and the kid comes in and cries, and the whole family's crying.  Did you see the one where they actually did the house for the people that, like, the kids  didn't have no arms and legs?  Oh, my God.  And they just made the house so they could walk around?  Hell, they need a house bigger than a closet.  Where are they going? 
[03:45:30]  Dude, I love that show.  I do love the show.  They pull the bus away, and the family sees the new house for the first time, and everyone's  crying.  I started laughing my ass off, because I'm thinking, you know, now all the film crews  and the construction people all go away, and now they have this huge mansion in the  middle of the ghetto.  It's like, you know damn well people are like, oh, damn, man, well, they got some shit  in there.  They never leave the house.  That's like Pimp My Ride.  Same fucking thing, yeah.  It's like, yeah, that's great.  Like, those eight plasmas aren't being stolen tonight. 
[03:46:00]  You're basically showing everyone, yeah, the make and the model of the car, and what  town they live in.  Hello.  And then you paint it apple green, and give it a cookie horn.  It's not like it blends in with other cars of that type.  What other car has a hot tub on the roof, you know, with a fucking flat screen TV as the  windshield, you know.  And an espresso maker in the front.  Right, I saw that one.  Fucking idiots.  Just setting up these people for disaster. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, God.  Because these houses, they still have single, you know, one-level houses all around them,  and then there's this four-story mansion in the middle of nowhere.  Their backyards aren't finished.  It's just like tubs and bicycles in their neighbor's backyard.  While they're out of it, they should build, like, watchtowers, because they're going to need them.  And to help you survive in this new home, we've actually given you security for a year. 
[03:47:00]  That's great.  Welcome to the Alamo.  That's why I laugh.  I'm like, are you insane?  What are you doing to these poor people?  This is Opie.  Opie, everybody watches that show and cries.  Opie looks at it and goes, this is dangerous.  Look at all these people around.  All the neighbors have blue shirts, but you can't see, like, they have, like, guns and  machetes waiting to take over as soon as the bus is gone.  The midgets, though, they make me not sad, but I feel for the midget family. 
[03:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  The roll-off.  Well, Opie, I want to get a trebuchet.  We can take the pumpkins, and then we can put them in the trebuchet.  Trebuchet.  We can make extra money.  I mean, I don't know why you're yelling at me.  Dude, Vinny from Stress Factory was in here.  Same voice.  Same fucking voice.  I know it only made, like, a small amount of people laugh, because not a lot of people  watching this show, but those people were laughing fucking hard.  It's the same exact voice.  He is the same thing.  And Matt Roloff, the father, 2D, T-W, 2, D-W. 
[03:48:00]  Thank you.  2D, D-U-I's.  No shit.  Oh, yeah.  Go to TMZ every once in a while.  They have his fucking mugshot and everything.  But it turns out that...  Yeah, but the alcohol leveled to him.  Thank you.  Like, it's a teaspoon.  Two fucking beers.  He's hammered.  He had a cough, and he took some cough syrup, and he shit-faced it.  Oh, I'm gonna shit my pants.  I need it.  I'm gonna shit in a trebuchet, and I'm gonna hit my midget son right in the face. 
[03:48:30]  It just cost me a million on his little leg straightening.  How did he do the sobriety test, like, walking the line with those bow legs?  Just doing that midget walk?  Turned out he was completely sober.  But he couldn't touch...  With those fucking bow legs.  But he couldn't...  Gets him every time.  He couldn't touch his own nose?  Yeah, his arms are too short.  His little T-Rex arms.  All right, touch your earlobes.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Talking about that extreme makeover?  They just did one in Camden, New Jersey? 
[03:49:00]  Oh, boy.  That ain't good.  Whoa!  Actually, they did the whole city.  City, yeah.  That was extreme city makeover.  If you go to...  Yeah, a nuke.  If you go to WPVI.com, Channel 6 in Philly, they have a whole thing on it.  Camden.  Holy shit.  That place is rough.  Camden.  We gotta go there.  I know.  By the way...  When are we going?  September 15th is the big show. 
[03:49:30]  September 15th.  That's a big one, too.  Huge.  Huge.  Oh, yeah.  We got three to go.  Hey, Helicopter J from Farmingdale.  That's a $10 baseball.  You can buy it at any sporting goods store.  The IRS is out of its fucking mind.  That's what you should say.  Hey, hey, just start the play and fetch with it.  The value will go down.  Well, the thing is, the material things.  Like, if you look at the Mona Lisa, it is but canvas and paint.  But, you know...  Oh, fuck, man.  The literal value of it is probably not all that much.  Do you want to go home and get your sword to get this speech? 
[03:50:00]  Big leather...  I'm going to the Renaissance Festival Saturday.  No, you're not.  Yes, I am.  Oh, my God.  In Tuxedo, New York.  You're not wearing outfits.  I might this time because I'm going to videotape a lot of it and put it on the web.  Yeah, I think it'll be funny.  What are you going to wear?  Huh?  All out.  I have my...  D'Artagnan.  What are you wearing?  Actually, I think we have pictures of it because I wore it at Halloween once.  I remember that outfit.  Oh, really?  From one of the Halloween parties.  If you could turn the monitor on, Iraq, maybe find it. 
[03:50:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, you know, the sword, my puffy shirt with the sleeves and the leather suede puffy sleeve thing.  I like those accordion-type neck things that go around your neck there.  Those are pretty rare, but they really make a statement.  They certainly do.  I've never dressed up at a Renaissance Festival, but the only reason I'm doing it is because we're taping it.  Yeah, that's the only reason.  I go like all the other times I did dress up, but I don't want to dress up at a Renaissance Festival. 
[03:51:00]  It's not like you don't have the outfit in it, but I had it for Halloween.  It's not like you've been dreaming about dressing up, and you finally mustered the courage.  No, no, no.  See, you're just smart enough to make it sound cool.  Dude.  You want to dress up at this thing.  You want to sword in one hand.  But in your head, you're like, I'll bring a whole group of people, and we'll say we're filming for the Internet.  Then it's cool.  Then you know he's going to sit under a tree with a chicken bone in one hand and a sword in the other.  It's a turkey leg.  A big turkey leg.  I've never been to one of these.  And a yard of mead. 
[03:51:30]  Right.  And talk about ye good old days.  And the privy.  Yes.  Are you going to steal from the rich and give to the poor?  Yes.  I would buy a pickle from the pickle man.  And then watch the jousts.  You know what aggravates me about those people, though?  You can always see, like, halfway through the day, you look, and you can see, like, their regular underwear, like Fruit of the Moon.  It's like, if you're going to dress up, don't wear underwear and socks.  Some of them don't go all out, either.  They wear, like, the upper half is all ancient England, you know, type of outfit. 
[03:52:00]  And then they're wearing jeans.  Gap jeans.  Like, come on.  And sneakers.  With Reeboks.  I'll admit it.  I've got a picture.  Maybe I'll put up on the website.  From when I was living in Rochester, I went to a Renaissance fair.  And I got some kind of wacky hat on, and I'm throwing axes.  Do you do the axe toss?  I've thrown the axes, but never a wacky hat.  And I've done the archery thing.  Excuse me.  The only way to throw the axes is that you had to put on the wacky hat.  No exception.  No, see, I didn't have to wear the wacky hat.  The archery thing was interesting because we grabbed a shitload of arrows, gave them a shitload of money, 
[03:52:30]  and they were so busy that when they weren't looking, we were taking the arrows, pulling back as far as we could on the bow,  and shooting over the house that had the targets on it into the woods behind it.  And you just feel like, wondering if we're hitting anything.  Hitting some idiot taking a piss back there.  Hey, honey, the ooh.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  We've got to get out of here.  We have meetings.  No.  No.  What meetings?  You forgot or heard the tree.  Yeah, I know. 
[03:53:00]  All right.  Jesus.  I'm like, runner-up line of the day.  We've got a couple of these today, or a few.  I don't know.  Here's one of them.  I want to do it.  You have sweats on today?  No, I don't have sweats.  You always wear sweats.  You could fit in jeans again.  Congratulations.  Can I address two things?  I cut off your laugh.  Sorry.  Ooh.  That was good, though.  That was yours.  That was yours.  I love that he actually gives him a gold star.  He says gold star, but he actually gives himself a gold star.  A gold star.  It's not like, I get gold stars if I get in on this thing. 
[03:53:30]  He was sincere when he said that to you.  He was.  All right.  Hey.  Good for you.  You can hear it, right?  Yeah.  Gary, how long have you known him?  13 years.  How many times in the last two years?  All right.  Three.  Three?  Have you seen him wear nothing but sweats?  He was about 50-50, I think.  Yeah.  I did wear a lot of sweats on tourgasm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I went to Walmart every night and just bought a new pair of sweats.  Wardrobe. 
[03:54:00]  $9 sweats.  All right.  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Leave the intern alone.  What am I doing?  I'm not doing nothing.  She's a girl.  Leave her alone.  I whispered something to her and she brought me the wrong thing.  Oh, really?  I whispered something and she thought I said, I want gum.  Oh, my God.  Why would you want cum?  No, that's not.  Forget it.  You're taking it in another direction.  Yeah. 
[03:54:30]  I didn't say, I want cum.  Yeah, but if she misheard you and you had said something that sounded like, I want gum,  you must have said, I want cum.  Yeah.  Why am I crazy for thinking that?  Yeah, but I want to gum isn't funny.  Yeah.  No, you said that.  See, that's the line.  I want to gum.  She thought I said, I want to gum.  What?  Oh, I want gum.  Thank you for sticking up for me, Ed.  Oh, you want cum?  What do you mean, thank you for sticking up for you?  Thank you.  It doesn't stick up for you?  You have a radio show together for the last 10 years. 
[03:55:00]  It's inevitable.  Like I'm going to stab him in the back over this?  Yeah, what is he going to go, fuck you, Opio.  I'm sick of your shit.  Just fuck you and your stars.  All right?  I'm going with Bobby on this one.  He said, I want to gum.  How important is the board?  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  Why don't you have children now instead of when you're 80 like me?  I'll never see my kids skateboard.  That sure ain't happening. 
[03:55:30]  The boys are spreading the wealth today.  I like that.  Gary Goldman, Gotham Comedy Club, starting tonight, right?  Yes, Thursday through Sunday.  Thanks very much for having me on.  212-367-9000.  How did you feel, your first appearance?  I was 0 for 4, I think.  No.  You were fine, bro.  When Bobby left the room, I hit a fly ball to left field.  Didn't reach the warning track or anything like that.  I felt good, though.  Gary is hilarious. 
[03:56:00]  Your religious stuff that I told you to your face.  Your religious stuff when I saw you at Westbury.  The old Westbury was home.  I was an Asian guy.  Yeah, you're thinking of Jay Davis.  He had all the religion stuff.  It was really, really, really good.  For those playing at home, I was actually here during the Jonah interview.  I just didn't say one thing the entire time.  I choked.  I choked.  It hit in.  I choked.  Intimidated by a 21-year-old actor.  I wouldn't have said anything either.  The other thing, he said, hey, I've seen you perform.  And then it gave me some type of courage to chime in. 
[03:56:30]  No, but Gary, that's the smart thing to do, though, on this show.  Some people feel like, well, I have a mic in front of me.  I've got to talk.  I've got to get up.  Just hang.  And then it comes around to you.  You're like jumping in.  You're jumping in.  You know what?  People would say, good eye.  Good eye, Gary.  Good eye.  See?  That was close.  A lot of people would have swung at that.  But you laid off it.  Don't be bothered by it.  I think I earned a walk today.  Ant and I have been doing this for 13 years.  And there are times somebody comes in and Ant interviews the guy for 20 minutes to the point 
[03:57:00]  where people are like, is Opie even there anymore?  That's just what you've got to do.  That's because you're about to jump over the console and strangle them.  All right.  Good point.  Good point.  Valid point, sir.  Valid point.  You are about to ruin everything.  No, I've been.  Yeah, what?  You've ruined it.  I'm better.  Yeah, you're going to have me.  Bob Kelly's going to be at Mohegan Sun this weekend.  Mohegan Sun all weekend, man.  All right.  Here's your line of the day.  Oh, I see your Jimmy's voice.  The line of the day. 
[03:57:30]  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  The line of the day.  So here's Otto and George.  So here's Mohegan.  An apple in a pool for a week.  There you go.  Brilliant.  I'm queer every day.  Oh.  That's the outro.  That was very good, Bobby.  Steve.  Yes. 
[03:58:00]  We're out of here.  Everyone had fun today.  It was a good show.  Hey, we're going to do the Strauss read?  The Spanish Strauss read bit next?  Okay.  Yeah, for you people that speak Spanish, listen and laugh at me.  Nah, well, yeah.  Back in the day, they thought we were hitting a Spanish audience for some reason with our radio show.  So they actually, this is a true story.  They wanted Anthony to do a commercial in Spanish, but Anthony doesn't speak Spanish.  So it was a whole thing.  It's like a 12-minute bit.  So they spelt the spot out phonetically for me in Spanish, and I just, like, aborted it. 
[03:58:30]  It was just an aborted fetus coming out of my mouth.  And there you go.  Isolate that clip.  And, yeah, it doesn't even resemble Spanish.  It's a mess.  We'll play the whole thing next after the quick break.  Right.  Thanks, guys.  Dude, the Angry Show. </pre>
