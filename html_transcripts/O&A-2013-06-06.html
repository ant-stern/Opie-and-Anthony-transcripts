<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the usual crude and sexually suggestive banter between Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  They spent a significant portion of the early show recapping the previous day's chaotic broadcast, which featured an eclectic mix of A-list and B-list celebrities: Jay Mohr (who unexpectedly appeared), Ethan Hawke, David Lee Roth, and Doc Gooden (a last-minute addition).  The hosts highlighted the comedic contrast between Roth's laid-back demeanor and Gooden's serious, candid discussion of his struggles with drug addiction and missing his World Series parade due to substance abuse.  Listener complaints about the pairing of Roth and Gooden were addressed, along with the scheduling snafu involving Mohr.  They also reviewed Ethan Hawke's movie "The Purge" Rotten Tomatoes score and engaged in a plugola segment for Popcorn Buddha, a company that had sent them a large amount of popcorn, speculating about potential advertising deals.

Further discussion touched on YouTube takedowns of their show (attributed to their lawyers), difficulties with the SiriusXM app affecting listener access, and a listener-sent coffee cake, which prompted humorous anxieties about its potential safety. They reminisced about a previous guest, a cab driver who claimed to be "the world's most positive cab driver." A substantial segment was devoted to Paris Jackson's suicide attempt, with the hosts engaging in a graphic and crude discussion about self-harm, its various methods, and their perceived lethality,  often framing it as a cry for attention.  The dysfunctional nature of the Jackson family was also discussed.

The show shifted gears to discuss an 84-year-old Powerball lottery winner and a humorous hypothetical scenario about the person who let her cut in line. The final segment previewed upcoming guests: Rob Delaney and Crispin Glover, whose performance, "It Is Fine, Everything Is Fine," was detailed.  A clip from Don Imus' show featuring Imus receiving the same promotional gift as Opie was played. The show ended with more crude and sexually suggestive remarks.

A later segment focused on gifts received from Paul Anka (cheap crystal decanters) and Kevin Pollak (a more expensive gift). The hosts joked about destructive ways to dispose of the decanters and recounted a near-death experience they almost inflicted on Pollak by recommending a museum near a building that subsequently collapsed. This sparked a nonsensical discussion about the pronunciation and spelling of "Mutter Museum." Other topics included Don Imus's health and unconventional cancer treatment, a discussion of their podcast (episode four, featuring the “Baby Bird Saga” and Courtney Love),  a segment on a stolen car trunk full of sex toys intended for a bachelorette party (with ensuing vulgar commentary), a listener call about a massive Lego collection and an upcoming sex toy party, a brief playing of a new Nine Inch Nails song ("Came Back Haunted"), and a critical analysis of a Martin Bashir clip discussing the IRS scandal, which the hosts perceived as using coded racist language.  In-studio guest Rob Delaney and phone calls from Vince Vaughn were also mentioned.

A significant portion of the broadcast featured Rob Delaney, who discussed his new board game, "No Respect," inspired by Rodney Dangerfield.  Anecdotes about their experiences with Dangerfield and Bill Cosby were shared.  Delaney discussed his large Twitter following, online haters, and a Twitter exchange where he addressed misogyny in comedy.

Crispin Glover joined the show as a guest. He discussed his current tour featuring screenings of his films, *What Is It?* and *It Is Fine, Everything Is Fine*, accompanied by live performances and book signings. He explained his unconventional filmmaking process, self-financing, and touring methods, emphasizing his critiques of mainstream corporate filmmaking, and his contrasting artistic approach.  His experiences working in Hollywood, including his role in *Back to the Future* and the subsequent lawsuit after being excluded from the sequels, his working relationship with Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, and his differing views on the original film's ending were discussed.

In a later segment with Crispin Glover, the conversation centered on Glover's critiques of Steven Spielberg's films (alleging subtle pro-war messaging), comparing them to explicitly anti-war films.  This critique extended to *Back to the Future*, focusing on a scene suggesting that happiness equates to wealth. He detailed his conflict with Bob Gale over creative differences and inaccuracies in the film's commentary track.  His own projects, including a live performance involving readings from *Rat Catching*, were mentioned.  The segment included considerable technical difficulties with the phone lines, leading to humorous banter between the hosts and the engineer, Mars.  Graphic descriptions of the hosts’ bowel movements were also included. The segment concluded with discussions about upcoming events and mentions of other guests, including Rob Delaney and the possibility of Vince Vaughn calling in.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6 a.m. and this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So pleasured.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to talk about.  Like rotten egg from Sirius XM.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make the fucking second?  With O.P. the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony.  The Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton. 
[00:01:30]  Lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  I would say not many.  Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Starring Jim Norton.  Oh, guys, I'm just one spoke in the wheel. 
[00:02:00]  He's the and-as at the end of the credits.  I'm the Pat Harrington of the show.  That's why I pumped it up a little bit for you there.  We were discussing yesterday's show.  And it was an amazing show.  We had so many A to B listers in here yesterday.  We had the Jay Moore.  We had Ethan Hawke.  We had David Lee Roth.  And we had the great Doc Gooden. 
[00:02:30]  Yes.  Who was not booked.  No, no, we finally figured out how to get him on the show after this debacle.  Yeah, it was a last-minute booking.  And we said, of course, even though we were crazy busy yesterday, of course you make room for Doc Gooden.  Yeah.  And Doc Gooden was a great interview yesterday.  And his book looks like it's going to be terrific.  Jimmy read a bunch of pages already.  And I read my Twitter like we all do.  And people were really frustrated that David Lee Roth was in here with Doc Gooden. 
[00:03:00]  And I couldn't agree less.  Because I love, I personally love chaos.  Yeah.  And David Lee Roth trying to like downplay, not even trying.  In David Lee Roth's world, what Doc Gooden did was no big deal.  No biggie.  And I thought that was hilarious.  He was having a good time.  Right.  That's it.  Doc Gooden would talk about like drugs and booze, whatever, prevented him from attending the parade. 
[00:03:30]  Right.  The big fucking ticker tape parade.  Right, right.  When he won the World Series.  Right.  And it was one of the low points of his life.  Right.  Looking at the parade going on.  And he's with people he doesn't know or care about doing drugs.  And you're listening to this.  It's so compelling.  Yeah.  Our eyes are just all wide watching him talk about this.  And then out of nowhere you'd hear, a boo-dee-boo-dee-bop.  Let me tell you.  When we were on the bus, there was Jack Daniels and the pills. 
[00:04:00]  And we was a boo-dee-boo-dee-bop-dee-bop.  Hey, man, that was a Tuesday night for Van Halen.  That was just a Tuesday night.  Yeah, right.  And you're like, no, Dave.  Dave.  This guy isn't talking about what a great time he was having.  This is a tragedy.  This guy is spilling his soul to us.  His guts.  He's like, yeah, yeah.  86.  Right.  You know, there we are winning the World Series.  And, you know, it was still a rough time. 
[00:04:30]  86 for me.  We were a-wop-dee-dee-bop-dee-bop-dee-bop.  Whoa.  When's it, man, boo-dee-boo-dee-bop.  No, I think basically he said, 86 was a good year for us, too.  Good year for us, too.  Yeah, way.  Meaning that should be a great year for Doc Gooden.  Dave, no.  Dave.  See, what he's saying is.  I would have David Lee Roth in here every day.  Oh, it was fucking hilarious.  I know people are moaning right now, but I would have him in every day.  He's a fun dude, man.  He is just, he is Mr. Fucking Fun.  You talk about anything. 
[00:05:00]  Mr. Fucking Fun.  He's all about having a good time.  He just, that's no, God.  Had no concept what Doc Gooden went through.  No.  Oh, God.  God.  Oh, that's great.  In a perfect world, sure, you have Doc Gooden in here by himself.  Yeah.  So we can really get into it, but I kind of liked it yesterday.  Yeah.  It was just crazy.  Oh, it was funny.  There were so many times.  Like, something would happen, I'd just look at Opie like, what?  We're looking at each other like, both of us with butthead faces on. 
[00:05:30]  At some point, Jay tried to say something, and Diamond Dave just fucking plowed right over  him, and Jay just threw his hands up in the air and stood like, what happened?  And we wanted to say to Jay, now you know how we feel.  Oh, shit.  Because he's chaos, too.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's a guy.  Here's a guy.  Hey, yo, well, here's a guy.  No, we obviously love when Jay comes in. 
[00:06:00]  Yes.  He might be coming back today.  What a pisser, man.  And then the listeners thought we were shutting out Jay on purpose.  No.  No.  We weren't.  He wasn't scheduled yesterday, either.  Yesterday was a weird fucking day.  Oh, that's weird.  Because Jay, I could even show the text messages if you care, but he started texting me going,  hey, I want to come in Thursday and Friday.  I'm like, that's great.  We haven't seen you in a while.  Yeah.  And then next thing you know, he writes me and goes, I can't wait to see you tomorrow,  meaning Wednesday.  I'm like, what?  Huh?  What?  I thought we set this up for Thursday.  Whatever.  It's fine.  Yeah.  So we threw him into this mix. 
[00:06:30]  So we knew we had a busy show yesterday in general.  So Jay was like, Jay and Doc Gooden weren't scheduled for yesterday's show.  No.  Worked out well, though.  Oh, fucking Diamond Dave, man.  That was fun.  He is the best.  Diamond Dave.  He is the best.  Just...  He is all over the place, man.  He's terrific.  What a fucking...  What a rock star. 
[00:07:00]  And Ethan Hawke was great, huh?  Yeah, he was fun, too.  His movie, The Purge.  Oh, look out.  Does that look good?  Actually, that sounds pretty cool.  Does that look good?  Rotten Tomatoes is sort of like...  I think it's starting to lean toward the Rotten Tomato category.  I mean, come on.  It's not the king's speech here we're talking about.  It's action.  Oh, it's still 56, so is that fresh still?  Yeah, Rotten Tomatoes, if you don't know by now, I think most people do.  You want your movie to be a fresh tomato. 
[00:07:30]  Yes.  Not a Rotten Tomatoes.  Fresh tomato.  And it's still in the Fresh category at 56%.  That should be fresh, yo.  No, it's not.  Uh-oh.  What, what?  I don't know what the percentage is that qualifies for fresh.  Oh, but it shows rotten.  I don't see a tomato next to it.  It's not a 50-50.  You see the splattered...  I see rotten.  Oh, yeah.  You see the splattered green mater.  Okay, so the movie has entered into the splattered category.  I wonder what the percentage is.  Maybe 60?  Maybe.  Yeah, because Epic is 61%. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, probably 60 makes it a fresh, yeah.  So that's right on the border being a fresh.  I don't know, whatever.  It's a good concept.  It looks like a good movie.  You want today's plugola?  More plugola?  Oh, yeah.  Yesterday was Popcorn Buddha.  Do we still have a lot of popcorn in the office?  Yeah, there's some popcorn in the office.  Man, let me tell you.  I went home with the salt and vinegar.  Yeah.  Oh, my shit.  Ate the whole fucking bag.  Amazing.  Ate the whole damn thing. 
[00:08:30]  And, man, were they...  The bacon and cheese was a hit in my house, and I got a request to bring some more home.  They were getting a lot of fucking...  More of the cheesy flavors I need to bring home.  They were getting a lot of responses on Twitter there.  Yeah, I got a couple tweets saying, just place an order.  Thanks to you guys.  All that.  Jesus.  They don't even advertise with us.  Nope.  It was nice they sent, you know, a huge box of popcorn, but next time, it's got to be  the envelopes.  You think the...  It's got to be the envelopes.  Facts.  You think the sales department got on the phone? 
[00:09:00]  Nope.  Of course not.  And called them like, hey, this is a good fit.  Of course not.  These guys actually love your product.  They talk about...  I don't even have to ask anyone.  Of course not.  That would be what the proverbial no-brainer...  That would be a no-brainer.  You know, a company like that, I mean, they're out of Stroudsburg, but they do online business.  Yeah.  They probably could get a short run of advertising on our show, maybe a week to two weeks, and  I think they would probably go for that.  Yeah.  But I guarantee no one made a phone call to them. 
[00:09:30]  I guarantee it.  God.  And I don't know.  Supposedly the lawyers, if you want to do some housekeeping here, supposedly the lawyers  are shutting down YouTube accounts again.  Oh, yeah?  That's what I've been reading all night long.  All night long.  Why?  I don't know.  You know.  I didn't see that.  So we've got to talk to Baldy today about that.  Well, I have no respect for the guy. 
[00:10:00]  He tells me one thing.  He says, supposedly they were going after people that are just putting full shows up  on YouTube.  So I got the word out.  I said, look, you know, I think they don't mind if there's a clip or two here and there,  but if you're doing full shows, they're having a problem with that.  And I did tell the underground people that.  So if it's something different than that, then Baldy's lying to our faces.  Well, that's what it was started as. 
[00:10:30]  That's what I heard.  I don't know how it turned into that other thing.  Well, the problem for us as a brand, you know, if you don't have satellite radio, you're really  closed in, which is kind of strange because when we first got into satellite radio, we  felt like it opened up the whole, you know, country to our show, but you know, they're  not really into the internet thing.  No.  So they're kind of closing us off.  That's why we started that podcast to at least get, get a taste out there for everybody. 
[00:11:00]  Yes.  You know, cause the, the online app is horrendous.  I hear, I hear from the people every fucking day and you know, they don't really understand  the internet as a whole, this place.  Is it amazing how much the online feed stinks?  Like it's a every day, every day is a problem.  We could talk about it every day.  It's so, I mean, I read your tweets every day and I acknowledge that you're, you're telling  me that the online feed sucks.  I, we don't know what to do.  Yeah.  We tell them all the time, right? 
[00:11:30]  You know, and then, uh, they put video clips up there that, that get no action cause they  don't know how to work the internet.  Frank show.  So we kind of like when some of our shit is up on YouTube cause it gets out there to,  uh, you know, everyone else, the YouTubes, I mean, they're making it more and more expensive  to get this service.  So I think it's about $8,000 a year to listen to us at this point.  That's fair.  Yeah.  Well worth it.  Here's today's, uh, I'm being told by the way that, that someone took it upon herself 
[00:12:00]  to call popcorn Buddha from sales.  Oh, it might be related to one of our, uh, well, she's a great sales person.  She took it upon herself to call popcorn.  When we talk about, uh, the sales department, I'm looking at you, sir.  I'm not talking about her.  Oh boy.  She's, she's great, but she, her hands are tied cause it's a shitty department.  Well, I've told you, she should run the department.  I've told her to get Exxon mobile on this show and general foods. 
[00:12:30]  I want, I want those wholesome appetizers.  I don't even know who's in charge of sales here.  I don't know who's in charge of sales.  I don't know who's in charge of, uh, you know, PR.  I don't even know who the CEO is.  I don't even know his name.  I just drift through, uh, existence here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, Ben, I think it's a better way to be.  Yeah.  At this point I started heading that way about a year ago.  I think it's a better, I think it's a better place to be.  Um, so you want today's plugola? 
[00:13:00]  What is it?  Yesterday was popcorn.  Yeah.  Today it's an individual that gets the plugola.  Now is this, uh, this is entering a whole new realm.  That's fine.  Individual payola.  What do they get?  Payola slash plugola.  Well, I guess this guy just gets his Twitter, uh, promoted.  Oh, so if people want to have their Twitter promoted, they're, they send us gifts.  Hey man, you see what we got in front of us.  Oh, you know how hard this is to get? 
[00:13:30]  I know.  This is almost impossible to get.  Okay.  Oh my God.  And I got one right in front of me for all of us to enjoy.  It is right there.  You want me to read the letter?  Please.  This guy actually typed out a fucking letter to Opie and Anthony and old Jimmy.  Aw.  Good morning, boys.  Hope you're having a nice morning.  Opie always complains that there are no Enzismans.  Enzismans.  That's how he spelled it. 
[00:14:00]  Enzismans.  Coffee cakes in his neighborhood.  I decided to send you one because of the entertainment that you guys provide to me each morning.  Wow.  That's great.  Please enjoy the rice and I've sprinkled on it.  Oh, you don't think I checked the seal?  Yeah.  Check that.  I checked all the seals.  They look legit.  Oh, man.  You should not worry.  There's nothing wrong with this cake was the next line.  Oh, gee.  That means there's something wrong with the cake, right?  Oh, no.  But if you have doubts, I left you my address or you can test this delicious cake on E-Rock. 
[00:14:30]  E-Rock, you want to be our food taster for the show?  No.  Listener food is death.  Wow.  Because it's always horrible and I don't trust it.  How is this horrible?  Look.  It doesn't make it.  It looks a little greasy like he had greasy hands on the cellophane.  Nervous hands.  Nervous hands on this part.  I think that might be from the transit that it went through to get here.  Yeah.  You'd have a piece, wouldn't you, Ed?  Yeah, he's going to have a piece.  Oh, he's looking at it.  Now I'm getting all nervous.  Nah, Kenny's not going to be happy.  Kenny, never, never happy when the... 
[00:15:00]  You guys could study the seal.  This is a perfect seal.  Could have used the hot glue gun.  That's true.  No.  That's true.  That's true.  Are the perforations closed?  Yeah, everything looks good, man.  Everything looks good.  Now I'm not going to eat it.  This thing is only $6.69, by the way.  Really?  Why can't we just buy one?  Because we can't find them.  How are they not find-it-able?  And then the guy says, I was in your XM Studios when you were on 57th Street.  I was responsible for bringing you the world's most positive cab driver. 
[00:15:30]  But Jimmy brought him.  Well, I mentioned him, but that guy might have brought him in.  I had taken his cab, Paul, I think his name was.  And listened to his drivel.  We hated him.  He's just a weird guy.  Do we have a clip of him?  He was awful.  He gave Jim a card, too, right?  Yeah.  You know what?  That might be how we got him.  But he gives out your card.  Hi, I'm the world's most courteous cabbie.  And I love doing my job.  And he had a red, white, and blue tie on. 
[00:16:00]  And he fucking drives with a hat.  Like a chauffeur.  Yeah.  But he's in a yellow cab.  He's a crazy person.  He was nuts.  But he was a nice man.  He was so hateable.  And even one that isn't one of these Indian Sikhs that drives a cab, they're crazy people.  No, the white, oh, what did you say?  White cab drivers.  Yeah, yeah.  Are way crazier than any other cab driver in New York City.  They're rare, but if you're a white guy.  You wonder right away what happened to your life that you're driving a cab. 
[00:16:30]  Because if you come from another country, you know, being a cab driver seems like the greatest job ever.  Yeah.  But if you talk to those guys, they drive for 12 straight hours every day, seven days a week.  And then you'll learn they have families and stuff.  It's like, when do you sleep?  It's a horrible job.  And they're making it worse and worse for these guys in New York City.  I can't really have sympathy.  I drive amongst them.  And all I want to do is ram them off the road.  Oh, are they just pieces of shit out there? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  No, no courtesy whatsoever.  Enjoy the treat.  Thanks for the laughter all these years.  Sincerely, Arcady T.  And his Twitter is at off underscore duty.  Arcady T.  It sounds like a fucking, like one of those, what do they call them when the words were all scrambled?  Acronym?  Yeah.  No.  It's not an acronym.  What is it?  Acronym is like...  Anagram?  Anagram.  Anagram.  That's an...  Your anagrams are showing.  That's exactly how I do that. 
[00:17:30]  From Sounds of the Lambs.  Sounds of the Lambs.  Yeah.  Dr. Lecter.  Your anagrams are showing Dr. Lecter.  Yeah.  Lewis' friend, poisoned cake.  Poisoned cake.  That's who you wanted to take cake from.  The guy's Twitter name is something underscore duty.  Yeah, really.  I love your Clarice.  I do a very good Clarice.  People saw that.  We thought it was her.  It was beautiful.  Well, it's a lecture.  So let's enjoy some classic crumb coffee cake, courtesy of Arcady T. 
[00:18:00]  I just wanted to bring up one more thing with her.  In Sounds of the Lambs.  Yeah.  When the worst line she says in that voice is when she's trying to squeak under the door,  the storage locker door.  If anything happens here, you can call me up here.  Call the field office.  Her voice gets so fucking dikey deep.  She's sliding under that door.  Call me up here, field office.  Here's a number.  Here's a number. 
[00:18:30]  Must have been a long day of acting and she couldn't act.  I don't know what happened there.  Like a straight woman anymore?  It's a very weird moment.  It was, yeah, sure did it happen.  She was like, huh.  So once again, this guy's Twitter, at off underscore duty.  He gets to plug a hole today.  When you open, make sure all the perforations are perforated and the sides are all, it looks  factory.  Oh, no, this is perfect.  Oh, God.  Powdered sugar could be anything. 
[00:19:00]  Smell that.  Tell me you're not going to.  I agree.  You're going to eat it?  I probably will.  God damn it.  Can we get a knife, please?  The boss wants a knife.  Please.  Where's everybody bringing the boss's knife?  Where's the knife?  Mars must have.  Any knives, plates.  Just wipe the blood.  Of course he has a knife.  Look.  Of course he does.  I'm not going to have that cut with his fucking knife.  Who knows where that's been?  You know there's still dry blood on it.  He's cleaning his fingernails out with it.  He's stripping wires.  Doing all kinds of engineering shit with it. 
[00:19:30]  Shanking people in the neighborhood.  Right.  We're doing them wrong.  Doing that below the fucking belt.  Stabbing.  So it's not a fucking attempted murder.  So you're just stabbing the fucking ass.  You know that.  Jesus.  I didn't know that.  You go up.  You fucking just work your arm.  Like fucking.  Just fucking like sewing machine.  Right on his fucking thighs and ass.  Nice.  And you walk away.  Like nothing happened.  And he's there going.  So Paris. 
[00:20:00]  Paris Jackson attempted suicide.  Oh yeah.  And this gets us into an area where.  It's going to be a bit controversial.  But we bring this up a lot.  You find it.  Huh?  Sorry.  Your Holocaust denial.  Did you find it?  Oh you found this?  Right.  You just stay here.  I'll be back in one minute.  There she goes.  She's getting the jack.  All right. 
[00:20:30]  All right.  She's getting the jack out of the.  The car to jack up the door.  Because it's jammed.  Everything should go over.  Ha ha ha.  It's so bad.  But it's one of those movies you just.  If it's on.  You just got to watch it.  Well.  She is such a bike.  It's stuck.  Can you hand me that flashlight, Sean?  Sure. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  Okay.  Oh boy.  There he is.  Oh.  Um.  If this door should fall down.  Or anything else.  This is the number for our Baltimore field office.  Baltimore field office.  Now they know that you're with me.  You call them if anything should happen.  This is the number of our Baltimore field office.  Ha ha ha.  I love it. 
[00:21:30]  I love it.  All right.  Bye bye.  A bit exaggerated on your part.  When you're watching it.  I remember that.  I knew exactly the line.  He meant.  Baltimore field office.  Baltimore field office.  Ha ha ha.  Every bit of fucking whatever lady-like things she had in her voice went away.  Yeah.  Boop, boop, boop.  So, Paris Jackson.  Yeah.  Attempted suicide, which gets us into a sensitive area, because we've discussed this over the  years, that we personally feel, on this show, we should put a percentage. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, I would love to hear a percentage of this.  No, we'll just put a percentage to save our own asses.  I think over 90% of the people that slit their wrists are not trying to kill themselves.  Because if you're really trying to kill yourself, there's so many other ways to do it.  I think it's higher than 90.  I know.  I'm just trying to be nice.  Yeah, yeah.  I would say, I was going to say 99%.  It's more, you're screaming for attention.  Because if you, the people that really are trying to kill themselves, they're the ones 
[00:22:30]  jumping off the fucking bridges.  Yeah, or shooting themselves in the head.  Shooting themselves in the head.  Hanging themselves, knowing that that's pretty tough to get out of.  Jumping off the top of a building.  Walking in front of a train.  That's all way past the, I'm just looking for attention shit.  Yeah, yeah.  I would really like to know what the percentage of people that honestly try to kill themselves  and succeed by slitting the wrists. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  Like how many people actually die from that?  It's probably the ones that realize they have actual shitty family members and they took  their time getting to the house.  Yeah, yeah.  So you get a little lightheaded waiting for your relatives to save.  And then maybe you pass out and bleed to death.  Yeah, yeah.  But in general, I don't think many people end up dying from their wrists being slit.  The ones who do slit them up.  I mean, I did.  It's attention.  The guys who do it accurately go from the fucking base all the way up on their fucking 
[00:23:30]  ass.  Those guys open veins.  So let's adjust what we're saying then.  If you go, if you go just this way, the short way across the wrist.  You're not looking to hit the fucking, you're not looking to hit the artery.  You're looking for attention.  Yeah, of course.  And obviously that means you got some issues.  But when they say, you know, attempted suicide, I don't know.  I think it's attempting fucking attention. 
[00:24:00]  And then you're like, and at least our bit, where then you have to get involved.  It's just like, oh man, it's fucking nice out.  Right.  I have the day off.  This is going to be fucking great, man.  I'm going to, you know what?  I think a few friends over.  Not really.  I'm awake.  Thank you, E-Rock.  Jesus, E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  Why?  You know what? 
[00:24:30]  You know what?  Forget it.  No, no.  No, it's one of my favorite bits.  Forget it.  No.  Forget it.  I like it.  Oh, come on.  Oh, man.  Sal wouldn't have fucking played that.  That's a whole nother bit.  He would have took us to break.  Why not just play the circus music?  Oh, no, no, no.  Oh, man.  Where's the Mike Schmidt clip?  Oh, my God, right?  Oh, E-Rock.  Jesus, E-Rock.  And you should have hit the circus music right there.  It would have been very funny.  Oh, no. 
[00:25:00]  Don't hit him now.  Stop spoiling everything.  Don't hit it now.  He's got cake on the mind.  Yeah.  He's like, oh, I want to eat it, but it might be poison.  Exactly.  I don't know what to do.  He's getting juice all over the fucking keyboard because his hands were pickled.  His feet.  His feet.  His feet.  By the way, let the record show that we still don't have a knife.  Oh, we got him right there, yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Yeah.  I didn't see you come into the studio.  So, uh...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're just...  Well, honestly, because I can imagine how bad it would be that you're hanging out. 
[00:25:30]  You think you got the day off.  All your friends.  You're going to have a good day.  Maybe the pool's open.  Maybe you're going to take a swim.  Maybe you're going out for a nice long drive.  It's just something fun.  Right.  And then your phone rings and you're like, wait, what is this?  I...  I...  Hello?  Hello?  What's the matter? 
[00:26:00]  Oh, my God.  What's...  Who is this?  You're looking at your watch and I'm like, what time is it?  What the...  All of a sudden you realize there's going to be a problem.  What did you do?  What did you do now?  I just...  I don't want to live anymore.  Fuck.  Here goes my day.  Fuck.  This is the whole day. 
[00:26:30]  And don't lie to yourself.  You motherfucker.  I know we're talking to people where this has happened and the first thought is, fuck,  here goes my day.  All right.  What...  What did you do?  Tell me what you did.  I cut my wrist.  I just want to die.  You fucking piece of shit.  Beautiful day.  Now I got to drive over there. 
[00:27:00]  Oh, my God.  How bad is it?  How bad is it?  It's just blood everywhere.  I'm seeing blood.  It's blood.  I just don't care.  If you didn't care, you wouldn't fucking call me.  Right.  Right.  If you'd fucking call me and I'd be out fucking hanging out, having a good time.  You piece of shit.  Are you getting woozy? 
[00:27:30]  Are you getting woozy?  This is the first number I saw on my phone.  Oh, great.  Just forget it.  Forget I called.  I'm hanging out.  I just don't even...  Forget it.  Enjoy your life.  Have a good life.  I'm just kidding.  Can you wrap something around it?  I'll be right over.  Just wrap something around it and we'll talk.  We'll talk about this.  There's nothing to talk about.  There's nothing to talk about. 
[00:28:00]  Fuck it.  Oh, my God.  I'm so woozy.  I took some pills, too.  I don't know what they were.  What do you mean you don't know what they were?  I don't know what they were, but I took a bunch of pills.  How many pills did you take?  I don't know.  One or 20.  Of course.  I don't even know the time.  All right.  I'll be right over. 
[00:28:30]  Fuck.  Hey, hold on.  10.30 a.m.  11.30, 12.30.  Maybe a couple of hours I'm over there.  If I could just fucking see if this is even an issue.  Oh, God.  How fucking annoying.  My favorite part of that is the sounds of the crying.  Oh, just.  Just.  In the background.  No, stay on the phone. 
[00:29:00]  Stay on the phone.  Don't.  I just don't care.  I just don't.  No one cares about me, so I'm not going to care about me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  You fuckers.  Might have been there.  Oh, boy.  A few of us have been there.  Oh.  It's the worst, isn't it?  Oh, God.  But then the news jumps on an attempted suicide.  I don't know. 
[00:29:30]  They show her wrist?  I wasn't in her house.  I mean.  Oh, you've seen a picture of the wrist already?  Yeah, that's in the paper today.  It's a.  It's a.  She's waving.  No, that's.  That's an old pic.  Okay, but I'm saying.  Yeah, show her that she's a cutter.  A cutter, right.  She is a cutter.  She's a cutter.  She's got some old, either scars or maybe just scratches around her wrist.  Oh, those are like scars.  Yeah.  That's a weird.  You know, there are certain things that are broken down along racial lines.  Black people don't really commit suicide, but that is a fucking white person thing, cutting 
[00:30:00]  like that.  Yeah.  Mostly white girl.  You don't see black cutters.  Yeah, I don't know what it.  You know, I know.  I know.  I did it.  So I'm like a fucking.  My ex always mocks me.  What a fucking teenage lesbian I was.  She told me I was a fucking lesbian.  She's right.  So when you cut your wrist, you weren't trying to kill yourself, right?  No, no, no.  It was for tension.  I cut just to feel something.  I don't feel anything.  So I cut to feel something. 
[00:30:30]  Feel a job.  No, it was not sincere.  I met a really sexy girl who had them all up and down her arms and she was fucking juicy  and sexy.  I'm like, oh, man.  Did you know that when there's like, when there's ones that are obviously many, many years old  and then there's the ones that are fucking, oh, great.  That looks like it's three days old.  Wow.  He's still up to this.  Yeah.  I forget I got the mark sometimes.  It's a little embarrassing.  Like, you know, I've got my friends who gives a fuck, but like people you don't know.  Yeah.  You're talking and you catch them looking like, oh, God. 
[00:31:00]  Like, oh, no.  I haven't noticed them in years.  Yeah, you just don't think.  Let me see yours.  Where are they?  It's fucking, uh.  Jesus.  Aw, Jimmy.  Yeah, you went to the side a little bit.  Yeah, of course.  Aw.  Yeah.  It was more just, you know, you're angry and you do something.  Wow.  But it was not for true suicide attempts at all.  Oh, man.  Because if you want to kill yourself, you do it.  You go to the top of the building and you jump or you stand in front of a bus.  Right.  Or on the fucking highway.  You just jump in front of a truck.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If you really want to do it.  If you really want to kill yourself, we all know how to do it. 
[00:31:30]  There are people who are foiled, like people who are awakened or when someone comes home  early and finds them.  Like, there are legitimately people who are foiled.  But, you know, most times you fucking, you want to do it, you do it.  Yeah, the slicing thing is, that's kind of...  Well, they're all over the TV with it saying, attempted suicide.  She took a shitload of Motrin, I guess.  That was her OD attempt.  The only for her pills?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Motrin. 
[00:32:00]  She made me mad.  I did enough with this family.  Because you know the whole family had to get involved.  Oh, rescue.  They're all talking to each other.  How many pills did she take?  I don't know.  Hoo.  Hoo.  Hoo.  That's her cry for help.  Hoo.  Hoo.  Hoo.  Then again, how do you expect emotional stability growing up in that fucking nut house?  The family has fucking...  They're mental patients.  Stop with this fucking, like, hero worship of the dumb Jackson family.  What a bunch of douchebags. 
[00:32:30]  Yuck.  Yeah, see, Paris Jackson is physically fine after a suicide attempt.  The new wacko Jacko.  Yeah.  She's the new wacko Jacko.  Should be on Oprah.  What happened?  I was just feeling so much...  Then again, it is her dad that died, so I guess...  It's awful.  Her father's the biggest star in the world, and he's gone.  All your cred goes out the window.  Oh, it's horrible.  Dad's schmad.  He had nothing to do with fucking her coming into this world.  And he's consistently shit on in the news.  You know, and she's...  Yeah.  She's loved him, so I...  Yeah.  She's 15.  Yeah, that does make me stop and not, because she is 15, and he died when she was, what, 
[00:33:00]  12?  And so imagine your father being the biggest star in the world.  That's extremely sad.  Yeah, for her.  The whole thing is really sad.  No doubt.  That's how my kids are going to feel.  Yeah.  Yes.  Biggest star.  Or sad.  Oh, I was just thinking about the whole kid allegations thing.  Oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  I mean, so I guess it's hard to kill her because she's fucking 15.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  I hope she gets the help she needs.  There you go.  That's how you do it.  We can only hope she gets the help she so desperately needs.  She has a meat cleaver on her arm, which makes it sound like she put her arm down and went  to hack.  Right, right.  But if you just take it and rub it on you.  She's probably turned the meat cleaver upside down and rubbed her arms on it.  Yeah, yeah.  She tenderized her wrist with the end of the meat cleaver.  Exactly.  That's one clever cleaver.  She's off suicide watch already.  Great.  Great.  They took her off on the way to the hospital.  Yeah.  It just brings back our bit because we all deal with emotionally unstable people in our 
[00:34:00]  lives.  Oh, yeah.  How it just ruins your day or your weekend.  Just throws a fucking monkey wrench into everything you want it to do.  Right.  It's terrible.  And I know it sounds harsh, but that's the reality of it.  None of us want to deal with this shit.  Oh, I'm having a fun.  You're skipping through life.  This is great.  Oh, who's this on the phone?  Oh, what's this?  Oh, fuck. 
[00:34:30]  I get my mom calling in complete emotional breakdown.  Oh, man.  Crying.  That's how the phone call starts.  And I obviously know it's her.  And then I have to play my part.  What's wrong?  But she hears my teeth clenching.  Yeah, yeah.  What's wrong?  Oh, forget about it.  I should have never called.  That hangs up.  I'm like, that's great.  You know what?  Because now I used to.  I don't know as much anymore. 
[00:35:00]  Then I have to chase that down.  I wouldn't.  Oh, never.  But it's like, yeah, of course not.  I'd be like, thank God.  Now I could do what I was going to do and not even give this another fucking thought.  Greg.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Forget it.  I should never call.  Forget it.  Oh, okay.  I'll just forget it.  All right.  I will.  Because there's not a mother-son bond at all.  Yeah.  If it was a complete stranger that called me like that, I would forget it.  Yes, of course.  You're not running over there like some kind of a movie. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, God.  Where the young son runs over to his mom's house.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Oh, my God.  We all deal with it in different ways, right?  Yeah.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Let's eat some crumb cake.  Crumb?  Some crumb cake?  And then when we come back, I would love to discuss the 84-year-old woman that I hope  hires security.  Holy shit.  She won the Powerball, huh?  I thought we knew who won that thing, and we just didn't.  No, they hadn't announced anything. 
[00:36:00]  $590 million solo winner.  This fucking waste.  84.  What a waste.  Well, you know how she won it.  Let's talk about it now.  We still got some time.  Oh, yeah.  She came out, and she had a handwritten note.  She said, while in line, another lottery player was kind enough to let me go ahead of  him.  Oh, my God.  To purchase the winning quick pick ticket.  That's why you never do that stuff.  Never.  Because now you've got to live with that.  The only thing that should keep that guy from killing himself is if he was playing his 
[00:36:30]  numbers already.  Right, right.  Some people play their birthdays or whatever.  So, if that guy was playing his regular numbers and that's all he did, then it wouldn't  matter.  Well.  Hi.  I just cut my wrist.  I am off.  You got a minute.  I really got to tell you what happened.  What happened?  I was on line, lottery, and this 84-year-old woman was behind me. 
[00:37:00]  Excuse me.  And I thought I'd be a good guy.  I thought I'd be nice.  I could wait.  I could wait.  It wasn't.  I wasn't standing.  My legs are strong.  She was old.  I said, go ahead.  Holy shit, I'll be right over.  That would be a scenario where you would understand.  Holy shit, I'll be right over.  I don't give a fuck.  I'm dropping everything.  Forget it.  Just call the bottom of my field.  What would you say?  Hey, man, I'm going to miss you. 
[00:37:30]  Click.  Dummy.  No, that you'd be like, holy.  You can understand that.  Yeah.  Now, the lady's saying this guy was kind enough to let her play before him.  So how about the lady, who's 84, who will never go through $590 million, do the right  thing and show her kindness and give her a little taste?  Well, they have family.  I think she splits it with her son.  Like, I think that they had agreed beforehand to split whatever winnings either one of them  had, which means it's all going to go to the sun eventually.  So she probably would give this guy something, but who knows what the fan would go, no. 
[00:38:00]  You've got to give that guy a taste.  How do you know who he is?  She gets 270.  I don't know who he is.  Oh, he'll come forward.  What?  She gets 270 after everything's said and done.  Yeah.  He might not remember, dude.  He might have been a trucker going through or some guy just didn't trick.  What's he going to know?  A lot of guys are going to come forward now like, wait a minute, I let someone get some  old bag in front of me.  Fuck.  Wow, that close.  Can you imagine?  Oh, no.  I would commit suicide, and I know that that's ridiculous.  You'd never be able to accept that. 
[00:38:30]  No.  I would try to find religion.  I would go back to Catholicism and go, God made this happen.  Because the only way I could do it is that God had a reason.  It's the only way I could convince myself, don't put your head in an oven.  That is a crossroad moment in your life, where it's like, okay, in an alternate universe  where I didn't let her in front of me, I was just rich and fucking amazing life.  You just turn on the news and you're like, oh, I remember her.  She was good.  Hey.  Oh. 
[00:39:00]  I let her cut in front of me.  I let her cut in front of me.  Oh, that was you?  Oh, my God.  No, I can't.  No.  I can't.  No.  No.  No.  So we got a lot of people calling in and stopping by again today.  We got possibly Jay Moore stopping in again.  Jay Moore.  We got Rob Delaney coming in at 8 o'clock.  Yeah.  Very funny man.  And then we got a strange bird coming in today.  I'm looking forward to this one.  Oh, yes.  Crispin Glover will be here today. 
[00:39:30]  Yes.  George McFly.  Now, you've been doing research on Crispin Glover.  What is he up to these days?  He's always into the weirdest shit ever.  These days, he's doing, and this is what he's promoting.  It's a...  What is it?  Try to describe it.  I think it's a movie and a talk and a slideshow and some...  Slideshow.  ...books.  I'm really not sure.  I know.  I read this and I was like, I don't know what this is.  I haven't been, so I can't say what it is, but I know that he does a slideshow presentation 
[00:40:00]  where he talks, and then I think there's a film afterwards.  I don't even know what this is supposed to be.  It's called It Is Fine, Everything Is Fine.  Which is the second movie that he's done.  It's at...  The first movie was called What Is It?  Right.  And what was that about?  I don't know, but I think It Is Fine.  Everything Is Fine.  It's at the Museum of Arts and Design.  I would go to this.  How do we...  Oh, yeah.  And then it's described as Crispin Glover's Big Slideshow, which is a one-hour dramatic 
[00:40:30]  narration of eight different profusely illustrated books.  Yeah.  And then I think...  What does that mean?  And then I think he shows the movie.  From what I understand, he's written books.  Right.  But he's not so much written books as he has taken really old public domain books and rewritten them.  What?  Where does the slideshow come in?  I don't know. 
[00:41:00]  What's the slideshow?  I'm so excited to talk to him.  Wait, what?  Those books no one gives a fuck about anymore.  Just like, you know, public domain stuff.  He finds the books that no one gives a fuck about anymore, and then what?  He juices them up?  He completely changes the story.  What's like a public domain type book?  What would be considered?  Off the top of my head, like, the story of Peter Pan is public domain.  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  The story of Peter Pan, not Disney's Peter Pan.  No, Disney made Disney's Peter Pan.  So what would Crispin Glover do if he had Peter Pan?  I don't know. 
[00:41:30]  Make it about something completely different.  I'd write stories.  Oh, I can't wait.  He is a strange guy.  I've loved his David Letterman appearances over the years.  I watched an interview with him back in 2010 talking about it, and he still will not confirm  or deny if that was him on David Letterman.  Yeah.  If it was even him.  Yeah, yeah.  He loves, he said, I love the fact that 25 years later or whatever, people are still talking  about him.  People are still making assumptions. 
[00:42:00]  And was he in a character, was he playing a character from, from some movie that wasn't  even out yet?  Or what was he doing?  It's the only time Letterman's ever walked off the set live on air.  He was fucking zooted.  You think so, Chip?  What was that appearance about again for the people?  What did he do?  Yeah.  He was wearing a wig and platform shoes, and he did this huge kick towards Letterman's  head, and then eventually Letterman's just like, I'm going to go check on the top 10  list.  Has he been back on since?  Yeah, he was back on like two or three times. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, they've always been great.  And he still won't say whether or not that was him.  He collects a lot of weird shit too, right?  I remember he was into collecting skulls or something.  Really?  Yeah.  He was in Willard.  Oh, wow.  The remake of the...  Oh, the remake.  Okay.  I liked it.  Yeah, yeah.  It was great.  Oh, you guys want to watch a clip of a performance of the book?  Yes.  Yeah.  Please.  Please.  It looks like...  It looks like an oldie-style TV show. 
[00:43:00]  Good evening.  What it is, and how it is done, by Crispin Hullion Glover.  Introduction.  A few years ago, a very few years ago, this happened, but I confused it with this. 
[00:43:30]  I don't know if...  Because you're showing the pictures are appearing on the screen, too.  So...  Yeah, but we don't even know what the pictures are.  I don't even know if people are supposed to be laughing.  I would ask questions.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  And I found myself in unknown locations.  I think he takes this very seriously.  Well, he's laughing as he does it.  I made specific gestures to make myself absolutely clear.  And these are stock pictures from my textbooks.  So he's telling a bizarre story.  And some of these situations that I found myself in became violent. 
[00:44:30]  I can be seen standing in the center with bandage around my head.  And he turned into a book.  And these are the illustrations that he's using the story.  And it's like pictures of a kid, like, from the 50s, one with no armor.  It's pretty funny.  Yeah, they're like those medical pictures where they black out the eyes.  Catch myself and ask questions like, 
[00:45:00]  who is being brushed?  Yeah, the pictures are really bizarre.  I've been visiting with the seal at the dock.  There's a man by a dock with a seal.  I think about when I will have a daughter.  Just a girl on a pig farm? 
[00:45:30]  What the fuck is that?  How beautiful she will be.  And she will know what it is.  And how it is done.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  It's going to get weird in here today.  See, the thing is, that's great, but Crispin Glover can't read that to you in your house.  No.  No.  So you have to read it.  And just picture him reading it.  Yeah.  It's impossible to watch him without thinking of George McFly. 
[00:46:00]  I literally forgot he was in that movie.  Oh, God.  I can't forget that.  I hardly remember that movie.  Roland, what's Crispin Glover all about?  Yeah.  Quickly.  And those laughs were put in there, obviously.  He's his own publicist.  No, that was in front of an audience.  That was in front of a crowd.  Yeah, but I...  No, I think that was a lot of uncomfortable art as this is supposed to be funny.  Are you sure?  Where was that from?  It almost looked like it was produced to be, you know, where they got people and said,  look, we want you to laugh here, here, and here.  I think it's a lot of like...  Those laughs were way too big for what he was doing.  No, I agree. 
[00:46:30]  That's why I think...  That's why this is really strange.  I think it was like, this is funny, right?  This is meant to be funny?  I don't know.  No, that's what I'm saying in the audience.  Yeah, no, I know.  Yeah.  And I'm sitting here going, I don't know.  Yeah, I don't know either, because I had to book him through him, because he's his own  publicist.  How'd you get his number?  Yeah, I know people.  You certainly do.  I think the laughs were authentic, because I think it's a very Andy Kaufman thing.  Yeah, sure.  And I appreciate what Andy Kaufman did.  He said to me, I just went, oh, thank you.  Oh, perfect.  I hung up.  I was like, what? 
[00:47:00]  I can't wait.  All right.  Wow.  Did you get a Cronut this morning?  No, Friday, I'm going to get them.  It was locked to Cronuts already.  I agree.  Sunscreen.  There was a thing that said Cronuts are very bad for you.  You think?  And the paper, very bad for you.  I can't wait until something really bad comes out about Cronuts, and that guy can't sell  his fucking shitty cock dessert anymore.  Right.  It's like the highest calorie.  Well, I mean, you know it's a big fat, and that's fine.  Of course it is.  I hope something bad happens, like there's a weird chemical combination, that when you 
[00:47:30]  eat them, you sterilize yourself.  Or Cronuts cause blood shitting.  Next.  That would please me.  Yeah, they cause the blood shits.  There's something with the sugar and combined with this.  The blood shits.  Yeah, but it's not on the toilet, it's only when you're standing on a ladder, you shit  blood.  He's close friends with Nicolas Cage.  Oh.  That doesn't surprise me.  What the fuck do those two talk about?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:48:00]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oh, yeah!  The seal at the dock.  Yeah!  Roland, can I go to this thing?  Yeah.  I would love to check this out.  Yeah, I'll ask him for...  Yeah, he invited, once he's there, he'll tell me...  So, so, so, I...  So, here is what it is.  This is what I've, so far...  You want the description?  It's a...  Well, we heard it.  We heard the description when...  Not really.  When Travis said...  There's an official description.  Did you read the whole... 
[00:48:30]  Yeah, of course I did.  About the horror film and all that?  Well, I think what you're going to see is Crispin Glover, live, in person.  Right.  The slideshow are the pictures...  Right.  ...that he's...  Yes.  ...referencing from the book.  And he tells these stories.  These are just old pictures from old books, by the way.  And pops up old pictures on the screen.  And that's what you'll be seeing?  And then his movie.  And then his movie, which is a movie of what?  Well, the movie, I think... 
[00:49:00]  It is fine.  Everything is fine.  Is that the movie?  Yes.  Okay.  And to my knowledge, that is the second movie of a trilogy.  Oh, shit.  Much like Back to the Future.  This is the description of the movie, I think.  Except he's in all three of them.  Although Paul's speech is unintelligible to us, each of the women he meets understands  exactly what he says.  They often find him wildly attractive.  This is Paul's fantasy, of course.  And what he is saying within it is painful, honest, awful, and makes It Is Fine, as much 
[00:49:30]  a psychological horror film as it is an exercise in midnight movie madness.  I don't get it.  What is it?  He's also saying...  I read an interview where he was asked, you know, like, what's the bad...  Who's the antagonist in It Is Fine?  And he's not one of those guys that likes, you know, to point out, you know, what is  bad.  He thinks that's very corporate and very, you know, like, that's the... 
[00:50:00]  The Hollywood wants you to know this is the bad thing and this is the good thing.  He doesn't do that.  All right.  It's going to be great.  All right.  Oh, before we go to break, we got a clip from Mr. Imus' show.  Oh, Mr. Imus.  Now, what does Mr. Imus say?  You're laughing, right?  I know.  I don't know what it is.  Well, for one lousy fucking day, I thought I was special. 
[00:50:30]  One lousy fucking day.  Oh, no.  One lousy day, the opester thought he was special.  I think I can guess what it is.  Turns out, oh, boy, I'm not special at all.  Not even close.  This, the cards.  What?  Shut up.  Why don't we just play the clip?  Please.  Okay.  Just keep that in mind.  For a day, I thought I was special.  So, I got back to the office here in New York. 
[00:51:00]  First time I went in the office was, I think, on Monday.  And there's a gift.  Oh, boy.  What's going on with Imus?  We haven't heard him in a while.  It gets worse.  Really?  I went back to the office.  There's a gift.  He needs air.  It's like he's, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, come on, Don.  A gift from Paul Anka.  Oh. 
[00:51:30]  Who was a guest on a program with his book.  Huh.  From a place called Gary's in Beverly Hills.  Paul, this devoted fan, who listens to me religiously, sent me a brandy decanter.  And also said, give my regards to Charles.  Oh.  And a set of four double old fashions. 
[00:52:00]  I just got the exact same fucking gift as me.  Exact same gift.  So, there was no thought in it.  It's the same thing.  It's the exact same fucking thing.  He got a bunch of these.  Which you would have got, too.  But you weren't here that day.  Yeah.  And he had them sent out to all the places that he's been pushing this book.  What an idiot I am.  Do you think the note's handwritten or someone writes it for him?  I'm betting that's his secretary.  All right.  Or for a copy machine.  I'm bringing the decanter in tomorrow. 
[00:52:30]  I'm fucking giving away.  Fuck Paul Anka.  Why would you give it away when you could smash it?  That's so hack.  You know what?  That's what somebody else wanted to do.  But it's hack when there's no reason to.  You have a reason now.  I really thought I got a special gift from Paul Anka with a handwritten note.  And it turns out he gave these things all over the place.  Why don't we analyze it?  Huh?  Do you want us to call Imus and see if you guys can talk about your gifts?  Sure.  What did he do wrong when you think about it?  He just gave two gifts to people. 
[00:53:00]  You guys aren't dating him.  It's the exact same gift.  Who cares?  He didn't buy you the same roses he bought Imus.  That's the same fucking gift.  And he probably got a whole bunch of them for other people that we don't even know about yet.  Yeah.  I don't feel special.  I want to feel special for one fucking day.  And a set of four double old fashions.  And know what's sad?  He's laughing at the gift. 
[00:53:30]  He's laughing at the gift.  I felt like fucking good.  He's laughing at the gift.  He's laughing at the gift thinking it's completely ridiculous.  I didn't think it was ridiculous when I opened mine.  Fuck yeah, man.  I laughed at mine too.  I felt great.  My cologne.  You got cologne.  I did.  Do you think maybe like fucking McGurk got some cologne?  No.  No?  No.  Why would you give McGurk a cologne?  Because he fucking sits in that weird little area like a fucking creature.  No.  Because we asked that.  Didn't we? 
[00:54:00]  We both asked for his cologne.  You got the cologne.  I didn't get the cologne.  I put everyone's name in the email.  This is who was in the studio that day.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The only reason I gave my address was because I was afraid if it went through corporate here  they would open it or something would fucking happen to it.  Yeah.  So he only sent one cologne to you?  Yeah.  Jesus.  Well, then the next day I get something for Kevin Pollock.  Kevin Pollock's got me a gift too.  That's a good imus, man.  Fuck, man. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, he's fucking wheezing, though.  You got to change your imus impression again.  It's like every month or so you got to change it a little.  What was he going through?  What kind of cancer did he have?  He had the prostate, right?  Oh, prostate.  Okay.  You think that's from the chemo or no?  Something's going...  No, I...  Last time...  Is he over it?  Look, man.  I think we said it already, so fuck it.  Last time I talked to imus off the air, he said he wasn't fucking going through the traditional  treatment.  Oh, okay.  He said he was just going to ride it out.  Yeah.  Didn't he say that?  I think you were there for that one, right? 
[00:55:00]  I'm sorry.  Maybe he changed his mind.  I don't know.  Yeah, because that's such a fucking...  That's what Steve Jobs did.  He went the natural route like an idiot, and he fucking...  He should be alive today.  He absolutely could have beaten that cancer.  All right.  But no Coke spoon?  Yeah, exactly right.  So I was going to bring it in.  Oh, yeah.  And smash it with a sledgehammer.  Oh, God.  But my wife wouldn't let me because...  Well, let me. 
[00:55:30]  Because I'm pussy whipped.  Do you know how funny it would be to see Imus smashing something with a sledgehammer on  V-Box business?  He wouldn't be able to lift it up over his shoulder.  How is he going to smash it?  Just an old...  He's just a jerk.  He is a jerk.  Why did he want to smash it?  Yeah, look.  There's a different reaction.  I felt like a million bucks that day.  Yeah.  And he right away knew it was a stupid fucking gift.  Did he have a bad appearance on Imus?  No, but later on in the clip, you'll hear... 
[00:56:00]  Oh, all right.  Let's keep going.  He knew...  He...  Well, let me.  She pointed out how dangerous it would be to smash a crystal to the camera and four  cheesy glasses with flying glass all over the studio.  And she's right.  Letting that do it.  That is pretty funny.  No, you should take him to the ranch and, like, use him for target practice.  Like, shoot a pistol at him.  That would be fun.  God, what a great idea.  Oh, man. 
[00:56:30]  That would be awesome.  They value me.  Like how I looked it up.  Wow.  He might really be my father.  This is exactly what you did.  He jokes about this.  Has over the years.  He might actually be my father.  He does the same shit.  Wow.  Huh?  He does another thing that you do.  Really?  Oh, my God.  This is so funny.  This is weird.  I love it.  That's why I pulled so much of it.  Oh.  Because I looked it up.  Or I'm begging to. 
[00:57:00]  It was $160.  So, um...  Had it been worth...  You don't say $1,000, which would have been appropriate.  But a cheesy, cheap, crummy crystal to counter for $160.  Which is not exactly what I had in mind.  But it does establish a precedent.  Yeah.  And that is, if you have a book, and you're appearing on the program, let's pony up a gift for the iMac. 
[00:57:30]  Wow.  But maybe it's something I might be able to use.  Way to go, Dad.  Way to go.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, shit.  A cheesy gift.  A thousand dollars would be appropriate.  Which would have been appropriate.  It makes me laugh.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Fuck.  Fuck.  That gift is useless.  Yep.  That's taking up space in my getting smaller apartment.  It's like spam.  His gift.  That's what you got.  You got something that he gave no thought to. 
[00:58:00]  Sent it out to everybody that he's done an appearance on.  I want to find out if there's anyone else.  You think, like, Scott Shannon has one?  He was on the show.  Yeah.  And did they get that crystal decanter?  Yeah, let's do this.  Who, like, that we could talk to?  Right.  Has he been on?  Check that out.  Someone look into that.  So I'll save the handwritten note, even though I don't believe that's even...  I want to thank Paul Anka for appearing on PMT TV, and especially for this wonderful crystal decanter. 
[00:58:30]  Me.  Fuck.  For one day, I was feeling good.  You thought he...  One lousy day.  You know what?  I liked that show.  I liked that guy.  Yeah.  We had a good time.  I'm going to get him a gift.  Yep.  No, it was send a gift out to every single...  No, no, no.  It was send the gift out.  Send the gift.  He had nothing to do with it.  Send the gift.  The gift that everyone gets.  He didn't even say that.  His people already know at this point that...  Oh, he probably has no idea.  ...that they have to send the gift after Paul Anka comes through. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  You'll be...  Hey, Paul, thank you for the decanter.  What?  I bet she doesn't even know.  Yeah.  The second appearance, the gift goes up.  Yeah.  His peeps.  Fuck.  He's just a classy guy.  That's an old school thing to do.  It's not classy if it's only 160 bucks.  Well, yeah, but...  It makes a great point.  It's a little something.  It looked like it was way more expensive.  I started getting bummed out when we did look up the price.  Yeah, I thought it was going to be a lot more.  I was thinking $400 or $500, and... 
[00:59:30]  Well, my friend...  I saw the price, too.  Kevin Pollack's was more expensive.  $400, yeah.  My friend works for Tiffany's, and she had texted me and said, that's the most basic,  fucking thoughtless gift you can give.  What, the Tiffany one from Kevin Pollack?  Uh, oh, is that from Kevin?  Oh, no, no, no.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Jimmy, you just threw Kevin Pollack under the bus.  Look, this is the best day ever.  I'm bringing in these shitty gifts tomorrow. 
[01:00:00]  I'll give them to the listeners.  They probably have a wedding they have to go to soon.  I don't have a tear.  Both gifts are being given away tomorrow.  But Kevin's a fan of the show.  He's sincere.  Sorry, Kevin.  I thought that was the other one.  The most insincere garbage gift you could give.  Oh, Kevin.  Oh, Kevin.  He's, like, such a good guy.  He's a great guy.  We almost sent Kevin Pollack to his death. 
[01:00:30]  Remember last week when he was playing Helium Comedy Club in Philly?  Yes.  And he asked us what he could do in Philly, and I know Philly a little bit,  enough to suggest a place for him to go, and I said, is it Muter or Mutter?  Mutter, I think.  The Mutter Museum, that really strange museum with fucking medical oddities and all that?  Yeah.  Well, the building that collapsed in Philly yesterday is right next to the Mutter Museum.  Oh, boy.  Right next to it.  It's the Muter Museum, Opie. 
[01:01:00]  Is it Mutter?  I don't know.  It says Mutter.  I heard, like, it pronounced Mutter.  I've always said Muter, too, but...  Yeah, I know.  It seems like it would be pronounced Mutter.  No, it's the Muter Museum.  So they got some things over the U that make it a Muter instead of a Mutter?  Can you look up the Muter Museum?  Them things over there.  A couple of those dots.  Them things.  What?  Is that called an umlaut?  Yes, there is an umlaut over the U.  They do have two dots.  An umlaut.  And what does that mean?  It's a harder U.  Is that hard?  If it was Mutter, it would be M-U...  What is it?  M-U-E or something? 
[01:01:30]  M-U...  How do you spell it, Travis?  M-U-T-T-E-R.  Oh, it is spelled M-U-T-E-R, but I think the umlaut makes it a U.  E-E.  Otherwise, it would just be M-U-T-E-R.  M-U-T-E-R was a M-U-T-E-R.  Yeah.  My father was a M-U-T-E-R.  Go ahead.  I would rather it be M-U-T-E-R.  It is M-U-T-E-R.  Okay.  M-U-T-E-R it is.  Yeah.  Let's go with M-U-T-E-R.  That's what you do for girls talking.  Yeah.  You're M-U-T-E-R.  But I guess the building that collapsed was right next door to this thing.  Oh.  So, medicine and the macabre. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  They found some older dude trapped.  61-year-old guy.  They got out of there.  Late last night, I think.  M-U-T-E-R.  M-U-T-E-R.  What?  M-U-T.  So, it's U-T.  M-U-T-E-R.  This story calls it the M-U-T-E-R Museum.  M-U-T-E-R.  What an awful sentence.  The M-U-T-E-R Museum.  M-U-T-E-R.  So, we're both wrong.  M-U-T-E-R.  M-U-T-E-R.  Just put two fucking O's there.  M-U-T-E-R-E-R. 
[01:02:30]  M-U-T-E-R.  Yeah, why not just O-O.  Stop.  Hello, M-U-T-E-R.  Hello, father.  M-U-T-E-R.  Tell your children not to walk my way.  Fuck you.  Fuck your M-U-T-E-R.  M-U-T-E-R.  M-U-T-E-R, do you think they'll drop the bomb?  M-U-T-E-R-E-R-E-R.  M-U-T-E-R-E.  I hate the way that sounds. 
[01:03:00]  I'd rather it be M-U-T-E-R-E-R-E-R.  M-U-T-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R-E-R.  What's your price?  All right, let's take a break.  Oh, we got to eat.  Maybe Jay Moore today.  Definitely Crispin Glover.  Oh, we didn't announce the other guests.  Oh.  I knew there was something.  Rob Delaney, and we didn't mention that Vince Vaughn's calling it.  Yeah.  Oh!  That's pretty cool.  We have a mutual friend, a comedian named Steve Byrne.  Who, yeah.  He's a good dude. 
[01:03:30]  And he got injured, so I want to see if he's all right.  What do you mean he got injured?  I think he got injured.  He's hurt.  Huh?  He got injured.  What do you mean he got injured?  Hurt.  No, I mean, I'm thinking if I should say it.  Oh, oh.  I think he got hurt, but I'm not sure if I should say it.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Okay.  And don't forget, episode four of the Opie and Anthony podcast available.  Doing very well.  We have the Baby Bird Saga on this week's podcast, and it seems like people are digging it. 
[01:04:00]  So, and who else?  Courtney Love and the Otto and George thing, which is hilarious.  Is there a nugget?  An Opie and Anthony nugget?  Yes, there is, sir.  You shouldn't call it a nugget.  You should call it a nouget.  Yeah, a nugget.  Or a nugget with the two dots over the fucking nugget.  Yeah.  And every day I have to deal with tweets from people going, what's the app you use?

[01:17:00]  In the war  Against the black man  In the white house  Shut the fuck up  This strategy  Is nothing new  And it was explained  Way back in 1981  By Lee Atwater  Who was Bush 41's  Chief strategist  In a tape recording  Mr. Atwater revealed  How Republicans  Evolve their language  To achieve the same purpose  He said  You start out  In 1954  By saying  N word  N word  N word  N word  By 1968  You can't say N word  That hurts you 
[01:17:30]  Backfires  So you say stuff like  Forced busing  States rights  And all that stuff  And you're getting  So abstract  Now you're talking  About cutting taxes  We want to cut  This is much more  Abstract  Than even the busing  Thing  And have a hell of a lot  More abstract  Than N word  N word  So this afternoon  We welcome  The latest phrase  In the lexicon  Of republican  Attacks  On this president  The IRS  Three letters  That sound so innocent 
[01:18:00]  But we know  What you mean  You're so fucking  Far-fetched  They fucking  The IRS  Was doing this  You dumb  Fucking  IRS  They were  But that  He didn't  The way he said  That is  He didn't say  What they said  He said  He didn't say  What they said  He's saying  That IRS  Is just another  Code word  That the republicans  Are using  Like when they say  Force busing  And things like that  That just mean nigger  No no but I mean  Saying the way  It was written up  It made it look like 
[01:18:30]  He actually  Just because  Said the IRS  Is the new nigger  But he didn't  I mean the way  He phrased it  Right  Was from a train  Of thought  Nowhere near  What they said  They're completely  Far-fetched  And I think  He's misquoting  He could be  Misquoting  Atwater because  Like not misquoting  But misquoting  His intention  Like was he saying  This is what  We're creating  You can't say  Nigger nigger anymore  So you gotta say  Or was he just  Kind of saying  That's the logical  Progression of how  Things happen  Right  But his point  Is completely  Ridiculous anyway  Because it's not 
[01:19:00]  Like they make  They're making  Things up  It's been  Acknowledged  Yes the IRS  Did target  Conservative groups  When these groups  Would go for  A tax exempt status  They let through  Liberal groups  Without any issue  And conservative groups  Had to wait  Put them on these  Endless waiting lists  Ask them questions  That they never asked  The liberal groups  Things like this  So it's not like  This didn't happen 
[01:19:30]  And they're trying  To make a new  Way to save  It's ridiculous  And as far as  Being an attack  On the president  And no evidence  Linking it to the  White House  Sure  At this point  Right now  There isn't  But the  White House  Is the leadership  And that is  What is supposed  To make sure  Things like this  Don't happen  It wasn't a  Rogue IRS agent  This was a  Concerted effort  By the  Internal Revenue  Service to  Fuck with 
[01:20:00]  Conservative groups  And as the  President  Regardless if it  Goes right up to you  And has your  Signature on it  Or not  You're the guy  Responsible  And that's something  That this White  House and  President have  Amazingly steered  Clear of every  Controversy  And scandal  And cover ups  If you want to  Talk about that  With Benghazi  They're amazing  At doing that  Look at this  Fucking  How  How does  Fucking  Holder still  Have a job  How did this  Fucking rice 
[01:20:30]  Get appointed  Head of the  Fucking  President's  The  Head of security  National security  This is  Unbelievable  You think Eric  Holder  Keeps his job  Yeah  Cause he's black  But how does  Eric  Cause he's black  Eric Holder  Is a fucking  Snake  Yeah  He's a snake  I believe  He's perjured  Himself  And you know  But  But  Because  They're black 
[01:21:00]  This will not  Fucking affect them  You can't  Jump on them  Because  You get people  Like this  Asshole  That then  Brings the  Race  Fucking  Angle  Into it  Which has  Nothing  The IRS  Scandal  Has  Nothing  To do  With race  Nothing  That is  Really enraging  That  The president  Is involved  In scandal  Like  Every  Fucking  President  Winds up in  Yes  And this  Cunt  Martin  And he is a  Cunt  Oh sure  Makes it look like 
[01:21:30]  It's because  There's a black  Man  And the white  Like  Are you  You  First of all  You're not even  From here  You fuck  You don't  Don't act like  You understand  All the intricacies  Of the fucking  Of racial dynamics  Here you  Twat  Please  You twat  They  Any time  You disagree  With this  President  And his  Policies  It will  Always come  Back  Somebody will  Always tag  It as  You're being  Racist  You are  You don't  Like the fact  That there's a  Black man  In the  White house  They never 
[01:22:00]  Just say  Well  That guy  I guess  Doesn't agree  With his  Policies  He thinks  They're bad  For the  Country  But no  They always  Want to pull  The fucking  Race card  Out when  They don't  Have an  Argument  On the  Other side  And that  Way  It cuts  The argument  It turns  It into  Something else  Now you  Can't discuss  The issue  Because obviously  You're a  Racist  If you discuss  It  So  Yeah  He's an  Asshole  Where is he  From England  Great  Time they're  Having over  There with  Their fucking  Racial diversity  But that's  The thinking  Over there 
[01:22:30]  That's the  Thinking  What he just  Said  This fucking  Irrational  They're worse  There than we  Are here  With being  Terrible  They're the  Worst  The first  Thing that  Fucking  Twat  What's his  Name  Cameron says  Oh you  Know it's  Not all  Muslims  Shut up  Yeah  Who cares  If it is  They're the  Ones identifying  Themselves as  Doing it  For fucking  Islam  Yeah  They act like  The rest of  Us are going  It's Islam  You know why  We say it's  Islam  Because they  Say it  Why did you  Do that  Islam

No  Wait, where are you from originally?  I grew up in Boston  But I did  I went to NYU  But I've lived in L.A. for the last 12 years  Oh, shit  Okay  What'd you major in?  Musical theater  Can you sing?  Oh, yeah  Yeah  I don't know  But yeah, no, I really did  And I know people hear that now  And they're like, for real?  And I just did  That's what I studied  Except my senior year  I started going to see comedy  And I was like  I don't want to do musical theater anymore 
[01:39:00]  But then I started to get jobs  In musical theater  But then I was in a big car accident  And when I got out of that  I was like, I'm just going to do comedy  Really?  Mm-hmm  How bad was the car accident?  Real bad  I drove into a building  I drove into the Department of Water and Power  In L.A.  Very fast  Probably a stout building  Yeah  That sounds like, you know  It's not like the little pigs  It wasn't like a pop-up concert hut  Yeah, yeah  It was an actual stone  Wow  There was mortar  Yeah  So I drove into it  And  Why? 
[01:39:30]  I was drunk  I don't remember doing it  I was in a blackout  And  I got sober right after that  I had been trying to quit drinking for years  And then I did that  And I was like  I'm going to get sober  And then after I got out of jail  And hospital  And wheelchair  I was like  I'm going to do  Wait, jail and hospital  And wheelchair  What were the injuries?  I broke both my arms pretty badly  And my legs  They weren't broken  But they were in like  These leg things  I couldn't bend my knees  Because they did  Surgery on them as well  And so  Yeah, it was a mess  I was in jail in a wheelchair 
[01:40:00]  Covered in blood  My penis and testicles  Would expose themselves  Periodically in jail  When I slid out of my wheelchair  Oh boy  And  Yeah, but then once I got better  I said  Oh wow, I'm alive  Because it was sort of a surprise  Then I decided to start doing stand-up  How long were you in jail for?  Not long at all  Not even 24 hours  Oh, okay  Because they were like  But I  Then I had a court date  And the judge said  How was jail?  Do you like it?  And I said  I didn't care for it  He said  Because you have to go back  Or you can go to a  Halfway house  And rehab  And all that stuff 
[01:40:30]  And I said  I'll do that  So for four and a half months  That's where I lived  Per the state of California's orders  And it was great  I actually enjoyed it a lot  How long ago is this now?  11 years ago  Oh wow  Yeah, so it's a ways back  Did you have fun at least the night?  I did  I totally did  As long as you got that  I remember the night too  I remember there was a girl named Juna  At this party  That's a fun name  And I was like  I like you  And then she was like 
[01:41:00]  Well just go stand in that corner  And I was like  Okay  And I remember I had a big glide  Like a solo cup  Like having a keg party  And we drank all the beer  Then I like drank all the wine  And then I took a bottle of bourbon  And a bottle of vodka  And I just poured it up to the top  Which if you don't drink  I'll just tell you  That's not actually a drink  That's not a cocktail  And I drank that all the way down  And then I remember  Halfway through my second one  My brain just turned off  Yeah  But my body didn't  My body was like  No, we should still party  That's bad  Anyway, that was all a long time ago 
[01:41:30]  And I'm glad that it happened  Because it led to  Me being here with you guys  Yeah, we're just getting to know you  Black eyes are amazing  One other question  Did they ever tell you  How fast they think you were going  When you hit the building?  You know  I have a pretty detailed police report  That I'll pull out  Whenever I like move  Or whatever  And I'll find it  I don't think I was going  Ridiculously fast, honestly  But you know what?  I do know  I took out  Three parking meters  And two trees  On the way into the building  So it had to be  So it wasn't like 
[01:42:00]  First gear  30,000 pounds of bananas  By Harry Chapin  You hear that song  When he describes the wreck?  Yeah  Wow, that's a fucking  Great blackout story, man  People wake up  They have no idea  What the fuck happened to them  The worst  Just the worst  And you always  And you always knew  You wanted to do stand-up  Yeah, well  I didn't  I mean, I always loved comedy  As a kid  And we'd listen to Cosby albums  On road trips  With my family and stuff  But it was my senior year  In college  When I started to attend comedy  And be around comedians  And feel them  And smell them  And feel the contours 
[01:42:30]  Of their body  Then I knew  That I was like  I gotta do this  This is it  Because acting is fine  But you're saying things  That other people wrote  And then once you  Produce laughter  Out of other people's bodies  With things that you thought up  That's it forever  I mean, that's it  Until you die  Whether it's next week  Or in, you know, a hundred years  Right  So musical theater  Like you  You know, like Nathan  I was just thinking today  Like Nathan Lane  It's really hard to make a living  It seems  Or be a star  Purely from doing that 
[01:43:00]  Oh God, yeah  He's one of the only guys  That seems to be  Like a national name  Who just makes his life  Well, fucking Ferris Bueller's  Doing a pretty good job too  Yeah, yeah, yeah  He's just out there  Oh, Broderick  Yeah, yeah, yeah  He's just out there  Doing a lot of  Song and dance  Yeah, song and dance  Yeah, yeah  But he was a movie star first though  Like, I mean  Didn't  Well, he was a kid, yeah  Yeah, we knew him already  From Glory and  Yeah  Incredible  It's funny, you know  On the plane here yesterday  I watched Hugh Jackman  Was on Inside the Actors Studio  And it was like 50%  I was like  Shut your fucking mouth 
[01:43:30]  Like the most annoying  Like if you can imagine  Like a  If you can imagine  Like a 17 year old girl  Being like  I'm nuts about musicals  Like that  He was 50% that  But then 50%  Like so inspiring  That I was like  Almost crying on the plane  Like every other thing  He'd say  I'd be like  You just fucking  Should get hit by a car  And then the other time  I'd be like  I love you, Hugh  Like it was the weirdest  Dichotomy  I've never felt that way  About a person  It must be love  I think I'm in love  With Hugh Jackman  He is one of those people  That's just like 
[01:44:00]  Two different people  I hadn't known him  From anything before  You know  X-Men  Wolverine  Other than a similar lifestyle  So you see that  And it was like  Fuck this guy  Is badass  Yeah  And then it's like  Here he is  At the Tonys  Yeah yeah  And I'm looking  Going  Hey who the fuck  Is that  Yeah yeah yeah  Come on  Same guy  Crazy  He's like skinny  And he's  Eh  Hey guy  Very questionable  On the sexuality portion  Of it when I saw that  Well you know  I think he's just  I think he's probably 
[01:44:30]  Just sexually more evolved  Than anybody  He's like  Well I'll fuck it  And I'll fuck it good  Whatever it is  Probably  You know  And I'll do it well  It's true renaissance  So I salute him  Yes  It leads us to the  The board game  Yeah  What  Is that what you're promoting  Besides the stand up gig  At Caroline's  Yeah  Good for you  You know  And I know it's insane  But a few months ago  A board game company  Approached me  Because I write a lot of jokes  On Twitter  And I've written like  15,000 of them by now  And  You're great on Twitter  Thank you very much 
[01:45:00]  It has to be said publicly  Thank you  Yeah  You're one of the good ones man  I have a sickness  Where I need  If I'm not on stage  I have to be like  Like jerking off  On my phone screen  Trying to make people laugh  And so  I  Or writing jokes on it  And the  The board game company  Broached me and said  Hey could we make a game  Out of your tweets  And I was like  I've never said yes faster  Because  I love  If you think about  Like obviously  We all love comedy  But like  If you're like  Playing game night  And stuff  Like  You can like  Throw up from laughing  If you're playing  Like with your relative  I mean you get in a fist fight  Like 
[01:45:30]  It's such an awesome experience  So the idea that  Any of my jokes  Could be even peripherally  Involved with like  Something like that  I said  I was so excited  Yeah  What is the  Can we  I have not  I briefly took the board out  Before  But you gotta explain  The board game  There was a picture  There was a picture of you  In your Twitter photo  Yeah  An upsetting image  Which is the green  Yeah actually  The fucking awful  Green bathing suit  Yeah  Which highlights  Rob's cock  You can tell  That I'm circumcised  Which is such a bummer 
[01:46:00]  I have two sons  And we didn't circumcise them  And I see their  Cute little penises  When I change their diapers  And I envy them  I feel the same way man  Yeah my parents  Cut off half my dick  And threw in the garbage  I want it back  I fucking  I'm kind of annoyed  That I'm clipped  Yeah you'd probably be pissed  Than if you were  You know  The foreskin's always greener  You're probably thinking like  You know  If you were  In circumcised  You'd be like  Yeah  It's supposed to be better  As long as you keep it clean  And shit  It's supposed to be fucking better  Like I hate the fact that  The head of my cock  Is all exposed 
[01:46:30]  I would love to have  A nice sheath  Covered it  Really?  You're not going into battle  With it  No I know  But you've seen  The way I use it  Then we could dock  And everything  Yes  It's very hard to dock  The reason I asked this  And I wanted to wait  Until you hear  Is because I took it out  It's called  War of Words  Yep  But there's these weird little  Okay those are the game pieces  Oh they are  Okay  And since we're on  Radio  I'll say  The game pieces  We've got a van  That says  SS butt toucher  On it  We've got a nice wizard hat 
[01:47:00]  A ham sandwich  A cup of coffee  And an alarm clock  That says it's 420  With a marijuana leaf  And a big red circle  With a slasher  Now do they consult you on this  Or do they just make it?  Yeah those were my choices  In fact  Those game pieces  Oh  So they said  You deleted a part of it  Yeah  So I was involved  Like I would do test plays  And stuff  I mean all the  All the jokes in it are mine  But the scaffolding  Or the skeleton of it  Was designed by people  Who actually know  How to make games  And not by an idiot  Me 
[01:47:30]  But yeah  Basically you just roll a dice  And depending on what you roll  It decides if you're going to  Have to finish a joke of mine  If you're going to have to  Try to one up it  Or tag it or whatever  And things like that  So  And there's a subjective element  Where the people watching  Or playing with you  Can be like  Yeah no  Rick's was better  Even if it wasn't  You can just be like  Fuck you  I prefer Rick  So that's what  The good stuff  So if you're playing with your mom  Or whatever  You know  She might wind up slapping you  Because you picked your Aunt Susie  Instead of her  And to me  That's a game  Yeah  And then you punch your mom  And any game 
[01:48:00]  Where you're not punching your mom  Is a shitty game  That's why  Have you ever heard of Candyland?  You haven't right?  That's because you don't punch your mom  When you play  That's an old classic  Anyway  Shoots and ladders  I love shoots and ladders  Oh drat  Poop shoots and ladders  You got it  Yep  Maybe  Pork cheesy  Who hasn't called their grandmother  A cunt over a game of pork cheesy  I wish I could say I hadn't  So okay  There's three different colors  Okay  So people will land on a joke  And then have to finish it  Yeah  And then the cool part is  There's just a fat deck of my cards 
[01:48:30]  Which you could even just take  Into the toilet  And read  You know  There's three jokes per page  And  Or I guess card  A card is like a tiny page  Yes it is  That's  Wow that's a lot of jokes  Yeah there's a lot of jokes  A lot of goddamn jokes  Oh man  Fuck  A board game  That's very basic  Somebody sent me on Twitter  They were like  The only  Somebody was like  I've been trying  They were like  First of all  Fuck you for making a board game  And I said  You're correct  Fuck me  Why did I do that  And then  They said  The only other comedian I could find  Who did that  Was Rodney Dangerfield 
[01:49:00]  And so  You know  That'll work  You're in good company  Yeah  What was this board game  Was it like  I don't get no respect  Yeah no respect  The show is called  Get no respect  Yeah  By Milton Bradley  Milton Bradley  Play the Rodney Dangerfield game  See if you can get respect  From your boss  Exactly  I landed on Dr. Vinnie Bombat  Yeah  Oh there it is  Is there a commercial for it  And of course it's called  No Respect  It had to be 
[01:49:30]  No Respect  His album  He had a double album  Which was very funny  It was called  No Respect  And Son of No Respect  Were the two  Records on it  Masterpieces  Really  Fucking masterpieces  Our claim to fame  We got Rodney High  Wow  Yep  Back at WNEW  All right  A guy that works here  For another radio show  Stinky  Would bring our guests  Into the stairwell  And Rodney  Partook that day  His albums  His albums you can just  Listen to right now  In 2013 
[01:50:00]  And they would just  Lacerate anything else  Just so amazing  We went and saw him  He performed at  Avery Fisher Hall  And what did we have  In 2001 or something  Somewhere around there  And me and Florentine  Went just to be  In the same room with him  Because he was  At that point  Remember he was like  It was hard to understand  Because he smoked a lot of dope  He was starting to slow down  Yeah he was starting to slow down  But fucking just seeing him  In that room  And watching him  You're like  It's Rodney  You should have him on again  I heard a story  His wife started feeding him  The jokes  Oh he was 
[01:50:30]  And threw an earpiece  And he was still killing it  Because he was at a point  Where he wasn't remembering  His shit anymore  So she would read him off stage  And he would fucking perform  Yeah I heard that too  That he would walk in the pool  In Vegas  And just do his act  Back and forth in the pool  I guess at that age  His mind was just going  Right  In his 80s  So hot every day  He had a great ride  My wife and I  Saw Cosby recently live  Amazing  Where'd you say him  Still amazing huh  Yeah he was  He wasn't like  Like a samurai sword anymore 
[01:51:00]  But he's still very very good  He did two hours  In those two hours  He did six jokes  I'm not joking  They were each about  20 minutes in length  And what he does  Is he just tells an amazing  Ridiculously detail rich story  And at the end  He just grabs your neck  And fucking snaps it  As he ties it all together  In a way that nobody  Before or since  Fucking ever did  Just amazing  He made me listen to him  Talk about skiing  For 40 minutes  That was one of his bits  When I was growing up  Yeah  Just about skiing  With a million fucking jokes  In there  Just unbelievable 
[01:51:30]  Great storyteller  I saw him with my ex  Actually in Atlantic City  And we watched him  And he opened up  The story he opened  Was doing okay  You could tell it was new  Like this is a comic  He was feeling it out  Opened with it  And then it was  It was going well  He was having like a six  But then he just went  To the next one  And started murdering  And you're like  Oh he can get a laugh  Whenever he really wants to  Like whenever  He's not getting a laugh  It's because he's probably  Experimenting with something  But when he wants a laugh  And goes okay  It's time now to turn it up 
[01:52:00]  It was fucking effortless  You know what I was struck by  In this show  That we just very recently saw  Was he wore sweatpants  The grossest sandals  Over socks  And like a graphic t-shirt  Tucked in  And he just goes out  And like clips the mic  On his shirt  And sits down  Like your slobbiest grandfather  Like your grandfather's friend  Would come over  And you'd be like  Fuck why is he here  And then just killed everybody  It was amazing  That's right  He walks out  And just clips on his mic  Isn't there no intro or something  He just walks on stage  Just walks right out 
[01:52:30]  And we got to meet him afterwards  We got to  Did you talk to him?  I was fortunate to be able to do that  He fucking receives people  I met him briefly  And got a photo with him  So I got him to sign it  I didn't think he'd invite  He didn't remember me  But they brought us back  And he just sat me and my girlfriend  In his dressing room  And talked to us for about 20 minutes  And then other people were coming in  And you know  Because I was a comic  He's like  No no no stay stay stay  Like he seemed like  He wanted somebody else there  Because he had to talk to these  Fucking business people  But it was weird  That's cool  He listens  Like he asks you questions 
[01:53:00]  Yeah  He asked my wife  He knew  My wife grew up in North Carolina  He knew way more about North Carolina  Than she did  He just was  It was amazing  Yeah he cared  And listened  And it made me realize  And you know what he said to me  He goes  He's like  Well you know  He's like  You've got a very beautiful wife  He goes  Just make sure  You keep her the higher priority  Over your comedy  And then you'll be better at comedy  He's like  You have her be priority number one  And your kids  And then way off in the distance  You can barely see it  Is your comedy career  And I was like 
[01:53:30]  Okay  And I sort of laughed a little bit  He goes  Don't laugh  Oh shit  And he was like  He made me say it out loud  That I would keep my family  Above my comedy career  And it was kind of like  I would have power chills  Yeah  And then now my wife lives with him  Which  Yeah that's  I think that's why he's a great comic  Because he listens well  Yeah  He observes everything  And that's why he tells the story well  Because he fucking is a sponge  Like he just soaks in information  And you have no idea  When he's going to use it  He's probably on stage now  Talking about me 
[01:54:00]  No doubt  But he was a terrible comic  Awful Cosby impression  I like the fact that your game  Doesn't have batteries  Or a Pop-O-Matic  Or anything  Yeah  It is in that sense  And if you like Trivial Pursuit  You'll notice the box  It's kind of the same shape  Yeah  A little square thing  A big thick square  It's not your traditional  Monopoly long box  No more Cubel  Has he sold  You know it has started to 
[01:54:30]  It's exclusively through Amazon right now  And I'm told that what they do  Is they figure out  All their weird algorithms and stuff  And then like a few weeks  After it's out  Which it just came out  Then they'll start to sell it  So more  You plug it on Twitter  Yeah  And frankly  I hope people buy it  But if they don't  I still got a game  You know what I mean  Yeah  I wasn't like  Oh I hope I make money  On a board game  I'm not a crazy person  I was just like  It's an honor to have it  It's so cool  I hope people play it  And people write me  And say that they are playing it  So I'm good  Great  It is pretty cool  To have a game 
[01:55:00]  You know  Yeah  Are you the only one  On Twitter  That doesn't have haters  Oh I have so many haters  So many visceral  I mean hatred  That could power a city  Yeah  It's amazing  Now most people  And more than 50% of people  Are nice, kind, funny  Exactly  Like I'll do a joke  And then they'll write something  Back to me  That's like 10 times funnier  So I feel good  About humanity  Generally because of Twitter  But still  Because of the number  Of followers that I have  The number of people  Who hate me  And want me to die  Are very high and big  And it's a robust organization 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, yeah  The  Boy  And they just  Wait  What is the problem  They have  What is the problem  They have  With you  Why  Oh  Last night  Somebody wrote me  Somebody wrote me  And they said  What would you do  If you were at a  If you were  Doing an open mic  And every comic  Before you  Was a misogynist  And I wrote back  I was like  I would  I would get up  And I would take a deep breath  From on a stage  And I would lacerate them 
[01:56:00]  In a fun and funny way  And  Because  That'd be a shitty  Boring show  You know  And then I just talked about  How I think  Like  You know  I think women are  Filthy  And dynamic  Just like men  And I think  If something isn't funny  If it's funny to a group of men  And it's not funny to a group of women  It's probably not as funny  As it could be  It's like egalitarian  You want to be  Like  Like Pryor or Carlin  Would be fucking outrageous  And women would be like  Yay  And so I think  You know  So I wrote that  And then people would be  Wrote me back  And were like 
[01:56:30]  Fucking  Faggot  You know  And like  I'd be like  They've gotta be kidding  And then I'd look  And they totally weren't  And I'd be like  Like how dare you  You know  And just ridiculous  So  But the thing is  You can find  We live in an amazing world  And the internet allows you  To connect to all these people  You can focus on the scumbags  Of which there are  Myriad  Or you can focus on the good people  I try to do that more  Cause yeah  There will always be  Garbage people  But fuck them  They can choke to death  I think it's pretty accurate 
[01:57:00]  Depiction of society  Yeah  Yeah you look at the numbers  And think like  Yeah I bet there's that many  Scumbags per good person  Totally  Out there  And how many followers  You got now  Like 850,000  Heading toward a mill  850,000  You're about to  Yeah  It's a funny account too  It really is rare  That I read Twitter  And laugh out loud  But there's been a few things  You've written  That I was like  Fucking  Like  That I just laughed  And you know  I don't laugh out loud  Of tweets ever 
[01:57:30]  But fuck man  And your avatar  Is just famous now  It's disgusting  It's just famous  You can't change that one  Well  That damn avatar  Pops up everywhere  Well that's the thing  People  A lot of guys  Will write me and be like  Hey I want to follow you  But I ain't looking  At that fucking picture  And I'll be like  And I'll be like  Then you'll never follow me  I mean the more people  Hate it  The harder I affix it  To my profile  I never understood that  So I ain't fucking  Like there'd be  A funny video  You want to put a link to  From YouTube  Or something like that 
[01:58:00]  And you know  There might be something  Maybe a little  Homoerotic  At the beginning  But the payoff is there  It's something  And it's like  Dude I made it  Through two seconds  To that  I think I watched  That fucking  Homo shit  Wow  And you're like  I don't have mirrors  In my own bathroom  I don't want to see  My own penis  It's like you're  Missing out  On something  That has nothing  To do with you  Being a faggot  Don't worry 
[01:58:30]  Oh boy  Don't worry  Doesn't that seem  Exhausting  To live that way  Yeah  I can do it  With black people  We all have our crosses  To burn  To burn  Yes  Is Crispin here  Yeah we got  Crispin Glover  Oh my god  I can't even believe  He's right outside the studio  What's up Crispin  He looks great  He looks like a professor  Should we just bring him in  We should have a break  Should we break  We should take a single

[02:00:30]  Thank you  Great to have you  I've been a fan for many years  I appreciate it  Yeah  And we were going through  Your new project  That you're working on  Is this  It is fine  Everything is fine  Well I'm playing  Two different films  Tomorrow night  I'm on a tour  Around the U.S.  Right now  People can find out  Where I am  On Crispin Glover  Dotcom  But I have two  Feature films  I've actually been touring  Since the year 2005  Really  I premiered  What is it  The part one  Of what will be  A trilogy  In 2005 
[02:01:00]  At Sundance  And then  It is fine  Everything is fine  I premiered  In 2007  Sundance  I'm playing both of them  Tomorrow and the next day  Here in New York  At the Museum of Arts  And Design  And I also perform  A live show  Before the  Two feature films  I have two different  Live shows  I feel naked  Because normally  I have my books  With me  Right  And I fail to have them  But they're profusely  Illustrated  Books 
[02:01:30]  I'm very proud of them  The illustrations  Every page  Is projected  Behind me  As I perform  An hour long show  Then I show the film  What is it  Is 72 minutes  Or if I'm showing it  Everything is fine  That's 74 minutes  After the film  I come out  I have a Q&A  With the audience  And then after that  I have a book signing  So it's a long show  It's a little bit  I'm a bit hoarse  I'm in the midst  Of touring  Are the books serious  Or are they comedic  Or  They're old books  Taken from the 1800s 
[02:02:00]  That are reworked  And turned into  Different books  From what they  Originally were  They're very heavily  Illustrated  There's humor  There's humor in the shows  But it's not  It's not like  Comedy  People laugh  And things  But yeah  I've been  The first time  I ever performed  The live show  Is in 93  So I guess  Gosh  That's 20 years ago  Wow  I just realized  That I can't even  Believe it  So you took books  From the 1800s  And kind of updated  Them and made them  I don't know  If update's the right word  But I made them  Into their own things  From what they were  Obviously we were 
[02:02:30]  Watching the  You have a little story  That goes along  With the pictures  Now you have  These books  You look at these pictures  And then come up with  Some kind of storyline  For the pictures  Yes  I mean different books  Came in different ways  I made about 20 of them  Over the years  Most of these are old  Most of them were done  In the 80s and 90s  And I've utilized it  As a way to  Tour with my films  To self distribute  The films  And I have recouped  On the films  But really the way 
[02:03:00]  I've recouped  Is 50% by the live show  25% by the box office  From the films  And 25% by the book sales  But it's worked  It gives a live aspect  To just watching a movie  Now they get to see you live  Have a Q&A  Yeah  And I have a genuine  Interaction with the audience  And people come back  I've had many people  Come back for many shows  Over the years  So I have a  Genuine relationship  With the audience  The first film  What is it  I usually play 
[02:03:30]  The second film first  For various reasons  But the first film  What is it  Most of the actors  Have Down syndrome  But the film  Isn't about Down syndrome  At all  What it really is  Is my psychological reaction  To the corporate constraints  That have happened  In the last 30 years  Of corporately funded  And distributed filmmaking  Where anything  Anything that can possibly  Make an audience member  Uncomfortable  Is necessarily excised  Or that film  Will not be corporately funded  Or distributed  Oh my god  I think that's  It's a very damaging thing  For that to happen  Because it's those moments  When an audience member 
[02:04:00]  Looks up at the screen  And thinks to themselves  Is this right what I'm watching  Is this wrong what I'm watching  Should I be here  Should the filmmaker  Have done this  What is it  And that's the title  Of the first film  What is it that's taboo  In the culture  What does it mean  When the taboo  Has been ubiquitously excised  I think it's very damaging  Because when people  Are asking questions  In the etymological term  Of education  Meaning to learn from within  There's real education  Going on  And instead I feel  Like what's happening  In our corporately funded  And distributed film industry  Is there are not questions  And what's the opposite 
[02:04:30]  Of education  It's more indoctrination  It's propaganda  Yeah  Well let me ask you  That's an interesting point  Of view too  About what's  Making people  Uncomfortable  There's been a raging  Controversy  With what is appropriate  In comedy  Like to make fun of  Whether it's racism  Or rape  Or anything  Do you think  There's anything  That people shouldn't  Make fun of in comedy  Or do you think  It's all fair  Well it is a complicated issue  And my film deals  With some of those  Issues in different ways  As well  Ultimately  I think of it more  Having to do with acting 
[02:05:00]  Where you know  It's inappropriate  For one person  To play another  Kind of person  And it's understandable  Because there  There has been  A terrible history  Which can really be  Lead to horrible things  But I mean  Ultimately  I believe  Everybody should be  Able to play everybody  But you know  I mean  Art is complex  You could say  You could say  That the most horrendous  Things are still  Artful  So it's a question  Of what 
[02:05:30]  What your purpose is  Really  You're right there  Because if you think  Of and look at  Tom Hanks  Playing Forrest Gump  Right  That's completely  Acceptable  And looked at  As a very dramatic  And wonderful thing  But then  If you take  Somebody that's  Known as an  Offbeat  Prop comic  And they play  That part  It might look  Exploitive  And you're trying  To make fun of it  Instead of trying  To kind of  Yeah  In the film  What is it  The actors  That have  Down syndrome  Are not necessarily  Playing characters  That have 
[02:06:00]  Down syndrome  And that  In of itself  Strangely  Has a taboo  Quality  Absolutely  If you see  Sometimes people  Think that  I'm saying  That it's taboo  To have actors  With down syndrome  In a film  It isn't  You'll see that  In television shows  But what you won't  See are actors  With down syndrome  Playing characters  That do not  Necessarily have  Down syndrome  They always play  Someone with down syndrome  And on top of that  If somebody  With either  A developmental  Disability  Or a disability  Is playing 
[02:06:30]  Is playing  A character  For the most part  They're playing  A benevolent character  Yeah  And I mean  That's fair enough  There's plenty  Of people  With disabilities  That are  Benefactors  To the society  But the second  Film that I made  It is fine  Everything is fine  Is written by  One of the people  That was in  What is it  He doesn't have  Down syndrome  But he was born  With a severe case  Of cerebral palsy  His name is  Stephen C. Stewart  And when he was  In his early twenties  His mother died  He was very difficult  To understand  And the people 
[02:07:00]  He ended up  Being put into  A nursing home  Where he did not  Want to be  And the people  That were taking  Care of him  They would derisively  Call him an MR  A mental retard  Which isn't a nice  Thing to say to anybody  But Steve was  Of normal intelligence  And the emotional  Turmoil  He must have gone  Through for the decade  He was in that  Nursing home  I can't even  Begin to imagine  When he got out  He wrote this screenplay  In the style of  The 1970s TV  Murder mystery  Of the week  Wherein he's  The bad guy  And this was  Something very important  To Steve  Along what we were  Just talking about  He wanted to play  A bad guy 
[02:07:30]  Because he thought  Of himself  As a person  Of course  With a disability  But stressing  On a person  People can have  Dark thoughts  Whether they have  A disability or not  So he wanted  To play a bad guy  He considered himself  An early  He would have  Called himself  A handicapped rights  Activist  Back in the 70s  But this film  There's something  About that  He wrote it  In this genre style  As opposed to  A standard autobiography  It brings out  Certain truths  In his lives  That really 
[02:08:00]  When the whole  Trilogy is done  This film will be  The best film  Of the trilogy  But not only that  I feel like  It'll be the best film  I'll have anything  To do with  In my whole career  I'm very passionate  About the film  Aren't you  Don't you feel  You're giving people  Much too much credit  Because this could  Be interpreted  As your intentions  Being you know  Kind of not  Like you're doing  This to get  A rise out of people  Instead of what  You're doing  Now your intent  Obviously when you  Explain it  It makes perfect sense  But people never 
[02:08:30]  Want to get that  Deep into things  Well I only  This is why  I've been touring  For so long  I have not put  These films out  Digitally specifically  Because I'm aware  Of exactly what  You're saying  Particularly with  What is it  Because Steve  Wrote everything is  Fine  There are certain  Things that become  Very self apparent  But I am with  Every screening of the film  And I have a Q&A  So I  And I don't  It's not that I want  To explain everything  About the film  But I do want to  Put it into context  So I'm very  I'm very careful  About that  Was it hard 
[02:09:00]  Working with actors  With Down syndrome  I mean was that  Difficult  No no  They were great  I mean you know  Of course it was  Written specifically  For people with  Down syndrome  And I wanted to  Incorporate anything  Organic that  Happened  The films  Took me a long  Time to make  But it had  Nothing to do  With that  It just had  To do with  That I financed  Them myself  And that can  I had a very  Bad technical  Problem on  The first film  But no  I actually  Shot the first  Film  It was over  A period of  Two and a half  Years and  Twelve days  So it's a  Very short  Amount of 
[02:09:30]  Days to shoot  A feature film  They were great  The most important  Thing whether  Somebody has  Down syndrome  Or not  Is if somebody  Has enthusiasm  For the project  And everybody  I worked with  Had great enthusiasm  So I had a  Great time  Working with them  And part three  Will go back  To working  With people  With Down syndrome  Did you change  Over the years  From working  In Hollywood  Or at the  Beginning of  Your career  You were accepting  More roles  That I guess  Would be considered  More you know  Publicly accepted  Roles  Well I mean 
[02:10:00]  What do you mean  I'm just saying  Like did  Did you go into  The entertainment  Business  As many people  Do  Hey I love  Doing this  But I also  Want to  I want some  Kind of fame  And wealth  And notoriety  It's a good  Question  My father's an  Actor  His name's  Bruce Glover  In fact  The next film  That I make  I own property  In the Czech  Republic  An old chateau  That was built  In the 1600s  And next to it  Is the horse  Stables  And I'm building  Sets right now  The last year  And a half  I've been having 
[02:10:30]  Sets built  On about 14,000  Square feet  I'm making  Something for myself  And my father  To act in together  We've never acted  Together before  But I grew up  On some level  Around the industry  I became an  Actor professional  At age 13  It was something  I decided to do  On my own  And I thought of it  As basically  A prudent business  Decision  It wasn't something  Where I thought  Oh my father  Wasn't super famous  Or anything  But I saw that  It was a good 
[02:11:00]  Living basically  And I understood  How it worked  And I realized  It was something  That I could do  So on some level  I've always had  A relatively realistic  Point of view  About how  The business works  When I was 16  I learned to drive  I studied professionally  From age 15  Till 20  When I was 16  I learned how to drive  And I went to go  To all of the  Art house movie theaters  That were popular  In Los Angeles  At the time  And this was 1980  And most of the films  That I was seeing  Were films from  The 1970s, 60s 
[02:11:30]  But you know  Films from the  20s, 30s  But what I was noticing  Were these great films  That were asking questions  And I was really excited  About that  And I thought  What a great form of art  To be entering into  What would be an example  Of one of those movies  Because I'm trying to think of  Oh I don't know  Five Easy Pieces  With Jack Nicholson  Easy Rider  2001 A Space Odyssey  Clockwork Orange  You know movies  That are making you  Think about things  Yeah when the credits  Start rolling at the end  You're like  Okay I can't just  Leave this alone  Yeah exactly 
[02:12:00]  And you revisit  In your mind  You can go back  And watch it years later  And you get different thoughts  I love that  And that's what I aspire  To do in my own filmmaking  And that's what I  As a young actor  I was excited  To be a part of  But in the early 80s  I talk about this  A lot of the shows  I can tell  There was  It starts to get political  And I hate to get  Overly political  About things  But I can see  That there were things  That started to change  And what kind of films  Were being funded  And distributed  I was thinking  Where are all these questions  That I wanted to be a part of  And you know 
[02:12:30]  I can go into  A lot of detail  About it  But it's really taken me  To make my own films  To feel satisfied about it  I think sometimes  There are films  That still ask questions  But for the most part  Right now  We're in a pretty  Highly propagandized  Do you think  That they ask  It seems like  What films do now  Is they ask a question  And then they give you  They ask  It seems like a tough question  But then they give you  A very palate pleasing answer  By the end of it  Like they don't ask  Anything tough 
[02:13:00]  But they might go  Into the guise  Of asking a tough question  But they answer it for you  In a perfectly acceptable way  Well I mean  I would say  Virtually everything  Is propaganda  And what I mean by that  Is if  If there's a real question  That's going to cause  People to genuinely  Ask things  That could possibly  Hurt corporate interests  Those questions  Will not be  That film  Will not be funded  Or distributed  I mean  I've started to say this 
[02:13:30]  In kind of  A vague outline  Of what I would say  The main force  Of U.S. corporate propaganda  Is to essentially make  People in the United States  Feel relatively comfortable  With the concept  Of wars abroad  And killing  You know  Various nations  As though the United States  Was a  A moral police force  Around the world  And  And  And  That's the main  The main thrust 
[02:14:00]  Of everything  But you have to look  At metaphor  So it's  It's not like  Those films  Say it directly  It might be done  As a  Lone vigilante movie  Or a superhero movie  Where the concept  Is that this is  A really good force  And there's these  Outside elements  That are bad forces  And if you look  At other countries  There are not  So many  Countries that do  Things like  Superhero movies  And that kind of thing  It's  It's  It's a weird  It's a weird  Topic for me  To get into  Because I do work  In the industry  Right  And I mean  I  You know  I've certainly 
[02:14:30]  Been part of  What I  I would  I would call  This  Propaganda  But I  Feel like  It's healthy  To talk about  And I  I think  I think  To be afraid  Of talking about  It isn't a good thing  I  I don't want  People in the industry  To think  I'm this like  Ne'er do well  Who doesn't want  To have anything  To do with anything  If I was offered  A superhero movie  I'd do it  You know  It's not  But I think  It's  And my experience  Is that the people  Working in the film industry  Are good people  That want to do  Interesting things  And want interesting questions  But there's a 
[02:15:00]  Systematization  That's happened  There's something  That's put in place  And people feel  Concerned about  If they  Try to get something  That really asks questions  Or does something  Either they won't  Get the film made  Or they won't  Or they'll lose  Their job  Or whatever  And I do think  That there's  Corporate interests  That are  Very much  Controlling things  And it's something  That these  Kind of like  I hate to become  Overly political  But things like  The Occupy movement  Which of course  Is a complex movement  But there are questions  Or political elements 
[02:15:30]  That should be  Dealt with  To probably reform  How money  In politics  Is being  How money  Is affecting  Politics right now  Which ultimately  Is that corporations  Have a lot of control  Including our  Media  Over everything  Yeah  But there  There is room  Though  A lot of room  For films  That do  Ask questions  And aren't  Just corporate  Propaganda  I don't think 
[02:16:00]  They're as  The big money makers  You know  They're not  The major  This is something  I disagree with  People often say  Well the kinds  Of movies  The reason  That they're  They're funded  Is because  This is what  People want to see  That I  I don't agree  With that  I think that  The reason  That the films  Are funded  And they're  Highly distributed  Is because  They are  Corporate interests  So therefore  People go see them  If the same  Kind of money  Was put into  A movie  And distributed  Then people  Would go see them  And I say 
[02:16:30]  The last 30 years  For example  Something like  2001 A Space Odyssey  Or The Godfather  You know  I mean  Or Clockwork Orange  Or Full Metal Jacket  These are films  That did well  They asked a lot  Of questions  But there was  A shift  In what kind  Of what was  Funded  Starting somewhere  Around the 1980s  And I mean  2001 A Space Odyssey  That's a pretty  Obscure  Very odd  Type of film 
[02:17:00]  It's incredible  Filmmaking  It's my favorite  Kind of filmmaking  But that was  Not just some  Small independent  Film  That was  An MGM  Giant  Studio film  There's a shift  In what's being  Funded  And it's  It should  It would be nice  If things would  Shift back toward that  I don't see that  Happening right now  Yeah  Not right now  I think it's all cyclical  At some point  Though  It will come back  Around  Things do  Kind of  Change like that  What do you  Do you think about  Your image in Hollywood  And stuff  Because people would  Call you at the very least 
[02:17:30]  Eclectic  Many times  And the projects  You've been involved  In  Does that  Bother you  Or do you think about  Like  Eccentric  Is something  I hear a lot  Eccentric  Meaning  Not following  A mathematical term  Meaning  Not following  The straight line  Which is fine  You know  Artistically  I like to go  Into areas  That are unusual  And thoughtful  I'm okay  With that  And I  I get more  Concerned  Within  In terms of  Just within the business 
[02:18:00]  That people  Think I'm like  This kind of  You know  Person that would be  Difficult to work with  Difficult to work with  That I don't like  But that  That isn't the case  I've been working  For over 30 years  I've worked with  Many people  Over and over again  I  As much as I have  Questions about these things  I'm very grateful  To be part of  The film industry  It's let me be  Fund my films  It's let me have  The time to  Take to  To tour with the films  And meet the people  That are  Interested in what I'm doing 
[02:18:30]  So  I  I do get  Concerned  About that  I know that  On some level  My public persona  Is that of this  Kind of almost  Psychotic  Person  You know  I'm not  But I've never  Really gone out  On like some  Public relations  Tour to try  To fix that  I've always been  Relatively comfortable  With it  Because my  Artistic interests  Go into areas  That are  That I want to go  Is whatever  Whatever it needs  To be  To get to 
[02:19:00]  Some interesting  Thoughtful place  Right  But as far as  Business  I mean  I made these films  I tour with these films  I have to be  Very centric  As a filmmaker  And as a business person  So in reality  I am a centric  Business person  An eccentric  Perhaps artist  I think people  Have the impression  Though that  You go into  A business meeting  And just start  Bouncing off the walls  And what not  Probably  I mean that's  What probably  People think  But how would  I  How would you  Get to this point  Or work this 
[02:19:30]  How would you  Dress yourself  In the morning  That's right  Exactly  You should put  If you do put  This stuff online  Or release it on DVD  Because you like  To explain it  At the end  Would you have  Some kind of  An explanation  In a video  Where you could  Put it online  Where you could  Kind of have  That feeling to it  I don't  I don't foresee  That I'll do it  I  The trouble now  With  With the digital  And I  You know  The music industry  Has been  CD industry  Specifically  Has been decimated  Because of piracy  And I 
[02:20:00]  I'm concerned  For the corporate  Film world  I wish there was  Actually  This is an area  Where I really wish  They were going in  And to the politicians  And saying  Come on  Let's get some  Some laws figured out  About how to  Regulate this  Of course  It would have to be  International  But I  I'm concerned  About what will  Happen in the future  I can recoup  On my films  Which you know  Everything is fine  Was a $200,000  Budget to get  To a 35mm print  It has a great  Production value  For that 
[02:20:30]  I'm very proud of it  But it's a very  Relatively low cost  For a film  When you're  I've been able  To recoup  But when you're  Talking about  Tens or hundreds  Of millions  Of dollars  How  If piracy  Gets to the point  Where people  Can just download  A high quality  Film in seconds  Why  People justify that  And they go  Okay well I'm  Going to do it  How will the  Film industry  Then recoup  I don't understand  They always find  A way  It's really weird  Like with  With Lars and  Napster  They found a way  Like they always 
[02:21:00]  Like it gets  Pirated for a while  But then they  Always find a way  To put in  And put a digital  Stop to it  But it didn't  But it didn't  Because I mean  I mean  The CD sales  Have essentially  Stopped  The way  The way  Musicians make  Their money now  Is by touring  Right  It truly  Switched that  Industry around  And I'm touring  With my film  So that's  Again how  I'm doing  But I wonder  What's going to  Happen  Once you can  Get a 20 gigabyte  Full bodied  Film  Downloaded in 
[02:21:30]  Seconds  Why is  Why would  Anybody go  Pay for the  Same thing  When they can  Just get a  Digital theater  At home  For a thousand  Dollars  And the rest  Of the life  They're sat  To have free  Entertainment  Are CD sales  Suffering  Or is it  Because I know  CDs themselves  Are doing terrible  Because of the  Clunkiness of it  But is the  Music sales  Meaning like  I always thought  Artists would do  Well on iTunes  Because there's  So little overhead  I think it's  Making a little  Bit of a comeback  Yeah because  There's no  Overhead whatsoever  But there are 
[02:22:00]  A few years  Where Crispin  Glover's point  Is accurate  I think  I think  I think  It's  I don't  I mean I'm  Not an expert  But I think  It's okay  It isn't at the  Height that it  Ever was before  But also you  Have to figure  It is different  With music  You can make  An album  Relatively  Inexpensively  I mean of course  You can spend a lot  Of money on an album  But you don't have to  Whereas even the  Least expensive film  You're going to  Spend a lot of money  So it's like  If DVDs start 
[02:22:30]  Becoming  Or you know  The digital download  For a film  Becomes free  And somebody's  Trying to justify  Whether they're  Going to spend  $20 on a DVD  Or just  Download it  On some  Some site  And they don't  Have to pay  For parking  And they can  Project it  Digitally at home  What's the choice  No one's going  To make a movie  For $200 million  Is your point  Why would you do that  Yeah I mean  The risk would be  Too great  I would think  I don't know  I want  I'm part of the industry 
[02:23:00]  I want it to be  Okay  And then of course  My own concerns  About my films  But this is a big part  Of why I don't  I personally have no  Plans to put it out  Digitally  Because it would just  You know  I've been touring  For eight years  It took me six years  To get to the point  Of recruitment  If I'd put it out  On DVD  It would have been  All over the internet  And I wouldn't have  Been able to recoup  With that said  Part of you  Has to think  Man I wish more eyes  Would see my project  Right  Yeah well particularly  Everything is fine 
[02:23:30]  I am very protective  Of what is it  Like I don't want  Clips of it around  On the internet  You know  I'm protective  Of the actors  How many people  Do you think  Have seen your film  Films  Thousands  But not  Hundreds of thousands  Of course I'd rather  Hundreds of thousands  And you're okay with that  Well I'm a business  Practical business person  But there's a weird  Balance there  I understand what you're saying  But there's also the ego  That you want to feed  A little bit  Like I wish more people  Saw this  There is that part of me  But I'm a realist  Ultimately  And even like I was  Describing how I  Entered the business  It's like 
[02:24:00]  On some level  Business first  And I've essentially  Recouped  But it's like  Really specifically  I've only recouped  A quarter by the box office  It's mostly been  By the live show  Which means  At six years  It would be about  24 years of touring  So maybe at the point  That I've genuinely recouped  I'll say  Okay now it's time  To generally release it  Or when you move on  To another project  Officially in your mind  You're like  Okay I'm done with this  Like Jimmy does  You put out your stand-up specials  And like okay  I can finally  Put this out  I'm okay with it 
[02:24:30]  I recoup my money  I'm on to something else  There's a part three  That I'll make  And that's not  The next film  That I'm going to shoot  So it could be  A long time  Before I get to that  But I'm enjoying  This kind of  Live interaction  With the audiences  And it is different  It sits in people's  Different minds  Differently  And people really  Appreciate it  Like I was  I was just in  Paducah, Kentucky  A week or so ago  And you know  The people are very happy  Not everybody goes  To Paducah, Kentucky  And I  I can feel that 
[02:25:00]  Genuinely talking to people  About things that I think  Are important  Or things that I'm  Passionate about  And I  They come back  To the shows  And I can see  That there's  Something that's  Genuinely happened  That sits differently  In their mind  Than if it was just  Something they watched  On their computer  Now are you on the road  Full time with this?  No, no  How many days a year  Do you do this?  Well  I own a house  In Los Angeles  And I own the  Property in the  Czech Republic  I'm  Last year 
[02:25:30]  And this year  I spent more time  In the Czech Republic  Because I've been  Building the sets  Than at my house  In Los Angeles  But ultimately  I'm on the road  More than either  Of those places  Or I'm  Acting in other  People's films  I'm very rarely  In a city  More than two weeks  In a row  But you know  I've been trying  To make it  So it's seasonal  Like I just  I have  This is my spring tour  So I'm touring  For about a month  And as you can hear  I'm a bit hoarse  It's hard  It's not  It's not an easy  Lifestyle  But I've been trying 
[02:26:00]  In the last couple  Of years  To have at least  One tour per season  Where it's a month  Or too long  But it beats me up  It's hard  I'm glad to be doing it  What I've noticed  Is you've got  Incredible patience  How in this world  That we live in  Do you have  Such incredible patience  Where we all  Want something immediately  I've always been  Very patient  Like you're building  Sets for like  You said  The last year and a half  For a film  That you're eventually  Going to shoot  And I bought  The property  Nine years ago  With this in mind  Amazing  But it's also 
[02:26:30]  That I can see  That if I go  And I get money  Corporately  I've given up  On doing that  They wouldn't fund  What I'm interested  In at all  And even if they  Were to pretend  They were going  To fund it  Something would go wrong  And there would be  Intervention  The only way  To really own  What the content  Of your film is  Is to pay for it  And so I'm  That's the  I'm patient about that  Because I'm sincere  In what my passions are  About getting things  Across to me  Things like that  That are like 
[02:27:00]  Obviously very passionate  About your art  What you do  Did you have to  Deal with the fact  That you were in  Such an iconic character  Early in your career  George McFly  Being that like  After that  It would have  Seemed to me  To be very hard  To jump into  Things you're  Interested in now  Well  That  My interests  That I'm interested  In now  Started well  Before I was  In Back to the Future  One of the  Books  Which I wish  I had with me  I had started 
[02:27:30]  Making before  I acted in  Back to the Future  And I finished it  It's called  Rack Hatching  It was the first  One I published  And I put it down  While I was acting  In Back to the Future  And then finished it  And published it  A couple of years later  As the first book  I'd published  I'd made other books  But Back to the Future  You know  It was actually  Very informative to me  In some of the things  That I'm  Talking about  In terms of propaganda  I know it's a very  Beloved film  But I  You know  I was only in the first film  There was  Right  Yeah  A  They had 
[02:28:00]  Taken the molds  Of my face  From the  Old age makeup  From the original film  And put another actor  Into prosthetics  That were made  From my face  And then interspiced  A very small amount  Of footage of me  From the original film  In order to fool audiences  Into believing  That I was in the movie  Because of my lawsuit  There were rules  In the Screen Actors Guild  That make it so producers  Can never do something  Like that again  I'm proud of the lawsuit 
[02:28:30]  But the reason  I bring it up  Is because  The reason that I  Didn't end up  Being in the film  It's more complex  Than this  But I  I was asking  Questions  That the  Producers  Director  Didn't like  Right  I actually  Did work again  With Robert Zemeckis  Strangely enough  When I did Beowulf  And had a very good  Working relationship  With him  But  There was 
[02:29:00]  A different end  In the original draft  That I read  For the screenplay  When I auditioned  For the part  I was only given  What are called sides  The scene  So I got the part  I was 20 years old  I got the role  My agent told me  I'd gotten this part  And I  I didn't really know  Everything about it  And I said  Well maybe  I only knew  That there was  This other part  That I was  The scene  I was doing the scene  With  I said  Well should I go in  For this other part 
[02:29:30]  That seems like  That could be  He said  No no  You don't understand  This is a really  Interesting role  You're going to be  Playing the older  Versions of this character  In a different time period  And I thought  Wow  I said  That's fantastic  I said  Yeah great  Let's close the deal  You know  It's this big  Universal Studios  Produced by Steven Spielberg  And directed by Robert Zemeckis  So great  So  But you know  I was a serious actor  As well  So when I started  Actually analyzing  The screenplay  Once we were  Involved in the project  I had questions  About things  And there was 
[02:30:00]  A different end  I won't go into  So many details  About it  But I had questions  About it  And it did get changed  And I think  There were other people  That had questions  Because there are  Things in it  That could  Particularly in this  Day  Be thought of as  Well  Offensive  And those changes  Happened  It had to do  With money  And what people  Were doing  The characters  Were doing with money  But I didn't  Stop with it  And I said  To Robert Zemeckis  I thought  It was  It was not  A good idea  For our characters 
[02:30:30]  To have a  Monetary  Reward  Because it  Basically makes  The moral of the film  Be that money  Equals happiness  And you know  By having  There were various  Things that were  Doing it  But by having  The son character  Cheer by having  A truck  In the garage  What I was  Arguing for  Was that  The characters  Should be in love  And that the love  Should be the reward  By having  Just by having  Any kind of  Monetary element  As a reward 
[02:31:00]  It makes it  Into a reward  And I still  Feel the same way  I would like  The film a lot  Better  If there was  No monetary  Like there could  Be signs of  Maybe monetary  Change would  Happen  But it was  More important  That the characters  Were in love  I would feel  Much better  About the film  But by having  Those monetary  Rewards in it  It was  It was a  A proposition  And Zemeckis  Got really mad  At me  When I  Said this  And  Didn't you see  He yelled at you  Yeah  He yelled 
[02:31:30]  Yeah  He didn't like it  It's kind of odd  Discussing a film  That old  At this point  But didn't you see  At the end  The characters  They were more  In love  I think  Especially  Your character  And the wife  They did seem to be  But my argument  Is that part was good  I was all for it  But I think  It pollutes it  Do you think  The money  Could have been  A peripheral  Effect of the  Happiness that they  Had  I think it's a  Bad message  Really  I do  I think 
[02:32:00]  Because that's  Propaganda  That says to people  Go out  And borrow money  For banks  This is a big part  Of why the film  Was successful  Because the corporations  Knew that it had  That moral element  In it  Maybe  Maybe  I would also  Argue  I mean  That's only  Because they  Knew that  That was in there  Therefore they  Can feel comfortable  In funding it  And putting a lot  Of money into  Distributing it  Maybe if that  Wasn't in there 
[02:32:30]  Zemeckis and  Bob Gale  Would have not  Been able to  Sell it as readily  I don't know  But what I  Would still argue  Is that  If that  Wasn't in there  And the only  Part that was in there  Was that they  Were in love  And that film  Still did get  Distributed as  Highly as it had  And have as much  Money behind it  I still think  The film would be  Loved  And it would  I think  Personally I think  It would have  A better moral  Why do you  Why do you feel  Since the character  In there wasn't  Crispin Glover 
[02:33:00]  It was George McFly  Do you feel  You have to  Inject part of  Your  I was 20 years old  I was a young  I was a young  I was a young  Idealist  I wouldn't do  That now  I wouldn't do  That now  Well I mean  I write  At that time  I didn't even know  It was like  I just  I'd been in a few  Films  But not that many  Films  And I'd been in  Acting class  Where we did 
[02:33:30]  Improvisations  I came up with  Scenes and thoughts  So I thought it was  Okay to be asking  Questions like that  Now I understand  Very specifically  That you know  There's a lot  Of money  And people have  Gone through  A certain amount  Of troubles  In Zemeckis  I'm sure  It's just asking  Us goddamn questions  We're losing money  Here by the day  Right  Well I mean  To be fair  I wasn't  I wasn't stopping  Production  We were  We were  We were having  A discussion  During the time  But it's still  Yeah no 
[02:34:00]  I wouldn't  I wouldn't do that  Now I fund  My films  With the working  In corporate  Movies  I wouldn't  I know how  Things work  At this point  Why I was bringing  To bring it up  It was because  It was informative  To my  My thought process  As to how  Propaganda does work  Because I had this  Very early experience  And I was  You know  It caused me  To not be in  The sequels  On some level  I'm sure  It's complicated  But  And then there was  A lawsuit 
[02:34:30]  You know  It's not  It was  Very specifically  Not a legal thing  I mean you can just  Say it's not a nice thing  But it's not a legal  Thing to do  Either  So  This informed me  That if you  If you question  Propaganda  It has serious  Consequences  Can I ask you  When you mentioned  When you mentioned  Robert Zemeckis  When you talked to  Zemeckis about  What you thought  Should have happened  How long  Into your explanation  Did you realize  He was not happy  Like did you  Did he listen  Hear you out  Or did he interrupt  You and go look 
[02:35:00]  Well  Well  You know  It's a long time  Ago now  I remember  One conversation  Very specifically  But what I am  Forgetting is  That there were  Two  There might have  Been two parts  To the conversation  Because there was  Some part  That I am not  Going into the  Detail about  That was changed  And it might be  That then I  Continued on  Because they  Changed one thing  And I said  But there is still  This monetary aspect  And so he probably  Was not happy  About it  They had already  Done a change  I think  But I am  Forgetting now  It was  That part was 
[02:35:30]  A while back  But you know  But it's also  There is also  A part when  You're working  On a film  That on some  Level  It doesn't  Happen every day  But you do  Become passionate  About things  That you want  To get done  It's normal  For actors  And directors  Not all  All the time  But it's  Relatively normal  To say  Look this is  Really important  You speak it  Out passionately  They speak it  Out passionately  And then you  Say okay  That's fine  Then you shake  Hands and go  But you can  Have passionate  Conversations 
[02:36:00]  And it doesn't  Mean necessarily  That it's going  To turn into  Some terrible  Thing  Years later  But I mean  And my  Experience in the  Business has been  Good  That would be  The one real  Exception  That wasn't  Good  That was  Not a pleasant  Thing to have  Happen  Because people  Still believe  That that was  Me  And the reason  I had the  Lawsuit  The real reason  The primary  Reason that I  Had it was  I just wanted  People to know  That I wasn't  In there  That wasn't 
[02:36:30]  You  Because if I  Had played that  Part I would  Have played it  Differently  Right  I didn't like  The way that  Guy played it  And people  Think that's  Me  I didn't either  Well I  I mean  You know  I  I mean  I  It's  It's still  It still  Gets to me  That  That  There's that  That confusion  And I  So what  What way is  There to let  It be known  Other than  Do that  So even  Still  That's why  Whenever the  Issue  Anything about  That's brought  Up  Now I do  Talk about 
[02:37:00]  I'm talking  About it  More also  Because there's  One  One fellow  He might have  Even been on  Your show  I'm not sure  Bob Gale  Yeah Bob Gale  Was on  Yeah I think  I listened to it  And on your  Show he lied  He lied about  Yeah and you  Guys automatically  Believed what he  Said  Oh man  Reconcile it  Please  What he said  Was that I  Had  I'm just  Let me  Let me just  Be specific  And let me  Think  He said that  I had asked  For the same  Amount of money  That Michael J.  Fox had  Was getting  In the film  It's 
[02:37:30]  It's total  Fabrication  The reason that  He's doing this  Is because  He wants to  Throw the track  Off of  Of the conversation  Of that  What they had  Done was illegal  So he's trying  To justify  As to why  It was good  For them to  Do this illegal  Thing  And so  Then people  Automatically  Believe  I remember  What he said  Specifically  Was that  Then I had  Called back  After the  Thing was in  Production  Saying oh  I want to  Do it  Or something  Somebody corroborated 
[02:38:00]  And went oops  Or something like  That  I was like  I didn't do  That  I was working  I actually  Did work on  A different  Film at the  Time  A John  Borman  Film  But it's  What happened  In the negotiation  Was I actually  Wanted to be  In the film  But the  The offer  Was less  Than half  Of what  Leah Thompson  And Tom  Wilson  Who had  Similar sized  Roles  And it just  It wasn't fair  It was  My agents 
[02:38:30]  Didn't think  It was fair  And it was  A sequel  I got paid  The same  Amount or  More  Than what  I was being  Offered for  Back to the  Future to do  This other  Film  So it was  Just like  A monetary  And of course  This was a  Gigantically  Well grossing  Film  But it's  Also why  Why did  They do  That  It's because  I had  I read  A great  Book  I recommend  Anybody read  Called how to  Win friends and  Influence people  By dale  Carnegie  I only read  It like in  The 2000s 
[02:39:00]  I wish I'd  Read it when  I was like  A teenager  But but the  One of the  Things that he  Really illustrates  Well is don't  Prove people  Wrong and  That's essentially  What I was  Doing when I  Was having that  Argument with  Zemeckis about  That there was  A moral issue  Here I was  Just thinking  I was being  Like this you  Know it was a  Good moral of  What I was  Arguing for and  I thought they'd  See my point  You know  But but but  But I realized  On some level  That I was and  Especially with  The lawsuit  I proved  People wrong  When you do  Something like 
[02:39:30]  That then they  Come on the  Opie and  Anthony show  And make  Lies up about  You  And make up  Things  Oh my god  Well we just  Assumed  He was talking  Yeah yeah  Which I think  A lot of people  Do  I thought he was  Lying but you  Guys were like  No it sounds  Strictful to me  I'm like alright  Shut it Jim  Never said  I lied for a second  Though  What do you think  Of Steven Spielberg  Well first off  Robert Zemeckis  I think can  Make interesting  Films  I you know  I I I  The second film 
[02:40:00]  That I did  With him  Beowulf  Which was  Written by  Neil Gaiman  And Roger  Ivery  I thought had  Very good  Moral elements  And it was  About lies  Which I have  A lot of  Interest in  And and they  They did  Something very  Interesting with  That film  I think  Zemeckis can  Get into a  Dark  Dark comedic  Territory  That's that's  Very interesting  I liked what  Death becomes  Her and  You know  He's he can  Be be  Interesting  I I tend  Toward feeling  Like Steven 
[02:40:30]  Spielberg  Really does  Work very  Much in  Propaganda  And and and  It's it's  Very well  Hidden  Like I was  Saying a  Little bit  About kind  Of war  If you  Analyze  Steven Spielberg's  Films about  War  They're  Essentially  Pro-war  Films  And I  I I  I don't  Think that's  Good at  This point  In time  To do  You look  At a  Great war  Film like  All  Quiets on  The western  Front or  Paths of 
[02:41:00]  Glory by  Kubrick or  Full Metal  Jacket by  Kubrick  They all  Are  Question  It's  Obviously  Not  Proper  Happy  Ideas  About war  These are  Highly  Questioning  War  Is  Not  There's  No  Question  War  Is  A  Horrible  Thing  And you  Look at  Something like  Saving Private  Ryan which  Is a  Very  Well  Liked  Film  But  Essentially  It's  Arguing  That  There's  Such  A  Thing  As  A  Moral  War  Or  Good  War  And  You  Maybe  You  Can  Make  That  Argument  I  Just 
[02:41:30]  Think  It's  A  Bad  Argument  To  Make  Especially  At  This  Point  In  Time  I  Don't  Think  I  Is  Making  Films  That  Are  Saying  It's  Good  To  Be  Going  To  War  Why  Do  That  What's  Why  Right  I  Mean  I  I  I'm  Sure  There's  All  Kinds  Of  People  And  Veterans  And  Things  That  My  Father  Is  A  Veteran  My  Father  Was  In  The  Korean  War  You  Know  But  It  Was  Like 
[02:42:00]  He  Very  Explained  Very  Clearly  To  Me  Glory  Story  Is  About  Being  In  The  War  And  He  Was  In  Bad  Situations  So  I  Just  I  Maybe  I'm  A  Bleeding  Heart  Pacifist  But  I  Just  I  Just  Think  It's  It's  Not  Good  To  Be  Making  Pro  War  Films  So  I  Question  Spielberg  Is 
[02:42:30]  A  Powerful  Man  That  Doesn't  Money  So  I  Think  Your  Point  Is  He  Could  Take  All  That  Power  And  Do  A  More  Positive  People  Could  Of  War  But  It's  Still  But  Still  When  You  Analyze  It  Somehow  There's  A  Positive  Element  About  Aspects  Of  The  War  And  I  Just  I  Don't  Think  It's  A  Good  Message  To  Put  Out  Which  Is  My  Similar  Argument  With  Back  To  The  Future  There  Are  Interesting  Elements  Back  To  The  Future 
[02:43:00]  The  Structure  Is  Excellent  It's  Part  Of  Why  I  Had  Strong  Arguments  Because  I  Could  See  What  That  Moral  Element  Was  And  I  Knew  It  Would  Have  Effect  Within  The  Culture  Or  I  Felt  It  Would  And  So  When  You  Analyze  Those  Things  It's  Like  You've  Got  A  Lot  Of  Money  You've  Got  A  Lot  Of  Power  Do  Something  That's  Going  To  Genuinely  Affect  The  Culture  At  Large  In  A  Very  Positive  Way  And  I  Just  I  Don't  I  Suppose  I  I'm  Sure  I  Would  Assume 
[02:43:30]  Steven  Spielberg  Feels  Like  He  Was  Doing  Something  Positive  I  Would  Argue  That  It  Would  Be  Much  More  Positive  If  There  Was  A  Clear  Anti-war  Message  You  Ever  Think  Sometimes  That  There  There  Are  You  Know  There's  Filet  Mignon  And  Then  There's  Steak  From  Your  Freezer  Like  Some  Things  Are  Just  Made  To  Be  You  Can  Argue  It  Consumed  I  Can't  Help  But  Be  Analytical  It's  Just  My  Nature 
[02:44:00]  It's  Easy  To  Study  Something  Like  Soviet  Russia  Or  Nazi  Germany  And  Condemn  Those  Things  Rightfully  So  But  Terrible  Things  Went  On  In  Those  Cultures  With  Propaganda  But  It's  More  Difficult  For  Our  Culture  To  Analyze  Our  Propaganda  Especially  In  The  Media  But  I  Think  It's  Important  To  Do  It  Because  I  Think  Our  Culture  Media  Is  Much  More  Well  Oiled  Than  Even  Soviet  Russia  Or  Nazi  Germany  Because  People  Don't  Notice  It  And  So 
[02:44:30]  Things  Like  Saying  Well  It's  Just  This  Is  A  Fun  Movie  Or  All  That  You  Know  There  Is  I  Enjoy  Movies  That  I'm  Sure  Would  Be  Strong  Propaganda  As  Well  Just  Because  Something's  Propaganda  Doesn't  Mean  It's  Not  A  Good  Movie  But  But  I  Think  It's  Really  Important  To  Have  The  Discussion  So  That  People  Are  Aware  Of  This  And  I  Don't  Really  See  The  Discussion  Happening  In  Our  Specifically  About  Film  Which  Is  What  I'm  Most  Passionate  About  It  Happens  In  Other  Are  Is  A  Little  Bit  About  Politics  And  Things 
[02:45:00]  Like  That  But  You  Know  I  Just  Again  As  This  Young  Idealist  When  I  Was  16  I  Wanted  To  Be  A  Part  Of  This  Industry  That  Was  Questioning  Things  I  Would  Like  It  To  Come  Back  Do  You  Think  There  There  People  That  You  Like  Yes  They're  Doing  It  Right  That's  A  Positive  Message  For  Our  Culture  Maybe  I  Hesitate  To  Point  To  Things  But  There  Are  I  Can  Tell  There  Are  Some  Directors  Working 
[02:45:30]  In  The  Corporate  Industry  That  Are  Striving  Really  Hard  And  Every  Once  In  A  While  They  Do  There  Is  A  Film  That  Will  Come  Out  And  And  That  Asks  Questions  For  Real  And  And  Is  Artful  And  The  Ones  I  More  Think  Of  Are  Not  Big  Popular  Films  I  Very  Much  Like  Aspar  Noe  Enter  The  Void  But  That's  Not  A  Big  Huge  Popular  Film  I  Thought  That  Was  A  Really  Well 
[02:46:00]  Made  Film  I  See  Things  That  Happen  In  The  Corporate  Films  That  There  Are  Some  Very  Good  Directors  That  I  Would  Love  To  Work  With  But  I  Get  Nervous  About  Getting  Into  Putting  Examples  Because  Because  I  Can  See  That  Even  When  Somebody  Is  Really  Striving  Hard  Maybe  There  Are  Reasons  Why  It  Didn't  Go  As  Hard  As  It  Could  Have  Gone  Understand  But  I  I  Mean  Again  I  I  I'm  So 
[02:46:30]  Glad  To  Be  A  Part  Of  The  Industry  And  I  Want  To  Work  With  People  I  Don't  Want  To  Be  It's  It's  Difficult  For  Me  To  Talk  Like  This  Because  I  Feel  Like  I  Bob  Gale  Was  On  The  Show  So  It's  Like  It  Does  Happen  And  I  It's  Well  You  Set  The  Record  Straight  Today  I'm  Glad  And  We  Apologize 
[02:47:00]  For  That  We  Didn't  Have  Your  Phone  Number  I  Mean  Why  Wouldn't  People  Think  Something's  True  But  The  Reason  I  Point  To  It  Specifically  Is  He  Was  In  Something  That  You  I've  Seen  Even  When  I  Use  The  Illegal  That  People  Oh  Drama  Queen  But  Very  Specifically  I  Saw  Somebody  Write  Those  Words  I  Have  Them  Tattooed  Over  My  Ass  But  Very  Specifically  You 
[02:47:30]  Know  It  Was  Illegal  And  So  If  Some  And  He  Was  A  Prime  Architect  Of  That  Illegal  Activity  So  There's  A  Motive  To  Make  Something  Seem  You  Know  Like  It  Was  Justified  To  Do  This  And  That's  Why  He's  Saying  These  Things  Should  Look  At  Him  And  Just  Said  Now  Don't  Con  Me  Bob  Yeah  I  Mean  He  Said  A  Lot  Of  Things  It's  Not  Just  That  There  Are  Negative  Things  That  Have  Been  Said  To  Me  About 
[02:48:00]  About  About  Me  On  On  The  Blu-rays  That  Are  Not  True  And  Oh  Commentary  Really  Yeah  Yeah  He  Said  Things  That  Are  Like  I  Mean  I  Haven't  Listened  To  It  All  In  Completion  Myself  But  I've  Had  People  Come  Up  And  Say  Did  This  This  And  This  I  Said  Where  Did  You  Hear  That  And  They  Said  On  The  Commentary  On  The  Blu-ray  For  Back  To  The  Future  And  It's  Always  From  Him  It's  Not  From  Robert  Zemeckis  It's  Not  I  Mean  Steven  Spielberg  Doesn't  Comment  At  All  But  Bob 
[02:48:30]  Gale  Still  Is  That's  His  Main  Career  At  This  Point  As  Well  He  Doesn't  Really  Write  Films  Anymore  Is  Not  In  The  Industry  Other  Than  Having  To  Do  With  Things  Having  To  Future  So  I  Think  The  Fact  That  There  Was  This  Lawsuit  And  He  Has  A  Lot  Of  Focus  Specifically  On  That  Film  Series  He  Has  A  Lot  Going  On  In  His  Mind  About  It  Specifically  That  There  Was 
[02:49:00]  An  Illegal  Action  And  That  Was  It's  In  The  Public  Record  So  He  Has  To  Just  It  Is  Just  An  Odd  Thing  That  Movie  Did  Become  So  Beloved  In  American  Well  And  Part  Of  It  Is  Part  Of  It  Is  That  There  Are  Good  Structural  Elements  There  Are  Interesting  Things  In  It  And  Unfortunately  That  Element  There  Are  Other  Movies  That  In  The  History  Of  U.S.  Filmmaking  That  Do  Similar  Elements  With  Their  Structure 
[02:49:30]  Where  It  Seems  As  Though  It's  About  Love  But  There  Is  A  Monetary  Reward  And  They're  Very  Popular  Films  I  Think  A  Lot  Of  People  See  It  Though  As  Boy  Who  Wouldn't  Want  To  Go  Back  In  Time  And  Change  Things  For  The  Better  When  You  Then  Come  Back  And  You're  Like  Wow  I  Fixed  It  That  Part  Is  Great  Yeah  That  Part  That  That's  A  Big  Part  Of  Why  It's  And  That's  That's  What's  Also  Is  My  My  Argument  About  It's  Like  All  This  Stuff  Is  Great  Why  Do  You  Need  To  Put  This  Monetary  Reward  In 
[02:50:00]  It  Would  Make  It  Such  A  More  Pure  Message  Of  Love  Instead  Of  You  Know  Dirtying  It  Up  With  A  Messy  Element  You'd  Rather  Have  Seen  A  67  Falcon  In  That  Garage  I  Would  Have  Rather  Not  That  That  Didn't  Happen  I  Would  Just  Rather  That  There  Was  You  Know  And  The  Scene  Was  Also  Reshot  You  Know  There  Was  A  Different  Actor  Playing  The  Part  Originally  Eric 
[02:50:30]  Stoltz  Originally  Played  The  Part  And  Then  Michael  J.  Fox  Replaced  Him  We  Had  Already  Shot  The  Sequence  That  I'm  Talking  About  The  Alternate  Future  And  I  Had  Played  It  Slightly  Differently  And  Then  They  Fired  Back  Eric  Stoltz  And  I  Thought  I  Was  Going  To  Get  Fired  As  Well  But  We  Robert  Zemeckis  Made  Very  Clear  That  He  Wanted  Me  To  Play  It  Quite  Relatively  Different  Than  I  Had  Played  It  Originally  And  I  At  The 
[02:51:00]  Point  That  We  Shot  The  Alternate  Future  The  Second  Time  When  We  Shot  That  Scene  I  Was  Basically  I  Would  Call  It  Acting  From  The  Spinal  Cord  I  Was  Afraid  I  Was  I  Was  Oh  Yeah  I  Thought  I  Was  Going  To  Get  Fired  If  I  Didn't  Do  Exactly  What  What  They  Said  I  Didn't  Want  I  Was  Again  I  Was  20  I  Didn't  Want  To  Get  Fired  I  Wasn't  Looking  For  Controversy  I  Wanted  To  Do  A  Good  Job  How  Would  You  Have  Liked  To  Have  Seen  That  Ending  Play  Out  If  You  Had  Say  The  Only  Thing  Was 
[02:51:30]  That  I  Didn't  Think  There  Should  Have  Been  Monetary  The  Kind  Of  Clothes  So  When  They  Walk  In  That  Is  What  I  Was  Getting  Into  So  When  They  Walk  In  They  Been  Playing  Tennis  And  They  Have  Nice  Clothes  On  Like  All  That  Was  I  Thought  It  Just  It  All  Pointed  Toward  This  Idea  That  Happiness  Was  About  Wealth  It  Made  Me  Really  Uncomfortable  What  I  Was  Wearing  Holding  A  Tennis  Racket  I  Did  It  Because  I  Thought  I  Was  Going  To  Get  Fired  But  I  Vocalized  That  I  Didn't  Think  This 
[02:52:00]  Was  A  Good  Idea  And  I  Think  There  Might  Be  Some  Commentary  On  The  Blu-ray  About  Where  They  Said  Crispin  Didn't  Like  His  Clothes  I  Didn't  Care  About  The  Clothes  It  Was  Like  I  Cared  About  The  Message  And  And  So  And  So  That  Was  A  Very  Specific  Message  I  You  Know  I  Didn't  Write  Again  I  Wouldn't  Do  It  Now  I  Wouldn't  Make  This  Element  Of  Propaganda 
[02:52:30]  And  Maybe  I  Say  Something  And  If  They  Don't  Want  To  Do  It  Fine  But  I  I  Was  You  Know  20  Years  Old  Is  Really  Quite  Young  You  Just  Don't  Understand  How  Compelling  This  Is  For  Me  To  Ask  You  Sure  I  Was  Just  Wondering  Like  Because  I  Think  I  Think  The  Happiness  And  And  How  Do  You  Show  Success  He  Went  From  Being  You  Know  The  Goofy  Kind  Of  Loser  Guy  Being  Very  Successful  Because  Of  What  Happened  In  That  Moment  How  Do  You  Show  The  Success 
[02:53:00]  Part  There  Is  A  Million  Ways  You  Can  Do  It  I  Mean  I  Mean  It  But  We're  Not  It  Could  Take  Days  To  Really  Sit  And  Figure  Out  Exactly  What  It  Is  I  It's  Not  Something  That  I'm  Prepared  To  Say  Exactly  What  The  Illustration  Of  It  Would  Be  I'm  Sure  There  Would  Be  A  Cinematic  Illustration  Of  Love  And  Success  That  Would  Work  And  I  Don't  Have  That  Answer  At  This  Moment  And  Was  It  Odd  That  Biff  Would 
[02:53:30]  Be  Around  The  House  At  All  Seeing  What  He  Did  Well  See  That  That's  Part  Of  What  The  Change  Was  From  What  I  Originally  Read  In  The  Screenplay  There  Were  Different  People  It  Wasn't  Biff  That  Was  The  Servant  To  The  Family  And  I  Had  Questions  About  It  And  It  Did  Get  Do  They  Have  Slaves  Or  Something  I  Don't  Want  To  Go  Into  A  Lot  Of  Detail  I  Know  Well  I  Don't  Want  To  Go  Into  A  I  Am  Actually  In  The  I'll 
[02:54:00]  Write  It  Down  In  A  Book  At  Some  Point  I  Would  Love  To  Read  It  But  For  Now  I  Do  Hope  I  Get  To  See  And  Talk  To  People  At  The  Museum  Of  Art  And  Design  And  If  You  Can  Tell  People  Crispin  Glover  Dot  Com  Has  The  List  Of  Where  I'm  Going  To  Be  Crispin  Glover  Dot  Com  I  Want  To  Go  See  This  Absolutely  We  Were  Very  Confused  Trying  To  Figure  This  Whole  Thing  Out  Yeah  But  You  Going  To  Be  Showing  Two  Films  Yeah  Well  On  Subsequent  Nights  Tomorrow  Night  I  I  Be
