<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious tirade against SiriusXM management, fueled by perceived unfair treatment compared to Howard Stern.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, detailed several grievances including a proposed unwanted shift to an afternoon timeslot, cancelled studio upgrades, lack of promotional support, and an alleged attempt to extort money for an event they organized themselves.  They recounted a missed meeting with Oliver Stone and a subsequent angry phone call from SiriusXM executive Tim Sabian about their early departure.  They also discussed negative feedback from a controversial segment featuring Newt Gingrich.  Sam Roberts was present in the studio, participating in the angry discussion, which included frequent profanity and speculation about leaving SiriusXM to launch a podcast.

The show then shifted to a discussion of recent mayoral elections.  The hosts lambasted Bill de Blasio's progressive policies, contrasting him unfavorably with Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg.  Their critique of Chris Christie's victory speech focused on its perceived sentimentality and the overuse of the phrase "no one left behind," which they deemed unrealistic and antithetical to capitalism.  They also commented on Detroit electing its first white mayor in 40 years.  This segment was interspersed with crude jokes, unrelated anecdotes (including a sleepless plane trip), and mentions of upcoming podcast appearances.  The hosts also reviewed *Heat* (praising Bill Burr's performance) and negatively reviewed *The Heat*.  Scheduled guests were mentioned: Dr. J (Julius Erving) and Jason Statham.

The show continued with technical difficulties affecting the phone lines.  A listener's negative review of *The Heat* sparked a vulgar discussion about *Little People Big World*, featuring a particularly graphic description of the cast's hands.  The main focus then shifted to the Rob Ford crack cocaine scandal in Toronto.  Opie and Anthony played audio clips of Ford attempting to address the allegations, analyzing his statements and speculating about a possible anonymous call he may have made to a Toronto radio station to defend himself.  Two listener anecdotes about Ford, involving a weight-loss failure and a prank call, were shared.

The latter part of the show featured an in-studio interview with Julius "Dr. J" Erving.  Dr. J discussed his career, family tragedies (including the unplanned pregnancy of a sportswriter wearing braces), financial ups and downs, and his views on adult lispers and his relationship with Richard Pryor.  This was followed by an interview with Jason Statham, covering his film *Homefront*, his acting style, the reported conflict between Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis on *The Expendables*, and his love of fast cars.  Both interviews contained profanity and casual humor.  Jim Norton then hosted a brief advice segment, answering listener calls about issues such as low libido after sobriety, grief, and relationship insecurities, using similar informal and profane language.

A later segment featured Jim Norton fielding calls about addiction and sleep problems.  Callers discussed diabetes management improving sleep, experiences with ASV machines and Ambien (including unconventional disposal methods), struggles with sobriety while on medication, and addiction to painkillers, alcohol, and food.  A Marine Corps veteran with PTSD discussed sleep medication challenges during alcohol recovery.  Many callers detailed experiences with 12-step programs, and the segment included discussions about a girlfriend's request for Islamic conversion and the substitution of alcohol addiction with marijuana use.  Norton offered advice and shared personal experiences throughout, interspersed with a Steven Singer Jewelers commercial.  The show concluded with Dr. J's book signing announcements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice show.  How can I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you're not going to find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, this is good radio right here. 
[00:00:30]  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  Yay.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted, I'm telling you.  We're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, he would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  Palaver.  Strap in, folks.  Enough fucking palaver.  Good morning.  God damn it.  This fucking...  I...  I...  This fucking ulcer hole we live in.  We're working.  Oh, boy.  Crap.  It probably should have went on 15 minutes ago.  Yike.  Yike.  I'm fucking livid.  Yike.  I'm livid.  Well, we can bring everyone up to speed. 
[00:02:00]  Fucking place.  Um...  Yesterday after the show, I really couldn't stay yesterday.  And neither could I.  That's how it works.  And that's the truth.  That really is the truth.  There are some days I skate out here because I just don't feel like, you know, doing any  more radio.  So I skate at 10 o'clock.  And sometimes we stay late.  It's just the nature of our show these days.  Let me tell you something.  More times than not.  Oh, way more times.  We stay here past 10. 
[00:02:30]  Way more.  We don't leave fucking...  You know, we stay here past 10.  So, uh, after the show yesterday at 10 o'clock, we both left.  Oliver Stone was, uh, very late.  Very late.  He was supposed to be here at 930.  And I would have loved...  And Anthony makes some good points.  It's like, you know, guests aren't late for other shows.  Yeah.  Ever.  But for some reason, they could be late for, you know, our show. 
[00:03:00]  Let's get to the morning show.  Once we're relaunched.  Oh, right, right.  There's another fucking...  So, well, let's deal with one situation at a time.  One shit at a time.  What?  When did you become the voice of reason?  I've been the voice of reason for a long time, but people still haven't forgotten all  the years of me being a complete over-the-top asshole, Sam Roberts.  The psycho?  Yeah, the psycho.  Hello!  Hello!  No, man.  So, uh, this stuff used to drive me insane. 
[00:03:30]  And it's so fun to watch you two losing your mind.  I am so...  Because I just know it now.  When you know it, you know, it sets you free.  So, uh, we left at 10.  Yeah.  We kind of made a bit out of it.  Sure.  I think which hurt us in the end.  We kind of made a bit like, oh, my God, we got to get out of here before, you know,  he gets here because we don't want to see him in the hall.  Well, so we try to, you know, I've been using this word a lot lately, but we try to pump  things up a little bit for you, make it a little more exciting. 
[00:04:00]  So we made it a thing that, holy shit, we got to get out of the building before we run  into Oliver Stone in the hallway because we know we can't, you know, stay.  So then I get into Kenny's car and my phone was, like, lit up.  Like, you know, we were talking about this the other day, you know, to get a phone call  on your phone is weird.  Oh, boy, but I had some missed calls.  And then a text message from Tim Sabian with his phone number saying, call me, what do  you say, whatever, it was urgent, call me, you know, immediately or something like that. 
[00:04:30]  So I call him and he goes, he goes to me, I'm at a loss for words.  Oh, there's a change.  That's something new.  When you talk to him, you can't get a word in edgewise.  But, you know, now he's at a loss for words.  Yeah.  And he can't comprehend why we didn't, you know, hang around for Oliver Stone.  And then I apologize to him for not bringing him up to speed on the fact that we stay late 
[00:05:00]  a lot.  More times than not.  And, you know.  Absolutely.  And it gets to a point where the company just expects us to just stay late all the  time, which is fine, by the way, until you need a favor from them.  Yeah.  Well, I think I brought this up in the past, but one year they actually attempted to charge  me because they thought I took too many days for the contract year.  Jeez. 
[00:05:30]  And I'm like, are you kidding me?  You know how much extra hours we've done during the year?  I'm not asking for money for that, but I'm certainly not going to fucking pay you guys  money because you think I took too many vacation days.  Right.  You know, it's a wash.  And in the end, it shouldn't even be a wash because I know, because I started keeping  track, like I said to you before the show, on average, we do about 50 minutes of extra  radio a week.  Right.  A little more than that, actually, when I was keeping track.  You know.  Yeah. 
[00:06:00]  Those days when we're here to 10-15, 10-30.  10-17.  10-17 sometimes.  Sometimes 10-08, 10-41 one day.  10-18.  10-18.  Never.  10-18.  Never.  Well, we'll try for that today.  10-19 or 10-17.  10-18 can fuck itself in the ass.  So I explained to Tim, I'm like, look, you know, we do a lot of extra radio to the point  where the company just expects it.  So then when we leave like we did yesterday, because we picked and choosed, I truly couldn't 
[00:06:30]  stay yesterday.  That was one of those things where we're like, look, we're not staying late today.  Sorry.  Sorry the guy's late.  A lot of times we schedule guests for 10 o'clock because that's the only time they could  do it.  And we sit here and do the interview and it's cool and we're all in and stuff.  We're not bitching or complaining or mad.  But yesterday was one of those situations where Oliver Stone was late and sorry, I had to  go.  You had to go.  I had to go.  So we pushed it over to Sam Roberts, who's more than capable, as much as we beat the shit  out of him, of doing an interview. 
[00:07:00]  Plus it's still on our channel.  Right.  Plus we weren't going to get anything different from Oliver Stone than what Sam got, because  the guy, quite frankly, is a communist sympathizer.  Kind of a, kind of a bore.  A little bit.  He's kind of a bore.  He's like, nice guy.  I was into the history thing, the whole history thing.  It was nice and stuff, but many people probably aren't.  He, uh, you know, he's made some amazing movies, but he's not the most, uh, thrilling guest  we're going to have on the show. 
[00:07:30]  So Sabian's just like at a loss for words that we would leave and that we wouldn't do  more.  I'm not hard to believe.  And I say this, more free radio for the company.  Right.  I mean, I know for a fact we're way underpaid.  These are our issues.  I know because people are going to be like, but the fact is we are.  And on top of that, we do a lot of extra radio.  So I'm not going to sit here and get yelled at because we leave when we're scheduled  to leave.  Especially with the multitude of behind the scenes shit that goes on here where they undermine 
[00:08:00]  this show and us.  Uh, it's amazing.  Everything we come up with at every turn undermined, whether it's event, whether it's fucking something  we want to do on the show, a guest, a fucking, uh, uh, uh, uh, kind of thing where we believe  it or not, if that Bobo get in his bath, if we would have told anyone about that, we wouldn't  have been able to do it.  Of course.  Well, and you know, not in the morning we couldn't.  Yeah.  Maybe.  And we actually had, maybe once we moved to afternoons, blow me. 
[00:08:30]  Well, we are not moving to afternoons.  No, we're moving to afternoons.  No, no.  Yeah.  Supposedly we are moving to afternoons.  It's a stupid.  When we relaunch the channel, we're moving to afternoons.  Yeah.  Give up nine hours a day of listeners.  Why not?  That's a great idea.  Why not?  Nine hours a day, gone.  What's the ulterior motive, Tim?  What's the fucking ulterior motive, Tim, for us to go to afternoons that you're talking  to everybody like it's already going to happen?  I'm not moving to afternoons.  My contract says six to ten. 
[00:09:00]  Deal with that.  Call my fucking agent.  I'm not fucking moving to afternoons.  Nope, we're moving.  It's a stupid idea.  Fuck off.  Pat it.  Could I try to do it with a couple of times?  No, no, no.  Please.  Not right now.  Yeah.  Please.  No.  See, I have a meeting with him tomorrow.  Holy fuck is he in for a surprise.  I think you might be having a meeting today.  He's not getting a word in edgewise.  I think you're having a meeting today.  You think I am?  Yes.  I gotta go.  I got shit to do again. 
[00:09:30]  I'm scheduled to meet tomorrow.  Plenty of time.  Prepare.  I believe you're meeting today.  Prepare for your meeting.  I believe you're meeting today.  I ain't fucking meeting today.  Did he call you?  Because I said...  I got shit to do.  Please call in, because he'll explain this as well.  I don't even think he has my number.  He said he would.  He said he was going to call you about it.  Well.  You're right about the undermining of the show.  He has no respect for me, by the way.  No?  He's still from that fucking school of thought of years ago with Opie, the radio professional.  Nice.  Me, the goofy fucking douchebag that comes in.  So he'll talk to you, but he talks to me kind of, ah, it doesn't really matter, because 
[00:10:00]  he's just the fucking tag-along fucking co-host, fucking flunky sidekick.  I understand he's got no fucking respect for me or my fucking opinions.  And boy, is he in for a fuck surprise tomorrow at this fucking meeting.  He thinks he's getting a word in edgewise.  I'm doing the talking, fella.  Can we talk about the undermining?  Because I think you're making a very good point.  Because at every turn, we're being undermined. 
[00:10:30]  And we had a meeting with a bunch of guys that were going to at least redesign this tiny  little studio that we're in.  And that went by the wayside.  When was that meeting again?  We wrote that down.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  It was before the summer.  Yeah.  Where they came in with clipboards.  And they were going to just shave down the console.  They were going to maybe move this thing out of here.  And just make it look like a more professional broadcast area.  And for whatever reason, they blew that off.  And then they turn around and they put out another press release where they do even more 
[00:11:00]  for Howard.  Which, you know, is fine.  And you can call it jealousy.  You can call it whatever you want.  But the fact is, everyone else here suffers because they have him.  Period.  They're going to spend a shitload of money putting together a birthday celebration for  him.  Yeah, look at Jimmy's face.  Exactly.  While they try to fucking squeeze us for every dime.  Exactly.  And it's three weeks after his actual birthday. 
[00:11:30]  So it's a big fake fucking event.  And they're going to be spending a shitload more money on him while everyone else suffers  while we have to sit here in just a shitty studio.  And listen to them shake us down.  Well.  Fuck that.  Well, we'll get into the extortion another day.  Yeah, I know.  I'm just saying, shake us down.  Because there is an extortion thing happening.  There's plenty of shit going on behind the scenes that makes me fucking...  That's repulsive.  Wow.  And then you've got to sit down.  Not only do we squeeze fucking amazing shows out of this shithole, but then we've got 
[00:12:00]  to listen and take shit for it.  They should be kissing our fucking asses for what we're doing.  What's going on in here?  Well, good news, though.  Tim said, well, now that I understand, you know, the situation, I'll deal with this on  my end.  Because I guess he's hinting that it's a huge problem.  It's not.  We left at 10 o'clock when we're supposed to leave yesterday.  That fucking...  Why would we want to stay here past 10 ever?  But we still do it.  We do it.  Because we like what we do.  More days than we don't, we do it.  We were here the other day until fucking 1045. 
[00:12:30]  Talking to fucking people.  I was listening in the car when Bobby Slayton was on.  That was really great with Bobo.  And I enjoyed it as a listener going to the airport.  It was fun.  And we stayed very late on that day.  And it's like, then we catch shit.  But see, I don't even...  Yeah, I don't even realize when we're staying late.  I don't either.  Because we stay late when we're having a good time.  If we're having a good time, we'll continue.  For our own benefit.  Not for the company.  I wasn't going to stay here yesterday to interview Oliver Stone at 10 o'clock. 
[00:13:00]  Because at that point, it would have been for the company.  But they don't really do anything for us.  And Scott Greenstein has been begging us for a big, huge, over-the-top event.  A big O'Brien Anthony event.  He feels like we really need that.  And we finally gave him the event.  Yeah.  And of course, there's issues.  Major issues.  We'll get into another day.  But that's just another fucking thing.  But that's what he asked from us.  And we go, okay, here it is.  We handed it to him.  We handed it to the company.  Like, you don't even have to do anything.  Here. 
[00:13:30]  And what a fun fucking show we had yesterday.  Very fun.  The listeners loved it and shit.  What are you trying to say?  And then you're thinking.  Wow.  The writing's on the wall.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't think I don't know that he's fucking going to try to ask me.  I know he is.  Oh, probably.  I wouldn't put it past him at this point.  I don't know what his motives are anymore.  I'm losing trust.  I'm losing trust in that guy at a fucking alarming rate.  At a fucking alarming rate.  Why?  Because he's going behind my fucking back.  He hasn't done anything yet.  In my opinions, I hear from the staff. 
[00:14:00]  They go to meetings and fucking...  Paranoid in the air.  They go to meetings and come back and let me know that he's fucking speaking as if this  afternoon thing is pretty much a done deal.  Just got to fucking cross the T's and top the I's.  That'd be great.  We could sleep in, though.  Oh, sleep in.  And sit in traffic and die in my car on the expressway.  In fucking rush hour traffic going back to Long Island.  Miss out fucking on an entire day of radio. 
[00:14:30]  Nine hours of fucking listeners.  Nine hours of listeners.  L.A.  Morning Drive, which we're going to have.  L.A.  Morning Drive would be gone.  I mean, what...  He never came up with a good idea or a good reason that we would do that.  Well, I told him he needs to, you know, come up with a good reason why that makes sense.  I haven't heard it.  Because I've already said yes.  Oh, shit.  Oh, my God.  Afternoons would suck. 
[00:15:00]  Millionaire radio host who works five hours a day.  We're underpaid.  Well, yeah.  Yeah, we are.  Shut up.  We are.  I mean, you know, we're lucky to be doing what we do for a living.  But the fact is, yeah, we are.  Do you go to your boss and tell him, yeah, I'm totally happy with what I make.  Thank you, sir.  Give me more work.  And then fuck with me on a daily basis.  And a lot of the people...  Tell me to stay late for nothing.  Shut up.  Yeah, would you stay late for nothing no matter what?  Stay late.  For nothing.  For nothing.  Whether you're part-time, minimum wage, or making a solid salary. 
[00:15:30]  Would you stay late for nothing?  And stay late.  By the way, you have been staying late and doing work.  But then when you didn't stay late on that one day, the boss yells at you.  Right.  It's shut up.  It's having...  It's all relative.  It's having principles.  Yeah.  No matter how much money you make.  So shut up.  And then I love these guys that kind of love to just downplay it and go, you know, you  only work four or five hours a day.  Four or five hours a day.  No.  We work the entire day.  This is one of these jobs where you're constantly working and preparing for the radio show. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  I mean, you only hear us for the four hours.  You know, like when you're working, you get that big cock up your ass.  There's that prep time to lube.  That's not work.  That's fun.  And gape.  And then there's the cum clean up afterwards.  Oh, swallow it while I clean it up.  Sorry.  It's trying to be helpful.  It's trying to save it one time.  And I don't want...  Unlike the other guy, I don't want anyone, you know, fucking sad because of our issues 
[00:16:30]  and problems.  We have great lives.  Trust me.  Not even the point here.  But, you know, I do have my principles.  And when you know when the big guy is making pretty much all the money around here, and  we get to squeeze out a little bit of it, I feel bad for the other people around here  because they don't even get to squeeze anything.  Maybe a drop.  You know.  I am fucking just livid.  Livid.  I mean, we did a great show yesterday.  It was a lot of fun.  Why?  And then Oliver Stone... 
[00:17:00]  This was like old school.  Remember all the times at N.E.W. we did amazing shows and then what was waiting for us?  We just get shit on.  A good yelling.  A good bitching at.  A good bitching at as we're trying to, like, leave.  When all was said and done yesterday, Oliver Stone was not going to make or break our fucking  radio show.  And it never will any day.  Well, there's rumors because I haven't heard from the man myself, but there's rumors that  there was an issue with the Newt Gingrich interview, too.  Did you hear anything about that?  What did you hear about that? 
[00:17:30]  About what?  The Newt Gingrich boner.  You're allowed to speak because we're asking you.  He called in.  As long as you guys don't offer up info on your own, I think you're okay.  No, you're...  You have immunity.  But if we're asking, then you have to tell us.  Newt Gingrich called in.  Is there a problem with the Newt Gingrich interview?  Because...  Jimmy did chip.  And it was hilarious.  Let me tell you about the Newt Gingrich interview.  It would have been a bore fest because he's one of those guys that has nothing to do with  the questions and took the lead on that one, and he was doing a great job. 
[00:18:00]  But a Newt Gingrich, he has his talking points, and that's all you're going to hear over and  over again.  So when Jimmy decided out of nowhere, because we didn't even discuss this one, that he was  going to do the whole chip thing, it was awesome.  And then I threw in a...  Yeah!  But...  That's great.  It was kind of like a Louis C.K.  But that's not why I did it at all, to be...  There was nothing to go viral.  You don't even have to explain.  No, no, but here's why I did it.  I'm not even saying that, you know, you did it to go viral.  It made sense that you did that.  I just...  I personally disliked Newt Gingrich, but I didn't want to sabotage the interview and 
[00:18:30]  be a dick to him, but like...  He got his points out.  Right.  He got to say what he wanted.  He got to plug his book.  He got to plug his book signing.  Yeah.  It wasn't about like, hey, let me make a motherfucker.  It was just be an ass, amuse the listeners that like Chip, and Ant would have done a brilliant  job with the interview, but it was one of those 10-minute talking point phoners, and  it's like, I personally can't stand Newt Gingrich.  But it's okay, because we do a million straight interviews.  Every once in a while, you do a little... 
[00:19:00]  You do the goof.  You do the goof.  It wasn't like, hey, fuck you, Newt, or anything like that.  And I followed the feedback from show to show, and people loved it.  And you know what?  People absolutely loved that you did that.  We are past the point where some fucking supervisor is going to pick the show apart and take  pieces of it and critique what we did.  What, are we going to air check with you next?  Like we're spinning records?  Reading liners?  Fuck you.  I'm not going to sit here and have our show picked apart piece by piece. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, that segment.  Oh.  I think we know what we're doing at this point.  So, what was said about the Newt Gingrich interview?  I mean, not everybody got it.  I don't think.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Should have done a phony phone call to him.  Yeah, maybe that's it.  What do you mean?  He didn't...  What?  Just tell us.  Not everybody got it, you know?  You know?  You know what I mean?  You're allowed to speak openly.  We're asking you.  I know I'm allowed to, but not everybody got it. 
[00:20:00]  But what was said?  Yeah, I'd like to know the context.  Yeah.  How it was put.  What information was given to you that led you to believe that some people didn't get it?  It was very briefly mentioned in a conversation about the Oliver Stone.  What was like, what kind of words were used?  What was said about the Oliver Stone?  A lot of the information that was relayed to you was relayed to me as well.  Like he didn't understand?  Yeah.  So, all right.  How about we make a deal? 
[00:20:30]  Every time we stay past 10, there's one of those douchebags in a suit from upstairs waiting for us,  and they hand us a little check.  Yeah.  Or let's just put a time clock.  Let's get a fucking time clock.  Well, we need a hot clock.  With a punch card.  Right.  We'll have our punch cards, and we'll actually clock out every day when we leave,  and then we'll be able to see at the end of the week how much radio we're doing.  Well, now we've got to keep track.  Again.  I was keeping track for a while, because they hit me hard. 
[00:21:00]  They wanted me to pay for like, I think it was three days.  What was said about Newt Gingrich, the interview?  What was said about Alfred Stone?  I want to know exactly what was said.  They probably want to give me my own show or something, right?  I don't think that was said at all.  The Chip interviews.  Fuck yeah.  Talk to him, Chip.  Go ahead.  Get the dirt.  He didn't understand why we didn't stick around?  But does he know that we've stuck around for many, many guests?  He probably doesn't.  And Tim was honest when he said that he's kind of just now getting used to this whole thing. 
[00:21:30]  He was aware of the show, but when he was working with Howard and before, he hasn't been listening to the show.  He should be used to a guy not being there.  Yeah, right?  What are you talking about?  It's used to someone not being there.  What are you talking about?  That's a good counterpoint.  But yeah, and so he's not used to seeing a booked guest arrive without hosts there or, you know, somebody on the level of Newt Gingrich. 
[00:22:00]  No, it's not a booked guest.  It's a guest that is very late.  Fucking late.  He wasn't booked for 10 o'clock.  If he was booked for 10 and then we left, wow, that's a major issue.  Right.  He was booked for 9.30 and he was fucking a half hour late.  It was pretty much 10 on the dot.  Yeah, see, that's when our show's over.  That is the end of the show and that is 30 minutes after.  And in fairness, they're not late for the shows like whether it's Leno or Letterman or others. 
[00:22:30]  But we don't even care if they're late.  A lot of times we will stay, but yesterday I couldn't.  That's fucking unbelievable.  Well, just undermining and coming up with these wacky ideas this afternoon thing.  Just, you know, we'll talk tomorrow about it, but just put the brakes on that.  No, that ain't fucking happening.  It's happening. 
[00:23:00]  That ain't fucking happening.  It is happening.  It's just going to hurt the show with listeners because there's fucking, we're going to lose nine hours a day.  Nine hours a day of fucking radio.  It's happening.  They don't want us to compete with Howard.  We have fucking built...  That's all it's about.  It's not even about...  It's happening.  We have built Morning Drive on this platform and this channel years, for years, we've built  up Morning Drive and an audience and everything.  And now we're just supposed to do this afternoon thing because he says so without any fucking  reason whatsoever. 
[00:23:30]  He's given me not one piece of a reason.  Well, it's because a lot of the guests will do Howard and not do us.  I'm thinking this.  Gives a shit.  That's my thought.  I don't care if we ever have another guest.  But again, I'm speculating.  Yeah.  And he knows what goes on behind the scenes over there.  They're smart.  Whatever they do to tie up the publicist, whatever.  They've built something good for them.  But we have problems getting certain guests.  So maybe if they weren't seeing this, we have to get out from under Howard's...  But I don't need to be...  I'm not afraid to go ahead.  If we lose, we lose.  We lose.  Let's stop, make or break this show.  This isn't a fucking, like, a guest talk show. 
[00:24:00]  It's not Oprah or fucking Today Show or whatever the fuck where they bring guests in.  We don't have to make this the fucking, what, media what?  Destination.  Destination.  This doesn't have to be a media destination.  It's a fucking conversational radio show.  And if guests want to come in and hang out, that's fine.  We're not going to sit and parade fucking guests through here all day and ask them about their books and their fucking movies and their TV shows. 
[00:24:30]  Who gives a flying cunt?  Well...  It's not what this show is about.  If you think it is, you know nothing about this fucking radio show and what we've been doing for years and years and years.  I think the Newt Gingrich interview was perfect.  I really do.  Shit.  We didn't shit on him.  He was happy with his appearance and we, or Jimmy, made it very entertaining.  And if he was in studio, he would have gotten a really great interview.  But that's, again, a ten-minute bullshit phoner.  We knew what that was.  Right?  Who cared? 
[00:25:00]  He would have gotten a great interview, but the listeners wouldn't have cared.  How about the rest of the fucking show that we did?  Well...  Aside from fucking the Newt Gingrich call.  How about that?  Nothing?  No?  You didn't fucking, you know, find anything worthwhile so that the Newt Gingrich thing had to be the downer for the whole show?  Jesus Christ.  Oh, it's old school radio.  You gotta keep the shows in line.  Exactly. 
[00:25:30]  We went through years of that.  We were done with that.  We would skip out of the studio like, oh man, that was another solid show.  And the listeners were digging it.  And then there was always someone waiting to yell at us.  Waiting to shit on us.  Just yell at us.  Every day.  How many times did we get yelled at a week at NEW?  Even though we were bringing in massive...  It seemed like it was a daily basis.  We were bringing in massive ratings and certainly massive revenue for the company.  But we would get yelled at.  We're getting yelled at for.  Twice a week?  Safe to say?  Yeah. 
[00:26:00]  It just seemed like a daily basis.  But I mean, I don't want to exaggerate.  But I would bet, on average, it was twice a week we would get yelled at.  Oh, fucking A.  Go home with fucking Agita.  Joe Rogan enjoys his podcast, man.  I swear to you.  What a fucking...  Oh, but you saw the setup.  It's amazing.  His setup out there, he's got his own little fucking building.  Like, it's awesome.  It's video.  It's fucking alive.  Yeah.  It feels current.  Well, we had a video element, you know, and we were ahead of everybody with that. 
[00:26:30]  But now everyone caught up and actually passed us by.  Most of the podcasts have video.  Yeah.  Corolla's got it.  Joe's got a bunch of them.  It was something we had, and we were developing nicely.  And there was certainly money to be made by that.  But they couldn't see money being made at the time, so they had to get rid of it.  Don't worry.  When we do our big event, it'll bring everyone together.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah, we're supposed to just skip down the hall and smile and wave to the people that 
[00:27:00]  are just fucking digging out from under the show until it just collapses.  Well, it got to a point where, you know, when I'm in here with you guys, I love it.  And then as soon as that door closes at 10 o'clock, I can't get out of here fast enough.  Right.  And I told Tim this the other day.  I'm like, look, we've heard so much from this company, and none of it has ever come true.  Wow.  So I know you're like a rah-rah guy right now, and you're motivated, and you see big things  for us on the channel. 
[00:27:30]  But I said, right now, it's really hard for us to see that because there's been a million  lies.  Yes.  You know, and the latest is, you know, Scott Greenstein begged us, said, we need a big  Opie and Anthony event.  So we finally figured out some of that and really made sense.  We blew off the bus tour because it wasn't organized, because we didn't have the right  people to organize that.  And then this event that we want to do would be kick-ass and big and over the top.  Oh, maybe because it costs the company too much money? 
[00:28:00]  Oh, that's right.  It won't cost them a dime.  Yeah, we didn't ask them.  Right, right, that's right.  We didn't ask them for a dime, but they're, well, the word extortion is being thrown around.  They want to put the hooks in.  So I don't get it.  My question to Greenstein is, you wanted a big event, you know, unlike the Howard event,  which is going to cost the company millions.  We handed over an event to you that's not going to cost you anything.  But please explain to me why now you want, it has to be said, I'm sorry, why you want 
[00:28:30]  a lot of money from us to do the event.  Yeah.  Explain that.  I don't get it.  Because you're about to spend millions more on Howard Stern.  Maybe that's why.  Maybe they want us to pay for Howard's party, like the fucking football players have to  pay for the dinners with the veterans.  You know, I mean, Howard has carved his fucking name in this business and, you know, obviously 
[00:29:00]  he gets the job done and he brings a lot of people to the table, but it's not good to  work with the guy because everyone else has to suffer.  Yeah.  It's not worth it.  Everyone suffers because they just throw all their money at him.  And like I said earlier, call it jealousy or whatever you have to do.  But if you're, you know, a Howard fan, you know, take advantage of this and fucking, you  know, call us jealous babies.  I don't care.  But the fact is, I saw this at CBS when we worked with a guy too. 
[00:29:30]  Everything else suffers.  They don't spend money on anybody else around here.  And unless you're a big A-lister, then they'll give you, you know, those people a shitload  of money too.  A-listers and Howard get all the money and everyone else kind of, you know, we all fucking  fight each other for the scraps.  I was all, I was all caught up in the old, what it was like when we used to go to fucking  YSP.  It was all fun.  Hey, it's Tim. 
[00:30:00]  Hey, how you doing?  Hey.  And then we'd go back to New York.  What he's just showing me.  And believe me, don't worry, Tim.  This isn't just me spouting on the air.  We'll, we'll, we'll chat about this during the big meeting tomorrow.  I've, I've had it already.  I've had it.  I've seen nothing but, but, but fucking, uh, lack of, of, of respect for me and my opinions  and what I say.  I guess that just goes out, out the fucking window.  You don't like the fact that you said you don't want to move to mornings and to afternoons  and it's just been ignored? 
[00:30:30]  Ignored.  And now it's being talked about like it's a fucking, uh, already in the works.  Why?  Like it's talking with people.  What is that about?  I have no idea.  Eric, do you know anything?  I can't fucking.  We're asking you.  So I think you're allowed to talk.  You rock.  I know they've scared the shit out of you guys.  Sorry about that.  Look at how beaten down these poor fucks are.  They're petrified.  Sam, who's never at a loss of words to stir the shit pot.  They're petrified.  Is having a problem this morning.  I spent a lot of time getting bosses mad at me. 
[00:31:00]  I finally have a new boss.  I don't know.  Get at it.  Eric, what are you saying?  I mean, it sounds like, uh, this thing is happening.  What do you know?  That's...  Was there someone in the meeting that said something like, like it's a done deal?  I'm not going to afternoons.  I'm not.  It's in my contract.  Deal with that.  Deal with that breach.  Fuckers.  You rock.  Comment.  Oh, boy. 
[00:31:30]  Look.  I know.  Give us the information.  They're beaten down.  Yeah, you guys are just telling us what happened in the meeting that maybe we should have been  there for.  He rocks in there.  It looks like one of those fucking abused dogs on those commercials.  But I think it's safe to say anything said in the meeting you could say here to us.  Because you were meeting about us at the Opie and Anthony show.  Us meaning all of us.  So what was said in the meeting?  The impression was made that this was happening. 
[00:32:00]  How was the impression made?  And to who?  Right.  There you go.  What was said in the meeting?  We're asking about stuff that was said in the meeting.  Not stuff that maybe was in conference or in the hall or all that shit.  It was an actual meeting.  Yeah.  On the docket.  But we were talking about different ways to improve the show in different aspects.  And somebody that wasn't part of our staff had said, you know, when you move to afternoon.  So we all kind of went.  How will that be better for the show? 
[00:32:30]  How?  Well, that's how.  Give me one fuck reason.  How?  How that's good for this program.  That's what I asked him.  I said, look, I have an open mind, but you got to explain to me how it's going to work.  We can't just do it.  There's nothing that can explain to me why nine hours of being on the radio across two countries  is taken away.  That's almost half the day.  How is that helpful to a fucking radio show?  How?  That's what I've asked him to explain.  I've heard nothing.  He'll explain that any day now. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Well, I better get an explanation tomorrow at the meeting.  And I better get the impression that all of our opinion on this subject matters and is  taken into consideration and fucking and things aren't going on behind the scenes that  are completely contradictory to everything I've said to him already in whatever meetings  we've had.  He knows my fucking opinion on afternoon drive and Jimmy's and opie's. 
[00:33:30]  He knows all of our opinions on afternoon drive.  But apparently, what?  You don't give a shit?  You don't care what the actual show thinks?  Is that it?  Boy, that's a good way to fucking muster up some trust in this little relationship, isn't  it?  Somebody's Twittering me saying, hey, I'm not trying to be a douche, but how are you losing  nine hours if you go to afternoons?  The way we are is because we're on right now at 6 a.m.  Yeah. 
[00:34:00]  So we get the brand new info from a radio standpoint right now that we've got four newspapers with  all sorts of new shit in it, brand new stuff happening on TV.  So at 6 a.m.  We get to hit you up with all the new stuff.  Sure.  So what Jimmy's saying is if we move to, and Anthony, if we move to afternoons, you  don't get the new shit until three in the afternoon.  So from 6 a.m.  To three, that would sound possibly old.  I think it would sound old.  Why would you listen?  And that's what I told Tim.  I go, that's the issue here. 
[00:34:30]  It's got to make sense from 6 a.m.  to three.  And then I would kind of maybe be into it just because my lifestyle would be better.  I don't like getting up at 4.30.  But I said from 6 a.m.  to three, that's got to sound fresh and new to the people.  It won't.  They want to put somebody else in the morning, or they want to do some bullshit clip wraparound  show, which nobody will listen to.  Then everybody will go and listen to the other show, and they will listen to Stern, and then  that will be good.  I told you. 
[00:35:00]  And that's the ultimate goal.  He doesn't, he's not moving another show onto this channel.  That would be a, then he would be lying to our face, because I flat out ask that.  Well, whether he's moving it to another channel or not, or he wants another one of his morning  shows to do better, so he's getting us out of the way.  Whatever it is, there's an ulterior motive here that isn't being brought up because he  hasn't even come up with a good reason to put us in afternoons.  So there's something not being said here.  And as far as, could you imagine right now, listeners out there, hello in Radioland, you're 
[00:35:30]  listening right now to something that happened yesterday at ten minutes of four in the afternoon,  and that's what you're listening to right now, because it's being replayed, because we're  not live in the mornings.  And by the way, you've probably already listened to it, because you're driving home, or you're  that, so you've listened to this already.  And now you're listening to a replay the next day of yesterday's show.  In what fucking galaxy is that a good idea? 
[00:36:00]  It's a step back, and it stinks.  It's a demotion to go from mornings to afternoon drive.  And I hate giving up.  I fucking hate it.  I hate it, too.  Believe me.  I'm an insomniac.  I have sleep apnea.  I'm a crud.  I hate it, but I'll tell you one thing.  So let's do this, then.  No, the bigger picture is more important.  It hurts the show.  It makes us irrelevant, even more so than we are.  I don't like getting up this early, either.  If you don't like getting up this early, then this is perfect for us.  Because nobody likes getting up early.  Nobody does.  This is perfect.  I'd rather fucking... 
[00:36:30]  Suffer?  Get up early.  Yes!  I'd rather suffer.  I would rather get it over with.  And then fucking you take a nap, and you got the whole day, then, to do whatever you  want, and that's your life.  It will make the show even less...  It will make the show smaller.  The audience it reaches is smaller, and that still matters.  I don't look at this like I'm in the final fucking...  The golden years of my career, and I want to end it.  I'm 45.  I'm going to be doing this, hopefully, for another fucking 40 years.  What?  I'm performing. 
[00:37:00]  Right.  This is not a fucking 9 to 5 I'm going to retire from.  This is all I ever wanted to do.  I'm not looking for it to be easier or to do less of it.  It's fucking easy.  We chat.  Exactly.  God almighty, there's so many shit jobs out there that we don't have to do.  I don't want to lose nine hours so I can sleep a little more.  I don't need more sleep.  I'll die sooner or later.  Believe me.  My LA trip, a disaster.  Leno was great.  Nothing to do with the show.  Right, right.  Just the other meeting I was supposed to have. 
[00:37:30]  Once again, blown off.  You know, I hate this fucking business so much.  This fucking, I hate it.  All elements of it I hate.  The performing part is fantastic.  And the fans I love.  Yeah, yeah, that's great.  But then you get these people that just got to throw their monkey wrenches into the works.  Just leave it alone.  Could you just fucking leave what's working alone?  Wow, a lot of people want us to move to afternoons. 
[00:38:00]  Do they?  Yep.  Yeah, sure.  I think his goal is to bring the show to the next level.  Nice.  Cool.  I like that.  Yeah, from where we are now, mediocre to totally irrelevant.  Yeah, exactly.  To totally irrelevant.  You're right.  How about this?  How about just helping us get some promotion?  Like, that's how you help the show.  How about helping us get some kind of a video?  That's how you help the show.  That's the shit we need.  How about standing in the way of our events?  For the record.  We did talk in the meeting.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:38:30]  About adding video.  Mm-hmm.  About equipping the studio with cameras.  Wow.  About moving the show so it was on one channel across both platforms.  It's all stuff we've talked about for years.  Yeah, it's talk is cheap.  Oh, my God.  Talk is cheap.  That was also discussed.  Okay, cool.  Great.  I think the tube said it best.  Talk to you later.  Don't want to hear it again tonight.  That's right.  Talk is cheap at this point.  That's kind of the point I made with Tim.  I'm like, we've heard it all.  And we talked to...  Talk, talk!  We've heard it all at this point.  All you do to me is talk, talk! 
[00:39:00]  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  This place is very good at talking.  We talked to the web team about helping promote the show and getting it out.  Oh, wonderful!  Great job!  Blogs and SoundClouds and YouTubes.  The fucking Obamacare web people laugh at the web people here.  We will lose.  We will look like such fucking cunts if we go to after...  It will look like, hey, man, the big guy...  And again, how is a bigger show?  And I don't care.  I don't either.  I sincerely don't give a shit.  It doesn't bother me. 
[00:39:30]  It doesn't frighten me.  We do.  I don't give a...  I make good money considering my ability level.  So I'm happy to fuck it.  I would love to make more...  This is a fucking cakewalk of a gig.  We do morning drive radio.  That's what we were hired to do.  In two countries!  That's what we were hired to do.  That's what we do.  We worked our way up to morning radio from afternoons.  That's how it works.  I think the vision is instead of being number two in mornings, being number one in afternoons. 
[00:40:00]  I don't give a fuck about being number two in morning.  It doesn't mean anything to me.  I don't care.  My pal, Buzzy, who's an old, dear friend of mine.  We've been friends since we were 18 years old.  So about 25 years.  Okay.  Well, I mean...  So let's have a slide?  Yeah, I mean...  About 25 years.  And he's in the media business.  Big fucking time, okay?  I was a radio guy.  He was a TV guy.  That's why we initially hit it off. 
[00:40:30]  And I think he nails it here.  I think this is basically the point.  But they don't want to tell us this.  They want subscribers to listen to Howard in the morning and ONA in the afternoon.  Fresh content in both day parts.  Yeah, well...  Too bad.  Too bad.  Exactly.  You get fresh shit in the morning.  You get fresh shit in the morning.  And then you get fresh shit in the afternoon.  But that isn't being told to us.  Everyone is saying do a podcast. 
[00:41:00]  That makes complete sense.  Everyone is saying that.  Do a podcast.  No, I'm going to go raise some kids for a while.  Have fun, though.  I'll check in every week.  I would love to.  Honestly, God, dude.  I love this gig.  And I literally am thinking about...  I want to get equipment to just do a fucking podcast.  Or do the one you...  Yes.  I really do.  And it's not to motherfuck the company.  I just can't stand this shit.  Like, well, I mean...  Dishonesty.  You know, we know...  We saw what it could be when we're...  It's the same shit, but... 
[00:41:30]  I mean, when we were at XM, we were the main guys.  And we were treated way differently.  Especially with Eric Logan.  And then as soon as we got, you know, through the merger and moved over here,  it's painfully obvious that all they give a fuck about Howard,  keep him happy, and everything else, you know,  it doesn't really matter.  I don't...  I enjoy the fucking dishonesty coming from down the hall.  What do you mean?  I don't enjoy that.  There...  It's blatant dishonesty as to what's going on. 
[00:42:00]  Well...  Tim takes the reins of this show away from the Three Stooges  and then is doing things behind the show's back.  And there's a reason for it that isn't being told to us.  More dishonesty.  There's this thing that's going on where he's doing things  that we said we don't want done already behind the scenes.  Where is this coming from?  I had a theory that I've said behind the scenes 
[00:42:30]  and everyone thinks I'm fucking crazy.  But I'm not crazy.  What?  I don't want to say it on the air,  but I told you before the show what my theory is.  Yeah.  And it's like with my manager.  I tell Jonathan,  I sniff this fucking shit out  and he thinks I'm nuts and I'm right.  What theory, though?  Write it down.  Which one?  Because I know a thing or two as well, you know.  Yes.  If it's the moving another show on, that's...  No, I'm telling you.  Let me... 
[00:43:00]  Without...  I am almost convinced.  You're hearing brutal.  I'm sorry.  Oh, no.  Come on.  Nope.  I know it sounds crazy.  I know it does.  But I'm watching what's happening.  I guarantee it.  It's something like that.  It's not...  You don't...  And again,  I fucking loved him.  I really...  For real.  You don't come on to a brand new show  and then immediately  want to just fucking fold it up 
[00:43:30]  and move it to afternoons.  Yeah.  What?  Because you think Howard gets better guests  and they're kind of blocked from coming on here?  That's very frustrating sometimes.  But you know what?  Roland is so fucking good.  And I really mean this.  We get most of the guys we want.  Of course.  And we had Patrice  and we get Bill Burr  and we got fucking Louis  and we get Amy.  Right, right.  We got the funniest people in the country.  There are a few we don't get.  The majority of great comedians we get.  Yep.  This show isn't fucking contingent 
[00:44:00]  on having A-listers come through here  all fucking morning.  That's not what we do.  That's not our show.  Most of the A-listers are whatever.  Bores.  It's kind of fun to see a guy  that's really famous.  You're like,  holy fuck, there he is.  You do it with me every day, dude.  Come on, you're back.  What makes him think  that that's what we want?  We've never indicated  that we want to have  a celebrity talk show  and that's what  the Opie and Anthony show is.  I think we have too many guests.  And to blow it up  in the mornings  and relocate to afternoons  just because of a guest thing 
[00:44:30]  is ludicrous  because that's not what our show is.  It's about something else.  We want to change the show.  Exactly.  So that leads me to believe  there's some ulterior motive here.  Yeah, we could all get more sleep.  Ugh.  That means something, doesn't it?  No.  But then the afternoons would suck.  Like, you know,  sleeping later,  the nights you don't sleep  and then you gotta,  it would be awful.  You can't do anything  because you gotta go to work  at fucking three.  You gotta be in  to do a show at three.  Well, if you live  a healthy lifestyle,  you could do a lot. 
[00:45:00]  Not really.  You got, you're like,  We're done by 10 a.m.  How do you work out there?  You can go for a nice bike ride.  Oh, Jesus.  And look at the leaves.  This is an easy gig.  You go bowling.  Bowling.  In the morning.  Here's what I would do.  I would sleep  until fucking two.  Really?  And then do the show  and then I'd be seven o'clock  until fucking noon.  I'd be up  and then I'd try to sleep.  It would just  wouldn't fucking...  But you would have a life  where you wouldn't have  to deal with hangovers.  That would be cool. 
[00:45:30]  No.  I don't really deal  with hangovers that much.  No.  No.  That's all just a...  No, weekdays.  Fucking,  if I have two beers  at night,  it's a fucking lot.  We'll have some fucking fun  though in the afternoon.  Do some events  like the old days.  We can have girls in.  Oh, yeah.  We'll have girls in.  Okay, girls.  Keep your clothes on,  of course.  Clap your hands.  Yeah, yeah.  Yay!  Keep it nice.  Everyone clapped.  New content at 6.30 p.m.  All the girls clapped.  Yeah.  Well, of course,  we have to tell them 
[00:46:00]  days beforehand  that we're having people  up for a spontaneous event.  We can't just say,  hey, show up at the studio.  No.  It's not...  It's not the old days, Tim.  We should tap out  after this contract, finally.  Might be fucking viable.  We should just tap out.  It's time to tap out.  I just...  What do we got?  11 months left?  11 months.  Damn, this fucking...  We should just tap out.  This horse shit.  Because we...  I mean, you can only  bitch so much  before people look at you 
[00:46:30]  like you're a big fucking pussy  because you're not, like,  taking care of your own situation.  Yeah.  You know, if you yell  and scream like this every day  but you don't do anything about it,  you really look...  You really look dumb.  Yeah.  I think it might be time to tap out.  We've given them, like,  nine years.  We've been in this building  four and a half, I think.  Fire up the old...  And we can't get...  Podcast.  Like Jimmy says,  we're stuck in mud.  We literally can't get anything done.  And then we do exactly  what the company asked.  They want a big event.  We handed them a big event. 
[00:47:00]  I think it would be really cool.  And it could be something  that we could do annually.  And...  Just crawl on it like leeches.  And, of course...  Suck the lifeblood from it.  I didn't even get a good explanation  why, you know...  They don't even want to do the event.  But now, if we do...  If we want to move forward  with the event,  it's going to...  It's going to cost...  It's going to cost us.  But then we're supposed to smile  and fucking, you know...  Just be the little puppets. 
[00:47:30]  Can you get podcast...  Podquest...  Can you get any of that  podcast equipment,  really good stuff,  into the city?  Yeah.  No, because he has got stuff  in his house.  But can any of that stuff  be used in the city?  Because we'll never get  fucking people  to go out to Long Island.  Not that it's all about guests,  but, like,  you need something in New York.  It's very easy to just  get by podcast equipment  and fucking...  You do what Bobby's doing.  You find a spot  where people want you there.  Right.  And you build your own little thing  like Joe Rogan did.  Yeah.  You know, Bobby has a cool  little thing above the comedy 
[00:48:00]  cellar, more or less.  And a room that's not being used.  And it just couches...  It looks like a fraternity room.  It's cool as shit.  I know exactly where we could...  And I'm not kidding you.  I know exactly...  It's like a 90-se...  seat theater.  We wanted an audience  so we could have...  I know exactly where  we could do it.  Yeah.  To fucking theater.  I've shot something at it already.  Yeah.  Ooh.  It's got a fucking  beautiful riser seats.  Or at Ford's Theater.  Yes.  It's kind of time.  I want to see a play there.  Yes.  It really is time  because, like I said,  I'm going to say it again,  you can't just bitch 
[00:48:30]  and complain every day  without doing something about it.  I never threaten to leave.  I never, ever do that.  I never say a walkie.  It's not even a threat to leave.  It's like...  I think if we leave,  they wouldn't even care.  Oh, they'll allow it.  Of course.  They don't give a fuck.  At this point.  They've shown they don't give a fuck.  As long as they got Howard,  this place is going to  continue to run smoothly.  You know?  And that's a fact.  I'm pretty fair with  what I say about the guy.  You know,  I don't like Howard at all.  Everyone knows that.  But I understand that he,  you know,  he gets the job done. 
[00:49:00]  You know?  And as long as they got him,  they'll be fine.  How disappointing.  And that's why they throw him  a huge birthday bash,  even though he tried  to sue the company  for like hundreds of millions  of dollars, I think.  I think it was for another  hundred million or something.  He sued the company.  We get threatened  with being fired  by just bitching  about the company.  He actually sued them.  And now he's being rewarded  with another fucking big,  huge bash  and more of the company's 
[00:49:30]  resources being,  you know,  pushed towards him.  Yeah, we get bitched at  for fucking leaving  when we're supposed to.  Right.  Right.  I can't tell you  how disappointed I am.  I thought when Tim came aboard  it was going to be  something different.  He's still trying to get  things together.  It's different, all right.  It's different, all right.  I see this fucking  complete lack of fucking  transparency.  Well,  at least we got de Blasio 
[00:50:00]  as the mayor.  There you go.  So we're good.  There you go.  Wow, I got to find  a house immediately, huh?  You should get out  of New York  like everybody else  that makes any money.  Get the fuck out  of New York.  We have just hired  what could easily  be the worst mayor  in New York City history.  He's a professor.  And I know he hasn't even,  I know he hasn't even  been on the job a day yet.  First Democratic mayor  elected since the 80s.  Since who?  Dinkins?  Dinkins.  Right?  Yeah.  Was he, what was he, 
[00:50:30]  88?  He was elected in the 80s.  The economy was shaky  when he came in, though.  Everything was shaky  because it was  a fucking clusterfuck.  Crime was rampant.  And then between  Giuliani and Bloomberg,  a lot of people  had problems  with both of them  personally,  with their personal  little foibles.  liberals, but you can't  argue what they did  for New York City  as far as cleaning it up  and getting tourism up  and murder down  and crime down. 
[00:51:00]  It's amazing.  And now you get this guy.  I guess people have had  enough of, you know,  prosperity in New York  because you get this guy  and he's talking about,  you know,  all kinds of,  all kinds of,  bringing everybody up.  Right.  Here's the problem.  You don't ever bring  everybody up.  The people that you're  trying to bring up  usually hold down  the people that would  have gone up.  And he got elected  because his kid  has an afro.  His kid's afro.  You do know that, right?  He's the afro mayor. 
[00:51:30]  In the end,  he's the mayor  of New York City  because his kid  has an afro.  Afro, that spot  where he said,  because he's my dad.  That really spoke to people.  Yeah.  I was kind of saying  it on Twitter last night.  There's not a politician  alive that will  significantly change  the life of a  middle-class citizen.  No.  No.  These politicians  either help  the very wealthy  or the poor.  Yeah.  And in the middle  is the middle class 
[00:52:00]  and they get  completely screwed  by every single  politician out there.  That's why it  amazes me that  the middle class  runs out there  and votes every election.  The middle class  is the money generator.  The middle class  is the money generator.  Not significantly.  No.  Your life isn't  going to change  drastically because  you pulled the lever  for a Republican  or a Democrat.  Period.  But if you're  very wealthy  or if you're  very poor,  it makes all  the difference  who's in there.  He was talking  last night  giving his speech  there, 
[00:52:30]  de Blasio,  about  taking money  from the rich,  taxing the rich,  giving it to  education.  Yeah,  the poor's  going to make out  very well  with this guy.  Yeah,  and all the people  that were behind him,  wow.  It was every race.  There was a woman  in a burka.  There was a woman  in a sari.  There was black people.  There were Asians.  Every possible  ethnic background 
[00:53:00]  was behind him.  Right.  And,  oh,  they loved him.  And he had  progress  and progressive  all over.  He likes saying  progressive.  I think we're going  to progress  right to  what happens  when there's  usually a Democratic  mayor in office.  Right.  I always say  that sometimes  time has to tell.  You could never  tell full time.  Oh,  okay.  You know,  you got a lot of time  to do what it does.  Yeah,  sure you do.  I should go about it.  I'm shickling about it  right now.  Well,  the good thing, 
[00:53:30]  do we have  de Blasio's  victory speech?  Maybe we should break.  Maybe we should break  and do a little  election coverage.  All right,  we'll do that  because there's been  some big news  in Detroit.  Wow,  there is.  First time in 40 years?  40 years.  Jimmy.  White mayor  for the first time  in Detroit  in 40 years  and the populace  is what,  82% black,  I believe.  If I did my  reading correctly.  We'll talk some  election shit next.  Also today, 
[00:54:00]  Dr. J coming in.  I read his book.  It's very good.  I read your book.  I read excerpts.  Did you?  Yeah, I did.  I read a hundred  and something pages  yesterday  except why would  I sleep on the plane  in a big life flat seat?  Fucking nervous faggot  just sitting there  itching.  Itchy legs.  Because I'm worthless  on all levels.  Oh, Jimmy.  No sleeping,  valueless,  fucking soon to leave  cunt,  wide awake,  bug-eyed,  meeting canceled on,  hunk of shit.  That's why we gotta 
[00:54:30]  go to afternoon  so Jimmy gets more sleep.  It won't do me any good.  I'll fucking go to bed  at six in the morning  and I'll fucking wake up  and it'll be a disaster  there too.  Everything just  fucking shifts.  Wherever I went,  there I was.  Cuntboy is everywhere  and I am doing  my advice show today.  Oh, good.  And I can go home  and sleep  doing Bob Kelly's podcast  tonight.  Nice.  The Miller's Underground  is live  with Bailey J.  Oh, wow.  She's gonna fuck my face  in front of an audience.  Not my mouth though,  that'd be gay,  my ears.  Bailey's gonna fuck  my ears.  Good thing I'm out 
[00:55:00]  in the afternoon.  I could just say it  and head right out  to the podcast.  Right, right.  We're gonna talk  about de Blasio.  We're gonna talk  about Governor Christie  there.  Oh, yeah.  He ain't gonna take  shit from no one,  that guy.  Watch out.  his schmaltzy speech.  That was pretty schmaltzy.  Why?  He's your guy.  He's got an R  after his name.  You like those guys.  He's a little schmaltzy.  You think?  Yeah.  Those hugs.  Oh.  Do we have excerpts 
[00:55:30]  from this?  I want to hear  the hugs part  of the speech.  Because it's all...  We'll get into it  fully after the break.  I just...  My headline is always,  it's all just bullshit.  All fucking horse shite.  Let's give each other  a little head.  Oh, right.  Wow.  It's not even my birthday.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:56:00]  Sirius XM.  XM.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:56:30]  She won't even miss me  when she's gone.  That's okay with me.  I'll cry later on.  Mm-hmm.  And you'll be in six months.  She has...  All right, enough.  Talk to you later, right? 
[00:57:00]  Wow.  Hi, Jack.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We referenced the song.  Don't you like the tubes?  I never really liked the tubes.  I liked their little hits.  They were catchy little giddies.  They only had a couple, right?  What was the other hit?  Su-su-sushi.  No, they had that other one.  They had su-sushi.  What was the big one they had?  What do you mean they had su-sushi?  That was su-sushi.  You're kidding, right?  That was a little deep.  No.  Yeah.  Is that in the system?  Should be.  Not that I'm seeing.  It was terrible.  You're not talking about Su-su-sudio, are you?  No, no. 
[00:57:30]  It was su-sushi.  And then there was the other one.  There is one more that used to be played on radio.  Yeah.  Is there white in the title?  No.  White Punks on Dope?  Yeah, I think that was one.  But it's a live version.  She's a beauty.  She's a beauty.  Okay.  That was it.  She's a beauty.  Actually, I like that one the best.  Give us a little she's a beauty.  You know what, Bob?  I almost fired out when you said, what's the other song?  I almost said California Roll.  Oh.  But now you did say it. 
[00:58:00]  That's bad.  Yeah, you did say it now.  Yeah, this is their big hit.  Terrible joke.  This is the one on MTV.  This was a big MTV song.  Big MTV video.  And they had to blur out the nipple on the little car the kid was driving around in.  A lot of MTV guys walk around this joint.  Yeah.  Sway.  The Heather B.  Oh, yeah.  Man, Heather B. is a very cool lady.  Oh, yeah.  She the black lady?  Yeah, wasn't she?  Wasn't she an issue on the real world New York back in the day? 
[00:58:30]  Because she couldn't be nicer.  I don't know.  She was kind of cool on that show.  Was she cool on the show?  You're confusing her with Tammy.  I know Tammy.  Tammy was terrible.  I watch Basketball Wives.  Yeah, she's so proud.  Tammy is a good.  Sam knows.  He watches, too.  You want to see some good TV.  You want to see a real bitch on wheels.  It's that Tammy brought from L.A. real world.  I'm all about the black ink. 
[00:59:00]  I think it's called black ink.  What is that?  It's just about black people with tattoos who have a tattoo store, but they just get into  fights all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  Because, I don't know.  I guess it's a very dramatic lifestyle to be a black person.  Because no one can see their tattoos.  Yeah.  So you get pissed off that they spent all the money.  It's very frustrating.  That's why they have to do that branding shit.  Oh, man.  You can see a good branding.  Crazy, though.  Like, there's always, like, one guy who's like, yeah, they were making fun of me, and  that's all well and good, but I'm stressed out because I've got to go to jail in a week. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, okay.  All these problems.  Yeah.  That's relatable.  Yeah.  Reverend Al said that there's more black people in prison than in school.  Oh, yeah?  Mm-hmm.  I guess that's a problem with what?  The judicial system.  Ah, yeah.  That's what he said last night.  Yeah, it is.  So we had elections yesterday, and, you know, I would love to talk to the people that voted  for de Blasio. 
[01:00:00]  I don't think we know those people.  No.  Whatsoever, but he had a massive victory, and he's now the mayor of New York City, which  is, I can't see how that's going to be a good thing in the end.  I guess 20-some-odd years of, you know, pretty much prosperity.  A couple of tragedies in there.  There are a few missteps, but for the most part, you look back 20 years at New York City  and look at it now.  Right.  Big difference for the better, I think.  I think he'll go down as one of the worst fucking mayors ever. 
[01:00:30]  And he hasn't even done the job yet.  He hasn't done anything yet.  I just can't see.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  You can't run a...  Every time a text message comes in.  Oh, God.  I wasn't the problem today.  Let the record show I was not the problem today.  Please.  Thank you.  I don't consider myself the problem either.  I was addressing the problem.  No, but there are a lot of times I don't consider myself the problem either.  But guess what?  You're the problem today.  I'll be in there. 
[01:01:00]  This will be spawned that you're the problem.  Okay.  That's fine by me.  I'm fine with it.  But make sure they know I was in the problem today.  Yeah.  I laughed a lot during the first hour.  I'm fine with it.  Um, so de Blasio is in New York City.  Yeah.  You got Christie there in Jersey.  Uh-huh.  These acceptance speeches were just ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  And a lot of them are ending it with,  And just remember, I work for you.  For you. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, sure you do.  Get the fuck out of here.  You don't work for me.  Martin Walsh.  Martin Walsh.  Mega mighty from fucking Boston.  Mayor Matty.  That's a big thing right there.  Menino's out.  Menino is done.  He's been there forever.  Mm-hmm.  That's a sad day.  Yeah.  It's amazing he's been the mayor since we left Boston.  I hope he gives a good, you know, farewell speech.  Has he?  Not to my knowledge.  As I depart. 
[01:02:00]  The office of Mayor of Boston.  Everyone's on to the Mayor Menino thing now.  Oh, I love it.  And the DNN had their montage.  Yeah.  We got that.  Maybe we can find it in the back office.  Is Sal capable of doing that, you think?  Well, I mean.  Sal, you think you can find a clip for us?  Sure.  All right.  Keep panic.  You think you said clip?  Oh, yeah.  He's like, I don't know where that is.  It's an ESPN montage. 
[01:02:30]  Montee.  Of all the Menino silliness.  And then you got the first white mayor in Detroit.  These are the headlines from the elections.  Bankrupt Detroit.  Bankrupt Detroit.  First white mayor in 40 years.  40 years.  Detroit's just been rife with corruption over the course of 40 years.  So we'll see if Whitey gets in there and does anything different.  Well, let's start with...  He's already panicking.  Is he?  Well, he's like, well, you know, we can all work together. 
[01:03:00]  Let's just turn the whole city into a farm.  This isn't about skin color or...  Low expectations?  Oh, he's just trying to keep his head.  Right.  I think.  Let's start with de Blasio's victory speech.  We got that.  And then we got to get the gov.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Governor Christie.  Christie.  With his schmaltzy speech.  He's a bit on the pompous side.  It was a little...  He doesn't take any guff, though.  Watch out.  Oh, no.  Watch out. 
[01:03:30]  Not a bit of guff.  I don't want to get him mad.  But he loves getting hugs.  Oh, yeah.  During disaster.  The hug part of the speech was so douchey.  It was, right?  Yeah.  I don't know what they're supposed to say, but...  Yeah, true.  I don't know.  One of those hugs got my prick hard.  Yeah.  Not much you can say.  Let's get the de Blasio.  All right.  Every joke I tell now, I'm like, I hope Tim likes that.  Oh.  I hope he likes that.  For a new direction for our city.  New direction. 
[01:04:00]  Uh-oh.  United.  Pause.  By a belief that our city should leave...  But why a new direction?  Because...  I look around like crime is way the fuck down.  Right.  Buildings going up.  I walk around a lot.  Business.  The city is in a good direction.  Why do we need a new direction?  What's wrong with the direction?  How about less bikes?  Yeah, they are.  They're fucking ruining traffic.  What's the problem with the direction?  Well, he would lead you to believe that the direction is bad because there are... 
[01:04:30]  There is a very divided New York.  There are the very wealthy and the very poor.  And he wants to bring everyone up.  He wants the wealthy to cough up money so that everyone has the opportunity to build  themselves up.  That trick never works.  That's fucking...  Never...  Good old fashioned communism.  Never works when you force people to give up their money.  No, you force people to give up their money.  You just make a lot of bitter people. 
[01:05:00]  To try to give it to other people that perhaps don't have the wherewithal to levitate themselves  to that same level of success.  I do my share.  I gave a homeless guy a fiver yesterday.  Nice.  Usually it's just a dollar or some change if I got it in my pocket.  I went for a fiver yesterday.  I was feeling good.  Good bottle of wine he could go with that.  That's right.  Sure.  Let's go with de Blasio.  So, all right.  The first problem I have with this is the new direction. 
[01:05:30]  New direction.  I think the city's running very well right now.  And as much as we bitched about him, Bloomberg did a damn good job.  Yes, she did.  There was a bunch of dumb things he did.  But in general, the city is in a very good direction.  Here's why, too.  Because he was...  It wasn't...  He is a businessman.  He knows business.  Right.  And he knows...  The thing is, business isn't just making money with the city.  You know what makes good business.  What makes good business is tourism.  And what makes good tourism is the fact that you don't have rampant crime. 
[01:06:00]  So, he knows all those things are very good for the city.  This guy is such a wacky progressive and really sees the world through those rose-colored  glasses of these stupid liberal progressives.  And, I don't know.  I think he's going to be very detrimental to New York City.  He'll suck.  Let's see what else happens here.  No New Yorker behind.  Some wannabe left behind. 
[01:06:30]  They're lazy bums.  We're proud of what we've accomplished on this campaign.  And we're humbled by it.  And let me say to all of you, from the bottom of my heart, thank you.  Thank you for all you've done.  Thank you.  Oh, thank you.  I haven't done anything yet.  The one thing, like a lot of politicians use that no person left behind thing.  Yeah.  And this might be brutal to hear, but America was based on the fact that people are going 
[01:07:00]  to be left behind.  Yeah.  We're not based on the fact that everyone's got the same level.  You don't want to kick them in the fucking gutter and put them in a shantytown, but that's  what this country is built on.  You are going to leave people behind.  Opportunities, not guarantees.  That's what America is all about.  And that's the only way it really works in a capitalist society.  You can't have everybody at the same level.  First of all, you just can't do it.  It doesn't work out mathematically.  Secondly, there are some people that can't achieve that level of success and equilibrium. 
[01:07:30]  So let's stop saying it's a capitalistic society, because it's not.  Yeah, we're not.  We're not.  Because every politician is using this no one left behind thing.  I know.  I don't want anyone suffering.  But the fact is, you've got to leave people behind.  That's just how it works.  You ever hear about the baby turtles, though?  Oh, boy.  I used to love that analogy.  I mean, look what he just did.  He just ran an election and left other candidates behind.  Oh, shit.  He just did that.  Yes. 
[01:08:00]  That's how he got where he is, by fucking competing and leaving other people behind.  That's how it works.  Well, that's America.  Competition.  Maybe we don't want to acknowledge that.  You know, we want to put on the rose-colored glasses.  But that's why this country has been successful.  You've got a whole bunch of people that prosper.  And do you know how much money goes to it?  They always say, we need more money for education.  Do you know how much money goes to education?  There's a lot of fucking money in schools and teachers.  Well, we're closing schools down constantly. 
[01:08:30]  Nah.  He's, oh, boy.  He's ready to appoint, like, a former teacher's union to the head of the Department of Education.  It's just looking.  All right, let's keep going.  But let me be clear.  Oh.  Our work, all of our work, is really just beginning.  That means he's got to tear down everything that Bloomberg did. 
[01:09:00]  We have no illusions about the task that lies ahead.  What task?  It's run the city.  Tasking inequality isn't easy.  Oh, inequality.  It never has been and it never will be.  The challenges we face have been decades in the making.  Challenges.  And the problems we set out to address will not be solved overnight.  But make no mistake.  The people of this city have chosen a progressive path. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, God.  That word progressive is not good.  That means crime.  And tonight we set forth on it.  A lot of red.  A lot of red in that picture.  I noticed that, too.  Yeah.  I guess I noticed that.  Tommy red.  Estamos muy orgullosos.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  It's a secret code to blow something up. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  This Spanish sucks.  Well, another Bloomberg.  How long are you to do it for?  He's fanatically.  It's like Marjana's Spanish.  It's horrible.  Taco Bell Grande.  All right. 
[01:10:30]  How long are you to do it?  El Camino.  There's a lot of Hispanics in New York.  I know.  He's progressive, see?  Oh.  Wouldn't their lives be a lot better if they knew English?  Yeah.  Of course it would be.  Of course.  That's progressive, though.  Is he done?  Let's hope, man.  To everyone who knocked on doors, made phone calls, persuaded your friends. 
[01:11:00]  Oh, boy.  The pointing at the people in the audience.  Hey, I know that, dude.  Right there.  See the globe.  See the globe.  See the globe.  This victory is yours.  Oh, is it?  Can I stay at the fucking mansion?  Thank you so much.  That's a shitty acceptance speech, by the way.  Very short.  Terrible.  Shitty. 
[01:11:30]  Just they're all trite, these speeches.  No, he gave a longer run.  I think that's just a piece of it.  I remember him talking more about equality and stop and frisk and stuff.  And the police department that has to learn that it has to get along with the communities and stuff.  So, yeah, I see some trouble between the police and this mayor.  She is a midget.  How small is that broad?  That's the House of Horrors girl.  Maybe it's being chained up, stunted her growth. 
[01:12:00]  But she looks like she might be four foot tall.  Maybe even shorter.  Where is she?  They just showed her.  She was on Dr. Phil just talking more about the horrors.  Cock sucker.  Yeah.  The horrors of the House of Horrors.  The guy should kill himself.  He should punch her in the stomach.  He knocked her five times and would punch her in the stomach.  It worked?  Yeah.  Wow.  What a piece of shit.  He should have just had his throat cut.  I mean, I'm glad he's dead, but I kind of wish he had his throat cut.  Yeah.  Right.  He's not suffering anymore.  Exactly, yeah.  So that was de Blasio, and then you got the gov. 
[01:12:30]  You got the gov talking about the hugs?  Oh, yeah.  Hi.  All right.  This is so busy.  Hug a pizza.  It's so douchey.  He's just douchey.  New Jerseyans will never leave any New Jerseyans behind.  Jerseyans.  Oh, what does that mean?  See, that leave behind thing.  Leave behind.  Stop saying New Jerseyans are different than other state people.  Right, right, right.  He wants us to think he's different than all the other politicians, but he's using the  same rhetoric.  I hate when they make their state look like, we want New Hampshireans to feel, let's show 
[01:13:00]  you what New Hampshireans are made of.  The same shit as Floridians and Utahans.  I was left behind many times in my life.  I didn't need a fucking politician to lift me up.  I wish Sirius would say no morning show left behind.  Yeah, exactly.  What the fuck?  Yeah, what is this left behind?  The state stuff bugs me.  Let's show them what Las Vegasans are made of. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah!  We're Nevadaans!  I was going to say, Nevada.  But I mean, don't act like you're made of any mustard.  Everyone is the same here.  Yeah, of course.  Let's show them what Mississippians do.  A lot different than Rhode Islanders.  Dreck.  New Jerseyans.  A dreck.  We're not going to lay down and take it, because that's not what New Jerseyans do.  If you throw pie at New Jerseyans, we pick it up and say, more pie, we're tough! 
[01:14:00]  That's how Michiginians do things.  It's safe to say, human nature, if a big fucking storm happens, or a terrorist attack, or wildfires,  or whatever the fuck, everyone kind of steps up their game.  Right.  Yeah.  And they start loving each other a little more, helping each other out a little more.  It's not specific to a state.  Christy used that in his speech last night.  He used the Superstorm Sandy a few times to be like, hey, I'm great.  Basically saying, if any other state had to deal with that superstorm, they would have just fucking, you know. 
[01:14:30]  Crazy.  They would have folded.  Throw sand at each other?  They would have done the same shit?  Of course they would have.  Throw their own feces and, uh...  Yeah.  It's just bullshit.  We're going to show you what New Jerseyans are made of!  The same mediocre nonsense as the other 49 states!  There was another one he said last night.  There was a heckler, but he was talking about hugs, and I guess a guy, I couldn't really hear it,  but I guess the guy asked for a hug, and he goes, you'll get one later or something? 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  And then he looks at the camera and goes, what is it, open bar tonight?  Yeah.  And he got a big laugh, and then he goes, that's New Jersey for ya!  That's New Jersey!  Because I guess only New Jerseyans like a good open bar.  Yeah.  And a stiff beverage.  We're wild in New Jersey!  Yeah, that's New Jersey!  Right!  Same as Pennsylvania, and let me list the other 48.  Actually, it might even be in this part of the speech, if he's talking about hugs.  Let's see if he says New Jerseyans are the same as Honoluluans.  Yes! 
[01:15:30]  Claws, claws, claws.  I'm resolved, I'm resolved to complete this mission.  Oh.  Not because of me.  It's two years of it.  But because of you.  Oh, shut up.  Last year I've had a lot of people.  Oh, here it is.  Ask me for hugs.  Uh-huh.  A lot of people.  A lot of people.  Big.  Big.  Oh.  You'll get your hug later, brother.  Okay, here it is.  About the open bar.  And, um, I can, I can tell you this. 
[01:16:00]  I guess there is open bar tonight, huh?  Fuck yeah.  People are seated.  Fuck yeah.  Welcome to New Jersey.  Ah, welcome to New Jersey.  No open bars in any of the other states.  Welcome to whatever state I happen to be standing in.  Basically saying that every other state, if there's an open bar, people drink responsibly.  Ah.  But not in Jersey.  Welcome to Jersey.  We work hard and party hard.  Make sure you drive home after drinking, too, people. 
[01:16:30]  That's right.  New Jerseyans like to drive drunk.  You bet they do.  So they can flip over like that fucking, the other governor from a couple years ago.  Oh, yeah.  Even though he wasn't driving.  Remember him?  Who was that?  Jim Corzai.  Doug Corzai.  Oh, did he get in Dutch with some money?  Wow.  Oh, boy.  They all do eventually.  No, not Christy.  He's on a mission, he says.  I don't know how awful like a fat person hug is, too.  Oh, God.  You don't know what to do. 
[01:17:00]  You can't reach all the way around.  A hug.  Yeah.  A hug works when you can get the arms together.  You're just kind of pushing him.  You can't get your arms around a hug so you can push.  But you want a big, fat, sweaty man hug from Governor Christy?  Oh, no.  Patting rolls.  Oh, God.  Anyway.  Yeah, let's hear a little more of Christy's.  Oh, man.  Vote it.  Go ahead.  He's killing with that line.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:17:30]  People love it.  People ask me for hugs to comfort them.  Oh.  People ask me for hugs to make sure I wouldn't forget them.  People ask me for hugs just to know that the leader of this state cared about them.  And people came up to me all the time in the aftermath and said to me, Governor, where did you get the energy?  Listen to me.  Where did you get the energy day after day after day to do that? 
[01:18:00]  Uh-huh.  And I told them, you don't understand, do you?  Oh.  Oh, Christ.  Yuck.  Those hugs gave more to me than I could ever give back to them.  Oh.  They gave me hope and faith and optimism for our future.  Oh, how dare she is that?  What a terrible acting job.  Don't you understand, you fucking asshole?  You don't get it, do you?  The people of New Jersey have given me much more than I could ever hope to give back to them. 
[01:18:30]  Wait, you got to hear that.  You got to hear the last part.  Well, why are we hiring you to do the job?  Why don't we just do it?  Wait, go back.  Go back.  They've given me the trust.  Where they were talking over, because it's...  And it's with that hope.  Yeah, right there.  There you go.  Listen to this.  The people of New Jersey have given me much more than I could ever hope to give back to  them.  Oh.  This is a lie.  They've given me hope, they've given me faith, and they've given me the trust. 
[01:19:00]  Oh.  And it's with that hope, with that optimism, that faith, and that trust that we together  confront the next four years of opportunity for our state, I know that tonight, a dispirited  America, angry with their dysfunctional government in Washington...  Oh, boy. 
[01:19:30]  Whoa, dysfunctional government in Washington.  What a heck.  Looks to New Jersey to say...  We do.  Is what I think happening really happening?  Are people really coming together?  No one says that.  You pause that.  I haven't said that once.  And you're a New Jerseyan, Jimmy.  I grew up in Jersey.  I'm one of the people you speak of.  I don't look at you as a bastion of sanity. 
[01:20:00]  Thank God for this oasis of love called New Jersey.  Shut up.  He had to get along with Obama.  He had no choice.  It was a no-choice situation.  He needed those federal dollars.  They didn't just get to get...  It had to be that way.  Who's standing around going, how do they do it in Jersey?  I can't figure out how the heck they did it.  They're all so loving.  How did black and white come together?  Jersey figured it out. 
[01:20:30]  No one says that.  No one.  No one.  How do they fucking live with that stench?  Yeah.  That's what people are saying.  How do they let Camden get out of hand?  That's what people are saying.  How come if I complain that I'm getting the line cut at Great Adventure, I could get stabbed?  Yeah.  He's deluded about people talking about New Jersey.  Yeah.  A little more.  Let's see what else he's saying.  Are we being too bitter?  No.  It's truthful.  Because I really just see it like this. 
[01:21:00]  It's a terribly...  Do they see between the lines with this horse shit?  No.  Yeah.  I don't know a lot of them.  I think people hate the government, too.  I think they, you know...  Right.  He got more out of the hugs?  It's a terribly phony speech.  He got more out of the hugs?  Really?  He got more out of the hugs.  It really is a saccharine drip.  How do you do it?  What are you talking about?  Does he grind on their legs?  Yeah.  Exactly.  With his fupa pussy.  What you felt was not spilled water.  No.  Here comes the pre. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  It was my pre-cum soaking through my trouser-like pants.  Whatever.  You got the job done after a big storm because, you know, it's Jersey and not New Orleans.  Period.  Yeah.  There's a lot more to lose if you let, you know, that whole area go down.  Oh, man.  And that's why he got his federal dollars, and that's why Obama swept in.  Obama didn't have a choice, and Chrissy didn't have a choice.  Have they worked together since?  Um, eh. 
[01:22:00]  I'm not really visually.  Obama did call to say, how do New Jerseyans do it?  Yeah.  Let's keep going.  All New Jerseyans.  Yeah.  We, you know, we love Jersey, got a lot of fans in Jersey, whatever, but they're just  as cool as the people on Long Island, and Philly, and Boston.  Obama needed that boost, too, when he was helping out Christie.  It kind of made him look like a good guy, like he's, you know, working with everybody,  blah-dee-blah-dee-blah.  Yeah.  All right. 
[01:22:30]  Let's get to the end of this amazing speech.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Suburbanites, and city dwellers, farmers, and teachers.  I love when they give me examples.  Are we really all working together?  Let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight.  No.  Under this government, our first job is to get the job done, and as long as I'm governor,  that job will always, always be finished.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who goes to these things? 
[01:23:00]  Oh, claps.  Stands there.  I think tonight, most particularly, and I know my dad and my brother and sister who are  here tonight with me share this same view.  I think tonight, most particularly, about my mother.  Uh-oh.  All of you who have heard me over the last four years know that she was and still is 
[01:23:30]  the dominant influence in my life.  Mama's boy?  A boy.  As I said on the video.  Mother.  Blood.  Explains the fatness.  As I said on the video.  Yeah.  My mom used to say to me all the time, Christopher, be yourself.  Put that away.  You're in public.  Tomorrow, you don't have to worry about trying to remember who you pretended to be yesterday.  Huh?  Whoa.  Powerful words from a woman who I miss every day. 
[01:24:00]  But tonight, tonight, I know.  Uh-oh, here it is.  That my mom is looking down on New Jersey.  Oh, from heaven.  Looking down on Jersey?  And saying to me, I can feel it.  If you died and you could be anywhere?  She's saying to me, Chris, the job's not done yet.  Get back to work and finish the job for the people of New Jersey.  That's exactly what I want to do.  I love you, New Jersey.  Thank you very much.  Is that what his mom...  I think after you die, and if there is an afterlife, I don't think you see states anymore. 
[01:24:30]  I don't think you're up there looking down.  I think you see it very differently.  On Jersey, saying, hey, get to work.  Because you think it's dead mom.  Because if there is an afterlife, I assume they give you the secrets of the universe,  and then you start really laughing at how ridiculous it is down there on Earth.  Wouldn't you just be zipping to the other side of the cosmos somewhere?  Like, okay, you've passed on to a wonderful new existence. 
[01:25:00]  You can do all these amazing things.  What do you want to do?  I'm just going to hover over Jersey for a while.  Just going to kind of just stay in place.  Because I missed the old stench.  Yeah.  I want to make sure I get a message to my son that, you know, hey, you're back to work.  But then again, when we talk about our dead dads, the lights did flicker in here.  Yeah.  Sam is our witness.  They did.  Yeah.  Well, do it again, then.  Don't push it.  Say nothing. 
[01:25:30]  What are you going to do?  That was a rousing little Jersey speech.  So that's the Gov.  There are other things in there that's worth playing, but...  I just love when these idiots try to say their state is special and more important than any other state in America.  Very important.  No.  People are people.  Human nature is what it is.  People come to the table during...  Hard times.  Hard times.  Because you have to.  It's part of a...  You don't have a choice. 
[01:26:00]  Revival instincts that people have built in them.  Right.  You know?  The government...  The people in government love to make you believe that they are the ones that will help  you and get you out of trouble.  And a lot of times you're left on your own.  Mm-hmm.  Well, after the break, we'll talk about the Toronto mayor.  Oh, the Toronto mayor.  I understand.  Now that he explained it, I get it.  Yeah, now it makes perfect sense.  Yeah, totally.  That don't make no sense.  I get it now.  Sorry, Tim. 
[01:26:30]  We got Julius Erving coming in today.  The doctor.  Dr. J.  Aw.  You still love Dr. J.  Yeah.  Yeah, I gotta go to take it to the hoop.  Yeah, I gotta take it to the hoop and try to slam it down.  Daryl Dawkins used to pull the backboards down.  I couldn't do that because my mustache would get caught in the rim.  Yeah, I was trying to dunk over Kareem and he knocked me down.  Aw.  Aw.  The doctor's in the house. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah, I leap through the air.  I'm very graceful.  Dr. J.  Yeah, Dr. J.  It stands for jerk-off, jackass.  Good for him.  He'll be in later.  Yeah, doctor.  I don't know much about basketball.  He's a legend.  I don't know much about him.  Huh?  What?  Just New York voters approved seven Las Vegas-style casinos?  Oh, yeah.  That passed last night.  That's not good.  Why? 
[01:27:30]  That's not good for society.  I think it's great.  Why?  Here's what they're saying.  Tax it.  Here's what they're saying.  Yeah, but people are irresponsible and they spend their entire paychecks in these places.  But here's what they're saying.  They allow them to have booze, let them gamble.  Here's what they're saying.  What are they saying?  They're saying that-  I hate these casinos that pop up.  They're allowing this in some of the more, let's say, impoverished areas of upstate New York.  Okay, so those people are going to be even poorer.  Because everyone knows you can't win at gambling.  No, they're thinking- 
[01:28:00]  The majority of people lose their shit.  But they're thinking most people will get good jobs at these casinos, then will spend  all their money in the casinos.  Also, the people that are gamblers are going to Foxwoods anyway.  They're going to Atlantic City anyway.  And Connecticut and Jersey are getting all the gambling tax money.  They're still gambling.  And even there, you could go to upstate New York.  You could go to places like Niagara Falls.  Pennsylvania even?  Yeah, Pennsylvania. 
[01:28:30]  I've been in a couple of the shitty casinos in the Pennsylvania area.  It's not good for society.  All I'm saying is when these politicians say no one left behind, this type of behavior  leaves people behind because it leads them to poverty.  In any good simulation game, SimCity type of game, there's always the option to put casinos  in.  And all of a sudden, your revenue just goes through the roof.  But you have to put more police around it. 
[01:29:00]  And then there's more like homeless.  And look at Atlantic City.  It's amazing how the simulations work.  As soon as you get off the strip, it's amazing.  It's an amazing shithole.  Oh, yeah.  They don't even put money back into the area, meaning a couple blocks away from the casinos.  I've always been against this shit.  Oh, never mind.  Tax it.  Yeah, but then what do they do with the tax money?  It's supposed to go to education.  Well, it's supposed to.  But I don't see education getting way better because these casinos pop up.  As long as you don't fuck with the skim, though.  But it goes against everything. 
[01:29:30]  Like the whole leaving people behind.  They know this is, in general, bad for people.  Yeah, yeah.  They know.  Where are the casinos going to be this summer?  People have spoken.  They just voted that.  Kaskill?  Yeah, kind of upstate.  The southern tier?  Oh, boy.  Isn't that like Rochester, Buffalo area?  Um, I don't know.  What's the southern tier?  Look it up.  Isn't that what they call the southern tier?  Oh, that's like that.  The southern part of the straight line of New York. 
[01:30:00]  They're over Pennsylvania, right?  Yeah, that's like Elmira, Binghamton.  Oh, way down there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How about Manhattan?  Put a casino.  I don't think you'll ever see that.  Why not?  Christ, you don't want that.  I'm telling you.  I would love that.  Get the tax money, man.  They should, uh, let the tax money go.  People make their own choices.  There's a free society.  They want a drink?  I think they let them drink.  I mean, they either take booze out.  They want to gamble, let them gamble.  But don't make believe we're trying to, you know, bring everyone up.  Look what happened when Biff built his casino in, um, Hill Valley. 
[01:30:30]  Went to shit, right?  Could just take everything, uh, from Back to the Future.  What do I know?  Yeah.  Wow.  We do have to take a break, but this headline, HIV-positive Florida man douses girlfriend  with gasoline and forces her to have unprotected sex.  Like, where did it go wrong?  Wow.  Because I'd like to think every relationship starts, like, all nice and lovey-dovey and  you can't get enough of each other.  And then you fast forward and this shit's happening.  Why douse her with gasoline? 
[01:31:00]  How do you keep a rod with gas on you?  Right?  You know you're giving someone AIDS and you have gas on you and you still can fuck.  That guy should just be killed.  Wow.  All right, well, let's talk about the, uh, the mayor of Toronto next and some other things.  But yeah, Dr. J's coming in at nine and our pal Jason Statham will be here at 930 promoting  his latest movie.  He better be here at 930.  And, uh, tomorrow?  Yeah.  Bill Burr.  Ah!  Nice.  They're getting very famous, Bill Burr.  Oh, yes. 
[01:31:30]  He's on a rocket ship now.  Well, I'll tell you.  Couldn't be happier for the guy.  I saw him in a movie last night that was recommended to me.  So did I!  Sam Roberts.  You want to talk about the movie next?  Yeah.  You saw Heat, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Like this?  Uh, toward this, right?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  But I have a theory, too, about...  Oh, really?  ...as to why he had his opinion.  Yeah.  But before we get into this, and I swear to you, Bill Burr was amazing in the movie. 
[01:32:00]  I know!  Okay.  Hilarious.  Absolutely.  Yeah, yeah.  I was kind of wishing for more Bill Burr.  I know.  I know.  When he goes off, right when they first come in the house, and he's going off at the table  about how she should arrest people in the house.  He nailed it.  He was fucking great.  He nailed it.  Yeah.  I was wishing for more Bill Burr.  Yes.  That says a little bit about this movie there, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  Of course you want your friend to be in it more.  Ah, yeah.  We recognize talent.  Yeah.  You have a talented friend. 
[01:32:30]  Is he our friend still?  I hope so.  Hope so.  We'll find out tomorrow.  Very funny.  We love the Burr.  All right.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We're rocking. 
[01:33:00]  Is Anthony making duties?  I hope so.  Yeah.  I hope he's shit all over the back of his legs and off his ankles.  Hopefully he's making.  I like the white stripes.  I like them a lot.  This isn't them.  Jack White.  It's him.  No, I know it's Jack White, but to me everything is like White Stripes-ish.  The Rack and Tord. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  I don't like them.  I wish I did.  You don't like Jack White?  To me everything is like White Stripes.  There's too much going on in this to be the White Stripes.  Yeah.  Nah.  The White Stripes were two people, but he was the brains behind the operation, so it doesn't  matter what he calls his band, it's still like the same sound, more or less.  Close enough, right?  Because he's got such a unique singing style.  That's right.  That's what it is.  He's very good, buddy.  He's wacky here.  I'm just getting Doc Brown hair from Back to the Future.  That's a good head of hair. 
[01:34:00]  It's crazy.  You think he did a little action up there?  Nah.  He's always had a great big head of hair.  Well, my theory is, you know, the rest of his body is rotting, so it's like fertilizer  for his hair.  Yeah, maybe it's feeding off of his body.  Amazing set of hair.  It's going to look good in a coffin.  Wild gray hair on that scent and pillow.  But we love him.  Of course.  Love the eye, man.  Toronto Mayor.  We got him?  Oh, Heat.  Thank you.  Okay, yeah.  Ah, that's it. 
[01:34:30]  So Sam said, I had no desire to see Heat.  I didn't either.  Although I wanted to see it because...  The Heat.  Not Heat.  Not Heat.  Sorry.  The De Niro movie.  The Heat.  But, you know, in the movie, they finally brought the Heat.  Right.  Now I understand the title.  Okay, good.  It took Sandra Bullock a while to see it Melissa McCarthy's way.  Right.  But as soon as she saw Melissa McCarthy's way, well, then she was all in and she brought  the Heat.  Thus then, the title of the movie.  Right.  I wanted to see the movie because of Bill Burr.  Because of our power.  Yeah. 
[01:35:00]  I heard Billy was in it and I'm like, yeah, I got to see that.  And we had Blu-rays laying around.  Sam goes, you know, it really is a funny movie.  I go, ooh, okay.  Sam liked it a lot.  All right.  Now I got to see this movie.  So I watched it last night.  The first observation, it's a fucking long movie.  Oh, my God.  That's one of those movies that should not be...  How many minutes was it?  And if you tell me it's only 90 minutes, then there's a problem.  Yeah.  It seemed long.  It had to be over two hours.  It seemed very long.  Maybe you watched the director's cut version or something. 
[01:35:30]  I don't think so.  The director's cut.  I watched it on demand.  What did you think of the movie?  You know, I get Melissa McCarthy.  She's a very funny lady.  She's over the top.  Certainly, she's playing over the top in this movie.  But like 20% less of her over the top would be good for everybody.  Maybe.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right?  Just pour it on a little much.  A little too much.  Her wacky character thing.  Sandra Bullock, her face at this point doesn't move. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah, it was a little difficult.  Extremely plastic looking.  I don't know.  The jokes.  The fucking ass.  It's an hour 57, by the way.  Okay.  Yeah, that's too long.  It's too long.  You need 90 minutes.  A few of the jokes were all right.  I thought it was funny.  I left my balls off.  A few jokes were okay.  Now, here's why you left your balls off.  And I have a theory.  Because I was watching and thinking, all right.  You watched it with your chick, right?  No.  Oh, jeez.  That's my whole theory.  That's it.  I watched it with my chick.  And she likes a good commie. 
[01:36:30]  And she got up a few times to do other shit.  Oh, boy.  Yep.  But I didn't want to miss Bill Burr.  Well, then you're just unfunny.  I'm telling you, if Bill Burr wasn't in the movie, I would have turned it off.  Yeah.  And then when he popped on the screen, he was really good.  Yeah, but you also came in and said Bridesmaids was shitty when you saw it.  Yeah, but I changed my opinion on that.  Exactly.  You won't on this, though.  I was distracted in a hotel room when we were seeing Bridesmaids the first time.  And then I saw it without any distractions and realized, yeah, that's a pretty funny fucking movie. 
[01:37:00]  Were your kids in the room with you?  When?  Oh, God, yeah.  All right, sounds like a distraction to me.  Dude, the first fucking problem.  All right.  My kid is next to me with the iPad, and then he's taking peeks.  I'm like, you can't take peeks.  This is like an adult movie.  Oh.  And then there's some pretty graphic violence in this movie.  Oh, yeah.  So he saw his first, you know, he got a little taste of some graphic violence yesterday.  Graphic violence? 
[01:37:30]  Nice.  And then I'm trying to explain, ah, it's just silly stuff.  Ah, they're play acting.  Yeah, when the guy got shot right in the middle of the head.  Ah, that's just silly.  Don't worry about that.  Don't worry about that.  The explosion got to him, and he turned to me and goes, Daddy, that scared me.  I'm like, well, it's cartoons.  Oh, it's cartoons.  Don't worry about it.  It's cartoons.  But in his little mind, he's like, oh, okay, it's cartoons.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, that'll hold him for a little while.  You didn't laugh when Melissa McCarthy...  Even after the movie, I go, wow, we got to, all right, something went down here today 
[01:38:00]  in our house.  We got to make sure we don't have him just watching these movies with us.  Jesus.  You didn't laugh when she thought Sandra Bullock's pajamas were a pantsuit?  Which, it's funny.  Well, it was a tux, right?  And then she goes, sorry, I don't sleep.  I didn't know you slept in a tuxedo.  That's funny.  It's like two-piece pajamas.  It was all right.  It's like totally uncultured.  And then you had the lieutenant or captain or sergeant, whatever the fuck, going, in  my office.  There was that scene. 
[01:38:30]  In my office.  It was Biff.  Biff Tannen.  I know.  It was Biff.  But then, and then at the end, like, right out of 48 hours, she comes in and talks about  how, what a great partner she would be, and what a great cop she is.  She's a better cop than any of you guys.  It was one cop buddy movie cliche after another.  And then...  Chicks.  Nah, that's right.  Was it supposed to be cliches, though?  No, that's just it.  I didn't know.  It was played much too seriously. 
[01:39:00]  And did you see how Melissa McCarthy delivered a few lines, like, it was obvious that they  should have done another take?  She's not very good.  There was, like, a pause going with her acting or something.  She's kind of funny looking and funny and stuff, but she's not, like, a good actress.  The scene that got me where I was not all in anymore was when they had the bar scene  where they were doing the...  Oh, God.  You know what I'm talking about?  Yes, that was so doozy.  And they're finally bonding.  The bonding montage. 
[01:39:30]  The bonding montage was so uncomfortable.  Oh, they're dancing.  They're doing shots.  Right.  They've got tape on their face, making wacky faces.  Right.  And they're in a bar with, like, just two old guys.  Slow dancing with old guys.  Fucking hilarious.  Chip likes it.  But it was just so...  Chip, you'd love this movie.  It was so forced.  Yes, it was forced.  It was really uncomfortable.  Everything was very forced.  It didn't work.  It didn't work.  It didn't work.  It didn't work, that part.  Maybe that one part.  I mean, that wasn't my favorite part.  Oh.  That movie's fucking hilarious.  No, it's not. 
[01:40:00]  Jokes are funny.  Not really.  So what was your theory again?  See, my theory was he watched it with a chick.  Oh, okay.  And I can see if you're watching it with a girl, the girls might laugh at certain things,  and then you're like, oh, that's funny.  What's the dude that does...  Paul Feig.  Yeah, he does, like, chick comedies.  Well, he did Bridesmaids.  Yeah, he's known for doing some chick comedies.  And he's creative freaks and geeks.  And he was in the film Heavyweights.  Not only did I not watch it with Jess, but Jess was at work, and I called her because  I was laughing at that fucking tuxedo pajama joke. 
[01:40:30]  Jesus.  You laughed at that one?  I cracked up.  I called Jess to say, I'm laughing out loud alone in the house because of that joke.  Did she, like, hang up and find a man?  No.  Find a real man?  A real man.  Why?  Because...  Well, the movie...  You come over to my apartment, I'll show you a real man.  It wasn't a chick flick.  Just because it's women in the movie doesn't mean it's...  No, it wasn't a chick flick.  That's fair.  You're giggling over a fashion joke on a fucking...  It's not a fashion joke.  She called the pajamas a tuxedo. 
[01:41:00]  Shut up, pink shirt.  That's crazy.  It's a fashion joke.  It's a fashion joke.  The movie.  Fashion.  Pajamas.  Tuxedo.  Ah, she used the wrong salad fork.  Ah, that was hilarious.  Remember that thing?  She used the inside fork for the outside.  Hey!  That wasn't on that level.  I'm not a fan of movies where the two people need each other.  It's like, oh, God.  See, I'm not a fan of that.  You don't like when there's a little heart at the end.  No, I don't...  I actually, you know, don't misrepresent me.  I don't mind a little of that. 
[01:41:30]  I don't like the...  They need each other because it's been done a million fucking times.  It's nice.  I like how they worked the whole Melissa McCarthy thing, too.  They're like, she's out on the street.  She's being tough, you know, and she looks it.  But then when you needed to feel sympathy for her, like in the hospital, they fucking  pull her hair back and they put different makeup on to soften her look more so she'd  be more sympathetic.  And then when she's out on the street, she's got a little smudge on her cheek, her eyebrows  a little more mean. 
[01:42:00]  Right.  And then, oh, wait, it's the end.  We gotta make her all night.  Show business.  Well, what I liked about the movie, though, is they kind of learned from each other by  the end of the film.  I did like that there was a little lesson there.  Sandra Bullock was a little too stiff and Melissa McCarthy was a little too wild.  A little too abrasive.  And we learned that maybe somewhere in the middle would be good for both of them.  Melissa McCarthy learned not to marry a guy who does tattoos and Sandra Bullock learned  don't eat like a fatso.  They both learned a life lesson.  I don't think it's a horrible movie, Sam Roberts. 
[01:42:30]  It's a funny movie.  It's not horrible.  It's average.  Plus, then in the end, I was laughing when my favorite Bill Burr joke was at the end,  spoiler alert, when she's on stage accepting her certificate and all that stuff.  And then Bill Burr, with his boss next, and is yelling, take out your gun!  Yeah, yeah.  That was funny.  I'm telling you, he was really good in the movie.  He was really good.  And then when he was yelling, hold it up!  Hold it up!  It's just simple shit, but how he does it, it's hilarious.  It's like a psychopath when his leg is fucking shaking, and he's got the baseball bat in 
[01:43:00]  his hand.  Let's say hi to Amanda in Canada.  Our first phone call of the day is not happening because these fucking phones are broken again.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Tim, how about you fix the phones?  How about we start there?  Oh, shit.  Every day, there's...  I'm breaking the screen, Tim.  No, no, oh, no.  Why?  I don't think the screen has anything to do with it.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Here comes E-Rock.  E-Rock has to trudge in every fucking day.  You're a heavy walker. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, man.  Isn't he?  Yeah, he lumbered.  He duff lumber.  How about you start there?  Fix our fucking phones.  It'll be better in the afternoon.  Hug Opie.  Get more out of his hug than you would giving a hug.  There's bugs in the phone system.  You come in here on a regular basis.  And it worked this morning, yeah.  It always starts off working, but then something happens.  Thank you.  Ah.  Did you hug him?  Yep.  Good.  Let's go hug a fucking A-Train.  He's hugging Jimmy. 
[01:44:00]  I'm kind of mad at myself.  What happened?  I don't know.  I've got to get more angry.  That should have broke.  No, those screens are very hard to break.  The people at home didn't see that.  That should have absolutely broke.  You couldn't have bounced off the glass.  It bounced off, like, fucking sadly.  These monitors are very hard to break.  That should have gone.  They're not really, like, glassy.  They're not hard to break.  I know.  Well, they're...  I feel like testosterone.  Well, I'm getting in trouble for saying this, but I was absolutely going for a moment there  and breaking the fucking screen, and it didn't happen.  So now I look like an idiot.  Amanda, what's up?  Hi. 
[01:44:30]  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  I was just going to call because I heard you talking about heat, and...  But what do you know?  All you guys in Canada smoke crack.  Oh, yeah.  We're all good.  Are you near Toronto?  Because we're sending it to Toronto.  Yeah, we are near Toronto.  All right.  What do you got on the heat?  I was listening to the show yesterday, and I heard Sam going on about what an awesome, 
[01:45:00]  hilarious movie it was, and I immediately wanted to call.  And then, especially when I heard you talk about it today, how it may have been the girl's  point of view.  Yeah.  The first thing I thought yesterday when Sam said it was an awesome movie was how disappointed  you guys were going to be because it was fucking horrible.  See?  She's Canadian.  I've got to be fair.  I didn't think it was horrible.  Yeah.  But it was...  I was hoping for more.  I felt like I had wasted my time that could have better been spent watching a different 
[01:45:30]  movie.  Or Three Stooges, which everybody said was kind of funny.  Yeah.  Kind of.  Fucking DVR Little People Big World for this movie.  Oh, man.  The fucking roll-offs are back together for the first time in a few years on their little  fucking midget farm.  Where they both go out and try to find tall people and flop, and they came back into a  little shoebox.  I've got to know what happened on Little People Big World.  I'll tell you what happened.  I get laughed at.  Me too.  They just gross people out with those fingers. 
[01:46:00]  Amanda has a...  Amanda.  Vienna sausages sticking out of a muffin.  That's what their hands look like.  Little muffin palms.  And then the Vienna sausage fingers.  Little midget's hands.  Imagine a midget making a sandwich for you.  Who would eat that fucking hunk of shit?  No, you'd probably bite his delicious fingers.  Yes.  I'll have a Vienna muffin.  Get over here.  Tastes like cheese bread.  Oh, God. 
[01:46:30]  Amanda, as a...  You know...  As a chick.  Yeah.  Did you like the movie?  Not with...  I was horrible.  Yeah.  I was expecting a lot more out of it because of Sam Roberts' endorsement.  I don't think Melissa McCarthy was horrible.  I think they're still trying to find a vehicle for her, as they call it.  I mean, he was.  That was supposed to be a vehicle for her.  It was a vehicle for her.  But it didn't work. 
[01:47:00]  How not?  It made $160 million.  Yeah, it should have made at least two.  What are you talking about?  It was a huge hit.  No, not really.  Not with the intellects.  Like who?  You and Ant?  That's right.  Oh.  That's right.  We expect a little more from our comedies.  Yeah, they get it.  The Heat made $230 million worldwide.  It was a Melissa McCarthy vehicle.  That's a hit.  A huge hit.  Huge hit.  That's a big hit right there.  I'll say.  If I saw it in a movie theater, I would have not been disappointed.  Yeah?  I never would have thought to have seen it in a movie. 
[01:47:30]  But it's an endorsement.  You're going to pay $13 and you're not going to be disappointed?  I don't know.  Then you could have added $13 to that total right there.  That would have been great.  If you had my $13, I meant to.  So now how much do they make?  Now I made $100.  I would have brought somebody, too.  Oh, wow.  I got it on demand.  So you could have that.  Yep.  So that's what?  On there.  $6?  It was like $6, yeah.  Plus your $26.  That's $32.  Yeah, and now what's the...  Worldwide?  Yep.  What's the total now? 
[01:48:00]  $229,334,924.  Whatever.  That's huge.  Wow.  Bill Burr was in a blockbuster.  Yeah.  Good for him.  I wish I could get movies first run at my house.  I'd pay like fucking $50.  I don't know why they're waiting.  I'd pay like $50.  Wouldn't you pay $100?  I'd pay $100.  You'd pay $100 to watch a movie at your house?  Yeah.  I'd have people come over.  Yeah, but that's what other people would do, too. 
[01:48:30]  They would just like divvy it up.  I'd charge them.  People don't have $100 to be spending on a pay-per-view movie.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, we do.  But there's enough people that would do it.  Yeah, we do.  The three of you is...  I would pay $50.  Not $100.  I'd pay $50, and I wouldn't be doing it like all the time.  It's only if I want to, you know...  Right.  But why aren't they doing it?  They'd be like, I don't know.  They don't want it out there.  They haven't figured out the numbers yet, right?  Yeah, they don't want it out there.  I do like that it's getting closer and closer, though, because there are movies on demand  and early release and stuff like that now. 
[01:49:00]  Well, they do it in theaters now, but it's always those artsy films that they know people  aren't going to watch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's still in theaters.  But every once in a while, you get a still in theaters.  That is a pretty good movie.  They're actually going to...  There's something called a Glendar screen.  A Glendar screen.  What is that?  It's a new technology where they're going to have all the first-run movies on.  Yeah?  I don't believe you.  I'm just getting close that time.  You look silly.  Playing Glendar.  Let's say hi to Lenny in Toronto.  Lenny, what's up?  You trying to tend the rabbits, are you? 
[01:49:30]  Nice.  Just killed Curly's wife.  Yes.  Lenny!  How's it going?  That's great, man.  Moving to afternoons.  It's going to be great.  Yep.  Going to be able to sleep in for once.  Yep.  What do you got?  Well, I figured, you know, I'm your number one Toronto fan.  You'd want to go directly to me to ask any questions you had about our mayor.  Well, I totally get the mayor now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  Talk to you.  Mayor Crack Smoker. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Who is he, Marion Barry?  Well, that was the first mayor...  We had Mayor Crack Smoker.  Thumbs up, Chip.  Right.  Funny.  So, let's listen to the mayor finally admitting that he smoked crack.  We said this would happen.  Well, this was an obvious one, though.  I take pride in the ones that aren't so obvious that come through.  That's right.  We're true.  We predicted Sally Field would be in a Bukkake movie.  Yep.  It's a surface.  It's a waiting.  Yeah. 
[01:50:30]  So, this fool got caught smoking crack on video, and they finally found the fucking videotape,  and that's why he's coming forward going up.  Yeah.  He even said...  All right.  It's time to talk about it.  A while ago, he said, there's no videotape or anything of me smoking crack.  And then, uh-oh, there is a videotape.  That's why I can't believe anything these people say.  No.  It's all lies.  Yeah.  On the video that I haven't seen, you guys have asked me a question.  Right.  How...  Did you say it was a discreet that we just brought in the video on Thursday? 
[01:51:00]  It was very cautious.  You asked me a question back in May, and you can repeat that question.  The question we asked him back in May?  Yeah.  Can you explain it?  You said the video didn't get into it.  You asked me a couple of questions.  He's going for the dramatic moment.  He's going for a moment.  Because he wants him to ask, well, did you smoke crack?  And now he's going to go, yes.  I did.  Just fucking say it.  I know.  Your moment's not working, so say it.  Ask me the same question.  It rhymes with lack?  It rhymes with, did you broke lack? 
[01:51:30]  What's his name again?  Fat Piggy Man.  He really is Fat Piggy Man.  Rob Ford.  Rob Ford.  Right.  Okay.  You asked me a couple of questions.  And what were those questions?  Do you smoke crack cocaine?  Exactly.  Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine.  Oh.  But no, do I?  Am I an addict?  No.  Have I tried it?  Probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago. 
[01:52:00]  I answered your question.  You ask the question properly, I'll answer it.  The lies continue.  There's no way you're just doing crack cocaine once.  Yeah, you just do it once.  Yeah, I got so drunk, I smoked crack cocaine.  I got so hammered.  You know how it is when you zooted.  And I smoked some crack.  And that was it.  They got him for the one time, so he's going to admit the one time and say it was only the one time.  There is no one on earth that has smoked crack once.  Unless you die while you're smoking.  Right, right, right. 
[01:52:30]  Unless you have a horrendous experience.  No one.  You're smoking it again.  He's the same thing as Anthony Weiner, except instead of sexting, he smokes crack.  It's the crack.  The crack.  But, I mean, his explanation is completely acceptable.  Yes.  He was drunk.  You don't really drink, Sam, so you don't get it.  You can drink enough where all of a sudden you've got to go grab the crack pipe.  Grab the crack pipe.  Yep.  Okay.  Yes, I've made mistakes.  All I can do now is apologize and move on. 
[01:53:00]  I don't know what else.  What about the lies?  All I can say is I've made mistakes.  And you guys kept referring to alcohol.  There was a couple isolated incidents.  There's been times when I've been in a drunken stupor.  That's why I want to see the tape.  I want everyone in the city to see this tape.  No, you don't.  I'd like to see this tape.  I don't even recall there being a tape or a video, and I know that.  So I want to see the state that I was in.  Uh-oh.  But that's exactly it.  I don't know what else I can say here. 
[01:53:30]  So I wasn't lying.  You didn't ask the correct questions.  No, I'm not an addict.  And no, I do not do drugs.  I've made mistakes in the past, and all I can do is apologize.  But it is what it is.  Pause.  And he's admitting mistakes.  That means he's done drugs more than once.  I don't do drugs.  I've done drugs.  Oh, you asked the wrong questions.  What a semantics hunk of shit.  This is why they're all so hateable.  Yeah.  Every one of them.  They can't even tell the truth when they're caught on video. 
[01:54:00]  He got nailed, and he's still trying to backpedal.  Well, because, you know, being the mayor is a kick-ass job.  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to lose that.  And he's not going to step down.  No.  I hope not.  That's going to be amazing.  And he's not going to stop smoking crack.  No.  Hell, would he?  Ha-na.  Ha-na.  He's going to come forward.  I told you I smoked crack.  I mean, yeah.  I can't change the past. 
[01:54:30]  I'd like to take this opportunity to address a number of issues that have circulated in the media over the last few days.  There has been a serious accusation from the Toronto Star that I use crack cocaine.  I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict of crack cocaine.  Oh, boy.  As for a video, I cannot comment on a video that I have never seen or does not exist.  Wow.  So they put those two together.  Yeah.  Because he's saying you asked the wrong question. 
[01:55:00]  Right.  He did crack cocaine, but he doesn't do crack cocaine.  Oh, that's it.  That's the difference.  What a fat liar.  He got him there.  What a fat semantics liar.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let me say, wow, Canada is very excited.  That we need him today.  James, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Actually, the audio you guys were listening to was from a media scrum.  He actually did a formal statement later on at a press conference. 
[01:55:30]  And at the end, he finished, after going on and on about all this bullshit,  he ended with, God bless Toronto, to which there was audible laughter in the room.  The media was actually laughing at him.  Wait a minute.  God can't bless Toronto because God blesses America.  What the fuck is that?  Yeah.  Impossible.  We got the God thing in our country.  Right.  Your city can't have God bless. 
[01:56:00]  Sorry.  We have it.  If God was going to bless Toronto, he wouldn't give them a fat, drug addict mayor.  Right.  Right.  I'm not a drug addict.  A fat, crack-smoking, alcoholic mayor.  Right.  God had his chance and he fucked up.  God stuck it right in Toronto's ass.  Yeah.  That's right.  Without lube.  Yeah.  No lube.  Here's your fat, lying, crack-smoking, drunk mayor.  I didn't realize until today that other places use the God bless, and then their city or country, you know, there. 
[01:56:30]  Mm-hmm.  I thought it was just God bless America.  I thought, too.  We're very close-minded here.  What?  The thing is that we don't ever use it.  It's an American thing.  Canadians would never say that.  Oh, is that why they laughed at him?  Oh, okay.  The fact that he pulled that out of his bag of shit is just ridiculous.  Oh, all right.  I learned something.  So you guys don't really use that.  Huh.  Godless nation up there.  My fat mayor wife smokes crack for us.  I just saw him.  Yeah.  Fat Asian wife, Susan, smokes crack. 
[01:57:00]  Rob Ford looks like a goofball.  He is wacky.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Derek in Cananana.  Derek in Cananana.  All right.  It goes da-na-na-na-na-na.  Not da-na-na-na-na-na-na.  You like that, right?  Is that what the mayor is doing?  That's what the mayor is doing.  Yeah.  Oh, you know, that's a great way to put it.  Yeah, yeah.  The mayor is saying he didn't go dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  He went dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun. 
[01:57:30]  How do you remember that?  Oh, it's fucking ingrained.  Because that's exactly how he said it.  Oh, yeah.  It's ingrained in my head now, that extra note.  It was just the extra note.  Yeah.  So that's the did-do thing.  Yeah.  With your lovely mayor.  Right.  God, does any city have a normal mayor?  No.  Let's run down the list.  Do we have any statements from the Detroit mayor?  I'd like to hear his speech.  It's like, can we all just settle down?  Oh, boy.  No, he's the new guy. 
[01:58:00]  That's not Dave Bing.  Oh, man.  The new mayor.  He's some Irish guy, I think, right?  I think it's some Irish dude in there to fucking-  I think it's an acceptance speech.  He said, let's all boo.  Yeah, yeah.  Mike Dugan.  Hi, Mike.  I'm Mike Dugan.  Yeah, Kenny Johnson.  Hold on.  Before we move-  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  There's one other thing about Rob Ford.  I knew there was another thing, and I'm glad the listener is helping out here.  Eric in Boston.  No, this went down yesterday, too. 
[01:58:30]  We should discuss it for a minute.  Go ahead, Eric.  Hey, I just wanted to comment that Jenny Johnson, not Kenny, because your call screener's an idiot.  Okay.  Jenny Johnson High Five, who is barely Twitter famous, made a comment that the mayor of Toronto  was racist during his press conference because he was wearing a red-skinned tie.  Oh.  Yeah, they're trying to fucking nail him to that, too.  Because he's wearing a red-skinned-  Oh, God.  Yeah, isn't that amazing?  That's silly.  This guy wants to defend the mayor. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, my God.  All right.  He's playing his dealer.  Yeah.  Chris.  Yes, Marion from D.C.  What's up, Chris?  I don't think he's lying, because judging by his size, he obviously has his addiction  under control.  Well, maybe, or maybe he's supposed to be even fatter.  Right.  He's supposed to be giant fatter.  Maybe he's supposed to be the heaviest man in the world.  Or he offsets it with alcohol bloat.  Yeah.  Right.  Pizzas.  I can't correct him.  Brony pizzas.  All right, buddy.  Swallowed a lot of aggression as a child. 
[01:59:30]  Along with a lot of pizzas.  Mwah, mwah, mwah.  Cracking pizzas.  Wasn't George W. Bush a cokehead, people are asking.  He was sober before he got in office.  At some juncture.  He wasn't smoking crack while he was in office.  Let me explain.  He did coke.  He didn't do coke.  Right.  Right.  I like the fact dumb Sam didn't know exactly what position he had.  So Sam tried to say it.  He goes, but he was in office.  I knew he was the president.  In office.  Before that.  You didn't know what he did, did you?  He was the governor.  I bet you can't name five presidents. 
[02:00:00]  You bet I can't name five?  I just had a conversation with Oliver Stone about five presidents yesterday.  Wow.  So what?  Big whoop.  You probably just said five presidents.  You didn't say their names?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You probably said four twice.  Yeah, because you did the Oliver Stone interview yesterday, we're in trouble.  That's not why you're in trouble.  That's exactly why.  I think it is.  You should have closed the curtains and made believe that we were closed for the day.  You would have also been in trouble if you had just had him go about his business. 
[02:00:30]  If he had showed up and there had just been a sign on the door that said, nobody's home?  No one here.  Gone fishing?  Yeah.  That's a good one.  On vacation.  Yeah.  Quarantine.  Back in five.  Yeah.  That's a good one, too.  So, uh, oh, you wanted the speech from the Detroit man?  Oh, yeah.  I want to hear a little of his acceptance speech.  So the first white guy in 40 years in Detroit.  Yeah.  His voice was hoarse, so I bet you he won't speak much more than 10 minutes tonight.  And here he is. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, boy.  He's surrounded.  Well, the good news is my voice won't hold up for a long speech.  You don't even have shitty microphones in Detroit.  Oh, he's got his hands full.  It's about time you did the right thing.  He's doing a speech from a giant black pot on a fire.  It's been an amazing year.  And we ran. 
[02:01:30]  Mayor Buona.  He was a very strong opponent who gave us a tough race.  Brought it very close at the end.  And it's a good time right now to salute Sheriff Napoleon for his lifetime.  Oh, the thanking of the opponent thing, guys.  I love that.  And I don't know.  You hated him yesterday.  When the crowd goes boo and then they go, no, no, no, no, no.  I can't begin to thank everybody here.  But let me start with my wife, my wife, Lori, who has learned to enjoy college. 
[02:02:00]  His wife, Lori, is petrified standing there.  Yeah.  A little more fact.  Yeah.  He had a full head of hair yesterday.  Wow.  Before they elected him.  That's amazing.  And his wife, Lori, shot Garp.  I can't hear this shit.  I can't hear that.  It's terrible.  This is terrible.  Horrible audio.  Guys, everyone knows.  Everyone knows.  That guy's going to be doing mornings here.  Everyone knows Detroit's a shithole.  And then they put their best foot forward by having the worst audio from the election yesterday. 
[02:02:30]  Acceptance.  Audio.  Terrible.  You want two funny stories about the mayor of Toronto?  I would love him.  All right, then.  Let's go to Mike in Toronto.  In Toronto.  Mikey.  Hey, you guys.  How are you doing?  Hey.  We're doing all right.  We're just talking about you.  So two funny stories.  When the mayor first got into office, he was severely overweight, which hasn't changed.  But he started doing these weekly weigh-ins.  And he had the media cover him running around tracks and all that stuff. 
[02:03:00]  And after about two weeks, he gave up because he said he hurt his knee.  And the media kept asking about it.  And then he just stopped talking about it.  No.  He had good intentions.  He's got no willpower.  And then my other funny story is, I don't know if you guys covered it, but we have this  talk radio station in Toronto.  And he called in as a fake caller named Ian to defend himself on the radio.  Come on.  And the radio just called him out halfway through his call and said, is this Rob Ford, the mayor? 
[02:03:30]  And he hung up.  And he hung up.  We got to find that.  No way.  We got to find that.  He'll be howling.  It's so funny.  How did the fucking guy get elected?  All right.  You know what?  Question.  Because they amalgamated the city, so all the stubborn people voted for him.  Like, no one in the city actually liked him.  So it's a weird situation.  But anyway, you got to find that call because...  We got it, I think, right?  Okay.  We don't need you anymore. 
[02:04:00]  Thanks, Mike.  Later.  Thank you, Mike.  We don't need you.  See you later, Mike.  Thanks for the call.  Go screw.  He's just...  All right.  So what?  Rob?  Well, this clip is them exposing him, but they may play clips within the clip.  I sure hope so.  Okay.  Was indeed the mayor?  Well, I would say 90, 95%.  All right.  Listen, I've met the mayor many times.  I know him pretty well.  I have interviewed him on the show many times.  I want you to listen for a couple of things, okay?  His expressions. 
[02:04:30]  Some of the words that he uses that are very uniquely his.  That little squeak he gets when there's an upper inflection.  This was...  This guy, if he's not the mayor, he could play one on the radio.  I think that the guy who called in to defend the mayor, I think there's a very good chance  that was actually the mayor.  A couple minutes later.  And if it is...  Jesus.  Maybe we'll stop and start the tape as we go here.  We'll play it once, too, and we'll come back and analyze it.  But if it was the mayor, he's giving us an idea of what his defense might be moving forward. 
[02:05:00]  I said there was no video.  I didn't know I was being videoed when it happened.  Uh-huh.  And I asked Robin Doolittle about that earlier in the show.  The Star Reporter said she saw the video.  And as I recall, after talking to the guy from Gawker.com, the...  John Cook.  John Cook, yeah.  Cook.  They said it looked like the mayor was looking right into the camera.  So, you know, that I haven't seen.  I've got to take their word for it.  But if...  And maybe we'll go back and ask them again.  But the police chief said it's pretty much as described earlier. 
[02:05:30]  So, well, that would be easy to tell just looking into the video.  But it's more than that.  It's more than that.  It's not just...  When he said there's no video, we all took that to mean there's no way he was smoking  anything out of a glass pipe with a bunch of guys.  Right?  We all understood.  That's the real message was.  That didn't happen.  So there can't be a tape.  So it sounds like if this is actually...  This caller, Ian, is actually the mayor, his defense is going to be,  I was videotaped and I didn't know it and I wasn't smoking crack cocaine. 
[02:06:00]  All right.  That's where he's going with this.  Let's have a little lesson.  And also, but just one more thing.  Right.  He starts talking about unions.  You hear when he talks about unions, very typical Rob Ford kind of rhetoric.  But you can't fire someone for having a problem.  So he might be planning to come forward saying...  Oh, my God.  Is this how we sound?  That's what I would take from this caller if it is the mayor of Toronto.  Now, if it's the mayor of Toronto, hey, we got the coup, right?  Everybody in the media is going to get him to talk.  I don't know how we're going to be able to prove this. 
[02:06:30]  You're just going to have to go on your own instincts.  It's like to October again.  Let's listen and think about it now, knowing that it might be the mayor.  You tell me.  All right.  Let's analyze it all for ourselves.  Here's Ian from Etobicoke moments ago with us.  Making air quotes, I see.  Yes.  And we started off by asking him if the mayor has anything to answer for.  No, I don't think he has to answer to any of that.  He has personal problems.  And by the way, by the way, if you think you can fire somebody because they have a personal  problem with something like the substance abuse in a union or with a lawyer, you can't. 
[02:07:00]  No, but you can't.  You can't fire them.  You know what?  The mayor's not in a union.  Here's the thing.  Nobody.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you not say that's a union in there?  Nobody's accused the mayor of breaking the law on this show or this station.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Breaking the law.  Okay.  Nobody's accused him of that.  Okay.  First of all, let me get another one across to you.  How do you know when you're being videotaped?  Do you know?  When do you?  Okay.  Sorry.  What was your name?  He does sound like the mayor.  This is Bill.  He's super defensive.  Is this Rob Felt?  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  Okay, Bill.  How many guys have been videotaped last week?  Who am I talking to right now?  How many times have you been videotaped in the last week?  The times that I've looked into the camera once.  Oh, yeah.  You looked at the camera once.  How do you know what you do exactly?  There's cameras everywhere.  Okay.  Okay.  So you're telling me that he goes around and videotapes himself smoking crack?  Rob.  Smart job.  Mayor Ford.  Mayor Ford.  I know your voice.  This is you, isn't it, Mayor Ford?  And away he went. 
[02:08:00]  He dropped the line there.  I got to tell you, Bill.  You might be onto something.  Because he certainly has the cadence of Mayor Ford.  We've all got kind of a vocal signature.  I fucking love this guy.  He's very defensive.  Rob Ford is a nut job.  That did sound like him, too.  So the mayor calls to defend himself as a fake caller.  Wow.  He's just sitting there listening to the radio getting pissed that they're talking about him.  Right.  You got 10-pound balls?  Let's see. 
[02:08:30]  Hey, Mr. Radio Station.  You got Prince Albert in a can?  We've been a little bit before he suffocates.  Is this Rob Ford?  No.  He's just a caller.  Rob Ford.  He's calling to defend Rob Ford.  That was him.  Let's see if there's anything else there.  You talk and listening to that back again, it certainly sounds as if it, well, could be  Rob Ford.  I've spent my entire career listening to voices, editing tape, interviewing people. 
[02:09:00]  I'm almost like a blind guy.  I spend most of my life, like you do, Jeff, just listening to people's voices on the phone.  And people on the phone don't always sound like the way you think they're going to sound,  but I've also interviewed them a lot of times.  He and Doug have a similar tone to their voice.  All right.  I guess they're just going to...  Yeah, now they're just analyzing it.  They can analyze and explain.  It didn't sound like him, though.  That's wild.  And then they call him out, going, is this Rob Ford?  And then he hangs up.  Yeah, he hangs up.  He got us scared.  Let's take a break.  I think we've got Dr. J next. 
[02:09:30]  He should be here any moment, unless he's late.  Hey, I'll be here.  I'm going to go dunk some baskets.  You've got to be careful.  I'll get fluid on the floor.  You'll slip in your converse.  Hurt your hand while you're up there doing slam dunks and whatnot.  He's got a book?  What is it?  Is it just like, hey, I played basketball kind of thing?  It's his life.  It covers...  It's a pretty good book.  He's had some real tragedy.  I finished it last night on the plane.  It's just called Dr. J.  He's a real legend, man. 
[02:10:00]  And he's a very, very interesting story.  And he's got the OCD.  Yeah.  He has a kid because the girl was wearing braces.  Right.  He tried to have sex with eight women in eight days.  He choked out Larry Bird.  Although it seems like he was choking out Larry Bird, but he wasn't.  He was punching him while somebody else choked him.  I watched the video.  It's great.  Jesus.  That's an amazing clip, actually.  You ought to hear my first question.  Where'd you grow up? 
[02:10:30]  That's a good one.  Yeah.  Where'd you grow up?  He explains, I reach out to make sure Larry can't clock me.  I end up with my fingers around his neck.  Because that was a big, big deal back in the day.  I bet.  Was he a booze hound?  No.  Not at all.  He didn't fuck with drugs.  He didn't drink.  Only when they kind of won some shit, he would drink it a little bit.  Yeah.  But he said he was sober.  He was a friend of Richard Pryor, and he said Richard Pryor asked me to hold a bag one  time, and he said no. 
[02:11:00]  I want to ask him about that, because he was in Pryor's bag.  It's probably a smart move.  Yeah.  Probably.  I bet it didn't have apples in it.  Oh, boy.  Well, Dr. J, he was on one other time.  He was great.  Yeah.  And now he's got this really good book out.  Really.  Yeah.  So we'll have him, and then Jason Statham.  And make sure the guests know they can't be late today.  Oh, no.  Because even though we've got a talking to, I'm doing the exact same fucking thing today.  Oh, boy.  10 o'clock on the nose, Sam Roberts.  Correct.  What's Jason promoting?  Are you filming?  It's a movie where, like, it's, you know, some crazy shit starts happening. 
[02:11:30]  He's going to be killing people.  I bet.  Yeah.  But there's some adrenaline that goes through his body.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That should be, I bet you'll be a couple of fast cars in the movie.  Oh, hell yeah.  Wouldn't it be funny if he's playing something else?  Playing the homosexual who falls in love with a man who's fixing my pipes.  He's up there.  I'm sweeping up leaves, and I see the crack of his backside, and I fall in love with him. 
[02:12:00]  And we marry.  We make love a lot.  Me on my back with my legs up there, and him kissing me deep.  And that's how the movie ends.  We're in love, looking at the autumn leaves, the foliage.  That was great, Jason.  Yeah, I'm going to be frolicking a pile of leaves in the foliage.  Frolicking.  Dr. J next.  Oh, boy.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[02:12:30]  Very excited to have Dr. J back on the radio show.  Oh.  There he is.  The great one.  Julius Irving.  Dr. J.  Hello, sir.  Sir, take a seat.  Welcome back to the show.  Thank you.  What's up, brother?  Good to see you.  How are we doing?  No problem.  Good.  You wrote a good book, sir.  Thank you.  An honest book.  Right.  You didn't have to tell all these stories.  Well.  You could have had, like, a fluff book.  Why would I do that?  You could fluff it up a little bit.  40 years ago. 
[02:13:00]  We are on, sir.  40 years ago would have been fluff.  Yeah.  You could sit right there.  We're actually live right now.  Dr. J is a legend.  Settling in.  Yeah, yeah.  Congratulations on the book.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I appreciate it.  Are you happy how it came out?  Very pleased with it.  Right.  Very pleased with it.  You know, for me, it was a family legacy play.  Right.  You know, being the last of my immediate family.  Mom's gone.  Dad's gone.  Stepfather's gone.  Brother's gone. 
[02:13:30]  Sister's gone.  So, you know, I have a new family.  But in terms of Irving and Abney legacy, first person, getting the word out.  You wrote your own book.  As well as for the family.  Right.  To hear it from me while I'm here.  Right.  You wrote in the first person.  I kind of like the style.  A lot.  Yeah.  It was very sad, the part where you talk about, I mean, there's been a lot of deaths that you've dealt with.  But, you know, I wasn't going to mention what you just mentioned, your brothers.  It was really, really sad to read that. 
[02:14:00]  Because the way you, you know, it's like I didn't know him.  But you build up these people from, you know, the stories in the book.  And you kind of, you get somewhat attached to them.  And then you read a chapter.  And you're like, no, no, no.  All right.  He's all right.  And then the next chapter.  It's like, ugh.  But it really was a really well-written, sad moment.  Yeah, the rollercoaster ride of, you know, the highs associated with sports success, academic success, and, you know, I guess success in terms of personal relationships and non-successes. 
[02:14:30]  But, you know, what the public pretty much knows about mostly is, you know, what's reported in terms of, you know, rise and fall of a sports person.  You know, you win or you lose.  You win or you lose.  Come back.  You try again the next year.  So there's a 16-year window in which I was a professional athlete.  But at age 63, you know, now you've got 47 years of accountability and less before than after. 
[02:15:00]  So there's been more, you know, since I walked off the court.  And that's what I wanted to share.  You mentioned your age, 63.  I hear there's a video of you dunking at 63.  Is that true?  Yeah, yeah.  I can throw it down.  I can still throw it down.  You know, it rattles a little bit.  But who cares?  You know, as long as it stays in. 
[02:15:30]  You're still dunking.  And actually, the day when I dunked, we were working on the documentary.  And it was in February.  And I went and I sat for about four hours, you know, being filmed on camera, talking about stuff.  And they said, well, can you dunk a few?  Right.  So I was like, okay.  We've been sitting here.  Been sitting here.  So, you know, lace them up, put on, you know, the shorts and the whole deal, which, you know, you guys have on there right there in front of me right now. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, okay.  It did rot a little bit.  You just got to call that a rubbing.  But that was after sitting for four hours.  And then I go over and I stretch on the bench.  Right.  You know, it's like, you know, you try to stretch for about five or six minutes.  And then, you know, I go in there and I miss.  And then I go in and I make it.  And I said, is that enough?  Right.  Because, you know, you don't want to get hurt.  No.  Do your knees and groins still bother you or is that kind of fun?  Actually, I found this training method. 
[02:16:30]  Can I shamelessly endorse it here?  Oh, please.  It's the next big thing.  It's called Fit Wall.  And it's booming in San Diego and, you know, Southern California right now.  So it's moving east.  But I got two in my basement.  So I go there and I get a cardio workout.  I get a flexibility workout.  And I get a strength workout.  Fit Wall.  And it's head to toe.  It's head to toe.  Fit Wall.  You heard it here.  Yes.  Swimwalking is a big one.  Yeah. 
[02:17:00]  And Dr. J obviously made the slam dunk, you know, popular.  People really weren't dunking before you for whatever reason.  I always saw Chamberlain and Russell, you know, just going and getting over the rim and kind  of laying it down.  But nobody rearing back.  Now, Connie Hawkins was doing that.  You know, he was there.  He'd go down the lane.  And then I remember he had one of the greatest quotes ever because he said, they either got  to lower the rim or raise the floor because the hawk can't soar no more. 
[02:17:30]  And I said, I'm going to have that day happen to me at some point because, you know, once  a year, what are you going to do?  The way you describe the dunking was amazing, too.  Like, when you're going from the foul line or however many feet, it's the things you saw.  Like, you're like, and I noticed that he jumped, but his hand was coming back down, which meant  that he was coming.  Like, you saw so much in that split second that you're up in the air and make a lot of 
[02:18:00]  decisions.  It's not just jump up and throw the ball in.  Yeah, there's a consciousness.  And, you know, when you're in the air, literally it's only a split second.  Right.  And, but it could seem like more, you know, if you move the ball from left hand to right  hand or, you know, the way they do it now, the guys go behind their backs, they go under  the legs.  They do a whole lot of freaky stuff that we didn't do.  But because I could palm the ball and Connie Hawkins could palm the ball and some other 
[02:18:30]  guys, you know, we would maneuver it around and make it very difficult for shot blockers.  But I used to always think, you know, it was an attack in the basket.  Just look for daylight.  And if there was a head or a shoulder or a hand, there's no daylight there.  So you go where that's not.  Right.  And, you know, have fun with it.  Some famous, famous Dr. J shots where he's just twisting and turning.  And the air is just amazing. 
[02:19:00]  The one thing I learned about reading your book was that you kind of, I always just thought  you were Dr. J your entire basketball career, but you came out of nowhere.  You almost didn't make it into the pros.  Right?  It's funny you should say that.  I did not realize that.  I thought you were like a superstar and everyone knew about you from a very early age, but that's  not the truth here.  There's so many assumptions, right?  And I really came in the side door and caught a lot of people by surprise.  That amazes me.  And one of the things was, I guess, with UMass getting snubbed two years in which we won 
[02:19:30]  our conference, but we didn't have automatic bids to the NCAA tournament.  And that was the bigger tournament, 32 teams.  And there was 16 to the NIT.  But we won our conference, we got recognized by the NIT, then we got eliminated in the  first round, both years to the eventual champions, which were Marquette and North Carolina.  And so it was easy to be overlooked.  And even after my sophomore year, in which I was one of the nation's leading scorers and 
[02:20:00]  second in the nation in rebounding, they said, well, we want to get all the young players  together, you know, in Colorado and get ready for the Olympics.  So I was snubbed in as well.  And my coach, Jack Lehman, who's no longer with us, he pushed hard, got me on the alternates  list.  A couple of guys got hurt.  So I go out as an alternate and now I end up being the leading scorer and rebounder in  the camp and, you know, go on a nice tour of Russia, Poland and Finland at age 20, lead 
[02:20:30]  the team in scoring and rebounding.  Didn't you say Russia was a real dump where you were in Poland?  Well, the courts were very inferior, you know, so as well as the food, I'm sure it's changed  now.  Yeah, but back then it kind of sucked.  But Finland was pretty cool, you know, it was bright and never got dark and, you know,  it was a new experience for, you know, a bunch of young guys going over there and hanging  out.  But after Russia and Poland, man, it was so good to get back to that.  You know, it was the proverbial, I got to kiss the seat, I got to kiss the sidewalk when 
[02:21:00]  I get home.  Yeah, yeah.  But even though you were a great player, you were being overlooked and then, you know,  a little luck there.  Or we wouldn't know you as Dr. J.  Yeah, you know, I was a doctor in high school and through college.  Me and my best buddy, you know, we coined nicknames.  But it became Dr. J in Virginia.  And, you know, with Bob Travolini, who was a trainer, he came up with Dr. J.  And because they used to call the, one of the other trainers was Doc. 
[02:21:30]  And then they had the physician, team physician.  He was Doc.  So I couldn't just be Doc.  So I had to be Dr. J.  And they started promoting Charlie, the great Scott and Julius, Dr. J.  Irving.  And Virginia Squires are coming to town.  Watch out for these guys.  Right.  ABA.  How long did you lisp for?  Before I forget, you lisp.  Oh, that was in my elementary school days. 
[02:22:00]  I lisp too.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Okay.  I'll tell you, you know, a large percentage of people in the world.  And I have a 12-year-old son.  And, you know, he did it between ages five and eight.  Yeah.  So they went away.  Now you can't shut them up.  I can't shut you up either.  No, no.  I like to chat.  But don't you hate an adult lisperer?  I think now we can get that cleared up.  Because you and I both lisp as children and we've overcome it. 
[02:22:30]  And I think that we can agree that adult lispers are truly enraging.  You know, you have to address it.  Yeah.  It's like, how about you put your teeth together and make that sound?  I did that when I was seven.  I learned it.  You did?  Yeah.  So did Dr. J.  You say this and that?  Yeah.  It's silly.  When I see an adult doing that, oh, come on.  It's so stupid.  They just want to mash their tongue between their teeth and sever it.  Teach them to talk properly.  The other thing that amazed me in the book was, and I was a huge fan of yours, you leave 
[02:23:00]  basketball in 87.  And you only have, I say only just because of what they're making nowadays.  You only had $9 million.  That amazes me.  So you didn't really get a taste of the really, really big salaries, right?  No.  And I think there were, you know, guys who never made an all-star team who got the $9 million  very quick in the 90s.  Yes.  Like, I mean, only a few years later, like you missed it by two or three years where they  were really making the monster contracts.  Yeah.  We thank David Stern for that. 
[02:23:30]  And obviously, the players like myself and Kareem and others who were, you know, the foundation  for that platform, and Michael, of course, with the endorsements and the globalization  of the sport.  You know, it all happened very quickly.  And, you know, I hate to say that we missed the boat because, you know, there are things  that influence your life, and obviously, economics are one of those things. 
[02:24:00]  So in terms of working hard and supporting your family and taking on new challenges and  finding ways to get it done afterwards, you know, I mean, if I quit basketball in 1987 and  I said, well, I'm set for the rest of my life, I don't think I would be the individual that  I am today.  Yeah, yeah.  So by not being, so by being very conscious of not being set for my life, you know, work  ethic was still there and taking on new challenges, trying different things.  I mean, I became a Coca-Cola bottler for one thing, and, you know, went on some public company 
[02:24:30]  and private company boards, and just began to expand my business horizon.  And through good fortune, you know, I've been able to almost get there, where a lot  of things are taken care of.  I can't say, you know, we're taken care of for the rest of our lives, because, you know,  I think the more you make, the more you spend.  But you lost, my follow-up is, you lost a lot of the money. 
[02:25:00]  You know, you had the $9 million and then a few bad investments, then it really kind of  dropped you down a bit for a while, huh?  Well, you know, I don't think you should get locked in on that number.  I mean, I've had a net worth of $20 plus.  There you go.  So, you know, so I've been there and had setbacks, climbed back, and, you know, it's a rollercoaster  ride just like life.  Right, right, yeah.  Did you really give away between $6 and $10 million to people who are coming to you for  help or whatever?  Absolutely.  Wow. 
[02:25:30]  Absolutely.  With no form of repayment or no desire to get paid back, or were there a lot of loans that  just never...  They said it was no desire to get paid back.  Oh, okay.  There's a thing...  I didn't say that.  The desire is there.  There's a thing, when you make a lot of money, I've handed out a lot of money, and there's  always this, I don't know, understanding on their part that you're, oh, you have so much  money, of course you don't want it back.  So there's not even a thought of, look, I'll try to pay you back someday. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, the problem is when, you know, when you guys are walking down the street and they  cross the street to avoid you.  Oh, man.  That becomes a problem, because there'll be a lot of friendships that have been lost.  Yeah.  Over, you know, loans and...  What's the biggest hunk someone had the balls to ask for?  Not that you gave it to them, but what's the biggest hunk that you were like, you son  of a bitch just asked me for this much, that they didn't have the right to ask for?  Six figures.  It should be over $100,000. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  I had someone in my family do the exact same thing, and then they couldn't understand  why I didn't come up with it.  I'm like, I don't know how much money you think I have, but I can't just throw $100,000  at you.  And it wasn't a brother or sister, just so I want to make that clear, but someone that  was in dire straits came to me and said they need $100,000.  I'm like, I'm not giving you $100,000, I'll give you a couple thousand.  Wow, someone that wasn't even family?  Yeah, yeah.  Family.  And sometimes that's a little more extended.  Sometimes that's the strategy.  Right.  Ask for a lot. 
[02:27:00]  Right.  And they go, you know, you'll come up with a little something.  Right.  Negotiating.  And they really get what they really want.  Right, right.  And then this person was very disappointed in me that I didn't do it.  Yeah.  I'm like, look, I got family and, you know, other responsibilities here.  Yeah.  I can't come up with that.  There are things.  People fall from grace.  I mean, they go to jail.  They die.  You know what I mean?  I've had, by living as long as I've had, I probably, there's probably six to ten people  on that list of people who borrow money who can't get paid back because they're dead. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, that's it.  We'll see that money no more.  Well, that's like the ultimate test.  Right.  Nobody passes the ultimate test.  That's right.  Richard Pryor.  Richard Pryor did that.  Oh, I like you.  That was, is it something I said?  The ultimate test.  Yeah.  Jimmy's a huge Richard Pryor fan.  I actually wrote that question now because you talk about Pryor and that you were friends  with him.  No, I bet.  We were acquaintances.  Oh, you didn't hang out.  Okay.  Yeah.  You know, we never had that tight friendship.  What did they ask you to hold? 
[02:28:00]  Nothing.  You never hold anything for Richard Pryor.  No, what are you at?  The question was, what did he ask you to hold?  Like in the bag.  We know he didn't do it.  What did he ask you to hold?  Yeah.  In the bag?  Yeah.  You know, that's part of one of his jokes.  You know, he always had, you know, something in the bag and you should never hold a bag if  Richard Pryor asked you to hold it.  Oh, okay.  There could be drugs in it.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it's, it's kind of like an old one.  Was he nice to you?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I mean, when, you know, I've had special relationships and multiple, multiple relationships 
[02:28:30]  with the entertainers and, you know, the entertainers all want to be athletes and the athletes all  want to be entertainers.  You know, and, you know, my renditions of people's songs and monologues and stuff like  that is, you know, best kept in the shower, kept in tight quarters.  Although with, who was it?  When Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had his roast and I had George Lopez there and I did a little 
[02:29:00]  version of a standup as a way of roasting Kareem.  And George gave me a high five on that one.  He says, oh man, I'm glad to be a witness to your first standup.  I loved it.  Bam.  So I was like, that might be validation.  Was it nice to roast him?  Oh, I had to roast him, man.  You know, I've been in the shadow for a lot of years, you know, from, and, you know, even 
[02:29:30]  though he was two years ahead of me, coming out of New York, being a New York, you know,  ball player, flying under the radar.  You're really under the radar when you got Lou Alcindor and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on the  radar.  So I think I was probably runner up three or four times in the NBA for MVP, second to him.  So, yeah, being in the shadow.  So it was good to roast him.  Can you explain what led?  Because, you know, you talk about it in the book.  You were seeing, you know, you would have this female, I think her name was Samantha, 
[02:30:00]  sports writer would come and.  From Philly.  Yeah.  Um, and, uh, can you explain how you, how she got pregnant?  That's one of my favorite stories that anyone's ever told about anything.  What did you read?  Uh, that normally she would just come and give you oral sex, but this time she got braces.  So you couldn't, uh, have oral sex because she had metal in her mouth.  So you, you had sex that one time and she got pregnant.  When you say metal in her mouth, what do you mean? 
[02:30:30]  Oh, braces.  Oh, I didn't say she had metal in her mouth, did I?  Um, well you said, no, you said some type of tin or something that wasn't conducive with  oral sex.  Well, you said you, I forget you named the, you named it as metal or something in the mouth.  That was, I think I named it for what it was.  I mean, she had, you know, uh, she had, uh, braces.  Yeah, but there was another word you used for, I don't remember what it was.  Yeah, I just, I can't remember, but you said something.  Orthodontia.  It just says, orthodontia to straighten her teeth. 
[02:31:00]  There you go.  Orthodontia.  That night and that night only they had intercourse.  Oh, okay.  Maybe you did say orthodontia.  It was something else.  It was describing something unpleasant.  Very high level when you say orthodontia.  That's right.  It is nice with a metal in the mouth.  Well.  So, is that true?  I mean, is that.  Yeah.  I mean, the book is factual.  So it's based on fact, as I recall it.  But, um, you know, there's no disputing from my standpoint.  And this is a first person book. 
[02:31:30]  So, uh, so I think that's, that's when it happened.  It certainly wasn't planned parenthood.  Right, right.  Right.  Yeah, you were married at the time and then you got the letter that, uh, you know.  Yeah, I was 30 years old.  Yeah.  So some things you look back on at 11, 21, 31, 41.  And, you know, you look back on and if, if, uh, if you had to do it over again, you probably  would do it a little differently.  Yeah.  You know, in that situation, the, uh, the blessing in disguise is that, you know, a beautiful, 
[02:32:00]  uh, young lady who has made a contribution to the world.  A very talented tennis player.  Came out of that relationship.  Came out of that relationship.  But the arrangement you had.  So your wife at the time basically said, look, you do everything that's right.  You know, make sure you pay child support or whatever.  But she didn't want you to really, uh, have any contact with Samantha at the time.  Yeah.  Do you have some more presence?  Well, it became a East Coast, West Coast. 
[02:32:30]  Right.  Because Samantha moved to San Diego.  And so, so that in itself, geography was going to lessen the contact.  And I, you know, I mean, I saw her several times while she was growing up.  Did she know you were her dad all along?  Um, yeah, she knew.  I mean, I, I met her within the first five years of her life.  Oh, okay.  So, so she.  I always, I always thought that she didn't know until later on.  Right.  No, no.  We met, uh, in the first five years of her life. 
[02:33:00]  In terms of, uh, the later meeting.  I mean, it was after she was 16.  Okay.  Uh, you know, when, I mean, obviously we became public when she was 18.  Right.  19, actually.  But, uh, but privately she knew.  How did your wife find out about, I guess you had to tell her.  How did she find out about it?  No, I, I write it in the book.  You know, there was, Samantha wrote me a letter.  And, uh, read the letter and I shared it with my wife.  You showed her the letter? 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  I showed her the letter.  And then she beat, I was going to say she beat the crap out of you.  That's not fair.  But there was, uh, there was, uh, there was some punches, uh, thrown right after that.  And she, can I say what she called you?  Well, the reaction, yeah.  I don't, I mean, it's tough.  I mean, you don't have to grind it out.  But, yeah, because it is, because it is, because it is a read.  And it's in the book.  And in the context.  Right.  You know, we're talking about children.  So, that particular chapter, and, you know, I mean, I have four sons, three daughters. 
[02:34:00]  So, so we're talking about children and people being born into this world.  So, the circumstances vary with each childbirth and with this particular situation, you know,  there's, there's additional, uh, um, information there, which balances the perspective.  Right.  Because I wanted to be transparent and truthful.  So, so yes, I mean, you know, when I, when I told her about it, she was very upset.  You know, I mean, she really asked me to leave the house.  You know, I was trying to get out of the house, because I was getting bombarded, and, uh, verbally and physically. 
[02:34:30]  So, I left the house.  Hmm.  Man.  A couple days.  Were you, were you concerned at first?  I would have thought, like, ah, we had sex one time, it wasn't mine.  Or did you kind of know that it was your, like, dad?  No, no, I didn't, I didn't know.  No, no, we had to, you know, test.  Yeah, there was a test that happened.  And we had to validate through testing, um, and, um, test came back positive.  So, uh.  Had to own up. 
[02:35:00]  Hmm.  Well, there were other women up there.  And, you know, and, you know, obviously, in, uh, the 70s and 80s, I mean, you know, free love, hippies.  I mean, so, deadbeats, deadbeats abound.  I mean, you guys probably knew a few.  Or whatever.  I got a child over here, but, you know.  So, I'm assuming there were a few other tests.  I'm in, you're in denial.  Right.  So, so, so, so, so they're in, so they're in denial.  And, and, uh, you know, I mean, I, I had my moments in which I had my doubts. 
[02:35:30]  Mm-hmm.  But, you know, the test proved positive.  I said, well, you know, this is what we have to do.  And, and it was a collective decision made to, uh, create a child support situation and  a living arrangement that, uh, allowed me to continue, you know, with my wife and my  family understanding and for Samantha and Alexandra to, uh, exist as they did. 
[02:36:00]  But, how's your relationship with her now?  Um, I wouldn't say it's the best, you know, and, you know, the book hasn't made it any  better.  Mm-hmm.  The book hasn't made it any better.  But, you know, these are part of the challenges in life.  So, uh, when and if, I mean, there will be a time in which, you know, I have to deal with  the accountability associated with being a father.  Uh, and, and, uh, you know, I mean, I feel there's responsibility there, but there's 
[02:36:30]  also, um, an understanding that at age 32, she's an adult.  And, you know, at 63, I'm an adult.  So, we have to, we have to, uh, communicate with each other as adult to adult.  Uh, you said something Bill Cosby told you that it's hard to be, it's hard to grow up  poor and raise rich kids, which I thought was a really interesting way to look at what  it's like to be in that situation. 
[02:37:00]  Um, yeah, I think the difficulty of affluence, uh, is, you know, personifies itself because  you have so many choices, you know, that you didn't have.  I mean, I went to Prospect Elementary School because it was the local school and I walked  and probably, you know, seemed like three miles.  It was probably a mile, uh, especially when it was cold and wintry, you know, and kind  of in Long Island, you know, put your coats on, bundle up and, you know, you got to go 
[02:37:30]  to school and you got to try to be there on time.  And then, then within that system, you start saying, well, I never want to be late.  I never want to be absent.  And I want to be one of those kids, you know, that has never late, never absent.  So, you know, my kids really didn't have to deal with that.  You know, they got chauffeured to school.  I'm the chauffeur or the mom's the chauffeur or we have a driver, you know, who's, who's,  who's taking them and picking them up and dropping them off.  Yeah.  And, uh, and, and within the, uh, the education and the social development, so many options 
[02:38:00]  for, you know, people who are fluent that you, you're forced to make decisions that, you  know, when you're poor, you don't have, you don't have to make, you know, it's only one  option.  Go or you stay home, you know, get smart or stay dumb.  Uh, and that's oversimplifying it, but that's the reality of it.  So that, so that's what that was all about.  Do you still line everything up?  I was fascinated by how you line, like right now you're, no, I'm looking at you still, you 
[02:38:30]  have your, it's not, uh, but it struck me as very, like having stuff organized over  here.  It struck me as very, very OCD to have, uh, you know, all of this stuff lined up and have  you, have you ever thought of yourself as OCD?  What's that?  Uh, obsessive compulsive disorder, like the, the obsession over things being lined up or  numbers or, like a lot of athletes get it with time.  Just when they spell my name, I-R-V-I-N-G, I have a little problem with that.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, what he's talking about is the, the, whatever dummy made up our prep sheet, which wasn't 
[02:39:00]  even in here, spelled it right on this side, but here they spelled it Dr. Julius Irving.  He'll give props to Kyrie on that one.  What the, they spelled his name wrong on the overall, I like order, I like things nice.  Oh, God, we know, lines, lines and columns, you know, it's, I like it, but athletes, I'm  probably not sick because of it, but, but, but I, but I like it.  I prefer, I prefer order versus disorder.  I don't think it's a surprise because athletes have their routine, right? 
[02:39:30]  You probably had a nice routine game day and everything had to be just right.  No question, Gerald Wooden's Ten Principles, Pat Riley, Pyramid of Success, you know, they,  I mean, all of those things ring true in terms of being more successful and, you know, you  try to, I guess, include anything that's going to give you a bit of an advantage.  So, if, if you have a great day and you've done things a certain way, you tend to go back  and try to do that same thing and, and sports does introduce you to that. 
[02:40:00]  What do you think of the game today?  What's your thoughts?  You know, the game's in pretty good shape.  I think, I think David's moving on, Adam's taking over and he's, he's leaving it much  better than it was when he started.  So, his legacy is cemented and stoned.  And, you know, I, I mean, I watched the game.  Obviously, there's some bad games and some bad nights, but, you know, there's so much 
[02:40:30]  exposure that the guys get.  So, you get to, you know, see them in a way that you didn't in the past because there's  so much exposure.  I mean, you, you see the bad games and you see guys having bad nights and then they got  to come back the next night and shake it off and, and play.  So, uh, even the superstars, uh, with the scrutiny that you have, I mean, it's amazing that,  um, you know, the sport continues to become more popular. 
[02:41:00]  Um, and, uh, and, and guys are able to handle it.  I mean, everybody can't handle it because, you know, there's some cases out there, you  know, where, uh, they clearly can't handle, uh, becoming a corporation at age, you know,  18, 19, 20, 21.  And, you know, there's an understanding of that.  So, I think the league and the higher ups in the league understand that they got to give  coaching, they got to give training way beyond just the physical training of, you know, having 
[02:41:30]  a guy understand the fundamentals of the game.  There's, there's the, uh, fundamentals of the business and it, and it is a huge business.  It's a multi-billion dollar business.  And, you know, as you always say, the chain zone is as strong as the weakest link.  So, um, so it's, it's a constant, uh, feeding or exchange of information to try and make  it better.  And I think that's what makes it, um, best league in the world.  I got to ask you about Larry Berg.  When was the last time you talked to him? 
[02:42:00]  Uh, you know, when Indiana was in the playoffs last year, I went and I did a game, uh, for  TV and, uh, got with the TNT guys and, uh, hung out in Indiana for a couple of days.  So, uh, you know, we just said hi and hired by, you know, it's not like we tight, but I  think there's a mutual respect there.  I mean, I really admire what he's been able to do in terms of, uh, moving into the executive  position that he, that he has and pretty much calling his own shots.  It's helped to assemble a wonderful franchise out there and I'm an old ABA guy. 
[02:42:30]  So I pull for all the ABA teams, you know, so I, there's always going to be a soft spot  in my heart for, not, not, not so soft.  It's come, I'm mad for Indiana, Indiana.  I'm mad that you got a 76ers hat on instead of a Nets hat.  That, but you shouldn't be mad about that.  I'm mad.  Uh, you know, it was a choice.  I'm a Long Island guy.  It was a choice to make.  And I, and since I had the blue jeans instead of the black jeans, I went for the color.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  But I got, I got my Nets hat.  All right.  You got your Nets hat.  Okay.  I'm probably going to wear it tomorrow. 
[02:43:00]  Okay.  Good.  You want to come and have lunch tomorrow?  I love the ABA and I love the Nets, man.  Yeah.  I love it.  You know, the Nets, Spurs, Nuggets, and the Pacers.  I mean, I got a Conquistadors.  How about that one?  Remember the San Diego Conquistadors?  I do.  Wilt Chamberlain.  Yeah.  And, uh, Bird Everett.  Wow.  Very good.  Travis and Gene Grant.  Your book signing.  Sorry.  They want us to mention your book signings, too.  If you want to, uh, get a book signed. 
[02:43:30]  The book is excellent.  It really is.  I love it.  Very honest.  I love when you guys write an honest book.  A lot, you know, we don't see it often.  We really don't.  We, you know, we read a lot of these books, but Dr. J, you did, yeah, you did yourself  right, man.  What's today's date?  Uh, the, uh, 6th.  Okay.  So tomorrow night, the 7th, here, it's in New Jersey in Northvale.  It's, uh, Books and Greetings at 6 p.m.  And then the 9th, which is, uh, I don't know what day that is, uh, but we're on in Atlanta.  Saturday the 9th at Peachtree Road, Barnes & Noble in Atlanta, Georgia. 
[02:44:00]  Right.  Uh, the 13th, which is...  Wednesday.  Thank you.  Uh, four days after that, uh, Wednesday will be at Barnes & Noble in, uh, uh, Exton, Pennsylvania  on Main Street.  And then, uh, the 19th, which is, uh, Tuesday the 19th at Barnes & Noble.  No, that's, that's actually December 19th.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  A lot of counting on your fingers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, let's just leave it at those three.  That'll be in L.A.  Yeah.  Okay.  Jersey, Atlanta, and Exton, Pennsylvania coming up to meet Dr. J and get your book signed. 
[02:44:30]  And it really was great.  Do we have time for one more question?  It's a good one.  Yeah.  It's not, I'm not going to put you in a tough spot.  Okay.  We've, we saw recently the clip of you, uh, getting taken out of the game with the 76ers.  It was so damn emotional.  And everyone knew it was, it was coming where they were going to take you out for the curtain  call.  What goes through your mind?  That's, I mean, that is it.  They're taking you out of the game for the last time.  Yeah.  Do you remember exactly what you were thinking?  Well, I, you know, I mean, I'm a, I mean, I'm a candid guy, right? 
[02:45:00]  So the, the emotions ran the gamut.  You know, I wanted to play well.  I mean, that last game had 24 points, 11 rebounds.  So I wasn't leaving because I couldn't play anymore.  You know, I was leaving because I was able to go out the front door in terms of my basketball  career and my chosen profession.  And whereas I came in the side door, so I had announced, this is my last year. 
[02:45:30]  Now we were in the last playoff game, you know, against a team that we respected a whole lot.  They were, the Milwaukee Philadelphia rivalry was great during that time.  And they had Bob Lanier, Marcus Johnson and, uh, Junior Bridgman and, uh, Paul Pierce.  I mean, they had, they had a monster team, Quinn Buckner and, and we had a monster team,  but we were so close to one another.  And we always ended up a little bit ahead of them, but not this night. 
[02:46:00]  Right.  So, so, uh, so I'm, you know, I'm thinking that, okay, the run is over.  Um, yeah, a lot of people are going to be sad, you know, but I wanted to celebrate that moment.  And, and I, and I also wanted to celebrate the freedom from living in the fish tank, living  in the fishbowl, you know, because, you know, I had, you know, live in a fishbowl for 16 years 
[02:46:30]  and those last 11 in, in the NBA and, and there were circumstances, some of which we've talked  about today that were personal and private and, and unaddressable truly in this, in, in the,  in a whole form, uh, while I was living in the fishbowl.  Um, so part of my mission, you know, for after 1987, you know, getting out of the fishbowl 
[02:47:00]  was to, you know, show up my private life and, you know, for the next two years, you  know, most of the things that I did, I mean, I wanted to pull back from the public arena  and, you know, charge my battery and, and, you know, uh, exercise certain options, you  know?  So I did go on private situations, private corporate situations.  I, I still did, did public stuff, but one of the things I turned down was, you know,  the lifetime contract that the Sixers offered to come and, you know, work for the organization 
[02:47:30]  and, and, you know, maybe, you know, do what Larry Bird has done, you know, help, help build  a franchise, uh, into a, into a winner and, you know, stay in the same arena, you know, it's  important for me to, you know, get out and try new things and, uh, and start fulfilling  the, uh, the destiny for Julius Irving.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  You know, kind of set, set Dr. J on the side.  So it was a sense of relief.  You were ready to move on.  You were ready to move on. 
[02:48:00]  Huge, huge, huge, huge, huge sense of relief.  You were like.  Huge sense of relief.  So that, so that was what was going through my mind and I'm walking out with the ball and,  uh, the referees had had a little threat put on them.  Uh, so the two referees are walking with me and they tell me when they get in the hallway,  they said, you know, there was a threat on us before this game.  I don't know why, but we figured if we walked out for you, they're not going to take the  shot.  So, so I'm like, thanks. 
[02:48:30]  Wow.  I suppose they did decide to take the shot.  And no regrets.  No regrets.  Oh, at the end of the day, 16 years.  You left when you wanted to.  Sweet 16.  Uh, I couldn't have asked for more.  I mean, I, coming in that side door.  I mean, I, I always thought, you know, when they, when they, even when they talk now,  five or six years, average length of time for a professional's career, professional basketball  player's career, football's even shorter.  You know, baseball's probably the longest hockey's longer, but on the average, because 
[02:49:00]  some guys are just there for a cup of coffee, it's, it's five or six years.  So once I got past 10, I mean, I was in the gravy zone.  And I got all the way to 16 and, uh, and, you know, and I have, I have a lot of statistics  that are longevity stats.  You know, if you're around long enough, you know, I leave game is third leading scorer  and pro basketball history, first in steals, top 10 in block shots.  Yeah.  So those are longevity stats. 
[02:49:30]  And if you're not around a long time, you don't get there.  Right.  Right on.  They're saying you got to go.  You got to go.  Yep.  But, uh, thank you very much.  And I love the book.  Really did.  I love it.  I appreciate that.  Absolutely.  Dr. J.  Appreciate you need and the time to talk to you about it.  Come back and see us, man.  Okay.  We'll do.  All right.  Dr. J.  Everyone.  Uh, I don't know if we could break because we got Jason Statham outside.  Oh, we do.  Don't we want to do a quick break?  Real quick.  Yeah, we can do two minutes.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM. 
[02:50:00]  And now, back to The Opie and Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  We're back.  Ah.  Opie is dropping a quick deuce.  Oh, is he?  He actually started shitting into his hand as he was walking down the hallway so he could  be ready.  Let's just bring Jason in.  Yes.  There he is.  Jason Statham.  Hey, Jason.  How you been?  Hello, what's up?  What's up, man?  You will.  Good, good.  Yourself?  I'm all here, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You smell good again.  The usual seat.  Okay. 
[02:50:30]  All right.  Jason's in a home front.  Looks pretty badass, actually.  Did I get a DVD or anything?  No, I've seen Trilla, though.  Yeah.  Oh, you have?  Yeah.  You look like, you're fighting a meth kingpin.  That's right.  This time.  Yeah.  This one.  Now you're kicking his ass.  He gets a share, yeah.  And it's like, you've got to protect your family.  Family's first.  Right, right.  I like, you know what?  It's always tough.  You play those video games where you've got to kind of protect someone else in the video 
[02:51:00]  game.  It's the biggest pain in the ass.  Like, I like just barreling in, shooting and stuff.  Now you've got to protect somebody.  And that's not normally you.  Well, it is.  You're normally one person or something.  Maybe in the trunk of the car you've got to protect.  It's very distracting.  For the most part, yeah.  You're taking care of yourself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's better.  The selfish way.  Right.  The selfish way.  But now you've got, like, you know, the family.  Big pain in the ass.  Proper.  Yeah. 
[02:51:30]  It's too much time.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, run and gun.  I like the run and gun.  I want to see you come in one time and promote a movie about a guy who opens a greenhouse and  develops a love with the flowers.  And a gentleman friend comes in and they become roommates.  Oh, my God.  That would be great.  Every day I come in with a hose.  Just sprinkle it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yes.  Irrigation.  Irrigator.  How the flowers are growing.  Do you ever have the urge to kind of break out and do a role that's completely not you? 
[02:52:00]  Something like that.  Not you, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  Something like the old leading man rom-com thing.  Oh, I'd look such an idiot trying that one.  Do you think?  I mean, like I said, I don't really, you know, I don't have any sort of traditional experience  in acting.  Right, right.  I'm just winging it anyway.  I mean, so to try and do something ways away from, you know, what I'm doing right now  might be a bit of a huge mistake. 
[02:52:30]  You complete me, you twat.  Yeah.  Down plays his acting every time he's in here.  I think at this point, I think you're a good actor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't fake it this long.  Yeah, well, I probably can.  Living proof.  Right.  Me old chap.  No, because it is kind of a subdued thing until you start kicking ass.  Yeah, I mean, this is a good, it's a great script.  You know, this was written by Sylvester Stallone. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, right, yeah.  For himself, it was going to be the last installment of Rambo.  No kidding.  Jeez.  And he wrote it in 208, and it's an adaptation of a book written by Chuck Logan.  And he just thought it was going to be great for him to be the last chapter of Rambo.  But, you know, things changed.  We started to write The Expendables.  He did another Rocky instead.  Right.  So a lot of things got in the way of him doing this movie.  So it was there on the shelf gathering dust, and it was a really great script. 
[02:53:30]  So when we were shooting Expendables 2, he said, I've got this little thing that, you  know, I was going to do.  I'd like to read it.  And, you know, it's like the greatest compliment you can get, you know, to have a script written  for himself, you know, handed to me.  So it was like, and then after I read it, it was great.  And just begged him and begged him.  And then go, gun, and say, please let me do it.  I love how he could just go, ah, you do this one.  Yeah, I'm not going to.  Ah, you do this one. 
[02:54:00]  I know it's going to be great, but I don't feel like doing it.  Does everybody who knew Rambo go, like, your accent, you sound different.  Why are you so skinny?  You don't sound the same anymore.  Obviously, there was a fucking rewrite.  Is Sylvester Stallone cool or what?  Yeah, he used to be.  He is, right?  We had him on once, and we really liked him.  Oh, he's so funny.  He's just, he's a real, he's a unique chap.  He's just so, he's so talented, and he's just a real person, you know. 
[02:54:30]  He's had a lot of experience, so he's got some killer stories.  But, you know, he really cares about what he does, and he, you know, it shows.  People really like him.  I think there was a little rift on the Expendables between him and Bruce Willis.  Something was going on.  Right.  I'm not sure what that was.  I was just, I wasn't going to say anything.  I was going to be like, look, you don't have to say anything.  Let's see how he handles this.  I was like, let me see how he handles this.  Let's see how he handles this.  He handles this like a diplomatic actor that doesn't want to lose any work. 
[02:55:00]  I've heard nothing about that.  All right, the microphones are off, please.  Now tell us.  Wow, you're a politician.  That's smart, though.  That is very smart.  We can learn from you.  What am I supposed to do?  Tell the real truth.  Exactly.  Were you surprised that Bruce was making a million dollars a day?  Because they said that's what it was.  What?  He wanted to make a million dollars a day, I think.  Or he wanted, it was like, he was getting a million for four days.  And he wanted to make a million a day.  So he either wanted four million or three days. 
[02:55:30]  That's OP money.  Wow.  Yeah.  What?  Really?  Wow.  What happened?  Keep you stocked up in baked beans for quite a while.  That's it, right?  It certainly would.  Yeah, but he doesn't know.  Yeah.  He wasn't around that day.  I wasn't around that day.  No one talked about it.  I was watching the football.  Right.  See?  Jason shows up for the job, does it to the best of his ability, keep the drama away.  He doesn't deal with the nonsense.  And keep working.  You don't want to badmouth people like Bruce Willis or, you know, spill the beans there. 
[02:56:00]  Well, what are we going to learn?  I know.  We're the worst at it.  Although Kevin Smith was pretty honest about Bruce Willis when he worked with him.  Yeah.  See, and that has nothing to do with Jason Statham.  Well, it's that he's a big pain in the ass, is basically what he's saying.  He's a big pain in the ass to work with.  Right.  And, you know, when he's on set, he's on set.  Right.  He's going to screw everybody else.  See, I didn't find that.  My experience with him was very good.  Oh, you did a scene with Bruce Willis.  Yeah, it was very good.  I felt that he was very nurturing and nice. 
[02:56:30]  Did you?  Yeah, he was good.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Still like those diehard movies.  I don't know.  What are you going to do?  They're great films.  And the first one is just one of the classic definitive genre movies.  That's it.  Yeah.  That's the movie.  So great.  Great villain.  Do you watch action films when you're not filming them?  When I'm filming them.  No, when you're not.  Or do you want to, like, kind of get away from that whole genre?  I don't know.  I mean, a lot of them are crap, so, I mean, it's hard to get a good one unless you have 
[02:57:00]  to have the right people in it, I think.  Right.  I mean, a lot of the time, they're a little bit thin on story and a little bit, you know,  predictable.  But they're good popcorn films.  So it depends what it is.  I mean, I'll watch every one of the diehards.  I think, like you said a minute ago, they're great.  Yeah.  Um, I do like, uh, I do like, um, I do like a good action film, but it depends what's out  at the time when you're making films.  You know, nowadays, you just have to look and see what, see what's on the old iTunes.  I like the, I like the Mission Impossibles. 
[02:57:30]  I thought, I thought those were pretty good.  Yeah.  Very good.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Right.  Do you, do you get pulled, do you get pulled over driving and have people be like, oh,  Christ, it's this guy.  Because I can only imagine a cop pulling over and going, oh, of course.  I can't give him a ticket.  Driving facts probably, you know.  He proves he could drive real well.  Sir, you were doing 475 in a school zone?  Yeah.  Are you, are you civil on the road or, or?  Yeah.  You know what?  I, I'm, I'm very civil on the road.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, I used to be a little bit more reckless when I was, uh, you know, a lot younger. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, we used to race from, uh, I used to live in North London and we used to, we used  to have a, uh, a pool that we used to train at when I was back in the day doing, doing  a bit of high diving.  Uh, and we used to drive from North London to Southeast London and we used to race through  the, uh, through the city as, as quick as we could.  We used to race every week.  We used to have these crappy little GTIs, you know, these like three door, two door hatchbacks.  Yeah.  Tiny little things. 
[02:58:30]  Uh, my friend had a Gordini turbo, uh, little Renault.  Uh, yeah.  We was just idiots with the music on trying to, you know, beat each other down to the  other pool.  Yeah.  And you never, uh, get pulled over and.  No, but not really.  Not in the city.  It's hard because you know, there's not any sort of, um, if you're going through a congested  city, it's, it's a lot less likely you're going to get pulled with a, you know, a guy  with a, you know, a speed sort of, um, speed gun.  What's the fastest you've gone?  Have you ever clocked yourself?  What's your number? 
[02:59:00]  It's got a number.  What's your number at?  It was like, uh, 160.  You did 160.  I thought 160.  Yeah.  That's.  Yeah.  I borrowed a Lamborghini for the weekend.  Yeah.  Meat poop will ring its neck.  Have you gone faster 160 on, on regular roads?  Uh, no.  I'm not talking on a track or anything, by the way.  Just on the regular roads.  No, on the regular roads.  No, that's crazy.  Holy shit.  No, that was on a track.  I never did 160 on a regular road.  Yeah, that's what I mean on a regular road.  Oh, you're probably 120, 130.  Yeah, but that's still fucking impressive.  Yeah.  I grab a car.  I do double nickels.  Double nickels. 
[02:59:30]  The whole way.  That's right.  10 o'clock, 2 o'clock.  You get over to Germany.  You can, uh, you can really put your foot down.  Yeah, yeah.  On the, uh, Autobahn.  Have you done it?  The Autobahn?  You know what?  I've never been on the Autobahn.  I would have loved to have done that.  Because people say it's just insane.  Yeah, it's just an insane experience.  Flat out experience, yeah.  I saw a special on that, and they have all kinds of signals set up for people, because  you're going so fast, you have to know what's up ahead very early on.  So they got these warning lights and signs that tell you that there might be traffic 
[03:00:00]  up ahead, like five miles ahead.  What?  And a truck might be stopped.  Why do they allow that?  Because they're awesome.  It's going to be the party pooper here, but they're awesome over there.  It sounds like it's crazy.  Are there a lot of terrible accidents, like 300 car pileups on the Autobahn?  What a shitty road that is.  I don't want anarchy on a highway.  I want to be the only one that gets to go fast.  Not everyone else.  When I was working in Miami, I was doing a film called Transporter 2, and we had this Lamborghini  Roadster, an LP640. 
[03:00:30]  It was at the time.  It hadn't been released.  And we basically had the cops close off, what was it, sort of three, four miles on this built-up  area in a 30-mile-an-hour limit zone.  Wow.  And they just, like, all the intersections, they just closed them off with the cars.  And we did this rip-roaring sort of one take down through this built-up area.  And I think at the time, I had Pierre Morel, who was actually the guy that directed Taken 
[03:01:00]  at the time, he was just the cameraman.  And he was in the passenger seat, and it was me driving.  And we, I think we hit about a ton 30 in a 30-mile-an-hour limit zone.  It was, we was flying.  Oh, man.  It was a great, great thrill.  Because you get the sensation of the trees and everything flying by.  It's very close to you.  At least everything's closed off, too, so you don't have to worry about someone zipping  through the intersection.  Just hoping all those guys are paying attention, the ones closing off the roads. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Do you see a ton 30?  Yeah.  Oh, I never heard that before.  A hundred and a thousand.  Oh, yeah.  I just never heard a ton 30.  That's kind of cool.  I like that.  Why don't you start using it with your accent, Jimmy?  Ton 30?  Jimmy has an accent that comes out every once in a while.  Especially if Ozzy's here.  When Ozzy's here, he goes into a little thing.  Fantastic.  Who's in the movie with you?  I see...  James Franco.  Right, right.  James Franco's the bad guy.  He's the bad guy.  He plays like...  He's like a meth sort of kingpin. 
[03:02:00]  He's like this drug lord that...  Basically, I'm in this small sort of hillbilly sort of time.  It's supposed to be this picturesque sort of area where I'm taking my daughter to live  for this, you know, riding horses.  Right, it's always the way.  Behind this beauty lurks this, you know, nasty sort of sinister crap that's going on with drugs.  But why do you have to get involved?  Yeah, I was just going to say, why can't you just let him do it?  Why can't you just let him do it? 
[03:02:30]  You ride your horses with your daughter.  Why do you guys always got to get involved?  Well, what happens is, like, that my little daughter gets pushed around by the school bully.  Uh-oh.  And, you know, he's a bit of a big chap.  And she, obviously, being my daughter, has been taught a few things.  She knows how to take care of herself.  She knows how to handle herself.  Yeah.  So, um, she takes care of him in the necessary way.  And then it starts a little bit of a feud from the dad, the parents. 
[03:03:00]  And then it all gets a little bit out of hand.  And they start pushing around her.  Uh-huh.  Now it makes sense.  Wow.  Of course.  Just say, look, I'm sorry my daughter kicked your son's ass.  Right.  Let's go have a few beers and talk this over.  Just want to ride horses and be nice.  Don't need to get the meth kingpin involved.  Exactly.  No need for us to be shooting at each other over a schoolyard tussle.  But cooler heads prevail.  Exactly.  And Winona Ryder's in there.  Winona Ryder's in it. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  She's great.  Kate Bosworth does a terrific job.  She's, um, does a brilliant, uh, performance.  She's, plays this tweaker.  Oh, she's all fucked up.  Yeah, she's all fucked up.  Does that mean she's zooted?  Zooted.  Does that mean she gets high?  Zooted.  She's on the mollies.  Yeah, yeah.  She's on the meth.  Right.  Uh, who else is in it?  Uh, a really great little girl called Isabella, uh, who just blew everybody away with a great  audition.  Uh, Clancy Brown's in it. 
[03:04:00]  Clancy Brown.  He was, did you ever see the Highlander?  Oh, yeah.  He played the Kurgan.  He was, uh...  Oh, man.  I can see that all along.  He's great.  Long-ass time.  Oh, man.  Does, uh, does Franco, James Franco have, uh, minion, uh, henchmen kind of people?  Yes, he's got a couple, yeah.  Kind of, a few, kind of disposable guys.  They get, yeah.  He has got a couple of people that, you know, flicks the muscle for him.  Fly your fist into their faces and whatnot?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  Gotcha.  I like Jason. 
[03:04:30]  I think this is going to end badly for James Franco.  Oh, probably.  I think.  I think this could be a problem in the end for him.  I bet at the end, it's, I bet at the end that James Franco feels guilty and goes to  rehab and gets his life together.  And then Jason kills the horses and insults him for glue, because he now is addicted to meth.  What a horrible movie would be, Jimmy.  How great would that be?  Just twist the whole fucking thing.  It's like, what the fuck is it?  Yeah, you see the car driving away with, like, happy music playing and a horse horse being  thrown out the window for no reason. 
[03:05:00]  An awful ending.  Yeah, just some barbaric, terrible ending.  It sounds great, man.  I love, uh, Jason's movies.  They're just so, uh, so much fun, action-packed, and, uh, I love the weapon.  Henry and whatnot.  We get a few, a few, a little gunplay in this?  Uh, it is a little gunplay, yeah.  A little gunplay?  A bit of an old shotgun.  I like that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe some knife play?  A little knife play?  There is no knife play in this one, no.  I like a little knife play. 
[03:05:30]  I improvise with some, like, someone gets whacked around the head with a car battery.  Oh, right.  Okay, there you go.  There you go.  Oh, that would hurt.  You need, you need that one.  What about the nipple play, though?  Is there any...  I like some good nipple play.  That's creepy.  David enjoys a little nipple play.  I do.  I really creep people out when I say I like nip play.  When you abbreviate nipple, that really disturbs people.  No one wants...  Speaking of tweaking.  But it's funny.  You're always looking for the right prop to hit someone with, as it's been used before,  you know?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:06:00]  We had, what's his name?  Guillermo...  Guillermo del Toro.  Del Toro on the other day.  What an interesting fella, man.  Wow.  And he directed Pacific Rim, and I thought it was great.  I was like, it was one of those old school kind of monster movie feel to it.  And at one point when the robot guy's just going through the street trying to get the monster,  he's dragging a ship behind him.  He's just dragging a ship, and he picks it up like a bat and hits the monster.  It's like, he's beating...  They wrote in where this guy beats another guy with a ship. 
[03:06:30]  That's fucking awesome.  That's cool.  Yeah, yeah.  That's great.  So a car battery is a great weapon.  Doesn't have the same ring to it, does it?  Really?  You just downplayed his fucking battery.  You're not quite as tall as the robots.  That's a rooted market.  I took away your thunder.  This is a good get.  No, you gotta bring some different stuff.  You gotta have a bag with weird shit in it, like a fight breaks out.  You pull out a slide whistle and a dildo, and you fucking club somebody with it.  It'd still be great to watch somebody being struck.  I would actually like watching that, sure. 
[03:07:00]  What's the next movie?  What's the next movie?  I'm right in the middle of shooting Fast and the Furious Part 7.  I just recently finished Expendables 3 with Sly, and they've got a good cast this time.  Yeah.  I mean...  Who's different in the cast?  They've got Harrison Ford.  Oh, right.  That's right.  Mel Gibson.  Wesley Snipes.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  It's funny, because we break Wesley out of prison.  Oh, well, that's kind of... 
[03:07:30]  At the beginning of the movie, a couple of the lads were in the plane, and they go,  So, why were you in prison?  He says, tax evasion.  It was quite funny.  That's awesome.  Yeah, they put it in a film.  And, of course, Bruce Will...  Oh, that's right.  He's not in this one.  No.  I don't think...  Who else did you go?  Wesley Snipes.  He's so good.  I love it.  He's so good.  Gerard Depardieu, he's like a really weird addition to the...  Have you ever seen anyone do an impression of you? 
[03:08:00]  Uh, no.  My friend doesn't.  You know, Godfrey, the black comic.  He doesn't.  He's a great mimic, and he does an amazing Jason Statham.  Wow, I've never seen him do that.  No one does Jason Statham.  I don't know if you knew anybody who did it.  We should have him on the phone.  To do it.  It doesn't necessarily help the conversation, but I just figured I would mention it.  He told us ahead of time.  We could have him on the phone.  He does it.  Jason's like, wow, that's pretty good.  Or Jason criticizes it.  Right.  It's awful.  He never does it again.  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  He never performs again because he's degraded.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  He's in poverty.  What do you mean he has to go?  I don't talk to myself.  Someone fucking...  Oh, Iraq?  ...throws shit in my ear sometimes.  He's very busy.  You're very busy, Jason.  Yeah, Jason's now looking at you like, what the fuck?  Where are you getting your info from?  From Roland.  Oh.  Saying that he has other interviews he has to do.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Is that it?  Oh.  I don't know.  What other interviews?  I think we covered it, though.  I think we did pretty good here.  That's...  That's cars. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  Where are you going?  Car battery.  Car battery fight.  Fucking nipple play.  Good actors.  Nipple play.  Nipple play.  Got the dirt on Bruce Willis.  I think we did good here today.  He dug deep.  He spoke volumes with his silence.  Right.  Yeah.  He was out.  Oh, God.  Okay.  So, Homefront, it opens November 27th.  Now we're a couple weeks out.  2013, of course.  Three weeks out, right?  That's fantastic, man.  I love this.  Phil Broker.  Phil Broker. 
[03:09:30]  That's you.  I'm Phil Broker.  Low-level DEA agent.  You're going to be kicking some ass in this one.  There's a great sly line.  What does he say?  He goes, whatever you're thinking, rethink it.  You know what?  No one can deliver that better than sly, but, you know, I tried.  You give it your best shot.  I'm sure it's...  It's probably slow and methodically probably like you did, you know, whatever you think.  I can't do a line like that.  I would...  I would...  Yeah, I can imagine I'm doing that.  I would say, whatever you're thinking, rethink.  Dank it.  That's good delivery there. 
[03:10:00]  Menacing.  I'm not buying into the whole winging it thing anymore.  The what?  The winging it.  You keep saying you wing it as an actor to a certain degree.  I don't buy that anymore.  What do you mean?  You have too many hits under your belt.  It says, I'm still winging it now to a certain degree.  I'm not the sort of actor who spent hours in drama school or with an acting teacher or anything  like that.  You're not winging it anymore.  You're damn good.  I mean, it's...  You're damn good, sir.  You just, you know, you just get in there and you just, you know...  Wing it.  Wing it. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, let's have it.  Let's have it right.  Wing it.  Turn up, say these fucking words.  Exactly.  You know, because I, it's funny, it takes me back to meeting Guy Ritchie and I had no  experience again at that time and he was making this film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  I love that one.  And he says, listen, I did the audition and I pleased all the, you know, the sceptical  producers and the, you know, the casting directors that wanted all these thespians from fucking 
[03:11:00]  RADA and so all these people that didn't want me, Guy was the one who fought for me.  And I said, okay, Guy, you give me the part.  Thanks very much.  So, obviously, I better start learning how to act.  So, shall I go and get a few lessons?  He went, no, you silly prat.  Just turn up and say the fucking words.  Turn up and say the words.  That was it.  Fucking words.  I love it.  You don't need any.  That stuff's no good to you. 
[03:11:30]  You just...  Because you don't want to be too polished.  You'll probably overthink it, right?  Through every actor that's...  That was probably appropriate for his movie.  I just applied that same technique to everything I've ever done, which is probably not the  smartest thing.  That's why Jason's not playing Macbeth.  Correct.  Now, it's still hard to do.  It's really...  It's not easy just to turn up and say the fucking word.  You look natural.  Believe me, it's a lot harder than it looks.  And you found the formula, man.  Why fucking...  Yeah.  You know, why fucking mess with that? 
[03:12:00]  What the hell?  Who's this?  All right.  I guess we're here tomorrow.  I have my advice show coming up next.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  Jim Norton continues today.  Advice.  Yeah.  I give really good advice.  You got a question?  You look an agony aunt.  Yeah.  An agony aunt.  That's what we call them.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, an Ann Landers or something.  Yeah.  My favorite...  He has insulted you.  No, but he's not wrong.  He's not wrong.  We'll do the best you can.  I'm sure you're trying.  An agony aunt.  Yeah, I'm an agony aunt. 
[03:12:30]  I gotta remember that.  That's hilarious.  Jason, you got a question?  Because Jimmy couldn't fucking work with you here.  You got any advice you need?  Well, any help?  Any help, anything.  I'm very good.  What do you got?  Give us a question.  Personal issues.  Sure.  I'm good with relationships.  Sexual issues.  Any type of addiction.  Sexual behavior.  Addiction.  Drugs.  Alcohol.  He's a big fan of the cuckold thing.  Yeah, I'm very good about it.  What kind of punts is calling?  What's that?  What kind of people are calling in?  Oh, the best people.  Good people.  People in need.  Do you select your victims? 
[03:13:00]  No, no, no.  Whoever wants to call and ask a question, I answer it.  It's a lot of...  See how genuine I am?  Yeah, it's a lot of different subjects.  But you'll get people that will say,  I have this urge to watch my wife having sex with another man.  How can I make that happen?  That's right.  And then you'll get other ones where, you know, the guy's on drugs and he tries to hook  them together.  You've got the drug guy with the wife.  Absolutely.  And I take them in order of big tit size.  That's how to ask your question. 
[03:13:30]  So stay tuned for E-Rock to call first.  Oh, wow.  I'm kidding, E-Rock.  We haven't even said anything about you.  Jason's movie is called...  It is Homefront and it is out on November the 27th.  Yes.  And, you know, Jason's just an animal.  Jason's great.  Jason's a lot of fun having the show.  Thanks again for coming in.  Good luck on the rest of your interviews for your day.  Thank you, gents.  They're not going to be as good as this one.  You know that.  That'll be awful.  Just deal with it.  You'll get through it.  Relax.  You'll be all right.  Good so-gents, yeah.  Absolutely, man.  Thanks again.  Make sure Sabian knows we did seven extra minutes today.

My first advice show in a couple of weeks due to traveling, and I'm blowing my nose like a fucking coke addict.  I will be making up the ones I missed, too.  So I appreciate those of you that listen and give a shit. 
[03:15:30]  I'm very tired.  I came back from L.A. on the red eye.  Just had a very, very uneventful trip.  Except for the Leno.  I was happy with the Leno segment.  But, you know, I was supposed to have a meeting, and it got fucking just blown off last minute.  You know, all this shit that happens is just, it's as frustrating in my business as it is in any of yours, you know.  And I love what I do.  I'm very lucky, and it's very easy compared to what a lot of you do, physically at least.  You know, I don't have to break my back or drive a forklift or any of the crap which I've done. 
[03:16:00]  So, whatever, I'm not going to bitch too much.  But a couple of quick upcoming dates.  I'm going to whore myself.  15th and 16th of this month, I will be at Albany at the Comedy Works.  I never draw crowds there, so come on out.  Plenty of seats probably available.  November 22-23, Clinton, New Jersey, the Garden State Comedy Club.  And Friday and Sunday, December 27 and 29, and in Las Vegas at the Hard Rock.  It's one show each night. 
[03:16:30]  Tickets go on sale Friday.  And in San Diego for New Year's Eve, the American Comedy Club.  Tickets on sale Friday.  Okay, let's go with Ed in Philly.  How's it going?  Hi, buddy.  Hey, I've got about 60 days sobriety right now.  That's great, man.  And, Bella, thank you.  Thank you.  It's been wonderful.  And, Ben, thanks for just being out there and being a voice, you know, for sobriety.  My libido has gone, been shot to hell. 
[03:17:00]  It's total shit.  My wife is starting to get self-conscious about it.  I mean, I'm still sexual with her, but I'm just not even feeling it.  You're going through a major change, first of all.  Don't, you know, when I first got sober, I remember I said to my sponsor at the time,  will I ever be able to laugh again?  Because I used to do mescaline and laugh, and I didn't think I'd be able to laugh.  If you're going through a major change right now, so give yourself time, all that stuff  will balance out, believe me.  Yeah, I know.  It's nice to be able to finally sleep, but everything else is just like, everything's 
[03:17:30]  going great except that area.  And it's really starting to screw me up.  It's like, mentally, I'm getting, I guess I'm getting a little fixated on it.  You know, when I was drinking, I was sexually very impulsive and compulsive.  Yeah.  When I'm not drinking, the thought doesn't even enter my head.  You know, it's just like, man, what, what, doesn't even seem appealing?  You know, and it's just, yeah, it is a bit of a head fuck, so, but thanks, Jimmy.  I'm trying to hang on to it. 
[03:18:00]  Yes, you'll be okay, Ed, don't get caught up in your head, your body's going through  a major change, your psyche's going through a big change.  Give yourself time to get a little, it'll be a little screwy for a little while, it's  okay.  Your libido will come back, believe me.  Your mind is just fucking all over the place right now, so you're coming out of an abusive  relationship with yourself, so give yourself a little time, all right?  Okay, one last question.  Any advice on how I could explain this to the wife to where she's not taking it personally,  because at this point it's starting to affect her.  Well, sit down with her and tell her what I just told you. 
[03:18:30]  I'm coming out of a major, I'm making a major life change.  I'm all over the place.  It has nothing to do with you.  No, okay.  Well, thank you, Jimmy.  You have a great one.  Bye, buddy.  Eric in New York, I'm depressed with the thoughts of death and people dying all around me.  I thought that was Iraq.  Yes, Eric.  Hey, Jimmy.  I'm 19 years old, and it just really freaking bothers me that people just die around me,  and, like, I just feel dead myself.  I get this depressing every day.  Well, why are you caught up in it?  It's amazing, and I have certain doubts of that, but when you think about it, 
[03:19:00]  death is the absolute guarantee for every person.  It really is a big part of our existence.  Why are you allowing yourself to be bogged down in thoughts of it?  I'm only 19 years old.  I've had two friends my age, one suicide recently, and another one in a car accident,  and I was wondering how you feel, how you take that, because I know you've had a lot of friends pass away.  And I've had a lot kill themselves.  I think I know at least six or seven people have committed suicide, maybe more, counting sober people, 
[03:19:30]  and the way you handle it is you grieve.  You know, it never gets easy, but the process becomes more familiar.  Like, Patrice's death was extraordinarily difficult.  That was probably the hardest I've ever dealt with.  But I know the process.  I understand the crying and the grief, and, you know, just go through it.  Let yourself go through it.  But you don't get bogged down and obsessed with it when things aren't bad.  Because eventually, you know, as my mother used to say, we all go bye-bye in the box. 
[03:20:00]  You'll be there in less than 100 years.  We're here for a blip of time, so I try not to get too, too caught up in the fact that other people are dying.  And you know what?  As shitty as it sounds, better them than you.  Better them than you.  Like, I think when George Harrison died, or when Roy Orbison died,  I forget who it was.  It might have been Tom Petty that tells the story.  That when Roy Orbison died, George Harrison called him and said,  Aren't you glad it ain't you?  Like, as much as it sucks when people we care about die, better them than me. 
[03:20:30]  So, you know, you outlived another one.  Be grateful for that.  Okay.  Thank you so much.  All right.  Enjoy life, dude.  I should take my own advice.  Okay.  Let's, Bill in Boston.  Fiance's last boyfriend was a hung black guy, and you feel insecure.  Hi, Bill.  Hey, Jimmy.  Big fan.  Big fan.  Thank you.  So, yeah, I just got engaged to this awesome girl, best girl I've ever met in my life.  Um, but I was, uh, looking through some of her pictures, and, uh, just realized that, 
[03:21:00]  uh, her last boyfriend before me was, uh, a very big black man, and, um, kind of noticed  that, like, uh, you know, when we first started going out, she had a bunch of, uh, Magnum  condom in her drawer.  So, yeah, I guess I kind of pieced everything together, and, uh, just feeling a little bit  insecure about it.  I mean, I know I kind of satisfy her, but, yeah, just feeling a little inadequate about it.  Just wondering, uh, give me some advice on how to deal with it.  Well, I'm a pervert, so I can enjoy that, but I, I also understand the insecurity of 
[03:21:30]  that, because I went through it so many times.  Uh, she's obviously, if she wanted his large black dick, she'd be with him, or another black  guy with a big dick.  Whatever it is that you're giving her is what she wants.  Um, women like size to a certain degree, but men are much more obsessed with the idea  of that than women are.  It's almost like if you were dating somebody, how big are her breasts?  What size tits does she have?  Uh, she doesn't have that big tits.  Uh, they're a pretty normal-sized handful.  Okay, so say they're like B-cups. 
[03:22:00]  That would be like saying that you, if you had someone with D-cups, she, her going, he's  going to be much happier with someone with D-cups.  You might go like, nah, they were okay, but who cares?  That's the way a lot of times women feel about dicks, so if she really, really wanted to be  with that guy, she'd be with him.  Or if she wanted to fuck someone like him, that's what she'd be doing.  But if she's your fiancé, that means she wants to commit to you.  So, she's not being forced to.  Well, I am kind of flipping around.  What's that?  Oh, all right, well.  Yeah.  I would suggest learning how to make it dirty and enjoying it. 
[03:22:30]  But, if you can't do that, then just realize she's with you for a reason.  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Hey, thanks a lot, Jimmy.  I appreciate it.  All right, good luck, you lucky duck.  Bill in Boston.  Uh, David in New Jersey has a follow-up on his past sleep issues.  Yes, David.  Hi, good morning, Jimmy.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Well, we spoke maybe two, three months ago about my sleeping issues.  I was waking up randomly in the middle of the night, and you mentioned adrenaline.  Okay.  I am a diabetic, and I wasn't really watching my sugar too well. 
[03:23:00]  Okay.  I recently got a device, and I've been watching it more and more, and I've been noticing  that the nights that I would wake up randomly in the middle of the night and watch my monitor,  I would notice that the sugar would peak in the middle of the night in a certain condition.  I don't remember the name of it, but it, um...  Sugar peak.  Anyway, basically, in the middle of the night, the liver basically thinks that, oh, you don't  have enough sugar, and it starts just being like an idiot and generating more sugar.  Okay.  And when I noticed I was more on top of my meds, and I was taking care of myself, and 
[03:23:30]  I was making sure to do all my injections and everything else, that throughout the night  the levels would stay normal, and I felt a lot more rested.  So for anybody else who has problems, they may want to check out the sugar, and that  could possibly be it.  But since I've been taking my meds properly and not feeling stupid and sorry for myself  and not eating shit and candy and stuff like that, I've been sleeping better and feeling  a lot better.  So...  That's great to hear, buddy.  Thank you for the call.  I appreciate it.  I went for my sleep test.  I'm supposed to talk to the insurance, the home care people today, because I did test for 
[03:24:00]  a complex apnea.  I have it, as I knew I did, and the ASV machine was helpful.  It was extraordinarily uncomfortable, and I got a prescription for Ambien.  I wanted one Ambien, because they hook you up with wires, and I'm very ultra careful with  medication.  So she wrote me a prescription for 30 Ambien.  Did I tell the story on the advice show?  I don't think I did.  Yeah, I think you told it on O&A. 
[03:24:30]  30 Ambien, and as soon as I got home, I dumped 29 in the toilet, and I shit on them, because  they wouldn't...  They would get stuck to the bottom of the toilet.  They wouldn't go down.  So I took a heaping dump on them, and then finally knocked them off.  And I only took a half of the Ambien, and I was able to sleep.  So I will be hopefully talking to these people today and get a mask...  I mean, a machine that works sometime in the next week or 10 days.  So very frustrating.  And to the guy, Joe in Philly, I'm not going to take your call.  I'm not mad at you, but you're asking how active I am. 
[03:25:00]  In a certain 12-step program.  I don't mention programs by name on the air.  I will say this.  I'm not nearly as active as I should be.  I used to be extraordinarily active.  Constantly going to meetings and constantly doing the right thing.  But I'm much less than I should be.  However, I do still go.  Can I ask you a question real quick about your painkillers and stuff?  Sure.  If you're one of those people who had that kind of addiction to any kind of drug, and you  have to take it for a medical reason, how do you justify that as far as being sober? 
[03:25:30]  Well, my sponsor always drilled into me that motives are everything.  Now, Ronnie B, from what I hear, didn't take pain medication for his...  That's what I was going to bring up, yeah.  Because for him, he didn't feel he could handle it or he didn't trust it.  And that's okay.  I respect his ability to do that.  I am not cocky about it.  But when I've had surgeries, or again, I knew why I was doing this.  I had zero desire to get high.  I wasn't tricking myself.  I didn't stockpile the medication.  I dumped it immediately. 
[03:26:00]  And then there was that one little addict thought in me, though, that when I came home,  I'm like, well, they gave you 30.  You should save one just in case this started.  I'm like, no.  Get another prescription if it doesn't work.  So you have to be ultra careful, and you have to be absolutely pure in your motives.  I knew what they were.  I'm an insomniac.  I don't sleep.  If I don't get my test results, I have to sleep for them to give me results.  This was not even about being comfortable.  This was about getting a machine titrated so I can fucking get my life together, 
[03:26:30]  because I'm fucking ready to blow my brains out with this fucking apnea.  So if you know what your motives are, sometimes people have somebody give them the medication.  Sometimes you just, you know, like, again, I will give myself less than the recommended dosage.  If they say take one pill every four hours, I'll take one every six hours, and then a half every six hours.  And I always throw them out before I'm done.  I'm ultra careful and respectful of that, because pills were never my thing, but immediately they could become my thing. 
[03:27:00]  So it's not viewed as violating your sobriety?  No, nothing's about drinking or doing a drug.  I've had sips of alcohol since I'm sober by mistake.  In a bar, once I took a sip, it was gin.  It was my own Coke.  I work in clubs.  Spit it out.  My motives were not to pick up a drink.  My motive was not to drink.  I wasn't trying to sneak it in.  And you have to be really careful with that, because you can't lie to yourself and go,  Oh, my head hurts.  Let me take this pill if my motives are good.  Because you're lying.  Your motives are not good. 
[03:27:30]  I don't fuck with that stuff unless it's absolutely, you know, again, when I had my fucking sinuses and I just sit sleeping up for four days because I had major surgery in my sinuses, I can't go without pain.  I'm not a martyr.  I didn't get sober to sit there and fucking have, like, a nail driven into my forehead.  But I knew why I was doing it.  So, no, it's not as considered a slip if your motives are for real.  You know, but again, usually you talk to people.  You check that out with people. 
[03:28:00]  You know, doctors don't know.  You can't always listen to your doctor because they don't always know about addiction.  Like, my therapist does not know everything about it.  She'll be like, can't you take this?  So, it's funny.  Somebody told me about a sleeping aid.  So, I talked to somebody else in the program.  They're like, ah, for guys like us, we shouldn't take it.  I'm like, okay, I won't take it.  That's why I don't take this stuff.  Let's see here.  Rick in Ohio wants to ask if I was close to falling off the wagon.  That's how I dealt with it.  Rick?  Yeah, I was just wondering if there's any instance where you were really, really close to having a drink and if you had to talk to somebody about it or how you handled that. 
[03:28:30]  I've had those times in my sobriety where I wanted to pick up.  But you call somebody or you go to whatever meeting it is you go to.  But my mind doesn't necessarily work like that anymore.  It's trickier for me now.  It says things like, ah, you don't need to talk to people.  Just isolate or just eat or blow your brains out.  My mind talks to me in very weird ways now. 
[03:29:00]  So, a lot of times the way I deal with it is I sit in it and I wallow in it and I become more miserable.  When I'm being smart, I talk to people and I do the right thing or I go to whatever kind of meeting it is that I would go to for something like that.  And, you know, talking about it helps a lot.  But sometimes you don't know how close you are until you're drinking.  You know, that's why we have to be always vigilant about it.  All right, buddy?  All right, bud.  Take care.  Oh, God. 
[03:29:30]  Greg in Florida.  Yes.  Hi, Jim.  Good morning.  How are you?  Good, buddy.  Please don't throw pills in the toilet.  It's bad for the environment.  You know what?  I heard that from someone else once.  The environment will have to take the hit on this one.  Because you know what else is bad for the environment?  Me relapsing and then plowing into you on the fucking road.  That's bad for the environment, too.  Yeah, well, I agree with that.  But, yeah, if you could just put it in a coffee can, put some water in it, and then tape it up and put it in the regular garbage. 
[03:30:00]  It's better for the environment.  All right.  Well, that's terrific.  But in that moment, I only thought, get rid of this shit because I don't trust myself.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, of course.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Get rid of that shit.  Yeah, don't hold on to it.  But, yeah, they're just finding that there's just antibiotics and everything in the environment because of people flushing it down the toilet.  I very rarely do that.  I very rarely do that.  But thanks for the call.  I appreciate it.  All right.  Let's see here. 
[03:30:30]  Wes in Mississippi about his addiction.  Yes, Wes.  Hey, what's up, Jimmy?  Hey, man.  Man, it's so cool to talk to you, dude.  Thank you.  Me and my wife drove seven hours to see you in Dallas a couple years ago, and I was such a nervous Nelly.  I couldn't even come up and talk to you and give anything signed or anything.  Well, thank you, Wes.  I'm a delight and a darling you could have.  I know.  And you think you're not famous, but to us that are of the same ilk as you, you mean a lot to us, brother. 
[03:31:00]  Well, thank you, Wes.  That's really nice.  But, man, I got on, you know, Jesus Christ, I'm stuttering.  Panicking, Wes.  Yeah, I know.  It was innocent enough.  I had a neck injury, and then right after that had dental surgery, and it just kind of went from there.  And I got on oxycodone, and for several years there, it was – I never shot up heroin or any of that, but I was doing the same things. 
[03:31:30]  I was stealing from friends, you know, stealing from work, just whatever I had to do to get the money to get that.  And I think people – there's got to be something we can do to bring this more to the forefront.  I don't know if it's doctors or what, but they've got to – you know, look, this shit is just as dangerous as heroin or whatever, crack. 
[03:32:00]  You know, once you get on it, it is – and the worst part, the worst part for me was after I got off of it was shitting water for about two weeks.  It was terrible.  Well, Wes, I think the way to get a handle on it is a couple things.  People have to only get the medication when they really need it, and doctors have to stop writing it for anyone who just asks for it. 
[03:32:30]  Yeah.  I think it's a two-pronged issue, you know.  The medication, a lot of it is very, very addictive.  And again, be sure of your motives, like really sure of your motives when you take something like that.  Be very, very respectful of it and very careful of it.  But there's no one blanket way to do it.  Again, they do say this stuff.  That's why we need a prescription.  You can't just go and buy it.  It's a prescription.  Right, right.  For most of it or a lot of this stuff.  So, you know, again, it's an individual issue and responsibility thing, and the doctor's got to stop writing all these fucking prescriptions for people. 
[03:33:00]  All right, buddy?  Okay, man.  Thanks, brother.  Bye, Wes.  Now, this guy, Dan, had a prescription for Ambien and it fucked him.  I fucked with him.  Hey, Dan.  Jimmy.  Hi, buddy.  Hey, how you doing, man?  Good, thank you.  I had a, I'm a, I'm a Marine Corps veteran.  I did two war tours.  I got PTSD.  Okay.  Part of it is sleep.  I don't sleep or shit.  Yeah, me neither.  And, uh, the doctor at the VA, I'm also, now I'm a recovering alcoholic. 
[03:33:30]  I've been sober, uh, almost seven, you know, 16 months.  Oh, great.  But I was still drinking when, uh, I got this and all my files to the VA, you know, it said to the doctor, you know, drinks and they had like my whole history.  And she gave me, uh, and she gave me, uh, Ambien.  And, man, that stuff is, I, like, I would fall asleep, get up and drive and not even know it.  I'd, like, wake up, my car would be sideways.  Sure.  I'd cook, I'd cook food and fall asleep and the oven on.  Yeah, I've heard it's a real, like, phone calls and shit people make when they're on Ambien. 
[03:34:00]  It's a real nightmare.  Yeah, but there are good, uh, the doctor I have now at the VA, she, uh, before I knew it, who would have thought she, uh, cited an addictive personality.  Right.  And I'm on a sleep-to-med now that's non-narcotic.  And it, I mean, it works, I still don't sleep that great, but it works real good.  What are you on?  It's, uh, Trazodone.  Oh, see, that's the one I heard.  And I heard that for, uh, people in recovery can be a rough one.  No, I, you know, I've, I had no issues with it. 
[03:34:30]  I know it's, uh, like I said, it's a non-narcotic, so that's why she prescribed it to me.  Is it a sleep pill or is it for depression and one of the side effects of sleep?  Correct.  And it's, it's mostly used for depression, but it does help in cases with sleep.  And so far it's working.  But that's, you know, just a thought.  And, yeah.  I saw you, I saw you when you came to Cleveland, when you take your show, man.  It was great.  Thank you, Dan.  Thank you for the call.  I appreciate it, buddy.  Take care.  Be good, buddy. 
[03:35:00]  John in Florida, Food Addiction.  Hello, John.  Um, my question would be, normally, uh, I just can't go, like, throughout certain days  without thinking of certain foods.  Like, I always want to have candy or something like that.  Yeah.  And I try to just stay off it.  And I can do it for, like, two or three months, but it constantly comes back.  I have no idea.  Maybe it's mental.  Well, no, food is very hard.  Yeah.  How did you lose the weight?  I mean, I do regular exercise as it is, so.  Well, you lose the weight.  You can only do it today. 
[03:35:30]  And anything you do, you can only do today.  So what happens is, if you look at it like, I'm not going to eat this stuff forever, it's  a really overwhelming thing.  But on any given day, you cannot eat poorly.  Um, you know what I mean?  So sometimes, like, with food, like, with anything else, you have to take an hour at a time or  a day at a time.  And, uh, you know, I would suggest, again, there's 12-step programs with food, which are  supposed to be very good.  It's a really hard one.  I think it's the hardest because you have to eat to stay alive.  So, um, I would suggest that. 
[03:36:00]  12-step program with food, you mixed in with exercise or whatever, um, you know, might  be what you need.  I, I, and for me, I will occasionally eat what I shouldn't.  I had a couple of bad, like, average eating days, not particularly great.  But, um, you know, I was in the gym four or five times last week with trainers, so I  would suggest that, too.  All right.  Thank you so much.  Big fan, by the way.  All right.  Thank you, man.  Good luck.  Food addiction is very hard.  Uh, let's see, uh, John in California, no trust in people and a self-destructive personality. 
[03:36:30]  How do you fix it?  Hi, John.  Hey, Jimmy.  Nice talking with you, man.  You too, buddy.  Um, yeah.  Um, I don't know where to even start, you know?  Go back to childhood and terror and living life, and then you talk about the 12-step programs  and talking with people and, you know, psychologists and things like that.  Like, I don't, I have a hard time trusting those people, and then I'm also a train wreck.  You know, I'm 51 years old, I'm 6 foot, 175 pounds, I'm walking a piece of fucking meat, 
[03:37:00]  just going bananas on life.  And I know this is not the answer.  This is not the way to fucking roll.  Well, why don't you, hold on.  Let me ask you a question.  Why don't you trust people?  What are you worried they're going to do?  Um, that's a good question.  Um, well, I just, their advice, maybe.  Or, or the scenario involved.  Um, you know, I just, it's a trust factor. 
[03:37:30]  You know, what do I think they're going to do?  I really don't know, I guess.  Is there anything wrong with you medically?  Like, are you paranoid or anything like that?  Um, well, I, I, maybe, I don't know.  Um, it's just one of those positions where, you know, I'm trying to figure it out myself,  and obviously I'm not on the right path.  Okay, well, sometimes, I mean, I'm sorry, let me tell you that.  Sometimes what you got to do, if you're having these things and you're not sure what it is,  get tested or see a psychologist or a therapist or whatever, 
[03:38:00]  and make sure that you're not medically, like, you know, paranoid or schizophrenic.  I'm not saying you sound crazy, but, you know, you're saying you're a personality disorder, basically.  You don't trust people, and you're self-destructive.  So, maybe some therapy would help you.  All right, well, yeah, well, good, now I got to trust a therapist.  But, well, yeah, what's a therapist is legally bound to not tell people?  Well, I'm not going to tell anybody.  I can give a shit about that.  It's just, I don't trust that motherfucker.  Giving me the advice, medication, I don't know what they fucking want to do. 
[03:38:30]  What do you think they want to do?  Use your common sense.  Well, I think they want to collect a paycheck, is what I think.  I don't think they're really on my side and really want to fucking help me.  Why not?  They collect a paycheck.  But do you think that everybody who does something like that is just about the money?  There's a lot better ways they could probably make money.  I think they get a degree and they're sitting in an office and you're paying your insurance and you, you know, go to Kaiser or whatever the fuck and you go see a therapist. 
[03:39:00]  And it's just, it's just, I don't think they want to prescribe medication.  In some cases, you may be right.  I'm sure you're right.  But in other cases, you're not right.  There's people who do want to help you and they do want to see if they can get to the bottom of whatever your problem is.  Just kind of keep searching for a good therapist?  Yeah, or just realize, so the worst that can happen.  So what if you trust someone who's not a great therapist?  Think about it.  They can't tell people. 
[03:39:30]  So what's the big deal?  Like, take the risk.  The reward will be great and the loss is very low.  Who gives a fuck if they're not trustworthy?  You go to someone else.  Yeah, I was, they wanted to give you some medication, you know, depression medication.  But I don't know, I don't want to take stuff.  I don't want to be on pills.  I drink, you know, I may ask my, my, my release, you know.  How much do you drink?  I'll pint every day.  So you think you might have a problem with alcohol? 
[03:40:00]  I have a problem with life.  No, no, no.  But I'm asking you about alcohol.  Alcohol is a substance.  Life is a vague idea.  Life is a vague, you know, ungraspable thing.  Alcohol is a very real, graspable, picturable thing.  So.  Yeah, I would say, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's my release, and yes, I would say absolutely.  Okay.  That's what I do to survive.  So why are you thinking that maybe you shouldn't quit drinking? 
[03:40:30]  I've been to rehab.  You know, and quitting drinking probably would be a first step to start to maybe move forward.  So then you know the answer.  Maybe I do, yeah.  But you don't like the answer, because quitting drinking is scary or it's depressing, so you're  trying to find a way around the answer.  And when you already know the...  Well, I've done it.  I've quit drinking for years. 
[03:41:00]  Okay.  Were you recovering when you quit drinking?  Were you going to meetings?  Were you talking to people?  Were you helping people and being helped?  Um, well, that's a trust factor.  Yeah, I went to the 12th step.  I've been through the meetings.  I've been sober for over five years.  Okay.  Six years.  Okay.  But then, but the realization of life just doesn't seem fucking realistic, so I'm falling  off, you know?  Where's the next step to this wonderful world we're supposed to live in? 
[03:41:30]  I don't know.  Go back to the meetings, and whatever it is you missed early on, you'll get, or try to  get, because obviously you missed something, as they say, your foundation was weak and the  house collapsed.  Next, go, I would say, that would be my suggestion, to go back and address the drinking first and  foremost.  All right.  Okay.  That's cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And someone is saying that you need to be tested for being bipolar.  Maybe you do.  Have you been tested for being bipolar?  Uh, no. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't have a trust factor enough to deal with the people.  I just don't trust anybody.  I understand, John, but you've got to realize, and this is not an insult, but you're not important  enough for all of us to trick.  Like, think of it.  Yeah, I agree.  You know, like, you know that intellectually, so sometimes know that you don't trust somebody,  but act as if.  Just go through the process.  Because now you're just giving yourself an excuse to sit on your ass and do nothing.  I don't trust anyone.  Therefore, I can't get better. 
[03:42:30]  True.  It's an excuse to stay sick.  Like, so, even if you don't trust someone, open up to them and talk to them, because  realize they can't tell anyone, so you're losing nothing.  If they tell, I don't really give a shit.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  There's nothing to lose.  Yeah.  I live my life.  You know, make money.  That's all I gotta do.  Make money in this fucking world, and that's all it's about.  Making fucking money.  No, it's about being happy, too.  It's not just about making money, John.  It's part of it, but that's not all of it.  Well, you can't be happier without money. 
[03:43:00]  No, I agree.  It's very hard.  Making money is a bare necessity, but making money at the cost of all integrity does not  like, you know, you're saying they're all just there to pay up a check, but no, some  of them really do care.  Yeah.  All right?  Find some new photos.  Yeah.  That's cool.  Keep your search up.  Don't give up.  All right.  I'll get back to you, Jimmy.  Thanks.  I appreciate it.  Good luck, John.  And stop drinking.  Goodbye, buddy.  All right.  Let's see here.  So, as we said, the bipolar thing.  John in New Jersey, is Let's Take It Slow or a precursor to the end of a relationship? 
[03:43:30]  John?  Yeah.  Hey, Jimmy.  Thanks for taking my call.  Sure.  How long are you with the girl?  Short.  Maybe three months.  Three months.  Wow.  And she wants to take it slower?  How far has it gone?  I mean, not that far, but we got wrapped up in a whirlwind.  I mean, and I'm the type of guy that falls in love quick.  I know that about myself.  Yeah, a bit of a love addict, are you?  Yeah, you know.  But, you know, she hit me with this, let's take things slower, you know, and I just don't... 
[03:44:00]  To me, that sounds like, you know, it's over.  Fuck you.  Well, yeah, but a lot of times, somebody in the first three months doesn't want to rush  into marriage or a heavy relationship.  I think that's fair.  All right.  So, why don't you just see where it goes?  It's hard to say after three months.  It's really hard to say.  No, and I get that.  I'm not saying, you know, let's, you know, move in tomorrow and get married, you know, 
[03:44:30]  on Friday or anything like that, but, you know, we do talk about things, and, you know,  I get it.  I get it.  Okay.  Well, sorry.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Don't be sorry.  Thanks for the call, man.  Thank you, buddy.  That's all right.  J and PA, your fiance wants you to convert to Islam and you're agnostic.  Hello?  Yay, Jimmy.  How you doing?  Hey.  We got a huge fan playing Lex with PA a few weeks ago. 
[03:45:00]  Thank you.  The situation I'm in, my fiance and I, you know, love her to death.  She's great.  Been together a while, but she comes from a Muslim background.  She does the bare minimum.  She does Ramadan, but, you know, we have good times on the weekend.  She, you know, she's very laid back in that sense.  Not even brought up 99.9% of the time.  You wouldn't even know.  But her father is very, you know, culturally, you know, with Islam.  She wants me to, you know, we're getting married in June.  She wants me to convert to Islam, see a shape. 
[03:45:30]  And just, you know, say a couple sentences.  She, like, waters it down.  I don't know if I'm, like, and she says, Dad will bless the marriage that way.  I'm wondering if I should do it.  And just whatever makes her happy.  Or am I setting myself up down the road?  And I have friends that, you know, are very, I'm very agnostic.  I have friends that have had Catholic weddings that I know don't care.  So I just, like, it's just the Islam thing just has that negative stigma, you know.  But I don't know why you should have to.  I think she should accept who you are. 
[03:46:00]  I've got a real dislike of this whole convert shit if you want to get married.  You should go in as you are and she should go in as she is.  If you both mutually respect each other, then you'll have that.  If you have kids, you'll have to make a decision.  Personally, I would absolutely not do it.  If she's that, if she's an adult.  So instead of, you know, going to some fantasy book and you're pretending you believe it's utter nonsense.  All of it.  So why not just be true to yourself?  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:46:30]  And that's kind of how I feel.  I just didn't know, you know, if it doesn't mean much just to make that.  Because she wants Dad to bless the marriage.  That's her big thing.  Well, how about Dad blesses the marriage because you're a good guy?  Exactly.  So, okay, well, yeah, I mean, I appreciate that.  That's the biggest thing.  That's the religious thing to it.  And, you know, I said I don't care if we do raise the children, you know, Muslim.  Whatever they need for morals, you can do that.  If that's what it takes for good morals.  And that's what you want to preach that way.  But that's not how I've become a good person, you know.  So, all right, Jim. 
[03:47:00]  I appreciate it.  Good luck, man.  Thank you.  Hey, Tim in Pittsburgh.  My thoughts on 12-step programs, they don't seem to work.  Hmm.  What's up, Tim?  Hey, Jim.  How you doing?  Hi.  Hey, question.  I'm an alcoholic.  I come from a medical background.  And my wife is a current physician.  Statistics have shown that 90% of these programs  have a failure rate of 90%.  Probably.  Five of those percent that go back succeed. 
[03:47:30]  The other five fail.  So, I've been to some programs,  and it's obviously not working for me.  Just curious how you got onto your road of sobriety.  Well, you might want to rephrase,  they're not working for you.  Because what happens is,  when you see them working for so many people,  you realize that the formula does work.  Whatever effort you didn't put into it, 
[03:48:00]  maybe you need to put into it.  Maybe you didn't want to be sober more than you wanted to drink.  You have to want it.  You understand?  If you don't want it,  if you want to drink 51%  and you want to be sober 49%,  you're going to drink.  Okay?  It's a program of desire and of want.  You have to want to be sober.  If it was for people who needed it  instead of people who wanted it,  as they said,  the meetings would be held in Yankee Stadium.  There's a lot of drunks.  Most of us do not recover. 
[03:48:30]  Most of us die in that state  where we wind up in jail or institutions.  It's an ugly, ugly long road.  So I would suggest that you have to surrender.  And if you're not going to surrender,  I don't think you have much of a chance of it.  And, you know...  But don't you agree, Jim,  that 90% failure is great?  Is it a looming statistic?  I don't...  To be very honest...  Hold on.  I don't know what...  What's that?  I'm sorry.  There's 90% is a looming statistic 
[03:49:00]  that there is something flawed  with the treatment program  and I'm not knocking...  No, I'll tell you...  I want to become...  I want to become, you know, sober.  Like, tomorrow, I've got health issues  that, you know, I need to deal with  and get taken care of.  But when you look at it  from a statistical standpoint,  it's 90% failure rate is...  You know, that's not a handsome  bush of the roses there.  Well, I mean, that's...  Because that's what it is. 
[03:49:30]  That's what alcoholism is.  Okay?  Because, again,  anybody who wants to be sober  and is willing to work a program...  Again, unless they say  unless you're constitutionally incapable  of being honest with yourself...  But if you're not  and if you're willing  to be honest,  you can get sober.  So, most drug addicts  and alcoholics, I guess,  are not willing.  It is...  I don't know what the success rate is.  You may be correct.  But I know a lot of people 
[03:50:00]  who have developed  long-term sobriety  by doing what is suggested of them.  So, if you know you have health issues  and you want to get sober,  obviously, you didn't have  the willingness before  to do what was necessary.  Stop trying to do it your way.  Realize that your way  got you where you are  and be willing to do it  the way other people suggest  and you'll probably see  better results.  Well, you are absolutely correct  in your statement  in that, you know,  willpower and lack thereof 
[03:50:30]  on my part  and being stubborn  and bullheaded  and I'm trying to find  a way out of it.  But when I look at  the statistics and the data  that say 90% failure rates,  then I go,  well, why bother?  Well, because there's  a 10% success rate.  If that's the accuracy...  And I'm one of the 10%  as of right now.  So, I'm telling you  it's worth it.  All right, gentlemen.  I appreciate your time. 
[03:51:00]  Everything I have  is because I'm sober.  Everything I have.  I was 18.  I was a high school dropout  and I never would have  gone anywhere.  I would have probably  killed myself  before I was 25.  I know, man.  I've listened to you  for years  and saw your show  down in Pittsburgh.  You were phenomenal.  Thank you.  I would suggest  you do the same  for yourself.  I'm not special, dude.  I am just a fucking  babbling,  melodramatic,  drunken asshole.  I really am.  I'm not a powerful, 
[03:51:30]  amazing guy.  I'm a drunken sap  and I got really,  really lucky  and the only thing I did  was I had a willingness  to do what they suggested  and I wanted to be sober  more than I wanted to drink  and I stuck around  like-minded people.  So, that's what I would  suggest for you.  You can do it, okay?  All right.  Appreciate your time, Jeff.  All right, buddy.  Good luck.  Let's see here.  Someone is saying  the stats on the  12-step program  is bullshit. 
[03:52:00]  Maybe it is.  Maybe it's not.  I don't know or care.  And Skippy and Mass,  what do I think  of smoking pot  and not drinking?  Hang on.  What, Iraq?  Here we go.  Hi, Skippy.  What, the phone's  crashed again?  Yeah, hang on.  Well, I can answer  Skippy's question.  Here we go.  Skipper, Skipper,  do you prefer?  Skip?  Yeah, Skip's fine.  Hi, Skipper.  How are ya?  Good, Skippicans.  Now, what do you mean 
[03:52:30]  about smoking pot?  What are you saying?  Well, you know,  I like to smoke.  It relaxes me  and I'm not drinking anymore.  You know,  it's been kind of,  you know,  the thing that I enjoy  doing to relax,  you know,  but I've heard from  meetings and other guys  that have more experience  than I do that  it's just setting myself  up to failure  in the long run.  Think of it this way.  And again,  I find it's all the same.  For me,  alcohol, drugs,  all the same.  People go,  what about taffin?  Like, people just want  to jump in and play 
[03:53:00]  a semantics game.  Okay,  I'm still drinking  because I like coffee.  I guess that's what  you hear about, right?  I guess there's coffee  deaths all the time.  I guess people drink coffee  and drive into walls.  Well, I guess they steal  from their fucking parents  and their loved ones  to get coffee.  You know,  people just play  these bullshit games.  The reality is  if you're still actively  doing drugs,  smoking pot,  again,  I'm not going to morally  judge you,  but I don't think  you can consider yourself  sober.  So if that's working...  No, and I don't. 
[03:53:30]  Okay.  And that's the concern  is that, you know,  I mean,  it's important for me  to stay on the right track.  But again,  you know,  it's like I gave up  a lot already.  And, you know,  hey,  that's my one guilty pleasure.  You know?  Okay, well,  I would say suggest  see how it works for you.  And if it goes okay,  then do it.  But if not,  keep in mind  that there's a better way.  That's what I suggest.  If it's working for you now, 
[03:54:00]  keep doing it  until it doesn't work.  But once it doesn't work  and I predict  that it will stop working  and you will go back  to drinking,  and I'm not trying  to gint you,  I'm just going  by my experience.  If you need to have  that proven to you  by picking up  a drink again,  realize that right now  may be the only shot  you get at getting sober.  Like, this window  you have right now  where you're not drinking  may be the only window  you get in your life  and you may blow it  by smoking the pot.  Is it really worth it?  Like, you know,  I'm not saying  smoking pot's terrible. 
[03:54:30]  Hey, if I could smoke it,  I probably would.  But I can't, dude.  I know where it will lead me.  So maybe you don't know  where it will lead you yet.  Hopefully,  you will put it down  before it proves itself to you  and leads you back to drinking.  That's my suggestion.  My suggestion is,  first and foremost,  to just stop already.  You know you've got a problem.  Stop trying to find  the one little goody  you can still do.  But if you have to,  just remember that  drinking is around the corner  and I hope you get out of it, okay? 
[03:55:00]  All right, brother.  Thanks, Jimmy.  I'm not trying to doom you either.  I'm just going by my experience.  All right, buddy?  No, man, I love you.  You guys need great advice.
