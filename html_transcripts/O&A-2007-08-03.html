<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with the hosts discussing their controversial radio style and their upcoming "O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show" in Detroit.  Anthony's compulsive packing habits were a major topic, punctuated by humorous anecdotes about his frantic last-minute preparations.  Studio guest Rich Voss recounted the birth of his third child, sharing audio recordings from the delivery room.  These recordings, described as both humorous and tense, featured his wife Bonnie's reactions, his own anxieties (particularly about numbers), and his commentary.  The segment also covered the controversy surrounding comedian Stephen Lynch's cancelled Detroit TV appearance due to his use of the word "semen" and mouthing "son of a bitch" during an interview.  The recurring segment, "Is Tom Alive Friday?", featured a call from Tom, a listener battling a serious lung disease, who provided an update on his condition and joked darkly about his potential suicide if his health deteriorated further; listener song suggestions for Tom followed.

The show continued with a morbidly humorous update on Tom's condition, followed by more audio from Rich Voss's wife's childbirth, prompting crude jokes from the hosts and guests.  Tracy Morgan joined the show in studio, and the conversation ranged from Tom's health and the childbirth audio to Tracy's experiences, air guitar, pornography (including a discussion of his own adult films and his son's accidental exposure), and marital issues.  Numerous jokes about sex, childbirth, and other adult themes were made.  The Detroit comedy show was again discussed, and Stephen Lynch called in to detail his disastrous Detroit TV appearance.

Further discussion of the upcoming "Virus Tour," featuring Lynch, Bob Saget, Mancia, Patrice, Otto, George, and Bob Kelly, took place.  The post-show event at the One Village was promoted, mentioning Sideshow Benny, WWE representation, and dancers from Dearborn, Michigan.  The conversation, involving Tracy Morgan, Jim Norton, and Rich Voss, became extremely vulgar and sexually explicit.  Tracy Morgan repeatedly removed his shirt, sharing outrageous anecdotes about his body image, sexual prowess, and past experiences, including a vaguely described "misunderstanding" at a radio station.  The conversation frequently veered into bizarre and nonsensical tangents.

A story about a woman faking a fall in a supermarket for insurance money prompted more raunchy commentary.  Listener calls contributed to the vulgar humor, and more audio of Rich Voss's wife giving birth was played, generating further discussion and crude jokes.  The difficulties with the audio recording equipment were discussed.  The segment focused on Rich Voss's experience at his daughter Reina's birth, including his obsessive focus on camera angles, the chaotic delivery room scene, and the significant amount of blood.  Bonnie Voss was briefly interviewed, and the conversation veered into crude speculation about the newborn's capabilities.  A caller, Sarge, joked about Rich's situation.  A Stephen Lynch song about an ugly baby and a parody of "Chocolate Rain" about Opie's colleague Steve C. were played.  The show also included a discussion of a listener's negative experience with The Little Shelter, speculation about a PR person named Marge, and a caller, Chris, complaining about not receiving promised show tickets.  The broadcast concluded with "lines of the day," plugs for upcoming events and Jim Norton's book, extended ribbing of E-Rock's hair, and a mention of a contest to predict Tom Green's death.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw! 
[00:00:30]  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shot jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, it's brown.  Oh, it's brown.  Smell, smell.  Oh, yeah.  This is where entertainment is going.  You've been stabbed once and shot twice. 
[00:01:00]  No, I've been stabbed twice.  Shot twice.  Who's the common denominator in all these problems?  O.K. and Anthony.  You have to lick a swath of the icing off so that bag shows through where icing was.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning. 
[00:01:30]  Hi.  Hi.  How are you, Anthony?  Good.  On this KGIF.  This is the portion of the show where I ask you how you're doing, even though I know how you're doing,  because we've been hanging out for at least an hour already.  We were chatting in the office about how we're doing.  But we've got to make it good for the radio show.  How are you doing, Anthony?  Good.  And O.K. is probably here for another five minutes.  Then he's got to go pack. 
[00:02:00]  Why?  What happens?  So we can leave on time.  Well, Anthony, like, rolls in his luggage.  Silly me.  I don't know how you do it.  See, you take the suitcase out the night before.  Then you pack it.  We're going to Detroit, obviously, right after the show today for the O&A Traveling Virus Comedy Show tomorrow night.  Can't wait.  It's going to be a great show.  But anyway, so you roll your luggage in, and I'm just like, how do you do that?  You just grab some clothes, shove it in the suitcase the night before, and that way you can just roll it in in the morning. 
[00:02:30]  My brain doesn't work the night before.  I have tried to pack the night before.  I cannot do it.  You know what the worst thing is?  And we do so much traveling with this show, and I can't do it.  And I was like this in college where, you know, big exam, you have weeks to study for it.  I would always have to pull an all-nighter before the exam, and then I go into panic mode, and then I study, and I end up doing okay.  And it's the same way with packing. 
[00:03:00]  Like, how many times have you guys called me, you're like two, three blocks away with the van or whatever, and I'm like, all right, all right.  I'm still, like, packing as you guys are pulling up in a major panic.  Yeah, it's the part that's sitting in front of your place in the van.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Nope.  Never.  Nope.  That's your worry.  That's what I worry about.  But you can ask anyone, no one has ever waited for me because I was still packing. 
[00:03:30]  That is a fact.  Just leave without clothes.  I will get it done.  You know, I'll go home right after this show, and I think I have 35 minutes between the end of the show and pickup, and I will be packed and ready to go for Detroit.  And that's the only way I could do it.  Dude, I literally, I had my suitcase last night, and it's open on my bed, and I slept with my suitcase on my bed.  It's, like, 80% packed.  I have to be packed the night before, or I can't go to school.  Well, that's because you guys are normal in that way.  I don't know what it is. 
[00:04:00]  I've tried to pack the night before, and then I started looking at the clothes I picked, and then that puts me in a panic.  And I'm like, maybe I need this shirt instead, or these jeans, or these sneakers.  It's OCD crap.  Yeah.  It's OCD crap.  And the only way it works is if I do it, like, an hour before I leave for the airport.  Wait, what do you start thinking?  I'm like, oh, if I don't have this, this won't be a good trip, or I have to get, you start thinking of all these things you're supposed to put in there.  I start thinking about what I picked for the trip, and then start thinking, well, but I like that shirt, too, and I like those pants, too, and I like those jeans, too. 
[00:04:30]  And then I just go into this weird OCD thing, and I get all effed up.  Wow.  So I need to be, you know, just packing, like, in a panic an hour before I leave.  I mean, when we take vacations, usually, most people, if you take a vacation, you fly out real early the first day you got off, right?  I wake up at 4 in the morning to pack so I get a 5.15 pickup.  That's crazy.  That's how crazy it is.  When I could have done it the night before and just sleep in maybe a little later and just roll my suitcase to the car. 
[00:05:00]  Isn't that too much pressure?  Yes, it is, but it's the only way it works in my brain for some reason.  I don't know why.  I have an idea.  Try writing out a list of what you need to do.  I've tried that, too.  Does that work either?  I've tried it.  It's the weirdest thing.  I'm telling you.  How did you just say write out a list?  You're packing.  You're throwing clothes in a suitcase.  Why not?  You're not curing a disease.  I mean, he compares it to college.  We pack for two weeks at a time sometimes, and you put it all in.  He's crazy about packing. 
[00:05:30]  Well, you guys have done a lot of traveling because of what you do for a living.  Ant and I finally are to this point where we do a lot of traveling now, so you'd think by now I would have had it figured out.  And here's the funny thing about the whole thing.  I don't even own nice clothes.  And I'm in a panic about, wow, which ratty T-shirt should I take to Detroit?  Are you saying you're not deciding between the Calvin Klein and Joseph Abou?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Ant said, you think you don't have nice clothes.  Here's the thing.  I got like five different suitcases, like a two-week suitcase, a three-day suitcase. 
[00:06:00]  You know, that's how nuts packing is.  I just got the regular suitcase and then the ridiculous going on a two-week vacation with two people, two suitcases that are just, they barely fit.  Like the people are like, oh, you got to pay extra.  I've never seen a bigger suitcase than the one Anthony uses from time to time.  I got those big blue ones, two of them.  Yeah.  Steamer trunks from vaudeville.  But the point is, you put me in a panic rolling in your suitcase because now I'm like, hi. 
[00:06:30]  I got a panic.  Oh, my God.  I got a panic.  Dude, not one piece of clothing is out ready to be packed.  Oh, dude.  I see that.  That's me crazy.  I guarantee when you guys pull up, because it just happens that you guys are being picked up first and then Jimmy and I, because we kind of live in the same area now.  Yeah.  By the time you guys pull up, I will be ready.  I'll even be outside with my suitcase.  Oh, I'll be sweating like a pig.  Oh, geez. 
[00:07:00]  Do we get everything?  I don't know.  We've flown in where we went to our car at the airport in between flights and took clean clothes and put dirty clothes into the trunk and repacked in the trunk to get on another flight without going home.  I've never done that.  Yeah.  We've had it because we've got one time we went away for two weeks, came back for like four hours before we went to London, and we got our car pulled up from the valet, opened the trunk, took clean clothes and dirty clothes out. 
[00:07:30]  What white trash you are.  We had no.  You really are white trash, bro.  You had a valet pull your car up so you could repack in the trunk?  What am I supposed to do if I'm not going home?  I don't know.  Pack more when you leave to begin with, and then just sit in the airport and have a latte?  What's wrong with you?  And someone's saying, have my chick packed for me.  I packed myself.  I know what I, in the end, I know what I want.  You know, my stuff will work in Detroit, whatever.  But anyway, speaking of Detroit, I got some great, not great news, very interesting news from Pete yesterday while I was at the gym. 
[00:08:00]  Pete called in a panic.  We're supposed to do TV all over the place in Detroit.  You heard, right, Jimmy?  Yes.  Oh, this was supposed to be a Fox extravaganza in Detroit.  And we are looking for a certain video.  I guess Stephen Lynch went on the Fox affiliate in Detroit.  Sort of soften up the beaches for us.  Yeah, he went on.  I guess his appearance was great.  It was supposed to be the first piece on the ONA Travel and Virus comedy show.  And then they were going to do pieces like later today, tomorrow morning, early in the afternoon. 
[00:08:30]  We were going to be all over the Fox affiliate in Detroit with this comedy show.  Yep.  But somebody at the radio, somebody at the TV station didn't like what Stephen Lynch sang.  Even though everyone thought it was hilarious, it was very funny, it was a great appearance.  This guy didn't like it to the point where Stephen Lynch was supposed to come back for a second segment.  And they kicked him out of the TV station.  Told him, you're done, and so is everybody from the Virus tour. 
[00:09:00]  And they canceled, yes, all TV appearances.  Which would have, A, helped our comedy show, and B, helped our radio show up in Detroit.  Yeah.  I mean, it's a known fact we're not doing well in the ratings in Detroit, and this would have really helped to get our faces and our names out there a little bit more.  Yeah.  So they canceled all TV appearances because of Stephen Lynch.  Stephen Lynch!  Yeah.  He's not that crazy.  No.  Imagine if we did, had gone on there, the crap we would have said. 
[00:09:30]  Right.  Man.  So we're trying to find the video.  And we'll get Stephen Lynch on the phone to get the whole story.  See how crazy he was.  But he got so insane that the guy just kicked him out.  Not even in a nice way.  Kicked him out.  And then called Pete and said, we're canceling all TV appearances.  Cancel all appointments.  We're canceling the O.P. and Anthony appearance, and then there was going to be an appearance.  Did you do one already, though?  Did you tape one, Jimmy?  No.  So yours is canceled.  And then there was going to be another one with all of us.  I think there were three or four different segments they were going to do for this thing. 
[00:10:00]  So there's a little controversy in Detroit this morning.  Yeah.  And we want to get to the bottom of this one.  I don't know.  It was one word he said.  And, you know, Lynch is not dirty.  I mean, he can be.  But he also knows how to clean up for radio.  So he probably did what he could have done on radio.  And they just had to go for it.  Supposedly, the people at the station, they were loving it, though.  But it was one guy.  Yeah, one guy.  One guy.  One of the bosses must not have.  Oh, I don't like that.  Or maybe some chick, you know. 
[00:10:30]  Oh, that's.  Well, this is the world we live in.  You know, everyone's so scared to lose their jobs that they're going to be so conservative with their decision making.  Something happened to Jimmy at Jimmy Kimmel.  He was told one thing, but I'll say it.  I don't believe it, Jimmy.  I'm sorry.  Jimmy had a great set on Jimmy Kimmel.  I don't believe it.  Wednesday night, Jimmy had a great set on Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah.  And one of his lines was cut out.  I didn't love the set, for the record.  I thought it was mediocre, but I appreciate you being my friend. 
[00:11:00]  I liked your set, and I liked how you addressed the crowd at the end of it.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they were a bunch of broads.  I didn't care for them.  And, you know, I figured people would know I didn't like them.  Yeah, I could tell by his little parting comment.  You said that you had been a piece, a slice of heaven.  A slice of heaven.  Well, it wasn't your audience.  They were all there for Mark Anthony, right?  And there was, like, someone pointed out there was young girls waving Mark Anthony dolls.  And when I walked out, it's a very weird setup because you're not in the middle like you are on Leno or Letterman. 
[00:11:30]  You're off to the side.  Well, you didn't know they weren't Norton dolls.  Did the dolls have a chin?  No.  Go ahead, Tom.  Let Jimmy tell the story.  It was kind of funny.  It was all right.  It was all right.  I just went kindly sheepishly, like, no.  I'm more annoyed that I had nothing for that awful remark he made.  No, but they were just, they weren't my crowd, and I knew they weren't my crowd.  I went out, and I saw all girls.  And anyway, I did panel, and I was talking about being on the bestsellers, and I made fun of the fact that stupid Princess Diana's book is ahead of me. 
[00:12:00]  And then I made fun of Al Gore, and I smashed his book, and said he was stupid, and he's trying to save the world, and here I am banging fat chicks, and it got a good laugh, and they took it out.  But didn't you say something like, I get it, the earth is melting?  The earth is melting.  I get it.  You know, it really, it got a good laugh, and they took it out.  But they said, and I do believe them, because they didn't, they said it was a timing issue, and Jonathan said they were really apologetic, and they weren't trying to censor you. 
[00:12:30]  But that's a great line.  Interesting.  Yeah, another line I wish they would have taken out instead, but they are very pressed for time there, because they're literally finishing up right before they have to go back on the air.  Right.  You tape late in L.A., you tape it like, the show's over at 9 in L.A., and I think it's starting.  It starts at midnight here.  So literally, they have a quick turnaround time, so they probably just went in there and found a segment, like, all right, 15 seconds, chop.  They don't have time to edit, like, Leno has time to edit, because you tape it at 6. 
[00:13:00]  You tape it, I taped it, it was done by 9 o'clock at Kimmel.  Wow.  You had to go, like, and talk to standards and practice there, like.  Yeah, I read through my, I read through with the producer on the phone, my act, because I'm not typing it out, I'm too lazy.  Yeah, they met, and they, back when I did, I did that Indian-style joke.  Yeah.  Indian-style.  And the standard of practice was a girl from India, and she says, well, I find this, I go, it's not about you, it's about Native Americans.  But it's about American Indians.  And it was one person, everybody, nah, I don't think you should do this. 
[00:13:30]  So it's one person's opinion in these standards and practices, usually.  It's the same with the special I'm doing.  I'm saying one person's opinion, like, if they don't like the joke, just like in Detroit, if one person, they'll say, no, you can't take it out.  It's not a legal thing.  Yeah.  It's a personal issue with a lot of these people.  They'll put them in charge.  Yeah, of course it's a personal issue.  Being a professional, I didn't have that issue.  I mean, some people, like Richard, would have that issue. 
[00:14:00]  I didn't have that issue.  No, they didn't take anything out.  But I don't know if it was a, it was just a timing thing.  I think they're still pressed for time.  They would have even went 15-second honked there with this bing.  Dude, it was a killer line, and it's so topical.  They obviously should have left it in.  Something else was going on.  I have to say that.  Was there a fan in there that saw it?  Oh, yeah.  It made Whack Bag.  I was reading about your appearance on Kimmel.  Yeah.  And it was pretty cool to see the cover of your book on Jimmy Kimmel.  Yeah, and I'll tell you, that's one thing he did wonderfully.  He holds that stupid book up a lot. 
[00:14:30]  It really made me feel good.  Very cool.  Embarrassed.  And then really fast, Bob Saget was on Leno last night, gave us a nice plug for the show  tomorrow night up there in the Detroit area.  In case you missed it, it's really fast.  Here we go.  Are you working lots of something on the road?  I'm doing good.  I'm doing, you know, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, yeah, they've been here.  Right?  I'm on the traveling virus, doing a few dates with them, and it's fun.  It's like 10,000, 20,000 people.  Wow.  And Diamond Vision, I curse in Diamond Vision, which is a lot of fun for the kids.  So there you go. 
[00:15:00]  We got a nice little mention on Leno through Bob Saget.  Thank you, Bob.  So there you have it.  And, of course, Rich Voss in studio today, and Rich is a father for the third time.  Yep.  You know.  A brand new daddy.  I was hoping for a little more than, yep.  I see if I still have the message Voss left me.  I'm hoping I still have it.  Oh.  I saved it.  I was going to play it on the air.  Yeah.  But I don't know if I still have it, Rich.  Just how...  Why?  Was he...  He's just rich.  He's just rich.  Well, here's the thing. 
[00:15:30]  You know, you're in the hospital, and I'm so out of it, but Bonnie is so nice and really  nice, but she's on Percocet.  Oh, that's what she's nice.  And then we had a fight last night.  Like, the Percocet wore off, and her trueness came out, and we started fighting.  I'm fighting with a lady that just was cut open to pieces in a hospital.  Then they came back in, gave her more Percocet, and she's the sweetest person.  So what I'm saying is, I have to get her addicted to Percocet.  Addicted to Percocet. 
[00:16:00]  And she'll be great.  They're so calm and sweet.  I'm telling you.  You want to get her addicted to drugs.  That's fantastic, Rich.  I think morphine, I would love to come home.  What was the fight about?  It just sounds spooky.  She's married to an idiot.  That's what every fight's about.  Well, Rich is a trooper for the radio show.  He brought in audio.  We're going through it right now.  He taped the whole thing.  Yeah.  Did he tape the actual slicing and dicing and the grab? 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You got the grab and everything?  Yeah, I'm going to tell you.  I went out and bought a new recorder for this.  Nice.  You know, like a stereo recorder.  It was cool.  The doctors, I tried to get a camera and they said, no, you can't bring it because of legal  reasons.  Right, right.  Yeah, they don't want that documented for a lawsuit.  Yeah.  Just in case something slips up.  Oops.  I thought you could videotape births.  If you're the Bravo Film Network or something.  You used to be able to back in the day, but then because of malpractice and all that  crap, they banned video cameras. 
[00:17:00]  Well, I told them on the air the other day.  When you're delivering.  Huh?  They wouldn't even let me watch her get an epidural.  Well, because I told them, a guy was watching his wife get an epidural and he fainted and  fell and hit his head and died.  Wow.  Really?  Why am I laughing at that?  Because it's so stupid you got to.  The guy saved himself years of misery by fainting.  He got out of it.  Wow, really?  So, Sam is going through the audio.  Hopefully, we'll have it after the break, at least some of it.  But congratulations to Rich. 
[00:17:30]  Thanks.  You're crazy.  I openly laughed at you when you called me.  I'm like, dude, you had two daughters almost out of the house and now you've decided to  start all over again.  Well, my daughters and my ex-wife at four and two were out of the house.  But here's the thing.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  But you're thinking, okay, my daughter's going to be 18.  That's a little child support, less child support I have to pay, which of course I'll  give my kids money, but it's a less responsibility in life. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  And I had three more years for the other one.  I'm going, hey, I can go to Florida, play golf whenever I want.  So, the good thing is, Bonnie said, this baby is 85% hers and I don't argue.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah?  Well, yeah.  So, you're not really going to be taking any active role as a dad in this kid's life?  Well, I am.  I'm holding the baby yesterday.  Who does the baby look like?  I don't know. 
[00:18:30]  The Chinese neighbor.  Let's just pray we know who the baby thinks like.  All right.  More with Rich Voss after the break.  Hey, it's FU Friday.  It's also Point and Laugh Friday.  I feel like we're going to be doing a lot of pointing in your direction, Rich, today.  Mispronunciation Friday.  Perfect that you're here for that one as well.  Air Guitar Friday.  And is Tom Alive Friday?  What?  Is Tom Alive Friday?  You don't remember Tom?  Oh, that Tom. 
[00:19:00]  I thought you remember Tom.  We took last Friday off, so we didn't get the Tom update last time.  Yes.  So, we need to know, is Tom Alive?  Remember Tom?  You don't remember Tom?  Were you here?  Were you on the road, Jimmy?  What the hell's wrong with him?  The lung thing?  Yeah, he's got the lung thing where he could, like, barely had any lung capacity.  And he can barely walk upstairs, and he's a huge fan of our show.  He just called out of nowhere.  And we made him do a rock screen.  Oh, yes, yes.  I think it was a punky sound.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Not to be confused with our fine boss. 
[00:19:30]  That's what I thought.  That survived skin cancer and is doing very, very well.  It's one of our listeners.  Oh, yeah, I remember that guy.  It's Tom Alive Friday.  We basically said to this guy that, look, we'll get an update every Friday.  And the Friday that we don't get an update from you, we just got to assume the worst.  Yeah, assume he's dead.  We got to just assume the worst.  But he's a faithful listener to the show.  His lungs are basically giving out on the poor guy.  Anyway, so sometime this morning, we're hoping to get the update from Tom as well. 
[00:20:00]  Why don't you tell Tom where he could call us?  All right, 877-212-ON-A.  877-212-ON-A.  Imagine he just, like, sleeps in today, and then we got all of America thinking that Tom's  dead.  Assume he's dead.  Tom, you better call today.  Hope he's not a mayor anywhere.  Huh?  Hope he's not a mayor anywhere.  What?  See, that was the old mayor.  That you announced Tom was dead.  Tom Manino.  Tom Manino.  10 years ago? 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, that was terrific.  Oh, I didn't even get it.  Yeah.  So you'd be doing your set in Mississippi on a bridge, will you?  In Minneapolis?  Didn't even tie in.  Is that where it is?  Yeah.  It was over the Mississippi River.  All right, right east.  Right, first letter, wrong dumbbells.  Let's regroup.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  We got a real busy day today.  We got Tracy Morgan coming in at 7 o'clock. 
[00:21:00]  Tracy Morgan.  Right after the show, we head to the airport to fly to Detroit for the big ONA traveling  virus comedy show tomorrow night.  The Aerodrome.  Eight comedians you know and love from this radio show.  All the info is on VirusTour, one word on MySpace.  But the headline, if you got a military ID, we're letting you in free tomorrow.  Don't forget that, okay?  I got a signing tonight, too, by the way.  Yeah.  It's 7.30 at Borders on 34300 Woodward and Birmingham.  I'll be selling my book and signing it and kissing everybody on the mouth. 
[00:21:30]  Aw.  And it's brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  And there's a bit of controversy.  We're trying to find Stephen Lynch's TV appearance from yesterday.  A bunch of people said it was really, really funny.  Somebody that works at the...  I keep saying radio.  Somebody that...  Well, the radio guys told us about it, actually.  That's why.  But somebody that works at Fox up there in Detroit had a problem, thought it was too  edgy or something.  The language, something was wrong.  Yeah.  And kicked Stephen Lynch out of the studio. 
[00:22:00]  Wouldn't allow him to do a second segment.  And then canceled all TV.  Ed and I were going to do TV tomorrow.  Jimmy was going to do TV.  The comics were going to do TV.  So we're trying to hunt down that video to see what the big deal was.  Because I hear he kept it TV friendly.  But this was a personal decision by one of the bigwigs that works at Fox.  So I don't know.  Hopefully one of our pests recorded it or something and could get us a copy.  Ridiculous. 
[00:22:30]  Basically what I want to do and we want to play it in front of everybody tomorrow.  Oh, hell yeah.  And then basically tell the crowd that Fox effed us and canceled all our TV.  And get a big boo.  Oh, the place will go nuts.  And then the pests might get involved.  Yeah, it'll be good.  Oh, it'll be great.  So hopefully we can battle.  Hopefully we can find that.  At the very least, we'll have Stephen Lynch calling a little later to tell us what the  hell happened yesterday up there in Detroit.  We got Rich Voss in studio.  His kid was born two days ago now, Rich. 
[00:23:00]  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Tuesday.  5.52.  Brand spanking new.  Is it looking normal now and not like all goopy and that brand new wrinkly kid look?  Yeah, it was like a grayish purple.  It was horrible.  It's like something out of Alien for God's sake.  Yeah.  It just isn't right.  There's just so much stuff around it and touching it and hanging off it.  It just grows inside a big bloody mess.  You just want to pop it out.  Who the hell thought it?  Just because you had a cesarean, did you have to get the haircut? 
[00:23:30]  She did.  It's like Julius Caesar cut.  Are you talking about me?  Yes.  I know.  It really is awful.  I look like a Roman nickel, right?  Roman nickel.  It looks like you got a C-section as well as what we're getting at.  What's my haircut I've had?  His hair.  Caesar.  It's a C-section haircut.  Straight across, you idiot.  That haircut should come with a betrayal. 
[00:24:00]  Where's your toga?  At 2, Jim.  At 2.  I bring you.  This is the very brief message disconnected creep left me the other day.  Hold on.  We, the girl, 6 pounds, 11 ounces.  I'm having an anxiety attack.  And I have a new diamond bezel for my watch. 
[00:24:30]  That's what he says.  And I have a new diamond bezel for my watch.  Good audio, by the way.  Thanks, iPhone.  Boy.  That was good.  It's quality.  Boy, way to have some excitement.  It was awful.  And you always have to make it about yourself.  What about poor Bonnie?  I bought her a diamond bezel, too.  Oh, great.  Hey.  It was anxiety.  Sam went through your, I don't know, four hours of audio tape, by the way.  Jesus.  And we got some fine clips of Rich Voss having a kid. 
[00:25:00]  Thank God.  Sorry.  I can't have her edit delivery.  Holy crap.  I don't want to miss anything.  Could you move along here?  We're losing light.  Right.  I think Sam started editing this at midnight.  He's finally done.  And we got some highlights for everybody.  Voss is flashing the flashlight in the corner and telling him to hurry up.  Yeah.  The first track, Voss criticizes the doctor's storytelling.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Just the doctor that's going to cut open your wife, right? 
[00:25:30]  This was the anesthesiologist.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  All right.  Let's take a listen to this.  Actually, this is funny.  When we do anesthesia, actually, we have to learn all the anesthesia parts.  It's a big 450-pound machine.  It's called an anesthesia machine.  That we use gases and everything.  But each part, we have to actually learn.  And in fact, something goes wrong with the machine, we're supposed to fix it. 
[00:26:00]  But I have to learn everything part of it.  And you have an anesthesia.  In great-grandchildren, it's like this.  But you know what?  That's kind of a cool story.  But in America, we wouldn't consider that funny.  That's not funny.  Like you said, this is funny.  We were waiting for something.  Yeah, the city is right.  Exactly.  I don't know.  That's not funny.  It's not funny.  Yeah, you were right.  Well, when he said this is funny, I was waiting for a good story. 
[00:26:30]  All right, what happened there?  It was hard to hear the anesthesiologist.  But you beat him up because he didn't tell a funny story.  He started off and goes, this is funny.  So I'm waiting for a good story.  And he just told me an anesthesiology story.  Yeah.  And there wasn't any humor there.  And these people from India, you have to set them straight.  Because their humor is non-existent.  Yeah.  So you say, in here in America, that isn't funny.  Don't tell that joke. 
[00:27:00]  That was Bonnie laughing in the background?  Over the beeping?  Yeah, the beeping's a little obnoxious.  Well, that was...  Yeah.  I wanted them to take her heart monitor off during the taping.  Right.  But they had to keep that, you know...  I guess so.  I guess they would have to.  Probably important.  Boss comforts Bonnie before she gives birth.  Here's the clip.  Aw.  I'm here.  Did you know I was here?  Yeah.  Huh?  Yes.  Does she want us playing this?  What's that?  She's cool with this? 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  She just...  Seems like a very personal moment we're about to listen to.  Is she...  What was her mood here?  You need air time this bad?  Was she crying?  Was she...  Well, here's...  You need air time this bad?  What the hell, man?  You told me.  Every nine months, he comes in with great clips.  Right.  Oh, my God.  I haven't been on Opiate Anthony in a while.  I better have another kid.  Well, you know what?  You got...  Fast forward five years, you have another six.  You're just pumping them out.  Excuse me, sir.  The Brady Dunst. 
[00:28:00]  It just hit me that this might be a bit of a personal moment.  She just called and I kind of ignored her.  Yeah.  But here's the thing.  Does she know that you taped all this and you were bringing it in?  Yes.  All right.  Cool.  The one thing she wanted to edit it out, we did.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  What's her frame of mind here?  Like, is she happy or is she crying?  You can't really tell sometimes.  Well, now she's kind of scared or like, aw.  She's like pretty high from...  And she's laying...  If this is the part where they're getting ready to take the baby out, she's laying down, 
[00:28:30]  but she has a big light sheet in front of her.  She can't see them.  Yeah, they don't want them seeing, you know...  You know, them cut her open.  Cut open like that.  And she's there and she's kind of like...  She's freaking out.  She's having a panic attack almost.  Oh, boy.  She gets into a panic attack.  And we get to hear this?  Yeah.  I'm pretty sure of you.  Oh, my God.  You're the worst.  I loved it.  I loved it.  By the way, Steven asked for Bayshore, was that beeping going off an idiot detector? 
[00:29:00]  Steve.  An idiot detector.  Bravo, Steve.  Holy Jesus.  An idiot detector.  And then Kevin from Connecticut.  You sure you want to go down this path?  Because they're just revving up out there.  Oh, yeah.  Kevin from Connecticut writes,  Bonnie was crying because she realized that it was Rich's baby.  Oh, no. 
[00:29:30]  It's not black.  Give me the answer feedback.  They're on a roll.  The gang's on a roll today.  They're trying to outdo each other.  All right.  So, we get Voss comforting Bonnie before she gives birth here.  I'm here.  Did you know I was here?  Yeah.  Huh?  Yes.  Huh?  Please don't make me laugh.  Please don't make me laugh.  I'm not making you laugh.  I'm just saying you didn't know I was here.  Yeah, I did.  You didn't think the doctor was rubbing your arm, did you? 
[00:30:00]  Please stop.  I'm not thinking of the good one.  I'm not saying anything.  You know what I can tell you?  I was a good one.  I'm not thinking of anything.  Oh, wow.  What's that?  It's my arm.  Hold on.  You have pressure.  Oh, my God.  How effed up is she right there?  I know.  We've hung the body many times.  She is giddy. 
[00:30:30]  Wow.  The Indian doctor in the back is laughing when I go, it's me, not the doctor.  Right.  He's like, he's our best audience because, you know, they find out you're comedians.  Yeah.  So they're all trying to be funny in there and they're all trying to, you know, am I going  to be part of your act?  Yeah.  You know, listen.  The best part of that clip is Bonnie going, oh, wow, what's that?  And I'm thinking the doctor came in with his pants down or something.  Is that what you're supposed to look like?  My arm.  Right, that's what I was getting at.  An un-clipped gentleman.  Was it a nice muscle?  And Rich goes, my arm. 
[00:31:00]  Well, the Haas, yeah.  Yeah.  Because it hurts squeaky doors and stuff there.  What?  I don't know.  You think they oiled the door up a little bit?  Well, yeah.  Right after the delivery, they brought maintenance in.  Oh, okay.  And they did.  The door and the floor.  You know who my wife is?  Uh.  Men are coming here to kill her.  Could you help me move her into another room?  Downtown Dave from Kansas City writes, please don't make me laugh.  Like, that's a problem.  Oh, God, boy. 
[00:31:30]  They really are coming out with them.  Are you flying with us, Rich?  No.  Tomorrow.  Old, uh, old Rich Ware wears some...  Oh, the guy, it wasn't written perfectly, but basically this guy's, uh, Gut Shot Drew from  Howell, he writes, did Rich wear some  Daisy Dukes and a half shirt to get  Bonnie some extra pain drugs? 
[00:32:00]  And I'm being informed by  Steve from Bayshore that that squeaking  wasn't the door, it was the sound of Voss's  wallet opening.  Yeah, because we tipped  the doctors.  I think he's implying you're a cheap Jew.  Here's 100. I hope everything  goes smoothly. Come on.  Come on, duck.  Alright, the next clip, Voss continues  to comfort Bonnie but tells the doctor he's  not giving accurate times.  What's that about? 
[00:32:30]  Alright, we'll find out.  I don't even know.  Oh, yeah, because I wanted the baby born.  Yeah, talk to me.  Yeah.  Talk to me.  You can't look at me, though.  You can't look at me?  Like, it feels weird.  Oh, God.  You said that already five minutes, three minutes ago. 
[00:33:00]  You're going to be good.  Look at that.  You're holding up perfect.  So we're five minutes away from you having another kid right there, huh?  Well, here's the thing.  I was sitting there looking at the clock, and I'm kind of like, like you say, obsessive  compulsive, and certain numbers scare me.  So it was like quarter to six, right?  I didn't want the baby born after six, because six is an unlucky number.  So I wanted, I'm serious.  Like, I was thinking, I kept, I'm looking, I'm holding her, but I'm looking at the clock  like that, going, well, if the baby's born at 6.06, that's two out of three of the devil's 
[00:33:30]  numbers.  Right.  Right?  And I'm, like, freaked out.  So he's going five minutes, so I'm going, well, that's going to be well before six.  Can we hurry up and wrap this thing up?  Uh, because I just.  Devil's numbers?  Yeah.  Three, six.  He's red-lighting the doctor.  Yeah.  That's great.  Yeah, wrap it up, Doc.  Come on.  Well, because, you know, doctors, they always tell you, you know, 15 minutes, 20 minutes,  you know, just tell me, you know, what's going on.  Well, he is telling you what's going on. 
[00:34:00]  He's not, he's not Jesus.  Well, he's not, that doctor is the Indian, the, whatever, it's hard to say.  He's the one that knocks him out.  Pat from Menocky, he writes, wow, Bonnie's loopy.  Rich should distribute Percocets to all his gigs.  But, you know what, here's the thing.  You can compare me, you can trash me on the radio, you will never see me fail on stage.  And Kevin from Connecticut writes, six is an unlucky number for Rich?  That's his IQ.  141.  Now I'm not even having funny comebacks, I'm giving facts. 
[00:34:30]  No, you're not.  I'm 141 IQ.  You've even got a decimal point.  I'm 141, I'll do it any time here.  This next clip, uh, what were you doing that the doctor had to make sure you were okay?  You're not giving birth.  I probably looked over at the, uh, the incision.  Oh, got a little, uh, queasy.  All right, let's take a listen here.  I'm almost hungry, doctor.  Son, son.  Come on, okay? 
[00:35:00]  You okay?  Yeah.  I'm good.  You're sweating.  I'm not sweating.  Huh?  I'm not sweating.  You sure?  I'm thinking.  You don't have to pass on?  No.  Pass on.  You sure?  Yeah, why would I pass on?  You hear that, you hear that suction thing?  Yeah.  You would think that was for the blood, but they had that in my mouth, so I didn't drool  on Bonnie.  Or maybe they, maybe they thought you were sweating because the glue from your Frankenstein 
[00:35:30]  wig was running down your forehead.  Hey, Boris K, you're sweating.  I think you got a two-for-one C-section there.  What's wrong?  I'm just sitting there.  I've had it every time.  No, this is a little different.  No, you're definitely going with a Julius Caesar look there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit?  Yeah.  He's a muster.  I saw it.  It kind of has like a Herman Munster thing to do to it. 
[00:36:00]  Now, breathe, Lily.  Breathe.  Grandpa, get the C-section done.  I'm a daddy.  Eddie, come look at your sister.  And Frankenstein.  Terrible.  All right. 
[00:36:30]  Do we have time to, this is the big get right here.  Bonnie gives birth.  Yeah, here it is.  This is where Rich becomes a father for the third time.  Steve from Base George.  Calling him Droolius Caesar.  Ah, damn.  Oh, Steve's on fire.  Droolius Caesar.  Here it is. 
[00:37:00]  Bonnie gives birth, everybody.  Is this it?  I believe so.  What's that?  Oh.  A lot of pressure.  Oh.  That is pressure, Bonnie.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  What the hell is that?  Oh.  Bonnie doesn't sound good there.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  She's watching Norton on dress. 
[00:37:30]  What was she doing there?  That was hurtful.  Why would you do that?  That was just mean spirited.  Why would you do that to Jimmy?  Exactly.  Why?  He's been your friend for so long.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Frankenstein wig.  He was just being accurate.  Yeah.  What's the oh about?  Obviously not audio of the conception. 
[00:38:00]  A big, longer flow.  I'm so excited to get that one out.  I spit all over it right now.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe you didn't open a car door and lean to the curb.  Bonnie, are you okay?  I broke my water, dude. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  This is what's going to happen.  We have to take a break.  Goddamn Rich Boss.  I kill Rich Boss.  Oh, that's a great idea.  God, our listeners are good.  All right.  We'll figure it out during the break.  All right.  We have to take a break because we don't want to rush through this.  We got Bonnie giving birth right after the break and then some of the aftermath.  That's really, really good.  Really good.  There's a clip where Voss is fiddling with his camera while all hell's breaking loose in the 
[00:39:00]  freaking delivery room.  Bonnie's got a new baby and Voss cares more about his dumb camera.  I can't wait to play that clip.  It's all on the way.  Also, Stephen Lynch is calling in to tell us what happened during his TV appearance yesterday  in Detroit.  And hopefully after the break, we'll find out if Tom's alive.  It is Tom from White Plains.  Tom from White Plains. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  I'm hearing that he may call in after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's Opie and Anthony with little Jimmy Norton and Rich Voss.  Very busy show today.  We got Tracy Morgan coming in in about a half hour.  We got more audio of Bonnie giving birth.  That I got to hear.  And you asked what hospital.  It's Somerset, the hospital, and they're great there.  They really are.  The nurses, everybody's been really nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, they really are.  You think, you know, some hospitals, they don't care. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  But at least on Somerset, they've really been really nice and helpful.  All right.  Very cool.  So I just want to say that.  Also.  Plugging a hospital.  And for the record, can I throw out real quick?  Yeah.  Squeeze stinks.  We were having the old man music discussion.  Old man music discussion.  Well, Anthony met the lead singer of Squeeze last night.  Yeah.  Or yesterday afternoon, whatever.  I'm like, who's Squeeze?  I know the name.  I just didn't know any song.  Tempted by the fruit of another.  That song.  Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.  There you go. 
[00:40:30]  Something about a toothbrush.  I bought a toothbrush, a toothpaste, a flannel for my face, pajamas, a hairbrush, new shoes,  and a case.  I said to my reflection, let's get out of this place.  Oh, this is terrible.  Past the church and the steeple, the laundry on the hill.  Jim, sing.  Billboards and the...  No?  No.  No, he's so aggravated. 
[00:41:00]  This makes me want to squeeze my neck with a rope.  This is a terrible song.  There is the big chorus.  This is the big chorus.  Everybody, here we go.  Come on.  Pound talk, let's go.  Tempted by the fruit of another.  He's tempted by the fruit of another.  A little tink-a-link of the piano is a tink-a-link.  Tink.  T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t.  They used to tink along back in the early 80s.  This song is...  It's enragingly awful. 
[00:41:30]  How is it enragingly awful?  Tempted by the fruit of another.  Yes, he's tempted by the fruit of another.  Oh, and it is Air Guitar Friday.  Oh, oh, wow.  Finally.  It's being done.  Opie is playing air guitar.  It's more air bass.  They really didn't believe in guitars in the early 80s, these idiots.  Oh, we never did that.  Air Guitar Friday.  Someone actually finally did it.  That's another song.  That's right.  Pulling muscles from a shell.  Pulling muscles from a shell.  Do they sing about anything but drivel? 
[00:42:00]  You know this one?  No.  It's a good song right here.  Listen to a harmony.  Yeah.  Lazing about this beach all day at night.  The crickets are green.  It's terrible.  Plink, plink, plink, plink, plink.  They were huge back in the day, Jimmy.  Without a doubt.  Huge.  Not big, but...  No.  Here we go.  You know this one? 
[00:42:30]  Nope.  Squeeze will be playing the Beacon Theater tonight.  Which?  Here's the hook.  My little friend.  He's pulling muscles from a shell.  How about black coffee in bed?  Pulling muscles from a shell?  How about dipping shrimp in cocktail sauce?  This guy's awful.  How about a little...  Pudding lemon on my seafood. 
[00:43:00]  Do it, man.  How about this one, Jimmy?  You know this one.  One more and then we...  Terrible.  One more and then we got to move back to the audio of Bonnie Giving Birth.  Let's go.  You know this one?  Yes, I've heard this.  Black coffee in bed.  I don't remember this song.  I like this riff.  That's a riff?  That.  Whatever it is.  Little stuff squeezed.  They were huge back in the 80s.  Yeah, what else were huge?  There's a stain on my notebook where you're coffee cover water. 
[00:43:30]  The lyrics are really dull.  Yeah.  There's a stain on my notebook where you're...  There's ash in the pages.  Now I've got myself lost.  Yeah, I hate this one, too.  Booty boop.  All right.  All right, well, let's...  Let's squeeze.  Crapola.  We were...  Like I said, my good friends squeeze playing the Beacon Theater tonight.  Tonight.  Very good.  Hopefully there's a lot of tickets available.  I'm sure they'll sell out.  They never did anything to you, Jimmy. 
[00:44:00]  They're nice guys.  I don't wish them ill in their personal lives.  I just think all their music catalogs will be burned.  They haven't played in I don't know how long.  It's been a while.  Everyone has to get back together now.  That's the new trend.  All right.  We were going to play more of the audio of Bonnie Giving Birth, but it is...  Is Tom Alive Friday?  Right.  You might remember Tom, our friend from White Plains with lung problems.  And we don't know how long he's going to be alive. 
[00:44:30]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm proud to announce that Tom is alive.  Ah.  Tom?  Yes.  How are you guys?  There he is.  This is...  Oh, I'm still alive.  Yeah.  Tom's theme song for the time being.  Oh, no.  We're going to have a different Alive song every week.  Oh, I'm still alive.  Yeah. 
[00:45:00]  What do you think of this, Jim?  I'm still alive.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Don't like it.  No?  You don't like this?  What is that?  Pearl Jam.  Yeah.  One of their huge hits.  It's probably my favorite Pearl Jam song.  You know, call me a Pearl Jam hack.  No, mine's Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town.  Oh, I hate that one.  I don't know that one either.  Give me some Elderly Woman Behind a Counter.  Elderly?  Why did you say old?  It's Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town.  Hit it.  Oh, no.  Is it about him finding meaning?  Even Flo and I'm Alive and Jeremy. 
[00:45:30]  Listen to the vocals.  That's it.  Listen to the vocals.  Oh, by the way, Squeeze is sold out tonight.  Jim.  I went to the other one, too.  Hold on here. 
[00:46:00]  He really built it out a second here.  I want to say I'm a team.  Oh, my God.  Fat boy.  Fat boy.  Where's the part we go?  Waiting tomorrow. 
[00:46:30]  I want the other part.  Hello.  Hello.  Jesus.  I'll go listen to my iPod.  I'm sorry.  Tom, White Plains, you're alive.  What's going on, buddy?  Not much.  Not much.  You guys had a great week.  Yesterday's What the Hell is That was fantastic.  You probably look at it differently, though, than normal listeners.  Like, even if we do a crappy show, it's great to you because you're breathing. 
[00:47:00]  And let's put it in terms you can understand.  You shouldn't say we had a great week.  You should say that we had a great year.  Yeah.  How are the little lungs doing?  Yeah, we haven't heard from you in two weeks because we took last Friday off.  Hanging in there.  Hanging in there.  I have a lung test today.  So, I'll tell you more next week.  What do you got to do on your test?  They give him a straw and they try to get him to sift some soda out of it. 
[00:47:30]  That's a crazy straw, Jimmy.  Crazy straw.  So, what do you have to do for your test?  Yeah, what's the test?  Oh, you sit in a little acrylic box and they torture you for about 30 minutes by blowing  in and out of a tube.  And it's very uncomfortable.  You sit in a box and they measure the air in the room?  Yeah, what the hell is that about?  It's like, yeah, it's like a little, like... 
[00:48:00]  Do they keep you under a bed?  Like half a golf cart covered in acrylic and it, you know, so it equalizes.  Yeah.  And what do you just breathe in there?  And you breathe in there.  And they...  Types of breathing.  And they go, oh, you're breathing.  Yeah.  And they, you know, depending on how the test comes out, it's like, well, that's good.  Or...  Can we get you on a... 
[00:48:30]  Can we get you on an exercise bike and just really get you cranking?  Sure.  Do you have an exercise bike?  No, no, I got rid of it.  Yeah.  Do they have lung...  I think it was downstairs.  Do they have lung transplants?  Yeah, they have lung transplants.  Now, Tom, what is wrong with you again?  Because people are just getting involved in the is Tom Alive bit.  I suffer from sarcoidosis, third stage. 
[00:49:00]  Oof.  And with multi-organ involvement.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Including heart, lungs, and central nervous system.  Wow.  And what's the prognosis?  The prognosis is cardiac sarcoidosis is...  Well, that doesn't sound that bad. 
[00:49:30]  Statistically, death, usually within seven years of diagnosis.  And how long have you been diagnosed?  Uh...  2001.  Wow.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, six years.  Oh, boy.  But those are statistics.  Yeah, hey, I like how you...  Hey, you know, keep your chin up.  And the good news is you're working the third stage.  That's the big one.  Yeah.  You're almost there. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, I move in the...  I'm trying to move up to stage four, you know, so I can get the big lung transplant.  Ah.  But then you gotta take more drugs.  Yeah, so it doesn't reject your lungs.  You can't get a lung transplant until you get to the fourth stage?  No.  And what about your...  You need, like, heart-lung transplant, right?  Oh, I thought he died on us.  Holy Jesus, I thought he died on us.  Tom, please, don't pause. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I mean, every pause, we're on the edge of our seat here.  And a pause for you is like, you're wasting a lot of your time that you have left.  That's true.  Oh.  But that's life.  Well, yeah, I call it that.  I can...  I can...  Oh.  Yeah, I can...  I can fire my gun.  Oh, you're right.  You said, like, if you get really bad, you're just gonna shoot yourself. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, Tom already said that he's gonna take himself out when it gets really bad.  Oh, throw yourself out a window?  No, I'll blow the gun out the window.  Oh.  How are you gonna do that after you shoot yourself?  I will not shoot myself now.  I'm still walking.  Oh.  No, he has a gun.  He just wants to fire it to prove to everyone that he has a gun that he's gonna use when  it gets really, really bad.  Yeah, but we can't have him shooting a gun in White Plains.  Yeah, that's a little...  If you're in the middle of Montana or something... 
[00:51:30]  It's illegal.  Yeah.  Oh, like he cares.  Don't worry.  You don't want to be in prison.  Yeah.  Spends a weekend in jail.  That's like a life sentence for anyone else.  Really?  It's a life sentence.  Life without any chance of parole.  Right.  Tom.  For a ticket.  Anthony and I did a little sing-along today.  You want to sing a little something for us today?  No, I tried singing along with you a little bit in the radio there, and I was like, well,  you guys shouldn't be singing along together.  I certainly am not gonna join in. 
[00:52:00]  Got a little winded.  How about you sing just a little something for us today?  You're by yourself.  It doesn't matter.  It's not like a lot of people are listening to this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's see.  I'm still standing.  I can't remember.  Oh, he's singing a little Elton John.  That's good.  Elton John, yeah.  I'm still standing.  Well, we'll play that one.  Thanks for the idea. 
[00:52:30]  You're still alive next week.  We got our next song.  Yeah, we got to challenge the crew every week.  It's gonna be a different song.  Yeah.  What, Tom?  You shouldn't keep yourself alive.  No, I'm nothing.  All right.  Give us a little more.  Yeah, Queen, keep yourself alive.  Give us a little more sing-along here.  Oh.  How about Take My Breath Away by Berlin?  Berlin, Take My Breath Away.  Thank you, stone typing guy from Pal Talk.  Oh, that's horrible.  Take my breath away.  I'm a horrible singer.  They're suggesting songs for you now. 
[00:53:00]  The Bee Gees Stayin' Alive.  Every Breath You Take by the police.  What do you want to sing today?  Oh.  I don't think you're gonna get me to do it today.  You can do it, sweetie.  Oh.  All right.  Well, Tom's alive, everybody.  That's your update.  He's going in for a test.  He's still at stage three.  And if he gets to the fourth stage,  he could possibly get a lung transplant.  That'll help him a little bit, right? 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Lung and heart.  Lung and heart.  Oh, boy.  And then you gotta hope it doesn't reject.  Yeah.  Jason from San Diego wants to challenge you to a triathlon.  Oh, well.  Let him talk.  He doesn't have much time.  I just called open Anthony.  But, Tom, go right ahead.  Right.  I'm sorry.  Now, go ahead.  Didn't interrupt.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Jason just wants to challenge you to a triathlon.  Are you up for it?  Uh, sure. 
[00:54:00]  A tricycle around some cups.  Any song by Air Supply.  You're right.  Got the Air Supply's greatest hits there.  Just pick any song.  Breathless by Madonna.  There's a Madonna fan on Pal Talk.  Machine Head by Bush.  Breathe in.  Breathe out.  Breathe in.  How about Let's Get Physical?  That's coming in from Frunkus. 
[00:54:30]  Let's get physical.  Physical.  I don't really know the words.  I want to get physical.  How about Aqualong?  I'm going to fail my physical.  I'm going to fail my physical.  Sailor Eve.  There you go.  All right.  Well, there's your update.  Tom is still alive, and we're very happy to hear that.  Thanks, guys.  Have a good weekend.  All right.  There you go.  You, too.  There goes Tom. 
[00:55:00]  We'll catch up with him next Friday, all right?  10-4.  Punch it out.  All right.  Yeah.  Living every day like it's a fly-off.  Yeah.  I feel so alive.  There's Tom from White Plains.  Good to see.  This was a stupid idea, because you know it's ending with us going to a wake.  It's going to be bad, because we're going to kind of get to know him, and he's got a  good sense of humor and everything, and then one day it's going to be like, he can't  call you.  I have to inform you, he died last night. 
[00:55:30]  Oh, great.  You couldn't.  How did it happen to old parrot lungs?  I'm going to be in front of a podium.  In the short time we knew Tom, he gave us all hope.  You know, he had a great sense of humor, even though life didn't deal him the best hand.  We didn't know Tom that long, but we just feel like we knew him our whole lives.  Tom's the kind of guy you didn't really have to know long to know Tom, because he really 
[00:56:00]  was very outward with himself.  He came across as a very funny, fun-loving guy, and that's exactly what he was.  Right.  Just a good guy who had a horrible affliction that finally took his life.  He may have had weak lungs and a weak heart, but we all know his heart was actually very  big and very strong. 
[00:56:30]  Yes.  He had weak lungs and a weak heart physically, but his spirit was big.  His spirit was big.  Thank you, Jimmy.  And let's not forget those final words from Tom.  All right.  Let's get back to Rich Voss.  Jesus, that's morbid.  Why did we start that bit?  Why?  Come on. 
[00:57:00]  This could go on for days.  When he said seven years after diagnosis, I'm thinking he found out maybe the last year.  Yeah, six years.  I'm thinking six, maybe six and a half to go.  He's got a year left.  Maybe.  Depending on what month he was diagnosed.  He'd be dead before Labor Day.  Oh, Jimmy.  What?  I'm not wishing him dead.  I'm just saying, hope you enjoyed last Christmas.  You won't be seeing this one.  Oh, God.  Tom, don't...  You won't be a pile of lumpy bones by this Christmas, kid.  Don't die Labor Day weekend. 
[00:57:30]  You're not going to get a big showing at the funeral home.  Yeah, yeah.  People have barbecues to go to police, Tom.  People are busy.  Consider us, okay?  Hang in there.  Hang in there.  Bro.  All right.  Hey, Rich Voss became a father, what, three days ago?  And we've been playing the audio here this morning.  We're up to the point where Bonnie finally gives birth.  Sorry to make people wait, but things kind of just happened here.  I don't think she gave birth yet.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah, she hasn't.  It says Bonnie gives birth in this clip.  Yeah, she's giving birth.  Yeah.  All right, here we go.  I saw she was making those sounds.  Yeah. 
[00:58:00]  Speaking of those sounds, well, it's a good line.  I'll have to stop the tape to play it to say the line from Boogie in Richmond.  What's that?  Oh.  Oh.  Lots of pressure.  Oh.  That is pressure, Brian.  Oh.  Oh.  Lots of pressure.  You hear that noise.  It's creeping everyone out.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Well, Boogie in Richmond writes, uh, Bonnie's moaning proves that the doctor's fingers are  bigger than. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  I think we get the pernt.  What was, um.  Very good, Boogie.  What was, um.  What was, wait, I forgot what I was going to say.  What was she doing that for?  No, no, no.  What was, uh, what was, uh, what was the doctor, the guy saying to her?  The pressure.  Something pressure.  The blood pressure, uh.  Oh, he wasn't talking to her.  Oh, no, no, no, no, uh.  Yeah, no, he was, uh, he was saying the blood pressure.  He was giving a report to the doctors and the nurses because he was monitoring her, monitoring 
[00:59:00]  her blood pressure.  Hey, did you go back, uh, back to Paltok real fast?  Uh, somebody had a great line.  I can't see Paltok.  All right, he's a bunch of squiggly.  E-Rock, I'm talking to you, please.  Thank you.  Uh, now went by.  Uh, wow, uh, wow.  From death to birth, One covered all, downtown Dave.  Yeah, there we go.  The circle of life.  See, we're bringing everyone back.  We're bringing them back here.  Keeping, uh, bringing, making everyone happy.  All right, let's play the clip finally.  Here's Bonnie giving birth.  He's not dead yet.  What's that? 
[00:59:30]  Oh.  Lots of pressure.  Oh.  That is pressure, Brian.  Sounds like Sandy Cain. 
[01:00:00]  This is disgusting.  It's really disgusting.  The beauty of childbirth.  This is disgusting.  This is beauty of childbirth for everybody.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  It sounds like me after a nice latte when I wake up.  For me, this is great because I never hear this noise from her.  Yeah, right?  She's having a dream that she's watching you at a comedy club, and that's her reaction after  every joke.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Ow.  Ow. 
[01:00:30]  That was quite a long setup.  I know.  Yeah.  Good point.  Good point.  Touche.  Did sound like the German guy with the chicken.  Ja.  Ja.  Oh.  Oh, das chicken.  Es gut.  Ja.  Ja.  All right, here we go.  Is she out?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Ow.  Poor Bonnie. 
[01:01:00]  Oh.  Oh.  She's out?  Yeah.  Coming out.  Here's the head.  Oh, my goodness, what's got a little head?  It's the worst.  Lots of pressure, okay?  It's a damn jelly right here.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, look at that little baby girl.  Yay.  Oh, look at that.  Five hundred people. 
[01:01:30]  Look at her.  There's the first words.  There we go.  Look at Rich is tearing up.  That's nice.  That's what I said.  That is way too personal, man.  What is wrong with you?  I don't know.  I think that's good.  What's wrong with it?  The only thing I didn't like is that you said, oh, my goodness, you old man.  Oh, my goodness.  Holy Toledo, look at it.  Goodness gracious.  I was going the baby already has a better vocabulary than me. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  That's nice.  That's beautiful.  That's what you.  Dentist.  It's not beautiful.  It's a bloody disaster.  I know.  Jesus.  It's horrible.  That was nice.  Huh?  That was nice.  Yeah.  Look, you stopped us in our tracks.  We want to beat you up.  You can't.  You can't.  That was nice.  It was nice.  Okay?  I'll admit it.  Damn it.  It was nice.  Did they have to use a scalpel or did the baby just chew its way out?  That's weird, though, going from just misery to happiness in, like, that amount of time. 
[01:02:30]  She's happy.  I guess she starts crying and stuff, you know.  Way to go, Bonnie.  She's listening today, right?  No.  Oh, that's why you were able to sneak this tape to us.  I just talked to her on the phone.  She's, you know.  She's all right with this?  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  We got another clip here.  The girl is born.  Voss's first words to her are that she is hairy.  That's what you're going to hear here. 
[01:03:00]  There you go.  Thank you.  Congratulations.  How did I shut that cap?  Hairy little girl.  Hairy little girl.  Hairy little girl.  Hairy little girl.  That's what you call Bonnie?  Terrible.  She was shaving.  The baby had so much hair. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  And we knew that because Bonnie had heartburn or something.  When you're pregnant or something, if you get, like, heartburn, they say the baby has a lot of hair.  I don't know.  It's a hairy baby.  It's creepy.  It's creepy.  The whole thing is creepy.  And I kind of looked over where they pulled the baby.  And you could see all the blood.  Because they cut her stomach.  I mean, you could see everything there.  And it did look like a scene from one of those movies.  Like Alien.  Like Alien.  Where the thing just busted out.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Or a hostel where they cut him open and just leave him laying there.  And it was just like, oh.  All right.  Well, another wafer thin mint.  Exploded.  The next clip is, uh, as Bonnie emotionally says hello to her baby for the first time.  Aw.  Vos tries to tell the doctors how to work his camera in the background.  Great.  What am I doing?  You can call a man to your wife, though.  Show it to your wife.  Oh. 
[01:04:30]  Hi.  I can't read it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Can I open?  Oh.  And it's a shower.  Oh.  I can't read it now.  Twist it right here.  Yeah.  You gotta twist it.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.  You look through that side.  Oh.  Turn it around.  Turn it around.  Twist it the other way.  Oh, shit.  Vos is just missing this wonderful moment where mother meets child for the first time. 
[01:05:00]  Bonnie's gone high to her baby.  Hi, Rina.  And then it's like, I want to start to turn it around.  Turn it around.  What you want to do.  You are terrible.  Don't you realize that this is old hat for Rich, first of all.  This is just old hat.  He's been through this a couple of times.  It's Bonnie's first.  And she's having this huge, big, personal moment.  And Rich is worried about the camera.  The creep.  You gotta turn it around. 
[01:05:30]  Turn it around, Doc.  All right.  Make sure there's not too much headroom.  How do you know I wasn't talking about the baby?  It's awful.  You're editing on the fly.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's get back to it.  Turn it around.  Turn it around.  Twist it the other way.  Oh, listen to that crap.  It's okay, baby. 
[01:06:00]  People want to know if you were selling your CDs in the recovery room.  Anthony, you just get angry when you hear babies crying.  Oh, it's just the worst sound.  It's not a beautiful sound.  It is physically annoying.  That sound isn't a pretty sound.  Maybe not for you, but I bet you're from Rich and Bonnie.  Well, of course, for a parent, it's a great sound, but I'm just talking on technical terms. 
[01:06:30]  The human ear and that sound going into it isn't like a piano being played.  Well, it's meant to get your attention.  Of course, and it does.  It gets mine, and it annoys me.  Wah!  Wah!  Wah!  Just scratch a chalkboard.  If you want to hear that sound, go to the Beacon Theater tonight.  Here's the thing.  That sound only bothers you.  Squeeze?  Yeah.  Is that a squeeze joke?  If you're on a plane or something, okay, but like in a delivery room, that sound isn't like, you know.  Well, yeah, you don't want to hear quiet in a delivery room.  You don't want to hear this.  Oh, no. 
[01:07:00]  Wait, Jimmy, do that again.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  All right.  You don't want to hear this.  That's what you're saying.  Oh, I'll hear it.  Oh, God.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That's...  Remember, Doctor?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  No, you...  Does anybody remember laughter? 
[01:07:30]  No, you want to hear the crying liver.  I don't mind the crying.  I don't mind it.  No.  It doesn't bother me yet.  All right.  Here we go.  That's what happens when a blue whale gives birth.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Stop whining.  Stop whining.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Please, your daddy.  This sucks.  The other way. 
[01:08:00]  The other way.  The other way.  You're still discussing the camera as this...  The camera.  ...brand new kid of yours.  Well, he wants to take a picture of me holding the baby next to Bonnie.  Kids 10.  No, Doc.  Turn it around.  How stupid is that doctor that he's aiming the camera to the ceiling?  Good point, man.  I think he's taken a few of these pictures before, right?  He should be an expert on it.  You know.  So you're never going to have a kid ever?  Oh.  No.  Never.  No.  Never.  I don't care about carrying on a legacy.  I don't care about kids. 
[01:08:30]  That's not in the realm of possibilities.  I want to pick up and do what I want to do when I want.  I'm a selfish, greedy person.  I could care less about global warming.  I don't care about any...  That this planet can blow up after I'm gone.  I could give a crap.  I'm here for me.  The word you're looking for is sociopath.  Anthony is sociopath.  No?  I'm a realist.  No kidding.  I am a realist.  I'm not going to sit there like the rest of you people and just keep this friggin' rock  populated for some unknown friggin' reason. 
[01:09:00]  Like we have any importance on this hurtling piece of dust through the cosmos.  What do you think?  It's important?  Do you think it's important to keep these bugs populating this planet?  It's important for you, though.  Why?  Well, because you're enjoying your life.  You said I'm enjoying it.  I'm just living it.  You're not enjoying your life?  You get moments of enjoyment.  Most of the time, you're sleeping or taking a dump.  Well, those are the enjoyable times.  That's true.  All right.  I'll give you that.  Those are the times where you have to talk to people and have intimacy. 
[01:09:30]  We're running late.  We got Tracy Morgan standing by.  We got one more clip here.  Voss makes a joke about the real mom.  Oh.  I'm so sexy.  What does she look like?  Does she look like mommy?  I don't know if she's the real mom.  Wait, what was your joke that bombed horribly? 
[01:10:00]  You're wondering who the real mom is?  Yeah.  They go, who does she look like?  I go, the real mom.  What is the real mom, though?  Obviously, she's the real mom.  Play on words.  No.  Everybody goes, who's the dad?  And I went, like, who's the mom?  But they just cut her stomach over.  But the kid finally got so uncomfortable with the silence in the room.  She had to make a noise.  The kid's already helping you out.  LOLing for you.  Here's the thing.  No matter what, have you ever had a childbirth on the air yet?  Huh?  Yes.  Actually.  No.  We've been trying to get this done for 12, 13 years. 
[01:10:30]  No.  We did play one.  We did?  I just wanted to see the look on his dumb face.  No, we haven't.  When they took the handprint of the kid, did they inadvertently grab your hand?  Speaking of who's the dad, who's the dad, we got something for you.  Iraq, you ready?  No.  Why would you?  Look at the look of horror on his face. 
[01:11:00]  Iraq, you ready?  I just see his eyes poke up, and he's like,  Come on.  Nothing you have ever seen before, and nothing you have ever heard before,  will prepare you for the shock of...  My baby is black.  Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity  in this dramatic, bold story never before told on the screen. 
[01:11:30]  I love the scream that you hear before.  All right.  We got Tracy Morgan joining the program next.  We also have to check in with Stephen Lynch.  Something went wrong with his TV appearance up there in Detroit,  and because of that, no one is allowed to do TV leading up to our big show  tomorrow night outside Detroit, the ONA Traveling Virus Comedy Show.  All right.  The only promo we can do, and they said that Lynch is going to explain it all tonight  at Borders in Birmingham, Michigan. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  Of course.  That's what Stephen said.  He said, I'm going to explain everything at the 730 book signing tonight.  I'm only passing on what Stephen faxed me.  At Borders where?  I don't want to get into it.  34-300 Woodward.  It's in Birmingham, but that's not important.  The issue is really Stephen.  Who cares about my book signing?  That's what I say to the bestsellers.  I laugh at it.  All right.  Quick break.  Tracy Morgan joins us, and of course, we'll check in with Stephen Lynch as well. 
[01:12:30]  It's Opie and Anthony.  You like this riff, Tracy, or what?  I love it.  Come on.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Tracy Morgan in studio.  He's playing Caroline's this weekend.  Air Guitar Fridays.  What's up?  Air Guitar Friday.  I got the greatest air guitar.  Yeah?  I got the greatest air guitar.  Let's hear it.  You're good?  I need to hear Kurt Cobain.  It smells like Teen Spirits. 
[01:13:00]  Teen Spirits.  There's a lot of them there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not to be confused with smells like Teen Spirits.  Hey, is Tom really going to die of lung cancer?  It's of something.  Tom, I love you, brother.  I see.  You're involved now.  I love you, Tom.  We started this dumb bit.  It was a stupid idea because now we're involved.  Now we're involved.  The listeners are involved.  We get email from people.  They're like, look, we need to know.  I'm like, ah.  And the weird part about it, he will shoot himself before the lung thing takes his life. 
[01:13:30]  That's what he says.  No, me and Bradley Lewis, we were discussing it.  We're going to take him to Sue's Rendezvous.  Yeah.  Yeah?  We're going to take him to Sue's Rendezvous before he goes.  Yeah?  Well, you better hurry.  Yes, yes.  And I'm going to try to get him on 30 Rock before he goes.  We were doing.  Really better.  Is he coughing up pieces of lung?  We were doing the math.  He's got about a year.  What?  Maybe a little less.  Oh, we got to hang out with him.  Yeah.  We got to hang out with Tom.  He's a cool guy, though, man.  And now we're involved.  If you can get me on 30 Rock, I'll give up a lung.  We got it. 
[01:14:00]  We got it.  You'd have to.  You want to hear Smells Like Teen Spirit?  Yeah, that's my joy.  Here we go.  Tracy Morgan listening to Smells Like Teen Spirit.  Oh, look at him.  He's air guitaring.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  So far, so good.  I know it's right now.  Nah, it kicks in.  You're playing like bass, bro.  No.  No, he's playing chords.  Oh, you see, yeah, he's stepping on pedals. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  He's stepping in on the pedals.  Stepping on the pedals.  All right.  Now he's doing a little sustain.  Hey, he does know.  I know this radio, but Tracy's doing a good job with the air guitar.  Air guitar Friday.  Yeah.  Do the singing part, Tracy.  Come on.  I don't know the words.  No one does.  No one really does.  See, I got it right here on my knee.  Look.  Oh, yeah.  See, he put his leg out.  Look at my wah-wah.  He's resting, and he's using...  My wah-wah.  Yeah, he's using a whammy bar and the wah-wah pedal. 
[01:15:00]  I know, hello, hello, hello, and something about a mosquito.  That's about it.  Hey, you know what, guitarists?  Huh?  I think they get laid more than bass, the guy with the ax.  Aw.  Drummers and guitars.  Women love guitar.  Drummers, you think?  Drummers, too, because he's keeping the rhythm, and he has one leg, one pants leg rolled up.  Yeah, but I think...  I'm hard on him, drummers.  Guitarists and singers are like the guys.  I'm Bon Jovi.  I know how that is.  Yeah.  I'm Bon Jovi.  Women come at me all the time, and they think they could just get in my bed, but you got 
[01:15:30]  to go through the roadies, you got to lay the whole band, then you get to bail on Bon Jovi.  I'm all the way in the back of the tour buses writing songs.  I'm sensitive.  I'm Bon Jovi.  I'm the black Bon Jovi.  They got to go through a gauntlet to get to the back of that bus.  Tupac had Thug Life tattooed on his stomach.  I'm getting the black Bon Jovi.  I might lose some street cred.  You might lose some street cred.  No, no, no.  Black Bon Jovi.  Black Bon Jovi.  My street cred is intact. 
[01:16:00]  I don't know about that.  Me and Jim, we roll with Rush.  We certainly do.  I hang out outside the cellar.  Yeah.  What about Rush doing Roll the Bones?  There's a little rap in that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  See?  Very little.  Tracy knows.  It's awful.  Tracy knows.  Hey, did you hear Rich Voss' audio of his wife giving birth there?  I got excited about that.  You got excited?  Why?  Yeah.  This is the thing with me and pregnant women.  It's one time he doesn't have to pay child support.  She was moaning and groaning. 
[01:16:30]  I'm old school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like she's being punished.  Wasn't that something kind of exciting about hearing Bonnie moan?  That's why I watched porno.  You know?  Even in pain.  The punishment.  Yeah.  You know?  Even in pain.  There was something kind of cool about her moaning.  Well, you know, I love pregnant women anyway.  You know, I love to watch a pregnant woman anyway because then you know that somebody left  it in.  Wow.  Somebody left it in.  And that right there in itself is exciting because it's 2007. 
[01:17:00]  You can't leave it in.  You can't even go raw.  I know.  I love raw.  Your philosophy is a bit different.  That's what excites you.  I'm an old schooler.  I love raw.  By the way, the morning-  I can't watch porno when they use condoms.  I'll be like, ah, that's whack.  Why would you?  Both guys are safe.  It's like, yeah.  It's whack.  It's whack.  Guess what, Jim?  I did a movie, an independent movie with Olivia O' Lovely.  Was she a porn girl?  Latin Booty Talk 29. 
[01:17:30]  Latin.  Latin Booty Talk 29.  They're up to 29.  Yeah.  I left that series after 27.  I felt the art direction became sloppy.  Are you serious?  Yes.  Latin Booty Talk.  Too much makeup.  Too much glamour.  Yeah.  It was just very poorly directed.  No stretch marks.  It was no good.  Whack.  They're really up to 29 of those.  Yeah.  My God.  No, they're up to like 36.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  37 is being filmed today.  Yeah.  And it's done.  My son. 
[01:18:00]  My oldest son be watching my porn, man.  Really?  How old is he now?  He's ashamed to admit it, but I know he has, because I know where I left the tape.  How old is he now?  He's like 21.  Oh, okay.  He's itching against them, too.  He's itching.  You make a good point, though.  You know where you left the tape.  I know where I left it.  I know what woman I left it on.  Well, we've talked about this on the show.  You watch porn 10, 15 minutes at a time, so you know where you left off.  Man, I got many screens going on.  I'm getting cake.  I work with y'all.  What do you got, like Scarface security screens with just porno playing on it? 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  Pick and choose which one you want to get.  My wife is so mad at me, man.  Women get so mad because, you know, you try to hide it all over the place, and she found  one of my daughter's Easy Bake Oven.  You hid it in there?  Yeah.  Then I took the label off and put Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on it, and my nephew was  watching it, and it blew his mind.  She said, you might end up like Ted Bundy.  He's being exposed too early. 
[01:19:00]  She found one of them pornos in my daughter's Easy Bake Oven.  People freak out when the kids accidentally see porno.  It's educational.  If somebody screws up down at Blockbuster.  Remember when people used to return, like, porno tapes and put it in, like, the kid's  section, Disney movies?  And then they'd rent it out, pop it in, and the parent would leave.  They'd hear some strange noises come into the room, and the kid is just sitting there,  eyes wide open, just staring at hardcore pornography. 
[01:19:30]  And then they'd want to sue.  They'd want to freak out.  Just leave the kid alone.  Don't make a big deal about it.  Let him finish the movie.  It's better than American Idol.  Yeah.  American Idol leads people down a wrong path.  You know, because what's karaoke without the booze, man?  That's pretty much what it is.  That's whack.  Karaoke without the booze.  Saying that you should be able to drink on American Idol.  American Idol, man.  Let's see what's really going on. 
[01:20:00]  You know, you do sound better after a few beers.  That would be a great deal.  When you're doing karaoke.  Let's see who got talent.  There's a curve, though.  A few beers, you sound good, good, good, good.  One beer, too many.  Wham!  It drops.  It drops off.  Let's see who got talent.  And you sound like crap.  But that's when it gets to be good TV.  To watch.  Let them drink as much as they want, do a karaoke show.  You do karaoke?  Have they done a karaoke?  Somebody's pulling a tan out.  Have they done a karaoke reality show yet?  They've tried that one, too.  Yeah.  I wouldn't get into it.  Nah.  They did something, I think, on MTV or something. 
[01:20:30]  Too many ringers.  Remember putting on the hits?  American Idol was ringers.  Putting on the hits.  Yeah.  What the hell was the gist of that?  Hey, so Hot Rod was here yesterday?  The guy with lip sync?  Yeah.  He got Hot Rod here yesterday?  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm messing up.  Those two is a...  Yeah, we're just having a conversation.  Those two are talking and then...  What was that song, Putting on the Hits, from the 80s?  The show was Putting on the Hits.  If you're blue and you don't know what to go to, I don't...  No, that's Putting on the Ritz.  Putting on the Hits was a show, I think.  Was that what it was called?  Was the guy with lip sync?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:21:00]  He was a blonde boy?  Yeah, it was a lip syncing show.  It was awful.  He was trying to be funny.  It was a blonde boy and a black dude.  Was it?  No, I just made that up.  Oh.  He was just guessing.  Yeah, we had Hot Rod guy in two days ago.  Andy.  Andy was in here, Sandberg.  They ripped him a new a-hole today in the papers, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, the movie got one star today.  We were hoping that he would get a little better review than that.  See?  Andy, next time, put me in it, brother.  Oh. 
[01:21:30]  Oh.  Oh.  You know I'm the black utility guy.  Uh-oh.  That was my role on SNL.  You're the go-to.  Yeah, but you started...  I was the utility guy.  You started getting characters.  I got clean up.  Yeah.  Brian Fellow.  Yeah, I started getting characters.  I started to get...  I became a franchise.  Yep.  It's about franchise, brother.  I don't like that bird.  No, that bird got devil eyes.  That bird took my credit card.  And he just holed up the rubber boobie we have here.  Yeah, we got those from Jill. 
[01:22:00]  Jill Nicolini brought those in for us.  So, by the way...  Is this like a real one?  That's one that they kind of stick in the bra.  Yeah.  They don't put that under the skin.  Booty Talk's up to 77.  Booty Talk's 77?  They got 77 of them.  77.  Oh, you got to get into that series, man.  That series is awesome.  Yeah.  Yo, I went to the Bunny Ranch.  You did?  Yeah.  We sent some of our listeners there.  Weren't you in here last time?  Yeah, when homeboy got on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he got lifted?  He got lifted a little bit, right? 
[01:22:30]  That was the time before.  But this last time, we took two guys that are having marital problems and shipped them  off to the Bunny Ranch to get some action.  One guy hadn't had sex with his wife for 12 years.  12?  Yeah.  12 years.  And his wife, we got her on the phone and she was just like, I don't care.  I don't want it.  I don't need it.  And we're like, well, you know something?  Your husband does.  And we're talking for the Bunny Ranch.  What happens to people?  What happens to the ladies when they stop wanting to put out? 
[01:23:00]  I don't know.  I'm gone, man.  If my marriage ever goes south like that, my love life ever.  See, you got to role play.  You shouldn't have to pay.  You got to role play, man.  I mean, you got to role play.  You got to keep it creative.  Like, I bought my wife a Girl Scout outfit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I told her to go outside.  I bought her the wig, you know, and two ponytails.  Then I told her to go outside and knock on the door and try to sell me some cookies.  I'm going to come to the door with my boxes and my junk hanging out. 
[01:23:30]  She committed, too.  She was like, man, so you want to buy some butter crunch cookies?  And I was like, yeah, come on in here.  I'm going to get a couple of boxes from you.  I'm going to buy a couple of boxes.  And then after we, after I laid there, we ate the cookies, you know?  Really went the distance, got the cookies and everything.  It'd be funny if you just bought the cookies in Central Lake.  My homeboy played, he played, he played with his girlfriend.  They played a game called rape.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, some people are into that fantasy.  He said his woman want him to take it by force.  Yeah.  That's her thing.  She likes to take it by force.  That is a fetish that some women have.  I'm going to stick to the Girl Scouts.  We've taken a lot of calls about that very subject over the years.  It's odd because the actual thing, the actual crime is such a violent thing.  But there are some women that fantasize about that.  He told me, yeah.  He told me, I looked at him like he was crazy.  He told me that this is what his lady likes. 
[01:24:30]  They just want to be taken.  They don't want the violence of rape.  They only want the idea of being sexualized and used and being against their will.  But they don't want the violence of it.  It's just about having sex against your will.  Yeah, but what guy, like, it would be, I think it would be odd to find two.  I think the guy sometimes is the woman.  I love that.  Yeah, but I think it would be odd if the woman's into it to actually find the guy into it would  be a hell of a coincidence.  Yeah, I'm not with that, man.  I'm not with only that.  Nah, nah.  Take him off.  I'm a finesse type of guy.  That guy almost tells me she wants somebody else. 
[01:25:00]  When I have sex with my woman, I don't bang.  You know, I'm more of a grind.  I'm old school.  I'm a grind.  Yeah.  I'm a grind.  You got some slow pimping moves.  I need to get wet, moaning, and groaning.  Hey, could you put Richard's Voices of the Pregnancy on while I grind?  You want to hear, Bonnie?  Let me grind to it.  All right, hold on.  Hold on.  Let me help out Tracy here today.  Let me grind to it, yo.  There's a difference when you bang and then when you grind.  This is a turn on to Tracy.  I got to do it.  I'm sorry, Rich.  Bonnie giving birth here. 
[01:25:30]  In the meantime, we'll just have Bob Kelly moaning.  Here we go.  What's that?  Where was y'all in the kitchen or something?  No, we're white.  He's like, I have pots being banged.  Yeah.  Easy bake fryer going on.  Well, my wife gave birth to all my sons, man.  What she would do is she's like so experienced. 
[01:26:00]  Like if I wasn't there, like if I was at my girlfriend's house while she was going into contractions,  then her mother would call me like, wake me up at like six in the morning.  I'd be in the bed with my girlfriend.  She'd be like, yo, why?  Hey, you better get over here.  Your wife is going into contractions.  Now I'd be like, oh, oh, well.  I'd jump up and put my pants on.  And my girlfriend would be like, where you going?  I'd be like, my wife is having birth. 
[01:26:30]  She's giving birth.  Did you grab the Girl Scout cookies?  Here's the thing about role playing.  You ever do role playing and you become a character and she's a character, but then  she asks for that character the next time and you get jealous of the character that you  are.  You know, you have Tom one night and the next time she goes, where's Tom?  And you're going, what's Tom got that I don't have?  You want her to be someone and she just wants you to be someone with a high school diploma.  It gets complex, man. 
[01:27:00]  Here's Bonnie giving birth there, Tracy.  Play along to this.  Yeah.  She said, ah.  That's where you hit that spot.  That's how like Booty Talk 29 right there.  I'm taking that home with me.  No you're not.  Is she out? 
[01:27:30]  Turn it off.  I see childbirth, man.  I thought you said that turned you on.  What happened?  You told me to turn it off.  Just a, oh.  I got a rod.  Is that wrong?  Is that wrong?  Jesus.  Jim.  Jim is hard, man.  All right.  He's really hard, man.  All right.  I think.  This dude is spooky, man.  Yeah.  He is really creepy.  They probably dumped out of it there, Tracy, but they got it on the other side. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  That's something.  Jimmy, for some reason, had something going on while we were playing that audio.  I don't even want to know.  Hey, Tom's going to take you up on your offer, Tracy.  It's Tom from White Plains once again.  Of course, it's Is Tom Alive Friday.  We found out that Tom is alive, and he's calling back here.  Tom, what's up?  Hey.  I was asking Tracy.  I'll take him up on his offer for 30 Rock.  And there was a... 
[01:28:30]  You okay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm just catching my breath and thought.  Oh.  Oh.  Damn.  Those lungs are a curse, aren't they?  I actually wasn't expecting you to get on, but...  Oh, yeah.  I got some x-rays to email you, so you can put them up on the site.  Of your lungs?  Of my lungs.  Yeah.  Really? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  Of my lungs.  Yeah, this guy's a trooper.  It's unbelievable.  Do you have an email address to send it to?  Uh, I got...  I got a...  I got your email address, uh...  All right.  Be on the lookout for Tom's x-ray, so we can throw it up on the website.  Looks like two edamame just hanging.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Two bats hanging upside down.  Sleeping.  Poor guy. 
[01:29:30]  Thanks, Tracy.  Thank you, Tom.  When are you filming 30 Rock again, Tracy?  I'm going to have to love.  Right on.  Stay alive, baby.  I thought that was very nice.  Just stay alive.  All right, parrot lungs.  We'll talk to you next week.  Well, explain to Tracy, though, when you realize that all hope is lost, what are you going  to do?  Oh, it's simple.  I'll just blow my head off.  Well, the one good body part you have, you want to...  Yeah, I'd shoot those lungs. 
[01:30:00]  Who could blame the guy, by the way?  Huh?  What's that?  I don't blame you.  I'm all for, you know, taking control of your death.  Thank you for supporting me.  What?  Thank you for supporting me.  Right after his head gets...  I appreciated that.  Right after his head gets splattered on the wall, you hear his phone recording going  on off.  We have the lung for you.  Oh, God.  Oh, would that be awful?  Tom, good news. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  Oh.  Oh.  Hold on there.  All right.  Hi, Tom.  It's the hospital.  Look, good news.  We have a lung and a heart that is completely compatible.  Really looking forward.  Please get back to us immediately.  You know how time-sensitive this can be.  And, wow, this is just going to start a whole new life for you.  We're so happy here at the hospital. 
[01:31:00]  Get in touch with us as quickly as possible, okay?  What's that in the background?  Oh, I hope that's him coming to the hospital.  And it's not just the hospital calling.  It's like all kind of stuff starts good.  Yeah.  Good stuff will start.  Yeah.  He wins the lottery.  Lauren Michaels calls.  Lauren Michaels.  We got a spot for you on 30 Rock.  Hi, Tom? 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you're still alive.  You just wrecked the pit, Tom.  Hold on.  Okay.  All right.  We took care of Tom.  Go ahead.  You missed.  All right.  There you go.  There we go.  Hi, Tom.  A whole new life is going to be right around the corner for you.  So happy.  Tragically, somebody had to die for this, but the lungs and heart are waiting for you, my  friend, you.  The wait is over.  Before you know it, you're going to be riding bikes, having sex with women, whatever it 
[01:32:00]  takes, breathing.  Hello.  Tom?  Ben from Halifax, he writes, shock to the heart and Tom's to blame.  He gives lungs a bad name.  Lungs.  For little lungs.  Is that like from cigarette smoking?  Tom, how'd you get this damn thing?  They don't know.  Oh, no.  Just one of those like, it's like. 
[01:32:30]  No.  Genetic?  No.  Genetic.  Why?  Did somebody in your family have it?  And.  Okay.  I forgot it.  There was a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, uncle Frank, uh, like in my, my grandmother's  brother or something that had some kind of a lung problem.  Right.  But it was, but they didn't know, they didn't diagnose it.  Right.  This is like six degrees.  But, uh, you know, he had all the same symptoms as I have. 
[01:33:00]  All right, Tom.  Hey, when you blow out your birthday cake candles, is it your next birthday already?  Just curious.  No, I just ask for the big letters.  I would give him those candles that don't blow out and then watch him just go face first into the cake.  He has to hold a fan up.  Make a wish and he holds his fan up.  It's not even a secret what you wished for. 
[01:33:30]  We all know, right?  All of a sudden, a big lung shows up on the table.  This guy, buddy, outlive all of us.  Yeah, no kidding.  Outlive all of us.  Chester's liver writes, it's genetic.  His father was a parrot.  This Chester liver never has anything funny.  All right, Tom.  Tom.  Yes.  Oh, God, Tom.  What are you doing?  You can't do that to us.  Tom.  No delays like that.  No delays ever, okay, if we're going to continue this bit. 
[01:34:00]  No problem.  All right, Tom.  What do you want?  No, I was just making sure you were still alive.  We'll talk to you next Friday, okay?  10-4.  All right.  I'll leave my email once.  That's when he's dying.  10-4.  October the 4th.  0-7.  Oh, no.  You know they're going to start betting now.  He just started something.  The over-under.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Bet.  Well, Tom, we look forward to the x-rays, and we'll talk to you next Friday, hopefully. 
[01:34:30]  Punching out.  All right.  For now.  For now, you should say.  Punching out for now.  For now.  All right.  It's Is Tom Alive Friday, and yes, he is alive.  More with Tracy Morgan playing Carolines all weekend long.  2-1-2.  Yeah.  7-5-7.  4-100.  And after the break, we've got to talk to Stephen Lynch, because something went horribly wrong  with his TV appearance yesterday, and we'll get into it.  It affects everybody.  Yeah, exactly.  It's Opie and Anthony.  877-212-ON-A.  Right after the show, we're going to Detroit. 
[01:35:00]  Detroit.  Yeah.  Got a big comedy show Saturday, and Tracy Morgan's in the studio.  That's going to be sweet, man.  I wish I was dead.  Yeah, what happened?  What happened?  I got to do Dirty Rock and all of that stuff and get ready to get up for that.  But I've been on the road with y'all, man.  That's rock and roll, baby.  Isn't it?  I'm a comedian, man, and not many comedians get to play in front of 25,000.  I like how the number keeps going up.  Oh, I know.  Bob Saget on Leno last night goes, ah, 15, 20. 
[01:35:30]  Now we're up to 25,000 people.  You remember when we was in Philly and Camden?  It was like 30,000.  Say 30,000.  Pretty soon the Pope is going to be open for us.  Right.  We're heading toward Woodstock numbers.  Keep it up, Tracy.  It's sweet.  Yeah, but you're in town, New York, Caroline's, all weekend long.  Yeah.  And I love seeing your comedy there, Tracy.  No doubt.  You always come to a hangout with me.  I try.  You always come to a hangout with me.  I definitely try.  Yeah, hey, do you be laughing?  You're laughing at the Easy Break Oven joke this time. 
[01:36:00]  That struck me.  Yeah, you've seen everything.  You've seen everything.  You don't laugh at everything.  You don't laugh at everything.  You've seen every trick in the book.  Right, right.  Yeah.  I try to be original.  Come on, porno inside of an Easy Break Oven.  We got to talk about the paper in your pocket.  That was a little creepy to me as a white boy.  Yeah.  As a white boy, that was a little creepy.  That's commonplace in the ghetto.  I thought it was an episode of Maury.  Yeah.  I'm like, whoa.  That's all Maury.  When did we turn into Maury?  I was young.  I was young.  I was kink. 
[01:36:30]  I was frisky.  Frisky.  Yeah, I was frisky.  And I met this young lady and we did it.  And she thought that the baby was mine.  So I was on a previous radio station yesterday and she called the radio station and tried  to make me look like a deadbeat dad.  Ooh.  But I got the paternity test in my pocket, so she hung up the phone, you know?  Carry around paternity tests like we carry around our license. 
[01:37:00]  I carry a paternity test.  Let me explain, though, because she's been after you for the kid's now, what, 19?  Yeah.  The kid's now 19.  And gangbanging.  And he's a gang member.  I'm scared.  Yeah, you should be.  I got to watch my back in this city.  You should.  Damn.  She's been after you for 19 years.  She will not let it go.  To the point that Tracy Morgan carries around the paternity test in his pocket.  There it is.  It says 0.0 chance of being in the phone.  You see there was a one there that he just put white out over? 
[01:37:30]  Hey, wait a minute.  This looks like 100% to me.  What do you got going on here, Tracy?  She told the judge, no, he was my first.  Is this really the paternity?  That's it.  The fraud?  And you got to pay me.  She told, my mother said, you better carry your paternity test around.  Right, right.  That's what my mother said.  Now you carry your own results around.  You hear me?  You carry them results.  Do you have anything even close to that in your wallet? 
[01:38:00]  It's like.  I think the craziest.  Yeah.  What do you got?  Don't even show me the picture of your unit.  No, yeah.  That gag is old.  Not that old gag.  We're all onto that gag, you idiot.  I knew he was pulling that out.  Rich carries a picture of his unit in his wallet because he took a pill and it looked  really, really good.  So he decided he needed to photograph it.  And he goes, you want to see a picture of my kid?  And he gives it to you and you look at it and you're just looking at it.  Yeah, yeah.  This is what we.  He's so proud.  This is the treat that is Rich Voss.  This is what we get to do. 
[01:38:30]  There's the Tracy.  Oh, Rich, since we're all showing photos.  You know, Rich, you're a good kid.  He took a pill?  Yeah.  He said, wow, this is looking all right.  I got to take a picture of this.  Oh, Jimmy.  I think it's true that you try.  Yo, let me see.  He wants to see it.  Look, he's grabbing at it.  I look like a baby arm.  Baby, I'm holding a can of soup.  It's on Jimmy's iPhone.  And it's the picture he uses when I call. 
[01:39:00]  That pops up on his screen.  Thanks.  Why?  There's no Nazi helmet on it.  I don't think that's why they invented the iPhone.  For you to take pictures of your junk.  I just put your real picture there, Anthony.  Oh, okay.  He's showing the pal talk.  All right, listen.  Hey, we got Stephen Lynch on the phone.  There's a bit of controversy going on.  We're heading to Detroit right after the show today. 
[01:39:30]  The big show's tomorrow night.  And Stephen Lynch, you know, it's his hometown.  He was up there early.  He did some TV yesterday.  Lynch.  Hey, guys.  Got a lot of email yesterday about you.  You know what?  Let me say that I am sick to death about this entire incident.  And I've been up all night.  I haven't slept.  And I want to apologize to you guys.  And I don't want to, you know, I think I Mercurio-ed you guys in Detroit.  And I didn't mean it.  Are you kidding me?  We love this.  Well, this was what was set up. 
[01:40:00]  Stephen Lynch did an interview for Fox in Detroit.  And then Jimmy was going to do an interview.  All revolving around our tour, of course.  And Ant and I were going to do one.  And then we were going to get a whole bunch of comedians to do one.  And they were going to just be doing TV all weekend long while we were up there.  And Lynch was the first guy.  And I ruined it.  I ruined it for everybody.  He was the first guy.  He went on TV.  He sang a song.  I heard it killed.  Everyone was laughing.  You know, the behind-the-scenes guys.  And then walk us through it.  Well, first of all, what song was it?  Well, wait a minute.  It didn't, you know, let me clarify.  It wasn't, I didn't exactly kill. 
[01:40:30]  It wasn't a great performance.  You know, this is Fox News.  And it's on at 11 a.m. or something.  And it's one of those sort of cheesy news shows.  You know, where they go,  A hundred people died in the bridge accident today.  Now Stephen Lynch is going to sing a hilarious song for you.  And you kind of go, uh, okay.  And honestly, I didn't even want to do it.  But, you know, I live a half an hour from this place.  And, you know, I want to sell some tickets to the show.  So I drove there.  And nobody seemed to know what I was going to do or what was going on. 
[01:41:00]  And I kept asking the guy, you know, am I singing?  Or is this just an interview?  And he said, yeah, yeah, you know, sing a song.  And I said, well, what do you want me to sing?  And he said, you know, just pick something.  I said, okay, well, what can't I say?  And he's like, you know, just, you know, don't use profanity and you'll be fine.  I went, well, you know, I don't know if you're aware of what I do,  but my material is not exactly TV friendly.  He's like, yeah, don't worry about it.  As long as you don't swear.  Yeah, don't worry about it.  Whatever you want.  I went, all right.  And so I did the interview and launched into just one verse of one song 
[01:41:30]  and stopped because I felt sort of an iciness in the air after I said this particular word.  What was the word?  Can you say it on the radio?  Yes, you can.  I don't know.  Well, it's a bunch of guys who might live in a submarine, let's say.  Like, homos?  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I'm talking about, right?  The old C.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:42:00]  You could say semen.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're talking about the...  All right, well, I said semen, you know, which I, you know, in retrospect,  is probably not the best choice of words, but, you know, people were laughing  and it seemed to go okay, and then they pounced on me afterwards  and essentially led me out of the building.  Wow.  That's how they're doing.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  All right, so they go to commercial.  Did they go to commercial abruptly?  I don't remember.  It's all a blur to me.  It's a big blur.  Dude, you're in the books, man. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, you're in the books.  So then what?  They go to commercial and they just escort you out?  Yeah, well, somebody, some PA or something came up to me and said,  we've decided to cancel your second half and just sort of walked away.  And I went, oh, okay.  Oh, no.  That's cool.  And, you know, nobody, not only did they not escort me,  nobody really even looked at me or talked to me after that.  I had to kind of make my way out of the building.  Oh, phonies.  Yeah, you're cool.  What a bunch of phony jackasses. 
[01:43:00]  That's cool.  That's good comedy.  Dude, did they say, we'll be back with more of Stephen Lynch?  Oh, yeah.  They said that and then they...  The anchors loved it.  She got a big kick out of it.  You know, another thing that I did, which is probably stupid,  is at the very top of the segment,  she mentioned that I was Tony nominated for The Wedding Singer.  And I reminded her that I didn't win,  and I mouthed sons of bitches, you know, shaking my fist. 
[01:43:30]  But I mouthed it.  I didn't say it.  I didn't mouth it.  And, you know, so maybe that combined with the, you know, semen talk.  Dude, how uncomfortable was it?  It was...  I thought I did great until, you know...  No, but I mean...  When you stop talking to me.  When you realize everyone stopped talking to you,  no one's looking you in the eye,  and you're sitting there with your guitar.  Taking the walk of shame out of the building.  How uncomfortable was it?  The perp walk.  Honestly, my first thought was sweet.  I can, you know, I don't have to wait around for another half an hour.  I can just leave.  All right.  But, you know, and then as I'm making the walk, I'm thinking, 
[01:44:00]  what...  Uh-oh.  Aren't there other interviews that they're supposed to be doing  with people on this virus?  That's correct.  Well, they fired off an email ASAP there,  and, yeah, canceled everything.  We don't want vulgar people on our program.  They want everybody to be like Ray Romano or something.  I don't know, man.  Everybody's supposed to be politically correct now.  But you got to understand...  I feel bad about it, but I think, you know...  It's probably a fair representation of, you know, what you would get... 
[01:44:30]  Hey, Lynch...  If you came to this show, you know what I mean?  This is a show for children, obviously, so...  We think it's hilarious, man.  We're trying to get the video so we can play it in front of everybody tomorrow night.  And go, look, they kicked them off TV for this,  and then show everybody how ridiculous it is.  Oh, we'd have been screwed.  It was ridiculous.  We'd have been screwed just thinking about you doing, you know,  saying semen in a song and mouthing the word son of a bitch without actually saying it.  If we went on there, they'd have thrown us out mid-interview. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, I can't even think what you guys would even talk about.  Yeah.  Right, right.  And this is Fox, by the way.  Hello.  Yeah.  They show some horrific news every single day,  but your little song is going to be the problem, right?  Well, it pissed one guy off, I think.  Everybody else seemed to sort of enjoy it, but...  Who's the guy, Steve, do you know?  What's that?  Who's the guy, do you know?  I have no idea.  We used to send them some tickets to the show. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, there you go.  Sure would love it.  And they gave away tickets to the show as well, so...  Oh.  Very cool.  They'll be doing that all week.  Well, Steve, I switched my flight to get there on time to do TV and radio tomorrow, so thanks.  Oh, no, well, I live here, so it was no big deal.  I had a big signing that's probably going to be affected by it tonight.  Yeah.  James, I will personally buy hundreds of copies of your books.  I'm lying, because I wouldn't have been on TV until tomorrow, the signings tonight.  It wouldn't have affected it.  Yes. 
[01:46:00]  Unless I would have said, hope you came last night.  I don't know if we would have LOL'd.  But a TV appearance would have helped Anthony and I as far as our ratings go in Detroit.  Yeah.  Maybe next time.  Would it have?  There's always ABC.  Yeah, there's always...  Lance, don't you worry at all, man.  I think that's hilarious.  Yeah, I read that, and I was laughing.  I thought it was really funny.  I was really up all night worrying about it.  We're trying to get the video.  I was up all night, but I was playing poker.  Drinking a few beers. 
[01:46:30]  All right, Lynch, we'll see you tomorrow, okay?  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Cool, man.  Steven Lynch, everyone.  We're trying to find the video.  If someone has it, we really want it for the venue tomorrow night.  That's great.  All right.  Goddamn people.  Give me a break.  Huh?  Who are the comedians?  Oh, yeah, Mancia's doing this one, and Lynch, myself, you, Patrice, Otto and George, stupid  Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  Bob Saget.  Go to VirusTour, one word on MySpace for all the details.  Mancia, Saget, and Lynch.  I don't know who Mancia is.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Mancia.  It's brought to you by Bud Light, always worth it.  Tickets still available.  The headline, if you've got a military ID, you get them free tomorrow.  Just show your ID at the door.  And, yes, the One Village is going to be a good one.  We've got Sideshow Benny doing stuff.  Sideshow Benny?  The Sideshow Benny.  Wow.  We'll be signing his book in the One Village before the show.  Got some WWE representation.  We've got the girls from the Pantheon in Dearborn, Michigan doing some dancing for everybody  in the village and on the stage. 
[01:47:30]  Dearborn, Michigan girls.  Nice.  What happened?  I don't know.  How hot are the Dearborn, Michigan girls?  Are they hot?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  All right.  They have to be hot.  All right.  More with Tracy Morgan.  I've lived through Long Island Day Strippers.  Anything looks hot on a stage after you've tossed a buck or two to Long Island Day Strippers.  Yeah.  You walk out of the place like Frankenstein.  The sun hits your eyes. 
[01:48:00]  It's just noon.  Friend.  It's bright.  You make that quick turn to the parking lot.  Because you don't want the cars passing by on the street to see you.  Look at that pervert coming out of the place.  Nothing worse than leaving a Long Island Strip Club.  It's when it's still bright out.  It's one in the afternoon for Christ.  One in the afternoon.  He's drinking and looking at boobies.  I'm at a peep booth that early.  I'm going to wipe your chin off.  I know. 
[01:48:30]  Everybody's going to work.  You just finished.  Hey, why don't we do a little Stephen Lynch song as we go to break here.  It's Opie and Anthony with Tracy Morgan, Jim Norton, and of course, Rich Voss.  She got a smile.  Yeah, she got a smile and she's flashing it right at me.  She got a wink, a wink across the bar and I know that it's meant to be. 
[01:49:00]  She got a walk, ooh, she walking over and I think it could be my day.  She got a friend, ooh, she got a friend.  Now, why's she standing in her way?  It's a big, fat friend.  Oh, God, there's always one.  Big, fat friend.  To wreck my f***ing fun.  Now, baby, baby, baby, if it's boots you want to knock, leave your chubby friend at home because she's going to block the cat. 
[01:49:30]  Now, I'm afraid of no man with any I'll contend, but I cannot compete with your big, fat friend.  Big, fat friend.  So, big, fat friend, we meet again.  You will not leave her alone.  You roll your eyes, make sarcastic comments while you're sucking on a chicken bone. 
[01:50:00]  But that's okay.  You think you won the battle, but I tend to disagree.  See, I know you and your Achilles heel and he's sitting next to me.  It's my non-discriminating friend.  So what's that, your account?  Non-discriminating friend.  I'll nail you anyhow.  Yeah, I know he smells like whiskey and he's had a couple rounds. 
[01:50:30]  With every shot of Jaeger, hey, you lose a couple pounds.  Now, baby, baby, baby, bring the evening to an end.  Just you and me and my pal.  And your big, fat friend.  Woo!  Yeah!  Thank you very much.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  Well, Tracy, I got one question for you.  What's up, my friend?  Why is your shirt off?  Because that's the only move I got left.  What the hell's going on with you today? 
[01:51:00]  This body used to be the body of an Adonis.  Right, right.  This right here is years of abuse.  Stretch marks in and out.  But why were you taking your shirt off and showing everybody?  Because people need to see this.  Yeah.  Why?  Because this is a work of art.  It's a work of art.  Why?  This is years and years of abuse.  Uh-huh.  And coronas.  Coronas.  And it's the, like you said, the only move he's got left.  That's the only move I got left.  Is to take the shirt off. 
[01:51:30]  That's the only move I got left.  Where are you going?  I'm taking power back.  But I heard you reference 50 Cent.  Yeah, he take his shirt off.  People bow down.  Right.  I take my shirt off.  They want to kick me out the club.  That's a body of a life.  I'm asking 21 questions.  What, boss?  This is years.  This is years.  This is years of abuse.  In and out of abusive relationships.  So 50 Cent can get away with walking around clubs without a shirt on.  You can. 
[01:52:00]  My glory days are over.  And that pisses you off, right?  My glory days are over.  I probably could run a 4.8 in the 40s.  I probably still got a 4.8.  But you know what?  I got that juco knee.  What's that?  That juco knee.  That junior college injury.  I played Division 14 football.  In the parking lot.  I pulled a hamstring.  I put monkey ligaments in my knee.  I played football when the helmets was leather.  Holler at me. 
[01:52:30]  And then you said you don't go to the gym.  I'm old school, man.  I don't wear drawers.  I'm old school.  I don't wear drawers.  I wear jock straps.  Jock straps.  I wear jocks.  Yeah.  What about the vitamin water?  You said you don't.  I don't mess with vitamin water.  No?  My junk is so big they had it on Brian Gumbel.  Why?  They had my junk on real sports.  What the hell does that mean?  When I get ready to have sex, the Godzilla music come on. 
[01:53:00]  Ba-na-na-na.  Ba-na-na-na-na-na.  Ba-na-na-na.  Little Chinese dude with a helmet and white gloves go,  please clear the streets.  Godzilla is coming.  Please clear the streets.  Godzilla is coming.  Godzilla is coming.  Ba-na-na-na.  Ba-na-na-na-na-na.  Remember Mothra?  Mothra? 
[01:53:30]  He's very proud of it, I guess.  My junk.  Big.  Somewhere your ankle bracelet's going off.  You know, some people, you know, sometimes women,  when a man is unsurcumcised, don't be mad over him.  He was just overlooked that day.  Just overlooked, that's all it is?  He was overlooked because sometimes you put your junk out  and it got, you know, it got that leg warmer on it, you know?  It looked like Leroy from Fame, you know?  Oh, dude.  It looks like it.  Fame! 
[01:54:00]  I want to live forever!  He looks like Leroy from Bill Cosby cartoon.  Who's Cosby?  Bill Cosby.  It looks like one of those Cosby kids from Fat Albin.  It does look Cosby.  Bill Cosby.  You uncircumcised, it looked like the guy from the Cosby kids.  It was like...  Mushmout.  Mushmout.  Well, you uncircumcised, it looked like an open bag of potato chips, you know?  A garage with no door on it.  Yeah. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I know you miss Jim.  I know you miss me backstage over there.  There you go.  I can read.  Yeah.  You want to be famous?  This is where it starts.  Leroy, remember Fame?  They don't make TV like this.  Gene Anthony, right.  You know, and my balls, you know, my testicles got leotards. 
[01:55:00]  When I pop those out, he goes, she's a maniac, maniac.  I don't have big testicles, but I got two scoops of raisins.  I'm going to get a deal with Kellogg's.  Hey, Rich, I'm going to get a deal with Kellogg's.  Tracy's going to be a Caroline's. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Better get ready.  Caroline's this weekend here in New York City.  What, Jimmy?  We've got to ask Tracy.  When you've got big junk, you stink up the room.  I haven't.  I like that aroma.  It smells like sex and right guard and medics, double mint gum and Marlboro lights.  We've got to ask you about another radio station incident. 
[01:56:00]  There's times like you'll make the news and I just realize that I love you.  And one of those times was in Miami and I'm like, what happened?  It was an incident.  It was an incident that got resolved.  It was a misunderstanding that got resolved.  That's it.  That's the whole thing?  Mm-hmm.  All right.  What happened?  That's a good story.  Sexual harassment or something?  I don't know.  I don't know if there's any...  I don't know.  Was there touching or something?  She claimed touching?  It was just a thing.  It was just a thing?  A hug?  Yes.  Everybody don't dig my shtick. 
[01:56:30]  Somebody, a woman, misunderstood Tracy's humor as being real.  Right, right.  That's the streets of San Francisco.  We're called Molden.  I love that song.  Michael Douglas.  That's when they had the little Slub No 38s.  Yeah.  By the way, Mike from Minnesota, he's pointing out that the Fame song we just played, that  certainly isn't Tom's song. 
[01:57:00]  Fame, I'm going to...  Oh, I'm going to live forever.  I want to live forever.  All right, listen to Tracy.  We got a part of that movie, by the way, is when Irene Karras crying with those awful  breasts.  Yo, you know I'm going to hell, right?  Why?  You scrapped to it?  I used to masturbate to Watchtower magazines.  Watchtower?  The Jehovah Witness come, the Jehovah Witness come, knock on your door and leave the magazine  right there.  What is in there that you could possibly...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I see Eve naked.  All right, hold on.  They dumped out.  So you used to take care of yourself to the Watchtower magazine? 
[01:57:30]  Yeah.  What the hell is the...  What is Watchtower?  The Jehovah Witnesses come to your house.  That's another sex game he plays, I think, where he dresses her up like a Jehovah Witness.  And they had Adam and Eve and she was naked?  No, you know what?  Let me tell you something, man.  It is important to role play.  Like, me and my wife was role playing two weeks ago because I was watching Silence of the  Lambs and the part when, um, uh, Sergeant, Sergeant A, what's her name?  Starling.  Starling's walked by multiple minutes and he threw the semen in her hair. 
[01:58:00]  I love that.  I told my wife to go put a dress outfit on and walk by the bed.  Well, don't tell that story on Fox in Detroit.  Yeah, let's, uh, let's go to Mike in Babylon.  Try to get control of this.  Uh, Mike, what's up?  Help us out, Mike.  The animal's gonna get you.  Hold on.  What's going on, Opie?  Hey, Mike.  Listen, please, please, please take the keys from Tracy before he gets behind the wheel  of the car.  Oh, my God.  Marcus!  My friend.  You love it. 
[01:58:30]  You know you love it.  All right, uh, listen to this audio if you could, if you could, uh, there, Tracy.  Here we go.  Listen to this story.  A woman slipped and fell in a Florida supermarket with injuries severe enough to require fire  rescue, but store surveillance reveals there might be more to this story than needs to be  eye.  Cameras captured the woman's fall, but when the store owner rewound the tapes, he saw  the same woman in that same aisle just minutes before.  You can see her take a bottle of olive oil, twist off the cap, and pour it on the floor,  and then hides it on the shelf. 
[01:59:00]  She then returns to that spot and falls.  The woman has not been charged with the crime, nor has she tried to file a claim against the  store.  The store owner says, though, he's glad that he spent more than $30,000 on a state-of-the-art  surveillance system.  Now, if that was me, her black brother, it would have gave me 15 years.  It was her sister.  Yeah.  It was?  I really think I was a white lady that would have done that.  All right?  First of all, we don't use oil like you guys do. 
[01:59:30]  It's old school, man.  That's the old banana in the tailpipe trick.  Yeah.  I shot myself.  I got $800 out of it.  Took me to Warhol Hospital in Brooklyn.  I shot myself.  That's old school.  You know that crap, right?  Yeah.  It's old school.  I did that when I was 18.  The video's great.  She's walking.  I wanted to get an outfit.  You see her slip and fall on the floor.  And then a woman comes over to help her.  Yeah.  And grabs her arm and starts lifting her up. 
[02:00:00]  And she slips and falls again.  She's such a ham.  You know that was my mom's, right?  Was it?  She's called my mom's a ham.  How much she gonna get?  She set up her own oopsie.  Yeah.  A little oopsie.  And then they show her the rewound tape.  She wasn't sure of Dirty Rock coming back.  So she said, I need to do this.  Where's the video?  It's up on break probably?  Yeah.  It's somewhere up there.  So she set it up because obviously she's trying to get some cash.  People are getting desperate, man.  Yep.  Yeah.  Cash, man.  People are getting desperate, man.  Gas is high.  We need to. 
[02:00:30]  The war has been over.  We got to fix the price on gas, man.  It cost me $78 filling up that Corolla.  You got a Toyota Corolla, do you?  Yeah, man.  I got like eight people pregnant.  Who paid you $800 to shoot yourself?  I call women people.  I said eight people pregnant.  Wait, Rich, what?  Who paid you $800 to shoot yourself?  How'd you get $800?  My dude Craig, you don't know him.  Leave it alone.  All right.  You working for the district attorney's office? 
[02:01:00]  You working for the DA?  They gave you a can of grape soda and a cigarette to snitch?  Would you want to try to see me get shoot programmed?  Pelican Bay?  Hold on.  Look.  My phone ringing.  Look.  Michael Jackson.  Look.  Wow.  You don't have a phone.  I can hear it.  Are you deaf?  As soon as Michael buys his house in Maryland, I'm coming over there.  I want to go see Blanket. 
[02:01:30]  His son's name is Blanket.  Yeah, I know.  He doesn't really?  He wants to know why people grow up and start gangbanging.  That's what Michael does to the son's memory.  When the little boys came to his house, he said,  Yo, bud, it's mine.  Hey, let's say hi to Sarah in Boston.  Sarah, you want to get pregnant?  Hey, Sarah, what's up?  Sarah, you're on the radio.  Come on.  Hello?  Yeah, let's go.  Hi.  You're on with Tracy Morgan.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey.  I want to know where Tracy Chaperone is. 
[02:02:00]  My what?  Your chaperone.  I don't have one, baby.  Who the hell let you get drunk at nine in the morning and go on the OVNC?  Wow, I'm drunk?  Well, I'm not out.  Baby, I'm not out of control.  You just never heard nobody like me.  I'm just waiting for you.  Huh?  I know where the next call's coming from.  Are you a part of Mad Mothers Against Drunk Driving or something?  Are you like a soccer mom? 
[02:02:30]  No.  You ever had a black friend?  No, I got a place for you, Tracy.  What?  I think they're going to be calling next.  Who?  That rehab that Lindsay Lohan was in, they're waiting for you.  Why do you say that?  You've been laughing all morning.  Because you're hammered at nine in the morning.  She thinks you're having this.  Yeah, I know.  She's crazy, though.  She's been affected.  Where does she live at?  Who?  Sarah?  Yeah.  In Boston.  Oh, okay.  I know what Boston is about.  The next caller. 
[02:03:00]  Let's go to the next caller.  I know what Boston is about.  People, uh...  You guys love black people there.  Let's go to a gym in Detroit.  Jim, what's up?  She was trying to destroy me.  Didn't they burn down Robert B.  Jim.  Treat me like I'm Alec Bowen or something.  Were you a Kim Basinger fan or something?  Jim, what's up?  Too old for that.  Jim.  Jim, you're on the air.  How you doing?  Good.  What's going on?  Don't be discouraged by this Detroit stuff, man.  We're absolutely looking forward to you guys coming in here.  Oh, no.  We can't wait.  We think it's hilarious Stephen Lynch got kicked off the tube there. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, he kind of shocked them right off the bat with a little herpes comment saying  that Dina Sinafonte, their name, the co-host, he had made a comment or she made a comment  like we have something in common.  And he goes, oh, yeah, you got herpes, too.  He didn't tell us that.  Oh, he didn't tell us that.  Oh, it's pretty funny.  He didn't tell us that.  That was right off the bat, too.  So I think that kind of shocked him.  But we're loving you guys.  Keep it up.  All right.  Thank you, Jim.  We'll see you tomorrow night. 
[02:04:00]  God, Stephen Lynch failed to tell us that little tidbit.  They went right into red alert after that.  They were in red alert.  Right after that.  Red alert.  That's the biggie.  All right.  Let's say hi to Kristen in Grand Rapids.  Kristen, what's up?  Hi.  I just wanted to tell everybody about the after party that's going to go on tomorrow night  after the show.  Okay.  It's at the Hills Bar at 6810 North Rochester Road in Rochester Hills, Michigan. 
[02:04:30]  There's drink specials and a band and Jaeger girls.  Is that right by, there's a gas station there on the corner?  I have no idea.  I'm not from Rochester Hills.  I was just going to say that.  The website is thehillsbar.com.  Oh, there you go.  You're just trying to plug a local joint?  Yeah.  Well, that's where everyone's going afterwards.  It's operated by a guy on Wackback.  Oh, okay.  So it's actual listeners from the show are going to this establishment?  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you.  How many people does it hold?  Like 80? 
[02:05:00]  No, I'm sure more than that.  How many people does it hold?  All right.  I've never been there, but it's the past after party.  The guy has flyers going around and everything.  All right.  Very cool.  All right.  Thank you, Chris.  And we'll see you at the show tomorrow.  Let's say hi to Jesse in Brooklyn.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Tracy Morgan, what's going on?  What's up, Brooklyn?  Hey, hey.  Hey, Tracy.  How many women do you think you've slept with?  What?  How many women have you slept with your whole life?  You know, not many. 
[02:05:30]  About 10,000.  About 10,000?  Yeah, about 10,000.  I'm a big pimp.  You're an animal.  That's all you have for them?  This is Jesse in Brooklyn.  I'm punching out.  All right.  Let's go to Brian in Massachusetts.  Brian, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey, I heard in real life that Tracy and Alec Baldwin don't get along.  Oh, boy.  They're coming after you now, Tracy.  Yeah, I know.  Is that true or not?  Hey, Tracy, can I ask you one more question?  What's up?  You must have got your ass whooped as a kid a lot with a girl's name, you and Patrice,  because brothers, you know they'd be calling you Tracy and picking on you when you were younger. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  Slapping the shit out of your ass.  Right.  She's just thug from way back.  Why are you cursing on the radio?  Yeah, why are you cursing?  That's an angry white dude.  White guy.  I know.  He's going to turn into the Incredible Hulk soon.  You got to get laid, bro.  You got to get laid.  All right.  Get rid of some of that frustration.  Time for the plugs.  We got to plug Tracy tonight through Sunday.  Is it Caroline's?  212-757-4100?  Yeah, 4100.  There you go, Jimmy.  Wow, from memory. 
[02:06:30]  Tracy is there.  I'm doing three shows Friday tonight.  Yeah.  Three shows tomorrow and one show on Sunday, right?  Yeah, we're doing one on Sundays for fun.  And we are, tonight I'm doing a book signing at 730 at Borders, 34300 Woodward in Birmingham.  So if you can, come, please.  And tomorrow night, obviously, is the big show, the Traveling Virus show.  Obvious.  And we're at the DTE Pavilion.  Yeah, there you go.  In Detroit.  And Military ID gets you in for free.  It's a great show.  There's a lot of great comics on it.  This is, I think, the most stacked lineup we've had so far. 
[02:07:00]  Yeah, absolutely.  Brought to you by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Rich, you plugging anything?  No, no.  No.  I'll just, no.  Hang on.  Cooling out.  You'll be there tomorrow night.  Yeah.  And Bonnie's staying home with the newborn.  You guys are going to rock in Detroit.  Oh, man, I can't wait to get back on the road with you guys.  You're the best.  Thanks.  Word up.  I'll have fun.  How big of an incision did they make to take the baby out there, Rich?  I haven't looked.  You didn't look?  No, I'm not looking down there yet.  I'll wait till it feels a little.  But she already had a scar down there, so they re-  Oh, yeah? 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  Are you looking forward to having sex again, finally?  Oh, gosh.  What's that about?  I give this two years.  What?  What's that about?  Yeah.  We've already been married almost two years.  Two more years, I'm saying.  Oh, two more?  Yeah.  Well, uh, that's cool.  Yeah.  That's cool.  You know.  You sound psyched.  Like, where are you going, right?  Where are you going?  Listen, I'm really, you know, listen, I'm happy, man.  Things are cool.  I'm just a little burnt out, you know.  It's been a tough week.  What kind of shoes are those? 
[02:08:00]  What kind of shoes are those?  The Reeboks.  What, you got something?  You don't like them?  Just child shoes.  You should be wearing retards.  They matched the shirt I was wearing last night.  That's why I got them on.  Why, was it also stupid looking and childish?  Stop wearing baby shoes.  What's wrong with you, man?  You know, stop wearing shiny new sneakers.  You're not 18.  You're an older gentleman.  I've had these sneakers for a year and a half.  Yeah, I know, because they're a workout sneaker, so you would have them for two more years, 
[02:08:30]  probably.  Oh.  And Rich fights back.  Sure does.  Punches out of the corner.  All right.  Rick Voss, DVD, Amazon.com.  This is a good place to leave it.  Amazon.com?  Did you just say Amazon.com?  Amazon.  Amazon, that's where you should go for Voss's DVD, Amazon.com.  Amazon.com.  Oh, my God.  Amazon.  Oh, my God. 
[02:09:00]  I was on a plane yesterday, and I'm listening to Otto and George's CD.  I haven't heard it on my iPod, and I'm just howling.  It's a plane.  That's stuff I've heard 50 times.  Yeah.  It's just so nasty.  All right.  We'll do this again.  All right, Rich.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  The audio of Bonnie giving birth was the big get today.  Thank you for that.  Tracy, I don't know what we did with you today, but it was fun.  It was fun.  Absolutely.  All right. 
[02:09:30]  Tracy Morgan, everyone.  He'll be at Caroline's tonight.  If you're not joining us over at XM, we'll hopefully see you tomorrow at the show in Detroit.  If you're too far from that area, have a great weekend.  We'll see you guys soon.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  And the show continues on XM Satellite Radio.  Satellite.  How was your nap? 
[02:10:00]  It was good.  Good.  I needed it.  It's like a little cat nap.  Meow.  Fucking photo.  Meow.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I'm trying to take a photo of my pal fan.  Right.  See, all of us with our iPhones, we take pictures of everybody's face, and when the  phone rings, the face shows up.  It's neato.  Oh, that's perfect.  You like that one there, Jim?  He's as big a douche as you're ever going to see anywhere.  Let's see. 
[02:10:30]  Wow.  Dan takes a good photo for the iPhone.  It certainly does.  And that'll ring, and then this picture will pop up, and you'll go, eh, ignore.  I'll ignore it.  So whoever's sitting at the table with me will be like, why aren't you answering the  phone for that smiling douche?  And I'll say you answered your own question.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  My husband listens to Z100 in the morning.  Why, Ope?  Apparently this morning they plugged chocolate rain.  Are you married?  So Opey was right. 
[02:11:00]  It's the next big thing.  Other radio stations discovering chocolate rain.  They're playing chocolate rain like it's new.  That's terrific.  There you go.  We laugh at them.  Of course we do.  We were playing that for six years now.  We've been playing that for a long time.  Right.  All right.  Chocolate rain.  We got a guest of sound.  Another guest of sound from Pat Duffy.  Okay, I think I know what it is already.  All right.  What is it?  I don't know.  I'll have to hear it first.  I have not heard it.  All right.  We'll play this for everybody. 
[02:11:30]  Was Tracy drunk?  We don't think so.  That's just Tracy being Tracy.  That's just the way he is.  All right.  Here's a guest of sound for today.  I know it.  A bridge collapsing.  Too soon.  Is it?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  It's a scream.  It's a yell from a guy.  One more time. 
[02:12:00]  Listen closely.  No.  What happened?  I can barely hear it now.  I can't hear it.  Somebody's shitting in that?  A fucking cinder block.  Somebody taking food away from Bobby Kelly?  A yelling man.  It is a man, right?  One more time.  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  I got it.  Yeah?  Somebody yawning after a rape.  That's not like a yawn.  Let's say hi to Jeff the Trucker.  Jeff, what's going on today, buddy?  Hey, not much, guys.  I love you.  You guys are the best.  Thanks.  What you hauling today?  What you hauling? 
[02:13:00]  I'm hauling milk.  Oh.  Big old tanker full of milk.  So is my wife's pitch.  Hey, don't make fun of your wife's pitch.  No, she's doing the breast thing.  They are big.  Oh, yeah?  They're all full.  Yeah, yeah.  They're nice full bosom.  Milk is flying out or whatever.  It's not milk yet, but.  It's liquidy.  Are you going to feed off them while you have sex?  That's pretty hot.  Oh, God.  I used to have fucking cyber sex with this girl, and this was years ago.  I wanted to knock her up, and she was going to fucking feed me. 
[02:13:30]  Like, I was going to suck her tits and feed, and she jerked me off.  Wait, you wanted to knock her up just for a sexual fantasy?  No, it was hot.  No, it was hot.  No, it was sexy.  And she was going to feed me.  She was going to cradle my head, and I was going to nurse while she put lube in her hand  and jerked me off.  Jerk-off parts, all right, but I don't know about the feeding.  Something so nurturing about being jerked off.  That's what that last nurturing was.  All right, Jeff, what do you got?  Hey, fun saying you. 
[02:14:00]  Thanks for bringing back X-Cube Gold.  I love getting back in the ugly.  I always think of Jimmy running down the streets with just looking for that one hooker with  the braces that the pimp took away from her.  And the other thing is that sound.  That was me the other day when that highway patrol pulled me over for speeding.  I'm punching out.  You can't punch out.  Let's get a rob on Long Island.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, is that sound the sound of Iraq when he eats bad salmon? 
[02:14:30]  That's all I got, guys punching out.  That's pretty good.  He was on the bull for a while.  Remember when he was late because he was shitting?  Iraq, when did the liquid stop pouring out of your asshole?  Late Monday afternoon.  It finally kind of stopped.  Yeah.  Did it get to the point where you were, like, dry heaving from your ass?  Yeah, I noticed throughout the day the color starting to change gradually to the point where  it was, like, a yellow.  All right. 
[02:15:00]  You know what I've noticed?  Right when we go to XM, the conversation goes to shit immediately.  It just turns to shit.  I want to hear the sound again.  I think I figured it out.  A deaf boy singing.  Ah.  It's a deaf boy singing.  Let's say hi to Scott in Arizona.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, I want to play against the sound.  I think that's E-Rock's toothbrush.  What do you mean by that, sir? 
[02:15:30]  Explain.  That's, uh...  And by the way, can the prep sheet...  Does it have to be so colorful?  Oh, I know what that sounds like.  Like a fucking Scarface's office.  That sound is...  The one he was going to fucking kill Franken?  It's sagging yellow.  It's awful.  That's Sean Penn taking Chavez's cock in his mouth right there.  Well, I didn't hear you.  What?  I didn't hear you.  That was a good line.  What'd you say?  We didn't hear it.  All right, so play the sound again.  I don't...  I don't know what's going on with this disc.  Oh, come on. 
[02:16:00]  All right, we'll try to get the...  Oh.  Way to burn a CD, Pat Duffy.  Yeah.  God, Pat Duffy.  I said it's, uh, Sean Penn taking Chavez's cock in town.  I heard you the first time.  Oh.  You...  Of course we did.  No.  You got nothing and deserved it.  Why?  You don't think that's a good line?  Why?  Why?  I don't get it.  Wait, what's the line again?  Well, Anthony understands it because he read the article. 
[02:16:30]  What's the line?  Go.  Sean.  I'm not doing it again, you fucking...  We didn't hear because I was laughing over Jimmy.  You did hear.  Making funny again.  Sean Penn taking Chavez's...  No, it's not a good line.  The cock in the mouth line is not good.  Why?  Okay, I didn't mean to stand up.  The reference is a good line.  Why do you say it?  I don't understand it.  It's like it has nothing to do with each other.  Yes, it does.  He's walking hand in hand.  I know.  I'm the one who read you the article.  You didn't read me.  I did read it to you.  Google eyes.  You didn't read me anything.  What's the line?  Go.  Fuck the line. 
[02:17:00]  That is someone getting kicked in the nuts.  Oh, no, no.  No?  Chuck in Massachusetts.  What's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Good morning, guys.  I'm going to try and guess the sound.  All right.  A man passing a kidney stone.  I had one.  I had it.  Is that it?  Well, we really can't play this game because the CD.  We'll play when it feels like it.  Damn it. 
[02:17:30]  Susan Waldman coming.  You want me to leave now?  What happened?  What?  What's the problem?  Is that the entire audience?  Uh-oh.  There seems to be a problem over here.  Is Bonnie okay?  Oh, let's listen.  Is she okay?  Yeah, it's Bonnie.  Is she all right?  Yeah, yeah.  She's alone?  She's lonely?  No, she's got to leave the hospital today.  Oh.  Can they get her balloons and stuff when they wheelchair her out? 
[02:18:00]  Can she call in?  Yeah.  I mean, I would like to hear what you did wrong.  Wait, you want her to call in now?  Yeah.  You want to call in and tell everybody how it went?  Yes.  Have her call in.  I've got to get her to the number.  Hold on.  Here.  Dan will talk to you and give you the number and stuff to call in.  We'll call in right away.  Call in right away.  Yes, immediately.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Tampa.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, I know what the sound is.  Yeah.  That would be Bonnie opening her eyes at the moment of conception and realizing it's lost 
[02:18:30]  on top of her.  Longer, sir.  Longer, sir.  Longer.  Make it longer.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Let's go to Glendale and talk to Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, I want to play Get the Sound.  Okay.  Ben Wahang and himself.  See, this thing doesn't want to play when it's supposed to, so.  Ben Wahang.  I'm not sure.  Why would we have audio? 
[02:19:00]  That would be silly.  And then it starts by itself.  It's a ghost, Dopey.  There's a ghost.  Yeah.  You know, fuck it.  It's a kid falling off a skateboard.  Next.  Oh.  Nice.  I'm writing a play.  Smashed.  It's about a ghost in a radio station and just plays things that aren't supposed to be played.  Oh, fuck.  You know what the name of the play is?  Huh?  It's called The Ghost in the Radio Station.  Nice.  Yeah.  Starring myself and the ghost.  That's cool.  Yeah.  I play a radio guy who's, the ghost is torturing him. 
[02:19:30]  The ghost.  Just a kid falling off a skateboard.  Ah!  Just a kid falling off a skateboard.  Did he bust something?  What happened?  Come on.  His arm had to twist off or something.  Talking back to me, so.  Why not?  That's because you know how to handle a woman.  Jesus.  I get it.  Is Bonnie calling in?  This is the number.  You know what this is?  The phones don't work in here, dude, because there's a ghost in the radio station.  A ghost.  A ghost makes things not work.  He comes up when you're in the middle of playing a song and he goes,  Ah! 
[02:20:00]  And you're like, oh no, it's that ghost again.  That's good.  It's a ghost.  This is a ghost.  Scary.  Yeah, ghosts are scary.  The ghost just comes and he messes up all the CDs and carts.  Yes, right now.  Sure.  If you ask that question again.  Oh my God.  I'm going to bite your forehead.  Ow.  Oh.  She's calling right now?  Yeah, she's going to call.  Calling Bonnie.  I think I should be at the hospital.  I should be home when she takes the baby home for the first time. 
[02:20:30]  No, why should you be?  Just be here clowning around in a radio station.  Yeah.  Much of dopes.  Spend your whole life neglecting the child.  Start now.  Wow.  So she can turn out like you guys?  What?  Successful?  Exactly.  You're talking to two millionaires.  Don't try to stick up for your childhood.  Shut up.  Britney Spears is a millionaire too.  All right?  Exactly.  So she's doing okay.  She'll be dead soon.  She's nuts.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Open end are very successful guys.  Yeah, right.  My child.  I don't know.  It wasn't very good.  What's wrong with boss A and boss B? 
[02:21:00]  Ugh.  What?  Fucking Eddie.  You don't attack the bosses.  Eddie Haskell.  Shut your fucking mouth.  I don't know who Eddie Haskell is.  To reference if you were watching television in 1950.  I know.  Oh, you're Uncle Melty.  Is she on?  Jesus Christ.  Fucking horrible.  We're just waiting for Bonnie to call in.  Oh, no.  It's the ghost.  What the fuck?  There's a ghost in the station.  Did I tell you about the play I'm writing?  Hello?  Yeah.  It's called the Radio DJ Ghost.  They gave her a number that's busy. 
[02:21:30]  The number's busy?  Yeah, the station's WGST.  How could it be?  Ghost.  It's ghost.  Ew, why are you showing me a picture of Britney's fat ass next to a black guy's fat ass?  Oh, that picture is so fucking wrong.  What the fuck is that?  Look, she's in the middle to try to hide her fat ass.  Nice.  She's got a huge ass, and she looks like she's on something.  You can see it in her eyes.  What is she doing?  Huh?  What is this picture, E-Rod?  That was about a week or so before she shaved her head. 
[02:22:00]  That's a juicy ass.  But she's...  I didn't know she was black.  I don't know.  A basement's on?  Somewhere.  She's got a massive ass in this picture.  Big, big fucking ass.  Her eyes are all...  Oh, sorry.  Where is it?  Oh, wait.  We are, XM.  Okay, sorry.  I was sleeping during the changeover.  Big fucking ass.  And there's a black guy standing next to her, and a white girl standing on the other side.  And they're kind of squished against her to hide some of her white ass.  You notice that?  I think it's nice, dude.  And it's not working.  I like that. 
[02:22:30]  Let's say hi to Bonnie.  Bonnie, what's up?  Hey, I have a white baby.  Bonnie, congratulations, man.  Congratulations.  Yes.  Thank you.  It was actually very moving, the audio.  Like, we were laughing at the grunts and stuff, but then when the baby cried, it was actually  very nice.  Yeah, it hit most of us in this studio.  I don't know what went on.  I can't remember it, Hartley.  You don't remember it going like, uh, uh, uh.  Because it doesn't hurt, but you, like, you know exactly what's going on. 
[02:23:00]  You can get snipping, and you can feel all the pressure and everything.  And you know there was a...  There were, like, grunts of, like, oh, my God, psychologically, I'm getting messed up  right now.  And was Rich, um, how, was Rich good, or was there some improvement that could have been  needed?  Well, before we went in, he would have started, like, harassing the anesthesiologist and the  head nurse, which, these are the two people who have my life in their hands. 
[02:23:30]  You know, I didn't think that was a great idea.  I was calling him third world.  Take the hint.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  But you could feel when the scaffold was cutting across your stomach, right?  With the what, Rich?  The scaffold was cutting across your stomach.  Was there a scaffold cutting across your stomach?  Whatever.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yes.  Wait.  Oh, my God.  There was a sheet hanging out so you couldn't see.  You couldn't see, but you could see.  So he kept looking over the top of it.  Hold on.  So they took the scaffold, though, and where did they cut? 
[02:24:00]  What do you mean?  Well, the father of your daughter just said that a scaffold was used to cut you.  No, he was on a building on the side.  Yeah.  A scaffold.  He wouldn't have it in the room.  A scaffold.  A scaffold.  Oh, my God, Rich.  A scaffold.  How did you make it this far?  I don't know.  How do you not just miss your mouth with food?  Like you ought to put it in and it just falls by your cheeks?  And then he starves to death. 
[02:24:30]  I'm tired.  Whatever.  You know what I'm saying.  The other day, he asked me how to spell the word feel.  Really?  Did you really, Rich?  F-E-A-L?  Was that the deal, Rich?  What?  Well, that's not about me.  Let's talk about the baby.  How appropriate that the word feel you have no connection to.  Can you hug your friends?  Bonnie, we played the audio today.  Have you heard it yet?  I sound like a loser.  Well, you want to hear it? 
[02:25:00]  What?  Hold on.  I think we should play it for you.  You sound like you're in pain.  Yeah, you want to hear it?  Not really.  Just listen to a speck of it.  Can I listen?  Yeah, it's not bad.  It's very...  I'm amazed you allowed us to play this today there, Bonnie.  I didn't know what was going on.  Yeah, she didn't know.  You're a trooper.  Oh, I didn't know he was recording when he was recording, but...  Yeah.  Are you breastfeeding?  Yes.  How weird was it the first time? 
[02:25:30]  How weird was it the first time?  It actually...  She was...  I have really...  I must have really great breast milk.  She was like...  It was so easy.  Everybody says it's going to be really hard.  Well, morons do it.  Well, savages do it.  There are people dropping kids all over that know they just stick it to a tit.  Well, the babysitter, Bonnie...  I know, but you should see how much information there is on breastfeeding and how it's really 
[02:26:00]  hard to do and, you know, there's people that take classes.  Classes?  Yeah.  Americans are silly.  We get crack at it, right, doing it all the time.  Yeah.  We didn't even go to one class for any of that crap.  We.  It's just we shit.  You stood there hassling the doctor that the camera wasn't being held right.  Yeah.  Do you know that, Bonnie?  No.  During the most important moment.  You're meeting your daughter for the first time and you're saying stuff like hello and  there's tears in your eye.  The baby's crying. 
[02:26:30]  You hear Voss in the background giving instructions on how to take the proper picture.  No, doctor.  It goes this way.  Turn the camera this way.  And it went on and on.  He kept talking about the camera.  He's missing, like, the greatest moment of this kid's life.  The most tender moment when the baby is first given to the mother and he's arguing with  the doctor about a camera.  I don't remember that.  Oh, yeah.  Good.  Block it out.  Yeah.  Well, here's, uh...  Bonnie, you gotta hear this.  Oh, God.  Okay.  It's you giving birth.  Here it is. 
[02:27:00]  The big moment.  What's that?  What's that?  Oh.  Lots of pressure.  Oh.  That's pressure, Bonnie.  And we've been trying to figure it out all morning, Bonnie.  What's the grunting all about?  Oh.  Because there's so much pressure.  Pressure?  Yeah, like, because you can't really feel it, but you can still feel the pressure of it.  Like, they're pushing down really hard to get the baby out.  Oh, so you're going, like, oh, oh.  Are you on drugs, Bonnie? 
[02:27:30]  Did they put you on anything?  Oh, no.  She did it straight up.  They cut her stomach open without anything.  Some people do.  I think there was demoral, demoral, and the, um.  Wait.  You call me dumb?  Yes.  They're cutting her stomach and taking the baby out.  Were you on drugs?  Oh, I didn't know it was the cutting of the stomach.  Yeah, I don't think any C-section's done without anesthesia.  Oh, I didn't know it was a C-section.  And a natural childbirth when it comes out of vag.  I didn't know it was a C-section.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You guys can hear her right now.  Oh, yeah.  Can you hear her? 
[02:28:00]  We made all those C-section jokes about Voss's hair and all.  Oh, I didn't know he was just making fun of Voss.  I didn't know.  Yeah, that's where that.  Okay, I didn't know she had a C-section.  Oh, cool.  What does the baby hear, Daddy?  Yeah.  She just found out who her daddy is.  That's what they do.  Do you like it so far?  I can't hear.  I'll let you guys go.  Oh, see, you're using the baby as an excuse.  Bonnie.  We want to play this audio for you.  Bonnie. 
[02:28:30]  Okay, let me try to just quiet her down a little bit.  Well, put her on your brush.  Just do a breastfeed her.  Okay, I'll breastfeed her while I'm talking.  While you're talking, you're a creep.  What's wrong with you?  She knows I'm joking.  She knows I love babies.  And no matter who walks in the room, if they start making noise, just stick them on a tit.  She really is a gorgeous baby, though.  Oh, she's really pretty.  She's probably the prettiest baby in the hospital and that you've ever seen, right?  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  And smart already.  She really is.  She can hold her head up already.  I'll bet you when Rich said, how do I spell feel, the kid said, two E's, stupid.  Don't make me laugh, I am.  Yeah, it hurts to laugh, I'm sure.  Yeah.  How big an incision they make?  It goes pretty much all the way across.  Wow. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  All the way across.  It goes right above my pubic area.  Yes, the pubic area.  Tell us more.  They shaved it, too.  I watched them shave it.  Nice.  They put a little, it's like a little mohawk, right?  They made it into a mohawk for you?  I like to pretend they don't have any hair there to begin with.  Thanks.  Oh, there's a lot.  It's hard to get to it in a later month.  You guys can resume sex maybe, you know, soon. 
[02:30:00]  I know you said it was a little bit dull for a while because it's not as hard when someone's  pregnant.  Well, we did it.  We started doing it again.  Oh, really?  A couple nights ago, yeah.  A couple nights ago.  Wow.  Right before she, yeah.  Did she come out with a black eye?  Oh, no.  No.  That old guy.  Well, because I, I don't know, I was sitting in the kitchen and she walked in and it was  sexy.  I said, you know, let's do it here.  Right.  Wow, way to phrase it.  Fucking hot number you.  Let's do it here. 
[02:30:30]  The brie cheese.  Did you do vaginal or do, you know?  Yeah, but I wanted to do it in the kitchen so she could cook at the same time.  But we, you know, we went upstairs and it was pretty good.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How'd you do it?  You got to use a wacky position.  You can't lay down on top of her belly.  No, no.  I can't.  It was sort of, yeah, over the bed.  Over the bed.  Oh, nice.  You bent her over the bed?  Yeah.  Pregnant woman?  That's why I didn't have to see her stomach.  Right?  I mean, you know, I mean, not see her.  It was beautiful, but, you know. 
[02:31:00]  That's horrible.  Giving your new baby a jizz bath.  What's wrong?  Like that.  Oh, but the surgeon did.  You're giving anyone credit there with the...  Don't laugh too hard.  Remember, it hurts to laugh.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, Rich, maybe you should go home so you can comfort her and calm her  down.  Let's hear some of the audio so I can...  Laugh.  Bonnie, let's hear some of the audio.  All right.  Here we go.  She goes so I can, you know, get off the phone.  Get out of here.  Here we go.  Don't be embarrassed, Bonnie.  It's a beautiful thing that happened. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah.  It's a deep moan.  Oh, daddy.  This sounds like somebody walking up to Norton's window.  What?  What?  Is she out? 
[02:32:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  She's out?  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  Coming out.  Here's the head.  Oh, my goodness.  Look at her little head.  It's queer.  There's lots of pressure, okay?  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at that little baby girl.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Fucking Lifetime movie.  Jesus.  I like crying.  There you have it.  There you have it. 
[02:33:00]  There you have it.  The only part I didn't like about that was Voss saying, oh, my goodness.  Oh, my goodness.  That's how it was like.  You're a fucking mini pearl.  He turned into a real person for a minute.  Oh, my goodness.  That was still very nice.  It is a very nice moment.  It's a very private moment.  What are we doing?  I know.  I feel kind of dirty that we were that today.  No, but this isn't like.  The drug thing.  I'm going to push on you, Bonnie. 
[02:33:30]  She's.  Aw.  What was the one thing you guys cut out?  What was it?  Huh?  Was it spoken?  What?  We cut out?  Yeah.  Nah, it's just something.  It's nothing.  The baby.  Hey.  Bonnie.  Okay, yeah.  I'm going to go.  Do you want to hear more?  I just.  I have a crying baby in my hand.  I don't know if that's good audio for radio or not.  Nah, they just do that.  Just throw her on a tit so we can play more audio for you. 
[02:34:00]  I'll pass it on to the janitor.  Here we go.  Oh, no.  Why, there's more?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Here it is.  Am I done with the grunting?  Please.  Yeah.  Congratulations.  Now you're just whimpering.  Hairy little girl.  Boss's first words were, hairy little girl. 
[02:34:30]  That was his first words after his daughter was born.  No.  Hairy little girl.  You ever hear from dads that go to their daughters like, and I remember when you were  born, the first thing I said to you was, you are the most beautiful little thing I've  ever seen in my life.  Now, Rich can go.  The first words I said were, hairy little girl.  First of all.  You guys hang on.  I'm still here.  I just have to do something.  Just keep talking.  What are you doing?  First of all, that wasn't the first word.  Because if you hear the baby coming out, I go, oh, a baby girl, da, da, da. 
[02:35:00]  I said, look how beautiful, or whatever.  Okay.  And then when they brought her close to us, I said, hairy girl.  Hairy girl.  Okay.  I never heard beautiful.  The first description of your daughter was hairy, hairy little girl.  No.  Well, that's the first description for good radio, but if you rewind the tape.  I'm so glad you were thinking about doing good radio while your wife's giving birth.  You know, I look psychopaths you guys are. 
[02:35:30]  Hey, can you tape it for us and bring it in?  Yeah, no problem.  Yeah, just tape it.  And then we just rail you.  I try to be a team player all the time.  Tape it.  Awesome.  But you shouldn't be thinking at any time during this whole thing that this might make good  radio.  You should just be there for your wife.  I was, yeah.  It was uncalled for when Bonnie was having the baby and you said, back after this.  You're listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  This is the Rich Voss radio show. 
[02:36:00]  What, Bonnie?  Rich, why didn't you remind me like at some point that, you know, to stop grunting if you  were really concerned?  Well, because first of all, we wanted it real.  We have a lot of video of before and after.  They didn't even play where they gave you, remember when they tried to break your water  and the guy put that knitting needle in you, right?  No way.  Yeah.  I had that on the tape in there, too.  The doctor came in to try to break her water, right?  Yeah.  You know, and he had this long needle. 
[02:36:30]  Remember?  Remember that?  Yes, I do remember that.  Do you remember?  And, you know, I have that on.  Yeah, it was yesterday.  Oh, and when the doctor, when the doctor was trying to break her water with a knitting  needle, the doctor's phone started.  With a what?  Wait, wait.  With a what?  Like a knitting needle.  Oh, that is funny.  The doctor's phone went off.  It's funny.  The doctor's phone started ringing when, and the doctor's phone is a baby crying or something.  So, the doctor's got his hand in a big pin in Bonnie's, you know, whatever. 
[02:37:00]  You say it.  Her vagina.  And as he's up there probing, his phone starts ringing, and he's answering the phone, you  know, going like this with a phone.  Why would he answer the phone while he's like, point and call?  Because he has kids, too.  I mean, it's not, you know.  He's got a tea time.  No, wouldn't it be funny, though, if he answered it?  He goes, yeah.  Yankees.  Right.  Yankees.  I'll take Yankees.  Yankees and the Padres.  Did it hurt Bonnie when he was putting the needle in there? 
[02:37:30]  No, I'd already had an epidural, so it didn't really hurt.  What is an epidural?  It's like an epidural.  It comes right to your spine, right?  It comes in your back, and then they...  I think right to the spine.  Yeah, it goes right into your spine.  Supposedly, the needle going into the spine is just brutal.  Did it hurt when I put the needle in the spine?  The anesthesiologist was really good.  It hurt, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, for sure.  Yeah.  Not much nerves in the spine, so you don't have to really worry about it.  You're a needle in your...  Can you imagine? 
[02:38:00]  They all know Bonnie's a comic.  I still can't move my neck to the left, but it's all right.  That's okay.  I go to the right.  They all know that Bonnie's like a comic, so the doctor in the delivery room took a manual,  and he has it upside down, trying to be funny, right?  What did he do?  Oh, God.  Yeah, he took the manual, and he goes, now, where do we...  How do we do this here?  Oh, he's doing hack material.  What a hilarious guy.  Everyone knew Bonnie was a comedian, though, in there?  Yeah, he knew she was a comedian.  How many people did you have to tell you were a comedian?  I didn't...  He didn't come up and come out with a rubber chicken at first and hold it by the neck. 
[02:38:30]  Here's your lovely baby.  I'm just kidding.  Waka waka.  All right, Bonnie, we want to play one more clip before we let you go, okay?  This is the one that kind of disturbed us a bit.  You're really having a nice moment, meeting your daughter for the first time, saying hello.  There's crying.  Well, both of you are crying, the baby and you, and you hear Voss faintly in the background  discussing his camera with the doctor. 
[02:39:00]  Here it is.  What am I doing?  Is it calling me to your wife?  No.  Sorry for your wife.  Oh, hi.  Hi, Karina.  Stop.  Can I open?  That's the power.  Hi, Karina.  Twist it.  You gotta twist it.  Okay, you look through that side. 
[02:39:30]  He's just missing this moment.  He's giving camera...  You gotta twist it, now fucking pan out a little bit.  Your wife is like whimpering.  She's saying hello to the baby for the first time, and you're fucking instructing the doctor.  I hear you saying, push power, turn the camera around.  Here's the thing.  And you hear what's going on?  This is the moment.  Yeah.  Listen to me.  This is the moment.  Look at...  Listen, childless DJs.  But also, can I just give you guys a visual? 
[02:40:00]  Rich is wearing full scrubs at this point.  Oh, God.  Is he really?  Yeah, I got the scrubs on and all that crap and...  And the hat.  The hat.  And gloves that have been cut in half.  Yeah.  Little teeny gloves.  They went to...  The little mittens they put on the babies when they come out so they don't scratch their  face up.  Is that why they do that?  Yeah.  You guys, it hurts.  Yeah, don't laugh.  Was there a lot of confusion in there?  The doctor all of a sudden starts yelling, why is the baby cutting its own cord? 
[02:40:30]  Why is the baby talking with a Frankenstein hairdo?  All right, listen, Bonnie, the second half of this clip, just listen for all the camera  instructions going on in the background.  Turn it around.  Turn it around.  It's the other way.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[02:41:00]  It's so cute.  It's so cute.  That is mission facing.  You're looking for a girl facing her baby.  It's the other way.  Here at the end, the other way.  The other way.  Turn it around.  You're the worst.  Endless.  You get distracted by shiny things while your wife is having a kid.  You've never heard anybody miss a moment like that in your life. 
[02:41:30]  Oh, my God.  He completely missed that first moment of baby and mother together.  If you were the camera...  I was going to bomb.  You're the guy that went to buy the fucking hot dog at the beginning of the Spinks-Tyson  fight.  I was going to go with a Barry Bonds hammerman joke, but fuck.  What'd I miss?  No, I could do more than one thing at once.  Yeah.  Ah, sounds it.  You can't defend that.  I can't defend that?  She's saying hi to your daughter, Reina. 
[02:42:00]  No, Reina.  Reina, sorry.  Reina is crying and hello's going on and you're still discussing your camera.  It's a tricky camera.  I guess.  How about your bluff?  It couldn't be.  You use it.  What's that?  How come?  Nothing.  Oh, brother.  How about you say, fuck the camera, you go over to your wife, have your moment, and  then maybe after a minute or two, then you go back and get the picture taken.  I just, there was so much going on, and then I'm holding the baby here, so she, next to 
[02:42:30]  her.  In your left.  It's her, it's only the top of her body sticking out.  You know, it's almost like, and there's, you know, she's getting stitched up down there.  There's like four other people doing, and I'm looking over, and I see this blood just  flowing into something, just like, and it's, and then I looked over and I just saw just  like towels and towels of blood all over her.  Wow.  So, so I got a million things going on in my head.  Yeah, so then, yeah, yeah, focus on the camera angle.  No, but here, calm down, all right? 
[02:43:00]  All right.  Here's the thing.  Why are you telling her to calm down?  Take down the sepia filter.  No, here's the thing.  Don't tell her to calm down.  She had your kid three days ago.  No, not her.  I was telling you.  Oh, you know what?  I'm yelling at your wife.  She's been yelling at my wife.  Will you relax?  Take a deep breath.  Breathe.  So I had a body, didn't hold the camera right.  She probably had a body holding the camera.  Yeah.  Really?  She was doing the instructions, too.  Yeah, me and the doctor were taking a picture together with the baby.  So I'm holding the baby by Bonnie's head, right? 
[02:43:30]  Because I don't even, and her arms were out.  Just her head and arms.  And I'm holding the baby.  Then the doctor out of nowhere says, oh, he goes to take the camera out of my pocket.  He goes, let me take a picture of you three together.  Right?  Did you inform him that it was picture, not pitcher?  Pitcher.  So that's why.  And then he started screwing up the camera, and I'm obsessive-compulsive, and now I'm getting  crazy about the...  It was very...  It was beautiful.  It was nice.  It was really a... 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  So what did you think there, Bonnie?  First sight of the baby, and your first baby.  What were you thinking there?  Uh, I don't know.  It was so overwhelming.  Like, if you wanted, like, a real answer.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Yeah.  I was just...  I was amazed that I had a baby.  I mean, it really happened.  It was just weird.  Like, oh, my God.  The thing was in my guts a few minutes ago, and here I am holding it.  She's little. 
[02:44:30]  She's, like, six pounds, 11 ounces or something, I think, when she was born.  And still, you look at that thing, and you go, that...  That was in my belly.  Like, it is weird.  Do you feel a connection to it?  Yeah.  Do you like it?  Stupid male questions.  Someone's been breastfeeding.  Well, they don't do.  All right, hold on.  We got Sarge from Wackbag on the line.  We haven't heard from him in a while.  Sarge, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to know if this was the first time Rich had Bonnie and Stitches.  Right on, Sarge. 
[02:45:00]  What do you think, like, when you're having a baby like that, like, what are you thinking  the first time you see it?  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's so overwhelming.  You don't think, hey, I'm stuck in this marriage?  You didn't think that?  It pretty much seals my fate.  You know, I honestly, I was like, oh, God, please let her be healthy.  Please let her be healthy.  And then when I saw her, she was, like, beautiful.  I'm not kidding. 
[02:45:30]  She's a really, really pretty baby.  And I was so just happy that she was healthy.  Here's the question everyone wants to know, though.  What about the hands?  She's got the same size hands as Rich.  Already.  Yeah, of course.  Well, that's good news.  That's a good start.  But you already know that, like, she's going to have all her limbs and stuff, because you  have all that, like, check through, like, x-rays and stuff, right? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  X-rays?  What do they even falter stuff?  Yeah, they just radiate the baby.  I'll just tell you everything.  That's great.  Yes, I can tell you everything.  I mean, the baby could be blind or deaf or something.  They won't know that, right?  What's that, Bonnie?  How do they test for that?  How do they test for that?  They yell in the ear.  They bring a doctor and they go, hey.  And if the baby moves, they know the baby can hear.  Well, used to hear, because then you, like, bust the ears off.  Did you just say, really?  Yeah.  How do they test for blindness?  Huh?  How do you know if a kid can see it that way?  He's just 10 seconds old. 
[02:46:30]  You can move your fingers around.  Will he look?  They can't see you that well.  Yeah, they don't really see well at first.  Yeah.  But you've got to wait until they get a little older.  And then they only see, like, I don't know, 10 inches in front of them.  Yeah, they just, everything's a big nipple to them.  Yeah, they just want to see nipples.  Try to suck on it and eat.  I think you're turning Anthony around, Bonnie.  I think he's warming up to the kid thing now.  No.  I'm very happy for you, but no.  Bonnie, have you been kissing her face a lot?  Yeah.  Give me a little kisses. 
[02:47:00]  I do that.  Rich went.  Sorry for saying I was talking to Bonnie.  Hold on.  Sorry that we make it about someone else for a moment.  Back to Rich.  Yeah, go ahead, Rich.  Of course.  Spotlight's on you.  It's your kid.  You did all the work.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to talk to the mother.  I'm sorry.  Rich.  You're right, Rich.  No, Jack, yes, because you say I have no feelings.  You don't.  We're trying to give Bonnie a little spotlight for once.  Go ahead.  Keep going.  We love Bonnie.  We want to make sure that she's happy.  All right.  So she's having the baby.  What was the aperture setting on your camera?  At the time. 
[02:47:30]  At one point, I looked over at Rich, and I thought he was the nurse because he was wearing  the scrubs.  But I couldn't stop laughing.  How long after the birth of your daughter did you realize Rich is going to be a horrible  father?  When did you realize that Rich wasn't the nurse?  When he tried to...  I knew before we went in.  That's not true. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Well...  Scaffold.  All right, guys.  I got open with a scaffold.  Hey, here's the big question.  As we move forward, I don't think this is the first one.  I think you're going to go for another one.  Who's that?  You and Bonnie.  Another baby?  Yes.  I would love it.  See?  And Rich is...  Wait, you're already saying you want another one, Bonnie?  Yeah, it's weird.  It's like...  Because it's...  I don't know.  I've heard this from new mothers.  They're like, yeah, I want to have another one.  You want them to keep cutting you? 
[02:48:30]  This is great.  Your stomach's going to look like a road map.  Well, all the pain and everything is just completely...  As soon as they hand her to you, it's like, oh, this is amazing.  Wow.  This baby's old hat already.  I'm ready to move on for a second.  Yeah.  Get a new one.  Get a new one.  Oh.  Oh, Rich is panicking.  He's like, oh, fuck.  I thought this would be it.  You're going to have another one in about two years.  Okay.  Here's the thing.  Maybe 18 months.  You guys might do the Irish twin thing.  That's good.  Maybe with the next baby, you could ask the doctor about an iPod. 
[02:49:00]  How do you load the songs in?  Hey, guys, I got to go.  It's like...  Oh, new mommy.  New mommy.  I'm going to leave here.  I'm going to come pick you up.  I mean, I can't take you home with the baby in the Porsche, but your mom will come with  the other car, right?  All right.  What?  You had to let everyone know you have a Porsche.  Was that what that was about?  Oh, no.  I just...  No, because I wanted to know what car I have.  What year, by the way?  Wouldn't everybody buy a convertible Porsche right before they have a baby? 
[02:49:30]  Oh, God.  Bonnie's killing.  I know.  Three days after having a kid, it's sliced open.  You knew you had to pick Bonnie up, right?  No, I didn't know what time.  We thought it was tonight she was leaving.  She just called.  That's why she called it.  She's leaving the hospital at 12 o'clock.  The baby seat in a Porsche.  Nice.  She was actually kicking me out because somebody heard the radio this morning.  No, I plugged the hospital.  Somerset, too.  I said how good they were there.  Yeah, they needed it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You plug a hospital.  Yeah.  Gunshot victims. 
[02:50:00]  Remember that he heard it here.  Yeah.  Wow.  You know something?  That hospital's close, but screw that.  Rich Voss told me to go to this one.  No, but the nurses, they've all been kind and nice to you.  You're supposed to do punch the mother in the face?  Well, except the people that bring the breakfast or her food, they screwed up every menu she's  ordered, everything she's ordered, and they're so, you know, they're not, you know, they're  like toll booth collectors.  They just don't care.  You know what I mean?  What's she going to do?  She's laying there all sticks out.  Those are the nurses or doctors.  No, I said they're not the nurses or the doctors. 
[02:50:30]  The food people have screwed up all your food, right?  They gave me the right breakfast this morning, Rich.  When you weren't allowed to eat, did you look over and I was having a sandwich?  Oh, yeah.  You kept eating.  You kept eating.  All right, Bonnie, go feed your kid.  I'll see you in a few.  Congratulations, Bonnie.  Okay, thank you, guys.  Absolutely.  Bye, Bonnie.  And, yes, I did say, is this the first one?  Yes, I meant to say this isn't the only one for you two.  All right, Chris in Michigan, what's up? 
[02:51:00]  Hey, Opie, when you guys had those $10 tickets on sale, I talked to you and you said that you  hooked me up with some free tickets and hooked me up with some free tickets and I never got  them in the shows tomorrow and I just wondered what's going on.  You're a liar.  No, I'm not a liar.  I'm not lying.  I'm not lying, dude.  No, I didn't say you're a liar.  I said this guy's a liar.  No, I remember, Chris.  I don't.  You're kind of dumb, I think.  Chris, did someone talk to you? 
[02:51:30]  What, after talking to me when?  When I said I would give you some $10 tickets and then we put you on hold, did you talk  to someone?  Yes, I did.  What did they say?  I don't know.  They took my name and my address and my phone number and my email address.  I do believe you're going to be on a guest list.  Oh, see, nobody said anything about a guest list.  Boy, you didn't get your tickets yet, though, right?  That's right, Jimmy. 
[02:52:00]  You're supposed to get it in the mail.  I thought I was supposed to.  How else are you going to get in?  Right, right, right, right, right, right.  I believe you're on a guest list, but I'll check.  Where's Kenny?  Is he around today?  Did he do some errands or something before we get out of here?  I had to go.  Chris, hold on.  We'll make sure you get in.  My mother, wife, and I are really looking forward to seeing you.  All right, all right, all right, Chris.  Maybe next time.  Hold on the line.  We'll see where your tickets are, but I think you're going to be on a list, okay?  All right, thank you, Opie.  Take care, Chris.  All right.  Let's do some Stephen Lynch baby in honor of Rich Voss and Bonnie as we go to break here. 
[02:52:30]  Stephen Lynch, one of the many performers tomorrow night in DT, at the DT.  DT Pavilion, yes.  All right, here it is.  This is another child-themed song.  Ooh.  It's because my wife and I just had a kid.  And I don't know who has witnessed the miracle of childbirth, but here's my song about it.  My lady gives birth today.  I run to her room right away. 
[02:53:00]  She smiles with glee.  Whoops.  Then hands her to me.  I'm going to start over again.  Come on.  Maybe you should have detuned.  Yeah, see?  See?  Nah, see?  Nah, see?  I'm transposing in my head.  All right.  My lady gives birth today.  I run to her room right away.  She smiles with glee.  Then hands her to me.  I look at my newborn and say, 
[02:53:30]  Damn, that's an ugly baby.  Damn, that's an ugly ass baby.  I'm feeling quite concerned.  My semen must have turned.  Cause damn, that's an ugly baby.  I can't believe this came from me.  Think her mom did too much LSD.  She's skinny like a twig. 
[02:54:00]  At least her nuts are big.  But the afterbirth's cuter than she is.  Damn, that's an ugly baby.  God damn, that's an ugly ass baby.  I can't take her home today.  She'll scare the dog away.  Cause damn, that's an uglier baby.  And when she smiles I find 
[02:54:30]  Shane McGowan comes to mind  It makes me want to cry  When I look into her good eye  I've always wanted kids  Is it wrong to hope for SIDS?  Then the doctor calls me in  Mr. Lynch, she has a twin  Damn, that's a good looking baby 
[02:55:00]  One for two on the good looking babies  I almost start to weep  Now this one we can keep  Cause that was an ugly ass  Damn, that's an ugly baby  Come on everybody, sing along  Damn, that's an ugly baby  Damn, that's an ugly baby  She's got one good tooth  And one ear and one eye 
[02:55:30]  And thank God just one nose  But it's on her left thigh  Now doctor, I'm asking you  Guide to guide  Would a really, really, really  Late term abortion still fly?  Oh no, not me  I don't want snow ugly baby  I said, damn, that's an ugly baby  Damn, that's an ugly ass baby  Steven Lynch!

[03:01:00]  For The Little Shelter  So how does she know  Like what they need  Like that they needed  Viagra  She probably reads the website  And money for the cattery  She probably reads the website  We were suspicious  When they did a piece  On The Little Shelter  And they showed  Four old bags  And not one of them  Was Marge  And that's when we realized  What's going on with Marge  Does she even work  At The Little Shelter  Oh boy  So then my brother  Has this blind kitten  In his truck  And you know  He's trying to do  The right thing  And drop it off  At The Little Shelter  He goes to the cat section 
[03:01:30]  The cattery  The cattery  And he starts talking  To a woman  And the woman's like  I can't take your cat  I don't want your cat  We don't have room  For your cat  Can't take your cat  Oh really  And then my brother's like  But please come to my truck  And at least check out the cat  It's blind  We found it behind a dumpster  Or behind a store  Or whatever  And she goes  No I can't even  Go to your truck  To check out the cat  Really?  So now my brother  Is stuck  Because he's an animal lover 
[03:02:00]  With a blind kitten  Because The Little Shelter  Will not take the cat in  Why?  That's terrible  There was no explanation  Can't do it  Don't have room  You gotta make  Can't even  Can't even look at the cat  Nothing  You gotta say  Look if you don't take the cat  I'm going right out  The front door  And I'm smashing its head  With my heel  Right  And leaving it on your stoop  How do you know  The cat was blind?  Did it have little sunglasses?  Little cane  Little Ray Charles sunglasses  And it's so hard  Because my brother 
[03:02:30]  He's a lot different than me  He's got this caring heart thing  And he actually went to a vet  And got it all checked out  And the vet said  It's blind  Does the cat-seeing eye dog  Attack it?  See that little cute cat  So my brother's pissed off  Because of the show  He's very aware  Of The Little Shelter  And he's getting married soon  And instead of like  You know  Wedding favors or whatever  He was going to  Donate money to The Little Shelter  He was going to do the right thing  And it was going to be  You know  A nice check 
[03:03:00]  A couple thousand probably  I don't know  See now  And now he's like  Fuck The Little Shelter  And fuck Marge  Because she doesn't even work there  She sort of does PR  And they wouldn't take  My blind kitten  That I found  Wow  See  They lost out on some money  So I can't wait  For Marge to call next  They didn't know  Who they were fucking with  We got the inside scoop  Supposedly she doesn't work there  Disgusting  Alright let's say hi  To Mike  The truck  The trucker driver  It says  They let her hang out there 
[03:03:30]  Because she probably  Fucks herself with the  Dead atrophied eels  When an eel dies  They give it to Marge  And hardens  They got eels at the little shelter  Yes they do  They're very popular  Pets for children  Big fish tank  Just dedicated to the eels  You throw it in the tub  With the little rascal  You watch it strangle him  Eels that people don't want  Throw it on one tank  In the back  I like a cuddly  Furry eel  Please  One that will fetch  And Richard Grabber  From the Bronx  Is calling my brother  A pussy  Because you know  Because he 
[03:04:00]  He takes  He does the right thing  And takes care of an animal  What can I tell you Richard  You're right  You know everything  Mike what's up  Hey what's up yo  Hey  Hey man  Yeah  You guys can hear me right  Yeah what's up Mike  Yeah I just  I've been listening to y'all  For like about a month y'all  And it's just like  You guys are fucking awesome  I love y'all  You guys  You guys wake me up  In the morning  Hey  How about that
