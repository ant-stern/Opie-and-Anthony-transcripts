<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show returned from vacation with a bang, beginning with behind-the-scenes gossip.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, were amused by a rumor that Gary, their "Radio Wizard," was transferring to the finance department, criticizing E-Rock for his tardiness in sharing the news. They jokingly attributed a mysteriously reappearing unused keyboard in the studio to management's psychological games. The conversation then veered towards the VMAs, focusing on Miley Cyrus's controversial performance. While acknowledging some "hot" aspects, they heavily criticized her physique, referencing Mika Brzezinski's call for an MTV employee's firing.  They played a clip of Brzezinski's segment, further mocking her and other commentators they deemed overly prudish.  They also discussed NSYNC's underwhelming reunion performance and Joey Fatone's surprising career shift to Family Feud announcer.  Other topics included criticisms of local news' outdated format, the resolution of the Time Warner/CBS dispute,  Tommy Morrison's death from AIDS at 44, speculations on Justin Bieber and One Direction's futures, and a recap of their ejection from a Howard Stern press conference.  The entire segment was liberally laced with crude language and sexual humor.

The show continued with a critique of a new Eminem song, comparing it unfavorably to the Beastie Boys and Billy Squier.  They segued back to the VMAs, sharing an exaggerated anecdote about Rob Bartlett's role during a Katy Perry performance.  A comparison of Katy Perry and Lady Gaga's music followed, with a grudgingly positive assessment of Perry's "Roar." The discussion moved to Macklemore's "Same Love," debating Ray Dalton's contribution, and subsequently to their opinions of Macklemore and Jay-Z.  Anthony unveiled a new mustache and soul patch, sparking a discussion on personal style.  New interns were introduced, with only one female intern this time.  The hosts then critiqued Alicia Keys' appearance on Good Morning America and offered commentary on a long-distance swimmer from Cuba to Florida, focusing heavily on her appearance and perceived excessive support.  They returned to their Eminem critique, highlighting its lyrical content, including references to Khloe Kardashian.  A listener call about a Bill de Blasio campaign ad led to a discussion of the NYC mayoral race, focusing on candidates' commercials,  Anthony Weiner's campaign, and the Syrian conflict, including Ann Coulter's perspective and criticism of President Obama. They concluded this segment by discussing Jim Norton's vacation and a new addition to Anthony's household.

Ann Coulter joined the show as a guest, and the conversation began with a scathing critique of US foreign policy, referring to the Middle East as a "shithole."  The discussion then turned to race relations in America, focusing on the Trayvon Martin/George Zimmerman case and Coulter's book "Mugged," and alleging media bias in its coverage of black-on-white versus black-on-black crime.  The perceived impact of the O.J. Simpson trial and the roles of Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson were also discussed. They transitioned to NYC politics, praising Mayor Bloomberg's policing strategies, including "stop and frisk," and contrasting them with previous administrations.  Finally, Jim Norton recounted a detailed account of meeting and spending time with Ozzy Osbourne, including a ride to and from a Black Sabbath concert.  This segment was also marked by frequent offensive language and controversial opinions.

The show continued with a discussion about the cancellation of "P-F-G TV," speculating on the reasons based on the host's Facebook posts.  They then transitioned to a discussion of radio personality "Scorch," comparing radio personalities to food.  A large portion focused on promoting their podcast, highlighting recent episodes with guests like Joe Rogan, Papa Rock, Mondo Topless, Roland, and Quentin Tarantino. They discussed their podcast's popularity and their failure to promote recent episodes due to vacation, planning the next day's podcast to focus on Bill Burr's best moments.  A significant part of this segment detailed Anthony's new kitten, "Beavis," including a video of Beavis stealing his sunglasses, and plans to maximize its online reach.  They discussed the kitten's acquisition, personality, and automatic litter box, along with speculation about a potential personnel change at SiriusXM concerning Gary's possible move to finance, eventually culminating in Gary's appearance to deny the rumors. The segment concluded with further discussion of the kitten.

The final segment started with a discussion about a National Geographic show featuring an obsessive toy collector, a married truck driver prioritizing toys over household expenses.  They then shared anecdotes about their parents' struggles with modern technology. A caller, Damien, shared a humorous story about his girlfriend's reaction to wrestlers' physiques, leading to a discussion about fitness and Damien's boot camp experience.  This was followed by a Mama Mancini's meatballs commercial and more listener calls. One caller criticized their toy collecting habits, prompting a debate on adult toy collecting, including an interaction with intern Nikki.  Another caller, Adam, commented on James Franco's age for a celebrity roast.  The segment concluded with further discussions about collecting versus relationships, more listener calls, and interactions with interns, ending with preparations for the next show, all intertwined with numerous jokes and humorous tangents.

[00:03:30]  A lot of money, and I fuck attractive girls. 
[00:04:00]  And a little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R-opening.  It sounds like a little...  What?  Hey, dang, over there.  They don't listen to dang over there.  Stop with that shit.  And now, here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, damn it.  Good morning, everyone.  All right. 
[00:04:30]  Is it the Opie and Anthony show?  Does that sound normal?  September 3rd, 2013.  No, it doesn't sound normal, but what the hell?  Whatever.  Why would it sound normal?  Why would it ever sound normal?  I don't know.  I guess things are going on in here when we were away.  You know what?  I know we've been kind of slacking over the last couple of years, but...  Yeah.  Now everyone is finding out about things that concern me and you and Jim Norton before they tell us.  Yeah. 
[00:05:00]  Ah, well, we are back.  I guess we have a meeting today with Scott Greenstein.  Meeting.  And when they told me we had a meet with Scott Greenstein, I yelled at this person saying,  what for?  And they said, no, no, it's good.  It's good.  What for?  A what for?  And then, I don't know, there's a buzz around this joint that Gary's gone.  Whoa.  That the radio wizard's moving to finance. 
[00:05:30]  Finance.  Damn, that is a bitch, man.  I bet Gary started that rumor.  But when I heard this rumor this morning, even though the guys have been talking about it for a week,  I blasted E-Rock, because E-Rock gives me little tidbits of radio info all the time,  but this big rumor that's going around, he doesn't fucking text me that one.  Oh, were you slamming him good?  No, no, no.  E-Rock, why not?  Why should I?  Because every time I tell him something, why do I need to know this, or who did you hear that from? 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, because I don't care about cowhead.  He's got all the cowhead news.  Right, and you hear about man cow, cowhead, bubba.  I don't care about those people, but when it concerns us, yeah, maybe I do want to hear that stuff.  Well, considering where I heard the original rumor, it wasn't a credible source at the time.  Where did you hear Ralph Cramden's going to be traffic manager? 
[00:06:30]  Ralph Cramden told me.  What?  If Roland can start the Metallica rumor, he can certainly fucking start a rumor that they might be reorganizing behind the scenes a little bit.  Yeah.  He specifically said this time, he specifically said he's not telling you guys.  Oh, no.  Because last, because you fucked him over on Metallica.  Is that why we didn't hear this from Roland?  Is that what's going on?  That's what he said.  That's what he said.  But gossipy Gertie told other people. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, I guess they've been talking about it for a week.  Yeah.  I found out 40 minutes ago.  I found out Sunday.  You found out Sunday?  Yeah.  Travis knew.  So he told me Sunday at my house.  Travis knew.  Travis knew.  Travis knew.  If me and you were friends, then you would have texted me.  Fuck.  Brother Joe's in the pool smiling.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I got the info.  You know, the info I got was so shady and limited. 
[00:07:30]  It's just.  But this was E-Rock's big opportunity to finally give me a little taste of something real.  Some real news.  Some real news.  Instead of, hey, you hear Cowhead might be in trouble.  Who cares?  I know Cowhead's a good guy and I like him, but I don't give a fuck about him.  Yeah.  He had a choice whether to text you or play a little more classic Nintendo game.  Right.  So what's the rumor?  Radio Wizard goes to finance, which as soon as we all heard that, we're like, oh, that's perfect. 
[00:08:00]  That's a perfect place for that guy.  It really is.  No hard feelings.  I'm sure.  Topsy-turvy world of finance.  I'm sure he'll do great with those people.  Yeah, that's, you know, what goes on in finance?  They're probably like, oh, no, that wild Gary's coming over here.  We don't want that wild Gary over here.  He's a nut, that one.  He's going to rise right to the top with those people.  He's going to be a real hoot up there. 
[00:08:30]  What are you hearing, E-Rock?  I go to you.  Scuttlebutt.  Yeah, what?  Make believe you're texting me.  What would you have texted me?  So far, everything you have said is exactly what we've heard.  Right.  And that you were supposed to be told, I guess, today after the show.  Oh, really?  Great.  A nice first day back from vacation meeting after the show.  That's wonderful.  Right.  Great.  Because the keyboard is back, so I don't want to meet with these people.  Why is the keyboard back? 
[00:09:00]  The keyboard's back.  Why is the keyboard back?  You guys have gone for a week, and the only thing different about the studio is the keyboard  precariously placed in the middle of the console for no reason.  Well, that's back.  Usually when you go away for a week, in our case, we went away for a little longer than  a week because we snuck out on that Friday and left everyone with David Lee Roth.  We did.  I forgot about that.  I heard it was good.  Oh, boy.  People either loved it or hated it because David Lee Roth is a bit yappy, a bit yappy. 
[00:09:30]  So we've been gone a while, and that's usually when you could swoop in and make some changes  to make the guys feel like, oh, fuck, the company cares.  Yeah.  A lot of times the construction can't be done because the show's going on.  Sure.  So they wait for the time off.  And when you've got an extended period of time like that, some stuff can get done.  Well, in this case, the keyboard returned.  That's right.  This weird keyboard that just has been sitting there.  I would say this thing has been sitting there for four years, and I don't think anyone knows 
[00:10:00]  what it does.  Yeah.  I don't know what it controls.  It looks like it might control like the lead and profit, but we don't do that from here.  So why would it be here?  Keyboard.  Yeah.  So.  And Sam was the one who said, you actually think they're going to make changes in the  studio because I got excited that day.  Oh, boy.  Did you write that day down?  No, but I remember saying it.  We could find it because I said it on the after show because my after show is postponed  for this meeting that I knew nothing was going to come up. 
[00:10:30]  A whole bunch of engineers kind of nodding their heads and pointing and looking.  And I got excited like, holy fuck, I think they're going to finally do something.  Asking us questions.  So you need this?  Right.  So this would be good like this for you, right?  Yeah, yeah.  And then Sam goes, you're not going to fucking believe what they're telling you, are you?  I'm like, damn it, I was.  Because three months later, the keyboard has mysteriously reappeared.  That's the only change.  You didn't think it was going to happen? 
[00:11:00]  No, I did not.  I really thought it was going to happen, too.  Dude, I'm a fucking outman.  I'm gullible.  I am, too.  I always believe it.  In the end, I'm very gullible.  You want to believe it.  I don't want to admit that, but I am gullible.  We're sweet boys.  We are.  We believe in goodness.  But the keyboard at one point had disappeared.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And now it's back.  Yeah.  And nobody can explain why it was there to start with.  And now why is it back?  Like, who's fucking with us?  I think it's some kind of psyops they're doing to us, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like keeps us down a little bit. 
[00:11:30]  Like, just kind of fucking with us.  I'll bet you that today at the meeting, Scott's going to go, we have this new guy, Gary.  He's going to be running the channel.  He's going to walk in and introduce himself.  Yeah, so he's like, what the fuck?  Finance, huh?  I don't know.  What's there to do in finance?  Oh, I'm sure the books are all right.  That's good.  How many units at this price?  They keep you guys like when a terrorist captures you and goes, you're going home next week.  Yes.  And the next week comes.  They go, you're going home in two weeks. 
[00:12:00]  You go home today.  What?  I'm all dressed up in my go-home clothes.  I feel like bladder tapped out a while ago.  Is he part of the changes?  You seem pretty happy and content during the week you weren't here.  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, we all did.  We're just still full of blinders.  Wow.  All this fucking talking going on while we weren't here.  Well, there was lots of times for gossip and hubbub while you guys were not.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  A lot of scuttlebutt. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  So, who runs the joint?  Who run Bottertown?  You guys' names are on the wall.  Who's Master Blaster here?  Well, when Roland finds out, could he fucking let me know?  Thank you.  He doesn't like his name being brought up with matters like this.  Oh, confidential things.  He freaks out.  Especially you guys shook him bad for the Metallica thing.  That did get him.  Maybe we should text him again.  Oh, boy.  They blew up your spot.  They said it was you.  It wasn't me. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  I wish he could get Scott in on one of these pranks where he could actually call Roland  in.  Like, if he would do it as the goof and go, I don't know why the fuck you're doing this  stuff.  He would start crying.  He would.  It would be sad.  It wouldn't be funny anymore.  I know.  It would just get sad.  I would laugh pretty hard.  Do you think he'd be like that scene in the office when he's accusing her of stealing  and she just breaks down and cries?  We got to get Roland. 
[00:13:30]  We got to get him really good.  Yeah.  So, all right.  That just happened.  So, I figured we should talk about it for a few minutes.  Yeah.  That did happen.  I wish Gary the best.  I do.  And they're in finance?  You haven't had the meeting yet.  What?  There's no meeting.  You can't wish him the best before you're officially.  I've been around long enough to know if, you know, the talk is that much behind the scenes  it's happening.  Yeah, this is a definite. 
[00:14:00]  Radio Wizard to finance.  Radio Wizard.  For a player to be named later.  In other news, I'll be selling serious stock.  Dumping it.  Right.  Alarming, right?  Maybe we can get Tebow to run the channel.  That'd be cool.  Yeah.  He's not doing much.  Oh, poor Tebow.  What a last fucking year's story.  Tebow.  Yeah.  So sad, man.  He really wants to be an NFL quarterback. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Well, who doesn't?  Yeah, but he was a great college player.  It's sad.  Does he just stink?  Or what's his thing?  He just can't throw.  In the end, he just can't fucking throw the ball right.  You need to be able to do that to be a quarterback, right?  I guess.  I don't know much, but yeah.  My Jets are a fucking disaster, so.  I can't believe another fucking football season is here.  Most people are excited.  I'm not.  I didn't even know. 
[00:15:00]  Really?  This weekend?  I don't acknowledge a lot like football.  We're five days out from football.  No, don't they start Thursday, right?  Yeah, Thursday.  So they start in a couple days.  It is here.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  And the paper's saying Rex Ryan doesn't care,  and he knows he's going to be fucking getting fired or leave him  because he went to his son's football game instead of hanging around for final cuts.  Oh.  I guess that was a big deal, according to the sports blogs and the sports people.  Maybe he just feels he's, you know, it's important to be at your kids' events. 
[00:15:30]  Thank you.  That's right.  That's fucked up right there.  There you go.  I thought it was important to be at the beach digging a hole  instead of finding out what's going on around here.  I can understand what Rex is doing.  Exactly.  It's amazing, though, that CBS and Time Warner could come to an agreement  just as football season was beginning.  Oh, they did?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  CBS is back on Time Warner now.  Yeah, there was way too much money at stake for everybody.  They said CBS didn't even notice a big dent in its national ratings. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah.  Like, with New York and those markets, they have so many stations,  they could have waited it out for a long time.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know they got, oh, I guess I did have CBS last night, didn't I?  Yeah, last night you would have.  Huh.  Time Warner's a fucking piece of shit.  They're terrible, dude.  I'm so happy that CBS fucked.  CBS in front of everybody took their cock out and slapped a T and a W on their face.  Good.  Tee-hee.  Yeah, that's, uh...  I can't take when they get into those little bickering things 
[00:16:30]  and they cut off the channels to the people that are trying to fucking just watch TV,  they're paying their dumb bills.  Right.  You couldn't negotiate as if football was on three weeks ago?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And just put the TV back on?  Right.  And people know nationally, right?  Because it only affected New York, what, Dallas?  And L.A.  Yeah.  And L.A., okay.  Well, that's three huge markets.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, but basically CBS was off the cable system for, I don't know, at least a month.  Yeah.  At least a month, right?  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  And they were ready.  They could have waited it out for a long...  I think they knew that football being gone, people would be fucking going to Time Warner  with fucking pipe bombs.  Right.  Yeah.  I watched a lot of local news over the break.  It is horrendous.  That's weird, because I watched a little bit, too.  I know we goof on it on a regular basis, but I really...  I don't know what it was, but I was watching a lot of local news.  It's dated.  I can't believe...  Thank you.  I was like, they haven't changed since I was a kid.  No.  With this fake talk that no one talks like that. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And then the weather girl that goes on forever when all you need is the five-day forecast.  We all could figure that shit out for ourselves.  You have your fucking weather in your phone.  There's not one person right now that matters in this fucking world that can't pop the weather  up this second right now on their phone.  But why can't they reinvent themselves?  It is the exact same newscast, where the anchors don't talk like human beings. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah.  It's really strange.  I don't know.  I think it's an archaic, dated medium.  The whole thing.  The local newscast.  I don't think it applies anymore.  I don't even think they can update it.  It's unbelievable.  It must still be doing well, because they continue.  But this weather broad was talking about the dew point for two minutes.  What the fuck?  For two minutes.  I'm like, holy fuck.  What does that mean?  Yeah, yeah.  Basically means it could rain at any second.  Chad. 
[00:18:30]  But if it does rain, it'll be a quick moving storm.  Okay.  I could get that on my phone.  All right.  All right.  Who's listening to this and planning their day around the dew point?  You weren't interested in the dew point?  No.  The dew point.  No.  But I hung in there, because I couldn't believe how bad it was.  Yeah.  And this is New York local news.  They're supposed to be on the top of the heap.  New York and L.A., their local news is supposed to be a little, actually much better than other  markets.  And it was horrendous. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  The sets look the same.  All the weird teases.  And I'm like, why are you teasing this?  That video was viral two days ago.  Yeah.  It really is just done.  Like, you can't tease anything anymore.  It's on everyone's fucking phone.  Yeah.  Everybody has seen that.  The news comes on, and they play a video you saw two days ago.  And they're like, whoa, look at this.  We'll show you what happens.  Or sports highlights.  You know, they hint that the team could have won or could have lost at the same. 
[00:19:30]  And you're like, but if you're a fan of that team, you already know.  Yeah.  So who's waiting going, oh, my God, did my team win?  I'll tell you, I think old people.  Is it old people they're going for still?  I think it's just old people are left with the local news and fucking the telephone at  home wired into the wall and all that shit that's still a holdover until they all die  off.  But it's the exact same newscast.  And I was watching Good Morning America with George Stepanophilus. 
[00:20:00]  Stepanophilus.  Or whatever the fuck.  George Snuffleupagus.  I hate that guy.  Yeah.  He's like one of those perfect nerd types that you hated growing up.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Part of the young Clinton team during the election.  Yeah, but now he's a big fucking morning show host and he's just a dud.  He's talking about the VMAs and Miley Cyrus.  I'm like, what?  I know I'm old, but fuck, you shouldn't be talking about it at all.  Did that story, was that a big story? 
[00:20:30]  Miley Cyrus?  Whatever.  It was hot as shit.  Who are you kidding?  That ass looked a little weird, though, but it's still terrible.  The ass was horrendous and we've all made our jokes.  It's a shitty ass, but the performance was fucking hot as all hell.  She is sexy, man.  I didn't like the tongue thing.  It just looked kind of silly.  How did she do the tongue?  I didn't see it before.  She just kept sticking out the side of her mouth.  Yeah, that's a thing she's got going on.  I don't know.  Maybe because she's on the mollies.  Yeah.  On the mollies. 
[00:21:00]  She's popping mollies.  What are mollies?  My ecstasy.  Oh, no.  Basically.  And we lost two.  We lost two to the mollies over the weekend.  Yeah, it's some fucking.  Some big fucking show.  Yeah, some show.  Oh, yeah.  What zoo was it?  The E-Zoo?  The fucking Electric Zoo?  Yeah.  What the fuck was the name of the concert?  Yeah, I think Electric Zoo.  Electric Zoo.  They lost two to the mollies and they had to cancel the third day.  So I kind of enjoyed the VMAs this year.  Did you?  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  For the most part, who gives a fuck?  I got to say one thing.  Huh?  That Justin Timberlake is quite the showman.  Yeah.  He fucking, how long was that?  Like 20 fucking minutes?  Mm-hmm.  And he allowed NSYNC, what, two minutes?  Two minutes!  To get up there, pop out of the floor, and then you can tell those guys were beyond excited  to be in the spotlight for two minutes before they went back to their fucking jobs at the warehouse.  Wait, who was the one that couldn't go?  They all went to Justin Timberlake's show and they thought that was what started the rumors, 
[00:22:00]  but there was one guy that couldn't because he had to work?  Yeah, of course he had to work.  I don't remember the guy's name, but there was one of the guys that couldn't come from  California.  It was fucking humiliating.  Oh.  And they're all like a bit fatter except for Justin Timberlake.  Justin Timberlake still looks like a pop star, you know?  Because he is.  He's like, he's huge.  Right, and the rest of the guy's like, ah.  Some of them are just kind of like, yeah, I remember.  Are any of those guys popular anymore?  No.  No.  Who was in NSYNC?  Look at the guys.  The fat one was in a movie, and then they thought, wow, he could maybe be in other 
[00:22:30]  movies, but he hasn't really been in other movies since.  He was in that Greek wedding movie.  Yes, he was.  Joey Fatone?  No, fat one.  Fat one.  Joey Fatone.  Joey Fatone.  That hat, by the way, looks awful on Justin Timberlake.  He looks like he's fucking 58 in that hat.  That hipster fucker.  That fucking fedora should come with fucking, they should come with like C4 taped in them,  and as soon as you put it over your head, your fucking head blows off.  What happened to the guy on the right?  He used to be a thin dude, right?  Chris Kirkpatrick? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  What is he doing?  He looks like an uncle at someone's wedding right there.  He was always the lame one in the group anyway.  Was he?  He had braids.  Remember he had braids with beads on him and everything?  He always sucked.  Did he suck?  Yeah.  Did you like NSYNC when you were younger?  No.  I can appreciate them more now.  Why?  You can get down to an NSYNC song every now and then.  What's an NSYNC song?  What's one of those songs?  Bye Bye Bye Bye is the problem.  Bye Bye Bye Bye.  That was a biggie.  My shit is crazy.  Drive myself crazy.  Oh.  Oh.  That's my shit.  You rock. 
[00:23:30]  Lance Bass has a show on Sirius XM.  That's what he's been up to.  Oh, does he?  A nightly show.  Is it on OutQ?  I believe it is.  Ah.  He does it live though.  He actually does a real show every night.  Is he?  Wow.  He's in LA, but you know.  He was going to go take that $200,000 trip to space.  He's one of the first ones on that Branson's fucking...  He just wants attention.  He knows.  He's going to pay for that ticket.  No, he knows they're not doing the trips anytime soon.  We could have said that.  Yeah.  Hey, we signed up, man.  First shock jocks. 
[00:24:00]  Right.  In space.  Yeah.  He's not going to have the cash when push comes to show.  Of course.  Do a wacky stunt in space.  People are very happy at our take on the Miley Cyrus because it was so easy just to beat  the shit out of her.  That performance was hot.  Wasn't like...  But her ass was horrendous.  Yeah.  That's a cycle of female pop stars.  Hmm?  Every female pop star goes through that sort of hypersexual thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  At this age.  She really, like, pushed it crazy far. 
[00:24:30]  But, yeah, that one picture of the back, like, they show it, and she was wearing those  rubber panties.  Did you see the split screen with the chicken?  Yeah, with the chicken.  It looked like that.  It also looked like the spot where a tooth used to be right after you pull it.  It was...  Yeah, look, look.  Yeah, that one.  That's where a tooth was.  That was the best one.  Yeah, that's...  That's...  Oh, yeah.  Look out.  And he has a bit of a punch.  Robin Thicke?  Well, yeah, Robin Thicke had a bit of a punch as he was gyrating, trying to dry hump her. 
[00:25:00]  You see that picture of him and the way he grabbed that?  He was grabbing her asshole, that photo with the mirror.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, he had a handful of asshole.  I've grabbed the asshole, but I've never...  Fuck...  He was scooping at each cheek, and the rest of his hand was in the fucking hole.  Yeah.  This guy's great.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[00:25:30]  People are really annoyed with this song at this point.  Oh, I hate it.  Yeah.  This was the song of the summer.  Was it?  No, it wasn't in the...  MTV, but of course it was a...  They gave it to 1D.  Because it was a listener voting thing, right?  And because their movie was coming out, but yeah.  And their movie's coming out, and of course.  One Direction rules.  They ruined all suspense for that moment, because during the pre-show, they were like, oh, it's  listener voting, and so far, One Direction has 8 million votes.  Second place with 4 million. 
[00:26:00]  And you're like, of course.  Why would they announce how many million?  I don't know.  And when you've got a 4 million vote lead on something...  Right.  ...two hours before the deadline, you're done.  The 1D movie is really good.  Enjoy.  Are they more popular than Justin Bieber right now?  At this point, yes.  Way more popular.  I even know that.  Do you think he's kind of looking silly with his hip-hop stuff?  He is in limbo right now.  He just doesn't know what to do with himself.  He's not very tough.  No. 
[00:26:30]  He's not very tough.  He looks tough, though.  I wouldn't fuck with him.  I feel a little bad for him, though, because we all do those humiliating 18-year-old things,  but imagine having the whole fucking planet watch every douchey 18-year-old.  Like, we've all done...  You're 18, you're like, yo, what's up?  But no one sees it.  You think he's tough?  What is that one?  He's got some good guns on him, though.  Oh, God.  What does he do from here?  He's got to come out with a fucking adult record.  He's got to do what Miley did.  Yeah, he's going to have to do some twerking.  Some rubber panties.  The bodyguard putting him back in his SUV like it's a baby. 
[00:27:00]  That's so funny.  Like he's a baby is like, yes, it's the best picture on the Internet.  That was a great pic.  I challenge you to find a better picture than that.  When is that?  That's when he went after the paparazzi.  It's supposed to be a tough guy pic of like, hey, back off, and then like, hey, don't go after him.  And it comes off looking like he's being put in a baby.  He jumped out of the SUV to go after the paparazzi, and his bodyguard there goes, nah, nah, and picked him up like he's a baby and put him back in the car.  He looks like an orange gnome.  Like a little lawn gnome.  I want to hug him. 
[00:27:30]  You little guy, yeah.  Unbelievable.  Oh, shit.  He was not missed at the VMAs.  He wasn't there?  I don't think so.  I didn't see him.  Uh-uh.  No one cared, right?  No one cared.  Nobody asked where he was.  Didn't matter anymore.  Do you like 1D, though, Opie?  Love the 1D.  1D.  I know a lot of their songs, man.  1D.  Oh, yeah.  The butler beating out 1D for the weekend movie receipts.  Well, 1D.  Only their fans are gone, and they only made like 90.  Racist.  Oh, that was beating out.  They only made 19 mil. 
[00:28:00]  19 million?  Thanks.  And that was a 3D movie.  That should have made a little more.  4N beats 1D.  Jesus.  Now Miley Cyrus, the latest on her, she's admitting in an interview that she's messed up and has  issues.  What? 
[00:28:30]  Good.  I guess.  What the fuck?  She should just fucking own it, man.  Right?  Just own it.  I mean, she was number one on Twitter for like a week and a half straight.  Yeah.  That's a good buzz going.  You see Mishka from MSNBC on the Today Show?  No.  She thought somebody at MTV should be fired for that performance.  What?  She's such a frump.  Outrage.  Who?  Mishka from MSNBC, the blonde that we've got on.  Oh, do we have the clip? 
[00:29:00]  She's just a fucking...  Cut!  Ugh, yes.  But I'll bet you she's a dirty one.  She's such an uptight bitch that I'll bet you get a tongue in her ass and I'll bet you  that fucking she goes bananas.  Yeah?  Yeah, I bet you.  I bet you.  She's the worst.  All right, let's hear what she said about this.  Mika, yeah.  Someone should be fired over Cyrus on MTV.  She was outraged.  Oh, by the way, before...  Today's professionals here to tackle the day...  Before we play the clip, I'm really surprised that no one made the Beetlejuice tweet. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, God.  It didn't come up, did it?  It didn't come up.  Holy fuck.  I see so many of the same fucking tweets.  I'm like, you can't possibly think that you just came up with this one.  A thousand people beat you to it.  I like when I tweet something, I'll tweet it, and then literally within five minutes,  someone tweets it back to me like it's new.  Oh, God, she's fucking hot.  Hey, Ed, did you notice that...  Check this out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She is sad. 
[00:30:00]  It looks like Beetlejuice behind her.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Well, no one really made that comparison, so I guess we should make it here today.  And you don't notice that fucking...  Look who's there in the corner watching.  Who?  What's her name from fucking Beetlejuice?  Winona Ryder.  Winona.  The details.  The fucking shoplifter.  Wait, was that really Winona?  Well, she wasn't really there.  They kind of put her there.  Oh.  A little more Photoshop.  Well, all right.  Dude, Miley Cyrus is fucking sexy.  That's what I said.  You like that?  Jeez. 
[00:30:30]  Oh, my God.  The ass is shitty, but you can fix that with some squats.  Yeah.  Get it together a little bit.  I don't mind her little short hairdo either.  Her fucking...  Her I will break you Rocky IV hairdo.  She just has to write a good fucking song.  Let's have a second.  What happened?  Oh, yeah.  Tommy Morrison.  There was a fight that he won by threatening to spit on the other fighter.  Yeah.  He was in Rocky and dead at the age of 44.  He had AIDS, they said.  His mother said he had full-blown AIDS.  I think he tested positive in 96, and he denied it. 
[00:31:00]  He said he didn't have it, but he tested positive, and his mom said it.  I think for a year, he was bedridden with full-blown AIDS.  Wow.  44.  I thought he was older.  He seemed to be...  He was around forever.  He was a big AIDS denier.  There were articles about him that were saying that the reporters would see lesions all over  his arms and stuff, and he'd be like, yeah, mosquitoes love me.  Yeah, my dog did that.  That's terrible, man.  You know, like, he'd completely just cut himself off from that reality. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  All that money, too.  He probably had enough money.  That's probably why he didn't.  Didn't he have money?  No, you don't think he had money?  No, he probably went through all that Rocky money and all that.  Yeah, I don't think he had money, Jimmy.  But no medicine.  He fixed that.  Yeah, he probably, yeah.  Shit.  That's the big difference, I guess.  You look like Magic.  Yeah.  Magic Jansen.  Yeah, he's fine.  Yeah, so Mika.  Outraged.  Was outraged.  Right.  Even Matt Lauer on this one was like, whatever, dude.  What ebbs.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Wait, is Joey Fatone really the announcer for Family Feud now?  Come on, look that up.  Okay.  Because I know he was hosting.  Matthew Bishop on Twitter is usually not a bullshitter.  Come on.  He was hosting a karaoke game show on NBC that went nowhere.  Wait, he was in NSYNC, and now he's the announcer for Family Feud?  This is not possible.  It's not a lateral move.  How do we find that out?  Can you Google it?  Yeah.  Is that the Steve Harvey version?  Oh, yes. 
[00:32:30]  Steve Harvey's the host now.  Man, I was watching that the other day.  Fuck, is that just bad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Steve Harvey.  It's a great gig.  First, I just can't get over the bald-headed Steve Harvey.  Oh, is he bald now?  Oh, yeah.  He took that wig off.  Oh, fuck, what a wig that was.  Yeah, he finally realized that, you know, it's horrendous.  His mustache is, you just can't even figure it out.  The teeth.  I don't know.  We have what appears to be confirmation.  Oh. 
[00:33:00]  We have confirmation that the fat dude from NSYNC is now the announcer for Family Feud.  Well, by the way, former guest of After Opie and Anthony Live, Joey Fatone.  Oh, right.  That's right.  All the big stars roll through.  Do you think Joey will invite Justin Timberlake to maybe hang out on his gig?  We're doing a thing on Family Feud.  Wouldn't that be cool?  Can we hear Joey Fatone being the announcer for Family Feud, please? 
[00:33:30]  You got a clip?  Oh, my God.  It's not a lateral move.  No, it's not.  It is off a cliff.  It's terrible.  Justin Timberlake showed the world what he thinks of NSYNC.  He gave him, I think, 45 seconds.  It was pretty fast.  During that 20-minute montage.  That montage went on forever.  Oh, yeah.  Did they sing a whole song?  I don't even know if they sang the whole song, did they, Sam? 
[00:34:00]  They did not sing.  No, they had a bit of a montage, but not one complete song.  And how long was their...  The montage was actually shorter than any NSYNC song.  It was about two minutes, maybe?  Yeah.  If now.  Okay.  Yeah, Justin Timberlake is...  Closest I can get right now is 2010.  Let's see.  All right.  Let's keep our fingers crossed.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, it is.  No, he says it's Joey Fatone. 
[00:34:30]  And he has to say this is Joey Fatone.  He should ask, would you guys be okay if I don't introduce myself when I'm doing the intro?  Can I say I'm anybody but Joey Fatone?  Lance Bass?  This is Joey Fatone.  Let's hear it again because I didn't catch the beginning.  Okay.  He's doing it up. 
[00:35:00]  He's trying, man.  Yeah, but he doesn't even get that, like, flash to Joey Fatone introing Steve Harvey.  There's no camera time.  No, no, no, no.  Well, you wonder if he's live in studio or if that's just a pre-tape.  He might just pre-tape those fucking...  Maybe.  Maybe.  In L.A.  He taped one of them.  And they've been using the same one.  Every day, it's the same one.  No, he has to do the families.  You've got to do every episode because you've got to...  Oh, man.  You know, it's the Roberts family, you know.  It's the Hitler family.  Yes.  Adolf, Eva, Anthony, and Blondie, the dog. 
[00:35:30]  How did I get in there?  Believe me, they're wondering the same thing.  The perfect race.  And you're there Italian-ing it up.  Grease ball.  We're worried.  Miley Cyrus.  Yeah, yeah.  Mika Broad from MSNBC.  Outraged.  Let's hear this.  It's Hot Topic.  Star Jones and Nancy Snyderman.  It's sitting in for Donnie this morning.  I'm Donnie.  Give it up for Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC's Morning Joe. 
[00:36:00]  Welcome, Mika.  Nice to have you here.  Thank you for having me.  Good to have you here because the first topic is Miley Cyrus and those VMAs and her performance there.  You were very outspoken about this on your show yesterday.  You called her performance disturbing.  It was.  We don't have the original clip.  Let me ask you the next question.  This is the one that went everywhere.  This is the one that I saw.  Okay.  Yeah.  And then some parents groups are now saying someone at MTV needs to be fired because of  what went on the air that night.  How do you feel about it?  Absolutely.  Somebody should be fired.  It's hard to believe there weren't parents at MTV who couldn't have put two and two and 
[00:36:30]  two together.  But didn't we expect this?  MTV pushes the envelope every single year.  Did you not expect that they would try to go to the next level?  There's pushing the envelope and there's porn.  There's raunchy porn that's disgusting and disturbing.  And seeing a young girl, a 20-year-old young woman in her, literally in the process of  her undoing and everyone clapping for it and being disturbed by it and talking about  it and showing it.  Oh, boy.  Pause.  But you work for a network that has no problem seeing kids fucking dying in front of your 
[00:37:00]  eyes from searing gas.  I'd rather see Miley Cyrus than kids fucking dying on your fucking news program.  Well, both.  Let's see both.  Well, I'm just saying, but you know, she doesn't have a leg to stand.  No, she's awful.  I think the kid video they've been showing all over the place is way more horrific than  the Miley Cyrus twerking shit.  What a fuddy-duddy.  Can we play or I want to pretend I'm on panel? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, just play for the second.  Matt, can I jump in there for a second?  Mika, you're a cunt.  Back to you.  Mika, I don't want to show it too late.  Don't show it here on my segment, please, here with you guys.  Please don't show it.  Listen, no one disagrees that it was really ratchet, and I agree with you on that.  But I think it's more to young women thinking that being over-sexualized is a way to be seen.  That star.  That star, Jones?  I'm a lawyer. 
[00:38:00]  It is a way to be seen.  She's a sex symbol, dummy.  What do you think Marilyn Monroe did with her?  She had her fucking stupid hairy beaver blown up over that fucking, over the vent.  That was porn back in the 50s.  The fact that she almost sucked the president's cock at the garden.  Yes.  And can we get a bra that still has some juice in her pussy to comment about this?  Of course they're pissed off.  Those old dried up hags.  There's not an option for them anymore.  No.  Of course they're going to be jealous of it.  But get a few young broads on the panel to discuss it. 
[00:38:30]  We heard, and that's my bra that's...  Oh, but star, that's exactly what we don't want our young girls to be.  That's what she's...  What?  What old ladies...  She's feeling as if in order to be seen in America, to be seen in her business, she must be...  She can't even figure out who she is at this point.  Oh, shut up.  What a dumb old lady.  I think the only thing that surprises me is that we're surprised.  She is a paid performer.  She's trying to bridge the gap.  Let me just say, she's trying to bridge the gap between adolescent star and adult star. 
[00:39:00]  She's on the most provocative award show of the year, taking part in the most provocative  song of summer.  I'm not saying it's right.  I'm just saying the fact that we're in the media...  Matt, will you shut these hands up?  Oh, my God.  I'd have to get a cock, would you?  They're just...  Stop being a pussy, Matt Lauer, and say it's okay.  Shut them up.  It's your gig.  Quiet, Hall, as I'm talking.  Right.  Did you hear the whole time he's talking?  They're just...  Jealous old ladies. 
[00:39:30]  He almost said it's okay, but he wasn't brave enough to say, look, in that arena, it's okay,  which he did.  Yes.  Go ahead.  It's ridiculous.  I've got my parent hat on.  Sorry, I'm not a member of the media right now.  Right now you are.  Sorry, not so.  Where are the parental guidelines to take a trial from Hannah Montana to the next stage  without falling off?  Didn't you see that on television last night?  Sorry, come on, you guys.  Get out of my tent for a second.  Guys.  She actually said, guys. 
[00:40:00]  Come on.  You fucking dried up hang.  Get the parenting shit again.  Enough of the parenting shit.  I'll take care of that part.  Shut up.  And by the way, Miley Cyrus fans watching that are 19 and 20 years old.  Right.  They're not Hannah Montana.  They're not...  What do you think?  They stay three, you fucking idiot.  This is not a beautiful mind where the kid doesn't age, shithead.  Hannah Montana's been dead for many years. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  What?  Four years?  Five years, probably.  Four years?  I don't know.  And nobody has mentioned in this whole thing that the lyrics of the song are about her doing  ecstasy and blow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So she was playing...  No, whatever.  Why should she be married to that role?  That was an older role.  Of course.  Why should she have to stay married to a childhood role?  Right.  We're just pissed off her ass was so shitty.  Exactly.  Right.  Yeah.  Star, she moved on from being a blimp.  What the fuck?  Right.  Like you can't change?  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[00:41:00]  Fucker.  Go ahead.  Come on, Matt Lauer.  Get in there.  Yeah.  Come on, Matt.  Exactly what you fucking...  Wave your cock around.  Exactly.  Man it up for once, would you?  And Star, over-sexualized is one thing.  Is it sexual to stick your face in the back of a life-size teddy bear and stick your tongue  out?  Yes.  We're talking about raunch.  No, no, but we're talking about two different things.  Yes.  We're talking about one is a level of taste and over the line, we all agree on that.  Yes.  The other is the fact that we're all running around talking about it, you know what?  Instead of getting criticized, she should get an A plus for accomplishing exactly what 
[00:41:30]  she wanted to accomplish.  But why do you think she didn't show up?  There's probably a lot of other reasons.  Let's move on.  How about this one?  All right?  Starting next spring.  Yeah.  They move on.  They moved on.  Move on to something.  Meek is the worst.  Her and that fucking other bitch next to her.  Oh, I've been thinking with my...  I have my mother head on now.  Not the media.  I'm a mother.  Oh, God. 
[00:42:00]  I wish you would say that in her mother head and then pull an R. Bud Dwyer.  This is my mother head.  Yuckaroo.  Blow it off.  Yeah, that was really bad.  Shoot it off out of a fucking...  Out of an envelope.  Pull a gun out of an envelope.  Shoot your dumb head off, lady.  That was like magic.  He did.  Pull a gun out of an envelope.  Ta-da.  Ta-da.  Take his head and disappear.  I don't want to get hurt.  Sure you do.  You're going to put a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger.  You're dying for someone to get hurt.  Right. 
[00:42:30]  Exactly.  Miley accomplished exactly what she wanted.  The whole world is still talking about it.  Job well done.  We're on vacation, so we have to talk about it here.  But, yeah, they're still talking about it.  Afterwards, she posted a couple of pictures a couple of days later of her looking all sexy  with a nice ass and everything based on what she was wearing.  And I was like, nah, that's not quite cutting it.  We know.  The memory.  Yeah, yeah.  We know.  We saw chicken ass.  Like, who fucking sent her out of the dressing room going, yeah, that's good. 
[00:43:00]  I understand she wanted to look like a kind of nude, rubberish panties and stuff, but  they were too tight.  They were too tight, which pushed out some shit.  Yeah.  How'd her push look?  I don't know.  She strikes me as the type that's now firing anybody around her that doesn't say, yes,  that's good.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  That's true.  A lot of yes men.  Yeah.  And women.  And women.  Sure, sure.  The new opening Anthony show, sensitive to all needs.  Imagine they bring a broad in to run the channel. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my God.  There, let's see.  It would almost be great.  Oh, my God.  It would almost be great.  Oh, look.  We're getting a little puss shot.  Let me see.  Sam, I can't see.  There you go, buddy.  Okay.  She's obviously covering her.  I like the tongue out.  Oh, would she be fun to just smooch?  Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.  Smooch.  Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss.  You'd like to smooch?  Let me see the picture on the right.  That's the ass picture.  That's not bad, though.  It's not as bad as I thought.  That looks better that way because she's bent over a little.  But when she was walking, it was just horrendous.  Yeah.  God.  She just picked the wrong fucking panties or whatever. 
[00:44:00]  She's not showing her nips, though, or her pussy lips.  You can tell she has like a little cup on it, a little girl cup.  It's a girl cup.  That takes those meaty lips and mushes them in there.  Yeah.  It hustles the lips in.  Get in there, get in there, get in there.  One of those girl bras is more like, there's not much cup, but a lot of other shit going on.  Yeah, yeah.  Straps and borders.  Makes it look like there's a little more happening in the area than there actually is.  Right, yeah, yeah.  I like that. 
[00:44:30]  She looks like Justin Bieber in that left picture, though.  That could easily be Bieber.  Oh, that's creepy.  Yeah.  The fuck is that about?  I don't know.  I mean, but Justin Bieber is a very feminine young man.  Yeah.  And she has a butch hairdo and wide, eager eyes as Justin does.  They're meeting in the middle there.  Yeah.  Those two.  Yeah.  Yes, androgyny.  Yeah.  What does this have to do with Eminem?  Shady's back.  Oh.  Yeah, he is.  Is he?  He put out a new song.  It's almost time to change the name of the channel, right?  It is, right?  I would think so. 
[00:45:00]  Didn't we like this song or no?  This is a new song.  It came out.  You haven't heard Berserk yet?  No.  Yeah.  Well, I thought we heard it and played it.  No, this is newer than that song.  This is the single.  That song was off like a video game soundtrack.  Oh, right.  Okay.  This is what he's pushing.  This is the main song.  He's calling his album the Marshall Mathers LP 2, and that was his biggest album.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That's because he wants it to be a Justin Bieber.  That's a ballsy name, and this is the single off of it.  Okay.  We've got to talk to Who Kid.  He's got to change the name of that channel. 
[00:45:30]  Who Kid's not going to say one bad thing about anybody associated with Eminem?  Yeah, no.  Let's get him in here, though.  Let's break him down.  He's not awake at this hour.  No.  No.  He's just flying around the world.  He was in Turkey.  You've got to follow Who Kid on Instagram.  I know.  Every weekend, he's in another country.  Yeah.  He's in Turkey, and then he comes back to do his show yesterday or something.  Yeah.  He was amazing.  Wow.  He's just DJing these big parties?  Yeah.  He's a major DJ, isn't he?  Yeah, he's huge.  He makes a lot of money internationally. 
[00:46:00]  He flies what, private?  He flies private when he's touring with 50 Cent.  Like, G-Unit would have a private plane, depending on the deal.  Does he warm up for 50?  Or is he doing his own gigs?  Well, he does both.  He does his own gigs that he gets paid a lot of money for.  Those are like big club gigs.  And then when 50's on tour, he DJs for 50 while 50's on stage.  That's a huge...  A lot of them probably don't even know the name Who Kid.  They're just like, he's 50 Cent's DJ?  Exactly.  Wow, that's a great gig.  Yeah, but he's all over the world, man. 
[00:46:30]  He's in these cool places.  Nice.  I was hanging with him at the VMA after party.  He was?  On Sunday.  I was.  Where was that?  You went to a VMA after party, Sam Roberts?  That's right.  Are you a mover and shaker now?  That's right.  I saw some of the pit photos.  Hanging with Nick Cannon, my homeboy.  That's what I saw.  Mm-hmm.  We're buddies.  He's a nice guy.  He really is.  He's just a nice man, Nick Cannon.  We went to the VMAs once, but we weren't allowed in the CBS area.  Oh, God.  Even though we went for CBS. 
[00:47:00]  Because you brought two fucking fat horses and cost me a Mick Jagger picture of those  slops.  Killed them both, I see.  No, after that.  We had GMs running out to see us in the lobby, begging us not to come in, and we weren't  allowed to come in.  I'm like, but we work for this company.  Oh, God.  That's right.  It was the Howard thing.  Yeah, I was.  They were very panicky.  He was back there.  To have us and Howard in the same fucking room.  So, guess who lost?  Oh, Pete and Anthony lost.  We were in a fucking lobby watching all the A-listers going to the CBS box. 
[00:47:30]  That's so guess who lost concept has just followed you everywhere you've gone in your  career.  The Boston GM at the time, I forgot his name years ago.  He comes running out.  He has flop sweat, begging us not to fucking make a scene.  Hum-na-hum-na-hum-na-hum.  Remember this flop sweat?  Yes.  And we're like, what, man?  We want to go in there.  Yeah, we want to go in.  We work for the company.  Oh, my God.  It never felt like we worked for that company.  It never did.  We were always a problem. 
[00:48:00]  Do you think we were the problem?  I don't think we were the problem.  I really don't either.  Thank you for saying that.  Let me weigh in if I could.  I don't think you were necessarily the problem.  I don't think we were the problem.  However, we were bringing in major money for that company.  Yes, yes.  Major ratings, too.  We were not supervised.  No, but we weren't allowed to be anywhere.  We were spoiled little brats that were unsupervised.  You were a bit of the problem.  Maybe not all of the problem.  Tony was certainly part of it.  The GM's name is Tony.  Yeah, Tony comes running out into the lobby because the word got out that we were trying 
[00:48:30]  to just, I don't know, join our fellow employees.  Yes.  And he comes running out.  I swear to you, he had flop sweat begging us because he was in a tough situation because  he had both shows up there in Boston.  Like Howard and Mel were in there in the back and they're yucking it up and the last  thing they wanted to see was us walk in there.  Right.  How does that feel that you guys can't go and hang out someplace without people who employ 
[00:49:00]  you going, all right, what are these guys up to?  Yeah.  It wasn't the competition.  No, it was your boss.  And then we went to, and let it be known, I was going to, we were going to save it for  the book, but the time we showed up at Howard's press conference, we weren't there to do anything.  No.  We were actually went to check it out.  And also we're sitting there wondering why the press conference isn't starting.  And we find out later that he, Howard was in his limo outside the place, waiting for  us to leave before he would come in panicking on the phone, talking to our general manager. 
[00:49:30]  And then that's why I don't want them here.  One of many reasons why Jeremy could barely say hi to us in the hallways these days, because  he had a run down.  Where was it?  The Plaza.  Yeah, it was at the Plaza.  And Jeremy had a run like five blocks to get us the fuck out of there because Howard  called Ken Stevens, our GM, yelling and screaming that we were there.  And let it be known, I've said this many times too, we went and we weren't even going to cause 
[00:50:00]  a problem.  We weren't going to do anything.  We were checking it out.  Have you ever heard of a story called The Boy Who Cried Wolf?  I guess.  I've heard of that story, yes.  Maybe that was it.  It might be an instance of...  We grabbed sandwiches.  Remember, we grabbed sandwiches.  We even sat in the back and everyone's looking at us like we're the scourge of society.  I'm like, why isn't the press conference starting?  I'm just trying to eat a sandwich.  I'm like, what the hell?  Why isn't this starting?  And then a guy comes over and goes, hey, man, I'm a huge fan of you guys' show, but we 
[00:50:30]  need to know.  You're not going to do anything, are you?  I'm like, no, we're just here to hang out.  And then security's like, well, now you've got to leave.  Security manhandled us out of there.  They're like, you have to leave right now.  I'm like, what about my sandwich?  Enjoying your sandwiches.  Why is this late?  What happened to the sandwiches?  And then we walked out the front of the plaza and Howard's limo was right there.  He was waiting for us to leave.  This is a goddamn true story.  I got major backup on this one.  I'm like, holy fuck.  We weren't even going to do anything. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  He thought we were going to make a disturbance.  No.  At this press conference, much like Stuttering John did at everyone else's.  Right.  Right.  Yeah.  God forbid someone does it at his.  But we were just there, you know, because there were times we were going to try to get  along with everybody.  Yeah.  Just wasn't in the cards, I guess.  Yep.  I don't know.  What were we talking about?  Eminem?  Yes.  Oh, the new album.  Eminem.  Yep.  This song is really all over the fucking place.  It's sloppy.  I don't know pop music. 
[00:51:30]  I got to admit that.  I have a good ear for these things.  I like a catchy tune.  I like a catchy song.  Yeah.  I'm a fan of a catchy song, but this thing is all over the fucking place.  What's wrong with it?  I don't know.  He's sampling like Billy Squire and the Beastie Boys are in there.  And then he's like, I don't know, trying to be tough, but he's not really a tough guy.  There is.  He was a tough guy once, I guess.  He like, he like pistol whipped a dude back in.  I don't know.  Eight mile, bitch.  But since then, he hasn't really done anything, but he's still a tough guy. 
[00:52:00]  I don't know.  There is a catchiness to it if you listen to it multiple times.  Yeah.  But it's not a good song.  They need to put, I'll tell you something catchy, is if you open the song like this.  It's no blurred lines.  No, it's not blurred lines.  What's the hottest song in America right now?  Pop song wise.  God is Dead, End of the Beginning.  Right now.  Black Sabbath?  Yeah. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  I don't know.  Oh, it has to be Roar.  With fucking, uh, fucking Bartlett.  Bartlett.  That was hilarious.  Hold on.  Wait, before we move on from the VMAs, fucking our pal was, was, was, uh, in, uh, Katy Perry's  corner for that, that whole fight, uh, scenario.  He was the corner guy.  He was the corner guy.  Yeah.  That's fucking, that's our pal.  Yeah, look at him.  He was basically doing his Burgess Meredith.  I would just shove my fucking nose right up her ass right there.  That's Rob Bartlett from Imus's show who does our show when Imus is on vacation. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he was in character the entire performance.  I was watching him the whole time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a professional.  He really is.  I couldn't believe it was him.  I'm like, holy fuck, good for Rob Bartlett.  I looked for a second.  I was like, God, that guy looks like, just like Rob Bartlett.  I was like, oh, fuck, wait, that guy is Rob Bartlett.  I thought the same thing.  And it was a guy looking at me on the subway, jerking off.  I was also right.  I was disappointed by the performance.  By Rob?  By Katy Perry. 
[00:53:30]  Katy, yeah.  She wasn't showing off her lady parts.  Well, you know.  There was some, her boobs were pushed down a little too much and the skirt was a bit long.  There was some jiggling with the jump roping, though.  A little bit.  Unlike.  She was wearing a sports bra.  Yeah.  Unlike Miley.  She was keeping everything pushed, pushed in.  She used her singing talent.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Right.  Don't need no gimmicks.  Well, that is a pretty big gimmick.  Boxing ringing.  That dumb roar song is fucking great.  That's probably not.  I'm embarrassed to say it, but fuck, is that a good song? 
[00:54:00]  Or Lady Gaga.  You have to.  I don't like the Lady Gaga.  Lady who?  Well, the applause song is growing on me, but.  I like that.  But Katy Perry kicked her ass with this one.  It's a good song, but roar destroyed it.  But is this the one that's also supposedly taken from the other girl, right?  Yeah, but the other girl is cool.  She's like, leave me out of it.  Help yourself.  She's like, I'm cool with this shit.  Treat yourself to my song.  Because she's done really well, so she doesn't give a fuck.  Right.  But Lady Gaga got killed when her song sounded like Madonna, and she's not getting killed because 
[00:54:30]  her song sounds like, people just hate Lady Gaga, and they shouldn't.  It's true.  She's a big, pussied, good egg.  Can we hear a little roar going into break, and then after the break, we'll do the M&M  thing, because our food's here, and we're babbling, and all that shit.  Oh, did you have a vacation, by the way?  Yeah, why?  Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  Good, good.  Hang on.  I had a staycation.  We could do vacation stories.  Did you have a good vacation, Jim Norton?  Just an amazing week.  Oh, yeah.  I saw some pics.  Why?  Why? 
[00:55:00]  Just an amazing...  You got stories?  They're not great stories, but I'll say it's in one of the top weeks of my life.  What?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have to find out.  Here's a little tease.  But first, can we play Roar?  Play it.  Don't ask.  You're the boss.  You tell him what you want.  Play it.  Just don't call us faggots on Twitter.  Don't call us faggots on hold my breath, scared to rock the boat and make a mess.  So I sit quietly, agree politely. 
[00:55:30]  I guess that I forgot I had a choice.  I let you push me past the breaking point.  I stayed for nothing, so I fell for everything.  You held me down, but I got up.  Already brushing off the dust.  You hear my voice, you hear that sound.  Like thunder gonna shake the ground.  You held me down, but I got up.  Get ready, cause I've had enough.  I see it all. 
[00:56:00]  I see it now.  I got the eye of the tiger.  A fighter.  Dancing through the fire.  Cause I am a champion.  And you're gonna hear me roar.  Louder.  Louder than a lion.  Cause I am a champion.  And you're gonna hear me roar. 
[00:56:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  In moments.  In moments.  In moments.  In moments.  Now, now, back to our show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Now, back to our show.  Continues.  Now, back to our show.  Now, back to our show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Continues.  I like our spies.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What do we got? 
[00:57:00]  What do we got?  New intel?  Oh, yeah.  How does this guy write?  Let's see here.  Uh, let's see here.  Hold on a minute.  Let's see.  Okay.  Thank you, DK Dullis.  D-O-L-L-A-S on the Twitter.  Uh, the morning mashup just bragged up the new Eminem song.  I think you guys will have a slightly different opinion.  Oh, no.  Did they?  Well, that's their job.  I missed the morning mashup.  I, I, I'm not commuting anymore.  It's it.  What?  Oh, man.  Back in the city. 
[00:57:30]  It's truly amazing that the morning mashup and Hits 1.  Yeah.  Will only play rap songs if it's by white people.  Really?  It's like they play Macklemore.  They play Eminem.  No black people.  Yeah, yeah.  That Macklemore is a weird dude, huh?  Ah, fuck him.  Why?  He just rubbed me the wrong way.  What was he saying about that?  I mean, VMAs.  It just, he seems annoying as fuck.  Stupid equality or something?  It's a pro-gay song.  Oh, whatever.  Is he gay?  No, but he has a gay uncle.  All right.  I'm sure we all have one. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  I'm sure we all have one.  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, what a special guy.  He's getting applauded for this song.  He's talking to kids about it being okay and accepting.  I think gays are accepted for the most part.  Let's be real here.  There's always going to be intolerance, but fuck.  Yeah, but in hip hop, there's a huge, you know.  Yeah.  They're hated all over the world, dude.  What?  That's a rough.  Gays?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, they're as far as possible by death in certain places and fucking-  Oh, well, all over the world, sure.  But you're not going to change that fucking savage beliefs and behavior? 
[00:58:30]  Not with that attitude.  Oh, well.  What part does he sing in the Hands Up ceiling song?  The verses.  Which one?  All of them that aren't the chorus.  I don't know which one.  That's him?  This is the chorus.  That's him?  No, he doesn't sing the chorus.  Yeah, but this is the best part of the song.  Maybe.  All right.  So, all right.  You made my point.  Why does he get all the credit when that's the best part of the song?  He just brings people in to do all of his choruses.  All three singles. 
[00:59:00]  This is the coolest part of the song, and I thought he was the McElroy guy.  Who does that first?  I don't know what his name is.  He just hires people to do the play.  He's not a famous guy.  So, which part is he?  This is him.  No, that's the shitty part.  He shouldn't get top billing.  It's his song.  Yeah, but the other guy has the cool part.  Who is the other guy?  I'll show you.  Are you listening to this part or the other part?  I've got to be honest. 
[00:59:30]  I'm not listening to either.  All right.  Yeah.  I'm not a big Macklemore fan.  But the guy that's doing the hook should get the credit.  That's why Jay-Z is overrated.  Rated.  God damn it.  I agree.  The New York, New York little lady should be getting the credit.  Her name's Alicia Keys, and she gets a lot of credit.  She looked like shit the other morning.  I was watching.  Ray Dalton is this guy's name.  Yeah, all right.  So, this is a Ray Dalton song.  Ray Dalton goes to all the performances.  He's there to accept the awards. 
[01:00:00]  But he's a guy who just sings the hook.  Yeah.  Yeah, the hook is way cooler than this.  I would assume Macklemore wrote the hook.  The hook, that's part of the people remember.  Listen.  Bring back the guy.  See?  This is what you know of the song right here.  Macklemore, this is his style.  He's had three singles, and they've all been huge, and they've all had somebody else.  What do you mean, no, they haven't?  I only know one, so that means...  You don't know Thrift Shop. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know, do I?  Thrift Shop's even bigger than this song.  How's the Thrift Shop go?  Play the Thrift Shop.  I saw the movie.  The movie?  Yeah.  Oh, that was the gift shop.  I don't know this.  This exit through the Thrift Shop was different.  Yeah, that's right, man.  You don't know this?  Is that him?  No.  See, that's bullshit!  Who's that doing that one?  Uh...  Is that Ray Dalton again?  No.  He hires different guys to do the hooks on every song.  Is that him here?  This is Macklemore. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, it's the more that...  Crap.  And the guy who does the hook should get the credit.  The current song, Same Love.  It's a woman doing the chorus.  All right, then it's her song.  I don't know.  This is a giant...  This was a giant song.  It wasn't a giant song.  I didn't hear it.  There you go, Jimmy.  You tell him.  I haven't heard most of 2000s.  Yeah, I can't say that's a strong argument.  I have so.  Oh, my God.  What did he do?  Oh, I know.  He's rocking a mustache and a soul patch. 
[01:01:30]  He's doing a fucking...  What are you doing?  Why don't you...  Let him slowly eek out.  He's fucking...  Slowly coming out.  Yeah.  Are you the president of Syria?  I felt like changing it up a little bit.  One of the three Musca queers.  So don't you have to start really shaping the mustache?  That's too much work.  I know.  It's a little bit of a pain, but...  If you're going to grow a mustache,  wouldn't you just grow a mustache?  Why do you have to shave down parts of it?  Style that shit.  It's called having personal style.  I think if I let it grow,  it would be too wide and gross. 
[01:02:00]  It doesn't pass the corners of his mouth.  Right.  And it goes from the nostril...  It goes the full length of the nostril  to the top of the lip,  and then by the edge of the mouth,  it's down to a point.  Right.  So it's very old school.  It looks like too much work.  Severe.  It's a very severe angle there.  And you have a soul patch on the bottom.  And then the soul patch on the bottom,  which is like a little triangle thing going on there.  The soul patches are just cool.  You don't come up...  And you don't come up with anything on your own,  so where do you get the look from?  No, I just felt like doing it.  I was rocking the beard for a little while,  and I was like,  maybe you shave it down.  But you saw someone else had it, 
[01:02:30]  and I'm going to try that.  I'm going to try that shit.  No, I just felt like changing it up a little bit.  That's all.  Yeah?  All right.  Do we have a new batch?  Yes, we do.  Where's my blueberries?  Coming right in.  I love you.  Not today.  No, not today.  All right.  I'm just wondering.  One of them's a girl.  Really?  How come only one's a girl, by the way?  One is enough.  It's not enough.  You can't go from two girls to one girl.  Why only one?  We looked at the applicants and picked the best three.  No, we should have went.  The applicant.  We should have went from two girls to three girls, 
[01:03:00]  not two girls to one girl.  Yeah, you always went two girls to none,  because none applied.  She was the last minute.  Oh, all right.  So you just went out there and got us a fucking young lady.  It went out there and got us one.  Good move.  I hope she can spread some sunshine.  Yeah, I hope she's not a big dud.  I hope she's not like Mika.  Oh, God.  Good guys.  Did you guys see Alicia Keys on GMA  trying to look sexy?  And I actually dry heaved watching her.  Oh, no.  What was she doing?  She's got a huge ass.  And it's misshapen. 
[01:03:30]  She looks like a pear.  Yeah.  And then she's got some weird bangy haircut.  Maybe I should be on the morning mashup today.  Too much pop culture.  A lot of pop culture today.  You didn't see this?  She's got now a medley of two.  Watch how she...  Biggest tits.  You're going to love it.  Oh, no, no.  You got to get her...  She's her biggest tits.  Yeah, that's what it sounded like.  A medley of her biggest tits.  No, you got to get her walking out like all sexy and shit.  She stays on the piano the whole time.  No, she doesn't.  I don't think they show on this clip.  Oh, no, no.  When she first appeared, she walked...  Watch this. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  That shot not bad.  Look.  Jimmy just...  Look at her wiggling her huge pink hips.  Oh, my God.  That's horrible.  Black dudes love that, huh?  Yeah.  Sam, you got a medley.  She's a beautiful girl, too.  Until you get past the belly button, then it just gets completely out of control.  The hair is terrible.  Her hairline is not good either.  Look at that.  Wow.  She's got some fucking...  Sam, you like a bigger ass.  That's bad, though, right? 
[01:04:30]  I wouldn't say it's bad, but it's not making me drool.  And then when she sits on the piano, the whole thing spreads way out to the sides.  Takes up the whole bench.  Yeah.  That's our pop culture break.  I hope you appreciate it.  That's good.  I can't believe you guys have a problem with the Macklemore song.  Yeah, because he's not the...  Macklemore.  The guy with the hook.  That's what you remember.  No, I can't believe you guys have a problem with the pro-gay song.  I got Steve Irwin's back. 
[01:05:00]  That fucking old bat.  Oh, my God.  That's that Nadia guy?  What a fucking mess.  That's not a guard.  That's a woman.  That's a guy and I, with her puffy whip.  That's the woman that swam from Cuba to the keys.  Her salt-filled lips.  Yeah.  I guess if you're in the fucking ocean long enough, your lips blow up.  Right.  It's crazy.  She's fucking horrendous looking.  Yeah, she's not the first to swim from fucking Cuba to Florida.  Let's all stop.  But she's an old broad, I guess.  Old record.  You can do more than 100 miles. 
[01:05:30]  But not this stretch.  This stretch is impossible.  Swimmers have been trying since 1950, and no one's ever made it across.  Go do the mall dives.  Go do the Guam.  Find another nicer stretch.  Wow.  But Cuba was in my heart.  And when I look at the map, that's what spoke to my imagination.  Her lips are huge.  So I didn't want to give up on it.  They're very salty.  And this time, I got lucky.  Was she stunned by the jellyfish?  I mean, the waves were tough.  The jellyfish mask that I'm so lucky to have made me take in a lot of salt water. 
[01:06:00]  I was very sick.  But the Gulf Stream was my friend.  And usually it's not.  Usually you're out there going in circles, going east of the Bahamas.  This time, the Gulf Stream went north.  That's scary.  Right where I was going.  Well, the conditions were right, but it takes more than just conditions for Jim and Ben to be able to get a track.  That is all true grit and determination.  Was she stopping or not?  That you made it through.  What are you saying to yourself?  What are you doing during these 53 hours that you're in the water trying to make it across? 
[01:06:30]  And she's 64 years old?  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, it's a very isolating experience, even though I have 35 people around me, loving, working like a machine.  The kayakers with their shark devices, the shark divers at night in with me in the water patrolling.  Oh, wow.  The biggest jellyfish expert, the number one jellyfish expert in the world.  Dr. Angel Yanagihara with me, literally in the water, scooping up jellyfish, coming and putting creams on my face. 
[01:07:00]  I've got a team.  Bonnie, my head handler, my soul.  Scooping up jellyfish?  Where did you find these people?  I know.  Why did she have a jellyfish mask?  Because the last time she tried.  She wanted to look like a jellyfish.  Oh, it's Halloween in the ocean.  Yes.  The last time she tried, she got stung so badly that she had to stop.  Oh, really?  So then she goes, all right, fuck it, I'll get a jellyfish mask.  You know, these silly records, I call them the silly records.  Yeah.  Like, I'm not impressed, because if you want to do it, then you should just jump in the water and do it without all these experts and guys looking out for sharks and all that. 
[01:07:30]  You'd probably be dead.  I know, I understand that, but it takes a little bit of, it takes away from the whole thing, doesn't it?  Your team is somehow helping you make it through.  Every 15 minutes, every hour, let's not give up.  Your success and the journey, even though we know that the result and the victory is so much sweeter, has captured the country, has captivated a nation.  No, not really. 
[01:08:00]  As people have been almost sweating.  What's the jellyfish mask?  So what is your message?  We're still talking about Miley Cyrus.  I saw it, yeah, I guess you, uh, I guess you put something over your face so you don't get stung in the face by jellyfish.  You know, Kate, I think the message I carry, um, and the reason so many people are attracted to this story, is that it has nothing to do with sport.  It really doesn't.  The people who follow me aren't sports towns, you know, checking the ERAs and baseball pitchers every day.  They're human beings who are dealing with their own heartaches and their own obstacles in life. 
[01:08:30]  And they want to know how to get through.  And I think I'm the person who represents A, you never give up.  The way I was, it's not AIDS, like, fucking, oh, those mosquitoes lumping.  It's important to your heart.  You can see what's inside yourself.  And then they say which ones, the ones next to Tommy Morrison, who are dead, coughing.  Coughing.  Those sick mosquitoes love me.  Ah, good for Diane and I had, what the hell.  Yeah, you know.  She's been trying for, since she was 28 years old, I think.  64.  64. 
[01:09:00]  Was her first, and she looked exactly the same at 28, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  She didn't really.  Not really ever a very attractive woman.  She was never a looker.  No.  No.  No.  Very motivated.  Good for you.  Congratulations, whatever that means.  She's terrible looking.  That's a face made for the ocean.  She just eyeballs a shark and it fucking moves along.  Yeah, whatever.  I'm through with the ocean.  Never going to be seasick again. 
[01:09:30]  See how happy I look?  Yeah, exactly.  I really didn't come back.  Oh, my God.  They're still talking about it.  I know, with her dumb, androgynous watch.  I said that word a lot today.  I apologize.  It's all good.  I wanted to hear the Eminem song.  Oh, you do?  Oh, that's right.  That's what we were doing.  And then I want to hear about Jimmy's great week.  He says it's one of the greatest weeks ever.  And then, of course, you know, the big news with Anthony.  I mean.  Oh, well, my new addition to my little household.  Yeah, so we got that as well.  Little Beavis.  So why don't we get through the Eminem song, and then we'll move on to all the shit. 
[01:10:00]  Now the ship's about to kick off.  This party looks wet.  Let's take it back and straight.  Sounds a little Beastie Boys right there.  A little.  Sounds a little Beastie Boys.  Is that the actual Beastie Boys, or is that Eminem trying to do the Beastie Boys?  Is Eminem singing Beastie Boys?  No, it's the actual Beastie Boys riff.  Rick Rubin produced it.  No, I understand, but who's singing the Beastie Boys part?  That's definitely.  No, that's Eminem trying to sound like the Beastie Boys, but the riff is the Beastie Boys.  Wait, Rick Rubin produced Eminem's thing? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, this song.  Okay.  It's called A Joint.  A Joint.  Nice.  Now the ship's about to kick off.  This party looks wack.  Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch.  I'm about to bloody just check up.  Everybody get back.  That's why my pin needs a pad.  Because my rhyme's on the red tag.  It's like I get with a dicks and I'm about to be geek.  Like I'm a magician.  Critics, I turn to be geek.  Oh, man.  It's dope, man.  Oh.  How many songs? 
[01:11:00]  Exactly.  This is busy.  Very busy.  Oh, how many does that?  I've had it with this guy. 
[01:11:30]  I'm an out?  Yeah.  I told you.  I say bucket before we kick the bucket.  Wipe the shorts and not cause I'm wrong.  Everybody, everybody.  It's dope.  I guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?  I swear, when that happened, I thought it was old school where radio stations would bleed into each other.  I really thought, that's why I asked you this morning.  I'm like, is he sampling Billy Squire?  Because I wasn't sure I was getting some weird bleed in on my satellite.  It sounds horrible. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Like it's not done well or something.  I don't know what they're going for.  It's Rick Rubin.  Rick Rubin actually fucking went like that was good.  And like Eminem is like, what does he got left to say?  He's going after Khloe Kardashian now in this song.  Why?  What's he saying about Khloe?  He needs a little battle.  He needs a little battle.  Love the Khloe.  Khloe's my favorite Kardashian.  Love the Khloe.  The only one I could tolerate.  Her in 1D?  Yes.  These soft, easy targets. 
[01:12:30]  What are you doing?  Fire, everybody.  Get your fire.  I guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?  Khakis, pressed, Nike shoes, crispy and fresh lace.  So I guess it ain't.  Instead I have to shave a cologne and it made him just faint.  Plus I showed up with a coat, fresh and in wet paint.  So it's love as a chess game.  Checkmate.  But girl, your body's banging.  Jump me in.  Bang, bang, bang.  Yes, sir.  I was thinking the same thing.  Who's he trying to sound like there?  I don't know.  I don't even know if he's M&M.  Isn't he trying to sound like different hip hop guys?  I think that's more just him. 
[01:13:00]  I don't know.  It sounded like.  And he does like silly voices.  He loves doing little voices.  That whole style, it's not this lasting thing with M&M.  When he first did it, it was kind of unique and quirky and stuff.  But now it's like you hear it and I just sound like, oh, I hear this.  Like it sounds so dated.  He's trying to sound like Snoop there a little bit.  Was he?  That's what I hear.  That bang, bang is very early Snoop Dogg style.  I think he's trying to imitate a few of the old OGs. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah?  Can I ask some of the past OGs?  Did you just say a very Snoop Dogg style?  Can you go back a little bit?  I couldn't hear it.  I may have heard that wrong, but it sounded like E-Rock said Snoop Dogg style.  Like, yeah.  Yeah, like he's a smoky.  Nice.  He can't even say three words.  Maybe not.  He can't get a three word sentence out without getting attacked.  I may be wrong.  I may be wrong. 
[01:14:00]  And you wonder, E-Rock, why didn't you tell me?  Well, E-Rock's a beaten dog that you're like, why don't you come to me when I call you?  Because you smack me in the face every time.  It's never been good news.  Never.  Oh, E-Rock.  Oh, you got it?  Yeah, I got it.  All right, let's hear it.  All right, hold on.  That's what I hear.  That bang, bang is very early Snoop Dogg style.  I think he's trying to imitate Snoop Dogg style.  It wasn't too bad.  A little cooler than it should be.  Just a little.  He brought it down a little bit. 
[01:14:30]  Snoop Dogg style.  Just a little bit.  Just a little.  Just a little.  Yeah, smooth Nagel.  Yeah.  It's a doggy dog world.  We've only been back for an hour and a half.  I know, right?  He wants to be back with his Atari.  Well, they blew through all the news stories, so here we go.  That's it, right?  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Made him just faint.  Plus, I showed up in a coat freshening with paint.  Sweet love is a chess game.  Checkmate. 
[01:15:00]  But girl, your body's banging.  Jump me in.  Dang.  Bang, bang.  Yes, sir.  We bob.  I was thinking the same thing.  So come get on this pitch rock.  Bob with the bob.  Dang, dang.  Pow, pow, pow, pow.  Chicka, pow, chicka, wow, wow.  Catch a girl.  Won't want to propel.  Prepare, bow.  Ready, slow it down.  Throw in the towel.  T-t-tow, towel.  Slow it down.  I don't know how.  How, how?  At least I know that I don't know.  Question is, are you both so smart enough to feel stupid?  Hope so.  Now, hope.  Kick shoes off.  Let's hit her.  All night.  Rick Rubin's officially overrated.  Wow.  Rick Rubin's done a lot of good stuff. 
[01:15:30]  Enough already, though.  Everyone's using Rick Rubin.  When everyone starts using the guy, then it's not special anymore.  Rick Rubin did a good job on Kanye's album.  Rick Rubin did a great job for a lot of people.  Sabbath.  Yeah.  He gave him a masterpiece.  Yeah.  But this, this song just didn't work.  This song is awful.  Yeah, I don't like this song.  Eminem is not Eminem anymore.  He's not, it's not that time anymore.  He's done.  No, he's done.  Unless he does something unique again.  I mean, this is.  Just get out.  Just get out. 
[01:16:00]  Sing it.  All night long.  Rock this house until we knock it down.  So turn up all you love.  Remember that?  Break the pace up like crazy.  Let yourself go.  Let yourself go.  I'll stay bucket before we kick the bucket.  Price for shorts and not gold for gold.  Everybody.  Everybody.  I hate this.  I'm not liking this either.  I'm out to scratch over a toe.  That's great.  A little more shit. 
[01:16:30]  When I say that love is powerful, it's cough syrup, it's powerful.  All I knew was I fell asleep and woke up in that money car load.  With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh, sorry, yo, we done both set the bar load.  For as hard drugs are, though, that's the past, but I don't get enough code.  Need in that future with it tomorrow.  And go, I ain't got no money to borrow, but I am trying to find a way to get you a loan.  Cardio.  Oh.  Marshall Mathers.  Get out of the body now.  Get the bar so plathered.  Can't go.  Is there any more he could have thrown in on this fucking thing? 
[01:17:00]  Wow.  Yeah, it's too much happening.  It's just a bunch of shit piled on top of each other.  What is it?  A lot of little songs?  You said, fuck it, I'll make it into one song?  I guess.  What is going on there?  It's just not well done.  He's interesting enough where I would just want to hear him just doing his thing.  I don't like it.  It's nonsense.  I don't need it.  Yeah.  I don't need it. 
[01:17:30]  Let yourself go.  I'll say, fuck it, before we kick the bucket.  Wipe through short to not go for real.  Everybody, everybody, go. 
[01:18:00]  We're going to rock this house until we knock it down.  So turn the volume down.  Cause it's been to the end.  Break the pace up like crazy.  Let yourself go.  Let yourself go.  I'll say, fuck it, before we kick the bucket.  Wipe through short to not go for real.  Everybody, everybody  I don't like the feeling of Squire and Max either  At least you know that  Yeah, I don't like that though  At least that is catchy  Right, I mean that's the kind of catchy 
[01:18:30]  Bop your head part  Well, if you're into pop music, you're waiting for the catchy part  Right, Macklemore?  Oh  So pissed  I really thought he was the hook guy  No, he's not the hook guy  Why was there a shark walking on TV?  I mean, someone has to mention it  What the fuck was that?  It's a new species  What do you mean it's a new species?  They just found it  They said it's a walking conservation group  That's our fucking replacement  What do you mean it's a new species?  New to us? 
[01:19:00]  How long has it been just walking around?  Well, it blends into the ocean floor  We probably never saw it before  It's a walking shark  They're called lawyers  No, I don't know what they call it  That was pretty fucked up  It was walking  Like on the bottom of the ocean  Does he have little walking feet?  He walks around  Yeah, he's kind of like using his little fins  But are the fins a little more impressive than the regular fins?  Yeah, he's got the front ones  And then he's got the back ones  And they use them like feet  And they walk around  Oh, fuck  I just saw that for the first time  You know, a few billion years 
[01:19:30]  We might have to worry about that guy  They're lucky I didn't find that first  Or I would have named it something really annoying  And the Tootsie Shark  Because he's got little Tootsies  Little Tootsies  Everybody  Yeah  Sometimes you've got to let your body at work  Just stand alone  I've got very good news  Someone's calling in  Throw the towel in  Back off, right  I disagree  Good news  More like Sam's anti-M&M stance  That's right  Surprise phone call  Very good news  Hi, who's this? 
[01:20:00]  Oh, no  There's this campaign that I keep seeing  That I think you might want to take a look at  This gets right into the story  Show prep  With this guy and his son  Playing about Stop and Frisk  And that's a big problem  When I really feel that  That's how we catch every freaking person  That commits a crime  They've made Stop and Frisk a huge  Huge issue during the mayoral campaign 
[01:20:30]  Yes, during the election there, Bobo  Wow  Why are you calling with this  In the middle of nowhere?  What?  It gives a shit  I don't appreciate this  It's an annoying campaign ad that I keep seeing  Seeing  All right, let me find the Stop and Frisk campaign ad  First of all, that's What's-His-Name's son  That's why it's important to that guy  Yes  Bill de Blasio  Bill de Blasio's got a son with a big afro 
[01:21:00]  He's very  Yeah, because I guess Bill de Blasio's wife is  Of some type of career  Or just buy a Blasio  The guy has nothing but a PR move  That's inappropriate  I guess she's of Caribbean descent  Look at that afro he's got  Wow  It's fucking awesome  I like that one, huh?  He's rocking the afro  He's killing it  It's great  Hey, hey, hey  Fucking Heywood Nelson  Enough already  You gotta think he hates that his son has the huge afro 
[01:21:30]  Right?  I don't know  When you're a candidate in New York  And you're a Democrat  Your son  Has a huge afro  He's brown and has a giant afro  Absolutely  That's really gonna help you, right?  This guy  You think he told his son  Hey, man  Don't you cut that shit  Here's a couple thousand  He's a big, huge afro  I'm gonna need it for the campaign  You know what?  You're right  He's such a liberal  Like, he is really hardcore liberal  Yeah, because his son is going everywhere he goes  And it's great, too  Because he puts his son in all the commercials  And you think it's just some black kid talking about Bill de Blasio 
[01:22:00]  And he's like, by the way  Bill's my dad  My dad  My dad  Which, by the way, that is right there  Hey  Like, look what that is  He's in race  Like, if it's such a thing that shouldn't be noticed or thought about  Why would that be a reveal?  Yeah  Why would that be  And that's like having a short kid and then going, hey, by the way  Why would you say, by the way, if it's a non-issue?  Because he sets himself up in, like, this perfect position  Where if anybody confronted him on that, he'd go, whoa  I'm just saying, it's my son 
[01:22:30]  But that's a  But why by the way?  That's a big face to everyone, by the way  He's my dad  Oh, shit  Oh, shit  Yeah, and you're like, oh, fuck  It's so obvious to me that we're going to have a really shitty mayor  Oh, God  Jesus Christ  Someone's got to say that, too  Yeah  These candidates all suck  We're going to have a shitty mayor  And then we hated the Bloomberg  We're going to wish Bloomberg stayed around  I like him more in hindsight now  I really do  I'm starting to wish I didn't hate him so much 
[01:23:00]  Stop and Frisk has become a huge issue in New York City  And, you know, racial profiling in general  Yeah  You know, let's pretend that, you know, we don't notice  That's okay  How did Bobo call in with a topic that we're actually doing?  I know  Bobo  Wow  Bobo  Well, I've been seeing these ads all over the fucking place  All right  He sees the ads  I thought I'd make you guys aware of it  How annoying it is  And it feels like we're screwed 
[01:23:30]  Rubberwoods that election  Thank you  We'd like to make you aware of something that's annoying  It's called your voice  Thanks, Bobo  Thank you, Bobo  You're terrific  I can't wait to hear your talk show  Bill de Blasio  There's a commercial that's worse  That scares the shit out of me  Which one's that?  The cop guy  Got it?  With his mustache?  Yeah, yeah  Got it  Is he gonna kill him?  Yeah  Is that a hit?  Is he basically telling the world that he's gonna kill this guy?  Do you remember who it's for?  And why is he making fun of mall cops?  Yeah, yeah  He's trashing mall cops 
[01:24:00]  But where the mustache goes up a little bit and goes  Got it?  He goes, I'm no mall cop  Got it  Got it  Holy fuck is that scaring me  He would throw down with that guy  He'd fucking kick his ass  What is that about?  What campaign?  I don't even know what campaign that's for  Is that for the  I think that's for mayor also  That's for mayor also?  Yeah  You got that commercial for the rest of the country?  Because I'm sure they haven't  Yeah, I'm a  Heard of this one yet  I'll find it  I got the names now  It just seems like New York is  Is a little doomed with some of these candidates  Right  Like they're talking about some real 
[01:24:30]  But this  Progressive things that'll  But this old school cop I think  Is gonna fucking kill a guy or something  Yeah, this guy  Yeah, look at him  This commercial's been scaring the shit out of me  But then I'm like  Why is he making fun of mall cops?  To make his point  Because mall cops aren't gonna say shit to him  Because somebody  Whoever the candidate is  Equated the NYPD to mall cops  Right  So he's saying  You know, we're not mall cops  But by saying we're not mall cops  Now you're making fun of those guys  But you can make fun of mall cops 
[01:25:00]  No one gives a shit  You're kinda right  Mall cops and bridge and tunnel fucking cops  Is he a Republican, this guy?  I would assume  The Democrats, we've had fucking  How many years now?  Almost many, many years of good prosperity in New York  It's been all Republican mayors  Do you wanna  Even though Bloomberg is technically a liberal Republican  You wanna go right back to a liberal  That's a dumb move  But he's fiscally conservative  Yeah  For the most part, Bloomberg  And he did some unpopular shit  Yeah, yeah  But these people 
[01:25:30]  You know, when you see  He's gonna tax the wealthy  To bring back after-school programs  And it's like  Oh boy  Oh boy  Back to Koch  Yeah, yeah  The good old days  I would love to see Times Square  Just decimated  I would too  Back to its old porn theaters  And crime  Just to go  See?  Just for an I told you so  Ruined people's lives  So I could go  I told you so  Yeah  Yeah  Can we hear the commercial?  Oh, let me hear this 
[01:26:00]  For 36 years  I was a Port Authority cop  Oh  This guy's a badass  Doesn't even fucking  Two different colored mustaches  This guy's a badass  Yeah  Including 37 men and women  Who died on 9-11  Oh, what happened there?  Including 37 men and women  Who died on 9-11  I was in Tower Number 1  So when a bureaucrat like Joe Loder  Calls me a mall cop  He offends every police officer  Mr. Loder 
[01:26:30]  I'm no mall cop  Got it?  Oh, man  That sneer  He goes  Got it?  You haven't seen this one yet?  That lip goes up  He goes  Got it?  I'm like  Oh, fuck  How many fucking wood shampoos  Has that guy dealt out  In his career?  Holy shit  I think Joe Loder's in trouble  Yeah  Holy fuck  Joe Loder's gonna get his ass  Handed to him  Yeah  This isn't gonna end  After the campaign's over  I don't think  Joe Loder's shit to me  Got it?  That slight sneer he does 
[01:27:00]  With his lip  Oh, fuck  Yeah  Joe Loder's a real cunt hair  He is  Got it  You wanna make fun of his  Two-color mustache  When the commercial first comes on  Not anymore, though  But then once you hear him talking  You're like  Yeah  I'm tapping out  I ain't fucking with that guy  I kinda like that guy  Bleach half my mustache  Joe Loder can go eat fudge  Excuse my language  Yeah, but the commercials  All I'm seeing are  For the most part  Very, very liberal  Minded mayoral candidates  And boy  That Anthony Weiner 
[01:27:30]  Just keeps trying  He was at the  Caribbean day  You got it?  I got it  Fuck, that guy  Will not stop  He is relentless  I fucking love him  Yeah  I just love this guy now  I'm not leaving  Fuck you  If you wanna  I know Jim loves  When people try the accents  Because of where their surroundings are  Oh, yeah  Oh, yeah  Don't tell me  He further humiliates himself  He sounds a bit Jamaican  In this clip  A little bit  A little bit  If you felt the need  To call out E-Rock 
[01:28:00]  On saying style  Style  Wait till you hear  Mayoral candidate Weiner  At the parade  Wait a blast  That's him  Wait, what?  That was him  What did he say?  I'll tell you why 
[01:28:30]  That doesn't hurt as much  Because he's doing it on purpose  He's not doing it accidentally  Like Hillary did  Oh, it's having fun  Yeah, it's having fun  It's having a little fun  We come too far  That was a sickening  Because she didn't know  She was doing it  Oh, that was great  Yeah  Oh, Anthony Weiner's just like  Let's have a little fun  Yeah  Yeah, he's just doing the accent  Javi Kahn  My bad loss  I love him  Yeah  Love the Weiner  He's gotta win  He won't leave 
[01:29:00]  And he's got people  In his ads  I love him  You know, and they're like  You know, it's all about  The middle class  It ain't about his personal life  They always gotta address  Like, look  We know this guy's  A degenerate scumbag  And I love how these guys  Solve all our problems  In a campaign ad  It rocks  Yeah, yeah  All I have to do  Is fucking vote for this guy  And everything's perfect  Everything's great again  His personal life  Is the only reason  I'd vote for him  Like, I don't like his  I think he's too liberal for me  Yeah, he is definitely  You know  Definitely  His personal life 
[01:29:30]  I relate to  Who's making a big comeback  In the polls  I don't know  Someone shot up there  If I knew the guys  De Blasio?  I think it might have been him  He might have shot  I think De Blasio's ahead  Isn't he?  Yeah, he came out of nowhere  They're saying  That, uh  Had a big fucking  That son of his  Doing the commercials  I guess is working  Pretty well  Yeah, yeah, yeah  De Blasio is on the verge  Of avoiding a democratic runoff  Which is to say it's him  Yeah  That big ass afro  Did him a world of good 
[01:30:00]  Yes  Damn it  We should grow afros  You got me  I'll be in your campaign ads  With you  I've kind of been there already  So  Yeah, but we should  We should bring back the afros  Bring back the afros  They're back  I brought it back already  Yeah, but you're  Better than ever  You're barely on the show  Yeah  Very much a side thought  At the end of the day  Can we take a break  And get into  Jimmy's  Greatest week ever  It's not even that big  Of a deal to most people  Just to me  It was good  Yeah  Alright  Can we clear the field  And make sure we talk about this  Right after the break

[01:36:00]  And every single story  Is some racial conflagration  Well yeah  And as you know  My book Mugged  Just came out in paperback  Paperback  Or maybe you don't know  Since no one will ask me about it  Um  Because of Syria  And no  It's a disaster  Whenever Democrats  Are running foreign policy  It's just one bad thing  After another  They can't take  National security seriously  And you know  Even the New York Times  Is saying  Obama tries to lure  Uh  Congress  Into box  He made him  For himself  Yeah  It really is odd 
[01:36:30]  He came out  Full of  As they say  Piss and vinegar  At the beginning  The uh  The red line  Of course  Had been crossed  No one really knew  What that was  But uh  He said  Don't cross it  Yeah  Apparently it gets crossed  And now  It's  It's  One of the worst things  You could possibly do  Is put yourself  In a corner like that  Yep  Where you say  Well if you do this  We're gonna have to do something  Because now you have to do something  Right  Or you look weak  And indecisive  Well he does look weak  Whatever he does  He's gonna look weak  And it looks like he's looking for some bombing target 
[01:37:00]  That will harm nothing  Right  I have no effects  Right  I mean he can't hit the chemical weapons plants  Or he could be responsible for spritical weapons  If he does some real damage to Syria  They could retaliate  Uh huh  And then what's he gonna do  Yeah  Yeah  And also you gotta worry about Israel  Being right there in the middle of the mix  That could be part of the retaliation  Part of the retaliation  But at least we don't have to worry about Iraq being in the middle of the mix  Right  Sure  Seriously I mean can you imagine in the middle of everything else going on 
[01:37:30]  If you had that lunatic Saddam Hussein  Who by the way used chemical weapons to kill more than ten times as many people as Assad has  But suddenly liberals  I don't know if you watch MSNBC  Oh they're all so self-righteous and on their high horses  Because we are a country that does not stand for this  Hey where are you guys on Iraq?  Because he killed 5,000 Kurds in a single day with chemical weapons  It really is amazing when you look at how they have been judging George W. the whole time  Uh with Iraq 
[01:38:00]  And what you see here is a president that was just gonna plow right in there without any congressional approval  With really no one  Oh I don't think he needs it  No no he doesn't need it  No he's going there because he wants to lure them  He wants to lure them  And no alliance whatsoever  Not even Britain  Not even England  I'm actually happy that they said no  I don't care how many people they gas  That whole population hates our guts  Syria hates us 
[01:38:30]  I don't care what goes on in that nation  It has nothing to do with me  Mind our fucking business  And stop trying to run the world  And that includes Iraq and Afghanistan  Fuck them  I don't care what they do  Stop  Well I admit that there is a certain irritation to going in and building democracy at the cost of great American sacrifice  And then having them be ungrateful jerks about it  But Rumsfeld and Cheney will give up on Iraq before I do 
[01:39:00]  I think that was a magnificent war  Obama is trying to destroy it  It's the one place we have democracy  It's an Arab Israel  We had a million  We didn't have a million  But we literally had ten reasons to take out Saddam  He had tried to assassinate a former president of the United States  There were 20 UN resolutions against him  We did find chemicals of mass destruction  We didn't find stockpiles  You know why?  He had moved them to Syria  That is kind of ironic these days 
[01:39:30]  It's like oh wow okay  That's where they went  That's where these came from  Remember there was an Iraqi general  He had worked for Saddam Hussein  George's Sada  Remember that?  I have his book  And he did the TV rounds  He was a Christian  Iraqi  And he was on America's side from the beginning  Because Saddam was a lunatic  And he said  And he had been a general  He said oh we were going gangbusters  I mean obviously we were using weapons of mass destruction  We had them 
[01:40:00]  We were developing nukes  And he wrote a book  And went on TV  Saying we put them on trucks  And moved them to Syria  We kind of knew that was happening too  I think at the time  We kind of knew that they were being shipped over to Syria  And there was just nothing we could do about it  What's the time table on this whole thing now?  I mean the element of surprise  Oh my god  I think that's missing  Oh my god  Just do it  If you can do it  Just do it  It really is  I couldn't give everyone time to make vacation plans 
[01:40:30]  Astounding  Holy fuck  This Obama's making Clinton look like George Washington  Yeah yeah yeah  But what is the timetable now?  I mean we have to wait for Congress  As soon as he can blame it on Congress  Yeah  Unbelievable  They're making the case  They're going to make their case  I couldn't get past John Kerry's face  What do you think is going on there?  Yeah yeah something's going on  It's really creepy  He was sucking up to the Assads  Not five minutes ago  That picture went around  This last couple days  I've been having dinner with Assad 
[01:41:00]  Yeah  And now  What was that?  It was fairly recently  It was  It was right before he became  Secretary of State  Right  But not only that  I tweeted out last week  Which I vaguely remembered  It was only last year  January 12th  Vogue ran  A fawning profile of the Assads  A rose in the desert  Yeah  A rose in the desert  No I understand  And I think it's kind of  Silly of liberals to complain  Remember that photo of Rumsfeld 
[01:41:30]  I think it was Rumsfeld  Shaking Saddam  Say on 20 years ago  Yeah because most of the time  We're not at war  We don't want to be at war  If we're not at war with the country  Yes we try to have  Decent diplomatic relations  Right  That is different from  Sucking up to them  And having fawning  Vogue profiles  And just the irony  Of watching Kerry  The Secretary of State  Pleading this case  For his boss  Like that  It's just  It rings a little familiar  Of what we saw  The liberals  Going crazy about  Do you think Obama wants  To attack him now  Or he's almost hoping 
[01:42:00]  Congress says no  And takes the embarrassment  Of him  Because once Britain said no  We just look like  Kind of dickheads  Going over there  Maybe he wants them  To say no  I think he'll still  Fire missiles  Like Anne said  Into like the side  Of a mountain  Even if they say no  Just so he's like  Look I'm resolute  I do this  You know  I honestly think  He'll still do it  I hope Congress says no  I don't know  What John McCain  And Lindsey Graham  Are thinking  What they need  To vote on  Is  Could we have a vote 
[01:42:30]  On that ultimatum  You gave  Can we vote  On a time machine  To go back  And have you not  Issue an ultimatum  Right right  Yeah no ultimate  What president  Pits himself  In that situation  Reagan would have  But then acted on it  Without you know  That Reagan would have  And then acted on it  Yeah if you're gonna do it  Act on it  And just shut your face  Don't get  I don't think Reagan  Would have  Because you don't  Want to give them warning  Right  This guy's doing so much  Like you say  How long are we gonna  Talk about this  Yeah  This guy can move 
[01:43:00]  Anything  Anywhere he wants  At this point  It's really unbelievable  So any attack  Would be useless anyway  It's just not our problem  I mean if it's  Coming to Israel  Israel can handle it  They can handle  The entire Middle East  They don't need our help  I'm tired of running over there  And trying to fucking  Clean that shithole  Of the fucking place up  The entire Middle East  Is a shithole  And it's not my problem  And the picking and choosing  With how we get so high  And mighty  That we're saving the children  Yeah  Is ridiculous  Why is that any more important  Than the millions of other children 
[01:43:30]  That are dying on a daily basis  For whatever other warlord  Or this one  Or a corrupt government  Where are we in the Sudan  Where are we in  Rwanda  Yeah Rwanda  Or Somalia  Right right  Nothing  Well that's why  These humanitarian interventions  And that's always the excuse  Democrats use  They never want to say  We're doing this to help America  And in fact  In Bosnia  Remember Clinton  Did those bombings  Yeah yeah  Madeleine Albright  And I think Secretary of Defense Cohen 
[01:44:00]  They both publicly bragged about the fact  And Clinton  We have no territorial objective  We have no interest in  This is purely humanitarian  Well then don't do it  Because these are American soldiers  Who have volunteered  To defend America  Not to go around  Doing humanitarian missions  Also you can choose wrong  Yeah  Yeah  The whole pick and choose  And what gets priority  Over something else  I don't  I have never seen a pattern  Does it make us safer  Yeah  But what does it make us safer 
[01:44:30]  What does this have to do  With Ann Coulter's book  I know  Mugged  Well that's just it  That is a good point  You know we could talk about  This Syria crap all day  But obviously  There's a book to be sold here  When the Trayvon Martin trial  Was going  Oh it was the Trayvon Martin trial  The George Zimmerman trial  Was going on  It was a perfect example  Of a lot of the stuff  You cite in Mugged  Yes  Yes  It's we went back  To the racial demagoguery  Of well you guys  Are from around here  Right  Remember New York 
[01:45:00]  Oh yeah  60  Not so much 60s  70s  80s  Right up until  I remember the 60s  Right up until  Really I  I mean the argument  Of my book is  Right up until  The OJ verdict  And then  White America  Just said  Screw it  We're done  The White Guilt Bank  Is shut down  And we had peace  You could finally  Publicly discuss  The shockingly high crime rates  Among young black males  And it wasn't helping  Denying it  What's funny about 
[01:45:30]  The Trayvon Martin case  Is this  This campaign  To persuade America  That  That black Americans  Are being menaced  By white men  Across the country  Oh come on  Even blacks  Don't think that  You would be  You would be hard pressed  To find  A handful  Of those stories  Right  On a  Weekly basis  Then meanwhile  The black on black crime  That that's going on  Is astounding  And the black on white crime  Yes  That is  Unbelievably swept 
[01:46:00]  Under whatever carpets  Mainstream media could find  Yes  Is rarely acknowledged  What is the  Because it drives me crazy too  And it's like  What is  This sickening mindset  Like no one is sitting down  Going  Let's edit  This for  They never have that discussion  How do they all agree on it  Like I don't know  What's happening mentally  Is it a guilt thing  Or is it the fact  That certain people  Can't accept the fact  That there are blacks  That just don't like them  So they try to  I don't understand  What they're trying to do  I don't understand  What the mentality is 
[01:46:30]  Well it's not guilt  That's the only  They always claim  This is white guilt  Right  That's just part of  Their deep feeling  Well no  Because they're never  Apologizing for anything  They did  I always say  It's not a  It's not a mega cult  But it's a they  A culpa  It's not I'm racist  It's your racist  Everybody else is racist  But here I'm a pure  White liberal  Well maybe the guilt  They feel is the guilt  Over their own privilege  Like maybe they feel  Like an uglier guilt  Which is I'm white  Therefore I know more  And I'm better  And I feel almost  Guilty about that 
[01:47:00]  It's not even a guilt  Of I've done something wrong  But the guilt of  I am  And I am so powerful  I think you have to  Get away from the guilt  It's bragging  It's arrogance  They feel  They think they are  Absolutely perfect  And they have  No black friends  They arrange their lives  To live in neighborhoods  Where they will never  Encounter a black person  They have no black viewers  For their shows  And their names are  Anthony Cumia  Yeah but you  If I could just say 
[01:47:30]  A that's not true  But B  You don't go around  Claiming you know  Attacking other white people  As if you are the spokesman  For black America  Who can  I don't think  You know you have  An obligation to be friends  With someone of a different race  For the good of society  But liberals do  And then they're living  In glass houses  But this phoniness  That they have  Has done nothing but harm  The black community  It's made them  Completely dependent  On the government  Yes  And there's this lack of 
[01:48:00]  I was talking  I forgot who I was talking to  A lack of something  Called shame  To be shamed  At something  Is  It's an incentive  To not do that thing  Right  There's this acceptance  Of this horrid behavior  That just  If you just turn around  And said  No people don't  Fuck act like that  Perhaps it might get through  To one or two people  Or instead of just  Apologizing for the  For the way people act  And have leaders  Talk about  Other issues 
[01:48:30]  Like how  This white on black  Holocaust of crime  That's going on apparently  You know  Maybe that would do something  But until somebody  Does something  Right  Different than just  You know  Jesse and Al  And all the rest  And dumb white people  No it was actually  A beautiful period  Right after  For about a decade  A little more than a decade  After the OJ verdict  Because blacks  Were suddenly being  Treated like adults  They weren't coddled  People didn't walk  On eggshells  You were a lot less worried  I mean you probably  Felt this a lot  Jim  I think people 
[01:49:00]  Who talk publicly  You weren't terrified  That you could mention  That blacks commit  More crimes  Than whites  And lose your career  It was more sexual content  Years ago  Like the FCC  Was going to get down  On you for dropping  An F-bomb  Or you're sexually  You're pandering  To this or that  And then it turned  To where you know  Hey nappy headed hole  Hell  Hey  And he's fucking fired  And it just  It got really  Strange and dangerous 
[01:49:30]  To even  Open your mouth  Obama brought it all back  And it wasn't  It was a little bit  Him intentionally  But it was mostly  The left  Supporting him  And the media  Because  And you see it now  How they use  The issue of race  To defend  Every single thing  He does  Everything  Comes down to  If you watch MSNBC  And they're explaining  Anything Obama does  And it has this  Negative air to it  It is absolutely  Because he's black  And white people  Hate him  Yeah  That's every answer  They've come up with 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  Amazing  The Tea Party  They never found  Any racism  From the Tea Party  No  Where were all those  Protests where people  Were spitting on  Black people  And it never  Materialized  That was a shocking  One  I mean they had  Written the press  Releases on that  Before  That was the  Protest against  Obamacare  And I don't think  Incidentally that  John Lewis ever  Made the claim  Himself that he  Was called the  N-word  Right  He allowed others  To say it  He didn't deny it  Well once it gets  Out there  And we saw what  Happened with the 
[01:50:30]  Zimmerman trial  Once bad intel  Gets out there  In the public  They don't care  What the real facts  Are  Right  I mean you know  If you  And to this day  If you discuss  The Zimmerman trial  With people  They will insist  That a young black man  Was trying to walk home  And was shot in cold blood  They leave out the parts  About you know  Zimmerman being punched  In the face  Yeah but Zimmerman was  Told to stand down  By an authority figure  And he did not  By a general  From the army  He was told  To stand down  Do not leave your vehicle 
[01:51:00]  Because that apparently  Is illegal  It's like  I always  And I always mention  I was like  The first illegal thing  That happened  In that entire evening  Was Zimmerman getting  Punched in the face  Right  That's it  Anything up till then  Don't even talk about it  Right  And I  I  Mentioned this in a column  There was a  It's hard to come up  With the reverse facts  Because you should not have  White people  Besieging blacks in America  Despite what they say  On MSNBC  But there was a case 
[01:51:30]  About 10 years ago  In New York  Of a black homeowner  And some  A group of white thugs  Came to the end  Of the driveway  And were you know  Yelling and carrying on  Menacing his son  I think  That's right  With his son  Yeah in the driveway  And every  I mean they never  He never had to  Leave his home  Call the cops  And his son  Knew who the kids were  They could have  Tired themselves out  Gone home  And then the police  Could have visited  The next day  And the father went out  And gets in a fight  With him  And he shoots  And kills one of the kids  And I remember at the time  And you can still  See it online  People were on 
[01:52:00]  The homeowner's side  And he was black  And the kid he shot  Was white  You know  If you're going to go up  And punch someone  Or harass someone  I'm sorry  You may get  I'm sorry  But you may get  You may get killed  There's never any  There's no sense  With the double standard  You know  I don't think  There ever will be  We're just  Today  There's a story  In the news  About a one year old  That got shot  His father  I guess  25 drug arrests 
[01:52:30]  He's a gangbanger  His father  He's strolling  His one year old  Down the sidewalk  And I guess  They were saying  He must have been  The intended target  But you know  The kid gets shot  In the head  And killed  And you're just  Seeing all this  Outrage  And people  Oh my god  This is a shame  When two black  Young men  Shot a white  Baby in the face  Instantly the mother  Was being blamed  They were saying  It was an insurance thing 
[01:53:00]  This is no way  What happened with that  Was it actually those two  Oh yeah  They were found guilty  It's not on the news anywhere  Where is it  No it's not on the news  Well luckily  We have the internet  So they can't hide it  From us anymore  Where is it  But that double standard  Is amazing  Because I've seen  This story on the news  And they're talking  They need to find  Who did this  There's a reward  No inkling that  This 25 times  He's been arrested  And gone through the system  For drugs and what not 
[01:53:30]  And gun crimes  This father  That he had something  To do with his kid's death  Just by being a gang member  Right  The media is also  The part of this  Was brought on  By white people  People like Susan Smith  Who blame black guys  For killing her kids  And then the media  Went ballistic  Because they never  Check anything  They just run with it  And then they look like  Such absolute assholes  Yeah  That they are so paranoid  About making that mistake again  And looking like  They're racially biased  But you're going to get that  Right  Because you have to come up  With a story that's believable 
[01:54:00]  The lacrosse team  You know  That was a bunch of  Bullshit too  Yeah  Done the other way around  It's  Those things are going to happen  But you can't hold it up  As the rule  Again  The same thing as  The white on black crime  You can't make that  Oh my god  We have to deal  With this problem  No  You want to deal  With a huge problem  Deal with the black  On black violence  That's going on  And crime  Address that  And that's what blacks want  And historically have  They used to take  The NACV would take polls  Back in the 50s and 60s  And even after  A police shooting  A kid 
[01:54:30]  They do a big poll  What's the biggest problem  In your neighborhood  This is in Harlem  In New York  Number one problem  Crime  Bring more police here  Martin Luther King  Was constantly calling  For more police  He said  It's the  It's the pestilence  Of the ghetto neighborhood  It's crime  And people never think  About the poor  Decent  Especially you know  Elderly and mothers  Oh man  Who are living  In these neighborhoods  Beset by criminals  Stop and frisk  Helps them  Yeah  It's not really  To help me  Right  Right  Yeah well that's  A huge issue too  The stop and frisk 
[01:55:00]  I don't know  I've seen some  Of these moral  Candidates  And boy  It's hearkening back  To the good old days  I guess you could call it  The golden era  Of David Dinkins  Yes  Yeah  Just watch the opening credits  To like Taxi  Right  You'll get a good idea  Of what  Grimy  What kind of gritty  People love a good gritty New York  You know  French connection  Yeah yeah  Well we could be seeing  Some grittiness  Coming back  Dirt coming back  Yeah when I'm hearing 
[01:55:30]  You know  He'll take money  From the rich  And give it to  After school programs  It works so well  Bloomberg grew on me  I hated him for years  Because he's such a nudge  And an old lady  And a fucking moomoo  But I'll tell you one thing  Now you look at him  You're like  What is it you don't like  I don't like fat people  I love it  Stop eating fatso  I don't like fat  And they're frisking  To be white people  I'm like  This sneaky cocksucker  I fucking love him 
[01:56:00]  I really  I'm looking back on it  I'm like I shouldn't  Have hated him  As much as I did  I agree  I agree 100%  Because he did stuff  Like when the  You know  We all knew  It was an Islamic guy  Planting a bomb  In fucking Times Square  Right  Maybe it's people  Against health  He did a few  Of these things  That are such  Annoying sound bites  But when you look  At what he did  He really went after  Fucking  He really targeted  Fatty's  And he targeted  A few other people  He didn't give a shit  Well and ferociously  Defend and stop and frisk  Yeah  I love that press conference 
[01:56:30]  Where he came out  And said well  I've looked at the statistics  And actually we're not  We're stopping too many  White and Asians  Yes he said  We're stopping too many  Whites and Asians  Based on the crime stats  Yeah  It didn't jive with the  Yeah  And that is  Honest talking  But if you were to  Come out with a stat  And said like  X amount of blacks  Are being attacked  By white police officers  Maybe you'd be right  But nobody would argue  That statistic is racist  But if you get the other statistic  People say it's racist  Yeah  That's another thing  Bloomberg has been into  Is a strong police force  Yeah  You know 
[01:57:00]  NYPD  It's amazing how many  Other cities you see  Just completely lose control  Over their streets  And even after game celebrations  Get a little crazy  Yeah  Boy the NYPD  Has gotten really good  At shutting down anything  Oh yeah  That even starts  But that could change overnight  And if a Democrat  Exactly  Become mayor  Boy are New Yorkers  Going to remember  The golden era  Yes  The golden era  All you have to do  Is strip the budget  It was a good run  That was really everything  That turns New York around  But the crime rates 
[01:57:30]  Everything  We had under Dinkins  You couldn't go to parks  Commerce  No  Was not possible  That walkway  They just built  You could never do that  In the old days  It would be instantly  Governed with graffiti  Yeah  Yes  That too  You look at the trains  Back in the old days  The good old days  Yeah  And it all did start  With getting that criminal  Element off the street  And getting a stronger  Police force in there  And boy  If that goes away  It just dominoes  Yeah  But maybe it'll help  Joe Loda 
[01:58:00]  I mean I didn't think  There was any shot  For a Republican to win  Because after you've had  A Republican regime  Whether it's at the national level  Or the New York City level  People forget what it was like  And oh let's try a Democrat  What didn't I like about them  I can't remember  They're going to remember fast  But maybe if the end  Of stop and frisk  Brings back some level  Of crime  As it seems to be doing  You probably talked  About this last week  These young thugs  On the street  Are taunting the cops  Saying you can't stop me  And one guy 
[01:58:30]  Was yelling at a cop  Saying ha ha  You can't stop me  Ha ha ha  No stop and frisk  He turns to walk away  And a gun falls out  Of his pants  Dummy  That's brilliant  I tweeted it out yesterday  If you'd like to see the story  We were on vacation last week  Check out that story  I think it was my last tweet  Nice  And Coulter on Twitter right  Yes  And Mugged  Is out in paperback  Yeah so it's cheaper  And easier to carry  To the beach  And on airplanes  Exactly  Did you add any pages 
[01:59:00]  It's great  Like some people do  I added an introduction  Just because it is true  They absolutely refused  The one thing my book  Really accomplished was  Liberals  Even on MSNBC  The official race baiting  Station  Yes  Stopped race baiting  Once the book came out  Because the day it came out  I could say last night  On Hardball  Chris Matthews  Announced that the word  Chicago is racist  Because Romney had just used it  So he knew  You know that I was going  To go through my entire book tour 
[01:59:30]  Watching MSNBC  And reporting what insane thing  They said  So we didn't get any of it  And then you know  Election came  I went home  Book tour is over  And then  The first thing was  Republicans opposed  Susan Rice for  Secretary of State  Because she's black  Does anybody remember  Who Bush's  Secretary of State was?  Yes  Same last name  Yeah  Right  Unbelievable  Yeah  It really  I don't know  What could be done 
[02:00:00]  About it  Is it a cyclical  Thing  Sure  When they're running  Hillary  We'll all be sexist  Oh god  That's right  Yeah  I'm an optimist  I think it's eventually  We really are  I'm telling you  We are paying for a long  Fucking weird racial history  In this country  And now this is just  Where we're at generationally  It's going to take a little  It will balance out  It's going to balance out  But it did balance back  That's what's so frustrating  Yeah yeah  You can look back  Years ago  And maybe language wise 
[02:00:30]  A little bit of balance  Maybe even after OJ  People were like  What the fuck are we doing?  And suddenly  I mean I do not think  Giuliani could have been  As tough on crime  But for the OJ fans  Wow  Because  That it just didn't work anymore  Calling people racist  I don't think O'Reilly  Could have gone after  Jesse Jackson  The way he did  Remember that  I mean it is one of  The greatest things  O'Reilly has done  Demanding he come on the program  Talking about his finances  And suddenly poof  Jesse Jackson  Was no longer the pope  Of the Democrats  You used to have to go 
[02:01:00]  Kiss his ring  So now you have  Sharpton with a show  On MSNBC  We're regressing  Right  Even though Fox  Palling with the president  Yeah  It's amazing  Fox didn't go after  Sharp  Like after Jesse  Like they should have either  When he dropped that N-bomb  Right  He mumbled nigger  And he mumbled it  And everyone heard it  And they played it  But they didn't kill him for it  Like they would  Even Fox  Well that's because  He was talking about Obama  Exactly  I wouldn't really attack him  For that  That was a fair point 
[02:01:30]  But isn't it fun  Like you know  Nobody  Nobody wants to touch it  When it's  You know  Yeah yeah yeah  Fox could have really  Maybe that was the  Thing they kind of held back  I don't know why  People just forget things too  You're right  Thank you  They forget the fact  That Reverend Al Sharpton  Was this  Just  Local level  Shill  Thug  Yes  Pretty much a thug  I watched that 
[02:02:00]  I watched that documentary  On Morton Downey Jr  That's on  It's hilarious  Oh  Oh is that great  Really  And Reverend Al  Is shown prominently  In that  Just being kicked off  His chair  Rolling around  On the stage  Wasn't that Roy Innes  That attacked him  Yeah yeah  It's like this guy  Has the president's ear now  Well he is  All over my book  I'd forgotten  Because I go through  All of the famous  Racial conflagrations  Greek homos  The 70s and 80s  And I'd forgotten  Everything he was involved in 
[02:02:30]  I mean not only  Tawana Brawley  Crown Heights  Freddie's fashion march  Howard Beach  And then after  The Central Park rape  He brought Tawana Brawley  To the trial  Of the Central Park  Rapists  To announce  To an angry black crowd  That was screaming  And taunting  The poor woman  Who had been raped  And nearly killed  And announcing to the press  I want to see  What justice is like  For a white girl  Who's been  Who's been raped  Oh my god  A grand jury  Looked at this  For eight months

[02:09:30]  I mean there were  Direct quotes  From people working  For the crowd  Sourcing company  And if there's a crowd  Around Anthony Weiner  Where else are they  Coming from  I'd show up  Yeah well Jim  I'd stand around them  Fucking just swap  Cell phone shots  Look at the angle  I got on this one Tony  Wow I didn't know  You could do that  Yeah  I want to hire a crowd  To follow me  And cheer  We should do that  Yay for us  We need supporters  Yeah  Yeah  But some ridiculous cause  Yeah  Like I'm saying  Mandatory workplace erections

Yeah  I mean it was just  It was Bill, Geezer, Tony  I mean  Bill  It wasn't Bill  It was Ozzy, Geezer, and Tony  Right  And you know  They had a ball  We had a few big laughs  Oh  And it was great  And I was  I went to the show  The next night  And they had asked me  If I wanted to go  With  I was gonna get a ride  With fucking  With Tommy  The drummer 
[02:12:00]  And the fucking  Keyboard player  Adam  They take a van  And I was  I was supposed to go  To the concert with them  And I was like  Fuck  I'm gonna go with  A couple guys from the band  Oh man  And Sharon's like  We'll get you a car  If you wanna bring somebody  Or you can just go with  With Tommy and Adam  And I'm like  Fuck bringing somebody  I'll go with Tommy and Adam  Of course  But I didn't mind  I've gone with them  Cause I got  Two days before  They called  And they're like  Would Jim wanna go  With Ozzy to the show  Oh  And I said  Yeah  Jim would wanna go 
[02:12:30]  With Ozzy  To the show  So fucking  The day after  I interview Black Sabbath  I get picked up  And taken to Ozzy's house  And I get to fucking go  To the Sabbath show  With Ozzy  In his fucking car  We took an hour ride together  In his car  It was  He wasn't driving  No no  It was an SUV  And it was  His driver  And his assistant  Were in the front  And then you know  Me and the Oz man  In the two middle seats 
[02:13:00]  And behind us  Was another one  Of his assistants  And this guy  Billy Morrison  Who's you know  He was in the cult  And he's  You know  They're very close friends  And we just chatted  Wow  And it was remarkably  Did he have him laughing  On the way to his show  Yeah more on the way home  On the way to the show  We talked about  It was about an hour ride  To Irvine  And Florentine was telling  Jonathan  It's the only time  Jim ever prayed  For traffic  And we talked  About 20  He started yapping 
[02:13:30]  About movies  And then  He listens to music  I guess to get ready  Like  They know  They're all  You know how it is  Before show  You don't want to  Be fucking bothered  So I guess like  25 minutes into the ride  He puts his headphones on  And just chills  And listens to  I think stuff  He's going to sing  That night  And other stuff  And whatever  Did he go  Yeah  Huh  Ozzy I'm trying to do  This thing  Yeah  Yeah  But I stayed away  From him before the show  You know  I avoid  Wait you get to the venue  We get to the venue 
[02:14:00]  Probably  You got to slow  This whole story down  We get to the venue  So now he's  Hold on  Alright  So you talk for 20 minutes  And then he puts his headphones on  To get in the zone  For the show  You're still driving  Now you arrive at the venue  Yes  And I had asked them  The day before too  Like how long do you guys  Need before a show  You don't like to be bothered  And Ozzy immediately  Goes one hour  I don't want to talk to anybody  One hour before the show  At least  And then  You know  I think either  I think he's just  24 hours  Like he just  These guys  Want to be left  The fuck alone  No shit  So I watched  Actually Tony do his warm up 
[02:14:30]  Which I had never been on stage  Watching the warm up  And we just said a brief hello  And I kind of  I know to step aside  Like I just don't want to be  That annoying guy  Yeah  And I'm just kind of  Hanging out backstage  Looking for shit to do  Like I don't know  What I'm supposed to do  I don't want to bother Ozzy  He's in his dressing room  And I've heard he does  Like vocal warm ups  And that's what these guys do  These singers  It's fucking  It's a nightmare for these guys  They gotta do two hours  Of vocal shit  Before they sing  So I'm walking around  Like literally  I went out and bought merchandise  I don't know what to do  I'm buying shirts  And I just kind of hung out 
[02:15:00]  And ate at craft services  And fucking  You know the artist  Who I met  Who was really cool  Fucking  Shepard Ferry  The guy who did the  He's the  The guy who does  All those obey things  Oh right  And he did Obama's  Fucking hope sign  Of course  He was there  He's a big Sabbath fan  So I chatted with him  Wow  That's pretty impressive  Yeah yeah  He designed their crew shirts  Like their fucking  Backstage crew shirts  So I got a fucking  Crew  You know  I remember the crew  I remember the crew  One of the crew 
[02:15:30]  Hi guys  I remember the crew  Hi guys  Me  Don't forget me  I'm on the team  Hi  And I watched the show  And it was fucking  Where did you watch the show from?  I actually  I only stood backstage  And I don't want to watch  From backstage  Because you know  The sound quality  Is not as good  But I wanted to see them  Enter the stage  From the back  And it was just  Weird to see them  In that zone  Going on  And just sitting there  Watching them  Behind the curtain  Was really  For me  It was a  Of course  Thrill  And I didn't 
[02:16:00]  Ozzy and Tony  Walked on  And I just saw  Geezer  And just said hello  Brief  I could tell  He was in that  You know  He actually stopped  And went  Oh hi  It's Jim  And he just kind of  Like patted my shoulder  Lovingly  It was really weird  And then he went on  And fucking played  Warpigs  Wow  Yeah it was amazing man  It was fucking cool  To see it from backstage  And for me  It was a thrill  And then I just went out  And watched it  From the fucking  First  And the people  I watched it from behind  Were all the  Because I had like  An all access badge  And normally you're not  All allowed to stand  Anywhere with those 
[02:16:30]  But they're nicer  Out in California  Than they are  Like in Jersey  They would have been  Such dicks  Can't stand here  Can't stand here  But nobody bothered me  Because I had the badge  They were all just  Even when they moved  Fans along  Who were kind of  Standing and just  Watching from  Like you know  It's where the  Wheelchair people sit  I was staying behind them  So I had a great view  But they weren't  The security people  They weren't yelling  At people  They were just  Moving people along  But they were being  Really nice  Like they weren't  Being jerk offs  Like they can be here  And then after the show  I went back  And I was fucking 
[02:17:00]  He hustled  Right out of there  So I just  You know  We all ran to the car  I was a part of the group  That runs to the car  Oh  Pushing fans out of the way  There were really no fans  Back there  But even  You know  It was just  There was three fucking  SUVs ready to go  And his was the lead one  So of course  I'm following  Ozzy back to his car  Which I would have done anyway  But now I was allowed  To get in it  And he jumps in  And the guys jump in the back  And they're ready to go  But I'm stuck outside  Because I don't know  How to make my seat 
[02:17:30]  Go back  So my seat's folded down  So I'm holding everything up  And I'm like  Put the fucking seat back  Because I'm scared  They're just going to  Close the door  And take off  And ditch you  But we got the seat back  And I jumped in  And the whole  Ozzy got to show you  My pride and joy  Fucking  Snuck in  Rupert Pupkin  Sneaks into the limo  What a great seat  And yeah  And we rolled back  And this time  There was no music  We just yapped  The whole fucking  He was relieved  And relaxed at that point  That's so cool  And fucking eating 
[02:18:00]  And you know  We had a piece of pizza  You know how it is  When fucking  The pizza box gets open  And Ozzy eats pizza  And hands you the box  You gotta have pizza  You saved the box  No I passed it back  I wanted to save it  I wanted to save his crust  Yes of course  You want a banana  I'll share a banana  I'll share that with you  My banana  We could split the banana  It was fucking  Get the banana clip  I love that clip  I love that clip  Jimmy with fucking  Gene Simmons  Gene Simmons and the banana  Offers his banana  But then decides 
[02:18:30]  It'd be way better  If they shared the banana  We just fucking  Thank god  He's a fucking serial killer  We chatted for fucking  Probably 45 minutes  Going back  Yeah  That's awesome  Oh dude  It was fucking  And it wasn't awkward  Or it wasn't like  Interview style  It was really  It was on  Again it was so  Cool an experience  It was so  It could have been  So fucking  Painfully frightening  That it flipped  Click into comfortable  Oh  Like you know how  You're so overwhelmed  By something  That it becomes okay  And it's like  You go way past 
[02:19:00]  Where fear would be  This is actually a dream  You know  Yeah  That probably thousands  Of people have had  And you just lived it  But it was  That's unbelievable  It was fucking  Really fun  Did he get to sleep  Over his house  No  Sleep over  There was no sleep over  Put on your jammies  Jammies  We're going to tell  Ghost stories  And uh  Would you have blown him  Let's get to the  Real question here  No  Let's get to it  On the way home  Great Sabbath show 
[02:19:30]  Everyone's now relaxed  What would you do  If he actually said that  I would have been  Really disappointed  Only because I know  He would have looked at me  Differently the next day  If I did it  Disappointed  Yeah I would have been like  Oh man  Do I gotta  Oh man  This is perfect day  And now Adi has to  Blow me  If I could  Oh no  It ends like  It would have ended  With me  If I was a chick  Like if I was in the car  And a girl got a ride  I would have asked her  To blow me  But it was just  How did the night end though  So now  Do they drop you 
[02:20:00]  Back off at Ozzy's house  You go to Ozzy's first  And then  Did you go inside  For a little nightcap  No no  Nobody went in  He was tired  You guys just kissed  On the front  Stoop  Yeah  He just said  Good night to everybody  You know how it is  You get a little hug  That's awesome  Good seeing you Jim  Oh look at that  Yeah it was really fun  What a fucking great guy man  And I forget what he said  He really made me laugh though  It was fucking  Yeah  We've said it  I mean he's been in here  What five or six times now  He is hilariously funny  He really is funny man  And it was just a great 
[02:20:30]  Great  Fucking  Like you can't  Have  But I didn't feel like  A contest winner fanboy  Yeah yeah yeah  Like it seemed almost like  You know a contest winner  Like thing  Like you get so lucky  To go to the show  But it was  Does he seem lonely  Just because he's so famous  Like it sounds like  There wasn't a lot of  Like people around  No  Except for people doing their job  The people around him  Are people  He's not  I wouldn't say he's lonely  He's got so many people  That want to be around him 
[02:21:00]  And like I noticed that  Yeah but that could be  That could be lonely  Because those people  You know  Are they truly  You know friends or  Well the people that he has  That he selects to be around him  Before a show  Are people he's close to  Like the guys John  And Dave  And Billy's a friend  They're all  They're not just handlers  They're like people  He's really close to  It's like  It's like literally like  Having three or four  Of your closer friends  Around you  And then you know  With all the people  That work for him  Have worked for him  For years  So I felt like  I was almost  An interloper 
[02:21:30]  Like I was with these people  That have this very  Intimate relationship  And they were all great  And it was  It was comfortable  But that's  Yeah yeah  I almost didn't want  To be a fucking outsider  But you know  Again it was just a fun  Hang and ride  And I was so glad  I could talk about movies  And I didn't talk about  The fucking album  Or you know  What kind of houses  You have  Big  It's funny  I didn't see  This is why I love Sharon  Because it was done  In  You saw the picture  I twittered  It was me  No  I was sort of

[02:22:30]  I can't even  No you'd be  We're just a bunch of  No you're right to say that  No we're not though  Because I  I wanted to be the guy  But I figured I'd let  Someone else say  No you're not Jimmy  You're not going bald  Maybe not  But on this photo  I think it was  Before that Sam  I think you  You twittered  The Tonight Show  I think it was  Before then  It actually was  Before then  I got  You  Wow that's a great  Suit you got on  With John McCain  Oh yeah  That's the one  I went to Barney's  For  Holy fuck  Is that a nice suit

[02:23:30]  Yeah it was  It was a great  Fucking 45 minute  Almost an hour  We talked  It was just  It was comfortable  I just realized  I'm behind on your  Twitter a little bit  There's a dead guy  Doing 75 miles per hour  Oh yeah  A guy out of the airport  It was fucking creepy  That's  He's going 75 miles  An hour right there  Oh yeah  Yeah  Holy shit  Go to Jim Norton  On Twitter  Hmm  Yeah I wish  That was a little clearer  Because I would love  To blow that up  And hang it on my wall  That's a great  Fucking photo  That's pretty clear  What are you talking about  Maybe I'll do a screen grab  From uh  Tell him to give you

No no no  This is from like 1967  There's a famous photo shoot  He did  Ollie did  Yeah yeah yeah  For Life magazine I think

[02:26:30]  And they were all nervous  Because it was her  And she goes  What the fuck  Are you doing  And they're like  Oh  She goes  No I'm serious  What the fuck  Are you doing  I was so glad  To not be on the  Receiving end  Of that  She was fucking  Fuming  Because these guys  Just are moving  These fucking  These really expensive  Oh shit  Crews come into your house  And they don't realize  That you actually live there  Yeah yeah  And they're doing shit  Like without proper care  Like they just  Because the whole room  Was in disarray 
[02:27:00]  And she's well beyond  The point of having to  Like  Be nice  But she was  But she was actually right though  Because the way  They had moved shit around  You're like  Oh my god  What the fuck  Are you guys doing  Like there's all these  Expensive things  Just piled up in the corner  With wire  It's like you know  I know you gotta  Shoot stuff  But at least  Handle the room  Right  A certain way  You know this is  Somebody's real living space  This isn't a fucking set  But it was really nice  To hear her fucking  Snap off of them  And I was just happy  That I wasn't  On the receiving end  Of Best Boy  You get to see  Yeah  Sharon lay into somebody 
[02:27:30]  Yeah  That's pretty cool  Very pleasing  Yeah  My greatest week  In a long time  I'm watching my manager  Almost destroy his marriage  With fucking Edgar  You know  Let me tell you guys something  When you do April Fool's  Like there's  Moon rocks  On your shoes  What  April Fool's  Oh yeah  That's Edgar  Jonathan did it  In a fucking restaurant  With me  And he does it  So loud  Oh no  Dude it's uncomfortable  People look  People turn around  And look  He does it like this 
[02:28:00]  April Fool's  It's not about the volume  It's  He's a fucking maniac  My manager's a maniac  He's a lunatic  Sam heard him do it  On speakerphone  Jim called me  On speakerphone  But Jonathan didn't know  It was me  But he knew  He was on speakerphone  But he didn't know  We were going to do Edgar  And so  But then Jim  Just kind of coaxed  I forgot exactly  How he did it  But he coaxed him  Into it  I just said something  Like you know  Like  You know 
[02:28:30]  There's a spaceship  On my house  And then Jonathan  Just can't help it  It could have been  Anyone though  On the phone  That's what I'm saying  He knew there was  Somebody on the phone  But it didn't matter  To him  At that moment  That it might not  Be appropriate  The synapse  Just kicked in  And he goes  Approved  But he does it  That loud  And dude  He's fucking  He's a lunatic  He's fucking  Doing it in the restaurant  And we're next to it  At one point  He did it every night  We ate  But one night  We're next to this woman  And obviously  Like her daughter  And I know  They were uncomfortable 
[02:29:00]  Because they thought  That somebody mentally ill  Was sitting next to it  Of course  Because who else  Would say things like that  And he's texting me  And he goes  His wife  He put over his wife's name  And he goes  Edgar one  And his wife's name zero  Because he goes  He had to apologize  To his in-laws  Because apparently  They don't know  Edgar  Why would they  And like  Fucking  They're ordering food  And meatballs came  And you know  And he said to her parents  He goes  Those aren't meatballs 
[02:29:30]  Those are moon rocks  I propose  And they must have  Just been horrified  And he said  That they laughed  Uncomfortably  And his wife  Just has had enough  And he had to apologize  What is wrong with him  This is the same guy  Who  When you started doing  Bill Tetley  Called his wife  And said  Hey  While you were there  He calls his wife  And he goes  Hey my friend  Bill Tetley  Is coming over  On Wednesday  To pick something up  So can you just 
[02:30:00]  Be there for him  And she goes  Okay  And she cancelled  Her shit  Like her yoga class  She had some other thing  And she forgot  He was just joking  Yeah  And then she goes  Your friend didn't show up  And he goes  What friend  What are you talking about  And she goes  Bill Tetley  He goes  I was joking  I forgot about that  And she doesn't understand  The context  He obsesses  With these characters  He really is  Fucking  Completely nuts  Jesus  But it's funny  That he's such  Like  And I realized  I started to feel bad  Like I'm really wrecking his life 
[02:30:30]  But then I realized  No  None of his friends  Are like this  Like all of my friends  Are like this  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Like he's friends  With Les Moonves  And fucking  And you know  Sod who we had  Like Jonathan knows  Really responsible  Mature people  They don't yell things out  Like April Falls  No  April Falls  Like and he could sit  And hold  A brilliant conversation  With anybody  And he knows how to fit  Into these  And really  These  Like he met  Condoleezza Rice 
[02:31:00]  And with  I forget who  It might have been  Sodder  Someone hooked it up  But he had like  A real conversation  With her  Like he can really  Have these chats  Because he's gone  To these amazing places  And he fits in  To all of these  So there's something  About like me  And Florentine  Like we're the only guys  That fucking cut  Gassers in his car  Like it's my favorite  Thing to do  Is to cut a putrid  Gasser in his car  And then just wait  For him to react  Because he really  Gets angry about it  You don't think  Condi Rice did that  Dude none of  None of  Condi cut a big  Fucking nasty one  Well Jim will say that 
[02:31:30]  To him  To any of your other  Friends drop gassers  In the car  And be like no  It's fucking disgusting  And it's like  I realize that we do  Bring something to his life  Like I feel like  I was taken away  From his life  Like  No you're right  But you know what  We're an element  Of fucking shittiness  And weirdness  That you kind of need  Yeah  We're his  We're his dickhead friends  Like you know what I mean  We're the asshole friends  Yeah  We just happen to be  His clients  So I realize  We do bring something  To his life  I love it  How was this special  By the way  I was out of touch  I couldn't  I couldn't watch it  From where I was  Oh it was funny

[02:36:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show  Sirius X  You guys are back from the toilet  Now back to our show  The Opie and Anthony Show  So we're back from vacation  Yeah  And I was just looking at our podcast  We haven't been able to promote the last two I think  No  Just because of our vacation schedule  There's a lot of great podcasts up there 
[02:36:30]  A lot of episodes  We're up to 16 I think  Yeah tomorrow will be 17  So tomorrow we'll have a brand new Opie and Anthony podcast  But I want to remind people that  We didn't promote the one with Joe Rogan and Papa Rock  Where Papa Rock is fiddling with his goddamn guitar the whole fucking time  Fiddling  Incessantly  It's an amazing hour  And then Mondo Topless  We didn't even get to promote that one  Oh man  Right?  Right  That's the old  What's his name there?  Russ Meyer  Russ Meyer 
[02:37:00]  With his big titted broads  Yes the super vixens  Yeah but we had a little twist on that whole thing  Mondo Topless made our ONA podcast  And then the one that came out while we were away last week  Was Roland Leak and the Metallica info  Oh  And our great interview with Quentin Tarantino  From DiGengo  That's a good one  No  No  Oh the original one  From K-Rock when he was inviting me to his movie theater  Yeah he invited me  Yeah now it's out there on the intranet  Yeah he did invite me 
[02:37:30]  But he left without exchanging of the phone numbers  So what I was supposed to wander Hollywood Hills  We never knew  Knocking on doors  Hoping that I would  You know  Find his place  Yeah the one that's on the podcast  Is when Grindhouse came out  Oh that was it  I swear to you  I liked those movies  Me too  I really did  Yeah I thought it was cool  I like all those movies though  It was a bust  But I really liked those two movies  I didn't appreciate the Django all that much  I know  And not because you'd think you know  Nah  I thought it was way too long 
[02:38:00]  I still haven't seen it  With Django?  Yeah  That was good  I thought that was a little too long though  We're talking about our podcast Jim Norton  Because we haven't been here to promote it  We got three  The last three episodes are really really good  And we haven't said a word about them on our radio show  So go and get them  It's Joe Rogan and Popper Rock  Remember Popper Rock fiddling?  We put that on the podcast  He's fucking fiddling fiddle  Will you stop your fiddling?  Fiddling  Holy fuck  I think the Death Squad took care of us  Because the numbers for the Joe Rogan one is very impressive 
[02:38:30]  Yeah  And we didn't even get to promote it  Right  I know the Death Squad is listening  Thank you Death Squad  Yeah they're good fans man  They're the same as our fans  They're just  You know  They're amazing  They're just fucking hardcore psychopaths  Absolutely  So Joe Rogan, Popper Rock  Then you got the Mondo Topless podcast  Holy fuck  Yeah  And then the one that came out last week while we were away  Which is Roland blowing the Metallica info  He did  Big announcement  Who's the Metallica info?  And we don't even have decided 
[02:39:00]  And Quentin Tarantino, yes  We don't have decided what's tomorrow's yet  Well let's do it right here live  Well what are you thinking?  Fuck, I don't know  We don't have any current stuff  Because we were on vacation last week  Sure were  But what's some fun stuff that maybe the folks at home haven't heard?  The Marky stuff?  Do we play the Marky stuff yet?  That's a good idea  Oh was that fucking good  Remember that shit Little Marky?  Oh boy did we go off on that one  What the fucking how about  How about we  I was thinking that we should maybe 
[02:39:30]  I don't know  Dedicate an hour to like Patrice O'Neal  Dedicate an hour to Bob Kelly  Dedicate an hour to Rich Voss  Their greatest moments on our show  That's not a bad idea  Bill Burr just won  You know we spread them out  Right  Who should we start with?  Oh you want to do that tomorrow?  Why not?  Why don't you start with Burr?  He's got a second show on sale  A son of a bitch is blowing up  At the Beacon Theater  For the New York Comedy Festival  So why not start with Burr?  I mean he's doing very well right now  E-Rock can we get that together really fast?  Of course we can  How about this  The boss wants it  Get it done 
[02:40:00]  How about I said yes  It's going to get done  Alright don't yell at me  I'm trying to help  Sal gets upset when you ask E-Rock  Because E-Rock doesn't do anything  I don't like Sal  Oh man  E-Rock knows  I mean I like Sal  But I don't like him  I don't like Sal  He doesn't  No E-Rock knows our archives  Big time  Yeah he does  What Bill Burr bits?  There's a lot  Which ones would you say E-Rock?  You know the archives  I have to look  Oh  Does Sal have any suggestions?  There was a lot of bits  That weren't Bill centric 
[02:40:30]  But he was a part of it  And then made the bit itself  Someone tell him  Thank you Jimmy  You beat me to it  If he says Bill centric again  I'll fucking lock that door  And set it on fire  Like the Happy Land Disco  Do you like that he said it  Like it was one word?  Like Bill centric?  Yes  I hated that  The way he fired that out  Without thinking  I can't describe how much  I hated that  Why does he get so much abuse?  I know  There wasn't that many  Bill-o-rama episodes  Right  Throw some Bill Burr bits at us 
[02:41:00]  Exactly  Stop being so deuce centric  I'm going to have to paw through  The what I consider  Bill-erific moments  Yeah  From the program  Yeah why don't you look  In the Bark Hives  Shit  Alright we'll cross off  Gymtastic then  If you want some  Bill Burr ideas  Him trashing  Cannonball Run 2  Was good  Him trashing  Bill Kelly  That bitch stinks  I'm just kidding  Him trashing  Bill Kelly  For being everybody's  Tech support

[02:58:00]  How much did the  Yeah  Harps  Diggity on Twitter  Has a very good question  How much did Beavis cost you  He's thinking thousands  No no  Beavis was pretty cheap  Why is he cheap  Is that a tough breed to get  No not really  A good  A good one  You know  I didn't want one with like a lot of marbling on him  Apparently  You want one with like  The spots  You know  What's marbling  It's when the color  Is just kind of  All like  Blotchy on him  But I wanted the one with the spots 
[02:58:30]  So he looks like a leopard  And then  I got him  Before he got all of his shots  So I got to pay for the shots  So he put the price down for that  What was it about  But it's like a grand  Okay  It's not that much  You're going to get another one  No  Two cats are perfect  Oh there he is  I'm playing with his little nose  Don't waste your viral videos with Vine man  No  If it's not viral  I'm just playing with his little nose  And he  Go right to the YouTube

[02:59:30]  Here he is eating a big bunch of food  I know that  I noticed that your angry tweets were drastically down  So  You think it's helping?  I think the kitten is helping  There's definitely a correlation between  Your angry tweets dropping  And the fact that you've got this beautiful little kitten  You might have something there  So let's get you a kitten every three months  I think  Let's get some  These are horrible habits  You're teaching it 
[03:00:00]  Oh I know  Just going after  As you try to tie your shoes  He's going to go after your ding-a-ling one day  Absolutely  I used to play fight with my cat when he was a kitten  It was cute  Right Sam?  Yeah  Now he's about 20 pounds  And just waits for somebody to come home  So he can pounce  Oh shit  He's like the fucking  Like the fucking butler  And uh  Pink Panther  The Asian helper  Yes  Keto  Just like his idea of a fun time  Is he sneaks up to you  And you pet him  You know  And he's like  Oh I'm just here for a cuddle 
[03:00:30]  And then wraps his paws around you  And sinks his claws of teeth  Into your arm  Oh man  Hard  So I gotta  Yeah I can't wait  Until the cuteness  Anthony's injured by this cuteness  No  And he's playing with his hands  What were you supposed to do?  You can't let him as a kitten  Play with your hands as a toy  Because then he becomes an old cat  And he'll just start clawing at your hands  When he sees them  Oh but it's adorable  Right now  Yeah  I'm teaching him all the wrong things  I can't wait  Until you come in all scratched up  The animal starts abusing you 
[03:01:00]  We were like  Why is our cat so horrible?  And then I found this tape I had  Of when he was a kitten  Yeah  And we were just like  Oh look at him  He's so cute  And we were letting him like  Bite our feet  And all that  And I go  Yeah  That's what happens  Although you know  Jack Jack used to play like this  As a kitten  And he was fine  As a grown up cat  Yeah  Sort of  Very cool  Yeah  I mean you know  It's cool  I'm just watching his nails  Go into your leg  And I'm like right now

[03:16:30]  60 seconds into those reads  Well  We are back from vacation  I hope everybody had at least some time off  For this Labor Day break  I don't know  Did you  Eric  Did you watch the James Franco roast?  No I didn't  I don't know  I was watching it  I came to this weird realization  In anticipation  I guess  For that roast  Because you gotta watch all the roast  And at first  I was like  Ugh  A James Franco roast  Because that's the reaction you have  Whenever James Franco's name is brought up 
[03:17:00]  You just go  Uh  James Franco's doing this  But I started to realize  I like everything James Franco has done  I think  I always have that  Ugh thing  Right before  And then when it happens  I'm like  No this is great  The movie that he did  Uh  This summer  This is the end  At first I go  Ah  Do I need to see another James Franco movie  And then I went to see it  And I was like  Yes  It was the funniest movie all summer  The roast though  What I like about a roast 
[03:17:30]  Maybe I'm in the minority  Maybe  Maybe people are nicer  Than I actually am  But what I like about a roast  Is  Just  Evilness  And meanness  You know  I like to sit there  And be like  Oh my god  The Flavor Flavor roast  For instance  Was great  Because people were sitting there  Calling him like a burnt up AIDS victim  Like these things  That you could not  Say to a person  But it's okay  Because it's done  Uh  In a funny way  Because great comedians  Are doing it  It seemed like  For the James Franco roast  It was more 
[03:18:00]  James Franco's friends  Are just kind of having a  Lighthearted good time with him  Was it all his friends?  Everybody was on the dais  You know  Seth Rogen was the host of it  Jonah Hill was there  Obviously Franco was there  Uh  Jason Segel I've noticed  Ever since he got  What's the sitcom he's on?  How I Met Your Mother  How I Met Your Mother  Yeah  Since he's got the  How I Met Your Mother thing  Outside of this sort of  Apatow universe  And the Muppets  And the Muppets  But really  How I Met Your Mother  He's got to be making  Tons of cash off that show  It's already syndicated 
[03:18:30]  Yeah  He doesn't  He doesn't show up  To all the Apatow things  He wasn't there  For the roast  And even in  This is the end  Where everybody  Got back together  He was only in  Like the first  Five seconds of that movie  He's got other things  To do  He's branching  Outwards  But these other guys  They just love  Hanging out with each other  The people who were  Hilarious on the road  Like Jeff  Jeff Ross did a great job  But he always does  A great job  You know  He snuck in a  Trayvon Martin joke  And it was funny  Sarah Silverman was great 
[03:19:00]  She spent like  A minute and a half  Just making Jonah Hill  Fat jokes  A lot of these people  But most of these people  Weren't comedians like that  Most of them  You got the feeling  That  You know  They wanted to have fun  With their friend  But they didn't want to  Ruffle any feathers  They didn't want to  Hurt any feelings  A lot of James Franco  Is gay jokes  Which are always good  But  And Andy Samberg  Just got real weird  He got real weird  He started  I guess he couldn't 
[03:19:30]  Commit to roasting  I don't know if anybody  Saw it  But  It wasn't  It wasn't my favorite  Roast of all time  It certainly wasn't  Eric  Who's in there with you?  Ron and Fez guys  Oh cool  What'd you do for vacation?  Because I was watching  I was following your Instagram  And  It seemed like a lot of video games  It was  Because  You know  I have an endless amount  Of  Stuff  Free time?  No  Endless amount of stuff  In what I call 
[03:20:00]  The vault room  At my house  Where it's toys  And games  And things like that  Is this  Are you just in a position  Where you've never  Thrown anything out  So you have all of your toys  From childhood  Now in your house?  There are a lot of things  That I did throw out  That I regret throwing out  Did you have to re-buy?  I haven't re-bought  Because some of it  Is just way too expensive  Like what?  Transformers  Original metal  Generation 1  Transformer toys  But you want to re-buy  You want  In a perfect world  You would re-buy your Transformers  I may have bought  One piece back  This week  This week? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah  From where?  Off eBay  Oh my  How much was it?  I got it good  Because the guy  Didn't know the value of it  Oh so you had to  And what did he like  I sniped it pretty good  And he titled it wrong  And everything?  No he titled it right  But he  When I talked to him  Before bidding  He gave me the whole description  Of everything  And based on all the photos  He was sending me  I was like  Alright done  And I bought it for way under  What it's supposed to be worth  So there was stuff  In the description  Like there was stuff  Left out of the description  That he didn't know  He should have in there  Exactly  How much did you buy it for?  I got it 
[03:21:00]  That plus shipping  50 bucks  How much is it worth?  It's at least  It could be over 100  Okay  Okay  It's a 50% markup possibility  Yeah  Okay  And depending  You know  Depending if it's  In perfect condition  Does it have all the stickers  Still on it  Was it in the box?  So do you know  The stickers?  Like if he sends you  A photo of this  Transformer  Does the character  Have a name?  It's five characters  That form one character  Like the Megazord  No this was before 
[03:21:30]  That Power Rangers shit  Oh I'm sorry  I didn't realize  Power Rangers wasn't cool anymore  You're young  It was never cool  To begin with  Oh it wasn't?  No it's Transformers  And Voltron  Oh sorry  I didn't realize  So what is the name  Of this creature  That comes together?  Devastator  Okay  It was the first  In the line  Where five robots  Would form one big robot  So that's a very exciting  Thing  The Constructicons  Right  Yes  So when he starts  Sending you pictures  Of the Devastator 
[03:22:00]  Do you know  Right off the bat  If it doesn't have  All its stickers  Do you know  Which stickers  Are supposed to be  On this thing?  Yeah  They don't have  A lot of stickers  On it  But they do have  Certain decals  Right  And also  Sometimes people  Don't realize  That shit is broken  So when they  Take a photo with it  It's like  Oh everything's intact  Great condition  Then you see  Like well that piece  Is clearly not connected  To the rest of the  To the robot anymore  Right  Right  Right  So you're  But you're feeling optimistic  I'm very  I'm very excited about it 
[03:22:30]  Now can you tell your wife  When you do stuff like this?  I could  She doesn't care  She doesn't want to hear it  So you don't tell  You don't tell her  That like you paid  The $50 for a transformer  On eBay  Not because she's  Going to give you  A hard time  But just because  She doesn't give a fuck  She wants nothing  To do with it  So she's just like  Who cares?  She's like  Alright keep it downstairs  That's it  Yeah  Why don't you  As long as she doesn't  Have to see it in the  Living room or the  Dining room  Honey could you share  Some of my interests  For a change?  Yeah that ain't happening  You've never had that talk? 
[03:23:00]  Well we've had that talk  You've asked her  To share your interests  No and she brought up  Certain situations  Where she noticed  That Jess goes to  Some of the things  That you're interested in  Right  And she has no interest  In a lot of those things  And then you know  We talk and she's like  Do you think  You want me to go to this?  I feel bad that I don't  Go to these things  And I said you probably  Would not have a good time  So you don't want her  There with you?  I would like her to  But I don't think  She would enjoy it  866-WOW-1-WOW  If you want to call in  To After Open Anthony Live  The thing with Jess is 
[03:23:30]  Because E-Rock and I  Are similar in some ways  I don't collect  Transformers as much  But  Collect wrestling figures  I have action figure collection  I have a couple  Right  You collect wrestling toys  And I do too  But the thing is  And I go to wrestling shows  All the time  And I watch wrestling  All the time  And that's the hobby  But  With Jess  I have to know  If I'm going to take her  To a wrestling show  And I will  I have to know  That she actually  Not that she wants to go 
[03:24:00]  Because she'll never  Actually want to go  But she can't  Not want to go  Because I would never  Take a girl to a show  And have them  The whole time  Being like  When do we get to go home?  When is this going to be over?  This is stupid  It looks fake  Why do you watch this?  Whereas  If I know she's going to be cool  Then it's like  Yeah of course you can come  And that's when I like  Like her to be there  But she always says  I think she was going for you  And not for the wrestling  Yeah but that's fine 
[03:24:30]  As long as she's going for me  And she's not being  Annoying about it  And she never is  Twati  Twati  Yeah I've never known her  To be Twati  So if that's the case  I don't care  I don't need her  To develop this passion  For pro wrestling  Like that  I don't even want  To share hobbies  You know what I mean?  Hello Larry  It's one day you wake up  She's wearing like  John Cena  And they start doing  Like you can't see me  Yeah I'm like  I don't want this  337  You're on the air  Yeah hi  I'm calling you  Is this two fags  With toys?  Yes  404 
[03:25:00]  You're on the air  You're on the air  No?  336  You're on the air  Can we teach an intern  How to screen calls maybe?  There's three new interns  Yeah we're teaching them  And Sal's just playing  Grab ass  With Roland in here  Oh that's  That's news to me  Yeah Sal and Roland  Are just in here  Play fighting  While you're in there  Trying to like  Talk to me  And run the board  And teach the interns  To screen calls  Yeah  Great  So yeah  But I  Like I don't 
[03:25:30]  Because I don't want a girl  To share  A weird hobby  Like I wouldn't want  To date a wrestling fan  But  I want them to be  Accepting of me  I did see  Something this weekend  That you had  That you had  Shown people  Where you were excited  That Jess and wrestling  Have come together  What's that?  In a photo where Jess  Met the ultimate warrior  I had to  You were so proud of that  Yeah because  I met the ultimate warrior  Before but that's  What I like to do  I like to take  Like old wrestlers 
[03:26:00]  And get them to take  I got a picture  With Jess and Superfly  I've got a picture of Jess  And the ultimate warrior  Just because I think  It's so funny  Mainly because  I post them on Facebook  And all Jess's  High school friends  See them  And they're like  What the fuck?  What is Jess doing  With the ultimate warrior?  She couldn't be less interested  Well she looked excited  In the photo  That's what I'm talking about  That's  I feel like  That's where  You know  You get what you need  Out of a marriage  Is  Was she faking it  Just to keep you happy?  No because she doesn't  Fake it 
[03:26:30]  Like she's one of those people  That's like  Okay well I just have  A good time  You know what I mean?  Like she's not gonna pretend  That she likes something  That she's not liking  But she will  Go out of her way  To have a good time  Like let me  Just bask in the  Or bask I should say  Let me bask in the absurdity  Of this  Like she's like  Oh this is funny  I'm taking a picture  With the ultimate warrior  That's the fun part  You know?  Yeah  Whereas a lot of girls  Would also  Might be like  Look I don't want  Anything to do with this  Which is where your wife 
[03:27:00]  Seems to be coming from  Look I don't want  Anything to do with this  And you're smart  To leave her at home  If she's gonna sit there  And not have a good time  Like she would go  If I asked her  And I said  Look this is important  Which it's not really important  But if I said it was  She would go  But I know she wouldn't  Have a good time  Going to any of the  To the cons  Or to wrestling stuff  Things like that  Yeah I mean  When I was in LA  A couple weeks ago  And I was doing  All those interviews  For SummerSlam  And everything  That I aired  On my Sunday show  Jess  Ridiculously pulled her weight 
[03:27:30]  Because she went  To all that stuff  And she was my  Camera person  And everything  She was the only  Person that was  There with me  And she was cool  About it  And that's what I need  Yeah you need  A camera person  Exactly  Look I need a woman  Who can hold  A camera study  Okay  Gabriel  Yeah Eric  I've got a bunch  Of old Transformers  The original  From the 80's  And I'll get rid of them  If you're interested  In buying them  This is not  Toy talk  Yeah what is this  Swap shop 
[03:28:00]  Sure  I'm not running  A tradeo here  This is a real show  Hit me up on Twitter  Sir we'll talk  Enough  Enough  Send photos  We're not doing  Any deals  I'll give you 10%  I watched  Okay  Finders fee  Yeah  Okay I like that  I was watching  It reminded me  You talking about  The Transformers  Things reminded me  I was watching  Something on Nat Geo  About a dude  Who  Like obsessive collectors  And this dude  Coincidentally enough  Had a room  He's 33 years old 
[03:28:30]  He's a truck driver  He's married  He's got two kids  And he's got  A room  And it's full  Of WWE toys  And Transformer toys  And that  But I mean  He buys everything  And he's out  At the stores  Every week  Buying stuff  And he's out  At conventions  Every week  Buying stuff  And he's going  To his wife  And he's telling her  Hey  You can't buy  Dunkin Donuts  Coffee anymore  It's too expensive  Hey  We need to cut back  On the food  This week 
[03:29:00]  Because  He wants the money  For toys  That's like my dad  When he was  Fully into smoking  Like he'd spent  Hundreds and hundreds  Of dollars  On cartons of cigarettes  A week  But then would complain  That my mom  Had six dollars  In texts  On her phone  Like what  What are you doing  What are you doing  Mama Nagel  You have no text  On your phone  That's something  You just gotta deal with  Yeah they have one  Of those old plans  That you know  Your screen's still  Kind of monochrome  Because it was  Bought by two companies  Ago  It's so funny  When your parents  Like are just 
[03:29:30]  Five steps behind  On technology  My dad was getting  A new phone  And  Because he had to  Because his phone  Like fell apart  He was fine with it  He had the same phone  For years  And he goes  To the store  The AT&T store  To get a new phone  And the guy goes  Alright so you're  Going to need to get  A new plan  With this phone  My dad goes  Well why don't I  Just keep using  My old plan  And he goes  Well we don't  Offer that  Offer that plan  Anymore  That's like  Way too few minutes  On that plan 
[03:30:00]  We don't even  It's not an option  Because my dad  Bought a phone  When you bought  When you use cell phones  For emergencies  And it was like  Five cents a minute  And so my dad  Was like okay  Well what's the  What's the lowest  Cell phone plan you have  And the guy goes  Well 200 minutes  Is the lowest  And my dad goes  No I don't need  200 minutes  And the guy goes  I think you'd be  Surprised Mr. Roberts  At how many minutes  You're actually using  On this thing  You know I mean  It really adds up  Throughout the month  And my dad goes  No I don't need  200 minutes  Give me a minute 
[03:30:30]  To minute  And they go  No you need a contract  Trust me  You'll use the 200 minutes  And my dad goes  I will not use  The 200 minutes  Go ahead  And he goes  He goes go ahead  Look up my last bill  Find out how many minutes  I used  So the guy like  Pulls it up  And everything  And he goes  Oh  My dad goes  What  What's oh  And he goes  It says here  You used three minutes  Last month  My parents used to have  Their old plan  Was with singular  And because it got  Bought by AT&T  So it was grandfathered in 
[03:31:00]  The plan's still active  But they don't have any  You know data  Texting  Any of that stuff  Nothing  It's just for the phone  And their old plan  Had the rollover minutes  So by the end of last year  They had to flush the account  And start over  Because so many minutes  Rolled over  That there was just no way  They were even going to use it  They would literally be able  To cancel their account  And just use rollover minutes  For the rest of their lives  Yeah exactly  Just thousands and thousands  Of rollover minutes  I think now my dad  Just decided to go ahead 
[03:31:30]  And get that  Two button phone  You know that they give  To old people  The cricket  Or whatever it's called  The life alert phone  It just has one emergency number  Programmed into it  Yeah he's fine with that  He just puts my cell phone  Number onto it  He's got his cell phone  And it's got one  Emergency number programmed  And it's mine  And he just calls me every day  Sam listen to the show  Hey listen  When did Ant turn that place  Into Fox News  That's it  That's what he uses  His emergency phone for  My dad would  He still gets mad 
[03:32:00]  Because the phone  Doesn't have a data plan  Right  So my mom will text  Especially if we're on the air  So you know  The phone won't ring  And he'll start screaming  And complaining  Why it's six dollars  Thirteen dollars  It's like what are you doing  Our plan doesn't have that  And she says  Why do you keep texting  Because nobody talks  On the phone anymore  Yeah because I'm using my phone  Like people use their phone  In this day and age  All my other siblings are working  So if she's writing to them  It's just easy to text  And get an answer right away  Than waiting for a phone call back  Yeah my mom  Just jumped on the texting bandwagon  Like this year 
[03:32:30]  I got my mom an iPad  Yeah yeah  This year  I got my mom an iPhone  Like a year ago  That's the next step  Is to get her the iPhone  It blows their mind  It's like  It's like  Having a child  And showing them a banana  For the first time  And they're like  Holy shit  You mean to tell me  That behind this rubbery thing  There's mushy deliciousness  This is blowing my mind  Yeah when you have  Other family members  That are saying  Oh well  I'm texting you a photo  Right now  It's not going through 
[03:33:00]  Yeah my plan  Can't handle a photo  Right  But you know  Everybody's passing  Family photos  Kid pics  Everything all around  And she can't be a part of it  Listen  If your family wants to  Pass around kid pics  Do what you gotta do  But it's not something  You should be saying on the air  That's gonna get people in trouble  It's their kids  Their grandkids  I don't think that's legal either  It is legal  Oh  Oh  I don't know  It's weird with the digital rights  And everything  That's the only thing  I'm concerned about  I wonder sometimes  What people like my dad  Must think 
[03:33:30]  When we go over to their house  And are just staring  At our phones constantly  And you know  You're pulling down  And refreshing Twitter  And you're responding  To text messages  And you're looking at Instagram  And you're playing Candy Crush  And he's sitting there going  What is going on?  What are they staring  At that thing for?  They're not making a call  I couldn't possibly know  What the use of that phone is  Let me go back to  Damien  We were talking about  Collecting too  What's up Damien? 
[03:34:00]  Hey Sammy  What's up buddy?  I just want to  Discourage you  It's a bad idea  To encourage Jeff  To go to a wrestling show  With you  Because it backfired  On me big time  How so?  Well I took my girl  To a wrestling show  About seven  Eight months ago  And we were about  Midway down the ramp  And where are you from?  Where are you from?  Illinois  Okay  And I blame him  Cody Rhodes  Because he was the first one 
[03:34:30]  He was the first one  To come out  And she looked at him  Looks at me  Looks back at him  And goes  You know  You can go to a gym  More often  You might actually  Be able to look like him  After that  You know  Miz came out  Oh you can look like him  And then John Cena  Came out  I was like  Don't even say it  Oh yeah  I don't know if it's  Going to wrestling shows  Or not  But Jess is definitely there  I think for me  It's just a matter of 
[03:35:00]  Jess looking at the  Average person  Walking down the street  And being like  Jesus Christ  You know  You could look like  An actual grown adult male  If you would go to a gym  Or something  Because on  She had me  Sunday morning  At eight o'clock  In the morning  Because Saturday night  We're sitting there  And it was early  And she's like  I'm going to boot camp  Workout  I don't know if you guys  Have heard of boot camp  Workout  But I  I'm sure it's not  Actually like boot camp  Is it like yoga?  No it's not like yoga at all  It's a guy  And he yells at you 
[03:35:30]  To do things  He makes you  Run  And then do push ups  And then do squats  And it's all  You know  Kind of  Endurance  Using your  Body resistance  For weights  Training  Does he yell at you  When you're crying?  Well  Well  And it's like  An hour of it  And it's like  You know  You run a hundred yard  Like you do  Ten push ups  Run a hundred yards  Ten squats  Run back a hundred yards  Take a drink of water  Then do squats  Then you know  All that stuff  That's what it is  And so  I'm going 
[03:36:00]  But it's mainly girls  In the class  So it can't be that hard  In my mind  And I think  For whatever reason  Sitting at home  Eating chicken fingers  And drinking Kool-Aid  Leaves me  In the shape  Of an Adonis  And I'm going  Well these girls  Can do it  I can do it  So I woke up  Sunday  At 8am  And I started  I started  I did the boot camp workout  And I'm doing my push ups  And I'm knocking them out  And I knocked out  The first twenty  Like  Deep  Real push ups  Nose touching the ground 
[03:36:30]  And just like  Look at these girls  Not even doing real push ups  That's because I didn't realize  That throughout the morning  There was going to be  More and more push ups  Like we were on a football field  And he wanted us to  To  To  To  Hop  Like jump  Not like hop on one foot  But jump  With all your body  Every ten yards  And at every ten yard line  Drop down and do ten more push ups  So I completely exhausted myself  Within the first fifteen minutes of this  Needless to say  By the time we actually have to do 
[03:37:00]  A four hundred yard dash  I have to stop at three fifty  At the garbage can  And I'm just puking everything up  I did the workout  Till you puke thing  And I'm watching all these women  Just run by me  And the guy goes  What are you doing rookie  Are you puking  I go yes I am  He goes that's great  I go no it's not great  It's embarrassing  Why are you yelling at me  Yeah  Why are you  Why are you hurting me  I'm obviously  I don't even know you  I'm in a vulnerable position  And then like  I'm like okay  I'm gonna be a fighter 
[03:37:30]  I'm gonna get back on the field  And I get back on  I start moving up the field  Jumping  Dropping down  Doing push ups  But like after two sets of them  I'm done  I'm about to throw up again  And the guy goes  Hey  Hey how you doing out there  Are you okay  And I'm like  Yeah I'm okay  He goes good  Alright so keep moving  The correct answer was no  I'm not okay  I've already vomited  And I don't vomit  From over activity often  But it did let me know  That I'm probably  Eating horribly 
[03:38:00]  And the inactivity  Is not working out  So maybe this is a good thing  No you're out of shape  In a different way  How you mean  Yeah because I'm  Why just malnourished  Malnourished  And lack of activity  Right  So that makes me realize  I just gotta keep doing it  You know it's a  It's a wake up call  Because otherwise  I'm gonna do it once  Every six months  And throw up every time  Okay  That's not  That's not necessary  I don't need the motivation  The slow mo package 
[03:38:30]  Showing you  Going through the boot camp  As long as Rob Bartlett  Is there with me  I'll be fine  Rob's yelling at you  As you're running up bleachers  Come on Sam  Why don't you run up  These bleachers Bartlett  He's drinking your water  Right  Yeah  This Gatorade's delicious  But bring orange  Next time  Throwing towels at you  Dressed up like Brian Wilson  For no apparent reason  What are you doing Bartlett  He was on the MTV VMAs  Would you eat  Fake apple  Made from fillers  And preservatives 
[03:39:00]  I probably would  Because I have a terrible diet  But it's a bad idea  What about a meatball  Made that way  Like most people  You want to be able  To pronounce every ingredient  That goes into your food  If you cook at home  You use real fresh ingredients  If you don't have time  To cook from scratch  Who's going to help you out  Mama Mancini's  Mama Mancini's meatballs  Is the answer for you  Mama Mancini's  Starts with 100%  USDA graded domestic beef  For their meatballs  And all natural ingredients

[03:40:30]  I got a couple  Things actually  For one  Quit being a  Fucking pussy  Yeah  The boot camp stuff  Jesus Christ  We're in the  Fucking military  Down here  I know  It's actual boot camp  And I'm sitting there  With like boot camp  Designed for soccer moms  And I'm still like  I'm exhausted  And all these soccer moms  Are going  You okay  You okay  Yeah I'm fine  I'm embarrassed  But I'm fine  I'm exhausted  I'm not used to this  Go on Adam 
[03:41:00]  Anyways  Regardless  For two  James Franco  He just seems like  He's too young  To be on a roast  Like think about  Dean Martin  And all that shit  Come on  He's too young  Like great  He's fancy  Nancy  And all nine yards  But  Yeah he definitely  Seems too young  But I think  I think  That they  Think to themselves  Well  He's got a whole  Bunch of famous  Friends that are  In comedy  And they're like  The hottest  Comic stars  Right now  So if we  Agree to do  James Franco  Who's a big star 
[03:41:30]  People will watch  And then all the  Seth Rogans  And Jonah Hills  Will show up  For this thing  It's overrated  It's all marketing  Yeah  Very good  Great call  Great call  Did you miss that Eric?  What?  I wasn't listening  Okay  So  You're digging through  Oh yeah  Because what I was watching  When we were talking  About collecting  I was watching this show  Nat Geo  And it's about  Obsessive collectors  And there's this dude  Like I said  He's 33  He's a truck driver  He's got two kids 
[03:42:00]  He's got a wife  And he's got a room  Full of wrestling  And Transformers toys  And I'm like  Jess you gotta see this  And she goes  Is he worse than you?  And I'm like  I don't know anything  About this worse stuff  Because I'm not bad  That's not good to hear  Yeah  Like what does that mean  Worse than you?  Well you do have  Closets at your parents house  Full of toys as well  Right  But that's from  When I was a kid  That's not  That's not like  The grocery money  Is going there  Like I said before  This guy  Is sitting there 
[03:42:30]  Telling his wife  To stop buying groceries  Because he needs money  For a new  Sinkara toy  Or whatever it is  And then  She brings a psychiatrist  To the house  To try to  You know  Get some logic  Into this dude's head  And what happens is  The psychiatrist  Just sits there  And goes  Okay will you at least  Cut back?  The guy goes  Yeah I'll cut back  The wife even goes  Look you don't have  To sell anything  Just cut back  He goes  Okay yeah  I'll cut back  And she goes  Well yeah  Just like you promised before 
[03:43:00]  So when was the last time  You bought a toy  And he goes  What just now  She goes  What?  While I was out  So while he's out  He's buying toys  And this is when  You know it's a problem  He's hiding them  In the car  Under a bunch of stuff  I'd like to think  That when I have children  And money gets to be that tight  I'm gonna have too much pride  To sit there  And be buying toys  Iraq with your toy collection  How big of a priority is this 
[03:43:30]  Cause for me  Like I might buy  A dumb wrestling thing  Like every couple months  You know what I mean  It's not  It's not a  It's not an every weekend thing  Yeah  It was when I was a child  But it's just not anymore  Because I don't have the means  Yeah  I don't have the means  To support this hobby  And also  I have a good looking wife  And I don't want her  Looking at me like  Really  We're going to a toy store  Every single week  Really  For you  Where's the priority level 
[03:44:00]  What would you  Cut off  To maintain your toy collection  Like if your wife said  Eric  It's not a financial problem  Yeah  We're good on money  Cause let's be honest  Eric  We both know  You're doing just fine financially  I do okay  But  If your wife goes  Eric  It's not a  It's not a financial problem  But for me  I just need you  To stop doing this  Because I don't like it  What do you say  Um  Okay 
[03:44:30]  I'm not buying  A lot of stuff  Like this guy  Seems to be  All the time  Like all his energy  And all his  Finances are focused on  Right  So we're not even there  We're not even saying  She's sitting there going  Well you should be doing this  But instead you're doing that  She's saying  I don't like it  It's not  Yeah  What would you do  Would you stop  Yeah it would depend  On what it was  Like how severe it was  That's it  She's saying  Look I need you  To stop doing this  I don't see why she would  But okay  But if she did  Cause you know  Some girls would  There are a lot of women 
[03:45:00]  I'm not saying  I'm not even using  Your wife as a specific example  To say you're  Women in general  The woman that you're with  Because there are a lot of women  That would say  Believe it or not  Eric  Yeah  And this is a tough one  For me to swallow too  There are a lot of women  Out there  That don't want to spend  The rest of their lives  With somebody that has  An action figure room  And that's crazy to me too  I don't understand it either  But  Who needs them  Who needs them indeed  Ew stinky stinky girls  We don't like girls  So what would you say 
[03:45:30]  If the woman you're with said  I guess I would have to  Because to get it to that point  Then you'd have to sit back  And look at it  And go okay  I gotta reassess this  What's causing this issue  I gotta tell you  Cause I do really well  With keeping it away from her  Well yeah  Cause you got that  Nice little room for yourself  She's not allowed  In the Nagel dungeon  She's allowed down there  But she doesn't want  To be down there  She has to go down there  Why does she have to  Well that's also where  You know  That's where you have to  Take shits in your house  No  That's the only bathroom  If you're gonna drop a deuce  In the Nagel household 
[03:46:00]  You gotta go downstairs  No it's free reign  Okay  Any bathroom  Anywhere  No  Any room  It doesn't matter  You got the washroom  And everything down there  For the  For clothes and stuff  Oh the washing machine  And she won't let me  Do the laundry  So she's gotta go down there  So she's gotta  That's rough dude  She has to go  Downstairs  She's doing your laundry  And stepping over  All your toys  Well it's not toys  Right now  But it is  There is stuff 
[03:46:30]  All over the floor  What's all  Because you don't  Clean up after yourself  No because I'm  In the middle of  Organizing stuff  Oh I see  I used to use that  Excuse my mom too  What are you in the  Middle of organizing  A project that I started  What's the project  Well restarted  Maybe a conversion  Of certain tapes  Oh you're taking  All the old O&A tapes  Yeah I found a new  DAT machine  That'll  That'll work with it  So she's like  You gotta bring  This shit home  Yeah she's like  What are these piles  I'm like  Don't touch that  That's the fall of 99 
[03:47:00]  Like don't knock that over  She's like  You  This is your work  You gotta bring  This shit home  I gotta walk over  While I'm doing  Your goddamn laundry  While I'm washing  Your Doctor Who t-shirts  This is embarrassing  There are a lot of  Doctor Who t-shirts  Does she let  She doesn't care  What you wear  She doesn't care  As long as I'm not  Wearing them  To when we have to go out  You know  She doesn't care  She's giving up  I think it's a little of both  A little of both  A little like  Maybe in a different world  She would care  But she knows the effort  That it would take  So why bother  She buys me nicer clothes 
[03:47:30]  Because she doesn't  Trust my judgment  That's okay  So she's trying to  Infiltrate from within  Yeah  Like all of a sudden  It's like  Oh look  Here's some new jeans  New shoes  Dress shirts  Oh this is great  Does that work  It works  I wear them  Honestly you're wearing them  To work  I don't wear them to work  No  No not at all  Because why would you  No I wear them out  To family things  Sure  But then all of a sudden  You know  Two more Doctor Who t-shirts  Show up in the mail  Don't worry baby  We got the money  We're good  Enjoy yourself 
[03:48:00]  Live a little  I know  T-Fury had a sale  T-Fury  Matt in Pennsylvania  Hey Sam what's up  How you doing buddy  Hey listen  There's two parts  To this comment  One  I can't believe  You guys actually  Collect toys  I think that's  The gayest thing  I've ever heard  And it's impossible  You know what's worse  It's impossible  He's a sports fan  It's impossible  Yeah you could  But it's impossible  To defend  Because you can't  Sit there and say  Because logically  It's not that much 
[03:48:30]  Different from any  Other type of memorabilia  But adults  In large numbers  Do not do this  So  Here's the defense  Here's the defense  You guys are late  Walking in on this  You can collect  Anything you want  In front of your girls  How many times  Do you guys  Go buy shoes  How many times  Do you go buy purses  How many times  Do you guys  Get massages  Facials  Pedicures  Manicures  Any of that  Damn much money  That costs  Right  They say something  About what you buy 
[03:49:00]  Regardless of whether  It's a faggity toy  Or not  You're allowed to  Collect whatever you want  Because they spend  A lot more money  Than we do  That's just a fact  That's right  That's right Matt  Chip just walked in  Is the meeting over?  No  I'm not gonna get Jim  Am I?  Something's brewing  No insight on  And Chip just leaves  Some fucking shit's brewing  Okay  I heard you the first time  He stares at you 
[03:49:30]  Very angrily  And he does it like  He's like  Oh wait till he gets  A load of this one  This is gonna be  Really funny  No I mean  Women don't have  The right to tell you  What to buy  And what not to buy  But when you're  When it's at the cost  Of the relationship  Or the family  Like this dude also  He sits in his toy room  He plays with his toys  He makes videos  Like little stop motion  Wrestling movies  With his toys  And it's like  All this stuff  Is nothing that I do  I go out  I get an action figure  I'll put it on the shelf  And I feel like  That should be acceptable 
[03:50:00]  To anybody  Well you do adjust  The belts according  To Raw and Smackdown  Every week  It's for decorative purposes  I don't want  Somebody to come  Into my house  Hey that guy  Doesn't have that title  And realize  Yeah hey  Listen  Two months ago  What's John Cena  Doing with that belt  And I'm like  You're right  I'm embarrassed  I'm embarrassed  That you saw that  I don't want to be  Embarrassed  E-Rock  So yeah  On the toys  That are on display  I'm gonna change the belts  To match  The accurate championship  But beyond that  I treat my shit 
[03:50:30]  Like an adult  Okay  It's there  The same way  I don't know  What she was thinking  Jess  Got a rubber elephant  Painted it gold  And put it on our table  And said  This is a centerpiece  I said  I don't know  What that means  But I'll accept it  I like the fact  That there's a gold elephant  On the table  You should put the big show  On top of it  Like he's riding it  Yeah  I'll be like  What?  It's a centerpiece  It's the big show  Riding a golden elephant  Everybody's gonna get  A kick out of that  Let's have some company over  Everybody's gonna be like 
[03:51:00]  Oh where'd you get  That centerpiece from  And we'll be able to say  That we made it  As a couple  It's romantic  Bruce  Yeah hey guys  If you're interested  I've got six glass butt plugs  From the original  Transformation package  I love  I love that  He got through the intern too  The screen says  He's got six of the  Original transformers  Look  She's trying  Look I know she is  She's new  She's also extremely bored  Of this conversation  Why?  Because this does not  What's her name?  This one is Nicole 
[03:51:30]  Nikki  Nikki  Bring Nikki to the microphone  Okay  Nikki come here  Nikki  Put the headphones on  Nikki  Nikki can you hear me?  I can hear you  You're a good looking girl  How old are you?  I'm 22  Okay you're 22  What happens  Are you dating anybody?  Yes I am  You have a boyfriend  For how long?  Almost a year  Okay  What happens if  You're dating this guy  And it's casual  How long was it  Before it was serious  Would you say? 
[03:52:00]  Like five months  Oh so it was five months  To just kind of casual dating  And then it became a thing  Yeah  Well we would get out together  For nine months before that  And then it became official  So it was serious  Oh my gosh  Well  What happens if it becomes serious  You start spending more time with him  And you've already put a couple months into this  But  You realize he's sitting at home  Collecting toys for himself  I would not date that person  You would run away  Why?  Why can't a guy collect  E-Rock this doesn't  This is not going well for us 
[03:52:30]  Yeah but he's also single  And she's  Well technically single  You weren't married  You weren't collecting shit  When you were single?  Me?  Yeah  Yeah I was  But it wasn't on display  Oh no  Now that she's locked in  It's like look  It is what it is  It is what it is  Guess what we're doing  With this space  You got the rest of the house  This is my decor  Okay so what about that Nicky  What happens if now  He goes look  I didn't want to share this with you  Until we really knew each other  Because I had to explain it to you  The right way  But  I need you to know 
[03:53:00]  That I like to  I like to buy Transformer toys  Well it depends  How much he's spending  And how crazy he is about it  What if he's not  Like he's like look  I'll still take you out  To a beautiful dinner  Check out a movie  We'll go to the clubs  Nothing  I'm buying you drinks  Left and right  It's no problem  But  How old did you say you were?  I'm 22  Okay like I said  No problem  But  What I like to do  In my free time is  I like to buy Transformers  And turn them into Optimus Prime  Is that a problem for you?  Yeah  It is  Okay 
[03:53:30]  I was worried about that  You see what I mean  About it not being defensible  Why is it a problem for you?  Because don't you ever  Grow out of that?  Yeah you're supposed to  I guess it does  Kind of really  Seem like  You have some kind of  Retarded development  It does  Thank you Nicky  You're probably right  I mean honestly  She's probably in the right  734  Hey Samuel  How you doing sir?  What's up buddy?  Hey  I got a stick up for E-Rock  Actually  Growing up  I used to collect 
[03:54:00]  Like Star Wars  And Micronaut toys  And I've been trying  To buy some of this stuff  Back actually  And it's a pain in the ass  Because  I wish I never lost  These damn things  Because  Why do you want them now?  I'm still a 5'5 fan  I got that stuff  Like  You know  I got like a room  Similar to like  Some of the guys  With the Big Bang Theory  You know  Toys  I got them  See Nicky  What did you say  Your name was sir?  This is Snowy  From Michigan  Alright  Tell Nicky  That Snowy  Is a cool guy  And he has toys 
[03:54:30]  Or toy room  Like the Big Bang Theory  Does Nicky watch  The Big Bang Theory?  All the kids love  The Big Bang Theory  Isn't that right Pips?  Sure  She does not watch it  Oh  Oh  She says she goes out  At night  Oh  Well that's different then  Well one day  She'll be married  And she'll be sitting at home  And her husband  Will be like  Listen  I've been lying to you  For a long time  Here's my toy collection  And that's gonna be it  And she's gonna have to  Deal with it  Right Snowy?  I collect Ben 10  Ask her how many shoes  She has  How many shoes  Does Nicky have? 
[03:55:00]  She has a lot  Grow up Nicky  Only kids buy  That many shoes  Stop being a little kid  Nicky  With all your shoes  Thanks Snowy  Anytime Sam  Alright  Does Nicky feel embarrassed?  No  She should  She's acting like  A little kid  With a whole bunch  Of little baby shoes  You make them  Fight each other  Ask her if she makes  The shoes fight each other  She said definitely not  Oh  I was hoping she said yes  Because if she did  My argument would be  So much stronger  She's also rolling her eyes 
[03:55:30]  At you  She is  This is why interns  Don't take me seriously  This is day one  This is a terrible place  To start  Listen  Toys vs shoes  Toys vs shoes  What did this show become?  No wonder we're getting  New management  I started with you asking me  About video games  And this is where it went  This is where it leads to  Trust me  If Gary really is  Leaving this channel  And we're getting  New bosses  You're not gonna be  Seeing this after show  Around much longer  I can't imagine  Anybody actually  Managing  We could just replay  The first hour of the show  Before Ron and Fez  Have we ever tried  To just fill that time  With worst of? 
[03:56:00]  That seems like a good idea  Dead air is a step  In the right direction  Right  Right  Just somebody to read  The live reads  If  If  You're gonna ask any girl  Any woman at all  What the best gift  She ever got was  You know what she's  Gonna tell you?  The Wrestlemania collection  Of toys  From Mattel  No  She'll never say that  You know what she'll say  Without hesitation  Without even thinking about it  She'll say it was  Her engagement ring  Do you know  The rock  That I had to give Jess  For her to put up  With the fact  That I had the rock 
[03:56:30]  On my bookshelf  Was it from the  Attitude era  Or was it the current one  With Mattel?  It was both versions  It was a display  Of the rock through time  Okay  Alright  And to have that  She should be so lucky  Laying on your shelf  You have to get her  A big honking diamond  When you ask her  To marry you  It's so important  It's not just a ring  This is why  It's not just a  A sign of affection  It's everything to her  Every time she looks down  At her fingers  She'll think  Every time she washes  Her hands  She's thinking
