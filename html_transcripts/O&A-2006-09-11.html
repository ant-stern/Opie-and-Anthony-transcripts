<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie and Anthony, along with James Norton and Robert Reed, engaging in self-deprecating and offensive humor, referencing their past arrests.  Technical difficulties with Norton's headphones provided an early comedic interlude.  A substantial portion of the show was dedicated to a scathing critique of the media's 5th anniversary 9/11 coverage, which the hosts deemed overly sentimental, exploitative, and lacking genuine emotion.  They vehemently criticized the repetitive nature of the coverage, the ubiquitous sad music, and the absence of acknowledging the anger and rage many felt.  Offensive language was liberally used, particularly directed at news organizations and Muslims.  Listener calls provided a mix of agreement and disagreement with the hosts' perspective, fueling further discussion on the appropriateness of the media's approach and the emotional response to the anniversary.  The show also briefly highlighted the success of their recent live show in Camden, New Jersey.

The Camden show segment focused heavily on the overwhelmingly negative audience reaction to comedian Jimmy Schubert, who was booed relentlessly.  The lineup included Rich Voss, Jimmy Schubert, Tracy Morgan, Ralphie May, Patrice O'Neal, Bob Saget, Bob Kelly, Dom Irrera, and Bill Burr.  Dom Irrera also faced some scattered boos.  A particularly memorable moment was Bill Burr's performance.  Initially booed, possibly due to an off-hand comment about Irrera and audience unfamiliarity, Burr launched into a fifteen-minute, highly offensive rant insulting Philadelphia and its people, culminating in a standing ovation.  The hosts and other comedians backstage reacted with disbelief and laughter.  Listener calls from Philadelphia confirmed the booing incidents and Burr's successful turnaround. The segment also detailed a chaotic meet-and-greet, disastrous room service at the Sofitel (including missed orders and wrong deliveries), Bob Kelly vomiting repeatedly after seeing an ear infection, and the proliferation of bootleg recordings of Burr's set online.  Opie again expressed anger towards the 9/11 media coverage, announced an upcoming Damon Wayans appearance and a contest, and Bill Burr joined the studio discussion.

Bill Burr and Damon Wayans joined Opie and Anthony in-studio.  The show started with MacBook giveaway announcements and Opie's planned 9/11 tribute involving disconnecting PalTalk users.  The conversation shifted back to Burr's Camden experience, discussing the challenges of stand-up comedy, particularly in challenging cities and with different audience demographics (Black and Italian crowds specifically referenced). Damon Wayans discussed his new Showtime series, *The Underground*, detailing its edgy and offensive sketches (vaginas, cannibalism, a superhero with a large penis). The Wayans brothers' competitive nature and *In Living Color* anecdotes were also shared.  The discussion returned to the 9/11 anniversary coverage, with the hosts expressing their opinions using offensive language. The show concluded with further anecdotes, technical difficulties, listener interactions, and more vulgar jokes and commentary.  The broadcast contained frequent use of offensive language, including racial slurs, misogynistic remarks, and jokes about disability.

A later segment featured Sonny Ferelli's rambling, incoherent story about a trip to Camden with Master Poe, involving getting lost, asking for directions from a toothless man, and a bizarre encounter with a couple that led to a ping pong and bowling discussion. Master Poe later called in.  The conversation then shifted to a news story about a six-year-old girl with brain cancer whose wheelchair and medication were stolen.  The hosts expressed outrage and solicited donations.  Criticism of Tom Brokaw's 9/11 coverage followed, along with a caller recalling the Opie and Anthony show's 9/11 coverage and criticizing 9/11 tribute songs, particularly one by John Valby (which was played on air, along with another poorly-received patriotic song).  A news segment about a cockroach interrupting a weather report and a discussion of *Survivor* controversy were also included.  Bill Burr promoted his shows, and Mark Burnett, creator of *Survivor*, discussed his new AOL game, "Gold Rush," and defended the *Survivor* season.  A final caller shared a bizarre encounter with a swinger couple.

A final segment featured a lengthy discussion with a female guest (“Swing Girl”) detailing her experiences as a swinger, using graphic language and descriptions.  Roland, a nervous staff member, was repeatedly teased and attempted awkward listener interviews.  A Jerry Springer campaign ad from 1980, where Springer admitted to an affair, was played.  The show concluded with more vulgar banter and jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Despicable human beings in the country. Creeps.  Ankle biters.  Obviously the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  Alright, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:00:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible. I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch, corn balls, three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[00:01:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Great.  I'll just sit here and listen to half the show today.  Half the show.  Out of my left ear.  If anything good happens and it should have been in my right ear, can someone tell me so  I can chuckle? 
[00:01:30]  What the hell?  Hi, welcome.  Hope you're in Anthony's show.  What's wrong?  My headphones still aren't working.  I, I, I, I, I.  I put the, the effing plug in.  I think it's this, the box.  It's always the box, isn't it?  Why isn't it fixed?  God damn it.  Holy.  Holy, I want to curse. 
[00:02:00]  Oh.  Oh.  A tragedy happens to my headphones on today.  I want to mark this date.  September 11th, the day my headphones didn't work.  Oh, so they're over there now.  Good.  So if Jimmy wants to deafen me, he's got all the power.  Is that the right?  Loud and clear.  Please not.  That would kill me.  Oh.  Good morning and welcome to a very special.  Good. 
[00:02:30]  I'll just play the old man in the sea reeling in a marlin over here.  What the heck?  It's, it's ten feet away.  I said good morning and welcome to a very special.  Oh.  Opie and Anthony's show.  Very special.  What are you, what are you doing today?  That poor girl.  What are you doing?  I don't even know her name.  She comes in and says hi to us every Monday morning.  We just lash out at her.  Because I guess they play music here on Sunday nights. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, well.  That's what they do.  I know this much.  Philly kicked our ass and we're a bit surly today.  Philly kicked our ass.  From Thursday afternoon all the way to Sunday afternoon.  It was just, uh.  Philly just beat the crap out of us.  Action packed.  They were great to us.  I know.  We'll get into all that.  No worries.  Yeah.  No worries.  The ONA traveling virus was a huge success down at the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey. 
[00:03:30]  We have to start.  And I get into the office and we're looking at all the morbid headlines for today.  Yeah.  Um, I couldn't even watch TV last night.  Because you know what?  I choose not to feel freaking depressed.  I choose that.  That's it.  I choose that.  You choose.  We lived it.  We live it every day of our lives.  And I broadcasted that day.  We broadcasted for the next, what, two and a half, three weeks without a joke.  Oh, it was just a pleasure.  Taking people's stories about I lost, uh, I lost my father. 
[00:04:00]  I lost my mommy.  I lost this.  It was brutal.  Brutal.  And people were like, are you going to replay any audio from, uh, five years ago when you  guys were on the air?  No!  No!  We did our broadcast five years ago.  We did, uh, about two and a half, three weeks after that.  And then we finally were able to kind of move on and, uh, you know, get the show back together.  And then, and, and in a way we all try to get our lives back together.  Right.  And to this day, I've never, ever listened to one of those broadcasts we did. 
[00:04:30]  I have no desire.  I don't want to.  And I listened to every single radio show we do.  Yeah.  I listened to them over and over again.  And, uh, that, that, that two, three week period of our careers, I, I don't want to ever  hear any of that audio again.  It's out there.  But people are like, are you going to play any clips from five years ago?  And I understand a lot of people are in that, uh, well, you know something, it's the only  way we, we remember, never forget things like that.  Look, I haven't forgotten every frigging morning. 
[00:05:00]  I drive up the expressway, heading toward the Midtown Tunnel.  And I see the Empire State building every morning.  See, nice and lit up.  I see the Chrysler building.  It's all nice.  Top of it lit up.  Love it.  And then every morning I look over to the left.  Just do it.  And look and go, son of a bitch, they're gone.  Every morning it's on my mind.  Don't worry.  I'm not forgetting, I just don't need these news organizations every year and now, especially 
[00:05:30]  on a 50 year anniversary to put this morbid, uh, ratings grabber on television.  Cause that's all it is.  Yeah.  Cause they're all now sitting around the pit with, with their partners all dressed like  where's the frigging whore that shows her cans every morning.  She's in a goddamn turtleneck today.  Her hair all pulled back.  Not a smile to be found.  She's frowning, frankly, frowner.  She just frowning. 
[00:06:00]  And they keep showing, uh, photo montages of, of nine 11 with the most morbid music that  you know, they were like, uh, could we get, no, it's not bad enough.  Oh, you know, they sat around in a, in a conference room, like, all right, we got samples  of really, really sad music and they play it and, and people like, yeah, it's pretty  sad, but I think we could get even a sadder with our music going into commercial.  That's right.  Going into a promo for a house.  Yeah.  Boy, you really care that you didn't even, uh, think about going commercial free. 
[00:06:30]  Did ya?  Did ya?  The show must go on.  You know who needs to be reminded?  It's the stupid people that start feeling guilty about racial profile in airport.  You're the ones that need to be reminded.  What do you remember?  I hate them and I've always hated them and I'm going to continue to hate them.  Right.  I don't be reminded of anything.  That's it.  They're awful.  Here you go.  You, you, you want my remembrance?  I'll, I'll never forget the smell of plastic and dead people, okay?  There you go.  There you go.  That's a good memory.  Happy anniversary, everyone. 
[00:07:00]  Happy anniversary.  Happy effing anniversary.  How about the fact that yesterday.  Death in the air.  That's what I remember and I'll remember until I, uh, the, until the day I die.  Plastic and death for days and days.  Maybe we shouldn't have had a, uh, uh, a Muslim day parade here yesterday in Manhattan too.  Maybe that was a bad timing, but that happened.  How about that?  How about remembering so much that you don't let those savages, uh, march in our city the day before September 11th? 
[00:07:30]  There are plenty of ways you can remember without these news organizations.  Ugh, the news.  Look, Channel 7 here in New York, you know, that, that bitch on the right, her hair is down every single morning.  But today, I mean, they thought this out.  Let's wear dark clothes, dark suits.  Let's look like dignified people.  And let's make sure our hair is pulled back.  Uh, let's tone down the makeup a little bit.  We're in mourning.  Oh, great.  And you get to see, uh, you get to see Ground Zero.  Ah!  Would have been nice to pan up to see what, uh, progress has been made in five years. 
[00:08:00]  That's the biggest, uh, uh, depressing thing of the day is that all these news people are sitting in front of a hole in the ground that should have buildings going up.  But because of red tape and other bull crap, uh, there's nothing there still.  The media has realized that they, they have to be careful how they tabloid 9-11.  They know they have to be careful with it because they're such scumbags, but they know even on this one they have to be careful.  Yeah.  It's a great day for them because now they can and no one can criticize them.  Yeah.  Well, they're just reporting. 
[00:08:30]  They're just reporting.  It was five years ago.  Was it?  All day they're going to stay there.  So all day long.  And they are the ones who need to be reminded, not people who live here.  No, believe me.  Every day.  So everyone, um, is a reminder here.  So, you know, management that, uh, you know, works above us.  They're all asking, so what are you guys going to do on 9-11?  You're going to play some of the, uh, some of the audio from, uh, your show that day?  No.  And so then we're sitting around in our office, right?  We're just tired.  Philly kicked our ass and we're trying to get ready for today's show. 
[00:09:00]  And, uh, the, the chick that does, I don't know, overnights here comes walking in and  just said the wrong thing.  After hearing it from everybody, I could, I, I could even imagine she walks in and goes,  so what do you guys got planned for today?  We yelled at her so much.  She, she, she walked out almost in tears.  Same thing we have planned every day.  Mediocrity.  Yeah.  Like it's something about pulling my C out.  And then Steve really did.  I just got like really belligerent and then apologize. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, we, we do apologize, but we heard it so many times that we, we just didn't need  to hear it anymore.  And you would, you happen to be in our way.  And then, uh, I'm getting emails from Steve all weekend long that some of the radio stations  we broadcast on are going to do their moment of silence and all, dude, do whatever you  have to do, do whatever you have to do.  Ringing bells, moments of silence, reading of names, the same stuff they've done every year.  You know, if it makes you feel better, that's fine, but, uh, it should be a more personal  thing.  I think the news are vultures. 
[00:10:00]  They are vultures that circle and just wait till they smell blood and sorrow.  And that's when they dive down and have to smack everyone in the face with this.  Why do they have to broadcast with, with, with, with the, uh, ground zero behind them?  Why?  Yeah.  No one doesn't know what day it is.  We know what day it is.  We know where it happened.  We know everything.  And again, I'm going to smack anyone that gives me the, we got to remember what you want  to forget. 
[00:10:30]  No, we're never going to forget.  Every single day is a memory.  Every single day.  Here's the headlines.  And we're going to do this all morning.  Okay.  New York post nation honors terror victims, living tribute to world trade center.  Fallen.  And this warrior was forced to give up his sword daily news vow.  Never forget.  President Laura Marks solemn tributes at ground zero.  Some of my friends buried there.  These are just headlines.  Uh, the kinship of a tragic day, uh, rebuilt FDNY arises from ashes.  Okay.  That's a, uh, uh, an uplifting story. 
[00:11:00]  Bravest blessing USA today nation stops again to remember.  Will nine 11 define a generation?  New York times broken ground portraits of grief over and over.  Over and over again.  Did you, you, you, the post headline though.  Um, did you mention that it was cut in half?  No, not yet.  Yeah.  Well, the New York post here in New York, you know, a paper that just stinks.  Uh, they have, uh, four fits of the, of the front page is, uh, Barbara and Laura there. 
[00:11:30]  Uh, Barbara, sorry, George and Laura at ground zero lying, uh, you know, lying down the,  laying down the reef, um, like ground zero.  And it says tribute Bush at ground zero for nine 11 rights.  And then, um, the, I said that, you know, that's four fifth of the front page.  The other fifth is six million scratch and win new game card inside.  It's the monopoly guy under the, the, the nine 11 headline.  It's the monopoly guy with a $6 million scratch and win offer. 
[00:12:00]  So today's numbers, page 51.  Yeah.  Look, you know, the monopoly guy that's on the get out of jail.  He's got like a little round fat face and a white mustache and a little hat and his little  Abe Lincoln hat, a little hat.  That's the guy under the wreath.  They're laying for nine 11.  The post has a picture of this guy because they got to do their little game.  Phony scumbag.  To sell papers.  Yee.  There we go.  That's what I need to see.  More people running from wreckage.  Is, is there, is there, is there anything on? 
[00:12:30]  Is comedy central doing something?  The problem is the media just won't admit what they do.  That's the problem.  They won't acknowledge like, yeah, we, we know people are going to be watching.  So, uh, I wonder if they're doing free advertising today.  I wonder if no one's paying for commercials.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  I doubt it.  No, if they really care, they would have went commercial free.  Yeah.  And donated all that money.  How about that?  All the money that comes in on nine 11 since you're capitalizing off it financially.  Why don't you donate all that money?  Ah, that's some type of a victim's family's fund.  Why don't you do that?  I just want one member of our show to make one statement about the whole thing to wrap it up. 
[00:13:00]  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  There you go.  Our own Steve.  Uh, well, here we go.  Here's a, here's a little, a little taste of what's going on today.  That was Dick Brennan reporting.  And as I was watching that piece, you see the artwork there.  From the children, there were hundreds of children who were left without their parents  who could call them the youngest victims in all of this.  Yeah.  Coming up next this morning, how they're learning to live beyond the heartache and loss. 
[00:13:30]  I think it's easy to sit, but I'll get it when you walk down.  Listen to the music.  Listen to that music bed that they play coming in and out of spots.  Oh, my God.  And, uh, last night, you know, we got back from Philly, really tired, and, uh, turn on  the TV.  Every channel was doing something.  Every channel.  Oh, they couldn't start fast enough.  And then, you know, the footage alone is just brutal to watch. 
[00:14:00]  I watched a little bit, like everybody else.  And then I'm like, why am I doing this?  Why torture yourself?  And then what made me change the channel, uh, I forgot what channel it was, but they're,  you know, they're doing their, their footage.  And then there, you hear the, uh, the noises of people falling.  Yeah, that's nice.  And everyone knows that's what the noise was, but they have to remind you what you're hearing.  What you're hearing now.  Are people jumping to their own deaths.  Yeah, jumping to death.  Yeah, there's a lot of that footage they wouldn't show.  They, you know, they, they deemed some of it was too tasteless to show. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  Show the, that's good ogre-ish.  God bless VH1.  They know who they are.  Celebrity Fit Club and Flavor of Love.  Is that what they're doing?  Oh, they weren't going to stop their programming.  They weren't going to fake anything.  Doing an I Love the 80s.  Right.  Marathon.  Right.  But that's what made me change.  I'm like, why am I doing this to myself?  I know that's the noise of people falling to their deaths.  You don't need to remind us.  And I also don't need to hear about things, diversity and healing and stuff like that.  Because when I, when I've watched 20 times already this morning alone, where you have 
[00:15:00]  to watch, I got people screaming and cursing and, oh my God, I can't believe what I saw.  Yeah, I know.  I remember.  And then I don't have to hear, what it does, it doesn't make me so much sad for everybody.  It makes me so angry and so, like, vengeful that I just want to kill Muslim people.  That's what it does to me.  Oh, I know there are good ones and this and that and they'll tell you this, that, that. 
[00:15:30]  But all this coverage makes me hate.  It doesn't heal me.  It doesn't make me feel like we've gone on five years and we're great as a country and  we're all brought together in this and blah, blah, blah, melting pot.  We've all come together with, it makes me a bigoted, hateful man for a savage, Middle  Eastern race and religion of people.  That's what it does.  Congratulations, News.  You did it. 
[00:16:00]  Thank you.  I'm a hateful, hateful person.  Dude, and I'm proud to say, because they did call us, David Hinckley's column in the New  York Daily News, he does the radio column.  So he's listing what every radio station in New York's doing today to remember 9-11 five  years later.  You want to hear what some of the other radio stations our competitors are doing today?  Oh, let's hear.  That's sincere.  All right.  Well, let's start with WAWZ.  What is that? 
[00:16:30]  The Morning Team places 2,948 American flags near studios on Weston Canal Road in New Jersey.  A publicity stunt, a radio publicity stunt, you scumbags.  Why don't you do something with a 9-11th caller, you creeps?  Uh, WBAI, an alternative look at September 11th and its aftermath with a focus on how government  and media have manipulated public opinion and policy.  That's good.  They'll bore people to sleep and you'll sleep right through the whole day.  God, that's, I, my hat's off to them. 
[00:17:00]  I apologize.  I'm going to apologize now for the laugh I'm about to have.  All right.  11 a.m., Marl Becker of OutFM talks about gays involved in September 11th.  Stop it, you separatist fruit.  Why?  Why?  Here's the difference.  You cried with a hug in your face.  That's the difference.  Are you kidding me?  Two big mules standing straight up and his mouth plays the plane. 
[00:17:30]  Talks about gays involved in September 11th.  Oh, God.  Stop it, mighty.  Why?  How is it different than anybody else?  To be a gay guy.  Other than the fact that God loves us and approves of us.  How is that different?  Let's see.  You separatist fruit.  That could be the light of the sentence.  Enough.  Let's see.  Oh, my God. 
[00:18:00]  Let's all just take sides.  Good.  Good.  Good.  CBS FM.  What are they going to do?  Well, they've got to tone it down a little bit today.  It's acoustic, commercial-free music all day.  Acoustic.  So they're going to be playing sad music.  I bet 800 versions of yesterday.  What's wrong with an electric guitar today?  I bet 800 versions of yesterday.  Right?  Why is electric guitar bad?  I don't know.  What's wrong?  Why only acoustic?  Only acoustic.  All day, listener requests and remembrances on WFUV.  That's just a pull at the heart.  All day, listener requests and what? 
[00:18:30]  Remembrances?  Remember.  So they'll say something about what they remember, and could you play this certain song that ties into it?  Great.  More sadness.  It'll be just stuff like, hello, is this WFUV?  Yes!  Oh, sorry.  Oh, no.  Samba.  All right, let me play the listener.  Hello, is this WFUV?  Uh, yeah, yeah, F-U-V.  What can we do for you?  Are you taking a listener request today?  Yes, all day long on this September 11th, we're remembering, taking your remembrances, and playing your requests. 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  I think an appropriate song today would be Everybody Hurts by R.E.M.  Ah, yes, everybody.  And we do have to remember that everybody is hurting today.  And I think this song goes out to everybody.  This isn't something that maybe one person or two can relate to.  We're all hurting today, aren't we?  Oh, great. 
[00:19:30]  Just filled with hatred.  That's all I'm filled with on September 11th.  Hatred for a savage people that wanted nothing more than to see every American and every one of our institutions,  our great institutions that we've spent time building because we're a great people.  And you suck your filthy animals.  Start with a bath and then move on to the wheel and fire. 
[00:20:00]  And then maybe someday you'll be great.  It just makes me hate.  That's what it does.  I'm full of hatred today.  That's all.  No remembrance.  No sorrow.  No love of this, that, the other thing.  I hate you.  What friggin' stations play in this? 
[00:20:30]  What is this?  This is what Steve listens to when he meditates.  This is the music they're playing over a montage right now on Fox 5 here.  On Fox.  So they're playing the pictures of missing people.  Remember that?  They were posted all over the place.  There's the smoke rising above the financial center. 
[00:21:00]  There's a nice FDNY shirt with the names of the dead on the back.  There's a candlelight vigil.  There's I'll always remember you with drawing of the towers.  There's...  I...  Didn't they want to say, like, when they put, like, the tributes for, like, the memorial at Ground Zero?  Yeah, the one they can't figure out what to do, so there's still nothing there?  Aren't there people who are saying that we don't want to mention Islam or we don't want to mention, like, the fact that they were Islamic radicals? 
[00:21:30]  Yep.  I mean, you're not going to blame all religion, but that's what they were.  Right.  And they were self-proclaimed Islamic radicals.  Of course they were.  And a lot of people don't want to know how we shouldn't mention...  Why?  Why shouldn't we?  Mention it.  You know why?  Because the first thing they think up, these friggin' morons think up to put it Ground Zero, and that's why there's still nothing there, by the way, is because they're batting things back and forth and entertaining the thoughts of idiots!  There are people that want a diversity center down there.  A diversity...  A diversity museum! 
[00:22:00]  It's a whole thing on how we suck, and we've done nothing but slam minorities and other people.  They want a tribute to the American Indians.  They want a diversity sensitivity center toward the Muslims.  That's what they want down there.  And we have to entertain these people.  Instead of shoving their face in whatever fountain is down there and drowning them.  Drown them.  But no, we've got to entertain it so with all that bullcrap going on, they're sitting in front of a ditch instead of in front of a great construction site where today... 
[00:22:30]  A tribute today would be to watch steel workers putting up I-beams for a new trade center.  That would be a tribute.  That would be happy.  The news people could go, hey, let's pan up and watch them working.  Look at the American flag flying above.  They're 40 stories up already.  Something!  But no, they've got to sit in front of a ditch the same way it was five and a half or four and a half years ago at this point after the cleanup with nothing. 
[00:23:00]  Nothing there.  Because we're a bunch of sheep.  We're a bunch of idiots.  We sit here and we've got to listen to every little stupid group instead of just taking the bull by the balls and doing something.  Let's listen to the Muslims.  They're with the sensitivity.  Oh, we've got to put a museum here that's the sensitivity so this never happens again.  No.  No, we don't.  Just build something for God's sake.  All right, we've got to take a break. 
[00:23:30]  No!  Oh.  Coming up, we have a squirrel.  Angry at everything.  Coming up, we have a squirrel that water skis.  I love the water skiing squirrel.  He's so cute.  What?  Oh, none of those stories today?  How did they teach him to do it?  Do we have the boxer dog that skateboards?  How did they teach him to push it?  I guess we'll have none of those cute pieces on the news today, right?  No cute pieces today.  Oh, we get you.  We know what you're doing today.  No fluff pieces, right?  You should see this.  The news director told everyone no fluff pieces today.  No fluff. 
[00:24:00]  All morbid.  I did a special piece, by the way, on what you can get your dog to do with some peanut butter.  We'll be showing later in the week.  That's a nice piece.  A fluff piece.  No fluff pieces.  No grandmas graduating college 60 years too late.  Don't see that.  None of that crap today, right, news?  We're on.  We're on to you.  Here is a tribute being done on a beach.  But make sure you get all your commercials done.  On a beach out on Long Island.  Point lookout.  Well, because that's a lot of people went to that beach. 
[00:24:30]  Did they?  Yeah, because they could see the towers from there.  They made two crystal towers on what amount to a sandcastle with chairs in front of it.  And they're going to do something there because every little place, every little place has  to put their own little spin on this.  Oh, there you go.  So that's what we're doing today on our show.  How do you like them apples?  Can we please get audio?  Enough with what are you guys going to do today? 
[00:25:00]  This is what we do.  Can we please get audio of how the gay guys, how they handled it?  I'd love to know how they handled it differently than anybody else.  I want to know what station is that because I need tape of that.  How did they handle it?  I'm sure it affected homosexuals in a much different way.  It's at 11 a.m. on, oh, it's on WBAI, 99.5.  All right.  Roll tape.  Roll tape.  It's a show called Out FM.  Talks about gays involved in September 11th.  A lot of, probably a lot of mistaken things happen. 
[00:25:30]  That's probably the difference.  Like the one guy would look at the other guy and go, I know, it's so sad.  Wipe those tears off your face.  He'd go, oops, those aren't tears.  Oops.  Oops.  Enough already.  Your sexuality had nothing to do with it.  Nothing.  Why put that twist on it?  I don't know.  Meanwhile, if you said we don't think it affected gay people the same way, they'd scream.  They'd scream anyway.  But, I mean, they would yell.  Yeah.  Hey, do we have the cockroach weatherman?  What is that, a segue? 
[00:26:00]  Well, keep the laughs coming.  Yes.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, we'll go to your phone calls next.  You got a war face?  What the F?  Ah!  That's a war face.  Now let me see your war face.  Oh!  F*** you didn't convince me.  Let me see your real war face.  No!  You don't scare me.  Work on it.  Jackass.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I'm scared. 
[00:26:30]  Go!  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number is 1-866-313-FREE.  1-866-313-FREE.  We understand, by the way, the news has to do something today.  We understand that papers have to write about it.  We get it to a point. 
[00:27:00]  To a point.  Let's say hi to Dan in New Jersey.  Dan, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  I'm the blind kid again.  I just wanted to tell you what Z100 is doing this morning.  Z100?  Yes.  They are sending their stunt guy out with over 500 little flags and giving them out to commuters.  Oh, great.  So they could drive around with flags on their car again like we did five years ago?  Yep.  Know what was great about that?  By October 1st, you saw so many flags on the gutters on the highways around New York City. 
[00:27:30]  But no one talked about that.  Oh, everyone was patriotic.  They had their flags all over their cars.  Yep.  And then those things would fall off.  And where do they end up?  In gutters all over the highways.  Yep.  In the New York area.  Don't say, yep, you're blind.  You didn't see it.  Yeah, you just heard.  Jesus.  What a point.  How did the blind deal with 9-11, sir?  Can we get your reflections?  Were you truly affected if you never saw the buildings?  Were you as shocked as we were as you sat there facing the TV but actually looking at 
[00:28:00]  the lamp?  Oh, that's horrible.  And you have to take our word for it that it happened.  How much does that suck?  Yeah.  Oh, man.  This could be just a clever ruse of ruse.  All right, Dan.  Thank you.  Well, Z100 doing the right thing, of course, on this sad day.  Because anything you can do as a publicity stunt.  Right.  By having your stunt guy give out things.  Anything that has the 9-11 thing. 
[00:28:30]  If you give out 9-11 somethings.  If you really care about patriotism, why didn't you give the flags away on August 1st?  Yep.  August 8th.  July 4th.  July 4th.  There you go.  That would make sense.  Even a tie-in.  There's a tie-in for you.  No, let's wait until September 11th.  Make sure there's the Z100 logo on it.  Z100 is passing out all these flags for no reason.  Why are we so selective?  Thank you, David.  And again, of course, 9-11 was awful.  I mean, you have to mention it. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Why are we so selective what we choose to deal with this morbidly?  Like, when you look at the tsunami, I mean, which doesn't bring out anger and hatred like 9-11 does.  200,000 people died.  Yeah, a quarter million people dead.  I mean, that's a lot of people.  And the media brushes over it.  Yeah, you know, this is where they are now.  30 seconds later, they're done.  Why?  Because people aren't going to watch the whole episode.  Because it's far away and we don't care.  Right.  And that's just the way it is.  And me, personally, I don't care. 
[00:29:30]  I don't care.  When they show, like, the tsunami thing, it's so distant to me that I really don't care.  9-11, very close to me.  And I do care.  A lot.  I don't need the constant friggin' visual and audio reminders of the whole thing.  There you go.  That's nice.  Now I got to look at that.  That's wonderful.  They finally have an excuse to show this footage again.  There is not one image.  Oh, they've been dying to show this footage.  Not one image they can show that is not etched in my head. 
[00:30:00]  Not one friggin'.  Come up with one new image that I could go, wow, I ain't seen that.  It is etched in my brain and will stay there till I drop dead.  It will never go away.  I don't need to see it.  I don't need the morbid music behind it.  That's it.  Stop it already.  Let's go to Jeff in Kentucky.  Jeff, what's up?  Hey, guys.  When are people going to wake up?  These stupid, stinking bastards are celebrating right underneath our nose by having a Muslim 
[00:30:30]  Day parade yesterday.  Isn't it kind of ironic that a former Iranian president comes to the country on the weekend  and there's two big old United Arab Emirates jetliners sitting at the Lexington airport.  They're effing celebrating and nobody's doing a damn thing about it.  I mean, believe me, I hate to play devil's advocate, but there really isn't much you can  do to tell people not to march.  What are you going to do?  Hey, how about telling them to march on January 20th? 
[00:31:00]  When it's freezing cold out or someday that's a little further away from September 11th and  September 10th to know, was it at all attributed during the march?  I sincerely doubt it, but I could be wrong.  Maybe was it at all?  It's just a little weird that day before September 11th, though.  Did somebody get up and maybe give a speech saying how horrible these Muslim extremists are  and perhaps, yeah, to knock it off and a little tolerance? 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, something like that.  Did that happen or did they just run around going in their garb and hate America?  Right after they arrest all these guys ready to bring water bombs or whatever they were  ready to do in England, England has their first Miss England or whatever it was, a Muslim  girl.  I guess, again, they're the worst England.  They just don't.  Oh, the guilt over there.  They're just the guiltiest colonizing white people.  When you colonize half the world for most of the time and then they push you back to one  little island, it's just guilt. 
[00:32:00]  So what does she do?  She gets up and she starts saying how it's racial profiling that causes terrorism.  Like, blaming the root cause is, again, on the victims of terrorism and not on the people  who are committing the terrorist acts.  And she's like 18 or 19.  It just doesn't end.  We're doomed.  All right, let's say...  Doomed if we can stay on this road.  Let's say hi to Dawn in PA.  Dawn, what's up?  Hey, man, what's up?  Hey.  You guys suck.  You were great in Camden.  And I don't even have a voice left.  Oh, yeah.  We're going to talk about that a little later this morning.  Bill Burr coming in.  Holy crap. 
[00:32:30]  If you haven't heard what happened to Bill Burr yet, stick around.  But go ahead, Dawn.  Howard's selling his 9-11 audio and video on his pay-per-view television show, Howard TV.  Yeah, Howard sells everything.  Eventually, he'll be selling his poo.  That's all I got for you.  Are you kidding?  I heard this, too.  Yeah, he's selling his 9-11 show.  Wait, now, is it in a block of other shows, or is he just selling it as a 9-11 show? 
[00:33:00]  No, I guess a couple shows that never aired, and now they're special.  So instead of just giving it to the people, he's selling it to make even more money,  because I guess he doesn't have enough money.  Eventually, he'll be selling his poo.  What is that one?  All right, thank you, Dawn.  All right, man.  Here we go.  Here's a news tease about what they're going to do next in honor of the five-year anniversary here.  And our coverage here continues this morning.  When we come back, we'll take you to Middletown, New Jersey. 
[00:33:30]  A town that lost so much, but they are healing five years after 9-11.  What did Middletown lose?  I don't know.  You've got to stick around.  Maybe a lot of people.  Well, we've got the story, and of course, they got Long and Winding Road by the Beatles.  Great.  To play behind the story.  It's got to be sad.  Our coverage of the September 11th attacks continues.  And one of the many things that people remember about the tragedy is all of those makeshift memorials  and the faces of the victims that found these plastered all over the city as they desperately searched for loved ones. 
[00:34:00]  Dick?  Yeah.  Well, Karen, it's actually pretty amazing.  Many of those walls with the faces of the missing have been preserved by some really dedicated people  who want to save them for history.  The long and winding road.  Every picture told an agonizing story.  In the days following 9-11, it was the longing for the missing at the so-called whaling walls.  I just don't get it. 
[00:34:30]  Why do we, as a people, have to be in this deep sorrow?  Why do we do this to ourselves?  Funerals.  I was going to say.  The whole thing.  I'm talking about everything.  We preserve these little moments of pure effing agony just to relive over and over again. 
[00:35:00]  Why is that?  I don't get it, man.  When my dad died, it was three days of walking around in a state.  Yeah.  And, you know, the next tribute was just worse than the one prior.  And you just, you do everything possible to try to be as sad as humanly possible.  Why?  Why do we do that as a society?  Why do we do that as human beings?  I don't get it.  I'm one of the, I had a few people really close to me die, you know, during the time we were off the radio, whatever. 
[00:35:30]  And I just didn't get it.  I didn't want to go through all this crap.  If it was up to me, I would have just went off on my own and dealt with the death of a close family member on my own.  But you get dragged into the, you know, the mob mentality of what's going on.  And you just walk around in a zombie state for three, four days. 
[00:36:00]  And everything is just all out sadness.  And that's what they're doing today.  That's what the news is doing today.  This collective sorrow that they just want to push on everybody.  For days, they're only thankful.  No, it's okay.  I thought they were going to have more of the music.  It's like, what channel, which station can make you more sad?  And that's what they're going for today.  Wait a minute.  Okay.  Fox is really sad today, guys. 
[00:36:30]  Come on.  Snap it up.  Start pulling better music.  Right.  All right.  No, Fox, I saw a woman watching crying.  Now, we got to step it up here at CNN and really get some sad music and images.  Come on.  Move it.  Move it, people.  We got sorrow to put out there.  And then the anchormen and women, they allow themselves one of those smiles that, like, half-hearted.  The sad smile.  No, no.  They're kind of trying to give you a little smile. 
[00:37:00]  Like they've moved on.  Like it's okay.  It's okay.  We'll get through this.  Stop.  Cry for the day.  For days, there were only faint hopes, soon to be replaced by overwhelming grief and the  awful realization that their loved ones would be missing forever.  In the days and weeks following 9-11, family members gathered here at Pier 94, and pretty  soon murals began popping up all around here. 
[00:37:30]  Now, years later, all those murals may be gone.  Believe it or not, they're not gone forever.  The walls did not come down.  They were preserved and recreated here at Pier 94.  They were filled with words of love for a mom taken too soon for a dad who never came home.  God, they just are trying so hard.  And I like the McCartney music there behind it.  Someone call Yoko.  Isn't that wonderful? 
[00:38:00]  Her Beatle music's being used.  As his wife's leg collapsed.  If they really want to make us feel better on a day like this, instead of covering these  chicks up, how about you make them sit in the studio and do the news topless?  Yeah, there you go.  Like they should be doing anyway.  That's the only reason they're allowed to talk on television.  They didn't whore them up today.  Why are there not a lot?  By the way, if the news is so sincere, why are there not a lot of big fat pigs delivering  the news?  How come there's not a lot of them?  Because they know no one would watch.  Big fat women.  Why are there not a lot of big fat women?  Not a lot would watch. 
[00:38:30]  I can't believe any.  No one would watch.  Occasionally, maybe an Ira Jo or an Al Roker or a fun-filled fat jovial fat fellow.  Jolly fat guy, but never a fat woman.  Why not?  Because she would be unpleasant to watch and no one would watch her.  I mean, I respect them for not doing that because I don't want to look at a big fat  woman.  But they could never say that on the air.  They could never say that.  Let's go to Ian on Long Island.  Ian.  Yeah, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Long time. 
[00:39:00]  I just started listening to you guys not too long ago when I started getting in the  car, going to, uh, driving all around the whole Northeast.  After you guys are back on the air.  Who gives a crap?  What do you got to say today?  Hey.  Don't screw with us.  The BS about this 9-11 crap needs to get over with.  It happened five years ago.  The way we should celebrate is bomb the bastards and find a seven-foot idiot attached to an insulin  machine and beat the living hell out of him.  That's how we should celebrate today.  He beat him up?  Jesus, sir.  Don't be so harsh with your punishments. 
[00:39:30]  Wow.  We should give his knuckles a good wrapping.  I'll punch him in the old bread basket.  Yeah, we ought to catch bin Laden and give him a knuckle sandwich.  No, we should capture him, put him up in the middle of New York and everybody kick him  in the nuts once.  Coming up on the program, we're going to be taking your phone calls.  What would you do to bin Laden if we captured him?  Remember that old gag?  Kick him in the groin, but there's eight million New Yorkers.  Do you know how long that line would be?  Oh my God, forget about it.  And if he didn't do it, he would be, there's no way he'd live through that.  No.  It's just not a feasible punishment.  No. 
[00:40:00]  A few people and then it would be over and the people would wait and we'd be like, hey,  I've been standing in line.  The news would cover it.  I get nothing.  He'd be there and they'd be like, ah, the testicle kicking is continuing.  It's been going on for eight days now.  Sure, that's not a good idea.  Yeah.  Let's go to Nick in Colorado.  Nick.  Yeah, I agree too.  Nick.  He said.  Up.  Nick.  Up.  I like his tone though.  Yeah.  He was upbeat.  All right.  Well, we'll move on.  We've got plenty of phone calls today.  John on Long Island, what's up? 
[00:40:30]  Hey, what's up?  I've got one for you.  Hey there, Jim.  What's going on, guys?  I have a son and they're making him call his family members, his school teacher, and write  a report about how horrible the experience was on 9-11.  Yeah, there you go.  This is what I don't like the media is not addressing.  Where are they?  Where's the anger that they're not addressing?  We are sorrow.  Yes, it was horribly said.  Yes, we agree.  Yeah.  Where's the anger and the rage that it brought out?  They're pissed.  You know who's pissed? 
[00:41:00]  This room is pissed.  Yeah.  The only annoyed people I've seen so far is sitting in this room with me, an annoyed  person, a pissed off person.  Oh, I'm not going to sit there and weep and we got to remember this is a sorrowful thing.  Remember it with anger.  Let's go to Rick in New Jersey.  Rick.  Dude, good morning.  Good morning.  You know, it's funny that you just said that about the anger because it's taken every bit 
[00:41:30]  of me not to drive my car into a newsroom window or into a mosque doorway.  What I find the most disgusting and the most egregious is that the news people, they look  at it as a two-day rating celebration and then you don't hear a damn thing until a year  later.  They just did it with Katrina.  They do it now every year with this.  You get two days of this pure sad crap thing. 
[00:42:00]  You don't see one good story on how families are moving on or how angry a regular construction  worker driving to work at 6 a.m. that has to sit and swallow this crap all day, every  day, all year, so angry I can hardly speak.  Don't drive into a newsroom though, sir.  Don't drive through a newsroom door.  If you're going to crash into a building, make it a Rite Aid and get some Afrin.  You sound a bit congested.  I'm suffering from a cold. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  But you know, you still got to go to work.  You certainly do.  And in answer to the guy beating up Bin Laden, if I had him, I swear I'd rip his heart right  out of his chest and eat it for breakfast.  Everyone would.  Maybe the onion in the blood would help my flu.  How would you wash down the heart though?  Would you go with a beer in the morning?  Would you chew it or cut it up?  Would you have it with your morning coffee?  No.  No drinking for me.  Cooked?  You eat breakfast.  Wait, you wouldn't drink anything.  You would just eat the heart.  At dinner.  You would just eat the heart with no liquid. 
[00:43:00]  Don't need a lick.  Don't need a beer.  Don't need nothing.  Just a heart sliced up nice or maybe a piece of pumpernickel bread.  And enjoy it for the rest of the day.  Well, sir, you have to realize breakfast is the most important meal.  And I wouldn't suggest you be glib about it and have a heart.  Right.  Perhaps a brunch.  I would cut out his heart and I'd eat it for brunch.  With a mimosa.  You guys make my day.  And no, I'm not looking at the stuff.  I think I would have to have some egg whites.  No.  Like maybe make some kind of omelet out of it. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  It's got to be mixed with something.  Just a little bit.  You can't just eat pure Bin Laden heart.  Yeah.  Maybe a little cheese on top.  Mix it up.  I'd put his heart out and I'd have a fondue with it.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Put in your Osama Bin Laden heart.  A little sugar.  Some wine.  All right.  And that's my trick.  We're on to something today, by the way.  There's nothing but positive calls on this.  We didn't know what kind of reaction we were going to get to this.  Yeah.  But, I mean, last night sitting around watching the TV, I was like, why are we doing this? 
[00:44:00]  People are miserable.  Disgusted.  I'm angry.  That's all I am.  Angry piss.  And once again, I get it.  You've got to acknowledge it.  You've got to do some things.  Yeah, of course.  But the over-the-top, just the, you know, all-day-long crap.  And he made a great point.  Two days.  That's what you get.  Maybe three.  And then it tapers off and then you don't hear about it again.  And then he gets squirrel water skiing again.  Squirrel water skiing.  I'll be back by Wednesday.  Which, by the way, is adorable.  Do you ever see him?  Yeah.  He's on the little thing and he's holding on.  He's a squirrel.  And even in a turn, he's a squirrel. 
[00:44:30]  And, God damn it, he's water skiing.  Oh, it is cute as a bug's ear.  You should see when they zoom in, though, and you see his little squirrel feet nailed  to the water skis.  All right.  Here's someone that disagrees.  Tim in Massachusetts.  All right.  Tim.  Hello.  Hey, Tim.  Hey, Tim.  How's it going?  All right, Tim.  I just got to say, I don't think it's wrong for people to remember what happened, you  know, five years ago.  Okay.  No, we agree with that much.  We agree.  Definitely.  And remember the tragedy that happened, you know, the losses that people took.  It was so sudden and so surprising, you know. 
[00:45:00]  Tim, we understand that.  It was only five years ago.  It's not like it was, you know, 40 years ago.  We're on the same page there.  We're on the same page.  The problem we have is this over morbid coverage that the news does that is completely unnecessary.  It's this thing that we all have, not all of us, but most of this country has, that we  need to get together in this morbid sorrow. 
[00:45:30]  I mean, what is that?  Why can't we remember it for what it is, an attack on the country?  Remember that there were a lot of people lost and a lot of loved ones left without the  people they loved.  And, you know, deal with it that way.  A lot of times I got to say, you know, news stations, they do things for ratings or whatever,  but I don't think it's wrong to do anything possible to conjure up feelings and sadness  that people felt so long ago.  Why, Tim?  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.  Do you like conjure up the sadness?  Why conjure up sadness? 
[00:46:00]  Because it helps you remember people that you loved.  We remember, that's what we're trying to tell you.  Let me tell you something, though.  We don't need help remembering from the media, dude.  And here's another thing.  Hey, I don't think if you guys can't join in on the remorse and the sadness that people  felt long ago and they want to relive it, I think you guys should just drop him.  They want to relive it?  Why?  Why?  Why relive it?  God almighty, they want to relive it.  He hangs up.  And sit home alone and relive it.  The victims' families are mourning today, believe me. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  They probably mourn every day.  I'll be honest with you.  I didn't have any loved ones over there.  He said, you know, to get together with the people, the loved ones you lost, I didn't lose  any loved ones.  I feel absolutely horrible for the people that did.  Of course.  But why would you want to get together with others?  I'm not.  I don't.  The anniversary of my dad's death.  You know what I did?  I spent the day alone, by myself, that I didn't want to get together with other family members 
[00:47:00]  or get on the phone and be sadder than I already was.  Because that's all it would do, is make you more sad.  You're sad enough.  I want to be by myself.  That's how I feel.  Sad enough.  Grieving is one thing, but letting the media, like saying the media bringing this stuff,  why do you need them to brag out memories?  Don't you have your own feelings about it?  Do you need sad music and this nonsense of them all wearing black suits and covering  the breasts like that's what Dixie really is?  They've been brainwashed.  The guy right there that you just heard was effing brainwashed by the media who tells you 
[00:47:30]  that you have to do this.  This is something five years later.  We've got to get together now and be all sorrow and sad.  No, we don't.  Why sell advertising then?  Remember.  Remember where it came from.  Don't ever forget that.  Extremist animals.  They'll have their hair down tomorrow and they'll be out of their dark suits.  Back with their cans just hanging out, talking about celebrities and who's banging who. 
[00:48:00]  I just saw on Channel 7 they're doing a tribute and right before they came back in on the  news, a commercial for the Tarzan musical.  Well.  Or whatever it was.  At least it was important.  Yeah.  Why sell your advertising?  Oh, sorry.  I had something.  Yeah.  Hold on a minute here.  Today, we turn to lower Manhattan for a day of tribute and honor.  Five years have passed, but for many, the pain and memories are as real as yesterday.  Be with us as we remember those that were lost and the struggles of their loved ones. 
[00:48:30]  9-11.  A remembrance today.  Bill, can you do that again?  It wasn't sad enough.  We needed to be a little more somber.  You almost had it on that tape, but let's give it another try, okay?  In three, two, one.  Holy crap.  As we join.  Yeah.  Let's get the voice down to this level.  Mention.  There's the voice you use when you have to say something sad.  Mention the anger. 
[00:49:00]  None of them will acknowledge the rage this brought out of people.  You know something?  On September 11th, five years ago, how many people were sad at the moment it happened,  watching on television, and how many people were livid pissed?  You knew exactly when it happened.  You knew exactly who did it.  Of course you did.  You didn't know the exact names of the individuals.  You knew exactly why it was done.  You knew it was radical as well. 
[00:49:30]  You knew exactly what it was.  It was the same people that tried to do it in 93 is what it was.  So you knew that, and as it happened, did everyone go, oh, my God, I'm feeling so somber  right now that the buildings are on fire and people have to lead to their deaths, and this  is an awful thing.  I was sitting there going, mother, I couldn't curse enough at the savages that had done this  to our country, and none of that gets brought up.  It's all about wreath-laying and sorrow and remembrance.  Not one person is bringing up the animal, psychopathic, extremist, Muslim, dirt, dirt, crap that did 
[00:50:00]  this.  Bring it up!  Talk about that!  Where's your anger, you faggots?  Come on!  Nothing.  Nope.  We gotta be sensitive to the diversity.  They just won't mention the rage of Broodaly.  No.  If you want to mention the sadness, fine, but mention the real emotion that most people  felt when associated with that. 
[00:50:30]  Anger.  Anger.  The want and need to rip someone's head off is what we were feeling five years ago.  Not this sorrow.  That came later.  Jackass, phony bastards on the news.  After the break, we'll...  Yes, yes, Greg.  When we come back.  I want to call you Greg.  Opie is a little too jovial.  We're going to look at all the jewelry that was found at Ground Zero.  Yes, yes, yes.  That should make a lot of people sad.  Jesus Christ.  I want to know how... 
[00:51:00]  Broken wedding rings.  Combs.  Saw that on the news before.  Hunks of melted metal.  This was an actual plate from the number 34 from the elevator.  They held that up on the news before as a little memento from the 34th.  You think we're kidding?  Listen to the crap they're doing, news tease-wise.  Pulling it out.  And thank you for that.  And we are continuing this morning to cover some very personal stories of loss and triumph.  Up next, a man who lost his wife on 9-11 tells us about his journey back from heartache. 
[00:51:30]  Fox actually has 9-11-06.  The 11 is Twin Towers.  Yeah, yeah, they had to make a cute little graphic using the Towers as the number 11.  Why?  All right, why don't we...  I'm disgusted.  I'm truly disgusted.  They're showing...  I don't know what channel that is.  Oh, they're all revving up now, man. 
[00:52:00]  We have, what, one, two, three, four TVs in this studio, and it's just...  You don't even know where to look.  You don't even know where to look at this point.  Oh, NBC, yeah, I'm just watching the Towers on Fire and crap flying out of them.  There you go.  There's people crying.  And crying and tears and...  Oh, yeah, there's...  There's tombstones.  Oh, there's a montage of everyone that was lost in the shape of an American flag.  That's wonderful.  Give me a Valium.  Had it.  It's the only virus spreading across America. 
[00:52:30]  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello?  Hi, Ma.  Ma, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Welcome to the Opie...  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back.  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Finally.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:53:00]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's say hi to Jimbo in Connecticut.  Jimbo, what's up?  Well, I think in the spirit of moving on, you know, I'm heading back to work.  You guys obviously are at work.  I'm dying to hear how the Philly show went.  For the ONA traveling virus?  That's right.  Did they keep the momentum going?  Did those guys continue the momentum?  What's happening?  Who bombed?  Who killed? 
[00:53:30]  What's up?  All right, yeah, let's get into it a little bit.  By the way, a lot of pictures going up on opiananthony.com right now from the ONA traveling virus at the  Twitter Center in Camden, New Jersey.  Some people are taking some video.  Yeah.  That's up on YouTube.  And, uh...  Wow.  It was definitely a success.  A lot of people.  Well, we expected a rowdy crowd.  Philly's known for that.  We expected that.  It was a little different than the PNC Arts Center show.  Just a bit.  Getting rave reviews, by the way.  We did over 10,000 people at the Twitter Center. 
[00:54:00]  And, um...  Man, where do we begin?  Where do we begin?  I know I ran back to our dressing room, and I don't really drink during these things,  because I'm a nervous Nelly backstage.  I want to make sure everything is going to run smoothly.  But when Jimmy Schubert was getting booed, from the moment he pretty much started telling his jokes,  I ran into the dressing room and did a big shot of vanilla Stoli vodka or something. 
[00:54:30]  Because I was like, oh, my God, this could be a disaster.  This could be a disaster.  The show started with Rich Voss.  Voss went out.  And he absolutely killed.  Yeah.  It was his best performance on the Onei Traveling Virus.  And then he introduced the first comedian, Jimmy Schubert, who's a funny guy.  Yeah.  And, uh, they just hated him.  We've got to be honest.  They hated him.  Unbelievable.  They started booing.  Vicious.  And he never acknowledged the crowd, so they booed louder and louder, 
[00:55:00]  and he tried to just plow through his set.  Did he go all the way to the end, Jimmy?  I don't know how much time he did.  On the monitor I was watching in the dressing room, there was a direct feed through the microphone,  so it was hard to tell how anybody was doing.  You couldn't hear.  You couldn't hear the audience.  Right.  I watched from the dressing room.  You couldn't hear the audience booing, but he seemed thrown.  And then it ended, and I was like, wow, that ending was really awkward.  Well, I walked.  He kind of just left.  I walked out and stood on the side of the stage.  Oh, you did.  I saw something.  It was like he was sweating, and he was like, there was something.  Oh, no.  You could see something was uncomfortable. 
[00:55:30]  Uh, his sweater.  Well, yeah, that was, I would say to Jimmy, that was probably a weird choice.  Dressed like paint swatches.  Um, but then I went out and tried the game.  Dressed like he was doing a gig in the Catskill.  Jimmy, Jesus.  It was, uh.  We got to update your wardrobe there.  It was, it was, uh, it was loud.  It was loud, man.  The booing was so loud that you couldn't hear Jimmy Schubert anymore.  He never acknowledged the crowd, which I think was a huge mistake.  And, um, he just tried to plow through his material anyway.  It doesn't work. 
[00:56:00]  It just didn't work.  The booing got louder.  Uh, and I really thought a vanilla Stoli, did that drink come with complimentary aids?  It was, Bill, it was, Bill, it was the, it was the only thing I could find backstage.  I didn't bring it to the venue.  Complimentary aids.  It's like, hey, you know what I brought to the venue or asked for?  Coffee.  I just wanted coffee.  That's all.  But after Jimmy Schubert, I'm like, oh my God, is this a sign of things to come tonight?  Uh, thank God it wasn't.  Everyone down there in general had a really, really good time.  And just about all the comedians did very, very, very well at the, uh, the tweeter center 
[00:56:30]  in Camden.  And then, um, and then Bill Burr hit the stage.  What happened with Bill Burr to start the whole thing?  Well, I mean, uh.  The crowd had been a little antsy throughout the show.  I mean, they had been a little bit, I mean, against Philadelphia, they're animals.  A few of the other comics went up after, um, the, uh, disaster.  Because Jimmy was second.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who went up first?  It was Voss and then Jimmy Schubert. 
[00:57:00]  All right, Voss, Schubert.  Voss, Jimmy, Tracy Morgan went on.  And then Tracy went on, right.  Tracy did a great job.  He brought him back.  He brought the crowd back.  And then, uh.  Ralphie May, I want to say.  Ralphie May went on.  And that's why we love Philly, because they are animals, but they also, you know, you  know, respect what we do.  If we're trying really hard, they're going to give us love.  But with something with Jimmy Schubert that, it just didn't click.  I think that, here's the problem with Jimmy, they just didn't know him from the show.  They were here.  You know what I mean?  It's like, any, any, any, like, if any, any, most of us have a joke missed, they 
[00:57:30]  weren't going to bully you if a joke missed.  But when they don't know you from the show, I mean, they really didn't know Jimmy, because  he hadn't been on in a long time.  They just jumped on him.  So Tracy went on, then Ralphie May did well, and then, uh, I think it was Patrice after  Ralphie.  And then I want to say it was, uh, was it Saget after, or no, I'm missing somebody.  Well, I don't know.  Yeah, Saget went on, did a great job.  He killed.  Patrice did great.  And then, uh, let's see.  We had a Bob Kelly.  Bobby came out. 
[00:58:00]  After the break, it was Bob Kelly.  Bob killed.  Uh, killed.  Dom Herrera.  Who, uh, they were booing Dom a little bit, which I was really surprised at.  That's weird.  Dom is really funny.  I was surprised.  Uh, I, I just was like, I've never.  He's been doing it forever.  He's, he's a seasoned, uh, comic.  He handled it.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, but he handled it.  He, he left early too.  Yeah.  He handled it.  We had none of this at the PNC, by the way.  No booing whatsoever.  That's why I was like, wow, what is going on here?  And he's another one, though, that just kept going, like, through his act.  They didn't boo him, uh, as bad as they booed Schubert, but, you know, there was some booze 
[00:58:30]  and he just went through and did his act.  And then after him, uh, Bill Burr went on.  Bill Burr goes on, does one joke.  One or two.  It was a bit, right?  The Hitler bit.  The second he went out, he goes into, like, the first bit and they start booing.  They start booing.  And Bill just turned it around.  He acknowledged the booze.  Jimmy Schubert did not.  Bill Burr did.  And he went off for 15 minutes on how much Philly stinks in his mind. 
[00:59:00]  In his mind, by the way.  And ripped apart the audience, Philly, every Philadelphia institution.  Ben Franklin, the Liberty Bells, the Phillies, the Eagles, the city itself, the Betsy Ross  Bridge, the audience, I mean, the fact that they hate blacks.  I mean, he just went nuts.  Oh, did he go off.  And every minute, because there was a little teleprompter in front of the stage that showed 
[00:59:30]  the comedian how much time they had left.  So he's like, I got 11 minutes.  And boom, he'd pound, pound, pound, pound, pound.  Nine more minutes.  You're not getting rid of me.  Boom, boom, boom.  And just lambasted this audience.  He handled it.  I couldn't believe they were starting to boo Bill.  I was like, why would they boo Bill?  Yeah, why are you booing Bill?  Why?  You guys love Bill.  You guys hysterical.  I think the people booing were probably, my theory on why, because Pete Patrice got a couple 
[01:00:00]  of boos.  And guys love Patrice.  I think a lot of them that were booing were free FM people who don't know Billy and Patrice  as well from the show, because those guys are huge parts of the show.  You know, the listeners love those guys.  Nobody would boo them.  And I think they had so much fun getting Schubert in the position he got in that they wanted  to do it again.  Well, Philly does this for sport.  Yeah.  Yeah.  When they get together, they do this type of thing.  Everyone knows that.  Well.  You know, the stories are legendary about booing Santa Claus. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, there's a million.  They love to boo.  A million examples of Philly just getting really obnoxious.  Philly wasn't having any part of it, man, and just turned it around to where when he  got done, the place gave him such an ovation and applauded him for putting up with his  crap.  During the set.  Like, he was like, they were booing.  A lot of them were booing.  And then he would be just smashing them so brutally that he was getting big laughs during 
[01:01:00]  the set.  He was getting laughed as he was bashing them for being booed.  And that's why I love Philly crowds, because at that point, they had to start laughing.  Yeah.  They respected what Bill Burr was doing up there.  Bill Burr showed the biggest balls I've probably ever seen on a stage.  And by the end of it, they're applauding like, holy crap, I can't believe what you just  did.  Yeah.  And then Bill goes, you know what?  I still hate you guys.  Because I don't care how this is going now.  I still hate you.  Instead of acknowledging that, you know.  And I'm looking at pictures. 
[01:01:30]  E-Rock's throwing a ton of pictures up on opianathlete.com.  Are these pictures of Bill Burr, the audience, when Bill Burr, God, there's a picture here  that's great.  You got people standing up applauding Bill Burr, and then a guy leaning all the way back  so his boo could be heard.  All in one shot.  Look at that shot.  That's a great shot.  What an ass.  And Bill, like at the end of the whole thing, they're applauding him.  And what the hell did he say?  He goes, hey, thanks a lot.  You were here.  You were here.  Blam.  And as this was going on, the buzz backstage was unbelievable. 
[01:02:00]  Because, you know, everyone's running around doing their own thing.  And then the word spread that they're booing Bill Burr.  And we're like, that's impossible.  So everyone started running to the stage, side stage.  All the comedians, everyone backstage, just jumping up and down, laughing, hitting each other,  falling on the ground.  We couldn't believe what we were watching.  Could not believe it.  It was great.  I was really loving, loving him.  Yeah.  Watching him do that.  Especially since I had to go on next.  And the fact that he was getting them back. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah.  I've never wanted to kiss Bill Burr on the mouth until I saw it when he walked off stage.  Was it last time I had the Twitter show?  It took their booing power away.  Right.  It really did.  It ruined it.  Like, if they wanted to boo you or anyone else that hit that stage, it took all the wind  out of their sails.  And the word is spreading.  Everyone's finding out about this this morning.  It's on YouTube.  There's a bootleg copy of this already.  It's up on YouTube.  You throw Opie and Anthony in the search, and you can see it for yourself.  It's already been downloaded a lot, and it's not even linked anywhere. 
[01:03:00]  We haven't even talked about it yet.  It's just word of mouth is spreading already about Bill Burr's set at the Tweeter Center  in Camden two nights ago.  Unbelievable.  There's going to be a lot of footage, I think, backstage footage on MySpace.  They covered this really well.  Yeah.  A lot of footage of us at the signing and all this stuff.  So MySpace is going to be doing something with it hopefully today or tomorrow.  Sugar was hosting that, by the way.  Oh, was he really?  Yeah, he was doing the interviews and everything.  He hosted for MySpace.  Okay.  Mike in Philly, what's up? 
[01:03:30]  Hey, man.  How you guys doing?  Hey.  You know, the show rocked, man.  But I'll tell you what, it was an embarrassing beat from PA.  Don Marrera came on, and they booed Don Marrera.  And at that point, there was like a whole row of us that just got up and rolled.  It was just, you know, the $10 seats they drank all day, and it was just unbelievable, man.  Yeah, it was late in the show, too.  Yeah.  So everyone's concentration was kind of like, you know, fading here and there.  Someone is saying, oh, where'd it go? 
[01:04:00]  Thanks, man.  King Taco from Philly.  Honestly, Billy's first bit about Hitler didn't kill.  The second a comic didn't get a huge laugh for a bit, the booing started.  Yeah, but no, my point is this with the bit.  The bit didn't kill, but so what?  People like Billy enough to let a bit not kill.  Not every one of my bits killed.  Not every one of a boss's bits.  You know what I mean?  It's like crowds are not that primitive when they already like you.  You know, they love Bill.  Bill is really – people on this – listen to this show love Bill Burr.  He's hilarious. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  So I think anyone that started probably booing him would probably be people that really have only heard him a couple of times on Free FM so far.  Yeah, let's say hi to somebody else from Philly.  I don't know your name, bro.  What's up?  Hey, buddy, you.  Come on.  I'm talking to you, yeah.  When Bill Burr first came out, the reason the booing started, he made an off-the-cuff comment about Don Marrera's set.  And that just built the momentum, and everybody just – but he handled it great.  It was the funniest 15 minutes.  By the way, they started booing Dom a little bit, so I think Bill Burr acknowledged that. 
[01:05:00]  Is that what you're saying?  Yes.  Oh, okay.  When Bill first walked out, he made a comment about, oh, something about Dom, and then the front four or five rows just started booing, and the momentum built.  But he handled it beautifully.  He was hysterical.  And I hope people understand.  You know, comedians go up there.  They don't improv for the most part.  I mean, you throw a few things in there, obviously.  Bill Burr made all that up off-the-cuff in front of 10,000 people that were booing him. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  You know, you understand what kind of balls that takes?  Just – it was just anger.  And what a great knowledge of Philadelphia he has.  Jesus Christ.  He was pulling out all kinds of, like, Philly institutions and just trash, you know.  I'm glad that mayor in 1927 died.  Yeah, yeah.  I know.  Bill knows a lot about Philly.  He certainly does, damn reader.  Some of the highlights was F the Liberty Bell. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember some of the other ones.  What was the other one?  I hope Dominic McNabb breaks both his ankles.  And they go 0-16.  Eagles won yesterday, by the way.  The Rocky crap was great.  I hope your only bridge falls down and kills you all.  And then he's talking about Rocky.  Yeah, you treat Joe Frazier like crap.  Because you hate blacks, but you – he's a real guy.  Right.  Like it was from here.  But instead you build tribute statues to a – 
[01:06:30]  A fake guy.  A fake Italian fighter.  Oh, and it didn't stop.  We're not doing – it didn't stop.  We're not doing the material justice.  I understand that.  Go to MySpace.  Throw Opie and Anthony in the search and you'll see the bootleg Bill Burr performs from the Philly show.  YouTube too.  YouTube and MySpace.  You said MySpace.  Oh, crap.  No, I saw it on YouTube.  I have no idea if it's on MySpace.  It's definitely on YouTube.  Throw Opie and Anthony in the search on YouTube.  Eric, Jersey, what's up?  Listen, Bill Burr is God.  He made everybody from Philly just look like a bunch of tools. 
[01:07:00]  But the best thing is at the end, after he smashed them for a solid 15 minutes, he says,  F you and I'm still going to be selling my crap at the end.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, and then he pointed out that the Phillies were named after a female horse.  Oh, yeah.  And their faggy uniforms should be used to sell cotton candy at instructional games.  He wasn't doing this –  For the instructional league.  You understand?  He wasn't doing this in Boston, where he's from.  Yeah.  Right in the heart of Philly, basically. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, yeah.  You could see the damn city's skyline from where he was performing.  Yep.  Let's go to Matt.  What's up, Matt?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  I got to say, Bill Burr definitely had to save the game, the way he turned everything around on everybody.  The best line was, oh, you guys don't want to talk about Hitler?  What do you want to talk about?  Heart disease?  Okay, good, because all you mother effers are going to die of heart disease.  There's effing cheesesteaks anyway.  Yeah, and then he talked about the cheese melting out of eyeballs or something.  I don't know.  Oh, he wished cancer on the crowd so their hair would fall out. 
[01:08:00]  And then he looked at them and said, oh, you wouldn't notice on all you bald, shaved head asses.  He was pounding.  Just a pounding.  At the end, he says, okay, you've got two minutes left.  So I just bought a computer.  Yeah, and then the whole place lost it.  He was awesome.  Definitely awesome.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Let's say hi to Paul in Philly.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hi.  Hey, Ant, I sat behind your mom and your sister.  Oh.  Oh, man, your sister. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, your sister.  Your mother is a cougar, man.  A cougar.  Were they enjoying the show?  Yes, very much so.  Goodie.  Especially your sister.  The guy sitting next to her was trying to pick up on her.  He almost had his hand on her ass.  Was it big A?  It might have been her boyfriend.  No, he was taking pictures.  He was the blonde-haired guy who looked like Opie, right?  Yeah.  Interesting.  Yeah, he was taking pictures.  Some other guy was trying to pick her up. 
[01:09:00]  Maybe it was Sal.  No.  Roo.  Hey, you guys killed.  Bill Burr was excellent, man.  Oh, good.  Thanks for coming, mister.  And it says you loved seeing Bob Kelly puke?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  That was great, man.  I forgot about that one.  That was excellent.  That was so early in the day, I forgot about it.  I got the audio.  YSP gave us the audio so we could play it on our show today.  Oh, goodie.  We pretty much took over Philly for three days.  I want to thank everyone at WISP.  You guys kicked our asses. 
[01:09:30]  You treated us like rock stars.  It was unbelievable, unbelievable what they did for us down there in Philly.  And we were going on the radio off and on all day long.  We were on the radio pretty much every day we were down there.  And I guess as the crowd was filing in, we went on WISP.  Yeah.  And we know Bob Kelly, it's so easy to make him puke.  I'm thinking about that.  So, WISP is doing their live broadcast and the guy with the ear infection was right near the broadcast again. 
[01:10:00]  You know, I think people heard the show Friday morning, but we found this guy with this ear infection that just slugs come out of this guy's ear.  I can't even deal.  Just slugs.  It's this pussy substance that comes out of his ear in a big line.  Yeah, over and over again.  It looks like a big fat maggot dripping out of his ear.  Yeah, it's never ending.  So, knowing Bob Kelly pukes easily and those guys were right there as Ant and I were on the air, we had some fun with Bob Kelly. 
[01:10:30]  You want to see his ear infection?  No.  Oh, God.  This is the thing.  No.  I'm curious.  I'm curing that.  Look at that.  Ew.  Look at that.  Look at that.  He's going to puke.  He's going to hurl.  He's going to puke.  Oh, my God.  He's going to puke.  He's going to puke.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  He just puked.  Oh, God.  That was horrible.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God. 
[01:11:00]  You made Bob throw up.  I don't know if that was better than being wowed, but, oh, God.  He's in the bathroom.  He just went in the bathroom.  He's in the bathroom.  He lost Bob Kelly.  He flew out of his mouth like that stuff that hit Newman in Jurassic Park.  I'm looking at a great picture.  Iberok was there.  Good job.  And I even told Bob Kelly backstage after this.  I go, Bob, I really wasn't sure if the whole puking thing with you was just like a bit. 
[01:11:30]  Like, you know, you're just playing up to the show until I saw this.  Like, he can't help himself.  Look at that.  Look at how much he's been out of him.  Great photo.  That is him in mid-woof.  He has a weak stomach.  Wow, he really does.  How could somebody that big be so weak?  I don't know.  That's up on opianathlete.com.  So then we got him back.  He went into the bathroom.  We continue our broadcast on WISP.  And this is what happened.  All right, Bob, what happened?  Don't step on your own puking, by the way.  There's your mic again.  What happened?  What happened? 
[01:12:00]  What came out of your ear?  I told you, dude.  He's got an ear infection.  Yeah.  No, it's an ear infection.  It's healing.  It's a...  Why are you here?  Why aren't you in a hospital?  Why is it a house looking into your head?  Dude, you pulled a booger out of your ear.  Bob, he did that yesterday on the show.  And then that dude ate it.  No.  Yeah.  His face started to change.  On his spoon.  It was very delicious.  You ate it?  Yeah, let's see if you got any more in your ear.  Bob, let me see.  No, no, no, no.  No, he doesn't have any more, Bob. 
[01:12:30]  Opie, there's no way he's got more.  Opie, I know you.  There's no way he's got more.  I'm going to look at it for you, son of a bitches.  I'll look at it.  Look, right there.  Hang on.  Look, right there, Bob.  Oh, my God.  Just in case you people think Bob Kelly puking is a bit, you can take a look at that. 
[01:13:00]  He's still throwing up.  He's still throwing up over there.  He's throwing up in the dry scam.  So that was the second time he puked.  And then he was gone for a little while.  And we're like, there's no way we could get him for a third.  Not three times.  And the third time was the showstopper.  That's the picture we're looking at, by the way.  Yep.  On opiumathety.com.  Bob, come here.  We got to smooth things over with Bob Kelly.  Bobby, coming back?  Yeah, we got to smooth things over for Bob.  All right.  Bob, we got to smooth things over. 
[01:13:30]  We got to smooth things over.  I'm sorry.  All right.  I'm sorry we got to the puke.  Look.  Look, come here.  Come here.  No, Opie, you're acting like I don't know you.  You're acting like I've never.  But he's going to apologize to you.  I'm not shaking it.  Are you out of your mind?  Will you just listen to what the man has to say?  Who's it?  Bob, I'm a big fan of yours.  I love Torax.  Torax.  Yeah.  And just so you know how much I love you here.  Check this out.  Oh, man.  He just ate it.  That way.  That way.  That way.  Oh, he almost kicked on my shoes. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, there he goes.  Three times.  Howdy, forward.  One, WI.  If you feel it, L.P.  Oh, and a nice shot of it, too.  I need a bite.  All right.  Oh, wow.  Hey, ladies and gentlemen, there's a photo op.  If you would like to see Bob Kelly's puke, it's right here.  Yeah, it was all over the floor.  That third one was a charm, man.  You got that on video, too.  Yeah, he unleashed. 
[01:14:30]  It was amazing.  Well, you know what happened?  The guy had it on his finger.  Yeah.  And the other guy leaned over and just lapped it up.  Oh, God.  Some other guy, yeah, just went.  And that caused Bob to get violently sick.  There you go.  All the pictures are going up on opiananthony.com.  You got to bring in that video, Anthony, so we can get that up on opiananthony.com.  Send it over to Steve.  Bill Burr just trashing the crowd, trashing 10,000 people.  The bootleg version is up on YouTube. 
[01:15:00]  Just throw opiananthony in the search.  We're trying to get the rights to that so we can play it on the show.  We'd love to.  We can't at this moment, but we'd love to.  And Bill Burr's coming in at 8 o'clock to discuss what happened down there in Camden.  And also we got Mark Burnett calling in, and Damon Wayans is stopping by today.  Let's see.  Dawn, my sister, was sitting next to a gay couple who love you guys.  One of them was crippled also.  Didn't know that.  It was a gay couple. 
[01:15:30]  That's horrific.  So maybe he's not gay by choice.  Exactly.  Maybe he just falls down a lot.  Bird from Philly.  Yeah.  I must note that in person, no filter, Paul looks like a caricature of a human being.  All of his features are a little too big.  But his head is too small.  He has a shrunken head.  Shrunken head.  People had fun meeting everybody and seeing people they hear on the air.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Great show, man.  We'll continue in just a bit. 
[01:16:00]  When you call this effing show, there are four words that you must know.  Learn to punch out.  I'm punching out.  I'm punching out.  I'm punching out.  I'm punching out.  You guys are great.  You ever do that?  I'm angry.  Where are you going on?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:16:30]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Very somber day.  On this September 11th, your somber day.  All right.  How about them Cowboys, Jimmy?  What happened?  I didn't watch.  But Drew Bledsoe, I think, does what he normally does, which was throw interceptions.  I don't care about them.  I lost interest in sports.  I don't know what happened.  Yeah.  These are ten games in first, and I don't care. 
[01:17:00]  Well, we know why.  Probably.  I don't know.  I love Rivera.  How about taking a night off to come watch Jim Norton?  Ooh.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I didn't watch football yesterday at all.  I slept late in the hotel because of the room service at the Silvertel.  She'll be firebombed.  My God, was that awful.  I thought it was just me.  No.  I thought it was me.  I went back after the show, and for some reason, everything was shut down, and I don't  think we wanted to really go out in Camden, so we all decided we were going to go back 
[01:17:30]  to the hotel.  By the way, really fast.  That was a scary ride back to Philly because after the show at the Tweeter Center in Camden,  New Jersey, we all decided that we wanted to do a little meet and greet.  That was real smart considering there was like 10,000 plus people there.  Yeah, it was hours.  And we made a little announcement that we'll be signing autographs, taking pictures, and  saying hi over there, and we're thinking there'll be a couple hundred silly geese that decide,  ah, what the hell, I'll meet the guys. 
[01:18:00]  We get there.  We sit down.  You couldn't even see the end of the line.  Oh, thousands.  And some of the people around us very, very mad that we made that announcement on the  stage.  Make a long story short, at least two hours later, we finally pile into Vanity.  We had plans to go back to Philly.  Go back to Philly.  We met every single person that was on that line.  There was nothing, no place open really to go to, like a diner or something.  So we all just said, screw it.  Go back to our respective rooms and get room service, which was still open till what? 
[01:18:30]  It was supposed to be open till three o'clock on Saturday night.  Saturday night.  So we get back at, do you remember?  One something.  Yeah, one, one thirty.  I know I ordered at one thirty.  Yeah, that's about when I ordered.  Me and my girlfriend order, and we're waiting, waiting.  Bah, fall asleep.  We fall asleep, which isn't hard to do after a day like that. 
[01:19:00]  But didn't wake up from a knock on the door, from a telephone ringing, or anything else.  They just never brought the room service.  And the whole time I was thinking, oh my God, we must have really passed out because we didn't  even wake up for the door knocking.  But they never came.  In the hotel we're talking about is the Sofitel in Philly on Sansom Street.  Maybe somebody there knows people in room service there. 
[01:19:30]  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  So maybe you, if you know somebody who works there, maybe you could figure out what happened.  What happened?  We ordered at one thirty.  I was with a friend of mine, and we just wanted to eat something.  One thirty the order goes in.  Two thirty, nothing has come.  So I called down, and the retard, who answers the phone, goes, I just kind of realized that  I misplaced your paper.  I don't have the paper.  So what was your order again?  And I'm like, you haven't even started it? 
[01:20:00]  And he goes, no.  So I give him the order again, and I remember the beverage was club soda with a splash of  cranberry.  So he goes, all right, it'll be about a half hour.  And I'm like, wait a minute.  Can't you prioritize it and put it at the head of the line?  Right, since they screwed you up.  And he goes, well, we're really backed up.  Twenty-five minutes later, they close at three.  I call like three minutes to three.  And I call the manager, and she goes down to see what happens.  She calls me back after three. 
[01:20:30]  Food, all right?  And she goes, they're cooking it now.  Oh, God.  It'll be another twenty minutes.  And I'm glad that it wasn't her problem, but she was nice.  But the guy who took the order, I'm glad he wasn't there because I would have bitten him.  I would have physically just bitten him.  Yeah, just bite him.  Finally, my food comes up two hours later.  And the only reason I knew it came up is because the retard who took the order, forgot the order,  then made me wait for the order, brought the food up, and knocked on the door next door. 
[01:21:00]  I heard the faint knocking.  Oh, my God.  It was like this.  So I'm like, he's either knocking at another door, or there's an AIDS patient delivering our food.  Can't work up his strength for a decent knock.  I open the door.  He bumbles in with his stupid beard.  He apologized.  I couldn't look at him.  And he left.  I was sulking.  Do you want to hear my room?  Well, yes.  I saw you leaning in.  No pause. 
[01:21:30]  I see Kenny's mouth right by the mic, and I see his lips going.  I have a story.  Heard my failure as far as room service went.  Heard Jimmy's debacle.  Our own club, Zoda Kenny, had a bit of a problem.  And if anybody knows anybody at the Sofitel in Philly, maybe you can figure out why we didn't get our beverage with a splash of cranberry.  I love the Sofitel.  That bed was really comfortable.  Yeah, the bed was fantastic.  When you're laying there at 5 a.m. with a fat stomach full of food that you should have eaten two hours ago. 
[01:22:00]  Sure beats sleeping on the sidewalk like I have been.  Being a homeless shock jock, that bed was very, very comfortable.  Pillow top.  That was a pillow top.  Yeah, it was very good.  I'm going to get one of those from 1-800-MATRESS.  Yes, it was a lovely hotel.  Eventually get my pad.  Two nights in a row I had to call security because of the spoiled rich kids in the room next to me making noise.  So if you like not getting your food for two hours and then spoiled rich kids making noise in the room next door, feel free.  The Sofitel is for you. 
[01:22:30]  Kenny?  Kenny, what happened?  Well, I also do have a room service story.  After working 13 hours that day and not having dinner, I went back to my room and I ordered a burger and a bottle of water, turned on Saturday Night Live and fell asleep.  An hour later I woke up and I knew I wouldn't sleep through the knock, so I called downstairs.  I go, where's my food?  They go, it's on its way up right now.  An hour later.  Yeah.  When they promise you, like, 20 to 30 minutes.  Yeah.  They suck. 
[01:23:00]  So 10 minutes go by, knock on the door, the guy comes in, I go, what took so long for my food?  He goes, we delivered it to the wrong room.  And as he's bringing it in, I see my check on top and somebody signed my check.  I go, what do you mean you delivered it to the wrong room?  Did they touch my food?  And the guy's like, I don't know.  I go, you don't know.  I don't want it.  Not Kenny.  Yeah.  Oh, you, you, that must have driven you crazy, just the thought.  This way, this jackass probably got a call from that room and said, we got the wrong food. 
[01:23:30]  He came back up and brought it to you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Instead of immediately bringing it back downstairs and just recooking it.  Some nasty hands on it, going, this isn't my burger, like, touching it and flipping it over.  Seeing if it has what he ordered on it.  No, mine's got bacon on it.  No.  Yeah, so he goes, I'll cook you another one.  I go, it's 3.30 in the morning.  I got to go to sleep.  Yeah.  You know, so I said, just forget it.  So I pick up the phone, call downstairs.  I go, is the manager on duty?  And the girl, Andrea, gets on the phone and I explain the whole story to her like I just 
[01:24:00]  did now.  And she goes, oh, that's totally unacceptable.  I go, I know.  That's why I'm calling you.  So she goes, what would you like me to do?  I go, what can you do?  It's 3.30 in the morning.  She goes, what would you like me to do?  I go, I shouldn't pay for my hotel room tonight.  She goes, okay.  I go, oh, all right.  Thanks.  Goodbye.  Click.  Free hotel room for the night.  And believe me, I'm calling the sales guy that I dealt with at the Sofitel today.  Yeah, make sure.  And I'm going to let them know about the other misfortunes and I'm going to work a deal.  Everybody got their room service screwed up that night. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, they gave me free, my room service was free, two hours.  And I told her, I was mentioning it on the air, and I kind of love slash hate yanking that  card.  But I told her, remember on Monday that this happened.  I want you to remember this.  And she was very nice.  It was the retard working there.  I could not believe that it wasn't us.  I thought, oh, my God, we passed out and slept through the knock. 
[01:25:00]  They'd never call.  Like, I'm thinking, if you knock on the door and no one answers and they called room service,  you would call the room.  Right, right.  And say, hey, your food's ready.  They never came with it.  How long are you supposed to wait for food and club soda with a splash of cranberry?  Well, you know, normally the Sofitel is a good hotel.  That's why I put you fancy people there.  I've been there many times.  I like to place.  I've got to be honest with you. 
[01:25:30]  And how to be like a new retarded room service guy.  Try the wine.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Good evening.  Good evening to you, too, sir.  The 9-11 tributes continue on the news stations.  Oh, do they?  This is the intro to the Today Show this morning.  Sombra music?  Oh, yeah.  Good morning.  Five years ago, the day dawned bright and clear.  What happened?  What happened?  No crap.  Oh, my God.  Is that today?  Did anybody actually look at the TV and go, is that today? 
[01:26:00]  Was that today?  I'm not a clue.  I forgot.  Stop it.  Everyone remembers.  Everyone knows.  Just enough with the morbid music and the drama and the trying to get ratings and trying  to out morbid the next station.  Oh, we remember.  I bet you Matt didn't sleep last night.  And like we were talking about.  I had to get ready for the big day, the big memorial.  Yeah, the big day.  The big anniversary.  Like we were saying, where's the anger?  Enough with the sorrow. 
[01:26:30]  Where's the anger?  The sheer hatred and anger and want to nail these animals that did this five years ago.  No, it's all about let's all hug and cry together.  Dab each other's tears.  There's not one mention from these phonies about the rage people feel.  Right.  Or the student visas that these idiots are still giving out.  Exactly.  Good morning.  Five years ago, the day dawned bright and clear.  It's a perfect fall morning.  Then, chaos. 
[01:27:00]  Confusion.  First, New York.  I watched the plane fly into the World Trade Center.  Oh, another one just hit.  I'm going to die, aren't I?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  Then, in Washington.  There was an explosion of some kind here at the Pentagon.  At the same time, despair in the air above Pennsylvania.  Hi, baby.  I'm on a plane.  I said hi, Dad.  I hope to be able to see your face again, baby.  I love you.  Bye. 
[01:27:30]  In many ways, our innocence was lost that day.  Oh, shut up.  Again.  Emotions are still close to the surface.  See the relatives of those who still grieve and just wish there were some way, you know,  we could make them whole.  We'll remember those taken, honor those who fought to save them, and explore how far we've  come today, Monday, September 11th, 2006.  Our innocence was lost that day, you melodramatic jackass. 
[01:28:00]  I hate the news.  I hate the people on the news, the producers, the right.  I hate you all.  How about this?  You want to play those horrible, sad tapes of victims calling from the planes?  Play that every time somebody complains about profiling in an airport.  Thank you.  Play it every time somebody is saying some Muslim prayer on a plane and gets thrown off  and starts yelling and screaming, why can't I pray on the plane? 
[01:28:30]  You know why?  Because you can't.  It isn't the right time.  We're a little petrified.  Play that clip then.  Yeah, yeah, they threw somebody off the plane because he's saying he's doing Muslim prayer  on the plane.  We don't want to see that.  Sorry.  Don't want to see it.  If I can tell you're praying by the way you're praying, do it alone.  Right.  I saw a Jewish guy do it one time.  I was on a flight to Brazil, and he was standing in the front of the cabin, like rocking. 
[01:29:00]  He was, I guess, really orthodox or religious, rocking back and forth.  And I don't know what, I mean, I knew he was just praying, but I was like, why do I have  to look at you doing this?  Why are you doing that on a plane when we're all petrified of some kind of religious fanaticism?  You don't have to look at me.  Don't do it on a plane.  Paying a poverty-stricken girl for sex.  I shouldn't have to look at you doing this.  I'm Catholic.  You know what I want to do?  I want to bring a basket.  And I want to walk down the aisle and put the basket through every seat and tell them 
[01:29:30]  to put money in it, because that's what they do at my church.  Come on, money, fess up.  I don't care what religion you are.  You're stuck on this plane with me.  We're all going to have to participate in each other's religion.  Stop with the frigging praying on the plane like that.  You want to pray on a plane?  How about this?  You get it on your iPod, and you listen to it.  And then after it's done, you say to yourself, ditto.  Ditto.  Ditto.  Amen.  So we don't have to look at it.  If it's going down in flames, you got carp launch. 
[01:30:00]  Whatever you want to do.  If you look out the window, the wings are on fire, and you're going down, pray all you  want, in whatever fashion you please.  By the way, Tippy Tom covered 9-11 attacks on his homeless radio show.  Did he?  Yeah, let's see what he has to say about 9-11.  Do you know who they said was responsible for the attacks?  I don't know.  Maybe the Iranians or something?  Yeah.  Saddam Hussein or something?  I forget what the news is. 
[01:30:30]  Osama bin Laden?  Somebody, Arabic country.  I don't know exactly who did it.  But, you know, I don't know.  I know they got blew up.  All right.  Do you feel safer now, you know, thanks to what the government's doing to combat terrorism?  Do you feel safer as an American?  Oh, yeah.  They don't have a chance now.  Yeah.  They can't get at you, Tom? 
[01:31:00]  They don't have a chance.  All right.  You got so much security in every airport.  Everything, man.  I can't even get on an airplane.  You get searched.  You get checked out.  Who would search him?  Words of wisdom.  He actually could smuggle a bomb on a plane because nobody's opening those cheeks.  Yeah.  He'd be the most dangerous person.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Kevin in New York.  Kevin.  Hey, how you doing, guys? 
[01:31:30]  Hey.  What's up?  Hey, I watched that CBS thing last night.  And I got to tell you, it didn't make me sad or anything.  It could have brought back the piss feelings that I had of the day.  You know, that was the one about the firefighters and stuff.  So, you know, maybe it's not that bad of a thing to bring it back as long as everybody  just gets enraged again and, like, you know, gets pissed and wants to do something.  They're not doing that, though.  The news, it's all about sorrow and let's remember it.  And the somber music, I want to see cruise missiles.  I want to see rockets. 
[01:32:00]  I want to hear rock music.  I want to show kicking ass.  Or maybe for a 9-11 tribute, we could take some film crews up to Canada and that population  can tell us how we brought it onto ourselves with our foreign policy.  Yeah, that's another one.  That's a good one.  Or we don't even have to go that far.  How about during the wreath-lying ceremony yesterday with George Bush?  We could just go around Ground Zero where the perimeter was, where they allowed people  to walk up to, and listen to the protesters protesting how it was an inside job. 
[01:32:30]  That's another one.  Right here in the country, you know, a few yards away from Ground Zero are people protesting  that it was an inside job, big conspiracy.  Of course.  And all that.  That's nice.  A bunch of children who want mommy and daddy to notice.  They want to marry themselves to the tragedy.  Look at me.  Look at me.  You hear what he's doing?  He's figuring things out for 9-11.  Well, we have a hero in our studio right now.  Yeah, we should change gears for a minute or two. 
[01:33:00]  And then we got Damon Wayans.  He's sleeping on a couch in the green room.  But we'll wake him up and get him on the radio in a few minutes here.  But first, ladies and gentlemen.  One of the heroes.  You know, you've heard a lot about heroes, I'm sure, today watching news coverage.  That does, it pales in comparison to the hero that is in our studio right now, Mr. Bill Burr.  What's up, Bill?  Hey, gentlemen.  Wow.  We just discussed your, uh...  What did you guys do this weekend?  Oh, Jesus.  We just discussed your set in Camden.  Discussed it.  We watched it in the office. 
[01:33:30]  It's already a bootleg on YouTube.  I watched it at home last night.  I cannot get enough of it.  It is the most watchable act I've ever seen.  It's like, you could look at it, you could watch it ten times and catch something new every time.  Yeah.  Animals.  Yeah.  I literally had a headache at the end of it.  I felt like I yelled at a relative.  You know what it reminded me of?  It's like somebody that should get the congressional medal for rushing a machine gun nest and actually living through it. 
[01:34:00]  Like, and one man single-handedly took out an entire machine gun nest and bunker emplacement.  Thought you were gone.  Thought you were dead.  You turned that around.  Can you walk us through it?  Because we just, we have no idea what really happened.  We're just getting phone calls and things like that.  You walked out on stage.  I guess it was after Dom Herrera.  No, it was actually, it was after the show was about three hours and 15 minutes old. 
[01:34:30]  Right.  And ideally, Jim, what did you say, about 90 minutes is the ideal comedy show?  Yes.  And you want to go on probably 50 minutes into the 90 minutes at the latest.  An hour at the latest.  Ideally, the people aren't drinking in a parking lot for seven hours before the three hours and 15 minutes starts.  It was basically, I don't know what had happened.  It turned into OzFest up on the lawn.  Yeah.  And they were booing guys.  Like, even guys who were doing well.  I was kind of walking to the side and they were booing and it was just getting worse and worse and worse. 
[01:35:00]  So, you heard where it was coming from.  I really had no idea.  They kept saying it was up to the left.  It sounded to me when I was out there like it was coming from everywhere.  I can't admit.  But, so anyway, so then Dom goes out and Dom's doing a great job and it's just almost like they just decided.  Yeah, out of nowhere.  They're booing the guy.  And this is like, this guy's like from Philly.  Yep.  He's been doing it forever.  Half the reason they got comedy clubs in that damn city is because of this guy.  They boo him off like they don't even know him. 
[01:35:30]  Unbelievable.  And he's Dom's funny.  I mean, he doesn't deserve to be booed.  He's a great comic.  Exactly.  So, I was pissed and I went out there and the second I walked out, I was like, you know,  hey, you know, whatever.  I was walking down the street.  Did ya?  They started yelling and heckling.  Oh, boy.  And then I went into that Hitler bit and I was like, oh, no.  They've been playing this on Opian Ante like 9,000 times.  And I kind of messed that up.  And then they started booing me.  And fortunately, I had been booed before.  And I had made mental notes about things that I did that I liked and didn't like. 
[01:36:00]  And there was a lot more stuff that I didn't like.  So, I just, I had made a mental note the next time whatever happened.  I'm talking about all your mothers.  I'm trashing your city.  Anything I can think about.  And I'm not.  The Liberty Bell.  Rocky.  The Betsy Ross Bridge.  Cheese sticks.  The sports teams.  The fact they hate blacks.  The sports teams.  Exactly, Anthony.  I swear to God.  I already mentally worked it out.  If they started throwing stuff, I was going to go behind the DJ booth and I was still going to finish. 
[01:36:30]  I just was not.  You were dedicated to finishing.  Oh, yeah.  I was in the back watching.  Oh, it was fantastic.  Again, because you couldn't hear the audience response from the monitors.  And I saw you go, what are you people not going to laugh?  Like, you just scolded them.  I'm like, Bill, because you are like, I hate to say money in the bank.  There's a faggot expression.  I mean, really, you never had bad sets, especially gigs like this.  I'm like, how could they give Bill a hard time?  And then you just went crazy.  It was so good.  And he made all this up.  So great.  Off the cuff. 
[01:37:00]  And we need to tell people that again.  This wasn't your act.  This wasn't what you decided to do in Philly.  You were just making it up as you go along in front of 10,000 people.  That, to me, I bow to you today.  That was the funny thing.  I had a bunch of people that had come up to me.  Not all those people afterwards.  Probably at least 15 people had come up to me.  And they were like, did you just make that up?  Or is that like part of your act?  Oh, no, no.  That's a 15-minute chunk of my act when I go to Seattle.  Yeah.  I just go off on specific stuff about Philly.  And somehow it kills.  Yeah.  That's what I was amazed at, too. 
[01:37:30]  It's like, God, this guy knows a lot about Philly.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, you should be leading tours there in your time while it was fighting.  I mean, everything about Philly.  He just recalled stuff subconsciously that he'd heard in school.  It was like your whole brain works for you.  And his team's old players from the Phillies.  Like he's just Roman Gabriel.  He's pulling up old players from Joe Frazier.  You mentioned Roman Gabriel.  And the lack of respect he gets.  Roman Gabriel.  You don't know who he is.  You mentioned him.  And then you just screamed at them. 
[01:38:00]  Shut up.  Yeah.  They're not going to win ever.  They're never going to win.  It was good to see the real Bill Burr finally.  Because we know this is what you're really about.  Absolutely.  And then it finally came out for everybody.  It was fantastic to watch.  You saw the reason why I need to do this.  To me, when I was watching that, like, when you're watching you yell like that and just,  just, just berate them.  I'm like, that's what Bill hears in his head every time he looks into the mirror.  I never loved anyone as much as I loved watching you do that. 
[01:38:30]  And you, you completely turned him around when, when you were done and you did your little  countdown every, every minute.  Like I said, there's a teleprompt.  They're showing the comics how much time they had left.  And you'd berate the audience and they go, okay, six minutes.  And you kept going and going.  And I'm selling my CD.  Yeah.  And I'm selling my CD.  And then you turned them around and they're, they're laughing their asses off.  Now the laughs are much bigger than the boos, but the boos continued, right?  And you, you knew that you had them. 
[01:39:00]  And then you're like, and I still hate you people.  Yeah.  I still hate you people.  And when you left, they gave you a hell of an ovation just for, for doing that.  I got to tell you, it was one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.  I never saw a set like that in my life.  As far as comic things go.  The brutal honesty of what you did and the fact that it was, it looked fearless.  I mean, as a comic, I understand how we are internally, but just the fact that you exploded  and weren't going to back down.  And they knew it.  He's not leaving.  They knew it.  He's not leaving.  He will not leave. 
[01:39:30]  You can only boo so loud.  So they just knew that you were going to kick 10,000 people in the face for 15 minutes  until your time was up.  And it was just great.  Tony Montana up on the balcony getting shot.  Come on.  And that guy, that guy walked up to your back with a shotgun and you turn around and you  slapped him with your hog.  Yeah, it was blind rage by the end.  Oh, yeah.  To the point when I got off, I wasn't even, I was really, when I walked back there, I  didn't know what the reaction of you was going to be.  Dude, we all ran to the stage because, you know, the word spread. 
[01:40:00]  Bill Burr is getting booed and he's just attacking the crowd.  We all, every single person backstage just about was on the side stage just watching.  We're jumping up and down.  We're hugging each other.  We're falling on the ground like idiots.  We loved it.  Having gay sex.  Right.  Just had a mention.  That's right.  That's what I told myself in the rest area last night.  This one's for Billy.  And someone bootlegged it.  It's up on YouTube.  And the word hasn't even really spread. 
[01:40:30]  I mean, now it has, obviously, because we're talking about it.  But this morning it was already downloaded thousands of times.  I'm like, man, people are talking about this thing.  Yeah.  You go to YouTube and just throw Opie and Anthony in the search and there it is.  It's there.  The first time I got booed, there's this amazing feeling when you just realize you can't get him back.  And the first time I got booed, I didn't leave that time.  But I kept trying to do jokes or something.  It wasn't, I didn't leave or whatever.  And then they ended up bringing me off.  And people came up to me afterwards going, like, I got, like, these awful compliments. 
[01:41:00]  Like, I thought you were funny.  Oh, hey, yeah.  And the best one was.  You mean all the compliments Jimmy Schubert was getting after his set?  I mean, he just got thrown to the dogs.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy Schubert is hilarious.  Like, that was the thing, because I love Jimmy.  So I was pissed from the beginning of the show.  Yeah.  And having gotten booed, I know what he was going through.  And then he has got to stand there for the, what was it, the five hours.  And you two guys, Jesus Christ, before I go up, these two stand-up virgins, hey, we got this great idea. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, we were just trying.  We're going to walk 40 rows in the crowd.  Through the crowd, yeah.  That's great.  Anything you can do to steal their focus more from the stage and whip them in the show.  Hey, so we get credit for your brilliant set that people will be talking about for years.  And then they go to the concert.  And right after we intro you 50 rows in, the two stars of the show, we're just going to cut off the lights.  And they're not going to look at us and try to find out where we're going.  I thought that was a little ridiculous, too.  Like, I was like, uh-oh, this could be distracting to the comedian. 
[01:42:00]  We make it up as we go along.  What can I tell you?  We won't do that again, Bill.  But Jimmy Shearer was your biggest cheerleader on the side of the stage.  He was jumping up and down just applauding.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, we were joking about that afterwards.  I felt like we caught the last chopper on a nom.  We were going to look down and see, like, Dom Irera, like Willem Dafoe, in the tree line.  Oh, it was brutal.  It was unbelievable.  You must have seen him.  It was platoon.  You must have seen him, though, getting booed, know what it's like to be booed, saw what the crowd was like, 
[01:42:30]  and kind of prepared yourself.  Like, if these sons of bitches even try, I am unloading.  My mindset when I walked out was, you animals, you don't even deserve a show.  I'm going to come out here and I'm going to start tap dancing and try to get your attention.  You're not even giving anybody any chances.  So the second they started moving, you were already locked and loaded, ready to go.  I'm talking about teams.  I'm talking about it.  It's like, I don't know why I even ironed my shirt to come out here.  I don't even remember half the stuff I said. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, my God.  Total terrestre.  I've watched it like ten times already.  It is all good and it is all brutal.  Yeah.  It's just fantastic.  I've never, ever seen a set like that.  I've never seen anyone handle a stupid heckler in a club is one thing.  You got 10,000 people and you just trashed them to the point where they loved you when  you left.  Yeah.  Is it linked to opianthony.com?  I think it might be.  It should be.  I tried to.  Hey, we got to take a break.  We're really late.  We got David Wayans.  We got to wake him up.  Bill Burr's in studio.  We'll talk a little more about what happened down there in Camden. 
[01:43:30]  Also, we got a pretty cool contest that is happening as we speak.  Send us your 30 second or less production piece about the Opian Anthony show.  On the week of October 2nd, we're going to announce the best five entries.  We did this one other time.  It wasn't that great because we didn't have enough time.  This time, we have about a month, so we should get some great entries.  Submit your entry at 923freefm.com, 923freefm.com by September 29th at 9 a.m.  And you can win the new MacBook.  That's very cool.  I think we got five of those to give away, right?  Yeah. 
[01:44:00]  It has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities, and you can take  it with you wherever you go.  Head to the Apple Store or apple.com to check it out.  And at 8.46 a.m. and 9.03 a.m., I am bouncing a crapload of people off of PalTalk as a tribute  to 9-11.  Random people.  You might have just been chatting with them on PalTalk.  You won't know who it is.  Bouncing. 
[01:44:30]  That's my tribute.  Ugh.  Whatever.  Haunting.  And I want to play some somber music behind it, like they're doing on the news.  Exploitive jackasses.  Did we wake up, Damon?  Hello.  He's getting a cup of tea.  All right.  He's getting a cup of tea.  He'll join the program next.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  Our duties do, do, do, fall.  Our duties do, do, do, fall.  Our duties do, do, do, do, have destructive power.  You think it stinks now.  You should have seen it a month ago. 
[01:45:00]  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O.B. and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Very busy morning.  We got Bill Burr in studio.  We were just talking about what happened to him in Camden, New Jersey.  And we say hi to Damon Wayans.  He's also in studio.  He was sleeping about 10, 15 minutes ago. 
[01:45:30]  We had to wake him up for his appearance here.  Lucky Damon.  Jesus.  You know, you got to stay ready so you don't have to get ready.  So, you know, I was on there just visualizing how much fun we're going to have today.  How early do you usually get up?  Can't be this early, right?  No, I get up this early.  Do you?  Work out.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you work out.  You do like?  Do all that stuff, yeah.  I mean, this is, you know, this is god-awful early.  Yeah.  But, you know, I'm up 8 o'clock.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, but that's West Coast time.  So that's like 11.  West Coast time.  Three hours.  Yeah.  Oh, okay. 
[01:46:00]  I bet I'm up at like 5 in the morning.  Did you hear us talking about what happened to Bill Burr in Camden?  Oh, yeah.  It was just, I've seen a lot of comedy shows over the years.  It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.  Well, that's when the true comic is born.  It's not when you're funny when everything is going well.  It's when the stuff hits the fan and you have to test your skills and you have to, you know,  sometimes you have to let people know who's the boss and that they're your puppets.  And Bill did it.  I was saying during the commercial break, it wasn't like he was at a comedy club and he had to smash one table. 
[01:46:30]  He had to smash like 10,000 people.  And then he turned them around and we were just looking at shots during the commercial break.  He got a standing ovation by the end of it.  It was like watching a rape victim jump up and grab a strap on him.  Yeah, cute.  Yeah.  I carry a gun.  Yeah.  That'd probably help.  A couple of people, they shut up.  The rest of them are going to listen.  Usually you just got to open your coat, show it to them. 
[01:47:00]  Just let them know what's up.  Boo.  At one point you did say you were going to take out a gun.  What was the whole gun thing?  I forgot at the end of it.  You said he was going to shoot every single one of them in the head and then the guy would  have to come out and clean up three pounds of brains, which was so subtle and funny.  It's like there's only three pounds of brains within 10,000 people.  I thought it sounds smashing.  I loved it.  That made my weekend.  It just made my weekend. 
[01:47:30]  You have any connection with Philly or anything?  No, not at all.  You know, I know it's a city of brotherly love.  That's what they say.  But I've never seen a collection of more angry people than in Philly, man.  Oh.  Turns to rage.  Yeah.  Right.  They booed Santa, but that's their city slogan.  And they love bringing that stuff up.  We're the ones that booed Santa.  We're the ones that threw the batteries and the snowballs.  You know when they cheer when Michael Irvin's being taken off at a stretcher?  That's what makes them happy. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, the cowboy might be paralyzed.  Stand up.  Let's be happy.  Yeah.  There's certain cities that just, I don't know.  By the way, we love Philly.  That's why we love them.  We have this weird relationship with Philly.  It's our best market.  It really is, by far.  It's all of our cities.  You know, Boston's another one.  There is, and Opie's a huge fan of Boston.  I, on the other hand, I look at Boston as a little jealous in New York.  I'm sorry, Boston. 
[01:48:30]  Hey, hey, hey, easy.  Look, they're all mad now.  Bill, deal with this.  That's that arrogant New York attitude.  Deal with this problem.  Everything has to be about you.  It's not about me.  It's about my experiences in Boston.  Maybe you're just scared because you're more than 10 miles away from your house.  No, it wasn't.  Oh, yeah.  I'm agoraphobic, and I can't get within.  No, perhaps it's even at church the Yankee suck chant has to start.  Maybe that's it.  But you're not religious.  Who cares?  I'm just talking about there's such an, there's sort of an envy thing. 
[01:49:00]  And it does all boil down to sports for some stupid reason.  I haven't gone outside of 495, so we've probably seen pictures of New York.  I like how you've sectioned off your ethnic areas, too, where one cannot enter the other.  Oh, what?  Oh, you're talking, yeah.  Boston.  Damn it.  This is probably what you.  Boston.  I've, you know, I've had good times in Boston and bad times.  Yeah, probably depending on what street you're crossing.  Yeah.  I had somebody tell me that he thinks I should leave Boston now. 
[01:49:30]  That's fine.  How do you do?  I'm taking all the white women.  Oh, okay.  Well, then he probably had a reason.  Jesus Christ.  No, like I had them all.  Every one of them.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, all sectioned off.  Well, black crowds are notoriously rough if they don't lie.  Black crowds and Italian crowds are actually really similar.  Like, if they love you, they love you.  And if they don't, you're a dead person.  Yeah. 
[01:50:00]  And I've kind of been booed by black crowds.  You know, my sex stuff saved me, but those are always scary crowds to me.  Like, I'm always afraid to go on if I have, like, a purely black audience.  I'm afraid they're just going to hate me and boo me off.  The second they look at you.  I was off at the Apollo.  Like, you said the Apollo?  And then whoever asked me went, hello?  Hello?  That's tough for anybody, though.  The great thing about black crowds is they at least give you a chance to be funny.  As soon as you, you know, as they, you know, realize that you're not going to be funny, 
[01:50:30]  then, you know, all hell breaks loose.  But black people, they will sit and listen and go, all right, you got about five more seconds.  Yeah, I've watched Showtime at the Apollo and seen people walk out and get a great ovation.  And they start, and there's, like, this little gap.  Right.  And it's like, okay, I'll give you a minute.  And then just, boo, you suck.  Get off.  Like, oh, black crowds.  He's trying to rap.  They're going to have, black crowds is going to have fun with or without you.  Like, you either come out there, you make them laugh, they'll laugh with you. 
[01:51:00]  And then if you suck, they basically, you tell a joke, it doesn't get a laugh, and then everybody laughs.  Right.  Because it didn't get a laugh.  Then they start talking about you.  I think they're actually...  I've had a lot of bombs, I guess.  They're actually, I think, probably a little bit, a lot of times, gentler to white comedians.  I mean, it's not like I feel like there's this whole racist thing going,  because I think they give you, like, maybe an extra second, because they kind of, all right, well, he showed up.  Well, we don't know if you're the parole board or whatever.  Sometimes we have to wait and see.  One thing I've seen from watching the Apollo is a black audience will give an Asian guy, like, all the time in the world. 
[01:51:30]  Right.  You see an Asian guy rapping, they just think it's the funniest goddamn thing in that night.  A guy's going to win the whole thing at the end.  Like, why are they giving this guy the time of day?  He sucks.  But he's got a small penis, so you...  You gotta cut him some slack. 
[01:52:00]  God damn.  You ever play the Apollo?  I played the Apollo, yeah.  I was there about a year and a half ago.  Yeah.  Blew it up.  You know, it's hometown.  Yeah.  I'm from New York, plus, you know...  You've got a good ovation.  Yeah.  They know your name.  They love me.  I think they know who you are.  And, you know, I know that I gotta bring my A game.  I can't just walk into Apollo and improvise.  Yeah, because even though you are known, then bring it.  Yeah.  They'll give you some time for that.  I'd love to have that, to be able to say, we blew Damon Wayans out here.  What a great Sandman came out and kicked his ass off the stage. 
[01:52:30]  I've seen, Damon, this is what I love about you, is I've seen you go into the cellar sometimes,  like, just going, like, or the strip, like, one in the morning, really late, and just do  an hour.  Sometimes it's great.  Sometimes they don't like it, but you don't care.  I've never seen him care.  It's just working on material and not using the I'm famous factor to get loud.  It's just great to watch, man, to see somebody working on material, regardless of whether  they're enjoying it or not.  Well, the beautiful thing about stand-up is you can't, you know, if you really, you know,  love it, you can really grow.  And it's therapy for me.  That's why I don't ever trip. 
[01:53:00]  A good set, a bad set, it don't mean, I don't, as soon as I walk off stage, it's done.  I can't change it, and I'm cool with it.  I live with it.  But for the most part, it's about going up there and just speaking my mind.  That's somebody who's been in it, you know, for a while.  No, for a while.  No, that's true.  That's pretty good, though.  I saw one of his jaded sets years ago.  You were working on that character that, yo, Damonson.  Remember that?  Oh, Damonson, when I was doing the pimp.  Yeah, and he was saying all this evil stuff.  And some English, it was like, probably like 20 people at like one in the morning. 
[01:53:30]  He's just saying, the character's saying the most evil stuff ever.  I remember this white lady from England is like, yo, yo, Avo.  And she's just yelling as she's walking out.  And you're just going, good, leave.  I don't care.  I really don't care.  I don't think you can grow if you care.  You know what I mean?  The audience, I've watched some of the greats.  I've watched Richard Pryor perform, you know, come up on stage with nothing.  I watched Sam Kennison, the birth of Sam Kennison, who was just a doorman at the comedy store. 
[01:54:00]  Right.  And he was this little gentle, fat guy.  And then they kept putting him up last, so he started yelling.  He would do the yelling thing and make the comics laugh.  And then it just became, he became the beast, you know.  Yeah.  And he became the guy you didn't want to follow, you know.  Sam was brilliant.  The crowd, I think, understands when you, like, if you, there's a weird mentality.  It's like a girl.  Like, if you have a lack of respect for them, they come around.  But if you need them too much, they kind of, they know they have you and they resent you for it.  And then they kill you.  Well, the thing is, I realize that the audience, you can't give them that much power. 
[01:54:30]  You have to respect them.  But for the most part, they'll laugh at Carrot Top.  They'll laugh at me.  They don't really know the difference.  They just know that it's a joke.  And what's the, you know what I mean?  It's like, you don't really understand, you know, a great comic just from a comic.  He said a joke.  And you can hear the same joke someone else did earlier and still laugh.  And you go, I can't respect you people.  I used to fight with my therapist over hating the audience at times and resenting them. 
[01:55:00]  And he was a passive-aggressive scum.  I guess he fell asleep on me once in session.  And he did.  He dozed off and I had to wake my own therapist up.  It works.  Fart.  Wake him up.  Right in his open mouth.  And I resent the audience because they try to put their morality in sometimes.  Like, there's that asterisk with the audience, like, if you violate the morality.  I saw it Saturday at the Helium.  I was going to bring it up.  Jimmy does this thing. 
[01:55:30]  It's one of my favorite things as far as watching Norton perform.  Friday at the Helium, he's working out new material for the ONA traveling virus.  And he kills.  He kills.  Saturday.  Wait.  Oh, no.  That was Thursday, I guess it would be.  Whatever.  Friday.  And then Friday, he does the exact same thing.  He's still, you know, working out his new material.  He's going to, you know, work it again.  And he doesn't get the same reaction.  And there's people in the audience doing the, oh, they're moaning and stuff and getting  annoyed by some of the stuff he's saying.  So instead of ignoring them and just plowing through, Jimmy decides to beat up the entire 
[01:56:00]  audience and make them all suffer.  Which is a little safer for me to do it in front of 40 than Bill doing it in front of  10,000.  But I love, he gets so mad he has to make the audience suffer.  And it wasn't like Bill Burr where he turned around and he's like, no, I'm going to make  sure you have a miserable time.  Watch this.  He had a baby joke that they went, oh, and then he just went way over the top with the  baby joke.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because you know how it is.  When they determine that they hate your guts, they're not going to like you or they disagree  with you.  It's like, look, we're all going to leave here feeling like we needed a shower. 
[01:56:30]  There's no way I want to die alone.  You know what I mean?  You want to bring the entire crowd down with you and then just make the headliner who's  got to go up to suffer.  He'll turn and just go, I hate you people.  And he means it.  Yeah.  And they look at him like, that's funny.  And you can tell, no, he's not joking.  He really hates you.  Because, you know, I mean, it's like whatever there's something that they disagree with,  they feel a need to make you know that they disagree with it.  Well, they don't do that in other forms of the arts.  Like, you know, you can watch a play about something and not feel a need to make the  actors know you disagree with their political point of view. 
[01:57:00]  Why do you have to do it with the comedians?  Yeah.  You guys got a rough spot, man.  It's great.  Well, Damon's in studio.  We'll talk about the new show after the break.  We've got to take a quick break.  It's called the Underground, a half-hour sketch comedy series premiering this Thursday, right?  This Thursday on Showtime.  10 p.m.  10 p.m.?  Okay.  We'll talk about that next with Damon.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yep.  Okay.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:57:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Damon Wayans in studio.  Just a reminder, tomorrow we're going to go over the football picks of the staff.  We got $10,000 up for grabs, courtesy of Dish Network.  More football for you, better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  All right.  I was walking through Philly, and I think I was with Kenny, and I saw a poster with Damon  on it, and it was for the Underground, and I had no idea you were doing another project.  See, every time I turn around, you're doing something, and it was like one of those, like, 
[01:58:00]  you know, like guerrilla marketing to do, and they just put all these posters that are  illegal all over the place.  It's the best way to market.  And it was like in a window of some eatery.  And I'm like, what is he doing now?  So, all right, Showtime, and when is it?  And what is it about?  It's sketch comedy.  I'm trying to, you know, bring it back, trying to take it to another level.  You know, Showtime, they say they don't have no limits, so.  You're going to find out, right?  Oh, yeah.  We did the vagina monologues with real vaginas.  Okay.  That's just an idea of, you know, where we went, and it's just, it's really funny.  I mean, I haven't been this funny since In Living Color, you know, so I'm really a big 
[01:58:30]  fan of my own show.  How competitive are all the brothers?  Comedically, you know, the thing is, like, I think we're very competitive, but I do stand-up.  Sean does stand-up.  I kind of taught Sean how to do stand-up, so, you know, it's like he has that kind of  master teacher kind of thing.  But in a house, when we're hanging out, very competitive. 
[01:59:00]  It's like there's a joke on the table, somebody better go get it.  Yeah.  And it's just a free call.  The business itself is so, like, up and down, roller coaster, you know, like sometime  one guy will be riding high and the other guy's looking for work and stuff, and it seems  like your family's been the same way.  You know, you've had your ups and downs, and how do you, do you go through that?  Do you actually, you know, ha-ha, I'm doing really well right now, and they teased me 
[01:59:30]  about Blank Man, RCX.  I got probably the most downs, because I've, you know, I've just, I just, you know, I just  like to experiment.  I just try it, you know?  But you actually, I think, had the biggest name, like, don't tell Malin that, but yes,  I mean, I think, I mean.  I think Homie the Clown probably solidified me as, you know.  Huge.  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Somebody who people recognize, but.  When you make a catchphrase, it's all over, Johnny. 
[02:00:00]  Everybody, people who didn't watch the show know who Homie the Clown was.  Yeah.  And you got a movie, were you doing a Homie the Clown movie?  I saw that?  Nah, that's dead.  But I will be doing the Mr. Grumpy movie, which is somebody from the underground, you  know, remix.  You know, he's an anger management specialist.  It's just, it's so political that the, you know, I don't know what the relationship is  over at Fox, but the Homie the Clown movie ain't gonna happen.  But the underground, it goes down.  You've had a lot of guys, and there's one, there's something Damien used to do in his 
[02:00:30]  act about, what was it, about the crippled bullies?  Oh, yeah.  And there was a character where he would pull his, like, in other words, he left your right  arm up, and it's like the retard character you see, or the crippled character you see  everybody doing has been stolen from you.  You were the guy that came up with that, the first one I ever started to do it.  You already, like, watched people doing your character on the, hey, stop being crippled.  Yeah, you'd start beating up real cripples.  That's my cripple, yeah.  I'm sorry.  That was the first time I ever saw you. 
[02:01:00]  I don't even know what it was.  Very early, early, mid-80s, maybe?  You were talking about the crippled people's shoes?  I was actually born with a club foot, so, you know.  Yeah, you worked that into your act, man.  I had an orthopedic shoe, and, you know, I did the whole thing.  I used to hang out with the crippled kids because they, you know, they could relate to me.  I mean, I would hang out with them privately, but when we got out around, you know, the  other kids, he was like, aren't you my friend?  Oh, you're not. 
[02:01:30]  Then you got to look cool, so you got to push him in the face.  Damn.  Take their lunch, Lenny.  Didn't Robert Townsend host that?  It was like a stand-up special, I remember, from years ago.  Yeah, the Robert Townsend Partner in Crimes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  He was, like, on fire.  You heard Robert Townsend, you saw all the time, and you stopped seeing him.  They were just producing him.  I think he's running a network now, like some new black channel.  But I saw Robert at the Chris Tucker show.  I think he's going to direct Chris Tucker's concert film or something. 
[02:02:00]  So he's working.  J-Lo was, Jennifer Lopez was a dancer on that show in Living Color, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We used to sit and just watch the dancers all day.  I had a crush on each and every one of them, but I was married at the time.  Oh, yeah.  And faithful.  Fly girls.  I was going to say, yeah, I spent a lot of time in the bathroom.  Is it cheating if I aim for the face?  Almost got a spit take from David. 
[02:02:30]  It was very close.  I didn't know I could say that.  That's what...  He was like, damn, I would have said that.  That was such an original show, especially for the time.  And for Fox, I guess, it was a lot easier to get things past them, being a fledgling network, than it is now.  Kind of like Showtime.  Yeah.  There you go.  See?  No one's watching.  Let's do something that people will tune in and watch.  You guys were doing some humor that was just, you know, you did not see it on network television.  That was, like, the best time of my career, you know. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  But, yeah, we had fun.  You know, Jim and David, Alan Greer, and Jamie.  We used to spend the night there.  We would just, like, literally camp out.  You were having so much fun.  And having fun.  Jim bought a...  I don't know.  What's that?  The little monster, like a lizard that grows like...  Oh, the heel.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Yeah, he bought one of these, and then, like, I just watched this thing turn into an alligator.  And I thought it was a joke, because it would just grow so fast.  And you're like, dude, what are you feeding this thing? 
[02:03:30]  I mean, that was fun.  How funny is that, that that was the white guy from In Living Color?  He was like, yeah.  Oh, the white guy from In Living Color.  Holy crap.  You know, Jim was, like, one of the best stand-ups.  He was an impressionist, and he used to get...  Comics hated him, because he would get standing ovations with impressions.  He'd be on stage.  But he would do, like, obscure people, like Sean Penn.  And it would be so right on, you know.  And, you know, guys like Henry Fonda. 
[02:04:00]  I saw him do Michael Landon one time.  Michael Landon.  How do you do him?  And he was doing...  It was Michael Landon smiling and crying.  And it was the same expression.  Because he put that down.  It was like a frown, even when he smiled.  It was a hysterical impression.  Yeah, it was some comedy store specialist show.  I don't know if it was a tribute to Pryor or what it was, but it was, like, really old.  And he was a great stand-up.  Yeah, but then, well, I mean, he turned into a stand-up after that, because he hated doing  the impressions.  And, you know, comics would, you know, tease him about, you know, a real comic. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  And he realized that he couldn't just go up on stage and talk.  And then he started going up on stage and talk, and that's where Fire Marshal Bill came  from.  Yeah.  He was talking about, like, burning himself.  He was going to burn himself on stage because he wasn't funny.  And then he would do this guy, a burn victim.  It was brilliant.  And then all of a sudden, he's making $20 million a movie.  Yeah.  $25, $40.  I don't know what he makes.  What is he up to these days? 
[02:05:00]  At a certain point, you don't count.  They just give you a part of the planet.  So they're not saying no to you at Showtime.  That's got to be a great feeling.  It's freedom.  Being a creative person, right?  I think every comic lives for this moment, because now I have to be my own censor.  You know, it's like when you say, you know, you can just do whatever you want.  And then you start looking at what was you, and they're like, you know, guys, this is  too, this is just nasty.  It took it a little too far.  Yeah.  I don't want people to throw up. 
[02:05:30]  I don't want people to, but you just nailed it, because we do a satellite show, too,  on XM, and we're our own censors.  We do some horrific things over there, and we're waiting for the phone to ring, somebody  to tell us no, and we're like, wow, they're never going to say no to us.  So you start thinking, all right, where's my limits?  Yeah.  Well, that's what it is.  But, you know, you can't have limits.  You just have to, you know, I call this season shock and awe.  You know what I mean?  This is the one where people are going to come.  And then next, you know, next season, you know, we're going to, I don't know, I don't 
[02:06:00]  say smarter, but we're going to be really focusing on characters, because we've got great  characters.  Yeah.  Great, really, three-dimensional, hopefully people, you know, come up with the catchphrases  and all that stuff for them.  This season's the attention getter.  Yeah.  I want to create an environment where Janet Jackson could come pop her breasts out.  Well, we've got some ideas for you if you want some attention.  We're really good at getting attention from our ideas.  Oh, yeah.  A couple of times.  You don't mind being unemployed for 26 months?  Might want to do a sketch at St. Pat's.  I don't know.  Yeah, that worked well. 
[02:06:30]  Right.  How many episodes did they give you?  Oh, they'll be talking.  We did 10.  10?  Yeah.  So it's...  What are some of the topics you cover?  Well, we did Iraqi's Funniest Home Videos.  Nice.  We...  Balls Out Jeans.  Let's see.  We got...  Balls Out Jeans.  Stravante.  He's a guy who likes...  He's an ex-con who likes white women, but he likes them mature, so he falls in love with  someone's grandma.  Oh, my God.  We have... 
[02:07:00]  Let's see.  Who else?  African Cookin' Show.  It's like when it was, you know, like in the bush, he's the...  What is it?  Emeril Lagasse?  Yeah.  Yeah, and he makes, like, cannibal dishes.  Who else would we do?  Super N-word.  Superhero.  Fights crime.  He's got this huge penis.  Nice.  He rescues people with it. 
[02:07:30]  I gotta get show time.  That's funny.  Isn't it great to have the creative freedom just to, like, explore stuff like that?  And even stuff that's not language restrictive, just content that you can't touch on network  TV, you can touch there.  If you can think it, you can do it.  That's, you know, on the show.  And then that's just characters I've done.  But, you know, Aerie Spears is on it, and he's, like, hilarious.  We did Shaq undercover.  Yeah, Aerie does a great Shaq, man.  Right on the money.  It's crazy.  Shaq is, like, he does, like, assignments where he goes undercover to, like, infiltrate 
[02:08:00]  the Chinese mafia.  And no one knows it's Shaq.  Oh, that's great, man.  We got a Make-A-Wish foundation.  Like, the parents make the wish, so they use their kid, their dying kid, to get celebrities  to show up and perform for them and give them money.  It's out there, man.  It sounds great, man. 
[02:08:30]  I'll be watching, definitely.  So you're not worried about, like, pissing people off or offending people or getting letters?  I want to.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's better than watching dead babies on TV.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  It's like, you gotta, I need to laugh, and I need to, like, I want to turn on the TV,  and there's just nothing.  Well, there's nothing to laugh at today on TV.  Oh, no, no.  It's all about making us as sad as humanly possible, so.  Yeah.  Enjoy your TV today.  Very somber.  All the news women, they have their hair pulled back, because that's, you know, the look for today. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, the ones that are dressed like, they're dressed like whores every day of the week.  They got their cans hanging out.  It's almost another spit tank.  Every day they're out there just showing, and today they're buttoned up, black turtlenecks.  They're in mourning.  Whores.  Whores.  Dirty girls.  Who are you trying to, who are you trying to bullcrap?  I could say the 10 minutes, and I'll say, yeah.  Oliver Stone had it right in Natural Born Killers.  It was a brilliant take he did of a woman who's braless in a white shirt doing the news,  and it was a great statement about it.  He just focused on her chest.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  Who cares about her head?  It could have been lopped off.  You wouldn't notice until the words stopped.  And we got the moments of silence.  We got speeches.  We got some guy that was playing a cello.  That's it.  Oh, I didn't do my tribute.  My tribute is to just randomly boot people off of Pal Talk.  Pal Talk.  There you go.  The music is being played, which means that we're wrapping up here.  The Underground is Damon's show, and it's on Showtime, September 14th.  It was 10 o'clock?  10 o'clock.  And you got 10 episodes.  10 episodes every Thursday night's head. 
[02:10:00]  And, yeah, there'll be replays through the week.  Okay.  So you can, like, kind of team-o it, and we'll watch a lot of it.  There's a reason to watch Showtime now.  I'm psyched.  I'll be watching Thursday.  That's good, man.  You were part of one of the most innovative sketch shows ever, so it's great to see you  and I'm happy to be back.  All right, everyone.  It's Damon Wayans and Bill Burr.  Thanks, Bill.  Okay.  We'll continue over at XM.  If you're not joining us over there, have a great day.  All right, what's the problem? 
[02:10:30]  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks.  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages that run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yep.  You betcha.  You might be right. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Wow, that's really nice.  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not exactly what you do.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks.  Call him.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing.  At least they're not funding terrorism.  The O.P. and Anthony XM walkover begins now. 
[02:11:30]  Drack.  Drack, we're making the getaway.  Look at him, of course, right to the shade he goes.  Every time he walks through the sun, there's like dust just falling behind him.  It's like watching somebody covered in white powder walk.  Little pieces of him.  Like he says.  Blah.  Blah.  Prosperato.  With his little casket over his shoulder.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  My God, I barely realized we were on. 
[02:12:00]  Jesus, look at this guy's stomach.  Oh, he's awful.  Yeah, he's one of those guys, he's still wearing the same waist that he had in high school.  When it folds over.  He just has it.  A foot below his Puig line.  We are waiting for you.  Very good.  We are waiting for you.  Don't you hate awful attempts at humor?  Yes, but especially when they won't fuck me after.  I was hoping she was homeless.  What was that?  I don't know.  There was a lady trying to be funny.  What was she?  You guys probably trashed her.  Oh, go fuck yourself. 
[02:12:30]  She'd probably talk to a therapist.  I'm going to confront them.  Confront them.  Are you waiting for me?  No.  No, we're not.  We're not.  Older Florence Henderson.  Enough of you.  I just wish I had improv skills.  And when she asked that, I would have said, yes, someone told me there was a cunt on her way.  Of course, now I'll say that she's fucking two blocks away.  I had no idea who she was.  I don't know if she worked for anybody.  Delayed courage.  Can you let me in on this?  I just joined you guys.  What happened?  Some broad just walked up and said, are you waiting for me?  Are you waiting for me? 
[02:13:00]  And then walked away.  Yeah.  I didn't even know what she was talking about.  And I said something funny as she reached Brooklyn.  Too bad they didn't boo me in Philly.  Then I could have fucking been really funny in the van ride home.  And not what I needed is.  Once again.  I was in the elevator with Damon.  I just explained our weird job about now we broadcast on the street and go to XM.  Yeah.  He wants to do the XM show so bad now.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  But he's got a lot of things he's got to do today.  But he took down the address.  He said he's going to try to stop by tomorrow.  The uncensored version. 
[02:13:30]  You know, I ran into Al Dukes in the hallway.  Yeah.  And he goes, do you know you said to kill Muslims on the show today?  Yeah.  And I don't know if I said it in that context.  No, you said it makes me.  It makes me want to kill Muslims or those filthy animals or whatever.  I believe it was dumped.  Okay.  Was it?  It wasn't dumped?  Oh, good.  No, you didn't encourage people to kill Muslims.  What you said is it makes me angry.  Yeah. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, sorry.  And it makes me want to kill, angry, kill Muslims.  You gave a gut reaction to the way you felt when you watched the footage.  I should be fine.  The way a lot of people feel.  Because that's what it was all about.  You know, at that time, at the moment it happened, you weren't thinking about how sad we're going to be in five years.  You're thinking, let's collect up all the people responsible for this and run them through a fucking meat grinder.  And.  Oh, look at the bunt.  Jesus Christ.  Awful.  Give her a break.  She's 63.  Aw, did you see the bunt? 
[02:14:30]  She's like she's 24 and she let herself go in college.  I don't think any woman of any age should have the bunt.  Not at all.  Watch out for the bus tires.  Hi, miss.  Hi, how are you?  Hello.  Jimmy's making friends.  I'm a friendly guy.  Yeah.  She has that creepy little bit of hair under the chin, but not much like you can see when the sunlight hits it a certain way.  Yeah, when the sun hits it right, she needs to get that waxed or electrolysis. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah, that's something you notice by the third date.  You've already said too many emotional things.  Too many emotional things, huh?  Now you actually have to be a breakup after three days.  Like, oh, God.  And you feel shallow.  You're like, wow, I didn't realize you had a stash.  I know.  Why did I say I was thinking about you, too?  It's just going to make this even worse.  I was thinking about you, too, but I meant to say it while I was watching a Groucho Marx video.  I see you're giving a Fidel Castro update. 
[02:15:30]  Oh, you can cross right away.  Sam, you want to walk or should we be waiting?  I'm just standing here and look at you.  Sam, you're holding up the whole show.  Rotten feet pointed out.  Oh, look how far they point out.  Oh, I hope a camp runs over your feet.  Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.  Exactly.  Has he ever gotten a compliment at any point on this show?  When he deserves one, he'll get one.  He's still too new, Bill. 
[02:16:00]  I know.  I was really coming at the whole everyone gets a ribbon after the race.  Well, Sam walks like a penguin, except he's white and whiter.  Sam, what's up with the feet?  We don't like them.  It's just how I walk.  I don't know any other way.  How about getting some orthotics?  You're fucking like a T-square.  I can't help it.  I'm not doing it on purpose.  I wish I knew how to walk otherwise.  That's because your feet, there's something wrong with your feet.  He walks like he's going uphill with skis on. 
[02:16:30]  I enjoyed that one.  Being a skier.  That is really funny.  He needs to be hobbled just to fix his feet.  Yeah, yeah.  His feet are fucked up because there's something with the arches that are not good.  So if he gets orthotics, it will fix it.  I'm telling you.  That looks like more of an ankle problem than an arch problem.  Well, okay.  Ankle problem.  But orthotics can fix that.  I want to twist his feet back the right way.  Isn't hobbled done with like one of those big wooden hammers? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, a big hammer and a piece of railroad ties.  Mallet.  And a mallet.  Yeah, a big mallet.  We want to mallet your ankles.  Just to knock them over the right way.  Over here.  Don't block the door.  Over here.  Club soda.  Sam should have had the metal bar between the two feet as a kid.  Oh, that would have done it.  Right.  That would have helped you out.  And then all kids could have made fun of you.  You must come from a poor family.  They couldn't do that for you.  I don't know of any metal bar between my feet.  Why is that fucking mustachioed faggot just staring at us? 
[02:17:30]  Which one?  The building guy.  I don't know.  Why?  Why does he look at us?  The neighbor in Dennis the Menace.  Oh, I want to.  You want to.  What was his name again?  Mr. Wilson.  Yeah, Mr. Wilson.  I want to hold him down and I want to put pre-cum on his mustache.  I want to lick pre-cum onto your stash.  Sir?  We got to say hi to this guy.  He's from Australia, I believe, right?  Holy shit.  It's cool.  How are you?  Yeah, good, man.  Good.  How are you guys?  Welcome.  Welcome to the state.  Sorry about the crocodile hunter, man.  I was working at a summer camp in Oregon. 
[02:18:00]  And for eight weeks, they made me fucking say crikey every fucking day.  So, I was just happy that he's dead.  Is that how you say it?  Yeah.  Happy that he's dead.  Yeah, happy that he's dead, really.  Atta boy.  But, yeah, I came and saw you guys in Camden.  It was pretty sweet, man.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, it was awesome.  How do you know about the show if you're from Australia?  I used to listen to, when I was young, Andrew Dice play.  And then I found clips of him on your show.  Then I heard Norton.  Then I heard Bill Burr.  Oh, cool.  And got exempt.  Wow.  Where do you live now?  In New York?  No, man.  I just came to visit here for three weeks. 
[02:18:30]  From Australia?  Yeah.  Two of those weeks of the trip.  Yeah, Qantas.  You know, Travolta flies routes for them.  John Travolta is a licensed pilot.  And there are times when he's going to the same place as Qantas is.  He will actually fly a plane with passengers on it for them.  That's ridiculous.  I didn't know that.  Absolutely true.  I hate this mustachioed faggot and the way he's looking at me.  He wants to suck my cock loudly.  What do you do when you can just come to New York for three weeks?  I mean, are you staying in a hostel?  Are you, like, independently wealthy?  Yeah, I'm staying at Westside YMCA.  No, not rich at all. 
[02:19:00]  Wow.  Did you come over here in your own hot air balloon?  I'm fucking fantastic.  It took me 20 hours.  Oh, yeah.  Coach?  It was worth it, though.  I saw the show at Camden.  Had to catch a fucking train.  What did you think of Bill Burr's set?  Oh, it was fantastic, man.  Awesome.  Oh, good deal.  Yeah, man.  It was fantastic.  Yeah.  If I was Australian, I would have headbutted the whole front row right in their fucking  teeth.  I was surrounded by people from Philly as well, and they weren't very happy, but, I mean,  everyone seemed to enjoy it, so it was good, man.  Oh, first time to the stage? 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, first time.  Wow.  All right.  You get to come upstairs today.  All right.  Yeah, you should be able to watch the show.  I hate that guy.  His head tapers.  All right.  The building manager's head tapers.  Look at it.  It looks like he's almost...  You know the thing from Aliens, how their fucking head would go back?  He's right there.  But he can't hear it.  He doesn't have head...  He's right...  No, he doesn't have head.  He's right picking up satellite for free with the back of his skull.  He's right there.  I'd like to fucking fix his head with a truck tire that he's right there.  One blocking just bucket. 
[02:20:00]  Just sits there with his mustache.  I want to sweat a lot and then rub my dirty, filthy balls all over his nose and mustache.  And he'll be pushing his lip up into his nose all day, smelling it, even though  he doesn't want to.  Old, sour bag.  Oh, I hate him.  All right.  Anybody else have anything today?  Nothing?  All right.  He might actually be a good guy if you get to know him, Jim.  That's a good point, Bill, mate.  Hold on.  What's that, sweetheart?  What happened? 
[02:20:30]  Joe from Oklahoma broke down four times on the fucking way.  Blew three tires.  Do my O2 sensor.  Whoa.  Oh, thank you.  So you were...  Thanks for complimenting my set, too.  Shut up.  So, no, you...  No, I like your ass.  I'm just kidding.  You showed your ass.  You like my ass?  Yes.  It was a very good ass.  Thank you.  So you were on your way from Oklahoma.  You guys drove in.  Yeah.  But was there...  No, no, but what...  All right.  Go ahead.  You just go ahead and answer before I finish asking the question.  I broke down in Illinois. 
[02:21:00]  Sorry.  All right.  I'm sure you did.  When do you guys plan on going back?  Like, do you stay in New York for a while?  A couple days.  All right.  Go ahead.  Right away.  I was going to ask a little something else, but feel free to just jump in and answer whatever  you want.  Why don't you just have the show and do it your way?  Kiss my ass.  I'd like to.  Oh.  There you go.  Right there.  You have pants on, though.  Is that your boyfriend?  Yeah, I guess so.  He's a big boy.  Oh, here's for free.  I'm a dip bum and all that happy horse shit.  All right. 
[02:21:30]  There you go.  He's got my way out.  Ooh.  Jimmy kissed her ass.  Thank you.  All right.  You guys come upstairs, too.  Thank you.  They got flat tires.  Everybody's coming up.  We'll bring most of you guys upstairs.  Let's go.  She blew three tires.  She's a good girl.  All right.  We're bringing some of the freaks aside with us.  Jimmy's favorite person at the desk, too.  What person at the desk?  I don't acknowledge anything at the desk.  Apparently, there's somebody.  A dog came in and took a big shit in the front of this hallway.  That's what I'm looking at.  Oh, I hope that guy gets fucking aged on Christmas Eve. 
[02:22:00]  There you go.  We'll continue in a bit.  O.D. Anthony.  XM202.  Massican.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of TV.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass. 
[02:22:30]  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo!  It's depressing and horrendous.  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes!  Here it comes!  The O.P. and Anthony program.  The virus.  The O.P. and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath in my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  O.P.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that bath. 
[02:23:00]  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with  Down Syndrome children.  No, baby!  It's terrible.  The O.P. and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony. 
[02:23:30]  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  The O.P. and Anthony.  We'll be right back. 
[02:24:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:24:30]  We have a flyer in New York.  Oh, it's a replay.  Thank you.  Isn't that great?  And they have to put the date like we don't know when or what.  Why would you want to watch?  I don't know.  Like all those movies that are coming out.  It's like I was here.  I saw it.  It's the worst day of my life.  I don't ever want to see it again.  Yeah.  And look, they're just showing it, what, in real time? 
[02:25:00]  You look at it.  I don't mind that.  I don't mind that.  I don't mind.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  That's that.  I don't mind that.  Obviously, the tribute thing doesn't bother me.  I mean, it makes sense.  Five years.  3,000 people die.  I understand.  Yes, they're making money off it and that kind of stuff, I guess, with ratings and stuff.  But I mean, why would you actually show the buildings on fire again?  It's just the whole sadness thing, and they want to draw the emotion from you.  And they know people just are drawn to tragedy, and they're voyeurs, you know? 
[02:25:30]  So they pop this on, and it gets ratings.  I don't know.  Have they stopped showing it yet?  No.  It's on.  It's going to probably be on right until you watch both of them fall.  I don't know.  Is MSNBC doing a whole thing where they're just showing it in real time?  Is that what they're doing?  Is this what they're doing?  I don't know.  They're showing it.  It's real time?  It looks like.  I don't know.  Yeah, look.  CNN's doing the exact same thing. 
[02:26:00]  Now they're showing the president in the school room getting the word.  Ah, getting the news.  Yeah.  What happened?  Okay, so little engine could.  Jackass.  I guess in a way this would be interesting to see it in real time.  Hmm.  I don't know.  Saw it in real time once.  Yeah, I know.  Who doesn't remember how awful that day was?  Yeah.  Oh, I missed that bit of awfulness.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  There's a little tidbit of awfulness I missed.  The horror that must have been taking place above that hole in the building. 
[02:26:30]  And when they emerged from that room, I watched as he met the responsibilities of his oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution and to be the commander in chief.  It really was an amazing moment to watch that videotape.  I just see everybody's face, who now knows, falls.  And you can see the jaws get tight as they sort of go about the next step.  Oh, we all know how it ends.  If the president stayed on with the students, why not make up some excuse for the second graders and men come out?  Look at his face.  You're like, what?  He got a lot, as you won't know, he got a lot of cases for staying on to read with the students. 
[02:27:00]  Why do that?  Well, I think the president did the right thing at the right time.  I don't know that he could have done anything else during that brief period of time.  You'll leave the goddamn classroom of kids.  Absolutely.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  I'm going to start bombing something.  Wait, I got your mic on.  Guys?  Why can't I hear Jimmy Norton?  I got every mic on.  Jimmy with his dry, salted almonds.  No, we'd hear him chewing.  Nothing. 
[02:27:30]  Guys, we'd leave for a couple days and there's always problems when we get back.  Fix it.  I, uh...  Button?  Is it a button?  It might be.  Anthony, do you have the remote where I can turn the channel?  I can maybe put on a cartoon or something?  Yeah.  Put on something else than MSNBC.  I don't want to watch those buildings burn and fall down again.  There we go.  I think it's working. 
[02:28:00]  Unless there's some kind of different ending to it.  Wait, wait, no.  And I doubt that would happen.  Why?  Oh, my God.  Sounds like a hurricane.  We're here at the center of the storm.  Hurry up.  If you haven't evacuated yet...  Please, if you haven't, just get to a safe location.  Is it fixed?  Oh, my God.  Let's see. 
[02:28:30]  Wow.  All right.  Try that mic, Jimmy.  He's got the I'm testifying mic now.  Uh, yes.  I can't answer it on the ground.  Senator.  Incriminate myself.  Yes, Senator.  I did think it was a girl when I picked her up.  Uh, there you go.  Nothing.  All right.  But while we heard it...  Doesn't matter.  That's when I needed the mic to crap out.  You know how awful it is, by the way, is a comic when you lean in to do a joke and it bombs horribly and now I have to actually lean back up? 
[02:29:00]  I, uh...  I, you mean...  You mean...  Wait, where's Kenny?  Kenny went to go do what Kenny does every day.  But I want more!  Get smoothies.  He's right over there if you need him.  Where?  Club Soda.  Should we take a break?  Do we have microphones for the show?  I tossed a bunch of people out of, um...  Pal Talk at the end.  Turn it off.  Why?  This is more interesting than what we're doing.  I want to hear the sounds of you trying to fix something. 
[02:29:30]  Yes, I want to hear it too.  I got to unplug it.  Oh, no.  No, now it's on.  Good.  But it's not going to stay on.  What'd you do?  Why?  Uh, there's a little, uh...  Damage here.  Hence the black tape around the mic.  Can't we just fix it the right way?  Yeah.  What happened?  Who damaged it?  How long's it been damaged?  About, uh, five minutes.  No, no, who...  No, someone taped it.  Someone...  Like, can't we just put a new, uh...  Thing. 
[02:30:00]  It just needs a new thing.  Yeah, I got a new wire for it.  It just needs a new thing.  You sound like Thurston Howell.  All right, let's say hi to Selena in Flushing.  Selena, what's up?  Hey, boys.  I was in, uh, Kempton on Saturday.  Where are you?  And I wanted to...  Yeah, thank you guys for hanging out for two hours after the show to sign autograph.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I was, like, the last person online.  Well, thank God you were there.  Uh, the reason for that, um, the guys were just trying to pick up trim. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Late night, match.  Well, I was the only chick in, uh, Camden, I think, that night.  You were the only chick in Camden?  I don't know.  There weren't many Asians around.  Asians?  Are you an Asian girl?  Oh, I remember you.  You had the, uh, the little, uh, the thing there.  You had the little, uh, wooden shoes.  That was you, right?  Yeah, sure.  The little wooden shoes and I had my little rice basket.  Wait, you were bound.  You were with a white guy, right?  No.  Oh, no?  I was with, um, Ray. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, the half-shirt with the, uh...  You know, guys?  Oh, I do remember, because I know Ray used to intern for us.  Oh, Ray, yeah.  You were very pretty.  I remember, like, you woke up, and I said, did you enjoy yourself, and you went,  I have a good time!  I have a good time!  And I bowed to you, you know, with my hands folded.  Oh, we're glad you came.  So there's a reason you're calling, I assume.  You wanted to thank us for making your wrath?  Yes.  Thanks, Jimmy.  Just teasing.  You particularly. 
[02:31:30]  I know, my easy dumb jokes.  All right, Sonia, thank you.  Sorry, Sonia.  Yeah, we did stay about two, two and a half hours after the show.  We signed as many autographs as we could.  All right, let's say hi to Sonny Pirelli.  Actually, no, we'll go to Eric in Colorado first.  Hold on, Sonny.  Eric, what's up?  Eddie.  Yeah, hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey, I got a couple Bill Burr out.  On the walk over, uh, Bill, his name is Fidel Castro, not D-Del Castro.  I noticed that, too, sir, but why wreck a good joke? 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, I know.  Of course, Bill made a slight pronunciation error.  Yeah.  Well, it's not worth it.  Say what it is.  I'm stupid.  I don't know what his first name is.  Yeah, nah, you just made a little mistake.  We all make mistakes.  What, are you going to boo him now?  Yeah, sir.  No, actually, I'm going to thank Jimmy for correcting the problem.  All right, thank you, sir.  I emailed you last week, Jimmy, about the problem with the shows in Denver.  Right.  And they have been corrected.  Oh, thank you.  I'm doing Denver.  I guess they had the date screwed up, so.  All right.  Great.  Thank you, sir, for straightening that out with me. 
[02:32:30]  Godspeed.  All right.  Let's go to Sonny Ferelli.  Sonny!  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  Hey.  Yeah, I just want to, before I go into this, I want to congratulate you guys.  Fucking perfect shows, man.  I love them, man.  Thanks.  Hey, listen, on my way into Camden, I happened to hook up with Master Poe for the weekend.  Ooh, lucky boy you are.  I know it.  I know it.  And, you know, we drove in.  I was riding my motorcycle, and he was following me, and I happened to take a wrong turn to get  to the Twitter center, and we landed up in the middle of the ghetto in Camden, and, 
[02:33:00]  you know, Master Poe's like, oh, hold on.  I'll stop and get directions.  Now, here I am thinking that he's going to, like, travel somewhere out of the ghetto to  ask for directions, but the guy, like, happens to pick a package store right in the middle  of, like, the slummiest place that he could fucking find to stop, to ask for fucking directions,  and here I am.  Hold on.  I'll be right back.  He gets out of his car. 
[02:33:30]  He leaves his car running.  Here I am on my bike.  You can't hear me right now?  Fucking fuck, man.  I guarantee you there's no ending to the story.  Now, it's been a while.  These, you know, everybody's, like, looking at us, like, walking by us, like, um, you  know, um, you know, you're in the wrong neighborhood there, you know, and I'm like, uh, fuck, you  know?  Okay.  Um, when did you realize you had no ending to your story? 
[02:34:00]  No, there's more to it.  That's not it.  Oh, there's more?  Go ahead, Sonny.  No, no, no.  Um, oh, you guys.  Just try to regain focus.  Yeah, let's go.  What?  Why?  So, anyways, he gets, you know, he gets back to his car.  Does anybody remember last year?  So, he came back.  Did he at least have the accurate directions?  No, no. 
[02:34:30]  He's, like, you know, he gets back to his car and he even turns around and says, um, geez,  we happened to have parked in, like, in the worst part of the city, didn't we, Sonny?  And he says, uh, yeah, I think so.  By the way, you know, when you're, when you're telling these little stories, here's a good  idea.  Have a point.  Does anybody remember last year?  Hello, seriously. 
[02:35:00]  You know, I'd love to have Master Pokemon and have he and Sonny, because I think that  there's another side, there's two sides to every story, as cliche-loving Kenny would  say.  So, where's the drive-by when you need it?  Sonny, you still here?  Hold on, Sonny.  We want to get Poe in here.  Do we?  Yeah, we want to tie this whole story together, because apparently it's getting good.  Poe pulled over to get directions.  He went to a package store.  Now, Sonny's sitting out there all by himself.  You're right.  Poe comes out.  And we're like,  Okay, let's, let's pick it up from here, Bobby, because we, we just, what do we have 
[02:35:30]  to know what happened?  Because he's built this, like, to a feverish.  Yeah.  So, now you're in the store.  You're in the passenger seat by yourself.  Sonny's the law.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,  All right, I'll try the best I can, gentlemen.  Wow, what happened to your voice?  I had a good time all weekend. 
[02:36:00]  Jesus, what were you yelling?  Stop screaming, bitch, or I'll kill you?  Actually, I screamed about O&A Party Rock about 80,000 times.  Well, yeah.  Now you're paying the price.  Another catchphrase.  Yeah, we had a lot of fun.  I'm all about the catchphrase.  Anyway, we did get lost, and we, we, we were in the ghetto.  So, um, so instead of keep on driving and, and going deeper into the ghetto, I stopped  at a local store.  I was in my car.  He was on his motorcycle. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, Jesus.  And I went to the store, and I got directions, and the guy that I got directions from had no  teeth, but he gave me great directions.  So what?  No one's going to bother you in a bad neighborhood.  So, Sonny, I didn't know you were on a motorcycle.  No, I was on a motorcycle.  Now, that makes the story, uh, yeah.  That, so you're pelling.  You're kind of, that, that changes everything.  Well, this jungle love fever couple starts walking by me, you know, and then, and then  the black guy, he, he walks into the apartment right next to the store, and then the woman  comes walking up to me and asks me, you know, uh, if, uh, if I, if I need you to see, you 
[02:37:00]  know?  Nice.  I'm like, oh, God, what am I going to do?  Spit.  Oh!  There you go.  Take that.  Oh, behind my back.  Nice.  You wanted to know if I, you wanted to know if I wanted to play ping pong with them.  That one, that, there's a better, I'm getting good at this.  Mm-hmm.  Are volleys last a lot?  Nah, say I jinxed it.  Shit.  All right.  Oh, so you were saying?  Get the ball, dude.  Jesus.  I got it. 
[02:37:30]  So, uh.  So, anyways, and then what happened was, is that, and then what happened was.  Wow, you got some English on that.  I try.  And then, and then, and then, and then, and then he took these karate moves, and then  all of a sudden, he went pow, ping, wow, boom, boom, and he, and, you know, there was  blood all over the place, and, oh, my God, I, I'll tell you something.  I've never seen a guy fight, so.  All right, one-to-one.  I'll tell you.  What's the score?  One-one.  And I got back on my bike, and then all of a sudden, boom, boom, pow, pow, and, and, and.  Get a little bored with ping pong, though. 
[02:38:00]  Let's bowl.  Oh.  Nice.  How do you get it to curve in, Opie?  I always bowl like a straight ball.  It looks like it's going in the gutter.  It's on the rest.  It curves right in.  Do doves from Boston.  Do the, uh, the candlestick with the little ball.  Candle pin.  All right, whatever.  I never had a play.  Candle pin.  Hey, hey.  It's got to have something to do with the pilgrims. 
[02:38:30]  I'm like, you know.  It's from Boston.  And then, hey.  Shut up.  Shut up.  He rocked.  Shut up.  So, anyways, I get on my bike.  What is wrong with you?  It's a follow me, you know.  I bring nothing to the table.  He got in his car.  Shut up and sit down, you big ball fuck.  Left turn and his right turn, and, you know.  And we finally find the place, and he's, like, pointing over there. 
[02:39:00]  But then we took another long turn.  He got him deeper into the ghetto.  Now lean forward and choke yourself.  The fact that he's counting down his minutes.  And then we just took on to the end of this story.  Well, no shit.  And then after this.  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  This guy gets lost all the time.  You know, and you should have seen it.  He's just kid a little fucking mammoth.  I'm breaking your balls on you.  No matter where you're getting fucking fished.  You need to shut the fuck up.  What are these fucking times, sweetheart? 
[02:39:30]  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  Shut up, you damn asshole.  You damn asshole.  Shut your fucking mouth, you damn asshole.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Stop it.  Stop whining  Stop whining  It sucks  I hate you

[02:41:00]  One more time  No  I don't care  I don't care  Shut up  So  That's my story  It was good  Alright  That was a good one  Where's takes  The nuttion  I don't think  Sid Field  Could have told a better one  Cool  You know the guy  That's screenwriting  Oh shit  Did you like  Did you like the part  When Master Poe  Did the fucking karate moves  Or what  Alright

[03:23:00]  Caroline's all weekend long right yeah 15th 16th and 17th I think I got it wrong  I'm on my MySpace page and still have the 14th I'm not actually up in Boston  All right and your performance from Camden the tweeter center is up on YouTube  Oh yeah it's up on YouTube if you want to see me completely lose my shit for 15 minutes 
[03:23:30]  To the point of having a headache after the set for a good hour  It's being downloaded like crazy I think the link's up on Opie and Anthony.com  Legendary  If not go to YouTube throw Opie and Anthony or Bill Burr in the search  Yeah I'm hoping somebody's got a better copy of it I haven't seen it but I heard  Well I think they taped it I think there was a video  Oh there was  Yeah we'll get a nice copy of that eventually  Yeah I gotta somehow get a copy of it and if I ever get my ass to putting on a DVD I gotta 
[03:24:00]  put that shit on as extras right on  All right let's say hi to Mark Burnett  Hey Mark  Hey Mark  Hey how you doing  Mark  What's going on Mark?  I'm doing well and you?  I'm pretty good  Cool  We're watching Rockstar by the way ever since you told us to  Thanks a lot  By the way did I deliver Tommy Lee or what?  Yes you did  Yes  You're a man of your word  Now you've all made nice nice and now you can be a regular guest or whatever  You also have something coming on online soon what is that about?  Yeah Gold Rush 
[03:24:30]  You know I've had so many complaints over the years  That everyone wants to be on these reality shows and they can't  So I created a show on AOL that anybody can be on  It's called Gold Rush  And on Wednesday I'm sending 13 trucks out  Each truck is full of gold  12 trucks with $100,000 in gold  And the 13th truck has a million dollars in solid gold  The gold will be hidden all over America  East Coast, Central, West Coast, Mountain  And the clues to where that gold is will be on America Online 
[03:25:00]  AOL.com  And it's pretty simple  Mark I've got to interrupt you  So the trucks leave today?  No Wednesday morning  Wednesday morning  Can't we just follow the trucks?  You could  I'll give you the license plate number  Or is the gold already hidden and that's just a clever little ruse  You can join the dots dude  Join the dots  Well now people  How do they get the gold?  They go to AOL.com  And there's pop culture clues 
[03:25:30]  About movies, television, radio  And it's all at AOL  If you answer 13 questions correctly  The first three people  To answer the 13th question  Get plane tickets  And get flown  To the location of the gold  And go through a live  Pop culture challenge  And one of those three  Get the gold each week  So you don't get the gold  Just by doing the first thing?  No, but you don't even get a chance  Without answering these questions  But anybody can play  So it's the fairest thing I can come up with 
[03:26:00]  To give everybody a chance  To be on a reality show  Because the three first people  That answer that 13th question  Literally Mark Steiners of ET  Will call them up personally  Get them a plane ticket that day  And fly them to Vegas  Or New York or Seattle  And they'll go through  Like a half an hour  Live Survivor style challenge  But with pop culture questions  And the solid gold is right there  No BS  No waiting for your funds later  You'll get the gold  Right there and then 
[03:26:30]  Very cool, very cool  Hey, we want to talk to you  About Survivor  Obviously we're big supporters  Of what you're doing  Yep  What pissed me off  About the controversy  Is that no one  Hasn't even seen  The first show  And they're all outraged  Yeah, I know  To be honest with you  It really bothered me  A lot as well  You know  He's not only not seen  The first show  You know  That councilman in New York  Admitted  He hasn't seen  Any episode ever  Of Survivor  Oh great  John Lowe  He's an ass  We don't like him 
[03:27:00]  Yeah, and the truth is  You know  It's just dumb  To make such big statements  But I guess  You know something  Politicians in general  You know  Don't let the truth  Get in the way  Of a good story  So anything to get  Some more votes  They'll say anything  You know  Well is it true  The rumor was  That like  The problem they had  Is that all the black contestants  Had to address  The white contestants  Is yes sir  That's on your version  That's the open  Anthony version  That was  Little Jimmy Norton  Little Jimmy Norton 
[03:27:30]  That's how he wants  To see the show run  Yes  Well  I mean  Can you tell us  A little more about  No  Of course I can  But my premise was  Because you know  The truth is  This show's been on  What  It's the 13th season  You know  We've averaged around  20 million viewers  A week  So we're not  Any sort of  Problems  It's a great show  Yeah  John Lowe was saying  That yeah  The ratings were down  Some so you had  To do something crazy  But the ratings  Are doing just fine  With Survivor  Down to 17 million  Terrible  Terrible  It's an evolution of it  My premise was  That you know 
[03:28:00]  To be honest  Most people  Most people  Couldn't care less  About what race you are  In America  You have to look pretty hard  To find honest to God  Bigotry  It doesn't really exist  That much  You know  Openly  And therefore  On a desert island  When you remove  The modern world  With what car you drive  What job you've got  The way you dress  On a desert island  You'll see race  Even less  Then you add in  The fact that Survivor  Not only are they  Starving  And just trying to 
[03:28:30]  Find fish  And fire  The fact is  To get a million dollars  You need to convince  Everyone else  To vote for you  It's politics  So you don't have to  Be a complete idiot  To be openly mean  To other people  Why would they  Give you a million dollars  Hmm  I don't know  Exactly  Welfare  Are they afraid  That Asian people  Will start eating  The dogs on the island  I heard the white people  Are afraid  They're going to be  Put in big black pots 
[03:29:00]  Mark you can laugh  Come on  I am laughing  Come on  We know you have  A sense of humor  I am laughing  And you know me  And I am laughing  Because the truth is  You know  It's just humor  And you're not being mean  Right  Exactly  Exactly  And you know what  In the end  A little laughter  Goes a long way  To end the world's problems  Yeah of course  Yeah  How many people per team  There's four teams of five 
[03:29:30]  There's five on the Asian team  Five on the African American team  Five on the Caucasian team  The Hispanic team  Five  Yeah  I was waiting for the punchline  Oh no no  Oh no no  I was actually just curious  Yeah so I mean  I don't know  I think  I think you can divide the teams  Differently very very early on  And this is all just a dumb thing  That people got up in arms about  Of course  It goes longer than last year  You know  It goes way longer than last year 
[03:30:00]  And  You know  The other fact  That this councilman  In New York  Complained  Didn't even realize  Is that  The whole thing  That survivors  You get rid of someone  On your own team  Right  So all these  You know  Ethnic groups  Are getting rid of their own kind  Right  Yeah  Yeah too bad  They couldn't all vote together  Because  You know  The truth  In a term that's been on my mind  Yeah  Is that  As I said  I don't really believe  Many people  Are actually bigoted 
[03:30:30]  I think even less people  Who would sign up for a show  On national television  Are bigoted  And then you add it  In a desert island  What people get to say  To me on Friday  Is  Wow  You know  You didn't show many  Really bad  Like N words  And stuff  The truth is  If it's not on TV  I can guarantee you right now  It's not there  Because I didn't hold  Anything back  I decided  I decided to just  You know what  Go for it  And show everything  And it is what it is  Mark  Who came  What is the name  Right now  This is 
[03:31:00]  Because it's called  Cook Island  Yeah  Yeah  What is that  Is that an actual place  Or is that something  You guys knew  Oh yeah  It's an actual place  Between Hawaii and Fiji  And it was first seen  By Captain Cook  Like in the 1600s  Oh  Really  By the way  If you're only on vacation  An epic place  If you look at Survivor Tonight  There's probably never  A more beautiful  Desert island  I've ever seen  In my life  Ever  Absolutely spectacular  Great people  And it was a really good location 
[03:31:30]  It was called Cook Islands  After Captain Cook  Nice palm trees  Beaches  Yeah  And a reef  So  For a mile offshore  It never gets more than  20 feet deep  It's the beautiful  Color of green  Outside that  There's a reef  Remember the movie  Cast Away  Where there was a reef  Around the outside  He couldn't get away  Yes  Outside the reef  It's immediately  A thousand feet deep  Oh wow  So it's like  This almost purple blue color  And then you only go  10 feet  And it's 20 feet deep  Wow 
[03:32:00]  Too bad that black people  Aren't going to get to enjoy  That fine water down there  Yeah what are you going to do  About the swimming challenges  Right  Honestly  Swimmies  Everybody did well  Swimmies for the black team  Yeah they did really  Really well  In the swimming  And I think  People are smart  They know they've got  A couple of months  To prepare for Survivor  Yeah  And everybody prepared  Yeah  Now you're going to get  Huge ratings  Because of the controversy  This week  It's great  Yeah  And John Lew is obsessed  With his own ethnicity  He's obsessed with being Asian  It's all I ever hear 
[03:32:30]  Out of this guy  Is Asian nonsense  But he's giving you guys crap  For doing something  I think  It's just annoying  That he's giving you guys crap  For something that he does  Well let's hope  If indeed  A challenge to him  You know  And you guys can say it  Because you're New Yorkers  Very much so  But let's assume  He's wrong  Is he going to get  His megaphone out  On the streets  And be out there saying  I'd like to salute Survivor  Oh never  But shouldn't he  If he's wrong  And it's true  That Survivor Act 
[03:33:00]  Is good  That's how all these  Activists are though  They are so quick  To pull the trigger  But then they never  Ever  Get on when they're wrong  And  Talk about that  And he should apologize  For speaking without seeing  That'll happen  He's going to look like  A silly goose  I bet  I don't know  With that table  I think he's going to look  Like a silly goose  I don't know if we should  Humiliate people  With that language  Alright Mark 
[03:33:30]  Well we're fans man  We're happy  Thanks for getting us  Tommy Lee  Yeah yeah  Anything you want man  Take care  I love your show  Take care buddy  Thanks Mark  Thank you  Mark Burnett everyone  Survivor starts what  Thursday night  Yep  And then there's Gold Rush  I guess you go to  Goldrush.aol.com  Is it true though  The Hispanic team  By the end of the show  There are actually  Ten people on the team  I was thinking of a number  That's why I asked the numbers  I was hoping to be more  Like 20 a team  So I could say  That the Hispanic team  Will only come in one car  That's always good 
[03:34:00]  To make up facts  And then add the joke  You would have done  That's called being a phony  Let's go to swing girl  Swing girl  Ow  Sometimes I do that  When there's a sexy name  Swing girl  What does that name mean  Oh go ahead  You keep talking  I didn't mean to actually  Ask my question  What do you want it to mean  That you're going to  Hang yourself  You're back Jimmy  You're back  Or that I can get a heart on  And push you  When you're six  Get it  Swing  Waka waka

[03:38:00]  Yeah  And it was not timely anymore  Because she fucking jumped in  And I should have just let it go  But I got greedy  And tried to recapture the moment  And it didn't work  No I didn't recapture it  It fell through a big  Yeah  Would you  Would you  Would you  Can I please hear that again  Would you  Anything else there  Swing girl  Wait I have a question  Sure  Is Jimmy Schubert gonna finish out the tour  No Jimmy was only on the one show  Because he's a local boy  Philadelphia  Yeah I'm hearing that  A lot of people are gonna  Ritch to Cleveland  That's pretty cool 
[03:38:30]  That's our last date  Two weeks  I think you should give him the road trip  To see if he can come back  Yeah we know  Well the thing is  You were in Philly  But we're not sure  If we're coming back to Philly  Probably until next year  So  No but you should  Shut up  Oh god  Why could she interrupt  When you were trying to explain  That Sunday thing  I'd rather be  Sex with no wheelchair  Or glasses  I was hoping  I wasn't gonna go on  After the cancer story  I at least appreciate that 
[03:39:00]  Yeah I'd hate to have a downer  After that story  Same  Oh that woman  Got a mouth like an outboard motor  All the time  Now, let me ask you this.  Woman, married, you're both swingers.  Mm-hmm.  Do you work?  I am a stay-at-home MILF.  You're a stay-at-home MILF.  So your husband, he must have a good job, I guess? 
[03:39:30]  He does.  So you both have a nice little bank account?  Where are we going?  I'm just asking.  Do you have some money?  Uh, enough?  I kill rich cunt!  Goddamn rich cunt!  I kill rich cunt!  Goddamn rich cunt!  I kill rich cunt!  Oh, I can't believe I didn't see that coming a mile away.  I can't believe I didn't see that coming.  Goddamn rich cunt! 
[03:40:00]  That's my favorite clip ever.  I want that on my iPod.  I want to loop it and goze off to it.  I just want to snap to that.  All right, swing girl.  Take care.  She is cute, though, man.  If I didn't have a girlfriend, I would have been treating your mouth like a pocket pussy.  But I do have a girl, and I'm trying to be good.  Did you get any action?  The show was awesome, though.  Thank you.  All right, Jack.  Go ahead.  I was just trying to be loving and gentle.  I, uh...  Feel free.  What was that?  I said I was the first to perform the art of the topless for you when you came out on stage last night. 
[03:40:30]  Oh, you were all the way over by the, um...  Which side of the state?  I think the left...  I was right behind that.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I was trying to figure out.  I didn't even finish this question.  I was going to say to my right...  Well, whatever.  Just keep going.  It doesn't even matter anymore if I'm here or not.  Actually, I'll just leave.  You could fill in for me, right?  Go ahead.  How about this?  We'll start talking, and then you just carpet bomb with words.  Can I explain what happened?  I held for you guys for over an hour, and my normal phone battery died. 
[03:41:00]  Yeah, come on, guys.  And then I'm going back on my cell phone.  All right, Swing Girl, what happened at the, what, the tweeter center?  Yes, Saturday night.  What happened?  We're right behind Master...  Shut up.  I have to say, though, she was an attractive girl.  Bring Roland in.  We might have some bad news.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Where's Roland?  Does he have what we all suspect he does?  Charisma?  Charisma.  Oh, good.  Yes. 
[03:41:30]  Good, that's a rumor of that going around.  Where's Roland?  Come back ahead.  Roland, Roland, Roland.  Come on.  I saw him wandering around here.  You know what Roland does?  He meanders stupidly.  Is that what you call that?  Yeah.  A stupid meander.  Just pointless meandering.  Pointless meandering.  He actually bumps in a thing.  Is he in our office?  I saw him when we took a break.  No.  All right.  Jerry Springer campaigned ad from 1980 in which he admits spending time with a woman he shouldn't have. 
[03:42:00]  1980 he admitted that?  And that he paid her with a check.  Oh.  All right.  I love him.  We're trying to find Roland in.  I'm Jerry Springer and I want to be your governor.  Now after sharing some specific solutions for our unemployment and education problems in this state,  it looks like the nomination is finally within grasp, which makes what I'm about to tell you even more difficult.  Some nine years ago, I spent time with a woman I shouldn't have.  And I paid her with a check. 
[03:42:30]  I wish I hadn't done that.  And the truth is, I wish no one would ever know.  But in the rough world of politics, opponents are not about to let personal embarrassments lay to rest.  Perhaps like you, I'm not sure what any of this has to do with being governor.  But maybe my talking to you about this makes a point.  Ohio is in a world of hurt.  The next governor is going to have to take some heavy risks and face some hard truths.  And go to some hunkers.  I'm prepared to do that.  This commercial should be proof.  I'm not afraid, even of the truth, and even if it hurts. 
[03:43:00]  Come on.  Join me on June 8th.  We're going to turn the state around.  Jerry Springer.  That's right.  I'm a senator governor.  Be good to yourself and each other.  And pay a hooker with a check like an idiot.  Dope.  What a jerk.  Pay with a check.  With a check.  He tried to write it off under disease catching.  Fucking dope.  Where's Roland?  Roland doesn't want to come on here.  Oh, see.  Why?  We're not going to...  What? 
[03:43:30]  Where is he?  We have to...  He's in the room.  He's in...  We have to wrap this up with him.  If that's what's going to happen, we have to wrap this up.  We need some closure here.  Just want like a final...  We have to.  Just bring Roland in.  The radio show.  Jesus.  The final word.  These emails that were going back and forth over the weekend.  Unbelievable.  It's a radio show.  Here comes Roland.  Yeah, we're not...  There he is.  Hi, Roland.  Why don't you want to be on the air?  To even explain this.  What?  What?  He's all... 
[03:44:00]  Now he's completely gun shy.  What's going on?  Tell us.  I can't really...  I can't really...  It's...  It's out...  It's Friday wide.  It's out Friday wide.  What's the problem?  Well, we have to keep on continuing getting guests on the show so I can't really be on air.  Why?  You're not hurting that.  You're good on the air and you get good guests.  Yeah, and you get good guests.  You don't hurt the guests.  It works fine for, like, both things. 
[03:44:30]  It makes our show even better, which means bigger guests will be on our show.  Yeah, it's funny.  It's harmless.  It is harmless.  It's so harmless.  We're just teasing the fact that you get nervous.  What's wrong with that?  I don't know.  How did they...  How did whoever told you that that somehow would affect the job of you getting guests?  It's a long story.  That's...  We've got time.  Bonus go.  Go ahead.  I just want to know how you coming on the air and just talking about anything and getting 
[03:45:00]  nervous and, you know, the way you freeze up, why does that have anything to do with  your job booking guests?  Well, I can't talk about celebrities because that could affect the relationships I have.  That's...  Well, yeah.  Of course.  Okay, but you don't bash celebrities.  I know.  You'll ask questions to Edward Norton about, like, when does a movie come out and you get  into what...  But that's not...  You're not bashing celebrities.  No.  We don't want gossip from you.  I know, but sometimes some publicists don't like that.  Well, you know what? 
[03:45:30]  That...  But that's the way I work...  I mean...  I understand you work with them, but when you're legitimately not doing anything wrong,  I could see if you were trashing them and giving away secrets.  You know, that's...  Of course.  Yeah, whatever.  But you're not.  You're being yourself.  There's something kind of nice about that.  It's funny, but it's silly that you get nervous talking to them and people relate to it, which  is why we like it.  It's a natural human thing, and for some reason there are people, I guess, that think that's  bad.  I don't get it.  Some do. 
[03:46:00]  It's...  But they think, though.  We love Roller.  We can't lose you.  No, we can't.  We can't lose Roller.  No, we can't lose you.  We can't.  He is the greatest.  I could see if they say, look, maybe we could all talk about it, because maybe there's a  misunderstanding about what you do.  Yeah, we don't want...  We don't want your boss to get mad at us either, I mean, or you.  We don't want you to, you know...  We need guests.  ...give us gossip or anything.  But we'd like you just to talk about anything.  If we're sitting around just talking about anything, you know, to have you come in maybe 
[03:46:30]  and chime in, it'd be great.  What's bad with asking you, what do you think of all the 9-11 coverage today on TV?  I haven't seen it yet, but it's a lot.  You were made to be on radio.  It's not.  No, just...  It's a lot.  It's sad.  Yeah, it's been five years.  A lot.  And it's sad.  What's your thoughts today?  The media or all the coverage? 
[03:47:00]  Or you personally.  Just personally.  Everyone knows it's five years ago, so you start thinking about 9-11 a little more than  you usually do.  So what's going on in that big skull of yours?  I mean, um...  Lunch.  You don't have lunch?  It's lunch?  Wow.  It's a good thing to know you've kind of jumped on a patriotic bandwagon.  What do you want to eat?  A red, white, and blue hoagie?  Roland.  What do you think?  We're saying, how do you feel about the media? 
[03:47:30]  They, of course, over-exploit everything.  Like, the coverage, though.  I mean, you change it one channel to the next channel, it's going to be the same story over  and over, but different outtakes, views.  Outtakes.  Views.  Outtakes.  Like it's cannonball run.  Bloopers.  So there was an example.  Boing!  We just got you on the radio and we talked about it.  What's wrong with that?  That doesn't affect your job.  Absolutely not.  I think they were scared about you, like, doing gossip and stuff.  Maybe they were afraid you were going to embarrass the celebrities, but you don't have 
[03:48:00]  to do that.  We can go another way.  Like, did you watch football yesterday?  It's like Football Monday.  Everyone talks about football on Mondays.  I know.  I saw the U.S. Open.  The tennis.  The tennis.  What do you think?  It was a good match with Roddick and Federer.  What happened?  I mean, I don't want to explain it.  Roddick was up a match and then Federer came back and just killed him.  He can't really be up a match.  Did he kill him?  Up a set.  You can win a match or lose a match, but you can't be up a match.  He's up a set.  And still play. 
[03:48:30]  Right.  Here's a question.  Because when 9-11, they're saying, how do you feel?  I'm saying, how do you feel the country has better prepared itself to do that?  To deal with similar attacks.  How do you feel like we're better prepared now than we were back then?  Yeah.  That's a good question, Jimmy.  I guess with more security than that, I guess we're better prepared.  He's like Brando in The Dumbfather.  Well, Bill from Waterford, a lot of feedback coming in. 
[03:49:00]  Hey, Roland.  Hey, Roland.  Hey, Roland.  Let me just read this really fast.  Bill from Waterford.  Hey, Roland, what kind of lunch would you like to have today?  And which celebrity has a hidden case of AIDS?  See, that's the stuff that's going to get him in trouble.  We understand that.  What's your favorite lunch?  You're thinking about lunch, even though it's only 11.  What are you thinking of having?  Not even 11 yet.  Probably a salad. 
[03:49:30]  A salad?  There you go.  Healthy.  Like a lettuce-y salad or egg salad?  Lettuce-y salad.  Lettuce with a little dressing?  Yeah.  What do you like on your salad there?  Avocado, portobello mushrooms.  Yeah.  Simple salad?  Simple salad.  How about this?  This is something Roland could do.  In that room right there, we have some fans watching the show.  None of them are celebrities.  Maybe Roland could talk to a few of them, legitimately ask them questions, which is completely unrelated 
[03:50:00]  to anybody famous, and get to know them.  I mean, there's a role for you that if your boss is concerned about that, we'll respect  that, but there's a role for you.  Yeah, we're going to rework your role.  I like it.  I mean, just normal questions.  You don't have to ask them anything crazy or wacky.  Well, are we allowed to ask them if you saw any movies this weekend?  Of course.  That's a legit question as a person.  What did you see this weekend?  This weekend, I saw Hollywood Land.  Oh, okay.  How was it?  Really good.  You didn't see the movie with the little girl again? 
[03:50:30]  No.  Little Miss Sunshine?  No.  Little Miss Sunshine?  Well, you've seen that a few times.  Three times, yeah.  Three times, Little Miss Sunshine.  Hollywood Land was really good.  Ben Affleck was really good in the movie, and Adrian Brody.  It kind of looks like, they make him look like the guy from the old Superman TV show.  It was centered around more of Adrian Brody, not really of Ben.  Oh, so I screwed all that up.  Who played who?  Because I thought it was the other thing story.  Yeah, well.  I thought it was the Superman story. 
[03:51:00]  And the fact that he, like, supposedly killed himself.  Right.  It is.  And then the story is, Adrian Brody is an investigator to try to pop-pea-puzzle who.  Try to pop-pea-puzzle?  Yeah.  Try to pop-pea-puzzle.  Try to pop-pea-puzzle.  Why don't we, um...  Oh, God.  All right, why don't we...  That is great.  I want to see Roland, honestly, could he ask you at least one person? 
[03:51:30]  I think an interview he could do...  Bring him a young lady.  Completely.  Yeah, bring him to the door.  I could do it out there.  Well, bring him to the door.  Yeah.  Who wants to be on the radio out there?  Give me the girl in.  Yeah, get the young lady over here.  All right.  I'll just get up.  All right.  Here we go, Roland.  Now, are you going to do an interview?  This is us trying to find a new role for you.  Absolutely.  We will.  We'll get away from the celebrity gossip.  I liked the movie thing there, though, because now I'm going to go see it. 
[03:52:00]  Hang on.  Because I was on the fence there, but your description of it, poof.  What's your name?  Pop-pea-puzzle.  Heidi?  That's right.  We met her downstairs.  All right.  This is Roland, everyone.  Hello.  Hello.  So, go ahead, Roland.  Get to know our listeners.  Where are you from?  Oklahoma.  Oh.  Oklahoma, where the...  Here's a little joke.  Excuse me.  I live in Oklahoma.  I'm from California.  Let me correct that.  Okay. 
[03:52:30]  Go ahead.  Ask her now where in California.  Where in California?  Whittier.  Ah.  Ask him funnier.  L.A. County.  L.A. County.  Oh.  Don't help him.  Go ahead.  How long have you been a fan of the show?  My husband got me addicted, like, I don't know, almost a year.  How long are you visiting New York for?  Huh?  How long are you visiting New York for?  A couple more days.  Ah.  I love this way. 
[03:53:00]  Uh-oh.  He can't.  Uh-oh.  That's the one.  He's got, like, this big shit-eating grin on his face.  It's terror.  I'm sorry.  It's complete terror.  We can't lose this element of our show.  Oh, I love it.  All right.  Anything else?  Maybe a little more personal now.  What landmarks are you going to see while you're in New York?  Or?  I have no fucking clue.  I've never.  This is, like, my first time here.  Why don't you roll?  How about this?  Maybe you could suggest some things that they could do. 
[03:53:30]  Empire State Building.  Jesus.  Tourism hack.  What else?  Central Park.  Central Park.  Scary at night.  Yeah.  Got that one.  No, that's not good.  Riverside Park.  That's the third thing you think of in New York?  New York.  Riverside Park.  Where is it?  I live here.  Where is it?  I don't even know where that is. 
[03:54:00]  Jesus.  I live across the street from a third of this thing.  Oh, my God.  How about just, why don't they just come to your house?  Go ahead.  Riverside Park.  Riverside Park.  Wow, that was in the brochure.  Empire State Building.  Central Park.  Riverside Park.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.  More suggestions for her.  Some restaurants.  Some stuff that you do.  I mean, tell her.  Upper West Side.  Bars.  Yeah, like, I know where that's at.  Uh-huh, sure.  All right, let's get the Australian dude in. 
[03:54:30]  Yeah, I mean, you guys.  Thank you, Heidi.  You're good to talk to an Australian guy.  Okay, you're all right.  I want to see where he goes with this.  All right, here we go.  All right, here you go.  One more, one more, Roland.  Australian.  How you doing, mate?  Hey, how are you?  How long have you been visiting New York for?  How long will I be here?  Until the 20th.  What part of Australia are you from?  Melbourne.  Seattle.  How do you feel about the crocodile hunting?  Don't care. 
[03:55:00]  Okay.  I can see the sights while you're here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hopefully, yeah.  Yeah.  Riverside Park.  Nothing else, not the Chrysler building, not...  Yeah, that's a good one.  Cruises, not...  Yeah, the cruises are good.  Yeah?  What cruises are good?  The top of the rock.  Do you want...  Do you know anywhere where they'll cash checks from Oregon?  Yeah.  Yeah? 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  Fantastic.  Where?  The bodega check cashing place thing.  Oh, God.  Just the worst.  He is the greatest.  Oh, that makes me happy.  No wonder he goes to the movies all weekend long.  What else is there?  It's also just such tentative misinformation. 
[03:56:00]  All right.  No, but you know what?  He said some cruises.  What cruises...  You said cruises are good.  You agree.  Go ahead.  Tell them what cruises are good.  The cruise line on 42nd and 11th.  It takes you around the island.  Okay.  Awesome.  It tells you the history of New York.  Like...  Fantastic.  What were you learning?  I didn't go on it.  I just heard people went on it.  Do you know any set locations for movies like Godfather or... 
[03:56:30]  Yeah.  If you go to that 42nd and 11th, you could take a bus tour about all the movie's locations.  Okay.  Like Soprano, Sex and the City.  Where are some?  Mm-hmm.  Where are some of them?  That's cool.  Like Tavern on the Green, they film Ghostbusters.  Yep.  And then...  Somewhere they film...  Wait.  Film what?  Many more movies somewhere.  Somewhere.  I don't know.  By the map.  Somewhere they film many more movies. 
[03:57:00]  Wow.  Go to vague.com for more information.  Well, thanks very much for all the help.  Oh, you are.  Yeah.  Should we do one more?  Yeah, I think so.  Anybody else?  Want to be on the radio today?  God.  Don't be shy.  Yeah.  We got one more.  Don't help him at all.  Let's see if he can get anything done with this guy.  Here you go.  All right. 
[03:57:30]  Roland's interview.  What's your name?  John.  Where are you from?  Northern New Jersey.  I got nothing.  Are you visiting New York?  We just came in to do the walk over today.  Oh, nice.  What do you do?  What do I do?  Yeah.  For a living?  Yeah.  Uh, I'm an underwriter for a small commercial bank in New Jersey.  Exciting, huh?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:58:00]  He's from here.  I got nothing.  Um, what do you enjoy doing in the city?  No.  Um, as far as...  Um, like, seeing sites, or...  Uh, I like going to Yankee games.  I don't know.  I go to a couple of Ranger games now and again.  Concert, maybe.  Come on.  Okay.  Thank you.  No.  You won't.  No?  No, a couple more.  You're just getting to know them.  Let's go.  Delve a little more.  All right.  Are you originally from New Jersey?  Uh, yeah. 
[03:58:30]  Uh.  Um.  Did you drive in the city?  That's all you got?  What do you think?  You came over on a raft like a Cuban?  How else would he get here? 
[03:59:00]  I don't know.  Come on, Roland.  I guess I'm done here.  Let's go.  Um.  What was the last concert you saw at the Garden?  Um.  I believe it was Van Halen.  Oh.  Or the who.  I'm not sure.  I don't remember.  Okay.  Uh.  That's all I got.  Um. 
[03:59:30]  Uh.  Are you a Jets or Giants fan?  All right.  Um.  Probably a Giants fan, I'd say.  Yeah.  Did you see the game last night?  No, I didn't.  Yeah.  How do you think they're going to do this year?  Uh.  Based on their schedule, maybe about 500 or so.  Eight and eight.  No.  No.  Comment on something. 
[04:00:00]  What?  Comment on?  I mean, what's happening with you interviewing him, and your questions are valid, if not  a little stilted.  But I would say, you might want to chime in.  Like, in an interview, you talk as well as ask.  Right.  Like, you ask, and then you chime in with a little personal story of your own.  That's the help I want to give you.  Mm-hmm.  So, I mean, maybe ask him a question, chime in a little personal.  You might have told him what concert you saw.  Exactly what I was thinking about. 
[04:00:30]  In Madison Square Garden.  Yeah.  That might, like, spark, like, oh, wow, well, my last concert.  Yeah.  In Madison Square Garden.  Or maybe, uh, if he's married, things like that.  You know, personal questions, maybe.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yep.  The garden, say.  Do you want to go with the married one?  No, go with the garden.  The garden.  And, um, the last concert I saw there was, I think it was U2.  U2?  Yeah, U2.  I've got it.  Talk about it.  It was really good. 
[04:01:00]  Sing songs.  Is Bono a little preachy, or?  Sing songs.  Not too bad.  Not too bad?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Is this good?  Let's go see them.  Carl.  We're working with Roland here.  Yeah, just, just, uh, finish up the interview there.  Yeah.  Roland.  Um, have a safe drive from home. 
[04:01:30]  Thanks, Roland.  Thanks.  I was trying to, I was trying to help, uh, Roland out here.  Roland, don't look.  Yeah.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Let's say hi to Sean in Kansas.  Sean.  Hey, buddies.  Hey, Jimmy.  Long live Lucky Louie.  Thank you, buddy.  I just want to say, you guys, uh, Roland is radio gold for you guys.  As far as booking guests, he's going to pull in more people than anyone else on radio,  because they're going to have sympathy for him, because he's a waterhead. 
[04:02:00]  Roland is not a waterhead.  No?  Punching out.  Ah.  Roland, talk to him for one sec.  Talk to him.  I was calling to defend Roland, but I really can't anymore.  He's awful. 
[04:02:30]  Talk to him, Roland.  All right.  It doesn't bother me.  Hi.  Hi, Roland.  Hello.  You going to say anything?  I don't care.  I don't care.  All right, want to try another call, Roland? 
[04:03:00]  Uh, if I have to.  All right.  Let's go to Frank from Jersey.  Frank, go ahead, man.  How come, uh, Roland, why are you so nervous?  I don't know.  I just never like talking from a mic or go on camera. 
[04:03:30]  You're too worried about, like, all the millions of people listening.  You just got to relax, man.  You talk in everyday life, so why don't you just talk about something that you know?  I don't know.  What do you like to do?  I mean, come on.  Um, rollerblade.  And ice skating. 
[04:04:00]  I don't know.  Anything else?  Nah, pretty much, yeah.  Have any more questions for Roland, Frank?  I mean, he gets nervous just talking, but you don't know.  You don't have to be that nervous, man.  They're just joking with you.  I mean, you see, you could just talk about things that you know about, and, uh, you know? 
[04:04:30]  Like, what, like, what's your favorite, uh, like, you know, thing to do on vacation?  Uh, go to the beach, relax.  That's pretty much it.  Like, don't go on vacation too much.  Where's the last couple places you went?  Uh, I haven't been on vacation for, like, six years, so, the last one time was at a beach resort.  Do you like to read books? 
[04:05:00]  Me, uh, yeah.  Well?  Well, yeah.  I mean, I read books, magazines, and surf the net.  How about some titles of things you read?  Uh, Harry Potter.  There you go.  Good stuff.  Harry Potter?  I never read that.  What's that about? 
[04:05:30]  A Kid in the Broom and Flies.  Pretty much.  That's this?  Yeah.  You can rent the movies.  It's really good.  What else do you read?  Really?  Uh, that's a bad day.  Like, what night is it?  Um, like, Newsday, Us Weekly.  When was the last one you read about?  Uh, I don't know. 
[04:06:00]  Stop looking at your Blackberry, Roland.  Come on.  I...  Come on.  Wait, the last, like, Newsday, the last magazine you read, what was it about?  Um, a story about the new PlayStation 3 coming out.  Newsday?  It was, it was an article about the guy who created the chip. 
[04:06:30]  Oh, okay.  Who's that?  I can't pronounce his name.  Some dude.  Good job, Roland.  Thanks.  Go ahead, Roland.  What?  Um, yeah, he hung up. 
[04:07:00]  Good times.  All right, let's try to see if we can get another phone call going.  Another call.  Um, waiting for them to get screened.  Uh, Tony has a comment on your, uh, appearance here on the show.  Sure.  Tony from Michigan.  Go ahead, buddy.  Did my, uh, XM radio get shut off or something? 
[04:07:30]  I was listening to the Roland interview and it was just silent.  What happened?  I don't know.  Oh.  Call tech support.  You are alive.  Yep.  Oh, that's good then.  Yeah.  Hey, Roland.  Hmm?  What's Danny's last name?  I don't know.  Bonaduce.  Oh, Bonaduce.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Yeah. 
[04:08:00]  Punching out.  How do you think you did today, Roland?  I mean, uh, probably horrible.  All right.  Do you want to, uh, we're going to, all right, let's try, uh,  more.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Um, let's try this guy.  I don't know.  Big Jewish tits.  Go ahead. 
[04:08:30]  Roland.  Yeah.  How's it?  I want to, I want to help you out.  Okay.  You know, in case, uh, someone asked you later today, you know,  what can you recommend, uh, that we do tonight?  You know, they may be out of town.  You can recommend, you recommend them to come down and see my band,  lot 16 at All Leans Grocery in the Lower East Side going at seven o'clock.  There you go.  A nice specific place for people to go, Roland.  Thank you.  All Leans Grocery.  It's a happy place.  All right.  You got your plug in and there it is. 
[04:09:00]  Good job.  Uh, I guess somebody wants advice.  Fontaine.  Fontaine, go ahead, man.  Hey, Roland.  Good morning.  How are you?  Okay.  Roland, I, uh, happen to be a great fan of the show.  However, I do work in PR for a couple of high-level, high-profile folks in the entertainment industry.  I'm trying to be confidential.  But what can I expect from you to book my talent on your show?  Because, uh, on one hand, you are quite funny on the air, but I need to protect my personalities as well. 
[04:09:30]  Mean.  Um, in layman's terms, and I mean you no disrespect, I want to know, uh, if you're able to drop this blithering idiot act and book my talent and protect them, can you give me any assurances that you can handle your job well?  I haven't been doing my job for many years.  I can do my job.  I don't want to have more to say than Roland. 
[04:10:00]  I don't think that was actually somebody from the industry, Roland.  All right.  Yeah.  Let's, uh, let's wrap the show off, the show up.  How, how would you like to, how would you like to, uh, sign off, Roland?  Um, I don't know.  I just have to go to a meeting in five minutes, so, um.  Don't judge me.  Yeah, don't judge me, please.  Uh, uh, have a good day, or take care, or goodbye.  Adios.  I just have to go to a meeting. 
[04:10:30]  Oh, the virus is out.  Tell your friends.  He's infected.  That's right, O.P.  Take that, you f***ing.  Shut your mouth.  I love the homoerotic nature of the whole event.  The virus made my genitals rot off.  Whoa, dude, don't come near me.  We're your celebrity skin cancer connection.  And it was better than my first kiss.  Oh, laugh until your energy spill out on the chair.  The Anthony Show. </pre>
