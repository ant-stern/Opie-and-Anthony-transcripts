<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often in a chaotic and highly offensive manner.  The show began with the hosts discussing their transition to XM Satellite Radio and reminiscing about classic TV shows like *Cannon*, *Kojak*, *McMillan & Wife*, *Mannix*, *Barnaby Jones*, *Hawaii Five-0*, and *Baretta*, peppering their nostalgic commentary with graphic sexual descriptions and crude jokes about the shows and the actors (Robert Conrad and Robert Blake specifically mentioned).  They detailed a planned on-air stunt involving throwing cherry darts at porn stars, and a guest, Steve from FoundryMusic.com, later appeared to discuss the logistics of procuring said porn stars.  Throughout this segment, the hosts repeatedly made graphically offensive comments about Ben, a co-host absent due to illness (severe food poisoning from bad sushi).  The show also featured musical interludes and XM Radio advertisements.

The broadcast continued with a jarring shift to a recording of intellectually disabled individuals singing "The Time of My Life," immediately followed by a barrage of angry, obscenity-laden phone calls. This was followed by a banned Canadian public service announcement depicting domestic violence.  The conversation then circled back to the upcoming MiFi and cherry dart competition at the studio, and further graphic discussions of Ben's food poisoning, including detailed descriptions of vomiting and diarrhea from the hosts and callers.  A significant portion was dedicated to mocking Tom Brokaw's emotional farewell from NBC Nightly News, comparing it to *About Schmidt*, using crude imitations and jokes.  Comedian Greg Proops joined the show as a guest towards the end of this section.

Proops' appearance continued into a later segment. The discussion initially centered on Proops’ career and views on children and families, but quickly devolved into crude jokes about divorce and the Scott Peterson murder case. A James Taylor/DMX song mashup was played.  A prior segment also featured a detailed discussion of Scott Peterson's murder of his wife Laci, analyzing the case from a criminal perspective and focusing on how his own words led to his arrest.  This transitioned into a discussion of classic and modern television crime dramas (*Columbo*, *Hawaii Five-0*, *CSI*), comparing their storytelling techniques. The conversation then moved to the recent presidential election, with highly offensive commentary about George W. Bush, John Kerry, and the political climate in general.  The hosts also discussed Hollywood's perceived hypocrisy regarding the murder of a filmmaker versus a hypothetical murder related to abortion rights, along with Arnold Schwarzenegger's appearance at the Republican National Convention.  Proops shared anecdotes from his career, including his voice acting work in *Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace*, and discussed the discrepancies between perceived and actual success in Hollywood. This segment also included further objectification of female celebrities, focusing on Paris Hilton and the Olsen twins, with offensive language used throughout.

A further segment featured Proops discussing his career, including humorous remarks about child actors. The hosts contrasted the perceived effortless lives of Hollywood celebrities (using Jodie Foster and Drew Carey as examples) with the realities of everyday life; Proops jokingly offered to share Drew Carey's phone number. This led to a discussion of games and a bizarre suggestion involving Lemonheads.  A remixed audio clip of George W. Bush's speeches set to John Lennon's "Imagine" was played. The conversation shifted to the New York Yankees, and a call from Stephanie in Easton, Pennsylvania, resulted in a prolonged and explicit on-air phone sex segment, leading to Pennsylvania being declared the "sexiest state in America."  The show also included negative commentary on Robert Downey Jr.'s music CD, with clips played for the audience's criticism, and concluded with a discussion of a *South Park* episode featuring Paris Hilton, with clips from the episode aired.

Finally, a segment focused on recurring crude and misogynistic jokes about Paris Hilton, transitioning into a "What I Learned Today" listener call-in segment. Many calls included further scatological humor and jokes about Ben's bowel issues, reiterating the cherry dart and porn star segment. The show ended with the hosts expressing their perceived negativity from watching too much CNN, resulting in further offensive and vulgar commentary.

That's just too good to be true for most people.  Do you realize who you hired?  Beautiful girls, what kind of sick mind operates like that? 
[00:07:00]  What kind of sick mind operates like that?  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, and tits.  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work. 
[00:07:30]  I hate this place.  I hate this place.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  Nothing works here.  Uh-huh.  The medications don't work.  What medication does that?  I hate this place.  I've been here for seven years.  The only been here since yesterday, Brian.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I hate this place.

The medications don't work.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Today's episode, recipe for murder.  MMIV. 
[00:08:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show, act one.  Opie and Anthony Show.  Today's episode, eat, drink, and be murdered.  With special guest star, Robert Conrad.  A Quinn Martin production.  A Quinn Martin production.  Opie and Anthony, today's episode, hide and go murder. 
[00:09:00]  MMIV.  Epilogue.  We're not at the epilogue yet.  Alright, that's during what did we learn.  Yeah, the epilogue will be what did we learn.  Opie and Anthony Show.  So, today's episode, hickory dickory murder.  Oh, God.  Yeah, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America, thanks to XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:09:30]  And we want to say hi to everyone that got their XM radios turned on overnight.  Turn it on.  And by the way, you know, let's put an end to this.  We are not moving back to afternoon radio.  We did it, we kicked serious ass, and we're moving on with this new venture, okay?  People are begging us at times to move back to afternoons.  We're just not going to do it.  I'm one of those people begging, believe me.  Honestly, our lives would be a lot better.  Yeah.  But we already did that, and it just doesn't make sense when you're doing a national radio show now. 
[00:10:00]  Right.  Because, you know, we're known on the East Coast big time.  Big effing time.  But the whole West Coast is now listening to us as well, okay?  And you can't, if we're doing afternoons in the New York Times zone, you can't give the West Coast a show that's 24 hours old in the morning.  You just can't do it.  Doesn't work.  So let's stop the discussion.  We're here to stay.  We want to make this work.  Plus, we're kind of sleepy in the morning, and a lot of crazy stuff comes out.  A little punchy.  Yeah, like this freaking recipe for murder stuff. 
[00:10:30]  Opie and Anthony show.  Today's episode, stop in the name of murder.  A Quinn Martin production.  Opie and Anthony on after Cannon on CBS.  Yeah, we got in here early.  We were getting the show together and just started talking about the old TV programs. 
[00:11:00]  The old TV shows.  Don't you miss them sometimes?  I was just noticing everyone has to be beautiful on TV these days.  And we brought up Cannon for some reason, and then Kojak.  And Opie said he caddied for Telly Savalas.  I caddied for Telly Savalas, I don't even know, man.  I guess probably in the mid-80s or something like that.  Give me a putter, baby.  He came to the Huntington Crescent Club, and the guy was missing all sorts of parts off his body. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, but it didn't matter back then.  You know, supposedly he had a fake ear on the show.  Yeah, they put a fake ear on him, and it was missing like a finger or something, piece of his finger.  He was missing a couple digits.  A couple of digits?  I think so.  And I do remember seeing like no ear.  Hey, caddy, look for my ear in the woods over there.  Come on, baby.  Who loves you, baby?  Where's my golf ball?  He was playing golf and sucking on the lollipops.  Oh, his trademark lollipop.  Oh, yeah, and he would walk to his ball. 
[00:12:00]  Where's my ball, baby?  He had a big Aaron Neville mole on his cheek and stuff.  And he was like one of the hottest stars in Hollywood.  Yeah.  The guy was all over television.  Yeah.  You couldn't.  Oh, there you go.  Kojak, a Quid Martin production.  M-C-M-L-X-X-I-I.  Uh, what?  You always had to figure out what year it was.  That would be 1970-something.  Tonight's episode, recipe for murder. 
[00:12:30]  With special guest star, Charo.  Charo?  Charo.  Coochie, coochie girl.  Yeah, Kojak would walk into a nightclub and she'd be performing.  And she'd have to help Kojak find the clues.  And Kojak got all the babes, even though he was a mess.  Oh, he'd walk into some of those clubs to, like, get some info from some informant or 
[00:13:00]  something.  And the girls would come up, hey, Kojak.  And, hey, baby.  He'd be hugging him.  Like, ugh.  Like, you talk to my mole and I'm going to talk to this woman over here.  Ugh, baby.  A Quid Martin production.  They put them all out.  Mannix.  Mannix.  Oh, my God.  Mannix was the private investigator.  It was like $100 a day plus expenses.  Whoa.  Fucking expensive guy.  And Cannon.  The big fat guy, Cannon.  And the opening sequence wasn't believable. 
[00:13:30]  He's running around in the hills of California with a little six-shooter chasing some guy.  Cannon's not catching anyone.  And then, I kind of like it because he was the first guy.  He had the first portable phone.  Right.  First car phone ever.  And I thought it was the coolest thing.  And it was a phone with the little spindly cord like you'd have at home that went into  the hump in the middle of his console.  And he'd pick it up and go, mobile operator, get me Klondike 51350. 
[00:14:00]  Right away.  Right away, Mr. Cannon.  Like, he couldn't make a call.  He couldn't just dial a number.  Mobile operator.  I need 555-8383.  What was bigger, Cannon's phone or the little doggy company's satellite radios?  Oh, good question.  I have the Cannon satellite radio.  It's huge.  Oh, is that the Cannon theme? 
[00:14:30]  They'd be playing this music, and it's a whole montage of scenes on the screen of him  running, chasing, and even womanizing.  You love my fat, don't you?  Back then, you didn't have to be pretty to be on TV.  Now, you know, you've got to look like the cast of The O.C. or Smallville or something  in order to be on television.  That's why poor little Jimmy Norton doesn't get all the parts that he should get.  He's a great little actor, but perhaps, you know, people like me and Jimmy, you just 
[00:15:00]  can't get on television.  Thank you.  Yeah.  I'm not that good of an actor.  What was that other show?  We were talking, I was talking to you about it.  McMillan and Wife?  McMillan and Wife.  A Quinn Martin production.  There's a nice name.  That's the good old days, right?  McMillan and the bitch he has sex with.  Just end wife.  McMillan and the girl he's with tonight.  McMillan and still friends.  McMillan and Ex-Wife, but still on good terms. 
[00:15:30]  A Quinn Martin production.  Or Banachek.  Banachek.  What was the pitch meeting for that show?  Okay, it's going to be great.  This guy works for an insurance company.  Hold on, I've got to go backwards.  Wasn't Rock Hudson McMillan?  Yes, he was.  Gay guy.  And he was always, you know, very loving with Susan St. James, who was wife.  She played wife.  And they would solve crimes together. 
[00:16:00]  What a nightmare that would be.  What are you doing?  It probably started out.  Yeah, why aren't you home yet?  I'm working.  Why can't I come along with you?  She probably didn't believe him and had a tag along.  I'm McMillan.  I'm a cop.  I got work to do.  I'm the guy.  I'm your wife.  I'm the guy.  I should be by your side supporting you and solving crimes.  You know, one of these days you're going to turn me gay, woman. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, I'd rather have AIDS than take you along.  Oh, I do.  On tonight's episode, watch McMillan's T-cell count drop.  McMillan and wife try to track down his T-cells.  Tonight's episode, butt sex for murder.  For murder.  Murder.  Murder.  Yeah, Banachek was, what was his name?  The actor? 
[00:17:00]  I can't remember.  That would be George Pappard.  George Pappard, who later went on to the A-team.  Yes, George Pappard.  And breakfast at Tiffany's.  And breakfast at Tiffany's, yes.  George Pappard was Banachek, and the plot was he worked for an insurance company, and  he would go around trying to find missing insured stuff.  What a great show.  Always with a drink and a cigar.  And he'd put on his gloves and try to track down, like, missing boxcars and missing vases. 
[00:17:30]  That was insured for a million bucks.  My company doesn't want to pay for that.  I'm going to track it down.  I believe you had it stolen, and the whole episode is him tracking down some merchandise  that was insured by his company.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh!  Who's watching that?  Banachek.  A lot of people did back in the day.  Oh.  What about the...  Ode to a missing armoire.  MCMLXX IV. 
[00:18:00]  Is that 70...  That was made in the 1800s, I think.  How is that possible?  Banachek was made in 1880.  Me too.  We didn't even know we were going to do this today.  We just were goofing around before the show.  I loved it, though.  But when you said, recipe for murder...  Recipe for murder.  With the cheesy graphic, now it's all about Flash, you know?  You watch a TV show, the opening credits get awards now. 
[00:18:30]  Because they're all done...  It's CGI and very flashy.  That was like typewriter-written stuff superimposed on...  On bad stuff they cut out of episodes.  It was all shaky.  You know, you'd see the recipe for murder and it's shaking on the screen.  What does that say?  What?  Loved it.  Grew up watching all that Quinn Martin crap.  Let's go to gym in North Carolina.  On the streets of San Francisco.  And there's a guy called Malden who just did not belong on TV. 
[00:19:00]  Another guy that didn't belong on TV.  Big alcohol-ravaged cauliflower nose.  Oh, and then Michael Douglas was on that one.  That was his first big break before he started hitting colored people in the balls with golf balls.  And laughing about it on the golf course.  The streets of San Francisco.  Tonight's episode...  Vaggot murder.  Come on, it's San Francisco. 
[00:19:30]  MCMLXX.  Fab.  V.  V.  1975.  Running around the streets of San Francisco solving gay crime.  Cross-dressing murder.  Some of the groovy music solving gay crime.  Gay crime in San Francisco. 
[00:20:00]  Tonight's episode, Michael Douglas goes undercover in a bathhouse to find the killer of gay men.  In Get Me a Towel, I've Been Murdered.  Tonight's episode, I Left My Murder in San Francisco.  Oh, yeah.  Let's say hi to Jim in North Carolina.  Go ahead, Jim.  Hey, what's going on, Owen?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, originally from Jersey. 
[00:20:30]  I'm a Marine station down here, but glad you guys are back on the air.  Oh, cool, bro.  Hey, remember Vegas with Dan Tanna?  Yeah.  Yeah, he had a bunch of shows.  In Vegas.  What was the one where he was in Boston?  Oh, that was, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, Ben's got the, uh, uh, the squirts today, so, uh, I'll hear it now.  Our Boston connection's not here.  Spencer for hire, right, right, right, right, right.  With the black-eyed hawk.  Spencer!  Spencer for hire.  All right, thank you, Jim. 
[00:21:00]  Thanks.  Oh, yeah, Bob's got one of my old favorites.  Bob and Jamestown.  Literally, old favorites.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  Good morning to you.  Hey, Jimmy.  Hi, fella.  Hey, Barnaby Jones, you haven't mentioned it.  Barnaby Jones, that's a great pitch, too.  I'd love to be in the pitch meeting for that.  Yeah, uh, there's, how many detective shows are on now?  Uh, there's 87 on all the networks.  I got one more.  But the guy's 80 years old.  What about a detective who's 80 years old? 
[00:21:30]  What?  Yeah, Barnaby Jones.  Barnaby Jones, the geriatric gumshoe.  Tonight's episode, I'd love to catch the murderer, but my prostate's inflamed.  Barnaby Jones, M-C-M-L-X-X-B-I.  1971.  Very early in the decade, 1971.  Barnaby Jones.  Act one.  Barnaby. 
[00:22:00]  Uh, what was his son's...  Oh, he didn't have a son.  He was a nephew.  Jebediah.  Jebediah.  Jebediah Jones.  Because that was the young, because you had to get, like, a young guy in there to get  the chicks.  To get all the little hippie chicks of the day that were biting into hot dogs and screaming  because they were talking back to them.  Another guy that looked like he shouldn't be on TV.  Yeah.  You're putting an 80-year-old guy on television running around.  Another guy running around chasing young hoods.  Uh, and he's 80 years old.  Yeah.  Old guy. 
[00:22:30]  Barnaby Jones.  And the bad guys are always the same guys on all the shows.  You'd have, like, John Cassavetes or that dude from the Man for My Uncle.  Man for My Uncle.  That guy.  I forget his name.  Robert Vaughn.  Robert Vaughn.  Exactly.  Tonight's guest star, Robert Vaughn.  That's my brother Darren, by the way.  The king of useless information.  It's ridiculous what he remembers.  Hairpiece for murder starring Robert Vaughn.  Co-motiver or murder. 
[00:23:00]  I love those shows.  I can hear the murder thing all day now.  Every episode.  Just all day.  Just come up with another one.  Very original.  Oh, which one's this?  I don't know this one.  This says the girl from Uncle, not the man from Uncle.  Oh, jeez.  Ugh.  Thought I was going to hear one of the classics.  The girl on her uncle.  That stinks. 
[00:23:30]  Was that an actual TV show?  Yeah.  Barnaby Jones.  Let's go to Wayne and PA.  Tonight's episode, was it murder or did I just forget?  Wayne, what's up?  Hey, what's wrong, guys?  Hey.  Hey, you're missing one.  Don't forget the Hawaii Five-0 there.  Book them, Dano.  Yeah, that was a good one.  That was another one when they had those stupid car phones there.  It was like a receiver from a rotary phone there to jank it out the window.  Yeah, they would pull like regular phones and they'd be in their car talking on the phone. 
[00:24:00]  But as a kid, it was like, this is the coolest guy ever.  I used to think Mannix was like the coolest guy ever.  Detective, womanizing, kind of drinking, smoking, and that $100 a day plus expenses.  It's just like, God, he's raking in some heavy-duty cash.  Beginning, he's running across that bridge.  Someone's chasing him.  Not afraid to run, Mannix.  Mannix, run away for murder.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:24:30]  Real jazzy.  They'd always end up trying to get information in those lounge-like, lowly-lit clubs with the red candle on the table and the big button-tough red couches.  Let's sit down with the martini.  Spill it.  Spill it.  All right, Mannix.  Yeah, I was there, but I didn't do it, I swear.  All right, you lousy hood.  Go.  Take a walk.  He's got enough info.  Well, what time is it?  Three o'clock?  I made $100.  I could go home and go to sleep now. 
[00:25:00]  Mannix.  Barely ever worked.  He's on the job like two hours a day.  That's enough.  I'll solve the murder tomorrow on Mannix.  M-C-M-L-X-X-M-V-I.  1976?  Oh, very good.  You also had Harry O., which was like Mannix-lite.  Harry O., right.  And that was, what the hell was his name? 
[00:25:30]  David Jansen.  David Jansen.  He died early.  He probably lived a life when he was off the air.  Lived a life he was portrayed on television.  Yeah, David Jansen from The Fugitive.  Scott in Ohio.  What's up, Scott?  Hey, what about Beretta?  Yeah, well, that's kind of how we originally started talking about this before the show even started.  That's right, because Robert Blake, three years after he allegedly killed his wife, woman there, he's still in jail.  And now they're just picking a jury. 
[00:26:00]  And we were saying, what the hell happened to a speedy trial?  If this isn't a case of being denied your constitutional right to a speedy trial, three years.  And no one's talking about that.  It's not anything I read in any of the news reports.  Why can they hold this guy for three years before bringing him to trial?  Unbelievable.  Got to let him out.  Not a flight risk.  Where's he going to hide?  Where's Beretta going?  Where's old Beretta going?  Young Beretta might have fled.  Come on. 
[00:26:30]  I'm leaving with you, rummy.  You old rummy.  Yeah, that's how that started.  Yeah.  Oh, I love Beretta.  I used to watch that every week.  Keep your eye on the sparrow.  You remember that.  We're in the car.  Sammy Davis.  Yeah, babe.  Oh, Sammy sung this?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  No price on your head.  No, no. 
[00:27:00]  Should have taken the advice of his song.  When he shot his wife.  Don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  Yeah.  Get groovy.  Big Afro black people on the show.  Lie on the sparrow.  That is cockatoo.  Fred.  Fred.  Yeah.  It's narrow. 
[00:27:30]  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  MCMLXXVIIIV.  Where can I go?  Well, I'm just I-I-I.  I-I-I.  I-I-I would work, sure.  Stupid Roman numerals.  Why didn't they just put the date at the bottom of it?  All right, that ends Act 1 of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony, Act 2 coming up.  Yeah, Act 2 coming up.  We have to talk about Anthony's hair did.  Ah, I went to the, and I'm wearing a hat again today.  I understand. 
[00:28:00]  I went to sleep on it.  We'll get the full report after the break, Anthony.  Had all my hair products in.  I woke up like Ben.  You didn't wake up like Ben today.  Ben isn't in today.  Can we at least get Ben on the phone after break?  Why isn't Ben in?  He called me.  I got up at like, let's say, I was up at like 3.30 this morning, and the phone's ringing.  It's Ben saying that he's just shitting like he's never shipped before.  And he says, I would rather deal with this at home than at work. 
[00:28:30]  I'm like, yeah, whatever, dude, because we don't want to deal with it.  Is he flinging his windows open in his bathroom with that frigid cold in there?  He's sweating more than usual.  His head's sweating.  He's on the toilet.  His legs are shaking.  Stupid glasses are askew.  Poor Ben.  Awful Boston dumps.  His big hog is resting in the toilet water.  Lazily hanging in there.  Takes a nice chowder shit.  The bottom of his balls are just brushing up against the water. 
[00:29:00]  I don't know why, and I'll admit it,  but Jim and I are obsessed with Ben's hog.  We're trying to figure out what the hell's going on in the front of his pants.  We've said this many times, but for the new listeners,  we don't know if he has just really big balls or he's got just an enormous hog.  It really is.  You can't not look at it when he bobbles in the studio with his messy hair.  He's a very hairy guy, perhaps.  It's just a lot of hair. 
[00:29:30]  In a disarray, like on his head.  Ben's a mess.  Now he's crapping.  All right, hopefully we'll get to eat something, maybe, bad.  I don't know.  We'll get a Ben update, hopefully.  You got something?  No?  All right, he does it.  All right, well, after the break, we'll hopefully get Ben on the phone.  We're going to do a mash-up going into break so we could kind of regroup here.  That was a fun way to start the show today, I've got to tell you.  We'll take a com-murder break.  Yeah.  I don't think we've played this mash-up yet.  Which one?  The Beatles and Radiohead. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, I like this one.  I read the news today, oh boy  About a lucky man who made the grave  And though the news was wrong with sad  Well, I just had to laugh now 
[00:30:30]  He blew his mind out in a calm  He didn't notice that the lights had changed  A crowd of people stood and stared  They'd see you in space before  Nobody would feel joy  And even when my eyes were 
[00:31:00]  Whoa  I don't feel the pain no more 
[00:31:30]  You wish all the branches of the wall  A crowd of people turned away  But I just had to go everywhere  I love to die  I love to die 
[00:32:00]  I love to die  I love to die  I love to die  Oh boy  For I know  I love to die 
[00:32:30]  I love to die  I love to die  I love you  I love you  This is a very special show

[00:38:00]  That's going to make me laugh all day long today  Hey guys, what's up?  It's the O&A virus  Hope you're enjoying the program  We got my fives to give away  My fives  My fives  My fives  We got lots of my fives  The portable XM satellite radio  It's just an absolutely amazing thing  Selling out like crazy  I would put  I would probably put this second to the wheel  The wheel? 
[00:38:30]  As the greatest invention of all time  Are you insane?  You gotta say the wheel's better  Just because it's the wheel  But then after that, the my fives  I can't believe it took so long to invent the wheel  What were they doing before that?  I mean, you've seen all the wacky cartoons  Where, well, before the wheel  They had squares  You know what I mean?  Yeah  How stupid do you have to be  To take that long to invent the wheel?  Probably a little tough thing to come up with, you know?  It's gotta roll 
[00:39:00]  Gotta be round  The whole concept to them was just foreign  I don't think the Indians had it, right?  Of course not  They would drag stuff on a travoy  I guess they would call it  And then the wheel came over  You would think they would just look up in the sky at the moon  Or saw it and see a round thing  And like, oh, hey  Well, that's probably what happened  You know, you'd think they probably saw the moon  And decided they were gonna make a representation of it  And made it  And then, like, it fell down  And started going down the hill  And they're chasing it  Going, hey, what?  Huh?  Hey! 
[00:39:30]  Look at that sucker go  I can't even catch it  Why don't we make four of them?  And we're on a Chevy  And put an engine in it  And then drunk drive  They probably thought it just came alive, you know?  Yeah  What's that?  Fire  Yeah, the wheel  Then the MiFi  Then the MiFi  Nice  Greatest invention  Yeah, portable XM radio  Simple as that  Yes  Don't want to go into all the bells and whistles  But it's just an amazing piece of equipment  And we're giving them away  Through Christmas, I guess 
[00:40:00]  Or up to Christmas  The first one we're giving away tomorrow  We're gonna do cherry darts  With two fine porn stars  Steve from FoundryMusic.com  Bells and whistles  Oh, my God  So we don't want to talk about the bells and whistles  Of the MiFi, right? 
[00:40:30]  Thank you, Jim  I was like looking at you like  What the hell is wrong?  Oh, he's looking at me like  I'm completely insane  What got into you today?  Bells and whistles  Bells and whistles, alright  I'm on it  We're kind of awake today  This is the first show we've been awake for, I think  I'll ruin it for tomorrow  I could stay up till midnight  Screw it  Yeah  So cherry darts tomorrow  With two fine porn stars  That Steve got us  Two  Yeah, now we got two  Oh, he sent me a picture 
[00:41:00]  Of Star, I guess  Does she have XM satellite radio?  I'm hoping not  No?  In the words of Yosemite Sam  Eeeh  Eeeh  Eeeh  Ooh  Steve  He has no idea  He just walked in  Steve  Hey  Hey, what's going on, buddy?  So you got the porn stars for tomorrow's cherry darts?  Yes, I do  Martini Steve 
[00:41:30]  Martini Steve  Yes  I'm becoming very proud of my ability to conjure up porn stars at a moment's notice  Well, Anthony's not digging Star  Too bad  But the second one  The second one  Look at the second one  The second one  He just handed me the picture of the second one, Anthony  Well, you sent two pictures of Star  One was taken back in 1979  Oh, really?  And one was recent  Yeah, there's one picture  Is she an older porn star? 
[00:42:00]  No, she's in her, she's probably late 20s, 30 maybe  Is that her?  Yeah, she's an older porn star  Yeah  They're starting a lot younger now  And then here's the second one, Anthony  Let me see  Beautiful  She's coming in too, huh?  Yeah  Alright, okay  So the concept is simple  We're going to play cherry darts  We get some cherries  A little whipped cream  Porn star bends way over  And we have listeners throw the cherry darts toward the balloon knot  Nice  And they've both been fully briefed  They know exactly what's going on  And they're both cool with it 
[00:42:30]  Who's the other one?  No surprises  That young lady right in front of you  Yeah, what's her name, though?  Her name is Candy  Candy  Let me see the full length picture  Where's Star?  Let me see what we're going to do  Star is in, actually, if  He's probably in Anthony's email box right now  If he's got the photos  That's not bad  Alright  Yeah  And we're going to have 25 people try to win the MiFi tomorrow  First 25 people to show up where we broadcast  We'll have an opportunity to come up here and throw some cherry darts, okay?  25  25 
[00:43:00]  25  And do the listeners need to know anything else?  We put a little proviso in there that said if you bring food, you exponentially increase your chances of getting in  Simply because we are getting so much email  But we'll see  Alright, we'll figure it out tomorrow morning  Bring food  What's that mean?  Well, look at Steve  Yeah, exactly  Why would you say bring food?  Look, if you saw the sheer amount of email that Ben and I were getting, you'd have to put a limit on it somehow  You'd have to put some  Bring food?  Bring food?  Bring food?  I don't know  I thought I missed something  Like I missed some kind of thing we're doing 
[00:43:30]  I thought you were joking  Well, you just decided bring food  Why not?  Why not?  It's some little other thing  They don't have to bring food  Oh, fine  Alright, you don't have to  How about potato salad?  Let's make it really specific  Okay, fine  You know why, Steve?  Why?  Because then the studio would just be full of food that wouldn't go away for a while  And knowing our listeners, stupid food  Yeah, well, yeah  Canned goods and dumb stuff  No, no, no  I told them no canned goods  Great, so stuff that could just rot in the open  Well, you know, I'm assuming that we'd throw it out after the whole thing was over 
[00:44:00]  That's good  Homeless people aren't eating  Just bring it in so we can toss it in the garbage  Throw it away and we'll laugh  There you go  That's an idea  Steve might be just ahead of his time  I don't know  Maybe  Why food?  Well, yeah, I was trying to think of something that was going to at least streamline the amount of responses we were getting  Screw the streamlining  Everyone around here is getting paranoid  Simple as this  You show up, first 25 people will get to come up and throw cherry darts  I don't care if it's a madhouse outside the studio  Who cares?  It wasn't really madhouse  It was the fact  It was trying to be considerate of people that were going to be waiting out in the cold 
[00:44:30]  And that's really why  Should he tell them to bring some food to eat?  Yeah, why not?  Food!  All right!  Yeah, Brian wants to know from New Orleans if Star's last name isn't Jones  No, it is not  All right, good  Thank God  All right, well tomorrow  If you're concerned about people waiting out in the cold, you can just go stand near them  Yeah  Keep them warm  Hand on some of your hats and pants  Shoes  Yeah, they'll rub their hands over his hat 
[00:45:00]  Hopefully someone will have brought some marshmallows and they can put them on sticks and hold them over your hat  Yeah, that's right  They could  Better chance of getting in if you bring food, but not canned goods  I'm just a psychopath  You are a lunatic, man  Yeah, you know what?  I'm fucking nuts  I'm so fucking nuts  You are a kook  I really am  You really are a mess  I am  I'm happy with it  So tomorrow morning, first 25 people, is the address up on opiananthony.com?  Well, it's actually the first 25 or the first 30 with goulash  Yeah, what kind of food are you looking for? 
[00:45:30]  Goulash?  I have no idea  I just said be creative  A nice crock pot of chili  Hey, that wouldn't be bad  And then I thought he was talking about maybe giving it away to the homeless or something  Like a little holiday promotion  Bring food  Right, right, right  Because that's the only time anyone ever says bring food  Is if you're giving it to the homeless or something  Of course, I'm not that thoughtful  Yeah, I thought so  That's why I'm like, what?  Food?  All right  They'll be arguing over what's food  A guy will have vellamins  Number 26  Vellamins  Remember vellamins? 
[00:46:00]  They still sell those things?  I don't know, they were awful  Makes an 85 reference  That's why I really should hip it up a little bit  They'll be bringing Mentos  It's good to see that Jim Norton has woken up, by the way  Yeah  Welcome to the show  Hi  What was I going to say?  So, okay, tomorrow the cherry darts  First 25 people outside  You line up, whatever  And we'll see what happens  And what's the address of this joint?  111 West 57th Street  Between 6th and 7th Avenue, 5th floor  All right  Well, they don't have to worry about the 5th floor 
[00:46:30]  We'll be out there kind of making sure everything's running smoothly  So  Yeah  Just get to the front of the building  And that's that  Yes  And the address will be up on opanthony.com  It's already up there  It's already up  All right, thank you, Steve  Thank you  Well, what's going on with Ben?  He said he's going to call back in a little bit  I called him right before we came back  And he said, no, no, no, no, I can't talk now  I'll call him back in a little bit  No, we're going to talk to him when he's in this state  Yeah  Literally was in that state  I want to talk to him when he's healthy and happy  We want to talk to him as he's on the ball  Give him another call 
[00:47:00]  All right, I'll call him  Tell him to take one for the team  Tell old Crypt Keeper hair  That we want to talk to him  While he's dropping hummus into the toilet  What's a bigger mess?  What's in the toilet or on his head?  Awful hog it is  Hurricane Ben  Hey, we got a Hurricane Ben song, actually  Let me look  Let me see this real  You know where it is?  I got so much crap in front of me  You got it?  All right, hold on  Drew Boogie made this? 
[00:47:30]  Mm-hmm  This is Hurricane Ben  It's Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  Ben  You like a hurricane  That's not bad, right?  Very nice  Hey, remember Marvin from the other day?  The trucker who hated us?  Yes  Marvin  Yes, sir  Hi, Marvin  Hi, Marvin  You hated us, right?  Well, no  I just hated the show the other morning  What did you hate about the show the other morning? 
[00:48:00]  Nah, just laughing at all the stupid stuff that was going on  All right  But you're still listening  Just like we said you would be  Oh, yeah  Yeah  See, we knew it  You can't turn this off  That's the weird thing about the show  You don't know why it's good  But you can't turn it off  I know  How many times I hear from people  I hated you at first  I didn't get it  But for some reason I had to keep tuning in  And then I got hooked  That's why we call it the ONA virus  I read from people on various message boards and stuff 
[00:48:30]  And they just bash the show  They hate it  But they are the ones that can detail everything on a daily basis  And they say, oh, I can't stand it  Oh, why don't they do this a little more  Or that  And they just name bid after bid  Or segment after segment that we've done  On a daily basis  Yeah, it kind of surprised me  That y'all had a Larry Cable guy on there  Ah, that's what got him  I think Larry the Cable guy helped us out a lot  There you go  With our southern listeners 
[00:49:00]  He was stumping for us  Yes  In some of the swing states  You know what?  I didn't even laugh without the ha-haws in them  The what?  I didn't even laugh without the ha-haws in them  The ha-haws?  Yeah, remember y'all was Gilligan's Island?  Y'all don't even remember the conversation?  I think that someone said that Marvin likes Gilligan's Island  Oh, right, right, right  That was the type of stuff he liked  Oh, very good  You know, I thought that was a bad reference  When we were making fun of you 
[00:49:30]  Oh  I thought we could have done a little better  I thought it was a good one though  Because Gilligan's Island was such an awful show  I like how you say we when I said it  Yeah  That was a bad reference we said  It's like, oh no, I said it  So you're bashing my reference  No, I was taking one for the team  It was all of us  I was talking about canned laughs  Oh, okay  Like canned laughs  Let the people know when they're supposed to laugh  Yeah  Well, every sitcom has that though  Gilligan, I thought was  I have to say  I thought it was a good example  Because Gilligan to me was never funny  I despise that show  And anyone who would find that show hilarious 
[00:50:00]  Is basically a fool  But  I know one show y'all probably really enjoyed watching  What was that?  Wonder Woman  Why?  Wonder Woman?  Yeah, those big hooters  Yeah  Well, yeah, that was a good one  She was a little too old for me back then  She was one of the most beautiful women in the world, Linda Carter  I Dream of Jeannie was pretty hot too  Yeah  As far as hot broads on TV when we were growing up  She was too motherly  Wonder Woman  I don't know what happens when we start talking to Marvin  But all of a sudden I start getting a little southern in my voice 
[00:50:30]  It just slowed down a little bit  Just a little bit  Hey, Justin  Just when you thought we were all on the same page, by the way  Because we had Larry the Cable Guy in yesterday  All the red states loving us  Yeah  Wait till you hear today's guest  Yeah  The complete opposite of Larry the Cable Guy  Oh, yeah  That's the beauty of this show  It's Greg  Greg Proops  Yeah, Greg Proops will be in in about a half hour, 40 minutes  But he is as liberal as they come  Yep  Oh, yeah  So get ready to get pissed off 
[00:51:00]  Geraldo almost strangled him one time on Tough Crowd  It just got ugly  Really?  Yeah  Well, we'll see what happens with him  Very funny guy  Good morning, man  See you, Marvin  Well, Marvin, you call back any time  Okay, thank you  All right  See, people will listen to a show  And I've done this  Go ahead fast  Because I've got to go  I would say  I will listen to a show that I hate sometimes  Just because I think it stinks  And I want to hate it  And it's something to feel  Because there's nothing on that makes you feel anything  If you hate something, well, at least you hate it 
[00:51:30]  And then they wind up getting addicted to the show and loving it  That's exactly how it happens  I love getting pissed off at times  I don't know why, but I just love it  Or just going, ugh, this isn't funny  This is awful  And the next thing you know, you're like, ah, it's not bad  We've got Joe in Philly  Joe  Hey, guys, what's going on?  Hey, Joe  Yeah, since we're bringing in food tomorrow  Shouldn't we bring in a shish kebab for the roast over Steve's shoes?  Over his shoes  Steve's flaming shoes  Bring a pig with an apple in its mouth  Just have Steve put his feet under it  What, are we going to have a drum out there and start a fire 
[00:52:00]  So people can cook their food as they wait to come up here?  He really is losing his mind  He's a psychopath  Crazy person  He just brings some kind of food, but not canned goods  And he's keeping his head shaved  You know, there's a lot of scary people that work with us, by the way  Yeah  A lot of scary ones  A little frightening  A little frightening  Steve's insane  Ben can't get off the toilet with his little fat legs  Which don't even reach the floor  And our protector wants to kill us  So, you know  This show's right on track  What, Steve? 
[00:52:30]  Ah  Steve?  Eh  No, uh  Have you slept?  No  Hey, wait, you're going to come into the studio  Where's your food?  The new role in the studio  You have to bring a baked dish  You know what?  I hope 150 people show up tomorrow  I stand by what I  Stand by your food filtering method  You guys are a bunch of wimps  If you're going to work for Ant and I  Who cares if 150 people show up?  Yeah  All right  Especially if they all have casserole 
[00:53:00]  That would be interesting  We love chaos  Don't you get it?  I understand that  Okay, but  If there's a bunch of people  That want to take the chance  To come down here  Then so be it  All right, fine  Don't make something out of it  That gives a shit  Yeah  Personally, I don't think  25 people are going to show up tomorrow  Maybe they won't  Maybe they will  But, you know  It's just  When you see the sheer amount of people  That were contacting us  It's just like  How many people have contacted us?  Hundreds  Hundreds  That's good  Then we'll have hundreds of people outside  It takes me very cold 
[00:53:30]  I've been trying to be considerate  You know  With food  With food  Food will keep you  When you put an obstacle in the way  And you make it a little bit more difficult  For people to, you know  Do these kinds of things  You reduce the amount of people  That might show up  Maybe you don't  Maybe there's going to be  A hundred people showing up  With fucking donuts  Who knows?  Security  I know  You're insane  That's an obstacle?  I just want to sit here  And listen to you  An obstacle  Yeah  Show up tomorrow  Only if you can come  With a black woman  Who had her legs severed 
[00:54:00]  Due to diabetes  Right  Food  I couldn't  I was short  Whatever  Short notice  Like what?  Show up with a  Fucking 1973 Buick  I don't fucking know  You're going to show up  But you have to show up  With a pregnant woman  Who was drowned in California  If you don't have that in a bag  Don't bother coming  It's an obstacle  A little obstacle  Whittles down the crowd  What if they just bring hurdles?  If you could find  Olympic regulation hurdles  They have to hurdle over them  Down 57th Street 
[00:54:30]  Yeah Steve  It wasn't that funny  You really need to get some sleep  I do  Hurdles aren't that funny  Did you sleep last night?

I don't know  It was my older sister's magazine  So whatever it was  But in the back  It was the breast cream  To make your boobs bigger  And the girls  Weren't even topless  They had bras on  And there was a  Before and after shot  It used to just  Drive me nuts  You had to go for  The bra and panties  A lot when you were a kid 
[01:00:30]  Because the porno  Just was not available  On the computer  Like it is today  You know  You had to get it  Where you could  There were some times  Where catalogs were used  Like catalogs for panties  And bras  Never used them  We used to steal  Dirty magazines  Out of the vending machines  Well yeah  Steal them  Who was selling  Dirty magazines  In a vending machine  In the Holiday Inn  Down the street from my house  They had Penthouse  We  And I forget what  The other one was  We  Swank  Great Pia Zadora  On the cover of Wii  Pia Zadora  Of Wii Magazine  Yeah nice light fade  Pink nipples  Was that the one  Where she was in the bathtub 
[01:01:00]  I vaguely remember  It was probably like  1979  We're talking about  Before you started  Stealing the dirty magazines  Though  Yeah this was really  Early on  Where you  Very hard  It was like  Finding gold  You'd walk through  The woods sometimes  With your friends  And you'd see a pile  Of leaves  And you'd go to  Kick it  And it was like  What the  And you look  And it's a pile  Of dirty magazines  What a day that was  When you were a kid  It was just the best  Day in the world  You'd sit down  Right there in the woods  And just look at  Every picture  All afternoon long  All afternoon  And they're just

[01:08:00]  Thank you. 
[01:08:30]  Thank you. 
[01:09:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[01:09:30]  Fuck you, old buddy.  Fuck you and die.  I'm a little message for, uh, the summit workers over Crystal Plaza.  Fuck you, you dirty cocksuckers.  Like the dead end, a big fuck you to my mother-in-law.  Jesus Christ.  When I married your daughter, I agreed to support her, not the whole fucking family.  Jesus Christ.  Get the fuck off my back, you lousy fucking whore. 
[01:10:00]  Shut the fuck up before I drive all 70 feet of this Mack truck up your fat fucking ass.  I want to give a big fuck you to you guys, ONA, because I'm a cop, and all weekend long, all  I did was sing that stupid the internet is for porn song.  I'm arresting somebody, and all I want to say to them is that the internet is for porn.  See, I want to send out a big F you to that Marvin Drucker, you slow, redneck piece of shit. 
[01:10:30]  You just don't get it, do you?  No.  You want comedy?  You want to laugh all the time?  Fuck you.  Turn to 150, you dope.  Fuck you, Marvin.  Call the O.P. and Anthony F.U. line at 1-866-FU-LINE-1.  1-866-FU-LINE-1.  I'll fuck you very much.  Oh, ha, ha, ha.  Get up, get down with the sickness. 
[01:11:00]  Get up, get down with the sickness.  Get up, get down with the sickness.  Open up your head and the devil with the mate.  Get up, get down with the sickness, you mother.  Get up, get down with the sickness.  If you fuck, I get up, come on, get down with the sickness.  That sickness is stuck, it has been given to me.  Oh, it's sick, and it's called the O.A. virus spreading across America.  Ah.  Internet is for porn.  Internet is for porn.  It's wrong.  Look me up all night, hugging me. 
[01:11:30]  Horns, you corn.  Porn, porn, porn.  O.P. and Anthony Show.  Act 5.  Stop, look, and murder.  All right, Greg Probst coming in in a little while.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  He spilled my fucking cereal all over the place.  He spilled his cereal. 
[01:12:00]  He spilled his cereal.  Hey, we haven't played that in a while.  Find that for me.  Oh, where is that?  Yeah, now I'm distracted.  Now we've got to hear that Canadian PSA that was banned.  We have so many new listeners that don't even know what they're talking about.  I know. You've got to keep everyone up to speed here.  Keep everyone briefed.  This is a Canadian public service announcement.  It was against domestic violence.  And they had guys and women in public settings.  And the guy would just start abusing these women.  And the whole catch thing is, you know, you wouldn't get away with this in public. 
[01:12:30]  Why should you get away with it at home?  So here's a guy at a restaurant with his kids.  And the waitress kind of screws up with his coffee.  And he shows her who's boss.  She spilled my coffee.  I'm sorry, sir.  You fucking bitch.  I'll bring you a little coffee.  How do you like this?  You wouldn't get away with it here.  You shouldn't get away with it at home. 
[01:13:00]  It's so wrong, but it's so funny.  The laugh.  She spilled my coffee.  Like, she doesn't know what she's in for.  I'm sorry, sir, with a smile.  Like, that's all that's going to happen.  Right, right, right.  She didn't know.  He's fighting the rage when he laughs.  He just wanted to hit her right there.  Right there.  Probably a chore for him just to say that.  She spilled my coffee.  I should be beating her already.  And then he pours the, if you see the video clip, it's up on foundrymusic.com.  He pours the hot coffee all over it. 
[01:13:30]  She's screaming and then punches her in the face.  It's just awful.  But you know what?  Domestic violence is wrong.  But, I mean, there does have to be a point where I'd love to see how long it was until she spilled coffee again.  I'm not saying it's right.  Right, but I think she'll pay a little more attention to her coffee pouring skills.  Hey, someone has an idea for tomorrow.  Remember, Steve wants the first 25 people to show up with food.  With the food.  For the MiFi competition we're doing tomorrow with the Cherry Darts.  By the way, I think we're going to try to give away two MiFis tomorrow.  Stop it. 
[01:14:00]  We're going to give one away to the people that participate in the Cherry Darts competition tomorrow.  But, see, that's all local people because they're coming down to the station here in New York.  And then I think we're going to try to represent people from all over the country and you and myself and Jimmy.  Is that how they do it on Regis?  Yeah, and whoever else is around, we'll compete as well and we'll be representing some listeners from around the country.  I know when I see that done on Regis, I always feel bad if the dumb ass in the studio screws up because then the Rube doesn't get to win. 
[01:14:30]  You've got to think they're going to be mad.  Maybe we can have Ben bend over and we can all try to lob ammonium AD onto his filthy ass.  What's the update with Ben?  He still won't come on the phone?  God, he's going to be in bad shape today.  Anyway, um...  He won't come to the phone?  He'll talk to Steve, but he won't come on the air.  He's got to come on the air.  He has to.  Tell him the boss wants him.  Part of his job.  The boss said he's on the air.  He's on the air.  Down boy, what's up?  What's up?  Go ahead, let's go. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah, I was just calling in there for the first 25 there to show up dressed like Steve.  I ain't got to worry about it being cold because he'll still be nice and warm.  Dressed like Steve?  Dressed like Steve.  You could dress like Steve or a protesting Buddhist monk.  It's the same outfit.  That's not a bad idea, you know?  Extra bonus points for anyone that shows up with flaming attire.  Flaming gear.  Flaming gear.  Yes, Steve.  Ben is very, very sick. 
[01:15:30]  I just got done talking to him.  I explained to him that you'd like to get him on the air, but he said, I can't.  I can't even get out of bed.  He said it's bad sushi, he thinks.  Oh, really?  Never good.  Yeah, yeah.  He had some sushi last night.  He can't move.  Bad sushi?  Yeah, he's running to the bathroom every 10 minutes.  And Ben never gets sick, to be honest with you.  Ben never gets sick.  So if he's out, it's bad.  Is he puking or dumping?  I think it's both.  Ugh.  All right.  That's why I'm always paranoid about sushi, but everybody thinks I'm nuts.  Yeah, same. 
[01:16:00]  I know everybody, everyone I know has had bad sushi at one time or another.  I eat sushi all the time.  I got sick once, and it was because I went to one of these stupid lunch places that advertise  half-priced sushi.  Oh, dude.  It was years ago.  I learned my lesson.  Yeah.  And I brought the sushi home, and it tasted bad right away, so I stopped eating it.  So I didn't get that sick, not like a Ben.  And then I decided to try to feed it to my cats at the time, and the cats wouldn't eat it.  If the cats won't eat sushi, bad sign. 
[01:16:30]  I'm in deep ass.  Deep ass.  And were you?  Oh, yeah.  And that was just from my thing.  I think I ate one piece.  Better if I shoveled it in laughing and giggling, not thinking.  Dude, I'm fucking gossiping and having a great time.  I was with Bono, hanging out with Bono, and shoving it down his gullet.  My worst experience, I was going to the beach, Robert Moses or something, out there on Long  Island, and went to one of the delis, got myself a nice ham and Swiss on a roll with 
[01:17:00]  mustard.  Nice, right?  Ah, yeah.  And then a side order of potato salad.  Mmm, potato salad.  Nice little whatever, you know, quarter ounce or half ounce, whatever.  First of all, let me chastise you for potato salad on the beach.  Well, that's what I'm getting at.  You don't take it to the beach.  Took it to the beach.  I remember it was about 100 degrees.  Yeah, nice baking in the sun, mayonnaise, egg.  Maybe an hour or two later, I finally decide to get to my potato salad.  Good choice.  That was very, very mayonnaise-y. 
[01:17:30]  And I ate the thing.  And then I had to go out east to have dinner with my brother.  And to make a long story short, it got so bad, the diarrhea, that I was dry heaving from  my butt.  Nothing else would come out, but I was still contracting.  Like it was just opening up and puckering?  Yeah.  It was like...  Looked like a horse after they're done.  When a horse is finished, but it's still like the muscles are still going.  It must have been so bad that my body was saying, look, we don't know what's still left 
[01:18:00]  in here, but we're going to still try to get it out.  You don't think Ben has the flu, do you?  I don't think so.  He probably just ate bad sushi.  Oh, there you go.  Something to be paranoid about.  Great.  Just making sure.  Looks like grandma's lips.  Come kiss grandma.  All right.  Poor Ben.  I feel bad for the little messy-haired little guy.  The little awful body.  The little fella.  Well, let's get into some show stuff.  Glasses all askew, fogging up from the heat coming off of his body. 
[01:18:30]  He's got a bucket in his lap, puking and shitting at the same time.  That's a tough thing to do.  Yeah.  You don't know where to go.  You flip around.  Do you get the garbage bucket and sit there?  Or do you...  Do you ever puke and shit at the same time?  No.  Well, same thing happened with the potato salad.  I know some people that have.  Tell it, thank God, right next to the sink, because how else do you figure that one out?  I've heard stories of people that go to woof, they go into the toilet, and it shoots 
[01:19:00]  out on the wall behind them.  It's a hysterical image, but I wouldn't want to be there.  You just brought back a memory, man.  Geez, really?  I'm sorry to hear that.  From the frat house, we had this disgusting pig of a guy.  He was a fat guy.  I don't want to say his name.  The guy would get so hammered, and then he would have explosive diarrhea, and for some  reason he needed to sleep naked in the TV room with a blanket.  Jesus! 
[01:19:30]  And I guess...  Why didn't you tell the guy?  Knock it off!  Whatever.  He's, you know, you're in your room, whatever, whatever.  I mean, you know, these guys would come home at four or five in the morning, whatever  they want to do.  And I guess he would be so drunk, he would just take his clothes off.  Like, he had no idea what was going on.  He's one of these guys.  Yeah.  And we actually found crap on the walls, all over the couch.  Like, he had exposed...  His ass exploded, like, all over the TV room.  And instead of, like, the rest of us getting pissed off, we were just amazed. 
[01:20:00]  Like, how the F...  Just crapped all over the walls.  Yeah.  What position do you have to be in to get crap, like, I don't know, five feet up on  a wall?  And then the guy's apologizing, because he doesn't remember anything.  Of course not.  Ugh.  Pretty gruesome.  All right, well, last night was a very sad day, Anthony.  Oh, sad?  Very sad day in broadcasting.  Yes.  It was Tom Brokaw's last night.  Yeah.  Doing the NBC Nightly News. 
[01:20:30]  You gotta give it to the guy.  Pretty dignified.  I think he, uh...  I liked him the best out of the three.  No real scandals.  Peter Jennings.  Involving him.  Peter Jennings is good.  Smooth.  The liberal cunts.  Huh?  Peter Jennings is a liberal douche.  He's a Canadian.  Yeah, of course.  Well, I, you know, there's Tom right now as we talk about him.  Doing his last broadcast.  Saying goodnight for the last time.  So, uh...  He did his last broadcast last night. 
[01:21:00]  Getting a little choked up, a little serious.  It was pretty much Tom Brokaw day, uh, all day long on NBC yesterday.  On NBC.  Isn't that funny when they do, when that happens?  The other stations just don't even hit on it.  But it's the hugest news ever on Channel 4 and NBC stations.  Oh, they go in for the close-up to see his, uh, teary eyes.  Yeah.  Watch his mouth just acrobatics trying to wrap his lips around the words.  So, there was an uncomfortable moment on the Today Show yesterday morning. 
[01:21:30]  Oh, they figured they would break out the champagne.  And, uh, the Today Show, Tom started on the Today Show years ago.  He was on there.  And they figured they would, uh, give him a little toast.  A little send-off.  Mm-hmm.  And the guy starts, like, getting all choked up.  Yeah, you don't want to see that.  It's like watching your dad get all choked up.  Thank God we'll never get to that point where we know it's our last broadcast. 
[01:22:00]  No, no, we get thrown off.  Yeah, you know, we'll go out in a blaze of glory, thank God.  Because I don't want to be, like, old and have to look at Anthony for the last time and go,  This is the last time I'm going to see you.  This is the last show.  Right.  I remember when we started.  Whip him out Wednesday.  It's safe to say that'll never happen.  Nah.  We will blow this up again, and that'll be it.  That's the way to go out.  We get fired in our prime. 
[01:22:30]  You don't want anyone telling you it's over.  You just want to blow it up yourself.  Have to look at Slappy and Wappy waiting to take your seat the next day.  Yeah.  Young go-getters.  Hey, O&A, big fans, grew up listening to you guys.  It's going to be so exciting to take your places.  That's very good.  Let me give you boys some advice.  Yeah, yeah, great, great, great.  Okay, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Right, right, right.  Could you just, you know, get your seat out of here?  It smells like hemorrhoid cream.  Oh, you've got to be that guy.  It's like that movie with Jack Nicklaus. 
[01:23:00]  Jack Nicholson.  Nicholson, sorry.  No.  I just watched it last night.  About Schmidt.  Holy S.  Dude, that movie's so depressing.  I know.  That I laugh really hard.  It's horrible.  I look at that as a comedy.  It's a horrible movie.  It's hilarious.  He's retiring and his life is just like a waste.  He's retiring and they throw him the retirement dinner and they give him a stupid watch.  And the new guy, that's what it reminds me of.  The young go-getter. 
[01:23:30]  The young go-getter is waiting to take over for him.  Yeah.  And he was, you know, he was, he was the center of attention as a retirement party and everything's  great.  And then remember when he has nothing to do and he goes back to the office and he's trying  to, trying to teach the, uh, the go-getter how it's done and give him some advice.  And just like you said, the go-getter is like, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever, whatever, whatever.  Sure, sure, sure, sure.  And then he leaves the office and he sees all the files that he collected for like 20,  30 years in the dumpster.  Yep.  Dude, I laughed so freaking hard at that.  During the dumpster?  I don't remember that part. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, he walks past the, you know, he leaves the office after trying to give this new kid  some advice, how the job's done and stuff, because he has all this expertise and knowledge  that he built up over the years.  And the kid can't be bothered because I forget why.  I think he's got, you know, a lunch appointment or he's just distracted, right?  And so then, uh, Jack finally leaves the office and he sees the dumpster with his old files.  His whole body of work, everything he lived and worked for for years and years and years  amounted to garbage.  And he is being replaced and, you know, they got their ways and they don't even need his 
[01:24:30]  files.  Like, I'm sure he assumed if they came upon a problem, they could look in his files and  reference what he did and stuff.  And it just meant nothing.  Meant nothing.  It was, I laughed so hard at that movie.  Dude, when he comes home.  And the vacuum sound is going.  Exactly.  And his wife is like.  Can I explain why that movie's really funny?  Funny?  Yeah, because they're pulling at your heartstrings, okay?  I got that early on that this is going to be a brutal movie about everything going wrong 
[01:25:00]  with an older guy with his life, right?  But they pushed it to the limit that I couldn't be sad anymore.  I just started laughing.  Because you just knew what was coming.  You're like, oh, it's going to get worse than this.  Then he comes home and the vacuum cleaner's running and his wife's dead.  His wife's dead on the floor with her shoe off.  She's laying there on her stomach.  The vacuum she was using is still running.  So it's just, you hear the vacuum going.  And her feet are all askew and one shoe is hanging off.  Yeah.  Right where she just dropped dead. 
[01:25:30]  That's exactly the way you'd find somebody dead.  I love that scene too with the vacuum going.  It's just awful.  So I was with the movie and what they were trying to bring across.  But then it got so ridiculous, I took it the other way.  I'm like, now this is really funny.  Yeah.  When he takes the mobile home across the country to see his daughter who could care less about him.  I know.  And all of a sudden, you know, he's pulling up to his childhood home.  I already knew that that was just going to be something else.  He had a little smile on his face. 
[01:26:00]  He was so excited to go back to his childhood home that was there, you know, 60 years ago.  Right.  And I already knew that it was just going to be just brutal.  I started laughing.  I actually got yelled at.  There was a bunch of ladies watching the film behind me and they started yelling at me like, that's not funny.  And it turns out to be a, what, a tire store?  It's a tire store.  His old childhood home.  His old house.  Where he has all his memories.  He's like, and it wasn't, there wasn't even a hint that a house had been there.  It's like a tire store and a big parking lot around it.  Wasn't he in the middle of the tire store going, this is about where my bedroom was or something like that? 
[01:26:30]  He goes, I grew up here.  Right.  And the guy goes, yeah, whatever, dude.  Tire store?  You want some radials?  And he's like, yep.  Yeah, no one cared about him at all.  You know, that's one of those movies, it wasn't supposed to be a comedy, but they took it so far that I couldn't help but laugh.  Couldn't help but laugh.  That horrific scene that got all the publicity was, what's her face?  Kathy Bates being naked.  Kathy Bates.  Kathy Bates getting into the hot tub.  Yeah.  Wow.  What a world of hurt.  Yeah, that was a little rough.  I think she's showing up tomorrow for a cherry darts.  I think Steve booked it. 
[01:27:00]  Did you like that movie, though?  No.  It was one of those movies that was just kind of on.  And then I was looking over my shoulder as I was playing EverQuest 2 and kind of paying attention to it.  It just ends kind of.  Yeah.  I go to movies like Tuesday afternoons with the old ladies.  That's what they do, I guess, on Tuesdays.  And I was leaving the movie theater just going, man, that was a great comedy.  I swear to God.  It was a very depressing movie.  It was depressing.  Well, I'll explain it. 
[01:27:30]  So then walking out and the old ladies are just pissed off.  Like, I thought that was supposed to be a comedy.  And I'm saying to myself, it was for me.  They thought it was supposed to be a comedy?  Yeah, because I guess the coming attractions for that movie, they showed all the kind of funny moments.  Oh, ha-ha.  No, there were funny moments in the movie, and they strung those together.  And we were talking about this yesterday, how they market movies in a weird way.  And so they market that movie like it was kind of a dark comedy.  Yeah.  And it certainly wasn't.  Well, I got it confused.  Funny you say that. 
[01:28:00]  I got the movie confused with that other movie that came out with Jack Nicholson.  Dude, I've been making that mistake my whole life.  And every time I'm thinking of the actor or the golfer, I have to, like, consciously think of his name.  What was the comedy he was just in?  Don't tell me that awful one with him and the girl.  That wasn't that bad.  They really scream at each other.  They both see each other naked.  With Kay Corleone.  Not as good as it gets.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With Diane Keaton. 
[01:28:30]  Diane Keaton.  That wasn't that bad.  I didn't see it.  But I thought, now, last night, I thought that's what was on.  I thought that was the movie.  Oh, okay.  So as I'm watching it, I'm waiting for the funny.  And, you know, there he is retiring.  And his life is in the garbage.  And his wife is dead on the floor.  I'm like, wait.  Is this the movie with Diane Keaton?  What's the name of that movie?  As good as it gets?  No, no, no.  That's the Oscar winner.  Something's Gotta Give.  Thank you.  Something's Gotta Give.  Yeah, Something's Gotta Give.  Like, that would happen in real life. 
[01:29:00]  He'd blow off the hot piece of ass for the old hag.  I mean, no offense to the older ladies out there.  That ain't happening ever.  It ain't gonna happen.  So.  Hi, Steve.  What were we talking about?  Oh, so Tom Brokaw.  Oh, yes.  His little send-off on the Today Show.  And he got a little choked up.  And it was kind of hard to watch.  You got a little clip?  Yeah, no, I was being handed a note.  Yeah, so he was on the Today Show with everybody around him.  Giving him a send-off.  Before his last broadcast, by the way. 
[01:29:30]  We'll leave you now with Tom Brokaw's goodbye.  He stopped by the Today Show this morning.  And Katie, Matt, and the gang toasted Tom.  Very special.  It's from a song, but nobody does it better, and no one ever has Tom.  Well, it's very sweet.  It's been a great, great privilege.  Thank you.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Congratulations and all the best.  That's just awful. 
[01:30:00]  Who wants to see that?  He really cried.  I thought he just, like, stopped himself.  Oh, no.  He couldn't even talk.  He was so choked up.  It's great.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Cheers.  Drink up, everybody.  I'm fucking cocked.  I get a little emotional.  I love champagne.  The bubbles tickle my nose.  All right.  Guys, can I have one more week, please? 
[01:30:30]  I don't want to go.  It's like Jack Nicholson.  I mean, Nicholas.  I mean, in that movie.  It's like seeing your dad cry.  You don't want to see your dad cry ever.  Oh, you never want to see that.  Oh, you never want to see that.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Tom broke on NBC Nightly.  So then we got his final words on NBC Nightly News. 
[01:31:00]  This was his send-off last night.  Well, the time is here.  We've been through a lot together through dark days and nights and seasons of hope and joy.  Whatever the story, I had only one objective, to get it right.  When I failed, it was personally painful and there was no greater urgency than course correction.  On those occasions, I was grateful for your forbearance and always mindful that your patience and attentions didn't come with a lifetime warranty. 
[01:31:30]  I was not alone here, of course.  I am simply the most conspicuous part of a large, thoroughly dedicated and professional staff that extends from just beyond these cameras across the country and around the world.  In too many instances and places of grave danger and personal hardship.  And they're family to me.  What have I learned here?  However, more than we have time to recount this evening, but the enduring lessons through the decades are these. 
[01:32:00]  It's not the questions that get us in trouble.  It's the answers.  And just as important, no one person has all the answers.  Just ask a member of the generation that I came to know well, the men and women who came of age in the Great Depression,  who had great personal sacrifice, saved the world in World War II,  and returned home to dedicate their lives to improving the nation they had already served so nobly.  They weren't perfect.  No generation is.  But this one left a large and vital legacy of common effort to find common ground here and abroad in which to solve our most vexing problems. 
[01:32:30]  They did not give up their personal beliefs and greatest passions, but they never stopped learning from each other.  And most of all, they did not give up on the idea that we're all in this together.  We still are.  And it is in that spirit that I say thanks for all that I have learned from you.  That's been my richest reward.  That's Nightly News for this Wednesday night.  I'm Tom Brokaw.  You'll see Brian Williams here tomorrow night. 
[01:33:00]  And I'll see you along the way.  So thanks for the night.  All right, Tom, thanks.  That was great.  No, I really want to see you.  Come on, Tom.  You've got to go.  No.  Take his mic off.  I'm not giving up my...  Take his mic off.  Get him out of the seat.  We've got to get him out of here.  Come on.  Turn the music off.  I'm staying.  Come on.  Brian Williams is waiting in the way.  You've got to go, Tom.  I don't want to go.  Go get your mobile home.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Give me another week.  Look, I'm not retired.  Go.  I don't want to retire anymore. 
[01:33:30]  I don't want to retire anymore.  Please, can I stay just a little while?  I want to stay.  I want to stay.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  Take a motorhome to see my daughter?  Have my Hummels fall off the roof as I drive away with the candles sliding?  Find my wife, Jen, with a vacuum cleaner going and her shoe slightly askew?  What a horrible day that'll be.  I just want to stay here on NBC Nightly and lose. 
[01:34:00]  Come on.  Who wants me to stay?  Raise your hand.  Come on.  Put your hands up, guys.  Look at the TV.  They already got the new commercials for Brian Williams.  You're yesterday's news.  Yesterday, you're drinking champagne.  Today, they got the new commercials on TV.  Ain't life a bitch.  I walked out back yesterday and I saw my segment I did on the Berlin Wall coming down in the dumpster. 
[01:34:30]  It was horrible.  All my work.  All the work I put into it.  My touching tribute to the brave souls that lost their lives on the Challenger.  It was sitting there on banana peels and garbage juice.  I pulled Brian Williams aside and told him, there is no greater thing than to be a communicator to the...  And he was like, yeah, whatever.  Whatever, Tom.  My seat now.  I was there getting my mic turned off by Opie. 
[01:35:00]  No, I didn't do that one.  But it is time for you to go.  So maybe that made sense there.  Please, just a little bit longer.  Oh, please stay, Tom Brokaw, just a little bit longer.  We want to do the news just a little bit more.  And if Brian Williams can go fuck himself, then I'll stay a little longer. 
[01:35:30]  No?  No, it's over, Tom.  I'm sorry.  We already have the commercials running for Brian Williams.  You're done.  Wear the old fishing hat.  Talk about balloons by the lake.  What am I supposed to do?  I was in the woods and I got lost.  I was so scared.  What the hell am I supposed to do?  That's for you to figure out.  Walk around. 
[01:36:00]  Maybe I can get the Tom Brokaw Little Rascal Scooter.  That'll be dignified.  After being the great newscaster for so many years, there I'll be.  Oh, let me turn the lights on.  This is a great life I have now.  Listen to the old bags screaming all the time.  There I was on top of the Berlin Wall as it came down.  And now I'm hearing, Tom, time to take out the garbage. 
[01:36:30]  It's your turn.  She has no clue what I went through.  There I was, the end of an era of the communists in Russia.  Yeah, you were there when they took down the Berlin Wall.  Came down.  Remember the shot of me giving the news as the big heavy hammers were coming down on the Berlin Wall?  Remember that?  Yeah, you had a lot of youth back then.  Now I get, put the goddamn seat down, Tom. 
[01:37:00]  I like the toilet paper coming out under the wall, not over the top.  Like it makes a difference.  What?  Like it makes a difference.  Sometimes I have trouble catching my breath.  I don't know why.  Like it makes a difference.  Tom, you have no place else to go.  I have no place else to go.  I have no place else. 
[01:37:30]  Don't you do that.  Don't you do that.  Could remind you of your lines, Tom.  Now that you're older.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Tommy.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Tommy.  Don't you do it.  Don't you do it.  Don't you.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  What do I have? 
[01:38:00]  What do I have?  I've got nothing else.  You have nothing else, Tom.  Except a gerbil and his asshole.  Allegedly.  That old gag.  It's done.  You're finally done there, Tom.  I'm done.  I'm going to have to take some time and sit.  I agree to do other stories for NBC, though,  and I'm sure they'll really pay a lot of attention to that  and give it a lot of time.  Of course they will.  I want to do my documentary on the Whippoorwill.  I'm sure they'll just promote the shit out of that one. 
[01:38:30]  Opie and Anthony get more promotion on XM  than I will get on NBC News.  Tom, you sound a little woozy today.  Were you celebrating last night?  Sharing some campaign with Katie Courant.  Yeah.  Sounds like you overindulged last night after the last broadcast.  Actually, I was hanging out at a downtown Manhattan bar  with your own Ben's Parks.  Oh, that's why Ben's not here.  Yes.  We were tying one on.  I had a little bit of bed.  Sushi. 
[01:39:00]  I had a little bit of bed.  You know, Tom, there's one thing I want to ask you.  You know, you don't have to answer to anyone anymore,  and you seem a little woozy.  This is true.  How do you really feel, just in general?  Well, I might as well put a bullet in my head.  I'd rather be on NBC Nightly News, but I was pushed out.  I actually didn't retire.  At least I don't have to leave in disgrace.  Well, how do you feel about your colleagues?  How do you feel about Katie Couric? 
[01:39:30]  Katie Couric?  Yeah.  Her best segment was when they were snaking a tube up her ass live on television  for her asshole check-up.  It was lovely.  They really showed her best side.  You thought that was pretty ridiculous, right?  Yeah, that was kind of ridiculous.  I would never do that.  What about Matt Lauer?  You don't have to hold back anymore.  Matt Lauer.  Matt Lauer.  Yeah.  Matt Lauer.  Lauer.  Lauer.  Two words. 
[01:40:00]  Faggot.  That's what I think about that.  Yeah, you can say that now.  I liked the colored guy when he was a little more rotund.  Yeah?  Yeah, what the hell is his name?  Al Roker?  Al Roker.  Al Roker.  You like the fat version of Al Roker?  I like the fat, jolly Al Roker.  The skinnier he gets, the more threatening he gets to me.  I don't know why that is.  I like the hey, hey, hey version. 
[01:40:30]  A little better.  Like I walk up to him and go, hey, hey, hey.  He'd go.  All right, well.  I want to wish you luck there, Tom.  Thank you.  Like I'm really talking to Tom.  Here I am.  Now signing off.  Yeah, for the last time.  For the last time.  Oh, please.  You know, I'll be back on this program.  Half the impressions died.  You think I'm going to let this one go?  Yeah, exactly.  Not for a second. 
[01:41:00]  All right, Tom.  Do a whole retrospective and listen to me say words like Achilles Loro.  Achilles Loro.  A what?  Where they threw poor Leon's king.  The terrorist abuaba.  Throwing cookies off on the deck.  JFK Jr., remember my report when he went down?  Oh, yeah.  And they took the Navy ship grasp.  Right.  And tried to find his body and that of his nagging wife that killed him. 
[01:41:30]  If the bitch only would have gotten off the cell phone and kept her yap shut, perhaps he would have landed.  Don't mind me.  I'm just watching television.  Tom?  Yes.  Oh, I was a little woozy again.  It's time.  I'm nodding off.  I've been up late.  It's time for your final words.  You know what they have to be.  Is it NBC Nightly News?  No.  Is this?  It's the last words. 
[01:42:00]  Is this courage?  It's the last words Anthony and I and Jim Norton said.  Is it, what's the frequency, Kenneth?  When we got canceled.  I'm going to laugh.  Beat the shit out of that idiot.  At WNEW.  You do know what you have to say.  Yes, I do.  Tom Brokaw, your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  I wish we had the Hulk walking away music as you said that.  That would be nice, but.  We're here at St. Pat's and we're doing the balloon knot.  No?  No.  Can't use that line. 
[01:42:30]  What the hell is that?  I know it's here somewhere.  Press a button.  Pull a chain.  How come the Hulk is?  There it is, Tom.  There it is.  Your mom's box.  It's time to go, Tom.  I say these words.  Your mom's box.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Wait.  Wait, now that was your final words.  It has to be your mom's box.  Your mom's box. 
[01:43:00]  Okay, goodbye.  All right, bye.  Your mom's box.  No, your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  Say goodbye, then your mom's box.  Your mom's box, goodbye.  No, the other way.  Who's on first?  Your final words have to be your mom's box.  Your mom's box.  NBC Nightly News.  You can ask.  All right.  Turn in tomorrow when some young fuck will be in my seat.  That's right.  Your mom's box. 
[01:43:30]  All right.  Bye, Tom.  Nightly News.  All right.  Thank you.  Your mom's box.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Greg Proops is here.  We'll be talking to him next, Anthony.  Yes.  Hey, what's up, man?  I'm back.  Hey, how are you?  Your mom's box.  As we go to break here, Brother Joe, he's here too, right?  Sure.  We're getting a request for his James Taylor Party Up In Here song.  Who doesn't love that one?  An imitation of James Taylor doing the DMX song Up In Here.  James Taylor. 
[01:44:00]  That's what I said, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, check this out, and we'll get Greg.  Oh, he's waving because there's a delay.  That was hilarious.  He started waving.  Greg Proops is next.  We'll be right back. 
[01:44:30]  Up In Here.  Up In Here.  If I've got stuff, bring it to you cowards.  Then it's gonna be quick.  All right.  All you men's up in the jail before.  Suck my dick.  And all them other cats you run with.  Get done with them quick. 
[01:45:00]  How the fuck you gonna cross the dog with some bum shit?  All right.  All right.  There go the gun clip.  Nine-one-one shit.  All over some dumb shit.  Ain't that some shit?  Y'all niggas remind me of a strip club.  Cause every time you come around, it's like what? 
[01:45:30]  I just gotta get my dick sucked.  And I don't know who the fuck you think you're talking to.  But I'm not in Iceland.  So watch what you do while you go.  Find yourself very next to someone else.  And we all thought you'd love yourself.  But that couldn't have been the issue.  Oh, maybe they just saying that. 
[01:46:00]  Now costing them this.  You shit, a nigga tried to diss you.  That's why you're laying on your back.  Looking at the roof of the church.  Preacher telling the truth.  And you know that it hurts.  Yeah.  Whoa, y'all gon' make me lose my mind  Up in here, up in here  Y'all gon' make me go on

If people spell their name however they want, it has nothing to do with phonics or nothing.  I'm not sure what phonics is, but I saw the girl that was hooked on it.  She's got a problem with it, apparently.  Have you seen that commercial?  Hooked on phonics! Work for me! 
[01:48:30]  She was adorable, you know.  I was thinking, wouldn't that be weird if she was applying what she learned and she couldn't get the commercial straight, you know?  Hook it on phonics!  Working for me!  Hook it on phonics!  Working for me!  Me!  Okay, cut.  You talk to her, mate. 
[01:49:00]  We ain't gonna move a lot of tapes this way.  I'm telling you right now.  Anyway, I met this woman.  Her name was, uh, Amy.  You know, so I go, oh, uh, A-M-Y?  She goes, no.  A-Y-M-I-E.  Oh.  I have to take a nap.  I'm Brian.  B-R-I-V-O-L-B-N.  The number's stuck in the letter.  Q!  B-R-I-V-O-L-B-N-G!  Look at my name tag. 
[01:49:30]  It's big.  You know, I started out in showbiz, uh, in about 19, really, I say 46, but actually  it was 1944, when my front yard, uh, my grandfather bought me a cowboy uniform.  And, uh, they told me, don't slip in a dog poo-poo.  And I did.  And I just kept slipping in it and falling, and they just laughed. 
[01:50:00]  It was beautiful.  And that was my first comedy routine.  And I've just been slipping in shit ever since.  We've made it even easier for you to give XM.

Staring at my shoes.  Trying to think of something.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  The Freak Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  And the science is all here. 
[01:51:00]  Freaky people need y'all to fly.  And the science is all here.  Freaky people need y'all to fly.  And the science is all here.  Freaky people need y'all to fly.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony Show.  Act 6.  That's a crock of murder. 
[01:51:30]  Greg Proofs is looking at us like, what?  In studio, Greg Proofs playing Carolines all this weekend in New York City.  Tonight, just a ton of shows.  Call 212-757-4100 for reservations.  All right?  All right.  I will.  Good morning, y'all.  Hi, Greg.  How are you guys doing?  We were talking about the old TV shows.  Yeah.  And everything was like a recipe for murder.  A Quentin Martin production.  Yeah, right.  Recipe for murder.  Prologue.  Prologue.  And then epilogue at the end. 
[01:52:00]  And you're like, what's an epilogue?  Why are we using the Greek unities?  It's a TV show about an old man with a horse as a partner.  Tonight's episode, soup can full of death.  Yeah, that's exactly what we were talking about.  You know, somberly intoned.  Yeah.  Streets of San Francisco always had this.  Yeah, yeah.  That was one of my favorites.  And then the epilogue was the wrap-up where they kind of had the little laugh at the end.  Yeah.  Everything was fine.  They caught whoever they had to catch.  The prostitute is now making something of herself. 
[01:52:30]  Right.  Right, right.  Now she's a housewife.  These cookies are from Brandy.  Michael Douglas got his test back after doing undercover at the bathhouse, and he was negative.  Epilogue.  T-cell count's still high.  Yeah.  All right.  Great to be here.  I know.  I was just thinking of something.  We had Larry the Cable Guy in yesterday.  Terrific.  And now we're doing a national radio show now. 
[01:53:00]  They loved Larry the Cable Guy.  And now everyone thinks we're in tune with each other, the truckers and the southerners.  And I'm like, just wait till you hear great proofs tomorrow.  Oh.  The polar opposite of Larry the Cable Guy.  I think they're a little different politically.  Which is fine.  Politically, yeah.  But I think comedically, golly, we're all there to make people happy.  And is there any greater gift than laughter?  Other than the striking of a small child for misbehaving?  I don't think there's any greater gift than that.  Larry and I are not working the same patch of ground.  So there's very little likelihood that we're in competition with one another. 
[01:53:30]  And I wish him all the best.  I understand he's extraordinarily good at his gig.  And he's a tremendous marketer.  I only wish I had that kind of business acumen.  I couldn't sell anything.  No?  No, I couldn't sell ice to people on fire.  So it's a...  You don't have any products you sell?  Nothing?  No, I'm going to have a CD later.  But by the time I put it out, the material on it, I'm like, hey, that Billy Carter.  What a jerk, you know?  Gosh, this Falklands War. 
[01:54:00]  When will that be over?  So I really got to jump on stuff a little sooner.  Well, that's what sucks if you do topical humor.  You can't really get the CDs out there.  No, you've got to be immediate with that jazz.  But so, you know, I will, though.  Like, I'm threatening to have a CD on my website.  I know people like to buy stuff, and that's an important part of business.  Yeah, you should do that.  But I'm just learning that.  I'm just learning that basic tenet.  Most comics are really lazy, though.  Like, he seemed to be a go-getter.  Oh, totally.  Like, he's pushing.  He's always making calls to radio stations, really pushing himself. 
[01:54:30]  I do believe he's a whore, is what he is.  There you go.  But comics, usually pretty lazy.  The lifestyle they lead is stay up late, sleep late, try to anyway, Jimmy.  Works for me.  Yeah.  What did Seinfeld say?  He said when he was doing the show that they would have comedians come in.  So there's a difference between actors and comedians.  When actors showed up for the audition, it was like the thing they'd be waiting for all  week.  And comedians always just act like you're fucking ruining their day by getting up early.  That's so true, man.  My buddy always says, like, I've been on, I'm sure you have, you do part on a sitcom 
[01:55:00]  or whatever, but, like, people go, so you're an actor, Greg?  And I'm like, no, not really, because that would require me focusing for 30 whole minutes  on something as opposed to thinking about what I want to say next and how I can be a  smartass.  It's like, and the idea of, like, hi, I am from France, and I'm wearing a mustache.  Quick, get the bullets!  No, it's not going to, I don't think I could really handle that.  No.  If it was close to my character, I could do it.  Do you like acting, though? 
[01:55:30]  I do, because, but you know what?  Because it's scary.  It's scary.  I mean, in sitcoms, I'm usually the snipey guy, surprisingly.  Sure.  Or some sort of snide gay guy that comes in.  These are the parts I've played over and over.  Simply because I sound and look this way.  That's 90% of acting, though.  People think acting is like this difficult mountain journey or something, and actors make  you think, we had to go to Fiji for two weeks and learn how to do kung fu?  Hey, blow me!  You ever have your boss drill up your butt like an armadillo for weeks at a time? 
[01:56:00]  That's acting.  You know, to pretend like you need to be where you need to be.  Anyone in the world would want to be an actor.  They rub your legs, they give you donuts.  Acting's cake.  Total cake.  And anyone who makes it in that profession has to admit how lucky they are, because it  is ridiculously easy.  Anyone can act if you just stick them in front of them.  I mean, not anyone.  We've proved that.  But you know what I mean?  Like, I just can't believe it when actors go, it's really hard.  I had to gain weight and grow my hair.  And hey, dude, you ever have your mother come over to your house? 
[01:56:30]  You ever not be able to get it up for like weeks at a time?  That's acting.  Not in the vernal equinox.  It's the moon or something.  Someone's going to call us out on something.  We'll let him have his moment here.  Rob, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I think Greg is like a really funny guy.  I like who's on his anyway, but you guys bash like improv comedy all the time.  I'm surprised you have him on the show today.  No, we bash, not improv comedy, dude.  Bad improv comedy.  99% of improv comedy stinks. 
[01:57:00]  It's the same old jazz.  So you've seen my show.  No, if improv comedy is done well, it's unbelievable.  It's like anything else, but you just see more bad improv comedy than you do good improv comedy.  I'm not going to lie.  I wasn't a fan of Whose Line Is It Anyway, but I saw you at the Montreal Comedy Festival.  I laughed my ass off.  I mean, his stand-up is unbelievable.  The improv stuff is just not my cup of tea.  That's all.  You're a chicken who works in a deli.  Go.  What?  No.  Oh, I love that one.  He loves doing that one, though.  To be honest, it's been my weekend job for 14 years. 
[01:57:30]  Really?  I've done improv since college, yeah, but mostly I consider myself a stand-up.  I've been extremely fortunate to fall into that, and it just carried on way past the sell-by date that I ever thought I'd be.  Yeah.  And now, you know, hey, right on.  It's been a whole career, so people like it.  You know who likes it?  Families, and that's why you guys, because of your bitter, dark, cynical, horrible, shriveled, spaced-out souls, like some sort of piece of Jetsam flying across the universe that's been exposed to solar winds and had all kind of humanity banged out of it by the radiation of the universe. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, this is not a family show.  All right.  We hate family.  Yeah, I know.  Dude, I'm down with you.  I don't have kids either.  You know, but I just, it surprised me, but it's been, families really like it, because they can watch it together, and you don't have to explain, like, hey, how come this person's not screwing over this person for a million dollars on the island, and mother, what's velatio?  You know, those questions never come up.  Instead, it's why are 40-year-old men acting gay all the time with each other? 
[01:58:30]  Someone described the show once as a bunch of assholes playing charades, and I thought that was the funniest.  My favorite one was on an English website about improv.  Why not prepare something funny?  Prepare, yeah.  You want to hone that improv?  It was perfect.  Yeah, you know, if given a chance, I would write something, but, you know, they don't give you a chance. 
[01:59:00]  Golly.  So what do you not like about kids?  You just don't like the kids?  I like kids.  I just don't have any kids.  But people, there's this mandate in America that somehow you're supposed to breed if capable, and I don't get that, you know.  I'm happy I'm married.  I don't, we don't want kids, and that's the end of it, you know, and people go, but why?  It's like, because I don't want to be like you.  You know what it is?  Yeah, it's the people, they end up, it's like sleeping next to the bean pod in Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  They were like us. 
[01:59:30]  They didn't want kids, and then all of a sudden they have kids,  and it's like, it's the most wonderful thing.  Here, you want, you need kids too.  Fall asleep next to the bean pod, and wake up, and you'll have kids, and then you'll be spreading this around.  What is it?  Johnson & Johnson has a commercial out now.  It's like, after you have kids, everything changes.  And they had a guy that used to, I guess, read Playboy or something, and now he's reading his children some books.  Can you imagine?  He used to get up in the middle of the night.  He used to drink at 7 in the morning, golly. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, it looks like a big inconvenience, and I cannot be inconvenienced.  Exactly, I'm too selfish.  I'm sure it's profound and wonderful.  I have nothing against children.  I couldn't eat a whole one.  I'll split one with you.  But, yeah, I just, I can't stand the pressure.  Like, you're not normal if you don't have kids.  It's like, whatever.  So, you know, I'm unto a, hey, do what you want to do.  Yeah, isn't it fun to be able to just pick up and go somewhere if you want to?  Well, I've found it to be quite fun over the last 15 years, yeah.  Just get up and go.  You don't have to call a babysitter or drag some overgrown fetus and equipment with you. 
[02:00:30]  They all got the equipment.  Somebody can't just, a guy that has a kid, used to be a friend of yours, can't just come over the house anymore.  It's not just like, drop by, have a few beers, watch some TV, and have some laughs.  All of a sudden, the SUV pulls up with just crates of crap that now goes all over the floor.  And you need to put the baby in it and take the baby out.  Now, shove this in his mouth.  Oh, he's crying.  Put this in there.  Grab this.  Joe, it smells like shit.  Change the diaper.  Get this. 
[02:01:00]  And I want no part of it.  And they always joke, hey, you want to change a diaper, Anthony?  No.  Don't even ask.  It's not even funny anymore.  Just stop it.  Hate the children.  What do you like having them around the house?  Guess we opened up a door to you.  I really did.  That's just a casual question to Greg.  You really did.  Let's relax, bro.  Once they get a little older and you can actually fall.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Don't get me started on women.  With all four limbs, I hate them, right?  We did the divorce thing yesterday. 
[02:01:30]  Please.  It got a little ugly in here yesterday with the divorce talk.  It usually does.  We were just discussing how the guys get screwed in the divorce.  Oh, surely not.  And how we were saying Scott Peterson's, Lacey Peterson's mother was saying that, you know,  divorce is always an option, not murder.  And I was saying divorce isn't always an option for a lot of people.  It's too expensive.  I'm not saying murder shouldn't be an option.  I'm just saying.  Thank goodness you put that caveat in there, Anthony.  I think a lot of people out there were thinking, well, God, Anthony said divorce is an option. 
[02:02:00]  Maybe I should go the other way.  I got a bag full of broken glass, you know.  Sometimes the old Scott Peterson fishing trip seems a little more of an option than divorce.  Yeah, he had a great plan, didn't he?  Christmas Eve, don't worry about it.  Everybody goes fishing on Christmas Eve.  Of course.  What do you mean?  Aliens came.  They abducted her.  I've got excuses.  Great alibi.  Solid case.  You might want to think it out a little more.  Well, he thought it out a little better than that other jerk off did in Utah. 
[02:02:30]  Oh, God.  Look, you know, you're right.  Men do get screwed over.  Woo!  Wait, he wanted to go somewhere.  Go ahead.  No, I don't have any hilarious.  All my wife-killing humor is in my ass.  I don't want to break it out in case anyone comes down to Carolina.  Don't burn it all.  Don't burn it up on the opening.  Didn't his lies actually get him busted?  Like, his plan was actually, from a criminal point of view, except for the hair and the 
[02:03:00]  bone, I mean, he executed it pretty well, except for the fact that he got caught in the head.  But just the way he did it and he covered it up with the, uh...  Covered it up?  He took a mattress cover and wrapped her up in it and threw her away in the car.  Oh, I thought you were talking about the buffoon in Utah.  No, he was awful.  Scott Peterson.  I'm saying his own recorded conversations or things he said got him busted.  But, I mean, the crime itself, he did pretty...  You think that was pretty good?  Well, I mean, it was just, if you're going to do that, that's the way you would do it.  Dumping her body right where you went fishing?  All right, I'm not saying there weren't flaws. 
[02:03:30]  I mean, they're picking apart.  The criminal genius of Jim Norton.  Jim, maybe you should, uh, I don't know, stick to comedy and not murder plans.  Oh, my gosh, I've spilled Dr. Pepper all over the crime scene.  Well, I'll just leave.  No one will notice.  I just think that he did a good job with that as far as not getting busted until...  If his words, if he didn't have recorded conversations or if he didn't tell Amber, like,  yeah, my wife's gone two weeks before he killed her.  Yeah, yeah, I'm in Paris and it's so beautiful here.  What?  Exactly, that's what did him in, not the emergency.  Ah, the hubris of the criminal mind. 
[02:04:00]  It reminds me of a Columbo.  Ah, yes.  Two-hour Columbos.  They could be wrapped up in 15 minutes, but you've got to watch them.  Those were good because the criminal was always from some insane high-class realm.  They were always a composer or a conductor or a mystery writer.  It was never a Joe Schlubb dude who just wiped someone out with a hammer.  Oh, Ted, I can't believe you're here.  I'm in the middle of finishing my symphony.  And then they were always wildly arrogant, like, toasting themselves over the dead body  with a vintage Veuve Clicquot, you know. 
[02:04:30]  Well, nothing could wrap up my master.  And then it'd be something as painful as, like, the radio station was tuned to the wrong thing  and not keys Columbo into the, well, he wouldn't listen to country, he was a classic, you know.  Oh, my God.  He got him to talk.  That's what I loved about Columbo.  Two clues, you know.  Oh, yeah.  The people, if they would just lawyer up or just shut their mouths, you know,  I can't understand why there were footprints on this window.  And then the guy, well, perhaps, Columbo, he went here for air.  And he's, like, describing exactly what he did. 
[02:05:00]  Just shut your mouth.  Hey, Columbo, talk to my lawyer.  Yeah, he should have talked to you.  Shut your mouth.  I'm extraordinarily busy today, Lieutenant.  I have no idea why you're at my country home.  And they get him on the littlest thing, you know.  And that's when I noticed the second hand on your watch was five seconds.  Right, right.  I did kill her, Columbo.  Yes.  Knocked my watch against her teeth and it went off by five.  You're a genius.  You see the one where the body was on the wall and Columbo dialed her beeper? 
[02:05:30]  And he heard it beeping behind the wall?  They're beeping behind the wall.  There was a Hawaii Five-0 that had the best plot jump I've ever.  If the kids remember Hawaii Five-0, I assume it's still on in reruns.  Ah, the kids.  Until the end of time.  Hawaii Five-0 was fantastic.  It took place in Paradise and they drove giant black cars and wore black suits like no one else in Hawaii ever.  Basically, they look like gangsters in the show.  But so these kids steal like the King Omakawaki shawl from the Hawaiian Museum of Recent Antiquity. 
[02:06:00]  And they go to the scene of the crime.  The shawl's not there.  And they go, you know, it's probably art thieves.  And McGarrett, I swear to God, this is in the first reel.  Five minutes into the show.  But what if it was a group of kids?  Cut to.  Cam Fong is pulling up in front of their house.  Like he found the house.  So basically, they're just hiding the shawl for the rest of the episode. 
[02:06:30]  And I thought, couldn't you have waited until like after the second commercial for that revelation?  The end of the show?  Yeah.  It'd be like Columbo.  No, he did it.  Like two seconds in, you know.  And then we're just like driving the rest of the show.  If I can catch him.  He's just over the hill.  That's so funny.  He just never gets the case.  He's a homicide.  I like those shows.  And he never gets just those easy cases.  There was more cat and mouse.  I'm not a big CS.  I know everybody in the world loves every CSI show.  I know, yeah.  I don't like forensic stuff that much.  That loses me. 
[02:07:00]  Gives me the heebie-jeebies.  And the screaming memes.  Yeah, I don't like it at all.  And the willies.  I got a minor case of the willies.  The willies, too?  I like X-Files better.  I was more of an X.  Because it sort of combined that.  But then there was sci-fi things.  And it'd be like, oh, a fluke lived in his liver or whatever.  It's always something abstruse.  CSI, it's always gross.  He killed her and he ripped her head off.  I'm like, hey, dude, I can read the news.  I want to be entertained.  It doesn't like ER.  Some chicks in there.  I'm not a big ER fan. 
[02:07:30]  I watched it years ago once.  It seemed good.  I watched it once, too, trying to get into it.  Because everybody was watching it.  But it's one of the most depressing.  Like, I can't see sitting there to be entertained and just be depressed.  It was some episode where they had to tell a kid that his parents were killed and bring the kid into the room with a dead body.  It was horrible.  Yeah, sleep tight.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  That makes Jim laugh.  Jim loves laughing over horrid things. 
[02:08:00]  I like depressing things.  Actually, I like depressing shows, depressing films.  Yeah.  I like to get sad.  Jim likes to get sad.  If it's well done, if it's not tear jerky and forced.  I was more an NYPD blue kind of guy.  There was those camps, the cop show or the hospital shows.  It's been that way for a year.  Remember the medical center?  Yeah.  The medical center and then the cop shows were like the rookies, stuff like that.  That was more cop show.  Cop rock?  Cop rock.  What a great idea.  It's a cop show where they sing and dance.  Go.  That was terrific.  Terrific.  Were they that last one whole season?  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  Probably not even.  Or did it not even?  Yeah.  I'll pity that.  The world couldn't see the genius, man.  Every scene is the village people.  This dude turns around with a nightstick and lays a number on you, man.  And playing part of the drums, Rodney King.  Did you, now obviously you must have been a little disappointed at the outcome of the election.  No, did we?  In the Ukraine?  No, I think they're going to redo it.  And Yuchenko stands a chance of winning the vote. 
[02:09:00]  What happens to Yuchenko?  He looks like the Hulk.  He's changing into a superhero villain.  I think he spent some time in Brazil eating.  He's turned green.  He's green now.  Yeah, he is.  And he's got like some kind of growth thing.  His head is huge.  Like as if he was turning into the Hulk.  Remember the thing?  Yep.  Yeah.  I have nothing on that.  I'm just commenting on his physical...  I do remember the thing.  You mean from the Fantastic Four?  Yeah, right.  Yes.  Kind of looked like the guy.  Well, it's the first time I think the United States has ever been aware of the fact that 
[02:09:30]  there is a Ukraine or that it's a country separate from Russia.  It is.  Yeah.  The news just came in.  You know, good for them.  A wildly anti-Semitic country.  The Ukraine had, I think, a division in the Nazi army during the war.  That's just because they hated the Ruskies.  Yeah.  There you are.  So how bummed were you with Bush winning?  You know, I'm philosophical about it by adding an extra syllable. 
[02:10:00]  I wasn't surprised.  No, no one was surprised.  No, no.  There were people that were surprised.  There were these hardcore Kerry people that really thought he got a chance.  Vincent D'Onofrio wants to blow his brains out.  He's collapsing.  Oh, no.  Kerry did have a chance.  He got 52 million votes.  I think there was a lot of chicanery in this election, too, to be honest.  But everybody's going to jump me and go, I'm just going to plow forward and stuff like that.  I think he's going to have a tough road to hoe, as they say, in the next four years. 
[02:10:30]  Because history has proven, if you look at, I don't know, Nixon and Clinton, and that the second term is tough.  Reagan?  Very tough.  Reagan.  The second term, just boom.  People keep talking about Reagan.  They keep saying he was the greatest president of all time and a lot of stuff that bears no resemblance to reality or whatever happened in factual history.  That he stopped communism and the fact that one-fifth of the world is communist, I think, sort of belies the fact that stopping is a little strenuous. 
[02:11:00]  I think what they were talking about, though, it's a little, you know, the Soviet Union being communist was a little more of a threat than some South Americans.  I accept that, but that's not what people say.  You know how it is on the news.  People go, he stopped communism.  It's like, not really.  There go the billion people that are still communists.  Still around.  But in any case, yeah, his second term was brutal.  Everybody thinks that he was just wildly popular, but the last two years.  I think the third term is even tougher on presidents, to tell you the truth.  He never had higher than a 68% approval rate, I don't think Reagan did. 
[02:11:30]  I don't know where I'm yanking that statistic at, but he never had a very high approval rating.  No, and although I think in his, when he got re-elected, it was a lot more of a, you know, I don't know if it was a landslide, because I think only 30% of the electorate voted in that election.  I think you saw a lot more, you know, activity in this one.  Frankly, I think everybody on every side has reason to be cheerful, in that over 100 million people voted in this lazy-ass, apathetic, supposedly stupid country.  People are motivated and actually do know what's going on, so I can't see it as the worst thing in the world.  Do you think it was a bad choice, though, the Democrats putting Kerry in there? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, I think what was a bad choice was not standing for something.  I think the thing that Bush does that the Democrats never do is stand for what he stands for, and you can go fuck yourself if you don't like it.  And that's how I feel about my views, and that's how I feel everybody should feel, because it's the adult way to feel.  If you disagree with me, fine, let's disagree, and we'll discuss it.  But you disagree, and that's the, instead of, well, I hope you like me, well, I'll modify myself so I hope you like me a little bit. 
[02:12:30]  Like, gosh, over there, are you liking me? It's like, any comedian can tell you, 30% of the crowd hates you.  And that's even when you're killing, they just, uh-huh, uh-huh, they're going along with their friends, and then when they leave, they go, I hated that guy.  And you can't please all the people all the time, and I think the whole idea that they keep trying to reconstitute the party and go,  they need to appeal to the young, they need to appeal to the Bible Belt, they need to, no, they need to stand for something, man.  If he'd gone, I'm against the war, and that's what I'm against, and I'm for this, instead of, well, we did this, but we should have done it like that. 
[02:13:00]  But it's like, yeah, very wishy-washy, yeah.  You know, Bush gives a simple message, man.  He's going to kill sand monkeys, and Jesus is his pal, and guns are good, and goddammit, that resonates with people.  That's his message, and that's what he stands for, and everybody knows it, and there's no quibbling.  He's wishy-washy on immigration, that's the only thing, like, there's no policy with the, uh, the media of the Latin.  I hope I need some Mexicans, so by the way, everybody gets a free pass for two weeks.  Oh, no, he's not above, like, simple chicanery in politics every second of his life. 
[02:13:30]  I'm just saying that you know where he's coming from.  We said that about Kerry, just say something.  He just wouldn't say anything.  He was an intelligent man, and that's a threat to a lot of people.  This is, as you know, the country's kind of a, they like it simple.  The idea that, this is what killed me, was Lynn Cheney, who is, I understand, Dick Cheney's wife.  She, uh, she was, they were having a rally for Cheney, and who couldn't vote for him?  He's affable and warm and lovable, and clearly, clearly possesses the leadership qualities to make this country great. 
[02:14:00]  Um, rubbing his hands together like Mr. Burns, it took him 20 minutes to stand up.  If he doesn't resign in the first two years, I will lay you money on the opening, opening and ampony show.  The Jimmy Norton show, opening, that he will resign.  I mean, we've already had, all the rats are leaving the ship.  You've already seen this, and you knew this would happen, that Powell split and Tom Ridge.  Ashcroft fantastically saying, the object of securing the American people has been achieved.  Thanks.  Well, I'm sleeping well now, John. 
[02:14:30]  I'll be humming one of your hymns as I nod off.  And I'm off.  Yeah.  He leaves.  Job well done.  Pats himself on the back.  Oh, fantastic.  I've covered up the titties on all of the statues.  Now we can all rest.  The Al-Qaeda will no longer see Oreola.  So, Lincini, when the campaign was going, said, John Kerry's got a fancy haircut and a fancy manicure.  Like, being fancy was the crime against you.  Dick Cheney's a billionaire. 
[02:15:00]  I think fancy doesn't, it depends on what you perceive as fancy.  So, that's where the dividing line is.  The fact that John Kerry speaks French, is an intelligent person, and equivocates, basically didn't do him any favors.  But again, I wouldn't say it was a landslide or a mandate.  A landslide's when 80% of people think one thing, not 49% to 51% is not.  It was close.  If I have 11 guys and six of them agree with me, and I tell you that's a mandate, you might have something to say about it. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  Although the American public did go for Clinton twice, and he was definitely brighter than Bush Sr.  I agree.  You know what I mean?  So, sometimes they like a smart guy.  I mean, who else?  Who did he beat in the second election?  Dole.  You know what he had, though?  Oh, Bob Dole.  Yeah, Bob Dole.  He had, it was charisma, you know?  He had something.  You've got to appeal.  Huge rock star.  Great politician.  You've got to appeal to the people based on what they like.  And you've got to look at the majority of the American people.  What do they like on television?  What do they like to read?  Tough crowd?  What do they like to read? 
[02:16:00]  No, sorry.  They used to.  Not anymore.  It's like you said.  The simple stuff, the stuff they can really sink their teeth into.  They don't want to hear stuff that's going to confuse them.  They don't want to hear intellectuals.  They want something charismatic.  They want an easy catchphrase.  They want something simple, something they can all get behind, something that fits on  a bumper sticker or something.  You know, it's that kind of stuff, and that's going to win.  I think Clinton messed things up, though.  And Jim's right, because Clinton is probably the brightest president we've had since, I  don't know, what do you want to go back to, Carter or whatever.  I mean, the guy is cute. 
[02:16:30]  I like how you go right back to a Democrat.  I'll believe I noticed that.  Never go back.  Nixon was a bright guy.  Intelligent.  Nixon was very bright.  Nixon proceeds.  We can go back to Nixon.  Nixon was very bright.  And cagey, obviously.  Like Clinton, the lawyer.  But Clinton ruined it for everyone because he was all things to all people.  And then the next Democratic candidate you bring up after him, you've just had Mick Jagger,  the candidate.  And now you're bringing out Eddie Money.  You know what I mean?  It ain't happening the second time around.  Like, dude, no one had the all-encompassing cock that Clinton has. 
[02:17:00]  I mean, that guy was sexy to everybody across the board.  And, you know, Bob Dole is a perfectly fine candidate for president, quite frankly.  Not that I would have voted for him, but he'd been in the Senate a thousand years.  He knew everything about government.  You know what I mean?  He's a very honest guy.  He's a very sincere guy.  I mean, there's been worse qualified candidates.  Horrible patty cakes player.  Couldn't tell the difference between fake, what was it, concrete and real concrete.  Hey, this is so soft. 
[02:17:30]  And no one wants to see the 80-year-old man fall over.  That's bad.  That's bad.  But, you know, like I said, I think he messed up the curve a little bit.  It's going to be difficult to find someone with his kind of charisma.  W's got a certain kind of charisma, but not that kind of charisma.  It appeals to the middle of the country.  Yeah.  It really does.  I mean, you can argue a lot of elections.  Kennedy may not have beaten Nixon at all.  And, you know, if you want to go back to the 19th century, there's plenty of contested elections.  So it's a tradition in our country to jerry-rig it.  Yeah.  I don't think it's good, but, you know, hey. 
[02:18:00]  It really does sound like the battle cry of the liberal Democrat, though.  The whole, you know, ah, we didn't win, so it's fixed.  And I'm sure you hear that.  We didn't win, and it was fixed.  But I can appreciate, you know, also, like I say, I, you know, at a certain point, I OD'd right before the election.  Because I don't know about you guys, but I was up to my eyeballs in it and, you know, living and breathing it.  And now it's like, you know what?  The world goes on.  I've got stuff to do, and I'll keep fighting my fight. 
[02:18:30]  Trying to move on.  And they do their thing.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it could be worse.  All right, that's good.  It could be worse.  That's an optimistic viewpoint.  It could be worse.  I want to ask Greg about this, too, because you understand how Hollywood works the same way I do as far as the mentality out there.  Yeah.  Why is there no outcry about what happened to Van Gogh from the Hollywood elite over a filmmaker being killed over views?  Oh, well, because, one, he wasn't American, and, two, hadn't made any money in Hollywood. 
[02:19:00]  And he hadn't been there to be celebrated or anything like that.  If he'd been in Hollywood and had made a picture that made, you know, $70 million indie for, you know, Miramax or whatever, then, oh, yeah, there'd been a big outcry.  You know how selfish and up their own butt is.  We were talking about Pat Sajak's article yesterday where he wrote a great point.  Pat Sajak?  Really an article?  I know, that's what I said.  Because Pat Sajak's writing articles for a conservative publication.  Oh, really?  Because I was reading Wink Martindale in The Nation the other day.  A lot of people are extremely a canny observer of the political scene. 
[02:19:30]  It took so long to read that Pat Sajak thing, though, because you had to keep turning.  What a bump.  All right.  I'll give it a wacky horn.  No, he made a good point about how because it was a Muslim murdering somebody.  If that was even in the Netherlands, if it was an abortion, an anti-abortion activist who had shot and killed a filmmaker for making a pro-life, a pro-abortion movie.  Yeah, we know what you mean.  Yeah.  That they would still be up in arms here. 
[02:20:00]  But because it was a Muslim, they don't want to be seen as agreeing with Bush on anything.  And they've kept their mouths shut.  You understand what I mean?  If it was about something, that was an attack on the analogy of the left.  For some reason, if you come out with a view that is against Muslims or against even not against the whole religion, just against somebody that's Muslim.  If you come out with that view, you'll be looking, you'll be looked at like you're aligning yourself with the president.  And they are so, they so don't want to be aligned by the president.  Well, that's also, you have to remember, Pat Sajak's a Hollywood guy. 
[02:20:30]  And he feels that pressure of being one of 18 conservatives painted into a corner in that town.  And they get a little beleaguered sometimes and make those really faulty analogies like that.  Like Mel Gibson coming on TV and going, if my son was dying, I wouldn't want stem cellars.  You're like, relax, you're rich.  It's okay.  Everything will be all right.  Everything's going your way.  You got your president.  You know, you're good.  You know, Arnold Schwarzenegger is way more representative of what a conservative in Hollywood is like.  In other words, hey, whatever you want. 
[02:21:00]  He didn't even go stump for Bush, but for like two days, because he knows he has to stand for re-election in California.  Too many pictures of him with his arm around Bush in California and is like, okay, great for you.  He's very popular, though, man.  I like Schwarzenegger.  Everybody seems to like him.  He's pretty moderate.  Yeah, that's what I mean.  He's a Hollywood Republican.  Do what you like.  We're smoking pot.  Hey, right on.  As long as he can put ator at the end of everything he says.  As long as he can use his idiotic catchphrase.  And the crowd, again, see, it's what I was saying before.  The crowds love it. 
[02:21:30]  You're talking about Pat Sajak and Hollywood and how Hollywood won't do anything.  And then during the Republican National Convention, it was Hollywood's pure evil and people's morals aren't for Hollywood.  And yet they had Arnold Schwarzenegger speak as a keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention.  A man who's been governor for less than two years and has no history as a politician whatsoever.  Suddenly he's asked to speak there.  And funnily enough, because of his Hollywood fame of those morally uplifting movies like Predator and all those.  Morally uplifting.  Kindergarten Cop was good, though.  Kindergarten Cop was superb. 
[02:22:00]  Who doesn't like the Schwarzenegger action?  I love Predator.  Get to the chopper.  I love the Predator.  I think that's my favorite one of all of them.  The first one.  Do you love that one?  Yeah, yeah.  Which one?  Predator.  Because he covered himself with mud and the Predator couldn't see him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And our old governor would have never thought of that.  Greg Davis would just be a glistening.  He'd be sitting there getting killed.  Skull on the trophy shelf, man.  Picked clean, you know what I mean?  Spine right out, sure.  Yeah.  So, yeah, but I know what you're saying.  Well, that's the...  Yeah, that... 
[02:22:30]  What was that filmmaker's name?  Van Gogh, right?  Which makes it easier for Americans, because the only other famous Dutch person ever.  I know.  Most people didn't even know about the story, because they said Van Gogh and think it's...  Well, they're related.  He's a descendant related, yeah.  Thank goodness it wasn't Rutger Hauer.  Rutger Hauer.  Is he from the Netherlands?  Jerome Crabbe.  Wow.  All right, we should take a break.  All righty.  No, no, no, no.  No?  We'll get out of the politics thing.  Okay.  That was good, though.  Greg Proof's playing Carolines all weekend long for tickets.

[02:26:00]  Oh, what a game!  People spell their name however they want.  It has nothing to do with phonics or nothing.  I'm not sure what phonics is, but...  I saw the girl that was hooked on it.  She's got a problem with it, apparently.  Have you seen that commercial?  Hooked on phonics!  Work for me!  She's adorable, you know?  I was thinking, wouldn't that be weird if she was applying what she learned  and she couldn't get the commercial straight, you know? 
[02:26:30]  Hook it on phonics!  Working for me!  Hook it on phonics!  Working for me!  Me!  Okay, cut.  You talk to her, mate.  We ain't gonna move a lot of tapes this way.  Tellin' you right now. 
[02:27:00]  Anyway, I met this woman.  Her name was, uh, Amy.  You know, so I go, oh, uh, A-M-Y?  She goes, no.  A-Y-M-I-E.  Oh!  I have to take a nap.  I'm Brian.  B-R-I-V-O-L-B-N.  The number's stuffed in the letter Q.  B-R-I-V-O-L-B-N.  B-R-I-V-O-L-B-N-D.  Look at my name tag.  It's...  It's big.  You know, I started out in showbiz, uh, in about 19, really, I'd say 46, but actually 
[02:27:30]  it was 1944, when my front yard, uh, my grandfather bought me a cowboy uniform.  And, uh, they told me, don't slip in a dog poo-poo.  And I did.  And I just kept slipping in it and falling.  And they just laughed.  It was beautiful.  And that was my first comedy routine.  And I've just been slipping in shit ever since. 
[02:28:00]  Turn it over to this.  Welcome to the O.P. and Camp Star, you son of a bitch!  What the F is this?  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony show, the O.N.A. virus, spreading across America, 
[02:28:30]  thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  Dance music.  We love the satellite radio, Greg.  It's Greg Proofs in the studio.  Hello.  Playing Carolines all this weekend here in New York City.  Uh, for tickets, 212-757-4100.  The instant feedback has exploded.  Oh, yeah.  Greg is getting the people to react.  I told you, I said yesterday that, uh, the show's gonna be a lot different than yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  Larry the Cable Guy getting props, I have to say, because, uh, the Southerners and the  Truckers loving Larry the Cable Guy. 
[02:29:00]  I love the Southerners too, baby.  And, uh, well.  People think all kinds of weird things about me, like I walk into rooms and, I've played Houston  this year, uh, North Carolina, Atlanta.  Yeah.  And murder.  Yeah.  It's all good.  I was at the Montreal Comedy Festival.  I guess that's, uh, two summers ago now.  He freaking killed.  Sure.  Love your humor.  People think the country's divided into red and blue, and that's all nonsense.  There's pockets of insanity everywhere.  There's a guy writing on the instant feedback, Carter was intelligent.  You could hear a banjo every time he opened his mouth. 
[02:29:30]  Get it?  Wow!  That's funny.  And then Tom from North Carolina.  Because I could hear a stapler during that email.  Well, another thing Kerry had going for him was his run as Lurch on the Adam's family.  Wait a minute.  You're saying that Kerry looked weird, like a giant head from Easter Island, perhaps?  That he posed for the Five?  Let me get this straight.  He debated Douglas?  You're saying Kerry had a thing in it.  And people are begging that we get some truckers on the show. 
[02:30:00]  Just to balance us out.  How would a trucker balance me out?  That's what I like.  That's what they're saying.  I don't know.  Let me tell you.  Won't you leave the goddamn country if you don't like it?  Yeah, I love that viewpoint.  Because all my tax money's here.  Yeah, because I paid in advance to stay.  I do like the celebrities, though, that said they were leaving the country.  That's a very ill-chosen stance to take before an election.  Really, really bad, because no one forgets it. 
[02:30:30]  Talk about slippery slab.  I'm moving to France.  Well, I'm not moving.  I'm just going to go on a holiday there and then come back and sulk.  I'm eating French bread, okay?  That's as far as I'm going.  Let's talk tabloids.  All righty.  Let's move on.  Oh!  Well, Greg said...  Celebrities!  I was looking through the Daily News here, which is a...  It's a fine newspaper.  It's all ads.  Newspaper?  Newspaper?  Is that what it is?  It's nice.  Can I tell you something?  Yeah, buddy.  We consider ourselves intelligent on this radio show, but look around the room. 
[02:31:00]  We got the Daily News.  We got the New York Post.  And look what paper hasn't been opened yet today.  No one's in the New York Times.  The New York Times.  You can't believe anything that's in the New York Times.  The Times remains folded every day.  Every day.  All the news that's fit to print, a guy told us that you don't know, but never mind.  We'll verify it later.  We use the New York Times to cover up the windows when we get girls in here.  Sure.  There you are.  And that infrequent occurrence is only what? 
[02:31:30]  Like every time there's a solar eclipse or something?  Yeah.  Well, we got girls tomorrow.  Oh, hooray.  Who do you have tomorrow?  Two porn stars, and we're going to do cherry darts.  Cherry darts?  Yeah, we have this nice, intelligent conversation going on today, whether you agree or disagree.  And then tomorrow we got guys throwing cherry darts at naked girls' buttholes.  How come I miss that day?  How come I get intelligent conversation?  Who says I don't want some cherry darts in my life?  I threw an almond roca at Jenna Jameson once, man.  Nice.  How about this? 
[02:32:00]  We'll extend the invite.  You want to come back tomorrow and throw some cherry darts, you can.  All right.  Let me think about it, man, because I've got a Cubs show breakfast tomorrow.  Just to show the other side of Greg Proops.  I'm making pancakes for the Cubs tomorrow, and I've got stuff to do.  Bring a few of them in.  I'd love to toss something into their hairless backsides.  Which adult film stars have you tomorrow?  Some girl named Star?  Yeah.  I thought you said Star, porn stars.  Yeah, I know.  I said some girl named Star, and I'm trying to remember that they're not quite stars.  Yeah, but on which you've heard of them, should their legend precede them? 
[02:32:30]  We would rather not have the stars.  We would rather have the girls that are actually going to do some really nasty stuff.  We like a little skank in our women.  I see what you're saying.  Yeah.  A little skank.  May I peruse?  You could have a porn star come in here and then tell her, you know, we really want you  to bend over.  We want to throw a cherry and see how close we can get it to your bunghole, and we want  listeners to do it to win prizes.  And then they'll say no.  And you're like, but you're a porn star.  Can we say bunghole?  It's difficult to tell what this woman, is her name? 
[02:33:00]  That's Candy.  Oh, that's Candy.  Yeah, Candy.  They always have those names.  They're always named Fluffy and Pinky and Candy and stuff like that.  Notice no porn stars named Gertrude or Bertha anymore.  Not a lot of Ethels.  Right, not right.  Hey, Ethel.  No Miriams down there?  Yeah, you can't tell what she looks like because she's completely upside down.  And do you know Terry Weigel, who she is?  Yeah, I remember Terry Weigel.  She blew me on a, I was on an internet radio show with actually Chauncey Hayden, and she  said she'd give us Hummers.  And she did it for like a second. 
[02:33:30]  Her husband was there.  I was packing like one.  I couldn't even get the rubber done.  I rolled it down once and I couldn't, but she blew me for a minute.  So that was a portion of it.  Did Chauncey blow you too?  No, he didn't.  Fucking asshole.  Okay, I shouldn't have mentioned his name.  I can't stand that guy.  I'm just saying that that was the show I did and she blew me.  What a tool.  Yeah.  That doesn't take away from your Hummers story.  Oh, look at that.  That totally took away from your Hummers story.  No.  And took the comedy out of the room.  Candy is 19 years old and only been in porn for three months.  Where do you find these girls, Steve?  Oh, stop it.  That can't be true.  This is the guy that finds all our porn, Greg.  Don't get too close to his hat. 
[02:34:00]  You'll scorch yourself.  Every day he has to have some kind of flaming wear on.  It's a look.  Today it's the hat.  Yesterday, do you have the boots on today?  No, no.  The boots are getting stretched.  So they don't get me.  I thought you were getting more fluid put into them.  Oh.  It's like a lighter.  Yeah, I know.  I got that one.  Buchane, I should have said.  You have to endear yourself to the guys, to the directors who know these girls.  And a lot of the girls are fresh-faced 18, 19-year-old girls.  And that's where the 19-year-old Candy came from. 
[02:34:30]  So she was in high school.  She gets out and then decides porno.  Yeah.  Been in it for three months.  Mm-hmm.  Very nice.  A trucker that does like Greg.  I knew they were out there.  Johnny, what's up?  Of course they are.  Hey, bud.  I absolutely love you, Greg.  I saw you on Whose Line Is It Anyway?  Thanks, brother.  And I absolutely love you on there.  And I just want to redeem the truckers.  Thank God you guys actually have some intelligent conversation, intelligent guests.  Because you know what?  I couldn't stand Larry the cable guy if they would have set me up with his fucking jokes.  And then you guys just knock him the fuck down. 
[02:35:00]  It's good to hear you.  Wow.  I like Larry, too.  Enjoy Larry.  That's what I like about the show.  Thank you, John.  Every day is a little different.  And tomorrow, it's a bagatelle of cherry darts.  That's it.  Come one, come all.  Cold-hearted.  The trucker.  One more here.  Let's go.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I think you guys ought to use Greg as a substitute if Jimmy calls in sick or he has  to go on tour because he's a funny bastard.  Yeah, Greg is very funny.  I never call in sick and I never go on tour for that one reason. 
[02:35:30]  Believe me.  I know they're going to put some other comic in here.  And then she'll be like, ah, take a couple days.  That's pretty funny.  I know.  Just to break it up a little bit.  You can never take a day off, man.  That's the old Hollywood creed.  Look, you're doing a terrific job.  Go to Hawaii for a week.  Relax.  I've got a quick, stupid question for Greg.  Yes, sir.  That movie Little Nicky, the guy with the glasses, that they were giving a hard time,  that wasn't you.  No, that wasn't me.  Was that Andy Dick who was in Little Nicky?  I don't remember.  No, I didn't see Little Nicky. 
[02:36:00]  I would have remembered, though, because I'd be getting the checks from the DVD.  So it wasn't me, brother.  But thanks for thinking of me.  Did they confuse you with Andy Dick?  No, never.  I was just guessing who wears glasses that was in the movie, man.  Jerry in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, fellas?  Hey.  Good morning, sweetie.  Hi, Angel Face.  Yeah, I was just, actually, two quick questions.  I was wondering what you're doing on a radio show since you starred in Star Wars Episode  I, The Phantom Menace.  What I'm doing on a radio show because of that? 
[02:36:30]  Well, I like to visit the regular people once in a while.  I like to walk amongst the dirty, scruffy, workaday, blue-collar guys.  I lay my hands on the afflicted, and they're cured.  All right.  Star Wars was good fun.  Believe me.  Oh, you were in that?  I was in the, I think, what I would consider everyone's favorite episode, that would be  The Phantom Menace, possibly the finest motion picture ever made.  Apparently, some of the plot was destroyed on its way to the theater in a horrible accident, 
[02:37:00]  so it was a little confusing.  Yeah, I was a pod race announcer in that one.  Oh, cool.  I don't care what galaxy you're from, that's got to hurt.  That was my voice.  Really?  Oh, that was you.  I didn't know.  They CGI'd our heads out.  But we did wear giant, we shot on the day, and we wore giant prosthetic heads that they  made for us at Leavesden, outside of London, and it was me and another comic named Scott  Capura, who's from San Francisco, and we were the voices of the pod race announcers.  That is probably the coolest thing ever.  We were both working in Scotland at the time, and they cast it over there because they shoot 
[02:37:30]  overseas.  You've just been brought up 20 levels.  There you are.  I was also in The Nightmare Before Christmas.  I'm several voices in that.  I get a good voice every once in a while.  How was George Lucas?  Very relaxed.  You should be so relaxed with $200 million on the line.  Really?  Yeah, he walked in.  He went, that was great.  You want to shoot it again?  Okay, George.  That was it?  Okay, George.  There was like 100 people standing around, a blue screen.  You know, nothing was shot like a movie.  It wasn't like, you know, I wasn't... 
[02:38:00]  It's all blue screen.  Did you get to call him?  Yeah, yeah, I wasn't holding Alicia Cuthbert in my arms or whatever.  You get to call him George, too?  Yeah.  All casual?  Hey, man, he's from the Bay Area.  We're all from the Bay Area.  It's, you know, it's that, hey, how are you doing?  Something to talk about.  Is that how you got the gig?  Liberal fascism.  No.  I'll tell you how I got the gig.  I have an American accent, and they were looking for American accents in England.  Oh, wow.  Really?  And me and the other guy are comedians, and we made up stuff.  So we were able to both do sports announcers and go, he's got the funk in his trunk.  He's got the skills.  You know, that nonsense.  Looks like chicken. 
[02:38:30]  Tastes like chicken.  Boo-yah.  And you couldn't have a...  And I think they wanted American voices for the...  That's my guess.  That's my guess.  Yeah.  Because it was a pod race, and it's like a car race.  Oh, you don't got to tell me.  You want people to...  I know.  So that it's not, you know, John Gielgud announcing the car race.  Did they have dialogue for you?  Big deal of excitement as they go around the far turn here.  He plays it square.  Did they what?  Have dialogue for you, or did you improv it?  Well, they would get mad if we said we am...  There was creative latitude. 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  So we were allowed to...  Creative latitude.  We were allowed to do some stuff.  But yes, there was dialogue.  Obviously, they had written all the names of the characters and all that, and it was fun,  you know?  It was only one day's work.  What I do have is the polar fleece.  This is for the geeks out there.  I say geeks.  I hate that word.  But this is for the devotees out there, for the faithful.  Star Wars polar fleece, it says episode one.  And if Star Wars fans will know what that means.  It didn't have a name.  It wasn't called the Phantom Menace until right before it got released. 
[02:39:30]  And as you know, the chronology is goofy.  Whatever.  The first Star Wars is actually number four.  Four.  So carrying on backwards, I was in the first one.  Right.  Even though it's the...  Not...  Yeah.  Just...  I think I've lost everybody, but the Star Wars people know what I'm talking about.  So I possess a piece of gear that does not say the Phantom Menace.  It says episode one on it.  And I think if you went on eBay, which I would never do, it's in my closet, but...  So that's an exciting piece of Star Wars trivia.  Put it up and see what they bid. 
[02:40:00]  I get...  The Star Wars thing gets more...  My agent in England said, don't do it.  Why?  It doesn't...  It's not this.  It's not that.  It's not this.  I said, it's Star Wars.  It's Star Wars.  You idiot.  For the rest of my life.  For the rest of my life.  Star Wars?  Right.  I can go to Japan.  And sign autographs.  You know what I mean?  And everybody knows it, like ever.  So, of course.  Why would I say no?  I had to do it.  Hell yeah.  It was great fun.  And I'm glad that anyone liked it.  Just being part of the whole Star Wars thing. 
[02:40:30]  Hell, I...  You gotta do it.  Yeah.  So, exactly.  It was fun.  Do things and don't even get paid for it.  For instance, I did a voice in another picture that came out that sank so quickly, like a  stone, called Kaina the Prophecy.  Catchy name.  I know you're thinking, how come I didn't hear about it?  It sounds so sexy.  The word Kaina and prophecy in the title of the movie?  How did I not get out there?  How did it fail?  Kirsten Dunst was the lead in it.  Angelica Houston.  It was Richard Harris' last picture.  Me and another guy named Mike McShane, who's also an improviser. 
[02:41:00]  He was on the British shoes line.  A big guy.  And we were...  It was crazy.  Like, they live on a planet.  It was a cartoon.  I'm sorry.  It was an animated feature.  Right.  And it was like a French thing.  And it finally got released this year.  We worked on it like three years ago.  And it just...  You know, like, into the void.  Tank.  But I thought that was a good one.  You know what I mean?  You just don't know.  You have no idea when you're doing stuff what's gonna...  Obviously, when you do Star Wars, you have a pretty good notion that people are gonna  see it.  Yeah.  But with the Kaina thing, I thought, hey, Kirsten Dunst is in this. 
[02:41:30]  Can't lose.  Right.  Not that I thought I was gonna get famous or anything.  I just thought someone...  I haven't seen it.  That's how obscure it is.  I think it's on DVD.  One of the things was a movie Jay Moore did, Pay It Forward.  Remember that?  I remember.  He was pushing this, like, saying, Kevin Spacey coming right off his Oscar win.  Uh-huh.  This is gonna be huge.  And, you know, I was thinking, wow, yeah, that's a great...  Helen Hunt.  Two Oscar winners.  This is gonna, you know, boost him right over the top. 
[02:42:00]  Haley Jo Osment was in it, too.  Yeah, yeah.  A little cute little kid.  It got paid forward right from the theater to the blockbuster in about a week.  Yeah.  It was awful.  That's the thing about Kevin is people always go, how come you did that terrible thing?  And it's at the time, I think, you think...  You don't think I'm doing a terrible thing.  You think I'm doing something that everyone will enjoy, and then wait.  It's gonna be huge.  Yeah, 40 years later, it gets exhumed.  Maybe it'll be a cult classic one day.  One never knows.  Never know.  Well, you know, there's no...  You can't complain.  So you're looking at the tabloids, right, there in the Daily News? 
[02:42:30]  Yes, I am.  That's where we were going, right?  Oh, yeah.  Let's go there.  With the Paris Hilton and the Olsen twins and...  Am I wrong, or just people perv on the Olsen twins a little more than I'm comfortable with, quite frankly?  Well, ever since they turned 18.  It's not a big deal anymore.  It's not hot anymore.  They have giant heads and skinny little Tootsie Pop bodies, and...  They never develop like they thought they were going to develop, is what it comes down to.  They shiver.  They're like Who's from Whoville, is what they look like to me.  They have giant eyes.  I mean, I'm sure they're perfectly nice people, but it's just so pervy to me. 
[02:43:00]  This whole country's so pervetronic.  And they're like, Lindsay Lohan.  Here you've got a big one.  We love her, though.  They're teenagers, man.  I'm old enough to be their dad.  People come up to me to their dad age and go, He reminds me of my dad.  And you're like...  Yeah, it makes you leave clear stuff, doesn't it?  You know?  Exactly.  Fair enough, you know?  You're not into like the Lindsay Lohan?  You don't look at her and think for a split second, like, wow, she does have nice titties? 
[02:43:30]  Like Jimmy Carter, who you could hear banjo music playing whenever he spoke.  Maybe I'll lust in my heart ever so briefly, but no, it's too pervy for me.  Yeah.  It's too pervy for me.  Literally, I'm 45 years old, man.  Lindsay Lohan, you know, could well be my daughter.  I think she's 18.  Her bad behavior, I think she is.  If I had a daughter, I know she'd be a drunk, and I think that's exciting.  My question is, like, say you're Paris Hilton's parents or whatever. 
[02:44:00]  Now, when you're having the Thanksgiving dinner and everyone's gathered around the, you know,  the drug loaf or whatever it is you're eating, do you have a slideshow?  You know, do you like show home movies or whatever and go, this is her first, oh, not that one.  And then, you know, she's so orange and so white-haired.  And that seems to be this look that all girls have now, like the Christina Aguilera, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton. 
[02:44:30]  Orange.  Jessica Simpson.  Jessica Simpson.  They're like the Eloi that lived on Earth that the Morlocks drove underground to eat in the Time Machine.  They have that white, white hair and the orange, orange skin.  There's a Star Trek episode, too, with Call or whatever, and they drive the white hair.  Vol.  Vol, that was it.  Vol puts the fruit on the tree.  Exactly.  Kirk punched him in the face.  That's what these people are.  They're like the cattle of now, and they are going to be driven into a machine so that we can survive on them in the future. 
[02:45:00]  But someone like Paris Hilton is absolutely necessary in society.  What would we do if she didn't exist?  Who would we pin our hopes and dreams on?  She appears to have no talent whatsoever, right?  Any reason to exist.  Nothing.  She's wealthy and she's ephemeral.  She's like an anemone in the sea.  She's beautiful and yet doesn't really produce that much altogether.  Now we know that she slept with Colin Farrell.  This was duly reported a couple of days ago, like on TV and in the paper.  She slept with Colin Farrell, everybody. 
[02:45:30]  So I took out my checklist.  Checked off Colin Farrell.  Right.  You know, like, okay, we're mowing through.  There's only 3.8 billion people left on Earth.  But that gives you a purpose, or it gives her a purpose now.  You just have the checklist, and now it gives you something to do every time she does something.  She's had two TV series.  We're talking about Hollywood.  That'll point out to you what's going on in Hollywood.  People think that show business is a meritocracy, and they say,  that guy's really good.  How come he doesn't have a show?  Or that actress is really good.  How come she's not in more movies?  Because they're not interested in good. 
[02:46:00]  Good is the most irrelevant thing in the history of mankind.  You get Paris Hilton on TV.  If Paris Hilton makes money, Paris Hilton's on TV.  If monkeys banging on a stick were what was popular,  that's what would be at Caroline's this week.  They would not have comics ever.  And they'd have a show on the WB.  Oh, dude, they do.  It's called Monkeys with Sticks.  How many series have you had, Jim? 
[02:46:30]  What?  How many TV series have you had?  Never even been on a sitcom.  See?  I would love to tune in and see Jimmy on something.  My lack of acting ability would really spoil it.  I'm a good guy to walk in.  I'm like, you know what I mean?  You were on Ed once.  Oh, yeah.  I actually forgot.  Oh, there you are.  See, you were on Ed.  Yeah, I totally forgot about that until you said it.  You did a good job with that.  Thank you.  Yeah, it was fun.  But no, I'm not.  What was your line?  I was in the whole episode.  It was me and two other friends were suing a guy who was actually played Dennis  Menace's father in the movie.  That's the guy who we were suing.  And Ed was the lawyer defending us. 
[02:47:00]  We were childhood friends suing the guy for getting rich.  Sweet.  And I was terrific.  Mr. Favisham.  Out of the question.  Out of the question.  And it's funny how they talk to you.  I guess it was going well.  And they're like, hey, man, they're talking about doing a spin-off with you three.  You know how full of shit you are you set?  And I was such a green worm.  I'm like, really?  Well, maybe we can have our own show.  But the three guys will suing someone.  And then the next day, can I get back on the lot?  No.  Nice to engage you on.  Your name's not on the list.  Get out of here.  Become a recurring character like those three guys on New Heart. 
[02:47:30]  I was listening to you guys, actually, for the first time in the trailer.  Well, the second time I was in the trailer waiting for that shoot.  I was listening to them.  See?  You get a trailer.  This is how good acting is.  And the food.  They give you lunch or whatnot.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And you're just doing a walk-off.  There's nothing better than doing a TV show, man.  Friends.  That was one of my lines.  Like, yeah, right.  Friends.  I'll bring it in someday.  I like how you delivered that.  You never saw that episode?  No.  Convincing.  You should bring that in.  Yeah, you should, man.  Yeah, we got to play that.  On the line reading.  That's the best line. 
[02:48:00]  We definitely got to play it on the line.  I was on a Family Matters.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, fantastically.  That's a cartoon, right?  Huh?  Is that a cartoon or no?  No.  No, the one with Urkel, man.  That was the Urkel.  The TV show with Urkel.  That was great.  Then Urkel turned into a man and ruined the show.  Yeah, it was toward the end.  And it was a Stefan Urkel because he had that alter ego that was a smooth operator.  That was him saying, I don't want to be this gleeby dork.  It was great.  I still get checks from that.  That's like Vic.  Wow.  You know, little checks.  What was his name when he became Vic on Taxi?  That's what a cop was in. 
[02:48:30]  You get sick of being the cute guy, and then you're like, you want to be the tough guy.  I'm serious.  Take me for more than I am.  I'm an artist.  That always works well.  Well, see, that's the thing.  You know, people go, oh, you're on this show, and then, oh, I don't want to be identified  with who's line.  Who's line's not my, like, hey, fuck it.  Whatever you, if you dug who's line, right on.  You know what I mean?  And the two people that I use is Adam West, who played Batman in the old series, when  I was a kid, who was my hero.  When I met him, I met him years ago in England, and he did a reading of his book, which was  Back to the Batcave. 
[02:49:00]  He couldn't be happier.  He's not bitter at all.  And then William Shatner, who I've also met and did a TV show with once in Scotland, couldn't  be happier to be Captain Kirk.  Oh, yeah.  Signing autographs.  You know what I mean?  It's the people who played, like, you know, Snoogie on the Fwiggles, and they go, man, I  loved you as that kid.  I'm not really Snoogie.  I'm a Shakespearean.  Hey, dude, to the world you are.  You know what I mean?  Be happy that you have any truck with the public at all.  If the public likes you one iota, don't piss on that. 
[02:49:30]  You know what I mean?  Screech hates being Screech.  Dustin Diamond, yes.  You know what I mean?  And what's his name?  Mark, who used to play Skippy on it.  Mark Price.  He tried to get out of that.  And then you realize, like, because he does stand-up and stuff.  It's like, no, you've got to embrace that, man.  You don't want to be it your whole life, because obviously you have a life.  But, like, if that's what people like you for, that's what I'm saying.  Like, I did 14 years on Whose Line.  So, hey, right on.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I never worked on it for more than two or three days a year.  Oh, man.  But everybody thinks I did it every day of my life that I punched in with a time clock 
[02:50:00]  and wore a hard hat and, like, and right on, you know.  If you like the show, you like the show.  Who am I to tell you that your taste, you know, actually, I'm a stand-up comedian and  my pithy insights are, you know.  Do you like child actors?  Your brother's so below me.  Hey, I tell dick jokes in bars to drunks.  You know, hey.  That's how it works.  Most of the guys, the child actors, if they, yeah, but if they don't blow their brains  out, they always end up finding some peace, like, years and years down the road. 
[02:50:30]  You know, they never get to it right away.  Oh, yeah.  It's usually just this horrible, e-true Hollywood story, and then, you know, years later, they're  like, well, you know, I'm glad I was Skippy or, you know, whatever other.  But Jodie Foster's amazing.  Jodie Foster made the transition from, like, childhood to adulthood.  Some of them can do it.  She said the most interesting thing, I thought, because Hollywood is such a cosseted place  where everybody's kept from the reality.  And, you know, people don't, people who you wouldn't even believe, I won't say, but, 
[02:51:00]  like, have assistants.  Like, you'll call someone who you thought was, like, your friend, and they have an assistant.  And you go, well, I don't want to deal with your assistant because I was going to ask you  if you wanted to go, you know.  But she said, Jodie Foster said, I go deliver my own, I go to the post office.  I go shopping.  Which, no one should get an award for these things.  Do you think she does or just says that she does?  No, she does, and she takes care of her kids.  You see her with her children and stuff, or pictures of her with her children.  I don't think she was asking for a claim for it, and no one should. 
[02:51:30]  But the point is, in Hollywood, people don't.  Yeah.  People don't go to the post office.  They have excised the things from their lives.  She said, this is what your life is.  Your life is doing your laundry.  Your life is picking up your dry cleaning.  And when all of a sudden you don't do any of those things anymore, then you're just laying,  you know what I mean?  You've infantilized yourself to the point where you're like, my art is so important.  I pretend to be other people, you know.  Right, right.  Like.  Get a grip.  You know.  Like, I'm buddies with Drew Carey, and Drew Carey is the deal. 
[02:52:00]  He doesn't.  You don't get an assistant when you call him.  You get him on the phone.  And when he wants you to do something, he calls you and goes, you want to do this thing.  You don't have to go through a big dance or anything like that.  And people go, what's he like?  It's like, no, he's really like that.  You got his number?  He drinks beer, and he's a nice guy.  What?  You got his number, then?  I just want to kind of call him.  Oh, yeah, of course.  I'm giving you, I'm going to give it out on XFM.  He asked me to.  He said, what I don't want is any privacy, Greg.  I want everyone in America calling me.  No, but he's really lovely with people and stuff like that.  So, you know, I think I got lucky with the, my millionaire friend is nice. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  He doesn't shine me.  Let's get Greg out of here.  Until we're done.  This was excellent.  You want to come back tomorrow for cherry darts?  Oh, do I?  Come back tomorrow.  Do I?  We want to see the other side of you.  Do I?  We want to see what kind of aim you have.  You ever play Lemonhead Submarine?  What's that?  When you stand beneath them, you take a mouthful of Lemonheads, they stand over you.  You guys are all looking at me like this is really a game.  I know.  I know.  We're all fascinated.  That's serious.  You know what?  We're all fascinated.  We're looking for new games in this program.  We're thinking you might have something. 
[02:53:00]  Lemonhead, let me write that down.  Dude, we were so with you.  Come on.  Milk.dump truck.  I think you can get the idea.  Yeah.  Jimmy knows.  Boy, do I.  Yeah.  400 for that, eh?  Well, half and half included.  This was great.  Greg Proops, very, very funny guy.  Absolutely.  He's going to be at Caroline's all this weekend for tickets 212-757-4100.  And if you're in the area, stop by tomorrow and throw some darts with us.  Thank you.  You're very kind.  I appreciate it.  I don't know if I'll be able to see Star and Brandy, because I think I haven't, like I 
[02:53:30]  say, I've got a Black Panther breakfast.  I'm doing nothing.  Very important.  Over in the Bronx.  Huey Newton would appreciate this, though.  Just humiliate those white bitches.  Very good.  As we go to break, Anthony, I got the George W. Bush there, the Imagine thing we used to  play.  All right.  In honor of Greg Proops stopping by.  Have you heard this yet?  No.  Someone took all of Bush's speeches and found the lyrics to Imagine, and then kind of put 
[02:54:00]  this thing together.  Put it together.  It's actually George Bush's words.  Yeah.  Check this out.  Imagine there's no heaven.  It's easy to be tried.  No hell below us. 
[02:54:30]  Above us, only sky.  Imagine all the people living for today.  The color girl's city.  Take a walk on the wild side.  One, two, three, four.  Imagine yourself countries.  It isn't hard to do that. 
[02:55:00]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Nothing to kill or die for.  No religion, too.  Imagine all the people living life in peace.  The color girl's city.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side. 
[02:55:30]  Imagine no possessions.  I wonder if you can.  No need for grief or hunger.  No need for grief or hunger.  No need for grief or hunger.  No need for grief or hunger.  No need for grief or hunger. 
[02:56:00]  No need for grief or hunger.  No need for grief.  No need for grief or hunger is still there.  Maybe not for grief or hunger.  Imagine all the people.  Sharing all the world.  The color girl's city.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side 
[02:56:30]  Take a walk on the wild side  Take a walk on the wild side 
[02:57:00]  Take a walk on the wild side 
[02:57:30]  Take a walk on the wild side 
[02:58:00]  Take a walk on the wild side 
[02:58:30]  Take a walk on the wild side 
[02:59:00]  Take a walk on the wild side 
[02:59:30]  The guy sitting next to me is losing his mind  Apparently he had a lot to live for  He goes, hey man, hey man, hey man 
[03:00:00]  If one of these engines fails, how far will the other one take us?  All the way to the scene of the crash  Which is pretty handy because that's where we're headed  I bet we beat the paramedics there by a half hour  We're hauling ass 
[03:00:30]  So, anyway, it's the O and A virus  XM202, XM202, XM News, talk, sports, and information  It's everything, it's everything, it's everything, it's everything, it's everything, all the time  The group, Opie and Anthony  Do some push-ups, fatty  This is the best show ever  The Opie and Anthony  Great proofs was all right, huh? 
[03:01:00]  Yeah, I liked him a lot  The other side sometimes, you know  You get a Larry the Cable guy  Then you get a Greg proofs  That's the beauty of the Opie and Anthony show 
[03:01:30]  Every day, something a little different  Can I say, to please the Yankees  Stop with Randy Johnson  He's fucking 41  God almighty, stop it  I don't think they're gonna  Yeah, they bailed on him  That's old news  But they were trying and every year they tried  They're tempted to give up Javier Vasquez  We have fucking stop it  They wanted too much, so they're out  Alright, good  They announced today they're out  They're not gonna pursue Randy Johnson anymore  Good, enough already  Relax, it's over  He's still in the papers  He is really good, though 
[03:02:00]  Dude, I don't want him  I hate his guts  I understand  He's a mariner  Fuck him and fuck Pedro  God almighty  Is there no dignity in sports?  No  You're right  Of course not  You follow the team that has the less dignity  The less dignity?  I know  No, I don't like what Steinbrenner does  The lesser of the dignity that dignity has to offer  Are you saying the Yankees have the least amount of dignity in the Major League Baseball?  Yeah, they're a bunch of whores  That's not true, though  When dumb Steinbrenner was out  And they built this team of all young players  Bernie, oh, you know, you don't hold the Yankees 
[03:02:30]  I'm not gonna go over for the rest of the country  But they were all young, homegrown Yankees  That's why they were a great team  Yeah, just like A-Rod, you know  Yeah, but Boone went down  Boone got hurt  And then you trade in Soriano  You get rid of him and you're picking up A-Rod  That's a bat for a bat  You gotta go with A-Rod  I love Soriano, but you gotta go with A-Rod  Oh, whatever  Uh-huh  You don't think I had an answer for that, did you?  Smoothies  It's smoothie time  I'm not getting smoothies  Why?  Because to pick up on where you left off yesterday  I shit Conor Peterson when I got home  All right  Enough with the Conor Peterson references

[03:03:30]  And we have  He's not known for music, is he?  Over the years that he's been in the public eye  Has he ever put out any type of music?  Nope  Well, he's had a tough life  And now he's singing songs about it  And people want to hear his songs  They do?  Unfortunately, I can't find it here  There's so many CDs around  I don't know which one  Oh, here we go  It really is a bevy of CDs  Another self-important jackass  Who thinks just because he had a tough life  That everyone wants to hear him 
[03:04:00]  Warble about it to music  Well, Liz Smith  Warble  That was great  Warble  That's a great word  It's a great word  Fucking great  Liz Smith is in the paper today  Yuck  Ranting and raving about the new Robert Downey Jr. CD  She liked it?  She likes it a lot  Figures  Yeah, that does  She wants to stay close to the Hollywood people  She never has a bad word to say about anyone  Unless they're really on their ass and can't help her  Some duller just rambling about his own pain 
[03:04:30]  We all got it, stupid  And you know something?  It might be good if he was a good singer  Right  And if, let's say  He was a good songwriter  And if he wasn't a jackass actor beforehand  Oh, he's a great actor  You want to hear  Yeah, I know  But he's a jackass  You want to hear a good guy writing about his pain and stuff  Pop in a Nirvana album  Yeah, he did it well  The guy did it well  Did it right 
[03:05:00]  It was entertaining and sounded good  And he's a singer  He should have been doing it  We interrupt this discussion to say hi to Stephanie in PA  Stephanie, what's up?

[03:06:00]  Ed, the sociopath kind of Hawaiian  Who kind of sat there  He sat down with his hands kind of on his knees resting  Which is always the sign of someone who has bloody child's underpants in their closet  That's probably why we haven't gotten many sexy estate competitors  It's not mandatory that if you do this that Jim will come over your house and try to have sex with you  Yeah, for some reason people might have this  No, they invited me over  Of course they did

[03:15:30]  What a good egg.  Hello?  Did you say something?  No, keep going.  I'm okay.  What, are you going to do it all day?  This is a first for satellite radio, everybody.  Where'd she go?  I don't know.  He's putting ten inches in her ass.  She's probably trying to keep her kidneys in.  Oh, oh. 
[03:16:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, too many fucking pillows on here.  What is your problem, you insensitive asshole? 
[03:16:30]  Make me cum, make me cum.  You are a disgusting fat body, Brother Kyle!  Is that supposed to be sexy? 
[03:17:00]  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous!  Oh, baby, come across my back. Come across my back, baby.  Oh, come on, honey.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 
[03:17:30]  Poor people tend to live in clusters.  Oh, I think they have me on hold.  Oh, I think they have me on hold.  Oh, no.  Oh, yes.  Hello?  Yeah.  Wait.  I'm thirsty. 
[03:18:00]  Hoo-ah.  Hoo-ah.  Hoo-ah.  Oh.  Stephanie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was great.  Wow.  That was great.  Did he really put it in your dumper?  Yeah.  Mmm.  Nice.  What a good egg.  He's out back hosing his cock off.  Like I said, man, tune in every day.  You never know what you're going to hear on this damn program.  You know what?  I don't even think we have to go to the listeners on this one. 
[03:18:30]  I think we have a new sexiest state in America.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  I don't see how California was better than that.  That's pretty good.  What do you like to Pennsylvania?  I mean, what do you guys think?  You guys aren't professionals, are you?  Who are?  Yeah.  No.  Because California was good, but these guys are just regular people,  and he's packing 10, and he really gave it to her.  She took it like a trooper.  You sure did.  What do you guys think?  I'm very comfortable going with Pennsylvania.  I'm liking it, yeah.  Pennsylvania. 
[03:19:00]  What does the insulin feedback say?  It was amateur.  It was very real.  Which is good.  Yeah.  Let's see.  Please stop.  It sounds like someone is slaughtering a hippo.  Did it in the dumper, which was nice.  Yeah.  It's like you stirred a big glass of Nestle's quick with his cock.  Chief from New York.  Now the little fatso wants 10 inches of cheesesteak heroes.  Oh, Jesus.  Come on.  I'm tired.  Militant rabbit.  Bravo. 
[03:19:30]  F California.  These two gave me a full rod.  Let's see.  Turn the damn music off.  You tools.  We got it already.  New Jersey Dave.  Come already.  Jesus.  It wasn't that long.  You know, for radio it's kind of long because you like tying things up quickly.  Yeah.  I was a little concerned from thinking, you know, we could go for a long time.  I wonder if they want us to like be done already.  Mormon from D.C.  Sounds like an alien is about to burst out of her chest.  John in Minneapolis. 
[03:20:00]  I'm not buying this.  These guys are faking it.  No, they're not.  Not at all.  Not at all.  We were wondering what happened when he stuck it in the balloon knot and someone's writing.  I think he pushed her into the next room.  Very good.  Very good.  You guys definitely killed.  Yeah, it was great.  Pennsylvania, officially the sexiest state in America.  The sexiest state.  Pennsylvania.  And I like the Pennsylvania Poco.  It would be a good choice.  Thank you.  Thank you, Anthony.  Thank you.  Fit in with the whole Pennsylvania thing. 
[03:20:30]  How long have you two been a couple, if I might?  Three years.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, there you go.  All over three years, yeah.  So you must be really stretched out.  No.  You've got to do exercises.  Ten inch guy.  Greg from Ohio.  Holy F, that sounded like a normal day at Kobe Bryant's house.  Everyone's loving that they did it in the Das Dumpar.  Das Dumpar.  Das Dumpar.  That was the first Das Dumpar.  You like it in Das Dumpar, don't you? 
[03:21:00]  Das Dumpar.  Wow.  I don't know what else to say.  That was excellent.  Steven wants to know if Jimmy's ready to go buy a hooker yet.  No, I've been good.  I actually came very close last night, but I didn't do it.  He said he came very close last night.  Greg is guessing murder.  Yeah.  Call back to a show we did about a month ago.  Tonight's episode, ass full of murder. 
[03:21:30]  That sounded like the extended version of the Canadian PSA.  All right.  Very good.  You guys definitely are the highlight of the show today.  Thank you.  After ass full of murder, the number would just be X and that would be for his cock.  Of course.  Ten.  A little Roman numeral humor there.  All the rage these days.  That's good.  Six minutes after you say it, I have to rifle through Roman numerals and finally remember  what X means except for on any... 
[03:22:00]  Let it go.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  You're going.  I knew it was going to bomb and I stopped it.  Very good.  Yeah.  Joe from Boston.  Ten inches.  Holy S.  I'll bet her poop shoot is on Steve.  I come every time anyone else does a Steve Fire joke, everyone laughs and I do it and  you look at me like a deer in headlights until I say, Steve Fire.  Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Because yours are too intelligent.  Sometimes yours...  Oh, is that it?  Thank you.  A little too intelligent.  I go a little too far with it?  You just...  You're a little too hip for the room at times.  Ah. 
[03:22:30]  Great.  We like our Steve jokes simple.  Someone wants to know if you still make noise when you fart.  Oh, that ain't right.  It sounds like...  And Ed from Jersey, I guess PA hasn't pulled out of talks with the big unit.  Mmm.  Nice.  The big unit.  That was a little highbrow.  Ask Sex Wins, of course.  Yeah, I think that put it over the top.  I think that put Pennsylvania over the top for Sexiest State was the balloon knot action.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, we're going to let you guys go. 
[03:23:00]  Very good.  Okay.  Pennsylvania.  Bravo.  It's official.  The sexiest state in America.  Thanks, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  Miss, I'm too good.  Hey, Jimmy.  What?  She didn't get it because she tried it twice.  Of course.  She looked the fool because she said it twice.  Now she's thinking she got you.  Nah, but the second time, if someone really needs to talk to you, they go, look, alright,  what?  I got to talk to you.  Okay.  But if they try to get you once, they don't get you.  No, they didn't get you.  No.  Hey, Jimmy.  Uh, you're not going to get me.  Hey, Jimmy. 
[03:23:30]  Or maybe that was...  Maybe she actually only said it once and it echoed in that giant asshole.  Some people hated the polka music.  That was hilarious.  They cared if they hated it.  You jerk off in your car to the O&A show.  Stupid.  Enjoy it.  Right.  You should do.  It's hilarious.  Yeah.  And it was the Pennsylvania polka.  Bum, bum, bum.  So it fit.  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  Alright, so...  That to me deserves the internet is for porn.  That would have been also good.  The internet is for porn.  It's for porn.  What were we talking about?  The internet is for porn.  What?  The internet is for porn. 
[03:24:00]  It's for porn.  It's for porn.  It's for porn.  It's for porn.  It's for porn.  It's for porn.  You know, I was thinking what Jeff was thinking.  Go ahead, Jeff.  Yeah.  Make her park, Coach.  Make her park.  Gee, I hope you're not too fond of Angel Beach, Coach.  He's doing Porky's lines.  I know.  I was thinking Porky's through that.  Definitely.  Alright.  Thanks, Jeff.  So, the Robert Downey Jr. CD, Anthony.  I think that's what we were talking about, right?  On instant feedback, I'm being called the Dennis Miller of Steve jokes. 
[03:24:30]  Jackass.  Very funny.  Yeah, that's where we were.  Yes.  So, he's got a CD out.  CD?  Well, I can't wait to hear some of it.  And Liz Smith in the paper today, she writes,  Tonight, I urge you not to miss Robert Downey Jr. on The Tonight Show performing Man Like Me from his first studio CD.  The Futurist.  Oh.  He's doing it live?  On The Tonight Show?  Get a copy of that.  He gets The Tonight Show, Jimmy. 
[03:25:00]  Well, me and him both.  That's true.  Some of the songs on this record were co-written by Downey, and these clearly, and these clearly autobiographical, I know.  I'd have called it Downey Syndrome.  Wouldn't that be a fun name for an album?  It's when you're born retarded because fabric softer got caught in your vag.  These clearly autobiographical ballads reveal a rich introspective talent. 
[03:25:30]  A dopey haircut smells spring fresh.  His voice.  He can't sleep unless he's being put in a circle and it's really hot.  Jesus.  Could you put your son in my clothes?  I have static clink.  Lick the clothes with that fat tongue.  His voice.  And then you do what you normally do in your dolly.  You just throw it out.  Because it's garbage.  Jesus.  Are you insane? 
[03:26:00]  They're insane.  Anthony, his voice is romantically raw, deep and full of emotion.  Romantically raw?  That's called no singing talent.  Deep and full of emotion.  When he gets to the Charlie Chaplin classic smile.  What?  With its call to smile through your heart is aching.  Smile even though it's breaking.  Well, this brilliant actor who has seen his ups and downs knows the material.  Would you rustle up some courage and shoot yourself in the head already? 
[03:26:30]  Like any normal guy that's been through all this crap would do?  We got samples of Robert Downey Jr. singing.  Let's give it a little listen.  This is the one he's going to perform on the Tonight Show.  It's called Man Like Me.  This is a habit I'm breaking now forever.  I'm weary from trying to shake it.  So when I ask if you won't give me your hand, I'll take it right now. 
[03:27:00]  From your mother's side of town.  Can he crash?  Oh, she says you're throwing life away.  Did he rhyme take it with I can't remember what now because it was five seconds ago?  Make it.  Make it.  Break it.  Oh, he just fucking stinks.  Fake it.  What did he rhyme?  Was it ridiculous?  It was something with take it.  Oh, I'm a effective boy. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  I'm a protective boy.  Oh, yeah.  So when I ask if you won't give me your hand, I take it right now.  From your mother's side of town.  Oh, gosh.  Take it, so when I ask if you won't give me your hand, I take it right now, from your  mother's side of town, and she says you're throwing life away.  Turn it off! 
[03:28:00]  All right, all right, I will.  I love that.  Raw!  It was shake it.  Shake it and make it.  Raw.  Raw.  Take it.  Vocals.  He's terrible.  He's doing that affected voice thing.  Forever!  Like, no one talks like that.  If I may, he sounds like Bruce Springsteen with a friggin' tracheotomy.  Yeah.  It's horrible.  It's got that, yeah!  It's sort of a Bruce Springsteen, at the beginning of it, almost Neil Diamond-ish. 
[03:28:30]  A little Dylan, too, right?  Dylan.  You hear the bad Dylan, too?  Yeah, the bad notes are definitely Dylan-influenced.  No, he should be-  No, that's not bad notes.  That is raw, like, what's her face said?  First of all, she should be killed by getting caught between a train and the platform, fat  pandering whore.  And he should be singing, Julian gives good head and is dead, over and over, while he's  pelted with pumpkins.  That's an overrated fuck.  That's good.  Another sample.  This is break it. 
[03:29:00]  Maybe that was just the family.  You fell in love with a broken heart.  Let's go.  Life was just a moment.  Hey, you.  You fell in love with a broken heart.  All right.  This backup group, Ambrosia.  That one was recorded while he was passed out in a child's room. 
[03:29:30]  So that's where the echo you get is actually the big kid room with a little crib in it.  Too bad she didn't fall in love with a broken CD.  You wouldn't have to listen to this.  Stop it, heart on the sleeve, asshole.  You get it.  A sample of the title track, The Futurist.  We'll take the wall.  We'll save the world.  Sounds like October.  A futurist knows. 
[03:30:00]  I'm curious, curious.  Fantasy is cold.  What?  There's a kid.  Okay, already.  You know how this happens, by the way?  He's humming in the car one time, and he sings, and the wormy L.A. assistant goes,  Yeah, really, a good voice, just because they're worms.  They don't know what else to say.  And he'll go, Really?  You think so?  And then they realize, Oh, shit, I have to perpetuate this with more. 
[03:30:30]  You should make a CD.  Yeah, I always thought you were a good singer.  And no one.  Oh, Mike nailed that one.  Can tell them that they stink.  Mike nailed it.  Go ahead, Mike, from Baltimore.  That sounds like bad fucking Corey Hart.  That was Corey Hart.  That was Corey Hart.  Surrender.  That was a stupid song.  Good job.  All right, thank you.  All right.  Yeah, Mike nailed it.  And I don't even know what this one's called.  Kimberly Glide or something like that?  But it's about being hurt. 
[03:31:00]  I bet.  What?  Her arms are cactus angels?  Did he fucking say that?  Now this is a Bruce Cornley type of vibe.  Oh, good.  Oh, he's so groovy.  This sounds like any demo from a local shit band. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  That's what it sounds like.  But he gets to do it on The Tonight Show.  She should take her cactus arm and put it right in his ass.  And I'm sure he'll be a little bit of a better singer.  He stinks.  I saw him like two months ago on some talk show.  I think it was Conan.  Yeah.  And I guess that was when he was thinking about doing something.  I'm thinking the audience probably, whoo, yeah, you should do it.  I'm going to be crazy tonight.  And now it's going to be, well, here he is in a different, you know, kind of a different  thing than you used to sing in a minute.  Great.  Fast Freddy.  Yeah.  Play the autobiographical future classic, Fucked in the Ass at the Big House. 
[03:32:00]  Maybe his prison life has inspired him.  Todd from Kansas.  Go ahead.  God, he makes Clay Hickens sound like Pavarotti.  God, I'm not going to stick an ice pick in my ears.  You know, sir, a little, look, I'm not a comedic genius, but I do know that when the  first one bombs, don't tag it.  Just let it go.  Yeah, he slapped a little tag on that one, hoping it would sell it.  Ice pick in the eye.  That was like the failsafe. 
[03:32:30]  Stuart from Florida.  Ice pick in your throat before you call us, man.  Go ahead, Stuart.  Yeah, the only thing that would make this CD worth listening to is if at the end we get  to listen to him drown in his own comp.  Wow.  Wow.  People are a little angry.  And finally, Anthony, this is the song that Liz thinks is just terrific.  The Charlie Chaplin classic, Smile.  Smile.  Smile.  Aw.  He did silent films.  I bet he thanks his composer.  I want to thank my ranger for this. 
[03:33:00]  Smile.  Shut up.  Though your heart is aching, smile even though it's aching, when there are clouds in the  sky, you get by, you get by, you get by, you get by, you get by, you get by, you get by,  yeah, who cares about clouds in the sky?  It doesn't bother me.  I still get blown.  I'm a fucking jerk.  Rod Stewart laughs at him.  Yeah.  I'm breaking now forever. 
[03:33:30]  Forever.  Forever.  Huh.  I'm ripping off Bruce Springsteen in Jersey.  Why do actors do that shit?  Why?  Stick to the one thing you're good at.  They all want to be, everyone wants to be a rock star.  That's the bottom line.  Rock stars have the job everyone wants.  That's it.  Everyone wants to be a rock star.  And then they want to be actors.  Rock stars want to be actors.  Nobody wants to be what they are. 
[03:34:00]  That's true.  But rock stars can always say they're rock stars, you know?  Yeah.  So this guy, I've had some pain and hurt in my life.  Let me jot it down and put it to some music.  Yeah.  And the people are going to love it.  No, they won't.  Big hand.  Big hand there.  That's wonderful.  Yeah.  I've been thinking of putting out an album myself.  Me and my wife.  What's her wacky name?  Mavis.  Mavis.  Mavis.  Mavis, your arm's like a cactus angel. 
[03:34:30]  I'm going to sing a song.  Hey, hey, my head looks like a skunk.  Hey, hey, it's caused me pain half my life.  I don't laugh at Jay Leno jokes.  Of course you don't.  Of course you're waiting to get that.  Jimmy Norton.  They called me again.  They did.  But only as a possible standby.  They're like for New Year's Eve.  They're like, are you a standby on New Year's Eve?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Just to get a veil.  Just to get a veil.  Just to get a veil.  Not nothing.  They're probably telling like 10, 15 guys.  Yeah.  To see.  But it was just.  That's pretty cool.  It was still nice to get the call. 
[03:35:00]  Farrow, what's up?  I just want to give you guys shit for playing some ass play and then playing this crap.  Now I want to stab on my ears with a pencil.  I know.  That's the beauty of the show.  As opposed to an ice pick pencil.  That's the beauty of the show, though.  We could go from ass effing to bad music.  Yeah, I'm out of here.  We're that talented.  You fell in love with a broken show.  All right.  Here's the deal.  We're going to take a quick break.  We're going to come back.  We got some Paris Hilton stuff we got to get to.  South Park did this Paris Hilton show last night and we got to play a few clips from it. 
[03:35:30]  It's hilarious.  And then we'll also play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Shut your mouth.  I said shut your fucking mouth.  I masturbated so hard.  I almost broke my vagina.  Ha ha.  Bump.  Ha ha.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  XM's 100% commercial-free music channels are now available online at listen.xmradio.com.

[03:37:00]  How you doing today?  What's up, bitch?  What's that?  I said, what's up, bitch?  It's about rich, actually.  Yeah.  I want to let you know that we're focused here in Portland, Oregon, on the energy sector  with natural gas, crude oil, unleaded gas, and heating oil.  We believe in about a week's time we will actually play a situation where a 100-200% return  in a two- to three-month time frame is very realistic in these markets here.  Are you serious, bitch?  Yeah, that's right. 
[03:37:30]  You're just such a loser there that that's the only way you can talk.  Is that right?  Yeah, bitch.  Or is it just because you don't have any money that you just sit there and act like a punk?  Is that why you do that?  Yeah, that's it.  I guess you're at home during the day, so you must be sitting there just watching Playboy  channelers.  Yeah, how did you know?  I wish you had a girlfriend.  You're trying to sell me some crap over the phone, and you're calling me a loser?  You're going to take innocent people's money, some crap.  If it was so good, you would just invest all your money yourself.  Why are you calling people?  What are you doing at home during the day?  That's why I got to wonder.  I'm waiting for you to call. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, is that right?  Yeah.  You got a string of little boys walking through your apartment, don't you?  Yeah.  And your son is the first one.  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, that's right.  You're real clever, aren't you?  Yeah.  I guess I'm just wasting my time with a guy who can't get his ass off the couch in there  in the middle of the day, I guess, right?  Yeah, that's it.  All right.  Why don't you go back to the porno channel, okay, buddy?  All right.  Thanks, bitch.  Sophisticated people invest their money in stock portfolios.  Rednecks invest our money in commemorative plates. 
[03:38:30]  Yeah, that's the legends of NASCAR series right there.  It's probably our personal favorite, Richard Petty hugging his mama.  I can't hardly look at him.  Of course, that's Dale Earnhardt.  He wasn't in a wreck or nothing.  That's just some ketchup on his forehead.  Now you don't have to miss a minute of XM's two-headed baby known as Obie and Anthony.

[03:40:00]  Having a lot of fun today.  Oh, yeah.  God.  Tomorrow's going to be the show of the week, though.  I don't know about that.  Cherry darts.  Cherry darts tomorrow on the Obie and Anthony program. 
[03:40:30]  First 25 to show up outside the studio.  Wherever we're located, I don't know.  111 West 57th Street, something like that.  Between 7th Avenue and 6th Avenue, I think.  Smoothies done.  I see that.  Just look for the store with the big piano inside.  We're upstairs from that.  First 25 people to show tomorrow morning.  We'll throw cherry darts at a fine, fine porn star.  Actually, we've got a couple porn stars, and one listener will walk away with a my-fi. 
[03:41:00]  What's wrong, Jimmy Norton?  What did you do, Jim?  I was walking back in the studio, and I bumped into the little trash can and knocked it over,  and my cereal with the milk was in the garbage, and it spilled, so I followed it.  You spilled the cereal again.  I spilled my cereal again.  You spilled the cereal.  I just didn't see the garbage can.  You need a beating and hot coffee on your breasts.  Or maybe just some raisin bran on my fat tits.  Do we have an update on poor Ben?  He has not called us all day.  Yeah.  I would love an update, and I'm sure the listeners would like to know how our little Ben is feeling. 
[03:41:30]  And I wasn't aware that they served tequila worms in sushi places.  Update on Ben, Steve?  Now both his phones are off, so he's very sick.  Why?  What did you say?  The music always kicks in when you start talking.  I don't know why, but...  I know.  I can't figure that out.  Ben's very sick.  Both phones are off and dumping both into voicemail.  Is he sleeping, you think?  Oh, wow.  I think so.  I think he's in a lot of pain.  I wish he was in here.  We should have spun him in a circle.  Oh.  He's puking and crapping his brains out because he ate bad sushi. 
[03:42:00]  That's what we're hearing.  Yeah.  The reports are in.  Hopefully we'll get an update tomorrow.  Usually that's a 24-hour thing, right?  You got the bad sushi?  I don't know.  I bet he can't even be herky-jerky today.  He's probably like...  Oh, the second he herks or jerks, he craps himself.  He's only herky-ing.  Like a doll that's running out of batteries.  He's just...  His messy hair is all matted down with sweat over his eyes.  Tippy Tom underwear. 
[03:42:30]  The poor guy.  Oh, he's a mess.  He's more of a mess than usual.  Poor little Ben.  Poor Ben.  His little hedgehog body all curled up in a ball as he shivers.  He can't get the sheet to cover his big cock.  Keeps flopping over the side of the bed.  Hits the floor.  Yeah.  All that body hair shedding on his bed sheets.  As he shivers.  Making a little hole in his mattress like a den.  For him to just lay in.  Sweating in it. 
[03:43:00]  Leaning over the bed, just vomiting into his bucket.  Every time he sneezes, he has to change the sheets.  Because he's shitting onto his nice bed.  Shoot.  Flarks.  I bet you when he's in the bathroom, he looks like toothpaste being squeezed from the middle.  Just both ends shooting some type of vile, smelly liquid.  We now go inside Ben's bathroom. 
[03:43:30]  God bless me, dude.  That's insane.  That's nuts.  It's crazy.  It's insane.  Call back to yesterday.  It does.  Oh, that's crazy.  That's nuts.  That's insane, dude.  Dude, my friend in Boston.  As he's clapping.  He's clapping and her.  He doesn't. 
[03:44:00]  He's juking and shitting.  Go socks.  Bad sushi.  That's why the bowl's glowing.  Poor Ben.  That big head.  It's hard to get it completely over the toilet.  Because when he bends over, his skull hits the lid.  So he pukes half on the front of the seat and half in the bowl. 
[03:44:30]  He has to go sideways.  So that big head doesn't hit the fucking, the upturned lid.  He's clanking the septic tank.  Clank.  I think you hate when you're sitting there like, oh, oh, nothing came out.  I go, oh, oh, oh, oh. 
[03:45:00]  And you prepare for your abs, they're hurting.  Oh, and it just is aching.  Poor Ben.  He's been wiping his ass since four o'clock in the morning.  It probably feels like a nice raw, like he rubbed a piece of a potato chip in between,  like a sour cream and onion potato chip in between his tender ass cheeks.  It's all red and sore.  First time his abs have felt any kind of workout.  Yeah.  He's going to come in with a six-pack abs.  All buff.  Little short arms.  That's a disaster.  That's why he can't comb his hair.  His arms are too short. 
[03:45:30]  Poor guy's at home suffering.  Yeah, poor little T-Rex body.  He tries to comb it, but he's herking and jerking, so his hair goes all over the place.  He probably wipes his ass by rubbing it on the rug like a dog does.  It's called scooting.  He's scoot on the rug.  Oh, dude.  Oh, poor guy.  Liquidy, awful dump.  Oh, you know it's just a bad day for him at home.  I'd like to see that guy from Pennsylvania giving it to Ben in his dumper while he's puking. 
[03:46:00]  He can't even shit.  He's so filled to the rim with shame.  He's being brutally raped on the radio.  Wow.  Ben hates when we talk about his personal stuff or his cock.  Oh, I know.  I can't stop talking about it.  I wish he was here.  He hates it.  Yeah.  Oh, that bathroom.  Who's going to clean?  Does he have a maid or something?  I hope so.  A street team of some sort.  A street team.  Looks like he threw a Yoo-Hoo into the ceiling fan.  Someone's got to clean that up. 
[03:46:30]  Oh, that's fucking hilarious.  My second chocolate beverage joke of the day.  And they're both gems.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, that's funny.  It's dripping onto his rug.  Oh, I hope his whole apartment is ruined with his shit and vomit.  I hope he puked into every electronic component he has.  Dude, I got shit in my cell phone. 
[03:47:00]  Poor guy.  The only thing that would make me happier is if I could lift up his sheet and cut one of  my vile farts and then watch his sweaty forehead be too sick to get up and just vomit.  Spray Lysol.  He can't do anything.  He's going to puke like the exorcist.  Just lay there and vomit pee soup in your pillow.  Powerless.  Oh, the poor son of a bitch.  That's awful.  Steve, any...  Just talked to Ben. 
[03:47:30]  He's on his way to the doctor, I believe.  Oh, is he listening?  Yeah, he's listening.  He said, is it you that keeps trying to call me?  Knock it off.  Is he feeling a little bit better?  Not really.  Knock out of the doctor.  He's in bed.  He can't stop sweating.  Can we call out?  So he's back to normal.  That's good.  When can he sweat?  He's one of those guys that would be the polar swimmers who would sweat when he gets out  of the little hole in the ice.  Who's that guy ice fishing naked?  He's sweating.  Oh, he's going to the doctor.  Yeah. 
[03:48:00]  He sounds serious now.  He's fine.  He doesn't sound like he's in good shape.  Has he been taking Pepto-Bismol or something?  Yeah, yeah.  We just want to say hi to him real fast.  He won't.  He sees the number on the cell phone and he just won't pick it up.  And then he calls my other cell and he goes, stop it.  What does he think he is?  Earl?  Yeah.  That sound etiquette?  Oh, God.  Is that funny?  I want him to hold the phone by the bowl while he's releasing.  That's what I want to hear.  Definitely.  Ben isn't that kind of guy, though.  Not at all.  He doesn't like it.  He's very embarrassed.  He's very private about his bodily functions. 
[03:48:30]  His bodily functions.  I remember when we were doing dump stories, he was very uncomfortable.  Very uncomfortable.  He opens the door or the window in the bathroom here and freezes everybody out.  I'll bet you when he was a kid, he was known as Big Doody's Ben.  I'll bet you in kindergarten, he clogged a couple of toilets or he stood up and had  the paper logs that were poking up through the seat and the other boys and girls noticed,  hey, it's Big Doody's Ben.  Stuck with him and gave him a complex.  That's why he sweats so much.  He's always nervous that they're going to stick up and give him away. 
[03:49:00]  They're going to think of my little name that they gave me and taunt me with it.  Big Doody's Ben.  Carlos from Long Island.  Ben's a-hole looks like the back of the Batmobile.  That's good.  I feel bad for him now.  How do you get a doctor's appointment day of?  If it's an emergency, you know, you could kind of give him a call.  I don't have a doctor. 
[03:49:30]  Do you have a primary care physician?  No.  All right, me neither.  No.  All right.  Well, that was an important question for me to ask in the middle of a primary.  Well, let me jot that down.  I'll write it down on this application Jimmy just gave me.  In the middle of, like, a great comic, like, moment, we're all laughing, and I stop it with, like, a dumb, unimportant, boring question.  Ugh, flow killing nothing.  Your primary care physician.  Yeah.  Okay, let's stop at the jokes for a second.  Well, do you have a half-strip?  Fucking bore.  Who cares?  Well, we got the deductible on your prescription plan.  We got South Park Audio. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  They did an episode about Paris Hilton last night.  Now we don't have time to play a lot of this, but I don't know.  It's pretty funny, though.  She comes to South Park.  Of course she does.  And teaches all the girls how to be whores.  Guys are still funny.  Listen to this real fast.  Come on, Wendy, we're going to miss it.  We're going to miss what?  Paris Hilton is making an appearance at the mall.  Who's Paris Hilton?  Who's Paris Hilton?  You don't know. 
[03:50:30]  Hello, everyone.  The guest clothing company is pleased to have as its new spokesperson and model a woman all you young ones can hook up to,  Miss Paris Hilton.  I haven't seen this yet.  I want to see what a whore they made it look like.  Paris, over here!  I don't get it.  What does she do?  She's super rich.  But what does she do?  She's totally spoiled and snobby.  What does she do?  She's a whore.  Hey, everyone.  Sorry if I'm a little fed. 
[03:51:00]  I did a whole lot of partying last night with a lot of different guys.  She coughs out a big giz ball.  Anyway, I'm pleased to be here in Doubt Dark to announce the opening of my brand new store.  A store where girls can buy everything they need to be just like me.  Stupid, spoiled whore.  I guess for the whole episode, what, she's coughing up sperm or something, right?  Eric, every now and then you hear her go,  and this big, massive glob of white stuff comes shooting out on her hand,  and she's got to throw it down on the floor. 
[03:51:30]  Maybe she's got some bad sushi.  Old Paris Sparks.  And then this is the fake commercial for Stupid, Spoiled Whore?  Yeah, in her new store, they have this new little game for the pre-teens  to teach them how to be like Paris Hilton.  Stupid, spoiled whore.  Video places.  We can make things out on the internet.  Yeah!  Stupid, spoiled whore.  Video places.  Show the whole world what a slut you are.  Stupid, spoiled whore video places.  Comes with video camera, night vision filter, play money, 
[03:52:00]  losable cell phone, and 16 hits of ecstasy.  Stupid, spoiled whore.  Video places.  Let everyone see your kush.  I'm pretending to be calling my friends on the cell phone  while my man waits for more sets.  You're a stupid, spoiled whore.  I've got to see this episode.  Yeah, I've got to see that one.  That was a good one.  All right, well.  We've got more.  Maybe we'll play it tomorrow.  We're running out of time.  That's a good song.  Puking and shitting, producer. 
[03:52:30]  You'll never get it out of your tiles.  Greg from Cincinnati.  Ben's nickname today, Old Gravy Leg.  You know how you wipe?  You look down an hour later,  and there's still a smudge on your inner thigh.  Oh, you scratch it,  and then your finger smells,  and you're like,  oh, God. 
[03:53:00]  Old Gravy Leg.  Gravy Leg.  It's Ben.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's Ben.  Hurricane Ben.  Hurricane Ben.  Hurricane Ben sweeps to Florida, just dropping mud on all the houses. 
[03:53:30]  He's probably driving less than he's just going, sons of bitches.  No, he's in the cab.  He's probably got a pair of diapers on so he can make it to the doctor.  Or a plastic baggie from the deli he just tied around and put his little chubby legs through.  I wear DeBenz. 
[03:54:00]  Don't, don't.  Every time he walks in the studio, Ramar, you've got to play the farc.  Hey, old Sparks, here you go.  DeBenz.  DeBenz.  Chubby little ass.  Do you see your pants? It's fantastic. It's crazy.  It's nuts.  Jerry Lee Lewis writes, I'm sure his fever sack is creating a divot in his mattress as we speak.  Fever balls.  Sure.  Hang down.  Well, we can start with, what did we learn? 
[03:54:30]  Keith from Jersey.  I learned, don't take a sick day from the O&A show.  Yeah, that would not be smart.  I guess we could do a little of this.  Well, you know what it is? He's got DeBenz.  Nick from Detroit, what's up?  I wanted to do a what did I learn.  Yeah, let's go.  Today I learned that in Pennsylvania, when they're ready for the balloon knot,  she makes the same noise as Christopher Lloyd getting hit by the steamroller and who framed Roger Rabbit.  Next time, make it a little longer. 
[03:55:00]  Christ.  Hey, morning, boys. Morning, Sugar Bear.  Hi, sweetie pie.  From Ohio, go ahead.  I learned that both Connor Peterson and Connor Peterson references will never get old.  Never.  Rob from Long Island.  A little lump of shattered hope.  Rob from Long Island.  Hey.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  How's my little buddy Jimmy Robinson doing?  I'm good, Phil. How are you?  Okay, I learned two things today.  I learned that the Indians invented the wheel, then threw it on a Chevy, and went drunk driving.  And I learned that Steve Bo Cathy Bates with cherry darts tomorrow.

I learned that children's rooms and assholes both have echoes.  Nice.  Oh.  Very good.  Futtbucker.  Hey, you know what?  By the way, when Ben comes in, we should play cherry darts.  We'll have chocolate-covered cherries.  Jesus.  Futtbucker.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Hi, sweetie.  Hi, fella.  Hey, I learned one thing. 
[03:56:00]  What?  Ben went to the doctor today because he had a Yoo-Hoo overdose.  And also, uh...  And also, uh...  Nice pick in my ear.  A little semi-calling.  Brian from VA, what's up?  Hey, man, I got...  Now I got two I learned.  The first one is I learned I need to get my ass out of bed earlier so I can get the whole  fucking show live.  And then the second one is I learned that we need to start calling Ben Sticky Bun.  Yeah, it's very good.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mitch from Jersey. 
[03:56:30]  Hey, I learned that Jack Nicklaus started, um...  All right.  Not Snyder.  You bastard.  Very good.  All right, good.  Jim from Boston.  I learned that little Jimmy would rather have a big unit in his mouth than on his baseball  team.  Very good.  Very funny.  Clever.  Can I do an impression?  This is, um...  Jack Nicholson, if Ben was his son in The Shining, I'm not gonna hurt or comb one little  hair on his goddamn head. 
[03:57:00]  Ben!  Ben!  Who's Ben?  He's the little boy that shits in my toilet.  I think Ben should go to his doctor.  When do you think maybe Ben should take some ammonium AD?  Steve from Jersey.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Let's go.  Make it fast.  We're in a flow here.  Go.  Got it.  I learned that Ben has the 180s and his blanket covering everything but a thick, delicious  hog. 
[03:57:30]  I'm out.  Jason from New Hampshire.  Hot-ass sex is only hot until the polka music plays.  Yeah.  But it's still funny, though, right?  Sure.  I want to thank Greg Krups for stopping by and I want to thank Ben's Poops for helping  out the show as well today.  Oh, we did that one.  Okay.  Big Poops.  What's that?  It was Big Duties.  Big Duties.  Big Duties, Ben.  Big Duties, Ben.  Hey, Chief from New York.  I learned that 10 inches of cock and the Pennsylvania polka sounds like Thurman Munson's Catcher's 
[03:58:00]  Mitt.  Sorry.  Militant Rabbit from Whack Bag.  I learned part six of the show was subtitled, What a Croc of Murder.  Croc of Murder.  Dan G. from PA.  I learned that you guys are on XFM, not XM, and I also learned we have a new hairstyle  for What's in My Pants, long and wavy, also known as the Pennsylvania Perm.  Daniel from Alabama.  I learned today that Cactus Arms is the newest message board name.  Whoa, okay.  Sparks.

I learned the Olsen twins are from Whoville.  Peter from Whack Bag.  I learned that Godsmack gets tossed in the river, and Robert Downey Jr. gets national airplay.  That's very good.  Good one.

[03:59:00]  And George from Philly, I learned today, Opie and Anthony, the Opie and Anthony show  was titled Hickory Dickory Murder.  M-C-M-L-X-X-V-I-I.  We're out of here?  The Quinn Martin production epilogue.  Oh, eight, nine.  Well, tomorrow, cherry darts for my five.  First 25 people outside the studio will get to throw darts.  Cherry darts at the Porn Stars.  Bye-bye.

[04:00:30]  Void where prohibited.  I don't understand anything, so there you go.  You know my problem?  I watch too much news, man.  That's why I'm so depressed all the time.  I figured it out.  I watch too much CNN, man.  I don't know if you've ever sat around and watched CNN longer than, say, 20 hours in one day.  I don't recommend that.  Watch CNN headline news for one hour.  It's the most depressing thing you'll ever fucking do.  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression. 
[04:01:00]  War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless.  Then you look out your window.  Where's all this shit happening?  Ted Turner's making this shit up, man.  Jane Fonda won't sleep with him.  He runs to a typewriter.  By 1992, we will all die of AIDS.  Read that on the air.  I don't get laid.  No one gets laid. 
[04:01:30]  I'm writing, Jane Fonda.  Will you fuck this guy so we can get some good news, please?  I want to see a well-laid Ted Turner newscast.  Hey, it's all going to work out.  Here's sports.  This is the nicest part of the South.  This is like the only part of the South you go, like, when I come there, nobody goes,  man, I wish you could take me back to New York with you.

Get the fuck out of here, man.  It's hot every day.  90 degrees and shit.  It's hotter than 10 niggas in a Volkswagen.
