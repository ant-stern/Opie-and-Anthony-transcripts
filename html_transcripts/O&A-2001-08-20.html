<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of the website Bighugeparty.com/prices/priceless, showcasing embarrassing photos, many sexually explicit.  A caller, Barbara, praised a previous Celine Dion bit. This led to a discussion of someone impersonating Anthony at a strip club, Lace and Nyack, allegedly receiving free drinks and lap dances. Callers from the opanthony.com message board offered conflicting accounts of this event.  The hosts then announced they received two Janet Jackson concert tickets and decided to destroy them.  The conversation shifted to Anthony's visit to a Renaissance Fair, prompting numerous callers to share sexually suggestive anecdotes about their own Renaissance Fair experiences, including descriptions of costumes and interactions with performers.  The "Oliver Syndrome" (the addition of a child character to a sitcom leading to its cancellation) and the E! True Hollywood Story on *Growing Pains*, focusing on Kirk Cameron's religious conversion and the cast's personal lives, were discussed extensively. A caller recounted a personal encounter with Kirk Cameron's wife.  The show concluded this segment with audio clips from a previous "55-gallon drum challenge," featuring women subjected to unpleasant substances.

The next segment featured several callers recounting negative concert experiences with David Cassidy, Van Morrison (described as playing with his back to the audience and using profane language through his harmonica), and Bob Dylan, all allegedly failing to play their popular songs.  The conversation moved to Lifetime movies, with callers criticizing their melodramatic plots involving abuse and infidelity, and making crude jokes about actresses like Meredith Baxter Birney, Markie Post, and Ted Danson. A caller contrasted these negative experiences with a positive encounter with Geddy Lee of Rush.  The hosts then discussed bands touring with non-original members, citing examples like The Coasters and Rat. A caller shared a humorous story about a disappointing Barry Williams concert. The segment ended with a seemingly staged, chaotic confrontation between the hosts and a radio personality, "Rock Hall," at a blood drive in Natick, MA, filled with offensive language including racial slurs and homophobic remarks.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on the ongoing feud between Opie and Anthony and their former station, WAAF ("AF"), specifically targeting a WAAF personality, "Rocko."  The hosts detailed a planned ambush of Rocko during a WAAF blood drive at the Crown Plaza Hotel in Natick, Massachusetts, involving shouting, cursing, and encouraging listeners to throw old WAAF merchandise. Numerous callers described their participation and the WAAF staff's reaction, including the station abruptly switching to music and commercials.  The "55-gallon drum challenge" audio clips were replayed, along with listener-submitted comments, discussions of Johnny Knoxville's career, and childhood anecdotes about fire.  The hosts also interspersed promotional spots for Stacker 2 and Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed.  Several callers shared their experiences relating to the WAAF ambush.

The final excerpt covered a potential (or feigned) suspension and vacation time for the hosts.  They mentioned co-host Rocko possibly pre-recording his break to get pizza faster. Listener calls included comments like "small breasts are not gratuitous," a mention of a 70-year-old in tights, and a story about spousal abuse. The hosts promoted upcoming segments, including a "Chandra Levy Challenge" and Mario Cantone's appearance.  The segment concluded with advertisements for Rockaway Bedding, emphasizing low prices, various mattress brands, free delivery and old mattress removal, and mentioning Meredith Baxter's appearance in Bernie's commercials.

Yeah.  I'm sure you can find it. 
[00:02:30]  Just go to BigHugeParty.com.  All right.  We haven't gotten to the phones yet.  Let's talk to Barbara.  Barbara, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  I just wanted to call you guys and tell you I've had a really crappy week.  And you guys had me laughing my ass off over that Celine Dion bit.  It was hysterical.  You're like Celine.  Is it Friday already?  No.  It was that last week.  I listen to you guys almost every day.  I try and listen to you guys on the way home from work.  And you guys just crack the hell out of me.  I'm sitting here.  I'm off on Mondays usually.  And I'm home here in the afternoon listening to you. 
[00:03:00]  And I just cracked up laughing.  You made my day.  Oh, thank you.  I just want to call and let you know that.  Thank you, Barbara.  Okay.  All right.  Take care.  Look at T-Bag.  Did you go to T-Bag?  Where's T-Bag?  Oh, my God.  BigHugeParty.com.  It's the third column.  Priceless moment.  Down at the bottom.  T-Bag.  T-Bag.  Let me see.  Oh, yeah.  What's the Yambag?  Fill her up is a good one.  What's Yambag?  I don't get it.  Oh. 
[00:03:30]  Which row is that?  Go to Yambag.  It's like three dudes at a concert or maybe tailgating before a football game.  Can't really tell.  Which column?  And they all got their beers and their cigarettes.  And one guy, you know, has his junk just stuffed through his fly.  This guy T-Bag and his friend.  Oh, Dave Matthews concert.  There it is.  Okay.  Yambag.  That's a...  He's got his bag hanging out.  Uh-oh.  We're not getting syndicated calls again. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  I got a problem.  Got to address it right away.  Go ahead.  Ah.  You know, who the hell...  What happened?  Sales guy calls down.  Ben took the call from sales upstairs.  Sales guy calls and goes,  Hey, did any of you guys go to Lace and Nyack over the weekend?  I said, I really don't think so.  He goes, yeah, well, Anthony was there.  With a huge crew of people, right?  Mm-hmm.  Strakes were comped.  Dances were comped.  Turn to you. 
[00:04:30]  You weren't there.  No, I wasn't there.  I know that there was a party that was going on there.  I didn't go.  But if somebody was there saying they're me and getting comped on all kinds of crap,  you know, that ain't right.  I think the people that put the party together and they know who they are,  better do some investigating and find out who was saying they were me to get comped.  I don't even get comped at strip clubs.  You know?  Well, who put...  I take care of the girls.  Who put the party together?  It was opanthony.com message board. 
[00:05:00]  The message board people.  Put it together.  I couldn't make it.  And obviously somebody took it upon themselves to say they were me anyway  and get free stuff.  For everyone?  I don't know.  This is the first I've heard of it.  And let me tell you something.  If it was enough that the club called our sales department,  they must have shelled out quite a bit of dances and booze,  thinking it was me when it wasn't me.  How much was comped? 
[00:05:30]  The guy said he was Anthony.  I want to hear it.  He said it was a big posse of people and a lot of drinks.  I mean, yeah, you're right.  They wouldn't call, you know.  Oh, if it was just a couple of bucks or something like that, they wouldn't call.  But, you know, because when that happens, of course they're going to call sales  and go, hey, how about a couple of mentions on the air or something?  You know, we took care of your boys.  No, you didn't.  I didn't go.  It wasn't me.  Let's find out how much they spent.  I'd love to know.  And you're a good name.  Call up.  Get the sales guy on the line, all right?  Or even Laces. 
[00:06:00]  Call up there.  See what the hell.  Aaron, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  How we doing?  All right.  Listen, I got stuck with two tickets for that Janet Jackson concert.  I was wondering if you guys wanted to use that in any way you felt appropriate.  Yeah, bring them up to the station.  We'll rip them up.  Yeah?  Yeah.  We're going to rip them up, you guys.  We'll rip them up.  What do you guys get, 56?  You're breaking up, bro.  Where are you at?  56th Street?  56, yeah.  All right, cool, man.  See you guys up there.  All right, cool.  What are we going to do with Janet Jackson? 
[00:06:30]  Janet Jackson.  Who the hell cares?  Strawberry, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, guys.  I was wanting the people to help set it up.  It was a birthday party for Froy.  Uh-huh.  But no one pretended to be you.  They knew ahead of time that Froy was 19, and the owner said the only reason why he's  letting him in is because he was the founder of Foundry, and it was a courtesy because  the message board is advertised on your radio station.  So no one pretended to be Ant, and the only drinks they caught...  Wait a minute, Strawberry, how do you know nobody pretended to be me? 
[00:07:00]  Because none of us did.  I mean, they did give us drinks.  They gave us one free drink for each of us, but that was because of the hard time they  initially...  The doorman initially gave Froy because he's 19, and it's 21 plus.  Well, that's why he's giving them a hard time.  Yeah.  You can't just let a 19-year-old kid into a strip club.  Oh, no.  All I know is the club called up our sales department and said that somebody said he was  me and got comped for a lot of booze and a lot of lap dances. 
[00:07:30]  No, I mean, we did get the 20 drinks free because it was one free drink for each person attending, but that  was because the doorman didn't know that it was arranged ahead of time for Froy to get  in, and he had given Froy a real hard time because Froy's only 19.  So then the owner came out...  It is so obvious now what she's saying is that they were having trouble.  Somebody called up, claiming to be you, to get him inside the club.  It's the only way it could work.  Is that what happened?  It's got to be it.  I don't know, because I called ahead of time, and the guy said, no, I really can't do it 
[00:08:00]  because Froy's 19.  Right.  And I was like, fine.  Hey, let's say we're Anthony, and maybe that'll get us in the door, which is what you guys  did.  You guys suck.  Don't do that club.  No, we didn't do that.  I personally didn't.  I don't know of anyone there that did.  I'll wait and get to the bottom of it, but...  I know what we ended up doing was we said, okay, let's go, and then I'm going  I called again and said, you know, reserve the front seat, and there's about 20 of us  coming in, and the owner said, no problem, and when we got there, I guess the owner didn't 
[00:08:30]  tell the doorman, and he was given Froy a problem, and I'm like, no, this was taken care of because  I personally called, and then the guy got the owner, and he's like, yeah, I remember.  Hold on, I'm getting confused, and now I'm just waiting to get to the bottom of it.  That's all.  That's all I know of it.  That's all.  I'm sorry.  I mean, I don't know of anyone who did that.  Well...  If it was done, it's completely wrong, but I personally don't know of anyone who did that.  We'll see.  We'll see.  Well, the club is definitely pissed off. 
[00:09:00]  They seem to be okay, but, I mean, the owner came and said, I'm sorry, I remembered you  called.  I forgot to tell the doorman, blah, blah, blah.  Please come in.  All right.  That was it.  I'm sorry, guys, if anyone did that, but that's not anything that I know of.  All right, Strawberry.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  Here's the birthday boy now.  Froy.  Yeah, look.  Listen.  What's up, man?  Nobody said that they were you.  Okay.  I went in.  They gave me a hard time, so we went back out of the parking lot.  We were all going to leave, go up to Stiletto, which was 18 plus, and I wouldn't have any 
[00:09:30]  trouble getting in.  Yeah.  The owner came out and said, are you guys Opie and Anthony?  And we all looked at each other and said, no, we're not.  We said, we're the message board.  We're a website for them.  Uh-huh.  He said, is Opie here?  Is Anthony here?  And we said, no.  Neither of them are here.  We're not affiliated with the show.  We're just a message board.  Uh-huh.  Nobody pretended to be you.  Nobody pretended to be Opie.  Okay.  If anybody did, they weren't with us.  You know, I will completely believe you.  I'll talk to the people at Lace's. 
[00:10:00]  Can we get them on the phone?  And we'll see what they say.  Yeah, where are they?  We're working on them.  All right.  Are you?  Because even, they were buying me lap dances for my birthday, and, you know, the girl's  like, oh, where's Opie or Anthony?  I said, you know, they're not here.  You know, I don't know where they are.  Maybe they're in the city.  But, you know, nobody pretended to be you or, you know, even dropped your name.  We made it very clear.  All right, Fred.  Ben, did you have fun?  Oh, I had a great time.  What the sales guy said is, and he's getting more info and stuff, but he said that a limo  pulled up, and the owner of the place, for some reason, someone said something to the 
[00:10:30]  effect that Anthony or something, and that's why they got comped and all this stuff.  A limo?  But a limo pulled up.  I wish I went in a limo.  Someone said they were Anthony, and they comped the drinks, and yada, yada, yada.  But we'll get more info.  All right, we'll get to the bottom.  Now, there was no limo with us at all.  And we all went in separate cars, and we drove up to dinner at the mall, went over  there, and, you know, all our separate cars, nobody had a limo.  You know, nobody said they were used. 
[00:11:00]  The only drinks we got for free was a drink per person, because they gave us a hard time.  They waived the cover charge.  That was it.  All right.  All right, Fred.  All right?  All right, man.  Take it easy.  Later.  Later.  That's all right.  Oh, you're right?  Okay.  Nothing.  All right.  Well, we'll get to the bottom of it.  That's all.  That's the gang from opanthony.com.  If that, I have no reason not to believe Froy.  Now, they've got lots of things to talk about on their message board today.  I just want to see if somebody was, you know, maybe it had nothing to do with the party that 
[00:11:30]  was going on, but if somebody was down there, pulled up in a limo, and was using my name.  Someone pulled up in a limo, because that's the whole part of the story.  Now, I'm curious.  We've got to get to the bottom of it.  I'm Anthony.  Also, check out whackbag.com as well, all right?  A couple message boards that help out the radio show.  Where are we going now?  Let's go to Pete.  Hey, Pete, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yo, what's up, fellas?  What's up?  Yo, ask Anthony where he was yesterday. 
[00:12:00]  Where I was yesterday.  I was at the Renaissance Fair.  Yes, you were.  In tuxedo.  Ye old faggot.  Faggot.  Dude, I'm that big, fat bastard you saw right first thing in the morning.  Dude, ye old faggot.  You work there.  Dude, I get paid to be there.  Yeah.  You get paid to stand around in your little costume.  It's not little.  I'm about 350 pounds.  I know.  I remember you.  And talk in a fake English accent.  I didn't talk in an accent.  Come on, man.  Not to me.  Hey, Pete, what's your job at the Renaissance Fair? 
[00:12:30]  My father-in-law makes jewelry.  I sell it.  Nice tights, Dick.  Well, at least it's a little better than pumpkin picking, though.  Yeah, I had a good time.  It was, you know, interesting walking around.  Don't get me involved with this.  I'm not abusing you.  Yeah, really.  This guy's just looking to abuse somebody.  I know.  All right, Pete.  All right, fellas.  Bye.  Take it easy.  I walk up.  He's like, hey, how you doing?  I think what's up?  It was all nice and fine yesterday.  Now, today I'm a faggot. 
[00:13:00]  The Renaissance Fair, huh?  Yeah.  Went to get a big old turkey leg to gnaw on.  I got a steak on a steak is what I was eating.  Steak on a steak.  Steak on a steak.  Steak on a steak.  And then I had to go to ye olde teller machine, ye olde ATM, get some money.  Kind of takes away from the whole atmosphere when you walk up to buy a little doodad or something.  And they got to slide your Amex card through a wireless, ye olde wireless credit card scanner. 
[00:13:30]  You know?  Did you have to ask someone where the bathroom was and they just have to make it a big old scene?  Will thou be taking a bath?  No.  No.  I got to go to the bathroom.  Oh, a bath?  We do not have baths here.  Um, well, where do you, you know, take a leak?  A leak.  Oh, thou would be looking for the privy.  The privy.  The privy's a portosan that you find on construction sites. 
[00:14:00]  I don't think they had that around the castle.  I don't think they had the privy portosan.  You get a little carried away with yourself.  You see a bunch of cleavage, Anthony?  Yeah, you get the cleavage there, the girls with the cans popping out.  I got to sign a few.  Yeah?  A few teas, yeah.  Nice.  It's kind of nice.  Some girls that were selling beer.  I got a couple of free beers.  See, I say I'm Anthony and I get free beer at a renaissance fair, not at strip clubs. 
[00:14:30]  A little different.  Just a tad.  Ah, Chris, what's going on?  Yeah, the strip club thing.  These guys are so full of it if they say they didn't use your name.  What owner's going to put them in if they weren't using your name?  Just, hey, I'm some 19-year-old kid who works on a message board and they'll let me in.  They're not going to do that.  They're full of it.  Oh, look at you being Columbo.  Cut these guys off.  Don't let them even ever talk to you again.  That's a good point.  They wouldn't have got in if they hadn't used your name.  So what if Troy would line his ass off?  Yeah, what's your club owner is going to take a chance of letting a 19-year-old kid in? 
[00:15:00]  Exactly.  It's just you guys.  Right.  So they're lying.  They're full of it.  All right, we'll get to the bottom of it.  Yeah, cut them off, man.  Just one of the things we'll have to figure out by the end of the show today.  Absolutely, man.  I know who it was that said they were Anthony.  It was Ken Stevens.  Is that true?  Our own general manager, Ken Stevens.  Brenda, what's going on?  Hey, I just wanted to know why Anthony didn't come by for a comp psychic reading at the rent fair. 
[00:15:30]  I would have given it to him.  Call me now.  Call me now, Mrs. Cleo.  Those psychic readings.  I've worked there for 10 years, and everybody up there is crazy.  Let me tell you, the last person that I saw get a psychic reading at a Renaissance Festival,  it was my ex-wife up in Massachusetts, and they said we were going to have a wonderful marriage with lots of kids.  Oh, yeah, real happy, real happy.  Call me now.  It ain't going to happen.  You'd be better off trying to tell the future from a Ken Griffey card. 
[00:16:00]  Brenda, do you know what you're doing when you do these tarot card readings?  Yes, I do.  Oh, come on.  I've been doing it for 10 years now.  And you can see people's future?  You tell them what's going to happen?  Come on.  Be honest.  I'm honest.  It's for entertainment value only.  No, it's not for entertainment.  You have no magic power over telling people's future.  I only tell what I see in the cards, though.  And what is it?  Is it always good, or do you tell people they're going to die, or what?  I've never told anybody they're going to die, but I told one woman she's going to be getting a divorce soon. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, yeah?  That was a big thing.  Boy, what are the odds?  Someone getting divorced in this time.  Yeah, right.  This age.  And what, was she walking in, and, you know, do you ask them questions at first?  Like, what do you want to know about?  No, I don't ask any questions.  I want to know about my marriage.  Uh-oh.  Well, you know, I'm looking at the cards, and the tears streaming down your face.  The look on your face.  I don't buy it. 
[00:17:00]  Thank you, Brenda.  Hey, it's just extra money on the side.  That's all right.  Call me now.  Call me now.  There she goes, Brenda.  Hey, Rich, what's up?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  All right, listen.  These guys that went to this strip club, if somebody says, if it's a bunch of regular  guys hanging out, and somebody says, oh, you know, are you with a celebrity?  There's no way a bunch of regular guys are going to say no.  They're going to go, oh, yeah, we're with him.  Oh, he's on his way.  You know, he's going to be hanging out.  There's no way.  They're definitely using your name.  I don't know.  I'll see. 
[00:17:30]  I'll find out.  I'll talk to you.  I mean, not that you're a celebrity or nothing.  I know.  Keep me grounded.  Definitely a ye olde faggot, now that I've found out.  Ye olde.  Ye olde.  Yeah.  All right, fellas.  All right.  What happened to that olde?  Ye olde.  You just don't use it now.  Ye olde this and ye olde that.  You only see it at the Renaissance fairs.  And some of these guys, you know something, the guys that dress up, see those guys?  They dress up.  They all do.  Why would you dress up as the guy with the tights and the junk? 
[00:18:00]  There's one guy.  He works there, I guess.  He's doing some.  I don't think they have a choice.  It's probably a head ye olde that tells you what you're going to be.  And you're ye big junk guy?  Ye big junk in the tights guy?  No.  This one guy, he does a great trick.  He stands on a ladder, and it's just a single ladder.  Like you would have to lean it up against the building to climb on it.  But he stands straight up, climbs this thing, just balancing on two legs of the ladder. 
[00:18:30]  And it would be great.  You would look at it and go, wow, that is really impressive.  The guy's really talented.  If it wasn't for the entire time, you're going, put something over your junk?  The guy is in tights, and he's got a regulation softball shoved down his pants.  Yeah, but if you're going to be the guy in the tights, aren't you going to pack a little bit?  No, you know what?  You don't want to see it.  For the love of God, there are children around.  Why doesn't Bill O'Reilly get on the Renaissance fairs and talk about the guys with the tights and junk? 
[00:19:00]  If I'm tight guy, I'm making sure it looks good.  I'm packing.  There's the guys that don't want to make the whole commitment.  You know, they might get the hat.  They might get some boots.  But they're wearing jean shorts.  I don't remember ye olde jean shorts.  If you're going to do it, go all out.  Go all out.  Or don't do it at all.  Hey, Carrie, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Pretty good.  I work at the New York Renaissance fairs, one of the actresses.  Who are you? 
[00:19:30]  I play Lady Penelope Devorah, one of the ladies in Waiting to the Queen.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, and we actually try to throw in, like, sound bites from the show during the day.  Really?  Yeah, during the chess game.  There's this one time when the actors are beating each other, and they stop for a second,  and the archbishop tries shouting, don't just stare at him, beat him.  Oh, really?  Yeah, and one of the actresses also pretends that she's having a baby, and the queen can't know about it.  So we always go, when's that baby do?  You know, I heard that the guy that plays Robin Hood up there, that he shaved Wow into one of the sheeps. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah, we do.  We have Wow on the back of our sheep called Huzzah.  Yeah, I didn't see the sheep, but people were telling me, yeah, it's a sheep, and they put Wow in there.  Well, he likes to butt people, so we can't have him out in the public.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, but we love you guys there so much.  I noticed a lot of Opie and Anthony fans there, and it got me some free beer.  All right. 
[00:20:30]  Thank you, Carrie.  You're welcome.  All right.  The old look what I did to you again.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, man.  Hey, if I was up there Saturday, wasn't that you in a jester's hat and the little shoes that are curled up with the bells on the toes?  Yeah.  Yeah, I had the bells.  Like, who would be that guy?  Some guys go to the Renaissance Fair in costume.  If you're going to go, no.  If you're going to go in costume, do it up.  Be like the guy that goes around just hacking people's heads off or something. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, you're the ye olde gay blade.  Ye olde gay blade.  You know, why are you the tight guy with the junk?  Why are you junk tights guy?  Hey, George.  What's up?  I'm the Shakespearean guy with the tights and the junk, and he's poeting.  Poeting.  Is that what it's called?  He's the poetry guy.  Poeting sounds good.  Doing poeting.  Hey, George.  What's up, guys?  What up?  I was there last year.  My girlfriend, she's in one of those shops trying on that leather stuff they sell over there.  Yeah.  They got some guy walking around.  He's an older guy with a dragon slayer. 
[00:21:30]  They got big blood on him.  So I say, how's the dragon business?  Oh, really good.  But there's one dragon that took my wife.  I'm like, what happened?  Oh, cancer.  Then he starts telling me he lost his wife.  He's got the whole act, and he's doing the whole thing.  I lost my wife to cancer and everything.  I'm like, thanks for ruining my day, Dick.  All right, guys.  Have a good one.  All right, man.  I'll tell you one thing.  They had this store where you could buy these little, these girls buy these little leather skirts that are really tight, like tattered, very short mini skirts, tight little halter tops that bind in the front made out of leather. 
[00:22:00]  There was a girl working there.  Oh, my God.  She was very, very hot, wearing little wings.  And she's walking around, and it's just a distraction.  It's a complete distraction.  What's wrong with that?  Tony.  But then there's other girls going in there that might not have any business going in that store. 
[00:22:30]  I hear you.  Tony.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, Ann.  How good does it feel to tell a woman, give me a beer, wench?  They don't like that up there, right?  No, they hate that, man.  Yeah.  Well, they goof on everybody.  All right.  They can't all be home runs.  Sorry, guys.  Punch it out, Maverick.  Punch out.  You're in a flat spin.  Hey, Tom.  Tom.  Tom, what's up?  We lose you, Tom.  Hello?  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up, Tom?  Hey, no, this is Paul.  I play the archbishop at the fair.  Oh, you're the archbishop guy? 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, and let me just tell you, when you're walking around with the royalty, and all those  girls that have all that breast just spilling over the top, and they always want to bow  down to you, that's worth it right there, let me tell you.  Good times.  How long have you been doing the Renaissance Fair?  Just for two years.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't know.  It's good times.  You wear tight, but you see a lot of boob, so it's good times.  Cool.  Yeah.  Thank you, Tom.  No problem.  I bet you're going to party like crazy when it's all said and done, though. 
[00:23:30]  There are some messes there, too.  Like, I mean, there are some women that are so huge, and their boobs are so huge, and they  cinch them up, and it looks like jello resting on top.  There's a huge...  Oh, I know what you're talking about.  Yeah, and it just...  Hey, Joe.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  The best part about those fairs is that you get the real hardcore people that actually  think they're still living in that age.  Yeah.  And, like, you catch them on break, like, we're out of costume or something, and they,  like, try to hide behind a tree. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, they've got to do the accent and everything.  They really get into it.  Yeah, no...  So, how are my lady and my lord this afternoon?  Could I have my Sam, or can I have my bod, or just get...  Would you like a yard of that?  This brings back a memory.  Did they break out a character to say, hey, man, you're Anthony from the...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You get that.  Yeah.  Remember from Spooky World up in Massachusetts?  Spooky World! 
[00:24:30]  Spooky World!  This is a place, Halloween comes around, and up in Massachusetts, they've got a place called  Spooky World.  It's like a haunted house and haunted hayride and whatnot.  They do it at Foxborough.  Yeah.  So, we're going through it, me and Opie and the girls and stuff.  And you'll hear, they have live people inside that scare you.  It's not just machines and whatnot.  People touch you.  They come around from corners, boo, and they really get into it, and they really try to  scare you.  And so, we went, and we wanted to, you know, hopefully get scared, or at least have a good  time.  Experience what they had up there. 
[00:25:00]  You know?  And we come around the corner, and it's like, ha!  Love the show, O and A.  I'm like, ah, thank you.  Thank you, ghoul.  And then they spread the word, so by the time we're through, it's like, this sucks.  Yeah, they're going through, and go, hey, man.  You heard me cracking up yesterday.  I was like, oh, no, Frankenstein!  Frankenstein, stop it!  Scare our ladies.  Do something scary, please.  That's why we're here.  The guy pops out of the coffin, he's like, oh, boo! 
[00:25:30]  You guys, last Wednesday, I got wowed.  I was like, ah, the ghoul got wowed.  Yeah.  All right.  We should take a break.  Hey, those 55-gallon drum clips from late last week.  The horrifying screams of terror, yeah.  Went over very well that Rick got a few more from that show, just to give you a little  taste.  You want to set this up again, Anthony?  We had, what, seven or eight barrels in here.  We had the ladies inside these barrels.  It's called the 55-gallon drum challenge.  Not, you know, then there's a few holes so we could dump stuff. 
[00:26:00]  Dump stuff in.  And the object was to stay in the barrel longer than any of the other girls.  And we were pouring some heinous stuff in there.  And we played the hissing cockroaches last week.  Yeah, and that was screams of horror.  That was the showstopper for the 55-gallon drum challenge.  But we have a few more clips of the whole thing.  All right.  What's clip number one?  You know a fan, Rick?  Just dumping of more, I think, fish guts and stuff.  Lots of fish guts.  Was it the Popeye Surprise?  It could be Popeye Surprise.  Which was pretty much chum.  Chum.  All right.  Let's just go to the clip and see what it is. 
[00:26:30]  All right.  Well, maybe one of the other girls would like some.  Yeah.  Tabitha.  No.  Tabitha.  Oh, my balls.  Oh, my balls.  Oh, my balls.  Wow.  My balls.  Oh.  We've broken Tabitha, Anthony.  She was so rambunctious.  Compare the audience from the beginning of the show.  We have broken her.  This is so nasty.  She was so rambunctious at the beginning of this. 
[00:27:00]  She was fighting back and everything.  And now she's just sitting there in the fetal position.  There's eyeballs on it.  Yeah.  There's eyeballs on Tabitha.  Tabitha's got the fish eyes.  Yeah.  God damn, it stinks in here, man.  It's really stinking now.  I can only imagine what it smells like in the barrel.  How you doing, Jane?  Jane?  Yeah?  You know what that is?  Um, no.  Let her rip.  Let her rip, man.  With the fish juice and everything.  Yeah, everything.  All right.  Just dump it.  Dump it.  Dump it.  Right in Jane's pail.  There you go, Jane.  Oh, God. 
[00:27:30]  Ow!  Wait!  Ow!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  All right.  Go nuts, guys.  How about that big one?  See that big one?  Oh, my God!  Wendy doesn't like those.  Yeah, Wendy is, uh...  Wendy doesn't like the little fish.  Maybe she'll like that big one.  Wendy is having a tough time with the Popeye surprise.  Take the big...  That big one.  Yeah, that one.  Yeah, get the biggie.  Dump that right in Wendy's tank.  Come on!  Wendy!  There you go, Wendy. 
[00:28:00]  Oh, it barely fits through the hole.  Yeah, just squeeze it through.  Squish it through.  Squish it through.  Oh, my God!  It's another fish!  That was a whopper!  There is a ton of dead sea life in the barrels now.  How about some surf and turf?  Yeah, why don't you throw that in there?  A little turf for the surf and turf.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God!  That stinks!  Holy cow, that stinks!  Wow, the clams really smell bad.  Oh, God, that stuff is so... 
[00:28:30]  I don't know what that is.  Get it in there quick, though.  And don't spill it anywhere.  Dude, that is the worst.  What the hell is it?  Dude, it's some kind of fish chum paste.  Don't put it on her hand too much, because she'll fling it.  I'm looking for toilet training books.  Everybody poops is still the standard, of course.  We've also got the less popular Nobody Poops But You. 
[00:29:00]  What can't we?  Oh, then you want your naughty child, and that's concentrated evil coming out the back of you.  We hope we end Anthony's show.  I need to go poopies!

[00:30:30]  Hey.  Hey.  When you guys were talking about the Titanic inflatable kids ride, did you guys actually see it?  Yeah.  That thing is huge.  It's the size of a house.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's got to be two or three stories high.  Yeah.  Also, did yours have the iceberg at the other end to stop the kids from, like, continuing on the ground?  Is that a new addition?  The iceberg?  Yeah.  That was the one I saw by me.  See, because...  That's great.  We brought this up many times on the show, but I saw a picture of the Titanic slide in the paper, and I really thought it was kind of a goof thing. 
[00:31:00]  You know, I didn't think people would really rent this thing, but I was driving home into Huntington, and someone was having a backyard party, and there was the huge two- to three-story Titanic slide.  Yeah, I mean, I drove by, and there was a guy standing next to it, and I realized the thing had to be at least 20 feet high, if not more.  It's huge, and we talked to a guy that rents it out, and he said that it's a huge thing at parties, and people love it.  The parents love it, and these are probably the same parents that would be offended by this show, and that's probably one of the most offensive things. 
[00:31:30]  You're making a ride out of something that thousands of people died on, you know?  Yeah, and it's funny, because only half of it, you know, is tilted up, and the other half, supposedly, you know, is under the lawn, because it's under the water, and the kids slide and try to miss the smokestacks.  Yeah, and in your version, they hit an iceberg at the end to stop them from sliding down the driveway? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, basically, at the other end, you go down, and then there's probably like 10 feet, and then an iceberg.  That's great.  I'm sure when people were shivering their last shiver before death set in, in the icy waters, they thought that, they never thought that in almost 100 years, kids would be sliding into rubber icebergs to stop themselves on a ride.  Cute.  Great.  All right, Paul, thank you.  Yeah, no problem.  It's real, and it's hot.  People are digging that one.  Carolyn.  Hey, how are you?  Oh, no, this is Caroline, Brian. 
[00:32:30]  What's up, Caroline?  I was just wondering if either of you saw the E! True Hollywood story on Growing Pains.  Hell, yeah.  That was some great TV.  That was a good one.  That was great TV last night.  God, I missed it.  Kirk Cameron screwed up the whole damn sitcom.  By becoming a religious fanatic.  Who knew?  He finds, check this out, Anthony.  Oh, no.  Kirk Cameron finds God in his real life and decides that his sitcom character could not lie to his parents anymore, because he found Jesus.  Because he found Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. 
[00:33:00]  So then he would look at scripts, because his whole gig on the show, his whole gig was to lie and, you know, kind of...  Denive.  Denive and sneak around his parents.  It's really one of the most unique ways of a teenager rebelling, why he didn't just start robbing convenience stores like the other teenage sitcom star that I know.  Yeah, really, doing drugs.  He seems like a kook.  He went the other way, but my favorite was the bitter ex-playmate who was his former girlfriend on the show.  Oh, that hot piece of ass.  What was her name again?  I don't know what her name was, but she was mad. 
[00:33:30]  You know who got a fire from the show, but they can't completely prove it, was Kirk Cameron.  Right.  After he found God, he's like, I can't be, you know, I can't have a girl that's my girlfriend on the show that posed naked in Playboy.  Are you kidding?  What happened to this guy that he went all religious?  So blonde.  Her name on the show, I think they said was Julie.  Yeah, Julie.  I don't know what her real name was.  Whatever, but she was so hot.  And yeah, they wrote her off the show out of nowhere, if you remember.  And the reason was because Kirk Cameron didn't want to be seen with her. 
[00:34:00]  Oh.  Because it was bad for his new image after he found God.  And then you had Tracy Gold with the anorexia.  Yeah, there's a lot to cover in that show.  Who knew?  And they invited her back for the final show because they just felt like she should be there.  And she was just a skeleton with skin hanging off her body.  Nice.  And it was the only time you'd ever heard anybody in Hollywood saying that she went from a healthy looking 133 pounds to a disturbing 79 pounds.  79 pounds she got down.  But when would they ever say anybody, her height was a healthy 133 pounds in Hollywood? 
[00:34:30]  She can't be what, more than 5'4", 5'4".  She looks little.  Yeah, 133, 5'4", is big, especially if you're trying to be an actress in Hollywood.  Plus the fact that the whole couple of first seasons, that was Kirk Cameron's whole thing of saying that his sister was fat.  Was fat, yeah.  Yeah, that was like the running joke.  So maybe that's why Kirk Cameron found God because he basically sent her into anorexia.  They never said why he went to Jesus? 
[00:35:00]  You know, I missed the beginning part of it, but maybe it was so he could deal with his fame.  Because I'll tell you something.  People don't just go to Jesus.  Thank you, everyone.  It's Julie McCullough.  Julie McCullough?  Yeah.  Oh, there it is.  And she was in Playboy, right.  Let's see.  Yeah.  And they had...  And the producers were trying to get their way around saying that she was a bad actress, like they wouldn't come right out and say it?  No.  She was inexperienced.  Yeah.  She couldn't handle, like, the storylines we were giving her.  Yeah, they had to come up with something.  But the fact is, they showed on the show last night that that storyline that she had with Kirk Cameron was getting ratings. 
[00:35:30]  And people were really, really into it.  And he turned around in the off-season and said, look, man, I'm a born-again.  And I can't be, you know, hanging out with a girl that posed naked in Playboy.  And Playboy went behind her back and took the pictures again.  We're talking in his fake life.  It wasn't even in his real life.  Like, he couldn't be seen in his fake life with someone that is playing, you know, the girl next door.  But she just happened in her real life to pose naked for Playboy. 
[00:36:00]  That's maybe a convenient way of finding Jesus.  You do it so your character finds Jesus and you still go out and drug it up and rail girls and stuff.  But your character found Jesus.  What a tool.  Wow, he wrecked it.  He reamed it.  Yeah.  Well, look what happened to his career.  Smart move, Kirk.  Yeah, and then what happened to that kid, Ben?  What do you mean?  I thought he came across pretty well.  Jeremy Miller.  Yeah, but he looked a little weird.  That's what Rick is saying. 
[00:36:30]  That's what I was saying.  He looked a little strange, didn't he?  I thought he's young still, though.  He's only like 24, 25.  Yeah, but it looks like he's actually gotten a little younger since the show.  Really?  Like his facial hair hasn't really developed.  Just kind of sticking straight out.  And alien-like.  And then I forgot Leonardo DiCaprio.  Yeah, he was in there.  No quotes from him, though.  Only at the time.  And he was involved in the last two seasons.  I forgot all about that.  And also, remember, the show was dying.  Yeah.  Remember that they had a baby?  Yeah.  And they had a whole season where she was pregnant and stuff and all the storylines, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:37:00]  And the show was dying.  And so, in the off-season, they just decided to make the baby a kid.  They aged the kid.  They aged the kid up to five or six, just like that.  They did that in a bunch of different shows, though.  What was the other one?  Family Guys.  Michael J. Fox.  Yeah.  Oh.  Family Guys.  That's right.  They aged the little kid.  Days of Our Lives, they did it, too.  That is the death knell of any TV show, when they bring in the new kid.  Bring in the new kid, right?  Oliver Syndrome.  It is the Oliver Syndrome, yes.  Oliver Syndrome.  From the Brady Bunch. 
[00:37:30]  What about Married with Children?  All of a sudden, seven shows up.  Oh, that was ridiculous.  And that spelt the end of that show.  Cosby Show, they brought in the new kid.  Oh, that little Raven Simone.  Ugh.  She ain't little no more.  What a mess.  Yeah, you see that big old ass?  She's getting a Dr. Doolittle.  She's in the Dr. Doolittle movie.  Dr. Doolittle.  And she's got that do big ass.  Last season of Partridge Family, too, they brought in that little dark-haired kid from next door.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Mikey or Mickey?  Ricky. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, that's right.  With the stupid hair, right?  Well, it was the hair of the time.  It was stupid.  Yeah, they brought him in to sing, oh, God, and he would sing that annoying song that you  would stick in your head for years.  Don't even try to think of it.  The radio was even playing it.  No, we'll find it.  Sooner or later, you find out for yourself, you can do it.  Why is that stuck in my head?  How the hell did you come up with that one?  Wow.  That's good, Ed.  I remember him singing something song about Willie Mays. 
[00:38:30]  About Willie Mays?  Willie Mays.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was about the end of that show, too.  The death of one of these sitcoms when they bring in the kid.  And how much surgery did Alan Thicke get?  Oh, he looks like a freaking Barbie doll.  I don't even know if he could close his eyes anymore.  He needs some work on his hair transplant, though.  There was that little spot where the hair was missing.  He used too much gel on his hair transplant and all gathered up in one spot.  Yeah, that was some fun TV last night.  So, it was great to watch other people's pain. 
[00:39:00]  I kind of got in a little trouble last night watching that, though, because I had to tell...  Did you start...  Did you get caught here?  Why were you spanking it?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Tracy Gold's emaciated body.  Was it the behind the...  E. True Hollywood behind-the-scenes spank?  A little known fact, I went to school with Kirk Cameron's wife, Geneseo.  Oh, yeah?  And she was a Clio in the Greek system up there.  Uh-huh.  And I had to tell Sandy last night.  I had to brag and tell her, yeah, one night I was really drunk and I made out with her.  I thought she'd find that to be pretty cool. 
[00:39:30]  With Kirk Cameron's wife?  But she didn't find it too cool at all.  I'm like, oh, uh, what?  You never made out with anyone that's on TV?  Oh, all right.  Sorry.  Sometimes I gotta just not, like, express what's in my head.  Yeah, you could keep a few things to yourself.  So, it's not a problem.  That didn't seem too bad.  I just made out with her.  That was it.  Well, maybe she was a good Christian girl back then, too.  No stinky pinky?  Chelsea Noble.  Her real name, Nancy Mueller.  Really? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  All right, thanks, Caroline.  Bye.  That was a really good show last night.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, uh, the story's even a little bit weirder because there's this guy in New Jersey.  His name was Robert Marshall.  He's on death row for killing his wife.  And Joanna Kern starred in a TV movie.  Started in a TV movie about it with Robert Yurick.  And the son of this Robert Marshall was, like, a technical advisor.  And that's who Tracy Gold actually married.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  So, her father-in-law is on death row. 
[00:40:30]  Wow.  Oh.  There's a little cry for help.  Thanks, Mike.  All right.  Bye.  What does Sam want?  Oh.  Sam.  Hi.  You're listening?  Yeah, while I was in the car.  You never listen.  I know.  I never do.  What's up?  Nothing.  But I didn't get mad.  It's just that every time you always tell that story, I cannot tell you how many times I've heard it.  So, I just have to, like, roll my eyes because how many times I'm going to hear the same story? 
[00:41:00]  Did you roll your eyes in the car when you heard it now?  Yes, I did.  That's why I had to call.  I'm like, please.  I forgot that I told you.  Oh, my God.  You forget every time.  That's true.  It's not that big of a deal.  It's true.  Every time I see her on TV, you know, I made out with her once.  It wasn't even that big of a deal.  It wasn't like a major all-out make-out session.  All right.  It's just...  All right.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  Bye.  I thought you were telling me for the first time.  I really did. 
[00:41:30]  Steve, what's up?  It was, uh, Say Hey Willie, won't you get one out here?  Come on.  Do you know any more of it?  Say Hey Willie.  I've been waiting all year.  I don't know.  It's all like that.  The Say Hey Willie song.  That was Ricky saying that one?  Yeah.  Little Ricky with the black hair, yeah.  Yeah.  I just remember the You Can Do It song.  That's funny.  All right, man. 
[00:42:00]  Thank you.  All right.  Bye.  Later.  You'll find out for yourself.  You can do it.  You can do it.  You can do it.  La, la, la, la, la.  La, la, la, la.  And then you would just go on and on and on.  And you'd want to punch him in the head.  Eric, what's up?  Run his head over with the projects family boss.  All right.  Hey, you remember Sam from Different Strokes?  They brought the little kid in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That redheaded kid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It seems to be the way to go. 
[00:42:30]  And then they started doing all the special episodes.  And they brought his mom in.  When Sam got touched by the kid toucher at the bicycle shop, I think it was.  Yeah, that was another show that suffered from me.  Well, we never saw the Gooch, though.  The Oliver Syndrome.  The Gooch.  The Gooch.  Thanks, Eric.  All right.  Bye.  Frank, what's going on?  Hello.  Ah, Frank, what's up?  Wow.  Hello.  You're on the radio.  What's up?  Yes.  I drove for a company.  And I drove Tracy Gold. 
[00:43:00]  And her husband was accused of killing his parents, but they couldn't prove it.  I think he lived in New Jersey, like Tom's River.  Uh-huh.  Wait, the husband?  And they never could prove it, because I think the caller before was wrong.  He said, like, Tracy Gold's husband's brother or something.  So the story goes that Tracy Gold's husband is accused of killing his parents, but they  never approved it?  Yeah, because they couldn't place him at the crime.  Because, like, my boss would give me all the story.  We drove Tony Danza. 
[00:43:30]  Uh-huh.  We drove, I drove Drew Carey, stiffed me, didn't give me anything.  Um, I, I wanted, I always wanted to write a book about it, but, you know, I drove off  the book, so.  All right.  You know.  Thank you, Frank.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Write a book.  I opened door.  He got in.  Sat down.  I drove.  Chapter two.  I opened door.  He got out.  I shut door.  I drove away.  I drove him to Manhattan.  Epilogue.  Rob, what's up? 
[00:44:00]  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Uh, Ben's best friend, his next door neighbor, was actually the one and only Stinky.  No way.  You guys remember that?  Seriously?  Yeah, his name was Stinky, and Mike's best friend was Boner.  Oh, yeah, Boner was his friend.  I remember Boner.  I don't remember Stinky.  Did he make him, did he make him change his friend's name when he was born again?  Yeah, I can't have a friend named Boner.  I'm born again Christian.  I've accepted Jesus Christ.  I can't hang out with Boner.  Hey, uh, really quick, if you don't mind, you guys.  Yeah.  Do you remember a couple of months ago, I actually, I called up and, uh, I had told 
[00:44:30]  you guys I was having phone sex with my girlfriend's best friend?  No.  No?  I don't remember.  Oh, well, anyway, we had a little discussion about it.  I got caught.  Oh, yeah?  You got caught?  Yeah.  How'd she catch you?  She picked up the phone.  I thought she was asleep, but then she wouldn't be heard.  Oh, I remember you.  Okay.  I call you guys all the time, but, you know.  You would have, uh, phone sex with your girlfriend's, uh, best, uh, best friend while, uh, your,  your girlfriend was sleeping upstairs, right?  Yes.  And she finally picked up the other end of the phone? 
[00:45:00]  Yes.  Uh-oh.  What'd she hear?  Uh, well, we were kind of in the middle of it, and, and to be honest with you, I mean,  I'm in trouble anyway, but the way I got out of it.  Yeah.  Um, because obviously if she knew it was her best friend, then I'd be in much bigger trouble  than I am now.  I just told her I was calling a pay service, and I was, you know, because I was drunk,  and I just had to get it out.  Well, I hope she doesn't listen to the O.P. and Anthony show.  I hope not right now.  All right.  Thank you.  Later, boys.  You guys suck.  Thank you, Rob. 
[00:45:30]  Now, this guy's saying that driver has the Tracy Gold story all wrong.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Fuel.  What's going on?  What's up?  Well, the way it is, it's Tracy Gold married Robert Marshall's son.  Robert Marshall is the guy who killed his wife on the parkway, the guy who lived in  Tom's River.  Okay.  They made that Blind Faith movie.  Okay.  That's it.  All right.  So she's married to, uh...  To his son.  All right.  Well, that's fine.  No big deal.  All right.  Thank you for clearing that up.  Later, guys.  Thank you.  No problem. 
[00:46:00]  Meredith Baxter-Bernie is effing hot?  Ugh!  Guys, hold on.  We'll go right to him.  Tom!  Hey, Tom!  Hey, Tom!  Shouldn't have went to him.  Tom!  I know.  Because I've seen her recently.  You know, she was kind of a little perky thing back in the day.  But now...  Ooh!  She's got that...  You know when they dig up a mummy in Egypt and expose the face and the lips are gone,  but the teeth is there?  She's got that look going for her now.  Which is nice. 
[00:46:30]  No.  It's the mummy now.  Arr!  Loretta.  Loretta.  Yes.  What's up?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  I just thought you guys would like to know that I saw David Cassidy at Westbury Music  Fair last Thursday.  Faggy?  Not faggy!  Why would we care about that?  Well, I don't know.  Anthony seems to get a kick out of things like that.  What was he doing?  He was doing a concert.  And did he do all of his Partridge Family songs?  Well, at first he did a lot of his Las Vegas stuff, because he's been in a lot of different  Las Vegas acts over the years. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, man.  We could get into this a little bit, because I hate when people do this.  If you're going to go see David Cassidy, you want to see him doing the stupid songs.  God loves you!  It was like what you said about Neil Young a couple weeks ago, how he didn't play any of  his stuff, and finally people were starting to get really antsy, and then he said, okay,  here comes the obligatory stuff that I've got to do.  Obligatory.  Gee, thanks for throwing us a bone, David Cassidy.  And apparently...  Wait, wait, wait.  These old stars have got to realize why people are coming to see them still.  It's not so they can try out their new stuff.  It's not so they can do their Vegas act. 
[00:47:30]  Freaking sing the Partridge Family tune.  That's what people go to see David Cassidy for, and should be gassed in the venue, by  the way.  Loretta.  Look, and I have to say, I saw Bobby Sherman two years ago.  That was even worse.  I'm finally reliving my childhood fantasies.  But he was actually pretty good.  He's 60 years old, David Cassidy.  Bobby Sherman?  Isn't he an ambulance driver now?  No, he's an EMT.  Yeah.  He was actually very good, though.  Oh, yeah?  But there were still girls running up to the stage throwing bras and underwear on the 
[00:48:00]  stage to David Cassidy.  And he didn't even really know what to do with them.  He felt stupid.  Did he do this on Loretta?  And right in the middle of a wet dream, and all at once I wake up.  Yes, he did.  Actually, then he went into the whole repertoire, which actually, he was very good.  Did everybody like When This Song Starts?  Oh, everyone was screaming.  Woo!  David!  Oh! 
[00:48:30]  Take your ball and take it off now.  He actually was very good.  He had a couple of backup singers.  You guys would have appreciated one of them.  She was a blonde bombshell, and she was doing a hot little number with him, and they were  like doing a dance on stage.  But he was actually very good.  And why would we appreciate that?  I don't know.  I just thought you would.  Oh, all right, all right.  All right.  You guys are great.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Shut up.  Ken, what's going on?  Hey, you know, similar story.  I was at the Montreux Jazz Festival a few years ago, and headlining was Ray Charles, but 
[00:49:00]  opening up for him was Van Morrison.  And similar story.  I mean, I don't know Van Morrison's catalog of work, but I do know that he did Moon Dance.  Moon Dance.  Everyone knows Moon Dance.  Van Morrison has some unbelievable songs that have never made the radio, by the way.  But go ahead.  That's a little side note.  So, dig this.  I mean, there's a full moon in the sky that night, but he didn't play the song.  You're there to see Moon Dance.  Yeah.  I mean, he went through everything. 
[00:49:30]  It's like, Van, look up.  The guy's a little crazy, you know.  He goes around, and he's like...  These guys, they've been around...  He's actually speaking through his, what do you call it, the harmonica, like saying  profane words.  Oh, man.  The guy used to party with Jim Morrison.  Figure it out.  He doesn't know where he is anymore.  But these guys, they've got to take care of their fans.  Yeah, they didn't take care of me.  I went away with a lot of...  I mean, saying about being fat and stuff like that.  Right.  All right. 
[00:50:00]  Thank you.  Anyway.  Bye.  Take it easy.  Let's go to John.  John, what's up?  Hey, John.  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, for the Bobby Sherman show, with those underwear, was it like bloomers or like Depends  being thrown up there now?  Big wet Depends.  Hits him in the face.  I don't think they're throwing thongs up there anymore.  No.  Wet diaper right to the face.  Hey, you guys suck.  All right.  Here's the guy that thinks she's hot, Meredith Baxter Burney.  Ah, Tom.  Yo.  What's up?  Hey, what's going on? 
[00:50:30]  Meredith Baxter...  Still talking about Kirk Cameron and those TV shows?  You say Meredith Baxter Burney is hot?  Absolutely.  Even now?  No, I haven't seen her ages.  Okay.  Yeah, I'll agree with you like years ago.  Back then, though, she was like the mom you wanted to get milk and cookies from.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  I'll agree with you on that.  Okay.  We're talking about today, though.  Remember the movie she did?  It was some breast cancer movie, and they actually showed her tease on the Lifetime channel?  Looked like she hadn't slept for years.  Lifetime was weird. 
[00:51:00]  You know, you never watched it because you're a guy, for the love of God, and occasionally  they would do those breast cancer shows or dramatization, the movies, and they'd show  the boob.  So you'd have to sit through this bad chick flick just to see Meredith Baxter Burney's  cans.  Yeah.  And now, a Lifetime exclusive motion picture starring Marky Post, as you've never seen her  before.  In a movie every Lifetime movie's about, she meets a guy. 
[00:51:30]  He's really terrific and wonderful.  They go out for a while.  Then he beats the living crap out of her, and she spends the rest of the movie getting  justice.  And unlike in real life, she gets justice, but only here on the Lifetime channel, starring  Marky Post, Joanna Kearns, and Meredith Baxter Burney.  In every movie on Lifetime, we just alternate them in different roles.  I had the parental block on Lifetime in my house.  And Robert Urich as the really bad guy. 
[00:52:00]  Or Ted Danson.  Ted Danson.  He was in a few of those.  Like any guy that's on a Lifetime channel movie is always a prick.  It starts out so great, too.  Hi.  I just met the most wonderful guy in the world.  Oh, you did guess.  We went out last night.  It was great.  He was perfect.  And now he's trying to get in my window with a huge knife.  Oh, Jesus.  There you go.  You abuse him, and then they get married, and you abuse her.  What does she do?  She kills him, and then has to go to court.  And she finally gets off at the end. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, thank God.  The story is true.  Hi.  I'm Marky Post.  The story you saw was true.  But if you want more information on...  Shut up!  Shut up!  Lifetime.  Hey, if they call it that, anything you watch there, it seems like it's taking a lifetime.  Brother Ham.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, man?  Hey, I just read your article in a FHM magazine. 
[00:53:00]  Pretty cool stuff.  Oh, you're calling from San Francisco, huh?  That's it, man.  Cool.  Brother Ham.  I saw that thing about Geddy Lee.  How cool was he in the studio?  Geddy Lee was so freaking cool on our show.  We can't even tell you.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  The guy was...  He's a regular guy, you know?  We thought it was going to be hard to bring him in and talk to him.  It's Geddy Lee, for God's sake.  And then we had things going on.  We had the big boob chick in here, right?  Yeah, I saw it on the net.  We barely talked about Rush and his solo project because we were just having so much  fun hanging. 
[00:53:30]  He was like one of the guys that day.  It was really cool.  He was down with you guys?  Without a doubt, man.  Right on.  Did you guys, after the show, what?  Twist a couple of fatties and burn with them or something?  No.  Nothing that crazy, but we had fun.  We loved to have him back.  All right.  Well, just so you guys know, I got a wow sticker on my car and just waiting for the San Francisco  females to flash me.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Thanks.  Thanks for helping us out in San Francisco.  All right, man.  All right.  Peace.  Sam Fran.  By the way, yes, Tony checking in.  Markie Post was indeed very hot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't seen her lately either.  A lot of those 80s sitcom chicks, you know, the cast of Golden Girls. 
[00:54:00]  Now, Markie Post was pretty hot, though.  Pam Dauber.  Pam Dauber.  Yeah.  I like the other one from my sister, Sam.  Oh, the dead one?  That got shot.  Rebecca.  The dead one.  Rebecca, blah, blah, blah.  They actually were, uh, they filmed right next to, uh, the other one.  Yeah, no.  Part of the Golden Girls.  There's Markie Post in the bikini.  When was this taken?  Because she doesn't look like a kid here, but if that's recently, she's holding up pretty  well.  I don't think that's recent. 
[00:54:30]  No?  No way.  She does have the 80s hair going.  Jesse, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Me and a bunch of my friends went to see, uh, Van Morrison.  Yeah.  In concert, right?  Uh, this guy is the biggest dick.  He doesn't play any of his radio songs.  He hates them all.  He won't play Moon Dance.  He won't play Brown Eyed Girl.  Nothing like that.  Bastard.  He plays the whole concert with his back to the audience.  Right?  He won't even look at him.  He's a dick.  And, and, and he wouldn't even interact with him.  You know how some bands, like, they'll start jamming and they'll just start talking about, 
[00:55:00]  like, I don't know, something that they did in the 12 bus.  They'll just talk to the audience.  Like, get a general response.  This guy wouldn't even look at us.  It's funny.  I, I saw Bob Dylan once and we'll never see him again.  Really?  Why would it happen with that?  Why would you go see Bob Dylan?  Oh, because the legend thing?  Or, I like some Bob Dylan songs.  Oh, Bob Dylan's a similar song.  And he's an icon of our, of our lifetime.  But I went and the guy didn't acknowledge the audience, looked down at the floor the whole  time, singing the songs to the point where they were unrecognizable.  Oh, yeah, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he's a translator now. 
[00:55:30]  Well, I like, I, you know, I don't mind going to see a band and they, they, they, you know,  they, they switch the tune around a little bit, jazz a little bit, whatever, make it a  little different.  It was the point.  You had no clue what song he was singing.  He had an all-star band with him, like, uh, Paul Schaefer and all these recognizable names.  Didn't introduce his band.  Didn't look at the audience.  Never acknowledged the audience.  Played for whatever it was, 45 minutes or so.  Did you jump up on the stage with that painted on you?  What was that guy?  Oh, uh, soy bomb. 
[00:56:00]  So it's soy bomb painted on you in protest, Opie?  And then, uh, his time was up.  He just leaves the stage.  You're, uh, you're assuming, you know, it's encore time because, you know, he still hasn't  really played anything very recognizable.  That was it, man.  Thanks for coming.  Yeah.  Van Morris, I mean, he started playing stuff from back when he was, when he was with them,  like the crazy Irish band.  Yeah.  I mean, it was good and everything, but we showed up $73 just to see this guy play some stuff  that we know.  See, when I was talking about Neil Young and the last time I saw him and how he decided  not to play anything recognizable, you know, if you want to do that and you want to charge 
[00:56:30]  your fans $10, I could see it.  But when you have to, you know, pay, uh, you know, $73, $100, I mean, that's kind of cheap  these days for, uh, some of these bands that have been around a while.  You're expecting to, you know, to see some hits.  Yeah.  Something I know.  Right.  Craziness.  You don't mind checking out a tune you don't really know that well, but you also want  Not at all.  You also want the songs that, uh, you know, you know and love.  Exactly. 
[00:57:00]  All right, Jesse.  All right, thanks.  You got stuck.  Bye.  Bye.  Nicole checking in.  Oh, come on.  The Nancy McKeon abused wife movie on Lifetime is awesome when the guy was stomping on her  head.  As every one of those movies is about.  The guy's really great.  The first 10 minutes of the movie, then he turns into a homicidal nut and she's got to  kill him or something.  Fantastic.  Oh, wow.  God, we're running late though.  All right, we'll go to Rich.  Rich, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:57:30]  What's up?  Here, guys.  Congratulations on your syndication.  Yeah, we're having fun with that.  Oh, no kidding, right?  Hey, boy, finally my brother gets to hear it, but do you remember the two TV shows?  There were movies.  One had the girl who died of like, uh, uh, uh, uh, diabetes where her baseball coach was  taking pictures of her.  Yes, that was, um.  It was a, you know, a pedophile thing.  Yeah, she was, uh, she was like, um.  Oh, God, I can't remember the name of the movie though.  Fallen Angel or.  Yeah, Fallen Angel.  I think it was something like that. 
[00:58:00]  And then the other one.  It was the guy from Risky Business.  Weren't they all called Fallen Angel?  Yeah, Fallen Angel.  Yeah, he was the, he was the interviewer.  Yeah, he was the interviewer from this college in Risky Business.  And then the other one.  How about the one with Ted Danson that was in it?  Something about Amelia.  Something about Amelia.  Ted Danson was, uh.  Oh, daddy.  Who's your daddy?  Yeah.  Ted Danson was, uh.  Incest?  Having some incest with his daughter.  Incest movie?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a good one too.  That's the originator of Who's Your Daddy?  Who's Your Daddy?  You, I tell you what, you raise a girl on Nothing But Lifetime, you will raise yourself a lesbian. 
[00:58:30]  And something embarrassing?  Man, she will hate men.  Something embarrassing?  Yeah.  I went to Barry Manilow.  I have to admit it.  You, you saw Barry Manilow where?  Uh, PNC with my ex-wife.  Wow.  Now ex-wife.  Did she drag you there?  Uh, pretty much so.  I had to cut short a family vacation for it.  That's a little rough.  Da-da-da.  Her name was Lola.  That's a little rough.  She was a showgirl. 
[00:59:00]  Oofa.  Ach.  Oofa.  Oofa.  All right.  Oh, my.  All right, Rich.  Later.  Bye.  Barry Manilow.  How pee-whipped are you if your wife or chick is taking you to Barry Manilow?  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm trying to think the worst concert I ever went to.  I'll tell you mine.  I know what mine was.  And it was a chick that dragged me to it.  Jackson Brown.  I had to go see Jackson Brown.  Did he at least, you know, hit a lady on stage or something? 
[00:59:30]  No, that would have been good.  Between songs?  He leaned over and punched his chick in the face.  Why don't you stay?  Oh, yeah.  That's wonderful.  Running on empty.  Running.  Shut up.  What about that show with the one-word name guy that you once saw?  What are you talking about?  Yanny.  Yanny.  Oofa went to go see Yanny.  For a break, right?  Anthony, we've got to take a break.  Was it in a castle with flames and stuff?  Did you see him in that atmosphere?  Anthony, we've got to take a break.  We'll be back with the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:00:00]  I don't know what you guys are talking about.  Hey, this is Garrett Morris, and you're listening to blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank, blank.  You know, O.P. and Anthony.  I say blank, blank, blank, blank, because you know they do a lot, blank, blank, blank, blank talking, you know.  Beaner to Leroy Brown.  All hail to the champs.  O.P. and Anthony.  1027.  WNEW.  Anthony, Planet Java.  Yes, when was the last time you, uh, trembled?  If you haven't lately, you don't know what you're missing,  because Planet Java's Tremble, Javadelic, and Karamoca are the best ways to keep cool this summer. 
[01:00:30]  They're iced coffee with an attitude.  Definitely the wildest thing to hit the streets in a long time.  Planet Java, they got the sampling trucks out there hitting the streets, too.  They're bringing three great flavors to your area.  Javadelic, it's smooth.  It's grown-up milkshake.  Perfect low-fat mix of milk and coffee.  Karamoca is chocolate caramel in a coffee.  It's a dessert.  It's a morning drink.  What the hell is it?  It's great.  Tremble.  There you go.  That's what everyone's talking about.  121 milligrams of caffeine all at once.  It's bam in a bottle, and yes, it is legal.  And now the latest talk is how great a mixer Planet Java makes. 
[01:01:00]  So go ahead.  Be creative.  Planet Java iced coffee available wherever Coca-Cola products are sold.  If your retailer doesn't have Planet Java yet, yell at them.  Say, hey, go get some Planet Java.  What's wrong with you?  Iced coffee just got cool.  Settle for nothing less.  We love it.  We drink it here.  It's Planet Java.  Obi and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:01:30]  This is the O&A Show.  Thanks for checking us out today.  We greatly appreciate it.  Let's go to Susie in Boston.  Susie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm just over with talking about how he hooked up with Nancy Mueller.  Well, it was a quick...  Or Chelsea Noble, rather.  It was a quick make-out session at the in-between in Geneseo when we went to school together.  I don't want to, like, make it a huge deal.  Oh, no, no.  She wasn't the girl that leaked on your pants, was it, Opie?  I was a Clio, too, in Geneseo. 
[01:02:00]  And part of our pledging was that we had to learn all about her.  Like, we had to know, like, she was Nancy Mueller, how long she was a Clio, just, like,  stuff like that.  But I never learned that too bit of information about her.  So I'm sure to call the girls and let them know some new information.  Susie, there were a few people that made out with Nancy in college.  I wasn't the only one.  I'm sure.  But you're probably one of the famous ones that they like to hear about.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But after she graduated the sorority, would you use that to get people to pledge your sorority? 
[01:02:30]  No, no.  I didn't know that until we started pledging.  They just, I don't know, it was silly, you know.  It was just another thing for them to yell at us about.  Right, right on.  You know, it was kind of a joke, but we still did have to learn it.  It was pretty funny, but that's about it.  All right, Susie, thank you.  Yeah, and I just wanted to say I'm glad to get you guys in Boston.  I moved here from New York a year ago, and I was missing you guys, so good to have you syndicated.  We're loving the fact that we're on in Boston again.  Yeah.  Right on.  Keep listening. 
[01:03:00]  We'll have a few surprises for you.  All right, good.  Cool.  We'll always have a few surprises for you up our sleeves.  All right, Susie.  Oh, this is hysterical.  Yeah.  A couple of people chiming in now about either TV shows or bands that are playing.  You go to see them, and they screw it up.  They don't play the hits.  One guy said, last night on Lifetime, Peter Strauss beaten by his wife, Judith Light, on a Lifetime exclusive, Men Don't Tell.  Men Don't Tell.  It was a riot watching him beat the crap out of him, and him just taking it. 
[01:03:30]  Peter Strauss beaten by Judith Light.  Judith Light beating the pee out of Peter Strauss.  Yes, they do have the best names for those Lifetime movies, though.  Men, Men Don't Tell.  Men Don't Tell.  You see him at work, Bob, what happened?  I walked into a door.  I'll never tell.  My secret pain and embarrassment.  My wife beats the crap out of me.  Is that a real problem you think out there?  Oh, come on.  It has to be if it's on Lifetime. 
[01:04:00]  Men Don't Tell.  Who?  What self-respecting guy is standing there as his chick punches him in the face?  And he's not telling or fighting back?  Men Don't Tell, O.P.  Men Don't Tell.  Judith Light beating me up.  Judith Light, a stick figure.  A friggin' stick figure.  And she's beating up Peter Strauss.  That's classic.  And then this guy, Pantera, checking and saying, I saw the coasters in a racetrack upstate New York.  Talk about sad.  They were all old black guys wearing these flashy suits, singing on stage. 
[01:04:30]  It was actually a trailer that folded out.  But the worst part is, when they did Charlie Brown.  Remember that?  Charlie Brown.  He's a clown.  And the guy who does the low pitch.  Why is everybody always picking on me?  Was so old, he totally couldn't do the line.  He just held the mic out to the crowd.  That was his only line.  Pathetic but hysterical to watch a bunch of old men trying to do the boy band dance moves.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:05:00]  I would bet a lot of money.  I bet you there's only one original member of the coasters.  Oh, yeah.  If that.  That's another thing happening.  These bands are turning into franchises now.  Beach Boys, they tour every summer.  Mike Love.  There's only one member left.  Leonard Skinner's down to one, maybe two original members.  They're still touring like crazy.  Fog Hat was like, we call them Fake Hat.  Fake Hat.  The lead guitarist when I saw him was 22 years old.  I'm like, what was he playing when he was in the womb?  But you go to see some of these bands and you think you're going to get a blast from the past. 
[01:05:30]  And you've got guys up there.  It's like, the bass play is 25.  Even worse, these bands that really think they could go on without the lead singer.  Yeah.  Thinking that people were really paying attention to the guitar riffs and stuff.  Journey.  No offense to Neil Sean and all, but I mean, you know, come on.  Journey without Steve Perry.  It's over, Johnny.  What band?  All these bands are on behind the music and they're all doing it without their singers. 
[01:06:00]  Sticks, right?  Sticks.  Sticks is doing it without that guy, Dennis DeYoung.  How do you do that?  Why do I know that?  Yeah.  Because it was on behind the music.  I want to know what happened to Dennis DeYoung.  Well, he's got that light thing, right?  In the 70s, he looked like a rock and roll, you know, god up there on stage.  And now he looks like he should be hanging with Elton John and Liberace.  Judith Light's been hitting him.  Men don't tell.  Men don't tell.  Men don't tell.  On Lifetime.  Pull up that thing again. 
[01:06:30]  Oh, some of the dopey Lifetime movies.  Delta Burke in Dangerous Child.  Starring Ellen Burstyn, Laura Dern.  And, of course, Mayor Winningham.  Hold on.  There's a bunch of...  Mayor Winningham!  There's a bunch of Lifetime movies coming in now.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  It must have been like lesbian programming night last night.  Because they had the guy getting beat up by Judith Light.  And then they had the chick from Charlie's Angels burning her husband up in the bed.  In the burning bed.  The burning bed.  Farrah Fawcett, right?  Farrah Fawcett, right.  That's her name. 
[01:07:00]  I was like, Jesus, what are they doing tonight?  You know, it was crazy, you know?  Farrah Fawcett.  You know, my fiancé's laying in the bed next to me like, oh, my God.  Look at that.  I was like, yeah, turn to the channel.  Turn to the channel.  I don't want you to get any ideas.  You know what I'm saying?  It's crazy.  I'm right on.  All right, Tony.  Take it easy, guys.  It's crazy.  Trader Jack.  Trader Jack.  What's up, man?  Hey, what's up, boys?  How you been?  Good.  Good.  Hey, you know what?  Dickie Betts and Jackson Brown did the soundtrack for Men Don't Tell.  Very good.  All right.  Have a good one, guys. 
[01:07:30]  Keep it real.  Bye.  What's Sean got up there on line one?  Where am I going, Sean?  Is that another Lifetime movie title?  Sean.  Hey, guys.  What's up, man?  A couple of years ago, there was a movie with Melissa Gilbert.  It was called Mother, May I Sleep With Danger.  Mother, May I Sleep With Danger.  Starring Melissa Gilbert.  It's absurd.  Totally absurd.  You guys suck.  You can't even get through the credits of these movies if you're a guy with any set of balls on you.  I swear to God, I used to be subject to some of these movies.  Not anymore, but when I was married, I used to be subject to some of these goddamn movies. 
[01:08:00]  And I would sit there, and the second they came on, I would go, oh, here it comes.  Oh.  Well, Stephen Collins in a very special movie starring Mare Winningham.  And Patty Duke.  And Ellen Burstyn.  Yes, Patty Duke.  Patty Duke was another one that was in.  Patty Duke Astor.  On every Lifetime movie.  In a very special movie of another bitch that wasn't listening.  Like you've never seen her before. 
[01:08:30]  I used that one a lot.  In Bitch, I Told You Three Times to Shut the F Up.  A Lifetime exclusive.  And any guy that ends up on Lifetime, career over.  Over.  Your career's over, so you go to Lifetime.  Not this guy.  Stephen Collins, he'd done like ten of these movies, and now he's on that show Seventh Heaven.  Like I said, over.  He's still making sense.  He's watching the show for him.  But the funniest part is, this guy, in every movie he was in, he was like the lawyer, doctor, 
[01:09:00]  husband, who 20 minutes in is driving his brand new Corvette with his hot little babe down  the driveway.  I think he was the one that hooked up with the babysitter in one of those movies.  That's one that I saw.  He has a wife, the kids, the family.  Everything's perfect.  It's always perfect at the beginning of it.  And then before you know it, he's tooling the babysitter in his car.  And then she wants to rat.  But that sounds hot.  So now, yeah, yeah, she was pretty hot.  That one I would check out.  Then the babysitter wants to rat out to the wife. 
[01:09:30]  Now what does the guy have to do?  You've got to kill the bitch.  Take both of them out.  You beat the wife with the babysitter.  It was Felicity.  The chick who plays Felicity.  That was the girl.  That was the babysitter.  He was male and her.  Yeah.  Right on.  Let's go to Bob.  We're all over the ball field today.  Bob.  Why not?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Call from Connecticut.  I just wanted to throw another band at you that's hanging on.  Yeah.  Rat.  There's two versions of rat right now.  There's two versions.  There's rat with Stephen Piercy and nobody I've ever heard of.  And then there's rat that's been around that just kicked him out about a year ago. 
[01:10:00]  That's funny.  When the bands don't get along and they break up.  But none of them wants to give the name up.  So there's two rats.  But you've got to go with the Stephen Piercy rat, right?  Yeah, but he was just barely singing the last time I saw him.  I don't know how he's still doing.  Yeah, but at least he's the lead singer.  Warren, yeah, but I'm a guitar player.  Warren D. Martini to me was rat, so.  Wow.  Steve C., you're the metalhead.  You know about this.  Yeah, I grew up.  I'm in my 30s. 
[01:10:30]  Hold on, Bob.  Bob, hold on.  Hold on, Bob.  We're talking to Steve C. from Foundry Music.  Yeah, they were both touring.  Piercy's version of rat and Blotzer's and D. Martini's version of rat were both touring.  Playing the same tunes and everything.  Basically the same tunes.  Round and round.  Because overseas, there's still markets for this stuff.  Japan and Australia and Europe.  They can still pack them into like 5,000 seaters.  You know what you do then?  You get the five guys from a band.  You each go your own way. 
[01:11:00]  Get five bands.  Go all over the world.  Pull your money.  Hey, you're doing all right.  Why not?  Franchise.  Five times the band.  Franchise the band.  I'm from the school.  Simple as this.  Lead singer out of the band.  Band over.  Band gone.  Well, you know, Van Halen went on to quite a successful career with Sammy Hagar.  But you know that.  Yeah, but how many bands can say that?  It rarely happens.  There's always an exception.  Name me one more band.  Another band that was very successful with a second singer.  With a different singer.  I don't think you can come up with it. 
[01:11:30]  Rainbow.  Rainbow.  Genesis did it a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They weren't really huge until they had Black Sabbath.  I don't know.  Black Sabbath.  That whole Lamb Lies Down thing that Gabriel had going on was pretty good.  Black Sabbath?  Yeah.  I mean, not major hits, but...  It just doesn't happen that often.  Yeah, that's true.  Well, Journey just brought in a new guy.  I mean, they're not really doing as much as they were 10 years ago. 
[01:12:00]  It's not like they wouldn't even be doing well with Steve Perry.  No, they wouldn't be.  They wouldn't be.  The only reason they're doing okay out there is because supposedly the guy sounds just like  Steve Perry.  He does.  It's not like they're going to be putting out brand new songs and radio is going to pick  up on it.  Ben?  No, they...  ACDC.  Oh, there you go.  Wow.  Ben, coming through with a good one.  Well, I hope school rock, though.  No new bands can do it.  Yeah, that's true.  I think any bands you hit in the 80s and stuff might have a hard time doing it.  There aren't too many career bands left.  That's the problem. 
[01:12:30]  They're in for five years and then they're gone.  There's no more Aerosmiths.  There's no more Van Halens.  There's no more Rushes.  They're just...  Yeah, because those guys are still touring, man.  Well, I mean, but, you know, there's no bands from the 80s that have managed to successfully  tour with the exception of Poison, but they put three other guys, three other hair bands  on the bill and then they can...  Yeah, they got to load up those bills and hair bands just to get the...  Because remember my Aerosmith Warren story?  When the guy, the drums from Warren's doing his big drum solo, he throws his sticks out  into the crowd.  This crowd was so sparse, you heard the sticks go, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, clink, 
[01:13:00]  on the empty floor.  He threw it past the people.  He missed the crowd.  Yes, Ben.  What about Floyd with Gilmore?  That's another one on his feet back.  Yeah, that was always a good battle.  Pink Floyd.  There were two versions of that going on for a while.  All right, Bob.  All right, thanks, Ben.  Thank you.  See you.  This guy saw the husband-beater movie.  Men don't...  Husband-beater.  Oh, that one.  But we've all heard the term wife-beater. 
[01:13:30]  I've never heard husband-beater.  You saw it, Dan?  Dan.  Yeah, what's up, Bob?  Hey.  Uh, no, I was watching on, uh, like, Oprah or something, and it actually happened.  Like, this guy was getting beat by his wife and stuff, and he actually had to tape it  because the police wouldn't believe that his wife was beating him.  Oh, pussy.  How do you let your wife beat you up?  You know, you could sit there and let her, uh, yell at you and stuff.  Sure, that's fine.  That's acceptable.  It's called being married.  But not only did this guy have to tape it, he showed it on national television, all these  people.  Like, I'm getting beat up by my wife. 
[01:14:00]  They didn't have him behind the screen with the fake voice?  I've been being beaten for now.  It's been about nine years, Oprah.  No?  No, he's just telling her about it.  It's so funny, dude.  With the fake hair and the sunglasses.  By the way, right now, airing on Lifetime, This Child is Mine, starring Lindsay Wagner,  Nancy McKeon, and Michelle Lerner, or Michael Lerner.  This Child is Mine.  See, would you even stop on that if you were going through the channels? 
[01:14:30]  You know, but after this discussion, I'm going to have to check out from time to time  what stupid movies on Lifetime.  You will have to just punch in, but you can't stay there.  No.  You feel yourself growing breasts, and you feel your testes shriveling up to mere raisins  just sitting there watching it in the light.  Dean.  Yo, what's up?  Hey.  Another Lifetime movie.  Yeah.  On Her Own with Meredith Baxter Burney and Barry Bostwick.  Barry Bostwick and Meredith Baxter Burney.  And what's this movie about?  Oh, you know, the wife who has the husband who's cheating with the secretary, and she has 
[01:15:00]  to read the kids on her own.  I don't know what's going on.  We can change that in the world.  Yeah, you got it.  Remember the first, really the first Lifetime style movie that came out?  I think it might have even been before Lifetime was a network.  First, you cry.  It was the husband's response to his wife getting breast cancer.  First, you cry.  And it was the guy like, oh, no.  Oh, no. 
[01:15:30]  Please do.  First, you cry.  A Lifetime exclusive.  What's up?  Michelle.  Hey, Michelle.  Hey.  What's up?  Nothing.  I was calling to tell you guys are talking about Lifetime movies.  My husband, too, does cringe when the credits come on.  Yeah.  But he ends up staying in the room sometimes.  But there was an ultimate movie on yesterday.  It was Angelian and the girl from Growing Pains you guys were talking about.  Tracy Gold.  Yeah, and it was Angelian playing her mother.  And, like, her daughter, Tracy Gold, was born, like, with a defect. 
[01:16:00]  She was born without a uterus.  And Angelian ended up being a surrogate for her daughter.  Uh-oh.  That spelled trouble.  When Angelian then wants to keep the baby.  No, no.  Oh, damn.  That's what I wrote.  What a written in.  She ended up having twins.  Ah, look at that.  So they both got one?  No, no, no.  They ended up with just, like, her holding the two babies or something.  But Tracy Gold, they actually did a Lifetime movie about her in her own, like, her own life story kind of thing. 
[01:16:30]  She plays herself in her own life story.  Isn't that great?  All right.  Thank you, Michelle.  Thanks.  This phone's a little distracting, so let's move on to Jimmy.  Jimmy.  What's up, Jimmy?  What's happening, guys?  What's up, man?  You're going to laugh at this one.  I thought it was Doogie Howser, but it was a Lifetime movie.  It was called I Know My Name is Steven.  With that jerk from Parker Lewis.  Yeah, yeah.  Right?  And he gets kidnapped by this kid touching with Coke bottle glasses. 
[01:17:00]  There's one scene they show him in, like, the tight white drawers.  He's all huddled in the corner.  Finally, he, like, escapes.  He runs up, like, the dirt road.  Gets saved by, like, the milk man.  I know my name.  Yeah, yeah.  I know my name is Steven.  That's Corey Nemec.  Oh, hold on.  Parker Lewis.  That's what I am.  He ain't nobody.  Thanks, man.  All right.  We got to cut stuff developing here.  We have to go to Matt.  Matt, what's up?  Hold on.  Matt, what happened?  All right, hold on.  Find out what happened, Ben.  We're working on something.  Just be patient. 
[01:17:30]  I know my name is Steven.  I remember that.  I know my name is Steven.  He got kidnapped, and they changed his name.  Yeah.  Was it Corey Nemec?  That was based on a true story.  Based on a true story.  They all are.  Oh, my God.  They all rule when they're based on a true story.  Let me go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I don't know if that guy saw the same thing I did, but it was on 2020.  It was about, they covered like, I think it was about an hour-long show on guys that 
[01:18:00]  were getting the snot beat out of them by their women.  And they had this one guy, I'll never forget, they were handling it all seriously.  It was an epidemic or something.  It was a comedy to make.  Of course.  A guy sitting at a kitchen table.  His wife is just screaming at him.  He had the thing taped, and the wife is screaming at him at the top of her lungs and smacking  him in the back of the head, takes his plate with food on it, throws it across the room,  starts yelling at him, calling him names, and you know, bleep, bleep, bleep. 
[01:18:30]  And it's the funniest thing I've ever seen.  Meanwhile, the guy's just cowling.  He's got his hands over his head, and his head on the table.  Oh, it's hysterical.  That's great.  I mean, if you could ever get your hands on that, it's one of the funniest comedy routines  I've ever seen.  Cool.  Thank you.  God, that is the worst possible thing to have happen to you.  Mick, what's up?  What's up, bro?  Hey, what about Scott Baio and the truth about Alex?  The truth about Alex, the gay one, yeah.  He's like, I'm gay, but he's in the room with him. 
[01:19:00]  Was Scott Baio the gay guy, or was his friend gay?  Yeah, no, Scott, no, his friend was, but remember, he liked Scott Baio.  Yeah, Scott Baio's friend was gay, and Scott Baio had a hard time dealing with it.  Yeah.  And he was on the football team or something, they were in the locker room.  Yeah, and he didn't know whether to keep him as a friend or go to the friend, you know,  if his other friends were going to find out about it.  Those movies are, I think that was an after-school special.  Which was a teen version of Lifetime.  They ran 100 times on Lifetime after that.  All right, cool.  I always like when they do the after-school special, and at the end, they bring out the 
[01:19:30]  real person to talk about it.  Yeah, right?  They really look heinous sometimes.  Mick, thank you.  Later, guys.  Bye.  I know.  There's a million of them, but we do have to take a quick break.  Rosa, coming up on Lifetime, my stepson, my lover.  There you go.  That's a good one.  Or is that on Jerry Springer?  That's what we should do.  It could be a cool bit.  What?  We'll give it title, and we have to figure out if it's a Springer Lifetime movie or...  Yeah, we've got to figure out if it's a Jerry Springer, you know, title of one of his shows 
[01:20:00]  or a movie on Lifetime.  We've got to throw a third one in, too.  A news tease.  Or if it's a news tease.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes?  We have a concert announcement.  Concert announcement.  On Lifetime.  For all the fine folks in the Philadelphia area.  Yeah.  That includes us here in New York as well, I do believe.  Tool.  Tool coming to town.  The First Union Center.

And we're back with the O&A show.  Chris Cornell joining Rage Against the Machine.  He's not angry enough.  He sounds great, you know.  He's got a great voice, but he doesn't have that, you know. 
[01:22:30]  I can't picture him cruising down Rodeo, you know, with a shotgun.  If Chris Cornell is joining Rage Against the Machine, they should just come up with a new band.  Yeah.  Like, Zach seemed totally into it.  Like, I could picture him just, you know, driving down Rodeo, shooting people with a shotgun as he goes to his mansion.  Right.  In Beverly Hills, sure.  Maybe that washed at the beginning when they first got Rage together. 
[01:23:00]  But then, you know, he's making millions of dollars in the country that he hates and sings about how much he hates it.  And the system.  The system's doing all right by him.  The system did him okay, so I guess he stopped sounding as angry.  A mansion with a gate.  It's well protected.  Carrie, what's going on?  Hey, I wanted to tell you guys about my really bad concert experience with Greg Brady.  Greg Brady? 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams, doesn't he hang out with you guys?  Come on, Ope, you like Barry.  I like Barry Williams.  I wouldn't go see him, you know, perform, though.  Did he do, was he Johnny Bravo or Greg Brady?  Well, he was a combo.  It was in Lancaster, Pennsylvania last summer.  And ready to rock!  We have, I'm the real Greg Brady.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you have Good Day Sunshine.  What did he do?  Oh, the Good Day Sunshine, Sunshine Day medley. 
[01:24:00]  But why was it a bad experience?  Well, you know what?  I felt so bad for the man.  Here he is, 43, 44 years old.  He's up on stage with a karaoke machine.  He's waving to the crowd, blowing kisses.  It's like, who are you waving to?  Who are you blowing these kisses to?  I think he knows it's kind of tongue-in-cheek.  Hey, a nigga's got to eat.  You know, it was sad.  It was sad.  It was really sad.  I felt bad for him.  Hey, worse for him then or when he got caught for smoking when it wasn't really his cigarettes? 
[01:24:30]  I tend to say it's worse for him.  I don't know, I don't know.  He brought the wrong jacket home from school, Anthony.  It was the other guy from the band.  And thank God Alice realized that she had sewn up the lining in Greg's jacket.  And then that bitch of a mother had apologized to Greg and Mrs. Brady and the rest of the gang.  Yeah, the mother of the kid that really had the cigarettes.  All of a sudden, she's all on her high horse right there in the Brady household saying things like, 
[01:25:00]  you know, you have to identify there is a problem, Mrs. Brady.  That's right.  That's right.  And her son was the smoker.  He was the one smoking.  That's right.  And he wanted to hang Greg out to a drive.  And how believable was it that that lady was the mom of the kids?  She looked like she was 55.  Oh, I know.  A thousand years old.  She looked older than Alice.  There's the hot Mrs. Brady, you know.  And then that old bag was the other kid's mom.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Got a little carried away.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, Carrie.  Hey, guys, guys, before you go.  Yeah.  Can I tell you something? 
[01:25:30]  I love you guys so much.  I live in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.  Yeah.  I paid a hundred bucks for somebody to come into my house and install a special antenna  so I can pick you guys up out of Philly.  Hey, that's nice.  Really?  Yeah, honest.  And I have a favor to ask.  If I come into the city on Thursday, can I come up to the studio?  Oh, no.  I'm hot.  Do you want to do this, Sophie?  No, come on.  It's a new city.  I know.  No, we've got to be nice.  We're not going to be here Thursday. 
[01:26:00]  But you are.  No, really.  That's what the joke would have been to say yes and you'd have come down here.  There would have been a tape rolling.  We're feeling nice today.  You're not going to be there Thursday?  Where are you going to be?  It's almost vacation time for the show.  We're going to be suspended.  Yeah, we're going to do a fake suspension so everyone thinks we got fired.  Yeah.  And then they'll be listening when we get back and go, oh, wow, thank God you survived  your suspension.  Well, how about Wednesday?  Come on by. 
[01:26:30]  I can on Wednesday?  We'll be here Wednesday.  Come by Wednesday.  And you'll definitely let me up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Inside with you guys?  Yeah.  I can hang out.  As long as you get naked.  And you're not annoying.  I promise I won't be annoying.  Well, you get naked.  Okay.  All right, cool.  So I can hang out with you guys?  Duh.  Okay.  All right, bye.  See ya.  There she goes.  Look at that.  A hundred dollar antenna just to listen to us.  Bluto.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Bluto.  Hello. 
[01:27:00]  Hello?  Bluto.  Bluto.  Bluto.  That was when it's time to change.  Yeah.  All right.  Look at all the songs.  Which one do you want?  None.  Bluto, you guys suck.  All right, Bluto.  We have Barry.  I kind of had a hankering for Sunshine Day.  We have Barry Williams.  Yeah.  When he was singing I'm the real Greg Brady.  Yes.  He did it live on our show.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg, Greg, Greg. 
[01:27:30]  May I have your attention, please?  Marsha, Marsha, Marsha.  I repeat.  May I have your attention, please?  Will the real Greg Brady please stand up?  That's me, of course.  Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Uh-oh.  We're going to have a problem here.  Y'all act like you've never seen a real Brady before.  Belt bottles, polyester, headbands, orange hair.  Was it permed?  Was it real?  Hey, who cares?  Here's the story.  Here's the story.  Quiet.  A guy named me.  Greg Brady.  Barry Williams.  Don't you know we were the real that 70s show?  And old Alice O prepared Sam's meat for free. 
[01:28:00]  You know what I mean.  It's the return of Johnny Bravo.  Shut up.  Wait.  He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?  And Mike Brady said, nothing, you idiots.  Like Tiger, he's dead.  Shut up.  Greg Brady.  I'm sick of him, looking at him, walking around, wearing his tiki guide, surfing and wiping  out.  Yeah, but he's so cute, though.  He was cool for a while, being a teenage star, but now the Brady name can only go so far.  I'm doing stuff that's new, but I'm Greg Brady, too.  Football in the Martians, no, sing the chorus, and it goes. 
[01:28:30]  I'm Greg Brady, it's I'm the real Brady.  All the other Greg Bradys are just irritating.  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up, please shut up, please shut up.  Because I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than anything.  Brady, so stop your imitating.  Yes, I'm the real Greg Brady.  I grew up.  Shut up, Demi.  I grew up.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up.  Shut up, Demi.  It was so much fun.  Make that show for you.  Didn't write my book, too.  Telling you who's dating who.  Shut up.  All TV wasn't real.  Just play.  Back then you couldn't say that the dad was really gay or that my mom on TV was dating me.  TV? 
[01:29:00]  It was groovy.  Far out.  Out of sight.  But any night you light up a TV and then you see some wannabe trying to be me.  Greg.  Just be sure you know there ain't no show without me.  Barry Williams, Johnny Bravo.  Greg Brady.  The Casanova.  Greg Brady.  Of Clinton Avenue.  Greg Brady.  I got AKAs coming out the wazoo.  I dig Eminem and Clark bars, too.  I was the oldest kid and I was young and cute.  I would never do toot and I still fit that suit.  I'm here to stay and if you get in my way, you can cram it where there ain't no sunshine day.  I'm Greg Brady, it's I'm the real Brady.  All the other Greg Bradys are not syndicated. 
[01:29:30]  So if you ain't Greg Brady, please shut up, please shut up, please shut up.  Cause I'm Greg Brady and I did ladies more than any big Brady.  I was slim and shady.  Cause I ain't Greg Brady, please shut up.  Don't suck up.  Please throw up.  I've gotta get out of this time warp.  And how did I get stuck in this box in the upper right hand corner or anything?  I was a kid at Rock with Kid Rock and it was just a kid.  And Uncle Cracker was somebody's nephew.  I was like, I gotta go cause something suddenly came up with me. 
[01:30:00]  How would you like the more, huh?  Be quiet, sir.  That wasn't bad considering he did it live on the show.  He was rapping.  He was rapping.  Rapping Greg.  Anthony, Tim from Philly.  Hey guys, just so you know, Cornell isn't joining Rage.  They are starting a new band, new name, new tunes.  They won't do any Rage material.  I work in the music biz and am friends with Rage's management.  Thought you would like to know.  There you go.  There's an update on that.  That just in. 
[01:30:30]  Well, there were rumors flying that, you know, that that was going to happen, right?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Go, go.  Hey.  Hello, hello.  I'm going to be back.  Hello.  What's going on?  Don't curse.  What's up?  Hey, we're going, we're running in right now.  All right, go ahead, dude.  We're on the attack.  Who is, who's this?  What?  It's Tim.  Hey, Tim, what's up?  We're running in right now.  You sure it's all ready to go?  Well, we'll see. 
[01:31:00]  Hopefully he's inside.  Don't curse.  A lot of O&A.  No.  Just that.  Out.  He's hiding.  He's hiding?  Yeah.  Hey, guys, I've been chasing him all the time.  Can't get on Mike?  Yeah, go right now.  It's going right now.  Hold on.  Go, go, go.  Go, go, go, go.  Go, go.  Go, go.  Go, go. 
[01:31:30]  Go, go.  Go, go, go.  Go, go, go.  Go, go, go.  Oh, creator.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Am I going to grab something?  What are you going to grab something?

[02:08:00]  i think it makes for some good radio it's fun our old station doing a stupid blood drive playing the  same old music over and over again the guy you know he he's not even cool enough to like hang with  the listeners he's in the truck waiting for his break to start then he comes out remember when we used  to do the uh remotes and then we had an all-out attack as he's live in the air and then all you  hear is them going oh shut it off here they come and then dead air for 30 seconds because the guy back  at the station has to cue up a led zeppelin record and you don't think that's cool and and fun to listen 
[02:08:30]  to the best part i i listened to the tape of what it sounded like um if you had been listening to their  station funny man they just one of them was just going uh i guess maddie or whoever it is just going  all right uh shut it off turn it off and rock is just hey hey that's how you fight back shut it  off turn it off so they shut it off but they shut they just put their mics down i guess they assumed  that back at the home base they were gonna cut uh to a song but they didn't have they left everything

[02:11:00]  to get a little worried yeah that's all oh yeah we'll say no more about that right now yeah just  good reason to maybe be a little hey anthony a lot of people getting bit by sharks  in florida yeah you know something i'm going on vacation in florida i'm going to florida it's all the  god damn animal rights activists once again we gotta save the shark man the shark will save itself 
[02:11:30]  did a great job it doesn't matter how many chinese boats shoot harpoons into these things they'll they'll  breed and do just fine now all that's catching up to us and these animals are eating us they're eating  people not only that the alligators too did you hear that one 14 year old girl in orlando because  they're in a lake you know like a lake you're in a lake on little boogie boards with five of her  little playmates they call them they're little friends opie all of a sudden an alligator about a 
[02:12:00]  six footer grabs her arm and guys into a death row starts spinning the girls like uh said later i just  remember spinning and spinning and going oh my god this is how i'm going to die a 14 year old girl  and you know what our little playmates did paddled back to the beach as fast as their little  feet they didn't try to help her or nothing one girl stayed who the hell is helping anyone that's 
[02:12:30]  getting attacked by now especially when you're a kid like that it sucks to be you is what i'm thinking  it does so you know what happened one of them stayed one friend stayed and they're trying to paint  her as the hero she did nothing she probably just froze but she stayed there to watch when the  alligator let her go she grabbed onto her and paddled her back to shore but you know what the creepy part  is she was saying as i'm paddling i just was waiting for the alligator to grab my foot you know those  murky lake waters and you're flapping your feet you're like there's monsters under here so uh they had 
[02:13:00]  to do all kinds of surgery on our arm and now sharks bit like six surfers down in florida six  and it's all yeah save the shark man we got to save the shark shark's doing just fine the best  story coming out of florida um a guy is in his room wakes up because there's an alligator in his  room in his room turns out the alligator went through that little doggy door door  swear to god that's great save the alligator man no make bags and shoes out of them again 
[02:13:30]  crystal remember that on bugs bunny when they used to shoot the alligator with the shotgun  and he'd fly into smoke and then the smoke would clear and there'd be a handbag and boots  and a wallet sitting there and luggage that's what you gotta do where's that gun hey crystal hey hey  what's that nothing i just wanted to say it's my first time listening to you guys but you guys are  hilarious you guys are great oh you like us yeah i love that we're like oh it doesn't say that's what  you want to talk about on the air oh really oh but thank you yeah no doubt we appreciate it all 
[02:14:00]  right bye-bye all right bye-bye some of our new friends in the virginia area anthony uh bye-bye you  know it's funny when i bring up that whole thing about uh the kids paddling away when our little  playmate was being eaten huh um that's what kids do and we had mentioned this a while back remember uh uh  my friend uh randy told that story a bunch of kids were hanging out and they used to shoot an arrow bow and  arrow they'd shoot it up in the air and then you'd have to watch it because if you lose sight of it you 
[02:14:30]  don't know where it's coming down and it used to be like whoa everyone would just scatter  there's friends shooting arrows up in the air and they shoot one at a little bit too much of an  angle and they watch it go up come down there's a woman across the street on her knees gardening  you're just out in the sun enjoying your little garden so you're you're kneeling down the arrow goes  right through her camera and i just flock and i i mentioned it because what are you what did they 
[02:15:00]  do ran away you run you run from that situation you have to run in that situation same thing with me  my brother we uh when we were a little kid like i was in kindergarten and my brother's like a year  and a half older than me started a fire you know you're playing with matches you start a fire what do  you do run away you run you shut your door and you hope that it wasn't really happening you hear  the sirens you know you hear everything happening you're thinking to yourself maybe it's not that bad  you just pop on the tv maybe it's not that bad and you look out the window and all you see is flames 
[02:15:30]  and thick smoke see a neighbor with the gardening hose you're driving up a fire on the side of the house  we did uh knock on one of the doors after we saw it was really bad and said um to one of the  people right across from the fire excuse me do you have a hose and the person horror in their eyes  i looked into their eyes and as a kid i even remember i still remember this the reflection of  the flames in the the person's eye as they open the door it's like a nightmare do you have a hose i'm 
[02:16:00]  in kindergarten my brother is a year and a half older than me do you have a hose yeah no we're we're  top firefighters and uh we'll be battling this place no need to call the real fire department  we're fine we're the top fire department it's like you had the mini archies trying to get out  of fire don't worry no we arrived on our fire truck which is powered by a a dog chasing a cat in a cage  under the hood just like the little rascals yeah we got people out of the way with a big boxing glove 
[02:16:30]  on an accordion thing we punched them you should have seen they flew up in the air and their hat came  off so what's fantastic so what happened when they what happened when you told them this then you  needed the hose they just went oh my god and ran to the phone they didn't want us putting out the  fire they called the real fire department i was horrified like all right just try to help i was  trying to hey you got a hose i think we can deal with this well if you're going to have an attitude  about it you could take care of the damn fire yourself last time we put out a fire right 
[02:17:00]  i started it i felt we should put it out tom hey what's going on guys no big deal it's a blaze hey  hey i got a theory why the sharks are going after the people yeah they push the commercial fishermen  an extra mile offshore so all the the fish that they were catching within the half a mile of the  seashore yeah now they have to go out a mile and a half and all the fish have come in because  there's no pressure except the sharks follow them and once the fish are gone that's when they start  eating people that's good i think it's a combination of things like that um the fine people of green 
[02:17:30]  peace i'd love to see and wear and wearing silver bathing suits so you look like bait fish hey i i love  shark attacks hey guys all right love shark attacks fun to fun to watch on the news  have fun shark boy come on that's entertainment shark boy's fun when it's shark boy i don't want to  come back as shark guy shark guy shark anthony they are so anthony how was the vacation audience and 
[02:18:00]  the odds are slim and you're not gonna i've been by a sock and lost all my blood  you're not gonna be on a surfboard so you're not gonna look like a seal you think that kid you think  shark boy was on a surfboard shark boy was hanging out waiting in water that the surfers yeah they were  they were surfing what about that other guy that guy in the bahamas him and his wife just hanging  out taking a little swim what happens snorkeling snorkeling tom hey you know we forgot to talk about  a story last week you are bad rick yeah speaking of uh a lot of goofy stories in the news anyone else 
[02:18:30]  hear about the guy who drowned in his cat bowl yeah did we have the story last week yeah he was uh  what do you want to call it he's deaf in one ear so his balance was all off what do you do in your  play gas life that that's how you had to die in this one wasn't it um somewhere where like it's  winter because he fell on the ice or something no it was in his house it was new zealand where it's  like he slipped on an ice cube no no that's what i read now it's turning into an urban legend it's 
[02:19:00]  a real story that's what i read we have the story i heard he was outside it was slippery yeah and he  fell and did you read it or did you hear it because i read something where he hit his head on a  counter yeah fell into the cat bowl it was like an inch and a half high think about it if it was  icy outside the cat bowl would have been frozen over and he just would have smashed his stupid face  into the ice um i think he slipped on an ice cube from in the house it had landed on the floor perhaps  he was getting a beverage uh he hit his head on a counter fell forward into the little cat bowl of 
[02:19:30]  water sorry i'm laughing okay it is a dopey way to go man and he there uh died you gotta hang out  inhaling cat water you gotta hang out in heaven with people that died in a in a cool matter yeah fiery  crash whatever or you died because you fell into a cat had you died i fell into a cat bowl all right  guy in my hometown over the weekend died in five feet of water how does that happen a shark eats you 
[02:20:00]  that's how it happened it wasn't a shark oh why they were in the water standing quince quince from  jaws he almost only died in like two inches of water the guy goes takes a shark on his lower hand  the guy goes under yeah can't stand up i guess drowns drowns five feet of water they get the  bends a riptide nothing no they said there was none of that crap the suicide how do you die like that i  don't know he's in five feet of water five feet of water there his legs go out him is uh i don't know 
[02:20:30]  another family member and i don't know they go under or whatever and the guy never comes back  out he was four feet tall yeah that could be he wasn't four feet tall i think you should have uh  i think you should be able to just bitch out god when you die under circumstances like that you ever  see those people driving down the thruway or something and those big boulders that have been  staying up there for hundreds of thousands of years suddenly decides it's gonna fall in your car and  kill you like you're the goddamn coyote every time i drive through the cast kills i'm like i i don't want

[02:22:30]  that robinson who had uh balance problems since being born without one ear  being born with one ear wait you can't balance if you only have one oh yeah  uh had drowned following a significant head injury ow sucks to be you  ouch and you know something what's the only reason that made the news because it's a goofy death

[02:24:00]  going to put out a fire like that with anything but a fire truck yeah luckily they finally show up  with it but i mean jesus it was like ready to burn down people's houses and stuff it was the most  insane thing i've ever been asked i remember how these things happen uh when it when it happened  with me and my brother my brother's throwing matches on dry grass on a little hill and stomping it out  and each time he let it get a little bigger and a little bigger and i at one point thought it was too 
[02:24:30]  big again i'm in kindergarten i thought it was getting too big there i am with my little shoe  that you could dangle from a rearview mirror try and i'm now trying to stomp the fire out because  i'm thinking it's too big your fingers start melting no my brother grabs my foot like no let it get a  little bigger so now he's distracted trying to grab my foot when he finally turns around he noticed now  it did jump to a couple of spots he's now trying to stomp with his first grade shoe and it wasn't  work and that's when we decided to go to the house quickly and say do you have a hose to the 
[02:25:00]  horrified uh person in the house and when they ran uh that's when we ran away and tried to uh  make believe nothing that we try to wish it back to the cornfield i want to wish the fire to the  cornfield it just gets bigger and bigger and then you hear in the background you know  uh-oh now we're in trouble maybe it's not our fire maybe maybe they're maybe they're going to  someone else's fire no they just stopped right here it's our fire oh crap oh no 
[02:25:30]  all right man thank you man i've told my fire story way too many times it's horrifying when  you're a kid we're out of control we were burning little army man we were having a little war in  the woods and foot foot and the same thing you know you let it get a little bigger and stuff and  we want to you know you take a little chance gust of wind i swear gust of wind watch the fire just go  from here to a big pile of leaves over here that's all it takes now it's climbing now it's climbing up 
[02:26:00]  the tree just like that i mean the wood in my backyard was so damn dry and and now we're just little  kids kindergarten and younger trying to put out this damn fire our sneakers are melting we got we got  soot all over our faces come on stymie had a lot of woods in the backyard in centerport there and uh  the fire just went up the hill like within minutes within minutes it was like august it was really dry  and now it's literally uh 20 feet from the house at the top of the woods very good cops come uh the 
[02:26:30]  fire guys they put out the whole fire and then they line us up in the backyard because they know we're  guilty of something and shot you and uh no true story yes oh thanks thanks for distracting me  squad 51 engine 51. yeah that added to the story thanks ben um emergency i'm just messing with you  ramp rampart so so they lined us up in the backyard and now you got cops and pissed off fire guys just 
[02:27:00]  staring at us with their arms folded trying to get to the bottom of it and i remember i i learned in  uh in fire prevention was randolph man tooth there no no no randolph man tooth from emergency we were  we were that would have been the goofy story in emergency they always had three they had the goofy  story the serious story and then the sideline around the station house story remember the goofy  one where the the ladies bra got caught on on the toilet yeah and there was another one where the 
[02:27:30]  woman's toe got caught in the uh in the uh spout for the bathtub and they had to come in  they did play the goofy music it was it was the hottest show ever when they could show up and the  lady is stuck to the back of the toilet somehow or some somewhere in the yeah in the bathroom and  they find out that her bra is caught and she can't reach it for whatever reason and and the big joke is  like oh can i have to remove your bra and then right free yeah and then right at the punchline what would  you hear you'd hear that sound again uh-oh now the serious story heats up there's an overturned car 
[02:28:00]  on fire anyway so they line us up and i remember learning in school uh anthony earlier that week  in fire prevention that uh oily rags could cause fires yeah so as spontaneous combustion as serious  as what was me as serious as i could i told uh you know the fire chief there he asked me if i knew  anything about the fire and i said of course not sir but we saw the fire we went up there to try to put  it out but i i did see uh under uh a bunch of trees some oily rags oily rags you blamed it on spontaneous
