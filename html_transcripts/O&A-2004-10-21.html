<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with technical difficulties and immediately launched into a raucous discussion of the Yankees' ALCS collapse against the Red Sox, using copious amounts of offensive language.  Opie, Anthony, and Ben replayed past broadcast clips showcasing their shifting, often contradictory predictions.  Numerous vulgar caller comments further fueled the debate.  The show then played a comedic audio clip of George Bush singing rock songs, including “Sunday Bloody Sunday,” followed by an even more explicit parody of a Yiddish theater tune with graphic sexual content about mothers.  Listener calls detailed destructive Boston post-game celebrations.  The hosts recounted a dinner with a super agent, contrasting Norton's on-air persona with his attempts at polite conversation. A bet was made: if the Red Sox lost the World Series, Norton would perform a bizarre act involving his belly button and Anthony’s tongue.  The segment concluded with continued ALCS discussion, technical difficulties, and listener call-ins.

Next, Jim Norton recounted a dinner with friends, Bob and Robin, detailing his attempts at plausible deniability regarding his interactions with women and a humorous story about a picture of his phlegm mistaken for vomit. The conversation shifted to Robin's flirtatious emails with another man, unbeknownst to Bob, leading to a discussion about infidelity.  Numerous trucker callers shared their own infidelity experiences, including one caller who described a violent reaction to discovering his wife's affair.  The hosts engaged in a crude discussion of bodily fluids and sexual acts. A “Hi Mom, I got fired for masturbating” prank call was played, followed by more infidelity discussion and listener calls.  An upcoming guest appearance by Sully from Godsmack and an eBay auction of a signed Oompa Loompa t-shirt were briefly mentioned.

The following segment featured listener calls detailing revenge schemes after discovering infidelity: one caller was punched by a cheating woman's husband; another slim jimmed a car to confront a suspected adulterer; a third rammed his wife's lover's car, resulting in broken femurs. A police officer caller described using email and a hidden recording device to expose his wife's affair, leading to court-martials. The hosts shared a story about an early encounter with a woman whose husband later punched him.  A segment involved guessing whether audio clips were from horror films or pornography based on screams.  A listener’s encounter with a midget in a supermarket and a disastrous Super Bowl promotion requiring the hosts to watch the game with strangers were recounted.  The segment concluded with discussion of poorly planned promotional ideas (including a giant Pop-Tart remote broadcast and incorrect window clings) and missing rock memorabilia.

The show then featured anecdotes about a former employee, "Muni," known for his chaotic work habits, including misplacing equipment and using his bare hand to unclog a toilet. A game with guest "Martini Steve" followed, involving guessing whether graphic audio clips were from horror films or pornography.  The clips and their descriptions were extremely graphic, detailing anal sex and murder scenes, including a discussion of a snuff film.  They discussed a homemade compilation tape with graphic content, referencing the Bud Dwyer suicide video and a rap video made using it.  A wrong number prank call was played, followed by reminiscing about Stalker Patty, past firings, the cancellation of the Miss America pageant, and a topless swimming incident involving a high school swim team.  Further discussion of pornography and a game recap concluded the segment.

A "Hot Tee News" segment featured stories about a high school swim coach under investigation after a topless swimming incident on "Two Piece Tuesday," and two teenage girls who stole a car and drove across the country.  Both stories were discussed with crude humor.  Stalker Patty, a 49-year-old virgin, returned as a guest, engaging in sexually explicit conversation with the hosts about her virginity, lack of sexual experience, and a past encounter with Ron Jeremy. The hosts made numerous comments about her appearance and body, and discussed gynecological exams.  They suggested vulgar ways to help her lose her virginity.  The segment concluded with calls to other staff and a brief advertisement for Quoteland.com.

[00:00:00]  Flyin'  I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine  Mama, can you wait?  Mama, can you wait?  I love the cocaine, I love the cocaine  Mama, can you wait?  Oh, can you wait, oh?  Oh, yeah!  I love the cocaine 
[00:00:30]  I love the cocaine  I love the cocaine  I love the cocaine  Yeah!  We're just minutes away from another Opie and Anthony show  As we spread the ONA virus across America  Anthony's playing some video games in the office  Norton is trolling the internet for horrors  And I gotta run to the bathroom and take a crap 
[00:01:00]  We'll all be happy and we'll be on the air in a few minutes  Stay there!  Thor��  I...  I.  I.  Don't forget  I.  He.  I.  I!  chords  Ain't he.  You!  You!  I...  I... 
[00:01:30]  You!  I've all found one before  So I'm chilling  You!!!  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Thank you. 
[00:04:00]  Thank you. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you. 
[00:05:00]  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when there are bucks to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural  degradation that we do not want to be associated with anymore.  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock, rock, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker,  and tits.  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[00:05:30]  This time, this time, this time, this time.  Still not working right, huh? 
[00:06:00]  What's with the level?  Listen to this.  That's like that.  And that's real low.  Working out the bugs.  The Godfather clips are all low.  Really low.  Oh man, what the hell is that?  I can't even hear it.  And there's always just problems.  Problems, problems, problems. 
[00:06:30]  What the hell?  It's over, Johnny.  No, yeah, that one's up.  It's over.  Nothing is over.  Nothing.  You just don't turn it off.  I just wanted it's over, Johnny.  But that's kind of good.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah, I know.  It's over.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're just a tool.  Yeah.  It's the brand new Opie and Anthony Show on XM Satellite Radio.  And we're working out the bugs every single morning.  You got to see this place, man. 
[00:07:00]  It's like a NASCAR pit crew every morning, you know, replacing stuff and making the place workable, I guess.  Work.  Make it work.  So.  But we're on the air, right?  Cool.  All right.  We had to replace, I don't know, screens today and all sorts of crazy crap happen.  Yeah, they did a screen transplant over there, did they?  Yes, they did.  Great.  I'm sure it'll work for, well, a day or two.  Who knows?  But Jaime's back in town and Jaime takes care of business. 
[00:07:30]  Although I'm hearing my mic cut out.  Oh, man.  So how are you doing, Anthony?  What?  I'm fine.  You know, I don't think we ought to dwell on sports.  I think it alienates a lot of the listeners, so let's just move on.  Let's just move on to something else.  Good point.  It's over, Johnny.  Where do we begin?  It's over, Johnny.  I guess we can begin by reading the front pages of all the New York papers. 
[00:08:00]  Daily News, the chokes on us.  Yikes.  Worst postseason collapse in baseball history.  Yeah.  The worst postseason collapse in baseball history.  Ben, shut up.  Ben's snickering over there.  Ben, who days ago was saying.  Shut up, you arrogant Yankee fan.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Ben, who was saying, oh, it's over.  I know it.  Socks suck.  You suck.  It's over.  I know it's over.  At least I got the Pats. 
[00:08:30]  Now, of course, they win, and now Ben's back to being a fan.  Well, you know what?  I grew up a Red Sox fan.  That's how we were trained to think.  What, Ben Wagon?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, Ben did give up on the Sox.  Ben gave up on the Sox like three days ago.  Yeah.  I have him on tape saying it's over.  In 96, when the Yankees were losing to Atlanta, two games to none, I didn't go, oh, the Yankees.  I'm not going to, you know, forget them.  Let's watch the Jets or the Cowboys.  Oh, all right.  You arrogant Yankee fan.  Arrogant Yankee fan.  Arrogant.  Arrogant.  They lost.  Got a history. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  And they lost.  They were outplayed.  I will not sit here and say the Red Sox won by some fluke or anything.  They were able to pull it together and play the last four games much better than the Yankees.  That's for sure.  The Yankees had no pitching.  That Brown, oh, my God.  Did you just want to.  Why did they get him?  He's 39.  What are you getting a 39-year-old guy to be your starting pitcher?  Your ace.  He's never won a big game in his life.  He's going to be stunk in 98 in the World Series. 
[00:09:30]  I told you guys.  Right at the beginning of that game last night.  I told you guys.  I told you it was going to come down to pitching.  And the Yankees pitching staff is awful.  It was awful.  It's absolutely awful.  You know what, though?  When they won the first three games, you're like, ah, they can turn it around.  It's amazing.  They have this crappy pitching staff, but they're able to pull it up and pull it off.  And then they dump four in a row.  And, well, one thing I've got to say to Ben and the other Sox fans with the reverse the curse and all this stuff.  You haven't won this series yet. 
[00:10:00]  So, you know, keep it in perspective.  Oh, that was the World Series.  Yeah, okay.  That's the way Boston fans look at it.  And you know what?  That's how beaten up they are.  It's almost like a married couple where the husband and wife aren't getting along.  And she goes, well, at least he's not punching me in the throat anymore.  They've settled for the fact that if they just get through the Yankees, nothing else matters.  Right, right.  The curse has to do with the World Series, my friend, and the World Series.  Not LCS.  So we'll see.  You can play the clip back, but I would, you know, who would have thought?  Hold on.  I do want to play the clip because this is from about five days ago. 
[00:10:30]  Anthony and Ben going at it, talking about the series here.  Listen to this.  From five days ago.  I'm already looking at Game 7.  It looks like it's going to be Game 7 here in New York, Anthony.  You're going to look at Game 7.  Not between the Yankees and the Red Sox.  I was the only one that said it was going to go to Game 7.  This was when the Sox were down 3-1, by the way.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  I want to say something today.  I think officially my sports curse is over, by the way.  No, it isn't. 
[00:11:00]  You were so wishy-washy with both teams.  Shut up.  You were so fucking wishy-washy.  One day, I didn't know who you were rooting for one day to the next.  I never gave up on the Red Sox.  Was it the Sox?  One day, it's the Yankees.  One day, you gave...  Find the audio.  You were John Kerry on this series.  Find the audio.  You gave no commitment.  I did not...  You gave no commitment to either team on this whole series.  Find the audio that I was rooting for the Yankees.  Find the audio.  I did not fear one or the other.  There is no sports curse.  Look, man. 
[00:11:30]  You came in here one day wearing a hat with an N, a Y, and a B on it.  Right.  Nobody knows where you stood.  Yeah, right.  Find the audio of me trashing the Red Sox.  I didn't get an audio of you trashing the Red Sox.  There was no commitment on your part whatsoever to either team.  Ope has two lives.  His on-air life and his off-air life.  When I said off-air, there's no proof of it.  I heard no commitment for either team.  I was rooting for the Sox the whole time.  No, you aren't.  Let's go back to the audio from five days ago.  Three more, guys. 
[00:12:00]  Three more in a row.  Oh, and they did it.  Stop it.  Let's be realistic here.  It's three to one.  Three more in a row, guys.  That's all you need.  It ain't gonna happen.  Did you forget the three...  The spankings you got prior?  Did you forget?  I didn't forget.  I'm the only one that has any idea that we are not going to win this.  That's Ben right there.  We are not going to win this.  That was a realistic bet.  We are not going to win this.  I didn't think we could.  Way to go, Ben.  How can you call the Yankee fans arrogant?  If your point of view is realistic, how can you... 
[00:12:30]  Oh, you Yankee fans are arrogant.  I loved watching you all in the streets last night all rejected.  Way to support your team.  We don't know what it feels like.  The Yankee fans don't know what...  We've never taken it in the face like that before.  Even if you believe that your team's not going to get the job done, you don't say it.  You've got to support your team right to the end.  That's right.  Even Earl called me and congratulated me.  For what?  You didn't win?  We won.  We won.  They did.  Why didn't he call Ortiz and congratulate him and his stupid Black Rock Coalition?  It's impossible.  Thank you. 
[00:13:00]  I'm glad there's a realistic Sox fan here because the other ones...  It's never happened, first of all, in baseball history.  Never happened.  Where someone's come back.  Someone's come back.  From a three-zip deficit.  Never happened before.  We understand that.  And the Sox, this hope, this hope that they got, that they're going to be the team that  does it.  The team that chokes, that chokes every year.  Stop it.  There it is.  Oh, boy.  From a few days ago.  I'll be honest.  This loss doesn't hurt.  There it is.  Now I know why politicians never say anything. 
[00:13:30]  They never answer questions.  They never really give a commitment one way or the other.  It's so they can't pull tapes like that one.  Oh, my God.  For me, to be honest with you, I don't really care about Boston.  The worst collapse in baseball history.  All I cared about was getting through the Twins.  I mean, for me, that was the key to this year.  The Yankees-Minnesota rivalry.  Oh, Joe Torre is so fired.  No, he's not.  And he shouldn't be.  You don't think so?  No.  He is so fired.  They have a picture of him in the paper yawning before the game.  Absolutely not.  He's not fired. 
[00:14:00]  Maybe the guy should have got a few winks before game seven.  Why?  Is it his fault that Cashman and Steinbrenner go out and get a 39-year-old bag of shit like  Kevin Brown or like Javier Vasquez?  But he was a nice guy.  He seemed like such a nice guy.  We could sit and chat about anything.  Steinbrenner is the one who did not let them trade Pettit all those years.  I mean, Joe Torre is the one that stopped them from trading Pettit all those years.  Yeah, I know.  Pettit years ago.  They would have dumped Bernie years ago.  I had no.  Well, Pettit was going to be useless no matter what this year.  But you don't know that.  I don't go by that. 
[00:14:30]  You don't know that at the beginning of the year.  Yeah, you're right.  If it was different circumstances, maybe he wouldn't be injured.  Yeah.  Daily News, on page three, they got a big, huge picture of Babe Ruth with a tear in his  eye, Anthony.  And it says, beat the Yankees.  Oh, wait.  Maybe that's only half of the headline, unfortunately.  But you get the idea.  The curse is the World Series, my friend.  It is the World Series.  It's not the LCS.  And do they look very good this year?  Of course they do.  They spanked the Yankees four in a row like that to eliminate them in disgrace. 
[00:15:00]  I'll give you all that.  All that.  But you haven't won the World Series yet.  And also, you New York fans are going to get spanked on Sunday by the Pats.  So it's going to be a great weekend for us New England fans.  Let's calm down now.  Yeah.  Come on.  Todd, what's going on?  Hey, Anthony, I just got to let you know, you're the man.  I am not a New York fan.  But yesterday, you said, and I wrote it down so I could call in and give you a hard time.  Oh, boy.  You said, if they win, if the Cubs, if Boston wins, they deserve the respect. 
[00:15:30]  I can look back and say that they pulled it together, and I am impressed with that.  And that's exactly what you said this morning.  So I want to let you know, I'm impressed.  You're the man.  I'm very impressed by the Sox.  Also, you got another part right yesterday, too.  You said Joe Torre will be able to get on and start whining and crying and go, oh, I'm  so proud of these kids.  Actually, that's Steinbrenner.  Steinbrenner, yeah. 
[00:16:00]  But Joe Torre tends to break up in the interviews also.  Yeah.  A couple more phone calls here.  And I, for one, I'm not going to take the high road.  I hope the Red Sox find anthrax in their bottled water.  Fred from Boston.  What's going on?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Yes.  Hey, Rocco says hi.  Oh, good old Rocco.  Shut up.  So what do you got today, buddy?  I just wanted to say, you know, the Pats are going to take you guys this weekend, and the  Red Sox are number one.  Let's calm down with the Pats, okay? 
[00:16:30]  I was rooting for your Sox, but that's where it ends.  Hey, you guys are doing it wrong.  We're going to go for three.  You know, you guys have your dynasty up in New York.  Oh, wait, wait.  Would you...  They're talking dynasty?  No, no.  Shut up.  Sorry about the Patriots.  Oh, okay.  I thought...  Oh, no, but I wouldn't put it past Sox fans to all of a sudden start talking dynasty.  Those idiots falling off.  Haven't won the series yet.  Dynasty.  The Sox fans better enjoy this year, because half the team isn't even going to be there next 
[00:17:00]  year.  That's right.  Steinbrenner probably...  Steinbrenner's going to get...  I think Jordan's going to get...  Maybe go out and get a couple more.  A couple of those guys.  Maybe Johnny Damon.  Yeah, yeah.  Sign him up.  Yeah, we'll sign him up.  We'll look at the Sox.  Decide who we want and take him.  And take him.  You know?  Pedro's going to be a Yankee next year.  You are.  I don't want him.  Pedro did nothing.  Shelly pitched a great game on...  What was...  Not yesterday, the day before.  Game six.  Right.  He was great.  Right.  But Pedro is a choke artist.  He's done nothing.  He hasn't beaten the Yankees once.  Why'd they put him in last night?  I don't even get that one.  I think it was more just to try to shake that monkey off his back. 
[00:17:30]  I think...  And he's...  I don't know.  I think it had something to do with that.  But he's...  Pedro's...  And then Johnny Damon decided to wake the F up.  Oh, he decided he was going to play.  He decided, you know what?  I'm ready to start hitting the ball.  He's like, why not?  We're playing...  Oh, why not?  Oh, this is important?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  They keep showing these droves of Sox fans outside of the various bars in Boston.  I guarantee you that's a lie.  It's a lie shot, too, knowing Boston.  It is a lie shot.  Let's go to Rob in Long Island. 
[00:18:00]  What's up, Rob?  What's up, Peggy?  Hey.  How you doing, Rob?  How's my good buddy Norton doing this?  Hi.  I've been better.  Yeah, Norton was so depressed he had to go get a hooker.  We'll talk about that in a second.  But go ahead, Rob.  So, Anthony, you wash your foot off before you put it in your mouth this morning?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, you know, what would you have me say?  Oh, nothing.  I just wanted to come on and just laugh at shit.  But you know what?  I'm past it.  You know, you made up for it.  You said your piece.  So, uh, like this. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  Thank you.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Let's get it.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  This is Joe Torrey in Steinbrenner's office.  I've got nothing else. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not very good.  Hey, Kevin and Poughkeepsie, what's going on?  Good morning.  Morning.  Morning to you.  Now we know what it looks like to bring a knife to a gunfight.  Last night's game.  Really?  Did someone show up to a Battle of the Wits unarmed, you 1941 expression user?  Yeah.  Bobby Bigrigger checking in.  What's up, Bobby?  What's going on, guys? 
[00:19:30]  Well, time.  Hey, you know, Ben's defense there.  I guess the Red Sox fans, they kind of feel like that abused child that's been beaten every  day, and they come to find out that Daddy's not coming home today.  Yeah.  We understand.  We're happy that Ben is happy.  Yeah, Ben didn't have much confidence in his own team.  That's for sure.  Oh, come on.  We got it on tape.  I know, but.  He didn't have confidence.  He didn't have confidence.  And I think we can pull a lot of tape of you going, yeah, I know.  Oh, it's over.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Fine.  Do it.  But after that third game, do you think they look like crap?  Let's be honest. 
[00:20:00]  They look like crap.  And so the Yankees pitched.  Even though the Yankees killed them, they still, they gave them eight runs.  I know.  I guarantee, and ask any realistic Sox fan that would have thought they'd beat them  four games in a row.  Yeah, that's true.  And win two games in the Yankees team.  No, be realistic.  Everyone wants to talk.  No one would have thought that.  Come on.  Hey, look.  The Yankees got another record.  Man, that's going to be a hard one to.  They're going to be bringing that one up for years to come.  Oh, the Boston Papers are loving that one.  The only team to ever blow a three-zip lead. 
[00:20:30]  That's the worst part.  2004 New York Yankees, everybody.  It's not even the loss, which annoys me.  It's not even the loss.  It's the fact they blew a three-nothing lead.  Three-nothing lead.  I think they may have gotten a little lackadaisical.  Yeah.  Thinking they have it in the bag?  Who cares?  You've got to hate David Ortiz.  No, I don't.  You've got to hate him, man.  But before the series, I was telling you.  I love seeing that fat ass in a Yankee uniform.  He's good, man.  Isn't it going to be great?  He's a great player.  Let's say hi to Mike in Long Island.  How we doing, guys? 
[00:21:00]  Good.  Hold on.  Falling down.  Falling down.  Always running.  It's Castro.  Watch Fidel Castro fall off a step.  Sorry.  We're on his face on the news.  We watch the TV as we do the show.  I'm thinking no one laughed at him, either.  And they got a shot of...  She's laughing, too.  With Laurie Stokes, Chattel 7 News, here's Fidel Castro falling on his face.  That was great.  What was the deal with him?  Did he trip?  He was walking.  He fell off a step.  He didn't see a step.  You ever do that when you're walking and there's a step there and you go, oh, I almost pull  your spine out of your ass? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Mike from Long Island, what's up?  Opie, you were talking about your sports curses all the time.  I seem to remember in the old days that your curse only came when you were definitive about  a win, not the way you were this time, where you were rooting for him, but you  never said definitively that they were going to win any game.  Yeah, Opie was the John Kerry of this series.  Oh, come on.  He just...  No commitment.  I committed.  One side or the other.  You said the Yankees.  Look, look, look.  I remember you saying...  Look, here's the deal. 
[00:22:00]  The Yankees will pull this off a couple of days ago.  I do remember you saying it.  Saying, no, the Sox will win a couple of games, but the Yankees will take it.  There's no tape of that, Anthony.  I absolutely believe that.  Let me explain to everybody.  I was rooting for the Sox, yes.  But not with passion.  I'm a Mets fan.  That's why.  Mets fans don't like the Yankees.  Mets fans aren't big fans of the Sox either, my friend.  And vice-y-versy.  I understand.  That's for sure.  But they actually got the better of the Sox. 
[00:22:30]  They haven't been humiliated by them since their inception.  Or as you would say, since their conception.  Since their conception.  Thank you.  So far, I've pronounced everything perfectly.  Well, Opie, let's look at some of the Boston fans, shall we?  Okay.  While the majority of the World Series starred fans expressed their joy peacefully, vehicles  were vandalized near Fenway, including several Boston Public Works trucks, smashed windows,  and roofs and hoods of vehicles crushed in.  Fans lit Yankee T-shirts on fire and ignited fireworks, while others danced on top of cars, 
[00:23:00]  leaving them dented and damaged.  And with Boston, you know, it was just bad white guy dancing on the hoods of the cars.  Boston police took several people into custody as bottles rained down onto Lansdowne Street  from the top of the Green Monster inside the park.  And outside, a woman apparently pelted with bottles was left bloodied on the sidewalk.  There you go.  A fire was set in front of Pizzerina Uno in Kenmore Square,  and young fans danced around the flames. 
[00:23:30]  Another bonfire of shirts, papers, and anything that would burn was ignited in front of the  cask and flagon, where Joplin fans made their way to the roof.  When did they move Fenway to Southie?  I know.  What the hell's going on?  It sounds like Southie.  Police sporadically fired pepper balls at some destructive fans,  but were effective in preventing a major free-for-all by limiting the ability of crowds to move.  Flower planters were dumped in front of the Hotel Commonwealth. 
[00:24:00]  Flower.  Those are the outskirts people that really didn't want to commit to violence.  Dumping over flower planters.  And rolls of toilet paper were turned into streamers.  And at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell,  campus and city police donned riot gear to corral hundreds of students who flooded the campus  in celebration but quickly grew out of control.  Officers were ordered to retreat and regroup before trying to quell the disturbance.  In which bottles were reportedly tossed at cops from rooftops and windows.  That sounds like, all in all, a fun night up there in Boston. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, but that happens in every city.  Every city has some kind of craziness after a big win.  No, New York doesn't do that.  We riot during blackouts, police beatings, things like that.  We're just so innocent here.  Not sports fans, though.  They're still out, though.  I just got a text message from one of my friends.  They're all out at Fenway.  There's people still out.  There's a live shot right there.  A few more games to play against an undetermined team yet. 
[00:25:00]  Go Astros!  I'm not sure who I'm a huge fan of yet.  I'm sure I will be a huge fan of either St. Louis or Houston.  You will be making your decision after you surf the internet a little while.  A couple of games, I'm going to know every player of one of those teams.  I already see you've got stat sheets in front of you and everything.  I'm studying it up.  You're studying it up.  How about calling Vegas?  I'm going to be a huge fan of one team or the other.  I look forward to see who Anthony wants to beat the Sox in the World Series.  How about Clemens winning?  Actually, yeah.  Clemens, I would love to see the Astros. 
[00:25:30]  I would love to see Clemens win.  Clemens walking into Fenway.  How cool would that be?  Yeah, yeah.  How cool would that be?  He's so loved in Boston.  I know.  That's why I kind of want to see that.  That'll be fun.  All right.  A couple more calls here, and we'll move on to other things.  Steve, what's going on?  From Nebraska, right on.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah, hey, not much.  No disrespect to any of you guys.  The show is awesome.  You guys are all awesome.  But I will say, even though Anthony had to eat crow on this whole thing with the Yankees  and the Red Sox, he's the only one on the United Station that stuck to his guns the whole time 
[00:26:00]  through this series.  Thank you, my friend.  Right down with the ship.  I went right down with that ship.  What did I do, sir?  Start rooting for the Cardinals?  For the Yankee fans since I was eight.  That's true.  So who are you picking, Anthony, in the World Series, between Boston and who do you think  it's going to be?  He does not want the Red Sox to win.  No, I don't want to.  I'm hoping the Astros are in there, and I would love to see.  I just want to see the Boston disappointment. 
[00:26:30]  That's all.  I want them to be ten times more disappointed than I am and a lot of the Yankee fans are  this morning.  That's all.  One more here.  Let's go to Rob in Connecticut.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, man.  First time caller.  Glad you guys are back on.  Oh, thanks.  Glad to be back on, Rob.  Glad to be back on.  I know.  I just want to say that I hope Boston wins all the way.  I'm not a baseball fan at all, but these guys are like pent-up virgins.  If they win, they're going to explode and burn down Boston.  Mm-hmm.  You know what I hear also while I'm watching the game? 
[00:27:00]  At the end of the game, I hear the last out was coming.  I have the remote in my hand.  I swear, I have the remote in my hand.  The second that ball is caught, and that's all I hear.  I turn it off.  I cannot sit and watch that.  I cannot watch the jubilation, the celebration on the field.  Oh, when my team loses, I have to watch.  No.  I have to watch the other team celebrate.  Bam.  I have my finger on the channel changer.  No, I have to watch.  And ball. 
[00:27:30]  And ball.  And ball.  That's all I heard.  Man, A-Rod looked pissed.  Of course.  They all looked pissed in the dugout.  I can't watch it.  They're all like, what happened?  What the?  Where are the Yankees?  What happened?  I thought we were, what?  What?  What happened?  All right.  Haven't won anything yet, my friend.  Why don't we take a very quick break here, and then we'll talk about Norton.  He was so depressed he had to get a hooker last night, which leads into the dinner with  the super agent that we got to get into.  That's odd.  I've heard sometimes, I was so happy I got a hooker.  Yeah, it really is like a, it doesn't really matter what no occasion is. 
[00:28:00]  I was pensive.  I got a hooker.  No, but he wanted to, I think you wanted to punish yourself, right?  A little bit?  In a weird way?  Well, if you look at it, it was probably more punishing her.  Well, it depends what the girl looked like.  I'm assuming you didn't go back to New York Confidential.  No.  Or nyconfidential.com, I should say.  There's no game eight?  No game eight, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  All right, we're getting lots of requests for this thing, so we're going to play it here.  George Bush singing Sunday, Bloody Sunday. 
[00:28:30]  And we got another song?  Yeah.  Done by the same guy?  There's a guy out there that just goes over all of Bush's speeches and then gets the lyrics  of rock songs and then puts it to music, and it's kind of like George Bush singing the  song.  Yeah.  It's really creepy.  We debuted this yesterday, George Bush singing Sunday, Bloody Sunday.  And a little later on the program, we got him doing Imagine slash Walk on the Wild Side.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  CD players are a little messed up here, but let's see if we can get this to work.  There's been a lot of talk about this next song. 
[00:29:00]  This song is not a rebel song.  This song is Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  I can't believe the news today.  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long, how long must we sing this song?  How long?  Too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight. 
[00:29:30]  Tonight.  Let's roll. 
[00:30:00]  And the battle's just begun.  This many lost and young who has won.  The treasure's dug within our hearts.  Mothers, children, brothers, sisters, born apart.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  How long?  How long?  Must we sing this song?  How long?  Too, too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight.  We can be as one. 
[00:30:30]  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online.  The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember.  Bark, bark, dot, dot, dot.  Wipe the tears from your eyes.  Wipe your tears away. 
[00:31:00]  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your love, shot eyes.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Sunday.  Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  And it's true, not a mean 
[00:31:30]  One fact is fiction and TV reality  And today, the million smart  We eat and drink while tomorrow they die  Sunday play Sunday  Sunday play Sunday  Sunday play Sunday  Sunday play Sunday  It's time to find 
[00:32:00]  America's sexiest state  Let's hear it for Illinois  Horse gag  Wow  Best shot in the mouth since our Bud Dwyer  Think you can beat him?  Call Opie and Anthony at 866-WOW-1-WOW 
[00:32:30]  And give it your best shot  Folks, it's important to remember the old days of the Yiddish theater  That's right  This very Bowery ballroom was a Yiddish theater years ago  And right now, I want everybody to remember that no matter what you do in life  No one is more important than your mama  For those of you who love Yiddish theater, perhaps like us 
[00:33:00]  You'll recognize this tune that we humbly offer  So you saw some tale in the fat man's yard  She's kind of old  But you were already hard  You jumped the fence  And you're ready to go  But there's one thing  I'd like you to know 
[00:33:30]  Hey mister  That's my mama, you're stupid  Thank you very much  Enter her gently  For her hair pie is drooping  Show her respect  As you cream in her douche  Remember  I sprang out of that bush 
[00:34:00]  Thanks mister  To you, she's a cum dumpster  But that skanky old pound  She raised our whole litter  Cause that wasn't a round  Asshole  I was the ninth pup  Yes, I was the runt  She had only eight nipples 
[00:34:30]  So I went for her  You know what I'm saying  I'm not going to say it again  Out of respect for mama  What we had  Was about more than mere nourishment  So maybe  Let her see you  Just once  From the front  Please be kind  As you break your cock off 
[00:35:00]  In mom's behind  Have control  Don't pop out  And get it into mom's wrong hole  While inside  Think about my mama's pride  How she beamed with joy  At my very first school  And then she ate it  She ate it  She ate it  Hey, hey, hey mister 
[00:35:30]  Geh's in mama  Kach in stup  Mein mythisch snatchbox  Ein suckel  Clamsoup  Schlein' for burger  Mit a bisser  Steigen slag  Jesus quid kischke  Mach his vlad  Gesacht  Mama 
[00:36:00]  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Mama  Thank you. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:37:00]  The phone's going crazy today, man.  Huge win for the Red Sox last night.  The greatest collapse in baseball history for the Yankees.  And Houston plays the Cardinals tonight.  Game 7, Clemens on the mound.  Can't wait for that game.  Let's say hi to Sean in Boston. 
[00:37:30]  Hey, Sean.  And by the way, I guess the game will be on one of the XM channels.  If I was up on my homework, I could tell you what channel the game's going to be on.  Wait, what did Ben say yesterday about the XM was on home plate or something?  Oh, it was unbelievable, man.  I didn't see it.  The whole top of the first inning, you could see the XM logo right behind home plate.  Right behind home plate.  Thank God it was the beginning of the game while the Yankee fans were still watching the game.  It was great placement for XM Satellite Radio.  Yes, they made that huge deal with Major League Baseball yesterday, making XM Satellite Radio that much more gooder. 
[00:38:00]  It's an unbelievable deal.  We are so not used to being spanked, man.  What, the Yankees?  Major League Baseball is so not used to being, like, completely owned.  I think it's a bad loss.  This is not the worst sports loss at all.  The Arizona loss is the worst sports loss I'll ever take.  You know what the problem is, though?  I don't know.  We were completely owned for four games in a row.  But the problem is you guys are stuck with this team for a while, too.  No, we're not.  No.  Is that better?  George is going to blow everyone out.  He'll try to figure something out, you think?  As long as he doesn't panic and fire the wrong people. 
[00:38:30]  Cashman kind of stinks.  I mean, he did get us some good players, but Watson was the guy that built that team,  Bob Watson.  He was the GM that built the team, and then he just couldn't.  All right, let's go to Sean in Boston, because we've got to move on to other things,  because the rest of the country hates when we talk about that.  All right, I'm talking about Bob Watson and wondering why.  It's the number one story on the news.  I understand.  Good point, Anthony.  Hey, Sean, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey.  How do you think they're going to accept Pedro with open arms there, or what?  Hell yeah.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:39:00]  You think so?  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  Most hated Red Sox of all time, though.  It's not like the first time we've taken a Red Sox and made him a Yankee.  That's true.  Looks like Aaron made the wrong choice there, though, huh?  No, he played well for the team.  I mean, you know, if he played well, what are we going to do?  All right.  I think it's Jim Norton's buddy, Robert Kelly.  Bob Kelly on the line from New York City.  What's up, Bob?  Hey, fellas.  How you doing, Bob?  Hey, Bob.  Hey, Jim.  Hi, Anthony.  How you doing today?  A little rough this morning.  A little rough. 
[00:39:30]  How you doing, Jim?  I thought you'd be street pizza by now.  No, I'm not.  I actually did look out the window and think, well, that would be kind of...  I heard you walked out of the cellar and you're one of your little angry fits with your  little hands wanting to punch a wall like stupid fat jaw brown.  You're fucking, fucking Yankees.  God damn it.  Fucking, God damn it.  Fucking asshole.  When we were leaving dinner and the game was already 2-0 in socks, he was already having  tantrums.  Was he punching the table and the forks were flying around? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah, he was just awful.  Did that Fatso Patrice call in?  Because he's supposed to call in, too.  Why?  He's not a baseball fan.  He's from Boston.  He's a Boston fan.  Don't kid yourself.  You know, he felt like David Ortiz.  There's no reason for him to call in.  You know who you got to feel bad for?  No, my.  No, my.  Poor, no, my.  Poor, no, my.  I just love seeing that stupid A-Rod, that juicy lip piece of shit, sulking in the dugout.  He did nothing for you guys this year.  That sexy, he dyes his hair and Jeter with his sexy eyes. 
[00:40:30]  You guys lost to a Neanderthal and a fucking silverback gorilla.  All of our crazy hairdos and our shitty beards and you guys lost, you friggin' assholes.  And it makes me proud.  And Ben, you, Ben, stand up to those two pussies.  Be a man.  Son of a bitch.  I want to make a bet with you, Anthony, right now.  A bet?  I want to make a nice, juicy bet with you.  All right.  What's your wager?  You think we're going to lose the World Series, right?  I didn't say I think you're going to lose. 
[00:41:00]  Get me.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  I didn't say I think you're going to lose.  I said, I hope with all that is me, with my entire essence of being, that Boston loses.  Whether I think they're going to lose or not, they look very good.  They got a good team.  They have, obviously, they have heart.  No, you're right.  They have the ability to come back from a three-game deficit.  You've got to give that to them.  I made a mistake.  You said for the last three days they were going to lose.  Yeah, right up until they didn't lose, I said they were going to lose. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, I thought you said spider on my right.  I've never heard Yankee fans use the word, I hope.  We never had the hope before.  It's always...  It's just a given.  It's our birthright.  I just love the fact that it's the only way that we ever could have ever won this game.  Here's that fat though right now.  Patrice is calling me.  Call the stupid...  Why is he calling you?  Do you think I should call in now?  For what?  He just wants to call in and laugh in your face.  No, he doesn't.  I just think the only way we ever could have won this game is by making history. 
[00:42:00]  And you guys made history.  The worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Now, what is the bet you were going to make with Anthony?  Yeah, let's go.  I want to make this bet right now, Anthony.  If the Red Circs sucks, don't win the World Series.  Shut your face.  I'm really a nervous asshole.  Look at this to you, you nervous Nelly.  First of all, 6 in the morning, what the fuck?  Second of all, I'm just such an excited asshole.  I'm on the radio, Mom. 
[00:42:30]  I'm going to record it.  Hey, listen.  I suck.  My hand's shaking like I'm doing my first television appearance.  All right.  So if the Red Circs don't win...  The Red Circs don't...  The Red Circs don't...  The Red Circs don't...  The Red Circs don't...  If they don't win the World Series...  Yeah.  ...I will allow...  I will come into the studio...  Uh-huh.  ...at 6 in the morning...  Yeah.  ...and I will allow Jim Norton to stick his finger in his belly button...  Oh.  ...and rub it, rub it, rub it. 
[00:43:00]  And rub it.  If the Red Circs don't win, he can rub it on the back of my tongue.  Oh!  On the taste buds.  Well, we got to remind people that made you puke one other time, right?  Well, me touching his tongue would disgust me.  So how about under the nose?  I won't touch your awful tongue.  You can put your finger anywhere.  Okay.  But it'll guarantee that you puke, right?  Like the last time?  Let me tell you something.  Don't watch that belly button for a week, Jimmy.  You can do whatever you want the night before.  You can be with the She-Mail.  You can have the She-Mail shit on you. 
[00:43:30]  You can do whatever you want.  I don't care.  You can stick your finger in your belly button and put it wherever you want.  All right.  So the bet is this.  If the Red Circs lose, I can put my finger in my belly button and rub it anywhere.  I really stink on the radio.  This is my last call-in.  No.  It happened.  It started off really well, so...  It really did.  All right, Bob.  Thank you.  Wait a minute.  What do I get if they win?  Oh.  Oh.  It's such an impossibility.  We don't even need to consider that.  The pleasure of calling the Opie and Anthony show again. 
[00:44:00]  How about this?  You have to announce that I'll be at the Stress Factory from the 18th to the 20th.  All right.  Deal.  Okay?  All right.  There he goes.  Bob Kelly.  I see you, stupid.  Friend of the show.  Fellow comedian.  All right.  Let's say hi to Troy.  He's just taking it hard, man.  Idaho.  Idaho checking in.  What's up, Troy?  Hey, what's going on?  Come on.  Patty.  Hey, I just want to say you guys suck.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Hey, I just called in because I've been listening to you guys' show since this weekend. 
[00:44:30]  My buddy turned me on to you guys.  You guys are the best, man.  All right.  You rock.  Spreading that virus.  Yeah, thank you for doing that.  So what do you want to hear today?  Well, I've heard giving head on a lot.  I've heard them, you know, having sex.  But we haven't heard a guy eating a girl out yet.  No.  All right.  Well, maybe that'll happen today.  We're looking for the sexiest state in America.  And so far, it's Illinois that's in the lead. 
[00:45:00]  Illinois picked it up yesterday, man.  With that little gagging BJ thing.  Illinois is bomb.  I lived here for three years, man.  All right.  Well, we'll see if we can get another couple from another state to do some stuff for us today.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Well, I'm on my way to Phoenix.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm on his way to Phoenix.  There he goes.  He lives in Idaho.  He was in Illinois.  He's like a serial killer.  It's a truck driver.  That's their life, bro.  He has a little ribbon with blood on it in his passenger seat.  They just had the Hooter Girls on TV.  They really got to update their uniforms, man. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, those bad shorts?  It's not 1985 anymore.  Get them in sexier outfits.  And the thick, tan-colored stockings.  Yeah, they don't even allow them to show real leg.  It's flesh-colored stockings.  Yeah, flesh-colored stockings to cover up a world of hurt, I think.  Who still goes to Hooters for that cheap thrill?  Not for a cheap thrill.  You go there, you know, if you want to get some wings and a couple of beers.  The girl comes up to you and flirts with you.  It's all just fake.  And they put the ice. 
[00:46:00]  They're doing you a favor by giving you a bag of ice for your pitcher of beer.  Is that still working?  You know what it is?  Their shorts are old, like, 70s shorts.  You need them to be cut a little higher on the hip, I think.  And lower down to show some ass thong or something.  Something nice.  Yeah, give the Hooters girls thongs.  Yeah, where it pops out of the top.  And low-cut jean shorts.  Low-cut in the front so you can see, like, some pube mound.  That would be nice. 
[00:46:30]  And duct tape over the mouth.  Yeah.  Like they just point at the item you want and they go, mmm, and they come get it and come back.  Right.  All right, so what happened with you last night after I left you?  You went and got the hooker?  Hey, you two went out to dinner?  Sorry, I was coughing.  You two went out to dinner?  Just cough in the air.  This isn't a professional radio show.  Why are you using cough buttons all of a sudden?  Because I've had a cough and you'd hear me cough every two seconds.  So what?  I sniffle.  How attractive is that?  But there's no sniffle button.  I've been, like, sneezing live on the show.  When did you start using a cough button? 
[00:47:00]  It's the only thing that works around here.  I figured I'd use it.  When we went on Sean Hannity, they're like, okay, and if you need to cough, here's your  cough button.  You just push that button and it'll turn your mic off so you can cough and no one will hear  that in Radio Land.  I like the cough button.  Why?  Just cough.  I'm a hack.  This show's a mess.  And you want to, like, start hitting the cough button?  I was using the cough button.  Oh, my God.  Are you auditioning for another radio show?  Ha, ha, ha.  You want to be taken seriously?  Yes, I... 
[00:47:30]  Oh, using the cough button is what's going to put me over the top.  I don't talk about sticking wiffle ball bats up chick's ass, but he used the cough button.  Bring him in.  Political talker.  That's what we need.  I think you're going to become a political talk show host eventually, Anthony.  Yeah, one of these days.  Hey, if this was Yankees on this show, they'd have a choke button.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Ha, ha, ha.  It's over, Johnny.  Yeah, it's over.  It's over.  It sure is.  Yeah, we went out to dinner with Super Agent Bob Eatman and his lovely bride. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, yes.  She's beautiful.  Mm-hmm.  And Bob's, uh...  Bob.  Bob has a great beard if you're starring in Philadelphia.  Yeah.  What is it with that little scrawny beard he's growing?  Bob walks in.  I've known Bob for, I don't know, he's been our agent for about six, seven years now.  And, uh, yeah, he walks into the restaurant with his beard, so now you've got to acknowledge  the beard because he's never had a beard before.  Uh-huh.  And it's like, oh, wow, Bob.  Uh, nice beard.  Yeah.  What do you say, you know?  Why did he grow a beard?  I have no idea. 
[00:48:30]  Is he trying to intimidate people?  That's what I'm thinking.  Is it like the evil Bob?  He grows a beard and wears a beret?  I know he has a lot of big meetings in New York in the next few days, so maybe he's trying  to intimidate.  Yes.  Maybe.  Maybe that's it.  Tough guy.  Put a little rubber band in it, like a Lou Albano.  Yeah.  Hey, you.  Grab the guy by the lapels.  Hey, you.  I got a client.  So, I don't know.  And you blew off the dinner.  I completely blew off dinner.  I knew you would.  So, I'm like IMing Norton, begging him, come on, please go to dinner with me.  I don't want to do this by myself.  Please, please, please, please. 
[00:49:00]  Here was my message from Bob's office last night.  Hi, Anthony.  Bob's office.  The dinner is going to be at, beep, message deleted.  How is it?  I didn't even care where it was going to be.  I got my email.  I saw the subject.  Restaurant.  Bob coming in.  Boink.  Delete.  I didn't want to know.  I didn't care.  And I'm running out of excuses for you.  You know what the excuse was?  He never knows ahead of time.  Yankee game. 
[00:49:30]  Well, that's the one I used.  I didn't get any sleep.  He shows up and he notices there's like an empty seat.  Oh, where's Anthony?  Oh, you know, the Yankees are on.  I mean, it's just, you know.  That's it.  At this point, I think he knows that you just don't want to hang out with him.  After I sign.  In a social atmosphere.  After I sign the contract with XM Satellite Radio, that's it.  Why do we have to go out to dinner anymore?  He likes to have a little quality time with us.  Unless he's got something to tell me business-wise.  We didn't talk any business either.  We talked about other stuff, but we did not talk about business.  No business?  Not at all. 
[00:50:00]  And Norton's waiting for me in the wrong restaurant going, where the hell is he?  He's getting all mad.  Where are you?  He's calling my cell phone.  I'm like, what do you mean, where are you?  I'm right at the bar.  He's like, so am I.  I'm like, no, you're not.  Turns out he's at the restaurant next door.  All these metrosexuals staring at me.  And they knew I didn't belong, and they were correct.  It was embarrassing.  I had to slink out with my awful coat.  His winter coat.  You didn't dress up for your dinner with Bob?  I wore a decent shirt.  No, no.  You know what?  Somehow we got to tape this, because Norton is a completely different person when he has to be. 
[00:50:30]  What do you mean?  He's just really nice.  He's clean-shaven.  He has a nice shirt on.  He's very polite.  Yeah.  He eats a lot better.  I have good table manners.  That's what I was trying to say.  Yes.  He has very good table manners.  I understand that, though.  I totally understand that.  I've been in situations where you have to be the nice guy, and you're on alert.  You're on nice guy alert for the whole time you're there.  Like dinner with a girlfriend's family when you're growing up, and you're still in school 
[00:51:00]  or something, and the girl invites you over.  Dinner with the family, and you're just completely aware of everything you're saying, everything  you're doing.  You can't screw up, and you've got that dopey smile on your face.  Like, all is right with the world.  I'm happy to be here.  I'm a gentleman.  You don't have to worry that I'm going to stick it up her ass.  You know, you've got to be a nice guy.  The grandmother makes a little joke, and you laugh politely.  Yeah, I know, I know, yeah.  Maybe add something in that makes them laugh in such a clean fashion.  Yeah. 
[00:51:30]  No, nothing blue.  That's right.  Like you said, Hitler was an underachiever.  Know what I've been known to say at these dinners when you're trying to impress the other  family?  Oh, boy.  Chicken.  Chicken.  Oh, boy.  Now, Bill, you're on your diet, Bill.  Oh, boy.  Bill, put the chicken down.  Love that movie.  Yeah, yeah.  So we're having dinner, and Norton and I are looking at each other just laughing because 
[00:52:00]  like we're getting just, we're burying each other, basically.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  At one point, Robin's, you know, Bob's wife there.  Robin.  That's right, Robin.  Robin is going to Norton.  I don't understand why you don't have a girlfriend.  You seem like a really nice guy.  So she does not listen to the show.  Oh, she listens to the show.  She's got problems with the show.  I don't like when you guys use the C word.  I just don't like that.  Wow.  I'm learning way too much about you, Opie.  I thought you were a really nice guy.  I'm like, oh.  See?  See, this is what I hate.  It happens in my own family and stuff. 
[00:52:30]  I don't want to talk about the radio show when we're not doing it with people like that.  You know, we know the type of show we need to do to get our audience.  We don't need like Bob's wife, you know, critiquing us at dinner.  We just don't.  Like, if Bob's wife says the show is hysterical.  Then I know we're in deep trouble.  You're right.  That's true.  I just don't.  I don't know.  I don't like that C word on the radio.  I'm like, well, whatever, man.  The show might not be for you.  Well, I know it's not for her, but I'm trying to be polite.  And it's like, and I want my kids. 
[00:53:00]  She's a mother of three.  I want my kids to listen to you, you know, and I just can't.  And they're begging me to put the show on.  It's like, what are you doing?  Shouldn't be children listening to this program.  Oh, and Bob heard all the crap we said about him.  Oh, he did?  I thought he was on a plane.  He's trying to play it off like, ho, ho, ho, ho.  I know it's just for the air.  He goes, why is my mic crapping out?  Is it the headphones?  It's your headphones, because I don't hear a crap out.  Oh, really?  Clear as a bell, Ope.  So, yeah, Bob heard all that stuff, and he's playing it off like, ho, ho.  I've been in this business a long time. 
[00:53:30]  I could take it.  I know what this is about.  But he said it like three or four times, which means he can't take it.  Right, right.  And he's really bothered by it.  Oh, no.  Because he knows we speak the truth when we say that he wanted us to shut our mouths  for the last two years so he could collect his 10%.  Because it comes down to money with everybody.  Who are you kidding?  So then Norton breaks out his digital camera, and she's like, oh.  Were there celebrities around?  Is that what happened?  No, we started talking about it.  I had a couple of good ones from the Trump roast with me. 
[00:54:00]  I forget how we started talking about it.  Because she's like, well, Bob loves to do that.  No, no.  So, like, get the pictures.  Maybe not how Norton likes to do it.  So, can I see your pictures?  And all of a sudden, in a panic, Norton's like, ah.  And he's, like, quickly scanning, making sure there's nothing too crazy in there.  And this is Voss's cock.  So then he realized he was safe, and they're going over the pictures.  But then it comes to a picture of a girl, but it's a video clip.  Oh, a little video clip?  And Robin's like, why do you have a video clip of this girl?  And what'd you say? 
[00:54:30]  Because I don't want to mess that up.  It was a picture of a girl.  And with the camera, what I had done was, I have a little video option on my camera.  Yeah.  So I pretend I'm taking a picture, but I'm actually shooting video.  An idea I got from somebody else.  But I'm actually saying, see, I'm trying to get a picture of you here.  You having a good time tonight?  Just to hear the girl going, oh, yeah, this is great.  On video.  Oh, man.  Not sexual to get sex, but you never know if some kook is going to freak out and say  that you did something bad. 
[00:55:00]  How many video clips do you have on file on your computer?  Dude, I should have been doing it all along.  I've only done it like once or twice.  It's only with somebody who I don't know that well.  But this is what he does.  He gets evidence on his camera.  No, you don't have to.  You have to if you're living a certain lifestyle.  Then you have to.  If you're living the Jim Norton lifestyle, then you are in a situation where you have to  take video clips and just and get alibis.  You have to get people like to just confirm that they're having fun.  You don't know.  Someone might feel guilty. 
[00:55:30]  I mean, let's be honest.  They're not going to look at me and go, I'm glad I fucked him.  You know, I'm very realistic.  So they might wake up and go, what was I doing?  Right.  So she's advantage of me.  So she explains this to Bob's wife.  And she goes, well, maybe you shouldn't be inviting women like this up to your apartment.  Oh.  And I'm sitting there like, God, she has no idea.  And I didn't want to blow up your spot.  Yeah.  I'm going to say it again today.  Doesn't she listen to the show?  I didn't want to blow up your spot.  And I'm dying to just let her in on everything.  Do you understand that these are mostly hookers that come up here and they're drug addicts  and one of them is going to freak out one time and say something to try to get some money 
[00:56:00]  and I want some proof.  Uh-huh.  But you couldn't say that to Bob's wife.  So it was hilarious.  Nicest lady ever.  I know.  And then there's a picture of like a puke in a sink or something.  No, that wasn't.  What was that?  I think you know how we do little weird things for the listeners?  Because she was like, oh my God, and she got all freaky and handed the camera back.  And I thought, because of what we were talking about yesterday, I thought it might have been  a picture of a girl gagging.  Remember the puke bucket?  Oh, yeah.  I wasn't sure if it was the actual puke bucket.  It is the puke bucket.  That was the puke bucket?  It wasn't puke.  What happened was this. 
[00:56:30]  I was embarrassed.  When I was sick like last week, I was coughing up so much phlegm and I was just spitting  at the bucket.  Dude, it was two or three days worth of awful loogers.  Oh, man.  Stop it.  I'm going to.  I got a picture right here.  Show Anthony the picture.  It's not that bad, actually.  It's pretty bad.  But I was going to put it on the blog if I wrote about it or something.  I just wanted to have it because you can't.  It smelled, too.  It had that awful, sick breath smell.  Oh, God.  Stop it.  It's not that bad, Ant.  I'm telling you.  I got to drink water.  It's so funny that you get freaked out by this stuff. 
[00:57:00]  It's not that bad.  It's not that bad.  It's fucking...  Snot, to me, is a close second to shit.  No, it's not even snot.  It's only like...  See, it's just a bucket full of stuff.  Oh, God.  It's freaking out.  Damn it.  It's a bucket full of all...  Spittle.  I mean, it's just like...  Don't be shy.  Why is everybody so shy?  Oh, Jesus.  That's disgusting.  See, it's got a little bit of color on that one.  Hey, I just got an idea really fast.  What's that, O?  You know that the Red Sox obviously are in the World Series. 
[00:57:30]  What are the odds of getting World Series tickets for this radio show?  They don't get comments.  Now?  They just signed this massive deal with Major League Baseball.  Hey, that's right.  Give us a pair of freaking tickets to the World Series because I want to bring back the Boston  Clam Chowder Puke Fest.  Oh, no.  Oh, that was a good one.  That was hilarious, though, man.  Yeah.  That was so freaking funny.  We have to break that out for World Series tickets.  Our first contest.  Why not?  I know.  That would be great.  We made people eat Boston Clam...  We need really good seats to the World Series. 
[00:58:00]  We just have to do this.  It was the funniest freaking thing.  We did it for Super Bowl tickets last time around.  It was one of the funniest shows we've ever done.  Oh, yeah.  Just because of the reaction of Anthony.  He can't take it.  And these guys just...  Everybody just puking.  One guy would puke, and then other guys involved in the contest started puking.  It really is nothing funnier than someone gearing up to puke.  It was hilarious.  And everyone watching him is going, oh, oh, oh, oh!  There he goes.  And then when it couldn't get any worse, you had guys eating the puke, which made other guys puke. 
[00:58:30]  It was just so out of control.  Oh, yeah, for more tickets or whatever, they would need a piece of puke.  Yeah, we've got to get World Series tickets and bring back the clam chowder bit.  You wouldn't watch a porn video like some of these Brazil scat movies where the girls are like, you know, they're taking dumps on each other.  Oh, I watched those.  But they're vomiting on each other, too.  I watched that, too, yeah.  But it really...  It's so disgusting.  You can't watch those alone.  It's got to be with a room full of friends and stuff because you kind of laugh.  Oh, oh.  Because it's a goof.  Yeah, that's right, right.  Yeah, no, no.  Oh, yeah, yeah, I forgot about that. 
[00:59:00]  I thought I was, like, alone jacking off.  But you're right.  It was with friends laughing.  But, no, it's snot I can't take.  Really?  I am so...  I cannot handle snot.  If there was a snot video, I wouldn't be able to watch it.  Someone told me about a mistress who blew her nose in his mouth, which I...  Oh!  Oh, man.  I read that.  He's, like, a human toilet.  That just got me.  She blew her nose.  She put his mouth in her nose, and she blew her nose in his mouth.  That's bad.  That just got me.  Because even my own...  You know, you blow your nose, and then you do the roll-up-the-tissue thing and screw it 
[00:59:30]  in there, and then pull out a big rubber band.  I just can't handle it.  I skeeve.  I can't look at it.  I got to throw it away really quick.  You see, Voss's...  Voss will pull out boogers that should be hanging off a cave ceiling.  And this dirty, awful man, he wraps him up.  He has cigarettes in his ashtray, so he'll just, like, he'll go, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,  and he'll laugh, and then he'll just take the cigarette butt and, like, trape the booger  around it.  It's the filthy...  It's like he's making a pig in a blanket out of a booger and a cigarette butt. 
[01:00:00]  He's the worst person alive.  He is disgusting.  He wipes his boogers on the walls and stuff, too.  He's one of those guys.  He's awful.  He's an awful person from head to toe.  Anyway, so, yeah, Robin.  Bob's wife was trying to get to know Norton a little bit.  Just can't understand why he doesn't have a girlfriend.  Yeah, that's not me.  Well, I'm always polite around wives or girlfriends.  You have to be.  You gotta be.  Because if I had a girl with me who I, like, like, I want a guy to be polite or respectful.  I hate guys that just don't know the rules.  I'm a pig with you guys.  That's true. 
[01:00:30]  And then I made the mistake of telling Bob's wife that I'm having a problem with dumping.  Why would you tell her this?  I don't know.  Because there was nothing else to talk about.  You've been at these dinners.  You start looking at the ceiling going, what can we talk about next?  I look at my watch and go, oh, okay.  If I leave now, I can be home by.  So she's like, tell me more.  I'm a mother of three.  I can help you.  Oh.  So I'm telling her, like, I can't crap.  She's giving you motherly advice on taking a dump.  So then Norton is just looking like, I can't wait to, you know, talk about this tomorrow 
[01:01:00]  on the air.  So I might as well say it first.  And then she's asking me, well, what kind of food are you eating?  It might be too much fiber in your diet.  So I told her about the oatmeal.  And she's like, oh, it's the oatmeal.  And then she's like, I forgot what she told me to do.  Oh, she said to eat fruit.  Yeah.  Dried fruit.  Dried fruit.  And I tell you the joy that brought me when I realized that little faggoty snack he brings  in was the source of his misery.  Like, he can't take a shit because of that oatmeal he brings in.  Yeah.  That made me so happy.  You're backing yourself up.  It's like Elmer's glue and fiberglass you're putting in yourself. 
[01:01:30]  So then we're just discussing bowel movements.  You brought in more oatmeal today?  Yeah.  He's hiding it over there.  Now, you see?  You know what's going to happen?  You're going to back yourself up some more.  You know, we have to.  I promised them we wouldn't talk about this, but we have to.  That looks like the inside of my bucket, by the way.  Your oatmeal.  Thank God I'm just about done.  I don't care.  We have to talk about what's going on in their relationship.  What?  We have to.  What?  Did we promise them?  I didn't promise them. 
[01:02:00]  Is it?  I don't know.  Is it sexual?  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  It's hilarious.  Is it sexual, though?  Well, I think they kind of gave us the okay at the end of dinner, right?  Sort of.  I'm trying to be cool.  Like it matters.  With this new gig, I'm trying to be cool.  Because I actually want to have friends when I'm not on the radio.  Screw friends.  Let it rip.  The old show, it got to the point no one wanted to hang out with me because they knew we'd just  talk about them the next day.  There's a guy that lives in L.A. that really, really wants Bob's wife. 
[01:02:30]  And Bob knows it.  Bob's not stupid.  Bob's a man.  He understands.  But Bob's wife thinks that this guy is just being nice.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And Bob has to, like, tell her to stop emailing the guy.  Oh, boy.  This doesn't sound good.  Dude, this doesn't sound good.  No, I believe her.  It's like, she is just.  She's very nice.  She's very naive.  And very innocent. 
[01:03:00]  I mean, she's a mother of three.  So she really doesn't really get what's going on.  And, yeah, the guy pretty much has come on to her.  How is there an emailing relationship going on?  Bob wants it to stop.  For some reason, it's not stopping.  Look, anyone that's out there right now.  Hello?  You listening to me?  Anyone that's out there.  If your girlfriend or wife emails guys on, like, a nightly basis, they're sitting there chatting on AOL or emailing back and forth, getting emails from guys, there's something going on there. 
[01:03:30]  No matter what they say, it's not some innocent little thing.  It's a relationship.  It is a relationship that can blossom, that can go further and further.  Thank God Bob doesn't spend much time traveling.  The guy's on the road all the time.  And Bob, you know, Bob wants to beat the crap out of the guy.  And if he was taller than 5'5", I think he would do it.  Because I think this guy's, like, over 6'2", tall, you know. 
[01:04:00]  Is he handsome?  Supposedly he's handsome.  Is he handsome?  Have they traded pictures?  No, no.  How do they spark up a relationship where they're emailing?  Their kids are in the same class.  Oh, God.  And the mom.  Common ground.  Great, great.  This is good.  And this guy ran into Robin's mom.  I guess Robin used to know the guy.  Just, you know, as an acquaintance back in the day.  Bob, Bob, end this quickly.  This has been going on for a while because I asked for the update. 
[01:04:30]  And it was very uncomfortable when it brought it up at the table.  I'm like, so what's going on with this?  I'm not going to say the guy's name.  Why can't you say his first name?  No, I don't want to.  Because I don't want to.  Just whatever.  Why is he famous?  I don't know.  So, yeah, so this guy asked for Robin's cell phone number and calls.  And then Robin takes a call.  And, you know, I think in the beginning he openly just flirted with her.  And she's like, no, I'm not interested.  Thank you.  Anyway, I'm a mother of three.  I'm very happy with my husband.  I mean, she's playing it perfectly. 
[01:05:00]  I mean, she's not interested.  I swear to you.  Okay?  But the guy will not give up on it and starts emailing her and calling her anyway.  And then Robin, trying to get out of this, set this creep, she calls him the creep, up with her friends.  And so he's going out with her friends but still not happy and it's not working out.  And then I guess Bob took his wife on a romantic getaway for their 10-year anniversary up to the Napa Valley. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  And as they're driving, her cell phone rings.  No.  Yeah.  Her cell phone rings.  And it's on the speakerphone in the car and it's this guy.  How did he get the cell phone number?  He's had it.  How?  Why?  From Robin's mom, I do believe.  What?  No.  This, no.  Well, we talked about that.  My mom gave my number out to my ex-psycho girlfriend.  Dude, here's the rule of thumb.  They don't understand.  They're like, oh, you want to say how to Robin?  That's enough evidence right there.  Here's the rule of thumb you got to go by, guys and girls. 
[01:06:00]  If you know for sure that your mate isn't cheating on you, they might be cheating on you.  Now, if you think that your mate is cheating on you, they are cheating on you.  That's how it works.  I could speak for Robin.  She's not cheating on Bob and has no intention to.  I think, personally, I think she kind of likes the attention, a little bit of the attention that's going on.  You know how these things, they grow out of control. 
[01:06:30]  It's a virus.  It's like this show.  And that's what Bob's paranoid about.  Right.  And he very well should be.  He's a little worried.  He's like, you know, he wants.  These things don't stay where they are static.  They blossom.  He wants to nip in the butt, as they say.  But, you know, they're running into him at all the school functions.  Of course.  You know, it's not like this guy's from another city or another town.  Oh, this is bad.  Poor Bob.  He's in the same community.  Oh, poor Bob.  This is bad.  Bob was okay with it.  And then he realized that his wife is really hot.  And he walked by a mirror. 
[01:07:00]  And he's like, uh-oh.  I better do something here.  Because I don't know how Bob pulled that off.  I think Bob, that's why Bob grew the beard.  Oh, do you think it's...  I think he's trying to look sexier.  Trying to be a little more hip.  I think he's trying to look sexier.  He saw some, like, Kirk Douglas movie from the mid-70s.  He's like, ah, that's the look.  You're going to trade in the Vista Cruiser for a vet?  Try to be all hip?  Get an earring like Ed Bradley?  It's the earring.  And get a tat, yeah.  He's got to get a tat.  It's just very interesting what's going on, though, with this whole thing. 
[01:07:30]  Start working out.  Get all buff.  What kind of tattoo could he possibly get?  A lawyer with a thumbs up?  But there's frustration...  A dollar sign.  Yeah.  There's frustration in Bob's voice because he knows what this is all about.  He has no doubt in his mind.  And she is like, no, he's just being nice.  He's a little creepy, but he's just being nice.  No, first of all, a guy in that situation, he's always looking to take it further.  They're always looking for the score, which is to get laid.  That's the goal.  That's the goal.  He's not doing this to just be friendly and have this little platonic conversation thing on the Internet. 
[01:08:00]  It's not that way.  They look for the final goal is to get laid.  And the women are maybe looking for a little companionship, some conversation, something outside the humdrum of married life and raising kids.  It's a little bit exciting.  It's someone different.  And that can take off.  That can launch.  If the guy's smooth and starts talking, they got the rap. 
[01:08:30]  Hey, look, I'm not talking about something that's never happened here.  Stuff like this happens all the time.  Chris Rock has to nip this in the bus.  Chris Rock has that great bit.  Oh, I know.  The platonic friendship.  The platonic friendship.  It's BS.  It's the dick behind the glass.  In case of emergency, break glass.  What you're saying, basically, is if this guy has some type of smooth guinea voice and olive oil charm.  Nice.  I know what you're saying.  Now you'll get the hell out of here. 
[01:09:00]  Hey, there was...  I ain't no agent.  I heard that story.  My name is Bob Eatman, and he boys my father.  Really fast, the NYPD put in a request on the email.  Yeah.  You know, when you guys are doing the lines back and forth, and I get most of the movies.  They're like, could you just give us a list of movies where these are from so we can play along at home?  Oh, right.  So just list them really fast.  I said it's Goodfellas.  A lot of them are Goodfellas.  Godfather.  Clockwork Orange.  Godfather 2 more than Godfather 1. 
[01:09:30]  That was both of them.  Both of them.  Clockwork Orange.  The Shining.  Shining is huge.  Cuckoo's Nest.  I love tossing in Cuckoo's Nest.  Always a problem.  Full Metal Jacket.  Always.  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember.  We said Goodfellas.  Casino.  Yeah.  A little casino.  That's the majority of them.  Those are the ones.  I think that was the list they gave the guy.  We don't stray from our list very much.  Nah.  JFK.  Oh, my God, yeah.  You haven't really done a lot of the JFK.  So what do you think with this situation?  It looks really bad.  I mean, really bad. 
[01:10:00]  Bob is frustrated with this.  It's hilarious.  And if Bob is frustrated with it, that means it's gotten to the point where it's gotten further  than it should have gotten.  And you know something?  You've got to nip it.  He's got to do something.  But, yeah, he's in a rough situation because, first of all, he's not a tough guy.  He's a tough negotiator.  Maybe he can negotiate a deal with the guy.  You don't understand.  10% of his wife.  Something like that.  I can see that up there, Bob, figuring something like that out.  Well, Bob, you don't understand.  It's like you don't need violence.  I mean, you know, Bob with his pen could do more than 10,000 men with guns. 
[01:10:30]  You know, I mean, Bob has a lot of power as an attorney.  Just hire someone to kill the guy, Bob.  There you go.  Hire some guy to just smash his feet with a bat.  All right, let's say something.  He's got to tell his wife.  He has.  He's got to say, look.  I've seen him say it to her.  No, no, I mean serious.  He's got to say, look, this stops.  This stops.  I'm going to get you a new cell phone.  You change the number.  And this guy gets this number again.  And, you know, there's going to be a big, big problem. 
[01:11:00]  Big problem.  Hey, John, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  You got the same problem?  Yeah, well, you know what it is?  You know, I've been listening to you guys for a long time.  I'm originally from Long Island.  I used to live around the corner from Bob Buckman.  Hey, that's great.  The cue of the day.  Hey, that's great.  Well, you know what it is?  It really sucks because, you know, I moved out to PA and I'm a truck driver and I'm gone like every other day.  All right?  And my wife became friends with this guy and every time, man, you fuck up, it's like he's near the comforter. 
[01:11:30]  Right.  You know, and it blows.  And I tried everything.  And this guy, he calls the house once more.  I pick up the phone.  He hangs up the phone.  He's scared of me.  That's creepy.  And it is.  And, you know, I want to kick the living shit out of him.  All right?  And, you know, he runs scared for me.  And, you know, it's the same thing.  You know, so you don't dare fuck up because you know he's just in the aisles waiting for you.  What would your wife or what would someone's girlfriend do if all of a sudden every night you're carrying on a conversation with a girl online and you're, you know, getting this little relationship where she's calling you on the phone, you're talking. 
[01:12:00]  And then you tell the wife, oh, you're just friends.  You think any wife or girlfriend would stand by for that crap?  Of course not.  No, no way in hell, man.  They're hanging out to dry, man.  The first thing they'll do is screw you over.  Oh, because you're just looking to get laid.  But, you know, I'm just sitting here and I'm in this relationship.  Online, but it's not going to go any further than that.  But stop it.  Oh, yeah.  It's always progressing, moving forward up to the point where the guy wants to take it, which is sinking it deep in your loved one. 
[01:12:30]  And let me tell you something.  Women are more capable of being friends because a lot, especially when they're married with kids, because a lot of times they don't get out of the house that much.  They're kind of bored.  So they have fun online, chitting and chatting.  A little chit chat.  I've talked to a lot of married women, and to be honest with you, most of them, 80% to 90% of them just want to be friendly, and they don't want to take it anywhere.  Once in a while, you'll get lucky and pick one off, but normally they just want to be friendly.  And I'm the dirtbag at home with my pants, you know, I'm whacking my bag trying to get something dirty started. 
[01:13:00]  I see what you mean, but you know something?  It only takes one guy to break through that barrier, be a little smooth, and it's over.  I'm crass and obvious.  Yeah.  You walk crass and obvious.  I try to put LOL at the end of it, but it doesn't, you know, so you want to take a dump on my chest, LOL.  You know, just kidding, having fun.  R-O-F-L-O.  R-O-A-F.  Rolling all over the floor.  I only want to hear that if you're a burn victim. 
[01:13:30]  All right.  Thank you, John.  Let's go to Lobster, another trucker checking in today.  Hey, Lobster, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Here, I'll give you the horn.  There you go.  Listen.  Your horn's a little weak.  Yeah.  Oh, hey, look, what can I say?  I'll open the window a little better for you here.  All right.  That's a loud one.  Listen, I was living in New York City at the time, and I got on a chat room, and I met this  chick down in Delaware.  Her husband was a trucker, and he was gone.  I worked local, and he was gone, you know, out all the time, and she started confiding 
[01:14:00]  in me, four kids, the whole nine yards, married ten years, slamming body, 38 double Ds, 32,  36, unbelievable, five foot eight, dark brown hair, doe eyes, beautiful.  She runs the show for her husband.  I mean, she totally dominates this guy.  Well, she's complaining about him.  Well, let me tell you, this chick is into everything, totally freaky. 
[01:14:30]  I mean, I've introduced her to fisting, domination.  Fisting?  How do you introduce someone to fisting?  How do you introduce someone to fisting?  Yeah, what do you do?  Put on Caligula and go, you know?  Pull out the lard.  My God, she is just, she is a kinky dream come true.  She's totally into being dominated.  Tie her up.  She has to be tied up when I fist her.  She just loves it.  Well, they all do, yes.  Oh, she thrashes around. 
[01:15:00]  I've even done double anal fisting with her.  I mean, just totally over the top.  Shake hands with yourself.  Wait a minute.  Hey, pleased to meet you.  Wait, double anal fisting?  I swear to God, two fists in the anal cavity.  Two in the, and then you know what you do?  You try to clap.  Hey.  And then you say, hey, I can't clap.  And she goes, tight, huh?  Oh, I tell you.  Hey, I had a refurbisher.  I put in a 20-pound ham and pulled out the bone.  Lovely. 
[01:15:30]  Bump, bump.  Oh, it's just unbelievable.  So, listen, guys.  Yeah.  I'm warning you, man.  If you're in that kind of relationship, that shit is happening.  All right.  And listen, I work down in Florida right now.  I drive a cement bulk hauler.  I got wow written on all the mudflaps.  Oh, thank you.  I go through Gainesville, Florida.  I run a dedicated route between Tampa and Gainesville.  And that's the college town, Florida Gators.  I have had a couple of those wonderful, lovely, perky college flashes at me. 
[01:16:00]  Very nice.  The girls are definitely out there ready to flash you if you have wow in your car.  I'm telling you, it works like a charm.  Don't the truckers tend to be chatty Cathy's?  What else they got?  They're lonely out there.  I understand.  All right, Lobster.  Thank you.  Bye, fella.  Hey, have a good one, guys.  I can't believe you put both claws in her little backside.  Double anal fisting.  Little rubber bands around his hand.  Oh, little Lobster.  Little rubber band. 
[01:16:30]  I didn't know that was possible.  Oh, yeah, it is.  I hurt.  Fisting to me is disgusting and violating.  Oh, we found your limit, huh?  Does nothing.  I don't like anything inserted into a woman.  I'm a pervert, but it's got to be organic.  I don't like dildos and toys.  Beat it with that crap.  No?  No.  Put this in.  For what?  What is that doing for me?  Exactly.  Yeah, it's part of your self-centeredness.  You think it would just have to be you in there.  But no, I mean, no, not at all. 
[01:17:00]  I know I'm kind of inept, but it's not about just, you know, using the vagina as an object  holder.  It's not a pencil holder.  I'd rather lick it.  I mean, it's not about me.  I'm in there.  Believe me, I'm a good egg, but I don't like putting stuff in there in a fist.  It's so weird where his lines are, but it really is.  Okay, let's say hi to Dale, another trucker.  A lot of truckers checking in today.  Of course.  Very early.  Hey.  Hey, how are you doing?  Pretty good, man.  You had the same issue as our agent?  Oh, shit, yeah.  I mean, when I woke up, I just woke up with your radio station, and I'm sitting there, 
[01:17:30]  and the next thing I hear is a story, and I had a flashback.  This shit happened to me exactly.  Really?  Let me tell you something.  If he thinks it's going on, it's going on.  I was married for four months, and my ex, man, she was doing a phone deal and everything.  We went out to New York City.  We're from Indiana.  We went out to New York City for Christmas last year. 
[01:18:00]  All the way out there and all the way back.  Her cell phone was ringing, and guess what?  It was old Bob.  That's who it was.  Huh.  I don't think, but I'm going to disagree with one thing.  Just because you think she's doing it, she's doing it.  Not necessarily true, because his wife is not cheating on him.  I don't think she's cheating on him at all.  I have to say that, because we probably shouldn't even have brought this story up.  I just know that it's just a flirtatious thing that's driving Bob nuts, and they're trying 
[01:18:30]  to figure out how to make this guy go away.  Close enough, and there's no upside to it.  It can't end good.  But she's asked him to don't email me anymore.  Like, please don't email me anymore.  I'm uncomfortable with your compliments.  You know something?  If she did that, then fine.  Let him email.  Delete, delete, delete.  Never answer again.  Change your phone number.  Don't answer the cell phone.  Change your phone.  I don't understand.  Hey, mine said the same thing.  She said that, well, I asked them to quit doing this, and I asked them to quit doing  that, and then, you know, something just happened. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, I asked them.  You know, whatever.  And where did this guy come from?  How did she meet him?  How did mine meet him?  Yeah, how did...  He was the manager in the store where she used to work at.  Oh.  There you go.  At the Walmart?  No, at a truck stop.  Oh, that's on my tab.  Oh, boy.  So what happened, the only thing that's suspicious, though, is like every time the guy would call  the house, she would say to Bob, Bob, could you leave?  Oh.  She would ask him to go into the room so she could talk, but that's... 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  But that's nothing.  No.  Let's calm down now.  Eric from Nebraska, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, man.  When my wife and I have been married eight years, and she caught me on AOL right after  we got married, chatting with some woman, and she turned around and started doing the  same damn thing with some guy.  Well, it was your fault.  You started it.  Good for the goose is good for the gander.  Oh, yeah.  But she caught me red-handed doing it.  She tried being sneaky with me, and I installed spyware software where I could keep an eye on 
[01:20:00]  what she was doing.  Yep.  And so I caught her, and the conversation started getting real racy, like, you know,  the guy wanted to meet her, and my wife was real sweet and innocent and all this shit,  and a friend of mine told me one day, he said, yeah, there was some strange guy over at your  house, or over at your apartment, when one of my buddies lived a couple houses down, or  a couple doors down from us.  He goes, yeah, there was some guy over there the other day.  That's all.  I don't know who the fuck he was.  So I turned around and set up two hidden video cameras in our apartment. 
[01:20:30]  I don't know if I still have the tape.  I told your screener, I'll look and see if I still do.  But, man, my sweet and innocent wife, he told me she'd never cheat on me.  You got video of her?  What was she doing in the video?  Oh, just about anything that she wouldn't do with me, that's for damn sure.  Here he is.  Here's the guy watching the video.  Yeah, I just, you know.  Turn it off! 
[01:21:00]  Oh, no, okay, no, that was a tape of me last night watching the Yankee game.  Oh, sorry, sorry, I got confused.  Thank you, Eric.  Yeah.  All right.  You know, I hate that online thing.  I was online, I was trying to pick up what I thought was a cop once.  Turned out to be a 13-year-old girl when I went to meet her. 
[01:21:30]  Isn't that horrible?  I hate when that happens.  So deceiving.  Alabama trucker checking in.  It's Colt 4-5.  What's up, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I'm cruising through this fuckhole state of Alabama.  I love these truckers, man.  Oh, shit.  Hang in there.  So what do you got today?  It's all foggy and shitty out.  It's Alabama.  Yeah.  That's a sunny day in Alabama.  Yeah.  Are you kidding? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  All right.  What do you got, bro?  Those truck drivers who called in earlier, fucking another truck driver's wife while he's out.  Yeah.  They're called Jody's, man.  Jody's?  Yeah.  That's what we call him out here is a Jody.  A Jody.  The guy, as soon as he leaves the house, he's over pumping chalk and your wife is as hard as he can do it.  Wow.  Fucking slime bag.  You know what? 
[01:22:30]  I'm starting to think that there's not many truckers out there in a happy relationship.  I know.  There's all sorts of crap going on when they're on the road.  They're getting hemorrhoids from bouncing all over the highway and their awful wives are giving a box to some creep in the neighborhood.  Don't blame them.  All right.  There's a couple more.  The phones have exploded.  We want to move on to a couple things here, but Ryan in Chicago.  Hey.  Hey.  How's it going, guys?  Pretty good, bro.  Kind of had the same thing happen to me a year ago.  My wife kicked me out, and I'm a trucker, and I moved in with my best friend. 
[01:23:00]  He kept going down there telling me he's just being friends with her, found out he's fucking her in my house while I was sleeping on his couch in his apartment.  Wow.  Wow.  Oh, Jesus.  That's low.  Now the two of them are living together.  The best thing is I got the house and everything out of the whole deal.  Did you beat him up, though?  Come close a few times.  Every time I go near their house, they call the cops on me for something stupid.  Yeah, because it's your problem.  Yeah, I've got the problem, and he's the low life that snuck in and banged my old lady in my bed. 
[01:23:30]  Well, what did you think, though, like when you were on his couch?  What did he say?  I'll go talk to her, and I'll be back?  Well, how would it happen that he would just wind up there and tell you about it?  No, he'd tell me he was going to somewhere else to see some other girl.  I went down to my house one day, and he's sitting in my kitchen cooking dinner for my wife and kids.  I drug him out of the house, and the low life bastard wouldn't raise his hands.  I threw him all over the yard, and he wouldn't do nothing.  Just one man tossing another man around the yard?  I like that.  Smell your wife on his penis? 
[01:24:00]  Did they take it in a hot tub together?  He didn't want to punch you because he didn't want his hands to swell because he wanted to fist your wife.  Oh, Jesus.  That's okay.  You can have the fat skank whore anyway.  Hey, there you go.  That's right.  Move on to another one, sir.  Thank God you went with that with me, sir.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, that was awkward for all of us.  I wasn't that brave to go with that, but thank you for helping me out.  Guys, opening his heart up, and you're doing a fisting reference.  I know.  You didn't want swollen fists?  All right.  Two more, and we'll move on? 
[01:24:30]  Okay.  Let's another trucker in PA.  It's Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Let me hear the horn quick.  There you go.  All right.  Hey, I fucked my ex-old lady more now than I did when I was married.  Really?  That's an odd thing, man.  That is an odd thing when I hear this.  She just got remarried back in July.  That's the best part.  She's remarried, and you're still banging her?  Oh, yeah.  The new husband works middle shift, so he ain't never home at night.  Every time I bring my son home, she puts him in bed, and we just go to town. 
[01:25:00]  Wow.  See?  They're all pigs.  These people are all just disgusting to everybody.  Everyone just wants to get laid.  We all make believe we don't want to.  Yes, mister.  Oh!  Bravo!  You got it!  Bravo!  He nailed you!  You ate it!  It's like you were his ex-wife, the way he just banged you.  You have to be tired today.  I am tired.  God damn it.  Wow.  That rarely happens right there. 
[01:25:30]  He got me good.  Oof.  Oh, boy.  I poked my fat face right out.  Can I help you?  Hello?  Yes.  Yes, sir?  Yes, sir?  Wait, he's still there?  Hello?  Richie?  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  I was at a wedding.  My wife has a lot of clients, and there was this one lawyer guy who kept calling all the  time, email and everything.  So we're all sitting at the wedding table, and we're getting a little drunk.  He says, you know, I never want you to think that there's anything going on with my  wife.  So, you know, everything's quiet, because people are talking and shit. 
[01:26:00]  And I said, if anything was ever going on with my wife, I'd just beat the fucking balls  off of you.  The whole wedding goes dead quiet.  Fucking very uncomfortable situation.  Was anything going on?  I never heard from the guy again.  What was going on with this guy, though?  Hey, I think he was trying to strike up something with my wife, but then once I confronted him,  he just disappeared.  You're not a lawyer, right?  No, no, no.  I'm a construction worker.  Yeah, definitely.  That's Trump's lawyer, definitely, when it comes to the fisticuffs. 
[01:26:30]  All right.  These stories are starting to get better and better.  Should we take a break?  Should we continue?  What do you want to do?  Well, I can tell you the one time that I had a girlfriend years ago, and she shaved  her pubic hair really nice and short, which was so hot, and then I wound up getting crabs  like three days later, and I realized why that awful creep had shaved her pub short, because  she caught crabs banging somebody, and then gave them to me.  And I knew, because I didn't cheat on her at that point.  Yeah.  So I get crabs from a girl.  So if you ever wonder why I'm a dirtbag, believe me, I've been warned. 
[01:27:00]  Crabs.  I've never gotten crabs.  Three times I've had them.  Of course you have.  Of course you have.  How could you not?  Because I'm, well, crabs you can get even with a bag.  I mean, you know, you can get them.  Of course.  Those little fellas just jump on and welcome.  Little guys.  Little guys.  Snapping their little claws, holding on tight to a hair.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Well, that time I got them from the girlfriend, and the first two times I got them was like  within a five-day period when I was 19 from the same chick twice. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, wow.  And I knew she had them, and I banged her anyway.  What a filthy stank whore.  Yeah, I banged her anyway.  I knew she had them.  Nice.  Here's the deal.  We got a lot of people calling in, and the stories are getting better.  So we got to take leaks and stuff.  So we'll step aside, right?  Sure.  And then we'll continue this.  Also, Anthony, on the way, breaking out our new game, Coming or Going.  Coming or Going.  I love it.  And we're wondering if another couple is going to attempt to become the sexiest state in America  today.  You never know when that pops up.  You just don't know.  So far, Illinois is very, very sexy. 
[01:28:00]  Very sexy, yes.  With the girl that was gagging a little bit yesterday for all of us.  Yeah.  As we go to break, one of our favorite games we used to play when you were allowed to  do prank phone calls was Hi, Mom.  Yeah.  You've heard Hi, Mom, I'm in jail, I think, by now.  Hi, Mom, I'm in porno.  Remember Hi, Mom, I got fired for masturbating?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We couldn't play this on the radio anymore because you couldn't say masturbate or something  like that, right?  Yeah.  So check this out as we go to break, and we'll continue. 
[01:28:30]  Hey, Chad.  Hey, what's up?  I hear you want to play Hi, Mom, I got fired for masturbating.  Yes, I do.  Is she going to buy this?  My mom's really gullible.  Hold on the line.  It's ringing, bro.  Good luck.  Hello?  Mom?  Yeah?  Can you pick me up from work?  How come I can't hear you?  Can you pick me up from work?  Yeah.  I got fired.  What?  I got fired from work today.  Can you pick me up?  No way. 
[01:29:00]  Please, pick me up.  What the heck happened?  It's kind of embarrassing.  What are you going to tell me?  I was in the stock room, and someone walked in on me when I was masturbating.  What?  I got caught masturbating in the stock room.  They're going to have to pick me up.  They're going to have to sign you up in there.  What are you, nuts?  Just come pick me up, will you, Mom?  Chad, you're supposed to do stuff like that in the privacy of your own home. 
[01:29:30]  I know.  It's embarrassing, Mom.  I don't...  So where are you?  At a pay phone or something?  No, I'm at work, and, you know, I'm here.  Everyone's been looking at me and laughing at me and stuff.  It's just...  Just come pick me up, will you, please?  All right, all right.  Want me to meet you out back?  Yeah, just pick me up where you dropped me off this morning.  All right.  You okay?  Well, besides my pride, I'm embarrassed.  Just pick me up as soon as you get a chance.  All right.  Thanks.  All right.  I'll be there.  Bye.  Bye. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, my God, dude.  What the hell's wrong with you?  How was that?  That was awesome, actually.  She got me pissed now.  Wow, I can't believe you said that to your own mother.  Come on!  Woo!  Check this out!  Rock!  I kick it!  In the hizzy!  I kick it old-school-y!  Duh!  Hey, jerk-face!  Hey, jerk-face!  You feel me?  Waka-waka-waka!  Smoke that bitch!  How much ass does that kick? 
[01:30:30]  Sexy!  How much ass does that kick?  Sexy!  East side!  Booty!  Let's do it!  Booty!  Booty!  These boobs rock!  Yachts!  Is anyone menstruated?  My nipples are hard just thinking about it.  Has everybody gone crazy?  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  I saw this wino.  He was eating grapes.  He's like, dude, you have to wait.  I like to drink red wine. 
[01:31:00]  This girl says, doesn't red wine give you a headache?  Yeah, eventually.  But the first and the middle part are amazing.  I'm not going to stop doing something because of what happens at the end.  Mitch, do you want an apple?  No, eventually it'll be a core.  I went to the store, bought eight apples.  The clerk said, do you want me to put them in a bag?  I said, oh no, man, I juggle.  But I can only juggle eight.  If I'm ever here to buy nine apples, fucking bag them up.  I saw a guy juggling chainsaws. 
[01:31:30]  It was cool, but unless something needed to be sawed down, then it's just annoying.  It's like, come on, Rick, can we use one?  Track number five will not be Chainsaw Juggling.  It will be this one.  I was going to have my teeth whitened, but then I said, fuck that.  I'll just get a tan instead.  I got some tartar-controlled toothpaste. 
[01:32:00]  I still got tartar, but that shit's under control.  If the tartar gets out of line, I'm like, come on, man, you know the deal.  Fall in.  You crazy-ass tartar.  I got so much tartar, I don't have to dip my fish sticks in shit.  That's actually kind of gross, you know. 
[01:32:30]  After that joke, I always clarify that I'm just joking.  I don't know how much tartar I actually had.  I believe it's the average amount.  If we all did a tartar test right now, my name would be right in the fucking middle.  I would like to go fishing and catch a fish stick.  That would be convenient.  I could easily get a job with Mrs. Paul's. 
[01:33:00]  They'd just put me in a boat with some empty boxes.  And I would return them to the freezer section of your neighborhood grocery store.  The owner is a fishing show on TV.  They catch the fish, but they let it go.  They don't want to eat the fish, but they do want to make it late for something.  Where were you?  I got caught.  Bullshit.  Let me see the inside of your lip. 
[01:33:30]  Fish are always eating other fish.  If fish could scream, the ocean would be loud as shit.  You would not want to submerge your head.  Nothing but fish going, ah, fuck.  I thought I looked like that rock.  Coming up next on Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton sings. 
[01:34:00]  Forget me not.  You're sightless caught.  Your dog's just shit on my rug.  I thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?  How's that for a sketch?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You don't do sketches, stupid.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America on XM Satellite Radio. 
[01:34:30]  A big hi to everyone that turned on their radios overnight, Anthony.  Yes, yes.  Man, the audience growing every single day.  It's very, very cool to see.  Ben is laughing.  Why?  Ben is laughing just listening during the little breaks.  Me and Jim commiserating.  Me and Jim just commiserating and Ben going, ha, ha.  Well, because it's always been me that's had to deal with this.  That's true.  It's kind of nice for once.  I'll bask in it.  I hope you enjoy it.  And actually, you know, you guys are being, you're not being the usual arrogant Yankee fans  as most of them are.  Well, we're not making excuses for their loss.  Like, whoa, it was this one. 
[01:35:00]  They just got their asses whipped.  It's just irritating to have lost four straight.  I wouldn't even take the loss.  Like, ah, you lost.  But just to have done it like that.  I know.  It was just a choke, and it was awful.  That's the irritating part.  All right.  Who was the intern that brought in the Oompa Loompa shirts again?  Danny.  Danny.  I like that kid.  Danny's great.  This intern, he made Oompa Loompa t-shirts for the whole staff.  Now winning that Oompa Loompa shirt tournament, that's what you need.  I think he's trying to kiss our butt a little bit.  But you know what?  He did a good job because these shirts are great.  I like them.  He handed out Oompa Loompa shirts to all of us. 
[01:35:30]  And, you know, then we felt guilty because he's just an intern.  You don't make much money in your regular life, right?  What regular life?  Really?  You don't even have a job?  No, dude.  Just this.  This is it?  This is it.  How do you support yourself?  I don't.  Live at home?  Oh, yeah.  There's the fact that you look a little like Sully's retarded brother.  From Godsmack?  Yeah.  He looks a little like Sully.  There's a little Sully thing going on.  They're going to get Sully on hopefully tomorrow from Godsmack.  Our first big guest, I think.  Mm-hmm.  So, yeah.  He made the Oompa Loompa t-shirts. 
[01:36:00]  And then we felt bad because the guy, you know, doesn't have any money.  So instead of breaking open our wallets, we're like, we got a good idea.  We felt bad, but not that bad.  Yeah.  So we signed an Oompa Loompa shirt, and we're going to put it on eBay so the guy can make  some of his money back.  This is a one-of-a-kind item.  That's right.  One-of-a-kind Oompa Loompa shirt.  Is it going to be online soon?  Yeah.  Probably in about 15 minutes.  Probably in 15 minutes.  You go to eBay.com, obviously.  We just signed it.  In the search there, and you'll see the Oompa Loompa t-shirt signed by myself, Anthony, 
[01:36:30]  and Norton.  There you go.  And he'll get any of the proceeds, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  We got to go back to the phones.  We got a few more cheater stories on the phones.  And then we're going to play, finally, Coming or Going, Anthony.  Coming or Going.  We're going to move on with the program.  But this seems to be what they call a hot topic.  It's a hot topic today on the Opie and Anthony show.  And if I could get the phones.  Okay.  George in Colorado.  Let's go. 
[01:37:00]  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  I walked in and caught my wife banging some guy she met online.  Oh.  Come on.  No, I'm serious.  Wait.  What was the situation?  How did you come home early or what?  Well, like most of the other callers, I'm a truck driver.  And I had taken a run.  It was supposed to be five days.  And it got cut short.  And I came back two days early.  Ooh.  And I came home.  And there was another car parked in the driveway.  And I didn't know whose car it was.  And, you know, I wasn't thinking anything.  I thought the car looked similar to one of my wife's girlfriend's cars. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, no.  And, you know, I thought maybe she had, you know, one of her friends was over.  Yeah.  Well, it was.  Yeah, I was.  A good friend.  Yeah.  You know, it was kind of a shocker there.  I come walking up, open the door.  And usually the dog greets me at the door.  She had locked the dog out back.  And the dog wouldn't bother him.  And I come walking in.  I'm like, what the fuck?  And I heard something.  I go walking upstairs.  And there they are going at it.  And I was like, what the fuck?  Wow. 
[01:38:00]  What did you do?  Beat the shit out of the guy.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Because it turned.  Well, you know, she started pleading with, you know, I mean, I come walking in.  I was pissed.  And I was ready to go after the two of them.  And she jumped in the bathroom and slammed the door and locked it.  So I couldn't get to her.  And the guy's like, hey, she, you know, she encouraged me.  She encouraged me.  She encouraged me.  And I said, man, I don't give a fuck what she did.  Yeah, right?  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He just, I mean, literally, he ran down the steps, fuck naked, me chasing after him. 
[01:38:30]  When he hit the front door, the front door didn't open.  It's what he wanted.  And the two of us went through the front, through a, we have a full length, we had a full length  glass storm door.  And I hit him.  The two of us went through the door.  And I proceeded to beat the shit out of him on the front lawn.  I think if the neighbors see a guy beating up a naked guy on the front lawn,  you don't even have to wonder what happened.  You don't have to ask or anything.  There's no doubt there.  You can just whack your bag and watch. 
[01:39:00]  So one of my neighbors, one of my neighbors saw me beating a guy, called the cops, the  cops showed up.  And the first thing the cops said to the guy, I mean, I got charged with battery, but the  the first thing the cops said to the guy was, so, was his wife worth it?  Yeah.  Wow.  And the guy just, you know, he just, you know.  Was he a friend of yours or you didn't know him, right?  No, I didn't know him.  She had met him, she had been, she had met him online.  I mean, it was kind of a fluke.  She hated, you know, I mean, we'd had the computer for several years and she'd never really 
[01:39:30]  gotten online, she just, you know, thought it was a waste of time and it was just, it  was, we literally in counseling talked about it and I learned how it happened is it was  kind of a fluke.  How did people meet before computers?  How did they hook up before computers?  I don't know.  Single bars.  Single bars.  Yeah.  You stayed married?  Yeah, we stayed married.  We worked it out.  It's just, you know, I mean, I wonder sometimes, I mean, I still drive trucks, but man, I work 
[01:40:00]  for a different company to where the most I'm gone is, is the same day and I know her  work schedule.  That means you really didn't work it out, sir.  You are still with her.  Oh, wow.  You didn't really work it out because there's just no trust in that relationship anymore.  Well, I mean, it's coming, it's coming back, but it's, you know.  What position were they in when you, uh.  He was on top.  Just, just nailing her?  Just dominating?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, I mean, she told, she just, I moved out. 
[01:40:30]  In fact, I lived out of the truck for about a month until we, you know, it took a, I mean,  she was calling my cell phone every fucking day wanting to talk to me and, and as soon  as I'd see the numbers, I, I would just hang up and it, it took about a month before I finally  talked to her and we, we went to counseling, but it was like, man, I, when, when she, when  she admitted to me how it happened, uh, there'll, there'll, there'll never be another computer  in my house.  Yeah.  It was the computer.  Did she, let me ask you a question.  Like, but do you think beforehand, did they just start like that or do you think like 
[01:41:00]  there was other stuff that they did before it like that?  Or did you catch it in the beginning?  That was, that was the first time.  That was the first time.  She was.  Oh, I'm sure it was.  They, well, they had been, they had been chatting online for like three weeks and she said they'd  gone to lunch once and that was, you know, and, and she had told the guy like twice,  you know, no, no, no, no, she didn't want it to go any farther and, and whatnot.  And he just kind of, uh, he, he was kind of putting it, you know, pushing himself on 
[01:41:30]  her a little bit.  And, and it finally got to the point where she figured, well, maybe if she did it once  he'd, he'd go away.  And you believe that story?  Well, my, I know you, my wife, yeah.  I mean, you talk about, uh, your agent's wife being naive, uh, let me tell you something.  I've, I, I've come home from work and told my wife shit that she just, she bought hook,  line, and sinker.  I, I mean, I, I've gone out to strip clubs with guys from work blowing a whole, blowing  a whole $700 paycheck in one night. 
[01:42:00]  And I get paid 700 bucks a week on, or better on average.  And I mean, I've blown a whole paycheck in one night at a strip club.  I came home and told my wife that I lost it in a poker game.  And she doesn't even wonder about, uh, you know, a lipstick mark on my collar.  Of course, she's not going to call you out on anything.  Yeah, she's just direct attention away from me.  She's just thanking God that you haven't caught on to what she's doing.  Right.  All right.  Well, and this was, this was before she had done this.  I mean, I, I would do shit like that.  And she didn't know, you know, she's. 
[01:42:30]  All right.  Maybe that's why she was doing these things.  George, I got to cut you off because a lot of people aren't in on this and we really want  to move on to our coming or going game.  Bye, George.  Thank you very much for sharing with the audience.  Let's say hi to Scott in New Jersey.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  Hey, Owen.  Hey, what's going on?  Come on.  All right.  This story.  My wife used to work at this place.  Okay.  A guy was hitting on her all the time.  She moved, you know, went to a different place to work.  This guy kept calling her, emailing her.  So what I did one night, it was like February.  It gets dark around five o'clock. 
[01:43:00]  I slim jimmed the back of his car door, waited in the back.  The guy got into his car.  I grabbed her on the neck.  Said, you go near my wife again, I'll fucking kill you.  Hey, there you go.  Never had a problem with him again.  That does tend to solve things.  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  You took the initiative.  All right.  I got punched in the face by a husband one time.  I told her this story.  You did?  And I told her this story?  No, I never heard that.  When I was like 18 or 19.  Really?  What were you doing?  I was seeing this woman.  She was married, but she was separated. 
[01:43:30]  And her husband at the time.  That's a tricky time, though.  Yeah, he was living with another girl.  I mean, looking back, I shouldn't have done it.  But it was like I thought he had moved on.  And she lived right on the Jersey-Pennsylvania border, actually, in Pennsylvania.  And she lived over a bar.  So I would go over there once in a while.  Again, I was 19.  And we're fooling around one night.  Teen gym story.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I think this is a hot teen.  Hold on. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, it's a hot teen gym story.  As you know by now, the timing on the show, we need to work on that.  But this is hot teen news.  Opie and Anthony's hot teen news.  Yes, Jim.  Well, you were how old?  19.  Yeah.  19.  And I was, I was, it was funny.  We started out as friends.  And I remember, like, before anything ever happened, this is how naive I was.  She was hugging me one time.  Yeah.  And she was wearing sweatpants. 
[01:44:30]  And I caught a full rod.  And she kept trying to position herself to kind of press against it.  Oh.  And I was embarrassed, so I kept turning away so she wouldn't feel it.  Oh, no.  Yeah, I was a dumbbell.  Yeah, that's pretty stupid.  So we developed this thing.  We started fooling around.  And one night, I mean, her husband was a psychopath.  He was, like, fighting cops and getting arrested for punching police.  He was a kook.  So one night, we're fooling around.  And she looked over a bar.  And I hear this.  The knock at the door. 
[01:45:00]  Well, I'm thinking, why is somebody taking a broom handle and knocking on the ceiling from the bottom?  Someone's going, hey.  Right.  Turns out, that was the sound of cowboy boots walking across the wood floor approaching us.  Because I'm fooling around with her.  And the only light is the TV light.  And she's on her back.  And she looks up and she goes, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  No way.  I feel two hands on my back.  I don't know what's happening.  All of a sudden.  Hey, a threesome.  Yeah.  Hey, don't push, fella. 
[01:45:30]  And he belts me in the face twice.  I mean, before I know it, I'm on the floor.  One of my contacts falls out.  I'm just kind of like looking around.  He turns the light on.  And he's standing there.  He's like 6'3".  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  And I'm on the floor.  And he's standing there huffing and puffing.  And he was like trying to clean up his drug addiction.  Oh, great.  But he's telling his wife that he had gone out and used cocaine that night.  Ah, that's what you want. 
[01:46:00]  And he's talking about me like I'm not even there.  And he's like, you know I'm going to kill him, don't you?  You know that has to happen.  I mean, and he was a psychopath.  And I had met him before.  You know I have to kill him.  And I had met him before.  And I didn't like make the connection as to who he was to her.  Like I met him through somebody else at one point.  And I had been nice to him.  And that was the only thing that saved me.  Because he was really going to murder me.  Not like in a beat you up way.  But you know, like I'm going to end your life. 
[01:46:30]  Kill you.  Yeah, like grab a kitchen knife and stick it in my fat stomach.  And I was just kind of kneeling there horrified.  I did nothing.  Because I'm like, he wasn't doing it.  Once he punched me twice and I saw stars.  Were you nude?  No, no, no.  If I was, he would have killed me.  Yeah.  But you were on top of her.  Kissing.  Oh, okay, okay.  She had on like a negligee or whatever.  And I was lamely trying to paw at her.  Oh, that's hot.  That is so hot.  How old was she?  She was probably 27.  But as he's walking me to the door.  He had to calm down.  She calmed him down. 
[01:47:00]  And he's going to let me go.  He's like, all right, whatever.  You didn't know she was my wife.  Because I didn't.  I had met him that one time.  And he's like, look, I know you knew she was my wife.  Just tell me.  This is how she's walking me to the door.  Just tell me you knew she was my wife.  And I'm going to let you go.  Oh, boy.  That sounds like one of those set up things.  He's like, but if you don't admit that to me, I'm going to kill you.  But that sounds like one of those things that if you do fess up to it, then he kills you.  Of course it was.  But I couldn't have fessed up to him.  I'm like, well, you're going to have to kill me, man, because I didn't know.  Oh, good.  Believe me, it was the last.  You think Michael Corleone didn't have shit on me. 
[01:47:30]  I was deadpan and powerful.  And he's like, all right, all right.  And he opens the door and he lets me go.  He was waiting for you to say, all right.  No, okay.  Yeah, I kind of knew.  And then wham, you'd have been all over.  I would have been thrown through the window.  How bad was the punching?  Did he break anything?  I didn't.  No, no, no, no, no.  It's all white.  You really do see stars.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's cliche.  Look, there's Ernest Borgnine.  But I'm almost glad I didn't see him coming.  Because obviously, I mean, it's not that I'm a tough guy.  But if you see a man walking out, you stand. 
[01:48:00]  I mean, you're not going to lay there on his wife.  Right.  And had I done that or taken that defensive position, he probably would have picked up a chair and cracked it across my head.  Uh-huh.  But she said, like, she told me I talked to her weeks later.  And she said the one reason.  You talked to her?  Well, I wouldn't even have.  If I saw her coming, I'd have run away screaming.  She called to apologize.  It was done.  And she's like, I'm sorry, whatever.  But she's like, the only reason that he didn't murder you was because you just kind of let it mellow out.  You let it diffuse.  And he was all coked up.  But he's not a – he's a psycho, but he's not a bully. 
[01:48:30]  So, like, he likes to fight, like, groups of guys.  And because I was small, you know what I mean?  Had I jumped up, he would have murdered me.  But because I just kind of sat there with no contact lens.  Sounds like how you have to deal with a bear that's mauling you.  But he was right.  Now what you got to do is lay there.  I was looking for a hill to run down.  Pretend you're dead.  Yeah, pretend you're dead.  Lay dead.  He'll sniff you a little.  Right.  I didn't think he'd smell it because I hung my condoms in a tree.  That is horrible. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  Scary story.  Although I wasn't really in the wrong.  Wife fucker.  You should have killed you.  I never banged her.  No, we never banged.  Oh, you didn't.  Okay.  No.  All right.  This is the last one, and then we got to move on.  It's Mark from Kentucky.  Hey, Mark.  Hey, guys.  How y'all doing?  Good.  Great.  I got a story for you about that wife cheating on you with the internet thing.  Okay.  I had caught my wife.  I got nosing on the internet there on her email and started checking out and noticing  something was going on, and I didn't know really what to do, so I just kept watching them.  And then I got that final email where they said they were going to meet. 
[01:49:30]  And I'm a truck driver, all right?  So I told them to make sure my wife knew I was out of town, in a truck, driving, but I wasn't.  And I was home.  Oh, the setup.  They were posting me at a Sears parking lot, 2 o'clock in the morning.  Yeah.  I took my truck over there early.  I sat over by where there were no lights, over by the maintenance bay, where they work  on cars, and I waited.  Lights off, truck running, smoking my little cigarettes, waiting.  And there they show up.  Now, my wife got out of our car that I bought, that I paid for, but she fucking drives, and 
[01:50:00]  they got into his car.  And, of course, the car started rocking and moving and everything.  You pretty much know what's going on.  They were listening to music?  Yeah.  No, I didn't have nothing going on in the truck but cigarettes.  Windows all fogged up?  Oh, yeah.  The whole nine yards.  And after they got done with their business, about 45 minutes, I sat there, they got out  of the car, they kissed each other, I started catching gears. 
[01:50:30]  Wait a minute.  You allowed them to finish?  Yeah.  I sat there and waited.  Did you whack your bag at all?  No, I didn't.  I was kind of out of it at the time.  I just couldn't believe it.  I can't understand that you would let them finish.  And when I started catching gears, the noise, they heard it.  They turned around and looked.  By then, I hit seventh gear, flipped my lights on.  And even though I lost my job at the time and had to get lawyers to get my license back,  I plowed into his fucking car, but the look on her face and him freaking out after I posted 
[01:51:00]  his car into the telephone pole was worth it.  Nice.  So you're married?  You didn't stay together, right?  No, we didn't stay together.  Good.  Did you beat him up or did he run?  What did he do?  No, he couldn't get out of the car.  He broke his...  Both of his femurs got broke when I nailed his car.  Wow.  That's what you get.  We got to be nice to these truckers.  I'm learning way too much today.  Oh, they're lunatics.  I love it.  You guys are insane out there.  All right, well...  I've been single since.  All right, thank you, Mark. 
[01:51:30]  Especially since this psycho just sat there in the lot smoking while they banged and then  I'm running the guy over.  That's what I...  Talking to himself.  That's what I call self-control.  Son of a bitch, I'm going to fuck you up.  And by the time they've been together, he knows every move that she's doing.  Yeah.  Because you've been with her.  Like, you know, right now she's, like, you know, giving her that little ball tickle that  you thought was special.  Just for you.  Thought it was just for you.  Yeah, what kind of positions did you witness?  Most of the time...  This is pretty bad.  Most of the time it was her straddling him.  Yeah, there's only two you can really do in a car. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, I mean, you know, so she was definitely going at it.  She was the one controlling the situation.  He was getting the fruits of, I guess, my non-labor.  Well, not your fault.  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  All right, appreciate it.  You guys suck.  Thank you.  Bye.  These guys are insane out there.  All right, let's see what Bill wants from North Carolina.  I mean, we've got to move on.  If it's a good story, we'll go with it, but wow.  It reminds me of that scene from that movie, Help Me Out, where they're going at it and  they tied up the husband. 
[01:52:30]  Not with Jennifer Tilly.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was a nasty scene.  That was one of the sickest scenes.  She was very sexy.  What movie was that, though?  I don't remember, but there was a good lesbian stuff in it.  There was some hot stuff in that.  She was getting into it.  They were like...  Wasn't Gina Gershon in that one?  I don't know.  Was that one she was in?  Well, she did.  Like, it was...  What?  Bound.  That was Bound?  Yeah.  Oh.  That was...  In a weird way, that was a really hot scene.  They tie up the freaking husband and she's just banging away the rebel guy there.  What's his name?  He's in a lot of those movies.  Michael Madsen?  Yeah.  Oh, he's great.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's great. 
[01:53:00]  And then the guy, what?  Ends up hanging himself in that movie, right?  I don't remember.  Yeah, that was a good one.  I scrapped a few times.  That was...  Remember when we were talking about the hottest scenes in movies?  Bound might have had one or two of them in there.  That was a very sexy movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bound's incredible.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Okay.  I think I scrapped to it.  We got to move on to other things.  We're going to play coming or going in a few minutes here.  What?  Why do you have roll of quarters?  Why are you holding like 12 quarters?  Doing laundry?  No.  Laundry.  He car parked out front?  No, I...  Feed the meter.  Ha, ha, ha.  God, why did... 
[01:53:30]  Why?  Why do you have them?  All right, I'll explain.  I have no money on me, and I have like a quarter tray, and I...  Are you kidding?  And I needed to pay the cabbie.  How do you have no...  Last night after dinner...  Are you kidding?  Oh, my God.  Dude, you know me.  I'm like...  I'm pathetic.  He's the...  Last night after dinner, he says to Bob and his lovely wife, I got no money for a cab.  Opie.  What is it?  Isn't there an ATM around you?  Yeah.  Yes.  Did I pay for breakfast yesterday?  It's not that I'm cheap.  It's just like...  I don't know what my problem is. 
[01:54:00]  I never have money on me.  That's...  So then I'm digging up quarters at four in the morning so I can, you know, get a cab over  here.  The cab driver must have loved you.  Oh, they love that.  Oh, I know.  I just dumped all these quarters in his hand and said, thank you.  Yes, my friend.  You're afraid of being broke, but you don't have to be broke.  You're not going to lose...  No, it's not even the...  I swear it's not about that.  It's just...  I don't know.  What is it?  I can't...  I don't know.  I can't take care of myself.  You do?  I really can't.  They have these things at the bank you can dump your quarters in and get money?  Yeah.  Don't trust them.  I got ripped off by one of those things in Jersey. 
[01:54:30]  I'll never...  And I called...  I got ripped off in Jersey.  Whoa, whoa.  Well, I put my quarters in and nothing came out.  So I finally...  I said, forget this.  And I wound up putting them all into like a pillowcase and kept them for three years.  And then I recently bought like those change banks.  It makes that awful noise.  It puts them in the little paper things?  Yeah.  And I wound up with like $700 worth of change.  I had them for years and I broke two change banks.  I didn't say it was a great story. 
[01:55:00]  $700.  Did you then spend that spare money on hookers?  I think that was one full toilet session and probably one other session.  Yeah.  So you got something out of it.  Two things out of it.  There you go.  Two different forms of abject humiliation, self-hatred.  I've changed.  You got to go to an ATM or something.  You're one of the stars of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're half of that moniker.  It takes two seconds.  I know.  I know.  And I'm digging up quarters.  And I had to ask Bob for money for a cab.  It was awful. 
[01:55:30]  And you weren't there to order the five pound lobster.  No.  I don't have any cash for a cab.  I didn't.  What they should have done is done what I did and just walked away.  But they're such nice people that they're like, you know, here you are.  I got a 10 spot from them.  Bob gave you $10?  Yeah.  I was very surprised.  I'm sure he'll take that out of our bill.  Yeah.  I probably now have to pay $5 of that.  I had to sign a receipt over to him or something.  I don't know what that was about.  He carries receipts on it when he's handing out the change.  I got to make sure that that 10 spot is taxable to you, Opie. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, I know.  I'm going to deduct it off of my taxes.  And then what?  Huh?  All right.  One more.  Bill, what's going on?  North Carolina.  Check it in.  Yeah, man.  I've heard you guys say that I was going to be the last one.  And I had to get in there, man.  I got the best.  Actually, my wife left for Iraq in February of 2003.  And while she was gone, for some reason, man, I don't know.  I just had this feeling, you know.  And I just started reading her emails and started reading this one where she's talking to this guy, 
[01:56:30]  saying how she's sexually frustrated and missing him terribly and all this shit.  And I was kind of like just looked at it for a little bit.  Being a police officer myself, I was kind of like figuring things out.  So I went ahead and found out who it was.  It was a guy that we actually knew in San Antonio, Texas.  Him and his wife, she actually is a 2002 Miss North Carolina.  Wow.  She's fine as hell, you know.  And, well, anyway, they used to come to our house and have, like, cookouts and stuff.  Well, apparently, I didn't know. 
[01:57:00]  But they got stationed here in North Carolina with us.  And unbeknownst to me, they continued a relationship, I guess, somehow that had started in San Antonio.  So I confronted his wife.  And she and I got together.  She made an email account for him.  I made an email account for my wife.  And we emailed each other's spouses saying, hey, don't email me there anymore because my wife or my husband knows.  Ooh, good one.  Tricky.  So send all the correspondence here.  And so we started talking back and forth.  We got about two inches of emails and stuff back and forth to them admitting to everything they've ever done. 
[01:57:30]  And, well, anyway, I went to my wife's commander.  She went to her husband's commander.  Well, needless to say, they flew my wife back from Iraq.  She got court-martialed.  I have our three-year-old daughter now.  You can get court-martialed for cheating?  She wasn't stationed at Abu Ghraib, was she?  It threw them both up, man.  And the girl's name, Lindy England.  Yeah, and then the other thing is I actually ended up hooking up with his wife one night and kind of evened the score up a little bit. 
[01:58:00]  Sure, you'd have to.  That would be the obvious solution.  Why would anyone bang a cop's wife, though?  I mean, the cops can investigate and find out whatever they want.  And the thing is, what's even better is I actually met him one day.  I called him up and I said, hey, man, we need to talk.  And he was like, no, no, man, I ain't going to meet you.  You know, you're a freak and all this stuff.  I said, no, come on, man.  But anyway, you had him to meet me publicly at Books A Million.  And I went in there and I had basically a chest wire on.  It's the same one we use in our patrol car when we do a traffic stop.  And I just left it on. 
[01:58:30]  And I recorded the entire thing, him admitting to having sex.  He's like, just tell me.  Because I told him, if you don't tell me, then I'll go to your commander and we'll get him to get it out of you.  And I said, just do it this way.  And, you know, we can have everything settled this way.  Because he just got finished with special forces and all this stuff, like two years of training.  So we sat down and he told me the whole story, which his wife later used that tape for her divorce.  And now he has alimony.  This guy thought it out.  Nice.  She has alimony.  She got the house.  She has everything she ever wanted, man.  So it worked out good. 
[01:59:00]  But I'll tell you, it's tough, man, because it's two marriages over.  Did you see beforehand that, like, she was going to bang somebody else?  I've never been married.  Can you kind of tell?  Or do you think things are going great?  No.  I mean, she, well, see, it was about a year and a half before that.  She kind of acted kind of distant.  You know, it wasn't like anything sexual distance or anything like that.  She just wasn't the same happy, cheery person she was.  And when I confronted her, she said, oh, you know, nothing's going on or anything like that.  And, of course, I didn't even know this guy was in the same state. 
[01:59:30]  You know, sometimes you've got to assess yourself in the relationship, like, as a guy.  You really have to step out of it and think, am I being, like, as good as I was at the beginning of the relationship?  You know, or do you kind of take some things for granted and not, you know, if you're treating her kind of crappy?  Because some guys do that.  Talk to Laura with sex advice.  No, I'm kind of just, it's kind of obvious.  It's kind of the obvious.  Because a lot of times the girls start cheating, but you kind of, you know, maybe you kind of started screwing up a little bit. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, but you've got to assess her, too.  In the beginning, man, you're driving along, she bends over, starts sucking you off while you're cruising,  or she's shaking her ass and everything else.  And then all of a sudden, man, she just wants a missionary, you know?  I mean, come on, man.  You've got to assess her, too.  Makes a good point.  Sure.  Makes a good point.  That's true.  They are a bunch of dead fishes.  After a while, the lust goes away.  Yeah, it does.  And you're just left with the love part, and then you have this confrontation in your head.  You're like, damn, do I stay with this because of the love, or do I go find some lust? 
[02:00:30]  Well, either way, beside the point there, I mean, I just, it was kind of a hard deal.  It took about a year or so to get it all completed.  All right.  It's done.  I appreciate you guys' time.  All right.  Thanks, Bill.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye, Bill.  Okay, we've got to move on.  Yes.  Coming or going in a few minutes.  Coming or going.  The movie wasn't bound.  It was The Getaway.  Yeah, it was The Getaway.  There you go.  Thank you.  A lot of people emailing that in.  Thank you.  Okay.  Was it Jennifer Tilly, though?  Yeah.  She was in it. 
[02:01:00]  It's Kim Basinger, I think, right?  Alec Baldwin.  Alec Baldwin was in it.  It was a pretty cool movie.  Yeah.  Well, it was all right.  There were some good scenes.  Well, Gary Glenn Ross is better if you like Alec Baldwin.  That's just me.  No.  The Cooler.  I hated that movie.  You didn't like The Cooler?  It stunk.  I really liked The Cooler.  I love Macy, too.  I love Macy.  William Macy.  He was so pathetic.  He was.  But the movie was just awful.  Hey, that's my deal, Wade.  I love that one.  Wade, that's my deal.  Oh, these are some sweet numbers.  Love that movie.  Fantastic film. 
[02:01:30]  He is the best when they go to arrest him at the end, and he's just screaming, crying,  trying to get out of there.  He was in a movie called House of Games with Joe Mantegna.  No.  Okay.  He had a small part in that.  William Macy is great, but I thought The Cooler stunk.  No, I liked The Cooler.  I wanted to like it because I love him, but it's like blech.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Anthony, as we take a break here, George Bush, people want to hear these songs.  I don't know.  It is pretty cool, though.  It's pretty cool.  We did Sunday Bloody Sunday.  It's basically a guy.  We don't even know what his name is, but this is showing up on all the websites all over 
[02:02:00]  the place.  Basically, the guy took all of Bush's speeches and found lyrics within the speeches to rock  songs.  Yeah, he cuts the words out and puts them back together.  And yesterday and earlier today, we were listening to Sunday Bloody Sunday in George Bush's words.  Yes.  We got a new song from this guy, whoever he is.  I'd like some more info on him.  I'd like to give him some credit.  But he's got George Bush pretty much singing Imagine and Slash Walk on the Wild Side.  Mm-hmm.  All in the same song here. 
[02:02:30]  So let's check this out as we go to break.  Don't Go Anywhere, Coming or Going Next.  I think it's going to be pretty cool.  We'll get Steve from foundrymusic.com in here, and we'll have some fun, okay?  Right.  All right.  All right.  Imagine there's no heaven.  It's easy if you try. 
[02:03:00]  No hell below us.  Above us, only sky.  Imagine all the people  living for today.  The color girl city.  Take a walk on the wild side.  One, two, three, four. 
[02:03:30]  Imagine there's no countries.  It isn't hard to do that.  Nothing to kill or die for.  No religion, too.  Imagine all the people  living life in peace.  The color girl city. 
[02:04:00]  Take a walk on the wild side.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four.  One, two, three, four.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Imagine no possessions.  I wonder if you can. 
[02:04:30]  No need for grief or hunger.  A brotherhood of man.  Imagine all the people.  Sharing all the world.  The color girl city.  Take a walk on the wild side. 
[02:05:00]  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.  Take a walk on the wild side.

[02:12:30]  what's it what's it called  worthless human lump of shit dot com  they're little people  little people  they don't like being called midgets anymore  yeah  you don't see as many of them anymore walking the streets as you used to  well the medicines a little better  yeah they're able to like uh...  detect that early in pregnancy and yank it out  so that disaster doesn't have to be walking around upsetting people and scaring children  so they don't have to try to marry a normal sized woman and she's gonna hold their hand like a little baby but meanwhile he's the guy that fucks her and brings home the bacon 
[02:13:00]  jesus  nothing better than watching one trying to hop up into his car you know in the parking lot  we're trying to  get up in here  we're trying to sell real estate  i could teach you how to be a millionaire in real estate me and my brother  i think oh god stop you're gonna sit in a meeting with this guy his feet don't even hit the ground not even hit the ground he's under in the chair and his feet are sticking straight out like a chucky doll  all right well we're getting ready for coming or going 
[02:13:30]  coming or going  yeah  hold on i'm writing something  what are you laughing at ben  just this awful  what is that  ew  he got a blind cleric of some sort  what is that  oh he's a sheik of course  he's a sheik  okay  sure he's an upstairs  we gotta bring uh... steve in here  he's gonna help us with coming or going  he's the only one that uh... can tell us if they're coming or going in these clips  where is he  we'll explain it in a second here 
[02:14:00]  well what a shock he has  oh here he comes  here comes martini steve everybody  wow that's really loud now  what do you think of his shirt today jimmy  hard to believe he's got a red skull on it  and a tank top  ah  i like the fact that you've untucked it though  thank you  he untucked the shirt but uh... did you roll up the sleeves or did you cut those sleeves off  this is this is one of those truck stop specials  this is uh... got this at the truck stop in um...  where was that kev was that connecticut  yeah steve loves the truck stops 
[02:14:30]  it's really awful  what  it's the truck stop clothing i don't you know lounge around there i just you know the clothing the t-shirts they have  yeah  well that's equally awful that you go clothes shopping in truck areas  why  where do you go where do you buy clothes  all right you got me  exactly  we're gonna try a new game today called uh... coming or going  coming or going  we got some clips from  horror films and porno films  right  and it's our job anthony to try to figure out if the girl is uh... 
[02:15:00]  coming or going  getting effed or getting killed  right  is she getting murdered  in a horrific way  that's making her scream and yell  or is she uh... maybe taking one up the keister  which would cause her  to scream and yell  right  one one little caveat to this whole uh...  caveat  sorry  what is a caveat  oh my god what is that  caveat emptor  let the buyer beware  one little warning  one little warning  is that greg  well you're not going to get as anthony and i discussed the other day  it's very hard to find clean audio from a horror film of somebody getting brutally killed 
[02:15:30]  because everybody dies to music  yeah  in a horror film  so we had to  now smut you can find just uh...  yeah smut you can find clean audio of screaming all over the place  but with horror movies it's a little bit  a little bit more difficult  because there's sound effects and other  and music  right  that happens  so we had to augment the audio a little bit  had to tinker with it a little bit  so it's not as  it's not going to be as obvious as you might think  right  because you know you might have to put some suspenseful music behind some porno clip  right  there you go 
[02:16:00]  i think they all have suspense right  exactly  they all have suspense music behind  okay  that's the only  thanks for that caveat  you're welcome  little avocat  got some caveat on you  wait we gotta say hi to kristen  she's the first woman  duck soiree  the first woman to call our show today  kristen  yes  wait i want to smell you first  hello  how are you smelling her  it's the first woman  calling the show today  she wears evian skin cream

[02:17:00]  and there was a midget  and my boyfriend and i followed him inside  following  and he was inside  pushing around a little baby girl in a stroller  stroller  really  in the supermarket  no that was just his wife  no  no  he had like a black like a like nurse's aide with him also  yes  what a wandering mess  nurse's aide  a midget a carriage  when you see a midget especially in new york you gotta follow him for at least a block or two  see what he's up to 
[02:17:30]  yeah  yeah  we're down to  so then i i go in the parking lot and i watch him load the stroller into the into the back  you know the trunk of the car  while this like  fully you know vertically not challenged black woman watches him  and he's like lifting the stroller over his head to get it in the car  because you know he can't reach because he's a midget  so you were entertained by that  yeah you had to walk around and follow the midget

[02:21:30]  hey we got a great idea for a promotion  we want to give away a chance  ben's in here cause it was  he'll laugh at this too  we want to give a  a chance  for a listener  to watch the super bowl with opie and anthony  hello  that was the big prize  that was roger our uh...  promotions guy who knew nothing  putting that one together  we'll have you guys show up at the house  with a big screen television set 
[02:22:00]  and you can sit there with the the guy and his family  and watch the super bowl  uh... what?  we have to sit in a house with people we don't know  instead of hanging out with our own you know family and friends  and we had only been doing the show for like  i don't know it wasn't very long it was a few months  and and you know the guy that  entered the contest knows the show  but everyone else his whole family and everything  they didn't have a clue who we were  we don't care less  imagine just knocking 
[02:22:30]  knocking on someone's door during the super bowl  and saying hey mind if i hang out with you  and then sitting there you don't know anybody  and they don't know you and you're sitting there  we're supposed to watch the super bowl  i felt like i knew everyone there though  you had the you had the guy with his young hot girlfriend  oh it was everyone you see everywhere else  at every other party  you just didn't know these people  they just looked a little different  their names were different  you had the aunt that thinks she's a little wild  she's crazy  she gets a few in her and oh ho ho  she's crazy  she thinks she's funnier than she really is 
[02:23:00]  and she's wild  and if the situation was right you'd be banging her  oh she'll put the elbow in your ribs  a flotation is happening  another lady that's proud of her stupid dish  that she brought to the super bowl party  i was slaving over the stove all morning  to make these sweetest meatballs  oh look marge brought her lasagna  marge brought her you gotta taste this  cause it's just fantastic  no i don't have to taste this  tastes like placenta with a meatball in it  so anthony and i have to show up at this house  somewhere on long island  hey we're here for the super bowl 
[02:23:30]  here's your grand prize  here's your big screen television  which you know is a cool prize and all  oh lucky you you get to hang out with it and i  for the super bowl  we sat on the couch  we didn't even  aunt and i didn't even talk to each other  he sat on one side of the couch  i drank all their beer  they were so excited  they set up like video cameras  and just like had them in the corner  to videotape the whole time we were there  god that sucked  i wish someone out there was at that party  and could get those tapes  yeah wouldn't that be great  someone out there i'm sure knows that you guys 
[02:24:00]  would want to become huge thank you  huge stars  i'm sure there's a videotape of us sitting there  board shitless  it was the worst man  we had to show up  we even had to bring the beer and soda  remember we're hauling it in  it was a big presentation  we're supposed to like go  hey we're here with the beer  and the tv  usually when you have to do a radio promotion  you get like a support staff  that comes with you and sets up everything  i know ben  because ben it was ben's job at the time  and uh...  no there was no support staff  they just give us the address  and go show up before the game starts  we're like oh 
[02:24:30]  oh and by the way can you bring the soda and the beer  yeah  it was awful  absolutely awful  this is a great promotion  and his brilliant idea was the morning show at the time  mason and kalinsky  roger set it up  earl and i had to go way out to jersey  and then meet you guys in long island  by the time we got there the game was over  it was retarded planning  and roger one of roger's brilliant brilliant promotions  and then he ended up stealing everything from the station  yeah  him and eddie  you know  the only reason he was  had the job was because his uh...  uh... father-in-law 
[02:25:00]  was a big wig in the company  yeah  he had to take care of this like useless person  he was mel's best friend  yeah sure  so so you guys are pretty much saying that  before i kinda came along  you guys had to do a lot of shit work  mm-hmm  yeah not really pal  let's relax  let's calm down a little bit  i'm saying you had to go out and do that  that's that's  you kinda paved the way and saved me the trouble  we didn't  uh...  update on the oompa loompa shirt  that's available on ebay  the autographed oompa loompa shirt  is now up to one hundred eighty seven dollars and fifty cents 
[02:25:30]  is this a real bid  it seems to be  it's kinda hard to do fake bids right  you can but it kinda screws up your  you can welch on an ebay auction  that's unfortunate  but yeah it's possible  but it kinda screws up your  it's up to 201 right now  it's up to 201  the intern is jumping up and down  he  you are a smart kid danny  yeah  this kid knows what he's doing  203.51  203 alright  um...  we have to go to the phones and talk about  uh... yeah  remember this one anthony  brian from syracuse  yes brian  yeah i just wanted to know 
[02:26:00]  if you guys served uh...  a giant pop tart to eat  instead of popcorn and wings and shit  oh this son of a bitch  that would do  roger  anthony and i came from boston  where we were like um...  we were huge  i mean i  we were doing well  no we were really big  in the boston radio market  and then uh...  we got you know  we told uh...  we told uh...  that the mayor died in a fiery car accident on april fools  and we got fired  okay so then we have to like  we  we  we eat it so many times in our career  it's not even funny  once again we're in the underdog position  and and we're in the fight of our lives again 
[02:26:30]  but we came to new york  gunfire wailing over my head  we came  we came to new york and uh...  yeah we had to start over  no one cared  you know we were huge in boston  but for new york it's like  whatever dudes  we don't know who you are down here  so we had to like  you know build it up again  like we're doing here  with the xm satellite  and they uh...  they hired this promotion guy  like don't worry man  don't worry this guy  you know whatever you need  he'll get  within a day  yeah  you need a humvee  i remember them saying  if you need a two humvees 
[02:27:00]  he'll have them there the next day  he'll fucking get them right for you  right  so yeah he's giving us this big pitch in his office  like look man i'm your guy  i'm gonna make you guys big again  i'll give you the promotional staff you need to  you know to get known here in new york  he was awful  and then he would come to us every other day  with these stupid radio promotion  ideas that anthony and i just don't do  you know the show is about hanging out and stuff  let's be honest yeah  we're guilty as charged as they would say  but but there are so many other ideas 
[02:27:30]  like are you insane  yeah  you know what the show is about  and hanging out and having a good time  and realism and stuff like that  not anti-radio bits  you know what i mean  and uh... he comes to and approaches us one day  and goes  and he was happy  and skipping into the uh... into the studio to tell us this  because he thought we would just think it was the greatest thing ever  he says uh...  guys  guess what i got a remote for you  i mean like a remote  all right  you go out of the studio and set up camp somewhere 
[02:28:00]  usually  remotes that we've done are pretty cool  uh... we've done some from uh... concerts and stuff backstage  uh... so they're pretty cool  you know depending on where they are  so we thought he had a remote for us  like oz fest  we went to that  we had a great time  uh... guys i have a remote for you  oh yeah  where roger where  well in madison square garden  i'm thinking madison square garden  okay this is cool  okay  you know the garden they put on some good shows there  i'm with you so far  madison square garden  is hosting 
[02:28:30]  uh... uh... uh...  the world's largest pop tart  and i got you guys  where you can set up right next to it  and broadcast live  and broadcast live  from the world's largest pop tart  at madison square garden  we looked at it  i started laughing  because i thought it had to be a joke  and i was waiting for the punchline and everything  and yeah  no  no  he actually  was setting us up  where we would have  have our broadcast  next to a  a giant 
[02:29:00]  toaster pastry  what the  what are we gonna  what  how he thought this would enhance our program  although  i must say we have been talking about it for quite a while now  can you imagine the radio show though  oh  you know give us something to work with here  hey we're here  in front of the largest pop tart  and uh...  wow it's pretty large anthony  opie i cannot wait until uh...  two hours  we're counting down  we're gonna cut into this thing  and see if it is apple  or blueberry  that's right 
[02:29:30]  we don't know yet  we'll be taking your call  so you can guess  and whoever guesses correctly  what the toaster pastry filling is  and after this break we'll be talking to the chef  oh the guy that actually cooked the giant pop tart  that's right it's an exclusive interview with the chef anthony  i hope maybe you'll give us the ingredients to the frosting that goes on  well we can only hope  hey  where are they gonna get a toaster to put this thing in  And for all you listeners stuck in traffic because you're trying to get down to the world's largest Pop-Tart, don't you worry. 
[02:30:00]  It's going to be here a while.  It'll be here a while, and we'll be cutting little pieces off for everybody, so you'll be able to try the world's largest Pop-Tart.  This thing is huge, Hopi.  Just look at the size of it.  I think that's what he was expecting, that we would be happy.  When he walked into the studio with this, he was expecting us to be like, wow, and just pat him on the back and shake his hand and go, job well done.  Giant Pop-Tart, great job.  And then he came up with the wow window clangs. 
[02:30:30]  We sat down with him and our retarded program director, Gary.  The ice cream man.  The ice cream PD who would come in licking an ice cream cone as we're pulling our hair out of our head because of multiple problems.  And he would just come skipping in.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Go away.  Die.  And Roger.  I liked our program director, Gary, though.  He taught me all about the stock market.  Yeah, well, that's about all he did.  He was heavy up in the stock market like everyone was back then. 
[02:31:00]  But, Roger, we sit down and design out these wow stickers because we want to get them out as quickly as possible.  We meticulously pick a background color and a font color so it best shows up at distances and, you know, visibility.  Painstaking.  It took weeks to design these stickers.  We send them out.  We get the boxes back, much like the scene out of Spinal Tap when they received Smell the Glove.  Yeah, exactly.  We open up these boxes expecting to see the sticker we designed. 
[02:31:30]  It took weeks, weeks, maybe even months to design.  And Roger peels one out.  And what he's got is equivalent to a wow color form.  Yeah.  It's a clear color form.  I remember saying to myself, oh, we're fucked.  Yeah.  And we're like, wait, where are the wow stickers?  He goes, no, better than stickers.  These are window clings.  We're like, what the fuck?  What the fuck?  What?  What?  We designed it.  No.  So these, people don't have to worry about messing up their bumpers with bumper stickers. 
[02:32:00]  You could put these right on your window.  Yeah.  But what about like the people that, well, I was going to say, it's not like tinted windows  were popular.  Tinted windows.  In the late 90s.  The backs of tractor trailers, signposts, walls, anywhere else you see wow stickers around,  which is everywhere, that you will not see them because it's on a window cling.  Unbelievable.  Boxes upon boxes upon boxes of these useless window clings that, by the way, matched nothing  in font or color to the sticker that we came up with. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  But he was a genius.  He knew better.  I could see him at the sticker place having our design, everything we wanted, going up  to the counter at the sticker place and going, here's what I want.  I, and then looking up and seeing the window cling and going, hmm, I have a better idea.  I'm going to get window clings and taking the initiative, you know, all by himself, making  the decision.  What about the time he wanted us to marry a couple on Valentine's Day in a limo? 
[02:33:00]  In a limo.  So Anthony and I would broadcast live from a limo.  Right.  As a couple was getting married in the limo on their way down to Atlantic City, I think,  where the honeymoon would be.  Very good to remember this.  And we would broadcast the whole thing.  What we want you to do is pick a couple to win, a couple that's going to be married.  They could call in and we will pick a winner.  And the winner gets to get married in the limo with you two presiding over the wedding.  And you could broadcast it live from inside the limo. 
[02:33:30]  Ugh.  You worthless piece of crap.  And then people wonder why we get stupid and do all these crazy things to get attention.  Yeah, yeah.  And they wonder why we do the voyeur bus and we did, you know, the, uh.  The C word on TV.  And 55 gallon drum challenge.  And all the fun stuff that people want to hear.  Because the station itself was presenting us through people like Roger with this crap drivel  that you wouldn't hear on a morning zoo show.  A Pop-Tart indeed. 
[02:34:00]  Yes, Ben.  He then also, we were giving away satellite dishes.  And he set it up so he won one as well as our program director.  Yeah, that was another scandal.  That was another scandal.  And then when we knew that the radio station was completely falling apart, all this legendary  rock memorabilia that was hanging on the walls.  Oh, gold records from the Beatles.  Led Zeppelin lithographs that were signed by all, everybody including Bonham before he  died.  Back the car up to N.E.W.  We don't know for sure, but it seems like, um, yeah, it seems like he took a lot of that 
[02:34:30]  stuff.  Yeah.  Stuff signed by Kurt Cobain just hanging up on the walls.  I could use this.  Everything just disappeared.  Everything.  The best was, allegedly, there was a huge box of stuff.  He came in one morning on one of his last days and we had Eddie, who was, you know,  Eddie was handicapped.  We had Eddie.  Handy capable.  Yes.  He was handy capable.  He also distributed our mail, which was a whole other thing.  They had the retarded guy distribute the mail at N.E.W. 
[02:35:00]  But he had Eddie take everything down to his car.  He had this huge box.  And sure enough, you know, no one ever knew what happened to the gold records.  Yeah, we used to get mail.  And like, I'd get Ben's mail.  Opie's mail would have like Earl's and the radio chick's mail.  And then he would come into our office at the mail guy, Eddie, and go, what's this  name?  What's his name here say?  And point to the envelope.  He couldn't read the names on the envelope, but they gave him the job of delivering the  mail.  You can't make this stuff up.  No.  Yeah.  They had a guy.  I mean, you know, he was very cool, but he was a little slow. 
[02:35:30]  I can't.  Well, what's the mail?  What's the address on this?  You know, what's this name?  Is this Opie?  And so they gave him, you know, a little more responsibility.  His job was to just take care of the garbage.  He was a huge Mets fan.  I still see him.  He's, you know, I don't want to trash the guy.  M-O-O-N.  That spells Muni.  But they're like, yeah, I think we want him delivering the mail.  And it's just like every day it was an adventure.  So he'd deliver the mail.  It was an adventure.  And take out the garbage.  That was his job.  And sometimes the mail ended up in the garbage.  Well, there was a sales guy who was like going through a divorce who had all his bills 
[02:36:00]  coming through the station.  Was that the gay sales guy that we saw in pictures online?  I was in that vote, too.  At one point, I was in that same vote.  Going through the divorce, I didn't have an address.  So I was getting some of my mail, like cell phone bills and stuff sent to the station.  I had my cell phone turned off because I don't know where it ended up.  I don't know.  Whose name is this?  I put it in the caramelo box.  It gets even better when we switch formats. 
[02:36:30]  We got all these new mic flags.  Nobody could find the mic flags.  And he put them in a closet.  10-10 wins.  They were missing for months.  Yeah, it was in a back like an air conditioning unit closet up in 10-10 wins, the news station.  That's where all the new mic flags were.  It was just a mess over there.  He would put stuff somewhere.  You'd be expecting something.  Like, oh, this person's supposed to send something to the show.  And you'd be like, where is it?  And then weeks later, you'd find it somewhere behind a desk or in a closet. 
[02:37:00]  I don't know what name he had.  It gets even better.  We were giving away TVs one time.  Oh, right.  And he was in charge of bringing the – I'm sorry.  I'm laughing, sorry.  He was in charge of bringing the TVs up.  And he got on the freight elevator.  And the guys in the freight elevator are like, I don't care.  Just take one.  We lost like three TVs.  Yeah, they were like, hey, what do you got there?  Oh, they're TVs.  They come in for the station.  And the guys, of course, trying to take advantage of them.  And they're like, how many you got there?  Hey, can I grab one?  Oh, yeah, take one.  You take a TV. 
[02:37:30]  You probably thought they were going to help him bring the TVs upstairs or something.  It was – I'm just amazed we made anything of ourselves.  Me to say, you take a TV.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, God, shut up.  It was just – I'm just amazed.  We had no help over there.  None whatsoever.  And then in that little bathroom – here's a great Muni story.  Great Scott Muni story.  There was that disgusting bathroom by the studio.  Someone had thrown paper towels into the toilet.  So Muni comes out and he's like, goddamn, motherfucker.  You know, who did this?  And he goes, it's okay, Scott. 
[02:38:00]  I'll take care of it.  Puts his bare hand into that disgusting toilet.  Oh, yeah, he wouldn't care.  Muni's like, Jesus Christ.  He just walked away.  It was hilarious.  It was just an adventure over there.  The freak show over there.  It really was an adventure.  So where were we?  I don't even know what we were doing.  Oh, coming or going?  Let's get Steve back in here.  Oh, that's right.  Martini Steve has to make his entrance back into the studio.  There he is.  Oh, that is really loud. 
[02:38:30]  Yeah, that was loud.  Yeah, you could crank that down a little bit.  Which one are you?  Let me try it again.  Go ahead.  All right, I think it's this one.  Martini Steve.  That's perfect.  Okay.  Hi, Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Hi, Jim.  All right, so what do we got again?  Because we have short-term memory on the show.  You have a series of random clips on a CD right there in front of you.  Some are from horror movies.  Some are from porno movies.  Yeah.  You have to guess which is which.  Is it all girls getting murdered? 
[02:39:00]  No.  Oh, so it's just murder scenes that could be a girl screaming because they're getting  a knife in them or hacked up with a machete or a drill bit through the back.  And can you describe each scene or not really?  See, that would have been cool, too.  What do you mean?  Like, after we've guessed and then we find the answer, you can tell us, well, in this  scene, the girl is getting, you know, a big color one.  I was up all night picking through porn and horror movies.  All right.  Trying to find this stuff.  So, yeah, I can tell you exactly which one. 
[02:39:30]  All right, want to do the first clip?  Let's hear the first clip.  This is coming or going.  Coming or going.  We've got to guess if they're being killed or they're having an orgasm.  Now, that might seem obvious.  You might say to yourself, well, that's got to be a murder.  But you never know because I know I heard one clip that Steve played for me of a girl  getting, what was it, anal for the first time? 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  And she's screaming, I swear, it sounded like someone was killing her.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, that's the beauty of the game.  So, you just don't know.  You really just don't know.  I'm going to go around the room and see who's better at this game, okay?  Okay.  Kind of like what's in my pants.  Can I hear it again?  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Pot it up.  Whoops.  If that's sex, it's even better.  I'm going to say sex just because I want it to be. 
[02:40:30]  All right.  I'm going to say that's a girl getting it in the ass.  I'm going to say that's a murder.  All right.  Wait.  Sex, murder.  I'm saying coming.  No, I'm saying coming, too, man.  That's sex.  Coming, and Jim says going.  Yeah, murder.  Should we go right to Steve or play?  We'll go to Steve, find out the answer, and then we'll play the clip.  All right.  Steve?  Coming or going?  Going.  Oh, that is a murder.  That's a murder.  I was hoping it was going to be.  Oh, no.  All right. 
[02:41:00]  Let's hear that.  This is a murder.  See, to scream that long, your eyes have to be open wide.  That's not a pleasant scream.  It tapers off with a knife in the strap.  I was just hoping.  Yeah.  You know what?  I've got to find that snuff film.  Oh.  Remember that snuff film we had?  Actually, I destroyed it.  I didn't think it was real, though.  I don't know.  Snuff films aren't real.  I don't know, man.  I don't know.  I know. 
[02:41:30]  There was a dead guy film.  Well, that's...  All right.  Well, Steve, what movie was that from before we go off on another tangent?  That was Friday the 13th, part four.  Oh.  Nurse gets pinned up against a wall by her neck and impaled.  Nice.  I don't remember that scene.  Nice.  I don't remember that one.  I have this friend, Buzzy, who collected a lot of videotapes and things like that.  He was the first one that had the Bud Dwyer video, by the way.  Yeah, it was great.  Because he worked in TV.  This was way before the internet and all that crap.  So when this stuff happened, you know, you had to be in TV to get a nice copy. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Where did you get stuff like that?  You had to be in TV.  And they would trade the tapes with each other.  Now we get everything.  Just like that.  But this was the day.  In a second.  It was unbelievable when you got to see stuff like this.  So I guess they had the Bud Dwyer video of the guy from the, what was he, a politician  in PA.  That's what I do, yeah.  At a live news conference, he blows his brains out.  Very famous video.  And then these sick Fs that worked in TV, they got the video and then made a rap video out  of it.  Remember? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, they put rap music to it and then would play it forward and backwards real quick  so it looked like he was dancing.  And his hair would flip up to the hip-hop beat.  It was great.  It was really funny.  Really great.  So Buzzy put together like a best-of tape of all sorts of crazy crap that they collected  in the newsroom.  And explain the one.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, we were watching a video, one of the videos on it, and it was, you know, porno.  It started like porno.  It was a close-up of a guy's junk and a girl's hand. 
[02:43:00]  And they were sitting on a couch.  And the girl is kind of working the guy.  And he's not kind of feeling it because it was pretty limp.  But she's just working him.  And then they start zooming out slowly.  No, no, no.  And she, well, as they're zooming out, she's taking her hand and getting a little rough  with him.  You know, she's kind of pulling on his testes and his bag.  And she starts twisting a little bit.  Like a doorknob.  A little bit.  Just twisting.  A little bit.  And then as they're panning back more and more, she twists until one point I look and 
[02:43:30]  went, did she just go all the way around with that?  Yeah.  And she did.  She had gone a complete 360 with his ball bag.  And his balls looked like they were going to just pop out of the sack.  Pop out of the sack.  So she goes around once and now she starts lifting his ass off the couch by his ball sack.  And they're turning like wicked colors.  If I may, you know, give a tribute to Boston today.  Wicked.  And then another turn around.  Two complete turns and lifts him off the couch by the sack.  And the guy isn't even twitching.  Unless they zoom out and get a full view, you realize the guy's dead. 
[02:44:00]  He's a dead guy on the couch with this woman manipulating his genitalia.  It's the sickest thing, man.  His eyes are all hazed over and glazed barely open.  A little slit.  His mouth is a little open.  Thighs have the X's.  Yeah, the X's on him.  In cartoons.  But he was dead.  I don't know if it was taken in a funeral parlor or something.  Maybe they, you know, decided to do that.  I don't know.  The guy OD'd and they figured they'd take the camcorder out.  I don't know what the situation was, but the guy was dead. 
[02:44:30]  Dead.  Yeah.  And this was part of this video.  He's dead.  Oh, my God.  We got to play that today.  Holy ass.  What?  Play what?  Bill?  We got to turn the new show on to Bill.  Oh, God.  I don't even think.  What a cringe moment that was.  All right.  I got to find that.  Bill?  Well, let's continue with our game then.  Yes, I'm sorry.  Coming or going?  So we're up to the second clip here?  Yes.  Let's hear the second clip.  Trying to figure out if this person is getting murdered or having an orgasm.  Mm-hmm.  All right. 
[02:45:00]  That's easy.  That's pretty easy.  All right.  I'll start.  We'll give you that one.  I'll start.  That's sex.  Yeah.  That's sex.  Sex.  Jimmy?  I'll take the same risk.  Yeah.  Okay.  That's an even money one right there.  Is she being killed?  Fuck me.  Yeah.  Steve?  Yeah.  Yeah, you got it.  That was one of the easy ones. 
[02:45:30]  I like the ominous music.  You're getting fucked, bitch.  Can you tell us a little something about that clip?  That's from a DVD called Full Anal Access.  Wow.  And that's exactly what was happening.  Yeah.  She's being raped by Tor Johnson.  A woman, a man his size would have trouble anally raping a girl without bumping into walls.  Jimmy's in the lead here.  Are we ready for clip three?  Clip three. 
[02:46:00]  Coming or going?  Shit!  God!  Is that a guy?  Wow.  Yeah, that's a better one.  All right.  Now that could go either way.  Can we hear that again, sweetie?  No.  Angel!  All right.  Please?  This is too obvious.  Shit!  God!  Oh!  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Steve doesn't own any gay porn.  Yeah.  So that's got to be a murder.  Wow. 
[02:46:30]  I think the rhythmic moaning on it, I don't know, that would lead me to believe that maybe  Steve doesn't own that, but Foundry Music being the smut capital of the world.  Yeah, we truly are smut peddlers.  There's probably a way he can hook up and get that.  So I'm going to say that is a guy taking it up the ass.  Um, I mean, it's hot, like a lot of the clips of guys taking it in the ass, but I'm going  to say it's a murder.  All right.  Oh, there's another choice that I think it could be. 
[02:47:00]  What?  A Yankee fan.  All right.  Jim says murder.  You say sex head?  Yeah, I'm saying that's some hardcore gay sex.  All right.  Steve.  That is murder.  Oh, damn.  Yes!  Yeah.  Yeah.  That is Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The new one.  Oh.  Guy gets leg cut off with chainsaw.  Oh, nice one.  Yes!  God!  Oh!  Is that the one that, uh, that girl from, what, Seventh Heaven?  Yeah.  Is that this show?  Yep.  She is fantastic in that movie. 
[02:47:30]  She's wearing a t-shirt.  So true with blood and sweat.  It's all, oh, fantastic.  It's a wife beater, isn't it?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  You know who took me out of it in that movie?  It was Arlie Ermey.  I love him so much, but I can't be scared watching him.  You know something?  It added a little humor to it that I think the original Chainsaw Massacre had in its own  little way.  It's kind of funny to watch, so him being in that was kind of cool.  And I love anything he's in.  I don't care.  He's just great.  You're saying Mississippi Burning?  Yeah.  He was the greatest.  Yes.  He's amazing.  Thank you, Chris Farley. 
[02:48:00]  Why?  That was awesome.  That was awesome.  He was the greatest.  When you were in the bathroom and Private Piles shot you.  Did that hurt?  I met Pesci outside the comedy cellar one night.  Kevin James introduced me for a picture.  Kevin James?  Yes.  Who I know for years.  Throwing James around.  Well, no, but I know Kevin for years before.  And I met Pesci, and I wanted to have that moment with him, and I should have quoted JFK, 
[02:48:30]  and I'm such a nothing.  I went, dude, I'm a big fan, and I wanted to spit my own face.  That's what you say to this guy.  Everyone says that.  Every fat girl who've never seen a film he did.  I'm a big fan.  They saw Jimmy Hollywood once.  That's what I say.  I'm a big fan.  Ugh.  Put your fist in my little mouth.  You're choked.  Yeah, I should have said something about whose wig was that in JFK, Enigma wrapped in a riddle.  Something.  Something.  Something everyone doesn't give him.  Hey, Stalker Patty. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, did she bring a gift?  I don't know.  Her first visit to the new Opie and Anthony show.  Look at her.  She's looking contemplative.  Yeah.  She looks really nervous.  All right.  Look at how long her hair is.  Her Aussie glasses.  God, we have been off the air a really long time.  Because we cut our hair just before we got fired.  We shaved our head right before we got fired, and she hasn't cut it since.  And it's down to, what, her shoulder blades?  Yeah, she looks like one of the Ramones.  Mopey Ramone.  Mopey Ramone.  She's laughing. 
[02:49:30]  I guarantee she has no idea what that means.  No, she's 15 seconds behind.  Okay.  Coming or going.  Here's clip four.  Jim is three for three so far.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, good.  A single scream.  Okay.  A single scream.  That's a little different.  Yeah, yeah.  A single scream.  Anthony? 
[02:50:00]  I need it one more time.  All right.  Oh, wait.  Okay.  Hold on.  Got the music at first.  Oh, yeah.  Hmm.  Oh, yeah.  Again, I want it to be sex so bad.  I'm going to say sex.  Okay.  Jimmy?  I heard a little, ugh, in the beginning of it, so I'm also going to say sex.  Oh.  It's sex.  It has to be.  I'll say sex, too. 
[02:50:30]  Steve?  That's murder.  Wow.  What?  Yeah.  That's murder.  Don't tell me.  Was that first gasp a gasp a surprise?  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  What is that from?  It's, again, from Texas Chainsaw, the new one.  The girl walks into the Hewitt family basement and knifes her friend, who is hanging up on  a meat hook. 
[02:51:00]  Right, right.  Look at Steve all excited.  Yeah.  I can't wait until he goes, is that sex or murder?  And he goes, it's both.  We can all whack our bags on the console.  All right.  Clip five.  Coming or going?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Wow.  Come on, Steve.  All right.  That's a little obvious.  Let's go to Jimmy first.  I'm going to say it's murder, but with a big black cock. 
[02:51:30]  It's sex.  Okay.  Anthony?  Very good.  Sex.  Yeah.  Sex across the board again here.  Yeah.  That was one of the obvious.  I think that was one of my first attempts.  Can we hear that again?  Yeah.  Hold on.  Just this once.  Come on.  No one's ever died like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  You have stomach cancer.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Jimmy has four. 
[02:52:00]  I have three, and Anthony has two.  Yeah.  Here's the next clip.  Coming or going?  All right.  Wow.  Getting a little easier.  That's murder.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to guess that Steve and his apparently two DVDs.  If it's not anal intruders, it's Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  So that was a...  Jesus.  First of all, for the next contest, can we get him a blockbuster video card? 
[02:52:30]  Well, that's the scene in Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The new one.  You know.  Is it sex?  I don't know.  There's a chainsaw noise.  Oh, that was a murder, I believe.  Murder across the board?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's murder, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That is really funny.  Take a wild cast.  Oh, Steve stinks.  No, you know, I did pull from a bunch of movies, but I was so punchy when I actually had to 
[02:53:00]  randomize them.  That is really funny.  Alphabetical order.  Yeah.  All right.  Now it's Jimmy five.  I got four.  Anthony has three.  Here's the next clip.  Coming or going?  All right.  Oh.  Well, well, you know.  I don't like Steve's look like that.  He's trying to throw you.  I know he is with his awful expressions.  What's wrong, Ben?  It smells like you again. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, I just, something slipped out.  I got excited.  All right.  I get excited when the clips are playing.  Sometimes a little bubble comes out.  All right.  I just sprayed the mic.  Anybody want to hear that one again?  I'd love to.  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, let's hear it.  Okay.  Well, yeah, sex.  Yeah.  Yeah, sex.  All right.  I want to try to tie this up.  I'm going with murder.  Oh, I'm taking a gamble.  Long shot.  I got to agree with that.  It's sex. 
[02:54:00]  I'm taking a gamble here.  Steve?  Sex.  It is sex.  Damn it.  You got to try to tie it up, but sometimes on the obvious, you got to go with the.  All right.  That's it.  Don't worry, Opie.  You can't drop four in a row.  Never happens.  Yeah, that's sex.  Okay.  Damn it.  Don't worry.  Jim has six.  Anthony has four.  I have four.  I have four.  She's having her vagina caved in by David Ortiz.  All right. 
[02:54:30]  We're up to the next clip.  What movie was that in?  That was Throat Yogurt.  Throat Yogurt.  Oh.  I have that.  That's a good one, isn't it?  Yeah.  You took that one home.  You bet I did.  You know something?  Steve came in.  Yeah, please.  Give me some throat yogurt.  What's the throat yogurt?  Steve came in the other day, and he puts down a stack of DVDs.  Some porno.  And they were gone in two seconds.  I figured as much.  I have to plan when I deliver this.  I have a shipment for you guys from Yoshi.  He works for Evil Angel, which is the biggest porn company. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  Look at Steve.  He's like, relax.  That's great.  Evil Angel?  Yeah.  Yoshi wants me to give you guys a stack, so I will give you porn.  Whatever you want.  If there's any tranny porn in there, give it to me.  I'll ship it right back.  Right.  Right.  You'll get rid of it.  Evil Angel.  Oh, yeah.  Sorry.  All right.  Here's some.  There we are.  Atta boy, Ben.  Thank you, Ben.  A couple of these.  Atta boy.  Some of the titles, Anthony?  Full Anal Access Volume 4.  All right.  Because there are so many unanswered questions in number three.  That's right.  And their slug on this one, nonstop ass pounding. 
[02:55:30]  All right.  That's good.  This one, blow it out of your ass.  Okay.  Watch these girls really blow it out of their ass while they take that big dick up their ass.  Just don't kill the ending for me.  Wow.  Riot Sluts Volume 1.  Her first interracial scene, Ariana Jolie.  She's a slave to black cock.  I love her.  She has really big vag lips. 
[02:56:00]  She's so sexy.  Ariana Jolie.  I want that.  The Riot Has Begun is the slug for that one.  Can I see that one?  And Sexy Euro Girls No. 2.  Thanks, baby.  Melissa Larn and Mandy Bright.  Insatiable European nymphs take it in the rear.  And then there's a whole slew of girls and guys that are in this one.  Frank Gunn.  Oh, my God.  They're trying to say that Cheryl Teagues is the ageless woman.  She's on Fox News Channel right now.  She looks good there, but she's not ageless.  She looks awful at the Donald Trump roast.  A lot of makeup going on there. 
[02:56:30]  Wait, is that movie about some sort of illegal stocking?  They're bringing things in the back door?  What is that?  No, I'll sum it up for you.  On the back, it says, these insatiable beauties are hungry for cock.  So, I don't know.  They leave it vague for you to figure out yourself.  Girls from Ukraine, France, and Hungary join for a furious fuckfest.  I'm sure you come as they come.  Enjoy Steve Holmes.  Steve Holmes production.  Oh, all right.  Kind of like Steve C. 
[02:57:00]  Back to the game?  Wow, look at this animal pounding this blonde.  Look at that.  That is.  Oh, lucky girl.  Mm-hmm.  That's terrible.  Oh, this guy's.  Oh, I get blow it out of your ass and full anal access?  You can also have sexy girl girls, too.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Blow it out of your ass.  That blow it out of your ass is a collector's item.  That is.  It is.  You can't find those anywhere.  Why?  Because I, you know, for whatever reason, these things go out of print.  Is that one of those bubble videos? 
[02:57:30]  Bubble videos.  No, no, no, no.  This is actually, I took a clip from that of Jasmine St. Clair firing a flame from a butane  torch out of her ass.  Made a tiny little 15-second clip.  It would be four years ago.  It got set all over the internet and back again.  And I haven't been able to find another copy of that since.  Why would you want that, though?  I don't like anything coming out of the ass.  It's just novelty.  But I'm not into novelty sexually.  I don't like anything goofy.  You know, funny, wacky things in the dumper. 
[02:58:00]  Ugh.  Nothing.  You don't like goofy.  You like girls taking dumps on you.  What's goo?  Who's laughing when that's happening?  Who's elbow ribbing?  You're just laying down there.  You're whacking off, taking it like a man.  Quite funny when she has a lot of fiber and it just bounces off your chest and you have  to put it back on there.  Well, believe me, when she's had no fiber, that could be a real disaster.  If there's anything that kills her mood, believe me.  It's Mount St. Helens all over your chest.  I love how they're trying to sell these.  It's a paintball accident on your chest.  These DVDs with special features.  Yeah.  It says bonus footage. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah.  Isn't bonus footage in a porno disc just more porno?  No, they do behind-the-scenes stuff now.  They give you another camera angle.  But they say behind-the-scenes and then bonus footage is a separate thing.  Yeah.  I think bonus footage is just more smut.  Yeah.  Photo shoot, come shot recap?  Yeah.  What is that?  Those guys that get off on just watching guys blow nuts.  It's just money shots.  Yeah.  So you can just see the money shots.  Director's bio.  Who cares?  That you're going to want to see.  Web access.  Mac and PC compatible. 
[02:59:00]  All region coding.  And digital stereo sound.  Do they have Easter eggs?  There's probably some Easter eggs on here, yeah.  All right.  And in the bonus section, it says, like, meet the stepfather that drove her into this profession.  Got a beard.  Let's get back to coming or going.  What do you say?  All right.  We only have, what, 15 more clips to go?  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Like 10.  10.  10.  Oh, that's 10.  All right.  10.  They get better.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  Let's see if there's any surprises in any of those. 
[02:59:30]  All right.  Here's coming or going.  Okay.  Murder or sex?  Oh, okay.  That's kind of tough.  All right.  Game on.  That's a little tough.  Game on.  Anyone want to hear it again?  I'd love to.  Hear it again.  All right.  Game on.  Oh, yeah.  I got it.  Me too.  I so got it.  You do?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Jimmy. 
[03:00:00]  Six.  I'm going to put Brown out there and say murder.  Oh, you lose so bad.  It's sex.  You could hear the skin on skin.  You could hear the pounding if you listen closely.  What?  Yeah.  Let me hear.  Before we go to Steve, listen for the pounding at the very beginning.  That could be a knife going into her chest.  Oh, no.  Yeah. 
[03:00:30]  It's sex.  That might have been a tool.  Steve?  Murder.  Yes.  Oh, no.  Nice.  Which Friday the 13th was it?  I can't remember.  Was it whichever Friday the 13th?  I thought you dubbed in that music.  That was just there?  That was there.  I recognize the music.  I'm like, I couldn't do that.  Oh, man.  Exactly.  No, don't go by the music.  Don't go by the music.  That's where he's trying to throw us off.  Exactly.  I'm dubbing in music.  Yeah, he's throwing in music.  He's throwing in the music.  Oh, wow.  Oh, nice.  Girl in rev gets knifed in.  I got to run.  So, this is murder.  Let's hear it again. 
[03:01:00]  What's happening to her there?  She's getting, it's a girl in a life raft getting a knife jammed through her back.  See?  There you go.  I thought that was what the skin was.  I thought it was right.  Sex.  It sounded like a scene from Throat Yogurt.  Yeah, it could have been.  All right.  Here we go.  We got Jimmy, one, two, three, four, six.  Anthony, five.  Making a comeback.  Making a comeback.  I think I hope it's falling into the turlet.  I really am.  Here's clip number nine. 
[03:01:30]  All right.  That's Throat Yogurt, you idiot.  That's sex.  Oh, it's pretty obvious.  That's sex.  Cross the board?  Sex.  Yeah, sex.  All right.  I thought I mixed it pretty well.  All right.  Yeah, that was Riot Sluts.  That was a girl getting blasted with a newspaper with a ball gag in her mouth.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Oh, man.  Ooh. 
[03:02:00]  Ariana Jolie loves to be gagged, too.  She's a good girl, man.  I saw a scene.  Well, whatever.  All right.  Very good.  We all got that one.  Here's the next clip.  Oh.  That's tough.  That's tough because that could be, you know, a girl.  Sounds like she's crying.  How hot would that be?  Oh, Barry.  Anthony, it's to you.  I'm going to have to hear that again.  I agree. 
[03:02:30]  Okay.  Wow.  That's a toughie.  She's crying.  So it could either be she's anticipating getting murdered or she's getting that first big one  up the keister.  I'm going to say sex.  I'm going to say sex.  Sex?  Yeah.  All right.  Jimmy?  I will also say sex because the anticipation of murder can't be one of the clips. 
[03:03:00]  It's murder or sex.  So to me, that has to be.  Something has to be happening.  And that sounds like sex.  I have to gamble again.  I like the way you're trying to creep up to the top.  You're saying murder?  Well, that's the only way I'm going to come back.  Good point.  I'm going to go with murder.  Steve?  Murder.  Oh, wow.  How is she being killed?  Wow.  I think she was getting strangled in one of the Halloween movies.  Oh, I didn't think of strangulation.  She's silly me.  Oh. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, this is from the Lifetime movie, The JonBenet Ramsey Story.  All right.  You hear the little kuduk as the cowboy hat hits the floor?  It makes a kuduk sound?  Yeah, kuduk as the little stiff brim hits the floor.  We've got a couple more.  Does that little roll on the floor like when you drop a dime on a counter?  The little kuduk of the duct tape and the little shush of the ransom note being written.  We are from a foreign group. 
[03:04:00]  Worst written ransom note ever.  Ever.  I am not a member of the Ramsey family.  Jesus.  Idiot investigators in Colorado.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Who put the black and white porn up on the TV?  No, that's Puff Daddy.  Oh, it's P. Diddy with Kelly Ripa.  Kelly Ripa.  Okay.  Sorry.  I thought it was that riot sex.  No, no.  Oh, riot sluts.  Riot sluts. 
[03:04:30]  Riot sluts.  Yes.  That's right, Kelly.  We have a riot sluts coming in today.  Coming or going.  Here's the next clip.  All right.  Let's hear it.  It's a game now.  Oh, that's a toughie, too.  It kind of sounds obvious, but I don't.  One more time.  One more time. 
[03:05:00]  I'm going to go sex.  Yeah, I will, too.  Your pen doesn't work?  No.  Yeah, perhaps.  Can't borrow mine, Ope.  Perhaps if you didn't tap them.  I know.  Yeah.  Sessently.  You clogged it.  I was just trying to get on Ope's good side.  Here, take mine.  Take my pen.  All right.  Sex.  Anthony.  I got to hear it again. 
[03:05:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, sex.  Jimmy.  Damn it.  I said sex.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was trying to get the pen.  I said.  Let's go.  I said.  Steve.  Murder.  Oh, and I was going to go with murder.  Are you serious?  Well, there's only two options.  What is that from?  It's from Halloween H2O.  She gets killed coming out of a dumbwaiter. 
[03:06:00]  Girl gets killed coming out of a dumbwaiter.  Damn it.  How did she get killed?  Michael Myers knifed her.  That sounded like porno.  None of us got that one.  Damn it.  I like to wear sweaters.  All right, let's get through this stupid game.  Here's the next clip.  What the hell was that?  I'll say.  Oh, wow.  I got to hear that again.  Me too.  I don't even know what it was. 
[03:06:30]  It sounded like...  What the hell?  There's something going on there.  It almost sounded like a gurgle.  Yeah.  It sounded like someone's raping Chaka from Land of the Lost.  Is that an answer?  All right.  I guess we go to Jimmy first here.  I'll have to go with murder.  You are now a murderer, little Alex.  I'll say it's a murder. 
[03:07:00]  Your victim has died.  Antonio.  You know, I should go with my first instinct.  They say that's usually right.  I'm saying sex.  I'm going to say sex as well.  Damn it.  Come on.  Go with murder.  No, because I think that's some throat yogurt again.  I'll say what you want.  Sex.  Yeah.  All right.  Now we got a game.  All right.  Now we're moving up on Jimmy.  What?  Sex, that's from that Riot Sluts movie, and it's a girl-on-girl thing where one girl's 
[03:07:30]  on the ground getting choked out with a nightstick with a dildo being rammed in her throat.  Oh.  I like that.  Yeah.  What's the score, Opie?  What's the score so far?  Listen to the clip as I count it up.  From the Justin Volpe story.  Was he choking her and kind of moving the stick so she went,  Opie 6? 
[03:08:00]  Get the nightstick skull for me.  How many clips we got left?  Not many.  No, not many.  What's the score?  It's tie.  It can't be all tied up.  You were way far behind.  No, because I took...  Have you been cheating?  I took a couple gambles there.  Norton fell apart.  I really have...  We all have seven.  All right.  Seven's across the board.  Oh, I'll say.  Here we go.  This game's not as easy as you think.  I got it in the bag now.  I can just sit back and do nothing.  Yeah, maybe Kevin Brown can guess. 
[03:08:30]  Here's the next clip.  Coming or going?  Oh, God.  All right, Steve.  Jesus, Steve.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  Well, out of principle, you know what?  I don't even care if I'm wrong.  Out of principle, I'm just saying it's murder.  I don't want to hear that again.  I don't want to think that Steve can find this crap on his website.  You know, it could go either way. 
[03:09:00]  I understand that.  Out of principle, I'm saying murder.  I'm just saying fucking murder.  Jesus.  You want to hear it again?  Yeah, I don't want to, but we have to for the game's sake.  Yeah, all right.  Oh, God.  That's a gangbang, but I've got to say murder, man.  I'm just saying, hmm.  I'm going to say that Ben smuggled that out of Sirius when he worked there. 
[03:09:30]  Wow.  Wow, we're going there.  Wow.  I think I know who that was, too.  Wow.  It's bigger and blacker than I'd ever hoped.  Oh, let's see.  Anthony?  I'm going to say murder.  I know it's sex.  I just know it. 
[03:10:00]  I am also going to say murder.  Really?  So we're murders across the board.  All right, I'm going to change my guess.  Can I change my guess?  So now you're going to change, because you're only changing it based upon our answers.  Now you've got to keep it.  You've got to keep it.  You're locked in.  It's like Jeopardy when you're right in that final answer.  Steve?  Kev, do you know what it is?  Yeah.  All right.  It's murder.  It is murder.  It is.  It's actually, you know what?  Damn it, you changed your answer, Opie.  No, you didn't.  What?  Like, what?  Damn it, we're stupid.  We should have made him let him change it.  Let's hear the clip first. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, God.  That doesn't sound hot.  That sounds like gay sex.  It really did sound hot.  I found that in Halloween H20.  Adam Arkin gets killed.  Wow.  And what?  Is his buddy standing near him or something?  Jamie Lee Curtis.  Jamie Lee Curtis is the other voice.  Geez, that sounded like a man's voice.  Well, maybe.  I'm a hermaphrodite.  I've heard that.  I love it.  Sure.  Sure.  All right, Jamie.  How many more clips we've got?  Hopefully one.  No, not many.  Not many. 
[03:11:00]  There's a couple really obvious ones at the end that I threw in there.  All right.  You're a weird guy, Steve.  Here we go.  Here's the next clip.  All right.  That's really tough.  One more time, sweetie.  All righty, hon.  Shut up.  I know that.  All right, sex.  Yeah, I'm saying sex.  I'm going to say sex, too.  You're right.  Of course I am.  Yes, sex.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  You're going to be saying, oh, yeah, if she's getting killed, first of all.  Yeah, I just heard that then.  All right.  What movie was that from?  That was Full Anal Access.  Of course it was.  It was a dildo scene.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  He took 30 clips off of four films.  Dude, you have any idea how hard it is to find people getting killed without sound effects?  All right.  I apologize.  Thank you, Uncle.  All right.  Here's the next one.  Okay. 
[03:12:00]  Jeez.  God.  See, now I'm all confused, though.  This is very difficult.  Well, I'm going to say murder, even though I think she's taking a huge one.  All right.  You're going to say murder?  Yeah.  Jimmy?  Murder.  It is a murder.  It's another scene.  You do?  Yeah.  It's definitely murder because you could hear the implement, whatever it is.  Well, there could be an implement.  Like hitting wood or whatever it is, right? 
[03:12:30]  Wood.  What is it, Jim?  It's murder.  What scene, Jim?  What scene?  Oh, I don't know the scene.  I said that because Ant and I guessed the same thing, and I didn't want Dumb Ope changing  it and getting ahead of us, so I used reverse psychology to get him to go with us.  Gotcha.  I don't want him to guess different.  No!  No!  No!  Very good.  Yeah.  That's Jason Part 10.  Oh.  Part 10.  Jason 10. 
[03:13:00]  Jason X.  Yeah.  Which one was that one?  Jason works at the mall?  All right.  It's still tied.  10, 10, 10.  Jason works at the mall.  What am I, a zoo crew member with that awful joke?  Which one is this?  Jason flies a plane?  I have uncensored access, and that's the best I can fire out.  Oh.  Thin-lipped faggot.  All right.  Jason has an ice cream?  Yeah.  Here's the next clip.  What a douche.  Coming or going?  Maybe we should have stopped this game at 10 clips instead of, what are we up to? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, it's an endless game.  What are we up to, like, we've got 30?  Almost done.  Douche or dress it?  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  All right.  A lot of action there, whether it's murder or sex.  I'm up for sex.  I'll say, um, some anal, yeah.  I'm going to say sex, too.  That's definitely anal.  What is that from Jason gets a smooch? 
[03:14:00]  Steve?  Steve?  That's sex.  That's, uh, that's from that blow it at your ass.  That's a first-time anal scene.  Oh!  Wow.  Wow.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Wow.  Yeah, she's taking it.  How many clips we got left?  Two?  That's it.  Okay, we're all tied still.  Still tied.  We've got to break this tie.  I'll say.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[03:14:30]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Wow.  Wow, this could...  That's really something.  Sounds like someone's getting banged while Foreman hits the heavy bag.  Maybe it's Dick Sadler being raped.  I'm going to go with, uh...  Oh, well, no.  It's Anthony.  Ah!  Can we hear that again?  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  I...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[03:15:00]  Ah!  Ow!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  I'm going to say...  Murder.  Ooh.  Damn.  Jimmy?  I have to agree with, uh...  Young Kumey.  I will also say murder.  I'm going for the win right now.  Oh, he's going for the tiebreaker.  Oh, he's taking a chance on the sex.  He's going to knock himself right down alone into second place.  I know.  Write it down, Opie.  Write it down.  I see you hovering with the pen.  Yeah, write that down.  I'll go with... 
[03:15:30]  There it goes.  I'll go with, uh...  Oh, man.  Stop looking at Steve to see what he's doing.  I know.  Stop it.  I'm looking at his poker face.  You poker face.  Blonde-haired vixen.  Come on.  All right, sex.  Murder.  Yeah!  That's right.  Murder.  Trapes on into the basement.  One girl in sleeping bag being used to beat another girl in a sleeping bag to death.  Oh!  That's great. 
[03:16:00]  Five or fifty?  Yeah.  The music would have thrown you, yeah.  The ow led me to believe it was sex because, you know, what girl getting murdered is going  to go, ow?  I'm so out.  Ouch.  All right.  Jimmy and Anthony tied for the lead.  One clip to go, hopefully.  All right.  All right.  Here's the last clip.  Tiebreaker.  Coming or going?  Oh!  Oh, my God.  I shoved it right in my fucking ass.  Holy shit.  That's it.  Fucking ass. 
[03:16:30]  Looks like this game's going to end in a tie.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  It's definitely murder.  Yeah.  Because he's putting the knife in her chest and she figures if he puts it in her ass, she  won't die.  She'll be able to get to the hospital.  You figured it all out.  Put that knife in my ass when you're done.  That's where I usually keep it.  That's something.  That was a gimme.  Well, all right.  I guess this game ends in a tie.  Ends in a tie.  I do want to hear that again, though.  Yeah, me too.  Oh, my God.  He shoved it right in my fucking ass. 
[03:17:00]  Holy shit.  That's it.  Fucking ass.  Oh, that's a good one.  We take a break because I'm going to urinate in my pants.  I know.  We just talked for 35 minutes.  35.  We just talked for an hour and a half.  Matt from Jersey.  Really fast because we do have to take a break.  All right.  I've got a suggestion for the next time you play this game.  Okay.  Instead of having girls getting killed, have them taking giant shits.  You could even change the name to Humper Dump.  Humper Dump.  I like that.  God, that is a great idea.  This way, we win either way because it's hot no matter what she's doing. 
[03:17:30]  Exactly.  Where are we going to get the girls dumping, though?  Thank you.  I think I can help.  Eventually, you're going to get girls calling the show.  They'll be willing to take a shit.  Steve, you want to maybe get girls and-  Get on that, Steve.  I delegate this to Jim.  He's the one that gets off on that.  Unless I get off on that.  No interest in watching girls take shit.  Yeah, me neither.  That's awful.  But get on it.  Get those clips for the show.  What, do you have interest in watching girls get murdered?  You sociopath?  Our listeners are brilliant, though.  Someone out there will go, dude, it's easy. 
[03:18:00]  There's a tape called blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Get Caviar Party 3.  Not quite what Caviar Party 1 and 2 are, but yeah.  Humper Dump, okay.  Humper Dump, I love that.  It's not a bad idea.  I like that.  That was a little long, but that was kind of fun.  Very good, Steve.  Steve worked really hard on that, so.  Very good.  Ooh, someone's getting a phone call.  Could be an opportunity.  All right, as we go to break, I found the Bill phone call.  We just called the Bill phone call.  Bill!  Basically, um-  This is awful.  This is, um, a lady. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah.  An older lady that called our show, but she called the wrong number.  She mis-dialed.  We used to get a lot of wrong numbers, and whenever we did, we just, uh, went with it.  Threw it on the air, and kind of screwed with the people.  This is horrific.  When we come back, we'll talk to Stalker Patty.  Hello!  Hi.  Hi.  Bill.  Who's this?  Pat.  Hi, Pat.  How are you?  No, this is the wrong Bill.  Uh, well, Pat, I have some bad news.  What?  Uh, Bill-  Uh, uh, Bill died today. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah, kid-  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Tragic.  Who's this?  He was in a car accident today.  Oh, no.  Who is this?  John.  John?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  I don't believe it.  Yeah.  I was just talking to him. 
[03:19:30]  I know.  Where did it happen?  Uh, this afternoon.  Where?  On the highway.  Oh, God love him.  Yeah, big, big, big pileup.  Well, be sure and give the kids my condolences.  Okay.  Well, I gotta go.  All right, John. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  For seven cents a day, you can get Opie and Anthony.  Or feed this little kid with the flies on his face.  But you want to laugh, don't you?  You don't want to be depressed watching starving children.  So turn them off and turn on Opie and Anthony.  And we'll send you a photo of the child you're helping in the outfit of your choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I had an uncle that went crazy.  Crazy, man.  Everybody's got a crazy uncle.  He's usually your favorite uncle when you're a kid, too. 
[03:20:30]  You don't realize he's crazy until you're about 15.  No wonder Bobby was so much fun.  He's out of his fucking mind.  My uncle Bobby lost his mind.  You know what people do when they lose their mind?  They start repeating shit that don't mean nothing.  Every time you ask Bobby a question, you answer it the same way.  Bobby, what time is it?  If you want to feel funky, feel free. 
[03:21:00]  Please don't spread that funk on me.  What did that mean?  I'll never know.  You know what cartoon I used to hate when I was a kid?  Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids.  It's like the most racist, most degrading cartoon in the history of television.  I actually had a guy walking around with a damn hat pulled over his head. 
[03:21:30]  And another guy going, weep or go between the store.  My name is Babelba.  It's like, hey, hey, hey, I'm illiterate.  Egg rinse.  Hi, my name is Debbie Ellis.  Can I help you? 
[03:22:00]  Yes, I'm looking to fill a permanent position.  Certainly.  Now, what kind of position are you looking for?  I'm looking to fill doggy style is the position.  What is that?  Doggy style.  I beg your pardon?  Doggy style.  Which means?  Which means, you know, in the rear.  Log on.  Listen up.  XM introduces its premium online music service.

Coming up on Sunday is segment number six, the Mutual Admiration Society, as Quincy extends  his relationship with Michael Jackson for two more historic albums, Sunday, 7 p.m.  East and 4 in the West, on XM Live, Channel 200 and Sweet 62.  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive fiction? 
[03:23:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Amen.  Stalker Patty outside the studio. 
[03:24:00]  Ugh.  So far, all the old characters have bombed horribly on our new radio show here at XM Satellite Radio.  We'll give her a shot.  Stalker Patty is a real-life stalker that we invited to just kind of hang out with us.  Did she bring anything?  Because last I heard, she had something for us.  She's always bringing us gifts.  Or at least she was when we were on the air. 
[03:24:30]  She's always bringing, like, gifts.  No gifts.  Nothing?  Nothing.  Okay.  She didn't bring anything besides, obviously, not conditioner.  Jesus.  Don't smoke next to that hairdo.  We've shaved Patty's hair twice.  Just before we got fired about two years ago.  Yeah.  We shaved it down and gave her a wig, and then we took the wig.  No, you had the wig taken, not we.  No, we did.  No.  Yeah, it was Opie, Anthony, and Jim.  No, Anthony hid behind the console.  No.  Norton hid under it, and Opie encouraged it. 
[03:25:00]  No, we took the wig.  Right, Ant?  I do remember you yelling, take the wig, take the wig.  Yeah.  Well, it was WNEW property, and we took the wig away from her and left her pretty much bald on the streets of New York.  I forgot that was your excuse.  What, no.  That station property, take the wig.  No, you guys were in on the meeting, right?  I don't remember that part of it.  We've talked about a lot of old things today on the radio show, and especially for the, well, not especially for the truckers, because they don't have a lot of internet access on the highways. 
[03:25:30]  But I guess to the new listeners of XM Satellite Radio, or the ONA show on XM Satellite Radio, OAVirus.com.  FedEx is paying attention.  When we talk about these old bits, he finds them and puts them up on OAVirus.com.  Oh, very good.  So I'm sure he'll have the take the wig thing, and the-  That's already up there.  Oh, it is?  Yeah, I heard that.  So the puke fest we did for the Super Bowl tickets, you think we could get a pair of tickets for the World Series?  Working on it.  Yeah, we have to bring back the puke fest, too.  Have to. 
[03:26:00]  Okay?  Right.  All right.  You want to watch the World Series?  We didn't do any news today, guys.  Oh.  What?  There's nothing really in the news.  I mean, the big story, you know, the-  Yeah, we talked about-  Red Sox did the impossible.  We talked about that for an hour.  Miss America pageant off the air.  Yeah, it was on that.  Due to bad ratings.  ABC, I guess, dropped it.  Yeah.  And now it's looking for a new television home.  Well, there's no real reason to ever watch that.  There used to be before the internet and all that stuff. 
[03:26:30]  You know, you get a cheap thrill checking out these girls and their one pieces.  It's just awful now.  Yeah, when you used to watch it, you were just waiting for the bikini competition where  they'd come out in their swimsuits.  And you get a little thrill.  You're like, oh, that girl's got nice cans or nice ass or something like that.  But yeah, now you can just go on the internet and get whatever you want.  Are they allowed to wear bikinis yet?  Every year they try to-  No, they wear bikinis still.  Oh, they do?  But every year, some group, like now or something, tries to get them to stop doing that. 
[03:27:00]  It's degrading.  It is showing women as objects, and we must stop them from parading around in bikinis  on stage.  That was the only reason anyone was even watching it in the first place.  We weren't watching to listen to what they had to say.  Yeah, or the talent competition.  Look, she's riding a unicycle and she juggles.  Who wants to see hot girls doing stupid things like that?  You know what?  They're not even that hot. 
[03:27:30]  No, they look a lot older than they are.  They're not that hot.  They're made up like Midwestern housewives.  They look plastic.  Yeah.  They look all fake.  You know why you don't want to watch Miss America?  Because now you can see them doing what it is they should be doing in a little film called  Throat Yogurt.  That's what the talent portion should have shown.  Throat Yogurt.  Yeah.  Just them going, blah, blah, with little crowns on their stupid heads.  Hey, and the judges are scoring that now.  Wow. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, so they're looking for a new home.  Yeah.  Nobody wants to see that awful, trite competition.  Nobody.  It's not funny.  It's not interesting.  They're not insightful.  No, that's why they can't find a home.  What it is is like 50s to early 60s entertainment.  Yes.  It's that stuff they all, you know, all ma and pa and the kids would gather around the  television and watch the Miss America competition because there was nothing else on television.  And that was it. 
[03:28:30]  You know, you had to.  Pretty much had to.  And the little fellow would sit there with a tent in his little pants.  Yeah.  Not too sure of what it was.  His little corduroys tenting.  I mean, dad would be looking at mom, wondering how he could kill her and cover it up because  of the fatso she turned into.  So the Miss America pageant meant something for the whole family.  You're right.  You are.  60s.  Both me and Anthony's Hot Tee News.  Ah, yes, Anthony.  This just in.  Hot Tee News update.  Here's the news we need to know. 
[03:29:00]  Recory coach suspended after topless swimming incidents.  What?  We go to Minnesota for this story.  The head girl swimming and diving coach at the high school suspended while administrators  investigate what happened when several members of the team swam topless at a practice.  This is Hot Tee News.  It's about time we get actual Hot Tee News during the Hot Tee News segment of the Opie  and Anthony show.  Laura Molinari, who remains suspended Friday, described the incident as a prank and she 
[03:29:30]  didn't know about it beforehand.  Female swim coach.  Molinari is in her first season as the Spartans head coach after serving as an assistant.  She's also a full-time nursing student, Anthony, at the state university.  A lot of female coaches are lesbians.  You've got to get your lesbian gym teacher whistle, by the way.  Something else we need for the brand new Opie and Anthony show.  Recory activities director, blah, blah, said Molinari's future with the school is under 
[03:30:00]  investigation because it hasn't been completed yet.  But I guess basically Molinari said the incident happened on what she called Two Piece Tuesday.  Two Piece Tuesday.  What, she doing her own wacky radio show?  Well, you know, we were just talking about, you know, they wear the one piece on the  Mrs. America pageant.  I guess, you know, when you're the swimmers, they do wear the one piece.  But this lesbian gym teacher, I'm still with you now, decided, hey girls, you get to wear  a two-piece bathing suit today. 
[03:30:30]  It's really brilliant, Debra.  For practice.  And where is this Molinari?  What school?  Minnesota, somewhere in Minnesota.  Was it a high school?  Oh, of course.  It wouldn't be part of the Teen News segment, Anthony.  Oh, that's great.  So hot.  High school girls topless in the pool.  The girls just...  Frolicking and splashing each other.  Muff-munching Monday.  The girls decided to play a prank and swim topless, she said.  There's really not much I could say about this.  It was a swimming prank that got out of hand.  I had no prior knowledge that the girls would go topless. 
[03:31:00]  Topless teens in the pool.  Molinari said the entire teen did not participate.  She would not say whether she confessed...  See, unfortunately, the last part of the story is cut off here.  So fill in the blank.  She would not say whether she...  Joined in.  Joined in.  Yeah.  About the...  All right, yeah, that makes...  Oh.  Administrators about the incident or if they brought the issue to her.  So we have to fill in the blank.  It says, she would not say whether she... 
[03:31:30]  And then it continues, administrators about the incident or if they brought the issue  to her.  Hmm.  She would not say if she...  Brought the attention...  Brought to the attention of the administrators.  Like, did she rat them out or did somebody come and go, hey, how come you didn't say  anything about this?  Just sat there with your mullet dry-humping the diving board.  She would not say if she sniffed high school muff.  Could that have been the sentence that's left out?  And then Molinari, the gym teacher, she says, it really wasn't that big of an issue. 
[03:32:00]  The situation was dealt with within minutes.  Yeah.  Not that big an issue.  After she got the peak.  Of course.  Details of what happened.  Two-piece Tuesday.  I love that.  Isn't that great?  And they're still trying to get more details.  Yes.  Of the incident, Anthony.  Will we be doing a follow-up on that story on Hot Teen News?  Well, I do have a follow-up to the other teen story from the other day.  It had a happy ending, Anthony.  Remember the runaways that...  Wait, I'm confused.  Are we still in the segment to Hot Teen News? 
[03:32:30]  Oh, okay.  Why?  I didn't know.  I thought you were going...  Oh, okay.  The infant's Hot Teen News.  Yes, Anthony.  We got a teen update from a story we brought you a couple days ago.  A young Oklahoma girl told The Post yesterday she and her friend stole a parent's car  and drove all the way to New York with just enough money for gas, tolls, and peanut butter  crackers because we just wanted to see what it was like to be in New York City.  Nice.  It's way different from what we expected, said Skylar 14.  Whoa.  Who turned up safe and sound in the Big Apple with her pal Brittany 13. 
[03:33:00]  Thelma and Louise with wispy pubic hair.  That's right.  The Thelma and Louise duo who took off Friday, leaving their folks terrified and setting off  police searches in every state between Oklahoma and New York, insisted they hit the road  on a whim.  But their parents and police said the bizarre road trip was sparked by a date one of the  girls made with a guy she met on the internet.  Yay.  And the man turned them in when he learned their ages.  Oh, smart fella.  The youngsters said they took turns driving, slept in the car in hotel parking lots, and 
[03:33:30]  ate only the crackers and a Snickers bar.  That wasn't a Snickers bar.  That was Tyrone.  Oh.  That old gag.  Brittany said they ditched her mom's 1999 Nissan in Manhattan when they ran out of gas and  money.  We made pretty good time, Skylar said.  It gets great gas mileage.  Cops said the girls were turned in Monday night by a 19-year-old man.  No arrests have been made.  They said there wasn't a man involved, said one cop.  But Skylar's mother, Melanie, said cops told her the girls had placed a call to a friend 
[03:34:00]  in Oklahoma from a Manhattan phone.  The Oklahoma friend retrieved the number from caller ID, called back, and answered, the  mom said.  The friend then, can't read the rest of the story because something's wrong with our printer.  Whacked out a batch thinking of the two girls in New York with a guy in a room.  Well, we can play fill in the blank again, sure.  The friend then, blank, blank, blank, called the police.  Put it in both of their hineys, pretended he thought they were 18, then called the police.  All right.  Very good.  The guy said he didn't want any trouble. 
[03:34:30]  I think they told him they were old, blank, blank, blank.  Enough to suck any cock.  I think they told him they were old, blank, blank, blank, showed up with her stuffed animals.  Old enough to tie their own shoes and showed up with her stuffed animals.  And then he said, you know, to this guy's credit, it was obvious she wasn't 18 years old.  Obvious.  Even though her mother promised to put, blank, blank, blank, bowl duty. 
[03:35:00]  What?  Yeah.  Even though her mother promised to put, blank, blank, blank, bowl duty, when she gets back  home, Skylar enjoyed her New York experience.  Ex-lax in the food because she was on.  Very good.  Okay.  I'll accept that.  Except for bad drivers, they had a lot of fun in New York City.  It's crazy, Skylar said.  They need some, blank, blank, blank.  That's how the story ends.  Of course.  Comedian mule in their mouth. 
[03:35:30]  So there's your hot teen news update.  Update.  That was a happy ending to us.  Well, I'm glad to see they're all safe and sound.  I know.  Yes, Ben?  Oh, you were just okay.  Oh, I thought we were going to go to the weather with Ben.  The weather.  All right.  Want to bring Stalker Patty in here?  Yeah, let's bring her in.  All right.  Yeah, let's see.  Like Opie said before, everyone from the old show that has come back and has joined us  on this brand new program we're doing has sucked, has just stunk up the joint. 
[03:36:00]  Really fast.  Jerry Lee Lewis from whackbag.com.  A great Opie and Anthony message board.  Yes.  Writing us from Charlotte.  Cool.  Have you guys seen the latest bid on the Oompa Loompa autographed t-shirt on eBay?  Oh, what's it up to?  It's up to $212.50.  Wow.  $212.50.  The intern came in and got us all Oompa Loompa t-shirts.  We signed one because the guy put his own money out there and we figured he could get  some of his money back.  So we put it up on eBay and the bid's up to, yes, $212.  Wow.  And fast.  Real fast.  Doughboy also from whackbag.com. 
[03:36:30]  I love it.  The sweet, innocent Indian lady decides to come over and inquire about my XM radio just  as this bit is going on, the coming or going.  Oh.  Talk about cringe in the workplace.  All right.  Hi, Patty.  How are you?  I'm fine.  How are you?  Very, very good.  Well, there you go.  You're back on the show.  Hi.  Isn't that something?  I thought someone had said you had some kind of a present for us.  What happened?  No.  Someone had said you had, like, because you always bring a present, whether it's Opie's 
[03:37:00]  birthday, Valentine's Day, Christmas, you've always brought presents, whether it's a landmark  or a year anniversary on a station.  And I assume since we're brand new here that you would have brought a gift for us saying,  hey, welcome back to radio.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yes, you are.  I've noticed that you still don't wear bras there, Patty, huh?  Well, I don't have anything to hold them up.  She's got Gilda Radner. 
[03:37:30]  Ratner.  Jesus.  You're right.  Gilda Radner ovaries.  Well, small is beautiful.  Well, her boobs are as big as an ovary, yes.  Well, small is beautiful.  Patty, a couple of questions for you.  It's been a couple of years since we've been on the air and had you on the air.  So it has.  You were, how old are you now?  49.  49.  Oh, my God.  We've been off the air a while.  She was a 47-year-old virgin when we left the airwaves. 
[03:38:00]  Patty, are you still a virgin at 49 years old?  I don't know if it's good or bad, but yes, unfortunately or fortunately, I don't know.  How does this sound for a contest, Opie?  Fucked by 50.  How does that sound?  Are you up for it?  Well, let me tell you.  Before your 50th birthday?  You know, it would be nice.  Have you held one in your mouth a little?  No, I don't do things like that.  No. 
[03:38:30]  What, have fun?  Oh, these are the questions we couldn't ask.  Things like that.  These are the questions we couldn't ask on the old show.  True.  Patty, how far have you gone with the guy?  Yeah.  This used to take 10 minutes to try to, like, get it into code.  Work between the lines.  How far have you gone with the guy?  Was it when Ron Jeremy was fingering you to try to find the...  Hopefully, that's about it.  When you had Ron Jeremy's dick in your hand, when you were searching for U2 tickets that  we shoved down his pants?  You touched his hog.  I don't know how we got away with that. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, how did we get away with that?  I don't know, but that was a miracle.  That was wacky.  Well, I did get to see my favorite band.  Oh.  You too.  Ron Jeremy's penis?  No.  You too.  She's a big...  Yes, Ben?  Remember how Patty won the tickets and Earl screwed up and Patty ended up sitting next  to you and you were so pissed?  Oh, that's right.  I want to see you too.  We go to the garden.  What was it?  The garden?  Yeah.  And I find out at the last minute that Patty's tickets were the ones right next to mine. 
[03:39:30]  So every two seconds, they sound really good.  Yes, Patty, they do.  So shut up so I could listen to them.  I didn't talk that much.  I talked mostly to my friend.  Patty, you've had to have had some kind of sexual experiences when you were younger,  growing up.  Actually, no.  It was just the way I was brought up by overly strict Catholic parents who would threaten  bodily harm.  Who are they?  Mary and Joseph? 
[03:40:00]  Jesus Christ.  They could have been.  They may as well have been.  You've never been abused in any of those homes you were living in?  You were a foundling.  Were you at the foundling shelter?  Well, you know, you get beatings and stuff like that, or your hair pooled and stuff,  you know.  At the foundling shelter?  Your hair pooled?  I want to show you.  My mother's hair pooled in my hair.  What do you eat by there, by the way, Hope?  Yogurt.  Ah, good.  Yes, thank you.  I want to show you why God has a sense of humor.  Yeah.  This proves right here that God has a sense of humor. 
[03:40:30]  Paris Hilton.  This isn't Paris Hilton.  No, that's Tara Reade.  What am I, Tara Reade?  No, some whore.  Sex Bagel brings in hot pictures for us every morning to give us a little motivation.  Tara Reade's got weird hips.  Look.  Jesus, Ant.  She goes straight down on the sides.  Look, it's weird looking.  But this proves that God has a sense of humor, because, you know, you mix that DNA one way  and look what happens.  Look at that.  This is a beautiful picture, and then you mix it another way, and you get the fine mess that  we're currently staring at.  Patty, do you enjoy eating throat yogurt? 
[03:41:00]  What?  I do eat yogurt.  I love it.  It's one of my favorite foods, because I don't like meat.  How does it feel?  Could you eat yogurt with hands holding your hair?  I'm trying to work.  I'm trying to bridge.  What would you call the bridge?  A bridge?  Yeah, from one reality to another.  How do you eat yogurt with your hands holding your hair?  Well, basically-  Someone feeds it to you.  Yeah.  They feed you the yogurt, and they want to make sure you get every last drop so they  hold your hair.  Yes.  They hold your hair.  No.  Because you don't really want to get the yogurt in your hair. 
[03:41:30]  You know what I mean?  No.  Maybe they shine shoes for a living just because their hands and arms are dark-colored, holding  your hair, forcing some yogurt down your throat.  Some throat yogurt.  No.  No, I feed myself.  Nobody feeds me.  No, huh?  Good.  I'm very independent.  I'll say you are.  Ugh.  All right.  50 years old.  When is your birthday?  June 4th.  All right.  So we have a long time to go.  No, it's not that long. 
[03:42:00]  It's like seven months.  50.  Wow.  You look younger than 50.  She's a virgin at 50.  Well, I know.  That's the only thing I'm happy about is I do look younger than 50.  It doesn't do any good, though.  Nobody's getting in there.  What's the use of looking young?  Maybe when you look in a funhouse mirror.  Well, somebody once told me that, you know, it could happen sooner or later with me, probably  later.  You know.  So what are you looking for, though?  A relationship?  What are you waiting for?  Well, first of all, I got to meet somebody. 
[03:42:30]  But most of the people who have asked me out are only in their 20s.  I don't want to look like Cher.  I think she's ridiculous.  You won't.  I don't think you have to worry about that.  Gypsy's tramps and retards.  Any guy that would have himself called a toy boy has nuts in their heads.  You know, something wrong with them.  That's what you need, nuts in your head.  Yeah, you definitely need nuts in your head.  You don't look like Cher.  Don't worry about it.  What are you holding out for?  Maybe if she had AIDS.  No.  No one's going to believe that you're Cher.  Oh, I know that, but I don't want to be like her.  I think you look more like Demi Moore. 
[03:43:00]  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, even she's ridiculous going out with a kid that's not much older than her own kids.  Of course, because every woman out there that's in her 40s, that's disgusting going out with Ashton.  You know, any woman out there wouldn't want a young buck giving her the old meat knob.  No, they hate that.  They do.  It's silly.  Patty, can we have someone F you for World Series tickets?  Let's get right to the point.  Can we do that?  F me?  I don't know. 
[03:43:30]  Come on.  You need a good tooling.  Do you still get your period?  Yes.  Or did you go through menopause?  Yeah, I still get it.  You do?  But I don't know.  I've got to go see a gynecologist.  What do you mean?  Why?  When was the last time you saw a gynecologist?  I don't know.  About 15 years ago, and a guy scared the shit out of me, and I almost ran out of there.  What did he do that scared you?  He was very rough and everything.  I don't know.  I would rather be examined by a woman who understands a woman's body.  I don't like men gynecologists.  It was a man gynecologist? 
[03:44:00]  You know what?  He was rough because he was blindfolded.  He didn't want to look down there.  No.  He was trying to feel his way around.  But I do want to go.  I want to get the bone density, everything, the full workup.  I want to know what kind of shape I'm doing.  We want you to get the bone density, too.  Yeah.  He probably felt it.  He couldn't believe that was a female vagina.  He's like, what is this, the back of a piggy bank?  But I will tell you one thing.  When I had my feet surgery, they had to break my foot and reset it.  They had a very hard time doing that, and it's suggested that I had a very young bone age. 
[03:44:30]  Do you know that could be the worst thing I've ever heard?  I've never heard anybody say anything as awful as that.  If I have a very young bone age.  Very young bone age.  Well, it means I'm not going to have osteoporosis.  I don't think I would say anything like that.  You already look like you do.  You really do.  I do.  You have a body like a lima bean.  Well, I'm thin.  What can I say?  I'm 110 pounds.  Patty.  You're an oval.  You're a thin oval.  Patty, what sent you to the gyno last time you went?  Just curiosity, you know, just for regular exam.  Regular exam.  And what made you pick a guy? 
[03:45:00]  That's all that's our gynecologist.  No, there's plenty of female gynos out there.  Yeah, and they all have big long waiting lists, too.  Oh, because girls don't want to go to a guy.  So you go to the guy, and did he put in that metal thing that spreads you apart?  Actually, yes.  And it was very painful.  It hurt.  And that was the part that scared me.  And then he didn't tell me what was happening beforehand.  Well, he assumed that a woman in her fucking 30s and 40s that come into the office had been to a gyno and knew what one of those things were. 
[03:45:30]  No, I was very naive.  What do you think he was doing?  You know, and then when I was in college, I got mixed up with a religious group and stuff, you know?  So it was like.  Unfortunately, it wasn't Heaven's Gate.  No.  Oh, you really should be wearing Adidas.  I only have one health problem, and that's it, and it's not so bad.  It's asthma.  Oh, you got asthma?  Yeah, I'm treated for that. 
[03:46:00]  You know, but that's about it.  It's my only health problem.  So he tried to stretch that clam of yours, and you had a problem with that?  Yeah.  Did you tell him at the point you were a virgin?  I don't know.  I tried to, but he was like a little weird.  But he had a dick in my mouth.  No, it was like a little weird, so I was glad to get out of there.  I was like, I don't want to continue this goodbye.  And I'm sure he was happy to see you go.  He wanted to make sure you never came back.  Wow, man.  Oh, very funny.  That must be a horror scene, though, her walking in there not knowing anything, and 
[03:46:30]  them taking that speculum out and shoving it in there, and her not knowing?  What a comedy act that is.  Before I see a gynecologist, they got to tell me everything from beginning to end, what's  going on, and why they're doing it.  What's going on?  I'm going to look for cancer in your snatch.  That's pretty much what is going on.  There's pretty much nothing else going on.  They got to tell me exactly how they're doing it, and why, and stuff like that.  You want to get a gyno for it?  Yeah, we really, we got to get a gyno for you.  I'm a little worried about you, Patty.  You've been a friend of the show for a very long time. 
[03:47:00]  I do believe we need to get a gynecologist to come on the program.  We'll do the examination right here in the studio.  Get a pap smear.  Yes.  You need a pap smear, Patty.  Yes.  You need a pap smear.  How do you feel about that?  You might have cancer.  You've got to check for anal warts.  Oh, I don't think I have cancer.  I can promise you that.  How can you promise?  You don't know.  There she goes.  I don't.  Professional diagnosis.  Self-diagnosis.  There's anything else going on down there that would disturb the  cancer while it was growing.  Cancer could take its time and develop slowly. 
[03:47:30]  Nothing else going on.  I'm going to hang out in here.  It's not a busy place.  Pretty quiet.  I like it.  I like the atmosphere.  Why isn't anyone coming to get me?  Your snatch is where cancer goes to retire.  It's just like, hey, I could sit by the pool.  No one bothers me.  It's wonderful.  We sit.  A couple of friends come over.  It's quiet.  You funny.  On Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous Cancer, they feature your vagina as a  hideaway. 
[03:48:00]  This palatial vagina.  Never been disturbed.  That's pretty messed up there, Patty.  Yeah.  You've got to pretty much check that thing out.  A lot of stuff can happen in there.  So can we get you laid or what?  For your 50th birthday?  We have a lot of truckers.  50 years old.  Yeah.  One of them will come in here and do it.  Well, first of all, I'm a lady.  I'm not a...  You talk by that voice.  She's a lady. 
[03:48:30]  I am.  Yeah.  I'm a lady.  She'll lay on her back and not let you touch her crack.  Even ladies like to get laid, though.  Exactly.  Yeah, I know, but it's...  Patty, you ever take care of yourself?  Yes, I do take care of...  What do you mean by that?  What do you mean by that?  See, you've got to word everything.  Look how naive she is.  She probably thinks, yes, I have good hygiene and I take care of myself.  I brush...  I guess you mean a little bit more than taking a shower of the night.  Yes, Patty, what I mean is, have you ever brought yourself to orgasm? 
[03:49:00]  Do you know what it's like to feel an orgasm rage through your body?  Yes.  I don't think so.  No?  Well, I mean, I see movies and stuff like that.  But you haven't felt it yourself?  You haven't taken your own hand and worked your area?  Have you?  Have you touched yourself?  The little thing down there that looks like a knuckle.  When I think about you, what such myself, oh, I don't want... 
[03:49:30]  No?  Anything?  I just watch the television.  You've been curious.  Your hand wanders down there a little bit, right?  You grab your cock.  I don't have one.  Thank you, Anthony, but I don't have one of those.  I mean, you just, you've toyed with yourself?  I don't know.  You just, you're, you're, the way you're reacting is a little embarrassed, so you probably have.  Yeah.  And you're just, you gotta get that whole religious thing out of your head. 
[03:50:00]  It's not dirty.  What happened when you tried it?  Obviously, you tried it, and something made you uncomfortable.  Jesus was watching me, so I had to stay up.  Huh?  Was God mad at you?  No.  Do you ever do it by accident?  Like, you're sitting there watching TV, your little legs are rubbing together, like, just  kind of casually, and all of a sudden you realize it feels good?  Well, the only time I get any sensation like this, three days after my fairy is about it.  What are you doing when you get this?  Oh, God.  What are you doing when you get this?  That's the clumps bumping up against it on the way out. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, God, Opie.  Oh, wow.  It's like a clot log film.  But that's fun.  Your vagina is action park for period clots.  Yuck.  Oh, Jesus.  What is that in your vagina?  A jelly donut?  Why aren't you sopping private piles clots up?  Ugh.  Wow.  So you get a little worked up. 
[03:51:00]  A little sensation, huh?  A little sensation.  What do you use as far as feminine hygiene products?  Do you use a pad or a tampon?  Probably a Q-tip.  Banaka.  It burns.  Do you use a pad or a...  You use a tampon, so you put that in.  Well, yeah, because it's cleaner.  Well, of course it is.  We all know that.  I use belts and clips and pads.  No.  When I was 14, I did because that was the time. 
[03:51:30]  Sure.  Really?  When you were in the shower at school and they started throwing tampons at you?  No.  Can we set up a gyno appointment for you?  That is important, Patty, for health reasons.  Well, I had been planning for some time.  I do have health insurance now for my job, so I keep doing it.  And that job is?  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  Good day.  She works at the chocolate factory.  Oompa.  Oompa.  No Oompa Loompas over there?  No.  We got one here.  I know.  You ought to take them to work with you. 
[03:52:00]  Everybody basically gets along at work.  I do have the ordering in the stores.  Let's say hi to Henri.  Henri.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Pretty good.  This is Henri.  This is the guy trying to become the new Frenchie.  Yeah.  And the Frenchie's fast asleep, so I guess we'll have to go with Henri.  I am the new Frenchie.  Can we get the pig off the air, please?  You don't like the stalker, Patty?  No.  Listen to this pig.  She doesn't even know what she's laughing at.  You're making fun of her.  She laughs at her.  She has no idea.  She should stalk a suicide machine. 
[03:52:30]  No.  Fucking pig.  No wonder you're a virgin.  Your voice turns men's dicks into vaginas.  Listen to you.  All right.  Hey, I like the new Frenchie.  I'm digging the new Frenchie.  The Frenchie making a comeback here.  This is a mess.  I'm glad this show's almost over.  Seriously.  This is great.  It's like we have a new Darren Tate.  Right, right, right.  Like when they traded Dick Sargent for Dick York.  Or Dick York for Dick Sargent.  And no one noticed.  And no one noticed.  They were kind of similar and everything.  This is the same thing with Frenchie.  I like it.  We pulled the old switch the character around and hope they didn't notice. 
[03:53:00]  All right.  And it's working perfectly.  Andre.  Yes.  Anything else?  No, I just want to tell her she's a pig.  And I think Norton should have sex with her to give her herpes.  And that's it.  I'm actually, sir, you know, it's funny you should say that.  I'm the first man to ever touch those nugget-like bosoms.  Oh, that's right.  You did feel her up.  My first O&A appearance.  Wow.  That's right.  They asked me to touch the breasts of Stoke.  And it was also, who was the old lady that was on?  Irene.  No, no.  Not Irene. 
[03:53:30]  She was the one who just stood there idly while her loved one died on a bathroom floor.  Was it the piano woman?  She had a weird name.  No, not Sandy Kane.  She had a weird name.  The piano player.  Like Truckin' Frank.  Not like that, but it was like an adjective before the name.  We'll have to find it online.  I'm sure we will.  I felt you up on that show.  I felt your hair blossoming nipples.  What did they feel like?  Were they soft?  I didn't.  Who remembered?  I blocked it out like a childhood ring.  It felt like an orangutan.  Blocked it out like a childhood ring. 
[03:54:00]  It was awful.  She leaped around the room wearing duct-taped diapers.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Um.  All right.  Let's say hi to you.  Frantic Fran.  Frantic Fran.  Frantic Fran.  If I ever blurt something that unimportant out so happily, smack my fat face.  You were so happy you thought of it.  Frantic Fran.  No one cares already.  All right.  Wild, what's up?  Hey.  New trucker contest.  Your first contest.  And so late to truck drivers.  Who wants to fuck Patty?  We can get one of them to do it.  What do you think, Patty?  We find you a trucker.  What kind of guy do you want to F you? 
[03:54:30]  I don't know.  Someone I've known for a while that I'm...  You know, intimate with...  I'm not that kind of a lady.  What kind of a lady?  I'm not...  A human one?  One that is sexually active before she's 50 years old?  Andy, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Great to have you guys back, man.  All right.  Hey, listen.  I'll take a step up.  I'll take a swing at the plate, man.  I'll fuck her before she's 50.  He sounds like a nice guy.  Yeah.  Patty?  That's not intimate. 
[03:55:00]  What is?  Andy, what could you offer Stalker Patty?  What can I offer Stalker Patty?  I don't know.  Good heart sex.  Good clean eating.  What do you want me to tell you?  I'm 27.  You know.  Blonde hair.  Blue eyes.  Stocky.  5'10".  All right.  Calm down.  Norton's getting excited.  Yeah.  Norton can whack off to me.  I don't care.  I'm a good guy like that.  Really?  You're a good sport?  Two men.  Why not?  Why not?  No one can play with himself looking at me.  I'm a good guy like that.  All right, Andy.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Why does Stalker Patty look horrified?  She's a virgin.  How about if we get you an Asian?  How about that?  You'll never know what he's thinking by looking at his face. 
[03:55:30]  You'll think it's like an alien.  How about when you won't even feel it?  How about we try the drill dough on you?  Oh.  That could be fun.  I'd love to do that.  Have you used any tools?  Anything like a sex toy, Patty?  Let me tell you.  Every year I go to the...  This is the warning music.  We just started this today.  Every year I go to a Christmas party.  It's two minutes.  Two minutes to go, yes.  Until the show ends.  And one year the guy gave me a gift and it was a...  What was it? 
[03:56:00]  A dildo?  A vibrator.  A vibrator?  He says, what am I going to do with that?  He says, oh, sometimes it's good to be good, but it's good to be naughty.  Was that Bill O'Reilly that gave that to you?  No.  No?  I thought it might have been Bill O'Reilly.  No.  Bill O'Reilly did not come to the Christmas party.  Okay.  So did you use the vibrator?  It's still in my bathroom.  I haven't used it.  It's still in my bathroom.  Every time she walks in, the vibrator breaks out into a sweat.  Oh, please God, don't let it be today.  Not today.  Not today.  Let her just think I'm a non-working toothbrush, this idiot. 
[03:56:30]  I mean, it was one of those goofy gifts that people give to each other, sense of humor.  Yeah.  No, you should use it.  What did this vibrator look like?  It was just regular.  It was just, you know.  Was it penis shaped or was it shaped like a cylinder?  Cylinder.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Oh, now we've got to wrap up soon.  This is at the end.  I'm starting to sweat.  Oh, geez.  We've got to get all this in.  Come on, jump.  Go, go, miss.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Which show is this from?  It's Mario Brothers. 
[03:57:00]  It's a game.  Something you know nothing of.  I don't know that.  So what did this vibrator look like?  I think we only have like 30 seconds left.  Oh, it was bright neon yellow and long.  I'm like, you're giving me this?  Okay.  You know?  What do you like?  All right.  Patty, very good.  I think Stalker Patty did well on our first visit on the new Opie and Anthony show.  Pretty good.  It was hot.  It was interesting.  Not bad.  So what are we going to do to you next?  Can we get you a gyno appointment?  We'll do it live in the studio.  You know, we'll have sheets up and stuff because no one wants to really see anything.  Nobody wants to see your cicada box. 
[03:57:30]  What do you say?  All right.  If there's gynecologists out there, please email Ben.  His email address is up on opieandanthony.com, okay?  Thank you, Stalker Patty, for stopping on by.  Oh, we're done.  Oh, no.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  Aw, it's so cute.  Whoopsie-daisy.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Asses like 10-year-old boys.  Customer service. 
[03:58:00]  May I help you?  Yes, I need the location for where I can ship a package.  Yeah, where are you calling from?  Knoxville, please.  What?  Knoxville.  Oh, yeah.  How much does it weigh?  I don't know.  That's why I need to take it somewhere.  You don't know.  How am I supposed to track how much it's going to cost?  You don't know how much it weighs.  What's the matter with you?  Sir, I just wanted to know if there was a service center in Knoxville that I could go to. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, but I told you I need to know how much your package was.  I need to know the dimensions before I can tell you how much it's going to cost you.  You people calling up.  I need that information.  Sir, how am I supposed to know how much?  If you would just shut up and let me explain to you, I need to know.  Excuse me?  Let me explain.  You just calm your ass down, young lady. 
[03:59:00]  You work for ***, yes, sir?  Yeah, give me the dimensions of your package so I can hurry up and take another call.  I've been here since 8 o'clock this morning.  Sir, I cannot believe that you represent ***.  Yes, you better get another job.  We have words in the South they don't have in other parts of the country.  I mean, you come to the South, we have words like, yonk to.  We go in the mall, yonk to. 
[03:59:30]  What letter does that start with?  Does anybody know?  I like this word a lot.  All right.  That's a word in Texas.  All right.
