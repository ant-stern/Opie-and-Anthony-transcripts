<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with the hosts discussing their rising fame thanks to their television show, immediately transitioning into promoting their upcoming Roxy performance featuring the bands Handsome, Another Society, and Corrosion of Conformity.  Opie then shared an anecdote about discovering a neighbor's trash bag on his new car, tracking down the culprit online, and confronting her, adding a comedic threat to return the garbage after the broadcast.

The conversation turned to the previous night's party, where their boss liberally used his credit card for drinks. This segued into a discussion about an adult baby products catalog they'd ordered, detailing its contents with graphic descriptions of items like "vagina panties," pacifiers, and baby maid outfits.  This led to a crude and sexually suggestive role-play of a phone order from the catalog.

The show concluded with a discussion about the frenzy surrounding Tickle Me Elmo, focusing on Opie's viewing of chaotic footage showing shoppers fighting over the remaining dolls in a store. They commented on the high demand and the doll's Chinese manufacturing.  The broadcast ended with another plug for their Roxy show.
