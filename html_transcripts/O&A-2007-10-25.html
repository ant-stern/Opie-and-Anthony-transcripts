<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts establishing their "radio bad boys" persona, rejecting the notion of "nice" radio.  They recounted a humorous story about Danny's damaged car following a confrontation with a taxi driver, which segued into a discussion of their own aggressive driving experiences and verbal altercations with various drivers, using highly offensive language. The conversation then shifted to the California wildfires, with the hosts mocking Arnold Schwarzenegger and making racially insensitive remarks while comparing the situation to Hurricane Katrina. They speculated on arson and terrorism as potential causes, referencing an FBI memo.  A caller compared commuting to a video game. The show interspersed these topics with discussions of a Red Sox win, a $1000 giveaway contest, listener calls, and their reaction to disappointing Arbitron ratings showing Howard Stern's significantly higher listenership.

The next segment focused heavily on their disputed Arbitron ratings. Opie and Anthony challenged the survey's methodology, citing their vacation, their XM suspension following an incident involving a homeless man's comments about Condoleezza Rice (with audio clips of the protest and police response included), and the exclusion of XM subscribers.  They countered the negative ratings with positive financial reports from their network.  A caller, Mary, a self-proclaimed huge fan who'd only listened for two weeks, was relentlessly teased.  The show also included a call-in contest, a discussion of Anthony's firearm collection and home security (including an on-air gun rack advertisement), and humorous anecdotes about his gun placement and a past incident in Buffalo.  A caller, Steve from Philly, expressed anger over their show's removal from Philadelphia airwaves, leading to a heated exchange between Opie, Anthony, and their agent, Bob, regarding Bob's handling of the situation and negotiations for a replacement show. Opie declared heâ€™d work for free in Philadelphia to spite Bob.  The segment ended with announcements of upcoming events, including E-Rock's appearance on a TV show, and a humorous reading of a Halloween safety tip news report.

The following segment opened with a chaotic scene featuring E-Rock's repeated absences from the studio for trivial reasons.  The hosts speculated, using crude language, about his possible addictions. The conversation transitioned to the Halloween candy poisoning myth, debunked using Snopes.com, and including a discussion of the 1974 Timothy Mark O'Brien murder case. E-Rock's continued distractions, including being caught looking at pornography on PalTalk, were a recurring theme.  The segment then featured a musical guest, "Papa Rock," a homeless man whose guitar performance was punctuated by extensive amplifier and tuning adjustments, leading to comedic exchanges with the hosts.  The segment concluded with Papa Rock's performance and further banter about his playing, the Halloween candy discussion, and the questionable Arbitron ratings.

The final segment included a discussion with Maury Povich, focusing on clips from his "phobia" show.  The hosts repeatedly substituted the phobias (balloons, bubble gum, chickens) with offensive words, leading to numerous bleeps.  "Stalker Patty," a previous caller, was briefly mentioned.  The hosts engaged in sexually explicit and offensive conversations, including jokes about a primordial dwarf and using derogatory language. The segment ended with further discussion of Maury Povich's show and more offensive humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screwed!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What?  Hold on.  Whose fault was that delay?  No.  No, is it?  Correct, open, humiliated.  What do you mean right in front of me?  When you just end like that, I had to type it up.  Dude, I looked at you and you went, boom, like, go.  That was sloppy.  If you had to say a celebrity that you most resembled, who would you say? 
[00:01:00]  Jodie Foster?  If she ate the real Jodie Foster.  Silence of the hams.  This is where entertainment is going.  I do not touch that.  The only things that may touch that is toilet paper and baby wipes.  I am right now.  Oh, my God.  They are sick.  How close did you get to having relations with a dog?  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds.  So we don't scratch more jokes.  It's time for people to understand these are words. 
[00:01:30]  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Stupid words.  Hi.  That's all they are in the end.  Just words.  Hello.  Hey, good morning.  It's the Opie and Anthony Shoe. 
[00:02:00]  Would a little Danny have an altercation for the taxi cab?  Yeah, I don't know if people understand, but maybe the people listening understand because  they're with us, but when you work this early in the morning, it's an obstacle course out 
[00:02:30]  there trying to get to work.  You got the drunk drivers coming home from the clubs.  Yep.  You got the cabbies that are like, ah, don't have to follow the rules.  No one's on the road besides the drunk drivers.  Wednesday is a treat, usually, because it's garbage truck day, which is really fun.  They just stop wherever the hell they want.  Oh, yeah.  In the middle of a five-lane road, they will just stop and start picking up garbage.  Who's bad, too, is the guys that deliver the morning papers. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  You know, you ever wonder, you know, you get to work and there's the morning paper?  Mm-hmm.  The reason it's always there, guaranteed, is because these guys are insane.  Yeah, drive like maniacs.  While we're sleeping, although we get to see their last few stops as we come in to work  every day, these guys drive down roadways backwards, the wrong way, sideways.  Yeah.  They'll pull up onto sidewalks in front of you.  They don't care.  They got to deliver the newspaper.  Sounding like me.  Right.  Well, and the local news here did a whole story on it where they caught these guys. 
[00:03:30]  And it was pretty impressive, some of the moves these guys have to make sure they get  all their deliveries in before we wake up with the morning paper.  So, you know, I've been in an accident with Club Soda Kenny, and we've had a lot of near  misses, and now our own Danny was in a little altercation this morning.  It's crazy out there every morning.  And I only live like 17, 20 blocks away, and it's an adventure every day.  Every day.  Usually it's not bad, though. 
[00:04:00]  I mean, I've, you know, I've been taking the same ride every day for, you know, I guess  almost, you know, over three years now.  Yeah.  You know, I never really came close to an accident except today.  And the best part was when the cabbie got out of his car after I finished screaming at  him, I'm like, I'm like, where are you going anyway?  And he's telling me that he was on his way to the tomato store.  So I'm glad that he ran his red light so that he can get to the tomato store.  Oh, the tomato store.  That much faster.  Good for him.  You messed up his cab?  No, not really.  I mean, he's driving a, you know, a steel, you know, almost 4,000 pound Crown Victoria. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  I'm driving a 89 Toyota Corolla.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Two damage.  Two damage.  I think he beat you.  Oh, yeah.  Cab wins every time in that one.  Oh, yeah.  In that matchup.  Although I did deliver the perfect pit maneuver.  Did you?  I spun him around and everything.  Oh, nice.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  It was pretty sweet.  But he was on the way to the tomato store.  All right.  Well, great.  I mean, at least he got to drive his car home.  Mine's in some animals impound yard somewhere. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  If you're locally, the UPS building in Queens.  So that's just super convenient to get to.  Yeah.  Especially during the week.  Oh, man.  It's just a nightmare.  Oh, it's absolutely.  That sucks.  It's so out of the way.  It sucks.  And now I'm probably, I mean, I'm not going to fix my car.  That's such a crap car.  Why would I even bother fixing this?  So now I got to, you know, try to find a car by, like, the weekend.  Oh, man.  Major world.  Major world.  Major world.  You know, if you weren't such a raging alcoholic, I would give you my car for a while. 
[00:05:30]  But that's a rough one, man.  You'd find it would have, like, blood in the fender and, like, a little ribbon.  A ribbon.  A little patent leather buckle shoe.  One puppy paw.  Yeah, that would be a rough one.  So, good luck to you on that.  I had a fun little episode driving yesterday myself.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Kind of around where I live.  You know, when you go underneath, like, the parkway or the expressway, there's a left turn lane there to get back on the service road. 
[00:06:00]  Let's say you want to make a U-turn under the expressway to get from one direction of the service road to the other direction.  Well, near where I live, I had to do that.  So, I'm in the left lane now, waiting for the light to change so I can continue, make another left, and be going the other direction on the service road.  So, they repainted some lines and stuff on the street and put a crosswalk in. 
[00:06:30]  The crosswalk was never there, but it's brand new.  It's in there.  Okay.  So, I go to make my left turn when the light turns green for me, and I'm just concentrating on oncoming traffic to make my left.  So, when the light's green, I see no oncoming traffic, I begin to make my turn.  Then, I see there's a guy in the crosswalk.  Now, I can't sit there and wait in oncoming traffic.  So, I looked, realized I had enough time to get in front of him. 
[00:07:00]  It's a move that's done all the time in the city here.  You just, if someone's in the crosswalk out on Long Island, you're supposed to just stop and let them continue.  Pretty much any city in America at this point.  In New York City, though, it's pretty much just weave in and out of pedestrians.  So, the guy had plenty of room.  He had just stepped off the curb, and I realized I'm sitting in the middle of traffic, so let me just goose it, get past the crosswalk, and continue on my way.  So, I did that.  I look in the rearview mirror, and the guy took his bag of groceries and wailed it at my car. 
[00:07:30]  Dude, he flung his, he was so angry with me that he threw his groceries at my car.  He had just gone to, like, the grocery store that was on the corner, I guess.  Yeah.  He had, like, four plastic bags, two in each hand.  You gotta respect that.  I gotta be honest, man.  He took one, he gave it the old David versus Goliath spin, and then wailed it, but I was already way too far. 
[00:08:00]  I so wanted to, like, my mind was wrapping around it still when I'm looking in the rearview mirror and just laughing my ass off.  Oh, you were laughing.  All right, good.  I was hysterical laughing.  The guy's face was mad.  His groceries now strewn in the street.  So, I wanted to hook the U-turn back around again and go, did that make you happy?  Did that, what did that do for you?  What did he have in the thing?  Was it, like, a bunch of canned stuff, or was it just, like, little marshmallow bags?  I was hoping, for his sake, it was canned goods so he could salvage them and not, you know, a coffee cake, something you're delicious that is now just squished in the road. 
[00:08:30]  That's how mad he got him, because I'm sure the stuff he had in his bag was stuff he really wanted.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, he just got it.  It wasn't necessities.  He actually walked to the store.  He was like, oh, I want some crumb cake.  He wanted it.  Maybe some Haagen-Dazs.  Some little, a pint of Haagen-Dazs and crumb cake.  Oh, I'm going to, yo!  And he had to throw it at your car, and then he had to turn around and go get the same exact stuff. 
[00:09:00]  And that's what made me laugh, is the thought of him, like, yelling under his breath, picking up his groceries out of the street, and trying to dodge traffic as he does it.  That's really funny.  And I just go in my locomotive past him.  Choo-choo!  Yeah, well.  Ass.  And then Jimmy was saying, he had an incident.  What's going on with the show, with a little road rage?  Yeah, people are stupid.  Why don't you read the papers?  You can get shot for road rage these days.  I am very aware.  I was going down to the cellar last night, and I was running a few minutes late, so I'm behind a taxi cab. 
[00:09:30]  And whenever they have their light on, at the top, it means they're looking for affairs.  They're going slow.  And they're animals.  They beep at you for anything.  If the light goes plink, and you don't move, they're like, blah, blah.  Yep.  So I'm beeping at this guy, because legitimately, he was going terribly slow.  So he's just going slower and slower.  And of course, I know he's doing it on purpose.  So we go a whole block, and he picks up.  This is like a one-lane side street.  And he picks up a fare, and then I beep because he's not moving. 
[00:10:00]  And then he just waits at the green light and lets it turn.  Ooh!  Oh, that is a bastard move.  It's amazing.  I've used it before.  How much did your body heat up, man?  I literally, I had to pray, because I wanted to take my car and attack his car with it.  I wanted to drive my car into his car and assault him with my car.  Dude, you know he was looking in his mirror going, you take that, my friend. 
[00:10:30]  I had to go to 7th Avenue, but he made it right on 9th.  I made it right on 9th.  I don't know if I've ever been so angry at a person.  I was kind of smiling at him.  If I had a gun, I would kill this guy.  Yeah, you would just kill him.  I wasn't even kidding.  I wasn't being ironic.  I would have shot him in the street.  I've said things, I've verbally assaulted cab drivers to the point where they were so angry  with me, like I could let out some vicious venom to cab drivers, and I do.  When they pull some shenanigans like that, I pull up right next to them, roll the window 
[00:11:00]  down, and I go, hey, hey, and it's nothing but, I swear to you, the worst venom that could  spew out of a human's mouth to another human being comes out of my mouth, and they leave  really feeling badly.  They try to blow it off, but I'm saying things that really hit deep, really deep.  You haven't lived until you've been in a cab and had a fight through the little window.  Oh, that's always fun, too, yeah.  Trading jabs through the little square window. 
[00:11:30]  What, are you backing them up?  What?  What, were you backing up your driver?  Things happen.  But you haven't lived until you have an actual fight through.  How big is the window that you had your money through?  I'll argue in a cab, yeah.  Not even argue, it got down to a frequent.  You got to stick your lips to the, hey, you son of a bitch.  No, not that.  They keep it open, so it's like a, I don't know, maybe, what, a foot by a foot?  Maybe.  Maybe, yeah.  Yeah, you haven't lived until you've traded jabs through that space. 
[00:12:00]  God, they're awful.  They are just this.  Jimmy brought up something, though.  There's some kind of entitlement going on with them that they don't quite understand.  Well, he said, he said to me, because I looked at him, and I was so, I didn't want, because  he had two old ladies in the car, so I don't want to start screaming curses.  That's the only reason I did.  Oh, I don't care.  Children in the car, puppies, I will scream.  I was going, you drive slow.  You drive too slow.  I was smiling.  I was beyond, I was so angry.  It was almost like I was in a dream.  And he wasn't cursing.  He was just going, up yours, up yours. 
[00:12:30]  He was like an older guy.  What, what, what, was he?  No, he was a white guy.  An old American guy?  He was an American guy.  He was either a white guy or a light-skinned black guy.  I couldn't even tell.  White cab drivers are insane, first of all.  They're all just crazy people.  I couldn't tell.  He was American, though.  Yeah.  But I couldn't tell.  He was like two lanes over.  And, you know, I was, I can't never own a gun.  I don't know how you own guns.  I couldn't do it.  Oh, it's wonderful.  I could not do it.  You do bring up a good point about using your car.  I've come very, very close to using my car to kind of just play a little NASCAR, trade 
[00:13:00]  a little paint.  Trade a little paint.  And I was thinking about this the other day, that my car's getting a little too old,  and I got to get a brand new car.  Not because I want a brand new car, but I know if I have a brand new car, then these thoughts  of actually hitting another vehicle on the road will go away.  I'm not going to do that with a brand new car.  Yeah.  But when you start looking at your car, and mine's about six years old now, and there's  a lot of dings, and where work trucks have just dropped hammers on the hood and stuff,  I really don't have anything to lose at this point. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  And I was thinking of that the other day.  So it's funny Jimmy brought that up, because I have these thoughts, and I'm like, what do  I have to lose?  I got an older car, and I'll just trade a little paint with this guy.  Or actually, it's never a guy.  Let's be honest, it's a soccer mom from freaking Dix Hills or something.  Or somebody that just maybe came from some other land that has no concept of the rules.  You're not trading paint with a gang member or a wise guy.  You always size them up.  And I have no problem admitting this, and I think we all think this way, but if you say 
[00:14:00]  it on the radio, they'll call up, oh, you're a pussy.  No, but we're all human beings.  Because when someone cuts you off or does something on the road, you size them up, and  you're like, all right, I can take them, so now I'm going to make their life a living  hell.  Yeah.  But if it's someone that looks like they're in the rap community or a gang member or a  wise guy or just a guy that looks like he works out at the gym eight days a week.  Yes, I said eight days a week. 
[00:14:30]  He figures out an extra day a week.  Yes, that's the joke.  Then you're leaving them alone.  But if it's a soccer mom getting a bit ballsy on the road, what are you doing?  An older person, what are you doing?  You're making their life a living hell.  That's just how it works.  I leave the old people drivers alone.  I never yell at them, but I will pull moves to get away from them.  The most people I yell at on any given day are cab drivers, and those goddamn black car  livery drivers, they are so goddamn bad. 
[00:15:00]  But there's a difference between the two.  I learned this a while ago.  For some reason, if you get aggressive with a cab, they'll back way off because there's  something going on that they rent their cars and they have to bring them back to the garage  in perfect condition.  Yeah, that's where you get your ads.  Any ads or something, there's something that goes on.  They get in a lot of trouble because they back right off if you're aggressive with them.  But the black cars, that's a whole other story.  I don't know what's going on with those guys.  I think they own their own cars because they are the most aggressive cars on the road here 
[00:15:30]  in New York City.  And they're licensed.  You can always tell who they are because it's a taxi commission.  It's the first letter of the license is T, the last letter is C.  So when I see that, I automatically hate the person behind the wheel.  Exactly.  Automatically hate them.  No worse.  The cabs, though, I usually wind up saying things about family members that are probably  in a faraway country and how I hope one of our huge American bombs land on their houses.  Dude, I swear to you, it is some of the worst stuff I've ever yelled out a window have been 
[00:16:00]  at cab drivers.  There's also another thing going on.  And this is pretty relatively new.  So most cars these days, trucks anyway, have fold-away mirrors.  I don't consider tapping mirrors to be any kind of accident or altercation.  I really don't.  A lot of people have no clue what the parameters of their vehicles are.  I will sit there as a Honda Civic or something is in front of me being unsure if they could 
[00:16:30]  fit through a spot where two trucks are.  And meanwhile, I could just wail through in an SUV.  Yeah.  And it annoys the crap out of me that people don't know what the parameters of their vehicle  are.  Now, also, I'll make moves in between trucks that might be a little tight.  And sometimes you hear, you know, you'll hit mirrors.  And then I get, hey, hey. 
[00:17:00]  The window goes down.  It's like, dude, your mirror folds back now.  It's not like the old days where it snaps off.  Oh, so when you bump it, it's just folding it back.  It's a little mirror tap.  Mirror tap is fine by me.  I'll never do it to a new vehicle like that, whether it's mine or someone else's.  But if it's just a couple of trucks on the road, a couple of SUVs or a big box truck, tap  and mirrors is something you just do these days.  That's it. 
[00:17:30]  Or else you're going to be sitting there in traffic.  I'm really good going on those side roads.  I have the peripheral figured out.  I could go like 40, 50 miles an hour and have literally inches on each side.  Oh, dude.  One time I was doing, I had to be doing about 50 down a side street where these trucks were  double parked.  So you have no room.  As I'm flying through, I'm hitting the button to suck my mirrors in and just make it through.  And then the mirrors come back out.  When people are driving with me, they get really scared.  I'm like, trust me, I've been doing this for a long time. 
[00:18:00]  No worries.  I got it all figured out.  I got my peripheral.  I know exactly how much room I got on both sides.  I size it up for a second and then I'm gone.  Yeah.  And then you get behind someone that you'll see them in another situation where they got  at least two feet on each side.  You're like, why are you going a mile an hour?  This is easy.  Bill, stop.  This is easy.  And then when a truck, this happens a lot when I drive home, trucks back into these loading  docks and it takes forever.  But the second a space opens up in front of the truck, I'm gone. 
[00:18:30]  I'm gone right past them.  But you'll get people in front of you that wait for the truck to get completely into  the loading dock before they move.  Yeah.  Let's go to the phones here.  It's Fontaine.  Fontaine, what's up?  Good morning.  Hey, how are you, buddy?  I was expecting a woman.  Stupid me.  But what's up?  Dude, this is the best video game ever.  I mean, dodging garbage trucks, cab drivers, fat boys, eating mayonnaise sandwiches, walking 
[00:19:00]  down the street.  Well, it is like a video game.  And if you turn down the right alley, you might even see somebody throw a bloody gee in the  dumpster.  Ling-a-long-a.  The bloody gee.  Wow.  That is ling-a-long-a-ring.  Ling-a-long-a-ring.  That's very good.  Yeah, it is like a, I strap in every morning now, man.  Oh, yeah.  Kenny picks me up and I strap in.  I'm like, what are we going to see today?  You got to strap in. 
[00:19:30]  I got to start taking notes because I haven't even thought about this until, you know, we  started the show talking about our commute in.  But you see interesting things every single day.  Oh, here's another little treat for my commute anyway.  The Midtown Tunnel, at this hour of the morning when I come in, they close down one lane for  cleaning.  Right.  A huge machine goes in.  It looks like something out of a sci-fi movie with brushes and water nozzles and actually  scrubs down the tiles in these tunnels. 
[00:20:00]  For what reason?  For what?  I've seen that.  I'm like, why?  And now that's what they do.  They used to, if you remember going through like the Midtown Tunnel and stuff years ago,  it was always just caked with exhaust and brake pad asbestos and stuff.  So now they kind of scrub it off, whatever.  But it's one lane is close.  So it's just one lane through the tunnel.  As I'm coming up to the toll plaza, I'll eyeball everything.  If I see a box truck or one of those goddamn buses that haul Asian people around for some 
[00:20:30]  reason, they're white.  They got double doors in the back.  It looks like a little mini bus.  Those things are hell to be behind in a one lane tunnel.  So I'll size up everyone and blast the gas and just fly to the toll plaza, making sure  I get in front of anything that's going to interrupt my drive through the tunnel.  And a lot of times I will be yelled at by the cops at the toll plaza because I go through. 
[00:21:00]  I don't stop.  The gate goes up, just misses the windshield of my car, like I'm zooming through.  But if you get behind one of those things, you'll be screaming.  They do 10 miles an hour and they're constantly on the brakes.  So when they step on the brake, every time I see the brake light go on, beep, I beep the horn.  Beep.  Beep.  And then it gets to the point where they understand when they put their foot on the brake, that's  when I'm beeping.  You got to knock it into their heads.  You got to wake them up a little bit, morons. 
[00:21:30]  All right.  We're just getting started here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to give away another $1,000 today between 7 and 7.30.  I forgot what the sound was.  Oh, I remember what it was.  This is what you're listening for starting at 7 o'clock, sometime between 7 and 7.30.  You got to listen for this particular sound that we will play right now.  But don't call now. 
[00:22:00]  Don't call now.  When you hear this between 7 and 7.30.  I bring nothing to the table.  There's your sound of the day for the $1,000.  Okay, we'll continue.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Is the feedback going crazy?  A lot of people from Boston checking in.  Big win for the Red Sox last night.  13-1.  Yeah, it was close.  Beckett is unstoppable.  Red Sox will win the World Series. 
[00:22:30]  Beckett gets to pitch possibly three times.  They're not beating Beckett.  That's what it comes down to.  That's a tough one.  We say that year after year after year, good pitching wins World Series in the end.  Wins the World Series in the end.  That's why the Yankees got to keep doing things they were doing.  Getting guys like Kevin Brown and Randy Johnson.  Spend the big bucks on men in their 40s with back problems.  That's the way you win.  Yeah, the Yankee organization just doesn't understand that.  They spend all their money on A-Rod and Dirk Jeter and the rest. 
[00:23:00]  And then they go, ah, we got some leftover money to get pitchers way past their prime.  Pitching wins the World Series every time out.  Like Clemens.  Like Clemens, yeah.  Pulling a hammy, what, after 10 pitches or whatever it was?  They just don't know how to scout and build a stable of pitchers.  Beckett was ridiculous last night.  13-1 was the final score, right?  Nine strikeouts, I think. 
[00:23:30]  What was his stats?  Nine strikeouts and seven innings.  Go Sox, go.  And that's when I go to the instant feedback.  Opie, how about them Red Sox?  Looks like the sports curves might be hibernating or something.  I wrote them off the minute you said Go Sox, but I guess I was wrong.  Go Sox.  What, it's one game in?  Well, people have beaten me up on the instant feedback because the Red Sox won.  I really, truly want the Red Sox to win the World Series.  Yeah.  You do.  I absolutely do.  Seen a lot of B-hats out there. 
[00:24:00]  A lot of bandwagon jumpers.  The only team I would want to see win the World Series besides the Sox would be the Mets.  That wasn't in the cards this year, obviously.  What's your third choice?  Not the Yankees.  No.  I didn't think it was, but do you have a third choice?  I kind of like the Phillies.  You know, I liked them this year.  Yeah.  You sure did.  You liked them right into golf.  Yeah.  Well, the Rockies just looked awful last night. 
[00:24:30]  And then they're saying, I pointed this out a while ago, and I've been on this thing for  a while.  The wildfires now.  Oh, yeah.  They're thinking to arson and terrorism.  You got Arnie trying to calm everybody down there in California.  They're starting to get the fires under control.  They got a long ways to go, but...  Yeah.  The winds were dying down.  They're getting more help in.  And, well, Arnold is there, so everything's fine. 
[00:25:00]  Well, that was the key, waiting for the winds to die down.  Oh, I thought you meant Arnold being there.  Oh, no.  He's just a figurehead.  If you took somebody from, like, 1985, 89, 87, somewhere around there, and then just shipped  them into the future, they'd watch all this and go, like, wait a minute.  Why is Arnold Schwarzenegger talking about the fires and using some of his stupid movie  lines?  He's actually using his movie lines during some of these press conferences. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  He's like, you know, you have to be there for the people to, you know, pump them up.  No.  He said pump them up.  No.  To pump them up.  Yes.  Are you kidding?  Well, we got some...  Mr. Schwarzenegger told CNN, you've got to be with the people.  It's the most important thing.  You've got to go out there and you've got to visit all of the fire sites.  You've got to shake hands with the firefighters.  You've got to encourage them.  Shake hands with the firefighters.  They got hoses in their hands. 
[00:26:00]  Leave them alone.  Shake their hands after it's all out.  You've got to pump them up.  There you go.  You've got to tell them they're the greatest in the world.  Yeah.  Pump them up.  The water crews that are dropping aerial water.  So you've got to tell them, get to the chopper.  Just a moaning, groaning idiot is in charge.  I've been in this situation before in Predator. 
[00:26:30]  When they blew up the atomic nuclear device, everything was burning.  But I came out okay.  I suggest to the people of California, cover yourselves in mud.  Cover yourselves completely in mud.  So keep away the Predator and protect you from the fire.  He went on to say, being out there with the people is the key thing.  Don't hide in your capital because there's no action there at all.  Action.  I need action.  I'm the governor, you idiot. 
[00:27:00]  Come on.  Well, ABC.  Come on.  Do it.  Do it.  Come on.  Put the fire out.  Do it now.  ABC tried to get Arnold to compare the fires to Katrina.  Yeah.  One is fire.  One is water.  Okay.  Next question.  You can't compare the two because one got help and the other one didn't.  The other one didn't.  I hear that Qualcomm Stadium, by the way, is like a luxury resort. 
[00:27:30]  People are coming in there and being treated like kings and queens.  At this point, I think they're passing out caviar to everybody.  Yeah.  A little caviar is being passed out.  Actually, I heard on the news this morning.  No crap.  They were saying that besides the festive atmosphere in there, people are still worried that they  have a house to go home to.  So I'm like, wow, there's a festive atmosphere going on in a stadium full of people that have  been in there for days. 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  Thousands of people.  But they're getting everything they need.  They're getting food and water and massages to relieve their stress is what I'm hearing.  And they're not just finding a place to take a dump.  No.  And of all the shots I've seen, I have not seen one of a dead body in a wheelchair next  to the front door.  Oh, remember that?  We didn't see that.  It's a different situation also because, I mean, you can get in and out of certain areas.  It's not like it's water all around you and you can't leave. 
[00:28:30]  The fires are kind of surrounding certain areas.  It's an interesting observation, though.  I mean, when your multi-million dollar home is being burned down, they look at it differently  than poor people being pointed out.  Than an old tin shack with eight people on the roof waving for a helicopter.  We really do suck in this country.  There could be a bit of a double standard.  Just a bit.  This is ABC talking to Arnold, comparing this to Katrina.  So you think the comparison to Katrina that everybody's making in the back of their minds 
[00:29:00]  these days is a good one, in terms of state and federal?  All you have to do is just look around here and see how happy people are.  No one is screaming.  No one is complaining about anything.  Say.  No one's complaining about anything.  It's great.  It's great.  Look, I got this under control, unlike that mayor down there in New Orleans.  It's great.  Look at all the white faces.  It's wonderful.  Fantastic white faces.  Don't be confused.  That's a white face, too.  They just have mud on their face. 
[00:29:30]  Very peaceful.  They still haven't showered.  Those are white people, too.  Not like, well, you know.  And don't let me bring up the Jews, too.  My father, let him bring up the Jews.  Unbelievable.  And he continues.  Well, you're saying everybody's working together,  but you have heard there have been some complaints from officials,  for example, in Orange County.  No.  If we'd only had more resources earlier, more planes, more firefighting resources, 
[00:30:00]  we might have been able to head off those fires that are ravaging Orange County right now.  Anyone that is complaining about the planes just wants to complain.  Because it's a bunch of nonsense.  Shut up!  We have all the planes in the world here.  We have 90 aircrafts here, and they can't fly because of the wind situation.  Trust me.  I'm going to tell you.  You're looking for a mistake, and you won't find it because it's all good news.  As much as you maybe hate it, but it's good news.  Trust me, okay?  I don't hate it.  I'm just listening to Orange County.  Stop it.  Stop it.  God bless Arnold Schwarzenegger giving her a little crap because she's trying to make something 
[00:30:30]  out of something that's not there.  You don't need to make more out of this story.  It's pretty intense.  It's very interesting to watch the coverage of these fires out there.  And the reporter, of course, well, trying to compare it to Katrina.  Good for Arnold Schwarzenegger getting in her face a little bit.  Everything's good.  Fine.  Oh, I don't know if I agree with him that it was a party atmosphere.  Yeah, yeah.  Your houses are burning.  They're not there.  It's not a big Halloween bash.  There are a couple of people that might be a little upset.  Their lives are on fire. 
[00:31:00]  I see.  Everybody feeling hot, hot, hot.  This is wonderful.  Look, we're here at Qualcomm Stadium.  It's great.  There's a conga line going to pick up the caviar.  This is wonderful.  People like this.  There you go.  Hey, everybody on the fire truck.  Come on.  Take laps around Qualcomm.  This is great.  Yes, the fire's here, but we're feeling hot, hot, hot. 
[00:31:30]  Come on.  Dance, you idiot.  I want to ask you again.  Come here, reporter.  Let me grope you.  Look, I'm groping women reporters.  I'm groping them as we do a conga line.  Hot, hot, hot.  Boom, boom, boom, boom.  Yeah, party.  It's a party atmosphere.  I'll see you at the wildfire party, Richter. 
[00:32:00]  Get your ass to California.  Hey, we got Wolf Blitzer on the line.  I don't mean to interrupt you, Arnold, but...  We got Wolf Blitzer stepping aside from the Situation Room to call the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yes, Wolf?  Good morning.  I can explain the conditions in Qualcomm Stadium.  They are so rich, and they're so white.  Wow, Wolf with another faux pas. 
[00:32:30]  Oops, oops.  They're so rich and so white.  Come on, everybody, do the electric slide.  Right.  Celine Dion.  Oh, is she?  Is she yapped up?  Let these people...  Let the millionaires touch their mansions.  The fires.  There are fires that are ruining mansions.  People have paid millions for these, and now there's nothing left except their insurance policies, 
[00:33:00]  which will probably pay double the price of the house.  Let them collect their money.  Let them collect their millions of dollars in insurance.  Let's get some escalades.  Yes.  Get some escalades and break through the fire.  All that's left are their built-in pools filled with water.  Other houses are being burnt.  These poor people have never seen millions and billions of dollars. 
[00:33:30]  Let them touch it.  Let them build their new mansions.  Put out the fires so they can start rebuilding their mansions.  They would somehow be survivors.  That's what's interesting about this whole thing.  It sucks to lose your house, obviously.  Yeah.  But the people that own those houses could build another one, the exact same one, the exact same  lot.  And they will, right? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  And they will do it quickly, too.  You watch.  It's just all your personal stuff for these people.  It's not even the house.  It's all, like, your memories and stuff.  Hopefully, you get that crap out.  You should be smart and have something in your basement, like a big fireproof safe.  Just throw all your valuables in there and expect the fire or the flood.  Let them touch it.  That's a black person because they've never seen one in the neighborhood before.  Let's go to Isaac from Montreal.  Montreal.  I was just going to suggest that maybe you play Burning Down the House as a tribute to 
[00:34:30]  those in California.  Oh, wow.  That is not funny.  Hot, hot, hot.  Everything's fine.  Wonderful.  Terrific.  No fires here.  Look away.  This radio thing is challenging.  Hot, hot, hot.  Funny.  Burning Down the House.  Still funny.  Still funny.  But just pissing off people.  All right.  Thank you, Isaac.  What are you doing with all your wedding photos and stuff? 
[00:35:00]  Do you think people here are kind of ready?  Like, do you think most of them have a contingency plan to get, like, the irreplaceable crap out  of the house?  Like, I mean, maybe I'm just being a naive idiot, but do you have your second home burned  down?  You know what?  I can speak for a lot of married people out there.  I'm not married, but wedding photos just are worthless.  They grab the album.  They're worthless.  After you get the wedding photos done, what do you do with them?  You throw them in a book, and then you don't see it for the rest of your life.  Ends up, the first couple of years of marriage, I think it ends up on an end table or the coffee 
[00:35:30]  table in your living room for people that want to come over and look.  And then it just goes in a closet, or then it might end up in a box in the attic.  They're completely worthless.  I disagree.  I like, somebody shows me a wedding album.  Much like the wife herself.  I like a good wedding album, because the people are like, well, this is, like, when they hold,  like, oh, she's holding the flowers, and these are the bridesmaids.  Exactly.  Exactly, man.  Wedding photo albums, worthless. 
[00:36:00]  That's what you learned today from this radio show.  I've pretty much scanned in even old pictures and videos.  Everything is now on my computer.  I have them in multiple locations on various hard drives.  So what I really have to do is just kind of make sure I grab a hard drive, I guess.  This is crazy, but I have so many photos.  For me, it's the photos that are irreplaceable.  A few things I have, but most of my pictures.  And I've scanned a lot of the family stuff.  And it's funny, I saw my Aunt Donna, and she had pictures of my father and my Uncle Joe 
[00:36:30]  and stuff, and she was like, look at these.  And I'm like, why don't you scan those?  And she's like, can you do that and put them on a computer?  I'm like, yes.  You know what?  Paper pictures.  You know what's making photos more valuable to you personally these days?  It's like what I did and what Jimmy did.  You know, usually you got all your pictures in a drawer or whatever, and you never really,  like, spend the time looking through it and stuff.  But now that's my screensaver.  So I got a computer that is just flashing pictures from the last three or four years.  Make sure you know what album they're taking it from.  You end up like that guy. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, right?  But Filipino boy and then a horse.  This one from, oh, I love Tub Girl.  But now it's kind of cool.  When I go into a house and I see, like, one picture and a picture frame, to me, that's  really weird.  Because, you know, with the technology today, you could have, like, a picture frame that  is rotating pictures or a computer screen rotating pictures.  And now it's like, now these pictures are kind of valuable.  And you do something with them.  Yeah, they're not just sitting in an album never to be seen.  That's a good idea, actually, man.  You have to have a rotating picture frame. 
[00:37:30]  That's a good idea.  I bought one, you know, for someone in the Philly crew last, wow, I guess it's a year,  almost two years ago.  And it's so dated now.  What?  And it cost me a bloody fortune.  Oh, the picture frame thing?  From B&H.  Well, also people can...  But now that technology, you can throw it on any computer.  But I had to buy the actual picture frame.  And it had a certain thing.  You put the card in and then it rotated your pictures.  People do that with their HDTVs.  If you have it in your living room up on the wall. 
[00:38:00]  Exactly.  When the TV's not...  When you're not watching TV, it's just scrolling pictures.  So you're burning or no, you're not burning?  Okay.  No, it's changing the whole time.  So...  Panasonic, one of the sponsors of our show, we ended up getting TVs from those guys.  And in the front of the TV, you put your little card in.  And then, yeah, it rotates on the TV.  Yeah, through all that.  So it kind of ends up being like a display of pictures up on your wall.  And then when you want to watch TV, you watch TV.  Yeah, that's pretty cool, right?  Absolutely.  It's the future.  Let's say hi to George in Long Island. 
[00:38:30]  George.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Good evening.  My car is a mess because of you guys.  This is the second time this week I shot coffee at him.  I know I was laughing so hard on you guys.  An unbelievable bit.  What got you?  The hot, hot, hot?  Or the Celine Dion?  Actually, the hot, hot, hot was it.  And, oh, Andy was talking about Dr. Quinn Madison woman a couple days ago.  Oh, yes.  Why are you talking about Jane Seymour?  I told you.  F her. 
[00:39:00]  I forgot.  F her.  F Jane Seymour.  She's a wonderful woman.  All right, boys.  Just wanted to call her.  An entertainer.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Hey, I kind of want to pound myself.  On the back, I've been telling you that this wildfire thing, this is the next stage of  terrorism.  I've been saying this for well over a year.  Well, they are saying that it's arson.  And again, I think it was Jimmy that brought it up.  Did you bring up, like, how the hell do they find out it's arson when you have a...  They have figured out that the fire was set in two different areas, and they got that 
[00:39:30]  area like quarantine or whatever, because they don't want to...  What was the quote?  They don't want to...  Get burned-ed.  Get burned.  They don't want to get burned-ed.  They don't want to compromise the area, whatever.  So they already figured out where the fires have started.  That is insane.  And Jimmy did bring that up the other day.  How did they say that?  Are you sure I did?  I don't know if I did, actually.  I don't know.  I knew it was some idiot.  Oh, wait.  It was me.  I don't think I did.  Yeah, I'll take credit for that, too.  Oh, you know what it is? 
[00:40:00]  They actually found a match in the middle of the forest fire.  Yeah, a match.  Or something.  Like, how the hell do you find that?  I don't know.  Where some bear in a fire hat walked out, said he was smoky.  Turns out he was just a homosexual from Oakland.  We got the best California wildfire coverage on the radio, so let's continue.  Yes, this is from Fox News.  The wildfires continue.  And we were talking earlier in today's telecast with Adam Housley,  and apparently police officers in a hovering helicopter saw a guy starting one of these fires. 
[00:40:30]  And Allison Camerana, an FBI memo from late in June of this year is popping up this morning, and it's ominous.  This actually has happened for many years in the past as well.  An FBI memo sent out to local law enforcement that said that an al-Qaeda detainee had given them some information that the next wave of terrorism could be in the form of setting wildfires.  Can you get what was just on shot 11? 
[00:41:00]  I'm sure.  I'm sure it's ill.  Yeah, but you know what?  If they're going to report on it all day, we've got to talk about it.  Yeah.  Anyway, can you get that then?  And then finally, it continues with this.  Brian, the plot, they say, according to this detainee, and they don't know if the detainee is telling the truth or if he's just lying.  The plot was to set three or four wildfires, but they don't mention California.  They mention Colorado, Montana, Utah, and Wyoming. 
[00:41:30]  And yet we do know for a fact...  Wow, way to pick a populated state.  I know.  That's pretty dumb if you're a terrorist.  I know.  They're going to bomb.  The al-Qaeda is focusing now on Lancaster, PA.  They're going to attack a molasses factory and blow up that service road that the buggies all use to bring their churned butter to the general store.  Idiocy.  And when they're done with that, they're going to bomb Death Valley. 
[00:42:00]  Death Valley's next.  Yeah, because no one wants to be that hot, I guess.  Utah and Wyoming.  And yet we do know for a fact that a number of the fires out in Southern California are of a suspicious nature, and they are investigating arson.  Hmm.  There you go.  Suspicious nature.  Kind of obvious, though, man.  I mean, how do you defend against that?  And now that that is kind of out there, now we have to kind of figure out, wow, how do we defend against that? 
[00:42:30]  But I'll say it's a bad move for terrorism.  It's an inconvenience, and it sucks for a lot of wealthy people.  But you're not hurting the infrastructure of the country.  You're douching some nice people, I'm sure.  But you're not.  It's like 9-11 really was effective and awful.  But you're not doing anything.  I think it's more long-term.  You're tying up resources.  You are burning a lot of people's houses.  And you're burning through a lot of cash.  I mean, this is well into the billions at this point, right? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, the president declared a state of emergency, so that federal money is now flowing in.  Georgia's really dry right now.  Really dry.  Yeah.  You know, why?  You want to throw a match out the window, Georgia's the place to do it.  Wow.  Of course don't.  I mean, if you're a terrorist.  By the way, if you're driving...  I don't think I have to make suggestions to terrorists.  If you're driving your car and you throw a match out the window and it doesn't, like, immediately go out.  Imagine if you threw a lit match out a window while doing 50 and it somehow managed to land without being extinguished. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, I don't know how that happens sometimes.  A match.  If I sneeze, the match goes out.  If you're doing 50, your match is doomed.  You got to take a cigarette and some kindling.  Kindling wood.  You need kindling wood.  Do we have toothpicks to keep our eyes open?  Because Mike, he's going to explain how they test trees for arson.  Mike.  Mike.  Let's go, guys.  Mike.  Go ahead.  Actually, what they do is they take, like, the direction of the wind and they find the actual place where they think the fire actually started. 
[00:44:00]  Well, Mike, do they actually do, like, weather tests on the weather that had been leading up to it?  Or is it basically just...  What's the exact process?  Quiet.  We got the mayor of New Orleans on the line.  Is he still the mayor?  Who knows?  Mayor Ray Nagin, known for saying some pretty controversial stuff. 
[00:44:30]  Is he still the mayor?  I think so, yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Mayor Ray Nagin.  What's up, Mayor?  Gentlemen.  Yeah.  I just wanted to let you know that San Diego will be a white chocolate city once more.  They cannot keep us out.  It will not happen.  Once again.  Wow, that's controversial, sir.  Once again, a very controversial remark from Mayor Ray Nagin.  Yeah, the wildfire is just like Hurricane Katrina.  Just like it. 
[00:45:00]  It's white vanilla, Ray.  See, that would be the kind of opposite of black chocolate.  White chocolate.  Dark chocolate.  Yeah.  White chocolate.  It's going to be a Zinfandel city.  Sorry, I just didn't say white vanilla.  All right.  Let's go to AJ in Connecticut.  AJ, what's up?  How you doing, guys?  Hey.  Hey.  You're absolutely right with the wedding album.  I just have to tell you that.  You know, I've married five years.  The wedding album was out with the video.  You know, after that, I have no idea where it is. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, you'd play the video for people that come over, and then after a while, it just  goes, eh, let's put this away.  No one wants to see your wedding video.  No one.  You know, I've had a lot of people married in my family, and they all got their wedding  videos.  Not at once did they sit me down and go, we're going to watch the wedding video.  They just know no one wants to see it.  They don't even want to see it.  The only time you watch a wedding video is when your husband has been shot in the beginning  of the movie, and no one knows he's dead until you're breathing cold air out.  When a wedding video helps you tie up a film, it's a good time for it. 
[00:46:00]  It's an awkward video.  Is this thing on?  Oh, I don't know what to say.  Just say something nice about the couple.  Well, congratulations.  Can you get me another white wine?  I'm in the middle of making my video.  Oh, I love it.  Yeah, you get some old bag, and she's got the microphone backwards.  Yeah.  No, turn it the other way, grandma.  Grandma.  My in-laws watch it probably every other day. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  I could see maybe a nice wedding photo that may be a display in your house, but after  that, who gives a crap?  No one wants to see it.  Yeah.  Exactly.  A fire coming around my house.  I'm grabbing my cigars and scotch and running out the door.  Yeah, see?  I think a lot of wedding albums burned in California.  And they could have saved those, but they're like, why?  Why bother?  All right.  Thank you, AJ.  Take it easy.  All right.  Fire sucks.  Let's take a break. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, fire does.  Wow.  I take risks like that on the radio.  I'll say anything crazy and edgy.  Got on the edge.  Yeah.  Fire sucks.  Fire sucks.  That was probably first said by like a caveman.  Yeah.  That got burnt when he touched it.  The first caveman that came home and just saw like a hollowed out husk where all his cave  drawings were.  Yeah.  There's no way to put them on disc.  Fire suck.  Uh, Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, hello.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Sean.  How are you, buddy? 
[00:47:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Um, just got in my car after work, popped on YSB, and they're playing music.  What's up?  Are you kidding?  What do you mean?  That must be a technical glitch.  Uh, they, uh, they decided to go in another direction, and our, uh, our fans are just outraged,  and I think the big protest is today that's going to shut down the city of Philly.  Yeah.  They've been planning for the last, uh, 24 hours.  It should be just an unbelievable display of outrage today in Philadelphia, or no one's  going to do anything, because that's how it works in radio. 
[00:48:00]  Your favorite show gets kicked off the radio, and there's nothing you can do about it.  Great.  Went in another direction, and we flew out the door.  Yeah.  They turned quickly.  Huh?  Quick question for you.  If I get X7, can I listen to this side, too?  Yeah.  Yeah, this side is broadcast, yes.  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, you can get the whole show, then.  That's just what I'll do, then.  Screw them.  Absolutely.  That's the language, sir.  Yeah.  Yeah, screw them.  Oh, that's a little harsh.  I just wanted to be radio-friendly, boys. 
[00:48:30]  You can also listen to us online there, sir.  There's a bunch of the radio stations we're still on.  They stream the show live online.  All right?  Cool.  I'll go to Circuit City today, my man.  All right.  Thank you, Sean.  Have a good one.  Just move to New York.  Hang in there.  Yeah, there you go.  Just move to New York.  Yeah, the outrage in Philly is just out of control.  Woo!  Woo!  Now, people really are pissed, but the problem is you don't know what to do about it.  No.  In the end, you just don't know what to do.  There's nothing.  But I appreciate the people that are upset and calling the station and at least expressing 
[00:49:00]  themselves.  That's good.  I like that.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's making someone's day miserable, and I like that.  I like that a lot, actually.  Anytime you can make someone's day miserable, I, Opie, am happy.  Especially when it's on the behalf of the show.  Yes, of course.  All right.  We got some other things to do.  After the break, we got the Condi thing, which is really, really interesting.  Oh, yeah.  Someone dropped the ball there.  Really interesting.  And we'll tell you next, Jimmy.  We'll tell you next. 
[00:49:30]  What else we got?  You know, and then there's something going on at our old radio station, WNEW.  They're celebrating 40 years.  40 years.  And we have been left out.  Yeah.  Really?  We might have to talk about that a little bit after the break, though.  For some reason.  It just shows you.  Always left out.  And I know some of these people out there are going to be this old gag, but it just really,  truly shows you how much radio stinks. 
[00:50:00]  It just stinks.  It's the same situation as AAF, because they did a whole retrospective on that station.  Let's explain next.  I think it'll be interesting for some people.  And it might give us an excuse to break out the Carol Miller tapes.  I don't know.  We'll figure it out after the break, okay?  Right.  Opie and Anthony getting ready to give away $1,000.  Hopefully, you know the sound by now.  If not, you're S out of luck today.  I'm sorry.  But this is for the people that need to know the sound every day. 
[00:50:30]  You can go to onaradio.com, and the sound you need to listen for for the $1,000 is up  there posted every day, okay?  Yeah.  But it's too late for today.  I'm sorry.  If you don't know the sound, then...  Oh.  No, no, no.  It's too late.  It's too late.  Screw them.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, we got lots going on today.  It's Opie and Anthony heading to Boston tomorrow for the big Halloween party.  We're going to see a lot of people listening to BCN tomorrow night.  Looking forward to that.  Oh, yeah.  Steven S. from Bayshore. 
[00:51:00]  Could a brush fire break out in Kenny's hair?  We'll tell you about it at 10.  Yeah, Kenny, stay away from the terrorists, will you?  Helicopters flying over his head, dropping water.  I got to tell you, we have the worst timing in radio.  We really do.  The worst.  Oh, do we suck.  We're all over the TV this morning here in New York because they released satellite radio ratings. 
[00:51:30]  Well, it's the first ever Arbitron ratings of satellite radio.  People have been wondering, hey, how are some of these shows doing on satellite radio?  We want to know.  Right.  So they actually rated them and put out some numbers.  And we, again, with nothing but perfect timing on this one. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, do we suck.  We don't look good on this one.  And unfortunately, I really wish David Hickley would call us every once in a while.  We could explain stuff, at least give our spin.  Not even a spin where it's like, well...  Well, sometimes a spin is actual facts.  It really is.  I guess maybe we shouldn't use the word spin because then you think...  Spin is when you take it and you go, well, in the demos, it was positive.  Or in this situation, we were this or that.  This is just a complete fact. 
[00:52:30]  Well, why don't we play the story real fast and then we'll at least give our side of this.  Because, you know, the Stern fans and the ONA fans are just having a ball with this one.  So at least we could throw some fuel on the fire and help out our fans a little bit.  Yeah.  So they have some ammunition in this battle.  Because they're fighting all these crazy battles behind the scenes.  This is what the news is reporting here in New York.  Pretty much every 20 minutes, by the way.  Good morning to Craig and Tiffany. 
[00:53:00]  Well, Howard Stern calls himself the king of all media.  I think for sure we can say he's at least the king of satellite radio.  Arbitron has released its first ever ratings for XM and Sirius.  This covers April through June of this year.  And it shows that in an average week, about 1.2 million listeners at some point did listen to Stern's show.  Now, Arbitron says just one other satellite channel, that's XM's top 20 on 20, tops a million listeners on average.  Now, Opie and Anthony of XM, they average about 216,000 listeners a week. 
[00:53:30]  Opie says that with what Sirius is paying Howard, XM is actually, they're making more money for the company than Stern is making for Sirius.  That looks like, the way she said that is not accurate.  Because it looks like she said to you, well, you guys only have 216,000 and you're responsible.  Well, yeah, we make more money.  That was just not the way it happened.  You expect the news to actually get something right.  She's Eric Logan.  But, yeah, we're trying to get to Logan, but, I mean, really fast, because then we can move on here.  It doesn't look good for your boys, Opie and Anthony.  No, it looks like we have no listeners. 
[00:54:00]  It looks like Howard's kicking our ass in satellite radio.  And the fact is, it's not true.  Just before, well, first of all, it was April to June.  We're just getting the facts out.  Yeah, here's when this took place.  This survey took place was April through June.  And let's see.  The months of April, May.  April, May, and June.  So April, if you recall, we took a vacation. 
[00:54:30]  We took a two-week vacation.  A two-week vacation.  That had everyone in a huge uproar.  And it really pissed off a lot of people where, like, some of our radio stations that were on wanted to dump the show because they couldn't believe we would actually take two weeks.  And satellite radio was thinking the same thing, like, wow, this is not a good time to be taking two weeks.  But whatever.  That shouldn't affect it too much.  But if you know anything about radio, it would affect it a little bit.  Yeah.  But the biggie is then we come back. 
[00:55:00]  And we were on the radio, I think, less than a week.  Less than a week.  Then we had a homeless guy spew some outrageous crap about Condoleezza Rice.  And our satellite radio company there, XM, suspended us for 30 days.  Now, let me explain something.  Not only did they suspend us for 30 days, they took away any Opie and Anthony mention from our channel.  No worse, no worse.  Yeah, it wasn't like they were playing repeats of the show or anything.  This is a month where they pretty much, not pretty much, they took everything that had anything to do with Opie and Anthony off the channel to the point where our hardcore listeners were so outraged, they actually were dumping the service in droves. 
[00:55:30]  It was a big story.  It was a big story.  You can look it up in the news for yourself.  There was a lot of people that canceled their subscriptions.  A lot of people.  So for that survey period, we were off.  Eric Logan, who runs XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:56:00]  Eric, you've got to make it fast, because I'm sure Tom is, like, getting close to choking himself with one of his eyes down the hall.  In a closet looking at pornography.  I'm kidding, Tom.  Listening to in excess music.  Tom has very nice ties.  Elo, make it really fast, please.  Look, I mean, there's so many issues with this thing.  I mean, you're not going to hear either company really comment on the ratings.  The numbers are so skimming.  I could give you, when you get on the XM side, we'll talk a lot about it, but, I mean, there's baseball issues with this thing. 
[00:56:30]  And the bottom line is...  But the day before we got...  The bottom line is, we didn't pay for the service, nor did the competitor pay for the service.  They offered us to buy it.  We didn't want to buy it.  There's many issues with it.  They did not even talk to Satellite Radio subscribers.  This was just people who were listening.  I mean, there's so many issues with this thing.  They didn't talk to all the XM subscribers?  No, no, no.  This survey data was taken by them talking to radio listeners.  They did not even talk to subscribers.  They didn't even research our subscribers. 
[00:57:00]  They just...  It's for people who have a diary, like in New York City, who write down what they're listening to XM.  Never mind the fact that the diary doesn't even have a little column where you can check, because the columns are AM, FM, and that's all it has.  Right, okay.  I mean, I can get into a long...  So it's like a write-in vote?  It's just...  It's silly.  And by the way, that suspension thing, that has a pretty significant part of it.  And if you go get the ratings, I'm sure, from the terrestrial side, if you remember, don't you remember the ratings that went up when you guys were suspended?  Because you were off of Satellite and you went to where? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, my God.  The only place you guys could hear us.  Tom is opening windows down the hall.  He's ready to jump.  There you go.  He's ready to jump, Elo.  You do understand the position we're in where, you know, we work for two companies and you both hate each other, so...  I said, no, no, no, no.  Relax a little bit.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Relax a little bit.  Tom and I cuddled the other night.  It's a privilege for you to be on this side of the Opie and Anthony show.  And I'm going to be very respectful.  So show some respect, sir.  I do, and I love CBS radio.  And why don't you tell everyone how many listeners we have on Satellite? 
[00:58:00]  Like you told us the day before we got in all that trouble.  Watch him say 230,000.  No.  74 listeners.  74.  No, I mean, the number that was told to us, but Elo, for some reason, they're not allowed to talk about it.  The number Elo told us to our face was a lot closer to the number they're showing for Mr. Stern there.  A lot closer.  It's the same number we have today.  And when we get on the XM side, we can talk about it a lot more so Tom doesn't jump out the window.  We'll be happy to do it.  All right.  Thank you, Elo.  Bye, Eric. 
[00:58:30]  See you.  So, I mean, there you go.  But whatever.  I will say I didn't realize that they didn't talk to Satellite subscribers.  I did not realize it.  It's just a weird thing there.  And then the fact that we were off for so much of that period that the survey was done really doesn't put us in the best light.  But people are going to comment.  People are going to bash.  And it doesn't matter what the truth is, reality is.  You throw a little more of the facts out there and whatever.  Maybe it helps.  Maybe it doesn't.  I don't know.  But I'll tell you this much. 
[00:59:00]  The big wigs from Washington flew in.  Their timing was ridiculous.  Were they actually, Obi, giant wigs?  Big wigs.  Because I just picture these giant, various, hairstyled wigs getting off a plane.  And I laugh when I think about that.  Did they take the jetway?  Did they have to take the stairs to the runway?  Did they go through security?  Yeah.  Big wigs got off the plane.  Big wigs.  Okay.  They're all like Flo from the Alice show.  Yeah.  Big beehive wigs. 
[00:59:30]  And they sat us down.  Eight big wigs.  And they showed us how well we're doing for them.  Yeah.  And it was quite impressive.  And it was over a million.  It has to be said today because we look dumb in the press.  It was over a million.  And they were like, you guys should be proud of yourself and what you've accomplished, blah,  blah, blah.  And then as they took us to lunch to celebrate the fact that they had nothing but good news  that they flew up for to show us.  Yeah.  And everyone's blackberries were going nuts with news that we were on the front page of 
[01:00:00]  the Drudge Report and our lives drastically changed like that.  We went from heroes to, oh my God, do we even have a job?  To goats.  To goats.  That's right, my friends.  Yeah.  That's right.  Uh, Condoleezza Rice.  A little protester got right in her face with bloody hands.  Wow.  That was...  Not real bloody hands, but a little red paint makes it look like bloody hands.  It was amazing how close this woman got to the Secretary of State.  Like, how the hell did that happen? 
[01:00:30]  Someone dropped the ball there.  Heads must have been rolling.  Well, you can sometimes have they walk through crowds, though, like when the president shakes  hands or whatever.  Yeah, but this was a very...  Like, someone should have seen this woman was a problem and she was getting very close.  Yeah, how do you get to hang around with her?  To this, uh...  With bloody slash red painted hands.  Yeah.  And no one's noticing.  That's what I think Anne's getting at.  It wasn't like just a casual person, like, decided, oh, wow, I can say something.  I'm this close. 
[01:01:00]  The lady, look at the picture in the paper.  They were bloody red hands.  Yeah, but she was also cranky, so they put two and two together and went, ah, well, we  know what's going on.  Yeah.  Her quote was, Condoleezza Rice, do you have a tampon?  I feel fat.  I feel fat.  Man, Condoleezza Rice, you can read her mind.  She is livid.  And she's...  Of course she is.  She's looking at her like, don't even.  She wants to tell this woman off so badly.  She wants to...  I think some of her street was going to come out.  I was going to say, she wants to go ghetto on this broad. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Little urban.  She wants to go a bit ghetto on this broad.  Yep.  But here's the story.  A lot of millions of Americans are on their hands, miles, and I'm not there again until  we go.  Chantle, chantle.  War criminal.  War criminal.  War criminal.  War criminal.  See, this is the raw audio, obviously.  So Condoleezza Rice is getting ready to what?  Sit down and talk about the war somewhere else in the world?  Who has the bit where they talk about how Condoleezza Rice, all she does is just go 
[01:02:00]  around the world, waving, getting on planes, and just talking about the war?  And then there might be a picture of her sitting at that little round table with the other  person sitting on the other side of it.  With the microphone in front of her?  Yeah.  And then they just go away again.  Somewhere else she's off.  Who had the bit?  It was brilliant.  It was a brilliant observation that she just goes all around the world and she just waves  from the top of the stairs as she's getting into a plane, and that's pretty much  her job.  They simplified her job.  I said, you know what's awful about this woman, too, is not the fact that she's put 
[01:02:30]  in red paint, but the fact that when people see you get the blood of millions of Iraqis,  it's like, what do you think Saddam Hussein, and I don't care about the Iraqis, but it's  like, what do you think he was doing?  What's the matter with you?  And the blood of Iraqis, well, regardless of how you feel about the war, it is a war.  I mean, what the hell are you going to do?  You kill people.  It's called a war.  The code pink shirt's a giveaway, though.  Women for peace.  How do you let someone with a code pink shirt... 
[01:03:00]  That close.  I bet she had the paint with her.  She probably didn't walk around with red paint in her hands all day.  Yeah.  I'm a bingo player!  See, I thought it was one of...  I thought it was an American or something when I saw it real quickly, and then I realized  she's, like, you know, protesting for the other side there.  Yeah.  Here's more raw audio.  More protesters after, I guess, they got rid of her.  Yes.  Yes.  You're hurting me. 
[01:03:30]  Arresting you.  Arresting you.  Arresting you.  Arresting you.  How are you?  Yeah.  It's great to see you.  Did someone just come up?  Condoleezza, hi!  It's great to see you.  As someone's getting tased in the background.  Ah, what are you doing?  Well, I'm hearing that that's actually her saying it's great to see you. 
[01:04:00]  As she's sitting down getting ready to do what she's going to do.  Really?  I don't know.  I thought I heard someone say, oh, Condoleezza.  Oh, you do hear that at the end?  I think I did.  Maybe we got it wrong.  I think I did.  I think I did.  Let me go to the end of the clip again here.  Oh, how are you?  Yeah, it's great to see you.  Thank you.  Maybe she said something else.  Maybe it was like, ah, Lisa or something.  Yeah, I don't know.  That was good, though. 
[01:04:30]  It was just the screams of pain.  And what are you doing in the background?  And then she's just sitting down like nothing is happening.  I love it.  It's so weird when I see that stuff.  Why can't you acknowledge that?  Never.  They never do.  They just kind of.  As a human being, wouldn't you be like, wow, that's pretty crazy?  Like have some kind of reaction?  I'd be like, how did that person get that close to me?  Or something.  Do you know who I am?  Like a robot just continuing with what she has to do that day.  That's how they operate. 
[01:05:00]  Mary, Massachusetts.  How are you, Mary?  Hey, I'm doing great.  How are you?  Good.  Why are you calling the Opie and Anthony show?  Well, I thought I heard you guys play, I bring nothing to the table in the background  there when you're talking about your meeting with the big wigs.  Ah.  And you're a big fan of the Opie and Anthony show, are you?  Oh, don't start with me.  I heard you picking on my friend Andrea the other day.  Oh, can't get anything by you.  They do travel in packs.  The fact that you heard a sound that wasn't played. 
[01:05:30]  Mary, big fan of the show?  I just told you, biggest, the biggest fan.  I love to listen to you when you talk about going through traffic and, you know, y'all.  Listen, Mary, you're making a lot of people laugh if they've been following this bit.  We talked about that today.  I love it.  We talked about that today.  How about something we talked about last week?  No, not even last week, because she's probably been listening since the prize contest.  How you hated kids.  How you hated kids, because they're dumb. 
[01:06:00]  That was also during the contest period.  Yeah.  You've got to go back at least a month.  Yeah, what's the...  Go back a little bit.  What?  You guys, how do you expect to get listeners if you treat them like crap?  Okay.  See, she doesn't know that.  If you knew the show, you'd know we treat our listeners like crap.  Yeah, even the faithful listeners get a nice punch in the face every once in a while.  Accept it, Mary.  Accept it as...  Mary, how long have you been listening?  Let's just have a little honesty here.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  How long have you been listening? 
[01:06:30]  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Okay.  All right.  See?  We like that.  It's honesty.  See, I respect that.  I really do respect that instead of, like, some of these prize pigs that are, like, trying  to make believe they've been listening for years.  Two weeks.  You've missed a lot of great radio, Mary.  Yeah.  Do you...  I do get a few kicks out of you, and I did get stories from my son.  He listens to you guys all the time, so he's always going, you're not going to believe  what they did.  Okay.  Hey, Mary, here's the sound you're supposed to be listening for. 
[01:07:00]  It's this.  You got it, Ant?  Yeah.  I bring nothing to the table.  Yeah.  You better hang up so you get a chance to win this contest, Mary.  What are you doing?  What are you waiting for?  Go!  I'm dialing with my other phone.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  She is a pro.  Oh, and she's gone.  She is gone.  She probably got a busy signal on that phone.  Now she's trying again.  Let the record show I did not hang up on her.  Mary had to hang up quickly to try to win the thousand. 
[01:07:30]  Yes.  All right.  We'll get that winner as we go to break here.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Let's go to Chris in New Hampshire really fast here.  Hey, Chris.  What's going on, buddy?  Hey, Joe.  Guys, just commuting into work.  And you just won $1,000?  Outstanding.  Yep.  Very, very cool.  What station are you listening on?  BCM.  Oh, cool.  We're going to be up there tomorrow night for the big Halloween party.  I think we're going to be on Touch Your Riches show tomorrow afternoon. 
[01:08:00]  And we're doing a little dinner.  And then we're doing the Halloween thing at the Hard Rock.  So congratulations, Chris.  Yeah, I just want to see old Dirty come back.  What happened to that guy?  I think he's in jail.  I think he's doing like 30 to life.  Yeah.  Oh, bummer.  Can you get an email from him at least?  We have, we've tried to like find some of these older guys from the other show.  And most of them are just lost.  They've scattered.  We can't find half these people. 
[01:08:30]  Remember PR?  He emailed me.  He said, okay, I don't remember where he's living now, but a lot of the guys don't live  in New York anymore.  Yeah, PR was like old Dirty's sidekick.  And old Dirty was just the real deal, man.  He was, as far as the hood goes, he knew what was going on.  He'd give us all the info.  He's a laid back guy in the world.  Huh?  He was so laid back.  He was awesome.  Yeah, he was great, man.  Yeah.  I loved when he came in and just would tell us the latest scams going on in the neighborhood.  Latest scams, man.  He was the one that told us about how he would rip off the tops of the parking meters.  That one, I remember. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  With a big pipe cutter.  Yeah.  And they would just go around and around and rip the top of the parking meters off.  But then we asked him, we're like, well, then you have the tops of all these parking meters.  How do you get into the inside?  I forgot what he said, but then he told us.  Yeah.  It was pretty impressive.  He knew a little bit about everything.  Yeah.  As far as stealing.  A little change.  Yeah.  All right, Chris.  Congratulations with the $1,000 up there in New Hampshire.  No problem.  Thanks a lot, fellas.  All right, man.  Keep listening.  Thanks, Chris.  We'll have tomorrow's sound in a few minutes. 
[01:09:30]  Maybe.  How about Than picks one today?  Than?  Good idea.  Pick out the next sound for us.  The latest on the Southern California wildfire is just getting an email here.  Property damage just in San Diego County totals over a billion dollars.  That's in just San Diego County alone.  At least 1,500 homes across Southern California have been reduced to smoldering ruins.  And this is what makes me just laugh.  If President Bush will make a 240 statement after viewing the destruction, please tape that. 
[01:10:00]  Please tape that.  Fire.  What I've seen is devastating destruction of property and displaced people's lives.  All right.  Yeah.  And we want Governor Schwarzenegger to know that the federal government's commitment to the state of California is blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  It's going to be just a robotic speech. 
[01:10:30]  Dillon!  Shakes hands with the president.  Ha, ha, eh, eh.  Does that manly Conan handshake where you grab the forearms.  Didn't he go nowhere near?  Bush went nowhere near downtown New Orleans.  Oh, yeah.  Didn't he send somebody?  He flew over a couple weeks later, I think.  Mississippi?  Yeah.  I think he took a space shuttle flight and took a look that way.  And took a look that way as the space shuttle was orbiting around the Earth. 
[01:11:00]  Hey, I got something for Anthony here.  Listen closely.  Over 100 million Americans keep guns in their homes for protection.  The Second Amendment to the Constitution guarantees all Americans the right to keep and bear arms.  But these arms must be accessible.  The patented backup gun rack keeps your shotgun at your bedside and is easily...  Wow.  Ooh.  Tell me more.  Well, you were saying the other day you got guns laying all around the house. 
[01:11:30]  I got guns all over the joint.  No better way.  Shouldn't you lock up some of the guns?  Really?  I have no need to.  I don't have children.  There were no children around.  Oh, that's right.  You hate children.  Yeah.  Why would I?  $39.  Yes?  You walk into his bedroom and there's just like a shotgun leaning up against the wall in a corner with the laundry.  That's my position.  It's my tactical position.  I can roll out of bed, grab the gun, and actually have great cover by my closet and the laundry. 
[01:12:00]  Behind what?  You're going to hide behind the folded sheets?  You're going to hide behind a quilt?  Don't shoot me.  You cannot penetrate this quilt.  And I bet you...  My cloak of invisibility.  I bet you you've practiced your move a few times.  Never practice the roll move.  The roll out of bed, grab the gun.  No.  Point and shoot.  I've actually had to grab the gun once.  What?  Well, I wasn't sure what the sound was downstairs. 
[01:12:30]  What?  It was a very loud sound.  I wasn't sure what it was.  Please, for the love of God, be careful.  I don't want to hear that you killed your own mother because she came over with a gun.  Mommy knows not to come over.  With a housewarming gift.  After she was grazed the first time, she knows, don't bother coming over.  You're playing army.  Yeah.  He's playing army.  He's playing a little fort built all over.  A fort.  I'll meet you behind sofa six.  I stopped over at his house two weeks ago on a Sunday, and he didn't answer the door. 
[01:13:00]  And I have keys to the house, and I went in, and I was with my wife.  Why would you go into his house if he's not answering?  Are you stupid?  You're a cop, you eat.  He's armed, too, so at least it's a fair fight.  We had to make potty.  So we went in, and we heard him downstairs in the basement, and Andrew was just begging  me, please, please call him and let him know we're in the house before he shoots us.  He's probably shooting something in the basement.  Please, please.  No, I wasn't.  I was shooting something, but with a video camera.  Lately, we've been talking about Apocalypse Now and Marlon Brando at the end of Apocalypse  Now.  Anthony is slowly becoming that character. 
[01:13:30]  No.  Slowly but surely, he's becoming that character.  I am just well defended.  Sure are.  I'm well protected.  I am exercising my Second Amendment right to bear arms, and I do it to the umpteenth.  Yeah, no kidding.  Yeah.  I like being armed to the teeth.  It's amazing.  You're exercising a right for all the people that aren't.  It's great.  I could even go commie.  I could go commie.  I got an AK-47 if I want.  I'll load that sucker up. 
[01:14:00]  Nice 30-round banana clip.  That's great.  Well, now we got it.  Now, when I want to go American, I go my AR.  Well, now we got a gun rack for you that you can put, what, right on the back of your bed?  Yeah, on the side of the bed.  On the side.  Let's listen in.  Sure, so you can probably reach down and just fondle it.  This is for Anthony.  Must be accessible.  The patented backup gun rack keeps your shotgun at your bedside and is easily hidden by blankets  and sheets.  The patented backup device slides easily between your mattress and box spring and mounts  your shotgun flush at your bedside, enabling access to your shotgun while in the lying position 
[01:14:30]  in your bed.  For only $39.95, you can own the backup to make your guns accessible to you when you  need them, yet hidden and out of the way when you don't.  For only $39.95, you'll get the valuable time that may be needed to adequately protect  you and your home.  It's the smartest money you'll spend in your life.  Get up now and call the number on your screen.  Make your firearms accessible by ordering the backup.  It's adjustable to fit any shotgun.  Many customers are buying one for each side of the bed. 
[01:15:00]  Call or go online.  The backup is not intended for use in homes with children.  That sounds great.  I'm going to order that.  Yeah.  Where's the phone?  Ow!  Oh, damn it!  Oh, my foot!  Hey, if Steve's listening, can we put that commercial up on onaradio.com later today?  The backup.  Yeah, look at where that thing goes.  You can check it out right now if you go to YouTube.  The new backup commercial.  It's up there for you.  You could pretty much just put your arm down, lift your arm a little, and fire right through 
[01:15:30]  your blanket at somebody.  That's good, though, because it's one on either side of the bed is important, too, because  you never know where you're going to be sleeping when the burglar is right there.  That's true.  You could be on one side of the bed and wake up and go, uh-oh, I think he's on the other  side of the bed.  And for an extra $10, you get the backup deluxe where you can sleep with the gun duct taped  to your arm.  What's the matter with these people?  The guy sounded pretty happy about the whole thing, too.  You'll be killing people before you know it.  For an extra $10, put chocolate sauce on the muzzle so the little tot goes over and takes 
[01:16:00]  a little taste.  And the big patriotic music playing in the background.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I'd like to see...  You know something?  Man, laugh your goddamn heads off, because I bet if somebody came into your house, a home  invasion, you'd be sitting there going, if only I had this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then you'd be like, oh, boy, what am I going to...  All right.  They're coming up the stairs. 
[01:16:30]  What am I going to do?  Aranoia.  9-1-1.  Hello?  Can I...  Aranoia.  Yes.  9-1-1.  I think...  All right.  It's over, Johnny.  What about the intruders getting some of the guns that you have laying around downstairs  and everywhere else?  Or are they strategically located that they're not going to find them?  My guns move around the house.  If I know I'm going to be spending a lot of time downstairs, then the gun will join me  downstairs.  He's insane.  If I'm upstairs, then the gun's upstairs, so that way, when there's somebody downstairs, 
[01:17:00]  they're not going to use my gun against me.  I would never want to see a home invasion happen to you, but do you bring one into the  bathroom when you're on the bull?  Um, no, no, uh, shower.  If I have to shower and I'm alone in the house, I will probably take something small into the  bathroom with me.  For an extra $20, get the Negro Identifier.  Have it put on your front door so you see one when they're walking up. 
[01:17:30]  What's the matter with these people?  Did you read about the guy who was in the shower, a home invasion happened, and there  he is, wet, soapy, and naked, getting the crap beat out of him?  Great.  Why?  Well, then, what's the big deal if you take a gun with you into the shower?  Did you read about the other 300 million people that that didn't happen to?  Well, I was going to go with that.  Ain't going to be me.  Hold on.  I was going to go with that.  I've also read about the guy that won the lottery.  That ain't happened to me either.  Not in the shower.  Do you not go to the bathroom because a snake pops up through the toilet once in a while? 
[01:18:00]  I don't care about snakes popping up through the toilet.  And rats come up from the toilet, too.  Rats, that's fine.  I care about home invasions.  I care about criminals and crime and rapists and robbers.  Those are the people that are not going to make any headway.  Their career in crime will end at my front door.  End. 
[01:18:30]  Let's go to Max.  Thank you.  Max, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hi.  Hey, Ope, I think you could have used that thing when that black dude tried to rape you  up in Buffalo.  All right.  You're longer.  All right.  Why do you have to bring up a very embarrassing time for me?  I don't know if I had a gun, what I would have done in that situation.  He ran.  The guy ran.  And by the way, for the new listeners, I did not get raped by a black guy, okay?  No.  But he was taking a very close look. 
[01:19:00]  It was consensual.  He tried to claim rape, but there's no signs of struggle.  You even opened the door and there's a flower on the bed.  It's not gay if you think you're going to be raped.  You're right.  Right.  You're right.  I'm with you.  Jesus.  If you're doing it to prevent a punch in the jaw, you're just pushing back quickly  to get him out of there.  Right.  There's nothing gay about it.  There you go.  In fact, you're still all men.  Steve, Philly, what's up?  Yo.  Hey, O.N., man.  Hey.  I can't stand this frigging city, man. 
[01:19:30]  They took you guys off the air on this precedent, Steve.  They suck.  They completely suck.  I hope you guys come back somewhere in Philly.  Well, I hope.  Well, see, we're not even talking to our audience down there that is pissed off because the ones  that were, whatever, Philly people are still listening to the show in other ways, but I  wish I could talk to the people.  Like, they are really pissed, and they don't know what to do about it.  I'd love to have the Philly people involved in the gun conversation.  They like their guns over there, too.  Oh, boy, do they.  Kill Adelphia, they were calling. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah, the murder rate down there.  They called it Kill Adelphia.  Ridiculous.  But, Steve, I don't know.  It's time to start calling the other stations down there.  We will do everything we can to get back on the air in Philly sooner than later.  But Bob's too busy negotiating the deal for our replacement down there.  So, I guess when he's done with that, then he'll figure out what we could do with the  Philly situation.  All right, man.  All right, Steve. 
[01:20:30]  Thank you.  Which just amazes me.  But what are you going to do?  If I start thinking about that stuff, I'll go nuts.  All right.  Well, I mean, there's just tons of Philly calls coming in every day.  We were doing well, too, today.  That just infuriates me.  That situation is driving me nuts when I'm not here.  Just driving me nuts.  And that's why I don't have a gun.  See? 
[01:21:00]  Bring it back to the gun thing.  Some people are responsible enough that they can handle a gun in their life.  It's like a recovering alcoholic knows can't have one drink.  Right.  So, somebody with a gun problem shouldn't have guns.  My lovely fiancÃ©e has been babysitting me the last couple of days.  Really?  I don't know how many times I've heard, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, Jesus.  As I'm picking up things and I just want to throw them. 
[01:21:30]  I can't tell you how many times in the last couple of days I heard, no, no, no, no, no.  And then it snaps me out.  I'll be like, oh, yeah, okay, okay, okay.  Okay, calm down.  All right.  All right, take a deep breath.  So, I guess I wouldn't do well with a gun in my house.  No.  I only hear, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  The things are going on in the bedroom and she's on her stomach.  Like, come on.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm not that tired.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Well, we'll have our day in Philly to prove a lot of thanks. 
[01:22:00]  A lot of thanks.  Yeah.  Wow.  I am doing some heavy breathing right now.  All right.  Just.  We've got to leave these things at the studio door.  Well, you don't think that if, like, Howard got taken off a market, Buckwald would be negotiating  for the replacement?  Thank you, Jimmy.  Thank you for getting it.  Thank you.  Our agent is negotiating the deal for our replacement and he thinks there's no problem 
[01:22:30]  with that.  If I could play the devil's advocate, it is his client.  Well, he did.  I don't know what he was supposed to.  What was he supposed to do?  Say, um, I can't represent you?  Yeah.  Really?  I would.  Just drop him as a client.  Yeah.  I don't want to be one of many in a stable of, uh, clients.  Yeah, absolutely.  I would say, wow, this is a little too tough.  Uh, Opie and Anthony have made me a bloody fortune in the last 10 years.  And because of Opie, don't get me started, really, because this is going to get ugly. 
[01:23:00]  Opie and Anthony, uh, have also turned a lot of, uh, a lot of clients onto, onto Mr.  Uh, Eatman over the years because of our success.  Yeah.  I would absolutely say, wow, this is, this is a rough one, man.  These guys have made me a bloody fortune.  And absolutely, I would, I would, I would step away from this one.  Absolutely.  He doesn't need all those clients.  We make them a bloody effing fortune.  And if he focused just on our, our careers, he would make even more money instead of dealing  with, uh, you know, smaller shows all over the country. 
[01:23:30]  Don't get me started.  Seriously.  It's infuriating.  We got kicked off in Philly.  I think you're started already.  I know.  I know.  I know.  And I'm trying to be better.  Trust me.  But it's enraging.  We should never have been kicked off of Philly.  And now we got to sit back and watch him negotiate the deal for our replacement.  That's insane.  That is insane in my world.  Insane. 
[01:24:00]  It's insane.  And the best he could tell me is, well, someone was going to do the deal.  Oh, great.  That's, that's the answer I want after 10 years of, uh, making you a bloody fortune.  For what?  I don't even know.  I really don't know.  Because when the going gets tough, he sure isn't around.  Oh, he's up.  His advice is like, oh, you guys got to get the ratings up in Philly.  That's the best thing you can tell us when things are going weird.  Oh, God.  You got to get, you got to get the ratings up in Philly.  Oh, my God. 
[01:24:30]  I'm going to actually have to work if you don't do that.  He's an agent.  I'm trying to figure something out.  Oh, he's an agent.  Oh.  He negotiates deals.  And then, and then gets a lot of money to sit back and watch things just kind of get a little weird.  If, if we got a, like a manager, well, then I could see, well, a manager would do like something like that.  An agent, well, an agent contractually, all he is supposed to do is like, well, I wanted to do more than just that, but he hasn't. 
[01:25:00]  Okay, trust me, the manager thing is, is going to happen now because I, you can't sit back and watch this crap happen.  You know, who's watching out for our best interest?  He's not.  You're not watching out for our best interest when, when you watch the Philly thing happen and then you negotiate the deal with the guy that's going to replace Opie and Anthony.  That's not watching out for my best interest.  I deserve a little more with the money we pay him.  A lot more.  Hey, Halloween tips.  Halloween right around the corner. 
[01:25:30]  Less than a week away, right?  It's down to five or six days.  We'll have to agree to disagree, man, but who's disagreeing?  No, Anthony's another way.  And I, I just see things a little differently as far as the situation goes.  It happens.  Where it's, it's, it's, it's an insult.  I'm in the middle.  Like, you're both correct.  He is an agent that is technically his job.  I mean, honestly, it is.  However, it would, it would, it does.  It's an insult.  Instead of, instead of trying to get a new gig,  do you concentrate on this? 
[01:26:00]  But then again, it is kind of his livelihood.  It's, there's, no one's wrong with it.  It's like both points are very right.  He's completely wrong.  I haven't heard from him in over a day.  Like, what is he doing about the Philly situation?  Is he contacting the other stations?  What is he doing?  Seriously, what is he doing?  But he doesn't have time because he's negotiating the deal for a replacement.  That's insane to me.  I'm sorry.  It's insane to me.  I talked to him last night and he, he has spoken with a few people in Philly.  Oh, well.  But they, um.  I get to find out live in the air.  That's fun.  Oh, but he's doing his job, right? 
[01:26:30]  That's a guy doing his job, right?  I find out from Anthony live on the air that he has spoken to people down there.  He said you hung up on him.  Yeah, and I will continue hanging up.  Well, that's probably why you don't know.  So send me an email.  Send me an email.  Yeah, I did hang up on him and I will continue.  He's gotten 10% of my money for a long time.  When the going gets tough, this is where he has to finally work.  He hasn't worked in a long time except for negotiating his deal every once in a while.  And guess what?  Guess what, Ant?  The reason his job's so easy is because we have an effing great show. 
[01:27:00]  Oh, I know that.  It's not like, you know, he's pulling a magic act here.  We're a commodity.  People want this radio show.  It makes his job so effing easy.  So all I ask is when the going gets tough, he shows something and he shows nothing.  And I'm so sick of like, you know, being disrespected by people.  Like he's showing that we're just one of many in his stable.  That's not what I signed on for when we got him as an agent. 
[01:27:30]  So he's talked to people.  That's good to know.  Well, he's talked to people that, you know.  All right, just people.  Yeah.  That we've had dealings with before.  All right.  They hate us, though.  No, no.  We're still beloved.  Is there a peak of interest?  Well, I'll discuss that part off the air.  And by the way. 
[01:28:00]  We're going urban.  And by the way, just to make a point and to show pretty much the world I'm insane.  I am working for free in Philly and Bob gets 10% of zero.  And that's where it's going to hurt him.  The way it is with my deal.  Thanks, Dan.  I will get great happiness in that.  I'm working for free when we get back to Philadelphia Radio.  If they want to pay after we become number one or negotiate that, whatever, fine. 
[01:28:30]  But I want to work for free in Philadelphia Radio.  I don't need the money.  And I want to see Bob take 10% of zero.  And then I will finally be happy.  And then we can maybe start working together again.  But I'm working for free.  And people think, well, Opie's working for free down in Philly because they have to pay him out.  No, I'm working for free as we move forward.  Stop trying to spin my crap, okay?  My crap is very easy.  Just listen with your stupid ears and stop spinning my crap on message boards. 
[01:29:00]  I want to work for free in Philly Radio.  That's what I want to do to show that I still have the passion for this.  Don't spin it.  Well, the reason is, really, are you in my life?  Am I calling you at home?  No.  My crap is my crap.  Remember, my crap is my crap.  Right.  When I say something, that's it.  Don't spin it. 
[01:29:30]  That's it.  I don't even know if we get paid to the end of the contract.  I really don't.  I don't care.  I want to work in Philly Radio for free.  And I want to sit back and watch Bobby get an aneurysm because he realized he's making 10% of zero.  And then everyone could whisper behind my back that I'm insane.  Great.  I don't care.  That's what I do now because I'm infuriated with that situation.  The other stations we lost, I told Tom yesterday and other people in corporate, I get it. 
[01:30:00]  I understand how this business works.  But the Philly situation is so ridiculous.  I want to be on the radio by Monday.  I don't want to wait.  I don't want to wait until Bob negotiates the deal for our replacement and then gets back to us.  I want it to happen now.  And I want to do it for free.  For free.  10% of zero.  Enjoy that one, Bob.  Halloween tips next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Feeling better. 
[01:30:30]  Quick electric shock in the bathroom and I'm back, boys and girls.  You're right as rain.  Thank you, E-Rod.  I needed this.  Everybody, let's let this kick in here.  a bit.  Thank you.  Yay.  I'm so excited.  Bye. 
[01:31:00]  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Yes, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  I needed that, E-Rock.  Thank you very, very, very, very much.  That's Drew Boogie. 
[01:31:30]  That's an amazing piece of production.  Anthony has tomorrow's sound for the contest.  Another $1,000 to give away tomorrow.  What's the sound?  Here's the sound.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  That is the sound.  All right.  That was a nice setup.  So when you hear that tomorrow between 7 and 7.30, if you're the 10th caller, you're going to win the next $1,000.  And that sound will be up on onaradio.com just in case you don't listen one day and you want to know what the sound is or whatever, whatever that means. 
[01:32:00]  All right.  A lot of gun owners checking in.  A lot of disgruntled listeners checking in.  Where to go?  Sarah, what's up?  Only they could join forces.  Gentlemen, how are you?  I have no reason to be getting up anymore.  I emailed you.  I'd like to take a holotip bullet in my mouth before I listen to Preston and Steve.  Oh, she did it.  Literally?  Jesus. 
[01:32:30]  I mean, it's like pollution in Philadelphia, and we're not all ugly.  I know.  All of us love you.  Hey, I brought the average way down when I picked a pretty one from Philly.  Oh, isn't that adorable?  I'm a huge fan, and I'm kind of smoking.  I mean, I get some attention from guys, so I'm a huge fan, and my heart is broken.  Hey, Sarah, you know what?  Yeah.  I would like to see, I'm not going to lie to you, I would like to see a little passion 
[01:33:00]  from the Philly audience down there, you know, express your frustration.  It would make me very, very happy.  Maybe call some of these other radio stations and see if there's an interest in the Opie and  Anthony show.  I want the YSP building to look like that last helicopter going out of Vietnam.  I would have no problem.  I have a blazer.  I will install a turret, and I will rampage WISP.  I will never listen to those loonies again.  They suck.  And I'm amazed that all of Philadelphia buys into Preston and Steve's crap. 
[01:33:30]  I think they're retarded.  We were doing okay.  We were on our way.  I mean, you know, this was a long fight, and we were in for the long haul, but I guess  they weren't.  My husband works an hour away, and the only reason I drive him to work is to listen to  you.  So to my dismay yesterday, in the gray morning at 7...  Do we still have O&A pass?  I hope we do.  Maybe they could... 
[01:34:00]  I like when they show their intelligence, by the way.  I'm more for that.  But it is very, very, very frustrating what happened to us in Philly, and we're going  to do everything we can to get back on the Philly airwaves.  Yeah, by the way, getting back to that, I made that joke all weekend.  Obnoxiously, knowing it was a stupid joke, but I'm like, we were reading the article  about how Philly's like one of the ugliest cities in America.  No, the ugliest city in America.  Yeah.  And I made the joke that I took the pretty one out of Philly and dropped the average  drastically.  That's a good scene in the show, like where you make the joke, and you both just kind of 
[01:34:30]  look at each other like you laugh.  It's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wait, what did my girlfriend do laughing?  Oh, it was so awful.  She wanted me to kiss her mouth while she laughed.  Oh, yeah, she's like, kiss me while I'm laughing.  I don't want to.  And she's going, ha, ha, ha, ha, kiss me while I'm laughing.  Like, I don't want to kiss you.  But we're in a restaurant, and she won't shut up until I kiss her.  While she's laughing.  Oh, it's so annoying because she's like, ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm like, all right, shut up. 
[01:35:00]  That and she makes me open my mouth  So she can make animal noises into my mouth  Really?  Yeah, like I'll open my mouth and she'll go  And she claws into my stupid mouth  She's sort of crazy  She's a real kook  You've got like kind of a crazy chick  Yeah, she's out of her mind  In a good way though  Yeah, it's fun  Yeah, it's really good when you're trying to have a nice quiet meal  I'm like, we're in a five star restaurant  Kiss me while I'm laughing  It's like dating a retard  By the way, we had to cancel phone call Thursday today 
[01:35:30]  It was crucial to just hang up on everyone calling in for phone call Thursday  We've got to kind of try to keep the lines open for other things today  Other things  It's amazing the volume of calls coming in the last few days  And we appreciate the support Philly  But see, they're not hearing that  That's what's so silly about saying what I just said  Hey, Halloween tips  We're doing this because it just kind of like  Shows how ridiculous the local news is 
[01:36:00]  We get to point and laugh at them  Every year they do their Halloween stories  And it's just nonsense  It's the same stories, first of all  And then second of all, they're just stupid  Although I respect Channel 11  Because they did the chicks wearing really hot costume fashion show thing the other day  That was really good  That was different  Just the hottest Halloween costumes for really hot chicks  That was something that was enjoyable to watch  Instead of telling everybody out there to check their apples for razor blades 
[01:36:30]  And pins  Speaking of Channel 11, tomorrow's the big day  E-Rock, you ready?  E-Rock's going to be on Channel 11 tomorrow  You're in New York doing Dance Friday  And for the rest of the country, don't worry  We'll get the video and we'll get it up on onaradio.com  So you can laugh too  You getting nervous, E-Rock?  A little butterflies going on?  Yeah, a little bit  Yeah?  And what song you dancing to on live TV tomorrow?  I don't think we get to pick the song  I think they  Oh, there's probably somebody that gets paid to pick it  He's nervous, he's getting butter sticks 
[01:37:00]  Is Master Poe going with you?  Yes  Oh no!  You gotta get Poe dancing  Yeah  You have to  And you guys gotta wear some Opie and Anthony stuff  This might start the whole assault on the media  Okay, that's hysterical  You and Poe are going in  Poe is apparently going to teach everyone at Channel 11 how to dance  Oh, I love it  This is fantastic  God, there's a God  Yeah  It couldn't be better  It couldn't be  Poe always listens to this show 
[01:37:30]  And who was  I think E-Rock said that he looks like  He was dancing the other day  And he looks like Thriller  Yeah  Like the zombie dance from Thriller  What time are you dancing tomorrow?  I think we're on at 7.30  7.30  Oh, pinpoint listening  Oh, yes  That's very important  Pinpoint listening  Just do a good show  How about that?  Which we do, by the way  And by the way  We all miss the fact that Eric should have his face slapped  For when you said what time are you dancing  He should have said  I don't know, it's about 7.30 
[01:38:00]  He's like, well, I think we're on at 7.30  As if you've been in many makeup rooms  And had many rehearsals  And you just know what time show time is  Yeah, that's the approximate time they gave us  I understand that  But the way you phrased it  Made me want to dip my hand in warm oil  And slap your face  We're going to simulcast  We're going to simulcast Dance Friday  With our own E-Rock and Master Poe tomorrow  On the Opie and Anthony show  Hopefully around 7.30  Alright, so  This is the latest Halloween tips coming in  I want to thank everybody  Across America for sending in their local news 
[01:38:30]  Doing Halloween tips  Hot oil  Warm oil  Warm oil  What you do is  It bubbles a little bit  And you soak your hand in it  And you clean shave him first  You dry shave him  Right  So his face is kind of  Shaving and smooth  And you get like  You line it up  And you gently pat his cheek with oil  So there's good friction  And then you go  Ouch  A crispy slap  Alright, ready for Halloween tips? 
[01:39:00]  Yes  Okay  Listen closely  This is your news  Believe it or not  Halloween just 8 days away  Believe it or not  Halloween 8 days away  Why believe it or not?  You have to look at a calendar  Right  Halloween's been on the same date  For as long as I remember  October 31st  Let's have a little fun  Raise your hand out there  If you were thinking to yourself  Wow, believe it or not  Halloween 8 days away  Hmm 
[01:39:30]  No  Hands  Anyone  And no  That's an interesting thing to say  If it's like July 11th  Yeah  Right  My god, I don't believe it  It really snuck up on us this year  Did it?  I don't even  Did it sneak up?  Is it going to be on the 30th?

[01:50:00]  Talking about for  Off and off  For a couple weeks  And we go to Snopes  Halloween poisonings  Oh  The news scares  The crap out of you  Every year  Read that label  Let me just get through  This Jimmy  And then we'll go  Back to that  We're all over the place  And that's fine  Jimmy's just laughing  Go ahead  Go ahead  It says  It's berry burst  Cheerios  It's like  How badly do you need  Good taste  What's wrong with it  Nothing  Oh jeez  Yeah 
[01:50:30]  Your berries just burst  Oh  Sorry  E are you going to  Take that  E  E  E to the R  E to the rock  There's nothing  I can do to him  Oh  I don't have a five  Oh well  That's sad  Halloween poisonings  Police have documented  Cases of mad men  Randomly distributing  Poison goodies  To the little tykes  Who came calling 
[01:51:00]  On Halloween  I'm big into this one  Okay  Because the news  Scares the crap  Out of the parents  Every single year  Status  According to Snopes  False  Tales of black  Hearted mad men  Doling out poison  Halloween candy  To unsuspecting  Little tykes  Have been around  Forever  They were part  Of my Halloween  Experience nearly  40 years ago  And every year  Sees the same  Flurry of activity  In response to such  Rumors  Radio  TV  And newspapers  Issue dark  Warnings  About  Tampered candy  And suggest  Taking the little  Ones to parties 
[01:51:30]  Instead of  Collecting goodies  Door to door  And that's what  Has happened  Now all the  Trick-or-treating  Is really safe  In malls  Or in the middle  Of town  Or in the  Lobby of buildings  Even in  Lander's  Publish a column  In 1995  Warning us  Against a mad  Poisoner  Saying  In recent years  There have been  Reports of people  With twisted minds  Putting razor blades  And poison  In taffy apples  And Halloween candy  E-Rock  I know you love  Pal talk  But you gotta  Thank you  Jesus  He's right in the 
[01:52:00]  Middle of reading  Something  And I see a naked  Girl  Thanks  I love naked  Women  But you know  We're trying to  Actually do a job  Right this second  It's unbelievable  God damn E-Rock  E-Rock  This is what I tell you  You make it so easy  At times  Why at that moment  Did you have to go  To pal talk  He zoned out  Zoned out  That's good  That's what Tom  Wants to hear down the hall  That he's paying someone  A zone out  I just zoned out  It's a sadness  That a holiday  So thoroughly  And greedily enjoyed  By kids  Is being sanitized 
[01:52:30]  Out of existence  In the name of safety  Sadder still is there  Appears to be  Little reason for it  Though I've yet to find  Evidence of a genuine  Halloween poisoning  I have uncovered  A few isolated incidents  And initially report  As random poisonings  That upon further investigation  Turned out to be  Something else  Thank you for  Scrolling down E-Rock  Let's see  Let's set the criteria  For what constituted  Halloween poisoning  And then  Well do we need  To get into all this  By far  The most famous case  Of Halloween candy poisoning  Was the murder  Of 8 year old  Timothy Mark O'Brien 
[01:53:00]  At the hands of his father  Ronald Clark O'Brien  In Texas  What was this?  Child died at 10  PM  On October 31st  Of course 1974  As a result of eating  Cyanide laced  Pixie sticks  Acquired while trick or treating  To make his act  Appear more like the work  Of a random madman  O'Brien also gave  Poisoned pixie sticks  To his daughter  And three other children  By a kind stroke of fate  None of the other children  Ate the candy  What a bastard  Which proved the father  Had purchased cyanide  And had  Along with a neighbor 
[01:53:30]  Accompanied the group  Of children  On their door to door mission  None of the places  Visited that night  Were giving out pixie sticks  Young Mark's life  Was insured  For a large sum of money  And collecting on this policy  Has always been pointed to  As the motive behind  This murder  Boy he sure covered his tracks  I know  It's every single thing  To point directly at you  But this is the only  Well not the only  But one of the only cases  This guy could find  Because you hear about it  On the news every year  That kids are getting poisoned  And he had to go back to 74 
[01:54:00]  And it was proven  That it was the father  Trying to collect  On insurance money  And the father  So why does the news  Like continue to scare you  With this crap every year  It's a non-story  So it never happens  That really was a bad cover up  He buys the cyanide  And the insurance policy  On the same credit card  Right  What a dunce  And then there was another one  In Detroit in 1970  And it was another  Circumstance  Where they were trying to  Cover up something  Cover up something  If you want to read further  It's on Snopes.com  What? 
[01:54:30]  What?  Oh  Okay  Pat?  Yeah  Hey guys  Yeah  Yeah  It was told to be  The 10th call  I went to  Erock brings nothing  To the table  It was a sound effect  Of Erock  Bringing  Saying I bring nothing  To the table  You don't win  If he's actually  Bringing nothing  To the table  You guys got to  Clean that up for me  I didn't know  Oh I'm sorry  Yeah we probably  Should have made that  Alright 
[01:55:00]  Thanks a lot guys  I love our listeners  That are ball busters  I love that more than anything  So if you want to  Read up more  Read up more  On this poisoning  Of the kids  During Halloween  Go to Snopes.com  It goes on and on  But basically  The news is really  Doing a huge disservice  To parents everywhere  By scaring the crap  Out of them  With this stuff  It comes down  To just common sense  And most parents  Have that  Let them trick or treat  Like we used to  As kids  Yeah  Trying to figure out  Which house  Had the big candy bars  And which houses 
[01:55:30]  Would give you stupid pennies  And Mary Jane bars  It was like going hunting  It was right  Like find the good spot  And then you would like  You know  Mess up your costume  A little bit  To make it look like  You were a different kid  Because they were giving away  The large snicker bars  Change masks  With your friends  Change masks  Or whatever  Yeah  Or go without a mask  And they go  Well why don't you  Have a mask on  Because I was here before  Damn it  Because I was here  Five minutes ago  Dummy  It's funny  I used to hate  When you'd have  Like a little plastic mask  Like this store bought costume 
[01:56:00]  And you could smell your breath  On the inside of the mask  Oh yeah  Like after hours  Like you could  You know like  When your mouth  Would touch the little thing  When you'd talk  Your breath would stick to it  When my  When my food pocket acts up  Oh  God  That's actually like  A septic tank in your mouth  Sewer  Sewer  It's just a sewer  I will get a  I will get a whiff  On a coffee cup  Every once in a while  What's worse than  Whiffing  Whiffing your dumpster

[02:15:30]  my volume knob by the way on this just spins and spins it goes up but uh something's broken  oh wow mob trial shocker mafia debated uh ordering hit on rudy giuliani and the year  nineteen thousand eight hundred and five yeah i'm like wow that was a long time in the future  on msnbc nineteen thousand eight hundred and five cranked up all the way oh well we didn't even 
[02:16:00]  talk about that because duh they're talking about how like the mob were was uh trying to you know  trying to figure out if they should you know put a hit on rudy giuliani or not when he was pretty  much trying to shut down organized crime yeah of course they were debating if they should take him  out he was the guy he was like the prosecutor but on the news today they're like wow this is a shocker  oh what's shocking about it of course they were gonna they were thinking of taking him out they 
[02:16:30]  wanted him dead he was a busy buddy uh let's say hi to elo gotta yell at him a little bit  oh he did good elo elo elo you're killing me with all those xm mentions on the other side  i know that's why i was quiet actually tom sent me a nice email so he wasn't too angry oh he did  oh okay what did he say hey what again no he was it was we were talking about uh how soon did we  leave the party after uh somebody was done speaking so oh when uh mel was done speaking 
[02:17:00]  you all left hey hey did you get a watch at this uh party no no okay we were just wondering where  tom got the watches that he gave me and opie yeah he gave us uh nice watches today i'm like all right  i guess you didn't want the gift from the big uh dinner you guys had the other night they uh if they  gave out watch well he went and had pizza when he was done uh i actually uh abrams and i landed  at the party was still going on we actually landed here in virginia so right hey uh dude we have the  worst timing man the satellite ratings came out and we look like assholes man yeah you look like 
[02:17:30]  assholes man we really do i love it you have the timing of throat cancer we do right because  everyone's reporting on that all over the place uh local tv is up is on it let me tell you let me tell  you guys how screwed this is can i tell you a better line than i would have used to argue the timing of  diarrhea in the ninth inning oh definitely better right wow ties in with this the world series  ouch so i like that you you stick to being a corporate douche and and let eric stick to being 
[02:18:00]  funny and leave the funny to jim north i apologize i apologize jimmy no no i'm no big i love you but  for the people that weren't listening earlier um arbitron came out with their first ever ratings  for satellite radio and well let's see that's first of all where you're wrong oh all right so  there's other so well that's what they're reporting too give me the i know but this is the thing people  are so silly about this whole thing so let me i'll give you the whole first of all remember we  we used arbitron when you guys first joined the company over three years ago okay okay remember that 
[02:18:30]  earlier this year we parted ways with arbitron because we had a disagreement about how they were  surveying satellite radio so we parted ways with them because we got into a philosophical  disagreement about how they surveyed and what was going on so that's just a matter of fact  all right the second thing is this this is not a satellite radio survey that's the first thing you  guys need to understand they did not go out and field a survey to survey satellite radio what this  is is all of the markets have diaries that go into the marketplace and in these diaries those and by 
[02:19:00]  the way raise your hand on the radio anybody who has actually gotten a call from arbitron the answer  would be nobody so we won't go down that path but you get a diary in the diary there's a box  this is am and fm correct yes nowhere in the diaries is say check a box for other check a box for  internet radio or check a box for satellite radio that's the first problem okay second issue they've  been saying for many many uh quarters probably last two years that they are noticing mentions of 
[02:19:30]  satellite radio stations show up in local diaries these are people who are not necessarily subscribers  they do not grab our subscriber base and go i want to go talk to six thousand subscribers to find out  what you're listening to on xm which is what we do so this could be mary jane who's driving in a car  who just happens to have somebody has xm when they turn it on and they go oh i hear this so that's  the first thing so this is not a report they feel to disserve a satellite radio that's the most  important this important thing the second thing forget let's now let's go down this path if somebody 
[02:20:00]  in new york city in their diary listens to 10 10 wins and then writes down ob and anthony who gets  credit for that in that diary all right hold on um oh jesus this is hard i didn't know there would  be a test i would have studied no uh blink blink that's right rupaul well the point is by the way if  you went way inside there if you go you go if by their own admission if they can't identify if 
[02:20:30]  they're listening to satellite radio they give the credit to the local radio stations uh-huh all right  all right so here let me give you let me give you a better example so we know because when you when  you pay somebody money you kind of like give them credit card information you tell them everything  about it so anthony when you go by your xm satellite radio which your local provider you call and you  deactivate it correct yes because uh don wicklin is useless when it comes to that absolutely he is  awful and you say and you say they go well why did you subscribe mr mr kumia yeah well i bought it 
[02:21:00]  for baseball ob and anthony whatever else right yes all right so let's just use let me use baseball  as an example if you add up what they say the listenership for baseball is on our network okay  their their number comes out to about 344 000 people that listen to play-by-play all right  yes sir our number because people have actually told us what they subscribe to and what they 
[02:21:30]  listen to is 2.3 million right now there's a difference between those numbers then here's  the difference pretty big too there's and here's the difference 10 or 20 people driving to new york  and you write down yankees who gets the credit oh god cbs am boston no oh god not xm this is hard  by the way this is true for you guys that are on your markets it's true for us when you if you have  doc if you're listening to dr laura or you're listening why you would i don't know but if you 
[02:22:00]  are listening to dr laura or you're listening to glenn backer you're listening to sean hannity or  any of these guys on xm quiet down sean hannity that diary stop whining he gets credit oh i see  boring i know so but it seems like as far as howard stern goes they they got it right  yeah what happened there well he's not on terrestrial at all but he's but that's the  point i mean that's an i that's the point right like that's the only place he's there so if they  mention howard stern they give credit to serious no matter what no matter what because he's not on 
[02:22:30]  any other there you go and that's what hurts us you think it hurts you guys from that perspective  but it also but it hurts but the thing about this too the reason why they're not talking a lot about  it is because they don't want the other side of the argument to come out that realizes that  you know they have basically one channel for any if you look at the difference between ratings  between that channel and the rest of the network yeah yeah yeah exactly well they ask you how many  subscribers are there to xm i mean the books are pretty much open because of the justice no i mean i 
[02:23:00]  i i got there's an earnings call i have to go do here in 20 minutes but it's it's about eight  and a half million all right how many people per subscribers they they guess like they guess two  people per sub say less every every subscriber equates to about an additional person person and a  half yeah all right remember when we used to say two all right just to make ourselves feel better  it's two it's actually all right so it's about 10 million 10 million different people  no no it's closer to 16 jimmy israel okay so i'm saying it's like 87 000 and double it 
[02:23:30]  wow so almost 16 million people listen listen to me listeners to xm now by the way we also know for  a fact what the additional people so your girlfriend who listens to your xm i can tell you what i can  also tell you what she's listening to because we surveyed those people too so wait a minute so how  many people listen to opie and anthony how many people listen to opie and anthony the paper says  216 000 here's the 216 000 almost 217 000 people to listen to you in a day so the papers are wrong  okay how much just an outright wrong wait what i i missed that i'm serious he said 216 000 a day 
[02:24:00]  i can show you reports that have 216 000 people listening to you in the course of a day  a day yeah and this was weekly ratings in the paper today weekly but what those numbers are showing  average week numbers all right so the average week how many people listen to the opie and anthony show  week average week uh total number i have to i'll pull out the numbers but you're safe to assume  that just on xm alone the number is very close to a million if not north of a million i don't have  the number in front of me you look like assholes right now man no you don't so oh exactly but this 
[02:24:30]  is all well and good but no one wants to listen to this uh this babble that you just did i mean we  do and a few people out there do but the paper says stern's the heavy weight of satellite that's all  they're gonna read that's all they're gonna read and that we have nothing and that  and according to the paper today he has five times the audience we do on a weekly basis he does not  have five times the audience you do actually it would be more wouldn't it six times six times 
[02:25:00]  jesus almost six times so that's not true right that my numbers the numbers that we pay for the  numbers that i look at the numbers that we manage the network by absolutely don't support that at all  well can we slide this to david hinckley so maybe he even writes a follow-up we did try to slide it  to david hinckley and if you look at i think the hinckley article by the way we show we actually gave  him specifically i think it was printed the disparity of why we don't agree with the survey just on the  baseball example alone and the fact that we weren't even on the air oh yeah by the way that's the 
[02:25:30]  biggest point yeah but no one's gonna know that no i mean we told him that too you guys were not on the  air for six weeks during the survey yeah two week vacation and then this little uh whatever  whatever you want to call it this little little hiatus degradation butt sex we had to take i like  ass reaming i like to call it the elo panic  i don't i like to call it the in bed by 10  yeah true the early nappy have an evening out 
[02:26:00]  i love xm but that was fun if i wouldn't know we would come back i would have enjoyed that little  vacation well we can do it again i don't want to get in any trouble did you did you panic when the  first words out of the homeless guy's mouth today was kind of leads to rice well when you guys  talking about the like there's the blood on her hand i was like oh yeah what the hell you know  the homeless guy comes in the first words out of his mouth was hey kind of leads to rice like  how about you how about you not say that by the by the way uh people listen to elo very closely 
[02:26:30]  because i know now what's going to happen on the fan side so elo's just you know uh taking care of  those guys he can't he's not in position to like uh flat out lie he could get in deep shit he's a  corporate uh lackey he can't uh do things like that no offense so the paper says 216 217 let's call  217 000 a week you say it's uh close over a million here's what i can tell you right now i can tell  i'm looking at my numbers right now because i just dragged rob down here 160 north of 160 000  people a day listen to the show well that's a lot less than 200 right now just right now the 
[02:27:00]  number that arbitron published was a weekly number right okay uh we're doing our own survey right now  we have about 120 subscribers still listening to this channel because you're on the one ladies who's  still on hold now elo this is the big question and we don't hide behind this crap like other shows  how many uh how many subscribers you think howard has if you think we have over a million a week or  close to that i by the way i don't just by the way i wouldn't i would not believe i would not be 
[02:27:30]  shocked if he had a million or more it's serious i wouldn't be oh yeah i would accept that no but it's  the number him having that many listeners on serious i i don't dispute that number in fact i'd actually  argue that it may actually be a little bit lower than that so you're wow so i mean actually a little  bit higher than that i'm sorry i mean i think i think the arbitron number is probably understated  so we're relatively close to his numbers yeah no i think you are relatively close but why aren't we  making 100 million a year well now that's a different issue i know we'd have to split it like uh you know 
[02:28:00]  you guys split it five ways well we'd have to split it let's say uh um do it all under the table man  come on just slip us a few bucks just like the old bar days anthony where we get the cash from doing  the intro of a car dealership that's it man those were the good old days good old days we're in  trouble so can we like uh send this to you know david hinkley how about this though does mel know the  real numbers uh no he does not know the real numbers because they well he's gonna read this 
[02:28:30]  today we know how this works this is on his desk today no but see it is on his desk but the other  thing is is that he actually looks at his own real numbers which probably show it bigger than what it  is oh this stinks here's what's gonna happen they're gonna merge all right here's here we're  not gonna be involved in any of the packages here's your number jimmy relax all right here's  your number you ready i got rob here remember bald rob well who's rob by the way because i'm sending  this audio to david hinkley okay rob okay when you guys accurately portrayed what happened when rob 
[02:29:00]  and i came up there the research guy and we showed you how big it was and we were all having that  lovely cheeseburger at the park in meridian yeah blackberry went off yes remember that rob yeah  okay so he's sitting in front of me now and i'm looking at the most recent data that i've got  that shows xm alone when you use the total listing universe that we just talked about okay you have  a weekly cum audience of 1.5 million we have 1.5 million people listening to this crap every week 
[02:29:30]  yeah is that including terrestrial no no see that should have that should have been what it said  in the paper today it should have said 1.5 million  here's why i believed your obviously because i wanted to believe it but i also i i went to it  so i got an email from somebody who sent me that figure i said i remember the day that the condoleez  rice thing happened you you guys were up and what you were saying was consistent with what you had said  say six months before but it was a little more advanced and it was like all the pages of boring 
[02:30:00]  pie charts it was like a fucking honestly though it really was a 30 page shitty powerpoint  presentation but you broke it down by like three to six on the west coast three to six you had it  broken down in every possible way time spent listening uh uh this time ron and fez the entire  channel so that was why i kind of believed your uh analysis more is that you guys went to subscribers i 
[02:30:30]  didn't realize they didn't go to subscribers i'm babbling by the way arbitron does not talk to  subscribers yeah but like you said it uh howard's number is relatively accurate might be a little  i think i think the real i think the howard numbers are probably smaller i mean your question to me was  bigger do i think it's bigger yeah the number that arbitron published is smaller you asked me if i  believe that number sure i think howard's probably got north of a million subs i don't doubt i don't i  don't doubt that at all do you think he has more listeners than us i think when you factor your  terrestrial radio well no i don't want to do that part just satellite i mean does he have more on 
[02:31:00]  satellite radio i wouldn't be surprised if he did but there's no way for me to know but it's pretty  damn close it's it by the way it's not it's here's what i will tell you the difference in audience that  howard has on satellite alone is not five times bigger than you that much i can promise you and uh  and prove my point right we're a much better deal for xm than he was for serious come on you get you  guys are a fantastic deal yeah that's not right revenue you're you're uh you're great employees  that wasn't good that was the worst point proving i've ever heard elo is a great spinner and that was 
[02:31:30]  the most horrible attempt at a point proving moment you guys are you're never late  that's our boss he's got a sound machine  all right elo we're finished i know unless i mean you i mean finish i know i know offline we'll talk  a lot more about it in the tester i'm by the way there was some some guy who had like quotes for me  he's like i'm getting emails from the pest calling me a liar and why why my ratings i was just like 
[02:32:00]  would you guys just leave me alone yeah okay uh pests leave them alone well no they've been  discussing this all night long by the way i've got it was the overnight discussion on whack bag  no they called me that someone's put my office number up they've all called me because i'd like  to talk to elo about the ratings i mean there's like there's like a pest there's like a pest  conference call they want me to get on well we got this guy nick uh from new york nick go ahead 
[02:32:30]  yeah listen you you can't say in one breath that the arbitron don't count and then in the next  brett say well we were off for six weeks so they really get a good vote you got i mean i love this  show but you start talking like that people are going to pick up on it what do you mean do we're  being what are you talking about that we're actually you're saying you're saying in one breath that the  arbitron ratings don't matter right you're saying we have our own count that you know it's not a true  it's not a true meaning of what you uh what's going on out there then you turn around and say well  we also missed six weeks we weren't on for six weeks during the rating season you can't say both those 
[02:33:00]  things because somebody's going to say hey you want that cake and eat it too  hey silly ghost listen to me it's the same point i'm first of all i'm just i'm making the point that  we don't believe them anyway i'm just saying first of all they're completely understated to begin with  and second of all they weren't even on for six weeks so if you wanted to add credibility to it  why don't you survey them when they're actually on the air but that way that's fine but it sounded  like you were making an excuse of why it was well no sir just wanted to do it to a caller i know 
[02:33:30]  what you're saying sir but elo really was making the same point he was just adding to it like that  he was further proving how ridiculous it is by saying that the survey was done when they  weren't even on the air it's just i know you're saying but he's not trying to make two points  like that are different he's kind of just adding to the same point all right yeah no all right that  works all right nick no i like that nick called and uh was able to straighten out i just want nick and  i to straighten things out nick and i sit down we talk nick can i take you off my call sheet so i  have to call you back yeah sure okay thank you nick all right nick from new york hello all right 
[02:34:00]  elo thanks for uh lunch the other day it was nice hey you're welcome anytime it was good seeing  you it was great to see you too no it was hilarious by the way uh there was about 10 of us eating lunch  and the only person that didn't get their lunch was elo elo didn't get his lunch why it was hilarious  they forget the vodka where's my lunch there's the bottle and then get it see when one joke doesn't  work he just rephrases and bomb twice and then everyone was talking about how elo just quotes 
[02:34:30]  the show during like really big meetings you know you the only reason we're on xm satellite radio today  is because of eric logan oh i don't know there's a lot of people who love you here that's not true  no no no but i mean you saved us when we were in our recent trouble i firmly believe you i'm not  saying nate doesn't like us or anybody else but i'm saying he doesn't like me but he likes those guys  you saved us eric elo's kept me relatively sane in the last three years so but uh yeah logan uses a  lot of opie and anthony stuff during huge corporate meetings oh oh you when he's going to get his his 
[02:35:00]  lunch the other day uh she says something like oh yours isn't out yet and he goes why would it be  well then opa you got to tell what you got to tell the story about the comment card yeah that's  another thing oh that was i can't believe you went with that by the way it it brought me such joy  they didn't bring his salad i so i whispered elo i'm like when she comes back because i you know  she's like i'm sorry it'll only take a minute i'll put it in it'll be out here in a minute and 
[02:35:30]  he goes no that's okay i'll just get a hot dog that's the worst thing you could say to a waitress  i think in a kind of nice restaurant it's like don't worry that you forgot about me i'll just  get a hot dog from the street vendor yeah so then it went back and forth i'm really sorry it'll just  take a minute how about fries i can get you a little side dish what anything and then i think you  finally said i'll have another iced tea or whatever you were drinking and then i whispered to elo after  she left i go ask for a comment card when she comes back yeah comment card and she just she turned 
[02:36:00]  white yeah she did because she comes back and she was so sorry and was like you know trying to do  anything she can you know she because it really wasn't her fault and elo with a straight face goes  yeah uh can i have a comment card and then she goes oh no you're not gonna oh god no you're not  gonna give me a bad review anthony couldn't rat me out anthony was trying to hide under the table oh  it was so embarrassing i guess you had to be there elo hung up on us wow yeah that doesn't happen 
[02:36:30]  very often he lost weight too eric he looks very good 20 he has really weird timing like he wanted  to do that gag but then it was i don't know he's just a little off he doesn't mean he's just a little  off good egg he means well he does mean well we like him he does well i'm sure that straightened out  the whole uh ratings thing and i'm sure every paper and uh media outlet will pick up on it and report it  accordingly yes you know what whatever it'll help a little bit i just hope that arbitron wasn't taking 
[02:37:00]  ratings for the last uh 20 minutes because we'd be in deep trouble oh uh arbitron can fucking eat  my ball bag it's fucking fixed i know the guy his name is pete arbitron he's a fucking liar  let's say hi to mike in jersey mikey pete arbitron ted arbitron is a shit dick and pete arbitron is a liar  sorry no we should have done there we're not thinking we should have had uh david hinkley on the  other line on the other line there's notepad and pen just jotting as elo was jotting down just 
[02:37:30]  jotting and scribbling giving cold hard facts it's true why didn't we think of that or someone else  because we're stupid uh mike in jersey what's up what's up guys you guys uh look at the deli news  today yeah um eight uh stalker paddy's in there yeah stalker paddy's in there we forgot to do this  earlier she's commenting uh pressure just keeps getting worse poll indicates uh ticking stress 
[02:38:00]  bombs longer hours at work and low pay it's enough to give anyone a migraine and then they got all  sorts of uh facts here americans are wired among all americans uh work is most stressful for east  coasters oh he's listening to himself that thanks for setting us up oh you ass we'll take it from  here 77 of americans suffer physically from stress 48 lie awake at night losing an average of 21 hours  of sleep per month 44 get headaches 36 uh percent feel like they could cry 34 get upset stomach upset 
[02:38:30]  stomachs 30 suffer muscle tension you get the idea then they uh decided they needed to take this  survey to the street and then and talk to the man on the street and there's a ghoul on the street  well why don't we read a few of the other ones first you had uh patricia davies 38 a restaurant  worker from roosevelt long island her quote is nothing i'm nothing i'm good to go when you just laugh  and laugh the stress level goes way down i don't let anything get to me uh so the question i guess was 
[02:39:00]  what gives you ad agita uh robert daly 43 an engineer from baldwin long island stupid people give me  agita for one like those people who don't get out of the way when i'm trying to get on the train  then you got masio resar 53 a paralegal from harlem children children's education children's safety  that's a very big issue i have eight grown-up kids now it's my grandkids i have to worry about this  that's what gives him agita then you got carl 49 a contractor from southampton uh what gives him 
[02:39:30]  agita the federal government's monetary policy that's what causes all the stress you have investments  that are your life your work your business it all comes down to the bottom line we finally get  to stalker patty patty brooks 52 would you like to read that one jimmy oh i don't have the paper  i don't have it in front of you i'll be happy to though all right page eight let me get that page  eight here in the old dn page eight in your work book let's remember here yeah the other people  were talking about uh their kids give them stress uh people get not getting out of their way 
[02:40:00]  finances finances these are all basic things that give us stress then you get stalker patty go ahead  uh it's she's listed as a starbucks barista from what gives me agita when i see a lot more police  presence in times square where i live it gets a little stressful but you just got to live  your life your life why would that get you stressful and i were laughing i'm like isn't 
[02:40:30]  that the only time in your life you feel really good like i walk around with like money just pour  like well peeking out of my pockets when i see police around i feel yeah i feel so safe when i see  police presence she didn't finish though what gives me the agita they didn't they didn't print her  whole quote it's she sees all the police in midtown and those cock bulges that she's so confused by  they give her a tingling in her fucking sewn up snatch and she kind of wants to know the throes of 
[02:41:00]  passion from a police officer yet the baton also looks attractive where did i run out of steam on  that one boy did i all right let's go to stalker patty sorry patty patty hi patty hi they didn't  exactly quote me it was it was context because they talked about stress levels they didn't say  anything about agita right agita oh i i would have said like put good like uh eggplant parmesan  hey patty can you shut the fuck up for a second and have what's called a conversation with a human 
[02:41:30]  being she's incapable anthony's in the middle of doing a great impression of you and beating you up  and you have to like fuck it all up she fucked it all up all right go ahead patty go ahead patty  well wait wait wait not yet that i felt good seeing the police presence right they're probably  rehearsing in case there's a problem but as far as rehearsing everybody has and that was it well patty 
[02:42:00]  what do you mean by uh the police rehearsing well i always see about 10 or 20 cop cars going in a row  i see them parking diagonally up 42nd street i see a bunch of wagons go by and stuff and i really  think they're rehearsing in case there really is a problem because there's never any problem when  they're doing that you know well do you think patty do you think that basically though it's just a 
[02:42:30]  rehearsing for a real problem well i don't know i really don't fully understand why it's there but  it's there but you know it makes you actually feel safer do you think do you think basically  oh i knew this was gonna be a disaster when they came to me  so so what gives you agita uh bad food actually 
[02:43:00]  you're a barista what are what do they call you baristas  that sounds like a mexican rapist the baristas it got her they found her lip was bloody and there  a coffee grinds in her pussy i'm sorry patty i didn't mean to try to do a joke like sexy up a  coffee pours job yeah what the fuck is a barista maybe maybe in paris it means something i don't  know but not in stupid new york city you know they said i said everybody gets stressed from everything 
[02:43:30]  you know you just live your life and that's it and that's basically what i told them they must have  taken a bunch of things that you know and just like printed and then made up whatever they wanted  yeah not made up there you so you're saying that the paper lied see i don't know how to talk and  soundbite you know what no idea how to do that you know what though patty you uh made the paper i'm 
[02:44:00]  sure they talked to more than four people well probably you were the only aunt they quoted  all i know is i'm so embarrassed i'm not used to that kind of attention well i think you did well  pat that's a pretty good answer i mean you're saying that the police presence makes you a little  nervous because if the cops are up and about and they're rehearsing there might be a real problem  yeah yeah but you don't worry about it don't need to contradict me and humiliate me i'm just trying  to side with you hey patty is your phone ringing off the hook because of all this attention you're 
[02:44:30]  getting yeah i bet oh no you're the only one who called me i didn't even expect to make the paper  you know they interviewed dozens of people and only pick a couple but i was just standing there  minding my business and they came over to me how does one mind their own business i i want to i want  to get into that a little bit you hear that from time to time yeah i was just minding my own business  standing there minding my own business as opposed to what just tapping people on cell phones going who  are you talking to what are you talking about quickly quickly i'm minding your business that's 
[02:45:00]  right how do you mind your own business uh patty i just keep the mind donna wants to know you know  into other people's uh personal problems and stuff unless they share it with me i just uh you know go  about my way and that's it yeah i never ask questions or anything you mind your own p's and q's  yeah basically if it's an a and b conversation you see your way out of it oh i like that 
[02:45:30]  that's a good one yeah is it well good i'm glad you approve thank you patty  yeah all right uh damn all right oh uh gabe from staten ireland elo shitty haircut has more  personality than stalker patty oh i have a personality oh yeah bad one  are you working right now no i'm off i'm home i'm on pal talk actually oh okay she's the one  she's like a window i would never even pop up on pal talk i'd rather have a fucking three fat arab

[03:00:30]  i want to i should ask more did he get a new person doing these segments it seems like it's  a different vibe on his show lately it's been really fucking every show has been interesting  you know what for a while they were just doing a lot of those paternity shows that was like really big  and uh i guess he's kind of getting off of that subject uh and getting some new subject matter in  there it's pretty pretty cool yeah maury's great you know why you just know and nothing against maury 
[03:01:00]  we love the guy love his show but he's not one of these phonies that sit there and really like  care and it's it's it's a side show it's like a freak show kind of a thing yeah he's doing the pt  barm thing if you want to see a primordial dwarf in a cheerleader uniform go you're gonna watch maury's  show i gotta see that i know we had jerry on uh recently i don't watch jerry as much as maury  maury is uh is the shit yeah i don't like jimmy said something happened uh it seems within his 
[03:01:30]  organization yeah maybe i should take a cue from him  yes maybe we should uh maybe we can maybe that's just a corny joke all right why don't we uh play  some of this they throw you ever see that with the cheerleaders in the competitions when they throw  the one up in the air real high yeah imagine how high you could get a fucking primordial dwarf  you could actually toss her to the other cheerleaders for the other team across the field she'd be  falling like that guy out of the fucking weather balloon we saw that footage yeah we'll take a 
[03:02:00]  break while we wait for this little fucker to come back down to earth then meanwhile a  fucking crow scooped her up in midair i thought she was just a stupid big-eyed bird big rabbit or  something exactly why would a bird grab a bird oh it could happen and it couldn't and who would go  with the excuse that it's a milk stain yeah it's a milk stain mayo grease yeah  didn't he say walk by multiple migses fucking place i threw a load at me what am i gonna do babe 
[03:02:30]  all right listen uh maury megan is afraid of balloons you want to do this a little bit or what  yeah let's let's hear a little of this now my next guest megan has a life-altering  most people you know we use to celebrate my faltering things that always seem to put a  smile on every kid's balloons megan is scared of balloons she has missed birthday parties she's  even forbidden her own daughter her five-year-old daughter from playing with balloons 
[03:03:00]  because balloons are terrorizing her life why the why the beeps  was that a bit it sounds like it doesn't it sound like is she like oh  shit and all that as as maury's explaining it's not me i mean obviously it's not me  why are you beeping it though i'm not beeping why are you beeping it though the guy was a little  accident leave alone and my knee hurts now so i have a conclusion are you now working for the man  no i would never work for him he's an asshole the man stinks thank you that's possible that's 
[03:03:30]  nothing special anywho uh i don't know the amount of bleeps in this episode of maury is probably  it's probably some kind of record like if i take all the bleeping that they did in this episode of  maury and put it all together it would probably equate to like 10 full minutes of yeah but we're  not playing this on the free fm side we're playing it here though  well i guess you're gonna have to ask one of maury's producers about that because i have no idea  what they're bleeping there must have just been people going like oh  shit oh fuck oh you would think he would tell like maybe he does tell his guessing audience you 
[03:04:00]  got to keep the cursing down so he gets i don't know yeah i don't know who i don't know if it's  to stop fucking cursing you cunt no you know what i want to hear you know what it is is there was a  i know what happened actually there's a couple i know that went to that taping yeah and their names  are shit dick and twat nose and that's their real name so they talk to each other a lot swinging a miss  god could i have what were the what were the names again  shit dick and twat nose oh i was hoping you just didn't hear it 
[03:04:30]  oh my god so fucking asshole and cunt ears  we're fucking chitting and chatting about their kids you're fucking you blooped one out yeah their  kids aids and taint stink why don't they believe that ain't back now  you're weaving i really am let's find out why she's scared of balloons here more from megan from 
[03:05:00]  maury i am definitely afraid of balloons are you when i see them i run away when i hear balloons being  blown up when they pop it freaked me out it makes me choke almost when i was growing up my three  brothers used to chase me with balloons and run their fingers down it would make the most awful  sound and they thought it was funny cream-filled balloons freaked me out i can't even take my  daughter to pizza parties because i know that there are going to be balloons there and i feel 
[03:05:30]  suffocated i don't know why i'm so afraid of them i want to get help i don't want to feel this way  anymore  this shit can't be real that's a weird balloons are weird they're also sexual fetish oh really yeah  there are guys that get off on women blowing up balloons and sitting on them so these that has 
[03:06:00]  like maybe she's maybe she's maybe she's scared no no dead serious maybe maury's trick is like uh  maybe this megan is really scared of black people and maury goes to her head of time goes like we  can't say black people on tv anymore so just say balloons yes balloon animals say your friends  a balloon lover because it just doesn't seem real man i think he's doing a little substitution here  you want to replace um balloon with black person that is that what you're saying what is that that 
[03:06:30]  what you were saying that perhaps they replaced the word balloon with yeah yeah because i wanted to  like but without doing it obviously but listen to her again and just in your mind replace the word  and see what happens can we bleep out every mention of balloon and then then this is going to be a track  full of bleeps i think oh really yeah all right just make believe uh maury theater of the mind i don't know  know if this is going to work but we'll give it a shot what the hell uh make believe maury told her  ahead of time look i know you're scared of black people but we can't say black people you know the 
[03:07:00]  imus thing so can you just just say balloon say balloon or balloon animal okay go ahead let's see if  this works i don't know i am definitely afraid of balloons when i see them i run away when i hear balloons  i mean you know what maybe it will work all right i'm with you fuck the bleeps  gotta use your own creativity in your own little noggin all right so now she's talking about black  people but maury told her honey you're gonna have to say balloons so we don't get in trouble we 
[03:07:30]  understand you mean black people but just say balloons and when we say uh black people we mean uh  balloons balloons i am definitely afraid of balloons when i see them i run away when i hear  balloons being blown up when they pop it freaks me out it makes me choke almost when i was growing up 
[03:08:00]  my three brothers used to chase me with balloons and run their fingers down the balloon  it would make the most awful sound and they thought it was funny it freaks me out i can't even take  my daughter to pizza parties because i know that there are going to be balloons there  i feel suffocated i don't know why i'm so afraid of them i don't want to get help i don't want to 
[03:08:30]  feel this way anymore all right that works certainly does yes well maury shows her blanks on tv and  plays sounds of blanks rubbing this is what maury does to try to cure her of her phobia your five-year-old 
[03:09:00]  daughter loves balloons oh shit oh boy that ain't good okay we have her back for a future show  future show about fathers that shoot themselves  oh she's perfect for our paternity testing  is it true you were robbed by a balloon all right here we go your five-year-old daughter 
[03:09:30]  loves balloons she loves balloons and she i can't even take her and have her enjoy a party because  i'm afraid because i'm afraid because i can't remember a time where i could go and enjoy myself  at a party or or be somewhere guys who make these out of balloons it's the sound you couldn't stand  right i can't stand them how about when you blow them up i can't do it i can't i can't be around 
[03:10:00]  people that are doing it i can't put air i can't put air in my tires i have to go and i can't put air in  your tires  that's the video screen with balloons popping because it's not like gum popping you know  enough i think it has something to do with growing up around violence 
[03:10:30]  oh hold on because i think it's the impending pop and hold on my my mic's kind of cutting out  i need to balloon rig it hold on all right that's better yeah  fucking i'm just dude i'm so fucking tired you understand there must have been a party going  next to my fucking apartment really really fucking just i could hear balloons all night  i think it has something to do with the fear of violence because the yeah you're blowing it up 
[03:11:00]  it's like the impending yeah the the popping of a balloon is always very like yeah a lot of anxiety  as a kid when you had a balloon because it was so fragile that popping noise yeah i think that that's  what it's either about that or it's about love lost hey um yeah yeah are you uh into analyzing of uh  dreams uh depends i've had a few myself but why do you have one my lovely uh my lovely uh 
[03:11:30]  she's into that a little bit her mom's into that a little bit so i'm very good at it actually  so every once in a while i uh will bring a a dream to her attention yeah and i think i finally stumped  her i had a dream cut her leg off that i took oh stop massive easy flowing  shit into what looked sort of like a cross between a bucket and a toilet bowl and filled it right up to 
[03:12:00]  the tippy top the tippity tippy top the tippity top and there was still more shit that needed to come  out so i had to get a smaller toilet slash bucket apparatus and continued my shit fest it's pretty  obvious yeah yeah you have all this inner turmoil and maybe pain shit that has to come out oh and  there's not enough room for it you know you're afraid it's going to overflow and you won't know

[03:27:30]  it didn't work but doesn't  when never seen candy mongoloids when she talks about where it came from  candy is smarter  and less embarrassing to hold up in a photo  so you can't none of us a pez dispenser facing the wrong way i've seen m&ms displayed in their  upside down hair  you know how many chickens american americans eat every day not me 
[03:28:00]  amen what is it about chicken because when i was younger i was walking down the street we lived in  this little town and everybody had chickens and the chicken got out of the yard and he chasing down the  the street  keep walking faster and faster i couldn't get away from it  it that's what makes sense  you have nightmares don't you what's your nightmare  there's a big giant chicken

[03:31:00]  What the F is going on?  I wish we'd have heard this before we talked to Maury.  It's distracting the hell out of us as far as our bit goes.  They're too long to be anything.  His audience is probably cursive.  No, I don't think it is.  Because the last time he did the phobia show, they didn't really have many beeps, if any.  If there was a problem like that ever, they would tell the audience, look, we're fucking taping here.  Shut the fuck up.  Or we're kicking you out.  I mean, and it can't be the woman with the phobia because she's in like mid-screen.  Yeah, she's crying or screaming. 
[03:31:30]  It can't be Maury.  Maury, foul-mouthed Maury.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Chicago.  Jeff.  Yeah, it's me.  Yeah, I know.  What's up?  What's going on?  Am I on the air?  Yeah.  Yes, you are, sweetie.  I just want to let you know that I think your station is awful.  And you guys have absolutely nothing to say that's funny other than it's proud of the fact that you guys are able to swear on the air.  You raise a good point.  Okay.  Interesting.  Why are you listening?  Let's see. 
[03:32:00]  You think you got us.  Why do you care what I'm doing there?  I'm calling in to talk about your show.  That's what I'm doing.  But why don't you just try something else then?  Problem with that there.  Well, I'm calling to give you my two cents.  You got a problem with that?  Frunkus.  Why don't you swear at me?  Because you could swear now, can't you?  Swear now?  You've been swearing for three years, sir.  Swear.  Where's the frunkus?  Yeah, give us a good frunkus.  You guys are the biggest.  You guys get paid? 
[03:32:30]  No.  No, we volunteer.  This is volunteer work, you douche.  Listen to him.  He wants to hear himself on the radio.  We're on the radio, douchebag.  You got to turn it on to hear yourself.  Oh, what a loser.  What a loser.  Turn it up.  Maybe I'll hear my voice.  It must be nice to hear your voice on the radio.  That's it, exactly.  You're really funny, man.  What a douchebag.  Let me hear. 
[03:33:00]  I think I said something funny.  Let me call my buddies and tell them I was on.  I hung up, you faggot.  You fucking faggot.  Call back, you fag.  Yesterday you were saying that.  Go suck balloon cock.  But you were saying yesterday that you don't want to be bothered by this type of thing anymore  because it's too stressful.  Yeah, I'm not bothered, really.  That was just kind of fun.  That was kind of just fun.  Hope is fucking, hope is, he comes home and finds his girlfriend playing with like four  balloons and fucking gum in her hair and a fucking, and then oh, nine months later, she's fucking 
[03:33:30]  holding a chicken.  The fucking trifecta.  I was trying to figure out how you're going to work in chunks and they're like, wait for  it.  Got to be careful that the balloons don't eat the mongoloid.  Oh, shit.  Why don't we do Amber Lee and get the hell out of here or out of this bit. 
[03:34:00]  She's afraid of crabs.  Suggestions are coming in, replace crabs with cocks, gays.  I have a funny one, I have a funny one.  Oh, yes, yes.  Potato salad.  Potato salad it is.  Uh, crabs.  It would have to be something sexual.  Either, yes, a penis.  Or perhaps just crabs. 
[03:34:30]  How about we go with uncut penises?  Uncut dick.  Okay.  But she's only afraid of the extra skin on the tip.  She's not afraid of the cock.  Only the guy who's real foreskinny.  The foreskin.  She's afraid of foreskin.  Uncut cock.  All right.  From the tip out.  Very good.  Foreskin.  Like, yeah.  All right?  Yeah.  So Amber Lee is afraid of uncut cock.  Just the foreskin. 
[03:35:00]  Now, this is Amber Lee.  Now, Amber Lee has a big, big problem.  The only way she can get rid of her phobia, she'd have to move.  You see, she lives in Florida.  She can't stand crabs.  What are you doing in Florida?  If you can't stand crabs.  Jews.  I can't get away from Florida.  I'm in school there.  I've got a job.  I've got...  I can't just move.  Okay.  Crabs or Jews?  Let's switch it around.  We're sorry about the whole uncut penis thing. 
[03:35:30]  Crabs have to equal Jews now.  Yeah.  I kind of like my uncut cock.  Yeah, but it's the location.  I don't have an uncut cock.  Fuck you.  Are you unclipped?  Fuck you.  Are you unclipped?  That's a good clip to keep.  You really think I'm unclipped?  Are you insane?  You might be.  I just like the idea that I came up with, which was uncut cock.  You came up with the uncut cock?  That's right.  Wow.  That's right.  Leave it alone. 
[03:36:00]  I'm a messiah.  Of course it's cut.  You clipped?  Yeah.  Tightly.  Got a nice crown on it to you?  Tightly.  I was tailored.  I think I was tailored.  I left a little room to grow in, so I have like fucking elbows of skin on the side.  Your cock looks like Superman.  Yeah, it does.  Elbows of skin.  My cock is standing akimbo with its arms akimbo.  And I store things in there because it's not going to grow anymore. 
[03:36:30]  That looks like Lucas's neck.  It's all ready to grow and be plump.  All right.  We got to go with Jew.  Mine is cut so tight that every time I get a hard on, my fucking asshole sucks in.  I was cut.  They didn't leave me any breathing room at all.  The skin is so tight.  You know I get a hard on because my toes scrape down against the floor.  He's enjoying that. 
[03:37:00]  All right.  Here we go.  We go with the Jew.  Yeah.  Now, this is Amber Lee.  Now, Amber Lee has a big, big problem.  The only way she can get rid of her phobia, she'd have to move.  You see, she lives in Florida.  Florida, she can't stand crap.  What are you doing in Florida if you can't stand crap?  I can't move away from Florida.  I'm in school there.  I've got a job.  I've got...  I can't just move away from Florida. 
[03:37:30]  Look.  Now, look.  Now, see that picture.  I don't want to...  I don't...  I'm not looking.  You're not looking?  No.  Okay.  You kicked your friend's mother in the face.  Wow.  Hope it wasn't on the Sabbath.  Because you were running away from a crab.  It was like this big, wasn't it?  It was smaller than...  Sometimes you think rocks are crabs.  If I think that a rock in the ocean is a crab, I can't go back in the water. 
[03:38:00]  Even if it is just a rock, even if it's not a crab, I'll go back in the water.  Oh, my God.  I think that kind of works.  It works.  Bravo.  She's going to explain why she's afraid of Jews in this clip.  Crabs are so ugly.  I hate the way they look.  I hate the way they look.  Holy...  That's really vicious of you.  Oh, my God.  This anti-Semite.  Oh, my God.  Oh, this is horrible.  The Alicent is anti-Semite. 
[03:38:30]  It's half as...  Call the authorities.  You should not talk about the Jewish people in that fashion.  This is awful.  Crabs are so ugly.  I hate the way they look.  I hate the way they walk.  I hate their eyes, their claws.  I hate the way they walk.  I hate the way they walk.  I hate the way they walk.  I hate the way they walk.  I hate the way they walk.  It's a Borat line.  The Jew.  The Jew.  The Jew.  To defend against the claws.  Of the Jew. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, their claws.  Oh, Jesus.  What a great game.  This is bad.  Crabs are so ugly.  I hate the way they look.  I hate the way they walk.  I hate their eyes, their claws.  I see a crab.  I get real shaky.  And my hands start sweating.  And I start crying.  There was a crab mating season not too long ago.  I live in Florida.  They're everywhere.  I live in Florida.  They're everywhere.  I wish I could avoid them because it would make my life so much easier. 
[03:39:30]  I feel like crabs know that I'm there and they know that I'm scared of them.  And so they're trying to get me.  They're chasing me.  They're feeding off this fear that I have.  All of my friends like to go swimming way out in the ocean near rocks.  And I can't go with them because I'm afraid I'll see a crab. 
[03:40:00]  And so I always get left behind on the beach.  And I don't even like to eat at restaurants that serve crab legs because I don't even like  to be near a dead crab.  It's thinking about everything that I'm missing because of my fear.  They're haunting me in my dreams.  I can't get away from them.  Wow.  For the most part, that's right on.  That really is spot on as far as if you want to go with some anti-Semitism and that  woman's little rant. 
[03:40:30]  All right.  Here we go.  Maury scares her with a Jew.  Is it the claws?  What is it?  Everything is the way they crawl is their claws, their eyes, everything about them.  You don't want to, but you've got to.  This is the first, you know, the first leg in the process.  Okay, bring out the crab.  No, don't.  Please don't.  No.  I've got it.  No.  No.  You don't want to go that way.  His publisher walks out.  You know?  No. 
[03:41:00]  What?  Hello.  You're all right?  Okay.  It's going to be all right.  It's going to be all right.  It's going to be all right.  It's going to be all right.  All right.  Don't worry about it.  It's going to be fine.  It's going to be fine.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Did you see it?  Yes.  Okay.  Well, we'll take it away now.  Okay.  You see it right here, and now we'll take it away. 
[03:41:30]  Amber, take a look at it.  Oh, me, please.  All right.  No, no, no.  Don't.  No, no, no.  Don't.  Don't get any closer.  Come here.  Come here.  It's over.  It's over.  It's over.  It's over.  Well.  That is funny, man.  That's funny.  Oh, wow.  That was brutal.  That was brutal.  Their eyes, their claws.  I live in Florida. 
[03:42:00]  They're everywhere.  But can you imagine how funny it would be if she said, every time I go to the bank, there's  just a bunch of crabs.  That would have been perfect.  Or I can't even get news because the crabs are running the media down here.  We got to do that bit with the local news or something.  We can't let that one die.  Yeah.  It's too fucking good, man.  Yeah.  Fucking good.  I'm fucking tired, man.  Yeah, a little bit.  I lose my wind between 10th and 11th.  We can do a line of the day. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  It's brought to you by Destination Sources, currently inactive, sorry, monitor of presets.  All right.  Oh, there we go.  I'm not sure.  Sorry.  I'm like a news guy with the teleprompter.  You know how tired I am?  That I'm going to doze off when I get home with a log, like a piece of shit, half hanging  out of my ass.  Like I would sit in the toilet.  I'll be shitting.  I'll be so tired.  I'll just walk into bed and fall asleep on my side with the lawn sticking halfway out  and I'll finish it later. 
[03:43:00]  That's why I want to get a puppy.  So when that happens, he can come up and just chew it out while I'm sleeping.  Fucking.  I don't know if a puppy would do that.  Sure he would.  He'd just.  Yeah.  He'd gobble it down and swab out my cheeks and I wouldn't have to move.  Swab.  Lee Abrams just sent me an email.  Yeah.  That's all I should say is 500 Z's from Lee.  Who can I send this to?  He's got control tower tape of the midair collision at the Republic airport. 
[03:43:30]  When did it happen?  What does he have?  Remember we were talking about.  Yeah.  The collision.  Republic.  He's got control tower tape.  Oh.  And he says it gets a real interesting a minute in.  Well, the guys lived, so it's got to be like really creepy that they're probably panicky.  Anybody.  I think it's sent it to me or you or Dan.  Anybody?  Yeah.  Danny.  Send it to Maury.  Danny.  I hope this isn't my cousin Danny. 
[03:44:00]  Danny.  I'm going to make sure.  Hello.  Right?  Oh, no, no, no.  Don't give that one.  Give Danny at foundrymusic.com.  Oh.  All right.  I'm going to send it to Than then because I don't have that in my system.  My system, Than.  Okay.  Wait.  Get the Gmail one.  It's fine.  I don't have you either.  Oh, son of a.  And at foundrymusic.com. 
[03:44:30]  Why would I?  All right.  I love this.  Just send it to anyone.  There's all kinds of it.  Send it to anyone.  No, no, no.  Don't even mention that one.  Send it to our personal email.  No, no, not that one either.  That's for.  All right.  I'll send it to you.  Okay.  Maybe we can get this on before the end of the show.  Okay.  My computer just craps at the line.  All I have to do is get it just to file.  Maybe just the easiest way.  We don't have to edit.  I just want to hear the.  A minute in.  He says it's pretty good.  Okay.  What are we doing?  Bodogfantasy.net?  Yeah.  All right.
