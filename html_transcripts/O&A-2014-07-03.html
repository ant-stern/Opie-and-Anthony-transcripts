<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the attire of past broadcasters, contrasting William B. Williams with modern standards, seguing into sexually suggestive comments about Irene Cara's appearance in *Fame*, punctuated by on-air difficulties playing her music.  Dennis Falcone, a Sirius XM personality, was a guest and given a send-off, with further suggestive comments about Irene Cara.  Several commercials aired, and the show then covered the Carnival cruise ship incident, focusing on passengers’ reactions and graphic descriptions of the ship’s unsanitary conditions.  Gabriel Iglesias promoted his comedy special.  This was followed by a lengthy interview with Bert Kreischer, who recounted numerous anecdotes about his early career struggles and successes, including defecating in a pizza box to gain attention, getting a Rolling Stone article, and landing a morning show in Tallahassee.  He detailed high-stakes stunts like skydiving with Rachel Ray and a harrowing sky jump in Vegas, mentioning his anxiety and producer pressure.  Kreischer also recounted stories of partying with Russian mobsters, robbing a train in Russia, and his appearance on *The Late Show with David Letterman*. He described his work for the Travel Channel and his "media nightmare" reputation.  Kreischer's segment concluded with the arrival of Adrian, a topless basketball player from Dennis Rodman's team, who brought a birthday cake for Norton.  The hosts engaged in sexually explicit conversation with Adrian, creating an increasingly uncomfortable situation that culminated in a staff member, Laney, being hit by a door.

The show then shifted to a discussion about an incident involving Kenny and Laney, featuring crude humor and sexually explicit language.  Dice, a frequent guest, recounted the events, detailing clothes being cut with scissors and a jacuzzi incident.  The hosts and Dice debated the "winners" and "losers," using vulgar terms to describe the women involved.  The conversation devolved into Dice's marital life and racist and sexist comments about women, aided by online visual aids.  Several commercial breaks interspersed this segment, advertising fitness franchises among other products.

Next, a rambling discussion ensued about the physical attributes of female celebrities (Beyoncé, Alicia Keys, Michelle Obama), punctuated by crude language.  A caller shared a story about high school with the *Clueless* actress.  Another caller recounted a documentary about his WWII veteran father, detailing humorous and disturbing anecdotes.  More commercials interrupted, promoting credit repair, trucking companies, joint supplements, e-cigarettes, and real estate services.  Listener calls about finding biological parents followed, with varying outcomes, concluding with further discussion about adoption.

A segment focused on the hosts' adoption experiences, quickly veering into offensive tangents regarding racial stereotypes in adoption and racially charged humor about different racial groups at comedy shows.  This was followed by anecdotes about expensive alcohol, including a Louis XIII cognac and a mistakenly overvalued Sam Adams beer, ending with self-deprecating humor.

A discussion about two allegedly rare tequila bottles followed, concluding with them being overpriced.  The conversation shifted to Sirius XM programming, including the World Cup, Ron and Fett's show, and music channels.  Optima Tax Relief, a USA Network show, BTC trucking, Schneider Finance, Instaflex, DiedInHouse.com, and LegalZoom were advertised.  Dennis Falcone joined, discussing his radio experience, show preparation, cross-promotion, radio broadcasting techniques, and mobile DJ work, contrasting his positive attitude with the hosts' cynicism.  They also discussed "The Boneyard" podcast and Falcone attempting to introduce a dark song as a classic oldie.  Music selections were interspersed throughout.

[00:07:30]  and i'm on the edge and i'm doing my reads and i'm like i know my head i'm just i'm gonna back  out any second now and he's like starts giggling i was like what and he just lowers the camera and  he's like there's like fucking 400 people here yeah what he's like the mayor's down there with a  shot of tequila like he goes it would be easier for you to jump than spend the next hour and a  half explaining why you didn't jump and i looked around and there's like little kids around the  glass enclosure like bert bert bert and i looked down there's fucking people waiting for me i'm like  holy shit he goes dude it's 16 seconds and you'll never have to fucking explain why you didn't 
[00:08:00]  jump and i was like and then i just started fucking losing it and i was like fucking i'm  jumping i'm on the top fucking jumping and they're like and everyone's like no we're not ready we're  not ready hold on don't jump and i was like fuck you gotta do it now yeah and i just jumped and it  was the best feeling in the world like i've never that was i said it on the show but it's better than  the birth of my second child like wow it's like the first one you really remember and then your  second one you're like i remember that kind of um i think it was xanax we watched uncle buck  and then but i got on the ground and i was like i was alive there's a moment when you do these 
[00:08:30]  crazy fucking events like where you do like bungee jumping in la we're off a bridge and you that  moment where the ride works where the thing works and you don't fucking die where you've never felt  more alive in your life like shovel racing in new mexico you just sit on a shovel and go down a  mountain at 70 miles an hour like in snow the first part of shovel racing you're like you're like  scared you're like ah and then all of a sudden you get to like 40 miles an hour and you're going  good and you're going straight and you're like oh i'm fucking halfway down and you're like fucking 
[00:09:00]  charge it you're like those moments i like i get chills thinking about it but that's the sky jump  was like when did it happen for the sky jump of the minute you left with a minute because you don't  slow down until you hit the fucking minute no the minute you feel the pulley system starting to work  like the second you leap you're like motherfucker and then and then all of a sudden you feel your  body go parallel and you're like okay this is working do you feel like you're being lowered  or falling i heard it's like a controlled descent it's not as it's not as intense as like say like 
[00:09:30]  i did an unattached free fall which they don't do anything it's illegal now but uh they they take you  up in a in a in like a like a fucking tower like a 15 story tower and then take draw you up and there's  a net underneath and then they lower you below the cage in this harness and they just pull a pin and  fall into a net like 12 stories that was there's no fucking feeling like that i mean i sky dove i  went skydiving with rachel ray and that was like cool and crazy but it's like that feeling of free 
[00:10:00]  fall you don't get that on sky jump you definitely it's beautiful it's crazy it's insane and you feel  like you definitely feel like you're free falling for like probably 12 seconds 15 16 seconds but it's  not as intense like bungee jumps in more is more intense in my opinion when you fall into a net  they have to tell you how to land so you don't fucking drive your chin into your fucking  they'll tell you a fucking that's why it's illegal now  they literally i mean they didn't check that thing was so let me tell you something this fucking 
[00:10:30]  ride this it's called uh i forget what it's called uh they won't even show it on my show anymore  like they don't show that episode that i did it in why you did it because a girl got hurt and so  but so they this ride when the guy made this ride he was like this is gonna take over  fucking theme parks this is gonna be the biggest fucking ride ever right so he goes to vegas to the  big coaster convention and puts it in the parking lot and he gets his time to speak and he goes ladies  and gentlemen i'm gonna revolutionize uh theme parks i'm gonna bungee jumps will be obsolete when  you see what i have to offer and if you'd like i have a demonstration waiting for you outside the 
[00:11:00]  fucking whole place stands up walks outside and they see this 15 story tower and i and the guy goes  all we do is we put a guy in that and they start doing it and we draw him up and we take him up there  and we drop him and they drop him and they forgot to raise the net and they kill a guy no first  fucking time when they showed the fucking ride talk about fucking like yeah how do you forget to  raise the net how did he how did he go there's no net that's fine it's happened a bunch of times 
[00:11:30]  like it's happened more times that than is legal and shut the ride down but yeah it was that's insane  one of the craziest moments wow fuck that's why don't you jump and see that's great i can only  do it once that's unbelievable yeah i'm not into heights i can't do how is skydiving was that  really horrifying uh yeah because i'm a micromanager and like anxiety so like i so like i i can totally  get myself into a panic attack easy and the night before i'm sitting i'm in new york we did in new 
[00:12:00]  york and i'm sitting in my hotel room and i start googling deaths skydiving oh that's not gonna help  why so uncomfortably high like you think what would you think the number would be like five a  year i mean like you'd think you'd hear about them for the whole country in 40 like they fuck  they die all the time man the mayor of pennsylvania some town in pennsylvania died like the week after  i went like it happens constantly and so uh it's i was my whole fear is like what if the chute doesn't 
[00:12:30]  open yeah yeah that's that's the biggest that's your thing and that's pretty much it that's it  that's the only thing you give a shit about and so we rachel was sitting next to me i haven't flown  sober in 20 years and i'm flying sober backwards in some dude's lap and i'm grabbing rachel's leg  like fucking panicked and she's like she's freaking out like calm down and then she says whatever you  do don't watch me go out of the plane i was like why she was like just don't and of course i'm like  i'm fucking watching now you're gonna get sucked out of the plane just like like in a movie and i i see 
[00:13:00]  that and i start losing it and then the guy's like we're next and i'm like ah and i'm i'm doing  all the nervous hand things to stop and the first drop you feel that it's awesome feeling but then  there is a moment when you're screaming at the earth three miles above the earth at 120 miles an  hour where your brain says what if the chute doesn't open and then the only rational thought  is fuck it like there's nothing i can do about this yeah done when you're falling how do you not  i'm sorry how do you not flail and kick isn't that your instinct you hold on to they tell you just  hold on to your uh straps and uh and we'll do everything the guy said to me he's like you can't 
[00:13:30]  kill us like that's what he said he's like you can't in my head i'm like i can totally fucking  kill us i bet i could kill us i guarantee you i could fucking kill us oh was you he was a tandem  jump okay hold on what if you punched him and knocked him out yeah i was like in my head i was  like i could think of ten ways yeah i bet i could come up the most original way to kill us  that you never fucking saw come you're not gonna do it on purpose but all of a sudden you'll lose it  because you're freaked out and knock him out well he said he's like if at like six thousand feet or 
[00:14:00]  five three thousand feet an emergency chute will open yeah it's like set on an altimeter yeah so  oh is that how they do that so you well it's an emergency thing you have to pull it but there are  chutes that will open when you hit a certain altitude if you get knocked out or how do you know  what the what the fucking height is you have a watch that has an alt it's an altimeter like  so it's what if it falls off it's not gonna fall off jimmy this is all no but these are all the  thoughts i was having yeah yeah jimmy's innocent questions are adorable but it's true what if your 
[00:14:30]  watch fucking breaks yeah oh exactly what if you had a fucking bird and you find like i always think  oh wow yeah right that hurt and that hurt not at 120 miles an hour fuck out it would be like  catching a foot to the face out of a car window oh oh that would fucking like fabio on the  roller coaster when they hit the bird hit him in the face that was talking about luck i know i um  can we take a break yeah we can do that could you stay bert yeah of course we got linda hogan at uh

[00:29:00]  having topless basketball in front of a crowd yeah probably saying it to a whole world of human  beings and then you don't you know drop a tit on the table it's a birthday she dances at headquarters  so she probably wants people to come into headquarters why would anybody go see her there  she didn't sell it to that horrendous here's a cake i'm leaving i think she didn't have the cake  i'm leaving yeah it was awful she wouldn't even show her breasts you know what some of these  chicks get intimidated till they're actually bouncing up and down on your cock  it's like everybody loosens up when that's happening i don't think that was it though 
[00:29:30]  no it wasn't it she just they just came in norton today you know she did it like you did not fail  me you know what you're saying she did it like it was just the job i've had people  fucking she hated being here dice right i got my she was excited she wasn't excited she actually was  looking at all your stuff online my doctor my doctor was sexier when she fucking told me i had herpes  no well you know i got a beautiful you know i love when they get that like when you're going

[00:30:30]  really good at this oh my god she's probably so intimidated by she's not intimidated no she just  was going to want to be here she didn't want to be here i know one thing that doesn't intimidate her  donuts if you guys want to see a girl who will not take her top off feel free to go to that club  and watch her laney's usually really good for us i am you really are i am but you know she's she's  a dancer go get another one go up go get somebody else but that's why we never i mean i love  another birthday that's why we don't take dancers that's why we don't have them come in because 
[00:31:00]  they always pull that shit the dancers do it's not like we wanted to touch her or anything  let me suck your tits none of that stuff you just want to see your tits but like you you're going  to play topless basketball true to viewership you dance naked and you won't show your tits  you know what i mean true to fucking viewers what the fuck you think you're doing in here exactly  because you're so fucking smart you know what i miss the most in moments like this patrice o'neal  would he have been a treat with that yeah oh he'd have laid out he'd have laid out the scenario 
[00:31:30]  perfectly that's why we don't like dancers i don't think she's probably used to this  all right she's going to play basketball for dennis robin of course i think it was her first time  on national radio doesn't matter it doesn't matter go out there you've got a whole floor full of  chicks sitting around playing with a computer throw one in here they flash the tits everybody goes home  a winner that's why we never we don't want to take dancers that's why exactly they always do 
[00:32:00]  shit like that they always do that you what do you mean you don't want to why i'm not going to grab  you that's why i never even got into going to strip clubs because i know it's just all the  fucking show you know what i mean it's all professional like we're comics we know what the  they come in there they give the fake seduction and it's not interested no no not at all not  fucking interested i want a real who uh that really likes opening the fucking legs and just  right to your right fucking yam bag you fucking pig what you are somebody that cares about what

[00:54:30]  hey let me ask you laney's a pimp let me see laney we're good with you by the way you don't have  to try so hard now laney what is going on in your head right now like you see this as being  i'm not thinking not some give her a mic somebody's or a mic there or no i had the mic mic  yeah i'm not like you know it's nothing no but i want to see it  why not because that's too much what's too much you're silly why  of course who cares i was promised a legitimate interview and there's a lot of kind of behavior 
[00:55:00]  going on in here i was promised a legitimate interview this is an unsavory moment yeah yeah  laney do you see this as being an appearance that kind of went like you saw this was about  to become a tremendous disaster yes yeah it was heading down that road i've been down that road  yeah yeah you have laney but we treat girls who are really cool we treat you guys we've had a  couple run out crying but yeah that was a misunderstanding out of all the girls to have 
[00:55:30]  just two or three yeah run out crying that's not bad you know what we know what went wrong now you're  good honest with you the fact that kenny would not let me come in with her i think like she came  blaming kenny for this whole thing no but you're kenny kenny's been told here's the thing kenny doesn't  know that you you're actually one of the ones who can come in kenny doesn't know that we've told  him no publicist you're different um but he's seen me come in with the girls but it just makes  a little bit of a big joke kenny you have to do i have to do he doesn't remember with him every time 
[00:56:00]  i come back oh wow all right can't you just have a problem with me wait first of all is laney okay  what happened to laney are you okay he always has a problem with me and and has to mention my name  every chance you get sit down laney don't yell at her she just got smashed the door went right  into her back sit down he didn't mean to do it oh my god this is crazy are you okay yeah holy  shit oh man well that took a turn for the worst you can't see you coming through the door i know it 
[00:56:30]  was an accident he came in like kramer he's a big guy that was scary oh my god all of that weight  against the door wow yeah i'm 14 a comment you got a comment it's just it's just it's like one of  anthony's old relationships yeah it's fucking it started up great and it's fucking ugly and then 
[00:57:00]  it's all right and now it's just now it's just now it's just fucking weird that was just the glass  being thrown at me in that jacuzzi yeah so so does laney have a problem with dice uh with uh kenny sorry  dice no no it's just um i i wanted to i usually come in with the girls which i mean i've been  coming in with the girls for a while and um he he stopped me and told me i couldn't come in and  it's just it usually helps a lot if someone's new to the show to see them just sitting yeah yeah 
[00:57:30]  and it always works and watch that door might swing open on you once before he like didn't you  know for some reason when he's there he doesn't want me to come in it's crazy i don't know is your back  okay i'm okay man you took a fucking hit okay we're gonna have to build back up to the  pussy i don't know how we do that i can't believe it's turned to violence  that's what i mean if you would have done the legitimate interview none of this would have  happened the charlie rose thing you know we need charlie rose now i gotta feel bad people are getting

[01:06:00]  woman why it's like politic politic politic this is the last one let me tell you something i do my  wife and i've and i've said this before i've never been with a white woman never yeah ever ever  ever why you didn't have a desire you didn't have a desire i mean because i'm sure they were going for  you never but it always felt like that it always felt like it's not natural not naturally organic  things people just go through i'd like to fuck a black guy and you're the one up on the deck and i i never  i did it always thought not to say that didn't happen like you're a you're a checklist 
[01:06:30]  why are you going through my hair products i just wanted to see what this was but that's not the  worst thing in the world no but it's just part of someone's bucket list right almost but i i you know  i just have black women just do it for me they do not for me like they do it but uh did you go hispanic  at least uh yeah like if if my wife ever was hit by a train i think i'm going what about asian yeah  no no i don't i don't think i'm just trying to see how racist he is how racist he is 
[01:07:00]  i think it's a racist thing they don't like white girls and asian girls is like really no  they really are like you know yeah we're trying to make a bunch of tiger woods i talked to you  do you realize there's a lot of really hot white girls out there there are okay all right  no really i get it and i'm not look see i wanted to go black and just never uh went black  see how come nobody says how come he didn't go with a black guy i was scared oh yeah we ask all  the time you say with a black guy they're intimidated the black guy right that could 
[01:07:30]  be a different yeah we've asked but he said he's got no game me he's got no game to get a  fucking no i used to uh i tell the story when i lived in buffalo i would go to some of these black  clubs i was looking for and i was just intimidated by what i've seen really yeah i grew up pretty  nerdy though deal it's like uh you know you like spicy food but it hurts your stomach  that's how it is i love you but i know i'm gonna pay after i'm with you like i know it's gonna be bad 
[01:08:00]  like what i i but i think that that's part of uh it's like never being able to kind of rope the wind  it's it feels to me like my wife is always like after all this time we still have the arguments of a  teenage couple oh really yeah like like she got mad at me because i told that very joke  where i said well if my wife get hit by a train maybe i'll you know and she went what if people  think you get it that's such a fucking unrealistic who gets hit by a train anymore 
[01:08:30]  we live in calabasas california what trains are coming through  like where are you walking in front of a train right they don't just come out of nowhere either  you know you know what their tracks yeah yeah there's bells and stuff right you've been on a train  it's not like a car that all of a sudden jumps the sidewalk  and she really got mad and she gets mad about like like like my wife is is like well maybe we  should have some more kids i'm done with that yeah how many you got again deal three three i don't 
[01:09:00]  want and they're older right they're older and i'm happy and i'm cool and it just i think that  something happens to women like you were talking about that when a woman gets older they go insane  wondering what you're doing like i'm like young ass and but i'm coming home right right yeah i get it  i don't want to be with you if i wanted to be somewhere else i'd be somewhere else right  literally my kids are grown got a couple houses there's no reason there's no if i didn't want to 
[01:09:30]  be here right i wouldn't be so you shouldn't catch any shit for coming home right but you know  but what are you thinking that ain't how it goes it doesn't matter it ever goes right yeah  it's right are you in hell deal no you're right i just some of the arguments i have with her  uh are arguments that that there's a certain unreasonableness that a woman just is built in  with it like i'm like are you retarded you are you're slow yeah like it's almost like you don't get 
[01:10:00]  it yeah but you gotta stand out she's home right you're out on the road you're doing comedy you're  a good-looking dude right right uh you know you're funny you're on you know shows you have books coming  out you get you know dude we're on the road a lot you know the stuff that's coming up to us she's home  just home well become a comic 
[01:10:30]  i want to come on the road with you i go on the road to get away from you guys  i know i know this is not the caravan of love to work when you go on the road you don't take your  chick with you no right right my side chick yeah but you're crazy no i don't take her either  listen i i don't i i think monogamy is a fairly uh you only give monogamy to a woman so she leaves  you let me that's not a natural thing you know right it's a gift it's a decision it's a decision 
[01:11:00]  from a man yeah you decide to give her what she needs so she'll to not kill herself yeah yeah so it's  not it's not like natural like no if they had shots for shit that you could get rid of in 24  hours i'd be are you crazy i'd be on an ivy antibiotic drip drip is that crystal geyser in a way  but that's the thing and i think now is is that is that it really you can tell that her my kids are 
[01:11:30]  grown and her she's wondering what she she's gonna be and so it that's a tough like you go  through these transitions like right right and so this is a she's done the mom thing a black girl  though it will put up a a bigger fight about everything but then and then a white girl you  can kind of yell at and make her cry yes you know what i mean you know i you should thank me for  fucking them because that's what brought me to you oh mommy somebody's used that before yeah 
[01:12:00]  no kidding that was an improv people that's in the repertoire you should call that whore up but thank  her for eating my ass because that made me realize i didn't want that and now i'm with you right  how would i know i want a regular right that's i wish i could say shit like that oh my god your wife  would fucking this is the thing i've actually made my wife so mad recently i thought she's  gonna kill me i was like i i was scared to go to sleep literally and even if she's like say she cut 
[01:12:30]  my throat and i live yeah i would have to go testify so she wouldn't go to jail like i've been there  no your honor she's a good woman please passive aggressive black women though like i don't live  with them i don't know what they are i've heard of them right my wife is passive aggressive no like  she'll do the old silent scorn the thumping of the feet upstairs you know because i know she's just 
[01:13:00]  to let me know she's pissed about something oh god i hate that i hate silent scorn yeah the loud  walking no one likes it but some people could deal with it better you think oh god i don't know if  anyone deals with that yeah this is a certain amount of things you gotta you gotta you gotta do it's  like uh and my wife can be passive aggressive but my wife like she goes to church i won't go  um she is very uh outgoing she likes a lot of community and family and she likes all that and  i have to i have to do it because if i'm when i'm home i have to i have to do it but i think 
[01:13:30]  she just likes she she she wants me to she now it's this thing where she wants me to she's trying  to mold me into being this guy i'm not like don't tell jokes like that i'm not oh no this is who i am  yeah yeah yeah this is what you used to like about right right this is i'm this dude i am i'm  loud i get high i don't this is what i yeah yeah let's get high yeah and and and and the what happened 
[01:14:00]  and like you say you're you're coming home to sometimes girls don't realize too you can't deal  shit out for things guys aren't doing right because coming on with herpes they will start  doing it right it's a terrible thing but yeah yeah you don't like the sense of humor because i've  gotten shit over the years with girls for what i say on this show you could you could you know you  say shit on the show it's like what did that mean or what who was that you were talking it's like  look i'm trying to fill four fucking hours on here shut it you know i just say you like that

[01:25:00]  i used to have that joke i'm act like my mother said it all the time it meant nothing my father  said i loved you once and i cried my eyes out i was like oh my god no no you know because he never  said it it's the same thing with your wife if you give them too much of that high school relationship  stuff they take it for granted and then when you do say it and you really feel you have a look at your  girl and go like i fucking man i love you and they go oh you want ketchup  i'm gonna fucking kill you bitch it's a shame that you you're married and still are trying to play 
[01:25:30]  games like you're still you're married and you're in a relationship but you're still trying to uh you  know do all these oh i better not i better pay this out a little bit like i i adore my wife i do not  there's a certain amount of annoying that all women have yeah okay how great they are yeah how wonderful i  i i mean it's people in the bible ain't as good as my wife but she is a woman and women at a certain  point are fucking unreasonable and annoying like that's fair yeah like no matter i don't give a 
[01:26:00]  fuck what package they come in they are unreasonable and annoying and it's it's like you you you my wife  we were shooting i i did a documentary it comes out october 27th where i'm trying to get the black  man put on the endangered species list right it's hilarious my wife comes while i'm shooting the thing  and i'm you know you know how it is to shoot all day and she's like i came to new york  he goes no last week i did that's over i came to new york to be with you and you haven't spent 
[01:26:30]  any time with me because oh man you're working and you are you are you serious are you this is  that like a real argument like yeah yeah i i was you're with me while i fall asleep because i've  been working 18 hours that's what the fuck this is yeah so it's it's like that and it's it's almost  like uh my wife came to the set last week and i i was really expecting her this is the it's when  you have expectations of your chick is usually when they fucking just drop the ball because i was 
[01:27:00]  her to be like this is amazing like you know this is wow and she was walking around like i do this  every week i'm a lead in a pilot this is a moment in my i'm a lead in a pilot this is a career  highlight i'm like oh my god this may in this business may never happen again right and she  walked in like this bitch has been on set like she has a chair with a name on it but you know what 
[01:27:30]  some women are they're acting like this is not new because they're expecting you to do it again  right like really they don't like one time i remember i'll never forget this one time i was  innocent we i was somewhere and and i was really intimidated socially intimidated my wife pulled  me over she said don't you ever act like you don't belong here never act like that never my wife  i have the best like i got a chick uh i knocked the chick up we were married right right and um so 
[01:28:00]  my it fucked me up so the baby you know guy it was a horrible story so i finally it was  so overcome with guilt that i told my wife i said i had a baby and it's crazy and and and the chick  is trying to blackmail me and i feel so you know my wife said to me i wish you told me we could have  went through that together you said that to me so i'm coming off the plane and the bride that i have  the baby by it's at the airport and she sees me and my wife another plane and she you can see that 
[01:28:30]  glint in her eye like i can get this i can do i can finally out this dude and i go and i walk up to  with my wife and i say uh this is the girl i had the baby by jesus this is my wife my wife goes  i'm so sorry for your loss wind out of her sales though right and i and i went i'll never  i'll never not love this woman i mean that was is that a difference between a black girl and a white  girl because i i've can imagine going home and telling your wife that if i told my wife 
[01:29:00]  i think it's two different people too because you you you say in a smoother way like i would go home  nervous and be like listen there was this redhead in Cleveland she sat on my dick i'd lie and tell  the truth halfway through like i she fell on my dick i came because i i wasn't jerking off because  i wanted to have a baby with you that's why i came too quick i don't know dude i'm there's no way 
[01:29:30]  good for dl but that's uh that's some that's one in a million that's the one in a million and so  now when she acts when she acts like that i remember yeah and and like the girl don't think  i'm not going to use that if i ever get a white friend dl's wife yeah yeah she understood she got  it and my wife the girl you know confidence bitch yeah in our relationship absolutely what what she's 
[01:30:00]  fucked up but mostly the girl is and obviously she's fucked up and my wife uh about two three  years ago she calls and she's on hard time my wife was sending her money jesus christ to me she  was sending her money and i could not i was like and i couldn't argue with her about i did she have  the kid she had the kids so that that kid's out there somewhere no the kid's gone it was just a  tragic it was horrible but okay you're you're not getting into it yeah yeah so but but but she but 
[01:30:30]  she the the in the wood i didn't have to tell because the baby didn't do right yeah yeah but  it just and i never feel bad about shit that i do like i never did but that always bothered me  and i was just always i was like i would hate for somebody to walk up to her and tell us and stuff  like that yeah horrible well that well that's a good thing also that because that's that was probably  a lot of stress on you oh man just always waiting for someone to pop out of the fucking woodwork  wow and then and it happened and i was like blow it up i was like i'm gonna tell her she'll leave 
[01:31:00]  and i'll never and then i told her she went i wish you told me we could have went to that look at  that's like some old back in the day when cowboys used to go i've i fucking i had a baby with her  like lonesome dove shit you know it's wrong my yeah that's that's that's the way men used to be  yeah yeah i had a baby with that woman i was on the road for six months trying to get you some  all right right yeah dude that's that like yeah i think we don't do that we don't do that anymore 
[01:31:30]  because we don't want to deal with that like the the fucking the thought of dealing with that would  make me not come in a chick like that's why you don't do it because yeah it's like like  fuck that i just don't want to even oh my god i i even thinking of that is fucking petrifying yeah  so it's like fuck it i just won't fuck you now you know when i hear myself i go wow that's probably  why she's like she's been through so much with me that damn she's a soldier yeah she's but i but i 
[01:32:00]  i think i remember when i was a i was a kid and we were dating and we were at redondo beach and  and um you know what simoans are the dinosaur didn't die he became a simoan the biggest people  on the fucking yeah they're flatbacks yeah they are a fucking whore yeah so we're walking by and one  of those she falls into me and i go what what happened and they started laughing so i knew  instantly that somebody had that slapped their ass right so i'm i'm 140 pounds simoans are no joke  and i said take the keys and go to the car she said no i'm not gonna do it she said you you can't 
[01:32:30]  win i said i know but if i don't try you'll never look at me the same way again never what happened  and i got the worst ass whooping oh shit how did you try to just ask question how'd you start it off  like i want to know did you go for the balls or something who did it and he said i did and  i and i read you looked up and he just i don't even i like how can he be hitting me from all these  angles and he literally did he go like this can you smell it wasn't like one of those things where you go

He was the kid.  Or one of the really young guys.  And now you're 45.  How many kids you got?  Three girls.  Three girls.  This is 13.  I got a little kid hanging around the house now.  Oh, man.  I can't believe how old we are.  I'm less sure.  I do, but I can't say that because I don't know if my neighbors listen. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah, you can't do that.  I think the kid, I'm pretty sure the kid is...  Something's going on?  He just doesn't know your wife decorate.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  No, you're good.  You're good.  Yeah, no, I'm pretty confident.  It's a good problem to have.  He's like, Mr. Brewer, your new shades match your walls.  What 12-year-old child says that?  No such.  None.  None.  One that wants to fucking keep coming to the house without the father thinking anything.  He goes, I want to know I'm not overwhelming my stay. 
[02:07:00]  Am I still okay if I could use your pool?  Like, yeah, you can do...  He wears a college shirt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I'm all right.  No, you're good.  You're good.  You're good, man.  I feel confident.  Yeah, no, you're all right.  She's 13 and she looks like what?  18?  She looks like she's 18.  Well, maybe he's really smart and maybe he's throwing the fucking psyche.  That's what I think.  That's what I think.  That's what I think.  That's what I think.  That's what I think.  That's what I think.  That's what I think.  Hey, he's pulling a Bill Russell.  He's pulling a Bill Russell on it.  Yeah, yeah.  He may be doing that.  That could be.  Imagine that. 
[02:07:30]  He's like, hey, listen, I'm going to make your dad think I'm gay.  Yeah.  He has no idea how deep we're going in this relationship.  Oh, man.  Because even now, when he talks to her, he stands really close, but he frails with his  wrist, but he'll touch her arm and stuff.  But she doesn't give an ounce.  She doesn't give an ounce.  She doesn't give.  Have you spoken to her about how far the relationship is going?  Yeah, she shuts it down instantly.  She's like, no.  Yeah.  No.  No.  She's clearly showed who she's liked. 
[02:08:00]  But she's a smart cat, too.  I don't know if she's playing with my emotions, either.  Look at you.  You've got to fucking try to figure all this shit out.  I'm going to start trying to transvestite just to keep boys away for the last eight years.  I'd hang out with you more.  That's the only thing I'll keep shooting you away.  Yeah, you would.  Yeah, you would.  Yeah, you would.  You may even be able to buy me.  Man, the fucking mind games that are going on.  You've got to figure out if they're bullshitting you about their sexuality.  I know how to change you.  I'll bring them to the movie Spider-Man.  Let them sit in the back. 
[02:08:30]  And then I'll see what's going on.  That's what the kids do now, too.  They sit in the back of the movie.  They want to get dropped off the movie theater.  Oh, shit.  That's what goes on in my town.  I've got a lockdown in my town.  Dropped off the movie theater.  They sit in the back.  And they pretend they're seeing the movie.  They wait until you turn the corner.  And they go, suck bass.  And this and that.  This and that.  Yeah.  It's a nightmare.  I love that he's saying this like this is a brand new thing.  To me, it is.  This is what we used to do.  That is true.  I remember a fingering girl during Friday the 13th, the original movie.  During the Defiant one, some guy got blown. 
[02:09:00]  That is Defiant.  It really is.  Oh, my God.  I wasn't in that world for years, though.  I was playing stickball until I was 15, 16.  Yeah.  Hockey.  No chicks, though?  Come on.  I would show off with the chicks, but I wasn't.  Yeah, you weren't.  It wasn't happening, right?  No.  That was all of that.  We were 14-year-olds.  That was all we wanted, though.  Yes.  Like, my crowd of guys I hung out with. 
[02:09:30]  It was just all any of us wanted.  We just didn't get it.  And, of course, you knew every girl wanted a fucking 69 Nova full of degenerates.  Right.  You got any friends?  Right.  It's the last thing they wanted.  69 Nova, now that's a...  You know how much that car's worth now?  I know.  It's fucking crazy.  Not after I was done with it.  The Plymouth Duster.  Remember those?  The Plymouth Duster.  That was a great one.  My brother had a Duster.  Let's go out in a Duster tonight.  Fucking A.  I had a Nova.  Chevy Nova.  73 Nova.  Hit the gas, faggot.  No.  What are you doing?  Hit the gas. 
[02:10:00]  Get big fucking cars in the back, faggot.  Get the J.C. Whitney catalog and fucking get some good shit for it.  That thing loaded down in the back of, where was it?  Green Acres Mall.  It was the only white guy.  Green Acres Mall.  What the hell is that?  Long Island.  Valley Stream.  Oh, Jesus.  Valley Stream.  Oh.  Yeah.  South Shore trash.  I love it.  South Shore?  White trash.  South Shore is trash.  The Long Island.  The fucking expressway is like the Mason Dixon line of fucking Long Island. 
[02:10:30]  It really was.  You stay over there, I'll stay over here.  You stay over here.  What would Carl think?  What?  What would Carl think?  Oh, Carl.  Wow.  I can't believe you brought Carl up.  My favorite.  My favorite person living or imagined.  I knew he would be.  Who's Carl?  I don't remember Carl.  You guys just, he knows why it's coming down the street.  Hey, listen.  The jungle's back the other way.  You're out of your neighborhood.  There's no fruits in these trees, if you know what I'm saying. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, it was one of those neighborhoods.  Meanwhile, that was my dad.  Rick in the lawn.  Hey, the jungle's back that way, LeBron.  There's no one to mug here.  We're all watching each other.  Heading back to the...  Oh, man.  Hey, do you ever do more of your documentary?  What?  Do you ever do more of that documentary?  No, but I think I'm going to...  You should, dude.  You should, man.  Well, I've been thinking about it, and I think I may do it in the fall.  I almost called you once from a lobby. 
[02:11:30]  I was just thinking, you're like, fucking, would you keep filming?  You got more there.  No, you're right.  I'm going to film in the fall.  What's the documentary?  Him and his own land.  You would like it.  What is it?  I took my dad on tour.  He was 84, 85 at the time.  Bro, I'm on the...  He's a World War II vet, never talks about shit.  Right, of course.  Just talks about chick.  If you ask him, hey, what was the war like?  He goes, Australia was fantastic.  Had us on leave for two weeks.  That's all he'll go. 
[02:12:00]  So it really was about...  I know he's not going to be living much longer.  He's starting to get senile.  Great idea.  I brought him on the road.  It was touching.  It was sad.  It was a little disturbing at times.  It's really good.  It is.  It's really good.  I fucking love it.  From what I saw, that's right up my alley.  But the conclusion should be...  There's more information now.  I think he should film more with his dad now.  Yes.  He's getting worse.  See, he can talk about the war. 
[02:12:30]  Maybe you can get him to talk about it.  You know what?  They won't.  They won't.  They won't.  You see in the documentary, I ask him the main time.  But that's okay.  I mean, that would be interesting to watch you try to make him talk about it.  Not that you'd watch it.  I would watch it.  I'd probe him literally every...  We'd go to dinner, and I'll go, so what was the worst place?  And he'll go, what the fuck do you want to know?  And I'd say, which island's the worst?  He goes, they were all worse.  Hey, look at that hot ass. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah, he doesn't want to.  Just to flex, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  But you know what?  Shit, I have Alzheimer's now.  Dementia.  I was going to ask you something when you were...  Oh, so does he mind the cameras when you're shooting him?  No, he's a ham and a scene stealer.  Oh, okay.  Like, we're in...  What's great is because he's older, so we're in a diner.  And the chick comes up, and I had to edit a lot.  I mean, he drops C words.  He's really...  Are you ever going to keep those in? 
[02:13:30]  I had to edit.  Oh, that's great.  Come on.  Were you ever embarrassed?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Like, the one place we were at, we're in the diner, and she comes up, and he's going,  you know, he's a fag, right?  And then she'd walk away.  She's like, she's a cunt.  She didn't get it.  And then I go, oh, God.  I didn't get it.  And then...  Like, there's something to get just by pointing at someone saying, I need some fag.  I need some fag.  You know what I'm saying?  I get it.  He must be a fag.  I get it. 
[02:14:00]  She didn't get it.  You would...  The best thing about him, I used to introduce him to stars, like, whenever it started.  And by far the best ever.  Now, this is years ago.  This is Paul Abdul.  Just to still explain my dad.  I go to the bathroom.  We're finishing the SNL party.  I go to the bathroom, and the party's 5,000 people there, and you're kissing.  Hey, you're fucking great.  Hey, you're great.  Let's do things together.  I come back.  Let's do things together.  Did they say that at the parties? 
[02:14:30]  Oh, my God.  Every single one.  Yeah, no, keep in touch.  I'm still looking for a job.  I come back, and Paul Abdul is with him, laughing.  He's naughty.  I said, what's...  Yeah, now I already know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something transpired.  He goes like this, which to me is still the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life.  He goes, Paula, you like playing poppy?  And she goes, what's poppy? 
[02:15:00]  That's when I sniff your ass and you just growl.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's like he was eight.  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking...  Oh, wow.  And she's like...  I'm going to take him home.  Now you think about your dad.  Now you think about your dad and what he was like on the two weeks leave in Australia that  he talks about being the greatest two weeks of his life.  How insane was that trip?  After it took out a week-long shower to take the Japanese blood off his body. 
[02:15:30]  You know he saw...  They just strung Mussolini up and killed him and then went to Australia to drink and get  laid for two weeks.  What were they saying that?  Oh, yeah.  I can only imagine what that...  And they were conquering heroes.  That's right.  They were huge heroes.  And those guys wear those hats.  I always go up to any vet with a hat because they want you to go, hey, man, nice, nice.  All right, yeah, yeah.  Nice fucking hat. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you so much.  Oh, yeah.  I think last time I was here, right, he was a guy with a hat.  I went up to him and shot Bright.  I said, World War II vet, thank you very much.  And he goes, three years, eight months, 22 days, 1942, blah, blah, blah, we bought...  Oh, he rattles it off.  He just rattled the whole thing off.  Wow.  Because they want it because they know it's over.  Chap bodies up to my knees as we storm that beach.  I have a flamethrower.  Germans coming at me from the sky. 
[02:16:30]  Japanese coming at me from the ground.  We'd set them on fire so we wouldn't waste bullets.  Right.  Jesus.  Shit that we will never, ever do in our lives.  No.  I can't comprehend it.  Shit.  You know, Durning was on Rescue Me.  And he was, he was, he was landed at Normandy and he was in the Battle of the Bulge.  Jesus.  He's got one half of, I think it's his right leg, is still black from the frostbite from  one of the battles.  Oh.  And he's got, he's got a mark in his chest that looks like somebody took a claw hammer  and dug it into his chest is from when he was killing a Nazi guy and the guy's hand 
[02:17:00]  was clawing as he was crushing the guy's face with a rock.  Charles Durning?  Charles Durning.  Wow.  Face to face and he's got a reminder like that.  But he never talked about it.  He would never talk about it.  And, and I couldn't get him to talk about it.  I wrote some, I'd write stuff into the scripts and he would say it, but he would never talk  about it.  Right.  So then I went to do the Memorial Day thing one weekend, you know, when they were out of  the troops on PBS with Joe Mantegna and Sinise in Washington and he was getting honored that  year.  And when I saw him backstage, when he was waiting to be introduced and I saw Colin Powell and 
[02:17:30]  the heads of all four military who were about, you know, to go on stage, walk up individually,  he was sitting down and shake his hand and talk to him.  I went, wow.  All right.  He did something.  Yeah.  He did something.  You know?  I got, yeah.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  Those guys didn't talk.  It's weird.  We never talk about it.  They say that they, a lot of them wish they had therapy and stuff because it was healthier.  But they fucking, those guys just didn't talk about that stuff.  I asked, I asked Durning about therapy and this is a famous showbiz story. 
[02:18:00]  I'd heard that he once held a William Morris agent outside the window who didn't pay him  upside down, like 15, 20 stories in the air.  Right?  Should night.  Right?  Yeah.  So I asked him one time, I said, is it true that story about you holding the William Morris agent  upside down, like 20 stories in the air?  He goes, it was 15 stories.  And yeah, that was my therapy after the war.  And I was like, holy shit.  Wow.  Well, that's, I also, this, I started learning about my dad by the, by the town bully. 
[02:18:30]  And there was, they were the Delapines.  And, and when you grew up and anyone that was in jail, you're like, holy shit, the fucking  Delapines are in jail.  Don't fuck with the Delapines.  Kids stole my bike.  All that shit.  It was eight of them.  Three of them were armed robbery.  The phone in jail.  Oh, man.  But they were out.  So, cut to, I'm 12 years old.  And this is, this is when I realized, like, my dad's, there's something fucking off with 
[02:19:00]  my dad.  My dad is, and he's a little guy.  He's, he's smaller than me.  The, the main Delapine is on my front porch.  He rings the bell.  My dad's already passed out from the fucking beer.  My mom's marked two, three martinis in.  That was the routine.  And your dad's beer is a fucking Sue Simmons.  He's out.  Sue Simmons.  He went local.  I got to get monkeys.  All monkeys.  All monkeys.  Let's guess who did that.  Monkeys.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:30]  Stay out of the seats.  Stay out of the, my God.  They're out.  They're out called.  The door rings, Delapines, at the front door.  I actually have a heart attack.  Like, I'm so scared, I, I, I almost start crying.  And he goes, he's looking right past me.  He goes, we want to talk to your father.  And I went, my, my father's sleeping.  And I look out.  I swear on my children's lives. 
[02:20:00]  There's three of them on my porch.  And there's two standing in my walkway and more outside their car, leaning against the car.  And I go, my, my dad's sleeping.  I feel a claw grab me, pull me aside.  And he, my father walks out on the patio.  And he goes, wait there, fucking, one, two, three, four, five, seven, how many car?  Yeah, three fags.  There's seven of you for one little old man?  He goes, you may get the best of me, but one of you are going to fucking die. 
[02:20:30]  Which one's it going to be?  Is it going to be you?  Is it going to be you?  Which one of you fucks are going to die tonight?  Because you're going to watch one of you fuckers die.  And my mom's like, Jesus Christ, you're in the goddamn house and we're calling the cops and his son's a cop.  And the whole fucking deli, now the oldest brother's going, we're just, we're just, you hit a chain. 
[02:21:00]  You hit my little brother with a chain.  And he takes out of his back pocket the dog leash, which we had a poodle.  Oh.  A little poodle.  And he's like, this is what you're worried about?  He goes, again, you got five seconds.  Because I want to get it on.  Who's going to die?  And they were like, oh, we really apologize.  You fucking mean it.  And they left.  And that was a defining moment the rest of my life.  I just, I looked at my dad like, were you fucking crazy? 
[02:21:30]  Do you know they have guns?  He's like, oh, I fucking care.  Guns?  I would have loved, see, I would have loved to have one of the delipines die in that story.  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  From a death blow to the neck as your father throws a warning sign.  What's this?  What's this?  The boy coming out of every hole in his head?  What is he giving a fuck?  He was in World War II?  He doesn't give a fuck about the delipines?  Fuck you.  And that's when I realized.  I love your dad. 
[02:22:00]  I do too.  I haven't even met him, but I love him.  I can't wait to see this fucking documentary.  That is great.  It really is good, Dennis.  You're going to love it, man.  It really is good.  And it will be so many hours.  A lot more people should be seeing this damn thing.  You'll fucking love it.  It's hot, man.  How long is it?  It's an hour.  I'll make it longer.  You told me, and you really made me think about it.  I'm definitely going to do it.  I got a nurse, so you got to clean.  He wears diapers and shit.  On that trip, he shit three times.  Oh, man.  That's a rough thing to clean up. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fun to do for a film.  You should film more if you can, though.  I am.  I am.  I just booked a whole fall tour.  Oh, you did?  I want to get a bus and just film the shit out of him.  Because he's still funny.  Yeah, he fucking sounds it, man.  The ambulance comes over the house.  He looks like he's dying, right?  Everything out of his mouth is always funny.  He always tries to be funny no matter what.  They go, Mr. Brewer, you okay?  You're in pain? 
[02:23:00]  He goes, yeah, I'm in pain.  Where's it hurting?  He goes, I'm pregnant.  I don't know who the father is, and I wouldn't tell you, because then you'd start rumors.  While he's drooling and his heads are twitching.  Can you imagine what he was like in the war?  Oh, man.  He literally was like that guy from Die Hard doing fucking one-liner, white-ass-one-liner.  He was telling people.  Non-stop.  He must have been a fucking blast to hang out with in the war.  Well, you know what's funny? 
[02:23:30]  Oh, man.  I would say so, because as I grew up, he was just a dad, and it was my college year where  kids would go, you're a brewer, because he's a lot older, everyone thinks he's a grandfather.  They go, your father, does he drive a garbage truck?  I go, yeah, like, oh my, dude, I had your father for the time.  He's the funniest fucking guy I ever met in my life.  I'm like, my dad is?  Yeah.  Funniest fucking guy.  And as I got older, I mean, he started fights at town halls. 
[02:24:00]  He was.  Wow.  What a hero.  He was the clown of clowns.  What a hero.  But I didn't realize that as I got older.  So that's another reason I made the documentary.  You never had any war buddies come over or anything like that?  They all worked together.  They all, it was really said, they all worked together at the sanitation place.  They all got each other jobs, and one, two of his best friends died of a heart attack.  They were all heavy fucking drinkers. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  And you blame them?  No.  One, and one hung himself, and one shot himself.  Jesus Christ.  My dad was the only one.  Wow.  My dad was the only one.  That's hardcore, man.  It's a group.  Yeah.  That's crazy right there.  But that makes sense, doesn't it, when you think about it?  Oh, man.  Like, the horrors that they've done?  I mean, fuck.  What they must have been through.  You can't even fucking fathom.  Never, and what I thought was amazing, which I brought out in the doc, is that he never  put all that on me.  Right.  He was just a dad.  Right.  Right.  He was there at the games. 
[02:25:00]  He was at the thing.  He never was like, oh, you fuck.  You want to have my dangling cross-searing?  Oh, no.  Judas Priest on the bag, like, fuck you.  Judas Priest, dad.  The singer's like, hey.  That's great.  That's great.  It's great music.  Never.  Can you imagine what he would have said?  No, can you imagine?  Oh, my God.  You gotta love him for that shit, man.  He's fucking A.  What a guy.  What a guy. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, he could have been that, I defended country for this shit.  Yeah, isn't it what I defended him?  I'm gonna wear your faggot earring and fucking...  How's your mom doing?  I just love that he was out cold.  Just that story about the Della Pines, where he's out cold after Sue Simmons.  But as soon as his son...  As soon as there's a whiff of trouble for his son, not only is he wide awake, he's moved  the son out of the way and has taken on $15 Della Pines.  And doesn't give a fuck, because at least...  I mean, you gotta...  That's a dad.  That's a dad.  Fuck you. 
[02:26:00]  That's a dad.  I love that.  There's like two or three of those incidents that I'll remember forever and ever.  Fucking great, bro.  Fucking animal.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  Five...  Ten brothers and sisters, five...  Just the opposite of band of brothers.  All five went to the war.  All five came back.  Wow.  One was shot down in Germany.  One was a prisoner of war.  I know.  Wow.  The old one came back.  You know, my Uncle Jerry came to this country and was here and to get his citizenship had  to join the army.  So he went to Korea and fought. 
[02:26:30]  Again, came back and he was fucked up and was strapped and all of a sudden...  He always acted like he had a great time, like it was the easiest thing in the world.  But when he died and the guys that he served with came to his funeral, this is like two  years ago, we started hearing all this shit about, oh yeah, no, we used to, you know,  we used to be afraid of him because he was so fucking crazy and they showed us pictures.  We're looking at pictures of him on the front and we're going, he fucking told us he was  like back, you know, behind the seat.  At a motor pool.  Yeah, never said anything.  You know, it's like, just, they fucking locked it up.  They locked it up, threw it away. 
[02:27:00]  Throw it away.  Whiskey.  And the, oh, that's why...  Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey.  Whiskey, whiskey.  Smoke, smoke, smoke.  Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey.  Yeah!  Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey.  Right?  Meanwhile, you go like, you know, you're thinking everything's fine with him.  Now when he dies, you go, fucking guy was crazy.  Right.  Right?  Right.  Thank God he didn't kill you, right?  Thank fucking God.  When I think about how scary our dads were, you know, about, like, when we fucked up, when  they, I don't know if your dad ever threw a shot at you.  Oh, man.  You know, my dad threw a shot at me.  My dad threw a shot at my older brother who challenged him once, Kiwi. 
[02:27:30]  Kiwi was my, he came home drunk after a fight.  My uncle Danny was a police officer.  I was called up and said, he's fucking in a fight with a bunch of guys with shovels.  My dad was like, that's not something.  And he came home and he walked in the front door.  He was already drunk and he went to the refrigerator and he opened it up and he grabbed a beer.  And my old man went, you crack open that beer,  I'll knock you out with one fucking punch.  And my brother was huge.  You know, he's bigger than my dad.  And he cracked the beer.  And I'll never forget it.  He hit him.  And it was like slow motion.  He went backwards.  And his head hit the linoleum.  He was already out.  So hard. 
[02:28:00]  My mother went, you killed him.  And my old man, he hit him.  And he walked away.  And lit up a cigarette.  Like, I told him I was going to fucking hit him.  Yeah.  Right?  This is my...  When you think about what's really in their heads from World War II...  Right.  No.  Crazy.  It is pretty wild.  It's nuts, man.  It's amazing they could live a normal life, you know?  That's what blows me away, too.  I learned a lot.  Because I have sisters and that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was fucking...  This happened to me as a kid.  Like, I...  Anyone that brings up the violin story... 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  ...pretty much about anything...  Like, listen...  Fuck off.  Fuck off.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  These guys are everything.  Fuck yeah.  And they did what you saw.  They were great Americans.  Hey, listen.  And that fucking cliche is true.  We wouldn't fucking be here if they didn't win that fucking war.  It's that simple.  They took on the whole fucking world and kicked the world's ass and came home.  Right.  And then kept their mouths shut and became dads.  And gave us, like, plasma fucking TVs and college.  And all the shit that we have comes from those...  That's why we have this shit.

And the only reason I bring it up today is because Sandusky's son comes out,  his adopted son, and says, yeah, this fucking asshole was, you know, fooling around with me, too.  Oh, jeez.  And I was thinking to myself, that's got to, like, you know, you're adopted into some crazy family sometimes. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, a family that's going to fucking sexually abuse you.  I know you also could do it to your own.  I don't under...  Your own blood, I mean.  You know what I mean?  Right.  But, I mean, that's got to suck.  All the families that want to adopt kids out there, and you get...  You're the lucky one that goes to the Sandusky home?  That sucks.  I never understood that.  I know a few adopted people, not a lot, but...  It worked out very well for you, right?  It was fine for me.  I mean, I was adopted at nine days old. 
[02:34:30]  Nine days?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I don't remember.  You know, and my parents...  I don't remember them telling me I was adopted.  I just always knew.  So they must have started telling me when I was really young.  So my parents did it the right way.  Why do they have to tell you?  I think it's the right thing to do.  Why?  Don't you?  Because I look like a fucking goddamn Sandheeb.  And they don't.  What?  So I'm an Irish explanation for that?  Do you have black parents?  Yeah, right.  That would be great.  I don't know. 
[02:35:00]  I'm not telling you.  Well, Anthony still lets me in his house, so...  That's true.  Yeah.  Do you have any desire to meet the old biological people?  Do you have any people there?  No.  Well, here's the thing with being adopted that sucks.  No matter...  I think this happens to everybody.  No matter how well your parents do it, how right they do it.  There's all this...  I have a lot of subconscious stuff that started coming up when I hit about 30.  29 or 30.  You know, abandonment issues. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, man.  Uh, intimacy issues.  These things start popping up, and you're kind of like...  Weird.  Nine days you were fucking given away there, and it still comes up?  Yeah, because I think your whole life you...  I mean, look, when you're a kid, kids will make fun of you.  Like, when you're in grade school, kids would...  At least I'm not adopted.  You know, people say stuff like that.  Oh, bullied.  Give them a half a mil.  What?  You need a website for Joe DeRozan.  Like that old fat bus broad.  Yeah. 
[02:36:00]  But why do the kids have to know you're adopted?  Uh, because I never thought there was anything, like, strange about it.  I just...  I...  It was just part of my...  Upbringing or whatever.  Thing, yeah.  I just...  I would talk about it like anything else.  Like, I have a brother.  You know what I mean?  Like that, you know...  Do you find it weird that you have a biological mom and dad out there that are just right  now wandering around somewhere, possibly?  That would be so strange for me.  Um, the thing I always worried about with finding them, I don't think I want to find them. 
[02:36:30]  And the thing I was worried about with finding them was that, you know, I'm half Egyptian  and half Italian.  Are you rich?  No.  You might be a Saudi prince.  Well, then you fucking find them, because it's like a lottery.  Well, if I was adopted, I'm looking for my biological parents.  I'm looking for my parents to maybe get, you know...  Let me tell you about how fucking...  A little payout.  Let me tell you the hard ends of that lottery spectrum.  Okay, yeah.  With Egyptians.  Yeah.  Uh, the Italian side I wasn't worried about.  My Egyptian side was what I was worried about.  Because I'm like, on the one hand, they could be fucking barons with those little, uh, with 
[02:37:00]  those little teacup hats on.  Yeah.  I don't know how they keep those hats on, by the way.  So that's the one side.  I'm like, I gotta find these motherfuckers and get a room at the mansion.  The other side is they live in a market.  Where they have a monkey that fetches them, steals them apples every night for dinner.  And now you gotta take care of them.  With the little human.  Yeah, exactly.  I gotta free them like it's Temple of Doom.  Fuck that shit.  I'm not doing that.  I would take a risk.  I would take the risk. 
[02:37:30]  Temple of Doom.  I would take the risk, though, for the payout.  Uh, uh, his biological father's going, call him, uh, trying to pull people's farts out.  Please let me die.  All right.  Good point, Joe.  Good point.  I don't, you know, man, there's so much to finding your parents in that situation, man.  It's, it's, it's, are you gonna...  I thought you were gonna hit Joe over the head.  No, no, I had...  You saw that, right?  Sorry, I was just scratching my back with my... 
[02:38:00]  Anthony just picked up the flute.  You thought he was gonna hit me?  I thought so.  You could start playing Arab music on it.  Oh, I could.  Wait a minute, here we go.  He'll come up with some.  I don't know what that is.  You just do that.  I just go, whoa.  Here's the thing, it's, it's, you know, another, another part of it for me was, is it worth, 
[02:38:30]  is it worth it?  It's not just gonna affect me, it's gonna affect everybody around me and my family.  Yeah, but it's such a mystery, I would have to know.  It's easy to say that, because I'm not adopted.  It's a different mindset, I'm sure.  But I just, where I sit, I would have to just at least know.  I think if I had...  Or look at them from afar, even, find out where they fucking live, and maybe just, you  know, stake, stake out their joints for a while.  Yeah.  Let me stalk them for a while, see if they're worth a relationship. 
[02:39:00]  I think you gotta, I mean, you don't know, you gotta...  I don't know if I'd want the relationship, because I'm sure your parents are your parents,  right, Joe?  Yeah.  And who knows?  Yeah, I mean, they're, you know, I mean, they're, that's, well, that's part of what I'm saying,  though, is that it's not just...  I'm just talking about the curiosity part, I would have to know.  I don't know if I'd want a relationship or any of that shit.  Right.  It's like, you gave up on me at nine days old?  Go fuck yourself.  I'm good.  I can see your parents, though, your birth parents are thinking the same thing.  Like, well, he could be a big executive at Apple, or he could be, you know, a stand-up 
[02:39:30]  comic or something.  Right, right.  Exactly.  Exactly.  With a drinking problem.  Well, let's face it, let's face it, people that have a lot of money don't give a kid up  for adoption.  That's true.  You know, the chances of them being rich are slim, because...  Yeah, maybe they won the lottery.  You know, there's, you know, the only, if you're rich and you give the kid up, it's  like you're partying too fucking hard.  Yeah.  And then you don't get, you don't, you don't give it for adoption, you just get it sucked 
[02:40:00]  out.  And then you're not going to care if he shows up, either.  Yeah.  Or you're like, oh, what's this kid want?  I gave him away.  Or he could be a fucking little dumb boomerang.  Leave.  Well, I used to have a bit about it where I'd say, I'd say, what am I going to do?  I'm going to, people will go, are you going to go find them?  You're going to look for your real parents.  And I go, no, I pretty much took the hint when they abandoned me.  That's very good.  But you're a filmmaker.  Yeah.  You like making little films, man.  That's your film.  And it would be hilarious to see how it turns out. 
[02:40:30]  I have an idea for a movie about it.  And I don't want to say it on the air for obvious reasons.  Yeah.  People steal.  What's the idea?  Searching for my real biological, not real.  I apologize.  Because I get the adoption thing.  Because it's part of my family now.  So I get it.  Yeah.  Your parents are your real parents.  Yeah.  The search for your biological parents.  Yeah.  But it's not a bio, the movie idea I have isn't a biological story.  It's not, or autobiographical, excuse me. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  I got you.  It's a fictional, what we call fiction in the business of film.  Do you want, I got to go to the phones.  We haven't gotten on the phones in a couple days now, by the way.  But we got to go to the phones, because two people on the phone that found their biological parents.  I've heard some horror stories.  One's a good story, and one's a bad story.  Which one do you want first?  The good one.  Let's save the bad one.  All right. 
[02:41:30]  We got Chris in Michigan.  Chris, you can relate to what Joe's saying here, huh?  Yeah, well, it wasn't me.  It was my uncle.  All right.  He was giving up for my aunt's husband.  He was giving up for adoption when he was a kid.  And he never really had any interest in finding his parents.  His dad actually found him.  It turns out dad got a girl knocked up and went off to the Army.  And her parents didn't like that he was a Native American and gave the kid up for adoption.  So a couple years ago, his dad found him. 
[02:42:00]  Dad's a member of the Pechanga tribe out there in California, one of the biggest fucking casinos out there.  And put his son, who he didn't know or anything, on the rolls.  Several years before.  So he got this giant, huge-ass payout at first.  And then every month, you know, he gets thousands and thousands and thousands.  Jesus.  What are you waiting for?  Nothing to lose.  Oh, man.  Get out there.  So basically, he's a millionaire, right?  Well, yeah.  There was never. 
[02:42:30]  Hold on, hold on.  What?  He runs back.  He flies back home here to Michigan, you know, every other week.  And flies back out there, first class, back in the morning.  First class, Joe!  There was never a better opportunity for a smash cut to things going wrong than you going,  What are you waiting for?  You have nothing to lose!  And then, yeah, bam.  There you are.  And then it cuts.  In a losing situation.  And you hear a gong noise, and it's me walking through an empty village. 
[02:43:00]  Excuse me.  A fucking marketplace with, like, chickens being beheaded.  Your biological father's missing a foot.  Because of a deal gone bad.  First of all, I'm not a fucking American Indian, first of all.  But you don't know.  That's the beauty of this.  I know.  I know.  I'm Egyptian and Italian.  But, I mean, you don't know what they became.  Might be some Egyptian thing.  Well, they didn't become American Indians with casinos.  Something.  You might get some of that pyramid money.  He might own the Lexar there in Vegas. 
[02:43:30]  Can I ask you this?  What was your uncle doing before his biological father found him?  He owned his own business.  It was mostly landscaping and stuff.  All right.  He's a landscaper.  Those guys like to say they own their own business.  Yeah.  Well, you know, he...  All right, so he went from a landscaper to landscaping to first-class fucking plane tickets,  Joe.  Nope.  It's to check out his share of the casino.  Exactly.  Listen.  Trust me when I tell you this.  Just take my word.  It is not going to work out for me like that. 
[02:44:00]  Nothing ever works out for me like that.  Yeah, but maybe this is the one thing that does.  You said a tip.  What if you're related to the Onassis or some shit like that, you know?  Well, look.  Anything's possible.  But again, would they give a kid up for adoption?  Yeah.  Unless it was something that was going to disgrace the family like...  Yeah, but what if you find out that last name is Tut?  Ah?  But Joe, you're looking at it...  Ah?  Gold in that family. 
[02:44:30]  You're looking at it not the right way.  Because they've had 30 years to make something of themselves.  You're thinking when you were nine days old.  I'm thinking...  30 some odd years.  I don't even know how old you are.  I am thinking selfishly.  I'm only concerned about dismantling my entire fucking life and destroying my parents' soul.  It's really...  It's shitty of me.  I should be more open-minded about this.  But they might be able to get a little action out of this, too.  How?  Huh?  Because Joe gets the action, then he passes it on to the parents that love them his entire life. 
[02:45:00]  What if I met him and they go, now here's a million dollars.  You don't give a fucking penny of this to those imposters.  All right.  Here's the other side of the coin that Joe's talking about.  Let's go to Billy in Ohio.  Billy.  Billy.  Hello.  How you doing?  Hey, Billy.  You're the right one now.  Because I was in trouble when I was younger.  I was adopted.  And my mom and dad seeked my real parents out.  They?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Yeah?  My real mom was a heroin addict. 
[02:45:30]  She died at, like, 42.  And my real dad's in prison doing life, so...  Oh, boy.  Yeah, I mean, you know, the odds that you're going to have a good luck story is slim to none.  So you didn't need to know that your biological...  Excuse me, I keep saying that.  Your biological mom was a heroin addict and your dad's in prison for life.  You certainly didn't need that info.  Mm-hmm.  Why is he in prison for life?  What did he do?  Murder? 
[02:46:00]  No, they hung a bitch on him.  And the last thing he did was robbing people dressed up as a cop, robbing heroin dealers  and shit like that.  Holy crap.  I mean, he had it going on.  He had a scheme anyway.  He had a plan, but...  Billy's left.  He ain't going too far.  Did you say they hung the bitch on him?  Is that what you said?  Yeah, the bitch, the habitual criminal.  I fucking love that.  I love the Midwestern terms for prison time. 
[02:46:30]  Remember in stir...  It's like it's stir-crazy when he goes,  you can kiss the baby.  Yeah.  Remember that?  Yes.  You can kiss the baby.  Oh my God, I'll punch it out.  All right.  Well, that sucks.  All right.  So there you go.  But that's...  I don't know, man.  I'm not doing it.  No?  There's no fucking way.  No real upside there.  Come on, really?  They're not just going to toss you a boatloads of money,  so then you're going to need a relationship with them.  You want to hear a horror story?  No.  About adoption?  All right.  This guy I met once, Midwestern guy, 
[02:47:00]  very, very religious family,  very, very religious family.  His mom and dad,  when they were just dating  before they got married in the 50s,  whatever the fuck it was,  or 40s, whatever,  they got pregnant.  The mom got pregnant.  It was disgraceful,  because of the time period  for a Catholic girl to be pregnant. 
[02:47:30]  Oh, yeah.  Right?  They sent the...  Did she have to go to the town?  Dude, they sent her to a nunnery.  They used to send him away.  Yeah, they sent her to a nunnery  so she could have a baby.  In secret.  They took the baby,  put it up for adoption,  and she returned home.  Years and years and years and years later,  when this guy was like in his 50s,  his older sister comes back.  The father will not recognize the daughter  as his blood.  Refuses to.  Refuses to recognize the daughter. 
[02:48:00]  And by the way,  this story came directly after a story  about how this guy was such a man of the church  that he donated like a million dollars to them  and got to go on a private tour of the Vatican  where he met the Pope.  And this fucking asshole cocksucker  won't recognize the fact that he's got a daughter.  And he's going to...  And he sits there with like a bishop,  you know, at the Vatican or whatever,  praying like some kind of holy fucking...  Whatever.  I say fuck too much.  But now I do.  I listen to the clips.  I say fuck way too much. 
[02:48:30]  I fucking say it all the fucking time.  Fuck.  You didn't.  Fuckity fuck fuck.  You just said fuck three times.  I can't think of words.  I just say fuck.  Well, we all do that.  Yep.  That's where we should be pausing and stuff.  You know what?  I didn't have a problem about it  until Burr trashed it.  And then...  Yeah.  What did he do?  He had that bit where he'd go...  Did he talk about how guys would say fucking  because they can't think of the words?  Fucking!  Yeah.  All right.  As soon as he did that,  I was like, I'm an idiot.  I like this adoption thing.  I'm going to go to Nick in New York  because there's another angle 
[02:49:00]  that's pretty interesting.  Nick.  Okay.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, Ron.  My ex-girlfriend in college,  she was adopted.  Always knew she was.  And then that time she was like 25, 26,  she was working for a local newspaper,  would go in every day and talk to her boss.  Found out later on that her boss  was her actual mother.  Ooh.  That's weird.  Good one.  I like when that happens.  That's weird.  Yeah, it was a whole...  It was funny.  Ooh, that is weird.  They looked alike and everything. 
[02:49:30]  So one day they were just talking  and the story compared that  she had a C-section,  that the days all lined up.  In fact, in 2020,  readers digested a whole story on them.  I like when that kind of thing happens  where you find out like your neighbor  that babysat you all along was your dad.  I know.  So we're not going to find your biological parents?  No, I'm not doing it, man.  I don't need to do it.  I got enough fucking things in my life going on right now. 
[02:50:00]  I don't need any other goddamn grief over this.  Do you know how stressful...  Forget about the actual meeting the parents part of it.  Can you imagine how stressful  just the journey up to that point is?  Oh, man.  It's just got to be brutal, dude.  Maybe, Joe, they didn't feel worthy.  They wanted to give you a better life.  That's what he holds on to.  Hence no abandonment issues, sir.  That's what he's got to hold on to.  Maybe your parents really just wanted to give you  a much better chance. 
[02:50:30]  I think that's what they were doing.  There you go.  So why the abandonment issue?  Oh, I don't know.  That's just...  It's one of those...  Dude, I don't know where that comes from.  I mean, I can theorize on where it comes from, but...  Maybe your adopted parents used to whisper shit in your ear  when you were misbehaving.  We're going to send you back.  We're going to send you back.  Right.  You know, I think it's just a thing,  like a genetic thing, you know.  Genetics are a lot...  Genetics are a lot stronger than most people give them credit for 
[02:51:00]  in this day and age.  You know, a lot of people want to ignore genetics  and ignore also the nurture along with the nature  and all that sort of thing.  They just want to ignore it.  And like going through an experience like that  at a very young age, I think,  can have a lifelong effect on you.  And it needs to be dealt with.  Do you have traits of your adopted parents?  Like, do you have their sense of humor?  Or do you have, like, I don't know, their anger? 
[02:51:30]  Or I don't know.  We have a lot of similar traits.  Isn't that weird?  Because you're not biological.  And there are people that tell me I look like them.  See, that's weird.  Yeah.  The traits you could kind of see.  Yeah, but they just picked out a kid  that they felt looked like them.  It's kind of like...  It's not how it works.  It's kind of like when you see people walking around with dogs  and they look like they're dogs.  Right.  It's the same shit.  Yeah, it's...  There aren't...  It's the same shit.  There aren't cages at Oak.  You don't get to just walk and point at a kid  and go, that's not one, looks good.  Oh, I thought that's how adoption worked,  like a pet store. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  So did I.  I thought there was, like, little vats with babies in them.  You weren't in an orphanage  and they came walking through to save...  Orphanage.  Orphanage.  Wearing one of those dress...  Those dresses, the long rings that you sleep in  and with the little cap  that comes off your head with a pom-pom on the end.  And they only save one kid.  Yeah, what happened was, was the evil...  What a twisted way to do it.  The evil landowner was going to shut down the orphanage  if they didn't come up with the rent.  And my parents concocted a scheme. 
[02:52:30]  Spanky, when my back pension comes in,  you'll get your monkey.  Yeah.  No, so, I mean, it's, you know, it's, it's, uh, look,  there's, there's, there's just things that come along with it.  I don't look, I don't want to...  All right, we can go on.  You know, but, uh...  I just find it fascinating, that's all.  Yeah.  Because I got some adoption, um, stuff in my family now.  It's very hard...  And I find it very interesting, that's all.  Very hard to adopt.  Not cheap.  I mean, I think when my parents did it, it was...  Well, a nice wife kid. 
[02:53:00]  It's true.  I hear you go to Texas.  I mean, if you, now, if you want, like...  If you want a special needs child.  If you want an Asian or that kind of thing, that's...  Well, of course.  I've always equated that, like, like, if the, if the, if the adoption agency was a Sam Goody,  the Asian kids would be in the, that $3 bargain.  Oh, you think?  Because they're just, like, getting rid of them?  I don't know what's going on over there.  There's so many.  It's an overstock of Asian kids.  That's because once you adopt one, like, uh, one day lady, you want to adopt more. 
[02:53:30]  All right.  You want to know how I feel about that?  Because on the Upper West Side, you got some of these ladies that adopt, right?  Ladies!  And you see them where they have the Asian kid, and I immediately think, and this is  going to be horrible, cheap and lazy.  Oh, wow.  They got cheap and lazy with their adoption.  It does seem like it's easy to go that route, the Asian route, isn't it?  You kind of give in, instead of going, you know what, I want a kid that's more, more  like me, meaning, you know, I'm white or whatever. 
[02:54:00]  Here's why.  That comes from a culture around the world that really just casts off children if they're  not the type of child that that family wants, especially girls, you know, if they want boys  and stuff.  So there's a lot of them available.  It's not like they're just giving away, you know, white American kids.  I would dare to say, uh, uh, they do not have the, uh, adoration for children in Asia  that we have in this country.  Nah.  When you see a homeless lady in China, uh, and her kid is missing eyes, and you go, I'm 
[02:54:30]  going to give them money, and then the guy that's taking you around China says, don't  do that.  She poked her kid's eyes out on purpose to make you feel sorry for her.  That's what people do around here.  All right.  Okay.  This is a different, well, a Chinese guy told me, and he lived there.  So that's all I know.  By the way, there's nothing wrong with adopting an Asian child.  I just want to say that.  No, of course there's not.  Of course not.  Who was even fucking getting that idea? 
[02:55:00]  But I'm saying if you want to get this fucking nice Italian-Egyptian mixture at Sam Gooding,  I'm on the rack where you're going, 1999, are you fucking kidding me?  I just feel like during the process, you just decided, all right, enough, I'll just take an  Asian child.  Yeah.  It seems like the, you know, getting the white kid is a little too difficult and a little  It is.  A little too time-consuming, so I'll go with the Asian.  It's not waiting for the car that you want to order.  You just take the one off the floor.  It's like, well, I would have liked it in red, but I'll take the white car. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  I think parents that adopt, I think they're terrific people.  I really do.  We're making some jokes, though.  Oh, they're outraged now.  Who is?  The people.  I can just feel it.  Good.  I can feel it.  Good.  It's not my fault you fucking went cheap and got an Asian.  No, I'm kidding.  I'm just kidding.  I'm just joking.  Went to the dollar store?  What the fuck?  Yeah, look, I'm no, I put myself above that a minute.  I'm in the bargain bin, too.  I'm fucking half Arab.  I'm just fucking around. 
[02:56:00]  No, I'm saying it myself.  I hear Texas is the place to go now.  For Arab kids?  No, just to adopt in general.  That's like the hub.  That's the hub for adoption.  Fucking wasteland down there.  People will call.  They'll back me up on this.  For some reason, Texas has become the place.  The hub.  Yeah, if you're one of fucking hills have eyes, nuclear baby.  Why?  It lives in a mountain.  Out in that fucking desert.  I don't know.  I just thought of that.  I thought it was funny, and it wasn't that funny.  I would take a Texas kid. 
[02:56:30]  I would take a Texas kid.  Well, yeah.  Why wouldn't you?  They come from good stock.  Do they?  I don't know.  I don't know shit.  You know what?  All right.  I'll tell you this.  Is it guarding a lot of kids?  I would adopt, actually.  I don't think you would.  From where?  I swear to God, I would adopt.  Because I'm...  What would you go for?  I don't know.  If my wife wants to go through a bunch more pregnancies.  What would you go for?  It's expensive, dude.  White kid, or would you go specialty item?  You'd have a couple of white kids already. 
[02:57:00]  No, I would...  That's why I was making dumb jokes.  I probably would go...  African baby?  Well...  African baby?  You would disown me.  No, I like African babies.  But man, they look like models, though, man.  They look like fucking models.  Who?  African babies?  I would adopt a black kid.  They all start out looking like models.  You've got to pick out the right ones.  I'd go with a mix.  Yeah.  I think it'd be cute to have a little Asian kid.  No, I'm being dead serious, though.  Without the jokes, I would adopt. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would throw an adopted kid into the mix.  Well, here's the thing.  Why not?  Why...  If I get a big house, why not?  Why wouldn't you?  What?  That's what...  Like, that's the...  Not you, specifically.  I mean, you wouldn't, because you're selfish.  But the...  I'm not.  But I'm not selfish.  That's hilarious.  I play a good role on the show, but...  Oh, my God.  I've got to defend myself a little bit.  I'm just joking.  I'm not a monster like you think, Joe.  Go ahead.  Theoretically.  Blowing up your joke. 
[02:58:00]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Theoretically.  Why wouldn't you adopt...  I mean this generally, the you.  It's like there are literally thousands to millions of children that need it, number one.  Number two, you don't kind of go through all the...  Like you just said with your wife, going through the body stuff.  You don't have to go through the misery of putting your body...  It's tough, man.  It's tough.  And there is something beautiful about the entire process of conception to childbirth, obviously.  Especially the conception part of you. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  There's Josh when we need him.  Yeah.  It's fucking...  Ah!  Fun-loving Josh.  Yeah, so it's like...  But, you know, it's like...  But it's so easy.  I mean, it's not easy.  It's finance.  It's a lot of money.  That's probably why.  But it's like, why not just go adopt a kid?  And I never understood...  Probably because I'm adopted.  I never understood that whole, but it's not mine thing.  Oh, no, man.  I would have adopted a second. 
[02:59:00]  I never got that.  And I've never thought...  Ever since I was a kid, I never believed in that blood is thicker than water horse shit.  It is, though.  Oh, I was talking chemically.  Hence where that comes from.  See?  It's absolutely correct, Joe.  Yes!  You're right.  I'm sorry.  I was talking chemically, too.  I don't know why I said that.  Yeah, no, I just never...  I never bought it.  I was always like, if you're a fucking douche, you're a douche.  And if you're not, you're not.  I don't give a shit if we're related.  You're one of those guys that doesn't want to have kids, right? 
[02:59:30]  I have...  You know what's funny?  Until we just started talking about Asian kids, I didn't want kids.  And then I started thinking about having a little Asian baby, and I liked it.  It was making me happy to think about that.  Oh, yeah, man.  Asian kids are cute, man.  Raise someone that can do your taxes eventually?  I'm going to time it perfectly.  I'm going to time it perfectly.  Where I'll adopt a kid, and then it'll be just in time for them to have to take care  of my fucking floundering ass.  There you go.  I'm going to...  That way I avoid all the child shit now. 
[03:00:00]  But you would be perfect...  And the wife and...  You'd be perfect for like a Soon-Yi situation.  Oh, I need someone that's like...  Where it starts out as a kid, and then you marry it.  How great would that be?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I have intimacy issues as it is.  It's like, I don't want to bring two other people into my life now that I have to figure  this out with.  I'm still trying to figure out how to communicate health in a healthy way with my regular family.  You know what I mean? 
[03:00:30]  Like, I'm still trying to figure that out, and like...  That means they do some shit.  Yes, you're going to throw someone else into the mix, like, that you don't even know that  probably sucks, and try to have a relationship with them.  Yeah, well, everybody thinks you're going to have this fucking Field of Dreams moment.  What a play catch.  Two fucking old people standing in a yard.  That would be hilarious.  You, and you're throwing a...  Oh, Dad.  You're throwing a baseball around.  Ew, how gross is that?  Yeah.  You're trying to say that.  It's not going to be Ray Liotta.  No.  It's not going to look like Ray Liotta. 
[03:01:00]  You're trying to say it doesn't work out that way, usually?  Never.  No.  It's not going to look like Ray Liotta.  It's going to look like Sala from Raiders of the Lost Ark.  Ugh.  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  Bad dates.  Bad dates.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show's Best of O&A.  We'll be right back.  Don't go anywhere.  Hi, I'm Maria Bartiromo.

[03:05:30]  You know what the waitress just said to me in North Carolina?  What?  Oh, no.  They said, thank God.  Thank God you have a mixed crowd.  Meaning white people came.  Because they fucking hate black shows.  Wow.  So they saw some white people there.  They were like, thank God.  We're going to make some money.  Oh, we're going to make a few bucks.  And then they went to say, look, it's not even the guys.  Because guys, we're just easy going. 
[03:06:00]  Guys don't fucking just want life to be good.  It's the women.  All women.  But black women get with it.  I asked for 17 french fries.  You only brought me 13.  You'd be like, oh, come on, bitch.  I got bad service.  I'm not tipping.  I got to ask you a really dumb question.  Do black guys drink like white guys at comedy shows?  You get the white guys at the comedy shows.  They're drinking.  No, nobody drinks like white people do.  White people are fucking.  There is a difference, right?  Yeah.  Black guys don't sip. 
[03:06:30]  White people guzzle.  There is a difference, right?  Yeah.  I mean, the white people.  So if the comedy club sees a lot of white guys coming in, they know they're going to make some cash off the bar.  But black people drink.  When they go out, they spend a lot on food.  What kind of drinking does a black guy do at a comedy club?  Drinks a lot of Heineken and drinks a lot of Hennessy and Coke.  Do you know what I mean?  And the women drink a lot of girly drinks.  So the women ultimately drink a little more than the guys.  But guys drink a lot.  And they drink top shelf. 
[03:07:00]  When black people go out, they try to treat themselves very nice.  White people drink shots and they get drunk.  You know what I'm saying?  Black people do get drunk, but we become drunk.  White people are like immediately to go somewhere, they got to be drunk.  White people are drunk.  Let's be honest.  It's just a different culture with drinking.  It's just.  We got to deal with the crime.  It's not.  You know what it is?  It's only so one way to get through it all.  It's even more depressing that black people act that way sober.  Drinking away your sorrows.  We don't have as much fun doing things.  Like we don't have fun drinking. 
[03:07:30]  And it's drinking is a process.  Yeah.  And white people are a lot of fun.  White people are a lot of fun.  That's the one thing I tell black people.  White people are a lot of fun.  White people do a lot.  Sexually, a lot of fun.  Black people love fucking.  But it's not.  It's fucking.  It's like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You watch.  It's like, you know, I got I got buddies, you know, white buddies.  Oh, dude, I put a baseball bat in her asshole.  It's like, what?  But it's like funny.  And they'll send you a picture and go, look at the culprit in the corner.  The girl's smiling. 
[03:08:00]  But he really showing me the baseball bat and the bitch that he shoved her.  And it's fun.  But, you know, black women, they love fucking.  But it ain't.  It's not a lot of baseball bats.  There's got to be a little respect.  Not a lot of peeing.  Oh, yeah.  There's respect.  A lot of fun.  A lot of fun.  No smacking.  No choking and shit.  You know, it's like it's like that.  You ain't spanking her hiney.  I saw a porn on the bitch was like, don't be trying to throw me around.  Oh, really?  Can you spank a black girl's hiney?  You can if you're just being forceful. 
[03:08:30]  If you're like, bam, she don't do that.  Like, there was a time I used to do a lot of, you know, when I was really getting demon.  I used to, once you figure out certain things, you learn how to, you know, you get into the  little spit thing.  You know what I mean?  I just like girls that, something about girls doing things they ain't supposed to be doing  really sexy.  So, you know, I used to just go spit on my face, you know, and no, I can't.  I said, do it.  Go ahead.  Do it.  So then I would, I just spit on their face, but right on the cheek, on the cheek, and then 
[03:09:00]  I'll just lick it off.  And once that happened, you can feel her filth coming along.  Her filth is coming alive.  You can feel that she's just like, oh my God, what just happened?  Now she's, now she's just, once girls get opened up to that filthy thing, it's just,  it's, it's, that is such a beautiful fucking thing.  What's the matter, Jimmy?  You don't like that?  Not the licking it off part.  But that's just the, it helps them with the dignity part.  Yeah, Patrice just grossed out Jimmy for the first time.  That little guy, though, picture a guy spitting someone's face. 
[03:09:30]  You said the girl spitting your face didn't bother me.  Right.  But a guy spitting someone's face.  Hey.  All right.  So, I wouldn't like that.  Blacks don't drink because they end up shooting each other.  Oh.  Nah, we shoot each other sober, dude.  That's at the block party.  That's clarity.  That's at a block party.  Shooting is a weed thing.  Oh, fuck.  Chris Houston, I knew we'd get to this point.  Go ahead, Chris.  Jesus.  Hey, Patrice is full of crap.  The blacks don't, the blacks dip on the drinks because they don't want to buy extra drinks,  man.  You sound rich.  Like, stop. 
[03:10:00]  Like, it's a cultural thing.  It's not a money thing.  It's just we don't guzzle drinks because we don't drink to get drunk.  It's social.  It's just a social thing.  White people drink to get, some white people drink to get drunk.  You never see black people playing the game where there's a fucking funnel and a hole in a bitch's mouth.  Like, it doesn't happen.  That's why I asked you the question.  Drink, drink, drink.  It'll be one nigga in there doing it.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, one nigga with a lot of white friends. 
[03:10:30]  But you don't see a bunch of niggas sitting around.  They pour Carvasse, they pour Hennessy, they get tipsy, and then you go, oh, shit, this nigga's drunk.  Yeah, but they don't have to drink as much.  And white girls stumble until they die, and black girls get horny when they drink a little bit.  Black guys drink harder shit, right?  Yes, we don't have fun with drinking.  You're not going out and drinking 18 beers.  Yeah, or trying to guzzle a tequila.  Liquor, it's a different culture. 
[03:11:00]  You sip it and enjoy it a little bit.  Kegs and the whole thing.  You never did a keg party.  No.  That's such a white party.  When I do my cookouts, the liquor I have, because, you know, I got mixed kraut.  I wouldn't know.  I buy the gym.  Thanks.  Oh, man, you never got invited?  Come on.  Maybe once, he's sort of invited.  I think he invited you.  Sort of, I think.  I got a sort of invite.  You coming?  Yeah, I got one of those.  You coming?  I would go to one of your parties.  I'm going to invite you next time.  Cool.  I would like to check that out.  I invite you.  I just don't believe it. 
[03:11:30]  I know you're weird about it.  I would go, though.  I just don't believe it.  I don't believe it, but I'm going to.  I'm going to do it next time.  I'm going to surprise you.  And here's what I like about Ant.  You coming in?  No.  No.  I'm busy that day.  Why?  Well, you know, but I make sure for my white customers, I have Jim Bean.  Jim Bean?  For white people?  Here's something that's been in my house.  White people?  Yeah, I got it.  This is what I know.  There's a lot of white. 
[03:12:00]  Here's why.  What do you think I drink?  You did the drug thing earlier.  Wait, let me.  Go around the room.  What do you think we all drink as white boys?  I want to tell you what no one drinks is Bombay Gin.  It's no one drinks Bombay Gin.  No one drinks Bombay Gin.  They drink Bombay Sapphire Gin.  That's the difference.  Ah, shit.  I think I have Sapphire because I asked the guy with the top.  I have Bombay Sapphire Gin.  It's been there five years. 
[03:12:30]  No one fucks with it.  No one has touched it.  Okay, vodka, black people and white people love vodka.  Yeah.  Oh yeah, that's an easy one.  Black people love vodka, cranberry vodka and soda and white people like vodka straight  or a little orange.  Vodka straight?  Yeah, that's what I saw.  Really?  Black people love Kvassi, any cognac.  White people do the Jim Beam, a little whiskey.  And for beer, I get dark beer for a white deuce, like a red stripe maybe. 
[03:13:00]  Or a, and Corona for white people.  If I didn't make a choice, two beers.  Corona for white people.  You got me.  Heineken for black people.  You got me.  That's...  That would be easy, right?  That's my...  Heineken.  And then a whole bunch of...  I didn't know the Heineken's and the black thing.  ...little, uh, the drinks, the, uh, the coolers things.  Right, wine coolers.  Yeah.  Not wine, but you know, the fucking...  Kind of like, uh...  Smirnoff's and...  Like the hard iced tea and all that.  That, that goes.  Smirnoff ice.  But the girlies drink those.  You're like Louis XIII. 
[03:13:30]  What's that?  Is that Kanye?  Louis Trey.  I don't drink.  I just...  No, I mean...  I, I, I buy, I buy Hennessy.  Yeah, Louis Trey would be huge.  I buy, uh, Pambassier.  I might, I might give them my Louis Trey.  In the community.  That's too much money.  That's like $400 for that bottle.  Isn't that like really expensive a shot?  Yeah, we got that from, uh...  Oh, tequila.  Sorry.  Uh, I bought $1,800 one time.  Oh, yeah.  Which is the dumbest...  I tried to do that cat thing.  It's the stupidest...  What's that?  The $1,800 tequila. 
[03:14:00]  It's just dumb.  It's crazy.  It's just dumb.  Because it, it, you can't pour it in the cat.  No.  It's impossible to do the cat thing.  I don't, I don't...  The thing with the cat, he goes...  Here's the, this is the fucking thing.  Man, I'm confused.  What is this?  I don't know.  This is the thing.  It's, it's, it's...  You know, the big tequila is, uh, uh...  What's the biggie?  Uh, Cuervo.  The major one.  Cuervo.  Cuervo.  Not Cuervo.  Patron.  That's the one.  Niggas gotta have Patron.  So, Patron, and then the one under that, it's a fucking $1,800. 
[03:14:30]  And you put this $1,800 shit, and it's supposed to be, hey, what can, what can your cap do?  Like, the thing is, my cap can make a shot.  Your cap is just fucking a cork.  Like, whatever.  And it don't even work.  Yeah.  You gotta do it the right way.  It's horse manure.  No, I don't get it.  It's not, it's a commercial.  You don't see the commercial?  You just pour the bottle upside down, pretty much, and it fills the, it fills the cap.  But, Ronnie, take the fucking...  You gotta do it real quick.  You gotta do it.  Oh, it's a whole thing?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I got you.  Oh, I don't, I didn't know this. 
[03:15:00]  But Anthony is a...  Look, are you alright, buddy?  This nigga is, this nigga's not like a, a junkie.  We almost, we almost...  I'm so excited.  He's so tired.  This nigga.  I'm like, ha, ha.  This nigga can't...  I can't even tell you, man.  What, you have, you have a late night?  No, I actually didn't.  I had such a busy weekend.  Oh, fuck that.  I was nodding like a junkie.  Jesus.  I was driving and, like, friggin' all weekend.  I didn't want to get home, man.  I don't know.  It's gonna be tough.  That escalade could careen off of some walls.  You better ask somebody to drive you home. 
[03:15:30]  Watch me.  Take a cab, dude.  I didn't even notice he was nodding.  Are you going back in line?  I did watch.  You know I could tell?  He didn't close his eyes.  I should've...  One eye just got bigger.  No, I should've...  I should've known because Zan stretches when he's tired.  Yeah, yeah.  Remember he did the stretch thing?  I've been stretching like crazy.  Yeah, usually...  That's his tell.  It's the Monday morning fuckin' stretching thing.  That's Anthony's tell.  He's tired.  Zan's got TV tonight.  I know, but I gotta go home, too.  Why?  First, to work out.  Oh, okay.  And then I gotta come back into the city.  So there's a lot of drivin'. 
[03:16:00]  I'm gonna have to nap.  That's a lot of fuckin' money, dude.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Remy Martin.  How much is that?  I've never even heard of this one.  Louis XIV.  Well, this is a 13.  Black Pearl.  But is that back from actual Louis XIV time?  Dude, I don't know.  No, no.  I've never heard of this shit.  The price is 100 grand.  We got a bottle of Louis XIII from...  Which comedy club took care of us?  I don't remember now.  That's the cognac we have.  Caroline's always takes care of us.  1,700 bucks.  If I bought a $100,000 liquor, you know what I would...  I would just stick my finger and everybody lick.  Lick my finger. 
[03:16:30]  There you go.  I wash my hand.  Here, you take a lick.  I got a question for the cognac people.  My Louis XIII, I've had for 10, 12 years because I don't drink this shit.  And it's gone through some temperature changes.  Does that fuck it up?  I don't think so.  It's been in really hot basements.  You got a $2,000 bottle of liquor?  Easy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The bottle looks all classy.  They say the empty bottle is worth like $500.  Something like that.  Mine isn't open.  Have you drunk it?  No.  No.  It's unopened.  I might give it to you for your friends. 
[03:17:00]  I don't give a shit.  Oh, shit.  I don't need the money.  Here's how much I don't drink.  I'll fucking just pour...  Just to try something.  And I would only invite people who understood that this is Louis XIII.  That is real good shit.  I bet you if I poured shots for all of us, none of us would know why.  If I catch a nigga putting Diet Coke in the Louis XIII, I'll smack the shit out of you.  He's mixing it up.  Did you just put cooler ice?  I guarantee we pour shots.  Now, one of us in this room would be able to say why it's tasty and good.  I probably would hate it.  Yeah, it's like over $100. 
[03:17:30]  A lot of these restaurants cost $100.  $100 a shot for that shit.  $100 a shot for Louis XIII.  How good could it be?  That's what I'm saying.  I bet you we sip that shit.  What was your drink of choice when you was doing your thing?  I was broke.  Some.  No, it's a gargler of choice.  That and Lavoris.  No, I would drink any type of beer.  A lot of grain alcohol because it was very cheap.  We would have $5 to drink.  You had no money, so you had to buy the stuff.  Fuck yeah, moonshine.  That's what it was, yeah.  But I didn't like it.  It was terrible, but it got you loaded.  You're a tequila guy. 
[03:18:00]  No, no, I hate tequila.  I'm a Captain and Coke, Jack and Coke.  Oh, fucking.  Shit like that.  Fucking whiskey.  Yeah, yeah.  All right.  Or Captain Morgan, you know, spiced rum.  That's great with Coke.  Although over the weekend, I would have vodka and cranberry.  I like that shit.  I have a lot of wine.  Wine goes too.  Wine.  I got a lot of wine.  And you're a wine guy?  Yeah, I like wine.  You're not a hard liquor guy.  No, I'm not really.  What's your hard liquor if you decided to?  I stopped really drinking heavily when I hit 30. 
[03:18:30]  When you were drinking heavily?  30 was the cutoff for me.  What did you stop drinking?  I just drank a lot.  A lot of beer.  Anything?  Oh, I was a shot guy.  You know.  I did it under the cage of being at your house.  I did have a fucking...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had a stout.  I had to.  Yeah, Guinness.  I had to bob down.  You were hysterical.  I had to bob down.  You had one.  You're just sitting in that chair like, yep.  Jägermeister, all that shit.  Enjoyable.  It was very enjoyable.  It was very enjoyable.  I haven't been back since, though.  Let's all get drunk. 
[03:19:00]  I think I'm going to have a party on, like, a Labor Day weekend party.  I might call it off and come.  It's going to be like a...  Yeah.  I mean, I might call off my thing and I don't know.  Your second party's going to be when we're not away.  A two-day one.  Well, it's Labor Day.  I'm out.  Got to have something.  I'll be there.  But I'm going to do, like, Saturday and Sunday.  Like, two days straight.  Can you be selective?  You just let anybody crawl in.  No, no.  I can be pretty selective at times.  Only when I can deal with them.  I might be able to deal with Patrick Minaki, but I'm not going to fucking... 
[03:19:30]  Big A?  I'm going to push him in his pool.  I'm going to push him in your pool to watch yourself.  Oh, it's sizzling.  Wait till you meet the new one, Ira.  You've got to get Ira to your house.  No, I don't think Ira's going to be coming over my house.  Ira.  Hey, let's go to Joe.  I've got to know about my cognac really fast.  You know what's great, though, before Joe, real fast?  Yeah.  Patrice telling me that I was nodding was like the car weaving and almost hitting something.  You wake up and go, holy shit.  Because now I'm like, now I'm awake.  You were gone, dude.  Patrice is the wall that I almost hit.  Was he nodding? 
[03:20:00]  I saw it.  I saw it.  One eye kind of went like, what the fuck was that?  I'm going to miss that.  And his mouth was getting ready to...  Yeah.  And you're not a one-word answer guy, either.  No.  You just went...  Unless you say, who's the problem in this country?  That's still two words.  In person.  In person.  In person.  In person.  In person.  In person.  The problem?  Joe, tell me about my cognac.  Oh, that contact, man.  I mean, Louie Trey is... 
[03:20:30]  They put about 1% out of a barrel that was aged, you know, like a couple hundred years ago.  The rest of it's like 10, 20, 30 years after that.  And then it's in a Waterford crystal container.  Now, I've worked in the strip clubs and fine restaurants all over the country, and the common  rule amongst everybody, if you buy the last shot, you get the bottle.  You take it home.  So if you see something that's down to fucking last drop, say, I'll take that last drop, but 
[03:21:00]  give me the bottle.  And they should do it at their quality place, but, you know...  Well, I've seen it at $100, $110 a shot.  Is it worth it?  I don't know.  No way.  No, I...  Literally, honestly, yeah.  You know what?  I'm right with you, Ann, because I've sold bottles of wine for 45 grand.  Wow.  And is it fucking worth it?  You know?  Yeah, it is.  If you're making a billion dollars a year, if you just...  You know, if you're the owner of Walmart, and you just made $200,000 by the time you  finished dinner, you know, it's all relevant. 
[03:21:30]  I had a...  I had two $2,000 bottles of wine.  I obviously didn't buy them.  I'll beat you to the punch.  It was a guy that owned an island off Cape Cod, and he was breaking out this dish.  I told the story a few times where the cork is basically falling out of the bottles,  like 1967 or something like that.  It's not even that old.  The label's, like, falling off this damn thing, and, man, was it good?  Abso-fucking-lutely.  Was it $2,000 good?  I don't know. 
[03:22:00]  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  I don't know.  I knew I was drinking some good shit, though.  Absolutely.  Because I drank enough wine to know, but, you know.  Wine, as long as they take care of...  Wine is living.  Now, when you're talking about the Louis Trey being hot, don't worry about it.  It's distilled.  Any distilled product, it can go up and down in temperature.  It doesn't matter.  It's not...  You know, I might give it to Patrice for your friends.  Yeah, Patrice says he has a...  If you're pouring cognac, then you take this bottle off my hands.  I don't know what to do with it. 
[03:22:30]  I'm going to really do an injustice to this bottle.  You ever see his friends fucking will have some salmon and do a shot?  I saw a par over a bitch's head.  Hey, asshole!  What's a piece of...  Fingerfuck yourself.  This is Louis XIII.  Fingerfuck yourself.  You know what to do with that bottle?  When that motherfucker's empty?  Fucking refill it with Hennessy VF.  And no one will know, right?  Ain't nobody will know.  That's what I'm thinking.  Maybe you can do that, too.  I'm filling it with fruit punch.  It's raining, bitch.  Ice tea. 
[03:23:00]  Pour it all over your body, and then see what everybody fucking says.  Goddamn, that motherfucker's pouring.  Danny, what's Louis XIII going...  All right, enough.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  You're obsessed.  Thank you.  He's fucking happy.  He is screaming up there.  What's a basic bottle of Louis XIII going for right now?  Average price is looking like $1,700.  No.  Really?  Then the price has gone way the fuck up since we got our bottle in.  Yeah.  I was offered $1,000 at a liquor store for it once.  Wow, really?  Because I was just casually talking to the guy.  He goes, I'll fucking buy that bottle right now for $1,000.  I remember that.  A grand? 
[03:23:30]  That's all the time.  I don't know where the fucking guy is anymore.  That's a bargain?  Somewhere out on Long Island.  What?  That's a bargain?  I guess.  He thought he could make money off it at the time.  So now you're telling me it's pushing almost $2,000 for this bottle?  With the...  What is that?  Wow.  I got that one right there with the box, the red box.  Yep.  Right there.  Yeah, that's mine.  Well, this is a small one.  That's the 50.  That's a very small bottle.  But I think what you have is probably the 750.  Maybe mine is the small.  No, no, no.  I don't think so.  So is the box.  It's that one right there with the box. 
[03:24:00]  Dash, bitch, for this Louis XIII.  $2,000, motherfucker.  $2,000 fucking dollars.  Come on.  You want it?  Crawl.  Crawl.  How much is that?  $17,000.  Almost $2,000.  I'm opening it up.  I'm like, all right hoes.  Yeah.  Bring on the bitches.  They wouldn't even know.  No, they wouldn't know.  There's probably not that many bitches that would even know.  Meanwhile, it's Louis the CK.  It's just cum.  Yeah. 
[03:24:30]  Just cum with freckles on it.  That's what gives it the color.  Fucking freckles.  Are you serious?  Really?  So this is...  It was given to us years ago.  It was very nice.  Oh, man.  A long time ago.  I wanted to say it was Rascals before it closed.  It might have been.  No, right?  No.  No.  I think it might have been, though.  Do you still have that bottle of the Sam Adams triple Bach fucking...  Oh, yeah.  I get that, too, still.  Shit.  What's that?  What is this rich shit?  That's another thing that Jim Cook gave us. 
[03:25:00]  It was a special thing.  He only made like a thousand bottles, gave me an ant one.  A beer?  It was numbered.  Yeah.  It's a weird beer.  It's like...  A shot of that shit will kill you.  It's like cognac.  Yeah.  It's like a fucking...  How big's the bottle?  Heavy duty.  It's like a...  It's illegal to sell in a lot of states because it's just too much alcohol.  That's right.  I forgot all about this.  It might be utopia.  Is that...  No.  If I saw the bottle, I would know.  It didn't look like that.  Eight hundred?  Well, look at the prices online for this.  Triple Bach. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  It was some kind of triple Bach.  Triple Bach.  That's it.  That's the bop.  That's it right there.  Nine dollars and ninety-five cents.  Oh, great.  Thanks, Jim.  Thanks, Jim Cook.  You're bragging about a ten dollar beer?  I'm so fucking happy, you pieces of shit.  The next story was, yeah, Fidel Castro flew in and made us a golf ball.  Ed, you know that's it.  I've been saving this bottle like it's the most valuable thing I've ever had.  No way.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Hang on.  It's nine...  It's nine euros.  Which makes it twenty dollars.  So it's a twenty dollar bottle. 
[03:26:00]  No.  Come on.  Oh, you fucking...  Dude, mine's in a glass case like it's the Mona Lisa.  Is that fucking thing like signed and shit?  Well, ours was signed, though.  So throw a couple bucks off.  Come on.  Take a couple bucks off because it's damaged.  Find another one.  How happy are you guys?  Find another one that looks like that bottle, Danny.  Put that shit in your cock.  Come on.  Do cereal, nigga.  Just eat that.  I'm going to go home and I'll tweet.  Millennium.  It was the Millennium.  All right.  What's the Millennium about?  That's $8.95. 
[03:26:30]  Sam Adams' Millennium.  What's the Millennium about?  That's the one that I know as being like the super expensive.  That's the one.  Where's the Millennium?  It's this stuff, the utopiness.  No, it's not it.  It was in that other bottle.  You guys are so happy.  Put in Sam Adams' Millennium.  I didn't even know.  But the bottle doesn't look like that, Danny.  It looked like the other one.  I'm telling you.  I'll bring it in tomorrow.  I know it looks like that.  You really thought that was worth something?  That's $6 beer?  I know it's good.  I wish this was Antique Roadshow.  Oh, would you be surprised if I told you this was $20? 
[03:27:00]  Dude, I'm telling you, that is the exact fucking bottle.  Three bottles, 40 bones, dude.  My great-great-grandfather gave me this beer.  Well, this shit is...  I am going to throw that fucking thing out in the street.  It's not only spoiled, but it's $10.  I'm going to shake it up and just fucking dump it in my pool.  How great is that?  I've been sitting in this thing like it's the most valuable thing I know.  And then showing the movers to be careful with it.  Oh, yeah, all that shit.  Vintage 1997 is fucking $40.  And that's for three bottles.  That's three bottles.  You know when you move, you always have a box of shit you don't trust anyone with? 
[03:27:30]  Yeah, I'll be taking that triple bucket.  That's definitely in that box every time.  Put the triple bucket in the car.  Don't put it in the truck.  Right.  Oh, fuck.  What a waste of time.  I'm so happy.  How funny is that?  We were bragging like, wait till you see how much this is.  Hey, guys.  Let me open the treasure chest and show you what I got.  $40 for three.  Oh, we just got the Miller Lite, top-of-the-line beer.  We just got Coors, the Coors Special Edition.  You know what?  Fuck you, truck.  He gave you three beers. 
[03:28:00]  Fuck him.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, man.  He made it sound like, he even said, remember, he said that there's only a thousand of these  or something like that.  That's bullshit.  What a motherfucker.  Oh, that's classic.  That's fuck.  We got the Budweiser, Conan the Barbarian edition.  It comes with a sword.  It's worth a zillion.  I was scared to bring it over fucking state lines, because he said the beer's illegal  in, I don't know, what, ten states or something.  Okay, it's overproofed.  Yeah.  Sam Adam lied like the real Sam Adam.  I'm bringing that shit in tomorrow. 
[03:28:30]  That guy's a liar.  I'll bring that shit in tomorrow.  What's the matter of mother beers we got?  And I'm not giving you my Louis XIII, because you're not going to treat it properly.  I'm taking my gift back.  People are going to drink it.  They're going to drink it?  I'm going to let people drink it.  Yeah.  Special occasions, though.  Really special.  All right.  But I want to make sure people know.  Everything you've done for me, Patrice, I'm giving you my fucking bottle.  Thank you.  I don't need it.  What am I going to do with it?  I'm going to Google it, print it out, what it is, and then send it out to anybody coming  to the house to know what the fuck Louis XIII did. 
[03:29:00]  See what excitement you get back.  See if there's any kind of buzz on it.  All right?  I am so angry.  Was it Utopia?  No.  It was Millennium.  It was Millennium.  It was Millennium.  It was Utopia's $350 a bottle.  No, no.  It was the most expensive Sam Adams.  I'm just saying this.  No, it's that bottle, Patrice.  I'm telling you.  A college professor paid $4,910 for Sam Adams' Millennium Beer at an auction for bottle number 
[03:29:30]  one.  What bottle do we have?  Because he signed ours.  $3,000.  I remember $4,000.  $3,001.  Sam Adams' Millennium.  That's the one that's expensive.  Yeah, but that's not what we have.  We don't have that, though.  That's not the bottle.  That's not the bottle.  I'm positive.  Maybe he changed the bottle.  Maybe.  They changed car, you know, design.  It's that right there, to the right.  God damn it.  No.  That's shit.  It's not it either. 
[03:30:00]  Fuck.  He gave you $10 beer.  But you know what?  $10 beer is special.  Oh, shit.  As opposed to $1.  $1.99.  I think we're even.  He gave us a $10 bottle of beer.  A six-pack is $2.99.  We destroyed his business for about five years.  Destroyed his name for five years.  Yeah, maybe it's a good trade-off.  He had a rough five years because of us.  Now no one remembers.  There was a day, Patrice, because of us, to cover the Boston Herald, all the bar owners  pouring Sam Adams down the fucking sink.  Why?  Front fucking page because of us. 
[03:30:30]  Why?  Because he was sponsored our dumb sex for Sam.  Right.  And he didn't know what he was getting into.  Because they felt it was bad.  They said it's fine that it's causing domestic violence and drunk driving deaths.  But the fact that O.B. Anthony used it in front of the fucking asshole Boston bar owners.  Hardcore Irish bar owners pouring it down the fucking sink.  Made the front page of the Herald.  I would love to.  Could you find that?  Is there?  Nah, probably not.  That might be tough to find.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Unfortunately, we haven't talked to Jim Cook since.  And he used to be a really good friend of the show. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, wow.  He brought us on vacation with us.  Yeah.  The Sam Adams guy?  Everything.  We did fucking gigs at his brewery, which is in the middle of the ghetto.  Where at?  Oh, man.  In Boston?  Do you remember where it was then?  Way in the ghetto.  In Boston?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it was like in the middle of nowhere, too.  Yeah, it was scary getting in and out.  Yeah, that's the bottle.  That is it.  That's definitely it.  Fuck it.  You fucking...  What a prick.  You $4 beer.  Drink that shit when you get home, nigga. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, right?  I'm bringing it in tomorrow.  Down that.  Fuck.  I really thought we had something.  I'm like saving that thing.  Isn't it in a wood case, too?  Oh, yeah.  It's all fucking dollied up.  The wood cases work more.  Yeah, that's why I was like, oh, this has to be good shit.  Are you fucking serious?  It's in a wood case.  I'll tweet it later.  That was it.  Wait, was it this stuff?  Because this is different.  Come on.  That's it.  Come on.  This stuff is different than the triple.  Yeah, but how much is it?  I don't know.  I hope it's even less. 
[03:32:00]  It's $2.  Come on.  I hope it's even less.  Yeah, watch.  Did ours have three M's on it?  I think it did.  It was the Millennium.  Come on.  Let's roll this dice again.  Mike's heart is more serious.  Come on.  Let's do this.  Come on.  I can't even find it for sure.  Oh, see?  It's very rare.  It's very rare.  You can't buy this shit, right?  We're the only ones with it.  Look, unopened rare.  Three down.  Sam Adams, Millennium, L, Triple M.  How much?  Here we go.  Come on.  Come on, bitch.  How much?  There's the case.  Come on.  Sold for.  There's the case. 
[03:32:30]  $14.  That's the case.  Shut up, sir.  That's the start.  That's the wood case.  Very rare.  Hand signed.  This is probably the one you guys have.  All right.  Hand signed.  That's what we got.  Come on.  It says that.  I say $4,910.  Sam Adams for $4,900.  Take that!  Other limited edition bottles go for more than $1,000 in online auctions.  Take that!  All right.  I would have laughed so hard if you broke it and then realized that was the one you had.  I'm glad you found a way to have some self-esteem behind this stupid beer that you know is $9.  $4,910.  But we've got... 
[03:33:00]  I know.  And you have a wooden box, too.  Look, I'll make a video.  I'm going to make a video.  I'm going to show how expensive it is, and then I'm going to take a hammer to mine.  Oh, wow.  Those type of videos do very well on the wall.  And it's liquor or it's beer?  It's like hardcore, over-the-top, 500-proof.  It's made like beer, but the process they do, they put it through so much that it becomes  like liquor.  Yeah.  It becomes like cognac.  It's 21%.  Wow.  Is that a lot?  Yeah.  Wow.  Is that a lot?  For beer, of course it is. 
[03:33:30]  What is that the equivalent of?  It's like a...  21%.  What is that?  Vodka's what?  40.  Vodka's 40?  Yeah.  Most spirits are 40.  It's like a liquor.  Liquor is usually around 20%.  All right.  So it's...  Well, we'll lick him.  It's like Jägermeister.  You know, something like that.  Yeah, that's it.  So two shots equal one shot of vodka or something.  That's it right there.  That's the shit.  With the blue felt.  Right.  What is the price?  How is that rooting against him?  It's very difficult to find. 
[03:34:00]  I'm having trouble finding your rooting against him.  I know.  It makes me very happy.  Jimmy wants it to be worth nothing.  Of course.  Or break it when it's worth a lot.  Yes.  So what is it?  $10 or worth $5,000?  No, no, no.  It's just $10.  Because that's the thing.  There's two different ones.  But Noah Jim Cook, he probably gave us the cheap one, thinking it was the...  You know, and just put it in the nice box.  What box?  If it says triple Bach on it, it's $10.  If it has three M's on it, it's like $5,000.  I think it might be triple Bach, because we've been saying triple Bach for years. 
[03:34:30]  No, but I think he gave us triple Bach once.  Really?  And then he gave us the millennium, because I remember seeing the case says millennium on it.  I better find that fucking bottle, man.  Oh, I gotta look at that.  God damn it.  Now I gotta find it.  Yeah.  I might have ditched it, thinking it was...  Oh, in the move?  I don't know.  Now I'm a little scared.  I'm gonna take a look, yo.  $5,000, though.  $4,000, anyway, right?  Yeah, but you said that they were signed and numbered and stuff, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Was there a number on it?  I don't remember.  Yeah, I think every bottle was numbered.  Well, because that's the good stuff. 
[03:35:00]  I mean, that triple Bach shit's not gonna be signed.  All mocked?  All mimbed?  No, no, no.  Put mine online for fucking sale, man.  Yeah.  Pay for my trip.  Why not?  Apparently this is very rare.  Joking.  There's only 3,000 bottles?  Yes.  Yeah, that's about...  That's it.  Only 3,000, and we have two of them.  There you go.  Nice.  We're in.  Ain't worth shit.  I'm glad we got to the bottom of that.  Yeah.  I wouldn't even drink that shit. 
[03:35:30]  Huh?  And I'll drink anything.  Let me say hi to Bill.  Hello.  Hello, Bill.  Hey, gentlemen.  How are you?  Yeah, that shit, it's nothing but triple Bach in the fancy 750 milliliter bottle.  Triple Bach was only $7 a bottle in the store.  It's just in a nice bottle with a nice case and stuff.  It ain't worth shit.  No, I mean, it would be great for...  It would be great for the show if we had the shitty one, but now we're starting to think  that maybe...  Yeah, we might have the good one, so...  So, blow me.  We should have stopped where we were and make everyone believe that we got fucked, but I 
[03:36:00]  really think we actually got one of those nice bottles.  I'm going to look.  That's worth a few bucks.  No, you don't.  It was one of the limited edition.  I believe there was only 1,000.  I used to work for a distributor and a liquor store.  You said 3,000.  What's the matter with you?  You listen to the show?

Oh, yeah, over there.  All right, Denny was part of the big tequila and donut day, and he was great. 
[03:41:00]  Consummate radio professional.  Absolutely.  I want to see how the rest of his day was.  Here he comes.  That was Friday, of course.  Dennis Falcone.  Dennis.  This mic's hot?  Oh, yeah.  The mic is hot.  Oh, crap.  No, no, you don't move the mic when it's hot.  We all know that now.  We learned that.  How are you?  Good, good.  I've got a catchphrase.  What's your catchphrase?  Is this mic hot?  Is this mic hot?  Hey, everybody.  Denny, just go like this.  I know you're a constant radio professional. 
[03:41:30]  Just go like this.  I kind of like not to move it, because you don't want the people to hear what's happening behind the scenes.  Yes.  Of course.  It doesn't give that air of professionalism.  No, it doesn't.  But doesn't that make it a little more interesting?  Well, sure, but today is Motown Monday.  Oh, Motown Monday.  Is it Motown Monday?  Yeah.  Oh, so is that on the 60s channel?  Oh, it's always Motown Monday in my world.  Oh, oh.  And you see the way you could use that on Monday is on Broadway, there is a new musical opening about Motown.  And then you could do a cross-promote to Soul Town here at SiriusXM, which plays a lot of Motown. 
[03:42:00]  So there's always a way to work pop culture things into cross-promoting.  Do you think of any other channel besides this one at all?  I listen to the Pearl Jam channel, and that's it, because I don't have our channel in my car.  Yeah, but I mean like...  That's literally the only channel.  But a listener, I get it, as a listener, but as a guy employed here working, do you consider  any other channel on the...  No, I wouldn't cross-promote any of these.  Exactly.  No.  Exactly.  Why?  It helps sell the value of the service. 
[03:42:30]  Who cares, though?  You know, like there's a new show tonight, Bates Motel.  Right.  You could promote the Elvis channel, Heartbreak Hotel.  You play that.  You kind of work things into...  Oh, would you do something like that?  Like, hey, tonight, premiering is...  Yeah, but now he's getting ahead of himself, because he wants...  You should promote Motown Monday for us, the way you just did.  I could promote Motown Monday.  You need a song to...  Yeah, how about Sal?  How about All I Need by The Temptations?  Ah, that's a good one. 
[03:43:00]  It doesn't have enough ramp time.  Oh, we'll make it work.  Do you know how much ramp time that song has?  I think it's got 12.  He knows every song's ramp time.  If I did yet, Sal, All I Need.  We call it the intro, Jimmy.  He calls it the ramp time.  Let's give him some juice here.  Pump it up.  Oh, it's a Motown Monday here at SiriusXM.  We always refer to these guys as being tan, tall, and talented.  And all I need is a Temptations on SiriusXM.  Yeah, but get into the cross-promote with Broadway. 
[03:43:30]  Oh, that's great.  With Broadway?  No, I just wanted to hit the song.  Yeah.  Well, I understand.  If you do a back sell.  Hey, by the way, if you love The Tempting Temptations,  you can find lots of them over on SiriusXM's Soul Town.  Channel 49, Nethamah Classic, sold on Motown, 24-7.  That's it.  That's unbelievable.  He knows everything about the Decades Channels.  It's the art of the Segway.  It is.  It is.  So we want to know how the rest of your Friday was after the tequila shots.  All right.  You did three on Friday. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Were you feeling it the rest of the day?  I was a little sleepy by about 10 o'clock or so.  Right.  And I just had a couple of pretzels and a couple of seltzers,  and that took me right out of it.  Seltzer and pretzels.  And you were right.  Yeah, yeah.  That was it.  Yeah.  I was feeling good.  And what did you have to do?  Feedback to work on the weekend shows.  Oh.  We have the doo-wop show on the 50s channel to take care of.  Norman Knight does two shows here on the weekend on the 50s channel.  Oh.  So there's lots of things going on.  Plus, I'm always working on show prep and what's happening.  Show prep and what's happening.  Wow.  What is that?  What is in front of you? 
[03:44:30]  It's always good to carry a clipboard around.  He carries shows.  And he does.  He carries a clipboard.  It shows that you're busy, and you always just know what's going on.  Like today, the NCAA tournament.  Everybody's talking about that.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  Brackets.  So you could talk about that.  What do you got on the brackets?  What do you got on the NCAA tournament?  I would cross-promote to the Mad Dog Radio channel.  Oh, very good.  Channel 86.  Where they're talking sports all night and all day.  But how would that sound?  On Mad Dog Channel?  No, I mean, how would the cross-promote sound?  Hey, boy. 
[03:45:00]  I tell you, if you were maybe playing a rubber ball by Bobby V.  Hey, that ball was bouncing by Bobby V.  And speaking of bouncing, the NCAA tournaments, how's your brackets looking?  Well, check it out on SiriusXM Channel 86.  Mad Dog, we're talking that NCAA action all day and all night long.  I swear to you, I wouldn't know what channel Mad Dog is on.  Dude, I was just going to say, people ask me, so you're on SiriusXM?  What channel are you on?  I don't even know what channel I'm on.  Never mind Mad Dog.  All right, I really do listen to the Pearl Jam channel a lot.  Yeah.  I don't know what number it is. 
[03:45:30]  I don't know the number.  Well, that's why you have to do show prep ahead of time.  Well, I'll find it out.  I mean, again, we have a lot of channels here.  I don't know off the top of my head.  So you do a little prep.  You do a little prep work ahead of time.  You want to talk about that?  Sure.  You want to talk about the Ultra Music Festival, which is going down in a sunny FLA down in Miami Way?  Down in Miami Way.  Yeah, there you go.  That's on SiriusXM Channel 52.  That's how you say Miami?  Also known as Electric Area, yeah.  Miami Way.  And the Sunshine State.  Do you do the left coast thing for LA?  Casey and the Sunshine Band, maybe a little shake, shake, shake your booty. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, from the Sunshine State.  Yeah, those guys came out of Hialeah, Florida.  They did.  Back in 1975, I tell you, when this song came out of the AM radio, it just exploded, right?  When you heard Get Down Tonight?  Yeah.  I mean, that song that changed my life.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, the whole disco thing and everything that was happening there.  Of course.  There's just so many great things.  Sal, can we get the song?  Oh, why would Sal get the song?  What are you doing in there?  He's too busy.  His thumbs up his ass.  Sal, what's up?  Sal.  And you see another good cross-promote, then, if you're going to talk about that.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What, Sal?  I'm looking up KC and the Sunshine Band. 
[03:46:30]  You just said you don't know how to spell KC and the Sunshine Band.  You don't know how to spell KC and the Sunshine Band.  I honestly didn't know if it was the letters or it was the word KC.  It's the letters.  Oh, my God.  Do you know what J-O is?  These kids are young.  A-H.  Holy fuck.  CS.  How about Iraq takes...  Iraq, can you just go back in there?  Exactly.  Just squeeze back in there.  You could even cross-reference it by Get Down.  Or just look up Sunshine.  You got it now, Sal?  Or look up Enva.  Sal, you got it now?  I'm looking for it.  Oh, my God. 
[03:47:00]  Which one of the deep tracks?  Yeah, it is.  It's one that's very...  No, it's not.  That's a power hit.  Oh, all day power category.  That's a power hit.  They're called power hits?  Yeah, it's a power.  What are the categories?  Well, you probably have A, your powers, B, your subpowers, C, your secondaries, D, your tertiaries.  When I worked at BAB, we had the wow category.  Wow.  You're only allowed to pick one song out of the wow category per shift.  Why?  What would happen if you played two?  Oh, God, I don't know, because I was too scared to break the rule.  Oh. 
[03:47:30]  You guys don't have a cough button here, because if you have to clear your throat, just press  down the phone.  You don't have that.  Because it's unprofessional to...  Well, yeah.  The alcohol noise is great to hear, though.  I guess so.  Oh, Heath, you found it.  You found it quicker than Sal did.  I could have had it a long time ago.  Okay, it's K, C.  Do you want the...  We actually have engineers in there looking for this.  Oh, my God.  I know it's in there.  I could have brought my hard drive of hits in here for you.  He's got a hard drive of hits, we learned.  Right.  It's a hard drive of hits. 
[03:48:00]  Why are you standing?  What's that?  Because you get better voice.  Jimmy, he thinks we should be standing as we broadcast.  I used to stand for years when we were on the afternoons, but I don't think it helps  at all.  It just keeps your energy level up.  When you're sitting down, you kind of relax, sort of like that.  You've got to keep that energy.  Three o'clock in the morning, FM disc jockey thing.  Yeah, they start falling asleep.  Not bad.  Are overnight guys important in radio?  I think so.  Why?  Why?  Because they set up the morning show.  You know, if they have a good evening.  How can you set up the morning show if the morning show audience is sleeping? 
[03:48:30]  I mean, you know, America is 24-7.  When you've got guys working all night long, people working, you know, if somebody wants  to hear something, call into an overnight show.  Let you know what's going on.  Hey, don't forget, coming up right after 6 o'clock this morning, Opie and Anthony are  going to be giving away tickets, too, so they promote and they push it ahead.  So they keep people listening.  Hey, Dane Cook, funny man Dane Cook, who's celebrating a birthday, might be stopping by  this morning with Opie and Anthony.  You never know what's going to happen there.  We're keeping it here.  Oldies all night long.  See?  I think it's necessary.  Middays don't mean anything, though. 
[03:49:00]  No, sure they do.  Sure they do.  They set you up for the lunchtime request show.  Everything's just setting you for the lunchtime request show.  There's a lot of good things, a lot of good purposes.  And a good morning show, then you set the guys up to listen to the afternoon show.  Right, right.  Just keep the listener happy.  What about a night show?  Oh, a night show, without a doubt.  People going out to a ball game, going out to dinner, jumping in the car, they want to  find out what's going on.  Hit the radio.  Yeah.  Hit the radio.  Hit the radio.  What has regular radio been wrecked?  What do you think has ruined regular radio?  No, there's a lot of things. 
[03:49:30]  Limited formats.  Too many commercials on music channels.  I went off an anti-Semitic tear for 20 minutes.  For no reason.  There's a lot of things.  That's why we've got satellite radio.  All these channels.  It's just fantastic.  Do you mind if I move my hot mic?  You should probably hit the cough button.  I don't have a cough button.  You don't have a cough button.  I have one.  You don't believe it.  I got one.  It's right there.  See?  There it is.  You can have the cough button.  That's nice.  I'm going to talk into a fan now. 
[03:50:00]  I am your father.  That's what you do every time you eat and put me.  You get it?  I also brought this other manual that I had when I worked at one radio station.  It's a manual about things to do and not to do in a radio station that was given to  me when I worked at a radio station.  Wow.  Can we go through that?  Yeah, like using correct grammar.  Don't end sentences with prepositions.  What's that?  Use the correct verb tense.  It's, here are the Beatles, instead of saying, here is the association.  This is a proper way of saying things.  The association of them. 
[03:50:30]  Stay put in the studio.  Any area in the station outside of the restroom is to be considered off-limits during an air  shift.  I don't like calling it an air shift.  I like calling it a show.  A shift is when you're loading a truck or working at McDonald's or something.  This is a show.  We're in entertainment.  So I say, yeah, I got to do a shift today.  I'm on the radio broadcasting this afternoon.  Wait, so you only stay in the studio or go to the bathroom?  Yeah, you should.  And that's it.  Well, you should, because you have to know what's going on.  You know, before then, if you didn't have the internet, you'd be looking in the Joel  Whitburn book, or looking up the newspaper and seeing, you know, what you could talk about. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  So you stay into your show.  Would you ever run out of the studio mid-shift to get a photo with a celebrity?  Uh, I'd ask the celebrity to come in.  Or maybe just run out and abandon the show for a few minutes?  No, I don't think so.  I mean, you know, you have to bring the celebrity in, and I think they'd want to, you know,  promote what's going on.  It's good to get the call letters in and get the logo in the photo.  Because then when it hits the press, they'll see, wow, the Opie and Anthony show had so-and-so  in the studio.  What year did you start radio?  Uh, 1979.  Wow. 
[03:51:30]  1979.  I remember 79.  Wow.  What are some of the other do's and don'ts?  Well, let's see.  Always audition anything new.  Spots, promos, music.  Know what to expect.  How a spot or promo will sound before it hits the air.  Ah, what?  Like the intro and then the outro also, right?  The ramp time, yeah.  Especially if a record ends cold or if it fades or something.  Oh, boy, you've got to know that.  You know, and remember, you know, the proper IDs, you know, for the radio station.  What to say, what not to say.  You know, always work in the liners.  And the most important thing is your pacing.  Use the kind of delivery in a normal conversation. 
[03:52:00]  Like if you're playing Morris Albert Feelings, you wouldn't want to be talking it up, you  know, like screaming over the intro.  You'd have to bring your voice down.  Because it's like, it's a love song.  Yeah, it's a love song.  Feeling.  You can't be going, hey, that one, feelings!  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And you know, we do have a love songs channel here, too.  Oh, we do?  Channel 17.  Nothing but love songs.  And remember the other day I was mentioning about the double times?  Yes.  Wait, explain double times for Jim Norris.  Well, double time.  You give the time digitally, then normally. 
[03:52:30]  Like 6.57, 3 till 7.  So people who might not have a digital clock, they go, gee, three minutes before I have to  get out of the door.  Can't they figure it out with the 6.57 part?  What person doesn't understand that 6.57 means three of seven?  Like what person hears 6.57 and goes, oh, good, I got 25 minutes before seven.  Aren't they too dumb to count on?  No, no, it's because they're just coming out, you know, they're just waking up and  they're kind of groggy around the house.  You want to make it very easy for the listener, right?  Wow.  You got a spoon feed. 
[03:53:00]  There you go, yeah.  I learned about spoon feed.  Keep it simple, Stanley.  I always heard keep it simple, stupid, but Stanley's nice.  No.  And the most important thing is watch your levels stay out of the red.  You know, don't keep things on.  Oh, we're in the red constantly.  There's just a lot.  Like, never count the music.  Like, say, here's the first of four in a row.  Why not?  Well, because then people go, okay, so then three more songs are going to hit commercials.  But here we could say something cool like, we're in the middle of a zillion in a row  because we never play commercials.  We just keep it going.  The music never stops.  It's true. 
[03:53:30]  And the entertainment never starts.  I love it.  And this is probably very important.  Please treat all equipment, buttons, and switches with respect as if you own them.  The finest gear in the world can be turned into junk if it's physically abused.  So we've had a few coffee mishaps.  Oh, that's probably the biggest.  That's probably the most common.  You've got to put a sign on the studio, no food and drink in the studio.  Including the hosts?  Well, yeah.  I mean, come on.  In your commercial break, you could step outside the studio and sip a little water.  But that goes against your other rule.  Never stop outside the studio. 
[03:54:00]  If you have to go to the bathroom, though.  Right.  If you have to go to the bathroom.  But what about food?  Just keep it away from the microphone.  All right?  Keep it away from the controls there.  Yeah, the controls.  You don't want to spill anything on it.  That's probably the number one thing that happens to equipment is things get spilt on it.  But there's a lot of different things to do.  You know, during a shift change in the studio, hello is just about all that's necessary.  Like, hey, I have to say hello.  You don't have to talk about other things with fellow air talent, especially stuff behind the scenes.  Oh, you don't like a good crossover?  Well, it's a good crossover if you're talking about something going on at the station. 
[03:54:30]  You know, hey, what'd you do this weekend?  That's not really important to the listener.  Oh.  Yeah, a person thought they know anything about the personalities.  Shouldn't they know a little more about the personality?  Well, you have to watch that because you can't...  Cousin Brucey's been on the radio for 50 years and no one knows anything about him.  Yeah.  He's your cousin.  That's all you need to know.  That's all you need to know?  We've been doing it wrong all these years.  We have been.  Fuck.  And again, if you have any questions about this, the programming director's office is always hoping to be fully discussed.  Oh, great.  Wouldn't that be a treat to go walking in there to discuss things? 
[03:55:00]  Like, do you guys get off the air and have a little morning show meeting?  No.  No.  Yeah.  From this floor to the lobby.  Exactly.  So then your fucking fingers meet the elevator button.  So then you put together all your prep stuff for tomorrow's show.  Say, hey, we're going to be talking about this.  We're going to be talking about what happened on Dancing with the Stars last night so we could review on...  Oh, so you have a little meeting.  You prepare so much, but you can only talk at, you know, 15 seconds at a time.  It's always good to have more stuff than not enough stuff. 
[03:55:30]  Right?  Even if you have a whole bunch of stuff, I remember a good buddy of mine, Ross Britton.  Remember Ross?  Oh, yeah.  I remember Ross Britton.  He's a dish jockey.  And he was into the show prep thing years ago.  He would have, like, 40 pages of stuff.  40 pages?  And only use two or three pages.  Then why have the other 38?  Why not knock it down to 20 pages?  Well, because it's good to know.  Say you're playing In the Midnight Hour by the Wicked One, Mr. Wilson Pickett.  You look down on your sheet and say, gee, he was born back on this date in 1941.  All right, why don't we do a little something with that?  Let's hear a little something.  Oh, we got Casey in the Sunshine Band, too. 
[03:56:00]  Do we have Casey?  Yeah, we'll do Casey first.  Let's hear a little Casey.  You got it, Sam.  He's going to play it.  All right.  Here you go.  Shake, shake, shake your booty.  No, we got it.  Oh, we're going to get down tonight.  Oh, boy, I tell you, it sounded so good.  Blasted out of your radio back in 1975.  Didn't get any better than this.  These guys came out of Hialeah, Florida.  Right now in Florida, got the Ultra Music Festival going on.  You can check that out on SiriusXM Channel 52.  But right now, it's Casey.  Oh, yeah.  Woo.  Fuck. 
[03:56:30]  Do you have a full-time shift here?  No, I'm just on standby.  So I've been keeping a lot of things ready.  How is this guy not on the air?  Why are you just on standby?  Because I'm doing programming work, doing a lot of things.  You know, there's a lot more than what comes out of the speakers.  You do any shifts?  Yeah, sometimes I fill in on the 60s, fill in on the 50s or something.  I would love to hear that.  If they need me, I'm here.  I want to fucking hear that.  But I want to know when you're going to be on air, because I will listen to that program.  I like the Decades channels.  I'd like to listen to a little 60s, 70s hosted by you. 
[03:57:00]  It would be great.  It's all about having fun.  Yeah.  It's all about having fun.  I enjoy coming to work every day and mixing in with a lot of you broadcasters and stuff, fellow broadcasters.  There's a lot of great legends at work here at Sirius X Center.  I'm just happy to be a part of it.  Fantastic.  Wow.  I really am.  Okay, if I move this microphone up a little bit.  Oh, jeez.  I heard that.  Breaking all the rules.  You kind of heard that.  And these headphones are nice.  I have the Koss Pro 44A's.  The green ones.  You ever see those?  I don't know what that is.  The professional disc jockey headphones. 
[03:57:30]  I'm going to bring those in.  He knows all the headphones.  Those are professional disc jockeys.  Are those the best headphones to use?  Cousin Bruce, he used them for years.  Yeah.  And once I saw him wearing those, I said, hey.  Is he your idol?  Bruce, yeah.  He's on the country.  Bruce, he is.  Late Robert W. Morgan worked out in Los Angeles.  Rick Shaw down in Miami.  Rick Shaw?  Yeah, a lot of great disc jockeys.  Wow.  Let's back up here, too.  Rick Shaw.  Let's back up.  Did he work with Tractor Trailer?  Rick Shaw.  Tractor Trailer?  That's awful. 
[03:58:00]  That's a terrible name.  Rick Shaw.  A lot of radio stations years ago would have a jingle package of Stan Holiday.  And if Stan left, the next disc jockey came in, he would get that jingle.  Really?  He would have to be Stan Holiday.  He'd have to be Stan Holiday.  Or they would just cut it up, you know, so they wouldn't have to...  Redo the jingle package.  Redo the jingle.  Have to buy another jingle or something.  That would suck.  You have no identity.  Yeah.  One radio station would always give guys the same names, like Jim James.  So it's easier for people to remember their names, too.  What about a name like Chuck Roast? 
[03:58:30]  That would be a funny name.  That's a funny name.  Who would laugh at that?  I'm just curious.  I think people, simple people, would probably laugh at it.  Simple people would be called it.  Like, what's wrong with just a regular name?  Well, I think Rick Shaw is a good name, though.  I mean, it could be his real name.  Yes, if you're fucking Chinese and you have a fucking taxi.  It could be S-H-A-W.  Well, of course.  But it's not Rick Shaw.  No, I believe it was.  But it's supposed to be catchy.  Yeah, and it was.  But it's not, though.  Why wouldn't you use his name, whatever his name was, you know, Rick Humberkunt, whatever  his real name was. 
[03:59:00]  Why wouldn't they just use their real name?  Because it's not memorable.  Yeah, it's got to be.  Cousin Brucie, that's memorable.  Yeah, Cousin Brucie.  Rick Hunderhunt.  You want to do that other talk up there?  We got a little Wilson Pickett?  I had a question.  Do you have a shift today?  No, I don't.  What's all the prep for?  Just in case.  Just in case I get the call, I'm ready.  Yeah, I go through all the prep services.  You're the only guy on the porch that's taken by Ag were just hoping the actors would show up.  I love this guy.  He's well-prepared, dude.  And the chance of you doing a show today is pretty much nil.  Well, you've got to be ready.  You know, like, you've got to be in the bullpen. 
[03:59:30]  You never know when you're going to be able to throw.  You might need you in the eighth inning there to come in and get that lefty out, and you're  a specialist.  Imagine.  When was the last time you got the call?  Last week or so.  One of the guys.  Last week or so.  Yeah, last week, I believe it was.  Last week.  So you're just what?  On the 60s channel.  You were just out there?  Or were you home or something?  You were at my desk.  You were at your desk.  And what did they say?  And what did they say?  Who came up to you?  The program director, Lou Simon of the 60s channel.  Say, could you fill in at 12 o'clock today?  And you said?  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  I'm ready.  And you had your prep and everything? 
[04:00:00]  I got my prep.  Yeah, I went on the internet and took care of things.  Actually, you know, on the iPad in the morning, I look over things that I want to maybe talk  about, keep a note there.  So it's very easy.  You know, you can't be a lazy disc jockey anymore.  You have to have, you know, you have to know what's going on.  You have to be in tune about what's happening, you know, with everything.  Pop culture, the news.  I like learning things along with the listener.  Yeah, it's kind of fun.  That's my strong suit.  Just kind of learning.  We get to be surprised, too.  Right.  How about that Wilson Pickett? 
[04:00:30]  We got that ready?  Oh, sure.  Let's do this.  Sirius XM playing a great one.  I tell you, he's a Rock and Roll Hall of Famer.  We called him the Wicked One.  Wilson Pickett.  You can catch his music on Soul Town, Channel 49.  He was born back on this date in 1941.  I'm going to wait.  Holy shit.  He got the 1941.  I'm going to wait.  Right there.  It's a fucking, it's an amazing talent.  Do you think that ruins the song when people talk over the news?  Oh, no.  I think it's part of the fabric of the format. 
[04:01:00]  People enjoy that.  I mean, if you're on an album rock station, classic rock, you're not going to be talking  up.  You tell.  You leave the intros alone.  Yeah.  Hold these not so much.  Fabric of the format.  It's part of the, you know, format.  It's like when you go to, you know, for ice cream and you want sprinkles, that's part  of the, you expect sprinkles on there.  That is a good point.  I think it's part of the jingles.  That is a good point.  Who are you on the New York radio message board?  No, I just, I read that thing and I chuckle because those guys on there make you chuckle. 
[04:01:30]  They know everything about broadcasting.  Oh, don't they?  Yeah.  They've never been in the game, but it is amazing.  It is amazing.  You gotta love them.  The original name of that message board was Monday Morning Quarterbacking Douches, but  that was already taken.  I love it.  I love the professionalism.  He's got a clipboard.  He's well prepared for a show he'll never do today.  For a show that he'll never do today. 
[04:02:00]  Always carry a clipboard.  I've got to get a clipboard.  Do you know something, by the way, if you walk around here with a clipboard, people  are absolutely going to think you do something.  They're not going to question it.  Why would you walk around with a clipboard if you're not doing something that needs a  clipboard?  It's the McDonald's philosophy.  It's like always, even if there's nobody in the restaurant, keep wiping down the counter.  Always be cleaning, right?  Always, yeah.  Just keep wiping down the counter.  ABC.  ABC.  Always be cleaning.  That's right.  I used to enjoy sweeping up the parking lot when I worked in McDonald's because I'd put the 
[04:02:30]  radio on and I'd listen at night to the radio.  I'd go out there and, you know, back then when I used to smoke, I would have a cigarette  and the general manager came out.  He goes, you know, if you want to smoke, punch out and go home and listen to the radio.  So I did.  Oh, shit.  And I thought I'd get calls from like Burger King or something or Hardee's.  Uh-huh.  I figured I was zany, but I never got it.  No, huh?  Never got the call.  You know what's amazing about doing the prep, even though you don't know, all his prep  is topical, so he can't even hold it until he has it. 
[04:03:00]  Right, right.  That's what I'm saying.  Exactly.  So all this goes in the garbage and he starts fresh tomorrow.  No, you can always work it back in because, say, you don't have a Wilson Pickett song  on today's playlist.  Hey, he was born back on this day, 1941.  We celebrated his birthday yesterday.  Well, how would you change?  Oh, I said yesterday.  Say, you just got to keep these things in mind.  Like, we missed, on Friday, we missed Ides of March.  We could have played Vehicle.  Ah.  Why don't we play it now and see how this would have worked?  And a good bit that I wrote up about that.  All right, hold on.  Let's get the song from it.  Do we have the song Ides of March? 
[04:03:30]  Oh, wow, he's fast in there.  Now, you might remember this song on American Idol when Bo Bice sang it.  A whole new generation have discovered it.  1970, it's the original from the Ides of March.  Drive away, baby!  Wow.  See, and you just hit a ramp there.  Or you could say, here's vehicles.  Right.  You decided to hit a...  Okay.  So songs have more than one ramp sometimes.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  And some people just want to sing along with it, you know, tap on the dish.  But I practice a lot in the car.  Do you?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What's your favorite song to introduce?  Like, Bob Shepard of the Yankees said that his favorite name ever to introduce was Mickey 
[04:04:00]  Mantle.  He just liked saying Mickey Mantle.  Mickey Mantle.  What is your favorite song?  Wow.  That's real tough because there's so many great...  I love playing Moonlight Feels Right by Starbuck, 1976.  Great summertime song.  Moonlight.  Diddle-ddle-ddle-ddle-ddle-ddle-ddle-wah-wah.  Very few songs have a xylophone in it.  That has a xylophone.  That's a reason for that.  That's a great one.  Xylophone.  That's a great one.  You know, staying alive because you're just pumping the energy.  You know, you close your eyes and you're just feeling that guy strutting down 86th 
[04:04:30]  street in Brooklyn.  Exactly.  So there's just so many.  He's grabbing his chest.  Hey, could you play Stayin' Alive?  I want to hear him introduce that.  Oh, it was right around this time of the year, 1977, when a music came out.  And you said, hey, what is this song from?  It's from a brand new movie called Saturday Night Fever, The Brothers Give.  They're going to be struck with Stayin' Alive.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  That's good. 
[04:05:00]  You know, it was kind of interesting because back then when you heard How Deep Is Your Love,  you said, gee, is this a new song by the Bee Gees?  Where is it coming from?  And then the song would be in that movie.  Ah.  Well, it was a huge soundtrack, that one.  One of the biggest soundtracks of all time, right?  Right.  And, you know, we play a lot of that great, all that great disco classics on the Studio  54 channel, Sirius XM 15.  Why wouldn't they make that channel 54?  That's what I thought he was going to say.  Oh, that was easy.  What's on 54?  I don't know.  Oh, it must not be a music channel. 
[04:05:30]  You can't switch that?  That seems like a logical thing to do.  Well, these things are for people higher than my pay grade.  You can't have Studio 54.  Higher than his pay grade.  He's such a good soldier.  I know.  He's just like, ah, it's higher than my pay grade.  But you can't have Studio 54 on time of 15.  15.  I've seen you at that desk so many times.  I had no idea that every minute you're just fighting being fired.  Oh, Jimmy!  I'm joking with him.  He's fantastic.  I see him every day.  Do you program the music?  Yeah.  I program the music for the 50s, 60s, help out on the 80s channel. 
[04:06:00]  What's the most important about, let's say, an hour block of music?  What's most important getting in there?  What do you want to do with that hour?  Well, you want to make sure everything flows properly.  You don't want to have too many slow songs back-to-back.  You don't want to have too many R&B songs.  You don't want to have two instrumentals within the hour or something.  So you want to have a good flow so people get a good representation of the 50s.  So you're playing some Rock and Roll Hall of Famers.  You're playing some One-Hit Wonders.  You're playing some early surf music. 
[04:06:30]  Just a little bit of everything.  A good cross-representation of the decade.  See, you don't just pick songs and just pop them in willy-nilly.  Do you know how fucking revolted he would be by the way I do my Boneyard show?  Oh, God, Jimmy.  Oh, would you hate it?  But that's a different board, don't you, Jimmy?  I do.  With all your Boneyard prep?  No, I just draw giant tits and hairy pussies on it and I show people.  Oh, please.  Willie's Roadhouse is on 54?  No, this is the closest thing. 
[04:07:00]  We don't even have a Channel 54.  So he just makes 54?  That's why he said, I don't know.  It's like, what's on 54?  He's like, I don't know.  Because there is no 54.  But on Channel 56, Willie's Roadhouse?  Yeah.  You know who Charlie Pride is?  Of course.  Do you mention in your intro how he always says his K's like this tall?  He's 75 years young today.  I didn't say young.  75 years young.  Oh, you're one of those guys?  Yeah.  That's nice.  People feel young.  And you can hear a lot of Charlie's music on that channel.  Oh.  On Willie's Roadhouse. 
[04:07:30]  Like Kiss an Angel Good Morning.  You know what's sad?  Tall.  Is anybody going to San Antone?  Here's a company man, but the company doesn't give a fuck about him.  I know.  I know.  He should be like CEO.  He should be the CEO.  The C-E-fucking-O.  You should be upstairs, Dennis.  Could you play his Charlie Pride song?  What's the one I want to hear?  Oh, how they love to talk to call.  I got a question for Dennis as he finds that song.  Does it make you mad when they just give radio shows to guys that have never done radio? 
[04:08:00]  No, because those are guys who bring a lot to the table.  It's always positive.  It's like the color analyst.  You know, the play-by-play guy.  We call him Frank.  I don't like two play-by-play guys in the booth.  I like a play-by-play guy and a color guy so he can analyze what's going on.  You know what I mean?  When I played with the Indians back in 87, we had a left hand.  So you're okay that Eminem gets paid millions and he doesn't even have to show up?  Well, we have his name.  We have his authenticity to the channel.  And he brings a lot to the table. 
[04:08:30]  I think Eminem does a credible job here.  More crickets, huh?  Have you seen him here a lot?  Yeah, all the time.  We go to lunch.  He's lying.  No, no, he's just lying, Dennis.  Not really.  It bothers you, doesn't it?  No, it doesn't bother me.  Hey, it's their company.  Did you have any mobile DJ gigs this past weekend?  Not this weekend, but I've got one on Thursday night.  Yeah, what do you got?  I've got a dance for the United Cerebral Palsy people.  Nice people.  I do a lot of good dances like that.  You're going to see some unusual dances. 
[04:09:00]  I do a lot of good things for them.  That's good.  People like to have a good time.  Out at Long Island Post.  It used to be CW Post.  They don't call it CW Post.  They don't call it L.I. Post.  L.I. University.  That's crazy.  I'm trying to make it sound like something it isn't.  So we get out there and we have some fun.  So you should be booked every weekend.  Why aren't you booked every weekend?  I got a job this weekend.  Got one Saturday, too.  Got a birthday party.  I believe it's christening.  He spins.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  So I actually picked up some new hula hoops this weekend.  You know?  Got to bring some hula hoops out for the kids.  Re-tape the limbo pole.  Sure. 
[04:09:30]  Re-tape the limbo pole.  Yeah, well, I got a nice, like a big long dowel, like a big rod that you would have in  the closet.  I painted it, you know, and I put tape on it and sparkles and everything.  You re-tape the limbo pole, seriously.  So I, you know, bring the limbo pole out there.  Just drag some pieces to bring the limbo pole out.  Yeah, and you get two kids, usually some older kids, some teenagers who are, you know,  kind of hip for the room and they don't want to do it.  They help out.  Say, all right, I need you two guys to help me out with the limbo pole.  And they hold the limbo pole.  And we get, you know, whoever birthday is to, you know, lead the line.  Uh-huh.  Limbo, limbo. 
[04:10:00]  And you do that.  Keep the limbo going.  What other activities do you do with some of these?  Musical chairs is always a big hit.  Oh, yeah.  How old are the kids that play musical chairs?  Communion age.  Younger, 12 years old.  We could do adult ones, too.  Adult ones are fine at block parties.  Oh, really?  Yeah, do you ever play musical chairs and there's one person in a wheelchair and they  just have to kind of sit there while everybody runs around them and they win every time?  We always make sure the kids are winners.  That's the thing.  Everybody gets a problem.  How do you do that?  When you get knocked out, you come over and see me and I give you a pair of, like, psychedelic 
[04:10:30]  glasses or something.  You know, so everybody feels good.  How many...  I can't tell you how great...  Or Hawaiian lays.  I call them tropical necklaces, though.  I don't call them Hawaiian lays.  How many times have you thought about swallowing a shotgun?  I just enjoy having fun with it.  Oh, my God.  It'd be out of my mind.  You don't call it lay.  You don't call it...  Tropical necklace.  It's a tropical necklace.  Tropical necklace.  Tropical necklace.  As we play Kokomo in the background.  I would be out of my mind.  I would just contemplate suicide every day. 
[04:11:00]  I love this lifestyle.  God bless you, Dennis.  I'm having fun.  Dennis Falcone.  That's the website again.  We got to make sure you're booked all summer long.  We're trying.  DennisFalcone.com.  I appreciate it, though.  Got a couple of guys...  Gave me a couple of hits over the weekend.  Said they enjoyed me on the show.  That was very nice.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Thank you.  I just picture so many bodies in his crawlspace somewhere.  It's just...  Yeah, sitting there with a bunch of cadavers, just fucking hitting the post.  He's such a nice guy and just, like, so positive about everything. 
[04:11:30]  I really enjoy that because it's so rare around this building.  What else is on your prep sheet for today, considering you're never going to do it?  Maybe we'll use some.  You should just do it here.  We mentioned that Donna Summer received three consecutive albums, and she got the Walk  of Fame back on the stage in 1992.  Oh.  How's she doing?  Not too well, but we do have her memories.  How about a little bit?  But we do have her memories.  We do have the music.  Right.  Last dance.  Last dance.  Time to wrap things up.  We hope everybody has themselves a great time celebrating today. 
[04:12:00]  Happy birthday again to Opie, celebrating his birthday today.  Let's have a nice round of applause for our guest of honor.  Make sure you guys get home safe.  We'll see you again real soon.  If you'd like to have me entertaining your party, make sure you check me out, DennisValcone.com.  Let's take it back in time.  The movie TGIF.  Thank God it's Donna Summer.  And last dance.  Take care, everybody.  Get home safe.  Get home safe.  I love them. 
[04:12:30]  You know, and if it's a Friday night.  I just want to hug them.  And if it's a Friday night party, hey, have a great weekend.  Right.  Right, right.  You know, if it's Saturday, hey, enjoy your Sunday.  Uh-huh.  And if it's Sunday, have a great weekend.  What a positive guy.  Everything is so positive.  You ever get mad?  You ever have any negativity in your life?  Well, sometimes when I can't get the people up on the dance floor.  You know, because you feel like you're doing something wrong, right?  I do a lot of jobs for volunteer fire departments around the country.  Those bums.  God bless those guys who go out there at 3 o'clock in the morning if the phone rings and they've got to be there. 
[04:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  So when they, you know, all of a sudden you see a table with 25 guys, you've got to go,  I don't think these guys are going to be dancing.  Right.  So you just play what they want.  Hey, you got any thorough good?  So you play George Thorogood.  Uh-huh.  Play any boneyard music or something like that.  Sure, sure.  Try to entertain, play to the crowd.  So even if I have to be a human jukebox, just play to the crowd.  Do you believe in the devil's music?  No, I don't like to play any devil's music at parties.  No, huh?  No.  Well, there was a good disco song called The Devil's Gun by CJ and Company. 
[04:13:30]  That's a good song.  Did you hit the post on Hell Awaits by Slayer?  No, I'm not too familiar with that.  That's what we should do.  Make him hit the post on some evil songs.  Yeah, let's get some Slayer.  I want to see if he can hit.  Hey, wait, no.  Let's get Evil by Merciful Fate.  I want to see if he can hit the post on that.  What's the ramp time of that?  Because he doesn't know the song.  I don't know the song.  But I do have other work to do.  He'll be able to hit it.  Oh, you're trying to get out of here?  He does have other work to do.  Look, he doesn't want to deal with the devil's music.  Well, no, the thing is, you see, that goes back to something on when we were talking about  the manual here. 
[04:14:00]  Oh, yes.  I would have to listen to that song ahead of time in the production studio.  Right, right.  So I would know.  So, you know, because I worked at a country radio station years ago, and I wasn't as familiar  with the music.  So I'd get in about an hour before time as far as I was on the air.  Oh, my God.  And I'd look at the playlist and say, gee, I'm playing this new song by Tim McGraw.  And I'd listen to it.  And I'd see that it has a nine-second ramp time.  Mm-hmm.  And what's the song about?  So I, you know, didn't go into it.  Because you never want to hear the voice of authority on the radio.  You never want to say, gee, I don't know this song.  Right.  I say nothing but I don't know.  Yeah, but that would be fun to listen to.  Yeah. 
[04:14:30]  Because it would be different.  Well, because, again, if you're the voice of authority at the country music station,  you say, oh, boy, we got a brand new one by Tim McGraw.  Tim's going out on tour next week.  You can catch him over on Polestar.com.  Find out if he's going to be in your neck of the woods.  You just always know what's going on.  Because a person tunes in the radio, and they want to hear somebody, a voice of authority.  Sure, sure.  Or someone that's going to guide them.  From now on, you've just elected your voice of authority on this radio program.  Oh, wow.  That's right.  Who is it going to be?  It's going to be me.  Jim Norton?  That's right.  Oh, talk. 
[04:15:00]  I think we want him to talk up some evil shit.  Yeah, play Evil by Merciful Fate.  It's a 30-second intro.  It's a 30-second intro.  Good gush.  What's this song about, Jimmy?  I really don't know.  Good gush.  I could read the phone book.  I was born on a cemetery.  It's about a guy who was born in a cemetery, and he violates a girl in her grave.  You got that, Dennis?  Yeah.  But talk it up like it's an oldies favorite.  What's this song called?  He's talking about how he'll dig up a girl's body and make love to shame, like he'll have 
[04:15:30]  sex with this girl's body and kind of humiliate her body after she's dead.  It's called Evil.  And the song is called Evil?  Yeah.  By Merciful Fate.  Right?  Merciful Fate.  It's off an album called Melissa.  Melissa?  Like the Allman Brothers.  Sweet Melissa.  Well, it's a little different than that song.  And you play this on Boneyard?  I play it on Boneyard.  I play it in my house.  I play it while I'm making love.  Oh.  What would be the channel number for Boneyard?  So I'll give you a cross-pronounce.  You got me by the short and curly. 
[04:16:00]  You don't know.  No!  I would.  I just say the Ozzy's Boneyard.  That is so funny.  We have no idea what channel.  I'm on the Boneyard every night.  I have no clue.  My Boneyard is.  I finally know we're on 105 and 206.  How long is time I got confused by that?  Channel 38?  No, Ozzy's Boneyard.  Yeah.  You've got to give the full name of the channel.  All right, make believe this is just a classic oldie song, okay?  We want the same delivery, please.  All right, you ready?  Go ahead, hit it.  Well, good morning.  I know it's tough getting up on a Monday morning and getting things off to work, getting the 
[04:16:30]  kids into the car, but I tell you, I've got something that's really going to get your  blood pumping.  It's a great song.  I love these guys.  I hung out with them last summer.  It's Merciful Faith and Evil.  Matter of fact, my buddy Jim Norton plays this for you on Boneyard.  You can check that out on Sirius XM Channel 38.  I heard right to that guitar there.  Right, right, right, right.  That's a ramp right there.  Yeah, so I really could, you know.  You hit one of the ramps.  I hit one of the ramps there.  But you didn't talk about the grave and all that.  No, that's not my shtick.  That's not his shtick.  That's not my shtick. 
[04:17:00]  It's like I wouldn't expect Jimmy to perform at a communion birthday.  Right.  That's not his shtick.  That was my pants on.  Yeah, that's not his shtick.  You know what?  You have to know your strengths and you have to know your weaknesses.  What if a particular radio show, we only have weaknesses?  What if we had one giant weakness?  That's the beauty of it all.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Dennis, we've seen you around here for years.  Just barely said hi to you.  Talked to Little Islanders.  Yeah, Little Yankees.  And then you became a star this past Friday on the Tequila and Donut Show that E-Rock brought to the table. 
[04:17:30]  E-Rock was a little mean to you, though.  I didn't care for that.  Yeah, I didn't like that at all.  A little mean-spirited.  No, you know, I think it's showbiz.  Dennis was also calling E-Rock.  He wasn't calling him E-Rock.  What were you calling him?  They called him Slobo.  Oh.  Was it because of his weight?  I understand.  Well, his whole, you know, he's got to come a little nicer dressed here in the office because,  I mean, he's not only in the studio with you gentlemen in the morning, he's also out there mingling.  You know, so people walk around, they want to see somebody more presentable.  Being representative of this program, maybe.  Yeah, he's basically a slovenly pig, you're saying.  You know, back in the golden age of broadcasting, broadcasters wore shirt and ties to the radio station. 
[04:18:00]  Oh.  That was nice.  If you look up a picture of William B. Williams, the legendary disc jockey who worked at WNDW.  Let's see a picture of Willie B.  Willie B. Williams.  Shirt and tie.  Shirt and tie.  He was about 25 years or so.  Oh, God.  He was there for a long time.  Oh.  Shirt and tie.  He used to play a lot of Frank Sinatra music.  He just, you know, he was just a very suave, debonair-looking guy.  That's just from another fucking time.  Willie B.  Willie B used to wear suits to baseball games, too.  There he is.  And they would lynch blacks.  They all have the Beatles.  He used to wear suits to Broadway shows.  Yeah.  Just going out. 
[04:18:30]  People used to wear a suit and tie or...  On airplanes.  Yes.  It was very nice, too.  All right.  That was very nice.  Really?  Yeah.  Get dressed up to go on a plane.  Flight 800 wrecked that.  Oh, yes.  Well, David, your shift is over, so why don't you intro the last song of your shift and  get the hell out of here.  All right.  Why don't we have something?  Hey, how about by Irene Cara?  She is 54 years young today.  Wow.  Irene Cara.  Yeah.  A little fame, maybe?  Yes.  Some fame.  How...  How...  Wait.  How...  Can I ask you a question?  How...  Can you...  Can you teach me to hit the post? 
[04:19:00]  Because I kind of admire what this guy...  I don't...  How long is the fucking ramp on this where I would need to talk?  Fame?  About 20 seconds or so?  Is it?  Or whatever.  Yeah.  I just feel it.  Well, I'm not good at feeling it.  Again, that would go back to listening to it before you actually...  Again.  Okay.  Can I practice a few times?  Can I try it once and then you do it?  Because you'll do it better than I will.  Oh, everybody does their own thing.  All right.  Let Jimmy do it first.  I have fame.  Irene Cara.  It's a birthday.  So you look a little something up about her, right?  Birthday.  Okay.  54 today.  All right.  She's in the movie Fame. 
[04:19:30]  She also sang the song from that.  Jimmy knows who Irene Cara is.  Sure.  Flash dance.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  This is one by Irene Cara.  You might remember her from Fame while she was crying with her ugly tits out.  The guy told her to suck her thumb.  Remember that?  And Bruno wanted to really fuck her and he never got to.  And then she was in DC Cab.  She got picked up by Charlie Burnett.  He died of AIDS in real life.  It's kind of sad.  Here it is. 
[04:20:00]  Oh, you hit a ramp, though.  This is the wrong version.  No, this is the wrong version.  That's okay.  But you did hit the ramp.  It's the wrong version.  She should have started singing that.  You're exactly right.  He had it.  He sure did.  Old fucking candy corn tits.  Played the wrong version, Travis.  I was ramping up.  I played the one that was on the Fame soundtrack.  I was ramping up old candy corn tits.  You want the other one?  Yeah, let Dennis...  Dennis, your shift is over.  You're out of here.  Here's your last song.  Mention her candy corn tits. 
[04:20:30]  Yeah, can you mention that at least?  No.  We'll see if we can work that in because I've got some other stuff to mention.  All right.  All right.  All right.  He's not going to touch that.  SiriusXL, I tell you, I've had a blast reliving the past for you today as we reach  back in time.  But of course, if you're into the movie Dancing with the Stars, the TV show Dancing with the  Stars, I should say, season 16.  I recovered.  It's live radio.  You can recover.  Season 16.  Can you believe that?  Season 16 tonight.  Check it out.  In the meantime, and in between time, let's go back to 1979 with Irene Cara and Fame. 
[04:21:00]  Jesus.  That's live radio.  You can recover.  You did recover.  You recovered well.  And another thing about recovering, never say, excuse me, calls attention that you made  a mistake.  Who cares, though?  Just go on.  I love it.  It's such great advice.  It really is.  We can learn something from Dennis Falcone.  Little things.  It's been a pleasure.  I notice you smile when you talk.  Yeah, because I'm happy.  But I mean, that affects a happy voice. 
[04:21:30]  Well, that's like when you do a live promotion, a broadcast, right?  I'm sure when you guys are out on location, you're there smiling at people.  Yes, as we're getting into the van to go home.  Being rid of these fucking mutants.  You guys have to spin.  If you spin the wheel of prizes, people have a good time.  You know, I smile during a live event when I can hear Opie and Anthony in the next room  on the air, and I'm getting jerked off in a bathroom.  That's where I'm smiling.  Dennis, that's never happened to me at a live promotion.  That's because I was giving away t-shirts and koozies. 
[04:22:00]  Right, right.  Thank you, Dennis.  Hey, Carrey, I wanted to clip, shut my mic off.  I just don't want to take the headphones off.  Yeah, it's fine.  It's okay.  Yeah, we've got to get that button.  I've got the feedback.  You're all right with leaving the studio.  The on-air light's still on.  Take care, guys.  I've had a blast reliving the past.  Thank you.  A blast reliving the past.  Dennis Falcone.  Thank you, Dennis.  They should be paying him way more than whatever he makes.  Oh, my God.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show's Best of O.N.A.  We'll be right back.

[04:26:30]  Flavor beats fire at zoome-cigs.com.  It's the best of O and A.  The cruise ship is finally back in port.  Yes, it did dock there in Mobile, Alabama last night.  All the news crews were there.  As this thing was just chugging along at, what, six to seven knots?  Limping its way into a port, yeah.  And then the tow rope broke. 
[04:27:00]  Oh, did it? I didn't see that part.  Oh, yeah, the tow rope.  And I have a conspiracy ready.  I'm not a conspiracy guy.  Well, let's hear it.  Well, if you're a Carnival Cruises, right?  Yeah.  And you got this fucking, this shit boat  making its way to Mobile, Alabama.  The shit boat!  And you got the news crews waiting, right?  Yeah.  And what they're showing is a lot of passengers  coming off the boat, interviewing with the news,  and they're smiling, they're laughing, 
[04:27:30]  they're talking about, you know, it wasn't fun,  it wasn't a cruise, but they made doo-doo.  They made doo, they had fun in some way, shape, or form,  and the news was so fucking pissed off  that they didn't have crying, horrifically disappointed  and sad passengers.  When I was watching, I think it was Wolf Blitzer,  because the people from the ship were getting their phones charged.  What was the situation room?  It was in the situation room.  And they were getting their cell phones charged, 
[04:28:00]  so then they're finally making phone calls to the media,  and Wolf Blitzer got one on.  It's like, oh, man, and he describes, like,  there's sewage in the hallway, you know, sloshing around.  Sloshing, a lot of sloshing.  People are eating onion sandwiches and this and that, right?  And the smell, and he gets a guy on,  and the guy's like, well, Wolf, tell you the truth, you know,  it's not that bad.  We're making do, and everyone's been cooperating and working together.  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.  And you could see it in his eyes, like he wants to fire a producer  for getting the wrong person.  Exactly.  He got someone that completely could, you know, handle the situation. 
[04:28:30]  They showed a lot of people coming off the boat.  There was a big, like, cheer that went off.  Everyone was like, woo!  And you see people coming down the gangway.  Apparently, they were all in robes.  Right.  And they were speculating that it was cold in Mobile that night.  And I'm just thinking that people figured they would take everything.  Like, take the fucking ride.  That's a nice robe.  Fuck it, I'm taking the robe.  I'm taking the towels.  I'm taking the...  Or they got shit pants on.  Do you think they had their shit pants?  They had duty stains on the back of their clothes. 
[04:29:00]  They must have stunk four days without a shower.  No brushing your teeth.  Just walking around in shit.  What do you think the cruise line will do for these people?  Nothing.  Well, the disaster PR is the fact that we all know that that ship was filled with shit.  Some people might have liked it.  Imagine it was a scat lover's cruise.  It's just that they loved it.  This is the greatest weekend ever.  I'm going on another one of these.  Some shit fan actually went and started the fire.  Because he wanted his wife to have to shit in his face. 
[04:29:30]  Look at this.  Everyone's smiling and laughing.  Oh, they're all in their robes, clapping and having a good time.  Yeah.  Look at them.  But the news were, they were hoping.  They have bed sheets with little signs written on them, draped over the side of the ship.  They're having a pisser.  And a shitter.  How many of those bars do you think are still intact?  Oh, man.  Right.  I think they broke into everything.  I think they did.  Yeah.  They just broke it.  Did they start breaking into shit?  Booze and food.  Yeah, I'm sure it was fucking like anarchy. 
[04:30:00]  I would love to take a tour of the ship.  Look at that.  They're showing bedding out in the hallways.  Mm-hmm.  Tent city.  The toilets were overflowing in the rooms.  So the rooms themselves were really stinking.  And people were going out into the hallway.  All those mattresses that they're showing were stained.  How the fuck are they going to clean that?  I mean, that shit is going to go into every nook and cranny.  They got to clean that shit up?  How?  I don't know.  Going to have to rip up every carpet.  Bring in the wolf.  Bring in the wolf.  Now, sop up all those pieces of shit and piss. 
[04:30:30]  It doesn't have to be perfect, but...  And I heard they were putting them on buses and driving them to New Orleans or something.  Was that true?  I heard it was like a two-hour bus ride.  Yeah, they needed a bigger airport with more options.  Yeah, they needed more options for where people were going to go.  But imagine boarding a bus for two hours now.  Yeah.  And then finally getting into that hotel room and taking that hot shower.  First thing I would do is brush my teeth.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah. 
[04:31:00]  I wonder if somebody went into the bus bathroom and took a bad shit and stunk the whole bus out.  How bad would that be?  The people are like, Jesus Christ, I can't get away from this guy.  They make a rule on the bus.  Look, people, no more shitting.  Enough with the shitting.  We've all had it.  Hold your duties.  Big nice fucking lobster and onion sandwich shits.  Nice crab cake dump.  Crab cake and fucking warm milk dump.  What's worse than a crab cake dump?  Yuck.  Yeah, and everyone must have had horrendous breath. 
[04:31:30]  They're hitting on onion sandwiches.  Yeah.  And you can't brush your teeth for four days.  Oh, wow.  Loud shits.  And you know how a loud shit must sound in a bag?  You fucking gotta have your wife hold a bag while you...  Honey, could you hold the bag?  Yeah, you're supposed to be on a conga line right now.  Come on, y'all.  You're getting it on my knuckles.  Just those loud, awful ones. 
[04:32:00]  They're doing a conga line with one person conga-ing the other behind them with a bag.  They're all just shitting on the deck.  My asshole's hot, hot, hot.  That would be wonderful.

Oh, no?  Do you ever remember an inside joke you had that just makes you cringe?  Oh, no.  What now, Jimmy?  When we were in my friend's pool. 
[04:37:30]  I love Jimmy's stories.  That's embarrassing.  Well, I was young.  I was a teenager.  All right.  I don't know how these lyrics came up.  It was a bunch of private jokes that we just made into a song.  Yeah.  It was so stupid.  It was somewhere over my big toe.  I'll find hair in puberty, says my mother.  You did not do that.

[04:43:00]  Hey, Bert. What's up, brother?  How are you guys doing?  There he is.  Hey, man.  What the fuck is this?  Take a seat there, Bert.  Oh, Juice? Thanks, Roland.  Hey, you last night.  Oh.  Obviously, you're...  Hey, Roland. Why is your voice down all gravelly?  I don't know.  I don't know!  Jets, Jets!  Jets, Jets, Jets!  Jets, Jets.  You wore that shirt just the other day?  I did a Nagel. I woke up at 7.  Oh, shit.  Oh, there he is.  A Nagel.  Yeah.  Did your alarm screw up, or did you lose power, or both? 
[04:43:30]  I did exercise for the first time in 20 years, and this fat ass passed out.  What'd you do?  Wow!  The bite.  You know people die from that, right?  No.  Yeah.  Like, not working it up 20 years.  And then you just start working out.  Yeah, you gotta start swarrowing.  You gotta start swarrowing.  That's how the heart attack happens at the gym.  I remember.  Because it knocks some of that plaque off your arteries, and then plugs some shit up.  I went home, passed out, then woke up at 7, like 7.10, 7.15.  Wow.  You beat the shit out of yourself.  You literally passed out and then woke back up? 
[04:44:00]  Like, your body did a snooze alarm on you?  Yeah, and I just woke up, and then...  Which means you're not working out anytime soon, huh?  You're gonna have to take a couple days off now.  I don't feel sore.  I feel, like, more refreshed.  I slept in.  That's fantastic.  Oh, because of the sleep part, not the workout part.  Yeah, that's perfect.  That's perfect.  Roland tweeted me last night.  I was with, uh, you guys know Cowhead, right?  Yes.  I was with Cowhead drinking, and, uh...  Is he here in New York?  Yeah, he just left this morning.  How old is he doing up here? 
[04:44:30]  He came up to see me do Letterman.  Oh, what, you guys are old friends?  Yeah, I've known Cowhead since, uh...  He's a good guy, man.  For a really long time.  He should have came by and said hi to him.  He was going to.  He was gonna change his flight, and then he was like, ah, he's gotta go back and do radio this afternoon.  How was Letterman?  It was awesome, dude.  It was so surreal.  It's so bizarre when you get him to laugh and do a Dave-ism.  Like, when he does that, like, smirk to camera, like...  Like, one of those.  And you're sitting there.  Like, when I sat...  I literally, when I sat down on the thing, I started giggling. 
[04:45:00]  Because I was like, holy shit, this is really fucking happening.  Yeah.  Like, you just...  It's such a benchmark in your career.  The first time.  Yeah.  That is a fucked up thing.  And he does one of his bits.  And you get him to do one of his bits.  Yeah.  He's like, ah, you're one of these guys, huh?  And you're like, fuck!  Holy shit!  He's doing that to me!  What the fuck is going on?  Yeah, it's like being...  It's like fucking a porn star.  And then being like, oh my god, I'm really gonna blow a loader in a chest!  That's probably a bad analogy that Travel Channel would hate, but that's exactly what it feels like.  I know what the hell.  When you're standing in the back there, and he's like, ah, ladies and gentlemen, our next guest... 
[04:45:30]  And all the guys that you've seen as characters on the show, the black guy, and the guy with the red hair, and you're like, holy shit, they're real!  They really have jobs!  I know, that's fucked up, man!  It's so bizarre!  And then you walk out and you think, how am I gonna walk?  Should I look at the audience and wave?  Yeah, should I do it?  Oh, exactly!  Oh, fuck, exactly!  It's like, Jim is the perfect body of this moment.  It's so fucked up!  Is that you're very real in those, like, I'm not famous, but I should wave to the people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah!  You embody that, because you're very honest about that moment. 
[04:46:00]  But a lot of guys are like, bullshit.  Like, a lot of guys would go out and be like, hey!  Like, paparazzi was waiting outside.  Yeah, yeah.  And I got out of my car in a white t-shirt that I was sweating in.  And a fucking jeans.  And they're like, hey, turn here!  And I was like, you don't want to fucking see me.  You're waiting for Shia LaBeouf.  So I walked out, and I just walked out like a fucking serial killer right to the chair and sat down.  Nice.  And then you sit down, and for some reason, I was compelled when I sat down to just go,  hey, Dave!  Yeah!  Like, it's like, hey, Dave!  Did you want to look at Paul?  And go, hey, Paul!  Yeah, yeah! 
[04:46:30]  I don't want to see that shit!  All you realize you're doing is an imitation of everyone you've seen.  Dude, it's hilarious.  You're just like the A-listers that do the show.  Yeah, exactly!  It's like, yeah, I earned this, motherfucker!  I earned this!  When inside, you're like, you don't want me to be on that couch.  And then it wraps, and then it wraps, and you're done, and you want to lean over and have the moment where...  Have that talk where it's like, the music's playing, they're going to commercials.  I think I did that just to make it look like that, because the people at home, they don't know. 
[04:47:00]  So you lean over, and you're like, hey, so you're going to commercial, huh?  Just to make it look that way.  And I did realize all I was doing was an imitation of everyone I've seen on Carson, on Letterman...  Just mimic it.  Mimicking from when I was a kid.  We had to walk out, and there were tennis balls all over the fucking stage.  I saw you got y'all's appearance.  Man, a while.  Oh, yeah.  And we dressed up in suits.  That was the one thing they were like, what are you going to wear?  When Cal Head called me, he was like, do not wear a fucking suit.  Don't wear a fucking suit.  You've never worn a suit in your life.  He's like, go like you're on stage. 
[04:47:30]  Wear a t-shirt, jeans, and your boots.  And I was like, yeah.  So I packed it, and my wife's like, who the fuck do you think you are, Johnny Depp?  She was like, get a collared fucking shirt, and pack a collared fucking shirt.  You slob.  What are you doing?  I showed up with four collared shirts, because I was like, I don't know which one will look good.  Oh, I was such an amateur.  No, who loves you over there is Justin loves you.  Oh, Justin's an ass.  Justin's emailing me.  He's like, you have to have Burt on the show.  I'm like, we're going to have Burt on the show.  Relax.  Justin was amazing.  This is a good fit for us, Burt.  I met him through Cal. 
[04:48:00]  Yeah, he's very cool.  Oh, one of the fucking greatest guys.  Him and his brother.  Yeah.  Solid dudes.  They told me, they're like, so these are the talking points that you're going to do.  Bizarre.  Like, Travel Channel's very, I can think I can say whatever I want on this show.  Yes, you can.  On this show, yeah.  They're very micromanaging me, because I'm a little bit of a media nightmare.  Like, I have a horrible digital footprint.  Like, my first meeting with the president, she was like, I typed in your name and I saw  you get your asshole waxed.  And I was like, yeah, yeah, that's my funniest thing I've ever done. 
[04:48:30]  And she was like, yeah, well, we're not, that's not us.  We don't do that.  Wait, why did you get your asshole waxed?  It was a long time ago.  I had a show called Hurt Burt.  And I took, I take Dangerous Man's Jobs, and that was like what got the show.  I got a full Brazilian wax.  It's maybe the funniest thing I've ever done.  And it's before Jackass.  It's before all of that.  You did Ball Bag?  Yeah, I did the whole thing.  Wow.  I'm telling you when I say this, it's the funniest thing I've ever done.  But it's also when segments were seven minutes on TV.  So it's like a five minute segment.  Fuck that.  So, but, so I get there, and the producer, Mike's like doing a conference call in the 
[04:49:00]  morning, and he's like, he's like, so we want you to tell about the time you robbed a train  in Russia.  We want you to tell you about the time that you fought a bear.  We want to tell you about the time that you went to Disneyland and took acid.  And then maybe we'll talk about the show.  And I can see the PR people going, what the fuck?  Just talk about the show.  Yeah, yeah, just the show.  And like, and so I get there, and I'm like, man, there's a lot of material.  And they're like, it's going to be nine minutes.  And I was like, holy shit.  And then Shia LaBeouf goes along, and they're like, well, it depends.  It's however long Dave wants.  But I was so nervous, I had to tell all these stories that I've never, like, on national 
[04:49:30]  television, and then Dave just fucking so comfortable.  He's like, oh, he made it.  He must have been loving it.  Can you tell us one of those stories?  Because we didn't get to watch Letterman last night.  I didn't tell any of them.  I just told.  Oh, you didn't?  No, I ended up not.  We just ended up talking about the show.  Why did you jump, Bert?  I read that you jumped out of the, my extra friend did that, where you jump off the thing  in Vegas.  I was the first person to do it.  Really?  Yeah, I was the very first person to do it.  Before we go there, I want to hear.  I had the guinea pig.  Hold on.  Before we go there, though, I want to hear about you robbing a train in Russia.  That's crazy. 
[04:50:00]  Because then we'll get into the show and all this crazy shit you've done as Bert the  Conqueror.  Like, I want to know more about Bert.  I'll tell you.  It's so fucking bizarre.  Because I've heard this show so many times, and you always think, like, what will it be  like with the first time I'm there?  And then you're like, oh, fuck, I guess I'm telling this Russian mob story.  So I was in, I was, I studied Russian in college, just on a fluke.  I thought it was a Spanish class.  And showed up at noon, and they were introduced to a different alphabet. 
[04:50:30]  And I was like, what the fuck?  You come across as a party animal.  How the fuck did you take Russian?  I was the number one person in the country.  I, like, Rolling Stone magazine wrote an article about me, called me the number one party animal  in the country.  So, yeah, I was, I'm not fucking, by any stretch of the means, wanted to learn the language.  I just wanted a C.  And the lady said, I need 14 people to take the class.  If you stick around and just show up, I'll let you fucking get a C.  I was like, done.  A C?  Fucking done.  It's Florida State.  Fucking phone that shit in.  So, I ended up taking, I had to take four seasons of Russian, because all the kids that 
[04:51:00]  took it with me, took it with Russian one, then needed Russian two, and three, and four.  And then they go to Russia, and they're like, fuck.  So, this is back when the mob ran Russia, okay?  And so, they told me on the flight over there, like, listen, we had to pay off the mob to  chaperone us, so that we don't get patted down everywhere we go.  So, we got two young gangsters that we'll meet.  They're like, don't make eye contact with them.  Don't engage them.  Don't fucking, and nothing.  Leave them alone.  They're just to make sure we don't get robbed everywhere we go.  Oh, fuck, man.  And all I'm hearing is fucking, let's get to know these guys. 
[04:51:30]  These are the guys who I want to party with.  So, the very first night, and I don't speak any Russian, the very first night, I got a  bottle of vodka, a six-pack of Baltica, and I knock on their door, and this guy Igor answers  the door.  Igor, yeah.  With just a wife beater and a cigarette and fucking track pants, total gangster.  And he's like, shh, and I'm like, I'm like, all the sentences I had practiced in  my head just disappeared, and all I said with a bottle of vodka and a six-pack of Baltica  was, I am the machine.  That's all that came out of my mouth. 
[04:52:00]  And he fucking starts laughing.  He's like, what did you say?  And I was like, I don't know, I'm the machine?  And he's like, he's the machine!  And then I ended up partying with him and all his friends for like an entire, like two  months, just, and they called me the machine.  And so, I mean, we partied like crazy.  These, fuck, we go to, we went to a, I really shouldn't tell this part, but we went to like  a mob boss's party, and the mob boss was like, I mean, I don't know if he was a real boss,  but he was a big guy on the thing, and he was like, so this is the machine, and Igor  was like, yeah, this is the guy I tell you about. 
[04:52:30]  And I was with one of my teachers, who was the girl, and he goes, tonight, I say we exchange  women.  And I was like, women?  She's just my, okay, alright, sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever you mean, man.  And he totally ended up fucking up.  Whatever you mean.  He totally ended up fucking up.  So, so then, we have to go to Moscow.  Now, a different mob runs the trains, and a different mob runs Moscow.  And Igor said, I can't go with you to Moscow, I can't even get on the train with you, but  I've talked to the people that are going to be chaperoning you, and they're cool.  They're going to party with you, they'll take care of you. 
[04:53:00]  And sure enough, man, we get to the train, and then two other gangsters, Igor and Igor,  there are not a lot of names there, I guess, but these are their real names, are there,  and he's like, this is the machine.  If you give the machine vodka, you'll have a blast.  And they're like, machine does not sit and coach with his class, the machine sits first  class.  I'm like, this is what I'm fucking talking about.  The machine.  And, I mean, literally, before we took off, the conductor of the train comes into our  cabin, rips off the lapel to his shirt, hands it to me, and goes, this is a present for  the machine, it would be an honor to do a shot with you.  I was like, these stories have gotten out of control. 
[04:53:30]  So, within 20 minutes, we drank all the booze, and Igor and Igor were like, let's go to the  bar cart and get more vodka.  I was like, sure.  So, we go into the bar cart, and Big Igor's like, machine, go behind the bar and grab bread.  And I was at Kleb, and I'm like, oh shit, I understood what he said.  He's like, grab seer.  And I was like, that's cheese.  He's like, grab vodka.  I'm like, I know that one.  I'm learning.  And then he's like, grab all the money.  And I'm like, what?  Oh shit, wait a minute.  He's like, grab the money.  And I look, and no one's fucking moving.  And it's just him patting down people.  And I'm behind the bar with a fucking loaf of bread, a bottle of vodka. 
[04:54:00]  And I just, I'm like, holy shit, we're robbing the fucking train.  So, we take the money, and we go back to first class.  And it is, the energy has changed in these guys' eyes.  You can see it's like an, they're real gangsters.  Now it's business.  Like, Igor was a pity pat gangster.  These guys, I mean, our teacher came back to yell at me, this lady Val.  She came back, and she was like, you sir, have, this is, this is exactly, that was inappropriate.  Big Igor takes a sip of vodka, spits in her face, and goes, no one talks to the machine like that.  The machine, she's like, I'm like, she does, it's okay, she does. 
[04:54:30]  He shuts the door, I swear to you, he then lifts up a thing of keys, and he goes, tonight  when it gets dark, we're gonna have some real fun.  I was like, what?  And he's like, we're robbing the whole fucking train.  I'm like, motherfucker, like, this has gotten way out of control.  And sure enough, man, it gets dark, and we start fucking breaking into cabins.  It's like a Bond movie.  It's the most insane fucking event in my life, where you're just sitting watching a crime happen,  and you're like, I'm trying, I wish I could stop it, but you're just part of it now.  So we get done, we drink the whole night on the train, we pull into Moscow, and that  same teacher comes up, and she's like, the police have been alerted, we've told the authorities,
