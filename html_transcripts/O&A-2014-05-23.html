<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a bizarre segment titled "Sperm Bowl 96," a competition between Opie and Anthony to determine who had the higher sperm count.  The original, vaguely remembered bet involved crashing a car, but the current stakes were a case of beer.  Lab technician Don Newton oversaw the process, which involved stopwatches, specimen cups, and a microscope.  The hosts recounted past stunts like "cherry darts" and "Fake Cory" while employing excessive vulgar language and sexual innuendo.  Several callers chimed in, with one memorably calling them "two guys sitting in the studio playing with themselves." Anthony left the studio to provide his sample, and the results were discussed upon his return, revealing Anthony as the winner due to a significantly higher sperm count than Opie.  Opie's difficulty in producing his sample (17.5 minutes compared to Anthony's 11.15 minutes) provided further comedic fodder, with graphic descriptions and jokes punctuating the segment.

Following the sperm count reveal, the hosts transitioned into a discussion about their discovery of audio tapes from a 1970-71 underground radio show hosted by "Dave Rabbit" from a Saigon whorehouse in Vietnam.  The show, a mix of hard rock, crude humor, and on-air drug use, had inexplicably gained a massive following years later through internet sharing. The hosts played several clips, showcasing Rabbit's unique style and commentary. They then connected with Dave Rabbit via phone, who detailed the show's origins, its location, the reasons for its creation and its abrupt end due to military pressure.  Rabbit also discussed his subsequent career hiatus and recent return to broadcasting with the ATS Mix show, a podcast focusing on conspiracy theories.  His podcast, hosted on Above Top Secret.com, was described as "Disneyland for nuts."  Further clips from Rabbit's Vietnam broadcasts were played, featuring irreverent humor, profanity, and commentary on Nixon, George Wallace, and Tiny Tim.

The show then featured a recording of Alabama state representative Alvin Holmes giving an incoherent speech about raising the legal alcohol limit for beer, characterized by repeated phrases like "What's wrong with the beer we got? It drank pretty good, don't it?".  This was followed by a discussion about a 16-year-old Australian who threw a massive party, and a television interview with the teenager who refused to remove his glasses.  More audio from Representative Holmes' speech on bonds and his opposition to the alcohol bill was then played.

Next, the hosts discussed a viral video of a 16-year-old Australian boy, Corey, who hosted a destructive party.  They played clips from his interview with an Australian news reporter, highlighting his defiant and unapologetic attitude. However, a shocking twist was revealed:  the interview was with an impersonator, contacted through a fake MySpace page created as a prank. The pranksters called in, explaining their actions and the unexpected success of their hoax. The hosts expressed their embarrassment at being duped, playing more clips of the impersonator's interview.

The broadcast then included commercial breaks for Instaflex, Husqvarna, Paychex, and other products. This was followed by a highly offensive conversation with a guest, "Billy," who the hosts and Patrice repeatedly accused of being responsible for the crack cocaine epidemic in the Black community, inventing AIDS, and being involved in Illuminati conspiracies.  The conversation included graphic language, racist remarks, and unsubstantiated claims about hidden symbolism on US currency. The discussion shifted to one-man shows, with Patrice O'Neal expressing his dislike, and anecdotes about Broadway shows. A phone call with a Freemason further fueled conspiracy theories and offensive humor.  The show concluded with additional commercials.  A final brief advertisement for Engineering for Kids on SiriusXM channel 4 and its app was aired.

[00:03:00]  Radio supremacy.  Highlighting bit after bit.  Guest after guest.  And mess after mess.  Such memories as cherry darts.  Fake Cory.  Tippy Tom.  Dice.  Pendulum is swinging.  Intern David.  Baby diaper mustache.  Rhi Olsen.  Raw vomit.  Some of them other beers we got.  This is the best of Opie and Anthony in 2008.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  FU Friday in progress.  What do you got there?  I got the official stopwatch for Sperm Bowl 96.  That's for the secondary bet that we got going.  Yes, we're going to find out who has the higher sperm count.  The loser has to get in a car and crash into a wall with an airbag.  No way.  What?  No.  Somebody did that.  By the way, wait.  What the fuck?  Where did that come from?  And you're wrong.  The winner would be the one who crashed into the wall without airbag. 
[00:04:00]  Dude, no fucking way.  We were, we were, I don't, why don't I remember that?  I'm officially uncomfortable.  Because you have a concussion from crashing in a wall.  The loser.  But we goofed on, on that bit when, when it was done by another.  Mancow?  Yeah.  And turd.  The loser had to.  That's a big, that's a big risk.  We didn't actually do that, did we?  Did we take like a, I really don't know. 
[00:04:30]  I really don't know.  I certainly hope not.  Don't put it past yourselves, you've got to put a helicopter.  I mean, a bullet.  That's too easy to fake this one on the ground.  We're in an unmarked van going to an unmarked car to a discreet wall.  But it will be marked after I smash a vehicle into it.  Is it marked?  Absolutely yes.  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  It's an unmarked slash car with lights on it.  All right, man.  I really don't know.  Your guys' budget was incredible.  They just threw money away in those days, didn't they? 
[00:05:00]  Flimps.  Cracked cars?  Sure.  Just have them lying around?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Someone's suggesting.  This is horrible.  It's Jeff from New Jersey.  This bit is just like the other one we heard.  Two guys sitting in the studio playing with themselves.  To get in a car and crash into a wall with an airbag.  And the side bet, I know this doesn't make sense to the average listener,  but the side bet is whoever could do the deed the quickest.  Whoever gets their sample the quickest. 
[00:05:30]  Yes.  We'll get a case of beer from the other guy.  Man, this is like high stress, though.  Well, that's why we're going for the quick.  It's the same case of beer.  Oh, what?  It's high stress.  Very high stress.  It sure is.  But you know the weird thing is that, Tom.  Yeah.  There's a giant disparity in the gifts.  First prize is a case of beer.  Second prize is you never walk again.  That was my impression of what people were supposed to sound like on the radio. 
[00:06:00]  I never thought I was putting on some kind of voice,  but I guess I was trying to put on some kind of voice.  It was very new.  We actually jerked off, by the way, if people are wondering.  We didn't fake the jerking off thing.  Hope not.  Every day you came to work.  No, no, no.  That was...  Best, though.  Well, that's why we're going for the quickest,  because we've got a bunch of people with suits, you know,  trying to do business around here.  It's just a very embarrassing situation for both of us,  so we figure the guy who does it the quickest is actually winning in this situation. 
[00:06:30]  For all the fun and hijinks it is,  hey, it's a little educational.  It's very educational.  You'll get to find out how he measures it,  and, you know, what's a good count, what's a bad count.  Right.  You know, maybe we'll be helping some people  who are having fertility problems out there, Opie.  Here you go.  Right here is the official stopwatch.  Why can't I make that sound like that?  Anthony's sperm was frogs.  Why couldn't I make that sound like  I was kidding that this is helping?  I don't know.  These days, whenever we say something like, 
[00:07:00]  oh, I think we're helping the retarded by doing this,  you know we don't mean one fucking word of it.  I'm sitting here.  That actually sounded like, hey, and it's educational, people.  I'm sitting here going, will you be sarcastic for once, you fuck?  Of little pieces.  You mother hucker.  Mother hucker.  All you want is one wink.  Just, right.  That's all.  One fucking wink.  That's all I'm listening for is like,  one wink, one, we're just fucking, you know. 
[00:07:30]  It wasn't there.  Not everybody.  No.  Not only is there no winks,  but the one time where someone winks,  and you go, why'd you wink?  Oh, no, no, I didn't.  There was just something in my eye.  Yeah.  That wasn't a wink.  That wasn't a wink, or it was, yes.  Let's say hi to Larry in Connecticut.  Larry.  Larry.  Gonna find your dog dead in the hallway, Larry.  What's up, Larry?  Yep.  Fucking mother.  I want to ask Anthony if he's got more wacky, kooky stuff for us.  Linger a lot longer.  You don't like what you see. 
[00:08:00]  Get the funk out.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Because I always, what happened to George Burns?  All right, um.  Well, he sang Extreme.  Shut up.  I hate you, Jimmy.  All right, let's go back to this.  Here is the official stopwatch.  That's it.  Of Spermable 96.  We might have to stopwatch, though.  Huh?  We start when we start actually, or when we leave the studio, we got to hash this out.  It's going to be kind of like an obstacle course.  You're going to start the stopwatch in the studio. 
[00:08:30]  And then you got to run out.  And then the participant has to run down the hall with the little cup into our office, which  is on the other side of the building, so literally a couple dozen employees will have to check  us out.  We get into our office.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Come running back and we stop the watch.  Is that fair?  Yeah, but that could be a little awkward, too, man.  I can't believe this.  You got to run through the halls with a cup of that?  Yes!  Dude, this whole thing is a very embarrassing thing.  i can't believe this isn't in the olympics it's just unbelievable by the way our office was um 
[00:09:00]  it was a storage closet that's what they thought of us and our our wacky kooky radio full of cum  and t-shirts the debt our desk would be um piled up every day with new pieces of radio equipment  with reams of paper and all that shit holy mother of god well you know it's it's  i i mean over you're flabbergasted here it's it's one of those situations where you listen back and  just go what the yeah i thought you know i thought we were good i uh happened i remember this show a

[00:23:00]  it was getting a good reaction and uh it you know it was i mean i i have i don't know how i don't  know how either but the ratings were good they were happy at the station i remember all that crap right  and then somewhere along the line we found our voices because i i blame dave douglas because he  would beat us down and i think he really wants to do truly like morning zoo type of shit like at  least like this is hacky but it's kind of edgy material that the presentation sucks but to jerk off  on the air no one was doing that right so you know what i mean so it was like we're kind of like 
[00:23:30]  have a morning zoo presentation but our our bits were kind of quote edgy and dave kept beating us  down and he wanted us to do actual morning zoo bits and that's when the anger started getting  injected into into the radio show and we finally found our voices like this is what we really want  to fucking do that's what it needed was that little pinch of anger there was no anger whatsoever in  sarcasm something yeah and we found that thank god because we did have like edgy stuff we thought 
[00:24:00]  would work on a show thank god for the incompetence of dave dickless because i i read um because we  went down memory lanes uh the old uh receptionist from that station wrote us i i told well i told you  i read the the note uh to anthony this morning and she reminded she didn't remind us but she wrote in  this little memo she goes i remember you guys going into dave douglas's office every monday so i guess  we had a meeting with the program director that's hilarious why would you ever do that that'll happen 
[00:24:30]  and um never i guess we had meetings every monday that we were forced to have with him and she wrote  in this note that i read in today she goes i remember you guys leaving that office just fucking  pissed every fucking monday i never saw you guys leave that office happy once and then we'd go on  the air and make believe we give us shit yes all right here we go uh we're in the middle of sperm  bowl 1996 also known as sperm bowl 96 uh the testing procedure i don't know if mine's ready this is 
[00:25:00]  really too much man i don't know if mine's ready this is really too much man how are you gonna know  i don't know jimmy i'm smiling so much i can't even talk let me get inside anthony's brain i'm smiling  on the outside because i want to kill myself my life is driving me nuts and i don't know how to  divorce her yet i'm just weeping and weeping and it's still what is it it's still uh three years 
[00:25:30]  before i'll get out of this marriage so oh my god help me please you always gotta sound like you're  you're wrapped in an air of mirth  i don't i don't know where the fuck that comes from you were just happy go lucky  but he wasn't happy yeah but you were banging nails four months before this now you're sitting  in the studio thank god for opie's loneliness you would have never had a job obviously not there to 
[00:26:00]  contribute jesus thank god opie needed somebody else in the studio really too much man i i you know  and you talked about this a couple of months back right it all sounded fine and dandy but now that  now that zero hours here it's like how the hell am i going to go into another office through  a whole studio full of people and come out with everybody knowing exactly what i just did  and now he's got this solution here he's got test tube this looks very official and scientific in  here and what's what's the procedure uh basically we're going to mix it in two mls of saline and mix 
[00:26:30]  it up let it sit for a few minutes i'm going to put a little bit on the counting chamber and we're  going to put it on the microscope and we count there's the chamber itself is got marked off into  squares and we count the four squares do a little multiplication and uh calculate the results  you actually physically count these by eye you see them actually squirming around and  actually squirming around well what if one how what if one's hiding behind another one man  well then you just kind of oh wow well what if one sperm is you know fucking the other sperm

[00:41:30]  summed it up right there this is terrible oh my god here's opi's reaction to the coin toss  oh shit oh my god so i was that cheer could be the greatest thing i've heard in five years that 
[00:42:00]  was a phenomenal one why let's let's go to the phones  why would it matter who jerked off first i don't know but there was such a joy in it  such joy oh this is terrible oh come on come on anthony yeah yeah i get the after sex smoke faster  anthony get my picture out oh no put on some lace panties stop it stop it anthony i'll talk to you

[00:43:30]  ball 96 well there's this mouth looking thing what is that all about i have to go first what is that  all about it's about you have to go first it's not really a big mystery that you have to figure  out what it's about well what it's about dummy is that someone has to go first and you have to go  first i want to grab myself old anthony by his stupid ponytail right and i want to open his mouth put it  on the edge of the curb and stomp him like american history x i hate that be in your disguise or would 
[00:44:00]  that be that no no not my disguise how many people that's just me how many people have like old audio  themselves that they can listen to and get deuce chills not many not many deuce chills seems to be  the worst well there's this mouth looking thing that you're supposed to use menus to uh you know  and then there's a hand it's a battery-powered vibrating hand right i mean what i got one of  these so you go out and buy one dude put a pen in it yeah you can put a pen in it look it's bob dole

[01:36:30]  we're an underground radio station here and we say what we feel like saying and we bring the truth  to the first termers in the republic of vietnam  we also bring you hard acid rock music all through the night the up-to-date music of today's american youth 
[01:37:00]  i like this guy man how that's pretty cool that's not good buddy man that's like this is the real deal  man that's history how crazy is that i like that stuff guys he sounds like he has a cool voice yeah  rod sterling yeah and he just sounds high yeah oh he's probably so goddamn high yeah underground does  that mean like he ran it or he was renting space how does that work uh you know what i didn't know  anything about this guy iraq is actually helping me out um he tried to get a job on the uh armed 
[01:37:30]  force radio network he was interning there which is the good morning vietnam right right they wouldn't  let him go on the air they wouldn't let him touch any of the equipment so he just hung around and  watched how they did everything um through some uh creative trading he he got some equipment and was  renting a a room in the back of a whorehouse in vietnam and uh they tiled the studio with these uh  one inch tiles and mattresses so to kind of deaden the sound so you wouldn't hear all the sex going  on around the while they were broadcasting so it's him and two other uh servicemen are are doing their 
[01:38:00]  show in the back room and uh just transmitting first they started illegally they were tapping over  the armed force radio network signal before their um their time check and everything at eight o'clock  at seven fifty nine they were saying armed forces uh opening up a second channel flipped as uh sixty  nine on your fm dial there and uh listen to uh radio first hermer and then at eight o'clock the  the signal would hit and the uh the radio network would kick in so then everybody flipped over to 
[01:38:30]  sixty nine and started listening to this for like a year and a half did you intern for them uh because  i know you made the rounds a lot of radio stations yeah no no why did you did this is what's his name  david rabbit i like the garlic butter saw garlic butter saw here in country it's not a great story  that was underground radio man he was like telling the real truth of what what was going on uh you  know in the field this is your first time in the republic of vietnam try the garlic butter saw  and the acid yeah you want to hear a little more yeah man yeah all right there's dave rabbit a message 
[01:39:00]  from the latrine walls he used to do a bit he did but uh bits simple bits but it was called uh a message  from the latrine walls give me the information during the night we're going to be reading some of  things off of the latrine walls around the republic of vietnam no one of them while i'm home my wife is  my right hand while i'm away my right hand is my wife  cooking from the big 69 and the who the who 
[01:39:30]  wizard how cool is that as you just blast in a 50 cal over a trench right oh oh yeah wonderful yeah  i think they were trying to find this guy too he was getting way too popular they didn't want uh  uh they didn't they didn't pretty dirty for uh the the day huh yeah well there was no fcc right 
[01:40:00]  you're in the middle of nowhere of course not you want one more before the break i want many more  i love this guy this guy's got a great delivery more yeah i want to start doing that more dv  rabbit yeah let's just all talk as much like dv rabbit pinball wizard by the who  i've had quite a few letters recently uh concerning some of the different items that uh radio first  termer has to offer his followers and one of the biggest things is the official dave rabbit sweatshirt 
[01:40:30]  for those of you who are unaware of what a dave rabbit sweatshirt is i'll tell you it's a white sweatshirt  on the front of it it has a large white rabbit and the rabbit is completely the rabbit is carrying a  sign on the sign it reads it before it you if you like one of these dave rabbit sweatshirts send a 
[01:41:00]  postcard along with 298 and a rabbit sweatshirt radio saigon underground apon country nine six nine  six nine cream and the hits just keep on coming how cool is that he's my favorite radio person ever 
[01:41:30]  yeah that guy's delivery is great the material is great i've had this tape for over 20 years man  finally found in a box let me ask you a question though with this guy if he's giving out an address  and stuff like that and he's got letters how could he do that if the government wanted him gone they  would have traced him so how did that happen from what i understand um a lot of that stuff they really  uh the government was having a hard time because it would go to uh fake businesses or just farm people  like oh here's the address and then there would just be a farmhouse there and they would just drop 
[01:42:00]  the mail off at the at these places and somebody would eventually come around and pick it up oh  okay the guy was just a tech geek that figure out how to freaking do a radio show in the middle of  vietnam like a real one do we know his real name now no no we're gonna we're gonna find out more  about this guy but i guess i didn't even know that i have like gold in my uh possession because i guess  the clips on the internet are really really bad quality yeah so this is like gold tried to get a  to get this stuff clear right oh my god and yeah supposedly there's more stuff on the internet 
[01:42:30]  but it's really really bad quality in general so we're gonna take a break we'll play more from this  tape uh old school opiate anthony uh you know another thing i found as i unloaded boxes uh the  other day uh it's dave rabbit from 1970 71 somewhere around there broadcasting live from vietnam i found  this uh dave rabbit tape it's not about us today it's about this guy dave rabbit he did a underground  radio show in vietnam back in 1970 1971 that was very very different than what the government was 
[01:43:00]  putting out yeah much better than what the government was putting out oh sure well blue  adrian cronauer away yeah we all know uh vietnam radio from yeah of course good morning vietnam and  i don't feel like really screaming it but this guy was doing the complete opposite he was tripping  and just kind of just kind of talking like a real person dirty jokes oh yeah dirty jokes and all  sorts of stuff so let's go right back to the tape it's uh dave rabbit 1970 1971 and uh he talks about  taking a bathroom break here listen to this cream with white room oh he was a chatty kathy by the 
[01:43:30]  way because he was he was talking after every song i noticed oh boy would the pd have a field day with  this guy he was talking well into the song too oh i know over the vocals he didn't give a crap  that's why i love this guy breaking all the rules yeah cream with white room  white we're gonna let this next one roll on through why well for one reason i'm gonna go take a big

[02:09:30]  and we were amazed by this cassette  and no one knew anything about you  no one knew anything about the show  and we would listen to it  every once in a while  and then I got a copy of it  I just threw it in a box  and I don't know  15, 20 years go by  and all of a sudden  I'm unloading my apartment  and I find this thing  and I'm like  oh my god  I used to love this tape  and I brought it into the show  and we've been playing it  and just freaking out about it  yeah  E-Rock sent me a copy  of the show yesterday 
[02:10:00]  I wasn't available to listen to it  but yeah  you guys rock and roll brother  you really do  well you had  quite the show back then  I mean  what was it  were you  were you a pirate station  were you  taking over a signal  how did it actually work  well  I mean  it was the August version  it actually started  when I was on my second tour  in FanRang  I was associated with  a legal  AFVN  radio station  called Radio FanRang  and my roommate 
[02:10:30]  Jim Brookshire  is the one  that got me involved  as his studio engineer  and as it turned out  when I left that assignment  to go to Saigon  we had a rocket attack  that morning  that I was leaving  to go back home  on R&R  and a rocket landed  in our room  killed Jim  wow  and you know  if I had been laying there  I'd been dead too  so  it really rocked me  to my roots  because this was just  a generous 
[02:11:00]  sweet  loving guy  that would have  you know  done anything  for anybody  in humanity  and it was a senseless war  to begin with  and the fact that he was taken  angered me  tremendously  so when we got to Saigon  my mission was  to do something  that AFVN  was never going to do  or stars and stripes  and that was to bring  rock and roll  to the troops  on the front lines  and I'm talking  the army marines  the guys that were  every day  lugging through  all the swamp  and the forest 
[02:11:30]  and the trees  and all that  and that's what we did  and you know  it took us two months  in pre-production  just to get everything  together to where  we could even get on air  so you decided  you couldn't go on  to a regular radio station  how did you decide  where to broadcast from  and this was done  basically from a whorehouse  right?  yeah  I mean  Pete Savner  not his real name  was a frequent flyer  at Madam Ho's  and so anyway  he says 
[02:12:00]  I said  we need a place  and we couldn't do it  on the base  obviously  I mean  that was a little bit  of a little no-brainer  so he says  well yeah  let's go down  to Madam Ho's  and I said  okay sure  you know  and we met  Madam Ho  and offered her  gave her  one of those  Vito Corleone things  you know  an offer she couldn't refuse  basically was  she got to keep  the mattresses  and all the equipment  when we got through  kind of barter situation  you know  well they set up  the studio by  I should just jump in  real fast  they set up  the studio 
[02:12:30]  by lining the room  with mattresses  and stuff  to keep out  the outside noises  keep out the moanings  that is going on  down the hall  there was a lot  of that too brother  yeah  man  so you set up  in this whorehouse  and how long  did you have  actually do the show for  we only  we lasted 21 days  mainly because  we didn't want  to go to Long Den  which was the prison  in Vietnam  they were really  after us  the base commander  I don't know  whether you played  that little snippet yet 
[02:13:00]  but the base commander  was not a big fan  of Radio First  Tramor  or Dave Rabbit  he made it a vow  to find me  and you know  toss my rabbit  buttocks  into the prison system  and I guess  you know  there was something  about the prison life  that just didn't  appeal to me  so even though  we had military  police and officers  and lifers  that were actually  protecting us  you know  we had to shut it down  it was just no way  we could have 
[02:13:30]  continued on  more than 21 days  and so we demolished  everything  you know  we gave the equipment  to Madam Ho  and then we got rid  of everything  burned everything  where there was no trace  that connected us  to the show  and we walked out  the back door  of Madam Ho's house  and you know  and never looked back  yeah you were  you were saying  some ballsy stuff  for back then  and for being  in the military  especially  and broadcasting  to the military  I'm sure they didn't 
[02:14:00]  really enjoy  some of the stuff  you were saying  about the lifers  and the brass  and what not  well you know  I mean  the officers  I mean there was  there's always  a percentage of them  that couldn't  take a joke  as well as  the lifers  but you would be  real surprised  how many huge  fans we had  that were in  the officer ranks  as well as  the top military  ranks of the  you know  the regular  stripers  so you did this  radio show  for three weeks  and were you 
[02:14:30]  surprised that the  tapes had gone out  all over the world  I'll tell you  what really blew me  away  I mean as I say  we walked out  on the 21st of  January of 71  and never looked  back  in the summer  of 1982  I'm at a party  here in Dallas  and I'm talking  to this guy  and we're just  shooting the breeze  and it turns out  he was in the army  in Germany  we spot in Germany  and he said  well what did you do  I said I was in  Vietnam  he said hey  did you ever hear  a Dave rabbit 
[02:15:00]  I said yeah  and he goes  well man  he says  that guy really  ruled  did you listen  to him live  I said yeah  I really did  and then one  thing led to  another  and I said  well you're not  going to believe  this but I'm  Dave rabbit  and he goes  nah you're not  Dave rabbit  and so I did  you know  I remembered  a couple of  the bits  you know  about the  toothpick in the  toilet  and the crabs  pole vaulting  and so I  kind of did  and he says 
[02:15:30]  oh my god  and he actually  hits the floor  and starts  bowing down  to me  and I'm going  what is all  this about  he says  man  he says  you're a legend  in Germany  and I'm going  how am I a legend  in Germany  because I'm thinking  you know  the last show  we did was the  21st of January  71  this is 82  how can I be  a legend  in Germany  and then  that's when I  found out  that somebody  recorded one  of the shows  and I have a  good idea  that it was  the radio relay  guys that were  bumping our  signal throughout 
[02:16:00]  Cambodia  Laos  and the  southeast states  all illegally  by the way  that took goals  on their part  yeah  and that's  when I first  found out  that a show  existed  and you know  February 9th  2006  I get on the  internet  the kids  want to know  stuff about  Vietnam  and I'm  you know  googling  which I never  do  I hate to  google  well  occasionally  on Friday  nights  I like googling  but only if I  have a bar  so anyway  so what happens  is that 
[02:16:30]  I get on the  internet  and I find  this site  that says  audio clips  from Vietnam  and I'm thinking  okay cool  and I see  when it says  radio first  term  well I click  on it  then I find  Will Snyder's  site  who created  the original  Dave Rabbit  home  and get on  that and see  that he's had  these clips  and then I start  googling and find  above top secret  dot com  which is my  family right now  that I have  with the ATS  mix show  and then one  thing leads to  another 
[02:17:00]  and it's just  been a crazy  crazy ride  it really  has  yeah  because  I mean  when I found  out you only  did 21 shows  that amazed  me  obviously  the people  that taped  these things  thought it was  so unusual  and so different  and so cool  that they obviously  wanted to trade  them and give  them to other  people  and then that's  where this whole  thing grew  because no one  gets popular  from doing 21  radio shows  no one  well  I did  no no  I understand  that  but  that means  live 
[02:17:30]  like it's  all  Dave  that was  actually a  compliment  like no one  just does  21 shows  and that's  it  I mean  you obviously  had something  you were  basically  you basically  had the voice  of the soldiers  that's why  they can relate  to you  and that's  why this  thing  becomes a  phenomenon  because they're  like wow  you gotta hear  this tape  we all remember  when we were  a lot younger  if we heard  something really  cool  you could say  jerky boys  or whatever  you wanted  to pass  this tape  on to others  and that's  how this  whole thing  ended up  just becoming 
[02:18:00]  huge  yeah  and it's  one of those  things  where you  know  you get  something  you pass  it on  to a buddy  and that kind  of thing  and that's  really how  it grew  I mean  conservatively  we have  23 million  military and  civilian fans  worldwide right now  I mean  strictly from  them finding  the internet  finding the  stuff on the  websites and  stuff  and strictly  passing it  on to  somebody  that gives  you a great  idea of how  grassroots movements  can really be 
[02:18:30]  very effective  right  what did you do  when you came  back from  Vietnam  what happened  with your life  did you do  radio  did you pursue  it at all  no  and here's  the weird  thing  I came back  home  my family  had a business  here in Dallas  my dad and mom  were not of the  best health  and so I took  that over  and kind of  put my radio  career on hold  and then when  I got involved  with above  top secret  dot com  and my  my partners  Simon Gray  Mark Allen  Stephen Melzer  Bill Irwin  and of course  my partner  Johnny Anonymous  we started 
[02:19:00]  this the  ATS Mix  show about  eight months  ago  and started  doing a  podcast  and then  you know  one thing  led to another  and the show  got real popular  and we got  huge fan base  going  and now  as I told  E-Rock  yesterday  we're on  the verge  of going  nationwide  syndication  in the next  three or four  months  so it's a  pretty amazing  ride  37 years  later  but  yeah  so you  walk away  from radio  37 years  ago  which  obviously  you had  the passion  to do it  that had  to kill  you  and you 
[02:19:30]  only got  back into  it eight  months ago  well actually  yeah  I started  we started  the show  eight months  ago  right  and you  didn't do  any radio  in between  for the most  part  no  oh my god  that's amazing  what kind  of work  did you do  well I  you know  I don't want  to tell  too much  about that  because everybody  I'll be going  on the doors  I sold my  business actually  last May  and decided  to do this  full time  and I took  a leap of faith  I figured  you know  if I'm going  to do this  at 59  boys 
[02:20:00]  I know  you were  using your  calculator  trying to  figure out  how old  I am  but at 59  I figured  you know  if I'm going  to do it  I've got to  go do it  now  so I sold  my business  and really  turned my back  but basically  to answer  your question  it was just  a business  that was  in marketing  I was in  marketing  in a general  degree  have you  kept your  identity  private  for all  these years  about who  Dave Rabbitfield  named  oh yeah  in fact  when I went  to above  top secret  dot com  originally  when I 
[02:20:30]  googled it  and I  thought  what  the heck  is  above  top  secret  dot com  and I  click  and this  guy  by the name  of John  Jeremiah  and his  post is  still there  on the  site  he thinks  I'm a  conspiracy  theory  of the  government  and that  the  United States  government  put me  in Saigon  to you know  for some  kind of war  effort  kind of thing  and I'm  thinking  this is  nuts  this is  crazy  and from  that you  know  a love  affair  began  between  me  and above  top  secret  dot com  because  I lovingly 
[02:21:00]  call it  Disneyland  for nuts  but boy  it's just  so much  more than  that you  know  yeah  it looked  like you  guys  were having  a great  time  why  would you  why  do you  keep it  why  do you  not  want to  reveal  who  you  are  well  one  reason  is  that  you  know  my  wife  bunny  and  my  son  Jack  and  Peter  and of course  Babs and  Bugs  you know  it's amazing  how many  people  will see me  on the street  and they don't  have a clue  who I am  see I like  going in my  life in  stealth mode 
[02:21:30]  I kind of  like that  I don't know  who you  really are  well you  know  I mean  that's  the mystique  about it  if everybody  knew  you know  that  you know  I'm  really  you know  George  Stephanopoulos  with ABC  radio  I mean  that would  really blow  the whole  thing  you know  I mean  they just  didn't identify  with that  it's actually  Rush Limbaugh's  alter ego  I love that  so you're doing  this show  every night  with your  pals and stuff  and every  day  you're  thinking  this is  going to  be the  last show  there's  no way  I could  keep  this  going  right  oh 
[02:22:00]  well  you know  every day  was a  gamble  I mean  it really  was  because  I mean  they were  trying to  fight us  with triangulations  and all kinds  of stuff  and it was  really impossible  for them to do  it because  of the radio  relay guys  I mean  we were on  three hours  only  you know  during that  window of  opportunity  so  I mean  they tried  I mean  they tried  real hard  but here's  why we  stopped  the military  police  the OSI  Office of  Special  Investigation  in the  military  these guys  a lot 
[02:22:30]  of them  were our  friends  they knew  about us  they were  encouraging  the show  to get  on the air  so  when they  got to a  point  where their  supervisors  were saying  look  there's no  reason in the  world  that you're  not finding  these guys  unless you're  implicated  with them  and they  started getting  a lot of  pressure  and I'll  never forget  it as long  as I live  a very good  friend of mine  in the OSI  office  comes up to  me and says  Dave you gotta  stop  he says  because  if you don't  we're all  gonna go  down 
[02:23:00]  and I  said  okay  that's it  and that's  when we  stopped  so they  protected you  for as long  as they  could  until it  was obvious  they were  protecting you  yep  wow that's an  amazing story  and you come  back and you live  your life  you go 37  years and you  start up again  and do you  know that there  were so many  recordings of  your show  floating around  like different  shows or did  you only have  one copy  yourself  well you know  we found a  reel to reel  that was some  trooper  found in his  it's kind of like  Opie found in  his little box  and stuff  this guy had  a reel to reel  he had an  Opie act 
[02:23:30]  and we basically  paid him money  to transfer it  into a digital  format for him  and the ones  that we have  right now  on the Dave  Rabbit site  the pod site  which is  DaveRabbit.podomatic.com  has the  remastered version  of the entire  show  and plus  we've got  you know  the Iraq show  which I did  as a 35th  anniversary  with a new  team  but yeah  we've got  there's over  500 bits  of DaveRabbit  stuff on that 
[02:24:00]  site  because I can't  put everything  on above  topsecret.com  because we're  G rated  we're a family  site  I can't put  a lot of  the DaveRabbit  material there  but you know  those guys  that really  like that  kind of  stuff  there's a  ton of  it on  the  DaveRabbit.podomatic.com  what are you  doing now  as far as  your podcast  what kind  of show  you're doing  well  you know  it's about  what we  are  which is our  ecosystem  that was  created by  the genius  Simon Gray  who was  the founder  of above  topsecret.com 
[02:24:30]  we lovingly  call them  the three  amigos  and basically  it's about  alternative  subjects  such as  conspiracy  theories  9-11  conspiracy  theories  UFOs  aliens  I mean  just anything  that you  can imagine  that would  be a topic  of conspiracy  or whatever  would be  what we're  talking about  I mean  they have  weaponry  resources  and uploads  really above  topsecret  secret  societies  it's just  a smorgasbord  if you will  of every 
[02:25:00]  alternative  topic you  can possibly  think of  is it kind  of like  I'm starting  to interrupt  is it kind  of like  a coast  to coast  like Art Bell  type subject  no  and I'll  tell you  why  because  in my  respects  to  George  and Art Bell  and those  guys over  at coast  to coast  but what  we do  is we  take the  same  subjects  but instead  of being  there like  two squirrels  going 69  which is  exciting  for a few  minutes  and then  it kind  of loses  its appeal  we put  levity 
[02:25:30]  and humor  and put  a lot  more  at ease  with our  guests  and we  just have  a good  time  we rock  and roll  when we get  with our  people  we get  a little  taste of  Dave Rabbit  but on  a FCC  compliant  basis  if you know  what I mean  very nice  well Dave  we definitely  have to take  a break  here  this was  a pleasure  though  great talking  to you  yeah  absolutely  I have to  tell you guys  you guys  were an  inspiration  we just  donated  $25,000  to the  Girl Scout  organization  for their  new drive 
[02:26:00]  to sell  garlic  butter  sauce  can you do  a little  Dave Rabbit  as we go  to break  here  or what  oh sure  yeah  you want  to do  a typical  outro  here  yeah  sure  all right  listen  on behalf  of the  Opie and  Anthony  show  here in  New York  City  this is  Dave Rabbit  peace  all right  thank you Dave  thanks Dave  good luck buddy  we'll be in touch  alright  there he goes  Dave Rabbit  because uh  21 day  legend 
[02:26:30]  yes  that's what  I'm saying  lasted that  long  yeah  cool story  absolutely  uh  why don't we  go back in  time  uh  Dave Rabbit  Vietnam  1970  doing the  underground  radio show  that we just  discussed  for the last  few minutes  good evening  this is Air Force  Sergeant Dave  Rabbit  and this is  Nugent  with tonight's  news  in Washington  today  President Nixon  was officially  charged in  connection with  the Miley  Massacre  although the  president was  nowhere near  Vietnam at the  time  higher ranking  officials are 
[02:27:00]  positive that  there is some  connection  what however  they aren't  sure of  no comment  from the  president was  available  Nugent  in Alabama  Governor George  Wallace is  announced as  his running  mate for the  presidential election  as H.  Rapp Brown  Rapp was not  available for  comment but his  associates say  it was the  happiest day of  his life  a blissful  event has  occurred for  Tiny Tim  and his wife  19 year old  Miss Vicki  they have  announced the  coming birth of  their first  child  when asked  about the  nervous tension  and stress  of having a  first child 
[02:27:30]  Tiny Tim  stated that  he's sure  he'll have  no problem  giving birth  the first  time  he also  stated that  the baby  will be  breastfed  Miss Vicki  also said  that Tiny  will have to  have his  chest shaved  so the baby  won't gag  on the hairs  finally  finally in the  news  Lyndon Johnson  was arrested  in his Texas  home for  indecent public  exposure  after he led  a group of  Vietnam protesters  down Main Street  Johnson was also  cited on ten counts  of public  vulgarity  and one count  for shooting the  finger at an  Air Force officer  preliminary hearing  dates have not 
[02:28:00]  been set yet  and that's the news  this is Air Force  Sergeant Dave  Rabbit  and Nugent  wishing you a  very good evening  the voice of news  information and  hard acid rock music  this is Radio  First Termer  at 69 megacycles  on your FM dial  wow  little pieces of  history  it's pretty cool  you know  absolutely  hearing what was  going on back  then  them goofing on  it  Anthony from  Boston  do you think  Good Morning  Vietnam's  Robin Williams  is based on  Dave Rabbit  absolutely not  Adrian Cronauer  I believe  yeah he was  around the same  time obviously 
[02:28:30]  but Dave Rabbit  was doing his  own thing  very different  actually  because Robin  Williams  the character  he played  was high energy  this guy was  all about  just kind  of sounding  or being  stoned  I've had  a few  requests  for some  pictures  of myself  so some  of you people  wanted to hang  some on your  walls or in  the latrines  or something  but to tell you  the honest to  God truth  I have really  no pictures  of myself  that can be 
[02:29:00]  made into  posters  however I do  have one  picture that  some of you  might want  it's a picture  of myself  and my  ex-girlfriend  going  in her  bathtub  now if you'd  like a copy  of this  which is  blown up  by the way  into an  8x10 glossy  colored photograph  just drop  me a card  to  Dave Rabbit  Pornofic  picture  poster  APON  country  96969 
[02:29:30]  and I'll  try to get  one  to you  more music  now  Donovan  hurtie  gertie  man  hurtie  gertie  man  he was  making up  all this  crap  because who  would want  a picture  of him  he only  broadcasts  in three  weeks  although he's  probably getting  a lot of  letters  on me  he had  20 something  million people  that guy  would make  an impact  pretty quickly  with the  soldiers  I think  mouthing off  like that  about stuff  cornball radio  they were used  to  yeah 
[02:30:00]  yeah  and then  him  he's just  dropping  f-bombs  taking a  jump  screwing  his  girl  and the  whores  and  good stuff  and answering  some of your  questions as  what the base  commander  thinks of me  here are his  exact words  if I ever meet  that son of a  bitch  I'm gonna walk  up and I'm  gonna hit that  right square  in a god damn  key  more than once  would you believe  that's what the  base commander  thinks of me  and my  nasty ways  tsk  tsk  tsk  tsk 
[02:30:30]  you  sir  first I emphasize  the word sir  he has an  inferiority complex  I mean after all  anybody that dresses  up in women's  dresses  and carries a  velvet purse  has to be a  little bit weird  what a set man  no kidding  and finally the  last clip  the show ending  this was the  last show right  here  yeah  this is the  ending of that  show  of this particular  show  well unfortunately  it's that time 
[02:31:00]  again for  to go  repeat  myself  we've just about  reached the ending  of another radio  first trailer  for the night  and we'd like to  leave you with a few  closing thoughts  first off  remember  there is no  black power  or white power  in Vietnam  there's only one  power  and that's  rabbit  power 
[02:31:30]  another thought  when you go  downtown  we should have  taken up  rubbers along  in case you want  to go for  two or three  or four  or five  or six or seven  like Pete does  well Pete  I've enjoyed it  it's been another  fantastic night  of cutting the  air force to  pieces  and saying  nasty things  on the air  and hopefully  if we're not  feeling jail  by tomorrow night  we'll be able  to come back  again at 8 o'clock  and blow your  mind with more  hard acid music  so  on behalf of 
[02:32:00]  myself  and for  good old Pete  we'd like to say  goodnight to each  other  Pete let's say  goodnight to each  other  goodnight Pete  goodnight  sounds professional  doesn't it  huh  be tuning in again  tomorrow night  please  don't whack off  listen to all  the old face  camera instead  it's more  filling  okay Pete  we haven't  practiced this  folks  this is our

Alabama man!  you said this needs  a set up right?  yeah a little bit  apparently in Alabama  where's Nick Carter?  yeah  oh 
[02:38:00]  oh  now now  he's a very lovely gentleman  who works for a very lovely station  oh  so  you can trash whoever you want  Danny  so  apparently in Alabama  there were  some  legislation was trying to get passed  on whether or not  they should raise  where was this?  Alabama  Alabama mile  uh huh  and uh  legislation was trying to get passed  to see if they should raise  the legal alcohol limit  of beer past 6%  where?  in uh  I think it was Alabama 
[02:38:30]  Alabama mile  okay  mile  6%  yeah  they wanted to  I guess  there was some  beer that was going to be imported  but it wasn't legal to sell  so they were going to try to bump up  the alcohol percentage  so they could sell it in the state  so what are you and Anthony  are going to protest in New York  to have that sold here?  well  bring it on  and make it legal to drive  while drinking it  uh  you know  all of the representatives  were  you know  deciding whether or not  they should  pass this  legislation  and this was one of the  elected  one of the elected officials 
[02:39:00]  from Alabama  this is what he said  in this meeting  so he's uh  this guy's  like  he's a representative  uh  representative of the public  okay  we just want to make that  perfectly clear  yeah what's wrong  with the beer we got  I mean the beer we got  drank pretty good  don't it  I ain't never heard  nobody complain  about the uh  beer we have  it drank pretty good  no it's not  no it's not  this is not 
[02:39:30]  that is not  an elected official  it sounds like a homeless guy  no it's not  it sounds like a homeless guy  that guy's looking for a leprechaun  in a tree  yeah  I want the beer  I want the beer  I think it's a crackhead  could be a crackhead  might be a 7%  that cannot  possibly be  somebody that ran  for an office  and was elected  uh  voted into that office  no I won't accept that 
[02:40:00]  don't you think it's time  to  to take it  uh  take Alabama away  and make it uh  49 states  can  can  maybe  maybe Mexico take it  just  something  just make Alabama  a part of  I don't know  make it its own  country or something  Sparta  make it a part of Sparta  Sparta  that  makes no  how  I  I'm stunned  yo what's wrong  with the beer we got  yo  yo  what's wrong with the beer we got 
[02:40:30]  yo  what's wrong with the beer we got  who want the beer we got  say yeah  he's a public official  a public official  wait he ran for office  or ran from an officer  yeah  maybe that was it  wordplay  we got the leprechaun story  we'll play that going into break  but let's get uh  through this clip  yeah what's wrong with the beer we got  I mean the beer we got  drank pretty good  drank pretty good  I ain't never heard nobody complain 
[02:41:00]  about the uh  beer we have  it drank pretty good  Budweiser  what's the name of some of them other beers  Budweiser what is  Miller  Miller  Colt  it drank pretty good don't it  I can't even  you hear how he said Miller  Mo  Mo  Mo  I gotta hear  I gotta hear that last  part again  I'm  a stunned  Budweiser 
[02:41:30]  what's the name of some of them other beers  Budweiser what is  Miller  Miller  Mo  Mo  is that a crony of his  it has to be someone else  Mo  Mo  Mo  Mo  they're getting a lot done down there huh  no wonder that place is just a crap hole  and this was a clip from a very lengthy discussion about whether or not they should just have  could you get more of this guy  well I think this is the only part where he interjected 
[02:42:00]  there's more audio of like the other representatives  right  but I'm not sure if there's more of this particular one  but can I ask how bad are his improv skills where you run out of beer after a Budweiser  Budweiser what's the other one  about the beer we have  it drank pretty good  Budweiser  what's the name of some of them other beers  Budweiser what is  Mill  I love that guy 
[02:42:30]  that's gonna make me laugh  I think I bumped into him  in GTA 4 last night  Mo  that's from a band cartoon  I loved him in Silence of the Lambs  how do you spell that out  because I need to say that all day  but I can't  Mo  but how is it  wait  about the beer we have  it drank pretty good  Budweiser  what's the name of some of them other beers  Budweiser what is 
[02:43:00]  Mill  it drank pretty good  M-I-L-L-U-H  yeah  is that it  Mool  Mool  oh wow  that  that  I  keep this clip close  oh yeah  we will be playing this  ad nauseum  that's a fave  oh yeah  that kick is close  when I was pulling that  that wasn't  I mean I heard  I heard him say it  but that was nowhere even close  to being my favorite part of the clip 
[02:43:30]  but now it is  Mo  what was your favorite part  well  it drinks pretty good  it drinks pretty good  it drinks pretty good  do you have video of this guy  no it's just like  in the video it was pulled from  it was just like  a graphic of him  oh  and then the audio underneath it  Iraq  Steven S. from Bayshore  is in a panic  he wants this for the O&A rundown  oh who wouldn't  that he writes  and that will be up on  onaradio.com  a little later today  now the questions come in  Jared listening on BCN  Jared what's up  hey not much 
[02:44:00]  Anthony you make a great point  about this guy  actually got elected  I want to know  who he ran against  yeah really  he ran against  one of those  leprechaun spotters  the only person  he could have ran against  is somebody that just  clicks when they talk  punch it out  alright very nice  he defeated  some guy who started  Apocalypto  guy ran through  guy ran through  his constituency  with a hatchet  like alright  we'll take  the guy with  the miller friend  let's go to 
[02:44:30]  Tony in White Plains  Tony  yeah I thought  the Alabama primaries  were over  what's Barack  still campaigning for  oh no  Barack  what  Barack doesn't  sound like that  at all  what  uh  Mongo the trucker  Mongo what are you  hauling today  um  I have a  payloader on  yeah  yeah  alright  what's that  that's not good  cargo  yeah that's  boring cargo  boring cargo  apparently in Alabama 
[02:45:00]  they use public  service as  community service  yeah that's good  that's very nice  okay  I love how he can  only name one beer  like Jesus dude  are you  do you want to  hear that again  oh they got  Bud Watson  what's another  one  I'm out  what's another  one  Budweiser  he says it  twice  I'm spent  with this  improv  thing  after Budweiser  it's all  downhill  the whole clip  again  yeah what's wrong  with the beer  we got  I mean the beer 
[02:45:30]  we got  drank pretty good  don't it  I ain't never  heard nobody  complain  about the  beer we have  it drank pretty  good  Budweiser  I was named  some of them  other beer  Budweiser  what is it  Miller  Miller  I love Miller  guys  it's great to do  it don't it  Miller  Miller  we laugh every time  I think there's  another little  funny thing in there  right after  right after he says  Miller 
[02:46:00]  I was named  some of them  other beer  Budweiser  what is it  Miller  Miller  Miller  Coons  Coons  Coons  he says  Coons  he goes  Miller  Coons  yeah listen  to the same  Coons  it's Blair's  cousin Jerry  what's the name  some of them  other beer  Budweiser  what is it  Miller  Miller  Coons  Coons  I love to see 
[02:46:30]  that guy  get more audio  Coons  Coons  we got the  Coons  Miller  Miller  well it  reminds us of  one of our  favorite stories  ever  the leprechaun  story  the local  saw a leprechaun  in a tree  here  here it is  as we take a break  Opie and Anthony  curiosity leads  to large crowds  in Mobile's  Crichton community  many of you 
[02:47:00]  bringing binoculars  cancorders  even camera phones  to take pictures  to me  it look like a leprechaun  to me  I gotta do a look  up in the tree  who else  in the leprechaun  say yeah  yeah  eyewitnesses say  the leprechaun  only comes out  at night  if you shine a light  in its direction  it suddenly disappears  this amateur sketch  resembles what many of you  say the leprechaun  looks like  others find it hard  to believe  and have come up  with their own theories  and explanations  for the image  my theory is 
[02:47:30]  it's casting a shadow  from the other limb  could be a crackhead  that got home  to the wrong stuff  and it told him  to get up in the tree  and play a leprechaun  we're gonna get down  to the bottom of this  you're still on there  guy  don't be afraid  don't be afraid  man  this guy  helping to direct traffic  says he's prepared  for his encounter  with the leprechaun  he's suited up  from head to toe  this was all spells  right here  this is a special 
[02:48:00]  leprechaun flute  which has been passed down  from thousands of years ago  from my great great  grandfather  who was Irish  and I just came to help out  others just came  to get lucky  in hopes a pot of gold  may be buried  under this tree  I'm gonna run a backhoe  and uproot that tree  I wanna know  where to go  I want the gold  give me the gold  I want the gold  oh you got Alvin Holmes  the beer bill guy  right  from earlier  I'm a 
[02:48:30]  member of the  Alabama House of Representatives  here in Alabama  we haven't even said  hardy  how are you sir  hi Alvin  yes  now we were  listening to some audio  of you  talking about  this beer ruling  absolutely  on the house floor  yeah  can you explain  for people that might be  tuning in for the first time  this morning  this is a big thing  going on in Alabama  well it has passed  the Alabama legislature  and raised the content 
[02:49:00]  in certain beer  alcohol content  in certain beer  and of course  I was in opposition  to the beer  you were  yes I was in opposition  to it  my statement  on the floor  of the House  of Representatives  is that  what we have  at the present time  is fine  and we do not  need to increase  the alcohol content  in beer  or any other  alcoholic beverages  here in Alabama  well Mr. Holmes  I think you raised  a good point  because I mean  like what's 
[02:49:30]  what are they trying  to say  like what's wrong  with like the other  the beers we have  what are  we have  yeah how many beers  we got  what's a beer  we have  oh my god  I don't know  you have plenty of them  like what  can you name a few  Budweiser  that's fine  yeah  yeah they have  Budweiser  and other traditional  beers here  in Alabama  I think  we have  I was in opposition  to it  because we have  here in the state  of Alabama  numbers 
[02:50:00]  I can't  call all  all of them  the beers  we have  and wines  and other  well what beers  are we talking  about  you got the Budweiser  it's a German beer  the one that  they're trying  to get it now  well no  they wanted to  legalize  raising the content  of alcohol  in German beer  in Alabama  and they did  oh they did  is it from  is it a German beer 
[02:50:30]  for export only  is it Pisswasser  I heard of a beer  that they're doing  for export  yeah yeah  it is  okay  it is  for export only  Pisswasser  yeah  yes  and I was  in opposition  to it  I thought  many of our  young people  have access  to beer  and I thought  it would be  a bad thing  for the young people  oh really  so you know  like people  that are older  can make up  their own minds  but the younger  people might 
[02:51:00]  just want  more alcohol  absolutely  and at colleges  and universities  across the country  you know  fraternities  and sororities  gathering  you know  they have a lot  of beer  and I thought  that it would  be a bad thing  for the young people  but it did pass  unfortunately  what is this  going to mean  for the great  state of Alabama  just means  that the people  in Alabama  will be able  to drink a beer  with more  alcohol content 
[02:51:30]  in it  do you think  that's good  though in a way  like for financial  reasons  because like  instead of  people  it would help  the state  financially  some  but I think  the problems  that it will  create among  the young people  will be  greater than  the benefits  that the state  of Alabama  will receive  well sir  would they consider  raising the legal  limit for drinking  and driving  because a lot  of people say  it's way too low  what is it  in Alabama  is it a 1.0  is the legal 
[02:52:00]  limit for driving  because I mean  you have to be  a certain age  in the state  of Alabama  you have to be  21 years old  to buy  alcoholic beverage  right  oh no sir  I mean  when you're drinking  they do a breathalyzer test  there's a legal  limit you're allowed  to have  .1  or is it .08  yes  I think  that is the correct  one  maybe .08  so maybe  maybe they could  raise it  like because  the alcohol 
[02:52:30]  is going to be  stronger  so maybe  they should  allow people  to drink  a little bit  more  while they're  driving  well  perhaps  they should  but they  did not  do that  they just  passed  this particular  bill  where's your  stance  on the  Lopweiser  on  Buckweiser  the Lopweiser  it's a  it's another  German import  that the kids  today seem  to be fancy  very big in  Florida  yeah  well I don't  have any  objection  to  you know  I'm not  an isolationist  I don't have  any objection  to foreign  trade 
[02:53:00]  or anything  of that sort  but whether  it's beer  or any  other item  it's just  my position  I don't think  in the state  of Alabama  or any  other state  that we  should be  raising the  content of  alcohol  beverage  I mean  what we  have today  is fine  and people  enjoy that  hey Alvin  we got a lot  of youngsters  that listen  to the  Opie and  Anthony show  want to have  just a little  bit of fun  here  can you  name as  many beers  as possible 
[02:53:30]  in 15  seconds  we kind of  do it like  a morning zoo  type of program  here we try  to get the  info out there  and the facts  and we deal  with serious  issues but we  also like to  have a little  fun  I don't  drink beer  when I was  in the military  I had a  cup of  beers  that made  me real  sick  and I  messed with  it since  I mean  you know  you got  Budweiser  and Slits  beer  are real  popular  here in  Alabama  and then 
[02:54:00]  you have  Coors  those are  the only  ones  that I  see  what about  the  Miller  what else  we're almost  done with  the bit  we got  they probably  have some  others  I don't  pay any  attention  to it  Schlitz  wow I  haven't  heard that  name in  a long  time  no kidding  that's  that's  where we  shipped  all that  beer  off  to  how 
[02:54:30]  yeah  can't  they  just  get  whiskey  then  pardon  me  can't  young  people  just  get  like  whiskey  anyway  which  has  more  alcohol  yeah  in the  state  of  Alabama  you  can  buy  any  form  of  alcohol  if  you're  21  or  older  yeah  so it  doesn't  matter  if it's  in the  beer 
[02:55:00]  or if  it's  in the  whiskey  or  tequila  beer  whiskey  wine  you are  prohibited  unless you're  21 or  older  buying that  or buying  any  tobacco  product  Mr. Alvin  Holmes  are you  suggesting  with this  phone call  that we  raise a  generation  of  super kids  well  the only  thing  I'm  saying  that  one of  the biggest  problems  we have  in America  today  among  young  people  drugs 
[02:55:30]  and  alcohol  and I  don't  I think  we need  to control  it as  best  as we  can  should  they  lower  the  drinking  age  sir  is that  part  of  the  problem  is  that  people  have  to  wait  too  long  to  start  drinking  that  when  Alabama  legislature  passed  the  law  I  was  forlorn  it  to  19  because  I  took  the  position  that  at  that  time  that  people  if  they  eligible  to be  drafted  into  the  military  service  and by 
[02:56:00]  the  way  they  had  the  draft  law  at  the  time  this  was  passed  by the  legislature  if  they  can  go  and  fight  for  the  country  I  think  if  they  are  19  but  they  decided  on  21  I  think  you're  right  I  think  if you  lower it  down  to  even  16  I  think  by the  time  they reach  18  or  19  years  old  they're  more  used  to  drinking  and much  better  at  drinking  and driving  much better  tolerance  absolutely  yeah  and the  age  of  consent  thing  too  I  mean  that  should  all  be  dropped  a little  bit  they're  far 
[02:56:30]  too  high  up  on  the  ladder  I  was  19  but  they  decided  on  21  yeah  that's  too  bad  sir  okay  well  thank  you  Alvin  Holmes  from  the  Alabama  legislature  legislature  Alabama  House of  Representatives  all  right  thank you  sir  thank you  bye  bye  for some  reason  or another  you sound  a little  taller  on radio  for the 
[02:57:00]  people just  tuning in  we got to  play our  favorite clip  in a long  time  Danny  came up  with this  today  the guy  we just  had on  the phone  we have  audio of  this guy  his name  is  Alvin  Holmes  of  Alabama  and he  discusses  whether  to  raise  legal  alcohol  limit  of  beer  and this  audio  has been  making us  laugh  all morning  long  as they  continue  to laugh  in the  background  here it is  one more  time  that led 
[02:57:30]  to our  exclusive  interview  with  Mr.  Holmes  yeah  what's wrong  with the  beer we  got  I mean  the beer  we got  drank pretty  good  don't it  I ain't  never heard  nobody  complain  about  the  beer  we have  it drank  pretty  good  Budweiser  what's  name  some  of  them  other  beers  Budweiser  and what  is  Miller  Miller  it drank  pretty  good  don't  it  it 
[02:58:00]  drank  pretty  good  don't  it  you sound  a little  more subdued  on our  phone  than  that  he was  all excited  about  for some  reason  or another  you sound  a little  taller  on radio  I just  caught the  way he  looked  for some  reason  or another  look at him  like  yeah  Denny just  ran in  more Alvin  Holmes  audio  let's see 
[02:58:30]  if there's  something  here  when Alabama  lawmakers  met in  February  to approve  a bill  to free  up more  bond  money  state  representative  Alvin  Holmes  expressed  his  concerns  I'm not  going to  be for it  unless  all the  attorneys  is  competitively  bidded  all the  underwriters  are competitively  bidded  because when  you start  dealing  with  bond  issues  you're  talking  about  a lot  of  money  and he  looks  like  like  Clay  from  the  wire  but with  a little  bit of  a mustache

[03:28:30]  that Steve  possibly got  pwned  well we all  got pwned  but Steve  thinks everything  is what  real on the  internet  so  unless it's  fake  then it's  fake  but I think  it's real  so it's  real  we ask  we ask  Steve  all the  time  when we  see  something  on the  internet  we go  Steve  is that  real  or fake  and if  he says  fake  we absolutely  know it's  real  and vicey  versa  Steve is a  very easy  Steve is a  dope  scroll

[03:30:30]  because of  the  then  pointed out  because of  the porn  charges  child porn  charges  you can't  name names  when they're  underage  now they're  not referring  to him  as Corey  anymore  in the news  stories  a youth  they're calling  them  but you know  who it is  from yesterday  you do  today  they're just  calling them  a youth  hello  can I speak  to a youth  oh wait  but maybe it  wasn't Corey  though  maybe it was  someone from  his body  it's another  youth  a youth  faces  child porn  and other  charges  attending  a wild 
[03:31:00]  party  that left  a trail  of damage  a wild  party  that left  a trail  of damages  terrorized  neighbors  and caused  an international  storm  storm  two 16 year  olds face  court over  the infamous  party  one male  has been  charged with  producing  child pornography  and creating  a public  nuisance  he has been  bailed to  appear at a  children's court  next month  the other  is expected  to be charged  on summons  to also appear  dozens of  police  the dog  squad  and a  helicopter  were forced  to control  a mob  of 500 
[03:31:30]  youths  at the  unsupervised  party  over the  weekend  booze  fueled  party  goers  allegedly  damaged  cars  destroyed  gardens  and littered  streets  with empty  alcohol  containers  the party  which was  advertised  on myspace  has hit  world  headlines  the fallout  has reverberated  across news  bulletins  websites  and internet  internet  forms across  the globe  people act  like this is  the LA riots  who gives a  fuck  a bunch of  white kids  running around  a shitty  fucking  flat country  fucking  tumble  who gives a  fuck 
[03:32:00]  so this  is where  we get  dragged  into the  story  we got  the kid  on the  phone  yesterday  that threw  the party  we just  played his  audio  obviously  and now  it looks  like it  wasn't the  kid  right  according to  or at least  according to  everybody  yeah  oh it's  everybody  now  well no  this does  seem like  it was a  scam  definitely  yeah it  seems like  here's  exactly  what happened  the website  that you guys  plugged yesterday  like within  24 hours  of the kid  being on the  show is now  is now redirecting 
[03:32:30]  to some other  website that says  haha gotcha  oh shit  yeah basically  it was  can we get the  guy on and give  him his props  sure  I'll call him  uh oh  I inadvertently  got the real  guy  yeah  Travis had the  guys correct  myspace  what's that  about  oh shit  oh no  what's up  Travis  what do you  got on this  good evening  when Steve  asks me to do  something I 
[03:33:00]  usually try and  do it  and then  Steve will try  and do it  at the same  time  and  okay  and he won't  you know he  won't match  notes with me  before he  bursts into  my booth  with a phone  number  I found  I found the  guy's fake  myspace  and Sam and  I immediately  knew that it  was fake  because you've  made so many  fake myspaces  for people  that's not true  because he had 
[03:33:30]  all his pictures  were just you  know screen  caps of this  kid that was  on the news  oh okay  yeah any idiot  would know that  yeah and then  and then I find  his real myspace  two seconds  later with you  know personal  pictures of him  and his email  address so I  sent the guy  an email  and uh  ten minutes  later Steve  bursts into  my booth  saying I  found his  myspace and  I've got his  phone number  and that's  uh  and you were a  wealth of  information when  there were six  people trying to  dial this guy  on the phone  yesterday 
[03:34:00]  Steve it doesn't  matter I found  the guy's real  myspace  well no the  point I  understand  I look I'm  not saying I  didn't get  I didn't get  duped  I did a little  research before  I  I did the same  thing you did  I did the same  thing you did  which is go  online you check  google you google  google the kid's  name unfortunately  the one I the one  I I wound up  contacting was  ranked higher than  the one you  wound up contacting  and that's why  and and that was  the first kid I  got a response  from anyway  well I look for  point is listen  wait did you get  the guy's email  you back  no he never 
[03:34:30]  emailed I think  that's because he's  in police custody  okay yeah he was  uh actually in  custody when we  were talking I  think to the  well people  yesterday it's  all 30 in the  in the a.m.  no he was  arrested after that  I think we got  duped so um  the world gets  uh brainwaved  is that a new  term or just  for the stupid  website yeah  uh it's safe to  say john's  surname and  myself are  probably the  greatest humans  alive that's a  little pompous  yeah a little  arrogant so this 
[03:35:00]  is the guy that  duped us yeah  well that guy  really uh thinks  he's the greatest  person alive not a  lot of humility  there he said it's  safe to say john's  surname and myself  are probably the  greatest humans  alive humans are  you crazy about  jonas salk  you pulled a  good prank  something out  there sorry no  one gets the  polio reference  i got it thank  you they uh they  had a good day  congratulations for  that that doesn't 
[03:35:30]  make you the  greatest humans  alive we are not  even for that day  you had a good  day uh it  started innocent  innocently enough  john created a post  on cory delaney  saying what a  twat he was and i  searched for his  myspace to gather  some more info to  no prevail it  suddenly clicked  if no one can  find his myspace  why not just  create one for  him we set to  work creating a  cheesy looking  background that  travis noticed  with uh with  classic party boy  music as well as  a fake pricing  list for his so  called parties  and an edited 
[03:36:00]  video describing  virtually the same  thing here it is  in the flesh  and that's where  it would be on  this paper but  no i think it's  on the next page  uh we even  registered the  domain name uh  corydelaney.org  just that's the  one that was given  out to us uh to  keep the hits  up then we  just sat back  and waited to  have a good laugh  before people would  pick up that it's a  complete thud and  that it would surely  fade out after a few  hours i mean no one  would believe that  this is the actual  cory delaney delaney  right why wouldn't  they like why are they  making it seem like you  have to be a complete 
[03:36:30]  idiot to think a guy  with an australian  accent that isn't even  saying ridiculous things  wouldn't be this guy  right  douchebag  wow great observation  from joe in valley  stream travis has legs  like matt roloff  oh god  i think they're a  little longer  they're they look  about the same though  they're pretty  i like matt roloff  this season on  little people big  world he's in a  swimsuit and you get  to see his legs that  are barely there  yikes  it's not bad enough  that he's a dwarf  he's got legs that  are just horrific 
[03:37:00]  uh the guy ends up  uh saying wrong  within two hours we  had around 1,000  page views with a  good 100 friends  another two hours  later we had close  to 5,000 hits with  four times as many  friends emails with  job offers marriage  proposals people asking  for radio interviews  as well as numerous  requests for parties  run by the man  himself stuff like  this was regular i am  the director of blank  website i will pay  you twenty thousand  dollars uh to fly  you to new york if  you shout out my  company i also have a 
[03:37:30]  website uh another  poster i also have a  website i want you to  promote my next party  i will fly you out to  new york you can stay  at my penthouse in  midtown or i will get  you a room at the  four seasons these are  creeps that want to  have sex with the kid  of course they are  uh we were shell  shocked surely the  globe can't be this  stupid the myspace is  obviously a fake  judging by the  following facts phony  price lists that are  obviously a gag  paragraphs that pay  him out to no extent  and you can check this  out for yourself is that  still up there uh no 
[03:38:00]  because that's what's  up there right now that  what that is looking  at is what's up there  right now uh so you  can see uh all right  corydelaney.org just  says uh you all got  brainwave uh the fact  that it says this is  the who i'd like to  meet section uh  whatever oh and the  small issue of cory  being held in a police  station for questioning  while we did majority  while we did the  majority of this stuff  on myspace the who  i'd like to meet thing  is uh they say i'd like  to meet the real cory  what's his face delaney  oh okay that was hard  to read that who the  fuck knows what time 
[03:38:30]  it is in that shit  country right anyone  that has an iphone yeah  yeah you just pop it  right in there boom  tells you what time it  is the whole world  cares a big party with  a bunch of fucking  white kids running  probably through a dirt  street no one cares  berries in it and  then berries and then  and then a dead dingo  on the side of the road  a wallaby a fucking elk  taking shits in the  driveway and then uh

[04:07:30]  we gave it away with the grape soda  oh jesus  oh no we did  but that is i will say  that is that is our our the the dismissive paranoia  that you people do to us  which is we we know that you put sterilizations  sterilizing agents  in the great fruit punch  in the great punch  think of what would happen if we didn't  mr billy thank you for being honest  you put sterilizing 
[04:08:00]  you put that  you  we all know you invented aids  yeah  sure  i'll fess up to that  thank you very much  i know that the illuminati  the illuminati  and you said looks  the head of the illuminati  patrice said he looks like the quaker oats guy  it's just this vast white conspiracy  that's based on symbols and stuff  you know like the masons  and uh  the pyramid and the eyeball on the back of the dollars  and the pentagram and pentagon  i don't want to believe it 
[04:08:30]  i don't want to believe it  but you  look there's a youtube thing called  just look at the  the symbols  you look at the dollar  let's let's take the fucking dollar  and the fact that after 9-11  you can fold it up  and you can see the twin towers burning  now  right  why  i could also fold up  uh washington's head  and make it look like a mushroom  but wait a minute  why  the fuck  mushroom's good  when you fold up a dollar  does it look like  the world tracing a burning  and then  because you're crazy  and you have problems  in your brain  because your brain doesn't work properly 
[04:09:00]  and then who the fuck do things  because you're putting all your energy  in the wrong places  it's not right  which is what black people do  this is  this is what  this is what bothers me  yeah  about some  about some of you  the illuminati  come on man  the illuminati  that takes too much work  to get the dollar bill just right  to make it look like  if we're gonna rig 9-11  why would  you have to use that language  a rig  why would we go all the way back  to the dollar design  and go  that's a lot  we gotta get this dollar  organization 
[04:09:30]  that's a lot of patience  why the fuck  and why wouldn't they have done it  a lot earlier  because it's like  look we got the dollar bill set  let's do this immediately  why is  i knew it  copious  on the fucking dollar bill  wow now i gotta pull out a buck  a black guy trying to read latin  is about as sad as  get your dollar bill out  you fucking fix  shit i only got hundreds  damn  and no surprise  i have no money  so i'm kidding  alright let me see  oh here's a dollar 
[04:10:00]  what the fuck is this shit  on the fire thing  how do you do the towers  on fire thing  i don't know how to do it  it's like origami  you gotta do  what the mushroom  it's a mad fold in  it's the front  it's a mad fold in  oh yeah you do this  is it the front  you gotta front  oh right because his hair  is smoke  and then the  no no no  the frame around it  it's trees  trees  the frame around his head  is uh  looks like a tower  if you fold it right  no it's not  i think his head  is the smoke  oh fuck man  you forgot how to do it 
[04:10:30]  you don't know how to do it  google  shit  oh there it is  look look look  right there  oh yeah you gotta fold it  in a triangle  fuck on man  wow look at that  it's a 20  first of all it's a 20  oh it's a 20  yeah you idiot  shit patrice  go knock one of them  over the head  and grab one  oh it's a 20  dude look at that  shit  that's nothing  that's nothing  to you  that's somebody  figured out  why would we do that  because would we do that  what's to be gained  because like the 
[04:11:00]  honorable  the fucking back of a 20  was designed  like a million years ago  exactly  why do that  patrice  just to go  na na na na na  like the honorable  reverend right  so you think  we designed the 20  and then we  to make that picture  and then like  a hundred years later  somebody designed  the twin towers  match it  there it is  it's burning  look at that  there it is  you just fucking  take a look at that  two towers  one's taller than the other  and it's on fire  that is fucking  what kind of coincidence  is that

[04:12:00]  now that would be  fucked up  if somebody did it  before  then that would be  better  at least you go  oh  better  look at the towers  burning  and then it happens  and then you'd be like  who was that  fucking guy  they did this  years before 9-11  and people went  ah it looks like  nothing  oh well  and then one day  people were like  holy shit  it looks like  the towers  burning  listen man  I'm gonna try  to invent something  I'm just gonna  take a 10  I'm gonna try  to fold it up  and show black people  rioting  Louie  Louie  Louie  I am begging  to the  to half of you  please 
[04:12:30]  I'm gonna  I'm begging  to you  all right  see you gotta  give white people  more credit than that  okay look  I wanna show you  the back of a 10  folded the same way  it's the towers again  if you fold any  fucking bill like this  the towers are gonna  be burning  okay  then that even  makes it more scary  I'm making a hairy  pussy out of my dollar  just give me a few  minutes here  I'm going with  70's earth mama  muff  if you look at a 20  just look at a 20  for a second  the front of it 
[04:13:00]  just unfolded  and look at  Andrew Jackson  and the collar  of his jacket  looks like  two  women's black  legs  and he's like  diving into  and she's got  little white  panties  look at it  do you see it  oh yeah I see it  like two  like knees  up in the air  and he's about to  dip down  and see the little  white panties  right above the  word jackson  you ever do the  thing with the  butter  the girl with  the black  woman's pussy  the little  Indian girl  that's on her  knees  with the butter  no you make  tits  like she's  holding the butter  like this  but her kneecaps  because she's kneeling  you could fold 
[04:13:30]  her kneecaps  up to her chest  and as a kid  that was almost  jerk off material  this is dismissive  I can't allow this  you can't marginalize  the Illuminati  it's there  there's no reason  where's the owl  hold on  where's the owl  Patrice  where's the owl  and what does that mean  where's the owl  on what dollar bill  what dollar bill  is the owl on  on the one  I gotta find out  if I'm looking at this  there's supposedly  something with the Illuminati  about the owl  a small owl  somewhere  where  I see the eye 
[04:14:00]  above the pyramid  alright you fold 100  you get nothing  you get like a fucking  bad shave job  on a pussy  where's the owl  come on  come on  where is the owl  what's this with the owl  why does the owl  mean so much  to the Illuminati  it's all evil shit  man  where's the owl  since where's the owl  the evil  that little blob  is an owl  oh shit  thank you  thank you Mars  of course Mars  we know  what's the matter  because he's down  but he wants to  keep his job  it's a minor  come on Mars  you know about the Illuminati 
[04:14:30]  don't you  sit down  fuck that shit  alright what's the Illuminati  Mars  help us out  don't get nervous man  fuck that  I'll give you a job  fixing my computer  no actually  I wanna see  I wanna see  a little crack  happen in this window  and Mars  just collapse in his seat  as blood comes from his head  why is that  why  that's the devil pentagram  man  so what does that mean  that's fucking devil worship  and fucking pagan shit  the star has been  part of this country  for many years  part of the flag obviously 
[04:15:00]  part of a lot of symbols  part of devil worship  more devil worship  he's saying  the pentagram  is just huge  pentagram  but  pentagram  pentagon  motherfuckers  yeah the number five  is a little hard to avoid  it's right between  four and six  it's a fucking  pyramid  look at this shit  is all symbols  Illuminati  eyeball  on our fucking dollar bill  why  because these are all shapes  that are very useful  in architecture  you believe it right  these are all  there's a reason why  we keep people 
[04:15:30]  using permits  Mars believes it  Mars believes it too  what is the Illuminati  what are they  it's the silent  bunch of white guys  like masons and shit  like that  they're not silent  they're ruling everything  openly  and are hurting black people  for profit  every day  why are you looking  for secrets  there's no secret  it's just like  people are kicking  your ass with notes  Nicolas Cage's movie  they made it  to make fun of it  Disney fun out of it  but it's real shit  it's evil shit  it's black people  putting effort  in the wrong area 
[04:16:00]  Lucas is one  you think  that the founding fathers  set something up  that has continued  all throughout these years  and gotten stronger  it's not fucking  torches  they go  and it's based on  white people  staying in power  absolutely  and they fucking  they have  you know  can I ask you  something though here  what do they say  when they kill  when they kill  white girls  virgin white girls  that is just fun  fun  I'll wait for somebody 
[04:16:30]  I hope nobody  catches me  how come the founding fathers  this was before the civil war  and the emancipation proclamation  so there was still slavery  black people weren't even  it didn't even look like  they were going to be  in charge of anything  or even come  come close to  being in charge  so why would the founding fathers  put in place something  to keep the black man down  when they were already  what do you think is made  to keep the black man down  because it makes everyone suffer  it's not just a black thing  it's the  it's the master plan  to make white people  think certain things  it's the quiet war  that's what the pyramids are 
[04:17:00]  it's the masses  it's the  it's the eyeball  is over the masses  the high  the pinnacle  why are you  high from everything  why are you  folding $20 bills  when  I didn't  fold $20 bills  the Bush  and the Bin Laden family  are business partners  and they fucking  brought down the towers  like right in front of everybody  and then  I mean there's no secret  are you  it's so silly  is this some kind of magic sarcasm  I believe it  motherfucker  you don't even need sarcasm 
[04:17:30]  I believe it  it's like somebody walks up  and punches you in the face  and then you go  fold the dollar  and go  I think this guy's  trying to get me  with this dollar  there's no white people here  not one motherfucker  that believes  that the towers  might have been brought down  on some old creepy shit  not just Arabs  not one  not a one  not one  look at that  that's how you know  it's the Illuminati  I believe it  I believe it  but it's got nothing to do  with the Illuminati  look at this shit here  look at this one  the devil sign  look at the devil sign

[04:22:00]  I mean I can say right now  there's nothing secret  about our  about the Masons  it's the trick  maybe in the past  like during  the colonial times  and  in England  and all that kind of stuff  maybe at that point  but now  it's more of a social  yeah but you're a guy  now  who got in  in the last 10 years  they don't tell you everything  it's not like they tell  all their members  it's not like they go  yeah you're not the top  you guys just joined  let's tell him about  you're just a dude  in Pennsylvania  so tell us a little bit  about what the Masons  are about 
[04:22:30]  well  oh shit  wow  oh shit  oh shit  oh Patrice  oh Patrice is right  wow  I told you  I fucking told you  oh damn  you ain't gonna see him  no more  that motherfucker  is dead  did you see when I asked  these assholes  outside that shit  and did you hear  the humming star  they all went  it's the wicker man  up in this motherfucker  damn  that movie was fucked up 
[04:23:00]  no you guys were talking  about the one man show  oh god damn  that was pretty fun  I was in Montreal  and they  my one man show  and I was just like  who was asking me  Roland was like  you know  what the hell  is your one man show  I'm like  the show's  my one man show  called  My Joke for an Hour  but I don't do them funny  I hate one man shows  they make me  physically ill  the most boring  pompous  it's a pompous thing  for a comic 
[04:23:30]  I'm doing a one man show  every night  when I'm off  for an hour  that's a one man show  it's you  you're talking  why does it have to be  this overly dramatic  thing  hey man  you know  I had a teacher  Miss Inez  she was one of  great math teachers  hold on  let me go get my  Inez wig  good morning kids  oh wow  and the audience  has to like clap  and then I gotta find  some ditty  that she gave me  during my life  you know Inez 
[04:24:00]  and I wanna say  to you children  that 9 out of 10  of you are gonna  be homosexual  it's like  I'm like  why isn't my jokes  enough  to be considered  a one man show  as opposed to  turning into  the guy at the car wash  that tried to rub  my leg  like  for what  one man shows  it's a selfish thing  it totally is  you don't wanna pay  any other actors  or actresses  I'll do all the parts 
[04:24:30]  Billy Crystal  is the king  of the  overblown  pompous  one man show  that he thinks  he's being so profound  and really opening  people's eyes  and minds  to things  when he sits there  and imitates  like the black guy  from New Orleans  yeah  I had my horn  and I played it  and then Katrina  came and took  so many things away  but couldn't take 
[04:25:00]  the spirit  of my music  yeah  the fourth wall  baby  shut up  I don't want  the fourth wall  I don't want people  staring at me  for an hour  with no reaction  yeah  the audience  is just in shock  just sitting there  going  what is this  well one man show  it means  lower your expectations  before you come  into the theater  no set  no other actors  or actresses  when I was  just some  different lighting  20  I worked for a man  that I thought  was really 
[04:25:30]  obnoxious  and stupid  but I later learned  that this man  was very knowledgeable  and  well let me  let me show you  a little bit  about  how he was  but you gotta  turn around  you gotta turn around  and then the lights  change  the lights change  and then you turn around  alright  get back to work  people  here it is  here's his boss  man  guy  and it's just a lamp  and something else  at the desk  but you're such a great actor  that you turn  you turn everything 
[04:26:00]  you can see it  by my reaction  my reaction  to a desk  that's not there  I actually  bumped my knee  into the magical  air desk  it's  magical air desk  you could lean on it  with two hands  I'll never be a great actor  because you didn't want to pay  you didn't want to pay  the stage union  so now there's an imaginary  no set  no cast  I would never in my life  be a great actor  I just watch actors  and it's like  crying scenes  again  it's I Am Legend week  yeah yeah  Will Smith cries  you know like  Dick Vermeule  like he just can cry 
[04:26:30]  anybody who can cry  is amazing  but I go like this  I go after I cry  like after I do  I choke my dog  and I'm just like  please say hello  if I can pull that out  and cry  and then the guy goes  cut  alright  listen Patrice  we're gonna do it again  what  I just cried  did you just see me cry  do you think I can take  a take two  cry  I just attached myself  mentally  to that dead dog  and now I'm gonna cry again 
[04:27:00]  how do they do like  ten takes of  go ahead  cry again  will you stop it  do it again  full disclosure  because it's coming in  on instant feedback  and on the phones now  A Bronx Tale  which was  Chaz's one man show  was amazing  it really was  but I've seen a lot  of one man shows  over the years  and Whoopi's was great  though  Whoopi's original  but that's the typical  Whoopi's original  was great though  but that is a  Whoopi's is a prime  example of  but hers was  oh my god  oh look she's playing 
[04:27:30]  a white little valley girl  I was out before  Elizabeth  when she comes out  around the world  in a day  in my F&D  but that's before  everybody got a hold  of one man shows  and turned them into that  Whoopi's was great  I think it takes  a special talent  and just about  everyone out there  trying to do it  fails miserably  is I guess  what we're trying to say  because Chaz's  was really amazing  I heard y'all talking about 
[04:28:00]  John Luiz  Leguizamo  I was dragged  over one of those  Yeah I can't stand him  One of those things  Anything he's in  Stinks  Has he ever been  a guest on the show?  Who?  No  John Leguizamo  We've said no to him  every single time  Yuck  Oh my god  You didn't like freak?  I was dragged  to that garbage 
[04:28:30]  What was garbage  about it?  I don't like  anything he's in  It's everything  you're saying  He was playing  his aunt  his hoochie mama  and his old grandfather  and his mama  and him as a boy  and him now older  because now he's  looking into the future  You know what the difference  between Chaz Palminteri's  One Man Show is  It's a whole story  a continuing storyline 
[04:29:00]  like it's not really  him just going off  on these stupid  unbelievable characters  that someone's doing  I generally don't support  live performances  He's just that damn good  as an actor  Yeah  This is what it comes down to  Live performance  just makes me sick  Don't go to Broadway  I've tried it  It just sickens me  Any live anything  makes me cringe  Go see Young Frankenstein  You ever seen a  I enjoyed that one  You ever seen a musical?  I went to see  Avenue D 
[04:29:30]  Phooey  The hell is that?  Avenue Q  Avenue Q  Avenue Q  Exactly  Wrong letter  Musicals  like  the opening number  you're like  alright  20 songs later  you're like  holy father of God  alright  everyone has AIDS  I love that one  AIDS  Who cares?  And then  you pray for them  to start talking  in musicals  and they're like  okay they're talking  alright good  and there you only  talk for 15 seconds  to set up the next song  There's the big ensemble 
[04:30:00]  singing  and then there's  the solo  the guy sings  and then the girl sings  and then the cast  sings a big song  and then there's  the big closing number  your curtain goes down  you look at the playbill  and you do the quick math  and you're like  okay they're doing  the candle song  the candle song  there's 15 more songs  to go  15 songs  you just start  counting them down  in your head  alright we knocked off  another song  oh god 
[04:30:30]  enough  live music  if it's somebody  that has an album  I won't go see them live  I don't want to hear  the ooh  I don't want to hear  any extra diddly  the crap version  of the song  you like  I don't want to hear  diddly doo  in my song  that I'm singing  in my head  I don't want to hear  exactly  your artistic  rendition  of your own song  I say that all the time  I don't want to hear  somebody do their song  unless it sounds  exactly like 
[04:31:00]  the recorded version  live rap is unacceptable  oh live rap sucks  live rap  except for  two people  Run DMC  three  sorry  Run DMC  LL Cool J  and Public Enemy  what about Jay Z  you ever see Jay Z  I can't  he's very close  to his album  so I've seen him  on TV  and his live performance  was very close  so I can  I can throw Jay Z  in there  but other than that  I just don't  live performances  I went to  what did I go to see  I went to see 
[04:31:30]  something where  what's the black lady  on  she's the  she's on  Law and Order  she's like the  detective  no  she's like the boss  she's like the lieutenant  on one of those shows  I don't think  it's  whatever  I don't care  she did  it was just like  no  no  no more  Avenue Q  I don't give a  I just want to stand up  and say I don't give  I don't care  what else did I  drag myself  to see  I don't  I'm surprised 
[04:32:00]  every time  somebody comes  to see me  do comedy  every time  AIDS  Effer writes  musicals make me  hate humanity  I saw  Les Mis  really  which is just like  oh boy  a period piece  and then they're just  oh god  I don't get it  singing the whole thing  the whole thing  is just like singing  I saw Phantom  oh  oh  Anthem of the Opera  if it's not  Lon Chaney  making that  bald face 
[04:32:30]  yeah  if it ain't him  I think I saw  Robert England's  Phantom of the Opera  and it was  it was the dumbest  thing I was  if it ain't Lon Chaney  making that scary  goofy face  I don't want to see  I don't  movies  I'm  I'm a big movie guy  yeah  but live entertainment  I don't  I just don't get it  ain't  ain't cutting it for you  no man  I'm sorry  I'm  I'm sorry  I guess  you gotta be 
[04:33:00]  a certain mode  you never get a good seat  you gotta stand  the whole time  I saw The Little Mermaid  on Broadway  how are you seeing all these  what's going on here  I had to  every time I  I've said  I've been to Broadway  it's been because  I've been dragged there  by some broad  yeah let me think about it  did I ever go to  Broadway  that's why they call it  Broadway  wow what a revelation  you're absolutely right  it's Broadway  because some stupid broad  drags all the guys 
[04:33:30]  to these stupid shows  you make a good point  I'm going to an  off bitch avenue show  C  C word way  I'm sitting  I'm sitting here thinking  oh  did I ever  give my regards to  c***  way  remember me  in Herald Square  give my regards to  c***  way  you know  you make a good point  because I'm sitting here thinking  did I ever  like  search out  anything on Broadway  and go 
[04:34:00]  because I wanted to see something  yeah  it was always a broad  ex-girlfriend  yep  a mother  a sister  dragging you to something  worst thing  I ever went to  was there one show  you went to  on your own  saying I really want to see this  not one  worst one  I was ever dragged to  was with my  ex-mother-in-law  Judy  Judy is now  dead  but she  I was here  which means  Lon and Wally  Lon and Wally  up in Boston 
[04:34:30]  but no  it was down  here in New York  they had come to visit  Ani Mog  was here  who's dead also  and my ex-wife  Jennifer  and I got dragged  to the  Radio City  Christmas show  oh  dude  dude  dude  oh look  they're dressed like  wooden soldiers  and they fall  in a line  oh look at that  now they're doing  the kick line 
[04:35:00]  here it is  the big kick line  you had to sit through  a can-can  dude  it was the  and then the live  nativity  with all the animals  they bring out  look a camel  on stage  there's a camel  on the stage  if you go to that show  you should be forced  to have something  in your can-can  and then they're saying  all the Christmas songs  and the friggin  I sat there  I was  it was torture  it was torture  to sit there  oh god  the place is gigantic  I'm in the middle  somewhere  I didn't even care 
[04:35:30]  that I couldn't see  but I couldn't see  you know  it was  just another thing  I was dragged to  I've been dragged to everything  I won't do it no more  my girl  we had a relationship crisis  cause I won't go see  Wicked with her  I saw Wicked  and she keeps explaining  to me  I've seen every  god effing show  on Broadway  it's the Wizard of Oz  but it's from the  evil witch's point of view  shut up  let me ruin the ending  she's friends with  the good witch  and they planned  the whole thing  so the wicked witch  could run off  with some guy  I'll see the movie 
[04:36:00]  interesting rated R  and it better not be  PG-13 Wicked  it better be rated R  it's really  the bad witch  ends up being  really the good witch  it was all a trick  yeah yeah  it was a trick  the monkeys  no one died  no one died  there was no wicked witch  the wicked witch  was good  the wicked witch  was good  what the f  I won't go  but it's called Wicked  no  see  tricked you  just like I was  tricked into going  there's a play  Wicked  Wicked 
[04:36:30]  it just  that's every girl  in the audience  and you went to see Wicked  I saw Wicked  and the Philly crew  and the Long Island crew  got together  to go to Wicked  it wasn't even  in the thought process  to ask us guys  it was  no you're just going  it was for the girls  you're going  I've been to so many  and like you said  every one of them  I've been dragged to  is that going to happen  again with me  nope  has it been one  tell the truth  has it been one  you were close to liking  but you just  your man  wouldn't let you fully like it  I liked Young Frankenstein 
[04:37:00]  I really did  I saw it because  they were advertisers  and I definitely liked it  I saw  I saw the Wedding Singer  with Stephen Lynch  and I liked that too  because it's  it's just because  Stephen was in it  I never would have seen that  if Stephen Lynch  wasn't in it  oh absolutely not  you're right  I wouldn't have cared  you're right  I have to be biased  did you enjoy it  I'm biased because  I like Stephen  and Stephen did a good job  in it  but the play itself  let's take Stephen  out of the equation  sucked  okay  oh yeah yeah  I would never see that 
[04:37:30]  I saw Rocky  Rocky Horror  Rocky Horror  with what's his name  from Skid Row  Tim Curry  was in it  no that's  Sebastian Bach  he was in the other one  yeah he was in that too  Jekyll and Hyde  I was dragged to that one  back in the day  Sebastian Bach's got a great voice  so like to hear him sing  was cool  but like I  I don't want to sit for that  I went to Cats  like three times  with three different bitches  girl way  enough  broad  broad way  I thought  Cats clothes 
[04:38:00]  let me tell you this  white trash  friggin Long Island  piece of crap  weekend I had  years ago  it was me  and the ex-wife  and we were going  to the big city  we were leaving  the constraints  of the island  and going to the big city  to go see Cats  we're going to Broadway  and people on Broadway  never considered that  a Broadway show  it made  umpteen billion dollars  it lasted for years  and years  because  every Asian 
[04:38:30]  tourist and businessman  packed that audience  for years  Cats  and then it just  petered out  and became this  uh  like  nostalgic thing  it was like some  heavy metal  kind of  uh  thing for the 80s  what was the big song  from Cats  there was a couple  of them  but there was  memories  that the love  that died  didn't make sense  the whole thing  didn't make sense  and one thing  I love  here's what I love 
[04:39:00]  everybody's catty  when you're sitting  in the audience  and the play  comes out  and interacts  with you  oh do I love  that attention  when you get  the cat doodles  right on your lap  row  and the cat  comes out  and starts  pawing at you  I want to kick him  sprays on your seat  oh jeez  is that high  dude I was at a show  and they wanted me  to do the audience  participation  oh yeah  yeah  now the guy's talking 
[04:39:30]  oh god  so my white trash  weekend  insisted of  like I'm taking 
[04:40:00]  the wife out  we're going to see  cats on Broadway  she borrows  a fur coat  to make it look like  where you know  rolling in the dough  yeah  what did Alice  tell Ralph  when they were  looking for a maid  yeah  we're big shots  you know  your scene  your past life  was a scene  from Silence of the Lambs  you know  you know Anthony  with your cheap shoes  and your good bag  you just  you just  one generation 
[04:40:30]  that's why  no one should be mad  at what Anthony's  borrowed fur coat  and your cheap shoes  that's why  no one should be mad  at what Anthony's  doing with his life  right now  because  because he's lived  a horrific  horrific life  in the past  I put on  some horrid  ill-fitting suit  that I had had  since like  my communion  I think  with I believe  a Bugs Bunny tie  dude  it was  awful  I rented  a limo 
[04:41:00]  and we were  going into the city  hey  dinner first  at the Russian  tea room  was part of the package  and it's a package deal  so you don't go in  and order something  they just give you  it's like  oh here come  the schlep trash  from Long Island  we give them  you know  this food  deviled eggs  yeah  just horrid stuff  chicken bone marrow  and rice  that's what it was  just like this garbage  don't forget the beets  just beets  chicken bone marrow  and a slice of  cheesecake 
[04:41:30]  yes  with fake cherries  on top of it  and then they usher you out  because you're going to be  late for the show  you know  so back into the limo  and then we pull in front  of the Winter Garden Theater  and I'm like  I'm thinking  alright  I'm getting out of a limo  in front of the Winter Garden  is people going to think  I'm somebody  no they're not  you're just another  Long Island douche  so I just get out  and we go in  and see this  god awful play 
[04:42:00]  and think  we're high rollers  I thought like  that night was like  wait a minute  but you were into this though  you were into this night  yeah that  for me  that was my high roll  I told my family  it's like hey  that's what we're doing  you didn't know any better  taking a limo  into the city  to go see cats  borrowing the fur coat though  she borrowed a fur coat  and I was just like  in this bat  the suit was awful  didn't fit me  it was horrid  someone is asking  about Cirque du Soleil  well now 
[04:42:30]  that's not really  considered Broadway  no that's different  I've seen a couple  of those in Vegas  those things  are effing amazing  yeah they're doing something  they're amazing  yeah they bend up  and  yeah yeah  that's different  it's not some silly  some Chinese girl  is spinning plates  on her face  I mean that's entertainment  where would you put  place a blue man group  I saw a blue man group  so did I  yuck  what's the hype  with the pipes  it was pipes

[04:43:30]  you're hypnotizing  the audience  this is supposed  to just  hypnotize you  he's playing  a PVC pipe  he's playing plumbing  that slides in  and out of each other  so it makes  a different tone  when he hits on it  and I'm sitting there  going okay  for the first  two seconds  you're kind of like  wow that's cool  he's playing PVC  and then again  you're just sitting  going how long  is this gonna go on  how long  how about the  trash can lids  people  yeah oh  stomp 
[04:44:00]  or no the other one  was it stomp  yeah look  they're playing  trash cans  and spackle buckets  I can see this  in Times Square  but nothing  I can see this  while I'm waiting  for the C train  why do I have to  pay $100  no interest  I'm sorry  nothing right  no interest  people would probably  see this though  they're probably angry  yeah  because it's like  I guess if somebody  like  I don't  somebody who didn't  see the Godfather  and goes  I don't get it  you just go  what are you  what's wrong with you  crazy  how many times  have you just  said can we eat now
