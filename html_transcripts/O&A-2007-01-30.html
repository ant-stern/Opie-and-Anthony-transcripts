<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with vulgar and sexually explicit banter between Opie, Anthony, and guest Jim Norton.  Opie discussed his successful avoidance of the flu, contrasting his health with the illnesses of others.  The hosts then tackled angry listener responses to their American Idol segments, with accusations of payola flying and insults exchanged. Opie expressed frustration with online criticism. A caller then discussed the annual homeless population count, prompting a discussion about homelessness and societal perceptions.  A humorous advertisement for a fictional Tom Jones album, "Tippy Tom Regurgitated," was played.

Jim Norton recounted his bizarre and negatively viewed Sacramento experiences, detailing a wild childhood involving bull riding, firearms, and early alcohol consumption, describing it as both a dream and a trauma.  The hosts then discussed a woman beaten into a coma after attempting to forcefully enter a Hells Angels clubhouse, focusing on her poor judgment.  A YouTube video of a deaf person performing karaoke was played, prompting attempts to identify the song and plans for a "deaf karaoke day" with dentists providing Novocaine. The hosts greeted their "Pests out West" fan group.

Opie recounted a contentious interaction with poker player Daniel Negreanu during a televised poker tournament, detailing the subsequent online fallout and Joe Rogan's involvement.  The euthanasia of racehorse Barbaro was discussed, contrasting the media attention with the ongoing Iraq War. A caller clarified rules on thoroughbred horse insemination.  Further discussion of Daniel Negreanu's negative journal entry about his experience on the show followed, with the hosts defending their chaotic and unpredictable style, citing Joe Rogan's juvenile behavior, Jim Norton's lack of poker knowledge, and past negative reactions from guests like Ed Asner.  Anecdotes included a naked woman visible outside the studio window and promotion of their "deaf karaoke" CD of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody."

A segment heavily focused on mocking deaf news reporter Karen Meyer's delivery, with disparaging remarks from hosts and callers.  Colin Hanks and Jack Black were mentioned as being present in the studio when a topless midget photo was shown on-air. The discussion shifted to Meyer's "Crip Slam Sunday" event, with further criticism and suggestions for alternative employment.  Listener calls, including some expressing offense, were interspersed with jokes and discussion of a nonsensical roller skating news story. A public service announcement about child sexual abuse was played, prompting cynical commentary from the hosts.  The segment concluded with an extended discussion of one of the hosts' anxieties and insecurities regarding his relationship and his girlfriend's past sexual experiences, including crude sexual references and self-reflection, with Louie CK mentioned as being in the studio.

A caller, Jimmy, detailed his recurring anxieties involving imagined infidelities and perceived shortcomings with his girlfriend, focusing on his penis size.  Several other callers shared similar experiences, describing their own invented scenarios leading to intense emotions, often involving imagined betrayals and violence.  Lindsay shared a non-sexual childhood fantasy involving being hurt by Kiss and comforted.  The conversation touched upon Stockholm Syndrome.  Charlie in Philly and Jason also shared similar scenarios, often focusing on imagined infidelity. A UFC betting segment between E-Rock and Bill, with a Brazilian wax as the prize, and discussion of Mirko "Cro Cop" was included.  Don recited a sexually explicit poem about his ex-wife, leading to an uncomfortable conclusion. Louis C.K. was again mentioned as being in the studio.

The show continued with harsh criticism of Don's poem from Indiana, followed by an extremely vulgar and offensive discussion of Tyra Banks' reaction to paparazzi photos, using derogatory terms like "fat pig" and "rancid cunt." Her television show and its impact on young women were also discussed.  The hosts then brainstormed ideas for their "So Your Pussy's Got Talent" segment, involving Rube Goldberg machines and a marble triggering a finger entering a vagina. The show concluded with the "Line of the Day" segment and further vulgar commentary.

[00:04:00]  this is stupid can't too many people know when we take off huh too many people know and you know  we can't take off it's not like a real real job you know you call your boss i feel good today  yeah i'm not coming in okay well feel better we'll see you uh tomorrow click and that's it  they never believe the guys at work kind of know but for the most part that's it here it's like  where is he speculation thread they didn't show up i think it was because the bit they did yesterday 
[00:04:30]  they got in trouble for and shut up it went on a tear yesterday i was the biggest cranky little  whiny mess yesterday on message boards on emails to tom on like i was just everything i typed on my  keyboard was caustic i was just mad just pounding away yeah hitting the keyboard hard just all angry  and the thing is because i i decided to uh put a new network router in uh in my house and it's just 
[00:05:00]  always it doesn't matter how simple installation i know what goes into putting a network router in  it it's not that big a deal but i can never just immediately right like they say hook it up get  everything working on a secured network secured wireless networks and no one driving in front of  my house can log into my system uh to secure it and have it work where i'm file sharing and everything 
[00:05:30]  through my pcs and my macs and everything working fine sure i finally get it done and you know i  change the router and try to do it over again and you know coming up with the mac numbers for the  security and i was i was livid hours later i'm just going why why and then i decide to take a little  break and read some of the message boards and check emails and that makes me even more livid oh the  latest one is they're convinced that we're in cahoots with american idol dude this jackass 
[00:06:00]  it's posts like this where i say once again eat your own especially when it's obvious that someone  is just trying to be a you know they were a buzz kill they were they were like it's but it's that  one guy what are you gonna do first of all you can't you can't ban them you can't throw them off  it just signs on under another thing and it says bitching about being thrown off and that but the 
[00:06:30]  other people kind of jumped on board and said dude you know what it what's your problem he get he posts  about american idol and he doesn't like our american idol conversation fine i got no problem with that  and this is where people say and i even posted this this is where people go those guys can't take  criticism because you know i said i didn't like uh the american idol breaks and i get jumped all over  no you could not like anything on the show doesn't matter we can't take him we can't take stupidity 
[00:07:00]  it's opinion it's objective it's it's subjective it's one of those things where some people will find  it funny some won't and there's no right or wrong in that it's just it's your taste in things but then  the a read the post you'll see what i said i wrote the a whole i wrote i just strung together  writes about how he's right that it sucked the break the breaks that we do on american idol  and then how we're in cahoots uh through i guess tom chiasano and the sales department here with 
[00:07:30]  american idol to talk about it they make us talk about it and uh it's some kind of payola thing  so now not only is he blatantly lying he's accusing us of being criminals and accepting  some type of payola money for mentioning a tv show first of all he doesn't even understand how payola  works so i told him to stick to squeezing uh uh the handles at gas pumps and leave everything else to 
[00:08:00]  everybody else and then he informed me i don't pump gas i'm a i'm an exterminator and i imply that he  was breathing in too much insecticide fumes because he's retarded and and he got everything  wrong and it's those posts where it's like well no i'm right no no you're not right we're talking  about a show that did 35 million people yeah we like to talk about a show we like to talk about  things that maybe the audience uh is into and we're not discussing it like hey you know seriously 
[00:08:30]  let's get into american idol what did you think about that we're goofing on it we're doing it in our  inimitable style we give it our own little uh you know horse uh angle or whatever little twist  but then the same idiot will turn around or idiot cohorts on various message boards will turn around  and go those guys man you see just can't take a little criticism that's not called criticism  so i told him to do awful things with his mother's uh uh awful parts 
[00:09:00]  we made fun of the contestants on american idol first like right it has to be clear yeah they  say it's okay tom because the money that american idol spends for us to talk is just huge amounts of  money and if the guy would just listen to the radio show all his questions would be answered uh we  actually all of them we're not in with american idol on any level we're not going to get any american  idol contestants unless something drastically changes because jay moore and anthony called the publicist 
[00:09:30]  for american idol uh the c word yeah more than once so how could we be in cahoots if we're calling  her the c word there's no cahoots during our uh taylor hicks interview last season no cahoots at all  how could we be in cahoots are you kidding me i just want to say cahoots cahoots but it's a cahoots  and we do give it our own twist man talking about that that poor girl's father and how we want to beat  him up see what are the radio shows talking on that level that that had nothing to do with american  idol that could have been any girl on any tv program reality show anything doing that but but you know 
[00:10:00]  it's the guy worded his post like we were doing z100 breaks on american idol right right let's uh hey  we're gonna take your votes who do you think ought to be voted off uh let's so he is like if the powers  it be i believe that yes that was on whack bag on whack bag want to just spank him make it so when 
[00:10:30]  he logs on it goes to that endless loop of male porno and just keeps going and loads his computer up  with it blank the guy just blank case blank cave pictures just just a cave and and gaping and  whatever other pictures of male parts just send it to him keep sending him those fill up his inbox  with the worst male pornography you could possibly find because he's a douche there you go let's say 
[00:11:00]  how to whoa what's going on okay uh dave and riverhead you're on the opian anthony show what's up dave  hey what's happening and a dave people walking around poking homeless people today you know that  yeah poke the homeless day today yeah we're counting the homeless today  yeah they're uh they're counting them they're trying to figure out they wait till the middle of freaking winter  to see how well they're get the homeless or help homeless people they're not helping  they're doing they're not helping here's what goes on and i found this out because we had  we had done the homeless shopping spree and they were counting their homeless in boston 
[00:11:30]  and really fast why do they do it in the middle of winter why won't they do it in the middle of summer  when there are more homeless people out on the streets um it only makes sense for them to look  good all these guys want to do maybe they're less mobile during the winter i think they are they're  kind of easier to find maybe because they're not oh well maybe they're not as confused because  in the middle of summer it could be just a drunk yeah exactly and they kind of some dude with long  hair they're just gonna have a bar hey man i'm not homeless they congregate in the winter in  certain areas that are warm and safe and things like that so i guess they're easier to find and count 
[00:12:00]  and it's uh they did it in boston we caught a bunch of hell because we were running our  homeless shopping spree at the same time they were counting the homeless so they pulled this  hypocritical bullcrap on us that uh we were exploiting the homeless meanwhile what do you think they  count them for uh i don't know they count them because they get federal funding so why can't they  just a certain amount of homeless that they have why can't they just make up the numbers or they  got like some uh they actually go through the motions but dave's right too they have to poke 
[00:12:30]  them yeah you got to make sure it's homeless and not just an empty sleeping bag or a dead homeless  dead homeless doesn't count no i would count the dead homeless guy you got to poke it to see if  there's any life and then you add them to the list you get your money from them add them to the list of  the less fortunate dead he died later the less fortunate one more peon in new york city and even  bloomberg the mayor bloomberg here was saying he goes you know the the shame is uh a lot of the people  on the streets want to be on the streets he goes we'd like we'd like to help them uh but he goes 
[00:13:00]  they don't want to be helped we're on the streets and that's it that's what they want to do they just  want to live on the street so we see we know more about the homeless than probably the mayor of this  city because we live among them we do a lot of bits with them and we talk to these guys when they're  sober and they're like look these shelters gonna go a little serious now these shelters are awful  places they've told us that they're safer on the streets of new york than some of these shelters  that's where the homeless families go the people that are down in their luck that did have jobs and 
[00:13:30]  things like that trying to get their crap together again uh that's where they go but uh the homeless  you see on the street they they want to be there it's their life it's the way they live it's like you  go to work and then go home they panhandle and go into a box at night and that's what they consider  their life all right fellas i gotta run start my truck and get rolling here so i don't end up  homeless all right dave thank you tell us everything turn the key hit the gas what else do you want to  tell us if uh if you got something for the show 1-866-313-FREE we say hi to mike in smithtown

For some reason, they only like 80s music.  I don't know why.  Yeah, it was a whole bit.  The Bohemian Rhapsody, the boys took it,  and they made something out of it.  Yeah.  Later on this morning, we'll play that for you as well.  Jim Norton back from on the road.  He was in Sacramento over the weekend  hearing nothing but rave reviews, Jimmy.  It was lovely.  Yes. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, it was lovely.  What a dumpy town Sacramento is.  Really?  No offense.  It's like Albany on the West Coast.  Oh.  Kind of just depressing and silly.  They have nothing to be proud of.  Oh, certainly don't.  San Francisco's so close and so much better.  It's just like, just in the middle of nowhere.  I drove through Sacramento going to the West Coast when we had our time off.  And he is right.  Oh, yeah.  No reason to stop.  That's what I did.  I think I found a Starbucks.  Drove through it.  I found a Starbucks because I needed some coffee to stay awake. 
[00:20:00]  That's what they were good for.  I had to pick up a fire truck with my father.  Yeah?  In Sacramento.  Why were you guys picking up a fire truck?  Well, there was this thing my father was involved with.  Oh, many occupations.  You know, he never held a job.  Oh, boy.  Here we go.  Never held a job too long.  Yeah.  And one of his occupations as a welder was he was putting together these things that went  on the back of these fire trucks where the fire department could fill the oxygen tanks  on site. 
[00:20:30]  So if there's a fire and they need a lot of oxygen, they could fill their tanks on site.  So they had these, you know, you got to fill the tanks in water.  So they had this whole rig that was put together and went on the fire truck.  And there was a prototype fire truck that he had to bring down from Sacramento all the  way back down to Capistrano, which is like between San Diego and L.A.  So he goes, you know, take a ride with me.  So I'm like, all right.  So we drove up in a rental car and then drove back down in a fire truck with him driving,  of course, drinking and like half an hour into the trip. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  We're like drinking beers and the sirens and lights are coming on and we're just going  down, going over what they call the grapevine out there, you know, and just like drinking  beer and just having a blast.  You know, fire truck.  You know, you had the greatest childhood ever, right?  Oh, no, I realize it's from a broken family.  No doubt.  It twisted me a little. 
[00:21:30]  It twisted me a little.  But it was like if you look at it from the outside, it's a kid's like wildest dream come  true.  Everything that a kid wanted to do, I pretty much got to do like these wild things with  guns and fire trucks and dune buggies and girls and and horses drinking like it was a  great thing.  But then being part of it at the time, it was like traumatizing.  But, you know, now that I'm an adult and can look back on it, it's like, wow, that was 
[00:22:00]  that was a childhood.  You know, that was like a wild childhood.  Yeah.  Anthony was shooting guns at what, 11, 12?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like hunting.  Lost his virginity at 13.  Yeah.  To a girl that his father brought him.  Well, she was a friend of the family.  She was 19.  I told that story, by the way, over the weekend.  Did you?  Oh, God.  Huge laughs over your horrific upbringing.  My awkwardness.  When did you realize you could get away with anything with your dad?  You know, it was weird because his priorities were so screwy that I couldn't get away with 
[00:22:30]  everything.  Like I could do things that were just, you know, he would let me do things that were ridiculous.  Like here, stay on this bull for eight seconds and you could drink a beer.  Okay.  Okay.  So I'd get on and they weren't full-size Brahma bulls, but they were, you know, mid-size Brahma.  But you weren't a full-size human either.  No, I wasn't.  And it wasn't like a bull riding place either.  It was just pretty much a riding arena and jump on this bull and, you know, hold on to 
[00:23:00]  the rope and they let you out of the gate.  And, you know, I'm on my ass in like four seconds and he gives me a beer anyway.  So it kind of made me feel good.  How old were you?  13, 14, around there.  So it was one of those situations where I couldn't get away with stuff like that, but  he would like get real pissed if, like my brother was smoking pot at the time and he  found some pot on my brother and that was just it.  He'd like poo smack in the face.  Or then, you know, he was so irresponsible with money and everything. 
[00:23:30]  So there were like nights where I'd be starving.  Like there's no food to eat.  The horses had hay.  But plenty of money for drinking.  We didn't have it.  Yeah.  There was like plenty of tall boy buds for him and everything.  Plenty of drinks around and plenty of food for the horses.  Like, hey, Pop, we eating tonight?  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  They find something in the cabinet and I'm looking around at like rice and frigging like a potato  and all with eyes growing out of it.  It was horrid.  You grew up on the set of Mice and Men. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, it was.  I swear.  It was.  So one time I grabbed these quarters out of his room and went down to the thrifty drug  and discount store out there for you California listeners and grabbed a handful of quarters  and bought some ice cream sandwiches, a whole box.  And I just sat behind the store and ate every single ice cream sandwich in there.  And he realized I had stolen the quarters. 
[00:24:30]  And he goes, what did you spend it on?  I was like, I was hungry.  I bought ice cream sandwiches and I ate them.  And he was like, I bet you bought some of those goddamn model rockets because I was into  model rocketry at the time.  And his hand just wham right across my face.  And the only reason.  And I'm like, oh, no.  You know, I was hungry and I bought the goddamn ice cream sandwiches.  And he hit you because that was his beer money.  That was probably the beer money.  And that's why I pissed off.  Hey, let's say hi to Mike in Cleveland.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I just got to tell you guys, I love the deaf karaoke. 
[00:25:00]  You do, huh?  Oh, yeah.  It's the best.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  No problem.  Speaking of deaf karaoke, we played this late in the show yesterday.  This is an actual deaf person doing karaoke on YouTube.  We're still trying to figure out what song he's singing here.  We're thinking Patience by Guns N' Roses.  We're thinking Baby I Love Your Way by Peter Frampton.  We're thinking Knocking on Heaven's Door.  I had an answer somebody gave me last night on MySpace.  Really?  I forgot.  All right.  Well, let's take a listen here. 
[00:25:30]  I'm trying to think.  And help us out.  We're trying to figure out what he is singing right here.  The car sounds so familiar.  I'm trying to figure out what he is singing right here. 
[00:26:00]  I'm trying to figure out what he is singing right here.  That's like a basset hound.  Chasing prisoners. 
[00:26:30]  That's not a lyric.  See, those aren't words.  It has to be words for it to be a song.  I have no idea.  It sounds a little bit like Knocking on Heaven's Door, the guitar work, or a little Patience  by Guns N' Roses.  Yeah.  But we're trying to figure out what he's singing there.  Is that a goof or is that somebody really singing?  No, that's really a deaf karaoke. 
[00:27:00]  It's a deaf person.  By the way, we got two dentists that will give people Novocaine for our deaf karaoke day.  Ooh.  We're doing deaf karaoke day.  We're numbing up some tongues and some lips and some mouths.  Just numb up the mouth and have him try to sing.  Oh.  Hysterical.  But two dentists actually got a hold of Steve and said, yes, I will come in.  Yep.  And I will do the Novocaine for you guys.  Speaking of Sacramento, I forgot. 
[00:27:30]  We got to say hi to the POWs.  What?  Well, we have PES.  ONA PES.  We all know about the PES.  They're like hardcore fans.  Some of them are Uber fans.  Yep.  Because they like that term too.  Uber fans.  But now there's POWs.  Pests of the West.  Or Pests out West.  Pests out West.  Pests out West.  Whatever it is.  It really kind of downplays what the real POWs went through. 
[00:28:00]  I feel the real POWs are downplaying the importance of the PES.  But I guess there were like 50 or so at your shows over the weekend.  I did see a lot of fans.  This is what I was zero.  I actually recognized one guy from his picture on Wack Bag.  Right.  Wow.  You were posting on Wack Bag, didn't you?  He goes, yeah.  I recognize him.  How do you do that?  You see some of these guys and you go, wow, you're famous.  Yeah.  They introduce themselves.  I know you.  They go, wow, you are a fat guy.  I thought so.  But they're giving each other numbers and there's an organization out there called Pests 
[00:28:30]  out West.  Pests out West.  So there you go.  I just want to say hi to them because they went to your shows.  A lot of them went to your shows there, Jimmy.  Let's say hi to 33 Across.  Hey, boys.  That deaf guy sounded like he was singing Wild Horses.  Yeah.  Someone suggested Wild Horses yesterday.  We got another one guessing, knocking on heaven's door.  Yeah.  The guitar is pretty generic.  It could be a few songs and you cannot tell one thing from the vocals except maybe somebody's 
[00:29:00]  taking a pair of pliers to his nether region.  That's what you would sound like.  That's what any normal man would sound like if pliers were applied to that area and twisted  180 degrees.  Let's go to Steve in Yonkers.  Steve.  Hey, what's up?  I thought maybe it was Behind Blue Eyes, sung by his dog.  Behind Blue Eyes by the who?  Behind Blocked Ears.  All right.  We're trying to figure that out. 
[00:29:30]  I don't know if we're ever going to get the answer because it's just so unrecognizable.  Does he even have ears?  They should take them off when you're born if they're not going to work.  Just spackle them over.  Oh, the Hells Angels story.  This is the stupidest woman in New York.  Yeah.  Dalt.  A drunken woman celebrating her 52nd birthday was beaten into a coma as she tried to push  her way into the Hells Angels clubhouse in the East Village. 
[00:30:00]  That's what you do.  You try to push your way into that place.  That place, by the way, not many disturbances go on over there.  None.  It is a very safe area.  The Hells Angels take care of that area.  Neighborhood watch.  No what they call shenanigans going on.  That's a hell of a neighborhood watch.  Kind of like John Gotti's old neighborhood.  Exactly.  There is no crimes in that area.  No one's screwing around.  Same with where this club is for the Hells Angels.  They take care of the neighborhood. 
[00:30:30]  And that's because that street right there might as well be the main street in Deadwood.  That's how justice is carried out.  Yeah.  There's no real law.  It's just whatever they feel they have to do to keep their street the way it is, they  will do it.  Would you ever try to get into a Hells Angels club?  If I was invited, I would very cordially turn down the invite.  Well, yeah, because this story gets really good.  I mean, I would maybe at the best just, guys, guys, can I come in? 
[00:31:00]  No.  And then I'd walk away.  I'm really not part of that whole thing.  I have a complete respect for those gentlemen, but I certainly, I'm not, like, part of that  mindset.  But as soon as they say, go away, you're out of there.  Yeah.  Well, this woman, uh...  This is great.  Listen to this escalation.  She got into a screaming match with a female biker as members of the New York and California 
[00:31:30]  chapters of the crew, hobnobbed at the Edge Bar, blah, blah, blah.  Shalabi, her name was Roberta Shalabi, got into it with a woman dating one of the Californians  and followed the bikers as they left.  She followed Hell's Angels who were just trying to leave.  That's what you do.  You'll show them.  And they probably just didn't want to kill her.  So they're like, just enough with this bitch.  And they're leaving.  Because there really is no just kind of teaching you a lesson.  It's either walk away or die.  She had a confrontation with another woman, which is bad enough. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  And then that confrontation ends and she goes, screw that.  I'm following these guys.  So she follows them.  So she follows them back to their clubhouse.  She tailed the bikers to their clubhouse on East 3rd Street where she banged on the door  and be demanded to let in.  To be let in.  What the hell does she think she's knocking on?  I don't know.  But if they went inside and they're like, enough with you.  Why don't you just go home?  It's your birthday.  There's some crazy broad outside.  Can you believe she's banging on the door here at the Hell's Angels clubhouse?  She screamed, you mother, you mother effer, let me in. 
[00:32:30]  She screamed.  Someone from the second floor of the club leaned out and told her to shut up.  Of course.  Hey, shut up.  It was real late at night.  Shut up.  And she should have shut up and walked away at that point.  Well, she didn't.  She said, come down here and say it like a man.  Oh, boy.  I gather he said, hey, you're a little too tough for me.  Shut the window and let her be, right?  Well, according to the Daily News, someone then came out of the club  and beat her unconscious. 
[00:33:00]  How can anybody prosecute the jury not look at that and go,  she's begging to be beat unconscious?  She is so begging.  And this is where we got to point out where we're so much different  than any other radio show.  They're reading this story and saying how tragic it is.  And we're saying, yeah, of course it's tragic, but she's a dummy.  She's an idiot.  It's like going to the zoo, hopping in the lion's cage in a steak dress.  She's wearing a steak dress and wondering why the lions bit her. 
[00:33:30]  Come out and say it like a man?  Yeah.  Come out and say it.  She's challenging a Hells Angels manhood.  And that's how you say it like a man.  With a baseball bat.  And I'm sure there were other guys that heard her, too.  Like, oh, you're going to take that?  And, yeah, beat her into a coma.  Left her on the street.  They just left her on the street.  They could have left her for dead, said daughter Michelle Caruso, 24.  Oh, really?  Michelle Caruso? 
[00:34:00]  They just left her on the street, Frank.  They could have left her for dead.  Describe my mother as a poet and rock and roll devotee.  Is that some of our poetry?  You mother effer let me in.  For now, I would like to perform my next poem called Come Down Here and Say It Like a Man. 
[00:34:30]  Oh, look, they're applauding on her skull.  Roses are red, violets are black and blue, just like my eyes.  Stupid.  What a dope.  Oh, she is stupid.  And I guess when the police got the call, they responded with helicopters and riot gear and everything that went down there.  And there was a bit of a standoff with the police until the police got a search warrant so they could go into the establishment. 
[00:35:00]  But then I guess everything ended peacefully.  And their lawyer, Ron Cooby, is Hells Angels' lawyer, said it was another attempt to harass the Hells Angels.  And the police response was overkill.  I don't know.  When you got a beaten woman outside and you don't know what the circumstances are, you know, you got to respond like you have to respond.  You got to be let in.  There's a crime committed.  You got to figure out what happened.  That's what the police were doing.  When you realize what this idiot broad was doing, you go, all right, you walk away. 
[00:35:30]  She had three opportunities to leave.  What a dope.  She didn't have to follow him.  Then they told her to go away.  Yeah.  She didn't go away.  And then she says, come on down here and talk to me.  Like a man.  Like a man.  Like a man.  Okay.  This is how a man with a Hells Angels jacket.  This is how we talk to people.  Yeah.  Let's go to Tom in Brooklyn.  Tom, what's up?  Jim.  I don't know where he got Tom.  Jim, Tom.  It's just a little curl at the end of the T.  Is it M?  You know, this story is actually tragic for the five angels that got taken out in handcuffs yesterday. 
[00:36:00]  Only one did I hurt.  Only one got arrested.  Well, one got arrested, but they took five of them out in handcuffs.  Yeah, they took five out and then arrested one.  Stupidity.  That little neighborhood on East 3rd Street, I've driven by that clubhouse many times.  You know, it's those Hells Angels on the door.  And there's like, you can see security cameras watching.  And, you know, I had a problem down there one night where I had to knock on the door and say,  could you move these motorbikes?  I'd like to park my Saturn.  And could you move your little scooters?  Yes, and they had to go out and move their motorcycles because I was parking my Saturn. 
[00:36:30]  They certainly should.  And I bumped one of the bikes and I told the man, if there's a scratch on my fender, there's going to be a problem.  And thank God it was all settled.  I feel nervous laughter.  Oh, boy.  I hope they have a sense of it.  Mike in Pittsburgh, what's up?  Hey, that deaf karaoke, I believe that gal was singing Every Rose Has a Thorn.  I was thinking Every Rose Has a Thorn.  It sounds like the guitar part, but, you know, the vocals is nothing there recognizable. 
[00:37:00]  Stop it.  It's my happy birthday.  That's what she sounded like being beaten with a guitar playing in the background.  Every Rose Has Its Thorns.  Maybe he's doing the guitar part. 
[00:37:30]  All right.  No, it's close.  Give me some Every Rose Has a Thorn.  All right, we can't.  We don't have time to go through the whole freaking song.  I wish he would bang on the Hells Angels door.  Sounds like he did.  Go bang on the Hells Angels door. 
[00:38:00]  Well, yeah, that's absolutely a tragic story today.  Tragic.  But stupidity.  Sometimes you've got to know when to walk away.  Yeah.  Sometimes you've got to just know to just.  A lot of people are giving the cops grief for their response.  How could you give them grief?  That is a situation where you've got to go in there, and for everyone's safety, you go in like that.  That's Anthony Cumia talking.  No, I'm just saying.  I'm not saying bust up the joint or harass people, but for both parties' safety, you have to cuff certain people. 
[00:38:30]  You don't arrest them.  If need be, you do.  But some people have to be cuffed for their own safety and for the police while they get to the bottom of things.  And again, this woman sounds like she's an idiot that should have walked away.  Yeah, I don't find it to be tragic.  It's tragic if you're walking and you step on a guy's foot, and he's a hell's angel, and six of them hit you.  Right.  That's tragic.  Yeah.  If you knock on their door and say, you're basically saying, could you come punch me in the face, please? 
[00:39:00]  It's my birthday.  Right.  Happy birthday.  Whammo.  Yeah, you're not going to have a cute little debate on the sidewalk.  Yeah, she followed them back.  Right.  She's dumb.  Hey, Bill in Philly, what's up?  The name of the song is Help Us by Crosby, Stills, Mesh, and Young.  Or Neil Young.  How can you tell?  I just know the song well.  All right, let's get Help Us.  Let's hear...  Is it Help Us or Help Us?  Help Us.  From the second album.  All right, so I know you have to argue.  You can really hear Help Us in there? 
[00:39:30]  I certainly can.  Big fan of Neil Young.  All right.  All right, hold on the line there.  All right.  You got it there or you rock?  Should be a song called Useless, and then it'd just be about his iPod buds.  He's singing a song about everything that's useless in his life.  Just walking around his apartment pointing at things and singing, Useless.  Volume control.  All right, Bill, just stay in the line, but be quiet.  We're going to play a little piece of Helpless by Neil Young. 
[00:40:00]  Sounds like the singing, too.  By the way, Bill, what part is he singing?  The chorus.  Oh, the chorus?  All right, we'll get into the chorus.  There is a town in North Ontario  Dream, comfort, memory, despair  Love Neil Young, by the way. 
[00:40:30]  He is good.  In my mind  It would be nice to hear these songs when he's in concert, but you won't.  You won't.  All my changes were there  Here we go.  You rock song, Useless.  Blue, blue window  Get to the chorus.  The second little verse  Yellow moon on the rise  Yellow moon on the rise 
[00:41:00]  Big birds flying across the sky  Here it comes.  It's coming.  Here we go.  Throwing shadows on our eyes  Leave us helpless, helpless, helpless  Peerless, peerless 
[00:41:30]  Oh, my God, I'm trying.  Maybe this song is Help Us and it's his neighbors knocking on the wall.  You know what?  Bill might be on to it.  Yeah, the music's kind of right. 
[00:42:00]  Yellow moon on the rise  It's kind of there.  But this guy's a terrible singer.  He's like singing when there's nothing.  Yeah  Might be.  Hey, Bill, you might have figured it out.  The music is right.  The vocals, sorry. 
[00:42:30]  That's what you want to call them.  That's not bad, though, to figure out the guitar work.  He wants everyone to be deaf and just thrust ice picks in their ears.  They don't have to listen to that anymore.  I say we got the answer.  It's helpful.  Until I hear anything better, yeah.  Very good, Bill.  I'm punching out.  All right, there he goes.  Bill from Philly.  That's a lovely song by Neil Young.  That's the advantage, too, of living the life of being so centered on one little group of music.  Now I'm finding all this new stuff, and it's all from 1977. 
[00:43:00]  New stuff that's 40 years old.  I'm such an ass.  That's great.  What is that called?  Knocking on Heaven's Door?  You idiot.  All right.  Want to figure out something else today?  I'll give the people an easy one going in to break.  That was hard.  Riddle day.  It's riddle day.  It's riddle day on the Opie and Anthony show.  What is going on?  Riddle Tuesday.  What is going on in this fine clip?  The faithful listeners know.  The new listeners will be driven crazy today. 
[00:43:30]  We're lit.  We're lit.  We're lit.  Oh, my God.  And shoot.  Shoot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was beautiful.  It was beautiful.  Oh, yeah.  She fired a bottle rocket.  Yeah.  That was a good one. 
[00:44:00]  Taking it right to the edge today.  A bottle rocket.  Hey, do we have that video anywhere?  That was like the Mission Control's response when they heard the eagle had landed.  Jesus.  That's a bottle rocket, people.  We're all, yeah.  Tears coming out of our eyes, patting each other on the back, smelly bottle rocket.  We took it right to the edge, didn't we, Al?  Okay, Al.  What do you say, Al?  Are we okay, Al?  Okay, launch the bottle rocket.  We faded just in time, right, Al? 
[00:44:30]  What do you say, Al?  What do you say?  Hey, is that video up?  All right, you're going to get some hits today there, Steve.  It's up on opiananthony.com.  The answer to that riddle is up on opiananthony.com.  Classic.  And we will continue.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Virus.  Good morning. 
[00:45:00]  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Today's the day, right, boys?  Yes, Vista released today for Windows.  I'm psyched.  No!  Oh, sorry.  Look, I get a little laugh out of a tech head.  Are you upgrading, my friend?  Oh, Vista, you.  He's becoming a regular.  Louis C.K. in studio.  And today's the day.  Lucky Louis on DVD, man.  Yes.  Go out and get it.  Go buy it.  It's an actual story.  Absolutely.  That's very exciting for you guys. 
[00:45:30]  Extras.  Commentary?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Nice.  Yeah.  I handed out 10 to my friends over the weekends.  Oh, good.  I hope you don't mind.  Oh, good.  10 people that aren't going to buy it now.  No, they would have.  Yeah, they would have bought it, too.  They would have.  They would have bought it.  Jesus Christ, though.  Huge fans.  I'm like, oh, save the money.  Here it is.  Trying to run a business over here.  Exactly what they don't want to hear.  That's all right.  But it's still getting the product out there for you.  Exactly.  Lucky Louis on DVD today.  I don't know where you can buy it because Tower Records is closed.  I guess Best Buy.  Yeah.  Best Buy is a biggie. 
[00:46:00]  Order off Amazon also.  No, I'm just thinking for the people that still like to go into stores.  There are people like that left?  They're called old people, by the way.  Circuit City, probably, right?  Yeah, Circuit City.  That's a store I still go into.  Yeah.  Very few stores I actually go into these days.  I do all my stuff online.  But Circuit City, I will go in.  Place like Best Buy.  I'll go in there because I like just looking at new.  I like the smell of new electronics.  Yeah.  I just go around sniffing the electronics until I get chased out.  You guys talking about Barbaro? 
[00:46:30]  Stupid Barbaro?  I was just about to say, we try to keep everyone informed because they're just waking up.  And the story today is about a horse.  Today's top story is about Barbaro.  Poor Barbaro.  We got soldiers dying every day in Iraq, but they're making a big deal about finally putting  this horse to rest.  Well, you know, they kept him alive probably a lot longer than they had to just to get  as much studding out of him as they probably could.  Some guy with a big glove.  That's what we...  I know.  I know.  Totally talking about it.  They kept him alive for eight...  That was eight months ago. 
[00:47:00]  Eight months ago.  It's been on the news.  And you know what?  His injury, they should have put him down that afternoon.  Apparently, they played the clip of the beginning of the race before the race even started.  He had bashed through the gate.  And then they backed him back into the gate, but apparently it already injured his leg.  And then when the race started, he just completely screwed it up.  Yeah.  The ankle just went, whatever they call it, in the back.  And on a horse, so many joints back there.  Knees bent backwards. 
[00:47:30]  You're like creepy animals.  And he wound up screwing up his leg really badly.  But they kept him alive.  And a lot of people are wondering why.  You know how much...  That is like an ATM machine.  A horse ATM that is very awkward to withdraw from.  Absolutely.  You know, and God knows what happened.  He must have just run out.  And that's why they finally decided to euthanize him.  Well, you know, you're going to get the breeders calling in now. 
[00:48:00]  Because we said this one other time.  And they said that they can't do that.  Why?  They need him healthy.  I don't know.  They need him healthy.  You don't get broken leg semen.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not like, yeah, oh, look at that.  It's a broken leg.  Believe me.  You think they were collecting.  Collecting the entire time.  Why else spend eight months keeping this horse alive, knowing that it's never going to race  again.  And it probably won't even live.  It seems like an awful thing.  Like, I enjoy hand relief myself.  Who doesn't? 
[00:48:30]  But if people just walked up to you at just random parts of it, they just started telling  you, hey, okay, not exactly now.  Perfect.  Okay.  All right.  I'm hard now.  Especially if you're, imagine if you're in the hospital in a cast and your legs in traction.  You're just like, all right, well.  Come on.  What's up?  You're not making it.  Here comes Tom.  You have info on this?  I have info on this.  Oh.  All right.  Thoroughbreds cannot be artificially inseminated.  Oh.  They could not withdraw any semen from that horse and use it.  They had, it has to be natural.  Why is that? 
[00:49:00]  I don't know, but that's, that's the rule.  That's part of the rules, right?  Oh, it's the rules.  I thought it was a biological thing.  Those are the rules in Thoroughbreds.  So they were trying to get it healthy enough so he could do it the natural way.  Put him out to stud.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, they probably still collected just to sell for other things.  They just can't use it.  Sell for what?  They would genetically manipulate probably.  I don't know.  Dip?  I don't know.  What are you selling it for, you idiot?  To make Donald's special sauce.  People can make horses like him, even if you can't have Thoroughbreds.  At least you can have a horse like that.  So in the end, if they, you know, that's a really big justification. 
[00:49:30]  Did it artificially.  That is true.  Don't just want to feel up the horse's thing.  How do you kind of know at night, you know?  Do they do DNA testing on them?  I don't know.  Probably.  Perhaps.  I just know that's the rule.  That's the rules.  Yeah.  I was reading that yesterday.  Wow.  Tom, what's some pertinent information?  I want you to be factually accurate.  I will.  Okay.  Did you read my email?  Not yet.  Oh, okay.  How are the braces?  Awkward.  Awkward.  Awkward still?  Yeah.  It's definitely awkward.  Yeah.  It's kind of weird when the boss has braces.  You have braces?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:50:00]  Closing in on the big 6-0 and got braces.  Are you in your late 50s?  Yeah.  That's a youngie.  I'll be 60 this year.  Wow.  This year?  Yep.  We've got to throw you a party, huh?  Oh, yeah.  If we're still around.  All right.  If we're still around.  Yikes.  Speculation thread.  Oh, whatever.  Did Al dump out of the boss saying what he said?  Oh, I'm sure he didn't.  How great would it be if we got an FCC complaint because of Tom?  What do you say, Al?  What do you say, Al?  What do you say, Al? 
[00:50:30]  So they got rid of Barbaro yesterday morning.  Yeah.  I can't believe it's on all the news.  It's a stupid dead horse.  Yeah.  It's just one of many that die racing.  I went to Belmont the first time.  I used to bet at OTB because I had a job next door to an OTB.  Knock and tin.  True mechanical.  Another air conditioning job.  Worked in the shop.  Every day.  Every day.  We would go to the place next door called Doubles.  There's a bar called Doubles.  Because you bought one drink.  They gave you two. 
[00:51:00]  Nice.  So we'd go to the bar for lunch.  Now, meanwhile, we're working in a shop, a sheet metal shop.  So we're handling what amounts to eight foot by four foot razor blades and machines that cross kink these things.  So it could take a finger off in a second.  Every machine in there could just shred you.  And we would go to the bar for lunch and just get tanked and bet on the horses.  We'd go to the OTB next door and spend all of our, like, $350 a week that we made betting on the horses and drinking at the bar. 
[00:51:30]  And owing the deli money because we couldn't afford to pay him that week.  It was just an awful, awful situation.  Well, all those places are owned by the same guy.  Yeah.  Same guy.  We're just giving them.  Open the doubles.  Deli doubles.  OTB.  We'll get all of this stupid Tin Knockers money.  Yeah.  And I bet on the horses and decided one day my brother says, let's go to Belmont.  Belmont's opening day.  Let's go down there.  So I go down, make a big bet. 
[00:52:00]  Because everyone told me the first time you go to the track and bet on a horse, you win.  It's just this beginner's luck thing.  And it really does happen a lot.  I've seen it happen.  Went down there, bet on a horse.  This horse is in the backstretch.  And I see, like, a puff of dust from the track.  And I'm looking for my number.  Nothing comes around.  He just died in the backstretch.  He actually died.  Actually just died.  Whether his heart exploded, his brain exploded, something just went. 
[00:52:30]  He died right in the back.  And I'm just standing there with my ticket.  And I was all excited.  Like, yeah, go, go, go.  You should win something for that.  You should win something.  There should be a window for a dead horse.  If your horse just dies.  Yeah.  One of his shoes to hang over your door.  Can you bet that?  There should be, like, you know.  Win, place, draw.  Win, place, or die.  Yeah.  Win, place, or die.  Yeah.  It was a memorable moment at the track.  But it happens all the time.  But they're making a big deal of this because, you know, everybody got all into it. 
[00:53:00]  But like Oath points out, you know, soldiers are dying on a daily basis.  They're not getting the airtime.  They don't get half the attention or sympathy.  Nope.  Nope.  Hey, we got to get into this.  I can't even say his last name because I don't care.  Daniel Negreanu?  Negreanu.  I almost had it.  Or Negranu.  I almost had it.  Negrano.  I've heard people pronounce it.  We had a run-in with this guy over, it's got to be close to two years.  Didn't we go out there like.  It was April of 95.  April of 2005. 
[00:53:30]  April 2005.  So we're closing in on two years ago.  And the guy's still talking about his confrontation he had with us when we did a broadcast from the  World Series of Poker, was it, in LA?  No, it was one of the World Poker Tour celebrity tournaments.  Yeah.  Anthony, a big poker player.  So we went out to LA and the deal was, you know, throw Anthony into the tournament.  And while he's playing cards, we would interview a bunch of celebrities that were also playing  as they were getting knocked out.  Now, one of the problems here, the celebrities are fine because it was a celebrity pro poker 
[00:54:00]  player tournament.  So one of the things, the celebrities are fine.  These guys sit down with the celebrities and had a great show, great time and everything.  The poker players now, these guys don't know anything about poker.  No.  I'm a poker fan.  So a couple of the people, I would have definitely liked to sit down and spend a little time chatting  about poker.  Poker kind of is taken off.  It kind of fits our demo.  I would have liked to have talked to Daniel Negreanu about some poker. 
[00:54:30]  Well, where's the problem?  I was playing a tournament.  Poker talk stinks.  It doesn't stink.  It stinks to you.  Where's the problem?  It stinks to you and Jimmy because you don't play the goddamn game.  It's huge right now.  Would you like to talk about the river for 20 minutes?  No.  Or would you like to hear me going after Ed Asner?  That's what I said.  The celebrity portion is fine.  I'm totally into that.  The Daniel Negreanu situation, I would have liked to have sat down with him and even five  minutes just talk a little poker with one of the superstars of the game, Daniel Negreanu. 
[00:55:00]  Here's how poker talk should go.  How'd you do?  I won.  Cool.  All right.  So it's a thing.  There's a whole vibe to it.  I know, but they're just fat dudes and their wives have black eyes and I'm so proud of  them.  It's just, it's a very, especially with people in our demo, they've taken to the game. 
[00:55:30]  What was very dangerous was you leaving the show to play poker because then there's no  filter whatsoever.  There was no good cop in the situation.  Trust me, Ed could be a bad cop as well, but in general, he kind of keeps things balanced  at times.  In this situation, I would have liked to have talked to him about some poker and then you  guys could have done what you do and I could have talked to him about poker and perhaps  he wouldn't have left thinking like he was dropped into a snake pit.  Yeah, sitting in was Joe Rogan.  Joe Rogan, which completely just let loose on the guy. 
[00:56:00]  Completely.  Saying how his ex was having sex with a black guy.  Yeah, because he had just broken up with his girlfriend and instead of being sympathetic,  Joe Rogan piled on and just gave this guy thoughts and images in his head that he obviously  didn't want with a freshly broken up relationship.  Right.  Joe Rogan, which he talks about yesterday on his blog.  Yesterday?  This is almost two years ago.  Well, because he had another angle on it, so he had a recap. 
[00:56:30]  Okay.  And the first three quarters of his blog is recapping what had happened two years ago  at the Commerce Casino in Los Angeles.  Were you on Last Comic Standing?  I did back in 2003 or whatever.  I did two episodes.  Okay.  Then he had to leave.  I had a contract.  No, I was going to do it at the time.  I wanted to get in the house because I figured that most of the guys are not funny.  on reality TV.  I'm like, where else can you be on television unscripted?  I wanted the idea of that.  How great would Last Comic Standing be in the house where a rape was involved? 
[00:57:00]  That would have really made the news.  And he's saying that Joe Rogan wasn't funny in the least.  Joe Rogan was hilarious that day at his expense.  Perhaps he didn't feel Joe Rogan was funny being the brunt of Joe Rogan.  Right, yeah.  So that's like somebody watching somebody at a firing squad.  Yeah.  And the guy that's being shot isn't going, wow, that guy's a great shot.  But the guy watching went, wow, he hit him right between the eyes. 
[00:57:30]  You know?  Of course he's not going to appreciate his humor.  Now I know who the guy is, but at the time I didn't know, didn't care, still don't care.  Kid poker!  Still don't care.  Guy's huge!  So, you know, we've got to make some good radio, and he somehow lets on that he just broke up  with his girlfriend, and that was the end we needed.  And Joe Rogan destroyed him.  And he could have walked away at any time, but he did not.  He was being cordial by sitting there.  Cordial as we're talking about how his ex is getting banged by a black guy? 
[00:58:00]  That's cordial?  He even said that he was stunned.  He didn't know what to do.  That's being a wimp that you're sitting there taking that.  But it was all, it was funny.  It was like nobody was really attacking the guy for real.  It was a goof.  Yeah.  Like, that's what we do to people.  That's what we do to each other.  I mean, I didn't.  I don't think he expected it.  Right.  I think he had done some radio, so I think he expected a typical kind of radio show.  And that wasn't what we did.  He said we came off, like, very unorganized and stuff, but that's the show. 
[00:58:30]  Can I read that?  Yes.  So this is part of his journal that was posted, I guess, yesterday or the day before.  I don't know.  Anyway, so I'm pulled in to be on the show, and it just comes off like a completely disorganized  mess.  Yeah.  That's our show.  We kind of take that as a compliment.  You should produce it.  That's our show.  Because that is our show.  We want it to be just where you don't know what you're going to hear next.  We want it to be very unexpected.  And some people fit that environment very well.  Other people, especially if they're not expecting it and aren't used to that, they don't take 
[00:59:00]  it very well.  It just seemed like utter chaos with no coordination whatsoever.  I'd done several radio shows before and had never quite seen anything like this set up.  Well, that's why we're more successful from all those other dumb shows you did there, Daniel.  We'll take that as a compliment.  You could put that on something.  You did a lot of safe radio where they asked you dumb poker questions, and most of the  listeners were like, who gives a crap?  They just let you run your mouth.  How do you talk to him about poker? 
[00:59:30]  Well, you've got to really try to make sure the cards you have are the cards, and that  they're not other cards.  Right.  And then when the cards come, and hopefully they all match up, and you get some good  hand.  Yeah.  And that's why we're successful.  Those other shows aren't syndicated all over the two countries.  The worst fun is that.  They all have...  When you get a card, how come your wife's with a black...  What?  Right.  That's what they want to hear.  And Joe Rogan brought up a very interesting thing.  You know, people break up with girls all the time, and then you want...  Do you wonder if they're banging someone?  You do wonder, but you don't want a guy two inches from your face yelling that a black 
[01:00:00]  guy is having sex with your freshly broken up girlfriend.  Yeah, no, I think you can defend that from it was funny, but not like, hey, it's a legitimate  question.  A fellow loses his girlfriend.  Is she with a black guy?  It was funny radio.  If you meet a poker player...  In our world, it seems normal.  I think that Barbara Walters would have asked that question.  Right.  I think that, you know...  It was funny radio.  Everyone enjoyed it, except for the victim of the whole thing, which was Daniel. 
[01:00:30]  How could you blame him for not enjoying that?  And then Daniel writes, they weren't prepared at all.  Didn't know who they were speaking to.  Knew nothing at all about poker.  And had no idea what to ask me.  I tried my best to make the best of an awkward situation.  The one guy who actually knew something about poker was busy playing in the tournament.  I was being just taken.  Taken bodily.  So then this Joe Rogan guy starts going a little batty.  Not funny in the least.  And I honestly believe I could be objective here because I don't mind poking fun at myself 
[01:01:00]  at all.  He basically just repeatedly cursed and acted like a juvenile.  His material was weak and he masked that by just cursing more.  I watch a lot of stand-up and you can tell when a guy has no material when he overuses  fart jokes and thinks that if he just curses louder and louder that it's somehow funny  and that no one will notice that he doesn't actually have any jokes.  But he doesn't mention how he was talking about the black guy possibly banging his fresh ex.  Well, would you add that in?  Well, if you're going to write about it, then don't write about it. 
[01:01:30]  Anyway, fast-forwarding a bit, he was saying nasty things...  Okay, here it is.  Nasty things about what became my wife.  They're back together?  Yes.  See, he got back together with the ex.  The guy didn't know me at all.  That's why he wrote this now.  She made him write it.  We weren't friends.  You let them say that about me two years ago.  You didn't say anything?  Mm-hmm.  What are you, a wimp?  Oh, jeez.  I thought Rogan was funny.  Now I've got to write this.  The guy didn't know me at all.  We weren't friends.  So it was all just crossing a line.  Well, at that point, he should have said something or just walked away. 
[01:02:00]  You just don't meet someone for the first time, invite them on your show, and then say the things he said.  Oh, boy, then you don't know this show.  And that's why we're successful there, Daniel.  He didn't know the show.  That's true.  I didn't have a real problem with anyone else on the show.  Jim Norton and I hardly spoke except for one joke he was trying to tell that I caught on to quickly.  He was basically speaking gibberish with a straight face and was expecting me to try and answer it intelligently.  Remember that old gag?  Of course, his question made no sense, so I was like, what are you babbling about? 
[01:02:30]  He acknowledged that he was trying to get me, but it didn't work out.  Yeah, yeah, he caught me, and so I acknowledged it.  It was like, for anyone that didn't remember, I would ask questions like, listen, I mean, you're a poker player.  Do you think that, like, a lot of times people will say that if you have more than one queen of a suit, it can be a problem because a lot of other people may not have a river card coming.  I mean, is that more accurate, would you say, or less from the time that when you started playing?  What?  Just like nonsense, and most people try to answer because I don't want to seem stupid.  Well, yeah, sometimes you get a hand that, like, they completely don't answer the question.  They answer something different. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah, queens are good questions.  Yeah.  He caught on, and so to reward him, I jam my tongue down his throat for a couple of minutes.  That's how two men celebrate.  Fast forward.  It all died down and went away until a recent broadcast where they were talking about poker, and my name came up.  I was then surprised to hear Jim Norton go off on me.  I guess he listens to the show.  I actually wasn't really offended, although several members of the forum seemed bothered by it.  The dude is a comedian, and his job is to try and be funny.  In fact, if he truly believed the things he was saying, I'd be surprised.  You have nothing personal against the man.  No, to be very honest, I had fun when he was on the show. 
[01:03:30]  What annoyed me about him so much was the way he went back and trashed the show.  It was like, because to me, like, why would he read it like that?  Like, I didn't take that.  Like, even Rogan being obnoxious, I didn't take anything real.  Like, there was no real feeling behind it.  There was no, like, this guy's a douche.  And then when he posted, like, yeah, it's a low-rent stern rip.  It's like, Jesus, why would you not just say that when you were there?  Some people that aren't completely prepared for this type of thing react like that.  They don't enjoy it, I guess.  That's fair, but I didn't realize it had affected him. 
[01:04:00]  I was actually very surprised that he didn't have a good time on the show.  Like, why would you get pissed off?  I was too, because I actually wanted to get a picture with him.  So I went up afterwards.  Then he comes running back, and we're like, ah, uh, uh.  I've got to explain what happened to his hero.  But he seemed kind of, okay.  He is one of many very colorful personalities in the poker world.  Is he?  Of course.  One of the biggest winners.  He's very funny at the table. 
[01:04:30]  If you ever watch a poker game that he's playing in, a final table or something, where there's  a lot of the poker superstars sitting at the same table, and you kind of know their personalities  and what they're all about.  He's very funny.  He does imitations of the guys.  He cracks some good jokes.  Really?  I think the guy's good.  Really?  I got an...  I...  Why can't I show appreciation for this man's talent at the poker table? 
[01:05:00]  But those are the kind of jokes that they...  It's like there's certain contexts where you're going to get a laugh because people respect  you, or because of the...  Like astronauts, when they're in space, anything they say is funny.  Like any astronaut in space, hey, big blue marble, wish I had a hot dog, and the control  room just dies.  Oh, you're right, you're that, Aquarius.  Exactly.  But do that at a club, and you get pissed right here for something.  Sorry. 
[01:05:30]  Buzz Aldrin gets a bottle to his face.  Yeah, exactly.  It doesn't matter.  And I love that.  You're on Earth now, funny man.  This is always interesting.  For example, he actually was cracking...  Back to Jim Norton.  He was actually cracking on my hairdo, which I found pretty ironic since it currently looks  exactly like his.  I guess Jimmy had his head shaved at the time a little more.  Yeah.  That's pretty ironic.  Well, did he change his hairstyle?  No.  Oh.  No.  It's just a little strange.  I was actually a fan of his work prior to him chewing me out, so... 
[01:06:00]  Oh, boy.  Should the fact that he was cracking on me change that?  One less Lucky Louie, D.V.  He writes, no, I don't think so.  Unless it became hateful, I have no problem with being made the butt of a joke.  Anyway, I have no beef with the show.  It doesn't seem like my kind of humor at all, but to each his own.  Having said that, I think this Joe Rogan guy has zero comedic talent whatsoever.  Man, you don't know how to read comedy there, sir.  Joe Rogan is hilarious.  I think Rogan hit him on a weird level.  Joe really slammed him.  I think Rogan really bothered him.  Yeah.  Rogan said something.  Maybe it was Rogan.  Rogan's like an alpha male.  He's the type that just walks in and rapes other men. 
[01:06:30]  He's just savage.  Joe's an ape.  He really is just a big, thick-handed ape who rapes men.  He's just an animal.  Goon.  And I think that that personality, that might have bothered the guy.  Joe reminded him of something he hated, man.  And the last line, if he can make it in showbiz, that is undeniable proof that anybody, in capital letters, has a chance.  Well, see, it ends on a positive note.  Uplifting ending, right, yeah.  He read that wrong.  I mean, Joe Rogan is a very, very funny, gorgeous human being.  But there's going to be those people that hate him. 
[01:07:00]  I wish I was at the, I wish I was there for the interview.  I think it would have been nice to sit and talk to the man, maybe two minutes about poker.  The best, Anthony, just walking back to the broadcast area going, all right, what happened?  What happened?  No, because we're all laughing like little kids and stuff.  Because I'm taking pictures with all the other poker heroes and poker superstars.  And then I'm like, I got to get one with Daniel.  And it's like, where did he go?  Oh, he left.  We were in a weird mood that day because everybody we interviewed, we really pissed off. 
[01:07:30]  You.  Can we get, what?  You.  No, Ed Asner was my fault.  Ed Asner.  Daniel was Joe Rogan's fault.  And I remember one or two other people that weren't happy with our questioning.  Do we have the Asner clip?  That was so uncomfortable.  All right, let's find the Ed Asner clip.  We'll play it after the break.  Yeah, he called me the destroyer.  Yeah, and then the actual Lou Grant used the F-bomb on you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're going to have to clean it up for this side of the show.  Absolutely.  But Jimmy, Jimmy was there for that. 
[01:08:00]  I wanted to die.  I was so happy that we got Ed Asner.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Grew up watching Mary Tyler Moore.  No picture for Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Jimmy got one.  I got one of him kissing my head.  Yeah.  He loved me just because I was kind of decent to him on the air.  I was a savior.  He loved me.  After your destruction, he kissed my head.  He did, didn't he?  Yes.  He looked me right in the eye.  I got to hear that because it's amazing to me that that old could get bothered by somebody.  You think, you know.  He's been through everything at that point in his life.  How could anything bother him?  Yeah.  Hope he did.  It's amazing.  Well, he was boring, and I just had to kind of point out that he was really boring on 
[01:08:30]  our show.  Right to his face, and he looked in my eyes.  Oh, did he want, he wanted me dead.  He was not happy with me.  He was not happy.  Observation.  Can we get that for after the break?  All right.  Also, yesterday we were doing deaf karaoke.  Yeah.  It was because of Karen Meyer.  We never got to the audio of Karen Meyer.  Never got to the story.  Reporting on Crip Slam Sundays.  Crip Slam Sundays.  Live performances by people with disabilities about their disabilities. 
[01:09:00]  And he's a disabled newscaster giving you that report.  Right.  That's where it all began, and then we did deaf karaoke with Bad 80s Songs, and then we  went with some Queen a little earlier, and Patrice O'Neill and Anthony did a fine Bohemian  Rhapsody bit.  Just kind of just goofing around, and then the production team just ran with it.  And made it into something.  And put music to it.  We'll get into that next.  If we go into lockdown mode. 
[01:09:30]  Lockdown!  We're going to go into lockdown mode?  We got to go to lockdown, or else we get sidetracked.  Explain to Louis C.K. what's lockdown.  Oh, my God.  Everyone knows what lockdown is.  We get distracted.  We're like infants in here.  We can't, we're goldfish.  We can't keep any train of thought for more than two seconds.  So lockdown means no one comes in the studio.  We don't comment on anything.  We don't change subjects.  We just focus on what we want to talk about when we get back from the break.  We don't talk to each other.  We just look at the...  Stop it.  We've just looked at a piece of paper with what we're supposed to talk about.  What we're supposed to talk about when we get back from break. 
[01:10:00]  Ready?  Lockdown.  Lockdown!  It's Anobian Anthony.  Lockdown!  What hacks?  It's Anobian Anthony.  Lockdown.  It's Anobian Anthony.  Lockdown.  It's Anobian Anthony.  Lockdown.  It's Anobian Anthony.  Lockdown.  You know, I saw this prison movie the other day.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Really, like, makes you not ever want to go to prison.  Ruins the whole...  It, like, it keeps you out of trouble. 
[01:10:30]  It's the thing that keeps you out of trouble.  Prison chicks?  No, it was like guy prison stuff.  It wasn't Caged Heat?  No, the female prison movies are pretty good.  Yeah.  They're the old ones.  Linda Blair was in Caged Heat, and it always portrayed the women's prison life.  Wait a minute.  What?  We're supposed to be in lockdown.  Damn it!  What happened?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:11:00]  Lockdown.  Oh, see, I forgot about lockdown.  Oh, Death, Bohemian Rhapsody.  See how that happens?  I completely forgot.  That was supposed to happen during the break?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, that wasn't at all.  We weren't supposed to talk.  No, not at all.  No, we talked a lot during the break there.  We got some new tire audio, too.  That's just terrific.  Oh, good.  What a dummy.  We'll get to that in a little bit.  And E-Rock's getting the Ed Asner clip together for us.  Cleaning it up so we make sure.  Gotta keep it clean. 
[01:11:30]  What do you say, Al?  Gotta keep it clean for Al.  Some of the listeners don't like the Al bit.  Yeah.  What's that to like?  Go screw.  It's just a silly thing.  They just try to pick it apart.  Douches.  They listen and listen and listen and listen and go, yeah, that's it.  I don't like that.  There's the too cool for the room poster guys that are just, yeah, you know, I'm kind of  a fan, but you mean the thing where you play that what you just played?  Yeah. 
[01:12:00]  Somebody critiques that?  Yeah.  A little bit.  Yes.  What do you say, Al?  Somebody went like, did you dump out of that one, Al?  Okay.  And continue the show, Pookie.  Yeah.  It's a great bit because we're on regular radio.  It sucks at times.  And you got Al down the hall.  He's got to keep it fair.  And it's at night talking about Al serving.  What do you say, Al?  Caddyshack.  Clip.  How did you not like Caddyshack?  You guys had...  And Al's got to make decisions from this little room down the hall.  Yeah.  And there's some douche out there that doesn't like it.  So we always talk about Al. 
[01:12:30]  Enough with the Al.  Okay.  Which, by the way, makes us do it more.  Yeah.  So...  Exactly.  So it's backfiring on you, pal.  Bohemian Rhapsody.  So yesterday, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  We did Def Karaoke.  Yeah.  And just a brilliant Bohemian Rhapsody done by Anthony and Patrice.  But then put to music.  After the...  Can we afterwards get to the Karen Meyer?  Yeah, yeah.  That's where this all began.  We were supposed to play this audio about this time yesterday, matter of fact. 
[01:13:00]  And then the next hour was taken up with Def Karaoke.  Yep.  And this was probably the highlight.  And now this is brand new because they took the raw audio from these guys and put it to  music and made it into a little thing you can buy.  Because we didn't really do it in order.  No.  Either.  We were just blurting out parts of the song as they came to our memory.  And then who put it together?  Steve and Dirk.  Steve and Dirk went into the studio, grabbed the music, and kind of picked and choose the 
[01:13:30]  little parts that we did and threw it together.  So I think I give them a little credit.  There it is.  Nice job.  The National Association of the Deaf and the Opie and Anthony Show are proud to bring you  a heartwarming presentation.  A heartwarming presentation.  Mama, don't do it to me.  Stone Cold Death, a hearing-impaired tribute to the music of Queen.  Listen and cringe as a room full of genetic defectives attempts to sing a classic Queen melody and fails miserably. 
[01:14:00]  God just doesn't want some people to sing.  God doesn't want some people to sing.  Shut up, cauliflower ears. 
[01:14:30]  Hey, candy dish ears, stop interrupting.  And let the other guys sing. 
[01:15:00]  You're going to wish your ears were busted, too, after hearing this.  That's why each CD comes with a free ice pick.  No, baby. 
[01:15:30]  No, baby.  Somebody's in the house.  There's everything right out of here.  I got to go.  Thank you, God.

[01:16:30]  Yeah, it was a little distraction as we were playing that.  What's going on near the window?  I couldn't run over there.  Naked girl.  Naked girl.  Ready for work.  Yeah, she's getting ready for work.  She was naked.  Same one?  Yeah, and then we pointed her out.  Well, I want Louie to get a little look at her.  And then the second we pointed her out, she went into the bathroom, and now she hasn't come out. 
[01:17:00]  She hasn't shut the bathroom door, though, because I kind of see the toilet.  She'll be out.  You see a newspaper turning?  Oh, she's going to be a while.  All I know is the doors swung open and the binoculars were being handed out to everybody.  Oh, I know.  That's what I love about this show.  Like, screw the radio show, naked girl.  Everyone had binoculars or all, like, peering.  The woman who never met her.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, wait a minute.  I think I saw some movement.  I think I saw some movement.  I saw something, too, I thought.  All right, well, get your binoculars there, Louie. 
[01:17:30]  You know what you didn't see was shaving.  All right, movement.  Got movement.  There she is.  Oh, there she is.  Yep.  And all the binoculars go up.  She went to the closet.  She's going to pick her clothes out now and put them on the bed and step back a little from the closet.  Has she lost some weight finally?  No.  She's on the bike every morning.  Go on the bike.  There she goes.  She's putting on...  Stupid Louie's in the wrong window.  You see her at...  How could you miss her?  She's right there.  What's wrong with you, Louie?  I know.  He can't figure out the binoculars. 
[01:18:00]  There's an old woman watering a plant in the other apartment he's staring at.  She doesn't shave at all.  It looks like an azalea.  That is stupid.  Left.  Left.  Louie.  Wait, you can't figure out how to like...  He sees it with his own eyes, but he can't match it up with the binoculars.  She's in that closet to the left.  I can't even use the binoculars because my hands are shaking a little bit.  You don't realize how much you shake until you're looking through binoculars. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  Isn't that amazing?  Let's go to Jared in Boston.  Jared, what's up?  Focus, focus.  Deaf reporter audio.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but naked girl in the window kind of...  Naked girl in the window, right, trumps everything.  Yeah, it kind of does.  That's the showstopper.  What, Louie?  Get out of the closet, you naked porn.  I thought you were yelling at her.  Yeah, you really do start yelling things at her.  Like, what are you doing?  You're not showing yourself naked in the window.  Throwing pebbles at her window. 
[01:19:00]  Come on.  I thought you were yelling at Steve.  She's a tease.  Yeah, Steve, put your clothes on.  Get out of the closet.  I hate her.  I hate her.  Speaking of Deaf reporter, binoculars, we could actually use her ears and just peer through them.  It would still be better than what she uses them for.  Let's go to Al in Jersey.  Al.  Hey, what do you want, Al?  What do you say, Al?  What's up, Al?  What up, Owen?  Hey, Al.  Listen, man, that for a kid...  Oh, excuse me. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, no, don't.  What do you say, Al?  Al has no choice on that one.  What's up, Al?  Let's start over again.  Hi, Al.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  That Bohemian Rhapsody, that is awesome.  You guys got to sell that.  You got to sell it.  We'll just throw it up on the website.  No rights or anything.  Yeah.  We won't buy the rights.  We'll just sell it.  Yeah, people will buy it.  They won't go and get it for free.  They'll actually line up to buy it because they couldn't get it off the website.  What's the matter with you?  It's available at All Tower Records.  You made one just that promo for that thing. 
[01:20:00]  That's a terrible marketing idea.  $45 a disc wrapped up.  Make it.  It would sell.  It would sell.  All right, Al.  Thank you.  Let's go to Larry on Long Island.  Larry, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Larry.  What's up, Larry?  I just wanted to tell you, it's kind of completely different than naked girls.  It's a naked guy, which is kind of gay, and I'm not, just so you know.  But I used to work in Manhattan like five, six years ago, and there was a bathroom, and 
[01:20:30]  across there was another building, and we were probably about 30, 40 stories up, and  across to the other building, a couple stories down, there was this guy that used to sit  in my grandfather chair, completely buck naked every day, all day, no matter what,  just start stroking himself, facing up all the time.  I don't think they're going to let that through, either.  Why would you, hey, I can almost understand looking once, because you don't know what  you're saying.  Why would you look every day?  No, no, I didn't look every day, but I just knew he was there every day.  How did you know he was there?  How did you know he was there every day? 
[01:21:00]  How did you know?  You're very gay, man.  How did you know?  I have people living in my building, like, they're two floors down, actually, and I told  you one time I was watching sex.  I was watching, like, a guy from the waist down, and his hips were moving, moving.  But it's weird when you see that.  I saw a couple of, like, you couldn't really tell what it was, but he was having sex with  somebody.  Yeah.  And then the next day, I see two gentlemen at the sink in the kitchen.  Oh!  Oh!  And I'm like, wow, do I wish I didn't do what I did watching that yesterday? 
[01:21:30]  How did that story get hotter?  I know.  Wow.  My wife and I were staying at the Lowe's Hotel in L.A., and it's got a courtyard, so you  look across at the other room.  Yeah.  And we're looking across, and we had just been in a big fight, and we're looking, and there's  a prom couple, high school kids in a tux and a gown, just entering a room and looking  around and checking out the minibar and stuff.  Uh-oh.  And I'm just looking at them and going, oh, look, young prom couple, and in seconds, they're  just banging, like, really, really fast, and he's like his, like, really weird, animal-y 
[01:22:00]  monkey sex, like, on display, fully lit, and my wife and I are just watching that and just  depressed.  It's like we're way at the other end of the spectrum.  We're like, that'll never happen to us again.  Why didn't you just throw her down?  Like, I couldn't even get excited.  I'm just like, uh, what?  You should have thrown her down.  Oh, she might have liked the surprise of me.  Yeah, no, now I should have, and then just walked out the door and never seen her again.  That would have been the best ending to that story. 
[01:22:30]  So I looked at my wife, I threw her on the bed, had sex with her, walked out the door,  and I don't know what happened.  Haven't seen her since.  Lucky Louie on DVD, starting today, by the way.  That's right.  Yep.  And Louie C.K.'s in New York, you know, doing some stuff, and you're not staying in the apartment.  No, I'm staying in a hotel.  Your wife is back in L.A. with kids, and you're, what are you doing?  Well, my apartment that we, that she bought with my money is too cold, and it's like worse  than any place I had lived in when I was in my 20s struggling. 
[01:23:00]  And so every time I get annoyed at my apartment, I just go checking it.  I mean, it's Manhattan.  Yeah.  I stayed in the Waldorf Astoria one night.  Great hotels.  Very expensive, though.  How much is in the Waldorf for a night?  Oh, my God.  Uh, $3.79, that was.  And that's got to be, like, a cut-rate room.  Oh, yeah.  That's the lobby.  You sleep under the sofa in the lobby.  Is there any guilt associated with this?  No.  Knowing the wife's back in L.A. with the kids?  No, because she's making me stay in this stupid place.  It's just stupid.  And I'm sure you don't talk it over with her.  You're just like, you know what? 
[01:23:30]  I'm out of here.  She says, where are you right now?  I'm like at the wall.  Sometimes I don't tell her.  Sometimes she calls me at a nice hotel.  Yeah.  We talk.  She has no idea where I am.  There's no reason to tell her where I am.  It's like, oh, no, I'm at the apartment.  Yeah.  Room service.  Yeah.  Amazing room service.  $300 breakfast bill.  Yeah, help you.  No, I checked into the Parker Meridian today because it's close to here.  And last night I checked in there.  And I got a king room, no smoking.  So I go in there. 
[01:24:00]  It's two small beds, and it's a smoking room.  Oh, boy.  So I call down, and I go, you gave me the wrong kind of room.  And they go, we can't move you, sir.  It's totally full hotel.  And I go, yeah, but I asked for king non-smoking.  Yeah, that's a request.  It's really too late, sir.  We can't do anything about it.  And I go, well, that's ridiculous, and it's unacceptable.  Okay, sir, we'll move you to a king non-smoking.  But I thought, isn't that amazing?  They're all such lying scumbags.  Yeah, you've got to turn into an a-hole so they do the right thing.  And how does the same room for one night go for, like, twice the price the next night? 
[01:24:30]  Like, what happened in the room that made it twice the value of the – it's still available.  It's not a sold-out night or something like that, but for some reason, different nights.  Oh, man, they take advantage of the tours around Christmas in New York.  It's unbelievable.  After 9-11, all these businesses were just crying, please, someone check in.  Remember they were begging people to come to New York and visit?  Yeah, please visit.  Giving you cut rates on rooms and stuff. 
[01:25:00]  Them and the goddamn airlines are another bunch of frigging crooks.  They're liars.  They're liars.  People are traveling now more than ever in history right now.  More people are traveling by air than in all of history.  And fuel prices at a low of – it's like $52 a barrel it's down to at this point.  And they're still charging more than it was when it was like $70 a barrel.  They're still crying poverty.  Well, that's always fake. 
[01:25:30]  It's not like they look at the fuel bill.  It's not like they're charging us exactly how much it costs.  It's like, well, let me fuel this 67 up and see what everyone's best to have.  It'll be 250 feet.  I flew to Sacramento, and I know the audience doesn't want to hear this,  but I was actually in coach for part of the flight.  Stop it.  I know, I know.  For part of the flight?  Yeah, well, I upgrade.  I'm a Platinum member, so I upgrade sometimes.  During the flight, you upgraded?  Yes, they actually stopped the plane on a cloud.  LOL, give me those ribs, you.  No, we had to connect through Houston.  And so I upgrade on the second half of the flight, the crappy half. 
[01:26:00]  And I sat in coach.  It's mind-boggling.  I'm 5'6", 156 pounds, and I'm uncomfortable.  It's like, how does anybody with a man's stature sit?  It's like they can't treat you like a human being.  They've put more seats in there.  Yeah, they squeeze more seats in.  I flew back from L.A. once, and it was a 10 p.m. flight, and I'm in a bad mood.  And it was full, and I had the one empty seat next to me, thank God.  I'm on the aisle, and they're the middle seat between me and this guy. 
[01:26:30]  And this woman, this family gets on, a man and a woman, and they each have a kid in their arm.  The woman scans the place and sees the seat next to me.  It's not her seat.  Oh, no, no.  She comes, marches over, and says, you sit in the middle.  I'm taking your aisle seat.  And I'm like, no, this is my assigned seat.  Well, that's an open seat, and you sit in it, because I have a child.  Ew.  And I go, well, I travel with my kids all the time.  I had never made anybody move.  You can't just make someone move because you have a kid. 
[01:27:00]  And she goes, fine, then I'm going to sit in the middle seat next to you, and you're going to have to deal with me and my kid getting up through the whole flight like that.  And so I said, I'm getting off this plane.  I'm just getting off the plane.  It's just one of those things.  I don't care the ramifications.  I'm just getting off the plane.  You just left the flight.  I just picked up my bag, and I started leaving.  And as I'm going through first class, the woman goes, well, we're going to close the doors.  And I go, that woman's crazy.  I'm not sitting next to that person.  I'm just going to stay in L.A.  I don't even know what my plane is.  Oh, God.  I love L.C.K.  And she goes, just sit there, and points at her first class seat. 
[01:27:30]  Just sit down.  Nice.  Upgrade.  She needed a fix.  I love it.  You know what you were doing also.  And then she served me the whole flight.  Oh, good.  Oh, I'll have to fish.  And I like made it.  Oh, it was great.  You should have just looked back.  How was your kid?  You know what you were doing, though, when you were leaving?  If you did get off that plane, you would have wished it crashed.  You just were sitting there going, I hope it crashes.  Oh, I hope I get to tell that story.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  And you know what happened?  I got off the plane because of that woman.  Yep.  And it went down.  No survivors.  Hey, we're going to back up.  We're going to back up a couple minutes here.  Dan in Pittsburgh.  What's up, Dan?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  Good morning, Dan.  I worked on a job site that was right across the street from a high-rise dormitory.  I know exactly what you're talking about with the naked women because it would almost shut  the job down.  Because you could see every day, college girls, different floors, whatever, every day you'd  see a naked lady.  Yep.  Yeah, that's right. 
[01:28:30]  A job site naked lady.  Yes, yes.  One of the best naked ladies.  She's back now, but she's got clothes on.  She's got clothes on.  Her value as a human has plummeted to nothingness.  Plummeted to nothingness.  Yes.  People want to even look.  There was a job I was doing.  It was a locker room.  It was the guy's locker room.  Had to do an air conditioning job.  So it was tile ceilings that I had to pop out.  And then I realized the wall that goes to the women's locker room only goes up to the 
[01:29:00]  tiled ceiling.  Porky's.  It didn't go all the way up like a firewall to the actual ceiling.  So I was able to climb over onto the wall, make it look like I'm working.  Yeah.  And took a piece of metal where I could then poke.  You know, it's made out of like a cork kind of thing.  I cut it with my tin snips into a sharp point and poked the ceiling tile and then lifted  it up.  And I was able to just get a perfect view of the women's locker room and nothing got done 
[01:29:30]  for days because then you're like work partners, the electricians, everyone else is on to you  and they're all taking turns.  You know, let me look.  And it's like, don't blow it because the guy that blows it is the guy you got to beat up.  Yeah.  Because he ruined everything.  And you're like, did you see that one?  And you get like, did you give the girls names?  You know?  Did you see Harry?  Did you see her?  But that was like a big part of the job, trying to find and see naked women.  Yeah, sure.  Let's go to Taylor in Virginia. 
[01:30:00]  Taylor.  Taylor.  Zero attention span.  Play the Karen Meyer audience.  Oh, damn.  Lockdown.  All right.  We'll do that next.  Do you want to know what a shallow, before we go, what a shallow ass I am when I'm flying  home sometimes, I'm actually hoping that the next continental flight from that destination  to Newark crashes and like my girlfriend or somebody, not that I want people dead, but  like my girlfriend hears that the Sacramento flight has crashed and she's worried about me  and she's panicked, but I'm on a flight that's okay.  And then she's just so grateful to see me and have me alive. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, yeah.  All those people have to die so that you get a little bit of nice, hey, she likes me.  Like, is that awful?  Just so you know for sure that she loves you.  No, I used to have, like when I was a kid, I used to fantasize all the time that my parents  would die so that I could go to school and everybody would pay attention to me.  Oh, wow.  And that I could hold that press conference that kids hold when something happens.  Oh.  And that my teacher would take me aside, if you need anything.  What attention whores.  That's what I wanted.  That's why you guys are in comedy.  I always had the I had to land the plane scenario. 
[01:31:00]  Oh, really?  That was when I was a kid, always.  Like, something would happen and only I could, like, solve the situation.  That 11-year-old kid back there.  Yeah.  Have a feeling he's the one.  Not only that, there were, like, things where I had to, like, somebody had some medical problem  and I had to actually, like, operate on them on a bus or a plane or something.  Why would they go to you?  You little boy.  Because it was, no, it was, like, immediately something had happened and they needed immediate 
[01:31:30]  attention.  And I was the only one with the knowledge to do open heart surgery on a plane with a pen  and, you know, a bottle cap.  You know, before we took off yesterday, they get on the loudspeaker, but we're still parked  at the gate and they go, is there anybody on the flight that has medical expertise or  a doctor in case of an emergency?  In case?  There was a woman on the plane who was having something wrong with her and they thought  she might have an emergency, so they just went to make sure there was a doctor on the  plane.  Just in case.  How about get her off the plane now?  Yeah.  How about drag her off by her?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  All right.  Listen, we're late and we got to get the Karen Meyer thing in. 
[01:32:00]  Oh.  So we'll step aside again and we'll attempt to do it when we get back.  We'll try this again.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right back at it.  It is the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got Jimmy on the line.  Hey.  He, uh, he's calling us Peeping Tom. 
[01:32:30]  Shut up.  Oh, Jimmy.  Uh, Jimmy, what's up?  Yeah, guys, uh, when I was in the union, a few guys got locked up.  Once you use binoculars, you're, uh, considered to be the top.  Yeah, but we're not looking.  We're actually bird watching and there was birds flying.  Exactly.  That's right.  There was a bird that landed on the rail.  And everyone is a Peeping Tom, by the way.  Yeah.  If it's there, you're going to look.  Yes, sir.  Bird watching.  The birds had left the nest and we were staring at it.  All right. 
[01:33:00]  We can do a few things here.  We, uh, we finally got the Ed Asner cleaned up for this side of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Should play it for Louis C.K.  Yeah.  Because we started that storyline.  And we got the Karen Meyer thing.  Karen Meyer.  Karen Meyer.  As long as we handle it nicely.  Huh?  As long as we handle it nicely.  I don't want to poke fun at people who are hearing impaired.  Don't.  No.  Well, the Ed Asner thing is, uh...  Good egg.  It's quick.  So why don't we do it?  All right.  We started the story earlier.  It was, uh...  That fast.  We were at a poker tournament.  We're never getting to the deaf woman audio.  We might surprise some people. 
[01:33:30]  We were at this poker tournament in L.A.  Anthony's playing poker.  And it was up to me to just, uh, run the ship without him.  And, uh, all hell was breaking loose around me.  And, uh, well, Ed Asner was on our show.  Because we were getting top-notch guests that day.  Top-notch.  Top-notch.  And he was really, really boring.  So it was time to try to get him off the show.  In a very, very professional way.  So let's go to the audio.  You trying to get rid of me?  Yes.  What are you doing, Ben?  Oh.  Ben, what's that?  Sign language. 
[01:34:00]  What's the sign language?  Uh, Ed.  That's Ben.  He's our producer.  And he decides when, uh, a guest is, uh, getting a little too boring.  And that was the sign.  What the f***?  He gives, Ed.  More disrespect.  We're having a good interview.  I can tell you, Anthony, that that's the last time I'll ever be on your show.  I wasn't there.  No, that was, that, yeah, Ben.  I've suffered your insults enough.  I certainly wouldn't come back again.  I'll be glad to talk to you about the Columbia documentary some other time when he's not around. 
[01:34:30]  Can I talk to you, Ed?  I'm a good fan.  I love you.  Absolutely.  Thank you.  Be sure that he's not in there.  I don't, he does this all the time.  I'm a good fan.  We're very happy to have you on the show.  He is, uh, he is, uh, uh, he's a destroyer.  He's a destroyer.  He's like Gordon Gekko.  He built nothing.  He liquidates.  He's filthy.  He's greasy.  Yes, he is.  I don't want to smell his shorts.  He's a Svengali.  In quotes, I don't want to smell his shorts.  Ed Asner.  Bravo.  The great Ed Asner.  The great Ed Asner.  Thank you, sir.  Very nice to meet you. 
[01:35:00]  Thank you very much.  You're a destroyer.  He called you a destroyer.  Wait till Anthony hears this on the replay.  Oh, it was phenomenal.  Hey, Jimmy, get back here, man.  I started sweating.  Ed, no, come on.  Give me a handshake, please.  Oh, that's phenomenal.  Well, yeah, because then I'm like, all right, come on.  Just shake my hand.  As he's walking away, he goes, go F yourself. 
[01:35:30]  He cursed you out.  Basically what he said.  Go F yourself.  Yeah, that's what was happening when I was playing poker.  It was just a mess.  There was no good cop to be found over at that interview table.  Not that day.  Well, you know, he pointed out, when you point out the guy giving a signal, that's unprofessional  too, I have to say.  Right.  There's a guy giving a rap signal.  You don't go to him, hey, why is that guy doing that?  This is all an illusion.  Don't be a jerk.  Don't point it out.  No, it's like comedians on stage when there's a, you know, when you need a comedian, if you're 
[01:36:00]  hosting a show, you need a comedian to get off stage, you give him a little signal.  It's just part, and then the guy sometimes will look over, oh, you want me to get off  stage?  I'm off.  Am I running too late for you?  Yeah, I'm trying to get the crowd to go.  No, I'll let him stay.  All right, I'll stay.  Sorry if the crowd was enjoying me and I was decided to, oh, get off.  Get off.  Patrice.  All right, Karen Meyer.  She's a reporter out of Chicago.  She's deaf and she does disability stories.  It's just terrific on so many levels. 
[01:36:30]  They have to run subtitles, too.  That's not exploitive.  Yeah, if we make fun of it, it's awful.  It's amazing.  So she doesn't report others, she just reports disability stories?  Right, just handicapped stories.  I know, how, like...  How great is this?  This is the modern day freak show.  Yeah, no, I think...  But they make believe it's...  If they're going to do that, then the dark side has a right to take a whack at it.  Well, I think she should do it, but I think that she should be forced to wear, like,  a raggedy Andy wig and just kind of make goofy duh noises. 
[01:37:00]  Duh.  Duh.  Duh.  How can you not make fun of this?  I don't get it.  That's so cynical.  Let's get a deaf woman, but have her always talk about...  Disabilities.  Retarded people.  Yeah.  That's it.  Well, she started...  Retarded people.  She started a series called Crip Slam Sundays.  We don't know what that is yet.  They're live performances by people with disabilities, and they use their disabilities or talk about  their disabilities.  Still have no idea what it is. 
[01:37:30]  All right, well, let's listen to the audio.  Here's Karen Meyer out of Chicago.  The theater marks the return of Crip Slam Sundays.  This is an innovative series of live performances by and about people with disabilities.  Karen Meyer joins us with more.  Karen, here.  Hello, there.  Selfie up.  What?  What?  Oh, my God.  What?  What?  I mean, come on.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they run subtitles underneath, because how are you understanding that?  They do?  Yes.  You can't understand that.  Yes.  So why not just run the subtitles? 
[01:38:00]  It's the news, and she's on...  Why is she on it?  No, that's just...  They're exploiting her.  She should only be on the news.  They should pan to, like, a body in the street with a sheet over it and a stop sign that she  didn't see that she just walks through.  Or a don't-walk-signal, like, be jolly.  And you can still see, Jim.  No, but you couldn't hear the horn beeping.  Oh, right.  Okay.  The car barreled out of shore.  Meh.  Meh.  Useless.  And about people with disabilities, Karen Meyer joins us with more.  Karen, here.  I can't get past that. 
[01:38:30]  Did you call her stuffy?  Oh, my God.  I mean...  Oh, my God.  What?  Here's the thing, is that when somebody talks like that in any other context, like, whatever,  they're in a line and trying to get their Starbucks, it's not funny.  No.  Okay?  It's just the person doing their best to communicate with a handicap.  But when you say, here's a reporter, Karen Meyer, and now to Karen Meyer, what?  She's a news...  What? 
[01:39:00]  Like, there's some...  That's funny.  I would love to be an astronaut.  I probably couldn't.  Yep.  I don't fit the criteria.  I love that you said probably.  There's still a little party thinking, you know what?  I just want to be an astronaut.  You know what?  That's all I ever wanted to do.  Little boyish Anthony.  I want to be a fighter pilot.  Yeah.  But also, you don't have a fundamental disability that precludes you from that.  Yeah, I probably do.  Yeah.  I'm retarded. 
[01:39:30]  Don't ask.  Don't tell.  Don't ask.  Don't tell.  No, but it's like, I want to see her and her husband in bed at night with him with a megaphone  by her ear, whispering sweet nothing.  All right.  Come on.  Let's get back in.  She's deaf.  Tee-hee.  Tee-hee.  Her ears don't work at all.  Oh, they're awful.  They should have police tape across them.  There's a crime committed by nature in here. 
[01:40:00]  Karen Meyer joins us for tomorrow.  Karen.  Karen Meyer.  And then, selfie up.  Golo performances by renowned Chicago actress, Techie Lominski.  Kicked off the season.  All right.  All right.  Anybody?  Techie Lominski?  Why don't deaf people always lisp?  What?  Why don't they know that they're all gay?  Because they're all gay.  They are.  It's just a weird coincidence, Scott.  Two strikes by God.  Deaf gay jerk.  I'll bet when they hired her when she said she was deaf, they thought she was like DEF. 
[01:40:30]  They're like, all right, well, she'll help the blacks.  Wow.  And they're like, well, we can't fire her now.  She, like, can't.  It's not the type of job.  It's great.  A lot of people probably want to be newscasters.  You know what?  If she pulled it together and you could understand her, even then it would be like, all right.  All right.  She pulled it together.  She's a really good reporter.  She seems to really dig in and get her best.  She's got the instincts.  Yeah.  But she, I mean, there's no.  They're distracted.  They're doing it for shock value.  Period.  Selfie Ops, the solo performances by renown Chicago actress, Techie Lomixie, kicked off the 2007 series of Crip Slam Sunday with a hilarious tour in a hot spring commute in Northern California. 
[01:41:00]  That is clothing optional.  When I first sat here, all that was going through my head is.  All I heard was clothing optional.  Yeah, you know, also.  I guess what you're about to hear is a woman that's three foot five and she has no problem getting naked, possibly on the stage, and then making fun of her body. 
[01:41:30]  I guess.  Something.  All I know is the newscast is hearing optional.  You know, the other thing is, too, like, if it's supposed to be uplifting or, you know, break a barrier.  Right.  Deaf people can't hear her either.  Yeah, they're not being inspired.  No, they can't hear it.  I wish I could be inspired by this, but I can't hear a thing.  If every deaf person got their hearing and listened to her, they'd go, please get her off.  She's embarrassing us.  This is terrible.  So the hearing, only people with hearing have to suffer that, and no one benefits except for the news, the guy who runs that station who thinks it's funny is like we do. 
[01:42:00]  Has a gag.  Yeah, it's his gag reporter.  Well, the deaf people, because they lip read a lot of them, and they're probably watching going, who is this lispy, mush mouthed idiot?  What is she?  There are deaf people that, you know, can speak.  Yeah.  She's not one of them.  Out of all, if you're going to have a deaf reporter, they probably audition people, and they're like, she doesn't sound deaf enough.  Not deaf enough.  Like somebody came in with a really good one.  Yeah, but kind of like sounded too not deaf. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  They should have like the people with the Hubble telescope in their ears, hearing aids, you know?  Like big hearing aids, and then you could pull it off with the talking.  You obviously know they're deaf because of the hearing aids, but they can communicate.  Right.  This woman, does she have hearing aids?  She sounds awful.  That's what always amazed me, too, is deaf people with like thousands of dollars worth of hearing aid equipment, and they still can't hear.  It's like, why are you walking around with that?  You just want to walk up and bang cymbals next to their ears? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  That's to get hot earring, miss.  Why don't you not react?  All right.  Let's get back to this.  So this performer, she's three foot five, and she's naked.  I believe.  Ew.  All that was going through my head is, these people are normal.  I would say here.  If her parents knew, you know what would have been going through her head?  A hanger.  Three foot five is an adult, just buried alive.  That is clothing alcohol. 
[01:43:30]  Poor little feller.  When I first got here, all that was going through my head is, these people are normal.  A little sad here, a little clammy there.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Aw.  Different.  The three foot five inches tall actress is sharing her personal feelings about her body image.  How I was able to take off my clothes and feel good about myself. 
[01:44:00]  Some kid stole the clothes for her Barbie.  And I thought that it was going to be really weird because I'm different.  I have a disability, so my body is different from other people's bodies.  And then I realized once I took my clothes off, that put us all on equal ground.  And the whole thing is really about three, our souls, our bodies, and our bodies.  It's not the ground being equal.  That's the problem.  It's the tops of your head with other people's knees.  Do you know what would be great is in the middle of that interview, if some foreign maintenance 
[01:44:30]  man just walked in and just picked her up and opened a trash can and put her in and walked  out while she was talking without any anger or rancor, just because it's where she belongs.  It's just very matter of fact, just needs to be done.  Whistling, he ignores the camera and the lights and the person holding the microphone and just  drops her in the garbage and walks out.  That put us all on equal ground. 
[01:45:00]  And the whole thing is really about our souls and what's inside and not our bodies at all.  Yeah.  Except for your body is the part people have to look at.  Exactly.  That's the freak show.  So if you're getting up on stage and you take your clothes off, you've got to be either  a hot chick for people to be interested, hot chick at a strip club or something, or a  freak that you want to see naked.  Yeah, exactly.  I would go to see this just to see a freak, a three-foot-five-inch girl naked, see what  that looks like naked, see if everything's proportioned, see if it just looks like this 
[01:45:30]  giant, like...  We did try that day.  Yeah, we tried to get a midget naked one day and she ended up crying and it was really  just bad.  No, wait a minute, it's not awful.  She called us and said she wanted to become a stripper.  No, no.  She never stripped before.  She was a midget about four-foot-tall tops.  And we're like, well, why don't you come in, you know, try it out on us and maybe we'll  give you some pointers.  We've been to some strip clubs in our day. 
[01:46:00]  Oh, totally.  And so she gets on the, like, console, we start up the music that she picked out and  she starts stripping and next thing you know, she just starts bawling.  We're like, could you take...  That's her fault.  Because we're asking her to take more off.  She took, like, her top off and she's in her bra and panties on this console and it  just looked like...  That's when it started to suck for her, just that one...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because then we started noticing, like, you know...  And we weren't mocking her.  We were just fascinated.  Midgets, bodies, just things are poking out all over the place. 
[01:46:30]  They've got those bow legs and stuff and she's just standing there with those little Popeye  arms and we're telling her, all right, now lose the bra, lose the bra.  And she's, like, slowly...  And then we just see tears coming out of her eyes and...  Oh, I get it.  The strap.  You know what?  Yeah.  I did a show in Buffalo with Nick DiPaolo once.  We were working in some club and people are filing out past us after the show and there's  this midget.  This woman waddles by and she says to Nick, you were great. 
[01:47:00]  And then she looks at me and she goes, you were pretty good.  Not that funny.  Oh.  And I thought...  I realized...  See, she's a midget and she got loads and loads overload of therapy in her life.  Yeah.  And they go, you should just go out there and be...  You're like anybody.  Say whatever you want.  Be confident.  Yeah.  Have all the confidence of everybody.  I wanted to tell her, everybody who loves you is wrong.  You should be ashamed of your ugly little body.  They're faking it.  You should be too indebited to talk to people, you small idiots. 
[01:47:30]  You should have.  I just saw the video.  It's up on opianthony.com there, E-Rock.  Oh, yeah?  Under Nicole Starr, the Nicky Pidget.  E-Rock.  Why is it not up on that monitor?  We got her topless, actually.  I don't remember it that way.  I thought she, I guess when she finally realized what she did, she started bawling.  This is her right here.  Was it any surprise that that girl only liked half the show, Lou?  Of course she did.  By the way, something interesting in the background, that's Colin Hanks and Jack Black. 
[01:48:00]  They were in studio that day.  Right.  And they are staring at a topless midget right now.  Impressive enough.  Look, there's Jack Black.  It's all right from what I can see.  I can't, I don't have a point of reference.  You need to have like a normal size person.  Yeah.  You got to have like a dime next door.  She was regular, then a toy poodle walks by and it's the same height.  Let's go to Ryan.  Like a Great Dane.  We got one of these today.  Ryan and Buffalo.  What's up, Ryan?  Great Dane carries it off in his mouth.  You can't do this.  This is just, this is just awful.  What?  It's unethical. 
[01:48:30]  It's immoral.  You can't do it.  You don't mean that.  Uh-huh.  I do.  Why would you do such a thing?  Are you still watching, are you still listening to the show?  Yeah.  All right.  Say no more.  Say no more.  All right.  Back to Karen Meyer.  Iraq, what are you, what are you saying?  In the audio for that clip, Opie's in the background goes, he's laughing, he goes, what happened  to your father?  And I think that's what set her off crying.  Oh, no, you didn't.  No, stop. 
[01:49:00]  I wouldn't say that.  What happened to your father?  You absolutely would.  I don't know.  I don't remember the circumstances.  Maybe there was...  It's out of context.  Yeah, exactly.  Maybe it was funny.  All right.  Karen Meyer, Crip Slam Sunday started last year, so more info on this showcase she does.  The idea of having Crip Slam Sunday started last spring.  After Bodies Divorce, the Disability Arts and Culture Festival.  Sandy Schoenner is the Associate's Artistic Director. 
[01:49:30]  What?  Associate what director?  What?  She's also...  She's got an ugly voice.  Like, I can hear the mustache in her voice.  It's like an ugly voice.  Just in every way, if you're picking someone to broadcast, this is the wrong person.  What did she say?  Hey, she's got an ugly voice.  What?  Sandy Schoenner is the Associate's Artistic Director.  Oh, the spit.  We didn't want it to just fade away after the Bodies of Work and the huge push that had  been in for that festival, so we wanted to extend the events and hopefully extend the 
[01:50:00]  audience and bring them into Victory Gardens around the calendar.  Techies Clothing Action Off is the first of four series scheduled for this winter and  spring.  And we hope to have maybe five events each year with different performers, different  readings, different artists coming and talking about their work in different...  Your claws in the back is when the girl put her claws back on. 
[01:50:30]  Finally!  What's with...  Like, why so much...  I don't know!  Is it saliva or just earwax that had nowhere to go?  Nothing to do?  The thing is that...  Just backing up.  You can't criticize somebody who's doing that.  Like, there's no...  The problem with putting somebody like that in that job is that you can no longer go,  like, is she a good reporter?  Yeah.  Do you have any skills?  Yeah.  She sounds lazy.  She's not compelling to listen to.  She stinks.  Yeah, there's no, like, emotion to her voice.  She's not getting into the thing, like, you know...  The fact that God doesn't love her is only the beginning of the problem. 
[01:51:00]  After that, it's all her fault.  Let's go to Pat in New York.  Pat, what's up?  Pat.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  All right.  I got a great spin on this.  You should have the interns try to translate what she's saying without the subtitles.  Well, that's not a bad idea.  How funny would that be?  Yeah, if you listen to her a few times, you can kind of get the hang of it.  Really?  A little.  There are a few words that are impossible.  Well, you don't have that...  I heard, like, associate and director before.  They don't have that option when you're watching the news.  No, no.  You know it works even better.  People that can talk. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, people that can talk and actually be reporters.  It's just showing the rest of the reporters, too, like, wow, I really don't have a job  that is worth anything.  Why doesn't Karen Meyer get a job, like, working at Madison Square Garden, setting up, like,  the things that they have to wear their earbuds for so they don't get...  Anything you need ear protection for, she can do and save the cost of the ear protection.  She should work next to a jackhammer.  Jackhammer, dynamiting mountainsides for highways.  Yeah, essentially, a tarmac.  She should be waving planes and they would have to waste money on those things. 
[01:52:00]  Imagine how weird that would be.  You'd look out the window and go, wow, she doesn't even have those orange little headphones  on.  She'd be just waving the plane in.  Yeah.  Of course, another one's hitting her because you can't hear a 747 come up behind her.  It snuck up on me.  I bet it did.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Long time listening.  Yo, that last caller that called up and said he was offended by what you guys were saying,  he's probably a midget, number one.  And number two, this is the funniest friggin' show I've ever listened to on the way to work,  man.  You guys suck.  Oh, thank you.  Spread the word for us, will ya? 
[01:52:30]  That's how the ONA virus works.  Thank you very much.  Let's go to Jared in the Bronx.  Jared.  What's going on?  Hey.  Just a quick question.  When she talks, is it like that bouncy ball on the bottom to translate the road?  Follow the bouncing ball.  Follow the bouncing ear.  Just an ear with the red circle and slash through it.  Just bouncing off the words.  All right.  We got the last clip here for today.  Karen Meyer is deaf and it makes me laugh.  Whatever that means.  We'll find out, I guess. 
[01:53:00]  Crips Slam Sunday is part of the theater's access project.  Which is responsible for making the theater accessible for patrons with disabilities.  We want to make sure that everyone can come.  Anyone with a disability can come.  Here's the Crips Slam Sunday presentations.  The sun's out.  Oh, come on.  Take off that swimsuit.  If I can do it, you can.  Ooh.  Keep it on.  You're a freak. 
[01:53:30]  We're going to have to host us at 7.30 p.m. at Victory Gardens Greenhouse.  You can always go to our website, ABC7Tocogo.com.  It's this Sunday, January 28th.  All right.  Thanks very much.  You're welcome.  Go to our website.  I always end up, it's like a porno site.  I screwed up.  I got like spyware on my computer now.  It's like somebody threw a bunch of consonants in her mouth.  Tumbling out of everything.  You might as well just punch the keyboard and add .com. 
[01:54:00]  Because that's about what she did.  That's what she said.  Gargling with alphabet soup.  Could you say something of substance, you silly ghost?  And the reporters, the other newswomen, they seem bothered coming out of that story.  Like, thanks, Karen.  Thanks, Karen.  When is this gag going to be over with?  She wants to watch a 3-5 woman naked.  Pedophiles enjoy that lady.  She's terrible.  All right.  Like I said, freak show factor.  You would want to see that. 
[01:54:30]  But there's no artistic thing going on where it's like, wow, people are really, really.  Like, this woman's delusional.  She's like, wow, you know, I'm so confident.  And if I'm naked up here, it shows that, look, we're all the same.  And we have.  No.  It's sitting there going, I want to see a freak naked.  That's it.  The naked.  The value of naked people on stage is very basic.  Yeah.  There's no nuance to that.  No.  You're either, you know, aroused or you're laughing.  Or laughing hysterical. 
[01:55:00]  Right.  You're not learning.  No, you're not learning.  My mind is just broadening that naked midget.  Fantastic.  I'm learning something about myself here.  We got a request coming in from Craig in Florida.  Craig, what's up?  Hey, how's it going?  I love the show.  Yeah, I just want to hear you guys do David Caruso, do a Karen Meyer.  Karen Meyer.  PSI style.  Slash David Caruso?  Yeah.  Hmm.  Let me think here.  I have no idea what to say as Karen Meyer.  It doesn't have to make sense. 
[01:55:30]  Oh.  Meb Bank.  It's not too much to say, Jim, but they serve by Sunday.  All right.  It's as good as you get.  We'll play What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony Show.  You little parrot.  Maybe get into Tyra Banks a little bit.  Don't forget Lucky Louie on DVD starting today.  Today.  Get it?  Louie C.K. in studio today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Fire.  The Opie and Anthony Fire. 
[01:56:00]  Ooh.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Anthony and Forrest Hills, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  You guys, that was the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  But listen, at the end of that bit, the funniest part of that bit was when she returns it to the newscasters.  And it's almost as if the newscasters picked up the jellyfish.  And they were like, oh, thank you very much. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, they were very annoyed that they have to be part of that circus.  I didn't catch that.  Yeah, they sounded very...  You've got to play that again.  It's hysterical, guys.  See ya.  All right.  Quieter.  Yeah, we'll try to get that on.  And then during the commercial break, we're watching the local news here.  We want to be informed.  We're a morning show.  People want their news and their weather.  Sports scores and all that crap.  So we try to work it into the silliness.  So we got like, what, four or five news channels on.  We got the CNN. 
[01:57:00]  We got Good Morning America.  We do a little Fox News channel over here.  And then we do a couple locals up here on this wall.  And Fox 5 here in New York did a, like, it wasn't even a short story.  It was like a five-minute story on roller skating.  Yep.  On roller, people roller skating.  Gay guys roller skating.  Gay guys.  And she's talking to them.  And they're going, see how there's wheels on the shoes.  And you roll around.  You roll.  Really?  Wheels on shoes now.  Skating.  It was that indoor, you know, skating. 
[01:57:30]  Right.  Like old school style.  Not with the inline skates.  But it's just somebody was, this woman was at the pitch meeting for the news show and  said, I'd like to go over to that place where they roll a skate.  Oh, that's a good idea.  We'll send you right over there.  Okay.  Drive through all those neighborhoods full of poor people with interesting things going  on.  Yeah, right.  You're the news, stupid.  All right.  Take truck five.  There's nothing going on.  Set yourself up with a crew.  Right.  Nothing going on in New York City.  We have, you know, like Anthony, Opie was saying, there's a war going on.  Yeah.  And no one cares. 
[01:58:00]  Well, if there wasn't a war going on, maybe you need to fill up the news with some dumb  things.  But I mean, we're living in some pretty interesting times and you still go to the roller skating  story.  You know, I might not even be able to come up with the things that you could do a story  on.  But skating is probably so far down on the list.  And if you want to keep it light, there's something with Iraq soldiers.  There's there may be some kind of light light.  No, light artillery.  No, obviously the only light thing.  Obviously, there's horrific things going on. 
[01:58:30]  And what?  We're over 3000 dead.  But I'm saying at least make it about the war somehow.  Or I don't know.  Maybe if you're going to do special interest stories, do them about a town in Iraq, like  Fallujah, like little fun things that they do for entertainment.  Like, you know, here they dig a dirt bunker and they hide and the children run around with  bombs strapped to them.  Teedley.  Teedley, something cute.  And Louis C.K. was saying during the break that he would love to just take over a news  channel.  Oh, yeah.  Just a news station.  Just go to like some crappy little market.  Yeah, go to like whatever, Buffalo or Dayton, Ohio. 
[01:59:00]  Hey, hey.  We love Buffalo.  All right.  Dayton.  Go with Dayton.  Or Houston.  Buffalo.  Buffalo suffers enough.  Youngstown, Ohio.  Take their lowest rated local news and just say, just give me the station for two weeks.  Don't tell me what to do.  No, nothing about news.  You'll be number one in three nights.  I guarantee you're right.  You're absolutely right.  If you had no regard, but you have the same equipment, you have vans with satellites and  all that ability.  And press passes.  Yep.  Like wherever you want to go.  We're going to go to the city council meeting and just shout, shut up during the entire, 
[01:59:30]  whatever, whatever it is.  Yeah.  Or just cover, like just go to somebody's house, a random house and say, we're doing a week  of features on this person and just bother them.  A week.  Just bother them day after day after day.  Now we want to talk to you more about what happened when we were in high school.  Nothing happened.  At least that wouldn't be faking that you're making a difference and informing the people  because this is just entertainment.  Yeah.  And that's all it would be.  No, it's even worse.  It's a small town.  Like I live near Albany and I get the Albany local news and everyone's doing the same story 
[02:00:00]  about some guy who moved into an old, like just broke into an old lady's house and we  live there raping her, eating her food and watching her TV for like three weeks.  It's great.  And then finally somebody came to visit her that didn't love her enough to come three  weeks earlier.  And they went, oh my God, who's this guy that's been raping you all this time?  And she's like, thank you.  Hello.  And all four stations are there talking to her and the guy and that's all there is.  I didn't know the neighbors. 
[02:00:30]  No, something was going on there, but I just, she was always very, she never really came out  a lot anyway.  Yeah.  That's when they find the crazy cat lady.  She's been dead for like a month and you realize, where was, was there anybody that  called or?  Cat feces up to the window.  Yeah.  That's always good.  Right.  Oh, uh, it's so common too.  We got today's PSA.  Ooh.  Okay.  Yeah.  Very, very serious.  We do work here.  Yeah.  Very serious.  We try to get things done with our airtime.  Okay.  Shira and I want to talk to you about something that's very personal. 
[02:01:00]  Your body.  Remember, it's your body and no one should touch you in a way that you feel is wrong.  I'll get it.  Everybody who tries it.  It's not that easy or who.  How is that?  It's hard for a young person to admit that he or she has been touched in a bad way.  If you've been touched that way, don't be ashamed.  Tell someone you trust, like your parents, your doctor, your teacher, or counselor.  She was very badly raped, you see?  Right, Orko?  Right on.  Victim of the morning age. 
[02:01:30]  Go for down.  And in the next scene, they should show someone confessing, I was touched, and then none of  the adults believing it.  You're a dirty liar.  Shut up, liar.  You're just trying to ruin my relationship.  You're just trying to get some ice cream.  Your stepfather pays the bills in this house.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What is that from?  I don't know.  You missed the last part.  What are the characters?  About talking to a...  Some...  Clergy?  Well, they didn't mention priest, though.  They didn't say talk to your clergy? 
[02:02:00]  Oh, it's He-Man and She-Ra.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  That way, don't be ashamed.  Tell someone you trust, like your parents, your doctor, your teacher, or counselor, or  your minister or rabbi.  Minister or rabbi?  Right on.  Not a Catholic priest, though.  Don't ask them, because they might masturbate to the story.  They say, you're a rabbi or a priest.  They show a rabbi, but the priest is, like, hiding himself under a coach, being led away.  Police officer. 
[02:02:30]  Don't tell a priest.  He's going to ask for way too many details.  That's right.  Talk to your priest in prison and tell him about it.  Talk to the priest.  The kid points at him.  That's him, mommy!  Well, you're confessing to your priest.  You remember when you and I did that?  Confess to your priest if you can find out what parish he's been shipped to.  Quit me and I'm over the night.  Yeah, priests move like sports teams move.  Oh, my God.  In the middle of the night when no one's looking.  Get him out.  We traded him.  Right in the teeth. 
[02:03:00]  That's a great point.  Just change their name.  Like, close them down, change their name, and get them back up on in front of everybody.  Put them in another church.  We couldn't call the cops.  He had a no-prosecution clause in his contract.  It's really true that the Catholic Church, if you look at it from that...  I mean, if you landed on this planet and looked at the Catholic Church, you go, so they exist  to have sex with boys.  Yeah.  Like, they are...  That's what they do.  They are the greatest boys' sex network ever...  Everything they do facilitates sex with little children.  Yeah.  With children.  Every single thing.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Aliens would say that, and, oh, wow, and they run the whole planet because apparently they  get away with it, too, so...  Tax-deductible boys' sex.  Hey, let's go to Jay in Florida.  Awesome.  Jay's got a confession.  Jay?  Yeah.  Awesome.  I tell you, at least 80% of the gay community skate, and you really haven't made love to a  man, unless you've done it on a pair of skates.  There's, like, no work is required.  You just roll back and forth.  You could have just ended that sentence with us before the skate part. 
[02:04:00]  You really haven't made love to a man.  Just stop right there.  Skates don't really come into play.  Well, that's the whole part of skating that's interesting.  All right.  Go ahead.  You talk.  Why would I want to chime in?  It's all about you.  Go ahead.  Get your thing in.  Go ahead.  Go ahead, sir.  Finish up.  I didn't mean to interrupt with a joke attempt.  Yeah.  Go right ahead and keep barreling through.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Come on.  What were you trying to say, Jay?  I was trying to say that, you know, I strongly agree with, like, gay roller skating is just  fabulous, and I'd love to see Jimmy in a pair of roller skates and short shorts. 
[02:04:30]  Is this, like, try to make a bit guy?  I don't know.  Is he trying to?  What are you doing, sir?  You want me to cut the back out of my shorts and, like, learn to, like, touch my toes and  skate backwards, sir?  What's the gay roller skating mean?  You're obviously not a gay roller skater.  I'm backing off on my way to work here.  I really am.  Do you realize that we almost had a perfect radio show?  Wow.  Almost.  We were so close.  We were so close.  We were so close.  Right.  It's going to go into the books as a 99.9% perfect show. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, shut up, Jay.  It didn't work.  You stink.  Hold on.  I want you to sign my balls.  I want you to sign my balls to the buzzer.  You stink.  Good day, sir.  Good day.  He's getting dumped out of, stupid Jay.  He's getting dumped out of.  He just, oh, my God.  What didn't get dumped, just stunk.  We were hoping to give the people one last laugh before we got out of here.  Yep.  Now that's not going to happen. 
[02:05:30]  Now that call should be treated with radiation.  Didn't even talk like a deaf lady.  No.  We're going to have to go old school just to get a laugh out.  It's Marty in Connecticut.  Hey, what do you call a gay roller skater?  I don't know.  What do you call a gay roller skater, Marty?  Roll-aids.  What?  Roll-aids.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's a 1986 joke.  Well, roll-aids are actually technically used for acid and digestion.  I don't see how that ties in.  True.  I didn't even look into it logically like that. 
[02:06:00]  Yeah, I don't get it.  Oh, look at the music came on, Opie.  Yeah.  You hit a button.  That Jay, we all bombed after Jay called.  Yeah.  That's right.  He sucked the energy out.  What a way to end.  That's it.  We want to end on an up note today.  That's right.  You want to laugh today?  Here's what you do.  Huh?  You go to the store.  Uh-huh.  You pick up Lucky Louie.  Oh, look at that.  And you pop it in.  And you've seen an episode.  You go, oh, okay.  Let me watch it with some commentary.  That's what I do now.  That's right.  Very good. 
[02:06:30]  I'm not a good plugger.  I just go, that's right.  That's terrible.  Louis C.K., thank you.  Thank you.  We got to get out of here, guys.  All right.  We'll see you on XM side.  Yeah, tomorrow.  And tomorrow here.  Sure.  Yes.  Hi.  All right.  This is really how it ends.  This sucks.  No, it's good.  You got to give it a good ending.  A good ending.  Go ahead.  Good out.  Good out, Jim.  Hey, take care.  Careful out there.  Except for Jay.  I hope you die within a week.  How about, hey, thanks to everybody. 
[02:07:00]  Except Karen Meyer.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Oh, I got it.  I got it.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  It's been real.  It's been nice.  But it hasn't been real nice.  Waka waka.  Waka waka.  See you tomorrow.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony XM202.  The Opie and Anthony XM202.  The Opie and Anthony XM202. 
[02:07:30]  The Opie and Anthony XM202. 
[02:08:00]  The Opie and Anthony XM202. 
[02:08:30]  The Opie and Anthony XM202. 
[02:09:00]  Thank you. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you. 
[02:10:30]  This is something people would believe.  Wow, how long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing? 
[02:11:00]  All day long.  Shut up.  All right, here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Corn balls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of Tylenol CM. 
[02:11:30]  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  La la. 
[02:12:00]  La la.  See if they get this right.  Just send someone out for the Vista.  Are you getting the Vista?  See if they get it right.  I bet they don't.  Nah, they'll get it right.  There's 18,000 different versions.  So you guys don't do a walkover anymore.  You play a 15-minute bit and then EOG, what's that?  Elite speak.  Ecstasy of gold.  Oh, Ecstasy of gold for another 10 minutes.  Why even do an XM show?  It's obvious you only care about the FM show. 
[02:12:30]  Right.  Okay, there you go.  What's his name?  Eric L.  Dainey.  Dainsey.  Who?  Just another uninformed dope.  Oh, God, you're an asshole.  Dainsey from Wackbag.  Wackbag.com.  Is he?  Is he really?  Probably not.  So if we're just calling in the XM show every day, don't you think we're going to be in deep  trouble with our bosses at XM Satellite Radio? 
[02:13:00]  They're very happy with what we're doing, you dope.  You think we're so great at radio that we can just call it in and no one's going to notice  and we're not going to be thrown off the radio eventually?  You dope.  Because of him, I suggest, and I mean this, we do a call it in show today for XM.  Oh, fuck.  Here it goes.  I'm not doing shit.  I'm going to fucking relax and not work like I do every day when I come in here because  that cunt has just accused us of calling in. 
[02:13:30]  And let's show them calling it in.  Here's calling it in.  What do you want to do?  First of all, I'm not even going to be professional on the mic.  I'll just go like, what do you want to do today?  Do you want to, Jimmy, did anything happen?  I want to promote Houston this weekend.  Okay.  I'm doing the improv.  There you go.  That'll be great radio.  This 3D new Saturday.  Don't let your real, and I'm serious, your professionalism will jump in and Opie will go,  no, we got to do a show.  I'm fucking serious because of this cunt rag. 
[02:14:00]  I don't want to fucking do a show.  I'm sitting here and just, no.  There we go.  No, no, no.  That's a joke, son.  No.  There's going to get in.  Oh.  There you go.  Only another hour and fucking 40 minutes of this left. 
[02:14:30]  If you could keep doing this, it'd be great.  It really was.  All right, that's our first break.  Now let's take a fucking commercial because we're phoning it in.  We don't do commercials.  You dumb fuck.  You stupid fuck.  See what you did?  Look what you do now.  Look what you fucking did now. 
[02:15:00]  Fucking idiots.  I don't know.  His mother has two holes and shit comes out of both of them.  I just hate.  You did something good.  Sorry.  I just hate dumb, stupid people, and there seems to be a lot of them on Wackbag.  What a cunt.  I'm sorry, Wackbag, because you guys do a lot of great things for the show, but there's  a lot of dummies that you allow to just control the place from time to time.  We can't phone in anything.  Do you understand that?  Phone it in.  If he was going to phone in, it would be a day off.  Do you understand?  You call up and go, I'm not coming in. 
[02:15:30]  That's phoning it in.  Do you understand that we just can't do that even if we wanted to, because eventually they'd  be on to us, and we would not be doing a show.  We wouldn't have our own channel on XM.  Can't you think through some of your stupid thoughts sometimes, Steve?  How about this?  How about this?  This morning at 5 a.m., I had the phone in my hand, and I said to myself, I'm too sick  to come in today.  And I was going to call in, because I know he's just about ready to commute.  And I'm like, I'll even save him the drive instead of getting the good news when he gets 
[02:16:00]  to work.  Yeah, that would suck.  And then I'm thinking, you know what?  We're not in a position right now to take any days off.  We took a lot around the holidays because of the shit that was happening with Jay Leno  and doing a speech for the big boss and then taking our normal vacation.  I'm like, fuck, I am really sick and should have just taken today off, but I know we just  can't in the overall scheme of things.  So I dragged my ass in, and then I said to Anthony at the other office, I'm like, Ant,  would you mind if I just went home after the first part of the show?  Because I really just need to rest and get myself together before this turns into 
[02:16:30]  like a week of being sick.  And then something got to me.  I'm like, you know what?  Fuck it.  We'll do the second half of the show.  So then they decide to help me out personally by playing a longer bit that no one has heard  in probably five fucking years.  Right.  And this Danesie has to fucking go with the old gag.  You know, they're calling it in bit.  Calling it in.  Good job, you douchebag.  And no, I'm not starting to promote FBA either.  It's the same animal. 
[02:17:00]  You people think all these...  It's fucking...  You know what?  You know what?  FBA.com, the full-blown age site and whack bag alike, that stupid Star Trek episode  with the guy with the half-white face and half-black face and the half-black face, half-white face,  Frank Gorshin.  Yeah.  Where they're fighting.  And then they ask him, what are you fighting about?  You're both half-white and half-black.  He goes, but he's half-black on the left side, and I'm half-black on the right side.  It's the same fucking thing.  You could go there, too, and see other shitheads fucking...  With the same input.  By the way, the XM show has been better than the first half of the show lately. 
[02:17:30]  And then, you know, a week or two will go by, and the first half of the show will be better than the XM show.  Oh, depending on them.  Yeah, yeah.  But no, that's just how it is.  It's how the show goes.  And then they're like, oh, they're paying more attention to the FM.  Oh, they're paying more attention to the XM show.  No.  Oh, they're giving up on this.  Oh, they're phoning this.  No, we have to pay attention for five to five and a half hours a day, depending if we're staying late or not.  That guy's infuriating.  And then you get other guys.  Why don't you go until noon?  Because we don't have to go to noon.  They want us to go to 11. 
[02:18:00]  When we go past 11, that's because we're having fun or we're trying to get something done before we go home.  I'll get a real fucking job if I want to work that many hours.  Five hours a day is a long show.  My garden is some sympathy here.  I doubt it.  Jamesy, you're a piece of shit, and you know it.  Yes, you are.  You're a piece of shit.  I have a question for Steve.  Here's your fucking brain.  Raise your hand then, Jimmy.  We can't call in anything ever.  Steve, call on Jimmy.  He's raising his hand.  I'll wait till we don't. 
[02:18:30]  I have a question for you about somebody pointing something out to you.  That's all.  All right.  It was a humor remover.  That's why.  Oh.  What were you wearing on your back before?  Microphone, please.  Microphone.  Why would he have a mic?  What was I wearing on my back?  Why would it be on?  Why would it be on?  Why would it work?  And now once it's on, we're like, why was that turned on?  Why is he speaking?  I believe I was wearing a post-it note.  On the back?  It said what?  On the back of my leather jacket that said gay police. 
[02:19:00]  Yes.  I didn't put it there.  I just saw it.  And as you should, I found it amusing.  It's funny.  It was on during the elevator ride and everything.  What happened to that thing?  It got pulled off by Poe, I believe.  Fuck it.  Why?  You see?  Oh, boy.  Why?  I don't know.  Perhaps he was being considerate.  That's what I was...  Why would you do that?  Inconsiderate to people that are laughing at you, though.  I didn't...  It's inconsiderate to...  And what is the great of the good of the more?  Why would you remove a gay police sticker from a gay cop's back? 
[02:19:30]  Wait, Hato.  He's like, you never passed the police test.  Paul, what...  Why would you do that, Paul?  I caught part of it, so I didn't...  I didn't know if Steve had seen it or not.  Did you pull off a post-it off his back?  I just saw...  It's like Karate Kid music.  I just saw Steve walking away that said gay police on his back.  Yeah.  I found it very amusing.  Hysterical.  It was funny.  And it was on the whole elevator ride up and everything. 
[02:20:00]  People saw it.  They didn't even know.  And the walkover.  And even if you saw it after three times I've seen it, it still made you go.  Of course it's funny.  He's still on that.  He's a gay police man.  Why would you take it off his back?  It was great.  It was funny.  I loved it.  I laughed also.  Why'd you take it off his back?  Yeah.  I thought it was one of the guys that did it.  I didn't know.  Who did it?  I don't know.  I didn't do it.  Dude, it doesn't matter if an intern did it.  One of the guys did do it.  I'm sure it wasn't actually the police commissioner.  He didn't actually even give an honorary sheriff's assistant. 
[02:20:30]  That's a weird way they do it secretly.  See, that's one of those jokes that doesn't really have a time frame.  It could go for all day long.  Really?  All day long.  Yeah.  Well, it's almost like you don't want to run up and go, hey, fella, you almost got kicked.  Look at the sign on your back.  You kind of want him to keep it on.  He'd get kicked all day.  I wonder what happened.  Yeah.  I was like, why would he take it off?  I didn't know why.  I wasn't angry about it because I saw it and laughed at him.  But I'm like, one of the guys probably did do it.  Probably Travis or...  Of course.  Or fucking Sam.  Was it Sam? 
[02:21:00]  Sam.  Of course it was.  He's evil.  I can't take credit for it this time.  Was it Travis?  It was Danny.  It was Danny?  Danny did it.  Oh, Danny.  There was a guy on the elevator who, when Steve walked off, said, I didn't even know  there was a gay police without even talking to him.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Apparently, I'm an honorary member.  So, what happened?  Your head running is awful.  I can't read that.  I don't know.  That's just my nature.  I try to...  I know humor.  I know you're a protector.  We get it.  No, but that's weird, though, because it wasn't like... 
[02:21:30]  That's almost like someone...  If someone said, two Jews walk into a bar, he'd walk into the room and go, well, who  did they lease it or own it?  All right.  All right.  I just wanted to get to the bottom of it.  I didn't know why.  High doses of post-it glue can be toxic, gentlemen.  I was saving him.  All right, Paul.  And I have...  Thanks for making the show safe.  I have...  Jesus.  There we go.  I have...  Hey, Danesie... 
[02:22:00]  And after we wrap...  Hold on, hold on.  Danesie, first of all, is not a guy.  Hey, it's a girl.  Danesie.  Oh, it's a girl.  Hey, cunt.  How you doing there?  Hey, cunt.  You old dick ditch.  Yeah.  You're bleeding, so we all have to suffer.  How you doing?  Well, Danesie, what was that about?  What's up, bloody twat?  Guys, guys, guys.  It was not me.  I just got out of a meeting.  I get back to my desk, and I'm getting all sorts of messages saying, oh, my God, you 
[02:22:30]  ruined the show.  Someone doesn't like you.  Okay, so it was somebody using your name.  Okay.  Yeah, that happened.  Wow, that's real brave for the person that's using your name.  Guys, I can't even hear the show at my desk.  Guilt by association.  Go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Still enjoying hating you.  Yeah, I know.  Fuck off.  I really didn't like you.  I can't just snap out of it now.  Yeah.  Even if you're totally innocent.  It doesn't matter.  The mob's got the rope around your neck.  Come on.  Kick, spank the horse in the ass and watch you hang, you cunt. 
[02:23:00]  I just, I feel really...  Yeah, at this point, we've got to hang somebody.  For nothing.  Yeah, it's your fault.  Sorry.  Well, I heard that Anthony called me a very vicious name, so I had to call in and defend  myself.  What did I call you?  You called me a cunt.  Everyone called you a cunt.  The world did.  God did.  But the difference is I love you, Anthony.  But it wasn't...  In the world court, you're a cunt.  It's too late.  Even though you did nothing wrong.  It wasn't you.  It was whoever took your name.  Somebody doesn't like me, so I just felt like I had to call in.  Now there's controversy. 
[02:23:30]  Coke Logic saying that another board is sending an instant feedback.  Yeah, see?  That's what I mean.  Half black, half white.  So full-blown aides is battling with whack bag.  We know this battle has been going on for years and caused thousands of innocent lives.  It is the dumbest thing.  It's amazing.  Message board fights are hysterically stupid.  This one's blaming this.  There's soap operas that go on.  Amazing.  Board gossip.  Resil.  No, it's amazing.  If you go, like, if you're trying to find out something like, like you're trying to buy 
[02:24:00]  a digital camera.  Yeah.  So you go on some message site to find out if the Sony cybershot is decent.  And you read...  Want some advice for people that have used it.  Yeah, and the username is like, it knows cameras or something.  And he's saying, last time that you insulted me, I, and then Joey, whatever.  Nickname.  And how dare you come?  I've been on this board since before it.  What the fuck?  Does anybody talk about cameras?  I'm trying to buy a camera.  They trash it.  The fucking...  The Sony's a piece of shit.  And the guy's name is Ted Cannon.  I have girl questions, too, whenever we're... 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I'm just...  All right, so I...  Just use your brain.  It's all we're getting at.  Hold on.  We can't call in anything.  It's impossible.  It's like we're untouchable or something.  And we make the rules and we can just, like, call in radio shows.  Are you nuts?  Someone's called the situation with the girl a cuntastrophe.  Right.  All right, what's your question there?  Louie just had a very funny line, too.  I said, I have girl questions, and Louie said, the dick goes in the cunt. 
[02:25:00]  That's all you gotta know.  Don't put it in her nose.  Stick it in her cunt.  Why, whenever I pull it out of her fucking pussy, is there earwax on it?  Wait, oh, I see.  Stick it in her cunt.  Oh, hey.  And then walk away.  All right, what do you got, Jimmy?  Let's just say you're talking to a girl.  Let's just say that it's a girl that you're in love with or whatever.  And I'm not saying this happened with my girlfriend.  I'm just saying if it never happened.  And you're talking about an experience she had that she said sexually was not good.  Right.  Like, ah, man, I really felt bad. 
[02:25:30]  It was gross.  And then you're at dinner talking, and she goes, I just remembered, like, I came four  times during that.  But it was really repulsive.  So she came even though it was bad?  Wow.  That happened to me one time years ago.  She brought it up.  No, well, I had actually.  How did it get brought up?  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait a minute.  You mean something that happened with her and somebody else?  Yeah.  What happened was this.  I was dating a girl once who had a sexual encounter.  She was talking about it.  What was the sexual encounter that she?  She had sex with a guy. 
[02:26:00]  How was it brought up?  I ask sex questions.  Oh, okay.  But I forget how.  Why would you do that to yourself?  I'm crazy.  You ask a girl about sex she's had before.  Why would you torture her?  And she said it was bad before, and then she later said she came four times during it.  Well, yeah, but she said it was bad.  Not bad like a rape, but just like, ugh, I felt gross.  It wasn't enjoyable.  But she came four times.  Was it because of, I know you don't want to get into specifics, so we'll go around.  No, no, no.  I see how far you want to go. 
[02:26:30]  Was it because of who the person was, the location, the sex act?  Like, what about this situation was repulsive to her?  I think it was the person that she was hooking up with.  I think she wasn't that, again, I didn't get into all the details.  I think it was like someone that she wasn't that attracted to, but just kind of liked as  a person.  I think it was more like that kind of vibe.  Like, it wasn't, it was completely consensual, but it was like, eh.  It wasn't any type of a negro. 
[02:27:00]  It wasn't like a negro.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I thought I'd throw that out there.  No, don't put that thought in my head.  No, no, no.  It was just like that, and it wouldn't have been a big deal if she enjoyed it.  It was like years before we met.  It was nothing.  So what's the problem?  My question is, it was not really a problem.  It was like, oh, it was really gross, and then like we were talking about something.  How much later?  Did hours go by or days go by?  Oh, like weeks.  Weeks went by. 
[02:27:30]  And then saying I was reading something I wrote about it at the time, like kept like  a diary or something, and goes, I came four times.  I didn't even remember that.  Like, I didn't remember that that happened.  So she remembered it being gross, but then thinking, looking back at her records.  Her records of the fuck.  I went to the hall of sexual records.  It says here I came four times.  I'm so surprised.  I remember hating on that.  No, but she's still saying, maybe you don't understand, but to me it was like a weird reaction.  It still wasn't a sexy experience to me, even though I did.  I kind of believe her, but I don't.  But here's my question for you. 
[02:28:00]  Does this concern you, or are you just curious about it?  More curiosity.  I don't know if it concerns me or not.  Is it a threat to me?  No.  I mean, it was long before people ever knew each other.  But you're trying to learn something about your girl if you're trying to understand.  Did you ask her about it?  Yeah, I don't know.  It's not actually the girl I'm dating now.  It's an old girl.  No, of course.  Years ago.  Of course.  I don't know.  It's just fucking sex freaks me out, man.  See, he doesn't feel threatened by it now.  Right.  But there's something about it that isn't sitting right. 
[02:28:30]  Right.  Right.  Because you were told it was this repulsive kind of thing like that.  Yet her coming four times in some way makes you feel like you're not doing something you could be doing.  Well, coming isn't always a positive.  I mean, you know, I was getting blown by a hooker in a condemned building once with, like, a broken window.  And I thought I was going to get mugged because she had some weird friend in the next room. 
[02:29:00]  It was a really bad situation.  And I came, you know.  No, no, no.  That girl later became my wife.  Right.  But I'm saying, like, I was even at the time joking with her.  And I'm like, you know, you don't, like, just a word of advice.  You don't tell the guy you're dating that you came four times with someone when the guy you're dating has never made you come four times.  Oh, I see.  Like, you don't.  Right, right.  No, no, no, no.  I know.  I know.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not mad.  I wasn't mad then.  You haven't broken that record, that barrier. 
[02:29:30]  I don't know what it is.  I can't give you a logical answer.  Are you sure she wasn't kidding?  Why would you ask to?  That would be hysterical.  What a great joke to play on, Jimmy.  Just to sit there and laugh and go, I bet this fucker is toiling over this.  I don't know.  Why?  There's, like, a certain line you go through.  Have you made her come yet?  Yes.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, you know.  But not four times.  Is that really the thing?  Four times by having a lousy fucking time.  Yeah.  Yeah, like, I just, it's almost like, I don't know.  I'm in therapy now.  I went back to therapy, so I'm, like, going through all these weird sexual questions and stuff. 
[02:30:00]  Not, like, you know, but just, like, bizarre.  Like, what do I like sexually?  Like, am I a pervert?  Do I want to spank somebody?  Do I want to be gentle?  Like, I don't even know when I'm turned on half the time.  It's like, I'm such an addict.  I'm going to jerk off so much, I'm having this weird stuff with sex.  Your therapy can't wait for you to come in.  I'm late.  She's never complaining.  Ah, don't worry.  No, you're the kind of patient she trained for.  Oh, yeah.  I'm a mess.  She told me.  Everybody else is like, my boss said something weird today.  Yeah, right, right.  Get Jimmy in here.  I just fucking hook her shat in my mouth. 
[02:30:30]  I'm not sure how I felt about it.  Is it kind of a situation?  Well, Jim, let's talk.  I can't believe you asked the current girlfriend about her past.  I know.  She said to me, she goes, I've never had a guy ask me these questions before.  That's good.  That's good.  And a part of me doesn't.  Like, part of me doesn't because.  I think most guys out there would not ask.  Yeah, but a part of me is like, a part of me, A, likes to hurt myself.  So wants to hear bad things.  Obvious.  But if there's a weird OCD thing I have, which you'll get, it's like, I almost feel  like it's dishonest. 
[02:31:00]  It's like, if there's a fact there, like, I almost like, if it's not spoken about, it's  dishonest.  I know that sounds crazy, but it's like, if I'm fucking a girl, right, and she doesn't  think my dick is big enough, even though she loves me and she's enjoying sex with me,  if she doesn't think my dick's big enough, that's a fact.  So it's almost like, I don't want to be patronized by not being told that.  Like, do you understand what I'm saying?  No, that's all problems inside of your brain.  You're fine, right?  If you're fucking a girl, this is Jim's brain.  He's fucking a girl. 
[02:31:30]  What you should be thinking of is, oh, pussy around my dick, I can't wait to come in her  stupid mouth.  Yes.  That's all you should be thinking.  But you're thinking, I know that deep down inside she thinks my dick's not small enough  and if she would just tell me instead of just facade.  I'm screaming while I fuck her.  You're out of your mind.  He probably puts it in and looks for this reaction.  And if he doesn't get it, he's thinking, is my dick too small for this girl?  My dick's too small.  And she's not being honest and telling her.  And his ideal situation would be for her to go, Jimmy, your dick is just not big enough 
[02:32:00]  for me.  And you'd be, oh, the honesty, thank you.  No, but I'd be devastated.  Of course you would.  That's what I'm saying.  You're digging in her subconscious mind and in her past for something to bum yourself  out with.  Yes.  You have a beautiful girlfriend that is funny and that loves you.  Yeah.  And you're looking for some shit.  She told me that too.  You're looking for some crap.  Yeah, what are you fucking looking for?  She said, and I quote, why won't you just let me love you?  Oh, God. 
[02:32:30]  That's simple.  Because my dick's too small and you're a whore that came four times with a guy you hated.  You're dishonest.  But she said to me, she goes, why would you, she goes, why do you think you don't have  what I want?  The point I'm making by telling you this stuff.  You don't think you deserve it.  I pretty much know that it's me.  I'm not an idiot.  Pretty much.  I know that.  You could be absolutely sure.  Here's the good news is that you're a little more conscious and aware than somebody who  just says, fucking a whore doesn't like my dick.  No.  You actually, you're aware that you've got to, you're trying to figure this out, which means 
[02:33:00]  you probably won't figure it out.  Yeah, and you are.  You're, you're, you're a lot more fucking like reasonable about this stuff than I think  you used to be.  Because I know her well enough to know this.  She doesn't cheat.  She's, she's, she doesn't fucking sleep around.  She never, like, I know all these things that I actually know.  I don't just believe because she said it because I know it.  So it's like, well, if I'm having these thoughts, it's got to be fucking, I'm crazy.  Like I'm fucking, I, sometimes I think I'm fucking, like I'm, I'm like not crazy in  a fun way, but then I'm like crazy.  You're trying to take a good thing away from yourself. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, maybe.  You know, you've spent a lot of your life coping with being unhappy and now things are  going for you.  You've got, you're a talented comedian.  You've got a career.  You're actually starting to take care of yourself physically and you've got a girlfriend and  you're not used to that.  So coping with good life is hard if you don't have those skills.  I keep waiting.  So you're trying to go to a comfortable place, which is misery because you're, because you've  given yourself a life of comfort and misery.  You're a therapist is Louis CK.  I know.  What the fuck happened?  And he can't wait for Wednesday afternoons. 
[02:34:00]  But I fucking, it's almost like, I know I've talked about this stuff before, but I know  I'm not alone with it.  I know other, other guys think it.  Um, and I don't know if it's just part of my personality or part of being a comedian,  but it's like, I just say it.  I mean, maybe it's just part of my personality.  I'm sure non-comics have this shit too.  Like a friend of mine told me he used to bang his wife and he would want her to fantasize  and talk about other guys.  And like, I, you know, a way I can understand that in a way I can't, when I want to watch  my girl fuck another guy, absolutely not.  Can it turn me on to think about her just being like in this dirty porn situation and 
[02:34:30]  just sexually?  Sure.  Because I love her and I'm attracted to her to actually see her doing it.  Absolutely not.  So I could never go that far.  No, you, you, yeah, your mind is fun.  It's, it's sexually stimulating.  But I don't know how to take this stuff.  That's what fantasy is.  But, but that's also what the, the past is.  It's nothing more than a fucking vapor cloud of what was, you know?  So you probably shouldn't dwell on that.  I know.  I'm just trying to find a way out of the good.  Yeah.  You're looking for some way out of the good fucking life you're having. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Because you're so used to being miserable and you feel, you deserve to be miserable.  For some reason, you don't feel you deserve happiness.  Yeah, that's what I think it is.  And I don't know why the fuck you would think that.  You don't like every other human.  You don't like yourself well enough.  And was there torturing of little animals growing up?  No.  Is there something in your past that would lead you to not want you to be happy?  You know, there is one other possibility.  Somebody doesn't.  Maybe you just know, because it's true, that you don't deserve to be happy because you're 
[02:35:30]  a bad guy.  Maybe you're just a bad person.  Maybe you're just an asshole.  No.  I would say that someone disappoint you.  I think you're right.  In your formative years, something that you're looking forward to and you just got to take  it away from you.  To manifest into this would have to be a pretty big disappointment.  I think that's probably true.  Not like I'm missing ice cream one day.  And incidentally, my only act of bravery as a child was saving a cat from being tortured  from the neighborhood bully.  I let it out of the box.  Did you?  Yes.  If you flew airplanes and every time you flew one, it crashed.  Somehow you survived.  After a while, you're going to start looking for soft plates to crash. 
[02:36:00]  At least I could crash in that field and not in that fucking thorny tree this time.  So you're looking.  I think that Opie's right.  Somebody bummed you out.  Do other people deal with this shit, though?  It's like, I know this is not.  I'm not so fucking unique.  No, it's not.  Let's go to the phones.  We got a bunch of guys.  Josh in Florida.  What's up, Josh?  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jimmy.  I know exactly what you're talking about.  I think it has something to do with you want them to tell you everything so that you might  have something to resent them for. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, Josh.  Stop phoning it in.  Oh, wait.  There's a caller.  I'm sorry.  It's really the only way he can communicate with the show.  I apologize.  Go ahead, Josh.  That you might have something to resent them for so that when it goes, inevitably it goes  south, you don't hate yourself.  I do stuff like this.  Like, I'll actually, like, I'm running through a scenario the other day, and it's completely  ridiculous. 
[02:37:00]  This is the scenario I run through.  Oh, fuck.  No, no.  But this is how fucking crazy I am.  I do this.  She and I are talking in instant message, and I've done this before.  Like, you ever been talking to someone, and then someone I ams you, and instead of I aming  the person you were talking to, the new I am that clicked on gets the second half of  your sentence, and then we came home yesterday.  And then you're like, what the fuck?  You I am me at the wrong time.  So I was going through this scenario that I was talking to my girlfriend, and she's talking  to some guy who I don't know about, and then I am her when she's not expecting  it, and I get her I am meant for somebody else, and it says, well, he's going to 
[02:37:30]  Sacramento this week.  Maybe we can see each other Saturday.  Well, that could be anything.  Right.  So you just make that up, and then you enjoy, and then you get mad at it.  But not even as a fantasy.  It's just like the way you run through a race or something.  You run through something in your head.  You play it out.  But then all of a sudden-  But yours comes out into real-  Yes.  Emotion.  Actual emotion comes from this fantasy.  No, it's like the grouch and duck soup.  Groucho Marx. 
[02:38:00]  Thanks for taking my point seriously and fucking relating it to duck soup.  Grr, grr, grr, grr.  It's like Daffy Duck said when he-  He's the president of Fredonia, and he's going to meet the president of some other  funny country.  And he's- because they're supposed to go to war, and he wants to- so he says, I'll  shake his hand.  I'll give him my hand in friendship.  But what if he refuses my hand?  How dare he refuse my hand?  All I was trying to do was be his friend, and he makes a fool of me. 
[02:38:30]  How dare- And by the time the guy shows up, he goes, you idiot!  And he slaps him in the face and starts a war.  I do that all the time.  I get furious at shit I made up in my head.  Wow, that is fucked up.  I get really angry.  That is completely fucked up.  That really is fucked up.  But I know it's not real, so I get myself mad.  But then the residue is there, like the smoke.  Yeah.  So I have a bad feeling towards her.  Holy shit, a genuine bad feeling towards her.  You're trying to-  Completely made up fucking-  But the emotion is there, and she's told me, she's like, you have these scenarios, and 
[02:39:00]  then your argument is to try to make that a reality, and she's fucking really- I gotta  say, she's a brilliant person.  I can't-  Well, see, that's why I think this is gonna work out, because I hear you saying that  you guys are talking about this, and that it's-  Well, constantly.  So it's great.  You ever fantasize that she brings two broads over with you?  No.  With her and says, here, come on, let's go.  And then you have this good feeling about her the whole time, Jim?  No, like, she buys you a nice car.  Let's go to Logan.  Logan from Texas.  What's up, Logan?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Love the show.  I thought it was our Elo who fantasizes that his wife brings home a serious- 
[02:39:30]  That's his idea of, like, marital humiliation.  Holds the anger.  Logan is saying that he's sicker than Jimmy.  What's the story, Logan?  Okay, I married this girl.  I've been married two years now.  I fucking am sicker with the questions than Jimmy.  I fucking make this shit up in my head.  Like what?  What do you make up in your head?  Give us an example.  I asked her one day if she had ever slept with an N, and she said yes, she had. 
[02:40:00]  And now every time, she's a delivery driver for a fucking auto parts store, and she has  to deliver to all these auto parts.  Slept with a what?  A black eye.  He called it an N?  An N.  Did you ever sleep with a letter N?  Yes.  And fucking Sesame Street 4.  Why can't you just say black guy instead of N?  An N.  He wanted to be a little more offensive.  Wait, dude, you said, did you ever sleep with a black guy?  She said what? 
[02:40:30]  She said yes.  In real life, she said yes.  Yes, I am fucking just-  I fucking-  I'm way paranoid.  She works at an auto parts store and delivers parts to these auto parts, these fucking mechanic  shops, and I think she sleeps with fucking wet backs and niggers with cute-  Oh, Jesus.  Ploppy neck.  How could she?  Abandoned that whole polite N thing pretty quick.  Why would she cheat on such a charmer?  Charming.  No.  Right.  No, I was a sick mother.  She picked a perfect way to get back at you. 
[02:41:00]  So, no, see, that's actually one thing that I don't care about.  Like, I don't-  I never asked-  I'm like, I asked my girlfriend if she ever dated a black guy, and she's like, no.  But I never asked her if she ever slept with it, and I just don't care about it.  Well, there's your next question.  But no, it wouldn't-  Hold on, sir.  It wouldn't bother me.  That doesn't-  That doesn't freak me out.  Nah, I don't give a fuck.  I've fucking black girls before.  It's like-  Me either in real life, but I'm just fucking-  All right, enough of it.  Enough of it.  Yeah, that doesn't fuck me.  Let's get up, Bruce.  Bruce, what's up?  You have the same problem as Jimmy?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Hey, Bruce, or you start where you want to start.  Go ahead. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah, just-  All right.  I just wanted to agree with Jimmy, man.  I got the same damn problem.  I don't know what it is, but it's like-  That's my question to start the phone call.  What, sir?  What?  I just wanted him to cut to the chase.  Tell me.  All right, go ahead, Bruce.  It's like when you're finally happy, you just-  You can't stand it.  You gotta fucking be miserable again.  Sorry.  Didn't mean to drop the F-bomb.  No, we're on XMU's satellite now.  Cock-knuck-  Dopey-ass-fuck-dick-shit.  Yeah, knucklehead.  I used to have these fantasies.  Like, I was with my wife once we got in a fight in the kitchen, and then I went upstairs 
[02:42:00]  to put one of the kids to sleep.  And as my daughter's sleeping in my arms, I start picturing, I go downstairs, and she's  got a knife, and she just sticks it right in my chest.  Like, I got this, like, really vivid-  Wow.  And then I was thinking the same thing.  I played it all out like I'm in a flight simulator.  I'm like, all right, then what do I do?  I push her hand away.  Maybe I'm still-  She didn't kill me.  Like, and I throw her in the closet, lock the door.  Wow.  And then what do I do?  I'm bleeding to death.  I've still- I gotta get the kids out of the house. 
[02:42:30]  But then I- as soon as I'm in my head in an ambulance, being led away, I'm like, happy.  Because, like, now everybody knows.  It's like the UN's gotta come in with blue helmets.  Everybody knows now that she's-  And they keep the peace.  Fucking crazy.  She's nuts.  It's been proven.  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  There's no one that will blame me for not going back to that house.  This is fucking beyond me.  The closest I could even come to anything like this is if you have a dream, which is more  than just having this daydream type thing.  Right.  It's, like, got a little more viscosity to it, you know? 
[02:43:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  You, like, you got a little more to grab onto when it's a dream.  Right.  And then you wake up for the dream.  And for a very short time where you're still in that groggy period, you look over and go,  you fuck.  You fucking do that to me?  Yeah.  And it's, but it doesn't manifest into this fucking grudge that you hold onto and a little  piece of it.  It's, I have to still be in that sleep awake portion of, but that's, that's about as close 
[02:43:30]  as I can get to what you guys are talking about.  The only good thing is I do, um, I do get over it.  Like where I was, I would hold onto this shit for a long time with people.  Um, cause I'm, again, I'm really nuts with some of this shit, but like with last time  this happened, um, it was like, like we actually went home and like, and she's like, what's  wrong with you?  And I'm like, I did like, I was like by the end of the night, but by an hour later we were  like kissing and everything was good.  We had sex.  It was great.  Like, as opposed to it being a week long, it's like, I give myself credit.  Like it's improving vastly. 
[02:44:00]  You're getting better.  Cause we communicate a lot.  And it's like, I know it's me.  She, she's done nothing wrong.  She's not a perfect girl, but she doesn't cheat.  She doesn't fuck it.  None of it.  It's just, I'm trying to find something to fucking wreck it.  But you're, again, you're not, you're not just doing, you're  going, you're thinking about it.  You're making up shit.  Yeah.  We got another wrinkle from Charlie in Philly.  Charlie, what's up?  What's up?  Obi, Andy, Jimmy and Louie.  What's up guys?  Hey man, you forgot fan, but go right ahead.  Selfish.  Oh, sorry.  Uh, Jimmy.  Yes.  Uh, I've been married 21 years and I go through all these scenarios with my wife and talk to 
[02:44:30]  her.  Maybe it subconsciously, it turns you on and it actually makes you set a goal to be better  than the other guy.  I do it to a point where I get so turned on and enraged at the same time.  And I hate fuck the shit out of her and just leave her laying there like a corpse on the  bed.  But it's awesome.  It feels so good.  So there's, for me, there's a balance between that stuff.  Like there's a, there's a place where I could find my girlfriend being sexual with another  person in theory and in talk to be very sexy because I'm attracted to her physically. 
[02:45:00]  So to see, I mean, I'm a perv.  So to see it, you know, to think of my girl fucking, I got a tennis dick.  Do I want to see that?  Never.  To think about it, like just to see her being dirty.  Yeah.  I can fantasize.  But then there's the little invisible line I cross and it's like, am I doing this because  I'm in a silly perv mood right now?  Or am I trying to hurt and degrade myself and put myself in a place that I'll never come  back from?  Like I don't, I, there's, there's a weird thing I do with that.  Like there's sometimes where I'm doing it because it's like, baby, you're very sexy.  I just want to picture you fucking sucking a guy's dick while I'm fucking you because  you're dirty. 
[02:45:30]  I want to picture you eating another girl.  Like that's the way my mind is working.  And then there's other times where I'm like, okay, let's get to the reality is you want  to fuck a guy with a bigger dick.  Here's a sledgehammer, hit me with it and I'll never recover.  Like there's a line there and I don't know why I'm doing things half the time.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wow.  That's what I'm talking about.  Where does this shit come from?  I don't know.  Could it be the little girl who left when I was a baby?  I don't know.  It's just coming from the evil dick.  Yeah.  Evil dick.  I hate my dick.  I'd love to fucking cut it off and throw it in the dustbin.  I saw it in an episode.  You should.  I'd like to put it in the fucking ass pan. 
[02:46:00]  We go to Arizona.  What?  We go to Arizona for the answer.  It's Lindsay.  Lindsay, what's up?  Morning, boys.  Good morning.  We're trying to help little Jimmy today.  I know.  He sounds so sad.  I feel so bad for him.  I'm really not.  I'd be honest with you, Lindsay.  I'm really not sad.  I'm just, I don't understand what the fuck is wrong with me.  You know, Jim, it might have something to do with monster rain.  I'm just going to throw it out there because, you know, I've talked about it on the show  before.  With what?  Monster rain.  That whole time for me.  I mean, talk about it.  I've never heard about that. 
[02:46:30]  Monster rain?  Talk about it in therapy, the monster rain?  Well, the whole time, because again, my first, I have a pain love association.  I talk about it on stage.  My first, when I used to fantasize about Kiss when I was a kid, and again, they weren't  sexual.  My real fantasy about the group Kiss would be, because I worshipped them, that they would  come over.  By the way, this is hysterical.  Have you ever heard this, Luke?  I've never heard, no.  Oh, boy.  But the tragic truth.  Strap in, man.  But they would, but it's not, it's just, it's not even that weird.  My fantasy was, kid, is that Kiss would come over and they would beat me, and they would  hurt me badly and throw me down a flight of steps. 
[02:47:00]  And then when I was at the bottom, devastated and crying, they would come down and hug me  and love me and make it all better.  And I remembered, all through my life, my fantasies of relationships have been, like in high school,  ways to fantasize, that a girl would see me being beaten, like in bludgeoned by people  and bloody and somehow surviving it.  Like, I had these, yeah, go ahead.  Is that normal?  I mean, like S&M, a lot of times seems like it's about the curing.  No, no, not sexual. 
[02:47:30]  Nothing sexual.  Like being beat up by guys just beating you.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, but no.  And she would come over and.  Love me.  It's not about sex.  It wasn't an S&M thing.  You want to be healed, but you want to.  Yeah, that's true.  It's not a gay thing.  I wouldn't fantasize that men would hurt me and turn me on.  The pain and fucking tragedy and just fucking awfulness first before the, like, love and  shit.  You know, I.  That means somebody in his past did something.  That's the first love that you felt was something that came after something terrible  happened to you.  Probably. 
[02:48:00]  Somebody hurt you and somebody else hugged you, and you've never felt comfort like that.  Probably.  The doctor went to smack him when he came out of the womb, and a finger slipped right up  his asshole.  First, right out first breath, he got a finger up his ass.  You were violated.  You were really scared by the violation, and then this person made it good by hugging  you and going, it's okay.  I was at a dentist once.  I have a huge dental phobia.  Like, if I need, like, to get intravenous fucking knockout drugs to just get my teeth 
[02:48:30]  cleaned.  It's really bad.  But this guy, yeah, I'm fine.  I, one time I had a tooth removed, and the guy, yeah, it was horrible, and tons of blood.  It was so painful.  And then afterwards, the dentist came up to me and put his hand around, like, his arm  around me and said, you okay, buddy?  And, like, he gave me some kind of drug to make me feel better, and I kind of wanted to  kiss him, like, on the mouth.  Like, I had a love for this man, because he hurt me, and then he made me feel better.  And I wanted him to fuck my face.  It is the fucking terrorist hostage situation. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Don't know why.  Where, after a long time, you build up a relationship with these people, even though they are the  ones that are putting you in the Stockholm Syndrome is cold.  Yes.  Yep.  Let's go to Toledo and say hi to Jason.  Jason.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey.  Hey, my wife is just like Jimmy.  She just makes up a scenario.  She's a small cock, and she doesn't make anybody come either?  No, sometimes.  I love you, too.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry. 
[02:49:30]  Sorry.  Go ahead.  No, no.  You, buddy.  She dreams these things up, that I'm fucking a neighbor, and then she wakes up, she holds  it against me.  So now, every time we're around the neighbors, I'm uncomfortable as hell.  I don't know what to do.  So, you know, she does that all the time.  She thinks I'm fucking my cousin's wife.  See, I tend to do this.  The last time I did this type of stuff was probably eight, ten years ago.  It was with the last girl I was with.  I loved Erin when I was dating her, but I wasn't in love with her, because I didn't 
[02:50:00]  date her as long.  I didn't know her as long as I know this girl.  I loved her.  But this girl I know for years, so I'm in love with her, too.  I, for some reason, didn't do this with Erin, even though I did love her.  I don't know why.  But I was, last time I did this was for real, was like the last long-term relationship I  had, which was like ten years ago, where I was in love with a girl, and I would always  try to fucking find out about her ex-boyfriend.  Here's the thing with dick size.  I'm fine.  My dick is fine.  But that's something that is unchangeable. 
[02:50:30]  Like, that's why I'll focus on that.  Like, because I know mentally I'm a pervert.  Like, if you want to be spanked, your hair, I know I can do that, and I know that most  things another guy did to you mentally, I can do.  That's something that I can kind of handle, and I'm comfortable with that, because my mind  works well.  But cock size is an unchangeable absolute.  So if that's got me beat, that's something I can hurt myself with, and I can never change.  I can never, ever fix it for as long as I live.  It actually takes some consolation in that, because it is so absolute and unchangeable 
[02:51:00]  that there is nothing you can do about it, so that should make it that much easier to  move on from.  Do you like your cock?  Yes, it's fine.  What?  You like it.  Yeah, I like it.  You know, I called yesterday in the airport.  I was so bummed out.  I called fucking...  I called...  Oh my...  I was...  I have to burp like that.  I love burping that way.  It's a lizard burp.  It just stuck out.  That's a good one, bud.  Get that for our machine.  It's like a shark burp.  That's a good one. 
[02:51:30]  I called Patrice yesterday, because Patrice and I have the same type of fucking lunacy,  and he was good to talk to, because he certainly relates to all the fuck.  I know he's a disgusting perv, and I also know that he's a vulnerable, weak, frightened  nothing.  Yeah.  You know, he's a combination, which is nice.  And we talked about it.  He's also black.  I forget that.  Whenever I'm asking for advice, I just never look at his color, or I won't take the advice  seriously.  But no, no, he made some good sound.  We had a nice chat yesterday.  See, there are going to be bigger dicks.  No, no, no, no.  And there are going to be smaller dicks.  Yes. 
[02:52:00]  And whatever girl you're with, perhaps, if you inquire, will have been with smaller  and or bigger dicks.  Well, I was bugging her one day about it, and I think she was annoyed at me.  And she said, she didn't know what to say.  She's like, well, I've definitely fucked guys with bigger dicks.  Like, did you have to, I kind of laughed, like, phrasing, baby.  Phrasing is very important.  The word definitely was not as good.  It's almost like, hey, goose, I've been protecting you from this info.  Right.  But you're not fucking dressing yourself up in a deer suit.  I know.  Handing a rifle to a hunter.  And then when he shoots you, you go, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. 
[02:52:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  No, I'm Harry Whittington, and Dick Cheney shot me, and I'm a little surprised.  There's a difference.  I was hunting, but I wasn't going to do TV.  I was going to do TV and apologize that you were shot.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.  What, sweetie?  Asking for it.  Did you get a lot of love after your suicide attempt?  Oh.  That's coming in, and I kind of like that thought there.  I will say yes and no.  It was more embarrassment, but this had been going on long before then.  When the fuck did you try to kill yourself?  When I was drinking and stuff like that.  Really?  It was more just slight.  Yeah, more slight stuff. 
[02:53:00]  Faggot.  I know.  It was all nonsense.  Why don't you do it, you fucking...  Believe me, you're preaching to the choir.  I fucking...  You think I don't realize I shit had a gun?  I fucking...  But did you get a lot of love after the suicide attempt that you weren't getting beforehand?  Like, God.  I would say not really, no, because I was more embarrassed by the whole thing, so I didn't  want the...  I was like, ugh, because I sobered up.  I was in rehab.  I felt like a douche.  Sure.  That was part of the reason I did it, was to get that feeling.  But again, it goes way before that.  I didn't learn anything from that.  That was a behavior trying to recapture something I'd learned earlier, if that makes any sense, 
[02:53:30]  like that suffering.  And I just had a thought, too, about the...  Oh, I just want to tell my girlfriend, because she's like,  I don't know why you think about this.  She's like, this is so much in your head.  This is not something I...  She's like, well, I'm not having sex with you thinking I wish you had a bigger dick.  I'm happy.  I like having sex.  And I know she's being truthful.  Because it's just the way that you quoted her phrasing, well, okay, I've definitely had  bigger dicks.  It was almost a reservation.  You are, like, forcing her to say that.  I know.  You want to hear that come out of her mouth, so that you can say, you see, you think my 
[02:54:00]  dick's too small.  I'm going to go over here and jack off to something else.  If it's a fact, then it's not honest to say it.  Like, I said to her, like, let's say that we were dating, and you knew that my history  was, my favorite thing to do was titty fuck girls.  And I only, like, all the girls I dated, or a couple of girls that had double D tits,  and my thing was titty fucking.  I love that.  Let's say you had a breast, which she doesn't, but I'm like, no matter how much I loved you,  you have a breast.  Like, I want to titty fuck you, I'm attracted to you, but I love you, you're great, but 
[02:54:30]  I cannot make that happen because your tits aren't what I need for that.  Yeah, you're trying out really hard.  You're like a lawyer against...  But that's not that big of a stretch, though.  Yeah, but see, you're working so hard to find a way to hate your own dick.  I'm actually, but I am, in a way, working hard to explain it to somebody who thinks it's  crazy.  I could get your explanation, but is the act of titty fucking more important than everything  else in your relationship?  No.  If it is, then leave the fucking relationship.  No.  If it isn't, then just fucking deal with it and move on. 
[02:55:00]  No, but if she said to me one day, you would like sex better if my tits were bigger, I couldn't  deny it and say she was wrong.  Maybe, okay, no.  You could say, I fucked bigger tits.  I could, but then the fact would be, I like girls with bigger tits.  So when I said that to her, it's almost like if that's required for you, if you really  like that, even though you love me and stuff, if I can't give you that, you'll still love  fucking me, but there will always be that little asterisk.  The titty fuck thing is not that crazy of an example, but no, no, it's not. 
[02:55:30]  It's not.  But you're never going to find the perfect everything.  Well, the thing is, you're working in the wrong direction.  You're working really hard to just, you know, to say I don't deserve this.  You should let the girl fuck somebody who just enjoys the fuck, comes on her ass and  goes home instead of this silliness.  And think of how big your dick looks in between small tits.  Problem solved.  Small dick, small tits look.  But do you understand?  I don't have a small dick.  My dick's fine.  Hey, Jimmy.  Jimmy, don't worry. 
[02:56:00]  I'm not criticizing your talk.  I've seen it.  It's beautiful.  No, I mean, I'm not feeling sorry for myself.  What I'm saying is, like, I don't want my dick to be fine.  I don't want to be mediocre with my dick.  This is what me and Patrice talked about.  And the way he phrased it, and he was just perfect, was something about he wants his dick  to be undeniably big.  Like, no matter what country you're in, if a girl sees your dick, she knows it's big.  Like the speed of light, like not even relative to anything else.  His dick is so big.  Undeniably big.  So anyone seeing it would go, that's a big dick. 
[02:56:30]  Like, where it's not so subjective as compared to who they've fucked before.  Right.  Like, even a girl that's fucked big dicks.  And that was a great point he raised yesterday.  It was very funny.  And he made me laugh in an airport waiting for my luggage, which, that's how funny he  is.  You know, I laugh waiting for my luggage.  Better than him stomping on it.  Always appropriate.  Always.  So that was his, he made a very good point.  But that's what I want.  And, uh, wow.  She told me my dick was nice, and I guess that just bothered me.  It's almost like, she goes, your dick is nice. 
[02:57:00]  She's a woman.  She's not a guy.  She's not going to say, dude, your dick is fucking awesome.  That could be said like, like, god damn, you have a nice ass.  Like, when you say that to a girl, it doesn't mean, yeah, your ass is nice.  That means that's a great fucking ass.  You've got a nice, gorgeous girlfriend who thinks your dick is nice, and you're trying  to find negative.  You don't think you deserve it.  You don't think you deserve it.  Self-sabotage.  I know, I can't disagree.  Wow.  But there's also a little bit of validity in what I'm saying, mixed in with it, which  is what makes it hard for me to let it go. 
[02:57:30]  No, there's none.  I'm partially correct.  Only if you're like a lawyer against yourself.  I am.  You're like, you're a genius at fucking yourself out of a great situation.  I know, I'm Johnny Cox-sized.  A lot of people say it has to go back to your childhood.  You should fucking join Al-Qaeda.  You'd make a great suicide bomber.  Yep.  You just would fucking, fuck this, fuck everyone.  I'm just going to fucking blow myself up and other people that think my cock is small.  Well, it's kind of a hack bit, but we should get him hypnotized on the show.  I wouldn't be able to.  I was hypnotized once when I went to therapy when I was like 19 or 20 or 22. 
[02:58:00]  I think I just got started.  Did it work?  They did it in front of a class because I didn't have much money.  Yeah.  Not really.  I'm not easy to hypnotize.  I've tried it and it's very hard to get me done.  All right, let's go to Lucas.  Lucas, what's up?  Hey.  First off, I love you guys.  You love the show.  Bummed about Lucky Louie, but as soon as the stores open up to get my copy of the DVD.  Nice.  Thank you.  I've got to tell you, I'm such a dope.  I went through the same kind of thing.  I built something up in my head so much that I got myself physically ill. 
[02:58:30]  I threw up.  I called a girlfriend from work one time and the number was blocked.  And I'm such an idiot that once I called, she answered the phone.  Hey, Mike, how's it going?  And I'm like, wait a minute.  And I just such an idiot.  I hang up.  I get myself all worked up thinking, oh, my God, she's seeing somebody else.  Who's this Mike guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Everything.  And I'm in the bathroom just dry even. 
[02:59:00]  I've dumped everything out of my stomach.  I'm sick to my stomach thinking about this.  I've got to leave work.  I go tell my boss, look, I've got to go.  I'm sick.  I don't feel good.  I'm not going to tell him the real story.  Your boss is, what's the matter, Mike?  I'm sick.  Yeah.  I'm sick.  And you realize that was your name.  You realize, oh, my God, my name is Mike.  Fucking Mike.  What's wrong with me?  Go ahead, Mike.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Mike.  I didn't know it was going to be a hit, Mike.  So I'm in the car driving home. 
[02:59:30]  And, oh, God, this is killing me.  I don't, I, I, I, I.  And we get it.  You're aggravated.  Yes.  Move to the punchline.  And that's when, that's when I realized her brother is Mike.  Oh, all right.  Her brother is Mike.  And I'm such a, oh.  She's fucking her brother.  She's our brother.  She's fucking her brother.  That is disgusting.  Gross.  But I got myself all worked up over it.  Yeah, wow.  Yeah, the only thing I can say.  How many lights did you hit on the way home?  Holy fuck.  I say in my own favor. 
[03:00:00]  It's weird.  When I was in Sacramento, I said this on the air before that my girlfriend's family came  to see me and didn't tell me.  Oh, no.  Her aunt, her uncle, and her grandmother came to my show.  And they left without saying hi, you mean?  Yeah.  And the reason they did, it was not to be rude.  They loved the show.  She goes, they didn't want to feel like they were intruding because you didn't know they  were coming.  They're like, oh, he didn't want to meet us, that he was talking to people.  They just kind of felt like they didn't want to be imprusive.  So how did you take that?  Exactly like that.  They saw my bulge and laugh and walk home.  I can't even talk to a guy with that tiny thing.  Oh, God. 
[03:00:30]  He has Ken doll genitals.  No, no, no, no.  I was kind of glad I'm not doing anything shitty.  Oh, my God.  I wasn't panicking.  What did they say?  It was like, oh, why did they come up and say hello?  I was actually kind of annoyed.  I wish they would have come up and said hi.  So I'm not as fucking nuts as I used to be, and I do kind of figure this shit out.  But why do I do that stuff?  I think you're working on it in a very healthy way, Jimmy.  It is.  I really think like the fact that you're talking to her about it is huge.  And here's the thing, Jim, what I would say.  Like your cock is huge.  This thing you're doing, it is part of you. 
[03:01:00]  It's not like you can't change what you're like.  If something happened to you when you were a kid that makes you do this when good things happen,  it's just part of you.  It's not wrong.  And if she's listening to it and taking it and she still loves you, then you guys will be all right.  And you'll always have that in your relationship that you'll keep going.  Yeah, but if a black guy came in here, gave you $2 million, would you kiss his dick and then call me an asshole?  Well, technically, yes, I would, Jim.  But fucking bitch.  You hate me.  But she's never done anything that indicated to me she wasn't happy. 
[03:01:30]  Like she doesn't do that.  It's not like I'm picking up.  I ask her enough questions until I get what I'm looking for, which is that feeling.  It happens right below your neck.  It starts like in your throat and stops above your pubic.  It's a thickness.  It's a heaviness.  My therapist told me that you're so sad.  It's like sadness.  No, no, no.  It's not anxiety.  But it can be.  It's like that feeling.  Like it's just it's sadness.  It's like you have a weight.  Do you know of the feeling you get when someone dies that, you know, it's a it's a tangible feeling. 
[03:02:00]  Yes.  It's more than just an emotion.  It's a physical like feeling.  You're feeling this.  Especially when they die in front of you with your cum on their face.  Right.  Last words.  And you don't have to pay small cock.  What'd you do to me?  And you don't have to pay her.  But it's that type of like physical feeling.  Yeah.  Do you know what my therapist told me?  And I just started like a month ago.  I'm so glad I went back. 
[03:02:30]  Again, it was inspired by my girlfriend.  I started to go because we were talking one time.  She goes, why?  I feel like you're always mad at me.  Like, what the fuck?  Why?  Who said that?  My girlfriend did.  I thought you said you were a therapist.  No, no.  I had this anger.  I had this fucking anger.  Why are you mad at me?  It was so long, man.  It was fucking.  The anger was wrecking my spine.  You've been holding your feelings back.  Why are you?  Dr. Meltzer.  Don't fucking, uh...  My therapist told me, oh, you're just trying to feel something.  Because I live in a fantasy world, man.  I never realized how much I fantasize.  And so I'll hang out with my girlfriend. 
[03:03:00]  And I will actually mime a conversation to myself in my head with her right there about  what I'm going to have with her.  And she catches me moving my lips.  Holy shit.  Dude, fucking Bob Kelly yelled at me one time.  Oh, my God.  What the fuck are you doing?  You're nuts.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  He goes, you're fucking talking to yourself.  You're with me.  Oh, my God.  And he was right.  And I told her that.  And she loves fat Bob for doing that.  That's a bad example.  I'd rather talk to myself than to Bob.  Of course.  Yeah.  But I'll fantasize that I'm talking to my girlfriend about something while she's sitting 
[03:03:30]  right there.  And she caught me again yesterday.  I'm too embarrassed to admit what it is.  It's fucking fascinating.  You can't face reality, which is she's sitting there and she's there for you.  I want to dissect him.  You're making another situation inside the same room where she's fucking with you and  you don't deserve it.  My therapist said you just want to feel something.  It really is amazing.  That's amazing.  But you want to feel something.  There's plenty to feel.  You've got a great girlfriend.  But you're not feeling happiness or love and fucking excitement. 
[03:04:00]  But the fact that you're suffering this shit might mean you're working through it.  It's like people that say pain is the feeling of weakness leading your body.  Pain is the touchstone of all spiritual progress.  That's not what I said.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I was trying to make it sound like a dummy didn't say it.  What did you say?  You know, pain equals joy eventually.  No, no.  My fucking therapist said to me, what did she say, man?  She said, die of age.  That's a small dick fucking point. 
[03:04:30]  Worst patient I ever had.  No, we were talking.  Really, doctor?  Is that your prognosis?  Oh, shit.  No, my therapist said to me, she goes, as I'm talking to you, I have no sense of who you  are.  Wow.  And I'm like, what do you mean?  She sucks.  But no, no, she's really sharp.  She's like, I'm listening to you talk.  And I'm telling her the truth.  I have no sense of what makes you tick.  It's almost like the sexual stuff is so distracting. 
[03:05:00]  And I use it to constantly distract and focus away from myself.  It's fucking lunacy, man.  I'm trying to figure out if I know Jimmy, now that you've said that.  I don't know.  Like the therapist, it's only been a couple of weeks, right?  So it would kind of be hard to, you know, figure out a person in a couple of weeks.  But now I'm trying to figure if I, like, know you more than just we sit here and do  a show and then, you know, an occasional phone call and stuff.  Do I really, like, know what you're all about?  And I don't really think I do.  No.  Because it is a lot of the, like, that bizarre sexual behavior and this weird thing that you're 
[03:05:30]  talking about now with the relationships and stuff.  So it's like, I got to get to know you a little better.  I'm a good guy.  You like Starbucks coffee.  I do.  I do.  That's what I know.  You like black Sabbath.  I know the way you take this guy.  I know he's a Sabbath and stuff.  You know facts.  But this is more that I've learned more about you during this one little conversation than  all the years I've known you.  Well, yeah.  Because it's giving a little more insight into who you are. 
[03:06:00]  He likes warm dubs on his chest.  No, no, no.  Never a warm one.  It's always a solid.  It's going to be a nugget.  Boy, I'm not going to go any farther than this detail.  I'm very optimistic for you, Jimmy.  I did remember recently when I was very, very young that I was smelling somebody's shit  in an abandoned house.  Somebody taking a shit.  This is it.  This is it.  There is this one thing that's unbelievably...  I have a very vague, weird memory of leaning over and smelling somebody. 
[03:06:30]  I mean, again, I was as young as you can be because I remember the abandoned house in  Edison.  We used to hang out in where I found my first pornographic pictures.  And I just remembered to the day smelling somebody's shit.  It might have been my own.  I honest to God don't remember if it was mine or somebody else.  One of my earliest memories.  Dude, I don't know.  It was on a giant cock.  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't remember.  It wasn't sexual and I didn't see anybody's shit.  I don't remember. 
[03:07:00]  But this is an actual event that happened?  Yeah.  I just remember smelling it.  Oh, wow.  And not like an animal in a weird way.  I don't know why I did it or what it did for me.  One of my earliest memories was being in Mexico City at my grandmother's house.  And it's a huge Christmas dinner and I'm in the bathroom.  So there's just voices of like 20, 30 people in the other room.  And I thought that, you know, I was a little boy.  I thought boys pee standing up and poop sitting down.  So I'm pissing and I have to shit too.  And I'm standing there and I just shit on the floor. 
[03:07:30]  And so instead of, I got to clean it up, but instead of like picking, taking toilet paper  and I'm like picking up your shit, I'm going to try to wipe it up.  So I just smear it fucking all over the floor and the wall.  Fucking stupid kids.  I'm like a fucking Irish like famine, you know, guy.  Fucking hunger strike dude.  Just shit all over my face.  All over the toilet and the walls.  And then my uncle walked in and said, oh my God.  Jerked off on you.  My memory is that he washed my hands and said, I'll take care of this and let me alone. 
[03:08:00]  But part of me wonders if one day that's going to snap into what really happened, which is  he rubbed his dick in the shit and made me suck it off or whatever.  You've covered it into this, you were shitting, they were outside thing.  Yeah, exactly.  There were times you figure you got to think, you're like, wait a minute, am I remembering  this accurately?  Yeah.  Like, I was young, this, that, ah.  Am I editing out many fuck-mouth fucks?  Yeah, what the fuck?  That's following the story.  All right, hey, Jessica has a question before we take a break here. 
[03:08:30]  Jessica, go ahead.  Let's scare Jessica to death.  Hey, what is going on?  Jimmy was supposed to be at the DC Improv and I just found out the show's been canceled.  I'm terribly, terribly upset.  Canceled.  They got a comic with a bigger dick.  Yeah, exactly.  They just got yesterday to re-find my ticket.  No, what's happening, sweetheart, I'll be honest, is, um,  it looked, I'm shooting, um, an hour HBO special.  I don't know exactly when it's going to be or where, but I am, it may not happen there,  but I am fighting to have it done in Washington, D.C. 
[03:09:00]  D.C., D.C., D.C., Jimmy.  And that was why the improv was canceled.  You're canceling yourself.  Yes, for the special.  I'm fighting to do it in D.C.  You are, Jessica?  I feel wonderful inside.  But that's why.  Warm and fuzzy.  We couldn't leave the DC Improv hanging until the week of, so we have, again, I may not even  be able to do that, but it looks like, oh, but that's what we're pushing for.  We couldn't wait anymore.  Don't break my heart.  Thank you, sweetheart.  All right, Jessica.  Bye.  Why don't we take a break and get into some other things?  Do we help you?  Yeah, I mean, I just, I don't know.  Or just talking out, help yourself. 
[03:09:30]  I don't know.  It's like, I don't know if it helped or hurt.  It's the truth, though.  It's just what it is.  Jimmy's happier lately.  I am much happier.  That's another thing I know about Jimmy.  Much happier.  Much.  Yeah.  I feel much better, but my act is improving.  So get rid of that happiness.  No, I can't.  What are you doing with it?  It makes me act better, because I was fucking going to just obsessively work yesterday.  It's the last gas battle of this shit cunts inside of your body.  Yeah.  You're right.  That's all it is.  It makes you act better.  Do you have like a big foamy Muppet puppet now that you use up there?  Yeah.  His name is Saddy. 
[03:10:00]  Saddy.  Saddy.  Get us out of here.  The Norton and Faggot Show.  That's what we should call it, program.  I know how to handle cock.  All my cocks got in.  iPods.  Corn on the cob.  Smoothies.  Egg white omelets.  Bagels and seltzer.  Starbucks apple cake.  Absolutely.  And rollerblading.  White cocks.  Black cocks. 
[03:10:30]  Two fruits.  Two fruits.  I know.  How to handle cock.  Not only do I know how to handle cocks, I love doing it.  Over here, Anthony.  All right.  Louis C.K. in studio.  Lucky Louis on DVD. 
[03:11:00]  Today, you can buy it in stores.  Oh, yeah.  We got the E-Rock and Bill UFC bet.  Ooh.  Loser gets a Brazilian wax.  That's an ass waxing.  A Brazilian wax live in the air.  And the winner gets $500.  E-Rock and Wild Bill will bet on Anderson the Spider Silva.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring.  Banana pool.  What are you using, Stingray?  Windows 95?  Now I got to take abuse from the PalTalk people.  I wouldn't get Vista. 
[03:11:30]  You couldn't pay me to use Vista.  What are you, one of those Windows 95 guys that call a tech and go, I don't know, it keeps  crashing.  How about you upgrade?  Yep.  What's wrong?  People, they said the same thing about fucking XP.  Yes.  Windows.  It's buggy.  It's fucking buggy.  I'm going to be patching the shit out of it.  There's going to be crashes.  There's going to be, things will happen.  But you have to move to the next operating system.  It's the only way these fucking computers stay up to date.  These tech guys, ask any tech guy that works for a company.  All right.  They fucking hate it because they go in and people are still running fucking 98, Windows 
[03:12:00]  98, and they go, I'm having a problem with this.  It's like, fucking upgrade, you dumb shit.  What's wrong with Vista?  Oh, it's fucking brand new, dude.  You're going to have all kinds of shit.  All sorts of bugs.  If I have shit, I'm not putting it on every machine, first of all.  And I'm going to see.  And if patches come out, then I'll fucking put the patches.  At some point, you're going to have to upgrade, and you sit there for 18 hours while  every patch for two years fucking has to download.  All right.  Let's go with this.  Oh, I hate people.  We got to get this.  This is awful. 
[03:12:30]  We got to get this bet out of the way.  So we got E-Rock, and we got Bill.  And then next week, I'll be going, fucking Vista.  I want to return.  I got to fucking get fucked everything up.  We got to get this bet out of the way.  So the loser gets a Brazilian wax, and the winner gets $500.  They're betting it's Anderson the Spider Silva versus Travis Lutter this Saturday, February  3rd on Pay-Per-View.  Also on the card, Quentin Rampage Jackson versus Marvin the Beastman Eastman, and the UFC  debut of international superstar, Mirko.  He's fighting.  When is this? 
[03:13:00]  Cro-Cop.  When is this?  This Saturday, February 3rd on Pay-Pay-Per-View.  This Saturday, February 3rd.  I unfortunately will be in Houston.  Mirko Cro-Cop.  I have been fucking obsessed with since dumb Rogan talked about him.  Oh, yeah.  I don't put that in my head.  Now he's all I want to watch.  And the first Cro-Cop.  But now that you're doing more besides having sex, it's, dude.  You know, you got these things to look forward to, Jimmy.  Let me tell you something about fucking Mirko Cro-Cop.  Rogan was right.  This guy is going to fucking beat everybody in the UFC.  Really?  He is a machine. 
[03:13:30]  I watched the first clip I saw of him.  He got knocked out.  Like, he got beat up badly.  Well, he does sound like a contender.  That's what I'm like.  This guy's not that great.  You're really talking him up there, Jimmy.  You really got an eye of the talent.  These guys all are so good, these fighters, that like any of them, if you make one critical  error, it's like a chess player.  One great chess player can lose to another one.  You're right.  That is.  It's not like boxing where there's this dominant guy that comes in.  The dominant guy can just get one punch.  Boom.  He's fucking on the ground. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, because these guys, if you make one technical error, they arm bar you or they  knock you out.  And the second time Cro-Cop fought the guy, he choked the guy out in like the first round.  So I watched a bunch of Mirko Cro-Cop.  Cro-Cop, I think, is short for Croatian Cop.  His real name is like a lot of pick or some shit.  He is fucking devastating.  And I was worried about Liddell because I love Liddell.  I like him on a personal level, but I'm like, Jesus, can Liddell beat this guy?  But they're in different weight classes.  They probably won't have to fight.  All right, really?  This Saturday on pay-per-view.  We'll see what happens.  Cro-Cop, watch fucking just for Cro-Cop. 
[03:14:30]  This guy is devastating.  He's devastating.  All right, how is this bet getting...  How are we doing this thing?  Iraq, you get...  I don't care as long as Iraq gets fucking waxed up his asshole and all the hair ripped out.  Absolutely.  I'll put it on with my dick if you want, Eric.  For old time's sake.  For old time's sake.  I'll hide it behind your ass.  Well, I know nothing about UFC, and apparently I don't get the first pick on the bet either.  All right, how was that decided?  Popular demand? 
[03:15:00]  Why is Sam happy?  Sam is happy at the prospect of Iraq's being ready.  Anytime Iraq's in here, Sam's happy.  He's just smiling.  Because he knows he'll be degraded in some way.  He sucks about the videos of Iraq.  They're all shaky because Sam is just laughing.  Sam's laughing.  He's just trying to film.  Yeah.  Looks like Iraq's in an earthquake every time his video...  Yeah.  Looks like Hepburn's home movies in the last five years.  So Bill gets to pick?  Yes.  Who's heavily favored?  I'm picking Silva.  Why?  Because he beat the shit out of Rich Franklin, who was three years reigning champion. 
[03:15:30]  And he's from Pride, and all the Pride fighters are better than the UFC, and they're all coming here now.  Yeah, but what is Pride?  What is Pride, Bill?  Pride is the Japanese version of the UFC, but it's more international.  Where's Krokop from?  He came from Pride to UFC.  Krokop's probably the second best fighter in all of mixed martial arts.  The best fighter in mixed martial arts is in Pride.  His name is Fedor.  And he's still in Pride for now.  Okay, that's the Japanese one.  Now, Fedor is what nationality?  Russian.  He's better than Krokop?  Yep, he beat the crap out of Krokop. 
[03:16:00]  You are so done, Iraq.  He really knows his fucking UFC.  All right, Iraq, what do you know about UFC?  Not a thing.  There's got to be something.  Chuck Liddell was in the studio.  That's all I know.  Oh, no.  What a fucking girl.  Oh, boy.  But then you're going to make a bet where you get your ass waxed if you lose?  I was pretty much told you're in this bet, and Bill gets first pick.  Why don't you just have your ass waxed?  Yeah.  I mean, you should wax it the day of, so that when you lose and pull your pants down, people 
[03:16:30]  will go like, it's already fucking waxed.  That's right.  What you want to do is take a disgusting shit and not wipe that good.  You don't have a waxed.  You just have to smell your fucking reeking crack.  Oh, just waxes off a big fucking brownie.  All right.  It's pronounced Travis Luder.  I don't know this shit either.  So you get Travis Luder?  I guess so.  And Bill gets Anderson the Spider.  This guy's name is Travis.  What kind of a man could he possibly be?  Exactly.  He hits the guy with a purse like Ruth Buzzy. 
[03:17:00]  Thank you, Mr. Torrance.  All right.  So the bet's in.  We'll see who wins.  And what?  Are we doing the waxing on Monday?  Okay.  The Brazilian wax will happen on Monday's show.  Ooh, can't wait.  Hey, Bill.  Who in UFC is going to beat fucking Crow Cop?  No one.  Absolutely no one.  And the heavyweight division of UFC is not that strong.  They got that guy, Sylvia, and he just really sucks.  Hey, can I get some Crow Cop video on demand?  Go to YouTube.  Go to YouTube.  I watch a bunch of it. 
[03:17:30]  Fucking.  The guy.  All right, cool.  He's fucking.  His feet are awful.  Really?  You've never seen any.  I mean, you have karate guys, but his feet are.  He's fucking.  And he's devastating.  Wow.  He's a devastating man.  I watch that shit, like, with a love-hate thing going on, because I love to watch it  and the action, but it's so painful to watch.  You're like, how could, oh my God, that's a human being, and he's elbowing his fucking  nose in.  Like, I think Crow Cop would beat a guy.  Who's a really tough?  Who's the tough guy?  Chuck Zito. 
[03:18:00]  Chuck Zito from the Hell's Angle.  Yeah.  He's a tough fucking dude.  Mm-hmm.  And I think Crow Cop would make short work of a guy.  Like, that's the level of fighter he's on.  Like, a guy like Chuck Zito, I look at, and I go, it's incomprehensible to have  to fight that animal.  Right.  But a guy like Crow Cop is in a different world than he is.  Like, not that he would beat him as easily as Zito would beat me, but, like, to look  at a man like Chuck Zito and have no fear of him, and to know that you could, like, that's  the fucking type of guy he is.  That's where he is.  It's a world you can't comprehend.  Like, a guy like Crow Cop, he would smash Mike Tyson in a real... 
[03:18:30]  What's his big move?  Kick?  His feet, everything.  He can box, he can wrestle.  I mean, he's a fucking mixed martial arts fighter.  But his feet, Crow Cop's feet, are devastated.  Because he gets really close to you, and all of a sudden, there's a foot in your face.  He likes...  I love that shit.  He prefers to kick you with bare feet.  That's his problem solving, is to take his foot and to barefoot plant it into your forehead.  Oh, so he could do that thing where you're boxing, so you're close enough to be boxing, 
[03:19:00]  and then that foot comes up like a clock, like the big hand on a clock.  Oh, I've seen that.  It's unbelievable.  How about somebody comes in here and just looks him up on YouTube?  Yeah, let's do that.  Let's say hi to Don in Indiana.  Hi, Don.  As they get the video ready.  What's up, Don?  Hey.  Get Don on the phone.  Hey, I got a poem for you.  From the Princeton house in New Jersey?  No, I'm from Indiana.  Hold on a second.  Let me bomb, sir. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  Hey, are you guys there?  Yeah, let's go, Don.  Speak.  I had to get outside because I was in an office in New York, so they couldn't hear this poem.  Oh, I was wondering.  So, I'm out of breath, too.  I was running outside.  Oh, God.  I hope you're okay.  I hope you're going to be all right.  Take your time, Blake.  What else is going on?  I hate to have this call end abruptly.  How's your heart rate from your mother's cunt?  Hold on, sir.  I'm thinking about your cholesterol.  Hey, listen to this poem.  I wrote this poem about my ex-wife.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  All right.  Listen.  Okay.  Thanks, Jerry.  It starts out like a real lovey-dovey poem, and then it starts with the sky real south.  Oh, my God.  Go ahead, sir.  Let's go.  I hope you fall through the ice.  I reckon your death is going to be awesome.  It's called I Miss, and it's about what I miss about my wife.  If there's a part of it where you shoot or drive at her and miss, I'm going to bite  Louie's face.  Thank you for writing a poem about me. 
[03:20:30]  I miss.  Yeah.  I miss the companionship of a woman, the relationship that is woven.  And it goes on down here in the good shit.  It goes, I miss the precious golden band and the touch of your feminine hand.  I miss your sensual touch of your lips and the grinding sensation of our hips.  I miss your dripping pussy around my cock and the screaming, oh, please, don't stop.  Cock and stop don't rhyme, sir.  You know what, sir? 
[03:21:00]  Your poem makes me sick.  It sucks nigger dicks.  Why are we doing this, Don?  Hey, hey, hey, come on, man.  I miss your finger knuckle deep in my ass.  All right.  We get it, sir.  It's dirty.  It starts moving when it gets fresh.  I love your hips rubbing together before nips are hardened.  It's my rhymey, rhymey dirty.  Sir, this, I don't know.  I can just tell true stories that are worse than this.  This is horrible.  If I may make a poker analogy, this is like chasing a hand. 
[03:21:30]  We saw that we had a shitty opening hand, but we figured we're trying to catch cars,  and nothing's coming out.  And he's still reading his poem.  Nothing's coming out, and I'm still in it now.  And we ended up pot committed, and we had to fucking listen to the whole thing.  Well, I'm folding.  Yeah, the river car came, and it was a bomb.  Give me a chance.  All right, let's go.  All right, maybe we're too hard, right?  Get to the punchline, which we're hoping is a shotgun blast.  That's right.  Go ahead, Bud Dwyer.  Finish your poem.  Roses, red, violets, or blue? 
[03:22:00]  Get back.  I'm taking this out of the bag, you.  You.  Yeah, you had a rhyme.  I like that, Jimmy.  It was funny, but it also rhymed.  Can I finish?  Yes, sir.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Finish living, please.  I miss our tits rubbing together before nips are hardened.  I miss spewing in your mouth and then begging to be partied.  I miss sucking your toes and licking your nipples and keeping in rhythm when our waterbed ripples.  I miss the greasy feel of your full-body rub and the fisting and the fucking in the bathroom on the vanity and in the tub. 
[03:22:30]  I miss...  You stink on an incomprehensible level.  It's still going on.  In my post.  Oh, he thinks this is clear.  How many people have you bored with this?  You know what's good?  I'm understanding that anger Jimmy was talking about that goes from your neck to your pubic bone.  You're starting to feel it now.  Like, I'm feeling that actual, that same feeling.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  Because this guy's a sociopath.  He doesn't understand how awful this is.  He is terrible.  I seriously would like to...  It is. 
[03:23:00]  It's what?  Awful?  I want to get fucked in the ass by a man who has AIDS so that I can get it and give it to you.  Well, sir.  It would be worth it to get it so that I could give it to you in your mouth.  I'm going to help Louie out.  Your poem is...  Your mouth is so much better at drinking AIDS cum than saying poetry.  You ought to allocate it to the right skills.  It's awful, sir.  It's not entertaining.  It's not funny.  It's not ironic.  It's not clever.  You're rhyming dirty words. 
[03:23:30]  It's just...  It was good until you guys...  Oh, yeah.  It's us.  No, we fucked it up.  Yeah, it's our fault.  We fucked it up.  Thank you, Don.  Hey, it was good.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck.  No more calls from Indiana.  Indiana's calling privileges revoked because of your resident Don.  Let's get the Tyra on before we get out of here.  Let's do that.  Tyra's making a big deal about a picture that was in the tabloids. 
[03:24:00]  What was it?  Too old to fly.  Crow Cop.  Crow Cop highlight.  On YouTube.  All right.  You want to do the Tyra thing or what?  And then we get out of here.  She was having Larry King talking about that dumb bathing suit shot that the paparazzi took  of her while she was on vacation.  And everyone's laughing saying, wow, she's a fat pig.  Yeah.  Supposedly she gained like 30, 35 pounds over the holidays.  Well, Tyra, she can't stand that.  So she went on Larry King to talk about it?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, God. 
[03:24:30]  So then I guess on Thursday's show she gets the actual bathing suit and then puts it back  on and goes, do I look fat?  Sure she did.  But it's obvious that she cares.  It's obvious she got her body back in shape and maybe got a smaller version of the bathing  suit is what she's doing.  Yeah.  First and foremost, you're right.  Who fucking cares if her ass got fat?  And then she, but, but the fact that she got so upset about it, she's going to waste everybody's  fucking time.  Fucking vain.  What a shallow jig.  Fucking vain. 
[03:25:00]  Happens to be black cunt.  Right.  What a shallow self-centered pig.  Right.  Coincidentally, insignificantly black, stupid cunt.  What a fucking self-centered non-white.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Your weight fluctuates all the time.  It fluctuates, yeah, around 10, 12 pounds.  Was this pictures embarrassing to you?  You know, it wasn't that it was embarrassing because I don't think it's a reflection of what  my body is right now, although I do think one day it will be a reflection of my body 
[03:25:30]  because I like to eat.  I'm not obsessed with working out.  So it wasn't so much of an embarrassment.  It was just like, what is that?  And it's a big fat ass.  It's me because I thought there was such a rejoicing, but I think I understand it.  For so many years, I was this high fashion model and, you know, putting this image out  there that's so difficult to live up to, and so then these pictures come out and it's  like, oh, wow, you know, look at her.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  And it's like, no, that's not a reflection of my body.  But if it was, I'd come out and say, yeah, you guys, that's me. 
[03:26:00]  How do you dodge the fire hoses and German shepherds?  There's a war going on.  That was on CNN.  I didn't hear what Ann said.  What did you say?  It's out of touch, Larry King.  How do you dodge the German shepherds and fire hoses?  Like Larry never knows.  He said the other day, President Kennedy on his show.  He's totally out there.  I hear Rubenesque girls are in these days.  We'll be talking to Ruben on tomorrow's show.  He thinks that she's on his show because she was trying to get into a college and fucking 
[03:26:30]  Wallace stood in front of her and that's all he is.  So you're going to buy your freedom and then what?  So tell a fat ass, how does it fit in the back of the bus?  So, Harry, tell us about your railroad.  Is that what Harry Tubman did?  Yes.  All right, thank God.  Very good.  Fuck that one up.  Don's back.  Don.  Yeah.  What's the point of the poem?  Oh, man, I was out of breath and I couldn't read it very well because I was running down the  steps.  It wasn't about. 
[03:27:00]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  No one has asked this yet.  Why do you want to read a poem on our show today?  Well, because I wrote it in regards to my ex-wife and a lot of guys said it was funny.  What guys said it was funny?  I want their names and I'm going to have their funny bones revoked.  You making different voices for your own benefit.  Yeah, what guys said that was funny?  You like my poem?  Yes, I do, Don.  It was great.  All right, give us one more line.  A funny line.  Or a stanza.  The big last line.  Give us the best line in the poem. 
[03:27:30]  The one that you were like, wow, this is the best line.  Well, if I read it from the beginning.  Stop it.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Listen to direction, sir.  We only need the line that you feel is the best line of the poem.  The one where you wrote it down and went, holy shit, that's funny.  Give us that.  Okay.  How about the speech?  I hope he's still reading out of breath.  You dumb fuck.  A fucking smoker.  He lives in Aspen.  What a douche. 
[03:28:00]  More Tyra.  More Larry King.  And for them to say, you know, all these negative things.  I have a show, the Tyra Banks show, and so many girls that are, that do have that body  or that are even heavier than that, you know, look up to me and they say, Tyra, you weigh  30 pounds heavier than those models that are on the runway right now and you make me feel  beautiful.  I look at your body and I feel beautiful.  So when the tabloids are saying that that's ugly, that's disgusting, it makes me think  of my audience.  Oh, what a... 
[03:28:30]  Oh, my God.  Hey, that's kind of a backhanded compliment.  Oh, you smelly whore.  When they tell me it's ugly and disgusting, it makes me think of my audience.  You know something?  We feel the same way.  What a self-centered woman.  Rancid cunt.  Isn't she a fucking...  I hate her so much right now.  She's not doing this for her audience.  She's inspired her fat pig audience.  She can't bear bad news.  She's a fat pig.  Let's just...  Can we please somehow...  We're on the commercial radio in New York as well.  Yeah.  Please get the word Tyra's a fat pig. 
[03:29:00]  Tyra is a fat pig.  Can we send somebody...  Where's your show taped?  Is it New York?  L.A.  Oh, L.A.  Just the fact that she thinks...  L.A.  I have to go on CNN during a war and respond to people talking about my weight.  My weight gain.  Who cares if people called you fat?  You're on TV.  You're fucking rich.  You're black.  You have blonde hair.  Let's discuss that.  Dennis Rodman.  Jesus.  She obviously can lose the weight without much of a problem.  You got a fingernail on your throat.  You got a fingernail on your throat.  Yeah.  What?  Thinking about my audience. 
[03:29:30]  Bulimia.  All righty.  Why let tabloids bother you?  You know what?  They come and they go.  But I think that I have a responsibility.  I've dedicated this part.  The first part of my life was about myself.  How many magazine covers can I get?  How many fashion shows can I walk down?  You know, how many this, how many that?  But this next part of my life is not so much about self-gratification.  It's about me using this platform that I have, this talk show that I have, to encourage 
[03:30:00]  young women.  I wish that platform was a gallows.  I have women crying their eyes out to me, telling me that they want to hurt themselves  because of how they look, because they're getting talked about.  So I felt like I needed to say something.  Does she really believe me?  All you're saying is I'm not fat.  Yeah.  She's doing the opposite.  If she was to go on Larry King and say they're calling me fat and I don't care.  She's getting fatter.  She should be getting fatter.  Who cares?  This has no value to me as a person.  But she's saying, I am not.  I'm not fat.  No, she's showing that there's something to be ashamed of being a slightly under 10 model. 
[03:30:30]  And by the way, she has a second show called, what, Emerga's Top Model or whatever it's  called?  Yeah.  And it completely judges all of the women on their bodies.  Darwinist selection of people according to their fucking flesh, which is fucking evil  and cunty.  Holy shit.  She makes me hope America loses the war because she's inside of America.  I hope Iraq beats us.  You know what would be great?  I hope we become part of Iraq because I hate her so much.  If her car caught fire and then her whole face and head and neck was burned and she had 
[03:31:00]  to talk like, you ever see a burned person where it just looks like a kernel of corn nugget?  That's what I want her to have to talk like with a blonde wig, slightly askew on her head,  trying to do her show.  Honey, honey!  Because she has no lips and her teeth are just showing.  Call this fat?  Oh, fuck.  But I mean, that's what I want that shallow, personalityless pig to have to suffer with.  She is completely going against this. 
[03:31:30]  Here's what she did.  She was in the tabloids with a fat ass, a picture, in a bathing suit.  Yeah, so what?  She then gets called fat and gets upset.  She loses the weight and gets the same type of bathing suit to say it's the same bathing  suit and she's now skinny again in that bathing suit.  She goes on Larry King, talks about the fat picture and how it inspires her fat listeners  who cry about their body type and saying that it's not a bad thing, yet what she has done 
[03:32:00]  is lose the weight because it is a bad thing.  Yeah, she is.  She's teaching girls.  What the fuck is she doing?  She's helping girls think that if they have any fucking meat on their bones, they're pieces  of shit.  Right.  And she's right.  Don't lose the weight because you'll be called fat and instead of saying, I'm fine with  my body type, bow to the pressure, do whatever it takes to lose the weight and get back to  the body everyone loved you for.  Do you know what she should do?  If she really has self-respect, she would have addressed this on her show in one segment. 
[03:32:30]  She would have said, they're calling me fat.  They have a bad picture of me.  Look, we all take crappy pictures.  I mean, if that's what they're going to focus on, who cares?  They're shallow.  And then went on with their show.  Then the message would be real.  Oh, would they have applauded her?  But that would have been real.  Yeah.  Like, look, yeah, that's an awful picture.  God almighty.  I actually said, yeah, you know what?  I gained a lot of weight and then there's my ass and I had a great time gaining it.  Yeah.  I was eating and drinking.  Look, I'm swimming in a beautiful blue waters down.  Hey, Ian Bernardo, not to change subjects really fast for American Idol, you know, Gloria. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  You're always on the run now.  Oh, I guess he's on my pal Brother Weez's show, Trashing Us Right Now.  Anyone in Rochester that could tune that in real fast for us?  What is that fucking faggot trashing us for?  I'm trying to find, get to the bottom of that.  Enough.  All right, back to Tyra.  You're done.  Hopefully somebody in the Rochester area could tune in WCMF.  Suck a cock for me.  Here we go.  Oh, not me.  Now, according to people, your biggest source of figure angst is your bus size.  Yes, it is.  Do you have a large bus for a fashion model? 
[03:33:30]  Yes.  Even when I was a fashion model, I was around a, um, I feel so strange talking to you about  bus size right now.  Does the master of the house ever suckle them after you've been in the field all day?  How much do you cost?  You've got good childbearing hips.  Can I check your teeth?  Why did you, why did you spit in Sandy Duncan's water?  A large bus for a fashion model?  Yes, even when I was a fashion model, I was around a, um, I feel so strange talking to  you about bus size right now. 
[03:34:00]  Do you really?  Fucking liar.  Because it's like, but I don't know.  It's just, I don't know.  I'm a white man.  I could have you shot with that.  Okay, dear.  But, um, when I was a model, I was around a cup, a C cup, and now I'm a little bit bigger  than a D.  I don't like to say what it is, but I...  So you would not be a bold model today, right?  Uh, no.  There's no way, I don't think.  No.  Double D tits and fat, dark manhole-covered nipples.  Yeah.  I like to suckle them and then kill her.  Nice.  I feel weird talking about bus size. 
[03:34:30]  Okay, I'll just call them tits.  Wouldn't it be funny if he tried to improv and he goes, well, who are you, Nancy Reagan?  We'll be back.  Or maybe not.  Why don't they want well-busted women?  Well-busted women?  Well-busted?  Well-busted.  What's that?  She broke?  Exactly.  Or is she a criminal who got caught?  Larry King's got a tit fetish.  I know.  That's great.  She opened the door and now it's all about the tits. 
[03:35:00]  I love your bosom.  Yeah, why don't they like tits?  I was just going to say, I was going to call her a chesty Negro.  A Negro.  Why don't they want well-busted women?  Well-busted women?  Well, you know, when I was a fashion model, high fashion model, this was like 15 years ago,  certain designers would bind my breasts down with ace bandages.  But why?  Why is that?  Because it didn't fit the clothes.  They made clothes that were a certain size and it didn't fit my chest, but yet still they 
[03:35:30]  wanted me in their fashion show.  And they wanted me in the show so bad that they bounced like that.  Because you're so great.  Right.  African-American waste of cum.  She's just the worst.  Is she still on XM?  Yeah.  I heard her show stinks.  Can someone...  Look, do we have any listeners in LA who know where her show is that would be willing  to stand outside with a sign that just says, Tyra's a fat pig?  Tyra's a fat pig?  Oh, it's just with a big bucket of cum and a sign that says, none of this is for you. 
[03:36:00]  It's got to be hung over the freeway.  Yeah.  For everybody to see it.  He's a fat pig.  Get that done.  Oh, we got POWs out there.  Yes, we do.  A bucket.  You're right.  Maybe one of the POWs out west will...  She is just so self-centered.  Oh, what a self-important...  Well, here we go.  I'm a little lost.  Wouldn't most women desire a curvy figure?  You know, I...  Yeah.  I think...  A little curvy good.  I think...  You know, the sad thing is, I used to speak at colleges. 
[03:36:30]  I was on a college lecture circuit.  And I spoke at Johns Hopkins and Georgetown and UCLA.  Yeah, you belong at Johns Hopkins.  Various other colleges.  And I talked about how the female body goes in and out of fashion.  The different types of bodies.  In the 50s, it was Merlin Monroe.  You know, curvaceous, size 14.  In the 60s, it was 20.  Size 14, yeah.  And you couldn't sit at a diner fucking bench.  And in the 80s, it was more athletic.  And then the 90s was kind of heroin chic.  And then now, it's even beyond that.  They were calling Kate Moss skinny in the 90s. 
[03:37:00]  These girls are way skinnier than her.  Yeah, that's hot.  Way to bring it home and sound like a college lecturer.  Way skinnier.  I like girls that look like a sack full of antlers.  I love that line.  Just fucking clavicles.  Clavicles and shoulder blades.  A bulldozer should be pushing them into a hole in black and white films.  Oh, fuck.  What did you say?  It looks like a bulldozer should be pushing them into holes in black and white films.  Oh, is that horrible? 
[03:37:30]  Grotesque music playing.  Well-dressed townspeople throwing them in a hole.  Crying and throwing them in because the army forced them to.  Hey, we got a timing issue.  We got a timing issue here.  Damn it.  For the 11 o'clock hour, we want to replay the bottle rocket incident.  It's 55 minutes long.  The whole thing?  The whole thing.  Wow.  We decided to do this and then try to figure out heat shield and how it's going to work  best.  E-Rock's got that together for us because we played that little clip earlier today.  I'm going to be interested to listen to this because this went out over regular radio. 
[03:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  And what we got away with back then was just unbelievable.  And we also played today because coming soon to the show, less than 10 days, So Your Pussy's  Got Talent.  Next Thursday.  So Your Pussy's Got Talent.  Nine days and counting.  I cannot wait.  So Your Pussy's Got Talent.  Any new ideas?  Quickly?  Anybody?  Deadline's tomorrow, though.  Deadline is tomorrow for new ideas.  Do we have any ideas at all?  I got a brainstorm.  Oh, Danny has the best one.  What?  Danny has the best idea. 
[03:38:30]  And if he could work this out, it's a winner.  It's one girl, one vagina, not a bunch of vaginas competing against each other.  It's guys coming up with ideas.  What do you do with a vagina?  He said a Rube Goldberg type setup where a marble falls into a funnel and hits a teeter  totter and a boot hits a domino.  And the final thing is her just laying there and a finger just goes, a plastic finger goes  into her pussy after this whole big extravagant Rube Goldberg contraption works. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah, he's working on it.  How great is that?  How funny.  Great.  Especially if he makes the pressure way higher than she thinks and the finger goes in really  far.  It just shoots up to the womb.  But she should be part just the middle of the thing.  Because the thing with Rube Goldberg was that it would always do something like just  turn on a light switch.  So the finger going up her pussy should make her jump in the top of her head.  Her jump a little.  Make some mouse run and chase some cheese or whatever it is.  And the light goes out.  That's great.  All right.  Well, she pokes through her asshole into something else. 
[03:39:30]  Just so she's part of a circuit.  Yeah, she's not even the payoff.  No, not at all.  The finger going in her pussy is just one of a long chain of boring events.  About as important as a boot hitting a domino.  God damn.  I never even thought of that.  That's perfect.  All right, listen.  We've got to wrap this up so we can do that.  So we've got line of the day.  We start with a runner-up line of the day.  Ooh.  Thanks to Bowdogfight.net.  Calm.  Calm, calm.  Here's runner-up line of the day. 
[03:40:00]  Why don't deaf people always lisp?  What?  They always lisp.  Why don't they know?  Because they're all gay.  Because they're all gay.  It's just a weird coincidence.  Two strikes by God.  Deaf gay jerk.  Let me see, Kay.  I never knew that either.  You're going to do a show for us on 202 on Saturday night?  What is it?  What are you talking about?  We just give people shows.  On Saturday?  Could be an hour.  Down the road. 
[03:40:30]  Whatever you want.  Oh.  Patricia, do it this Saturday.  We'll give you a couple hours and do whatever you want with it.  That would be a lot of fun.  I'd like that.  All right.  Thanks for asking me.  Because people are asking.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  People are asking.  So we'll figure it out.  People digging the Louie.  A Saturday down the road, it'll be just you in here with whoever the fuck you want.  Okay.  Doing what you want to do.  Thank you.  All right?  I appreciate it.  And let's not forget Lucky Louie on DVD starting today.  I'm going to go buy it after.  I never bought a DVD that I'm in.  Yeah, that's what...  We should just go do impromptu signings.
