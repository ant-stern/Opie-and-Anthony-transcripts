<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a furious reaction to an email from John Minnelli, a CBS Radio program director, criticizing a segment featuring a man being spanked â€“ a continuation of a bit from the Ron and Fez show. Opie and Anthony vehemently defended the segment, framing it as satire of their show's perceived recent shift towards overly "gay" content due to management restrictions and a lack of female guests. They contrasted their multifaceted, occasionally raunchy style with that of the more formulaic Preston and Steve show, citing past stunts like the homeless shopping spree and eggnog drinking contest as examples of their success in generating publicity.  The discussion included graphic descriptions of past studio incidents,  detailed breakdowns of Preston and Steve's segments ("Porno or No-No," "1-800-YourName," "Toddler Theater," "Butt-Plug Karaoke"), and copious expletives.  The hosts also complained about their studio's inadequate heating.  The segment concluded with a brief mention of a news story involving the show and a website, promising further discussion later.

The broadcast continued with a diverse range of topics, including Anna Nicole Smith's death, Howard Stern's engagement, and an audio clip from Eastside Dave. A significant portion was dedicated to the recurring "Gay or Funny" segment, featuring listener-submitted stories.  Other topics included Valentine's Day news coverage, Opie's JetBlue flight delay, and an interview with Nicolas Cage.  The show featured audio and video clips, notably "E-Rock Waxing" and the aforementioned "man-on-man bare-bottom spanking" bit. The hosts also discussed a news story about a fan who ran an unofficial Opie and Anthony website (OAVirus.com) and was jailed for possessing child pornography, stressing their lack of involvement.  A listener called to criticize their handling of this story.  A phone call with Bob Saget followed, covering his film *March of the Penguins*, his father's death, funeral arrangements (including dark humor about space burial), and the game show *1 vs. 100*.  The segment ended with promotion of their XM radio show.

Further conversation with Bob Saget delved into his father's death, marked by dark humor from both Saget and the hosts.  A call from Bob Kelly shifted the focus to Anna Nicole Smith's death and a news story about an 84-year-old woman sexually abusing an 11-year-old boy, prompting crude and sexually suggestive commentary from the hosts.  Kelly also promoted his movie, "Farce of the Penguins," and they played an absurd game adding "Shwoogie" to song lyrics.  The segment included multiple listener calls and ended with a Mike Tyson audio clip containing homophobic slurs and violent language.

Another segment began with graphic descriptions of sexual acts, transitioned into a recurring bit about a co-host, Sam, whose head was supposedly filled with candy, and involved the creation of a listener contest to finish a "gay" song titled "Convertible Boy." The hosts played "What What In The Butt," and the discussion included listener calls, more sexually explicit descriptions, and a story about one host's brother's childhood masturbation incident.  The segment concluded with a female listener, Maria, performing a masturbation act on air with a vibrator, followed by Holly providing details about her physical attributes to win a prize. The entire segment was characterized by crude sexual humor, graphic descriptions, and frequent offensive language.

The final segment featured a sexually explicit conversation with listener Holly Bimmel, focusing on her body size, sex life, and masturbation methods. The hosts suggested various objects for sexual use, discussed her C-section experiences, and made inappropriate comments on childbirth and female anatomy.  Another listener, Kendra from Nebraska, joined in a similarly suggestive conversation involving an electric toothbrush.  The segment concluded with the "Line of the Day" contest and a brief promotion of Robert Kelly's stand-up show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony, and James Norton.  Shut up! Shut up!  No!  Opie.  I'm stung because I'm a shapely European blonde.  Anthony.  Jesus, we are just whores.  James Norton.  Look at his face. How do you not love it and want to kiss it?  You rock.  Sex Vagel here on the radio with you. 
[00:00:30]  Sex Vagel.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  And Sex Vagel gets hit with poker chips.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  I don't think the poker chip thing was explained well enough.  People might not have gotten it.  Maybe we should explain it more. 
[00:01:00]  Shut up.  Oh, brother.  Wow.  Gripe right out of the gate.  Ooh.  You never see that happen on the ONA show.  Boy, are we just...  Oh.  We are billed bitches.  We're just bitching all the time about things.  Oh.  But we don't mean to, bitch.  I'll tell you that much.  I would love to come in here.  Here's my dream.  I come in here.  Everything's what I like to call hunky-dory.  Yeah.  But there's always just some... 
[00:01:30]  Some problem.  Some fly in the ointment.  You ever seen a fly in an ointment?  Yeah?  It never gets out.  Take a picture.  I've never seen one.  Yeah, I've seen it.  The fly gets stuck.  And fly in the ointment.  It just finally gives up.  Its little fly muscles just give up finally.  Can someone just take the fly out of the ointment?  What's so bad about flies in the ointment?  Yeah.  Maybe we should just give up. 
[00:02:00]  Another banner evening.  I'm sitting there staring at the ceiling.  Wondering how badly we suck.  We are so not on the same page with...  With the programming staff here at CBS Radio.  It's unbelievable.  I got an email.  How about the same book would be nice?  I got an email last night in Stupid Me.  I'm like, oh.  This has to be an email about how good the show was yesterday.  Yeah, it's so much like the old N.E.W. show that people just adored. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, they adored it.  And it's gotten back to that.  I swear to God.  We've said it over the years.  We know when we have a bad show.  We walk out of the studio and we call each other.  We're kind of bummed out.  We talk each other out of jumping in front of buses, out in front of the building.  Yeah.  Not today, Ope.  But I'll tell you what.  If tomorrow stinks, I'll join you.  We'll just hop in front of a bus.  Yeah.  But yesterday, I thought we had a really, really good show.  But I got an email from John Minnelli last night, and he wants me to reply to it. 
[00:03:00]  If he's listening, I'm not replying to your stupid email.  Reply?  This is what I have to say.  I don't think you get the Ope and Anthony show.  I think we got a major effing problem at this point.  In his email, he's mentioning Preston and Steve and how they have a good show and they're  well prepared.  And then I'm thinking, well, he's also the guy that likes John and Jeff because I think  he was the one that hired them to be on the air before us, these two douches out of L.A. 
[00:03:30]  So I'm like, why am I even talking to this guy?  Why bother?  Why bother?  Are you effing kidding me?  And then the XM people yesterday, they called and said, hey, they loved the show yesterday.  Doesn't matter.  So now my head is effed up.  It is effed up.  I'm confused as hell now.  Because there's a bunch of panicky Pete's around here, so they're going to micromanage  the show.  So he's breaking down yesterday's show, I'm not going to exaggerate, but almost break 
[00:04:00]  by break.  Yeah.  Break by break.  And I'm sitting here like, did he hear the show yesterday?  Critiquing things that I don't really think were understood as to why we did them and in  what context we did it.  This is why his feedback on yesterday's show stinks.  He's commenting on stuff that we'll never do again.  So how does that help me?  Yeah.  How does that help me? 
[00:04:30]  He thought us playing the guy on guy spanking yesterday was awful, like no one got it.  We didn't explain it.  Because we didn't explain it.  We didn't explain it good enough.  What was there to explain?  It was our Valentine's Day show, and we were goofing on ourselves how awful our show has  become.  Then on Valentine's Day, it came down to one man spanking another man.  Spanking another man.  What is there to get?  Until his ass cheek was bloodied.  That was it.  And the thought that we had to explain the entire context and reasoning behind why the 
[00:05:00]  guy was being spanked at the time.  Ron and Fez, how they were involved.  Why didn't we just bring up the Earl situation?  Oh, sorry.  Should I explain that?  I mean, there are things that we didn't explain because that wasn't the point of the break.  The point of the break was that the show had gotten so gay by that point that it was ridiculous  that on Valentine's Day, a day of love between you and your gal. 
[00:05:30]  And we even goof like other shows are probably marrying couples.  They do mass marriages or they get a gay couple to get married on their show because that's  outrageous.  Outrageous.  And that gets the local press talking.  Or you release like a blow-up doll like Preston and Steve did.  That's good radio?  That's brilliant stuff, Opie.  That's good radio?  Great radio.  It's the hack it.  Because he kind of got pissed because I said that Preston and Steve are hacks, and they 
[00:06:00]  are hacks, by the way.  Of course they are.  It's the typical morning show drivel, milk toast crap that you're going to get when you  tune into any other radio station across the country.  They got the hole in there.  They got some bitch's point of view to keep the guys in check.  Oh, guys.  And they got the two guys doing the hacky, pull-the-show-prep-off-the-internet garbage  that's well-organized. 
[00:06:30]  I guess that's what he likes.  Hey, if it's 7 a.m., you should be doing this.  At 7.30, go to this if it's Thursday.  And on Wednesday at 8 o'clock, we expect to hear this, and the people love hearing it.  Is that what you want?  A schedule?  Holy Jesus Christ.  They are hacks, and the bit they did for Valentine's Day where you let a blow-up doll  Yeah, with the helium in it and helium balloons tied to it.  And the person that finds it gets a prize? 
[00:07:00]  Gets a prize.  Hold.  Continue.  Every morning zoo in America has done that bit.  That's why we call them hacks, John.  Don't you get it?  Do you get anything?  And the reasoning behind doing that spanking bit yesterday, replaying it from the XM show  on this show, was a whole other bit.  It wasn't us trying to bring over what we did on XM here and recreate it.  You didn't see that? 
[00:07:30]  And the whole reasoning behind playing it was, look what the hell we're doing on Valentine's  Day.  There's a man being spanked by another man.  Where the hell did we go wrong?  Right.  That was the bit.  If we now got to explain ourselves, which disgusts me that we have to explain ourselves.  It was pretty obvious to everybody listening.  Of course it was.  Who cares?  We were beating ourselves up going, oh my God, look how pathetic we are.  Just keep micromanaging.  And you know what?  There is no explanation to the bit. 
[00:08:00]  At the end of our XM show, Ron and Fez brought one of their guys in to get spanked.  It's apparently something that happened.  The guy didn't even do anything wrong.  Yeah.  He just had a, he has a lower, what, threshold for pain.  Yeah.  That was the bit.  So he screams and yells when he gets hit, like a woman.  It really is funny to hear a guy with that high-pitched screaming like a girl.  It didn't matter where it came from or anything. 
[00:08:30]  We weren't trying to bring the whole moment over there, over here.  And then he used that sound clip to make a whole nother thing over here.  Because after we left yesterday's show, because see, see, in CBS's world, we only do a three-hour show.  In the Opie and Anthony world, we do five to five and a half hours of radio every day.  To us, it is one show.  So to us, by the end of our show, it got really gay.  And Ant and I walked out of the building, and that kind of bothered us. 
[00:09:00]  Like, what the hell is going wrong with the show?  So, of course, we brought it to the next day's show, which happened to be on regular FM radio.  Yeah, in this studio.  That's all.  But see, CBS and XM, they don't want to work together.  They don't want to acknowledge each other.  They got to start talking.  I'm out of my mind.  I'm confused.  I'm doubting what we do.  Because...  Oh, yeah, that's a real good thing to do.  I'm not even kidding, because these people over here think we suck. 
[00:09:30]  They really do.  They think that we suck.  Because that's what I read into these emails.  That's what I'm getting out of it.  Sorry.  And then when we go over to XM, we can't do any wrong.  It's micromanaged garbage.  So, just so everyone's on the same page, you know, because I've been accused of not keeping it honest,  here is the exact email I got last night.  Exact word for word.  Word for word.  And you listen to this email, and you tell me what I should think.  I think, I'll tell you ahead of time, that they hate everything we're doing.  Everything. 
[00:10:00]  Well...  And if you think Preston and Steve are so terrific, trust me, I'm sure they would love to move to New York and do radio for you.  Freaking, I know one of the guys used to live on Long Island.  He would love to come up here.  If you think they're so great.  Bunch of hacks.  They wouldn't last a week in New York.  And by they, you mean John.  That's who the email's from.  So, I get this email, and I'm thinking, you know, I think this is going to be a nice email, positive email.  There was a lot of energy and a lot of good breaks yesterday. 
[00:10:30]  We've tweaked the show over the past couple of months.  Right.  It's blatantly obvious to us.  And we've definitely seen from the listeners, it's obvious to them now.  You know, there's a little delay.  We know when we make little changes.  And then the audience picks up on it a little while later.  And we've noticed.  The phone's lit every morning.  But then you get an email like this, and it's like, why even bother? 
[00:11:00]  It's unbelievable.  Why even bother?  I thought we were years away from this crap that we used to have to deal with.  And I'm not humoring this guy and writing him back.  And at this point, he's this guy.  We have a real problem.  He writes, Greg, I honestly don't know the answer to this, so I'm asking in all earnestness, what is the benefit gained in spending large chunks of time discussing an event that happened yesterday on the XM show? 
[00:11:30]  First of all, it wasn't a large amount of time.  It was an underlying theme for the show, yes, because we've realized that it's a little gay lately.  We were ripping hair out of E-Rock's body.  Yeah.  And the fact of the matter is, we want to have girls up here and do things, but we've been stopped by management from doing that.  Well, he gets into that.  I know he gets into that, too.  We don't need to do the shocking stuff.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did you listen to our show back in the day? 
[00:12:00]  You know what your email's doing, by the way?  Just talking to him.  You know what it's doing?  You're forcing us to do something really screwed up.  Really stupid.  You're forcing us to do something stupid.  This is textbook Opie and Anthony.  We get crap like this as we're working our asses off, regardless of what your opinion might be,  that we're skipping through life with our shoelaces untied, with an incompetent staff coming in here and calling it in every day. 
[00:12:30]  That seems to be what the impression is.  But believe it or not, we're actually working to do a show.  And then when we get crap like this emailed to us, you're forcing us to go out and grab a couple to screw in a church or go out on the streets and unleash the show on the populace so that we lose complete control of the show and put it in the hands of some idiot that's going to burn down a house full of children.  Or just something, just something that'll screw things up because we're feeling now that we have to do something to put ourselves over the top. 
[00:13:00]  Because what we're doing by working hard and actually trying to put on an entertaining show seems to be crap in your eyes.  Yeah, they don't like the show.  It's obvious to me.  And what are they doing to help us and make it easier for us?  What are they doing?  The emails like this isn't doing the job.  Anthony sits in this studio once again this morning.  And I'm trying not to put my coat on as well.  But he's in a huge winter coat. 
[00:13:30]  I'm in a parka.  Know why?  Because the effing studio is freezing.  They can't even give us a warm studio.  They can't even figure out how to get heat in here at 5.30 in the morning.  15 degrees out.  We gave up.  We bitched and complained about this over and over again.  We just stopped.  We walk in.  It's freezing in here.  Half the mornings, Anthony's in a coat doing a morning show.  That's not normal.  No.  Makes me feel like, you know, I'm just stopping in to say hi and I'm ready to leave.  My hands are freezing. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  I got my arms crossed and my hands in my pocket.  I got long johns on and like ski socks and layers.  So I'm all right.  But my hands are definitely cold.  They can't even do that for us.  They can't even figure out how to get heat in here.  It's unbelievable.  So let's see.  Where were you?  What is the benefit gained in spending large chunks of time discussing an event that happened yesterday on the XM show? 
[00:14:30]  It involved people that most of the listeners don't know, at least not yet.  They didn't need to know the people in a show that most listeners can't hear.  It was as though someone was describing every detail of a great party that we weren't invited to.  Almost seemed rude.  Well, I hope we're never rude on the air.  We were getting phone calls from all our markets and I was using the phone lines of people that don't have XM.  So that makes me think these people didn't hear it on XM. 
[00:15:00]  They were enjoying what they were hearing yesterday.  Because again, again, if I could just pump it through your head, it wasn't to be presented as a replay of what we did on XM.  It was an entirely different subject using some clips from the show that we did on XM.  You take the clips, we bring them over here and then turn it into something else.  Like how on Valentine's Day or around Valentine's Day did this show turn into this where a man is spanking another man. 
[00:15:30]  Do you have to know the names of the guys?  Do you have to know their occupation?  Do you have to know why they're being spanked?  Who's doing the spanking?  What he's using on his hand?  How far down his pants were?  Are these the details that make it great?  No, of course not.  It's simple.  Here's a guy spanking another guy.  Why the hell are we doing this?  Where are the girls?  Right.  That's the whole thing. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  Your stupid email pissed us off because you didn't get it.  Well, no, no, no, no.  I'm critiquing his email.  No, because he's doing this now too and it's not going to work.  This email only went to me.  It only went to me.  I had to forward it to Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, it would be nice.  Send it to both of us.  What are you doing?  Like a divide and conquer crap?  Yeah, we've been through that too for over a dozen years.  I don't think it would work.  So please, could you just maybe CC me? 
[00:16:30]  Further, the audio you played of yesterday's XM events made almost no sense.  There was no setup, no context, no idea who was doing what to whom.  This is so ridiculous.  I don't even know what to tell you.  We completely set it up.  Set up or context?  No idea.  Did you nod off?  No idea who was doing what to whom.  It was a guy getting spanked by another guy.  That's all you needed to know yesterday.  As often happens when you and many do visual events, we hear a lot of noise and laughter 
[00:17:00]  but have no clue as to what actually is happening.  And then, of course, he has to, you know, throw this little jab in.  Howard Stern, you have to admit, was a master at involving listeners in visual events.  So go over to Sirius and get a job.  I'm sure they'll pay you $8 billion to walk around the hallways.  Seems to be what they do.  Oh, Christ.  Also, I don't understand, but would really like to. 
[00:17:30]  This condescending BS doesn't work with me.  It never has.  I'd rather walk than just actually play this game with you.  Oh, are you setting us up?  Also, I don't understand, but would really like to.  Would you?  Well, guess what?  You're pulling back the slingshot, my friend.  The frequent Too Hot for Corporate references yesterday.  As we've discussed many times, your strains aren't in the raunchy area anyway.  They aren't?  Let me explain something to you, John.  I'll explain something.  We made a living off being raunchy, you dope. 
[00:18:00]  We are, I consider ourselves anyway, and people might chuckle, but I definitely consider ourselves  multifaceted.  I think we don't have to go down that road.  And I think we've done a good job of covering other things, popular culture, current events  in our own style.  But that's part of what we do.  It always has been.  Not shocking.  We're not looking every day to do some kind of wacky, zany, let's bring a chicken here 
[00:18:30]  and do something to her for the sheer shock value.  But it's part of the machine.  It's part of what we do.  And it was a big part of what we do years ago.  And we'd like to actually incorporate a tenth of a percent of that into this program.  And the reason we bitch about management keeping us from doing it is because, let me think,  management's keeping us from doing it. 
[00:19:00]  I don't care how many emails you write to try to convince yourself that it's not.  He wasn't a fan going into the homeless shopping spree.  He wasn't a fan of the baby bird and the hangout drinking contest.  With thousands of people showing up at the mall for the homeless shopping spree.  That's why we've got to make the problem.  Getting the press with Boston and the mayor and that controversy from it.  How about that?  It's called making a buzz.  It sure ain't going to happen just handing out a few bumper stickers or...  Or going, hey, did you hear what Butch had to say today?  Or making sure that we hit a break or a phone call that we're supposed to get at 8 o'clock exactly. 
[00:19:30]  That ain't going to do it.  It's 2007.  As we've discussed many times, your strengths aren't in the raunchy area anyway.  Plus, there's really nothing left that radio talent can do legally to shock the public or media.  Yeah.  And create so-called water cooler moments.  It's been done, done, and done.  Well, let me refer to the baby bird.  Bird, I can name things we haven't done yet, but let me just refer to something we did do. 
[00:20:00]  The baby bird.  Eggnog drinking contest.  Pat Fumanaki wins the whole thing and decides to puke up all the eggnog on a future intern, Patrick Duffy.  Who was the guy, by the way, that spanked Eastside Dave, if you need to know.  Oh, you're explaining it.  Thank God I know now.  Before the video even hit the internet, and I know we have to keep it in radio terms,  people were saying, oh my God, that was one of the most unbelievable things I've ever heard on the radio.  Okay, on the radio, on the radio, on the radio.  Unbelievable.  I couldn't believe I was hearing that.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[00:20:30]  I couldn't believe some guy could puke that much.  This was all comments from just the radio show.  Yeah.  That created water cooler talk.  And then with the video, because we're incorporating videos into our show,  because you've got to do something different and think out of the box.  If you're doing radio in the year 2007, we popped the video up on some of these popular websites.  And break.com alone, it got well over, I think it was up to 1.3 million views the last time I looked on one website alone.  That's water cooler talk.  And that's something we've done recently. 
[00:21:00]  And that's great self-promotion.  So what are you talking about that it's been done, done, and done?  Similarly, I really don't think that playing the censorship card as in over bleeping the XM audio  and claiming free FM editing that doesn't exist is a valid strategy.  No, when we played the guy on guy spanking yesterday, there was a lot of cursing,  because over there we just kind of, whatever, talk like human beings.  And when we were playing over here yesterday, there were a couple of things in there. 
[00:21:30]  I'm like, whoa, are they going to let that go?  Because the rules are different.  Believe me, that was under bleeped.  And everything that was bleeped.  I heard, I forget exactly, but I heard something in there yesterday.  I'm like, I think they probably are going to dump out of that as well as they should.  Does he honestly think we threw bleeps in there where they didn't belong to make it sound more outrageous than it was?  Like we were beating up CBS.  We weren't beating up CBS.  We didn't care yesterday about the fact that the language is different between the two companies.  We were just bringing something, which we do from time to time, that we did over at XM and brought it over here. 
[00:22:00]  Cleaned it up for here, and that was it.  We didn't add bleeps to make some kind of point yesterday.  You want us to pull the bleeps and play it?  Well, pull any bleep you want.  And if you don't believe me, email Steve.  He'll give you what we played yesterday, or you got it on tape because you taped the show every day,  and we'll give you the original audio, and you can match up and realize that every bleep had to be there.  Yeah.  Holy crap.  Like it was a bit.  Oh, my God. 
[00:22:30]  That doesn't exist as a valid strategy.  You know, he thinks we're doing that as some kind of strategy.  Let's face it.  Stern burned out that particular bitch and moan over 15 boring months.  His ratings dropped also.  Get it?  Additionally, I'm completely puzzled by your claims that corporate wants you to do man-on-man spanking as opposed to, I presume by inference, girl-on-girl spanking.  If you have problems with anything we say or do, feel free to disagree.  But please don't say we said to do things that we didn't and never would. 
[00:23:00]  That's called a goof.  It's called having fun.  It's called a goof.  We take what is presented.  We've been trying to get girls in here to just dump things like crawl around the floor in their broad panties or hopefully, you know, topless.  Yeah.  And blindfolded and tried to find money.  You've said no to everything that-  That involves any type of girl with nudity or really any type of girl, for the love of God, just to do something on this show. 
[00:23:30]  But when it came down to E-Rock getting Brazilian wax-  It was okay.  He had to be naked.  His bottom was naked because that's how Brazilian wax is done.  So he's there on mic, on our show, bottomless, and that's okay.  But we can't have a woman.  We're not allowed to have a naked woman in here.  So you're saying we're a little off if we translate that into the fact that management is being gay?  Yeah.  That we can't have a naked woman in here. 
[00:24:00]  We said that we think management is gay.  And you don't find that a reasonable assessment of the situation?  And we were joking.  That's the sad part.  He doesn't even know when we're joking and when we're being real.  This is being real.  Yesterday when we were goofing on guy-on-guy spanking and they don't want a hot girl getting spanked.  That's obviously a goof, a radio bitch.  There's humor in that.  It wasn't like they came in here and forced us to do that.  Management came in here and forced us.  There you go.  It's our show.  We did it. 
[00:24:30]  There you go.  It was funny.  And it's funny to goof on the fact that we can't have girls doing the same thing we could have guys doing.  And to blame management for the fact that they're homos.  There you go.  It's funny.  There you go.  All right.  We'll tear down the fourth wall.  Yeah.  We were just goofing on you.  Let's just rip that down.  Is it okay that we goofed on the fact that management's gay?  Let's explain it to a three-year-old.  Dope.  Dude, come on.  Do you get our show?  Do you get radio in general?  I really thought.  Did you take it personally and now you have to go after me? 
[00:25:00]  If you're taking this crap personally, then you really should not be the program director of our show.  Please move on.  This is what we do.  You need to have a thick skin because we beat up everybody, including ourselves.  Move on to another show.  Fire us.  Whatever you want to do.  And this is the PS.  You're not understanding this program.  I really did think he had an understanding of this show based on when he was a writer for The Post and talking to him. 
[00:25:30]  I thought he had some real understanding of what this show is about.  He does not understand this program.  He takes things way too seriously.  He micromanages way too much on every little thing we do because he's a structure guy.  So if we do something from 730 to 740 that he feels isn't good, wow, that's 10 minutes.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Take the show on the whole. 
[00:26:00]  It's an average.  Here's the PS, which makes me just realize we can't really talk to the guy about our show anymore.  PS, just to keep everything honest and open and fair, I have to say I disagree with your opinion.  And we'll give him a lot of press today.  Oh, well.  But trust me, we're not scared by it.  Listen up, Philly.  Just to keep everything honest and open and fair, I have to say I disagree with your opinion that Preston and Steve are hacks.  I listened to them at great length recently.  I guess he's trying to hire him or something.  And heard an excellent morning radio. 
[00:26:30]  There's no question that these guys spend hours and hours working on their show and all of its many elements.  And they are fully on their toes during it.  The effort clearly shows, not just in the sound of the show, but also in their ratings, which are huge and growing.  Go screw, man.  Just enough.  It's hack radio.  I don't care if it works or not.  Dude.  It's something we are incapable of doing.  We can't have a bitch. 
[00:27:00]  We can't have some bitch sitting in on our show throwing in our, oh, gosh, guys.  We can't throw on the dopey radio voice and run through scheduled events every week with the wacky stunt guy and the goofy characters that are done at exactly 915 every day or Monday into Thursday.  We bring in this guy and he'll discuss the movies and, you know, that might be the kind of radio you want. 
[00:27:30]  And if it is, sorry, it ain't this show.  It's never been this show.  And look, this is why we can't talk anymore, John.  I'm sorry, but we can't.  And if it means like we blow up our spot here, so be it.  You know what?  I don't really care.  I really don't because you're confusing the hell out of us.  And we know how to do our show.  And I'll take that chance by just continuing doing what we're doing.  And if it works, great.  If it doesn't, oh, well, go hire Preston and Steve.  Preston and Steve because they do such terrific bits like porno or no-no. 
[00:28:00]  If our listeners want to hear this, then I have nothing left to give.  You like that?  I have nothing left to give.  You like that, John?  These are the bits.  What the hell is it?  These are the bits that they're so proud of that it's on their website.  This is what they're featuring and highlighting and making sure everyone knows about.  Porno or no-no?  A game based on a simple yes or no style answer from the listener.  Preston will read the name of an adult movie,  and the listener will have to decide if that title is the name of an actual adult film or not. 
[00:28:30]  Are you kidding me?  That's good, huh?  1-800-YourName is another game they play, possibly the most original-styled game in their arsenal.  The cast will tell listeners to call in and give up to seven letters in their name.  For example, John Walsh would give them J-O-H-N-W-A-L.  They would then dial the corresponding letters on the phone with the 1-800 extension.  The caller will win a prize, sometimes of their choice, if they reach a real person. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, let me tear down another wall.  The FCC doesn't allow you to do this on the air live, schmuck.  You're not allowed to make phone calls on the air live and just pop someone on.  Anytime you hear a prank phone call or any type of phone call, it's bullcrap.  It's taped, and then they get permission from the person beforehand.  It's a whole thing that goes down.  Or if that was a fact, I'd spend all day on the phone right here in front of the mic calling people,  asking them if they have Prince Albert in a can and let him out. 
[00:29:30]  He's suffocating.  Or calling bowling alleys and asking if they have 15-pound balls and then asking them how do they walk.  It gets hysterical.  And then the old refrigerator running, you better catch it.  But you can't do that anymore.  And they do toddler theater.  Occasionally, Preston will record his two children.  So do some of our website people, apparently.  Oh, don't let me explain that later.  Yeah, we will explain.  We're involved with a ridiculous story today. 
[00:30:00]  We'll get into that a little later.  Toddler Theater.  Occasionally, Preston will record his two children saying lines from well-known movies  and will have callers attempt to name the movie.  Are you kidding me?  This is the show that he thinks is fantastic.  Are you kidding me?  This is the show that our program director, that we have to meet with,  and that critiques us by email on a minute-by-minute basis of our show.  Do you get the concept of exaggeration, John, when I say minute-by-minute? 
[00:30:30]  This is the type of thing you want from your morning show?  This is what you want.  Go out and hire that show.  I'd rather be spanked by a man than play toddler theater.  Hey, pull him down, pally.  I got two good hands.  And then, uh...  What?  Often the lines will have obscene language that is censored out,  leaving many listeners wondering whether they actually do drop their curses  or whether Preston has them substitute other words. 
[00:31:00]  A kid cursing on the radio.  That's outrageous!  How about some of the frequent guests, Opie?  Well, then, really fast, butt-plug karaoke.  Casey Boy, I guess they have a stunt boy.  Every morning zoo type of show has a stunt boy.  Stunt boy.  We'll insert a butt-plug into his mouth,  and we'll sing a line or two from a song.  Callers must figure out what song he's singing.  Oh!  Well, some of their guests, Jose Lucero, and he's a Philadelphia janitor 
[00:31:30]  and the star of What You Say, Jose, which is another little game they do.  What You Say, Jose, the original version of Butt-Plug Karaoke.  Jose, their janitor friend from the building,  performs a spoken word version of a song in his best English,  which in itself is actually an actual challenge.  Ah, it's him just trying this.  And then the listeners have to get out of here. 
[00:32:00]  Frank the Diet Guy, local diet expert and personal trainer.  I'm sure he's on at 8.52 and 39 seconds.  Every Tuesday.  Every Tuesday.  Or whatever.  A meteorologist.  Early morning anchor and field reporter for the Action News.  Terry O'Quinn, an actor and star of the TV series Lost.  Local lunch lady. 
[00:32:30]  She'll discuss the finer points of Philly cuisine.  And a guy from indoor lacrosse.  Are you?  Well, don't forget they do their Camp Out for Hunger.  This is just terrific.  Preston and Steve have for several years held an annual Camp Out for Hunger,  in which both Preston and Steve live in a trailer for one week in December  to raise food for the Greater Philadelphia Food Bank.  Oh, they help the community. 
[00:33:00]  That's just terrific.  Give them a gold star.  Five in ten.  The rules are simple.  When a caller is finally put on the air,  they will be prompted by one cast member to give them five examples of a subject in ten seconds.  Example.  Okay, in ten seconds, give me five Nick Cage movies.  Go!  Despite the apparent ease of this,  the cast has been reduced to asking for five examples of grunts.  Or at worst, it's five seconds of silence.  Thankfully, both of these were one.  What? 
[00:33:30]  What?  Well, that's what he likes.  So it just shows we have a major problem.  If he likes that type of radio, I don't really know what to tell you.  I don't know what to tell you.  You don't understand this show.  You picked the wrong example if you're trying to make a point.  We are so far from that type of radio, I couldn't even tell you.  I couldn't even tell you.  Camp out for hunger.  Months of stunts.  You've got to get things that rhyme, too, Opie.  We need things that rhyme.  We don't have enough rhyming events.  All right, I got one.  Stunts with.  Yeah.  Stunts with.  And then another word. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, wait.  We don't need to do the raunchy stuff.  I apologize.  I apologize.  I don't mean to have an edge.  It's a great idea, though.  Morning show trivia.  That's the way I'd say it.  And then everyone would be in that car going, oh, hello.  I know what that is because he does that note real long. 
[00:34:30]  Shoot yourself.  And get us some heat.  Let's start freezing.  Let's start there.  How about you heat up the studio?  Are they trying to save money on heat, too, around here?  Lord knows we don't have any prizes or anything.  And look at that.  Oh, by the way, I was just goofing.  Okay, relax.  Don't need a whole email about how we discussed trying to get you more prizes.  Relax.  It was a joke.  A joke.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  We ought to just have something that lets everybody know that a joke has been.  Matt, what about this?  I was only joking.  Yeah, there you go.  There we go.  There you go.  Every time we say something, just to keep John happy, we'll play this.  I was only joking.  Then you know it was just a joke.  Then you know it was a joke.  Because the whole guy on guy, that's what corporate wants.  If you didn't realize that was a joke.  Guy on guy, corporate sex, hold on.  I was only joking.  All right, good. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, we beat you up a little bit, but it was a joke.  I was only joking.  It was a joke.  Don't you get it, you moron?  Why would I hit it?  Why would I hit it?  I am Azimuth.  Oh, yeah, and now we've got to talk about why we're in the news today next.  That's just wonderful.  Yeah, those Google news alerts are fun when you plink them down and see certain words attributed to your name. 
[00:36:00]  For the first time in my career, I could see the end of the road.  And I'm fine with it, to be honest with you.  I'm just so annoyed.  I'm fine with it.  I'm so fine with it.  Oh, just wait to hear how we're getting lumped into this fantastic news story.  All press is good press, right?  Yeah.  Not this.  You decide next. 
[00:36:30]  Hear what everyone else is talking about.  O&A Uncut and live.  Continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We're back with the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, I'm in a mood today.  And then, so I get that email last night and I talked about that pretty much all night. 
[00:37:00]  And then I was finally done with that and I decided to Google our names, which I do from  time to time.  Actually, I do it every day.  I get the Google Alerts when I check my email.  It says Google Alerts.  Google Alerts, right.  And you click on it and it shows what news you're in.  You know, it keeps you up to date.  Sometimes you're surprised.  Sometimes you know what it's going to be.  And sometimes you're like, oh, that's surprising. 
[00:37:30]  And then sometimes it's not even us.  It's like, you know, O.P. Johnson is running for office.  And then way down the line it'll say, you know, something like Bill Anthony.  Yeah.  Sometimes it makes you want to hang yourself.  Highlight it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Most of the time it makes you want to just jump out a window because you suck.  Makes me want to choke people.  Some junior high school did a blog about how much you suck.  Yeah.  It was really good and spelled correctly.  It was very accurate.  Yeah, that's something. 
[00:38:00]  They ought to really give me those things up.  Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, what?  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  What?  The person that is talking right now is Robert Kelly.  He's in today because Jim Norton is doing comedy in Lancaster, PA, all weekend long.  So what we do on the Opie and Anthony show, because Ant and I like to have a third or fourth person in studio,  because it's kind of like a clubhouse.  It's kind of like we're hanging out at a bar with our friends.  It's pretty much a show where we can pretty much be playing poker. 
[00:38:30]  It's the same type of thing.  You're playing cards and discussing the topics of the day.  We're just talking.  So because Jim Norton is not here today, we decided to go down the list of people that we like to have on the show when Jimmy's not here.  And unfortunately, everyone else was busy, so we got Bob Kelly.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Are you over-explaining for the sake of the email?  Got to.  Got to over-explain.  I was only joking.  Got to make sure everyone knows everything at every given time.  I was only joking.  At every given moment.  I like the fact that I was the last one on the list, too. 
[00:39:00]  Hey, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What do we got left?  All right.  All right.  Bottom of the barrel.  You've moved up to third place, my friend.  Oh, cool.  I don't want to.  Out of five.  I actually thought I was here because of the website host story there.  Holy crap.  I thought I was filling in for Jimmy because they found it.  They found out, yeah.  Bob, anything else?  Somehow he was involved.  Anything else you want to tell the people about yourself?  They need to know because they can't listen to the show unless they understand everything.  Everything that's going on.  There can't be any bit of mystery or a thing that they maybe should listen maybe for a day 
[00:39:30]  or two to figure out.  You know, God forbid we try to make people listen longer by maybe, you know, getting a piece  here, a piece there.  Yeah.  Why not?  We've been very successful over the years kind of doing that, not playing all our cards at  one time.  The first time I ever heard this show was you, you guys just sitting here talking about  how much this show sucks today and you would not stop.  The show did suck, but you just kept this show and anything you tried to do was like, 
[00:40:00]  that sucked.  And it was the funniest thing I've ever heard on radio because you never hear them ever  being honest and saying, you know, we suck today.  Yesterday was great.  Today we just suck.  And you ended the show going, we'll hope tomorrow is better.  Yeah.  And that's it.  That's why the show is great.  It's a pretty, we try to keep it honest.  We really do.  So we Google our names last night and this lovely story and thank you to the AP.  Thank you, AP, for deciding to run with this today. 
[00:40:30]  Associated Press.  Why are we in this story, really?  Well, I think because it involves a website and it involves the internet being used for something  illegal and the guy is involved with a website that deals with this very program, the Opie  and Anthony show.  Right.  That's why the tie in.  Well, great.  We'll, we'll read the story next because now we got a break again.  You guys take another break?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah, we have to. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Just right.  Didn't we just come back?  Yeah.  I thought we did.  Yeah, we did.  You guys take another.  But you just got into it.  Yeah.  And no naked chicks.  No.  But we have to take a break.  See, we went late.  So there's no naked chicks and we have to take a break.  We went long.  You know, ideally they probably would have liked us to break up our bitching into two  segments.  Two segment bitches.  So, you know, they could sell stuff.  But we decide maybe it's better if we just go with it. 
[00:41:30]  That bitching was sponsored by Mydol.  When your radio hosts are on the rag.  Do we really have to break again?  Yeah.  Yeah.  For how long?  Who knows?  We'll keep it as short as possible.  Who knows?  I wouldn't go anywhere though.  Because you're going to want to hear this story.  There are times the breaks are so long I actually leave the building and go get breakfast.  Yeah, we walk down the street hand in hand. 
[00:42:00]  Like Europeans?  Yeah.  Like European men?  Starbucks a block away.  We're, what, 15 stories up, whatever.  Quick elevator ride.  Walk at our Starbucks.  Come all the way back in.  And we sit down and wait a little longer.  Back to it.  And then we get back into our show.  That's what we do.  Wow.  Oh, by the way, that's a joke.  We don't actually do that.  I was only joking.  We don't actually do that.  I was only joking.  Because that would be crazy.  I was only joking.  Oh, yeah.  See, that's another joke. 
[00:42:30]  I was only joking.  Don't feel like reading emails all weekend.  So I better make sure you know it's a joke.  See, because the joke is that the commercial breaks are long at times.  That we could actually do some other things besides a radio show as we wait around.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:43:00]  Our phone number, 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  We're fired up this morning again.  And I know there's a percentage of people out there that hate when we bitch.  But I don't know what to tell you.  That's what you get with an honest show.  There are people that are angry that come in and do a radio show.  And they're smiling and doing their breaks when they're supposed to and everything.  And got the radio voice on.  And they're talking about, hey, we got the weatherman coming in. 
[00:43:30]  And it's going to be at 730.  We're going to tell you all about the weather.  And meanwhile, the mics go off and they're just miserable and yelling.  We like to bring that to the air just because that's what we do.  Yeah.  So, but we'll move on.  We get to other stuff.  I definitely want to get to this website thing.  Yeah, we will.  This is what a weird, what a weird, twisted story this is.  No, we will.  We got, we got, what were you going to say about?  No, something stupid.  Go ahead.  All right.  Well, no, I mean, just to get everyone on board.  We got another email from the program director of this radio station that I guess is the program 
[00:44:00]  director for the other shows here.  On a board.  And he's the program director for the other shows.  Yeah.  You know, they got to listen to him.  We don't have to listen to anybody.  And this email really hit a nerve, though.  And part of it, I'm reading it again and again and again because that's how effed up I really  am.  Yep.  He writes, as we've discussed many times, your strengths aren't in the raunchy area anyway.  And as I'm reading that, I got to tell you, and I swear to God we didn't set this up. 
[00:44:30]  E-Rock has been going through a lot of the old photographs from back in the day, and we're  throwing a lot of them back up on opianthony.com.  As I'm reading that during the break, I'm looking at a girl, and I forgot all about this.  I really did.  I'm looking at a girl that's completely naked in our old studio.  Not a stitch.  Not a stitch.  Okay, she's got like a scrunchie in her hair, I think, and that's about it.  A scrunchie, okay?  And you may say to yourself, big deal, naked woman in the studio, heard it a million times.  Blah, blah, blah. 
[00:45:00]  But for John to say that we don't need to do raunch and we shouldn't do raunch, we made  our names partly because of some of the raunchy things we did on our radio show.  It's an element of what we do.  Is this like Russian history?  There's parts of our history we're supposed to forget and make believe never happened?  Stalinism.  Are you crazy?  You commie.  The faithful listeners.  You're calling John Minnelli a communist?  Faithful listeners understand the show.  We did raunch, we did nudity, we did edgy stuff, we did very humorous stuff. 
[00:45:30]  Serious stuff, news.  Got serious at times.  It's a whole recipe, okay?  So as I'm reading this about.  He's taking out flour.  As I'm reading about, as we've discussed many times, your strengths aren't in the raunchy  area anyway.  I'm barely listening today, and I'm out of my mind, and I'm sorry for that.  Just keep reading.  Plus, there's really nothing left that radio talent could do.  All right.  We've read all that, and we went up.  But the point I'm making, as I'm reading this again, I'm looking at this naked girl 
[00:46:00]  from back in the day, and like I said, the listener's like, yeah, whatever.  Nudity on the radio.  It's been done a million times, blah, blah, blah.  This girl is nine months pregnant, completely naked in our studio.  Yeah.  That's gross.  We didn't do this?  We didn't do this?  No, it was never done.  By the way, remember why she was brought in?  She wanted us to make the baby come out.  We wanted her to have a baby.  What?  Live on our show.  We wanted to deliver a baby.  That girl.  We wanted to deliver a baby.  So what we had her do was run up and down the stairway in the back hall. 
[00:46:30]  By the way, naked.  Naked.  We had this one stairway that went to, I don't know, the sales area.  Until her water broke.  Was it over at the top of the stairs with a baseball bat?  With a big pair of heavy pair of Doc Martens.  She was running up and down the stairs.  Yeah.  Then we got her to jump rope.  Then we got her to do jumping jacks.  And then our listeners are helping us out.  And they said if she has sex, that could do it. 
[00:47:00]  So then her boyfriend or her husband, I think it was just a boyfriend at the time.  She looks like a Latina, so it's probably just a boyfriend.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, that's a joke, by the way.  Don't want to insult any other Latinas today.  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  She looks like a cave spider.  Well, then the boyfriend or the husband.  I think Obie's touching it.  Obie's feeling her belly.  Look at his face.  Well, that's what you do when you see a pregnant girl.  You want to feel the baby kick.  Do you?  And then she went, right after that shot, she went into another room with her boyfriend 
[00:47:30]  slash whatever, husband, I don't know.  And they had sex.  Yep.  Because that might get the baby moving.  Unfortunately, we failed.  We failed miserably.  Yeah, she didn't have a baby.  She didn't have a baby.  And we were really bummed out.  How old is that kid now?  That kid's got to be like five years old now.  Oh, that's frightening.  Five years old.  And then really fast, and then we'll get to the...  I think you can see pictures of the kid up on that website that that guy...  Let me just say something.  Chicks with nylons make me want to puke. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah.  Nylons.  Ugh.  And here's another thing, because the whole thing about the man-on-man spanking yesterday...  Besides the hotness, yes.  I got the wrong disc.  We got Bob Kelly in studio for Jim Norton today.  Jim's going to be in Lancaster all week.  Well, I'll be...  Bob, you didn't hear the show yesterday, right?  No, I was...  I want you to be Joe Listener.  And I want you to be his...  I swear to God, we didn't set this up ahead of time.  I want you to be really honest. 
[00:48:30]  I want you to close your eyes and listen to this and tell me if it's good radio or not.  Okay?  And we'll even set it up the same way.  Yesterday was Valentine's Day, and Ant and I...  Well, the day before.  The day before.  And Ant and I, we started the bit by going, we have some serious concerns with the Opie and Anthony show.  This is pretty much all we said.  We said, the show's getting really gay.  And at the end of our Valentine's Day show yesterday, we had a guy getting spanked by another guy.  Bare bottom spanking. 
[00:49:00]  It's like, that's romantic.  That's what Valentine's Day is about.  That's what our show has come down to.  So we're beating ourselves up and going, what is wrong with us?  I like it already, though.  Yeah.  And then we brought management into it and going, well, this is the type of thing they obviously like,  because they have no problem when we get guys naked, but they don't want any naked girls.  No girls.  That was a joke, but they didn't take it that way for whatever reason.  I was only joking.  And then we played the audio of a guy getting spanked by another guy. 
[00:49:30]  Okay?  I want you just to listen.  That's all.  That's the setup.  You don't even know who the guy is, who the guy's spanking.  Okay?  We didn't explain any of that, and I guess John Minnelli had a problem with that.  So listen to this clip, and tell me, if you're listening to this show, if you would be entertained by it.  With what we just told you.  That's the only setup we gave.  Anything else we need to add that we did that day?  Okay.  That's all we pretty much said.  And this is what you heard yesterday.  The things about how gay this is.  Wet it up real good. 
[00:50:00]  Don't dry it.  And get a nice flat smack on that.  Game on.  Here we go.  All right.  Other cheek.  All right.  Mind the cup.  What happened?  Are you getting excited?  Why are you hitting the cup?  All right.  Hold on.  That would f***ing hurt.  That's why I hit the cup.  This is real.  That shit is.  All right. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's a half a retard.  He's ridiculous.  Oh, man.  Turn around.  Look what he did to his ass already.  He told me this isn't real.  Take a look.  Oh, he broke it open.  Holy s***.  Your ass is bleeding.  Earl, you get closer.  Touch it.  Earl, look at his ass.  Look at his bloody ass, Earl.  Earl's ready to faint.  Wow.  You s***.  It's bleeding.  Earl, rub his ass, will you?  Now, to be fair, too, there was a whole setup where we talked about Ronnie brought him in 
[00:51:00]  from the Ron Afez show.  We brought him in, and we decided that he needed to take his spanking bare bottom, and then we didn't want to see his, you know what, so we got a cup, like a drinking cup, and he did, you know, whatever.  And then we, you know, and then we got to that clip eventually.  Small details.  That's it.  That's all we did with that bit.  All we wanted to do was play the audio of a man hitting another man's ass with his bare  hand and the reaction. 
[00:51:30]  Who it is, where it is, why it's happening.  It didn't matter.  It's just why are we doing that on our show when we should be doing something with a girl.  Right.  That was it.  That really was it.  We didn't explain any of the players, so Bob Kelly.  So he had a problem that we didn't explain it enough?  I saw you laughing through the whole thing.  I would have to pull my car over this.  Yeah.  His scream.  His scream is this womanly.  He just walked in and found his two babies dead.  Oh, God.  And his wife going down on his uncle. 
[00:52:00]  It's just, it's like, why would you scream?  But then if he saw his, and then he had to put his thing in a cup.  The funniest part is that you get into it, and Anthony's like, listen, put some cream.  Put a lot of cream.  I had to choreograph it a little bit.  Like it's a girl.  It's like you're into it.  As a girl.  As a girl.  See, exactly.  It was that whole, every guy got worked up to the point where you wanted to contribute  and say, do it this way.  And then we listened back and went, why are we doing this? 
[00:52:30]  Do you know why that's funny?  Because it's hard, it would be hard to explain that to another human being why that's funny.  You have to listen to it.  You have to hear it.  When you say, dude, I was listening to the show and they were smacking a guy's ass.  What did you just say to me?  No.  You got to check this out.  That sound.  You bring up a great point, too.  That did.  Didn't it sound like that sound a guy would make if he ran up to a flaming building and  the fireman told him his family was dead?  Yeah, but then he ran in and came out with like a flaming baby.  That's the sound?  No, no.  I've never heard a scream like that. 
[00:53:00]  A flaming baby.  Running up to the house, it's on fire, and he doesn't know if the kids are alive or dead,  but he does see like kids being thrown out the window.  Yeah.  Like, you know, this is the last ditch effort, and you're like, oh, no.  He goes to catch one of the kids.  It's his kid.  But at the last second, he misses, and it plops on the ground like a pizza.  So he goes to catch it.  He gets a good hold, but the skin comes off, and all he's holding is skin and flock.  He's got a shell of his kid. 
[00:53:30]  It's like glue.  When you put glue on your finger and let it dry and then peeled it off.  That's exactly the scream you would make if something that horrific happened to you.  I've never heard a scream like that.  And I have no doubt that that created water cooler talk yesterday.  That's hilarious.  Did you hear Opie and Anthony?  They had like a guy being spanked by a guy?  And that story goes so far.  Huh?  That story goes.  Because another guy goes, dude, some guy was spanking a guy, and then guys were spanking guys?  What show was spanking a guy?  Why would you spank a guy on Valentine's Day? 
[00:54:00]  That's hilarious.  It's just something that would get brought up.  It's too out there to not talk about.  Definitely gay.  But you don't need a huge over-the-top setup.  It's a guy being spanked by another guy.  That's all you need to know.  And you know what?  There was no reason why.  The guy didn't even do anything wrong.  We just knew we'd get a good scream at him.  Sometimes the simplest things work on the radio.  You don't need a huge setup.  Oh, wow.  You mean you'll scream really crazy if you get spanked by another guy?  Ah, bring him in.  That's all you need.  You don't need to get an involved bit or a bet where he loses and get to it. 
[00:54:30]  You just do it.  A bet.  A bet around it.  No.  Just do it and shut up.  It's a hilarious, hilarious guy.  I thought hilarious.  Well, you can't even imitate that scream.  No, you can't.  I thought so.  And like we said when we started this whole bitch, we know when we suck.  I swear to God I left yesterday going, wow, the show was a lot of fun and we got a lot  of stuff out there.  Because he also said that we spent just a ridiculous amount of time on that audio. 
[00:55:00]  And so I got the guys because we really try to stay with the facts.  This is â€“ we only do a three-hour show for CBS radio.  Yesterday on the show, here are the topics.  Mind you, three hours we had yesterday.  Latest Anna Nicole Smith news.  Stern getting engaged.  Eastside Dave audio, which you just heard there, Bob.  Gay or funny because that led into things you've done with your pals that could either be just  something really funny or it could be construed as, wow, that's gay, dude. 
[00:55:30]  I have a couple of those.  You know what I mean?  Like buddy passes out and you got to get the â€“  Start kissing him softly on the lip.  And you put mustard on part of his body.  You got to get a picture of â€“ you know, you got to get a picture of you-know-what near his face.  You know, we've all either done that or been part of that.  So then people call up and they tell us what crazy thing they did with other guys and we decide  if it's gay or funny.  So it kind of faded into that for a little bit.  And then we did what we did for Valentine's Day, morning news, not reporting real news 
[00:56:00]  anymore or having to report some tragic event while they're dressed up for some wacky bit  that they were doing that morning.  Yeah, because the news just does wacky bits now.  JetBlue's story, everyone stuck on the plane yesterday.  Me included.  Then we had the Nicolas Cage interview and then we went over Otto and George's Letterman appearance  with Otto on the phone.  You talked to Nick Cage yesterday?  Yeah.  And then you did Otto and George.  Yeah.  That's nine bits.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  There's nine topics we covered yesterday. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Some longer than others, sure.  But he makes it sound like that's all we did yesterday was the man-on-man spanky.  It's fantastic.  It's not honest.  I'll tell you why that bit is great because, like you said before, it's a YouTube age and  that bit makes you want to go to the website, look at the video, look at the photo.  Could you go, it's bleeding.  You're like, they made it happen.  Oh, it's awful.  Not only do you listen to the show while it's on, you're also going on the internet as soon  as you get home because you can't do it at the office so you get arrested like that guy.  And you're downloading the photos. 
[00:57:00]  You're showing somebody else.  And you send it to your friends.  And you send it to somebody else.  That's a perfect bit.  You post it up on your MySpace.  Perfect bit.  Well, that's where it really-  And it's not the same thing every week.  That's where it continues helping the show.  But I want to stick with the facts that as a radio bit, it got people talking.  It's great.  Like, that guy's screaming like that?  Yeah.  His left cheek was like shot me.  The pictures and video are up on opianethy.com.  When I heard E-Rock, I called him, had to tell him.  I was driving down the street and I heard him scream from what he did. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  I had to pull the car over because I was laughing so hard.  The E-Rock video of him falling into the wall off the toilet when he got his armpit waxed was hysterical.  To hear a woman scream is like, oh my God, what's going wrong?  To hear a guy scream, it's got to be one of the funniest things on the planet Earth.  To hear a guy scream like a woman.  It really is funny.  A guy screaming like a bitch.  Yeah.  We did it to you.  We played your audio of you breaking your knee over and over and over.  You don't really scream.  You're just kind of moaned. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  You were like.  I scream when I got electrocuted.  Dane electrocuted me with a stun gun.  And there's certain things that make you scream.  You know what you screamed like?  Here's Bob moaning when he broke his knee.  That's the sound someone makes when their chute doesn't open and they've fallen and hit the ground.  Like, they don't scream.  They always just, because their lungs are punctured.  You just kind of. 
[00:58:30]  You can only move your head around.  And people ask you, are you okay?  No.  You can't see right in.  You're bleeding from every orifice.  It says, call 9-1.  What'd you do?  Yeah.  Is anything broken?  Can you move your legs?  That's the only answer you get.  What's your name?  What happened?  Can you move anything?  Are you female or male? 
[00:59:00]  That's what you get.  Are you female or male?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  Sorry, Steve.  Oh, wait a minute.  Oh, he had a curse.  Did I hear a curse?  He cursed again. 
[00:59:30]  What?  Did he think something inappropriate?  Wait, what?  Oh, God.  You rock, you curse.  There it is.  When that gets played on YouTube,  five times in a row.  He fell off the toilet.  On YouTube, that plays like five or six times in a row. 
[01:00:00]  That last one, where he fell off the toilet and really screams.  It gets funnier every time you see it.  Each time.  By the fifth time, you're laughing until you're crying.  Look for E-Rock Waxing on YouTube.  There's a long version.  The short version is a lot funnier because they get right to the ripping, the screaming.  Let me tell you something.  That's great.  That has got to be the funniest thing.  And you know why?  The last one, it just comes out of nowhere.  Yeah.  It's like, and you hear him trying to... 
[01:00:30]  It's something a man shouldn't do, you know?  It's so primal.  It's just something funny about that because you know he's trying to man up.  Oh, yeah.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  I'm going to suck it up.  Go ahead.  And that's it.  Do it.  Do it.  Ah!  Ah!  Where did that come from?  Where did that noise come from out of me?  It's so true, man.  You're trying to man up. 
[01:01:00]  You're just like, I got this.  It just comes from deep in.  You don't even know you can make a noise like that.  I'll tell you what he's thinking of.  This is what he's thinking of.  He's thinking of...  He's the expert.  He's thinking about in Roadhouse when he said, pain don't hurt.  When she goes, do you need a...  No, pain don't hurt.  Pain don't hurt.  That's exactly what he's going.  Pain don't hurt.  Yeah, Swayze.  That's right.  Roadhouse.  That's right.  You know what?  Be nice.  Until it's not to be nice.  Pain don't hurt.  Ah!  Ah!  That's a movie.  He falls off a toilet bowl and hits his head on the wall five times. 
[01:01:30]  He's trying to use Tai Chi.  He's like, hang on one second.  Psych himself up for it.  I have to find my center.  Hold on.  A lot of breathing exercises.  He's giving birth.  Okay.  I'm ready.  I got this.  I got this.  I'm ready.  I love that.  I got this.  As it's coming out, you're like trying to shove it back in.  You're like, no. 
[01:02:00]  Half of that scream is like, I'm gay.  No.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  I said, Dane electrocuted me.  He came up with a stun gun and hit me in my stomach.  Let me tell you something.  The scream.  And I don't scream.  You know, I would think that I really, in my brain, would think I'd go, I'll kill you.  Yeah.  Dude, what are you doing?  I'll be.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  Hey.  But certain things, like electricity and getting hair pulled or getting slapped, you scream.  You get shot.  You don't make that sound.  You go, oh, my God. 
[01:02:30]  Yeah.  You get electrocuted.  More concerned.  You get slapped or you get hair pulled out, you scream.  You get stabbed.  You go, ooh.  You can take a stabbing.  Yeah.  But hair getting pulled.  Armpit hair.  Oh, God.  That's like eyebrow hair.  Yeah.  That's like attached.  Is that bad?  Yeah.  Bit of a sensitive area.  Oh, we're going to have to do eyebrow hair then.  Eyebrow hair is like attached.  And you know what?  I'll tell you what.  My girl does that for a living.  Okay.  She does, you know, she does coochies for a living. 
[01:03:00]  Wow.  And yeah.  But there's a certain, she did my ass once.  She gave you a Brazilian waxing?  On my butt.  Because I have like rogue hairs, just, you know, a bunch of them.  But it looks like Larry from the Three Stooges head.  Oh, God.  The top where they used to be hair.  There's still some fuzz.  Just a couple of coarse ones.  Yeah, yeah.  Sticking out in some kind of weird angle.  Yeah, yeah.  That's the problem.  It doesn't even grow right anymore.  What's that about?  All of a sudden it just grows crooked.  What happened to straight hairs?  It goes into like a Dr. Seuss formation. 
[01:03:30]  It just starts out this way.  It goes this way.  And the last...  There's no way to make a roof.  You know what I mean?  The last three inches, it loses its curl.  Yeah.  It just goes straight.  Yeah.  It looks like a question mark.  What happened?  I get the eyebrow hairs like that.  They just go off in their own direction.  Dr. Seuss house.  If she says that you...  Like a lot of these women, these Mexican girls just come in, I'll put wax on this and rip it  off.  I got you.  Wow.  But you have to know. 
[01:04:00]  You have to go to school and know how the hairs go.  It's like cutting a steak.  You know?  If you want to have a rough cut, you cut against the grain.  Yeah.  You have to look at the hairs and put wax there and flip it.  You know?  And there's a certain thing.  In the right direction.  You got to do the right direction.  The hairs go this way.  And you have to breathe.  And then when they rip out, you're supposed to go...  And let it out on the rip.  You can't just rip.  You can't just rip.  You can't just go...  Trying to hold it in.  Girls are nuts that they get that done. 
[01:04:30]  They're crazy.  She tells me some stories about some women that come in there.  It's just...  Oh, really?  It's like they should discover Sasquatch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's just awful.  And she's going to do a waxing.  It costs $800.  We're going to take another break here.  We're going to do another clip from man-on-man bare-bottom spanking.  It doesn't need a setup.  It's just what it is.  It's hilarious.  It's just what it is.  It's the screaming.  We just knew we'd get good screams out of the guy.  That's all it is.  And then we decided to sneak some icy hot onto the guy's hand that was doing the spanking. 
[01:05:00]  Because, you know, you saw the damage it was doing.  It was all opened up and it's like, well, now we've got to add something to the bare-bottom spanking.  He looked like the bad-bottom spanking.  He was slapping alcohol or, in this case, icy hot.  Who was slapping him?  Dr. Hook?  It was Patrick Duffy.  Yeah.  He was slapping him?  Yeah.  The intern that got vomited on.  Is he a big guy?  Because that slaps.  He's got a meaty hand.  It's kind of twisted how well he did that.  It was kind of creepy. 
[01:05:30]  Kind of.  Yeah.  Kind of.  But we'll go to break as, you know, this guy.  I don't know.  Eastside Dave from the Rana Fez show.  Give him a plug for the Rana Fez listeners checking us out today.  Here you go as we go to break.  Wait, what's going on over there?  Just a little alcohol.  I just feel like something bad's going to be real alcohol.  Something bad's going to happen.  We want to keep it clean.  We want to keep it clean.  Off you go.  All right, here we go.  Here you go.  Take it, brother, like a man.  Two in a row.  Go ahead.  That wasn't that bad. 
[01:06:00]  What the f*** is this?  What?  What happened?  Dude.  Oh, you f***.  Oh, f***.  Oh, f***.  Oh, f***.  Icy hot.  We got him with Icy hot.  Icy hot.  We got him with Icy hot.  Oh, f***.  I'm annoying now.  They're full of your pants.  We got him with Icy hot.  What the?  What happened? 
[01:06:30]  Oh, my God.  I f*** fell five f*** different slabs.  They're just coming out of nowhere.  Remember, it's Icy hot.  Don't put water on it.  No.  Last time.  Water and Icy hot.  Yeah, write it out, brother.  Water is the worst thing with Icy hot.  Yeah, it is.  Oh, no.  It's like an activator or something.  No, I just feel uncomfortable.  One more, and then we're done, I guess.  One more snack.  Oh, turn around and take a look at it first.  You're going to be worried about this kid.  Look how bad his ass is.  I can't even turn. 
[01:07:00]  He looks like a baboon.  You have f***ing baboon ass.  Oh, boy.  What's wrong with that?  Yeah, there's something f***ing burning my ass.  What's wrong?  There's something burning my ass.  What?  That was not f***ing water.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:07:30]  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bob Kelly helping us out today.  So here's the story.  Just a weird night.  Between the stupid email from the program director,  and then I Google our names, which I do every day. 
[01:08:00]  Every day or every night, see what's going on.  Because they like to attach us to a lot of news stories.  Which is fine.  This diddy popped off.  Except for this one.  And we've said over the years, you know,  all press is good press.  Except when these words are in front of us.  Yeah, no kidding.  No kidding.  I'm Chris Hansen from Dateline NBC.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[01:08:30]  We've been looking at one of your fan websites.  Let me make this perfectly clear.  We have nothing to do with it.  You make this perfectly clear.  It's like six degrees of Kevin Bacon.  They decided, ah, let's make sure we get Opie and Anthony in the story.  Well, why don't we read the story?  Well, the headline, this is just going to be terrific for everybody.  Website host possessed child pornography.  Yeah, that's the headline. 
[01:09:00]  And, of course, the first line.  Doug out, Doug?  No.  Of course, the first line of the story has to mention Opie and Anthony.  You know, they've done research on people and how they read newspapers and stuff.  And do you know that most people will read the first, maybe second paragraph of every story,  and then it gets to the point and then fades away and then you move on to the next story?  Yeah.  That's a fact.  They've done research, so they make sure they hit you hard in the first paragraph or two,  knowing that most people would stop reading after that. 
[01:09:30]  They got enough info and they want to move on to something else.  Right.  Steve from Bay Show wants to know, were they bathtub pics of the Hughes brothers?  Yeah.  That picture's up, right?  The pictures of you two in the bathtub?  My brother has decided to, like, put all our kid pictures up on his MySpace account.  Really?  And I think there is a picture of all of us in a bathtub together.  Oh, that could be trouble.  All washing each other. 
[01:10:00]  Did you just get done with a softball game?  I have to work, working at the Home Depot.  So I guess there is a picture out there somewhere.  But anyway, so here's the story, and it was picked up by the AP, which is just terrific.  Website host possessed child pornography, a Bronx man who maintains an unofficial fan website  based on the Opie and Anthony radio show.  At least they said unofficial.  Yeah, but usually the first sentence of the story is the most important sentence in a story. 
[01:10:30]  Why do they have to start the story with that?  When I first read it, all I was thinking is, please, officer, I have a job to go to.  Is there any way we can work this out?  Anthony's doing an impression of Steve, the executive producer of the Opie and Anthony show.  Everybody knows that.  I want to make sure everyone is on board.  Why are you explaining?  I was only joking.  I was only joking.  Steve kind of talks gay at times.  Put me in my cell.  I have nothing to do but sit here.  Maybe I'll just sing.  Yes.  Over. 
[01:11:00]  Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba.  That makes me laugh, man.  I love it.  You know Steve really did go to his registry.  He burned a hard drive.  I pity.  He punched.  Get rid of this.  He punched his Dell.  I'll tell you all the fan sites though.  They're all over this story.  And I saw one post that made me laugh really hard because they said that we have a new product  that we were just about to introduce to the Opie and Anthony fans.  Yeah.  And it's the Opie and Anthony magnet.  And someone wrote, it's too bad that this product or whatever isn't coming out until 
[01:11:30]  next week because a bunch of us could have used this today.  And it's a picture of two huge magnets with our logo on it.  That made me laugh really hard, whoever did that.  But anyway, website hosts possessed child pornography.  A Bronx man who maintains an unofficial fan website based on the Opie and Anthony radio show  has been sentenced to four months in jail after admitting to possessing nearly 100 images  of young children involved in sexual activity on his personal laptop. 
[01:12:00]  100.  We have nothing to do with this guy.  He's a fan of the show and he ran a...  We've got us just separating ourselves.  We have nothing to do with this gentleman.  He was an Uber fan.  He ran a website.  Like what?  A lot of our old bits?  It was OAVirus.  OAVirus.com.  OAVirus.com, which is still up.  If you want to check out, maybe you could find a nook and cranny and find some porn on there.  Well, we got kicked off...  I like the whole site.  Well, we got kicked off the radio. 
[01:12:30]  He was one of these guys that kind of kept it going because people were really bummed  out and he started throwing all our old stuff on a website.  Yeah.  And the word got around.  You go here.  You can get your fix of Opie and Anthony until they get back on the air eventually.  That's...  He was pretty huge as far as the fans go.  Especially when we weren't on the air anymore.  Last night, we were sitting around the house and trying to figure out who it is and what  website they're from and Opie's on the phone and the guy's name was Ed. 
[01:13:00]  So it said in the paper, Ed.  And we speculated who it was and Opie said, yeah, oh, they're starting to say that it's  this guy from OAVirus.  And my girlfriend goes, no, his name was Edwin.  And then she went like, oh my God, Ed.  And I get a hitter, like, oh, geez, it is this guy.  Wow.  Yeah.  It went by the name of FedEx, I think.  FedEx, sure.  How do you get caught?  This is my thing.  I get stuff on my...  Well, that's in the story. 
[01:13:30]  This is what makes the story really interesting.  The photos that the defendant has admitted to possessing were actual children who have been  victimized and sexually exploited for no other purpose than to satisfy the prurient  desires of sexual predators.  Queens district.  District Attorney Richard Brown said, this case should serve as a warning to all such  predators that the law enforcement community will do everything within its power to protect  underage children.  Edwin, presently a blah, blah, blah in the Bronx, who worked as a limousine driver, pleaded 
[01:14:00]  guilty on January 9th to possessing a sexual performance by a child before acting Queen Supreme  Court Justice Dorothy Chin Brandt, who imposed the determinant sentence of four months in jail  and 10 years probation.  And he's got to register as a level one sex offense.  Oh, he's got to register.  That's nice.  Did they say...  This makes a big difference to me, too.  Did they say it was boys or girls?  I don't know.  They didn't say.  Here's where it gets interesting. 
[01:14:30]  According to Brown, Edwin's wife, Edwin's wife at the time, discovered child porn on his  personal laptop computer and notified the police.  She turned him in.  The police.  You've got to be kidding me.  She could have just had him.  She could have beat him over the head with the computer when he got home and then just  had him.  Whatever she wanted.  Look, if it was...  Like, this is it.  Oh, that kills me.  I'm going home and throwing my computer out. 
[01:15:00]  Because my girl caught me with a bunch of stuff, too, you know.  Like, I bagged.  I mean, she called me a serial killer.  You know, she...  What was it?  It was all, like, Brazil.  Oh, well, they weren't underage girls.  Well, no.  She's not going to find that stuff.  That was under...  You put those in file...  Like, a file in a file in a file name.  Oh, and they'll never find them there.  Tate file.  Mac 2733.  Oh, God.  Nickel 5. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, because the FBI would never find it.  Yeah.  But that's terrible.  You're kidding me.  The FBI probably have been listening to our show for a while.  Yeah.  And they've probably been checking out the message boards for a very long time.  That's the fact of what's going on with this story.  That's scary.  All right?  I wouldn't care if they searched every computer I had.  Please don't see that.  They ain't going to find anything.  They're going to have my computer tomorrow.  They can't find anything on mine.  I don't give a crap.  I'm a good boy.  According to the guy's lawyer, Morales, or Edwin's wife, discovered a child porn on his personal laptop computer and notified police. 
[01:16:00]  At the time of his arrest on November 10th, Edwin, that the laptop being held by the police was his and that he had possessed it while living at...  All right, whatever.  Edwin also admitted that he maintained a fan website, OAVirus.com, based on the radio show Opie and Anthony, and that he received unsolicited mail. 
[01:16:30]  And that's why probably the FBI has been checking out things for a while, including a CD containing images and video clips of children engaged in sexual activity, which he had downloaded onto his personal laptop computer.  In pleading guilty, Edwin admitted that he possessed more than 95 images on his personal laptop depicting young children less than 15 years of age engaging in sexual acts.  And then finally, the last sentence of the story that most people would never get to, it says Brown, who's Edwin's lawyer,  noted that there was no evidence that either Opie and Anthony or their radio show was involved in the defendant's criminal conduct. 
[01:17:00]  Ah, see?  They let us off the hook, the last effing sentence of the story.  Who's burning discs?  Why couldn't they say that in the first sentence?  Who's burning discs and shipping them out to people?  Oh, my God.  His wife turned him in.  Wife turned him in.  How do you feel?  What?  So there you go.  I was doing research, honey. 
[01:17:30]  I'm doing a documentary.  And AP decided to pick up the story, so it's kind of floating around out there.  It's out there.  It's floating around.  Oh, my God.  Let's go to Angela on Long Island.  Angela.  Yeah, hi.  You're not distancing yourselves at all from this guy.  Are you kidding me?  You're making it sound like your pornography is the same as this stuff.  What?  Angela.  First of all, there was a joke or two by Bob Kelly.  Absolutely.  We're not defending this guy. 
[01:18:00]  I was only joking.  Are you kidding me?  We're not defending the guy.  Angela.  What are we supposed to do?  Make a statement?  Make some kind of phony statement?  I would like to say, don't condone.  I think it's obvious that whatever this guy was doing, it was of his own accord.  You're talking about your own pornography and how your wife won't find out.  Oh, yeah.  What about our own pornography?  You might want to just distance yourself a little bit more. 
[01:18:30]  Wait.  What's wrong with having pornography on your computer, though?  I have nothing against pornography as long as it doesn't involve children.  Well, it doesn't.  Did anybody say we had?  Nobody said they had pornography.  Bob said if anybody did have it, you should hide it in, like, some kind of files where  your wife isn't going to be able to pop up pics of the kids and say, we don't have any  kids, and then Bob opened the folder and see all those.  He's saying perhaps this guy was stupid.  Again, I was joking about it.  I mean, when you have...  I was only joking.  Exactly. 
[01:19:00]  When you have porn on your computer and you're trying to hide it from your girl, you don't  leave it on your desktop porn.  Whether it's legal porn or illegal porn.  Yeah, you put it under...  I just said that you put it in a folder and a folder and a folder and you name it dumb  names so she can never get onto it.  And you say that's advocating child pornography?  I did not say advocating.  Well, who wrote that there?  I was...  Huh?  I was looking at the phone screen.  I didn't use the word advocating.  I said that you were not distancing yourself.  I think it's pretty obvious we are. 
[01:19:30]  I mean, you know, I was really, really surprised when I found out who it was because the guy  seemed, you know, pretty normal to me.  The little contact I had with the guy.  He sounded like...  He seemed like a normal guy.  You know, I was kind of a loner, but...  I saw him all the time.  Yeah.  Never seemed to whack me.  Always happy.  I saw him around kids.  He never seemed to look a little weird at him.  I mean...  He was dressed in a clown suit and had a bag of dum-dums.  Seemed like a bag of dum-dums.  Yeah, listen to yourself.  Shut up.  Angela.  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Will you stop listening to yourself?  Are you trying to assess...  I'm listening to you guys.  No, you're turning up your radio to...  Wow, I want to critique myself as it's going down.  I sounded good.  I showed them.  Why don't you wait for the phone call to be over with?  There's enough delay.  You'll hear most of it.  You married, Angela?  I said about five words to your 105.  You married?  Ooh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got a computer at home?  Yeah.  You going to check it now?  Excuse me?  You going to check it?  Uh, I don't have time. 
[01:20:30]  You don't have time, do you?  No, I don't.  Go into your husband's program files, okay?  And anything named win or something like that, go in there and keep digging and you'll find  that file I was talking about.  Win.  Just go into the search feature and put .jpg.  Exactly.  And just see whatever comes up.  Yeah, this guy is effed.  He's going to jail for four months for child porn?  Anything like first underscore time?  Things like that you might want to check into. 
[01:21:00]  And you know, child pornographers aren't that popular in prison these days.  No.  Not like the old days, right, Bob?  What are you talking about these days?  You know, in the old days, they embraced them.  Well, Edwin's wife did the absolute right thing.  I just wanted to add that.  Yeah.  All right, Angela.  Yeah, of course she did.  You think so?  Thanks, guys.  You don't?  No, I'm just...  I asked you.  Relax.  You are defensive.  Listen, Rosie O'Donnell.  I'm just asking you a question.  Do you think... 
[01:21:30]  So if you found child pornography on your guy's computer, you'd rat him to the cops.  You wouldn't go to him and go, what are you doing?  Why don't you get help?  You wouldn't go, hey, go get help.  You need help.  You're a sicko.  I'm going to divorce you.  You need to go get therapy and try to get your stuff together, or I'm going to rat you  out to the cops.  You just go right to the cops and throw him in jail and ruin everything, knowing that,  you know what?  This isn't something that people do because they're healthy.  He's a mental patient.  He needs help.  Well, the child porn is a tough one.  I got to be honest.  He'll get help in prison.  Yeah, he's going to get a lot of help in prison. 
[01:22:00]  It just sounds to me like Angela perhaps still has that light in her eye from the uncle's  flash cube going off.  Maybe...  Exactly my point.  Maybe there was a little problem there.  Angela's a little hypersensitive.  Yeah, exactly.  Child porn's a rough one.  I mean, exactly.  That's my point.  He put his finger...  Anthony just put his finger on it, though.  Well, so did my uncle.  There's no defending it.  We're not trying to defend it.  You would be insane to sit on any program and try to defend child pornography. 
[01:22:30]  Exactly.  If it came off that way, Angela...  I was only joking.  No, you know, your child porn are the biggest scumbags on the planet, but still, if you  know, if my wife turned me in, that's pretty, you know...  The wife turned you in.  Oh, that's...  The wife.  Isn't that some of the vows?  Huh?  For better, for worse, sickness, health, kiddie porn, regular porn.  Nothing like that.  And the vows, we wrote our own vows.  If I catch you, you get one break.  You get one shot.  You get one shot.  I hit you in the gut with the laptop. 
[01:23:00]  All right, Angela.  Bye, guys.  All right.  Thanks.  Yeah, I mean, the child porn thing is a rough one.  Yeah, it's a tough one, but what are you going to do?  I was like...  I read that last night, like, what?  Yeah, it's bad.  What?  This guy wants to know, is this going to affect OA virus, the site?  Yes.  There's no owner.  It's now one of those rudderless ships cruising the internet ocean.  Last I checked, it was up there.  Yeah.  But who in their right mind is going to download any file?  He's just an innocent fan. 
[01:23:30]  What does this say?  Great.  O-O-O-N-A in studio with Greg Brady.  God, all my friends told me...  Let me download that.  All my friends told me about the homeless shopping spree.  Oh, I could go to this site and download...  Oh, that's terrific.  Who's crazy enough to download anything from there?  Homeless shopping spree.  But what's this?  What's this extra file?  That site is just sitting there.  What's this?  Lolita underscore takes it. 
[01:24:00]  That site is just sitting there in an ocean, and even the sharks aren't going to touch it.  Yeah, there's a lot of those websites that are just abandoned ships on the internet ocean,  where they've been there forever.  Just no one at the helm.  They're there just clogging up the internet, bumping into other sites.  That's one of them right now.  Unless he gets an hour break a day in jail to go to update his site.  Excuse me.  Can I update my site?  I'll help you with your taxes if you let me update my site. 
[01:24:30]  I'll help you with my tax.  Can I fix the roof?  I need some helpers and some beer.  I'll tell you right now.  For all the people that heard about this story and went to the site after reading the story,  you're just nuts.  You are nuts.  I want people to know, yeah.  I want to check it out and see if the site's still working.  Really.  I want people to know also, though.  You're going to be getting a knock, knock, knock.  You can download Opie and 12-year-old Gary, and it is a safe file.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Just an innocent discussion of hockey with a child. 
[01:25:00]  A little fan of the show that's now probably 20-something years old.  27.  Type in hockey with a child.  Hockey with a child.  It comes up with that, like 19,000.  That's a code word for something on the porn.  Yeah, I checked out hockey.  That's awful.  Just type in hockey with a child.  Look, you know, all kidding aside, child porn, that's a rough one.  That's what I take a kid.  That's a rough one.  Ah, forget it.  It's a rough one, man.  There's no defending it, the guy.  Absolutely not.  That's bad.  The guy obviously has his share of problems. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah, dude.  Now he's in the joint for four months, and then he's got 10 years of probation, and he's  got to register as a sex offender.  A lot of people are saying he got a light sentence, though, only four months.  Four months is a light sentence.  You know what it is?  If you have it on you, and there's no record that you were distributing it, or, like, the  people that actually distribute this stuff, those are the people that get the big-time sentences.  If you have it on your computer, and there's no record that you're trading these things, 
[01:26:00]  you're going to get a lighter sentence.  I think it's the guy's first offense, also.  And 10 years probation, and registering as a sex offender?  All right, he's doing four months in prison, which ain't going to be no treat, but...  Then you're done.  Because you know you can't stop.  You know he can't stop.  And once you're caught, these guys get caught, they get caught again.  Oh, they'll get caught again.  They'll be watching him.  They'll be watching him.  You can't...  This guy isn't going to...  He just don't quit.  And he's going to have...  That's cigarettes.  And you're going to, like, you know, Google map his... 
[01:26:30]  Oh, his house?  Your neighborhood, and...  You can Google all the little red dot over your house.  The red dot.  What is that?  Oh, there's sites where you can...  What?  You don't know about that?  No, what is that?  See all the sex offenders in your neighborhood.  At this point, it's a game.  I forgot the site, but you put in your address, and you see all the creeps that live near you.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It's all dots.  Oh, my God.  It's like your car parked in front of one of the houses.  I want to get all my friends' names and see if there's dots on their houses.  The Kelly house.  Oh, Jesus.  It's kind of creepy, though, when you just put your address in, and you see a few dots pretty close. 
[01:27:00]  You're like, holy...  You're surrounded by red dots, and then you fill up.  Wow.  I didn't know who...  You're going to get that site.  That's amazing.  Yeah.  This guy's going in for four months.  Four months.  That's nothing.  Yeah.  And he's going to be in solitary for the proving most of the time.  Yeah, you think they'll separate him?  They got to.  For four months?  Oof.  If they put him in population, he's going to get killed.  The site is mapsexoffenders.com. 
[01:27:30]  Have fun with that one if you haven't yet.  And it's a white guy, right?  It's got to be a white guy.  It's an ONA virus.  Yeah, it's a multicultural type of guy.  He's a black guy?  Is he?  Well, he's a moralist.  So he's got a little Spanish in him.  A little Hispanic.  It looked like he was that Spanish, so he's got a little something else probably as well.  I don't know.  I don't even remember what he looks like.  Isn't Edwin more of a â€“ what type of name is that?  Edwin?  That could be â€“ with Morales, that could be Spanish.  Sounds like from the show Lost.  Edwin.  All right.  So we got to see that last night. 
[01:28:00]  That was just terrific.  That was a treat when your name pops up in a kiddie porn story.  Oh, my God.  It's wonderful.  And the dopey proud moment.  This is why I hate the media.  They attached our â€“ made sure they attached our names to this story nice.  Twice.  Twice.  Twice.  Yeah.  At the beginning and the end.  Well, no.  There's one, two, three mentions in this version of the story.  And the last sentence is where they let us off the hook, like basically tell everyone we have nothing to do with this.  Because of the fact that he was a fan of the show and had an unofficial website. 
[01:28:30]  All this is well and fine.  But I am now looking at Pal Talk and I do see that Map of Hawaii has joined the program.  I'm looking at the lovely girl of Map of Hawaii.  Do we even know their names, first names or anything?  No, no, no.  No?  Keep it totally anonymous?  Yeah.  She's laying in bed.  And apparently today is supposed to be the day that they go for a sexy estate.  Yeah.  By having some type of relationship on Pal Talk. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  And we get to watch.  And other people that have Pal Talk get to watch.  Looks like someone else has decided that it's smart to have cameras in studio.  Where'd she go?  While they're doing their show live.  Oh, my God.  She just went away?  She'll be back.  Yeah.  Isn't that great?  Somebody else decided it's a great idea to have cameras in the studio and make people pay for them and have it update every five seconds.  I invented the stinky cam, Robin.  That's pretty much it.  He invented the camera that updates. 
[01:29:30]  He invented 1995 webcam.  What Howard is going to claim that he invented and tell the whole world.  It's part of the revolution.  The version he's doing, we did five years ago.  Five years ago.  Five years ago.  So don't be fooled by his bull crap when it hits the papers.  It's on fmqb.com if you want to read about it.  More money dumping into his pockets.  Let's get out of here for a bit.  Hear what everyone else is talking about. 
[01:30:00]  O&A Uncut and Live continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit xmradio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  We got a big star on the phone. 
[01:30:30]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show, by the way.  Trying to shove poo down my throat.  You gullet.  My gullet.  Let's say hi to Bob Saget.  Good friend of the show.  Bob.  Bob.  What's going on, man?  Not much.  It's hard to wake up this morning.  My little throat hole closes up.  Are you in L.A.?  You guys are very kind.  I want to thank you, by the way.  You sent flowers and everything when we had a rough week a couple weeks ago.  Yeah, sorry to hear about that. 
[01:31:00]  That's a drag.  We don't like people to know that we have a sensitive side, Bob.  Oh, I apologize.  They were exploding flowers.  That's the funniest kind you could ever send.  Yeah, actually, you were supposed to be on our show to promote the Penguin movie.  March of the Penguins.  Hello.  Farce.  Farce.  Farce, yes.  It's a hard word.  It's a hard word.  What do you add?  Farce of the Penguins.  I was bummed for you because I thought the movie was going to be in theaters.  Yeah.  Well, we were bummed at first as well, and then we realized we would have been in like 50 theaters. 
[01:31:30]  And so we said, let's do it hard and hit the ground with college audiences and stuff.  Well, Bob, I'm not going to lie to you.  When I found out it wasn't going to be in theaters, I'm like, oh, boy, here's a bomb.  Because that's usually the case.  Right.  But I grabbed one.  We failed upward.  We're pretty happy.  No, I grabbed a copy.  I took it home.  I happened to have a lot of people up that weekend.  We sat around.  We watched it.  We were laughing our asses off.  Here you go. 
[01:32:00]  Now I'm sending the flowers back to you.  You're so nice.  No, I'm not kidding.  Because then I was surprised.  I'm like, wow, this should have been in a theater.  It's much better than Norbit.  Well, you know, a couple of the Penguins get fat like Norbit.  But it's Bob Saget and Bob Saget starring in.  Yeah, if you had an extra fat penguin, then of course they would have picked up the movie.  Stupid fat movies.  People like it.  It's doing really well, which is a real relief to me and makes me really happy that at least I didn't waste a complete year of my life. 
[01:32:30]  It's the type of movie I was watching.  I'm going, you know what?  I need to start smoking pot again.  Oh, so it advocates drug use.  I don't even think you've got to smoke it because they've got pot pills.  I think you could chop it up.  Pot lollipops.  It definitely has a pot feel to it.  Man, this is really funny, but man, I want to see this movie again really high.  You could chop up pot pills and put it in old people's food. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  And you don't have to smoke it.  You could just know that you're doing it to them.  And then you could leave them alone for a lot longer.  Yeah, by the window.  Unsupervised.  Yeah, they chose a window.  Thrilled by a squirrel standing there.  Unsupervised.  Yeah, and Bob was supposed to come in to promote Farce of the Penguin, and we got Louis Black instead, which was a treat because we haven't had him on the show in a while.  And you just got bad news and had to get back to L.A.  And, you know, we're really sorry to hear that.  I really appreciate it. 
[01:33:30]  I'm sorry that you guys do have a heart.  And I'll do whatever I can to make sure people know what buttholes you really are.  Yeah.  Was it unexpected, or?  Well, I knew I had to.  Actually, Harry Mandel called me, and I said, you know, I was on Conan the minute that he died.  And how he said it, was it expected?  I said, yeah, I knew I was going to be on Conan.  He said, yeah, that's harsh talk.  Of course, to bring everyone aboard, it was Bob's father there, so. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, God.  No, it's been a while.  He had some really crappy stuff happen to him, you know, the circulation, and they had to do some, they took some stuff off of him, and he was yelling, now I can buy shoes half off.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  You're making everybody uncomfortable, Bob.  Sorry.  Sorry, it's like 5.20 in the morning, I figured I'd just go there, you know?  Ed and I actually talk about this with our show.  When you're having a weird show or a slow show, you're like, you know what, screw it all.  I'm going to just start admitting some crazy stuff that's going on in my life. 
[01:34:30]  I'll talk about my dead dad or something, just to keep the show rolling along.  Yeah, we brought that up.  I'll tell you.  I'm like, I don't know, I'm Butterfly Express with a rocket pack into the bottom of the stadium.  I'll tell you what you do, though, because after a few years, of course, it gets easier.  And then, you know, at first, you get a little nostalgic, and you feel that part of your youth and your innocence and everything is gone.  But then as time goes on, like now, it's been, what, like 12 years my father's been dead? 
[01:35:00]  And I talk about how he used to drive around drunk with us kids in the car.  Right.  You start remembering those things.  It's like, Jesus Christ, that guy was a madman.  I don't even, I don't know my father.  Were you close with him?  He was out in California.  He decided when we were about, I was about, I guess, 11 or so, he decided he wanted to be a cowboy.  So he went out to California.  Like the village people?  No, not like the village people type of cowboy. 
[01:35:30]  But that's an alternative also.  But, no, he decided he just wanted to move out to California, Southern California, buy a horse, and be a cowboy.  And that's what he did.  And I went out to live there with him for a while, and it was fun as a kid.  You know, no responsibilities.  You're just kind of hanging out, riding horses, drinking at a very young age, partying.  And then you reach a point where, I think I was about 15, and I looked around and said, hmm, I'm really going to end up nowhere if I stay here. 
[01:36:00]  And I came back to New York.  But got some great, you know, great fond memories of the complete irresponsibility of my father and what fun that is for a kid.  Wow.  So when he died, were you there, or did you go?  No, I was here in New York.  So did they have a covered wagon funeral?  Yeah, it was one of those covered wagon things.  They brought him back.  It took three months for them to bring him back to New York by Conestoga Wagon.  Food was in metal kettles. 
[01:36:30]  Right.  That's the only way to go.  Right.  Fire.  A grave site with, like, a piece of wood, and you dug it with a piece of wood.  A simple wooden cross on Boot Hill.  Just rocks on top.  We did his whole thing.  We did his tombstone in Velcro because, you know, got a lot of death in our family.  We got to be able to move.  Oh, so they got to be able to move him around?  Yeah, I got to.  And play musical tombstones.  That's a great idea, actually.  Yeah, Bob.  The wind stopped blowing.  Let's change the stones.  We both lost our fathers, Bob. 
[01:37:00]  Ugh.  It's just a lot of fun.  And I was actually there when my dad died.  I highly, highly recommend to the people out there that you don't go through that part of it.  It sounds like a great thing.  In the room?  I was in the room.  Did you shoot him?  Jesus.  He shot me.  I was in the room.  I picked up the pillow with my own hands.  You know, I didn't even think of that.  It's like, dude, I was in the room, and I recommend you don't do it. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, it was the pillow.  I just put it up for his face.  I let defuse myself.  Let me tell you, I mean, the people will do what they're going to do out there, but I highly recommend you don't do it.  It's not as romantic as they like to show you in movies.  No, huh?  Oh, boy.  Wow.  That's got to be brutal.  Wow.  I'd rather just get a bad phone call.  Why can't you just be driving across the country in an adult diaper looking for the one you love? 
[01:38:00]  That's all you need, right?  Yeah.  That's all you need to do.  Well, I'm sure you don't want to talk about your dead dad today there, Bob.  No, but it's weird.  Watch this segue.  He actually passed away the day Farce of the Penguins opened.  Really?  Yeah, which was, I think, good for the movie.  A good omen.  He was a workaholic guy.  He was kind of this guy that refused to be Willie Loman, you know?  Really?  And he had a lot of hard stuff, so he died.  He would have died when he was 42, and so he lived to 89, and he was hilarious. 
[01:38:30]  You know, you guys, when he would listen to you, you would find him to be your kind of guy.  89, wow.  Wait, why was he supposed to die at 42?  Two heart attacks.  He wasn't supposed to, but he almost died.  He was in the hospital for six months, and they started him on Coumadin, one of the first people on heart medicine.  Yeah, the Coumadin is rough.  My dad was on that.  Yeah, right, because that thins your blood, so then you go and bang your head, and next thing you know, you're a rainbird.  What the hell? 
[01:39:00]  Thank you for describing how my dad died.  Thank you, Bob.  I really needed to hear that one more time.  Oh, man.  See what happened with my dad?  Oh, Jesus.  My dad was in a really bad accident, and everyone else survived, but because he was on the Coumadin, oh, they can't control it.  I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  All right, it's okay.  That's really true?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, I didn't know that.  He talked all the way to the hospital and went into a coma because you can't stop the bleeding when you're on blood thinner.  I mean, it was a horrific accident, but a lot of us are thinking he might have survived if he wasn't on the Coumadin. 
[01:39:30]  Well, why didn't you put your finger on a pressure point?  Yeah, that's going to work.  Get my belt.  Yeah.  Well, I won't dwell on it, but at my dad's funeral, my friend got up to give a speech because he loved my dad.  And he said, Ben passed away Tuesday afternoon.  Tuesday morning, the last thing he was watching was Bob's movie, Farce of the Penguins.  And he remembers yelling to his nurse, please, someone, for the love of God, turn this off. 
[01:40:00]  So then I walked out.  At my own dad's funeral, you know, my dad laughed at this stuff.  This is who my dad was.  Yeah.  I walked out and said, you know, I knew my movie was killing, but I had no idea to what level.  And then I said, I killed my own father.  Oh, that's terrible.  It was terrible, but it was like, it was fine because it was him.  Yeah.  That's cool. 
[01:40:30]  Well, Bob, every Saturday morning, because I DVR'd, I watched One Versus 100 with my morning coffee.  You've been amazing this whole time.  You've been literally like the one.  You've been like Neo.  You're like.  No, you went, I got to promote this thing.  Bob's on the show.  Then you watched it.  And then you went, I like this thing.  And now Saturday morning, you're watching it.  Yeah, we're pretty honest.  We'll like BS with people.  But then when it comes right down to when we actually watch like Farce of the Penguins  or watch One Versus 100, we're going to give our honest opinion. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  And I love One Versus 100.  It's easy TV.  You're sitting around just kind of getting your day going.  They've got to get it out of Friday nights, though.  Yeah, that's what they keep it there because it's not a big watch TV night,  and yet it becomes its own little battle.  They told me that we're the number five show for all of NBC shows, you know, for all of them.  Yeah, they definitely should move it up into a nice, you know, slot for you.  Yeah, tee it up into like a Wednesday night where no one will be able to compete against it.  Yeah, absolutely.  Absolutely. 
[01:41:30]  But not against the Super Bowl because it could take a punch.  Hey, is anyone ever going to win that million dollars?  I can't say, but I'm going to rig it.  Oh, there you go.  You really should rig it.  I can't tell your audience, but definitely because I'm going to set it up illegally.  Yeah.  You work the mob really well.  That's what makes the show really good.  Really good.  It's really, and there's some nice people in it, too.  They're not all a bunch of nerd-burgers, you know?  Yeah.  Should we explain One Versus 100 to keep everyone on board? 
[01:42:00]  No, got to keep everybody in the know.  It's one guy versus a hundred, and they're all answering the same question, and you as  the contestant, you answer the question, and the mob answers the question, and if you get  it wrong, that part of the mob goes away.  Is it actually the mafia is involved in the program?  A couple guys.  Because I hear the mob.  I think it's the mafia.  And funny you should say that, and I will prove that I watch One Versus 100.  He had a few mob members in the audience.  Really?  Actual gangsters.  Although they look like they may have been from casting, Bob.  They threatened me. 
[01:42:30]  They were not.  One of them actually made spaghetti sauce, so he's kind of a caricature of himself.  Yeah.  But they really were people that had been indicted by judges, and they were on the show  with a bunch of TV judges, like Judge Brown.  Yeah.  So he had TV judges and real mobsters.  And mobsters.  But the real mobsters looked exactly how mobsters would look if you're watching them, you know.  The Sopranos or something.  Exactly.  Well, most of them live in like Palm Springs now or somewhere in Ohio, and they really  are, they look perfect, you know, but they really have done that stuff, which has to do 
[01:43:00]  with either, you know, taking care of someone's father where they're not really needed it.  Right.  Right.  Those are great shows a couple weeks ago.  It was a regular contestant, someone in their 30s or early 40s, whatever, and they took  on a mob of kids.  Right.  And I'm like, this guy's obviously going to win a million dollars, right?  That guy was mean, right?  And this is how smart the writing is on the show and how they, you know, set up the, they  make the questions interesting enough where it's kind of different than Jeopardy and all  that other crap.  But the first couple of questions, it was questions that kids would have no idea about. 
[01:43:30]  What was it?  The Kitty Corner.  They had a question about Kitty Corner.  What does that mean?  And then kids that are all...  A file on FedEx's computer?  Right.  No?  Where they're going to put these kids so they don't get it right.  Yeah, and obviously kids don't know because that's an old, that's an old school term.  So half of them got it wrong and you're like, wow, he's already knocked out, you know, half  the mob.  And then they slowly seg into questions that kids would know over adults and that's when  the game came out.  Ah. 
[01:44:00]  Kind of interesting, so.  Right.  There's no, no questions about circumcision.  Yeah.  None of those kids really knew about it.  They start crying when you tell them.  The best place to hide a booger.  Underneath the hood.  Hey, Bob, getting back to your dad, were you guilted into anything?  You know, setting up the arrangements for his afterlife?  No, we didn't do any of the afterlife.  There was no psychic surgery.  No, they basically hinted to us like, look, you know, you got the wood box here, but if 
[01:44:30]  you want your dad taken care of in the afterlife, we got this fine, fine one over here for a  couple extra thousand.  What a car, pal.  Dude, there's parents, we've been through a lot of loss, so, you know, they lost a lot  of kids.  It's really sad, my family's life.  So we go to the home, it's just my mom and I, my nephew wasn't there, because I said,  I'll take care of this.  We go there, they show you these, literally, the coffin for the silver surfer.  The only reason to be buried in this jet pack, this thing, it's pure silver, is if you're 
[01:45:00]  going to be launched into space.  Yeah, Spock.  You look like shooting out, like Spock.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you're going to be launched into space.  The Genesis.  And you're going to be in orbit for the rest of eternity.  Yeah, sure.  And it's flame retardant, in this case, there's a fire underground.  And there's a plasma TV inside.  What are they, burying you over a Pennsylvania coal mine that's still smoldering from the  1800s?  Dude, you're really going to need this.  He could burn up. 
[01:45:30]  The planning of the funeral pissed me off on, I wanted to strangle the guy.  He's showing us.  I didn't think, that would be ironic, his family would be sitting there trying to pick  out a coffin, because you choked him.  And making you look like a douche, like, and this one's waterproof.  And so, well, this is, that one's going to leak.  And then, and then even the lighting on each coffin, like the cheaper ones, it's like  the, they haven't really changed the light bulbs in that part of the room.  And then, and then like the coffin that Bob just explained, it's like, oh, nice and lit  up and bright and cheery and heavenly. 
[01:46:00]  The Price Club has coffins.  You can, you know.  Price Club.  You can go to Home Depot and just make a coffin.  And pine, few nails.  You can take a bag like Amadeus and just drop it in the ground on top of 19 other people.  Yeah, but they show you, they, they, they use the guilt and all that.  It's like, come on, man.  We're going through a tough time already.  I don't need a sales pitch.  You don't want any leakage.  Then they say, you know, the, the marker, do you want to, and then I wanted to, I went,  okay, this is really sad.  I got a sister there.  I got my dad there.  My mom's going to be there. 
[01:46:30]  I said, I'm 50.  What's the real estate around here?  Oh, we can't get anything near there.  I said, well, give me the silver one.  Launch me into a place you can take me.  They actually told you there's no room for you.  There's nowhere to bury me.  Here with your loved ones.  And it's nice.  It overlooks like Disney.  Maybe they'll bury me in front of the main offices there.  Nice.  All right.  I worked for them.  I think whoever, whoever you worked for that let you go, you should be buried in front of 
[01:47:00]  their offices.  Have to be reminded of you every day.  Every day.  With your thermos as a marker.  Here lies.  All right.  Well, we're glad you're doing all right, Bob.  And thank you.  And that was very cool, Louis Black, to get my back like that.  Yeah, it was good seeing him again.  Oh, are you talking about the show or are you two hooking up?  Uh, well, he's going to get your back.  Nothing?  Hold it.  Okay.  Thought I'd throw a gay joke in there. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Lighten it up a bit.  I put my pinky in his butt, but that had to be good.  Oh, okay.  Oh, there you go.  That's nothing.  That's just called a friend.  I was just doing etiquette.  That's a good friend.  That's all.  That's right.  You hang up on Bob Saget?  You hung up.  You hung up on Bob Saget.  His father died.  His father died and you hung up on him.  I'm about to end nice and neat.  It was such a nice segment and you just douched him.  Enough about his dead dad.  Oh, no.  Right.  Right. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, gosh.  You're making me turn into the hole of the show.  Oh, Opie.  If we're lucky enough, it'll happen to all of us.  Enough.  Yeah, you're special because your dad died.  Oh, my God.  Bobby's in the mood today, baby.  From the second the show opened.  Is he back?  There he is.  Hey, Bob.  I'm two gallows.  I had two gallows.  Jesus.  You inadvertently got hung up on.  We're sorry.  Yeah, I mean, there was a gasp all over the radio audience, but the reality is I did just  mess up. 
[01:48:30]  I didn't mean to hang up on you, Bob.  You guys so freaking doom and gloom catapulted.  Jesus, kind of bringing the show down.  Let's go back there.  I'm really sorry, but then you started going off on your...  People do pass away sometimes.  Yeah, occasionally.  We hear rumor.  We have a shared experience.  That's all.  Well, if you hang up right now, I'll know you meant it.  No, no.  Bob, don't tempt me.  Don't tempt me, Bob.  Bob, you know what an ass he is.  Come on.  Stop.  Don't do this to me.  Where's Opie?  Why don't you hang up on us? 
[01:49:00]  That would be appropriate.  You hang up on me.  You hang up on my father.  Oh.  Don't tempt me, Bob.  No.  Where's Opie?  No, Bob.  Don't do it.  It's like...  Don't let me promo my Penguin movies.  It is doing really well.  Yeah.  Yeah, well...  And if it had come out in theaters, we might have been shooting deer in those theaters.  And then if it came out in theaters, maybe your dad would be alive today.  That might have been the last thing that put him over the edge.  He was feeling...  You know, I understand how dads follow careers, and maybe that really, really bothered him 
[01:49:30]  that you weren't going to be in theaters.  That's nice.  You guys are going at it with your dead dad.  That's great.  But you can't keep it in the stores.  You know something?  You know something, though?  Let me throw this out, and you could all feel better about yourself.  Well, my father died three months before I became a radio guy, so never even...  Only saw me as a construction worker.  Never saw the success I would attain in radio. 
[01:50:00]  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Can I share something with you?  Huh?  Can I share something with you?  Yes, yes, Bob.  The Friars of the Penguin DVD is a little piece of my dad in every package.  Oh, jeez.  Because I love the fans.  He wanted to...  He said...  He wanted to see this thing go everywhere.  I said, okay.  Wow.  Whatever you want.  That must have...  That must have been hard for you to... 
[01:50:30]  It's expensive, because you know you've got to do it like the nicotine patch.  You've got to stick it in every one.  It's got to be very thin, yeah.  There's little patch on the front.  That's a part of my dad's.  Oh, that's very nice of you.  That's very sweet.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, that's just the way.  It's fitting with that getting launched into space idea.  Oh, wow.  Dead dad humor.  Oh, this is fantastic.  It went from kid porn to dead dad humor.  Wait till we see...  My favorite moment of calling you this morning was when I suddenly had you not on the line. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, all of a sudden, you were just hung up on.  But you sent me flowers, and there's two things I can take that to my heart with, which is,  one, thank you for caring about my dad.  And the other thing is, when I come in, we were going to hook up as men.  That's just hot.  You know, when you're grieving, and a guy sends you flowers...  Yeah, men.  ...that's your heart.  You know what?  Just men sending each other flowers.  And I've got to tell you, Bob, it's not going to be gay, because, you know, we lost our dads.  Now, it's not gay if you lost your dads, and you just need a little comfort. 
[01:51:30]  And you can kiss another guy while you're saying your father's names.  No, the kissing makes you gay, Bob.  You know what?  Nothing makes you gay.  You just are gay.  Nothing makes you gay.  Maybe, you know, some old dude when you were a kid made you gay.  In the closet.  But you had to continue it.  Right.  After the guy with the overalls never came back.  Right, right.  You just are.  You are now.  Yeah.  Thank you. 
[01:52:00]  All right, Bob.  All right.  Well, thank you guys for talking to me.  No problem, Bob.  There's no therapy to get me through the day now.  We would love to talk about your dead dad all day, but we've got other things to get to here.  Trade stories.  Enough.  Enough.  Trade tragic stories of our dead dads, but, yeah.  I thought the flowers would be enough, but, man.  Trying to bring back the funny.  Jesus.  Thanks for the flowers.  Here's 40 minutes.  Really?  You get to, you know, go back to bed, and we have to bring the funny back into the show now.  No, I'm going to have to dig for worms now.  Oh.  All right. 
[01:52:30]  Now I'm hanging up on you.  Bob.  Sorry.  I'm throwing fishing.  Oh, okay.  That makes sense.  All right.  You got it.  All right.  What are we promoting today, Bob?  Farce of the Penguins is in stores.  They can't keep it in.  It's doing really well.  It really is a very good movie.  Don't be fooled by the fact that it went right to DVD, because usually when a movie goes  right to DVD, it's not a good sign, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I want to say that again.  I was really happy for you.  We laughed really hard at the movie, especially if you've seen March of the Penguins.  It's a nice parody of that flick. 
[01:53:00]  Well, it's narrated by Samuel L., and then Tracy Morgan's Hilarious, and Louis Black.  Yeah.  You know, and it's got penguin sex, right?  Hey, you got any material on Anna Nicole Smith?  I think, you know, you're taking me back in that area.  Yeah, yeah.  This is the whole interview to get away from.  Yeah.  I think she's probably happy now, because poor thing, you know, she loved her husband  so much, she just wanted to be with him.  Ooh.  She must have loved him. 
[01:53:30]  I mean, you know, it's beautiful.  It's just very sad.  I think it's very, very sad.  I never, I can't really even...  Hey, Bob, we got to take a break, because when we get back...  I mean, if you want to call back to be part of this story, you're more than welcome, but  we got a story about a woman, 84, confesses to sex with boy, 11.  Nice.  And this goes against our theory.  I need her cell number.  Well, you hear about these, like, young teenagers, like, hooking up with older women.  Right. 
[01:54:00]  And we've always been saying on this show, what's the problem?  We all dream of that scenario growing up.  But then when it's an older guy with a younger girl, it's downright creepy.  But we finally found where it is a problem.  Yeah, that's right.  An older woman, younger guy, 84-year-old woman, 11-year-old boy.  Ah.  We got the details next.  Yeah, I think I'll just talk to you next time.  This takes me to a new level.  So, yeah, yeah, I'm going to hang it out.  Hey, 1 versus 100 tonight, at what time?  At 8 o'clock.  8 o'clock.  DVR the damn thing, will you, people? 
[01:54:30]  All right, Bob.  Hey, guys, thank you very, very much.  Thank you, Bob.  Thank you for being there.  Seriously, that was rough, and you guys are just great.  Thank you.  Oh, wow.  Was that a serious moment?  Oh, good, man.  A little milk's coming out of one of my teats.  All right, Bob.  All right, I'll talk to you later.  There he goes.  He's a good friend.  Bob Saget, everyone.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Bob's laughing uncontrollably.  What's going on over there?  We're spitting venom.  Listen, I've been stuck in an airport for like two days. 
[01:55:00]  I haven't slept, and I've been just vile.  And you're coming in here, and you two, your hate towards the universe.  Oh, the pal talk people just got a nice earful.  And everybody is just, you actually made me happy.  You put out the fire of hating me with your hate.  Anthony Venton is just, oh, God.  It's classic when Anthony does it, because unfortunately it's expected from me.  But when he does it, oh, God. 
[01:55:30]  He gets a great reaction from everybody around.  Well, you're an instigator, because you play the audio that you know is just going to get under my skin.  You're going to ruin it.  No, it annoys the, oh, ugh, ugh, ugh, right.  Because I hate, what did you say, you hate what?  Just the phoniness of this crap.  You said everybody.  Everybody, yeah.  I was like, I hate, and then I'm trying to put it into words, and I just said everybody and everything.  I'm just a hateful person. 
[01:56:00]  You hate the planet.  Yeah.  You hate trees.  I do that sometimes when I'm walking around and somebody does something.  I'll just, I will say something like, stupid humans.  God, these earthlings.  Like, I hate earth people.  Like, you're Superman?  No, I just want to separate myself from them.  But deep down, I know I am one of them.  But I just cannot stand the people that reside on this planet.  By the way, we're going to keep this one vague, because they want us all to get along. 
[01:56:30]  We're one big happy family.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  I was only joking.  Ah, ah, yeah.  Because that's how radio works.  Everyone gets along.  I was only joking.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  Anyway, woman 84 confesses to sex with boy 11.  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down slut.  Oh, oh, hey.  We've talked about this over the years.  Like, when these stories come out, it's a, the position we take in general, when you hear 
[01:57:00]  about a really, really, we'll go with the obvious example, a really hot teacher, Bob,  hot, over the top, that blonde.  That blonde.  That blonde from Florida is a, it comes to mind.  Oh, I can't remember her name.  And she gets caught having sex with a, what, what was it, a 15-year-old?  Lefebvre.  Lefebvre.  That Lefebvre broad.  And the kid's 15, we're not talking like he's eight or something.  He's in, he's in that, he's in that age where, man, you dream about having sex with your  teacher.  Think about when you were that age.  When I was in junior high.  It was all about trying to get yourself some. 
[01:57:30]  When I was in junior high, actually, it would be high school.  I, I took French.  I sucked at French.  But the reason I took French was because the teacher was a piece of ass.  Yeah.  And I needed to take a language.  She was ridiculous.  She used to wear the, the low cleavage.  Cleavage.  Cleavage.  Cleavage.  Jesus.  In Cleveland?  Cleveland.  Cleavage everywhere for everybody.  She knew what she was doing.  I used to comb my art teacher's hair in high school.  Right, right.  I used to go in and comb her hair.  That's creepy.  Well, it's not creepy. 
[01:58:00]  No, that's creepy.  She was smoking.  She was smoking.  I'd go in and I'd comb her hair like a hundred strokes.  She had this beautiful black silky hair.  Yeah.  I'd go in and comb it.  And she'd take me out of class to go have lunch with her.  Did you get worked up as you were combing her hair?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did she know that you were, she had to know.  Yeah.  She had to know.  And one day she touched the back of my head and my second stepdad used to hit me there,  so I just threw a chair at her.  And then it was all over.  Hey, by the way, we're getting ready for what did you learn on the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:58:30]  I want to plug that so people could start calling for that cute little bit.  Educational program.  It's a benchmark bit.  That was really joky.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a joke, by the way.  Let's all relax.  Anyway, but we're talking pretty much for every teenager.  Like, you're in that age and you're fantasizing about having sex with maybe an older woman,  your teacher certainly, maybe the older babysitter, I don't know, whatever it is.  And if she's one of the hottest women you've ever seen, all the better. 
[01:59:00]  And it's a double standard because then you hear these stories about older guys with like  a girl that's 12, 13, 14 in that age, then it's now right creepy.  The girl that age is supposed to, her job is to hold on to it.  A guy that age, his job is to get rid of it.  It's certainly a double standard.  Of course, you got it.  When these stories come out, we're like, what is the real problem here?  This is what kids, guys, little teenagers dream about.  What every B movie when I was a kid was about.  Yeah.  So we finally, the bits got in because this is just, this scenario has to stop. 
[01:59:30]  It's tragic.  Because this is where it gets just, and we finally found a story where it's not hot.  It's downright disgusting.  84-year-old woman confesses to sex with boy 11.  Oh, boy.  She's like 11.  11.  And she's 84.  Oh, I thought you said 86.  Okay.  Jesus.  84.  But it's Portland. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Portland, Oregon or me?  Yeah, Oregon.  An 84-year-old woman who confessed to having sex with an 11-year-old boy in her foster care  reached a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty Thursday to attempted sex abuse.  Georgie.  Georgie will serve 36 months in prison.  Georgie.  My name is Georgina.  She's doing...  Call me Georgie.  I actually...  She's doing three years for this.  Three years stint.  I went with a 76-year-old woman four years ago. 
[02:00:30]  Yeah?  Yeah.  She was a...  Wait, you're not kidding?  A lady?  No, seriously.  She was a lady of the night.  She was supposed to be mature.  A lady of the night?  What, a vampire?  Well, you know.  The hell is a lady of the night at that age?  She gives a prostate massage and a back rub she's supposed to give.  Uh-huh.  So I went to it and she was 76 and she had like cotton candy hair and her negligee didn't  fit and she had like lumpy knuckles from the arthritis.  And she looked like that drawing in Playboy magazine of the old bra. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly, dude.  Exactly.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let's slow this down a little bit.  So you were looking for a lady of the evening but you were looking for...  You were looking for a mature...  Yes.  Is that something that gets you off in a woman?  Well, I had one before by accident and she was like...  She was unbelievable.  She took two and a half hours.  She gave me tea and a stone.  Tea and a stone?  She gave me a green stone that was supposed to help my energy.  Oh, I thought you were talking about scones.  No, a stone.  Yeah, I got you.  A stone.  It was once she passed, it was a kidney stone. 
[02:01:30]  Bob, you're in your mid-30s?  Back then, I was...  It had to be when I was...  Yeah, when I was 30.  30?  Yeah, it had to be that old.  And how old was she, the tea lady?  The tea lady was probably around 41, maybe.  All right.  So that's an older woman experience.  But now you hit it out of the ballpark.  She was 76?  I showed up.  She opened the door.  She had like a...  You know that lump on the back of old ladies' necks when their posture just gives way  and their shoulders get rounded and she has that hump?  Oh, my God.  And her hair with her...  She's got a lack of calcium. 
[02:02:00]  Her hair looked like it was made of cotton candy.  Like just a stick and twirl it around in there and have some.  It's so thin, they tease it up to try to cover the areas and it's just this see-through  mess.  Yeah.  It's like a thin cloud of fog.  She had liver spots.  She looked like a jaguar.  Oh, my God.  I looked like a jaguar.  And then...  That's what you want, Bob.  I actually went in.  She told me how old she was at the door to give me the chance of like, look, I'm out.  And I went in.  And she took my hand, kind of. 
[02:02:30]  And she couldn't really hold onto it correctly because she had...  With that knuckly, veiny, arthritic hand.  Does it feel like skin anymore?  No.  Two of her fingers went left and the other two went right.  You don't feel skin.  You feel tendons.  I went upstairs and she had an elevator.  Yeah.  In her house.  Right up from a whiskey-a-go-go.  And then I went upstairs.  There was probably around, seriously, like 35 cats just staring at me.  Crazy cat lady.  Good.  And she took me up. 
[02:03:00]  She gave me a back rub like with...  She couldn't really open her hand out on one of her hands.  So she just rubbed her knuckles on my back.  What an awful experience.  That was actually...  Yeah.  It was...  Well, I don't know.  It was...  Yeah.  I get...  Well...  It just sounds like...  But you did...  You completed an act?  Well, it was supposed to be...  Yes.  Yes.  Well, it was a good massage.  She gave me a great massage.  Yeah.  And a full body.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It was fantastic.  And there was like other things that were supposed to go along with it.  And I was like, does that come with it? 
[02:03:30]  And she was like, do you want that?  And I was like, well, if it's included.  Do you want this?  If it's included on the menu, yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I did.  And she was kind of mad at me for that.  So she just snapped a rubber glove on and...  All right.  All right.  All right.  Just keep it there.  We got it all figured out from there.  She's just like, no one asks for this.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I was like, look, that was just...  Especially when they see me come to the door.  Yeah.  You ghoul.  Yeah.  That's just to get you to my place.  The sad part is that she's probably dead.  Of course.  That's a weird thing.  I'm like, well, you can't even go back to it.  Years ago.  All right.  Well, hey, we could go all day with your fun stories, but we have to say hi to Patrice. 
[02:04:00]  Girl, great neck.  What's going on?  Oh, no.  This is Mike, I guess.  All right.  Mike in Tampa.  What did you learn on the Opie and Anthony show?  I learned today that Opie would rather be spanked by a man than play toddler at theater.  Yeah.  You did learn that today.  Yeah, man.  I can deny that one.  Very educational.  Robert Kelly, what's the website for tour dates?  You know what?  Just go to my MySpace, myspace.com slash Robert Kelly live.  I'm going to be in Michigan next week, Chicago the week after that, and then I'm all over 
[02:04:30]  the improvs down to Florida the week after that.  So just go to my MySpace.  MySpam.  Go to MySpam.  I know, right?  What is going on with MySpace?  I go now, I check, and I put a warning.  You know that sunny thing?  That sunny day thing?  That sunny thing?  Every time that pops up, I write back an awful message to the person about what it, and  it's full of curses about what a spamming piece of crap they are, and then I put, I have  a warning on the front of my page with the picture of that with the red circle and slash  saying, if you send this to me, you're blocked. 
[02:05:00]  I'm never getting another message from you, and you're dead to me.  What about the hot chicks, though?  I go to my MySpace.  I did a show the other night.  I go back.  There's like 25 slamming girls.  I was at the Laugh Factory.  Great show.  I'm thinking all these girls.  I'm like, oh my God, this is great.  Every single one of them was fake.  Yeah.  Hey, I was just checking.  I was like, you say.  They're all spam now.  MySpace is my spam.  It's just my spam.  It really is.  That's all it is now.  But still go to my MySpace and check out my dates.  All right.  What's your MySpace account? 
[02:05:30]  MySpace.com.  Slash, we know.  Robert Kelly Live.  Robert Kelly Live.  Very good.  Let's go to Redding from Wack Bag.  Sorry.  What did you learn, Redding?  Yeah, I learned that after the show, Bob Kelly's going to be asking for a wow magnet.  Yeah.  Well, all right.  Very good.  Matt and I in Idaho.  Idaho, what's up?  Not much.  What do you know?  Hey, man.  What do you know, man?  I learned that in order to get a joke from CBS people, you have to be told when it's funny. 
[02:06:00]  Right.  I have to explain it to you.  Oh, wait a minute.  I was only joking.  Yeah, we were just joking.  Don't take it so soon.  I was only joking.  Joe in Texas.  What's up?  Hey there, Joe.  Joe?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  What's up, Joe?  Speak.  Hey, Opie.  You're my favorite, man.  Anthony.  Love the show.  Thank you, Joe.  Great.  I get the retarded ones that like me.  That's wonderful.  I like you, Opie.  You're good to know.  What's up, Joe?  Just called in to tell you that, man. 
[02:06:30]  All right.  My God.  He waited two hours to say he likes the show.  Thanks, Joe in Texas.  That's great.  We got to get out of here.  Anthony's got a meeting.  Oh, I got to go.  Yeah.  Now I got to go in there with John and discuss.  Have fun.  Hey, Robert.  Thank you.  Thank you, Bobby.  Thank you.  Bob Kelly, everyone.  Pleasure.  Yeah.  Have a great weekend.  We're going to XM.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:07:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  We're going to XM.  Thank you. 
[02:07:30]  Thank you. 
[02:08:00]  Thank you. 
[02:08:30]  Thank you. 
[02:09:00]  Thank you. 
[02:09:30]  Thank you. 
[02:10:00]  Thank you. 
[02:10:30]  Thank you. 
[02:11:00]  Thank you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Thank you. 
[02:11:30]  Thank you. 
[02:12:00]  Thank you. 
[02:12:30]  On what planet does it make sense to have a meeting in the middle of a radio show? 
[02:13:00]  Because in our world, it's in the middle of a radio show.  Yeah, it was in between shows.  Yeah, it was in the middle of a radio show.  So we had to play a little longer clip, so I hope you understand.  So deal with it.  I'm sure someone out there, but I'm sure someone out there, but I'm sure someone out there doesn't understand.  Yeah, I pretty much talked as fast as I could, and then informed John that, excuse me, I have a filthy show to do. 
[02:13:30]  Right.  Right.  Which, of course, I'm sure you're going to do it, but I'm sure you're going to do it, but I'm sure you're going to do it.  Right.  I'm sure you're going to be typing.  Oh, I'm sure you're going to be typing.  Are your fingers going to be rattling away at your typewriter?  I guarantee one that I send will start off, on what planet does it make sense?  And it'll be a rhetorical question, because you won't even need an answer as to what planet. 
[02:14:00]  And I'll even write that.  I don't need an answer.  I don't need an answer.  I already have an answer.  I already understand what's going on.  But you need to know that I'm on to your stupid game.  Any sound?  Do you understand?  I just got in.  Oh, my God.  Whack bag entry.  You could absolutely be bounced.  All right.  This guy was on hold for two hours over at the other joint.  Nasir.  Nasir. 
[02:14:30]  Nasir.  Nasir.  How do you say your name there?  Yeah.  How do you say your name, bro?  Nasir.  Nasir.  Yeah, it's a Muslim name.  I ain't Muslim.  I'm back.  You're on hold for two hours over at the other joint.  What's going on?  Two hours?  Yeah.  No, I just want to say I crossed over, man.  I like you.  I love your show.  I was working with some cat, right, that was training me.  And he was force-feeding me, the XM, because we had to drive around and whatnot. 
[02:15:00]  That bastard.  Oh, I'm liking it.  Yeah?  So, let me finish this story.  So, you stole it from him.  No?  That's why I love this show.  Hey, keep going now, man.  Don't stop.  Of course.  I couldn't.  It's in my blood.  It's in my DNA.  I'm Italian.  You took an oath.  I took an oath to my family.  Yeah, into the clan.  Like the mafia oath.  That's why I can't listen to Hot 97 no more when I got this.  This is kind of like, what? 
[02:15:30]  He's got some wives, especially that other one, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Sick.  Yeah.  Let it be known.  Let it be known we love the Shwuggie.  When it comes right down to it, we love the Shwuggie.  I know.  All right.  I know what all this is, so I know it's a black thing.  Can I tell you?  I play a game on the road now because you introduced me to the word Shwuggie.  Yeah.  Where you take an old song and you add Shwuggie to it.  Like anything, you just take it.  You're like, get down, Shwuggie, Shwuggie, Shwuggie.  Nice.  Hey, can we play that game on our show? 
[02:16:00]  Dude, it is the funnest game.  Man, I played it with you.  He's writing.  Let's see.  You took the oath, too, did you?  Yeah, dude.  It's the funnest game.  You're going to take old disco songs.  What are those things called?  Brazil nuts?  They will never be called Brazil nuts.  You take the oath.  Oh, P.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sorry about that.  Yo, you say, doctor, too, what you did to my man, Bob Saget.  Yeah.  That was just, that was, that was, that had me, but I'm smoking a blunt.  I'm like saying to myself, yeah, these cats, these cats is really rodless. 
[02:16:30]  We were one step away from saying, my dead, my dead dad could kick your dead dad's ass.  Yeah.  Wasn't that really sick?  You know what?  That was a sick moment today.  My dad died like a man.  My dead dad could kick your dead dad's ass.  What do you think of them apples?  Yeah, it was a little twisted.  In the middle of that, I'm like, what the fuck are we doing?  He actually called your dad a name, like a dead, what did he call it, a baby bird?  What did he call it?  The dead bird?  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, Anthony.  Yes, sir. 
[02:17:00]  Hey, listen, let me tell you, let me tell you how I got down with y'all, right?  Check this out.  So, I get the XM and the dude is training.  I like the nightlife.  I like the shwuggie on a shwuggie ride.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, I want to see you do it, though.  Do we have one of these songs?  Come on, Bill.  Come on, Bill.  Oh, boy.  What?  We want to play the shwuggie gang.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy. 
[02:17:30]  Oh, that one works well.  Yeah.  Shwuggie, dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  Ah, honey, honey.  No, you're going to say, shwuggie, shwuggie.  All right, listen.  You are my shwuggie girl.  Can I make a suggestion as E-Rock has his horns over his face because he's feeling what everyone else is feeling here?  There's nothing wrong within the organization to take someone off the bench and put them in that seat for a couple minutes and let Bill light.  Oh, no.  Bill feels like he's being fired right now. 
[02:18:00]  You're panicking, right, a little bit?  He's a little red.  Actually, no.  It's just my old music.  I usually don't know a lot of things.  All right, so there's nothing wrong with you raising your hand and going, coach, take me out of the game for a little while.  Coach.  Understood.  Or homosexual.  Bill.  Whatever.  Bill, put the headphones back on.  We're not firing you.  We know you're getting up to speed, but there's nothing wrong with stepping out of your seat and letting someone else take over that might know this music a little more.  That's all.  That's all I'm saying. 
[02:18:30]  Did Kenny go for smoothies, more importantly?  No.  I did say old disco.  Steve should have jumped right in.  Yeah.  I've got it.  What do you need?  We want to play the shwoogie game.  I love it.  Which song do we start with?  Boogie, oogie, oogie.  All right.  Bob, whenever you're ready.  Make believe you're in your car.  The radio's on.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:19:00]  Love the disco look.  Love that polyester.  Gotta love the shwo.  Could you get one with a longer intro?  Yeah, no kidding.  Jesus Christ.  This had that great bass line that we could play.  If you could stare away to heaven, we'll do it with that.  Even if you couldn't play bass guitar, you could play this bass line.  All right, here we go.  Yeah.  All right.  You see a bunch of shwoogies on roller skates going backwards.  And in the middle of the disco, don't they go, shwoogie. 
[02:19:30]  Exactly, dude.  Shwoogie.  You just throw shwoogie everywhere.  Let's play the shwoogie game.  This is a long intro.  It's the longest fucking.  Jeez.  Shwoogie, shwoogie, shwoogie, shwoogie.  Shwoogie, shwoogie, shwoogie.  Shwoogie, shwoogie.  Going back to 1978.  It's your high school class reunion all weekend long.  Shwoogie, shwoogie. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, boy, have I got news for you.  Yeah, here we go.  Let Bob do it.  Come on, Bob.  Come on.  Everybody here tonight was shwoogie.  There it is.  Let me tell you, I'm no exception to the rules.  Get on up on the floor.  Cause you're gonna shwoogie, oogie, oogie, oogie.  You just can't shwoogie no more. 
[02:20:30]  There it comes, the best part.  Shwoogie, shwoogie no more.  You can't shwoogie no more.  Shwoogie, shwoogie no more.  You can't tell the shwoogie.  Damn.  Yeah.  Everyone's gonna be thinking about this show all weekend now.  Turn on your radio station and have fun with the shwoogie game.  We'll see. 
[02:21:00]  I love it.  Shwoogie.  Oh, yeah.  Got another one?  Yeah.  All right, we got another one?  All right, it's the shwoogie game.  This is a Robert Kelly invention here.  Original.  Go ahead there.  Here's Bill.  Let's see where this could come in.  That's a good one.  That's a great song.  See, it comes with any old song.  All right, here we go.  Bob Kelly.  Shwoogie.  Ah, shwoogie, shwoogie. 
[02:21:30]  You are my shwoogie girl.  Here we go.  One more time.  Shwoogie.  Ah, shwoogie, shwoogie.  It's fun.  You are my shwoogie girl.  And you got me watching you.  All right, good luck with that one.  Anthony from Queens.  He writes, hey, man, play the four tops.  I can't help myself.  Shwoogie pie.  Honey pie. 
[02:22:00]  And one listener is tapping out.  He doesn't want to play this stupid game.  It's fun.  Oh, it's going to make me laugh all weekend.  I'm going to find those crappy stations all weekend now.  But the best part is you get people to play who don't know what the word shwoogie means.  So they, you know, they're humming it on the train.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie. 
[02:22:30]  All right, we got to find another good one.  Got another?  You got another one?  What do you got?  What do you got?  Here we go.  Oh, yeah.  You know what I'm doing?  You can do with anything, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got to get to the chorus, though.  You can also add Shwoogie into the beat. 
[02:23:00]  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  I want to put on my, my, my, my, my, my Shwoogie shoes.  And Shwoogie with you.  I want to put on my, my, my, my, my, my Shwoogie shoes.  And Shwoogie with you.  I want to put on my, my, my, my, my, my Shwoogie shoes. 
[02:23:30]  I want to put on my, my, my, my, my Shwoogie shoes.  Oh, that's good on that one.  There's always someone that has to ruin it.  Right now, it's very, very fun.  But, of course, someone from their cell phone is suggesting, I shot the Shwoogie by Clapton.  Oh, that doesn't even really fit. 
[02:24:00]  But it does fit.  But it does fit.  You can put Shwoogie anywhere.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my shoe shoes.  Is it?  I shot the Shwoogie.  Well, we didn't really want to do it.  Yeah, we didn't want to do it.  Jesus.  Wow.  It was just funny to read the answer feedback when you got it.  Apparently any song, any song.  This can work with.  Yeah.  See, you guys said the word Shwoogie one time, and I was in my car doing like 48 colleges  in a row in Pennsylvania, and I was driving like eight hours a day. 
[02:24:30]  I took the fan on a couple of those shows with me, so I love the word Shwoogie.  We always listen to the show.  Yeah.  And then it just fit everywhere.  It fits everywhere.  Just throw a random song on it.  Just a random song.  See if it works.  Something, you know, a popular 80s or something song.  He's having a problem with that.  It's random.  It means anyone you see.  The catalog isn't big enough.  Here's one from Marty in Michigan.  Marty.  Hey, y'all.  Hey, love you guys. 
[02:25:00]  Thanks, Marty.  When you're hanging your negro from a tall tree, you can play, hang on, Shwoogie, Shwoogie,  hang on.  See, it does fit, though.  It does fit.  Even though you should be shot for being that racist.  Yeah.  We didn't need the explanation.  You don't have to make this bit more racist.  Yeah, really.  He's taking a cute word and making it fun.  Yeah.  He's just hanging.  See, everybody's thinking like disco and it's got to be boogie or something.  It doesn't.  All right.  Tony, New Hampshire. 
[02:25:30]  Tony.  Jungle, Shwoogie.  See?  Yeah, I mean.  But that, again, is another boogie one.  I want to see if it'll just work like in a Beatles song.  Sure.  Got to work on something.  All right.  You got one?  Go ahead.  Just hit it.  Let's see.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Don't you forget about Shwoogie. 
[02:26:00]  Boston Strangler's suggesting, I saw the Shwoogie.  I saw the sign.  Inside and out, Shwoogie.  Shwoogie things.  Kevin from Jersey suggesting the Beatles, I am the Shwoogie. 
[02:26:30]  Can we do I am the Walmers, please, by the Beatles?  Cuckoo, cachoo.  That's funny, dude.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sometimes the song goes along with it. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah.  I'm crying, sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come, corporation t-shirts, stupid 
[02:27:30]  bloody Tuesday man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow like, I am the Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  I am the Shwoogie.  I am the Shwoogie.  Woo!  I am the Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Pretty little policeman.  Oh, my bet.  This bit is so awful, it's great.  It's so good.  It's so good.  It's so good.  It's so good.  I'm guessing the knack, my Sharona. 
[02:28:00]  My Shwoogie.  My Shwoogie.  My Shwoogie.  Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop.  All right.  Jeremy in Connecticut.  Jeremy.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jeremy.  Hey, how about the electric slide?  It's electric.  Shwoogie, woogie, woogie.  That's a good one.  Shwoogie, woogie, woogie.  That's a good one.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Casey and the Sunshine Band.  How's that?  What's that?  Shake, shake, shake.  Shake, shake, shake. 
[02:28:30]  Shake your shwoogie.  I've done that one.  That's a great one.  That's a fun one.  I've done that one.  All right, let's try the fun one then.  Can you find that song there?  Shake, shake, shake.  Shake your shwoogie.  Shake your shwoogie.  Oh, shake, shake.  Shake.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  Shwoogie.  We blew up the phones by the way.  Ow.  Either that or everyone said, fuck these guys today.  Ah, believe me.  Our listeners, they blew them up.  They blew them up.  They know.  It's either no one's calling or too many people are calling.  All right, here we go, Bob.  It's a great song. 
[02:29:00]  The Shwoogie Game with Bob Kelly, everybody.  Casey.  Robert Kelly live on MySpace.  Yeah.  Nice.  Casey.  Don't fight.  Don't fight.  Is that porn section going?  Yeah.  Give yourself a change.  Yeah.  A little hi-hat in the back.  Shake, shake, shake.  No, shoot.

Shake your shwoogie.  Oh, UK.  That's so stupid.  I love now.  I could've played this all weekend.  I know.  Now every song that comes on you're gonna try to fit shwoogie into.  I like it.  Good game, Bobby. 
[02:30:00]  Thanks.  That's something to play on when you're driving on a long trip.  Instead of car bingo.  Teach the kids the shwoogie game.  I know we want to move on, but you've got to do like a Bee Gees or something.  You've got a Bee Gees?  All right, here we go.  A little Bee Gees.  A little Bee Gees.  Go on to the shwoogie, yeah?  A bunch of faggots with these voices.  What the fuck?

That's not tough.  That's easy.  Phil Collins.  Oh, he turns Sicilian.  Shwoogie-o.  Yeah, right?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm glad I passed the board.

Game better.  That's a good one, dude.  I've done that.  Oh, boy.  What's the live version doing on the radio?  Oh.  Live versions stink.  Unless you're Peter Frampton.  Yeah, because you never really get the feel of a song with a live version.  We don't have the studio version? 
[02:32:30]  Oh, boy.  Thanks.  Bit, bit, bit, runer.  Does he have a fucking, does he have a pedal brake over there for the show?  Oh, man.  Just jams down on it.  This bit is all about timing.  When the show with him is like taking driver's ed.  When you make the wrong, he has pedals on his side.  Get down.  Get down.  Get down.  You see two brake lights on the back of his chair.  Light up.  Get down.  Get down.  I was just throwing songs out of him.  Get down.  What did we ask for 20 minutes ago?  Get down.  Get down.  We know Jungle Swoogie.

People are making them real hard now.  The Edmund Fitz Swoogie.  How do you do the Edmund Fitz Swoogie?  The Swoogie went there.  The wreck of the Edmund Fitz Swoogie.  That's it.  You did it.  The Swoogie went down to Georgia.  The Swoogie went down to Georgia.  Looking for a fridge to steal.  Looking for anything to steal.

[02:43:30]  That you're like  You know what  That was  You know what  You just fucked me  I became a faggot  And I love you  I love this guy  Every guy he fucks  That'd be a great show  And then this one  Is just brilliant  It's just  It shows the brilliance of him  You can't touch me  You're not man enough  I'll eat your asshole alive  You bitch  I'll eat your asshole alive  Not just  I'll eat your asshole  You won't kill her  I will kill you  Before I eat your asshole  I'm gonna eat it  While you're alive  It has to be alive  And then obviously  He's gonna kill you  After that

[02:45:00]  Just random words  Yeah  He just random  Fuck you  I'll fuck your asshole  Like a faggot  And then you'll like it  And then your mother  Will suck it  Fucking cunt  Alright  Moving on to the next thing here  So  Back to sexy  Steve brought this  To our attention  We're like  God  I think we gotta fire Steve  He's losing his mind  But now I'm on board  And a lot of other people  Are on board  I like that  Steve believes  With all his heart  That Sam here  To your left  That his head  Is filled with  Delicious candy  And he's always 
[02:45:30]  Trying to get it  Out of his head  By finding the  Proper combination  Of pushing his nose  And turning his ear  And Steve walks around  Trying to get candy  Out of his head  And I'm like  Wow  This guy needs help  But now I'm really  Into this  What the fuck  Look at his  Look at his head  It's so obvious  Dundee looks so sweet  That there's gotta be  Candy in his head  So they follow him around  And smack him  On the back of the head  And hold their hand  In front of his mouth  Show Bob  Some of the things  Try to get candy  Out of his head  Try to get candy  Out of Sam's head  The first one is this  Is you put your hand  In front of his mouth  And you tap 
[02:46:00]  Gentleman  In the back of his head  Hoping it would spit out  Like a Pez  Or something  And there's nothing  The obvious way  The Pez  But then there's secret things  Like you push his nose  There's no secrets  Or you gotta like  Slide an eyebrow  And turn his ear  No there's no combination  What other combination  There's candy in your head  There's theories  That there's a secret knock  Of sorts  That you have to go  Around the head  I would actually  I'm kind of with this now  Do you see those  Two red rosy things  Yeah the rosy things  You push both of them  At the same time  Oh see 
[02:46:30]  I think that might be  Push both of them  Watch out  It's gonna spill  All over the place  You have to do it  At the front  Do it with one hand  With your thumb and finger  And then hold on the bottom  Because the candy's  Gonna come spilling out  Yeah you're right  So we gotta get the candy  Out soon  Because  There's no candy  Because he's  Candy in your head  Shut up  He's a candy factory  And he's manufacturing  Candy as we speak  Walk to me  All right  Bob's even trying now  Oh  Nothing  No nothing  See  Bob put his hands out too  Because I was sure  Candy was coming out  That time  The other thing is  It sounds extremely stingy 
[02:47:00]  With the candy  That he stores up there  Yeah so we might have  To take it one day  A la a piÃ±ata  Like a piÃ±ata  And just bash his head in  Yeah there you go  Bobby  Bobby's got a  Club  It won't work  Crack it open  Like a piggy bank  Like a  Like project people  With a piggy bank  What'll come out  If we smash your head open  Just blood and bones  And I'll be dead  And that's it  All right  He could be better  We tried pulling out his tongue  No  I think  I believe  Than did the other day  Oh yeah okay  But we could  No  Again we could  Like I said 
[02:47:30]  We could saw it  Right above the brow  Can we contact  Willy Wonka  Yeah because there's  Gotta be something  That a professional  Might know  Wait a minute  Now he wants to use  A bone saw  Around his head  Maybe the head  Is actually candy itself  No  Did you think of that  Maybe if you heat it up  In an oven  No  And try licking it  Don't lick my head  Bob see the rosy cheeks  Still the candy  Just  It's begging to come out  That's what the cheeks are  It's begging to come out  It's so rosy  And that's why  He doesn't have facial hair  Because there's candy inside 
[02:48:00]  It's a fake head  You don't shave  The candy in your head  No there's not  I got another  Bustle for you  How to get me out of your fucking  Bustle  You are wise  To me  No  He  He's  Not all  You said  I really  Out of your mind  See  But  Just look at him  I'm actually  I'm hungry  You want candy  Yeah like I'm having salt right now  But it makes me want sweet  I'm picturing  Jolly ranchers  What's up with the lips  Are those like those wax lips 
[02:48:30]  You can  Can you do me a favor  Can I just bite your cheek right here  No  It's Bob  Let me just bite your cheek  Right here  You're selfish  You're being selfish  Don't be selfish  Oh my god  There's no camera  Don't worry Sam  No one will believe this happened  Oh my god  He's biting  He's biting  Oh wow  Oh my goodness  Bobby just bit his cheek  What does he taste like  He tastes like candy  He's so sweet  He's like very sweet  You know the stick  Remember the little candies 
[02:49:00]  With the sugar  You dip the stick in  But the stick was made of  Right  That's what his little cheek  Tastes  Like vanilla  Like the stick  The stick was a vanilla like thing  Dude he really does taste sweet  This is your theme song  I hate you Steve  I just hate you  I love these guys  They walk around just studying Sam  Trying to figure out how it's going to happen one day  It's not  One day it's just going to come pouring out 
[02:49:30]  No it isn't  I know a guy who's tough but sweet  Aww  Stop it Sam  But he can be beat  That's true  He's got everything that I desire  Yeah  And what's that?  Since the summer sun on fire  Alright you can turn it off  I want to be 
[02:50:00]  Man everyone  I want swiggy  Oh swiggy bitch  Look at him  No candy  Look how red his cheeks are  He's getting shaky  Because I think this song  Might have something to do with  He could unleash the candy  No  No  No  And now finally  That's a good theme song  The third part of this discussion 
[02:50:30]  What did you bring to the table?

Yeah, there's really no, uh, no question there.  When you're saying what, what in my butt and you want to do it in my butt, uh, that's, 
[03:05:30]  that's pretty much, not much left to the imagination there.  No, it is horrible.  Um, this has been a really gay week.  Uh, we need something.  It's gay week here on the Anthony Show.  We need, we need a hardcore female to do something crazy today.  Uh, can we get one?  What time is it?  I don't care.  We got phones.  They're at home.  Do something.  Yeah, any girls, um, got, uh, vibrator.  A hairbrush, anything. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, hairbrush, anything.  We need a girl to really, really cleanse the palate here.  Just go off on yourself with a vibrator.  Yeah, we.  Oh, can I say something?  Did you guys ever hear about the new, uh, toothbrush vibrator?  No.  What is this?  What are you handing out?  It's Harry Potter.  That's Harry Potter from Equus.  And, um, what it is is a picture of him from behind. 
[03:06:30]  Uh, he's on, uh, he's standing there and, um, there seems to be a lot of smoke up to his  knees and all the rest.  He's completely nude from the back and his butt cheeks are all clenched.  Why is he clenching his ass cheeks?  Because he wants to, uh, show that sexy ass temple.  Watch what?  Watch what?  Watch what?  You can make him dance.  You can't see his, uh, I think his, his, his, his shterminke.  His, uh, ball, his ball bag.  You can't see the shterminke.  Yeah, you can't see it.  I think it's taped to the side.  Leave it to Bobby to notice that you can't see Harry Potter's nutsack hanging through, 
[03:07:00]  uh, hanging down from his butt cheeks.  You should be able to see the balls and the tip of the cock.  He's a young kid.  It don't hang down like Turkish taffy in July.  The fuck are you thinking?  All right, let's go to, uh, click-clack balls.  Let's go to Jim in South Dakota.  Jim.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Jim.  Hey, uh, the only time that song should be played is when the guy's at the proctologist  finding out he has colon cancer.  He's asking the doctor what, what in the butt, and the doctor says, I'm sorry it's cancer. 
[03:07:30]  Kemp said, Kemp said, Harry could have a heart on.  That's why he can't see it from behind.  That's true.  There you go.  All right.  Dare to dream.  I'm clearing out all the people that want to call us gay, because I'm,  I'm, I'm fishing for a female that's going to get, get the gay out of this show.  Yeah, come on.  Get it, girl.  We got to end the week with something very, very sexy.  Do we have a prize closet?  Do we have something in the prize closet that a girl can get if she calls up and takes the 
[03:08:00]  gay out of this show immediately?  She has to do this.  Get a brawn toothbrush, an electric toothbrush.  Yeah.  And put it on your clitoris.  I'm not even kidding you.  This is the best fucking, it's taking over Europe.  It's going to take over here.  Toothbrush.  There's some, they have a new attachment.  They actually take the toothbrush head off and put this little finger on it now they sell.  But you take the toothbrush, put the little flat side on, put it on your clitoris and 
[03:08:30]  turn it on.  And I guarantee you, you'll come twice in a minute.  And this is huge in Europe?  And this girl's shoot.  No.  Well, it's just, they figured out that this brawn toothbrush, the way it vibrates, is like  the best fucking vibrator ever.  Maybe someday the Europeans will get that toothbrush up to their mouths.  And they put the base of it on their clit or the brush end.  You take the, no, you don't brush your pussy.  I don't know. 
[03:09:00]  The fuck, you get toothpaste and squirt it on your clit and brush your stinky snatch.  And floss your clit.  Yeah, so it doesn't smell like feet.  Dude, we really got to do something crazy because I'm getting fucking text messages from  my family too.  I know, my family's saying, what the fuck are you doing?  My brother, Brett, who's the owner of FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue in Huntington  Village.  You guys, please don't be gay.  I like you as my brother.  Yeah.  Look at, this is what I say.  As long as our boyfriends aren't calling us, texting us, we're fine. 
[03:09:30]  But when you consider, that text came from a guy that sucked his own dick in a bathtub.  Wait, what?  He's a responsible business owner.  Of course he is.  I understand him.  He was a child at the time.  What a flexible back that boy had.  Big dick.  It is one of the best fucking Hughes family stories ever told.  We should do Hughes Week on the Open and Open Show.  It's one of the best Hughes family stories ever. 
[03:10:00]  Yeah, but yeah, my brother, Brett, tells one of the best stories ever.  Well, in the bathtub, you're learning about yourself as a child.  He was a child, Bob.  And perhaps you're playing with yourself a little bit.  You're jacking maybe or something like that.  But he discovered he was able to reach.  He was able to reach and actually get his mouth.  Like he didn't try for the hell of it.  Yeah, I tried.  I'm a pat out.  My fucking neck fat rolled up on my trachea.  He was fucking laying on the pillow with Saddam's neck after he was hung. 
[03:10:30]  He was just fucking twisted.  Anthony does bring up a good point.  Yes.  Well.  Yeah.  So he was.  He was young.  He was in the.  Young.  You know.  I love how you.  The formative years.  Yeah.  When you shouldn't.  You should be playing baseball and hanging at a park.  Not sucking your own cock.  Oh, you knew it was a tub.  You should be sucking your own cock at our age.  If it ended there.  It would be fine.  But it didn't end there.  See.  Wait a minute.  In order to do this in the bathtub. 
[03:11:00]  Yes.  You realize you're underwater kind of.  Wait a minute.  He was taking a.  He's taking a bath.  A bath.  You're a kid.  You're in the bathtub.  Yeah.  So he's in the bathtub.  It was alone time.  I'm one of seven.  Alone time.  You've got alone time when you went to the bathtub.  Where are you going to suck your dick when you've got seven other people in the house?  In the bathtub.  So there's water.  Yeah.  So there's water in the tub.  So when he went down to do that to himself, the water went up and kind of covered his ears.  And here's the problem.  I've got to jump in really fast.  My mom was convinced we were dying 24 hours a day, always checking up on us. 
[03:11:30]  So he can't hear.  Because he's sucking his own dick.  And the water is above his ears.  So now their mom.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  So he's underneath his ears.  So all he can hear is that mumble.  Yeah.  It's like an episode of Sea Hunt.  He's got his respirator in his mouth.  And he's fighting off criminals.  He's fighting off jellyfish.  Jellyfish and moray eels.  But he really can't see because the water's all soapy. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Tastes like Mr. Bubble and Capricum.  The tub is like egg drop soup.  So their mom is like knocking on the door saying, Brett, are you all right?  Now, Brett can't hear because, first of all, the water's over his ears.  Secondly, he's amazed by the fact that you're sucking your own dick.  So lo and behold.  Wait.  How long do you decide to hold your breath in that situation?  That's a tricky situation. 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  How long does it take to come?  How long do you decide to hold your breath?  My God.  So then mom walks in.  Oh, God, no.  Swear.  I got caught jerking off.  That is a real.  Getting caught sucking your own cock.  Do you look on and go, wow, for a split second, out of sheer horror, do you go, wow, I can't  believe he can do that.  And then, oh, my God, he's sucking his own dick.  So my mom.  Yeah, this is great.  Listen to what mom does.  According to Brett when he tells this story, it's one of our favorites ever. 
[03:13:00]  She comes in.  He's under the water doing what he's doing.  Because I can't sing.  It's my brother.  Can I ask you a question?  I don't really want to stop you.  Wait a minute.  Now, there's a difference between putting your dick in your mouth and sucking it.  Do you understand me, right?  What are you asking?  Was he good at it?  Well, look it.  If I put my finger in my mouth, that's no big deal.  But if I start sucking it and licking it and spitting on it, was he sucking his own  dick or was he just putting his dick in his mouth? 
[03:13:30]  I don't know.  I'm asking that.  I would assume, though, if I had enough information, I didn't need more.  If as I was growing up, I found out I could do that, I would suck my cock like a champ.  I'd suck it and spit on it.  Like a champ.  I'd pull my own hair.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, pull my own hair.  And then I'd kick my ass out when I'm done.  Get the fuck out.  Anyway, so she barges in and he's doing what he's doing.  She screams.  She screams.  Brett hears a scream. 
[03:14:00]  That makes him pop out of the water.  Because now he can finally hear it.  Because even if you're underwater, you'll hear a scream.  Underwater, when you're sucking your dick, you can't hear screams.  Do you know how careful you are when you're about to suck your own dick?  And the fact that you got caught up sucking your own dick, that you didn't hear the door  open.  I know.  And then you would go from that to like pure pleasure and fantasy to...  And you know it was just this, like you're sucking your dick and all you hear is this  like... 
[03:14:30]  Because yeah, it's like, what?  And then you think, what?  And you know that will make you jump and almost break your own neck.  Wait a minute, do that.  I gotta...  And you're thinking, what the fuck?  Is that a whale?  Is there a whale in the tub here?  I'm just trying to fucking suck my dick.  And then, so she runs out of the bathroom, she runs out of the bathroom, and she screams  now for their father. 
[03:15:00]  No.  Screams.  She's running down the hall, and we're all in the house.  Well, I guess I wasn't.  She starts yelling...  I don't remember the story, but this is fantastic.  But a lot of my siblings were in the house.  She starts yelling around the house, oh my god, she's going...  Well, I'm very good at imitating my mom.  Oh, okay, go ahead.  Freddie, Brett's gay!  First thing she starts yelling, Freddie, Brett's gay.  Because he was...  But you're just a kid experimenting.  She wasn't a fan of the faggot.  And Brett actually had an answer. 
[03:15:30]  What?  He had an answer to this.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Which is...  It is logic in its purest, most innocent form.  And the answer came while he was running down the hallway after her, completely naked,  wet, and probably with a hard eye.  This is your...  Yeah.  This is your brother who's just blown himself.  Okay.  Okay, go ahead.  Runs down the hall after my mom.  Here's his response.  Brett, Freddie, Brett's gay!  Right.  And I don't want to wreck the exact quote.  I'm not gay. 
[03:16:00]  I...  Wait.  I didn't want to...  I wasn't giving it.  I was getting it.  Wow.  Wait, something like that.  Wait, what's the quote?  Because it's classic.  Yeah.  I'm not gay because I didn't want...  I didn't want to give one.  I got...  Yeah, I didn't want to give one.  That's the punchline, too.  I wanted to get one.  Remember it.  Like, the whole gist of it was, even though I'm sucking my own dick, I wasn't...  I'm not gay because I'm...  I'm not...  I was getting it.  I was getting it.  Which negates the giving it. 
[03:16:30]  Right.  But you're actually...  You're actually killing...  Even though it's coming from the same person.  You're killing two birds with one stone, actually.  Right.  Yeah, that's great.  You're getting it and giving it.  So he's running down the hall with a hard-on...  And cum coming out of his mouth.  Like, he's got egg salad coming out of his mouth.  And he's screaming at you.  And your mom's screaming that he's gay.  That's gotta be the fucking top...  I got caught jerking off by my mom's story.  No one has gotten caught in a better situation. 
[03:17:00]  To this day, I wonder why my mom's nuts.  The fact that he was underwater.  All the answers are right there why she's nuts.  That is the best being caught jacking it.  Because it's...  You're not jacking it.  It's just the best you were caught trying to fucking pleasure yourself story.  Oh my god, dude.  Your mom catches you sucking your own dick.  And you can't hear her scream.  And it sounds...  Yeah.  It just...  You hear...  What is that out there?  Oh my god, that's funny. 
[03:17:30]  That's gotta be the best one.  Did he ever say if he did it again?  Someone said the line was, I wanted to see what it felt like.  To receive, not to give.  Oh, I wanted to see what it felt like to get one, not to give one.  We got the line.  Oh, let's hear it.  Alright, here's the line from my brother Brett.  I just wanted one.  I didn't want to give one.  I just wanted one.  I didn't want to give it.  That's how he was saying it, with that panicked voice.  Oh, that's so funny.  I just wanted to get one.  And I didn't want to give it.  And that's the voice.  I forced me.  Of the owner of H. Riley's.  I was raped by myself.  And that's the guy who accused us of being too gay. 
[03:18:00]  Right.  Yeah.  TouchÃ©, my friend.  TouchÃ©.  TouchÃ©.  Did he ever say if he tried it again, or was successful, or if he still has that talent?  Why don't you ask him next time you're there?  God.  I might.  No.  I'll be honest.  I'm curious.  That is hilarious.  I didn't want to give one.  I just wanted to get it.  Just wanted to get it.  And you know that's actually what he said.  Logically, that makes sense, right?  Well, you know, he went, look, dude, I really want to do this, and I think I can.  I think I can. 
[03:18:30]  And he was going, I think I can.  I think I can.  Yeah.  I just want one.  I don't want to give it.  So he probably pushed on the back of his own head to force himself.  Do you know, he's probably doing like certain calisthenics.  He was watching Jack LaLanne for like a month, doing chair exercises.  You got to realize before your pants are even off or anything, you got to go like, you know,  I could get pretty close.  Right.  I think under the right circumstances, I could reach.  Yeah.  You keep getting your shoes, but you lie down on the floor to get them, to put them on,  and you stretch over you.  No matter what you do. 
[03:19:00]  Yeah.  You got every, he's like in training to do like the K-1.  You get change out of your pocket.  You're taking your wallet out of your back pocket.  You bend over with your face in your cross.  No, I'm getting my wallet.  Just get my own wallet.  Well, why are you getting it?  I'm not doing anything.  Why are you burying your face in your crotch?  I have itchy ankles all the time.  By the way, congratulations to my brother, Brett.  Yeah, congratulations.  One of the few, the proud.  The I can suck my own dits.  Congratulations for something else.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh.  Oh.  How did that go? 
[03:19:30]  It went very well for him.  I'll, uh, and I'll be at FH Riley's this weekend, definitely.  Yes.  Buying drinks like I do when I see you, uh, idiots at the bar.  You idiots.  Why do you go to the, you go to the bar over there?  It's my, I own the place with my, uh, brother.  I'm like an asylum partner, though.  That's great.  I don't know.  I don't know how to run a restaurant.  Right.  So.  Yeah.  There you go there.  It's cool.  Great to have a restaurant.  All right.  We still don't have a girl calling.  No.  Come on, ladies.  We need a girl to get really, really.  Get the gay out of the show.  That story didn't do it. 
[03:20:00]  I know, really.  The first time I was ever here, you stuck a wiffle ball bat in a.  Yeah.  Remember the good old bass?  Yeah.  There's the bat, right?  It's up there.  It's all signed.  If a girl impresses us, we'll give them a boombox and a roadie.  All right.  So you're going to get an XM boombox and a roadie.  Come on.  That's a great fucking prize.  Let's call up and do something.  We need a girl before we get out of here for the weekend to do something beyond crazy.  Lens a pallet.  Maybe with the electric toothbrush there, Bob. 
[03:20:30]  Oh, the electric.  If you get, just get your electric toothbrush.  Oh, that's a mean elephant.  Oh, my God.  Well, there's a video of the day on CNN, an elephant just beating the shit out of a vehicle.  Well, maybe because there's no rocks and sticks at it.  I hope that elephant fucking.  That could be the problem.  Look at this smiling fucking newswoman when they come back.  Housing slump.  Elephants just roll over on those savages.  Looks like your face is slumping.  What is that noise?  What is that?  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to Rick in Minnesota.  Rick.  Rick.  What's up, man? 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, I got almost the same exact.  Mine's a little bit more.  I'm serious.  Yeah.  I was able to do the same thing, except for I couldn't sit down and do it.  I had to, like, lay on your back, and then you toss your legs over your head, you know?  So you're wrenching back in your neck a little bit.  So my ass is straight up in the air.  I'm going to town.  And my mom knocks on the door and does the old two-knock open door thing.  Uh-oh.  And, yeah, there I am, good old chocolate starfish right up in the air. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, shit.  I'm just going to town, and she's, like, just looks at me, and she goes, that's not right.  That's not right.  That's not what she envisioned when she brought you home for the first time from the hospital.  No.  In your little coming-home clothes.  Yeah.  Your little snappy little flannel thing when she took you home, and there you are years  later like an animal licking your own fucking pecker.  She said, she goes, that's not right, and you went, but it ain't wrong, and you winked  at her. 
[03:22:00]  Yeah.  Well, you want to do something about it, Ma?  Oh, boy.  Let's go to Jim in Florida.  Jim.  Uh, fellas, what's up?  Hey.  If, uh, if no girl calls in...  We need a girl to call in.  Yeah, we do.  We really need someone to step up for the team today, because this show has been just  ridiculously gay all week long.  Come on.  We leave them with something crazy that a female's doing.  Everyone's going to forget the gay shit.  Don't forget the gay.  Right.  I've got something that will take its place in case a girl doesn't call.  Play the Drill Doe audio.  It is the hottest thing ever. 
[03:22:30]  Oh.  Have you heard the Drill Doe bit?  No.  Well, you know something.  Come on, Bob.  You've never heard that?  I think I have.  The guy with the...  Didn't he chase him outside with a Drill Doe?  No, this guy had a Drill Doe.  It's actually a drill with a fucking Dill Doe on it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or was it a reciprocating saw?  But he ran outside.  He had a clown mask, right?  Drill.  Drill Doe.  No, no.  No, no.  He had a drill, and he put it in his chick's pussy and started triggering it, and she is going  fucking nuts.  So it spins? 
[03:23:00]  Berserk.  Yeah, it spins, and then he was working it in and out.  You want to hear it?  Yeah.  And she had...  But it would be the hottest thing ever if it wasn't for her horrid Jersey or Long Island  accent.  I don't know what it is, but listen to this fucking...  Treat me like you are.  I want to be you.  It's so fucking unsexy, her voice, but she is screaming.  Sounds like fucking Laverne.  Yeah. 
[03:23:30]  Here we go.  Why don't we play this?  How long is it?  It's long.  Four minutes?  Four minutes.  That's good.  But hey, if you haven't heard this, enjoy.  Sit back and enjoy.  It's all the real deal.  We're not going to wrap up the show until we feel very happy with, you know, the heterosexuality  that's floating in.  Any girl out there with a fucking electric toothbrush, please rub it on your cliff.  And girls, call up.  We'll give you a fucking boombox.  Yeah, because we want a new one.  I mean, a lot of the listeners have heard this a bunch of times, but for Bob, here it is. 
[03:24:00]  Drill done.  Oh, God.  Yeah, I want the drill.  Oh, please.  Good.  Go ahead, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  I want the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, God.
