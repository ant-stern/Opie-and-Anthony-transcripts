<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a chaotic Ron and Fez segment dominated by Ron Bennington's furious tirade against his staff for their repeated playlist errors.  He employed highly offensive language, violent imagery, and sexually suggestive comments, threatening self-harm (jokingly) with a knife.  The segment featured numerous profane caller interactions, Ron's Vietnam War analogy about his staff "going native," and a recurring comedic bit with a recording of intern Molly singing childish songs, which ultimately calmed him.  Jay Moore called in, engaging in darkly humorous conversation with Ron.  The segment concluded with a failed attempt at "Hum Along With Hicks," a game where they struggled to identify songs based on Hicks' humming.  The show incorporated numerous movie and cultural references.

The show then transitioned to a "Hum Along With Hicks" segment featuring Chris Stanley's hilariously inept humming, punctuated by crude and offensive language, including homophobic slurs. This was followed by a discussion on NFL player celebrations, with hosts and callers expressing varying opinions and using strong language.  The conversation covered player disrespect, rule enforcement, and historical context. A phone call with author Dr. Jerry Barker discussed his book publishing and observations on college football's popularity in NYC, followed by further discussion on NFL celebrations and sportsmanship.  A segment on the pricing for a website connecting athletes with fans for paid experiences (dinners, coaching sessions, Bar Mitzvahs, etc.) then followed, including discussion about various athletes and who the hosts would choose for dinner. The show briefly introduced Michael Palmieri and Donald Mosher, co-directors of the documentary "Off Label" about the pharmaceutical industry, for a short interview.

Ron and Fez then discussed their film on the pharmaceutical industry, focusing on the pervasive nature of drug use driven by direct-to-consumer marketing. They detailed "Ask Your Doctor" campaigns, drug rep incentives, and the overprescription of drugs like Zoloft, Adderall, and OxyContin.  The conversation included anecdotes about prescription drug dependency, veterans' reliance on the VA, and personal experiences with painkillers, including discussions about addiction and withdrawal. A caller shared his experience with overprescription and its effects. The segment shifted to an upcoming "Unmasked" segment featuring Tom Shadyac, discussing his life change after giving away his fortune. The conversation included tangents about a scalp massager, a listener’s frustration with children in restaurants, and an anecdote about Eastside Dave's low pain tolerance.  Tom Shadyac was announced as the next "Unmasked" guest.

The final segment discussed contentment, Tom Shadyac's philanthropy, and other wealthy philanthropists, contrasting them with Milton Hershey.  The show then moved to a segment on "Lovable Losers"—defunct brands like the Sega Dreamcast, Polaroid cameras, PLTs facial cleanser, Oreo O's, Surge soda, Flip cameras, and Trio TV.  The discussion included tangents on the Amish and Mennonites, a caller's Hershey Park experience, and an extended discussion about the fallout from an incident involving Troy Kwan and Fez, revealing Fez's role in attempts to get Troy fired. The show concluded with promotions for upcoming events, including a live appearance with Tom Shadyac and Chris Stanley's birthday celebration, interspersed with musical interludes and off-color humor.

I actually think it's from...  My sister said it's from Arthur  I don't remember but... 
[00:32:00]  Oh, the little cartoon show?  Yeah, the Arthur...  I guess he's an aardvark  It was from a cartoon and I did my own rendition  Alright, let me take a listen  I had my breakfast  I got my books  So at the time you didn't know that your parents thought this was the funniest  Dumbest thing a child could do  And I used to do this all the time  They're like...  Probably over like 20 recordings of me  Just like doing these little ditties 
[00:32:30]  This is also making me feel better  I had my breakfast  I got my books  Alright, now this already kills me, Chris  JJ knew how to make me feel better  Yeah  And then Molly comes in and says  Here's an embarrassing thing from when I was a child  Run with it, I want you to feel better  This is the kind of sacrifice I'm looking for  And this is why  Jay Moore's parents  Never got divorced 
[00:33:00]  Because that kid had so much material  And energy that he held that family together  Here's Jay in Huntington  You're on the Ronny Fez show  Hey Ronnie B, what's going on man?  Yeah  I've been trying to get our buddy Liz set fire  To come back up to New York ever since she went down to Florida  So I'm thinking  You know, if she runs the show as smoothly as she does over the internet  Imagine what she could do in studio  The thing about Liz is she cares 
[00:33:30]  Exactly  I care very much  She has managed to put my hopes and dreams  Above drugs  Above alcohol  And above a fake cough  It's not fake, it's a smoker's cough  Is it?  Yes  You can hear the phlegm in my throat  I can't fake that  I don't know what Fez did to me  He gave me this cough  It's called gay meningitis my friend  I don't want gay meningitis  Speaking of Fez, you're the producer of this show 
[00:34:00]  35 minutes he hasn't said a word  And yet he feels safe about sitting there  Let me hear the breakfast song because I'm getting a headache again  Okay  I had my breakfast  I got my books  Now here's what kills me about that little kid  She's attempting to hold notes like it's really good  She loves it  That's the thing about kids  They think they draw well  And they think they sing well  They're constantly showing up  Wait till you hear the next one 
[00:34:30]  The next one there's like some vocal riffs going on  Hicks tries to blow us all the way through the whole thing  Without thinking  All right  Now tell us about the next song that you have for us  The next one is from  I was obsessed with the Land Before Time series  It's like a movie series about dinosaurs  And this was like a song called The Lone Dinosaur  About a dinosaur that just roamed the plains  All right hold on  So this was also a movie?  Yeah  Called the what?  It was a Land Before Time movie 
[00:35:00]  Oh there was a bunch of those?  Oh yeah  And then one of the songs from one of the movies was The Lone Dinosaur  Now did you think you played dinosaur all the time when you were little?  Yes, I was obsessed  Loved dinosaurs  All right let's hear it  The Lone Dinosaur  All right stop it already  Stop it already  That's the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life  Listen to the coughs you're getting  People are so excited  I'm excited  You're getting a standing coughing ovation 
[00:35:30]  Oh this is actually helping  This is helping my head  All right The Lone Dinosaur is the name of the song  Yeah and my dad  Like completely botched the spelling of both words  And like the title of the file  Musicians can't spell it  That's really funny  Yeah  He spelled it Lone L-O-A-N  Oh god  Dinosaur  D-I-N-A-S-O-R  Oh my god  Here's the thing 
[00:36:00]  You were little kids  So we're gonna give you the opportunity  But he acts like he was also five  All right here's The Lone Dinosaur  The Lone Dinosaur  The Lone Dinosaur  Dinosaur  Dinosaur  His tail was swift as lightning  Dinosaur  His heart was pretty made pure  Dinosaur  Whenever there was danger  He'd be there to fight the carnivore  The Lone Dinosaur 
[00:36:30]  That's really good  It's so awful  That's not the ego on little kids though  Dinosaur  Just trying to hold it  As if they're breaking your heart with it  God that's funny  Was there someone around that could teach you to spell when you're little though?  Yes  All right let's take another listen  The Lone Dinosaur  Dinosaur  His tail was swift as lightning  Dinosaur 
[00:37:00]  His heart was pretty made pure  Dinosaur  Whenever there was danger  He'd be there to fight the carnivore  The Lone Dinosaur  He'd be there to find the carnivore?  To fight  The carnivore  That's good lyrics  What kind of things do they teach a kid?  What kid wants to think  The dinosaur needs to fight the carnivore?  The carnivore  He's gonna get eaten 
[00:37:30]  If he tries to fight a carnivore  There he is  Yes!  The big cat  What time is it?  11.39  11.39  Here's the other thing I love about it though  No, hey, I haven't been around for a while but I got a line  Just doing the sniper line from the top of the roof  I love that  Let's hear the Lone Dinosaur one more time  The Lone Dinosaur  Dinosaur  His tail was swift as lightning 
[00:38:00]  Dinosaur  His tail was brave and pure dinosaur  Whenever there was danger  He'd be there to fight the carnivore  The Lone Dinosaur  I also like the little boss  He'd be there to fight the carnivore  Well I think you lost some confidence that you were going to be able to pull it off  Oh, that's funny  Alright  The Lone Dinosaur is the name of that song 
[00:38:30]  Maybe I'll just like send in a bunch of these and then if there's ever like a rough day  We'll just play like new ones every time  See, this is what I'm worried  When you go back to Boston College  I'm going to be like one of those gorillas that walks around with a dead goddamn cat  Sorry, I'm thinking of this, it's baby  And I always try to laugh at those dumb gorillas  Like hey, she still thinks it's alive  Sad  I know, but that's where I live, here in the gorilla pit 
[00:39:00]  Oh man  You know, I feel really, those are really nice things Jay said to me  Jim, where's the man? He's a good man  He's a good man  All the time people write to me  Jay brought you up in the last  Jay and Tom Rhodes always bring me up  I'll say the truth  Jay Moore does a lot more than Tom Rhodes  And Tom never brought me up when he had a TV show  That would have been nice  If he would have just dropped my name in the middle of a sitcom 
[00:39:30]  Dinosaur!  Gonna fight the carnivore  Ugh  Mike, you're on the run of a show  A million bucks, Ronnie  With all the screw ups around you  I never thought we would get a song that topped  Which came first?  When Miss Wiley just did it  It's what happened first  Do you ever notice that Shelby never brings in cute stuff?  From when he was a kid and neither does the other guy 
[00:40:00]  I don't know if he has  Maybe Ba does  I don't think Shelby would have anything cute  He might have just been born evil  I think he just hatched out of some goddamn shell  Just fucking  He was probably growing in a lab  Just fucking calling out like a black crow  Dinosaur  Dinosaur  I want to hear the dinosaur song one more time  Then I can move on  The lone dinosaur 
[00:40:30]  Dinosaur  Dinosaur  His tail was swift as lightning  Dinosaur  His heart was brave and pure  Dinosaur  Whenever there was danger  He'd be satisfied with the carnivore  The lone dinosaur  You know what kills me?  Is like some guy  Had real rock and roll dreams  Ended up writing for 
[00:41:00]  A straight to home video thing for little kids  And he's writing to Dinosaur  Dinosaur  What rhymes with dinosaur?  Fuck the door  Carnivore  Carnivore  That also was a dinosaur  Perfect  And then somebody probably came in and yelled  Did you say anything about the lightning fast tail?  Cause that's what we're selling to the kids  His tail was swift as lightning  It really was  Dinosaur 
[00:41:30]  I liked the first song  But that dinosaur song  Forget about it  That was fucking strong  That was really  You were Hotel California  That's when you peaked  And you know what?  I bet your dad was just  You know, sitting there  He's got his sax  Just like in the corner  He's looking over at a fucking billboard magazine  Seeing about the tour that his band's on without him  Cause he dropped out and started having these kids  They don't care  They don't care that he was on the road as a jazz man  He had a dream 
[00:42:00]  He had a guy in a dream  He had the funniest gig last weekend  I was dying  He played with the mystic horns  At the Portuguese Holy Ghost Society annual pig roast  Mmm  That's good food  Any free food?  Yeah, well it was free for me  It was not free for other people  So you showed up at the gig?  Yeah I did  Me and my sister  See, your dad would have been on the road right now  Playing big venues 
[00:42:30]  But he had kids  Did you see that condom commercial that we have up?  On the iBang  It's like the world's only honest commercial  It's wonderful  It's like the most truthful thing ever  And  Here it is  Just a guy  Watching children destroy his life  All because he didn't bag it 
[00:43:00]  He's in a place of pain  Yeah, so the kids keep hurting his scrotum  Really it's a scrotum the gum  And it's missing anything in the first place  Yeah, this  It's so truthful  This speaks to me  This is why I don't want that children  You're already at the age now 30  Where you don't want to  Perfect  Because you don't want to hit the age  That when your kids are in high school 
[00:43:30]  They can beat you up  That seems weird  When we do it like having kids older and older these days  At least it seems like it  Yeah  And then you turn around and there's a man in your house  And you can't defend yourself  Holy shit, this kid got really fucking  You spend your life like fucking George Zimmerman  Just walking around with a gun  Ready to shoot him in the fucking chest  Oh 
[00:44:00]  Matt and Canada, you're on the run of Fez show  Hey, what's going on guys?  Yeah  Um, I'm just wondering if  You know, your dad was just really bad at spelling  Or if he thought that  Land Before Time was about a dinosaur that loaned out money  Or some sort of prehistoric loan shark or something  I just want to also point this out, her dad's Canadian  So, they don't have a good public school system  Sherlock Before Time  It's hard to understand your  For a long time 
[00:44:30]  It's really hard  Because in Canada  A lot of the teachers are talking  But they lost their teeth in hockey games  So you can't always understand them  About  About  About  And then they put in their false teeth  About  Oh, there it is  That's what it was  Oh  Here's a guy expected to cheer me up  But I gotta have movie stars do it  I'd write Jenny  I just had to 
[00:45:00]  A, I need that song as my ringtone on my phone  With her singing it  And B, when you look it up  I found it on YouTube  She actually sounds better than the person singing it on the cartoon  Oh, I didn't know that was up on YouTube  I didn't either  Listen here  This is the actual version from the show  I prefer Molly  Now, it's the amazing thing  I got all these producers  Not one of them thought to do what Johnny did  Hey, I wonder if we can find the real thing on YouTube 
[00:45:30]  Johnny, Earl was in here the other day  Oh, he talks crazy talk, that Earl  Don't lay him off, please  Well, I didn't want him hanging out by you more often  No  No  Maybe he'd cheer you up  Ugh  Was he just fucking nutty?  Yeah, he's fucking nutty  I don't know what the hell he's talking about  You know, I just, I implanted that in his head, right?  Yeah, of course  I go like this, you okay with the layoffs? 
[00:46:00]  I hope so  He was nervous at the end  Yeah, he freaked out  First of all, he doesn't, from working in radio  He doesn't want to let on that there's anything that he hadn't heard already  Looks that way  And I go, is Johnny gone?  Hope not, cause he does great  And he was just like, it's all happening  I'm out  I'm on the bubble  Poor Earl  He does it to himself  Yeah, he does it to himself 
[00:46:30]  That's true  He was practicing his swing again in the meeting yesterday  Why don't you scream at him?  No, let him have some fun  He's worried about getting laid off  Yeah, that's a good idea  Well, he's worried about getting laid off or hit by a pitch  It's the two things that concern him  Oh, that Earl  Oh, that Earl  Alright, Johnny  Ronnie, cheer up, buddy  No, I'm getting there  Maybe I'll come by and see you tomorrow  And I'll cheer you up a little  Oh, that'd be great 
[00:47:00]  We were gonna have a party for Chris  I've been thinking about canceling it  Oh, Jesus Christ  Yeah, I'll come in, you don't need a party  You know why I was thinking about canceling it, Chris?  Why?  Meanness  Just pure meanness  Fuck  Alright, talk to you later, Johnny  Bye-bye, boys  You raised that pips to kill me  I swear to God, I've never had anyone  That I worked for or with  That I talked to less than pips 
[00:47:30]  Days go by  I don't even get a hello out of him  And he sits there in the dark  I cannot even see him from this point of view  Today when I spoke directly to him  It took him a fez amount of time to answer me back  Yeah  I'll tell you something else that happened to you, Samson  He's cutting that hair  Nah, that's been weird since the  Since it got sheared  You turned into one of them  No, don't say that 
[00:48:00]  A suit?  Yeah  Don't you say that word around here, Molly  Sorry  That's the suits, kids  The suits are different than us  Yes  What was that  Michael's show  He, it was like  Before  I gotta think of it  I know it had to have him  He came from Iowa  Michael J. Fox  And  He 
[00:48:30]  Got a job  And then pretended he was a suit  Because he got a job in the mailroom  And the guy in the mailroom was like  Don't hang out with the suits  They're different than us  All day long  All I ever talked about was suits  Secret of my success?  That's it  Thank you, Johnny  For looking that up  I think we should break and restart the show  Okay  Can we put the real playlist up?  We're gonna restart  Yes  I'm going to handle it personally  Like you should've?  Yes, like I should've this morning  Yes 
[00:49:00]  Was there no pre-show meeting today?  There was a pre-show meeting  But the playlist did not come up  Even though that was the fuck up the day before  The day before  Funny  It's not funny  It's just  It's bad work  Is what it is  I'm gonna have Fez put it  It was a report  Fuck  I had thought  I thought the reports were like  Slowing down a little bit  No  The report should be  Me and Chris are trying to kill Ron  No, don't you put that  Fuck that shit 
[00:49:30]  You honestly don't believe that that's true  No  I'm not trying to kill you  I heard it from one of your interns  Really?  Which one of you fucking scumbags  Talking shit?  That's the way you talk to people?  If they're fucking talking to Tate  Then tell me the truth  Sometimes the truth comes out, Chris  That's garbage  It's not you, Molly, is it?  No way  Of course not  Not me  Alright, good, then you're not a fucking scumbag  Thanks 
[00:50:00]  I will tell you this  You're not a fucking scumbag either  I am  None of us are  I am  The dark prince  You ought to be proud of yourself  I can't be proud of myself  For fucking massive fuck ups  That should never fucking happen  I can't  If you're proud of that  Then you are a dark prince  You know what you did today?  What?  You kicked me through the barbershop window  I don't know  That was the beauty of it  Oh  And that means you're gonna be ready for your own career  I guess I'll become born again with detectives  You followed me back to the apartment  And you undid that light bulb 
[00:50:30]  So when I start to screw it back in  I just saw you standing there with a towel around a shotgun  And you put it right in my chest  Congratulations  I can't be congratulated  You're the new godfather  Oh, Jesus  Dinosaur!  That's a good song  Well, Chris  Yeah  At least you apologized 
[00:51:00]  I'll give you all the credit in the world for that  I apologize as well  Who's that?  Who just said something?  Me, Fez  Where have you been?  I've been right here  Oh  So was Chris apologizing for both of you?  I think he was apologizing for the whole team  But I should apologize too  I know  I just said that  Just to get you to talk  I don't give a shit if anybody apologizes 
[00:51:30]  I give all the credit in the world  You raised Chris  Chris raised Pips  You guys got me  I'm proud of you in a lot of ways  My last dying breath  I'm proud of you  No, don't  You should be proud of this  Hey  I'm the Lone Dinosaur  And you guys are the carnivores  What do you have that lightning quick tail?  When you need money, come to the Lone Dinosaur  Low rates  Thanks Lone Dinosaur  Payday loan service 
[00:52:00]  Payday loan service  This is a great idea  The Lone Dinosaur  I have such a clear picture in my head of what the Lone Dinosaur would look like  Sometimes I get a clear picture of your head  If your dad wouldn't have had kids and he could have went out and bid David Sanborn  David Sanborn  Just didn't have kids  That's all he did  That was the smart move  Yeah, I don't know  I hope he doesn't regret having kids 
[00:52:30]  He does  Every time he's sitting there haggling over metal  With somebody in fucking Europe  Just take the metal  You need it to build things with  Everyone does  God dammit, here's the price, buy it  He would be the worst salesman  Yeah, I would be, it would be terrible  Buy this or I kill you is what you'd have on your fucking card  I have a good idea  I have a gasoline in this fucking office of mine  Yeah, that's why I would be  Bad at most straight jobs  Cause I didn't give a shit whether people bought anything or not 
[00:53:00]  It really doesn't matter to me  Gotta get that commission  I know plenty to do with the sales  Doesn't matter what they sell  It really doesn't matter  They're just the salesman, you know?  Yeah, well that's most, I mean the product doesn't matter if the salesman's good  Yeah  Do you see the thing on the iBang about  The guy who posted his commission on Instagram and then got canned?  No, I didn't see this  They didn't like it cause they didn't want everyone to know what his commission was 
[00:53:30]  This fucking internet gets everybody fired  This guy was the number one, he worked for Lacoste  Number one salesman in the country  He was the number one salesman in the entire goddamn company  Posted his commission check on  What was his commission check?  I think it was like $12,000  Nice  A fat check, it was nice  For that month, right?  And he posts it  And then like underneath the bitch is like  This is my paycheck and even if I'm even making all this money  I'm still, you know, with kids living in New York City  I'm gonna be broke 
[00:54:00]  And then someone on his Instagram account  Dived him out to Lacoste  And they're like, you signed a confidentiality agreement  Regarding social media, you're fired  Well, that's what happens  Yeah  If he did  That's a rough one  Well, if he's the number one salesman in the country  I think somebody else is gonna wanna fucking hire him  I'd let him work for me and fucking post all kinds of shit  He can post wiener dick pictures for all I care  Just keep fucking moving that merch 
[00:54:30]  Yep, there's the check  Now he's out of work  ABC, always be closing  Closing  Alec Baldwin said it was best  Who?  Alec Baldwin  I called him Alec Baldwin  Baldwin  You're the fucking lone dinosaur  I am  A carnivore should come by and just bite my fucking head off  You fucking got me today, Fredo  You fucking got me  I feel like kissing you on the cheek  I don't wanna be Fredo  I know it was you, Fredo  I don't wanna be Fredo 
[00:55:00]  You broke my heart  Fuck  Where my wife sleeps  Where my children come play with their toys  That part of it where he just gets very quiet  Like they're gentle  I don't wanna yell about them  Amazing  It's nice  I don't know  I don't think it was that good  Who's awesome?  What are you talking about?  The only Godfather I like is Godfather 3  The third one's the one you like  Yeah  They're pulling me back in 
[00:55:30]  The helicopter scene  I'm in a  I'm in this  Thing where I'm not even sure about film  Anything anymore  I don't know if I even wanna be involved  I think I only wanna listen to music  I don't wanna watch any films  I don't wanna watch any TV shows  I'm done with it  You've continued on your music kick?  Yeah, music and books  Nice  I do them both together at the same time  I'm listening to this new album  It's called Lone Dinosaur  It doesn't 
[00:56:00]  Like there's something that gets me about it  I don't love it yet  Yeah  But it haunts me  The Lone Dinosaur  Dinosaur  His tail was switched as lightning  Dinosaur  His heart was breathing pure  Dinosaur  Whenever there was danger  He'd be there to find the crocodile  The Lone Dinosaur  Take it back  She almost gurgles to death on 
[00:56:30]  On his last line  Whenever there was danger  He'd be there to find the crocodile  The Lone Dinosaur  That must have been congestive or something  She's just gurgling on her little phleg  Alright, you sang the dinosaur song  Time to get you up dead steps  And get to sleep  All dinosaurs need their sleeps, Molly  Watch out for carnivores  Right?  Put you in your dinosaur bed 
[00:57:00]  Oh, isn't that nice  I had a little niece  When she came up to New York  She was like obsessed with dinosaurs  And had dinosaur cards  And she would go like this  She would lay down all the cards  And go, what's your favorite?  So I would point one  She would go, try them out  Which meant do an impression of it  So I would point and go, this one's my favorite  Try them out  All day long 
[00:57:30]  Same thing over and over  One of them could have been the Lone Dinosaur  Why do you think little kids like dinosaurs so much?  Because they do  Yeah  Because they're gigantic  All little kids  Boys, girls  Like 2 year olds  To like 12 year olds  Do you think it's because they're afraid  So they act like they like them?  Because they are monsters  No, I think it's because you can  It's cool because they don't actually exist anymore  Okay, if they did exist  Yeah, if you did 
[00:58:00]  People are afraid of spiders and sharks and stuff  Because they're real  But here's something scary that doesn't exist  That's a really good premise  If something is extinct  Is it still real?  If it doesn't exist right now  Is it real?  Maybe everyone's just been making up dinosaurs this whole time  Now you sound like a Christian  Yeah, they're planting those  The devil goes out and he plants a big old dinosaur head  To confuse people  I don't think they're real anymore if something's extinct 
[00:58:30]  Because it literally doesn't exist  Now  But time doesn't exist either  They can't really  You can't figure out how that exists  But here's the premise  We could also bring them back in a very Jurassic Park type way  We didn't do that with the woolly mammoth  That's just a start for us  Yeah  Then we bring back the lone dinosaur  Oh, thank God  You having money problems?  You don't need to 
[00:59:00]  Come to the lone dinosaur  Was that guy's name Matt or Mike?  I didn't think it was Matt  By the way, did you have any idea of the impressions that Jay Moore was doing?  No, I'm not going to lie  There's a movie called Reservoir Dogs  and this character, nice guy, Eddie, which  Sean Penn's younger brother who passed away, Chris Penn did it  And as far as I know, Jay's the only person who does that impression 
[00:59:30]  Which always kills me just to be the first at doing an impression  Not the last person doing a Jack Nicholson  And it always makes me happy  That's his lone dinosaur with me  Matt, you're on the Rhino Fez show  Ronnie B, I was just going to say that whole premise might be why religion is so popular  Because, you know, he just doesn't really exist anymore 
[01:00:00]  Maybe that's why people love him  He can't let you down?  Yeah, if you follow Fez's logic  You know, Babe Ruth isn't real  Because he doesn't exist, yeah  World War II is not real, it doesn't exist  The idea, this always kills me  Well, you can go back and watch those fucking cowboy movies from like the 1940's  Where you know everyone's dead 
[01:00:30]  And those same mountains are there  Or if you watch Breakfast at Tiffany's  Or any New York movies in the 1940's  5th Avenue and 57th Street looks the same  You look at Tiffany's  And all those people are dead  And Tiffany's is still there  It always fucking weirds me out  That is fucking tripped out a little bit  Like anybody who made the Empire State Building  Is probably as dead as the Egyptians that made the pyramids 
[01:01:00]  But their buildings still exist, they made that  Unlike our fucking job  Which exists for a second  And then is gone forever  Best summer of our lives  Bullshit  What the hell is your problem?  We wasted our lives  Talking  Can you imagine the size of the building we could have built by now  If we would have been doing something  Instead of sitting around fucking Jabberjawing all day  Sirius XM construction 
[01:01:30]  Maybe they should switch  Let's build something  Let's make like a  Toothpick bridge or something  Are you fucking kidding me?  I assume they're all made of toothpicks  You're always a little bit of sunshine fess  He always thinks buildings are going to fall down  He thinks this building is going to fall down  I feel like this one  I'm getting a good vibe from this one  Watch, this is always 
[01:02:00]  I can do this to make it a bit  If you just fall back like the building is going  Makes my head spin with vertigo  That's how easy it is  All you're going to do is get up and act like you're falling into the wall  And he's gone  Remember earthquake day?  Yeah, we were actually up here when the earthquake hit  Oh really?  And we're all just sitting here  And then it feels like the building is going up and down like a basketball  Like very very slightly  Like a wave  I didn't get it there, I just felt like a little bounce like up and down 
[01:02:30]  Instead of like not a sway back and forth  And I'm like, did anyone feel that?  Because all I'm thinking of  Did some 9-11 just hit here?  And I looked down the hall  This window was open  And I saw that everybody in the hall  Was just frozen  Like just standing there  And I bring it up and Fez just goes  Uh oh  Which was funny because 
[01:03:00]  He was much more serious and calm than in a regular panic  Yeah  Like you know how  Much Fez panics and every day is a bad day  9-11  He didn't panic  He watched the building fall  Didn't panic  Came to work  Didn't panic  Felt a little sad and  You know upset like everybody else  But not more than everyone else  Hmm  No one knows how anyone's gonna react to anything  Yeah I guess not  Back then I considered him the lone dinosaur 
[01:03:30]  Yesterday afternoon on the 37th floor  I just, I had a panic where I just really  Became very aware of being 37 stories in the air  Yeah  You have that feeling  Oh no  Jay in Canada, you're on the Ren and Fez show

[01:12:00]  Thank you.  Matt, you got an answer for I'm Along With Hicks.  Hello? 
[01:12:30]  You got an answer.  Is that Hicks dying or is that Tina Turner, I Will Survive?  Neither one.  George, you're on the run of Fez Show.  Yes, is it?  As with the centaur in A minor.  Rich, you have an answer.  All right, I believe it's What Happened First.  Mark, do you have an answer?  Yeah, Fez is a cock sucking faggot.  That's the answer.  I think that's the question.  Matt, you're on the run of Fez Show.  You know, I'm already telling him on the wrong one. 
[01:13:00]  Was the last one great?  No, that was the last time.  Bo, you're on run of Fez.  I have no idea.  He sucks.  I have no idea.  He's terrible.  What?  He does.  What?  He's...  All right, now, Chris, I want you to just sing along.  Okay.  Sing along with Chris.  See if it's that easier.  Easy.  Make it easy.  Oh.  I know what it is. 
[01:13:30]  I love that.  That's you singing?  No, no, there's no song.  I'm just doing the guitar part.  Oh, okay.  See, that's what a lot of people don't hum to, the parts that...  I think he hums to things in the background.  I think he hums to the drums.  I switch it up, you know?  Depends.  I know what I'm feeling in that song at that time.  I think the scary thing is this is what Hicks hears in his head all day.  Oh, my gosh.  Yeah.  For him, it's like perfect.  Yeah.  I'm running down low, and I'm living my load.  All right, turn it up. 
[01:14:00]  Turn it up as loud as you can, and then sing along.  I'm loving, don't hold them over.  I'm on my own side.  It easy.  Take it easy.  Oh, no, no, there's something in my...  You can't even sing along with it.  Oh, no, yeah, baby, maybe.  Oh, no, no, no, there's something in my life as long as you save me. 
[01:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  That was from the crowd, though.  All right, sing along with this song.  Okay.  No one got it yet? 
[01:15:00]  No.  It sounds like they're speaking another language.  It's one of the most famous songs in the world.  I need to meet you.  Oh.

[01:17:30]  My sex change operation got botched.  My guardian angel fell asleep on the watch.  Now all I've got is a bobby dog cross.  I've got an angry inch.  Six inches, four inches, five inches back.  I've got an angry inch. 
[01:18:00]  Six inches, four inches, five inches back.  I've got an angry inch.  I'm from the land where you still hear the cries.  I have to get out to several times.  I've changed my name and assumed a disguise.  I've got an angry inch.  Six inches, four inches, five inches back.  I've got an angry inch.  Six inches, four inches, five inches back.  I've got an angry inch. 
[01:18:30]  Six inches, four inches, five inches back.  The stranger's coming and I'm tied to the track.  That's not all yellow, but I can't get no black.  I've got an angry inch.  My mama made my tits out of clay.  My boyfriend told me that he'd take me away.  They dragged me to the doctor one day.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.

I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  I've got an angry inch.  Long story short.  Yeah.  Long story short.  When I woke up from the operation  I was bleeding down there  I was bleeding from the gash between my legs  It was my first day as a woman  Already that time of the month  Two days later the hole closed up 
[01:19:30]  You know, the wound healed and I was left  With a one-inch mound of flesh  Where my penis used to be, where my vagina never was  It was a one-inch mound of flesh  With the scar running down it  Like a sideways grimace on an eyeless face  It was just a little buzz  It was not angry  Six inches, four inches, five inches back  The trend is coming and I'm tied to the track 
[01:20:00]  I try to get all along, can't get no slack  I got all angry, angry, angry, angry  Six inches, four, five inches back  The other color to the knife and the black  I got my inch, I'm set to attack  I got an angry inch, angry inch  That's a little bit of Hedwig  Not exactly the one off the movie 
[01:20:30]  But Hedwig and the angry inch  Coming to Broadway now after being a cult film for many, many years  All right, 866-RON-0-FEZ  866-RON-0-FEZ  We got an unmasked announcement coming up in just a couple of minutes  For the month of August 
[01:21:00]  This might be one of only two  That we will do this month  I'm hoping we get the other one as well  They can't seem to keep up with everything that's going on  Chris, could you look into that one for me?  You know the one, the legend?  All right  It didn't come up when we talked about it yesterday  Get a hold of Jerry Barker for me as well  All right 
[01:21:30]  I wanted to talk to him  Here's a kind of an interesting thing  It looks like football is getting rid of some of the celebrations  No  The spinning of the ball  No more  They've shit-canned it?  Yeah  They've shit-canned the spinning of the ball  I don't care one way or the other 
[01:22:00]  I mean, to me, I'd rather it slow the game down  And look like a fucking moron  What's the big deal?  You got a first down  Ochoa Cinco caught  He caught fines for all the shit he did, right?  For the fucking  Yeah  Yeah, that's the truth  I mean, you can do it  You're just going to get fined or penalized  So no one's stopping you from doing it  But just know that acting like an asshole 
[01:22:30]  And slowing down the game is going to cost you a little bit of money  And hopefully 15 yards  Whoa  Shit  And so they kick off anyway  All right  I always like the celebrations  I think it fires up the crowd  Why does the crowd need to be fired up?  They just got a touchdown  And a lot of times it happens in the other place  I didn't find  First of all, the celebrations now  The reason why they're doing away with it  It takes place now every first down  That you have to get the guy to fucking stand up 
[01:23:00]  And point with the ball  Yeah  Just because he got a first down  Stupid  No, there's a block  There's a celebration as well  Yeah, I mean, that is the perfect thing  Just why isn't the center  Oh, I just fucking snapped a perfect thing for him to punt  Now it's time for me to roll on the ground  And take my belly out  I think any crowd that needs to be fired up by that  Are not a football crowd  They're at best a wrestling crowd 
[01:23:30]  It's worse  It's just the worst  When teams are just like down  Bad  And you know  They're not coming back  And they're celebrating  Oh no, I'm super bad  Yeah  We're down 31-10  I scored  Look, I'm ripping this open  I'm super bad  Those are the reasons why they're getting rid of him  Is because the guys do not use them properly  And you can't depend upon them to use them properly  They should feel bad  Cannot celebrate a first fucking down  That is stupid 
[01:24:00]  Even the stupidest people  Who really would rather watch dancing than football  Have to admit that's dumb  Alright, let's go over to Dr. Jerry Barker  Jerry  Ron, how are ya?  I pitched JJ today  I heard that  I was actually listening on a delay  Thank you very much for that  The only thing is  He goes, what year was that?  Which, you know  That's one of the problems  That you're running into with this, right?  I just 
[01:24:30]  I think the biggest problem  Is that I'm an unknown author  You're known, buddy  I thought what he said was hilarious  What was that?  He said something in 1869  And then did the Jackie Robinson  I was laughing at  That was very funny  Well, he's gonna  You know  We got to pitch into him  But he will be  You know  He's gonna talk all over you  If you're gonna be honest about it  You won't get a word in edgewise  Nothing back from Al Dukes, right?  Still staying with him  I listen to you guys all the time  Fuck  No, nothing 
[01:25:00]  I think that one's done  I don't get that  I don't get the guys in New York  Saying that  No one cares about college football  I don't get it either  I think they do care about it  And the brand of Notre Dame  I think they care about  For sure  I would guarantee you  If you went through New York City  And said  What's the number one team  College-wise  Because of the amount of Catholics  You know  If you  You know  Let's face it  If you like Ohio State  You either  A. went there 
[01:25:30]  Or B. grew up in Ohio  If you like Notre Dame  It just means that you grew up Catholic  Yeah, pretty much  I mean  I'll tell you something funny  The Notre Dame Alumni Club  In Staten Island  Isn't even made up of alums  It's all subway alums  And they have a fully  Functioning club  Of people who just love Notre Dame  Yes  Which I think is pretty bizarre  But need it at the same time  I was taught to like  Notre Dame when I was a kid  And there wasn't anybody  I ever knew  That went there  There's a list of like six 
[01:26:00]  Just off the top of  There's a Google search  Sixty college football bars  In New York  And I'm sure they're all filled  Every fucking weekend  With people watching them  I have them  In my neighborhood  There's some really bizarre colleges  I mean why would you want  To get together  With people from your home  When you live in New York  You like to get together  With people from  Where you grew up  To cheer together  It's kind of a fun thing  Makes the city  Seem a little smaller  What do you think  About this celebration thing?  Okay 
[01:26:30]  I think it's the NFL's way  Of just trying to  Create themselves  As the establishment  And the players  As the rebels  I really do  Because it's ridiculous  The changes that are being made  I guess is  If it's done to an opponent  You know  If it's done in the opponent's face  But did they really need  To even make  I just don't see the need  To make this rule  I think it's a way of saying  Look  We the owners are going to get together  And we're going to  Reign things in  Well I think it's because  They have guys doing it 
[01:27:00]  On first downs  And they also have guys  Doing it  When their team's  Losing by 20  Which makes it look like  They don't care  That they're losing  They care about themselves  I love the expression  Individuality in the game  I think it's  I always found it to be  Fucking just horse shit  And fucking babyish  I did  The fact  You know  Hicks had the  Best point of view  You don't see  Every time a guy blocks 
[01:27:30]  He's up  Fucking doing  Popping  He's not fucking  Popping  And doing the worm  It's just dumb  If you're down  Right  And you score a touch  Say you're down 30  You score  You should just be  Fucking depressed  And sad  And focused  You should be glad  That something went right  But you're down 30  For your fans  Either in the stadium  Or at home  You're down 30  That would be like you  Getting off a line  And feeling like  I don't care about  The rest of the show  You know what I mean  You would be a bad  Fucking part of the team  If all you cared about 
[01:28:00]  Was yourself  So if you're like  On this show  And you got a laugh  At fucking  12  4  37  But the rest of the show  Was shit  But you're like  Yeah  Crushed it  We'd be like  I don't know if that  Fucking dude  Gives a shit  About his show  That's fucking  Embarrassing to me  And guess what  The other thing  You know what  The celebration  When you get your check  Because you're supposed 
[01:28:30]  To score fucking TDs  That's the point  Of you being on that team  But there are  I think it shows them  For who they are  When they do that  Kind of stuff  I mean there are guys  That  You know I've talked  To offensive linemen  Who can't stand  Running backs  That they've blocked for  Because  They would lose the game  By four points  And the guy  Fumbled twice  But he had two touchdowns  And after the game  That running back  Was feeling great  And talking up  About what a great game  He played  And it's just  That's who they are  As a human being  But when somebody 
[01:29:00]  Asks who they are  As a human being  Then other people  Have to say  Look you're not  Fucking fitting in  To what the game  Is about  And baseball  When a guy  Used to  Fucking hit a home run  And stare at it  And watch it  Leave the stadium  And slow walk  The next guy  Would catch a  Fucking ball  In the ear  Because you don't  Fucking treat us  Like that  You don't treat  The game like that  When the  Sack dances 
[01:29:30]  Started  The fucking  Offensive linemen  Ran at the  Fucking defensive linemen  And started  Fucking kicking  Their asses  Because you don't  Fucking treat us  Like  Are you turning this  Into something  Personal now  This isn't a job  Anymore  This is you  Taunting us  Fuck you  I would  Much rather  See  The guys  On the defense  When that guy  Started dancing  Than go fucking  Hit him after the fact  Go hit that  Motherfucker  For dancing in your  House like that  Great  And I agree with you 
[01:30:00]  I think that level  Of street justice  I think that's really  Good about the game  That you can  Get your shots  In  That's why you like  Trayvon  I can't even go there  I didn't watch the trial  So I don't know  But I do like hoodies  But I think  That was good for the game  But that's what's been  Taken out  Because it's always  The dude who retaliates  That's going to get  In trouble  Yeah that's the shit  That gets to me  Because he's to me  The stand up guy  He's the guy 
[01:30:30]  That respects the game  He's the guy  Who respects his team  Let me talk to somebody  I can normally depend  On the blowhard  First of all  Barca  Congratulations  Thank you sir  Thank you very much  With all the success  And if you want  To hit the New York market  I really suggest  You get Mike Francesa  Because he has authors  On all the time  Alright good call  Francesa  The morning show  They're goofballs  But Francesa  He does authors  And also  Go to ESPN radio  Michael Kay's show  Those guys talk 
[01:31:00]  College football  All the time too  Regarding this issue  Ronnie B  Bad sportsmanship  Is bad sportsmanship  And you know  This is the ESPN generation  Where people want to  Do these idiotic  Dances and celebrations  And on a first down  When they do that  Pointing and they  Drop the ball  I love it when a team  Is penalized for that  I love it when they  Take their helmets off  And get 15 yards  I think that  It's just  Something you're taught  As a young kid  Playing sports 
[01:31:30]  Is that you don't  Rub it in the other guy's face  I agree with that  And also  You're not bigger  Than the fucking game  You're not  And they want to  Make the highlight real  And you know  What makes me  Even sicker  Is when these guys  Choreograph  The touchdown dances  And stuff  You get the ball  You score  You hand the ball  Over to the ref  Barry Sanders  Did it that way  Act like you've  Been there before  And I'm so happy  That the league  Is cracking down  On this  I hate to say this 
[01:32:00]  It's a racist term  But shucking and jiving  In the end zone  Because it's just  It's idiotic  It's a time waster  You can't do it in college  But you know  This whole thing  Of express their personality  Express your personality  On the field  Gail Sayers  And fucking Barry Sanders  Didn't feel the need  To dance afterwards  They danced  When you were trying  To fucking tackle them  And that idiot  Mark Gastineau  Back in the day  I loved it  When he got punched  By Jackie Slater  That time 
[01:32:30]  I think it was  Jackie Slater  It was Jackie Slater  It was a Rams game  With Ferragamo  I remember that  Right  And as a Jet fan  I despised  That type of dance  And especially  When a team is losing  By a large amount  It just shows  It's all about  Me, me, me  And it's not the team  And if I was a coach  I would pull the guy  Put him on the bench  And bury him  And the league  Is finally doing  Something smart  For a change  I hate putting on ESPN  And watching highlights  And seeing some idiot 
[01:33:00]  Like when Chad Johnson  Ochoa Cinco  Was doing the river dance  And all that stupid shit  It's just  It's just bad sportsmanship  And then the kids copy it  The younger kids  In the younger leagues  They act like jackasses  Themselves  And when they score  It's like  In your face, buddy  As opposed to  Good, decent sportsmanship  Which is what it should be  All about  All right, thanks  Blowhard  I know I could  Get Blowhard  To be old school  On this  I think they got  I would prefer 
[01:33:30]  If you allowed  The players to retaliate  I think  Where this started  The guys catching  A four yard  Out pattern  For a first down  Really where it started  Was with the Miami  Hurricanes  In college  When they were the best  And Michael Irvin  Would sit there  And he'd do the  You know  The first down signal  And all of that  Kind of his  Hip gyrations  And you know  Here's the thing  And then remember  How everyone acted  Like the people  In Philly  Were animals  For clapping  When they thought  That he was hurt 
[01:34:00]  Bad  Well, he was hurt bad  But they thought  He was paralyzed  It's because  He's taunted them  For years  He's acted like  An asshole  Yeah, it's the ebb and flow  I mean, I think  That's a natural  Ebb and flow  To things, though  And it also  He said, beat me  Shut me up  But you're saying  What you're saying  Is jailhouse rules  I kind of  I mean, it is football  I mean, it is a game  Of violence  And yeah, I guess  I am  I've gone back  And you know this  And watching old games  And tapes  And you could see  Guys getting their shots in  Whereas you don't see 
[01:34:30]  That as much now  You know, if you hit  Somebody's quarterback late  You can guarantee  On the next drive  In these, you know  Games 25 years ago  That the other quarterback  Was getting hit back  He was going to  He was going to  Get some retaliation  Here's Ken in Georgia  You're on the  Run at Fez show  Ken  Yeah, man  Yeah  What's up, Ronnie?  Good  Hey, you know what?  There's parts of your argument  That I agree with  I mean, I think  You can go over the top  But goddamn, man  You've got to let  These fuckers be emotional 
[01:35:00]  It's an emotional game  And I take you  You never played  Because you don't know that  Well, I played when I was a kid  Wow  But I never played  On the level  That these guys  Are talking about  But the fact of the matter  Is, Ken  If you're going to  Be honest about it  It's easier to get  A touchdown now  Than any time in history  And it's easier  To get a first down now  Than any time  In history  They're already  Tying the defense's  Fucking hands  Behind their backs  Yeah  Look how embarrassing  The fucking Super Bowl 
[01:35:30]  Second half was  Last year  The fucking Ravens  Who were supposed to have  A great defense  Could not ice  That fucking game out  Because the game  Is so wide open  See, they make  But here's the problem  They make the whole game  A celebration  These teams come out  To fanfare  Confetti  They run out of  Smoke tunnels  There's a giant flag  Pushed across the field  The whole thing  Is a celebration  And now these guys  Are told  Oh, don't get excited  When you make a great play 
[01:36:00]  So, I don't see  Where the league  Is even being  Consisted on this  The problem that we have  If you even say  And stuff like that  Is that the sport  Because it's become  Entertainment  Has brought people  Into the thing  That aren't sports fans  They are entertainment fans  And what you're saying  Is that it's really  Entertainment  And it's not sport  And I'm saying  Let's get back  To making it a sport  I know we want  To have girls  Or people who 
[01:36:30]  Fucking don't care  About the game  Play and clap  When they're not sure  Who's who  But the fact of the matter  Is let's get back  And make it really  A sport again  Well, that's one of my  Biggest problems  With it though  Is they want to make it  This pure  Pretend it's some sort  Of safe sport  And it's not the violence  It is  And that's part  This is part of that  Ridiculousness  Because if they can  Flag this now  They're really  What they are interrupting  Is the retaliation  That if somebody  Does that  Because if there 
[01:37:00]  Were retaliation  Then the sport  Looks bad  And it doesn't  Play to the  Demographics  They're trying to get  And to me  That's the most  Disappointing thing  About it  It is what it is  It's a great sport  And it's a  Physical  Rough  Violent  In many ways  A mean person  Sport  To get after each other  The way they do  In the game  And that's what  They try and take  That's what they're  Taking out of it  Just like you said  About the Super Bowl  All the physical  Nature of it  Is what's getting  Removed  Jerry I've never  Heard of anyone  Else  That I know 
[01:37:30]  As a sports writer  Calling for more  Violence in the sport  This is very  Very interesting  I don't know  If I'm calling  For  I don't want  To say  You're calling  For retaliation  You're calling  For thug life  I am  Okay with the  Level of street  Justice  It will work  Itself out  If it doesn't  You know  Then you deal  With it  But I do  I think  That that's  Part of the game  I think  Now if everybody's  Going to act  Professional  And agree to act 
[01:38:00]  Professionally  I mean baseball  You brought up  A great example  With baseball  That you're going  To get one  In the ear  If you embarrass  But you can say  In baseball  All the time  Hey that one  Got away from me  No one will believe  You but you can say  You know  Sure  You can honestly say  Hey I was trying  To take it high inside  And I'm sorry  I missed by seven inches  Right in his jaw  Craig you're on  The Ron and Fez show  Hey Jerry still  There  Yes  Yeah  Have you ever

[01:55:00]  I  Was  Talking  To  Your  Boy  Donovan  McNabb  Yesterday  What  About  Well  About  The  Book  We  Were  On  The  Air  It  Was  Him  And  Mark  Malone  The  Former  Steelers  Quarterback  On  NBC  Sports  Radio  And  I  Thought  It  Was  Nice  That  Donovan  McNabb  Who  Grew  Up  In  Chicago  Remembered  You  Know  When  He  Was  Growing  Up  Watching  Tony  Rice  Play  Quarterback  For  The  Irish  I  Thought  That  Was  Pretty  Cool  Well  Why  Wouldn't  He  You  Know  I  Mean  Those  Guys  Are  Probably  The  Biggest  Sports  Fans  Ever  You  Know  Yeah  It  Was  Nice  I 
[01:55:30]  Think  Tony  Rice  Gets  Forgotten  A  Lot  Well  Because  He  Didn't  Have  A  Pro  Career  Yeah  He  Was  You  Know  In  This  Country  Yeah  Well  I  Mean  He  Played  In  The  World  Football  League  But  He  Didn't  Play  In  Canada  And  So  But  In  The  World  Football  League  I  Think  It  Was  One  Season  It  Might  Not  Have  Even  Been  A  Full  Season  And  But  I  Think  When  You  Look  At  People  Think  Of  Tommy  Frazier  They  Think  Of  Jamel  Holloway  At  Oklahoma  And  Tony  Rice  Was  28  And  3  As  A  Starter  For  Notre  Dame  And  Really  The  First  Full 
[01:56:00]  Time  Black  Starting  Quarterback  At  Notre  Dame  They  Had  A  Guy  Cliff  Brown  Start  A  Few  Games  Because  Of  Injuries  In  The  Early  70s  But  He  Moved  To  Halfback  The  Following  Year  I  Just  Think  It's  A  Real  Interesting  Story  I  Was  Psyched  At  Donovan  What  Do  You  Think  Is  To  Johnny  Football  I  Don't  Know  I  Mean  That  Whole  Scene  Bothers  Me  So  Much  I  Thought  It  Was  Going  To  Be  Interesting  To  See  If  He  Had  The  Capacity  To  Handle  All  That  Was  Being  Thrown  His  Way  With 
[01:56:30]  That  One  Could  He  Be  The  Man  In  The  Face  Of  This  Off  Season  But  Now  I  Just  Think  It's  Ridiculous  He  Signing  His  Name  The  NCAA  I  Don't  Know  If  You  Saw  This  But  Jay  Noelle  Of  Kentucky  Johnny  Football  And  They  Would  Show  Up  With  Their  Jerseys  I  Mean  It's  Just  It's  An  Absolute  Joke  I  There's  Nothing  Else  I  Can  Say  About  It  But  It's  Hard  To  Believe  That  A  Guy  Can't  Sign  His 
[01:57:00]  Name  Yeah  You  Sign  Your  Name  He's  Your  Problem  Yeah  Yeah  You  Can't  Do  It  I  Mean  That's  A  Violation  I  Just  Don't  But  Yet  These  Schools  Can  Those  Number  Two  Jerseys  For  Him  I  Just  And  People  And  It's  Funny  To  Listen  To  Some  Of  The  Media  Members  I  Don't  Know  If  You  Heard  About  This  Division  Four  With  The  Four  Major  Conferences

[02:01:30]  Off  Label  Is  The  Brand  New  Documentary  Comes out  New York  And  Los Angeles  Friday  August  9th  At  The  Same  Time  It's  Available  On  Demand  Go  Over  To  Off  Label  Film  Dot  Com  Welcome  Guys  How  Are  You  Good  Thanks  For  Having  Us  What  Put  This  Film 
[02:02:00]  Together  What  First  Sparked  The  Idea  To  Do  Something  About  This  We  Were  Approached  Actually  By  Two  Producers  Producers  Of  This  Film  After  They  Saw  Our  First  Film  October  Country  And  They  Were  Interested  In  Making  A  Film  About  Human  Guinea  Pigs  And  They  Shared  With  Us  A  Few  Articles  One  Of  Them  Being  Carl  Elliott's  Guinea  Pigging  That  Was  A  Really  Great  Article  In  The  New  Yorker  And  So  We  Took  A  Look  At  That  Article  And  Really  Thought  Well  Maybe  This  Could  Be  Something  Interesting  To 
[02:02:30]  Make  And  So  We  Did  Some  Exploring  With  The  Idea  And  That  Was  The  Starting  Point  So  There  Are  People  Out  There  Who  Are  Just  Willing  To  Be  Human  Guitty  Pigs  For  The  Drug  Companies  And  They  Don't  Know  Exactly  What  They're  Taking  They  Do  Know  What  They're  Taking  Usually  The  Problem  Is  More  With  The  Transparency  Of  Risk  And  Dosage  And  Combinations  Of  Drugs  And  That's  It's  Trickier  Trickier 
[02:03:00]  Area  Once  You're  Actually  In  The  Studies  But  Some  Of  These  People  Treat  Like  A  Career  Well  Yeah  Because  It's  It's  A  Money  Opportunity  Yeah  You know  So  I mean  At least  In our  Exploration  Of it  It  Seems  To  Be  More  Like  Something  Where  You know  There's  People  On  The  Margins  Who  You know  They  Don't  Have  Many  Options  Right  One  Of  Those  Options  Is  To  You know  Do  Drug  Testing  But  The  Film  Is  Larger  Than  That  And  It  Just  Becomes  About  The  Drug  Culture  That  We  Have  In 
[02:03:30]  This  Country  And  We  Used  To  Discuss  Drug  Culture  Like  It  Was  You  Know  Jazz  Musicians  Smoking  Pot  And  Doing  Heroin  And  Then  Became  Rock  Musicians  But  Now  The  Drug  Culture  Is  Almost  Everyone  Across  The  Board  You  Have  Addicts  That  Could  Be  Your  Parents  Or  Grandparents  In  This  Country  Now  It's  Definitely  All  Pervasive  For  Sure  I  Mean  That  Is  Our  Culture  Right  Now  You know  And  It's  Been  Slowly  Developing  Over  Many 
[02:04:00]  Years  But  Yeah  Where  Do  You  Think  The  Changes  Start  To  Take  Place  In  That  Direct  To  Consumer  Marketing  For  Sure  I  Mean  In  Some  Ways  You  Know  The  One  Of  The  Greatest  You  Know  Marketing  Campaigns  Ever  Has  Been  Sort  Of  What's  Been  Waged  By  Pharmaceutical  Companies  On  The  American  Public  In  General  To  To  Try  Or  Take  Certain  Drugs  For  Various  Things  That  Are  Real  As  Well  As  I  Think  You  Know  Somewhat  Imagined  Yeah  The  I 
[02:04:30]  Remember  A  Couple  Years  Ago  When  They  Were  Pitching  The  Shaky  Leg  Syndrome  Where  It  Was  A  Big  Thing  That  If  You're  The  Type  Of  Person  Who  Sits  There  And  Has  A  Little  Extra  Energy  This  You  Know  It's  Not  Life  Threatening  And  Yet  Go  Directly  To  Your  Doctor  And  Tell  You  I  Believe  We're  One  Of  Only  Two  Countries  Where  You're  Allowed  To  Pitch  Directly  To  People  You  Can't  Do  This  In  Europe  They  Have  To  You  Know  The  Drug  Companies  There  Go  And  Talk  To  The  Doctors  And  Say  There's  New  Stuff  Up  But  In  This  Country  They 
[02:05:00]  Want  Us  To  Go  In  And  Ask  Our  Doctor  For  These  Drugs  Yeah  And  The  Ask  Your  Doctor  Campaign  Definitely  Is  What  Shifted  A  Lot  Of  The  Patterns  Of  Usage  In  Our  Culture  For  Sure  That  People  Going  In  And  Asking  Their  Doctor  As  Well  As  The  Marketing  Also  Happens  In  The  Zone  Of  Where  Doctors  Are  Also  Operating  So  You've  Got  A  Multi-Tiered  Campaign  That's  Occurring  And  It  Slowly  Becomes  Normal  Well  Half  If  You 
[02:05:30]  Go  To  The  Doctor  About  Half  The  People  In  The  Waiting  Room  Are  Drug  Reps  Normally  They  I  Have  Friends  That  Are  Drug  Reps  In  New  York  It  Changed  Quite  A  Bit  Because  They've  Stopped  From  What  They  Can  Give  Out  But  It  Used  To  Be  They  Had  Yankee  Tickets  They  Had  Broadway  Tickets  All  The  Hard  To  Get  Tickets  They've  Stopped  That  But  Still  Every  Doctor's  Office  In  New  York  I  Can't  Speak  For  The  The  Country  Is  Catered 
[02:06:00]  And  Feed  Everybody  So  That  They  Can  Get  Those  Couple  Minutes  To  To  Pitch  You  Had  A  Couple  Drug  Reps  In  This  Film  As  Well  Did  You  Know  Much  About  This  Culture  Before  You  Guys  Did  This  We  Knew  You  Know  Academically  We  Knew  How  It  Worked  From  Reading  Carl  Elliott  And  Writers  Like  Shannon  Brownlee  But  When  We  Met  Michael  Muldani  Who  Is  The  Drug  Rep  In  The  Film 
[02:06:30]  Used  Car  Salesman  Right  Somebody  Peddling  Hells  Sales  Is  Sales  And  This  Is  A  As  Michael  Says  In  The  Film  Sometimes  Sales  Are  Shady  Yeah  Well  It's  A  Money  Making  Operation  Like  Every  Other  Corporation  They  Have  To  Show  A  Profit  Every  Three  To  Four  Months  Again  I'll  Use  New  York  As  An  Example  Hospitals  Are  Buying  Up  The  City  And  I  Know  This  Happens  In  Smaller 
[02:07:00]  Towns  As  Well  Where  The  Hospitals  Are  The  Number  One  Business  In  Every  In  These  Are  There's  Tons  Of  Money  Being  Spent  I  Mean  We  Hear  That  We  Don't  Have  Enough  Money  For  Health  Care  But  How  Are  These  Buildings  Getting  Built  Where  Is  That  Money  Coming  From  It's  Amazing  Yeah  Well  I  Mean  It's  Part  Of  The  Reason  Why  We  Filmed  In  Rochester  Minnesota  Home  Of  The  Mayo  Clinic  So  You've  Got 
[02:07:30]  You  Know  An  Entire  You  Know  Place  That's  You  Know  Essentially  A  Large  Hospital  On  Some  Level  It's  It's  An  Industry  Town  This  Is  An  Industry  Town  The  Way  That  Pittsburgh  Used  To  Be  A  Steel  Town  Detroit  Used  That  That  That  That  We  Found  Out  In  This  Country  That  Insurance  And  Health  Care  Are  Things  That  Most  Of  Us  Are  Involved  In  I  Know  Tons  Of  People  Most  Of  Them  Attractive  Women  Who 
[02:08:00]  Are  Drug  Reps  Whose  Job  Is  To  Go  Into  The  Place  And  Grab  The  Attention  And  I  Notice  That  In  The  Film  When  You  Met  Some  Drug  Rep  On  The  Street  They  Were  Already  Trained  To  Say  No  I  I  Don't  Want  To  Be  In  Your  Yeah  We  Were  In  The  Film  We  Just  By  Chance  You  Know  Ran  Into  A  Drug  Rep  Like  They  Are  Sitting  In  The  Waiting  Room  And  You  Know  We  Were  Filming  Michael  Who  Was  An  Ex  Drug  Rep  On  His  Way  Out  And  So  That 
[02:08:30]  Just  Happened  By  Chance  And  But  In  All  Fairness  We  Didn't  Feel  Like  That  Person  Also  Has  A  Job  Right  And  They  Need  To  Make  A  Living  And  Stuff  Like  That  So  You  Know  The  Reason  We  Blanked  Them  Out  Or  One  They  Wouldn't  Want  To  Talk  To  Us  But  Two  You  Want  To  Protect  Their  Identities  Because  These  People  Are  Trying  To  Earn  A  Living  As  Well  You  Have  To  Be  Respectful  Of  That  Issue  When  You're  Making  A 
[02:09:00]  That  We  Have  In  This  Country  Is  Not  Everyone  Who  Needs  Zoloft  A  Lot  Of  People  Who  Don't  Need  Zoloft  Are  On  It  A  Lot  Of  People  Who  Don't  Need  To  Be  On  Adderall  Are  On  A  Lot  Of  People  Who  Don't  Need  To  Be  On  Oxycontin  Are  On  It  I  Honestly  Believe  That  The  People  Who  Need  To  Be  On  It  Need  To  Be  On  It  I  Don't  I  Don't  Have  A  Problem  With  That  At  All  I  Couldn't  Agree  With  You  More  There 
[02:09:30]  There's  A  Woman  In  This  Film  Polly  Yar  Who  It's  Very  Clear  To  Me  That  She  Is  Mentally  Ill  I  Mean  That  At  Least  To  Me  I  Mean  I  Mean  I  Mean  Not  A  Doctor  But  It's  Pretty  Clear  To  Me  That  Her  Conditions  Are  Extreme  Enough  That  This  Medication  Is  Obviously  Something  That  She  Needs  But  In  Her  Instance  I  Believe  What's  Going  On  Is  She's  Seeing  Multiple  Doctors  And  Multiple  Prescriptions  Are  Being  Written  And  It's  Really  To  Nobody's  Specific  Fault  Doctors 
[02:10:00]  Aren't  Necessarily  Doing  Something  Wrong  Because  They  Don't  Know  That  There's  Another  Doctor  In  The  Picture  Managing  Her  Own  Prescriptions  And  Thinks  That  For  Herself  These  Things  Feel  Right  And  I  Would  Imagine  A  Licensed  Psychotherapist  Might  Say  Titrate  This  Person  Off  Of  These  Ten  Medications  And  Give  Them  This  One  Medication  So  I  Would  Say  That  She  Would  Benefit  From  Medications  And  She  Certainly  Feels  That  She  Is  In  A  Better  Place  Than  She 
[02:10:30]  Was  On  The  Medications  But  It's  Still  Possible  That  Where  Another  Problem  That  We  Have  Is  That  A  Lot  Of  These  Doctors  Can't  See  The  People  Long  Enough  Fez  Who  You  Met  Coming  In  Here  We've  Been  Trying  To  Get  He's  Got  Anxiety  And  Depression  Problems  He's  Almost  The  Worst  Person  To  Talk  About  What  The  Drug  Is  Doing  To  Him  Because  So  Many  Times  They  Confuse  Him  So  Sometimes  He'll  Be 
[02:11:00]  Out  Of  It  For  Months  At  A  Time  These  Things  Of  Trying  To  Figure  Out  When  You  Start  To  Fuck  With  People's  Brain  Chemistry  It's  A  Very  Difficult  Thing  To  Get  Back  To  What  Is  Normal  To  Me  How  Do  I  Feel  Normal  There's  Some  Elderly  People  In  My  Family  That  I  Know  That  They're  Keeping 
[02:11:30]  Too  Whacked  Out  And  There's  No  Top  Because  They  Have  Good  Insurance  They  They  Just  Do  What  Their  Doctors  Tell  Them  But  I've  Watched  Them  Slide  Off  Into  This  Quiet  Different  Life  They're  Not  The  People  I  Knew  When  They  Were  Younger  And  How  Do  You  Qualify  Even  Normal  You  Know  There's  A  Degree  Of  Depression  Right  And  Pain  And  Anxiety  That  Actually  I  Think  Are  Quite  Normal  To  Life  And  You  Shouldn't  Remove  Those  Qualities 
[02:12:00]  A  Friend  Of  Mine  Was  Put  On  I  Guess  It  Was  Zoloft  After  His  Dad  Died  He  Said  I  Been  Very  Depressed  I  Go  Your  Dad  Died  If  There's  Not  A  Time  In  Your  Life  That  You  Should  Feel  Bad  And  Down  It  Should  Be  When  You  Have  A  Major  Death  Like  That  But  For  Some  Reason  We  Feel  Like  Something  Bad  Is  In  Our  Life  This  Should  Not  Exist  Rather  Than  Deal  With  It  Or  See  It  As  Some  Of  The  Flavor  Of  What  It  Takes 
[02:12:30]  There  Was  A  New  I  Couldn't  Remember  What  It  Was  Called  But  It  Was  Essentially  For  Grief  Like  In  These  Situations  Like  Somebody's  A  Family  Member  Dies  And  If  You  Are  Grieving  For  More  Than  A  Period  Of  Say  Two  Weeks  Then  It  Satisfies  The  Conditions  You  Know  In  The  Current  Medical  Practices  To  Consider  Depression  Medication  Which  I  Mean  My  Reaction  That  Is  Well  That's  Kind  Of  Crazy  You're  Grieving  Right  But 
[02:13:00]  At  The  Same  Time  Like  You  Know  If  The  Grief  Goes  On  For  A  Long  Time  Or  Something  You  Know  I  Mean  I  Been  In  A  Situation  Once  Where  You  Know  Well  I  Took  Well  Butrin  It  Was  For  A  Three  Month  Period  I  Never  Taken  Anything  It  Was  Actually  Towards  The  End  Of  Editing  Our  First  Film  It  Was  Actually  The  Very  End  Of  That  It  It  Worked  It  Worked  Very  Well  But  I  Stepped  Away  From  It  Within  Three  Months  Because  It  Felt  Like  It  Was  It  Had  Done  Something  Like  It  Kick  Started  Something  And  Then  It  Was  Like 
[02:13:30]  Okay  That's  Enough  You  Know  So  You  Know  These  Things  It's  The  Practice  Of  Medicine  You  Know  It  And  They  Also  Don't  It  It's  Tough  To  Say  Who  Is  The  Addictive  Personality  And  Who  Is  It  Maybe  You  Are  The  Type  Of  Person  Who  Go  I  Can  Get  To  This  Point  And  Pull  Myself  Off  Of  It  In  The  Same  Way  That  I  Know  People  Who  Can  Only  Smoke  A  Cigarette  When  They  Drink  They  Don't  Other  People  Once  They  Had  That  For  Cigarette  They  Were  In  There  Smokers  From  That  Point  On  So 
[02:14:00]  There  Can't  Be  A  Book  Of  Here's  The  Way  That  Human  Beings  React  We  Just  We  Are  Not  Like  That  There's  All  Different  Kinds  But  Certainly  You  Can  Look  At  This  Country  And  Think  There's  No  Way  70%  Of  People  Need  To  Be  On  Drugs  70%  Of  The  People  Are  Finding  It  That  Life  Itself  Is  Too  Difficult  To  Deal  With  Here's  What  Kills  Me  To  That  Fucking  Oxycontin  And  So  Many  Other  Morphines 
[02:14:30]  Belong  In  All  Around  The  That  They  Get  Burned  And  They  Don't  Have  Any  Medicine  To  Take  Where  We  Feel  Bad  That  We  Didn't  Get  The  Job  We  Want  So  We  Stay  Knotted  Out  For  Two  Years  I  Mean  These  Drugs  Do  Belong  All  At  A  Lot  Of  Places  But  I  Guess  They  Just  Don't  Have  The  Money  To  Pay  For  I  Could  Tell  You  One  Thing  I  Just  Had  A  Surgery  For  It  Snapped  My Achilles  Tendon  A  Couple  Months  Ago  And  I  Went 
[02:15:00]  For  Surgery  And  I  Be  Damned  If  They  Didn't  Give  Me  Oxy  Cotton  For  That  After  The  Surgery  And  If  I  Didn't  Have  That  It  Would  Have  Been  Extremely  Painful  So  There  Instances  Of  Course  Where  This  Is  Sort  Of  What  We're  Looking  At  It  Like  There's  An  Intersection  Where  Medicine  Is  Really  Necessary  In  Our  Lives  But  When  Medicine  Becomes  Capitalized  In  Such  A  Way  That  Expands  The  Horizons  Of  How  You  Would  Give  Drugs  To  People  How  Long  Did  You  Stay  On  The  Oxy  Cotton  Oh  It  Was  Only  Less 
[02:15:30]  Than  A  Week  Right  I  Actually  Think  There  Was  Two  Days  Or  Something  And  Then  They  Step  You  Down  To  Percocet  For  A  Few  Days  And  They  Give  You  Quite  A  Liberal  Prescription  For  It  It  Something  You  Know  I  Didn't  Finish  The  Bottle  Because  You  Can  Feel  That  Stuff  Is  Heavy  For  Me  It  Is  Just  It  It's  Heavy  Stuff  Like  After  A  Week  You  Are  Okay  Enough  Enough  Staring  At  The  Wall  And  Doing  Nothing  And  Feeling  Good  About  It  You  See  I'm  The  Exact  Opposite  Because  I've  Never  They  Tell  You  Take  It  Until  You  Throw  It  Away  No  I'm  Not 
[02:16:00]  Fucking  Throw  Away  Right  Down  To  The  Point  Where  The  Last  Time  I  Had  An  Operation  I  Didn't  Take  Any  I  Wouldn't  Take  Any  Medication  Because  I  Knew  What  It  Was  Going  To  Do  To  Me  Long  Run  Yeah  There's  Like  A  Body  Memory  Thing  That  Happens  With  It  I  Mean  It's  I  Definitely  Felt  That  From  You  Know  Just  Say  Six  Days  When 
[02:16:30]  You  Step  Away  From  It  You  You  Know  I  Just  Said  Okay  No  More  And  You  Know  That's  Not  Really  The  Way  To  Do  It  Right  Yeah  But  You  Feel  Nauseous  The  Next  Day  You  Really  Are  Withdrawing  The  Next  Time  You  Try  And  Take  That  Yeah  Your  Body  Remembers  You  Know  This  Kind  Of  Negative  Reaction  That  You  Have  There  Is  No  Sickness  Like  Dope  Sickness  You  You  Are  Crawling  Out  Of  Your  Skin  To  Get  Back  To  That 
[02:17:00]  Paul  Yeah  And  The  And  Years  And  What  Happened  To  Her  Was  Who's  Handing  All  These  Out  To  Her  I  Mean  How  Do  We  Get  To  That  Point  Where  We're  Watching  Someone  You  Know  Ticking  Down  Like  You  Said  She  Definitely  Needs  Some  Kind  Of  Help  There's  No  Doubt  That  Whatever  Even  If  It's  Just  Obsessive  Compulsive  Thing  But  How  Can  She  Get  Her  Hand  On  That  Many  Pills  It's 
[02:17:30]  Really  Not  Hard  I  Mean  You  Can  Before  My  Grandparents  Died  They  Had  You  Know  Ten  Pills  A  Day  You  Know  For  Various  Elements  Or  For  The  Side  Effects  And  That's  From  A  Single  Physician  And  You  Know  In  A  Culture  Which  Is  Sort  Of  Perpetuating  You  Know  People  Sort  Of  Want  Illness  You  Know  They  See  It  On  TV  You  Know  And  So  It's  Not  Very  Hard  And  Conveniently  At 
[02:18:00]  Odds  And  End  So  That  A  Person  Can  Have  Two  Physicians  Who  Aren't  Communicating  Sure  So  If  You  Can't  Get  If  One  Doctor  Refuses  Because  They're  Sort  Of  You  Know  Sense  That  You  Don't  Really  Need  This  Medicine  It's  Not  Hard  To  Go  To  Another  Doctor  And  Get  That  Medicine  So  A  Single  Individual  Can  Have  A  Few  Physicians  You  Know  And  Then  There's  Other  Channels  Which  Numbers  Like  Doing 
[02:18:30]  20  Medications  Or  Whatever  I  Mean  You  Can  Really  You  Know  Jack  Someone  Up  Pretty  Good  With  Just  Two  You  Know  Right  I  Mean  Andy  Duffy  Who  Is  The  Vet  Who  Came  Back  And  You  Know  He  Goes  Into  The  VA  And  The  VA  Is  They're  Simply  Understaffed  You  Know  They  Don't  Have  The  Financial  Sort  Of  Backing  To  Provide  People  With  Say  The  Talk  Therapy  That  They  Want  Which  Is  Really  What  A  Lot  Of  Them  Want  Right  But  What  They  Can  Do  What  They're  Equipped  To  Do  Is  To  Dispense  Medication  So  You 
[02:19:00]  Know  Andy  I  Think  Was  On  He  Was  On  Klonopin  And  Zoloft  Or  You  Know  A  Combination  Of  Two  Different  Kinds  Of  Drugs  But  You  Know  We  Saw  Him  You  Know  In  A  Period  Where  He  Was  Deeply  In  That  And  We  Saw  Him  Outside  Of  It  And  It  Was  Only  By  His  Own  Sort  Of  Agency  That  He  Pulled  Himself  Out  Of  That  Situation  We  Watched  Him  Get  Better  You  Know  Those  Drugs  Didn't  Work  For  Him  In  Some  Cases  They  Might  Work  For  Other  People  Because  These  People  They  Have  Extreme  Stress  You  Know  So  You  Know  In  Some  Of  The  Cases  I 
[02:19:30]  Think  It  Is  Alleviating  The  Problems  But  Down  The  Road  The  Talk  Therapy  With  Me  And  You  Would  Never  Work  Because  We  Have  No  Idea  What  He  Saw  What  It  Felt  Like  To  Be  Back  Here  It's  Only  The  Fact  That  Those  Guys  Get  Together  And  Basically  Take  Some  Time  To  What 
[02:20:00]  The  Fuck  Was  That  What  Are  We  Doing  Back  Here  You  Know  Because  A lot  Of  Come  Back  Here  And  See  Us  Who  Are  So  Naive  Or  Ignorant  To  The  Places  That  We  Saw  Them  And  We  Turn  Them  Off  You  Know  We  Got  To  Keep  Those  Guys  Together  But  Again  What  Drug  Could  Possibly  Make  You  Forget  Or  Be  Okay  With  The  Things  That  This  Kid  Saw  Exactly  And  I  Mean  I  Think  It  Speaks  To  The  Problem  If  You  Are  Just  Negating  Trauma

[02:22:30]  Bye  Bye  Bye  Bye  Bye 
[02:23:00]  Thank you. 
[02:23:30]  Thank you. 
[02:24:00]  Thank you. 
[02:24:30]  I mean, I'll put the cameras following me around. I'm going to get anyone arrested, though.  You would be the one to arrest it. The thing would end with you being arrested and the judge literally throwing away the key.  I'd be so fucked up. They wouldn't even let me out between, like, the sentencing.  But when you talk to a guy like him who said, they gave me Oxycontin and I couldn't wait to get off it. I cannot relate to that. 
[02:25:00]  I was like, we're different people.  Some people are just not addictive.  Yeah. I got my wisdom teeth out. They gave me some Vicodins. I was taking double the dosage first straight up the back.  I was like, all right, just what? They recommend dojo ain't gonna do shit. And then, you know, two days later, I'm like, yeah, I need this fucking another refill.  You told me I could call, right? I need more because I'm still in pain. And any time I've ever been given fucking legit painkillers from a doctor when I have a script for it. 
[02:25:30]  Have you ever been turned down, like, when you go back to do the straight, like, second or third time?  Yeah, like, you put me...  It's very embarrassing.  You can't do this. Like, come on. I need him. I'm in pain, you asshole. I need this.  Bad. Not a proud moment. You know, I'm just trying to find it over.  Well, you know what's really funny is dentists... I don't know whether you know this or not,  but dentists always know who the alcoholics and addicts are because those people need more gas and more Novocaine. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, shit.  So, when you are a drunk or an addict, you feel the pain of a root canal more than a person who's not.  That's so fucking weird. I guess because you're numb more often, so when...  I couldn't tell you the reasons. Maybe there's somebody out there who understands the medical reasons, 
[02:26:30]  but I've heard this time and time again, that you will actually feel the pain more than anyone else.  And you'll be like, no, it hurts. Can I have more Novocaine?  Yeah.  And then you'll say, can I have more pills?  Well, that's why... When I had to go get cavities full two months ago or whatever,  I was having to just fucking pump my face full of this shit.  And I was like, I still feel it. I still feel it. Please, more. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, that's the other thing about you, too. You also take fistful of aspirins and...  You know what I mean? Like, you know when it's like that.  But when I was really at my worst, right? So I had gone through this windshield and fucked up my head.  Jesus.  I tore the skin off. You kind of almost scalp yourself when you go through a windshield, your forehead.  So what they had to do was run a lathe across my forehead to get rid of all the skin so that I would grow in new baby skin. 
[02:27:30]  Okay. Fresh, fresh shit.  Like, if you feel the skin on my forehead right now, it's like the skin of a 14-year-old girl.  I mean, the skin on my forehead is nicer than Molly's skin.  Because I reboot it. I reboot it, right?  Yeah.  So they give me the morphine drip, and they're like, this is going to knock you out.  And they start to lay it. While I'm fucking sitting there talking, I'm like, I'm going to need a little more. 
[02:28:00]  You know, you've got to amp it up a little bit.  Like, never did, you know, go away on it.  But I really could feel the pain of the lathe.  Like, I'm not making that up even now.  Like, I still could feel the sting, and I was like, I'd like a little more.  And then finally, the girl who was in charge of the drip, she, like, yells at me, but she's almost crying.  She goes like this,  Anymore will kill you!  She just, like, there wasn't, like, she didn't even have, like, a beef for one second before that.  You know? 
[02:28:30]  And then she yells that out.  That passive lady.  Yeah.  Which was kind of a weird fucking thing to see her do.  But then, like, here's the other thing that you know, like, when you're, like, addictive.  So, they wanted me to, you know, lay down after I had it done until the morphine.  All you want to do is fucking sit up and stay, you know what I mean?  You battle the nods back as to not waste it with a nice long sleep. 
[02:29:00]  God, it's so stupid.  Here's our buddy Andy in Cleveland.  I was, I'm so stoked to see this, because I was totally blown away.  Last year, I got health insurance for the first time in, like, seven years.  And it turns out it's not good to wait seven years in between doctor's visits. 
[02:29:30]  But they put me, everything they put me on carried the same warning label, like you said, Ron.  It turns your liver into a punching bag.  And so, you know, on top of having to take this medication, now they're telling you, oh, yeah, by the way, you can't drink ever again.  Right.  And it's kind of like, what, what, whoa.  So, you know, first of all, my doctor is crazy about statins.  And, you know, I beg everybody out there to do the research, because they're not for everybody, and the physicians think they're God's cure to everything. 
[02:30:00]  And then on top of it, you know, I'm not even 40.  And every week, I'm taking a six-pill dose of methotrexate for arthritis, which is a chemical therapy drug for children that they discovered.  Oh, by the way, it also helps inflammation.  And on top of that, I have to take folic acid. 
[02:30:30]  I take more folic acid than a pregnant woman, because the methotrexate leaches that out of my system.  So, you know, what I would love to, I'm hoping they address this in this film, but one of the biggest problems we have in the country is we don't work towards a cure anymore.  All these companies aren't researching cures, they're just researching better treatments.  You're exactly right. 
[02:31:00]  And you honestly couldn't do enough films on this?  You really couldn't, because there's so many different things.  But you are right, there is no money in a cure.  It's just like when people go, oh, we've, you know, we've cured AIDS.  It's, no, we've taken the HIV process and really slowed it down until it's a lifetime thing that you deal with.  You know, we're not really, no, sorry, Ron, that was a really dark thing, is that even when the treatments get too good, 
[02:31:30]  like if they get a treatment that really works, they screw with it so it can only be affordable by the upper echelon to make the most money out of it.  The big point, the big case was some of these anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis, like rheumatoid and psoriatic that I have, like Enbrel.  You hear about it a lot on the golf shows, because the guy, the one guy, I think Nicholson is a spokesperson. 
[02:32:00]  And they came out with that drug.  It worked amazingly well.  And for the people who first started taking it, it cost them $60 a month when it was first rolled out.  And when they found out how well it was working, they actually screwed with the FDA in front of a loophole in their stuff.  It said they didn't have to farm out a generic, which meant they could raise the price to whatever they wanted.  And when the FDA said, hey, you can't do that, they said, oh, yeah, by the way, we also make these cancer drugs for kids.  If you're not going to let us do that, we can't guarantee further production of these cancer drugs for children. 
[02:32:30]  And I don't think you want that on your conscience.  So you're going to let us do this.  So now those drugs that cost people $60 a month, just you can move and exist, now cost them $2,000 and up a month.  And no insurance pays for those drugs.  That's the craziest thing of all.  It's like, how are you ever supposed to pay this thing out, you know? 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, it's fucking nuts.  I did health insurance for like a heartbeat right before I started really being a part of this.  And it was so, I learned way too much and got the hell out.  It was just, it was fucking crazy.  All right, thanks, buddy.  Talk to you later, bye.  Normally, he's all happy talking about some kind of superhero thing.  I had no idea. 
[02:33:30]  Damn, Andy.  He's like a comic book guy.  He's Dr. Glass.  You know, I was just, I'm reading this other book.  Have you ever heard of Rhino Records?  Oh, yeah, hell yeah.  Well, the guy who started that has a book out.  And it's amazing how much a record store is like a comic book store.  Well, with your hardcores and...  Yeah, your hardcores and a lot of people just hanging out there to talk about stuff.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:34:00]  You know, Rhino Records started as a record store first before they started producing their own stuff.  Basically high fidelity, right?  High fidelity.  Have you ever read the book?  I never read the book.  I've only seen the film.  I think that he's a terrific writer.  And, you know, to be a really good writer, you don't have to write about really big topics.  But just be kind of realistic about the way things are.  Like subcultures that you never even gave a lot of thought to. 
[02:34:30]  So, it's really good.  It's really fucking strong.  And that's the weird thing that kids don't have that kind of neighborhood record store.  And I'm not talking about a fucking Tower Records.  I'm talking about the weird guy who sold pipes and albums.  You know what I mean?  With a little sign that said, these pipes are for tobacco ever.  Really?  Because I've never known anyone to smoke tobacco out of a bong.  That's tobacco pipe.  But don't you say it any different. 
[02:35:00]  Listen, people are listening on this.  I bet, or wonder if, Shelby and Molly have ever been in a true record store.  I'll say Molly, definitely not.  Shelby, there's an outside chance.  Being that he grew up in Portland.  I think Portland, I think like New York, we'll still have a couple.  Even though in New York, there's not a lot of record shops.  See, I think that Molly might have went with her dad, though.  Oh, shit.  Because there's always...  An independent thing would always have a good jazz section.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  Yeah.  And she does know a little bit about jazz.  She's going to plenty of shows with her dad.  Shelby knows a little bit about jazz.  More than a little.  Oh, God.  Matt, you're on the Runa Fez show.  Hi.  Yeah, I've actually dealt with this exact same thing, and you're absolutely right.  It's a medical condition called hyperalgesia.  When I was 19, I was in a really bad car accident. 
[02:36:00]  And over the last 13 years, doctor prescribed me upwards of 1,000 milligrams of oxygen a day.  And last year, I went into rehab because I was abusing them, obviously.  And that's where I got educated on it and found out that it actually makes you more sensitive to pain.  And I'm actually clean now off of them.  And I have less pain than I've had since the accident.  You know who feels more pain than anyone I've ever met in my life?  Who?  Eastside Dave. 
[02:36:30]  Oh, shit.  Dave cannot handle pain at all.  Well, is that a redhead thing?  But how could that be?  How could redheads feel more pain than anyone else?  But in his case, it seems to be true.  Yeah.  Even tattoos still really hurt him.  And I remember when there was a spanking thing, and he was screaming.  And we were like, after the fact, we were like, great bet.  And he's like, dude, I'm serious.  He was clubbing.  Like, no, you're getting hit on the ass. 
[02:37:00]  It's no big deal.  You're fine.  He would just scream.  The branding, when he got branded.  On his ass.  Oh, but one man good.  Yeah, he was losing his shit.  Another stupid thing with restaurants and Facebook.  A cafe owner called out a mom for crumbs on Facebook.  And, of course, everybody's mad at the cafe.  They brought a couple little kids with them eating cookies.  And the stuff went on the floor. 
[02:37:30]  And then these people think, I'm going to shame them.  Well, they public shaming.  I got them.  This will teach them.  Those kids will never leave a crumb ever again.  There is an anti-kid thing that exists in the world.  Oh, yeah.  There's plenty of people who hate kids.  Even people that have kids still doesn't mean that they don't hate other people's kids.  I'm very uncomfortable around children.  So, I just don't like being around them.  But I don't think I hate them.  Yeah, but you get a certain... 
[02:38:00]  You'd rather not have a kid here.  Yeah.  Even Dave's kid.  I felt...  Yeah, I felt...  Just children.  Just being around them.  Being in the same room with them.  Makes me feel uncomfortable.  But you said you didn't like a kid when you were a kid.  Yeah, I...  You'd rather be around adults.  Yeah, it was very strange.  Yeah, I remember thinking like, ah, these fucking kids are assholes.  I'd rather be around with the adults.  It was very weird.  They're talking about dumb stuff and...  Like, I don't care about that shit.  Fuck it. 
[02:38:30]  I don't know what has happened with the social media now that they feel the need to more or  less slut shame everyone.  I'm going to put a picture of them up and show what a disgusting person they are.  And then it'll blow up and go, fuck it.  It'll fucking show up everywhere.  And then I'll...  I got them.  You work in a fucking restaurant.  Crumbs are going to end up on the floor.  No.  It's now your job to clean that up.  It's fucking crazy. 
[02:39:00]  The person who runs this restaurant is an insane person.  I don't even know if...  See, the weird thing is like, you could take our interns, and I bet that they're as dense  about their childhood as we are about our...  You know, it's almost like once you get out of those little kid years, you never want  to go back to them.  I don't.  That's for damn sure.  Like, we shamed Molly today by playing our stupid songs.  Dinosaur song.  Lone Dinosaur. 
[02:39:30]  Crazy stuff.  All right, it is the Ron and Fez show.  Another story on the iBang that's crazy is Mexican cartels are recruiting U.S. soldiers as hitmen.  Oh, God.  And this is one of your favorite rich kids of Instagram now coming to TV.  Yeah, the rich kids of Instagram, E!  Entertainment Television, is us creating a show. 
[02:40:00]  Rich kids of Beverly Hills.  It's rich kids of Instagram on TV.  They're grabbing...  It's being developed.  So I don't know when it's coming out, but I'm sure it'll hit the airwaves.  By the way, did you see how few crumbs were on the floor of that place?  Yeah, these people are totally insane.  We leave a bigger mess when we go out places.  I wonder if the cleaning ladies here have fucking Twitter accounts.  I wish that it was still acceptable to put a bib, like, put that thing down your shirt, like, in the old days. 
[02:40:30]  I guess they were worried because you didn't clean your shirt every day in those days, so you would just take the tablecloth.  But there's not a person on our show that wouldn't be better off sticking the tablecloth down their shirt like that.  I definitely have stains all over this shirt.  That's not to do.  I guess we'll break then.  We'll be back in a couple of minutes.  Chris, I know you've got a box you want to do, right?  The Lovable Losers? 
[02:41:00]  Lovable Losers, yeah.  Even the Losers!  Gonna bring it.  Get lucky sometimes!  We'll also make the Unmasked announcement.  This is gonna be a very strange Unmasked.  I may go so far to say,  this may be our first spiritual Unmasked.  Wow.  This is exciting.  This is the first Unmasked, I think, when we're, like, pointing at higher self. 
[02:41:30]  This is probably the first Unmasked that Deepak would like.  All right, I'll let him know.  Or Depak.  Deepak.  My Tupac.  That wasn't Tupac?  No, that was Tupac.  I've always called him Tupac.  Oh, God.  No, Tupac Shakur.  Ernie, in Florida, you're on the Runa Fez show.  Hey, a million bucks, Ronnie P.  But, uh, also, uh, you're talking about people who, uh, have kids who hate kids. 
[02:42:00]  Um, mine are old, um, they're older.  Uh, one's in college, the other two are getting out this year.  And I go into a restaurant, and there's little kids just freaking doing whatever they do and  making noise or being on a jet.  I just want to strangle them all.  Well, you don't even have to strangle them.  All you gotta do is frighten them.  Let them know that they could get strangled.  And you're an adult.  Yeah, but then, yeah, but then especially on a jet, they have a tendency to, you know, 
[02:42:30]  have friends waiting for you at the terminal when you land.  Yeah, um, there are some people out there that cannot handle their children.  Yet I wouldn't think of slut-shaming them by putting them on,  look at these awful kids.  Get a vine, get a vine of it.  Find those, those underage people, and then just pass them on the internet.  All right, we'll be back with the announcement.  Uh, there's a great iBang viral up, if you go in the viral section. 
[02:43:00]  The iBang viral section.  Uh, and that is a, uh, the notebook rain gimmick.  Where the kid is actually using rain to pick up chicks.  It's pretty cute.  Uh, we'll be right back.  With the losers and an unmasked announcement.  It's the Ron and Fez show.  You're enjoying the Ron and Fez show.  On Sirius XM's O.P. and Anthony channel. 
[02:43:30]  More in moments.  Don't you know me, Kansas City?  I'm the new Berlin Wall.  Try and tear me down.  I was born on the other side.  Love a town ripped in tow.  I made it over the grave of light.  I made it over the grave of light.  Now I'm coming for you.  And I'm missing. 
[02:44:00]  I'm a series.  You're trying to tear me down.  You want me, baby, I tell you.  You're trying to tear me down.  I was from my foot the doctor's slab. 
[02:44:30]  Like Lazarus from the pit.  Now everyone wanna take a step.  Don't take a rape, baby.  Blug your feet and spit.  And I'm missing.  Now I say it.  You're trying to tear me down.  You want me, baby, I tell you.  You're trying to tear me down. 
[02:45:00]  On August 13th, 1961, a wall was erected down the middle of the city of Berlin. 
[02:45:30]  The world was divided by a Cold War.  And the Berlin Wall was the most hated symbol of that divide.  Reviled, graffitied, spit upon.  We thought the wall would stand forever.  And now that is gone, we don't know who we are anymore.  Ladies and gentlemen, head big, it's like that wall.  I love this check.  Standing before you in a divide between East and West.  Slavery and freedom.  Man and woman. 
[02:46:00]  Jump and bottom and you can try and tear her down.  But before you do, you must remember one thing.  Hey.  Ain't much of a difference between a bridge and a wall.  Without me right in the middle of the bank.  Without me right in the middle of the bank.  Wow.  There'd be nothing at all.  An amazing adversary.  Try and tear me down. 
[02:46:30]  You want me, baby, I tell you.  Try and tear me down.  An amazing adversary.  Try and tear me down  You want me better, I get it  Try and tear me down  From East Berlin, the junction city  Hello, New York, hello, Missouri 
[02:47:00]  What?  You want to try and tear me down  Oh, come on and tear me down  Hedvig is just like that wool  God, that's a great movie  Now it's coming to Broadway 
[02:47:30]  I'm somewhat nervous about it  Do you know who's doing it?  Is there any, like, known, like  Is it going to be in the cast?  Yeah, Doogie Howser is going to be Hedvig  What?  That's weird  Why is that weird?  You know, this used to be a little off-Broadway play  Yeah  For a long time, and then it was this  Cult movie  And now they're going to, like they did  The John Waters things  Make it a big, happy Broadway play 
[02:48:00]  I am happy that, you know  John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask  Are going to get fucking paid, though  You know?  Oh, this will do ridiculously well  If, I think anything  You know why it's going to do ridiculously well?  It's going to have Doogie Howser in it  Yeah  He's beloved  And it's like that  It's like that sound  People are going to love it  That glam rock sound  Remember when they took Rocky Harder Broadway  It wasn't exactly a hit  I don't know  Because you've got to remember 
[02:48:30]  A lot of old ladies go to those shows  I don't know  I think the best thing they've got going for it right now  Is that those people adore Doogie  And they will show up for him  And I know that he's nervous about doing it  Did Molly ever send us new songs in?  I think she's communicating with her parents  Well, she don't have to worry about it today  If she can't find it  I like instead of talking  You say communicating  Alright, it's time to announce the next Unmasked 
[02:49:00]  This guy is  Oh, there's nobody else like him  That I've ever heard of  We're doing this on August 28th  4.30 right here at the SiriusXM Studios  Here's what he's directed  Ace Ventura  Pet Detective  The Nutty Professor  Liar Liar  Patch Adams  Bruce Almighty 
[02:49:30]  Evan Almighty  His name is Tom Shadiak  Now, here's the interesting thing about Tom  Obviously, he became a multi-millionaire on this  He gave away all of his money  And has moved into a trailer park  In Los Angeles  Oh my God  He puts his money into homeless shelters  And helping people out and stuff like that  He's a young guy, too 
[02:50:00]  I mean, like, he's 40s  Maybe early 50s  You got an age on him?  54  At 54  You could probably use that money for another 30, 35 years  He's got the right  He's set  Those films  No, you're set for the rest of your life  Is there a bigger director of comedy films in the 90s?  Everything you named was gigantic  No  No, these movies are $200 million movies  Yeah, set  These are gigantic 
[02:50:30]  He obviously can always get the comedy out of people who's working with some of the biggest stars  He's Jim Carrey's dude  I mean, Jim Carrey did arguably his best work with this man, Tom Shadiak  I don't know if Eddie Murphy ever made any more, you know, grossed a bigger movie than Nutty Professor  Maybe some of his 80s stuff, but that was definitely his biggest 90s movie  Yeah  Liar Liar was gigantic  Um, Bruce Almighty gigantic 
[02:51:00]  These are $200 million plus movies  Now, it's amazing to not say, you know, at the end of your life, I am giving my money to charity  But to do that in the middle of your life  To say, I don't need all this shit  I'm giving this away to charity  He's done a documentary called I Am  About that  I imagine it's a spiritual thing  I haven't seen it yet  Uh, but I find it fascinating  And he's written a book 
[02:51:30]  And what is the name of the book?  It's a life's operating manual  I really do want people who  Want to be open to talking and looking into why we do that  Things we say  To show up as this audience  I think this is going to be  Um, I certainly can't think  Of a  Of a situation where I'm more interested  In why the person's doing what he's doing  Everyone else that I've ever talked to 
[02:52:00]  We've certainly talked about the craft of comedy  And the career ideas of comedy  I don't know anyone who's given away his fortune  All of it  At age 52 or whatever  This is probably like  To say I'm going to live in a trailer  I think he rides a bike or something  And he claims  He's happier  I can believe that  I know this  I can honestly say 
[02:52:30]  I know that money doesn't make you happy  It doesn't guarantee happiness  But it's certainly better than being broke dick  You know what I mean  Yeah  Like you will not just be happy all the time  Because you have money  Yeah  You'll end up acting like  You know  Oh, Vince Neil or somebody  You know  You're still acting out  You're still acting fucking crazy  But it's just a little bit  I don't know  There's a safety net  It's a little easier  It just seems like  Not worrying about money 
[02:53:00]  Takes some worries away from your head  Yeah  Like can't you keep your money  And then  Fucking be spiritually good  Oprah seems to do it  Yeah  She's walking around  Dragging a billion dollars  Telling everybody that money ain't important  But she's got a shitload of it  She's got most of it  I don't see  Deepak walking in here  Broke dick  Nope  He's hanging out with Oprah  On the website  Meditating  I ain't saying he a gold digger  When I've never seen him 
[02:53:30]  On no broke  Broke  Sounds like they're an item  I am fascinated by this story  Yeah  And I think this is going to be  One of the more interesting  Unmasked that we've ever done  And maybe  We'll sit in there  And I along with the audience  We'll just go like this at him  You're wrong  You fucked up your life  No 
[02:54:00]  What are you doing  You're doing  A wrong thing  That was a fortune you gave away  Oh shit  And he's like  I thought you wanted me  I  I thought  No  I thought you said  That I should  I was just trying  To do what you said  I don't even know you  You gave away  All your fucking money  Dude  Jim Carrey money 
[02:54:30]  You got no money  Jim Carrey's got his money  And he's constantly  Meditating and shit  He seems pretty happy  I don't know if he's happy  I don't know enough about him  I know nothing could have been  Wackier than that  Last video that he did  So that's why I think he's happy  He's like  Just doing  Just weird shit  He's doing whatever he wants  Which one are you talking about  Oh the  Jim Carrey you mean  Jim Carrey  Okay he's happy  I thought you meant Tom  Do you think  Tom Shadyak is happy  I want to see this documentary 
[02:55:00]  From the sound of it  It sounds like  Him doing this  He's doing what he wants  Wouldn't that make you happy  I'm going to ask you this  Alright  Have you ever gotten a  Thing  That has given you  Long term happiness  Because I've gotten things  That have given me  Short term happiness  But even once  I had this  Spectacular fucking house  And only felt like  Really cool about it  For a little while  Until it just felt like  This is where I live 
[02:55:30]  Um  I bought a head scrap  A scalp massager  That gives me a lot of happiness  I've had it for a couple years  And it gives me  And you still  You still like it  Yeah it's a  Dude it's a fucking  Ever use a scalp massager  It's the fucking greatest  It costs five dollars  It's giving me so much  Just physical pleasure  Out of nowhere  I mean that  I mean that's just  Something simple and stupid  Just scratching my own head  Do you ever  Shampoo  Or maybe  Condition  Pledge it twice a week  Cause that could give you  The same thing 
[02:56:00]  That you're looking for  Well ever use one of these things  It'll fucking blow your mind  Oh yeah  Yeah  Didn't we have one  In the old 57th street  I don't remember  You just put it over our heads  Yeah  That's where you fucking got that  No no I swear to God  You stole my fucking scalp massager  No no I don't remember ever seeing it  In 57th street  Hey  Uh  Fez  Back me up here  That was yours  And Chris obviously took it home  What?  That's bullshit 
[02:56:30]  Regardless  Put it in your report Fez  Set it down the hall  I don't need any fucking theft charges  Look  Fuck it  That's  It gives me happiness  It's straight up  If I start fucking scratching my head with it  Who gave that to us?  It was a present  It was  It was a gift  They brought it in  Everybody loved it  Because we also  And you took it home  Got a back thing from it  It was like a cane  That you could stick it  In certain places in your back  Sick  And just kind of massage that one spot 
[02:57:00]  And there was like  Things on it  There was like  Things where you could get  An angle on yourself  And just force this cane  Into your back  Yeah it was great  But yeah  This thing has brought me happiness  Good  Return it  Immediately  It's not yours  I swear to God  Then where's ours?  I don't know  It was a move that happened  I just get lost in the move  I'm uncomfortable that you said ours  Because now it sounds like me and you  Shared a scalp massager 
[02:57:30]  What I'd like to do  Is have him bring it in  And then I want it  Melt down into scrap metal  And then that scrap metal  Thrown in the East River  That will give me happiness  Destroying the thing  That makes me happy?  Tom Shadiac  Here's what he's directed  Ace Ventura  Nutty Professor  Liar Liar  Patch Adams  Bruce Almighty  Evan Almighty  And then he gave all of his money away  This is fucking unbelievable  It's an unbelievable story 
[02:58:00]  You don't think anyone  Working with  Rob Williams  Jim Carrey  Eddie Murphy  I've never heard of anyone  Doing this before  I've heard of people  Who say I raised money  For other people  And I've raised over  You know  A hundred million dollars  But they don't give away  All their shit  It's pretty interesting  He sold all of his homes  Like he like  Just everything gone  And it's like  I don't  I don't need it  I don't know man 
[02:58:30]  I couldn't do it  I don't think that you do need it  You know what I mean  I don't think that you need  I mean let's be honest  Do you really need anything more than a small place?  No  Do you really need a large car  And not a small car?  No  But we want  Is it so wrong to want  This guy's  I don't even know what his religious leadings are  But it's like some sort of Buddhist type thing 
[02:59:00]  Yesterday when I brought this up  To Rob Cross  And he said  Is he a Buddha?  He kept pushing the Buddhist angle at me  Because Rob has a friend  Who went Buddhist  And is up on a mountaintop somewhere  Feeling good about life  But not  You know  Competing like the rest of us  Yeah  Just existing  Thriving maybe  I don't know  Yeah  But not part of the rat race  But would you say that you're a happy person? 
[02:59:30]  No  I'm not a happy person  Fez would you say that you're a happy person?  No  I would say that I'm happy sometimes  Other times  I come in here  And the dark prince  Is fucking  That is his army against me  It's not a dark prince  There's no army  So you're never happy Fez?  Does that mean you say that you're not happy?  You're never happy  No  No  Because I'm always nervous  And nervous doesn't make me happy  Sunday  When I'm in my apartment 
[03:00:00]  If I stay in  I'm nervous  If I go out  And try to do something  Get out in the sun  To run away from the nerves  In the apartment  I'm still nervous  You think there's nerves  In the apartment?  It's like  Sometimes it's like  All of a sudden  The walls are closing in on me  And I gotta get outside  And then  I'm just nervous outside  I think you fucked up your meds  I tried to bring up  One of those two fucking 
[03:00:30]  Those two directors today  They didn't give a shit  Yeah they didn't have any answers  For Fez  Are you like Fez?  You were never happy?  Oh no  I was saying that  Overall I'm probably  I'm more unhappy  Than I'm happy  But yeah there's times  I'm happy of course  I'm not  No  Fez  Okay there's times  That you're happy  Are you ever just  Cat or just okay?  You know just sitting around  Yeah  But a lot of times  I feel  Have you ever said to yourself  Hey this feels good  Being content? 
[03:01:00]  Maybe I'll look back  And say  Hey I was feeling pretty good  That time  That was nice  But you can't feel it  At the time  Yeah I don't think I feel  Yeah I have a hard time  Feeling it in the moment  And then I'll look back  And I'll say  Oh wait  That was pretty good  Um  Bo you're on the  Run of Fez show  Uh hey  That bit with  The humming earlier  Was hilarious  I got in that time  But I'm calling about  The philanthropic thing  Of Shadiac  And it got  Awesome that he does that  But um 
[03:01:30]  And I'm not sure  If this is common knowledge  Or not  But George Lucas  After the sale  Of Star Wars  To Disney  That 4.03  Or 06 billion dollars  That he got  Not a cent of that  Was kept  And God knows  He's got enough money  But yeah  I think this is  Is a different situation  Because we could even  Go to Bill Gates  Bill Gates  Is giving away  More than George Lucas  But the fact of the matter is  It's not changing  Bill Gates' lifestyle  And this is not changing  George Lucas' lifestyle  No  Shadiac  Said  I'm giving away 
[03:02:00]  My stuff  Not my extra stuff  I'm giving away  Everything  All of it  I mean wouldn't you be shocked  If you heard that George Lucas  Was living in a trailer  Or something  That'd be fucking weird out  I will tell you the truth  I know this  For a fact  One of probably  The richest  People  In the country  At the time  Who has  Built  A brand  Still known today  And this brand 
[03:02:30]  Is probably over  100 years old  Gave away everything  And was living  In a one  Bedroom  Apartment  When he died  Gave everything away  Didn't you guys know this story  No  Sounds familiar  But I  Can't name the person  It wasn't familiar to me  Before I went there  And heard the story  I was stunned by it  Who was it  Not only  Is there a brand  Known all over the world  There's actually a town  Named after him 
[03:03:00]  Because there was no town  Until he started his factory  It's Hershey  Hershey died like that  He gave everything away  And very happily  Lived in  A  One bedroom  Or  Apartment  That was like  Almost like an old folks home  That he had built  You know what I mean  Something like that  Holy shit  Never  His intention never was  To make a lot of money  It was more  You know  To make this product  And to put people to work  And to have the fun of that  Damn 
[03:03:30]  I have never heard that story before  There's no way that you would  You would think  They're not going to show it  During a cartoon  It doesn't show up  During wrestling  Hicks  In your case  It's not written  In the bottom  Of a beer bottle  They should put little facts  Like that at the bottom  Though  Give me your lovable losers  Alright  Lovable losers  These are products  Brands  That  Brilliant  We're fucking loved  Give me the 
[03:04:00]  Shelved and Mullen  To see if they even  Have any idea  Now I'm going to  Probably  Say  Before I even look at your stuff  Yeah  I'm not a guy who loves brands  Yeah  So this may  Some of these  I may not know  Or care about them  That much  I found this interesting  Since the CBS  And Showtime  Have gotten off  And I've watched  Several shows  On both those networks  I've decided  Not to give it  A shit  And I haven't  That's good  I don't 
[03:04:30]  I just don't care  I think  It's like when they go  Oh they're not playing  Baseball this shit  I don't give a fuck  Good  I'll do something else  I'm just pointing that out  That I think I'm a  A little bit of like  A Tom Shadyac  Myself  Are you familiar  With this guy  At all  I'm not  I'm familiar with his work  I didn't know about his whole  God damn it  Shelby  And you're supposed to be  My number one comedy guy  Shelby  Where's your dinosaur song?  Unfortunately I  Not 
[03:05:00]  Don't have one  But I looked up  Like Tom Shadyac  But his trailer  It's pretty  It's a pretty nice  Kush trailer  That he's living in  I didn't expect him to live in a shit trailer  Come on  I mean  Is it gotta be rusty?  Why do you gotta fucking  Always attack  Like a nice thing  And act like  Yeah  But  Does he have a car  Or is he riding around on a bike?  Think unicycling  He doesn't even  Don't  Take up  Don't  Don't  Don't be like this  See he's my joker  He's the constant joker  Having a good time over there  Jokester  What if Google Facts 
[03:05:30]  Was fucking joking about everything?  I wouldn't know anything  Are you communicating with your family  To find those other tapes?  I've been communicating with them  And they've dug into the Disney vault  A.K.A.  My dad's computer  And dug up some pretty solid work  Oh really?  So we are gonna hear more?  Yes  Alright well first I'm gonna do  Chris Stanley's  Lovable Losers  What's up on the iBank?  Alright first  I thought this  When um  I bought a Sega Dreamcast off eBay 
[03:06:00]  Now  It came out in 2000  It was an old school video game system  Yeah  13 years old now  I don't know  For whatever reason  It caught me at the right time  Where I just became obsessed  With this video game system  I haven't really bought many  Since then  I don't play video games  That often  At all anymore  But  This system  Was the first to go online  It was  One of the first to have  You play four players at a time  It was  It was literally  Universally beloved  Then why  Why did it go away? 
[03:06:30]  How did they get beat?  The Playstation 2 came out  And  At the time  It was also when broadband  Was getting popular  Everyone was starting to get  Like cable modems  Yeah  And their video games  Were so easy to bootleg  And rip off  That it became  You could just download  Any new video game  So they killed the company  Yeah  By being  Fucking thieves  Pretty much  Yeah  And Sega has never made  Another video game system  Since  Once this failed  Their heart was broken  It just destroyed  Because it was  Fucking universal  Everyone was like  This thing is amazing 
[03:07:00]  At the time  In 2000  People were losing their shit  They had  It also had  Do you remember  NFL 2K2  It was like  The main comparator  To Madden  Before Madden  Got the NFL license  Like it was a major  It was a major  Major system  And then  But  I never played this game  At all  I never played  With this system  It's really  It was fucking fantastic  And I  Terrible how bad  That works  And we have people  Come in  At least you're here  Every day  People come in  And they don't know  What to do  These are the worst  Mic stands  I've ever seen  In my life 
[03:07:30]  There's a trick  To actually moving them  You have to have  Like a  It's a skill  Well we do a thing  Where we completely  Ignore people  Once we bring them in  A they're cold  They can't work  The chairs  And then B  They can't work  The mic stands  Alright so that was  The only lovable brand  That's gone  No no no  That was just  That was just  One of many  Also the Polaroid camera  I don't know  If anyone remembers  The Polaroid camera  That was around  For like fucking  40 years  Yeah but that  But then eventually  It just fucking died  Because people  Didn't want to have  Well all film died 
[03:08:00]  Yeah  I remember in  You know 9-11  I still had a  Filmed camera  At that time  So that was what  12 years ago  Yeah  And now I don't think  There's anywhere  I know in town  That you could do  The one hour  Film development  People just don't  Have film  But I will also say this  I don't think they care  About their pictures  As much as they used to  Oh without a doubt  No because  This phone  You'll have a thousand  Fucking pictures  On a cell phone  And then you'll have  A thousand on your  Facebook account 
[03:08:30]  It's disposable  You think it's disposable  I tell Molly  Do not take pictures  For your boyfriends  And send them out  Because they will end up  On exgirlfriend.com  No selfies  Right now  You trust Shelby  But later  When you break up  With him  You won't  He's going to do  Bad things  If you could be with  Either Shelby  Or Kokomo Joe  If it was a mystery date  Who would you go out with  Kokomo Joe  Okay it's not even close  Yeah I would choose Joe too 
[03:09:00]  You know something  Oh Jesus Christ  You're an awful person  What  It's an honest question  Huh  It's an honest answer  So sometimes be dishonest  Go ahead what else  Be a liar  PLTs  Is that the next thing  That disappeared  No  This is something Molly  I'd like to have that  For dinner tonight please  Now that I remind myself  Was said about  It's oxygenating  Fizzing  Cleaning  Cleanser  Cleaning clear  I don't even know  What this is  I know either 
[03:09:30]  She was like  This was the best  This was the greatest thing  Ever  You put it on your face  Dry  And it fizzed  It turned into like  This special foam  I've never heard of this  It was the greatest thing  In the world  I remember at summer camp  We used to steal it  From each other  That's how obsessed we were  And then  That's not good  I don't know  What happened to it  It went  I guess they discontinued  The product  And I seriously want  To use it again  Because I just  Can't believe  How awesome it was  So you put a dry powder  On your face  No no  It was like a gel  But you didn't wet your face 
[03:10:00]  And you just like  Spread it over your face  And it was like  A gel  And then eventually  It started to foam  It was the greatest thing  It's like a weird facial  Yeah it was like  A weird face wash  But it was like  It smelled great  I bet it's all  Because it's a bad chemical  For you  I bet kids' faces  Were coming off  How about if some weird  Lube or something  Should not have been  Putting that on your face  This makes a lot more sense  To me than the Polaroid  Which had a gigantic  Long run  And made everybody  Tons of money 
[03:10:30]  That  Just went by  Because time needed to leave  You know  The technology changed  I think people still love Polaroid  I think they're sad  That Polaroid's gone  All you gotta do is go get one  I know  And I hate to use the word hipster  Yeah  But I do know hipsters  Will carry around a Polaroid camera  But I assume  Ironically  No  No  You can go on eBay  Like I went and buy  A guy named Dreamcast  And you could buy  People just hoarded up  The fucking  The photos  But I think that instant film  Would still be popular 
[03:11:00]  It's not like that  People don't like film  That they like prefer  Digital quality  They just prefer  The like  The quickness of digital  Over instant film  But it's also pretty  A Polaroid film  And all is pretty expensive  Compared to  Just sitting and clicking  Your phone  Hack, hack, hack, hack, hack, hack  Yep, constantly  True  Alright, so  Foam face is gone  I miss it  I never heard of the  I never heard of this one at all  No, I don't  I've never used a face cleanser  In my life  Alright, what's the next one?  Shelby  Apparently what's going on 
[03:11:30]  About Oreo O's cereal  You could eat Oreos  For breakfast  It was a great time  For America  There were no rules  I did eat Oreos  For breakfast  I didn't eat a cereal  Well, not that  Not that kind of  An animal  Just eating  Oh shit  You're fooling yourself  Now  I used to play the  I said he's fooling himself  By acting like  The cereal  Was any better  Than the cookies  Why they discontinued it 
[03:12:00]  I don't know  I mean  You still had the  Cookie crisp cereal  But I mean  You know  You don't  Why waste your time  None of the  They treat cereals  Now like they're movies  Like they only come out  For a year  Yeah  And then they're gone  A cereal used to be  Like the Polaroid  You know  Cornflakes have always been here  Cheerios  But now if there's  Some kind of new cereal  You can  You know it's got  A short shelf life  We're never going to get  A major brand cereal  That lasts like the old ones  Now they have like  Fruity Cheerios 
[03:12:30]  When we already have  Fruit Loops  It's just  I don't know what's going on  In the cereal world  Alright I got an idea  For you  Yeah  Fruity  Cheerios  Cherry flavored Oreos  Oh shit  Oh no  It would be  Cherry flavored Cheerios  Oreos have nothing  To do with this  You can still actually  Get the Oreo cereal  In South Korea  Of all places  Like they just  Love it so much  They're like  No we'll continue it  In South Korea  Alright  I got an idea  It's called orgasms 
[03:13:00]  Every time you eat one  You have an orgasm  It's going to get messy  After a while  Everyone's going to love it  Just don't overeat  I can't stop jizzing  These fucking orgasms  Oh my god  I can't stop jizzing  The Chris Stanley stuff  It just keeps coming out  I hope somebody isolates that  And turns it into something  Yeah I'd like to isolate it  And then destroy it  Oh no  God  I never had Oreos 
[03:13:30]  Josh you're on the  Run at Fez show  Hey how's it going Ronnie  A little while ago  You were talking about  Hershey  Yeah  Me and my family  Go to Hershey  Pennsylvania quite often  And they have a  Trolley ride you can take  And they tell you  The history of the town  And Mr. Hershey  He not only did he  Give his money away  But when he did have the money  He would choose a child  From the neighborhood  And bring him  To live with him  Put him through school  Put him through college  And then give him a job 
[03:14:00]  Right afterwards  That's a great man  So he gave a lot  A lot  A lot back  To the community  Was he a certain  Religion though  Was he like  I don't remember  Med the night  Or something  I'm not sure  But I know  Like if you go up  To Hershey Pennsylvania  And you go up  On the other side  Of the factory  You go up on the hill  You can actually see his house  And he has all these  Other houses next to it  And that's where  He used to put up the kids  The lights there  Look like Hershey  Like little Hershey kisses 
[03:14:30]  Cool  Yeah  And they have  Old wooden  Roller coasters  It feels like you're  In 1900  But then they put in  The new roller coasters  Which  I mean what's the whole point  And candy bars  Also walk around the park  And wave to you  Like hi  I'm a crackle  You're the best  Yeah  Hi crackle  I think you're sweet  Aww  One of the class  Tripped  One of the class  Tripped Hershey Park  It was awesome  I had a friend  I used to go up there too 
[03:15:00]  I had a friend  Who like he  He was like a singer  In a band  During the past summer  He worked  In like a barbershop  Quartet there  Like audition  Like a strenuous process  What kind of fucking  Cool people  Are you hanging out with  Barbershop quartets  It's a pretty rough crowd  Bum bum  Bum bum bum bum  Bum  Here she'll be  Bum  Bum  Bum  Bum  Bum  Well  Oh  They are Mendenites  Milton Hershey was a Mendenite 
[03:15:30]  Huh  And that's like a  It's like a low grade Amish  Yeah  It's like an Amish  Who'll use a urinal  Yeah they get like a pass  Or whatever  To act in  Fucking modern times  There's no pass  Well I watched that  Fuck one of those Amish  Reality TV shows  Mendenite is not an Amish  Mendenite is like  What a Protestant is  To a Catholic  It's low grade  Come on  It's watered down  Bullshit  Yeah  They shouldn't even be  Associated with the Amish  Because Amish are hardcore  Those guys don't give a fuck  Amish is the real deal 
[03:16:00]  They don't give a fuck  They ain't using electricity  But they wouldn't  Start a Hershey factory  You know  They make chocolate  Out of wood there  They fucking  Nasty  I like the way  They fried chicken  I'm not gonna lie to you  Never had any  I like a family style  You never went over  To Amish country  And ate  No never  You go over there  And they just put out  This like  Real simple food  It's like mashed potatoes  And corn  And big bowls of fried chicken  And you just sit  And eat with them  Sounds awesome  Yeah  It's delicious  Let's go there  They always had quality denim 
[03:16:30]  Whenever I saw  I'm like  You know what  It's true  They think denim every day  Like overalls  Are never out with them  They're like  Fuck no  We need overalls  But  You know  The horse and buggy thing  You can't have a horse and buggy  And then try to go down the highway  You gotta be like  Dude we're not keeping up  Either you're horse and buggy  On the grass  Or you just don't do it  That's my opinion  I found out  All those horse and buggy horses  Are all just broken down race horses 
[03:17:00]  They go to the tracks  And buy them  And sell them back to the farmers  Here's Phil  You're on the run and face show  Hey Ronnie  I know what religion  The Hershey guy was  He was  He was a chocolatier  Are you done?  Are you done being the least funniest person in the world?  Jason you're on the run and face show  Hey buddy  Is that a spy report?  Good  We need one  This just in  On Oprah Radio's Twitter 
[03:17:30]  So happy to announce  That Troy Kwan  Will not be getting fired  And he says a huge thanks  To Sirius XM  For doing the right thing  Spy report  Beautiful  Fez's little bit  Did not go as planned  Congratulations Troy  Nice  No  Get even with him  There he is  That was not my plan  Crosshairs  I've seen some really interesting spellings  Of the last name Kwan  Throughout this whole thing  People get really creative  That's good news 
[03:18:00]  Congratulations Troy  Nice  You ducked  Whatley's wrath  You can't beat that  He got lit up a little bit  But he's standing tall now  And Fez  This is the worst thing  When you attempt to kill someone  And you don't finish the job  I did not attempt to kill anyone  You better keep your head on swivel now  And I guess we're all free to use that word  Oh yeah  That's one thing we've learned  Hallways are going to be flush with it 
[03:18:30]  Sure  Why not  What else you got  Surge soda  A few people wanted to talk about this  Because apparently  I never drank Surge  But it was ridiculously popular  It was like I guess a Mountain Dew  It was the first speed  Right  It was the first speed  Jolt before that  But then yeah  Surge I guess was just super caffeinated  Mountain Dew like  I used to get jacked up  Hardcore on this  Well you're getting more of a sugar high 
[03:19:00]  Or a caffeine high  Kind of a body high with it  Okay  But now like  Every soda  You're in the barbershop quartet  Be bugging  Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum  Like every soda now  Is pretty much this  But people like  Are still reminiscing about it  Yeah there's a safesurge.com  People are still trying  Trying to get coke to remake it  Like please  Please make more Surge  We need more  It's really weird  Let's fucking Mountain Dew  Let's not make a big deal out of it  I know  That's what I'm saying 
[03:19:30]  But people can't get enough of this shit  And then there's the flip cameras  Remember flip cameras  They died out  Everyone loved them  And when Cisco  Cisco Computers bought them  That was pretty  That was pretty much the end  And with the development of smartphones  Having better video  The flip camera  Just gone  It was sad  Because there was a lot  It was a lot  It's a great product  It was a tiny little HD camera  It was perfect  And GoPro also put them out 
[03:20:00]  Because now everyone's using GoPros  And that guy's worth a few billion dollars  But you should be  Because I've never seen something take over  The way it has that  Everything  Yeah half the YouTubes are now GoPros  Every aspect of life now is just GoPros  And finally  The Trio TV network  Which died  Officially died out 2005  And I feel like it was ahead of its time  Because it was a pop culture  It was a pop culture  It was very cool  It was a really cool network  When they did  Brilliant but Cancelled  Was the best thing 
[03:20:30]  That's ever been on TV  They would do  Shows that didn't get picked up  And you'd see a pilot  With people  That you know from other shows  Attempting this one thing  And it was great  It was terrific  It just  It just started too early  If someone launched Trio today  Here's the difference  Nothing that points even slightly high  Can make it  So Trio would have some really nice music things  Bravo used to be the same way 
[03:21:00]  And they turned into whores smacking each other  And if you want to be  If you want to have success now  Whores smacking each other  You will find out  Most people are not cool  And have a taste for shit  Sad  Speaking of  Taste for shit  Looks like Watley just ate ass  Because  You tried something  It didn't work  And now you gotta live with the consequences  This changes everything  Alright I gotta break  One more time  One last time
