<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristically vulgar banter, featuring jokes about sexually transmitted infections and sexual acts.  The conversation then transitioned to the upcoming MLB All-Star Game in New York City, focusing on its economic impact and the planned street closure. Opie suggested outlandish home run derby ideas, such as hitting home runs from a skyscraper. The discussion then shifted to environmental issues, comparing American and Chinese pollution levels and criticizing George W. Bush's stance on global warming.  The high price of Babe Ruth's sweat-stained cap and the possibility of cloning him were also debated.

A listener called to complain about the replacement of the Opie and Anthony show in Syracuse with "Shut Up and Rock," leading to a discussion about their show's popularity and cancellations in various markets. The hosts then dissected the New Yorker magazine cover depicting the Obamas in controversial attire, sparking debate about satire and political commentary. A significant portion of the show replayed a past call with a doctor offering sinus and snoring advice to Jimmy, during which the hosts were incredibly rude and dismissive.  They later acknowledged and expressed embarrassment over their behavior.  Further banter followed, touching on an iPhone radio app and the arrest of a Catholic school principal for a nude encounter. The segment concluded with a listener confirming iPhone app usage and a discussion of a disturbing pornographic video.

The broadcast continued with a detailed and graphic description of disturbing videos depicting a woman vomiting while performing oral sex on a man. The hosts then turned to Barry Bonds' struggles to secure a Major League Baseball contract, speculating on the reasons for teams' reluctance.  Listener calls followed, offering their opinions. The replacement of their show in Syracuse by "Shut Up and Rock" was again discussed, with the hosts playing and mocking audio clips from the replacement show and fielding angry calls from Syracuse listeners.  The hosts then discussed the arrest of British women in Greece for participating in a filmed oral sex competition, which triggered a reminiscence about their own infamous "TNA with ONA" event in Buffalo, detailing its unplanned escalation into a large-scale public sexual encounter.

Seth Green appeared as a guest.  Their conversation covered Green's recent movie viewing, Hollywood experiences, work on "Robot Chicken" (including the upcoming "Star Wars" special),  and the casting of his role in a film originally intended for Colin Quinn.  A significant portion focused on "Back to the Future," with anecdotes and behind-the-scenes information. Green also discussed an old, unaired Nerf commercial. The conversation included mentions of staff members Danny, Stunt Brain, Jimmy, Travis, and Sam.  A second segment with Seth Green involved a discussion of his career and experiences meeting celebrities like Denzel Washington and Burt Reynolds, including an anecdote about a dinner cooked by Dom DeLuise.  The conversation also touched on the hosts' and a female guest, Jess, preferences for celebrities to sleep with. The focus dramatically shifted to "vagpoop.com," a website featuring photos and videos from a past Buffalo event described as a beach party that devolved into a large-scale orgy. The hosts graphically described the content using highly offensive language, with a caller expressing regret at missing the event due to military deployment.  An emergency broadcast system test interrupted the descriptions, causing comedic disruption.  The segment concluded with further discussion of the explicit content and an eye exam for Roland, revealing his poor vision, followed by brief discussion of a prior Gene Simmons appearance.

The show's final segment started with a discussion of improv, featuring a student's performance and the hosts' commentary, followed by criticism of a producer named Derek. A sexually suggestive parody of "Little Teapot" was sung.  Audio clips regarding the high rate of abortions of fetuses diagnosed with Down syndrome were played, sparking a discussion marked by offensive language and crude jokes. Several callers shared personal anecdotes about family members with Down syndrome, some highlighting challenges, others emphasizing the joy they brought.  The conversation continued with offensive jokes and comments about individuals with Down syndrome interspersed with humorous tangents and off-topic discussions. A song mocking individuals with Down syndrome was played. The segment concluded with more off-color jokes, discussions about celebrities, and casual banter, including a call from a cross-dresser. A musical interlude and mention of a website ended the broadcast.  The segment featured numerous instances of offensive language and insensitive humor.

[00:08:30]  in derby fashion in derby fashion they'll wear ron hats  this is what i know on that one dude hit uh 28 home runs in the first round which is  kind of amazing that's pretty big josh hamilton yeah josh hamilton that's a new record or something  like that yeah bobby abreu had the first round or the single round record at 24 from a few years  ago but this hamilton kid who was a all right hamilton well he was the number one draft pick 
[00:09:00]  in 99 then he lost his mind to uh drugs and alcohol and he's had nine rehabs since then  wow he came back and he's kind of had a heck of a year so far he's leading the american league in  homers i believe he came back in 2006 i think and then he got yep wait how many years was he out  i i didn't know it was that long i didn't know it was seven years he's really been uh drifting for  the last seven years and he finally got his life together and in the first round he he hit 28 home 
[00:09:30]  runs most of them massive almost out of the stadium completely on a couple occasions wait did you say  you you said stadium oh uh they didn't go with my idea off the brooklyn no no they couldn't get  that together couldn't get off the top of a skyscraper that's how you do a home run derby in new  york city i'm sorry short short notice yeah oh really they're hearing it yesterday on this show  and then getting it together yeah i think they tried though come on man how about all right i 
[00:10:00]  because you you made fun of my idea yesterday and then i'm thinking then i'm thinking how about  a skyscraper that faces the river my friend oh now you're talking all right allow the boaters out  there you get some uh you get some of those barges and yeah and you could like kind of hang  out on a barge and check out the home run derby and here's these animals just on top of a skyscraper  that's come on you so you're saying you allow some of the public to go out on barges in the middle 
[00:10:30]  of the river well they would have to be off to the side mitts on and stuff no go back for it go back  up oh no they'll have to be off to the side kind of like they can they could kind of make a very  primitive looking stadium out of barges you got your josh hamilton on a skyscraper on the roof  and he's hitting on home runs into the river that's how you do a home run derby especially  in new york city with the additional height wow that would be dude be pretty far you want to talk  about a publicity stunt you'd have the whole world talking about what what they did in new york city 
[00:11:00]  that's all i'm thinking because like uh travis is a big hockey fan now now they're doing this you  outside hockey thing every year outside hockey that's preposterous and and the world takes notice  my friend it's snowing and they're they're playing nhl hockey outside yeah i think they're doing one in  fenway in like two years two years what and they were talking about one at yankee stadium yeah january  i think what was the one the uh last year was in buffalo it was in buffalo yeah in buffalo in the  middle of winter they're playing an outdoor hockey game well that seems to make sense but uh 
[00:11:30]  i don't know my idea doesn't make sense skyscraper facing the river so no one gets hurt  the liability factor in what you've brought up is crazy i know you're not a big fan of the lawyer  but wow imagine trying to get that past any lawyer well you just can you want to be on top of a  skyscraper uh smacking balls into a river where there's barges full of people i'm yes yes i like it 
[00:12:00]  and i think we should expand it how about we have people on the street and you drop a ball and  whoever catches it wins a prize oh that's good from the top of the empire off like the empire  state building that'll be nice baseball size holes in people's heads going straight through and  coming out their groin life has become mundane yeah life has become too safe we gotta mix it up a  little bit i think uh screw this all-star game for yankee stadium they want the yankee stadium to go out 
[00:12:30]  in style yeah gladiators all right bring back i'm just for one season gladiators you get to get  them right from rikers it's close you just get them and whoever wins gets released fight to the death  swords tigers just like the movie gladiator fight to the death you're on yankee stadium i i we have a lot  of boys that listen and uh at rikers yeah the good guys and the bad guys sure we got a little of both 
[00:13:00]  i would imagine there's some guys doing some heavy sentences up there that would that would  take this chance take the chance fight to the death fight to the death you win you're out of jail  maces big friggin shields yeah and they just beat each other to pieces like in the movie i like it  i like it life is becoming too huh yeah you're like yeah what's happening all right  their their their uh excitement today is a an 18 block red carpet who cares and they're making a 
[00:13:30]  big to do about it and who's walking this red carpet the the major league uh all-stars and who else  like local dignitaries and some of the old timers who've been in town signing autographs and all that  really yeah it's a big uh is it true now i hear is it true uh ted williams head is going to be rolled  down the uh red carpet it is frozen somewhere in some cryogenics lab it is yeah is it still frozen 
[00:14:00]  it's gotta be you know we don't have to freeze his whole body we can freeze his head nice good morning  boston it's a lot cheaper to just freeze the head for some reason and they think uh in the future  you could take that head out of freezing and uh bring it back now listen to me this uh this idea i  came with up with is far-fetched to you right just a little yeah watch what happens next year someone  took notice of our little uh home run derby uh talk you watch what happens next year gonna add spice it 
[00:14:30]  up with a little skyscraper baseball or just a little behind the nhl they're doing the right thing  outdoor hockey baseball is gonna figure something out that you're gonna you're gonna be thinking oh  my god that's insane but how cool is that yeah yes it's time uh let's say hi to johnny cakes on  long island johnny cakes hey guys the only reason they they won't do it off of skyscraper is because  they can't charge 350 a ticket you gotta figure that out yeah they gotta make some money on this 
[00:15:00]  see ya that guy brings up a good point it's all about the the almighty dollar the almighty dollar  yeah let's say hi to brian in uh syracuse brian  hey what's up man hey how you doing hey what's up man i don't hear you on 95x out here anymore  what's going on well because farid thought it would be smart to take the opian anthony show off the air for  a show called shut up and rock and all we're getting is calls from syracuse an email from

[00:26:00]  i mean this guy and my therapist even checked everybody says that about their doctor though  no no no he's the best i hear that so many but he has plaques all over the wall it was looked up we  looked him up online and my therapist got back to me because she knows a lot of people in the medical  and she said she said that this guy is great so we're talking and we're talking he sprays my nose

[00:27:30]  what show you on xm and when he said that i was like uh why is this our reaction every time someone  asks us because we know what do you mean why is it every time yeah because what show i try to write  uh down uh i'm in marketing i whenever it's someone out of the demo by the way whenever it's somebody you  know a guy between you know 18 and 40 years old or something like that like in the demo you kind of  just like say yeah opian anthony show yeah but when it's a doctor a 52 year old woman an older woman 
[00:28:00]  that perhaps is a friend of a girlfriend or a relative or whatever you go like  here it comes yeah i avoid that though i say i'm in marketing marketing yeah i market laughs or  something i don't know but well i like i like people to know that especially doctors because  if they know you're on the radio they'd probably be nicer to you because i'm always afraid they're  afraid you're gonna or not nice to you depending well he goes what show you on and i'm like uh it's 
[00:28:30]  almost like if you're if if someone said hey what's what's the name of your uncle he was a clown in  chicago he got into a bit of trouble oh right um things buried in his house yeah okay and he goes  what show are you on i'm like uh i'll be anthony he goes what anthony he goes oh i was on that show  oh and it wasn't i was on that show it was i was on that show oh no and uh i know i i knew better than 
[00:29:00]  to go well how was it yeah just from his reaction you knew it was an unpleasant experience so i was  like yeah you know a lot of people come on bacteria let's get back to the back yeah please and i'm  like and he's like yeah they were uh they weren't very nice to me oh oh no and i'm like well i wanted  this of course they weren't i mean why would they be you're a doctor who helps people why should  they be nice to you of course and i say they as in weeks i remember that day oh no awful and uh oh 
[00:29:30]  no i vaguely remember his call he goes it started off very uh kind of good natured and fun and then  they just got mean and i'm like um oh no i was talking of timmy i'm like yeah they do that sometimes  they're really nice guys you know hope he doesn't live too far from me and anthony's a really good guy  he's in a relationship and he's happy and stump brain just came i am yapping about anything to keep  it moving and uh he's like yeah he's like at the end of the call he's like i was just kept talking and  nobody would answer ah the silent game and then they just started snoring oh i'm like this is a man 
[00:30:00]  who's gonna take the equivalent of a drill in my skull because this is the guy i want the surgery from  he really is is it safe that's exactly it's safe but i think he'll do the surgery well but i'm afraid  he's gonna let a little anesthesia slip happen right yeah we'll give you almost enough oops you'll  wake up 40 minutes into it into yeah yeah with it just a drilling pain in your head and see my face 
[00:30:30]  he'll be drilling into me and i'll have worse stuff playing with a loudspeaker and he'll be snoring  funny huh oh i was so embarrassed but why why did he call our show yeah what's the bad story i don't  remember i'll find out i didn't want to ask no i don't want to go by the way what was the call  about that we i wonder if he was promoting something i think he said he was not it wasn't a book or  anything it might have just been a call in something we were talking about and he decided  yeah he decided to uh make that mistake of actually calling our show and trying to contribute 
[00:31:00]  something but you want to tell people no you don't understand we forget that you're real people  yeah forget that you're human we're just trying to make people laugh we don't realize there's an  actual person on the other end with dicks right i felt so that's funny it is though when it when  somebody asks it depends on the person sometimes just like oh boy how am i going to get around this  what show and then uh i like when um especially yeah older women they pull out a little pen and  paper and go what's the station because i'm gonna have to give that a listen yeah uh marjorie marjorie 
[00:31:30]  uh he's on the radio yes it's uh but nine two three what it's on nine two three ninety two that's  where you're stupid when they ask me which station i go oh uh 10 10 wins yeah i do the news no i'm not  even kidding you don't get my name's john montone we go uh ninety uh five point three oh yeah you know  something you're right why would you give them why would i see because then you see them next time 
[00:32:00]  they just avoid you someone thinks they know the phone call that this doctor uh uh gave us  today rob long island i think you're a faithful listener to this fine show what do you got rob  oh yeah this happened probably about a year ago as soon as jimmy mentioned that it was a nose doctor  this guy called up promoting something about a year ago on xm and uh if i'm not mistaken it was  actually jimmy who was being a douche to the sky he started his uh famous little bit you know okay  no no no why don't you talk no i'm not finished just go ahead oh no it wouldn't surprise oh yeah 
[00:32:30]  but why did the guy call in that's what we really need to why don't you be the doctor why don't you  drill your own nose i'll just stand here that's what he's gonna do why do you put yourself back  under now that it hurts yeah a lot of people say they called in about sleep problems and snoring  is that true rob oh that would make sense it was about snoring jimmy jimmy was complaining that he  has problems like snoring and this guy every time jimmy recommended something or uh jimmy started  talking this guy chimed in jimmy oh no no no you know you're the doctor not just go ahead and speak  so actually you were the problem i was the problem and now you're seeing this guy good luck to you but 
[00:33:00]  it was looking him up online i gotta say and then when my therapist called because she knows she knows  some of the deals like all malpractice people and she checks every doctor out and she said oh he's great  you're in good hands and i'm gonna show up and realize the error of my ways he's uh he was a  victim of this show yeah well you know we do the best we can we are idiots we're not good people  no we're we're very nasty bad people people the guy probably was like you know i'm listening to a 
[00:33:30]  guy it sounds like he's got a problem why don't i why don't i do the right thing call up i'll give  him some advice and there he is sitting on the phone on hold probably and then click hi opie and  anthony show hey how you doing yeah i'm a doctor i'm okay good let me uh uh tell ask jimmy you know  and he'll tell you what the problem is and jimmy probably was telling him he goes yeah well that's  uh what i would and then jimmy goes oh no why don't you just talk then why don't you talk yeah 
[00:34:00]  i um i could see the whole thing playing out so can i it was decent human being a guy who was probably  calling to help with a problem that i'm having yeah and i just chimed in on the beat down for no  reason oh i'm not a leader i'm a follower and now you're seeing the guy i just hope it ends up like  some nazi experiment with you it's not seeing the guy yeah he's gonna reconstruct my face  this is this this is not he's not stitching my thumb after i cut it he can make you sound like 
[00:34:30]  this all the time imagine if he should just sewed my nose shut and then sewed my mouth shut and left  a straw size hole breathe through that stupid the whole time while you're under oh i'll get you funny  boy all right listen we got to move on because we got lots going on today what's up with this obama  and the cover of the new yorker do we have a problem with this uh this is the new yorker does  reverend al sharpton have a problem no no no no the a few people have a problem but the nobody of 
[00:35:00]  real merit uh what the new yorker did was they their cover is a picture of barack obama dressed as  a terrorist he's got you know the little turban gear on and stuff and he's dressed kind of like  osama bin laden um and then his uh lovely wife and they're giving each other the fist bump and  his wife has a big angela davis afro uh and she's uh toting um i think a machine gun looking uh a bit 
[00:35:30]  black powerish yeah yeah yeah it's uh they're supposed to look like terrorists there's a an  american flag burning in the fireplace yeah uh and what the new yorker was going for that i think a lot  of people missed was this is how the republicans and a lot of conservatives are portraying barack  obama and his wife right or not saying they or what they fear the most right it's it's this climate of  fear that they have that uh him having some whatever it is muslim background um and uh his wife and the 
[00:36:00]  black extremists just that was their point not to say that he's a terrorist but to parody the fact that  a lot of people uh have this fear and the the head of the new yorker was saying this is what it is  because whoever's complaining about this is misunderstanding everything that we put out there and then  bloomberg got a comment about it saying that i think their uh attempted humor missed the mark 
[00:36:30]  um which i think you can't judge that and it wasn't humor it was a sarcastic right it's not supposed to  be this haha funny thing it's supposed to be a little thought provoking you know a parody like  that in um uh i mean the new yorker is a pretty respected magazine it's not hustler uh but they  do have the freedom to to print that kind of stuff absolutely the obama campaign calls the illustration  tasteless and offensive entitled the politics of fear it depicts obama wearing traditional muslim clothing 
[00:37:00]  sandals robe and turban while his wife michelle has an assault rifle slung over her shoulder  her hair in an afro a flag burns in the fireplace behind them the magazine barely hit the stands  before the cries of outrage this is an absolute distortion distortion it plays to religious and  racial bigotries michelle with an afro wig him and muslim garbage river now all of the ridiculous 
[00:37:30]  notions that we hope we're getting out of american politics i guess reverend now didn't get it  no it's amazing how how many dummies are in this country wow is a dummy he really and what was it  what was it entitled uh do you know stump brain they just said that the thing was entitled at the  beginning of that piece yeah we don't listen though oh my god and the post the daily news annoyed me  because it says here they have barack climate of fear or something and it says politics of fear  it says one day after the new yorker released and then in quotes satirical cover no it's a satirical 
[00:38:00]  cover right what where's the quote why are there quotes around that satirical cover it is  huh okay we are just here's what the new york dummies had to say the new yorker had no apologies  because it's a magazine statement satire is what we do and it is meant to bring things out into the  open to hold up a mirror to prejudice the hateful and the absurd and that's the spirit of this cover 
[00:38:30]  good the fact that they have to explain that because sharpton is i mean i mean he's a stupid  man he's not a bright guy no he's not good at defending points he's a dummy and the but it's  amazing when you read these letters to the editor how people want the editor to step down you should  step down sir oh god don't you get it well the cw hit the streets to get the uh the man on the street  angle ah jimmy loves the man on the street angle who doesn't helpful uh here we go in a sampling of 
[00:39:00]  opinion on the street we found mixed sentiments i don't find it offensive no um i think they're  trying to make a satirical comment but you satire no that's an insult if they're trying to make a  point i don't think they made clearly that's disgusting the new yorker probably doesn't have  many african americans on the editorial staff or somebody would have stopped this yeah i find it  why and i think the new yorker should uh uh get as many of those off the uh newsstands yes burn them 
[00:39:30]  put them in a big pile and burn them with books and other things you jerk what are you talking about  get them go don't let people see it get them off the news unbelievable where do we live in iran  this is america on friggin believable you're allowed to do this in america and the guy who's like  well he doesn't have a lot of african americans don't black people get sarcasm or no they don't  get sarcasm no no if you if you're a black guy and you get to the point where you're working for 
[00:40:00]  the new yorker and you're on the editorial staff uh you still be too stupid i guess to uh get the  humor of the uh the cover or actually maybe talk to the artist uh about what his intent was  oh to me it's so obvious what that was it it especially on the new yorker like i said it's  not hustler or something where you know something like that might be portrayed just for the hell of 
[00:40:30]  it like that or or you know some maybe even a hard right wing republican um right the publication  yeah something like that but it's the new yorker they're known for satire stupid bad satire a lot  of times i hate their jokes i don't get them yeah like like at the urinal are they highbrow  very highbrow at the urinal sometimes like fancy restaurants that have like a little cartoon over  it yeah and it's always some it's a guy in a suit it's kind of drawn heart like a bad sketch 
[00:41:00]  and he's going well biff the merger is not supposed to go through but acquisitions is on vacation  and you get a little chuckle no you don't i don't get it i don't get it she's the guy talking  they just make you feel stupid this one's over my head i don't get this they're awful it's like a  kathy cartoon i hate kathy of course you do she's terrible she's a little black and white lesbian no 
[00:41:30]  one likes kathy kathy stinks uh uh by the way a lot of people saying they remember the the call  from the doctor and you it was all about you making fun of him as he's trying to help you  with your snoring and your sleep problems and sinuses and this guy offers free advice  and you're just trashing him and we got the phone call we're gonna play after the break oh good we  are i gotta hear this well because you were very vague like i don't know he said he called in the 
[00:42:00]  show and we kind of did something and then oh no no it was all you jimmy i know this time it was all  you i don't remember and now you're seeing this guy and now he's gonna do major surgery on your  sinuses oh no and all he's got a big plaques on his wall he's got like matt he's got like a new  yorker cover like he named as one of the top doctors in new york like it's for was that satirical  no oh okay well that would suck one of the best doctors in the world  malik from asbury park malik my brother yo what up my nigga hi malik i wish i could say that back 
[00:42:30]  but i would get fired my friend we're thinking it we're thinking it all the time though don't you  worry what do you got malik yeah yeah listen i first seen that picture too on the news man i you  know coming from the black community side of thought i didn't think that um it was a joke i  didn't i didn't understand the uh the satire or or the sarcasm about it but after hearing your angle  of it i kind of see where it's coming from but i think during a time like this where you have these 
[00:43:00]  sentiment and feelings coming from a lot of people from the right wing it's like i don't think that  was in good taste what if that was on the cover of like uh ebony or jet or something  and uh uh that that was would that make it a little more apparent that it was sarcasm  like wow look at what some people think absolutely not if it was on the cover of hip-hop weekly it 
[00:43:30]  still wouldn't have been accepted i mean just but it's supposed to show that this climate of fear of  what what people think of them and uh some of some of the fears that americans have that oh my god  these are two people that uh are um uh you know a little a little uh militant or uh yeah uh muslim  the word muslim always comes up like a i think it's obvious especially since the new yorker is  a liberal publication very liberal and she's holding a gun michelle obama's holding a machine gun which 
[00:44:00]  to me completely gives it away as being sarcastic because nobody would draw something that they meant  with her with a gun it just doesn't make sense right i mean i completely agree i see your point  but i think um just just to post a picture like that i mean you know i think they were just leading  to try to say something they could have had like a big you know title or or or something or headline  saying something like this is what america thinks you know it's not you can't be that blatant 
[00:44:30]  i don't want to over explain it malik i mean political i i have a lot of respect for political  cartoonists because when you like sometimes the new york post i read these political points they  make and they really are brilliant with like a one caption shot and sometimes they'll draw like the  name sharpton or bush on the guy's chest so you know who it is but i mean they're really great at  making a point with a simple uh i think there's a real brilliance to what those political cartoonists  do so i don't think they should over explain it all right hey thank you malik all right  all right uh after the break we got the phone call from this doctor that now is going to be 
[00:45:00]  doing is it nice iraq oh it's nice i bet iraq just listen to the whole thing to make sure it's clean  what do you got there on this call um the ending of the call is unnecessary but it is very funny  unnecessary okay unnecessary do i finally make up with him and go look no no i bet not oh i can't  wait to end and i don't want to hear it and you got it yeah i want to hear this  and you got to let us know if this is the doctor you're now seeing i already know it is i'm sure 
[00:45:30]  of course all right listen uh don't go anywhere trust me it's going to be it's going to be a bit  fun after the break opie and anthony  opie and anthony bad boy radio host opie and anthony opie and anthony on your radio dial  what what what what what 877-212-018 oh i want to do what jimmy i can't hear you  huh i want to do a quick recap on what's the apps oh what's the app sure what's the apps we're

[00:51:30]  uh radio show do they that's scary that's another like thing they use to see if we're being successful  or not for that yeah oh your your web hits are way up this month good job good job great more  things that are rated yeah of course we have to worry about we got the doctor phone call but first  really fast because i'm looking at this huge flat screen behind anthony's head and i see principal  arrested so i go to the guys what's that story about yeah why do you think the principal was arrested 
[00:52:00]  how about we go around the room and guess something okay can i get one hint is it something  just a little arrested that's all you need to know a little sexy oh well but what kind of uh sexy  okay let's see i'll say the principal was doing the sexy yes looking through some kind of hidden  device a hole a camera and uh uh getting some type of images of girls in the locker room my guess  yes working the kids too hard before the spelling bee 
[00:52:30]  that's my guess i would have gone for that first damn here's your hint he's a catholic school  principal all right uh just change mine from the girls locker room to the boys  this uh this guy's a naughty boy oh is he naughty  oh school principal is among three men facing charges for allegedly having a nude trist in a 
[00:53:00]  backyard police in greenberg say they found the men having sex behind a vacant home on abbeville lane  sunday night 41 year old gabriel de jesus 31 year old francesco aterra were arrested and released  without bail de jesus is the principal of sacred heart school for the arts in mount vernon the third man  possibly involved remains at large i thought it was in mount franco  uh they uh they needed to get it oh wait can i ask who the guy at large is 
[00:53:30]  they're not gonna catch him no let's go to let his penis in the yard all right you got me it's mine  the guy at large maybe he's the guy it's small  i guess there was two cops and two guys and when there's three of you in a circle  so they uh they have one guy at large and they have a cracker which nobody wants to  all right uh rob c from queens he writes ha ha ha i love jimmy but that day i cringed for the poor 
[00:54:00]  doctor ha ha ha my girlfriend called him an animal you want to we got some uh people tuning in for the  first time jimmy so the quick setup before we replay this phone call from a couple years ago  i did something i feel bad about it no i'm getting my sinuses fixed finally and my uh i i go and i i have  a look up the best doctor one of the best doctors in new york for sinus surgery  my uh there's articles all over the internet about this guy my uh therapist confirms with me 
[00:54:30]  she checks some people in the medical profession she knows who like know all the legal stuff and  people who have malpractices and she she calls me while i'm in his waiting office she goes this  guy is is great you're in excellent hands with this guy and it turns out he was a guest on this  program and it it didn't go well which is shocking because normally we have a respectable person like  that we handle it very well well you guys got to it got to talk and he asked you what you do and  you said ah you know this and that and i also work for xm and he's like oh what show and you said 
[00:55:00]  opian anthony and he said well i was on that show and it didn't go too well and it turns out he was  calling the show because you were bitching about your sinuses and this guy as an expert was trying  to help trying to help you out and now this this karma thing is a little bit strange because now you're  seeing this actual doctor he's not prescribing antihistamines he's gonna put me out under in a  surgical setting right and change the internal structure of my head 
[00:55:30]  it's going to affect my breathing my life force i'm putting my life in this guy yeah i hope he does  it with maggots shoves a few maggots up your nose dude i'm all going into his office there was a big  fat girl who was like it before me and i could hear her from the uh from the waiting room crying  hey surgery is gonna be paid for their fat mother was there trying to comfort her i wanted to clunk  both of their big fat heads together clunk stop your whinging cow that's it with that said here's 
[00:56:00]  a phone call uh i don't know year maybe two years ago no it's back in 06 that's two years ago jimmy  yeah i know but he said you're jumping on my face no no i'm not i'm correcting him oh because  zerox said a year ago i'm saying it's 06 all right and uh and here you go are there certain foods  that are more likely to cause um like i have i have a very bad thing in the back of my throat  where i'm always going and i always have to clear my throat does that tie it in with my nasal drip 
[00:56:30]  like i take mucinex a lot yes especially dairy products make that worse all right you go ahead i  wasn't done but go ahead yeah a dairy product is that the doctor jimmy that you're now seeing  it sounds like it could be him he wasn't even really doing anything wrong he really wasn't no  are there certain foods that are more likely to cause um like i have i have a very bad thing in the back 
[00:57:00]  of my throat where i'm always going and i always have to clear my throat does that tie it in with my  nasal drip like i take mucinex a lot yes especially dairy products make that worse all right you go  ahead i wasn't done but go ahead yeah uh dairy products will make the saliva thicker and uh and  and give you more of a problem like that a lot of times i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt my 
[00:57:30]  question a lot of times i'll have uh coffee and like i'm fine and yet i'll have a cup of coffee and  the next thing you know i gotta take like two mucinex so i'm not like clear my throat every 10  seconds yeah do you have cream in the coffee what's that yeah jump right in cream in the coffee no i  don't i have uh fat free or lactaid yeah well that that that'll do it too all right well will it  yeah so drink it black see what i can't drink it black okay i don't like it black i'm trying to say  help me here henry if i want well why don't you drink hawaiian punch nah that does it to the 
[00:58:00]  certain beverage that just do it but it really is like a problem for me i always have a feeling  i get this like thin trail of booger spit in the back of my throat it drives me let me tell you  go ahead sorry i didn't mean to tell you something you're right you you would know you're the doctor  all right you're making fun of it but mucus is good we can't live without i didn't say let's  remove all mucus like it's in the warsaw ghetto in 1941 i was simply saying how do i stop clearing my  throat all the time well i don't really know what to do about it's driving me nuts

[01:02:30]  that embarrassed by that because it was it was just a stupid bit but it was hysterical but but it was  nothing like really nasty and we weren't ripping up his book you know yeah yeah that's the first  thing i'm like i'm like you didn't call to promote a book did you because i'm like i know that wouldn't  have went well so that that was a little embarrassing but i don't feel as bad about that all right we  gotta take a quick break we're gonna continue we're gonna listen to some uh shut up and rock audio  today shut up and rock the show that replaced us in syracuse yeah wow this gotta take off right 
[01:03:00]  and let it be known that we're getting nothing but syracuse phone calls once again today so i guess  you know what you're doing there for eight what's the stock price down to today uh stunt drop again  no it popped to 88 and then dropped back to 83 oh wow good day trading going on played it  we needed to play that mother effer yeah oh thank you i just got some change i could buy another share  of citadel stock my friends great uh 877-212-0-n-a opian anthony 877-212-0-n-a 
[01:03:30]  i ran to the bathroom what do you got there jimmy  what are we looking at really vile i watched videos this morning they actually disturbed me  you finally found your line as far as porn goes yeah like animal porn i find to be pretty  disgusting as well like obviously that's horrible stuff but this is just a couple and there's a very 
[01:04:00]  fine line like where a girl is just say let's just say pleasuring a guy making him feel good and  let's just say sometimes it will cause a girl to vomit right and uh and these are all that those  such videos where of that variety yeah yeah and there are a couple obviously there's a lot of  videos but she's into it like oh how could you be into that that one looks like pea soup what do 
[01:04:30]  they make her eat beforehand like pea soup yeah but uh something going on there but just the smell  has got to be so awful because he has vomit on his legs it's everywhere oh wow continuing wait  you see it fast motion though it's like this is in slow motion it's just disgusting i had i had to  shower after it oh it's so horrendous but i knew i'd get e-rock i didn't watch it first like baby food 
[01:05:00]  that came up terrible uh i was in the bathroom during the break and just a quickie we got all-star  weekend or all-star week here in new york city got the 18 block red carpet that's messing up  everybody's uh commute today and uh i was just kind of looking over the the uh the sports section  you know that barry bonds his agent is still trying to get him a team really you got the trade deadline  at the end of the month i believe right isn't it like july 31st something like that and there's 
[01:05:30]  no takers for barry bonds barry bonds wants to continue playing baseball and his agent has been  shopping him around and nobody wants to take barry bonds no one wants to take the chance of signing  him to a bunch of cash and then having him go to jail it's not even a bunch of cash  because uh they're even going as uh as low as just uh trying to get him a minimum contract  wow he wants to play he'll he wants to play so bad he basically wants to play for no money yes  the major league minimum uh is 390 000 right and i believe that's for the whole year you're talking 
[01:06:00]  about a half a year he basically wants to play for no money yeah because he has way more money than  that it's not about the money and uh the agents even say it if that doesn't raise a level of  suspicion i don't know what does why won't and then it says a pathetic ending to the story  wow the home run king nobody wants to pick up this year did they cut him they just said we don't need  his contract was done and they didn't want to resign him they they wanted to be done with barry bonds  and move on yeah that's all about though well it's uh you know uh what the steroid thing but i mean 
[01:06:30]  yeah so they're paranoid he's the home run king how could you not he's the home run king yeah you  think they're afraid that like without it he's gonna do terrible anyway like every team is probably  the guy's gonna hit he's not gonna do terrible though i mean maybe that's what they're afraid  of and that like at the very least it would help your box office so like yeah you got name  recognition there's one of these teams that isn't doing that well you pick up barry bonds you get a 
[01:07:00]  few extra people in the seat so and you sell there's a value there especially if you're going  to only pay about 390 000 you kidding me that's a great investment but with all the all the stuff  that's going on that no one wants to take the chance that's amazing to me you'd sell it merchandise  you'd make it oh my god jerseys of course you would so uh it's still a headline for us anyway but  we got replaced in syracuse i don't know what citadel was thinking because i mean our feedback 
[01:07:30]  has been ridiculous phone calls all morning from syracuse instant feedback from syracuse  emails from syracuse a lot of what the f is going on in syracuse and then we find out that uh they  replaced us with a show called shut up and rock that does shut up and rock that doesn't make us feel  too good if you're the uh host of shut up and rock your boss is really telling you that you suck  that's pretty much your boss is saying you suck so badly talking on the air yeah um that i'm gonna 
[01:08:00]  put a you on a show called shut up and rock yeah which means we'd want you to play the records and  shut up i just imagine like a meeting a month or two from now where she's feeling good about her show  and tries to talk to pd into letting her talk a little more now now now you see what it's called  yeah shut up and rock shut up and rock you're the shut up part see the records of the rock part  that's what he that's what your boss is telling you yeah hold on uh let's go to john in new york john 
[01:08:30]  what's up hey guys they're the thing with barry bond is they're all pretty sure he's going to jail  and none of them wants his name affiliated with their team they don't want to announce new york  yankees player barry bonds goes to jail so that no one wants to sign him until the whole court  goes through when do you think that uh the jail thing will be decided during the season  i have no clue they're going to just drag their feet like everything else i don't think it's going 
[01:09:00]  to be during the season sure they're going to want it to be after the season i like the uh  like the martha stewart thing it's for uh perjury it's not even for because you can't go to jail  for steroids yeah but he perjured himself apparently yeah lying about what he knew and what he did  well uh thank you there john eric on long island eric hey what's up guys hey uh yeah i just wanted  to throw in there the barry bonds trial is not starting till oh nine right and on top of that 
[01:09:30]  last year at bat for at bat he was by far still the best player in major league baseball yeah his  skills didn't diminish that much uh whatsoever that's what makes this very very strange that  no one would take a chance with him he must be a real ass i'm thinking he must not be a nice guy  and no one wants to be yeah not nice to hang out around yeah maybe they like seeing him suffer  maybe everybody's like like let him go yeah let him let him look stupid but it's weird how like  they're going after the players like for this like they're not calling are they making the owners 
[01:10:00]  testify are they are they are they putting the owners up for perjury charges it's like a bad position  to put players in how about the managers that knew what was going on in the locker room absolutely  and looking the other way as there's uh shenanigans going on in the stalls and  wherever like what player would throw his own legacy down the toilet i don't blame bonds for  lying like you have this legacy everybody is doing it and yours is going to get flushed down the  toilet when they're not calling everybody to testify to the same stuff everybody's not telling 
[01:10:30]  the truth and the owners aren't going to it's just irritating yeah absolutely all right uh so  moving back so we got some audio of uh shut up and rock this is what's going on on the shut up  and rock radio show today in syracuse the show that replaced us  it rocks it's on 95x shut up and rock mornings on today's 95x you got your tickets to see the  premiere of the latest batman movie the dark but she's talking i thought this was shut up and rock  a shut up and rock show should be just a computer voice yeah like uh no i'm serious steven hawking

[01:12:30]  them back just because you were stupid enough to bring it to the put it down the front of your  pants yeah they're not going to frisk you like that right medical uh metal detectors my friend  yeah i'll go through metal detector yes let's say hi to john in syracuse we could do these phone calls  all day john yeah what's up hey buddy oh it's awful turned on my radio yesterday morning and realized  holy crap it's gone yeah you know i guess uh i guess we didn't have listeners even though the phones  are just lit every day the last two days every single morning i listen so that's crap well you

[01:13:30]  we're too stupid to know uh this business well they've lost me multiple times and that's probably  gonna be the last time all right john thank you no problem you know if they replaced us with some  like uh rush limbaugh because they decided to go political anything with uh but shut up it's just a  money saving thing i bet you that's it they just want to save they're probably paying or nothing  of course they're paying or nothing the same thing they were paying guess what  they got us on the cheap my friend i could easily certainly did they're not paying her that much 
[01:14:00]  less let's just put it that way unless she was uh you know on welfare woman arrested in sex  competition my friends sex competition yes athens athens greece or georgia uh greece my friend  okay listen to this a woman okay that's different i think we need to bring this to our radio show 
[01:14:30]  and then we'll show really shut up and rock people yeah shut up and suck  that's what citadel was basically telling us there jimmy  nine british women were facing prostitution charges charges after being arrested at the  at the weekend for taking at the weekend at the weekend all right for taking part in a  oral sex competition wow in the greek holiday island of 
[01:15:00]  zach zach zachynos wasn't lesbos or whatever that place was i'm proud to be a lesbian a lesbian  from a lesbos we have that clip of the old dude proud to be a lesbian yeah we got to play that today  yeah so you got this greek holiday island uh zach zachynos or something like that  you got six british and six uh greek men including two bar owners were also charged in the incident  which took place at uh this beach in the south of the ionian island which lies off the west coast of 
[01:15:30]  mainland greece okay the women who came to the popular resort on holiday have been paid to take  part in the competition an oral sex competition which was video recorded and was to be posted on the  internet this is obviously uh tna for ona which we did live on the beach  is greece ripping us off this sounds exactly well we didn't like what we did in buffalo we didn't 
[01:16:00]  have buffalo we didn't have an official competition well let me tell you they decided to take it upon  themselves to compete i know i have never seen what i saw in such large numbers we made it easy for  the lawyers because this is what we love about tna with ona uh back in the day in buffalo i mean they  still talk about this in buffalo we were supposed to be fired for tna with ona even though it was never 
[01:16:30]  on the radio the debauchery that happened on that beach yep outside of buffalo southwest of buffalo  on that fine saturday was just unbelievable the videos are still all over the internet it was supposed  to be an innocent game of volleyball and it basically turned out to be a lesbian orgy in  the sand yeah and then girls were having a competition with uh with vegetable products  and not small ones no no baby carrots no no yeah yeah and it was just so widespread all over the beach 
[01:17:00]  and there was um it got really bad because well we didn't if we knew this was going to happen we'd  have cordoned off the beach a little bit yeah but uh we didn't know it was a spontaneous thing  these girls just decided to take it upon themselves and go ah we're just gonna go from playing a little  topless volleyball which was what it was supposed to be it wasn't even supposed to be topless volleyball 
[01:17:30]  no it was just supposed to be stripper volleyball you're right you know where they would wear tiny  little bikinis yeah well it turned into topless volleyball and then it turned into uh topless and  bottle a completely nude volleyball with these girls then they forgot about volleyball and just  started laying down in the sand and and things i saw that day stay in my mind absolutely till this day  absolutely and the the horror of the whole thing and the biggest problem wasn't so much that 
[01:18:00]  it was that it was a public beach and there were families on blankets with coolers just trying to  have some fun you know what they didn't see anything did they there were so many people crowding  that's true they were crowded around it did look like some kind of a um yeah uh well uh for a lack  of a better term a gang rape yeah it was just everybody uh gathered around so it was very hard to see  from any distance and who signed off on tna with ona ah the old days the same dopey lawyers 
[01:18:30]  i believe so that said that our uh listeners could run around the city and have sex i believe  public places and then uh oh they were coming for us oh yeah they were the media was swirling  the lawyers and the police by the way the police for us there were uh depositions that were going to  be done yeah next thing you know we did the sex for sam thing and then it was uh very very easy to  to make everything go away yeah where can we find some of those old videos they're up there still right 
[01:19:00]  here and there so anyway they did this oral sex competition in uh on this greek island uh  that's all they have to say about it so it was supposed to be posted on the internet the men were  charged with encouraging obscene behavior see we would have been arrested for that ourselves back  today anthony uh let's see around 15 million people a fifth of them british visit the eastern 
[01:19:30]  mediterranean country each year drawn by its soaring summer temperatures azure waters and sandy beaches so  so they had a nice uh oral sex competition that's that's wonderful here's uh one of our favorite clips  i am proud to be a lesbian i am proud to be a lesbian that's from lesbos right is that the name of the  place yes i am from lesbos yes i am proud to be a lesbian the island of lesbos we have seth green

[01:21:00]  go to their all-star game it's part of the make a wish foundation uh thing they gave me the second  one was to sit here stare at you uh do you realize jill brought up uh last night that um it'll be a year  since we met on jimmy's birthday she came by last birthday that jimmy had oh no kidding that was  when she actually came in the studio with uh the cake and everything and the sparks weren't flying 
[01:21:30]  obviously because you had to wait another yeah i think something was uh in the way like two  relationships she had an email two well i was in one and she was oh i got emails from her i remember  jill nicolini emailed me about coming on the show and you guys didn't believe that she had  actually emailed of course not she probably had a thing for you back then even uh and see there's  a picture of me all nervous i make fun of that picture i'm just standing there like hi 
[01:22:00]  well now uh you're up to know who's keeping track stunt brain stunt brain of course how many days  stunt brain look he'll he'll have the answer i believe yesterday was 63 so wow 64 today yeah  we're at 64 days yeah and counting a little over two months going strong in oh yeah we don't talk  about uh the anthelini thing as much no we're you know we're uh hanging out i understand all right 
[01:22:30]  here's uh some audio i'm a country star uh i wear a big uh hat on my head when i'm not wearing a  yankee cap look at him you're god damn jimmy hit right on the head of progeria kid he's awful  well maury why can't uh why can't we get a cool cap let me tell you something i'm a mets fan  yeah the yankee uh baseball cap very cool to wear and i and i have to say the red sox cap very cool 
[01:23:00]  i hate the red sox but it is a cool cap to wear i uh you're a fan i bought a uh mets cap this summer  i can't for your chick no yeah i might as yes that's exactly the point why can't they figure  out a cool cap for guys if you're a mets fan you don't that you just don't see many guys walking  around with uh mets caps uh-huh which one did you get though yeah i tried to go with the pink one  the visor yeah that's right dude oh good i haven't done that in a while uh you know they 
[01:23:30]  they attempt to fade out that awful blue yeah the blue blue is one of the coolest colors ever  not not not if you're in the mets organization they decide to get the the worst version of the  color blue and say this will work i like when i i was wearing a mess hat for a while until my hair  outgrew it but uh you gotta go with them you gotta go with the black like the black cap with  i tried those two it's just not as cool as the yankee hat the red sox hat just about every other 
[01:24:00]  cap out there is cool you you should see what the the phillies are doing they got some great merch  they have a big p on their hat  it doesn't even sound right  the mets merch just sucks they're gonna they're gonna have a new stadium next year they should just  like they should not even tell the league just come up with brand new colors and go look we we  know you know it's time to move on to something new really does stink because i did go to the the 
[01:24:30]  last subway series in new york yes they didn't even have any any like cool stuff to buy to like  commemorate the big event that it was i walked out of there with one of those crappy pennants yeah for  like oh it's like they didn't have a shirt or a stick no i didn't i didn't i didn't take the stick  the islander merch is awful too it just sucks just uh representing the hockey fans out there  why is that we lost ted nolan and uh not happy about it seems like the easiest thing to do would  be come up with some kind of merchandise they got the wrong guys in the organization that uh don't 
[01:25:00]  get what people want i guess you know what else uh something something uh gets put on a hat or a  jersey and for years and it just sticks and people don't want to change remember when  the islanders wanted to change and they went to that gorton's a gloucester fisherman look  yeah that stunk completely ridiculous the jets went went for their um that different jets logo  where it said the jets and kind of that weird 80s not weird 80s logo thing they're making it look 
[01:25:30]  like a jet were they i think so yeah i i just remember like the the lettering was kind of tilted  a little like um like if a jet was able to write that's how it would write jets yeah is that it  and then people said no we want the classic you know yeah yeah people get hung up on it so i don't  think the mets logo you're not gonna be able to change that by the way scott from hop hog i know  where the mets got their colors from the brooklyn dodgers is the blue and and the uh the giants 
[01:26:00]  you know is the orange great when both teams used to play in new york i know that well it doesn't  right the metropolitans it's a terrible name it's horrid yes the knickerbockers and the  metropolitans the knickerbockers who are your favorite sports clubs yeah well ted who's it  yours i prefer the metropolitans the knickerbockers the knickerbockers what the hell is a knickerbocker  is that a beer no the knickerbockers we have the is that underpants huh knickers yeah knickers dude 
[01:26:30]  we who i'll let you do them at home dude we have the worst names for for for sports franchises in  new york yep metropolitans uh jets uh jets i see jets calm jets and then the knickerbockers which  what was it uh is a dutch surname and a type of clothing loose fitting trousers that's wonderful  oh name your basketball team after after loose fitting trousers yeah that's wonderful 
[01:27:00]  i so loose i'm sorry to me i'm doing your best that's okay you can like the knickerbockers as  well i prefer the metropolitans but in the american league i like the athletics  that is a dumb one athletics they're athletic but it's plural  it's more of a more of an adjective yeah that's a dumb one too you're right i guess most of them are  stupid yeah there are any other adjectives yeah the rangers the yankees they're all nouns 
[01:27:30]  yeah why would you yes how about the fasts  supersonics yeah yeah they're supersonic that's all right though i mean the new jersey nets  might as well call them the new jersey balls it's just like it's the most basic thing you could call a  team yeah what should we call them and then they look at the basketball hoop well let's call them the  nets stupid that's a terrible name what was the second choice um i don't like mints the new jersey 
[01:28:00]  urinal mints and they decided on nets two choices it's a very rare hat it's a hat with like a little  puck mint i don't i don't like when uh another sports team takes the name of a team that's already  there in another sport like the rangers like what was first the baseball team or the hockey team i would  have to say the hockey probably the hockey team then why the hell would the baseball team go  we're the rangers they move i know it's the texas rangers yeah it's supposed to be like because 
[01:28:30]  texas rangers st louis and arizona yeah what the come on giants the giants i know this is one of  those dumb sports trivia questions you hear on sports well we're gonna be talking about that all  they're making a man dog show sports teams that have the sports teams i don't understand it's  beyond me why they would pick the same name they're like how many are there there's like eight or  something i don't know or how about like when a team moves and they have to keep it so it's like 
[01:29:00]  the utah jazz when yeah yeah yeah when it has nothing to do with it the jazz made sense when they  were playing in new orleans yeah or the lakers it's not a lake in la not at all that was because  of minnesota of course when they used to be the minnesota lakers in minneapolis or minnesota  minneapolis i don't know minneapolis you're right jimmy yeah but with the jazz yeah that is just  just dumb yeah it should be like the the utah polygamists oh yes the utah pedophiles 
[01:29:30]  you brought up the athletics i don't know if stunt brain knows but like their original logo was an  elephant yeah why you know why yes yeah well yeah no do you know i don't know because elephants are  very athletic for fat creatures why don't you do a little wikipedia before you come on the air i'm  sorry exactly figured stunt brain knew oh are you taking a shot at stunt brain travis we did learn  last night that elephants can swim as far as two miles out to sea you went you went no way yeah why did 
[01:30:00]  i see you last night i don't know i was talking about mickey gervais well yeah yeah oh all right  we're just babbling now we got uh seth green yes ready to come on our fine radio show yeah he's here  jimmy so we're gonna take a quick break we're gonna get seth on and then we're gonna hopefully  get to this audio of an ex-boyfriend breaking into a house to torture a puppy in a revenge attack  oh boy what'd she do all coming on the opian anthony show you're checking out the opian anthony show  in studio seth green and he was just telling us that uh he went and saw the batman movie last night 
[01:30:30]  it's true i had like a super uh rock star plane getting into a car throwing my bag down changing  my t-shirt and literally running to the uh to the movie and i made it just when the press line was  closing down and nobody cared anymore and i just walked past through and i was like hi guys and  well let me get a picture and i was like gotta go gotta go and they didn't care because they're seth  green i mean if we try to do that that whole the the press area just shut down and we just  walked in i think we'd be on the side we get chased out a lot you guys get chased a lot we 
[01:31:00]  get chased out of places a lot like yeah we should be able to go to this thing we should  no we can't this is what i just meant i didn't have to take any pictures we've been at this for  uh well we've been doing the radio show together and i for 14 years jimmy's been with us for about  eight at this point and we we've almost made it in showbiz we're we're the almost made it guys  almost made it well like you went to the premiere of batman we're going tonight the day after the  premiere of batman it'll be the same movie before everyone else gets to see the same movie 
[01:31:30]  yeah they change it all around yeah they make it stop version for the premiere but the point is we  would have loved to gone to the premiere and see some big stars and stuff you know i didn't see  anybody man i really i walked into the screening and then i bolted right after yeah but you know  what we get we get this not no no that bad that that badge doesn't get you here yeah you have to go  yeah yeah that's i get that at the concerts all the time yeah you can you can watch the show but  you can't go backstage our best moment ever we haven't told this in a while when anthony and i 
[01:32:00]  first started working together they fly us out to la for the quote the oscars where it turned out to  be you know a hacky thing the comedy store was doing where we're just talking to like literally c-list  celebrities literally who was the biggest get that day marcia brady i think uh i don't think that's a  real person right yeah i know yeah i think she was the big one right if see i know the real names  or barry williams or barry one of the other but that was it was a brady so then they but it was  under the guys were going out there for the oscars but now we're at the comedy store and we weren't 
[01:32:30]  even good enough to be broadcasting inside the comedy store we were on the sidewalk whatever so  after the oscars we're like we're gonna go to spago and check out the slurries coming and going  that's where everyone went that's where they go right and then on monday we'll have some good  stories to tell right they had the bleachers set up and uh for the people watching anthony and i  got the bright idea we'll jump on the back of the bleachers and kind of hang from the top of the  bleachers we're not really gonna go over on this this like piece of wood please tell me you guys 
[01:33:00]  collapsed the bleachers i wish we didn't even get a chance because they said we weren't allowed to  do that we weren't even allowed to get down from there get down from the bleachers you're not allowed  up on the bleachers get down you too you too yes right there down off the bleachers so we walked  back okay who are those bleachers for if not people well it's for people but we were behind  because you had to have a ticket to just be in the bleachers so we decide we'll climb up the back and  we're kind of holding on from the back and we're standing on this this wood we're like this is cool  we'll check it out still cool though because we found a piece of wood that was a little high up 
[01:33:30]  that we could stand on yeah a piece of wood you know life is consistently a series of  emasculating humility exactly we stand on how you handle them that defines your grace and character  and and i'm not lying about this either we stand on the wood  get off the wood step off the wood you're not lying on the wood get off the wood step off you too  you too not lying on the wood get off the wood are you talking to us like what we get and then i tell i  i turn opi i go did we just get kicked off a piece of wood that we can't even stand on a piece 
[01:34:00]  of goddamn wood this was la though right and we're feeling yeah they're jerks we're feeling we're  feeling good about ourselves because they flew us out to la for quote the oscars oh you know we're  just walking back to the high it all bummed out like to watch it with the rest of the scummy djs in  the tv room yeah yeah that was the year i think that's a heartbreaking story to bring up the morning  drive that was that was the year letterman was hosting so but uh before we move on how was the  movie the movie's great yeah i love batman i've been excited to see this movie for two years it's 
[01:34:30]  fantastic i'm so glad they just redid the whole franchise i i like the cartoony versions they were  doing but now this dark this dark angle is just christian bale is terrific i i don't i haven't seen  anything he's been bad in that guy yeah i mean he's i was i was gonna say like swing kids but that's a  lie he's great in it yeah that's like one of his first yeah well no that one when he was a little  kid empire of the sun empire of the sun what was that bizarre movie you turned me on to the machinist 
[01:35:00]  oh yeah oh wow even american psycho like he's a great i love american psycho but this movie's so  well crafted i'm trying to listen to my new robert palmer tape hey can't help but notice that you got  the bone card the font is a raised gold color you're so upset with that you like huey lewis in  the news i want to talk about heath ledger get an oscar nomination i mean are they just look obviously  very young that he died are they saying that because he's a guy who died listen he's a he's 
[01:35:30]  a tremendous actor and everyone knows it and i think people are grieving and really don't know what  to do with that grief you know and and in in lieu of being able to hug michelle williams and tell her  everything's going to be okay i think that people need to celebrate him you know and it may get it may  get a little exaggerated it may completely be warranted but you know you got to understand that  when people lose somebody like that the culture just doesn't know what to do with it so they start  trying to figure out how to resolve it you know yeah it makes sense oscars is one thing to suggest 
[01:36:00]  is his uh performance good yeah he's he's mind-blowing man of course he is he's a phenomenal  actor no one would ever have debated that when everybody heard he was cast in this part it was  so exciting because you couldn't wait to see what he did with it and he did exactly what you'd hope  that he that he'd do with it is it like uh because sometimes you get taken aback it looks a little  weird at first like you're like oh it's the guy he's not alive anymore i didn't find that for  myself at least you know but i'm sure there'll be a lot of that around it yeah absolutely yeah you get 
[01:36:30]  over it fast though you're good then you get into the movie but at first i know when somebody dies  during the filming of a movie or something you're kind of like kind of distract you a little from  the movie it could i i mean i didn't i didn't let it distract me and it'd be it'd be cool if people  didn't either was he better than nicholson because that was that that's how you compare i mean you know  but but it's it's not even following nicholson it's it's the joker it's like james bond you know  there's millions of people will play him over time and it's it's who does it intelligently 
[01:37:00]  he did something completely different with uh the character why is everybody screaming at me  does batman get the bad guy at the end of the movie well that's that's uh debatable isn't it  that's it speaking of james bond thing i loved how they did that too like i like how they're  reinventing these characters casino royale i've watched it probably five times uh on t on cable and  stuff it's fantastic yeah the way they just reinvented everything he's a true badass in it it's just  people's tastes have changed and moviegoers allowances in their movies have changed what 
[01:37:30]  people are willing to see what they want to see that's why movies like pineapple express and super  bad get so popular because yeah because people's tastes have changed somewhat so yeah movies to  cater to that like i i don't know you watch some of the old james bonds and uh you know they got so  hokey now i mean to us now with a you know 2000s perspective but at the time they were at the time  it was yeah they were great you know you'd watch it and video in hindsight you look back and go  which one yeah but that's like trying to compare a prius to a steam engine car i mean 
[01:38:00]  yeah it's you just evolve at the time definitely are you into the prius i have a prius yeah  uh i have a prius too no steve steve has the well i drive in los angeles man you drive everywhere  gas is almost five dollars now and i just it's insane and i'm on the road too much to drive something  that i can't i i am of the school of i'd rather do something drastic and not have to sacrifice my  comfort well i still i have a i have a mercedes that i drive sometimes on the weekends so okay 
[01:38:30]  so i can i can be an aero that way i have a an escalade and um a shelby  so i mean i am sucking down the gas wow anthony uh if you got if you got the income for it uh well  you know something for a hundred bucks every time you have to fill up it's it's ludicrous now  but i'd rather just attack venezuela i was saying this yesterday let's just attack venezuela  and live in the creature comforts we're accustomed to let's not at all try and solve this problem 
[01:39:00]  just like a quick fix that's like sending off that trash barge you remember that like 20  yeah yeah it went on tour it became like famous people kind of wanted to see it in their town  they just didn't want to keep it there they didn't know what to do with that damn thing  but uh anthony doesn't think the prius looks cool enough though there it doesn't no i wait  oh you're gonna admit that yeah of course that's the first thinking that's a beautiful design i mean  shouldn't they at least try and get a better body and the car needs to make noises so it doesn't run 
[01:39:30]  over people because they're not actually that's what they're not aware of interesting is that no one  hears you coming silent like i'll be in i'll be in parking garages you know how people just love to  walk directly in front of your car they really can't hear it i'm about four inches away from them  before i give them a little meep meep the little roadrunner sound that it makes but it does freak  them out because you're inches away from them before they have any idea that you're close you  know it sucks is like uh kids growing up now won't know the pleasure of rolling your parents car out 
[01:40:00]  the driveway in neutral and down the block before you have to start it up to steal their car at night  you could just you know leave in the prius and uh it'll be all quiet yeah but on a sadder note kids will  never understand the pleasure of sliding a vinyl out of its sleeve for the first time and reading  the liner notes on a new record vinyls make it a comeback though a little bit they keep saying  that year after year and you know something there will always be there's always going to be vinyl  purists but even the djs have converted to digital yeah they're all digital now every time you just see  that lit up little apple up there dj's got yeah but you can get a million songs it's amazing 
[01:40:30]  they used to go with crates of records man crates and now i was down in atlantis about a month ago  and uh they were changing djs out like in two seconds one guy comes it's like it was like that  that well uh like the cartoon with the wolf and the sheepdog right they're just one punches in one  punches out he grabs the uh his computer the other guy sets up his uh his mac plugs in and there he is 
[01:41:00]  that's it they got they got a couple of turntables with those digital um vinyl on it that just it's  good for whatever programming has in there that's the program where you can it's amazing you can mix  from table to table but it's still on on your computer it's just plenty of things i hate about  the brave new world but as far as the digital music and and it's uh um like travelability i absolutely  love the future you look into uh like like each decade and what it brought and you can't really tell  without a little hindsight like during the 70s you didn't know the 70s was going to be 
[01:41:30]  the goofy 70s the disco thing the whole it's just what it was yeah but then not until the 80s did you  look back and go wow that was kind of silly and then you walk around in the 80s with the funny hair  and the shoulder pads and the chinese writing on your shirt and zipper pants and then you look back  at that in the 90s and go that was stupid and then you got grunge well to the the thousands i think  is going to be defined by just leaps and bounds in technology and what we carried around and and  it could be cultural implosion i mean uh end of an empire whatever whatever we don't know that's 
[01:42:00]  just it we won't know until uh you know the next 10 years that's a big jump though well i like the  fact we have digital music well america's probably gonna fall be overtaken by islam well one of the  other i wasn't even gonna get that specific one of the other earthquakes all over the world i'm downloading  apps that's all i know new apps for my iphone when said when seth arrived today is it true that steve  was making believe he was a ballerina when you walked into the office or something gosh i wasn't 
[01:42:30]  even gonna out him like that but there was something i believe he's way out it was uh some kind of new  aerobics that has to do with ballet i don't know here he is what happened to get on here and defend  yourself well because everyone ran in and they said there was a weird moment seth walked into the  office and and steve was going i'm a ballerina i didn't think it was that weird but i'm a ballerina  it's haunting him what did you say steve we didn't i said i'm a ballerina and i said why don't you get  those tights off and do your job exactly i'd like to thank sam for being the instigator that he is  not sam not our dear sweet sam because the only person in here with a mouth that big that witnessed 
[01:43:00]  the in the incident was you i know i said it i'm just saying why would you say i'm a ballerina because  uh sam's lovely girlfriend it uh came up to uh watch the show and she brought uh munchkins and  she said steve would you like a munchkin and i said no i'm a ballerina in training i'm watching  my figure see i didn't even get the context oh so in my imagination you had both of your hands on  your head and were doing a pirouette yeah i was i was i started to do a pirouette and as i got halfway 
[01:43:30]  through a pirouette i saw seth green standing there i was like oh boy you want to be feminine so bad  no i really don't you really do you get a pirouette you know little girly not with that  mustache what had to be a little girl you just you just made it look like i threw it like a throwaway  yeah i said i was a ballerina like you were a dock worker joking around sunny list  i literally was in the middle of the kind of reference of the student i think i went i think  i had like one hand on my head and i went i'm a ballerina and i turned i got like that i got like 
[01:44:00]  halfway through i'm a ballerina and i saw seth and i went oh boy  you weren't you weren't halfway at all you were pretty committed yeah was that can you redo it  like without seriously like yeah yeah let's see the whole thing where's the munchkins greedy staff  i want a munchkin don't have a munchkin you're in training wow that was the let's get the full  quickest here we go okay so somebody asked me if i'd like a munchkin what do you like would you like  a munchkin no thank you i'm watching my figure i'm a ballerina yeah he wants to be a girl yeah 
[01:44:30]  there's a certain like joyful elation yeah and there you you ooze femininity even though you're  you're like a big guy there's a contented satisfaction look  we'll prove the difference kenny can you do the same line oh god just just for look like steve  looked very very feminine as you just noticed you guys have a stripper pole in the corner yeah  we're not allowed to use it they gave it to us and then said by the way uh you can't have 
[01:45:00]  girls do she radio well not girls but maybe no we have guys we've done that we have done that  for some reason it's fine to have naked guys in the studio yeah who's running this joint all right  go ahead uh someone ask kenny if you would like hey kenny do you want some munchkins no thank you  i'm a ballerina you big monster see the difference yes kenny looks stupid but wants to be pretty  god damn herman monster i'll tell you because kenny got up kenny got up i watched kenny's feet 
[01:45:30]  he got up on the balls of his feet because he wanted to seem sweet yeah i know how to be a ballerina  yeah yeah yeah i was on my tippy toes yeah all right hey uh unbelievable seth we had your old  uh pal in studio a couple weeks ago mike myers oh how is he uh great we had a great time with him  and uh he's so funny it was brought up that uh our pal colin quinn was supposed to be well let me let  me start right off with saying i love colin quinn and have loved him for a long time i'm just saying 
[01:46:00]  i watched him do stand-up i watched him on short attention span back when it was on and  you know colin i like colin but i really i'm glad i got that part yeah why did what happened  with colin and and uh it was about because colin wants to work on colin does our show a lot so i  think but they also they weren't sure what they were going to do with that character whether they  wanted to be an adult whether they wanted to look like a teenager like what was going to sell that  joke better and when i came in to read for it everybody in town had read for it and the only  advantage i had was that i hadn't been available when they were doing the general casting so that makes 
[01:46:30]  you seem really desirable they're like well we've seen everyone except this seth green character  like why can't i see him well he's working right working on what let's let's let's pay him out of  that job and get him on that like the competitiveness of it yeah really takes over so that worked to my  advantage colin will deny this but he is a self-hating idiot wait a minute a stand-up comic with a  self-loathing streak that doesn't even make sense very rare quality normally very healthy emotional  people have no vices yeah colin uh he said he was doing his own thing and he didn't you know 
[01:47:00]  want to do the project he's probably asleep now colin had one of my favorite you know the news on  snl has changed hands so many times and when colin took over his opening speech was so funny he goes  i know i'm not as good as dennis miller i know i'm not the guy everybody's excited about seeing  you know sometimes you walk into a bar and the bartender who's been serving you drinks for 35 years  isn't there anymore i'm your new bartender oh that's a really good guy  he was great i'm gonna serve the same drinks but you know it's a different guy 
[01:47:30]  he does colin's lips that's hysterical i actually like it was like it was the smoothest transition it  was a great way of saying look this is what happened i'm this guy you're not gonna leave the  bar you're still gonna sit down and have a drink you still like drinking i'm still gonna give you the  drink so that's perfect oh damn you can be the colin that i want you to be you can be the positive  friendly encouraging colin good to see you hey i really like that black savage shirt not the 
[01:48:00]  miserable colin we know he's awful oh every time we talk about him he comes running in here because  he lives very close he gets all mad i haven't seen him in his pajamas yeah i've been seeing him  almost every day is he doing all right yeah yeah he's fine he's good working on a project right  now he's doing good we should take a break we got a dial dundee four yeah i know norton  we got seth green uh when we get back we'll talk about robot chicken the star wars thing got a 
[01:48:30]  nice little buzz on it let's do it uh you got uh season two of uh robot chicken i've been checking  that out love it i'm a huge fan of robot chicken i was waiting for the opinion thank you huge fan and  you got seth green online uh dot com so we'll continue well opie and anthony  we're hanging with seth green today on the opie and anthony show got a bunch of things going on i'm  going through robot chicken season two on dvd season three maybe by the end of the year i think so  but the star wars dvd is coming out uh july 22nd and that's the thing that everybody can pick up right 
[01:49:00]  now i just got a copy yesterday and i uh should have watched it before you came in uh well it's  that's why they give it give it to us early so we're well prepared when seth green actually comes  on the program but it so you can tell me to my face how you liked it or didn't like it no it's  getting great reviews right well oh good um yeah people are well i don't know if it's reviews but  the buzz is really good we did we did really well people were people were very responsible when we 
[01:49:30]  first put it out which is exciting because you know we got it's exciting that we get to make this  show uh but that we get to make star wars is even crazier yeah so i'm i'm happy that people are into  it too because it was kind of a a wonderful personal experience yeah it's nice that people are sharing  it with me if that makes any sense now uh what did you do with this star wars thing um it was  it's a half hour of our show but dedicated exclusively to star wars so typically we do sketches you know  about pop culture uh current events that thing that type of thing and this is all about star wars so 
[01:50:00]  just pointing out inherent silliness or ironies yeah everybody's got a few uh star wars things  in their uh we basically just filmed all the geek conversations we've been having for the last 25  years yeah that's all you need to do pretty much we've been uh we've been uh actually kind of hooked a  little on not way not way i know where you're going it's me travis um danny uh what else is 
[01:50:30]  involved in the sam uh kind of hooked on back to the future oh god what now only recently we're just  well no believe me wait a minute many years are you telling me that you built a time machine  out of the delorean see see that's one of the greatest movies ever i know and we watch it all  the time you can even go into the sequels the second one's yeah the third one's really cool  too it's just at the time no one was ready for old west it's a little it was a little weird the  old west thing watch it now it's still awesome we yeah we we goof on it a lot you know the parts 
[01:51:00]  that you goof on nike's making those sneakers i know that well that brought the whole thing up  the nike mcfly we know the mcfly 2015 don't you remember when zemeckis was talking about the  technology for the hoverboard and how parent groups wouldn't allow it out but he'd gotten his  hands on it for the movie yeah and how they built it was all these lies that he's told trying to  preserve the special effects nothing saying that uh he that the uh delorean had been fit with a  helicopter blade underneath it so it would hover in the alleyway no way they were lowering it on 
[01:51:30]  piano wire no no yeah trying to keep the myth going it was awesome we uh there it is the  mcfly uh 2015 yeah which coming up on you know 2015 won't be all that far away i think they have  a lot of things that they have to look all that outrageous now do they self-tighten yeah i know  they have to self-tighten and then you need the self-drying jacket too that goes with it you ever  try and wear a rubber jacket why is that it's cool in the future why is danny being shy usually when 
[01:52:00]  this back to the future thing happens then they all like fight for mic time to try to get their i was  just enjoying it i just uh i don't enjoy how the hoverboard won't go over water uh will it under  any circumstances or unless you got power hey did you guys know that they were originally gonna call  the hoverboard the mad dog as uh as a foreshadow to uh to mad dog tannin yes they changed that to 
[01:52:30]  the pitbull the last one of course buford mad dog tannin he's uh you know the great great great  grandfather of biff tannin who in that alternate dimension uh or alternate uh timeline wow was he  something the hotel the casino he interns for this radio program under the name green pie joe  now biff don't con me look at jimmy's face i actually watched part two recently yeah just so 
[01:53:00]  he could be part of this no don't be part of this this geeky thing they do couldn't sleep because of  my sinuses so i was watching and it was actually very believable the way he was in the back seat  and talking on a walkie-talkie and biff didn't hear him and i'm like that's what i liked about this  yeah it was a little loud yeah uh in the back seat doc doc and biff hears nothing you know i love  that you're questioning the reality of a movie where where doc brown buys plutonium from libyans  in a vw van my my favorite thing with the whole with the whole series all the movies and everything 
[01:53:30]  though is the fact that uh when uh marty gets back home after the whole thing and everyone's a little  different right and biff is waxing the car and uh the parents come in you know and um they're they're  kind of they're cool with the fact that biff and tried to rape yeah tried to rape marty's mom  sure in the car they were kids and and he's like well you know we wouldn't have met if it wasn't for  biff yeah biff trying to rape you and then uh getting punched in the face nobody ever really 
[01:54:00]  worries about that the discretions of teenagers you know and only back then could a comedy  um have the word uh or the line uh what was that one get get out of here get out of here you spook  oh i don't well you said it not me well that's it's part of the movie it's a goddamn michael j fox movie  yeah it's actually yeah that's right way to bring the room down yeah no i'm kidding you know why 
[01:54:30]  because the censors uh they they bleep us out when we say certain things oh yeah me too yeah i know i'm  just quoting a movie but you know they wouldn't have that in a movie now exactly as a joke probably  probably not probably not you guys all the time whenever the mics go off you're quoting roots  well do you know only the first part that disney was approached with the script and turned it down  because the material was too racy a little racy a disney film really saw yeah mother falling in love 
[01:55:00]  with her son that incestuous scene where they're kissing in the car yeah it's very risky for disney  that was before they uh bought miramax yeah that's a real interesting fact there isn't it yeah  terrific i thought so you know we just can't get enough of back to the future yes we can  can i go to uh back to the future and play something please if you want to be cool up you  could call it bttf that's true yeah i guess i'm not cool like you i like that second abbreviation 
[01:55:30]  the same it actually it actually is exactly an abbreviation yeah  let me uh go back to the future and play a little something something what's better than hitting the  mall oh jesus oh my god so yes i did this commercial and i was like why are you talking over it well  because it's been it's been on youtube for three years now three years yeah we haven't been able  to play it in front of you though back in 1992 has it been that long since i've seen you guys 
[01:56:00]  back in 1992 you did a fine little commercial for the nerf football well the sad reality of acting  all your life wow he doesn't want us to play this you can play it all you want i just i just  desperately want to promote the robot chicken star wars dvd which is going to be available in stores  july 22nd yeah hey look but aside from that you can talk about nerf all you want you are because  it's nerf or nothing is that the catchphrase oh that is the catchphrase you know this is really  embarrassing because this commercial never aired uh because because when you when you get right down 
[01:56:30]  to it it's two kids shooting strangers in a mall jesus like with a slingshot just attacking girls and  mimes and public servants and i think the client when they saw it they were like we really don't  want to encourage kids to go to do that strangers so they reshot the entire thing without me  and then uh and then like a in like a backyard in uh torrance and then they buried this thing and  then how did it see the light of day i have no idea you know people have copies everything stuff  on the internet well on youtube that's why you can't make a sex tape or do anything embarrassing 
[01:57:00]  unless you're okay with the world seeing it and in most cases when people make sex tapes they really  are just waiting for the world to see it yeah yeah i i completely agree with that um what what's fun  about this is we go and play our old taste from time to time on our show oh it's horrid and we  and we sweat and we get really uncomfortable we can't get through it it's so awkward yeah well  you know i've got my entire life's work on the internet so at this point every embarrassing  hairstyle or clothing choice i've made is available for me yeah but your average is way up there my 
[01:57:30]  friend can we play this or you don't want i don't yeah play it all you want play it all you want  and buy the robot all you want that means that's different it's like you know you play play it all  you want well i don't care who me care yeah that's right up there with go ahead  play it all you want it is pretty that hairdo is pretty that is something you're sporting like  you're rocking man what that is that's rocking for 92 though it was the uh jason newstead  oh okay yes right robot chicken star wars on dvd it's true july 22nd let's see if we can get 
[01:58:00]  through this without him talking what's better than hitting the mall hitting it with a nerf fling  shot allow us to demonstrate proper usage whilst you frolic locate let's shoot these young girls  on the escalator we can hit on them long distance we gotta love it like we love mine  definitely not a nacho let's shoot this stranger into the public fountain yeah this is a little 
[01:58:30]  violent this uh commercial this is why i think it never aired oh my god but the best thing is that i  had a long conversation with the client who really thought that that kind of new york accent thing was  what they wanted they kept telling me yeah you're joe bag of donuts hey oh god that's you oh you  you're not for nothing oh joe bag of donuts i was like i'm gonna do this but i think it's stupid  and then uh now it's now it's haunting me because none of the clients are on the internet the best  part of that commercial is the ball is going towards the girl's face it's like they don't 
[01:59:00]  even shoot her in the chest right in the face right in the face that's nice great yeah and then i like  your take on the whole leave britney alone that uh was all over you too oh my gosh i couldn't even  believe that that uh had such a life i went and did that for the soup you know that show the soup  we had joel mikhail in what yesterday oh yeah oh joel's awesome so i went and did that bit and  then it got i went viral next thing you know everybody's telling me they're like britney  spears i didn't even know what had happened really i just did this bit for the soup and then like a 
[01:59:30]  day later it's all over the internet yeah it's very funny so it goes let's go to tom in new york  tom we're uh hanging with seth green today hey what's going on man what's up uh nothing i had a  question about um like if you had uh the option to go back and uh play uh james st james again  would you still do that with uh all your success now um yeah man yeah i was really uh attracted to  that role just because i i i related to that time and i kind of thought that was an important story 
[02:00:00]  to tell like a like a really dark cautionary tale and i thought james is a pretty exceptionally  talented writer um and i was excited to get the opportunity to tell that story so that's awesome  and because you know it's a hard part to play you know you and macaulay culkin and uh what it  entailed yeah it was a it was a it was a brutal job man i'm glad you saw it thank you yeah you did a  great job man uh keep up the good work bro thank you very much one of my favorite things party  monster yeah all right thank you tom i have a question for uh for seth have you heard anything 
[02:00:30]  about uh buffy the vampire slayer being made into a movie um you know i just did this uh thing at the  the museum of television radio uh and a bunch of the cast was there sarah and and joss whedon and uh  and and nick and chrisman everybody and uh somebody mentioned the idea of a movie and you know we all  offhandedly said that if there was something worth doing joss included that we'd do it but i haven't  heard anything that's pretty interesting has that been done before a movie that was made into a series  uh into a movie you know the closest thing is probably the producers like the movie that was 
[02:01:00]  made into a musical made into a movie about the musical yeah true okay buffy was a movie first i  didn't even know that oh yeah there's a movie with uh christy swanson luke perry donald sutherland's in  it as a matter of fact oh how great was he you want to know the funniest secret i'm in that movie too  no way well technically i'm cut out but i'm on the back of the video box if you ever look at it really  yeah they just sell video hey we gotta put someone on uh the spot yes jess you're coming in and asking a  question this is sam's girlfriend she never comes to work with sam ever ever ever but today she did 
[02:01:30]  because she's a huge fan of seth green oh i signed a dvd for him why don't you sit down over there  just sit over there you're a star don't worry you don't have to hover over her she'll be fine without  you for a second now you've never been in studio with us before never first time for everything yep  i've been on the phone but never in studio right and uh how long you've been you and sam been  together actually it's three years tomorrow oh congratulations way to hold on wow they might  be getting engaged well i heard that he's looking at rings right yeah yeah yeah so that's always the 
[02:02:00]  way you want to hear it too on the radio right so you're a huge seth green fan yeah i am i've been  a fan since forever oh thanks can't hardly wait is my favorite movie oh we just did a commentary for  that because it's like 10 years now for real sam for our anniversary i could take that merry christmas  um i gotta be stupid can't hardly wait what was that it was kind of the resurgence of like teen  comedy movies there was a point in time where they weren't making any movies like this and this 
[02:02:30]  was a throwback to john hughes-y style movies nice yeah it's the best i gotta have sex tonight  it sounds like you're in luck so do you have a question for seth green robot chicken star wars  out on dvd i know i'm very excited for that well i actually want to know where were you born  uh in philadelphia oh really but you were in you were in you know the media and everything since day  one how did that happen well not technically day one uh i've actually been pretty fortunate to avoid  the media for the most part i find that that uh you know tabloid media doesn't really care about 
[02:03:00]  comedians you look at like sasha cohen or ben stiller or any of those guys they don't really  they don't really care and since i don't have sex with anybody famous visibly no one bothers me  yeah i mean that works definitely but as far as movies how old were you when you got started uh i  did my first acting job like professional acting job when i was seven and i did my first feature when  i was eight were you were you independently motivated or was it yeah yeah no i just i was lucky enough to  have direction when i was very young i'm just gonna chase that i'm just gonna sit back yeah not work i 
[02:03:30]  like not the funniest of interviews my favorite part so far is the way jess said so you were in  the media spotlight since day one and said said no i really haven't been much and she went okay good  and then just continued day one she already has follow-up questions and everything i know we  usually are like yeah i just wanted to it's almost like that's this is what prep sounds like i know  like i don't know what may sounds like us us you surprised jess to come in here and like talk to 
[02:04:00]  one of our favorite celebrities and she can speak like a human being i know but anytime any wrestler  comes in here and you're like sam ask him questions i just collapse look at sam's first  self-deprecating piece of humor right there only because it was in defense of his girl yeah you are  well played sam you whipped you are so uh what do you think of the hair i'm so ready for him to shave  it it's gotta go i was hoping that i could maybe shave it really yep i'm thinking about sam all i can tell  you is that it is a valuable thing to shave your head at least once in your life i recommend several 
[02:04:30]  times myself this hair is the mane of a champion from afro wars then then i recommend you cut it  into a glorious mohawk thank you that would actually be very cool afro wars is over hey jess any other  questions for seth you know you got robot chicken season four they're about to start that july 22 right  well that's when the star wars dvd comes out oh okay but somewhere in the midst of this interview we  have good facts yeah somewhere they just might not all be connected to each other you got a robot 
[02:05:00]  chicken question for him no not that i can think of i mean i'm impressed with how dynamic his career  has been that you know he produces as well as acts and i just stay busy thank you well i thank you  thank you for letting me come in she's so gracious she's falling apart yes now she's falling apart we  gotta just let her sit there for two more minutes it's gonna get ugly i want to see her completely  degenerate into a puddle yeah i'm gonna am i all red now you're getting a little you're gonna start  doing the chris farley interview really soon that was awesome oh my gosh when you were wearing that 
[02:05:30]  blue shirt and you had the headset on that was so cool there's nothing worse than when it's going  really well and all of a sudden you just run out of steam oh that's the worst yeah are you implying  that's what happened well that's what happened to us that's why we invited jess in yes it's  happened to me every time i've talked to somebody who i admire i i start off gangbusters who's on  that list uh anybody in black sabbath um ozzy a lot of actors there is a one quick wearing a black 
[02:06:00]  sabbath shirt which it's all about he's the biggest ozzy black sabbath fan and he did an interview  are the osbournes gonna come through here for the new show uh hopefully yeah we just we just had her  on the phone yeah i think oh you mean for the variety show yeah i'd love the variety show yeah i'd pay my  own airfare to perform on that there's an interview though that jimmy did with black  sabbath and uh who were you talking to about the dress it was it was that was that wow all right  it was zach wild and uh we have that clip he why would he rock uh i'm sorry right he i'm not really 
[02:06:30]  asks a question that is just a rambling babbling mess of a question and uh we find it very funny we're  gonna find it's very endearing it's nice because it's jimmy being honestly taken sitting there in  front of one of his childhood heroes no zach wasn't zach i like a lot sabbath i was so  blown away because i got to interview them one-on-one i was so horrified that i was actually  good like it was almost like i was beyond being terrified you were much better than i was well 
[02:07:00]  sometimes you just shock yourself into a abject reality like i've met people that i'm so impressed by  you know the burdens on me to act normal so you actually have some kind of valuable interaction  with them it is you know but but sometimes in that that moment you're so freaked out that you  wind up being crazy normal who blew you away who did you want to meet that you met that was like  i bumped into denzel washington like by accident we were both at uh show west in vegas coming out of  like interview booths and i literally bumped right into him and had a moment where i was like oh hey 
[02:07:30]  seth nice to meet you shook his hand i was like your movie looks really good i'm excited to see it  that kind of thing how do you deal with this kind of press it seems like a weird sensation this that  and the other thing and uh barely had three lines into it and then burt reynolds who was uh in the  movie that i had done uh gravity goes denzel and just like pushes him into a corner and just corners  him and starts having a conversation with him and i just i totally let that happen and the thing about  burt no one denies him burt pushes you into a corner to have a conversation you are in that corner  having a conversation hey yeah we've done denzel know you right he knew you were uh he didn't give 
[02:08:00]  any indication no oh no come on but did he treat you like a fanboy or did he like no he was nice he's  a classy he's a classy gentleman he's gotta know who you are i'm sure i don't know i never put it  past anybody you should have mentioned x you should have said you would certainly should have gotten  the best actor for x why'd they give that to pacino it would have won him right over  i'll hug you for that sounds like pandering no it's true we got the jimmy thing asking about  the dress this is silly let's hear it we did something in a dress i don't it was fucking 
[02:08:30]  it was it was in philadelphia oh god okay perhaps that was a plate on the other side of reality clip  this is the f word make sure that we can play this that's fun i love when we do that it's so funny  because uh obviously we do a show um from uh 9 to 11 on xm satellite radio exclusively where you  don't have to beat it down yeah and there's no uh you know we can say whatever you want so whenever  something comes to mind we forget whether it was done here or over there and sometimes 
[02:09:00]  like cold just like that we pop it in a play and it's just like okay i forgot about that little  thing called the fcc you can always play the banana clip that happened last week with gene  simmons well you offered him your banana no man we had gene simmons on the show and that was an  adventure have you guys had him in here yeah he's he's an ass well i'll tell you what he brought his  son with him his son nick who is hilariously cool that kid came in and and uh he came to do a couple 
[02:09:30]  bits on the show too the kid's a really good actor first of all yeah sharp as hell took direction but  gene because i've met him a couple times before and he had no recollection any of those times but  of course when his kid came in his kid was just busting his balls relentlessly and to see a father  son dynamic yeah between gene simmons and his son is hilarious that's awesome yeah he was busting  gene's balls like oh crazy he's in the booth and every single time he does something nick would just  click over he's like that was great dad here's gene was hungry and wanted uh jimmy's banana it's really 
[02:10:00]  quick i how was it i gotta because you know roasting gene was was you know you say i'll take  a bite sure you can have the whole thing um i'll actually share it with you if you want  you know the banana he saw a moment there where he could share a piece of fruit with gene simmons  how do you not who would want to though yeah why go i'll share it with you if you want you know what  it is it's the fact that he offered him the whole banana first and then had this quick second thought 
[02:10:30]  like no wait i could share it with him and that'll be a moment and then i'll say that i shared it with  both our mouths touch it at the same time yeah right do you do a little i'm just putting that out  there do a little double dung banana action while you eat it what are you doing i've done nothing  but humiliate myself in front of kiss members i've just humiliated myself uh roland has a question  for seth i hear roland uh roland's are you setting him up iraq and jess you got to have one final  question for seth green maybe a little family guy question or something we haven't even talked about 
[02:11:00]  chris here did you get a picture at least no i'd love it we better get it quick i have got to go  here's uh roland roland yeah hello hey roland do you have a question for seth green i don't think  so no you do you told me it go ahead no i will not make out with you roland  all right what's the new uh star wars the robot chicken dvd the commentary yes way to bring it back  to subject thank you uh july 22nd the special features which are really cool two hours of extra 
[02:11:30]  he talks about uh he got burt reynolds and dom de louise together first time in 15 years  that's that's on the first season of uh robot chicken yeah in the uh special features uh i did  a movie with burt reynolds and uh befriended him and fell desperately in love with him as most  people do when they're in his presence and i got invited to dinner at his house that dom had cooked  that's a call you like to get he's like hey seth it's burt i just wanted to let you know dom's  cooking tonight it'd be great if you came by and i was like i will be there dude i'm totally coming 
[02:12:00]  yeah um and so i sweet talked him into uh coming and doing the show and they did like a cannonball  run bit in the first season which is on our dvd what's your favorite burt reynolds moment on film  uh in his films or in our film because oh man anytime he smiles on camera it's just glorious  sorry roland's very ticklish he's very ticklish  roland being tickled he may he laughs like a little boy it's so sweet watch watch watch 
[02:12:30]  he's not faking that's the most bizarre you might want to put that on robot chicken  because it's just bizarre man he just loses it you're right do you realize you just did what  everyone does to us but what now you don't put this on your show  he'll be putting us in robot chicken before you know it he'll be talking about don't tell him  anything i've got a radio show all about the boys on the radio 
[02:13:00]  you're loving people do that it's my favorite yeah don't talk in front of him it'll end up on  his show well people pitch me sketches all the time really yeah and people don't understand but  it's very interesting because you get to see exactly what people think the show is versus  what it actually is it was like here's the scene batman is really giving it the strawberry shortcake  okay and she's like oh my berries my berries and he he says i am the knight  and you're just like a a there is no legal defensible parody in that joke whatsoever not to mention the 
[02:13:30]  fact that it is unbelievably unfunny and this is i have to shatter people's dreams all the time by  telling them they're they're sketch good how do you let them off the hook that's funny do you let  i usually explain exactly how we write the show and how different our process is from what people  think it is and the jokes that people come up with how arbitrary the the you know the combinations  of elements are and just how diligently we work to make things actually make sense so that we don't  get sued ah that's the key yeah jess anything else family guy i knew you're gonna ask me aside from 
[02:14:00]  robot chicken do you have any movies or anything coming up that because i want i actually made two  movies this year one of which won't be out until next year one that's coming out in october i think  this movie called sex drive with uh clark duke and james marsden where i play an amish kid  and uh next year uh april i think they're putting it out this movie i do with uh john travolta and  rob williams called old dogs very big old family comedy for you and your kids 
[02:14:30]  that sounds very good well i'll be there i hope so why does it take so long for the movies to come  out well this actually you know this had to do with uh the writer's strike and the way that disney  organized the release slate kind of an anticipation of a work stoppage they they pushed a couple of  movies and that way they had at least a staggered slate in case they never they couldn't make any  other films sure um and then we reshot the whole ending so oh uh we're gonna end with this sorry  jimmy what is this jimmy asking zach wild about the f-bomb yeah it's just a stupid buy robot chicken 
[02:15:00]  star wars dvd july 22nd i got my copy should have saw it before seth came in i actually and then we  would have needed uh just to come in and ask some questions let's be honest let's be honest i like  the idea of a fan asking uh questions like that who's not used to it because it's it's like a thrill  it's like you take focus of meeting people well let's uh really get into this would you blow off  sam for seth green like it would be real easy right absolutely it wouldn't even be a problem  that's awkward because i'm not looking for a relationship you wouldn't even you wouldn't 
[02:15:30]  even think twice right not at all sam would be so gone oh sam don't don't take that shit at that  point i mean that stuff but yeah without a doubt i mean you would just leave your stuff in the  apartment right live together i guess yeah but you would just you would be like i don't need that  anymore yeah did you have a crush on seth at any point you're very handsome i still do have a  crush on seth i love you guys are so silly and thank you yeah you watch buffy a lot oh yeah  yeah me and my dad we watch buffy all the time wow all right sam all right well sam's a little 
[02:16:00]  red sheet he's a little embarrassed yeah but sam would understand right you have to understand that  one you're holding a camera for this dumb show yeah and he's seth what are you gonna do but who's  who's the girl on your list i mean who would who's the girl that would walk you out oh sean  cena he has a big crush he's got a big crush on who kristin bell oh she's you had her in the  little blonde girl oh really the hero she's on that she's all right beyonce kristin bell is like 
[02:16:30]  nerd delight though for a second i thought you said kristin bell no that's my crush right  so that doesn't offend you at all a little bit to hurt your feelings now sam you gotta understand  i mean i understand it'd be better if he wasn't like for instance in the room  see because when when girls usually you know 99.9 of the american public if the guy asked the girl  that question or vice versa they give an answer you they're never going to see the person what's the  dumb conversation that it's always it's always all right what's your freebie or your gimme my husband 
[02:17:00]  gave me one well mine is brad pitt i gotta tell you knowing that she's never gonna get near him  but now i always i always like to pick somebody reasonably attainment somebody kind of that's  the bit well i'm picking the secretary i work with you know who's on my list yeah the new intern  right yeah you can have brad pitt all you want i'm my my one and only is the intern that started  i picked the uh i picked the um channel 11 traffic girl i made it easy crazy yo wait that's not the 
[02:17:30]  real time is it yeah i know oh boy you gotta go where i'm supposed to go meet somebody for another  interview for a drink yeah drink it where are you going next i actually it's only a couple blocks  away but i gotta get to uh uh ap to an ap interview i almost said i was associated press to explain  what ap is i suck by the way sam your girlfriend wants to sleep with seth yeah perhaps yeah and he's 
[02:18:00]  in the room it's usually okay listen if you guys are free after 11 and you still got that camera  just a cuckold with a camera no no we'll set it up on a tripod sam we're getting the action  i guess the haps would be in hindsight maybe this should have been one of those interviews that i  told jess about like this afternoon right and she'd have gone oh you should have told me to watch the 
[02:18:30]  video jim i don't think we have time to play the no i know why do you think i kept talking  you're very lucky will you guys burn it to mp3 for me i'll put it in my phone yes please there it  is so the you might want it for your show yeah i'm putting it on the program don't put me in  the cartoon n-o-r-t um all right lucy mcgillicuddy  all right we gotta thank seth green it was it really was we gotta thank seth we're so late we

[02:35:30]  teasers to prove that he wasn't lying girls are a lot of girls uh junior high girls even elementary  school girls are taking pictures of themselves naked and in various states of distress and uh sending  it to their boyfriends or uh you know guys they like and you know what happens those relationships  don't last long oh well what's and then what should happen is those pictures should make it  our way so we could you know alert the authorities do some research into writing a book pete townsend 
[02:36:00]  look at this picture this girl is trying to touch her toes and the other girl is just drilling her  with a green dildo wow i love teamwork i also have uh look at this i'm not going to give it out but  now we're talking video oh well let me see some oh and a tna with oh and a video possibly well  uh a lot of people wondering why they have to do the emergency test during the show i don't know well  i we we did know this it was on the prep sheet but i want to know why nobody came in before and said 
[02:36:30]  guys in five minutes or two minutes we had this in the middle of the discussion yeah that's what we  need to do oh these are big and why do we ever have those tests during the show i i have no idea  i think you could find out if the fucking thing works like at two in the morning but is that xm's  choice or no that might not be their choice do it during that show that's on after us who's that i  don't know uh yeah steve can i ask steve i don't want to bust his boss i just want to ask him don't 
[02:37:00]  bust my balls no no i don't want i'm a ballerina oh yes i don't i don't want to bust his what do  ballerinas wear uh tutus all right oh look at this file yeah it's gonna take it's gonna be a little  while in the meantime we can talk to roland roland went to ricky gervais with us last night with his  brother we met uh roland's brother last night oh what is that like like meeting roland but taller  is it he's taller why are you laughing at that i don't know because i think it's funny because 
[02:37:30]  he's i know i think we're different but he but he looks like he has glasses yes he does like  really yeah i was looking at his face i'm like that's fucking rolling even though they look different  there's there's something about them that defines them as brothers in the middle of the face you can  see like when you look in the middle of the face there were certain angles their mouth from the  side i was just watching the children profile yeah and uh it was funny to talk to the what's your  brother's name roger roger and roland roger mexican's name roger and roland yeah what the hell's that 
[02:38:00]  about steve thank god i love my dad didn't name us after like taco and yeah steve why are you in  here uh because jimmy wanted me in here to explain about the i just wanted to ask how come no one came  in and told us we're in a thing a thing uh would you like someone to come in and tell you from now on  when the emergency broadcast well i mean in i mean in addition to the two times that i said it  yesterday and the fact that it was on the prep sheet this morning and that we discussed it in 
[02:38:30]  the meeting yesterday you know what though i think there should there probably should be okay because  that's kind of even though like that's kind of far away to kind of remember that at a certain minute  something's gonna beep or something in the middle of the show i think right before it okay i think we  go you know and it doesn't matter it doesn't have to be this little covert no there can be anybody  just say hey guys it's gonna be a fucking beep because we would have stopped the discussion  and goofed on it for a minute like we would have if we knew it was coming we would have acknowledged 
[02:39:00]  all right this fucking brought you know we would have talked about it yeah all right all right yeah  and then it comes back and we could yell like that wasn't a test oh my god right and we know we  have no control over when those happen no i think we didn't right can we just spill something on  on that red carpet like would that get us in trouble yeah there's cops everywhere there are  cops there's so many fucking cops one thing i would like them to do though why can't they just carpet  all the streets in manhattan it felt so nice to walk across didn't it when it's soft nice and soft 
[02:39:30]  it's very nice carpet all the streets in manhattan the homeless will cut it thank you what's that  rolling the homeless will cut it out you're right leave it to roll rolling to be the real guy that  jimmy goofs on rolling a literal guy could cut it up as opposed to what like eight hours later all  the buses chewing it up into nothingness anyway with the fact the indoor outdoor carpeting yeah  what could it be what about rain what about traction hey oh who's gonna evacuate it's gotta be vacuumed 
[02:40:00]  your color there's a picture of roland's brother pet stains yeah that's him wow he looks like a real  bruiser though he is he's a big boy he looks mean i've seen him get pissed off before and knock the  guy out is he a crazy when he gets mad no but when he does get mad it's like it's over worse than me  and the guy i'm like adios is he a crazy fuck when he gets mad no but when he gets mad he's worse than  me it's like so you're saying he's a crazy fuck when he gets mad yes no but he is there's a reason i'm 
[02:40:30]  rolling in here by the way because he admitted that he's blind as a bat and refuses to wear glasses  or contact lenses and can we get an eye test yeah yeah we could yeah and how many print out a chart  how many feet uh do you have to be i don't know it just depends i'll figure it out every day for my  allergies probably 20 feet i can't see well so 20 20 20 no why don't you get glasses i don't know  what are you afraid you're gonna look stupid no he told a story where he didn't even recognize his 
[02:41:00]  boss at work or something because she walked by hey i'm like hey what up and they kept on walking  she goes hello i'm like then i walked closer like ah he's unbelievable what is uh 2020 i forgot it's 20  okay that's right i forgot it's if you see something it's a certain amount 20 high or something and then  a certain amount of feet or yards away what is it help me help me 2020 look at the white lion cubs i'm 
[02:41:30]  sorry it's a snellen eye chart and that's read 20 feet from the chart that's my time at 20 feet you  should try to read the letters on the sixth row from the top if you could read that line it means you  have visual acuity of 20 40 or better 20 40 or better all right can we set it up on a screen or  uh i think it has to be a certain size i'm sure yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm having them print it  out all right we'll bring it out uh we're going backwards kevin in chicago he's a lawyer kevin hey

[02:48:30]  for the first time now this girl runs over gets on her knees and just starts eating this girl out  who's still standing and hoping that they might serve the volleyball sometime soon yeah yes i don't  think they were worried about the volleyball at all the um the the real interesting part about this  thing that i forgot was there was a big to do that these strippers had to wear pasties  even under their bikini tops just in case their bikini tops came off during the volleyball play 
[02:49:00]  so if you notice they're wearing these stick-on little stars on their nipples and hearts yeah and  things like that so the first girl that takes her top off you notice that she's got hearts yeah over  her nipples yeah pasties but the the second thing she does after her top comes off she rips her bottoms  off yeah so now thank god you can't see her nipples but fucking steakums are flying out from  between her legs well the radio station had good intentions back then yeah you know it all failed

[02:58:00]  20 20 i actually want to well you go after roll yeah i want to see uh you gotta do the six line or  something like that all right rolling you got the line 20 20 is 20 point we need a mic on uh roll 20  point font at 20 feet i do believe that is really rolling no 20 point okay plus the lighting conditions  are not ideal i thought it was you see stuff at 20 feet that you're supposed to see at 20 feet  like the way it's supposed to look well you know what anthony people fit one all right 
[02:58:30]  roland's on the line can you see this can you see the chart roland are you supposed to shut one eye  you ch that's that's the big the big one that starts it all uh which line is he supposed to read six  down uh this very last line would indicate the last line you're supposed to read no you're wrong  that there's no way 2020 is that hard to read that's got to be 24 it could did something the  size of the paper something is wrong let me see i'm used to it because that is 
[02:59:00]  that'll make sense okay i will read the third one up from the bottom is h l o p s  and then the other one is z x b a e i can't read that what are you reading is that the one  is that the second the one up one up from the bottom what z 
[02:59:30]  i think i need glasses yeah you you said it with such confidence z x o a l wow  uh hold on how many did you get wrong danny uh half wait no z y b a p no mother's cut z okay no i'll  read the one above it though h l o p s that is correct okay the other one is ludicrous there's no way  anyone's reading z f d a x there see i did it yeah i did it oh see it's got better oh thanks which one

[03:01:00]  oh fuck you're 23 000 that's crazy i think i think the problem is you gotta light up the  the chart and the crinkling in the paper is ruining everything how about this is all about  rolling how do we hijack we all want to see how all right good we are hold on can we light  up the area better does anyone work we can light that up with a nuclear bomb and not read that  fucking line well you that's bullshit i believe this is like as lit up as it gets in here yeah  hold on can we turn off all the lights except for that one that might help highlight a little

[03:08:30]  oh boy  oh boy yeah  no one's uh left alone here  it's terrible i got something fun for everybody  oh a fun sound clip this is going to be fun for everyone  listen to this  faith mitchell has down syndrome and considering the statistics she's lucky to be celebrating her  fourth birthday  oh the fact is an overwhelming majority of parents who find out their baby will likely be born with down 
[03:09:00]  syndrome choose to terminate the pregnancy  many people including faith's parents believe doctors are partially to blame for the high rate of down  syndrome abortions which blame  doctors are to blame that's what you're supposed to do  holy  shit no let's be real here  obviously if you uh uh have a baby and it has down syndrome i i'm not you know ridiculous you love 
[03:09:30]  the child you raise it you do whatever you do just like uh you do with uh any other kid i'm sure it's  more difficult whatever  you're gonna say just like you would do with a puppy  not well you know i'm just saying but if you know and have the opportunity to terminate you're  you're gonna fucking do it you know why be burdened doctors are blamed how about that  fucking fifth of old granddad  while the fucking womb is still full  fucking mom 
[03:10:00]  how about the old topple down the stairs for being lippy  how about that  oh god damn let's say hi to turtle turtle  fuzzy wuzzy was a bear please shave my back hair  hair okay i like i like where it was going yeah sure let's go to california tony  hey guys what's happening hey  hey i opened the closet door now i am out 
[03:10:30]  i did that one jimmy did that  oh jack and jill went up the hill  both with a pail of water and that jill sure was lucky because jack was dishy  for the high rate of down syndrome abortions which some studies put as high as 90 percent  yeah they give you a bleak picture you go out there and you're scared you don't know what to do  because you have pre you think of all these great things and it's all like taken away from you in an 
[03:11:00]  instant the mitchell say during those gut-wrenching minutes after the diagnosis they got the feeling  that their doctors were pressuring them to abort faith the focus they say was on the medical  difficulties many children with down syndrome have like heart trouble and how hard they are to raise  due to their learning disability we know why they even told me that that it could be a burden on my  son as he grows up they don't need to explain why it's hard to raise a child with down syndrome 
[03:11:30]  because he's always winning the spelling bee i give up the only one it's easy on is the barber  he knows right away  okay the number two  you have a choice one or two  jimmy come back jimmy come back oh my god i'm so far away yeah oh my god was that 
[03:12:00]  fucking funny man ready for this this this this next clip is only this next clip is only 40 seconds  long but it could i'm thinking it could take 20 minutes to play oh no what is it could be one of  those things the mitchells and others raising children with down syndrome say they want  doctors to give expecting parents a more complete picture including the positive points 
[03:12:30]  a stamp licker  lick a whole fucking mat at one time if you need a piano moved  need to post huge genitals on the internet  um if you want something with the  a fleshy piggy bank 
[03:13:00]  i do love their change  including the positive points positive points if you enjoy saying hey charlie hustle  oh no positive points yes positive i'd love to hear a picture including  the positive points they're special they're the most loving people you ever meet in your life  and uh no um i think they deserve a chance doctors that's the positive points they deserve a shot 
[03:13:30]  they're special they're the most loving people you'll ever meet  i don't know about that i i don't know if that could be uh held up they also love bricks and trees  and throwing them at your head every so often  and uh um i think they deserve a chance doctors are not prepared when it comes to delivering that  diagnosis dr brian scotko who is a sister with down syndrome authored a 2005 study while he was in 
[03:14:00]  medical school that showed that most parents of children with down syndrome thought that doctors  indeed focused on worst case scenarios the medical community has heard the complaints  what are you supposed to focus on the complaints are from people obviously that have  down syndrome children it's not from the people that aborted them  it's not you know and obviously you can understand why they would be upset  you know it's like anything else if you get a a you have a child and there's anything wrong with 
[03:14:30]  it or something you're not gonna you know hate the kid you gotta raise it you gotta kind of pay  attention to it i guess because you always hear that it's like well that when we first heard or  found out it was very difficult but oh my god she's so special and so smart in such special ways  really we're officially not doing line of the day they all have that stupid hairdo oh that hair 
[03:15:00]  at least get one a perm do something yeah permanent you gotta get yourself a permanent  and then don't wind up getting things caught in it it has to just be simple that you know they  don't know what to do not that imaginary light bulb  bing paulie from australia 
[03:15:30]  the idea dopes yes paulie from australia right  loving of course they are loving they love that you didn't drown the  fucking waterhead at birth oh  fuck see that's i'm i'm trying to be a realist without being too harsh i mean of course we're  having fun here but for god's sake if you know that it's gonna happen and the doctor uh suggests  aborting it well we got the fuck yeah the last clip we got a couple that terminated the pregnancy  and guess what they want it back they feel no guilt whatsoever really 
[03:16:00]  jeff terminated a pregnancy more than two years ago after receiving a down syndrome diagnosis they  didn't want us to use their last names they say the decision was very difficult for them but they  have no regrets i did not feel any guilt about the moron makers they say they didn't get the feeling  that their doctors pushed them in any one direction but they say many people made them feel bad for  deciding to have an abortion here we are going through a loss and you know there there are people 
[03:16:30]  out there there are a lot of people out there who who uh who look down on what we chose to do down  since then they've had a child with no birth defects there you go the mitchell say they never considered  aborting faith but are very careful not to judge anyone who makes that choice because they say as sure  as they are that they made the right decision they also know how difficult it is to have that decision  to make when the doctor comes in with the diagnosis sheets and uh he's flipping through the pages with 
[03:17:00]  a hanger you know that he's probably trying to push you in a certain direction he takes both of your  coats but he's got three hangers  look i don't want to push oh that's fucking hilarious oh shit he's got a hoover but there's no rug in  here oh no  uh it's it's it's it's ridiculous 
[03:17:30]  both your coats but he's got three  anthony's on fire with the retard star  with the retard star  you gotta be a realist walter chicago walter right oh what's happening hey walter  how we doing today pretty good hi  you know it's it's the god syndrome people are they are an actually a wonderful type of person 
[03:18:00]  because they give you so much to look to look at they don't even try they're just funny  jesus what do you mean that took a turn yeah  without even trying they they care so much about everybody else besides themselves and i've  got it i've got a person that's been in my family for 51 years severe down syndrome wow 
[03:18:30]  another four years she'll make it into the guinness book of world records for being the oldest  how old is the oldest 62 is in the record books right now  so i mean if they don't without even trying they they do give you a lot of joy in life but it they  do take a lot of work yeah you know i'm not gonna say that they don't but it it is funny that they  can bring you so much joy but they do take a lot of work that's the same thing as uh restoring a classic 
[03:19:00]  car right brings a lot of joy but takes a lot of work yeah and the car is smarter  if the car's in edsel  what are we doing to this guy it's been 59 years or something yeah what's the what what's the  relation an uncle or an answer no it's just it's somebody who was orphaned oh what would they adopt you  would wow wow that wasn't very nice the lord has a place for you in heaven my friend well he didn't

[03:36:00]  just let him go just let him go on whatever they're saying yeah what's what was that dude  what was that what would you finish that with because it trailed off after just let him go  you said just let him go no just let him go that's that's all it was just let him keep  rambling okay it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't like a an insult or anything towards you no no  because i like it when you guys sit there and complain about the fucking eas test and nobody  telling you anything about it oh okay so i thought it would have been kind of funny  behind the scenes derrick making a rare on mic appearance yeah yeah derrick just saunters in 
[03:36:30]  once in a while yes very rare medicated just fucking wearing school shooter shorts and just  no socks fucking dainty tennis socks chats i can creep all up all right i'm gone uh and he can't  take it yeah he gets out early no i understand tap out just let let him go just let him go just let  him go let him go we gotta get over a red carpet yeah let's get over that red carpet all right guys 
[03:37:00]  it was fun yes we didn't even get to talk to sam about jess uh wanting to bang uh seth green oh my  god yeah definitely where's sam maybe oh no there's no time all right we got one more minute one more  minute what's the haps it's oh my god it's like 10 50. they closed i'm not gonna get out of here  hey well we should do that in um we'll do uh one minute with sam sam yes what's up wants seth green  really bad yes she does i don't know where she is right now oh shit oh shit and uh apparently i don't 
[03:37:30]  know where seth green is either uh but you never do no because he's a big star right and i'm a nobody  doesn't that make you feel a little um insecure when did we just catch sam doing a bit there's  just right there oh ah he's doing a bit you're doing a bit she's right i don't know where she  is oh she might be with seth oh i don't know well sam she's right here oh thank god i didn't know where  she was i was so busy working what a great actor you never do bits like that i always do bits not like 
[03:38:00]  that it was so hack what are you talking about i didn't know where she was what was the bit huh i  i didn't know he didn't know where you were you were with seth green what kind of sex would you  allow seth green to do what what would you allow seth and just yeah i think that's fair enough what  would i allow no no like like what what would be the move for for jess what would your ideal scenario 
[03:38:30]  be yeah i don't know that's kind of an awkward question that's a private thing you know between  me and seth what oh you hear that between her and seth sam well danny held up his fantasy girl  isn't that great what did danny say hey i mean she's cute he held up a sign that says butt sex  spelled e-c-k-s yeah that's the way you spell it which i would be vehemently opposed to oh okay  have you really t-o'd if you came home and said you had butt sex and why so there's a level of 
[03:39:00]  sex that's worse than something else well so vaginal would be oh oh better better than you would allow  that more more than you would sex why well because then it's like you're saving that for  marriage that's we gotta save something that's the shithole that doesn't matter to anybody really  we were talking about this recently that's not the special place women really should be saving  the vagina for marriage just giving the dumper up yeah yeah but if a guy came up to you and said i  fucked your chick you'd be like that sucks and a guy came up to you i fucked your chicken yes i'd jerk off
