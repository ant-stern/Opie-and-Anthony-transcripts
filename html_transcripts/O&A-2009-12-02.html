<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, primarily revolving around the Tiger Woods infidelity scandal, the upcoming “Homeless Shopping Spree” event (scheduled for December 17th), and an in-studio interview with Jesse Ventura.

The show opened with discussions surrounding the Tiger Woods scandal, heavily featuring leaked voicemails where Woods pleaded with a mistress to remove her name from his phone.  The hosts, along with female guest Star and a male guest (who was heavily mocked for his empathetic response), engaged in crude and sexually explicit commentary, speculating on Woods' behavior and the mistresses' motives.  They also ridiculed the over-the-top coverage by entertainment news shows.  A caller claimed to have had a sexual encounter with Woods.  The segment included clips from various news reports and entertainment shows covering the scandal.

The conversation then shifted to the upcoming Jesse Ventura interview and the "Homeless Shopping Spree,"  interwoven with anecdotes about hangovers and alcohol.  The hosts reminisced about past Sprees, with Danny recounting the massive turnout (approximately 2,500 people) and contrasting reactions.  They also recounted a conflict with radio station employee Tracy Carter,  resulting in lewd and vulgar anecdotes about her.  This led to tangents including listener-submitted animal sounds, a caller’s graphic blowjob story, a poorly received stand-up routine by a caller identifying as "Son of Sam," and another call detailing a leaked Tiger Woods voicemail.  Regular caller Tippi Tom also contributed bizarre and offensive remarks.  The discussion concluded with a brief return to the Homeless Shopping Spree and the hosts’ discussion of pornography websites, before Ventura's arrival.

Jesse Ventura's in-studio appearance dominated the latter half of the show.  He began by discussing his gubernatorial experience, his investigation of HAARP technology (including alleged weather control and mind control capabilities, and a demonstration resulting in sound directly through his skull), and his theories on the 2004 Indonesian tsunami's possible connection to HAARP.  His commentary extended to criticisms of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, advocating for a draft and war tax, expressing skepticism about the official 9/11 narrative, and questioning the government's handling of Osama bin Laden, including the suspension of habeas corpus. He criticized the Bush administration and expressed concerns about civil liberties.  Ventura’s views sparked heated debates with the hosts, particularly regarding government deception and waterboarding, with Ventura citing his family's military history to defend his patriotism.  He also discussed his decision not to run for Senate, attributing it to a coin flip.

Ventura continued promoting his show *Conspiracy* on True TV, discussing further conspiracy theories: the Bilderberg Group, the Mayan calendar predictions for 2012 (including a frightening experience researching a potential solar flare), and the Manchurian Candidate theory, recounting an interview with a man claiming government mind control and showing evidence of implanted chips.  He also expressed skepticism about global warming, suggesting its promotion was aimed at creating a one-world government.

The interview took a sharp, contentious turn with arguments over the Second Amendment, waterboarding, and the treatment of enemy combatants, escalating into personal insults and a tense confrontation, culminating in Ventura's angry departure from the studio. Ronnie B was present in studio for this portion.  The hosts, particularly Opie, strongly criticized Ventura's behavior, describing it as bullying and childish, and further discussed the altercation, focusing on the video recording of the event.  A caller earlier in the show, Dr. Steve, had also explained his mathematical analysis of the World Trade Center collapse, which was met with crude mockery by the hosts. Dr. Michio Kaku also briefly called in, his participation met with similar humor.  The mathematical formula and the ensuing discussion were also part of the program's content.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, deviance.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of death.  We're just gigs.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Cookie, cookie, cookie.  Hi, I'm the O.P. and Anthony Virus, and I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the roll.  You picked the wrong broads.  That's what I say.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show on this fine Whip Em Out Wednesday.  Hi, everybody.  We got a busy show.  Homeless shopping spree is on.  We'll discuss that in a few minutes here.  Game on.  Game on.  Game on.  Thermite paint.  Game on.  Thermite paint.  My conspiracy show. 
[00:01:30]  I guess we have Jesse the Body Ventura.  Governor Ventura coming in today.  Yeah.  Pencil it in for 930 today.  Jesse Ventura.  930.  Thermite paint man.  Fun and hijinks.  The Loch Ness Monster isn't real.  I'll prove there are things I know, and I'm ready to talk.  He's finally ready to talk.  He's finally ready.  The guy hasn't shut up for forever.  Ever since he had a feather boa and big funny pink sunglasses on, he's been yapping. 
[00:02:00]  He's a terrible secret keeper.  And he's, yes.  I know things, and now I'm ready to talk.  Secret societies.  Mind control.  The tooth fairy.  What?  What?  Don't forget Bigfoot.  And the Yeti.  I'm ready to talk.  Is he?  He loves to talk.  He loves it.  He does nothing but talk. 
[00:02:30]  His commercials, I've been watching that true TV, so I see his commercials all the time.  He's so serious.  He's so, like, into this.  What you don't know, you won't believe, or something.  Like the catchphrase, the tagline, the slugline to his show.  It's a little too wordy.  I don't understand it.  It's something like, you won't believe what you don't know.  I think that's it.  You won't believe what you don't know. 
[00:03:00]  Which is, we know what he's trying to say.  Yeah, yeah.  I get what he's trying to say, but it does, it's like, objects in mirror are closer than  they appear.  Does that mean they look closer or really are?  What?  I don't understand.  I want to see that.  You want to see the promo now?  Yeah, because that's all I...  Yeah, we'll find it.  Yeah, find his promo.  He's so serious.  And the first, what they've been doing is promoing the episode one, which is about 
[00:03:30]  HAARP.  What's HAARP?  H-A-A-R-P.  A communications research project or doomsday weapon.  That's one or the other.  It's either a walkie-talkie or an atom bomb.  That can change the weather.  Can change the weather.  Shoot satellites out of orbit.  Right.  And trigger mind control across the globe.  Micah, this thing is just a...  A motherfucker.  Can one object do all those things?  Now, come on.  Ventura and his team head north to a remote... 
[00:04:00]  Ah, we head north and find a predator to a region of Alaska to confront the military  installation called HAARP.  Look, it's a military installation.  Oh, I thought he was doing something on HAARP-O.  No, no, no.  Oh, it's HAARP.  Oprah's company?  Yeah.  Or the Mark's brother.  Which one?  If you go either way with that.  Which one?  HAARP.  HAARP.  Oh, I got it.  That's good.  Yeah, the Dharma Initiative.  The Warren Report.  Stop it.  I'm looking into the Dharma Initiative. 
[00:04:30]  And the island.  Global cover-ups.  Here it is.  Mind control.  Secret societies.  You don't think this stuff is real?  Think again.  I've heard things that'll blow your mind.  I've been on the inside.  And now I'm ready to talk.  I've been on the inside. 
[00:05:00]  And now I'm ready to talk.  Mind control.  I love that one.  What happened?  I want to see him come in with some spinny glasses.  And give us mind control for him.  Like a cartoon character.  With those spinny pinwheel glasses on.  Look into my eyes.  Enough with the fucking Warren Report.  The Warren Report.  They weren't all in on it.  Yes.  I know.  You weren't there, Jimmy. 
[00:05:30]  He's going to tell you you weren't there.  He was.  And you've got to sleep sometime.  Maybe it was Earl Warren.  You're not a Navy SEAL.  Is he going to threaten death?  The secret of X-ray specs.  Rubber dog duty.  The hand buzzers.  Yes.  Sea monkeys.  Whoopie cushions.  Whoopie cushions.  Are they real?  He's hysterical. 
[00:06:00]  I just hope he doesn't threaten to kill us this time.  Because that was scary last time.  He threatened to.  I think he told you you have to sleep sometime.  Yes.  And that he was a Navy SEAL.  I've heard things that Hulk Hogan is supposed to beat Bruno Sammartino way back in 1975.  What did you hear?  Dude, there's a clip of Hulk fighting Ric Flair.  Remember he's doing that down on your tour? 
[00:06:30]  We did a little time on that?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  It is horrendous.  And it's like new stuff.  It's two old men.  Two old men kind of doing what they used to do.  It looks like it's lemon party minus one.  They're just rolling around sucking each other's dick.  Pretty much.  Oh, what is this?  The guy couldn't focus the camera?  Yeah, there's a...  Oh, what's this?  They tried to spice it up with some fucking shit.  Oh, yeah.  They spice it up with some nice young ass, but still.  Oh, my God. 
[00:07:00]  But that's something nice to look at.  Who's looking at what's going on in the fucking ring?  Look at her fucking vag.  Just sticking out, basically.  Who is that broad?  I don't know.  She's one of the broads.  I don't know, but I'm getting mind control from her rectum.  Oh, God.  Now, Flair's all bloody and laying on the mat.  Oh, this is embarrassing.  It's also in good shape, though.  Terrible.  Yeah, he's definitely in good shape.  Jesus Christ.  And his new broad looks exactly like his daughter. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, really?  That's on TMZ, if you want to see that.  He's still doing the thumbs up at all the corner.  Oh, yeah.  Does he do the thing with his arm and then puts his hand in his ear?  Oh, God, stop it.  He did put some weight on him.  Could you just...  Yeah, yeah.  His skin looks like, on his body, looks like Stretch Armstrong when you twist him.  Like, what happens?  I feel bad for the guy.  I'm sure he doesn't want to be wrestling anymore, but his... 
[00:08:00]  For him, look at poor Ric Flair.  Well, both of them don't want to be wrestling, but they both are getting effed.  They don't have any money left, so they have to do this.  Ric Flair looks like a guy that, like an old man that stepped off the curb  and got hit by a bus, and they're helping him to the hospital.  He just said that.  It looks horrid.  They're too old to be doing that.  I feel bad, though.  Oh.  I think Hulk's wife did a number on him, and now he's got a freaking wrestler again.  She used mind control.  So, Jesse, coming in at 9.30. 
[00:08:30]  Can't wait.  And then I want to thank Dr. Steve for that email he sent out last night.  I'm just reading it.  Did you see that one fucking formula he sent with the email?  Yeah, I know.  I actually knew that.  Oh, my God.  No, you didn't.  No, you knew that one?  No, I didn't.  All right.  I'm not even going to...  I put that into my computer, and it exploded.  Right.  Mine did.  It went to nerd.com, and it was fucking Steve's picture.  Jimmy, explain the Dr. Steve email last night.  Well, I noticed I had an itchy on my genitals. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, I already know the other one.  No, it was about...  There was a mathematical thing they talk about when the towers fell.  There's an equation which explains gravity and the rate of gravity.  I don't understand it, but it explains why the towers fell at the rate they did.  Yeah.  And I was actually looking at his second email.  He said, okay, my math is right, but my point is off a bit after listening to the replay.  He was saying that what Jesse was saying wasn't debating how long it should have taken.  Jesse was saying that there was resistance coming down, and he actually sided with Kaku, 
[00:09:30]  which was weird to see Dr. Steve side with Kaku.  Oh, my God.  Dr. Steve.  They hate each other.  Or Steve hates Dr. Kaku.  And Dr. Kaku doesn't even know who Dr. Steve is.  Yes, yes.  Let's be realistic.  Why does the gingerbread man hate me?  I come in to help.  The gingerbread...  Why does the cookie man with the doctorate hate me?  Dude, why does the horrendous winemaker hate me?  Yes.  Look at the chemical makeup of his wine.  Yes.  It's like liquid feet. 
[00:10:00]  It's like...  It's like...  It's...  It's...  It's grape urine.  Like when a big bang comes out of my iney hole after chili.  After I eat chili con carne.  He calls...  It's Oscar the Grouch's pre-con.  And he calls it wine.  I got one of the formulas, though, from the original.  Do you have that?  Okay.  Uh...  Wow.  The formula is distance equals half times acceleration times time squared. 
[00:10:30]  Or...  Yes.  Well, that...  Indubitably.  Well, he had to write it out for us, but it's basically D equals one slash two...  Yeah.  A-T asterisk asterisk two.  Right.  Everyone knows that, right?  Yeah.  Come on.  I got it.  I got that bumper sticker.  Solving for time, we get time equals...  I see that as squirt, but it's S-Q-R-T...  Yes.  Pereru.  ...stintacy...  I know.  Two D slash A. 
[00:11:00]  Yep.  And then don't forget...  Why are you writing this to us?  We don't know this shit.  He could have just messed it up on purpose.  None of us would know.  Sure.  And don't forget, time equals the square root two times 415 meters.  I think it's divided by 9.8 meters, divided by speed, divided by speed.  Good reading.  The, um...  Jesus.  I have no idea what... 
[00:11:30]  Wakaku said the towers are mostly air.  Mostly air.  And they are.  And I think when those pieces buckled out, it was a free fall.  It was all in a free fall.  They weren't each stopping and hitting the next one.  He acts like everything...  Ka-chong.  Ka-chong.  It wasn't falling like cake getting sliced.  No.  It was falling like the pieces that were holding it, all the pieces were kind of suspended  and attached to that fucking, uh...  Yes.  ...the outside girders.  When they buckled out, everything just fell.  Yeah.  All at the same time.  Yeah.  Picture how you would fall down taking one sip of Dr. Steve's wine when you hit the ground. 
[00:12:00]  It's like the Candyland ladder where you would slide down to a magical place.  Kevin from Connecticut writes, Dr. Steve's formula looks like a cartoon swear word to me.  That's funny.  So, I don't know.  Dr. Steve is trying to help us out.  Whatever.  But we'll get into it with Jesse Ventura.  And Dr. Kaku is calling as well.  I think we're going to, you know, have a little debate here.  I don't think Jesse knows that we've got the great Dr. Kaku calling when he's in. 
[00:12:30]  It's just the point of, it's just the math is the only part that I can't...  We all saw what happened.  Well, because...  Here's a good way to describe exactly what Jimmy was talking about.  Picture, picture, uh, take some, uh, take, uh, two little miniature ladders, right?  Okay.  Little ladders that are about one feet tall with little rungs on them, right?  Maybe taller.  Now put, no, they have to be one foot tall.  Okay.  That's tiny, though.  Now put them together and put dominoes on each rung, right? 
[00:13:00]  Wait, can we make it three feet?  No!  Okay, three feet.  That's good.  All right.  Why are you putting pizza on the rungs, Anthony?  Not dominoes.  Are you happy with three feet?  The little domino things.  Yeah, I'm very happy with it.  Jimmy's happy with three feet, too.  Yes, we're happy with three feet.  Two three-foot ladders.  Three-foot little dominoes.  Tiny ladders.  Delicious treats.  You're holding them in your hand, and you put dominoes, no, the ones that the Hispanics  play with.  Okay.  All the time.  That's racist.  And you put them, but they do.  And you put them between the rungs.  You lay them in between the rungs.  Right.  Now, take your hands and pull the ladders apart. 
[00:13:30]  The dominoes aren't going to stay suspended as the top one hits the next one, the next  one down.  They're all going to fall at the same time.  So someone pulled out the buildings from the sides?  Yes, when the sides came out, as Jimmy was giving the example, when the top floors went  and the sides buckled out, there was nothing holding the rest of the floors, i.e. dominoes.  Explain that to Jesse Ventura.  And pulled out and stuff.  What do you mean?  I'll look into that. 
[00:14:00]  Well, can I say something?  I'm getting you with my mind control.  Larry King had Jesse on, and Jesse basically gave his theory that it was impossible for  the towers to fall that way, and Larry had nothing.  Oh, wow.  We have something.  Because Jesse's going to say the same bullshit on our show, and we're going to have Dr.  Kaku on the phone going, no, you're full of shit.  Dr. Kaku.  This is why it felt like it did.  Let's say hi to Dr. Steve real fast here.  Oh, God.  Hi, Dr. Steve.  Hi.  Oh, boys.  Are you awake? 
[00:14:30]  What, are you doing equations?  They're written on his wall like a beautiful mind.  I would love to find out that Dr. Steve's one of those guys.  He's just a fucking kook.  Talk to Ed Harris and some creepy child that doesn't exist.  Right.  Yes.  A raving lunatic.  So, Steve, what was the formula you sent?  That was the rate of descent.  Now, we're correct, right, about how the things buckled out.  Yeah, here's the thing is, if the upper floors fell into nothing, you know, because the floors below them were already collapsing, then the top of the World Trade Center would fall at the rate of free fall. 
[00:15:00]  You know, and the rate of free fall from the top of a building of 415 meters is about 9.2 seconds.  And I sent you guys how I calculated that. 
[00:15:30]  Now, he'll say, well, why were the bottom floor falling?  Nothing hit them.  Yeah, but, no, you're absolutely right.  It doesn't work that way.  It's not like the top floor fell and then sat on top of the, you know, however many stories there were.  110.  Okay.  It didn't just sit on 109 and then 109.  Yeah.  And then collapsed down.  But it doesn't work that way.  And anybody who saw it happen, you know, saw that, you know, the sides buckle out and the center falls in and the floors below are dropping before the one above it, you know, starts to collapse in. 
[00:16:00]  Because when the first one fell, it was like, if you figure, the 72nd or 78th floor got hit and the other tower, the 90th floor.  So when those first things started to collapse, the building starts collapsing from the 72nd floor, it has the weight of fucking 30 floors above it. 
[00:16:30]  And that initial weight drop is what buckles, I think, everything out.  Of course.  You know, Michio Kaku is absolutely right.  The whole thing is made of air.  That pains you, doesn't it?  It's hard to say that.  It's hard to say, right?  No, he's absolutely right.  But it's made of air and, you know, with a little bit of support.  And as that support starts to buckle, then the whole thing is going to collapse from the top down and it's going to fall at the rate of free fall. 
[00:17:00]  See, it isn't like something.  To stop it from doing that.  It isn't like the top floor fell, hit the next one, and then so on, blah, blah, blah.  It was like there was already, even on the other one, there was 90, the 90th floor got hit.  There's still at least 20 floors above that.  That weight pushing down, which is the 90th floor collapse, buckles everything out.  It's fucking silly.  And it looked nothing like a fucking demolition of a building.  No.  I've seen demolitions of buildings.  You hear the charges. 
[00:17:30]  You see the flashes of the charges on each floor.  It looked like a building collapsing for the, you know.  Why do we have to argue this?  Still.  Why do we still have to argue this?  Hey, Dr. Steve, you should call in if we don't get Michio Kaku.  Okay, I will, I heard that he's going to be in at 9.30, and I'll be on rounds, but I'll see what I can do.  All right.  Just snake a tube down our nose.  Right, right.  Dr. Peepers.  I was thinking about the domino thing, and I say, Anthony, great minds think alike, because I was thinking that domino thing myself. 
[00:18:00]  And I think that's a great analogy.  The other thing is, is that this thing collapsed organically.  It didn't just happen in sort of a stepwise fashion.  It's just like, you know, proteins that are created in the body fold organically.  And if you tried to fold them, you know, as they're being produced by, you know, the mechanisms that produce proteins in the body, 
[00:18:30]  if you use a computer program to try to fold a protein, it would take longer than the age of the universe to do it,  because we can't figure out how nature does it.  But, you know, when things happen organically, they just happen this way.  I mean, the damn thing, it didn't fall or break down in a stepwise fashion.  It happened all at once, you know.  And so it just makes sense that it happened at that rate.  And, you know, the formulas out there, I mean, it's just freely of, you know, I learned that my first year of physics. 
[00:19:00]  You know, that was the easiest calculation I've ever made.  So he's educating us.  That's wonderful.  9.2 seconds.  Yeah, but you don't have a TV show.  So, Dr. Michu Kaku has a TV show.  Yes, and so does Jesse Ventura.  And so does Jesse.  Absolutely.  Now, Kaku would be a much better, would have more standing against Jesse.  I don't know about that.  You would hold your own.  He seems like he's not, Kaku's not good with the stuff that, he's probably really good when he talks to other physicists. 
[00:19:30]  Why didn't, but why didn't CNN do this?  Challenge Jesse.  Because Jesse gets to say that, and the whole world sees it and goes, wow, Jesse's making a good point.  Without Larry King or CNN going, no, no, no, no, no.  This is what we got on that.  Yeah, I can see Larry King challenging him on math.  Well, Larry King has no business being on TV then.  Let's get some intelligent people doing those fucking shows at night. 
[00:20:00]  No argument there, my friend.  All right, Steve.  Thank you, sir.  Dr. Steve.  Bye-bye, Doc.  We'll see you later today.  The Boeing, we're watching, Danny, where is this?  It's actually a very good 9-11 debunked World Trade Center's collapse explained.  We've been over this a million times, but it just shows you step-by-step the Boeing,  like, as in a bow and arrow, of the building, because the fire was causing the floors to  sag, and when it sagged, that pulled the outer parts of the building in, kind of collapsed 
[00:20:30]  in almost like a girdle, and then just snapped it back out.  And when it snapped, everything fell, because the fucking, the outer parts snapped back out.  Yeah.  Obvious.  All right, let's say hi to Dr. Kaku.  He's calling in already.  What?  Dr. Michu Kaku.  Oh, hi, Dr. Kaku.  Good morning, boys.  Rape.  Oh.  We're glad you've been listening.  Picture, picture your pregnant girlfriend.  The falling of the Twin Towers is much like when you kick her down the stairs.  She doesn't stop at each step. 
[00:21:00]  She keeps falling until she hits the landing, and then you kick her in the cunt.  Jesus, Dr. Michu Kaku.  It does not sound like something Dr. Kaku would say.  I'm glad you can compare the girlfriend falling to the Twin Towers.  Twin Towers?  Did you have that, Travis?  Please tell me he just said Twin Towers.  Did he say Twin Towers?  Yeah, but he was imitating an Asian.  That's okay.  Please, I want to hear that, just if he just tripped.  Credit to this guy who just called.  He actually fucking righted his way and kept going.  Yes, he did. 
[00:21:30]  I wonder what Travis has to go through to actually get that.  All right, I got it.  Oh, there it is.  It's like when you kick her down the stairs.  She doesn't stop at each step.  She keeps falling.  Picture, picture your pregnant girlfriend.  The falling of the Twin Towers is much like when you kick her down the stairs.  Twin Towers.  The Twin Towers.  It's like we're picking him apart.  It was just, it immediately, all I thought of the whole time he was talking is Twin Towers. 
[00:22:00]  The guy wrote some nice material for us.  There's no W in Towers, mister.  All right, so we got the Jesse thing.  That's very exciting.  You want to do Tiger Woods stuff now or you want to, yeah, let's keep going.  Fuck it, right?  Yeah, Tiger.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  They're coming out of the woods work.  Ha, ha, the girls.  How many girls do you think?  What do you think?  He's been through 18 holes? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, stop it with the golf reference.  Yeah, please.  Yeah, man, please.  I'm sick of the Tiger Woods jokes that are all over Twitter at this point.  Twitter?  I haven't even noticed.  Everywhere.  It's the newspaper headlines that I've noticed.  Oh, do they have a good headline today for this crap?  No, but they're always, you know, with that four-ious, four-ious.  Well, this Tiger Woods thing, wow.  Well, first of all, they gave them what?  A ticket for $164.  So the police are done with them. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Some kind of fine for reckless driving, I guess, $164.  And they're not going to go for medical records or search warrants.  They're done.  That's it.  Yeah.  The big trooper with the trooper hat said it yesterday on the news.  Good.  And then you've got the other broad that's in L.A. with Gloria, what's her name there?  All right.  And she's denying that she ever had an affair with Tiger.  So that allowed this Jamie Grubbs to go, well, fuck that.  I'll take the spotlight. 
[00:23:30]  Jamie Grubbs.  And I guess it's Us Magazine.  Got an exclusive interview with her.  And rumor has it they paid her a lot of money.  And she's got proof that she had an affair with Tiger Woods for, what, 30 months, Jimmy?  That's what she said.  Or that's what they said.  But I think they only met three years?  Over the course of three years.  I didn't see where they only met eight times.  I didn't see that.  That's what I thought I read.  Over the course of time there, they met like eight times and had sex.  And they were texting.  And there's a voicemail. 
[00:24:00]  And Us Magazine is going to have the voicemail later this morning from Tiger Woods himself.  And we all know from listening to Pat O'Brien's voicemails that it's never a good thing to have your voicemails made public when they are of a sexually provocative nature.  I hate this woman.  But then again, she's a woman who's fucking the biggest athlete on the planet.  Of course she's going to save everything he sends.  And you've got to think smarter if you're Tiger Woods. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah, he was thinking with the dick.  That's what happens.  This is the panic I love, though.  Can you start from the beginning, though, Jimmy?  And then we'll get to the panic part?  Because this is all way too good to pass up.  He was a young kid playing golf.  Oh, all right.  You see that?  Tiger had paws all over me.  Oh, get it?  Tiger paws?  At least two more books and beauties have claimed to have torrid affairs with Tiger Woods. 
[00:25:00]  And there's one he bombarded, apparently, with over 300 text messages.  Jesus.  And he warned her last week that his wife was getting suspicious.  He's not a good dirty talker, as you can imagine.  A fucking first, the best black golfer on earth wouldn't be.  I will wear you out.  When was the last time you got laid?  Sexy question, Tiger.  Hot and bothered Woods.  Hot and bothered?  That's what they say.  Hot and bothered Woods allegedly texted.  Why is that? 
[00:25:30]  He doesn't mean he's bothered.  I know.  I understand the hot part.  He's all fired up.  Well, he wants to wear it out.  Yeah, he's bothered.  He's in a froth.  You think he is?  They're lucky I'm not a big golfer.  Norton's text.  So, are your shits normally solid?  I believe it.  I can flip the world on its ear.  All right.  She's a 24-year-old cocktail waitress.  And she said that she had like 20 wild sex romps with him from mid-April 2007, right after she made me to Vegas. 
[00:26:00]  And she said they headed to his room for dinner.  And they went to him.  She'll kick your teeth out.  Yeah, the dad doesn't kick your teeth out.  Draw clubs for everybody.  You golfers really make me laugh.  I can't think of one Mo Green line.  Help me.  I'm fucking sitting here with Mo Green.  All right.  All right.  She said they had it on and off for over three years.  She's on the VH1 dating show Tool Academy. 
[00:26:30]  Ugh.  Yeah.  I'm sure Sam knows about Tool Academy.  Yeah, I'm sure he knows who she is.  That sounds like a show he would watch.  He said her.  Oh, by the way, she said he was hitting her with text messages.  And one recently.  I like to say that he routinely showered her with text messages.  Oh.  Including one recently on October 18th, which allegedly wrote,  Send me something very naughty.  Go to the bathroom and take a pic.  Really, one of the shots of either her logs or her fucking dog.  A little sex thing going on.  Good for Tiger.  But she said he panicked and called her and left a message on her voicemail, 
[00:27:00]  November 24th, the day before the Inquirer story broke.  About another mistress.  That's good.  Saying that she might be on to them.  I need you to do me a huge favor.  Can you please take my name off your phone?  My wife went through my phone and may be calling you.  He allegedly pleaded according to Us Weekly.  So if you can, please take my name off that.  Just have it as a number on the voicemail.  You got to do this for me.  Huge.  Quickly.  Bye.  Oh, no. 
[00:27:30]  I heard this.  I wanted to hug Tiger because it doesn't matter what she puts.  She could put Adolf Hitler as your name.  What do you think?  Your voice is the problem.  Wait a minute.  I have that one.  I understand that.  You only have to worry about that if her husband might be finding it.  But it's like, dude, it doesn't matter if your name is there.  The voice message is there.  The texts are there.  It's too late.  The jig's up.  Yep.  It certainly is.  That's what it says in the court papers. 
[00:28:00]  Yep.  You got to get another phone, buddy.  Did you read the second part of this article?  Holy crap.  Crap.  Last week, quoting unnamed sources, added that Woods also batted an unnamed Vegas marketing  exec.  October 22nd, after he picked her up at the bank nightclub two months earlier, he allegedly  went back to his suite at a casino in Verona, New York, with two women, a blonde and a brunette  on his arm.  He's been fucked.  You know.  Yeah.  It looks like he's been fucking.  This is all that stuff that he's been hiding for a while, I guess. 
[00:28:30]  He's been, you know, the golden boy.  Scandal free.  Pretty much, right?  Oh, yeah.  Tiger Woods.  Where the fuck has any scandal been?  Oh, yeah.  And now just tripping over his dick.  He can't take a step without tripping over his dick now.  A few months ago, the mag said Woods also was spotted in the VIP room of an Orlando bar  with a girl on either side, and his hand was up one of the girl's skirts.  They're killing this guy.  Oh, my God.  They're killing him. 
[00:29:00]  Smell his clubs.  What do they smell?  Right.  No wonder he's been pushing it right lately.  But this is what a piece of shit Us Weekly are.  They really are.  It's like, this is not about, was he drunk driving?  Did he commit a crime?  Now that they know he didn't, this is just about, did this guy cheat on his wife?  And this fucking cockblock society that we are, this cockblock, jealous, build you up  and tear you down society we are, loves to watch this guy catching a beat.  It's not going to hurt him as a gonfer. 
[00:29:30]  Look, he's probably, he might be the best golfer to ever play professional golf.  If not, he's in the top three from what I know about the sport.  It's barely a mite at this point, Jimmy.  He says, let's just say, this fucking black guy comes along.  He doesn't have all the records, but, I mean, it's pretty obvious.  To what's typically a very, very white, elitist sport, this young black kid comes along.  And fucking, he is just the greatest at it.  And this is what they're harping on, like, who gives a fuck?  Who cares, man?  It's so irritating.  But, you know, the country's been like that for years, though. 
[00:30:00]  But I can understand.  We love seeing people just self-destruct.  Magazines don't bother me as much, because they are supposed to be just entertainment.  As the mainstream media putting this on the front page, like it's really news.  Yeah.  The same one's talking about Obama's war speech.  On the front page is Obama's speech on the Daily News.  And Tiger in Trouble.  Yeah, that's equal.  Wow.  That's how they see it.  It's equal.  Meanwhile, second mistress is also named, her name is Kalika. 
[00:30:30]  And the magazine quoting a pal of Kalika said her friend explained to her that Woods wasn't happy in his marriage or his home life and that there was just so much pressure on him.  Yeah.  And there's pictures now in TMZ of him with, what, two bruds?  Yeah.  Two bruds.  You know, when he first hooked up with that wife of his, everybody was just like, oh my God.  Everyone was jealous.  God.  Like, look at Tiger Snag.  The guy grabbed this beautiful girl and then, uh, I don't know. 
[00:31:00]  Uh-huh.  He just, what happens?  What happens?  You knock him up.  You get bored.  Yeah.  Something happened.  Why do you think she married him?  Because he's fucking cute.  Because he's the greatest golfer.  He's probably the biggest high-profile athlete on earth.  That's why he got her.  And I don't know what she's like.  She might be a terrific wife and a great lover, but I know you better be fucking licking him ankles to asshole every night when he gets home. 
[00:31:30]  He was a 20-year-old kid when he became famous.  19 years old?  Yeah.  Where was his preparation for being the most sought-after cock on earth?  What prepares you?  Because he was a golfer.  You know, decent-looking guy.  But when you're playing golf in college, I'm sorry, I don't think girls are lining up to fuck you.  They're fucking the football players.  Peyton Manning was getting the pussy Tiger should have been getting in college.  So now all of a sudden, he's this sought-after guy.  Every beautiful chick wants to fuck him. 
[00:32:00]  How do you not?  How do you not?  Well, you know what, then?  Don't get married?  Yeah.  Fair enough.  It's hard to say, you know.  Yeah, you have that choice in the end.  Prince's father had it right in Purple Rain.  Don't ever get married.  And then a minute later, he's laying on the floor with a fucking rag on the side as he shakes and a bullet in his head.  He shoots himself.  He had it.  One source quoted an email to us that Woods allegedly sent.  Who's the broad with Gloria?  Rachel?  Rachel, yes. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Rachel reportedly had also dated Yankee Dirk Jeter and actor David Boreanaz.  How the hell?  I can't say his name either.  Naga, Naga, Naga.  In the email, Woods allegedly said he had just awakened from a disturbing dream.  I had a dream we were married, and I was leading the tournament, he allegedly wrote.  I came home excited to see you, and there you were in the bedroom getting fucked by Derek and David.  Some part of me thinks you would like that, but now I can't get back to sleep.  My body is tired, but mind awake. 
[00:33:00]  Need an Ambien.  Can I give you my opinion on what a dirty boy Tiger is?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All this does is make me want to hang out with him.  You met him once.  I did meet him once, yes.  He may or may not remember me.  I did not, no.  But he texted me.  He asked me to take him.  Oh, he did?  Yes, he said to take my story out of his act, out of my act.  Boo, Jim.  Oh, that had a...  Oh, no.  What happened?  Oh, no.  Um, that dream, if that's a real text and that was a dream, I think he likes the idea 
[00:33:30]  of her fucking David and Derek.  A little cuckold thing going on.  Absolutely.  Because that's not really disturbing unless you're in love with somebody.  I'm leading the tournament.  He really is untouchable.  He's a powerful guy.  He's the greatest in the world.  Your sexual stuff has got to be different.  It's like female lawyers who like to be spanked.  He probably likes, um, being humiliated on some level or having, uh, women talk about 
[00:34:00]  fucking other guys who are better than him or bigger dicks.  I don't know.  What do you, what do you, obviously he had a very, uh, very strict, let's say, upbringing.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, his dad was...  His dad worked hard.  ...on him all the time about, uh, golf.  Tiger Woods didn't know he wanted to play golf.  His dad told him to play golf.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're playing golf.  Uh, like, obviously he's very good at it.  Yeah.  And, um, now, uh, we see how deep this goes. 
[00:34:30]  I think we'll see how far this goes, see if it affects his, uh, sponsorships.  Because that's like the big, that's where he makes his big cake.  Can you imagine?  Cadillac.  Dude, Cadillac.  Now it's known.  Tiger Woods and Cadillac.  It's him driving into trees.  Sure.  Perhaps on Ambien.  He doesn't need money, though.  He doesn't need money, though.  His wife chasing him with a golf club.  He don't need the money.  Doesn't matter.  He's the first sports guy to make a billion dollars.  Doesn't matter.  He's the first sports guy to make a billion dollars.  Doesn't matter.  I thought Jordan was, but, uh, no, uh, it was Tiger Woods. 
[00:35:00]  The first to a billion.  He doesn't want to, he doesn't want to lose sponsorships.  It's not about money.  It's about his, his, the prestige, his, his, uh, you know, the way he's perceived.  He's always been a guy that, I think he loves the way he's perceived.  Sure.  And now it's like, ah, Tiger, the guy that's fucking chicks and crashing his car into trees.  The good thing is, he doesn't have to play golf anytime soon.  This is, this is the time of year where golf kind of, you know, slows way down. 
[00:35:30]  Way down.  I think they get at least two months off now, maybe three.  I mean, there's tournaments, but it's not the type of tournaments that Tiger Woods would care about.  Yeah.  Um, can you imagine being in Tiger's like mansion right now?  It's just him and his wife and, and they got to know the whole world is talking about him.  Just not being in the same room together, you think?  I don't know.  What, how is that working out?  She's probably humiliating.  I mean, it is humiliating for a woman when everybody knows your husband's, you're, you're, you're home mining the kids and there's specific texts. 
[00:36:00]  Picture your wife or picture my chick or picture your, one text would drive.  Like, imagine how embarrassed you'd be if everybody knew your woman sent a text going, I can't, hey, I, I, I, I'm going to wear you out.  And you're like, oh my God, I remember that night.  That's November 8th.  She said she had to work and you're like, you fucking bitch.  Can you imagine the humiliation of everybody?  Like, so you got to feel for the wife too.  That's humiliating.  Of course.  At this point, you got to think some of this shit's real, right?  Yeah.  My, my guess is that it's all real.  Well, I know.  I mean, we're trying to, we're trying to be very careful because you never know with this shit. 
[00:36:30]  But at this point, you got to, you got to think a lot of this stuff is real.  His, uh.  He's not saying shit.  If, if this stuff was bullshit, he would be ranting and raving.  Can I say, he wrote one little statement on his website basically saying he's human and it's all my fault.  So he was sort of admitting to things without saying much, but.  Here's the most chilling and this is, this is the saddest one.  First of all, I need you to do me a huge favor.  Oh, tiger.  My wife went through my phone and may be calling you. 
[00:37:00]  Ew, boy.  You don't want to have to ever say that.  Dude, his wife went through his, what are you doing keeping your text messages, tiger?  Yeah, she's pretty much a viking.  I mean, she looks good, but you know she could raise holy hell if she needs to.  Why, what is she going through his fucking phone for?  Because she probably don't even fucking other people.  Yeah, but there's a billion dollars at stake.  That's bullshit.  I don't like that going through the phone bullshit.  I don't like it.  I don't like that at all, man. 
[00:37:30]  Look, the bottom line is this.  If I was in her shoes, I would absolutely do it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Especially if you're a married man and you got.  Mr. Grady.  Yeah, you a married man, are you?  It says you are.  You beat your wife on the second hole.  You took a golf club and smashed his windows out.  Guys, we got an O.P. and Anthony exclusive.  Oh, really?  Ian in Toledo wants to admit something.  Ian.  Gentlemen.  Hi, Ian.  I just wanted to give you guys the exclusive that one night in Gurney, I bought crack cocaine 
[00:38:00]  for Mr. Woods and powder cocaine for myself and performed oral sex on him.  In Gurney, was it?  Wow.  Got to say, one of my favorite stories ever.  That's a good one.  The Gurney.  We talked about Gurney.  Yeah, we did.  Very nice.  Let's, uh, the phones.  Wow.  Mike in Austin.  Let's go, Mike.  Hey, what I want to know is, what do these chicks get by going to Us Weekly and the National  Inquirer?  Because once they do that, now they're not going to get any trips or jewelry or whatever 
[00:38:30]  the hell they're getting from Tiger or Jordan or whatever.  And then they're not going to get panked by them anymore because they can't be seen in  the same state.  So why do these girls just want to get their names in the paper for two days just so they're  famous and friends and they're banging every famous rich guy?  Well, I can answer that.  First of all, they're whores.  Second of all, they're looking for a quick payday.  And third of all, they really think that, uh, being in the paper for a couple days a  week is going to lead to some kind of real fame. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  But it's not.  It's quick fame that goes away and then everyone just goes, wow, look at that fucking whore.  You're not thinking like a chick, uh, they, they like having famous pussies.  Apparently that's a big thing for a girl.  Having a famous pussy.  He's famous for blowing someone, I guess, you know.  No, you mean they, they like having famous dick?  Whatever.  No, they like having their pussy be famous for a little while.  Right.  Like my, hey, my, my pussy had Tiger Woods.  Hey, look, look at that. 
[00:39:30]  It's famous.  Pink bronze it and put it up in a museum or something.  Do you, do you, do you, do you, do you treat your pussy better after it gets like, oh,  yeah, you probably, you know.  Celebrities?  Yeah, you probably, uh, uh, give it a nice little, uh, shave.  Yeah.  Rub some lotion on it.  Treat it nice.  Now there's allegations.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Oh.  Alligators.  What, you got more info coming in, Jimmy?  No, no, I, it's, it's, it's in there.  Uh, Chris, go ahead.  Chris, go.  Chris, go. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Chris, Jersey, go.  Oh, Christian.  Christian, what's up?  Whatever.  How you doing?  All right.  This is the deal.  He, uh, changed all the names in his phone, Bob, Mike, whatever, and he called them and  told them to change their name on their voicemail.  So when his wife checks the phone numbers in his phone that she does not recognize, they  just get the number on the voicemail.  He didn't save any of it.  He didn't save any of his texts or anything.  He just tweeted to please change her name on the voicemail.  So when the wife calls, it's different. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, he said, can you take my name off?  No.  She wants her to take her name off of her voicemail.  So when the wife calls, whatever number it is, it's not, hi, this is Tammy.  Please leave a number.  Hold on.  Let me see.  Did I read that wrong?  Oh, could be.  Wait a minute.  Now, if that's, wait.  So then it's, oh, you know what?  You're right, but I.  So then it's just a computer voice going, please leave a message.  Yeah, yeah.  So you don't know if he's calling some sponsor.  I misread that.  Thank you, man.  You're, you're, I stand corrected.  I'm sorry about that. 
[00:41:00]  Bob, I know from experience.  Dude.  Okay.  Now I understand why Tiger would leave a message.  Okay.  He trusted this bitch and she's fucking him.  Not his wife, of course.  He had a lady.  Um, a day before the, yeah, I said, can you please take your name off my, off, can you  please take your name off my phone?  So the wife, Tiger's wife already had the number.  So she's going to call this number out of suspicion.  And, uh, she's hoping.  And she'll just hear the computer voice.  And Tiger's hoping, yeah.  This is a misprint.  It should have said your name off your phone.  Right. 
[00:41:30]  Okay.  So your name off my phone.  Yep.  That got a little confusing.  Now we get it.  What I was reading here, is it said now that a magazine, Men's Fitness, now they're  alleging that the cover he did, it's a very, they said the Enquirer had Tiger two years  ago.  2007, right?  They had proof of some sort.  Uh, they're alleging that there was proof that he had an affair and they covered it up  and buried it in order to get him to do a men's, Men's Fitness, which is their sister  company.  Oh, shit.  The magazine cover.  And Men's Fitness is, uh, the competition of, uh, I think another magazine that Tiger 
[00:42:00]  is associated with.  So this was, when this came out, people were like, what?  How did, how did they get this done?  Oh, so they went to him and said, hey, Tiger, how you doing?  But in all fairness, some guy's saying this could be just a disgruntled employee just trying  to get back at his old company.  They said Enquirer photographer snapped grainy photos of Woods and his alleged gal pal getting  busy in an SUV.  And maybe if you have any friends that want to do the cover of Men's Fitness, you could 
[00:42:30]  ask them.  He doesn't do magazine covers.  How do you, I love Tiger.  Tiger, this is the guy who's accusing him of it, uh, who seems like a real fucking scumbag  with a cheesy smile, um, said Tiger Woods, they said Tiger Woods does not do magazine  covers.  Wow.  Well, he did it.  He did that one.  Yeah.  To get out of, uh, the problem.  I can't wait to hear the tapes.  I'm sorry.  I am just, uh, I am a, uh, a typical fucking asshole that just wants to hear that tape. 
[00:43:00]  I want to hear him going.  The voicemail.  It's going to be on us magazine's website sometime this morning.  We want to hear it.  Everyone wants to hear it and it's fine.  Curiosity is not the problem, but the media who is purporting to be legitimate, that's  what drives me nuts.  It's not the fucking rags.  I understand that's what they do.  TMZ, that's what they do.  Do you watch the insider or any of these shows?  They'll drive you nuts and maybe they could get the clip.  There's, there's a guy that does the insider with, uh, Larry Spencer and, uh, and, uh, what's 
[00:43:30]  her name's on there now?  The one from the view that they kicked off the black broad that lost all the weight.  Star Jones.  Star Jones is on it.  And the guy, someone was making a point on that show, like it's none of our business  really.  And the guy actually steps up and goes, he owes me an explanation because I'm a big fan  and he owes me an explanation for what's going on.  Ew!  What fucking gamble said that?  Can we get the audio that doesn't owe you shit?  It was the insider last night.  Please find that.  And some of the other clips from that show that were discussing this, it was, it was, 
[00:44:00]  it was fucking disgusting TV last night.  People have to convince themselves of that because the reality is, I'm a nosy shit.  Of course he doesn't.  And that guy doesn't, the guy should have said, I'm a nosy jerk off who likes watching  another guy suffer.  Yeah.  That's what he should have said.  He said he's a big fan of Tiger and golf in general.  And for that reason, Tiger owes him.  He only owes you an explanation if there's allegations that he cheated at golf.  Oh no. 
[00:44:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  If he cheated at golf, then he owes you an explanation.  Of course.  But if he didn't, he owes you nothing.  Summer rules, you know.  We got the audio ready?  No.  Yeah, why not?  We're good.  This is from usmagazine.com.  Hey, it's Tiger.  I need you to do me a huge favor.  Can you please take your name off your phone?  My wife went through my phone and may be calling you. 
[00:45:00]  If you can, please take your name off that and just have it as a number on the list now.  Just have it as your total number.  Okay.  You got to do this for me.  Huge.  Quickly.  All right.  Bye.  Cheers.  I just got really depressed.  Oh, that is so bad.  Did anyone else's stomach just sink?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, oh, this poor guy.  Oh.  This is like, I fucking hate this country, man. 
[00:45:30]  This is like the most recognizable guy in the world, pretty much.  Here, Tiger panicked the mistress.  My wife may be calling you.  I hate this broad man.  I hate her.  You know what?  Even though I'm contradicting myself, I'm all over the place.  It's just, I understand that that's what they do, but they're fucking scumbags.  You can't fucking talk about them unless you vote.  Why do we give a shit, man?  Oh, my God.  You know what, though?  I gave a shit about hearing that.  By the way. 
[00:46:00]  I'm listening and just going, oh.  By the way, Tiger voicemail, they're playing at 815 on Fox 5 here in New York.  What is wrong with the media?  I think we're the first to play in the country.  Where's Fox 5 again?  I think we're the first to play.  We got two exclusives in two days.  That was it.  Story of, and I'm sure the listeners are sick of my voice, but story about black professor  punching white co-worker.  Where's that?  Not there.  Tiger voicemail, 815.  You won't be seeing that.  They're teasing the Tiger voicemail.  Yes.  You just played it.  They are teasing it.  Let's play it again for everybody.  Oh, God. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, Tiger.  This is despicable.  Boy, are they going to get some traffic on this site.  This is despicable.  Danny, play it.  Put a little ting in the middle.  I hate the ting.  Hey, it's Tiger.  Tiger, I need you to do me a huge favor.  Yes.  Can you please take your name off your phone?  My wife went through my phone and may be calling you.  What's up, Tiger?  Can you please take your name off that?  What do you call it? 
[00:47:00]  Just have it as a number on the list now.  Just have it as your telephone number.  Okay.  You've got to do this for me.  Huge.  Quickly.  All right.  Bye.  Huge.  Huge.  Huge.  Quick.  This fucking bitch.  Game over, man.  For a hundred grand, you fucking bitch.  Oh, that drives me nuts.  That's what I heard they paid her.  Game over.  It's payday.  Game fucking over.  Is that what they paid her?  I heard a hundred thousand.  I don't know where I saw it.  Yeah, a hundred G's.  A hundred G's.  Wow.  A hundred G's to tell the world you're a whore.  He does sound like a panicky Pete in that one. 
[00:47:30]  Dude, there's a moment in there when he goes, my wife, my phone.  You hear like a, you've got to do this for me.  He is fucking panicked.  Look, his wife beat the shit out of him.  She went nuts.  Come on.  Dude, it's so obvious now.  That's my opinion, but come on.  That whole accident in the golf club and the windows.  People started saying that very early on, but come on.  Now that all this stuff is coming out, she lost her shit.  On Thanksgiving night.  And he was fleeing the house with no shoes on, trying to get away from the situation. 
[00:48:00]  Perhaps on an ambience.  But he's back in the house with her.  That is like.  Because I think even she's, this is what I would imagine a couple of this wealth is looking at.  There becomes a point where they both understand, all right, we have major problems.  But this is damage control.  It's now us against them.  We have to figure out how to control this fire.  Because it's her fucking, it's the father of her kids.  It's her life too.  It's her embarrassment.  It's half her, it's her money.  Believe it or not.  He saved her from going to jail. 
[00:48:30]  Is what he did.  And by not talking to the cops, not showing the injuries, by not giving a report that she clocked me in the face with a golf club, she would have been taken to jail for domestic abuse.  For the night maybe, but it's much more embarrassing for him.  Dude, that's horrible though, for your wife to cart it off like that after you're fucking someone else.  She loses her mind and then she's in jail for the night and has to be bailed out and just, that is a huge scandal. 
[00:49:00]  Now I know why he's not talking though.  Yeah, he knows.  He just knew there's nothing he could say.  Why, I wonder why, if this, if, because he knew, he knew it wasn't one, that he could just calm down.  He knew, yeah, there's broads all over the place.  Dude, if you're worth a billion, if you find out.  Get a fucking hooker, you dummy.  I completely agree.  If that's what you want to do, go get a hooker.  But again, what are they going to do?  Worked out well for fucking Spitzer.  Exactly.  Yeah, I guess you're right.  You know? 
[00:49:30]  Mm-hmm.  I guess you're right.  It worked for three years with this chick.  It worked for three years.  Now let me ask you, if Us Weekly says we're going to give you $100,000, why wouldn't Tiger get the lawyers together and fucking get you a little more?  Counter-offer.  Then you're going back and forth with blackmail money.  No, no, no.  It's fucking crazy.  Not if it's through lawyers.  Like, when you look at, look at De La Hoya.  He had a fucking, an explosive, horrible situation.  He made that go away.  That went away.  Not in everyone's mind, but. 
[00:50:00]  But it could have been worse.  She's a smart girl.  That stripper, there's all these photos of De La Hoya, right?  And then he says, she's lying.  So she fucking sues him for defamation.  There he is with his boxing gloves.  Panties on.  And high heels.  Isn't the Bill O'Reilly thing another example?  Weren't there tapes?  Totally.  We don't know.  We don't know.  We never knew.  But it read like a transcript.  He, yeah.  He, uh, there's something about a transcript and then hearing a voice.  Uh, he apparently, um, paid off somebody.  Pat O'Brien.  We had the tapes. 
[00:50:30]  No, not Pat O'Brien.  Bill O'Reilly.  Oh, Bill O'Reilly.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, yeah.  Bill O'Reilly went through that scandal.  Right.  And, um.  Unscathed.  You know, unscathed.  There was some kind of settlement.  And now it's never spoken of.  You have to settle sometimes when you, especially when you fucked up.  But De La Hoya, that woman was smart because she said he's defaming me and she's suing him for defamation.  I'm not lying.  So he probably paid her.  I mean, that's what I would guess.  And then when there's a legal thing, she can't go talking about it because she's accepted the money.  Right.  And she's breaking a legal contract. 
[00:51:00]  And it's just too hairy.  Hairy damages.  Yeah.  It's, that's what you should do.  If you got fucking six or seven of these chicks or even ten of them, pay them off.  Take the shit from your wife.  You don't lose one endorsement.  Oh.  I wonder how far this goes, though.  I wonder how.  He had a few chicks.  How many chicks is he fucking.  No, he owes me an explanation.  Every stripper that ever sucked that dick.  And I'm guessing there's been some, at least there should be if there wasn't.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I want to know why this Rachel broads lawyered up.  What does she got?  Maybe there's, maybe there's money she's going to get or maybe she really didn't fuck him. 
[00:51:30]  Maybe she's going to actually think there's more money in a lawsuit because she didn't  fuck.  I don't know.  But she lawyered up quick and was very nervous right away.  What's that about?  Maybe she's just not a cunt.  Good point.  Yeah.  This waitress looks fucking, looks dirty, though, man.  She, she looks like a good skank.  Yeah, filthy.  Oh, I'd love to fuck this waitress.  Did she really believe that Tiger was really into her?  Dude, he didn't even say it's me. 
[00:52:00]  Why wouldn't you text that?  Oh, I know.  You could deny that it's you.  Yeah.  Hi, it's Tiger.  Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  Hi, it's Tiger Woods.  I play golf.  I bet what's wrong with you.  It was weird to hear.  It's like, yeah, it's me, Tiger.  Tiger.  That's poor fuck.  I feel, I don't care if he was cheating.  I feel bad for him.  She said that on one occasion they had sex and then Tiger goes, I think you should leave.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, really?  And then this dumb broad goes, that gave me the impression that there was problems at home 
[00:52:30]  and that Tiger doesn't sleep with his wife in the same room.  I'm like, are you that stupid?  He wanted to bang you and then he wanted to fall asleep without you.  He wanted you out of there.  Without you in the room.  There's nothing worse after a load comes out when they want to stick around.  You're like, oh boy, do I have to set a small fire in the closet again?  What do I have to do?  But she's spunted to mean that, you know, they're not happy at home and that Tiger sleeps  in a different room.  Do you know how great it is to be a comic and just be a piece of shit and everybody knows 
[00:53:00]  it?  It doesn't fucking matter.  It's so great to be garbage.  Yeah.  What are they going to come out with?  Jim Norton was nice to me.  Anthony Cumia actually wanted me to be over 18.  What kind of info could they have?  Come on.  I've had my share of scandals that have made the paper.  It doesn't matter.  Who gives a shit?  I'm a shock shock.  Can I say that I've been very lucky, but something tells me that someday the fucking cork is going  to come out of the dike.  Oh, boy. 
[00:53:30]  Just when you finally really make it, you got your own movie or something.  Yeah, I get a deal.  Or a funny endorsement for something.  Here's the voicemail again.  Hey, it's Tiger.  I need you to do me a huge favor.  Listen right here.  Can you please take your name off your phone?  My wife went through my phone and may be calling you.  If you can, please take your name off that.  And what do you call it? 
[00:54:00]  Just have it as a number on the voice now.  Just have it as your telephone number.  That's it.  Okay.  You got to do this for me.  Huge.  Quickly.  All right.  Bye.  Cheers.  Wow.  Wow.  I don't even care if the guy's a prick or if he's a nice guy.  This just sucks, dude.  He's a, you know, especially when he started out.  Young guy.  Wants a little pussy.  Goes and gets some. 
[00:54:30]  Eh.  Problem is, married.  That's, that's a big issue.  That's a big problem.  Once you get married, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, you think you got a fucking, you're supposed  to calm down on those texts and voicemails and fucking.  Well, get another phone, buddy.  Have one of your guys.  How do you have a second phone in your house without the wife knowing?  And if she's going through his fucking phone, where do you keep that other phone? 
[00:55:00]  Doesn't matter.  You have one for business, one, however you have to do it.  And you tell people, because you're Tiger Woods, you can say this.  Say, I will never say anything on this phone through text.  We can talk about anything we want.  I will never say anything that is identifiable to me as Tiger.  Oh.  Never.  So if you say, hey, had the tournament go, I'm going to ignore it.  Tournament what?  It's nothing personal.  I'm not Tiger Woods.  But you know what I'm saying?  Like, you got to sometimes.  He's all bad at it.  Yeah.  I'm not golf star Tiger Woods. 
[00:55:30]  Or he puts, yeah, I had a great, I did very well today at G.O.  And then he puts an asterisk F.  So nobody will know what he's saying.  You know, he has good taste in comedy.  That's all that matters.  Hold on.  Steve in South Carolina.  Steve, what's up, buddy?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Hey.  We've got exclusive news.  How come you ain't playing your sounder?  Opie and Anthony.  Your source for legitimate, up-to-the-minute, late-breaking, fair-and-balanced, hard-hitting, 
[00:56:00]  angrily-accurate news.  That's right.  Two days in a row.  We had the voicemail before anyone else.  Oh, yeah.  Except Us Weekly.  Well, obviously.  Ting.  Ting.  Ting.  They suck.  Ting.  I think more of these will come out.  More of these little verse mails.  Hopefully he wasn't stupid and he just said, hey, Tiger, call me.  Hopefully he was very smart.  You think there's any, like, you fucking bitch.  That would ruin him.  That would ruin him.  It's me.  Me, you, cheater. 
[00:56:30]  Me, you, cheater.  Betty.  Betsy.  That baseball bat, a golf club.  Betsy, a dust bunny.  Why don't we go to a break?  People want to talk about this, so we'll talk about this a little more after the break.  Then we've got to get into the Obama speech.  We've got to get ready for the Jesse Ventura fucking appearance.  Dr. Kaku challenging Jesse Ventura.  We've got to talk about Gotti Jr.  We've got to talk about the homeless shopping spree.  It's on. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  So, lots to do today.  Oh, this is good.  But somebody's freeing up the fact, like, how is this going to change the Tiger Woods game?  Perhaps be a little more like Grand Theft Auto and Tiger Woods Golf 3.  Where you've got to, like, you've got to drive, you know, you've got to do a hole.  And then you hop in your escalator and you've got to run away from your angry wife.  Yeah, and avoid the wife.  And she's bashing your car with a golf club.  You've got to avoid the wife as you're trying to make a 20-foot putt.  Yes.  And then in between halls, you're fucking some shit. 
[00:57:30]  I like it.  Then leaving texts.  You've got to text things.  That's a fun game.  Imagine Tiger just loses his mind and says, fuck it, let's do this.  Okay, let's go with it, EA Sports.  Let's just go with it.  Where every hole has hair on it.  Yes, of course.  Get it?  Yeah, we got it.  It's a pussy.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Jesse Ventura just finished his interview with a local TV station.  Yes.  I guess he's got a few other places to go because we don't have him until 930. 
[00:58:00]  He is on a tear as far as promoting his new program.  Yeah.  We like when he stops by.  Conspiracy theory.  Thermite paint.  Mind control.  Oh, that whole mind control thing.  Geez.  I mean, come on.  Come on, mind control.  You believe in mind control?  No.  I think there's a certain amount you can do.  But within reason, sure.  Well, the breaking news is the Tiger Woods voicemail. 
[00:58:30]  Tiger Woods voicemail.  These dumb local news channels are teasing it.  They're going to play it later on this morning.  Why?  You can't do that anymore in this day and age.  All you've got to do is go online and Google.  I know, dummies.  That means you're telling people, oh, it's out there already.  So they're going to go find it somewhere else.  Just play it as soon as you get it like we did.  You know the people that's for?  The old Bettys?  The people that's for?  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  You're right.  That's who it's for.  You're right.  Oh, I have to wait until age 15 to see that. 
[00:59:00]  But we have it for you right now just in case you're just tuning in for the first time today.  Here's the Tiger Woods voicemail from Us Magazine.  Hey, it's Tiger.  Woods?  I need you to do me a huge favor.  Can you please take your name off your phone?  My wife went through my phone and may be calling you.  If you can, please take your name off that.  God.  Just have it as a number on the voice now. 
[00:59:30]  Just have it as your telephone number.  Okay, you've got to do this for me.  Huge.  Quickly.  All right, bye.  Huge.  Quickly.  Bye-bye.  Game over.  I've got to go.  Actually, that wasn't Tiger Woods.  That was Ted Tiger.  Oh, that was.  Tiger Sheckler.  Tiger Sheckler would be.  Excuse me.  Could you please leave on your outgoing message?  I never had sex with Ted.  Leave a message.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  We're moving on from the Tiger thing, but before we do, this is the stuff I was telling you about 
[01:00:00]  from the insider that will drive Jimmy especially nuts here.  These entertainment shows, you've got to take a peek.  Like, I like watching certain shows just to be annoyed, and this insider's one of them.  I just yell at the TV.  Yeah.  Yell at the fucking TV.  Who is this fucking jizz bucket who we're about to talk about?  No, I'm not a fan of the shows.  I don't watch because I'm a fan.  I watch to, you know, keep up on pop culture and also to fucking hate on these people. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah.  To fucking hate on them.  And then bring it to the attention of our audience, how ridiculous it is out there.  Here's the guy that I was telling you about who's crushed by the Tiger news.  Hang on one second, Nisi.  I've got to say, I am crushed by this story.  I am a huge Tiger Woods fan.  And until his side of the story comes out, until he makes a full statement and comes clean,  I've got to give him just a little bit of the benefit of this.  Okay, what is he waiting on?  What is he going to do then?  Yeah, I don't believe it.  He is a family man.  Here is a man who has been seen going on plenty of stroller walks with his wife. 
[01:01:00]  He has a two-year-old, a ten-month-old, and I just don't buy it.  Especially, I don't buy this woman, Jamie Grubbs.  Oh, Mike, they actually said, I don't buy this woman, Jamie Grubbs?  You dope.  The way they're doing it, too, is like, you know, it's one thing.  It sounds like a bunch of guys to just sit here and discuss, you know, the implications.  I think we've all been in certain situations where, you know, there's been some awkward moments with women, things like that. 
[01:01:30]  So we can discuss it as guys in that context.  They discuss it on those shows like it's, first of all, the most important thing in the world.  And with such fucking, like, they're too invested in it.  Like, I think it's funny as shit.  I'll listen.  Yeah, the girl's a cunt.  He's a fucking, you know, idiot.  Whatever.  But I'm not going to sit there and go, oh, my God.  Oh, Opie. 
[01:02:00]  I'm devastated by this whole thing with Tiger.  It's just, those shows are awful.  I can't, the only time I've ever watched them is when they do promo something that I know we're going to be hitting on the show or something.  Oh, sure.  I probably have watched one of those entertainment shows maybe twice in a year.  It's good fodder for the radio show, I'm telling you, because we could beat the shit out of these people.  Here's the clip I was actually.  Who is this guy?  What's his name?  I don't care.  Fag, faggy fag. 
[01:02:30]  Can we look up who is?  I don't care enough to know his name.  Whoa.  That was cool.  Here's the guy, though.  It doesn't look cute for him, but bottom line is, he doesn't owe us anything.  Star, you're left.  That's Star.  She's right.  She's right.  I don't like enough fucking skeletons.  She's right, though.  She's totally right.  But listen to what the guy says right after that.  Take that.  Ex-fatso.  It doesn't look cute for him, but bottom line is, he doesn't owe us anything. 
[01:03:00]  Star, you're letting him off the hook.  No, I'm not.  I don't let anybody off the hook.  He is a role model.  Yes, you're letting him off the hook by saying he doesn't owe us anything.  He does, he owes me as a golf fan.  What does he owe us?  I just put him on a pedestal for being the person I thought he was.  What do you think of when you think of Tiger?  Star, would you stop?  You sound like an attorney, like a crazy attorney right now.  Stop.  You're a human being.  She's, no.  Star's the only, of you three, Star's the only one that doesn't sound like a cunt.  Never thought I'd say it. 
[01:03:30]  God, I agree with that fucking former fatty.  She's right.  What a pussy that guy is.  He owes me.  Fuck you.  As a man I thought he was.  What, are you married to him, you fucking fruit?  What kind of guy are you, you fucking asshole?  Shut up.  I'm a huge golf fan, and I'm a huge Tiger Woods fan.  I don't feel like the guy owes me anything.  I feel a little bad for him.  I feel bad for him.  I'm a 78.5 fan.  Huh?  Linger longer.  Oh, very good.  So one person got that.  What a fucking, what kind of guy takes that position? 
[01:04:00]  What a pussy.  Hearing the voicemail, I'm like, oh boy.  But that's as far as it goes.  He doesn't owe me shit.  I think he's guilty.  I think he did it, and I still like him, and I feel bad for him.  His job is to hit a fucking ball.  It's a worthless job.  It's fun to watch, but it's a worthless thing he does.  He just seems to be very good at it.  Yeah, he's not a role model.  He's a guy who hits a ball into a fucking hole and then goes home.  He doesn't owe me anything, but I certainly want to know as much as I can about this.  He owes us nothing. 
[01:04:30]  It's pretty interesting.  All he owes is to play golf without cheating to people who pay to watch him play golf and  to the networks who pay to have you.  That he owes you.  Aside from that, nothing.  That's it.  That guy's not a guy.  He's not a guy.  He's not a guy.  Can we find out who that fucking pussy is?  Is that a put-on for the show?  Is that his character?  Nah, he's...  What a cunt.  Why would Tiger owe him anything as a golf fan?  And when he said, for the person I thought he would be, is there any way we could hear  that fucking line again? 
[01:05:00]  Dude, I'm embarrassed of this guy.  It doesn't look cute for him, but bottom line is, he doesn't owe us anything.  Star, you're letting him off the hook.  No, I'm not.  I don't let anybody off the hook.  He is a role model.  Yes, you're letting him off the hook by saying he doesn't owe us anything.  He owes me as a golf fan.  As someone who has put him on a pedestal for being the person I thought he was.  What do you think of when you think of Tiger?  Star, would you stop?  You sound like an attorney, like a crazy attorney right now.  Stop!  You're a human being. 
[01:05:30]  The kind of person I thought he was.  Like this guy, if you're a golf fan, that's fine.  You watch the fucking Tiger play, and it's great.  You put him on a pedestal for the kind of guy you thought he was.  What?  Look, because he's not as wholesome as you thought.  That affects you.  Oh, you pussy.  Oh, what a fruit.  You fucking pussy.  Shut up.  Yeah, that's douchey.  Put an athlete on a fucking pedestal.  How about this?  I admire the guy because he's fucking great at something I enjoy watching him do. 
[01:06:00]  Even when Jeter annoyed me, and I was furious, and I didn't like him, I still would never  have stopped admitting or acknowledging the guy who was one of the...  I stopped watching the Yankees.  I didn't care what he did to his personal life.  Who said it earlier?  I think it might have been Jimmy.  Tiger would owe us if he was caught cheating or something, you say?  If he was caught cheating at golf, he would owe an explanation.  As a golf fan, then you feel like, wow, you owe the sports world an explanation.  As far as this stuff goes, he doesn't have to say shit.  Absolutely.  He owes us nothing. 
[01:06:30]  Exactly.  Fucking, what a pussy guy.  What a fucking, what an entertainment show pussy.  How does that guy go home to his man every night?  Exactly.  Holy shit.  I wish Nick DiPaolo was here.  Oh, God.  That's it.  That would disgust Nick so much, he wouldn't even be mad.  Back, you know, Nick would be the diplomat.  Well, you know, when he's back, that's where we live in, because he'd be so beyond wanting  to cut somebody's throat.  Nick might be up.  If he's up, you know, call the show, we'll play the clip for him and let him go. 
[01:07:00]  Let him go with it.  It's everything that's wrong with fucking entertainment.  I don't give a shit about my athletes.  I just like to see them play the, you know, whether it's hockey or football, golf.  I don't give a shit about their personal lives.  When did we have to start giving a shit about their personal lives?  Dude, I was a Yankee fan.  Mel Hall didn't even let me down.  Mel Hall was a bad boy.  He sure was.  I don't even feel let down by him.  He did his job in the uniform.  When I was a big Mets fan, Cleon Jones, he's another bad boy. 
[01:07:30]  Is he?  He had something going on in the man once.  He was fucking great.  Billy Martin was another one.  He was a bad boy.  You know, yeah, what do you want him for a role model?  Stop.  I like to smack.  You know, the guy might beat me up.  I like to smack his face.  I don't give a shit.  I don't need these guys to be role models.  Oh, I was so disappointed.  Speaking of which.  Michael Vick, speaking of role models, was at a high school in Jersey, I think, yesterday.  Maybe we can find this clip, too.  Oh, yeah.  Doing all the prep for the boys today.  What's he doing?  He's talking to the kids how it's bad to dogfight. 
[01:08:00]  This is his public service.  Yep.  This is his community service that he was forced to do.  Yep.  And you know what?  I'm sorry.  I don't believe him.  No.  No.  He's doing what he has to do.  You know, I understand that.  We've had to read stupid apologies and all that, and we had to do what we had to do.  But to sit here and think that he's learned his lesson?  Fuck no.  Come on.  Come on.  And that's a totally different situation.  And to me, that guy's a piece of shit.  He actually said...  He's a piece of shit. 
[01:08:30]  The saddest part of the whole thing with the dogfighting, Michael Vick was quoted as saying  yesterday that he probably will never be able to own a dog again.  He said that yesterday.  Dogs around the world were heard going, whew!  And they can't even do that with their snouts.  Right.  They could just go...  He was a scumbag.  And then the final part of the argument they had on The Insider last night, just nonsense  TV at its best.  This is a guy who is married.  The longer he waits, the worse it looks. 
[01:09:00]  Shouldn't he do some damage control here?  How can you do damage control when on the cover of a magazine, I hooked up with your man  eight times, and we did the nasty 20 times.  Damage control, damage control.  Damage control is you being honest.  When you blow it, you got a man up and be like, I blew it.  Just 14 minutes away, we have more of his alleged second mistress, Jamie's on-camera interview  about dating.  Music.  I wish a fire would break out in that studio.  Music.  A fire's not fucking fast enough. 
[01:09:30]  They might be able to get out.  Oh.  That should just be...  There's another clip Sam's got to find.  What they're playing is a tape of this Jamie from Tool Academy.  Yeah.  But it's spliced and edited in such a way that it looks like she's talking about Tiger  Woods.  Oh, really?  And then there's a little disclaimer at the end, but most dummies that watch these shows  have to assume that she's talking about Tiger Woods.  And bad stuff, because she's trashing her boyfriend at the time.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  If we can get that clip.  That music behind them talking is like, they're not saying stuff that's important enough to 
[01:10:00]  have a soundtrack to it like that.  That's a fucking John Woo movie soundtrack.  Sure.  That's a Bruckheimer fucking soundtrack music.  And some fruity guy is talking about it.  I was disappointed that Tiger let him down, put him on a pedestal.  You know what Tiger's doing on that pedestal?  Squatting and shitting on a girl.  And yesterday, I got to jump in, Jimmy.  Your impression of Harvey Levin and TMZ had me laughing all fucking day. 
[01:10:30]  Thank you.  Where Harvey just stands there with his sippy cup.  Fucking vulture.  He's a contribute nothing vulture.  He's got his sippy cup as everyone just kind of worships him.  Yeah.  Just kind of a fun guy, you know, sleeves rolled up, making it look like a fun atmosphere.  He's a fucking complete piece of shit, that guy.  He's a complete piece of shit.  Complete.  I'm glad we were dicks to him when he called in.  Good.  Fuck him.  Fuck him.  Contribute nothing.  I basically gave him some credit going, hey, you're not, you know, you're not pretending 
[01:11:00]  to be something here.  You're going after these celebrities.  He's like, no, that's actually not what we're doing.  It's all you're doing, you fucking dirtbag.  You're just as bad as the rest of them.  I just thought that, you know, you were willing to acknowledge that.  I want to thank, by the way, we got gifts I want to say thank you for.  Yes.  We have nice gifts.  We really do.  It's from another DJ here.  She's on the Boneyard from 6 a.m. to noon, and on Octane, noon to 6.  Kayla, thank you.  She sent us these really cool rock icons. 
[01:11:30]  I don't know what they're made out of.  Nice of her.  They're like little figures.  And I got Ozzy, and Ant got Ted Nugent.  I guess the gun guy in.  They're collectibles.  And Opie got Led Zeppelin, because I guess he likes Led Zeppelin.  Oh, really?  Oh, shit.  I got to take it out of the garbage.  Oh, you are fucking atrocious.  Opie has thrown his away, but Ant and I have kept ours.  So thanks, Kayla.  It's nice, and I'm going to put it in my home.  Why doesn't she come by and say hi?  Uncle Ted.  Yes.  Why don't you sit down and put me on a pedestal?  Yes.  I don't know why she won't come by.  Probably because she might have voice track.  I don't know.  A man chased his neighbor with a lawnmower blade while asking if he's seen sling blade. 
[01:12:00]  I just read that.  Steve from Bayshore asking, will any listeners or anybody that we know, I guess, either be  brave enough to send gifts of wine this year?  Oh.  Ah, knowing that wine is a very difficult gift to send, especially to our own Greg Opie Hughes,  who will then go to a website and check the price.  Wine.com.  Everyone knows.  Check that price, motherfucker. 
[01:12:30]  Wine.com.  At this point, I've got people that hand me wine, and you can see their hands shaking.  Like, yeah.  I appreciate all gifts.  I've changed a little bit.  Really?  Yeah.  But you do look for the wine and see if it's, you know.  Well, if you're going to drink wine.  So you're going to drink it.  If you're going to drink wine, it should be good.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm not expecting like $100, $200 bottles of wine, but.  It's something quality.  Yeah.  Over $25.  You want some quality.  On wine.com.  That's my cutoff.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Because that means about $50 in the liquor store.  That's nice.  I was down in a nice bottle of Shiraz.  It was a mix, though.  I'm not a fan of Shiraz.  It was like 25.  It was only 25% Shiraz, and it had some other shit in there.  Yeah, it was really good.  You've got to go cab.  I'm surprised you're not a cab guy.  I like it.  Nice and heavy.  I like a little Cabernet every so often.  Merlot a little too fruity, and that Shiraz a little too kind of bland for me.  No, Shiraz could be very spicy.  That's true.  It's good. 
[01:13:30]  But then, you know.  I need heavy, earthy.  You know what the problem is?  It's like, I'll break out a bottle and just sit there and just fucking, you know, drink  the whole bottle from like, I guess when I wake up at about four, I'll eat dinner, and  then I'll just start drinking until I go to sleep.  You're fucking insane, dude.  And I'll drink some wine, and then you wake up, and you've got to brush your tongue because  your whole mouth is purple.  You never want to drink wine again after you drink too much wine.  No, it was good.  You're insane because I understand drinking beer all day. 
[01:14:00]  I do.  I just don't do it much anymore.  But that wine, drinking it all day, that will fuck you up.  You're absolutely right.  It is the worst hangover.  But the thing is, if you spread it out, and it's just one bottle spread out from like  five until midnight.  That's impossible, though.  Just kind of.  That's impossible.  No, it isn't.  That's impossible.  Did it last night.  All right, good for you.  Just hanging out.  Those wine hangovers, though, for real.  Yeah.  Is there a worse hangover?  No.  For real. 
[01:14:30]  I will absolutely say.  When you get into one of those dinners where you're buying bottle after bottle, and you  realize you just did a bottle of yourself easily in two, three hours, that is a bad hangover.  Beer hangover, much easier.  You ever hit your drunk where it's like your wife?  No.  You ever hit your own drunk where you go like, uh-oh, I think I went a little too far?  We all have.  Like, you'll be drinking, have a great buzz on, you're having a good time, and for some 
[01:15:00]  reason, you know, uh, you don't stop.  And then it's like, hmm, I think I passed that point where I'm really going to be in  trouble tomorrow.  You're always like, why did I have to have that last glass?  It was perfect up until that point.  Last night, like I said, I was having a bottle of wine, it was really nice, just drinking,  and then I finish it, and it's creeping up on midnight, but I had napped, you know?  So I'm like, yeah, I'll go downstairs, grab another one.  And I out loud said to myself, drink water, idiot. 
[01:15:30]  It's midnight.  What, am I going to down another fucking bottle?  Fuck.  I don't know how you do it.  So I went to vodka.  No, no, I went to water.  Vodka hangover's easy.  You drink a lot of water before you go to bed, though.  What are some of those other bad hangovers?  Uh, Jägermeister.  Oh, fuck.  Jägermeister hangovers were horrendous, too.  That might be worse than wine.  Like, the Jägermeister hangover's pretty fucking bad with all that sugar. 
[01:16:00]  The black death, man.  You're so drunk, all you want to do is sleep, but there's so much sugar in your system, you're  like, fuck, just...  When you puke up Jägermeister, you look like something from a horror movie.  It's just blackness coming out of your mouth.  With a nice licorice smell, though, so you're not really reeking up the bathroom too bad.  That was my shot of choice when I was working in Buffalo.  Jäger's always...  I don't know why I say that, too, when someone goes, hey, you want to do a shot?  And I think because I can't think of a good shot quick enough, I just go, hey, give me  some Jäger. 
[01:16:30]  Right.  And meanwhile, I don't want to do a shot of Jäger.  Uh-huh.  We got the clip from the Insider.  One more clip.  Oh.  And then, I promise, we'll move on.  And look who's here.  Hi, Sam.  Well, Sam knows a little bit about this Tool Academy, right?  Yeah, it's a great show.  She, uh, this mistress that's all over the place, and we played the voicemail from Us Magazine  that Tiger left for her.  Uh, she was on Tool Academy.  Yeah.  Wait, did you say great show?  Yeah, it's really good.  Come on.  I've watched both scenes.  I was into the flavor of love and the Bret Michaels thing, but...  Is it the same house? 
[01:17:00]  They used that same house.  I don't know if they used it for Tool Academy.  They just used it for everything.  They started with the Surreal Life.  Yeah.  That's the Surreal Life house, and they just keep using it and using it.  Well, they just...  Every time, the celebrity goes, yeah, this is my mansion.  And you can tell, the kitchen's the same.  It's the same living room with the staircase.  Whose house is it?  It's just, if VH1 owns the house...  Who's making money off of that house?  Well, I guess so, yeah.  They just keep filming it.  Nobody lives there.  I want to do a reality show there, just called Guy Who Lives in the House.  And do nothing. 
[01:17:30]  Just sit around.  Exactly.  Just walk around in my undershorts, my fucking bag hanging out with clothespins on it, like  the guy who got fucked to death by the horse.  This show sucks.  I'd watch it.  I'd just walk around with his balls with clothespins on them.  Just watch Jimmy walking around his house.  Yep.  Every morning, that awful reality show music.  Boop-dee-do-dee-do.  Yeah, well, another day, I'm making my coffee.  The whole episode is me drinking my coffee.  Reading the paper. 
[01:18:00]  I drink my coffee.  Watch Jim drink his coffee.  You know what, dude?  I feel like I'm somewhere with a friend, dude.  You know what?  Boom.  You got your friend.  He's virtual.  I'm on the road.  Got my new website page.  Boom, dude.  Boom.  Boom.  Boom.  Everyone's calling in with their hangovers.  We'll acknowledge Sambuca.  No problem.  Blackberry brandy?  Come on.  That's kid stuff.  You're going back, but you know something?  That's high school shit, because that's the only thing you can find in your father's liquor 
[01:18:30]  cabinet.  That's bad shit right there.  So, uh...  Also, hold on.  What the fuck was the name of that shit?  Oh, I used to drink this all the time, and it's a horrid hangover.  Come?  Oh, yes.  That was it.  Southern Comfort.  Oh, yes.  I'm sorry.  That's okay.  Oh, I hate it.  I love your Steves.  That's right.  Southern Comfort.  Yay.  Was it a bad hangover?  Really?  Yeah.  When you drink a whole bottle.  On the rocks?  Nah, this is...  What do you mix it with? 
[01:19:00]  We used to go upstate to this cabin upstate in Herkimer County.  That's outside Utica.  That's a shithole.  It is a total shithole, but let me tell you, when you're taking fucking, you know, your  high school girls up there, you know, I was in high school too at the time, so not  illegal, but you're taking them up there, and you have an equal number of guys and  girls, and you're drinking shit, and then you just know...  Those are the days where it was like, I don't care what I'm doing right now, I know  why I'm fucking later, and it just like... 
[01:19:30]  Like now, you can go out and fucking do whatever you're doing, and it's like, oh yeah, well  fuck later.  You can't get anything else done, because you know...  Nothing!  You know that's going down.  We would...  The whole drive up there, it was me, my buddy Simo, my brother, occasionally, it would all  depend on who was going out with these girls at any set time, so, you know, I'd go out  with one, and it was like it was a family of these girls.  They were the same...  They were sisters, and their family owned this cabin.  Up there.  There's nothing worse than a guarantee. 
[01:20:00]  Sometimes it was good to not know, and work it, because then at least your mind's busy  trying to figure it all out.  It would drive you nuts.  A guarantee, I mean, I'm not going to complain, but you can't do anything else until the job  is completed.  We'd be sitting there, and of course, you know, like they're cooking some kind of crap  on an old Franklin stove in this cabin, and we're playing drinking games, and some cards,  and, you know, they're talking, and the guys are talking, and the only thing you're thinking 
[01:20:30]  is, the bed is right the fuck there, and I want to be in it fucking.  You've got to knock one out before dinner.  But it didn't happen like that back then.  You've got to knock one out, so then, you know, the recoup time at least gives you time  to think about all the stuff for about 10 minutes.  You're talking like 15 years old and shit like that.  It didn't work like that.  Like, you had to, you still had to work the girl, you know what I mean?  You had to get them to a place where they were cool with the whole thing.  You couldn't just go, hey, let's go in there and fuck. 
[01:21:00]  That would be like, oh my god, why did you just come up here to fuck?  We should, you know, be in a cabin and do the little hiking, and the whole time you're  just like, oh my god, I want to fuck her.  Oh my god, I want to fuck her.  Oh my god, you can't get it out of your head.  Did you ever make cumzies in your pants without the girl touching it?  No, but I didn't either.  I did do one of the worst things, and it was up at the cabin.  It was up at the cabin.  I'm with one of the girls, and I was so fucking worked up, it was ridiculous. 
[01:21:30]  And for some reason, I was denied.  I was denied that night.  See, shit didn't work.  We hadn't had sex yet.  And I took her up there thinking this was the big thing.  So, on that, I think it was a Friday night, didn't have any sex.  Didn't jack off either.  Woke up with a pain that was just ridiculous.  The ache.  Ridiculous.  Second night, she decides, this is the fucking night.  Now, I went through the night before, the whole day, just all horned up, your kid just 
[01:22:00]  fucking balls full.  The second my, the tip of my dick hit Vaglip.  It was over.  I swear to you, fire, civil rights fire hoses.  I was going to say, it's like turning on a fire hose in the yard without having the hose  in your hands.  The only saving grace was, I was so worked up, the hard-on never went away.  So, it took me like three more seconds, and I came a second time. 
[01:22:30]  All right, I'll tell you my comsies story.  Comsies.  It's the Northport Movie Theater.  I was in high school.  Wasn't getting a lot of action.  It was chariots of fire.  Chariots of fire, yes.  I couldn't help myself.  I had a whack right there.  And in the car, in the car after the movie, there was a make-out session going on.  Session.  But not even, it wasn't even like getting crazy yet.  I had such a rager.  Yeah.  And then we started making out that the rager went even more.  And that's all it took. 
[01:23:00]  Wow.  She wasn't even touching anything.  That's amazing.  It was the rager up against the jeans.  And then it went to the next level, and that was it.  And then I had a freaking fake that that didn't happen.  And what do you do?  You got comsies all in your pants?  Well, she wasn't going to.  We weren't going to have sex.  Oh, you weren't going to have sex anyway?  No, no, no.  A little did she know you did.  Yeah, basically I did.  So then you got to kind of.  I'd love to use like.  I'd love to be able to just cum by using your mind. 
[01:23:30]  Mind control.  I want to have mind control, dick control.  Look, I'm not the only one.  Can we do comsies stories after the break?  I would love to.  Let's do it during the break.  And then like, we're making out afterward.  But at that point, I'm like, eh.  Now we're just.  Now this is not leading to anything.  Steve Vermeer.  Thermite cum.  Right.  That's what you had, Ovi.  Thermite cum.  It got too hot.  It was a rager.  I never had that.  The high school rage.  I did a lot of dry humping.  A lot of dry humping back then. 
[01:24:00]  Where you just get on the couch and just fucking.  You never had one that went off without anyone touching it?  No.  That would be great.  And I do want to.  Because that's worked up, dude.  I.  That's fucking work.  That's old school.  I don't have a.  A cumsy issue.  Okay.  Cumsy problems.  Right.  I don't want.  I used to crack it, though, before I went out on a date.  How dare weasters.  Oh, you're looking big-titted monster.  I've been videotaping this girl every fucking day on Fox 5.  But she has no ass.  She won't show it. 
[01:24:30]  She won't turn sideways.  She's a weather girl.  How is she supposed to show her ass?  I know.  That's just it.  But she should know that everyone wants to see it.  Does she have a bunch going on, too?  I can't tell.  She's wearing some black morticia outfit.  Yeah.  God, those tits.  They're nice, right?  They're nice, right?  Yes.  Yes.  Amazing.  Here's today's video.  I don't even know what the weather.  Do you know something?  I've watched her do the weather now, and I have no idea what the weather's going to be.  I'm not looking at her weather. 
[01:25:00]  She's got big and heavies.  Yeah.  They're definitely naturals.  And she's wearing black outfits a lot, because I think she's trying to downplay the big boobs.  There's pockets on her little thing she's wearing.  Could you see her unbuttoning those, and they're flaps, and her tits just stick out?  The ratings?  All right.  She's off the screen.  Well, apparently it's going to be rainy.  Yeah.  Is it?  In my pants.  Yes.  Chance of cumzies.  Chance of cumzies.  Is there not a better word than cumzies? 
[01:25:30]  We'll take your cumzies stories.  All right.  Good.  They're calling it.  We're going to do it after the break, though.  We'll have some.  Yeah.  So, Tool Academy, Jamie Gubs, Grubs, what's her name?  Grubs?  I think it's Grubs.  So, she was talking about her boyfriend for Tool Academy.  The insider takes that fucking clip, and they don't really tell you that she's doing this for another show.  And it sort of makes you think that she's talking about Tiger Woods.  Yeah.  Right now, we have more on Tiger Woods. 
[01:26:00]  His sit-down about Yvelin and their marriage.  But first, what you haven't heard from his alleged second mistress, Jamie.  Her just-uncovered on-camera sit-down all about dating and her love life.  He's the most self-centered person I have ever met.  It is all about him.  Venting about her then-date.  It's the just-surfaced interview from Jamie Grubs, Tiger Woods' other alleged mistress.  It's all about me, my ideas.  During VH1's dating show, Tool Academy, Jamie expresses what she wants in a guy. 
[01:26:30]  I just want him to see everything there is about me and my personality.  See what they did, though?  They are absolutely stretching it as far as they can.  Thank you, Ann.  Legally.  Right.  To try to make you think, if you're listening with Happenier or whatever, that she's talking  about Tiger Woods.  Absolutely.  And the beginning of that, before they play it, you're thinking it's going to be Tiger  Woods.  Yeah, because-  And then they start maybe sprinkling in an explanation.  Right.  I mean, if they-they should have done the right thing. 
[01:27:00]  And up front say, this is from a show, and she's not talking about Tiger Woods.  But there's no fun in that, right?  Oh, look at it.  Wow, he does that fist thing.  How many girls have seen that fist thing?  Oh, how much comes he's on that green jacket?  Comes he's.  Hey, being a golf fan, I'd like to think that Tiger's just fucking nude with just his green  jacket on.  Just the green jacket.  Fucking bending some chick over.  Guys, we got to break into the show. 
[01:27:30]  Bobo-  What?  Has a huge announcement.  Bobo, is it true you have a huge announcement today?  Yep, that's right.  I'm going to be at the tree-  Oh, let's see.  We got disconnected, Bobo.  Poor Bobo.  His phone gave out.  Boy, he was on hold for quite a while, too.  Over an hour and a half.  Yeah.  We're doing a homeless shopping spree.  We decided yesterday.  I guess they've been working on it behind the scenes for like three months. 
[01:28:00]  Feverishly.  I think it came in here yesterday.  Like, I guess we were supposed to pat him on the back.  I was like, what took three months?  Yeah, could we have gotten that a little sooner?  Was my acting good yesterday?  I'm like, you want to be patted on the back because you worked on this hard for three months  to get it approved?  I don't know.  What the fuck?  It's an easy concept.  Shouldn't have taken three months.  The lawyers were a bit iffy about it at first, but the show support won them over.  And I guess there's no changes to the whole homeless shopping spree. 
[01:28:30]  We can do it like we've done it in past years.  Yeah, we just now need, what do we need?  Oh, yeah, homeless.  Yeah, that's one of the problems.  That's a biggie.  Keith stopped by last night.  And he was just shaking his head like, holy shit, how am I going to get, you know, they  give me this much time now to come up with ten homeless people?  Well, we might need help from the listeners.  He's going to be rousting people with his fucking nightstick.  Hey, get up.  You're doing a fucking promotion, you filthy hobo. 
[01:29:00]  The economy's so bad, though, we'll get homeless people.  Jail or radio promotion?  You pick.  You pick which one.  Yeah, we'll get the homeless.  And it's like the Tippy Tom Memorial fucking, whatever you want to call it, homeless shopping  spree.  Do you want to name it the Tippy Tom Memorial Homeless Shopping Spree?  Oh, absolutely.  Yes, he'd be, wow.  In honor of our friend that died.  Who would just give us a great birthday.  He'd be filthy.  Yeah.  So we're doing it.  Are we going to set this date right now or not? 
[01:29:30]  You want to just do it?  Aw.  The Tippy Tom pictures.  Sitting in your seat.  He's sitting in your seat.  Aw, I don't care.  I'm honored now.  That's at CBS, which gives a shit.  Oh, no, that was at the other XM facility.  Good.  By the way, there's a secret reason.  I actually was responsible for getting us out of there and into this building because  he sat in my seat.  I didn't want to even be in the space he was in.  What a hobo.  You guys want to do it?  Here's the date.  Should we just put this date on the calendar and go with it? 
[01:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Thursday, December 17th.  I'm busy.  The homeless shopping spree goes down.  We've got to figure out all the details still.  It's going down, though, for sure.  Because we kind of forgot about it because they really were working on it behind the scenes  for months to the point we were like, I guess we're not doing it.  Yeah.  But now there's, like, sponsorships and stuff, and it'll be fun.  We're looking forward to it.  Yes.  We need homeless people, though.  Yeah, we'll find homeless people.  Suggestions that we should somehow, I guess, exhume Tippy Tom and have, like, a weekend 
[01:30:30]  at Bernie's.  No one would know the difference.  It smells so bad to begin with.  After a few drinks.  He looks better.  Oh, God.  Oh, poor Tippy.  He's in a better place.  Yeah.  Dirt?  That'd be the same place.  Fucking back alleys of heaven.  He's vomiting on God's shoes.  I guess God needed someone to shit in his pants. 
[01:31:00]  You let me in on a pearly gate.  I want to get in there.  Yeah.  The old Penn Station in the sky.  God wanted a pair of golden buns.  Yeah, he walked through the pearly gates with golden buns.  Aw.  So, we'll give you more details, but it's definitely going down December 17th.  What's that?  Three weeks from tomorrow.  Aw.  Yeah.  And I believe it's a mall in Jersey. 
[01:31:30]  Yes.  We're doing a mall in Jersey.  What are you looking at?  I'm spraying, Tom.  It's like I'm macing him.  All of my gas in the money.  Go.  Get away.  Get away.  Go.  Get away.  Go.  Go.  All right.  He's around there.  Go.  You're going to rise.  Oh, my God.  You got to get the money.  No, no, no, no.  He's getting close.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  I don't see no playoff.  I don't see no playoff.  I don't see no playoff.  Anthony has J-Bop on the radio show.  He's got Lysol.  He's got water.  And he's got a...  Oh, he's got a poker. 
[01:32:00]  I don't see no playoff at this point.  He has everything.  Oh, I'm getting all slashed up.  Give me a shower and spray me.  The Windex and Lysol.  Get back.  Anthony.  Get back.  I got to go on the offensive.  It's Windex, too.  I'm going to lay my karate on you.  I'm spraying.  No.  I'm back.  I'm back.  Back.  Hey, whatever you want.  Get back.  Get back.  Get back.  Yeah, that was when Tippi was coming after me.  I told Tippi if he touches Anthony, he gets $100.  I was never a fan of Tippi being near me, is what it was. 
[01:32:30]  I liked the guy from a distance.  The guy was a genius.  But, you know, I didn't want him near me, so I would spray whatever was around, and usually  it was Windex or Lysol or something like that.  The Tippi Tom videos everywhere.  So glad that the Foundry Music logo is part of our material.  Well, it should be there.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Now I'm pissed off again.  Well, it was resolved, right? 
[01:33:00]  What's happened?  It's a long fucking story.  I like how it's bigger or just about the same size.  It's more legible than Opie and Anthony.  And this is well after we had brought that point up.  It was meant to be.  It was meant to be more.  It's ancient history.  But I thought that was going to be fixed.  Yeah.  Hey, why don't we take a break?  So the homeless shopping spree is three weeks from tomorrow.  We'll have all the details, but we're very excited.  So try to take the day off on Thursday, December 17th to join us as homeless friends shop in a mall in New Jersey. 
[01:33:30]  I mean, usually a thousand listeners easily show up.  Easily.  It was way more than that last time we did it.  For real?  Yeah.  I mean, they'll fill them all up.  Huge.  We've just got to get homeless people.  We'll get them.  And people got to remember because they're like, how do you do a homeless shopping spree without Tippi Tom?  The last one we did, we didn't have our two big stars, and it was one of our best ones yet.  True.  We didn't have Tippi Tom, and we didn't have Andrew, who was a big homeless star at the time. 
[01:34:00]  Both we were supposed to have on the spree, and we couldn't find them day of the event.  And it was amazing.  It turned out.  And still was great.  With homeless guys that don't even know their names anymore.  I think Papa Rock.  Papa Rock was there.  Blue.  May he rest in peace.  Blue.  Blue's dead, too.  Blue is dead.  Blue is dead.  Blue is dead.  Slow motion.  You remember slow motion?  Yeah.  Who's slow motion?  He's a big, fat, black guy who just, he was hanging out, I don't know.  Fez Watley, he was a homeless person who was there. 
[01:34:30]  Fez.  That's right.  People were giving Fez money.  He ended up on the O'Reilly Factor.  Yes, he did.  Yes.  That's right.  Oh, shit.  I forgot about that one.  So we're very excited.  So if you could spread the word, and hopefully you could join us if you're local enough to make  the trip.  It'll probably be the afternoon, right?  Yes.  Yeah, we've got to do afternoons.  That's right.  Treat yourself and come down.  Oh, that's good.  Remember?  Come on.  Yeah, and the videos are all over YouTube if you want to check out past homeless shopping 
[01:35:00]  sprees.  Here's the bus arriving at the mall with just hundreds and hundreds of people waiting to  greet him.  Perhaps more than that.  It's like a young Danny.  Coming out of the bus.  Young, naive Danny.  Yep.  Now he's all bitter.  Now he's all bitter.  Full of hatred.  He learned well from us.  It's a lot of pizzas.  With Rich Voss getting off the bus.  Look at that.  Keith.  Wow.  This is star-studded.  People are already taking the day off. 
[01:35:30]  They're already telling their bosses.  Holy shit.  People are already excited.  Yeah, the 17th of this month.  So you have plenty of time.  Thursday the 17th.  Take some time off.  Go down.  It's the afternoon, too.  So you can work in the morning and then just fucking tell your boss that you have rickets.  Yeah, we'll do an old school afternoon drive show that day.  We'll probably do like two to six, two to seven, three to...  I don't know.  We'll figure it out.  Maybe two to seven so we have enough time.  Great.  Plenty of time.  Yeah.  To talk to the homeless guys.  Yes.  And then send them off.  Get them out there.  You have to go down to the mall just to see the people who are at the mall who didn't 
[01:36:00]  know this was happening.  Yes.  That's almost as good as the homeless people.  Oh, they are far out of time.  The people who are just trying to do their Christmas shopping.  Yeah.  Keep listening to the show.  We'll start giving you clues on what mall we're going to be going to.  We like to kind of try not to tell you the mall too far out because we don't want them  really preparing for our listeners and the homeless.  But it'll be in Jersey.  It's in Jersey.  How far from New York City?  Not far.  I mean...  Less than an hour, right?  Well, yeah.  Close enough that we'll be able to start in the studio and then drive there. 
[01:36:30]  So keep that in mind.  Less than an hour from New York City.  Some mall in Jersey will be there on the 17th of December to do the homeless shopping spree.  More details as they become available.  Very good.  All right.  Are we breaking?  Yeah.  Comsy stories next, Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  She turned sideways, but the fucking logo was up.  What?  Right across her ass.  You're not missing much.  I saw her ass.  It's like the fucking logo has more juice to it.  Why can't she turn?  We also want her... 
[01:37:00]  Because she had an ass like a fucking unrolled fruit roll-up.  We were fucking horrible.  Tasty and delicious.  We also want...  We want her to get a makeover.  We want, like, better hair.  Definitely better hair.  And better clothes.  You got a little cleavage action when you hurt this broad.  But she's a little up there.  She's held up good, but I don't want...  Her neck is telling a tale.  She's...  There's two, like, tendons in her neck.  Yes.  Yes.  There's that.  Why are we being picky?  Why do we always have to be picky?  I just... 
[01:37:30]  She's got big and heavies.  Those things are big.  Oh, look at...  Look at that.  The past and the future.  Ah, look at that.  All right, well...  Lady in red.  I have, um...  A big announcement, Jimmy?  Oh, but it's...  Don't give out tickets, because we've got comsy stories right now.  I'm not giving them out now.  Oh.  But Jimmy will have tickets to his Caroline shows later today.  But I have to give out the question.  Oh.  Oh, there's a question.  You can answer it later.  You don't have to answer it.  That's right. 
[01:38:00]  That's right.  Jimmy always gives a question now, and he's giving out tickets.  Yeah.  Don't ruin my comsy stories.  They're not going to ruin a comsy story.  What's the...  It's a film.  It's been out for three years.  Three years.  It's about a brutal sexual assault, which began innocently enough with a spoonful of a fruity treat.  If you know the answer, you get tickets to see Jimmy at Caroline?  Two tickets.  I have two pairs to give away.  Every show except Saturday, early show, because that was given away yesterday.  All right.  Now, later on, we will be asking for the answer. 
[01:38:30]  This is called TSL.  Yes.  No one's leaving.  I like it.  212-757-4100 for Jimmy's tickets to Caroline's.  Well, why pay for it when you can win them?  All right.  Of course.  We'll figure that out next.  Don't be an Anthony.  Is that guy annoying you, Jimmy?  Everybody's talking about the Tiger Woods thing, and there's Jamie Grubbs.  The voicemail was released.  Who is this fucking bug-eyed sissy on TV talking about a tiger? 
[01:39:00]  Sissy.  What a bug-eyed fucking jizz sack.  What does he know about the situation?  I don't know.  He's from Us Weekly.  Oh, he is?  Okay.  Is he?  He probably made the deal with this whore.  This fucking wispy, awful beard.  He has a beard like fucking the pregnant man, or the pregnant woman, or fucking whatever  her name was.  That thing.  That's that creep.  Let's play the voicemail for everybody.  They're teasing it still on some of these news stations. 
[01:39:30]  We've already played it four or five times.  Hey.  It's Tiger.  Okay.  I need you to do me a huge favor.  What do you need me to do?  Um, can you please, uh, take your name off your phone?  My wife went through my phone, and, uh, may be calling you.  If you can, please take your name off that, and, um, just have it as a number on the voice  now.  Just have it as your telephone number.  Okay. 
[01:40:00]  You've got to do this for me.  Huge.  Quickly.  All right.  Bye.  Huge.  Quickly.  Bye.  That's a devastating voicemail.  Does his marriage, uh, survive, Jim?  Yes.  He was fucking on the broads.  What is she going to do?  Do better than Tiger Woods?  Uh, maybe she wants a guy that's not going to be fucking around.  Well, then don't date a billionaire.  You know what?  Don't marry the best on the earth at something.  How about that, ladies?  You want a guy who's going to fucking only stick his dick in you? 
[01:40:30]  Until you are the best fuck on earth, don't marry the best on earth at something.  You make a good point.  What's the date of the homeless shopping spree?  I'm actually Twittering it.  Uh, Thursday.  December 6th?  December 17th.  Thursday.  Thursday.  December 17th.  We're doing the homeless shopping spree.  You want a clip from, um, the 2006 one?  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Ooh.  Uh, Ant, you...  Star-studded? 
[01:41:00]  Ant, you decide.  Voss performs for the homeless on the way to the mall.  Danny, stench is thick on the bus.  Mm.  Tippi Tom, a.k.a.  Big Red?  I don't remember that.  Oh, I think this was the year that, uh, Tippi was a no-show.  Oh, so we...  But there was a Tippi look-alike who looked exactly like Tippi Tom.  Oh, man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Uh, announcing the homeless.  Danny, the crowd at the mall.  I think the crowd at the mall with Danny could be a good clip to, to play for people that  might not know about this homeless shopping spree. 
[01:41:30]  I mean, we encourage our listeners to go to the mall that day and help the homeless  shop.  It's an amazing experience.  People love this damn thing.  Danny.  Dude, this is unbelievable.  I can't even, I can't even estimate how many people are here for this thing.  There's that many people.  It's like a sea of people.  It just never ends.  Yeah, like fill in some of the pictures for us.  When the, the, the, uh, bus pulled up, uh, what, what was, uh, what was going on?  Everybody was just losing their minds.  And you should have seen some of the actual customers of this mall just be absolutely disgusted. 
[01:42:00]  When you guys pulled in, was the crowd chasing the bus?  Were they, um, uh, opening up like the Red Sea?  Well, basically, they were, like, on the side of the entrance.  And, I mean, it was as far, uh, as far as you can see, it was people.  And, you know, it looked like a lot of people, and it was.  And then we looked inside the entrance, and it was just, it was just flooded with people.  Like, it was three times as many people as we thought it was in the first place.  Wow.  So the entire mall, yeah.  It's unbelievable here. 
[01:42:30]  How many people would you estimate?  Dude, at least 2,500 people.  It's ridiculous.  Oh, my God.  All right.  This is easily the biggest one we've ever done.  Hands down.  Hey, Danny, do these people look like the normal shoppers at the Short Hills Mall?  Oh, yeah.  Dude, when we pulled up, everybody started screaming at the top of their lungs.  And this couple of really old ladies, they almost fell down.  I just don't get it.  And then as the homeless, like, got off the bus, what was the feel? 
[01:43:00]  It was actually, everybody was really cool.  They were very excited for everybody to come off the bus.  And these guys are going to walk away with so much stuff.  I mean, just the amount of people here that are going to buy stuff for these guys, they're going home with way more than those $200 gift cards we gave them.  And then last time over there at K-Rock, hearing that bitch say she wanted the music being played.  In the afternoon.  I'll never forget her going, I don't want to give up a day part. 
[01:43:30]  I don't want to give up that day part.  It was Tracy.  Tracy Carter.  We thought Tracy got it, but she really didn't in the end.  I don't want to give up a day part.  But, like, this fucking homeless shopping spree is massive.  The attention you're going to get for the radio show and the radio station in general, you can't put a number on it.  I mean, the media usually does stories on the homeless shopping spree every year.  Some media outlets really pissed off.  Others just reporting on it.  Remember Boston?  They were all over this.  We were all over the Boston media because we did the homeless shopping spree, which is very good for a radio show and very good for a radio station. 
[01:44:00]  Tom, you know what, Chiasano could have backed us.  That was not her fault.  That was his fault because he could have over...  Oh, it was her fucking fault.  He could have over...  It was her fault, Jimmy.  No, he's the fucking...  He was the boss.  He could have said, what are you...  It's her fault for not getting it to begin with.  No, I understand that, but he didn't either because he could have said to her, what are you, nuts?  This is great promotion for the show.  This is the morning show.  Fuck your day part for Friday afternoon, and he didn't do it.  He's got some responsibility in that, but she was the one that was making the decision. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, we want to do an afternoons because, yeah, afternoons is the time to do it because, you know, a lot of people are out and about doing their thing, and she's like, yeah, I don't want to give up a music day part for this.  I know we're talking about homeless shopping spree, but I'll never forget, we all had a staff meeting with Tracy one day, and she gave me a really good piece of radio advice that I'll share with you guys.  Oh, good.  She says, the way that you produce a morning show is that if you guys, the talent, are talking about, let's say, a cat, right, you play a meow sound. 
[01:45:00]  I agree with that, actually.  I do remember that.  Like, her saying stuff about the sound.  How about if we're talking about a cunt?  Yeah, what do we say?  What sound do you play for that?  Her voice.  Ah, fucker.  She really had awful Jesse Ventura hair, didn't she?  Oh, my God.  I was attracted to her, actually.  No, stop it.  All right.  For real?  Yeah.  I will not believe that.  I swear to God, I jerked off to her many, 300 times.  No way.  I swear to God.  No way.  She invited me once to, like, meet up with her and her friends. 
[01:45:30]  I guess it was supposed to be an innocent thing.  Oh, really?  She told me that she, like, sunbathes topless somewhere in Brooklyn, and if I'm not doing anything, I should stop by.  Really?  Wow.  Like, I want to see those big boobs hit the grass on the sides.  Lay on your back and just have them fucking massaging her armpits.  Right.  Have fucking ants crawling around her nipples because they're on the grass. 
[01:46:00]  What do you got, Sam?  I remember feeling that on my balls.  What's that, white fucking keyboard?  What, chlamydia?  What are you talking about?  Down there.  Oh, her hands.  Oh, oh, oh.  I didn't know she was working the flour.  I just saw her hands.  Yeah, I just think of it.  She was working the flour today.  I know.  She probably had less gunk now than she did after she was fucking massaging her balls.  Sam, what do you got?  Oh, I remember the meeting that Danny was talking about. 
[01:46:30]  It was, remember when we did the boiled meat barbecue and we had all those disgusting animals and had to eat them and things?  You mean the listeners?  No.  Take that, listener.  Well, what Tracy thought we should have been doing was, like, when we had a pig's head that we were going to eat, instead of the, ugh, and, like, the almost vomiting noises, it should have been more like, oink, oink.  Oink, oink noises.  Yeah, like the sound of the animals that are being eaten.  Boy, she was really into the sound of animals and stuff. 
[01:47:00]  She loved those animals.  I remember her advice to me.  We all got advice stories now that I'm remembering.  Well, I mean, who knows better how to produce, like, a male-oriented talk show than a woman who used to run a hip-hop station.  Yeah, exactly.  She approached me one day.  By the way, let me say something.  She hated me the most, but the fact is, everybody fucking had problems with you, Tracy.  Of course.  What the fuck?  She didn't like that time you yelled at her because she yawned in studio.  Yeah.  What was I supposed to do?  Yeah, I know.  We're busting our balls trying to get something going for that lousy station. 
[01:47:30]  And the program director, hiding from Tom Chiasano, this is normal, is in the studio on our couch, yawning.  Looking face-to-face with you.  I'm like, what are you fucking doing?  And, by the way, she wasn't yawning because of what we were doing.  She was yawning because the night before, lack of sleep, possibly.  Maybe.  Anthony, what was your advice?  I'm sorry.  She pulled me aside one day.  And because, you know, I like watching television, and I guess she picked up on that and thought I should be watching a show and talking about this program. 
[01:48:00]  It was that show about the, remember that show about the meerkat families?  Oh.  What?  Yes, exactly.  What?  Muskrat Manor.  Muskrat Manor.  I think that's what you're talking about.  Yeah, yeah.  I still don't know.  Meerkat Manor.  I still don't know what you're talking about.  No one does.  No one does.  And I'm looking at her like, why, first of all, why would I talk about this? 
[01:48:30]  No one knows what it is.  And it doesn't fit any show that our listeners would be interested in.  What's the show about?  It was a show, I guess, about a family of meerkats.  Oh.  It's like a nature show.  Now that I got a Google image, okay.  It's like a nature show.  Got it.  But they all have their own personalities because they're animals.  It's like fucking Wild Kingdom or some shit with, you know, where they just keep track  of some of the same meerkats.  My girlfriend used to watch that show, so you would have gotten her. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, right.  I mean, listening.  Oh, oh.  I thought it was that easy.  No.  Tell her you watch the same show and you're in.  Did Deadspin.com just give us an O&A exclusive on the Tiger Woods thing?  Oh, yeah?  Is that possible?  It's not our fucking, it's not our voicemail.  Hey, come on.  And Kevin's like, ADD radio's back.  Sorry.  We're just reminiscing.  Yeah, why not?  Get into a conversation about the shit times. 
[01:49:30]  I don't want to give up that day part.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  I mean, the people tune in listening to the music and I have, it's a, oh, shut up.  Hit that.  That was, I think that was.  Oh, wait.  Hit that.  Okay.  It's not that.  What is it?  Tiger.  I need to give you a huge favor.  Listen right here.  Can you please take your name off your phone?  My wife went through my phone and maybe call me if she can. 
[01:50:00]  Please take your name off that and, um, they call it, just have it as a number on the post  now.  Just have it as your telephone number.  Okay.  You got to do this for me.  Huge.  Quickly.  All right.  Bye.  Cheers.  Wow.  Wow.  I don't even care if the guy's a prick or if he's a nice guy.  Yeah.  This just sucks, dude. 
[01:50:30]  He's a, you know, especially when he started out, young guy, wants a little pussy, goes  and gets some.  Problem is, married.  That's the, that's on Deadspin.  Tiger Woods' panicked voicemail is revealed to the world, it says.  We sound like asses.  We are.  Oh, good point, Ed.  Good boy.  It's the reason we sound like asses.  We're going to bring it home.  Oh, Bobo has a huge announcement.  His phone was on.  Oh, thank God. 
[01:51:00]  Thank God.  Bobo.  Bobo.  You have a huge announcement for everybody.  People have been calling in, asking about the announcement.  What happened?  Your phone crapped out on us and everybody wants to know what this big announcement is.  And go.  Well, anyway, what I was going to say is that.  Let's say hi to Matt in Rhode Island.  Matt.  Poor fuck.  What's up with the fans?  Matt.  Matt.  Matt, you there, buddy?  Good evening.  Hey, Matt.  Happy birthday, Jimmy. 
[01:51:30]  Yes, it is.  Oh, I have a clumsy story for you guys.  Cool.  All right.  All right.  So my ex-girlfriend was giving me road head.  I was driving on the highway.  And I go to her.  I say, I'm going to come.  And she thought I said, oh, I'm done.  So she pulls the dick out of her mouth, lasso in her face, all over her hair.  I'm now on the highway.  How would she not know if you were done?  Were you just giving up on the blowjob?  I'm done. 
[01:52:00]  Every person I've told that story to has asked me the exact same question.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She wasn't thinking, huh?  Very good.  That point of no return is really amazing, isn't it?  It's the best.  The clumsy point of no return is like, I don't know what to equate it to, but, you know, for  the ladies out there.  But it is like a sneeze where you know you're sneezing.  Not one of those sneezes where you're like, am I going to sneeze?  Like, that sneeze is coming. 
[01:52:30]  There's a point where there's no stopping the comesies.  When you get to that point, as you're like beyond the point of no return, if somebody  came in and started killing your family, you'd still come before helping them.  You'd be coming.  That's so true.  You'd still come.  And watching them getting hacked apart while you're just coming.  Oh, God, I shouldn't be looking at this, but I have to come.  It is so true.  There's nothing you can do about it.  That's how a guy works, man.  A point of no return.  Thank you, Matt.  Guys, live from heaven, you're not going to believe this one. 
[01:53:00]  We got a connection to heaven today.  It's Tippi Tom.  Tippi!  Hey.  What's up, Tippi?  How you doing?  Doing good, Tippi Tom.  I just wanted to call and thank you for honoring me with the only challenge for me.  You're welcome, Tippi.  Hey, I want to do a style lift because I give you a pair of gold cell phone when you walk  through the gates, a bottle of water, and a half. 
[01:53:30]  Hey, I'm trying over here, okay?  Boo!  I'm trying over here.  It's starting to sound like the virus.  What's happened?  Well, we don't know.  We don't know.  Now, go ahead.  Finish it, though.  We'll eat you in a car crash, Tippi.  Finish it.  I don't sound like the virus.  Come on.  I'm going to do a golden bun.  Okay.  What else you got?  You do sound like golden buns. 
[01:54:00]  You might need a writer, though.  Who?  A writer.  What?  A writer.  As in a truck with a bomb in it that you should be sitting in.  With that joke in the back.  It's the only thing.  All right, thanks.  Keep doing it, Mahal.  Give me some more time.  Hold on.  Go ahead, sir.  More.  Yeah, go ahead.  A little more golden buns.  I got nothing.  Where's my wig? 
[01:54:30]  Something like that.  God needed a wig in heaven.  I got wig glue.  Got me high like golden buns.  Guys, you're not going to believe this, but the son of Sam is calling our show.  What?  It's been a long time since we've heard from the son of Sam.  David, what's up?  Hey, how are you guys doing?  Hi.  Good.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Mr. Berkowitz.  You're very welcome.  You can actually call me son of Sam, or you could call me son of Milt, which was the only funny joke that, well, I'm talking to three comedians. 
[01:55:00]  You might come up with a better one.  Since 1977, I gave everybody the opportunity to indulge in that.  Wow.  Travis, start volume three.  Oh, my God.  Travis.  Travis is just foaming at the mouth. 
[01:55:30]  What happened?  I don't know.  That reminded me of somebody on a motorcycle, and the front tire has come off.  Oh, my God.  Please play that again immediately.  Thank you, son of Sam.  Fantastic.  We look forward to your next phone call.  Am I still on?  Yes, you are.  Oh, yeah, you're on.  Oh, yeah, okay, well, anyway, you're talking about the homeless shopping spree, and I'm a tremendous fan of you guys, and I always loved when you went to the Roosevelt Mall, and, you know, you got into all kinds of trouble, and then I think the last year you were at K-Rock. 
[01:56:00]  I think you went to the Short Hill Mall.  This is a complete waste of time.  Pat from Monaghi is calling him David Jerkowitz.  And from Neptune, son of shit.  Go ahead, sir, finish your thought.  You actually, you have a joke coming?  He's got a good thought.  Go ahead.  Yes.  Well, you know, I'll try my best. 
[01:56:30]  I'll try my best.  Why are you calling?  Danny has shown the visual of this phone call, which is the motorcycle.  What's the video called again on YouTube?  The motorcycle.  That is a perfect visual example.  It's like Catherine Hepburn on a motorcycle.  It's just called Wobbly Motorcycle Crash.  This is what the Sam guy just did. 
[01:57:00]  We got the visual.  Holy fuck.  Oh, that hurts.  And I want to try to be a comedian, and I'm 47.  Oh, well, you're making everybody laugh.  All right, give us a little something.  Yeah, give us a little material.  Go ahead.  Give me a little something, something.  So, you know, when you guys came to Short Hills, maybe I might reside in that area.  So I was thinking about, you know, Anthony and the fact of how there's like this institutional.  Everybody says that they're not a racist, they're not a racist.  But then as soon as I heard that you guys were doing the homeless thing up at the Short Hills Mall, 
[01:57:30]  I went from being a fan to petrified in the same second.  John from Bayville.  Can I just say that watching this video as this guy talks?  I feel really bad that the listeners don't have a visual element right now because it's just perfect.  John from Bayville writes, Boar of Sam.  Kyle S. from Indiana.  David Bercoditz. 
[01:58:00]  Continue.  The 44 IQ killer.  That's nothing.  Is that any funnier than all the other jokes?  No, this guy's confused.  John from Houston.  It's not John Wayne Goasey.  Wait, Jeffrey, Jeffrey Dumber.  Wait, the summer of boredom is coming in from Tommy and Bayville.  Wait, now hold on.  Let's give this guy a chance.  Sir, you want to be a comedian.  Yes, Jimmy. 
[01:58:30]  You want to be a comedian?  So give us a taste of something.  What would you talk about?  Well, you guys were just coming about, you were just talking about the comsies.  And another reason not to get married is because I have the uncomsies.  Uh-oh.  My wife was finally giving me, it was that time of the decade to get a blowjob.  And, um, I guess that's not funny either.  I thought that was still the setup.  He was waiting.  Yeah, that was the setup.  He was waiting for the reaction. 
[01:59:00]  He was waiting for a big laugh there.  Sir, let me ask you a question.  Who in your life said to you?  Don't call me sir.  Only when I get pulled over do I get called sir.  It makes me more nervous than I am now.  Who's feeding you?  At least you had a joke for that, though.  Who's feeding you these lines?  Your dog?  Oh.  That was pretty funny.  If there's one bullet left in your gun, I have a suggestion.  Jimmy, you said that?  No.  No, sir.  Opie, the one that's not supposed to be funny on the show.  Sir, what? 
[01:59:30]  Opie, the unfunny one?  Yeah, exactly.  Sir, what do you?  That's what I am.  How old a guy are you?  47.  Okay, so you want to do stand-up comedy.  People in your life have told you that you're a funny guy, obviously.  Who's told you that?  Actually, they've told me that I'm not that funny.  Why would you want to be a comedian?  Recently, I've been writing jokes, and I think that they are funny.  Tell me a joke you've written, then.  Give us some material.  Please.  Oh. 
[02:00:00]  Well, now I'm on the spot.  Yes.  I was writing for my nephew, who goes to college, and he does open mic nights, so I was writing  some stuff for him.  He's a lacrosse player, so it was at the time when Duke had that whole rape problem going  on there.  Well, they were raping a few women, and it turned out not to be true.  Okay.  They only fucked her.  They didn't rape her.  But anyway, I told him, since he's a lacrosse player, of course, I'm nervous now. 
[02:00:30]  Is this Louie S-U-C-K?  Tom Kelly from Westchester, PA, is calling him the Zodiac Killer, but it's a lot of Zs.  That's the only way I can explain that one.  Looks better in writing.  Very good, Tom.  Now, son of Sam, tell us about your observation.  My observation was this, that I told him, since he's a lacrosse player, go up there.  You know, it's totally not true, these stereotypes about lacrosse players and athletes. 
[02:01:00]  You know, I was fucking this chick, and I finally ripped the duct tape off her mouth,  and she said, I'm not even reporting you to the police.  Wait, don't tell you, is that worse than the wheel coming off of the...  No, we're waiting for the punchline.  Sir, that's worse than 9-11.  It's worse than anything.  We were waiting for the punchline. 
[02:01:30]  We got a little confused there.  No, continue, please.  Continue, but I'm fine.  Well, anyway, I thought that it was...  Well, you know, there's stupid jokes, you know, obviously.  Well, when I said that, thank God for Chinese, you know, because I, as opposed to my true namesake, 
[02:02:00]  I'm actually Jewish, so on Christmas Eve, thank God for the Chinese, because you can,  the restaurants are always open.  And what I love about it is that you can, like, order a one egg roll and put it on your credit card.  They love those credit cards.  And that's an observation, not really a joke.  Do you feel the cricket sound? 
[02:02:30]  Did the show move on?  Well, there's this other joke.  You want to hear it?  What did I put myself into?  Oh, you know, another Jewish joke is that you go to the movies on Christmas Eve, 
[02:03:00]  and, you know, somebody's got to work it, and, you know, that they're cursing you behind your back.  They've got to stay open for the, for the yids.  We, uh, on Christmas. 
[02:03:30]  Hello?  I actually, uh, know the guy from the Comedy Cellar, and, uh, at that time,  maybe I was performing a little bit better, so I got, I got much more, um, uh, feedback.  But this is good.  This is encouraging.  I think you have to go through this if you want to be a stand-up.  Right, Jimmy? 
[02:04:00]  Oh, my God.  Well, anyway, I was going to ask Jimmy what it's like when, when you have to continue to play  so many different, uh, venues, even after you achieve a, a level of fame,  and, uh, how difficult that is from a practical standpoint.  Come on, come on, come on, guys. 
[02:04:30]  I'm trying my best.  You guys, you guys are killing me.  You're just giving me unmitigated silent air treatment.  What can I come up with that would be funny?  Well, I guess I, I didn't prepare enough material to, uh, to call in. 
[02:05:00]  Uh, it was more of an observation about, uh, homeless people running rampant  than, uh, the Shorthills Mall.  I thought it would...  Get everybody, uh, all interested.  How about Obama sending those soldiers to Afghanistan? 
[02:05:30]  Man, I can't believe you, if I'm still on the radio, that's unbelievable.  But, anyway, uh, I, on a political note, even though Louis Black was there yesterday,  or, yeah, I think, I think it was yesterday, um, I wish we would have, uh, cut and run.  And he should have just got up there in front of West Point and said, uh, 
[02:06:00]  we are, at this moment, cutting and running from Iraq and from Afghanistan.  Hello?  You should have just got up there.  Oh, my God.  You guys are giving me the whole, the whole, the whole show. 
[02:06:30]  Um, yes.  So I think that they should have, uh, they should, that, uh, if President Obama had a set of balls,  he should have stood up there in front of the West Point cadets  and, uh, told them that they're not going anywhere except to the Navy football game  and, uh, cutting and running.  I would love to see two simultaneously, two, uh, split screen of two choppers  lifting off of the embassy in Kabul and in Baghdad 
[02:07:00]  with a couple of, uh, towel heads hanging on by threads.  I did have, uh, another observation that, uh, Anthony had mentioned last week about, uh,  when you played Cartman, uh, singing about immigrants in this water park  because I did go to a water park.  I didn't get that comment in, uh, earlier.  So since I have my own radio show... 
[02:07:30]  Be more funny!  Be more funny?  No.  Boring.  Kring.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  Aye, nigh.  I, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm battling on, I'm, I'm battling on satellite radio.  That's my big...  No, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, did you see that jerk? 
[02:08:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!  Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Jimmy, I would take you  And Anthony  I'm trying  I'm trying 
[02:08:30]  I'm trying  I'm trying  Are you saying that the actual  I hate you  I hate you  Well, we said 
[02:09:00]  I hate you  I hate you  I hate you  I hate you  Is this an invitation I'm ready for this time? 
[02:09:30]  Look, uh...  Boo!  Boo!  Okay, faggot, what's next?  Now you're getting personal.  I'm trying my best.  Ah! Ah! 
[02:10:00]  So to speak, literally.  Can you write? Can you write a bit?  That was only joking.  Good evening, good evening, good evening, good evening.  Try the wine!  Try the wine! 
[02:10:30]  Try the wine!  I got it in first.  I see the awful terrible things in my life and turn it into something funny.  Mom!  Please stop calling me!  Mom!  I love the Lord!  I have to do this now!  Yeah, well, I guess...  Eww!  Eww!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha! 
[02:11:00]  Ha ha ha ha!  Aunt Pond!  Aunt Pond!  Aunt Pond!  As soon as I get home, the first thing I'm gonna do is punch your mama in the mouth.  Well, that's just a typical day.  I'm trying to, I'm trying to, um...  Run my horizon.  Get out of...  Get out of the...  The... 
[02:11:30]  The construction business.  And get into show business!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  I don't want to apologize for the past 20 minutes or whatever the fuck that was.  I could have listened to that for four hours.  Holy shit!  We fucking sacrificed Nick DiPaolo.  He was on hold.  I'm sorry, Nick.  Dude.  I'm sorry, Nick.  If he could call back, that'd be great. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  Well, Nick was listening.  I'm sure he understood.  What do you think?  Worst caller ever?  It's up there.  I'd say yes, and that includes all radio shows ever done anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Worse.  Worst.  I'm sure he understood.  What do you think?  Worst caller ever?  It's up there.  I'd say yes, and that includes all radio shows ever done anywhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Worse.  Worst caller ever. 
[02:12:30]  He was legitimately trying to make jokes, especially at the beginning of the call.  You want to hear the beginning?  I don't get it.  If we hear the first...  The first...  The first joke that just...  The first joke.  Oh, David, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hi.  Good.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Mr. Berkowitz.  You're very welcome.  You can actually call me son of Sam, or you could call me son of Milt, which was the 
[02:13:00]  only funny joke that...  Well, I'm talking to three comedians.  You might come up with a better one.  Since 1977, but I give everybody the opportunity to indulge in that.  Wow.  That is classically bad.  Because he interrupted himself, like...  It's all about timing, David. 
[02:13:30]  And he interrupted himself, and he loved talking to three...  And he just...  He completely just went off the rail.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gone.  That was great.  If Nick heard that, I'm sure he understood.  You know what?  Let's get Nick back on the phone.  We'll have a break, and we'll get into other things.  We got Jesse Ventura.  He should be here within a half hour, so still a lot of radio to do today.  And a big trivia question!  All right.  The phones are just jammed on.  I don't know how we squeeze your trivia question in, Jimmy.  How about anyone from the New York area that has a cum story?  They tell that, and they try to answer the question.  Oh, fuck the cumsy stories at this point.  That one will figure it out after the break. 
[02:14:00]  We'll do it.  Also, I just posted the latest video of the weather girl here in New York with her big  and heavy's on my YouTube channel, Opie Radio, the one we just filmed.  It's up there for you.  Seriously.  Viewing pleasure.  Pleasure-y.  Uh, Son of Sam is back.  You gotta be fucking kidding me.  Oh, let's hear his son.  Let's cut our losses.  Give him one shot.  Jesus.  One shot?  One shot.  Yeah, I'll give him a shot.  Here it is. 
[02:14:30]  Son of Sam.  Yes.  Hey.  Yeah.  Is this Opie?  It's everybody.  You know who we are.  It's everybody.  Yeah.  Well, I heard the critique while my cell phone went dead, so I plugged it in.  But that's great.  I'm actually the worst caller, not only of your show, but of an entire terrestrial  and satellite radio.  But, you know, it's tough because I'm sitting here in my, uh... 
[02:15:00]  Moving right along, Opie and Anthony.  We did announce today that we are bringing back the homeless shopping spree.  We haven't done it in, it looks like three years, which is...  Three years.  Seems kind of crazy, right? 
[02:15:30]  That's insane.  And it's going down three weeks from Thursday, December 17th.  We're going to do afternoon drive.  And it's going to be a mall less than an hour from New York City, somewhere in New Jersey.  Way less than an hour, actually.  But an easy ride for the people that are local.  Actually, you know what?  People fly in for this thing.  Yeah, they do.  There will be a couple thousand people at the mall.  It's going to be great.  They come from out of town.  Keep listening to 202 or 197 or for free.  I don't know how the fuck you listen to the show at this point. 
[02:16:00]  We'll give you more details as they become available, right?  Sorry, my contribution to the show is over for the day.  What happened?  What did you find?  I got detoured.  I was looking for that weather girl from Fox News, right?  Yeah, we're making videos every day and posting them.  So her name is Shea Ryan, I guess.  So we popped it into Google Images, and there's a picture there to the bottom left.  Yeah, and I clicked that, and somebody said, oh, Erin Nicole is a lot hotter. 
[02:16:30]  So I put Erin Nicole in, and here's how this works every time.  I put Erin Nicole in, in Google Images, and a lot of nude chick pictures just came up.  It's over.  Which I'm now just trolling porno.  And you see how that went?  All I wanted to do was look at fucking the weather girl from Fox.  This new girl that's from New York.  Two clicks later, I'm looking at a complete and utter beautiful nudity. 
[02:17:00]  You're in a loop.  Yay!  Yay!  Love the internet.  God, what did we do before the internet?  I was trolling pics last night.  What the fuck site was I on?  Something like it.  Rentboy?  Yes.  Dot com?  No, I went to, I went to, um, I went to, uh, Hairy Red Bush.  Why?  Just fuck around.  Check out something different.  Wait, no, no, no.  Are you into that, or were you just fucking around?  No, I had, yeah.  Let's get into this for a second. 
[02:17:30]  Dude, I'd gone through everything on the internet.  I've seen it all.  So I just wanted to see some Hairy Red Bush.  It looks like their pussy's, it looks like their pussy's rusting.  There was some girl.  I don't like the Red Bush.  There was some girl with big red dreads, and just a giant fucking red pussy.  It was hysterical.  Is there anything worse than a Red Bush?  Oh, I don't mind that.  No, I don't mind it.  Ah, what's wrong with that?  Well, you own one, so it's kind of, you know, silly for you. 
[02:18:00]  But, ha, ha, ha.  Well, I don't keep it all red and bushy.  Well, that's, you know, I, like I said, and I've been in this argument with everybody  80,000 times, and they always accuse me of liking giant fucking bushes.  I just like the natural shape, but very well kept and very, like, fine down to the skin  there.  You've got to help me out, speaking of nudity.  Everyone is fucking tweeting me about that app you were talking about on the show, and  I don't know what it is, because I don't have the, I have an iPhone, but I'm not rocking 
[02:18:30]  the iPhone like you guys are, and people are looking for that app.  It's called TWI Pro.  It stands for Texting While Intoxicated.  T-W-  So it's T-W-I Pro.  So it looks like Twit Pro.  All right.  Twit Pro.  T-W-I Pro is the name of the app.  So now these people can leave me alone, because I didn't know what it was.  I use Tweet Me Some Skin.  That's a fine one for the basic Twitter users.  That's a good one.  Yeah, I like it.  Although the guys don't add cock pictures. 
[02:19:00]  Stop!  What?  All right.  Yeah, I've got to bring something up.  Can't have that.  Tweet Me Some Skin.  It's a lot of sexting pictures, you know, anonymous women want a little fame.  So they, oh, you like that?  Looks like an old Mexican cave.  I didn't say that.  That's ridiculous.  It's hanging down.  I said it's got everything's got to be clipped.  It looks like the entrance to the bat cave.  That's crazy.  I said everything's got, I know it does.  It looks like, it looks like summer in the hills of California when there's fire hazards.  Don't smoke and throw your cigarette out the window. 
[02:19:30]  Dude, do you like that or not?  No, no.  It's got to be clipped.  Jimmy?  It's got to be clipped.  Jimmy ain't going to fucking even get near like that.  No, it's just, no, it looks fucking, uh, it's awful.  Guys, it looks like the mouth of somebody who should be mining for gold.  Yes.  Oh, Gabby.  It's Gabby pussy.  Oh, my God.  No, I forgot what I was saying.  Oh, the Tweet Me Some Skin guy.  Stop with the cock thing.  It's not going to work.  It's not going to fucking work.  It's not going to catch on.  No. 
[02:20:00]  Uh, so many different shades.  It's amazing.  That's what I was looking at.  Like, different shades.  Some are blondish.  All right, hold on.  Some of that.  Let's go to George.  There's nothing, oh, I'm sorry.  Yes.  Hello, George.  Yes.  How's it going, boys?  Hey.  What's up, man?  Erin Nicole is way hotter than Sharon Ryan, or J. Ryan, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, she is.  She's smoking.  She's on Detroit traffic girl on Channel 7 every morning, and I wake and set my alarm 
[02:20:30]  just to see her.  Can we see a picture of her?  Did we see a picture of her?  Oh, my gosh.  She's a beautiful blonde.  She's not, the titties aren't too big, not like Shea Ryan's big titties, but beautiful blonde.  She churns so you can see her butt every time she points out at the traffic map.  I love her.  You think the Shea Ryan, though, where you've been paying attention to the last few days  really takes her weather seriously?  I don't know.  Does she realize that she's got the gig because she's got the big and heavies?  Got to be.  Oh, absolutely.  Does she realize that, though, Ian?  No, she probably thinks she's a professional, and no one's looking at her tits. 
[02:21:00]  They're paying attention to the high and low pressure systems and frontal systems and all  that stuff.  What about this?  This is very borderline.  Thank you, George.  Lean over, and look at this.  Very borderline.  It's very, but it's a gnat.  It's very like, if she's just standing next to the bed looking like that.  The shadowy asshole.  No, no, no.  The asshole's got to be clean.  I'm out. 
[02:21:30]  Asshole's got to be hairless.  Shadowy assholes.  Out.  I know it's asking for a lot.  The asshole's got to be hairless, but just a little bit up front.  No, but see, the problem with that girl is, she's got hair all the way around the bed.  She can't have that.  I know.  It's rough.  Well, well, you know, if you want just the natural thing, just to know that it's there,  like every girl is shaving down to nothing now. 
[02:22:00]  Come on, mix it up a little bit.  Mix it up, girls.  What if every cock looked the same?  Huh?  They do.  Oh, no.  Some are bent.  That's true.  Some got four skins.  Some more veiny.  Some have shit on them?  Some just farted.  Now I'm just looking at disgustingly hairy pussy. 
[02:22:30]  Basically what you said ten minutes ago is happening.  You're done.  It completely went the other way around.  You're fucking done.  I forgot what we're going to say.  Oh!  It's a quickie.  I'm cutting this off.  These stupid Jets.  Sanchez there.  Mark Sanchez, right?  He has a problem with sliding.  Do we have the audio of Rex Ryan talking about this?  I'm embarrassed to be a Jets fan.  He's got a problem sliding, like when he's running with the ball.  Well, you know, quarterbacks, if they do run, I mean, they don't encourage that in the NFL. 
[02:23:00]  That's why Tebow there is not going to be a good quarterback in the NFL.  That's what a lot of people are saying.  He's an amazing talent in the college ranks, and they don't think he's going to translate well.  Does he run?  Yeah, because he does a lot of that running shit.  Yeah.  But the quarterback that does run in the NFL, we all know when the play's just about over,  they do a little slide to protect their ass, right?  Well, Mark Sanchez supposedly can't slide.  It seems easy.  So, the fucking Jets, they got your boy, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, Girardi.  Girardi, thank you.  Girardi, yeah.  From the Yankees to teach.  This is what happened yesterday at Jets camp.  Girardi goes to Jets camp to teach Sanchez how to slide properly.  And they practiced, I think, uh, over a dozen different slides.  Now, I'm embarrassed to be a Jet fan with this info.  Wouldn't...  How the fuck do you not know how to slide?  And wouldn't there be somebody in the Jets organization that would be able to tell a quarterback  how to slide?  Like, what's the... 
[02:24:00]  Isn't there a difference between the way baseball players slide and a quarterback slides?  Well, a lot of the quarterback sliding, you know, it looks like they're just sliding into  a home.  Yeah, pretty much.  I don't know, they kind of curl their knees up and they grab the ball and they fucking...  But can't you get any 12-year-old to teach Mark Sanchez how to slide?  Yeah, slide.  How does he not know how to slide?  When you first start playing sports, you learn that shit.  That does seem silly.  Dude, it was the biggest sports story in New York today and yesterday afternoon. 
[02:24:30]  Yes.  So, Girardi will be teaching Sanchez how to slide.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  They had a press conference basically talking about it.  Lines up full, you know, just sliding stories.  Let's say hi to Scott.  Oh, God.  Danny.  Scott, what's up?  Hi, y'all need to check out Jennifer Gray at KPS in 3-4.  Jennifer Gray.  Yeah.  Weather girl or traffic girl?  She's a weather girl.  Dirty dancing. 
[02:25:00]  She's pretty young and hot.  Well, the problem is she has a very popular name.  Yeah, the trouble is her...  There's more popular people.  Where does she do the news, sir?  KPS.com.  KCS?  KCS, okay.  KC.  KC.  KC.  Goddamn. 
[02:25:30]  KC.  Is that what he's saying?  I don't know what he's saying.  KC, Kansas City?  No, KTBS.com.  Ah, then shut the fuck up.  Wow, Ant.  I can understand them.  Sometimes you've got to fight back with these listeners.  Well, I'm in a fucking truck.  Give me a break.  That's true, Ant.  He is in a truck.  Give me a break.  I hope your break's failing.  You hit an apartment.  It's a break joke.  Get it?  Wow, wow, wow, wow.  Oh, speaking of redheads, we didn't do the kick a ginger thing.  Kick a ginger? 
[02:26:00]  You didn't hear about this?  I thought it was kick a Jew was the thing that got up in controversy.  What was it, South Park doing kick a ginger?  Kick a ginger.  Some students arrived before school.  This happened before school.  And several of them had received an email message that said,  let's make Friday, November 20th, kick a ginger day.  Now, admittedly, I actually know what South Park is.  I have three grown sons who happen to really enjoy South Park.  This was an episode I had previously missed.  So many of the adults involved weren't even sure what this was.  We had no other reports. 
[02:26:30]  But one of the students at A.E. Wright went to the school office in the morning before school to say some students were being chased.  I think it's important to note it was the students who went to the office.  This is a school where the kids protect one another.  And they knew that was wrong.  Shut up.  So these students went to the office.  The administration immediately went on campus.  We had one student report to the health office that he had been kicked.  He had been kicked by several kids.  And he was injured.  The mother came and took him to the doctor and he was treated for a bruise.  That doesn't make it insignificant. 
[02:27:00]  But it also didn't rise to the level of what some had reported, that he had a broken arm or that he was severely beaten.  It did not happen.  It doesn't make it acceptable.  But we also have to put it in the context of what did happen.  We have nine youngsters who are being disciplined by the school.  Some of those youngsters will also have to face charges from the sheriff's department.  Kids are just assholes.  We all know it.  Is this a big story yet?  No.  They said the kids actually went and ratted the kids out. 
[02:27:30]  For kicking redheads?  Yeah.  We did horrendous things growing up, right?  Of course.  We laughed at all the waterheads in my school.  You just make, you got to get through, get through the day.  That's what it was.  What are we going to do?  Kick somebody?  All right.  That's pretty much what happened.  There were some hot, like, weather girls and stuff.  I just put hot weather girl in there.  There's some chick here.  Which one?  But it says mañana behind her, so she's one of these Spanish chicks. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, dude, I swear to God.  She has, like, giant...  Somebody tweeted that to me, and I retweeted it already.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I'm working the Twitter live on the show now.  It makes it easy for everybody.  She's pretty smokin'.  Yeah, they said she's better than the one we're checking out here in New York.  Yeah, that one's pretty nice.  Hard to argue.  That one's pretty nice indeed.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  All right, look.  I'm going back to Drudge.  Just fine.  I'm going back to Drudge Report.  We lost Jimmy.  Jimmy's just on his iPhone. 
[02:28:30]  You're checking out porn.  Where's Jesse?  I just got a text.  This would be a perfect time for Jesse Ventura to walk in this damn studio.  Oh, yes.  I'm using mind control.  I want to hear about mind control.  That's my biggest thing with him, is this fucking HAARP project.  Because this is what is premiere of his show, Conspiracy Theory.  Yeah.  It's going to be about the HAARP project, which seems to do everything.  I still...  Is it a death ray?  Is it a weather machine?  Is it mind control?  It can't be everything. 
[02:29:00]  I don't know.  You explained it earlier, and I still don't know what it means.  I don't either.  I want to hear from him.  What is this?  Do we have an ETA on Jesse Ventura?  It's going to be all defensive, isn't it?  We could do one of our quick breaks.  Yeah, we could do that.  Jimmy?  This afternoon, I'll be on...  I'm coming back here.  What?  2 to 3.30.  What are you doing, Jimmy?  I've got to do press.  I've got to do...  Press for what?  For my gigs this weekend.  You're going to sell all those out.  I've got to...  I'll be on Pete Dominick's show on POTUS. 
[02:29:30]  Very cool.  And Raw Dog, and I think Covino and Rich.  Very cool.  On Maxim.  Those guys are having me so cool.  Right on, man.  And everyone knows by now, Jimmy's going to be at Caroline's starting tomorrow.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday?  Tomorrow through Sunday, yeah.  Holy shit, that's a lot of shows for Jimmy.  212-757-4100.  Is that Jesse?  Let's bring him in, man.  Yeah!  Now we're talking.  We love when Jesse comes on the show.  Of course.  Ladies and gentlemen, Jesse Ventura. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, uh-oh.  How are you, sir?  Good.  Governor Ventura.  I see you've got your SEAL team hat on today.  Always.  You keep the title, right?  Like the president?  Yeah.  Governor Ventura.  Absolutely, yeah.  So the whole time.  You can actually put it on your gravestone if you'd like to.  Wow.  Would you?  Yeah, I'm going to do it.  Why not?  But it was a bad experience for you.  You didn't like being governor, did you?  It was not a bad experience.  I did like it.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Why was it bad?  I mean, I got to meet and do things that I would never...  I mean, because I was governor, I got to sit down with Fidel Castro for an hour. 
[02:30:30]  I mean, who can say they've done that before?  I couldn't have did it without being the governor.  Did you like Fidel's thing?  I thought Jesse was too radical.  You can't...  You know, it's hard to judge...  When I saw Fidel, it was back in 2002, before he had any health problems, and he was right on.  I mean, I'll tell you how perceptive he was.  I had one hour with him, and as I was sitting there, back then I wore a watch.  I just happened to glance down at my watch to see, and Castro immediately said to me, 
[02:31:00]  he looks at me and says, I'm sorry, am I keeping you from something?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And so I said to him, I said, no, but I said, I know I only have an hour with you,  and I said, I have 20 minutes left, and I said, I wanted to ask you some personal questions.  And he said, ask me anything you'd like.  And that's when I asked him about his perception of the murder of John F. Kennedy.  Because I wanted to know, you know, in many of the scenarios, Castro plays a prominent role.  And I wanted to hear it from his side of what he felt happened in America that day. 
[02:31:30]  And he said, I did it.  Well, no, he said completely it was an inside job.  And then he looked me right in the eye, and he says, Oswald couldn't make the shots.  You know that as well as I do.  And he said it was an inside job.  He said the Soviets, he said I was very close to them back then.  He said the Soviets did not want Kennedy dead because their quote to me was, you can talk to this man.  Yeah, yeah.  And Castro said, I didn't want him dead.  He said, do I look suicidal? 
[02:32:00]  He said, if I would have killed Kennedy, my country would have been wiped off the face of the earth.  Yeah.  And I tend to believe him.  Just let me ask you a question, because I was always a conspiracy guy with the Kennedy stuff.  And I've actually begun to not be.  And it's simply through, as technology has advanced and debunked certain bits of conspiracy.  And then they had the 1978 House Select Committee on Assassinations.  I've actually started to think it was Oswald as much as that was.  Well, there's two versions.  The Warren Commission says Oswald did it alone. 
[02:32:30]  The 78 Committee says there was a conspiracy.  So how can you have two separate reports from the government?  Well, they didn't say conspiracy, though, because.  No, they said it was a conspiracy.  But wasn't it because, let me ask you, wasn't it because there was an audio that was left on an officer's microphone on a motorcycle?  And they said that acoustics proved that that was a fourth bullet, thereby making it a conspiracy.  And then later on, they said, no, no, no, that was a different officer's mic.  That was incorrect.  And the medical evidence, like Bodden and them, all said it was actually one shooter. 
[02:33:00]  The medical evidence never came to the conclusion it was more than one shooter.  That's because you're not seeing the real medical evidence.  Well, Humes burned it.  Commander Humes burned it.  Right.  And, no, to me it comes down to this as simple as this.  If Oswald's who they say he was, this disgruntled little Marine private who became a Marxist-Leninist,  defected to the Soviet Union, married a Soviet wife, brought her back here,  got mad because of our policy towards Cuba and killed our president, 
[02:33:30]  well, why would everything have to be locked up in national security for 50 years?  I don't even disagree with that.  Because the point is, a Marine private doesn't know nothing that would affect our national security.  Now, if Oswald was a CIA agent involved in a false defector program with the Soviet Union,  wouldn't they then have to cover that up?  Because, and why is it today that you can't get Oswald's tax return?  Really?  Yeah, it's still locked up.  They won't let you, and I'll tell you why. 
[02:34:00]  If he was getting paid by the government, it would show it on his tax return,  and that would cause people to go, whoa, wait a minute.  This guy was collecting government checks?  I'm not even talking about, you might be right about that.  I don't doubt that there was people who actually knew what he was going to do.  I'm not saying that there was nobody involved.  I'm only talking about the actual shooting, the physical evidence from the shooting.  Have you ever been there?  Yes.  I have too.  You couldn't make the shot.  There's a big tree in the way.  But I think that they've reenacted it.  There's a big tree in the way.  They've reenacted it where you actually, there actually were a lot of guys that pulled off the shot.  Oh, no.  For a long time.  Nobody's pulled the shot off. 
[02:34:30]  I think they have.  Oh, no.  They had Carlos Hathcock try it.  He's the Marine Corps' top sniper.  He ran the Quantico sniper.  What a name to have.  Well, but he was the Marine Corps' top sniper.  He was the head instructor at the Quantico sniper school.  He couldn't do it.  And he has over, what, 98 confirmed kills?  Excuse me.  Oswald had the lowest rating you could have in military shooting.  He was a barely made marksman.  He wasn't even a sharpshooter, an expert. 
[02:35:00]  And you're going to tell me he pumped these three rounds?  And the magic bullet, that is crap.  But they have actually.  It is crap.  It sounds like crap.  It is crap.  Until you see the bullet, it's pristine.  I don't believe.  How can a bullet go through seven people, end up lodged in someone's leg, and it's pristine?  They could solve this simply, but who do you call it won't allow it?  The Governor Conley?  He has fragments in his body.  Let's get those fragments and weigh it against the bullet they said did it. 
[02:35:30]  If it weighs more than original, then that tells you there's two.  I just don't think so.  And it's like, again, it's hard to argue a point that I held for so long, because I really did believe conspiracy.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's not that I want to give up on conspiracy.  It was just that when they start lumping in the Warren Commission and the Dallas police, it's like, stop it.  Again, it becomes too many people.  It's ridiculous.  That somebody would have said something.  There were people actually in the, Oswald was in the sixth floor of the depository. 
[02:36:00]  Really?  Well, who's going to admit to murder?  There was people on the fifth floor of the depository who heard the fucking shell casings falling.  There were people under the floor below Oswald who heard the shell casings.  And they looked up and they heard the shots coming from above them.  Wow.  That's good ears to hear them.  Shell casings.  Damn.  On the wood floor right above them?  That's not that hard to hear.  And you'd know those were shell casings?  Well, they heard shots.  You've got that pristine of an ear to know, damn, that sounded like shell casings.  These must have been combat veterans sitting down below them. 
[02:36:30]  But I think if people sit right below a floor below someone on a wood floor, hear shell casings fall.  Dink.  Dink.  If you hear metal things falling.  How do you know they're metal when they're hitting wood?  How do you know on a wood floor that it's metal hitting it?  Because if you're watching the president and you hear shots ringing out above you and you hear something hitting the floor,  maybe the investigators made the conclusion they were shell casings.  But they heard something above them.  They heard the shots coming from right above them.  And they were in the fifth floor of the depository.  Now, I've got to say, this is the kind of stuff that gets people riled up. 
[02:37:00]  And that's why I have my show.  This is why your show is based on.  Absolutely.  To make people think.  To make people think.  I have seen the ads because I watch the channel all the time.  That's the True TV.  True channel used to be Court TV.  Yeah, I watch it all the time.  And boy, they have pushed that show.  And I love the idea of this first episode with the harp.  Yep.  And what does this thing do?  I'll tell you, it's scary. 
[02:37:30]  I didn't even know this thing existed until a few months ago.  And what it is, it's located about five hours from Anchorage, Alaska.  I had to go up there.  It's out in the middle of nowhere.  And it's a group, okay, regular radio, the maximum you can put out is 50,000 watts.  This is a group of 300 and some antennas that all put out 50,000 watts and they all go together.  So you've got millions of watts going up into the ionosphere, which is that layer right between Earth and space. 
[02:38:00]  Now, what's so bad about that?  Well, first of all, it heats it up.  So could that be global warming?  Could that be part of it, that they're heating up the ionosphere up there by using this thing?  It's powered by five diesel engines that are the size of a locomotive, each one of them.  What do they say it's for?  Now, wait, they call it an unclassified research center.  Well, they're already lying. 
[02:38:30]  Because if it's unclassified, why wasn't I allowed in?  So clearly it's classified, although they're portraying it as unclassified.  Clearly it is.  Otherwise, they'd have let me in.  That is true.  If it's unclassified, why would they care?  And there was also, I have to say, some misconceptions about where the bullet entered the back.  Oh, come on.  There were misconceptions.  Gerald Ford changed it.  Gerald Ford changed it because it got too low.  Kennedy's jacket was higher up on his body than people thought.  No, no, no, no.  Ford changed it. 
[02:39:00]  Ford changed where the bullet hit.  Kennedy wore something.  Yeah, right.  He wore something because he had a bad back.  He wore a girdle, which is why he kind of collapsed and he couldn't just tip over.  And he pulled up.  And he pulled it up like this.  No, no, no.  It was like that.  So it would all fit right in.  But why are we talking about this?  Let's talk about harp.  No, that's one of your episodes.  No, it isn't.  We don't do Kennedy.  Don't you do Kennedy?  Absolutely not.  I thought you did.  He said you next season.  No, we kept everything within the 10-year decade.  Oh, okay.  And that's pretty smart.  We did not do Martin Luther King.  I like the new stuff. 
[02:39:30]  We didn't do anything.  We kept it all within the last decade.  What does this harp thing do?  Well, what it does, what they tell us it does, is that it goes up and then these low-frequency  sounds are then ricocheted back to Earth.  Well, they become very useful in that you can find oil under the ground.  You can communicate to submarines under the ocean.  You can do all this stuff.  And that's all well and good.  But then there's a flip side to it.  It can control the weather.  We did a demonstration of that. 
[02:40:00]  And the conspiracy...  Wait, there's a demonstration on the show?  Yeah.  Oh.  Of how it can control the weather.  Isn't that great, though?  No, it's not.  Because we've signed treaties stating, back in the 70s, all the countries of the world signed  treaties stating if they got technology to control the weather, they would not use it  in an aggressive war fashion.  Now, didn't China already say that they have used something to control the weather?  No, they're attempting to do what we're doing.  They're doing the same thing harp is.  All right, so the treaty went out the window.  No, not necessarily.  I don't know if China signed it. 
[02:40:30]  I would understand if you send heat into the atmosphere, you're going to change the weather.  But it's not as drastic as saying, I am going to, with my weather machine, I rule the world.  Well, you might laugh it off and say that.  But here's the other thing.  All of this low-level sound...  Now, the human brain operates...  All human brains operate on the same frequency.  There's a frequency.  Well, this thing's set up on the same frequency as the human brain.  Do you think that's by happenstance or by design? 
[02:41:00]  Is that the part of your commercial where you go, mind control?  Oh, that one gets me.  They're going to control our minds?  No, what they can do, and they gave me a demonstration on the show.  See, it's written by a Dr. Nick Baggage...  I'm putting tinfoil on my head.  ...whose brother is a senator, U.S. senator, and he does a miniature one on me where there's  a CD player, and then there's this, and there's two wires off it with flat discs that he places 
[02:41:30]  here.  I plug my ears.  No one in the room can hear it, but then he turns it on.  I hear the music, but not through my ears.  Through your shoulders?  You hear it through the front of your skull.  Really?  That's where it sounded like it came from to me.  That's some good pot.  And it's not bone-resonant sound, kind of vibrating?  No, nothing like that.  Well, it gets into you, but not via your ears.  Not via your ears.  Can't you hear radio through your cavities?  It shows how they can shoot these things down to masses of people and literally affect 
[02:42:00]  your emotions with them.  They can cause you anxiety.  They can cause you fear.  They can cause many things like this.  What is their explanation for it?  Is it like riot control and crowd control?  No, they say it won't do any of those things.  They deny all the bad stuff.  But they gave a demonstration.  No, they didn't.  Dr. Begich gave me one.  He ain't part of them.  Dr. Begich?  He's the guy who helps investigate.  His brother's a U.S. senator from up there.  Governor, sir, I just want to ask you about that.  What's so bad about that if they're doing that kind of weird research? 
[02:42:30]  Is that bad?  I mean, obviously you're exposing it, but you're almost making it sound a little bad and ominous.  It is.  When it's like, if they are capable of doing that, why wouldn't we as humans want to expand  and see if we can actually do it?  Well, because things can be abused.  Oh, of course.  Anything can, though.  And this is such a scary technology that if someone abuses it, it could have mega effects 
[02:43:00]  all to the negative.  Scarier than a hydrogen bomb?  All right.  Okay.  Here's what this conspiracy theory is.  The big conspiracy.  Do you remember the tsunami that hit Indonesia a couple years ago?  Certainly.  Do you remember?  There was no forecast to it.  There was no earthquake.  It came out of nowhere.  It came out of nowhere.  Well, here's the conspiracy.  I heard there was an earthquake.  What happened?  No, there wasn't.  The people that were in Indonesia.  Wait, can I just say, no, there wasn't.  All right.  No, because there wasn't.  There wasn't an offshore.  So if we Google that, we won't find that.  Well, the people in Indonesia said, and one of the signs of HAARP that it's fully going 
[02:43:30]  is you see a heavy dose of the Northern Lights.  Well, just prior to this tsunami in Indonesia, witnesses saw the Northern Lights.  Well, you can't see the Northern Lights in Indonesia.  How come they saw them?  And so the conspiracy is, were they testing out HAARP, and it created this tsunami that  later killed hundreds and thousands of people?  Like one of my guys says, oh, come on, Governor, on the show.  He says, you're saying the government would kill all these people?  And I say to him, I'm not saying they did it, but what if they were just testing it and 
[02:44:00]  it got, and the test ended up.  And they fucked up.  Yeah.  And what are they going to do then?  Say, oops.  Oops.  We're sorry.  Oops.  But watch the show.  You be the judge.  You be the judge on whether you think we should be messing with this stuff.  Joe, your damn spots on that show got me hooked already.  I am watching it.  Believe me.  Well, isn't that what TV's supposed to do?  Exactly.  There you go.  That's what I'm going to do when I'm watching that show. 
[02:44:30]  But the one thing about the commercial for the show, too, is you saying you're finally  going to talk.  Jesse, when have you been quiet?  Oh, I'm quiet all winter when I'm in Mexico.  When I live in Mexico, I'm quiet.  Really?  Absolutely.  I live in Mexico.  I live off the grid.  Yeah, we just learned about this last time.  Huh?  Spanish?  Excuse me.  No.  Do you speak fluent Spanish?  That's why you're quiet.  You're quiet.  They wouldn't understand you.  You know?  Who is this crazy giant?  I want to ask Jesse.  He went and saw Fidel Castro, and he said, that's when I used to wear a watch. 
[02:45:00]  Why don't you wear a watch anymore?  Because when I decided after I taught at Harvard in 04, when I got done there, I made a decision  that I wanted to go on and, you know, the window of opportunity is closing.  I'm getting older.  And I wanted to go on an adventure.  And I'm 58 now, and my adventure was moving down.  In Mexico, where I live in the Baja, I live an hour from electricity and an hour from pavement.  That's boring. 
[02:45:30]  And I go, no, no, I surf.  Surfing's a lifestyle.  Oh, that's cool.  Yeah.  All that stuff is cool.  What do you do at night, though?  Sleep.  What you're supposed to do.  Well, I mean, after the surf days, all right, man.  Between the sun setting and time for bed.  I read a great deal down there.  I change my life when I go down there and when I live down there, and I enjoy it.  And it's an adventure living down there.  And it's also an adventure, and I think it gives you better insight to view the United States 
[02:46:00]  from the outside looking in instead of the inside looking out.  You have been criticized by certain people for being less patriotic because you kind of  go down to Mexico and then look at the United States and then criticize a lot.  Well, you know what?  Anybody that challenges my patriotism, let me say this to them.  My father's a World War II veteran with seven bronze battle stars.  My mother is a World War II veteran.  She was a nurse in North Africa. 
[02:46:30]  Your mother wore army boots?  She was a nurse in North Africa.  My brother's a Vietnam veteran and so am I.  How dare someone question me and my family's patriotism.  Every member of my family served at a time of war.  Speaking of which, what do you think of Obama's speech last night?  I think it's awful.  I think we should not be sending those troops.  You are not going to conquer terrorism by that.  You don't conquer terrorism by invading a country and occupying it.  You're creating more terrorists.  They don't want us over there. 
[02:47:00]  So more terrorists because of the hatred of being occupied.  And the point is, terrorism will be won by solid police work.  You saw the last busts here where they got these nuts.  Well, they did that with good police work.  They didn't do it by invading a country.  And I think we should immediately implement the draft because you've got guys going on their  fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh tour over there.  That's ridiculous.  Bring back the draft.  You'll end the wars because then when little Johnny gets drafted and comes home a year later 
[02:47:30]  in a body bag, it'll have some effect on the neighborhood.  We need to implement a war tax right now.  And I was just on Howard Stern and Ben Stein says, you can't implement a tax in the middle  of a recession.  My response back was, oh, so we'll send the young people to die and then we'll also make  them pay for it later because we won't even pay for it now.  What did Ben Stein say to that?  Not much.  Exactly.  Not much.  Well, you know what he is, Jess.  He's a jackass.  Dry red eyes.  He's a complete jackass. 
[02:48:00]  Well, but the point is he's, you know, he's supposedly an economist saying that you can't put a tax on  in it.  See, my belief is the reason we're going to these wars now is because we have a professional  military and nobody in this country is feeling any pain over it.  When you go to war, everybody should feel pain and sacrifice.  And that ain't happening.  We were talking about war and sacrifice a couple of days ago and the fact that during World  War II especially, the whole country got together.  I mean, there were these gathering aluminum pots and pans and nylon and you couldn't do 
[02:48:30]  this.  It's called sacrifice.  Rationing and stuff.  And it was sacrifice.  But for the government, again, to just shove their goddamn hands in everyone's pocket to  finance something, that to me isn't really sacrificing as...  Oh, yes, it is.  It brings it home.  That means every time you spend a dollar, you know a penny of it is going to that war.  You know what, though?  I know that...  Because I pay a lot of taxes.  So do I.  But I know it goes to a lot of places.  The military... 
[02:49:00]  I like a strong military.  Really?  The war itself...  Let me ask you this.  Yes, sir.  Why should the defense budget take half of our tax dollars?  Who are we defending against?  What?  The Taliban's going to invade here like the Marines?  They're going to drive onto the East Coast, drop ramps, and rush our beach?  Well...  You know, why do we need to spend all our revenue?  Who are we defending against?  It's kind of a situation...  You believe Bush when he says they envy our freedom?  Well, we don't have freedom anymore.  They've suspended habeas corpus, you know. 
[02:49:30]  Do you know now they can arrest you in this country?  And they can hold you without a lawyer.  And they can hold you indefinitely without charging you.  All they have to do is, quote, say you were involved in some type of terror activity.  Well, don't they mean some probable cause to say that?  No!  Say that?  No!  What terror...  No!  So, I'm walking down the street...  They can arrest you?  What would they say was my terrorist activity?  They don't have to say anything.  Really?  Yep.  Because they suspended habeas corpus during the Bush administration because of, quote, the war on terror. 
[02:50:00]  Well, guess what?  The terrorists are winning.  You know why?  They're changing our country, aren't they?  Well, they have.  And that's what they want to do.  And we're falling victim to it.  But if we didn't change, if we didn't change, we then would have just been complacent and  waited for some other attack, which I know you have the issue.  Okay, wait a minute.  I know your issues with the attack.  Let me give you a statistic.  Let me give you a statistic.  Yes, sir.  In the last 50 years, statistically, more people have died in their bathtub than in active  terrorism. 
[02:50:30]  But you're talking about when you are jumping out the 90th floor.  So what we need now is a Department of Bathtub Security.  But recent history.  We need to get out there and we need to judge what time of the month that most people die  in the bathtub.  Then we can have it color-coded so that you'll know December is a bad time of the year.  Watch out in the bathtub.  Governor, I know.  And you know what else?  Wait, wait, wait.  We can suspend, too, and have guys come into your house without warrants to see if your  bathtub's equipped with all the proper stuff to protect you.  That's like saying more people have died in nuclear accidents in the past 1,000 years in, 
[02:51:00]  you know, the past 50 years.  In 1,000 years, more people have died in nuclear accidents in the last 50.  Well, obviously, nothing was going on.  It's like I've told people.  I've told people.  You have about as much chance of being hit by a terrorist as you do winning the Powerball.  Yeah, but it's...  What about the people that got hit with them?  No, someone wins.  We should spend all our money.  And we should take away all our... 
[02:51:30]  See, here's my belief.  I would rather face the terrorists than lose my freedoms.  That's one thing I'm willing to do.  But that's a viable argument to make.  The other one is, though, we've never done well as a country when our military has been  decimated.  Carter administration.  We were the laughingstock of the world at that time because the military budget was cut  so badly until Reagan got in and, again, brought us up to the power that this country was in. 
[02:52:00]  How do you giggle at me?  He's laughing at you, Anthony.  How do you giggle at me, sir?  I'm smiling at you.  He's laughing at you.  Why are you laughing at Anthony?  Why do you think an America that is...  So during Carter administration, we didn't have the ability to blow up the world?  Of course we did, but no one uses...  Yes, gee.  No one...  Gee.  And we could blow it up how many times over?  Atomic War was the ultimate.  I'm talking conventional.  We don't sit there and go, hey, watch it.  I'm going to nuke you.  Who attacked us during the Carter time that we needed conventional warfare? 
[02:52:30]  I ran through proxy.  Oh, the Iranians overran our embassy.  Yeah, the Iranians...  Well, let's remember what Reagan did.  Yes.  Reagan in Lebanon, 270 of our Marines got killed, and what did he do?  He cut and ran.  He pulled us out.  The great Ronald Reagan, the hero of all Republicans, cut and ran.  Yeah.  Because 270 of our Marines got killed in Lebanon by a truck bomb.  And he said, these people are crazy.  We're getting out here.  I give Ronald Reagan credit. 
[02:53:00]  He was smart.  He got us the hell out of there.  Well, let me ask you.  I don't remember.  Why was the U.S. in Lebanon at that time?  Why are we anywhere?  Because we're the policemen of the world.  Well, I agree.  That's why.  But did he pull us out of Lebanon because...  Because it was so volatile.  Because 270 Marines got killed, and he didn't want any more getting killed.  Or was he there for a reason, like the quote unquote, to watch out, but certain things  didn't happen, and they just went, fuck them, pull the troops out, let them do whatever  they want to do.  He thought it was a no-win situation.  It was a no-win situation. 
[02:53:30]  270 of Marines get killed, and the great Ronald Reagan cut and ran.  How does Republicans swallow that?  That their hero actually cut and ran.  But I agree with him.  He was smart.  As you said, you assess the situation and go, there is no way to win this.  And there's no way to win Afghanistan.  I got news for you.  The English couldn't.  The Russians couldn't.  I think they're...  This is the new Vietnam, because we're propping up an unpopular government, just like we did  in Vietnam.  Very horribly corrupt government.  Yes, and we're propping them up, and we're sending... 
[02:54:00]  And they tell you this isn't Vietnam?  I don't...  Yes, it is.  I don't think in 18 months they're going to be able to train and get a corrupt government,  by the way, whose president was illegally voted in, to organize and fight...  Here's one for you.  In Vietnam, we never allowed free elections.  You know why?  Because Ho Chi Minh would have won.  Ho Chi Minh would have won by a landslide.  Yeah.  And see, that would have said, well, what are we here for then?  The people want ho. 
[02:54:30]  Why are we here?  Same thing in Afghanistan.  We're propping up an unpopular government, and guys are going to die over there, and in  the end, what will we have accomplished?  But at the time, the mindset was the domino theory.  That's what it was back then.  And the mindset was communism was going to...  If we didn't snip it in the bus...  Now, I understand.  Believe me, you're not going to get an argument out of me that that was a fucked up war to  even go into.  So are these.  I understand.  I agree with you.  I agree with you on that.  What do we do to protect ourselves from people that do despise this nation and want to do 
[02:55:00]  its public harm in the trains, planes?  You do it with vigilant police work here within our country.  But then the civil liberties groups say that you're overstepping your bounds by taking  away the civil liberties.  If the cops come too hard, well, the profiling, you can't profile because we're Arab Americans.  It's like you get into that quandary where if you...  I agree with you.  Well, then it's better.  Let's take away our freedoms, and we'll all be safe.  That is a balance. 
[02:55:30]  What do you do?  It's a real question, though.  They did that in Nazi Germany, too.  Jesse, it's a real question.  It's a real question.  The trains ran on time.  It's a real question, though.  What do you do?  I agree with you.  Vigilant police work.  What do you do?  You're just vigilant.  And again, I'd rather face the terrorists than lose my freedoms.  But somebody on the 90th floor of the towers might not feel that way when a plane has hit  the building.  It's not like a military coming in.  There are citizens who are assimilating, behaving like your neighbor.  Well, is invading a country going to solve this and occupying it?  Iraq, no.  Afghanistan is different, I think, because, fuck, look, they were the ones harboring 
[02:56:00]  bin Laden.  We said, give us bin Laden or we're going to come in.  Right.  They refused to give up bin Laden.  No, no, no, no, they didn't.  Here's what they said.  They said, charge him and we'll turn him over.  We have never charged bin Laden.  How come we haven't convened the grand jury?  The government put forth their evidence and indicted him.  That's what the Taliban said.  Charge him and we'll turn him over.  We refuse to charge him.  Why?  Why is that?  We have convicted him.  What do you think?  We have convicted him before even indicting him. 
[02:56:30]  How do you convict someone and put a bounty on him without indicting him?  I think that it would look bad if we were giving him due process.  Why?  Because he's not.  We're a country of the rule of law.  First of all, he wasn't even in the United States.  Never mind a citizen.  It took place here.  It took place in our country.  The crime did.  But he shouldn't be afforded.  No, he didn't.  Of course he has.  The AP said no.  He has not said no. 
[02:57:00]  Yes, he did.  No, he's not.  Alzo Ahari has said they did it.  He has said they did it.  Alzo Ahari, come on.  Oh, yeah.  And they got the guy down there and waterboarded him 180 times.  I got news for you, pal.  Let me waterboard you and I'll get you to confess to it.  No, you won't.  Yes, you will.  Because I'll just cry and you'll feel guilty and you'll stop waterboarding.  The 180 waterboardings they did to this guy, 180 times they tortured him.  So you think Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is an innocent man?  No.  Stop it.  But you stop it.  Didn't Charles Manson get his Miranda rights read? 
[02:57:30]  Yes, he did.  Well, we can't get him because the fucking Taliban wouldn't give him to us.  Had the Taliban given him to us, I wish we would have read his law.  If we'd have charged him, they'd have given him to us.  Do you really believe that?  They're fucking, they gather up arms for everybody.  They're chopping off clits and they're going to follow our due process of law.  That's silly.  Why didn't we charge him?  I honestly don't know what that process was.  I don't know.  I'm not going to give you a phony answer.  I don't know.  I think it shows a weakness as that we're going to afford this guy the liberties that  an American citizen gets.  No, no.  Everybody gets it. 
[02:58:00]  You don't have to be American citizen.  You're telling me that if a European tourist comes here.  Wait.  Okay.  If a European tourist comes here and they think he broke the law, we can take him inside,  waterboard him, we can do all this to him because they're not a citizen, so therefore our rules  of our country don't apply to them.  It applies to everybody.  When it's considered an act of war, I believe it's different.  No, it isn't.  I do believe that it would be different.  These guys aren't an army.  What country do they represent?  Well, that's exactly it. 
[02:58:30]  That's the point.  They were being hidden by the Taliban.  Exactly.  They need to be done in civil court because they're not military.  So we should have went through a civil court proceeding for a guy who just killed 3,000  of us.  Come on.  It doesn't make sense.  It doesn't make sense.  Who decides that?  He was in a way the country.  Oh, you guys all decide.  Well, we'll give Miranda to this guy, but we won't do Miranda to this thing.  Maybe they would have Mirandized him had the Taliban given him over.  You know, maybe they would have Mirandized him had the Taliban given him to us.  If you're going to be a country that lives by the rule of law, then you have to accept 
[02:59:00]  the rule of law even when it's inconvenient.  As they said, the Constitution is not a suicide pact.  It's not a pact to say we're going to allow people just to come in and do whatever they  want and hide behind loopholes in the law or things they see as loopholes in the law.  It's not a suicide pact.  Miranda's a loophole?  I'm not saying that.  But I'm saying...  Yeah, you are.  You're saying that Bin Laden's still free because we didn't rate him as fucking Miranda rights?  No.  That doesn't make sense.  I'm saying he's...  Well, how about the latest...  They would not have given him up, Jesse.  Do you want the latest one? 
[02:59:30]  Remember when we had him cornered at Tora Bora and they let him out?  It's despicable.  Yeah.  Well, do you know why now, I think?  Why do you think?  We would have never been able to invade Iraq then if we'd have caught him, would we?  That's...  Okay, like you said, you think...  No, if we'd have caught him, then there would have been no invasion of Iraq.  So maybe we chose not to catch him because we already had planned the invasion of Iraq.  Not at all bullshit.  They could have waterboarded him and said he confessed that Saddam Hussein helped him.  We would have had an easier time invading Iraq.  They would have waterboarded him. 
[03:00:00]  If you could get me to admit tonight, 11th, you could get Bin Laden to admit that fucking Saddam Hussein helped him.  Saddam Hussein would have been our ally against the Taliban.  Hey, look, I got no quarrel with Saddam Hussein.  I'm only talking about Afghanistan.  And the fact is, the Taliban would not have given him to us.  You don't know that.  You think that if he was read his Miranda rights, if we sent a fucking cop over there...  You know what I love about you guys?  You all talk a big thing, but when you only talk it, you don't walk it.  Pick up a gun and go fight with us.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm not talking about that. 
[03:00:30]  Bullshit.  You guys are all the same.  You know, you talk war, you send everybody off to war, but when it comes your time to go,  whoops, not me, I ain't going, let's send everybody else over there.  You stop it.  No, I'm not going to stop it.  It ain't nonsense.  It is nonsense.  I'm not saying go send the boys to war.  I don't want us to be the world's policemen.  I say pull them out of Germany, pull them out of fucking everywhere.  Pull them off the T.  We agree.  Completely.  We agree.  Pull them out of Korea.  Why are you yelling at me?  Because, Jesse, I don't care if the North Koreans...  You're agreeing with me, and you're yelling at me. 
[03:01:00]  Because I'm only saying we have a voluntary military, and in a time...  Which has to end.  In a time...  Bring back the draft.  Hold on.  I'll tell you why I'm yelling.  In a time when we were attacked by a nation that I feel was behind the attack, which is Afghanistan,  I am for the military doing what has to be done.  Now, let me ask you something.  I am not one of these guys that thinks the military should go and fight all over the world.  Where have we proven who attacked us on 9-11?  Where was that proven?  We were told that.  Where was it proven?  I believe bin Laden has said that he has agreed that he did it, and I believe that the hijackers said they were working for Al-Qaeda. 
[03:01:30]  It's pretty much known.  Really?  We interviewed the hijackers?  I thought they were all dead.  Well, that was a pretty good paper trail, though.  No, paper trail.  Come on.  Now, okay.  Surveillance that should have been used to stop them.  All right.  Let me ask you this one, then.  Yes, sir.  They said it was 19 of them.  How come five of them are still alive and they haven't been taken off the list of the 19?  Really?  Yeah.  Where are they?  They're over in Saudi Arabia.  They're alive.  Five of these guys that were...  Are they really alive?  Where's your proof of that?  You wanted Miranda Wright and proof that bin Laden did something, and you're saying there's five guys alive. 
[03:02:00]  Yes.  Three of them are pilots in the Saudi...  They're not pilots.  Jimmy, waterboard them and make them say no.  But there's not five of those hijackers alive.  Yes, they are.  They're not.  He's hosting a talk show.  No, he's not.  They're all dead?  You're sure of that?  Yes.  Were the bodies identified?  No, but that's...  Ah.  Ah.  Well, we'll just fly with that.  What the hell?  Well, my government told me that, so you know why I don't believe my government?  Well, you believe Saudi Arabia's government and they're over there flying planes around 
[03:02:30]  commercial airliners?  No, I don't.  But here's why I don't believe my government.  My government has lied to me so many times in my life.  Okay, fair enough.  They lied to me about the Gulf of Tonkin incident.  Isn't that pretty important?  The incident that got us into Vietnam?  Well, you didn't want to go back that far.  You don't want to go back that far with the Kennedy.  We can't go back that far in Vietnam.  You said to me that we're one of those guys that said...  No, because this happened in 2004, pal.  So we're not going back that far.  You said we send our guys off to war without giving a shit, and I'm telling you that's  not true.  Yes, it is.  I agree with you.  When did you go to war?  I've never been in the military. 
[03:03:00]  There you go, so you don't know.  But I say pull them out of every...  Because I've never been in the military, when we are attacked by, I feel, a nation, we should  not...  It should be proven first.  I feel we proved it.  You feel we didn't.  You also feel that fucking Bush was behind 9-11.  So we're always going to disagree.  Hey, don't put fucking words in my mouth.  You feel that the U.S. government was behind it, and Bush is ahead of the U.S. government.  I didn't say that.  Who do you think is behind it?  I just said...  Our government's covering it up.  We have not been told the truth.  So you feel that Bush...  Well, okay, wait a minute.  All right?  If you'll calm down a moment. 
[03:03:30]  You're yelling.  You said the F word.  You're the governor.  This is serious.  And I'm only talking your language, so you'll understand.  No, you shouldn't bring your dad down to my level.  Bring me up to yours.  You know?  I want to solve what you said about...  Answer this question.  No, I want to solve what you said about...  You know, if you're not going to let me talk, I'm out the door.  You've been talking the whole time.  All you do is yell over people, and you don't want to address point by point.  You act like we say, send our boys to war, fuck them.  We've never said that.  I agree with you, but I want to pull them out of Germany.  I want to pull them everywhere. 
[03:04:00]  The U.S. military should never be dying for other countries.  I don't care what happens.  Get them out.  Fuck them.  I don't care if Kim Jong-il takes this out.  That's not my business.  I just think that if we are attacked, we have the right to want our military to respond.  So that's not some warmonger saying, fuck the boys, send them over.  That's what I wanted to address.  Jesse just sits and looks at Jimmy.  Why?  Awkwardly.  That was a fair point I just made.  You were wrong when you said that.  I don't know.  I didn't listen. 
[03:04:30]  You never do.  You have X amount of points and you just talk over everybody.  Because you're a big guy and you talk loud.  I talked over you.  Yes.  You're just now yelling at me because I'm not talking.  I'm not yelling at you.  I'm just yelling about your point.  You accused us of something.  No, I didn't accuse us of nothing.  Sure you did.  You guys are just full of shit.  You're warmongers.  That's not the truth.  Yeah.  Yes.  I stand corrected.  Thank you.  You're a great American.  Well, I'm not saying I'm a great American, but I'm not a warmonger.  When your country calls, you're there. 
[03:05:00]  Hey, I've never been in the military, so you're brave.  I'm a coward.  I have no right.  We got it.  Stop.  Did I say that?  Yes, you did through implication.  We all speak this.  We have the commonality of language, so you can't say, did I say that when you say something.  I don't think you have to have been in the military to understand the power and the proper use of the military if you're an informed citizen of this country.  I think you can look and say, we shouldn't be the world police. 
[03:05:30]  And I think you can look and say, wow, this does threaten our national security directly, and the military should be used in those times.  He's nodding.  Good.  I just think it's a little, you know, obviously you've served.  You came from a family that served.  We didn't.  I think we were around during a weird time.  I missed the nom by, you know, four years.  What did you do in nom, Jesse?  No draft.  What did Jesse do in nom?  Nothing. 
[03:06:00]  He was a demolition guy.  No, I'm being serious.  I don't know.  I am too.  Nothing.  Demolition.  Are you being sarcastic?  Yes, he is.  No, I'm a Navy SEAL.  What do we do?  No.  I don't know.  Well, I'll put it to you this way.  We really don't know.  I just want to know a little bit about your military history.  The latest thing the Navy SEALs have done that was publicized, I put into poetry.  And that was on the night that Jesus Christ supposedly rose from the dead. 
[03:06:30]  The Navy SEALs shot three pirates straight through the head.  Cuckoo.  Wait a minute.  If you recall, remember the three pirates that took the ship?  Yes, exactly.  And that was on Easter night.  And the SEALs shot three straight through the head.  But what was your gig?  And I liked it.  Did you have a problem with that?  No.  You know I did the poem?  Why?  Because it shows, number one, that war doesn't take a holiday.  And it shows, number two, that we SEALs will kill you on Christmas if we feel like it. 
[03:07:00]  I think everybody was pretty goddamn impressed with that one.  I wasn't.  They didn't Mirandize those pirates.  They did not Mirandize those pirates.  Jimmy.  And it also wasn't in the U.S., was it?  But do you understand what I'm saying?  No, but do you understand what I'm saying?  It wasn't in the United States.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  Miranda is the law here.  It's not the law there.  All right.  So the technicality.  And the law of the seas are a lot different, too.  I know.  You know.  But trust me, you know, I can do you in and not think twice about it. 
[03:07:30]  It's a big deal.  It was my job.  I'm funnier than you.  You're tougher than me.  All right.  What do we get?  I'm better in a comedy club.  It's freaking debatable.  All right.  Well, then maybe you're not tougher than me.  All right.  What do you want me to tell you?  Sorry.  Let's step outside and find out.  Oh, stop it.  You're embarrassing yourself.  No.  I'll just bite your dick.  Stop it.  I don't care if you're tougher than me.  I don't give a shit.  You're also dumber, too.  You're a good one.  Oh, no.  You're the one that gets mad and pushes the microphone away.  And so I actually was agreeing with most of what you said, except when you got personal 
[03:08:00]  and implied that we're something that we're not.  I agreed with you about the overuse of the military completely.  Completely.  Go ahead.  My father was military.  Did you mention your father?  My father was military.  He happens to feel the same way I do.  So if you can mention your parents, I can mention my dad.  My mom, Kami Pinko.  She didn't believe in the war at all.  Why didn't you then follow in your father's footsteps?  Yeah.  I just didn't.  I followed in mine.  I drink.  Yes.  You followed in his crawl steps.  But Jesse didn't do anything in Vietnam?  No.  Oh.  Party? 
[03:08:30]  Nothing that...  He wouldn't talk about it.  Oh.  So you can't talk about it.  No, you can't.  You can't.  But I...  Well, I'll put it to you this way.  I wrote about one op that I did in my first autobiography book.  And the publisher refused to print it.  Really?  Yeah.  So why don't you make a blog?  Because it...  Well, because it's...  I was peeling potatoes.  No, it's because the operation that I talked about was so sensitive that it could have well  caused an international incident that they felt shouldn't be brought to light. 
[03:09:00]  So can't you put it on the internet somewhere?  I could put it anywhere.  But why should I talk about it?  It's no one's business.  Well, you wrote a book and you tried to put it in the book.  Well, I made a mistake.  I wrote about it in the book and then the publisher said, we can't print this because  he said it's too inflammatory.  Yeah, but you're the guy who knows, Jesse.  The fuck's the publisher?  He doesn't know.  He shouldn't dictate what you tell the public.  You know more than he does?  They publish it and they pay for it.  In a blog or something.  I don't do computers.  I'm computer illiterate happily.  Uh-huh.  So you're not smart than me.  I'm very good on computers. 
[03:09:30]  Well, good for you.  You're worse than me.  I also don't wear a watch.  I don't own a cell phone and will never.  Why?  Why?  Because to me, it's aggravating.  I mean...  I'll give you that.  Why would you have a beckoning call that people can ring you at any time and you walk  around with this thing where people can locate you?  Like my vehicles?  You know, they got that North Star stuff.  I disconnected immediately.  Really?  Absolutely.  I'd rather break the window if I lock my keys in than to have them know where I'm going 
[03:10:00]  and they can follow me every step of where I go.  Isn't that really a problem for you?  Yes.  They don't care.  Yes.  That means you're going to some interesting place.  No, but the point is the fact they can do it.  Where's Jesse?  With this satellite, if they want to, they can follow you and know right where you're  at.  Jesse, you're 6'8".  They can follow you anyway.  No, I'm not.  You're an easy guy.  They know where you're going.  No, they don't.  Jesse Ventura can't hide anywhere.  Yes, I can.  Mexico.  They know where you are.  You just told us where you go.  You can't find me.  Try finding me.  They can't find you. 
[03:10:30]  You're the giant American.  Let's play find Jesse Ventura.  And go.  You're not easy to blend in.  Where in the world is Jesse Ventura?  You know.  Jesus.  Well, like I said, I oppose that because these wars aren't going to be won and we're not even  paying for them.  You know, so we're going to send the kids to die and then we're also going to make them  pay for it when they come back because we're not paying for it.  Well, I agree with the fact that we shouldn't be world police.  We should pull them back.  Yep.  If you're in a situation that cannot be won, obviously, get the fuck out.  Get them out.  Yeah, but we have an ego in our country. 
[03:11:00]  After all, the Russians failed there.  So did the English.  But we're the Americans.  We won't.  Well, yeah.  And the reasoning, though, do you really think we went in there to, you know, colonize?  No, I think we went in there to protect the natural gas pipeline that we put in.  Really?  That's why I think we're there.  It's all about money.  The Russians went in to just annex the place.  The bottom line is always follow the money because they only do something if there's money  involved.  And in the case of Afghanistan, there's a huge natural gas pipeline there that's very 
[03:11:30]  important to our tribe.  How come between Iraq and Afghanistan and eight years gone by, we've still seen none of this  oil we're supposed to have?  We're supposed to have these giant...  Well, we're seeing it.  The oil companies are seeing it.  Are they?  Sure.  And you're paying for it every time you go to the gas station.  Well, I think I'm paying for 70-some-odd dollars a barrel from Saudi Arabia.  I don't think I'm paying for the covert oil that's coming in from Afghanistan.  Well, the Saudi oil's going bad.  That's why we had to go to Iraq. 
[03:12:00]  Because the Saudis are running out of oil.  Why don't we just go to Alaska?  I mean, instead of, like, this whole thing about Iraq, why don't we just go to Alaska or  figure out a way to get that?  Because heart is there!  But do you understand what I'm saying?  Like, there's a way to get all this crazy stuff done in Iraq.  Why not just legislate somehow and get it out of Alaska?  There's oil there.  I don't know.  Don't ask me.  But do you understand what I'm saying?  Like, that's such an easier solution than staging a war.  Yeah, but why use ours when we can use someone else's?  Because ours is easier.  It's less headaches.  There's less violence.  It's cheaper to bring from Alaska. 
[03:12:30]  If it's all about money, they're going to save money getting them from Alaska.  And not having to have security and all these people to protect.  It's cheaper, I imagine.  I might have an answer for you.  But do you believe we are very much a war-based economy?  A militaristic-based economy?  We're a very militaristic country.  That we need.  We're the most aggressive country in the world.  I mean, if I were a foreigner, I would fear the United States more than anyone.  Because we're the guys that will attack you.  You know, we'll line up our military and another sovereign nation will invade and we'll overthrow you. 
[03:13:00]  You know, that's what bothers me.  See, I never believed my country would do that.  But I saw the Nazis, or I heard of the Nazis doing it.  I know the communists did it.  And now we've done it.  So we're no better than them.  We'll line our military up and we'll invade and we'll occupy you.  You know, and to me, occupying another country is ridiculous.  And we're not just doing it in one.  We've got two now.  Iraq and Afghanistan.  You know, we're occupying.  And you think that these wars haven't had the direct effect on our economy? 
[03:13:30]  Oh, absolutely.  We're not paying for them.  And they're going to come.  The chickens will come home to roost at some point.  And ultimately, what will we have achieved?  I've yet to figure out what the end game is here.  And not only we're going to send these 30,000 troops in, right?  What is it that we declare victory to?  What is the flag that we're going to capture now where we can sit back and say, we won?  From what Obama said last night, the victory is that in 18 months, we take this corrupt, illegal government, 
[03:14:00]  turn them around, train their army and their police to fight the Taliban and al-Qaeda by themselves.  By themselves.  For us.  Yeah.  Why would they do that?  And then we leave.  What's their incentive to do that?  They're not going to.  But they're not going to.  We cannot in that short of time.  We've been in Iraq for how many years?  And we can't just leave now.  And we've done as much as we can to try to set up a government that can take care of itself. 
[03:14:30]  Well, you know what pleases my heart is that you look around now and you see all the poverty in our country.  And I feel so good that we're helping all these other countries so much more.  You know, when we've got problems of our own here that we seem to ignore.  You won't get an argument here.  We completely agree.  Well, there you go.  What's that about, Jesse?  I don't know.  I don't get it.  I mean, to me, don't you take care of your own backyard first before you worry about everybody else's? 
[03:15:00]  That's a little good cop, bad cop.  See, to me, it's got to be money.  Somebody's making huge amounts of money over there, like in Iraq.  Okay, Halliburton's profiting unbelievable.  Blackwater, the mercenaries, they're making a ton of money.  They were.  People are making money.  And that's why we're there.  That's the bottom line.  See, I wouldn't join the service today.  And I would encourage no one to.  You know why?  Our military is nothing more than the strong arm of our corporate.  When our corporate can't get the job done, that's when we send our military in to kick their ass and make them. 
[03:15:30]  And that's what we do.  Why is the dollar so shitty, then?  Why is the economy in the tank?  It's like, after all the stuff that's supposed to be great for us, the economy stinks and the dollar stinks.  Yeah, because the one thing you learn, or you try to learn, is that the worst thing a superpower can do is get involved in a war.  You notice China's not doing none of this.  China's doing their economy.  And that's why they're going to pass us so bad.  Because we're involved in these idiotic wars out there that drain your economy. 
[03:16:00]  They drain all your resources.  You accomplish virtually nothing.  When this is all said and done, I hope I'm alive 20 years from now.  Because I want to see the result.  I want to see what did we accomplish with these two wars that we went into.  Because I don't see the end picture.  I've got to comment on something you said that I think some people will find offensive.  That he's funnier than me?  Yes.  No, that you wouldn't join the military today.  Strong arm for corporate.  Corporate, yeah.  Now, you're talking to a lot of guys that are in the service. 
[03:16:30]  And that, to me, is demoralizing.  And coming from a guy that did come from Vietnam and went through a lot of the same public criticism by people,  don't you think that's bad for morale for people that are serving?  No, because we should take better care of our service people.  It's our job to only put them in the line of danger when we're threatened.  And we're not doing that.  We're using our military as an aggressive force out in the world. 
[03:17:00]  You know what's interesting?  When I lived deep down in Mexico, you know what the most popular T-shirt is down there amongst young people?  It shows a picture of George Bush.  And on the front, it says, Weapon of Mass Destruction.  They are a bunch of comedians down there.  Oh, they're funny.  But do you feel that we belong?  Yes, you're correct.  Do you think that Korea was justified?  Should we have been in Korea?  Which, what do you mean?  The Korean War?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't honestly answer. 
[03:17:30]  Is it justified?  Meaning, wasn't it just a kind of like, shouldn't we just allow them to do their own?  Yeah, yeah.  And Vietnam was the same way.  Do you agree, though, that sometimes you have to take things in the context of the time instead of, like, the past or what you think the future will be?  No, I believe you should learn from history and don't make the same mistake twice.  When you see it go bad once, why would you come back around and watch it again?  Well, maybe this time we'll get it right.  Okay, World War II, it ends. 
[03:18:00]  The Russians swoop in.  Now there's this battle over.  We also swoop in.  Of course we did.  But we did, of course.  Everyone wanted to chop up Europe, and we did.  We did.  You know what?  But that made Korea that much more important, because then we didn't want the communists taking over all the South East.  Yeah, right, right.  But it's the time.  But no.  No, no, no, I'm only laughing.  There's something I've got to tell you, and I'm waiting to finish.  Okay, okay.  I'm just saying, in the context of that time, it was a viable thing to do. 
[03:18:30]  I guess.  In hindsight, you might look back and go, why were we so paranoid?  But it was a very paranoid time.  Now, you can explain.  Okay, now, let me explain.  The last about four times I've gone to L.A., for some reason, I've had Russian car drivers, guys that lived in the Soviet, who now live here.  And they're all about my age.  And I get conversation with them.  And you know what I asked them?  I said, back in the Cold War, I said, what were they telling you in Russia?  And I said, well, they were telling us we had to stop the aggression of the American imperialists because they were going to take over the world. 
[03:19:00]  Now, and I tell them, well, we were told that you guys, the domino effect of communism, that you were going to take over the world.  Do you think the leaders got together and said, here's what we're going to sell to both of our peoples?  You scare the shit out of your people saying that the capitalist American imperialists are going to take over.  We'll tell our people that the domino effect of communism is going to take over.  So we get both sides to rise up.  That's a hell of an allegation. 
[03:19:30]  And both peoples are being told the same thing about each other.  And yet, later when we meet each other, we're all the same, aren't we?  Rocky Ford taught us that.  And the fact that those, I'm not even saying that it's wrong, but those four drivers from Russia, I mean, I don't know if I should question the entire Cold War because Ford just struggled like Soviets.  Well, they probably shouldn't, but they're real people.  And they really lived through it.  And they know what they were told.  And they know what they believed.  So why wouldn't you accept a regular person?  What, have they got to be a diplomat or a foreign leader elected before you'll believe them? 
[03:20:00]  Don't forget, was Hitler ever charged?  Was Hitler ever charged?  Like, when you think about, when you talk about bin Laden were charged, we just knew Hitler was the guy.  Everyone knows bin Laden was the head of al-Qaeda.  People knew al-Qaeda did this.  They did their own investigation.  Yeah, they know it.  We've proved it unbelievably beyond any reasonable knowledge.  I believe so.  Hey, look, you're comfortable making allegations about 9-11 with absolutely what I feel is not proof.  I'm comfortable making these allegations with what you feel is not proof.  Yep.  In Afghanistan, I really feel that that country was protecting bin Laden, who attacked us, and they were fostering and nurturing al-Qaeda. 
[03:20:30]  Iraq's totally different.  Every other country's different.  But what should we have done with Afghanistan as a country who I feel was aggressive and responsible for harboring bin Laden when he attacked the country?  I don't know.  And a training camp.  Invade them and occupy them?  But, I mean, it's not about occupying.  I guess that's what we do.  We invade and occupy them.  Let's say there was no Iraq.  Teach them the right way to live.  We had got, but that's...  Even though for thousands of years they've been fighting over there, but we're the United States. 
[03:21:00]  Again, without sarcasm, I'm asking you for real.  I'm not saying sarcasm.  I'm telling you exactly why I feel that so invading the country and occupying them with our military is the thing to do.  What should we have done?  You're saying you don't know.  You're giving a sarcastic answer to what we did do.  I'm saying what should we have done?  What's the answer there?  Forget Iraq.  I'm not going to argue with you about Iraq.  I was for it in the beginning.  I was wrong.  I'm against it.  We should not be there.  But what's the right thing in Afghanistan?  How would you handle that?  I don't know.  That's the difficult...  That's the 800-pound gorilla, really, when you look at it. 
[03:21:30]  Is invading a country and occupying it the answer?  I tend to think no.  It doesn't seem to work.  We tried it in Vietnam.  It failed miserably there.  But Vietnam, I think we had no business being with.  That was not our fight.  But we also propped up a phony government, just like we're doing here.  So they do have a great parallel to them.  Do we have no right to go after the Taliban as a government?  If the government was harboring this guy and this organization, which, look, the way  war is now, it's different.  They've killed 3,000 people.  Okay.  If you look at it that way, shouldn't we have attacked Saudi Arabia then? 
[03:22:00]  Because they were the people that were in the planes, supposedly.  Yeah, but they were just citizens as opposed to the government sanctions thing.  I hate Saudi Arabia.  We should have invaded Saudi Arabia.  I'll go with you there.  Not only that, then we could take all what they got of their oil.  No, we should just let them be overthrown.  We should just stop dealing with them.  And allow the fucking locals to have them and fuck the house of Saudi.  Yeah, but if we do that, they might not be good for our interests.  As for the oil.  So we go to Alaska.  That was my question.  Oh, okay.  Isn't Alaska...  Listen, Jesse's running out of time, and I wanted to know... 
[03:22:30]  Not really, because I got canceled, because Geraldo's not in town today, and I'm supposed  to do him next.  So I don't know what my schedule...  I got a couple...  I think I got an hour, if I'm wrong, of dead time yet.  But is it being...  Like, if we say...  I don't have the answers to everything, and I don't claim to have them all.  But I just do know that I feel strongly that we shouldn't be invading countries.  We shouldn't be occupying countries.  And it's going to be bad for our economy, and ultimately, I think it's going to be a 
[03:23:00]  disaster.  But did we invade Japan, though, or did we invade...  Like, when we feel that that country was the aggressor, is it invasion if you're responding  to the country attacking you?  No country attacked us.  But again, I'm saying, in the context of them protecting bin Laden and al-Qaeda, I feel  that Afghanistan, as a government, did.  Well, you feel that they did, but did they?  Well, the U.S. felt they did, too.  Well, we'll go there whether we did or didn't.  But you know what I'm saying?  You could make the point that the government was helping bin Laden and behind bin Laden. 
[03:23:30]  You don't know that.  Well, I feel that they probably...  Because, you see, the reason I'm such a cynic, I don't believe what my government tells me  today.  So many of the facts that my government comes out with, I tend to feel, well, wait a minute.  They've lied to me so many times.  Could they be lying and turning this into a political football, too, to give me belief?  Yes.  And you know what the most disgusting one we've done lately?  The one to Pat Tillman.  When our country lied and used it politically and tried to create something that didn't 
[03:24:00]  happen, they even lied to his family, this hero, this guy that quit the NFL and his multi-million  dollar contract to become an army ranger.  He was unfortunately killed by friendly fire, which any of us in the special forces knows  that's always a risk.  It happens.  It's bad, but it happens.  But what did our government then do?  For political advantage, they tried to create a whole different scenario.  They tried to say Al-Qaeda and all them killed him so that, what, we'd get even more angry. 
[03:24:30]  Now Al-Qaeda's even killed our hero, Pat Tillman.  And they lied to his family.  They lied to everybody.  So when my country tells me these things, like they're harboring Bin Laden and they're doing  all this stuff, I take it with that grain of salt.  I'm a skeptic.  I go, am I being lied to again by my own government to manipulate my thinking so that I will follow  and go along to get along?  Always remember, too, Thomas Jefferson's famous quote.  Get that bitch in here. 
[03:25:00]  I have a heart on.  No, dissension is the greatest form of patriotism.  And I'm a dissender.  I believe in dissension.  I believe that if you don't hold your elected people's feet to the fire, if you don't question  everything they do, you will get bad government.  And we got proof of that.  Is that why you didn't run for Senator?  Is that why you...  I didn't run.  I flipped a coin.  Really?  Yep.  True story.  I was split.  I didn't know what to do.  I was torn both ways and it was filing was going to end in an hour and it's a half hour 
[03:25:30]  drive and it got down...  Was it a peso?  No.  And I said, I turned to my wife and I said, I don't know what to do here.  And my wife looked at me and she said, well, you've always believed in fate and destiny,  haven't you?  And I said, pretty much.  She said, why don't you flip a coin?  And I sat back a minute and I went, you're right.  So I walked in the center of my floor.  I took a quarter and I looked at her, I said, heads I run, tails I don't. 
[03:26:00]  I flipped it in the air, I let it land, it came up tails.  I looked at her and I said, I'm not running, let's move on.  Were you a little relieved?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I left it to fate.  Now, if it would have came up heads, I'd be a U.S. senator right now and I'd be very powerful  because I'd be the 60th senator.  The one they would need to have to avoid a filibuster.  Can you imagine the power I'd have as an independent?  They'd have loved that one.  I'd have both of these sides giving me everything I wanted to try to buy my vote.  Because that's how they do there.  I don't think the Republicans would think they're going to get your vote. 
[03:26:30]  I think the Republicans would consider you a lost cost.  Yeah, they would give up on that.  No, that is not true.  I very much stand with Republicans on real fiscal issues.  You know, we're going to lose...  I'm fiscally conservative.  We're going to lose Jesse soon and I want to know about secret societies and everything  else that this show is about.  The show, all right.  Conspiracy, premieres tonight at 10 on True TV.  Yeah, secret societies deal with like the Bilderbergs, you know, that meeting that happens  every year.  Yeah, now what the hell is that about?  That's the power brokers of the world all meet. 
[03:27:00]  You know what's interesting about it?  They have such power.  Our president goes to it and our president has to sign a no-talk thing.  Really?  Yeah, they have the power to tell our president, you have to sign a thing saying you won't talk  about what went on here.  Isn't Rumsfeld a member of that?  I've heard of that.  There's a bunch of...  I felt a little offended.  I won governor and never got invited.  How come I didn't get to go there and sit in on this shit?  Because they know you don't open your yap about everything you saw.  Probably.  You can't keep your mouth shut.  I wouldn't have signed the no-talk thing, you know. 
[03:27:30]  Has anybody ever taped it?  Has anybody ever taped it or talked about it?  Oh, no.  There's more security there than you'll ever see at the Super Bowl or that you'll ever see  anywhere.  Obviously more than the White House.  Yeah, obviously more than the White House.  Are you scared by this secret society?  Uh, it's eye-opening.  I will tell you this.  Well, what do you know about it?  Did you explore this?  Watch the show.  Okay.  You know, I don't want to give everything away.  Well, that's a good point.  I haven't been able to watch the show.  But I will tell you this.  Because in doing these seven episodes on conspiracies, you can choose whether you can say they're 
[03:28:00]  all bunk.  Because in the end, we cover the conspiracy and we leave it up to you.  Did we provide enough evidence to where you can look at this and say, you know, there's  a little bit of merit here.  You know, there's something beyond what we've been told.  So, but I will tell you this.  In doing these seven conspiracies, and I say this very seriously, I got scared doing them.  And I don't scare easy.  But these things, doing this show frightened me.  Which one scared you the most? 
[03:28:30]  Uh, 2012.  Ah, come on.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We had Dr. Michiukaku say it's all bullshit.  Well, it might all be, but I've...  What scared you about the 2012 thing?  Well, because there's certain things that NASA backs up that's going to happen, and here's  what scares me, is the fact that every 160 years or so, the sun kind of goes crazy up  there, and it's due to happen.  And, well, here's the...  Back up again.  The Mayan calendar.  What it said was simply this.  December 21st of 2012, the world as we know it will end, and a new world will begin. 
[03:29:00]  That's the actual, what the Mayans said.  Now, you can throw that out saying, oh, they're just a bunch of old Mayans, what do they know?  They have no shoes.  But these people, believe it or not, when it came to the atmosphere and that, even with  all our technology today, we can't disprove the things that they learned back then.  They were very bright when it came up there.  Now, here's the story on 2012, and you can go to NASA, and they'll back this up. 
[03:29:30]  Our planet is protected by a magnetic force field.  Well, apparently, there's a large hole in it, and NASA will back you up because the  Voyager and all that they've proven.  There's a big hole in our magnetic force field.  Well, every 160 years or so, and this is also documented, the sun kind of goes crazy, and  it shoots off these solar flares that they call it, right?  Well, because of the hole in our force field, it happened 160 years ago, and it didn't really 
[03:30:00]  have a major effect because we weren't dependent upon electricity like we are today.  Back then, it might have just knocked out a couple of telegraph offices, and that would  have been the extent of it because 160 years ago, we didn't have the massive grid system.  We weren't as dependent upon electricity.  The guys I've talked to said, here's the good part, we can prevent it, but no one's  paying attention right now.  It'll cost about 200 to 400 million to put these resistors in our entire grid system, 
[03:30:30]  but what this guy told me is that when this happens, and he won't say it's December 21st,  2012, he says, or thereabouts.  When this happens from the sun, it could very well knock out the entire grid system of North  America to where we could be without electricity for up to two to four years.  It sounds like Y2K.  Now, Y2K was created by us.  This has nothing to do with us.  This is up there, and it's documented.  This is out of our control.  I said that, too.  I said it, but I even bring it up. 
[03:31:00]  I said, well, wait a minute.  We had Y2K.  I had to sit in the thing all night long thinking that, you know, the world was going  to go down, blah, blah, blah, and nothing happened.  But like he said, yeah, but that was us.  That was just us and our computers.  He said, this comes from the sun, and it's documented.  You can go to NASA.  They will verify it and all this.  And if that indeed happens, like I said to him, I said, well, I live in Mexico half the  year, and I live off the grid, and I have solar power.  What will happen to me?  And the guy said, well, you'll probably have about 100,000 people wanting to live with 
[03:31:30]  you.  Now, imagine you're all New Yorkers out here, right?  Look what happened when they lost power here for a mere 24 hours.  What would happen if the whole North American grid system blew out, and it took us two years  to get it up and running again?  Oh, well.  Wow.  I mean, you'd have chaos.  Call the herd.  Call the herd.  Well, you'd have chaos.  And, you know, so that one scared me the most.  How would we see our movies?  Right.  But that one got to me the most, the fact that that's really out of our control. 
[03:32:00]  Yeah.  You know, if this happens, and we're not preparing for it in some manner.  But this guy says that it'll cost between $200 million to $400 million to put these resistors  into the grid system.  That's not a lot of money.  Right.  But he said the problem is nobody's paying attention to it.  Because it's bullshit.  Because it's bullshit?  Well, it's not, because it's all documented.  There was the big one 160 years ago, and then in 1921, apparently, there was a milder  one that knocked out the grid of a couple cities. 
[03:32:30]  I hope so.  I'm waiting for anarchy to tell you the truth.  It's got his guns.  He's ready.  I want things mixed up.  I want to mix things up a little bit.  You know, so the show, we cover that.  You guys cover UFOs at all?  The what?  UFOs.  Do you guys go into that at all?  The which?  UFOs.  No, no, no, no.  Nothing with that.  Because there's no, what am I going to add to Area 51?  There's nothing new.  We kept it within the decade.  Area 51's way back in the 40s, you know, or whatever it happened.  How about a Bigfoot update?  No, here's what we, no, here's what we, here's the eeriest one I did, Manchurian Candidates. 
[03:33:00]  What's that about?  You know, whether the government can create an assassin under hypnosis and all this?  Woo-hoo.  Wait till you watch this show.  Yeah, you think, uh...  No, I talked to a guy who claims to be one.  Oh, I thought you killed somebody.  Yeah.  And he's got, like, uh, maybe a code word or something happens and then they just...  Well, he doesn't really know, and he always...  When I got done interviewing him, it was interesting, after he left...  Pick your words wisely when you talk to him.  He said that, uh, the only reason he talked was because it was me. 
[03:33:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Big fan.  He told me that.  Was he on camera?  Well, no, he trusted me.  He trusted me.  He said, you know, but...  I thought maybe he was a fan of the square circle.  When he left...  You can't be trusted, though.  You talk too much.  Yeah, when he left...  Who's trusting you with any info?  Uh, I turned to my crew and I said, boy, I'll tell you something.  You can choose not to believe this guy, but he believes it.  Did you film his face?  Did he let you film his face?  Sure.  So...  Absolutely.  But here's the deal.  I'll give you a little scenario on how...  Okay.  When a person apparently is put under heavy hypnosis or that type of thing, if they have 
[03:34:00]  a traumatic accident or something, it can jar their old memory back somewhat.  That's what happened to him.  He was involved in a bad car accident, right?  So he started getting his memory back on other stuff.  Well, will you hear this?  As part of his rehabilitation after the car wreck, he had to get an MRI.  They put him in the MRI and the machine went ballistic.  You know why?  Chip in his head.  Five of them. 
[03:34:30]  Five chips in his head?  Five chips in his body were discovered.  So...  Now, isn't that pretty...  Did someone just snatch him up or was he part of a...  He claims he was taken at age six and that his father used to head the CIA down in St.  Martin and all that.  And so he was...  And plus, it's his background.  He's part Native American.  And apparently, there's something that they study about who's more susceptible and who's  not.  You know, like in a Manchurian candidate, your best bet would be to get an ex-military guy. 
[03:35:00]  And the reason being is that a military guy has always already gotten to the point where  he can say murder's okay.  I can kill someone because you have to make that logical decision.  When you join the military, you realize that there may be a time you might have to kill  somebody.  So you're not comfortable with it, but you accept it.  That's what...  See, under hypnosis, they can't force you, like put you under hypnosis, say, go jump off 
[03:35:30]  the roof.  Well, you'll come out of it before you'll do that.  But if they did it to you for over a year, then it's a possibility that you would do something.  Did you backtrace his military history or his father?  Did you guys investigate that?  Oh, yeah.  So he's legit?  Oh, yeah.  I want to see that one, man.  Oh, yeah.  No, it's good stuff.  I'll tell you what.  Like I said, you can choose to not believe any of these, but I guarantee you, you're going  to find this show because there's the frightening part thing.  What if it is?  Yeah, we're all watching. 
[03:36:00]  That's the big point.  What if it is?  All right.  Quickly, I see one of the episodes here, global warming.  Now, this has been a big, big subject of late, especially because of these emails that came  out and are kind of debunking some of that.  I believed it, but I'm not so sure now.  Now you're not so sure?  Yeah.  Well, and here's why.  Cap and trade.  The solution they have for global warming doesn't solve it.  It simply makes money.  It makes a lot of money.  A lot of money.  And it doesn't solve the pollution because you can buy your way out of polluting. 
[03:36:30]  You can pollute the same as you always do.  You can simply pay it off.  Well, how does that solve global warming?  And that's what caused my red flag to go up.  Wait a minute.  They're going to pass this legislation that really does nothing to solve the problem.  All it does is collect money.  Do you see Al Gore as being a big believer in it or a businessman that saw an opportunity?  Both.  Really?  Both.  Yep.  And the real guy is this character will reveal to you, a guy called Maurice Strong.  He's the guy behind all of it. 
[03:37:00]  He's a big guy at the UN.  And they're also using global warming to help promote one world government.  Because this will be the first tax that will be a tax of the world.  A world tax.  Not a tax from a nation.  And that causes me great despair.  Although I will say this.  Maybe it's evolution.  Maybe a one world government.  Maybe we can't do nothing about it.  Maybe it's...  Because I believe in evolution.  Dr. Kaka...  Miju Kaka always talks about like a planetary government.  Not being some controlling force.  But instead of working against each other, eventually we just work as a planet. 
[03:37:30]  And then we harness the weather.  And then we harness energy around us.  But of course you run the fear, okay, who would abuse this?  Oh, yeah.  You know, you always run the fear.  In a perfect world, it might be great.  Because I've told people, the best government, you know what the actual best government is?  Benevolent dictator.  But your key is you've got to be benevolent.  You know, because then you can get things done.  If you're the dictator, hey, we need a bridge here.  Build the bridge.  Da-da-da.  But, again, it would be abused. 
[03:38:00]  Like all dictators, power corrupts.  Wouldn't aggression, though, like as we evolve, doesn't aggression become less and less and less?  Like, say, a thousand years from now.  I don't think so.  I think aggression's becoming more and more today.  We seem to be more aggressive today than we've ever been.  I don't think as a species we are.  Maybe you're looking at the military action in the U.S.  But look, as a species, I think we're a lot different than we were at 5,000 years ago.  Well, no, I don't agree.  I disagree.  You know why?  We've got protests out there going on whether people can go to the doctor.  We've got people protesting.  Should you be able to go to the doctor or not? 
[03:38:30]  Right, but they're not just burning places down.  But we're not protesting war, are we?  We're protesting whether you can go to the doctor or not.  Well, it's all immediate self-interest.  We see the effect of not going to the doctor as being an immediate effect.  We don't see the maybe over...  Well, to me, we should be protesting these wars, not protesting whether someone can go to the doctor.  Are you saying that we haven't evolved like that because you threatened to beat me up and you feel guilty?  I have never threatened to beat you.  You didn't threaten me, but you kind of did.  You kind of did.  Step outside.  I was having fun and doing humor.  He just said step outside. 
[03:39:00]  That's right.  How the hell do we know when you're having...  Have a heater.  I'm not mad.  Yeah, I know.  You have a heater.  You can't have a heater inside.  You've got to have them outside.  Be more funny.  I've got to tell you something, though.  I used to, because of freedom, I used to really oppose the smoking in the bar thing because I thought,  shouldn't that be left up to the bar?  You know, because it's an act of freedom.  I completely still agree with that, and I'm not a smoker.  Leave it to the fucking bar.  I don't now, and I'll tell you, because this summer, for some reason, I had to do three 
[03:39:30]  things at the bar.  God, was it nice.  I didn't have to come home...  Oh, we admit that it's nice.  We admit that it's nice.  Trust me.  Wait.  I didn't have to come home and immediately throw my clothes into the hamper because they  stink.  I didn't have to run in and take a shower because my hair smelled and my body smelled.  We're with you.  And it was actually very enjoyable.  You just explained something.  And I just sat and thought, Cal, you know, they really shouldn't be able to do it, but  it sure is nice that they have.  You just explained why people aren't protesting the war, but they are protesting the doctor. 
[03:40:00]  It's not about not caring.  It's about immediate self-interest.  It's like the doctor we see affecting us immediately, whereas the war is like, eh, it's easier to not  feel like you're being affected by that.  But I've got to admit, going to the bar without the smoke, God, was it nice.  That's a good point.  You know, your eyes didn't burn all night.  You didn't come out coughing.  And like I said, you didn't stink, you know.  As governor, where did you stand as far as the Second Amendment goes?  Well, I'll give it to you.  My definition of gun control is being standing at 25 meters and putting two rounds in the 
[03:40:30]  same hole.  That's gun control.  Very good.  I like that.  Is that a good answer?  Absolutely.  That's called gun control.  Yes.  Stand back 25 meters, put two rounds in the same hole.  You got great control of that gun.  I don't like some of the people that are saying that you've got to have more laws against  law-abiding citizens.  Meanwhile, again, the bad guys can pick up whatever they want.  Well, that's an attempt to disarm us and take control of us. 
[03:41:00]  I will not disagree with that.  Which goes on.  It's the same as these other things where they're taking our freedoms.  They've suspended habeas corpus.  I wish you were that passionate about that.  The fact that they can now arrest you and simply say, you did a terrorist thing and you  can't have a lawyer.  They can hold you indefinitely.  Are there examples of them doing that to citizens who aren't involved in terrorism at  all?  I don't know.  How would we know?  Well, they have families.  If we're holding someone without charging them, how would we know? 
[03:41:30]  Well, they have families.  Don't they have to charge you first so you know what you got charged for?  They have jobs and people they know who would go, hey, Fred hasn't showed up for work  in three weeks.  Oh, yeah.  Cops grabbed him.  He's in prison for being in town.  I don't know.  I don't know.  It's hard.  They couldn't even hide Abu Ghraib.  It's very hard to hide information these days with cell phones and technology.  It's harder to hide shit because the immediacy of information is available.  I just wish I'd like to waterboard Dick Cheney.  Oh, my goodness.  He wouldn't last very long.  I know, but I think he needs to have it done to himself so that he'll clearly understand 
[03:42:00]  with his five deferments from Vietnam, he'll then understand what's torture and what's  not.  You know, because Dick Dick seems to call it enhanced interrogation.  I call him Cheney the coward.  Now, what about interrogations in Vietnam?  Now, there was there was intense interrogation that went on there that supposedly led to maybe  people knowing where enemy.  No, because no, no, no.  Let me let me explain why torture doesn't work, because if you're being tortured, you're 
[03:42:30]  going to say whatever needs to be said to stop.  Let me let me check with the listeners.  You can.  Yes, they are.  They're saying everything.  No, seriously.  If you're being tortured, you will say whatever it's required to say to stop the torture.  That's why it's not allowed in court.  If you torture someone, the confession is not allowed in court because it was under torture.  What if it's for information or say it like it's for a name?  How is the information?  How can you deem it good? 
[03:43:00]  He's going to say what you want to hear.  No, no, no.  Let's just say like you got a guy like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  And I'm talking about people who we believe to be very high ranking members.  I'm not talking about average foot soldiers or regular guys.  Because a guy on that level who has, let's say, knowledge and who has said that he was  Mastermind at 9-11.  Let's say you say, where are the cells?  After being waterboarded, you said he did it.  Let's say, let's say, you would have too.  You say, I'm sure I would have.  Let's say you say to that person, name three other people who were involved, where are they?  And then he gives you names that you didn't have. 
[03:43:30]  And then you go and you find out those people have bomb making equipment.  And they are actually what he said.  Now, you've tortured the information out of him.  Can you name me an example of that?  I don't know.  Where it worked?  Well, again, I don't know.  See, again, I would like to see an example of it to where it worked.  All of the things that they've stopped.  I don't know how many of them came from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.  Most of them they've gotten from not torture.  They've gotten from being nice and crushing people.  And bounties work and Viagra work, too, in Afghanistan.  They give Viagra to a lot of guys.  They got information, believe it or not.  Viagra actually worked a lot because these are older guys. 
[03:44:00]  And these warlords, they can't fuck anymore.  And they give them Viagra and they're fucking their wives.  I've never heard about that.  Yeah, the military is not stupid.  But I think, I'm saying in an example like that, if it does work like that.  No, because the rule of law of our country says we don't torture.  And again, if you're going to have the rule of law and live by it, you have to live by it when it's inconvenient.  Well, is it even if the game is in a very gray area as far as what it means?  Well, the game has changed a little bit in that it's citizens attacking citizens. 
[03:44:30]  We've never faced that before.  Well, then why didn't we waterboard?  Okay, I'll give you a great example.  Oklahoma City bombing.  Why didn't we waterboard McVeigh?  There's a lot of people think more were involved than them, too.  Why didn't we give McVeigh a good waterboarding to get information from him?  Well, they did execute him.  So I think that's, you know, but to gain information, execution won't get you information.  Maybe they felt that there was nothing else to get from him and they got what they needed.  But why wouldn't they just to make, there's plenty of people think more were involved than just those two guys. 
[03:45:00]  There's a difference between how we handle enemy combatants and how we handle our own citizens.  It doesn't matter a citizen.  No, no, I mean how we, but how we handle, how we handle American citizens.  No, but so it's okay to waterboard European citizens.  No, no.  I'm all for that.  If they're, if they're enemy combatants, as they were calling them, enemy combatants, whatever you want to call them.  I'll put it to you this way.  They then are not due, the due process that we are here. 
[03:45:30]  So shouldn't we be above our enemy?  Um, shouldn't we be, shouldn't we stand for something?  Not all the time.  Really?  Yes, because.  Okay, so we, so we should get down in the mud and the pigs will love it.  Uh, you know what?  If we understand where we're going, that we are going in the mud, and sometimes you have to fight.  So two wrongs do make a right.  No, no, but that's not true.  You know, I'm not talking about us going in and beheading people and stuff,  but, but treating these, uh, vicious people with compassion. 
[03:46:00]  Well, why don't we treat, well, Charles Manson got Miranda.  Charles Manson had his day in court.  Who's worse than him?  Again.  Charles Manson was not a citizen who was, uh, targeting other citizens, like, under the guise of,  look, we had him.  We had the guy.  Nothing else was happening.  It wasn't like Manson was the head of a network.  Yes, he was.  He was the head of his family, and they were out butchering people in California.  But they were all with him, I'm saying.  They were all with him.  They didn't go out and do other butchering when he wasn't, uh, when he got locked up. 
[03:46:30]  It was done.  They had the guy, and they got Squeaky Fromm, and they got fucking Tex Watson, and they got  all of them.  They, they cleaned house with Manson.  They knew who did it.  No, they didn't.  They got them.  No, they didn't.  Who did, who did go to jail?  There's a bunch of Manson family people that never went to jail.  Read Vince's book, Helter Skelter.  People that were involved with the murders?  Well, people that they couldn't, didn't have enough evidence to involve them.  They didn't have enough evidence.  But the point is, he still had rights in this country.  As, as awful as he was, he still had rights. 
[03:47:00]  And when we get to the slippery slope, who decides?  He wasn't an enemy of, of this, the state.  He wasn't an enemy of the country.  He wasn't an enemy combatant that was looking to.  How is that any different?  It's different.  It's called killing people.  There's a difference between war.  You're not, you're not going to convict a soldier.  They're not soldiers.  I'm saying, I'm saying, you're not going to convict a soldier, a United States soldier,  for going into war and under the rules of combat, killing another human being. 
[03:47:30]  You're not going to take him and go, well, you're, you're, I'm going to convict you or  try you for murder.  It's the same thing.  They are afforded certain, you know, liberties.  Well, okay, Lieutenant Calley was convicted because he killed a bunch of civilians.  Well, he went a little fucking ready.  Well, wait, wait.  Now, weren't these civilians killed in the towers?  Yes.  Okay, so you still had to try him in court.  He committed a crime.  He was read his rights, and he was tried in court. 
[03:48:00]  The difference is he didn't, he had worked for two years to create a network to make that  happen.  I'm not saying it's right.  How is that any different?  I'll tell you how.  Because it's a military operation.  They're not a military.  But they're operating as a military operation on U.S. soil, and they hijack commercial  airliners.  So do the Hells Angels.  Do you not see the difference between the Hells Angels and somebody hijacking a commercial  airliner and flying it into a building?  No, but they're an organization that's involved in bad activities, and they kill people. 
[03:48:30]  When have they done anything that has killed 3,000 people, or 2,800, whatever it was?  When have they ever done anything that was as much a threat to the national security as that  was?  Well, our bottom line, we get back to it again.  Nothing's been proven.  But what?  Okay.  But let's just...  You know, and you and I will...  What have you proven about the Hells Angels?  I mean, come on.  You're right.  The Hells Angels.  They're a motorcycle gang.  They've done some bad stuff.  But to actually mention them in a discussion about what they're trying to do...  Well, what I'm saying to you, I'm making the comparison. 
[03:49:00]  Listen, here you have an organization that's involved in crime.  Yes, mafia, Irish...  All of them.  Sure, absolutely.  And so, should we treat them the same way?  Because certain...  Sometimes people die around them for no reason.  They kill people.  You're going to tell me that they've never killed anybody?  But they're not hijacking commercial airliners and flying them into buildings because...  But they might if it served their purpose, wouldn't they?  I don't know.  They might do it then.  I don't know.  Maybe they would.  Maybe they would.  You know? 
[03:49:30]  What does that prove?  And if they did...  Well, what it proves is you have to treat everyone the same under the law.  You can't simply say, okay, the law applies to you, but it doesn't apply to you.  Because who plays that God figure that makes that decision?  Who do you allow to be able to make that decision?  You're not wrong, but the decision of...  The way the legal system is, you know how it is.  The way the legal...  So you think that we should just allow these guys...  Look, we saw what happened with the Zacharias Moussaoui trial.  It's a fucking circus.  And so we're going to allow these guys just to... 
[03:50:00]  So you're saying that they don't deserve a trial?  Not saying that.  No.  That our government just says you're guilty...  No.  And we're going to execute you or do what we do.  No, I'm not saying that.  You're putting words in my mouth.  I'm not saying that.  Well, I'm asking...  No, I'm not saying that.  Well, then when do you have a trial?  When do you allow our rules of law to...  Is it only for our citizens?  It's hard to...  Honestly, in this situation, I don't know because we've never faced this type of an enemy before.  Then why...  This country has never faced this before.  Why wouldn't you take POWs from any war we've ever been in and bring them over and try each and every one for murder of U.S. citizens? 
[03:50:30]  Because they represent a country.  All right.  We're in a different situation.  These people don't represent a country.  Thank you.  Bin Laden didn't even represent the Taliban.  But wait, we're back to the Hell's Angels.  They don't represent a country.  They're like a gang.  Yeah, they're a gang within the United States.  They're American citizens.  Well, what difference does that make?  The difference is...  Our laws apply.  You don't have to be a citizen to have our laws. 
[03:51:00]  I understand, but when we're...  Otherwise, what would we do to tourists?  When we're at war with somebody, the rules are treated...  Are different.  You know that.  The rules of engagement are different.  For military.  Yes, and...  You don't think Khalid Sheikh Mohammed should be held in a military rule?  Boy, that is quite the loophole, then, that people could not come over and invade our country.  He should be tried for murder, because he killed...  He's a civilian who killed civilians.  He should be tried the same way Manson was.  Al-Qaeda is operating as a military operator. 
[03:51:30]  It's a different enemy.  I mean, the U.S. has never seen an enemy that operated like this.  What a great loophole.  Let's get a bunch of people from Somalia or from Afghanistan, load up a ship, come over  to the U.S., not as an army, not as a representing a country...  Did that happen?  And just...  No, let me just put this as a hypothetical example.  Now, let him just sweep on in and try to take over the United States with a little army.  Yep.  And now, instead of treating them as military combatants, we have to try each and every one 
[03:52:00]  of them as a criminal with the same rules and regulations.  No, I would say you don't give them any rights.  You simply take them out back and execute them like the Wild West.  No, no, that's silly.  No, that's what you're telling me.  No, you're telling me there's now a loophole for invading our country.  No, he's not.  Who's invaded our country?  I'm saying there's a loophole now, the way you put it, if some entity wants to invade  the United States, they can now do it without the repercussions of not having due process. 
[03:52:30]  They will then have due process?  The same things that we're afforded?  No.  Yeah, not in our country.  Yeah, it's crazy.  Absolutely.  I agree with you.  You would allow...  My God, take them out back and hang them.  No, we should do it, because you know that you're not going to be a victim of terrorism,  so what we should do is just allow citizens to be slaughtered while we...  We're not allowing anything.  It's called great police work.  No, no, no.  Don't violate those civil liberties.  Do not violate civil liberties.  Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Do not profile. 
[03:53:00]  Do not investigate Muslims because they're Muslim, because that's a profiling, and everybody  on the left goes ballistic when you profile, because that's not a 40-citizens' due process.  You're profiling them.  You're judging them guilty before they were tried, so you can't do that.  Well, let's not leave it there, either.  We're also profiling the Mexicans.  We should...  We profile the Italians for the mafia.  You profile bikers for hells.  Yeah.  Profiling works to a certain degree, as long as citizens are afforded a certain amount  of respect.  And I like the fact that now we don't even do it at the borders.  Where are Mexicans being profiled? 
[03:53:30]  Well, I drive across every year, and now the last time I drove across the border, I showed  my passport at the border, and I was two hours into Arizona on the freeway, and I had  to do a two-hour stop there because the cars were backed up because there was an immigration  stop in the middle of Arizona, not at the border.  But that seems logical.  Really?  People got across.  Well, I mean, they do DWI checkpoints.  Gee, it only goes against our Constitution, but what the hell? 
[03:54:00]  DWI checkpoints do, too, technically.  No.  Our Constitution says you can travel freely inside the United States.  So DWI checkpoints also?  No, no, no, no.  Why?  Because that's driving a car and a license, and you're dealing with a cop.  Same thing here.  No, it isn't the same.  This is immigration.  So what?  You're checking to see if...  So what?  You're a citizen.  You're not being hassled if you're a citizen.  Yes, you are.  You're asked to produce.  Okay.  They already did it at the border.  Same as DWI checkpoints.  You're asked to prove your sobriety.  No, it's different.  It's not different.  Yes, it is.  It's different because it doesn't prove your point, but it's not different.  Because driving is a privilege. 
[03:54:30]  Yes, they weren't stopping citizens walking.  No, driving is a privilege.  I don't have a right to drive.  Right, exactly.  It's a privilege.  But you have a right to be a citizen.  It's your right not to be questioned inside the United States if you're a citizen.  So you think we should...  Don't the police have a right to ask you...  This isn't the police.  This isn't the police.  You're talking about the Border Patrol.  This is immigration.  Immigration.  Oh, okay.  So what right does immigration have to pull me over in the middle of Arizona and ask me 
[03:55:00]  to produce papers that I'm a citizen?  That seems a little shifting.  Yeah, but they were stopping people because they wanted to make sure that they weren't illegals.  They weren't looking for you.  So what if they ask you to produce?  And I mean that.  I refused.  Of course you did.  Because you're a recognizable guy.  Because I believe in the Constitution.  So do I.  But again, it's not a suicide.  No, you don't because you're saying that this is okay.  You're right.  I don't believe in the Constitution.  Stop it.  Stop it.  I don't believe in the Constitution.  You're violating it.  No, I'm not.  I'm exercising my free speech.  Boo-hoo.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:55:30]  And time.  Wow.  I love the Constitution.  It troubles me because we're out in the middle in the United States and you're asked to produce  your citizenship when you've already done it at the border.  And our country has never made us have to produce any type of thing like that just to  freely travel about the country.  Where are your papers?  Do you have to produce your...  Where are your papers?  Can you leave Minnesota into South Dakota?  And I foresee in the future they're going to have, right at the borders, state to state, 
[03:56:00]  where you're going to have to produce paperwork to go from one state to the next.  It's called EasyPass.  And that's called taking away your freedoms in light of keeping us safe.  Slippery.  That's what you'd say to the police doing our police work.  Let's keep us safe.  That's what you'd say about the police doing our police work.  Don't put word on it.  I said you would.  That ain't police work.  That's immigration.  But if it wasn't a cop, say the cop had done it.  No, no, no.  It ain't a cop.  You said it's all police work to stop terrorists.  A cop can pull you over.  So if they started questioning people in a mosque, you'd say, oh, that's racist. 
[03:56:30]  A cop can pull you over in demand.  Don't put words in my mouth, please.  I'm worried.  You've done it to me.  You did it to me.  You said I don't believe in the Constitution.  Bye, guys.  Bye, Jess.  Governor.  You always just sulk and walk away.  Why?  You put words in my mouth.  There's a fucking guy here telling me I got a schedule.  You're using dirty language, asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bye, tough guy.  Bye, tough guy.  And thanks for your service to our company.  You're welcome.  Thanks for touching me with your fucking stupid riffraff fucking Rocky Horror hairdo. 
[03:57:00]  You're bigger than me and stronger than me.  So what?  I don't give a shit.  You want to beat me up?  Go ahead.  I'm not going to fight a guy like you.  That means nothing to me.  I know.  I argued with you.  You put words in my mouth and you didn't like when I did it to you.  You put words in my mouth saying I didn't believe in the Constitution and that's bullshit.  It's not true.  I don't agree with abusing it.  Thank you for your service.  Oh, you're welcome.  You're a bigger patriot than me. 
[03:57:30]  Godspeed.  Fuck out of here.  Fuck out of here.  Wow.  Wow.  What happened?  He's a fucking baby.  What happened?  That ended on a fucking baby.  A nice note.  Who gives a shit?  A big fucking guy that doesn't like the little guy yelling.  You scared him, Jimmy.  No, here's what that is.  He wanted to knock my fucking block off, but he knows that he shouldn't or he can't because  of the law or all this stuff. 
[03:58:00]  Fuck you.  I don't care because I fucking hate that shit.  What happened, Sam?  I really do.  Don't fight.  I bow to you.  I would never.  So do I.  I would never try to challenge a guy like that physically and I don't posture that way.  He would murder me.  You're like fucking Spider.  You were just like Spider.  I would never talk tough guy talk.  I was arguing an ideological point.  I would never get in Jesse Ventura's face and think I'm going to outman him. 
[03:58:30]  That was not my point.  I've never done that.  Don't fucking tough guy me.  I hate that.  He was tough guy.  Fuck him.  I don't care how strong he is.  I hate that.  You are.  That drives me nuts, man.  That's my fucking pet peeve.  I hate it.  Suicide by wrestler was what he was trying.  Holy shit.  It's not a tough guy thing.  The guy would just.  It's not about that.  I'm not going to fight Jesse Ventura.  I just.  I can't be bullied.  It makes me fuck.  Fuck you.  I hate it.  How'd you feel when he tapped his shoulder? 
[03:59:00]  Annoyed.  Not intimidated.  Annoyed.  Annoyed.  Thank you for your service.  He didn't do it hard.  It wasn't a threatening.  Yeah.  But it was.  Don't try to alpha mail me, stupid.  Danny's just put up a picture of the Crypt Keeper.  Danny's real brave.  Jimmy's the only one that opened his mouth like a man.  I fucking.  Dude.  Like a man.  That drives me crazy.  That was a great ending.  That drives me nuts.  Wow.  What is he saying down the hall there?  Who cares?  Who cares?  I'm just curious.  I asked him if when his book comes out in April, he'd be happy to come back because 
[03:59:30]  despite the tumult, that really sounded well.  He goes, nope.  Not doing it.  Good.  Fuck you.  Bye.  Don't.  We're done with him?  Don't.  We've had intense discussions with the guy.  I walked with him into the elevator.  And he always comes back.  And I said, Governor, I know that your feelings may have gotten hurt and you don't like Jim.  Who cares?  I don't like him either.  He's a sulker.  I don't respect that little shit.  I don't respect him either.  I respect his military service, but I think he's a fucking, I don't respect him in a debate  because he's a baby who pushes his microphone. 
[04:00:00]  Aw.  What's the matter?  You're not used to being challenged by a small guy, you fucking big dumb wrestler?  I fucking hate that shit.  I mean.  By the way.  I never, it's not like I stood up and go, what?  I would never do that, dude.  People are saying best ending ever.  By the way, yes, we did get that on video.  And boy, will that video be on.  I don't give a shit if he comes back.  That's a big one.  I don't care.  That's a biggie right there.  That's a big one.  I don't, I swear to God, I don't care if he comes back.  Wait till you see Jesse's face on that video. 
[04:00:30]  He's, honest to God, he wanted to strangle you.  Too bad.  I know.  Then don't argue with me on the radio.  Just bully me in an alley like you probably would have if you weren't a dumb fucking wrestler.  I fucking hate big guys.  I'm afraid of Jimmy being more funny.  Dude, I really, I hate that shit.  I fucking hate that shit.  Bravo.  I hate it.  Honestly, there's nothing I can say, the listeners can say, Anthony can say.  It's a bravo all the way around.  So, trust me.  I would never have tried to speak that way. 
[04:01:00]  Me and I saw the look that Jesse gave you.  Bravo.  Wait till you see this fucking video.  Nose to nose and just, you did not back down an iota.  But stay, no, I won't back down.  I know.  But again, if it came down to a real fight, the acknowledgement is, the guy's going to murder me.  I don't know if I'm going to fight Jesse.  It's not about that.  It's an argument.  Even if it was a small guy or a woman I was arguing with, which is what I am to him.  It was that whole push the mic away.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, no.  Don't try to fucking alpha mail me in an argument.  That's what he was doing.  We had a really good discussion with the guy, too.  Why did it have to end there?  Because he's a guy like... 
[04:01:30]  You know what?  I, I, I, I...  I'll tell you what.  I know why.  He's fading out.  I'll be completely honest.  What got to him at the end there?  I didn't like when he goes, well, you don't like the Constitution.  He doesn't like me because I don't agree with him.  And I'm fucking...  Don't put fucking words in my mouth.  He put fucking words in my mouth.  And then he called me an asshole and I called him an asshole.  And when Jimmy called him out on putting words in his mouth, he had no defense for it.  Because that's what he is.  He's one of those big bully motherfuckers who likes to use his size and his weight.  And he talks over everybody.  And he's not a dumb guy.  I'm not going to say...  So what?  Fuck him. 
[04:02:00]  He's not a dumb guy.  He's not a dumb guy.  I just want to see Jimmy look.  I just disagree with him.  Don't turn around, Jimmy.  Don't turn around.  I respect the guy's military service.  I respect the guy.  He's a bright dude.  He's not a dumb guy.  He's just more radical than I am.  But that, when you're arguing and that disagreeing, that fucking...  Like, that's all of a sudden the atomic bomb.  I'm going to use my...  Fuck you, man.  You know what you should do?  Bend him over and humble him.  You fuck in the ass.  I fuck you in the ass and humble you.  I don't care if he...  That little shit.  That's what I think of you, you big fat motherfucker.  Beat it. 
[04:02:30]  There was a point...  No, I'm sorry.  Anthony, there was a point when Jimmy turned all the way around.  Jesse was at the doorway.  Jesse was debating...  I'm coming back in.  So much.  Oh, yeah, he was.  No, I'm just saying.  I know he was.  I'm just painting the picture for everyone.  There was a moment there where Jesse's like...  I think I've got to go back in there and hit this guy.  I was scared for you.  And then, at the last second, turned and walked away.  Because when he drank his water and finished the bottle, I thought he was going to throw  the bottle in the face.  And I would have thrown mine at him and got the shit beat out of me.  Believe me.  Oh, my God.  That's what I was thinking.  That's why I started getting afraid.  And then Kenny would have had to come in and... 
[04:03:00]  Oh, it would have been awful.  Kenny.  I want to talk to Kenny for a minute.  I want to know what Kenny was thinking.  I've been boxing lately.  I would have tried something.  Dude, I'm more...  Would you knock it off?  Dude, I would be annoyed at a small guy for pushing the microwave during an argument.  Right.  But Jesse was having a lot of time to say what he had to say.  Yeah.  We were arguing back and forth.  He felt I put words in his mouth.  I felt he put words in mine.  But then to drop it like that, goodbye.  I know.  Fuck you.  Goodbye.  We're promoting your show for the last 20 minutes.  Ask plenty of legitimate questions. 
[04:03:30]  Yes.  Let him get his point across over and over again.  Oh, it drives me crazy.  Kenny, where would have been that fail-safe point where you had to jump in?  Because you held off.  You didn't do anything.  You didn't get in between anybody.  What were you thinking during that whole thing?  I was keeping my eye on him.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Now, what would you think if you had to go against Jesse Ventura?  Bye, Jim.  Ronnie B's in studio.  We almost lost Jimmy today, Ronnie. 
[04:04:00]  I swear to God, true story.  I'm downstairs and saw Ventura go through the turnstiles twice.  He just kept...  I'm not even fucking making it up.  He just kept walking around and pushing it.  I guess he was pushing it so hard he didn't realize  how to get out.  Fuck him.  He was angry.  I fucking hate bullies.  Jimmy, you didn't serve.  Jesus Christ.  You know what?  In that argument, that drives me nuts, too,  because I'm not one of these...  I have nothing but respect for the military,  and I've said it 50 times. 
[04:04:30]  Pull them out of everywhere.  Fuck the rest of the world.  Don't get our guys killed for fucking North Korea or anybody.  Fuck all of them.  Oh, it makes me sick.  It was amazing, Ronnie.  Holy shit.  He did that last time.  The look that Jesse gave, the look that Jimmy gave.  That's a pretty good impression.  There was some crazy looks going on.  Wow.  Well, I guess everyone's going to tune in to his show tonight.  Hey, watch the show.  It's probably a good show.  As long as you don't watch it Thursday through Sunday  when I'm at Caroline.  I don't care what you do.  And the video was angry. 
[04:05:00]  The video of the confrontation later on this afternoon.  Oh, you've got to see this one.  Holy shit.  I had to turn my head at one point.  I was scared.  I did not want to see you get hit.  Not that I didn't want to see it happen.  I literally did not want to see it.  So I turned away thinking you absolutely were going to get fucking clocked.  It was intense, too, because of the video.  And I go whispering to Sam,  get closer, get closer.  And Sam's like,  no, fuck no.  Oh, you got a fucking close-up of him?  It's got a zoom lens open. 
[04:05:30]  Show Ronnie B the look.  The good thing, though,  is if you would have got hit,  it would have been a fake hit,  where they hit their phone.  And then if you needed to,  you could just start going like this  until the audience got behind you.  We'd all start clapping.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hold some signs up.  Oh, jeez.  You see that look?  Let me see your hair.  That stupid hairdo.  Jimmy, everyone's saying bravo.  Simple as that.  It's not even that.  Oh, I know.  I would never come at the guy physically.  You know what?  You stood up for a lot of people out there  that have been in that situation  with a big, tough guy.  And you know what?  You fucking stood right in there with the guy. 
[04:06:00]  Because I would never yell at a guy  who weighed 100 pounds.  That's why people are saying bravo today.  Like, I would never,  I don't bully people who are smaller than me.  Because most people in your situation  walk away.  Trust me, they just do.  You have no choice  and you walk away.  Bully stalker Patty.  I'm always nice to stalker Patty.  That was a pussy.  I gave her orgasm.  He made him defend himself.  That was amazing.  I love Patty.  That was amazing.  I love her.  I love her.  I love the girl.  She's fantastic.  All right, we've got to go home, man.  All right.  We're into Ron and Fez time.  Sorry, done.  We're calling off today anyway.  Is that it?  Yeah, Fez is upset.  What happened?  His wig was on backwards 
[04:06:30]  and everybody was laughing.  How do you tell?  How do you tell is right.  He crawled.  He loves you.  I love Fez too.  I'm kidding you.  I adore Fez.  He has a wicker basket on his head.  It's amazing when I see Fez walk in  with that wig on his head  knowing he's got a full head of hair under there  and he wears that wig  that you know everybody is going,  what is he doing?  That's irony.  That's the beauty of that bit.  It's irony.  That is the beauty of it.  It's complete irony.  But shouldn't this end at some point?  Well, he feels... 
[04:07:00]  Is that like a security blanket now?  Like Linus in his blanket?  I don't know.  It's Fez in his wig?  Yeah.  The beauty is no one knows he's gay under there.  Oh, Jesus.  Hi, Fez.  Hi, Fez.  He's joking.  Now we heard his name.  We almost lost Jimmy.  What does the wig talk about?  Fez the body of Ventura.  He looks like the Davy Jones.  I kind of like it.  He looks like a beetle.  I could never go in the military.  A long lost beetle.  I won't cut my hair.  That is a great look.  We don't talk about anyone else's hair replacement system.  Ever. 
[04:07:30]  Ever.  Ram, yo.  Are you kidding?  Are you kidding?  I did it.  The individual follicles placed in the direction the natural hair grows.  So are mine.  I see.  So the direction the hair grows in a hurricane.  I mean, I like it.  What's wrong?  I like it.  It looks good.  Hyderides, you're mysterious.  You kind of look like a dark horse performer.  I like it.  And it's got a perfect part.  You never have to worry about coming.  I like it the other way, though.  It kind of works for you.  Can you stop sideways?  Turn up just a little bit because that's the part that you've been jizzed in. 
[04:08:00]  There, that's better.  He's got the emo look now.  They're really hard to shampoo.  Did you hear that exchange, anything, with Jimmy and Jesse?  Oh, yeah.  Monday Night Raw.  It really was.  You might have to walk around the building a couple more times.  That was intense, Fezzy.  That's what Ventura's doing right now.  Yeah, I'm sure he is.  If Vez was actually with him, we saw him going through the revolving door.  It was twice.  He kept going through the revolving door.  He was waiting for his entry music. 
[04:08:30]  He was debating if he could come back up here, I guess.  I should kick his ass.  All right, we got to go.  Yeah, thanks for being a proud American, Jim.  Exactly.  Beat it.  Don't touch me, shithead.  Beat it.  All right.  Fucking take your toys and leave.  I think we did enough damage.  I think we did all right today.  God, am I glad he didn't hit me.  I'm very proud of you.  I'm so happy he didn't hit me.  Dude, I was so scared.  You got a great poker face.  You should be playing poker.  I wasn't afraid of him.  In hindsight, I would be a broken-jawed man.  People are going to kill me.  But in that moment, you're just so irritated. 
[04:09:00]  Yeah, he was.  It's not bravery either.  Believe me, it's not.  My bladder's going to explode.  It's utter stupidity on your part.  That's bravery.  Give me your wig, Fez.  I got to pay.  I'm dying over here.  All right, we're out.  Ron and Fez next.  Stay tuned, obviously. </pre>
