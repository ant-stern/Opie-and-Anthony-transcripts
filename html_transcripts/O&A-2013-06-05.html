<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton sampling a massive delivery of popcorn from Popcorn Buddha in Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania.  They hilariously reviewed numerous bizarre flavors, from cinnamon toast to hot wings,  a thank you gift from the shop for the show's publicity.  The discussion veered into their experiences with advertisers and past instances of "plugola."  The show then covered a news story about a high school senior denied entry to prom because of her large breasts, prompting crude jokes.  Further comedic fodder came from a segment on two Philadelphia news anchors who visibly disliked each other, and a debunking of a Domino's drone pizza delivery video.  The firing of a Taco Bell employee for licking taco shells was also discussed.  Upcoming guests Jay Mohr, Ethan Hawke, and David Lee Roth were announced, along with promotion of their podcast, including a recent episode featuring Courtney Love and "The Baby Bird Saga."  The segment concluded with a comedic bit featuring Pat Cooper discussing erectile dysfunction.

Next, the hosts opened a box of promotional items, including "One Wipe Charlies," razors, shave butter, and various food products, leading to more crude jokes and nonsensical banter.  A lengthy interview followed with Jackie, a "batshit crazy" intern from Rochester who had briefly worked for "Wheeze," a radio personality.  Jackie shared outrageous anecdotes from her life, including a police car incident.  Her wealthy parents and her landscaper boyfriend were also discussed.  Another intern, Sydney from Florida, was briefly interviewed for comparison.

Ethan Hawke then joined the show to promote "The Purge," discussing the film's plot, masks, his acting experiences, awards, opinions on British actors, and on-screen kissing.  The conversation returned to "The Purge" and the upcoming appearance of David Lee Roth, interspersed with product plugs and inside jokes.

David Lee Roth was interviewed next, beginning with a story about fans jumping off pickup truck bumpers after Van Halen shows.  He discussed Van Halen's career as a series of increasingly risky challenges, their resistance to outside influence, and their unique musical style.  He detailed his film projects, including a gangster film in Japan with a Sumo wrestler, and his extensive back tattoo.  Doc Gooden then joined, discussing his memoir, his struggles with addiction, his career highs and lows, including missing the World Series parade due to substance abuse, his time in rehab and prison, and the pressures of his career.  The conversation included discussions of sponsors' products and concluded with a song, "Monkey Time," sparking a discussion about Roth's musical influences.

Doc Gooden’s interview continued with a detailed account of his prison experience, including witnessing a violent assault. He reflected on the pressures of his career, his addiction stemming partly from guilt over unmet expectations, and how prison gave him perspective. He also promoted his book, "Doc."  The show also featured numerous listener calls covering a wide range of personal issues: a caller whose cousin’s marriage was volatile, a caller with a clingy girlfriend, a caller struggling with addiction and suicidal thoughts (who received support from Jim Norton), a caller whose son exhibited sexually inappropriate behavior, a caller whose fiancée left, and callers struggling with depression and unemployment, and a relapse after 17 years of sobriety.  Jim Norton provided advice and commentary throughout, often sharing personal anecdotes.  Jay Mohr was also mentioned as a guest.

Finally, a segment focused on a call from Patrick, who relapsed after 17 years of sobriety.  Opie and Anthony offered encouragement, urging him to contact his sponsor and attend a meeting, recalling seeing him at a comedy show and their Brazil trip.  The show concluded with a brief mention of Jim Norton's show.

[00:17:30]  home thanks what are you who are you handing this to there's fucking nothing in it  there's a few crumbs left a used condom thanks  see how easy it is to get advertisers it's so easy  it's easy to get advertisers that don't actually pay for advertising yeah but the point is that  it works we're proving advertising works uh-huh what was my popcorn story maybe five boring minutes  five boring minutes and it leads to this a huge box of fucking popcorn from popcorn buddha just 
[00:18:00]  wonderful that means that that means their phones were ringing off the hook after after that if it  was yeah it had to they have online ordering right yeah yeah they probably got a lot of that do they  have bigger sizes in this i would assume so yeah okay man plug all's got come a long way it used to  be like cocaine and fucking cash and envelopes and now it's right popcorn it was pretty much just 
[00:18:30]  used to be called payola payola before plugola it was payola and that was just cash you want your  record played pay me yeah ronnie b's got some great plugola stories i wouldn't doubt it he he hinted  that you know when it was time to give away the u2 trip to ireland oh yeah he might have known the  winner just kind of worked out that way i think that's the story he told a coincidence yeah when  did they get here in florida oh old school radio when when the you know the radio companies would 
[00:19:00]  put together those great amazing fucking trips let's say black sabbath in england or whatever  when look at jimmy it would all be you know they would they would push it hard on the radio station  but in the end they sort of always knew the winner that was good man and then uh who got involved  with that shit the government elliot spitzer did in new york well that's what that's that was late  in the game but they shut it down way before that it was a long time ago like alan freed got in trouble 
[00:19:30]  for that yeah back in the old yeah fucking 50s 60s did he yeah they swooped in what kind of trouble  did he get i don't know they didn't fire him right uh they might have i think they did i think he might  have fucking had criminal charges look at that sam alan free that's interesting yeah yeah the ramones  mentioned him in the song that that that and alan free that's all i know about alan free was very  big uh dj back in the day broke a lot of uh the uh classic early rock acts on the radio but it was 
[00:20:00]  through a lot of payola i think the payola scandal was written right down there right keep going  where did i see it legal trouble payola scandal what does it say there sam robbins in 1958 freed  faced controversy in boston when he told the audience the police don't want you to have fun  as a result freed was arrested and charged with inciting a riot wow um freed's career ended when  it was shown that he had accepted payola payments from record companies to play specific records 
[00:20:30]  a practice that was highly controversial at the time but not illegal there was also a  ended his career in the 50s yeah they they somehow made it illegal i don't think it was illegal and he  was also uh taking songwriting credit co-credits which entitled him to uh receive part of the song's  royalties jesus and then he would play the records a lot more that's that's fucking great guy was smart  smart guy pencil me in on that fucking record motherfucker yeah isn't that what the jew did 
[00:21:00]  on fucking um in uh the sopranos right oh yeah uh yeah yeah hesh hesh hesh would put his name on  the fucking writing credit and uh pocket the money yeah yeah hesh don't you think we gotta find a  lung for this 10 year old girl now that she's like a national story uh probably yeah they'll probably  now that it's a national story you just gotta i mean she's lucky enough that she made the national 
[00:21:30]  headlines i'm sure there's a lot of a lot of kids that are suffering the same fate as sarah but now  she's on fox news right now she's what 10 and needs a lung transplant but she's too young to get it or  something what's she got no she they they're not eligible for adult lungs i think right the only  juvenile lungs and i think if they said putting all the kids on the adult lung list would only add like  20 people to a 1600 person list but when you you so your odds are better if you get it if you're 
[00:22:00]  allowed to get an adult lung i think so okay so that's what the problem is i don't know what the  motive is behind it but i know that the the organization spoke up and uh they said they  can't do it but at this point you gotta because now we all know sarah screw that what about britney  minder she's a high school senior whose tits are too big apparently what prom cover-up team turned away  well a district spokesperson says staff helps students come up with a solution if they don't  meet dress code and check out this incredible trick shots are too big oh my trick shots on tv

[00:23:30]  be a full-time job for somebody right they have to fucking sit there monitor what's on the screen  and then the various logos and fucking takers and everything and then move it if you need it on  there so badly by the way no one gives a fuck no i don't give i don't give a fuck that the trick shot  was on your news channel i don't care you'll see it online yeah what about the busty broad i guess uh  her dress you know the it was inappropriate dress attire but not for what she was wearing it's the fact

[00:35:30]  shoulders are up in the air he's all stressed out his body language no father wants to discuss as  he's discussing his girls no little girl's tits no father wants to discuss his little girl's  tits enough about the tits right we got uh speaking of the news we got some news anchors that hate each  other oh yeah this thing's going viral is it out of philly i guess yeah cbs i've watched a lot of 
[00:36:00]  news in philly i've never seen that hot anchor before is she hot yeah yeah she's hot she's uh  she looks like the video uh she looks like uh kunis there a little bit oh yeah a little bit and uh  and then you got this old bra that does the weather this blonde jack mac carol carol is the old boy  old broad and it seems like uh she's a bit jealous that um the news uh station hired this piece of  ass wow anchor well the anchor is also i think she's a former beauty pageant yeah she's ridiculous 
[00:36:30]  she's really really beautiful yeah yeah there there she is right there let's go oh wow oh what do we  got here well hello there what oh where did you come from hi oh it's the coal brewer what's going  on here yeah can we play from there should we play it from over here clips are better this is all  just kind of a montage you like your clips on the cd you're probably yeah okay so get a good look at

[00:37:30]  face and the other one's a meteorologist who's probably been at the station or in philly forever  i would assume yeah i think the meteorologist probably wanted the anchor gig and then they  hired this piece of ass for it and nicole the piece of ass is sitting there like fuck this old broad  yeah yeah i'm hot and i'm great right so they hate each other hate both you can tell and the anchors  they don't respect the weather people no they barely respect the sports people chad that's a prime 
[00:38:00]  example carol if you let me talk let me talk the parametric pressure was going up by 0.5 in the  afternoon but that's what you want to hear at your job we were just kidding no you weren't you weren't  kidding each other yeah an honest moment you douche she thinks you're a bore and who yammers on about  things people don't care about and you think she's a cunt just say it iraq you got the shot clip katrina's  barreling into fucking uh new orleans he's like like the news wants to be all over it right but 
[00:38:30]  with something exciting you know and he's quoting minute by minute barometric pressure and the anchor  couldn't take it she saw the audience fucking you know switching over to some other news network and  called him out on it and uh they had chat all over oklahoma city trying to find it oh really oh yeah  chad's still working for cns and he was on the phone uh all day friday and saturday i think trying  to find a tornado oh it didn't work out no and i it sounded like he was in a van just chasing he 
[00:39:00]  just needed to get close to one of these you know who he needed with him huh the rabbit the rabbit is  wise yes rabbit the extreme dusty yes needed them all oh who's the rabbit the rabbit is wise  oh yeah my head just tingling i know it's one of the douchiest lines who's the rabbit who was the  rabbit oh i think the rabbit was a little skinny kid dude he said the rabbit is wise yeah he's the  guy that was able to read the fucking radar and shit like that and figure out where the tornado was 
[00:39:30]  going to go but you combine that kind of science with just the pure instincts of the extreme  and that's what made a perfect oh the rabbit was from risky business cameron from yeah yeah yeah  i mean uh first bueller yeah jesus christ okay that line risky business can we look at that like  i'm literally my head is tingling it's so bad yeah the rabbit yeah first bueller of course alan ruck  yeah wasn't he uh in speed two yeah not speed two the movie speed the first one right i don't know 
[00:40:00]  rabbit rabbit tracks rabbit tracks i don't know right there oh they got their little convoy going  there's dorothy in the back of the red truck boy and all roads lead back to twister don't they  oh look at this big sweeping fucking camera view with a convoy  okay rabbit time to impress me okay we're gonna take a walk in the woods 
[00:40:30]  yeah the rabbit time to impress me this is fucking good why are they driving like assholes  cool song you like this fuck yeah sounds a lot like um it's heavy yeah  rabbit rabbit what are you doing oh this is the worst movie ever made do they call him rabbit oh yeah 
[00:41:00]  they all got their nicknames rabbit dusty uh who's the other one douchey and twat dusty  uh-oh they're just too extreme 
[00:41:30]  i i i i what did he say i don't know i'm not trying to understand how excited they are  that's the farm can you serve up uh yeah trust me rabbit is good rabbit is wise  nice ow that's what i'm talking about rabbit is good the rabbit is what he's talking about himself  by the way right there i can't i can't i can't look at anybody i can't look at anybody that was 
[00:42:00]  a good one embarrassed to be in the room that was i'm too embarrassed to be in a world where i know  that exists humiliated no that line should be on a t-shirt the rabbit is good the rabbit is wise  nice that's what i'm talking about rabbit is good the rabbit is why oh you just don't you think you  had identified every douchey line from twister years later new ones just pop out all over the place the  rabbit is good the rabbit is wise you sure about that yeah i'm sure about it well that leads us to 
[00:42:30]  chad and carol fighting chad and it leads us to the the two people fighting in philly but first uh  chad and carol but the storm was nine hundred and two bill of bars 902 was the lowest that you had with  this storm a couple of hours ago so it has filled in a little bit filled in with some air not as low  of pressure but camille let me talk carol translate that for us i don't know what that means what does that 
[00:43:00]  well if you would let me talk camille camille was 908 and so this is actually now not as strong as  camille but not really as strong as it's been 908 i'm walking over here because you're um i can have  this chart but it's not in front of me 908 millibars is 26.81 inches of mercury this storm got down to 26.61 
[00:43:30]  what right now it's 26.98 now if you would go to your home barometer that you have it's probably a  big circle hanging on the wall that you got from an uncle somewhere if you go look at that that is  completely off the screen rarely would you ever have to have a barometer that would go that low  in the northern hemisphere unless you were obviously trying to get under a hurricane all right thank you  chad all right just having fun with you this morning just having fun with you this morning here i  i broke that down carol is a real bitch if you watch of course of course she is i used to hate uh chad 
[00:44:00]  more in that clip but he's an idiot yeah he's not funny like like like but she's a real twat  chad if you'll let me and then he totally got flustered and it's 900 millibars  inches of mercury i he's very passionate about weather oh he certainly the problem is people watching  weather are not as passionate no you know what they could just like they have that discussion  that's all we give a fuck he had that same discussion with other meteorologists like in 
[00:44:30]  the back and stuff and they were all like creaming on each other probably on a message somewhere yes  and it was the most exciting shit they've ever heard and then he tries to take it to the news  and he just gets emasculated right he gets castrated  oh they uh they're going with these clips on morning joe oh it's a viral video today so  it leads us to philly rolling her eyes oh yeah okay all right i see that there's some problem  there in the visual uh side of it leads us to philly cbs philadelphia news anchor doesn't get along 
[00:45:00]  with the weather girl they shouldn't say weather girl yeah i i didn't know how to what the word for  a mature weather girl was a very mature weather girl that's that soup is done oh  oh christ all right after that we like that with a couple of shower chances by the time we get to  wednesday thursday and friday and thanks for the uh hard to get applause nicole and kevin yes how's that  carol is that good enough for you okay i'll try a little harder next time thanks so much you hear in 
[00:45:30]  the background lackluster how's that who said lackluster the hot chick carol carol she's not  the hot chick no the old broad doing the weather the old brood the meteorologist yeah right who's  too old to be doing uh news she's lucky she still has a gig yeah well the girls are usually you know  the nice younger one yeah the chippies yeah yeah yeah when that hot chick got the desk it got the anchor  desk right she had to know that's it i'm not going to become a news anchor ever it's not 
[00:46:00]  end of career yeah ozzy is a father of 12 he has nine grandchildren and two great grandchildren  wow good for ozzy now it may be his birthday but carol when it comes to the weather we want  no monkey business okay all good things it's 49 degrees in philadelphia nicole uh we have a temperature  of 30 i guess i'll do the monkey uh 38 degrees up through the allentown area yeah they hate each 
[00:46:30]  other ozzy was a gorilla and she tried to make a little pun there right good so i'm glad the other  girl didn't give her anything and now that now that this has become a national thing and it's viral  watch that the station will fucking separate these two instead of knowing they got something and let  these two get all nice you know bicker each other every fucking day or they'll just make sure that  they're overly nice to each other and they smile right oh people think we don't like each other i  guess we should take out the swords back to you damp weather not anything nearly as great as it will 
[00:47:00]  be this weekend nicole well carol i would say that forecast is bananas but i know that's completely  wasted on you so i won't be taking it back right now all right changing gears  the weather's moist unlike your vagina which hasn't seen moisture in years right  back to you carol back to you and nicole strikes me as fearless because she's so hot 
[00:47:30]  nobody's ever told her you're doing something bad no she's lacking in the boob category is she yeah  they did a side shot that's all right though in the news uh anchor industry for weather or traffic girl  you need those big fucking tits like tits so big that dad's got to talk about them those are big  tits uh how humiliating that's great my daughter my busty daughter my little girl had to leave the 
[00:48:00]  prom because of her juicy tits an anchor girl though she could have smaller tits carol i understand you  have some good news and possibly a halo behind you possibly a halo nicole of course it always comes  into question when it hits you and a halo and i know isn't it odd that i'm the one always carrying  this halo around uh well we have a beautiful star i don't even know what that's fine they don't hate 
[00:48:30]  each other it's just dumb news banter yeah well there's like a halo looking thing behind her oh it  was the sun it was passionate because she's saying that she's not good right you know she's like yeah  but that's again that's something you say oh a halo behind you you would say it but there's an  underlining tone right yeah just no not in the context of all these other of these two hating yeah  6 30 let's give you a check on weather with meteorologist carol erickson in the weather center  it's just perfect out there it's wonderful lovely like you yes exactly it's how i would describe it 
[00:49:00]  it's me too yeah i knew you would be cool here at the end say i knew you would yeah yeah yeah meaning  i knew you would think you were lovely and the the saying each other's names yeah that's very  passive aggressive right there yes yes oh my god i can see you pulling that whole don't you know who i am  come on you said you could i could see you doing it oh yeah you don't know me at all 
[00:49:30]  you don't know who i don't you see uh yes uh that that was an interesting little exchange i'm sure  she regrets along with that last glass of whatever  i think she means uh reese yeah i hate to be the party pooper and the guy with the giant  cock in the room you're right but i think she's talking about reese with the school  not not her not her i think she regrets that last exchange in the last glass or whatever  she's she's referring to reese with absolutely yeah i don't i i think you can see there's a 
[00:50:00]  little tension but i don't think that they really hate each other i mean uh i haven't heard it yet  carol oh great story right nicole do you notice i don't see anything you didn't  no call any attention to it i um i didn't call attention to it because i know you don't see it  it's my halo it's been manufactured let's just put it that way it's awful and you have to call  attention to your own halo it's the only way you're gonna get it that's right somehow 
[00:50:30]  and then the little laughter yeah i mean this could be kind of a hey we got something going  here let's run but they didn't have it i'm not convinced i think they're trying to keep it  under control so what you're hearing yeah yeah i i i hear hate each other i hear hate but they  can't just have a cat fight right because they know it'll be their jobs yeah at least one of their  jobs in news land the fact that they're even saying that much is right what yeah exactly 
[00:51:00]  uh all right there's another viral video today it's the dominoes thing don't buy into that  shit that's just a fake fucking video they're not they're not thinking about using drones to  deliver your pizza they might be thinking about it but but they're they're showing it like it's  happening right right it's not happening it's not happening they did the same thing on tuesday when  they were like burger king's got whopper things but you don't need to use that was obviously it was  publicity all the hands-free whopper whatever thing yeah why can't the news like break it down 
[00:51:30]  it's fun dominoes is pretty damn smart they uh made this video it's a drone with a pizza box and  they're like yeah we're considering uh delivering pizzas with drones no they're not the that'd be  extremely expensive it would be like and not efficient the technology with these kind of little rc jobs  isn't there yet to carry that much weight right to um go any real long distance right uh and they're 
[00:52:00]  showing like this guy shoving pizza in a one of those pizza boxes a couple of pizzas right that  thing would be pretty weighted down right to fucking take two goddamn pizzas two pizzas are pretty heavy  yeah and what does the headline say it says it's a great marketing video yeah fox news and it says  fox news domino's pizza testing pizza delivering drones no they're not no they're getting a viral  marketing publicity video right it's a viral video that they're putting out but uh they show it going 
[00:52:30]  very far that's obviously multiple clips of right the thing the the guy with the radio control might as  well just have the pizza and bring it because he's following along with it sure it's there's nothing in  the article that says it's just a obviously just viral marketing it says domino's pizza hired a creative  agency called t plus biscuits to test the feasibility of octocopter drones that deliver a hot delicious 
[00:53:00]  pizza to your door no that's not what they hired him no no not at all no they hired him as a publicity  thing we need a viral video can you make one and they did the news is from you know talking about  this like it's a possibility but like everything else in the news this is the more interesting story  this is the one where they'll go oh people will be talking about this drones they love drones and  delivering pizza this will be like people will imagine like the sky's full of fucking pizza drones  and that's the story that they want to put across regardless of what the truth is so that's how the 
[00:53:30]  news works with everything right whatever the story is that's more interesting that they think is  going to get the buzz uh that will will get more um press than than the real story which is you know  uh maybe they're just looking into a viral video so stupid it is stupid and that leads us to another  fast food joint taco bell i guess they're gonna fire the the the kid that was licking the shells shell 
[00:54:00]  liquor they suspended him and plan on firing him so i guess they got to go through hr and all that  to make sure the firing is proper if you if you're tonguing the fucking yeah  tonguing the product and putting it online you're gone fired and that's not a viral marketing video  no no no no i don't think taco bell put that out they're not happy falcon saw that and falcon said  that guy's goose is cooked oh shit falcon yeah that's my nickname 
[00:54:30]  he's talking in third person about himself as falcon falcon wants to hear this clip is falcon  good falcon's wise oh falcon's douche sam play this falcon wants to see no clip oh oh i thought  it was a clip uh shell licking employee an isolated incident taco bell claims that they claim what else  could they claim it's a widespread epidemic we're trying to quell it now please don't buy any more 
[00:55:00]  taco bell till we figure this out we've taken it out of our employee training video right right where  we told people to lick the shell this what a dumb statement but this became a thing these these  idiot kids are making no money at these fast food joints and figured out oh my god we could get viral  videos going by doing some ridiculous shit and that's what were some of the other ones that popped up  over the last few years i'm trying to remember didn't wasn't there a kfc one where they they did some with 
[00:55:30]  their feet i thought well that's the guy that uh stood in the lettuce the shred lettuce yeah and then  then a guy took a bath in the sink that's what it was yeah burger king burger king took a bath in  the sink right what's the big deal there well you don't want to be naked in the sink that you're using  in a public fucking but it's a sink yeah what does that have to do with the food i think there's a  couple others out there yeah it's the fucking place they cook the food it's not supposed to be naked  falcon doesn't want to eat in a place where people oh god  now we got to deal with falcon on top of all the other people are coming here every day 
[00:56:00]  holy i can't keep up  we're doing this radio show with 20 people it is amazing uninvited guests of the show yeah yeah  falcon just flies in oh he does come on there was another fast food video that was hot a couple years  ago i was way worse i think than the kid in the sink really i think so oh fuck 
[00:56:30]  the beauty of the show the listeners will come up with it if yeah if there is one  yeah so the taco bell kid is getting fired and what is this getting fired and suspended and this  and that like with a shitty job like that they probably it was it was like when when i was working  at these shitty jobs like that if you did something you just got fired get out of here  it's the new world we live in they're going to sit him down and make sure no one else is licking the  taco shell licking the taco shell they want to protect themselves against any lawsuit they're doing a 
[00:57:00]  full investigation before they fire the kid it's obvious that's old days they just fired you they  did they just said get out anymore man you're fired like the old school bosses fired you sure we got a  busy show today by the way yeah i know we already began our show but it's going to get even busier  uh jay moore's coming in today in about a half hour oh jay moore's also ethan hawk is coming in at  eight o'clock he's uh what is he promoting he's in that movie the purge where they uh let you commit

[01:41:00]  other at a knicks game a few times with your beautiful son oh thanks no they didn't win  because nate robinson was there oh yeah oh boy that's when they had the all green jerseys on for  safe i do remember that yeah it was you on one side of me and kerry washington on the other side of me  and i went if a bomb hits this row i'm not even in the article  ethan hawk and others died and others uh ethan's got uh the purge the purge this movie's got a lot 
[01:41:30]  of heat right now it's opening uh what friday june 7th this uh this friday this friday all right and uh  this is a real interesting concept uh one day a year people can do whatever the hell they want as far as  uh illegal stuff goes including murder the the idea is it takes place uh you know in like in the  near future after the great depression of 2017 and and uh as the nation recovers to bring down 
[01:42:00]  unemployment uh and to purge the nation of its national hate uh one day a year the government  shuts down no hospitals no cops no nothing and you can do whatever you want in this way if you get  screwed in the land deal you don't need to worry about it you don't need to get a lawyer you don't  need to sue you just wait for the purge day and you kill the guy right this sounds fantastic your  wife is driving you crazy she's getting on your nerves don't sweat it wait for purge night i serve 
[01:42:30]  right and so now the good news about this is that uh unemployment drops to zero sure right because  basically all the unemployed people kill each other and uh it's a a little bit influenced when i was  younger i remember did you guys see escape from new york oh of course yeah right snake plissken and  everything yeah it's the same kind of john carpenter-esque uh half thriller half horror half um  socio-political document because what it really is is it's like any good science fiction it's not really 
[01:43:00]  that science fiction you know it you know the woman is on the treadmill and she's jogging and  on tv you know outside her gated community people are killing each other right right but it's not that  different from the way we actually what's really happening right i hope there's no 80s bad guy though  like the guy who was like uh the president we have the president remember that guy with the billy idol  haircut oh yeah this is a kid in this movie um who is i think the best bad guy i've ever been a part  of yeah his performance was phenomenal yeah um unfortunately he'll never work again he's so scary 
[01:43:30]  so so now once a year this happens now your character your family guy well see this is where  you get it gets kind of interesting i am extremely affluent man who is a family guy who has made a  fortune selling security systems so he's very safe you know he's living in this gated community yes you  know machine guys all the bells and whistles you need to fend off these uh nuts my son thinks this 
[01:44:00]  purge is immoral my son's giving me some kind of ethics class about how it's really not fair to the  poor people it's really not fair that we just because we're rich we get safe and we get special  privileges how is that fair sounds like me every day of the week when i talk about taxes and exactly  and so my son ends up made letting a guy a safe house in our house and trouble is this guy is very  seriously wanted by the nazi youth of america ah the social network going bad these other guys start 
[01:44:30]  coming after him in our house and so right puts all your good gear to the test i guess they're all  like young youthful nazis that are coming after him well not literally i know but they're they're  like they're beautiful yeah well no the today's version of skinheads which is like computer geek  preppy people all right does that make sense to you because oh you seem lost here and where did i  lose here no i'm actually just thinking of the people he's talking about yeah yeah yeah well i have 
[01:45:00]  a question yeah uh when i see the promos there's people wearing masks like spooky masks breaking into  houses that's got to be like the longest pre-production meeting more than casting is  figuring out what mask to settle on because if done right like scream the mask lives in perpetuity yeah  people running around in a nixon mask like johnny utah  i'll take your comments off the air  governors tonight i think that uh a lot of thought did go into the mask but 
[01:45:30]  that the director had seen this certain mask uh long before production started doesn't that creep  you out about your director that he's looking at masks before the movie came like ah you know i  just combed the internet look at masks when you read the script i was already creeped out by this guy  well done that's uh yeah that sounds pretty good i saw the trailer um in the theater when i was  seeing i think a star trek or something and it looks uh it looks pretty badass yeah it's pretty cool 
[01:46:00]  it turned out it turned out pretty good so there's an explanation as to why people don't  because like i think like if that was happening i would just get in the car and  go to a lake somewhere and just wait until the next day because some hillbilly at the lake will have  you that's why you can't do that have you ever seen the movies i mean  too much a lake is safe that's a good point yeah lakes are disaster you don't want to be caught  out there on the road defenseless i just find myself a nice spooky cabin in the woods next to  an old lake with a sign up front what says abandoned yeah yeah exactly go hide out in an 
[01:46:30]  abandoned hospital that's a good one i'm just a sweet i'm a sweet naive boy i don't know anybody  it's sort of like hitting the herd jimmy's looking yeah jimmy is very fit jimmy used to look like uh  for your own uh stand-up special you said you look like a scallop yeah i was in bad shape and now  you look uh like completely fit or you're dying to your room i just i'm sick of paying for it  sex yeah oh okay i'm sick of it i thought you meant like figuratively paying for your poor health 
[01:47:00]  no no no i don't stay figuratively you're talking about the hookers i'm tired of paying for  pussy there's no hidden meaning there oh jesus christ so uh yeah so he lost 30 pounds man  about that looking good 25 or 30. 25 to 30. this is a nice family show yeah i know right yeah  i don't care isn't getting killed by it well you know it's terrible it's way worse than that actually  getting killed by a lady so now you must get into some pretty uh bad situations there you got to 
[01:47:30]  defend the family right because i'm assuming at some point it's not just this guy's wanted  and it's in this house and then it ends going well the house held up again yeah you know something  there's probably a breach i have a pretty terrifying line in the movie where the wife screams you know but  we're safe right and he's sick well oh well you mean safe oh you know it's a relative term yeah 
[01:48:00]  these things are uh more for show you know people are intimidated by right so it's all hell break  does break loose for sure how does the movie end how does the movie you know we can i'll come back  on in a month and we can talk about it and then discuss yeah even when you you're like i was a huge  star training day you should have been nominated for training day i was you were nominated so read  the wikipedia no you don't mind man google my name how hard is it you were nominated for a source 
[01:48:30]  award for training day that's right you fucking mother you didn't even fucking let me finish you  screen actor that awesome jesus christ i didn't even get my fucking source awards out yeah  the guy was a very urban movie you should have been nominated for source award i know i was they  they they did i was who won that year i was hurt well denzel won for best actor right yeah i don't  know who won don't act like you don't know what you want to know something what's up i have no idea  really yeah wait what year was that careless what year was it come on careless uh 2002 you know the 
[01:49:00]  year but you don't know who won you don't know who you watched go to the podium jesus what what you  you you know people you you would be crazy would it you know what i don't have to worry about it  i love that movie so much and i was sitting next to denzel washington and when i won uh he leaned  over to me and said yeah you don't want to win yet man whether you're older it'll mean so much more  and um and i remember i had such a great time that night and i i can't stand people crying over like 
[01:49:30]  not getting something awesome like that and it was some older british actor and i kind of secretly  um we in this country have an obsession with british actors we give them all kinds of awards and it  really annoys me yeah you're absolutely right it's strange it's like oh the british people they get  to win on brilliant oh yeah we think they're smarter because they have the accent yeah they all have  really bad breath well i don't know about that yeah you're hanging out with the wrong british 
[01:50:00]  actually scene with lord alfred hayes but yeah they they do they put them on these pedestals  yeah they win all these awards and it's like uh and so i i kind of resent that were you annoyed when  john gilgood won for arthur when he won supporting actor because that was a big uh surprise remember  that he won that was that best actor no no he won best supporting actor for that it was good  the media yeah exactly but he's right about the british actors that are really good but it does seem to  be that we think they're doing something amazing sometimes when they might not be 
[01:50:30]  people don't really respect their own or it it's a little bit i have to admit that they actually do  train their young people they have a culture we have a culture of celebrity and somebody shows a  little bit of talent and the next thing you know we pay them ten million dollars and next thing you  know they're committing suicide on some people magazine hopefully yeah yeah that's nice  ten million dollars you know but it is what happens and in england they show a little bit of talent they  do 59 shakespeare plays they're right right and then they get an oscar there's a protocol there 
[01:51:00]  that you got to go through you know while i'm doing a show on barrow streets all the way downtown  off broadway well they fucked they they fucked denzel on uh he's trying to do college one he didn't  win for malcolm x he didn't win for hurricane so what am i going to do for hurricane yeah yeah  malcolm x yeah was he played three different guys he lost to um pacino i think they gave a two percent of  a woman that year oh jimmy you don't mean that because they yeah yeah i think they owed him  for dog after that i'm not the jack of walkie and that feels spectacular and i'm gonna play joe paterno 
[01:51:30]  oh jerry what's going on in your front lawn here sorry i can't wait to see the movie the purge  it's friday yeah it's friday even the uh uh the bench ads like when you just see like on a bus going  by like the poster i go oh i gotta see that like rarely do you see like an actual photograph of the  movie and go oh this looks this looks good it's a great like concept like like it's not like oh i've 
[01:52:00]  seen this a thousand times no it's it's what we all want to do have one night we can go out and just  kill everybody who irritates us there's that fantasy aspect of it like yeah okay what do you think you  would be able to use that anthony oh my god let's just murder this room would be a lot more empty  jane instantly thinks it's him and he's right no i'm white and that's the mask right yeah that's 
[01:52:30]  a fucking scary mask holy that's kind of creepy do you uh are you big on like home security and stuff  you got cameras around the house and things like that no no you're pretty like laid out there you  know what i'm just i'm just constant i'm the type of this is pathetic and you're going to make fun of  me for this but he looks at jay yeah i'll be the judge of that yeah i forget codes i forget my keys  i'm like i'm this person who has the more high level the security system is the more often i'm locked  out of my house yeah i agree with ethan entirely yeah thank you thank you all right all right i like a 
[01:53:00]  little security a little are you pretty do you have video monitors are you the type of person that like  monitors you ever see panic room i have some cameras any photos up that you can show ethan  of your home how many how many security cameras you got he has gun turrets i don't have gun turrets  i got guns but i don't have turrets tell him how many security cameras i'm not sure i think i got 12.  he has drones all around the house yeah what are you hiding i'm not hiding anything with michael jackson  yeah okay it's the same lifestyle yeah he has sensors outside his door in case matoya shows 
[01:53:30]  up or not i don't have that i just kind of like the idea that i could take a peek around the house  especially if i'm gone like right now i could just kind of hit the my phone and hit the app and and  cameras come up and i'm like all right i kind of like i have a friend who videotapes the babysitter when  he's you know he'll go out oh yeah you gotta do that you can just click on his phone in the  bathrooms yeah of course i don't have a babysitter uh anthony really has like drones like he makes 
[01:54:00]  drones well i got a big yeah do you kill people with rc helicopter i wish it had the capability but  no i just record my neighbors uh they're probably not happy about it but i just buzz it up and down  the street into their driveways and he's like every randy quaid character in a film that's his  life just the the fucking creepy unshaven neighbor hold on miller they love me the asian guy that 
[01:54:30]  lives behind me he's fucking yelling the other night like you no just had someone in his house  and i heard a woman screaming and i heard like something being thrown around the so to get you  drawing up in the air for this and no no it was nighttime so and then he got went out by his patio  and just started heaving off his patio into the yard and yelling whoa god come on just  you know what you know what he needs to see the purge yeah this guy needs to see the purge  because he's up here yeah do the cops show up no no cops no cops it's that day it's purge day no 
[01:55:00]  cops no hospitals i'll say this i don't want to out you as uh being a cool guy uh ethan was with his uh  son at the next game never saw like a cooler involved dad ever just yeah well i've got a great son yeah  yeah yeah oh he's all right he's just cool he's all right what do you say i'm trying to give you  a compliment don't deflect you know does he drive no that's cool already you know that's yeah yeah  the merit but i will say this i've seen him around right completely cool hope he's seen

[01:56:00]  that you went to some place that that was you were there man that was a very intense scene with  smiley yeah uh he's from new zealand that guy yeah yeah from the chameleon he's like a new he's like  a maori and he can do any accent in the world he's incredible he's a great great actor yeah name  something it is what's his name yeah and i remember he he um hung out with all these uh a real mexican  gang the cholo gang he drove around with them and and for two weeks before the role and so on set 
[01:56:30]  the b we're sitting there playing cards you know and they steal my gun and i you know unload it  before you remember this whole thing the bo in this room okay i mean yeah when these guys like  are pretending to beat me up and they're not one of them had his parole officer on set and  we're doing the scene we're doing the scene cameras are rolling guy's cell phone goes off he answers  it he's like yeah uh filming the movie i don't know some white guy yeah i thought denzel's not here 
[01:57:00]  no it's boring yeah wow all right call you later hey you're okay you're okay let's keep going  holy shit actually you ever you ever pushed in yeah that that was an improv  yeah that was a good one it was a great scene it was really um but it was it did smell it was an  intense movie yeah the whole movie was a really really good one why was angelina jolie the best 
[01:57:30]  kiss on screen because like i don't like to ask like extra questions like that like  really dish out wow i've only kissed one girl on screen it was it was it turned what was it like  for you it turned me on i was surprised she was an ex-porn a porn star named nina hartley  and uh it turned me on a lot what was it that she did that that kind of got to you it was a it was a  comedy or was it because you were being filled were you were you because you were being filmed it was  particularly exciting no it was uh it was just because i i didn't i had never kissed a girl on camera 
[01:58:00]  it was like a 20 minutes short so i walked because she's a porn were you naked no we were fully dressed  in a comedy club against a bar okay okay so i said to her before before we shot i walk into the dressing  room and i go like like i've never kissed a girl on screen do we use tongue which sounds naive but i  don't want to be like the guy who's an asshole the porn girl and she's like yeah baby uh we're supposed  to be attracted to each other so she starts making out with me in the dressing room wow and then while  we're kissing on camera she's rubbing my cock and puts my hands on her tits and uh she was funny she  goes go ahead squeeze it you know you want to i'm like all right and i did and i was fiercely turned on 
[01:58:30]  this doesn't sound like a normal run-of-the-mill actress  but i'm saying yeah i'm getting a little sweaty over here the more you're talking about this but i  mean angelina jolie probably wouldn't play it like that but she's fucking yeah i think you could  take out probably you know she does that's uh but she seems sexy man in the changeling she made out  with the whole crew it was crazy yeah they claimed it to separate everybody it was nuts yeah you were  there for this look sweetheart you're making out with my camera up for 20 years uh so why was she the best 
[01:59:00]  well here's the thing you i think that maybe you may not be aware of this but you're talking to a  very i mean i want to i don't want to come off like some kind of giant blowhard but you know i have  been nominated yes for two mtv best kiss oh so you're talking to a very serious i mean i don't want to  threaten you or make you insecure and and the angie one wasn't even one of them really all right you  would get all right who was it all right winona rider made the cut okay all right uh and julie 
[01:59:30]  delpy made the cut wow man you know and so i just feel like you're not treating me with the proper  respect about kissing that we should be talking about yes you start bringing up porn stars you start  bringing out your groin yeah i mean i'm not i'm feeling very uncomfortable right now i don't i don't  have a lot of experience that was all i had that was really like this is kind of you know all joking  aside my first kiss of my life was on film wow wow that's i was uh emmanuel lewis 
[02:00:00]  gary glitter  so it's david lee roth um no i was uh it was i did a movie when i was 14 called the explorers  and in it there's a fantasy sequence where i kiss a girl a dream sequence and i actually had never  kissed a girl and so i had to do it for the first time on screen so for me my whole life has been  totally wow wow yes whatever happened to that girl um she's the intern jackie 
[02:00:30]  so what are you doing you're going to make out on film you got to make sure your breath is fresh  you know i mean that's just there's a lot to worry about i mean i had to do it a couple of takes  of it but it's fucking panic inducing i find it panic inducing i really do  yeah because it's like am i gonna is she gonna be gross is she just faking that she's enjoying  this yes yes she is  don't be confused about that let me ask ethan and maybe ask her for ethan answer for ethan it's not 
[02:01:00]  when you're filming it uh whatever it's the rehearsal where you're not sure like are we  going to make it on rehearsal yeah right when is the right time to really go for it yeah we'll  maul you i said that like and then oh here's the part where we're going to be kissing during the  stop and then when you go you go live uh so in rehearsals it's super weird especially closer  super weird right when they're they've already camera blocked they get the marks down like let's  do one more right before we get of sounds strange in in the theater because in the theater you do a  long run of a play you start to have to do it every night and what do you do with the same should 
[02:01:30]  you just shake it up i mean is that weird i mean you know you know shake it up that is  wow put her in a guillotine choke her out let those housewives from jersey get their money's worth  jesus man i walk into this morning i was asleep half an hour ago and now we're talking  uh well it's gonna get weirder in about a minute david lee roth's walking down the hall oh yeah can i  tell you my favorite david lee roth quote yes my favorite is i remember really the the first time i  remember watching mtv i was at a friend of mine's house and we turned it on there was david lee roth 
[02:02:00]  going they said how did you get into rock and roll and he said well because love making even at its  best only lasts eight or nine hours i had not kissed the girl at this point i was like wow wow david roth is  my hero he one of the most quotable rock stars ever absolutely just for years should we bring him in  for a minute come out even only has like one or two minutes yeah have him sit here i'll sit on the  couch you're a very busy man david lee in fast governor's night tomorrow and don't forget of 
[02:02:30]  course uh the purge opening this friday uh with ethan hogg it looks great man it looks like a uh  action-packed i like those i like those dlr david lee roth david lee roth  he just had one of your quotes uh david lee roth people sleep he was just quoting you what were you 
[02:03:00]  quoting uh you were asked how you got into rock and roll and um and you said because uh  lovemaking even at its best only lasts eight or nine hours you gotta be so careful what you play to  kids i like how he dave laughs at dave quotes that's a life of learning uh the lines and making it look 
[02:03:30]  like you didn't learn lines wow that's it that is true you know well you got to think large how's  everybody been good all right david okay i'm hanging out in the middle of a thought i was just amusing  about how great you were okay let's talk about cronuts what oh god the goddamn cron have you heard  about the phone what tell me i don't know there's like uh this guy he's got a truck he sells these  things called cronuts they're half it's not out of a truck though and half donuts and how much 
[02:04:00]  they cost and he's mutating them but you got to get online at 5 30 in the morning he only makes 200  a day and they and they and they sell them all out and then that's it he doesn't make line of people  okay so the question is is it the flavor or is it the price that's uh exactly everybody going it's  this hype thing that's going on well there's a big thing going on in tokyo i've been living there  for last year and haagen-dazs sent up right and uh everybody would line up for four hours to get  in to eat the ice cream yeah and then when they tried to put it in the marketplace and so forth it didn't 
[02:04:30]  sell anything nothing at all turns out people just want to be seen in the place eating haagen-dazs  that was the whole price or they want something that no nobody else can get yeah that's kind of  what people want to do it's conspicuous consumption like how many neck how many rings on your neck  can you wear in zimbabwe or whatever where is that is that here in town yeah yeah i think they do that  erock's freaking out because ethan i guess they're telling well listen it's a great pleasure to meet you  likewise you're the best let's promote ethan's film properly it's called the purge you know it

[02:08:30]  trying to touch their toes you can hear the the the belts popping pop pop  like this i would come out after a show yeah and you would invariably see uh there would be a pickup  truck festooned with beer cans every single space that you could get a vertical empty beer can on in  fact vertical empty beer can that sounds like a bandit coachella doesn't and uh they would have  it covered and somebody would get on the bumper there'd be three gals three guys and they'd launch  themselves off the toe was that you jay did you ever try that all the time jump off the bumper you know 
[02:09:00]  and try and touch their toes and so we go no that's not how you do it and clear off the hood you  know and you hear the beer cans and he climb up and launch and land in a heap much to the glee  you know of the uh derision and ridicule of the crowd and somebody would do it from the top  yeah until somebody snapped the leg probably they've told the best story on my podcast about van  halen trying to expand their parameter expand the parameters he said like when you're a kid you  you have bunk beds you remember this whole thing you said oh sure it was a mate we go ahead do it 
[02:09:30]  and i'll help you along let's see what you remember from it when you're a kid you have bench uh bunk  beds you put them a little farther apart and you go hey uh let's see if we can make it this far apart  from this bunk bed to that bunk bed uh-huh and then the whole band's like oh you know what put the  bunk bed against the wall i'm eddie i can do it better than dave i can do better than alex and my  put all the way across the wall the ground is lava if you touch the lava you're out hot lava you call  it yes yes you have two bunk beds people say dave why i'm in the middle of a really good story 
[02:10:00]  jesus christ what an ingrate  i tried to get you to tell it i never got tired of doing that you have two bunk beds my sister slept  in one hours or the other and you would jump across one to the other and go hot lava hot lava and you  didn't want to fall in but well you start off with a foot in between and then of course they try  and up the ante put it two feet apart sure you go hot lava and my career has been kind of the same  based on that ever since the beginning you know farther and farther apart how far away can we move 
[02:10:30]  and still uh survive how what can we do musically that's going to push the advantage a little bit  more what can we try on stage you know what can we do on the album cover this time that's farther  and farther inevitably you're going to fall into the hot to the hot lava yeah yeah and that's your  best drinking story the record company comes in like with you know for we got ideas for this album  you guys could maybe take it in this direction and dave was like no you don't understand we've already  had the beds we put one outside and we jumped from the second store window so uh move synthesizer 
[02:11:00]  what the fuck are you talking about we're already up to uh out the window off the wall against the  board uh it'd be really great if you guys could do a little more melody hooks that'd be great  we ran into that routinely you know it's like in the doors movie where the guy goes herman's  hermits let me just say two words herman's hermits that's music oh wow yeah yeah a lot of people try  to influence what you do um musically i'm sure over the years well it's vicarious it's vicarious you 
[02:11:30]  know when you say uh party like a rock star who do you think they're talking to you know you're talking  when you when a girl says me like a rock star who do you think she's talking about  not michael anthony well you could ask just about anybody in showbiz and otherwise and politics would  you like to be diamond dave 1985 august go and they'll answer yeah of course yeah yeah are you  kidding i just said when dave was uh sitting here party like a rock star and all this i realized just 
[02:12:00]  this moment there are no bands that sound like van halen there never has been  a band like when you listen to oasis they sound like the beatles when you listen to the black crows  they sound a little like zeppelin there's never been a band where you go that's kind  of a van halen who came uh close you think to sound like van halen well there's a variety of  bands who had old school roots we're a 70s band we enjoyed our success in the 80s but uh if you look  back in the stones okay and the zeppelins etc that's a combination of different neighborhoods you  follow there's some downtown there's some jazz there's some latino mixed in there and that's what 
[02:12:30]  made up van halen there's no magic to it at all we had to play a lot of different neighborhoods  you had to play a biker neighborhood that's born to be wild you're going to play south of the harbor  freeway that's going to be santana change your evil ways you know and and and surf well they  wanted aerosmith and you mix all of that learn to work everything in the kitchen and no matter what  you want kid pick a noodle choose a sauce we're good yeah they learned like a hundred that's a way  of describing things yeah oh he learned they had to learn like a hundred no i know covers just to go 
[02:13:00]  up i know he told us last time yeah i wasn't here that time and you flipped  the page so what kind of music is it i don't know i mean you know i wrote a few half of every song  and i'm not sure what what is jamie's crime what's dance the night away what is jump these are like  hybrid you know yeah but when you look under the hood you go wow italian viscous coupling and but  these uh tires they're uh kind of faintly from uh we're another country and you know you mix and match  all that that's what made all your favorite bands have you heard a band that has come close to 
[02:13:30]  sound like you like you'll hear like you jace that you hear bands that sound like no i know  but that's what i know why am i yelling at you i don't know i'm paraphrasing you and quoting you  and giving you full credit for it everyone around you you know you're not dude okay we come from we  came from theory and orchestration we went to professional music schools we did and then we  took a left and kept on going you know we completely downtown so they got a balance there between the  because uh eddie had quite a unique guitar sound and you obviously vocally had a very unique 
[02:14:00]  vocal style so you to to get that to happen again somewhere else well you have to play the 5 45  minute sets a night you know i don't know where those clubs are i know where there's occasional jam  night you know i know where there's a great comedy club tonight david's uh levittown  governor i'm gonna be so you play the big rooms i like to cobble them together 200 at a time  let me ask you a question though can you do what you do like in in a madison square garden we've seen  comics humor folks humorists go into giant arenas i want to ask you as professionals can you really 
[02:14:30]  pull that off jimmy and i absolutely yeah but for me like the whole 17 000 person thing would irritate  me so i'd prefer to do it with about 180 200 people which is my normal fucking sales yeah just to kind  of scatter them around the arena let them enjoy the space can you play jazz in a giant place i don't  think so no there's too many levels there's too many yeah i think what for what uh what we do if  the best part even for my kind of rock and roll with the uh with the brothers is where you can see 
[02:15:00]  eyebrows and faces once you can't see eyebrows anymore you get it starts to get impersonal just  draw the line right there where you aren't seeing fucking people  i can't believe david lee roth agreed to open for me at west hampton performing arts center uh  sunday uh that's really that's just incredible wow what we're gonna do i'm actually gonna  if you call up and name david lee roth's first record he ever bought because i know the answer  oh you got a good memory for that right well it's not every day david lee roth's in your 
[02:15:30]  fucking garage  i'm singing it all right or you can sing it  go ahead i'll beat the background music for the next few yeah did you see the phil  do you see the phil spector movie i did in fact how great was that oh it was uh kind of frightening  because that's a that's a temptation that's a place uh that in the last scenes of there will be  blood with daniel day lewis kind of takes place in the same kind of house and i have one of those 
[02:16:00]  checkerboard hallways it's hard to tell if that's a stairway to heaven or a stairway to somewhere  really really fun i like the liverache movie so much i'm like no jokes oh yeah behind the  candelabra hbo at this point needs like their own academy awards like this is really good  ridiculous that was really good every show they have like game of thrones and girls and uh the  spectrum are you happy i failed if you're not happy you know what everybody has been talking  i just everybody's been talking about the that particular show everybody has mentioned yeah 
[02:16:30]  game of thrones no no i love game of thrones i love game of thrones what would you know  no i'm talking about the liberace show everybody's mentioning that i love you  yeah see guys is there not an academy awards for like uh what is like an ace awards cable ace  yeah well the stuff is smarter you know the best comedy you can turn the sound off and you can't  tell if it's drama or comedy yeah you follow and you'll start to see that on the hbo's and the 
[02:17:00]  show times and stuff so maybe a lot of times the stuff is a little more dave was with tibetan mox uh  tibetan mox tibetan mox tibetan mox tibetan mox tibetan mox tibetan mox tibetan mox tibetan mox  and he's asking him questions about comedy like he's he's a fan i told him i  with these chinese i was sitting with 12 buddhist monks the real deal they got the shaved heads and  the robes and everything i said gentlemen i don't think there's any laughter in heaven  and you could hear a pin drop you know right and i was waiting you know and just in case you know they 
[02:17:30]  got upset i was gonna say you know like jewish heaven but uh that's like shakespeare or something  isn't it there's no laughter until things go completely really really really wrong and then  you gotta laugh yeah yeah you know that's i agree yeah you know but you don't see but you're right  to a certain degree it's like a lot of very uh religious people you don't see like monks laughing  like why wouldn't you guys have a ball once in a while like i've never seen keanu reeves laugh  is he is he a monk uh might as well be as much as he actually speaks he might as well be are you 
[02:18:00]  talking speaks in public or speaks in his flicks both now he's just doing these independent movies  where he walks around in his greasy hair well you know made some folks maintain that the best acting  like when how many how many syllables does stallone use in his traditional flick i've seen the  expendables you know five times he's the only english speaking in japan he goes that's enough  for me bill murray lost in translation didn't say a damn word you looked at the camera you saw how sad 
[02:18:30]  he was he was great i'm not kidding i say with uh some mirth but uh the best acting is the least  amount of knees and elbows and syllables now you're paying attention to that guy right yeah somebody like  eastwood you're terrified by that you'll better do that well that's still stallone but get out of my  lawn you pan face that's the best that's all monosyllables and you become if there's no flowery  there's no delivery system it's just right there you didn't see the liberagi movie yet no i have 
[02:19:00]  it i'll give it an a plus i think that uh he should win something for it matt damon was amazing is there  any room for improvement in that movie no i mean uh the acting was tremendous uh i would prefer a  little more the ass who saw matt damon coming we knew he was good actor he was happening and stuff  he was doing with affleck and look at the two of them now boom yeah the roles they're doing and the  producing the directing and yeah yeah i can't wait to the stuff for me i love that it's a big f you and 
[02:19:30]  thumbing your nose at hollywood because when they won their oscar for like uh goodwill hunting or  whatever it was uh yeah goodwill hunting screen where everybody's like well there's a sign of  the apocalypse these two guys won an oscar like turns out they're fucking great hollywood yeah  like he's such a good director and matt damon's great are there is there finally academy award for  production for producer yet oh no there's your answer that's your money guy well it's the money guy but  he's going to oversee you know variety i just i just made a four minute gangster flick it's on the uh 
[02:20:00]  internet there i did it with an all japanese cast and crew we call it a spaghetti eastern  let's watch it it's uh you can find it on itunes you know the roth uh you can find it a roth clip  roth film clip etc and it's called the roth cast too you got a great podcast so we uh shot that i  started off with just a single storyline so white guy walks into a i don't know where in japan there's 
[02:20:30]  three uh gangsters talking japanese they don't know he does they're saying ugly things to him he  turns and i use a single line from the uh a kid's cartoon sailor moon that little girls dug in the  80s and i use it as the death shit you know i say in the name of the sun and the moon stars i christ  you now or i strike you now and i shoot everybody in the room i see i hired 40 cast and crew and uh folks  from uh all uh lighting film camera set design they work on all the movies there and i said you 
[02:21:00]  fill in the rest and it's a spaghetti easter oh yeah and we spent six months we spent six months doing  it and they're the ones who said okay you gotta have an old lady sitting over here and when that  happens this music happens and then you have the blood spatter of the title well we gotta see it so  forth what's the name of it it's on our facebook page right now open and yeah and uh can we find it on uh  the the inner tubes what's it called why don't we all look at msnbc at the same time to find out  what day's movie was the whole room went is that morning joe is that you could somebody dig it up 
[02:21:30]  and then we'll just say the uh the address well he's coming in to get it for you okay okay but  at least see your line that's what a producer does that's you know is you got to keep everybody moving  north and motivating all the ideas so that when somebody says oh what if you have this kind of music  here or what if you put that a horse in the background there that's what a producer is going to yay or  nay uh after the director does and there's some great producers out there without whom we wouldn't  have great movies yo brockheim since some brockheimer team was great who did i sit behind once at a 
[02:22:00]  premiere uh erwin winkler um who i think oh yeah you know yeah i guess producers don't get enough of  the credit in the public but they certainly do in hollywood though like who put the team together  you know a lot of guys where would the ball teams be if somebody wasn't there you know collecting  everybody and uh you know putting them together have you found it you know where we are oh there  you go to ron to story yeah you know can i see please you're not home watching it's um  don't mind the pain on my list make it bigger you rock please what is it your fucking ipad 
[02:22:30]  i like the music  this is kineski he's the most famous uh sumo wrestler ever nothing's better on radio than video  yes but that sounded that is very spaghetti western that's a very spaghetti western sound  and i just and i come walking into where everybody convenes this is uh kind of like the 10th street  baths this is where everybody plays their cards is where all the gangsters hang out and like the  russians in uh whatever is the place you go to actually or no dave's a regular he's a regular there 
[02:23:00]  the lady knows you're here earlier she's in a million she's in a million earlier than usual right  you know i had no idea what i look like if you're looking badass yes everybody who thinks they can  act i thought let me like let's actually see what it looks like on film here without me actually  smiling once and without being the diamond dave i know are these guys well-known actors in japan  that's the most famous sumo wrestler oh yeah i've seen that guy before yes i've seen that guy  oh you can google him yeah yeah he's a friend from tokyo i keep waiting for dave to look at the camera 
[02:23:30]  somebody posted humala babel is evil and uh you know i know there's talking you i did my uh  four minute uh gangster flick piece of cake right yep wow these guys are really talking you can tell from  all the ink and everything and you can see that this is full of clues like the full moon is registered  behind my head and it's there's a tattoo on it it's the first scene of a movie we wrote and uh the 
[02:24:00]  character that's in a fuck off in japanese right i speak japanese and i play uh or i'm reading it an  assassin my character's name is brother teresa oh that's interesting yeah and uh the gangsta's name  big kurashiki his name is peach and this is just the first scene i could only afford the first four minutes  so it looks great looks amazing this is kind of like if you you want this to be made into a full film  this is like what billy bob did with the sling blade right make it into a short uh everybody who shot 
[02:24:30]  this works on all the movies all around asia they shoot all the red bull and the coffee ads and  everything yeah most of these guys worked on lost in translation and they've never had somebody  actually set up a framework and say go right artist to artist this doesn't have to sell anything  it doesn't have to attract any subscribers it doesn't have to please any sensors just as a  team all 40 of us create this using this framework and i'll sponsor it i'll produce and pay for it but  it's uh it's well shot you're the coolest guy took us about six months to pull this together 
[02:25:00]  here you should like start a band or something you're just a cool like you know what's the word  front man you're like a front man yeah and this is international now it's just getting attention  all over drinking milk out of the carton obviously he's a gangster oh that's a tradition that strawberry  drink is it kind of a drink that's been drinking over there since the early 50s you follow there's  got that and now it's unexpected diamond dave and uh the quote i'm about to give comes from a 
[02:25:30]  little kids cartoon it's the same as quoting popeye before you pull the trigger which they found  horrifying and delightful in japan yeah so you know if you're drinking it and uh that's my audition  reel we're launching my film career here today that is you know what it's great i'm not seeing  anything where i'm taken out of this this is like it's a real film you know i'm totally intolerant  i'm gonna help and i say it with the perfect accent 
[02:26:00]  you have the obvious ending without hearing the gunshots right and there the bodies are left in a  red wipe and then the walk-off with japanese credits that nobody can read exactly that says  is that a real tattoo yeah i got that finished when uh well we're not quite finished but uh  that's the real deal wow you got that on your back right now i got about 150 hours in there of the 
[02:26:30]  real deal with the hand poking and everything this entire back yeah that is amazing holy  shit oh my god that is amazing work hey that's amazing jesus christ wow and you had all that done  in japan yeah and that's not riboside wow i know a guy that's pretty goddamn coal man diamond dave  in the house with the flip phone i like that prepaid i used it as uh holy shit like campfire you know 
[02:27:00]  when you get around and to pass the news of the day try out my language lesson that day i went to school  two hours a day for language and you know here's my latest stuff and you know what are you seeing  on the tube and you know planning and stuff so it's not just getting the ink right it's a thousand  year old uh newspaper so what's up today you know hey every every experience you can have over there  i guess educates you to everything the culture the language yeah you bet yeah yeah you don't have 
[02:27:30]  any other tattoos just one giant piece on your back yeah pretty much wow so pretty awesome yeah i like  the way that was fucking shot man it reminded me certain moments like like the way john wu shoot  you ever watch john wu stuff of course and i love that type of uh that's like a really uh an asian  way of shooting for some reason they don't shoot that way in america and i love the way that stuff  is done like i was the only uh this is the follow-up to dave's movie it's a chinese circus a bear and a  monkey on bikes the bear eats the monkey jay it's not very nice no no no but uh it's a film crew that 
[02:28:00]  i was i was the only outsider gaijin face that was on there and uh you know good time to motivate  people they had never had somebody say if you got a good idea i'll pay for it that's what a producer  does and everybody's all the music goes here but not that kind of instrument and then don't hear the  gunshots that's not traditional skip the gunshots and show the drip now oh okay all right and uh  just made sense to me and i was just kind of wander from department to department going how about a 
[02:28:30]  little more of that oh that was good can you turn that up louder and how cool dave has an apartment  in japan like it's where he lives most of the time yeah yeah you're the coolest guy i just finished  a year overseas and i'm dying uh i'm gonna i'm done and i'm back uh here for american culture you know  pizza pizza comedy seller and strip tease are you guys going back on the road or are you just  hanging now uh in about three days i'm meeting the fellas in nagoya and we're doing the japan tour  we got about 40 000 friends and just said you came back from there yesterday afternoon 
[02:29:00]  yeah now you're going back sure yeah well come on for most folks a 10 or 12 hour airplane flight  that's a little unforgiving we do 10 and 12 hour bus rides every night out on the road you follow  and people say but you can walk around nobody walks on a bus you get out of the bunk you fight  your way like das boot up to where you always say you know wait for the burrito to microwave and  change channel change the cable and that's all you do so you know flying uh you know on a 12-hour 
[02:29:30]  flight to japan frankly the food's a little better on the airplane yeah and i'm sure you know you got  the lay down seat which band is this you're going out with van halen we're playing on new oh van halen  yeah it's yeah part of them jay up and coming guys and uh there you go we're doing uh tokyo osaka  and nagoya we put this off ed was ill last season so this is the delayed routine that was wolfgang on  base yep that is and they uh michael anthony though huh uh don't don't go there okay sorry and people 
[02:30:00]  people know you i wasn't you know i'm not asking you to throw i apologize i don't know wolf plays  plays a great place and he's got a great voice that's really coming along strong as far as my old  team you're always going to have the the original is going to be best that's who i got 10 000 hours  with you know the 10 000 hour rule none of us were really that good until we passed that 10 000 hour  moment even bobby fisher as a chess prodigy had to do his 10 before he was able to really bring it to 
[02:30:30]  the russians but at least he ended his life with dignity how did he die bobby he died i think of  cancer but you know and i love he's one of my favorite people ever really crazy he was just such  a psychotic anti-semite but he was a jew he was a full-blood jewish guy's mother father and just you  well you know he 9 11 the fucking jews like he was like that angry you hear the phone call he made on  9 11. he started to sound like homeless or whatever yeah but that type of genius comes with a price and  that's what it was he was so brilliant you'll never have to worry about that do you play chess is 
[02:31:00]  it's all i took chess lessons from probably half a dozen different teachers and you know what i don't  use i don't play a good game of chess but i use it in real in real life constantly i think ten moves  ahead i had a great teacher mr gufeld from uh he was the soviet socialist republic coach from all of  the 70s and edward gufeld and he would say chess is gymnastic for brain and he would anyway and he  taught with his forearm if i made a mistake bam he'd knock all the pieces off he'd go okay mr genius 
[02:31:30]  now we try a memory to perfect again and wow wow an asshole well actually all right now wait i'm  going to someone translate this a little different anybody who cares enough to get that excited around  me i'm interested in because we make a living around people who are so blasé and full of savvy  and our agents and managers who've seen it all and that's a good idea guys and whatever somebody  gets excited enough to go no oh i'm interested in that kind of energy especially if it's channeled 
[02:32:00]  my way when he's playing the russians some kid was just tapping his uh chess piece drove him nuts  on the side of the board but it took him two days to realize he was playing out of his speed  he was he sped up the kids sped him up just he just had a really holding a pawn and as he was thinking  he would just go like this and then bobby fisher like was getting his teeth kicked in and i think  it wound up in a draw because he once he figured it out wow it out but like the mind games those 
[02:32:30]  guys play are otherwise in russia if you won you got to go spend two weeks in cuba and that's where  he would train okay during the summer if you lost you went the other way siberia or this kind of  those guys of cheating too he said that the russians would manipulate and lose games to each other to  position certain guys to play certain guy like you know he and he probably wasn't bicycle racing yeah  that happens in nascar too it's like in bicycle racing don't they decide uh you know okay we're 
[02:33:00]  gonna the guys who aren't the number one runner will move the way until so and so can lunge forward  or so yeah yeah yeah they use a team mentality for national pride because for the soviets it was the  important thing for the russians to win not for for kasparov or for no individuals yeah  it's for the are we surprised is there any sport that doesn't have cheating in it is there any sport  that doesn't have steroids and uh blood doping and yeah really i like the cheating i like the  steroids you're not cheating you're not trying well also you know i like it right i'd like to position 
[02:33:30]  a thought here that if you're gonna get involved as long as the other guys using steroids i don't  care it brings it all up to you know relative it's all relative when you were a kid playing  wiffle ball in the driveway every once in a while you put a little pebble in the wiffle ball  you really get to throw that knuckleball once because the guy fouls it off the ball the the  little pebble flies out you're like whoa i don't even know if i can throw that one again that was  weird baseball is nothing but cheating the curveball yeah stealing home you know it's like it's all 
[02:34:00]  larceny yeah that's right i mean there's a play in baseball called stealing yeah somebody  somebody wrote once that uh the first time monkeys it really exhibited human-like intelligence is  when one lied to the other and tricked them for the first time really oh that was the big break  point in human intellect monkeys developed from that point the first time a monkey lied to the  other they saw them intentionally they said okay now we can see humans happening this can happen i  know it was a couple and the and the and the male monkey slid back and he pulled the condom off and 
[02:34:30]  then put his dick back in she had no idea you said no honey that is your impression on the pillow  and then the female monkey said it's your monkey  and it's monkey time  first record you ever bought monkey time right  can we play that iraq we got that guy uh tweet me after he listened to you on my podcast  monkey time he went to baskin robbins with his kids like minutes after finishing the podcast and 
[02:35:00]  that was playing yeah and he said he wanted to look at everybody  there's a place right across town  this has roots you'll hear bruce springsteen in the song if you hear uh if you played a song you'll go  oh springsteen has his feet both planted in that kind of music  kiddin there's a place right across town wherever you wait  i can keep going  keep going  like 
[02:35:30]  this is  like you know you remember that i've never heard that once you play it you'll kind of hear  a little bit of what's the monkey time major lance of monkey time  major like it's 1960s new york city style rock you know it's east coast and it's got the you know  it's got uh like the glock in the background that bing bing bing bing well he looks for it look  here we go turn it up turn it up turn it up 
[02:36:00]  found it springsteen sure  yeah little horns  oh sandy  the fireworks are hailing over little eden tonight  gather round  it's that feel good east coast stuff  i like it 
[02:36:30]  i'm not saying a word it's too cool  i don't know how it started you gotta that's where you sing to each other on the dance floor  you know  was this remade by anybody  well i don't see what's happening is it sounds like a lot of songs you've just heard right and 
[02:37:00]  that's why i say bruce because i grew up around it too and it's in the music it's like curry  downtown it's in everything right right and uh you can you hear that it's happy and it's good  dancing yeah yeah it's got brass first record he ever bought  fun monkey time there's another version in here all right let me hear that version  shut up leave my life what are you doing  you want to put something else on i want to hear you guys like chumbawamba  i'll take full responsibility here's happy birthday somebody with a syllable name kajagugu 
[02:37:30]  too shy shy 100 haircuts haircut 100 he also had another song that was uh when you know you've  seen songs see where you got 12 year old guys you know walking down their tracks singing you know  purple pink bikini uh polka dot bikini and stuff these songs were to me that way you would learn  where the part is you sing to each other and so forth and uh major lance 1961 that was the first  single that i got i had to rake the lawn for uh almost five days in a row and uh that's how i earned 
[02:38:00]  the cash for it and i went and bought it by the single it was a dollar five forty five  listen to it more than once in a row i listened to it seven thousand times in a row and now if  somebody says to me dave can you give me any advice as a new young artist musician painter drama  absolutely at any given time have a song that you're listening to over and over again like 30  times a day but just something like this that's feel good whatever and you'll get tired of it in  three weeks replace it with another song when you get to my age you put that song on you go right 
[02:38:30]  back oh man this is when i was on opian anthony this is when i was there and i was wearing that  t-shirt you know and like that that was my favorite t-shirt where did that go bring you right  and you will go right back and i have dozens and dozens and dozens of songs like that and i just i  carry the song the one it's in the deck down below doesn't have to be any kind of certain so it can be  pop can be dance groove country blues doesn't old new and just listen to that one song over and over 
[02:39:00]  and you put it in you go oh oh that was the summer in tokyo oh  and you go right back no movie no book no play can take you like that you follow yeah there is  music can do when you hear a song sometimes there's a visceral feeling yeah not only a memory it's like  you get a weird feeling like like you're reliving when you were there completely reliving that and if  you're doing it during the summer like the summer coming up like i dig the humidity and oh yeah you  know and you can feel their skin starts to do like that you know it's like when somebody goes 
[02:39:30]  how about some pizza and your mouth starts to water it's just that whatever that response is kicks in  and uh when i hear that song major lance i know exactly oh oh that skateboard we built  yeah we had to make it out of a roller skate you had to saw a roller skate in half and use the clay  wheels and you had to use two halves of the roller skate on a piece of four by four and that's what major  lance is to him that's uh marty mcfly can i ask you a van halen question sure i'm uh of course my 
[02:40:00]  favorite band uh when you guys do like intruder and do uh any instrumental like that it just it seems  incongruous to the whole album like when you have just these monster songs monster songs monster songs  and then it's only like a minute and a half of just an instrumental i think the casual fan goes  why why'd they stick that in there it's weird is that is it music that just there aren't words to  yet and you go well fuck it we're not even trying doing the words apparently it's an instrumental 
[02:40:30]  and it must go on diver down it's too good to leave out a lot of it is comes from the club days  it's a good point a lot of it comes from the club days when we would have to play five 45 minute sets  we learn how about that from reading about the beatles and the stones and every good uh  rock band whoever so you learn to stretch oh yeah exactly we understand that the first solo would  be just like the record the second solo would be an eddie solo and then you would have to have intros  to do a lot like what we do here you know hey don't forget we're going to be here tomorrow night 
[02:41:00]  if you had a great time tell a friend if you've had a shitty time tell an enemy because we're still  going to be back here tomorrow and the ladies dance contest on wednesday don't forget that and i'd be  doing my my stuff and you need to have something going on you know set up a group out hit a group  and the guys would play along and uh it becomes it starts to become actually part of the music it's  not just an add-on you follow and we got so used to doing that for well you know like the middle part  of you really got me you know you're making the noises and carrying on and intruders certainly but 
[02:41:30]  like cathedral is like a completely different sound entirely it's almost radio head ish before it's time  well we had a mix and match uh taste in music we weren't just one neighborhood i call it heavy  metal is one neighborhood uh you know we were thunder funk we were also playing songs like uh  cool in the gang and get down tonight and stuff in the beer bars and learn how to work the vocals  because we didn't have keyboards and so forth so you would mix zz top with uh you know ohio players 
[02:42:00]  in the same set you know and have to go from one song to the other without giving a break because you  you don't want to clear the dance floor and piss off the guy at the bar because then his beer sales  dwindle not not to be a dog with a chew toy here but are there songs with lyrics that are on the  cutting room floor that you go well maybe we should have put that instead of cathedral uh most of those  songs are on this most recent album different kind of truth we have a a group of tunes that uh didn't 
[02:42:30]  get quite fleshed out and especially lyrical i'll be the first one to say it's your fault dave it is  my fault slowing everything down well you know when you first start off like anything else it's all  devil's in fire and you know let's sleep with another game let's sleep with two now yeah hey let's  split get those bunk beds apart how about three hot lava yes and then and then you start to figure 
[02:43:00]  out the six or eight bad habits you're really good at and then you focus lyrically you mature you're  the best well done sir yeah he's like a good bottle of scotch you know i i like it to be at  least 18 it's fine if it looks 12 i don't care it's got to be 18 or more we gotta take a break  because we got a lot of uh live reads today david lee ron you're sticking around right sure all right  good yeah and we've just been informed did we say it on the air doc gooden's coming in today at like

[02:48:30]  or just a little bit of everything in there it's the good memories the bad memories the not so good  memories what was going on in my head during the times of the good memories and the bad memories  yeah yeah you start the book with a chilling it's like really sad and frustrating story about the  the uh world series uh the parade and in the uh uh when you missed that it's fucking heartbreaking  through i kept even though i knew how it ended i kept hoping like just go just go you're watching  this frustrating drug addicted yeah but nevertheless somebody once said if somebody made a movie of 
[02:49:00]  your life would a lot of people go to see it and it sounds like a lot of people would and that's  a success story that's that story that i love it i'm still allowed to tell the story is amazing  hello right right which is uh yiddish for yo come on definitely because like you mentioned uh missing  the parade that night was like supposed to be the happiest day of my baseball career uh-huh  turned out to be the saddest day of my baseball career you know you end up in a project you're  doing drugs and drinking with strangers you don't even know and you know you're watching the parade on tv 
[02:49:30]  that was me that was you that was me and the thing about it you don't get to redo that right  right that's that's a one-off man if you miss it that's a big one but talking about the people  that you were getting high with and how like you know you start off the night loving these people  and it's fun and it's camaraderie and then by the end of the night you just like i want to just  get the fuck out of here the sun is coming like knowing that you're about to miss it and it happens  anyway oh it's just a i mean the worst experience you could ever imagine in your life because like 
[02:50:00]  you said the idea was to go there do a little bit and get out of there and go finish you know  celebrating with my teammates obviously i got there and it never ends that way not for me anyway with  uh cocaine normally when i go on bench with that it's a three-day thing and that's just the way it  is and cocaine's a tricky drug wow oh in my rock band getting loaded wasn't like an episode thing it  was a seasonal thing it's like first okay it's summertime let's get loaded right oh yeah it's  definitely it's tuesday let's get loaded yeah right no no i mean all summer all the whole summer 
[02:50:30]  all summer yes were you a drug guy david lee roth no i'm a beer and pot that's what i thought  i'm an outdoor kind of you know i got lucky my bad habits are more like two chicks in a toaster oven  that's uh please continue i stayed away from the white stuff huh oh no i did everything i  sampled everything i tried everything but i just snuck out from under it because i had  i was going to also be a samurai warrior you know and i had to be in the gym but that's the only reason  i didn't have any self-control for about 20 years were they were they piss testing back then in baseball 
[02:51:00]  because it's amazing that you were able to do all that coke and still and still play and not get  kicked out or well it's a situation where um normally they can't test you unless you've been  through a program or you tested positive before or got in trouble or something like that up until the  time where the mets decided to test me in the spring training in 1987 i hadn't been in any trouble for  it um there's a lot of um there's a there's a pattern that could have led to that that they could  have saw what was going on so actually the spring training 87 it got to the point where obviously 
[02:51:30]  you missed the parade after the 86 season getting to a scuff with the cops after the 86 season you get  the spring training you know showing up late they knew something went wrong and one day they called me in  and said we'd like to test you me not knowing the whole thing all i knew is i enjoyed doing cocaine  not knowing how long i stayed in the system not knowing that i had my rights that i could have  refused to test so i figured i hadn't done at the end of the day go ahead and test me and by doing  that it was a good thing and a bad thing um obviously the test came back positive at that point they  said we need to go to rehab and we'll continue to pay your salary or if you choose not to go to rehab 
[02:52:00]  we're going to suspend you without pay so even though i still was in denial didn't think i had a problem  i decided i'll go to rehab i'll mark count the days down you know 30 days till i'm done and i'll still get my  pay so obviously i went to the rehab to smithers was a great program but i didn't try to get  anything out of it because i still think i had a problem who even knew what rehab was in those  days that was something you sent uncle bob to when he was up to a court or whatever there people  still thought cocaine wasn't addictive that that was rockstar stuff to do and you a lot of times 
[02:52:30]  you'd sign up to go into showbiz so you could do that we decided we were going to break all the  records those included you know we're going to make elvis look like a beginner i was going to make  keith richards look like a freaking boy scout you know so these days the perspective on it is very  different the reality entered into the picture of course but it's totally different now and  obviously like you said you think it's not you know addictive or whatever but and then plus the  danger of it now you don't know what's in this stuff you're taking oh man yeah what was the first  sign because you said that uh you talked about when you missed the parade but before that the 
[02:53:00]  mets had been there had been rumors about your drug use and what was the first sign or what first  tipped them off to like who are you looking at jim i think what took them off was um you know  hanging out at different um party spots in the city where you know basically drugs are known to be  at and um hanging out at those places so obviously major league baseball called myself in and questioned  me as well as daryl about you know using drugs and of course you deny it sure no it's not me 
[02:53:30]  and of course daryl said no it's doc you know but uh that happens but uh you know at that time  obviously i was using and you know at that point i refused to be tested by major league baseball where  do you think this came from because uh you know anybody looking in from the outside you're at the top  of your game i mean you're you're a star uh world series i mean where do you think that came from  well uh i can tell you exactly where it came from it came from all the pressure all the expectations not  only from the media but then the expectations i sort of put on myself uh for example like 84 my 
[02:54:00]  rookie year when i came into the league at 19 years old really wasn't much expectations to after the  all-star break then especially right and then i have my career in 1985 so 86 everything i did was  compared to 85 for you know for example 86 was a good year yeah it was three it was three months  shorter than most years because it was up all night though yeah you got you so so now uh like if i 
[02:54:30]  if i won a game against say like fernando vanes for all or her shots if i won two nothing you know  complete game shutout but i only had four strikeouts the first question would be what happened you don't  have four strikeouts oh wow so the next start i'm going out trying to get 10 strikeouts trying to pitch  a complete game trying to pitch a shout out and just all expectations just trying to live up to that  and what i started doing is medicating myself you know with drugs and alcohol so you listen to the credit it's  it's athletes i know get like you know entertainers get critics and stuff and athletes get killed on  the back page that would affect you what they were saying about you oh 100 i think most players maybe 
[02:55:00]  it's a two percent maybe don't um affect but myself you know um obviously unfortunately being a people  pleaser as well i pay attention to the papers pay attention to what's being said and anything you see  it affected me because now i got to go out i got to do better and it took away the fun of the game  and you would uh it was nice to read too you talked about your father a lot and you and what an  influence he was and you were the first boy in the family so he became obsessed with just you and  baseball and uh you would call him after every game and kind of share that with him yeah definitely my 
[02:55:30]  dad is the one that really taught me the game i remember as a kid uh sitting there watching the  games on tv with him back then there wasn't all the um baseball networks you just got the game a week on  saturday they won't have a game on the radio whatever the team was you know local close by at that  time and uh watching games and he taught me the game so once i made it after every game we had this deal  where he had a big salad dish back then after the game was over before i even talked to the media  i'll call my dad you know we'll talk about baseball and go over the game what i could have done  differently even if i pitch out he'll find something that could have been done differently just kind of 
[02:56:00]  keep me humble would that bother you if he criticized it or would you actually look for his advice and  counsel on what you do raw i always look for it it didn't really bother me because we're just doing  it trying to even like say like during the 85 season he's just trying to give me something to work  on between starts where you don't just settle for having a good game did he know you were in trouble with uh  drugs at that point you know it's funny is uh like like i talked about a lot in the book where  in 87 i tested positive i had to come home and tell my parents that you know i gotta go to rehab um 
[02:56:30]  my mom she always knew something wasn't right i think my dad kind of looked the other way a little  bit and plus my dad you know he had his drinking problem as well so when i told him you know i  fell the drug test hey we'll rehab my mom basically said well that's great you can get the help you need  where my dad just kind of dropped his head oh wow and never said a word well he doesn't want the  spotlight at that point in time you know if he's got an issue then you know a little bit of your  spotlight of that issue would get towards him i had too many temptations it was it was started off as  jesus the longer i stay up the more we can girls we can sleep with and the more guys we can go jam 
[02:57:00]  blues with and then we can just stay up all the way until we're into the next city and uh we could do  that for three days in a row do you follow that's why we started drinking jack daniels that's a prep  but the press looks at a rock band a lot differently that's cool oh you're supported  you're supposed to do it it's completely different like dwight and is like like like what are you  doing yeah you're you're i don't think he could have been swigging jack daniel's right right 
[02:57:30]  in my department people get upset if you didn't party yeah actually i kind of like uh i'm going to  thinking about doing another marathon they go whoa whoa what happened to uh yeah yeah yeah five  in the morning dave the mess pr has its own pressure on you as well the mess pr wouldn't be thrilled  doc two girls get a picture out quick oh god it's you know rock stars and athletes i think have  different expectations yeah yeah totally different game but uh you also definitely have a lot of respect 
[02:58:00]  oh god you told a great story too in the book about your dad uh being uh shot  by uh or shot at by your uh your mom uh so you grew up in a very interesting house yeah it's very  interesting as a kid you know unfortunately and i'm sick it may sound but just thought those were  normal things that took place in every family yeah um well they kind of are depending on what point of  the map you're pointing at it's not so unusual a lot of neighborhoods that is common life and so 
[02:58:30]  forth you know please yeah so uh when that happened actually my dad was having an affair and  a lot of times he'll take me he'll tell my mom that i want to go get some cookies and juice or  whatever but what he would do is ask me you want to go to the store which any kid would say yes i  want to go to the store so i'll go to the store we get the cookies and juice and then we'll go to his  girlfriend's house her oldest daughter would come outside in the car and kind of babysit me while he's  in there taking care of his fitness and somehow my mom found out what was going on and there's one 
[02:59:00]  particular day she followed him to the house and oh wow when him and the woman's coming out  she actually you know shot it shot at him and the woman she actually hit him in the shoulder  and she always tell me the story where she was upset that she didn't get the woman as well wow  wow i mean i'm almost the sweetest lady but also she could be the toughest lady oh man woman scorned  we got a question from uh the guy in the corner  uh it's ironic to me like when you get high as an athlete i i don't think you guys are aware of the 
[02:59:30]  high you provide us on a daily basis i was at your no hitter at yankee stadium just a tuesday that's all  i remember what most about your no hitter it was it was just a tuesday and that's a no hitter it's the  craziest thing you could ever be a part of because the super bowl the world series the all-star game  you bring all your hype with you a no hitter it's fucking tuesday and your friend goes do you want  to come you're like all right you know what i'll go and then by the seventh inning you can't breathe 
[03:00:00]  and then you had you threw like 190 pitches in that game you walked eight it was the mariners  and it was like paul sorrento jay buter that memory huh ken ricky jr like the the last five guys you  faced it was like oh my god it's in the seventh inning is he going to come out for the eighth eighth  inning now he's got to come out for the ninth that was probably athletic uh viewing at second  place being larry johnson hitting the three in the garden against the pacers your no hitter was like 
[03:00:30]  that was the biggest high for me in the world it's so just ironic that as so many athletes fall into  the traps of drugs but i guess that's what we're all doing we're just chasing the dragon every time  we go to the stadium at the end of a game like that you feel as tired as the guy actually playing  yeah were you high on the air on the air on the mound no i was never i never used never used before  the game or during the game or anything yeah that's self-control right there but i was already  premeditated and after the game what about daryl did he use during the game after the game was um 
[03:01:00]  i was going to use either to celebrate or i was going to lose i mean use because i was pissed right  right right right there i'm not sure i'm not sure what he did is that the breakfast of champions that  you're eating uh yes uh thanks for pointing it out there davidly wrong trying to finally eat  breakfast multi-grain cheerios if you need to know in uh the bad guys won there's been a bunch of  mets books about that era and it seemed like and i'm not asking to air your guy out or throw your guy  under the bus under any situation you can only speak for yourself i know that but it it seemed like 
[03:01:30]  once the test started coming back there seemed to be this sort of like oh you got to talk to daryl or  daryl would say oh you got to talk to doc this sort of like uh running back and forth like it  wasn't me it was him it wasn't him it was me was that the media making that up or was it like i'm  going to get suspended i better well no not at all for me when anytime the rumors came around with me  they asked me or even out there when i failed my test in 87 the mets in major league baseball and 
[03:02:00]  there was who's you using what was your teammates you better tell us if you don't tell us this what's  going to happen and i just said well and then the truth was i was basically used by myself i mean  me and daryl used together occasionally like say in 86 but outside of one or two times that was it  you know obviously he's been public with his troubles i mean probably mine but we never really parted  together are you uh are you you sober now are things good now yeah two and a half years uh yeah  i like that let's do it thank you i got 32 days clean and sober not not in a row since january since 
[03:02:30]  january that's got to be weird to be at a meeting and uh and doc hood and sitting across from you  sharing i'm like i had a rough day my barbecue didn't fire up and you're like well when i won my  world series ring you're like wait a minute is this the three o'clock moorpark meeting well where are we  there is a three o'clock moorpark meeting i know that's right and a one o'clock it's amazing you  say that though but you know anytime i'm in the meetings you know that uh obviously everybody's in 
[03:03:00]  there from different walks of life yeah but we're all there for the same come and go that's right  and that's the main you know help each other stay clean and sober just for that day yeah it is  tomorrow do the same thing it is an amazing uh we'll just say a program that it really is when you  walk in nobody gives a shit we're all just trying to keep our lives together it's it's pretty cool  yeah yeah that's the main thing what's good about the book too is and listening to you talk we were  talking about when people write something in the book dave and i were talking about how they don't  want to talk about it on on the air and you're brutally honest it's great like that that really 
[03:03:30]  makes people want to read a book is like you're not coming in going well i don't know god you're like  just fucking this is everything that happened here it is and that's what i wish everybody would do when  they put out a book and they and they talk about their life it's brutally honest if i don't see  myself if i don't see myself reflected in your eyes i'm going to get out within 30 seconds of your  story you follow and the stuff that attracts me most to people's stories and people's backgrounds  are the flaws the cracks in the woodwork the fractures your favorite jeans are the ones that 
[03:04:00]  are most fucked up with the holes in the knees and the old boots that aren't polished and that's  the most interesting thing about each other as human beings as long as there's no hole in the back of  the jeans you know what that means but that's you mentioned that you know for me what kept me sick  for so long is like you know you're sick is your secrets and for a long time like you mentioned i  would tell half the story i wasn't comfortable telling the whole story it took a while for me to  admit that i have a disease it took a long time to admit that i'm an addict i'm alcoholic those words 
[03:04:30]  when i said i kind of stumbled over them because i was still in denial and to me it was like um that means  you're weak so i found it to a point that hey i'm dying thinking i'm i got this stuff on the  control because i mean i've been to prisons i've been in jails i've been to rehabs so the only  thing left for me is the cemetery if i choose to go back out there so it was just a time in my life  where i was just tired of living that lifestyle and when you surrender you have to surrender everything  because i was trying to hold on to the lifestyle without alcohol and drugs but it doesn't work that  way so i had to come clean and just get this is what happened like you say this is not who i am 
[03:05:00]  today but these things that i went through and i can go right back to that if i was to choose to pick up  or take that one drink and how long were you in jail for i mean we all remember when you went and  it's weird to see such an iconic figure go you're like oh my god that is what happens like when you  when you keep going oh it was a horrible time i mean i was in jail for well prison actually for  ten and a half months um it's tough to go to prison any time in your life but to go in at 40  for the first time was horrible especially when you have little kids you know and daughters 
[03:05:30]  especially where if something happens nothing you can do wow you only get a 15-minute phone call  per day and if you miss that time you know big bubble ain't gonna give up his time right you're  done that's just the way it is how did they treat you in jail i mean was it uh because you are who  you are was that good or bad it was uh a little bit of both when i first got there i think it was  a situation where they wanted to see how you was going to come in how it's going to be just based on  the name um right away they made it known that in here there's no names right right your number and  you're no different than the other guy you're gonna pick up the trash you're gonna do it when i tell you 
[03:06:00]  you're gonna shower when i tell you you're gonna wear we tell you where you're gonna clean up the  yard when we tell you you'll eat when we tell you and you're gonna eat what we tell you so it was a  whole big adjustment but um i just came in trying to be as humble as i can and just kept my distance  from everyone and as time went on you know we started to kind of i wouldn't say fit in is the  right word but you came to kind of adapt a little bit on certain days but certain days you thought  you're gonna lose your mind wow it's because you're coming from i mean if jail for anybody sucks but 
[03:06:30]  coming from a place of being you know like jay said the no hitter the world's all this great glory  to to come to this place you got to wonder like what what the was i thinking what happened yeah  what happened exactly exactly right and some days to be honest with you guys some days i'll wake up  and say oh this gotta be a dream i'm gonna wake up in my bed it's gotta be a dream they should say  how am i gonna make it not just you know 10 months but how am i gonna make it to the next day  how am i gonna make it you know uh like i mean you carry your food and sometimes you got some guys that  if they want your food they're gonna take it i mean you got 10 guys there's nothing you can do 
[03:07:00]  i mean there's a gentleman i saw i didn't literally see him get raped but you're just  like about five feet from the shower and you hear him screaming for his life and then oh man  so you wanted oh my god next you know you don't know is this a hard way of living did that guy look  anything like me the one who was being assaulted i imagine i'd be quite popular in that setting i'm  i'm certain of it it's a hard situation what was it i felt that way during accounting meetings you  know with my accountant you know when warner brothers signs a contract i i felt that way i 
[03:07:30]  wasn't you know two different worlds two different worlds great in that time period everybody every  athlete just got arrested in tampa like tampa was just where you went to get put in jail whether  every single athlete you just seem coming out of tampa jail well that makes perfect sense because  that's a port entry right that that miami is where you know all the way he says rape in the  shower you say port of entry i don't think he wants to hear that i don't this is freaking me out  now can you look back on on those great moments obviously as an athlete and not and be able to put 
[03:08:00]  away the the part that kind of taints that because it seems like it would be such a waste to have such  a great career great memories professionally but it's always got that that nagging drug problem  hanging over him you know that's a great question because i was going to ask it but no you weren't  all right no because what happened was so many times when i would relapse so many times by going  these binges it was because i was guilty depressed and upset because i was thinking what my career 
[03:08:30]  should have been what others thought my career should have been more more so than me thinking  that when you hear everybody say oh you should be in the hall of fame or you should win 300 games  i should beat myself up with that a lot of time and start believing that unfortunately when i was in  prison the only good thing i can say came out of that was even though i got in trouble in 2010 when  i came out of prison in 06 but when i was in prison when you got nothing but time i mean nothing but  time and you're not going anywhere i had a chance to really of my life replay the whole take the good  and bad and everything right place and i came across the thing i said you know what when i was a kid i 
[03:09:00]  remember telling my dad was watching the game i said my goal is to i want to make the major leagues i want to  stay healthy and play a long time i never thought about awards never thought about the hall of fame  never thought of going about you know winning 300 games royal series you don't think about that  things um i got to win every award possibly for a pitcher i had three royal series rings in new york  um i was through the no hitter yeah i mean so when i looked back on i said look i can't beat myself up 
[03:09:30]  over this stuff anymore because others expectations of me because when i was five years old nobody thought  this guy's gonna be a hall of fame pitcher he's gonna win 300 games i got to really live a  career that most players would dream of living so i had to eliminate that part because i found out  also in rehab that by me beating myself over that all i was doing was getting myself a reason to go  back out and use uh-huh so i had to eliminate all that and like you say start patting myself on the  bike for the career that i did yeah you could look i guess uh prison will give you a ton of put things  in perspective what did you do what did you use your time to do because something we started off 
[03:10:00]  talking about chess briefly there and i know a lot of the fellows who work at the chess clubs downtown if you  see a ton of forearm tattoos watch out because he's been playing chess constantly for his entire  stay some guys read a lot some folks get into the bible somebody what did you use your time doing  in my time once i was there and i kind of accepted that i'm going to be here for 10 and a half months  i got in this thing where um normally i was like that is um the track i used to walk the track a lot  i basically stayed to myself i didn't play any softball so occasionally i'll play i must have been pissed 
[03:10:30]  that you decided for softball that's the movie yeah you know what happened to them  man that's how to cause problems he's going to play against the guards right you know what happened  i had this guy kind of tell me when i was in a county jail before i got sent off to prison  kind of pre-warned me he goes when you get to prison stay by yourself because when you get there  they have sports they're going to already have you on a team oh yeah and if you're on that team the  other team's going to be pissed right and if you're on that team you're not doing well your team's 
[03:11:00]  gonna be pissed and you don't want that and it's probably gonna go past just the team and the  game that's gonna work its way into the actual life 100 so when i got there it's like you're on our  team i was like well i can't play my knees fast which yeah oh good yeah i didn't want to know part  of it so i played a lot of horseshoe love horseshoe and basically just walked the track and that was  basically all i did yeah stay in shape they're telling us we have to wrap he's very very busy i want to  plug the book yes uh it's called doc you gotta wrap they sell a million books for this guy  publicists that's what they told us this is the stop it's the publicist there's a publicist

[03:16:30]  do one let's say uh oh teddy in pittsburgh his cousin's wife is the c-word um would that be cunt  hi buddy oh i can't hear you okay there you are you can't hear me now i can now i can what's the  matter all right well my cousin is like a brother to me we grew up together uh got married about eight  years ago to this woman um who worked for him he is a doctor uh she ever since i got married she's 
[03:17:00]  kind of been a kind okay but whatever you know she is what she is so about two years ago she started  filling out prescriptions uh in his name uh sending them to all members of her family  um going to different pharmacies and filling them um and wound up getting fired for it okay uh just 
[03:17:30]  recently my cousin had to sit in front of a board uh because he may get fired because he left his pad  out you know what i mean right um so just two days ago i'm in the visit uh it's been five weeks she's  been sober uh sober from pills so she's drinking while i'm there they get into this huge fight  she throws cheesecake at his face uh he winds up knocking the couch over and like punching her 
[03:18:00]  basically she bites him she bites him on his hand uh neither one of them and and they both wake up in  the morning like nothing happened well what is your question they're obviously in a dysfunctional  marriage no i can't say no mate hold on uh i don't know go to the cops about what i don't know  dude i just i i love him to death and i hate seeing him like this i mean they're both saying to each 
[03:18:30]  other i fucking hate you i wish you were dead um you know i i wish i never met you the most horrible  things you're gonna have you talked to him have you let me ask you going to the cops i don't know  because the cops aren't going to do anything because they won't press charges on each other  so have you actually spoken to him about it and said look what's going on with this okay whatever  his yeah his response jim is is you know maybe it's the doctor in me that wants to help her you  know she's been sick she's you know she has had pain which is why she's on the pain medication but 
[03:19:00]  then she started to abuse it look he's he's obviously codependent with her now if it's a woman being  beaten or even a man if it's spousal abuse that's happening uh then you might want to alert somebody  but from what it sounds like they just have a shitty marriage i don't know what the cops can do  about it and i think that sometimes you just have to let people make disasters out of their life i mean  if you've talked to him they're not going to press charges on each other i just don't know if there's 
[03:19:30]  anything that you can do um is there any i mean what would you say to him to i would be honest  be honest about how you feel that's all you can do is to go to him and go look i'm concerned because  it looks like you guys have some abuse you don't look happy but you've obviously talked to him and  his codependence is i'm a doctor i want to fix her so what can you do you can't and again there's a big  difference between this and somebody who's in a relationship where they're being abused if that's 
[03:20:00]  happening then i say go to the police but uh it just sounds like they just have a very dysfunctional  unhappy marriage if you've spoken your mind and you've made your opinion known there's i don't  know if there's anything else you can do other than you know because then they're just going to hate  you and just separate from you anyway personally i let people live their lives um you know i don't know  what else i can do for people you can only talk to them you can't make them do what you want them to  do all right brother all right brother i love you thank you man i appreciate your call uh glenn in dc 
[03:20:30]  has a really clingy and dependent girlfriend hey what's up jim hi glenn um so yeah i've been dating  this girl for about a year and a half and uh get along great and uh i i really do uh you know love her  and and we have a good relationship the only you know the big issue is um you know i'm in grad school  full-time and i bartend a few nights a week so i have a very busy schedule she's got a regular nine 
[03:21:00]  to five job um and the problem is she doesn't really have any friends uh down here and you know  not much of a social life so when i'm busy doing what i'm doing you know from what i gather basically  she's just sitting at home doing nothing being lonely and kind of you know texting me a lot um  you know wishing i was there and so you know sometimes when i have a night off or i have free 
[03:21:30]  time i don't necessarily want to spend it with her but we don't live together right um you want to have  your own life and independent friends and all that stuff exactly right and uh you know as as is  understandable i mean it's been a year and a half she kind of is pushing the moving in together thing  and especially in a city where it's expensive to live on your own it does make sense financially  but it's kind of coming to the point where you know it's it's either to to go all in or or fold  and um you know i don't know how to tell somebody you know in in their late 20s how to how to make 
[03:22:00]  friends and how to develop their own social life well let me ask you and again sorry to interrupt you  because i kind of know where you go like have you said to her hey um i feel like this is because  what happens with codependency is one person or both people fall into it where one person becomes  the other person's world totally and then it's really unhealthy because every time you don't spend  your free time with them they're like what's wrong what are you doing and then the person who's become 
[03:22:30]  that world feels this fucking unbearable pressure to be everything to the other person you know it's just  too much and it's not healthy you should both have your own friends and your own lives and your  activities and then you you have a great life together like you never want to feel in a relationship  like hey i'm i'm spending time with you right now because there's nothing else for us to do  so you want it to be because you both want to be together in that moment so uh have you talked to  her and said look this is too much um i've tried to and and i think she gets defensive and i mean i mean 
[03:23:00]  look it's it's not i'm sure it's got to be you know unpleasant to to to admit or realize you know  you don't really have much of a of a social life or you know you don't have much going on so i don't  know it's you know i feel like an asshole sometimes because i i tell her like i don't want to spend time  and what do i end up doing i end up doing nothing but i i love it because it's my time of course 
[03:23:30]  there's nothing wrong with that like and then and then that's what happens too in these codependent  things is that we start to feel guilty when we take time for ourselves or like we're doing something  wrong because the other person puts a guilt trip or sulk so that's silent scorn they talk about  you know i don't think you're doing from what you're telling me it doesn't sound like you're doing  anything wrong by taking free time and if you move in together do you think this is going to get any  better or it's just going to become more claustrophobic and smothering it's it's going  to become smothering i mean it's it's it's the kind of thing where i i would i think i would feel 
[03:24:00]  trapped and i think that unfortunately myself that would also make me you know act out and and maybe  even look to you know do some some bad things well you know if you're feeling that way then i would  suggest definitely not moving in um give it some time talk to her though maybe she'll say okay i've  been a little codependent uh but if she hasn't and she's not going to change then why live with  someone who's going to smother you completely because that's not love that's just that's like 
[03:24:30]  living with a blanket on you all the time and she's not going to be happy either so my suggestion again  a lot of times i say the suggestion is to talk to somebody because a lot of people don't talk things  out and sometimes when you say to somebody like look i want a little bit of space as long as they know  that you love them and you're not trying to get away from them like you know some people will  interpret that as i want to be away from you and that's not the case it's like hey i just want to  i want us to breathe a little bit so we we last longer exactly hey uh one one quick question and  i'll hang up and listen okay but could you if we use this term a few times uh on this show and it 
[03:25:00]  always kind of resonated with me but i don't really uh understand exactly what you're talking about but  uh life on life's terms i just wanted to talk a little bit more about that okay uh my understanding of  life on life's terms is that like a lot of times people especially when we're active in doug in  boston i'm going to get to you in just a second um and this kind of ties into what doug wants to  talk about as well is dealing with life as it comes um like i i obsess over circumstances outside 
[03:25:30]  myself like oh i'm unhappy because i don't have this in my career or i'm unhappy because my friend is  sick or i'm i'm behaving in unhealthy fashion because of this and you can live a happy life and a  very productive and successful life just dealing with life as it comes meaning don't try to control  everything that happens and don't try to base your happiness on everything around you because  bad shit's going to happen unhealthy stuff is going to happen so try to live a healthy productive life 
[03:26:00]  in spite of the stuff around you that is inevitably going to go on so uh now doug sat in the park  yesterday with a gun questions about recovery programs hi doug in boston thanks for calling  hey no problem jimmy so now you sat in the park with a gun what do you mean i mean i mean i mean i  mean i know what you mean but explain that yeah um it's you know i'm like everybody else who's in  recovery or trying to get into recovery i'm you know one of those people who have addictive 
[03:26:30]  personalities and has had them forever yeah you know cocaine sexual addiction uh alcohol dope whatever  everything and uh uh uh for the last couple of weeks maybe a couple of months where i've kind of  had this thing where i'm like you know i can't do it anymore i'm tired i have um i have uh admitted  mistakes in the past i've fucked up and i'm tired of uh saying you know i did it again well let me ask you 
[03:27:00]  are you sober now or are you really struggling to try to get sober uh i'm i don't even know if i'm  struggling to try and get sober i'm not sober now okay well let me suggest i mean i'm just go just to  just to cut you off for one second you know you're talking about all this pain and i'm ready to give up  and i can't see that's where we are before we get sober like in a weird way you're hitting bottom 
[03:27:30]  that's a good thing like most people don't want to get sober when things are going great it's when  we feel like we you know they say we you know we're at the jumping off place and we wish for the  end well that's a lot of times the catalyst to an amazing life on the other side but you have to make  the effort to do it uh the fact that you sat with the gun and you didn't blow your brains out and that  that you're calling the show means that there's a part of you understands that right now you're at 
[03:28:00]  this you're at this jumping off place but there is if you do the right thing and i'm telling you this  an amazing life you do not have to jump and you shouldn't jump okay i don't i don't believe it  jimmy i really don't i know and i and i understand the not believing it too because i didn't believe it  either dude i i can only sometimes i wish i could take people who are suffering like like you are  right now and put you where i am and i know i bitch and i moan but my life is fucking great and it's all 
[03:28:30]  great because i did things that other people suggested i do even though i didn't necessarily  believe it was going to work out as well as they told me it would you know sometimes you just got to  believe that they believe it like all these other people telling you look there's a great life waiting  for you if you just put down the stuff that's hurting you and start on a recovery path like look 
[03:29:00]  where you are right now this is where your best thinking got you sitting in a park with a fucking  pistol so realize that at this moment you can't trust your own thinking your own thinking right now  stinks it will improve but right now it's not good so listen to other people who have been through  that kind of suffering and found a way through it like i have no motive to lie to you no i hear you  and it makes sense to me the problem i have is that i've been down this road before okay sure where i 
[03:29:30]  have you know i i have fucked up you know lost my job sure uh you're fooled around my wife when she was  pregnant and it's the last thing i want to do again is to say here i am again you know i just  i have a real problem  with saying uh just living with the fact that i cannot seem to get my shit together yeah it's a 
[03:30:00]  lot of times dude there are people who struggle for a long time before they get it there's people  who come in and out they get sober they relapse they get sober they relapse you know they say  insanity is repeating the same thing over and over again expecting a different result well alcoholics  addicts gamblers compulsive eaters we we understand insanity better than everybody because that's our  pattern it's a pattern nobody just all of a sudden does something once and realizes oh boy i'm 
[03:30:30]  fucked up we get into these crazy patterns some people it's going to prison uh you know for me it  was it was cutting myself with a razor or whatever it was for you it's starting to get sober then  relapsing like you know for all of us it's different things so just realize that what you want to do is  break the pattern so you can break the pattern but if you have to be willing to surrender and how much  more do you need like the fight's over doug it won surrender the addiction is undefeated it beats all of 
[03:31:00]  us so it's beaten you to me i'm 51 years old okay okay so okay what i just kind of feel like i'm done i  don't i can't start my life over at 51 i don't feel like that's an option for me but of course it's an  option back in the old days when people got sober they got sober a lot older there's a lot of people  who could come in and get like rodney dangerfield he did stand up and then i think his name was 
[03:31:30]  jack roy and then he quit for years went into aluminum siding and then came back and become  famous when he was probably in his late 40s early 50s like the people's the way your life is going to  work out we don't know but you're 51 you're not dead people live to be 80 90 years old these days with  fucking medicine and technology you could have 40 years left you could have 40 years like who's to  say you don't have to go back to your childhood but you can stop being fucking crazy right now 
[03:32:00]  and whatever time you have left you can live productive and happy don't give yourself an excuse  what about the fact that i have two young children and you know a wife that i'm not crazy about  okay whatever it is what it is but now i have to come out and i have to say hey listen you know  this is where i'm at uh i've been down this road before and they know i have okay lost my job now 
[03:32:30]  we're back again to where we were how old are your kids uh 12 and 14. so think of them you're saying i'm  51 on this think of your both your kids graduating high school or college or getting married and having  a fucking empty seat there because you were too embarrassed to tell people i'm here again and  decided to shoot yourself in a park think of the self-centeredness of that what that will do to them  or as opposed to okay i do i i hear it hey dude trust me i have struggled with this for a while 
[03:33:00]  then i'm just then doug i'm not i'm not shitting on you i'm not i'm not going i'm not like with you  listen i know you know it but you got to really know it and the only way to really know it is to do  it like so don't tell people i'm here again don't say it just either go to a rehab or start going to  a 12-step program or start doing all right well see here's the other problem okay uh both of my 
[03:33:30]  parents died in the last four years all right and they were raging alcoholics sure okay yeah my mom  actually put together uh probably 30 years of sobriety and she lived and breathed the program  and i swear to god if and i you and i have had this discussion before i like the whole thing about  all of the catchphrases and it just used to drive me fucking crazy and it still does well my father  was been sober since i was two so i understand the catchphrases and a lot of times we associate 
[03:34:00]  getting clean and sober with uh a parent or whatever it is but again look at the option like the option  is you are sitting in a park with a pistol that's now i know the slogans yeah sometimes they're a little  irritating oh god that's cliche but what's the better option to see your kids graduate from high  school and college and get married and have coffee and hear a couple of shitty slogans or to fucking 
[03:34:30]  shoot yourself in a park like realize that this is that place they talk about you you know what you have  to do you you can get better you can lead a very very productive life and make yourself proud and make  your family proud and i know the temptation is to feel sorry for ourselves and oh god i've blown it  life is over but this is where you are right now accept where you are and begin moving forward stop  complaining about it just go fuck it i lived through this experience so far you're not dead you didn't 
[03:35:00]  fucking overdose you didn't drink yourself to death you didn't drive into a pole and get killed so so far  you've survived it so my suggestion would be to again you know what the right thing to do is  you already know it so i would suggest acting on the right thing and just begin doing the right  thing don't tell people don't need to make a fucking speech about it just begin doing it your life will 
[03:35:30]  get better i promise last thing last thing i know you got other guys okay no no i know last thing i  want to say is that jimmy all the stuff you're saying i have lived every day i wake up in the  morning and i i process it i know how it goes i've been around addiction i actually have been through  90 days 90 meetings you know i had cocaine addiction i had everything else but what happens is  is that i have to get this thought in my head where it's like you know what i need to hit the 
[03:36:00]  reset switch and i think my kids and my family are going to be better if i'm not around i i know the  irrational thinking and i know that you know all this stuff but somebody once told me knowledge is  no defense against the first drink what i know doesn't mean anything it's what i do and i really mean  i know that sounds so trite and cliche but the reason i i have a productive life and and and i  feel like i've achieved a lot by being clean and sober is because i did and i have to let you go doug 
[03:36:30]  because we do have other people but i really i do care about you getting better and i really mean that  man uh knowing something doesn't make it so it's a nice step but i have to act right i have to do the  right thing so doug honestly you know what the right thing is stop listening to yourself start  listening to other people man because you don't want to fucking shoot yourself in a park your kids  14 and 12 and they got to live with that it's fucking terrible they would not be better off without 
[03:37:00]  you um all right sorry about uh you know i don't mean to keep belaboring belaboring am i saying that  right to keep repeating the same point but i you know good luck to you doug and don't give up uh  yes jeff in new hampshire how to deal with this five-year-old who told a girl that girls like to  sit on boys i'm a little uh yes jeff how you doing hey how are you buddy well i'm all right my wife is  like freaking out but um a couple of months ago my wife had the kids come upstairs from they woke up 
[03:37:30]  and went down to the basement and started watching tv and my son who's five comes upstairs and says mommy  i'm done watching the show where the girls but there are the boys put their peepees in the girls vaginas  so uh my wife went downstairs and the kids had bought pay-per-view on the dish network we didn't  know they knew how to get there okay and uh bought some hardcore porn well last week uh i guess my son  at daycare was with a girl underneath the picnic table we know all about that yeah and uh told the  girl that boys girls like to sit on boys peepees and uh now the daycare provider the owner of the company 
[03:38:00]  told my wife yesterday that the girl went home and started asking her mom and dad questions so  now my wife wants to do this all this safe play date crap psychologist all this shit what do you suggest  well um again without having children and having had that experience i can just speculate but i think  when you watch obviously which what he saw in pornography and i don't know how much good it does to sit 
[03:38:30]  down and talk to him but i certainly would suggest talking to him and asking him why he did that  maybe you could just tell him that that's not the right way to be because i know a lot of that's  normal shit too like a lot of you know boys and girls explore i know i did when i was a kid but look  you know look how i turned out i'm certainly not an exemplary fucking example of uh sexual and emotional  health so you might want to nip it in the bud and talk to him and i don't know how much psychology  would help but some safe play dates might help to show uh him the proper way to interact with 
[03:39:00]  kids his own age because you don't want him going down a really sexual road that early obviously  well i think the biggest problem is it's not my son because i mean we know we all did that  shit when we were kids um drawing the playboys doing i'll show you mine you show me yours kind of crap  uh but my wife was molested by her cousin when she was younger so she's the one that i'm i'm more  concerned with dealing with because she is just freaking out are you afraid she might be overreacting  i i know she's overreacting but you can't tell her that because she's had that experience and and how 
[03:39:30]  do you tell somebody that has had that happen to them that they're overreacting without without  sounding callous and yeah yeah yeah it's um it's tough that's a very tough call again dude i don't  have kids with kid questions i take a stab at it but i never want to come off like i have to me my  most advice i give that i i try to give is uh experiential i can only kind of really talk to  what i know but with kids my suggestion would be talk to other parents about it because uh 
[03:40:00]  i don't want to give the wrong advice when it comes to children and sexual  shit i would always suggest talking to a kid first but maybe maybe she's right  maybe a structured play date would help perfect all right thank you buddy and sorry i didn't have  better suggestions for you i just i can't pretend i know something i don't david in new york fiance  of seven years left yeah she uh she just left uh after seven years about six weeks ago no word just  stopped taking my phone calls acted like a real uh but i can't get over it today would be our 
[03:40:30]  anniversary seven years wow um and how long ago this happened uh about six weeks ago six months ago my  dad died i'm just uh i'm reeling man wow uh what and and now were there indications that there were  problems with her maybe a little bit i mean we never really sat down and talked i i know  we both wanted to get a place together money was always an issue you know we both wanted to get  married and she got a new job which is making a lot of money and but she refused to sit down and 
[03:41:00]  talk to me well so she wanted out for whatever reason i guess yeah what was what were the indicators  that there were problems just that that she would talk to me and say you know we really got to find a  way to get a place together it's it's not going to work if if we keep going this way and you know i i  agreed with that but i just i went back to school to get certified to become a teacher and i just did that 
[03:41:30]  and i don't know i just don't know how she could just stop talking to me yeah i don't understand  that either there's obviously was something wrong maybe she's just shitty at dealing with things  or shitty at talking things out i think that's kind of rotten uh after all those years the only  thing you can say is hey man is as painful as it is at least you weren't married where you'd have  legal proceedings like as terrible as that is maybe she saved you more heartache than you'll ever 
[03:42:00]  realize she saved you because if she's going to allow after all that time you just to be swinging  in the breeze and not give you a real explanation or closure there's something very shitty about her  to do that there really is right yeah that's that's cold and it's kind of uh an excuse were you cheating  on her and again i don't know who you are what were you cheating no i wasn't um she did uh she did um  i had looked at some myspace pages you know i hadn't talked to anybody right sure and she had 
[03:42:30]  found them on my computer and then one day she logged into my myspace account and found a letter  that i had written to an ex-girlfriend saying you know i had a dream about you and but this was two  years later and i ended saying like you know maybe we could have been good but i'm real happy with what i  have now but that was years ago um i don't know buddy i mean you did try to talk to her how many 
[03:43:00]  times have you reached out well at first i went crazy and i you know did the whole texting her  constantly sure sure just talk to me and now what i did was i gave it three weeks today would be seven  years and i sent her um an apology email for you know because after a few days it got i said some  kind of nasty things to her sure i apologized for it and i said you know i know we're moving on but  can we please just talk and kind of leave things on better terms and i mean maybe she'll answer  today but i don't think so well she has an answer then then you know that that is her answer 
[03:43:30]  as much as it sucks and it's a lousy way to end it if she's ended it like that you have to move on  and maybe the closure you're looking for won't come sometimes you know we we obsess over things because  we want that final moment we want i guess because you know television and movies teaches us that there  is a moment at the end where you go and that's all it was door closed roll credits but a lot of times 
[03:44:00]  that's not the way real life works out a lot of times we don't get the closure we seek we  don't get the final word or the final comment or that final moment and you know it's painful but  you might just have to accept that that closure or that explanation is not going to come and that  it was just something really up in her that made her not able to communicate with you yeah can i ask  you one more thing should i um i could i could really get her in a bad spot i have some really bad  pictures nah don't do that man i in all honesty i have so many naked pictures of girls i've dated 
[03:44:30]  and there's nothing they've ever done that would cause me to betray that honestly no matter how  bad it was or how angry we've gotten you don't want to do that i think there's just something  really karma yeah i know and i know you're angry and i know it hurts but for your own sake like opie  gave the wallet back to that guy yesterday and the guy was a scumbag but i said dope you know what  dude you were right to give it back because it was about him giving it back not about that piece  of shit's reaction same thing here so what she's shitty fuck her but there's no reason for you to 
[03:45:00]  all of a sudden become an untrustworthy shitbag yeah should i just try and get somebody new of  course you should and you will dude you will all right thanks jimmy i i love your stand-up man it  gets me through a lot of bad times thank you dave and good luck to you buddy i'm sorry to hear that  that that happened to you thanks jim okay brother uh matt in iowa hi you're your grandfather went  through the same stuff as uh the guy in the park and he ended up what he ended up you know he he 
[03:45:30]  struggled with alcohol his whole life and probably some drugs and stuff and him my old man they weren't  the closest either but once he you know me my cousin my brother my other cousin were born he dropped all  the alcohol didn't touch it ever again oh good and and he was the greatest you know he was the  greatest grandfather a guy could have asked for and he you know he passed away when i was about 10 years  old uh just from complications of stroke and stuff okay but up for those 10 years i mean he didn't touch 
[03:46:00]  as soon as my cousin was born he's a year older than me i'm 30 he's 31 he didn't he just he just dropped it  all that's great he became sober he saw the light at the end of the tunnel so the guy in the park  you know there is light at the end of the tunnel whether he's close to his kids or not but once  he sees his grandkids or something like that you know things may change there's a lot more life  thank you very much for the call and i think you're absolutely right thank you buddy so much 
[03:46:30]  for calling and i think you're right there's a lot more life to be had for our 51 year old friend  from boston who called so do not give up um that's what that's what this guy's calling to tell you i'm  telling you and this other stranger is telling you don't give up um now somebody has a sandy is  sandy on the phone because she has a response to the guy uh or is she gone no i think that was  that call's gone yeah why do we have no i think she hung up a while ago it just didn't refresh the 
[03:47:00]  message oh okay okay uh oh boy um well jim in long island that's not as bad as i thought having an  affair with my son's teacher yes jim hey man um there's a lot of back story to this i'll just  try to give you the quick part of it um knock my girl knock my girl up she was married to somebody  else um knocked her up had a kid uh knocked her up again had a kid got married because i thought it  was just the right thing to do um i'm definitely i think i'm a sex addict but i don't know are you 
[03:47:30]  you married still i'm sorry you are married yeah okay less than a year and already having an affair  okay and uh i was fucking somebody also when we were engaged but just at work random random  shit um so you've been dishonest with this girl quite a few times without a doubt okay um so i met her  his teacher is smoking um she is a freak um which is kind of i dig it you know build those butt plugs  this nipple clamp shit i've never even seen before oh she's a good egg fuck um like all these 
[03:48:00]  different toys and shit that i never fucking even know they existed like she wants me to do all this  shit from 50 shades of gray to her um she loves you know she says she loves me and i just don't know  i just don't know if i can go through a whole divorce i get two sons that i fucking love is she  married this girl no she's single and she was engaged she had a heroin thing she's very unstable  so you know that what you're doing with her going through a divorce right now 
[03:48:30]  for this disaster and i'm not judging believe me i understand the desire to fuck her because i'm  i'm a weak man too so i would probably be right there can you just take her i certainly can i mean  she's a fucking mess she likes things in her ass she's right up my alley but uh and i believe me i  understand that temptation it's really fucking hard but sometimes women who are the greatest  fucks are the craziest and the reason somebody told me this once it made perfect sense is because 
[03:49:00]  their inhibitions are lowered so the same thing that makes them amazing fun fucks makes them very  very difficult in other areas and this is not in all cases but if she's on heroin and you're saying  she's a mess do you not anymore not anymore that was a while okay do you love the girl that you're married  to no way but you married her for what reason two kids okay two kids so you're in an unhappy  marriage you've cheated on this girl and you're probably going to continue cheating on her  isn't a divorce less painful i know financially it's a nightmare i know it's a bit to go through 
[03:49:30]  but in the end isn't it easier just to bite the bullet separate you know where you are and then  you can go out and fuck who you want and meet somebody who makes you happy and so can your wife  i just can't see myself well first of all i don't want anybody else raising my kids yeah that's  understandable second of all i just can't see myself going through that whole process like because  she was married before and it was such a big deal for her family to accept me um i just can't picture 
[03:50:00]  you're fucking doing i can't picture you going through all that shit again yeah but i can tell  you this if you keep having the affair you are going to eventually have to go through the divorce  anyway because someone's going to find out very rarely do these things go on especially in 2013  there's texting there's facebook there's everything is savable something will happen where you will  probably get caught and end up in a disastrous painful divorce where there are things that are 
[03:50:30]  exposed that you don't want exposed that are humiliating so yes if i do cut her off and shut  it down with the affair do i ever tell my wife no why would you tell her no as it says uh in one of  the setting is i don't have any fucking guilt dude and the other reason we can't get divorced because  we're in a we're in a profession where me and her at the forefront of a lot of things it's kind of  it's a it's a profession that um it wouldn't be seen as a good thing to get divorced well again what  other people and i understand that and maybe it's a job i can't comprehend but what other people 
[03:51:00]  think is irrelevant you're personally not happy with each other obviously and you're  fucking a woman behind your wife's back and again i don't judge you for that because it's it's i'm a  weak man too but don't worry about what other people think can't stay married to someone because  what other people think that seems like a horrible way to live because if they can imagine what these  people are going to think if you get caught with a butt plug the fucking social studies teacher  fingering your rectum and there's photos and texts and all your private thoughts come out 
[03:51:30]  i mean that would be embarrassing for me and i'm a pervert that everybody knows  imagine you a married father of two in a job where you're scared of getting divorced  how'd you know i was a social studies teacher are you i saying the woman oh she's like a daycare uh  i was actually joking about the woman being a social studies teacher are you really  yeah yeah i didn't know you were a teacher that was actually a complete uh you just  fucking you just uh fessed up and you didn't have to uh my wife works in the building oh in what 
[03:52:00]  building with me oh i think an art mysterious building um okay yeah i understand that but again  uh you know i i was joking that the wife was the uh the uh the other teacher was but uh well can you  take this girl's info and just take her for me no if i wanted to be anybody i wanted to be you you're  a good man um i gotta i gotta let you go have her email me at the real jim norton at gmail.com  and tell her to say hey it's the good egg teacher all right my friend you got it jim thank you all  right good luck uh who's here stuck in uh when i go to bed i don't want to wake up in the morning 
[03:52:30]  um that's jim from the opian anthony show calling it yes sir who are you good morning hi buddy  how you doing jimmy i'm okay so you're obviously suffering from depression  uh pretty much major depression and why are you suffering from it many things have happened in my  life okay um it's been a non-stop roller coaster ride for 40 something years all right do you drink 
[03:53:00]  and do drugs are you are you a compulsive gambler or none of those i take medication but for various  reasons um i don't know enough about medication is it legit or are you addicted to it when you when you  when you and honestly analyze it i'm honestly telling you that it's legit okay they're all  prescribed and they're not overtaken okay so what is your now do you take anything for your depression  or do you what do you do to help combat your depression well they're talking about putting 
[03:53:30]  me on prozac so supposedly gonna help me but honestly the only reason i care to wake up in the  morning is to listen to the show and honestly other than that i have nothing else i mean i'm 40  something years old never been married don't have any kids so i have nothing but my family who  uh obviously has does not want to have anything to do with me why don't they want to have anything  to do with you without various reasons that's their problem i don't know honestly i've never  gotten into it with them you've never asked them why they don't want anything to do with you 
[03:54:00]  yeah um you have no girlfriend so you sound very lonely definitely and what kind of work do you do  you don't have to say where you work but what field is it the field of work that i was in because  i'm no longer working on my own okay well you have to tell that was it a job that was satisfying  you and that you loved uh i was a driver truck driver okay and you're unemployed for how long 
[03:54:30]  it's been three years now oh wow okay so that obviously contributes to the for men  i mean you obviously maybe have had depression issues before but for men our jobs are so much a  part of our identity and who we are and what we see ourselves as as men the ability to provide and  when we're not working we feel fairly worthless we look around like we are just these fucking  dead branches on this tree i agree are you trying to get another job i am in no position 
[03:55:00]  at this point i'm actually looking to fight mr elliot spitzer on uh a law that passed back in march  because i'm not i'm not i'm not in a position to be able to work any longer or do the work that i was  able to do why is that it's it's called being a dislocated worker what does that mean dislocated  worker it means that the field of work that i was in because of the lack of education that i do have  which is just a high school diploma okay um um i do not have any actual interior interior office skills so 
[03:55:30]  um i don't have the ability i could probably go back to school but by the time i go back to school  i would be very close to retirement and as you know probably the older you get the harder the  jobs are there sure sure they're all looking for young guys with you know  fucking piss and vinegar in their eyes and college educated degree yeah and i understand but what you  will you have what do you do this depression you're suffering from there has to are you are you able 
[03:56:00]  to drive a truck anymore well with the conditions that i do have it it irritates the problems that  i do have well what are the conditions you have i mean we don't know each other you're anonymous  yeah i know um i have problems with my back and neck and other issues okay on the focus of the  physical issues that make your your old form of uh employment very difficult to duplicate that's  very correct so again without knowing you what you have to do you know you do go into bed not 
[03:56:30]  wanting to wake up and believe me i understand that feeling and i felt that way too but that's  no way to live like you know you're not just this fucking replaceable thing you're not just some  fucking forgettable spoke and i really mean that you know that you have a life that's still ahead of  you and it's easy for me to say and it's try it and it's corny but why would you allow yourself  to go out like this like you should fight for getting your life back to where you want it you're not 
[03:57:00]  unfuckable i don't even know what you look like everybody can find somebody you know you're not  unemployable i've been in scenarios and i've been engaged before but i've never come to the point  where i felt like i was actually going to get married only because the people that i was with  were were pieces of shit okay were you behaving like a piece of shit no so why did you settle for  people who are pieces of shit if anything you don't know somebody within the first two years of 
[03:57:30]  of going out with them it usually takes longer than two years to find out who these people usually are  so you know what uh i don't know i was gonna say like you said that you don't know who they are  but i don't know man like a lot of times abused girls marry abusive men when they get older we seek  out certain things because we have radar i think that we understand much more than we admit to  ourselves that we understand about people when we date them which is why the children of alcoholics 
[03:58:00]  date and marry alcoholics i didn't know you was an alcoholic of course you did the personality you  smelled it you saw it you felt it so what happens is we seek out people to serve certain purposes for  us and i don't believe it takes two years at all i think a lot of times we know enough we know  certain things we pick up certain things very very quickly uh and i mean look i'm sure dude in cases  there yeah there's like ted bundy's girlfriend i'm sure didn't know he was fucking raping and 
[03:58:30]  murdering 12 year olds but i think sometimes we have to examine why do i seek out the type of person  i've been seeking out like what are they doing for me these miserable fucks why are they the ones i'm  looking for why am i not seeking out people that are going to make me happy so do you go to therapy  at all uh i've been in therapy uh but as i was saying the exact the exact reason is not just the  the girls or the or the issues that i've got whether it's everything that's around me puts me 
[03:59:00]  in the position where i would rather not wake up and have to deal with society because i have  more than half of them are fucked up you know you're right but like i said before somebody asked  about life on life's terms this is exactly what we're talking about i agree everything around  me look i you know the serenity prayer you don't even have to look at it religiously but it's you  know uh uh great it's ready to accept you know the uh curse change things i can the wisdom except  these are kind of change courage change things i can and the wisdom to know the difference like 
[03:59:30]  there's things that i can't change and uh those are the things i have to accept and the things that  you can change you change like the serenity prayer is one of the greatest believe me i don't  practice it nearly as much as i should and take out god if you want if you're an atheist  fuck who cares but it's okay well i brought up strict christian but i'm at the age now because of  all that all that uh priest and bullshit okay fair enough whatever whatever your reasons are  um but wouldn't you like the ability just as a person to accept the things you can't change 
[04:00:00]  and the courage to change the things you can't that you can and the ability and wisdom to know the  difference i mean without the god part that's still such a fucking beautiful and simple way  to look at things what's outside of you what's happening you have no fucking control over you  have no control so to allow it to dictate your happiness is crazy it's literally like being  fucking obsessed with the lakers or the mets and i allow my happiness to be dictated on how many points  fucking kobe scores you have no control over that so change the things you can well i'd like to be 
[04:00:30]  able to do things that are you know would be considered at this point you know against the  law these people that are around me but you can't do that dude that's crazy no no and i and i realize  that but you know honestly i i refrain from from socializing just because most of the people that  i do interact with you know is are terrible you know i mean they have terrible places and then 
[04:01:00]  that they're not great people but you have that that's what's the beauty of being an adult we have  choices as to who we hang with and who we interact with and we have to realize that sometimes we  associate people who are shitty because there's shitty things going on inside of ourselves and  that's what we think we deserve and that's what we attract so if i change myself and change the  things i can a lot of times i attract different people in my life and it sounds corny and fucking  12-step but it really is true like i have good friends man i'm not the greatest guy in the world 
[04:01:30]  and i have to let you go because i have to do a read but i i appreciate i thank you jimmy i thank you  and i appreciate you call let me uh you take it my call and you have a good day man you too buddy and  keep waking up dude i understand the depression but please try to work on it and fix it don't kill  yourself it i'm not saying you're going to but it's just such a fucking sad and sickening way  for things to end temporary it's a permanent solution to a temporary problem even if your  problem has been going on for a long time uh the depression does not define who you are 
[04:02:00]  and there is a way to live with it and to live productively with it change the things you can inside  yourself and you will attract a better group of people like i have really good people in my life  and it's you know what i'm because i'm a loyal guy i'm not perfect and i'm not never shitty and  i know you guys on the air have me be negative but you know what like i really do care about my  friends and i really do try to be there for my friends and i really do love my friends and i i i'm 
[04:02:30]  positive and i work you know believe it or not like there's a part of me that you don't see on the  air that's actually fairly positive and healthy um and so i attract people like that you know like  for as much as you know you think that open ant and myself and colin all these comedians  are negative shitheads we are people who despite being dysfunctional asses which all of us are  have found a way to do what we love in spite of all the obstacles we put in front of ourselves 
[04:03:00]  so if i could do that and anthony and opie can do that and colin and fucking uh uh you know all these  bobby kelly you can do it too so that's why we attract people like uh ourselves because we're  doing things that are positive for ourselves and forgive me if that's fucking too you know out there  and fucking you know it sounds like something here on wbls you know be positive and positivity will come  to you um i'm gonna take another caller so i'll do the quick live read uh not to get it out of the  way because i hate always ending on a live read so i want to end on a call uh are you sick of going

[04:06:30]  still call your sponsor yeah oh yeah yeah um and let me tell you jimmy my wife and i we listen to you  all the time you know we thank you i'm really freaked out right now yeah and you know maybe 
[04:07:00]  this is good radio but let me tell you man i don't know what to do you know what patrick you here's what  happened and and and not that there's good news but you honestly do know what to do because you picked  up the phone okay you fucked up and i know like as as alcoholics and people in recovery we get caught  up in the time i got 20 years i got 15 years but there was something that was missed 17 years gone  but it's not gone you didn't you patrick you didn't lose you're still alive those 17 years are not lost 
[04:07:30]  you've changed the date okay and i know it's ego deflating and it's hard big time big time but you do  know uh no matter how far down the scale we've gone we see how our experience can benefit others  this is something that is going to help other people because it was the last call and it's why  i looked at it because i'm sober for a while and i'm not above blowing sobriety you're going to help 
[04:08:00]  other people with this if you come back it's it's not a wasted 17 years patrick you didn't drunk drive  and kill somebody you're not going to jail right if you want to really think of what could have  happened last night your first drink after 17 years could have been you plowing into a car  it wasn't right so you're alive and you're going to change the date and i know it hurts
