<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of the 2002 Winter Olympics men's figure skating competition, focusing on the judging controversy and the performance of Timothy Goebel.  The hosts peppered their analysis with homophobic jokes and stereotypes about male figure skaters.  Andrew "Dice" Clay then called in, delivering a rambling, vulgar, and offensive stand-up routine titled "Dice on Ice," filled with sexual innuendo and racial slurs, interacting with the hosts and a caller named Frenchy.  Studio guest "Jamaican Mike" joined the conversation, sharing sexually suggestive anecdotes about his life in Jamaica. This segment included a phone-in game, "What's in My Pants?", with Jamaican Mike and a female caller, Becca, featuring sexually suggestive descriptions and innuendo. The show continued with further discussion and jokes about the experiences of men whose girlfriends or fiancés visited Jamaica.

The conversation then shifted to the perceived large penis size of Jamaican men, with numerous callers sharing graphic and sexually explicit anecdotes.  Callers recounted experiences in Jamaica, focusing on the sexual aspects of their trips, often using crude and offensive language.  The show then abruptly changed gears to a discussion of New York Yankees outfielder Ruben Rivera stealing Derek Jeter's glove, leading to a humorous (according to the hosts) bit where the hosts and callers created a list of bizarre and offensive sports memorabilia items, including bodily fluids and diseased tissues.  A listener then called, seeking to arrange a meeting between Pamela Lee and a dying child; however, the hosts' response quickly devolved into sexually suggestive comments, abruptly ending this segment.

Comedian Brian Regan joined the show as a guest. The hosts joked about his "clean" comedy style before Regan discussed the challenges of being a comedian, sharing anecdotes about awkward fan encounters and his experiences performing at Dangerfield's.  The conversation turned to the hosts' early days on WNEW, their evolving show format (including the elimination of music and the introduction of a delay to avoid FCC fines), and their censor. Regan shared a story about a fan offended by his use of the word "pissed off," highlighting his commitment to clean comedy.  The hosts and Regan then engaged in a humorous exchange about Regan’s self-deprecating comedy descriptions.  The discussion briefly touched upon Evil Knievel and his son Robbie, and the lack of regulation in the daredevil world.  A caller, Bill Wisnowski, requested information about hearing aids, leading to a humorous exchange.  The show promoted upcoming segments ("Bikini Softball 2," "Keith Norton's World Tour," and "Sex for Sam").  Further calls included listeners praising Regan's comedy, leading to Regan performing snippets of his act ("cobweb," "donut lady," and "cup of dirt" bits), and a caller’s discussion of a personal experience at a Dairy Barn prompting Regan’s school plurals bit.  The show concluded with a call referencing a previous Regan appearance and a joking debate between the hosts about who made the "sickest" comment, culminating in Anthony's extended, sexually suggestive Brady Bunch bit.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Here, check it out, the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple minutes of feedback to Jay from Medicine.  Hey, Ann, I see your boy, Timmy Gaywad.  Gaywad.  Won himself a purdy little medal.  Tell us, purdy little medal.  Did you spill your zima as you frolicked about in your chupu?  Stop it.  Well, you must be excited that the Canadians finally got their gold.  Well, yes.  I do believe you started that campaign for everybody. 
[00:00:30]  I actually did.  I was one of the first to say that they should have gotten the gold.  A lot of controversy.  The French figure skating judge has been suspended for buckling under, again, just like the French.  It turns out that all the judges went to this hotel room,  and the French judge was muscled by the Russian judges to vote for the Russian.  Muscled. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah, muscled.  They just, and the French judge, okay, but, yeah, well, listen, they're all women.  They're all even the men are women.  There's no such thing.  It's redundant French woman.  Redundant.  So they got her in the hotel room, and, uh, yes, I will give you the vote for a pair of figure skating.  And then, uh, in return, the French were supposed to win the ice dancing, which starts up, uh, when is that, Rick? 
[00:01:30]  Do you know when the ice dancing starts?  Tomorrow.  Tomorrow.  The ice dancing.  Oh, you're going to have a busy weekend, Anthony.  But now the whole controversy is the French were favored for the ice dancing to win,  but now it's going to look like, hey, if the French win,  now it's just the reciprocation on part of the Russian judges, and we're still, uh, screwed.  So, uh, I can't wait for the ice dancing.  So the, uh, men's single, uh, figure skating last night, the second half, or the long program, Opie.  Yeah, you explained the short program, and now it's the long program. 
[00:02:00]  And, of course, um, Timothy Gable for the United States was, uh, sitting in third,  and on a big man junk, for, after the short program.  And then, uh, going into the long program, very exciting last night.  And, uh, he pulled out a bronze medal.  Well, from where?  From where, Rick says.  He pulled out a bronze.  So he got the bronze.  Well, the Russians, uh, won that.  The, uh, Russian guy, I don't remember his name, I don't know. 
[00:02:30]  With the cute blonde hair?  No, he came in second.  He got the silver.  I didn't see that guy's skate.  The guy with the blonde mullet?  Oh, oh, oh.  Mullet?  Yeah.  And the Russian that won is actually, he lives in Connecticut.  He's becoming a U.S. citizen, so it's...  Isn't that fascinating, Norton?  Yeah.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  But, uh, Timothy Gable, boy, when he finished his, uh, routine, and went back and held his  little teddy bear waiting for his score.  Right.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[00:03:00]  Sean has a great observation that I think a lot of us saw last night.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Sean.  Hey, guys.  Uh, first time in Olympic history that a male figure skater had a wife and kids.  Yeah, this was...  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Unbelievable.  What is that guy's name?  White?  But how shocked were you to find out that one of the male figure skaters has a family, a wife?  I was shocked.  See you later, honey.  I'm going to the rink.  Gonna go figure skate with the guys.  Gonna go figure skate.  Because you know what it is.  Bring my cooler of beer.  He comes out on the ice, and, uh, they say, yeah, it's his last, uh, Olympics. 
[00:03:30]  He's only 25, but he's, uh, not gonna skate anymore.  He's going back.  He lives in Fairfax, Virginia.  I hear he listens, uh, to WJFK in, uh, Washington.  How about that one?  And, um, he says he's, uh, not gonna be in the Olympics anymore because he wants to spend  more time with his children and his wife.  And I'm like, stop it.  What?  What?  Actually, he's not gonna skate anymore because he finally figured it out.  It's a gay sport.  After looking around for years, he goes, cheers!  Christ, what the hell am I him? 
[00:04:00]  Hey, being married doesn't mean anything, man.  You ever see Dog Day Afternoon?  But, you know, he's married to him.  Why do you do this?  You're not dying.  You're killing everyone around you.  You're killing everyone around you.  You guys suck.  Oh, you gotta stop this.  It's craziness.  Algeria, they run around with a bunch of things on their head.  They're crazy people.  Crazy people.  You thought Wisconsin was a country?  Michael Weiss from Fairfax, Virginia.  So, he comes out on the ice and they show his wife. 
[00:04:30]  She's like a blonde, big blonde bombshell type.  And, um, his father.  And he skates out and he looks like just some Italian guy.  He's like got the slicked back hair.  And he goes into the routine.  And I'm like, I even said to my girlfriend, I go, how does a heterosexual guy emote with his body like that?  Like he's dancing on the ice.  He does the arm thing.  You can expect it from the gay guys that are figure skating. 
[00:05:00]  You know, they're very artistic and their arms are going.  And they're doing all those hand things.  Like, look, I'm grabbing at the sun.  You know, and things like that.  But, it's like, yeah, I expect the guy to go, honey, I thought I signed up for hockey.  I put the skates on and, uh, I don't know what happened.  But then he starts his, uh, routine.  And he's just as gay on the ice as the gay guys.  And then he gets done and he walks off the ice and that's it.  Yeah, pops a beer, I guess.  Was he holding a teddy bear or something? 
[00:05:30]  He wasn't holding the teddy bear, no.  All the gay guys got little, I guess it's their good luck charms when they finish their skating.  And they're sitting on the chair waiting for the marks to come in.  They hold little things like a teddy bear.  One guy had the, uh, the eye from, uh, Monsters, Inc.  You know, that character.  He was holding that very tightly.  Those are just the first gifts they got in the hospital after being beaten by skinheads.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  But he's just like an Italian guy out there.  I'm trying hard. 
[00:06:00]  I, you know, I like the figure skating.  It's a new direction for me.  It's dice on ice.  Yeah, I was a little disappointed with my performance.  I pulled off the quad.  And then I go into the triple saw cow.  I can only pull off a double.  But I hit the toe loop.  I hit it.  So I'm scared.  Hey, guys, what do you think of my, I went with the gold lame.  I see that dice. 
[00:06:30]  I was going to go with the silver, but it was a little tacky.  We're watching your performance right now.  It looks good.  You're skating backwards right here.  I'm very proud of this move.  Yeah.  See, it comes up.  I do the spin thing.  Whoa, hey.  And now look, I jumped over there, but look where I land.  I'm over here now.  I jump over there.  I land over here now.  But there I am.  Now I'm twirling.  I'm very dainty on the ice.  Most people say I'm a big guy.  I'm dainty on the ice.  It brings out my feminine side. 
[00:07:00]  Look at you reaching for the sun right here.  And now I'm reaching, reaching.  Nice, nice.  And here I go.  Yeah.  Now I go down into the low leg grab spin.  And look at my head.  My head's flying like when, I call this the head, the dice camel.  Uh-oh.  It was the hamlet camel, but now it's mine.  Look at you flying around the ice now.  Now look, I got some speed up.  I see that.  I go all the way from over there to over here now.  Now I'm in front of the judges.  There's one quad, a triple, and a triple. 
[00:07:30]  Oh!  Oh!  I pulled that off.  Oh!  Bop!  So I'm skating, right?  Yeah.  And this fag wants to put his tongue up my...  Oh!  Now I'm going, look at me backwards.  Look, I'm skating backwards.  Look at my head.  And the costume's good.  I wear a lame leather jacket with dice bedazzled on the back.  Oh!  Well, it's a little weird with the sweatpants, though, Dice. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, well, the sweatpants help.  It helps with the atrodynamics.  Oh, you're slowing it down, though.  Now I slow it down.  Here's where I get dramatic.  Okay, very.  Here I...  Now I'm going for another jump.  I hit that one.  Oh!  The quad!  And now a toe loop.  And now I grab my foot and spin on the ice.  Look at this.  Look at my hair.  I'm handsome out there.  What?  Do they score for handsome?  Oh, they should. 
[00:08:30]  Now I do something no one else does.  What's that?  I bring midgets out on the ice with me.  Watch me jump the midget.  Oh!  Look at that.  Now I look.  I put my leg on top of the midget.  And he's skating like he's my leg.  I bent it to the...  Oh, here we go.  Now I go into an Italian thing.  It's the tarantula song.  Look, look. 
[00:09:00]  I'm skipping on the ice.  You can barely tell I'm wearing skates.  You're running on your toes, I see.  Yeah, the other skaters in the back, they go,  Oh, dice.  Why do you have to be so good at skating?  I go, take the sea out of your way.  Faggot.  Ow!  Now I'm passing by the judges.  A toe loop.  A spin.  Give me a perfect score. 
[00:09:30]  Bump the gold medal spine.  Oh, here we go.  Oh, bravo.  Nice finish.  Thank you.  See how I drew my hands up in the air?  Very nice.  That's dainty.  Now wait, I gotta wait for my scores.  You went down on one knee there.  Very nice.  All right.  Look, instead of the stuffed animal, what am I holding?  A midget.  It's in my lap.  A midget.  I wait for my scores.  Uh-huh.  6-0, 6-0.  Nice wins.  Oh! 
[00:10:00]  No controversy there.  The French judge screws me.  I'm gonna plow.  Hey, French judge, suck my banana juice.  It's dice on ice.  I like the dice on ice.  Very good.  Oh!  I'm having trouble with the quad.  Hey, Club Soda Kenny, collect my roses, okay?  Hey, happy face, get my roses. 
[00:10:30]  The people love me.  Out on the ice.  Hey, Timothy Gay, boy.  What's with the hair?  What's with the moosey curly hair?  He don't skate like me.  I'm the best.  And I'm handsome.  See the guy that looks like the lead singer of Def Leppard?  That's the blonde guy.  Hey, blondie.  You know one thing?  He skates backwards.  The hair looks beautiful. 
[00:11:00]  It's beautiful.  Oh!  I skate unbelievable.  I get the gold medal.  M-bop!  Look at my ass in this outfit.  It's gorgeous.  I like the tight ass on it.  I leave the legs loose so I can do my jumps.  And the choreography's gorgeous.  I learned that at Pips when I used to play there in Brooklyn.  Dice, someone wants to know if you're gonna consider hair skating.  What, with like a chick? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, or maybe a little of that ice dance.  What, do I lay it down and put my yam bag in her face?  Oh!  Score me!  I win!  Bop!  And now the finishing move.  Mule juice on the face.  Pinch the helmet.  Pinch the helmet.  Soak I win!  Oh!  Get me another broad.  This one's full of goo.  She can't skate with goo in her eyes.  I banana juiced her eyes shut. 
[00:12:00]  She's skating into the walls.  She looks like a retard.  Oh!  People ask, I dice.  What are you gonna do after the Olympics?  I'm gonna go pro.  You're going pro?  I'm skating around for money.  Yeah.  I got something I got.  I'm working on a thing.  Yeah.  You know the thing?  You're gonna help me with the thing?  Are you talking about Dice-capades?  The Dice-capades!  Like, look at me.  I'm skating with Snoopy.  It's crazy.  Here comes Charlie Brown.  Look, I'm in the case of Beauty and the Beast. 
[00:12:30]  Hey, Beauty!  Dump the Beast!  I'll dump a load of goo on you!  Hey!  Dice-capades!  Now it's mine!  Matt has a question for you.  Dice on Ice.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, I want to know if Dice is gonna be the first person in an international competition  to pull up the quadruple plow cow.  Ah, nah, nah.  You're not stealing that from me.  People do the sow cow.  No.  I do the plow cow.  I bring a fat, disgusting pig on the ice, and I plow her on her back. 
[00:13:00]  The judges love that kind of thing.  I'm just plowing a smack in a fat cans as I gently go down the ice.  People go dice.  How are you so dainty while you're banging this fat slob?  Yo!  You got some other moves there, Dice, or what?  Nah, I like the quad.  That's good.  And the toe loop.  Yeah.  That's a fun one.  And then I got a new one. 
[00:13:30]  What's that?  It's called the triple boogaloo.  I jump.  It's like a quad.  But as I jump, I go boogaloo-galoo, boogaloo-galoo, boogaloo-galoo.  I'm over here now.  And when I land, I'm over here now.  I started over there.  I land boogaloo-galoo.  I'm over here now.  Ow!  Can he...  Get my flowers.  Why is this full of so many faggots?  Everywhere I turn, another fag. 
[00:14:00]  So catch dice on ice in the dice capades.  And then my big finish after the boogaloo-galoo?  Yeah.  It's to look what I did to you again.  Ow!  Pinch the mule, pinch the mule, pinch the mule.  And then the banana juice out of my yambag.  So much, they got to bring out the Zamboni to clear the ice.  Goo all over.  You know that move where you stop short and the ice goes flying on your skates? 
[00:14:30]  Sure.  I do that in front of the judges with my yambag juice.  They're covered.  The French judge, like she's covered in strudel.  Ow!  You love it, you pig whore!  All right, dice.

[00:31:30]  Obviously somebody told him  You know then  When Anthony did dice on ice  Originally last week  We got so much email  From all over the country  Thinking that it was really dice  People thought it was dice  Yeah  People actually think it was dice  And now they're really confused  Cause then dice calls up  And does dice on ice  A little bit  When we first started  Here in New York  And I would  I would do the dice voice  People thought dice  Was in the studio  All the time  And we had him  As the guy that used to  Clean up and take the garbage out  Yeah  I was like oh here comes dice  You remember Andrew dice clay 
[00:32:00]  Well he's working here now  And he's cleaning up  And he'd come in  And  Where are the garbage pails  I clean up the garbage  And I sweep now  And people actually  Called up and would talk  To dice  That's hilarious  My first time hearing about you guys  I was obviously working with Andrew  And Club Soda Kenny called me  There's two guys in New York  That do an impression of Andrew  Andrew  And I was really prepared  And I'm gonna beat you  Oh real  Oh yeah I'm real  I'm like  Because he's my friend man  I'm like you guys are  Torn on my friend  I'm not gonna like them 
[00:32:30]  And then the first time  I listened to the show  You're doing Tyson  And Empire State Building references  I'm like oh  That's what won you over  Oh yeah of course  All right on  Nick what's going on  Hey I just want to tell Rick  Isolate that whole phone call  Yeah right  Every time dice calls  It's like a whole new sound board  Yeah  Alright peace out  The Opie and Anthony show  I guess we can mention McCain 
[00:33:00]  Yeah that's an interesting little tidbit in the paper today  John McCain  Wow I saw the footage on TV  What is  Is he nuts or what  John McCain  We all know the story  He's an American hero  He was tortured  At the Hanoi Hilton  Right  Right  Over there in Vietnam  North Vietnamese  Had him a prisoner  And everyone doing stories  Because it's been 25 years  So what does McCain decide to do  He decides to go back to Vietnam  What is he nuts  Not only back to Vietnam  Back to the same cell 
[00:33:30]  That he was held in  In the POW camp  That's like going back to a bad marriage  Years after you get a divorce  Yeah right  Why would you do it  Why put yourself through the agony  Why would you do that  He flies halfway around the world  To probably get depressed  The cell he was in  Where he was beaten  Tied up  Bottom of his feet  Smacked with bamboo shoots  With bamboo  And his shoulders broken  His face pummeled  And he goes back  He goes back  Like you're visiting your old neighborhood 
[00:34:00]  When you get a new car or something  When you're a kid  You get your first car  What do you do  You drive around your old neighborhood  To show it off  Right  What is he showing off though  Well he brought his son I guess  His son Jack  Thirteen  His son in the picture in the paper  Was walking in the cell  Like oh Jesus  No wonder dad's such a son of a bitch  Right  You know  Oh he had to stay in here  Oh  Yeah dad  Thanks for locking me in my room  Gee I think you'd understand now  So you think John McCain was in his old cell  And just kind of sitting there  And reflecting a little bit  Son 
[00:34:30]  Son  Son this is where I stayed  For many years in the war  I remember  Being in this very cell  When the gooks came in  That's what we called them son  The gooks  They'd come in and smash me in the face  Yeah what did I smuggle in here  In my pocket  Hey  Hey Mr. Vietnamese guy  Take that  Gooks  Take it gooks  You sons of bitches 
[00:35:00]  Slanty eyes  Yellow gooks  Help me begin  Cover me sons  I'm going to take the short one  Stay in there  The yellow one behind the rock  I'll take you back  You bastards  Oh look  Gook baby  Gook baby  Watch out for the gook  He could have a grenade  Gook women

[00:36:00]  I wouldn't go back there  Wow  Okay  I almost felt like I was there  Alfie  That's a haunting tribute song you played for his return to Vietnam  Well  Well this actually is the song they used in that Columbine video which is just a twisted thing going on in Colorado 
[00:36:30]  Did you hear about this one?  Yeah they took this song and put it on a video of the scene of the massacre  Yes  Yes  So they got footage of the library that is just  I mean it just looked  Oh my god  Who  Who's putting this video out?  What the fire department or something?  They're selling copies for 25 bucks  They got like the video of the library where there's bloodstains and books and just everything shattered all over the place  And this song is playing in the background 
[00:37:00]  Yeah that's pretty bad  And then they got like some mom was really outraged  She was on TV  Yeah  Because in the video I guess they have somebody dragging her daughter's body across the lawn  To the video and on the video to this music?  Yes  Oh see that's kind of like 
[00:37:30]  Ugh  And for $25 anyone can buy a video showing an empty bullet riddled Columbine high school after the massacre a year ago  And the footage comes with a pop music soundtrack  Welcome to the bottomless pit of ignorance  Opie  I feel like being an idiot  Anthony  I'm a retard

Great.  So, I feel bad for Jay's girl, I'll tell you.  Well, for Jay.  My ex-girlfriend didn't call me at all when she was away.  Dirty pig.  I don't know, man.  I tell you, she came back though. 
[01:00:30]  It was terrible.  It was like throwing a hot dog down a hallway.  It's really a bad thing, I think, once they get down there.  Have a good one, guys.  See, this is what we didn't want to hear.  Now the ladies are calling.  Tammy is going to crush all of us.  Tammy, what's going on?  Say it.  Go ahead, Tammy.  Say it.  Say it.  It's true. 
[01:01:00]  What?  It's true.  What's true?  Wait, hold on a second.  What's true?  What is she doing?  Tammy, what are you working?  No, no.  I was at the gas station and they asked me to turn my car off.  What's longer?  The guy's schlongs in Jamaica or the gas hose coming out of the pump?  It's not just the way.  Oh, yeah?  Well, what do you want to say?  Yeah, what do you want to say?  We're doing a radio show here. 
[01:01:30]  Tammy.  If they're going to Jamaica, I'm going to come back.  I think she's been bludgeoned with a Jamaican member over her head.  And she's a little slow now.  There's a bunch of dents in her brain.  Man, help us out.  Going to Jamaica.  And how does a girl talk her boyfriend into going to Jamaica alone?  It's like, could you go to your girlfriend and go,  yeah, well, I'm just going to go visit like a whorehouse in Vegas.  Yeah, and I got all these free coupons. 
[01:02:00]  And I'll just go there.  Later.  Chris from the Bronx wants Jamaican Mike to say,  look what I did to you again.  With that accent of his.  Mike, you have to say that for us.  To say, look what I did to you again.  Look what I did to you again.  Yeah, I'm on.  Mary, what's going on?  I'm calling in about the fact that the Jamaicans, 
[01:02:30]  the man that called in earlier that said that his fiance is down there  and she's calling him.  Better watch out, because I live with the Jamaicans.  And that little stereotype about the big thing, it's true.  It's true.  Oh, yeah.  My boyfriend is from Cholani.  Cholani?  I'm from St. Thomas.  Okay.  St. Thomas.  Between Portland and Kingston.  Right.  He's got family there as well.  They measure distance in penis over there.  So that's like what, 25 penis away? 
[01:03:00]  Something like that?  Wow.  All right.  And Mary, he just pounds you and pounds you.  He takes care of it every night.  Mary, how huge is it?  Is it like a shopping bag now?  Can you remember when it was the size of a normal private area?  No.  No.  Seven years.  Hi, Junior. 
[01:03:30]  Seven years, you know, he takes care of it.  That's all that fits.  Does it give you acid reflux from hitting your stomach?  It's like an old man's mouth when he pops his teeth out.  Oh, God.  Oh, man.  Do you walk like you have a rash?  All the time?  No.  No?  You get used to it after a while, but I'm not going nowhere else.  But that's it.  You can't...  There's no turning back now. 
[01:04:00]  You've set the bar at a certain level and it's over.  When you're naked and you're walking around your house, does it sound like you're wearing corduroys?  No, it's fine, but he takes care of it and well.  Jamaican?  Yeah.  When you get into the bathtub, does the water level go down? 
[01:04:30]  Well, I love you.  You guys are great.  He got me into listening to you.  All right.  You rule.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  That's something.  We're breaking some ground here.  Finding out Jamaicans have really big ones.  Geez.  Sarah.  Yeah.  Hey, how are you?  Very good.  How are you guys?  We're doing all right.  You guys are the greatest.  You make my drive home the greatest.  Thank you.  When I was down in Jamaica, they have lots of wooden statues with these large Jamaican 
[01:05:00]  junks, if you will.  Really?  They call it the big bamboo.  And they have shirts that say, who's afraid of the bamboo?  That's how you get used to looking at it on a statue before you have to see the real  thing, I'm sure.  Exactly.  If you want to try it out, you get back into it.  It's the plunger thing all over again.  Oh, man.  So, did you have any of that Jamaican sex down there?  No, I didn't.  I was 12, but a lot of Jamaicans were interested in me.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:30]  Oh.  Okay.  Terrific.  Have a great day, guys.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  Let's go to Brad.  Hot and huge penises.  Why would girls come back?  Why do they come back?  Yeah.  Why do they come back, Mike?  That's like a strip club that gives away free beer and never closes.  Right.  Why would the guy leave?  Brad.  ONA, what's up, guys?  How are you?  How are you doing, Jamaican Mike?  I'm doing pretty good.  You?  I'm doing all right.  All right. 
[01:06:00]  I got this ridiculous story.  I better be careful how I tell it to be on the radio, but you hear it.  Yeah.  All right.  So, a friend of mine, he's a close friend of mine.  He went down to Jamaica for spring break this year.  And he went into this bar and they were actually having, what's the best way to put this,  just random girls at the bar.  They were having an oral contest.  How's that?  Whoa.  What was I wrong, please?  Like a Hummer contest?  Absolutely.  So, girls that were just at the bar were giving Hummers to guys? 
[01:06:30]  He said basically it were a bunch of random guys they had lined up there and they were  just picking out of these just drunk girls that were just at the bar.  And they all, you know, got down and all at the same time started.  And whoever could get the guy first got like prizes and drinks and stuff like that.  He said it was pretty unbelievable.  Yeah.  Keep going, baby.  Keep going. 
[01:07:00]  Keep going.  I'm almost there.  It's all good, though.  It's all good.  All right, Brad.  Take care.  Thank you.  Let's go there.  Johnny, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's going on?  How are you?  I got a funny Jamaican story for you.  I had no idea what Jamaica was all about.  The men's units down there were huge.  Ten years ago, get married, right?  My wife and I, we were only with each other before this.  We were two virgins on our honeymoon.  We got down there.  Oh. 
[01:07:30]  And, you know, you go to the club med scene or the hotel down there and you stay kind of  by yourself.  Well, one night we decided to venture out to go to the local scene to kind of catch out  what's going on.  Biggest mistake ever.  What happened?  We go to this luau, this type of thing where, like, all the local guys are there.  We're hanging around a bonfire, eating and drinking.  And all of a sudden, my wife starts dancing with one of these guys.  And this guy started sporting wood, if you know what I'm saying.  Oh, my God.  Dude, that thing could have covered half of DC.  It was like an umbrella. 
[01:08:00]  It was like an umbrella in the shade.  Ever since then, man.  Ever since then.  Excuse me, dude.  Can we see your stuff?  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Torture!  Hence torture! 
[01:08:30]  Wow.  So what happened, Johnny?  So, I'm sitting there in amazement.  And her eyes are like the snake from Jungle Book.  You know what I mean?  That snake where the eyes are all googly-eyed and she's just, like, staring at that thing.  Dude, it has never been the same.  Ten years later, it has never been the same. 
[01:09:00]  She looks like bananas different now.  Oh, yeah?  Stick it in my mouth!  Of course, talking about the joints in Jamaica.  Ouch!  I never sized up since then.  Yeah.  Wow.  I just have to thank, you know, the Jamaican men for ruining it for the rest of us small white men.  Thanks a lot, Mike.  All right.  Take care.  Bye, Johnny.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  Oh, my God. 
[01:09:30]  That's awful.  That was on the nachos.  That was hilarious.  The girl, the snake from Jungle Book.  The eyes getting big.  She's just looking at that.  Wow.  That's horrible.  Her face was like those wacky paintings you see in the subway where the girls have the big, huge eyes.  Aw.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  How are you doing?  All right, I got a story for you.  I was down in Jamaica for spring break about two months ago.  All right, I'm at this bar. 
[01:10:00]  First of all, these guys, these local guys are cool.  But they, you know, they go, they flock to the bars and they just, you know, will stand around all cool in the back of the bar with, like, the joints behind her.  There's plane loads of white chicks coming in.  I mean, why wouldn't you want to go to the bars?  Here comes another one, man.  We go out, I see the hottest white girl I've ever seen.  All right?  I see her.  I don't have the courage to go talk to her.  Finally, like, on the third night, I got a couple of red stripes with me.  I'm going to go and talk to her.  I see her in the corner of the bar hooking up with this Rastafarian guy, this Jamaican guy. 
[01:10:30]  She's rubbing his junk.  She's all over this guy.  And I am just heartbroken.  And my confidence the entire week just went down the tubes, man.  It was traumatic.  You could forget about it, man.  Yeah, here's you.  Exactly.  Hey, Jamaican, Mikey.  And there she is.  I need that comparison again. 
[01:11:00]  That's too good.  The white guy.  White guy in Jamaica.  And the guy that she was with at the bar.  Anthony.  Yo.  How are you?  I was down in Jamaica a couple of weeks ago.  Yeah.  And there I am.  I hook up with these two girls.  And I meet one of the guys from the entertainment guy of the resort I was at.  Uh-huh.  And we end up going back to their room, you know, having some fun with the girls. 
[01:11:30]  And there's a camera come out.  Oh, yeah?  Biggest thing I have ever seen.  And like a sleeping Doberman, you know, when they wake up and they just get up.  The damn thing just stood up and looked at me.  I said, oh, my God.  I had to get the hell out of there.  I lost it.  I just walked out of the room. 
[01:12:00]  See you later, precious.  Oh, my God.  Darren, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  How you doing?  We're doing all right.  Yeah, I got a friend who's a waiter.  And he's got a buddy at work.  Jamaican guy.  He's got into a contest in this country for the biggest penis. 
[01:12:30]  They have these contests down there in Little Village.  And guess what, guys?  He came in third place.  What?  Oh, man.  I mean, if I go down there, I'll have to enter the women's competition.  And I'll probably lose.  Same, guys.  Terrible.  Take care. 
[01:13:00]  You're the loser.  Damn.  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Junkzilla.  Junkzilla.  Ed, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  You're going to make me drive off the road.  I'm down in Jamaica at one of these all-inclusive resorts.  And they have this guy, the body man, who took us all on a picnic. 
[01:13:30]  There were five guys.  A picnic man.  Yeah, a picnic.  Or so we thought.  A picnic.  There were five white guys, five white girls, and the body man.  The body man.  He takes us out into the ocean into, like, thigh-deep water.  And we start in these drinking games with rum punch and everything.  Yeah.  Well, one thing leads to another, and everybody starts to get naked.  And, of course, what happens when white guys go in the ocean? 
[01:14:00]  They get the turtle head.  So there are five of us standing there.  I've never been more humiliated in my life.  He takes down his shorts.  He takes down a line of women waiting to get it on with him.  And the rest of us are standing there drinking rum punch.  That's great, man.  That's great.  Why the hell would you be all down there?  Why would you take off your trunks, let's say, if you know you have a turtle head? 
[01:14:30]  Biggest mistake of my life.  He said if you wanted to stay there, you had to take your shorts off.  Oh, yeah, sure.  It eliminates the competition.  Exactly.  That's their plan.  They get whitey down there, and they take advantage of them.  You really hate them, man.  I'm hot in.  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[01:15:00]  God damn, you guys are hilarious.  That is awful.  Um, Mark.  Hey, dude.  Hey.  Oh, man.  I went into the CVS like two weeks ago, and they said, oh, hey, your wife's got pictures.  Do you want to pick them up?  I said, yeah, sure.  What the heck?  She was down in Jamaica.  I'm coming.  I'm in the car, man.  She's down there with her girlfriend.  I got pictures of her, her girlfriend, and Long Dong Silver laying in the bed.  Oh, laying in the bed?  Yeah.  And I'm like, what the hell am I going to do with this now? 
[01:15:30]  You know what I mean?  Oh, man.  I pulled the picture out.  She hasn't said anything.  I don't even know.  And I said, okay, fine.  Who took the damn picture?  You guys are killing us.  You guys are killing us, man.  Maybe they had the camera set up on a tripod and he just hit it with his slung.  I think he was holding it with the end of his slung because I couldn't see the tip of it.  Wow.  That's funny, Mark.  Oh, dude, man.  It's the Jamaican Heart Lonely Club today.  You're killing us. 
[01:16:00]  All right, Mark.  Thank you.  God bless you, man.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Yeah, man.  Louis.  Hey.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up, Louis?  Hey, man.  I'm going to go.  And she's telling me that I'm the first white guy she's ever had, right?  Yeah.  Think that I'm good and stuff.  And I work it out and it's all ready.  I'm ready to go.  And she says, wait a minute.  You need some Viagra?  I got some Viagra in the back.  I'm like, what do you mean, Viagra?  I'm like, this is me, man. 
[01:16:30]  What are you talking about?  She's like, no, no.  I got some Viagra.  Hold on.  Not so, man.  All right.  All right.  You guys do, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, man.  This is too far today.  It's awful.  Hey, Rod.  Yeah, guys.  What's happening?  How are you?  All right.  I'm doing good.  Hey, let me tell you something.  I was taking my girl down to Florida in a couple of weeks and I figured I'd give her  a little special surprise to go over to Jamaica.  So I was going to go get the tickets this weekend. 
[01:17:00]  Let me tell you something.  I got one thing to say to you, Tracy, because I know you're listening.  Disneyland.  We're going to Disneyland.  You are not getting unleashed in the land of the Caribbean Cyclops.  There's a shot.  There you go.  It's not happening.  Orlando, man.  That's it.  You are staying continental, baby.  Don't be scared, man.  Don't be scared.  I still love you, but you know, we just got to make sure we keep hold of what we've  got.  Don't be scared.  All right, Rod.  All right, guys. 
[01:17:30]  Be good.  Bye.  What we're going to get is Pirates of the Caribbean.  Disneyland.  Disneyland.  Disneyland.  And unlike Disney, it's not a small world in Jamaica, man.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's great, man.  That's horrible, man.  That's horrible, man.  That's horrible, man.  Oh.  Why would a guy go down there?  Why would a crazy white boy go down to Jamaica? 
[01:18:00]  Oh, this guy.  To Jamaica.  And look at this clip.  I've seen this clip.  Oh, what's the...  Oh, what's the...  Oh, the guy that lifts stuff with his schlong.  Yeah.  The guy looks weak.  I mean, I can understand that you're a single guy, maybe.  You want to go down there and smoke more pot than you've ever smoked in your life.  That's one thing.  But if you've got a chick and you go down there, you're insane.  Or if you let your chick go down there alone or with one of her girlfriends, like that's 
[01:18:30]  going to help.  Oh, she'll go with a girlfriend.  They'll protect each other.  No.  Skewered like shish kebab, the two of them.  Like a piece of beef and a pepper on a skewer.  That's it, man.  Quick break and we'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And this one's for the kids.  The kids out there.  Yeah, because you guys know that I do a lot of elementary schools.  I do. 
[01:19:00]  I like to come in and sing some cute little songs to the kids.  Oh, great.  Sure.  You and Barney.  One thing I feel is that I really need to stress to the kids that they can be anything  they want when they grow up.  And I tell them, no, I'm serious.  They can be doctors or lawyers or whatever.  And I say it's fun to use your imagination.  So I tell the kids that they can be a superhero if they want.  Oh, very nice.  Any kind of superhero they want.  Isn't that cute?  They can even make up their very own superheroes.  Okay.  So I play this.  This is for all the kids.  Seriously, if there's kids listening, it's just for them. 
[01:19:30]  This is really not for adults.  If I could be a superhero, I would be awesome man.  I'd fly around the world fighting crime according to my awesome plan.  And if I saw criminals trying to lie, hurting other people and making them cry.  I'd haul them off to jail in my awesome van.  Cause I would be awesome man. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Then I say kids, now you know.  We all know that when people offer you drugs and alcohol, like me, you just say no, right?  If I could be a superhero, I would be a drug free boy.  Telling the world of the evils of drugs and all of the lives they destroy.  Well, I take all the junkies getting so high with their needles and bongs and their sticks made of tie. 
[01:20:30]  As I burn them alive, I would squeal with joy.  Cause I would be drug free boy.  If I could be a superhero, I'd be immigration dude.  I'd send all the foreigners back to their homes for eating up all of our food. 
[01:21:00]  And taking our welfare and best jobs to boot.  Like landscaping, dishwashing, picking our fruit.  I'd pass a lot of laws to get rid of their brood.  Cause I'd be immigration dude.  I have the kids imagine what superhero they would be.  They could be any superhero.  If you could be a superhero, would you be justice guy?  Making sure people get what they deserve. 
[01:21:30]  Especially women who lie.  Like if a wife left her husband with three kids and no job.  To run off to f***ing white with some doctor named Bob.  You could skin them and drain them of blood so they'd die.  Especially Bob.  Then you would be justice guy.  Or you could be more subtle.  I didn't mean to be vague.  Give her the mad cow disease.  Let him die of the plague.  As long as they suffered for their horrible lie. 
[01:22:00]  Especially Bob.  Then you would be justice guy.  Yes, then you would be a superhero like me.  David Lynch!  There you go.  That one's for the kids.  I like that.  That's cute.  That one's for the kids, isn't it?  You could just picture them all running around like they're flying. 
[01:22:30]  Listening to the song.  With their cute little...  Little blankets.  Costumes on.  Yeah, a little cape.  A little cape.  Sure.  Maybe iron on some letters under their little picture.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony.  What do you think this show is?  It's a mix between curious amusements and outright horror.  It's absolutely disgusting.  It's awful.  Filth and smish.  It's really bad, but it's really good.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:23:00]  Truly tasteless and not funny.  N-E-W.  Opie and Anthony.  1-0-2-7.  W-N-E-W.  E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E.  What do you think this show member?  N-E-W.  Opie and Anthony.  Is she insane? Will she know?  Is she not right × she in and stay Now is she not right × she in and stay 
[01:23:30]  She knows  All right, Anthony.  Oh, we forgot about the biggest story of the day.  Yeah.  We're having so much fun today.  Yeah.  Ruben Rivera.  What an idiot.  You know, I read this today in the papers, and I can't believe this is true. 
[01:24:00]  I've known people like this, though.  They jeopardize something very good for something stupid.  But does he need the money that bad?  I guess he does.  I don't really get this.  He does.  If you haven't heard, great story coming out of Tampa.  It says there's no room in the Yankees' clubhouse for a thief.  Yeah.  A thief.  A thief.  So you're thinking thief.  Hmm.  Is it one of the ball boys? 
[01:24:30]  Uh-huh.  Maybe like the running coach?  Who's thieving?  Who's thieving?  Who's thieving?  That message was sent loud and clear to Ruben Rivera last night.  But Ruben Rivera, why would he be thieving?  When GM Brian Cashman released the outfielder, who was, according to multiple organizational  sources, caught stealing a glove from Derek Jeter late last week.  Oh.  He's stealing Derek Jeter's stuff.  Why?  The guy's making a good salary to be on the Yankees.  Because it's sports memorabilia, Opie. 
[01:25:00]  Very lucrative market for a Derek Jeter's glove.  You know?  That's twisted.  It says, even though Rivera returned the mitt to Jeter on Saturday, the damage was done.  Yeah.  There's no lower form of life in a big league clubhouse than a thief.  Who said that?  I don't know.  It says several items also disappeared from Roger Clemens' locker this spring.  Oh, boy.  The guy's going through everyone's lockers and stealing crap.  Oh. 
[01:25:30]  So, I guess the team voted.  Yeah.  And they unanimously decided that he has to go.  They voted him off the island?  They voted him off the island.  Who's going to win at the end?  I bet Clemens walks away with the whole thing.  I bet he wins.  Because who's getting voted off next?  I'm going with the old guy.  Yeah?  Don Zimmer.  Don Zimmer.  I'm going with Zimmer.  He'll be like Rudy.  As long as...  I don't know if there's any faggots on that Yankee team, but I don't want any near me. 
[01:26:00]  I was a Navy SEAL, and I didn't have to share no room with no faggot or queer.  Ready for this?  Rivera forfeits $1 million.  $1 million.  $1 million he's going to make.  And he's pilfering gloves to sell off to some sports memorabilia guy.  Yeah.  He's making deals.  Jeremy, what's going on?  Hey, I was checking out eBay for some of this stuff, guys. 
[01:26:30]  And I saw El Duque selling Jeter's hubcaps on there.  Ouch.  It's a complete set.  Well, that's...  So then Joe Torrey summoned a meeting late yesterday afternoon to help decide Ruben Rivera's fate.  Blah, blah, blah.  And everyone voted to kick him off the team.  And that's pretty much it.  He's a thief.  And they caught him.  I think if it was anyone else, maybe, someone a little more valuable, you think they would have, you know, gotten him some help and spun it that way. 
[01:27:00]  The guy's got a problem.  He needs some help.  And, you know, we stand behind him.  No, because it's either you're a scumbag that gets kicked off the team now, or you're a poor guy that needs a little help.  How do you show your face in the locker room after that, though?  I know.  Everyone's stolen away their gear.  Even if they said, hey, man, you can stay on the team, you gotta leave.  You gotta make jokes like sign your jockstrap and throw it at him, see what you can get for this.  You know?  Okay.  I'll do it.  Ruben, it's Don West.

[01:58:30]  Thing you've ever done  On this show  You know worse than  Dr. Smith  Two days ago  Dude  Dr. Smith  Two days ago  Nothing  Compared to what  You just did  Matt from Long Island  The most  Uncomfortable radio  I have ever  Heard  Holy ass  Funnier than  Kneecap cancer  From Skidmark  In Jersey  With a callback  West Coast  Dave disgusted  You're going to hell  You really are  He had still  Right after that  Jim what's up  Opie man  I gotta go to church  Just listening to that  Holy Christ

Your favorite comedian  My favorite comedian  Without a doubt  Man  Thank you  Funniest guy you'll ever see  In a club  Thank you so much man  And he works clean  So  Brian Regan  Be funny  Oh my god  Just kidding  Be funny now  Now  Be funny immediately  You know  It's like when you're  On a flight 
[02:03:00]  You know  I dread when the person  Next to you  Gets to that  What do you do for a living  Question  Oh yeah  Yeah  Cause you can either lie  And then you gotta back up  A lie  Which could be  Six hours of torture  I've backed up a lie  Before it sucks  You know  Or else you can tell the truth  Which is  As torturous  If not more  You know  Cause once you say  You know  You're a comedian  They just kinda look at you  They always like  Cock their head back  You know  It's always like  Well you know  Even if they don't say it  The attitude is  Well it's time to prove this  Comedy thing to me 
[02:03:30]  Start to comede  Prove it to me  Because I'm in the window seat  You know  Who are you  I had a guy  Talk to me one time  He had seen me perform  At Dangerfields  Here in New York  Years ago  And he's getting on a flight  And he recognized me  From that  He wasn't even sitting  Next to me  He was sitting behind me  You know how high  Those seats are  And the guy wanted  To have a conversation  With me for the whole flight  You know  Hey have you ever met  Rodney Dangerfield 
[02:04:00]  You know  He can see like  My eyebrows  Well you know  He does come into the club  Sometimes  What's he like  Can we stop talking  Can we stop talking  You gotta do that thing  Where you just kinda  Cock your head  And you still can't see him  I don't know why  You even bother  Turning your head a little bit  Are you enjoying  Looking at my hairline  Put the seat back  And crush his legs  It's like always  That one  You think it's the last question 
[02:04:30]  You know  There's like a little bit  Of a pause  Or oh man  Maybe we're done here  You know  Does he do time  When it comes in  To Dangerfields  Why don't you go  To Dangerfields  And find out  For yourself  And leave me the hell alone  Oh man  You were here  Like a while ago  When we first  And it's funny  That you're in here today  Because we were just  Having a little retrospective  On our career  Here at N.E.W  And we were here  For about  You were here  For about eight minutes  When I was here  True  When I was here 
[02:05:00]  I believe you were  Our first guest ever  On the show  In New York  Yeah  And you were part  Of every phone call  That would come in  And up and having  Yes  We're new here  At N.E.W  The new guys  Hi  How you doing  You suck  F you  Put on some Skinner  Shut up  Shut up  And play the music  Screw you  You suck  Hey Brian  You're really funny  Screw you  I'll be and Anthony  You suck  Play some tall  I know  I don't know  What it is about people  That just can't handle  Anything new  You know  Yeah 
[02:05:30]  It's like  We're new  We're the new  Radio guys  Here at this hour  You are not  What we are used to  Hello  I'm sitting here  And I'm used to something  And this is different  From that  So stop  The differentness  Isn't that right  Honey  She's nodding  Yes  Yeah  So we put up  With that  Which was really fun  Yeah  Things have drastically 
[02:06:00]  Changed Brian  We don't play  Any music anymore  No music  No  No  N.E.W  The rock of New York  We don't play music anymore  Oh no  Are you allowed to  You know  Just break in the song  Yourselves  Yeah  Yeah  I don't think we've done that  We had a clip of Opie  Singing yesterday  And it wasn't very attractive  Tell you the truth  And then people calling  That is not what we're used to  Please shut up  You normally don't do that  So don't do that  This is not what I'm used to 
[02:06:30]  This is different from  What my normal daily experience is  I like everything else in my life  That's Brian from a year and a half ago  Boys from the past  We have played that clip  Has to be a hundred times  Oh man  Has to be a hundred times  So no music  You guys just sit here  And talk about the day  Just yap  And trade stocks  Pretty much 
[02:07:00]  Yeah  We don't even talk about the day  Usually  No  Every once in a while  You realize the mic is on  You gotta come over  And say something  Sometimes an inadvertent curse  Goes out over  That's why they put us  Since you were here  We weren't even on a delay  When you were here  We are now on  I swear to God  I drive home  I listen to the show  That's how much of a delay  They have put us on now  About 40 seconds  Whoa  See uh  What did you say? 
[02:07:30]  See we're on a very long delay  Not only us  But there's a guy in a room  Down the hall  Swear to God  Who has two more buttons  I actually walk by that room  It's like a big giant round button  It's about three feet in diameter  And he just sits there  And hits it  He hits it  Every time he hears something bad  Coming through  It's a circus  So that's  Press the button  So that's what we've been up to  The past  Couple of years  What have you been doing?  Touring around  Being a funny man 
[02:08:00]  I want to curse  Yeah see it was fun  Wasn't it?  Yeah it was fun  I watched you do that  And I could  You know it just seemed like  Can I say  You never curse  No I don't  We'll give you a curse  Yeah go ahead  Opie get ready on the button  No but make it good  Yeah  If you're going to curse  Make it good  Because the three people on hold  Will hear  I just want to make sure  That they're on the button  Because  You can't be fined by the FCC  Damn  Whoa  Uh oh  I hope they got that 
[02:08:30]  I hope they got that  Because  You're out there man  Well  I feel bad  Because  You know  You guys would be the ones  Off the air  You know what I'm saying  If that were to slip through  Ah the electronic equipment  Never ever fails  That's the wonder  Of  Technology  I had a guy  I do work clean  I had a guy come up to me  After a show one time  I used the expression  Pissed off  I don't even know  If I can say that here  Oh yeah  You can say pissed off  Which I thought was  You know  Within the parameters 
[02:09:00]  Of cleanliness  And this guy came up  To me after the show  Just shaking his head no  Saying you know  I've always appreciated  The fact that you work clean  Oh my god  I brought my  My sister out  She likes clean comedy  And you had to say pissed off  That's a little much  I don't know what to do  You know  And I actually ended up  Taking it out of my act  You know  I was like man  I'm offending people  Left and right  With my language  You're crazy 
[02:09:30]  It's like showtime  At the Apollo  With you  I am out there  Riding the edge  Without a helmet  So  No more that language  If you come out  You're going to be hearing  That kind of talk  Doesn't work blue  No  I woke up the next day  After seeing you  And I couldn't breathe  My ribs hurt  I was laughing so hard  Thanks  He was beat up  After he left  That's what I was  Yeah I got hijacked  But  I was coughing  I was mad at your language  Or something 
[02:10:00]  And left the club  Beating everybody senseless  It was amazing  Did you hear what he said?  Pissed off  I gotta hit you now  I brought my favorite nun  And he uses that kind of language  Somebody's gonna pay  Is that what the case is  Now in the audience  Because a lot of comics  Don't work clean  So you must get  Everybody that can only  See clean comics  Bus loads of  Handicapped children  Nuns  What  I don't know why  They would need it to be clean  But  Yes you know how they 
[02:10:30]  Like clean comics  Actually I don't really  Promote the fact that  It's clean  Because you know  Then people think  It's like  You know  Religious  Yeah you know  That it's like  Really  Not too on a wholesome side  You know  And it's like  I like to think  What I do is  You know  I don't know  I don't want to  Pat myself on the back  I was gonna use the word  Good  But  Good  I'm self-serving  I think it's adequate  I'm good  That's what I tell clubs  To put it on the marquee 
[02:11:00]  Adequate comedy  He's good  Brian Regan  I'm good  Yeah like how they have  How they have reporters  And names of critics  That say how the act was  Just put Brian Regan  Brian Regan says  I'm good  Oh no  Make the retard face  Put it on a poster  And have it outside  The comedy clubs  I'm good  I'm gonna come out  As being cocky now  I hope they hit  The delay button  On that  You know  Oh cocky  No you still haven't  No good 
[02:11:30]  I don't want to be saying that  I'm alright  I guess  Adequate  Adequate  Adequate comedy  More than adequate  My god man  Anyway  You're trying to sell some  Seeds over here  They're probably  For the love of God  Caroline's listening  Go  Oh my god  He's saying  He's adequate  People are calling  To cancel  You know  We were gonna go  See that guy  But adequate  I mean  Is that worth  A Saturday night 
[02:12:00]  I was looking  I have someone  Coming in  That's a little  More mediocre  Is that adequate  Guy coming back  To town soon  I never felt  Such an adequate  Show  So you know  Hopefully people  You know  Do a little  Chuckling or whatever  Sure  They will  They certainly will  We had a whole  Discussion because of you  We played one of your  Tracks off your CD  Are you still selling  That CD anywhere  Because I had to  Order the damn thing  Yeah you can get it  On the internet  And stuff like that  And it's also  In certain 
[02:12:30]  You know like  Certain music stores  Yeah one of the  Funniest CDs  You'll ever hear  But there's an  Evil Knievel bit  On there that  Made us discuss  Evil Knievel  All afternoon long  Well we probably  Grew up around  The same time  So Evil Knievel  Was a huge thing  On TV  We had a discussion  Ryan  Who was cooler  Evil Knievel  Or his son Robbie  And we just figure  Robbie's a  I don't know  He's a puss  He doesn't jump  Like his father  Yeah  Because the father  Just didn't have shocks  He didn't have a ramp  Really  Computerized ramp 
[02:13:00]  So they know  Exactly the angle  Evil just set up  Some plywood  On a fence  And then flopped  On the concrete  For a while  I like the  The bales of hay  At the end  What kind of  Safety feature  Is like  Eight stacks  Of you know  Little squares  Of hay  Stacked up  At the end  You know  But they still do it  Robbie's still  Yeah like that's  Going to do some hay  When he went  Headlong into that  When he went  Over the Grand Canyon  He fell off  And don't worry 
[02:13:30]  He hit the hay  He's alright  Ladies and gentlemen  Pillow soft  Bales of hay  Stuff like  Concrete  They should take  The medians down  Off the Long Island Expressway  To just stack hay  Hay from here  All the way out  Did a tip of Long Island  Oh that track  The trailer  Cut me off  I did 80  Into the median  Thank God  It was hay  Honey are you  Nodding off  At the wheel  Sweetie  What are you  Worried about  They got hay  It's all 
[02:14:00]  Stacked up  They're replacing  The airbag  Now a big  Bale of hay  Shoots out of  Your steering wheel  When you  Hit something  Well you know  What I think  Is weird too  About Robbie  Knievel  First of all  Robbie  I mean  That Grand Canyon  Thing  I saw it  Repeated the other  Night  That was pretty  You know  No parachute  The whole thing  Yeah  I don't know how  You know  I don't know how  Deep it was  You know  Maybe they picked  A part of the  Grand Canyon  That was like  Three feet deep  It's going to take  Another six billion  Years of water  Dripping  For it to be  Impressive 
[02:14:30]  When the Grand Canyon  Is completed  This would have  Really  Impressive jump  Yeah  I think it was  Deep in the whole  Nine yards  You know  But he still wears  His dad's clothes  When he jumps  That's what I think  That's a little weird  Yeah  You know  It's like that  70's red white and blue  You know  Leather outfit  Steve a Knievel  Outfit there  The superhero outfit  You know  What I think  I don't think  The whole daredevil  World is regulated  You know  There's no governing body 
[02:15:00]  So they're getting  Away with murder  I saw a motorcycle  Jump show  You know  Some daredevil show  And they said  This guy was going  To jump  I think it was like  30 stretch limousines  Yeah  And then they show  Those stretch limousines  And they're all lined up  Side by side  They're all touching  Each other  Who cares that they're  Stred  Aren't Volkswagen  Bugs about the same  Wind  You gotta be kidding me  What does that have  To do with anything  You know  I'm surprised  Some guy doesn't  Like attempt to jump  Like an entire 
[02:15:30]  Like Amtrak train  You know  But put the ramps  Up like on the side  On the side  You can do it  On a bicycle  Yeah  37 cars  Ladies and gentlemen  Either that  Or we need  A governing body  For the thrill seekers  Out there  There's gotta be a body  Alright  Let's take a  Break  And breathe  Our guest today  Brian Regan  We love Brian Regan  Look at the face  He may  Gee golly

[02:20:00]  Yeah  People going  What happened to him  That man  His behavior  It's different  Than what it was  So we are  Uncomfortable with that  I actually did that bit  On the CD  Which is very hard  Because the whole joke  Is completely visual  Right  So as I'm doing the CD  I had to  Try to explain  With the words  Like things that I would do  You know  Like that 
[02:20:30]  So you know  You're sitting there  Flailing and grabbing things up  I'm going  Oh man  This is way too wordy  I have another bit  You know  Where like I have to wave  You know  That the visual in the joke  Is me waving  And then as I'm doing it  For the CD  I realize  Nobody can see this  So I had to say  So you're just kind of  You know  Waving uncomfortably there  I hope this is playing  To the listeners  I just imagine  People listening to the CD  What the hell  Is this guy talking about  Pulling stuff off his body 
[02:21:00]  And awkwardly waving  I love the thing  That you do where  It's like  You too  You're the wrong thing  Yeah we love the you too  You too  We say that all the time  You must get that  All the time Brian  No  People coming up to you  It's a nice compliment  Thank you  Thank you Kristen  Thanks Kristen  God damn  That's funny  Thanks man  You know the  On the CD  They have  You know  You just do an hour  And then they just  You know  Put it together  It's seamless 
[02:21:30]  When you listen to it  Sure  But the producer  Wanted bit titles  I guess they can  Break it up  Into different bits  Even though when  You're listening  It doesn't fade out  And go into the next joke  So he needed like  Bit titles  And there was a  Deadline for him  So I was in an airport  Like on a  With a bank of pay phones  And I had like  This list of bit titles  You know  And there was like  A businessman to my right  And like this  You know  Woman standing on my left  And I'm on the phone  Going  Donut lady  Then stupid in school 
[02:22:00]  Then feeling lousy  You just wonder  What is this guy  Talking about  Who's he talking to  Do you still do  Donut lady in your act  Sometimes  I don't usually  Sometimes I do  I try to mix it up  Every show  You know  So it's a little bit  Different  Yeah  You know  Because I feel bad  For the  I feel bad  For the donut ladies  Because people  Can't make up their mind 
[02:22:30]  You know  When you go in there  I don't know  What it is about  Buying donuts  That make people  Freak out  You know  That they go in there  Okay  Okay  Alright  Okay  I  I want a dozen donuts  And  You got a lot of donuts  Okay  I'm going to start with  Four chocolate  I want  Two twisty goose  I want a lemon

[02:29:30]  Crack up in his face  And that kind of blew it  That's when I got the ticket  He just kind of went back  To his girlfriend  And said stay here  You got to learn  How to control yourself Frank  Especially when you get  The law in your face  That's very kind of you  Thanks  I used to watch you all time  When Comedy Central  Used to be good  And used to do  The stand up stand up  Oh my god  Now you know  You never get any  Good comedians on there  It's just one bad movie  After another  Way back when  You were on there  All the time  They do play the same 
[02:30:00]  Old movies over and over again  Thank you so much man  Thank you Frank  Where can I find a CD?  You can just go  Into different music stores  Or else you can go  On the internet  Do you have a web address  I could get it from?  I should have that  But I feel like  I'm living in the 1930s  Frank  I don't have an  Answering machine either  Really?

I have a computer  And all that  But I don't  Some people are funny  You can tell  They just have a website  Just for money  And someone else  Is running it completely  Because they come on  And try to plug it  It's like  Oh yeah  The world website  It's w.com  And then part of my name 
[02:31:00]  Is in there  But I couldn't get my whole name  So I had to put  Like a middle initial  The perfect example  Is Buddy Epson  And we talked to  Buddy Epson  Because well  I guess  And he got this  Huge write up  In the paper  About how she was  The last interview  And it was on  Howard's show  So we figured  We would call  Buddy Epson  Every day  Until he drops dead  So we would get  Some press  On having the last interview  And this son of a bitch  Is still alive  This is months ago  We gave up on the bitch  So we were calling him 
[02:31:30]  Every day  And it was really Buddy Epson  You know we had his home phone number  And he'd be like  Well Doggy  And we thought we had it  Because do we have the original  Well Doggy anywhere?  Do we have it on there?  You've got to hear this  Yeah this is pretty funny  We haven't done this in a while  We thought for sure  He was going to go  All right so  This is Well Doggy  About five years ago  Not even four?  Three years ago  Three really?  Yeah this is Buddy Epson  Three years ago  Well Doggy 
[02:32:00]  Now that's pretty good  That was over the phone  We called him  And he sounded  Perfectly healthy  One more time  If we can get the  Well Doggy  Wow  All right  Man  So now we call him  I guess a year ago  Not even  Not even  Eight months ago  And we asked him  To do the Well Doggy  And here it is  Well Doggy  Now we're seeing  A definite dip  In the health  Of Buddy Epson  Oh so maybe  Maybe you got  The last interview  Right there  This was it  Well Doggy 
[02:32:30]  Here it is  And here's the older one  Well Doggy  Well Doggy  Ouch  See  There's a distinct difference  And he's got a website  But he had no clue  What it even was  Like the guy's  A hundred and something  Years old  So he's like  W-W-Buddy  Come  W-W-Doggy  We  Mitchethro.bodine.granny 
[02:33:00]  I think when people  Tell you a web address  And they don't realize  How ridiculously long  And complicated it is  You know you don't have  A pen or a piece of paper  And they think  You're going to  It's  W-W-W-W-dot-Egghead-slash-9-7-star-blazer-at-earthlink-com-dot-w-web-net  Hey  Little squiggly thing  I'll check it out man 
[02:33:30]  That sounds  That sounds pretty cool  What was that after the W-W-W?  Yeah  Yeah you would think  They would just  Be able to make it easier  Like a phone number  You can reach anyone  In the country  On the phone  It's how many  God damn numbers  I know  Nine  Ten  What is it  Three  Seven  Eight  Nine  Ten numbers  I'm a moron  We have five in mind  But everybody has  A different kind of phone number

[02:35:00]  It's a little drive-thru thing  Where you get milk and eggs  And what not  Beer  They had  Drive-thru beer  And it's got a big silo  Next to it  Like they're working green  It's a big barn looking thing  With a silo  They have  And I grew up in Miami, Florida  They had farm stores down there  Which is the same kind of thing  You just pull up  And you shout your order  To the person  And they've got to  Scurry around and get it  Yep  And they go  $3.50  Out of  Yeah you're telling me  $5  And I like at the Dairy Barn 
[02:35:30]  When you want to buy beer  You have to get out of your car  For some reason  Yeah but I mean  What's the difference  If they hand it through the window  Or you get out  Grab it  And then get back into your car  Where you can do some safe drinking  From the privacy of your front seat  Yeah it is  It's some kind of wacky law  They can't hand the beer  Through the window  Alright you're going to have to  Get out into the back seat  And get out the window  On the right side  Come out  Crawl over the hood  And then you've got to  Take it one beer at a time  And you have to drink it  Under the car 
[02:36:00]  You have to open each one  And take a sip  And then you go back  Through the back rear window  Yeah I don't know what that's all  So what do you have for Brian today Mary  Oh well the last time I heard Brian  When he was on a few months ago  I was at Dairy Barn  I couldn't make my order  I was laughing so hard  And it happened again today  And it was stupid in school last time  And I would love to hear Brian  Do some of that  You were at Dairy Barn again today  I got it  What a coincidence  What is up with that  There's something going on
