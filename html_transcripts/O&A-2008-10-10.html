<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a segment focusing on comedian Jimmy Norton’s lawsuit with Roy Hollander, a lawyer who’d previously been a contentious guest.  Hollander’s $500,000 lawsuit stemmed from an earlier interview where Norton repeatedly called him a “phony” and made offensive jokes.  The hosts dissected the lawsuit's absurd claims and recounted details of the original interview, highlighting Hollander’s discussion of his hip-hop dance class and dating younger women. Listener calls contributed to the discussion.  This segment also touched upon a “Creepy Gay Kid” internet persona created by show staffer Sam and an upcoming Bret Hart interview.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about an attractive tattooed woman, followed by political commentary on the upcoming Presidential election, focusing on racial dynamics and John McCain's perceived weakness.  Audio clips of Jim Norton's appearances on Carson Daly's show were played. This led into an in-studio interview with Bret Hart. Hart discussed his career-ending injuries (including a concussion from Bill Goldberg and a subsequent stroke), the deaths of his brother Owen Hart and Chris Benoit, steroid use in wrestling, and his contentious relationship with Vince McMahon, culminating in a physical altercation. He promoted his autobiography, "Hitman."  Listener calls and additional host commentary concluded this segment.

Next, the show shifted to a discussion about Judaism, prompted by intern David's observance of Yom Kippur.  David's fasting and subsequent workplace confusion initiated a humorous, sometimes contentious, debate about Jewish tenets, with David frequently misrepresenting aspects of the religion.  Rabbi Jeff called in to correct him. The discussion encompassed comparisons between Jewish and Christian holidays and beliefs. David then delivered a humorless "Kosher Sports" report, which was poorly received. Anthony's family—his sister Dawn and father Sal—joined the studio. The conversation shifted to Sal's temporary conversion to Judaism, Anthony's childhood, and his mother's focus on her new grandchildren. The segment ended with calls, promotional announcements, and further family dynamic discussion.

The Saturday morning segment started with Anthony’s apprehension about fatherhood, fueled by childhood memories of his father.  Graphic discussions of breastfeeding and Dawn's breasts ensued.  Sal, a frequent caller, was a studio guest, and the conversation included his contentious relationship with his wife, encounters with women, technology struggles (including GPS and OnStar misuse), pill consumption, and emotional reaction to "Christmas Shoes." The hosts showed Sal the "Two Girls, One Cup" video, eliciting strong reactions.  Regular caller Patty also called in, contributing to the sexually explicit conversation. The stock market crash was a recurring, brief gag.

A lengthy conversation with a caller named Danny dominated the next segment. Danny expressed his dislike of Mexicans and duplexes, discussed past medical issues, and his sister's food pantry charity drive.  The hosts relentlessly teased him, and another "Danny" briefly promoted the food pantry. The conversation included tangents about Danny's dislike of Mexicans, a friend’s assault, and his childhood medical procedures. Mookie Wilson made a surprise appearance.  Intern David was criticized for his poorly prepared food pantry plug sheet. Sal joined later, receiving "Line of the Day."  The segment concluded with off-topic conversations, including a boat trip and Halloween plans, along with plugs for the hosts' projects.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And we're off.  All right.  That was good.  It seems like we were just going, oh, Monday.  Oh, it's Friday.  Going and going, doesn't it?  Yesterday was all about creepy gay kid.  Oh, wow.  And today it's going to be all about Norton getting sued.  Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy Norton.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thanks, guys. 
[00:00:30]  Yes.  Jimmy's been in L.A. for pretty much the whole week.  He comes back to find that some, in my opinion, douche is suing him.  Yeah, I was in the papers.  In the papers, in the papers.  Both the New York papers here at Daily News and The Post about how this lawyer that had  been on our show on the phone, he had a lawsuit. 
[00:01:00]  What was the initial lawsuit he had?  He was suing, I believe, because, you know.  It was ladies' night.  Yeah.  Right, right, right.  I think that's what he was suing for.  Clubs and bars for having ladies' night.  Ladies' night.  Because he thought it was...  Sexist.  Sexist.  Gender, I guess, exclusive.  Yeah.  I'm guessing.  And we had, we had, we were having a discussion with him about that.  Yeah.  And then we just wanted to know about other things he was involved in and his take on other, 
[00:01:30]  I don't know, social issues.  And he was called out, in Jimmy's opinion, as being a phony.  Yep.  And in our opinion, you know, the guy came across as, at least, you know, I'll say in  my humble opinion, as a hypocritical.  And he really took offense to that. 
[00:02:00]  And Jimmy, you know.  Well, the funny thing is we...  Started being the comedian he is.  Yeah.  It started out as a real interview, like, wow, we're, you know, this guy's suing, let's  get him on the phone.  And then, yeah, it turned ugly, because we were like, this guy is a...  Ugh.  Yeah, he had this...  And at first, we were on his side.  Completely.  Completely on his side.  He was able to actually turn us around and make us not like him. 
[00:02:30]  Within a half hour.  Yeah.  Man, you know how much I have to hate you for you to be suing an annoying woman's cause  and for me to fight you on it?  Yeah.  Exactly.  What a tool you have to be.  So, let's read this.  And Jimmy, you do what you feel like you could do, because you're being sued by this guy.  Yeah, I know.  He's a crack lawyer.  Yeah.  The headline in the Daily News, Lawyer Cries Foul.  I get it.  F-O-W-L, which is very key to this story. 
[00:03:00]  Yes.  You know, there's a lot of laughs in this article.  I gotta be honest, Jimmy.  It's one thing to hear it.  To sit here and hear it.  Yeah.  But then when you read some of these things in print, even funnier.  Suit claims Opie and Anthony co-host defamed him with chicken gag, comma, insults.  Yeah.  One vile insult apparently deserves another.  By the way, this Jose Martinez, who wrote this Daily News article, I have a couple of  small issues with.  All right.  I'll get to him. 
[00:03:30]  You jump in when you want to there, Jimmy.  Uh, so a Manhattan lawyer trashed on the Opie and Anthony show as a dumb bunch of lines.  A and a bunch of lines.  Is that for?  I don't know.  A, a bunch of lines.  So that would be.  Wouldn't it be A blank blank?  I don't know.  A-H they should have just put.  Yeah.  Oh, maybe it's that.  Okay.  It is that.  Oh, it is that.  Okay.  All right.  So, uh, so a Manhattan lawyer trashed on the Opie and Anthony show as a dumb, a, what 
[00:04:00]  can we say there at?  Uh, well, it would be, uh, a, um.  Dumb lawyer.  The A-H word.  Yeah, you know what it is.  It's where you expel, uh, food.  Yes, it's.  There you go.  Yeah.  All right.  We got it.  Who wants to have sex with chickens is suing the potty mouth comic who ripped him on  air, calling him a coward.  Well, uh, self-proclaimed anti-feminist Roy Hollander, who last year sued Columbia University  over a woman's studies program that, oh, that's what it was. 
[00:04:30]  Uh, yes.  Uh, the woman's studies program, right?  That demonizes men, filed the suit.  Oh, and then we had gotten into a discussion about other, uh, groups that have their own  studies programs.  Uh, he was so against the woman's study programs.  So we're like, well, what about schools that have exclusive black study programs?  And he thought that was fine and dandy and there was no problem with it.  And that's when we called him out as being a hypocrite. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Because if, if one group, uh, if he agrees that one group should have this, then why not  another?  Uh, and he wasn't, wasn't able to make a point as to why he was against the, uh, women having  their own study group, but blacks, uh, can have their own and everything is fine and dandy.  But, uh, the start as a legit interview.  Yeah.  I want to, I'm the one who wanted him on because I was actually, I like, this is why I just  hate this guy because I legitimately like the facts.  I think sometimes those study groups are, uh, men bashing. 
[00:05:30]  I was actually on his side.  That annoys me so much about this guy.  All right.  Um, it, it blasts celebrity hound, funny man, Jim Norton, celebrity hound.  I love that.  Like you're chasing celebrities.  Yeah.  What's with the adjectives?  Just, just right.  What are you doing?  Celebrity hound.  It sounds like, it sounds to me like he might be a listener and he, he's kind of throwing  these things in because it's funny.  It is funny to call you a celebrity hound. 
[00:06:00]  You're just running around with a Sharpie.  That's, that's accurate.  Could you please sign this, Bob?  He could have said it, it blasts boob, funny man.  Idiotic, funny man, irritating.  There's many words.  Of course.  It blasts celebrity hound, funny man, Jim Norton, an opium, Anthony co-host as a phony  and a loser who wastes much of his empty life trying to revolt people.  Can I please wonder, I have to see that if I've not seen this like paperwork, are those  words in the paperwork, is that actually in a legal document? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  If it is, I have to have that frame.  You got to.  If, if you're that upset that you, that you, you want to strike back, guys, I want  to be, if you need to be heard that badly that you have to insult somebody through a  lawsuit just because that gets your insults into the newspaper, like would you actually  in a legal document put, uh, that someone is a phony and a loser who wastes much of his 
[00:07:00]  empty life trying to revolt people?  Yeah.  He's assuming your life is empty.  Not even that bad of an assumption.  I mean, I pay for prostitutes.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  But why in the legal document, sweetie?  You might be able to countersue because, you know, and talking accusations here, my friend  and talking to this gentleman, talking to this gentleman on the phone, um, we started  delving a bit into his personal life and talk about empty and, and lonely and, and desperate. 
[00:07:30]  Uh, his, his, his dance, what was it?  He went to a, a hip hop class?  Yeah.  Hip hop dance class.  Hip hop dance class.  I think we got his MySpace and we're making fun of a lot of the stuff that he was into.  Oh, did we tease him?  Put it this way.  This guy, to me, is a creepy old guy trying to get young chicks.  And for me to say that?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  Yeah.  That, that is really saying something.  Uh, you're talking to Anthony, the substitute teacher. 
[00:08:00]  Call me.  Yeah.  Uh, let's continue.  So, the men tangled during Hollander's August appearance on the Opie and Anthony show on  XM Satellite Radio, where an interview about Hollander's beef with Columbia went X-rated  in a hurry.  I had never heard of Opie and Anthony, Hollander said.  I just went on there as if it were just another radio talk show.  Well, it is just another radio talk show.  Yes.  But I have, I have trouble believing that anyone who, who lives in New York who is, uh, hasn't  heard of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:08:30]  He heard of us.  Yeah.  He heard of us.  Well, he's a lawyer.  I mean, that's just, you know.  Yeah.  Lawyer.  That says enough right there.  Exactly.  Right.  Hopefully he'll wind up like other lawyers, like Johnny Cochran.  Old pudding head.  The lawyer says Norton defamed him in obscenity-laced tirade.  Hollander also said the star of HBO's comedy showcase, Down and Dirty, which is on Friday  nights at midnight on HBO, right after the Bill Maher show, which Jim Norton called him  a phony at least 10 times, 10 times and joked that the chicken crossed the road to avoid 
[00:09:00]  having sex with Hollander.  Do you know how great, do you know how great that is?  Thank you for putting that.  Right.  Of course it's fantastic.  Hence the, hence the headline, lawyer cries foul.  Yeah.  I called him a phony.  Yeah.  You're a phony.  Oh, you so got him on that one.  Wow.  Wow.  He must have been hurt.  Like, what a funny word to put in the paper.  Accused him of being a phony baloney.  A phony baloney.  Made fun of his dance classes.  I just love how the why did the chicken cross the road joke got in the paper. 
[00:09:30]  I know.  With a fantastic answer.  Of course it is, because it wanted to avoid having sex.  Like, first of all, if that was the truth, that's a legitimate reason for any chicken  to cross the road.  If a chicken is not sexually attracted to a human, why wouldn't it cross the road?  We're bigger than they are.  Tony, they're scared.  Of course they are.  What would you do if King Kong wanted to have sex with you?  You're crossing the road.  Hopefully to hide from it.  Poor chicken. 
[00:10:00]  Tony in California.  Yeah.  Hi, Tony.  Good morning, man.  Happy birthday, little kid.  No, no.  Come on.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Oh, get to the point.  Isn't this the same guy that challenged you to a duel somewhere down in a South American  country or something like that?  Yes, I believe this is the same man who, while we were arguing, said that it's legal to duel  in another country, so we should fly down and duel.  I believe it was Peru or somewhere.  Yeah, and he was dead serious.  He wanted to duel Jimmy in some country.  So basically what that's saying is, in the middle of this argument, which it all turned 
[00:10:30]  into was just a name-calling argument, that he thought it would be appropriate to fly somewhere  and get guns and one of us shoot each other dead.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That was his solution.  That's your solution.  Jimmy's solution is to use his comedic talents to bring a little fun sarcasm to the conversation,  and his was to shoot you dead.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah, that was your idea. 
[00:11:00]  Like, we should, like, my question was, would we go to the airport together?  Would we meet, like, I'm going to take JFK.  What flight are you taking?  I got the 830, but I don't think there's any aisle seats.  How about this?  You take the 8 o'clock, and I'll meet you down there.  You want to split a cab?  I mean, one of us is going to shoot the other to death in a duel.  You might as well split a hotel room, too.  Yeah, and look, does whoever shoots the other to death in the duel, do we call the next of  kin, or should we allow our friends to do it? 
[00:11:30]  What do you think?  Should you, right, should you get a two-way ticket?  Because you don't know who's flying back.  Should we fly first class?  Because those are refundable, and you figure, look, it might kill you.  You might as well, because one of us ain't coming back.  One of us ain't coming back.  One guy doesn't have to pay the bills, so.  Tad in Illinois had something.  Listen, the listeners know more about this story than we do, because it was just one of  those dumb things we did.  We do a lot of crazy stuff.  You were just another one in the long line of idiots we've had on the phone. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah, you're just a throwaway segment, but now the listeners have to help us out and  remind us of stuff.  This guy was going to say that, this guy set up the chicken joke because he goes, you're  a comedian, say something funny.  I believe that was true, which is just hilarious.  Yeah.  And I think it was a damn good one.  Oh, man.  It was a doozy.  It really was.  Oh, Lulu.  Now we know why this show is never a replay, because the boys behind the scenes were hinting,  eh, don't, eh, eh. 
[00:12:30]  So I guess something was going on behind the scenes that no one told us about.  Yeah.  Now this is a valuable segment to the open athlete community.  It's amazing to actually tie up the legal system with this crap.  Horse crap.  This is exactly what some of these lawyers, such as this gentleman, do that really give  lawyers a horrific name.  This is exactly what they do.  This is what I see as a frivolous lawsuit that's tying up court's resources so that real, authentic, 
[00:13:00]  legitimate cases have to be pushed back, have to be delayed.  The whole legal system's tied up because of lawyers like this gentleman, who was a little  personally insulted, and instead of taking it like a man, he has to bring it into the  courtroom to get attention for himself.  It's mind-boggling how, in an argument, where he actually was allowed to talk, it wasn't like 
[00:13:30]  we turned his leg down.  He was responding and I was responding.  Yes.  To drag the legal system into what amounted to two people arguing is mind-boggling.  Well, when I got the Google alert yesterday, I thought this was the onion or something.  I really thought this has to be a goof.  Yeah, but it's real.  Let's say hi to Dennis in Pennsylvania.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Go Phillies, by the way, Dennis.  Oh, boy.  I want to know.  Jimmy.  Yeah, I'm here. 
[00:14:00]  I want to know when tickets go on sale for your court appearances.  Ah.  Oh, nice.  Yeah.  I actually will be selling tickets for my court appearances in Boston, November 15th at  my Wilbur Theater show, the 945 show.  I don't know if it's sold out or not.  All right.  Let's continue here.  So, down and dirty, blah, blah, blah.  All right.  So, joke that the chicken crossed the road to avoid having sex with Hollander.  Here we go.  The half-million-dollar lawsuit slams Norton as a wealthy fraud masquerading as a man of 
[00:14:30]  the people.  First of all, I wish I was a wealthy fraud.  I do well.  But wealthy?  I don't know.  I don't think of what I make as wealthy.  Right.  You lost everything in the stock market the last three weeks.  Oh, I'm like taking a beating.  We all have.  About 70 Gs down already.  On safe stocks.  And that's as of October 1st at my statement.  I looked at my statement and I'm like, oh, my God. 
[00:15:00]  Only since October 1st?  No.  No.  Up to October.  Up until October 1st.  So, it still doesn't include, you know, from October 1st until now where it's really  taken a beating.  Right.  So, I don't even.  It's funny you opened up your statement because I got mine yesterday.  You ever get your statements and just not open them?  That's exactly what I did yesterday.  I don't want to look.  I don't know why you looked.  I got the statements from our guy and I just threw them in the shredder.  I swear to God.  I'm like, I don't want to look.  I can't even handle this.  I can't even handle this.  All right.  So, the half million dollar suit slams Norton as a wealthy fraud masquerading as a man of 
[00:15:30]  the people.  Wait, who runs around like I'm a man of the people?  You are a man of the people.  Maybe I think I am fairly.  Maybe I'm a man of the people.  I mean, look, I spend a lot of money on sex.  Yes.  I mean, what kind of a big shot does that?  Yeah.  I'm pretty much a man of the people.  You are.  You are a man of the people.  And I'm going to sue you for saying I'm a wealthy fraud.  I'm an almost wealthy pervert.  Get it right.  He's not a fraud.  You know, it's a new century here.  I think we got the trial of the century happening right in front of our eyes. 
[00:16:00]  Yep.  It said his alleged humor.  Alleged humor.  Centers on a 2000 event when he and other comedians were arrested for stuffing a Manhattan  bus with topless women to promote the Opie and Anthony show.  What?  That comes out of nowhere.  Wait.  The voyeur bus?  Jimmy was famous before the voyeur bus.  Wait.  But he said my humor.  For someone that never heard of the show.  Yeah.  He really dug eight years back into the voyeur bus incident. 
[00:16:30]  He googled your name, Jimmy.  But why would that all of a sudden be one of my humor centers?  This man's a silly goose.  Oh, yeah.  He certainly is.  Don't sue me for saying that.  It was just a Google.  He called me a ridiculous waterfowl.  No, it was a silly goose.  This guy has such a foul mouth, I'm beginning to think he uses his tongue to clean up toilets,  Hollander said.  This guy is funny.  And you know what?  You're not that far from the truth, kiddo.  Yeah, when I read that, I was like, well, he uses his mouth as a toilet. 
[00:17:00]  That's why a guy like that will sue.  This is right there in that statement.  That's his idea of a funny comeback.  Yeah.  And there's nothing worse.  And I hate to tell you this, kiddo.  I hate to tell you this if you're listening.  And you are listening.  I'm sure he's taping and listening.  Please tape away.  Yeah.  There's nothing worse than someone who's like a lawyer or some other profession, a doctor,  anything, trying to be funny and not being funny. 
[00:17:30]  And in this statement, he uses his tongue to clean up toilets.  That's how dirty his mouth is.  That's your idea of a funny...  How many times have you tried to be funny, whether it's at your hip-hop dance class or  other places, wherever it is.  Or at that bar you go to to try to score with the chicks that you were talking about.  And there's that awkward, uncomfortable silence where they're like, ugh.  Yeah.  Again, he tried to be funny.  That means you bombed.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  That's the thing.  You know the guy's listening.  Hollander, call up the dumb show, please.  Let's discuss this.  Norton did not respond to requests for comment.  They always do this.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  Whenever you get in trouble, they always say that they try to get a hold of you for comment.  It's BS.  Yeah.  But Jose didn't...  No one called us.  No one called you.  No one called our agent about this.  Nothing.  No.  We never hear anything.  The guy in the post who I'll get to, I have a problem with, or is it a girl, Dara, lied 
[00:18:30]  outright and said that I didn't respond to a phone call request, which is an out-and-out  lie.  That's just not the truth.  But they all do that, and there's no real way to prove it.  Except to say that's a lie.  They get away with that all the time.  Yeah.  Except to say it's a lie.  Oh, I know.  I know.  It's a long way to deal with it.  True.  The suit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court also calls Norton a celebrity suck-up who launched  into profane on-air rants against Yankee Captain Derek Jeter and KISS frontman Gene Simmons  because they wouldn't give him autographs. 
[00:19:00]  No.  See?  Again.  See?  This guy's just out-and-out a lie.  My tirade against Gene Simmons was because he wouldn't take a photo with me in Vegas when  I did it.  Right.  Please.  It's not about an autograph.  Get my childlike kicking and screaming straight.  Okay.  I kept reading it.  I did blast Derek Jeter.  Yes.  Of course.  Yeah.  I kept reading this yesterday going, this can't be real.  This is so silly.  This is in court.  This is in court.  Yeah, yeah.  Some judge has to deal with this.  This is the legal system has to be tangled up in this idiocy. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Some judge that could be better used doing something else, litigating some other, or officiating  over some other case, is now tied up with this garbage because this guy felt he was insulted  over on the phone.  When he's in the paper all the time, he's always bringing lawsuits.  Always.  And then you come on radio shows. 
[00:20:00]  I'm sure this isn't his first radio show.  I actually heard him on Tom Likas.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, it was a riveting interview.  Those two must have gotten along.  It was, so you say you like to.  Wow.  It was a terrific, riveting interview.  So the guy obviously is looking for publicity.  That's what he does.  That's why you go on a radio show, to get publicity for whatever you're doing.  Sure.  And then he doesn't like what we said or what Jimmy said to him or about him based on what  he said. 
[00:20:30]  Jimmy didn't just pull this out of his crack and start rambling on about things.  It was all based on what this guy was saying.  He didn't just, you know, you don't just pull out the guns and start blasting away.  This guy wound up saying things where it gave us enough rope to hang him with.  He was being, I don't know.  His whole discussion about how he went to the hip hop class and how he goes out to the 
[00:21:00]  bars and tries to get these chicks and stuff was just, ugh.  It was very laughable and very easy.  It was laughable.  Just picturing this guy that's way past his prime at a hip hop class.  This is coming from Anthony once again.  With all, please.  I'm certainly not past my prime, my friend.  Let me tell you that.  You're still rocking.  Of course I am.  But look at the picture of him right there.  Could you see that at a hip hop class?  And then we called him a hypocrite because he wouldn't, some groups are fine to have 
[00:21:30]  their own classes in school, their own groups, and others aren't.  He's a woman.  It comes across to me as a misogynistic woman hater.  Yes.  Yeah.  And what I said to him at one point in the beginning was that's what I was like, what  you said.  I was like, I hope that you're not just kind of like a caricature in the sense of it's  all about women.  Like, it's almost like if you're against any type of exclusionary behavior, or like 
[00:22:00]  whether it's based on gender or race or sexual orientation, anything that is completely for  a group is by nature to me exclusionary.  So that was what I was like, I kind of like the fact this guy is suing for those stupid  lady nights, because if you had a guy night, some feminists would sue.  Yeah.  But then it turns out he's all for racial preferences.  And then I think, I haven't heard the show since then it turned into like the hip hop class.  I'm like, oh, he's one of those guys who's trying to appease, I get it.  Right, right.  And that inconsistency annoyed me tremendously, because to me, that was hypocritical thinking. 
[00:22:30]  I think that was, that inconsistency bothered me.  We called him guilty white guy.  Yeah, from what I remember, yeah.  Because he's guilty white guy, he's at the hip hop class, he's, he's, and it might sound  funny for us to say, oh, this guy's misogynistic.  But anytime we do anything, it's humor based when we go in that direction.  This guy just, from his conversation over the phone, I found, you know, that he came 
[00:23:00]  across as somebody that just legitimately doesn't like women.  Didn't he have, there was a situation with a wife where he got burned or something.  And that's what I think where I really started to dislike him was when we talked about domestic  violence.  And he was implying that it was, it was very even, I don't remember to be honest with you.  Yeah, that as many, as many men get beaten by their women, and it's like, where do you  come up with that stat?  Or listen, we're really late for a break.  Let's at least get, no, let's get the rest of this article in, and then we'll take a break  and get into the post and the phone calls. 
[00:23:30]  It's, it's crazy.  The Insult Comics website, eatabullet.com.  You should hire this guy to help you out.  You should hire this guy as your publicist.  He's doing more than your publicist is doing.  Features photos of Norton posing with rappers, rockers, actors, jocks, and porn stars.  The comedian has been a co-host of the raunchy morning radio show since 2002.  We were off the air in 2002.  Well, I guess, yeah, part of it.  Okay.  And is known for irritating celebrity guests by screaming on the air. 
[00:24:00]  Now, that I disagree with.  What?  I'm not known for.  You're known for that, Jimmy.  I'm known for being a worm who gets, who have I fought with?  Jesse Ventura, Pendul at once, and then we liked each other, and the wrestler, Chris Jericho.  Yeah.  It's like I fight with our celebrity guests.  You do a lot more than that, and in most cases, you're not fighting with the celebrity guests.  Absolutely.  No, I'm usually groveling and pretending their movies are good when they suck.  That was a Jim Dandy film you did.  Yeah.  Hollander insisted he's willing to debate Norton on Opie and Anthony again, but said he's learned a lesson. 
[00:24:30]  The next time somebody starts cursing on me on the air, I'll just hang up, he said.  They're just a bunch of cowards who hide behind microphones.  But we called him a coward.  Now he's calling us cowards.  That's not nice.  That's name called.  Don't defame me.  I'm not a coward.  Why you?  I'm a girly man countersuit.  Yeah.  Let's jump into a break.  The phones aren't going anywhere.  Everyone has a comment.  If you want to add to the comments, 877-212-0&A.  And then you have an issue with the post, and there are... 
[00:25:00]  A little bit.  I like the fact they show a photo of Opie, Anthony, and the lawyer.  How about old brown eyes here?  Well, the picture is taken from your viewpoint.  Okay.  It's Norton's eye.  Jesus.  Good point.  That's a good point, Jimmy.  Opie and Anthony.  Never a dull moment on the Opie and Anthony show.  We know what this song is.  We come back to this.  I love this.  Yeah, I love this.  You like this one? 
[00:25:30]  877-212-0&A.  We're in the middle of talking about Jim Norton's lawsuit.  I know.  I've never been sued before.  In my opinion, a very frivolous lawsuit.  Of course it is.  Getting a lot of coverage today in the papers.  A lot of people want to talk about it on the phones.  Stunt Brain did a little search and found out that this guy that's suing you has how many?  Eight. 
[00:26:00]  Eight lawsuits he's dealing with right now.  Eight active lawsuits.  And we can't really, unless we pay the money, we can't really find out what the lawsuits are  all about.  Really?  How much does it cost?  How much?  How much?  Why don't we pay the three bucks?  Oh, it's three bucks?  Twenty bucks?  Why don't we pay that?  Wait, I get the goddamn twenty bucks.  I think this is what this guy does.  He's a frivolous lawsuit guy.  You know what the thing is about the lawsuits?  Like, this is what annoys me about the way the legal system gets tied up.  It's like, when you're suing somebody, if someone goes on the air and you're a regular citizen 
[00:26:30]  and there's somebody saying, ah, this guy's a pedophile, this guy's a murderer, this guy's  a drunk, or whatever they're saying about you, and they're wrecking your reputation,  to me, you have a right to sue them.  Yeah.  You know, if there's somebody who's seriously trying to hurt you, if you're a lawyer and  you get into an on-air argument with somebody who agreed with you and then disagreed with  you, and it gets nasty, to actually sue for that, to me, there's something so repulsive  about that, to tie the legal system up with that garbage.  Speaking of which, the phones are lit with exactly that, Jimmy. 
[00:27:00]  Mike in Wisconsin.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Mike.  Mike.  Is it true that Dragon Wagon is going to join us as a class action?  The class action suit.  Everyone that Jimmy's ever yelled at.  Yeah, Jimmy Moore and I don't get together.  Had a legendary argument with Dragon Wagon back in the day.  I would actually like to shake that guy's hand now.  We had such a nasty one.  What was that, 2002?  Yeah.  That's when he first came back on the air.  Yeah, it's a while ago.  Everett in Canada.  Everett.  Hello, sir.  Hey. 
[00:27:30]  I was going to call in and be a smart aleck, but actually what it is, is I remember this  caller, and I think, truthfully, the only reason he's ripped up a Jimmy  is you guys called him out when Anthony was saying, no, I'm honest with women about  my age, and this guy admitted to being a liar when he was meeting younger women.  Did he say, all I remember is, from what I remember, he wouldn't tell his age.  Yeah.  And I think that annoyed me that, like, to me, that's a very, a woman's quality is the 
[00:28:00]  women say, don't, you know, don't ask how old a lady is.  I think that annoyed me a lot that somebody wouldn't, like, I'm 40 years old, and there's  times I want to have sex with girls who are 21, you know, there's times, yes, there's  24 hours in the day where I want to have sex with women who are in their early 20s,  but I would never lie to them about my age, and I would never lie by omission.  Yeah.  And I think that annoyed me.  And again, I'm going by memory.  This is a couple months ago.  But why would anyone not say their age?  There's no shame in your age.  Exactly.  And I remember him admitting to you, if you guys go back and listen to this, he admitted 
[00:28:30]  that he don't tell them his proper age.  Yeah.  Now we have to go listen to that segment again.  It was one of those who gives a crap segments.  It was okay.  We remember Jimmy was awesome in it, but then we moved on with our show.  To him, it was everything, and now he's suing over it.  Yeah.  Well, I think, and my, if I got just a second for my smart-ass comment, I think what it  is is Anthony's going to be sued because some trucker's retread come off and he blew up  and hit the ditch.  That's right.  Yesterday I was bashing a trucker.  Yes.  I said, I hope his retread blows and he goes into a ditch and explodes. 
[00:29:00]  God, did he have me annoyed.  Did he?  Oh.  Why?  And you know something?  I don't even remember now.  Did he call you a celebrity hound?  Yes.  You fake man of the people?  It wasn't justified.  It really wasn't justified.  I'm trying to remember.  Do you remember Danny or anybody?  Because you were talking about truckers that when you're doing the shoulder thing, they're  going to let, some of these guys, you know, won't let you through.  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  And that angered this guy and he said he would basically, you know, crash into you.  And big traffic jams.  If you were doing that to him, right.  And big traffic jams, I'll just do whatever the hell I please to get out of the traffic  jam.  And a lot of times truckers will pull onto the shoulder to keep you from passing.  And this guy is calling me an ass and I don't know how to drive.  So I just unloaded on him and wished a fiery truck wreck on him.  Yeah.  I love you.  And he got a little.  It was hilarious.  Booby man from Brooklyn.  The listener's having a good time with this.  The booby man.  Yeah.  He writes, Opie, you better read my instant feedback or I will sue. 
[00:30:00]  Sue everyone.  I'm a lawyer for God's sakes.  Oh God.  I hate the legal system.  Jimmy hurt me with his words.  With his words, he hurt me.  Well, my head was bashed apart and my shoes fell off.  What words hurt you?  Something phony.  And the fact that he said I had sex with a chicken.  I would never have sex with chickens. 
[00:30:30]  Well, the chicken avoided having sex with you.  He crossed the road and there was traffic.  I was in danger.  I understand the chicken is suing for the implication too.  And the chicken?  The chicken, yes.  The chicken.  That's if you're being a woman, you're chicken.  He's chicken.  I'm a fool.  I'm a celebrity hound.  You are.  Are you chasing celebrities?  Oof!  Oof!  If you're just tuning in, Jimmy's getting sued.  Because we've got a whole new audience now.  They're still waking up. 
[00:31:00]  And you could read, how about you read that article and that'll bring everyone up to date  and then you could kind of...  Well, the first one was I think by Jose, his name was?  Jose Martinez.  Who said he reached out for comment.  And he very well may have through email or something like that.  That's possible.  I don't always get to my emails, anybody in the press who's...  But this Dara Gregorian, just, you know, unless they have an old number for me,  is annoying me.  Opie, I like when they don't have a lot of room for the headline, so they just kind  of like, they really...  The folks are masters at condensing these things.  Yeah.  Why?  Into something that has nothing to do with the story. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, why that headline?  Because your name is the recognizable one.  I know I'm not famous enough to have my own headline and Anthony isn't just too common  a name.  So they took Opie.  Yeah.  It says, Opie DJ is bestial, colon, guest suit.  Opie DJ is bestial, guest suit.  You know, there's a guy that that's his whole job is to write headlines.  And that's the best headline is so confusing.  You have no clue what the story's about.  And self-proclaimed, self-proclaimed... 
[00:32:00]  Oh, are we going to have to dump that?  Why?  I'm teasing, of course.  Oh, I didn't do a good job of reading.  Yes.  Self-proclaimed...  Self-proclaimed anti-feminist lawyer Roy Denhollander has filed a $500,000 lawsuit against an Opie  and Anthony show host who, he says, defamed him on air by calling him a whore who had sexual 
[00:32:30]  designs on chickens.  When you read it in the paper, it's so much funnier than when you hear it.  It's wonderful.  Can we play our chicken audio today?  Get that ready, but go ahead.  Continue.  Oh, here he goes.  And then in quotes, the chicken crossed the road because it thought that Hollander would  try to F it, Jim Norton said on the satellite radio show.  How do you sue for that? 
[00:33:00]  How do you sue for that as a man?  Yeah.  How do you prove it?  Right.  Yeah.  How do you get into the chicken?  The chicken would have to confirm that that's indeed why he crossed the road and that's  impossible to do.  No.  Chickens can't testify in open court.  Of course they can't.  Is that why you crossed the road?  We don't know what he's saying.  What is he saying?  He's food.  The stenographer throws her hands up in the air.  I don't know.  He's just pecking and running around stupidly.  What does that mean in chicken talk?  Either that or just have a chicken stenographer pecking at the keys like they do when they 
[00:33:30]  play that stupid tic-tac-toe at the carnival.  Dumb looking chicken.  But I think it's called, and somebody who knows more about English than I do, I think  it's called, like something so ridiculous that it's obviously not believable in comedy  or whatever it's called.  I think it's hyperbole.  Is that what it is?  Ooh.  Where it's such nonsense.  It's such over the top idiocy in an argument.  Like when you say this, like little things, and again, I don't know if this is accurate.  Ah, the Giants, man, they killed the Jets.  No rational thinking person thinks that the Giants murdered the New York Jets. 
[00:34:00]  There's these things in our language that we just know you just kind of, you know, whatever.  So nobody really thinks that the chicken crossed the road, in all honesty, to avoid having  sex with this man.  Like there's not any rational person that would hear that and believe that's why the chicken  crossed the road.  And you, again, could never prove it since chickens don't have a grasp on our language.  And it would react the same if you said, is that why you crossed the road?  Or did you cross the road because you're a dumb animal who thought there was feed over 
[00:34:30]  there?  I would love to see a lawyer stand up and say, could you point out the chicken if he's in  this courtroom right now?  And a little chicken sitting in the stand.  You have to point him out.  Has a chicken tie.  Yo, chicken.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then they bring the chicken on to testify and there's a hush over the courtroom.  He's fighting because no one thought the chicken was going to show up.  They thought he was going to shoot himself like Marguson in a few good men in a hotel 
[00:35:00]  room and put on his dress chicken blues and commit suicide.  But the chicken shows up in court.  But Jimmy, by the way, I got to clear something up because I don't feel like suing.  I don't have a bestial colon.  No.  Oh, right.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  You're right.  Opie is right.  I said Opie DJ's Beachy.  And the colon was actually in the newspaper.  Oh, OK.  I was saying no.  I mean, I have my issues, but I don't have a bestial colon.  No, I would have said sweet. 
[00:35:30]  So let me continue here.  It's on the center.  OK, let me read this in case anybody missed it.  In quotes, it's a host who, he says, defamed him on air by calling him a whore who had sexual  designs on chickens.  And in quote, the chicken crossed the road because it thought that.  But Hollander, quote again, would try to effort, Jim Norton said, on the satellite radio show  in August.  Hollander said he'd agreed to go on the show for what he thought would be an intelligent  discussion about a suit he filed seeking to force Columbia University to drop its women's 
[00:36:00]  studies programs.  Like, first of all, who comes on this show thinking this is where I'm going to go to  have an intelligent discussion?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Who in their right mind would go on this show to think they're going to have.  And I think a lot of times people are surprised when we do have them.  Right.  But that's not our.  But who thinks this is NPR?  Right.  Yeah.  Just by the name of the show.  And I do a lot of press.  See, this is the event.  I do a lot of press as well. 
[00:36:30]  Like, I do phone calls on the radio shows.  And I always, like, let the buyer beware.  Let the caller beware.  I always do a little bit of homework on every radio show I'm calling into.  Never once will my publicist put me on a radio show.  And I don't know what kind of radio show it is.  Ever.  And if I am dumb enough to just call radio shows, then, again, let the caller beware.  Why would I be so stupid as to call radio shows and not know who I'm calling?  Why would I go on a forum nationally and not have any idea about the radio show? 
[00:37:00]  All you got to do is Google it or find out or ask.  It's silly.  He, well, obviously, with eight lawsuits running in New York, this guy is one of those lawyers  that just likes to sue.  Likes to sue.  It's his thing.  Everyone tries to come up with their thing.  And I hate the legal system.  I hate the legal system being abused like this because there are legitimate cases that  have to be addressed.  And I hate seeing this abuse.  Jim in Texas.  Jim. 
[00:37:30]  Hey, guys.  Just wondering, when Jim's testifying in court, is he going to look over at the fellow  and go, what up, bird?  Goddamn, that's a good one.  What up, bird?  Please point out the chicken.  What up, bird?  Yo, what up, bird?  Oh, that's a damn good.  Thank you, David.  Nice.  I forgot to, and by the way, I think he was right.  Michael K.  Williams, Omar was right.  The scene he shot was in season two.  There you go.  I was trying to correct him.  Of course he was right.  It's his show.  I know.  I'm a dope.  Oh, hope he doesn't sue me.  Oh. 
[00:38:00]  All right.  Where are we in this article?  Here we are.  We were out of the chicken.  Yeah.  I had no idea who these guys were, he said of the shock jocks, whose raunchy antics once  got them temporarily kicked off terrestrial radio.  Yeah, we remember.  The appearance went bad after 10 minutes as show co-host Norton started calling Hollander  a white dude hypocrite and a phony, the suit says.  Did I say a white dude hypocrite?  I don't think you said a white dude hypocrite.  I think you said a white guilt-ridden, you know, whatever it was, that he had this white 
[00:38:30]  guilt.  Yes.  Hopefully I phrased it better than that.  Hopefully what I was trying to imply, I think my impression of him was that he was one of  those older white guys that wants to kind of ingratiate himself to the black community  and was afraid to do something that would be seen as like, you know, racist or too pro-white.  I think that's what my impression was.  He's got such an agenda, this guy, and it comes off as very misogynistic.  He was against the women's studies groups, and then the black studies groups, he said,  were fine because they didn't promote any kind of hatred or things like these women's 
[00:39:00]  groups do.  That's what he said.  And then we brought up plenty of examples of black groups that have had people give speeches  that are known to give hate speech, and he just wouldn't buy it.  And that's why we called him a hypocrite.  Yes, and I felt it was a double standard, and that's what annoyed me, especially when you're  getting into legal issues.  Like, if you're just a guy having a debate, but when it comes to, you're going into court,  and all of a sudden, I'm arguing with you, and I think, wow, that's really inconsistent 
[00:39:30]  thinking, and that's real inconsistency.  That's going to annoy me.  And I remember he said, well, you know, it's scientifically been proven that male and females  are different, but there is no difference racially, according to science.  And I think my rebuttal was, well, yes, but there are differences racially in social settings.  And we all know that, so to deny that is just stupid or dishonest.  I mean, we all know that there's differences socially in the way we're raised, whether  you're black or white or Italian or Irish or Jews.  That's cultural.  Cultural differences. 
[00:40:00]  And the last one here, it says, I called him a white dude hypocrite, which hopefully,  again, I phrased it less ridiculously.  I have a feeling you said exactly that.  I want to hear that clip and hear you say white dude hypocrite.  I'm going to bet you said exactly that.  I very well might have to see you going, you're just a white dude hypocrite.  Yeah, you're not giving yourself credit.  I think you said it, and it came across really funny.  With a very Bob Kelly delivery.  You're a white dude hypocrite.  Or maybe I was doing Quincy. 
[00:40:30]  You're just a white dude hypocrite.  And you're a whole sick society.  Society.  You're just an escape goat.  You're an escape goat.  You're in the chicken hiding.  Now, before you answer the lawsuit, that's a call back to an old Quincy bit.  Yeah, of course.  Someone's like, got kicked off the radio once.  Yeah.  Well, it's been a few times.  He gave out Hollander's email address and urged listeners to harass him. 
[00:41:00]  I said this in the office.  I said in the office.  That's not true.  I read this.  I go, there's no way Jimmy's going to say to harass anybody.  I wouldn't.  We know better.  I really wouldn't say that.  You find the word harass in there because we know better, dummy.  And if I gave out any type of contact information, it would have been what was already posted  on a website.  Of course.  For instance, if you go to his website, can you go to his website real quick and just  see if there's an email?  Because I may have given that out.  It's a frivolous lawsuit dot com. 
[00:41:30]  And said, if you know this guy, you can contact him.  I've many times encouraged listeners to contact people.  It's right on the top.  Right there.  His email address is right on top.  Top of his page.  There you go.  So to encourage, I've never once on radio said, hassle somebody or her ever.  We want to know what some of these other lawsuits he's involved with.  Yeah.  I want to know subject matter.  I want to know his win loss record on these things.  Who has eight lawsuits going at one time?  I really.  This guy.  What does that say about a person? 
[00:42:00]  This guy.  And can I say the last sentence here?  This is what bothers me about Derek Gregorian.  Gregorian.  Norton did not return a call about the suit filed in Manhattan.  Unless you didn't leave a message, Dara.  I don't know who you are, but from the post.  You did not leave me a message.  I checked my cellular and I checked my home message.  I did not get any messages from anybody in the press.  So don't say you called and left me a message.  It's absolutely not the truth.  This is the M.O. of a lot of reporters.  We have so many people working for the show.  Call her up and go, all right, how did you try to get a hold of Norton? 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  How do these news people, they can't get a hold of Jim Norton?  Hold on.  I like the way Anthony implies that I'm such a nobody that it's very easy.  Now, please.  Oh, well.  I wasn't implying that.  I have people protecting me.  We're just going to bring you down to earth a little bit, Jimmy.  You out there in Hollywood being a big star.  You had to come back and get knocked down a couple.  And it was a possibility.  Doing three TV shows in one week.  What's wrong with you?  I know.  I heard that.  Did you hear the Carson Daly?  I did that for you guys.  You're a whore.  I heard that Carson Daly was hilarious with the Steve stuff.  We'll get into it after the break. 
[00:43:00]  This is Norton's Welcome Back show.  It's going to be all about Jimmy today.  I feel very good.  Highlighted break sign.  All right.  We'll take a break and come back.  We want to catch up a little bit.  So we'll go and come back.  But to say that I've encouraged listeners to harass somebody is an out-and-out lie.  I've never once, no matter how angry I was, said for listeners to do that.  I've asked listeners to contact somebody if they know him and find out what's going on.  Because people listen and they all know.  And I've gotten great information about doing things like that.  Or if we have a heated discussion with somebody and they have a public website with their email address on there, 
[00:43:30]  we can absolutely direct listeners to that website, to the email address, and say,  and I think what you said was, hey, you heard it.  Email this guy.  Let him know what you think about it.  The word harass never comes up.  Hey, do you think where is that stupid to even use the word harass?  And I wouldn't want you to be harassed.  There are people who hate me who would have sided with you.  It's all fair game. 
[00:44:00]  Listeners could write you and say, hey, we agree with you, too.  This guy can't be for real.  It comes down to this.  He can't be for real.  I'm still thinking this is a joke.  Yeah, right?  Well, he's probably at his hip-hop class.  Dude, the thought of him doing hip, look at him.  The thought, he looks like Tom Brokaw.  Yes.  Doing hip-hop.  He looks like Tom Chiasano, actually.  A hip-hop, a hibby, a hibby, hip-hip-hop.  You just insulted Chiasano, but it's kind of accurate.  He looks like every high school math teacher you've ever had. 
[00:44:30]  Did they Photoshop the dandruff off the suit?  That looks like the type of dark suit that would just have dandruff on it.  I hate lawyers.  I hate them.  And when you go into a court, you just see them, and they're all from the same mold.  And this guy is just uber lawyer to me.  He's just one of these guys.  Eight running lawsuits.  Please.  All right, we should take a break.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  I will explain that one later in the show. 
[00:45:00]  Opie and Anthony, 877-212-ON-A.  Never a dull moment.  This show is rocking lately.  I just got to say that.  Yesterday, it was all about creepy gay kid.  And today, it's about Jim Norton involved in a frivolous lawsuit.  A frivolous.  Dude, we should bring Jimmy up to speed.  So Sam decided to come out of the closet, which is weird, because today is the day I think you're supposed to come out of the closet.  Today is National Coming Out Day. 
[00:45:30]  Is it?  But Sam decided yesterday, you're a rebel.  Why didn't you save it for today to tell everyone you're gay?  I'm not gay.  But you are.  No, it's a character.  You're now officially Creepy Gay Kid.  Creepy Gay Kid.  There's a character I play called Creepy Gay Kid.  It's sweeping the nation.  Jimmy was out there in L.A., and Bob Kelly was in Jimmy.  I don't know how Bobby has a crush on Sam.  A crush on Sam.  Yeah.  And it was Bobby's birthday, so we said, what do you want for your birthday, Bobby? 
[00:46:00]  And he said, I want Sam to sing Happy Birthday to me in a sexy way.  You know, like the Marilyn Monroe, JFK kind of thing.  Yeah.  So Sam came in to do that.  He was more than willing, which was a little strange to all of us.  Yeah.  And then Bobby kind of told him to, what, make your shirt into a half shirt.  Yeah, he said he wanted me to be wearing a half shirt for it.  So he tied his shirt up in a knot.  In a knot.  And knew exactly how to do it in a second.  Oh, yeah.  Well, if you just bring up the bottom through the neck. 
[00:46:30]  See, I didn't know.  See, yeah.  Jimmy's looking at a picture.  I mean, I could see where you'd enjoy having Happy Birthday sung by him in that.  Yeah.  I could see that, but that would be kind of erotic.  And the video's to your right, Jimmy.  So then we think nothing of it.  It's Sam looking very, very gay and singing Happy Birthday to Bob.  So, you know, Sam makes the videos for the show.  He puts it up on YouTube as Creepy Gay Kid Sings Happy Birthday.  So he nicknames himself Creepy Gay Kid. 
[00:47:00]  I just wanted something people would click on.  And the video had a nice run yesterday and showed up on a gay socialite website.  It made gay socialite.com and a website called jackbook.com.  It made jackbook.com.  What about calling it Creepy Pal Talk Ghoul in the background?  Yeah.  Look at me.  I'm not paying any attention to Sam.  I just have my hand on the mouse.  Yeah.  And I'm scrolling, scrolling.  Still doing research for the show, huh? 
[00:47:30]  I never realized that that ended up on so many gay sites.  And I'm predominantly displayed in the background.  So it was a big thing yesterday.  And then Sam decided he needed a follow-up hit because it's all about Creepy Gay Kid on the Internet these days.  So you were dancing to I'm Too Sexy by Wright said Fred yesterday, Jimmy.  And he took a shirt off for Bobby and allowed Bobby to squirt lotion a little bit.  Lotion.  Yes.  And that video is going to be up on, what, Monday? 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, we'll put it up over the weekend.  I want to kiss more guys.  That was a recording.  Why do you want to kiss more guys?  Yeah.  I don't.  Yeah, all right.  I want to kiss more guys.  All right.  We get it, Sam.  We know you do.  It's coming out day.  Yeah.  How many people are going to come out?  How many disappointed dads are we going to have today?  Why do you think someone's not in studio today?  I'm not sick.  I had phone calls to make.  Yes.  Steve chose today to be sick, so he's not here. 
[00:48:30]  And we had a big thing planned for him.  I'm not sick.  I'm worried.  Which we'll do another day.  Nervous.  Hey, we got Bret Hart coming in today.  Yep.  The hit man.  Yeah.  And he wrote a book.  And Sam's saying it's the best wrestling book ever written.  Yeah, I thought.  Better than McFoley's and all that?  McFoley's was my favorite for a while, but it's easily the most honest and inside book.  This guy's talking about the steroids in wrestling.  Everything.  He's talking about cheating on his wife on the road.  Yep.  He's talking about the death of his brother.  Yep.  Does he talk about the time when he punched Vince McMahon? 
[00:49:00]  Absolutely.  In that documentary?  Yep.  All right, cool.  Everything.  We're going to have him on in a few minutes.  But Jimmy was out in L.A. and had a great appearance on Carson Daly.  I was actually, I was, the music guest a lot of times brings in the audience with Late  Night.  And I got this last minute and they said Young Jeezy, who's apparently a big rapper.  Young Jeezy?  And Nas.  Oh, yeah.  Nas.  But Nas's plane was late.  So the way Carson Daly works is you have the interview.  The cat was interviewed and then me.  And then there's like a 20 minute break and then they perform live outside and they put 
[00:49:30]  the whole thing together for a show.  Wait, Kat from L.A. Inc.?  Yeah.  Oh, you know who she is, right?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't know who she was.  She was really sexy.  I didn't get a shot with her.  I think she's dating Nikki Sixx.  Oh, is she?  Okay.  You've never seen L.A. Inc.?  No.  She's really hot, though.  Yeah.  And the crowd loved her.  So I thought the crowd was going to be a rough, oh my God, they're going to be a  hip hop crowd.  They're going to hate me.  They're trying to be great, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Carson certainly knows you guys.  And I wish I would have mentioned it on the air, but I was talking about Roland and how  creepy he was.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  And he's like, I would love to come on and just talk about Roland. 
[00:50:00]  I'm like, dude, we have to get you on the phone for an hour.  Have we told everyone that Roland was like Carson Daly's personal assistant for a long  time?  Yeah.  Have we talked about that on our show?  I don't know if we've mentioned it.  I mean, we've lived with Carson for years.  Yeah.  Oh, we've got to get Carson on just to talk about Roland.  Oh, yeah.  He would certainly do it.  L.A. Inc., though, man.  It's a great show.  They do some amazing tats.  I should have got a ... I didn't talk to her.  She is a really sexy girl.  She's so hot, and she's messing up her face with tattoos.  She's got, like, face tattoos and everything.  Most of her body is tatted up. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  I like that.  She's in a room.  Yeah.  All right.  Norton on Carson Daly.  Let's go through this a little bit.  Yeah, just the first minute or two, because I just did that for you guys.  Making fun of Steve.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And Steve's not here, unfortunately.  All right.  Young Jeezy outside in a little bit.  Our next guest is a very funny comedian and host of a brand new series, Down and Dirty,  which airs Fridays at Midnight, and it's hilarious.  It's on HBO.  Please welcome Jim Norton.  Jim.  And salvation. 
[00:51:00]  How are you?  We are all big fans of this new show.  This thing is just hilarious.  Thank you.  And it's great to have you on the show.  How's everything?  I'm good.  Where did she go?  I wanted to meet her.  She was fantastic.  You didn't see her in the back right now?  No.  She walked right by me.  I'm like, hi.  She's like, pfft.  She's a beautiful woman.  I would just let her kick me around a hotel room for hours.  She is fantastic.  I wanted to ask her, is there a way to tell if someone's gay by their tattoo?  Because my friend Steve, he swears he's not gay. 
[00:51:30]  But on his ass cheek, he has a tattoo of a yield sign.  I'm not gay.  Oh, God.  I like women.  All right.  Steve.  Steve.  You can stop it there.  Oh, you just bashed him.  Yeah, I did a Steve.  With no reason but to bashed him.  None.  Steve.  I couldn't wait to.  Is that her naked?  Yeah, just about.  Did they show her nude?  Oh, she is so sexy.  She's covered in tats. 
[00:52:00]  Too many tats.  Yeah.  She's too hot to have that many tattoos.  But that's her.  I know that's her thing and she owns a shop, but what are you doing?  She dating Nikki, huh?  That's a, well, I saw the commercial for the latest LA Inc.  And it looked like her and Nikki are an item.  Yeah.  You know how stupid I felt, by the way, in front of a non-O&A audience going,  I like girls.  Yeah.  They were laughing, though, Jimmy.  They did.  It was just so silly.  I want to hear this Norton on white people and Obama.  We got another quick clip.  It's so funny how, like, black people are very comfortable talking about Obama being black 
[00:52:30]  and wanting a black president.  White people are so afraid to acknowledge that.  Like, yeah, we might have a, it's almost like political correctness has kicked white  people in the teeth.  We don't even like to acknowledge race at all.  We're just like, really?  Is Barack black?  I hadn't even noticed.  Really?  See, I just focus on the issues.  Jimmy Kellen on Carson Dale.  Yeah, they were a great crowd, man.  His crowds are much better since he moved to LA, I've noticed.  I'm just watching him.  The LA crowds are much better for him. 
[00:53:00]  They're really, they were nice, yeah.  We thought about it yesterday, because there was some kind of crime committed here in New  York, and they were describing the suspect, and they're like, it's a white male.  White male.  And, wow, and just lost it, because I think you pointed that out to us, that they never  point out the fact that it could be a black male.  I'm telling you, that is paternalistic white people.  That is white people who see black people as less than them and are handling them differently.  You don't talk about somebody who you see as an equal like that. 
[00:53:30]  Like a guy who's just, you know what I mean?  You talk about that guy the same way you would talk about yourself.  That's how you deal with somebody who you have respect for.  So that, to me, is just, that's a condescending white person crap, which makes me sick.  And we're going to have a black president, man.  Yeah, we definitely are.  Well, it looks that way.  It's getting crazy.  I must say.  And McCain's losing his mind.  He's pulling out all the stops now.  My friends.  My friends.  You hear about the prisoners?  Yeah, yes.  Oh, and he said prisoners.  Can you get that for me?  But there's a debate going down on Long Island Wednesday.  We say this every time just before the debate that it's going to get really, really ugly or interesting. 
[00:54:00]  But I think this time around, McCain has nothing to lose.  And I think he might just lose his mind there or say some pretty crazy stuff, right?  Yeah, he doesn't look comfortable.  He really doesn't.  Well, because he can't believe that, you know, we're going to have Obama as president.  He doesn't think he's qualified for the position.  Yeah, I think McCain's a good guy.  He's just probably the pressure and he's probably not good at attacking. 
[00:54:30]  I don't think that's his real nature is attacking.  We played this yesterday.  This is what McCain said at a rally, I guess, two days ago now.  You and I together will confront the $10 trillion debt that the federal government has run up  and balance the federal budget by the end of my term in office.  Across this country, this is the agenda I have set before my fellow prisoners, 
[00:55:00]  and the same standards of clarity and candor must now be applied to my opponent.  My fellow prisoners.  And the audience is like, my fellow prisoners.  My fellow prisoners.  Oh, boy.  I was saying, he just instantly snapped back.  He was in a small cell in Southeast Asia, and he just, he was back there again.  My fellow prisoners.  His fantasy, he probably fantasized someday I'll be president. 
[00:55:30]  Like, we all have thought about how would I make great speeches.  And I'll bet you in that cell, he went through a lot.  I mean, I imagine you just, your mind is the only thing that keeps you going.  And you probably have all these weird moments.  And he probably made a million speeches in his own head in that cell,  just in the hours you're killing.  Yeah.  And that was probably one of them.  And God damn it, if that's going to hurt him badly.  Because they're already saying his age is affecting him.  Yeah.  Oh, that's going to hurt him.  My fellow prisoners.  Oh, John.  They're starting to say this could be a landslide victory for Obama.  Well, the only thing.  They're looking at the map trying to figure out what he has to do to win this thing, 
[00:56:00]  and it's not looking good.  The only thing that will trouble Obama is if Whitey goes into the voting booth  and just goes, you know something?  Nah.  No way.  Nah.  I've been saying yeah, but nah.  We'll see.  Yeah.  He would have to really, really screw up.  Because people are not, most white people are not that afraid of a black president,  like where all of a sudden you're going to go with a guy who's a little older.  Nah.  If Obama was running against, say, a Republican version of Bill Clinton, 
[00:56:30]  a guy, you know, eh, he'd be in trouble.  If we have Osama bin Laden on ice, you'll see him in the next couple of weeks, my friends.  Yeah, his beard will have frozen stuff in it.  I think we said yesterday it would be McCain dragging him out of the cave, you know,  all tied up like old school, like some old western or something, you know, behind a horse.  It leads to another clip from Norton on Carson Daly talking about campaigning. 
[00:57:00]  I like this clip, too.  I remember it.  I didn't want to like Barack because everybody liked him.  He was the hip guy.  And then you watch him talk.  And then, you know, look, everybody was worried.  Look, Jeremiah Wright, his reverend, it was scary.  I mean, you know, that was white people's worst nightmare.  And then it was like, you know what?  If that's the worst they can find on the guy, dad, his reverend said some stuff people don't like.  That's not bad.  I mean, let's be honest.  We all have friends that could ruin a campaign for us.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  You know.  Or band leaders.  Or band leaders.  Yeah.  You know, in my case, I'd announce my candidacy. 
[00:57:30]  A half hour later, transsexuals would pop out of the woodwork.  I'm voting for him.  He's a big tipper.  Band leader was laughing.  You know, you know, sometimes they look like girls.  No one's great about that clip.  You're making everyone uncomfortable, and it's hilarious.  But they don't know what to do with that, the audience.  They should be laughing their asses off.  They were young. 
[00:58:00]  That's good stuff.  They were cool with it, but they were like, I think Carson is a good interviewer, man.  Like, he really is in the moment with you.  It was.  Really?  Yeah.  Because just the other day, I think we were bashing his interviewing skills.  No, I didn't know because I had never sat down with him before.  And now that I sit down, they call me the couch kid.  So, I mean.  Well, of course.  He was actually right there in the moment.  He was actually really fun to talk to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How do you like hosting the show?  How does it.  It's really cool because typically I've always sucked as a host.  I just don't have the personality for it.  I'm aggressive. 
[00:58:30]  And luckily, my managers are the producers.  So, you know.  All right.  I don't know why I expected an applause break from that stupid fact.  A factoid.  It really was.  You just blurted out a factoid.  Yes, my manager's a producer and I expected him to carry me around the room in comedic celebration.  It's a great line, though.  Self-deprecating.  You know?  Yeah.  I just kind of threw it in, though.  Like, very matter-of-factly.  And then I walked all over.  Talk about someone who doesn't listen.  He had a funny line. 
[00:59:00]  He said, yeah, well, neither am I.  Like, about himself.  Yeah, yeah.  I just can bow up.  My point, my point, my point.  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  The me, me, bird.  What a me, boob I am.  Me, me.  Did you talk?  Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.  Me.  What a fool.  And one more clip.  Norton on Carson Daly.  Then we're going to have to take a quick break because I think Bret Hart's here.  Oh, cool.  He only has, like, 15, 20 minutes.  One more clip from Carson Daly.  I was thinking that, you know, with the election, with everything that's going on, maybe that's why,  I mean, aside from I love the talent and your stuff from Opie and Anthony, which is great,  is that the show, it seems like it's a great time for, like, just down and dirty. 
[00:59:30]  This is a lot of BS around here.  It's amazing how, like, how afraid people are to sleep.  Like, I get to tease Hillary Clinton.  Like, I'm from New York.  I like, I kind of like Hillary.  But, you know, those fat calves and ankles.  Can you really look at those fat calves?  I'm sorry.  I know it's, I don't want to look, I don't trust a woman who's the same thickness from the vagina down.  She has little fat legs, like the penguin from Batman.  Who wants to look at that for four more years? 
[01:00:00]  And that stupid, awful laugh.  I mean, don't get me wrong, I'd have sex with her.  All right, yeah.  Oh, Jesus.  That's just great.  No one is saying that on TV.  That's awesome.  And you know what?  They left it in.  Good for them.  That's awesome.  They could have beeped.  They didn't.  They kept it in.  That was great.  Good for NBC. 
[01:00:30]  It's just very edgy.  Thanks, man.  No one is doing edgy stuff like that on TV.  So, Down and Dirty, HBO, tonight at midnight after Bill Maher.  Hopefully Bill will throw me a plug, too.  Oh, Bill.  Oh, Bill.  You think he will?  He might.  He was very cool to me on the couch, man.  You think he'll throw you a bone?  He might.  He was very cool.  We had a lot of fun.  You shut him up good, man.  We did the whole clip where you got a really good laugh, and then Bill Maher had to jump  in to try to kind of trump you, and then you shut him up really good.  We really loved that.  We played that clip earlier this week.  Okay. 
[01:01:00]  I forgot the exact joke, but you killed, and then he felt like he had to throw something  in there, and then you slammed him down, man.  Honestly, I'm not even saying this because I know it sounds like I'm being a worm, but  I really think he was being just playful.  I didn't know what Bill was going to be like to do panel with.  I'm like, oh, he's not going to like me.  He was really cool, man.  I was surprised at how cool he was.  It was one of those things, though, where it's like, hey, you're on the couch now.  Jim's in the chair.  Shut your mouth.  Yeah, let Jimmy get the laugh.  Shut your mouth.  Let Jimmy talk and get the laughs.  You were getting a huge laugh, and he felt like he had to pipe in. 
[01:01:30]  I'm just disappointed in him because I really liked his movie, Religious, and he was in  town.  He doesn't stop by.  This is a perfect place for him to stop by and promote that movie of his.  So, whatever.  Quick break.  Bill, geez, Bret Hart is next.  Opie and Anthony.  Hey, good morning to everybody.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Very, very busy show.  Got Jim Norton being sued.  Frivolous lawsuit, in our opinion.  You've got the creepy gay kid over there. 
[01:02:00]  And we've got the great Bret Hart in studio right now, who wrote a great book, according  to Sam.  I haven't read it yet, Bret.  We thumbed through it, and we like what we see so far, but it's called Hitman.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice to be here.  Now, I want to start by simply saying, what happened to you?  Because all of a sudden, you were out of wrestling, and I don't know if a lot of people know what  happened.  Well, what happened, see, well, after my brother Olin's accident, I got kicked to the head 
[01:02:30]  by Bill Goldberg.  By accident, right?  By accident.  And I had a concussion problem for a couple years that I put the cherry on the cake about  two years later when I had a stroke.  You had a stroke?  I had a full-on stroke in 2002.  Wow.  Jesus.  I don't think a lot of people know that.  Did that, was that because of the kick to the head?  They could never prove it.  Yeah.  I believe it's, they're connected.  Wow.  So, how did that go down?  You were just kind of at home or something? 
[01:03:00]  Like, where were you?  I just, I was riding my bicycle.  I hit a, I hit like a little hole in the grass, and like actually a big hole, and I just  fell off my bike sideways and landed on my head.  I really, for a guy, I made a living landing on his head.  Yeah, right.  It was one little, tiny little, like a baby doing a little headstand on the grass.  I mean, it was nothing.  It wasn't even anything.  I didn't hurt myself or anything, except for the stroke.  But as soon as I hit the ground, I'd...  And you were just laying there knowing you were in deep trouble?  I didn't know anything. 
[01:03:30]  I thought I'd pinched a nerve or something, but I lost everything on my left side, like  instantly.  And I pretty much, from that point on, I was in a wheelchair for about three months.  Well, do you feel like when you're having a stroke, you just feel like half of your  body, you can't move?  Can you feel like, wow, I'm really, something horrible is happening right now?  No, it doesn't hurt.  It just, nothing hurt.  I just, half my body was dead.  Wow.  And it was like that from the next day till, it took me a couple of years to get through  that, in which case I got about, I would say somewhere between, I was really lucky. 
[01:04:00]  I got about 80, 90% back.  Wow.  So.  Where did, where did Goldberg kick you?  He kicked me right behind the head.  In the back of the head?  Yeah, right in the back of the head.  Almost like, I would compare it to someone taking a hockey stick and cracking you across  the back of the neck as hard as they can.  Did you, did you break anything back there or crack anything?  I got a hole in my neck about the size of a quarter.  Come on.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That, that, that, that'll never heal.  That just, it, is amazing. 
[01:04:30]  I can't, what, what move was he doing?  What, how did it screw up?  Because, I mean, you guys are flinging each other around like crazy anyway.  How did, how did that happen?  He gave me what, what I would guess would be called a mule kick.  Damn.  And it cracked your skull?  No, it just, it just.  Concussion?  Just bruised my brain big time.  Wrestlers have like real men injuries.  Like when Triple H was in talking about, what was it that flopped up?  His, uh.  Oh, his calf. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, his calf muscle.  His calf muscle, yeah.  He snapped the, the, what connects your calf muscle to your ankle and it rolled up into  the back of his leg or his shin or one, one of the two.  It was just.  Oh.  Yeah, so after the kick, after the kick to the head, that was it for you?  You never wrestled again?  No, it took me, I wrestled for two weeks until I finally went home and I was like.  And realized there's no way I could do this.  Jesus.  I was talking mush and my doctor said, you're done.  And I was, as soon as he told me I was done, I, I, um, stopped. 
[01:05:30]  Now, do you blame, um, uh, the, the stroke on wrestling on, on, on too many hits, uh, maybe  some of the steroids or, I mean.  Um, well, I don't think I did anything with steroids, but I think it, um, you're talking  about the stroke, you mean?  Yeah.  Like, what do you blame that on?  Do you blame that on too many hits?  I don't, I'll never know.  Nobody ever know.  Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody would come close.  There was no, really no explanation for it.  No, no history for it. 
[01:06:00]  Uh, like I said, the fall I took on the grass, if you've been sitting on the park bench watching,  you would have probably burst out laughing.  It was nothing.  Wow.  Do you have a bad relationship?  I don't, I don't, I don't follow wrestling.  Like, I know who you are, obviously, but I don't, I don't follow wrestling.  Do you have a bad relationship with, uh, with Vince and, and, and, uh, WWE or is it  like, is it, is it?  Nah, you know, when you're, when you go through what I've gone through with a lot of, like my brother  and all the things that have happened and the stroke, you, you kind of learn to move  on past those kinds of things. 
[01:06:30]  Like you can't, you can't carry around a lot of hard feelings.  I think the only thing I can say about the stroke that it was, they, the one big factor  is stress.  Stress is a real big factor that people don't really think about sometimes, but there is  no explanation for me for having a stroke.  But I do know that I was under a lot of stress.  Yeah.  I mean, you had a lot of, you had your brother die and a lot of other guys you were close  to in, in wrestling died.  My brother-in-law, the British Bulldog, had died about maybe 10 days before that.  Before your stroke? 
[01:07:00]  Before my stroke.  And then he, how did he die?  Um, he, I think he overdosed.  It was an overdose?  Wow.  And then you were also friends with, uh, Chris Benoit.  He trained with you back in the day, right?  Yeah.  I knew Chris from the time he was about 12 years old.  So, is it, this, uh, Bret Hart?  It's like you guys are in a war or something, you know?  No, you're just watching your buddies, uh, uh, dying.  That's pretty, pretty awful.  And that's why Hitman's, that's why Hitman's gonna be a great read, because you're, you're  not holding back.  A lot of guys, they, they kind of hold back when they, when they write about their lives. 
[01:07:30]  And, uh, and Sam said, wow, this book is amazing.  He doesn't hold back at all.  You talk about how the guys used to line up to get, uh, possibly steroids.  I don't know.  I don't know how it's, uh, put in the book, but, uh, behind the scenes, there was a doctor  and he was shooting everybody up.  Like, not many wrestlers are.  I don't remember him shooting anybody up, but I remember him, uh, distributing, distributing  his steroids, uh, like candy to everybody, uh, steroids and downers and whatever else 
[01:08:00]  he had.  He was, was it much different than a drug addict or a drug selling, a drug dealer selling drugs  at a, at a school ground or something.  You wrote a, this is a 550 page book.  Like, this is not just like a quick, I need to make money book.  No.  It's like double space.  You know, some guys will write like what amounts to 120 pages and they just double space.  This is like a real, yeah.  Like your book.  No, no.  My book, my book's all substance.  I mean, how many prostitute stories can you tell?  Two books worth, by the way.  Hey, Sam, you read this entire, uh, entire book. 
[01:08:30]  What, uh, you, and you know everything about wrestling.  Um, despite the fact that on this show, you're, you're basically an albatross.  What, um, what, uh, was the most amazing thing you learned?  Cause you, he really did love your book.  Yeah.  What was the most interesting thing you learned from the book?  And he, he reads all the wrestling books.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, I think one of the keys to this book is it's not commissioned by WWE.  So it's, it's Brett's story.  It's not like a ghost writer who's in with the WWE.  So, well, you can't say that, but you could say this, but it just, Brett's honest recollection, 
[01:09:00]  opinion of everything that happened.  And, and I mean, for the people who are my age who grew up watching wrestling, you get  to get this inside story before there was an internet.  Like now people kind of know what's going on behind the scenes or they think they do  because of what's reported on the internet.  But in like the eighties, the early nineties, nobody knew anything except what was on TV.  And Brett's book kind of is the first that I've read that really honestly goes back there  and tells you everything that was going on. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  I mean, the detail he gets into about the stuff that was going on, you know, 10, 15 years  ago is incredible.  Right.  You openly talk about how you were cheating on your wife on the road.  I just try to put it in perspective as to what brings those kinds of things about.  But what, what, how does that come about?  Opportunity.  Just opportunity.  Yeah.  Well, no, I really think if you took, took, take the, you know, like I was 20 years old when  I got into wrestling.  I was 43 when I got out.  23 straight years of, of, uh, probably pretty close to 300 days a year, not including travel 
[01:10:00]  days home, which was, I had the farthest trip back from most of all the wrestlers to get  home.  It was usually a half day to get home.  Where was home?  Calgary, Canada.  Yeah.  So I, I was, I lived a life in a suitcase and was gone.  And most of the little, um, affairs and things like that that you have on the road are, I  don't look at them so much as bad things.  I look at them as, um, survival.  Like I think a lot of the people that I was with, I look at them as good friends that helped 
[01:10:30]  me through it, you know, some tough times.  You can't just hang around with wrestlers for 23 years.  That's a good way to put it.  Good friends.  A good egg.  I mean, how could you be faithful on the road if you're out there three, 300 days a year?  Like, how do you have a real relationship with somebody back home?  How does that work?  I can't be faithful when I'm gone for a weekend.  I, I just, you know, in a lot of, and even, um, you know, I, I think I got my break in wrestling  because I wasn't one of the steroid freak kind of guys. 
[01:11:00]  They needed someone that could carry the banner for the company and not get, uh, not fail a drug  test or get busted at a border or something like that.  This is back in, uh, like when they had in the 90, early 90, when they started real, real  drug testing.  And, uh, I think that's how I kind of got my spot as champion.  Right.  Right.  But, uh, even steroids prior to that in the 84, 85, when I was taking steroids or did take  them like, just like everyone else kind of thing, you don't have much choice.  Like I don't, people say, you know, like, you know, you're in this room with all these 
[01:11:30]  guys that are all, everybody's juiced up to the gills, you know, and it's, you want to  be competitive and feed your family.  You better, you want to be a winner or you want to be a, one of the bottom guys on the  card.  You have this kind of decision you make right away.  I never took steroids ever till I got to, to that point in my life and no one made me  take them or.  Were you happy with it after it?  Like after you took them and noticed a difference where you're like, wow, you should have done  this a long time ago.  I always took them cause I blew my, completely blew my knee out and, uh, at the time when 
[01:12:00]  I was starting.  So I was really scared I was going to miss my opportunity cause I couldn't do anything.  And I took, um, started taking steroids a few months before I got here.  And, uh, I actually had a tour to Japan at the time.  And I know that if I hadn't taken them for that, I took them just two weeks before I went  to Japan for the first time ever.  And I would never have made it to Japan.  I would never have been able to survive that tour.  And I, I remember on the tour, I did, I could do everything.  Like it seemed like within three weeks of the muscle started coming back and I could, 
[01:12:30]  I was doing drop kicks and all my stuff that I hadn't done for about nine months.  Cause even when I was blew my knee out, which was in February of that year, I wrestled right  till July with a bad knee till there was no other way around.  That's what it is.  You guys have to, you have to work injured or else, you know, somebody else is going to  step into your spot.  Yeah.  It's then there's, um, no one to pay the bills, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's, there's no, uh, it's like, as soon as you get hurt in wrestling, you're  a liability. 
[01:13:00]  They just, you know, they'll pat you on the back and tell you, they'll call you in above  four months.  Yeah.  There's no like pension plan or, uh, severance pay or anything like that.  It's just pretty much you're gone and you know, make a life for yourself other than wrestling.  When you were taking the steroids, uh, they talk about road, uh, road, uh, road rage, excuse  me.  I, I, did you feel any of that?  Did you feel differently psychologically?  No, not really.  I, I wasn't not too heavy into them.  I mean, I took them, I thought fairly, uh, yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Practically.  Because it leads to the Chris, uh, Benoit, uh, situation.  A lot of people said he had the roid rage.  Well, he might've had some roid rage.  I mean, I, and I don't doubt that steroids could have been a contributing factor, but  I don't never believe for a second that they were the deciding factor in that.  Yeah.  We've talked to a lot of you guys since that happened and they, they're all just shocked  that he would ever do anything like that.  Chris was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet.  He was kind of one of those guys that for the whole time I ever knew him, he'd walk a  little old lady across the street kind of guy.  He was a nice guy that, uh, I think you got to look at more to, uh, judge him by that 
[01:14:00]  kind of part of his character.  What do you think happened?  Do you think there's rumors he might've had like some kind of seizure or something going  on in his head that was undetected that just, I think he had, I think that the, you, if  you look close and as they have, I think you'll find that it was probably related to all those  head injuries that he had.  Uh, I heard his head, his brain was like mush at the end.  Like it was just, he had the brain of a 90 year old, uh, Alzheimer's kind of guy.  He was, he was, I think pretty fuzzy in the head.  And I know from my own circumstance with concussions that you can have a concussion. 
[01:14:30]  Um, as bad as I did.  And I had a really bad one and, um, I still have lingering effects from that.  And, um, when you have a concussion, you can still, I can remember Vince McMahon talking  about how he used to try, he could catch airplanes, he could rent his car, he could drive to the  building.  And I was like, how, how messed up is this guy?  It's like, well, you know, I was like a robot.  I was like a robot for two years and I couldn't, I, I could do everything.  I could have a conversation like I am with you guys right now. 
[01:15:00]  As a matter of fact, I think I was doing a book tour back then and doing a lot of media  and all this stuff.  I don't remember any of it.  It was all just a blur, you know?  Damn.  So people don't know.  They think, oh, he's fine.  I just talked to him.  Yeah.  He can talk.  You just can't remember anything he said.  You know, I wouldn't remember anything that I talked to you about.  Like being in a blackout, an alcoholic blackout.  Yeah, probably.  And I think Chris, I don't know exactly what the circumstances were, but I think my gut  feeling tells me that he was in a situation where he was getting pressured or a lot of 
[01:15:30]  pressure put on him by his wife to be home more.  And at the same time, I think he was getting a lot of pressure on the, from the wrestling  company to say, look, we need, if you want to be one of the top guys, we need more, we  need you on the road more.  So he's in this horrible tug of war with his wife and the, and the business.  And I think he, in the end, that was maybe what, it just drove him off the deep end.  Maybe he came home and they had a fight or something.  I don't know.  It just snapped.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow. 
[01:16:00]  Wow.  Wow.  It's just so much tragedy in wrestling.  Yeah.  It really is odd because it's such a, you know, entertaining, fun thing to watch.  It's a cartoon world.  And then, yeah, yeah, on the outside, but then you tear away just a little bit of that  curtain and it's just full of tragedy.  Just unbelievable.  Your, your brother's death was, was horrific in front of a, a, a crowd like that and stuff.  I, I'm sure that, you know, obviously affected you. 
[01:16:30]  So, um, what, what was that like, uh, going through that, in those circumstances?  Well, you know, it's just one of those things that you just, I'll never understand, uh, what  Owen was thinking because Owen was a, he was the most careful, cautious guy in the world.  Like he didn't take any chances doing anything like that.  Wow.  I guess all I can say is he must have really felt that, um, that it would be done right,  that it would be, that the safety would be the, you know, they'd have, they'd know what 
[01:17:00]  they're doing.  Right.  And in the end, I guess, sadly enough, the guy that put that stunt together didn't know  what he was doing and it was just a horrible tragedy.  Was it something, I remember what had happened, obviously, was it, was it something, was it,  was it, was it, the thing snapped or it wasn't set up right or they didn't safety test  it?  No, the harness, uh, wasn't connected.  The safety clip that, uh.  Wasn't connected or something.  It had eight pounds, it had eight pounds pressure.  Yeah.  And so it was like, basically had, as I remember the Kansas City, uh, policemen tell me, it 
[01:17:30]  was, it had the same, like if you pulled the trigger on a gun, that's all it took to release  him.  And I think Owen, when he got all the way up to the top, which is pretty high when you  get up there, I remember looking at it and he was hanging there and I think he did,  he just run up and took off while he had, uh, overalls on and had to take that and pull  it off and pull it off over his boots and then he had this mask on, he had to put the  mask on and the cape and all that and then they, then they got him to climb over, off  like right next to the score clock, climb out and hang there. 
[01:18:00]  And it only takes eight pounds pressure to release that safety clip.  Oh my gosh.  And so he's breathing like, because I remember when I was up there, I'd walked all these steps  all the way to the top and I didn't even run.  Owen ran.  As soon as he did that interview at the bottom of the building, he raced up, I don't know  how many flights of stairs and this ladder and all the way down the catwalk, all the  way to the clock.  And it's quite a bit ways and you know, I know the pressure, like the, you know, you're  breathing hard after running up there and you're nervous because the match is going to  start and you're hanging there.  The whole thing has got to be kind of scary looking and he's taking these deep breaths. 
[01:18:30]  I'm sure he's taking these deep breaths and it just, it was like, ping, and the lace released  him and the guy that was supposed to be watching was just, he was looking one way and he said  he looked over and he said he was halfway to the ring by then.  Oh my gosh.  How high was he when he actually fell?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't know.  I can't.  Arena.  I think it was about 80 feet.  How many?  75 feet?  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  75 to 80 feet.  I think it was 78 feet.  And what I heard that this caused a riff in your family, his death, like what, how does 
[01:19:00]  that happen?  Well, you come from a big family, you're going to get, you're going to get situations where  people get envious and you know, in my case, I think everybody thought that, that I'd sort  of been Vince's, Vince had made me a millionaire and I was a star and all that.  And I think in a lot of ways they thought that he, he could give them the same things  to their, to their husbands. 
[01:19:30]  And, and, uh, I think everyone kind of, some people sort of started to, um, look out for  themselves.  It was like, I don't want to get my husband a job because he can work for Vince and that  kind of thing.  And they were just kind of people, desperate people do desperate things sometimes.  And they, I don't think they, I'll never understand where some of them are coming from, but yeah,  it kind of, um, screwed up the whole family.  Have you gotten any, uh, flack from anybody you, you write about in the book?  Uh, anybody saying, you know, Jesus Christ, dude, what are you doing? 
[01:20:00]  No, I don't think so.  No.  Most people, most, most of the wrestlers that I kind of hope that might get back to me  haven't, I think either assume that a vast majority of them can't read.  Who would you like to get back to you?  Um, I would, I don't, I don't really care.  I mean, I didn't write it.  I wrote it without any restraints.  Like I hope some guys like maybe Undertaker and, uh, you know, Steve Austin will might call  me someday and say, Hey, I really liked your book. 
[01:20:30]  I like what you wrote.  Do you just kind of fall out of it when, when you get into, you get injured or something happens  that's a career ending in wrestling.  Is it like you're almost like an outcast in, in, in the business?  All of a sudden the phone calls stop.  You, you don't see anybody.  No, it's like you have one life as a wrestler on the road with the wrestlers.  And then the second you get hurt, you go back to this other world that you had and you  never hear from anybody.  You never see anybody.  Most of the poor wrestlers are on the road.  They're all still doing the grind kind of thing. 
[01:21:00]  You can't really call wrestlers up and bother them.  I've still got a lot of friends that are still wrestling, but they're  the ones that are still on the road.  You can't bother them on the road.  You can't bother when they get home for, for 48 hours.  It's like, you know what?  I'll, I'll call you someday when you're really done, you know, which never happens.  You never talk to anybody again.  Where are you at with Vince McMahon?  Um, that punch behind closed doors.  What was that?  A documentary?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'd, uh, you were, yeah, you, you had cameras following you around and, uh, Vince goes into 
[01:21:30]  a room and, uh, and you pretty much knocked them out.  Right.  Cause he walks out of the room with a black guy and he's staggering.  And I think he really, I, I, I, I saw this years ago, but he, he effed you over.  He was supposed to make you the champion or something in your hometown.  Well, you just, what it was, was like in wrestling, you're, you know, it's kind of pathetic, but  you're supposed to be a independent contractor.  Right.  And, uh, so you're in business for yourself.  And, um, I had all these, um, sort of protections in my contract to protect me. 
[01:22:00]  And, uh, basically they just decided they were, they just decided one day they weren't  going to pay me anymore.  And so I ended up being pushed out of the company.  And I think, I think what was expected was for me to, um, go back to WCW and see what  kind of offer they would give me.  And they would give me a real low ball offer.  Cause they gave me a really big offer over the, like the year before.  And I think they were kind of banking on that.  I wouldn't get the same offer again. 
[01:22:30]  But luckily for me, I did get the same offer and I ended up going.  So once I was leaving, after I kind of got pushed out and asked how Vince was actually  helping me negotiate and stuff like that, he was like my friend helping me and telling  me that I was the first guy that was the whole company was kind of going down the toilet and  he wanted to make sure that I was the first guy out and that I could get my contract set  before all this slew of wrestlers followed behind me.  Right.  Which was all a bunch of baloney.  But what I believe Vince and I was, I took the deal I had with WCW, but in that process 
[01:23:00]  of about a week of this whole thing sort of came down, they decided that as I was leaving  that they wanted to just tear me down as much as possible and just make sure I had as little  value when I went to that company that they could beat me and, uh, lower all my, my, just  lower everything for me.  Cause I think WCW was planning on a big, at the time, which never turned out, they were  going to use, use me to sort of open the door to Canada and make that one of their big  markets.  Right.  So there was a lot of, um, potential in me going there and it was just decided that they 
[01:23:30]  would, uh, so we, we talked it all out and, um, I had been in a situation with, uh, Sean  Michaels, Pat Robertson's friend.  And, uh, he, um, he, he, um, had a lot of problems with me over the, over the year.  And he said to me, not just a few weeks before that when we were talking that, um, under no  circumstance would he ever lose to me ever in a match. 
[01:24:00]  Um, and then after I had already walked up to him and said, I have no problem what we  do at survivor series.  If you, if you want to, if you're going to get the belt, it's not a big deal to me.  Cause we'd had a little fisty cuff about six months before that.  So anyway, I, I really had no problems doing anything with him.  But once he kind of disrespected me in the, in the dressing room, um, and said that to  me, I said, in the hell with this guy.  I'm not, I can play the same way.  I'm not, I'm never going to let him ever beat me.  And so when that happened and I, Vince had told me I could leave any way I wanted and 
[01:24:30]  I just stood by that.  I said, I'm not, I'll do anything you want, but I'm not losing that guy period ever, you  know?  And it was agreed that you were going to, you were going to win over Shawn Michaels.  You know, they agreed to, uh, sort of, uh, um, an ending to the match that would sort  of make everyone happy without you would go out as kind of a champion or whatever.  And you move on and, uh, I was in a funny situation in Canada where the way the thing  had been sort of, um, um, built up as I, as the, I was a pretty big Canadian hero at 
[01:25:00]  the time.  And, uh, it was a case of, I just didn't think it was the right thing for me to do.  It was just all, all about lowering my stock.  So I always look at it as a business decision.  I was sticking up for me at myself as a businessman.  Right.  And I had every right to do that.  And, uh, anyway, they just lied to me and then they kind of cheated me in the match.  Yeah.  They made sure that Shawn Michaels won for the people that don't, that know, that don't  know in front of a Canadian crowd.  Was it, uh, Calgary?  Montreal.  Montreal. 
[01:25:30]  And Brett was like, what the F?  This was, was not agreed upon ahead of time.  And, uh, you spit in, you spit in, uh, Vince's face and then behind closed doors, you, you  gave him a good one.  Well, you know, the truth about that is that, uh, Vince came and confronted.  He had me in the dressing room with, uh, I had told him to leave, you know, asked him  to leave.  I said, if he doesn't leave, he's going to get hurt.  And, uh, he stood there in the dressing room with, uh, I don't know, three or four sort  of henchmen behind him.  And I had Neidhart and, uh, Davey and Owen and Rick Rude was in there and Undertaker. 
[01:26:00]  Shawn was sitting in the corner and you'll read in the book, he was bawling his eyes out  the whole time.  He never stopped blubbering the whole time.  The whole thing happened.  And why was he blubbering?  He was scared to death.  Okay.  And he was going to, he was such a little coward anyway.  But, uh, anyway, I, I told Vince that, uh, it's funny cause I came out of the shower.  I was naked at the time and, uh, bulldog used to always steal my towel.  So I came out naked, dripping of water, no towel. 
[01:26:30]  And I finally see Vince.  I walked past him.  I remember about the same distance you and me are.  Yeah.  And I thought, if they ever do a movie on this, I don't want to have to have some actor  doing this naked, you know?  So I went and got a towel and sat down and we had this little conversation and I told  him, I said, if you don't, as soon as I get dressed, as soon as I get my shoes on, if  you're still here, I said, I'm going to knock you out.  And I remember putting all my clothes on and remember tying my last shoelace and I'm thinking  as soon as I tied it, I thought, it's showtime. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  It's like, he's not going anywhere.  And I'm, I'm mad enough that I think I'm going to give him what he deserves.  And it was the most beautiful thing I ever did in my whole life.  How did this feel?  I broke my hand.  You broke your hand punching him?  I hit him with an uppercut that, uh, would have made that one that Buster Douglas gave Mike  Tyson.  Uh, I, it was a beautiful punch in the whole world.  I mean, it was just really perfect.  Like, symmetrically, I got a really nice twist into it.  Came straight up like a Popeye cartoon. 
[01:27:30]  I'm surprised he didn't hit his head on the ceiling.  And, uh, he came down and rolled his ankle when he landed.  He almost broke his ankle and I hit him in the jaw.  That's how he got the black eye.  It wasn't like I hit him right in the face or anything.  I only hit him one time.  Yeah.  Cause he, he staggered out of there.  He was out cold for about two minutes.  Wow.  Flat on the ground with it, like a star.  Just boom.  He's a big bastard too.  Vince is not small.  No.  No.  But he went down hard.  You know.  Wow.  And, uh, you know, that's, that's all in the book, you know, but I, I, um, I still think 
[01:28:00]  it was the smartest thing I ever did and the right thing to do.  And, uh, maybe it taught them that, uh, to do that kind.  Did his boys jump on you after that or?  Well, they kind of, I, like I've expected, it was a bit of a little, everyone, like a  pull apart.  That's why I went with the uppercut.  Right.  If I had gone with the overhand right, they would have just hooked my arm and that would  have, we would have just had a little, like in wrestling where they jump on you and every  day.  You wanted to land the punch.  I wanted to kill him.  Damn it. 
[01:28:30]  Why wouldn't you just leave if someone's having to knock you out?  Why wouldn't you wait till the second shoe is going on and go, all right, I'll talk  to you later and then leave?  Well, it's not like Vince is built like Sam, you know, these guys, you know, they're not  going to back down too often.  Wow.  Well, Brett.  He's going wild with his break sign.  Yeah, we have to break and he has other press to do.  But this book, it was out in Canada a few years ago, right?  No, one year ago.  A year ago.  Okay.  Now it's hitting the States.  Yeah.  And Sam says, I will read this because I've read a few of the wrestling books over the  years, but Sam says this is the best one that's come out thus far. 
[01:29:00]  It took me seven years to write it all by myself and I wrote that through a stroke and I wrote  it through the concussion and I wrote it through a lot of tragedy, but I wrote it right from  the heart and I hope everybody likes it.  And you obviously don't hold back.  So we've only touched the surface on the stories that are in this book, Hitman.  Yeah.  Brett Hart, a pleasure.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to take a quick break and continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:29:30]  Young Gregory is chewing and Anthony is putting his headphones on.  I'm Jim Norton.  We have to promote, Brett's got a couple of signings.  We want to promote book signings.  Today, Friday, 1 p.m.  He's at Borders Books, which is 100 Broadway.  It's down on Wall Street.  So it's a good time, you know, at lunch, you go out and get a book real quick.  He'll sign it for you.  And tomorrow, 11 a.m., it's a place I've done.  It's Bookends in Ridgewood, New Jersey, which is a great independent bookstore out in Ridgewood 
[01:30:00]  if you don't feel like dealing with city traffic.  And 4 p.m. at Borders in Bridgewater.  He's doing a lot, but, you know, he's a wrestler.  He'll draw a lot more people than I do.  So today, 1 o'clock Borders on Broadway at 1 o'clock.  Tomorrow, 11 in the morning, Bookends in Ridgewood, and 4 p.m., Borders, Bridgewater.  So I'll do all that, folks.  There you go.  That guy has seen a lot, this Bret Hart.  There was no one bigger for a very long time in wrestling.  Wow, he has a story to tell, and he's telling it with this book.  And we take pride in the fact that we screwed over Channel 11. 
[01:30:30]  He was supposed to be on Channel 11 about a half hour ago here in New York.  Whoopsie.  They're giving us all sorts of signs.  They're like, we're going to hang out with Bret Hart, and when we're ready to end, we'll end.  Yeah.  You know, we're not going to cut off his story about punching out Vince McMahon.  That's unbelievable.  He knew.  I could sense, Bret knew by looking at me, that he was just to do as we instructed.  Yeah.  Dude, he's a frightening guy, man. 
[01:31:00]  He is very frightening.  Quiet, and he's not trying to be intimidating.  That's what's scary about him.  He's a quiet, nice dude.  Oh, would I not want his fist in my face?  No.  Everyone was saying that he could snap like that, and people are like, Anthony, do the  angry fist.  Do angry fist.  I'm like, I don't think the comedy portion of this is really going to shine through.  And you don't want to spend the weekend in a hospital somewhere.  Yeah.  The weekend?  If he hit Anthony?  Sorry.  Well, I'm sorry.  Forget about the weekend.  Yeah, I'm going to be back Monday, all chipper. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, well, I got punched.  I'm all right now.  Yeah, good point.  Until year's end.  That's right, babe.  Jingle bells.  Jingle bells.  Just coming out of my coma.  Yeah.  Will in Jersey has something.  Will?  Hey, boys.  How we doing?  Pretty good, Will.  I just thought that Brett was dead from the WWF days.  I'd like to hear his voice.  You thought he was actually dead?  Yeah, I did.  That was a long time ago.  Yeah, Goldberg kicked this guy, and next thing you know, he just disappeared. 
[01:32:00]  He was done.  He said he wrestled for a couple more weeks, and then it was over after that.  He knyled his brain against his skull.  You should see the kick on YouTube.  It's disturbing.  And he didn't kick him in the back of the head.  I don't think Brett really remembers it, unless that's another kick.  I think it's just a bad angle.  I think what happened was, it looks like he got hit flush in the front of his head,  but I think his foot actually kind of went around and caught him in the side slash back of the head.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow, wow. 
[01:32:30]  It's just a nasty-ass thing to be in.  They really do.  It's like, you know, obviously they know who's going to win the match, for the most part.  Who knows these days?  But they are really literally killing each other by doing this.  Yeah, look.  It hit him kind of on the side back.  And the back of his head smashed into the mat.  Oh, that's probably what happened, what he meant by that.  I think he really did take most of the kick in the front, but then he slammed right back onto the mat. 
[01:33:00]  I wonder if Goldberg knew right there that he screwed up and really connected.  Well, he was watching him get up.  Goldberg's standing in the corner of the ring after they kick him, and he waits for him to get up.  Oh, yeah, he waits for him to get up and then slams him back down again.  Holy Jesus.  He had a concussion, and he slammed him back on his head.  Well, Goldberg was also notoriously known for working kind of stiff and injuring a lot of the guys.  Really?  He wrestled, yeah.  Because he wasn't a professional wrestler.  He played college football and was just a huge, ridiculous human being that they figured would work well in wrestling. 
[01:33:30]  So he really didn't know what he was doing for the most part.  They taught him a few moves, and his big one was to tackle guys because that's what he knows how to do.  Give me the concussion, Jewel.  Did he still wrestle?  Goldberg?  No.  I think he's been done for a while.  He's done.  I think he tried to play football.  I think he went back, and he was trying to make it in the NFL.  He made it to someone's training camp, and then he was cut, right, Sam?  Am I accurate on that one? 
[01:34:00]  No, Sam knows.  I think Brock Lesnar tried to do that.  Goldberg was trying to do play-by-play for Elite XC MMA for a while, and he was not good.  So where's Goldberg now?  He's not doing anything right now.  I mean, I think that TNA has talked to him about wrestling a couple times, but his paycheck is very high, and he doesn't want to sign for, like, a long time.  So he's not doing anything right now.  All right.  And Stump Brain wrote this.  Some stroke victims sound very calm because they lose the connection to their emotions. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah.  It was kind of sad.  Turned into a Vulcan?  It was kind of sad to see Bret Hart like that.  He was very...  He said, like, when he had the stroke and while he was recovering and everything, he would just cry every day for no reason.  Like, he cried all the time.  Like, he had no control over his emotions anymore.  Wow.  Well, you see these guys on TV, and then they just kind of go away, and you don't really pay attention to them going away.  Yeah.  And they're living, like, some of these guys are in hell.  Yeah.  Right? 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, that was kind of like, wow.  He was a little dodgy.  But he had gone through so much, even without being a stroke victim.  Like, he was kind of obsessed with wrestling, and the business had screwed him over so many times.  And he still, like, in his book, he was talking about how one of his biggest fears was that people would just forget about him.  And so, like, even though he doesn't like Vince McMahon, he had to go back and work for him so they could do the DVD so people won't forget about him and all this stuff. 
[01:35:30]  It's just such a weird business to be in.  It's like, oh, fun and games, and let's watch the guys roll.  So, and then you realize how many of these guys are dead or paralyzed or just, like, effed up in life?  There should be some kind of, I don't know, oversight.  They really are just.  They need a union.  Yeah.  Unionize the wrestlers.  Jesse Ventura tried that.  Of course he did.  And then he got fired.  Did he?  Yeah.  Is that why they fired him? 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  Well, I think that everyone should have representation.  I'm sure you do.  I'm just getting stunned from that whole interview.  Yeah, it was kind of weird.  Yeah.  A little depressing.  Yeah.  He's, uh, I wish him nothing but the best, man.  He's open, though.  Yeah, he did.  But he's obviously effed up.  He's obviously, you know, screwed up.  It's kind of like when you started seeing Muhammad Ali losing it.  It kind of really depressed you because you remember him just being so animated and, you 
[01:36:30]  know, just doing his thing.  You just shake his hand and kind of looked at him and his eyes were somewhere else, you  know?  It kind of was just.  Well, I was talking and he was looking elsewhere trying to find out where the voice was coming  from.  I was like.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  He was looking at me a lot while he spoke just because we're in my line.  Oh, you're cute.  I think so, too.  But he was an intimidating guy, even though he was being nice.  He wasn't trying to be.  But just when he's looking in the eye, you're like, I want to make sure that I look pleasant  and I don't want to look like I have anything on my mind but pleasant. 
[01:37:00]  I was just thinking flowers.  Don't show fear.  He can smell it.  He knows I have fear.  I was just thinking unicorns, unicorns, unicorns, cake, unicorns.  He's still in ridiculous shape, so I guess, you know, he's spending his time at a  gym or something.  Yeah.  That whole Vince McMahon story is amazing.  What's the name of that documentary if people want to search it out?  It's Wrestling with Shadows.  Wrestling with Shadows, yeah.  And it kind of just follows him through his last year in WWE.  Yeah.  You can't really wrestle a shadow.  I mean, it's not really a solid audience.  You know what I mean?  Literal Jim. 
[01:37:30]  Thank you, Opie.  All right.  Anthony dropped the proverbial ball.  I did.  Yeah, well.  I was agreeing with you.  I was being literal ant.  Just agreeing with literal Jim and literally sucking.  Well, you know what?  We're going to bring everyone back now.  Oh, thank goodness.  What are we doing?  It is Friday.  We've got to bring everyone back.  I enjoyed that, though.  He was very, very old.  He was great.  I think we're going to do this.  It's time for Kosher Sports. 
[01:38:00]  Oh.  We're going to move out of the way.  Our host, Intern David.  That's right.  Here comes Intern David to do Kosher Sports.  Favorite sports Jew.  And this is just like wrestling.  It looks like Club Soda Kenny is Intern Dave's handler.  Are you his manager, Club Soda?  Whatever it takes, GH.  I hear he's very hard to work with.  Yeah, he's a little bit of a prima donna, but we'll whip him into shape for you.  Kenny, what happened in the office this morning when David came running in? 
[01:38:30]  It looked like he wanted to tell Opie something, and you could shoot him away.  Yes, I had to shush David.  Yeah, what happened?  Because David looked a little agitated.  Well, dude, David's not used to the routine yet.  Oh, he isn't?  No.  So you were ready to approach GH with something to say, David?  I'm not sure what you're talking about, to be honest.  Do you remember this morning?  Do you remember this morning in the office when you went over to Opie's desk and Club Soda 
[01:39:00]  Kenny kind of made you leave the office?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  What happened there?  I don't think I wanted to talk to Opie at all.  I was busy trying, I wanted to talk to Kenny, but he was busy in there, so I wasn't allowed  in the room.  But you looked like you were in a tizzy.  I was a little bit.  Yeah?  Why?  I don't know.  I was just confused.  What was the problem?  Nothing.  Like, Kenny can't, like, my book, my notebook and my jacket were in there, and Kenny, like,  said, is this your stuff?  And he brought in, threw it on the couch, and I was just all confused.  Oh, so that confused you. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  That's not what it was.  So how was, what was the holiday now?  What was the last?  Yom Kippur, right?  Correct.  Yom Kippur.  That was yesterday.  It actually started on sundown, went from sundown Wednesday night to sundown Thursday  night.  Just one day?  Yep.  And what is that, what is that?  Yom Kippur is a day of repentance.  And what did you do to repentance?  I fasted.  You fasted?  Yeah.  All Jews do.  From sundown Wednesday to sundown Thursday, no food or drink. 
[01:40:00]  None at all?  None at all for the whole entire day.  What's with the suffering with you people?  That's the whole point of the holiday.  They're supposed to suffer and repent for their sins.  Oh, do you feel you repented?  I repented.  I went to temple and repented to God.  Oh, you did?  Yes.  Well, your God.  Yeah.  Anything you could tell us?  What did you atone for?  Just some mistakes that I made and stuff.  On the radio show?  Did you atone for what you did on the radio?  I certainly did.  You did?  I did.  And just not eating fixes all that? 
[01:40:30]  And maybe some penicillin?  No, nothing.  No medicines.  No eating, drinking.  All right, literal David.  Not even one sip of water.  Nothing?  No.  How about just a sucking candy?  Not even a sucking candy.  Nothing?  No.  Just a bunch of Jewish people with growling stomachs.  Correct.  That's pretty much what the holiday's about.  Hey, you know, I don't understand my own faith, but I certainly don't understand yours.  Like, what if you're, like, a good Jew?  Like, you're living your life perfect.  Why would you have to, like, do all this crap?  Well, can't you be the one guy that says, look, I have nothing to atone for. 
[01:41:00]  I've done nothing but the right thing my entire life.  I'm not partaking.  I'm going to have a coffee cake.  Right.  A coffee cake.  Whoa.  Whoa.  It's not kosher.  Why don't you just eat?  Then you're not going to go to, like, Jewish hell, would you?  If you ate on that day?  Yeah, that's a bad.  That's not...  That's also called Anthony's house.  David, answer my question, though.  What if you're a good Jew and you feel like I have nothing to atone for, so I'm not going to fast. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, you're saying, what if there's one Jew that had not one sin the whole entire year?  Right, right.  Why do you have to go through the process?  Maybe they're going to repent for other people and they're going to...  It's a team sport kind of thing, then, you're saying.  I think so.  I've got to say, the older I get, organized religion just doesn't make sense to me.  There's a lot of wacky rules.  It's just a lot of stupid stuff.  Yeah.  Do you guys have any fun holidays that isn't based around suffering and remembering suffering? 
[01:42:00]  We have fun holidays.  What's one of your fun ones?  Hanukkah is a fun holiday.  Hanukkah is...  He stole that from us.  But that's...  What's fun about spinning a little of the dreidel?  Spinning a dreidel is fun.  Getting presents is fun.  Yeah, but you don't get...  You get...  Not like Christmas, right?  It's like one a day for...  You get...  Okay, it's not me.  No?  You get a bunch of...  Not in my family.  I just get one...  I just get presents all in one day.  Are you jealous of, like, Christmas trees?  No.  In the house? 
[01:42:30]  No.  Come on, they look cool.  The lights, tinsel...  No, wait.  We have lights.  We don't have trees, but we have lights.  What?  Yeah, they got Hanukkah bushes.  A menorah.  And Hanukkah bushes.  Yeah, but that's...  There's no Hanukkah bush.  That was a rumor.  Wasn't that...  Isn't that an urban legend?  It is.  That's made up.  But there's a menorah which has the light.  A menorah, but that...  Yes, of course it has the lights.  And that represents the oil that burned for a lot longer than...  Right, the Jews thought the oil was only going to last for one day, but it was a miracle  and it only ended up lasting for eight...  And it ended up lasting for eight days.  For eight days. 
[01:43:00]  How is that a miracle?  Because they thought it was going to last for one day.  They didn't think they had enough oil for eight days.  You know, I had a miracle, too, because I checked my oil in my  tank and I was like, there's no way this is going to last a week.  And it lasted a week.  Where's your yarmulke?  And it was a miracle.  Where's your yarmulke?  Because I had the heat on to heat my house, the high ceilings.  Oof.  Jeez, oy vey, let me tell you.  But David, was that a miracle or just a couple of people who did terrible mathematical calculations?  On oil consumption.  It was a miracle.  Maybe it was somebody who just...  Maybe there was actually 10 days of oil worth, but somebody did not know how to use oil, 
[01:43:30]  so they burned it and only got eight days out of it because their calculations were off.  They basically got ripped off.  Yeah, basically, Jimmy's saying that your religion is based on a guy that didn't know  how to do math right.  Yes.  How does that make you feel?  We're just that part of it.  I don't think so.  I don't think a lot of people knew how to do all those calculations back then.  All right, all right, whatever.  I think a lot of Jewish guys...  How do I hate this guy?  I think a lot of Jewish people...  I think he's the greatest.  Jewish people that I went to school with and stuff always seemed a little envious of Christmas  because, I don't know, the whole holiday spirit thing and the Christmas tree, the decorations 
[01:44:00]  around the house, very Christmassy, and you guys just had like a candelabra.  It just seemed like, wow, that's kind of...  I always felt bad.  There's no reason to feel bad.  Okay.  I heard that you guys saw us all having fun and there was really no actual holiday  and you guys came up with some obscure thing to partake in the fun that us Catholics do.  No, that's not true.  I've heard that over and over again.  Well, there are some Jews that feel a little disappointed, you know, but it's all about 
[01:44:30]  remembering the oil.  Remembering the oil.  We remember baby Jesus.  Yes, you do.  And you remember oil.  Yep.  That's great.  It was a miracle because the Jews thought they were going to be in the dark for all this  time and they wouldn't be able to see.  Is that all it was?  Is it like you'd be in the dark for a few days?  Yeah, because it was a big destruction.  It was the destruction of the temple and the destruction of the temple and they thought  that there was only enough oil left and it would be in the dark.  What about the next morning?  Yeah.  Because the Jews didn't live in Alaska.  They thought that the oil was going to die out and wasn't going to burn on it. 
[01:45:00]  I got that.  I got that.  But why didn't...  I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Why didn't the next morning when the light would come from the sun, why wouldn't  you be able to see that and work on the temple?  And then you blow out the candle or the lamp.  Yeah.  And then you save the oil for when it gets dark again.  Yeah, what are you doing?  David.  That's a really good point.  But I love...  I love how...  It's totally making him lose his faith.  No, but I love how you're pointing out how ridiculous that story is. 
[01:45:30]  But our story of...  That's a really good point.  The baby Jesus being born to our virgin mother is completely sane.  Of course she was a virgin.  And then the little Jesus was born, and then they brought the frankincense and myrrh and  all that fun stuff.  We celebrate baby Jesus, and he celebrates oil.  We had a little drummer boy, too.  You don't have that, right?  No, we definitely don't.  You know, the little bastard had no gift to give, so he gave a song.  He could have given them the drum.  That's right.  If you could really think about it.  The ox and lamb were tapping their feet, but they really weren't.  They were just stepping in their own feces, and Mary's like, oh, look, they're keeping 
[01:46:00]  time.  No, they're not, Mary.  They're oxes and lambs.  They're not enjoying the little kid banging on his drum like Bobby Brady.  They're just kind of restlessly walking in a pen.  They want to escape.  They want to get out.  Keeping time.  Ox and a lamb just kind of standing there stupidly.  Ox and lamb keeping time.  Get out of here.  The lamb is eyeing up that mint jelly, and he knows he's in trouble.  Stinky metronome.  So, David, when you pray, can I ask you?  You pray, right?  You can ask. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, thanks.  Thank you, David.  I appreciate that.  You're welcome.  It'll all be done if it wasn't for my son, David.  Yes.  What do you, how do you start a prayer when you start to pray?  What do you say?  Oh, there's a lot of prayers.  It's all in Hebrew.  Well, okay.  I'm asking you.  I don't know.  How would it do that?  I don't have my own specific prayers.  There's just like, there's a book that you read all the prayers from, and I just read  what it says in the book.  Is that the Torah?  No, the Torah is different.  Oh, I have no idea.  The Torah, you read from the Torah, too, but Torah is actually what it says is the Bible. 
[01:47:00]  Oh.  The Torah is the Old Testament, so word for word is the Bible.  What's the name of your God?  Just, uh...  Just God?  Yeah.  Like Jehovah, like that.  Oh, okay.  You know what Jehovah's Witness is?  Yes.  That's what it is.  Jehovah.  That's our God.  So Jehovah's your God.  How are you tied in with Jehovah's Witnesses?  We're not tied in.  I'm just saying, like, that's what it is.  That's what our God is.  See, we have God, but then we have Jesus.  And, you know what's great about...  We have two, like...  Yeah, we only have one.  We have a president and a vice president. 
[01:47:30]  We don't have that.  And the Holy Spirit was the Speaker of the House type thing.  Yes, yeah.  We don't have that either.  Just one president, that's all.  That's it.  What's great about David, everybody that is Jewish is calling the show going,  Holy crap, this guy's getting everything wrong.  Yeah, I'm a rabbi.  David's wrong.  David is wrong.  Everyone drives them nuts out there.  You get the rabbi on the phone?  I'm sure you would know.  Let's get Rabbi Jeff on the phone.  What exactly am I wrong about?  Everything, according to the listeners.  Rabbi Jeff, what do you got?  Hey, how you doing?  I'm fine, but David is desecrating my religion. 
[01:48:00]  Right now.  Desecrating your religion.  Okay, how?  First of all, Yom Kippur is to atone for the sins of the individual and of the jury as a whole.  So, if you know how many sins, you still pray,  because someone who didn't have sins and didn't want to pray wouldn't actually be a righteous person.  But forget about that.  Hanukkah is not to remember the oil.  Hanukkah is to remember the Jews who were masked by the Greeks.  They destroyed the Jewish temple.  And it was a thing then to light the Manoah every single day. 
[01:48:30]  He tied the Manoah with a fresh bottle of oil.  And there was no oil left because all the oil was spilled out by the Greeks.  So, like, the small token, remember, and so we have, you know, to remember the miracle that God performed,  everything was destroyed, but he made the bottle of oil last for eight days instead of one day.  Can I ask you something?  Wouldn't a real miracle have been to have this stuff not be destroyed?  Yeah, that would have been a real miracle.  I mean, it would have been a real miracle.  Like, why wouldn't God...  David's laughing again. 
[01:49:00]  That's hilarious.  Why wouldn't God just, you know, instead of giving him more oil around all this destruction,  just, like, avert the destruction?  Yeah, stop the massacre.  Yeah, I don't know.  If every Jew would ask these questions, I know who would be Jewish.  Yeah, that's some wacky...  Well, that's a problem.  We're all scared to ask questions.  We just want to believe these fairy tales that they tell us every Sunday.  You can't question religions.  People get very sensitive.  Oh, boy, do they.  Go see religious. 
[01:49:30]  It's sensitive.  God's name is Hashem, by the way.  Hashem?  Hashem is a Hebrew.  Isn't it Hebrew?  Hashem?  Right.  Hashem is a name we call God, not Jehovah.  It is that.  It is.  Yes, it is.  Wasn't that that I dream of Jeannie's double or something?  David got it totally wrong.  It's like, what do you call God?  David went, Jesus.  Hashem is a name in Hebrew.  Jesus.  No, you guys have X, May, on the easiest, Jay, right?  Hey, Ann, I like your line there, by the way.  Thank you.  Yes, I appreciate the I dream of Jeannie thing.  Very, very clever.  David, let me ask you, before the rabbi answers, who is Jesus to you? 
[01:50:00]  I'm asking David.  I want to see if David has the right answer.  Who is Jesus to me?  Like, how do you, as a Jewish guy, look at Jesus?  I just look at Jesus as another figure, as just the son of God.  Oh, well, just another son of God.  Yeah.  He's the competition, David.  Correct.  If you look at him like the son of God, Jews don't believe that.  He's the competition, and your people killed him.  Correct.  Well, you know.  Well, the Romans.  The Romans, but they were egged on a little. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  They sure were, Ann.  David, is that a rabbi?  He's just a guy.  Yeah, that's all.  Right.  Rabbi?  Is that right?  No, that man is right.  Jesus was a Jew, and we think of him as a false prophet.  We don't think he's a son of God.  What?  We don't think he's a son of God.  How dare you?  A false prophet?  False prophet.  Whoa, whoa.  David thinks you're full of bunk.  David's arguing with the rabbi.  Yeah.  Sounds like my Citadel stock.  False prophet.  Oh, David. 
[01:51:00]  David, David, David.  You're supposed to educate us on your religion.  I'm no rabbi.  Well, obviously.  You're not even Jewish.  You're Jewish either.  You're barely Jewish now.  He's David the Mick.  He's an Irish kid that wandered in with glasses.  So, David, you're arguing with the rabbi.  You say the rabbi's wrong.  So, you acknowledge Jesus in a way that the Jews are not supposed to.  You called Jesus the son of God.  That's what he is.  He's a false prophet. 
[01:51:30]  No, that's according to your faith.  The Jews do not believe that at all.  Rabbi, is that totally wrong?  A hundred percent.  David's what we call apichorus.  He's someone who doesn't really, who gives false attribution to apichorus.  Apichorus?  Apichorus?  I've said that many times about him.  Yeah, he's apichorus.  What the heck does that mean?  Apichorus.  It means you're shunned now from the Jewish religion.  Oh, okay.  Exactly.  You must leave.  And David just...  Cast you out.  David just belligerently said, well, that's who he was.  Christ, the son of God. 
[01:52:00]  Like, the rabbi said, no, that's not who he was at all.  He was a false prophet.  And you're saying what?  False prophet?  Yeah, what the hell, right?  Yeah, sure.  Get off your chest.  And he also thinks it's Jehovah.  That's wonderful.  It is.  That would be making the Jewish people very happy.  That's what the literal name of God, it is.  In English, the literal name in vain, it is.  Hashem is just what you say in Hebrew.  When you're not saying God's name in vain, you say Hashem.  Yeah.  But that's how we refer to God, though.  Correct.  But watch how you spell Jehovah, because when you're stepping on those stones that spell 
[01:52:30]  out Jehovah, you have to do the right spelling or you'll fall through and die.  Okay.  I heard Danny laugh.  I don't even have to turn around.  I know he gets my movie reference.  I don't know what that means.  No, I'm not car crashing Indiana Jones.  Oh, David, David.  All right, so David has it right, and I guess the rabbi is incorrect.  Yeah, rabbi, sorry.  Sorry, rabbi.  Yeah, I guess David knows that.  There is the word Hashem, but that's not, if you want to say the literal name, that's 
[01:53:00]  just like a sub-name, because you can't say God's name in vain whenever you want to.  It's not pronounced Jehovah.  It's not pronounced Jehovah.  In English, it is.  In English, it is.  He's a rabbi, David.  Yeah, you're arguing in the Jewish religion with a rabbi.  You're a kid just trying to get into broadcasting.  That's a guy that studies this stuff.  You're just trying to run the business.  Right.  He's square.  I'm trying to run broadcasting.  That is true.  I'm not trying to run Judaism.  I'm trying to run broadcasting.  That is true.  One more thing, by the way.  What else am I wrong about?  Yes, rabbi?  I did tape Little Jimmy's show, because I couldn't watch it on Friday night, obviously, and it's 
[01:53:30]  fantastic.  Oh, thank you very much.  Hey, man who knows Judaism and comedy.  Thank you, rabbi.  Wait, you were able to set your DVR?  Yeah, I did.  I set my DVR on the Sabbath.  But then you couldn't, but you set it before the Sabbath, right?  Yeah, of course.  Sure.  That means you did.  But the machine runs by itself.  Can't you just set everything on a remote and have, like, your coffee maker running and  everything else on the Sabbath, and that way? 
[01:54:00]  Technically, actually, it's a bit of a serious question.  Technically, you actually could, but it's like the leather wall, spirit wall type of deal,  where people have air conditioning, and they can't turn that on on the Sabbath, but they  have it set before the Sabbath so that it goes on.  You found loopholes.  Yeah, that's cheating.  You found loopholes.  Do you think God's going to go, oh, I almost had him?  Yeah, that's cheating.  But he figured out a workaround.  Like, you'd have to sit with God with a DVR instruction manual and say, no, no, no,  look.  Look, God.  You can preset it.  God's so old, he just doesn't understand the new electronics.  It's all about suffering. 
[01:54:30]  You're not suffering if you're setting this stuff ahead of time.  Why is a rabbi listening to the Opie and Anthony show?  I need to ask.  We are very diverse.  We're a diverse program.  I hate to do this, but the rabbi will understand.  We've got to pay some bills by taking a break.  You know, sponsors and money, things like that.  Money.  Thank you for your time, guys.  I appreciate it.  Thank you, rabbi, sir.  Rabbi Jeff.  I love how David just gets everything wrong.  And then we have Jewish, they call up and correct you. 
[01:55:00]  It drives him nuts, Anthony.  The phones, everything he says about the faith is wrong.  But he looks like he would know everything about the Jewish faith.  He sure does.  He's too stiff, though.  He doesn't bend when he talks, which means he's a psychopath.  David doesn't bend at all when he talks.  He's a loon.  David's a kook.  He's perfect, though.  We should send him out to Hollywood.  I mean, you want to talk about typecasting.  Look at this kid.  Yeah.  Look at him.  I think David rules.  I really do.  David's the greatest.  What else is calling up?  What else is they disagree with? 
[01:55:30]  Oh, David rules.  Now on, it turns David show up.  Hey, let's take two calls here.  Ignore the fact that Anthony called for a break.  It's your show, David.  Yeah, go ahead.  Dave says, the hell with Anthony.  Call her.  You're on the air.  Yeah, well, how about we'll take a few calls after the break?  Is that okay with you?  That is fine.  You, you, you, you.  She's starting small by just running our show.  Yeah, no kidding.  And before you know it, it's the whole broadcasting industry.  All right, more with intern David and kosher sports after the break?  After the break.  I hear you're very difficult. 
[01:56:00]  He is difficult to work with.  Yeah, he is.  That's what Kenny and everyone's saying.  It's a pain in the ass.  We wanted to do this over an hour ago, but David was like, you know.  He's a perfectionist.  He's a, he's a, fill in the blank, Opie and Anthony.  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show in the middle of talking to intern David,  who I believe, I'm not really sure at this point, is of the Jewish faith.  Yes.  I noticed your stepfather there, Sal, had a problem with David.  He came a talking to you during the break, right, Sal? 
[01:56:30]  Well, Sal was, Sal was an artificial Jew for a little while.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Sal, for marriage purposes, converted.  He actually denounced Jesus, said, yeah, it wasn't Jesus, it wasn't the Son of God, denounced  his religion, and went Jew for a little while.  Well, you got to do that for pussy.  I mean, Jesus.  And then, of course, when that didn't pan out, we all know how that is, Sal, then he 
[01:57:00]  had to go back to the Catholic Church and go, hey, you know, it's like this.  I was just trying to get a little, I convert and stuff.  And the Catholic religion, they're very forgiving, as long as you open up your wallet and give  the Vatican a few bucks, they'll let you back in the club.  It's nice.  Ah.  You could completely denounce Jesus. 
[01:57:30]  Did you have to actually say that?  Like, I denounce Jesus?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That's got to be, you know, whether you believe all that or not, that's got to be a moment  where you're like, well, if it is true, here's where I am burning in hell.  Yeah.  You know.  And God has to figure all this crap out when you get up there.  Yeah, it's like, well, you denounced Jesus.  Hey, I paid.  I paid.  I paid to get back in.  I'm back in the club.  You think God goes, okay.  Wouldn't it be funny if they're completely right in religion, and it is exactly as they 
[01:58:00]  say it is, and you're like, oh, what a bunch of nonsense, and then you get up there, like,  you're not coming in, you did not give the proper amount of donation to the Vatican,  and you're like, that was real?  That was real?  Yes.  This is all real?  Yeah.  How do you know what's real and what's not?  These gates are pearly, and you're not letting me in.  And you see gold streets behind and dead relatives, you're like, oh, I suck.  How did I get this wrong?  Now what?  You're just sitting there, now what?  Now what do I do?  Is there any way I can make up?  No.  It's eternity now that you're going to go to hell. 
[01:58:30]  You go to hell, and the devil gives you a pearly necklace.  For eternity.  Yeah.  All right, intern David.  I'll get out of the way so that people can view him.  Oh, you don't think we were talking to a real rabbi?  What?  Hold on.  Why would the mic work?  Yeah, what?  That guy was really a rabbi?  It sounded like it's awesome, just about everybody listening.  I wouldn't doubt it.  Yeah.  Okay.  You know.  He kind of knew a little more than you did, so I would say yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Okay.  Ready for kosher sports?  I'm ready when you guys are.  I'm ready when you guys are.  Wait a smoothly amend in the middle.  There's something going on here, too, because Kenny helps out with kosher sports, and you're  really frustrated by David, right?  We're trying something new.  Let's see how this works.  Oh, boy.  I know what this is all about.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  Go ahead, intern David. 
[01:59:30]  David.  It's time for kosher sports.  Oy vey.  Oy vey.  Yes.  Shalom.  This is BD Dave with your first kosher sports report of the Jewish New Year.  What year is it?  It's 5769.  Wow, we must have flying cars by now.  No?  Damn it.  All right.  Go ahead.  All right.  In baseball last night, the National League Championship Series started with the Phillies 
[02:00:00]  taking on the Los Angeles Dodgers.  This series is an East Coast versus West Coast rivalry, sort of like the rivalry between Israel  and Palestine.  In the game, the Phillies beat the Dodgers 3-2.  What was wrong with the Dodgers last night?  Maybe they were too busy fasting all day in observance of Yom Kippur.  Looks like the Dodgers will have to repent for their sin of losing last night and hope that  God hears their cries of sorrow and allows them to pull out a win in game two. 
[02:00:30]  What was the new thing you're trying?  The removal of all laughter and fun?  See, let me guess.  See if I can guess what the new thing is.  The new thing is, let him do everything.  So Kenny had nothing to do with this.  Is that it?  Let him finish.  David was probably too difficult to work with, so Kenny said, okay, do it yourself.  And this is what we're getting.  You'll be coming back to me.  David, you may continue, David.  Okay.  In other baseball news, the second playoff series starts tonight between the Boston Red 
[02:01:00]  Sox and the Tampa Bay Rays.  Oh, good for them.  That's pretty funny.  That's pretty funny.  Oh, good for them.  All right.  Well, let me take credit.  Did you see the difference between the first story and the second story?  Yes.  Set up, punchline, laugh.  First story, bored to tears.  All right.  So David did the second story.  Let's continue with kosher sports with intern David. 
[02:01:30]  In other sports news, we're going to turn to hockey because the hockey season has begun  and already there is a major controversy.  Tomorrow night is the home opener for the Philadelphia Flyers as they take on the New York Rangers.  And the ceremonial first puck is going to be dropped by vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.  The Flyers sure do have a lot of chutzpah using a hockey game to promote their political views.  That yenta of a hockey man Palin probably doesn't even know what hockey is. 
[02:02:00]  I bet she'll be dropping the puck out of her gefilte fish.  All right.  That was his.  With all this controversy, I hope another intifada doesn't start and there can be peace in the NHL.  That's good.  You should mention the Oslo agreement, too.  That'll get big laughs.  Yes.  Jesus.  People are asking, is he pausing because he's waiting for the laughs?  Yeah.  Hopefully it's shame swallowed.  Schindler's list was funnier.  And finally, as reported on the Opie and Anthony show, 
[02:02:30]  Bret Hart's wrestling career ended because a Jew kicked him in the head.  That probably hurt because his foot wasn't circumcised.  And this has been your kosher sports report with me, BD Dave.  You know, the kid with the big matzo balls.  That was his, too, right?  Wow.  BD, bad delivery, Dave.  All right, David.  Let me see.  Are the reviews coming?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, they are.  Are they good?  Oh, boy. 
[02:03:00]  Good reviews?  Why don't we turn off the screens?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  No?  No.  Bad reviews?  Yeah, the reviews aren't good.  Why?  They didn't like him.  I don't get it.  Are you sure?  This might be it for you, David.  Well, that's good, because now the bar is set so low for the next time.  Yeah.  You always got to think to the future.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  That's right, David.  All right, David. 
[02:03:30]  There it is.  Thank you.  Will you be over there at XM?  Yes, I will.  Sirius XM?  Yes, I will, of course.  All right.  You know, there's a big party thing going on.  Is there?  Tonight.  What's the party for?  Well, Lily is leaving.  We're on a Fez show.  And there's a party going on after that.  Anyone know where it is?  Yes, I actually do.  Oh, you do?  It's at Sweet Basil's in Queensbury, New York.  Tonight, that's where.  All the way up near Lake George? 
[02:04:00]  It's a really weird place.  Why?  The way the party is working is this.  We better leave now.  No, it's open for the public.  Yeah.  And, you know, I'll be performing, and public's allowed to come in and watch.  Really?  And then they do something for Lily at the end, I think.  What?  That's what I heard.  Okay, it's at McFadden's.  McFadden's here in New York City?  Or there.  Yeah.  I mean, whatever.  You want to fight about it?  Okay, maybe.  Who am I to say?  Maybe it is McFadden's.  Norton's going to be up there for everybody close to Lake George, so.  What's the place, Norton?  Queensbury, New York, Sweet Basil's Restaurant. 
[02:04:30]  Sweet Basil's.  Okay.  But the party is here in Manhattan.  Yes, and I'll be hanging out for the Ron and Fez show also.  Oh!  People are very excited when, you know, we do the crossover.  It's like the Jetsons and the Flintstones getting together.  All right, David.  Oh, I get a little laugh from David.  Goodbye, David.  Thank you.  All right, David.  Hey, I...  You don't be dead if it wasn't for my son, David.  Where's E-Rock?  Because E-Rock noticed Sal, like, just fawning over your grandchild.  Yeah.  We haven't even talked to Donnie today.  Donnie brought in Warren. 
[02:05:00]  E-Rock, what do you got on Sal?  Sal was in one of the back studios, and the baby had just woken up and was being fed.  And Sal goes, oh, my pumpkin.  My pumpkin's awake.  Look at E-Rock's impression of Sal.  That's not bad.  My little pumpkin.  My little pumpkin.  Someday we'll listen to Christmas Shoes.  And I kiss his schmeckle.  I kiss his schmeckle.  What?  Sal, get on mic with those great lines.  What are you doing?  Haven't learned anything from it. 
[02:05:30]  I kiss his little baby.  I kiss his schmeckle.  That's for, with the kid's name.  I forget his name.  David.  David.  That was for David.  He should know the word schmeckle.  Yeah, Sal knows a lot of those Yiddish words for when...  And what he didn't know was that Jesus was a rabbi.  Was he?  Until they nailed him.  He was a teacher.  Until they nailed him.  It's like they caught him doing something.  No, they literally...  Oh, on the cross.  Of course.  I remember my history.  So, the baby's here.  I know. 
[02:06:00]  I said hello.  Yeah.  And Donnie's here.  Yes.  Can we bring in the baby?  They're going to stay, and they're going to go to Ron and Fez.  They don't know about the party.  That may happen, too.  Well, bring in the baby to the bar.  That'll be nice.  Get him started early.  Well, they brought the baby to the radio station at like 4.30 in the morning.  Yeah, they were here.  Yeah.  All right.  Bring in the...  I want to see how uncomfortable Anthony gets.  They're bringing the baby.  They're bringing my second grandchild.  Yes.  That's right.  This is number two.  There he is. 
[02:06:30]  There comes Anthony's sister, Don.  Very cute.  Look how cute.  Look at the little...  Look.  He's yet to hold the baby.  It's Mr. Met.  Wait, Sal, he hasn't held the baby yet?  No, I don't hold babies.  I think Warren's almost three months old, Anthony.  I don't hold...  I don't hold the baby.  I don't hold the baby.  Warren's 27.  Look at Warren.  Warren's 27.  Look at those big eyes.  I like a baby named Warren.  I'm Warren.  It's time to hold the baby.  My name is Warren Dean.  It sounds like someone indicted on some kind of white-collar crime. 
[02:07:00]  Hello?  Want to hold him, Jimmy?  Um, all right.  Oh, jeez.  I'm kidding.  I'm good with baby.  And you gotta hold the baby.  Jimmy's gonna hold the baby.  Oh, that's good.  Oh, look.  Very cute.  Yeah.  Anthony, hold your nephew, will ya?  I hope it pukes on you.  What would be the first time?  Hello?  Good.  Do your little Uncle Paul impression now.  Oh, he's a good boy.  I don't want...  Someone move my mic.  I don't want to take my hand...  You don't want to unhand a baby. 
[02:07:30]  You want to hold him with two hands.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry that you have to see this creature behind me, young man.  That was E-Rock.  That's the E-Rock.  That's what happens if you're bad.  They put him in your stocking.  Smiling.  He knows.  Doesn't he have a big, round head?  He's very cute.  Yeah.  He's a good boy.  That's the C-section head.  Oh, is it?  He's got a C-section head, Dawn?  He's got a C-section head.  Didn't have to squeeze through?  It's perfectly round.  Well, something tells me it probably would have come out the same way if you had to do that,  too.  You know. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Come on, you're no kid.  I'm very popular with babies.  Oh, my God.  Why are you killing your sister?  I'm fooling, Dawny.  You know that.  I know you're tight as a drum.  All right.  He's a very happy baby.  Look how happy he is.  Hey.  But can you give the baby to Anthony?  No, that's okay.  You've got to hold your nephew.  All right.  Give me the little guy.  Come here.  Anthony has not held his own nephew.  The kid's like two and a half months old, I do believe.  Put my arms out.  This is how you're supposed to do it.  Look how. 
[02:08:30]  You're too stiff.  Is this how you do it?  You're too stiff.  Let me have the little guy.  Come here.  Come here.  I know his little head.  Hi, little baby.  Present the baby here, Ant.  Present the baby.  Present the baby.  The poor kid's miserable.  Look at him.  I know.  He's never smelled alcohol.  There you go.  Sure he has.  He's so cute.  Hello.  Look at you all.  The hustle and bustle.  Put him in the crook of your arm like Uncle Jim was doing.  No.  Yeah, like you hold him. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  So he's relaxed.  Okay, here we go.  You're as stiff as David.  Yeah, you're really stiff holding that kid, Anthony.  It's moving.  Yeah, it is.  Stop it.  I know.  Don't move so much.  And the kid's trying to say, like, hold my head, stupid.  Right.  I don't know.  Their heads are so big.  Yeah.  Why do they do that to kids?  They should be born, like, and just come out and go, hi.  I'm fine.  My head is fine.  You don't have to support it.  But what animal has a baby that can't support its own head?  We do.  That's silly.  Uh-oh, you're kicking me. 
[02:09:30]  The kid's trying to answer you.  What's the matter?  Look at you.  Everybody take it back.  Hey, wait.  Take it back.  It's starting to cry.  All right, yeah.  You didn't hold him right.  See, I was holding him.  He was laughing and smiling.  He felt the love when Jimmy was holding the baby, not the stiffness that you had.  Yeah.  Now, love.  Wow.  See how happy he is?  You hold him out like Superman.  That's not the way you hold a baby.  Sure it is.  Like Superman.  Yeah.  I know.  It's like Jimmy.  Oh, coochie, coochie.  It looks like Jimmy Sal said.  Jimmy's just a big baby.  Yeah.  Boy. 
[02:10:00]  That is great.  It does look like a Halloween costume.  Jimmy Norton.  It looks like a mini Jim Norton.  Yes.  Have him chase celebrities around.  Ask him for autographs.  Hello.  There you go.  Hello, little guy.  Well, there you go.  They just love me.  I'm very popular with babies.  Are you?  Yeah, they think I'm fantastic.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  We've got to get out of here.  That's very cute.  There you go.  He's a very cute baby.  I like that.  He's kind of cooking a little more than he was.  They look a little more human when they cook out of the womb for a while. 
[02:10:30]  That's got to be a cruel joke to have like a...  The babies, their heads are too big.  Yeah.  They should be born with little golf ball size heads to take care of the mother a little bit better.  You look very good, Dawn.  You lost a lot.  It's amazing.  You look great.  Oh, thank you.  I gained 60 and I've lost 40 so far.  Wow.  It's amazing.  Damn.  It's still another 20 to go.  20 to go.  Yeah, boy.  I was huge.  She was giant.  We really thought you had triplets or something in there. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dawn was so big.  I was like, hi, Dawn.  She's like, you know what, Dawn?  You were really, really big.  I broke my water, man.  Hold my umbilical cord.  We were all whispering and thinking, I think she might have multiple births in there.  Yeah.  There's something going on.  I remember asking at F.A. Trolley's, wow, you got to be, what, having the baby this weekend?  No, I got three and a half months to go.  All right, we got to get out of here.  I want to thank Sal for stopping by and a little Warren. 
[02:11:30]  Well, I'm going to XM, Sirius, wherever that is.  We'll have our live audience over there at SiriusXM.  Let's not forget about Jimmy.  HBO Tonight, Down and Dirty at the Bill Maher.  Midnight.  Yes, and Dice is on tonight and our own Jim Jeffries.  We'll be making, this is Jim Jeffries' show tonight.  And yes, foot.  Yeah, McGuire's tonight.  And tomorrow night in Bohemia.  McGuire's in Bohemia, Joseph T. Curry.  That's right.  Absolutely.  All right. 
[02:12:00]  Have a good weekend if you're not joining us for the rest of the show.  And even if you are.  Yeah.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Wow, another big crowd outside the Sirius XM Satellite radio studio.  Yes.  It's a very big day here on Satellite. 
[02:12:30]  We do the rest of our show.  Ron and Fez have the big party show.  Saying goodbye to Lily today.  Yes.  She's going on to bigger and better things than just, you know, being a flunky for a second-rate radio show.  So, she's got a big opportunity.  Certainly does.  It's a great opportunity.  Working with Brother Weez up there in Rochester, New York.  And for me, for all I, you know, care and everything like that, I just, I'm just in it for the party. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, I know.  You know.  I think we know that.  I'll be like, who's going where?  What?  Yeah, I know.  I know.  Get me another goddamn drink.  This is going to be, it's going to be a wild Ron and Fez show.  I think we're pretty much the warm-up show today.  I would think.  We're the warm-up show.  Everyone, I believe, is hanging out and going to have some fun there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, I was listening to their show yesterday, and apparently they had some germaphobe guy on. 
[02:13:30]  Some guy that's, you know, involved with their show that they're familiar with.  Right.  And they were taking the bathroom key and seeing if he would lick it.  And he was talking about how there's fecal matter all over it, and people urinate, use the key, and then they don't wash their hands.  They bring it back, which is true.  Which just goes to show you I'm not that crazy because I do touch the key.  Yeah.  But then they had people putting the key in their mouth and sucking on the bathroom key, which then led me to think, now I won't touch the key because it's been in people's mouths. 
[02:14:00]  I don't care if someone takes a dump, misses with their wipe, and the key smells like duty.  I would throw the key in my mouth.  Would you?  Yeah, I think I would.  Would you?  And I'm not just saying that for the radio.  Thank you.  Probably not the smartest thing.  Well, you put baby diaper shit on your upper lip, so.  You know what?  I feel like, in a way, like you and I are related, because people are saying, baby diaper mustache with Dawn's kid.  I'm like, that's like, I feel like there's some kind of, it's too close now. 
[02:14:30]  Baby diaper mustache with Dawn.  Well, now we're talking.  Period mustache.  Oh, God.  Period mustache with your sister.  Come on.  Who's with me?  You're getting in just under the wire, I think, as far as a period goes for her.  It'll be a dust mustache.  Obviously, she was able to have one, but I don't know.  You think she got it out just in time?  Just in a nick of time, that one.  You want to discuss that with your sister?  I think that could be fun. 
[02:15:00]  Little Dawny?  Yeah, Dawny and how the end is near.  Oh, come on.  She's not that old.  How is it?  Oh, my God.  She's 50.  No.  She's the young one, right?  She was the baby.  You're the middle child, obviously.  Yeah.  Middle child is just an attention-wanting, craving ass.  That's what I was my whole life.  Joe, my older brother Joe, was the firstborn older brother, so he was the one always kind  of in trouble, more outgoing, things like that. 
[02:15:30]  Dawn being the baby and the girl got spoiled rotten.  Just really spoiled brat.  Can we bring her in here for a minute or so?  Yeah, see if she's wandering.  She might be feeding a baby or something important like that.  I don't know.  And me, I was the middle kid who just wanted a little attention.  And I was always crying out for attention.  Literally crying out for attention.  And there. 
[02:16:00]  Sit down, Dawn, for a minute or two here.  Now, Ed, I snapped a picture of you and little Warren.  Yeah.  You were really happy holding the kid.  Really?  I captured some real happiness in your eyes.  I am such a great actor.  Nah, there's something that's blocking you for whatever reason.  But when it comes right down to it, you are all smiles.  You had a clisten in your eyes.  And even little Warren.  He's adorable.  You even gave him a loving pat on his head.  There is nothing cuter than a little baby head. 
[02:16:30]  Dawn, you make cute kids, man.  Thank you.  Unbelievable.  Yeah, he's got a big giant head, though.  You know what you do?  You go to kiss the top of their head, but then you go, you like suck in like a balloon animal  thing to their soft spot.  And you make it go up and then you're twisted into a little shape.  And then they have another little head on top of their head.  It's so cute.  No, it's kind of dented now.  What?  It's a little head?  It's a little off spot, just a little bit.  Hey, Dawny, why aren't you damaged like Anthony? 
[02:17:00]  Well, oh, what do you mean?  Like all bitter and have issues?  Yeah, with the spaghetti hitting the wall.  And, you know, we've heard the stories on the show.  Yeah, but he all went through it.  Everybody handles things differently.  I think Dawny was a little bit younger then, too.  Yeah.  Like, you know, and Joe was a little older, so he didn't care.  And I was more sensitive than both of you.  He's such a Jan Brady.  Oh, the middle child with all the issues.  I'm the middle child, and I'm going out with George Glass.  Yeah, middle child always just trying to get the attention that they never get. 
[02:17:30]  Is it true that Anthony cried a lot growing up, or is he making that up?  Oh, my God, yeah.  You know what?  He had such an issue with being called Tony.  Yeah.  If the song would come on, the name game, Tony, Tony, Boboni, he would just start crying.  I would start crying in the car.  Yeah, in the car.  That song.  Yeah.  The name game, Tony, Tony, Boboni, because these two jackasses, my brother and sister,  would point at me and go, Tony, Tony.  And I'm like, I'm not Tony, I'm Anthony. 
[02:18:00]  Oh, no, that's a perfect reason for a child to just blubber and start crying his eyes out,  because he doesn't like being called Tony.  I realize I was all screwed up.  I think you make a good point, because there's six, seven kids in my family, and I really believe  the last three had a lot easier, because I think the parents start getting tired, and  whatever issues they do have, they're like, ah.  Yeah, we don't care.  We don't care as much.  Well, it's like, too, after Joseph and Anthony, I was like, no matter what I did, it was nowhere 
[02:18:30]  near the stuff that they did.  Yeah.  You know, so, yeah, by the time it came around to me, nobody really cared.  I wasn't getting thrown out of school or anything.  And we discussed the Kumiya family, like, the dynamics have drastically changed, but you  guys were all about not having kids from you, Anthony, and Joe, and now two of you have  gone down in the last few months.  Yeah.  Changing everything, because Anthony was set on the air the other day, he doesn't like hanging  out with your mom or anybody, because...  Oh, it's all about the babies now. 
[02:19:00]  Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.  It's like, it's baby, baby, baby, baby, baby.  And then mom says, you know, hey, come on over.  So I go over, and she goes, I promise, we'll hang out, we'll talk, and stuff like that.  And she sits down to talk, and then she's like, oh, the babies, oh, no, I said I would  talk to you.  I said...  And then it becomes, it's like not, it's not like she's hanging out talking, it's like,  I will inconvenience myself by talking to you, Anthony, and not do what I really want  to do, which is dote over the children nonstop.  Yeah, she's out of control right now.  She's just insane. 
[02:19:30]  Well, she is.  Look at Sal.  Thumbs up.  Yeah, Sal comes up.  He's like, she's insane.  Yeah.  Sal's got his own problems with mom, because she only talks about the babies.  That's why I'm here by myself.  Yeah.  Sal's here by himself.  Yeah.  Because mom, you know, mom doesn't care about anything else, is what it is.  She doesn't want to know for anything else.  It's all about these babies now.  That's it.  Sal, you, I mean, you, you're completely in the backseat now. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, further, I'm in the trunk.  But I see a happiness on your face as well.  She lets me out for air every once in a while.  Yeah.  Hi, Sal.  Sal's kind of happy about it, because he doesn't have to deal with mom.  Maybe that's the secret, Dawn.  Huh?  Maybe that's the secret, what he said.  Yeah, don't have to deal with mom.  Yeah.  Yeah, she gets angry when I don't.  I hope she's not listening.  Oh, I know.  Well, she's probably not.  She doesn't know how to turn on the radio.  She doesn't figure out how to put on an exam. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  What do I do?  Where's the crank?  Somehow the DVR will wind up going on, obviously.  Yeah, I don't know.  She goes like this.  She goes, ooh, I don't know that remote control thing.  Like it's some newfangled device.  God.  Now, what would she be mad at?  That I tell her that she doesn't pay attention to anything but the babies now.  She's just completely into her grandchildren, which, you know, I guess she waited long enough for them.  Yeah, I think she's a little annoyed that she had to wait as long as she had to wait. 
[02:21:00]  I don't think she, she didn't think this was ever going to happen.  No.  Of course not.  We all wrote ourselves off.  Right.  I had conversations with all three of you, and you're like, kids, health.  Yeah, that ship sailed.  But now that you have one, now that you have one, obviously you've changed your toes.  They are both.  My brother is a disgusting display of fatherly love.  Oh, yeah.  That is, it just makes me wretch when I say it.  Joe's an amazing daddy.  He is.  Yeah, good for Joe. 
[02:21:30]  Good for Joe.  He used to be an amazing guitarist.  He still is.  Oh, that second fiddle now.  Oh, when I saw him leaning over the crib with his guitar, playing a little song, I was like,  ugh.  I remember him snorting coke off a horseback.  And there he is.  I think he plays the Winnie the Pooh song on his guitar for the baby.  Yeah.  Let's remind people of the trip to Rutland, Vermont, which we called Slutland.  And, yeah, there were different babies in the room that day, weren't there? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oof.  Yeah.  Anthony, that's that middle child thing.  Anthony isn't like not getting the attention.  That's the babies you're getting.  Now, I brought this up.  It's not the fact that I'm not getting the attention.  Because I haven't changed here.  Everyone else changed.  And it's not about my attention.  It's about being able to hang out with Joe and Dawn.  Let's go to the bar.  Let's do this, whatever.  And when they come over Mom's house, we would all hang out around the table, drink, laugh. 
[02:22:30]  And now it's just this baby, like, toys and garbages all over the place.  The discussions are about the baby.  How many fucking times did I have to listen to, to, you should hear, Layla makes this screaming sound now.  All right, enough about the screaming sound.  Eee, eee.  Watch, I'll get her to do it.  Eee, eee.  And I'm just like, what happened?  And what happened to Joe just playing some Blue Oyster cult lead?  Oh, we discussed, you know, the color of what's in their diaper. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, wonderful.  And, oh, did they pee enough today?  And, oh, this spit-off just came out so projectile.  Yeah.  Now that's my brother and sister.  And the kids are close in age, right?  Yeah, two months.  Wow.  Layla was born May 15th, and Warren was born July 20th.  Warren Dean.  Warren Dean.  His name's Warren Dean.  Warren Dean.  Very serious.  He'll be indicted on charges in Watergate or something.  Doesn't that sound like a Watergate?  Great name.  I think it's actually like a financial broadcaster on some radio station in New York.  I'm Warren Dean, and that's what's happening in finance. 
[02:23:30]  Warren Dean Esquire.  Anthony, you've got to look at this differently, though, because eventually Warren is going  to be 14 bringing, you know, girls around for you.  All right.  And I could thank him two years earlier for bringing one for me.  No, I tease, of course.  And he'll be 61?  Oh, he's 63.  Hello.  Hey, well, Brother Joe's on 10, because he wants that.  So now we've got the trifecta of cumulus. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, you know something?  Change the tag.  I don't want him to know his brother Joe anymore.  It's Father Joe.  Father Joe.  Now he's Father Joe, because I don't know what happened.  I don't know what happened to Brother Joe.  I don't know what happened to my mic either.  Well, it's a goddamn thing.  Yeah.  Father Joe.  All right.  Here he is.  Father Joe.  It's Father Joe now.  So what happened?  Joe grows up.  Anthony freaks out.  Joe grows up in his 40s.  In his late 40s.  Wow. 
[02:24:30]  Congrats.  Really late.  Don't you think I feel as though I've had enough of what you call fun?  I mean, it's fine, man.  I definitely, I enjoyed snorting coke off whores back.  Oh my God.  Here it is.  I had a perfect fucking, a perfect time growing up.  But you know what, man?  This is.  It's just, it's all about the, I was doing exactly what I'm doing now anyway.  This is Jeff Goldblum's speech in Invasion of the Body Snatchers. 
[02:25:00]  No, we were wrong to resist.  We were wrong.  You are a rock star and I, and I, and it's, it's a beautiful thing that you can live like  that, but I'm not, and it doesn't matter.  It is all about the girl.  But you used to be a rock star.  Why is he calling you a rock star?  I don't know.  He used to, he is, he still is.  Joe, Joe.  I still travel the fucking world.  I love it.  It's, it's a lot of fun.  I have a great time doing it.  But dude, you come home and you see the little girl.  That's it.  I'm done.  Yeah. 
[02:25:30]  Okay.  Well, what's that sound I'm hearing?  I'm hearing a baby crying.  Little Warren's crying.  That's it.  Oh, I thought, I thought Fez had joined our show for a second.  No, Joe, the thing is, it's not, it's, it has nothing to do with your lifestyle as far  as that.  It has to do with what's important, me.  When you, when, when you're hanging out at mom's, it's, there's no shit check on, it's 
[02:26:00]  always baby stuff.  Like I told you, give it a couple more years, you'll be shitting your pants too, and then  she'll pay attention.  That's a good line.  Oh, what?  I didn't hear it.  The baby was crying.  Oh, that's a great sound, isn't it?  Oh my God.  You know what though, man?  You see one fucking smile and it makes up for all crying.  Yes, it does.  Oh, you know I can't smile without you. 
[02:26:30]  You're making me sick.  I know, I know.  Just picture this.  Picture this.  You got a, you got a horrendous hangover.  Yeah.  One day, one day.  It's Saturday morning.  Well, why'd you talk, Father Joe?  Oh, why not?  Father Joe's talking.  Yeah, because it's all about the kid.  Go ahead.  One day you'll find the right girl, you settle down.  I settle down every night, man, with a different girl, with every knife.  What are you talking about, man?  I need the knife.  Can you imagine a horrendous hangover?  Yeah.  And crying baby in the morning. 
[02:27:00]  And hearing crying baby?  No.  Oh, actually, wait a minute.  I do.  It's called coming into this show on a daily basis.  Now, try to figure out who the crying baby is.  I haven't had a horrendous hangover in a long time.  Yeah, me neither, Joseph.  And the baby stopped crying.  You feed the baby, the baby stopped crying.  That's all you have to do, Andy.  Oh, Dawn, put your tit back.  Oh, my God.  Well, all right, let me.  Can you please breastfeed in front of all of us? 
[02:27:30]  That would be so creepy in so many ways.  The baby's only using one.  Could I maybe use the other one?  The baby cried for like a few seconds, and then you see the kid, and he's done.  Yeah, he's good, see?  Dawn's got some pretty big tits right there.  Oh, my God.  Doesn't she?  They got large.  What about a crowd?  Anything?  Yeah, yeah.  Except an uncomfortable look?  I'll applaud Dawn's big tits.  Yeah.  I got bigger.  I think, right?  Jimmy can't look.  That's what childbirth does.  They're big and full.  Look, Jimmy.  Look to your...  Jimmy's not looking because he's thinking, ask about her vag. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, no.  Sal's here.  Oh, yeah.  Sal, yes, she does have big tits.  Sal's just a step on it.  There's no blood there.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Uncle Paul.  Lock the front door.  You've got to see what those babies look like before they pump 42 ounces from each one.  Oh, really?  Oh, my goodness.  What do you have?  One of those breast pumps?  Huge.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, I went out and bought the Cadillac of breast pumps.  Oh, you did, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah, the good one.  But every once in a while, she'll take a drive up to New Hampshire.  She won't get a chance to pump.  So those fuckers blow up huge.  So, Joe, what do you think Anthony's big issue is?  Like, what do you think it is?  With having a baby, I think, honestly, what he saw was, growing up, and just give me a second before you say it fucking works. 
[02:29:00]  I know you're going to jump all over this.  He saw the old man and what happened to his life trying to raise three kids at 24 years old.  So I think that anything having to do with babies, with kids, I think it's a very deep-seated psychological thing, which is fine.  There's nothing wrong with it.  But I think that Dawn and I probably were able to overcome that and see that you can have it. 
[02:29:30]  That's the bullshit.  The only overcoming was yours going into an unprotected vagina.  Yeah.  That's overcoming.  You overcame.  That's absolutely true.  That's how it happens.  Yes, Anthony.  But Joe, you guys were all on the same page, like, feeling the same way about kids and raising a family.  And then circumstances.  We never actually felt, we were never as adamant about, I mean.  Or really unplanned? 
[02:30:00]  I really didn't think that it was going to happen.  But, you know, surprise, surprise, at 44, it happens.  And you just go, well, that's pretty cool.  I got to go with this.  Sometimes you look at that abandoned, dusty old house, and someone walks out the front door.  And you're like, I didn't think anyone was living in there.  There's still someone living in this old house.  Let's talk about your sister's vag for a while.  That's great.  Come on.  It was like a horse race. 
[02:30:30]  Here it comes.  And baby is in the lead.  Baby's in the lead, but menopause is coming up quickly.  Menopause is coming up quickly, but baby is still ahead by the nose.  And menopause is.  Don't use that.  It's too loud.  You're going to bother the baby.  Oh, I'm sorry, Jimmy.  Jimmy's such a natural with babies.  I like babies.  Yeah, of course he is.  Creep.  Because he looks like one.  Joe, you think basically that Anthony's allowing childhood stuff to kind of creep into his adulthood  and affect the way he looks at babies?  Yeah, absolutely. 
[02:31:00]  I think when he was a kid, he saw the old man freak out about having three kids.  I mean, really freak out.  The old man went off his fucking nut and blew a gasket.  He definitely blew a gasket.  He had to get as far away as possible.  He went to the other ocean.  And become a cowboy.  An ocean stopped him.  Yeah.  He would have gone further if an ocean hadn't stopped him.  That's the crux of Anthony's problem with kids.  Yeah, probably is.  You know, I don't like the memory of the spaghetti hitting the wall.  But I don't like how these guys are talking to you. 
[02:31:30]  You all felt the same thing.  All right.  You're right, Opie.  Go fuck yourself.  But they're acting like they were able to overcome this.  We're different people, I guess.  It was just circumstances that got you two to where you are today.  I think it's different perspective on the issue, too.  You know, man, I started to realize it's not that huge a change in your life.  It really isn't, man.  Well, Joseph's the guy.  Joseph's the guy.  It's easy for him to say.  More importantly, we've just plowed through 8,000, and Dow is now in the 7,000s. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  We're down 689 points.  We're almost down 700, and the stock market's been open for seven minutes.  Dawn, if you have any, I just want you to know.  I know financially times are tough, and you know that if you need any money, white babies  go for so much.  We're not selling them.  Are you not selling the kid?  No, we're not selling them.  Oh, come on.  On the open market?  He'd get a lot.  He's gorgeous.  Cute and white kid, baby.  You could just have another.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  What's going on? 
[02:32:30]  Have another?  Uh-uh.  I thought she was going to whip out a tit.  I swear to God.  Oh, yeah.  That was.  No.  I'm trying to relax.  I hope he's ready to go.  That would rock.  It kind of would.  Because it would just be creepy on so many levels.  That's a matter.  The boy doesn't like all the ruckus.  The boy's trying to relax.  I don't like being on the radio.  Giving us how to soothe the baby.  He's just got to be calm.  Kids relaxing.  Yeah.  All right.  We're over 8,000 now, Ant.  So we're back.  Yeah, that scared people right there.  They're sipping into 7,000.  By the way, breaking news. 
[02:33:00]  It said breaking news on MSNBC.  You know how they do their breaking news thing?  Yeah.  End of capitalism?  Question mark.  That wasn't working news today.  We're going commie?  Nice.  Socialism.  You thought Obama was going to do the socialism thing.  Well, the one thing.  This crash is bringing the price of gas down.  Yeah.  The price of oil is down into the 80s a barrel, which is nice.  And, well, okay.  I guess you could take a seat in a more comfy spot with your little baby. 
[02:33:30]  My little nephew.  Your little nephew.  There is a happiness in Anthony's eyes.  He just doesn't want to really, you know.  I'm very happy for my brother and sister and everybody that was involved in the fucking process to get the children.  Everybody involved in the process.  Thank you, Patrick.  Yes, Patrick.  Good job fucking my sister, Patrick.  Jesus.  You really laid that pipe down.  Nice.  Oh, my God.  You're making me very uncomfortable.  Yeah. 
[02:34:00]  Which is really hard to do.  I'm almost honored.  I'm kind of with you, too, there today, Jimmy.  I'm here with a full rod.  Hey, Dawn, are you lactating?  Dawn, comment.  Dawn, are you lactating at all?  No?  No, the lactating is done?  No, the baby rejected me from the get-go.  In the hospital, we probably had about nine lactation consultants that came in, you know.  There's a lactation consultant?  Yeah.  What do they do?  They take the baby.  The baby's crying.  They shove his mouth.  They taste your mouth and see what's wrong with it.  Let me get a little shot of that.  Yeah, the baby would not cooperate, would not latch down. 
[02:34:30]  He kind of put his mouth around and go, ah, ah.  That happens, a kid will reject it sometimes?  Oh, boy.  You better get him liking those things real quick.  No, he takes the formula in the bottle.  He starts smiling when Clay Aiken songs are playing.  Yeah, you know, I've got an expiration milk joke that I'm holding back on.  Oh, dude, that's good.  Yeah.  Maybe if your milk didn't have a picture of Adam Walsh missing on the side of it. 
[02:35:00]  Oh.  Why, Ant?  Because that's an old joke.  I did get to use the pump in the hospital and try that whole thing.  By the way, Ant?  Yeah.  Ant?  Yes.  And Jimmy, tonight the baby will not be at Nags Head Ale House in Huntington, New York.  But to you, the U2 tribute band will be.  NotU2.com.  I've got to go.  Love you guys.  All right.  Father Joe.  No, Father Joe now.  Father Joe.  No longer Brother Joe.  People really want more Sal. 
[02:35:30]  Sal, any comment about what we just were talking about with the kids and Anthony and why Anthony  might not want to be a father?  I just can say I have a lonely life now.  I see the family once in a while.  Yeah.  How long have you been retired now?  Nine years.  Nine years.  Nine years.  And he just, it's him and mom just muttering around the house.  And now that the kids are here.  You should have been there yesterday.  There was no muttering. 
[02:36:00]  Uh-oh.  Was he yelling?  Did you get in trouble yesterday?  No, I'm always in trouble.  How is it?  Over that.  You're 70.  Yeah.  And you still get in trouble from a woman.  What is it that men have to like, they have their mommies at first that just yell at them  all the time, tell them what to do.  And then the second they're free, you wind up getting in some shit where you got to get  yelled at still.  You're 70.  Why is a woman yelling at you?  It's your mother that's doing it.  Yeah.  What did you do wrong, Sal? 
[02:36:30]  Everything.  There isn't anything I do right.  You know I'm going to get killed when I get home if she learns how to turn that on.  Here's the trick.  Here's the trick, Sal.  It was all for radio.  Yeah.  It was just a bit.  It was for the radio.  Just say that and everything will be fine.  Get him to tell why he's in trouble.  It's all for the radio.  But Sal, why are you in trouble?  Yeah, I want to know specifically.  I don't know that.  There's no answer to that why I'm in trouble.  What do you expect me to have an answer?  She'll just go, oh, Sal, you're an idiot.  That's what she'll say. 
[02:37:00]  Did you leave your socks around?  No, nothing.  I was perfect.  I was fine.  Yeah.  Sal will do like, my mother will go like, I want to redecorate.  I want to retile the floor or something.  And then, you know, Sal will dish it out.  Go ahead.  And then you just got to take shit.  Yes.  Yes.  That's called marriage when you're old.  Oh.  But now, one interesting thing that comes up, Sal will always mention when girls come  on to them in front of Mom. 
[02:37:30]  He'll mention those.  Oh, that's not smart, Sal.  What happened when you were out with the Caddy?  Well, I went up the street to go to Stop and Shop.  I had to top down my beautiful car.  And I get out, and this blonde comes walking towards me.  And she's really young and very pretty.  She said to me, what kind of car is that?  I said, it's a Cadillac.  She says, I didn't know Cadillac made a car like that.  I said, yeah.  And she walks up, puts her face right in front of mine, and she says, I'd do anything to  take a ride in that.  And then I went immediately home and told my wife, because if somebody saw me, I would 
[02:38:00]  have been dead.  Is he having anything?  Could you?  Now, that, I'm trying to, I'm just trying to figure out what that was about.  Was she, okay, was she a prostitute?  No, no.  I think she was going in Stop and Shop.  I was going in to get Viagra or something.  And you, like, if you said, hey, you want to go for a ride, she absolutely would have  hopped in?  I think so. 
[02:38:30]  She was very serious, at least I think so.  Sal, how old was she?  About 25 years.  Holy shit.  Nice.  Sal, you're insane.  Look, I love my mother and stuff, but if some girl like that comes up to you, you got  to at least, you know, get a little, a little face.  That's why I came up here.  I was hoping.  Let her enjoy the ride in the Cadillac with her head in your lap.  I think Sal might be leaving a part out.  Like, she probably said, I'd do anything for a ride in that.  And he said, really?  Anything? 
[02:39:00]  And she went, it's a figure of speech.  And then she walked away laughing.  Well, why don't we get Dawn to give him a lap dance or something?  Jesus!  Even I don't go that far.  Isn't that partially incense or something?  Incense.  All right, Sal Voss is on the show today.  Oh, very good.  That's fantastic.  One of these days, I guess, Joe will come in with a little Layla.  We'll do family day.  Why would the mic work?  Try that again. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, we'll do family day.  Yeah, family day.  That'll be good.  And I could watch you guys talk about babies and stuff while I just sit like a lump of shit.  It'll be gay.  Can I have to bring Roe?  No, you can leave Roe.  Mom never wants to go anywhere.  Yeah, she does.  She wants to go to my house.  And she wants to go and see the grandkids is all.  And no matter how many times I say you have an open invitation to come over to my house,  I kind of, you know, always get the, no, I want to be invited.  I'd say, well, especially in the afternoon.  It's like, you know, that's easy. 
[02:40:00]  She should just show up.  I told you about that.  At night, that might be weird.  She must ask Roe.  Otherwise, she doesn't show up.  She needs to be asked.  Yeah, she's a polite person.  I know she is, but she's mommy.  She can come over whenever she wants.  She doesn't want to walk in a little debauchery.  She wants to come over and have some kids.  She's going to knock on my bedroom door.  I have to hide a girl in a closet.  Yes.  Mom will burn all of her stuff.  Oh, wait a minute.  Hey, Sal, you missed Jill?  Sal does.  Sal does.  Yes, he does. 
[02:40:30]  Sal does.  Sal was more in love than anybody.  I'll tell you that much.  I like to watch.  At my age, that's all you can do.  They were making out a lot in the beginning, right?  Right in front of you?  Yes.  You kind of miss her, don't you?  Yeah, a little bit.  She was nice to me.  Yeah, Sal was a little smitten.  But you understand Ann's point, right?  Oh, yeah, I understand.  It's like last night I called him because I thought,  gee, I'll leave my car at his house and ride in with him.  I don't think so.  I was like, I have company. 
[02:41:00]  Wait, so you couldn't have Sal over?  Yeah, why?  I had company over.  Well, kids always over there, though.  Did you have friends?  Yeah.  Yeah, friends are over.  So I couldn't Sal come over and have you friends?  When did you let Sal get into the jersey?  I heard a lot of laughing and grunting, so I don't know.  It was getting a little late.  That's all.  And Anthony's a responsible broadcaster.  I have to get up for work, so it was time for me to go to bed and have sex.  No, I was coming over in the morning and leave my car, not last night. 
[02:41:30]  Oh.  And then ride in and then go back to your house.  Oh, that would have been fine.  Oh, okay.  It's a little late, but go ahead.  Of course it is.  I got lost.  I had to pee four times coming.  I had to stop on the expressway.  I stopped at Howard Johnson's or whatever.  And then finally, downstairs in the garage, they wouldn't let me pee, and I had to pee.  So I gave him ten bucks.  I said, I'm going to pee on your lot here.  And I did.  And you did. 
[02:42:00]  Absolutely.  He said absolutely.  Cost me ten bucks for that pee.  Sal, you rule.  That's right.  Jim's paid more than that for this.  Oh, God.  I've got as high as $3.50.  $3.50?  Yeah.  When you become 70, you've got to do more.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, Sal, so you're hoping for something from us today, right?  Something.  Have you ever seen Two Girls, One Cup?  Oh, Sal.  Have you ever seen Two Girls, One Cup?  I saw three on a couch.  No, that's right. 
[02:42:30]  Sal did.  A long time ago.  A while ago.  Sal watched The Lesbian Couch.  The big Russian girl you had there?  Yeah.  When was this?  How long ago?  Oh, long time ago.  It was at N.E.W. on the couch on the lesbian couch.  Sal was there one day.  There was a lot of hijinks.  And my friend was playing Pocket Pool.  Yeah, your friend had his hands in his pocket, and I'm like, what the hell's he doing?  Well, getting a little...  Well, you should be doing.  He's older than me.  Oh, that's why.  I mean, you know, that's...  This video, of course, the internet.  Now, I know you're not very familiar with computers and stuff, especially because of mom. 
[02:43:00]  She doesn't want to do it.  But this is the internet, and there are a lot of videos on it.  You can get a lot of things.  There's one video in particular called Two Girls, One Cup.  It's sort of a love story between two girls.  So, if we could get that video up.  It's a steaming hot video, Sal.  I mean, you're very steamy, very hot.  This is not just hot.  It's steaming hot.  Is the bathroom near here? 
[02:43:30]  Well, yeah.  Closer than you think.  This video, we show this video to everybody that comes in.  It's sort of like a...  It's all these special people like yourself.  It's sort of like a welcome.  Anybody over 70.  No, it's an initiation to anybody.  Initiation.  This can be enjoyed for children of all ages.  Let little Warren Dean show a watch.  Yeah.  Sal, so we want you to comment on what you see there for everybody. 
[02:44:00]  Two Girls Radio.  This is just for you.  Two Girls, One Cup.  Here we go.  Here we go.  For Sal.  Oh, okay.  Here we go.  All right.  I don't even like the title.  Now they kiss.  See, look at that.  Nice, right?  That's cute.  Oh, shit.  Oh, God.  Oh, come on.  I know it's hot.  Give me a break.  What do you think, Sal? 
[02:44:30]  You show this to your mother, you'd be dead.  I'm not even going to tell your mother I saw this, because I'll be dead.  Oh, look.  They're just kissing.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, look.  Oh, now look.  Look, you know.  That's a little topping.  Yeah.  What do you think, Sal?  They must have chapped lips.  They got to put that stuff on their lips.  What the fuck?  That is disgusting.  And a little vomiting in the mouth.  Yes.  Is this a long time?  Oh.  Is this a long time? 
[02:45:00]  Like, he wants it to be over.  It's a horror movie.  And there they are, just with a big load of...  I think it's great.  Oh, wow.  I think we should all give it a big hand.  Yeah, I like that.  And the Opie and Anthony show.  Show it.  Show it.  Show it.  The Opie and Anthony show.  He said, that's class.  That's class.  That's my Maryland talk.  Yeah.  And I could go home, you know.  You've been in New York, though, for how many years?  35.  And you still have a baldy more accent.  Yeah, but you've seen my brother. 
[02:45:30]  You should hear him.  I mean, he sounds like he's from Georgia when I go down.  How does he talk?  How y'all doing?  He calls me Bud.  How you doing, Bud?  Bud?  Bud?  But you're Sal.  Yeah, Sal.  You don't know how to say that.  It's too many letters.  Holy crap, he's great.  Sal, you rule.  You rule.  So, we're going to play that again?  Yeah, you want to see it again?  No!  Of course not.  Well, we can show you other stuff. 
[02:46:00]  I mean, yeah.  We got plenty.  I'm really glad I came now.  It's the highlight of my day.  The internet is full of stuff like that.  If you were able to have a computer at the house, you could watch stuff like that day  and night.  Yeah.  Wouldn't that be great?  I don't even know how to work myself.  I'm not going to get a computer.  I know you don't, because there's so many times I answer my phone and hear you and mom  with mom just yelling at you in the background.  Oh, Sal, you don't know which way you're going.  When are you driving too fast?  I'm like, okay.  They sat on the phone.  Oh, really?  Dialed.  Like, I'm probably first. 
[02:46:30]  The A.  You know, so he probably hit one.  And I've heard so many conversations of yours.  Thank God.  I just found out in my car, I press a button at the telephone, and I tell her what number  I want, and they give it to me.  Oh, yeah.  I used it today.  OnStar thing?  Yeah, the OnStar, but there's also a phone there.  I can do OnStar and a phone.  Yeah, sure.  Press the button.  I say, dial.  And she says, dial all the numbers, including the area code.  And I say, b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b.  And they give me whoever I want. 
[02:47:00]  I spoke to Patrick because I was lost.  How did you ever get lost?  Did you ever see that movie, Lost in Manhattan?  No.  It's coming to theaters soon.  Theaters.  Is it out right now?  No, it's coming soon.  Yeah, how do you get lost in Manhattan when it's like...  I drove by the place, I went down another street, and I was lost.  But it's a grid of numbers.  Yeah, I know.  That's why I don't have a computer.  It's all these numbers.  And doesn't your caddy have a nav system? 
[02:47:30]  Yes.  I don't know how to work that either.  There's a market out there for...  Oh, Sal.  To make this stuff more easier for older people.  I went out to the master to buy cigarettes.  Uh-oh.  And I had to punch the thing in to get home.  And it was taking me in the opposite direction.  It was sending me east instead of west.  I'm going, what the hell is this?  I punch it, punch it again.  Puka-taka, whatever it is.  And I didn't know how to find it.  It was terrible.  He's going to Indian reservations for his cigarettes? 
[02:48:00]  Yeah.  Man, you are bored.  You're bored at all.  You go to the Mastic Indian reservation to buy your cigarettes.  $41 a case.  A case?  Nice.  $41.50 a case.  That's sweet, right?  A box.  A carton, yeah.  A carton.  See, that's another reason I don't have a computer.  I don't know how to spell.  Case, carton, whatever.  But it's a lot cheaper?  Oh, yeah.  Are they regular cigarettes?  Are they like...  No, no.  I get what I...  They have every cigarette in the world. 
[02:48:30]  They do?  Like, you say you want to buy Marlboro, you buy them for that cheap?  Yeah.  Well, I think Marlboro they had on sale for $25 a carton.  Wow.  But I smoke Carleton's.  They're $41.50.  I think that's once you walk in the door, they go, okay, look at the car.  We charge you $41.50.  Oh, they see the Cadillac.  They charge you a little more.  It's a nice ride out there, except my computer doesn't know how to get me there.  You know, you could get turn-by-turn directions on that phone thing, on OnStar. 
[02:49:00]  You hit it, and then you tell them where you want to go.  They'll look it up for you, and then they give you turn-by-turn and say, you know, now  make a left, make a right.  Do they charge me extra for that?  No, it's just, you know, whatever you pay for OnStar.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that's good stuff.  And then if you get bored, you just hit OnStar, and you could chat.  Yeah, you could chat.  They love that.  You could tell me how to fix my car, or give me some guy from GM.  Sometimes my OnStar, my phone, and my Escalator ring, and I answer it, and the other day it 
[02:49:30]  was some woman.  She goes, is Mike there?  And I go, hold on, I'll look.  And then, obviously, no one's in my car at that point.  And I started talking to her like I knew her, and said that her husband owed me money for  cocaine.  And I got lucky.  I was like, you know Bob.  She goes, how do you know Bob?  I go, oh, I've known Bob for a while.  And she's like, that's my husband.  I go, yeah, he owes me money for coke. 
[02:50:00]  And she was, I just kind of left him hanging there.  Poor Bob, when he got home.  I hope she was a cop, but she dialed the wrong number.  And now she's got you a number.  We got a coke dealer.  And you're thrown in prison.  And raped.  Yeah, yes, yes.  You talk about these computers and stuff.  I don't even know the phone number of my phone in the car.  See?  I've only had it two and a half years.  Why should I know?  Why should you?  How often do you call your car?  Well, if I could give it to mommy, and she could call me. 
[02:50:30]  Sal, we've got to go to the Indian Reservation.  Okay, Kit.  Sal in Knight Rider.  My senses are detecting you have to pee again.  You're right, Kit.  Where do I go?  I carry my little bottle, which I had to use.  Now, I'm going to put the little bottle out in the seat.  Thank you, Kit.  I have to pee again.  Jesus Christ, Sal. 
[02:51:00]  We haven't gone a mile.  Don't argue with me, car.  You sound like Rue.  That's pretty close.  Oh, wow.  My phone's probably ringing at home.  People calling her and saying, do you know what your husband's saying?  Oh, yeah.  I'll take a sucker, scratch his ass.  You got an extra bedroom?  They're pretty much taken up at this point.  The Hotel Kumia.  Yes.  I'm going to start putting those key bars.  Cribs. 
[02:51:30]  Cribs.  Yes.  I want to get hotel locks put on there and give cards out so you can slide them through.  You really should.  All right.  You're upstairs.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, you've been upgraded to one of the suites.  To my suite.  You're in the room with the little bear on it.  You're in the room with the balloon on it.  Hey, we got to get Sal to say Christmas shoes.  I mean, that's the big...  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's one of your favorite songs.  You like the Christmas shoes song?  You want me to cry, right?  Yeah.  Sal cries at that song. 
[02:52:00]  I cry at everything.  You like that song?  Every time I go home, I cry.  What do you like about Christmas shoes?  Yeah.  What is the story of Christmas shoes?  This little boy has $7.92.  And the shoes, they cost $7.95.  So he's got to buy these shoes for his mother because she's dying, I think.  So he don't have money.  So this little guy, this other man behind him, when he's trying to pay, he gives the money,  the extra money, and he takes his... 
[02:52:30]  Mommy will get her new shoes.  Mommy will be so happy.  It was a nice story.  And then she drops dead.  Yeah.  They go to the home, and she's dead already.  She don't get the shoes.  What part makes you cry, though?  Just the whole story.  The whole story?  The whole story.  It's a very nice little piece.  Did the kid save the receipt at least and bring the shoes back?  The guy behind him took the receipt.  Oh, the guy...  Yeah. 
[02:53:00]  That lent him the money and took all the money.  And the boy's address.  You're going to have to take some pictures for that three cents.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  I think the guy behind the counter wouldn't make such a big fuss over three cents.  Give me a sore Christmas bottom.  Oh, we're...  So Sal could hear the...  Oh, the headphones.  The song.  Here's your song, Sal.  It's Christmas shoes, right?  Here it is.  Here it is.  Could you hurry, sir? 
[02:53:30]  Daddy says there's not much time.  Uh-oh.  Looks like he wants to sing the song again.  He's telling his daughter that mommy's going to die.  That's the Christmas gift.  What, a dead mommy?  Yeah, a pine box under the tree.  I have a bow on it.  That's...  Mom, at that...  Oh, Sal's got a tear in his eyes.  Sal's crying over Christmas.  I told you.  It's like Pavlov's retard. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, Sal's crying.  That's not nice.  I'm all the way to Manhattan to cry.  Sal is a very sensitive man.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is sad, though.  I mean, it's Christmas, and he wants to just get her the shoes.  Yeah, now the kid's going to grow up with no mommy.  That's got to suck.  Yeah.  They move the holiday up.  It's Christmas?  Oh, sure.  Or in the song.  It's Christmas somewhere.  Yeah.  Mommy needs a satin hat, apparently.  Mommy needs rouge on her cheeks. 
[02:54:30]  Oh, no.  Look, it's Christmas formaldehyde.  Oh, God.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  Sal's having a moment over there.  How come you're not crying?  Well, because he doesn't have any emotions in his body.  I'm like a Vulcan now.  Yeah.  It's not that sad.  For my mom.  Yeah, that's sad.  You ever hear this song?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:55:00]  We've all heard it.  Thanks to that.  I was going to put this on his ear so he could cry.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Daddy says there's not much time.  That's right.  We've got to get to the part where the mom dies.  Take him to the hospital, you fucking slouch.  Yeah, stop singing and call 913.  He's trying to get an insurance policy written real quick.  Christmas insurance policy.  Exactly.  Oh, it is. 
[02:55:30]  It's no pendulum.  No, it's not.  Because the pendulum swings the other way.  Oh, here it is.  It's the kid.  For my mama, please.  For her mama, please.  Yeah.  Christmas Eve and these shoes are just her style.  Aw.  Aw. 
[02:56:00]  Did you hurt me, son?  Daddy says there's not much time.  Ah!  She's gone.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's gone.  Those shoes will make us mine.  Want her to be.  Yeah, um.  I'm sorry.  She's there.  Mommy's not going to be around for Christmas.  Ah!  Wouldn't it be funny if you misunderstood.  You brought home a couple of rabbis.  I thought she said Christmas Jews. 
[02:56:30]  That was good.  Christmas Jews, right?  Aw.  That was very good.  No, Jesus.  It's still going?  All right.  It's the, uh.  What did they come up with a cure?  This is when they do the autopsy.  Oh.  Mommy's.  Mommy's taking that Christmas snooze.  Oh, Sal.  Quick on his feet.  Thanks, guys.  Are we allowed to show you nudity today, or is that a no-no? 
[02:57:00]  Oh, Sal, it's fine.  I said she won't know.  It's for the show.  It's not real.  The show.  It's just so you get good ratings, I'll watch.  Well, Stalker Patty is here, our resident slut.  That's not really nudity, is it?  Well, that's what I'm wondering.  I said hello.  Enough.  You know.  Oh.  You know Patty, right?  Yes.  You've seen her at appearances.  Yes.  You want to see her naked?  Oh, God.  I don't think so.  Ro wouldn't like it.  Yeah.  Let me off with that.  She's a chippy for Sal. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah.  She's like 50 years old or something.  She's too old for me.  Yeah.  Too young.  Not too old.  Here's Patty.  You want to say hi to Sal there, Patty?  Hi, Sal.  How are you doing?  Hi, Patty.  How you doing?  Good.  Sal's doing a Patty impression.  Well, it's better than home.  Can you do a Sal impression now, Patty?  Yeah.  Do it.  Do your Sal.  Ro.  Ro.  What are you doing, Ro?  Come over here.  Come over here. 
[02:58:00]  Come over here.  Last time we saw Patty, she was being fingered.  Yeah.  What has gone on since that?  She had two in the pink and one in the stink.  Yeah.  You were getting double.  Does that mean I have the stinkest pink?  Patty and Patty.  Patty and Patty.  That was from a show about 10 years ago.  Patty, guys.  What did you say?  The stinkest pink.  Ron and Fez had a contest.  Yeah.  You know something?  Really, for one, who looks mostly ace freely? 
[02:58:30]  You win.  But that was years and years and years ago.  Your improv skills are horrible.  But I did notice something.  What?  What did you do to your hair?  I straightened it, and I got some coloring in it.  You did.  I'm starting to have it styled.  I have a friend that does it, and she doesn't charge me.  I just pay for the stuff and bring it to her.  Did I ask this?  Yeah.  Did I ask that?  Is there much details that you're giving me? 
[02:59:00]  I asked, what did you do to your hair?  Yes.  And you gave me a whole thing on your friend.  Yeah.  I straightened it, and then I had it, like, done.  Who's your friend?  Does she also make wigs for the way out?  No.  No.  I could have helped her out.  I was a hairdresser once.  That's right.  So I was a hairdresser.  Yeah.  Back in the old days.  I just want to take care of it.  You know, that's all.  I take care of myself.  It looks like it has a lot more bounce and luster.  I hate to admit that.  Yeah.  A little luster.  That's okay.  I'm still experimenting. 
[02:59:30]  Hey, Patty, now that we showed you, are you shoving things in you now?  So did Brundle.  No.  No?  No.  No.  So she went through with her hands.  This week was enough for three months.  Just the memory of it will last me for three months.  So what did you think?  You had one in the front, one in the back?  What do you think, Patty?  I don't know.  Why don't you let yourself come?  Yeah.  Why the guilt?  I don't know how to.  I have.  You make everyone stop.  Yeah.  The second you start feeling good, you all of a sudden, you say, stop, stop. 
[03:00:00]  You start screaming, stop.  Or maybe she only likes orgasming until, like, black gangbang porn.  Yeah.  That's what she likes.  What do you think is going to happen if you go all the way to completion?  I don't know.  I don't know if I'll get to that point.  It's got to be with a special person.  It's got to be with someone I care about.  We've been hearing this for a decade.  You care about me?  For a decade.  Isn't that a load of crap?  It's got to be a real relationship.  Oh, stop with the guilt. 
[03:00:30]  You'll never be in a real relationship.  Sure.  No, you won't.  Maybe my guy is out there.  I haven't met him yet.  What do you think he's doing?  Where?  Waiting for me.  At the home?  No, he's retiring.  Yeah.  He's getting a gold watch right now.  No kidding, yeah.  Yeah.  I just think it's golden to save yourself, no matter how old you are.  It's all right, pony boy.  Yeah.  A hundred and nine.  Yeah.  Pony boy.  Let me tell you something.  If Patty ever gives in, she's going to be so fucking disappointed. 
[03:01:00]  I know.  You have no idea.  You've built this up now where it's got to be this special moment.  You've got to get the first.  And some guy's just going to stick it in you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You've got to get the first one out of the way, and then it gets better from there.  You think it's like one of those movies where they show the clip of the interlocking fingers  on the bed, and the, oh, pleasure face is all blurry, and kind of, it's not like that.  It's a lot of, oh, oh, oh, and then goopy stuff gets shot in you, and then you've got 
[03:01:30]  to get tissues.  Patty, comment?  I don't know.  I'll know that moment when I come to it.  It's not as romantic as you're thinking in your head.  Oh, it can be romantic.  You can make it.  It won't be romantic when it's an orderly, and he's crawling off you.  She's laying there with your white orthopedic shoes on.  He was just supposed to be there to roll you.  Exactly.  She's shelf shocked, staring straight ahead at the ceiling. 
[03:02:00]  Am I still a virgin?  No.  Not an MO.  That's right.  He pulls off one of his socks and cleans her off.  She has a back injury now.  Yeah.  You're waiting for one of these special moments.  She needs headphones.  Like in Ghost?  Are you waiting for that?  To have a special moment by a pottery wheel?  Or you can jump from one train car to another?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's exactly what I'm waiting for.  Anthony, we missed a really good line. 
[03:02:30]  Dogshit sniffer from Woodside.  Patty wants to have sex with a special person.  Make sure you take off his helmet first.  You want retard cock or what?  No.  They got large ones, we hear.  No, that's okay.  You don't want a big one?  No, I wouldn't fall in love with somebody like that.  Why not?  Wow, that's terrible of you.  That would be attractive to you.  Why not?  Would his intelligence intimidate you?  I would be attracted to somebody built like Chuck Norris. 
[03:03:00]  Chuck Norris?  You're a better shot with Chuck Wagon.  I should just keep talking right over the great lines of...  She's a hammer on tin with comedy laughs.  Unbelievable, Patty.  You want to grab some cock today or what?  She wants Chuck Norris.  What the fuck is it?  So you find Chuck Norris attractive?  Yes, I do.  He's cute.  He's 60.  I don't care.  I'm only seven years younger.  Chuck would rather fuck the crazy guy who fell in the well at the end of the movie. 
[03:03:30]  Nothing?  No.  In fact, compared to other people my age, I think I look great.  I saw a lady of 53.  She was old and frumpy.  Had an old house dress on.  I'm not...  That's not me.  And then you stepped away from the mirror and...  Now, why the cock got the best of her.  A-boo.  No.  A-boo.  Excuse me.  A-boo.  Double O.  A-boo.  A-boo.  Yeah. 
[03:04:00]  Well, Patty, um...  Went in in flames on that one.  That was hilarious.  Ooh.  That spin.  And I was rooting against it because mine won right before it bombed.  It was my delivery.  That was horrible.  I was so...  Fucking vaudevillian asshole I am.  It was fine.  Welcome to laughing.  Yeah.  I should have been through a fucking door in that one.  Fucking Sammy Davis, the glass eye, falls out.  A-coom-coom-coom. 
[03:04:30]  Clothes around the bridge of his nose.  Oh, fuck his mouth.  Well, we should, uh...  I think we should take a break.  Yeah, I gotta make...  We'll take a break.  I'm sure Sal's gotta piss.  Do you pee a lot, Sal?  I do, too.  I'm constantly...  From Holtzville to here, I've peed six times.  Wow.  Six times.  Have you ever checked your prostate?  Because for me, there was nothing wrong.  I thought there was.  I've had prostate problems.  He's got a doctor's hand up his ass all the time.  He's one right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  So one of my pills is for the prostate. 
[03:05:00]  I think it makes me pee.  Does it help more or no?  No.  I take 22 pills.  How would I know what they're doing?  22 pills.  And I asked the doctor, I said, how do they know?  They go in your stomach.  They go in different directions.  One goes over here.  And they laugh at me.  Why?  It's a very good question, I thought.  Yeah.  I like it.  How do the pills know where to go?  It's a great question.  They melt, and they've got to go fix the heart, fix the prostate.  What if the prostate one goes to, like, the liver? 
[03:05:30]  I'd probably die.  What if the Viagra gets mixed up with the heart medication?  Oh, sure.  Your heart's as hard as a rock.  Your aorta comes out your mouth.  Instead of a heart on, I've got a heart on.  A heart on.  Jesus Christ.  Not bad.  All right.  Go piss, everybody.  Why don't we take a little break?  Yeah, let's do that.  We'll take a break and be back in a bit.  From O&A Pictures comes a true story of one man's pain. 
[03:06:00]  It does hurt.  And a family torn apart.  And it makes you feel really funny right after it happens.  The War of the Kumias.  I had the yelling parents, too, growing up until they got divorced, and it was just, you know.  And then you'd see, like, the old man would take the plate full of spaghetti and throw it,  and it would hit, like, the wall next to the phone.  And you're sitting there, and you're sitting there horrified, watching the spaghetti slowly go down the wall.  I can't get the fuck out of this.  I'm going to fuck you.  Oh, the horrified kids. 
[03:06:30]  Did dad actually leave after the fights?  Yeah, a lot of times, sure.  And then, you know, you'd be able to go to sleep, because the yelling would stop.  First, mom would have to wind down a little.  Man, that fucking asshole.  You know, even after dad left, she's still going.  Beat that shit like I need a fucking hole in the head.  I'm trying to sleep.  He's gone.  Shut up.  Come in here.  Shut up.  That way.  That's it.  Oh, God.  He's been gone a half hour.  When would he come back, the next day?  Yeah, like, the next day.  You know, they'd be sitting down, watching, like, Ronan Martin's laughing.  Laughing.  Everything was fine. 
[03:07:00]  You know, and then out of nowhere, you'd hear the rumbling.  You'd be in bed, and you'd be like,  Well, you're talking about that, bud.  And then you hear from the kids' room.  Can't you two just shut the fuck up for, like, one night?  And then we were pretty young, so, you know,  we got, you know, called into the room,  and mom sits down and goes,  Me and your father, I want you to know,  and I want you to know it has nothing to do with you,  we're divorced. 
[03:07:30]  Oh, okay.  Can I go out and play now?  How is this going to change my life?  Does this mean I don't have to listen to...  Oh, it does?  Okay.  So it's a good thing.  Great.  Well, thank you for staying together for so long  and really, like, torturing us.  You couldn't have pulled this one, like, five years ago?  Yeah, fucking asshole!  Well, maybe we couldn't remember as much  and didn't have to listen to the yelling and screaming.  No way!  Here's an idea, Pop.  There you go. 
[03:08:00]  Right back into the Huntington boat ramp.  Give that a whirl.  The War of the Cummias.  This has got to be,  you're going to just sit there disgusted  having to listen to this crap.  We're back  with the Opie and Anthony shoot.  Sal just showing off all his pills  he has to take every day.  He dumped out a little pill thing  that had 20-some-odd pills in it.  And he's still talking about  how does the pills know what they're doing  when they get inside you. 
[03:08:30]  How do they know where to go?  Unbelievable.  I thought I saw a little ecstasy in there.  I don't think all his pills  are on the up-and-up, Anthony.  Jimmy points at one and goes,  Oh, Faltrex.  Cialis.  Viagra.  They said it's a cocktail.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  That's bad news.  That's a cocktail.  Oh, he was a hairdresser in the 70s.  The man from Clean  was a nice man.  I knew a guy named Freddie Mercury. 
[03:09:00]  We hit it off really well.  Rock Hudson.  Why would your mic be on, Sal?  Why would it be on?  Hold on.  Yeah, we need Sal's mic.  Does anybody want to join me tonight  for my other pills?  Oh, you take some night pills?  Yeah, I got the same amount.  At night?  Really?  Different pills.  A whole different set.  Wow.  I can't say that.  There's a couple pills  I got to take one in the morning  and one at night.  But it's close.  At 70, you just got to take  a lot of pills for some reason.  That's what they do.  I never heard of anybody  take that many pills. 
[03:09:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's ridiculous.  But I'm told by the doctor,  oh, yeah, we got people.  They're laying in bed dying, you know.  They're taking a lot of pills.  There's something that  doesn't sit with you very well,  and that's that.  What do they give you  in the hospital?  Well, I have a...  What's the word?  Delaudid.  Yeah.  Percocet.  I go into...  What do I go into?  Hallucinations, I think.  Three days on the Delaudid.  I didn't know who I was.  I was in the hospital  ripping things out of people's arms 
[03:10:00]  and shit like that.  It was terrible.  And then I thought  I was in this little cubicle  in Atlantic City  playing cards.  He actually thought  he was in Atlantic City  in the hospital  just from the pills.  From Delaudid.  How did the young people today,  like I take the Delaudid  and I hallucinate,  they take pills  to do that on purpose.  Yeah.  And I know how bad it felt  when I finally woke up  and I went,  these people are crazy.  He's ripping shit  out of people's arms  like, what happened?  I don't know,  Hal Holbrook just walked in 
[03:10:30]  and took my IV out.  Hal Holbrook.  And then got me  a full boat  and walked out.  Yeah, were you winning  at the casino?  I don't know.  They did that part  of the story got lost.  I'll make sure  that's what happened  to Anthony.  He only thought  that he was on a plane  and he went up  to the Mohegan Sun.  He actually wasn't.  Yeah.  He was in his kitchen seat.  Right.  You know,  it actually happened  to your mother, too.  Yeah.  When she was in Winthrop.  She hallucinated.  She thought this black woman  was raping her. 
[03:11:00]  I had to drive  from your house  back to Winthrop  because she was  going to walk home.  She was going to walk home?  She was going to walk home  from Winthrop to...  It all makes sense now.  She made me sleep  in a chair by the door.  And you know why  she did that?  She thought I was  going down there  to the bathroom  and fucking the nurses.  True story.  No.  Yeah.  Because she was hallucinating.  Yeah.  She thought a black woman  was coming in and raping her.  Yeah, one of the aides  or something  was trying to help her  change into a gown 
[03:11:30]  or something.  Did she say black woman  or did she say something else?  No, because she said to me  when I got there,  you see all those black women  over there in that room?  They're having a party.  You can hear it, right?  I'm going, oh, okay.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But Anthony's asking,  did she say black  or did she say...  No, she said black.  Oh, okay.  But he's a good person.  What do you think about Obama  as the next president?  You want my real opinion?  Hell yeah.  Right?  Let me get my finger  on the dump button  before... 
[03:12:00]  I'll make it easy.  I'm not voting for him.  Oh.  Yeah.  Why not?  I'm not either.  I can't vote for him.  I just can't.  The other thing  that bothers me  is the girl  being president.  Yeah, you don't like that.  I don't think  I like that either.  Yeah.  She doesn't seem  like she knows very much.  You don't like Detroit?  Do you like McCain?  I don't like him,  but it's the lesser  of the two evils, I think.  Yeah, we got ripped off  this time around.  The choices stink.  I don't think Obama stinks,  though.  I don't love him,  but I think he's all right. 
[03:12:30]  If Obama goes in,  he'll probably be shot  within two months.  Jesus.  Somebody will take his place.  There is a lot of speculation  because he would be  a very controversial president,  being the first black president,  that it might be a problem  with some of these extremists,  a lot of white supremacists,  a lot of that.  Oh, yeah?  Ku Klux Klan?  Yeah, yeah.  That people like that might,  you know,  but I'm sure they'll have  massive security on him.  Yeah, ask Martin Luther King.  He'll tell you.  Willie? 
[03:13:00]  Well, if they haven't gotten...  Willie, Sal?  If they haven't gotten Bush...  I mean, Bush.  You know how many people  want to kill Bush?  I mean, these Islamic extremists.  Islamic extremists,  if they can protect Bush  in this time,  they can protect...  Secret Service can protect  anyone, man.  You know what it is, though?  Kennedy was a mistake.  It's weird.  It's this...  There's this mentality  with...  Especially with assassins  where you wouldn't really  go after a Bush.  You know?  You wouldn't really go after  George Bush like that.  It's kind of a...  You know, the assassin. 
[03:13:30]  The kind of...  Hey, man.  Let me tell you.  The good old boy  kind of a...  You know,  Klansman kind of a thing.  I think he likes George...  They like George Bush.  But the dangerous guys...  The ones who want  to kill Bush  are the guys  that will give up  their own lives to do it.  The extremists.  But they're the same people  that would...  They'd like to kill Bush,  but they'd also like  to walk into a mall  with a bomb strapped to him.  That's what I'm saying.  But they can't get to him.  Yeah.  So Secret Service  is really good.  Like, they said Obama  has more Secret Service  protection than anybody. 
[03:14:00]  Don't you think  a lot of his enemies...  He'll be fine.  ...want him to be  the president, though,  too,  because he's  fucking it up pretty good.  Who?  Bush?  Yeah.  Or you'd think  they'd really just...  Bush doesn't really  go anywhere  where he's in danger.  The guy doesn't...  He's not stupid.  He's always on  the White House lawn  there giving a little speech  or in the White House.  Like where?  A library?  What was the name  of that other president  that got shot  because they were  trying to stuff him  in the car  to Secret Service  and he got shot...  Reagan?  Yes.  Reagan? 
[03:14:30]  Yes.  So they don't  protect that well.  I mean,  if somebody wants  to get in there...  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  You would never  see that today.  You would never  see a president  walking on a sidewalk  like that  with regular people  to get into a car.  They'd pull the car  like right there  underground garage.  There'd be something.  You just don't see  that anymore.  They were definitely  slacking on that one.  And they'd block off...  Isn't he blind  or something?  No, that's our...  That's David Patterson.  That's the governor.  What, Obama blind?  Yeah.  I thought he was. 
[03:15:00]  No, that's our governor,  silly.  What pills did you just take?  Okay.  I took the wrong pills.  I'm going into...  I don't know.  They're all the same to me.  Doesn't he just...  Doesn't he sing  I just called  to say I love you?  Take a seat, Sal.  You don't have to stand up.  My God.  Give up a seat for Sal.  Nah, sit on the couch.  That's good.  Sit next to Joseph T. Curry  who'll be at McGuire's  Comedy Club when? 
[03:15:30]  Yes.  Tonight and tomorrow night.  Tonight and tomorrow.  Come on down.  McGuire's...  Bring all your friends.  Sure.  Yeah, come up.  For Sal's killing today.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Sal's going to MC.  You are.  I like the fact  that he supports, too.  He's got the  O.B. and Anthony shirt on.  Oh, yeah.  Sure.  He wears that all...  He's very loyal.  He's my biggest  like promotions guy.  He tells everybody.  Anybody and everybody.  I say,  you know O.B. and Anthony?  I can say  he's my son now  because he's rich.  Before he was... 
[03:16:00]  Before what?  Before he was  my stepson  because he wasn't rich.  That was a burden.  Oh, God damn, Sal.  That's unbelievable.  As soon as Anthony  came back in 2002  with that contract,  Sal threw his arms up.  My son.  My boy.  Were you watching?  That's my boy.  Look at that.  Sal, you want to  hold your grandson?  I hold him all the time. 
[03:16:30]  A little pumpkin.  In fact, tomorrow night  we're babysitting.  Oh, really?  I'll never get to  touch the baby  because Roe will  have that baby.  It'll be glued  to her chest.  Oh.  Don't hold on.  Not that part.  I'm actually  officiating a wedding  tomorrow night.  Oh, you are?  Yeah.  And if anybody wants  their wedding  officiated by me,  they can find me  at myspace.com  slash easy  New York weddings  or you can email me  at reverenddawnweddings  at gmail.com.  How many have you done? 
[03:17:00]  Do you do divorces?  This will be my  I don't deal with that part.  God, Sal rules.  Fucking rules.  He's quick.  How many weddings?  This will be my fourth.  Look at you.  Yeah.  Your fourth wedding.  She actually performs  marriage weddings.  I'm a real officiant.  Yeah.  An officiant?  Yeah.  A reverend.  You're a reverend.  Yeah.  Can you do anything else  but weddings?  Like, can you get up  and start your own church  or something?  I probably could, 
[03:17:30]  but I wouldn't have  the slightest idea  how to get started.  What about taxes?  Find a building.  Oh, you know,  the whole tax thing.  I don't know.  That's a little scary.  I haven't investigated that,  but it may be a good option.  You can open up  a non-profit church  in your house,  the Church of Dawn.  Yeah.  And people can just  stop by  and learn  big Long Island  hair tips.  And the whole  unwed mother thing.  Unwed mother thing,  yeah.  Aunt Jokes,  but my dad did  exactly that, man.  You may not have a job. 
[03:18:00]  You better open up  a church sometime.  As far as I know,  I'm going back Monday.  Hopefully my company  will still be there.  It's been very rough  on Wall Street.  We'll see.  Well, Wall Street,  Main Street.  There you go.  Bush just told us  everything's going to be okay,  so we're fine.  Oh, did he?  How is it affecting the market?  Oh, it's going back down.  He said we got the tool,  so.  Yeah.  Yeah, we got the tool  in the White House.  Still down from yesterday.  Oh, it's Danny, right?  Mets fan?  Yeah.  His name's Danny, right?  Oh, yeah.  He's got something 
[03:18:30]  that he's plugging to.  Danny, come on in  and hang out  with the big boys  for a minute.  There's a little, uh...  What are you plugging, sweetie?  Oh, I'm plugging something  that will not injure me  because I always feel injured.  Actually, if you look  at the paper,  it'll explain to you more.  My sister is doing a charity.  She's trying to raise money  for a food pantry  in our neighborhood.  For a food pantry?  Yeah, she's raising my...  She's trying to get 
[03:19:00]  some food donated  to a food pantry  that's running low.  And a can of beets  fell on my foot.  And it hurt me.  It hurt me.  And I'm suing the beets.  Last time we talked to Danny,  he had some crazy ideas.  What was he talking about?  You don't hate...  You hate houses  that have two doors and...  Well, what it is  is I think they're making too many...  I think they're building  too many duplexes  in my neighborhood.  And that makes you  very angry, right?  Oh, yeah, it does.  I really think  it's overpopulating 
[03:19:30]  the neighborhood.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, I think it is.  Two for the price...  Yeah, because it's  two families moving  into one house  kind of a thing?  Yeah, and there's  way too many Mexicans  in my neighborhood.  That's what it was.  I was waiting for that.  I forgot about the Mexicans.  Too many Mexicans?  Yeah, he doesn't like  Mexicans, Sal.  I don't mind Mexicans.  I just don't like  too many of them.  What's the problem  with having too many Mexicans?  Too many.  What happens when...  And when is it too many?  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  The neighborhood  starts smelling bad.  That's what happens.  Now, what does that mean?  Explain yourself, sir.  What, the cooking?  You don't appreciate  Mexican cooking,  the smell of the food?  What is it?  I like the smell of the food.  I just think it's a problem  when you go to a deli  and you order  a pastrami sandwich  with rye on...  with rye bread  and then they never  heard of rye bread.  Oh, you have to...  The Mexicans have to make  your pastrami sandwich.  That's a little weird.  Everything goes on  a tortilla, right? 
[03:20:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, and they sometimes  very, very rarely  do you find a Mexican  that speaks English  and it's a problem  when you go to a restaurant  and they screw up your order.  I remember once  when I was 15,  I went to a Burger King  and I think I had to go back  four times  before they finally  got the order correct  and my mom was complaining  about the order  and it got messed up.  Wow.  When he said restaurant,  I wasn't expecting  to go to Burger King  or McDonald's.  We went to a restaurant  or Burger King. 
[03:21:00]  Burger King.  They messed up the numbers.  Who would think  in a place like that  that don't have good health?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah,  you...  Never mind my voice.  I'm on a medicine  that I'm trying  to get off of.  Oh, yeah?  What medicine?  I'm on Paxil  and it makes you sound  like you got cotton  in your mouth  in the morning  so I hate it.  Maybe you're not  taking the cotton  out of the bottle.  Maybe you're eating  the cotton.  No, there's no cotton 
[03:21:30]  in the bottle.  Oh, okay, literal guy.  Literal guy.  I think you and Sal  should maybe do  some trading of the pills.  Yeah, maybe you guys  could trade some pills  or something.  That could be  a fun little afternoon  for you.  And I used to have  to take pills  after my operations  and I used to hate  the horse pills.  Yeah, Danny,  what operation  did you have?  I had a urinary system.  What happened was...  I had a urinary system.  What happened was  when I was born,  there was something  wrong with my urinary system. 
[03:22:00]  They did an operation  when I was two  and they messed it up  and because of that,  there was an infection  in my urethra  that nearly killed me.  Wow.  And I've had  two urinary obstructions  over the course  of my life  that nearly killed me.  Did you have a sore penis  when you were a boy?  No, I never had that.  Uncle Paul.  No, I didn't say nothing.  Oh, okay.  Sometimes when there's  a block,  you gotta get in there  and blow air on it.  Siphon it out or something?  Siphon out the book 
[03:22:30]  or how you talk  who cares about me?  I'm just a character.  Go ahead, Danny.  You know what else  I used to hate?  I used to hate  those catheters  they used to have  to stick in me.  Oh, a catheter?  You gotta be catheterized?  They put it up  your pee-pee hole.  I used to hate that.  I used to hate that.  I would still hate it.  Yeah.  What turned a corner for you?  Yeah, what made you  not hate it anymore?  I still hate it.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay. 
[03:23:00]  Not as much as  the Mexicans apparently though  because you won't  go on about it.  Now, how many Mexicans  are too many Mexicans?  Well, I'm not sure.  When you start seeing  more people speak Spanish  than English  then there's a problem.  Oh, right.  That's a reasonable assumption  if you don't like Mexicans.  Do you think  every sign in your neighborhood  should be in English  and not Spanish?  Well, I think  they should be in both  because there's  a real problem  when someone's  trying to read a sign 
[03:23:30]  when they're trying  to read a sign  that says that  they can't do something  and they  and they  and they  and they do  what the sign says  and they can't read it.  Signs, signs  everywhere.  There's signs.  Blocking up the scenery.  Do this, don't do that.  Can't you read  the sign, Mexican?  Ugh.  The other problem is  Uh-oh, another problem.  New problem, yes.  There's another problem.  The other problem  is that they  they defecate  on the sidewalks a lot. 
[03:24:00]  They even defecate  on my mother's front lawns.  Why do they do that?  I don't know why.  I've actually seen it before.  You have.  Are you sure  you're not just thinking  of like German shepherds?  Yeah, maybe it's a dog.  It could be a dog.  Too many Germans  in the neighborhood  and they all have  the flocks of sheep apparently.  No, no, no.  You're getting it wrong, son.  Well, I don't see it  in the neighborhood  I live in now  but the old neighborhood  I used to live in  I used to see it happen  in front of my mother's house  but many times.  You would make a duty 
[03:24:30]  in the rug?  You would watch them  take a dump on your lawn?  No, they wouldn't do it.  They would actually  I actually caught one  unzipping  and defecating  right in front of the fence.  You sure it wasn't Sal  trying to find the studio?  I'm sure it wasn't.  I had a go!  Didn't Sal say  he took a leak  on someone's lawn  this morning?  I had a go!  Or in the garage?  Alright.  Of course I admit  when I'm riding  with my cousin  and I have to go  I will defecate  in somewhere  by a bushing  on the LAE. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah, well  who hasn't, right?  As opposed to a restroom.  Well, sometimes  you can't find them,  right Danny?  I'm with you.  Yeah, exactly.  Sometimes you can't  find them  when you really need them.  You know what helps,  so if you really  have to shit  I always bring  my pants and underwear  with me  and just shit into them.  Alright, so  where's the plug  for the pantry thing?  I don't have it.  Did someone give  you the paper?  Hey, by the way  the Mets are out of it. 
[03:25:30]  You're a huge Mets fan.  Who are you rooting for now?  I'm rooting for  anybody but the Phillies.  You hate the Phillies, huh?  They are real assholes  those fans.  I have a friend of mine  who went to an away game  in Philly  and he got his ass kicked  and I'm very mad  at those Philly fans.  Why did he get his ass kicked?  What did he do?  He was just wearing  his full Mets gear.  That's all he was doing.  They kicked him down  the stairs  and his shoes fell off  and his head  was bashed upon. 
[03:26:00]  He shouldn't be wearing  a full Mets uniform  down in Philadelphia.  They hurt me  with their words.  Hey, there's  about a lot  of other people  that do that  and they don't get  their ass kicked.  No?  Well, another good point.  Good point.  Probably they're bigger guys  or something,  I'm thinking, right?  Danny's growing on me.  I like Danny a lot.  He annoyed me at first  but you're growing on me.  Yep, I'm a huge fan  of the show  as I said before.  Well, of course.  Who isn't?  Danny, our Danny  seems a little perturbed.  Danny, what's the matter?  We're trying to find 
[03:26:30]  the plug, that's all.  Who should have  had the plug for us?  What's going on?  Well, let me just say it first.  Why would this mic work?  The plug sheet  that was handed to us  by the other Danny here.  It's just a messy printout  so I just want to  consolidate it  into something easy.  Yeah, we're trying  to figure out  what the basic plug is.  I'm not really sure  about it  because my sister  just started it.  Yeah?  It's a community pantry?  And what does this do?  It gathers food up  like canned foods  for hungry people?  Yes, it does  and it also is trying  to get it for dogs. 
[03:27:00]  My sister has  my sister has a dog.  What, do they just  make them fight it out  in the pantry?  No, what it is  is that there's  a lot of people  that have dogs  that can't afford  the food.  Sal wants in.  Sal.  Is that where  the dogs  can shit on the lawn?  Yeah, that's where  the shit comes from.  Maybe if you don't  feed the dogs so much  you won't get  what you appear  to think is Mexican shit  on your lawn.  Hey, Danny,  how could you  hate Mexicans  but like the Mets  by the way? 
[03:27:30]  I think they got  a lot of Hispanics  on the team.  I don't hate  all Mexicans  just the ones  that keep sneaking  in the border.  Oh, they're  illegals, right?  Yeah, those are  the only ones  I can't stand  are illegals.  You see them  in your neighborhood  waiting for jobs  and stuff  at the Home Depot?  Oh, I see them  sometimes by 69th Street  and Woodside  right by the train station.  Yeah, yeah.  You like blacks  though, right?  Oh, I got great  respect for them.  I went to  Hillcrest High School  in Jamaica, Queens. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah.  So I've seen  plenty of blacks.  I went to a black school.  Oh, you did?  So you have  a lot of respect.  I have a lot  of respect for them.  How'd they treat you  in the black school?  They treated me  very nice.  Oh, good.  Very good.  It's the Mexicans  you don't like.  Some of them.  Some of them, right.  We almost have the plug.  He handed in  about five or six pages  off a website  or something.  Danny's going nuts  trying to figure this out.  My mother printed it out.  Your mother?  Oh, okay.  Yeah, so as a matter of fact, 
[03:28:30]  if you want to call her,  she'll tell you more about it.  You want me to read  the number?  No.  Her phone number?  No, don't read  that phone number.  Not on the air.  No, because others  may call.  All right, Danny's  phone mom's number  is seven.  No.  Wow, is that your mom?  Wait, whose picture  is that?  That is my mother  with the previous dog  we had.  She passed away.  Oh, look at those  oven mitts. 
[03:29:00]  Very nice.  Yeah, so that's  a jar of gif.  If you can dial  that number,  she'll tell you  more about it.  Yeah.  Oh, should we get  Danny's mom  on the phone, maybe?  Let's do that.  Someone call Danny's mom.  Maybe we should  call Danny's mom.  Have her on the phone  to further explain  this charity.  She knows more about it  than I do.  Sounds like a noble cause.  Canned goods for  people and dogs  in the same pantry.  And how is this  supposed to work?  Like, are you supposed 
[03:29:30]  to donate money  or are you supposed  to go somewhere  with cans of food?  You don't know?  Danny's trying to  write down...  He's not sure, though.  What I had wanted  to do...  No, that's it.  I gave this task  to our intern, David,  to consolidate  this mess of words  into something easy  that the show  could handle as a plug.  And this is what  he gave me.  It's basically...  It's like a book report.  Oh, my God, it is.  There's no information here. 
[03:30:00]  There's nothing.  There's no contact.  There's no anything.  So, Danny's hoping  that people donate  on October 25th  at 8 a.m.  at Blessed Virgin Mary Church  in Woodside, New York?  Yeah, that's correct.  Checks payable  to St. Mary's Church.  Canned goods or money  is what you guys  are looking for.  Right?  All right.  That sounds nice.  Why are we bringing  David in here?  David?  And now he shakes his head  no.  What's wrong, David?  Nothing.  They told me that  you were talking about  me to come in here. 
[03:30:30]  No, we were just asking  about the plugs.  Talking about the plug sheet,  we figured you were  trying to figure that out.  Yeah, I got it in.  Holy shit.  David, I don't know  if you got it right, though.  Dave.  I didn't?  No, I don't think so.  Well, see,  usually on a plug sheet  you want specific information  like where, when.  Yeah, I wrote where it is.  It's October 25th.  That's where?  It's on October Street.  It's at the church.  The church at Woodside.  The church, yeah.  It's at the church.  October Street. 
[03:31:00]  It's at the Christian Church  of St. Mary's in Woodside.  Yeah, and what are they  looking for exactly?  They're looking for  new and unused cans of food  so that they can help  the homeless pets  and the pets that are sick.  So what am I supposed to do?  Wait, homeless pets  or homeless people?  Bring in food to the church.  Actually, it's both.  Either bring in food  or donations of money.  So where should I make  my check payable to?  You can make a payable  to the church at Woodside  or to the girls  to the girls' house  in Maspeth.  Well, he's got it all down. 
[03:31:30]  You didn't have to memorize it.  You could have cheated.  Yeah, what you could have done  is actually converted  some of that information  to this piece of paper  and that would have worked  as far.  I love that.  All right.  Hip-Hop Ron,  you will teach Dave  how to do a proper plug sheet  sometime after the show today.  You can't do it either.  Ron doesn't like David.  Ron, how come you don't like David?  Because he's absolutely  useless around here.  But he's giving us  good radio, though.  Yeah, David,  what do you think of that?  Charge.  What's up?  Ron says you're useless  around here.  I know.  I stopped listening to Ron  a long time ago. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, why?  Why is that?  Wow.  It's always good  when insubordinates  don't listen to people  above them.  Ooh.  And we've got a baby cry.  Yes?  David.  Yes, Jimmy?  Now, he's saying  that it's always good  when he's being sarcastic.  He's saying that you're  a subordinate  and you should listen.  What do you say?  What's your comment?  I don't know where  this all came from,  to be quite honest.  He started like,  it's like the second day  that I started interning here,  he started to feel  that way about me.  What do you feel about that?  I didn't really have  an opinion about him 
[03:32:30]  after day two.  I still was getting  to know him.  Do you think that he  does a lot around here?  He does some stuff, yeah.  I think the honest...  Wait a minute,  I'll put my mom  on the phone right now.  I think the honest...  If I may be honest,  I think the honest truth  is he's jealous  because I've been here  for four weeks  and I've had more bits  than he has  in like three months.  Oh!  Wow.  I think that's the honest truth.  Very honest truth.  It's right.  It's not like I don't hate him  because he's useless.  I hate him because  people write bits for him  that he doesn't contribute  to at all.  Oh.  Oh.  Well,  if you must know, 
[03:33:00]  the kosher sports today,  half of the kosher sports  today was written by me.  Half.  No kidding.  That's right.  No kidding.  If you must know,  that's right.  Yeah.  Which was your...  Half was today...  Hold on, hold on.  What was your favorite line  that you wrote today  for kosher sports?  Half was written by me  saying perhaps next time  the whole entire thing  will be written by me.  Perhaps.  No, no.  That'll be the last kosher sports.  Will you answer my question  for once?  Yes.  A line that you read  that you liked today.  That I wrote  or that Kenny wrote?  That you wrote.  Oh, mine that I wrote  was I like about  the one I wrote  about Intifada. 
[03:33:30]  That was my line.  Your line?  Exactly.  You know,  before he has to leave,  I know he's very important  and stuff,  I just want to  let everybody know.  Mookie Wilson, everybody.  Yeah.  Mookie!  Mookie's here.  Great to see you.  Wow.  Fuck.  What?  Shit.  What?  I thought...  No?  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, man.  Ew.  Some uncomfortable  laughter and applause.  Why?  Why did you shoot  Samuel Jackson 
[03:34:00]  in Jungle Fever?  You're my son  and I love you  but you're evil.  Oh, yeah, okay.  All right.  Are we getting  Danny's mom on the phone?  I'm trying.  We're trying to get  your mom on the phone  there, Danny.  Okay.  Yeah, the captain  of the Reliant.  Anything else bothering you?  Come on, Rathacon.  Nothing else.  Nothing else?  It's just the Mexicans  and the duplexes, right?  Way too many of them.  Yeah, we got that point.  We're running out of space.  What are we supposed to do? 
[03:34:30]  Well, simple.  Find another location.  Find another county.  Another county?  How about just stay in Mexico?  Oh, wait a minute.  I thought of a better idea.  Oh.  How about Mastic?  Sal, he wants duplexes  where you buy cigarettes.  I gotta go get my cigarettes out there.  Simple, simple.  They, they, they, they, they, they, they could, they could build, they, they, they, the audience 
[03:35:00]  is ruthless.  They, they, they can build them on top of the duplexes.  They can build what on top of the duplexes?  They, they, they could build the duplexes on top of the stores.  I, I see it all the time.  And they, they could, they could build the houses on top of the stores.  So the cigarette stores and then the duplexes on top.  Yeah, exactly.  So you'll be stacking up Indians and Mexicans.  Exactly.  Right.  Exactly.  They, I, I have a problem with this store in my neighborhood. 
[03:35:30]  Oh, you do?  Yeah, there, there's this one where there's these people that I think they're from, they're  from some Middle Eastern country.  And they, and they always hate it when I use the credit card at their store.  Really?  Yeah, they, they seem to always, like, have this look like, uh, and one of them.  Wait, hold on, Dave.  What look is that?  They have this look like, uh.  I love it.  And then they start saying some curse.  And then they start saying some curse. 
[03:36:00]  And I don't know what language they're speaking.  Yeah.  Exactly.  It's Mexican.  I, I can tell by the look on their face that they're not happy with the credit card  thing, huh?  Yeah, yeah, that's right.  Is it a credit card or is it one of those, like, cards they send you in the mail, the  junk mail credit card?  With, like, any town USA?  Is that one of those?  No, it's actually my mother's credit card.  My mom actually asked me to get stuff for her.  Nice.  Oh.  Speaking of food that smells.  Why don't you pick me up a little something down at the store? 
[03:36:30]  Speaking of food that smells, it's the Indians that have the bad smelling food.  Oh, yeah, you.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, I remember.  I can tell you, if you ever go to 74th Street, that whole neighborhood smells like curry.  If you go to 74th Street, Roosevelt Avenue in Queens.  That's where I'm getting that.  The whole neighborhood smells like curry, I swear.  They got the bad smelling food there, Danny.  You really have a lot to say about race.  But, but I have to admit, though, I also, I also noticed there was a lot of Indians in  the school, and they were very nice, but some of them, some of them, some of them seem 
[03:37:00]  to be a little bit, seem to have a little bit of a problem.  What kind of problem?  I don't know.  Like, like, they seem to hate us.  Yeah.  I hate the sand.  Also, I know this, some of their food is good, I have to admit.  Yeah, yeah.  If you ever tried a chicken curry, it's very, it's very good.  It's very good.  Yeah, you like that stuff?  Oh, yeah. 
[03:37:30]  I'm not a big curry fan.  I've had it before.  The only problem is you want, you want, you want to drink it with the soda to get the,  to balance out the curry breath.  I'm sure the soda just takes the curry breath right away, that's sugar.  Yup, yup, it does.  Thank you, creature from Sesame Street.  Yup, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.  Why don't we have, why don't we have, I can actually do that.  I can actually impersonate the yip, yips.  Can you do that, please?  Yeah, let's hear it.  Yeah.  Yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, rock, yip,  yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip. 
[03:38:00]  Hello.  Wow.  That was amazing.  He does these impersonations.  That was more Mexican.  Wasn't it that it wasn't Mexican?  Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Should we have E-Rock smell his breath to make sure that...  It's not curry?  It's not curry.  Would you mind, Danny?  No, he should.  Sure, no problem. 
[03:38:30]  He might find garlic buttersaw in that breath.  Oh, faced E-Rock.  Look at that.  Where's the E-Rock today?  I don't know.  Where is he?  He can't be working, so look anywhere work isn't being done, and he'll be there.  Wherever the treadmill is, just walk away from that direction.  Ah, here it goes, E-Rock.  E-Rock, you've got to smell Danny's breath today.  Oh, my God.  Hold on, Ronnie, you said my...  Now, uh...  Hold on, Danny.  It shouldn't be that bad. 
[03:39:00]  I mean, the guy seems to take care of himself.  Go.  Nice one.  E-Rock, you're too far away.  Get closer.  Get right in his mouth.  What is it?  It's not bad.  It's just like...  Give him a kiss.  Kiss him.  Oh, it smells like an attic.  Like an attic?  Yeah, like if you haven't been in an attic in a long time...  New or old attic, yeah.  ...that musky kind of smell.  Oh, okay.  But wouldn't that classify as bad?  Yeah.  It's not...  Not like hideous. 
[03:39:30]  That girl was hot.  She had attic breath.  Look at who's the judge.  That's true.  Better the eyes than the outhouse.  He probably just smelled the hot chocolate I drank this morning.  That's what he smelled.  I'm sure he did.  Okay.  Well, uh...  Man.  We're gonna, um...  What?  Look at E-Rock's shoe slippers?  Oh, we got his plug out, I guess.  Where are those?  Yeah, we got his plug out, right?  Yeah.  I don't think we're getting your mom on the phone today, Danny.  I want to talk to your mom one of these days.  You're here all the time.  All right.  Well, next time I'm here, I'll try to put her on the phone. 
[03:40:00]  Okay.  Can I ask you a question?  Oh, wait a minute.  I'll try to call her now.  No, no.  Not now, Danny.  No, that's okay.  Not now, Danny.  Not now, Danny.  Danny, can I ask you a question?  What do you keep in your backpack?  Probably a shotgun.  No.  No, actually, I just keep the newspapers I get.  Newspapers?  You read newspapers?  Yeah, of course I do.  Oh, I thought he put them down on the lawn for the Mexicans.  No.  No.  Hey, Danny, all right, you read newspapers.  What did you read in the newspaper today? 
[03:40:30]  I actually read about a situation that happened with Jimmy.  Yes, that was in the paper.  Let's ask Danny.  What happened to Jimmy?  For the people that haven't heard yet.  I didn't hear this, but I heard someone over at Ex-Im try to sue you.  Right.  Keep going.  Over something you said.  Right.  And I have to tell you, this guy does not know how to take a joke.  Yep.  Very good.  That's pretty much what happened.  I agree.  I'm with you on that one.  What else did you read in the paper today?  This is our news segment with Danny. 
[03:41:00]  I also read the sports section.  I happen to be a huge fan of the Giants in addition to being a fan of the Mets.  Big Blue.  So you're happy with the Phillies, right?  You want the Phillies to go.  Yeah, you like the Phillies.  I want the Phillies to lose.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  So you like Big Blue.  Yeah, that's correct.  So did my father, God rest his soul.  So he got you to be a Giants fan.  Yep.  At least he could be proud up in heaven that at least he did that.  He was a Yankee fan, so he could be at least proud that I became a Giants fan. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah.  I'm sure he's proud of you for other reasons.  You're a nice guy.  You're a nice boy.  Yeah.  Did you like our David Tyree interview earlier this week?  Oh, I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear it this week.  He was the guy that caught the ball, the big play, right?  I actually know that, but I didn't hear the interview.  I missed it.  It was great.  It's called The Catch, right?  The Catch.  More than just the catch.  See, then the title on the book, it was More Than Just The Catch.  That's pretty much what it was. 
[03:42:00]  A whole book that ran up to that catch.  That must be amazingly good.  That's a fascinating reading.  Chapter five, step seven towards the catch.  You're not far off.  That's exactly what we were doing.  The Bret Hart book, you compare that to the David Tyree book?  Oh, boy.  Bret Hart filled up every inch of the page.  David Tyree had the biggest margins ever in a book.  By the way, is the interview going to be on one of the worst of the week this weekend? 
[03:42:30]  It just might.  That might have made it.  All right.  By the way, what time is the Sam and Thans show?  I just got the XM, so I don't know what time it's on.  What time is the Sam and Thans show?  I don't know what that show is, but if you want to tune in to Sam and Sam, that's going to be this Saturday at 9 p.m. on this here channel, XM202, and also Sirius 197.  Hey, everybody, Creepy Gay Kid is here!  Yay!  Creepy Gay Kid!  Creepy Gay Kid!  By the way, I want to see if Sam...  Hold on, Danny.  Hold on. 
[03:43:00]  Creepy Gay Kid has made an appearance.  We feel special today.  Sorry, Danny.  It can't be about you all the time.  Yeah.  I understand.  Oh, geez.  Here comes the gun.  Taking his backpack off.  I'm actually going to bring my wallet and see if Sam can hide it in his hair for an hour.  That's a good one.  Creepy Gay Kid.  Shush.  Creepy Gay Kid.  I like this guy that's some bits.  Yeah, he's actually coming up with bit ideas.  I actually have a whole list of bit ideas at home.  Oh, wow.  Bring them in next week. 
[03:43:30]  Bring them in.  Here, stick it in your hair.  It's funny.  And give it back to me in an hour.  All right.  Back an hour?  You guys see it?  Well, I need to see if you can really hide this thing in your hair for a long period of time.  All right.  And I think an hour is long enough to see how long it can go without falling out.  Yeah.  Okay.  If it falls out, he loses.  But what if it doesn't fall out?  But he can't even get it in his hair.  If it falls out, then he has to sing Chocolate Rain in front of my sister who's annoyed by the song. 
[03:44:00]  While she flaps her asshole at him.  As a matter of fact, my sister has a challenge.  Uh-oh.  What's that?  She's 13, and she wants to do something.  Hey, hold on.  She wants to challenge me on Halloween with a candy contest.  Really?  She wants to take two bowls and see two big, you know, your typical size candy bowls.  Yeah.  And fill them up with Snickers and Milky Ways.  And see if we can both finish it by the end of the first half of the K-Rock half. 
[03:44:30]  Show.  Show.  Well, you guys are very unhealthy.  You're going to get sick.  Let me tell you something.  If she needs a place to stay during this.  Oh, my God.  What?  What?  I was just offering.  Sal's here.  I was just offering.  Sal's here.  Something.  Your stepfather's here.  I didn't tell.  It's Halloween.  Anthony dresses like a sugar daddy.  No, I'm actually thinking of dressing like Tippy Tom. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah?  Oh, really?  I'd like to see that.  I think we're doing a Halloween party this year.  Shit your pants.  Costume done.  Why not?  I'm actually trying to look for...  Could somebody email me a picture of Tippy Tom I could use for reference?  Yeah, we could do that.  Actually, there's a photo right outside.  If you could walk right out there behind the bleachers, you could see the photo.  What's happening to my...  Does Bennington just spin around in this chair all day?  Is that what he does?  But my headphones are wrapped around the bottom of this chair what has to be 50 times. 
[03:45:30]  What happened?  It's like...  How does that happen, Anthony?  I don't know.  What are you doing?  Why are you doing that?  Amazing.  What's wrong with you?  Anthony, why?  I don't know.  Talk to us.  What's up?  It happens to me too.  All right, you go right ahead.  Is that a joke?  I'm going to show you what one of my screensavers looks like.  Oh, we can't wait, Danny.  Oh, my God.  Sorry, Danny.  I actually took this picture a little bit earlier.  This is endless.  A screensaver?  Yep.  It's actually a wallpaper.  A wallpaper. 
[03:46:00]  What is it of, Danny?  It's just...  What is it?  What is it?  It's Opie and Jimmy.  Oh.  Very nice.  Thank you.  I'm left out, but I don't really mind.  Actually, I'll take a picture of both of you right at the end of the show.  I'll take a picture of both of you.  Take a picture with Opie and Anthony.  You between Opie and Anthony.  And that's your screensaver.  It's you between...  That'd be very nice.  All right.  As a matter of fact, I need to take a picture of my digital camera for my photo album.  You got a digital camera in there too?  I got it in my backpack.  Of course you do.  I always carry my backpack because it makes it easier to carry everything. 
[03:46:30]  Sure.  It's all in one.  It's like a trunk, only without the car.  Right.  And it doesn't hang on the front of your face.  Yeah.  It's like a trunk without the car.  I've never heard a backpack...  It's like a womb, actually.  No.  Actually, that's...  A womb without the cunt around it.  Actually, the womb would be on the front, not the back.  Oh, my good God.  All right, Danny.  How about we...  Yes, and also in a woman giving birth, not lunking trinkets.  Thanks, Danny, for stopping by. 
[03:47:00]  Thank you.  Danny, thank you so much.  We'll see you after the show.  We're just going to wrap up with two minutes here.  Wow.  Creepy Gay Kid's off the hook, I guess.  Creepy Gay Kid, you got any stunts for everybody today?  We got a nice studio audience.  Thank you, Danny.  Or do you just need Bobby here for your gayness?  Yeah, I mean, there's nobody here that likes me the way Bob likes me.  That's true.  That is some love going on there.  So we're not going to get anything from Creepy Gay Kid today?  I don't know.  You got this bit called Creepy Gay Kid steals that guy's wallet. 
[03:47:30]  That's true.  I saw him pocket that thing.  It's over.  All right.  I think we will hit line of the day then.  Can I plug something?  Of course.  It's my first L.A. shows, headline shows ever.  They're going on sale this morning, 10 a.m. L.A. time.  Stop it.  I'm doing the Viper Room on Sunset.  It's a very, very small room, but I'm really looking forward to this.  December 12th and 13th.  That is cool. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You go to ViperRoom.com to get tickets.  It's 21 and over, unfortunately, because it's all liquor.  But those are my first ever headline shows in L.A.  I was just going to say, normally there are, in the comedy world, a lot of people don't know this,  there's the New York comics and the L.A. comics.  Yeah.  And they don't usually mix or anything like that.  So it's very, very good for you to have both cities.  Huge.  Yeah.  I mean, I did time at the comedy store when I was out there.  You're right.  My point. 
[03:48:30]  The Viper Room's doing comedy, though.  That's where River Phoenix, you know, bought it.  Yeah.  That's where the first.  Me and Florentine saw Seven Dust there in the early 90s.  I mean, before there were anything.  It's like a legendary rock room.  Yeah.  But guys do that in L.A.  Like when Dice did one of his albums at the Roxy, Chris Rock, I think, did the Roxy.  It's a small room.  And this is a small room.  Does Johnny Depp still own it?  I honestly don't know.  I think he does.  He might have sold it by now.  I hope he does.  I'd love to have him stop in.  Maybe be a character.  I'd be like, hey, do the Keith Richards thing.  Oh, hello. 
[03:49:00]  Come on.  I'm an actor, too.  Let's be pirates.  Down and Dirty tonight, too.  Midnight.  HBO.  Yes.  HBO.  I hope we did very well the first week.  I was very happy.  Oh, good, good, good.  I've got good news from HBO, so I want to do more.  Yeah.  Yeah, it goes out until 10 a.m. L.A. time.  That's December 12th, 13th.  Two shows Friday, two Saturday.  Very small room.  It's like 400 tickets total.  Wasn't something bothering you when we first started, but then we got distracted with Dawn's?  Oh, yeah.  I'll deal with that next week.  It's not that big a deal.  It's some guy that, he didn't trash me hard, but he wrote something about me that I didn't 
[03:49:30]  like.  Although it's not the fact that he doesn't like me.  I'm fine with that.  All right.  And you've got a lawsuit to deal with.  A frivolous lawsuit.  With that stupid lawyer interview.  It's amazing.  I have no feelings about that whatsoever.  None.  It's more annoying that the legal system has to do with that kind of garbage.  I think I should fucking call the show.  That's what he should do.  It's just, to me, any type of attention-seeking garbage that you have to get the legal system  involved in, it's like deal with your childhood issues and fucking get on with your life. 
[03:50:00]  There you go.  Stop it, baby.  Sal, anything?  That's about it.  I think I'm ready for a nap.  Yeah.  That's it.  See?  Sal's perfect for this business.  No kidding.  You blurt out some funny shit and you go to sleep.  That's right.  That's pretty much it.  When are you going to start?  That's the life.  You started today.  There you go.  When are you going to start?  Oh, shit.  Oh, damn.  Snap.  Oh, shit.  Sal.  That was a yoke.  He puts his fist up in victory. 
[03:50:30]  I nailed you, asshole.  I'll take it, Sal.  That's fine.  That's for not driving me in today.  I know.  I understand.  Why would you drive Sal in?  He misunderstood.  He thought I was coming over last night.  Last night.  What the fucking shit?  Because a company was over.  Yeah, he was a friend.  Hanging out.  But Sandy was there.  But Sal told us he likes to watch.  Really?  That's what he said.  Like a watch?  Sal likes to watch? 
[03:51:00]  You said you like to watch.  No, I said I like a watch.  I need a watch.  Christmas watch.  Yeah.  All right.  Anthony understands me speaking in Maryland.  Of course.  I've heard it for so many years.  We're going on the boat.  All right.  We did go on the boat.  Remind me of what we did after the two-day blackout.  Yeah.  Sal could back a boat.  What size was the boat?  36 with a 14-foot beam.  Yeah, 14-foot beam.  Jesus.  And he'd back it into the slip at Watch Hill. 
[03:51:30]  Tanked.  Just tanked off Canadian Club.  And he wouldn't even hit one of the poles.  It was just...  It was amazing, wasn't it?  It was amazing.  Absolutely amazing.  I was amazed.  You missed your boat?  And then we'd drink like a motherfucker.  They'd be feeding me Canadian club as I'm doing this.  Yeah.  It worked every time.  And then we'd drink like crazy the whole weekend.  The band would be out there.  We'd play out at Watch Hill.  Where's that?  No, it's in Fire Island.  Yeah, across from like Patchogue around there. 
[03:52:00]  And then every time we had to go back on Sunday, I don't know why, but like clockwork,  the weather was awful.  And I was so hungover and just a puke fest.  It was so good going there and so bad coming back.  I liked it when we went Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, whatever, and in between it, a lot  of people would leave.  Remember what the song they were singing?  Do you remember?  Oh, yes.  Na, na, na, na. 
[03:52:30]  Na, na, na, na.  Hey, hey, hey.  Then the home marina was singing.  Oh, it was like a musical.  Yeah, it was great.  Great days.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  Good times.  My liquor bill was bigger than my gas bill.  Just to see.  Oh, my God.  See, those were the days.  Not these days.  No.  No.  Light.  No.  A little wine.  All right.  Well, Sal, thank you so much for stopping in and hanging out. 
[03:53:00]  Thank you.  Sal's fantastic.  I only came to listen.  Now that I'm a star, I'll be here whenever you want.  He'll be doing third mic when Jimmy's away.  He is such a star.  It'd be funny that he fucking eased in and undercut me and I got dumped.  He's a problem, I'm telling you.  We love the Sal guy.  You'd probably sue me because we're related.  Yeah.  Conflict of interest.  He'll go to Greenstein and get me dumped.  He likes transsexuals.  It's nepotism.  All right.  Line of the day time. 
[03:53:30]  Line of the day.  Webex.com.  Hold meetings.  Make presentations.  Do it from the comfort of your own home or office.  Check it out at Webex.com.  Here is the first of many runner-up lines of the day.  Put it this way.  This guy, to me, is a creepy old guy trying to get young chicks.  And for me to say that?  Wow.  Nice.  Ah, yes.  Very good.  Right to the next runner-up line of the day.  Said, yeah, it wasn't Jesus. 
[03:54:00]  It wasn't the Son of God.  Denounced his religion.  And went Jew for a little while.  Well, you've got to do that for pussy.  I mean, come on.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Got away with one on regular radio today.  You know, got to slip men every so often.  Webex.com.  Another runner-up line of the day.  Self-proclaimed.  Self-proclaimed.  Oh, are we going to have to dump that?  Why?  I'm teasing, of course.  Self-proclaimed.  I didn't do a good job of reading. 
[03:54:30]  Yes.  Is that three ready?  Yeah.  One more runner-up line.  I mean, you're not going to go to, like, Jewish hell, would you?  If you ate on that day?  Yeah, that's a bad...  That's not...  That's also called Anthony's house.  Oh, you got a good one.  Yeah.  I want to thank the audience.  They're coming out in droves on a Friday.  Nice.  Yes.  How many are sticking around? 
[03:55:00]  A few.  Get the fuck out.  That'll be a whole new crew, I guarantee.  I want to thank Dawn and her big tits for stopping by.  Oh, jeez.  Should we have Dawn say goodbye in or what?  Where's the kid?  Where's Warren?  Where's little Warren Dean?  Where's Warren Jerome?  Breastfeeding?  He's being fed.  Who the fuck is Warren Dean?  That was Tweety, you assholes.  You want to know who Warren Dean is?  Chris, do they know who Warren Dean was in history? 
[03:55:30]  Who?  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, no.  No, no.  All right.  Oh, no.  No, Opie, Steve will have that tomorrow.  Easy.  Jerry made it the joke once.  I got it.  Twice is even funnier.  Easy.  You watching TV?  And I had a good feds line anyway.  Yeah.  Warren Dean was an environmental historian. 
[03:56:00]  Did you guys know this?  No.  What was historic about his environmental stuff?  Whose publications on the sociology of Brazil and the destruction of its rainforest received  wide acclaim as models of tree hugger.  Why are little Warren's eyes so wide?  He's so creeped out by hip-hop Ron.  It's pathetic.  That's what it is.  He's looking at hip-hop Ron.  He's a Republican.  He's watching McCain.  Oh, really?  Oh, you guys are into the McCain, too, over there?  Hmm?  McCain?  No.  I'm a Democrat. 
[03:56:30]  I'm voting.  Obama?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we're going to sway in that way these days.  Oh, God.  It's one thing if his radio partners are possibly thinking Obama.  He doesn't want to hear...  Family members.  No, I think I'm the lone one in the family.  The second you pull that voting lever, there's going to be graves with spinning bodies of our  family members in there.  Yeah, I'm kidding.  Let me tell you.  All the uncles and aunts and grandparents are just going to spin.  I know.  I keep getting emails from, like, Uncle Tony and stuff.  Are you the only one in the whole... 
[03:57:00]  Updates on Obama.  She voted for one of them?  A Democrat?  See, I kind of turned it around instead of saying...  Cock.  Cock meat.  Oh, that's good, too.  Cock meat.  That was supposed to be a beep, but cock meat's just as good.  I'm under the weather.  Yes, I'm sickly.  I'm wearing a robe.  Oh, what?  We didn't explain.  Oh, no, that sounded like it was going to be good.  Not really.  The weather is a guy that lives in the neighborhood.  I'm under the weather.  I'm under him.  Peter Weather.  He lives down the street. 
[03:57:30]  That's right.  His weather vane leaks into my mouth.  When he points it southwest, I make cumzies all over my leg.  My Lebanese shaved leg.  Peter Weather likes when I shave my thighs.  I'm feeling a little down in the dumper.  I'm feeling down in the syndrome.  Fucking dope.  Where are you?  We didn't even explain why this whole crew is here.  Yeah.  Part of the topless was going to surprise Steve today. 
[03:58:00]  Yep.  That was the big thing.  That's out of the bag, I guess.  Part of the topless.  Well, now it's going to be a thing.  No, you're doing this.  It's not a surprise.  No, we're still doing it.  Now it's going to be a...  Now, Steve, you're doing this.  Yeah, but we were going to do something with Steve and Pendulum today, and Steve called  out sick.  Yeah.  So they've been hanging around.  I didn't call out sick.  I called out incompetent.  Hello.  I won't be doing anything today.  All right.  I'm going to bungle it home.
