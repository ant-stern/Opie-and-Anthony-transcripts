<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show began with Danny filling in for Opie, lamenting technical difficulties and the cancellation of "Whip them out Wednesday" due to its impracticality.  The hosts then critiqued various science shows, including *Mythbusters* (specifically criticizing the on-screen dynamic between the hosts and Grant & Tory), *How It's Made*, *Deconstructed*, and a show featuring someone cutting objects in half with power tools—a show they relentlessly mocked for its catchphrase, "Now that's a slice," which they repeatedly used in crude and vulgar contexts relating to famous murders.  Their critique extended to other shows like *Modern Marvels*, *Top Shot*, and various disliked reality shows, especially those focused on dating.  They previewed their upcoming guests: Doug Stanhope, Frank Lucas, and Louis Black, anticipating potential chaos with Stanhope and Lucas together.  The show included a detailed, vulgar discussion of their sexual preferences and experiences. A discussion about Christina Aguilera's and Lady Gaga's careers and appearances followed, heavily criticizing Aguilera's looks.  The hosts also discussed the impact of the internet on dating and relationships, sharing anecdotes about both successful and disastrous online dating experiences.

The next segment dove deeper into the awkwardness of modern dating, particularly online encounters.  Callers shared stories of uncomfortable transitions from online sexual banter to real-life interactions, difficulties juggling multiple dates (one host recounted a disastrous multi-date experience involving a robe, a piña colada, and an upset woman in a hot tub), and the challenges of post-coital interactions. Callers "Mike" and "Tim" also shared their experiences with online dating and the difficulties of their marriages, respectively.  Caller "Scott" also spoke about his long-term marriage lacking common interests.  Doug Stanhope joined the show in-studio, contrasting his quiet life in Bisbee with his hectic touring schedule, and shared details about his relationship with his bipolar girlfriend.

The focus then shifted to Stanhope's anecdotes about his nieces and nephews, followed by an in-studio interview with Frank Lucas.  The interview covered Lucas's autobiography, his drug operation, his life before and after prison, interactions with law enforcement, money laundering, relationships with other drug figures (like Nicky Barnes), and the accuracy of the film *American Gangster*.  A violent childhood anecdote was also shared.  Lucas's nephew briefly appeared at the end.  The segment also touched upon Frank Lucas’s legal battles, mentioning lawyers Dominic Amorosa and Jeff Hoffman. Jimmy Norton, present in the studio, was praised for his crime knowledge and interview with Lucas, which segued into a discussion of his unusual interest in the smell of new books and electronics.

A significant portion then focused on the departure of Eastside Dave, a former producer from the Ron and Fez show, highlighting his tattoos, a past show segment involving objects in his rectum, and speculation about his underpayment and unfair treatment by the network.  The hosts also discussed their failed attempt to secure an interview with Rampage Jackson and their frustration with perceived unfair treatment compared to other shows on their platform. Dr. Steve was called in to discuss penis pumps and erectile dysfunction.  Comedian Lewis Black briefly promoted his Christmas book.  The segment concluded with a short in-studio interview with Charlto Copley and Quinton "Rampage" Jackson, promoting their film "The A-Team," referencing Jackson’s past role in "Midnight Meat Train".

The final segment featured Copley and Jackson in studio discussing *The A-Team*, with Jackson recounting a fight and past gang encounters.  Copley discussed his role in *District 9*. Jackson detailed his plans to buy an A-Team van and camp outside Mr. T's house and recounted a recent fight where he claimed defeat. The conversation moved to Twitter, escalating into a heated exchange between Jackson and a host about his social media use. This led to a discussion of *Curb Your Enthusiasm*, Eastside Dave's absence (with speculation about his recent marriage and job applications), finances, family planning, abortions, and the guests’ experiences in 1970s New York City.  Jackson described his extensive gun collection, including a .50 caliber rifle, and shared a humorous anecdote about a woman using a spent bullet casing.  The show ended with plugs for the guests' projects, further banter about guns, and the hosts' future plans, including a YouTube video with Jackson.  A news photo from Reuters, allegedly manipulated to portray Israelis negatively, was also briefly discussed.

It's kind of like  Went to the  Wherever  It's time  It's morning  Nobody wants to show their kids  At six in the morning  It was really  Kind of an afternoon-y thing  Wasn't it?  Yeah  You got your  You know, you're boom  You're driving into work  You got your coffee  And your car  Boom, you're trying to show your tits  Just doesn't work in the morning  It's chilly out  Yeah  99% of the year

It's more of a summer  Afternoon-y thing  Yeah  It's fun when you're  On the beach  In the morning  It just feels like  You're getting a  Fucking check for lumps  Yeah  It's very clinical  Yeah  Uh, well, hi  Uh  We're here  Opie  Is taking the day off today  He's taking a day off 
[00:05:30]  Danny is in for the vacationing Opie  As they say on the news  Danny will be sitting  Back there  Hi Dan  Hi  Like when Danny has his mic on  Hi  So he can  Pull out his words of wisdom  Every so often  Now you can hear me  I have those?  Well, alright  So he can just  Blather into the microphone  Every so often  I was watching  Mythbusters  Last night  I finally saw that episode  Where  With the  The guns  Oh, that's an old one now  Where they were shooting  Through water 
[00:06:00]  It is an old one  But I hadn't seen that one  It was shooting  Into water  Trying to  See if the myth was true  That if you  Go swimming underwater  And someone's shooting at you  That the water  Will protect you  And  As it turns out  The higher the caliber  And the bigger the bullet  And the faster the bullet  The more protection  The water gives you  It's amazing  A 9mm handgun  You gotta watch out  That stuff will go right  Into the water  And hurt you  But  They took a 50 cal 
[00:06:30]  I can't believe  I really can't believe  They fired that  I mean after firing it  Shoulder fired  I couldn't believe  That they fired that  Into a pool  I know  Into a pool  And the thing  Just the bullet  Completely broke apart  Before it would have  Hit anybody  Even two feet underwater  It just  A 50 cal fired  I couldn't hit  With the bottom of your pool  No  Not even  At the top of the pool  We should try that  Just a couple of feet under  Why don't we give it a try  At my house  I'm sure the neighbors  Would love that  You know I bet  When the mythbusters  Say like 
[00:07:00]  Don't try this at home  They never thought  That someone would actually  Have a 50 cal  To shoot into their own pool  Have the pool  The 50 cal  Like I have all the stuff  To do it  But I also have  The good sense not to  Not that I wouldn't love to  The laws are the only thing  Really keeping me  Common sense is not  Keeping me from doing that  Because I would absolutely  Like to give it a try  The water came up  Like a depth charge  When he fired into it  To hit the ceiling  Yeah  And then it was just nothing  Just fragments of bullets  But that was fun  And then also in that episode 
[00:07:30]  Was the  Can you swing  Around  The top bar  Of the swing set  Oh do the 360  Yeah do the 360  Which has always been  The thing as a kid  In the playground  Trying to go all the way around  And it just  Is  It's completely impossible  You cannot do it  That chain slacks up  I remember trying it  As a kid  And when the chain  Would slack up  And you'd  Bam  Just  Just a little bit  Just nail your  Fucking back  It's probably why  It's probably why  I have back problems now  Travis likes to give me shit 
[00:08:00]  Because  He likes to make fun  Of all the  Descripted shitty banter  Between them all  But I tell him  I'm like I'm not watching it  For the  You know  For the  For the interaction  Between them  It's terrible  I know  I have heard of this myth  Oh I have also heard of that myth  I like when they  When they bring in the cronies  The secondary unit  I hate  That's another reason  Why I just can't watch that show  I don't mind the secondary unit  I just  I don't like the banter  Between them  That's what I'm talking about  Because then they're talking like  Okay well  What are you going to do about it 
[00:08:30]  No Adam and Jamie are fine  Like I like them  But  But that  Those two guys  In the secondary unit  They're just terrible  You mean Grant and Torrey  Yeah  Grant and Torrey  And yeah  They just have nothing  When they're talking to the big boys  The big bosses  Of Mythbusters  So  How are you going to  Prove or disprove  This myth  I'm not watching it for that  You don't like that part  Well  I watch it for  What they're doing  I don't care really  Who's doing it  As long as it gets done  Yeah  They've had some 
[00:09:00]  They got something going on  Because there have been  Plenty of shows  Where they  They try to do things  I mean  And it just doesn't  Kind of work out  Because there's no  Chemistry between the people  Or something  There's been plenty of shows  Period  I think they're  They're into like  Their seventh season  Or something like that  I think they're wrapping up  Their seventh season  Wow  So I mean  It's not like it's an  Unsuccessful show  Because now  Something's happening  Right  Yeah  Now there's that show  Where a guy just  Cuts shit in half  That's D-Boy's favorite  Now  Now that's a slice  Like I don't 
[00:09:30]  I don't get that show  Really  I do get it  Because on Science Channel  There was a similar show  Called Deconstructed  Deconstructed  I get  Which was basically  Like How It's Made  But it was in reverse  In reverse  Yes  The reverse of How It's Made  How It's Made  Is a show  Where they show  How something's made  And I find it fascinating  They couldn't really call it  How It Comes Apart  They just figured  They call it Deconstructed  Deconstructed  And they take shit apart  But this show  A guy has like  A carborundum saw  And they cut shit in half  Well I think this guy 
[00:10:00]  He's got like the voice  He's got like this  Weird sort of personality  I think they're trying to  Like mold  A brand new Mike Rowe  Oh is that what  They're trying to do  So I think it's kind of like  Oh let's do Deconstructed  With Mike Rowe hosting it  Yeah  And give him a catchphrase  A catchphrase  I don't  I'm not enjoying  The catchphrase  Now that's a slice  Like he cuts it in half  And goes  Now that's a slice  That's horrible  It's a horrible catchphrase  That would be great  If the show was about  Like Al Zarkawi  Yeah 
[00:10:30]  It's  I'm not  I'm not really feeling  That show  There's so many of them  On now though  Like  I don't even know  What started that  I think  Was it Mythbusters  That really kind of  Got that rolling  Or was there something  Before that  That was such a  An industrial  Kind of  Check it out show  That only real geeks  And  Fucking science people watch  Yeah you know what  It's weird  Now you say  I'm thinking about it  And I'm having a lot of time  Coming up with something 
[00:11:00]  There were shows about  Like big trucks and stuff  You'd be able to go  Oh yeah okay  It's a show about  Modern Marvels  Modern Marvels  Yeah  I'll watch that  They're kind of  Do you find they're  Running out of shit though  Yeah when they start doing stuff  Like the real basic things  Like Modern Marvels  Water  Yeah yeah  It's like well can't we do something  A little more like mechanical  It's like the cotton industry  Like I don't really  But you know what  I like the beginning of that episode  But I didn't really like  Oh he didn't  Once  Eli Whitney came around 
[00:11:30]  And figured it all out  Took the fun out of it  Yeah  Although they do find a way  To make all those interesting  Like even though  When you think it's going to be  Some shit you know episode  Like I don't want to watch that  But then 10 minutes into it  And you're like  Oh I have to see how they  How they make pajamas  Like how'd the whole industry  Get born  Bathtubs  I watch the bathroom one  Something on bathrooms  And at first I'm into it  I'm kind of like  Ah fuck  I don't really want to know  What's going on with bathrooms  And toilets and sinks and stuff  And then you find yourself going  This is fucking commercials  This is fascinating 
[00:12:00]  They're vacuum forming  Fucking bathtubs  And you're like  Oh that's pretty cool  Oh that's how they do it  Flushing like  You know like 55 golf balls  Down a toilet  Yeah  With only a half a gallon of water  I'm fascinated  I love those goddamn shows  Watch them all the time  I don't think I watch any  Any like sitcoms  Fun TV  You don't watch any fun TV  No  It all has to educate me  On stuff that I could  Give a flying fuck about  When are you ever going to  Need to make molasses  No never  But I can watch it 
[00:12:30]  I'll watch them  Put that little bucket  On the side of a tree  Let it drip in  But now  Like what history is doing  Is they're trying to  Bring the two worlds together  And they're having  Like that show Top Shot  Where  Yeah  I thought it was going to be  More just straightforward  Type of show  Where it really is more  Of a survivor  Meets  You know gun fighting  Or something  And it's so  Realityed out  That like  I thought I didn't want  To watch it  But it did end up  Sucking me in  But I was kind of  Like I felt stupid 
[00:13:00]  Watching it  Because it was  A reality show  I fucking  Hate reality shows  I can't watch them  It was on last night  I think  I saw there was  An episode with two  There was like two finalists  They were shooting  At four and six hundred yards  Yeah yeah yeah  That was the elimination  Challenge Jimmy  I had to turn it off  Because I was  She's like  Look this is too much  Of a guy show  I'm like  Oh really  Yeah I'm like  You're right  You're right  So we turned it off  And the bitch  Made me dinner  Yeah even 
[00:13:30]  Even with gunfire  Believe me  I do enjoy  A little gunfire  I just can't take  The reality show  Format  I don't like  Any of the groups  Of people  They put together  For them  They're all  From a casting  Fucking department  It's not  Reality  It's the same  Dumb  This person's  Gotta be eliminated  And then there's a way  To not be eliminated  I could give a shit  And this  And like  What bugs me about this  Because I thought  It was gonna be  All of the competitors  Doing all the competitions 
[00:14:00]  And so like  You know  First episode out  This ex-marine  Sorry  Spoiler alert fellas  The ex-marine is out  There's no such thing  As an ex-marine  But what if he was good  At all the other events  Like I don't give a fuck  If he's on the show  Or not  Yeah  But I wanna see  You know  I wanna see exercises  In marksmanship  See what he's good at  Yeah  I don't give a fuck  Who stays next week  He gets eliminated  I just wanna see  The events happen  Yeah  And then you're like  Ah he might've been  Really good at something  Might've been fun to watch  Just have a shot 
[00:14:30]  A show where  You get good people  That can shoot  And show that  You don't have to  Fucking add the  Stupid reality show thing  And then the  Any of the dating ones  The Bachelor  Or fucking  Coke whore  Whoever you're fucking  The new Flavor  Flavor  Where a bunch of  Fat Projects girls  Fight for the right  To lick his balls  Clean after his shit  Who fucking cares  Terrible  The best part of that show  Is when the one  Shit on the floor  Like a fucking chihuahua

[00:17:00]  Big time  Doug Stanhope  Of course  Would be the loose cannon  He could also be  The unsavory character  He's a currently unsavory character  But he's currently  Yes  And uh  He's at here  I think at 8  And Frank Lucas  Who uh  American gangster  Is based on  Yeah  Will be here at 9 o'clock  And he's 79  But he was you know  He was  Arguably the biggest drug dealer  In the country  For a long time  Or one of them at least  Yeah  Yeah  He's making a million  It was a million dollar a day operation  In 1970 
[00:17:30]  79  Doesn't matter  When you're in that business  No  They could do just as much damage  If you do something  I mean  You watch something like Casino  Ah  Why take the chance  That's  Yeah  He's a good guy  A marine  Nah  Why chance  Yeah  Why chance  And he's dead  He's out of the business though  But he's promoting a book  Which makes me feel better  Yeah  It's not like he's promoting  Fucking packets of Blue Devil  So uh  Frank Lucas is in

[00:26:00]  That did that too  That was kind of cool  That was a while ago  Release a bunch of people  In a junkyard  And they have to find shit  Although I think  They planted some of that  Stuff in there  It was just too convenient  That they'd find shit  That they absolutely needed  In the junkyard  Half the time  Shit didn't work anyway  I was watching it  The other day  It'd fall apart real quick  Yeah and like  All of a sudden  They changed the rules  Because shit's falling apart  I was like  This fucking show  They're like well  We'll give them  20 more minutes  To weld something on  That they weren't allowed  To use  Is that done now  That show  I don't think there's  Any new episodes  I think they just  Rerun it  Oh someone's got

[00:28:30]  In real life  In real life  Yeah  But without real  People just  Targets  Unless of course  You were in  Afghanistan  It's gonna get to  A point where  We're just going  Yeah  Me and Danny  Are going to  Afghanistan  We're just  Yeah no  We're gonna kill  Real people  It's gonna be  Great  There's gonna be  Mercenaries  I don't know  What the hell  Christ on a pony  Yeah  I don't know  Show up there  Wouldn't be any  Kegs  Yeah I know  We'd be bored  Where's the  Sweetberry wine 
[00:29:00]  Where's the  Where's the beers  I don't know  I understand  There's a big party  At Ant's house  This weekend  Oh is there  I don't know  Yeah  I don't know  If you say that  Every week  You're probably  Right half the time  There's usually  Something going on  There  Something  Whether it's a  Big party  Or just kind of  A get together  Of you know  Friends just  Drinking a few  Beers  Or a full  Debauchery  Full debaucherous  Party  I'm up to now 
[00:29:30]  Getting two  Kegs at a clip  Delivered  Because one  Keg  Of the Bud Light  Was not enough  Of course not  So  But it wasn't me  Just drinking it all  I had a lot of  People that were  Coming over  And they  You know  They drink beer  So the beer guy  He comes by  With his hand truck  And rolls down my stairs  Barely speaks English  But he starts  Even looking at me  Like oh boy  What are you doing  You're a drunk  Yeah  A drunk  He knows  He knows  Burracho 
[00:30:00]  Muy burracho  Mucho burracho  Whatever it is  I don't speak  Hispani  But I do drink  And uh  Yeah  More beer  More beer  More gooder  Do you think  Do you think they  Talk about you  Like around the office  Probably  Yeah  Oh he's ordering  Again  Again  Didn't we just  Drop two kegs off  The office at the  Beer distributor  Yeah  Yeah  That's gotta be  A real suit and tie  Jesus Jimmy  My god  Did you see him 
[00:30:30]  What was he thinking  Probably some filthy warehouse  Of course it is  They have no idea  Whose house  The guy's probably  Been to your house  Fucking eight times  He doesn't remember you  Because he's also  A drunkard  Yeah  Of course  My friend used to  Work at a beer distributor  The guy behind the counter  Would sit there  With the scratch off tickets  Like on the roll  And just roll it down  Like toilet paper  And not even scratch them off  Just scan them  To get the winners  And then hopefully  He would win enough  During the day  To pay back the drawer  Can they tell  That you've scanned them though  Isn't it like  If you scan it once  It knows that  That ticket's been scanned 
[00:31:00]  Well yeah  But he would keep using it  He would just hope  He was gambling with himself  Hoping that he would  Outwin what he owed  The drawer  Oh shit  So by scanning them  You have to buy them  Technically yeah  So if he didn't win anything  By the end of the day  And he you know  He owed the drawer 40 bucks  He had to put 40 bucks  He was just  Just keeping from the hassle  Of scratching off  Yeah he just wanted  He was just looking  For that big pay  Beep beep beep  That's all he would do all day  What's the most he won  I don't know  I didn't  There was a friend of mine  That worked there  A couple hundred you think  He probably won  A couple hundred bucks 
[00:31:30]  I'm sure  Yeah that can't work  By the way  I fucking love the post man  There's a  Fuck Reuters  You know it's amazing  Reuters  The Associated Press  There's a picture of the  You know the big  The Israelis boarded that ship  Yes they did  The peace activists  And the photo Reuters sent out  Like a bunch of the Israelis  Blood was cropped out  And so was a knife  Being held  By the  Go to the post page 25  You can see  Why is that?  Why is that?  Because it makes the Israelis  Look really fucking bad  Oh 
[00:32:00]  But when you see  Where the photo was cropped  And the actual photo  They're making it look like  All these people  Are helping him up  I gotcha  With the knife  The guy's holding a knife  And it's cropped out of the photo  So they're showing  The actual picture  And how it was cropped  And how it was sent out  By Reuters  And this is lying with photos  Wow yeah they did  See that isn't  That's a huge  Fucking difference  That's bias reporting  Right there  If you're cropping  Major things out of the picture 
[00:32:30]  That really show the story  Yeah  At least Helen Thomas  Said what she said  But said it  And she's hot  Yeah I mean  Obviously we'd all fuck  Right in the mouth  Oh with that big  Schnozola  On your pubis  No what you do  Is here's how you fuck  Helen Thomas in the mouth  You lay her on her back  And you hang her head  Over the edge of the bed  And her fucking  Her wig falls off  Like Pesci  And JFK  And then you put  Your asshole over her nose 
[00:33:00]  Give her mouth  A good stiff dick  There is  There is nothing better  Than the head  Over the end  Of the bed thing  If they like it  If a girl likes  Having her mouth fucked  The edge of the bed  Hangover rules  If they don't  It's not going to be  A long time  There's other words  When you hang the head over  And they're like  And you're like  All right get up  No no  The hanging the head over  And not so staged  Where it's like  They're laying on the bed  And the head is just  Hanging over like that  I like the head to be  Hanging over a little sideways  And scoop it up 
[00:33:30]  Like a lizard  Graves a mealworm  You know  Just kind of looks at it  Sideways a little  And then  It's right in  Do you know how  You know how fucking  Disgusting I feel  If a girl's head is over  And I'm looking down  As I fuck her mouth  And my stomach is showing  And I'm twiddling my nipples  I'm like  This is  This poor chick  And what sound do you make  When you do a twiddling  Of course you do  But it really is  I feel bad for women sometimes  Yeah  Yeah I've actually  Taken myself out of it  During sexual moments 
[00:34:00]  I've been like  But you don't seem like  And this might sound like  I'm making light  Of James  And his sexual prowess  But you don't  You don't seem like  The guy that enjoys  Degrading women  During a sexual encounter  Maybe I don't seem that way  But boy do I  Do you  Because I'm not really  Into the degradation  Either way  Like I'm more of a 
[00:34:30]  I just like  Any parties involved  To be having fun  And having a good time  And feeling good  And not feeling badly  About what happened afterwards  Here's how I know  I had good sex  When I'm wiping blood  Off my dick  And she's crawling  To the bathroom  Crying  I just want to go home  I'm sorry  A little early  For that joke  6.45  I don't know  We have one  Jesus Jimmy  That would be great 
[00:35:00]  You have to  In a replay  But  Wow  It's probably a little  Early for that one  No  I've never been  Into the degrading  Thing  It just would  Make me feel bad  A little slapping  Or some hair pulling  I don't consider  That degrading  Like the slapping  Kind of a thing  Because it's a playful  Little smack on the ass  And things like that  Never on the face  I've never smacked  A girl on the face  During sex  Really?  No  What else haven't you done?  Haven't you ever 
[00:35:30]  Watched a baseball game?  Taking a deep breath  Of fresh air?  Seen the blue sky?  Yeah  No I just  And the hair pulling  Thing is more of a  To get traction  Like you know  You could  If you're doing  Kind of  A missionary position  Thing  You get your arms up  To the back of her head  Grab onto her hair  And it gives you  A little more  Push room  Which  They seem to like  See I pull the hair  When I'm fucking  Really hard from the back  And my average dick  Is not doing 
[00:36:00]  The intended damage  I'm like  How do we get  A yelp out of this girl  Without going to  Fucking federal prison  For a long time  Yank her hair  Do you give it a yank  Like we're gonna  Hurts her a little bit?  Yeah yeah yeah  Like we're fucking  Like we're robbing a bank  In 1750  And she's my getaway horse  I just don't  I don't  I don't find it  Fun  Even if the girl  Like suggests  Certain things  Like oh could you  You know  I kind of like when  When I get my hair  Pulled really hard 
[00:36:30]  I'm like  I just can't really  Bring myself to do it  It all depends on  Where you put your hand  You have to put your hand  Up by the skull  The skull  By the skull  By the scalp  Just a fucking  Fucking a rotting body  Yeah  Put it by the  The skull that's starting  To show through  The rotting scalp  No I dig  I dig my nails  Into the  Into the scalp  And I hold on like that  See chicks  I fucking use pins  From Rocky Dennis' map  And I grab her head  With the  You said they replayed  The Rocky Dennis  Bashing yesterday  I was

[00:40:30]  Did people talk to her  Yeah they asked her people  And she took photos  As she was leaving  In front of the serious sign  So they asked me  I could just step in  Which was okay  That's fine  That's how to do it like that  She's doing interviews  Whatever  Yeah  And I just twittered  I'm not trying to  Whore my own twitter  Believe me  But the photo  There's just  There's no human chemistry  Between us  Oh really  At all  And she looked weird to me  Like I would have fucked her  But somebody at the post  Really hates her  Yeah  Because they  Have a picture of her  In today's paper 
[00:41:00]  From yesterday  And they nailed it  They said she looks like  Phyllis Diller  And that's exactly  Who she looks like  Wow  She does not look good  That is  Quite an insult  Yeah  Quite the  Quite the difference  Between  What she looked like  And they said  No one  No one  When  When she was doing  That video  On the boxing ring  With half her clothes off  And fucking sweating  And everything  Dirty  Yes  Dirty  Thank you Sam  No one would have thought  She'd ever be called 
[00:41:30]  Phyllis Diller  Wow  But she does look different  Like something happened  To her face  She looks weird man  She looks very  She was very small  In person  And she didn't look  Maybe she's just older  Than we think  Yeah but her face  Got like fat  And her nose  Got fat  Did it  Look at that  Fucking  See this is the video  We're watching it right now  Dirty  And  And she just looks  Really fucking good  In this  Yeah

[00:43:00]  And  It has to be driving her nuts  All these comparisons  To Lady Gaga  Like that's humiliating  To be just being  Smashed  By the new kid in town  She looks fucking  And they say  Christina is Lady  Gag  Gag  No they did not  Yes they did  Oh shit  Oh they didn't  They're calling a Lady  Gag  Gag  Who's older  Is Lady Gaga  Like how old is Lady Gaga  Lady Gaga  I have no idea how old she is  She's young  She's 25  And Christina Aguilera  Dude she looks terrible  With his hair 
[00:43:30]  Is she in her 30s  She'll be 30 in December  She'll be 30  That's all she is  She looks horrendous here  Yeah  That hair is fucking awful  She looks like an old lady  Whoever heard  Posila said she'd be shot  She looks like  Mrs. Brady  In the Wesson Alley commercials  Yes  Yeah that  This is long after  The Brady Bunch  When she was putting  Wesson Oil on her fingers  Yeah  And shoving him in  Mike Lookin' Linshine  When Cousin Oliver  Lost his ring  He went to Aunt Flo  And she fucking  How far am I gonna go 
[00:44:00]  With that  Exactly  Said it already  Yeah they could pull  The ring out of her  Out of his ass  You could just continue  Yeah  Sure  Sure Mr. Brady  Would have volunteered  To go in there  Of course  Fish it out  Or had Tiger do it  With his little claws  Two hands  You really feel around  In there I bet  Oh and Mr. Brady's  Or Oliver  Of course  Mr. Brady's  Put two arms up there  And clap  He'd lose a ring  Oh there's my hula hoop  See cause he was gay  Yeah  And he had a big asshole  From taking lots of dicks  In it  Yes he did 
[00:44:30]  So yeah  She was kind of  You know again  She looked  Really fucking cranky  Yeah  Yeah  Oh maybe she found out  That Lady Gaga's video  Was coming out  The same day or something  As her new album  Came out  And what were you saying  About her album cover  There Samuel  I didn't see any  About her album cover  Oh  Maybe that was  E-Rock  I have so many people  In here  And it's people  That I really  Don't care about  So I just mix them up  Oh that means  I'm teasing of course 
[00:45:00]  No it was the seat  Yeah E-Rock  Was in the seat  What did they say  Her album was too  Like she's just  Getting compared  That's hers  See Christina Aguilera  Has got some kind  Of a weird Lady Gaga  Look she's trying to do  I think  And I think people  Are really calling her  Out on it  I tried to get  First I tried to ask  If I could get  Five minutes with her  Like on a flash record  Five minutes  They said no  That's not even  Going to happen  And then yesterday  I was like  Let me get one question  30 seconds  I was like  I'll just ask her  What color her shoes are 
[00:45:30]  Just the most random  And innocent of questions  Yeah  No way dude  Why  No way  They said she was  Not feeling it  They said she was not  She's got to just  Be in a shitty mood  Yeah  Because of this  Gaga situation  Humiliating  Yeah  And being called  Lady Gag  Gag  Yeah  You don't think  Christina Aguilera  Knows what's being written  In the fucking  New York Post about her  And plus  You don't  If you're on page six  You know it  Yeah  If there's a big photo of you  And they're calling you  Phyllis Diller  And your thing is to be sexy 
[00:46:00]  Someone lets you know  You might not  Whatever  They're just jerks  They're trying to  Yeah  And then they're just  Fawning over Lady Gaga  And talking about her  Success stories  You know how mad she is  Waking up to this this morning  What the fuck  You know how mad she must be  She just cancelled her summer tour  Yeah  Probably  I bet you to have her dance stuff changed  Yeah  Because it was a little too Gaga-ish  You think so?  I mean she probably wasn't  Sound tickets either  Her  Her single is not  Picking up the way she thought it would 
[00:46:30]  What about Lady Gaga's  Is the download  How many people have viewed  Her latest video?  Alejandro came out  Yesterday afternoon  Yeah  And it's at  3.25 million views  Jesus  So she's doing okay  Yeah  I guess she's doing alright  And uh  Lady gag gag  Is not selling records  Yeah  That's why she's pissed  Come on  She's gotta be really livid  But I mean  That doesn't mean that  Sam can't ask her  A fucking question 
[00:47:00]  One question  Come on  Well she's probably sick  Of hearing about the Lady Gaga  She's probably only going to people  She knows are not gonna ask her that  Do you think a lot of people  Are like  So what do you think of Lady Gaga?  Yeah  You guys are kinda similar  People who don't know  How much mad it makes  Oh god  Yeah  Just dummies  Yeah  Oh  You kinda remind me of her  That thing  Yeah  So have you seen  The latest Lady Gaga  Uh video  Excited  It's coming out  Yeah  Very excited  You know why  Because I think  It's the same genre of music  So it has to help you 
[00:47:30]  In some way comment  Put the gun down  I would love to know  What she was saying  In these interviews  Because I hear that she was  Not in a good  Good spirits  Well she's probably got that  Latina thing going  Where she gets a little  You know  Ah  That Latina rage  A little Latina rage in her  Her husband was here too  Really?  Was he?  Yeah  Who's her husband?  They were fighting  Uh he's like a record producer  He's nobody famous  Yeah but he's producer  Okay he's in the business  Yeah he's in the business  Hate when  Hate when hot girls 
[00:48:00]  You know and I will call her hot  I'm not  I'm not calling her Lady Gag Gag  Or Phyllis Diller  At this point  I mean she  Has looked better  But  Believe me if she didn't  Take a photo with me  I would be much  Unkinder  Yes  Right now  But since she did  And she was like  Okay hi  You know she wasn't  Terrible  She was fine  Yeah  But it's  I don't like when  They go with people  In their own industry  I don't know why  That bothers me  Cause I  Like I have a shot  I just  I like when 
[00:48:30]  When hot girls  Just take  Random guys  And decide just  Yeah because then you think  You know it wasn't me  But it could have been  And if God forbid  Something happens  Between the two of them  Still got a shot  Yeah I think so  Yeah I don't  But you know  Well what are you gonna do  You can't show your house  To Christina Aguilera  Cause you have a great house  But so does she  She probably has a bigger one  I'm sure she does  She's probably got a  A bigger house  Of course  But you know  Mine is  Mine is fun 
[00:49:00]  And comfortable  And I wouldn't call her  Lady gag gag  Unless she gagged  On my hog  Yeah  Are you gagging  What did you call me  Here's the key  Trying to be nice  For you and I  To get hot shakes  Let's be honest  Yeah  We need them to start  In abject poverty  Yeah  I need a girl  On food stamps  Abject poverty  Complete lack  Of self esteem  Yeah  Yeah we can't have  Any self esteem  Daddy issues  Are always a help  You know I like to hear  When I'm still in bed 
[00:49:30]  And I hear a girl  In the bathroom  I like to hear tears  And boo  When she's in front  Of the mirror  That's what I need  She really doesn't  Appreciate her own self worth  Tremendous self loathing  The worse your self esteem is  The better you're gonna feel  With me  The easier it is  And then maybe  If you ever go out  To dinner  On like a dinner date  You like when  You know  That they've never  Been to a place  Better than the red lobster  Yeah  And you take them 
[00:50:00]  To a nice restaurant  And all of a sudden  You're you know  King shit  King shit  Yeah  That's what I need  When the money  When throwing around  The money doesn't help  Yeah  I'm fucking  My goose is cooked  I have very little  To offer ladies  We suck  We really do have nothing  Maybe uh  You know  What am I gonna offer you  Nothing  Nothing  Sorry  Sorry about that  Constantly apologizing  Sorry  Sorry  I'm sorry  I'm sorry I'm me  You know what  There's the whole dinner  All the stuff is just a show

I know it is  Yeah  Because you're talking all the time  And by the time they get over there  You've already seen their clit  And you've showed photos of your dick  The internet changed the entire dating game  Yeah it seems like  The courting  And the foreplay  Is done online  With photos 
[00:51:30]  And  Hello  Hello  Answering phone calls loudly  As he walks out of the studio  Yeah all that stuff  Is done  Beforehand  Online  So that when you finally meet  You've already said  Filthy things to each other  Yep  You've shown each other  Certain parts of your body  And  Yeah  Let's just get right down to fucking  That's interesting  Because you lose a lot of  What goes in the dating process  I noticed that my last girlfriends  Like girls I've actually dated  Yeah 
[00:52:00]  Are all girls I've met  In person  None of them are girls  I've met online  Like I've  I've gone out with girls  I've met online  But the girls I've actually  Become girlfriend and boyfriend with  Are all women I've met  In person  And had to go through  Some kind of normal  Get to know process  Really  Yeah  Before  Even though it might not have been  Traditional  It was still face to face  It was not  So you have to work through  All that beginning shit  Or at least some of it  Before it becomes physical  Instead of just 
[00:52:30]  Here we are face to face  Hi  And five minutes later  You're in bed  Yeah  It's really  One  I'm going over my last girlfriends  All of them I've met face to face  And I've communicated with  A lot of women online  But for some reason  That doesn't turn into  A relationship for me  Yeah  I guess my long termers  Have been  Face to face  That's because  There wasn't  Like the last time  When you saw  David Melinda  The Facebook didn't exist  Right  And your wife  No  It was barely any  Oh Bob 
[00:53:00]  The wife  Please  She'd never have done that  I wish there was the internet  Could have looked that up  And gone  No  Stay away  Get reviews on her  No  One star  Stay away from this one boys  It'll cost ye  Yeah  That's  But now  You see everything  You kind of  The filthy talking  Is  Is really odd 
[00:53:30]  Because if you're face to face  With somebody  Just hanging out  In a bar  Or wherever you meet people  I just say bar  Because I don't go anywhere  Right  In church  You wouldn't just  Blurt shit out like that  But you have this way  Of putting an LOL  Or a  Heedly heedly  At the end  Of something  LMAO  Or whatever it is  Yeah  That's extremely sexual  You could test the waters  Without that fear  Of the slap in the face  Rejection  You know  So it 
[00:54:00]  And if you get something back  That's equally as filthy  You know  You can get even dirtier  And her disapproving silence  Is just  Your phone  Not vibrating new text  Right  You don't have to be  Face to face  And deal with that  Awkwardness  Of saying the wrong thing  Yeah  And then so  Uh  Uh  Yeah  So what  Where do you  Where do you work  What um  What do you do  Uh  After that  Horrible  Look of disapproval 
[00:54:30]  Because you said  Can I lick your asshole  Yeah  Or instead of showing a picture  Of your cock  You just pull it out  And hold it  Yeah  Hold it  With a picture frame around it  Yeah  Here you go  And shine the light on it  Right  Can you hold a flashlight  On my cock  Make it look bigger  Look at it from way up  But it really has changed  The way you fucking do business  With chicks man  It's like  Yeah  You get so jaded so quickly  Cause my friend's  Uh  Sister is  Is dating  She was  With someone a long time  And now she's telling me  She's dating online  And she's like  You just go through people 
[00:55:00]  And none of them go anywhere  Yeah  None of them go anywhere  But then again  You hear about all these people  That meet on J-Date  And get fucking married  So what do I know  Is J-Date like a dating service  For Jewish dates  Or what's the other one  E-Harmony  Whatever the fuck they are  Oy vey  Yeah those seem  Yeah match.com right  Now those to me  Seem more like people  That want long term relationships  They've looked around  They don't like the  The bar scene  Or the fucking church  Or movies  Or going out  To wherever the fuck  You meet live people  Uh  And then they meet them 
[00:55:30]  For relationships  That's what it seems like  To me  It doesn't seem like  It's fucking  Craigslist  Or  Yeah Anthony's looking  For adult friend finder  I think  Yeah adult friend finder  Yeah those are all  Genuine ads  Really  Dude I had a profile  Years ago  I got no responses  Oh no  None  You put your  You put your name in there  I had a great photo  Of my cock  When it still had hair on it  That's how long  I was doing that  I remember  You know I finally  Shaved my pubes  Where I sent out a photo  Of my dick  When I used to have hair on  I took a photo in LA 
[00:56:00]  Years and years ago  And I sent it to somebody  And she just sent back  You should shave that  Oh  Did she mean your dick itself  To shave that off  Yeah shave the skin off  Yeah  She like cock  Still looked like  They were just burned  Freshly in a fire  Oh  Yeah it's  It's a whole  A whole nother way of  Um  I wonder how that'll affect  The future  I just wonder what the  Effect will be  Of things like that  That there isn't  Really this  Especially for the  One night stand thing 
[00:56:30]  There still isn't  That interaction  That you need  To uh  Kind of close the deal  You could do it  Online  And hope for the best  And like you said  If your phone  Doesn't ring back  Oh well  Right  Cause you got three other  That you're having  The same conversation with  Or three other  That you're having  The same profile exchanges with  So you don't have  As much invested  In one person at all  Yeah  Right after  I got out of my  My long term relationship  And decided  I wasn't gonna do it again  And I was just gonna 
[00:57:00]  Date girls  Poorly  Cause I was very bad  At my juggling acts  Back then  Oh god  Was I the worst  Keith and uh  Ange would just  Make fun of me  What are you doing  Like don't you  You can't invite  The same people over  Different people over  At the same time  Like yeah  Come on over  Yeah come on over  Yeah come on over  And then you know  They're all saying  Hi to each other  Doesn't work that way  Why don't we all  Go to bed  No  Where are you going  Wouldn't you feel awkward 
[00:57:30]  Uh  That only happened once  And she was in a closet  Yes I do remember that  That was  Oopsie  That was an Anthony oopsie  At his best  I was a guest that night  And I saw problems brewing  I'm like that ain't gonna  This is not gonna work out well  I was uh  Really  Trying  A little too hard  To juggle  Uh things back then  Cause I was  I was a whole  It was a whole new  Experience for me  I was in  Little relationships  That lasted for years  And then I was not  And and I went  A little crazy 
[00:58:00]  For a while there  You weren't just juggling  You were walking around  With a fucking robe  And a pina colada  In one hand  Just Richard Dawson  Pecking everybody on the lips  Hello darling  Get to know each other  It was terrible  It was great  It was great  You were just being all  Suave and debonair  And then the M80  Went off in your face  Oh  It's like this isn't gonna work  And everyone knew it  Everyone's just walking up to me  Going  Dude she's getting a little upset  With you  In the hot tub  With that one  And that  I'm like what  Give me another drink 
[00:58:30]  I can give a shit  Fucker  What  It's my hot tub  Yeah  It's my house  My party  Fuck  Fuck  Don't get nervous  We're in my party  Yeah but I was  I wasn't  Very good at it  I would be  I would  I would just like  Write things in text  And then  Copy  And paste it on another text  Copy paste  How great is that  Copy paste  I just figured it was like  Using the same bait  On multiple hooks  You know 
[00:59:00]  Hey come on  When I  Just throw a few hooks  In the water  With the same fucking  Shrimp at the end of it  It was just  It was basically just a photo  Of your mortgage papers  Want to come suck a dick  In this mansion  A bank statement  Yeah  Here it is  I find I have no pride  I'm very comfortable  Doing the same thing  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Cares  I  I kinda  I kinda do like that  Real interaction thing  Yeah  Cause it kinda  Sets you apart from 
[00:59:30]  The everybody  That's doing  The text  And sexting  And shit like that  Cause you gotta be  A little more on your game  In real life  You can't just  Fucking text  Filthy things  And you know  Hope it works  You gotta have a personality  You gotta kinda be funny  Or charming  Or whatever the fuck  You gotta be  But uh  Being online  Just completely  Wipes that out  Cause the second  The second  You get anything  Sexual back  It just turns into 
[01:00:00]  Debauchery  And the worst is  When the girl is trying  To get back into  Real conversation  And you're thinking  Like what are you  Doing  Well I just say that  We were just talking  About fucking  You know  Tagging you from behind  Or something  Yeah who cares  What I'm in Tampa  The fuck you asking me for  I don't wanna hear  About your day  Or  Don't change subjects  Yeah  No one's interested  But they do that  Cause I think women  Will sense it  Going out of control  Like oh boy  That's all this is gonna be  Yeah but  The worst is like 
[01:00:30]  Once you've thrown out  The sexual stuff  And gotten it back  The next time you talk  How they kinda wanna  Start from point A again  And you're like  We're already on  Yeah we're already there  There's no need to go back  Yeah  Wow what an odd thing  It makes it very hard man  Online shit makes it  Really hard to have  A connection  Cause you get rid of people  So quickly  You really get rid of people  Immediately  And if  If you just  Did have some kind of  Sexual conversation  And you do meet  You can absolutely be 
[01:01:00]  With somebody  That you have  Nothing in common with  Nothing to talk about  No common interest  Except for your  You know  Sexual babble  Over a text  And then what do you do?  Unless you're just  Gonna have sex  And then leave  You're left in a  Very awkward situation  Of not knowing  What to say to each other  You can have good sex  Off  Like a lot of times  You'll get good  Good sex off the computer  Because you've talked enough  And felt each other out enough 
[01:01:30]  Where you've kind of  You kind of weed out  All non-hackers  Who do not pack the gear  To serve in my beloved core  You fucking go through  So you narrow it down  To good fuck partners  But you're right  Then you got nothing  To say to each other  Well some people say  I'm reading here  That's the point  It's all about fucking  Yeah  But  But if you're looking for  A little more than fucking  But not a relationship  Like if you  Unless you're fucking 
[01:02:00]  And then the door's opening  And they're leaving  There's gotta be some kind of  Conversation going on  And if it's uncomfortable  Or dull  Or something  Then you're just left in some  Weird situation  Yeah it's  And again  Even if you're just  Looking for  For fucking  What's worse than  When you have somebody  Come for like  One or two nights  From somewhere else  Just to fuck  But then you forget  That after you come  You're gonna have  Nothing to talk about 
[01:02:30]  And then they're there  For another 21 hours  Or another 45 hours  You've been in that situation  Fucking  Yes  Yes  Dude I'm so impatient  I can't even  The next warning  Can't come fast enough  Yeah  I'm really fucking terrible  I'm everything  They fucking warn you about  I'm a complete piece of shit  Is there cuddling  Is there attempted cuddling  On part of the  The girl  Jimmy's face  Is classic right now  He just smelt shit  That's Jimmy's face 
[01:03:00]  They literally have  A better shot  At finding  Fucking  Khartoum's head  In their bed  Than they do  Of cuddling with me  After the load  Is fucking dispensed  No cuddling  No  Unless I like you  Or unless I know you  Well enough to cuddle  Cuddling feels creepy  If you don't know  Somebody at all  What am I doing  You like to cuddle  When you don't like  No I'm trying to think  Of what you just said  That is an odd thing  If you absolutely  Don't know the person  If you've had even  Some light conversation 
[01:03:30]  And get along  A little bit  The old  Post copulation  Head on the shoulder  While the TV is on  Ain't bad  That's alright  As long as  You know  Ten minutes later  The hand's back  On my dick  Exactly  As long as  Only a precursor  To fucking licking  From my nipple  Down to my fucking  Balls  Which now have  Cake batter on them  Thanks to you  Your fucking  Horrible yeast infection  Cake batter  Ugh  Yeah it looks like 
[01:04:00]  A couple of the  Beaters that need  To be licked  Yeah it's kind of  Icky  No you don't want  That sour smell  On your dick  That is something  Though  Never thought about that  There  Okay see  See now that's  The kind of call  I want  Mike  Mike  Let's talk to  Mike  What up boys  James  Happy birthday  Good sir  Hi Mike  I had three  Separate girls  I kept doing it  To myself  That I met online  And I would get  Them to come out  To my house  One lived in like 
[01:04:30]  California  Another one in Boston  And you're so right  The second you blow  Your load  It's like  Oh god  When are you  Going home  Ugh  But what are the  Girls looking for  Like what are they  Looking for  In that  You've sexted  With each other  Now obviously  As guys  We're all talking  About yeah  You come in  You have sex  You don't really  Have much in common  To talk about  Or anything  What was the girl  Hoping to gain  From the dirty  Talking and knowing  That where this  Is gonna go 
[01:05:00]  Sometimes just that  And other times  I think they're  Using it as a  Springboard  Into a closer  Connection  And they think  That if they give  You that  You'll give them  What they want  Are there just  Girls that are  Into just the  Fucking part  And they leave  And yeah  Wow  I think Jimmy  Nailed it with that  You know  Trying to take that  And then maybe  That's gonna propel  Into something  That's gonna be  A lot more meaningful  But then it  It just doesn't  You know  It didn't happen  It was awful  The most uncomfortable  Feeling in my tummy  Ever  How much time  Did you have with her  Uh the one girl 
[01:05:30]  She came out  From San Jose  California  And she was hot  As balls  But like  She came in on a Friday  And wasn't leaving  Until like Sunday night  It was just the worst  Jimmy's  How long  Like what did you do  Did you fuck her  The minute she walked  To the door  Or what did you do first  Well what happened  Is I took her  I picked her up  At the airport  And then we went  To dinner  And I was still like  Trying to force myself  Into being like  No no no  I think I could like  This broad  And then like  I got home  We got back to my place  And she was like 
[01:06:00]  I don't want to do  Anything right away  Because I don't want you  To think that I'm like  You know  A loose girl  Or anything  And then like  18 minutes later  I'd already blown my load  All over  So that was over  18 minutes  After she said  She doesn't want  To do anything fast  So it was just  And then it was literally  Like once you're done  You're like  Okay so  What do you want to do  And then you're like  I don't know  Go to sleep  Not talk to you  That's brutal  Yeah it really  It is extremely  Fucking awkward  The hang afterwards 
[01:06:30]  It just  It can't end  Fucking quickly enough  Soon enough  Yeah because  I remember when I was  I'm sorry but  When I was working  In Vegas with Dice  Years ago  This is when I still  Live at Florentine  In Jersey  And our house  Was awful  You guys saw it  On the old cribs  We did back in 2000  Terrible  And she was obviously  So disappointed  When she got to my place  Because she met me  At the Venetian hotel  Opening for Dice  Yeah  She probably thought  I had something going on  Yeah you had  You had something big  You were going  Going to big places 
[01:07:00]  I knew  I knew it was going to be bad  When we were joking around  Before she came  She's like  What do you drive  Do you have a car  I'm like  I got a Mercedes  And a Rolls  And she wrote back  Oh really  Like happy  And I was like  No I got  A Saturn  But she was happy  But Mercedes  And Rolls  Was what she  Was hoping for  Then she got to my place  And she was so bummed  And she was like  Maybe 3 in the afternoon  We got into my apartment  And she just looked around  And she's like  Do you go to eat alcohol 
[01:07:30]  Oh she needed drinks  So I got her vodka  In the middle of the afternoon  And she was asking me  To teach her chess  At 3 in the afternoon  It was really horrendous  The worst thing  That I found  Is like  Even too  Even if like  You kind of like  Abroad  Back then  This was like  7, 8 years ago  Like what are you going to do  Like we're going to  Still talk to each other  Every night  You live across  The fucking country  Like what's the best  Case scenario here  So there was like  No  There was no good outcome  So  It's one of those things  That when you need to  Blow a load though 
[01:08:00]  You're thinking crazy  And you don't give a shit  About that  Uncomfortable  Awkwardness  That's sure to ensue  And then I  Repeated my mistake  A couple times  Well what did you find  What did you do  Just hang with the chick  For the weekend  And send her home  That's all I did  And then I never called her again  And then like  I got every email  Call  Text  I thought you were a nice guy  I thought you really liked me  Wow  And I did  I felt awful  I was like  I do  But it's just so uncomfortable  To talk to you now  Because I don't want anything  From you anymore  So  Yeah  Wow  You have a way with words sir 
[01:08:30]  I do indeed  All right  Take care  Sometimes men and women  Want different things  And women are disappointed  And it doesn't go  All right  I understand that  But when women play  This victim shit  Like  Like they've given you  The holy grail  By throwing their legs open  It's like  Look  That's why I don't fuck virgins  Because I don't want that  From you  I don't need that  Like  I would never fuck a virgin  I've turned virgins down  Wow  I've been offered  I've always turned them down  Give that to somebody you like  Send them over to me 
[01:09:00]  Really you like virgins  Oh they do nothing for me  I don't like sexual innocence  I'm teasing of course  How old are virgins these days  Well yeah  Nowadays  Nine  Damn president  It's really  It starts with a commercial  Yes of course  But there's nothing worse  Than after you fuck somebody  And they just won't  They  It's like  Get the fuck out of here  Beat it  Yeah  Scram  What do you want from me  Scramski  Yeah like  After a certain point  It's like  I don't get attached like that  I'm not gonna grovel 
[01:09:30]  And fuck it  But I fucked you  Ugh  I was kind of that guy  For a few years  Where it was  Yeah if I had sex  With a girl  I really kind of got  Attached  Yeah  Yeah  I'm squinting  I know  Jimmy's squinting now  I'm uncomfortable  And he's making an Edward G. Robinson mouth  Mwah  It's uh 
[01:10:00]  But I was like  I would  I would obsess  About the girl  And um  I would  I would  Do anything  I could  To spend time with her  To make sure  She wasn't with anyone else  Oh that's the worst  Yeah yeah  You were the clingy one  I would sacrifice  Anything  I was the guy  That his friends  Would be like  Dude  The second you get a girl  You just disappear  We don't see you anymore  You don't hang out  Cause I need  To spend every second  Knowing where she was  So 
[01:10:30]  I'd know she wasn't  Like  With somebody else  Or  You know  Meeting somebody  That might get  Into a relationship with her  Yeah  Oh I was  I was awful  You were like a cloud  Of neediness  I was so  Needy  Ah  Needy  So you were just  Were there times  Where you hung out with her  Where you could kind of sense  That she really  Like in hindsight  You're like  She probably didn't want  To really hang that much  Yeah  Yeah  There were  There was  There were those times  And I would just  Ugh 
[01:11:00]  And then  You wouldn't take the hint  No I wouldn't  I wouldn't take the hint  I  And I also  Like if they  Did  Go out with another guy  I would lose  My fucking mind  I would lose  My fucking mind  Like  Like just be  An emotional  Disaster area  Just a wreck  I was so needy  But wait  You  So you would hang out  With a girl a little bit  And expect more  But she wanted to see  Other people still  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  It was  And I thought 
[01:11:30]  If I had sex  With a girl  We both  Were not seeing  Other people  Ew  Didn't matter  Like  Didn't matter  What  If it was lust  If it was that  We knew each other  For a while  And were friends  And then that happened  And stuff  To me  That sealed the deal  On  We are now  In a monogamous  Relationship  And it's gonna last  Forever and ever  And I'm in love  And you should be too  So what would you do  When they like  How could you tell  That they didn't 
[01:12:00]  Like when you look back  How could you see  That they  They probably wanted  A little bit of space  But you were just there  When they would  Fuck my friends  Much to my chagrin  It was  It was really bad  I was  And I was just  A fucking  Emotional wreck  Like it was that  Feeling of  Of death  Inside you  Like heartbreak  Yeah  Fucking heartbreak  Was  That's what I was 
[01:12:30]  All about  And I  I had  A need  To be with somebody  Yeah  Like I couldn't be alone  And this was  Just recently  Within the past  Couple of years  Taken care of  Like I could not  Go home  And be in an empty  House  By myself  I needed somebody  There  I could not go to bed  Without someone  Being in bed  Without my  Girlfriend being in bed  And whether we  Were having sex or not  I just needed  Somebody to be  She could be on the  Other side of the  Fucking bed  Back turned to me 
[01:13:00]  Fucking asleep  I just needed  Somebody in there  With me  And now it's like  I fucking like  Being alone  There are times  I just fucking  Love being alone  I'm home  I'm not doing anything  I don't have to do anything  I got my iPad  I got the TVs on  Boom  I go in the pool  I fucking  Solo drunk  Karaoke  Downstairs  Hoping Keith  Doesn't walk in  And videotape me  Without me knowing  How ugly is that  The image that  I'm on that  Little stage  Blasting out 
[01:13:30]  Singing like a  Rock star  To nobody  That's fucking  You're worse than  Rupert Pumpkin  Cause you have an  Audience every day  And then you go home  And you sing to  Chairs  What a psychopath  It really is  You really are  I'm there in shorts  With like my socks on  And just blasting  Into a microphone  With a gun on my hip  And a beer on the bar  I'm just like 
[01:14:00]  What the fuck  There have been times  I've just laughed at myself  There's a difference  Between being comfortable  Being alone  And just being an asshole  Switch Caroline  Good times  Never seem so good  Fucking pistol on my hip  In my shorts  Singing to an empty couch  How horrible  It's so lonely  It's fun  You know sometimes  But I can deal with that now  Like you said  That's so lonely 
[01:14:30]  It was  Right  Like a couple of years back  That would have probably  Brought me to tears  Like look at me  I'm a mess  It's pathetic  I'm alone  Now though  I'm like  I'll do what the fuck I want  I don't care  I'll do this  I'll fucking go  And watch a movie  I'll just hang out  I'll sit out in the yard  Pop my feet up on a chair  And just look at the pool  I don't fucking  I don't feel like  I have to be  In someone else's company anymore  Sometimes it's nice  To have your own space  Like when you  Cause again 
[01:15:00]  I lived in homes  When I was 30  Which really is horrendous  Wow  But it's like  I really always had people around  And I moved in with Jim  And for three years  So it's like  You know  I've been living by myself  For like eight years  I'm 41  It's depressing  It's kind of embarrassing  I like my  Like even if my girlfriend  Is in the next room  I sometimes like my own space  Like you like your own  Fucking energy in the house  Like it's just me  And I can kind of  Hold in a shit  For a little while  If I want  Like if I want to walk around  And then just like  Walk and all of a sudden  I just go  While I'm standing there 
[01:15:30]  And I don't  I can shit  When I  I just  I like be alone  Be alone  Yeah  Alone time  I always had overlapping  Girlfriends too  Where it was overlapping  Not even girlfriends  Overlapping relationships  Where one would end  The second one would start  Yeah  So I would be  In relationships  And  They were living  Fucking relationships  Like they would just  Two seconds  I'm living with someone again  Which usually means  That one started  As the other was ending  Oh yeah  It was one of those deals 
[01:16:00]  You could tell  The other one was  It was old  It was getting  Tiresome  We weren't getting along  Things like that  And out of that  I'd kind of  You know  Notice  There was something else  Out there  And  And  I wasn't  I didn't spend  Any time alone  Until  Probably  A little over  Two years ago  And that's no shit  I mean  From  Mommy  In the house  To moving out  In my 
[01:16:30]  Twenties  I guess  And constantly  Having  A  A  Co-Habitator  Somebody  That I was  Living with  And  It just  Made me  Really  Uncomfortable  To be alone  For so  For a long time  And then  I'm finally  Really comfortable  With it  It's fucking nice  Sometimes man  Just to  I don't know  What it is about  Even if the person's  In the next room  There's something nice  About not having  Another person  Breathe your fucking  Oxygen  Once in a while  Breathe your air  For real  You know what I mean 
[01:17:00]  It's just like  I know I can walk in  And watch what I want  To watch  It's like  I don't want  I don't want  The disapproving  Face  I just want  To be by myself  Or the talking  Sometimes  It's like  You know what  And  Not that it's like  You know  Oh my god  My job  I talk all day long  I don't need to talk  And I like to talk  Believe me  But there are days  Where I get home  And just  I really have  Nothing to say  And I really don't  Want to carry on  A conversation  Or anything  I just want to sit  And watch TV  And veg 
[01:17:30]  Do nothing  And then  I always feel like  If I'm not  Entertaining the person  That  They're gonna get bored  Or there's gonna be  A problem  Right  Or something  You know  So you gotta fucking  Keep the plates spinning  When all you wanna do  Is nothing  Absolutely nothing  Instead of realizing  Tough shit  If she's bored  Yeah  You're bored  I wanna do something  Bye  Do you wanna do something  That was  That was a nightmare  To me  To hear  I wanna do something  Or what do you wanna do  Or can we 
[01:18:00]  Go out  Or do you wanna do this  Or that  And it's like  What do you wanna do  For dinner even  And I'm like  I don't know  You know  Could you have  A thought  Or something  Could you come up  With something  Why is it always  I don't know  Don't talk to me  Don't  But I wouldn't say that  Be like  Okay  Let me panic  And quickly think of something  So you don't get bored  God  God I suck  No I have the same thing  The fear of being  I told one girl I dated  I said I always feel like 
[01:18:30]  I'm auditioning for you  That's a good one  Yeah  I always feel like  I'm auditioning for you  Like I was afraid  Of her getting bored  Yeah  You feel like  If they're not kept  In a constant state  Of entertainment  That they're just gonna  Wander off  What shit self esteem  Yeah  What shitty  Fucking self esteem  Last night I was watching  There was a special  On John Cazale  Which was Fredo  From The Godfather  He was only in five movies  And everyone was nominated  For an Oscar  Yeah  Great  And nobody knows his name  They were walking around 
[01:19:00]  Pictures of Fredo  Fredo  Nobody knew his name  Who's that  Fredo  Yeah  And we're watching  It's a 40 minute documentary  I think it's called  I Knew It Was You  It's on HBO On Demand  It's really fucking great  And they get De Niro  For this  He's interviewed  Pacino in his wig  Yeah  His wig is so bad  But they get guys  That never do interviews  Meryl Streep  And they all talk about Cazale  Coppola  You know  And I'm watching this  And my girlfriend's  Doing something  And then she sits with me  And she's got her  Kind of head on my shoulder  And they're talking about 
[01:19:30]  When Cazale  He died of cancer  He only did five  Fucking movies  All were amazing  And when he found out  He had cancer  And they're just  Getting into that  And it's really emotional  I'm not sad  I'm like wow  This is heavy  And she's just like  You smell really good  And I'm like  Shut up  What are you doing  Was that a prelude  Was she  Was she trying to get  A little amorous with you  No  Oh  She was just  Again  It was like 
[01:20:00]  Oh it's like  You're not getting the same  You're not getting that  Out of this  She was just walking around  Not knowing  It's like  I'm watching this  Yeah  I know I smell good  I bought the cologne  So what  This is important to me  Right now  Oh god bless Al  It's called  I knew it was you  Rediscovering John Cazale  So it's really a great  Fucking  God bless Al Pacino  He just looks weird  At this point  Yeah  Look at me  But uh  You know  Something like that  You want to enjoy it  And just kind of  I should have watched that  By myself  Yeah 
[01:20:30]  Because she's doing  Something with a suitcase  Where she's zipping it  I'm like  I don't want to hear that  I'm watching something  I want to hear  This  And only this  But I know  If I say that  It's going to be  A fucking argument  Yeah  And why  Why should it be  An argument  It shouldn't  You should have  A little bit of freedom  I think that's the thing  A lot of people  Get in  In problems  In relationships over  Is like  Just the freedom  To  Not  Not go out  And fuck people  Right 
[01:21:00]  But just the freedom  To just  Not fucking do anything  And not feel compelled  To do something  I think a lot of it  Has to do with honesty too  Like if you just  If it was okay  I mean it's not a lot of girls  That you could do this with  But if you were to just  To say  Hey  I'm trying to watch something  And you zip in every two seconds  Is it really bothering me  And have her be cool with it  That would be a whole nother story  Yeah  Where is that happening  But unfortunately  That doesn't really happen too often  Where the fuck is that happening  Do you know what I do with my girlfriend  When she's talking too much  I'll just put my hand over her mouth  Oh no  But she actually laughs 
[01:21:30]  Like she's like  Am I talking too much  I'm like non-stop  Oh fuck  That's funny  Endless  But it's not an anger thing  You know  Sometimes you just gotta cover  Somebody's mouth  And just go  Stop  You're talking a lot  You want to stop talking  That is nasty  But I don't do it  When we're mad at each other  It's just like  If we're watching something  And she's just babbling  Do you ever go  Shh  Yes of course  You shush her  Do you have no idea  Shut up  All the time  Shut up  It's not even nasty  I'm being playful  But I'm like  I really am  But yeah  I'm being playful 
[01:22:00]  But I'm serious  Shut up  How could you not want to see  And I forget  That a girl  Is not gonna want to watch  A documentary  On John Cazale  And his big beluga whale  And his big beluga whale forehead  Oh  That giant tumor in there  They were  Dude they were talking about him  They had like  Buscemi interview  They had  Philip Seymour Hoffman interview  Again guys you just  Never see interviewed  And they were talking about  How amazing he was  And they were saying  How great it was  The skip  When he walks 
[01:22:30]  Into the  Oh it's brilliant  How great  Yeah when Michael's  Coming into Vegas  And he's gonna show him  A good time  And he was all happy  That he could do it  And then he just  Blew it again  He pulled Afredo again  And they said  When Michael says to him  Afredo get rid of him  I'm tired  The disappointment  Look  Like they just go to  Cazale for a minute  And he's hurt  Yeah yeah  And wounded  And disappointed  And it's just  It's all this emotion  On his face  And I'm just thinking 
[01:23:00]  Of my own piece of shit  Acting  And all I would've done  Is basically put my hands  On my hips  And gone  Hmm  And crinkled my  I was watching him  Have emotions  Wow  His forehead was not crinkled  I always crinkle my forehead  Because I'm doing that  Face acting  It couldn't crinkle  It was stretched out  From a tumor  He wanted to crinkle it  Horrible  That's  That's terrible  It was  Yeah it's 
[01:23:30]  One of those things  Where you're getting  Into something  And it's serious  And you just  Want to enjoy that moment  I dated a girl years ago  And this is when I knew  The relationship was done  She'd never seen  The Godfather  And we were watching  That's when you knew  It was done  Yeah  It's done  Come on  You're an idiot  I can't fuck anyone  Doesn't know who  Jack Waltz is  We're watching  The Godfather  And we're at the end  Of the movie  And  Michael and Kay  Have that scene  And he's saying  Enough  And he hits the thing  She goes 
[01:24:00]  Michael is it true  She's asking if it's true  That Talia Shire  Was just coming in  And said  Your husband  Had all these people  Murdered  And he's about to answer her  And  Dummy  Asks me a question  Do you understand  This is  The turning  The pinnacle  Of the movie  She just asked him  If it's true  Is he gonna lie  Is he gonna tell the truth  Yeah  And he says  No  What do you want  About  It's like  Oh you fucking  Idiot 
[01:24:30]  Or how about  When you're watching  Something  And then  Your chick goes  What did he just say  And then in the time  That you have to explain  What he just said  And why he said it  Then you miss something  You miss a huge plot point  Or something  And now you have to go back  And see what happened  What's worse  When you're watching something  And you want someone  To hear the next line  Because you know  It's a good one  And they start talking  And then you just  You can't go shut up  So you're like  Uh huh uh huh  Do you just want them  To shut up before the line  Or the moment happens  Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah yeah  You can't shush him  Yeah that's  Ugh  That's the nice part 
[01:25:00]  About being alone  Watch  I was just gonna say  Watching movies  With people is stressful  There's a stress  Especially if you've seen  The movie and they haven't  And you wanna  You know a lot of times  You might wanna turn  Somebody onto a movie  So you've seen the movie  They haven't  And they just don't know  How to watch a fucking movie  With the zest  That you would  Well you know  They're not enjoying it  Because they get up  To go to the bathroom  And they don't ask you  To pause it  Yeah yeah  And I'll even go like  Oh you want me to pause it  No that's okay  And then I pause it anyway 
[01:25:30]  No you're watching this  Yeah I know  You're fucking watching it  And I'm rewinding it  A half hour  You're gonna watch  A half hour of it again  We're rewatching  The fucking wedding scene  For the deer hunter  Whether you like it or not  You shallow fucking whore  Holy shit  Wow  Amazing  The phones are actually lit  Lit  With people that  Love John Gazelle  That love John Gazelle  Maybe  Oh jeez

[01:40:30]  At home yeah yeah  I'm pretty regular  When you're at home  Yeah yeah  Offsets the road  You get kind of jaded being in New York  Or even in the surrounding areas of New York  Because you have  Like the biggest city in the world  Right at your fingertips  So you think  Bisbee Arizona  What the fuck am I going to do with myself?  Yeah  I walk the dogs  We do mushrooms occasionally  Yeah  Baseball games  I would assume drugs play an integral part of being able to deal with  Not being in a major city 
[01:41:00]  No actually  That's where the  The drugs only happen on the road  Really?  Yeah  I don't  Yeah  You know mushrooms in Arizona seem like a cliche  But  Yeah  It's like you gotta do it  Yeah well you wouldn't start doing like lines of blow  Yeah  Town of 6,000 people  I'm in bed by 9, 30, 10 o'clock most of the time  Oh you really live like a real suburban life out there  Yeah yeah  But I'm you know  When I'm off the road  I usually assume  It's a good balance  Yeah I assumed you were kind of just 
[01:41:30]  Out of your mind all the time  No no no  Either doing dope or fucking  Robbing or raping or something  It just comes across that way  When you're on stage  No no  I'm up at 5, 30 in the morning  You're a farmer  Oh really?

[01:42:30]  Sounds like  Even though the clock says 11.30am  Sure  To me it's like 5 in the afternoon  Excellent  Rationalization  Yes  I knew Jim would agree with me  Wholeheartedly  So uh  Are you drinking early at home or no?

[01:44:00]  A week  I didn't meet her  A couple years ago  I met her  I banged her after a show  And then she went right  Into the hospital  She went into the nervous hospital  That put me all  Nervous hospital  No it's not  Yeah  Nervous hospital  Mmm  Doug Stano  I fucked him  This is a true story  I had to go to the nervous hospital  It's a true story  When she was locked up  Because I  I hooked up with her 
[01:44:30]  After a show  And it was years  Before we got together  But when she was  In the mental hospital  As  I was on the man show  They were running  A commercial for the man show  In the  On the TV  In the mental hospital  And she kept trying  To tell people  That she knew me  And she slept with me  And everyone's thinking  Sure you did  Wouldn't she pick somebody else  Yeah exactly  Like you know  Rogan  If you're gonna lie  Yeah right  That animal 
[01:45:00]  So  Alright  So you  You hooked up after a show  And then just didn't see her  For a long time  Yeah  We kept in touch  Randomly  Every year or two  I'd get an email  I'm living in New Orleans now  And blah blah blah  And then  No she wasn't  Then I got the one that  We used to have this party  In Death Valley  In Panamon Springs  Just you know  Like 70 of us  Would get together  Every year  Out in the middle  Of Death Valley  And have our own  You know  Personal burning man  Kind of  That sounds cool  And she had emailed me  And she said  Hey I'm

[01:46:00]  And she was  Again  That was  When she was  Shaved completely bald  I didn't even know  Who she was  When she showed up  At the party  What is that  With like chicks  Shaving their head  When they go a little bonkers  I don't know  It looked good though  Yeah they did  He liked it right  Yeah  You hook up immediately  Uh yeah  Yeah  I was  Yeah we  Just been together  Since then  Yeah pretty much  From certain angles  It would be like  A fucking Kojak  I wouldn't like that  Look at the top of the head  Throw all lollipops out  No more cigarettes  Nice  Nice little  Boot camp fantasy 
[01:46:30]  In there  Yeah  Well  Yeah  A little Jimmy Norton  Fantasy  Yeah I didn't even  Think of that  Yeah you have to ask  Could you have  Some side fat  Is that possible  Could you aspire  To be mediocre  And have side fat  I'd really like that  How long have you been with her  Five years  Exclusive  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Wow damn  No kids right  No  Not looking for that  No she's  She wouldn't do that  She's not one of those people

[01:47:30]  Kind of a thing  But  But  I don't want to  I purely don't want to  Because I like being able to just  Leave  And go somewhere  Whenever the fuck I want  I know  I just have to lock my doors  My dogs fuck up my day enough  Yeah right  You just can't just zip off  You gotta find someone  To sit them  And  Yeah they shop kennels for kids  Where you just put them in a kennel  Put them in a little cage  You don't want  I know why you don't want them  Because you're afraid  That you'd go to jail  By the time they were six  For fucking their friends  Oh  It's play time

[01:49:00]  Everything  And you're like  What the fuck  Just  It's all about  Pack and plays  And fucking  Having to bring shit  Wherever you go  And car seats  That look annoying  To put in  And take out  And just bullshit stuff  Gonna face the kid backwards  It's creepy  You're driving  The fucking ghoulish kid  Is looking out the back window  Making everybody else  On the road uncomfortable  Can't even get blown anymore  Because some fucking  Four year old  Is staring at you  From the car in front of you  The fucking cock blocker

[02:01:00]  Right by the Square Garden right  Yeah yeah  It's on the way out  Where the trains are  So a lot of people commute that way  Yeah  How is it being a celebrity now  I mean  Your life is a little different  Now than it used to be  Well  No  It was better before  Because I had all the money  It was better before the money  Yeah  But the money is always better  Wow  Yeah but  And I'm very remorseful about that too  That's a bad thing I did  I don't  It's not good  You have regret about it?  I sure do  Big time  That's why I'm talking to kids  All over the country now 
[02:01:30]  And what do you tell them  When they  Because again the money  It's hard to say no  To that kind of money  Well who in hell  Wants to stop making  A million dollars a day?  Oof  You know  That's kind of hard to do  But hey  You know what  It was a bad thing that I did  And for that I'm sorry  But this is nothing  Dealing ain't nothing  I can do now  Back in those days  Were there moments  Where you would realize  Like wow  This is a really dangerous thing  That I'm dealing  And feel bad about it  Or would just  Did it not bother you at all?  Always  I always know  It was a dangerous thing 
[02:02:00]  I always know that  But  Would you feel guilty then  Or no?  No  But now I do  Really  What kept you from feeling  Any kind of remorse  Back then  Because obviously  You were in a business  Where people were dying  Yeah  I couldn't  I couldn't go to Wall Street  And get a job  Mopping up  Mopping up the toilets  Yeah  I had to do  I wanted some money  I had to do something  So I started that  And it seemed to be all good  And I went on from there  What got you into that? 
[02:02:30]  Like you know  You're from the south  And what exactly happened  That kind of sparked you  Into that life?  When I was  About six years old  I guess you would call  McClendon  Rednecks  Coming out of our house  And I  Took my first cousin  Out on the  On the porch  And tied his arms up  And shoved the shotgun  And took the butt of the shotgun  Hit him in the mouth with it  Took all the teeth  I took ropes  And tied right in the hand  And shoved the shotgun  Double barrel shotgun  Into his mouth  And put both barrels 
[02:03:00]  Simultaneous  His face looked alright  But you put a watermelon  In the back of his head  So they blew the back  Of his head out  How old was he?  Thirteen  Wow  You know what they got him for?  Reckless eyeballing  Reckless eyeballing  Oh yeah  He looked at a white girl  Walking down the street  Oh boy  That'll do it  So they came  And they  Now they knew you were watching  Or you were kind of  Watching from a window  Or you were sitting  I ran around  When they shot him  I ran around the house  Out the back side  And ran around the house 
[02:03:30]  You know  People around the corner  So you see something like that  I guess when you're six  And the message here  Is that it's like  I've seen somebody  Get shot already  I guess it's a little easier  Man it's fucked up  What I'm gonna say  It messed up  My mind ain't got right yet  Wow  Yeah  I still see it  In my dreams  I see it all the time  Are you someone  Would you consider yourself  I mean a million dollars  A day operation  In what was that  Like 1969  1970  In those days  You got it  Right back then  Would you consider yourself 
[02:04:00]  Would you say  Were you a ruthless guy  In that business  I mean I guess you had to be  Anybody in that business  Tell you not ruthless  They're lying  They have to be  Because you gotta get paid  You know  It's okay  To respect somebody  But when you  When they fear you  That's when you get paid  That's when you get paid  When they fear you  And they were afraid of you  Well  I said fear you  I said fear you  I guess you could say  Scared me  Yeah  How did American Gangster  Portray you  Like Denzel  I thought was tremendous 
[02:04:30]  In that  Do you feel like  He did at least  An accurate job  Of playing you  As a man  Played it to the T  Played it to the T  He did it  He did it  He did  Just what I did  He did it  And a lot  He didn't do  Because I didn't tell him  A lot he didn't do  There were things there  That you kind of  Wanted to keep secret  I mean is it  Statue of Limitations  Things that don't run out  That you kind of wanted to  Got plenty of statues  Let me take you  Don't run out  If I take you everything  I'd probably be in jail  For the rest of my life  What  The interesting thing  About you too  Is that 
[02:05:00]  You were  A rare case  Is that you were  Kind of a  Quiet  Guy  On that level  You weren't a flashy guy  No  Did anything tell you  Not to be that way  Yeah absolutely  I made a mistake  When I went to the  The Muhammad Ali  Boxing match  And  Or that  Chinchilla coat  And the hat  Matching hat  And all that  Kind of stuff  I got flashy  One time in my life  And that was  Bad thing to do  And that was  1971  Or something  Well 
[02:05:30]  When I went to  The Muhammad Ali  And the Joe Frazier  Fight  That's when it was  So  It's an interesting story  Because you were there  They said you had  Better seats than  Sinatra  You had better seats  Than Dustin Hoffman  You had better seats  Than I think  I had better seats  Than anybody  And nobody knew  Who you were  Like the cops  Didn't know who you were  They knew that night  Yeah  You didn't find out  That night  Yes you did  What inspires you  To spend  A hundred thousand dollars  On a jacket  In 1970  Which is how much  The jacket  And a twenty five thousand  Dollar hat  Twenty five thousand 
[02:06:00]  I had a hundred thousand  Dollar for the coat  Wow  What  What caused you  Yeah well I can tell you  That goes back  To the fight  He had in  Atlanta  The guys from California  You know we'd come down  In casual dress  You know going to a fight  Coming casual dress  Them guys had them  Mank coats  Smoking the pipes  And big diamond rings  And all that  You know I don't know  If it was diamonds  Or not  Get a diamond  That big  Cause you  Price a rollercoaster  Probably  But they had that on  And they was  Kind of giggling  I said bring your ass  To New York 
[02:06:30]  I'll show you  So you thought  You were being laughed at  By other guys in there  No  They were laughing  Not the whole New York crowd  They were sneaking about  Yeah  Everybody from New York  Nobody come down  There  Everybody come down  You know that's the fight  But the guys from California  Not the way  They came  All decked out  So when  You're standing there  With a $100,000 coat  And Ali and Frazier  Are both kind of  Stopping and greeting you  On the way into the ring  They did that  They shook my hand  Joe Frazier  Just like  Ali shook my hand  And Joe come by  And give me a big hug 
[02:07:00]  And all that  So that  Made the cops notice  I don't know why  But they did  Well probably  Cause yeah  That would definitely  Be noticeable  You know  That's certainly noticeable  And it's something  You kind of said  You've regretted  Yes I do  I regret that night  And I regret what I did  It wasn't a good thing to do  Nicky Barnes was  Was the guy that  Like I grew up  I'm 41  So I remember  I guess  You know  20 years ago  I would hear about  These legendary  Drug dealers in New York  And Nicky Barnes  Was the guy  You heard about  Even  Well he's like 
[02:07:30]  In jail for life now  Isn't he  Yeah  No he's not in jail no more  Is he out  Yeah  Oh I didn't even know that  He's been out  For about two years now  Three years now  That's called research  That I didn't do  But he did a lot more time  Than you did  Yes he did  Yes he did  Now you want to know  You want to know  I guess you're getting  To the question  The question is  Did you see the movie  I did see the movie  Yeah  Did you see what  The cops did to me  They took like  Two million dollars  A week from me  One time  They were taking from me  Baby facing them 
[02:08:00]  Shaking you down  Shaking me down  They gave me a key  And asked me to sell it for them  And all that bullshit  You know  But what I did was  They put me  They got mad  Because I had an apartment  Over here in the  And one in the regions  I had a top  I had a penthouse  In both of them  Region  And I go there  And I had to hide out  From them  When they saw me  They got mad  And they locked me up  They locked me up  And that's when  The ball started rolling  They locked me  They told on me  Of course I  Of course I got them back  So wait 
[02:08:30]  The cops were taking  At one point  Two million dollars  A week  About six million dollars  More than that  For eight million dollars  A month  Or something like that  They were taking  Half of my pay  How do you distribute  That much  Wow  To bring in  That much money  How do you have  You would need  An army  Of people on the street  Selling  Wouldn't you  Man I had an army  Yeah  Yeah I did  How many people  Did you have working  For you at one point  I had one guy  Working for me  One guy  A guy named Doc  Working for me 
[02:09:00]  Doc Holliday  Working for me  That's all I had  I didn't know nobody else  Didn't see nobody else  Didn't know nothing  About nobody else  He took them from there  And right on down the line  So how did you know  That you weren't being  Stolen from  When you're kind of  Just dealing with one guy  No  I had a friend  Her name was Red Top  She did the cutting  And everything  She passed it out  And she gave me the numbers  And I knew what  I was supposed to have  Now you got  You were really smart  Because you  You know  Guys usually buy drugs  And they're cut  But what made you 
[02:09:30]  Gave you the inspiration  To go to Vietnam  And just get it yourself  From the source  Well  Bill Boutel  And Roger Grimsey  I don't know if you remember  The news guys  Sure  They used to come in there  It was a good evening  He had nice news  That's what he would say  And uh  He was talking about Vietnam  How the guys were getting  High over there  And how painful the drug  Was over there  And all that  I took notice  I said hell  I must get some over there  You know  I'm going to do something  So wait  A news report  On how the guys in Vietnam  Were getting high  And how powerful the drugs  Were kind of inspired  The soldiers  The soldiers  The soldiers 
[02:10:00]  The soldiers  If you make them GIs  High  The makes them high  Over here  You know  So when you went over there  How did you know  Who to go to  Or how did you arrange that  I mean the movie  I did see but  I didn't know  I didn't know  Who to go to  You didn't see that  In the movie  I don't think  It was in the movie  Okay  I didn't know  Who to go  I think it was  Like almost a month  Maybe a little better  Than a month  Looking for somebody  Looking for somebody  Everybody had  20 keys  30 keys  I didn't want that  I wanted a couple  Of hundred keys  And that's what I got  So how did you get  The drugs out of Vietnam  Back here  Military 
[02:10:30]  Through the military  Yes  Oh my god  Come on  Look at what they're  Willing to do  For 800 bucks a month  You get a couple  Hundred grand  You can get anything  You want from the order  Back over here  Okay  So the military  Would help you  Smuggle it  Yes  Look one guy  I get the boss  I would just go  We should go  See the boss  And I can't call his name  I will not call his name  Go see the boss  And he would take you  Out from that  All you have to do 
[02:11:00]  Is bring it on the post  Give it to him  He would do what he had to do  And this is in the US military  Yeah and they tell me  What way to pick it up  What day to pick it up  What time to pick it up  To the military  Precision time  Was anybody  Indicted from the military  No  No huh  Now  That's amazing  When you went  Did you go over to Vietnam  With a tremendous amount  Of money  To  Or did you kind of  Expect it to be fronted  When Bumpy died  He didn't want  He didn't want to do that 
[02:11:30]  Bumpy is the guy  Who you worked for  Bumpy Johnson  Worked for 13 years  Nine months and eight days  I worked for Bumpy  But he was the guy  That  He was the guy  That  Didn't want to do it  So when he died  He had like  Three million dollars  Left in the street  I went and collected  The money  Put in Chase Bank  Because Chase got  Branked all over there  You know  Put in Chase Bank  And I had the money  In the bank  All I had to do  Get a passport  Enough money  To get there  When I had money  You know  How do you wash  A million dollars a day  I mean  Because back  Especially  It's all cash  You didn't read 
[02:12:00]  You didn't  You didn't  You must have  Didn't read about me much  Because if you did  You'd know how I did it  Well I know you had  A couple of  Legitimate businesses  You had  No  I did it through the bank  For the most part  I had a few  Legitimate businesses  But I worked  Did it through the bank  I'd take it to the bank  Did it clean it up  I'd pick it up tomorrow  Like five million  Ten million  Went up  I had to take it in  That they'd clean it up  I'd pick it up tomorrow  Chemical bank  They got indicted for that  Oh they did  Chemical bank for laundering  Yeah they got  Indicted for that  Yes they did  How much would you  Bring it at a time 
[02:12:30]  And like  I don't  I don't know how it works  Like you say you have  Ten million dollars  And you want to  Wash it  You bring it to the bank  And what do you  They'd clean it up  They'd give me  All hundred dollar bills  And how much would they  Charge for a ten million dollar  They'd take two percent  Or three percent  Sometimes  Much as four percent  I have paid  Alright so basically  That's not that much  That seems like  No  No it's not that much  No it's not  But they would make  That was a good dollar  For them  So where do you keep  Once they wash it for you  Where do you keep  That kind of cash  In the Cayman Islands 
[02:13:00]  Oh you put it in the Caymans  Yes  And I know you stored  Some in your house  Which  No  I  I had like twelve million dollars  Twelve million  Oh five hundred  Some thousand dollars  But when they turned it in  It wasn't but a  Five hundred thousand  So you had twelve million  And they raided the house  Yeah  And they said they found  A half a million  That's why they said  They found  You read that  Oh man  Oh shenanigans  Next thing you know  The cops showing up  In the fight  With a hundred thousand 
[02:13:30]  Dollar for a coat  On and a twenty five  Thousand dollar hat  Hey Flatfoot  You don't make that  Kind of scratch  I don't know how  They did it  But all I know  The money wasn't there  I don't know  Who took it or what  But I know  It wasn't there  So did a lot of  There was a whole  Corruption thing  That happened  After you got in trouble  There was a lot of  Cops that I think  Went down right  Absolutely  How many guys  Were actually  You know  I have no idea  I don't know  I don't know  I have no idea  But I know  Maybe twenty five  Or thirty  Maybe more  And the guys  That were actually 
[02:14:00]  Taking from you  They went  Like the guys  That were taking you  They told on me  I told on them  Simple as that  I told on them  Have you  Like  Being a guy  Who's kind of  Been  It's amazing  To be  You're seventy nine  Yeah  And most guys  In that business  Don't tell my age  On the radio  I'm sorry  I'm only kidding  I'm only kidding  I'm seventy nine years old  I was on September 9th  1930  Most guys  Don't  In that line of work  Don't make it to seventy nine 
[02:14:30]  To kind of  Come out the other side of it  And write books  And talk about what happened  Well  I don't know about most  But I know  I've been lucky I guess  I guess I've been lucky  How have you seen that  Change  Like you know  I mean there's always guys  Dealing drugs  How has the mentality  Of these guys changed now  From the time  When you were doing it  Well  It's  Different  Back then you had rules  The kids out there  They don't have no rules  They kill one another  Murder one another  For nothing  For twenty dollars  They kill you for twenty dollars 
[02:15:00]  They murder you  We didn't do it back then  Like Bumpy  And all those times  They had rules  I fell in the same footsteps  I had rules  I went by  What was  What was the rule  You think that  That you would have  Abided by  That today  That they just  Don't care about  The rules  I've abided by  You gotta be straight  You see you can  You see that's why  I had all most  Country boys  Work for me  You can trust  The country boy  You can put a million  Dollars in his house  And his wife  And kids can be hungry  He won't touch  Nate Penny  Before he come tell you  But a city boy 
[02:15:30]  That son of a bitch  Would steal your eyeballs out  That son of a bitch  Steal your eyeballs out  I had people  I could trust  Put it that way  If they legalized drugs  Would you get back  In the business  No  No  I don't want  Nothing to do with drugs  Would you franchise  No  No more drugs  No more drugs  No  No  Absolutely not  Alright  Absolutely not  No more drugs  Never  Never  I'm very remorseful  What I did  And it's not a good thing  What I did  But hey  It's a done deal  And just move on  That much I can do  Best I can do  Talk to the kids 
[02:16:00]  And tell them  Don't go this way  When did that change  In your mind  When did you realize  Wow  That's not a good thing  Well we had a trial  I don't know if you know  The guy named Richard Roberts  He was a state prosecutor  We had a trial over there  And the lady  Said she come home  We was on trial  She said she come home  And she'd find her son  With a needle in his arm  And when she got  Through testifying  That day  Even I was crying  Damn  Even I was crying  When she got through  Testifying  I know I was gone 
[02:16:30]  I know there ain't  No come back now  You know  When she got through  Testifying  I felt very remorseful  And I felt like a dog  And I ain't never  Touched drugs since  Do you mean  Because hearing somebody  Actually really describe  What it was like  To watch  What it was like  Yeah  She told a whole story  They must have  Practiced her  Two months  Six months  Oh damn  She knew every word  You know how to put  Oh my god  That lady was  Hey  You'd have been crying  As you said in there  Before that  It was just business  For you  It was just  Business as usual  Yeah  It was a product  That you were selling 
[02:17:00]  My wife tried to get me  To stop a long time ago  But who the hell  Wants to stop  Making a million dollars  A day you know  That's hard to just stop  Yeah  Stop riding your tracks  You know  And I'm getting from  I move from  A couple hundred  To three thousand keys  When I go over there  And bring it back  So three thousand  I stopped drinking  And doing drugs  When I was eighteen  So I don't know  How much does a key  Cost and how much  Does it resell for you  Well in New York  In New York  Over this way  It was selling for like  Maybe  Maybe eighty thousand 
[02:17:30]  Seventy thousand  For a key  Over there  I was paying  Four thousand  Two hundred for it  Oh wow  That's a hell of a profit  Forty two hundred  And it sells for  Eighty thousand  Oh yeah  Yeah  And if I  It was like a hundred percent  I never got nothing  Under the ninety eight percent  Like a hundred percent  And I could cut a half in two  And sell it over here  For eighty thousand  If I wanted to  Yeah so that's like  But I had a street business  Going  I had  I was selling a lot  In the streets  I was selling a lot  A million dollar a day  That was just my street business  Had nothing to do with the wholesale 
[02:18:00]  So you didn't have  People that were  Selling  To  People that were using  Were you pretty much  Selling bulk  To other dealers  No  The guy named Doc  He run the street business  For me  Oh okay  And how he did it  I know  But it's a long story  So I don't have time  To tell all that  Here on the radio today  But anyhow  He run the street business  And I run more  To the wholesale business  What was the name of  Didn't you have  The name of the actual  Blue Magic 
[02:18:30]  Blue Magic  Yeah  And that kind of became  Legendary on the streets  Yes  It still is  I mean  A friend of mine  The same name  Blue Magic  They know exactly  What you're talking about  You could sue  Yeah  Super copyright infringement  Yeah yeah right  I don't think  Yeah I don't think  That's a good idea  Are you alright  You alright  Yeah  Yeah Sam  Okay  Is he bothering you  No no  I don't mind  I would love to see you  Punch Sam  That would really make me happy  He bothers us 
[02:19:00]  Thank you  Oh that's good  They bring the book  In a plastic bag  Like it's some kind of drugs  What are you doing  What is that  It's the film  American Gang  I want to get the book signed  I autograph it  Before I leave  Sure will  So  Do you think  The Rico Statutes  Which kind of  Put a lot of  Years on people  Did that change  The whole game as well  Because now guys  Couldn't just take  A five year hit  No  The Rico Statutes  That was  A prosecutor dream  Hmm 
[02:19:30]  It didn't have to go  That much  To convict you  All they had to do  Is somebody  Like we sitting here  Talking about drugs now  They know you're not  In drugs  But they come back  Y'all talking about  You should have  Told the courts  Or whatever it is  You should have  Told the courts  And you didn't know  You know about it  So you should have  Report it  You know  As a Rico Statute  They can get to  Anything  So then  Jimmy goes away  They put everything together  So they can  Kind of lump us all in  As a  As conspirators  And I think  The thing with that  Is this way  They get lower guys 
[02:20:00]  To roll over  On the guys  That's exactly  That's exactly  That's exactly  I'm telling you  When I was in court  I had guys  That I'd never seen before  They said  They worked for me  And I  Who the hell are you  You know  Where do you come from  Nose running  Snodding  High in the courtroom  Tell me he worked for me  No the hell  You didn't work for me  They were just trying  To give something  To lighten their own sentence  That's exactly what they did  What is it like  When someone is testifying  Against you  Terrible  You don't want to hear it  You don't want to hear it  No you don't  Does it make you angry 
[02:20:30]  Of course it do  Of course it makes you angry  Somebody telling something  On you  Where you know  You didn't have nothing  To do with it  That would make you  Pissed off too  Did you ever have to  Face somebody in court  Who you had trusted  At one point  Who like at one point  You would have confided in them  And then just to hear  Them blabbing  Well  Once I had a guy  Named Charles Morris  On the stand  Testifying against me  And he helped me out  He really helped me out  He really helped me out  Didn't get convicted  Because his testimony  He know what he was doing  I know him 
[02:21:00]  He know what he was doing  And I would like to  Shake his hand today  But I don't know  Where the hell he's at  Oh so he didn't hang out  To dry  No he didn't  He helped me out  He helped me out  He got on the stand  He helped me out  He couldn't remember  Bye bye bye  And when the  Defense lawyer asked  Well that wasn't the way  It was  You know  Bye bye bye  Oh he might have had  A change of heart  Yeah  Absolutely  Absolutely  Absolutely  I don't know  If they locked him up  For that or not  But I know  He helped me a lot  I would think a lot  Of people would  Be intimidated  To go up against you  In court like that 
[02:21:30]  Yeah  Man he helped me out a lot  I'm telling you  How do guys now treat you  Because you are  You don't know many  Ex-drug dealers names  I mean  You're like a legendary guy  Especially since the film  Do guys kind of  Approach you now  And try to ask you  For advice about it  Or what's the reaction  To guys in that business now  I got a lot of people  Ask me for advice on that  And I tell them  Like I'm telling you  Man stay away from that  That's no good  They got so they  Don't ask me no more  Because they know  What I'm going to say  They know you're not  Going to give them  Business advice  No hell no 
[02:22:00]  I'm not going to do that  Business advice  I know it would just  Seem like an odd thing  To do  But yeah  Even  But it's the truth  They do  They actually  Come up  Wow that's  That's  That's a dumb thing  For people to do  So this was also  Interesting to me too  In the 80's  When crack became  That also seemed to  Change the way  Business was done  Crack changed  The whole thing  You know what  See  See cocaine is a  Is a  Used to be a rich man 
[02:22:30]  Drug  And then it got  So they  Refined it  Down to crack  And everybody  Started smoking it  And they went crazy  They went crazy  Smoking that shit  Went crazy  That's what they did  What do you think is  The Jamaican gangs  At one point  They seem to be  Breaking a lot of rules  That like the mafia had  That other traditional  Drug dealers had  Like when they shot  Ed Byrne the cop  I think it was his name  Ed Byrne  They executed him  Guarding a witness  It was like they  Were just doing  These things  That other guys 
[02:23:00]  Didn't do  Which kind of  Forced the police  To react  And I think  They react in  The appropriate way  In a case like that  You just don't do that  If a cop get you  You got  You don't try to  Kill no cop  No you don't  You take  That's their job  To catch you  They catch you  Say hey  They got me  That's it  You don't go  Try to kill him  No the hell  You don't  You don't do that  That's one of the rules  That are being broken  You don't do that  If it wasn't for the cop  We'd be in trouble  We'd be in big trouble  You know 
[02:23:30]  Because it just brings  Heat on everybody  That's what they do  Bring heat on everybody  Them kind of guys  Bring heat on everybody  Yes they do  They don't know  What the hell they're doing  And it seems like  The Jamaican guys  Had a few years  Of a run  Where they were  Violent  And they were making  A lot of money  But then they were gone  Because they forced  The people to come after them  They were putting  Their ass in jail  Putting them away for life  And that stopped all that  You know  Nobody wants to go to jail  For life  Nobody  How much time did you do  How much jail time  Did you actually do  Well I can give you  The longest time I had  The longest time I had 
[02:24:00]  I did like seven and a half  Eight years  One time  Right down in Park Road  So what's it like  Being a guy  Who's making a million dollars  A day  And having pretty much  The run of the city  And then just being forced  To  Well I had to run to the jail  Oh you did  Yeah  I don't know why  I would assume  That he'd go to jail  I had to run to the jail  Yes I did  Yeah  Alright so you're out of the life  Now for a pretty long time  I'm out of life  Permanently  Permanently  Yeah  And you're doing a signing tonight  I'm going to give out  The information again too 
[02:24:30]  Now this  What is the difference  Between this book  And it's called  Original Gangster  The real life story  Of one of America's  Most notorious drug lords  And  The signing tonight  Six o'clock  At Borders  Penn Station  Which is at  Madison Square Garden  What is the difference  Between this book  And kind of the story  Of American Gangster  Or is it  Is it kind of the same  The book is not  The book is never  Like the picture  I'm telling  That's my autobiography  I'm telling you  The truth in that  Okay  Everything is right  On the money  Nothing elaborated  For Hollywood 
[02:25:00]  I didn't cut  No corners there  Did you write  American Gangster  Or was that written  About you  That was written  About me  I didn't write it  No  Oh so this is actually  Okay the first one  That's coming from you  Yes  The American Gangster  Is coming from me  Are there any  Things in the film  That didn't happen  That  That you looked at  I'm not gonna tell you that  No huh  Okay  I think  There is  I'm not on air anyway  Yeah  There is one scene  Which you don't have to  Yeah yeah  That's what I'm thinking about  We're all thinking of  The same scene  Yes the same scene  Where Denzel  On the street  Walks in the street  And just 
[02:25:30]  The guy's played by  Idris Elba  Who was  String a bell on the wire  And he just walks up  And he shoots him  In the head  In the middle of the street  I don't know nothing about that  Alright Frank knows  Nothing about this  No statue  I'm taking his word for it  That was just a good scene  In the movie  They got to jack it up  For Hollywood  You know that  Yeah  Yeah  Did Frank Lucas  At his prime  Get more pussy  Than Denzel Washington  That's a good question  Everything from  8th Avenue  From Hollywood movie  To 8th Avenue  You're a hoe  A little bit of it all 
[02:26:00]  Yeah  Stanhope  He asked a good question  You were having  An affair with  Willie Mays' daughter  No stepdaughter  Stepdaughter  Yeah  Your stepdaughter  Did Willie know about that  I don't know  How did that  Willie never came around  Then he never came around  Willie doesn't bother  Them no more  Didn't you steal a girl  From Wilt Chamberlain  Or was it  Another athlete  Yeah  How do I put this 
[02:26:30]  I really don't know  How to put it  Yeah I got a girl  Yes  From Wilt Chamberlain  Yes I did  According to Wilt though  You probably  You probably  Had a girl  That Wilt had  Yeah Wilt did  Fuck everybody  But yeah  There was some  Story about how  You were at a party  And there was somebody  That he was with  That just  Left with you  In my club  I had a night club  Down in 51st  Or 52nd  And Broadway  The Old Birdland  The Turntable  You probably heard  About that  The Old Turntable 
[02:27:00]  Old Birdland  You heard about  Old Birdland  You heard about  Birdland didn't you  No  You're a New York guy  I grew up in Jersey  Well hell you're right  Cause really you had to  Hear about Birdland  I was a nerd  And I right there  Right downstairs  I had a club  That was called  The Turntable  Lord Price Turntable  You know who  Lord Price is don't you  No who's Lord Price  He's a good friend of mine  Lord and Miss Claudia  You got personality  And that kind of thing  No  Oh my god  Where the hell you been  I know  I lived a sheltered life 
[02:27:30]  Yes you did  I did a little drugs  I drank a little bit  So you  You just  Was there anybody  In that period of time  When you're making  That kind of money  And everybody's kind of  Is there anybody  That you were afraid of  Or that were intimidated by  How could I be  Out in the street  During the business  I wasn't  Like I wouldn't be  Intimidated  Well that's what I'm saying  Well that's  That's self explanatory  Hell no  Nobody  Nobody  And if there was  You wouldn't have  Allowed them to know it  I don't think 
[02:28:00]  They could have  Been around too long  They're going to  Intimidate me  That is pretty  Self explanatory  Yeah it is  Known as a business  That you don't want  Competition  Around  Yeah well hey  I didn't have no competition  Because the stuff  I was getting  I was putting like  10% in the street  Everybody was putting  Like 5, 6, 7%  And they bought  My stuff  But I didn't care  Who sold  Yeah you don't see  That work ethic  With drug dealers  Nowadays  That's something  Of the past  You just get  Shitty drugs now  Did you  Did you have  Situations where 
[02:28:30]  There were people  That were  Kind of trying to  Edge in on  Your business  And had to be  Dealt with  They could sell  Right beside me  I didn't care  Because they  Were going to  Buy their stuff  Anyway  They were going to  Buy my stuff  I had the best stuff  I told you I was  Getting it for free  Almost  They could compete  So a lot of times  The big violence happens  Because guys are  Fighting over territory  See that's bullshit  If you're out  In the street  And you're in  The drug business  You got to have  The best  Because if you 
[02:29:00]  Don't have the best  You ain't going to  Make no money  So you got to  Have the best  I made a lot of money  I had the best  All the time  Were you always afraid  Like alright  This is going to  End someday  It's like you're  Pretty much just  Living like  I know this is  Going to end  Very very  I mean how  What's your mentality  When that's happening  About getting caught  I was a damn fool  I didn't care  I didn't care  I didn't think  About tomorrow  You're just living  Day to day  I didn't save my money  And put my money up  And make sure  That when I got ready  I could retire  Never have to worry 
[02:29:30]  No more  That's what I did  The government  Took all my money  Yeah what would  Yeah what would  You say on tax  Like would you file taxes  Back then  Or would you just not  Now you want me  To say that  I'm ready  You'll help  Plus you did have  Legitimate businesses  So that could  Yeah  I paid tax  I paid tax  On my business  And stuff  Yes I did  But you went to jail  I mean you did your time  It's like  You're free and clear  Now right  I mean  Yeah I don't know  Nobody nothing  Now  It's got to be  A nice feeling  Right  Yeah  The best feeling  I ever had

[02:32:00]  Which really is  You know North Brunswick  It's not Newark  It's a very soft  I'm from Long Island  We get  We get  We get  They get  They get a lot of killers  In Newark  You read about it all the time  Oh yes  Yeah  A lot of gangs  Yeah a lot of gangs  Gang violence  The Crips and the Bloods  And all that shit  Yeah  They're going crazy  That seems very unnecessary  All that killing  I would think so  I would think so  But they young boys  They want to do their thing  How about it y'all  What happened to fist fighting though  Or maybe knives and chains 
[02:32:30]  That ain't in their category no more  No  Fist fighting  They don't want that  And stepping on your foot  Is disrespect now  They go the short way home man  The way they can kill you  That's what they do  And they do it in a hurry  There's one thing I wanted to ask you too  Before we go  You're right  Like there's so many things  That are considered disrespectful now  Where guys are just shooting each other  Over nothing  Over nothing  Were you at all forgiving  I don't mean of people  Who stole money from you  But were there people  That could do something  That would be considered  Accidentally disrespectful 
[02:33:00]  That you would have been forgiving for  I guess all the time  You know  I wasn't a guy  I wasn't that kind of violent guy  I was just  Howling my business  And don't fuck with me  Simple as that  No nonsense guy  When it came to the business  No nonsense  Yeah  No nonsense  Like if you found out  Wilt Chamberlain had fucked  Willie Mays' stepdaughter  After you'd been there  That wouldn't  Now you out of line  Damn  I knew Stan Hope would fuck up  Yeah  We knew if anyone was gonna fuck up 
[02:33:30]  It was gonna be him  Were you possessive with women  Or did you kind of look at it like  You know  I'll date this one  I'll date that one  Or were you guys who fell in love  You don't wanna know something  I'm sitting on this  On what is it  Soundlight radio  Yeah  This is all over the world  I guess  Yeah  If I ever been in love  I don't know nothing about it  Really  Yeah  I don't know nothing about it  Do you feel like  Well yeah  One time  I guess one time  Back when I was 18 or 19  I was crazy about this girl  But that's about it  You feel like you missed out  On something by  Having the life that you had  And missing out on maybe 
[02:34:00]  You know  The love  And  A family life  I don't wanna be there  I don't  I was a family man  Don't mistake that  Don't take no mistake by that  I was a family man  But love  I respect my wife  And do anything for her  And didn't do no  Whole lot of cheating on her  Not a whole lot  No  I like that one  But  It's a fact  Didn't do no  A lot of cheating on her  But what I did was  Kind of kept it clean  And did what I wanted to  Inspect in my home  Sometimes I wouldn't come home 
[02:34:30]  For three months  Wow  So I'd be in  Be in  La Paz  That's a  Wait  I'd be in La Paz  Or in Chile somewhere  Hawaii  All over the world  I'd be  You know  I'd be  Cause I'd go someplace  And I wanted to do  What I call  Bike tracking  Lay up in a hotel  On the sandy beach somewhere  And think back  Through the years  And see how I did  For the last two years  With the cop close to me  What I did wrong  What I should do  How I should clean it up 
[02:35:00]  I was at that 14 years  Before they even know my name  Oh so you would basically  Go away  And just kind of  Collect your thoughts  And strategize  Exactly what I would do  Exactly what I would do  Assess what you're doing wrong  Maybe fix a few things  Yeah  Stay a couple of steps ahead  Spiritual retreat  Yeah right  Do all that  And straighten everything up  And clean it up  Clean it up  And go to work again  Getting jammed up for so long  14 years  Before I didn't even know my name  And Nicky Barnes  I really thought he was in jail for life  I didn't realize he had been out 
[02:35:30]  For a while now  He'd been out like two  Maybe three years now  Okay  Do you guys have a good relationship  Or do you have no relationship  I have no relationship with Nicky  No?  None at all  No  I considered Nicky  Back then  He was an associate  Couldn't call him a friend  Because it was a cutthroat  Hmm  Couldn't call him a friend  I didn't have no friend  What I consider cutthroats  So I just  He did his thing  I did my thing  He didn't step on my toes  I didn't step on his  Hey see you  Hi Nick  Hey Frank  Bye  You know 
[02:36:00]  One of them things  But he did  He did send his wife  To see me  When I was in Rackets Island  He sent Thelma  To see me  About  About putting that picture  In the magazine  Mr. Untouchable  I told him  Don't do that shit man  Wait what picture  We're not familiar with that  Time magazine  Time magazine  Sunday edition  Of Time magazine  He put his picture  In there like  All dressed up  I'm Mr. Untouchable  They know I know  But they can't catch me  Oh shit  I'm Mr. Untouchable  A picture of himself  Yeah  A big suit 
[02:36:30]  And everything  That's not smart  No  Draw attention to yourself  Smart  That was the stupid shit  You ever could do man  Yeah  Then you're forcing them  To come after you  Yeah  But the president  Kind of did  He told  He shot up  Yeah  He told the prosecutor  I think his name was Fist  I'll never forget that  He want him  To prosecute the case himself  Nobody else  No subject  Want him to prosecute  The case himself  I want Nicky Bond  And they got him  Damn  Yeah I guess  When you put it out there  That way  It becomes embarrassing  To the police  Oh yeah 
[02:37:00]  It's embarrassing to the country  Yep  I mean it's embarrassing  To the country  Yeah we got a  Hell of a police force  And they can't  Catch this motherfucker  I'm sorry  No you can curse  Satellite  You can't  Catch this guy  Yeah what is he doing  What are y'all doing up there  You know  That's what he want to know  And Fist  No one went at him  They got him  They got him  They got him big time  Yeah he did a lot of years  They got live  Possibility parole  But how did he get out  I think  I think  Mr. Juliana 
[02:37:30]  Had him to sign  Had the president  To sign something  He went to bat for him  I think  Oh Juliana did  Yeah I think  He went to bat for him  Wow  Is he a guy  Who like turned his life around  Or was there other stuff  That they wanted to talk about  That he  Well he had done  Told everything  Then he just wanted him  Out of jail I guess  Wow  Okay  Life without parole  And then he gets out  Yeah  I don't know how that happens  I guess he just wanted him  Out of jail  Mr. Juliana  He was a good prosecutor  He was a good man  He was a good man  He promised you something  He used to get it  He used to count on it  You know  Oh yeah 
[02:38:00]  I didn't ever deal with him  I never deal with him  He was going to prosecute me  But he had to go to Washington  Be his sister attorney general  So he turned over  Dominic Amorosa  I guess y'all might know that name  I don't know  Juliana we know  I don't know Dominic  Yeah Dominic  He was a hell of a lawyer  Hell of a lawyer  And he prosecuted you  Yes he did  And you have no animosity  Towards the man who prosecuted you  I don't know  He helped me get out of jail  Oh is that the Russell Crowe character  In the film or no  No  Russell Crowe character  Richard Roberts  Okay  Richard Roberts  But Richard did not  He really didn't 
[02:38:30]  He got me on a subsequent indictment  He didn't arrest me  And DEA got me  They took me down  Alright and then he defended you  Who?  Richard didn't  Who became your lawyer  When you got in trouble again  Was it  Jeff Hoffman  So it wasn't the same guy  That prosecuted you  That offended you?  No  He would become my lawyer  After I got out of jail for a minute  Roberts  Richard Roberts  Okay  Alright I kind of knew  I had something there  Yeah  Alright I don't know  What I'm talking about  At this point  Frank Lucas

[02:40:00]  I have to piss  And we'll be  Right back  Hey Ovi and Anthony  The show  How's everybody  Everybody today  Good  I certainly hope so  Well that was  That was interesting  And a little  Intimidating  Norton handled the shit  Out of that  Norton  Norton was the man  Norton was the man  Sitting right next to him  How much of that was research  And how much  Research  What is that  What is that word 
[02:40:30]  You speak of  I'm talking about  Norton  He knew his shit  Jimmy knew his shit  He'd seen the movie  He's also  Jimmy is kind of a  Crime connoisseur  He kind of likes  That whole thing  He knows a lot about  People like  Escobar  That you know  Yeah  And a bunch of the other  Drug kingpins  Yeah no he was just  Dropping random cop murders  From Jamaican drug gangs  And then the Jamaican guys  Some people are looking at Jimmy  See what he's been up to  In the past  He lives too squeaky clean 
[02:41:00]  I bet there's something going on  Other than  Sexual deviance  After Frank Lucas leaves  Jimmy's  Got the book autographed  And he's  He's cracking the book  And he's thumbing through the pages  And he  He puts his face down in it  And sniffs it  Like it's pussy  Yeah Jimmy likes smelling books  And uh  And electronics  Like if he opens up  Is it just a new ink smell  Or does a different book  Have a different smell  I think he just likes  The new page smell  I understand a piece of that 
[02:41:30]  I mean like  I like the way  Like when you open up  A new piece of electronics  Like it does smell good  And like if you get  Like a new Xbox game  Like that new  That new game smells  New game smell  I kind of understand that  Of course  I get it  But it was like  Well growing up  With the uh  The dittos  In school  We got the dittos  Yeah it came off  It was like  The blue ink  Oh the mimeographs  Yeah and it smelled  Oh they would say  Take one and pass it back  And you wouldn't  And you'd  Smell that  It was almost like  Fifth grade drugs  Yeah  Like oh that smells good 
[02:42:00]  I like that  But Jimmy yeah  Kind of likes the um  The smell of uh  Books  Electronics  And Sharpies  It's a white house  A brand new Sharpie  Smells really good too  It does give you  A nice little like  Oh that's good  Tangy  That's tangy  Jimmy Norton  We were just praising you  On your uh  Your wonderful interview  With the  Your research  Your knowledge  Oh thanks  I thought I was being  Horrible  No no  It was very good  Oh thank you  Cause when you get  An old codger like that  Sometimes it's hard 
[02:42:30]  Uh you know  Uh they don't really  Elaborate much on things  That guy did need  Subtitles a few times  He was a southern guy  I couldn't tell  When he was talking  About the witness  That he was facing  I couldn't tell  If he was helping him  Or fucking him over  Yeah he's holding me up  He's holding me up  He's holding me up  Yeah it's a heavy accent  He's holding me up  And I'm like  Alright  Did he help you  Do you want to  Shake his hand  Or shoot him  Just tell me that much  What do you  John Rivers is in the  I just hired a  John Rivers  And she went through  Oh yeah  Uh yeah  We don't get her  On the show  Oh no  John's here 
[02:43:00]  I just fucking love her man  I wish she would come on  She's doing a pre-tape  With Rana Fez  She'll be on Rana Fez today  Oh a pre-tape  I'm assuming that's what it is  Yeah if she's here  Until 11  Fuck  She's gonna do it  Have you met her before  Many times  Yeah she doesn't remember me  But I got a photo with her  You're not very memorable  I really  Someone like that though  She's iconic  I don't take it personally  But I really love fucking  She's the funniest person  She's fucking hilarious  I wonder why  Should I just pop in  I don't know  It's probably  Either cause she thinks  Us and Stern don't get along 
[02:43:30]  Or it's about her  Who knows  And I just don't know  I don't even see a problem  Between the  I don't either  Two camps  It's like  Too much time  Too much water  Under the bridge  It's like  Now it's just silly  It's just like  Alright you know what  They do their thing  We do our thing over here  And we meet in the hallways  I think a lot of the audience  Likes to hold on to it  Because  Yeah you know something  You're right  People are always happier  If it's a contest 
[02:44:00]  Or some kind of  Combative situation  Yeah if there's some kind of  Battle going on  But the truth of the matter is  We haven't had  A real reason  To go at it  For years  I mean it's fucking  You know  We buy cars from Japan now  We drop two bombs  On the motherfuckers  Jesus Christ  You could get over things  Yeah  It's just  Yeah  I have no problem  Or animosity  For anybody down the hall  I really don't  I could care less  One way or the other  I just come in here  Let me do my fucking job 
[02:44:30]  Let me go home  I'm bummed she wouldn't  Come in and talk  I didn't ask her to  But I'm bummed  That we don't get her  Because  I fucking love Joan  I'll go ask her  Nah she's already doing  They have a schedule  At this point they can't  Yeah  So what  Ron and Fez are doing  Thank you  I don't know  I'm assuming  I don't even know  If she's with them right now  Maybe she might actually  Be in live for them  I don't  I'm just assuming  That's what it was  But I could be wrong  I listen to Ron and Fez  On the way home  And I'm so bummed  About the Dave situation  Yeah man  I'm so bummed about that 
[02:45:00]  It's the Dave situation  Dave  Eastside Dave  Was a guy  That was on their show  And he just couldn't afford  To keep doing their show  A three hour commute  Each way  From Jersey  To here  And I guess  He tried to get a raise  But they didn't want to give him  What he was asking  What he needed  To actually do the job  Yeah  Look at that leprechaun  Looking motherfucker  Look at his picture  I hear about Ron and Fez  All the time  I hear really good things  They're great  They're great 
[02:45:30]  And Dave was just  A great addition  To the show  And now  To hear the show  Without him  There's just such  A huge gap  A huge hole  In the program  Where  Like Ronnie  Will say something  And you know  What Dave would chime in with  And you're just waiting  To hear his idiotic mouth  Open up  Out of his big pink face  With his curly  Raggy red hair  And say something funny  Everyone thought  Everyone thought  It was just a bit too 
[02:46:00]  Like everybody was like  Okay  No  He was really an idiot  No  Oh  No I know  Everybody thought  It was  Alright he'll be back  Later on in the show  Oh gee well  Like Ron and Fez  Haven't worked  Works in the past  Especially with Dave  And things like that  It was one of those things  But unfortunately  It is true  And  He's missed man  I missed the guy  I was texting him  The other day  It's like  Fucking sucks  They just have a  They just have a  Producer curse  They really do  I mean  First  First with Harry T 
[02:46:30]  Well  First when they had to have Earl  And then  And then Earl  That was the curse  When Earl didn't leave  Right away  And uh  Yeah they do have  Just a  How come we can't have  A curse like this  Oh my god  We do  He stays  Ours is like  A fucking embedded tick  You guys have forgotten  And in scale  It's the same size  You guys have forgotten  About Pitsy  Ah right  Pitsy  Super producer Pitsy  Pitsy  Was another one  Um  Al Dukes 
[02:47:00]  Who went on to  Bigger and Better Things  Yeah  Is he still over at CBS  Or did they  Unceremoniously  Throw his ass out too  Like they do  Everybody else over there  I believe he's  The executive producer  Of Boomer's Morning Show  Is he?  Yep  And what about  The other guy  That was the producer  Or intern  Or some shit over there  Pitsy?  At CBS  Oh  CBS  Uh  CBS  Yeah he ended up like  Almost being our boss  I just forget these names  I don't know who you're talking about  Cause I could give a shit  He was the guy we like  Had to report to 
[02:47:30]  Oh  Oh  Yeah shit  I'll look it up  I can't remember his name  Ah  I know I hate that  Yeah  Why is it when you need  A name of somebody  And you try to think of it  You just fucking  Draw a fucking blank  The bosses didn't talk to us  Much over there  No  We were more like  We were XM property  You guys were  A burden  Over there  You were XM property  And there was no reason  For you guys to 
[02:48:00]  Be there  We were basically  As far as they were concerned  The CD players  The producers  Yeah yeah  It was just a machine  Yeah  That's it  But now  The Eastside Dave  And what's he gonna do  Work at that  If he moves down to where  West Virginia  North Carolina  North Carolina  I don't know  One of those states  And works at his uncle  That would be awful  At his uncle's factory  That makes  You know what they make  You know those  Those seats  That go up the stairs  For old people  Ah  That connect it to the wall 
[02:48:30]  Yes  Could you see Eastside Dave  He makes the dicks  That get nailed onto those seats  He tests them  Yes  Make sure  They're not too short  Yeah  Ah god  Oh yes  It was Chris Oliveira  Yeah  Oh yeah  We had a very little  Interaction with him  Yeah  Chris was  He was a get me coffee  Shithead guy  At  NEW  For everybody  And then  You know  He's like your boss  And you're like  No 
[02:49:00]  You're a get me coffee guy  So that was weird  And  I don't know  So then  Eastside Dave  He just  God  They should have  Just paid him  He's got such an asset  To the show  Yeah I know  For what he was looking for  It would have been  A drop in the bucket  And I'm not gonna sit here  And you know  And bad mouth the company  I'm not gonna sit here  And just bad mouth the company  I mean  They got their reasons  For what they do  However inane they are  This company sucks  Yeah  I had nothing to lose  I thought I'd throw in for you 
[02:49:30]  But it's like  In this situation  As I see it  The guy  Is such an asset  To  The show  Was  Was  Which made him  An asset  To the company  And  And as far as  On air talent goes  They can't be treated  Like  Like the guys  That work in the office  I'm sorry  It's just a different thing  You can't use  A slide rule  Of pay raises  To dole out  To the talent  Because some people  Don't deserve  What they're getting  Other people deserve 
[02:50:00]  A lot more  Than they're getting  And  And Dave  Was one of those guys  That deserved a lot more  Than he was getting  That was a problem though  Because when you pass it  Through HR  His title  Says producer  But he wasn't  A producer  But it doesn't matter  What he was  Which isn't considered  On air  Right  So he can't just go  But you know what  Take the semantics  And fucking  Look at the guy  Here's a person  Look at what he's doing  Yeah  No he's a guy  Fucking title on a piece of paper  That says producer  No it should have said  Red headed douche bag  Yeah 
[02:50:30]  That just  Was definitely worth  A lot more than  Than they were giving him  And now  Remember the time  He put R2D2  Up his ass  He put an R2D2  Up his ass  And then put it  In his mouth  That's not worth  The money  Fantastic  How many shitty tattoos  Does he have on himself  For the rest of his life  Because he was on that show  He's got the  Awful Sopranos  Oh  He's got Lucky Boy  Tattooed on his arm  Which he didn't realize  Until after he got it  Is a pedophile prison term  And of course  His favorite 
[02:51:00]  On the inside of his arm  The whackbag.com logo  He likes that one?  Oh yes  And he was branded  Right  He was branded  Oh yeah  And the itchy bond  On the ass cheeks  And itchy bond  On his ass  They heated it up  With a torch  And branded him  This motherfucker  Would do anything  Not only that  But the tattoos  That he got  Willingly are terrible  As well  Well that's true  The Sopranos tattoo  It is so bad  It looks like  Me, Doug, Anthony  And Frank Lucas  It looks nothing 
[02:51:30]  Like the Sopranos  Oh and he's got his  New York Giants logo  That's colored in  Instead of royal blue  It's turquoise  Turquoise  Right  Right  Yeah  It just looks  The shade of blue  And now he's got to  Walk around with those  See if you're in radio  It doesn't matter  It's goofy  It's like  Did you guys do this to him  Or did Ron and Fez  Yeah yeah  Ron and Fez  He had nothing to do  With the whack bag thing  No  No he was just  A Ron and Fez guy  He'd come on our show  Every so often  The R2-D2  Up the ass  R2-D2 was us  Ass to mouth R2-D2  We played a game 
[02:52:00]  Over at SM  I don't want to lose that guy  I know  It was called  Guess what's up Dave's ass  Yes  And Dave would come out  With something shoved up his ass  And we'd play 20 questions  And see if we could guess  And when we guessed  He went  Oh  And he reached in  Pulled it out of his asshole  And showed us if we were right  And then without fail  He put it in his mouth  Every time  And you know what I love  Yeah  R2-D2  And he put it in his mouth  And then usually  It would end with him  Chasing around someone  Horrified  With the thing that was up his ass  Right 
[02:52:30]  And naked  So  Yeah look at that  That's the Sopranos  Tattoo  Oh no  With the iconic  I ordered for the table  Underneath it  The Sopranos  That looks like the Sopranos  After the entire family  Was hit in front of  Spark's Steakhouse  That is  They all look like  They have bullets in their eyes  It looks like  Some brunette  Fucking Bob Gullab  Fucking the girl  From the ring  And some other 
[02:53:00]  Fucking chubby guy  On the end  Rocky Dennis  Henry Rollins  Henry Rollins  It's a terrible tattoo  I ordered for the table  That is so bad  He's gotta walk around  With that forever  For the rest of his life  And if you're on radio  It's one thing  If you're working  At the  Stair  Who does these  Tattoos  I think came in  And did  Governor Patterson  The seventh caller  Yeah  I miss that 
[02:53:30]  Fuck  One day his kids  Will be old enough  To watch daddy  Walking around the house  With no shirt on  And they'll  He'll have to explain  Yes  His sopranos  And whack bag  And lucky boy tattoos  And all that crap  I know  These commercials  Just fucking sicken me  I know  How do you  All these abs  Yeah all these doctors  60, 70 year old doctors  And my libido  This is what he's saying  Right now  And my libido  Is stronger than ever  And you're like

[02:56:30]  About the Viagra ads  And like all the stuff  That you'd find in the back  Of you know  Like men's magazines  And everything  Yeah  Because there'd always be  Some silver haired couple  And like  They're all smiles  And everything  And I'm just like  Looking at this old woman  Going  She's happy that she can  Get a hard dick in her now  Yeah  She's real pleased  That's all that they're  Really saying here  Is that like  She got a wet noodle cock  In her  For 20 years  And now her husband  Could finally get his dick  Hard again  Now his dick gets hard  With a fucking vacuum pump  Oh no  You okay James  Just  I'm sorry 
[02:57:00]  Your medical doesn't cover  The dick pump  Yeah  He's upset  He's mad  I did it wrong  And my leg stuck out  Straight  That's what  That's what kills you  About Norton  Is not only is he  That fucking funny  But he's  He's that funny  Peripherally  He's on those  Fucking phone  Texting most of the time  Oh I know  Yeah yeah  Running in and out  I don't know what he's doing  Out there  Trying to fucking get  His taxes done  And that funny  Out of the side  Of his mouth  I know  That's why Jimmy is like 
[02:57:30]  He can multitask  He can do a lot of things  He must be getting a picture  With Joan Rivers  Is that what he's doing  I have no idea  Or he's trying to get to the bottom  Or a picture with somebody else  No it looked to me like  He was in  Get picture mode  Because E-Rock  Was taking him over somewhere  Well I've only seen  Rage like that from Jimmy  When it comes to  Not getting a celebrity photo  Not getting a celebrity photo  Exactly  I've seen it  Several times in here  Where you'll just get a wave  Of just sheer hatred  And angst 
[02:58:00]  Son of a bitch  Did you fuck  Couldn't get a picture  Fuck him publicist  Fuck him  He gets like that  He gets all very angry  But he ran out there  And went down the hallway  Where guests usually  Come popping out  So I'm assuming  Maybe photograph  Maybe he wants to talk to somebody  And talk him into coming in  Do you think Joan Rivers  Is really hilarious  You know something  Doug  People have different tastes  In comedy  Comedy is very subjective  Jimmy 
[02:58:30]  Finds Joan hysterical  I was going to say  When he said that  I was going to say  That I think  She's a  And then I realized  That I only know  Joan Rivers  Recently  From  Celebrity Apprentice  And then I  I was going to say  That I thought  She was a real  Real fucking  Horrible cunt  And then I go  Oh wait  I'm going to look like  A complete dildo  Because I  I'm saying this  Based on Celebrity Apprentice  Oh  Oh Jimmy's talking  With somebody 
[02:59:00]  Oh it's a meeting  In the hallway  The arms are going out too  Here it is  His hands are at his side  And then he'll turn  His palms  Out  Forward  And spread his arms  Out a little  He's talking  And doing that  Like huh  Why  There's something  Going on  Let me hear  Alright  Our  Our resident  Rat  Sam  We're going to send  Our resident  Rat  Sam  Is going to go out  And try to see  What is being said  Anything  Well 
[02:59:30]  Because  I was just talking to Liam  And we might be able  To get it done  He's going to try  To make it happen  I think they should  Make it happen  But because we  Passed on the one guy  It wasn't for any  Awful reasons  Rampage happens to be  In town  And we wanted Rampage  Because we have  Had him in many times  Of course  Rampage Jackson  Jackson I'm assuming  Yeah  And it's  For the A team  Yes  They're doing the  Publicity tour  Yes  And we had said 
[03:00:00]  No to the one guy  Because the movie people  Wouldn't give us Rampage  We didn't know why  They wouldn't give us Rampage  And they wouldn't just say  Look he's not going to be in town  So we were kind of annoyed  So we said  Well we don't know the other guy  So now Rampage is in town  So I'm like  Alright well let us  And I'm like  Well you guys said no  It's like  I get that we said no  But this is why  We were told something different  It's like  It's not to knock  The other shows  Alright but the reality is  We have a much  Larger audience  Yeah  Than probably  Most of them put together  And again it's not a knock  On the other shows 
[03:00:30]  But it's a male demo  What are you doing  What's the game  Why are they playing  This game though  I said look  Is this publicist  You're dealing with  No no not the publicist  It's our people  And I said well why don't you  Just do the right thing by us  By this show  And again they're going to try to  I understand they have other shows  That have to be considered  But it's like  I guess when you're just being lumped in  As one of the shows in a row  On the platform  And not being held out  As a special show  It's like alright  Well what's the motivation then  To behave  And again  I know they're going to try to make it work 
[03:01:00]  Maybe they'll be able to  We shouldn't have to  Be obligated to take one person  To get another person  And if it changes  It just shouldn't work that way  And if it changes  And if somebody  The guy who we originally asked for  Shows up  Then the word should be  Alright  To the publicist  Look  This is what happened  But it's better for you guys  We'll tell this other show  It's like  If you're going to look at us all  As  And again I know I'm being a dick  But I think that we should  Get a little bit of a fucking priority  Yeah 
[03:01:30]  Not fuck the other shows  But I think that  If you're going to give everybody  20 minutes  You could wedge them in here  And give everybody  16 minutes  And make it work  Right  You know I think you could  Make it work that way  Yeah  But  Fuck those other shows  Oh damn  Sorry  Oh Doug Stanhope  Had to say that  Notice I said your name  So no one gets confused  But no you know what I'm saying  It's like  Not what I'm saying  I know what you're saying  Yeah  Come on  It is  It's silly  I don't know why we have to  Be auditioned  With another guest  In order to get 
[03:02:00]  The other guest  I don't even think anybody  Did it on purpose  I think that he just  Happened to be here  But I think that  This is the company here  Going well  You guys said no  And it's like  So we're kind of being  If you guys get a guest  On your own  That's like  Really high dollar  You know  High profile  Do you like  Parade them around  The other shows  That they're not  Going to be doing  No we don't care  I would love to just  Have them look at all the ones  With our fucking name  On the thing  And go  We're doing this show  And not you  Haha not you  But no  Just give them a tour around 
[03:02:30]  Oh let me show you  The facility  This is Ron and Fez  Haha  I get fucking Bill Clinton  Bill Clinton  Or whoever  That would be  That would be a good one  That is really  Bad  Stupid  Idiotic  Give me some clues  I'm not even mad about it  I'm just kind of  Speechless about it  But Liam's going to try  I know he's a good dude  He's going to try  And make it work  But come on  We'll see what happens  We'll see  I know  I don't like the  I don't like the little  Bullshitty things 
[03:03:00]  That go on like that  Because we should get him  We've been very  You know  We've been  Very good sports  As far as MMA goes  So I said  Why can't we have  Rampage  This would be the  Perfect demographic  Of course it would be  So it's like  The publicist  They're like  Well they want  Rampage with them  And I'm like  Well they want to  Sell tickets to the movie  Yeah  Well then why wouldn't  You have them come in here  Where this is the audience  They're going for  Yeah  Angry white men  A team sucks  But I mean  You know what I'm saying  That's who we talk to  Where are they going 
[03:03:30]  Fucking out cue  Yes  Is Rampage going to out cue  Yeah that's  That's the gay channel  No  Yeah  Well I guess  Yeah  UFC that makes sense  Is it  Is it called the gay team  Or the A team  Because I  Maybe I was confused  A team  Alright sorry  I thought maybe  Because that would be  A whole other movie  With B.A. Barakas  I'm sure  It could be big ass  Because his ass  Would be big  If that movie  Isn't out  Now  It probably will be 
[03:04:00]  Within three weeks  Yeah  Obvious gay porn knockoff  Oh oh  The gay team  Oh it is  It has to be  Wait  The gay team  Of course it is  The porno  The gay team  There it is  There it is  Big summer movies  Oh no  Yeah  You might want to  Take that down  In case we do  Get them  And the picture  Doesn't even try  To spoof it  They are not even 
[03:04:30]  Trying  Three  At least get a black  Costa Rican kids  In bathing suits  I pity the fool  Gotta take my cock  The gay team  I don't know  I don't  I don't see it  Happening by the way  What  I don't think  It will happen  Call me negative  Nelly  That's what they  Call me at home  What the fuck  Were we just  Talking about anyway  The penis pump  Joan Rivers  Oh right right  Yeah  And then Joan Rivers  We talked about her 
[03:05:00]  A little bit  We didn't share  Your  Feelings on that  Joan Rivers thing  Jimmy's going after  Investigative journalism  I know  More investigative journalism  Back to the penis pump  Because I can't get enough  Of this fucking  Rod pump  Is how well  Postivac works  Worked the first time around  I'm going  Wow  It really works  Now you and the one you love 
[03:05:30]  Can enjoy complete sexual pleasure  And satisfaction  Anytime  With no pills  No doctor visits  No  Postivac is a clinically proven  Vacuum therapy system  Not a pill  You'll experience results  In less than four minutes  Not hours  And there are no harmful side effects  Vacuum therapy is so safe  Complete degradation  Now the only erectile treatment  Covered by Medicare Part B  Medicare Part B  All it does is suck blood  Into your dick  Right  Can't your wife do that 
[03:06:00]  Yeah  Exactly  You're with somebody  And if it's not  Going to be there  Naturally  It's going to  Fucking  As soon as the vacuum's gone  That's going to start to deflate  Yeah  Just get it pumped up  Like a leaky tire  And try to jam it in her  Before it  All the air rushes back out  Yeah  Cause isn't it  It's not even just so much  The blood just going in  It's got to stay in there  Yeah  There's like some kind of  Cheap valve or something  Tie it off with a garbage twist tie 
[03:06:30]  A twisty  Or a fucking rubber band  Yeah  Or something  And then shove it in the old  Honey give me your scrunchie  I need to keep some blood  In my cock  Yeah  Cause it would just deflate  And what couples  Are sitting there using this  Like the wife will be happy  Knowing that she's got to  Sit there and pump  His fucking dick  Like a basketball  Yeah  That's something you do  While you're calling whores  On crank  In your seedy roadside motel  Rotary dial 
[03:07:00]  And  God damn  Waiting for the whore  And you get to  Pump on max  Yeah  You gotta pump it up  Right till she comes to the door  And then hope it doesn't go away  Oh it looks like a hickey  You've blown out  So many blood vessels  Waiting and waiting  She said half an hour  It's been like 90 minutes  Holy shit  What happens if  Like what if it goes away  In the middle  Like you gotta pull out  And then re-pump  Re-pump  Yeah  How awkward is that gonna be  Oh man  Over-pump it  Blow out all the veins 
[03:07:30]  You look like a drunkard's nose  Your dick  Your dick looks like W.C. Fields  Ah yes  Look at my cock  Thank God he's back  Yes  Jimmy we weren't  Me and Doug were talking  We weren't  Sharing  Your  Like  Of Joan Rivers  Um  Okay  It's just um  It's just a thing  Ah 
[03:08:00]  But again  I uh  I based my uh  Completely on  Celebrity Apprentice  Which is my own fault  Cause I  I watched it  Cause Dice Clay was on it  And then I got hooked  And he got thrown off  On the first episode  And then I got  Addicted to it  Yeah  Oh another conference  But yeah  She was a  Horrible  Horrible person  It's a conference  It's a conference  Jimmy's having a conference  They're talking  I love  I love the radio show stops 
[03:08:30]  Cause somebody  Pops in  But it's like  Who is that  It's a mystery  What do you know  You gotta catch me up  On all this shit  I haven't had  I haven't said like  Three words in the last hour  Cause I have no idea  About the pie face kid  From the Ron and Fez show  I don't have any  Fucking thing to chime in  Oh what's that  Oh  Dr. Black  Oh yes  Of course we do  Hang on  I love Dr. Steve  Dr. Steve  Hello  Paging Dr. Steve  How are you Dr. Steve 
[03:09:00]  I'm well  How are you  Dr. Steve  I still use you  As an excuse  Of why  I can't exercise  Cause of my  Umbilical hernia  You said it would  Make it more  Profound  If I were to  Is that Doug  Yeah it's Doug  Hey man  How are you sir  Feel free to  Use me to  Further  I say baby  I'd love to  But Dr. Steve  Told me about  Exercise  He didn't say it  Like that  He said it's a  Bad thing  Exercise  Dr. Steve  What's the word 
[03:09:30]  On the street  About the pump  For your meat  The vacuum therapy  Yes  You know  Those things  Have been out  For a long  Long time  And Medicare  Actually pays for  Yes we heard  About that  Now  Doug brought up  An interesting  Point  If you're using  The penis pump  It's in essence  Just sucking  Blood into  Your dick  When you take  It off  Wouldn't your  Member  I like to say  Member  Your member  Yes I'm sorry  Member  Is that the guy 
[03:10:00]  You're missing  A key point  In the penis pump  And here's how it works  Basically  The finger in the ass  Ah yes  That's what it is  You take this tube  And it's  Relatively air tight  At the base  Of the schlong  And you  Then you can get  Two versions  You can get  The manual pump  Which is the  Inexpensive one  And the motorized pump  And what it does  Is it evacuates  The air from the  From the tube  And that creates 
[03:10:30]  A negative pressure  Which draws blood  Into the  It sucks your dick  Right  Now is it  Is it true  That they're gonna  BP is gonna  Start using this  To try to collect  The oil  From the  Because  I just heard that  Sounds like  A good idea  Giant penis pump  So yes  We understand  How it  Now at the end  Of the tube though  Is a cock ring  And so when you're  When you get this  Massive purple erection  To your liking  You slip off 
[03:11:00]  The cock ring  And then pull the  The pump off  And then it maintains  This erection  After  So I was right  Yeah you gotta  Twist tie that down  Twist tie a scrunchie  The cock ring  The cock ring  Oh okay  Wow  There are a bunch  Of studies out there  On cock rings  That show that  Only about 20%  Of people get  A good erection  With one of those  But you're gonna get  Leakage I guess  Right  Well you do  But when you  Use the pump  In conjunction  With the cock ring  Then it goes up  To about 50% 
[03:11:30]  And for guys  Who have cardiac  Conditions  Who are taking  Nitroglycerin  They can't take  Viagra  So for them  This is a  Non-pharmacologic  When I take  Viagra  I get really  Violent acid reflux  Is there a reason  For that?  Drinking cum?  Yeah exactly  Cause you're fucking  You're like a little fish  You're shooting it  Off the ceiling  And guppy catching it  That could be it  Yeah there's  To my knowledge  I have to get back  To you on that one  There are a lot 
[03:12:00]  Of side effects  That you can get  The blue vision  You can get  Yeah I've never had  Any of the ones  That they warn you about  But I get  Acid creeping up  My throat violently  Sounds horrible  I haven't heard  That association  With that  And I'm racking  My brain  To think of a reason  Why that  I've been prone  To hiatal hernia  So I don't know  If that would  Have anything to do  You know  This Viagra  Relaxes  The muscles  Around blood vessels  And so they dilate 
[03:12:30]  And you may be getting  There may be  Some association  With relaxation  Of that sphincter  That you have  At the end  Of your esophagus  That's relaxing  Dr. Steve  I'll look into that  I'll get back to you  On that  You got my email  Let me ask you this  With the penis pump  And the cock ring  And then normal erections  What is it  That holds the blood  In one's cock  Okay  Here's how it works 
[03:13:00]  There are  Little arteries  That come into the penis  And then there are  Larger veins  That come out  Of the penis  Now the way  That you can  Get blood  To stay in  A member like that  Is to either  Increase the blood flow  In or decrease  The blood flow out  And that's how  The cock ring works  Is by decreasing  The blood flow out  Now what's inside  The penis  Are these big  Spongy things  Called corpora cavernosa 
[03:13:30]  And they  I thought it was candy  They're like sponges  And surrounding these sponges  Is a very inelastic coating  Okay  So what you get  Is you get a blood filled sponge  Surrounded by a coating  That won't expand  So it's not like a balloon  You don't get this big  Balloon-y looking  Right  You get a 
[03:14:00]  A very rigid  Fluid filled  Hydrodynamic  Organ  Wow  And that's how it works  Now is there  Is there some kind of  Shut off valve  For the blood  Or is it just that  There's more blood  Pumping in  Than is pumping out  On a normal penis  That's working  You get a little bit of both  You get increased blood flow  In and decreased blood flow  Out  And there is  Yeah there are shut off valves  They're just 
[03:14:30]  Muscles that surround  The vessels  That can either relax  And let more blood in  Or they can contract  And keep blood from going out  Wow  And decrease the blood flow  You are quite the  Cock expert sir  That is wonderful  Who knew  And you know  Viagra works by  Increasing nitric oxide  In the blood stream  And that's a real  Potent dilator  Of the vessels  That feed the penis  Alright so it really  Pumps the blood  In there then 
[03:15:00]  I'm never going to  Look at my dick jokes  The same  No now you know  The background  To the dick joke  By the way  Just to interrupt  If I could  Lewis Black is here  So we're going to  Bring Lewis in  And put him where Sam is  Yes absolutely  If we happen to get  Those guys in  That would be great  But at least we have  Lewis here  There's no reason  For Lewis to not be in here  Yes they'll be here  Okay  They're coming  Oh they think so  From what I heard  Yeah we'll have him  10, 15, 10, 25  Yeah Liam says  He's working on  Okay yeah I know  Liam's trying to  Make it work  There's just a lot  Of shit to do  Okay sorry Dr. Steve 
[03:15:30]  Oh no no no  Back to love line  Yes  Do you use Cialis?  Cialis is better than I ever  I've used them both  But they both give me  The horrible  Yeah  Maybe they do it to me too  Take a Tums  It's worth it  Yeah no I've taken  Shit loads  Shit loads  You could try Levitra  Just to see if it's any different  It has a little bit  I haven't tried that  It's a little bit  Gentler  Activity  It's a little shorter  But it still works  And that 
[03:16:00]  You know that might be  Better for you  Isn't that the commercial?  The other thing you could do  If you want to avoid  The reflux  Is just do the  Penis injections  With Alprostadil  You know that's a  That sounds like a nightmare  Why would you  You know at that point  Just write off sex  For the rest of your life  If you need needles  In your dick  It just shows  How far guys will go  To have sex  You know that's  We're just programmed  That way  If everything else fails  You take an injection  And inject it in the  Base of your dick  Isn't that what the 
[03:16:30]  Point stars use?  No they use something  Called Caberjet  Which is very dangerous  Yeah?  What's that?  It makes your cock hard  With a needle  It's not good  Yeah that's  That's what he's  Talking about  Yeah  It's a hormone  Called Alprostadil  And they finally figured  Out a way that they  Can do it without  Injections  You actually use  A little  Inserter  That inserts a pellet  Into your ear  Into your ear  Like loading a Pez dispenser  Yeah it's just like that  It's just like that 
[03:17:00]  All right  I guess  Yeah it's  Well that's something  Dr. Steve  Always  Always  Very educational  Very professional  That's why we like  Having Dr. Steve on  For our medical questions  Thank you so much  All new weird medicine shows  The next two Saturdays too  All right  Look forward to that people  Thank you  I'd like to check it out  But I'll be at the  Highline Ballroom on Saturday  At 8 o'clock  As well as Friday  Cool  Thank you sir  You can hear by that laugh  Take care buddy

[03:19:00]  I can't feel my dick  Anyway  I've done so much  MDMA  And sure  Pierce the thing  There roll a derby girl  Yeah that might work  Yeah I  And I think  With the lead thing  As far as  I think China  Becoming like a  Kind of powerhouse  These days  With their exports  Everything they make  Is lead  Everything they make  Is lead  Well they don't care  No  They got a billion people  What do they care

[03:20:00]  And then they go  No government  Well that's the thing  No government  Nobody's going to  Check it out  Then it's called  Tubski-Shitski  Yeah  If you're going to  Let the Chinese  But now the Chinese  Are actually raising  Their wages  It's going to get  Really good  Oh they are  Yeah  But that was like  The bastion of cheap labor  Not anymore  Aww  They want stuff  Are they going to  Start striking  And doing things like that  Oh I hope so  Maybe  You know something  Maybe someday  They'll have to export  Their jobs  To the United States 
[03:20:30]  To get cheap labor  We're ten minutes away  Are we ten minutes  Away from that  Oh you know  We're sitting there  In sweatshops  Making things  With Japanese  And Chinese writing  On shirts  Well we've  You know  If we lose  That entire coast  Down there  If we lose  The Gulf  If we lose the Gulf  Then you can just  Set up warehouses  Let's start making shit  We're fantasizing  About flaming hurricanes  As a hurricane  Forms  And picks up the oil  And atomizes it  And someone lights

[03:23:00]  There's a rhythm to this  And I can  You know  It's the third book I've written  And I can do  And then still  No matter what you do  Eventually  You get to the point of  I mean  The level that you hate yourself  Is so beyond belief  Now you're immobile  And you're just staring at your crap  Wondering why you're doing this  And it just goes  I'm just trying to imagine you typing  With those hands  Oh I know  Yeah  Flipping around  Oh boy that happens  Cartoonish  Oh yeah  No it gets pretty  And I had two  Now I have  I had two  Computers 
[03:23:30]  That  Because I got rid of  One was  One was going into the shitter  But it was like  I'd go back and forth  Between the computer  And I would be sitting there  Typing on one board  And  And  And  And  And not  It wasn't coming onto the computer  I thought I was typing it into  It was stuff like that  Oh yeah  I'm really good at this stuff  I've done that  Yeah  I'm really good at it  Two computers  One computer  One that he types on  And the other one with the hard drive  That can be thrown out immediately  If the FBI shows up  Both the disposable hard drive 
[03:24:00]  So  Alright  So you got a  Third book for me was Hard Man  Because I have not  Like I started  And I have not been able to get through  Like I just had not been able to just  You know how you have that click  Where all of a sudden you're motivated  And you're  And it's happening  And you're doing it  I can't get to that point  Doug let the authors talk  Okay  Don't chime in  Yeah  No the click  I mean  I just  They said to me  You want to write a Christmas book  I said no  And then when I  You know  It's just a  You know the click comes  When you sit around long enough  When you've  When you've masturbated  To the point 
[03:24:30]  Where you just  You know there's nothing left  And then it comes  Eventually you push yourself into it  You'll get there  What is the Christmas book  Based around  I mean just Christmas  It's basically  Being alone on Christmas  Being a Jew on Christmas  Watching people lead  These really great lives  Where your life is shit  While you're alone  You go to visit families  They're all really happy  You realize you're leaving  Nothing behind  Except your own selfish shit  That you did during your life  And so that's  Basically that's what  The book's about  Basically I said 
[03:25:00]  It's a book about being  Single  Disguised as a Christmas book  Now we were talking about this earlier  Being single  And  As opposed to being in a relationship  And  Being single  Do you enjoy your time alone  Or do you  Were you in relationships  Where you had extended periods  Of time with a girl  And  No I had long  I mean until  A lot of long termers  Until I really kind of  Went on the road  Yeah  I was  This is  I went on the road 
[03:25:30]  And  And that was really  When I went  You know I  I don't have to live  With anybody anymore  Oh so it was kind of good  You liked it  Here's what I liked  I was  Literally lying in a hotel room  In some shit ass  You know  Town  And playing some shit ass club  You know  Probably the third or fourth week  Out on the road  And I'd been living with this woman  Who'd been driving me  Completely insane  And I was lying there  And I went  What's that sound  I went  Oh  It's silence  Oh  Oh my god  Oh  It's gonna be around 
[03:26:00]  For the all  I'm gonna get up  And nobody's gonna say  You know  Start nagging at me  This is like heaven  It's refreshing  So it was heaven  If we have  If we have to interrupt you  For a moment  We have  If we have  We're probably gonna get  A couple of extra people  That are coming in  Sure  For ten minutes  I apologize  Don't worry  I have no light  Don't you worry  Okay  Cause you're here  Don't you worry  Now it's like  Liam I think  We'll make it work  It looks like  Charlto Copley  And Rampage  Will come in for a few minutes  They're promoting  The A-team  The A-team 
[03:26:30]  Charlto Copley  By the way  Was hysterical  In District 9  Who did he play in District 9  He was the main guy  He was the guy  Oh wow  He was the main guy  And  Oh  Like  That character  The more I watched that movie  I think I've watched it three times  I really like it  The first time I watched it  I was like  Okay whatever  Are they going for a message thing here  And then I realized  This movie is hysterically funny  It's terrific  That guy is just  Okay  Come here sweet  Come here sweet  And the thing throws  A can at his head  And he gets all mad at it 
[03:27:00]  Oh that guy was tremendous  He's hysterical  They're coming  Oh they're coming down now  Yeah  You guys can see  We got the very important  The very important celebrity couch  Yes  Not the comic chairs  Here they are  Gentlemen  Gentlemen  How are you?  Thanks for coming  Also hi  Nice to meet you  Hi  Hi  Pleasure  Nice to meet you  Yeah  We got a full house  Yeah  We got a full house  But guess what  I get punched for a living  You don't  What's that?  I get punched for a living 
[03:27:30]  You don't  So your brain  Probably better than mine  You know what I'm saying?  Nah I wouldn't go  Don't  Yeah let's start bullshit  I've been drunk every night  For 20 years  So I kind of know the feeling  Yeah  You've been drunk every night  For 20 years?  Yeah  It's kind of like  Getting punched in the head  Every day  What was you drinking?  What were you drinking last night?  Last night  Well I was flying  I was drinking vodka  Grapefruits mostly  You were flying?  Yeah  You were flying  I was just going to say  Like were you drinking and flying  That's not good  Yeah you do not say that 
[03:28:00]  In front of Shouto  About drinking and flying  Because Shouto  He's a flyer himself  And he takes it very seriously  That's about the only  That's about the only time  No he's not even serious  When he do that  But that's when he's the most sane  Yeah  Do you have a pilot's license  For real?  Dude  I don't  And I'm so  I so wish that I could fly  I'm actually  If we make a sequel  I'm seriously going to try  And get Fox to like  Give me the real  Pilot training  So you guys  The A-Team  Is obviously coming out  When is it coming out?  11th of June 
[03:28:30]  Okay  It comes out June 11th  Yeah  And Rampage  This is your first  Bit of acting work  Or have you done anything before?  No  I don't  You know  Don't  Don't bring it up  Shouto  Let me bring it up  Okay  But I've actually  I've done other movies  I've done like  Sorry  No no no  Please go  Say the name  I love it  That's not the only movie I've done  No no I know  I know  I'm not going to bring up that movie  And it's a good movie  It's just an unfortunate name  That's all I'm saying  I hate that you guys asked me this question  Because Shouto won't let me live it down  I'm not going to bring up that movie 
[03:29:00]  I didn't raise it  He raised it  But I've done other movies  That's not the only movie I've done before  Okay  I'm just saying  What's the name of that movie?  What movie?  The other one you did  The other movie  I've done  Bradley Cooper  Ladies and gentlemen  Bradley Cooper  You know we have to  In  Just get it done  In  I've done a horror movie  With Bradley Cooper before  And the name of the movie  Was Midnight Meat Train  Midnight Meat Train  Midnight Meat Train  Ladies and gentlemen  That's a Clyde Barter movie  What's wrong with that?  It doesn't sound gay at all  That's a great name for a film  Midnight Meat Train 
[03:29:30]  I know  I never thought  I never thought it sounded gay  I just thought it sounded like a porno  Or something  And I didn't want to do the movie  But I was like  Who am I to not do a movie  Because of the name  I'm not like  Established celebrity  And it's probably a good movie  It was a great flick  I've already seen it a few times  It's a good film  But  Shout out to me  Won't let me live it down  Because I did a film  Called Midnight Meat Train  Yeah  Look  Shout out to me  Shout out to me  Shout out to me  Shout out to me  Shout out to me  And I'm saying  He's cool sometimes  But  If you guys just really  Get to know him  He really annoys you  Really? 
[03:30:00]  Like  When you asked me that question  I was like  Oh my goodness  I know  Shout out to me  We're supposed to have  Like a chemistry  And then he just starts  With a snapping thing  You know  I've just been trying to  Reach out to him  The whole time  On the film  You know  Just be  Show him love  Show him support  No  Shout out to me  Show him love  Show him support  It's like  When we first met  You know what I'm saying  We was like  Both  Obviously A-Team fans  And I thought  I was the biggest A-Team fan  Which I was cool  If somebody was a bigger  A-Team fan than me  But  Shout out to me  Trumped me  When he told me  He had the Mr. T  Birthday cake 
[03:30:30]  And I'm like  I ain't never had no  Mr. T birthday cake  Then he said  Not only that  I was an A-Team gang  You know what I'm saying  I did  I had an A-Team gang  At school  Wow  I was 10 years old  I was playing A-Team  I started the gang  And then this rival gang  Started  They want to be A-Team  In the class  So we challenged them  And we said  Okay stakes are  Whoever loses  Agrees to walk away  Not be the A-Team  We went down to the field  We had a fight  We won  Thankfully  Because it would be  A really bad story  If we lost  I love it when a plan  Comes together 
[03:31:00]  But look  This is him  I had heard this  The whole time on set  About his A-Team game  And he would tell me stories  About how  What his A-Team game did  And I don't think  It's so much of him  Telling me the stories  And reliving it  I think it was more of him  Bragging to me  That he had an A-Team gang  Not quite a blood  Or a crip though  A-Team gang  I don't think that's going to be  Showed on gangland  It's pretty serious there  It's you know  Yeah yeah  I've heard  I've heard  You know what 
[03:31:30]  Really  I didn't think of that  I felt bad  Because I used to get  Approached by gangs  Because as a kid  I've always been a fighter  I've always been a good fighter  And like  There's one gang called  GD  I used to call them  Glazed Donuts  But that's another  You know what I'm saying  But they were like  Except for gangster disciples  That doesn't sound tough  Oh okay  I call them Glazed Donuts  That's the worst thing  You can call them  And they used to always  Jump me  Because they wanted me to  They used to try to fight me  They used to always  Want me to be in a gang  They would jump me  And everything  And I was totally  Against gangs my whole life  Just because  My upbringing  And the person  Who kind of took me  In up under his wing 
[03:32:00]  You know what I'm saying  He wasn't a real good guy  But he wasn't a real bad guy  Either  He just told me  Gangs was for cows  And stuff like that  And like those type of gangs  But anyway  I wish there was  An A-Team gang  When I was a kid  I would have joined  An A-Team gang  That's why I'm so jealous  You know  He keep rubbing in  Because like an A-Team gang  Can go and  You're in the movie though  I know I'm in the movie  But they can go  And people from other games  And I'm sure  He does a great job  Of BA  Unbelievable  Yeah  But if there are going to be  Gangs on the street  Why not have an A-Team gang  You know what I'm saying  You can help people  Instead of go and do bad 
[03:32:30]  Why not be an A-Team gang  Who wants to help people  We had a Cheers gang  That was Carla  Cheers gang  You actually look like  You're nursing  That hangover right now  Yes sir  Yes sir  Charlton I got to ask you  A question about  District 9  Was that  When the movie starts  Was the spaceship real  Is what he wants to help  When the movie starts  Your character  Is very funny  Yeah  And it wasn't until  The second or third time  I watched the movie  That I realized  How god damn funny  That character is  I'm glad 
[03:33:00]  I'm glad you find it funny  Because  I did as well  Was it supposed to be  Played that way  Or was that  Kind of written like that  Or did you just  Play it that way  Because  It's like  This guy is tragic  And hysterically funny  Well it was actually  It was actually  Going to be more  Even more comedy  Throughout  Originally  Like when Peter Jackson  Saw what I originally did  In the little  Sort of accidental test  That I had done  I was meant to produce  That film  But that's another  Whole story  So when he saw that  Peter was actually  Calling it like a  Borat with aliens 
[03:33:30]  God damn that's great  And we made it  We made it though  I mean I think  Neil's natural thing  Of what he wanted to do  Was  Although he's like  One of the funniest guys  I've ever met in my life  He naturally  Kind of gravitated  Towards the soulful  Sci-fi kind of element  So he actually  Toned down  Some of the humor  That we shot  We shot a lot of  Funny stuff in the beginning  And I also felt  Once I had that  Prosthetic on me  I just felt like  The guy wouldn't be as  He would be a more  Dramatic change  Yeah because it was 
[03:34:00]  A drastic change  From the goofy  Kind of guy  My favorite scene  And I hate just  Bringing it up  Because there's no  Reason to  Except to say  I loved it  When the little  The little creature  And you're going  He's got me a sweet  Sweet  And it throws that  Thing at your head  And you just  It's the sweetie man  Coming  It's the sweetie man  Coming  And it  It throws the thing  At your head  And you just  Curse at it  Fucking hysterical  I just thought  You did such a  Great job with that  Movie  And like I said  I watched it  Three times 
[03:34:30]  And I'd watch it again  It's hysterical  It's a movie that  You don't expect to be  As deep or as good  As it is  You think it's going to be  Like a sci-fi alien movie  And it really is about  This guy  Trying to get back  With his wife  It's like a real storyline  Which you never would have  A few times  You really do have to watch it  A couple of times  To pick up on  The fact that it is  Kind of a deeper story  Than most people  And that's why  I became a fan of  Shalto when he did  This nine  But you guys should see  The job he did  With Murdoch  Yeah  I can honestly say  Selfishly 
[03:35:00]  I'm a big fan  Of A-Team  And that's all that  Matters to me  Is that the movie  Turns out good  Where the old fans  Can be like proud  And we can get new fans  So I'm taking myself  Out of there  Even though  Back in the day  B.A. stood out  The most of everybody  I don't care nothing  About that  What I care about  Is the movie  Is really good  And Murdoch  Was the man  And B.A. Murdoch  You couldn't  Me  You couldn't like one  Without the other  They went together  Yeah  It's true  And Murdoch  Stood out in this film 
[03:35:30]  He stood out the most  In this film  And he was  The closest to the  Original Murdoch ever  And I'm so happy  And I was so happy  When I saw the film  I couldn't believe it  Have you heard from  Mr. T at all  Or anything  Is he angry  We trying  Both of us  Both of us  Are like huge  Mr. T fans  And I got to meet  Dwight Schultz  Who played my  You know  Who invented Murdoch  Really  Cause he  That character  Was not written like that  I learned  Through the process  And  It's  Yeah  It's sad 
[03:36:00]  I mean  The two of us  Were like  We literally  Quinton is such a big fan  He's actually getting  An A-team  He's trumping me now  For the cake  He is buying  An A-team van  So we're gonna  Take the van  We figured we're gonna  Take the van  We're gonna go  And camp outside  Mr. T's house  Actually  I'm getting the van  For free  The people who did  My air ride  On my truck  You're getting it  For free  They are making  My A-team van  For free  Right now  I gotta do a little  Deal with them  But a  Kelderman air ride  You know what they do  They put the air  Suspension on your  I got a monster truck 
[03:36:30]  And when I drive  Next to another monster truck  If it's a little bit  Taller than mine  I go  I don't like people  I don't like people  Trumping me  And Chateau always  Trump me  So I don't like that  I hate that  And one of those  Old A-team vans  That would look really cool  He's literally getting  The actual end  And you could put  A sticker on the back  That says  If this van is a rockin'  I'm beating the shit  Out of someone inside  Damn  That's what I'm gonna get  Are you gonna fight again  Or are you like  The acting is just like  A much easier lifestyle  I just fought  A couple  I just got my ass whooped  The other day  You know what I'm saying  I like fighting 
[03:37:00]  I'm a fighter  I've been a fighter  My whole life  And I know  You did not get your ass whooped  You didn't get your ass whooped  I thought you had him  I don't wanna harp on this  But I just for the record  Don't wanna say that  I haven't seen  I haven't seen the fight  So I just felt like  I didn't do it  I didn't do  You know  Up to my  You got your ass held  For a significant length of time  I mean  You know  Well  Honestly  I thought the guy  Was gonna come and  Bang with me  Anymore  Cause he talked so much crap  And when he  When he hit me  I didn't even see  The first one  When he hit me  And he like  Dazed me 
[03:37:30]  And made me fall  I'm like  Yeah I'm in a fight  Now let's do it  And he just  He just wrestled me  The whole time  So that's another story  And that's another story  But yeah  I'm gonna keep fighting  So you wanna do both  You wanna keep acting  Keep fighting  I wanna try to do both  Why not try  You must see this guy act man  It was just  There was a lot of people  Saying like  Oh what is he gonna do  With this character  And is he gonna  You know  Live up to it  Etc  And I  It was the thing about him  On set  And Liam was saying this  And Bradley was saying this  That he's just got a genuineness  That comes across  You know  And what I liked  With what he did  With Mr. T  Obviously the old Mr. T 
[03:38:00]  Was incredible  He was his own thing  And the whole role  Was written for him  You know  So what I think  That Quentin did so amazingly  Was he brought like  He brought like  A heart  And a warmth  And a charisma  To this character  You know  Which you need  In order  For a modern audience  He can't just be  Flat out bad  The whole time  And just boom boom boom  In your face  It would be boring to watch  You know  So he brought  He brought some layers  Into this B.A. character  But stayed true  To the original  Obviously when I hit you  You're gonna feel it  Type of thing  Which was awesome  We have to 
[03:38:30]  They're telling us  We have to wrap you guys  Because they did us a favor  By bringing you guys in  Because it was a mix up schedule  You want to wrap us with what?  Whatever you want  Nothing  Believe me  Do people die in this  By the way?

[03:46:30]  And on the bottom  They're going to scroll  What's on TV  Yeah and some weather  There's just occasionally  You know  Oh it's going to be hot  Later  Alright well that's  Just plain silly  Do your read  Do your read  It's good  Okay alright  And directly following  We would have been done  Bez would have wrapped  This up by now  Believe me  I've heard the way  He plows right through  Your bullshit  Yeah  Right through it  It's like he doesn't  Even fucking hear me  No  Whatever  Everything's okay  So following  Curb Your Enthusiasm  On TV Guide Network  He said the wrong name 
[03:47:00]  Oh shit  Oh shit  And the weird thing  Is he's in the office  Hearing this right now  And crying  They're laughing at me  Not with me  Seriously  Be a pro  Directly following  Curb Your Enthusiasm  On the TV Guide Network  Is the all new  Curb The Discussion  Oh yeah  See now this is  The extra thing  It's hosted by  Susie Essman 
[03:47:30]  She's brilliant  Who we love  The show features  Big stars  Media pundits  And more in a  No holds barred debate  About the issues  Of each episode  Okay now I'm in  Now I'm definitely in  Now it's giving you  Something that HBO  Didn't give you  Right  An interactive  Kind of  Q&A  Yes Lewis  I mean I love  Susie  And I love  Curb  But that's  Psychotic  You don't like  The idea of  A discussion  About the show  You know  That's like  It's Sunday school  Okay  Here's the story 
[03:48:00]  Of what happened  And now let's  Have a discussion  Of the ethics  Are you  Shitting me  Did you agree  With Larry David  When he went  Into the neighbor's house  And used that  Bad language  Yes I mean really  You've got somebody  Let's discuss  Let's go to  Michael Moore  Who's going to  Tell us about  That last episode  I mean it's  Fictional characters  They're fiction  It's fiction  That's fake  Oh I thought  That it was really  I thought it was  The Truman Show  Not everybody can  Figure out TV  So this gives them  The opportunity  On the TV Guide channel 
[03:48:30]  Yeah on the TV Guide channel  Yeah which will have  All that stuff on  My god  And all the stuff  That you need to read about  It'll be about this figure  Ah  Yeah yeah  We're just going to  Keep going of course  Watch Curb Your Enthusiasm  It's on Wednesdays and Thursdays  You know the whole thought  Of someone showing you a note  Is so that you don't  Read it out loud  That's basically  So the people at home  Don't know that you're  Getting a note  Or else he would have  Just said it  You know something  That's why Ronnie Bennington  Is the greatest in radio 
[03:49:00]  He knows things like  Don't read the note  Right  On the air  It's just silly  You're not supposed to  Wednesdays and Thursdays  At 10pm  9pm central  On the TV Guide channel  Finding the TV Guide network  In your area  Go to TV Guide  Go to TV Guide  Yeah  Dot com of course  In this day and age  But of course  Just go to the TV Guide channel  It's right there  Ronnie Bennington  I feel like  Did I take your mic Jimmy  I want to take your mic  He's honored  Stay  Okay 
[03:49:30]  He's honored  Believe me  Yes  I've been listening  Closely  With the Dave situation  Right  Eastside Dave situation  I must admit  I thought it was a work  At first  It is  It is a work  Just stay tuned  And he'll be back  Because when I heard  When I heard  The Midnight Rider music  Playing the other day  I was waiting to hear him  Hooping and hollering  And coming in  But no  I mean  He is gone  He's gone 
[03:50:00]  But he's  Sending  Well he's having his people  Send emails to Jeremy  Oh is that what he's doing  Now what is that supposed to accomplish  I don't know  At this point  Jeremy come over  Doug  Hold on  Sorry your mic was off  Oh so I just asked  When you said his people  Are emailing  Are those the people  In North Carolina  That own the chair factory  If he is ever working  In that fucking chair factory  That brilliant red headed  Douche bag  In that chair factory 
[03:50:30]  Yeah but you'd get in trouble  Sitting on a job  Or something  When you're there  Oh shit  They probably would  I will say this  Yesterday he applied  I'm not even fucking  Making this up  Costco  Costco  Costco  Where you buy the giant  Paper towel rolls  It's all there for you  It's everything you need  And that's gonna  He's gonna be happy  Doing that  I don't know  You know what  And this is nothing  Against anybody  That is involved  With Eastside Dave 
[03:51:00]  But didn't everything  Just come crashing down  Right after he decided  To get married  Well yeah  But that works that way  For everybody  That's what I mean  I think we've all been through  That's what I mean  I've done the same thing  Right  Believe me  And then having two kids  Probably not the best  Responsible idea  As far as finances go  I didn't even think about this  But you might be onto  Something right now  That's why Ronnie  I like cluing you in  On some of these things  That you might have just  Not thought about  Yeah  That a guy  Making shit for money 
[03:51:30]  Right  Probably shouldn't have  Two children  A year apart  Well you know  You could have my background  Which is an uncomfortable  Amount of abortions  Just  I don't know  I don't know  What it is  Why some people  There's no amount  Of abortion  That is less comfortable  Than actually having a child  That's true  That's true  No amount  That number doesn't exist  I have friends  That can't sleep at night  Over it  Just wondering  That's why they made Xanax  Oh good point  Like where the inside 
[03:52:00]  Of her pussy  Looks like Bud Dwyer's mouth  If they shot himself  The um  Oh god  Yeah  I  I'm kind of like  There's this void  Without  It is  We all feel it  We all feel it  Now what are your plans  For maybe  The show  Is there going to be  A replacement  Are you going to  Leave it out  And see if he  You know I was listening  To you guys  I'm thinking  You're onto something  With bringing in  An uncomfortable amount  Of black guests  Where it's just  Yes  Black gangster guests 
[03:52:30]  One or more  Yeah  Misbehaving  That was true  We had a guy  That had probably  And I don't know anything  But in my opinion  Perhaps murdered people  Oh yeah  Did you see the documentary  I did not  Just the film  The documentary is scarier  Than the film  Really  Yeah  Because New York  In the 70s  Was just  Oh that was scary  Anyway  Un-fucking-manageable  So you know  Who Frank Lucas is  And he was a scary guy  Yeah  They were all scary  Everybody who lived  In New York  In the 70s  Was frightening  Every citizen  Was fucking frightening 
[03:53:00]  Taking those big old buses  That just blew smoke  Out everywhere  Times Square  Was just a frightening place  Yeah  Now that guy  We had in here today  He was a very nice guy  But that's not the guy  You wanted to fuck with  In the 70s  And even still now  A guy like that  Will make a phone call  Oh yeah  And you know  You're dead  Cause he's still connected  I'm gonna call some  Pop hitting niggas  Right  Yeah you don't  You don't make a million dollars a day  And then all of a sudden  Just move to the suburbs  And no no one else  I hope you were quoting a movie  I hope  Yes  No actually 
[03:53:30]  Just bounced into your head  For a second  Not now  You know what  I figured  I use it at home  Right  I'm using it here  Right  I use it in my car  I use it in the bathroom  I use it in my sleep  How many guns you have now  I believe I'm up to  About 35 guns  Yeah  I just bought a .50 caliber  I saw that  Just amazing  I saw the pictures  That you had  A Barrett .50 cal  Who'd you get that from  Arnold Schwarzenegger  Just a giant movie gun  It's a giant  It looks like a fake gun 
[03:54:00]  The bullets don't look real  Cause they're just too big  To actually  It's like artillery  And when you shoot it  I said  The only way I can describe it  Is that you feel like  You have the flu  For five seconds  It shakes you up  So much  The concussion  That you're just disoriented  You feel like you have a fever  Your nose runs  And then it goes away  And you're like  I'll fire another shot  This is fantastic  Every single time  It just shakes you up  It  I don't understand  How the Marines  That are using these weapons 
[03:54:30]  In the Middle East  Can do this all day long  Without shaking their brains  Out of their ears  It hurts you  It's like you were punched  In the face  It gives you  You ever get punched in the nose  And it's a distinct feeling  That you get in your head  That's how you feel  Every time you fire this weapon  It's disturbing  But there's something  Addictive about it  Where you have to  Just keep going back  And firing more rounds  Where do you do that?  Basement?  Uniondale  Out on Long Island  Sometimes the Bronx  I got  Yeah 
[03:55:00]  That shell  The one on the left  Is the shell that I use  For that  Wow  It's insane  It's really  You can actually just  Take and stab somebody with  I was holding it  It's a weapon in itself  Just the shell  Because you can stab somebody  It's easier to use that  Than put a needle in your dick  Well that's  You just put that  Right down the shaft  And go to town  Or just put that in her vag  And watch television  While she comes  See  I did have a girl say  That she picked up the shell  And said  I would like to  Fuck myself with this 
[03:55:30]  I said  Be my guest  That's  Well  Yeah  Then I wasn't off  The lead part  Might be a problem  Might have a problem  With the  Yeah  Your vagina  After lead exposure  But  Go to town  Have fun with it  No  The  The gun's great  I have about  35 now  Pistols  And  Rifles  I need one more  Gun  To complete my collection  And then  I will be done  It is the civilian version  Of the MP5  It's what every bad guy uses 
[03:56:00]  In like  Every old 80's bad guy movie  Die hard  Yeah  Kind of things like that  The little machine  Gun pistol thing  I can't wait  To  You know  I get the chance  To go on CNN  During your Waco moments  Oh yeah  I worked with him man  You know  He was so normal  For a while  And then he just  Start to slowly lose it  It'll be really great  Anyway  Run 11 to 3  If you  Be talking about it more  Yeah  No  But you're the one guy  Nobody would say that 
[03:56:30]  People would be like  Well were you surprised  No not at all actually  I'm surprised he didn't  Kill more people sooner  We were talking earlier  About how  How embarrassing  Slash  Disturbing it is  That  At home  I like being alone  Now me and Lewis  Were just discussing this  I was in long term relationships  My entire life  And I'm finally able to  Like just be alone  At my house  Yet I have to find  Things to do  And I don't just  Want to watch TV  So I find myself  Occasionally  Down in my  Basement  Which is a bar area
