<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a heated discussion about the Yankees game, specifically manager Joe Torre’s controversial decision to remove pitcher Curt Schilling.  Opie and Anthony, along with frequent caller Jim Brewer, unleashed a torrent of highly offensive and racially charged commentary, using slurs like "gook," "slopes," and "faggot" to describe players and their actions, repeatedly punctuating their remarks with a mocking "How ya doin’?"  They also speculated on the incompetence of opposing team manager Bob Brenly. This segment included listener calls, a discussion about a bet, promotional mentions of Sam Adams beer, and problems with their Chicago broadcast due to preemptions for minor league hockey and content edits.  The segment concluded with a call from Lewis Black, who, surprisingly, discussed a topless appearance on *The Daily Show*.

Lewis Black's call continued into the next segment, this time featuring Black appearing shirtless on-air. Opie and Anthony then announced a World Series ticket giveaway at the Brooklyn Diner. An 11-year-old caller, Gary, apologized for a previous call and recounted a disturbing incident involving his neighbor and a suspicious envelope, leading to a discussion about the anthrax scare and its impact on cocaine sales. Gary also shared a cynical anecdote about his teacher's 9/11 explanation. This was followed by a call from a listener in Washington, D.C., regarding show stickers, and further speculation on anthrax mail screening. The conversation then shifted to a scathing critique of the Jenny Jones Show, focusing on exploitative segments featuring underage strippers.  This devolved into a broader, graphic discussion of exploitative content on daytime talk shows like Maury Povich and Jerry Springer, featuring offensive language and detailed descriptions of shocking segments involving children and adults with disabilities. A caller suggested using bleach to disinfect mail, prompting sarcastic responses from the hosts.  The segment returned to the World Series ticket giveaway, with calls from listeners near the Brooklyn Diner, further criticism of Jenny Jones, a caller describing a Montel Williams taping, and a heated exchange with a caller angered by the hosts’ comments on Maury Povich.

The next segment focused heavily on the Maury Povich Show, mocking its exploitation of individuals with physical differences, specifically mentioning conjoined twins and children with Progeria.  The hosts described various individuals from past sideshows and freak shows, providing graphic details of their appearances and situations.  A caller, Mike, shared a personal anecdote about encountering conjoined twins at a mall. The segment culminated in an on-air stunt for Yankee tickets, where the hosts encouraged listeners outside to get naked. Two men complied, leading to on-air commentary about their nudity, followed by a woman, Jennifer, partially disrobing and receiving compliments on her breasts before ultimately failing to win. The segment concluded with further discussion of Jennifer's breasts and prize negotiations.  The hosts also described images from a website and "Bizarre Magazine" featuring grotesque imagery.

The final segment opened with a recounting of a near-deal with a woman offering nudity for prizes, which was abandoned due to her sobriety.  The hosts then discussed the “Booble Lantern contest,” offering Aerosmith tickets, a Samsung DVD player, and $1000. Voting details were given via opiananthony.com. A caller shared a story about postal anthrax precautions.  A remote call from Steve in Boston revealed that Rocko, a host from their former station, was re-using his old “fake breakup with girlfriend” bit. Opie and Anthony criticized this bit extensively, detailing its scripted nature and contrasting it with their own style. They recounted Rocko's past behavior, including a fake wedding stunt. A listener call-in segment then asked listeners to share what they learned during the show, which resulted in humorous observations, further discussion of Rocko's antics, and more jokes about the earlier near-deal for nudity.  An advertisement for Rockaway Bedding was included.  The show ended with further jokes and banter, including an implication of a future on-air breakup for one of the hosts.

[00:00:00]  And the 3-2 pitch, swung on a drill to right field, going back Sanders, and the track,  at the wall, see ya, see ya, see ya, a home run by Derek Jeter, he cuts his fist in the air as he rounded first, he'll hit on third base, he high-fives Willie Randolph, and the entire Yankee team bobs him at home plate as he leaps onto the dish with a 4-3 Yankee win, oh, no, what a ball game, a game-winning walk-off home run by Derek Jeter.

I'm by myself on this one today.  If you're in the New York area, don't even have to give out the number because everyone's calling.  That's right.  Wonder what they want to talk about in New York today.  Fantastic.  Anywhere else, including Buffalo, New York. 
[00:04:30]  Yes, Buffalo.  Buffalo needs to be given some props today.  Our email has exploded from people in Buffalo loving the O.N.A. show, and I just want to acknowledge that today.  How you doin'?  What's that?  866-277-4WOW for Buffalo and everyone else listening to the O.N.A. show outside the New York area.  Yes.  Well, I gotta say, what a...  Oh, I got a compadre!  What a game.  Jim Brewer, what's up?  Oh, man.  Brewer. 
[00:05:00]  Dude.  How you doin', Brewer?  Yeah!  Brewer, Brewer.  Like all Mets fans?  Yeah.  I was callin' up goin', dude, this kink can pitch!  Oh, God!  He just wiped out the eighth inning.  They're done.  Yeah.  Mets, this is what we do, we get moistest a little, we're in there, you know what, Yanks  ain't even gonna be there next year, that's what sucks.  You know, and then...  Brewer, Brewer, Brewer.  Before I knew it!  Where, where are you?  Where are you?  Oh, man, I, I'm in, I'm in, I don't even know where, I'm in Connecticut. 
[00:05:30]  Ah, there you go.  How long will it take you to get down here?  I need help today.  There's no one, I walked into the office and they just started right away.  It's like, all I can, this is, it's gotta be mob related.  It's gotta be mob, it's, it's like professional, it's gotta be like professional wrestling where  Tory, they all meet before the show and say, listen, you bring in the, the chain kid, Korean,  whatever, you bring him in, the eighth inning, we mow him down, um, now, when, now, when you 
[00:06:00]  drop the ball, you gotta make it look real.  And then you've got to throw him a lollipop.  Make sure there's two outs, though.  Don't screw around.  Make sure there's two outs.  We've got to make it dramatic.  I mean, I've never seen anything like that in my life.  Yeah, that was something.  There's a lot of pissed off Koreans today, though.  He doesn't understand English, so I don't know what the hell they were telling him 
[00:06:30]  when they were walking on the mound and talking to him.  They were just shaking their head.  And he had that smile on his face as their balls were flying over his head.  He's still numb.  He doesn't know what they're talking about.  That's how it's going on in the face.  Let me tell you something.  As soon as they took out Curt Schilling, there was no doubt in my mind  that the Diamondbacks were going to lose that game.  Me neither.  The guy was throwing 98-mile-per-hour fastballs. 
[00:07:00]  Now what his coach said, I listen to Fox sounds of the game.  He said, hey, you're already a hero.  Sit down.  He goes, you're only throwing 86, he says.  Well, listen, you hit 94 an inning and a half ago.  We've got to take you out.  Well, you know, the next time Schilling throws a fastball,  it should be in the back of his head.  Wicked him to F up.  Yeah, why did they pull him?  I don't care.  Why'd they pull him?  I don't care if you're, you know, I don't care if you're a Yankee fan, whatever.  Curt Schilling is a warrior.  He's an animal.  You don't take him out.  Dude, why? 
[00:07:30]  You let him start the inning and see if he falls apart.  He got out of the inning.  He was throwing 98 miles per hour.  You don't take him out.  That's the inexperience.  You don't take him out, Dorton.  That's the inexperience.  At least one more inning.  At least one more inning.  Well, at least let him start the inning.  Exactly.  Let him get tired.  Let him go.  Let him get a run on.  You might as well, you know, it's like putting an armed guard in front of all his gold,  in front of all the gold, and no one's touched it, and the place closes at 10 at 930.  You're like, you know what?  It's cool.  We got this place covered.  Just let it go.  Go home. 
[00:08:00]  That's stupid.  Yeah, I don't know why they did.  I'm very glad they did, because that Korean, my God.  Yeah, there's a lot of people in Korea right now going,  He was just, he was smiling, and I do believe he's not sure this is the World Series.  I think, I think he's like, boy, screw up, but who, bro, who's the next team we pray?  Who next team?  Come on.  Yeah, he's a slave or something.  They just pick them up, and they throw, yeah, it's low league baseball. 
[00:08:30]  You'll love it.  We'll pay you some money.  We'll feed your family.  We'll bring the rest of your family over.  Yeah, he had no clue.  Here's something, here's something, Bob Brinley.  Why don't you play the games to win?  Man.  He's just playing defense constantly.  He's just convinced this is going seven games, so I'm going to slow everyone down around here.  I think you could agree with this.  Yeah, they should have kept Schilling in, but did Schilling look as good as he did in the first game?  Yes!  Yes!  No, no.  Hey, hey, hold on, bro. 
[00:09:00]  Listen to me.  He gave up one line and three hits.  He gave up the one to Spencer.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  There were some great catches that were made.  You know what I mean?  What?  Peter had a base hit that that goddamn guy on a pogo stick caught that goddamn.  They were hitting him a little more than they were in that first game.  I'm not even going to argue.  Nah, he doesn't.  You take him out.  He's got a 2-1 lead.  I don't give a crap how he was pitching.  Believe me.  Nobody even talked about it.  Believe me, Mikey.  I agree with you.  They should have kept him in, but I got to tell you, he wasn't pitching like he was in the first game. 
[00:09:30]  You want to discuss apples and oranges.  It doesn't matter how, if he pitched better in the first game.  He was winning the game.  He was throwing 98 miles per hour.  And Bob Brinley takes him out because Bob Brinley doesn't want to win a World Series.  I understand.  Holy ass.  They shouldn't have taken him out, but he was a little more vulnerable than he was in that first game.  It doesn't matter.  They were winning.  That's all that matters in baseball.  I'm not saying that.  That's why you have a team behind you to help you out, Anthony.  You got to let them start the inning. 
[00:10:00]  That's what makes a good team.  You got a really good pitcher.  Okay.  You know, your team needs to make some good plays to keep your boy in there.  How you doing?  How you doing?  And Mike on line seven saying they pulled Kurt to save him for game seven.  Well, how about we try to win last night's game?  I don't know if he says we and we are the Diamondbacks.  You worry about game four.  I'm in Met-Fan-Hell here at the studio.  You, I got all hopped up the day before Moises Alou maybe. 
[00:10:30]  Hold on, Brewer.  Listen to this.  So Earl walks in, who's a huge Yankee fan, and he's trying to calm me down.  He goes, so, oh, but he's screaming at Rick.  Yeah, see, people think there's a bitter song.  I was losing it in the office.  You guys should have rolled tape because that's where the good stuff came out.  He was agreeing with you.  I'm agreeing with Ope, and he's still screaming at me.  Oh, I know.  Yeah.  So Earl comes in, and he's like, hey, so what do you think?  You know, the Mets might get Moises Alou. 
[00:11:00]  I think it's a good move.  I'm like, of course it's a good move, Earl.  It's like the Knicks have a shot at Kobe Bryant.  I think that's a good move for the team.  I think that's a great move.  A guy bats 350 at 30 home.  He's a great outfield.  I think that would help.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  Oh, and he's injury prone.  That's why I asked you.  It's because your team's not in the series.  Don't get bitter with me.  Oh.  Don't.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Oh, I hope he's throwing things at Earl. 
[00:11:30]  Earl just ran out of here.  It doesn't look good.  I'll tell you that.  He's got that Muslim rage going again.  You know, you take out your warrior like that.  You know what?  Pack your bags.  Pack your effing bags.  I will say that.  I will say after he struck, you know, after the ace, I got a little more confident.  I went, wow, this guy's got something.  Yeah.  He's got that little Kent to Kobe thing going on.  That wacky little sidearm swing thing he does there.  And that weird leg thing.  Yeah. 
[00:12:00]  He's got a weird throw.  He's only like four foot five.  Yeah.  No, he's hate.  Don't do it, no, he.  Don't try.  As he throws the ball.  Don't be.  Don't be.  Don't try.  Don't try.  Don't try.  Don't try.  Don't try.  Don't try. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, Bruerts.  I don't know.  I mean, I'm just, I don't know what to say, man.  I feel like I just got punched in the nuts.  The CIA has determined the Yankees have to win for the people in New York.  I'm telling you, come on.  Come on.  I mean, 86 Mets, you just saw it happening.  You're like, okay, there was a little G-Pin, Carter, and then the wild pick.  You just saw it.  Right.  Well, it sounds like, all right, two outs, and this guy's going, oh, my God. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Is this when the Hulk loses, and now we're going to have, like, a whole line of, you know,  dolls for this guy?  Yeah.  It was just, hey, I got to take off my hat, though.  I got to.  What can you say?  I don't know what you can say.  If I could go to the instant feedback quickly, Victor from Manhattan says, jerk off.  You don't know S.  Schilling was getting rocked.  They had guys on third base in the sixth and seventh.  He got out of the inning.  He almost threw a couple of wild pitches. 
[00:13:30]  Martinez and Jeter would have hit homers off him.  They're the guys that had hit off of him earlier.  That is.  So it's like, obviously that S doesn't know anything about baseball.  No matter, it happens, the climbers happens to a lot of people.  You go through some tough innings in a game.  The fact is, it was 2-1.  3-1.  3-1 at that point.  Sorry, I'm hopped up here.  And he was throwing 98 miles per hour.  Yeah, no.  He should start the inning.  He was mentally just, just balling them. 
[00:14:00]  Brewer.  Holy S.  At the worst, you know, he starts the inning and gives up, like, a leadoff base hit.  Okay, that's it.  That's it.  Take him out.  There you go.  He didn't get a little nervous.  But he's got to go to the next inning at that point.  Brewer, you want to make your, try to make your money back from last year?  The only thing I can go on is the amount of games.  It's, it's, well, you know something?  We're both wrong.  What do you want to say?  Six or seven?  You think they'll take it in six?  No, I'm just saying, you know, we're all even now.  So screw it.  Let's just go.  Who takes this? 
[00:14:30]  This is a tough one.  Brewer, take it.  A thousand bucks, Brewer.  How much?  It was the bet from last year.  Look at him.  Yeah, you know what?  Last year, it was worth it because it was sort of like the chick you knew.  It was the Mets, right?  You know, it was the Mets.  I can deal with the loss.  I defended them.  I ain't going to defend no desert, dude.  I have no confidence in Bob Brindley.  Yeah. 
[00:15:00]  If it was the Mets, I'd say, all right, I'll have to put up the,  even if I knew they were going to lose.  But I'm not going to put money on, what, Gonzalez and whatever it want to make.  Eric P. writing in saying, 98 miles per hour, no movement means home run.  Opie, you're getting, I don't know.  He don't know what he's talking about.  He does.  Yeah, Roger Clemens has a lot of movement on his fastball.  Yeah, I mean, get out of him.  Clemens has seen some better days.  I'll admit that.  I just, you know.  It's a whole mental strategy. 
[00:15:30]  It's like the bully.  The bully shows up and just stares at you, and you haven't been able to hit him all game.  It messes with your head.  Yeah.  Like, damn, now I'm bound by two.  As soon as he's out, they're like, damn, he's out.  Let's kick the daylights out of his friend.  I haven't seen so many people just stand there and watch a strike pitch go right by him when Schilling's pitching.  I have to say the funniest thing, I really, Anthony, what you're talking about is he really didn't look like he had a clue what happened.  He's just smiling like, do I still get ice cream at the ball game? 
[00:16:00]  He's smiling.  He watched that ball go over his head, and he just looks at it and smiles like, oh, man, it's good.  It's a good game.  He's as long as he gets the ice cream.  You know, he gets to go to Carvel after the game.  Free snow cone.  Free snow cone after the game.  You play half game, you still get a whole snow cone.  You give up a whole lot, you still get a whole snow cone.  He didn't know what the hell was going on.  Brian Regan, thank you.  Oh, well, what are you going to do?  Yeah.  All right, bro.  Hey, well, you guys have a fun day.  I'm going to go urinate somewhere. 
[00:16:30]  Cool.  And I'll talk to you guys soon.  I'll be in town like a week.  All right, peace.  All right, man.  Be safe later.  There he goes, faggot.  How are you doing?  How are you, bro?  That's good.  All right.  Wow, I hope the gook talk didn't offend Chicago too much.  Don't want them messing with our show again.  Well, they'll dump right out of anything you say about Chicago, Opie.  I don't even know if we're on in Chicago today.  I don't know. 
[00:17:00]  Is there a special Olympics javelin throw happening that they preempted our show for?  Do they have a big gook community, too?  Oh, wow.  Dicks.  Any city is diverse, Opie, so perhaps, yes, they would have a...  We're on a station in Chicago that doesn't get us or this program.  Nope.  And the sooner we're off it, the better we'll all be.  We're on it, um...  I think for other reasons than to do well and entertain people and bring ratings to their station.  All right. 
[00:17:30]  Well, we have to take a break.  We can get into that a little bit more.  I mean, uh...  Wow, the phone's just lit.  If you're on hold, stay there.  We're going to try to get to all of you, okay?  All right.  All right.  Hey, oh, uh...  We have tickets for tonight's game?  We have to do it.  Yes, we do.  Two pairs.  Two pairs.  How you doing?  We've got to do a little bit better than, um...  Oh, that lame ass.  Than yesterday's contest.  Oof.  I was going to...  Lame.  I...  What? 
[00:18:00]  They're last-minute tickets again, so we've got to figure out how to give them away.  Yeah.  Lisa got...  I got your tickets.  My...  I got...  I got...  How you doing?  We've got to figure it out.  Yeah.  Tickets.  Two...  Two pair.  That we have to give away in, like, two hours.  So it's...  Two hours.  You know what I mean?  It doesn't give us, you know, much to work with.  No, no, it doesn't.  I would love to do, like, you know, the wildest thing you would do for Yankee tickets, something  like that. 
[00:18:30]  Kind of short notice.  Unless there are people close by.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Race around the park for Earl?  Shut up, you tool.  Wow, you're going way back with that.  Give Earl.  Give Earl a hug.  Please, that would open it up only to guys.  All right, well, we'll go to the phones next.  Hey, there.  Something strange is happening here.  There's something wrong with us.  How do we play what's in my pants?  Something very, very wrong with us. 
[00:19:00]  What's a little contributing to the delinquency of a minor?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Guess what's in, teen pants?  Anthony, Sam, effin' Adams.  Sam Adams, we love it.  We were pounding that up in Boston, man.  We love Sam Adams.  They partnered up with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon at Project Greenlight to help independent  filmmakers break into the movie making.  That's right.  Gives you a chance to slip in the Hollywood's back door, they call it.  Mmm.  Sam Adams and Project Greenlight.  They share similar philosophies, fostering and supporting independent thinking and creative 
[00:19:30]  excellence.  Sam Adams' passion in independence and brewing.  Passion.  And independence and brewing.  Produce some of the world's best beers.  And that's for sure.  They really, they care about beer making.  You know what I mean?  Rick, yes.  He looked at me like, I love my nut.  I love Sam Adams.  We drink it here.  It's a little early right now, but later on, I will be enjoying an ice-cold Sam.  And you should, too.  A lot of the seasonal beers now.  The Oktoberfest and whatnot. 
[00:20:00]  So pick it up when you're out at a bar or if you're home, get some for the fridge.  Watching the Yanks.  Sam Adams.  1027.  WNEW.  And we're back with the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The phone's just lit today.  Oh, yeah.  All right, we got a couple pairs of tickets to the game tonight.  Of course, talking about the World Series.  Yeah.  This is what we're going to do. 
[00:20:30]  If you want a chance to win Yankee tickets tonight,  you've got to be outside the Brooklyn Diner by 5 o'clock,  and then we'll tell you what's going on.  That's it.  Two pairs of tickets for tonight's game.  If you want a chance to win tickets,  get outside the Brooklyn Diner by 5 o'clock.  And then contest is on.  Yeah.  That's it.  We'll redeem ourselves from yesterday's mess. 
[00:21:00]  Oh.  That show.  Brooklyn Diner located at 57th and 7th.  All between Broadway and 7th.  I know.  Close enough.  Go to the phones.  Lou, what's going on, man?  Lou?  Lou!  Lou, Lou, Lou, Lou.  Lou, we're taking a phone call, Lou.  Come on. 
[00:21:30]  Come on, Lou.  Talk to us.  Lou?  Lou?  Lou?  Lou?  Lou?  Lou?  All right.  Go to Murr.  Very good call there.  Let's move on to Michael.  Michael, you're next on the Opie and Anthony show.  You know, Opie, you know,  there's a radio gag.  It should be the curse or anything else,  and then it's the truth.  You talk about, you know,  them taking Schillinger out,  whatever, the pitcher.  I mean, look at El Duque.  How many balls did he throw last night?  El Duque looked like crap.  And we said they still lost.  Beginning of the game.  It was a little rough. 
[00:22:00]  He was walking.  He was putting men on base every day.  He was still loaded the first inning.  I know.  You know why?  Because Opie's rooting for the damn Arizona.  What is this, news you're telling us?  We understand that.  I was the guy who called and won the money off the bonds.  Remember that?  The home run?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I just bet $1,000.  I just had a buyout to break even, man.  Because they're going to win the Yankees.  That's it.  I'm a Met fan, too, as well.  You know, Michael,  I've got to interrupt this phone call  because Lisa the sales whore just called. 
[00:22:30]  It's all about sales.  Let's not worry about the radio program and...  Holy S.  Anthony, the Yankee tickets, courtesy of Budweiser.  Budweiser, the king of effing beers and Major League Baseball.  There you go.  Don't worry, Lisa.  They'll get their mentions today.  That's right.  What?  We have salespeople that...  They don't even care.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to go nuts.  Well, because it's such inside radio again.  We have salespeople. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  They don't care what we do on our show.  They really don't.  Yeah.  They don't care, you know,  if we had a good discussion about what's going on in Afghanistan  or if we're getting stupid,  if we're making people laugh,  if Ant's doing good voices.  Just mention.  If I'm losing my effing mind.  All they care about is their clients  and making sure they get their mentions in.  That's all they care about.  That's what I do.  After every live read,  half these sales guys upstairs,  you know, make our people run around to get copies of it.  Can I have a copy of the tape?  I'm talking about the thing. 
[00:23:30]  We have a very good relationship with Budweiser, Lisa.  They're going to get their mentions.  Relax.  Okay.  I understand.  It's just that a lot of times...  I thought she was calling in maybe  because, you know,  she had something to add to the fine show  and the Yankee talk or whatever.  No.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, do you realize the guys forgot to mention  that the tickets are courtesy of Budweiser?  That's right.  I didn't mean to mention that 
[00:24:00]  because if I...  Hey, Lisa.  I love bush beer.  Ah.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Can't get enough bush.  Anheuser-Busch.  St. Louis, Missouri.  Oh, it is?  Damn.  I love...  What's that Mexican beer?  What?  Corona.  Yeah.  Actually, I do love Corona.  Hi, Michael.  So continue.  Well, you know,  I'm just saying,  it's just... 
[00:24:30]  It's really strange, Opie.  I mean,  whatever you say,  who's going to win  or whoever you're rooting for,  it's the truth.  I mean, look at this.  Jeter.  Two and three.  I mean, three and two.  Jeter's been in a bit of a slump there.  Jeter's hitting what?  78 for the series?  I don't care.  I'm sitting there cursing at you  last night,  screaming at the TV.  Michael!  I want to put my hands around your neck  and listen to the sound of the breaking cartilage.  You understand that?  Michael.  Wow.  Michael.  I was screaming at myself.  I don't care.  I was screaming at myself. 
[00:25:00]  I'm done with you, Opie.  But whoever you say is going to win,  I'm betting against, okay?  I had a buyout.  I lost money.  Join the club.  Get on board, man.  I walked into my bathroom,  I looked at myself in the mirror,  and I gave myself a good talking to.  Did you?  I hate myself.  Oh, I wanted to crucify you so bad.  I'm just so sick.  I'm sick of time.  And on top of that,  on top of that,  I've never been more tired in my life  because we did two days in Boston,  then we drove all day yesterday,  then did the radio show.  Hence the Jim Brewer bit  at the end of the show.  What?  What?  I thought that was nice of Jim  to show up late in the show yesterday. 
[00:25:30]  To save our asses?  Yeah, I thought it was nice, too, Ant.  Opie, don't you think  the Yankees are going to win now, or what?  I want the Diamondbacks.  No, no, don't say that.  I mean, I already have a buyout, anyway.  I have a buyout.  I want the Diamondbacks.  I go way back with Curt Schilling, by the way.  I think we've talked about this on the air.  Yeah, I know that.  We both started our careers together  in Rochester  when he was pitching  for the Rochester Red Wings.  Oh, there you go.  And I was just a little radio guy  working for Brother Weez at WCMF,  and we would spend afternoons  on Weez's boat 
[00:26:00]  drinking beers and laughing,  and Schilling took me under his wing,  and I got to hang out  with all the baseball guys  and party.  That's great.  And watch them all pick up women,  and I would get their sloppy seconds.  That was Schilling?  And I'm sitting there  at the first inning,  and the base is still loaded,  I'm saying,  here we go.  You didn't know that?  No, I remember the story  you told me about a baseball play,  but I didn't know it was Schilling.  Curt Schilling.  This is like the late 80s.  This is great.  Place your bets, man.  Oh, man.  Jesus Palomino.  Hey, Anthony, enjoy yourself,  because, you know,  I've lost money on it,  and you should abuse him 
[00:26:30]  because that is the curse.  Now, was he hanging out?  It's the curse, man.  I believe it.  Bopey, was he hanging out  with you or Spuds Buckley?  No, Spuds Buckley was Buffalo.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  Get your radio market straight.  I mean, it's good to kid about it,  the radio gag of that,  but it's true.  And Schilling used to talk about,  you know,  wanting to make it  to the World Series someday.  He wasn't even in the majors yet.  And we go out,  I've had more beers  with that guy  than I could care to think about.  Face is loaded, though,  in the first inning.  I'm like, here we go.  Get a couple of runs going. 
[00:27:00]  And it's like, boom.  And I'm like,  Opie, U.S. Opie.  And then he's throwing all the balls.  I'm like,  this is El Duque,  Mr. El Duque,  who's a great pitcher, right?  Yeah, right.  All right.  Michael, we've got to move on  because everybody wants to do it.  Thanks a lot, Opie.  Appreciate it.  All right, bye.  But the other thing  I just want to mention,  I bet you guys  were all in the same ballpark.  Like, how tired were you  trying to watch that game last night?  I know.  It was kind of a chore.  I went to bed at 9.30  with the game on.  Yeah.  Just fighting.  At one point,  I was punching myself in the face 
[00:27:30]  to try to stay awake.  I was falling asleep  five minutes here,  five minutes there.  Yeah, it was rough to get through.  Oh, I've never been  more tired in my life.  But had to watch.  Had to watch.  Doug from Springfield,  what's up?  What's up?  Did you hear about  Bushbeard just went out of business?  Oh, yeah.  By the way,  Opie, the Phoenix Coyote 3,  the Buffalo Sabres 2.  It works in hockey, too.  I don't like the Sabres, man.  Later, guys.  I'm an Islander fan.  My team is undefeated.  Oh, please.  Wait until they play the Rangers.  Come on. 
[00:28:00]  Rangers don't.  Are you serious?  The Islanders have a better team  than the Rangers this year.  Oh, yeah.  You keep dreaming  when you're punching your face  when you're saying that, too?  You really think the Rangers  don't have a better team  than the Islanders?  Seriously, now.  Pekka?  Okay.  Osgood, Yashin.  All right.  All right.  We had a fine offseason,  my friend.  Offseason.  And you Flyers,  shut the F up.  We're going to kick your ass  this Saturday.  Oh, God.  I know what I'm betting  this weekend.  Later, guys.  Bye.  Holy Jesus.  The money that can be made.  Shut up. 
[00:28:30]  You've just been disinvited  to every Islander game.  Mark that clip  because we're going  to be playing it.  I need to go down to Philly  to watch that game,  matter of fact.  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, Ope,  you know what the problem is?  You're a retarded Nostradamus.  No matter what you say,  it doesn't come true.  It's exactly the opposite.  Yeah, I know.  Let's look at this quatrain.  Islanders beat the Flyers.  The boys from the land of Isle  will stand against the Philly. 
[00:29:00]  Rob, what's up?  You just did it, Ope.  You just did it, dude.  I begged him.  Get me on soon.  I don't want to hear you  say the Islanders  until July.  It has been 14 years  of hockey pestilence  and you just screwed it up.  But you know something?  The Islanders have been  doing very well.  Ope's been a fan.  He has season tickets  and I don't know why.  Just think of how great  they'd be if Ope wasn't a fan.  My love,  I'm jumping around.  I'm jumping around  screaming we got a team  this year.  My wife likes it better  when I just sulk in the corner.  Now I'm going to go 
[00:29:30]  sulk in the corner.  I love the Ranger fans  trying to abuse us this year.  We really do have  a team this year.  Much better than the Rangers.  The Rangers can't get  the fuck out of the net.  Thank you.  Later, dudes.  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right, all right, all right.  Vito, you're next.  Vito.  Vito, what's up, man?  Lost Vito.  We got to move fast here  because everyone wants in today.  Tom, you're next  on the Ope and Anthony show.  Hey, I just want to bet  my house is on flyers.  You're going to bet  your house?  You loser.  He's betting his house. 
[00:30:00]  Houses.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  Let me go to Rich.  Rich, what's up?  Yo, Ope, real simply,  I know you're a Mets fan,  but what is your vehemence  against the Yankees?  Why don't you root  for the home team?  My second question is,  who's had more balls  to the face,  Yoki Barra or Rich?  Rick.  That old gag.  Rich, here's the deal.  It's simple.  I mean, I don't have to talk  for everyone else out there,  but Yankee fans  are cocky to begin with. 
[00:30:30]  Second of all,  there are two types  of New York fans.  I'm a hardcore New York fan.  I got my teams.  I got my Islanders.  I got my Mets.  I got my Knicks.  And I got my Jets.  There are other New York fans  out there.  When their team is out of it,  then they root for the other  New York team.  I don't do that.  I've never done that.  Okay, but...  Giants and the Super Bowl...  Giants and the Super Bowl,  I was loving the fact  they lost.  Loving it.  Yeah, I shot through that also.  But, you know,  there are a lot of New York fans  like, all right,  Mets are out of it, 
[00:31:00]  then they start rooting  for the Yankees.  But I'll tell you right now,  I'm not alone on this.  There's a lot of Mets fans  that are definitely rooting  against the Yankees.  Greg from New York  checking and saying,  the worst thing about  Opie's sports picks  is that you can't turn  the radio off  and make it go away.  Make him effing stop.  I guess there's some  Islander fans  and some D-back fans  out there that  are a little pissed.  Hey, dude,  there's got to be a way  you could use this power  to make some money.  There's got to be a way.  I mean,  I've never seen a curse 
[00:31:30]  this evil in my life.  I mean, you know,  you're dead on accurate.  You know,  it was Schilling's game  to lose.  They should have  kept him in there.  If he lost it,  he lost it.  Big deal.  Meanwhile,  they bring this  sidearm gook in  and what good does he do?  Hey, be careful  with that gook talk.  CKG in Chicago  is going to dump out of this.  They're very sensitive  up there.  Oh, I'm sorry.  The Asian individual.  Very good.  Talk to you later,  mate.  All right. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, what?  Oh, whew.  You ever like  doze off a little bit  and then that thing  does it and your arm  kind of twitches real hard?  What's happening  during Lewis's call?  I don't understand.  What makes that happen?  Like, I was just  about asleep  and then, oh,  you get jostled awake  like that.  I thought we were  going to get  Lewis Black  on the phone.  I called him  his cell phone  was on  but I left  a message  so I was hoping  to get it.  He was with these  phones.  He was topless  on the deal  last night.  We got to bust  his bullies.  I'll call him again.  By the way, 
[00:32:30]  we got a couple  pairs of tickets  to the World Series  tonight.  I forgot who gave  us these tickets.  was it Sam Adams?  No, it's Budweiser.  Tickets courtesy  of Sam Adams, was it?  Budweiser,  the king of beers, Opie.  Budweiser or Sam Adams?  I can't remember.  Budweiser.  I wish Lisa would call  to let us know  because, you know.  It's Budweiser 
[00:33:00]  because I don't have  a brain  and I need her  to tell me  what I need to say  on the radio.  So, it's what?  Budweiser?  Budweiser.  You sure?  Well, if you're wrong,  don't worry.  At least we'll call  within seconds  to correct us.  Anyway,  got a couple  pairs of tickets.  This is what  we're looking for you  to do,  to show up 
[00:33:30]  at the stadium,  the station.  Yeah.  I am so wound up  today.  Outside the  Brooklyn Diner,  57th between  7th and Broadway.  You've got to be  there by 5,  and then we'll  tell you what  you have to do  for the tickets  for tonight's game  at the stadium.  Okay?  So, show up.  Steve from Oceanside  on Bizarro World.  Lewis would be  the most beloved  character on O&A.  Cricket's always funny.  Lewis, bad radio curse,  worse than Opie's  sports curse.  The people love  when Lewis calls up  with his comedy 
[00:34:00]  kryptonite.  I don't mind the Lewis guy.  You don't mind the Lewis.  I will never understand  why you even take  the call.  I like being annoyed,  so I don't mind it.  Okay, that makes sense.  There's something in me.  I enjoy being annoyed.  Is it true, Opie,  you took...  Up to a certain point,  and then I lose  my effing mind.  Yes, Anthony?  Is it true you took  Custer plus six points  at Little Bighorn?  Bernie, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good.  What is going on  with CKJ here in Chicago, man?  Ah.  They're killing you guys. 
[00:34:30]  You guys don't...  I'm sure you guys  do know what's going on,  but last night,  listening to the show,  you guys got the contestants  in there for the best costume.  Yeah.  Next thing you know,  Brewers on talking  about a bomb in Sears.  What is going on?  The hockey games  that they're playing?  Are you kidding me?  The hockey game  will start tonight  at 6.30?  Yeah.  It's tape delayed  until 8 o'clock.  So now we're being preempted...  Wait, wait.  It's tape delayed  until 8 o'clock.  No way.  We're being preempted  for tape delayed.  Last night, 
[00:35:00]  your guys' show  started at 9.15.  It never starts on time.  They always got to get  the other clowns in first.  Get Ken Stevens on the line  because he needs  to hear this one  because we...  I was listening  to your guys' Philly show.  Yeah.  You guys are in Philly.  Last break comes  at the last hour.  You guys come back.  You're at a Spinal Tap concert.  They cut out  the last hour of that, too.  Oh, no, that was us  being lazy.  It is terrible.  We have enough...  We have enough...  Lately, when you guys  are talking about CKG,  it's dead air.  I'll be at work listening. 
[00:35:30]  Dead air.  All right.  That is so funny.  All of a sudden,  in the middle of our show,  you mean it'll go to  some other bit  that happened  like a while ago?  Yeah.  You're talking about  the Philly show?  Oh, you're talking  about the Philly show?  You go, all right,  we'll go.  We have another break.  You go to break.  You come back.  Yeah, we come back.  It's Spinal Tap.  Oh, my God.  That's some  irresponsible broadcasting.  God damn.  I must say,  I'm with you on this one, Bernie.  It's terrible.  If they can't put  the pieces of the show  together right,  what the hell  are we supposed to do?  I heard the last night's segment,  the last segment of the show  where we had the girls 
[00:36:00]  on the lesbian couch  really going at it.  Yeah.  It never aired.  What aired in its place?  Brewer talking about  a bomb-threaded Sears.  Oh.  You know what?  A good show will be tomorrow  because we'll have  the hockey game on.  And about time  the hockey game's over  and the postgame  and the locker room interview  and what's going around  the AHL and...  Wait, Bernie.  ...all the other shows  they got.  Bernie, are we really  being preempted for  tape-delayed  minor league hockey tonight?  Yes.  It starts at 6.30 tonight.  On the radio,  it won't start till 8.  No way.  Tape-delayed.  And you know what happens then? 
[00:36:30]  Someone has to confirm that for me  because this is just beyond amazing.  When it comes to your guys' show  after the hockey game  and all the other crap  that they have,  you guys come on  and this is going to be  a great show.  We've got this guest,  we've got that guest,  and you go on for about 20 minutes  and then you go,  all right,  we've got to take a break.  Then when it comes back,  oh, that was the best show  we ever did.  Thanks for this guy.  Thanks for Jim for showing up.  And then they cut out everything.  I mean, that's bad  when you're saying  what a great show you just had.  Coming from,  who's going to be on the show?  All right, Bernie.  Thank you.  Oh, you guys suck. 
[00:37:00]  All right.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Well, there's a lot of truths  and mistruths  to what Bernie just said.  We've been kind of talking  to our boss  about our Chicago situation  all day today.  We went to lunch and everything.  We've proven we can do well  in cities that we are in live  and that support this show.  Look, I don't want  to be on in Chicago anymore  under these circumstances.  No.  We're going to try  to get off of the Chicago station.  It'll be spun in the press 
[00:37:30]  that they kicked us off.  That's not true.  The facts are very simple.  They don't really get the show.  They don't really want it  to succeed  because they're doing  a lot of things  to tell us  that that's what's going on.  I think having us  on that station,  a little more of a defensive move  than an offensive move.  Our show is preempted  for minor league hockey  because they made  a lot of money  to air the minor league hockey games.  None of this will air  in Chicago  because another thing  we learned was 
[00:38:00]  if we make fun  of the station,  they cut it all  out of our show.  Another reason why  I don't want any part  of this Chicago station  at this time, Anthony.  Like when we make fun  of Tim Sabian  and YSP and stuff,  they go with it  because it makes  for some good radio.  It's fun.  Right.  So now we're hearing  that we're going  to be preempted  for tape-delayed  minor league hockey.  So if you're into  the minor league hockey,  you'll pretty much  know the outcome anyway  and you won't have 
[00:38:30]  to listen to it  on the radio.  Right.  Tape-delayed.  Right.  And then we found out  that they dumped out  of the word spick  because there's a huge  Oh my goodness.  huge Hispanic community  in Chicago  and they thought  that was unacceptable  so now they're editing  the show  that suits their needs.  Well, I agree with that  because that shouldn't  be said.  Plus, they're now  calling the station  The Fun House.  The Fun House.  I don't want to be part  of anything called  The Fun House.  Doesn't that sound  like something 
[00:39:00]  a Fun House station  would have?  The Fun House.  Is that smoke  I'm smelling?  Another burnt bridge?  Oh, well.  Oops.  And then like  the new PD's  bragging to the media  and stuff  how he's got  this great idea  he's going to call  the station  The Fun House.  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony  on The Fun House  and they want us  to cut liners.  Hey, it's Opie and Anthony  and you're listening  to The Fun House.  The Fun House. 
[00:39:30]  Please.  So, yeah,  there's a couple  of issues.  There's more issues.  We don't want to  bore you guys  but it's just  a nightmare.  We want to be  on stations  that really support  the show  and want to see  it succeed.  Not just throw it  in the middle  of the night  and hope that  we don't go  somewhere else  and kick their ass.  Which is pretty much  what I think  is going on.  Oh, please.  That's obvious.  Even though Ken  has told me  to calm down  and you shouldn't  say any of that stuff 
[00:40:00]  because we don't  know for sure.  Right.  Yeah, right.  Sure, we don't.  Yeah, I've only  been doing radio  for I think  a couple months  now, right?  Sure.  I'm naive  just like every  other program  director out there,  right?  Lewis Black,  what's up?  I knew you guys  would wait until  they started  doing the plane  announcements.  Oh, you're on  the airplane.  I'm on the airplane  but it hasn't  moved yet.  Ah.  So they haven't  told you to not  use the cell phone  or anything?  No, I've still  got time here  but I've actually  wanted to get  I was hoping to 
[00:40:30]  get some minor  league hockey.  Ah, yeah,  instead of this show.  You know, we get  pissed off when we  get preempted for  the NFL.  Yeah.  But I understand  why we get  preempted for the  NFL.  That's a pretty  big deal in a lot  of cities.  Right.  But minor league  hockey in a market  where you have the  Chicago Blackhawks.  Exactly.  And then on top  of that, you know,  the program director  and general manager  are like, well, we  want to work this  out with the guys  because, you know,  we don't understand  why they're so upset. 
[00:41:00]  No one listens to  minor league hockey  on the radio.  No one.  Especially when you  have the NHL in  town.  And now tonight  we're finding out  that the minor league  hockey game is going  to be on tape  delay.  We're looking into  that because I'm  not positive.  But is that the  same?  What station is  that?  WCKG in Chicago.  Is there anybody  on that station  that would be  like someone,  you know,  like who would be 
[00:41:30]  in competition  with you during  the day on any  level?  Yeah, I think so.  Sure.  That might have  something to do  with it.  I think, you know,  because the station  may be just doing  it, you know what  I mean.  Oh my God,  Doug from  Springfield.  Louis, hold on  for two seconds,  okay?  I got no life.  Hold on, hold on.  Check this out.  Doug from  Springfield.  This is Doug  from Doug's  cousin from  Springfield,  Chicago.  The Chicago  Wolves haven't  won a game in  five games.  What's going on  there? 
[00:42:00]  What's their  record this year,  Doug?  I don't know for  sure, but I was  told they haven't  won a game in  five games.  I hear about this  curse.  What's going on?  I talked to my  cousin Doug from  Springfield, New  Jersey, and he  said there's a bad  curse coming on.  So the minor  league hockey team  on top of it  stinks.  Yes, please.  Go to another  station.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, Doug.  All right.  It said on the  screen they were  0 and 10.  I know.  That would have  just put me over  the top today.  Louis, so where  are you flying to?  I'm in Manchester,  New Hampshire.  It's a part of my  Reach Out to 
[00:42:30]  Small Village  program.  Is that what  you're doing?  Yes.  You're going to  I've been on a  plane since I saw  you guys.  Yeah, Louis flies  around a lot.  I do it all the  time.  And you have no  problem with the  security and  everything?  Not at all.  Did they frisk me  again today?  They did?  Yes.  Would you have on  you anything?  It's an enjoyable  process.  I just take garbage  out of my pockets.  Yeah.  It's like I sit  there and take  garbage out of my  pockets and throw  it in front of  them and they keep  going and it keeps  making noise.  Have you had  anything that they've  taken away from you? 
[00:43:00]  No, there's  nothing to take.  What have I got?  I don't know.  You know, they  looked through my  wallet today.  Really?  Yeah, because you  can carry a  saber in there.  What can you  carry in a wallet?  Like a toothpick?  Yeah, a box  cutter?  Right.  A razor blade or  something.  Lewis?  Lewis?  Yeah.  Are you topless  right now?  No, but I know  that that would  excite you guys.  Well, when I was  watching the Daily  Show and Back in 
[00:43:30]  Black, your segment  came on and at the  end of your segment,  I see a completely  topless Lewis Black  wearing a beret and  screaming.  That's right.  Looks like that gym  membership's doing you  well.  Oh, yeah.  You can see.  You can see by my  pasty white jowls  that I'm really  looking good.  There he was.  That was Lewis  screaming with a 
[00:44:00]  beret on his head  and topless.  Lewis, what were  you thinking during  that?  I was just, you know  what I was thinking?  You know what you're  thinking at the  11th hour?  It will get a laugh.  It will get a laugh.  If the scream  doesn't, the  toplessness will, and  if the toplessness  doesn't work, a red  beret will always  work.  Yeah, the red, I  didn't get the red 
[00:44:30]  beret.  Was that the  camouflage that it  was actually you?  No, that was  because since this  was supposed to be  taken, you know,  since this was  1984.  Right.  You know, we  wanted, we didn't  want to show my, you  know, that I  basically looked the  same.  Oh, right, right.  So it covers up  the hairstyle.  I actually wanted  to wear a diaphragm  on my head, but  they wouldn't allow  that.  You are a pisser,  man.  I saw that.  Can you believe  that?  It's like, hey,  there's our pal  topless.  That's right.  Yeah, and it  was a little  segment on 
[00:45:00]  screaming, on a  screaming competition.  Yeah, that I  would have won.  Yeah.  Starters.  But second,  you know, it's  like, you know,  it's like I  didn't even think  about it.  You know what  I mean?  Yeah.  That's how nuts  I think I've  become.  Can I ask you  though, why?  I think you  could have done  the same thing  and it would  have had the  same impact  had you been  wearing a shirt.  Probably.  But we thought  that everybody,  all the writers  said topless  was funny.  All the writers  said topless.  Paul Mercurio 
[00:45:30]  in on that vote?  If Paul wasn't  involved, I  would have  taken, Paul  would have  had to come  out of his  sitcom session.  Paul would have  had to come  out of his  sitcom session.  Is that it?  You know, in  order to kind  of help make  a decision on  that.  I thought he'd  probably vote,  Lewis, take  your pants off  too.  Well, exactly.  And I would  if it was,  because I am  so tired from  traveling that it's  like, you know,  whatever you say,  I go, okay.  And plus, I think  this puts in a bid  for the, there'll be  a topless  voyeur bus with  just Norton  and I. 
[00:46:00]  You can just  pop yourself  against the  window.  Just Norton  and I rubbing  ourselves against  the window.  Will we be  lucky enough to  have a Lewis  Black topless  segment?  I would  certainly come  by.  Next time you  come in, can  you be topless?  Yeah.  Only for you  guys.  Only for you  guys, because  you're the only  guys.  My mother hasn't  called yet.  You've called  before my mother.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Lewis.  Well, have fun  wherever you're  going.  Certainly  will.  Be safe. 
[00:46:30]  Be safe.  Hey, Lewis, I saw  American Dummy  finally.  Do you like it?  Oh, that is  hysterical.  I really did, man.  Yeah.  It could have  been a little  longer, I  thought.  Yeah.  It could have.  But you guys  were all awesome,  man.  I was laughing.  I was giggling  like a little  schoolgirl.  Nothing better  than a Norton  spit take, too,  where he spits  out his drink.  Lewis was the  comedy club owner.  Yeah.  You were good,  dude.  Sandy's like,  what's up with  Lewis's hair?  Because it looked  like he got a perm  for the part or  something.  It was all  poofy.  Yeah. 
[00:47:00]  You know, I keep  it like a chameleon.  Yeah.  The ever-changing,  topless, you know,  curly hair.  But, no, Norton's  funny in that, and  Brewer kills in that.  Yeah, Brewer's good.  Oh, God, we just  had him on the phone.  Yeah.  The King of  Canarsie.  I'm going to bust  his bullies.  Very funny.  All right.  Got to check it  out.  I don't even know  where people could  check out that movie.  I think we had a  link on foundrymusic.com  for a while.  I think it's the same  place.  There's going to be a  link in a little bit.  I just got to find the 
[00:47:30]  link to where you can  buy it.  That's all.  Yeah, we'll link it to  our underground website,  foundrymusic.com.  All right, Lewis.  Hey, guys.  Everything okay  otherwise?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we're doing  good.  Well, I miss you.  Well, come see us.  All right.  I'll come see you  topless.  All right.  All right, Lewis.  Take care, guys.  There he goes.  Have a good flight.  Thanks.  Bye-bye.  Lewis Black, everyone.  I just didn't get  why he was topless  during that segment.  A little odd.  Because the writer  said topless,  more funny.  I don't know.  Whatever.  More gooder, 
[00:48:00]  if topless.  I thought he could  have done it.  We didn't even know  it was him at first.  We had to rewind.  Was that Lewis?  Rewind, because it  would be silly to  have your shirt off.  It was him.  All right, spots.  Was that Lisa,  or is that Ben  telling me?  Ben's telling me now.  Okay.  Yeah.  Two pairs of tickets  to the World Series  for tonight's game  at the stadium.  At 5 o'clock,  you have an hour.  Right.  To get to the  Brooklyn Diner  between, well,  it's on 57th 
[00:48:30]  between 7th and Broadway.  And then we'll have  Rick or somebody  down there with a megaphone  and they'll tell you  what you have to do  for the Yankee tickets,  okay?  Cool.  So if you want a chance  to win,  get your ass over  to the Brooklyn Diner.  Rainwreck Radio.  With a bunch of people  cheering on a rake.  That's going to make  a sweeper.  Scum.  Anthony.  Slime.  The Opie and Anthony  Show.  And we're back  with the O&A Show.  If you're not  in the New York area,  give us a call  as well. 
[00:49:00]  Phone number  866-277-4WOW.  A lot of people  begging us to  extend the meeting  outside the Brooklyn  Diner  until 5.30.  That's not a bad idea  because people  get out of work  at 5.  For your chance  to win Yankee tickets,  tickets to the World Series  tonight at Yankee Stadium.  We've got a couple  pairs of tickets.  We'll do that  because there are  enough people  in the area  that get off at 5.  They can't leave work  early,  so I think that's fair.  So this is what 
[00:49:30]  we're looking  for you to do.  Get outside  the Brooklyn Diner  by 5.30.  Yes.  And then we'll  announce how  you can win  Yankee tickets.  Very cool.  Two pairs  for tonight's game  courtesy of  Budweiser Beer.  The King of Beers.  The King of Beers.  11-year-old Gary  wants to apologize.  He had a really bad  phone call with us  yesterday.  Gary.  Guys, I'm really sorry. 
[00:50:00]  I'm down the weather  and I think I have  anthrax or something.  You don't have  the anthrax.  No.  My neighbor  got an envelope  and she brought it  over to see  if it was,  but she touched it  and her husband  opened it,  so I don't know  if I do or not.  Wait, wait, wait,  wait, wait, wait, wait,  wait.  Your neighbor  had an envelope  that was a little  suspicious,  so she decided  to bring it over  to your house  and open it?  No.  She had it in a foil,  but she opened it  with her,  she grabbed it  from the garbage 
[00:50:30]  with her hands,  not rubber gloves.  Yeah.  And her husband  opened it  and I asked  did he like  smell it,  like to say  if there was  any powder  or something.  She goes,  well, he did.  Who's smelling,  who is smelling  anything white  these days?  You don't smell it.  You're not even  supposed to move it  if it's suspicious.  I guarantee  because of this  anthrax thing,  cocaine sales  have drastically  decreased.  Yeah.  That's true.  In America?  Because, I mean,  what does coke make you?  Very paranoid  to begin with.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  Who in their right mind  is going to see  that white powder  and start snorting it?  And snort it.  You don't know  if you can trust  the guy you're  buying it from.  Yep.  When you can't  trust your drug dealers.  If you want  the guy money,  he's just going  to kill you.  I was reading  about some of  the security measures  at the stadium.  Yeah.  Man, I stepped  all over your  great line, Gary.  I apologize.  No, it's okay, man.  It's all right.  I'm just saying,  the drug dealer  wants to get back  at you  because he didn't  pay you.  He grabbed the  Amfax and gave you  here.  Here's the coke.  Here's the coke.  Here's the coke.  I got you.  I got you.  I got you. 
[00:51:30]  Nippy.  Are you back?  Hey, Gary.  Have your parents  sat you down  like the news  tells the parents  to sit their kids  down and explain this?  Listen,  I go to school  and the day  that the September  11th happened,  my teacher told me  a widow was  sorry.  They said,  oh, we bombed  Afghanistan.  They had the  Twin Towers  because we bombed  them.  What?  And I live  out of Long Island.  Yeah.  In Babylon 
[00:52:00]  a little bit.  So what I heard  was because  I saw school  really early  with first period.  When you're telling  these little stories,  here's a good idea.  Have a point.  It makes it so much  more interesting  for the listener.  They bombed us  again.  We bombed them  again.  Then they hit  the Twin Towers  and hit the Pentagon.  Gary, Gary, Gary.  Have they sat  you down, though,  and given you  like this?  I don't have to.  My family  is getting sick.  I was the only  one that did not  get sick.  I was actually  laughing. 
[00:52:30]  I mean,  for your mental  health, you know,  it's kind of hard  for...  My mental health.  That's all right.  I didn't get,  you know...  Because sometimes  kids get very  scared of these  situations.  Not me.  I was actually  laughing because  I know we were  going to bomb them  and kill  mostly everybody.  You're a twisted  kid.  Thank you.  That's really  a compliment.  All right, Gary.  Cool, cool.  You're very funny.  Yes, I just  wanted to say  Norton,  Opie,  Anthony,  everybody there. 
[00:53:00]  Sorry for  yesterday's call.  Gary, Chris on  line 11 wants  you to repeat  after me, okay?  All right.  This house is  clean.  This house is  clean.  Say run  towards the line.  Have you ever  seen the movie  Poltergeist, Gary?  Yes.  You kind of  sound like that  little woman  that's in that  movie.  Really?  Say,  Carol Ann,  run  toward the  light.  Carol Ann,  run  toward the  light. 
[00:53:30]  He does  sound like  that.  Very funny.  Just on the  stage.  I'm sorry.  Norton,  I'm sorry.  All right,  repeat after me.  All right.  Stop touching  my dirty spot.  Now I'm  going to be  back.  All right,  we got to  go, Gary.  All right,  see you.  I look forward  to your phone  call on the  Ron and Fez  show tonight.  I might call.  Of course  you will.  Of course  I will.  See you, 
[00:54:00]  O&A Army.  All right.  See you.  Bye.  Let me go  to school.  Joe says,  I'm say,  mm-bop,  mm-bop,  mm-bop.  Now it's  mine.  Jason from  Washington checking  in from WJFK.  Hey, Jason,  what's up?  What's up,  fellas?  Hey, man.  How are you,  man?  All right,  man.  How are you?  We're doing  good.  Yeah,  I just want  to let you  guys know  we just got  our WOW  stickers finally.  Oh,  nice.  It looks  just like  the NEW  WOW  sticker  except we've  got our  JFK logo  on it,  which I  assume is  a cost-cutting 
[00:54:30]  measure on  our part.  Probably.  That's okay.  As long as  you have them.  I assume  they'll be  available for  people to  come by and  pick them up,  slap them on  the back of  doing that  next week.  We'll probably  get them out  there.  Things kind of  take a long  time around  here,  as you guys  know.  Sounds great.  Well,  I'm glad you  got the  WOW  stickers just  in time for  summer.  Thanks for  that.  Could they  do self-addressed  stamped envelopes?  Good question, 
[00:55:00]  Rick.  Oh,  geez.  Around here,  we're under  the Ken  Stevens regime  like you guys  are.  Yeah.  So,  I'm going to  hold off on  saying yes on  that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Probably  indefinitely.  All right.  Well,  okay.  Well,  they can  stop by  the station  next week  though and  get them.  Yeah,  we're in  Fairfax.  Everybody  around here  knows where  we are.  If they  listen to  the station,  they know  where we  are.  All right.  Thank you,  Jason.  All right,  fellas.  Peace.  Yeah,  send us some.  All right,  there you go.  And it's a  little odd  to be telling  people to mail  you stuff,  you know,  even a self-addressed 
[00:55:30]  stamped envelope.  A little risky  these days.  I haven't seen  one of those  in a while.  All our mail  here,  it's open  and then taped  that up,  man.  Have you been  reading about  this anthrax?  Yeah,  yeah.  You pretty much  can't see these  spores.  Right.  So these people  in the spacesuits  upstairs opening  up the mail  because they  are in spacesuits.  Yeah.  Are they just  quickly looking in  and go,  okay,  no anthrax spores  in here.  They're looking  for a little  masking tape 
[00:56:00]  and go,  this one's okay.  Yeah.  But in the  mailbox,  it's exactly  what they're doing.  First of all,  I think they're  looking for that  weird writing  that tapers off  to the right.  You know,  the spores are  so small.  I think you  were telling me  this yesterday.  They go right  through the  envelopes?  Smaller than  the pores.  If they're  processed the  right way,  which the  dashel envelope  or anthrax  was processed,  where it's  really tiny,  the spores,  and they don't  lump together.  That way they  can get into  your lungs  and kill you  better.  The spores  themselves,  smaller than  the pores, 
[00:56:30]  the natural  holes that are  in the paper  that make the  envelope.  So when they're  in these mail  sorting machines  and whatnot,  they're flying  out of the  envelope.  Every machine  they go through,  contaminated.  Other mail  that it's  touching,  contaminated.  The air  that the  envelope is  in,  if it's  shaking around  a little bit,  contaminated.  So at first,  I'm like,  oh, good.  So I went  through the  mail, you  know,  and they  were in a  safe environment.  They were  in the  spacesuits.  Safe  environment for  me,  fuck.  And I see  the mask  and tape.  I'm like,  okay,  you know, 
[00:57:00]  we could,  you know,  check out  this mail.  Yeah.  That doesn't  do crap.  No,  because it  could just  be on the  letter that's  inside there.  They're looking  for that weird  tapered off  writing.  They're looking  for a  September 11th  thing,  a la rules  you suck  thing.  You know,  that's what  they're looking  for.  But they  can't find  anthrax spores  on your mail,  so it's pretty  much worthless  what they're  doing.  But I guess 
[00:57:30]  they got to do  something.  Kind of makes  us feel a  little safer.  That's all  they can do  right now.  Do things,  put it out in  the news that  they're trying  to do things,  but the bottom  line,  they can't do  anything.  What happened  to Encephalitis?  What happened  to the Encephalitis  mosquito that  was killing  people?  Remember they  were spraying  the streets?  They were fogging  the streets  down.  Fogging them,  Norton!  They're fogging  the streets  down because  of these  mosquitoes stinging  people or  sucking their  blood and  people were  dropping dead  of this.  You remember?  They have  another confirmed  case of  encephalitis.  Someone's  hospitalized. 
[00:58:00]  Now,  no one  remembers.  What about  Gary Condit?  Gary Condit?  We were days  away from  arresting that  bastard.  There's still  an intern  missing.  You know  what I mean?  There's still  an intern  missing.  No one cares  about that.  Sharks.  How many  cities have  armed army  guys on  their streets?  Is it just  us in  Washington,  I'm assuming?  We didn't  see any in  Boston when  we were up  there.  No,  no.  Boston  security.  Oof.  Oof.  Ah.  Logan Airport, 
[00:58:30]  the Taliban's  military missile  base.  I had this  just in.  They just  dumped out  of Ufa.  Very funny  callback from  yesterday.  It's too bad  most of my  jokes are  over everyone's  head.  The problem  though with  the anthrax,  they can't do  anything about  it.  They can't do  anything.  We're doomed.  And do you  know something?  Do you think  they're going to  clean up all  the anthrax?  It seems to  me whatever  they test has  anthrax on  it.  If you get  to the point 
[00:59:00]  where you're  testing something,  it'll have  anthrax on  it.  Because the  stuff is all  over the  place now.  Gelman.  I don't know  what to do  with it.  But you've  just got to  live your  life, I  guess.  A cute  little  ditty.  The  Cipro  song.  We've got  a request  for this.  Cipro  mail.  We're all  going to die.  Open up  your mail  and we're  all going to  die.  Cipro  may not  be holistic  taking extra  doses,  but it's  the only  drug that  kills the  anthrax in 
[00:59:30]  your nose.  It's  Bin Laden  and his  kooky  gang  are  cowhead  crazy  iconic.  For  breakfast,  lunch,  and dinner,  we all  eat an  ibionics.  Open up  your mail  and we're  all going to  die.  Open up  your mail  and we're  all going to  die.  The  junk mail  you've  been  getting  could be  from the  Taliban.  I'll never  enter  sweepstakes  that I  get from  Ed McMahon.  This  anti-scare  has made  us all  a bunch  of  nervous  wrecks.  Just  wear your  gloves  and masks  when you  give  letters  from  FedEx.  Sending  anthrax in  our mail  will never 
[01:00:00]  be  forgotten.  Now  tell  Blue Cross  you need  this  drug  and  bill  it  to  Bin Laden.  Cipro  may not  be  holistic  but we  must  be  cautious.  It  kills  those  nasty  spores  so  that  you  won't  feel  so  damn  nauseous.  Cipro  kills  those  spores  so  that  you  won't  feel  so  damn  nauseous.  Thank you  Pretburger.  Bobby you're  next on the  O.P. and  Anthony show.  Hey how you  doing today guys?  Alright man.  Hey listen  that whole  anthrax spores  thing the  guys upstairs  are actually  doing the  right thing  right now. 
[01:00:30]  Being that  the anthrax  spores  the reason  that they're  trying to  make them  airborne  is they  got to  ground them  up and  mix them  with like  a talcum  powder.  So really  they're actually  helping you  guys out.  Making sure  that nobody's  trying to  send them  to you.  That's what  they're looking  for.  They're looking  to see if  they're mixed  with anything.  So they're  looking  alright  well of  course.  Yeah but you  guys are saying  that there's  nothing in  there.  We didn't  say there's  nothing in  there.  It doesn't  mean you  have to get  a letter  directly from  someone that's  mailing the  anthrax to  make it  dangerous. 
[01:01:00]  No you're  absolutely  right.  It could be  anywhere.  What we were  saying is  there still  could be  anthrax  spores in  our mail  even though  they went  through it.  You're  absolutely  right.  That's all  we're saying.  I mean I  know it's  much more  dangerous if  it's airborne  but we can  still get  the contact  one.  The cutaneous.  Thank you.  Yes.  No problem.  The only thing  I was saying  is because  every paper  that you  read tells  you something  different.  Right.  And one  paper I read  said that  one of the 
[01:01:30]  health guys  one of the  center for  disease control  guys said  that it's  nearly impossible  for you to  get anthrax  if your  letter came  in contact  with one  of them.  Oh really?  That's what  the New York  Post said  like a week  ago when I  was reading  it.  Well sure.  I believe  everything in  there.  Yeah you  got to believe  everything there  and on the  internet too.  Alright thank  you Bobby.  Thanks a lot  guys.  Cool.  You want to  hear a cool  little story  about what  the Taliban  is doing  to people  that have  served in  the alliance?  This one  guy has been  in a jail  cell because  he served  with the  alliance. 
[01:02:00]  He'd been  there 12  called out  his name  and said  he was  going to  be released  so they  threw him  in the back  of one  of their  pickup trucks  drove him  to...  Was it a  Toyota?  No it was  a Datsun  pickup.  Datsun?  Yeah Datsun.  Drove him  to the...  I thought  they hate  Americans.  Yeah that's  a Jap truck.  We make a lot  of them in  the United States  my friends.  Okay go ahead.  They began  driving me to  the Ghazi  Stadium.  You know what  happens at  the stadium.  I don't think  a sporting event 
[01:02:30]  has taken  place there in  years.  This is where  they do  their executions  and tortures  and what not.  So they're  driving me.  The guy thinks  he's going home?  Yeah.  He's in the  back of the  truck and he'll  go home now.  And he probably  hears the  crowd?  Yeah.  The noise  of the crowd?  Yeah because  they have a  bunch of  supporters that  go to this  stadium.  This is the  stadium.  You can find  videos on the  web and what  not of just  decapitations.  They do  firing squads.  They are all  in front of the  people to just  horrify them  into never  going against  the Taliban.  So he says 
[01:03:00]  at the beginning  I was silent.  But as we  neared I  asked what  is this?  What of my  release?  Then they told  him wait you  will be  released.  The Dotson  drove to the  center of the  stadium.  This guy  recalls thousands  of faces staring  at him in  silence from  the stands  and between  ten and  fourteen  moolahs on  chairs in a  line in the  middle of the  field.  He was pulled  from the truck  told to lie  spread eagle on  the grass.  The moolahs  didn't even ask 
[01:03:30]  my name or speak  to the crowd.  Seven doctors  approached me.  They wore  gray uniforms,  surgical masks  and gloves.  I could see  one was crying.  They injected  me.  After five  minutes my  body was  numb though  I was still  conscious.  They then  put clamps  on my hands  and foot  and began  to cut them  off with  special saws.  Not special  saws.  But this guy  obviously lives.  Yeah.  He's telling  about it.  Yeah.  This was  there was  no pain  but I 
[01:04:00]  could see  what they  were doing.  I asked  him if  he oh  this is a  reporter now  talking to  the guy  I asked  him if  he stared  at the  sky.  He told  me he  was  transfixed  by the  sight of  his foot  being  removed.  Ouch.  There was  a sigh and  a murmur  from the  crowd when  they finished.  It had  taken about  five minutes.  And it  was  Louis  Black.  Yes.  Taliban  guards  threw 
[01:04:30]  the guy  in the  back  of  the  pickup.  One  was  crying  too.  Nothing  was  said.  Even  now I  am  unaware  why  I  was  chosen  for  amputation.  That's  what they  do.  They might  kill you.  They might  just take  you to  the  sports  complex,  shoot  you up  with  some  Novocaine  and cut  your  limbs  off.  That's  who  are  fighting.  Oh man.  I thought  you were  talking about  the  Diamondbacks  manager  after he  took  Curt Schilling  out.  Oh wait  I didn't  even notice.  This is  sportsillustrated.com.  I thought  I was on  a news 
[01:05:00]  site.  That's  Bob  Brindley  right?  Yeah.  Alright.  Oh man.  One more  about Anthrax  in the  mail and  we'll move  on to  other  things.  Ant wants  to talk  about  the  Jenny  Jones  show.  Jenny  Jones.  After  we take  a break.  Justin  what's  up?  Yeah.  One of  your loyal  30 listeners  down here  in D.C.  We have  more than  that.  We know  that.  What are  you up  to 35?  A couple  hundred.  We're  working on  a couple  of that.  That's  cool.  Growing  by leaps  and bounds.  I work  the mail  here for 
[01:05:30]  where I  work and  one thing  that we  came up  with that  seems to  work pretty  well is  a nice  little bleach  water in  a spray  bottle.  Makes  your mail  stink like  hell and  it stains  it but  it's  guaranteed to  kill  whatever  anthrax  fails you.  What if  you're getting  something in  the mail  that can't  have bleach  on it?  Like what?  What about  all the people  ironing their  mail and then  their mail  explodes?  Yeah they're  starting on  fire.  It's certainly  better than  microwaving your  mail for 20  minutes and  watching your  mail and  the microwave  catch on  fire. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah that's  always good.  Microwave your  mail.  That won't  start fires.  More people  will die in  fires than  anthrax.  Alright.  Thank you Dustin.  Have a good  one.  Okay.  Once again  a couple pairs  of tickets to  the World Series  tonight at Yankee  Stadium.  We're giving  them away  today.  You have  from now  until 530  to get  outside the  Brooklyn Diner  57th between  7th and  Broadway.  We're going to  have a bunch  of people out  there.  Then we're  going to  have a  megaphone and  either Rick or  maybe one of  us or both of  us will figure it 
[01:06:30]  out and we're  going to tell  you what you  have to do for  the Yankee  tickets for  tonight's game.  Two pairs.  There you go.  One hour to go  to get down there.  We extended it  because a lot of  people were getting  out of work at  five.  Okay?  Huge ticket.  And the tickets  are courtesy of  Budweiser.  The King of  Beers.  All right,  Lisa.  What?  And the NHL.  Oh, no.  Major League Baseball,  of course.  Major League Baseball. 
[01:07:00]  It's O.P.  and Anthony.  Don't be an  a-hole.  You seem a little  drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself,  okay.  And we're back  with the O.P.  and Anthony  show.  The crowd is  starting to form  outside the  station, Anthony,  for their chance  to win Yankee  tickets, World  Series tickets  tonight.  A couple pairs  of tickets to  give away, yes,  courtesy of Budweiser.  So we're asking  people to show up  at the station  by 530 and then  we'll tell you what 
[01:07:30]  you have to do  for the tickets,  okay?  Right.  We're at 57th  between 7th and  Broadway.  There's a guy,  or a couple guys  outside.  They're in a  pinstripe Rolls  Royce.  Oh, yeah.  Vinny, what's  going on?  Hey, how you  doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  We got Yankee  fever.  Yankee fever.  Is that from  opening mail?  Yankee fever on  you.  So you're waiting  outside the station?  Yeah.  Let's see what's 
[01:08:00]  going on down  here.  We're just cruising  around the city.  Cool.  We got about 45  minutes and then  we'll tell everyone  what they have to do  for the Yankee tickets.  We got two pairs,  all right?  All right.  Who am I talking  to?  Opie.  Oh, okay.  Anthony used to  work.  Am I on or no?  All right, Vinny.  Thanks a lot.  Vinny, we'll be  out there soon.  Okay.  This is going to  go into some  long story about  I guess where I  used to work.  Fascinating stuff.  I believe we cut  our losses nicely  there.  Very good.  Hey, is P-Boy  around today? 
[01:08:30]  Maybe we can get  him in a little  while.  I want to see how  his Halloween went.  I'm sure he  went trick-or-treating.  Went trick-or-treating.  I'm sure he could  eat whatever he  wants.  He's a normal kid.  So, you know,  normal kids go  trick-or-treating.  Normal kids.  Oh, sure.  We'll see if we can  get him in here in a  few minutes.  Chris, what's going  on?  Hey, you guys see the  Jenny Jones show  today?  Yeah, that's what we  wanted to talk about.  Yeah, teen strippers.  Yeah, here's the  premise, Opie.  Jenny Jones gets  people to come out 
[01:09:00]  and talk about how  horrible one of their  relatives are, either a  daughter, sister,  whatever, that is  stripping.  She's teen, you know,  anywhere from 13 up to  17, stripping, and  these people are very  annoyed.  Another teen show.  Another teen show on  Jenny Jones.  So, Jenny, of course,  and the audience  there, just getting  all pissed off at the  people that are  stripping and getting  pissed off at the  parents saying they 
[01:09:30]  should do something.  And this is horrible.  At one point, I'm  sitting there.  They drag out this  17-year-old chick.  Hot.  Did you see the  17-year-old one?  I missed the first  half hour or so.  I think this was  toward the end.  They had this guy.  He was 40 years old.  The father.  The tall girl?  Of this girl.  Yeah, the one with  the dark hair.  Yeah, that's on her.  She's wearing little  shorts and a bikini  top?  Yep.  Holy hot.  I couldn't take my  eyes off her crotch.  I'm like camel toe  going on.  And she's stripping.  And she's stripping. 
[01:10:00]  And the mom's right  there?  No, the mom isn't  there.  The father was there.  And they had been  estranged from each  other.  Now the father's all  pissed off.  She's trying to become  an emancipated child.  And she loves drugs.  She's saying, I love  the coke.  I love everything.  She's partying.  She's stripping.  And what does she  strip for?  Uh, friends.  And at bachelor  parties and whatnot.  And she makes some  cash.  You know, she's like,  I'm going to put  myself through college.  Then they had some  fat 16-year-old white  chick that just was 
[01:10:30]  talking like a black  chick.  With the stretch marks  on her stomach?  Oh!  She's like, I'll make  time for my child.  And she's whiter than  white.  I mean, pale white.  Her sister is sitting  there going, you don't  take care of your child.  And I was, if I was in  the audience, I'd go,  excuse me, why do you  talk like black chicks?  What, what are you  doing?  Why do you talk like,  no one ever asked that  question.  Well, let's, let me tell  you something.  I look good and I dance.  I'm 16, but I've been  with more men than you. 
[01:11:00]  It's like, what?  She's this backward, uh,  backwards white chick who,  I, I don't know who's  paying her to strip.  What a slob she was.  Then the best part.  Here it is.  Here's the despicableness  of Jenny Jones and all  these talk shows.  The whole premise is how  horrid it is that these  young girls are stripping.  They go backstage.  They have that backstage  cam where they talk about  the girl outside.  Then you see the girl  backstage mouthing off to  the camera and saying,  uh, uh, and dancing. 
[01:11:30]  13 year old.  Is this before, uh, she  went to bootcamp?  Yeah, I guess that's how  they try to remedy the  whole thing.  They sent her to the  bootcamp, but that's more  of a Sally, Jesse,  Raphael thing.  Or a Maury.  Maury.  We're going to bootcamp.  You sent her to bootcamp  for two hours.  Ooh.  Yeah, ooh, that'll solve  the problem.  Like, these kids aren't  beat up enough.  So, uh, a 13 year old  backstage.  And not one of those  13 year olds where you  go, wow, she looks, you  know, 18.  13 looking like she's 10  or 11.  Dressed in this little  halter top and shorts. 
[01:12:00]  Shaking her ass and, uh,  dancing for the camera.  As they're talking about  how horrible it is that  she's, uh, doing something  like this, dancing for her  19 year old brother's  friends.  And, uh, the mother  supports this.  The mother supports  this?  The mother's sitting  outside.  She goes, I support it.  I know where she is.  And it's not like she's  taking her clothes off.  She just dances for her  brother's friends.  But they were showing  the hot outfit that she  dances in probably, right?  She's dancing in this,  yeah, little, little  shorts and, and, uh, 
[01:12:30]  halter top thing.  So, she comes out and  the whole audience booing  her, booing her, you know,  and she's like, you, you  don't know me, that  whole act, and Jenny  Jones sitting there on  her high horse, uh,  talking about how awful  this is.  Meanwhile, think about  it.  I wouldn't know this  girl, uh, was out  there.  I wouldn't have seen  her dancing in her  little shorts and  halter top if she  hadn't been booked to  do that exact thing on  the Jenny Jones show.  And they made sure  they got a good shot  of her strutting her  stuff backstage.  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, it wasn't just  talking about it and  sitting her down and  making sure you don't  come on this show unless  you're dressed appropriately  for a girl that age.  No.  They tell her, make  sure she's dressed in  the same stuff she  dances in.  Put her backstage.  Okay, the camera's  going to be on you.  We're going live.  You make sure you  dance just like you  dance for the 19-year-old  boys.  It's under the guise of  helping, uh, this  situation out.  Now, we've caught  flack.  Shows, uh, uh, like  our show catches flack  for exploitation by some 
[01:13:30]  of the same people.  You'd get a Jenny  Jones talking about  this show, how awful,  oh, we're exploiting,  and people are  exploiting these girls.  No, there's no  ulterior motive.  You know what I mean?  This isn't where us  going on and doing that  and saying we're doing  it to maybe cure  colon cancer.  Oh, we know what  we're doing.  We know what we're  doing.  The people know what  they're getting.  There's no excuse.  Basically, what you're  saying is we don't fake  it.  Right.  Like Jenny Jones is  making believe they  really care when, uh,  the reality is they  don't and they just  want to, you know,  make sure they get,  uh, some nice,  nice, uh,  ratings from these shows. 
[01:14:00]  We know teen girls  hot and we know  bring them on the  show.  It rules.  They know the same  thing, but Bob is  saying a lot of  women that they're,  uh, they play dance  music when the girls  come out and stuff.  Hell yeah.  Oh man.  And the girls are  strutting that some of  these girls are strutting  they're not even  developed chests.  Uh, like they're  strippers.  And then the brother  comes out of this  13 year old girl.  The mother is sitting  on the couch supporting  her 13 year old for  dancing.  The brother comes out 
[01:14:30]  and he, uh, I guess,  uh, is, uh, he was  half black, half white.  The mother's white  and the father, I  don't know where he  was, but you could  tell from the children  that he was a black  guy.  Uh, he comes out like  he's pimping his 13  year old sister now.  She can do a pole dance.  Uh, she struts us  stuff.  You like what you see.  He's pointing at her  ass.  You like what you see.  Uh huh.  That's the body, man.  That's it.  So what was Jenny  Jones doing?  I, I hate to say  this.  The brother was all  dirty from our show.  It was Lorenzo, which 
[01:15:00]  I'm embarrassed to say,  but Jenny Jones is not  even saying she's, she's  in the audience holding  the mic with that  concerned twat face on  like this is horrible.  How do you support  this?  You're showing it.  You have this underage  girl parading around  half naked dancing to  dance music on your  show.  She's doing the exact  same thing for a  national audience, but  yet she's outraged at  the whole thing.  What a bitch. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, please.  Would we have her on  this show?  You're damn right we  would.  Oh, Jenny Jones or  the 13 year old  stripper?  We've kept it legal.  Barely.  Well, when we say teens,  we do mean 18 and 19.  She's getting 13 year  old girls dancing around.  No, actually it depends  on what state we're in.  Right.  True.  Why don't people come  down on Jenny Jones and  go, oh my God, you've got  a 13 year old girl shaking  her ass.  Fran, what's going on?  Yeah. 
[01:16:00]  It could have been worse.  It could have been one of  those my teenagers kicking  my ass episodes every day  that they saw on every show.  That is a funny one, man,  when you see the mother.  You ever see like the  little like nine year old  nine year old four foot  nothing, 90 nothing pounds  and the mom's like the  300 pound trailer park mom  and the kids go, shut up,  shut up, you don't know me.  Whoa, yeah, I'm the  toughest moleful in the  universe.  That's like the funniest  thing.  I mean, I love those  episodes where they're  sitting down and go,  Janet, I got to tell you  just the other day I was  doing the laundry and 
[01:16:30]  little Joe Bob snuck up  behind me and hit me in  the head with the  baseball bat and the  whole thing was going  ooh, ooh, ooh.  And then the little kid  just stands up and he's  like, I don't care, I'll  do it again.  And I got projuria.  It's a cape right here.  You ever watch like  morning when he has  like those kids that  like, like the other  day you were talking  about the kid who's  like eight and he's  like, looks like 90.  Yeah, yeah, the  little projuria kid.  Yeah.  We call him a  girl with the face and 
[01:17:00]  her face has got like  Michael Jackson, Vito  I go.  Oh, the freak show  episodes that are also  helping.  Yeah, every day it's  either, Maury's either  got, Maury or Jenny or  Sally or like the  lesser class ones like  the just springers.  Yeah.  Maury's got the trail  park trash five, like  this morning.  Maury is more for the  freak shows.  Yeah.  How about like, I used  to be fine, I used to be  a geek, now I'm fine,  and everybody stole from  Jenny or Ricky.  That's a Ricky one.  I don't even watch  Ricky anymore because  it's all paternity  tests and.  Yeah.  How about the 300 pound 
[01:17:30]  girls who think they  look like Stephanie  McMahon?  Yeah, when they come  out and they're dressed  and everyone boos and  they go, you know you  want it.  And they're holding  their arms, I swear,  right on their hips and  their hands are three  feet apart.  Yeah.  And they're just  shaking it.  You know you want  it.  Oh, shut up.  Shut up.  You know you want  it.  You look a little  like, I don't know,  you look like when  you're like, like  M.A. from like  Fashion Emergency, I  can believe in  because she's  beautiful.  But when you look  like, when you look  like the big show  and you're a female  and you're 500 pounds 
[01:18:00]  and you're like.  Yeah, I know.  Let him walk out  to a mole on your  hip and you can  show it.  See, I can't believe  people are still  watching these shows.  I gave up on them  well over a year.  You know what it is?  I think spring of  this morning I didn't  watch all these shows  because I'm like,  I'm more of a  soap guy.  Yeah.  But, you know,  I'm more of a  wrestling slash soap  guy because basically  it's the same thing,  soap opera.  But, like, they  had this guy who  was like, like,  Andre the Giant  at his worst  times three.  And the woman  looked like King  Kong Bundy 
[01:18:30]  times two.  Yeah.  And, you don't  eat that chicken.  I'll leave you alone.  See what I mean?  No, listen.  He's eating the chicken.  All right.  All right.  This guy's giving me  a headache for some  reason, Opie.  Sorry.  No, you did well  until the end there.  I'm sorry.  It's just like,  you know, like,  those talk shows.  You've got to know  when to wrap it up.  Yeah, yeah.  Wrap it up.  We don't need a description.  I'm a long-time fan,  first-time caller.  Quack, quack, quack,  quack, quack, quack.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, there are  different versions  of the show.  There's the Jerry Springer,  which is the fake 
[01:19:00]  fighting now,  so I'm not really  into that.  It was cool when they  used to really punch  people in the face  on that show,  but that's gone,  so that sucks.  But he usually has  the white trash  relationship problems.  Jenny and Sally  love the teen girls.  Jenny, it's just  all about the sex.  Sally occasionally  gets the women.  You still watch  regularly.  I know the shows.  And Maury makes  believe,  I know this much,  because I take a peek  at Maury every once  in a while.  He makes believe  he really cares  about the people  that are on the stage.  That Maury, 
[01:19:30]  probably the most  despicable.  The sex ones,  yeah, you know  what you're getting  into there.  The Maury ones,  Maury, day after day,  will do child freak  shows where he brings  kids that you know  are just effed up,  legless children.  Kids that,  oh, this was  always a good one.  And in a couple  of minutes,  young Billy's going  to come out,  his father doused  him in gasoline  and threw a lighter  on him,  and he was burnt  on 100% of his body,  third degree burns.  We're going to bring  him out here 
[01:20:00]  and throw him  a little party.  And you're just like,  so don't go anywhere.  And now you're not,  because you've got to  see what the hell  this is like.  You know that kid  is self-conscious.  He probably can't even  look at himself  in the mirror.  He's going to show  that face and his body  to millions on TV.  And then Maury does  the thing where he gets  real close to him,  holds the hand,  gets so close,  like two inches  from the face  and goes,  you know,  you're a special child  and we're going  to do something  for you today.  And the audience  is just,  aw, aw.  But he doesn't care. 
[01:20:30]  Let's roll Timmy in.  He's just a head.  He's a head on a gurney,  but he's,  you're a special head.  How are my ratings?  Check him.  Check him as the...  Check the mid-show ratings  because we might have  to go to another freak.  Check him as the head  rolls onto the stage.  Are we doing better?  Don't make me bring  out Vag Girl.  It's just a vag  with a beating heart.  I was saving it  for sweeps,  but case of emergency.  Break glass.  Break glass.  And there is where  you will find,  like,  the P-Boy kids  where they bring  them out in a gaggle. 
[01:21:00]  Oh,  they'll get like  five or six of them.  Then Maury,  you know,  and we're going  to give your parents  a minivan.  Cart you around  or someone check  the audience.  Are they crying yet?  No?  All right,  bring another one out.  Not enough tears?  Let them talk about  how if the barometric  pressure gets too high  his head caves in.  Can we talk about that?  Get the audience crying.  Give them some free  gift certificates  for a restaurant  in Times Square.  I got to go home  and bank honey.  You're a special kid. 
[01:21:30]  You're a special kid.  And even though  your nose cracked off  during the show,  you're a special child.  I know that, Maury.  Thank you, Maury,  for caring about me.  But I'm a normal kid.  Oh,  I'm a normal kid.  And, you know, Maury,  I just want to say  it's a dream come true  to be on...  All right,  we'll be back  right after this  with Colin Man.  Find out why  he's called Colin Man.  But, Maury,  you said you...  Shut up,  you little raisin.  Look at you.  It's like someone  left you out 
[01:22:00]  on a tarp  in the sun.  But, Maury,  you said you cared  about me.  I did,  but the show's over, kid.  Look,  I can see your pulse  through your rolling  paper-thin skull.  You need to realize  not all the baby turtles  make it to the ocean.  Move on.  Sometimes the seagulls  get them.  That's right.  Sometimes they flop around.  Seagull gets them,  snaps their little neck.  That's nature.  Look at this skull. 
[01:22:30]  It's like a helium balloon  a kid took home  after, like,  three days.  Joey, what's up?  Hey, I'm about to  hop back on Jenny.  I did see that today.  She's pretty much the pig,  but she,  did they coach  the girls backstage?  I mean,  they all come right out  going, you know,  oh, what, what, what?  Oh, don't hate,  don't hate, don't hate.  You know they are  told what to do  to titillate the crowd.  And Jenny Jones,  the producers,  they know that show.  They don't want surprises. 
[01:23:00]  So when those girls  are dancing backstage,  the guy at the camera  is telling them,  shake it,  you're on,  shake it, shake it.  Because sometimes  you see the girls,  they're just standing there,  they're doing nothing  when they cut to that shot,  and all of a sudden  they look off camera  and then they go,  oh, and then they start dancing.  Like they've just been  shaking their little asses  the whole time.  But Jenny is good  for one thing, though.  Three out of five days  of the week,  she always has the,  the good girls,  the bad girls,  they'll look at me now,  and they always come on  with these tremendous cans,  and it's awesome.  Yeah.  Three days out of the week,  she's good.  The other two days,  but the fat teen girls, 
[01:23:30]  always funny,  but then they'll get  the ringer hot chick in there,  and then the makeover shows  are great.  You know,  I've got to stop,  because I want to make sure  people understand this.  You know,  it's exploitation.  We understand that.  We do exploit  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, hell,  we love it.  But we don't fake it.  Like these talk shows,  they exploit,  but then make believe  they're trying to do some good  to bring the shrink out  at the end of the show  to tell why they're doing this  and how the parents  can stop doing it. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, please.  Pretend she cares.  She gets so many guests on,  they spend about one minute.  Oh, here's a little,  you know,  what's her face?  She's beating the crap  out of her mother.  What's your name?  They don't care.  Oh, next.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  You don't know me.  And then they know  the ones that have done well,  and then Sally Jessie's  great for this one.  We're going to revisit  with this one.  Three months ago,  she was on our show,  and the ratings went  through the roof  because she showed  so much camel toe  that we're bringing her back.  And then they bring  back the bad girl.  Yep.  Oh, I love the bad girl show. 
[01:24:30]  You know,  I used to go to a lot  of those shows  when they were really hot.  Rick was on one.  When are you going  to bring that tape in  from your Rolanda appearance?  Rick was on Rolanda.  Rolanda?  Rolanda telling the whole world  that he was never going  to get married  because he didn't believe  in it because his grandfather  had 50 kids.  Were you on the...  Were you on it?  It was in Menaxe.  No.  It was me, Dave.  It was Rick.  Anyway, I went to see Montel once.  You went to a Montel taping.  And it was hilarious  because, I mean,  you just described it  to a team, man. 
[01:25:00]  They had some teary-eyed thing  going on on the stage.  Yeah.  And he was milking it  for all it's worth.  Of course.  And then the camera stopped  to play some commercials.  He starts yelling  and screaming at his crew  that there's lint  on his...  On his jacket?  On his jacket.  He stopped like that.  Of course.  On a dime.  We'll, um...  We'll be right back.  And the staff,  I'll never forget it,  they were petrified  of this guy  and they're running out.  I'm sure.  There was, like,  two girls working  over his coat jacket  with a lint brush. 
[01:25:30]  And then we got back  from the commercial break  or whatever  and then it was back  to get the teary-eyed  stuff on stage.  And, um...  That's such a touching story.  Will...  Will...  We'll be right back  after these words.  All right, Montel,  we're clear in the spot.  Why the hell  is there lint  on my goddamn jacket?  I don't care  if this disabled cracker 
[01:26:00]  get me a cracker.  I don't need lint  on my goddamn jacket.  And we're back.  We're right back  from a touching story.  All right,  we have to take a break.  Now, Montel's  going to come out.  We need a big hand.  I'm Paul Mercurio,  everyone.  When Montel comes back,  please don't point out  lint on his jacket.  Makes him angry.  You're part of the show.  Remember,  if you see lint  on Montel,  please pick it off.  Okay?  Thank you. 
[01:26:30]  I'm Paul Mercurio.  Paul's coming in  tomorrow, I think.  I love Paul, man.  All right, here's the deal.  A couple things  really fast  as we take a break.  Don't forget to vote  for the Booba Lantern  contest that is still  going on.  We're going to announce  a winner at the end  of the show tomorrow.  Yes.  You go to  opianthony.com  to see the contestants  and vote for your favorite.  We got three prizes.  First place,  $1,000, Anthony.  Nice.  Also, you have only  a half hour left  to get outside the station.  We're talking right now.  Half hour from right now. 
[01:27:00]  57th, between Broadway  and 7th Avenue,  outside the Brooklyn Diner.  Hopefully, we got a group  of people out there by now.  We got two pairs of tickets  to tonight's game  at the stadium.  World Series tickets  courtesy of Budweiser.  At 5.30,  Rick and the gang  are going downstairs  and they're going to tell you  what you have to do  to win the Yankee tickets  for tonight's game.  And we'll have it all  live on the radio, okay?  Right.  So, 5.30,  that is it.  So, get your asses  to the Brooklyn Diner  between 57th,  on 57th,  between 7th and Broadway.  Okay? 
[01:27:30]  Cool.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Nude teen.  Oh, man,  I want to get in her pants.  What did you just say?  Nude teen.  Oh, man,  I want to get in her pants.  Call 911.  Hopey and Anthony.  Home of nude teens.  I don't know how  this show  made it past the censors.  Right when you think  we've gotten as sick  as we possibly can,  we take it to  just about illegal.  Daddy,  I love when you touch  my bad place.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:28:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Rick and the gang have  left the building, Anthony.  Ah, yes,  going downstairs.  Going downstairs,  heading outside.  We're going to give away  two pairs of tickets  to the Yankee game tonight  at the stadium.  The World Series.  Yeah, I know.  Courtesy of Budweiser.  We're asking people  to show up at the  Brooklyn Diner  on 57th  between 7th and Broadway.  And right around 530,  we'll tell you  what you have to do  for the Yankee tickets.  We've got two pairs.  So if you're in the area,  start heading on over. 
[01:28:30]  Can't wait to get them  on the phone.  I want to hear  what kind of crowd's down there.  As soon as Rick  gets down there,  we'll have them call in.  Amy,  very pissed off,  Ann.  Amy,  what's up?  I'm really pissed off.  You know,  these people come  on Maury's show  because they have problems.  And y'all can get on the air  and talk about them.  What's wrong with you?  Like,  so you think  Maury's doing some help  for them,  helping them out?  Well,  he's trying to make them  feel better.  Amy,  you really think  that's why Maury's doing that?  Yeah,  how is Maury helping 
[01:29:00]  these people?  Well,  like,  not too long ago,  there was a little boy  on there  that had a disease.  What was the disease?  I don't know.  He was a miniature  for his age.  He wasn't old,  was he?  Was he in a little body  that looked like an old man  only he was nine years old?  Yes.  Yes,  exactly.  Yeah,  that was me.  Yeah,  right.  Did I have a big  light bulb head?  Stop making fun of him.  What's wrong with you?  Why do you want to do that? 
[01:29:30]  Did I have a big  light bulb head  that was just about  as fragile as a light bulb?  You did not have a light bulb head,  okay?  Have little fingers.  as brittle as pretzel rods?  You are so mean.  What is wrong with you?  No,  me.  You do not have anything  better to do with your time  than talk about people  in the air?  Amy,  we speak the truth.  Let me tell you something.  What is the disease?  Pejoria.  Pejoria disease?  That is like,  that is the diamond  in the rough 
[01:30:00]  for these talk shows.  They love it  because it's a rare find.  Yeah,  there's not many  of those kids around.  That is very rare  and it's big ratings  for these talk shows.  You've got to be kidding  if you think  he's parading them  on the stage  because he's trying  to help these kids.  Well,  he must be  if he's willing  to carry them  on Disney World  and give them things.  Come on.  Why will he do that?  Small price to pay.  You send the kid  down to Disney World  and your ratings  go through the roof.  Figure it out.  He's not freaky  looking enough.  Get me one  that has those buck teeth  that look like  the big white chicklets.  Not the little mini ones, 
[01:30:30]  the big ones.  I just think  that's very wrong  and you should not  be doing things like that.  And Amy,  I say that you're  really stupid  and naive  that you don't get  what's going on  for one,  I am not stupid  and I'm not naive.  Like I said,  you're stupid  and naive.  Did I look like  a big scary  pay dispenser?  Listen,  y'all are too  cock-a-doo  with yourself.  Oh,  look at you.  You're a little potty-mouthed.  You're a little potty-  You're a little potty-mouthed,  Amy.  Amy,  you're a little  potty-mouthed bitch 
[01:31:00]  and I love it.  I'm a bitch.  Excuse me?  Talk dirty.  Talk dirty,  you little hooah.  Did you pump out  one of these  distorted kids?  What happened?  Yeah,  right.  Did your stepdad  get you pregnant  when he was banging you  and you pumped out  a freak kid?  Is that what happened,  Amy?  I have two beautiful  children,  thank you.  Nothing is wrong  with my children.  What's the matter?  Are they mental cases?  Did you have a little  perjurya kid  that you really  had to squeeze  to get that huge  head through?  Is that what happened,  Amy?  Y'all are retarded, 
[01:31:30]  okay?  Y'all are so retarded.  You have a big-tongued  kid with a mohair cut?  Amy,  you truly are stupid  if you don't get  what the talk shows do.  Uh-huh.  Two beautiful children  that should beat  their mother.  The freakier,  the better.  That's what happens  on these talk shows.  That's what happens  with the Jerry Lewis  telethon as well.  Right.  They wheel the freaks  out for money.  Isn't that right, Amy?  Y'all are so stupid,  okay?  Y'all are so stupid.  Y'all are so stupid.  Y'all don't even know  what it's all about.  Y'all are the right  to get on the air  and talk about people  like that.  Shut up. 
[01:32:00]  You shut up.  I'll beat you again.  You stupid.  Well,  she had the one child  for me  and then the other  one's Arlo's.  But let me tell you  something.  You.  I'll take care  of my kids.  You're just a stupid  concrete walker.  See,  we're the city folk now  that does that  like wearing shoes  and stuff  and all that city stuff  and walking on pavement.  You,  Eric Crumby,  and fish,  moron. 
[01:32:30]  Hang the phone up,  you skank.  The little one's got  what they call  the wall around the brain.  I know.  You didn't just  call me a skank.  Hang the phone up,  you skank.  You're the skank,  okay?  Hang the phone up,  you skank.  Well,  hang it up.  There you go.  There she goes.  She's talking  to a recording.  One of our friends,  Amy.  Wow.  She was fun. 
[01:33:00]  You concrete walker.  Well,  I was with Amy  back in  the sixth grade  when we,  when I dropped out  and I've been working  at the garage  to take care  of the kids.  Ugh.  Die,  get in a club,  and die.  I love when girls  call up like that.  You're terrible.  Shut up.  You're stupid.  Shut up.  And then she's 
[01:33:30]  defending a show  that does worse.  She's pissed at us  because we spell it out  like it really is.  If we're talking  about kids  that have the  pejoria  and we're goofing  on it on this show,  we're awful.  But Maury's doing  the same goddamn thing  and it's worse  because he's doing it  under a lie.  Like he's trying  to help.  Please.  Don't even care.  And like you said,  those pejoria kids  are a rare find.  Ah,  we're diamonds in the rough.  Well,  the lifespan's very short.  Lifespan short 
[01:34:00]  so it's not like  you can have  repeated appearances on.  Not many around.  What about  the famous  Siamese twin chicks?  Oh,  God damn,  you're right.  Maury did that too.  Help me out.  Connected at the head.  Connected at the head  and then  under the guise  that, you know,  it's all cute and fun,  the one wanted to be  a country singer.  A country,  a country western singer  and they had her  sing a song  while her sister's  attached to her head  and everyone,  the stupid rubes  in the audience,  they didn't even have 
[01:34:30]  the balls to say  this is ridiculous.  They're all clapping  like,  oh wow,  she does have talent.  I think we're going  to get you a record deal.  No one will notice  that her sister's  attached to her head  and her sister  hates country western music  but she likes to shop  in the mall  so that's the trade-off  because the other girl  doesn't like to shop.  Hey,  let's show them footage  in the mall shopping,  everyone.  You're just two regular girls,  aren't you?  Right.  You know what the sad  is?  Are you hoping to get  a boyfriend?  Shut up!  You got a boyfriend?  Yeah,  your hair looks  really pretty 
[01:35:00]  when they tell him  stuff like that.  It's awful.  These two were connected  at the face.  Remember that?  They were connected  like by eye sockets  and skulls so that  when you're looking  at one,  you're looking  at the back  of the head  of the other.  Dude,  when you looked  at the Isami twins,  you wanted to puke.  It was so frightening.  It was really,  really frightening  to look at.  They're making believe  that they're beautiful  and do you have  boyfriends?  No,  but we're hoping  someday to get married.  People who are  watching today 
[01:35:30]  might want to  call up and have a date.  Oh,  who the hell  am I kidding?  This is horrific,  isn't it,  people?  But,  of course,  the talk shows.  They have them on  because they're doing good.  Yeah.  Of course.  That's what it is.  I'm the stupid moron.  I forgot.  Her dream's to be  a country western singer.  Who are we to stand  in our way?  Oh,  Maury.  Bring her out  on the Maury show.  I want to ask  how you wash  that connected eye socket.  I know that's a question 
[01:36:00]  everyone is really  wondering about.  And the one is so stupid  she really thinks  she could be a  country western singer.  So,  all these bars,  they book her.  Oh,  yeah.  They're not booking her  because she sings well.  It's like,  holy ass,  we got the freak show  in our bar tonight.  Look at this.  Come on down.  Connected at the face,  chicks.  Budweiser,  two for a dollar.  Come on down.  Bring all your friends.  And then the other one  is all pissed off  because,  oh,  you know,  this is her dream  so I have to go,  you know,  I have to hang out.  Gotta go along,  yeah.  Like,  you know,  I hate country western music. 
[01:36:30]  The best was the hairstyles.  The one  dyed her hair  a different color.  I don't,  you know,  it might not be more.  That's what sucks.  One of those tools  are like,  oh,  look at your hair.  Were you at the beauty parlor  before you came over here today?  Beauty parlor?  I just did my hair.  I'm glad you noticed.  One of them dyed her hair  a different color  and just picked a spot  on their heads  where she felt  the Mason Dixon line,  should be.  She figured  her hair officially  ends in the other one's stars  and just didn't touch  the rest of it.  So one has this  blonde straight hair, 
[01:37:00]  the other one's going  with the basic brown  mousy kind of curly thing.  with that borderline  down her head.  And the one  was cursed with legs  and the other one,  you know,  she has to wheel  the other one around  that's placed on the gurney.  But they're doing it  to help the poor kids.  And you know,  you're special girls.  I don't want anyone  telling you  you're not special girls.  He gets real close,  holds their hand.  You know something? 
[01:37:30]  The courage  you girls have,  it just...  We'll be right back.  What a great freak show.  All right.  Wheel this piece of...  Wheel this four-legged  piece of crap  off my stage.  Get this connected  at the head freak  mess off my stage.  All right,  we're in commercials.  You are disgusting messes.  You know,  and Lou makes a great...  I should let Lou do it. 
[01:38:00]  Lou, what's up?  Hi.  I just wanted to know  if Maury Povich...  Wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  If Maury Povich...  Wait, wait, wait.  Slow down.  I said Lou.  This is Lou.  Oh, her name's Lou.  Louise or something?  Lupita.  Lupita?  Lupita.  You got some  of that Hispanic blood  in you.  Mexican.  The Mexicans.  Yes, this is good.  I love the Mexicans.  All right, go ahead, Lou.  If Maury Povich  really cares about  these children,  then why did he adopt  a perfectly normal child? 
[01:38:30]  Bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.  Yeah, if you really care  and want to do something.  Exactly.  Show everybody your causes  and what really matters to you.  You know,  I don't care that he does  this type of programming.  I got to keep saying it,  but let's not make believe  that you're doing it  for this reason  when you're actually doing it  for ratings.  I love you guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  I wanted to adopt  a six-headed mongloid freak,  but Connie wasn't into it. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Bunch of hypocrites.  What about the other  Sarnie's twins?  They, they,  what are you laughing at?  You got to be talking  about crab guys.  The crab guys.  Crab guys.  I knew you were going  to talk about crab guys.  Crab guys.  I think they were  from Chicago.  They rocked.  This is the sickest,  freakiest thing.  And the goddamn  PC people out there,  ruined their careers.  Yeah.  Totally.  This is something else  that has to be brought up.  I think it was  the HBO show Freaks.  Freaks.  Because they had  the half woman.  Remember the half woman?  Yeah. 
[01:39:30]  I know I'm all over  the place now.  I love half woman.  Half woman was basically  cut right below her boobs.  The sternum.  Yeah.  Belly button,  let's say.  There was nothing there.  No, no parts.  She had no sexual organs  whatsoever.  It was about the belly button.  And that was it.  She walked on her hands  and her stump body  only came down  to her elbow.  They showed her  she was a checkout girl  at the local supermarket  because she can't work  the freak shows anymore.  That's right.  And she was cursing  the politically correct 
[01:40:00]  people out there.  Because they went  to the places.  Because they took her livelihood  away from her.  She didn't mind being a freak  in these side shows.  They started protesting  the places that were  having the freak shows.  She was married  to Alligator Man.  Right.  Alligator guy.  What was his name?  Alligator Man?  I think one Alligator Man  was married to a hairy woman.  Oh, hairy woman.  Wolf woman.  Oh, no, no.  She was married.  She was.  Half woman was married  to one of those tall guys.  Like, tall man.  Right.  Tall man.  And they had the wedding  and stuff.  They had wedding pictures  of tall guy and half girl.  Right.  But who was the one  we talked about? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, Crab, the crab guys.  Crab guys.  They were connected.  Same thing.  They were pissed off.  They worked at freak shows  forever and there's  no more freak shows.  Get where these guys  were connected from.  One guy,  I guess they split.  They were a single body  right to, I guess,  the waist and up to the chest.  So they kind of hung off  of each other in the upper part.  Then it was a single body  during the midsection part  of the body.  But then they had four legs.  Yeah.  So they showed them.  This was great. 
[01:41:00]  They showed them  playing baseball.  They were playing  friggin' baseball.  One is hitting.  One's catching.  And their normal brother  was pitching.  So the one kid would,  the one kid,  the one twin would hit  but the other guy  was catching  and he,  he,  he wouldn't let him run.  He wouldn't let him run.  So he never got the first base  and he would take him out.  And the guy's like there  just to throw the ball to him.  He makes the tag. 
[01:41:30]  How do you throw home  when the guy's round and third?  You just gotta throw it  to the guy that's connected  to the runner.  But the best part was  the way the legs were going.  Four legs  running wildly  with a single body  and two heads.  It was the freakiest  looking thing.  It looked like a crab boy.  Wait,  now,  oh,  okay.  Yeah,  they had like the two heads  and four arms.  Oh,  you scared me  because then we got to  move on to the next one  that I just was reminded of.  Which one?  The,  you know, 
[01:42:00]  and we'll get crucified  for this one.  And you're a special  couple of brothers.  We'll get crucified  for this one  because they're cute.  Yeah,  the two-headed girl.  Two-headed girl.  Oh,  man.  Two-headed girl.  This single body,  single legs,  just two legs,  single body  just splits  like at the neckline  where they had only...  It's two heads  on a body  that almost looks normal.  The shoulders  are a little big  because there's two people 
[01:42:30]  squeezed together there.  But two arms,  two legs,  two heads.  Two heads.  Two heads.  And they're running around  playing soccer and stuff.  Oh,  yeah.  Freaky looking.  And then,  I'm sorry,  you start thinking  about dating implications.  When you have a single...  Help me out.  It was like,  it was either  2020,  2020 downtown.  One of them  and they're having  a serious interview  with these two  about dating and stuff.  Did a whole thing on them.  But when you're thinking,  that's a single vag they got. 
[01:43:00]  Single vag,  yeah.  One.  Then they got two heads  with two separate brains in them.  The whole thing here  is way out there.  What do you do?  Do you get jealous?  If you're the one head  that's dating a guy,  right?  And you want the action.  And you're connected mentally  in a relationship  with the guy.  Right.  And you want to have  some action.  Right.  Now,  But your bitch,  Siamese twin,  is a prude  and she wants to be  a virgin her whole life.  Now what happens?  And then,  you're having great sex 
[01:43:30]  and the other girl  is going to take you up  on rape charges.  Or how about the fact  that maybe the other head  likes the guy too?  Now the two heads  are jealous of one another  because,  hey,  that's my guy.  But they share  the common vag.  Maybe you got to  flip a coin  and figure out,  all right,  you get the balloon knot,  I get the vag.  And that's how  they determine  who the guy  is having sex with who.  And then what if  you've got two guys,  okay?  Two guys,  you're each dating a head.  Right?  You're going to feel  a little funky 
[01:44:00]  that the one guy  is banging your chick.  Are you with me on this?  I lost you somewhere, Ann.  Hello?  I lost you somewhere.  You've got two guys.  Two guys.  One guy's dating one head.  Sure.  Another guy's dating  another head.  Okay.  Now you're going  out on a date.  One guy's going  out on a date,  right?  He bangs the chick.  Now the other guy  comes over to pick  up his date.  He's getting sloppy  seconds.  I think the guy  gets pissed off  at the other guy  because he's  banging his girlfriend.  Exactly.  Okay.  I'm worth it. 
[01:44:30]  What dictates,  that's why I think  the one head  picks the balloon knot,  the other head  picks the front door,  that's exclusive  to them.  And then as far as  What if one of the girls  loves men  and the other  likes bull dykes?  Oh my God.  Imagine that.  Or how about  the one head  is given a Hummer  and the other one's  just got to stare  at his balloon knot  the whole time.  See,  those are the questions  I want answers to. 
[01:45:00]  But instead,  I don't care how  they ride a bike.  Instead,  are you guys hoping  to go to the prom?  You're a special  two-headed thing.  Those are the questions  I would spend hours  getting the answers to.  It truly is an amazing story.  Yeah.  They jump in the pool.  Oh my God.  And they had to learn  because the one head  knows how to swim  and the other didn't stop it.  The one head  works the right side  of the body  and the other head  works the left side  and they can still  run and stuff. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah,  they had to coordinate that.  They were on a bike.  Yeah.  Oh, freaky.  Too freaky.  But it's all those  weird sex questions  that I need answers to.  Now,  the head.  Which head are you going  out with?  Oh, man.  And then, like, what?  You grab an ass with her?  I can understand  the two guys  dating the two heads  at the same time.  You just put your arm  around your respective head,  right?  And you're walking down.  You know,  you're at the mall,  the two guys,  the two heads. 
[01:46:00]  But then,  you know,  you want to do  a little ass grabbing.  You know,  the guy's going to  get pissed off  if you're grabbing  his chick's ass.  Is it just exclusively  you get the right cheek  and he gets the left cheek?  How about this one?  Okay,  you got to see?  What?  I've got to be  very careful here.  Okay.  Which girl wipes?  Oh.  Yeah.  I would think,  are they right-handed  and left-handed?  No,  they'd be both  because the one 
[01:46:30]  is right-handed  and the one's left-handed.  Why didn't they just  alternate?  Do they get in arguments  though?  Like,  it's your turn?  I ain't touching.  I ain't going to  clean up that mess.  Why did you eat this?  Now we have the squirts.  Right?  Mike,  what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I lived in  Redding,  Pennsylvania,  which is where  the girls that were  connected at the head  are from.  All right,  so now we're going  back a few twins ago  now.  Yeah.  Where they're  attached at the head  and the one wants  to be the country  western singer.  Yeah,  well, 
[01:47:00]  I used to be  walking around  the mall  and with my mom,  I was like 10,  12 years old,  something like that,  and we would see  these girls  and my mom would be  like,  Mike,  don't stare,  don't stare,  whatever you do,  don't stare.  You gotta stare!  I know,  I mean,  it was like the  freakiest thing  I've ever seen.  I mean,  it's not every day  that you're walking  through the mall  and you see this girl  with this,  it looked like  she was pushing  around like a walker  and she had this  other girl sitting  on top of it.  It was the freakiest  thing I've ever seen.  She's on a gurney.  Yeah,  I mean,  it was disturbing.  I love the people  like,  don't stare.  We're human beings,  we have to stare. 
[01:47:30]  Let's just make sure  you don't stare  at these people  because they're  special people  and you shouldn't  be staring.  Oh,  we're in commercial?  Roll this freak show  away from me,  I'm gonna puke.  Hey,  Larry,  who are you having  on your show tonight?  Yeah,  I know.  Larry King.  Yeah,  okay,  whatever.  Don't you hate,  don't you hate it  when I sound like  Maury?  All right,  Mike,  thank you.  All right,  thank you,  guys,  so.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  Rick's waiting  downstairs,  we're gonna give  away the Yankee tickets.  I apologize to Rick,  hold on,  Rick,  we're on a pretty  weird roll here.  Ryan,  what's up?  Yo.  Hey.  Did you guys see  the Maury one  with the bodybuilding  midget?  Who was there  to cheer up  the progeria kids?  Was it the midget  or it was a kid?  No,  the guy,  the guy who was  a midget  was a bodybuilder  and he met  the progeria,  they were twin boys.  He met them  at some kind  of a free convention  and he was there  to cheer them up. 
[01:48:30]  That's great.  They met like,  I don't know,  they were friends.  Yeah,  what is he gonna do  to cheer up the kids?  Yeah,  that's cheering me up.  I'm nine years old  and I got the body  of a 96 year old  and I'm gonna die  in about 10 minutes.  But I'm cheered up.  Thank you.  Well,  what I want to know  is how does that  benefit society,  having a bodybuilding midget  cheer a progeria kids  on a TV show?  Ah,  that's just lumping  all the freaks together.  Because then you,  then after you have  like the midgets on  and the progeria kids  and stuff,  then you work  the combinations.  It's like,  you get the half woman 
[01:49:00]  with the progeria kid  and then,  you know,  throwing a,  you know,  some Siamese twins.  You got ratings,  my friend.  You can mix  and match some people.  Right.  Mix and match  your freak shows.  Look at this,  we got a progeria kid  and a goddamn  weightlifting midget.  Be dialing.  Be watching  Maury Povich,  people.  You're gonna see  freak shows.  Look at this,  we got Siamese  twin bitches  connected at the skulls.  And they're  country western singer. 
[01:49:30]  Where are you gonna  find stuff like this?  Look at the  bajuria kid  aging as we speak.  Be watching.  Be watching.  Be watching.  Freak show,  people.  Open up your own  side show.  Open up your own  side show.  Look at the  no body chick  walking on her hands.  That's gotta be  something.  And she got married 
[01:50:00]  to the big tall guy  and she's got no  lower organs.  Yeah,  and on that  HBO freak show,  I think she said  she's pissed off  at the politically  correct people out there.  Took away her  livelihood.  She better just  stay under the  covers at all times.  in bed with the  guy.  Just latch on  like one of those  sucker fishes  because first of all,  I don't want to see you.  You know,  there's a town in  second of all,  hey,  it's all you can do,  really.  You know,  there's a town in  Florida that's where  all the freaks live  from the old  side shows. 
[01:50:30]  Freakville or  whatever the hell it is.  Who the hell's  gone there?  Lobster boy.  Yeah,  he's got the claw  officer boy.  The official officer  boy got shot  by his own family.  Got the claws  and then there's  the wolf woman  who,  I think wolf woman  died recently.  She did.  She did.  She started shaving  by the way.  Yes,  she did.  Because she's a  normal lady.  Of course.  Yes.  All right,  let's go to a  special woman with  hair.  There's so many  good phone calls,  but we promise to  give away these  Yankee tickets.  Rick,  what's going on?  Hey guys, 
[01:51:00]  we are downstairs  and we have about  a hundred or so  people here lined up  to win these  Yankee tickets.  Okay.  All right.  There we go.  Oh,  that was lovely.  Hey Rick.  Yo.  We're going to  have to take a  break and then  we're going to  give away the  tickets next,  I promise,  okay?  Are you kidding  me?  No,  I'm not kidding.  We just talked  about freaks for  20 minutes.  Oh my God,  we got Jennifer  here with the  real,  real nice boobs  ready to just  show everybody.  All right,  we're going to  take a break,  guys. 
[01:51:30]  So,  in about  six or seven  minutes,  we will tell  you what you  have to do  to win the  two pairs of  Yankee tickets.  That's right,  Rick.  It's only six or  seven minutes,  all right?  Six or seven  minutes,  all right.  All right,  hold them at  bay.  We'll be back  with you in  just a bit.  Oh,  you guys suck.  All right,  there he goes,  Rick.  That gives  people a chance  to make it down  outside the  last minute.  Last minute  people,  57th between  Broadway and  7th.  there's a  crowd down  there.  Rick's got  two pairs 
[01:52:00]  of tickets  courtesy of  Budweiser for  the game  tonight at  Yankee Stadium.  Someone's going  to win them,  get on the  subway and  rip up their  Yankee Stadium.  And right  after we  take a quick  break,  Rick will  tell these  people what  they have  to do to  win the  Yankee tickets.  Okay?  I hope  they're taking  pictures.

[01:53:30]  1027 WNEW.  We're back with  the Opie and  Anthony show.  Cat Man,  real fast.  Yeah, you  guys are  unbelievable.  I almost drove  off the  freaking road  listening to  the bit about  the freak.  We could have  gone on for  another half  hour, but we  got to give  away the Yankee  tickets.  I was laughing  so hard I was  in tears.  You guys went  right to the  edge and  jumped off both  feet, no neck.  All right.  We'll get back 
[01:54:00]  to that right  after we give  away the Yankee  tickets.  Thanks, Cat  Man.  Yeah, you  suck.  Take it easy,  guys.  I got to say  thank you quick  to some tool.  Didn't give  his name.  Gave me the  link to Dan's  Gallery of  the Grotesque.  Oh, I've  been there  before.  Neonatal  Nightmares.  He's got  just freak  baby pictures  that are the  most disturbing  things I've  ever seen in  my life.  And they got  cute names to  them.  Are they  pickled punks?  No, these  are like actual  pickled punks 
[01:54:30]  are the fetuses  that have been  in freak shows,  freak fetuses  in fluid.  Most of  those are  old time  abortion.  Dude, you  want to see  something real  sick?  Yeah, I'll  show you.  This one's  called, hold  on.  What?  I'll take the  challenge with  you.  Okay.  Because this is  reminding me of  something I have  in my book bag,  if someone could  go get it.  Oh, you're not  going to make me  look at something  bad, are you?  Oh, yeah.  If you show me  something gross,  you have to look  at what I'm going  to show you.  I forgot to show  you this.  Matter of fact,  at least give  me a subject. 
[01:55:00]  Nope.  Nope, because I  know what grosses  you out.  What I show you  will be more  gross than what  you're about to  show me, and I  will make you a  bet, my friend.  Well, okay,  gross is one  thing.  I think this is  gross disturbing.  Is it gross  disturbing?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Here's a picture  that they entitled  Peekaboo.  Peekaboo, baby  picture.  Peekaboo.  Oh.  It seems there 
[01:55:30]  is some malfunction  in that baby, and  it's a cyclops.  Let me tell you  something.  That's not that  bad because it's  in black and  white.  Oh, no.  Old time  photographs, for  some reason, if  it's in black and  white or you  know it went on  in the 50s, kind  of separates.  Kind of separates  a little bit.  Here's Jabba,  baby.  Yeah, it's one  big, huge, giant  tumor eyeball. 
[01:56:00]  Make sure, oh, my  God.  Wow, that one  almost got me.  Yeah, that.  Here's just some  of the names.  Centipede, froggy,  goldfish.  Goldfish is pretty  sick.  Look at goldfish.  Okay.  It's a sight with  deformed goddamn  children on it.  It's Dan's Gallery  of the Grotesque?  Yeah.  I haven't checked  out that site in  years.  We'll link it to  foundrymusic.com. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, thank Christ.  Well, you know,  people got to know,  I mean, we have a  lot of new listeners  out there.  So all this stuff  we talk about on  the show, eventually  we put it up on  our unofficial  website.  You can get to  it through  opianthony.com.  foundrymusic.com.  I'm telling you,  it's a great one.  Okay, let me take  out my latest  edition of Bizarre  Magazine, Anthony.  Where did you get  Bizarre Magazine?  And what?  You can only get  this in selected  newsstands.  It's a European  maxim, kind of. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  Oh, no.  Pick him up soon.  People could get  kicked out by police.  Whoa, okay.  All right.  Thank God.  No, you did not  get saved.  You did not get  saved.  I did.  I will go back  to that.  Rick is outside  the building.  What's up, Rick?  Everybody left.  What?  Yes, you are.  Everybody left.  No, I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ.  I just had a heart  attack.  Okay.  I'm crying.  I'm sorry.  These listeners are  getting ugly out here.  All right.  We're on a good  roll.  Here's the deal,  just in case people  are tuning in for the 
[01:57:30]  first time today.  Yankee excitement is  huge in New York  right now.  We have two pairs of  tickets to give away  to tonight's game at  the stadium, courtesy of  Budweiser, the king of  beers.  We told people to,  to, to, to,  wow.  Hold on, Rick,  to show up outside  the station, right?  We have a nice crowd  outside, and we told  them we would tell  them what they had to  do for Yankee tickets,  right?  Yep.  That's where we are  as we talk to Rick  outside the building.  Rick, we have a good  crowd, huh?  Yeah, I think we have  a good crowd so far. 
[01:58:00]  Well over 100 people  are still in there.  They're a little restless.  They want, they want  to know what they have  to do.  Rick, you got to  start by asking,  show up outside the  station, right?  Yeah, a nice crowd  outside.  Hello?  Whose radio is up  loud?  Yeah, tell them  to turn down the  radio.  What'd you say?  Ask them how bad  they want to go to  the Yankee game.  How bad do you  freaking people want  to go to the Yankee  game?  Oh my God.  Are you willing to  do just about  anything? 
[01:58:30]  Are you willing to  do just about  anything to go to  the Yankee game?  Well, not, not as  big an applause  to him.  How many of you  think Rick is a  fag?  How many of you  think Opie's a  man?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, pussy.  Pussy.  All right, Ant, I  guess it's time,  isn't it?  Yeah, yeah, it's  time.  Okay.  Yeah, we are  again.  All right, Rick.  Yeah.  If you will, why 
[01:59:00]  don't you tell the  crowd what they have  to do for the two  pairs of tickets to  see the game tonight  at Yankee Stadium?  All right, up for  grabs is two pairs  of tickets for  tonight's game five  at Yankee Stadium.  Opie and Anthony  are looking for  the first two  people in this  group, first two  people with a pair,  first two people to  get completely naked  starting now.  Here we go.  You're not naked,  dude.  You still got your  shoes on and  everything.  First two people. 
[01:59:30]  We got one.  No, you got socks  on.  You got socks  on.  We got two winners.  You guys, we got  one cut and one  uncut winner.  Oh, my God.  It's probably the  scariest display of  Yankee tradition and  pride I've ever seen.  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing? 
[02:00:00]  We're just hanging  out with a bunch of  naked guys.  Great.  Thanks, guys.  With the exception  of Jennifer from  Jersey getting  totally naked and  not getting naked  fast enough, that  was pretty gay.  Pretty gay.  We'll bring  Jennifer up to  meet the guys.  So, Rick, what  happened when you  talked?  They're a loud  crowd.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  What happened when  you made the 
[02:00:30]  announcement?  What was the  reaction of the  crowd?  Most people,  their jaws dropped.  Yeah.  The others who  were close to the  front started  roofing off their  clothes.  Some guy started  dancing around  thinking he won,  but he still had  his socks and  his shoes on,  so that didn't  count, and he  ended up not  winning.  Oh, so he was  naked except for  shoes and socks,  and he didn't win.  He got his feet,  his socks, and his  shoes all tied up in  his pants, and he  almost fell down.  Did we get  pictures for the  website?  We got lots of 
[02:01:00]  pictures for the  website.  Cool, we'll have  pictures up later on  openanthony.com.  Hey, Rick, bring up  our winners, but make  sure they're clothed,  all right?  All right, we're all  winners.  Two other guys.  We're going to bring  you up as well.  All right, cool.  Everybody else, thanks  for showing up.  How you doing?  How you doing?  All right, Rick.  Rick, good job, bro.  All right.  There you go.  There you go. 
[02:01:30]  Everyone commenting  now on instant feedback,  it really, that Rick  really noticed quickly  their schlong types.  It's like, wow, Rick  noticed really quick.  Leave it to Rick to  notice their junk.  Rick, yeah, and the  phones are exploding  with the same stuff,  so thank you, NYPD.  Thank you, NYPD.  Yes.  They could easily  shut us down today.  Yes.  Thank you, NYPD.  All right. 
[02:02:00]  Do we have to do  something or anything?  Usually we take a little  commercial break, but  don't we have to do  that?  Maybe we should do  that.  Well, if you were over  here and you were going  to push the button,  sure, sure, sure.  You know, I think I'm  going to get the crappy  end of this deal.  I don't like the  disturbing, disgusting  stuff.  How many pictures did  he show me, Ben?  Three or four?  I showed you two.  You're a liar.  You showed me  Goldfish Boy, the  Cyclops, and you  know you showed me at 
[02:02:30]  least three.  Oh, and Popeye.  Popeye.  Okay.  So I have to decide on  three pictures from the  Bizarre Gallery.  No, oh, God.  Wait, wait, wait.  I just saw like a piece  of a picture, and it  looks like something  juicy.  I can't believe this is  in a magazine that a lot  of people buy in England.  Okay.  What's the title of the  article?  It's just called  Bizarre Gallery.  Fifty Gallery Greats.  And it's based on what?  Accidents or normal  occurrences in life? 
[02:03:00]  The gallery is where  Bizarre says, look at  what's out there.  We run images of  almost anything that  shows the world and the  events within it in a  dramatic, exciting,  funny, and horrifying  life.  Oh, so it could be  anything.  Every photograph is  real, and every image  we have ever run has  always had some  justification.  We dig up the details  in the background to  the events portrayed  and put the picture in  context, explaining what  is going on, how it  might relate to the  bigger picture, and why  the photograph is  extraordinary.  Oh, no.  Humor often makes up a  big part of what we say  about the images, but  it's never gratuitous. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah, right.  Never just pointing and  laughing.  Yeah, right.  The picture always makes  a point, and that's why  the gallery is unique in  British magazines.  Ah.  Hold on, hold on, hold  them up.  I don't want to look.  Let's see.  I don't like it because I  get nightmares, first of  all.  I get the nightmares, and  then I get these images  stuck in my head when I  try to eat.  Okay, I will start you  off with an easy one,  Anthony.  All right, wait a minute.  Let me just cover my  eyes a little bit.  And I'll look through  the binocchio.  I'll tell you what it is 
[02:04:00]  in a second.  You want to explain it  for the listeners?  It looks to be an arm,  someone's arm.  Yeah, laid out.  And it's a healthy arm  because it's got some  color to it.  Yeah.  Laid out, and the  picture stops at the  forearm around there  somewhere.  And then I see some  fingers wrapped around  the arm like someone's  trying to take a pulse a  little too high up on  the arm.  Okay.  This is finger-sticking  goods.  Severed by machinery,  this woman's fingers were  sewed to her forearm. 
[02:04:30]  To keep them alive.  Oh, my God.  I start you off easy, bro.  Why?  Why would they do that?  Huh?  To keep them alive until  they could reattach them?  Yeah, I guess.  That one is...  That one, Ben?  Couldn't they clip the  nails?  That's not bad.  Okay.  Ben doesn't even like  these.  This is disgusting.  I don't like...  Oh, now he turns you  in one.  This is a free one  because we were  talking about this.  This is a free one. 
[02:05:00]  Look, there's the  twins we were talking  about.  Where one is the  country western singer.  Where?  Right there, right there.  Oh, yeah, look at that.  What's happening up top?  Just target practice.  Oh, okay.  No big deal.  All right.  There's the twins.  They're on a cruise.  They got a picture of  them.  All right.  All right.  Why is that a free one?  Because that was what  we were talking about.  I've already seen two.  Okay, hold on.  Oh, no.  Okay, I'll show you.  That's pretty hot,  but all right,  I'll show you this one.  I'm covering my eyes 
[02:05:30]  again.  Hold on.  That one.  Where's that?  That's a cute kitten.  No, up top.  Oh, God.  What is that?  That's the two-headed  kitten below, by the way.  What is that?  Describe it,  because this is radio, man.  It just looks like  carnage.  It's a mummified body  that has its chest  ripped out.  It looks like alien  came out of it.  Right.  Okay.  It's all...  What is it?  Well, Anthony,  that is the primate plate.  Skinless, headless,  raw monkey is a delicacy  in French Guiana. 
[02:06:00]  It looks like a mummy.  That's a skin monkey  without a head.  Give me that goddamn thing.  No, because I've got to  show you another one.  I'm just going to throw it away.  I know.  I know your tricks.  Damn it.  One more.  One more you get.  One more.  I still think I've already  seen three.  One more.  One.  One more.  I just hope you know.  What is that?  What is that foot?  You can show me that.  I'll give you that.  It's a baby foot.  Whoa.  Two, four, six,  eight toes.  Eight toed baby foot.  All right.  Hold on. 
[02:06:30]  That was just funny.  Freaks.  No.  You can scan some  of these in, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, we should put them  on the website.  Okay.  Oh, God.  Everyone's freaking out.  Oh, God.  Jesus Christ.  What is that?  It looks like reddish  tinged cauliflower  growing out of where  somebody's top half  of their foot should be.  Yeah, no toes, though.  The toes look like  they were severed,  and then there's this  cauliflower mess  growing out from 
[02:07:00]  where the toes used to be.  Is that leprosy?  Yeah, very good.  Leprosy.  Great.  Very good, bro.  Diagnosis.  What is that?  Dude, what is that?  That's a pickled punk, right?  Tell me that doesn't  look like Yoda.  It's Yoda.  It looks exactly like Yoda  from Star Wars.  Hey, what's in the lower, right?  Look at the little baby junk,  and it says,  this baby was still born  without a brain  in the 50s.  It's on show  in the anatomy department  of Belgian Uni.  That looks like  something out of the X-Files. 
[02:07:30]  What's that on the bottom?  This one?  Yeah.  What happened there?  A couple committed suicide  on the roof of their building,  and people are just going  about their business  down below,  and no one has a clue.  Is that real, though?  Yeah, they're just  laying in the snow,  and they both have  bullet wounds to the head.  Where'd you find this?  That was in Russia.  That's cute.  Check out the pinheads.  And check out this.  No, what is...  Check out that.  What is that, brain surgery?  What is going on there?  Well, it's...  Well, you've got to describe it 
[02:08:00]  for the audience.  It looks to be  the top of a skull,  and it's kind of cut open.  It's got a hole in it,  and I see glove surgeons' hands  manipulating something  out of there.  What is it?  Anthony,  it's a 21-week-old fetus  being operated on  while still inside  his mother's womb.  See the little hand  sticking out?  The tiny little hand?  Jesus Christ.  And I can't even...  I don't want to look.  What is that in the bottom?  That's just a torso, Anthony.  Just a torso.  A victim of Miami drug wars 
[02:08:30]  washed up on the beach  in 1981.  That's about it.  All right.  Thank you.  I'm done.  Now I got that queasy feeling  that only an ice-hole  Sam Adams can cure.  There was one more  I wanted to show you, though.  This will freak you out.  What?  I forgot about this one.  Too late.  I'm already...  Check this out.  It's a head.  It's a head in the middle  of a street.  Give me that.  I got to look now. 
[02:09:00]  Nice.  A victim of the  eight-year civil war  in Liberia.  Locals are too used  to violent death  or too concerned  for their own safety  to be bothered by it.  It is a guy's head  just in the middle  of the road.  Yeah.  With like a little  smear mark  where it was maybe  kicked over to the side  or something.  Yeah.  There you go.  It looked like  Henry Coleman's head.  But that's fresh head.  I mean,  that's like someone  that just got  decapitated very recently.  Are you then  going to show me  used head?  The five-legged bull? 
[02:09:30]  Yeah,  I've seen that.  I don't mind  livestock anomalies.  How about this one?  Chopping off the head  of the Marr Festival.  Look at that.  Whip.  Oof.  That's great.  Thank you.  Thank you for the blood,  guts,  and disgusting stuff.  I've had enough.  Okay.  Hey,  let's bring in our Yankee winners.  They've got to get  to the stadium.  Ugh.  It was a fair contest,  by the way.  I hope people aren't pissed.  Steve,  you got some good footage  out there?  Oh, yeah.  The sausage hangout  side was well documented. 
[02:10:00]  How many guys  were naked out there?  I saw about five,  I think.  At least five?  Yeah.  But these two guys  were the first ones,  right?  Yeah,  these two.  And Steve,  you're going to have  stuff up on  foundrymusic.com?  This evening.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y  music.com.  I've got to explain  to people,  because people  have been emailing us,  they're really confused.  Yeah.  There's opiananthony.com,  which is pretty much  just something  that has a lot of links  and some pictures.  Yeah.  You know,  we have the  boob-a-lantern contest  on there.  But all the juicy stuff  is on foundrymusic.com 
[02:10:30]  for the most part.  opiananthony.com.  Yeah.  I hope that all  makes sense,  okay?  That's why we sometimes  say foundrymusic.com,  opiananthony.com.  They're all linked  in some way,  though.  Yeah.  Okay.  Guys,  you're standing out there.  All of a sudden,  Rick says,  first person  that gets completely naked  wins the Yankee tickets.  Did you hesitate  for a second?  Not a second.  I didn't hesitate  for one second,  but then Rick mentioned  that I have foreskin,  and that really bothered me. 
[02:11:00]  That was kind of tough.  Kind of tough to swallow,  huh?  Yeah, a little hard.  He's like,  one cut and one uncut.  I was like,  oh, God.  Great, great.  Rick noticed.  A lot of people  noticing that Rick noticed.  Jesus Christ.  I don't know.  How many people?  I must say that I had  a very good amount  of shrinkage, though.  Did you?  What do we have?  A little over 100 people  out there,  and how many people  went for it?  What percentage  of the crowd?  I would say about 15%  actually went for it.  15% kind of went for it,  and the rest  just kind of walked away  a little bit.  Stepped back  once the clothes 
[02:11:30]  started flying.  Yeah, and then one guy  I hear took everything off  except his shoes.  Yeah, that was the  heavy dude in the Mercedes  who parked it in front.  He's jumping around  and dancing,  saying, look,  I'm naked, I'm naked,  but he still had  his pants around his ankles,  his socks,  and his shoes on.  I'm like,  no, you've got to get them off.  Yeah, we said completely naked.  And then he almost fell down,  and he could never get them off.  That's great.  That's funny.  And what's your names,  and where are you from?  Mike, New York.  Yeah, any shout-outs, Mike?  I'd just like to give a shout-out  to my friend Roger out there,  and that's it. 
[02:12:00]  All right, there you go.  And you?  I'm Joey from Whitestone.  I just, I don't know,  my dad's probably listening,  so what's up, Dad?  I'm going to the Yankee game.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Dad, I got completely naked.  Yeah, actually, like...  Have you been to a Yankee  World Series game?  Not a World Series game.  No?  No.  Yeah, I went to,  like you guys said it,  and I started taking off my clothes,  and then they're like,  okay, you won, you won.  And I was like,  what am I doing?  And I started,  look, my sweatpants are on backwards.  Oh, you went to get dressed really quick.  Oh, my God.  I still got one sock in my hand,  and underwear, and a shirt.  But you're going to the game, 
[02:12:30]  courtesy of Budweiser.  The king of beers.  All right.  Well, congratulations, guys.  And who's this lovely lady, Rick?  And this is Jennifer from Jersey.  Hi, Jennifer.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Did you try to get naked?  I tried really hard,  but, you know,  I was a guy.  Girls got a lot more stuff.  It's kind of hard  to just rip your clothes off.  You know, you said it was fair to everyone,  and it was unfair, I think.  Looking through that shirt.  I thought you'd have to be a little biased towards me.  Why is that?  Well, kind of everything your show stands for, kind of.  Yeah.  I thought I had a better chance. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, she's pretty sexy, Anthony.  Look at her.  I know.  Look at the shirt she's wearing there.  Rick, did you get to see everything right through this?  Yes, we did.  You did?  And I thought you guys should see them, too.  Well, do we have any...  I really love Yankee tickets.  I don't know if...  Uh-uh.  Could you maybe, you know,  look around and look around.  Do we have anything later on here?  Preferably Yankee tickets.  It's not like, you know something?  It is certainly not like there are plenty of these tickets to go around.  If we gave away two pairs, it's because we only had...  That guy has one sock in his hand.  Was one still on his foot?  No.  Maybe we should... 
[02:13:30]  There's no recounting.  And then the other one.  On this one.  Yeah, we don't have any more World Series Yankee tickets.  We have...  Wow T-shirts!  Great, guys.  Thanks.  Well, we suck.  I don't know.  Are those natural?  Yeah, they're real.  Naturally occurring?  Yeah?  Can we take a little look?  Because we entertain you so well every day, I'm sure.  Ah, there you go.  Help me in.  Help me in.  I really, really like something more than the t-shirt.  Preferably Yankee tickets as I previously...  You know something?  This just goes to show you how hot her cans look underneath the shirt. 
[02:14:00]  Because any other girl, if it was even an inkling that your cans weren't hot, we'd be like,  You effing prize pig whore, get out of here.  Dude, no bra.  Those are...  Wow, really?  No bra.  And they are sitting...  Look at you with the lift.  ...really nice.  Did you get a lift or something?  No.  You just were blessed with...  Boobs said lift.  How about that?  It might be a little bit of a shirt.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Well, Rick has seen them. 
[02:14:30]  How about just a quick flash and then we'll march you down to the prize closet and you can  pick out whatever you like.  Is that Rick on, please?  There you go.  I had to dump out because we can't say the t-words.  Yeah, but you'll get more than a bumper sticker.  I guarantee you.  That's okay.  A little...  Wow.  What was it?  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Guys, what do you think?  Those could be the nicest boobs I've seen this week.  Why weren't you in our best boob contest?  Because those would win.  Those are D's. 
[02:15:00]  No, C's.  Those are full C's.  34 C.  They're rather full, yeah.  34 C.  Full C.  Sure.  Yeah.  Can you do that again?  Wow.  No.  You got...  Oh, look.  Can you do that again?  No.  One more time.  One more time.  One more time.  Concert tickets.  Someone is doing concert tickets.  We got concert tickets?  Concert tickets.  Concert tickets.  We don't have Yankee tickets.  We got concert tickets.  Guys, you want to see it again?  Yes.  Who wouldn't?  No.  Uh-oh.  Playing hard again. 
[02:15:30]  Now that we've seen it once, though, now some words might start flying.  You get that on video?  Yeah.  All right.  We'll just push rewind during the commercials.  What's your name?  You want to give any shout-outs or anything?  Sure.  I'd just like to say hi to Terry O'Malley.  Hi, Terry.  That's it.  All right.  Dating an Irish boy.  Okay.  We're not really dating.  Just effing.  Nothing wrong with that. 
[02:16:00]  Nothing wrong with that.  There you go.  What's wrong with a good banging?  All right.  Well, thank you.  Well, thanks to everyone.  You guys enjoy the game tonight, man.  Yeah.  Have fun.  Go Yankees.  Go Diamondbacks.  Oh, shut up.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Those are absolutely beautiful.  We can give her a DVD player.  How about a Samsung DVD player?  All right.  What do you think?  You got a second showing for that?  You don't want a DVD player?  I'm not sure.  And a Yankee jacket?  And a what?  Or a Yankee jacket. 
[02:16:30]  A Yankee jacket?  I'd really rather have a Yankee jacket.  For the...  What are these nice guys?  It's an authentic Yankee bullpen jacket.  Wait.  What could I do for the jacket?  For taking the game?  Absolutely nothing.  She might be willing to trade.  What?  What?  I could have my DVD player for your Yankee.  Yeah.  No.  That's happening.  I got this great bumper sticker.  No.  We haven't even offered you a goddamn bumper sticker for this.  It's DVD players, Yankee bullpen jackets. 
[02:17:00]  We'll even throw in a Boogeyman DVD.  It's not even like you're the one that's saying we're offering you a bumper sticker.  We got you a Samsung DVD player.  They're only boobs.  Yeah.  They're nice, but...  And they have to stay out for 15 seconds.  What do you think?  What?  15 seconds.  Of what?  I think for all that...  For the jacket and the DVD player, just a flash?  No.  The shirt's got to come off.  She's got to stand there for 15 seconds. 
[02:17:30]  With the shirt completely off.  You can keep them.  I'd really like Yankee stickers.  Well, we don't have them.  I'll do it.  Yeah, of course you will.  You've already gotten completely naked.  Going once.  Opie, I don't think...  No.  I'm going to withdraw the offer of the prize.  It's not that big a deal to be...  We've been flashed by beautiful...  Don't get me wrong.  Very beautiful breasts.  Thank you.  But I think the prize that we're given, the jacket and everything, and the DVD player,  is a little too much for what we're actually asking for. 
[02:18:00]  I think we're getting a little carried away here with this.  Oh, look at you.  Yeah.  He wouldn't say that if Steve didn't get that on video.  You know that, right?  Of course.  I'm playing bad con.  Well, we're going to give your DVD player away tomorrow, or maybe later on in the show.  Just give me the DVD player.  No.  No.  No.  The offer was withdrawn and taken off the table.  Now you get a bumper sticker.  If you want to get back into our good graces, you're going to have to add something to the flash. 
[02:18:30]  You'll just get a bumper sticker.  Right?  She can get back in our good graces, but now it's more than a flash.  I know how to play hardball.  I dealt with Ken Stevens during contract negotiations, and I made him take his shirt off and stand there for 15 seconds.  I'll take my shirt off for 15 seconds.  You will?  No.  But now it has to be more than that, we say.  Right.  That offer has been withdrawn.  I'm very sorry, but that offer was withdrawn.  Ricky.  What?  What'd she say? 
[02:19:00]  She says she's not going to, uh-uh, for a DVD player.  No, we haven't asked that.  But that, no.  Completely withdrawn.  I will.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I want to thank everyone for coming in.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Thank you.  We have to take a break, Anthony?  Yes.  And thank you very much for the showing of the, uh, the, uh, cans.  That was nice.  Thank you.  They're very lovely.  Thank you.  And we'll be back. 
[02:19:30]  Opie and Anthony.  I have to make.  1-0-2-7.  WNW.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Boob girl's going home empty-handed.  Well, she wanted another chance, but I think then she sobered up and now she's running out  the door.  That was it.  I'm glad we didn't give away the DVD player, Anthony.  I am so glad right now that we finally drew a line in the sand. 
[02:20:00]  Look at us having morals.  We always, we usually get taken advantage of on this program when it comes to things like  that because we get caught up in the moment and, uh, there was no way that even her boobs,  which were very nice, warranted us giving away DVD player and a great Yankee jacket.  That I myself could take home.  They were, who are you, Pop-Tart Roger?  Where's my satellite system? 
[02:20:30]  Yeah, there's no, there was no reason for that.  All right.  Because then I heard she wanted to come in and get completely naked for the jacket and  the DVD player.  So what happened with that?  No.  I, I almost had it.  I, you know, as she got more sober, she, you know, she, she, you know, regained some of  her common sense and, uh, that was really what affected it, I think.  But she was, during spots, she was willing to get in here and get naked for all the stuff.  Did you, did you get real close?  Hold her hand and go, you're a special girl.  We need you. 
[02:21:00]  Need you on this show.  It'll help out.  Tried to lure her into a trunk outside.  That almost worked.  All right.  Well, enough with that.  Okay.  Okay.  Booble lantern contest will be decided tomorrow, Anthony.  Tomorrow, has, has the voting been, uh, going well?  Uh, going very well.  Yeah.  Is there a runaway leader?  I haven't looked at any of the voting yet.  It's a, it's a, it's between three girls at this point.  Between three of the girls.  All right.  We won't say which.  Don't worry.  And we got three prizes. 
[02:21:30]  Aerosmith tickets, uh, Aerosmith tickets for either Philly, Boston, or New York.  A Samsung DVD player.  Ah.  Oh.  Ah.  Oh.  And a thousand dollars for first place.  Cash.  Nice.  We'll announce the winners tomorrow at the end of the show.  Okay?  So make sure you vote.  Go to opiananthony.com.  Cool.  A couple of instant feedbacks coming in, uh, coming in, uh, stupid mailman from Yonkers  writes, you know what the Postal Service is doing to protect us mailmen?  We have a red-colored plastic bin in our vans and place suspected mail in the bin. 
[02:22:00]  Hmm.  So we could ride around with potential spores for the next six hours.  Well, at least it won't get all over everything.  Isn't that amazing?  Yeah, I didn't know they were doing that.  That's something.  And what, FedEx and everybody else has been fine?  No one's gotten any FedEx anthrax?  Uh, Anthony, breaking news from Boston.  Yes.  I don't know what you were just saying.  I got really distracted because Steve has something.  Steve, yes?  Steve?  Yeah, I'm in Boston.  Yeah. 
[02:22:30]  I was just, uh, listening to, uh, I just flipped through the channels.  I happened to flip by AAF, your old, uh, station there.  Rocko's pulling the fake, uh, breakup with the girlfriend bit.  Oh, my God.  He's breaking that, he's breaking that one out again, huh?  Oh, yeah.  That cute little bit.  Eh, it's a ride.  Eh, you bitch.  Is it him or, uh, his, uh, partner's girlfriend that he's breaking?  No, it's him and he's, she's saying that, uh, he's been all these girls because he's  on radio.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we have all our fights on the air.  Has the acting gotten better at least or is it still, uh, very, very bad acting? 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, it's, it's pretty scripted.  Hey, why is Maury Povich doing this?  So, it's the, it's the fake breakup with the girlfriend bit today.  Hey, that's kind of cute.  Hey, Rocko, I think it's time to bring out the breakup with the girlfriend bit again.  Is she, uh, is she faking crying and all that?  Like, she's really upset?  Yeah, she's faking the, the pissed off.  She found out that he has so many girls because he's on radio.  Yeah, yeah, right.  Okay.  After checking in, guys. 
[02:23:30]  God, is anyone believing this?  Jesus Christ, you know, oh, he's been doing that garbage for years and it's just, it's,  it's like an insult.  It's an embarrassment to what we accomplished in Boston.  Yeah, you know, we, we, we took that slot, brought it where it was and then he, uh, you  know, without any ifs, ands, a buzz jumped right in there without even saying it.  He didn't say anything to us, took our slot, which is fine.  Things are much better now.  Believe me.  It did us a favor if you really think about it. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, thank you.  We don't have to deal with Dave Dickless and it's an easy three to seven slot to kick ass  in, uh, over the likes of, uh, rock hole.  But the, the phony wedding, the phony, I'm breaking up with my chick or, oh, my chick  found out I'm doing this.  So now we're, we're having this argument on the air every day playing tape.  You know, you know where I would supposed to sound spontaneous, like, hey, who's on  the phone now?  Uh-oh, it's my chick. 
[02:24:30]  Watch what I do now, Matty.  Watch this, man.  My chick's on the phone.  Really?  All right, check this out.  And then he hits the tape.  But Dave told me I only got two minutes to break up with her because I got to get it back  to the music.  Let, let, let me, let me let you in on a little something.  What do you think?  It's coincidence that his bitchy girlfriend calls up during the small segment Dave allows  rock hole to talk?  No, rock hole has to play records as per a list that has all the times that the records are  supposed to play on it. 
[02:25:00]  Believe me, he's Dave's little puppet.  So what do you think?  It's a coincidence that his girlfriend calls during the times where he's able to talk?  No.  He calls her up, whoever she is, and says, all right, we're going to do the girlfriend  bit.  All right, I'll hit record.  He records it and then plays it during his break and then tries to make it sound like,  hey, who's calling?  Well, there's a, there's a, there's a reason why he records it too.  You know, you can do a couple of takes.  You can do a couple of takes.  Hey, you didn't sound sad enough. 
[02:25:30]  You could add in stuff.  If you think of something a little later, could you cut some onions at your house?  Maybe that'll make you cry.  Yeah.  I need your nose to run a little bit.  If you could be my breaking up chick, Dave, did you sound convincing?  Oh yes, Rocco.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll be the best man at your wedding.  I liked that bit.  It was good.  It is the fake, oh, just a fake phony, hey, well, you know, tune in tomorrow and see  what happens with my chick. 
[02:26:00]  I got a pretty serious situation here, but.  Hey, screw that bitch.  But I only have two minutes to take care of it because I'm in the middle of another rock  block.  Great.  All right.  Yeah, I'm really pissed off.  Here's Chop Suey for the hundredth time this, this week alone.  Yeah, wish I had more time, but Dave has me on a stopwatch.  That bitch.  Maddie, let's go to a ten show club and get some tail.  Get me over this depression. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Rocco, I don't think you should be with that girl.  Yeah, thanks a lot, honey.  Why don't you come and hang out with me?  Watch this, Maddie.  I'll show her.  I'm going to the city tonight, Worcester.  We're going to hang out.  It's going to be great, Maddie.  Hey, hey, hey, babe.  I don't think it's working out anymore.  I'm going my own way.  Hey, Rocco, I think you're wonderful, and I don't think that your girlfriend should treat  you that way. 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, baby.  Why don't you say you come over here and I, oh, we got to start.  We got to go back into music.  Dave's going to wave his hand at me at the door.  So even though this is really important to my life, I'll continue after another five in  a row.  And I got to make sure I give away some of the tickets I stole from Dave's office, where  we rock all day.  And then we'll get back to the breaking up with the girlfriend bit.  And I record another segment. 
[02:27:30]  And don't forget, Monday starts my fake suspension.  So there's a lot to squeeze in before I go on my fake suspension this year.  Could you just, you know something?  Just call him fake hole.  Maddie, I'm so distraught, I'm going to steal the AF van.  And then the listeners can call and go, hey, they see me, you know, driving down the Mass  Pike and he looks crazy.  He might do something stupid, like repaint the bridge with his name on it again. 
[02:28:00]  Tool.  Hey, shut up.  It's a great bit.  It's worked every other time I've done it.  Oh, man.  And nobody in Boston had pointed out that this was all fake.  I would like to believe, and I really, I kind of do, that there couldn't have been that  many people that were buying this crap.  Well, a lot of people, you know, shame, shame, shame.  Shame on you Boston listeners. 
[02:28:30]  A lot of you guys weren't buying some of this stuff until we, you know, told you what the  real deal was.  Shame, shame, shame.  Yeah, you know, whoever was buying that and really thinking, hey, did you hear that?  Rockhole was breaking up.  Was it?  Please.  Don't tell me you were, you were buying that.  I can't believe you're breaking up with me on the air.  I'm going to, you know what I'm going to do?  I'm going to listen to Rockhole.  Hey, honey, screw you.  You cold hearted bitch.  Yeah, bitch. 
[02:29:00]  You know what I'm going to do?  What?  I'm going to fly a plane over Foxborough with a ticket number on it, and the chick that's  sitting in that seat's going to be my new girlfriend.  The same way I picked Maddie.  Screw you, whore.  I told her Maddie, right?  Hey, the latest from Disturbed.  I'm down with the sickness, are you?  Yeah, but you'll be down with the sickness after I bang some, some strippers and give 
[02:29:30]  it to you, you bitch.  I'm going to sit on a billboard until this twat dies.  You ass.  Who's believing it?  Yeah, with the fake crying chick on the other end.  Now someone's saying that he's trying to get back with her.  That goes along with the bed, and then the wheels are in, and...  No, I made up my mind.  You got to go. 
[02:30:00]  You're not getting back with me, honey.  You're not worthy.  I got my chicks.  Steve, what's up?  Steve.  Steve, man.  Dave.  Yeah, Dave, what's up, bro?  Hey, how's it going?  I hope he's on his second impression with Maury Povich and Rockhole.  Let me tell you something.  You're playing the O&A drinking game.  There should be a lot of drunk people out there, because I did some Brian Regan today.  I did my Maury.  I did...  Oh, there was a couple more in there. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How's it going, guys?  I did my Rockhole.  I did my Dave Dickless.  That's right.  It's a good bit, Rockhole.  Stick with it.  I think that'll get the ratings back.  You know, the ones that Opie and Anthony completely grabbed out from under you?  Well, that'll lead to the next contest.  Yeah.  Little if it...  All right.  Foxborough.  Go out on a date with Rockhole.  Yeah, look.  I'm going to need a new chick.  So all week long, we're taking your calls to be Rockhole's chick. 
[02:31:00]  You call up and tell me why you want to be my chick.  And then we're going to fly a plane over Lansdowne.  What an ass.  Oh, my God.  Does that suck?  Does that royally just suck?  Fake breaking up with girl bits.  Never good.  Always bad.  Always bad.  Where's some good Rockhole? 
[02:31:30]  I think we got some on the...  Oh, I can't get it up now on the computer.  That's all right.  Wanted to hear some Rockhole.  Some great song parodies.  I am Taliban.  Oh, God.  Eric, what's up?  Hey.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey.  Hey, you guys got to listen to this.  He's doing now...  You guys got to throw the first bottle over here in Beantown at AAF. 
[02:32:00]  Rocco's doing this A-hole of the day bet where he says, has anybody treated you bad?  Has a boss given you the shaft?  Are you an A-hole?  Rocco, if you're somebody's boss that you got the shaft for the wrong reason and he didn't go to bat for you, you give us a call.  And the worst person, the worst A-hole of the day is going to win a prize.  You guys got to call him.  Yeah, the biggest A-hole boss. 
[02:32:30]  Well, I'll call Rocco.  I had an A-hole boss once.  His name was Dave Dicklett.  Dave.  He had no spine and didn't stick up for us.  Thank you, Eric.  Yeah, Rocco.  I had a boss once.  He was a big tool.  Well, tell me about it.  Yeah, he had this gay porno 70s mustache.  Yeah.  And he'd invite us into the conference room to write words like passion up on a blackboard and try to tell us what to do.  Wait a minute. 
[02:33:00]  That's my boss.  Yeah, he's a tool, isn't he?  You're a dick.  Dave, I'm sorry that aired.  I hit play on the recorder because I don't do any bits live because I don't know how to.  Hey, I broke into the boss's office and I'll be giving away tickets all week to try to get my new chick that I'm going to marry.  The wedding. 
[02:33:30]  We got a videotape of that.  Did we ever talk about that?  I know this is funny to every city because there's a jock in every city that does this hokey radio crap.  Oh, totally.  Please.  There was a videotape of his wedding.  He did this phone, another one of the long line of phony bits where he was getting married and he gets to the altar.  And it's like, do you take this woman, blah, blah, blah.  He's like, no, I got to go.  And he turns around and walks out and everyone's shocked.  And the rest of the air staff, the spineless air staff over there, because Dave Dickless told him they have to be part of this, how to sit down and make like they were shocked that that rock hole was leaving his wedding. 
[02:34:00]  Do you honestly, well, they were part of the wedding party.  Yeah, part of the wedding party.  None of those guys like each other.  But for this bit, you all get along.  Oh, you all get along, right.  Ugh.  Shaky camera footage that, oh, my God, even the cameraman, Ian, was upset.  Oh, my God. 
[02:34:30]  Ugh.  Enough.  Dude, don't talk about Ian, because they don't call me at home and cry like a little girl.  Hey, man, I don't like when you make fun of me and my real rock TV.  Toss.  You know, I don't even need to do this anymore, because I'm hanging with Godsmack.  I help them out on a project, man.  I'm just doing this in my spare time.  I'm leaving my wedding.  And look, Dave's going to try to talk me into leaving the wedding.  This is great stuff.  Ugh.  Holy crap. 
[02:35:00]  Step back, guy, man.  It's just, it's between me and Oak.  I'll punch you in the nose.  Remember?  The Godsmack show?  Yeah.  The fight.  Back off, guy.  It's between me and Oak.  What's that loser's name?  Is that Ian?  Ian, yeah.  Ian with his crappy TV show that's horrendous that no one watches.  Unfannish television.  Yeah.  I thought they would have at least upgraded.  It's been, what, four years since we've been there.  Dude, I work for Godsmack. 
[02:35:30]  Now, one of my friends almost killed that dude that night when he was messing with you.  He was ready to kill me.  All right.  A lot of fun, though.  There you go.  That's his latest.  We've got to talk about Clinton before we get out of here.  And a little bit of, what did we learn, Ant?  All right.  Okay.  And one of us in the studio will be breaking up with our girlfriend next.  Yeah.  Stay tuned, that bitch.  It'll be up to you to figure out who.  You know, we're going to be pulling over a bus on the street, and I'm going to be looking for a new chick. 
[02:36:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:36:30]  Ah, Anthony, Rockaway Bedding.  Rockaway Bedding.  It's the fastest growing mattress.  A chain store in New York, Jersey.  Hello, Rockaway Bedding.  Can you take away my stained mattress?  I don't need it anymore.  I need a new mattress for my new chick that I'll be picking this weekend.  Rockaway Bedding.  They got all the brand name mattresses.  Sealy, Pudger, Beedick, Simmons, Beautyrest, and Sirta Perfect Sleeper for all my new bitches.  And for two for Tuesday, I'm going to pick two new girlfriends because I'm so wild. 
[02:37:00]  First chick that pulls the tag off the mattress is my new chick.  Rockaway Bedding.  You got to shop there.  That's right.  They have, what, the free steel bed frame, free delivery, free complete removal of your old disgusting mattresses.  They treat you good.  They got all the brand name mattresses, and you're going to save a lot of money.  Call them up.  1-800-TRY-A-BED.  1-800-TRY-A-BED for the nearest store. 
[02:37:30]  Rockaway Bedding.  The Clinton thing will have to wait until tomorrow.  Damn it.  He really has nothing to do with his life.  Cute little story in the paper today.  We'll have it first thing tomorrow.  What did we learn on the show today, Anthony?  Very educational program, I believe.  I think so.  Yeah.  A lot about freaks.  Frank, what did you learn on the show? 
[02:38:00]  I actually learned two things today.  Number one, hairy woman was married to tall man.  And number two, effing a two-headed girl is like having a threesome.  Very good.  But hairy woman was married to alligator man.  If we review the tapes, you will see that you told us it was hairy woman and tall man.  No, no, no, no.  It was alligator man, hairy woman.  And then we realized tall man was married to half woman.  Right.  So would they have a hairy alligator? 
[02:38:30]  I don't get the whole thing.  You've got to see the pictures, man.  They've been all over.  Put them up.  Look up the link with us, you know what I mean?  All right, Frank.  Thank you.  Cool, man.  All right.  Beavis writes, today I learned I have a lot of questions for the girl with two heads.  Yes.  Who doesn't?  The sexual questions, they are unlimited.  Erneo from Jersey.  I learned today on the show we're actually missing great O&A bits  when the station cuts to those best ofs.  Damn them. 
[02:39:00]  I didn't know they were doing that.  We'll fix that problem.  See, we already did, actually.  You see, it didn't happen today.  That's right.  Because we all got enough sleep last night.  Barely.  John, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, I learned that Opie still carries things in a book bag.  That's right.  And that prize-sucking pigs, even if they have big racks, don't get prized.  Very good.  Opie, I went to a spinal tap last night.  No, you didn't.  Don't confuse the fine fellas. 
[02:39:30]  And ladies out there, look who's hanging with us today.  It's Jim Brewer.  No, he's not.  Walk it off, dig.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Long time fan.  What I learned on O&A today, that even a chick with nice-looking fun bags doesn't qualify to win a DVD player.  Exactly.  We showed we have morals today.  Thank God.  Got to stand up sometimes.  Very good, Mike.  Anthony, what did you learn today?  Nothing.  I learned a bunch of things.  Fat teen girls on talk show, always funny. 
[02:40:00]  Always funny.  Fake breaking up bits, always bad.  Always bad.  And Anthony still gets nightmares.  A lot of people are going, why would you talk about what another show is doing?  Because that's going to make everyone tune to that station.  Just so people can, you know, listen to the fakeness of the whole damn thing.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're next on the O&A show.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that you can't run the first base when you're attached to the catcher.  And three right, still make a left.  Absolutely.  Hey, that's good, bro. 
[02:40:30]  Thank you.  Let's go to Brian.  Hey, Brian, what did you learn, man?  I learned that there's one more dangerous thing to look out for in your mail other than anthrax.  It's Yankee fever.  Yankee fever.  How you doing?  How you doing?  Oh, B.  How you doing?  Sports curse.  How you doing?  Oh, oh.  Bill, what's up?  Oh, man, you guys are hilarious.  You got to come to D.C.  We're going to.  You guys are killing me.  I mean, I'm physically wincing at some of the stuff you guys tell people in the air. 
[02:41:00]  It's absolutely hilarious.  It's not like the winch.  We like people that winch.  It's great, guys.  Thanks.  We call it cringe radio.  Thank you very much, man.  You guys are great.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Dave for the Daily Rick Abuse.  David?  Hey, Dave.  No, David.  What's up, Owen?  Hey.  What's up, man?  Rick will always notice and point out man junk.  That's true.  Yeah, Rick, you were a little too quick with that, man.  I know it was the toughest time in today, but.  All right.  They're almost naked.  They're almost naked.  Oh, a peeler and a regular. 
[02:41:30]  Right.  Sheep lover.  I learned today, topless more funny than not topless unless topless costs a DVD player.  And see, you guys still funny without Norton.  Oh, we have Norton around because we like him.  We like having Norton around.  Yeah.  Nothing to that, really.  Where are we going?  What?  What?  Oh, okay.  Rob, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  Speaking of topless, I learned that Louis Black topless equals more gooder. 
[02:42:00]  Hey, guys.  There you go.  Yes, Rob.  When are we going to see the P-boy and 11-year-old gallery play date?  That's not a bad idea.  I've got to hook him up with a play date.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thanks a lot, guys.  I'm you.  All right.  He rules.  Sure.  Danielle from Alabama.  Syndication on the ground.  I learned today that Opie took Custer plus the points against Little Bighorn. 
[02:42:30]  Rick has more balls in his face than Yogi Berra.  And Spuds Buckley never got to drink with Curt Schilling.  Right.  She was listening.  I think we're done.  Dom from Brooklyn.  I learned that the other one belongs to Arlo.  Boy, you are listening, man.  Brian, what did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned that the real winner of the Yankee giveaway contest was Rick because he effing  loved looking at all that man junk. 
[02:43:00]  All right, guys.  You guys suck.  Rick, the real winner today.  Yes.  Jeez.  Rick was ready to get naked for the DVD player.  That's great.  I learned that Anne's impression of Lisa Orban sounds a lot like a dirt bike. 
[02:43:30]  You know who wrote that?  Fresca's Ghost from Huntington.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Anne, money talks and fault walks.  All right.  We're dumpski.  Ben said it, so I just followed this little thing.  Okay, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow for more opiate abuse about the Diamondbacks.  Well, Friday.  Right?  I think we got a bang-up show for tomorrow, man.  We really do, and we can't talk about it now because we're late. 
[02:44:00]  So thanks for listening.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Three.  Hi, we're here under your skin.  Us two A-holes.  Hello.  Opie and Anthony.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.
