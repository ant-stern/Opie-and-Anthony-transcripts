<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly between segments and discussions.  The show began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jimmy Norton detailing their challenging morning routines and complaining about the early start time for their radio show.  They extensively commented on a local news reporter, Jill Nicolini ("Jill TV"), who had appeared in a roller derby segment on her traffic report.  Norton recounted a disastrous stand-up comedy performance at The Comedy Cellar.  Several recurring Thursday segments were featured, including "Fun Fact Thursday," "Mail Camel Toe Thursday," "Perv News Thursday," and "Phone Call Thursday," the latter of which received numerous calls simply acknowledging the day.  News items such as the Chris Benoit murder-suicide and Paris Hilton's appearance on Larry King were briefly discussed, along with complaints about newspapers spoiling DVR'd shows, and a running gag about "Casual Kenny." The hosts also promoted their upcoming comedy tour.

The Benoit murder-suicide became a significant focus, with speculation on Benoit's potential motivations, including the possibility of shame over his son's Fragile X syndrome, steroid use, and a recent WWE demotion.  The discussion extended to a broader conversation about the effects of various drugs and substances, comparing societal acceptance with their potential harm.

A bizarre and extended segment followed, centered around a dairy-free ice cream sandwich, the "Tofutie Cutie," leading to graphic discussions of flatulence and bodily functions, with both hosts and a studio guest, Sam, sharing explicit details.  Listeners also called in with similar graphic anecdotes.  This segment also included a prank call, ostensibly from Louis Black (later revealed to be Norton), who only meowed, and a seemingly genuine call from Jerry Springer, discussing his show and a controversial episode featuring self-mutilation.  "Fun Fact Thursday" continued, offering facts such as ballpoint pen choking deaths.  The "Phone Call Thursday" segment was disrupted by the Tofutie Cutie discussion and prank calls.  The hosts briefly mentioned upcoming segments and a live broadcast from the Mohegan Sun, and touched upon an E-Rock weight loss bet with Dr. Ian Smith.

The show then delved into a detailed discussion of the evolution of Jerry Springer's show, its transition to sensationalism, and NBCUniversal's influence. Springer's account of outlandish moments, including the "I Married My Horse" episode, was recounted.  A critical, vulgar analysis of a Paris Hilton interview on Larry King Live followed, focusing on King's allegedly overly-suggestive questions about Hilton's jail strip search.  The hosts heavily criticized West Palm Beach radio host Dick Farrell for a negative article about them, providing his contact information for listeners. The segment concluded with a weighing of E-Rock as part of his weight loss bet. A caller from Portland was also mentioned, prompting further suggestive jokes.

A discussion about the perceived double standard in media treatment of men who demean black women compared to others followed, using highly offensive language and stereotypes. This was interspersed with listener calls, including one featuring pumpkin pie pranks, an attempted stand-up routine by a caller named Jimmy, and a caller performing a "rock scream."  A woman named Sarah, from Portland, Oregon, joined them in studio, leading to sexually explicit conversations with her and her boyfriend about their sex lives and the hosts' attempts to have her appear topless on air, encountering resistance from CBS studio management due to nudity restrictions. This segment included further sexually explicit conversations, complaints about CBS management, and attempts to find loopholes in CBS's policies.

The show concluded with a discussion about spanking, including graphic descriptions of technique, intensity, and reactions. This transitioned into a "line of the day" segment featuring crude and sexually suggestive jokes.  The hosts also mentioned upcoming events, including a show at Mohegan Sun featuring Louis CK and other comedians.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their audience.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice? 
[00:00:30]  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial Radio Personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk Show Radio Hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What? Hold on. Whose fault was that delay? 
[00:01:00]  No. Oh, is it?  Correct, open, humiliated. What do you mean right in front of me?  When you just end like that, I had to tie it up. Dude, I looked at you and went, boom, like, go.  That was sloppy. If you had to say a celebrity that you most  resemble, who would you say? Jodie Foster? If she ate the real Jodie Foster.  Silence of the hands. This is where entertainment is going.  I do not touch that. The only things that may touch that  is toilet paper and baby wipes. I am right now.  Oh, my God. They are sick freaks. 
[00:01:30]  How close did you get to having relations with a dog?  You have to put oven mitts on all the German shepherds so they don't scratch my job.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, lots to do today.  Oh, sorry. Lots to do today.  Hi, good morning. 
[00:02:00]  We kind of forget that we're waking you up for the first time.  Gently. I think our wake-up should be a gentle little nudge like,  wake up, wake up, wake up, baby.  Come on, baby. Stroke the hair.  I'm stroking your hair, listeners.  Hi. Come on.  Oh, wait. Your butt's peeking out from under the sheet.  I'm going to bite it.  I keep forgetting that we've been up for two hours, so.  Yeah.  We come out of the box with a lot of energy, but there are people, they set their alarms to this crap. 
[00:02:30]  They're a little groggy.  Groggy.  A bit groggy.  Think how you feel when you're sitting on the edge of the bed after the alarm's gone off and you're just kind of like,  oh, God, I am exhausted.  Oh, I don't feel that way.  No?  No, I'm just in shock.  That you're getting up?  I don't even know if I'm tired, well-rested.  I have no clue anymore.  You know what I don't like?  The alarm goes off and I'm just in shock. 
[00:03:00]  I don't like the no choice in the matter thing.  No kidding.  I was thinking about that this morning, actually.  Like, when you wake up, there's no, you know something, I'm just going to sleep for another hour.  No.  An hour in relative terms isn't much, but you can't do it.  You're just like, I'd like to sleep another hour.  No.  You have to get, and I look at the clock and it's like, another minute's ticked away.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I got to get dressed.  I was thinking about that this morning.  We're on the same page.  It's just exactly what I'm thinking in the morning. 
[00:03:30]  A lot of people, you know, they're waking up now, but they don't have to get out of bed  until maybe 6.30.  Yeah.  Because we get up so early, we have figured it out to the second.  You're so right.  So as soon as I hear that alarm, up, shower on, brushing teeth, and washing all at the  same time.  Like, within seconds of the alarm going off, I have to.  Yeah, there's no choice.  Because, you know, we've been doing this for, what, close to three years now.  I used to wake up at four.  I'm like, why am I getting up at four? 
[00:04:00]  You know, we want to be at the station by five is what we go for.  So it's like four.  Like, I'm sitting around the house at 4.20 with nothing to do.  All right, I'll sleep to 4.10, 4.15, 4.20.  I got it down to the second now.  If I get up at 4.35.  4.35!  I'm at my desk, showered, already, you know, took my time in the bathroom, let's say.  Uh, teeth brushed, floss, I even floss in the morning. 
[00:04:30]  What?  Wow, what a champ.  It's still here by five.  But, when that alarm goes off, it's action.  Yeah, you gotta get moving.  And action!  Immediately.  Do you remember day one when we started mornings?  I think I got up at 2.30.  Oh, good God.  I got up at 2.30 in the morning, gotta get ready, don't want to be late, gotta commute,  gotta do this, and I was in, just sitting around the office, hmm, all right, got three  hours before the show starts.  We're just really stupid. 
[00:05:00]  Of course.  Every other guy that's done morning radio, they started doing morning radio when they  were 20, 22, 25, whatever.  Yeah.  We start doing morning radio late in our careers.  Yeah.  It's just dumb.  Yeah.  It's a time slot for the young.  It really is.  I don't know.  I never liked getting up, so I was constantly losing jobs.  Yeah.  Because I couldn't get up and even be to work by 8.  8 o'clock now is like... 
[00:05:30]  Oh, God.  Oh.  If we have a day off, I wake up at 8 and go, oh, my God, did I sleep in.  Yeah.  Oh, look at me.  Yeah, that's me sleeping in on weekends.  8, 9.  Old jobs.  I was the guy all the time.  Yeah.  Hello.  Yeah, I'm going to be a little late today.  There's car trouble.  Oh, yeah?  What's with your voice?  I think I'm getting a sore throat.  No, I've been up for hours trying to get the car started.  No, you got all confused.  Morning throat.  You panicked.  Panicked. 
[00:06:00]  You're supposed to do the sick voice, but went with the car excuse with the sick voice.  No, no.  You heard my voice on the old BAB tapes.  I was constantly, like, raspy because of the band and everything like that.  And when I woke up every morning, my voice was like this.  I could barely talk whether I was sick or not.  But I didn't want to call in sick all the time.  So I would say, yeah, well, I'm having trouble getting the van started.  Why is your voice like that?  Oh, yeah, sore throat.  Yeah, that's it.  That's what it is.  And meanwhile, I just woke up and grabbed the phone. 
[00:06:30]  The first thing I did was grab the phone.  I was asleep five seconds before I talked to my boss.  Of course.  Well, good morning to everybody.  Good morning.  We got to start.  We want to talk to Jimmy because he has a quick little story from last night.  But, Jimmy, we have to talk about Jill TV.  I'm really sorry.  Jill TV.  Jill TV is in full effect today.  If you're a newbie to this whole Jill TV thing, we got a flat screen.  We got flat screens all over our studio here in New York. 
[00:07:00]  And one of the TVs we dedicated to Jill TV.  It's the hot traffic girl from Channel 11 locally here in New York.  Yeah.  And this morning on Jill TV, they decided it wasn't good enough to have her just doing traffic in a hot outfit.  By the way, since we've been keeping track of what she wears, she hasn't worn the same thing twice yet.  No.  And it's been weeks.  Today, she was pretty much wearing a bustier doing the traffic report.  Yeah.  It was stunning.  It really was stunning.  And they said, ah, that's not good enough for our viewers. 
[00:07:30]  We need Jill TV or Jill Nicolini doing roller derby.  Roller derby.  They had her in shorts and on roller skates.  And she was doing roller derby.  Roller derby with a flat-chested broad.  Oh, it was great.  Look at these pictures that E-Rock is showing.  Are these going to be up on the website, E-Rock?  Yeah, yeah.  It is so sexy. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  There she is putting her skates on.  Well, she's got the old school shorts on that are coming back.  Yeah.  I don't know what they were called, but like Tire Fawcett, I think, used to wear them back in the day.  Just picture any of the roller disco episodes of like Chips.  Sure.  Chips had a roller disco episode.  I believe Family, the show Family, had a roller disco episode.  It's those shorts.  The Cheryl Teagues shorts.  And they are making a comeback.  And a tiny little tank top that is trying to hold everything. 
[00:08:30]  Really accentuates her assets.  As E-Rock zooms in on the chest shot.  I was very worried about it this morning.  I don't like this activity stuff.  There could be an injury.  Yes, I would not like to see her get hurt.  And there she is on Jill TV.  Yeah.  And I like the sign.  We actually have a sign that goes the entire length of the flat screen television, which is just giant.  And it says Jill TV and there are two hearts on either side.  And there she is wearing a bustier. 
[00:09:00]  It's like some kind of a – what is that?  What is it actually called?  Nice.  It's cinched up real nice.  What?  What?  What?  Like what she's wearing, that top.  It's just a tank top, no?  Yeah.  Oh, oh.  We're back to live.  Yeah.  Where she's now in her stripper clothes to do with traffic.  She's in like the stripper clothes, like the clothes strippers wear as they go to work.  As they're coming in the door and you go – you're finishing up your beer and she walks in and you go, all right, I got to stay for another beer. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I got to see her dance.  And you know there's just nothing but goodness under what she's wearing on TV.  I don't like this dangerous stunt thing.  I want her like on a trampoline surrounded by feather pillows like in like a little negligee just yelling teehee and doing the weather.  Oh, E-Rock.  Wow.  Look at that shot.  Yeah.  Why roller derby?  It's the local –  Because it's sexy.  She's wearing little shorts.  You know what?  She's roller skating and she's getting like – she's getting tough with some other brawns. 
[00:10:00]  She threw down her helmet and she was going to throw.  Someone is suggesting Kevin from Connecticut.  Great view.  You know what else that view is right there?  Yeah, that's the view you get.  Right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it's a camera view that's above her and she's looking up at the –  Into your eyes.  Yeah.  Wow.  As she takes a break from taking care of business.  Yeah, but there's a helmet on her head.  That would creep me out.  Well, speaking of helmets.  Helmet on her head, in her head. 
[00:10:30]  Kevin from Connecticut.  Keep it clean.  Keep it clean.  I hear Jill Nicolini's family is big supporters of the O.K.  We are big supporters of Jill Nicolini.  I hear her brother's a huge fan of the show.  Well, let me tell her brother this.  Do you have naked pictures of her?  She's –  We'll pay handsomely.  She and I email each other.  I think that there's something brewing.  Oh, really?  That's in my opinion.  Yeah.  A little something brewing.  Brewing.  We look forward to the day that we get her on the show.  So, Kevin from Connecticut is suggesting that she's wearing 1979 NBA shorts. 
[00:11:00]  Oh, there you go.  That's a good one.  Yeah.  She's wearing kind of like James Worthy shorts.  Yeah.  They show everything.  Oh.  It's –  Oh, Linda.  She's nice.  Linda Church.  Roll the blade, but she refused to wear a helmet so they threw her out.  You know, we're hypocrites, though.  Any other local news channel does roller derby.  We'd be all over them.  Oh, we'd be going, this isn't the news.  We'd be like, do you know there's a war going on?  There's a war on, and they're doing roller derby? 
[00:11:30]  Right.  We're like, Jill, more roller derby.  What's with this?  Who cares what happened?  Put Jill on skates and push her around.  Hey, we're hypocrites like anyone else out there, man.  Let's be honest.  We know that.  So, what's up, Jimmy?  Hi.  Jimmy was telling us just before the show that you bombed at the cellar.  I can't fathom this.  I want to bring everyone.  I've seen Jimmy, and he's brilliant.  People adore him.  You're very charismatic on stage. 
[00:12:00]  And the girls like you because you're so cuddly.  Well, let me.  And I can't picture him getting on stage and bombing.  Well, I'll tell you.  The comedy cellar here in New York City, this is where a lot of the guys that do our show,  they work out their material on a regular basis almost every night.  It's a great comedy club in the village.  All the big comics stop in there, too, and work out new stuff.  All of a sudden, Seinfeld could be on that stage, or Robin Williams, Chris Rock.  And these guys, there's a whole lineup.  I'm just trying to set up Jimmy here.  There's a whole lineup of comedians.  There could be easily 10 comedians in a night, right? 
[00:12:30]  Yeah.  8 to 10 comedians that all pretty much headline on their own when they're not at the cellar.  This is their hometown club.  So, Jimmy was at the cellar last night like he is pretty much any night of the week.  You only do 15, 20 minutes on weeknights, and I'm just working on material.  I shot the HBO special, so it's like, well, in October when that comes out, that's an hour of material I can't do.  So I've got to go work out material.  You know, traveling virus, you're going to burn some material.  So I'm working it out.  I'm going out with paper.  And it was a full crowd last night. 
[00:13:00]  You went out with some sheets of paper, man.  I knew it was going to be awful because The Will is a black guy.  He's a host.  And then Keith Robinson was on.  So I walked out.  I mean, they're both friends of mine.  And I walk on, and I go, have a nice hand for Will and for Keith and anybody white who might have been up here.  Nothing.  And as soon as I heard that, they're hypersensitive.  I knew they were going to be babies.  Oh, no.  And I started doing my material.  And there's something I do about a fat girl, which is not nice.  Of course. 
[00:13:30]  And they groaned at me, so I just got really mean.  Jimmy hates the groan.  It's hilarious.  When an audience goes, oh, oh, oh.  But as a friend of mine.  You're so upset.  But as a friend of Jimmy Norton, it's some of the coolest stuff you could ever see when he just decides to beat up a crowd.  Just destroys the crowd on a personal level.  And all they want to do is have a few laughs and a pitcher of beer in some way.  A few laughs.  They have no idea what they're getting into if they do the old groan to Jim Norton. 
[00:14:00]  Florentine used to sit like – and we did this to Voss one time.  He'll sit in the crowd while you're on, and you'll do a tasteless joke, and Florentine will go, oh, man.  And he'll try to get the crowd to groan just so you attack them.  What a bastard.  Me and Florentine sat in Caroline's one time, and sometime when it's not full, they curtain it off.  And Voss was on stage years ago, and it was curtain it off.  He probably had like 150 people there.  Jim's on one side of the curtain.  I'm maybe 80 feet away on the other side.  So we're kind of in a triangulation from the audience looking at Voss. 
[00:14:30]  And we're both – everything he said, one of us is going, oh, where Jim's like, come on.  And when people hear that, they're like, oh.  And Voss was – his set was ruined.  What, what, what?  He was trying to be like poignant and angry.  It was really – you guys suck.  Yeah, but they were booing last night.  It was really –  Booing you?  Not the whole crowd, but they were like, boo.  Because I was doing I'm this material, and they just – they were just being – they objected to it because – 
[00:15:00]  Oh, I'm offended.  Well, you got to –  And don't come into a comedy club.  You got to let the people know.  You know, you get some of the comedy – some of those college douches in that club.  That's right by NYU.  And normally they're fine, but you're going to – like last night they were just –  That was a general statement, obviously.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But the NYU crowd is a little – it's a little rough.  You're going to get these idealistic young people thinking, you know, this man, we need more tolerance, man.  Shut up.  It's a comedy show.  Yeah, they really are – I was really hypersensitive last night. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, screw.  Yeah, they – I ruined their night.  How about it's insensitive and mean to throw yourself out a window.  You might hit somebody on the sidewalk.  Exactly.  Learn your arithmetic and be a good boy.  Right.  Stop jumping.  So did you spit on the stage like you like to do?  No, I really didn't.  I walked – this woman – I got heckled by one woman.  I said something.  One of the lines I say is, why do you think I'm a comedian?  Because I got mm all the time, like sarcastically saying I never played.  And after I said that, some woman yelled out, that's what I'm trying to figure out, like why I'm a comedian. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Who was this – how do you deal with that without getting off the stage with a smile on your face,  walking over to her like you're going to, like, shake your hand and punching her in the face?  Well, I started to address her.  I wasn't even that mad at it.  And then a woman said something else, and she yelled, next, from the other side of the room.  Next?  Yeah.  And then I got –  Like your time is done, sir, because I say so?  Yeah.  Oh.  Bring on the next monkey to entertain us. 
[00:16:30]  How?  The next organ grinder?  Right, right, right.  So what did you do?  I said some really unpleasant things to her.  Oh, good for you.  It implied that she'll be picking up her chewing gum off the floor of a peep booth.  It wasn't a pleasant interaction.  Good for you.  That's the best part, because he makes the whole room uncomfortable.  But it's almost –  And that's what I don't understand about you, because when I make people uncomfortable on the radio show,  you, like, cringe and get really, like – you want to hide, but you do the same thing on a stage.  Live.  Live in front of, like, 100, 200 people. 
[00:17:00]  So I've seen you do it in front of, like, a really big crowd.  Because I do it to them because they deserve it.  People come in here who might be putting away –  All right, all right.  They just try to be –  They're just nervous and scared, trying to promote.  I'm doing it to people who somehow think they're part of a creative process.  Right.  All right, good point.  Personally insulting you and what you do.  You're basically saying I go after the weak.  No, but people aren't deserving.  They're not weak.  They've done nothing.  They're just trying to be something.  Hi, I'm a fan. 
[00:17:30]  Are you?  I'm a fat fan.  And then it just starts with the unpleasant comments.  Jim's laying his teeth into a gazelle that's running at full bore.  Yeah.  And, well, you're kind of like – this one's leg has been twisted.  It's a baby.  It's a – yeah.  The rest of the herds run off.  Yeah, he's –  And you just kind of can saunter up and bite its head off.  Speaking of which, Steve the Whistler.  Oh, yeah.  He lives in the neighborhood.  I keep forgetting to tell you guys.  You see him?  I walk by him all the time, and he knows who I am. 
[00:18:00]  Invite him on the show.  Oh, no.  And I saw him leaving his apartment.  I know exactly where he is.  Was he whistling?  He left his apartment whistling.  Swear to God.  Constantly whistling.  That's one for the old listeners.  But, yeah, I see him all the time.  It's always awkward.  Not for me.  Well, yeah, I guess –  Wait, the new neighborhood?  No.  All the –  Well, our neighborhood.  It's still kind of the same neighborhood, right?  Yeah, but, I mean, like, I don't know if I live.  All right.  Anyway, we're just getting started.  Hope and I are real neighbors now. 
[00:18:30]  We're always kind of close, but we're, like, literally –  I bumped into him just walking out the door yesterday.  Yeah.  Where I sleep with my wife.  Where my children come to play with their toys.  Yeah, I'm scared.  My neighborhood?  I'm scared to be Jimmy's neighbor.  Yeah.  That's what I'm going to see.  You won't see anything.  Coming and going from that building.  If late at night or night you see a car driving into my building,  and there's a beautiful girl, you're like,  that's not Jim's girlfriend.  Much taller girl with what appears to be a wig.  You're just tired, and you get sleepies in your eyes.  I've got large hands on that woman. 
[00:19:00]  She's plombing a basketball.  Is that Shaq?  All right.  We've got a lot to do.  Of course, it's a very busy day.  We will tell you all the themes for Thursday after the break.  Oh, God.  One, two, three.  We've got four themes for Thursday.  I'm hoping to cull it down to at least three.  We've got some audio from Jill TV.  Yeah.  The roller derby audio should be at our side in a few minutes here.  And do you want to talk about, there's a lot of stuff going on.  DVR is wrecking. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, we'll get into that.  It's being wrecked by the newspapers.  The newspapers are ruining TV shows that we all DVR.  We'll get into that.  Absolutely.  Paris Hilton on Larry King.  Larry King is a perv.  I'm a pervert.  We'll get into that.  Also, an update on the Chris Benoit situation.  Every day stuff comes out about this guy.  What a creep.  Yeah.  Oof.  He might be taking down the whole company.  Nah.  Oh, man.  We've got details on that.  Well, a lot of scandal going to be going on about the steroid. 
[00:20:00]  One of those things we just mentioned we'll talk about next.  How's that?  One of them.  Or probably not.  Yeah.  We'll go off on a tear in some other area and never get to any of those.  Thank you.  Anyone else creeped out by Casual Kenny?  I'm Casual Traveling Kenny.  I don't know what his name is right now, Casual Kenny.  Yes, I am.  Casual Kenny.  Obviously, we're hitting the road today because Kenny is all casual.  It's a travel day.  He's wearing perfectly brand new white sneakers. 
[00:20:30]  If he wasn't 6'5 and a potential murderer, I'd throw coffee on his shoes.  But then he might forget we're friends.  That'd be great.  What do you mean potential?  He's wearing an Air Force shirt.  Yep.  Air Force shirt is cool.  Into the wild blue yonder.  He's in like a plane, a jet flying over enemy territory, but his big head is poking through.  Is there any wind in his face?  Casual Kenny is creepy.  I like you all dressed up like you do. 
[00:21:00]  All right.  I'm sorry.  It's all right.  But we're traveling to Mohegan Sun right after the show today.  Tumbleweed Head 1.  I need permission to fire.  Permission to engage target.  This is Tumbleweed Head 1.  Tumbleweed Head 1.  That's going to be denied.  You have to take off first.  Oh, thank you.  Okay.  I forgot the keys to this thing. 
[00:21:30]  You know, these jets can be very dangerous.  You know, I don't want to say anything, but some of these bombs could hurt people.  I love this one, too.  I hate to be the bearer of bad news.  Do you?  Do you really?  Your smile is not indicative of how you hate to be the bearer of such news.  Oh, he can't wait to tell me the day's bad news every morning.  He's the great one.  He picks me up.  There won't be any bad news at the Mohegan Sun this week.  No, good news for all. 
[00:22:00]  He even makes blueberries depressing.  I'll get into his truck and go, bad news, G.H.  The blueberries didn't look good this morning.  I can't wait to tell me the blueberries are bad.  I'm thinking it's something horrific about our comedy tour or something.  G.H., you better sit down for this one.  Whoa, what happened?  What the?  It's the blueberries. 
[00:22:30]  You know how you like them a bit cloudy?  Cloudy?  I didn't see any clouds in the latest batch of blueberries.  The blueberry prices are coming down.  Yeah, that's right.  Hey, look at that.  Good news.  I'm looking into buying some blueberry futures.  Vince McMahon might want to do that.  That's one of the many things we'll look into after we take a little breather.  All right, cool.  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:23:00]  Ah, good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony, little Jimmy Norton.  We're all getting excited here because we hit the road right after the show today.  Don't forget, broadcasting live from the Wolf Den tomorrow.  It's the lead up to the big O&A Travel and Virus Comedy Tour hitting Mohegan Sun this Saturday.  Nine comedians from the show.  You know most of the guys, I'm sure.  All the info can be found on Virus Tour, one word on MySpace. 
[00:23:30]  Who's going to be there tomorrow?  Do we have any comics coming up?  Louis C.K. is bringing his entire family up just so he can do the show with us tomorrow live  in front of three or four hundred listeners.  What a trooper.  At the Wolf Den, yeah.  Keep listening to the Wolf for details.  Is Bobby or Patrice or any of those guys coming?  Most of the guys aren't coming up until Saturday.  We'll still have a really good time at the Wolf Den tomorrow morning.  All right?  All right.  All right.  Let me lay it out for everybody today.  Today is a very, very busy day. 
[00:24:00]  It's Fun Fact Thursday.  That means we're guaranteed to give you at least one fun fact.  Fun fact.  Now, these are facts that you can then go to your workplace with and tell other people,  and they'll go, really?  Wow.  And it'll brighten their day.  Yeah.  It's a fun fact.  That's right.  Also, it's Mail Camel Toe Thursday.  Mail Camel Toe Thursday.  Just, if you want, around your workplace, men only. 
[00:24:30]  I'm sorry, women.  But you have camel toes anyway.  We might let you have a day on Tuesday or something.  Yeah.  But this is for men.  Take the front of your pants, whatever you're wearing.  The looser, the better, though.  And then pull them up real tight in the front until it leaves what is known as a camel toe.  Oh, yeah.  You see sort of a crease in your pants in a very sensitive place when you pull them up real tight. 
[00:25:00]  Mail Camel Toe on Thursday.  You've got to split the junk right down the middle to get it perfect.  Even Steven on either side.  But try it around the workplace.  Yeah, it'll get laughed.  You'll be a hit.  You will get laughed.  And do the old school impression where you have to turn around first.  Yeah, yeah.  Turn around.  You don't want people seeing how you do it.  Turn around.  Get ready.  Face your coworkers.  Yeah.  Then again, human resources will be calling immediately. 
[00:25:30]  But what the hell?  Well, no, no.  This is fun.  This isn't any kind of harassment.  You know, prepare yourself.  Then turn around.  Face your coworkers and go, guess what I am.  And they'll be clueless.  And then you'll say something like, I'm a chick.  See?  Look.  Yeah.  Do it to the new temp secretary.  Yeah.  Do it to her.  Walk right up to her face and do it.  And she'll get a laugh out of it.  Believe me.  Well, put the thumb through the hole.  Like, do your zipper down.  You put your thumb through.  And you go, hey, bitch.  It's Fonzie.  Hey. 
[00:26:00]  There are just some things you cannot get away with in the workplace anymore.  Anymore.  Thank you.  I'm glad you said that.  You used to be able to.  You know, people thought you could just put up the naked lady pictures in your cubicle.  Yeah.  The sexy things.  Ah, the calendars.  The calendars.  Yeah, that was always a big thing.  Even in garages, they've made them take them down where the mechanics are working.  And in their toolbox, they have the Snap-on Tools calendar.  Ah, they don't let them do that anymore because someone might see it and be offended. 
[00:26:30]  Please.  That's it.  Drop your drawers like Jimmy does and spread them.  That's it.  And just make it talk.  Go, hello, secretary.  How are you today?  You don't have to hide your mouth because they won't be seeing it.  You can just use your mouth.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, but it would sound like this because the mouth isn't shaped quite right.  I don't know if that part of your body can enunciate.  By the way, Thanh is handing me a note.  But the only person that's allowed to have a girly calendar still in his office is Tank. 
[00:27:00]  Tank.  He's got one.  Tank, the sports guy at the radio station.  You know, let me tell you what happened yesterday.  I walked into Tank's office and, oh, was I offended at what he had.  He had a calendar with bikini girls on it.  Oh, you're kidding.  It's the girls of LSU.  Wow.  Of course, it's got to be.  Now, Tank, why would you do that when you know it upsets Kathy? 
[00:27:30]  I was beside myself.  We've just decided that Tank works for the York and Kathy show.  Why not?  There's somebody like that.  Just so we can continue to be local for Chicago.  Ah, what do you think of her, huh?  What a set of stems.  Using 40s terminology.  Yeah, stems.  Oh, well, Anthony's warming up his Larry King impression.  It's going to be a dude's day.  Larry.  All right.  So then it's, yeah, male camel toe Thursday.  Then, of course, a very popular feature. 
[00:28:00]  Hey, wait, wait, wait.  Before you announce another feature.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Did you know you cannot fold a piece of paper in half more than seven times?  Fun fact.  What else?  It's Fun Fact Thursday.  Just handing them out.  Let's not go crazy with the fun facts.  Try it.  Well, now you've got people trying it.  Okay, we'll wait.  All right.  So it's male camel toe Thursday.  Yes. 
[00:28:30]  Perv News Thursday.  Perv News Thursday.  I don't think we got to it last Thursday.  Well, we noticed with this radio show, some of these features are actually real features  we're into now.  They all are.  Oh, yeah.  Perv News Thursday.  We noticed there's a perv in the news every day at this point.  Yes.  So we collect all the stories and give you one big segment that's called Perv News.  Perv News.  And we do it on Thursday.  How many stories we got today?  At least three.  At least three?  At least three.  And also, it's cat meow Thursday.  No, it isn't.  What did I tell you about that? 
[00:29:00]  The stupid cat thing was Wednesday, and we're acing that one.  We're getting rid of it.  People like cat meow Thursday.  No.  No, they don't.  They hate that feature.  We got sweepers for Perv News Thursday.  Oh.  Oh.  It's Perv News Thursday.  Oh, no.  Not again.  Oh.  And then, see, then you got to bed.  Yeah.  In Perv News.  But this one kind of bothers me because you never say it's Perv News Thursday at the end 
[00:29:30]  of it there, Steve.  Oh.  Soon, a man appears wearing a red cap.  Uh-oh.  I'm in trouble here.  One signal, he's there for sex.  Hey, what?  The deputies say he exposed himself three times during a canoeing trip.  Hey, look at my...  He walks naked with a ski mask covering his face.  Hey.  Now they say he's hiding on court, looking through windows.  Right next.  Opie and Anthony.  They're men hunting for another man to have sex with. 
[00:30:00]  What the F, Steve?  How about Perv News Thursday?  Keep your homosexuality out of our freaking promos.  That's not mine.  That was Derek's.  Well, Derek's going to get a beating.  That was Derek's.  How about you let everyone in on the joke at the end of the thing?  Derek, quit Perv News Thursday at the end of that.  How about a just kidding, it's Perv News Thursday something?  Perv News Thursday.  You'll leave the listeners hanging that Dan and I are searching for other men to have  sex with.  Of course.  Everyone knows Opie isn't involved in that. 
[00:30:30]  No, there's never.  All right.  Me and Steve.  When Steve doesn't have a tranquilizer dart in his butt being chased through the yards  of Jersey.  No kidding.  How many bears?  Leave the bears alone.  Bears love Jersey.  Just leave them alone.  Just looking for a quiet place to rest.  Just to rest.  I went to sleep.  It's Perv News Thursday.  All right.  So then we got the music bad.  So very good.  This porridge is perfect. 
[00:31:00]  How about we work on the one about, I don't mind you say that we're searching for other  men to have sex with, but maybe you could like wrap up the nice promo somehow at the  end.  Yeah.  Kind of tie it all up.  Like, we're not kidding.  It's Perv News Thursday.  Something.  To at least let people know that it's Perv News Thursday.  All right.  And then, of course, the reason everybody is listening to the Opie and Anthony show this  morning.  Phone call Thursday.  Phone call Thursday. 
[00:31:30]  One of the dumbest features I've ever heard in radio history.  I've been doing radio since 18 years old.  I don't get it.  And this is one of my greatest accomplishments ever.  Phone call Thursday?  Phone call Thursday.  I thought you invented the foreplay weekend.  Well, I was...  This beats the foreplay weekend?  Where the fourth cut is always live.  Of course.  Yeah.  Everyone knows that.  Right behind mandatory Metallica.  Come on. 
[00:32:00]  And get the lead out.  If you want to go old school.  But phone call Thursday.  Two for Tuesday.  Yeah.  Five o'clock traffic jam.  You know.  Five o'clock funnies.  Phone call Thursday.  Two for Tuesday.  What?  It's kind of like me dubbing today, microphone Thursday.  Where we talk into...  Ooh, can you write that down?  No, don't write it down.  But we all talk into a microphone.  I mean, it's just...  Don't we take calls every day?  Yeah, but on Thursday, we just try to take a few extra phone calls. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, will we?  It's a way of letting the listeners know that they're very important to the show.  Well, let me throw this fun fact at you.  All right.  It is just about a quarter to seven.  It means we've been on the air for about 45 minutes.  We have not taken one phone call on phone call Thursday.  Well, how about we take a phone call on phone call Thursday from a person that's saying  your fun fact is wrong.  Wow.  All right.  If you want to play, we're going to play.  All right.  Ari.  Ari from Jersey.  What's up? 
[00:33:00]  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Hey, good.  Good, good.  All right.  So the Mythbusters took a whole bunch of paper.  They laid it out about the sides of a football field, got a steamroller together, and folded  it over about 13, 15 times, something like that.  I said...  They said, you can fold it as many times as you want.  You just got to have the right equipment.  I said, you can't.  Yeah.  We're not talking steamroller.  You just take a piece of paper.  Yeah.  And try it without any tools.  Of course you can with a steamroller.  You didn't say that. 
[00:33:30]  You said you can't do it more than seven times.  You got a steamroller.  You got the right equipment or the right big guy.  He's kind of right, Ant.  Well, I've heard that before.  You're kind of right.  The folding it.  But yeah, we're talking about as a guy, dude.  You're not talking about with a steamroller.  It's Rune Fun Fact Thursday guy.  And because it's phone call Thursday, we had to take the call.  Yeah, but there's only one way to handle a guy like this.  No, that's on Wednesday, and we're dropping that feature. 
[00:34:00]  Cat Sound Wednesday.  And we're dropping that for Dog Sound Wednesday.  We're upping it a bit.  Jim in New Hampshire, what's up?  Hey, just wanted to welcome you gentlemen to a lovely phone call Thursday.  See, they love it.  But he would be calling anyway.  See, this is why I don't get phone call Thursday.  People will call anyway.  Jim, give me my prop.  We're taking their calls.  You know it's brilliant.  If you really think about it, it's brilliant.  Go ahead, Jim.  Yeah. 
[00:34:30]  Just for you and the FM listeners, I'd like to welcome everyone to the inaugural edition of Dog Bark Thursday.  No!  Holy jeez, we're losing control of the show.  No, we're not.  Because of Days of the Week.  So it's Perv News Thursday, Fun Fact Thursday, Phone Call Thursday, and Male Camel Toe Thursday.  Yeah.  No, Jimmy.  And?  No.  No.  No.  Keep your angry cat sound to yourself.  Those are the happy ones.  All right, do a happy one. 
[00:35:00]  No.  That's the capping heavy.  That wasn't believable.  All right, listen.  That's a kitten sound.  No, that's a kitten who belongs to an old person who has had a heart attack and has not fed the kitten.  And it's starting to nibble on its cheek.  Yeah, that's the capping hungry.  I have to interrupt you guys.  It is Phone Call Thursday.  Yeah.  Melissa in Jersey.  Yes.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Good.  Good.  You're on a major delay here.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, I just wanted to call to say hi on your phone call Thursday. 
[00:35:30]  No.  Why are people calling for this?  Why are people calling just to say it's Phone Call Thursday?  It's brilliant in its simplicity.  No, it's stupid because they're calling because it's Phone Call Thursday.  They're not adding anything to the show.  They're just acknowledging that it's Phone Call Thursday.  That's the beauty of Phone Call Thursday.  They could get away with murder.  All they have to do is call up and say, hey, just want to say hi on Phone Call Thursday. 
[00:36:00]  Wow.  I sure am missing something.  And we get a lot of different voices on the show.  Trust me.  It's brilliant.  Let's just go with it.  And now we got John in West Virginia.  I know it's Phone Call Thursday, but he wants to do a cat noise.  That's Wednesday.  Cat's on Wednesday.  No, no, no.  No, but it's also – it's cat noise Thursday.  No.  No, Jimmy.  No.  You can't double day.  People don't do that in radio.  Well, today's happy cat sound Thursday.  Will you stop? 
[00:36:30]  Cat noise Wednesday.  Happy cat sound Thursday.  Enough about the cat.  No, really.  Cats with emotional issues Friday.  Hey, and it's also F you to the papers Thursday.  Yes.  It's not going to be a regular feature.  Very angry.  But let's just say F you to the papers.  A show a lot of us are into.  We won't ruin it.  Rescue me.  Just in case you don't get the paper.  How about we help other people out?  Because, you know, we get the papers at 4.30 in the morning, 5 in the morning.  There are people listening.  Maybe they haven't opened up their local paper yet. 
[00:37:00]  Don't.  There's a huge, huge spoiler.  Big spoiler.  That happened on Rescue Me.  And, you know, there's a lot of us that all we do is DVR our shows at this point.  Yep.  And we haven't seen the show yet.  And then we open up the paper and it's right there.  They couldn't have made it any bigger.  Yep.  Told exactly what happened.  The huge storyline.  They almost gave up on what page you're on just to make the spoiler that much bigger.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  Bastards.  So, if you got Rescue Me DVR'd, you might want to try to avoid humans today.  Yep.  Just watch it immediately.  Stop ruining it for us DVR people.  Yep.  Who watches TV in real time?  No one.  Adam Buckman.  He ruined it in the post.  He ruined the Sopranos.  Poor people.  Huh?  His name got shot.  He ruined the...  Remember when Bobby Bacala got shot in the Sopranos?  Yeah.  He ruined that the next day.  I mean, it is the next day, but still.  You know what?  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  These were the nerds we grew up around.  They can't wait to spoil stuff.  They just wreck it.  They can't wait to get in front of their typewriter, because, you know, they're too cool for, like,  a laptop, so they're still old school.  Oh, this is what happened on Rescue Me.  Oh, I can't wait to be important today.  To ruin it.  Copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste.  On a typewriter?  Oh.  Copy, paste.  Oh.  Blank CC. 
[00:38:30]  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Yeah, that's real brave when you're blind seeing everybody.  Yeah, that was really annoying.  I love when you get a really important email from someone in the company, and you're like,  oh, wow, some inside info for just me.  Yeah, there I am.  Then you fast forward a few weeks, and you see this person wasn't brave enough at the  time, but he blind seeded the whole company.  Blank CC.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  Blind CC.  So, who wrecked it today? 
[00:39:00]  That was the first thing I saw, man.  Both papers.  Both papers.  Both did it?  Huh?  I didn't know both.  Both did it, and then I'm sure every paper around the country did it.  And, of course, they have to say, no one saw this coming.  I'm like, oh, great.  Yeah, great.  So, it's not even one of these episodes where you do see what's going on, and you're just  waiting for it to happen.  Supposedly, no one saw this coming.  I'm like, oh, thank you.  Thank you very much.  Just watch it.  Ass head.  And pretend that you don't know it's coming.  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  That works. 
[00:39:30]  And, you know, I'm box-setting my ass off, and I'm not even going to tell you what shows  I'm watching, because I don't want anyone to ruin it for me.  That's what I do.  I'm box-setting a couple different shows right now.  I'm watching The Sopranos, so keep what finally happens under your hats.  Yeah.  Shh.  I'm on season one.  Does the mother make it all the way through?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, someone is saying we can't do F.U. paper today, because it's F.U. Friday. 
[00:40:00]  Hey, yeah.  Why?  Oh, my God.  Travis!  Wow.  Bring back F.U. Friday.  We forgot about that.  Thank you, Greg, on Long Island.  That's one of our real features, actually.  Well, here we got Brooklyn Ace.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  I wasn't going to call today, but seeing as how it's phone call Thursday, I figured I may  as well call.  But just for that, like, you have nothing, right?  Absolutely.  It's just phone call Thursday.  So he's calling...  It's a way to get to know the listeners, Ant, and give them a voice. 
[00:40:30]  But they're not adding anything.  It's okay, because it's phone call Thursday.  That's the beauty of this.  We don't even have to try.  We don't even have to ask Brooklyn Ace any questions and try to actually get radio out  of them.  I hate phone call Thursday.  It's brilliant.  All he has to do is call up and say, hey, I just want to say hi.  It's phone call Thursday.  We don't have to try as hard.  Hey, Ant, I will make you feel a little better.  I do have something to tell you guys.  I have about five or six people on my team that Opie gave me that job for last week. 
[00:41:00]  Remembering when the last time you talked about someone.  Well, that's his job.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That is your job.  But I don't want to say what it is, because then you're going to have to update the thing.  That's exactly why I'm not saying it.  All right.  Very good.  Very good.  You're smart.  That's why we gave him the job.  He's very smart.  Tom in Michigan, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing today, guys?  Good.  Good.  You have a phone call Thursday call?  Indeed.  Indeed.  And I would like to thank you for phone call Thursday, because without it, a boring waste 
[00:41:30]  of life like me would never make it on the air.  See, and Travis doesn't even have to screen the calls.  He just lets everyone through.  All you need is a phone.  All you need is a phone.  So Travis gets the day off.  It's brilliant, Andy.  Do you realize this brings no substance to the show?  It's like running water Thursday.  Hey, man.  Out of all the features.  Nothing happened.  No, don't take running water Thursday, where we just leave the water running in the bathroom. 
[00:42:00]  Out of all, we could do that and have everyone do that all over the city.  It could be very interesting.  It's very bad for water conservation and it's heat.  Well, all right.  You're right about that.  But out of all the features we have created in the last few weeks, this is the one that's  taken off.  So, everyone is fighting for the one they invented.  I'm thinking phone call Thursday is going to be the hit.  Sorry to Jimmy and Cat Noise Wednesday.  I think that you're wrong.  I think that the cat noise Monday through Friday.  It's not Monday through Friday. 
[00:42:30]  I think people are really going to grab onto it.  Here's what annoys the living crap out of me.  What?  We have sat here and discussed the war in Iraq.  Yeah.  We have discussed politics.  Sure.  We have discussed world issues that are so important to us as individuals and this country  and crickets on the phone.  I am looking at every phone line lit up.  Every phone line is lit up for people to call because it's phone call Thursday. 
[00:43:00]  Stephen from Pennsylvania.  Yes.  Hi, guys.  I listen to your show all the time and it's great, but I've never called before.  So, and today's phone call Thursday and I want to take advantage of it.  And I want to tell you that it is a fact that it's fun to call Opie and Anthony on phone  call Thursday.  Ooh.  There you go.  Combination.  There you go, see?  That wasn't a combination.  We're getting great radio.  You stop and just go with it. 
[00:43:30]  Sam in Massachusetts.  Yes.  How can I go with this?  Morning, boys.  Hey.  I just wanted to wish you a happy phone call Thursday.  Jesus Christ.  Could someone call with something pertinent?  Ray in New York.  All over the country it's happening.  Yes, Ray.  Yeah, hello.  Hey.  Phone call Thursday.  And every time a caller calls in and then hangs up, their spot is immediately taken by  another call.  We have discussed the issues that really have deep meaning on this show.  We could turn it into first time caller Thursday, if that helps. 
[00:44:00]  No.  That'll thin the hurt eventually.  It doesn't help.  Richie and Westchester.  They'll just lie.  What, are you going to tell the truth?  Have you ever called before?  No.  No.  And it's like Steve from Bayshore or somebody that's like just a phone whore.  Dug out Dan from Virginia.  Right.  Richie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I love the show.  Yeah.  First time caller.  Yeah.  And thank you for having a phone call today.  See?  Thank you.  Hey, it's true that they're listening at least. 
[00:44:30]  But don't they realize they could have called any day?  Any day we take phone calls.  But on Thursdays we take a few extra.  Just a few extra.  That's it.  Look.  I'm dumbfounded.  Look.  Jeff in Jersey.  Hey, guys.  I got wild on a Thursday.  Wait a minute.  You can't, though.  Well, actually.  Whip them out whenever.  Yeah.  We turn that into whip them out whenever.  Finally.  Yeah.  A call that actually has something to do with a promotion that we've been doing for years 
[00:45:00]  that actually is good.  And we expanded that to whip them out whenever.  That's the only feature on the Opie and Anthony show that's all week long.  Thank you, Jeff.  Jimmy.  For calling with something important.  What?  All right.  Okay.  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Must have been a problem with the phone.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break.  On the way, we'll.  Oh, you don't want to take more calls?  I'm looking.  They're all full.  Wants to do a cat noise.  You can't do that, Steve.  In Boston.  You just can't. 
[00:45:30]  Somebody's calling from the future.  Wants to know how was phone call Thursday.  Wait.  Steve wanted to go to do a cat noise?  Yeah.  You can't say that.  Because you never get through.  You don't understand.  That's right.  There's a battle here.  That's right.  There's a battle going on.  Phone call Thursday is a mauling cat noise every day.  Every day.  We got Boston, North Carolina, Delaware, Syracuse, Buffalo, Philly, all want in on phone call Thursday.  I'm going to do my best to abolish this feature for Thursday. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah, then I'll take one of your features out.  I don't have a feature.  I'll just think of a stupid feature for a day.  Let me give it a little thought.  I'll think of a stupid feature like phone call Thursday.  But you can't add it to Thursday because we're filled up.  Oh, apparently.  We're filled up with features and phone calls, so.  All right.  And your fun fact was wrong.  So come up with another fun fact.  I've heard that, too, though.  Or fun fact Thursday is going to go by the wayside. 
[00:46:30]  We're going to lose fun fact Thursday to the morning zoo.  I think he was right.  I think I was, too.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, and we'll give you your Chris Benoit update next.  And Paris on Larry King was just terrific.  Hot.  Just terrific.  Ah, too bad it's not Air Guitar Friday, man.  Ah, why did you play this today?  Tomorrow.  This is a good air guitar song.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  877-212. 
[00:47:00]  That makes sense.  5, 7, 6, 2.  Let's go to Amy in New Hampshire.  Amy, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How are you?  How are you, Amy?  Um, happy fun call Thursday, but something pertinent.  Thanks, hon.  I did make Hummer Tuesday happen for my husband.  Ah, okay.  Now you're talking.  Yeah, we brought back Hummer Tuesday this week, so there you go.  Just because of our show, you took care of your husband?  You gave him a Hummer?  I did.  All because of you guys, actually.  In the name of the Opie and Anthony Show, guys are getting Hummers now. 
[00:47:30]  That's beautiful.  Well, thank you, Amy.  I figured I'd call, let you guys know.  You guys have a great day.  Love this evening.  Thank you.  You too.  See, Anthony, now do you understand what's going on?  She would have never called today, but it is phone call Thursday, and she called to tell  us that she participated in Hummer Tuesday.  And you're saying that phone call Thursday made her call.  She would never have called to give us that news.  Yes.  See, but she can.  But she didn't.  But this is a way of getting the listeners more involved with the show. 
[00:48:00]  Charlie and Philly listening on WISP.  We're coming to Philly, by the way.  Make sure you keep listening to WISP for all the details.  What's up, Charlie?  Opie, Anthony, and little Jimmy.  What's up, boys?  Good evening.  Hey, Charlie.  Hey, I just wanted to say phone call Thursday is great because a lot of times on the other  days of the week, a lot of us don't have nothing for the show.  But this just lets us have a little bit of a voice.  No, see, you still have nothing for the show.  Why doesn't anyone see my point?  No, see. 
[00:48:30]  You have nothing for the show.  Yeah, but.  Just calling it phone call Thursday and having people call doesn't contribute anything.  On any other day, that would make perfect sense.  But it's phone call Thursday, so he does have something.  The phones are lit, why?  Just the fact that he's on the show means he has something on phone call Thursday.  Oh, my God.  Even Maine is getting involved with phone call Thursday.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, first of all, I wanted to wish you a happy phone call Thursday. 
[00:49:00]  And how are people now wishing happy phone call Thursday?  Because it's just the right thing to do, Anthony.  That's how you have to address it?  Yes.  I had a question for you.  Yeah.  Since you're bringing Tuesday back, could I do a rock stream?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Now the days are all over the place.  If we allow that, then everyone's going to get confused.  It's day anarchy when people start doing that.  Everyone knows that.  Jimmy's bad enough with Cat Sound Wednesday, trying to carry it over onto every other day. 
[00:49:30]  It's Cat Sound every day.  No.  This damn phone call Thursday is taking off.  Look at the phones.  Look at the phones.  Look at the phones.  Do you understand people are calling just because?  The only thing that's bothering me about phone call Thursday is that they're forgetting about  everything else that's going on today.  Fun fact Thursday.  Oh, fun fact Thursday.  Male camel toe Thursday.  Look, I even have to look at the list.  And perv news Thursday.  Perv news.  Now, that's something I can get into.  Perv news Thursday.  We're going to do that in about a half hour.  All your perv news. 
[00:50:00]  And what?  In the meantime, it's phone call Thursday?  How about this?  Sam from FBA.  A fun fact from Instant Feedback.  All righty.  Over 10,000 birds a year die from smashing into windows.  I bet Jim likes this one.  I happen to like birds.  You do?  No.  Is this a true fun fact?  Ah.  That, um...  Fun fact Thursday is ruining the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes.  That Worcestershire sauce is basically anchovy ketchup?  No. 
[00:50:30]  That's actually a myth that people say who don't like Worcestershire sauce.  The A1 people snuck that out.  Now there's a big court battle.  All right.  All right.  Listen, Chris Benoit, here's your latest.  Here's the bullet points or the headlines on Chris Benoit.  Does this go under fun facts or...  Wow.  This is just twisted.  Twisted news Thursday.  Cops think Benoit may have used a chokehold to kill his retarded son.  Oh. 
[00:51:00]  I don't think his son was retarded.  I think his son was a little slow.  Now he had like an autism thing.  Yeah, an autism thing.  Yeah.  He had some kind of a growth problem.  Fragile.  What's it called?  Fragile X or something?  Yes.  Fragile X.  I've never heard of Fragile X, but supposedly you kind of look...  He's a new supervillain.  You kind of look like a normal kid, but then when you hit puberty, it's when it kicks in.  Yeah.  And you...  I don't know if you...  They keep saying retarded in the paper and that it would, I guess, would have gotten worse.  But it's a weird moment I'm watching as they continue...  And again, this is part of the autism maybe. 
[00:51:30]  They keep showing the father hugging him in the ring after he won.  And if you watch it, the kid's arms are out in...  Not...  Almost like, you know, you put your hands up.  This is a stick up.  Yeah.  His hands are out like that.  He's not hugging his dad back, which could have just been he was nervous.  That to me seemed like an autistic thing, though.  Yeah.  Like not hugging him back, which I could just...  Yeah, because you're Dr. Jim.  Yes.  And Benoit...  Dr. Jim Thursday.  Benoit and his wife were fighting in recent months because she wanted him to be home more, 
[00:52:00]  to spend a little more time with the kid.  Help raise the kid because obviously the kid has some problems and she needed help.  And she really wanted him to, you know, to get off the road a little bit and start spending  more time at home to help her because it was, I guess, a real, real problem.  But he didn't tell his friends even about that.  No.  A lot of people didn't know.  And I'm wondering, was he, like, ashamed of his son?  Which goes to show you, I think, yeah.  What was he trying just to protect him?  I think that I...  This guy doesn't seem like the type of guy, based on his recent actions, of somebody that 
[00:52:30]  might...  My personal opinion, I think he was ashamed of his kid.  Be like that, yeah.  I think he was a little ashamed.  And Vince lost $20 million yesterday as shareholders sell their WWE stock like crazy.  Four times the amount of activity on that stock yesterday.  And, you know, they said...  It's a good buy opportunity.  They're saying that he lost about $20 million yesterday.  There's rumors that there's going to be another, like, steroid controversy.  Big scandal.  Scandal with his company. 
[00:53:00]  Mmm.  And obviously being family entertainment and having this just horrific family tragedy happen  doesn't help your company.  Well, it was bad enough they had that big steroid thing happen in WWF, when it was WWF.  And that was pretty controversial.  A lot of the wrestlers were saying that a lot of them did steroids.  And a lot of the deaths that happened at a young age for these guys were steroid-related.  But, like you brought up, this is something a little different. 
[00:53:30]  And this is some guy killing his family and himself.  Well, I'm saying in the office, when you get one of these wrestlers dying in some, like, hotel in the middle of nowhere,  it's obviously a tragedy.  It's sad and all that.  But this is so much different, man.  Yeah.  He spent the whole weekend, like, you know, killing his wife, his son.  And then did you hear how he killed himself?  Oh.  Where he wrapped a cord around his neck from one of his weight machines.  I'm thinking it's the pull-down, by the way.  Pull-down.  We're trying to figure it out.  And then he released 240 pounds to hang himself. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Just let go.  He let go on 240 pounds.  Clang.  Yeah, the weight goes clang and your neck goes snap.  Goodbye.  There's a lot of muscle on that neck.  240 pounds was released using one of his weight machines that he had in his home.  Might have put his son in, like, a choke hold, a sleeper hold.  I'm guessing he put, like, a sleeper hold first.  Yeah, because there's no marks on his son's neck like he was strangled.  So they're thinking, yeah.  That was a weird. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, the choke hold.  I guarantee you he killed his son just because he freaked out and killed his wife  and realized, what's going to happen to this kid now?  I'm going to jail.  He's got issues.  Yeah.  This kid's finished.  Yeah.  And then the WWE recently, like, kind of gave him a demotion.  Yep.  Wanted him to be more of a coaching type wrestler.  Yeah.  Where they don't do as much action.  They get in the ring.  Huh?  Although Sam doesn't agree with that.  You don't agree with that, Sam?  Yeah, I don't know if that's true because they just moved him over to their ECW branch 
[00:55:00]  and they were going to put the belt on him, I would assume, because the guy who subbed  in for him, he had an ECW title match at the pay-per-view he didn't show up for, and  the guy who subbed in for him, they put the belt on him instead.  So I would assume they were going to put the belt on Benoit, at least for a little while.  No, man, that's maybe, but behind the scenes, I mean, the real stuff they're saying is maybe  they really did demote him and tell him, look, you got six months.  I mean, maybe it was that.  Could have been.  But they seem to have demoted him, which would have made him freak out, I'm sure, even more. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  I mean, to hear that you're not going to be, I mean, he was 40 years old.  It doesn't seem crazy that they were going to knock him down a little bit.  There's a lot of 40-year-olds doing the wrestling thing.  Yeah.  I mean, The Undertaker, how old is he, man?  He's right up there.  He's like, he's got to be 40.  Oh, he's way past 40 or something.  Has to be.  That guy years ago.  And then stick to hearing about the steroids.  I don't care if people do steroids.  Why are we so, who cares?  Well, I think because perhaps if it drives you to kill your family.  Then stop with alcohol.  People, no one's taking steroids and barreling into children. 
[00:56:00]  I don't care if athletes take steroids and hit a ball farther or they throw each other.  I could care less.  Yeah, I don't care either because I don't know these people.  I don't know these people personally, so I don't care.  I want to see 600-foot homers.  I've changed my tune on the whole steroid thing in baseball.  Yeah, I want to see 600-foot homers.  I want to see homers leave the ballpark like Mickey Mantle did back in the day.  That famous homer they always show you where you hit on the top of Yankee Stadium or whatever.  What? 
[00:56:30]  I want to see homers like that.  What if they find out, though, that it makes people kind of nutty?  I don't care.  Then, you know what?  It's a Bill Hicks bit, but then get rid of rock and roll.  The greatest tunes were recorded and written on some horrific drugs.  No, but horrific drugs.  There's a song called, Get Out of My Way, Bitch!  Get Out of My Way, Bitch!  There are some drugs that are...  Great music because of heroin, great music because of cocaine, great music because of crystal meth, great music because of alcohol. 
[00:57:00]  Heroin doesn't make people kill other people unless they don't have money to buy the heroin.  Then they'll kill people.  Pot.  You smoke some pot.  You're really not going to get all that violent.  But if you're doing crystal meth, you're going to get a little violent.  There are different drugs that do different things.  I think steroids might be...  Crystal meth gives you some nice, you know...  Crystal meth makes you insane.  Yeah, but you get some great music out of it. 
[00:57:30]  ...and makes you want to hurt people.  Maybe steroids is like that where it kind of, you know, gets into that part of your brain that makes you a little violent.  Royd rage.  They got a word for it.  Royd rage.  Why should we care if we don't know them personally?  I don't care.  I don't care.  The wife and kid, it's a little tragic.  Dude, I mean, there's, you know, music that was made on LSD and...  LSD.  And heroin.  Makes you hurl yourself out a window.  Kurt Cobain was a...  He was just a horrific heroin addict and we got some great music out of him.  Yeah.  And then you kill yourself.  If he was happy and he was sober, what kind of music do you think he would have made? 
[00:58:00]  Benoit killed himself.  I don't think anybody would care as much as if, you know, he killed his wife and...  How often does this happen, though, with steroids?  Look at booze does, man.  This literally...  Yeah.  People murder their wives every day.  In this country, there's at least one murder a day because of alcohol.  You won't let them have a drink.  Well, you know what I'm saying?  It's like...  Fix me a drink.  I don't care about the steroids.  I don't care what it does to them.  If they know what it does and they want to take it, let them. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  I could care less.  It's not my business.  Yeah.  We're kind of hypocritical.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  We kind of bury the alcohol thing.  The alcohol's the worst of them all.  You know...  The worst.  I don't hear a lot of steroid-related deaths.  Well, not a lot.  Not a lot of people, as compared to people drinking, are doing steroids.  Well, we kind of, like, allow that to happen for whatever reason.  Yeah, it's been around for years.  We even tried getting rid of alcohol.  Look what happened.  They made something called the mafia. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah.  But you know what I'm saying?  We love the mafia.  The violence associated with it is, like, accepted.  The drunk driving deaths.  They're trying to have all these laws about this.  And it happens every day with alcohol.  Do you understand why?  Because drinking is fun.  So it's steroids.  It's fun for most people.  How great would it be to be muscular and just beat everybody up?  I would love that.  That would be fantastic.  But doing steroids is fun for some people.  Is it fun or is it just...  Doing heroin is fun for some people.  Doing crystal meth is fun for some people.  The cokeheads out there, they would tell you that's fun. 
[00:59:30]  Fun for everybody.  But...  I have changed my time.  I don't care what the performers do.  Yeah.  Nah.  If someone in my family is doing it, then it's a different story.  Then I care.  Yeah.  Because I'm close to the situation.  You're just localizing yourself.  Yeah.  You're not...  You know, it takes a village over here.  We must care about our neighbors.  Speaking of...  I love when I take the side I really don't give a crap about.  Yeah.  Hey, but what if the violence in... 
[01:00:00]  I'd like to make this announcement.  I could care less.  Stone Cold's wife says drug abuse and domestic violence are big in the WWE.  What?  Looks like Stone Cold's not going to get a lot of work with Vince.  These big monsters that are perhaps doing steroids are treating their wives improperly?  How?  Oh, hi, hi.  But Sam's going to, like, defend that.  Uh, Sam?  What's going on, Sam?  Well, I don't know.  The WWE just put out a press release that they don't like the sensationalistic coverage of the Chris Benoit thing and everybody saying roid rage. 
[01:00:30]  The sensationalism, it's just facts.  This guy went on a murder spree.  Yeah, I don't think this has been that...  Like, this is the same coverage I misgot, which was disgusting, but this is a guy who killed his wife and son and we're learning things about it.  I don't think it's that sensationalistic, actually.  Sensational.  They were just saying that in a press conference, the authorities stated that all drugs found in the house were believed to be legal prescriptions. 
[01:01:00]  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm.  I read an article that they said they found steroids.  They said legal steroids.  I'm running the paper today, and I believe everything I read in the paper.  They did say prescribed steroids.  Maybe they said prescribed.  I'm just reading of a press release.  Okay.  Steroids were not and could not be related to the cause of death, asphyxiation.  Authorities had no factual basis to speculate as to Benoit's state of mind and rightly did not do so. 
[01:01:30]  Toxicology tests...  What did you have for dinner last night?  I had fish sticks and some leftover chicken fingers and microwave French fries.  He never, never disappoints.  Sam.  Do you ever go to the bathroom or is your whole system clogged?  I go to the bathroom sometimes.  Sometimes.  Wait until your metabolism slows down.  You're going to be a fat boy.  He's a skinny guy.  You've still got youth on your side, man.  He's a skinny young guy.  He can eat what he wants.  Just in case.  He just wants to eat like an eight-year-old. 
[01:02:00]  To bring more people on board, yes.  We've discovered that Sam's diet is one of an eight-year-old.  You are part of this giant chicken holocaust.  That's all you eat.  You're like the Adolf Hitler for chickens.  What was dessert?  I had a good humor ice cream bar.  One of those chocolate with the vanilla ice cream, you know?  Do you eat the chocolate off of it first?  Not, I mean, maybe bite by bite.  You like them soft or hard? 
[01:02:30]  Wow.  You slap the good Hewlett bar on your face before you enjoy it?  Pretend you're cuffed?  Nothing beats soft ice cream like from Carvel or the Mr. Softy Truck or something like that.  That's good stuff.  Hard ice cream is good if it's good.  Dove bars are great, but I know that's probably a little too adult for you.  I like the little ones.  You like the little ones, of course.  But nothing beats a very good quality ice cream sandwich.  Oh, I love them.  Oh, who doesn't love those? 
[01:03:00]  Do you like scraping your tongue on your, like scraping your teeth on your thumb to get the ice cream sandwich off in the last bite?  You know, the ice cream sandwich, no matter how you eat it.  It'll stick to your thumb.  There's always on your thumb and your finger.  Like you could be fingerprinted with ice cream sandwich.  You got a scrape on your tongue.  Sandwich.  I had a, what are they called last night?  I was telling you.  Oh.  Ugh.  Jimmy.  Is that a new Ben and Jerry's flavor?  He could not possibly have had that. 
[01:03:30]  The, um.  What are they called?  I don't know, but they're not, there's no dairy in them and they're ice cream sandwiches and they're good.  They're called cuties or something like that?  Horrible.  I heard you guys talking about this in the office and I was retching.  I went to the supermarket last night and I ran into someone that I know and, uh, and they too were buying ice cream.  We went in for ice cream and they're like, oh, you got to try these cutie bars or something like that.  Cutie bar?  And there's, there's no dairy.  Fruit.  No sugar, I don't think.  I don't know.  Or fake sugar.  No flavor.  No, dude.  No enjoyment.  They're really good.  Now they eat the stick. 
[01:04:00]  It's made from, it's made from tofu, but it tastes like ice cream.  Oh, tofu, ice cream, shut up.  It can't be good.  Look, I said, what the hell?  Tofu, everything sucks.  Look, look, I still eat ice cream.  I'm not a freak with my diet, but they said, you got to try these things.  So we said, what the hell?  We'll try them.  I got cutie.  I got the mint chocolate chip.  It's a little cutie, uh, ice cream sandwich or it's called something.  I don't know if it's called cutie or tootie or tofutie.  Toe cutie.  I don't know.  And man, I ate one, just one little, uh, sandwich bar. 
[01:04:30]  And, uh, within seconds, I know we have to take a break.  Like, within seconds, the worst gas.  Oh, see.  Ever.  Blew up on you.  The kind of gas that I was embarrassed to be alive.  I was embarrassed.  Can we have some?  And then my, my girl just yelling at me, just yelling at me.  Just, just an embarrassment.  She had to point out how awful it was, which made me look sadder. 
[01:05:00]  I never get into this, but I had quite an episode yesterday myself.  Wow, this is very unorthodox.  I very rarely talk about, uh, bodily movements.  The, uh, filth that is, uh, that, uh, is disposed of.  Oh, by the way.  From your human body.  You're done, Sam.  We don't care about the, uh, rest of the crap.  Go ahead there.  I rarely talk about it, but it was such a spectacular, uh, thing.  Um, well, yesterday I had, uh, uh, Mexican food.  Nice.  Got four tacos, chicken tacos, some, uh, refried beans and rice and, and a chili. 
[01:05:30]  But I left the chili in the fridge to have it yesterday.  Sure.  So it was like the day before yesterday I had Mexican.  So I got home and, uh, I'm going to be going to the gym soon.  And so I just, I just eat this chili and I had had a smoothie yesterday also.  So I go to the gym for disaster.  I go to the gym and start working out and my stomach felt like I got a knife put right 
[01:06:00]  in my lower abdomen.  I was like, I'm on the Stairmaster just clenching.  It sounded like a haunted house door.  Just clenching.  I make it through the workout, get in the car, drive home.  And you know how your body knows there are certain muscles that, uh, are supposed to  be watertight, like a watertight door on a ship that is just supposed to hold back everything.  It started, uh, twitching when I started getting home. 
[01:06:30]  And I mean, I was flying home.  Did you have to stiff leg in the garage?  I stiff legged.  I got that tingling in my legs, ran up the stairs because I knew this was going to be an  industrial strength one that I needed like the master bathroom for where all the tools  of the trade are all the, the, the baby wipes and, and, and the extra soft toilet paper,  not the stuff we reserve for the help or the guests.  But I knew like I would need all the distractions, reading materials, everything had to be around 
[01:07:00]  me.  TV sets.  Weren't you looking forward to it though?  When you're walking in for one like that, aren't you looking forward to it?  This is going to be, I was, if it didn't hurt so much.  The second I got to the top of the stairs, I would doubled over with what again, felt  like somebody took a, a shank and just stuck it in my lower abdomen.  But once I got ready for action, oh my God, just like, I can't even describe it. 
[01:07:30]  Probably like we were talking about Carvel.  Yeah.  Or yeah, at first.  And then just making sounds like, you know, you know, the famous, uh, puke scene in team  America where, uh, the puppet walks out back and starts throwing up, you know, that part  where obviously the, the engineers that were running the puppet ran out of the puppet puke  and it just started going, that is a good, uh, kind of comparison. 
[01:08:00]  It was kind of like, it was kind of like 4th of July in your, in your bowl.  I haven't had 4th of July in the bowl yet.  Oh, please.  Or it sounded like little firecrackers going off.  Little firecrackers.  And then there's just something where you're just thinking, you know, something that there  is absolutely nothing solid going on here whatsoever, whatsoever. 
[01:08:30]  Uh, someone is suggesting that, uh, it should be green apple splatters Thursday.  Thank you.  Take the win.  No, no, no, nothing green about it.  No, nothing green.  By the way, uh, might as well throw myself under the bus, but Jimmy does eat these things  as well.  Sean from PA.  I challenge people, was it Sean?  Yeah.  I challenge people to come up with a, uh, a faggier name for a food.  The things I ate last night and Jimmy has eaten them as well. 
[01:09:00]  They're called Tofutie, Tofutie Cuties.  Oh yeah, these are cuties.  Dude, let me tell you something.  Come up with a foodie, a faggier name for a food than Tofutie Cuties.  I want to send somebody to a store, a supermarket at this hour.  Hey, and why don't you try a Tofutie?  We'll all have one.  No.  Yes, they're delicious.  I'll take one bite off of a Tofutie Cutie.  Kenny, can somebody grab these? 
[01:09:30]  I prefer regular, not mint chocolate chip.  I want, hold on Kenny.  We got to travel today.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're going to actually eat a Tofutie Cutie and then travel?  To the Mohegan Sun?  We'll have one.  You might, uh, one.  The radio show is more important.  How do you do it for this show?  Look at the little box with the little ice cream sandwich on it, a Tofutie Cutie.  Yeah, can you send somebody for this?  I will get them right now.  Thank you.  I want to see Casual Kenny eat a Tofutie Cutie.  Oh, no, I'm not.  You're not going to eat the Tofutie?  You can't even say the damn thing. 
[01:10:00]  I got a dessert that's almost as fruity.  What?  Yeah?  Um, how about Freddie Mercury's ****?  That is, that almost comes close to Tofutie Cutie.  Oh.  Tofutie Cutie.  This is not a faggier name for a food.  If you ate it out of Rock Hudson's ****, it wouldn't be as fruity.  Tofutie.  People are suggesting that I might have had a Bikini Teenie as I was eating a Tofutie Cutie. 
[01:10:30]  That's not nice.  Wait, if you eat a Tofutie Cutie, look down at your ****, it's covered with doody.  That can't work.  That works perfectly.  You think that works?  Of course.  If it did, you're brilliant.  Of course it worked.  If that got through, you're brilliant, Jimmy.  Absolutely.  All right, very good.  All right, so we're going to get some Tofutie Cuties.  Try those out today on the show.  And now, you know, people want to call with faggier names for food, 
[01:11:00]  but it's phone call Thursday, so we have a problem.  We have a log jam here.  Let's go.  Have a Tofutie Cutie, and then what my **** is shootie.  Or, hey, wait, I'm enjoying that.  Wait, I love a good Tofutie Cutie.  Hey, put that **** right in my booty.  Tom in Dallas.  What's up, Tom?  How's it going, guys?  By the way, F Dallas.  F Dallas right in there. 
[01:11:30]  Wow.  F you know what.  Yeah, I know.  They dropped the show, and they put on a morning zoo,  and they had a horrific trend.  Go F yourselves, Dallas.  Yeah, I know.  But, hey, I was at the store the other day,  and I did see a really faggy breakfast cereal.  Yeah.  Yogurt Burst Cheerios.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Not as fruity as the one Opie was caught eating.  Tofutie Cutie?  Tofutie Cutie.  No, what was that stuff called? 
[01:12:00]  What?  That cereal you ate that day, you were just catching hell for it.  I don't know what you're talking about.  It's something friends.  Hey.  Something friends.  What's your, what?  And it had the woman, no, it had the woman on the box.  It was a woman's cereal.  It was a cereal.  Listen.  Like, it had extra iron in it for when you have your period.  Listen, listen, no one's going to remember, so don't even try.  And he's like, don't try helping him.  Shut up.  It was called Lean on Me.  Shut up. 
[01:12:30]  It was also Just Friends.  Just Friends.  What the hell's wrong with you guys?  And that was the one with the multiracial couples on the cover,  because they're very diverse.  Yeah, of course.  Cereal.  Of course.  That was great.  Yeah.  Well, they couldn't call it **** Loops.  All right, listen.  We're running late here.  Now we got more stuff to do on our show.  Yes.  Very busy.  It's Tofutie Cutie Thursday.  Yes, it is Tofutie Cutie.  When people are, there's a picture of you posing with the Lean on Me box, 
[01:13:00]  and now people think that you eat it.  There you go.  I was.  There you go.  It's up on our website.  That was a takeoff on me imitating the Oafster.  Yeah, okay.  Because I wanted people to see the box, and it's a woman weighing herself.  F38 of all this crap.  F38.  Some Lean on Me.  Speaking of Tofutie Cuties.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Steve's arms.  I like to rub them on my shaved arm.  Yes.  It's wonderful.  My friends are having a Tofutie Cutie party. 
[01:13:30]  When people, you know, chatter about the show behind the scenes,  they're like, yeah, these guys don't have a lot going on on the show.  Now we have too much.  Yes.  Now today we're going to be eating Tofutie Cutie.  I'm either going to have one or 19.  I'm not sure.  I'll get back to you on that.  We got a phone call Thursday in effect, which is wrecking everything.  Phone call Thursday stinks.  Now people with real stuff can't get through.  No.  They can't.  Cat sound.  That's Wednesday. 
[01:14:00]  Fun fact Thursday.  And that's on the fence.  Male camel toe Thursday.  And on the way, Perv News for Perv News Thursday.  That I want to hear.  But first, a little break.  And we got to do the Larry King Paris stuff.  Yes.  She was just terrific on TV last night.  Her b**** smells like garlic.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show. 
[01:14:30]  It's O.P. and Anthony.  Casual Kenny has come back.  Casual Kenny.  Well, today's Casual Kenny, because we're hitting the road right after the show to get  up to Mohegan Sun for the big live broadcast tomorrow from the Wolf Den.  And the comedy show, of course, on Saturday that a lot of people are looking forward to. 
[01:15:00]  What's up, Kenny?  Casual Kenny Thursday.  Stupid Kenny Daly.  Very good.  Well, he's brought a couple of boxes of Tofutie Cuties.  Thank you, Kenny.  This is something I guess Jimmy was familiar with.  And O.P. saw some people he knew last night buying.  Yeah.  And you tried one.  Well, we all we ran into some people at the the old ice cream freezer there and they said, 
[01:15:30]  oh, you got to try these Tofutie Cuties.  Milk free.  No butter fat.  Lactose free.  Dairy free.  Frozen dessert.  Nice.  So I know Tom is panicking right now.  Like this is some kind of plug.  All a no.  It's just something I decided to eat last night.  I hope you don't mind.  No.  I want them like idiots.  I'm sure he's calling the company right now trying to get money from them.  We will need thousands of dollars from your Tofutie Cutie people.  Don't get cutie with us. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, everyone dig in and have a Tofutie Cutie.  I'm eating mine immediately because I'm hoping that I could reenact what happened to me last  night right after I ate this.  Can I have a regular ant, please?  I'm going to try a standard vanilla Tofutie Cutie.  Oh, they're a little.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy.  Thank you.  Jimmy, everybody grab one.  This should work.  They're so little.  This should mix well with egg whites and broccoli.  This is like an ice cream sandwich embryo. 
[01:16:30]  They're so tiny.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  Here we go.  It kind of smells like an ice cream sandwich.  There's no dairy, though.  It's all tofu.  What's wrong, man?  I'm just watching it.  It's good, right?  It's good, right?  It's great.  Right?  Dude, there's this aftertaste.  The initial bite isn't that bad.  Yeah. 
[01:17:00]  But then there's this aftertaste of, of, of, of, that is just horrific.  That's why you got to get the mint chocolate chip.  The mints help that.  I'm going to try one more.  Maybe it was just me.  Maybe it's just because I finished my.  Take a bite out of mint chocolate chip.  Yeah.  No, why would I want to do that?  Mm.  More coverage of.  Let me try.  Oh, my God.  My stomach's already gurgling.  Hold on.  I'm loving my Tofutie Cutie.  Oh, God.  Then game on.  Yeah.  Game on.  Not bad until.  See, right there.  It just hit me. 
[01:17:30]  What?  What is it?  It's horrible.  Mm-mm.  Ugh.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  My stomach's gurgling so bad.  That is horrible.  Why would you eat that?  I'm loving this.  Look, man.  Someone suggested I say, what the hell?  I'll give it a try.  I'm loving it.  It's not bad.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Are you already, like, bubbling?  One of these.  Take them away.  I'm percolating.  Thank you.  And old friend wants to say hi. 
[01:18:00]  Louis Black, everyone.  Ooh.  Louis.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow.  Wait.  That isn't Louis.  Meow.  What the?  Jimmy.  Meow.  Jimmy Norton called in on the hotline as Louis Black?  Just so he could get a cat noise in?  No.  What the hell, man?  What?  It says Louis Black saying hi, wants to comment on Paris Hilton. 
[01:18:30]  Meow.  Jimmy, I see you doing the cat noises.  That is.  On your cell phone.  That's cheating.  Right in front of me.  You're turning around, but I can still see you're on the cell phone.  I'm not.  Meow.  Stop it.  Tofutie cutie.  Oh, my God.  My God.  That stuff really sucks.  Yeah.  You're going to find out how much it sucks in about 15 minutes.  I don't know the aftertaste of you.  I just had two bites. 
[01:19:00]  No, at first, it tastes like a real ice cream sandwich.  Yeah.  And then it just takes this turn for the worse where it's got this weird taste.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How about we clear the air with a fun fact?  We'll be clearing the air in a few minutes.  San, you got a fun fact for us?  It is fun fact Thursday.  I sure do.  Uh-huh.  On average, 100 people choke to death on ballpoint pens every year. 
[01:19:30]  Ah, nice fun fact.  It didn't seem very fun, but it's a fun fact.  I guess there's a fact.  And it's fun.  I don't like the mint chip, to be honest.  Why?  Which one did you try, vanilla or mint chip?  Just the vanilla.  That's a weird flavor.  I prefer the others.  I don't like them at all.  All right.  Well, that's okay.  What does it taste like?  Doesn't John Ratzenberger look great?  Who thought he'd be the guy that kind of just looks kind of like himself, like he did in Cheers? 
[01:20:00]  He never aged.  Yeah.  He's a little creepy.  He's an alien, I'm thinking.  All right.  Let's, uh...  You gotta be an alien.  He's gotta be an alien.  Chess and Alzheimer's...  Wait.  Chess and crossword puzzles may fight Alzheimer's?  How helpful is it when you're eating the bishop?  Because you think it's pizza.  King me!  Chess, you idiot.  By the way, yeah.  The homeless guy in the park cracks your head open, so it knocks your Alzheimer's out for a minute.  Could you play? 
[01:20:30]  That's possible.  Yes.  Dr. Jimmy?  Yes.  What happens is you play in the park for two-minute games, and you're moving slowly, and he takes  a brick and hits you, and your brain goes blah, blah, blah, and you're okay for ten minutes.  By the way, Kevin is pointing out something on Instant Feedback from Connecticut there.  Yeah.  How excited were you, Opie?  It's Louis Black, everyone!  I was really excited.  I saw it up there.  I'm like, Louis Black!  Old friend calling?  I said to Travis, I went in there and told him, but I almost went for Chris Rock, but  I wanted you guys to go to the phones, but I'm like, wait, what am I giving away that 
[01:21:00]  I did that?  Yeah.  See?  You know what?  Prank call Thursday.  No.  Prank call Thursday.  Well, why not?  Because that's kind of one of those hacky radio bits where they play fake prank calls, but  we would prank ourselves.  Wouldn't it be obvious when we're sitting here with our phone to our ear?  Yeah.  Although it wasn't when Jimmy did it.  It was pretty tricky.  He turned around.  Oh, you didn't see me turn around?  No.  You turned around and faked me out. 
[01:21:30]  I saw it coming.  Hey, Joanna, New Jersey, what's up?  I have been trying to stop you from eating the Tofutti Cuties.  Why?  There is no worse laxative on the planet.  It's really.  I just got a break last night by getting gas.  You guys are going to have a bad trip now to the Mohegan Sun.  You weren't listening.  I said to Jimmy, game on.  We're going at it.  I don't mind that, though.  I don't mind a bunch of gas in the car.  Yeah, we're going at it. 
[01:22:00]  We don't care.  A bunch of men with the windows rolled up just testing each other.  Jim's going to be at the craps table all night, and it's going to be in his room.  Last night.  See, you're crapping all over your room.  Last.  Oops.  Thank you, Joanna.  I don't know.  Last night, I let one go, and my chick's really cool, but she was so freaking annoyed.  How could she be really cool about that?  No, I don't.  I try not to do that in front of her, but after one of these, I didn't know what to expect. 
[01:22:30]  I was like, whoa.  It was one of those, and then I moved the covers.  I'm not even kidding.  20 minutes later, and it was horrific.  I was embarrassed.  Really?  Larry Linger.  It was bad.  Just stay there waiting.  Oh, casual Kenny back on the mic.  Casual Kenny.  What's up, casual Kenny?  Game on, please.  You know, you ever ride in the car with Jim?  They have begun.  If you ride in the car with Jim when he has an occurrence, he's very proud of them, and 
[01:23:00]  then if you roll down the window, he yells at you, going like, what are you doing?  I'm going to get a draft.  I'm going to catch a cold.  I'll catch a death of cold.  When Jimmy drives, though, he locks the windows before he lets one go, so that's special.  Yeah, he's got that.  Do you have that safety switch where people can't roll their own windows down?  Of course they do.  I wouldn't buy a car without it.  Oh, so he can blast on you and just suffer.  Oh, yeah.  That is great.  I try not to around my girlfriend too much.  I don't want to think, like, having that association. 
[01:23:30]  She hears them a lot.  A lot.  Yeah.  All the time she hears them, yeah.  Girls kind of associate that thing after a while.  You don't want to be gross.  I don't want any type of gross smells.  You don't want to be gross.  Yeah, you've got to fart by yourself, and you've got to have separate bathrooms.  We do.  We have two bathrooms.  Yeah.  We both use the same one.  We actually sit back-to-back, and we look over at each other.  I got four.  Do you really?  Yeah.  Four bathrooms?  Yeah.  God almighty. 
[01:24:00]  How many toilets do you need?  One you won't even use.  You just use a table.  You put a wood over it.  Have kids sit there and eat.  It's something about New York.  They just love bathrooms in these apartments.  I don't get it.  I honestly need one.  But every place we looked at, four.  I looked at places that had six bathrooms.  How would you ever use six bathrooms?  How many showers do you have?  And it's not like it's a seven-room place.  There's bathrooms where there shouldn't be bathrooms.  I got six.  Do you have six? 
[01:24:30]  Six bathrooms?  It's ridiculous.  I have bathrooms I haven't even seen.  How many full baths?  Four?  I got four full.  All showers?  Yes.  I have five.  That's good, though, because if you fight, you can just go shower in the other part of  the apartment.  That's cool.  Yeah, I have one half bathroom where there's no shower in it.  You know what the weird part is?  Because I've lived in squalor for so long.  Yeah.  Like, my girlfriend will be in the bathroom, and I'll wait to use the bathroom.  Why? 
[01:25:00]  Because I forget that I'm living like a human being, finally.  I'm like, oh, yeah, I could use another bathroom.  I do have my favorite bathroom, though.  You know, the master bathroom is, like I said, that's where all the action happens.  Yeah.  That's where the magic happens.  It's nice and comfy.  If I have to run into one of the other bathrooms, I don't feel as comfortable.  My surroundings are a little different.  My favorite magazines aren't in there.  Yeah.  You know?  But in the master bath.  That's where my, you know, popular mechanics, motor trend. 
[01:25:30]  It's the one with the plunger sticking out of the bowl.  Black inches, you know, continuing with your magazines.  PR thugs.  All sideways hats, packing 11.  T-H-U-G-Z.  Of course.  How else would you spell it?  Anthony's calling me out from Jersey.  He's like an apartment.  Opie, please.  Jimmy, do I live in an apartment?  He certainly does.  Maybe a little larger apartment. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, you should live in a bigger apartment.  You live in that.  The fact that you're the lead in our high-profile show and you lived where you lived for that long.  It was mind-boggling to everybody.  It was mind-boggling.  He lived with mice and roaches.  I killed the final total, by the way, because I kept track.  I'm out of my old place.  A lot of people need the update.  The official total was 52 mice.  Wow.  Electrocuted in my apartment. 
[01:26:30]  Electrocuted.  That I left.  Well, I started with the glue traps and, you know, you got to wake up in the morning and see these things suffering as their ears to the glue traps and they're still alive.  Yeah.  And then, you know, the actual mousetrap that comes down and just blood everywhere.  And then my brother says, you know, get a paper bag and put the mousetrap in the paper bag so clean up is nice.  That's kind of nice unless the blood is leaking through the freaking paper bag.  And you're throwing away your mousetrap every time.  Yeah, so I went with the electric traps and it was just a killing, a killing zone. 
[01:27:00]  The best way to do it is with glue traps and then hit them with a hammer from the tail up through the back to the head.  What do you have to slowly?  All right, here we go.  We got to interrupt the proceedings because finally Bruce Willis is calling the opiate.  Oh.  Oh, nice.  Bruce, look for your Die Hard.  What can we say, man?  The movie is great.  The new Die Hard movie.  What do you got, Bruce?  Meow.  Meow.  But I thought it was Bruce Willis. 
[01:27:30]  Wow.  It's not even Cat Noise Wednesday.  You know, I thought finally Bruce Willis was calling.  Yeah.  All right.  Can we maybe get one more fun fact?  Well, it is fun fact Thursday as well.  Dan, do you have a fun fact for fun fact Thursday?  Dan is in charge of fun fact Thursday.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Dan.  There are more living organisms on the skin of a single human being than there are human beings on the surface of the earth.  That's actually not true.  Or fun. 
[01:28:00]  It is fun.  It kind of creeps me out.  Exactly.  These are fun facts, Anthony.  Enjoy.  Got another?  In your lifetime, you'll shed over 40 pounds of skin.  That's kind of interesting.  It's not fun at all.  It happens in a 10-minute period.  Right at the end of your life.  Yes.  It's like a snake.  You just step out of your old skin and die.  Corinne, what do you got?  Corinne, Jersey, you, go. 
[01:28:30]  Maybe she's having a phone trouble.  Ha ha.  It says, love you, love phone call Thursday.  Yeah, well.  All right, listen, we've got to take another break.  Paris Hilton, when we get back, please stick around.  We got, Larry, you're really getting into the strip search that happened to Paris in jail.  It's creepy.  That I want to hear.  Larry just would not let it go.  Also, it's Perv News Thursday.  Got some great Perv News stories.  And we almost forgot, today we find out if E-Rock gets to keep Dr. Ian Smith's $500. 
[01:29:00]  That's today the way?  Was it $500?  Yeah.  Wow.  $500.  What time is Ian coming in?  He's on a book tour or something.  So we're trying to get him on the phone.  At the very least, he'll call us Monday.  But we still weigh E-Rock today and see if he lost the weight that he was supposed to lose.  Wow.  To keep the $500 that Dr. Ian Smith already gave him. 
[01:29:30]  If Ian Smith should be here, though, right?  Yeah, but here's the problem.  Because everyone's like, well, he could come in on Monday.  And I'm like, well, that's great.  But then it gives old Fatso over here three more days to lose the weight.  Uh-uh.  He gets weighed today.  He gets weighed today.  But maybe you're right.  All right.  I just think that maybe he should have been.  You're in charge of the cat noises.  I'm in charge of the cat noises.  He gets weighed today.  I'm in charge of cat noises?  Oh, well.  Thank you.  Or if you want to be dramatic, I don't know if we even want to do this, but it is an option 
[01:30:00]  and we discuss things on the air.  We can weigh him in private, have somebody trustworthy put the weight in an envelope, and then open  it up when Dr. Ian Smith is here or on the phone.  No.  You want to know today.  Yeah, because these guys can't keep a seat.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That's true.  Sam?  Trustworthy.  Here's how trustworthy Sam would be.  If he's frowning, Hawk made it.  If he's smiling, he didn't.  Have you ever tried to keep something on the QT around here?  Yes.  There's billboards in the office the next day. 
[01:30:30]  Why didn't you tell me?  Clink, clink.  It's Mountain Dew.  Is it?  Worst kept secret in radio, and he's mad at us because we didn't tell him that the station  was changing.  Happens after eating Tofutti Cuties.  Mountain Dew.  Come on.  That's funny, right?  Yeah.  It's a poo-poo joke.  Oh, damn it.  The station had new billboards up all over Manhattan, but he's mad at us because we didn't tell him  the station was changing formats.  The billboards were up before they changed.  Oh, my God.  I think they were already airing commercials. 
[01:31:00]  But you're going to blame us.  Okay, John.  Have some more Mountain Dew.  Dr. Ian Smith is calling in.  Dr. Ian Smith.  Well, we didn't even weigh E-Rock.  All right, but he heard us, and he wants to call in.  Dr. Ian Smith, now, today's the day we find out if E-Rock gets to keep the $500 you gave  him about a month ago.  Yes.  How do you feel about that?  Are you happy?  Well, I don't know. 
[01:31:30]  We'll have to get the official weight.  It's ruin the bit guy.  It's not like Dr. Ian Seinfeld.  You ruined it.  That's a good one.  Shut up.  You already ruined it.  No, now it's too late.  You, sir, are a f***ing f***ing bag.  And because of you, we banned the rest of the phone calls on Phone Call Thursday.  No more Phone Call Thursday because of him.  Because he blew the celebrity cat noise bit that Jimmy started.  But you can't punish all because of him.  I'm sorry. 
[01:32:00]  How can you ruin that bit?  How do you ruin that bit?  What did he do at the end?  You got to call up as a celebrity and do nothing but meow.  I do the long setup and all we hear is meow.  And the dope starts talking.  What an ass.  I thought it was funny because he sounded nothing like Ian Smith.  No.  He panicked and decided he sounds like Jerry Seinfeld.  I want to say.  Dan, fun fact?  No.  Well, yes.  But also, I like how Jim tried to salvage the bit by going, how do you feel about that? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  How do you feel about that?  How do you feel about that, Mr. Faber-Sham?  Yeah.  My acting wasn't good.  I should have turned around.  All right.  All right.  What am I here?  Yeah.  I'm a secret boy.  All right.  Listen.  We've been calling it in for the last two hours.  Why don't we start our radio show next, okay?  It's start our radio show next Thursday.  No.  It's it.  Oh, wait.  Fun fact coming in, though.  All right.  Fun fact.  Yes.  This is a very pertinent one.  Uh-huh.  Cats have over 100 vocal sounds, while dogs only have about 10. 
[01:33:00]  Why did you have to do the cat thing?  What was that?  Comet from the 80s, Predance Thursday?  Are you?  Why are you kissing up to Jimmy?  He's kissing up to you.  He wants some freaking stage time.  Comet, yeah.  Why would you do a fun fact cat thing?  Oh, I didn't even notice that.  Good point.  Because somebody was just ruining the cat noise bits.  Yeah.  Topical.  Right.  Well.  I have stuff about starfish that will blow your mind.  Oh, all right.  Well, that's fun facts about starfish.  That's a tease to make everyone listen longer.  I'm sure.  What part of the body they remind you of? 
[01:33:30]  Oh, we got now people calling with their fun facts.  As long as you're not calling for phone call Thursday, we'll still allow phone calls for  fun fact Thursday.  That's the compromise we'll make today.  And no more celebrity cat noise things.  That's right.  Because that ass ruined it for everybody.  No cat noises wink.  Oh, no.  Now we're going to get nothing but cat noises.  No, they'll have some fun facts.  Oh, Paris Hilton's calling in.  Really?  Dude, you got to go to the phones.  Paris Hilton, you can't play around.  She may be a fan.  That's it really is. 
[01:34:00]  What if it is?  I don't think we can take the chance because she is in the news and we talk about it.  I bet it's her.  All right.  Paris.  Hey, Paris.  Nope.  Too smart.  That wasn't Paris.  That was another one with a cat noise.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're back.  The Opie and Anthony show is returning.  The boss is eating.  Oh, that was almost a big wonder. 
[01:34:30]  Wow.  That was almost a tofutti cutie disaster.  That ran from my spine to my socks.  Well, we won't be doing that again for the rest of the program.  God, just trying to eat a little food.  We've said it many times.  You got to eat like a caveman when you do morning radio.  Just shoving food down your throat.  I woke up for a little.  In between breaks, a little queasy because I ate sushi last night, which I got in a supermarket,  which I normally don't do, but it looks fresh.  That scares me.  Yeah.  You guys eat. 
[01:35:00]  You eat that garbage out of a supermarket.  You got to go to a real place.  Have them make it fresh.  It's been wrapped up there all day.  Under the lights.  Yeah.  Well, they don't keep it under a hot light like it's one of those roasted chickens.  It's in a frozen area.  Under those hot lights.  What is it, performing?  Maybe next week we could tell our most horrific, can you say diarrhea?  Yeah, yeah.  The most horrific diarrhea stories on the next Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, nice.  It'll be in the promo and everything.  Okay.  I would say illness.  Sure.  I want to tell my potato salad story once again.  Taking it to the beach.  Pretty disgusting.  Oh, my God.  100 degrees out.  Waited about an hour and a half before I ate it.  Wow.  That sounds good.  Wow.  That could do some damage.  It is a fun fact.  All right.  For another day.  Don't do that.  What?  Because we got Paris Hilton on Larry King.  Everybody's talking about the big interview last night, right?  Yes.  Right?  Yes.  Right? 
[01:36:00]  Yes.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  Mm-hmm.  Huh?  Yeah.  What?  Well.  Someone's fired.  There it is.  I don't know what the hell I did there.  It was a who-gives-a-crap interview.  Was it?  Let's acknowledge that right off the bat.  People enjoyed it.  Just a quick clip, just in case you missed it, really quick.  And then...  Ep!  And then Ep?  Tell...  Ah!  Oh, what?  And then Ep-tel-ah. 
[01:36:30]  Ep-tel-ah.  Do you want to talk to Jerry Springer?  Wasn't he supposed to call the other day?  Is it really him, or is it going to be cat noises?  Is that Jerry Springer?  Oh, my God.  Jerry.  Meow.  Wait a minute.  Hey, how you doing?  Wait, it's really Jerry Springer, though.  It is Jerry Springer.  Am I one cool cat, or what?  Hey, what's up, Jerry?  Jerry.  Jerry.  Oh, please, don't get up.  Yeah.  Now, Jerry.  Jerry, wow, we were just about to talk about Paris Hilton, but screw it up. 
[01:37:00]  We'd rather talk to you.  Let me tell you something, Jerry.  We don't really watch the show that much anymore, but you got us hooked again with the legless  dude.  Oh, the legless dude?  That.  The tranny.  The tranny.  That cut off his own legs.  The tranny that cut off the legs with the power saw.  Yeah, that was...  I came out against it.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  There's a brave move on your part.  Let the chips fall where they may.  You know, from the leg or whatever, but you know, I'm... 
[01:37:30]  No, that was great.  That guy's kind of, you know, pouring his heart out.  Obviously, he's got some issues, and man, you're just making it into a comedy show.  The audience is laughing, and it was just great TV.  As he's telling his horrible story, your vicious audience is just laughing at him.  And you're being your sarcastic self.  It was great TV, Jerry.  It seems wrong at so many levels.  Oh, absolutely.  But I love it.  It's right.  The way he told the story, too, about how he had done the first one wrong and blood got 
[01:38:00]  all over, so the second time he set up a bucket so his foot would fall in the bucket.  Yeah.  What the hell are you thinking when that guy's on stage saying all this?  Now, of course, you've got the fights and everything.  We've seen that, but that was pretty much something I'd never seen before.  Yeah, well, that's the goal.  What haven't Opie and Anthony seen? 
[01:38:30]  Yeah.  And then that's our show, because if you haven't seen it before, we've hit the summit.  Yeah, I've noticed a lot, too.  You're kind of getting back, letting people brawl a little more.  Yeah, well, I'm not sure that ever changes, just what gets edited out.  Yeah, well, that's what I mean.  Like, they were cutting out everything.  The second people would lunge at each other, they would cut to the audience or you reacting,  and you knew the audience at home just wanted to see these two people of very limited mental 
[01:39:00]  capacity throwing punches at each other.  Yeah, well, it's, you know, always leave them wanting more.  Well, the reflexes of your security guys are a little slow.  Yeah, I like that, too.  That's what Anthony's getting at.  I think he's just getting older.  It's like, you know this woman is going to lunge at this other woman and punch her.  Why is security kind of just stand back a little bit and let that happen?  Why is security giving them, like, a minute head start?  I love it. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, you're assuming they're smart.  Right.  Yeah, that is an assumption.  How do you feel about the accusations that people on your show at times make inflammatory  remarks towards each other?  Yeah, good Lord.  Well, we're going to have Ann Coulter on when?  The next, you know, in two weeks.  Oh, you are?  You've got to love her.  No, we're not.  Of course not.  Oh, I thought you were going to have her fighting a midget or something.  That would have been awesome.  I thought Mrs., what's her name, Mrs. Edwards would come out and start ripping her clothes  off.  Yeah. 
[01:40:00]  That happens a lot on your show, too, Jerry.  I see a lot of people with their clothes ripped off and then they pixelate the boobies.  Is that happening now?  Yeah.  That is wrong.  Yeah, that is wrong.  That is wrong.  I'm just getting depressed hearing about this show.  But getting back to the guy who cut off his own legs, you weren't phased by this,  Jerry.  Well, because the show is about people that do outrageous things, so I can't then pretend  to say, oh, gee, that's outrageous.  But the guy really cut off his own legs.  I know. 
[01:40:30]  And then people say to me, the show is fake.  Yeah, the guy's legs are gone.  Honestly, when he walked out, he walked out with no legs.  So I'm not fake.  And he did a horrific job.  I mean, there's just like meat hanging.  Yeah.  I mean, the guy obviously had issues.  Jerry, here's a question I wanted to ask you.  Now, there are some instances where the guests on your show are having a problem.  It's usually maybe the baby doesn't belong to the father or there's somebody cheating  with somebody else.  And you'll see a woman sitting there heartbroken and she starts crying. 
[01:41:00]  And the audience, of course, is laughing.  The other people on the stage might be laughing.  But I look at Jerry.  A lot of times they put the camera on Jerry.  And you've got this somber face, like you kind of care about what's going on.  And as if you're almost hushing the crowd, like, someone's hurting here.  Let's take that into consideration.  What's going through your mind when things like that are happening? 
[01:41:30]  I would think that you think I'm cynical.  Well, I'm like anybody else.  You know, when you hear a horrible story, it's not, oh, this is wonderful.  Right.  Know what Jerry's thinking?  And then I've got to remember what time the bank closes.  Thank you.  Thank you, Jerry.  Thank you.  There it is.  You know, sometimes in the Midwest, sometimes they close at five.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jerry's telling the audience to quiet down because they're going to run over.  Well, he wants to get to the bank.  He wants them to quiet down because he's trying to concentrate on what he wants to eat that night. 
[01:42:00]  It's like, ah, steak.  Is that what he's thinking?  Because sometimes you put out this very, like, thoughtful look on your face.  I had steak Friday.  That's also wrong.  All these things are wrong.  How many years have you been doing the show, Jerry?  17 years.  When did you know, like, all right, this is going to be the direction we're going in?  Like, how long in did you realize, like, this is going to stand out from the other shows?  Like, what happened that made you go, this is going to be, like, some kind of an iconic thing?  I think it was last Thursday. 
[01:42:30]  I said, geez, this show is really going crazy.  And that show got a lot of attention for you, huh, Jerry?  Yeah.  I think it was actually probably about two or three years in is when the show started going crazy.  And then when Universal bought us, NBC Universal, then we're only allowed to do crazy now.  So if someone calls us with a warm-up lifting story, we have to send them to another show.  So, you know, we're not allowed to do just the regular stuff.  Now, when you first came on, there were other shows with the same type of format, I guess, to Phil Donahue, where the audience participated. 
[01:43:00]  They brought out people on the stage and they were able to interact.  Yeah.  The first two or three years, it was a serious show.  I mean, we had...  Right.  Yeah.  I remember that.  Well, the only decision we made, and I guess this is a straight answer, the only decision we made about...  In the beginning, you're right, there were like 20 shows trying to be like Oprah, which would appeal to middle-aged housewives.  And at least that was the demographic at the time. 
[01:43:30]  But then Rikki Lake came along, and she really was the first show that went after young people.  So the only decision that I was involved in was the decision, let's go young, which meant young people in the audience, young people on stage, young subject matter.  Right.  Well, young people are wilder.  They're much more open about their lifestyles or whatever.  So the show started going crazy.  Then NBCUniversal bought us, and they said, from now on, you're only allowed to do crazy.  And that's when it all started.  Yeah, bringing on a lot of overweight people that seem to have affairs with... 
[01:44:00]  The audience or the people?  Well, yeah, the audience, sure, sure.  But a lot of overweight people come out, and they bring out people that are cheating.  I'm very surprised sometimes.  Sometimes there's good-looking people with the real slobs.  Well, they get lost in the building because there are other shows that are done in the building.  They think they're somewhere else.  Sometimes, when you get off the elevator, if you don't make a hard ride, then you're going to wind up on our show, and that's the problem. 
[01:44:30]  Jerry, I know you've probably been asked this a lot, but what's the craziest thing you've seen on your show?  Legless guy, or where does someone beat legless guy?  Guy cutting off his own legs.  Well, I Married My Horse.  You certainly want to put that in the top.  Yeah, I Married My Horse was a biggie.  Yeah, that was...  Literally.  And we did a follow-up show.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  The horse left him, which is true.  It's funny.  He took everything.  The guy had nothing but an empty stable with a pile of dung. 
[01:45:00]  Well, actually, in his home, because we went to his home.  Yeah.  This is so wrong.  But anyway, so we went to his home, and his hallways were extra wide so the horse could go up and down.  And this is true.  Great.  Oh, my God, great.  What a kook.  But did he have sex with the horse, and the horse compared him to all of her ex-husbands?  And he'd go, well, you know what they say.  The horse left, said he was hung like a man or something. 
[01:45:30]  There you go.  Hey, Jerry, we're heading for a break here.  America's Got Talent on NBC Tuesday at 8.  You're a guest host or something?  No, I am the host.  Oh, I didn't know that.  He's the host.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  The show's really been doing well.  Yeah, it's the top-rated show right now, so...  Very cool.  Yeah, it's fun.  It's totally different.  It's obviously a regular show, not my crazy show.  Jerry's just managed to stay relevant for so many years.  Just keep buying new suits.  It's part of popular culture, man.  As being the mayor, you know, everyone knows the trouble you had and stuff. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, did you think at that moment...  No, but honestly, I know you keep saying that, but what you're referring to is five years  before I ever became mayor.  Mm-hmm.  Those stories...  Mm-hmm.  Oh, okay.  Oh, really was.  I didn't know that.  I actually thought you were mayor when it happened.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  It was the worst things happened when he was mayor.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He was doing it openly.  What were you doing for a living when that happened?  I was a lawyer.  Did you, at that point, when you get, like, in trouble for that, for, you know, paying  with a check, all of a sudden think, like, I'm going to someday be the mayor and then 
[01:46:30]  go on to be an icon in this country?  I mean, how weird is it, like...  Oh, my love.  I've been the luckiest guy in the world.  I mean, I really have.  Were you depressed, I'm saying, when that happened?  No, I mean, it just...  No, I mean, I wasn't...  It was...  I guess, what, 27?  You know, I mean, I...  You know, I...  I wasn't thinking anything about what my life was going to be.  Just a dopey kid looking to get a little on the side.  It was before you were born, guys.  Pay for it with a check.  Yeah. 
[01:47:00]  Cash.  Cash, Jerry, cash.  I'm still feeling bad about it.  Yeah, sure you are.  Where is that check?  Do you still have it?  Did you get it back?  No, it never was cash, so, therefore, it never happened.  It was never cash.  Yo, you ran back with some cash.  Hey, don't cash that check.  How good of a campaign do you have to run where your opponent is throwing that up and you  still become mayor?  What was his platform?  Genocide for everyone?  No, no, only the people in the western half of town.  I mean, that is a hell of a campaign. 
[01:47:30]  All right, Jerry, good luck.  Good luck, man.  Like you need it.  Thank you, man.  Don't start dying your hair like Maury.  Maury has reached the age where, you know, him dying his hair looks just creepy.  No, no, no.  And we love Maury, but we got to get him on the phone and tell him to stop dying his hair.  He's too old for that now.  Okay.  You reach an age where you got to just let it go, Jerry.  Jerry, so far you're good, but we're keeping track.  I do have a walker.  That's fine.  I'll see you later.  Hit people with it.  Jerry Springer, everyone.  That was a surprise.  I didn't think it was him when I heard the meow at first. 
[01:48:00]  I thought people were being smartasses again.  All right.  I have to know who he beat in that campaign.  I had no idea he got busted with a hooker five years before.  Yeah.  Yeah, and they just paid with a check.  How do you win the election?  To the order of filthy whore.  No, you put to the order of her name and then under the memo section.  You put for the deed she did.  Yeah, the awful deed in full detail.  See reverse and on the back there's more details.  Paris Hilton on Larry King.  Now we're running really late and we got to squeeze in the E-Rock weighing. 
[01:48:30]  We got to do perv news.  We got lots to do here.  Come on.  Paris on Larry King.  The obvious, the purpose of jail, prison, jail, confinement, is to teach a lesson.  Yes.  That's a big part of it.  Did it work with you?  It's definitely, it was a very traumatic experience, but I feel like God does make everything happen  for a reason.  God now?  And it gave me, you know, a time out in life just to really find out what is important 
[01:49:00]  and what I want to do, figure out who I am.  And even though it was really hard, I took that time just to get to know myself.  Now I'm kind of confused.  Are we listening to someone that just got out of jail after spending 10 years for wrongly  being accused of murder?  Yeah, something like that.  Like something like that.  Or someone that spent a couple of weeks.  Oh, we just suck in this country.  We all just eat this crap up.  This is such a non-story.  Absolutely.  Some dumb blonde bimbo that has had everything handed to her in her entire life. 
[01:49:30]  A lot about myself.  Had to do what, three weeks in jail?  Well, she said she discovered a lot about herself.  And her conclusion is, I'm a ****.  Yes.  That's right.  We do Mad Libs on this show.  Yeah.  Mad Lib Thursday?  No.  No.  Because what I said actually was, I'm a goose.  Right.  You responded, I think, holding a Bible or something.  Yeah.  Did you take a Bible with you?  Yes, I did.  Well, actually, we weren't allowed to bring one in, but... 
[01:50:00]  Not allowed.  I ordered one off the commissary list.  Not allowed.  Not allowed to bring books in?  You can't bring anything in.  Nothing.  Are you a religious person?  I've always been religious.  I went to Catholic school as a child, and...  Were you mewling rosary beads?  Even more so now, after being in jail.  Of course she's religious.  She knows how to polish the bishop.  Old but dependable. 
[01:50:30]  Of course.  She's...  I was trying to think of what is it that the cardinal uses when he's throwing water on you?  Oh.  Oh, the thingy thing.  The holy water blessing thingy.  Oh, yeah.  Thing.  Because Rick Solomon...  Thingy thing.  Rick Solomon certainly possessed one of those.  In a green light.  Is that when you got religious, you dirty whore?  I love her.  Was anyone listening to this last night or watching it?  I love her.  I really need to know what she went through.  What did she go through?  It must have been so difficult for her. 
[01:51:00]  By the way, we're just giving you a taste, because the Larry talking about the strip search  is where we're heading.  Yeah.  With this.  So just hang in.  So the party girl aspect is you like to party, but it's not drugs.  No.  I just like to go out and have fun with my friends.  I'm an Aquarius.  We're social people.  You gonna stop doing that?  Can you change that?  You know, I've realized that there's a lot more important things in life, and there's  a lot more things to do, and I'm frankly sick of it.  You know, I've been going out for a long time now, and yeah, it's fun, but it's not going 
[01:51:30]  to be the mainstay of my life anymore.  This is why Larry sucks, and he has to finally retire.  You're asking her, like, these questions and listening to what she has to say.  I'm asking the hard questions.  You got her right in front of you.  Just beat her up.  He stinks.  Pro or con, Welch's grape juice.  Like, why not say people think that, do you feel like you've had everything handed to 
[01:52:00]  you and you've never had to work for it?  Like, why not hit that angle of it?  Because that would be interesting.  It'd be interesting to hear how she responded to that.  What type of shampoo did you use in prison?  Did it give your hair the body you wanted?  He just gives these stupid, stupid, wiffle ball questions.  They're nothing.  So many people say that Larry King is brilliant and all that.  I'm brilliant.  And I watch him to try to figure it out.  I can't figure it out.  I can't figure it out with this guy. 
[01:52:30]  Softball interviews.  He's terrible.  It's Paris Hilton.  She's a bimbo.  I saw Shawshank.  Did you get your friends to tar a roof?  Absolute bimbo.  Listen to these questions.  How have all these stories gotten out about you?  Medications.  Well, the ADT, that's a strong medication, isn't it?  ADT?  What?  How about Valtrex, stupid?  Anyone who has ADT takes it.  You've had it all your life?  Yes. 
[01:53:00]  But the stories about you being use of drugs and the like.  What does she have?  Wild seems all wrong.  What?  People make up so many crazy stories.  The things I read about and things I see is not the person who I am.  I got it.  I didn't actually.  I got it after the second time.  Oh, man.  I read this.  I don't know.  It might be a complete rumor, but someone said she takes Valtrex, which has been associated  with a herpes cure.  The herp.  But why wouldn't he ask her about it?  Do you have the herp like members of the Motley Crue? 
[01:53:30]  Just let her clear up the rumor.  So to speak.  Should we take a break and then get into...  Yeah, we'll take a break here.  This is riveting stuff.  Yeah, but the next one is where we're heading.  Larry talks to Paris about the strip search.  Yeah.  And then she answers the question, but Larry can't let it go.  Did you back your tushy against the bars and let the guards have their way with you? 
[01:54:00]  You're tushy.  You had to take dumps in a toilet without walls around it.  How was that, Paris?  Any embarrassing moments after you had some of that horrible prison food?  What is that they serve you?  S.O.S.?  That's f*** on a shingle.  We ate that in the war, during the war.  Doesn't it come out the same way it goes in Paris?  Answer. 
[01:54:30]  It should have been a quick question, but Larry's like...  The pervy side of Larry came out a little bit last night.  Yeah.  We'll show you next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Where the hell were we?  Oh, Paris Hilton on Larry King.  Right.  I've been eating my egg white omelet with vegetables for the last two hours. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, I thought you were going to say you were eating your cutie.  No, no, no, no.  Tofutti cuties.  That already left me.  Did it?  Oh, my God.  Did you leave it behind?  Oh, my God.  Oh, then you yelled, game on?  You challenged me and then got rid of your best weapon?  Yeah.  Oh, aren't you going to be a sad boy for...  Hey, what happened to you?  Like, 20 minutes ago, you attempted one, and you said there was almost a disaster.  Exactly, but I can't keep control.  Well, I prevented the disaster by going over there and doing my thing. 
[01:55:30]  Jesus, did it still feel cold?  I barely even touched your insides.  Something about that tofu.  It goes right through you.  I swear.  Not a fan of the tofu, I'm deciding.  No.  All right, Paris Hilton on Larry King.  Larry King.  Here's the strip search question.  Larry's a perv.  An embarrassing thing with it, were you strip searched?  Do they do that in jail?  Yes.  Or do they do it in prison?  They do.  They do it in any jail.  What was that like?  Oh, what was that like? 
[01:56:00]  They're in prison?  No, they do it in prison.  Do they do it in jail?  Please tell me they do it in jail.  You were strip searched.  What was that like?  What a perv.  Listen to him.  Larry King never asks a follow-up question.  He's all worked up.  But he certainly did there.  Follow-up.  What was it like?  What was it like?  Details.  Follow-up.  Glove or no glove? 
[01:56:30]  What was used?  I've got a pre-sign no glove.  What did they find?  Yeah.  What were you bringing into the joint?  A shiv?  I know my prison lingo.  What were you hiding?  Yeah.  Did you get a swastika tat on your ass?  I've seen the videos.  It looks like you could hide a lot.  Tell me about it.  There was a oops-a-daisy shot of you getting out of a limousine, which told me you could have 
[01:57:00]  muleed in a bazooka.  True or false?  Details.  Is garlic on the contraband list?  Because I need garlic if I ever go to the joint.  Is it true?  Yeah.  Smuggled in the Motley Crue.  The Motley Crue.  Ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:57:30]  He wants to hear about that strip search, man.  Man, there's not even a pause before the follow-up.  Listen.  An embarrassing thing with it, were you strip searched?  Do they do that in jail?  Yes.  Or do they do it in prison?  They do.  They do it in any jail.  What was that like?  That was the most humiliating experience of my life.  My suspenders are getting tight.  Now she says the most humiliating thing she's ever...  Come on.  All right.  You can't say that if you've been on videotape. 
[01:58:00]  Right.  We've seen her video.  Everyone has.  Yeah.  That would be a little more humiliating.  It's not like she was strip searching and turned around and...  I never had to do that.  You know, doing that in front of someone you don't even know.  It's pretty embarrassing.  Is there a one police officer in you in a room?  Yeah.  Larry will not drop it.  Let me set the scene.  Let me...  A hot, voluptuous woman screw. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  And she's strip searching you.  She's got big torpedoes.  Yeah.  Huge.  And she's wearing one of those Gene Russell pointy bras.  Right?  Yeah.  Hot.  Even Larry can't make this hot.  Stupid Larry.  Yeah.  How did they pick the security guard, the screw that was going to search you?  Was there a lottery?  Did they draw straws? 
[01:59:00]  Did you have any say in the matter?  What do you prefer?  Thick fingers or small ones?  Answer.  Glove or no glove?  Paris, answer.  I need an answer.  So...  Answer slowly.  You're in a small room with old torpedo s**t.  And Paris is trying to move on.  Yeah.  Oh, he won't stop with the goddamn questions about the search of a cavity. 
[01:59:30]  Yes.  Is it as gross as we might think it is?  He just keeps...  Yeah.  Is it as gross?  Gross?  He's been broadcasting for 50 years.  That's what he comes up with.  Was it yucky?  Was it as gross?  All right.  There's nothing...  You're in there.  There's nothing gross about that.  We've all seen the Prison Babe films back in the day.  A matronly screw is in there and she's going to search you. 
[02:00:00]  Benny Goodman plays lightly in the background.  Taking all the hotness out of a prison strip search.  You barely showered the powder to delouse you off of yourself when she asked you to grab  your ankles for the cavity search.  Hold on.  Was the search something we like to call the old two-hander? 
[02:00:30]  Did they do the old grip and rip?  Did she try to clap?  And she couldn't.  And you said, tight, isn't it?  That old gag.  I'm sure he's finally done with the strip search stuff. 
[02:01:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Is it as gross as we might think it is?  Well, it's pretty gross, you know.  Taking your clothes off in front of someone and having to do that.  You understand why they do it.  Yeah.  It just keeps going.  Do you get why they do it?  Because it's hot.  Was it gross?  I mean, how can I put this?  On your birth control pills, were you on the seven that are a different color from the rest? 
[02:01:30]  When you were done, did the room smell like dirty pennies?  How many people got to watch?  We were in birth control. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, man.  It's funny.  You don't mind this playing in the background, do you?  Makes it hotter.  I could really conjure up an image of Arabeci getting you between the bars.  Back up that tootsie.  Did the lousy screw have the common courtesy to remove her rings?  Or did you steal a couple with no hands? 
[02:02:30]  How many high school rings did they find?  Paris answer.  I want to know a little more about this strip search.  How much time's left in the show?  We're going to go long.  Screw Geraldo.  Be careful how you answer.  I've had ten heart attacks.  Watch your answers.  Are you a fan of Linda Blair? 
[02:03:00]  Did they call that area of your body the situation room?  Is it true?  It's the no spin zone.  Whatever that means.  Just going with your situation.  Building on that.  He really seems to enjoy that line of questioning.  I've never heard him ask so many questions.  I once said, was it gross? 
[02:03:30]  I bet it was.  Can we reenact it here, please?  But he's kind of saying, people are saying that's gross.  But I don't know a human alive that finds that gross when you hear that someone was strip  searched.  No.  I think hot bimbo was strip searched.  Yeah, especially Paris.  What could possibly be gross about that?  He's just trying to get an answer without going, now, let's get to the hot part, the full  body cavity search.  She might clam up after that.  Speaking of clam. 
[02:04:00]  Did your nervous  hoes stink up the room?  Oh, wow.  God damn.  I love him.  Yeah.  Now, is it true they put that little pen light in their mouth so they have more hands, 
[02:04:30]  more fingers to use to feel around Paris answer?  Please.  Did it sound like this?  Paris answer.  Is this actual audio from her speaking during the cavity search? 
[02:05:00]  I wish Larry was hooked up to some kind of heart machine while he was asking her these  questions.  Oh, God.  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep,  beep, beep, beep, beep.  One more question  As she's talking about finding God 
[02:05:30]  And changing for good  It's like beep  Beep  Beep  So  The body  Cavity search  What was it like  Going in there  And having that matronly woman  Actually take her hand  And  Larry 
[02:06:00]  Larry are you okay  I have a new outlook on life  Beep  Beep  New outlook  Great  Fantastic  I've changed for good Larry  I'm going to use my life  For good causes  Yeah better yourself  I heard it before  Right  Yeah  Uh huh  So  You know Larry  I didn't serve time  I let this time serve me 
[02:06:30]  Huh  I was nodding off  I think it's my sleep apnea  Well I could  I could talk about the strip search  A little more if you would like  Okay I'm back  Yeah bruises are just  Running in during the break  Standing there with a defibrillator  Clear  Oh no  You gotta bring Larry back  I was just thinking about the 
[02:07:00]  Strip search  Again  Okay back to the interview  Yeah  Someone put some garlic under my tongue  I don't know what that'll do  Did the room smell like garlic  After the cavity search  Does he say any more about the cavity search  I think he finally got off that  Did he finally wrap up  Yeah he finally wrapped up the cavity search there

[02:12:30]  You didn't make it  Hold on a minute  Yeah  That's a weird question  I'm not playing  Devil's advocate for him  But would it have been  More accurate  To weigh him  First thing in the morning  Before you ate  Well he got weighed  At roughly the same time  Right  Yeah  So it's all relative  And we purposely made sure  We didn't weigh him  Because we knew  He couldn't help himself  And had to have a little snack  He didn't eat two pounds of food  And an orange  That was it  Huh  He's still got a lot of breakfast  Why don't you get back on the scale  Maybe the scale was wrong  I wanted to  So if you're not  Watch Wade

[02:13:30]  There was a couple of times  Where we were at places  Where they didn't have anything  I could eat  So I just didn't eat at all  Oh of course  But yeah  I think Eric did great man  And I would love to beat him up  But I think that  You lost 18 pounds  You missed it by two pounds  Man that is not  If he missed it by six pounds  I'd be teasing him  No he looks good  The last week and a half  Was really hard  Because I was hitting like 197  And it was really like  Impossible to try to break that  I was ranging 196-197  Keep doing it though  You'll lose it  Wait can I ask you something  Did you have his dinner last night? 
[02:14:00]  Uh no actually  I had  I would have fasted  The last two days  I would have just drank water  And  The last time I had  What was in the diet  Was around five o'clock  And that was it  Take a good look at him now  Because he's done with this  He's going back  You're going right back  Up to where you were  Big steaks and fries  So  Is his chick's happy with it  So you missed by two pounds  And you ended up losing how much?  A hundred dollars  In a month and a half?  Oh sorry  True true  Uh  Two foot  So  Eighteen pounds  That's not bad

Next time take diuretics  What is that?  They make you go to the bed  Book by L. Ron Hubbard  Yeah  I would have never  Diuretics  It's changed my life  I would have never lost his bed  I would have fasted  I would have  I would have taken laxatives  I would have done everything  The diet doesn't allow you  To skip any meals 
[02:15:00]  And when I was in a tough place  I'd rather not eat them  You know I was keeping track  Because they don't  These guys don't care  But I'm not going to cheat on the damn thing  You shut up  And win the bet  For 500 bucks  You buy the book  That's right  You win the bet  Dr. Ian Smith out  And then go back to not cheating  Iraq did great  And he's doing it  Because his girl is happy now  That's why he's going to stay on it  Because she's probably banging him more  And do you notice that her eyes  Are open now during sex?  You look good Iraq  I can't lie to you  You look great  I'm kind of bummed  You missed by two pounds  But there you go

[02:30:00]  a pair of nobody nothings who for some inexplicable reason cajoled invigled  wormed their way into a major market radio station no not a major market radio stations  major market radio stations see that's plural yeah for many years we have been on major market radio  stations yeah we have not been out of a top 10 market in uh uh 12 years since we've been together 
[02:30:30]  except for the time we had to take off but yeah well that was when we weren't on radio at all  yeah good point good point jesus christ you douchebag then network and finally satellite  radio proving once again talent ability experience funniness funniness and just plain worthiness  are no criteria for being able to suck in obscene suck in obscene bucks without any tangible effort or 
[02:31:00]  justification this guy's jealous you know he is a jealous bad boy he's jealous douchebag who's got  a shitty nothing show he's not from nine to ten he's on an hour and no one no one knows who he is  or listens to if it wasn't for us talking about him i would know who the fuck he is he has a fake  radio voice yeah not only fake anger fake passion he's an angry conservative but he's got to try to  distance himself and separate himself from the other conservatives yeah so he uses the type of  language that regular guys you right look at me and for pete's sake let's give some advice to dick fat 
[02:31:30]  boy uh farrell yes see the reason we're on a lot of stations and on satellite for many many years  we're doing our own thing you're doing rush limbaugh see rush limbaugh is already on a ton of stations  in the big markets they don't need a rush limbaugh wannabe because they have rush limbaugh see the  secret of radio is to try to do your own thing and uh then then your worth goes up the guy lacks 
[02:32:00]  sincerity you know he doesn't just he's not this guy on the radio and real conservatives defend uh  uh stuff they want less government involved in your life and uh guys like sean hannity and you can't  get much more conservative than hannity uh uh was very open-minded about the whole uh uh because it's  all about the condolese rice thing and and they were very open he's very open-minded about that so  a guy like rush limbaugh i don't think he said anything stupid none of those guys did well sean  hannity another guy doing his own thing yeah here he goes he's in that political talk genre but he's 
[02:32:30]  doing his own thing and that's why he's syndicated all over america this guy is doing rush limbaugh and  that's why he's stuck in west palm paying paying a company to do a radio show is he paying for this yes  he pays money to do an hour on west palm beach uh radio and he's gonna trash us  oh we never had a pay to do a radio show fat boy he pays to do his own yeah it's like an infomercial  it's like if you bought an hour of commercial time on a station you would be able to go on there and 
[02:33:00]  and say whatever you want as long as it's within the guidelines he instead of airing a commercial for  an hour airs his show you so his show is an infomercial for himself you fat embarrassed  isn't that just embarrassing wait a minute can we find out who his advertisers are  let's find out who is advertising i don't think his advertising is advertising oh really  hey let's let's offer let's offer the station more money than he's paying for his hour let's buy his 
[02:33:30]  hour from him but the stipulation is they can't move him to another hour i don't even care they  have to let's let's pay whatever let's whatever he's paying for the hour let's pay that much for  a half hour and make him do a 30 minute show and our half hour is a very good idea is nothing but cat  sounds sounds how much do you think he pays you guys know right it's gotta be nothing i mean is it 
[02:34:00]  ten thousand a show no no way in this market yeah a couple hundred maybe couple of hundred bucks  offer them a grand yeah and they'll take and they will scoop it up and we will do his part of the  show get the west palm beach let's make this work we'll collect some money and and we'll get the  pesta show on that station in his time slot and all you guys do is cat noises for an hour let's pay  for his uh let's pay for the time slot and take his slot and we'll pay more than he's paying right  of course david from south carolina david hey how's it going yes i'm a little confused yeah what 
[02:34:30]  is uh anthony's real name is it anthony is it andy or dopey i know i my mother doesn't even know  what to call me anymore aren't you dopey yeah yes that'll be a dopey thing is a little played out  there wait a minute by the way yeah uh phony guy that he is he's taking this big racial stand an  unnecessary racial stand yeah and now i'm looking at the gm for the radio station and he's a black 
[02:35:00]  guy so apparently this guy who can only do one hour of radio is sucking up to what he maybe i  don't know what the gm really feels but he's sucking up to the gm by by taking such an over the top over  the top ridiculous yeah ridiculous stand uh in his little article here yet he's this right wing guy  guy who isn't typically uh very sympathetic to african-american causes no and but he's oh  you don't give a fuck about black people his appearance he's a bit overweight he's got poofy 
[02:35:30]  hair and he's got a jizz sponge on his face jizz sponge a bit overweight it's a big 70s  porno mustache isn't it i i like to call it a jizz sponge so this i'm hoping that uh that term takes  off new term thursday jizz sponge jizz sponge this next paragraph yeah all right it is just  it's everything you hate about humanity yeah well here he goes now here he goes getting things wrong 
[02:36:00]  whatever uh the recent attack on an african-american female condi rice by these two low lives in no shape  way or form comes even within 100 light years of the innocuousness of the ridiculous comments  by another unfunny anacross gnostic way use big words yeah the one donald i'm ass and now

[02:44:30]  where are we uh we were down here i'm ass by uh i'm ass uh don i'm ass yeah yet for some unfathomable  reason the word fired was never heard as far as our situation goes uh jesse jackass and al charlatan  were unseen the word apology unspoken and for the most part no outrage all this despite the  glowing portrayal of a prominent black woman being raped and joked about no outrage this guy did you 
[02:45:00]  watch tv for everything this guy missed everything no outrage they were outraged  uh there was plenty of outrage thank you believe me read the next one and the people you mentioned  were involved and there was an apology and the word fired was thrown around you are an idiot dope this  guy is so uninformed and yet he's writing like he knows it all when in the history of the republic were 
[02:45:30]  white guys able to make fun of rape demean black women and all the while get a tap on the wrist wait a  minute he's when in the history of the republic in the history of the republic were white guys allowed  to make fun of rape demean black women is he joking how about the entire history of the republic save  50 years 50 how about from 96 on what is he talking about he's actually saying when in the history of 
[02:46:00]  the republic were white guys able to make fun of rape demean black women and all the while get a tap  on the wrist in the history of the republic a tap on the wrist was the first step towards anything  being done about the demeaning of black women because for many years you could do whatever  you want with no consequence with complete impunity and then you know a tap on the wrist built into a  real criminal prosecution what is he talking about it's because he's not giving any thought to  he's trying so hard to write something profound yeah that he just is and and this just exposes what an 
[02:46:30]  uneducated uh unintelligent uh unintelligent jerk off this jerk off uh by the way uh breaking news  here we got uh some info for the past yes oliver in st louis go ahead oliver i love you i love the  show man thanks man thank you sorry to force you to call newports man newports yeah i was calling to see  if my ramon call got through oh we don't know oh i don't know we're taping no oh they're rolling

[02:47:30]  i'm positive all right i have to take that back you cannot do that i have to take that right there  that is a health issue for the postal people that would be i did not know everybody else yes when  did they make that rule it's very illegal they make that rule uh it's been in play for quite a  while well back in the day we used to talk to that company that would do this for you yeah it's it's  illegal if you had a boss or somebody that you didn't like they would uh they would do deliver dog 
[02:48:00]  duty so they made it illegal yeah last few years yeah it's it's illegal isn't it beautiful that they  have i'm sorry that they had something happened where they go look no no no no no shit in the mail yes  i honestly had no idea so please don't do that you're a comic just fucking around i know yeah well you  never know these days uh i'm a comic jimmy yeah oh oh thank you after tap on the wrist what's that  what rub trying to read let's go sorry it's got to try oh but what happened sorry okay i'm just so  excited by this guy's writing i can't stop i love his next thing well so-called rap really crap stars 
[02:48:30]  do it all the time talking about demeaning black women see he says rap stars and then he goes really  crap stars he calls rap crap uh by using it in the word yeah why don't you say that right  in front of jay-z see what yeah see what happens to you black performers do it all the time i'm uh  in the uh i'm the i'm ass case in the i'm ass in the i'm ass case it was punished with uh severity 
[02:49:00]  not so with opie and dopey the now thugs national organization for women uh who'd ordinarily beat down  the door of the stations where it was uttered were uh conspicuously absent the race pimps al and jesse  were busy with their coke spoons and trollops to care and the liberal pinko commie media  pinko commie dude i hate the liberal media and even i don't think they're  commies what year is this no one has used commie pinko since like the the the 80s early 80s 
[02:49:30]  had nothing to do say with it either the women the woman is a brilliant accomplished educated  successful conservative bush appointed secretary of state as a result the horror reserved for  i'm ass and others was ignored um can i interrupt sure i'm sad again what happened  casper in chicago opie don't take jimmy's you're a comic as a compliment he did just bomb horribly 
[02:50:00]  last night oh that's true so you wouldn't know next what funny is good point casper i did eat my  fat balls now now i'm sad again maybe my girlfriend will cheer me up exactly maybe compare something  else with diapers around them that your assholes smelled like a romantic household  all right sorry so now we can say any indignation and complaints from now thugs black agitators and  commie media pundits will have no merit simply because they have chosen to be selective in their 
[02:50:30]  indignation use indignation twice in there i love that their angst is fake phony and false like yours  yes you jerk off and means nothing more than crocodile tears  oh no substance if you were out to lunch on the attack on condoleezza rice as uh may uh you may as well  had he had he had oprah been the target as you may yeah you may as well had oprah been the target 
[02:51:00]  you may as well be had had oprah been the yeah he he's not a good right no dick you're not a bright guy  he's not smart you're not a bright guy can one imagine if a national conservative host had suggested  rape for oprah silly no one could ever imagine even that it would be just too past uh the pale 
[02:51:30]  what does that mean this guy is a cliche obsessed ass and i say that with an a and two dollar sign  so it's not dirty folks do you think you'd ever see another news story event take its place for a  while well maybe 9 11 something like that a fat cunt but i spell it with a k  i dare use snakes for us because say the dollar signs are used if savage o'reilly or limbaugh had  made fun of a possible rape on hallie berry oprah winfrey uh vivica fox or diana rice it would take 
[02:52:00]  world war three to get it off the minds of the nerds in the newsroom of the commie liberal media but it's  funny that he's saying nerds indignation is no indignation if you're not always indignant at the  same thing indignant he is an ass uh uh yes iraq has an update um i just recorded a phone call they 
[02:52:30]  just had involving chubby bunny master poe and did a rock scream before he hung up  yeah hang on one second all right iraq right on this guy wants to be rush limbaugh so bad  chubby bunny the commie lib media that's that's like rush limbaugh stuff all right  jesus  i got it if you want to yeah oh let's hear this call uh all right all right and bleacher anthony just did  three minutes on his show cool yeah all right good is this the one uh i don't know i just started 
[02:53:00]  recording as soon as i heard master poe's name uh let's go there we go they were talking about the  situation uh in our local paper do you have any idea about that do you mean the comments made by  ann coulter about hillary yeah about how hillary clinton was playing chubby bunny and then master  poe was angry about it i don't think i'm familiar with this entire scenario but if you're if you're  going to us tell me that ann coulter did something wrong well there's a whole lot of other people who 
[02:53:30]  said similar things about president bush and richard nixon and henry hyde and uh right newt gingrich i  mean you know what's good for the goose is good for the gander it's amazing that the other one  another cliche game that uh they're all it's okay for them to do it but not okay for republicans  exactly can i give you a rock scream  that was fabulous  hey john you got good lungs man keep working on that someday they might be of some good use  oh that's good did he say what's good for the goose is good for the gander oh 
[02:54:00]  this guy's all he's awful it's beautiful it's like peeling the layers off a onion  he becomes more and more awful with every moment i almost like him hey could you guys just get a  montage of uh his dumb cliches all right good what do you got what you got what the guy who did it is  on line five oh all right hey uh what was his name i didn't hear it on bleacher anthony was that you on

[02:57:00]  a path less traveled i don't know but it really hurts so um he knows that i don't like it  will you put it in in your ass no no no he turn you like picks me up and turns me on my side like  like so that i'm totally i don't know the side thing with the one leg bent  uh what yeah it's complicated but i don't like it and it really hurts it's a little too complicated  you know yeah some of those positions are made for acrobats you know which way i like 
[02:57:30]  the girl's on her stomach and you turn her on her side a little bit not just a teeny bit of an angle  and her legs are flat let's say she pulls her left knee up almost like picture a running trophy  when someone is running on the trophy the way the leg is yeah on the side a little bit and then uh oh  that's how you sneeze normally i do i don't think i've ever heard jimmy sneeze that's the funniest 
[02:58:00]  sneeze i've ever heard you should have sneezed last night at the cellar i know i uh but while  she's like laying on kind of on her side like that i like to kneel behind her straight up and  fuck that way that way my balls are resting on one ass cheek oh that's pretty similar to what  hold on another sneeze from jimmy no he missed it oh that sucks when i had to sneeze when you have  to and it just doesn't uh yeah it doesn't come out but yeah i i was kind of a boring story i apologize  no no all right we're getting some positioning you're gonna get some audio from this uh awful show

[02:59:30]  we have a mic set up oh yeah put the mic further away from me i don't like when people i don't know  yet why did you say the eight or nine she said she was an eight or nine from portland oregon i forgot  her name sarah i think sarah and my sister sarah from florida street and uh you want to bring her in  or you want to go to break what do you want to do break no i don't think we could just uh let her run 
[03:00:00]  yeah let's where where is she oh okay as long as you give me a fork i can continue see the guys  they kind of set the mic up a little close to me and sometimes i don't want to be close to these  people and then when they come in and i find out they're cool then i don't care but the initial  thing should be yeah pretty far back yeah because i don't know i'm the first line of defense here  i have to protect little jimmy over there the console protects opi but we're outside of the fortress  as it would be and if uh anybody was attacked first it would be me all right that's why i'm 
[03:00:30]  i'm bulking up she's 5 10 34 c's 135 pounds she says she's an eight or a nine eight or a nine those  are some high numbers when 10 is the top all right here we go and here she comes first impression i  like this when they walk in the door and you get that first glimpse that's what i want to say  and here she comes and as she walks in oh danny oh wow i thought you looked like danny hi yuck 
[03:01:00]  now she stop it now uh that's the boyfriend you can just sit your ass right down because we won't  be speaking to you at all uh she's cute yeah i think so too yeah she's got the she's got tats on  her you got a lot of tats on your milky white skin what that's the way we roll in portland yeah not  one needle it's another i understand and uh there's like a one right on her shin some kind 
[03:01:30]  of uh tribal work and then there's a like a fucking book report on your uh bicep it's a nietzsche  quote what's the quote ah uh do you want me to tell you the whole thing yeah yeah i bet you have  it memorized i totally you better yeah all right uh it says you tell me life is hard to bear but if it  were otherwise why should you have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening  life is hard to bear but do not pretend to be so tender we are all of us pretty fine asses and  but what have we in common with the rosebud which trembles because a drop of dew is lying upon it 
[03:02:00]  it is true we love life but not because we are used to living it is because we're used to loving  there's always a certain madness in love but also there is always a certain method and madness  why couldn't you get something this is the thing like my motto is loose lips sink ship  and that on your arm would be much easier and faster it it would be did you have that last  time i've met sarah before did you have that last time i would i do or no no i think i got it um  pretty shortly after we met oh cool and that in a nutshell means what uh life sucks but you're 
[03:02:30]  harder than you think you are you're stronger than you oh stronger than you think you are okay the  whole dew on the rose thing okay do kind of you know that's like the repressive oppressive kind of  but it's still you know the nice rose can rise above that i don't know what the fuck i'm saying  uh then then the tribal work just tribal work yeah do you have the tat above your ass nope you didn't  do that any that we're not seeing right now uh yeah i've got cherries on my hips cherries on your hips 
[03:03:00]  mm-hmm and anything on the back at all um yeah i do i have a pretty big one on my back oh you do  yeah can we see please oh yeah look at that right at the base of our neck and that says uh come me  i can't read from this far away um it's latin it means everything that is me is with me  yeah oh well that goes without saying really yeah doesn't it really when you think about it 
[03:03:30]  a little you can leave anger at home you can't leave like you know if it's with you it's it's with  you fair enough it's with you with your thursday that's what i say but um what would you consider  yourself like um almost modern day hippie chick kind of thing um what are you into metal metal yeah but  i mean like like you're do you have any political ideology or you just don't care um  in the middle yeah yeah yeah i would i would guess you as a tree hugger you know like bedwetting 
[03:04:00]  liberal natural foods grocery store oh you do yeah natural organic are you a vegetarian or vegan no  no you like a nice burger you're not as radical people look at you think you're very radical but  yeah i would my first that's why i'm going on first impression your boyfriend has glasses and  he's a kind of a he's a scholarly looking gentleman he's holding his a little nerdy  looking holding his chin in a thoughtful manner which means he probably likes to have things put  in his hiney i respect it is he is is he a good fuck yeah well 1955 glasses is he packing uh yeah yeah 
[03:04:30]  i see a little small fucker with glasses he's probably he's all he's fucking 80 percent cock  you're how much how much taller are you than him um you have to climb on huh yeah about a good four  inches yeah yeah i like that uh i don't want to i don't want to stir the pot or anything but jimmy  was out of the room when we got this uh very important information uh she said she would do  anything for the show for the most part like you know oh no i heard that before i think i heard uh 
[03:05:00]  i i did hear you asking that while you were downstairs oh well this is where i maybe i shouldn't  stir the pot but i would like to tell jimmy this live on the air um you would you would get naked for  us or or at least topless or whatever right yeah yeah uh she's not allowed to get topless in this  studio um yeah we have we have we have a girl an attractive girl if eric logan is uh listening 
[03:05:30]  we're on extra you really gotta get involved here wants to actually yeah pull that that dress off  there and kind of show us but what and i wouldn't mind seeing that at all sir but uh maybe so bold  steve got uh uh uh uh uh steve got a message a message they pretty much dragged him away from what  he was doing to say that there can be no nudity in this studio regardless of the fact that what you 
[03:06:00]  are hearing right now is not and shall not ever be broadcast over cbs airwaves correct this is going  out over xm satellite radio even though we're broadcasting yeah even though we're broadcasting  on xm and we can take any precaution we need we can shut those blinds we can shut that door shut that  door make sure people are at the door so no one can inadvertently walk in and say i didn't expect to  see that now i'm upset and i'm i'm filing suit or something uh that can be taken care of but for some  reason we can't do it can we see you in your because she's very sexy wait wait wait wait so 
[03:06:30]  what happened what happened there steve we can go i was uh called into tom's office i was reminded  twice on my way back into the building after um catching enough you don't listen yeah  well i have i have hearing problems anyway uh yeah exactly um and uh we can go up to almost  naked we like we could put scotch tape or electrical tape over her nipples if we wanted to electrical  tape what are we kidnapping her uh but we cannot expose a hundred percent uh of her full frontal 
[03:07:00]  nudeness this is uh it's it's almost childish almost i mean what is it like what does it go  beyond company policy that's but that's but that's exactly what it is what it's company policy no i've  heard it's not company okay i've heard from a few people that are uh working in the big office that  it's not company okay that cbs does not have a nudity policy if he said it would take nudity 
[03:07:30]  is taken on a case-by-case basis why is this not an acceptable case for it a girl who's a fan of the  show she's of age she's certainly sexy weight wise so if you're over 300 that should be an exception not  made understand there's not going to be anything done there's not going to be a stunt thing done where  someone could be in danger it's the human form the lovely female form and that's it but no  it's some reason what's so weird about this we're still at the the cbs studio obviously yeah tom does 
[03:08:00]  a really good job of trying to wreck our cbs shows and now he's attempting to wreck our xm show as well  that that's insane could i that's absolutely insane where's eric logan get elo on the phone  we ask sarah to be in her underpants and bra is that unacceptable that's acceptable please thank  you tom has tom has no problem taking all the fun out of the other show but now he's going to start  taking the fun out of the xm show that might get it you know what we'll get a head start on it like  jimmy says what head start on it what panties bra and then we'll work we'll work this yeah and negotiate 
[03:08:30]  this yes and i was told the other day that there's no nudity policy with cbs so what the  fuck is going on what is there oh okay there are the cherries they're matching panties and bra  they're black very very good very good i like that yeah look look at that completely comfy the  cherries are all hanging out i was with you with all the other tattoos but the cherries look uh where  like ovaries would be oh is that it's like that's where her ovaries are looks very birthing but i still 
[03:09:00]  think it's why cherries after all these like complicated tattoos you got on your body then you go very  simplistic with the cherries i just thought they were cute yeah yeah i mean they're not bad they're  just uh how long ago did you get the cherries um five years ago five years how old are you 26 when's  the first hat you got which one um i just got it covered up on my back uh oh it was really guy's  name no oh what was it it was girls name tribal oh really that tribal crap right yeah i like the one

[03:13:00]  mind a little bit i see i happen to be totally bald the way i like to say it is between my legs  nah there's gotta be something there to identify the area as what it is you can identify the area  if you're a woman believe me it's it's the part being shoved into your face  with your hands tied and my fucking holding your ears that's the area you'll know the area when it  leaks clear stuff in your eyes it's not hard to fucking distinguish uh kevin from connecticut what's 
[03:13:30]  up hi guys hey four years ago you had a you had a naked woman shooting a bottle rocket out of a snatch  now on xm we can't even see a naked girl this is temporary dude xm doesn't care about the no  xm doesn't give a shit uh tom personally gives a shit because we're getting reports ysp has naked  women in the studio all the fucking time yeah can we can tom tries to say he's a fun person but you  know he takes the fun out of the the the other show we do and now he's attempting to take the fun  out of a show that he has no responsibility in wait can we get except for the fact that we happen 
[03:14:00]  to be broadcasting in the same studio can we ask him because he did say no because then me and him go  at it and then there's you know it's uncomfortable for everybody and then i gotta see him in the hall  and make believe hey we're on the same page yeah you go grab just don't grab bring him in just ask  him if it's a nudity is on a case-by-case basis why won't you allow someone to be topless on the xm  show who's not being touched she's not doing anything but standing there and i was told there's  no policy all right i'll go ask him right now yeah i was told there was no policy 
[03:14:30]  yeah and why do other fucking stations have nudity yeah he doesn't like the nudity and maybe  they've said keep it to a minimum but here's a sexy girl who wants to show her breasts because she  is if i may a good egg yes i believe i said that earlier what you're good that i'm a good egg  because you know something when it comes to the breast it is all about nipple placement yes and as i  look they look wonderful firm oh yeah and stuff yet oh if your nipples were under here they'd be 
[03:15:00]  horrific tits yeah or if they were here they'd be horrific tits but we can we don't know miss and  by the way you're not a 34 sit could you flash real quick no why just real quick yeah yeah all right  good breaking the law breaking the law boo cbs boo yay tits by the way i'm not taking the phone  call after the show oh if tom had a problem with that that was jimmy you called jimmy had a problem 
[03:15:30]  with what with what exactly see the thing is but he'll fit to fake it like you have no idea trust me  you have no idea to fake it like that upsets uh tom because i did it once remember when i said there  was a naked woman in here and there she goes and he came running in and there wasn't even a woman in  the studio call but now you say show tits and uh you know he's gonna think that she really showed him  yeah even if she did good for her yeah maybe she did maybe she didn't i don't know no i don't know 
[03:16:00]  either is there a nudity policy or not oh oh oh who's he on the phone with uh somebody i hope he's on the  phone asking if there's a nudity policy i hope he's not talking to an aunt yeah he's about the  family picnic he's he's a nudist he wants to fourth of july is coming up is there a nudity policy at  the reunion it's hot and my bag looks good i want to be naked we have a nudity policy when you hear 
[03:16:30]  ring ring ring ring banana phone we're gonna have a conversation oh when should that happen  what was your answer who did you just call uh banana phone wouldn't it be funny if someone  going meow meow uh tom's on the phone meow yeah oh quick there's no blanket nudity policy blank and you  can oh we got a girl in here that wants to like uh just take her just take her bra off 
[03:17:00]  tom says we can't who is that i i don't want you don't want to divulge yeah it's over  you're not on the air no it's not me in the background but you're not on the air and i'm  not blowing up your spot they don't know who i call no it's uh so there's no there's no cbs nudity  policy oh yeah right 
[03:17:30]  yep here you go so we've been uh told a falsehood oh really i'm chewing gum yeah yeah swim walk  this is nice obviously if what you wanted a girl just to uh take off her top that would be a pretty  easy thing and stand there and just stand there depending on the nudity we'd have to go through  some some safeguards make sure we're all right that's what i thought i understand that right  we're talking about the most basic uh nudity and we're being told 
[03:18:00]  we're being told we can't do it now he's wrecking this side of the show  see you know you know women are actually able to be topless in certain parts  how is it affecting that side of the show because we're told she can't get naked  because we're in the building but we're on xm exactly  and you know what wait a minute yeah that may actually be an illegal policy  huh that may actually be an illegal policy he's doing because you are is a male allowed to be 
[03:18:30]  newton here or no can a male be topless take your pants off jimmy  if a male can be topless right it has been made illegally a woman has to be able to be topless  uh it was a huge court case decided yes jimmy norton esquire but do you remember that that  happened yes because if a woman it's discrimination yeah look at me like i care what happened uh jimmy's  um testifying i'm making a very valid point to illegally in new york if a man is allowed to 
[03:19:00]  have no shirt on a woman has to be given the same right it was decided in court that was fought in  court and one and why am i looking at a video from kid chris's show thank you whoever found this  that's on youtube anyone could uh check this out yeah it's uh from the kid chris show may 7 2007  i'm looking at three girls uh are they completely naked naked pinata they're doing naked pinata  that's a great idea steal that immediately they have g-strings but now are they um yes but just  dress e-rock as a pinata no no i'm just saying ysp is with cbs the same company that uh we're getting 
[03:19:30]  handcuffed by and and i'm looking at a video where kid chris had nudity in his studio good for kid chris  by that is great look at that they are they are topless they were in little panties but they are  topless and they're smacking around these uh pinatas i don't like that their tits are bobbling and free  that's fantastic tom can't wreck two shows he can't wreck two shows he can't wreck two shows not  two shows you know we've already given up on the other one have a funny bit then tom chiasano starts 
[03:20:00]  cruising oh it's very funny we have to give up on the other show he he doesn't know fun he doesn't  even know uh good ties i'm actually squeezing my shaft looking at this dumb video came up with 10  good bits in the meeting no bits came out tom took the rest this guy's trying to defend tom's fun  factor oh really he's the fun factor of fucking yates trial transcripts come on there was a chuckle 
[03:20:30]  or two i spent as a compliment for tom why did you take that as a negative no no no he's got to stay  out of this crap especially if it's not corporate policy it's simple as that it is as simple as that  but he didn't come to us and go you can get this done see when it comes to nudity what she wants to  do it's like it's like the simplest form of nudity it's not like we're trying it's being nude challenge  or get even we don't even want we're not even trying to get our bottoms off if this was if this was a 
[03:21:00]  photography studio instead of a radio station we would be able to strip her down and take pictures  of her right because we're doing photography it's not anything that would be pornographic or or or  and here's the problem and i've said it to tom instead of trying to figure out ways to do some  of this stuff he just blanket he just says no to everything with no explanation he didn't even come  to us and and say let's try to work this out zero tolerance so so i'm okay with it and you guys 
[03:21:30]  are okay with it it's a girl taking off her stupid top that's it it's not the lamest  don't worry it's just he's mad yeah we are maybe we should do some more safe radio and say woo woo  instead of tush that's the robert klein line i stole really yeah but i mean it's the truth that's the  way it is i like saying asshole does she need to the girl who eric the show the xm show no no not  throw a monkey around tell me it's our intern she hasn't signed anything yet and she's she's 12 
[03:22:00]  and retarded but a good egg you just want to stay out of the xm show even though we're  broadcasting from the cbs studios and we should call eric logan who conveniently is on some kind  of uh freaking uh employee bender today it's an employee what retreat really retreat hope it's  to a treatment facility yeah thanks i'm sure that's so it's going to end with them getting  off a box car and going into the xm gas chambers what's the word the word is he's insane the one 
[03:22:30]  that's peeking is uh oh is tom looking of course he is let me get him can i get a mirror hold it i  don't want to look directly at him i want to look through the bell yes he's there oh he gained some  weight oh no i'm looking through the top of a bell that's steve oh he gained weight and he looks  stupider sorry i'm sorry steve i hate to come on steve uh steve tom says the girl in the video 
[03:23:00]  that you guys saw is uh the girls are wearing pasties yes exactly which this one can wear  pasties we don't want to wear these we don't want to i was just told there's no nudity policy  i love pasties no nudity sounds sexy tom has has sent the email asking for clarification on the nudity  policy he's always been told there was a company policy and that we couldn't have it in the studio  uh-huh yeah but the we part like this is this is uh kind of extenuating circumstances being that  it's not being broadcast this is like being broadcast over a completely different media right 
[03:23:30]  um i understand i i i i know like this is the the building but if we were doing something that  what's the company policy that isn't i don't i don't understand how can you  fucking expect anything but safe radio when you keep giving these fucking pussy directives what if  someone has to go to the bathroom they have to pull their pants down they have to pull their pants  down in the build-up logical argument so if we put her in the bathroom right now can we then take her 
[03:24:00]  can she be nude in the bathroom with duct tape stuff it's it's only going over the air on xm  and nudity is absolutely allowed in bathrooms in this building and i'll even lay under her to make  sure everything absolutely jim we'd have it no other way so what if we all pile in the bathroom  she gets naked in the bathroom it's only over xm it's in the building that is every bathroom in 
[03:24:30]  this entire building is they're allowed to be naked in that's an excellent question i'm gonna go find  it i like throwing monkey wrenches around ask tom say we want to do that because this poor gal is turtling  has nothing to do with broadcasting over anyone's airwaves here it's xm and the irony man they brought  back the rock of new york k-rock where where uh sort of edgy well oh it just stinks you can't get in 
[03:25:00]  trouble with the music this is why we like like exploiting this this is what's wrong with radio  it's just situations like the same guy who go no i'm a fun guy i'm i'm all about fun xm is beautiful  unfortunately right now they're building our studio uh but they could i mean there's certain  things on xm you have to be careful of they drew the line at things in a vagina which could cause an  injury i mean yeah like a fucking renegade lunatic company so no bottle rockets yeah i mean like 
[03:25:30]  for obvious reasons unfortunately being shot in then they think that's kind of silly  but they said that you know nudity is regular nudity is fine lesbians kissing and stuff all  acceptable but uh not not over here it's fucking big a getting a hand job oh that was fantastic  jesus christ dumpster job all right girl's hand  and now we have to uh i i love that steve's got to go to tom and explain can we be in the bathroom  yes can all of us go into the bathroom we want to be in the bathroom with her we all go in the 
[03:26:00]  bathroom with mike hey man you know she might have to go to the bathroom and i who she might be a  freaking need she needs to keep the door open the door has to be open i don't know and the funny thing  is you want to know you want to let me add another piece to this uh this uh this puzzle here jimmy okay  um you know that it's legal for women walking around new york city topless yeah i know yeah you  did while i was on the phone with uh the person yeah the person jimmy cochran was uh okay through 
[03:26:30]  that law yeah you're you're actually allowed a woman um she was just in court for it and she was  able to be topless it's one of those things if guys can do it girls can do it as long as you're not  being lewd or oh god endangering the welfare of a minor things like that did tom just wreck two shows  and one he has no jurisdiction well he's got out he's got jurisdiction because of property is is 
[03:27:00]  how that's being explained because this is the property well we got to find another place to do  the show then until our studio is built what about that balcony wait we're not putting up with this  shit we're not putting up with this shit yeah oh and it'll come in oh you're angst yeah one of our  houses we're gonna do a show from the house well it's just dude you can't my place we're all come  on we're all going you can't these these ridiculous i can see if we were asking for something crazy  but it's let's just turn into a bunch of corporate 
[03:27:30]  pussy world a bunch of corporate pussies for something mild like a pair of breasts man what  the fuck i love how you can say things like fuck her up the ass yet we can't look at a tit  which you can't see over the radio like yeah nothing makes sense kind of like being on the train  you can say things like that but you can't see your tits because she won't kill them  because she's screaming and running from car to car as you follow with a blackjack and piss down  the front of your pants i'll keep going with this you've been a great egg though just standing there 
[03:28:00]  yeah in her panties and bra are you the one that um effed him while your old boyfriend listened  no oh no got uh wrong info so you've been going out three months um what kind of relationship  where are you coming out of dude do you really want to know yes uh oh uh mommy guy  i was supposed to be married in january and i got dumped a week before oh you got dumped by her  yeah for what reason good uh she didn't like your glasses big cock the rest of us i feel like he 
[03:28:30]  sees everything with those things not looking at a lot what uh what happened uh she went crazy  how long were you dating her for five and a half years wow damn dude you're lucky you know how miserable  how old are you 28 all right oh yeah see you 26 year old with tattoos is naked and then how did you  hook up uh we she was one of the bridesmaids what happened sister no um we just met in portland just 
[03:29:00]  yeah yeah hanging around doing heroin pretty much off yeah yeah cool and then uh what about you what  what were you coming off of um an alcoholic coke head all right yeah that's what your boyfriend was  yeah did he slap you around a little um i liked it holy all right so you you kind of like uh the  basic ass spanking or do you like being slapped like maybe in the face i don't like it in the face no 
[03:29:30]  you don't like it in the face on the ass yeah what about like uh give you a charley horse something like  that no that hurts leaves a bruise yeah nowhere else just your ass um yeah yeah all right uh steve's  back oh steve steve is uh our liaison by the way more reports coming in barski showdown in philly on  wysp uh does like the booby uh art thing yeah porn stars doing you know boob uh boob art okay once 
[03:30:00]  again yeah uh he's saying that you can go get him a list of all the other jocks and all the other cbs  markets and uh have them debate this and he'll tell you that you're looking at girls with pasties  on well and not uh fully nude but that's fine that's fine but we're saying yes radio i i heard  from a corporate guy you guys heard me in the background that there is no nudity policy and  he's saying there is a nudity policy and until he hears different uh then uh uh why do guys stay in  radio i don't get it if it's not something like you have a love for why stay obviously he's a guy who 
[03:30:30]  knows a tremendous amount about i mean you gotta be honest he's one of the you know well his ideology  would be he does have a love for it and he wants to stay and uh that's why he's he's uh taking the  safe road because we have tendency to get our bosses fired yeah but now i'm not talking about just do  whatever you want and say the company but why not fight for something like why not say like this is  wrong it helps the whole vibe of the show yeah it does help things and when we had the the the gigantic 
[03:31:00]  numbers here and all these great things when we were on the free fm side all all of this stuff was  allowed language wise and then we bitch at these guys or we wonder why these guys can't do certain  things when we have cut their balls in a talk format you can't totally emasculate a show i know and  expect it to do edgy radio you really can't especially you guys got to adjust you can't adjust beyond  certain things do you understand you can't have any racial content they dumped bob kelly on cbs  saying uh i make fun of asian people in my act there was nothing mean about it no do an asian 
[03:31:30]  voice he said i make fun of asian and they dumped him yeah how do you how do you compete with smaller  market shows who don't have bullseyes on their head that can make masturbation songs and do all  this very hard and we're here like a bunch of faggots going can we see you with a pasty on that's what we  should do can we suck each other's dicks in the men's room tee hee tee hee we're edgy i meant there's a real  question can we all upset i'll make everyone happy i don't uh get it oh yeah oh my god what is 
[03:32:00]  that rude show uh that i'm seeing on there there's all kinds of hijinks and debauchery going on see  that was a lot oh that's our old new show oh no this is another bit on ysp where a stripper's grinding  her ass on another girl's uh uh twat we're not allowed to do that i think that the holy spirit has to  have room because that would be fun i like fun with a capital block 
[03:32:30]  oh he got really mad when i said yeah on shore because it was sure nobody wants to admit that  their idea of fun is no longer what uh is you know considered cool nobody wants to admit like yes my  idea of fun is sipping a lemonade and watching the fucking meet the press yeah nobody wants to admit  that's their idea can we actually do things find some some girls with uh their bra and panties on  but to do unspeakable things let's like they're they're fully clothed but like they're eating each 
[03:33:00]  other's ass yes like really is that possible let's do it i want women that have their they can they have  like boy shorts or bra and panties on they're clothed don't worry no nudity but they're rolling  around kissing each other and maybe slipping a little tongue up the asshole every uh every roll or  two yeah through the cloth through the cloth there's no nothing being exposed they're they're uh uh you 
[03:33:30]  know kind of gumming gumming sorry gumming each other's pussy through the panties they gum it a little bit  i think that'd be fun can i go to watch and then for girls like like you like being spanked or stuff  like that there are girls that like being hit a little bit girls in their bra and panties and they  can just whale each other with like baseball bats what turned your own mic off i might as well i might  as well don't be mad at you might as well no who wants to hear angst right tom uh should we spank her 
[03:34:00]  through her panties at least i see in front of uh the dweeb the boyfriend i mean the boyfriend i'm  sorry that's okay i'm taking my anger out on you it's fair i'm actually nice it's fair he said what's  that the story of a bunch of sorry visual joke even here yes oh are you got an update steve what's

[03:39:00]  answer is uh all right i'm gonna say he said don't worry about the underpants she could suck his dick  right here he said ah shit you must have cameras he said yes as long as we uh put down the blinds  wow all right i don't need to be here um no he said uh constitutes a sex act and no  constitutes a sex act in what county no it doesn't in what county so is that a lap dance  in what county is that a sex act i like the dweeb now this guy's all right we're asking about now 
[03:39:30]  because i asked specifically about you know like uh uh gumming gumming uh gumming through the pants  and the fully clothed ass eating anything that is uh mouth to anus contact yeah but it wouldn't be  exactly and that was my argument he said no it's still a sex act can we have two women uh wearing  nun outfits hold oranges and go whoopsie daisy or is that too edgy yeah whoopsie daisy two women 
[03:40:00]  holding oranges and going whoopsie daisy i really don't get this i do you know exactly what i get it  you know exactly what i don't get it i get it to a t you know exactly what this shit is  i get it to a t yeah i don't get it hey man if butcher and rich at bcn have  naked topless in studio pics of playboy crystal on their website

[03:41:00]  that be a sex act and then if he had his underwear on and she had her panties on is it a sex act and  then if she starts gyrating is that then a sex act when does it become a sex act when when there is an  actual sex happening at all a lap dance in their underwear why can't we do that can you ask him right  now underwear steve underwear lap dance if she's sitting on his dick does that constitute anal sex  yeah according to the mouth on the deck that it does right so let's call up and find out because 
[03:41:30]  if that's the case i've fucked a lot of pretty girls on the ass for 20 bucks during a three-minute song  okay okay please let's do this steve is off again he's getting his workout ask his question yeah steve's  exercising and you know he's sucking up to tom when he gets there look like the guy sent me back  they said tom i'm so sorry i didn't mean to like two adults mediating children yeah  i'm listening to the show in the other i know i figured of course i can hear you who's listening 
[03:42:00]  in the other room where is he steve just left oh yeah steve's going to now ask i'll slap steve in  the face about that i hope he's beyond the other room um oh i don't think that's true what someone's  saying tom still has uh howard's pubes in his braces that uh come on now i mean back in the  day when they get serious say virtually anything yeah and have naked girls all the time and 
[03:42:30]  fucking porn stars to give out their websites oh times have changed yeah to do shit yeah i know  but do they have to change that much i mean times have changed but jesus this is like going from  fucking 15th century christianity to to fucking club pagan in jamaica is that even a club i don't  know i was trying and failing wouldn't shouldn't have gone the other way though club pagan first 15  centuries i was only being specific with differences yeah clearly which way one was going see that's why  i'm not a good comedian neither am i i fucked it up i'm too uh sexy yeah well built yep too too veed in 
[03:43:00]  the lower abdomen yep keep going i can't think of any more oh please no  well way to stop the show and way to stop a show that you should have no control most people just  have no fucking balls and there's a difference between having some kind of balls and being edgy but  just no balls man it's like fucking yeah i just uh no one why don't you what 
[03:43:30]  why don't you just show xm the difference between satellite radio and regular radio that's really  smart do you know that's so smart despite the troubles of this show with the condoleezer ice  thing and all that xm said look i mean uh refused and this is the truth to give any specific things  that could not be said absolutely refused would not do it so we cannot tell you what not to say  i'm secretly working for howard you think it's starting to wonder they did have a relationship 
[03:44:00]  of over 20 years it's kind of hard to uh you know maybe there's something going on  you mean like look into that send the investigators on that one  but she's still standing there in her undies seriously i don't get it either  seriously and like uh xm is just a good example of people that say they're not gonna 
[03:44:30]  just tie you up and they don't tie you up i mean i mean it  we're not gonna tell you you can't say something or have nudity  i'm just reading um pal talk comments they're not very happy they're beating me up they shouldn't be  no they're not very happy with the situation why don't we do line of the day and get out of this  shithole well steve will be back soon what then we could set up line of the day while we're  yeah getting waiting for steve let's wait till he skips back

[03:45:30]  good news really underwear lap dance is sure but who the fuck wants to do that no no but i want to  know how does that not constitute a sex act how how did you how did you explain this to him how does that  not cost in his eyes it doesn't constitute a sex act if i get an erection is it a sex act what's that if  i get an erection is it a sex act ah then it probably yeah what did you want me to talk him  out of it no no then you know the underwear slips away and a dick might slip somewhere no no jim's 
[03:46:00]  mouth whoa whoa whoa do you have boxers yeah all right you're correct okay no the thing is steve what  i was saying is like obviously the lap dance the lighter didn't allow that but when does it become a  sex act like what like you said what constitutes yeah i don't i honestly don't understand the logic  either what did he say doesn't he didn't say anything it just doesn't like one constitutes  a sex act one does it one one was oral genital contact and one was how about this clothing clothing  content like a lap dance can she rub her face on his penis no because strippers do that no mouth 
[03:46:30]  just face strippers do that yeah but they'd say they'd say no to that i mean i would bet you that  just based on the previous answers that i got he'd say no to that how about this can she sit here on  this can he sit here on the sofa in his underpants and can she lay on his lap like they're watching  television together does her face have to be away from his balls and penis i'm serious i mean if they  want to be so fucking bullshit nitpicky where does the line start it's both there yeah you know it's 
[03:47:00]  nonsense yeah it is not i i i i'm gonna ride right now i'm thinking of you how about we just sit around  and bake an apple pie oh what are you crazy that's gonna be a problem the hot apples to get on someone  absolutely not what if someone choked on an apple  plus there might be sponsorship here by pumpkin pie we can't offend them by promoting apple pie
