<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a range of topics, primarily revolving around Michael Richards' racist tirade at the Laugh Factory and a controversial "facial" given to a woman nicknamed "Stalker Patty."  The show opened with a bizarre studio segment where a staff member, Danny, received a severely botched haircut from another guest, Sam. This was followed by an uncensored airing of Michael Richards' rant, filled with repeated use of the n-word and other racial slurs.  The hosts then interviewed Jamie Masada, owner of the Laugh Factory, who recounted the incident and the audience's reaction.  Comedian Paul Mooney called in, discussing Richards' emotional breakdown and the complexities of race in comedy.  Paul Rodriguez also participated, offering his perspective on Richards' actions and the subsequent fallout.  Rodriguez also discussed receiving arson and death threats, his upcoming TV work, and past performances at the Laugh Factory in Times Square, vividly describing the club's unique and slightly unsettling atmosphere.  The conversation with Rodriguez included tangents about the building's history, rife with humorous and crude jokes.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to discussing the fallout from Richards' tirade.  Sinbad, who was present at the Laugh Factory during the incident, called in, describing Richards' outburst as excessive and unprovoked.  He, along with the hosts, debated the double standard regarding the use of racial slurs by comedians of different races.  Patrice O'Neal also called, offering a provocative perspective, criticizing Richards' apology as worse than the original offense and arguing that the N-word's power was diminished within the black community.  He engaged in several extended and humorous exchanges with the hosts and Jim Norton about race, comedy, and the double standard.  Portions of Richards’ apology on David Letterman’s show were played and dissected by the hosts and O'Neal.  The hosts also discussed the media's censorship of the racial slur, contrasting their ability to discuss it freely on XM radio with terrestrial broadcast restrictions.

Another major thread throughout the broadcast centered on the "Stalker Patty facial" video.  This segment involved the hosts and Jim Norton applying a homemade facial mask to Stalker Patty, culminating in a slap.  The show featured discussions about listener reaction to the video, a technical error that prevented its airing on XM radio earlier, and its subsequent release on YouTube and their website. Danny, a staff member, was ultimately punished for the technical error by having a stripe of hair shaved into his head.  The hosts repeatedly promoted the video throughout the show.

Other segments included listener calls, tangents on unrelated topics like a Nazi-themed gingerbread display, discussions about Patrice O'Neal's departure from Web Junk and racially charged jokes about gentrification in Harlem, speculation about O.J. Simpson's potential to share his account of the murders online after his book deal was cancelled, a segment on the "most dangerous toys" of 2006, and promotion of an upcoming eggnog challenge and the show’s "Whip Them Out Wednesday" segment.  The show frequently employed highly offensive language and discussed offensive topics throughout.  A listener who sent them blueberries was also a recurring gag throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  The consequences of a killer epidemic.  One goes in, millions come out. Every cell is dead.  Don't mess with this stuff.  Okay, sirs, here we go.  What is the virus?  In the space of an hour, a single virus has invaded, multiplied and killed the cell.  Continually multiplying, searching for the next vector until there's nothing left to kill.  The answer to infection.  There is no answer to infection. It's already done pretty much all the damage it can. 
[00:00:30]  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  And then eventually, everything just stops.  The virus is spreading.  If this doesn't make you want to throw up for failures.  The most annoying thing on two legs.  What a bore fest.  Who cares about the funny?  Just bring me the porn.  Aren't we dumb?  He he he.  Opie.  Oh, do you want to play?  Anthony.  I will beat children about the head.  Jim Norton. 
[00:01:00]  I'm dancing. I'm dancing.  I'm just, I'm a naked whore.  It's indescribable. I'm trying.  It's like a rape that's covered by insurance.  Some of the comments they make are uncalled for.  Why are you crying?  The virus finally hit him.  But with Jimmy, you never know. It could be AIDS.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus that spreads from town to town across the U.S. today.  And. 
[00:01:30]  I hate you.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The O and A virus spreading across America.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Wake up.  Phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  That's 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:02:00]  A lot of chatter.  A lot of chatter going on.  Chatter?  The faithful listeners are chattering behind the scenes.  What a boop.  And I say that for our Canadian friends.  What are they shouting a boop?  Well, we pretty much do two radio shows a day.  Two completely different radio shows a day for two different companies.  So if you don't have XM, this isn't going to make much sense. 
[00:02:30]  But on XM, we get to do replays all day long because we have our own channel.  Yep.  So, like, if you don't hear the show in the morning, you can catch one of the replays and listen to some of the stuff you missed during the show.  Right.  And over at XM, where we get a little dirtier.  Oh, we get dirty.  Hotty mouths.  We filmed a video with Stalker Patty.  It wasn't really that dirty.  We gave her a facial.  You're allowed to say that over here. 
[00:03:00]  We gave her a facial.  Yeah.  With all organic things.  With products like egg whites and yogurt.  We took egg whites.  A couple of people really went all out and put together a nice formula.  Yeah.  That I think is probably good for the skin.  It was egg whites mixed with some mayonnaise.  And then a little bit of, like, flour, I guess.  Yes, sir. 
[00:03:30]  And then it had a nice, thick, yet runny consistency.  Nice pale color to it.  Wonderful.  Let's put it this way.  Stalker Patty has a nice glow today.  Nice glow.  She wouldn't get a better facial from one of these joints in Manhattan.  No.  So we gave her a nice facial yesterday, and it was some fine, fine radio.  And then Jimmy did something to Stalker Patty that you just flat out can't do on regular radio. 
[00:04:00]  But the sound was beyond hilarious, Jimmy.  It's a very unique sound.  It was like.  Yeah, it was.  Just hit her cheek a little bit.  Yeah.  So.  Yeah, he slapped her cheek.  That's why we call it the ONA virus, by the way.  We do these type of things on our show, and then it creates chatter.  Is it a slap or was it a tap?  I think it's more a tap.  No, it was a slap.  He tapped her cheek. 
[00:04:30]  Well, you think it was a slap?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He hauled off and slapped as best he could.  Well, it's kind of hard to slap.  You know.  That's kind of hard.  No, it was definitely more than a tap.  Okay.  Yeah.  I think normally it would be considered a tap.  But I'm very amazed that you were actually able to slap her like that.  I'm not.  Why are you amazed? 
[00:05:00]  He's done that a million times.  That's the point.  He's an expert.  Well, never on the radio.  Yeah.  As soon as I saw him do that, I'm like, oh, God, he's done this before.  A few times.  I like how he positioned her head like he was taking her picture.  Okay.  Now tilt your head to the side.  And she tilted.  All right.  No, you've got to get lower.  Get lower.  All right.  Now tilt your head.  And then you just heard.  Pow.  Anyway.  It was hard, let's say, in the way things were to do that. 
[00:05:30]  It would have been much easier if, say, Patty was a beautiful girl.  If you were standing at the plate.  Right.  And you want to get a base hit.  Much easier to do it with a bat than it would be with a piece of licorice.  There you go.  Sure.  Enough.  Good baseball talk.  It's our sports break.  So, hence the term, the O&A virus, because we do these type of things.  And then it creates chatter.  People are like, did you hear the Opie and Anthony show?  And someone will go, no, I didn't.  Tell me what happened.  And then you tell them what happened.  And then they become hooked on the show. 
[00:06:00]  And then they pass it on to somebody else.  It's always been the way with this program.  So, we did some fine radio all day long yesterday, but especially over at XM for once, because  usually we just call in the XM show.  But yesterday we decided to do an actual show for the XMers.  And so, it created all this chatter.  So, a lot of people that didn't hear it, you know, when we did it live, couldn't wait for  the replay.  Couldn't wait.  Oh, my God.  My buddy called me.  And I was getting IMs and text messages.  You got to listen to Opie and Anthony Tay to see what Jimmy did to Stalker Patty and 
[00:06:30]  then what the boys did to Stalker Patty.  Something to do with a facial.  Eager anticipation.  The message board had the thread up.  Yeah.  The listening thread up.  They were all ready to chat about it.  Yeah.  They were chatting and chatting.  And now they just needed, you know, the people that didn't hear just needed to hear it  on the replay.  So, fast forward, I'm sitting home around, what time was that?  About 6.30, Ant?  Somewhere around there, maybe?  Let's call it 6.30. 
[00:07:00]  All right, let's.  All of a sudden, my email goes crazy.  My phone is ringing off the hook.  My Blackberry Olsen has a million emails.  Smoke signals.  Oh, getting text messages.  And people are knocking on my door.  I mean, it just got out of hand.  Any other forms of communication.  And then I'm like, yeah, exactly.  The telegraph was beeping off the wire.  And then me being the smart guy, I was like, I think something's going on.  Must be something.  I think something's up because I never get this many phone calls this time of night. 
[00:07:30]  So, I check and all hell broke loose.  They didn't replay the stalker Patty facial over at XM yesterday.  Why?  And within seconds.  Oh, you don't know this yet, Jimmy?  What happened?  That ass calling.  Within seconds.  So, I call.  And within seconds, the message boards start going, you know, they cut it out because it's  too dirty and this and that.  So, I had to get on there and chastise them again.  I just put a big, relax. 
[00:08:00]  You'd have been so proud.  But I used probably 50 exclamation points in a row.  The time is necessary.  And following all caps.  Oh, boy.  Because you were shouting, though.  I was shouting.  I had to be heard.  So, calls went out to Don at XM and our producer there, Steve and Finn.  I mean, anyone I could get a hold of.  And finally, after some investigating, our own Danny effed up.  It was a technical glitch caused by Danny who... 
[00:08:30]  He didn't code the segment right or whatever.  Apparently, if you...  Yeah, it's not like regular radio where you just babble and turn the mics on or run some  kind of friggin' tape or DVD or CD or something.  You have to put in the proper launch code for whatever segment has to be played in whatever  order.  Right.  And apparently, the wrong code was put in.  And I said to Hope last night, I'm like, these things should be gone over like launch 
[00:09:00]  codes in a bomber where somebody, you know, you break open the little piece of plastic  and AE663512, confirm.  Confirmed.  Yeah, you know, that turn your key, sir.  But apparently, a couple of numbers got screwed up, I guess, and the system doesn't identify  it and defaults to playing what was played the previous day at the same time, I guess. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, something like that.  Some kind of wacky little safety system.  So, out of all the segments to screw up, that was not the one to screw up with yesterday.  That was the one that didn't get played yesterday.  Yeah, which is a real, real bummer.  And then, here's dumb Danny right here.  Danny.  Hi.  Hi.  So, what happened yesterday?  Well, when I was cutting up the replay, like I usually do, I ended up getting ahead of  myself and I miscalculated where I was in the replay. 
[00:10:00]  Getting ahead of yourself, what, in shots?  No, no, no.  I was running around doing a bunch of stuff and I thought I had actually done that segment,  so I moved on to the next one, when in turn I didn't.  Oh.  The replay came around, it replayed last week's Monday segment.  Yeah.  Which was a bummer for everybody.  So many people are pissed at you today.  They were all waiting, Danny.  They're mad at you.  Danny is the one.  You, Danny, were the one.  Everyone was speculating it was Bill, but it was Danny.  It was Danny. 
[00:10:30]  We get to blame today.  I am very sorry, fellas.  Hey, Danny, how nervous were you to call me last night?  I was freaking out.  It's not a fun call to make.  I'm thinking the same thing.  I'm like, oh, crap.  I'm like, of all the days, of all the segments, it was that one.  You know, Murphy's Law, so I figured I didn't want to just shoot off an email.  I figured this was important enough that I needed to call the boss.  What made you think of Murphy's Law?  Is that the funny poster you have hanging up on the bathroom door?  You just keep pushing the right comedy moves. 
[00:11:00]  Murphy's Law, hey.  If it can go wrong, will go wrong.  Yep.  Yeah.  Danny's in charge of it.  I realize that at times people are scared of me because Danny called me yesterday.  Hope he tries to rule with fear.  What?  I said, because I got the panicky call from Steve.  You know, I had no idea what was going on at the time, so he called me and informs me of what's going on.  He's like, dude, you better get on the phone without. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  Well, Steve is an overreacting ass at times.  Did he call you?  Yeah.  Me and Steve talked.  I talked to Don.  Steve's an overreacting ass.  Steve's been around.  Yeah.  Steve knew.  He's seen.  It could go either way with the phone call.  So Danny explains to me what happens, and I let him off the hook, and I pardon him.  I pardon you.  And all of a sudden, this is.  I shot him as he was running down the street.  I swear to God, this is what I heard on the other end of the phone.  Oh.  Like, there's a huge sigh of relief. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  I hate to let you in on this, Ope, but we don't even like calling you when it's good news.  All right.  All right.  I'm changing my tune slowly but surely.  Right, Danny?  I was all right last night.  Give me some credit.  I was really expecting to have my ass chewed out.  And honestly, we were all bummed, but we'll make good today somehow on XM.  We'll replay that segment a couple times.  Yeah.  All right, Danny.  Thanks, man.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Thanks for wrecking things. 
[00:12:30]  There goes Danny.  And what he doesn't know is really, there goes Danny.  We fired him.  He just doesn't know yet.  He doesn't know yet.  Take care, Danny Cancer.  But the video for this side of the show, because they have no idea what we did yesterday, we  gave Stalker Patty a facial.  A facial.  The video is up on opieandanthony.com.  It's a stunning simulation of something people might see on certain dirty websites. 
[00:13:00]  With a comedy twist.  Right.  Comedy twist.  Dare I say it?  A comedy twist.  Dare.  Dare.  Because it is so goddamn funny.  I watched it about five times last night.  I got you beat.  Up to like ten times.  Every time I laughed at the sheer quantity of garbage being dumped on her face.  It is really funny.  There's just too much stuff pouring onto her face.  Yeah.  And then it just turns ridiculous. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Well, there's the comedy twist.  Yeah.  So the video's up on opieandanthony.com.  O-P-I-E, by the way.  People spell my name wrong for, I don't know why.  Opie.  Opie, whatever.  Stop it with the opie.  And do us a favor and watch the YouTube version because we're whores and we want to get our views way up and get some honors today on YouTube, okay?  Right.  And there's some virus spreaders out there.  Those people, you know who you are.  Pass it on to your friends.  Let's get that video out there a bit today, okay? 
[00:14:00]  Opieandanthony.com.  It's Stalker Patty getting a facial.  It's really, really funny.  And for the XMers, we will replay that bit today later on.  Yeah.  Later on this morning and all day long on our channel, okay?  All day long.  I got a little something for Jimmy before we go to break.  Good, because I'm very disturbed today.  Ready?  Yeah.  Oh, I can barely, okay.  Oh, I can barely hear it.  Okay, hold on. 
[00:14:30]  It's so quiet.  Shh.  Okay.  Wow, this is almost impossible to hear.  Here you go, folks.  That's, it sounds like a record skipping.  A little slap.  Here you go.  I think we can play this, too.  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Are you ready?  Yeah.  Put your face down a little bit.  Tilt it this way.  I don't hear your glasses.  Tilt it this way.  Like that.  Okay.  Okay. 
[00:15:00]  It's actually easier when you have talking before it.  Yeah, yeah.  What is wrong with you?  If I was Fred before, I'm right now.  Yeah, I'm right now.  Right now.  All right.  I'm right before.  And the next bit of controversy we'll talk about after the break.  Ah, nice.  We'll show you how ridiculous regular radio has become.  We love being back on regular radio. 
[00:15:30]  I'm not going to lie to you.  But it's so ridiculous.  But there are certain aspects of it that are a bit frustrating.  Everyone is talking about this Kramer thing today.  Everybody.  Everybody.  The Daily News has KKK Raymer.  KKK Kramer, right?  Yeah, it's KKK Raymer.  Right.  Like he's in the Klan.  But see, the company we work for, we're not allowed to say the N-word over here.  Yeah, they're very.  It has nothing to do with the FCC, by the way. 
[00:16:00]  Very, very nervous about that word being used in any context, even if it's to report a story that everybody's talking about.  It's not used as a hateful speech.  It's just it's reporting what was said, what everyone knows.  Everyone knows the word that was used.  Everyone knows everything.  But, you know, in order to play the clip and then maybe do a little comedy, a little fun with it, taboo.  And the thing that's annoying is I guarantee you black hosts. 
[00:16:30]  And, again, we've talked about not being allowed to say the N-word.  Most times you don't need it.  But in this case, it's legitimate to really need it to, you know.  Yeah, you really need it to make the impact of the story.  You're like a child saying N-word.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a real thing, and it really happened.  And if it was a black host, they would allow it.  This is purely a corporate thing, and it's not the FCC.  Yeah, I got a message to Joel Hollander.  You've got to push back with these lawyers.  You've got to push back with these lawyers or you're going to get your – the business  is going to be ruined.  Your own lawyers are effing up talk radio.  They're dooming it.  You want a show like ours that are going to talk about the topics of the day. 
[00:17:00]  This is one of the biggest stories.  It's the lead story on all the morning shows this morning.  It almost made the front page of the New York Papers.  It's on page three.  You've got to push back with the lawyers.  I'm telling you.  Don't worry.  We're not doing stuff that the FCC is going to swoop in and fine and take away license  for.  It's not anything about that.  It's your own lawyers that have just castrated talk radio.  And you've allowed it.  Yeah.  Believe me, if it was Kike or if it was any other – Dago, WAP, anything else, Mick, 
[00:17:30]  you'd allow us to talk about it and do anything.  But because it's nigger, we can't say it because that's terrible.  Guaranteed, it's gone.  Yes.  Yeah, they just dumped out of you.  Of course they did.  You know, Joel, you've got to wake up, man.  I'm telling you.  There's all sorts of competition out there.  And you want a talk show that's going to talk about the issues of the day.  Here's a huge story.  And your top show, we can't use the word.  Yeah, not allowed.  You know how ridiculous that is? 
[00:18:00]  We have to report it like Good Morning America.  Why would you listen to this show when you can go to Good Morning America and here's the  same stupid coverage?  Yeah, and they give it a little disclaimer.  What you might be hearing might offend you.  The language in the next segment might offend some people, so please, you know – and then  they can play it.  Satellite radio is creeping up and there's a reason for it.  You know, later on this morning, we're going to do the same exact story and trust me,  and we're going to have no rules.  We're going to have no rules over there. 
[00:18:30]  I bet that got dumped, too.  We're going to have no corporate rules.  Yeah, it's happened before.  Huh?  Are you kidding?  No, I'm not kidding.  They would dump that if we said that?  They better.  Yeah, yeah.  I bet they'd –  They better not.  It's a message.  They've got to get the message.  It's a huge story.  We should be allowed to talk about it.  And then we've got some kind of rules where, like, if Patrice is in studio because he's  black, he could say maybe once, maybe twice.  Yeah, it's a weird double standard based on nothing but lawyers in a room somewhere. 
[00:19:00]  What the hell?  The advertisers are not going to leave.  Huh?  The advertisers are not going to leave.  Not under that circumstance.  No.  It's not under –  It's not like we're going on the show today and we just feel like saying the word over  and over again and doing, you know, maybe just, you know, off-color jokes about it or  something.  We're – you know, we're discussing it.  Discussing a huge story.  Or if you're saying it in anger, like if a caller calls up and you're firing at him  angrily, that's different.  It's a different intent and everybody knows it's different.  All right, well –  That's what the lawyers – you're just garbage. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, it's like –  Just garbage.  They take one circumstance that might come up, like Jimmy just said.  Some guy calls up and you get pissed at him and you just throw the word out, which,  you know, we wouldn't do.  Would not do.  But the lawyers see that and say, all right, since that might happen, ban the word from  ever being used.  Ever.  In any context.  And it's like, oh, come on already.  Which, by the way, gives the word so much more power.  Nah.  Why are you powering these words?  They're just words in the end. 
[00:20:00]  I don't even care if we talk about it over here.  We'd be able to be funny with it on XM.  Some things you can't do on Terrestrial.  All right, why don't we – we'll take a break.  We'll get into it.  Kramer did apologize on Letterman last night.  There's –  That's why I'm –  Anthony stayed up and watched.  Yeah, very, very tired today.  I could not resist watching.  And, oh, my God, it was uncomfortable.  All right, we'll get into the whole controversy next.  By the way, I bet you that they'll say N-word on TV.  I bet you that they will –  They will.  They're bleeping it.  They won't even write it.  I'm watching TV right now.  He's an N-star, star, star, star, star. 
[00:20:30]  Star, star, star, star, star, star.  Star, star, star, star, star.  Wait.  He's a navigator.  N-star, star, star, star, star.  N-star, double G, star, star.  No.  No.  You can't do that.  There was a murder committed in Iraq.  Chappaqua.  Which didn't really bother me.  Oh, the comic?  Really, really.  All right, we'll get into that, too.  Everything that is wrong with us.  We got a lot to do.  Also, the top ten worst toys this holiday season. 
[00:21:00]  Number one, of course, the talking Kramer doll.  Talking Kramer doll?  Yeah, yeah.  That one.  You want to make sure you don't get that one.  You want to make sure you don't get that one for your kids.  Yikes.  This holiday season.  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, and the comedians of the Opie and Anthony show are appearing in a special holiday edition of FHM on sale now.  E-Rock's creepy photos from the FHM shooter now online at opieandanthony.com.

It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The virus is spreading.  Opie and Anthony!  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM 202.  Opie and Anthony!  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:22:00]  Ten days and counting.  Eggnog drinking contest.  Three.  Ten days?  Ten days and counting.  Wow.  Week from Friday, Anthony.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE.  We're fired up this morning.  Fired up!  This Kramer thing is getting out of hand.  Well, it's very hard to report.  But, uh, yeah, other, other, uh, uh, the, the TV news stations, uh, are using transcripts. 
[00:22:30]  And then, uh, like Jimmy saw before, it says N, star, star, star, star, star, star.  Did I get the right amount of stars?  One more?  Uh, and star, star, star, star, star, star.  Got to say the N word.  You know what?  We were, we were, we were saying, could we go to maybe the N-I word?  Can you say the N-I word?  Just so no one confuses it with, like, navigator or, you know, something like that. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, everyone else says the N word.  We're going to say the N-I word.  The N-I word.  That way at least you, you're a little, you got a little more knowledge there, a little  more input, and you might actually know what we're talking about.  Can you say the N-I-G dot dot dot dot dot word?  No, I bet, I bet not.  Why not?  That could be night.  Could be nightcrawler.  It could.  In some cases it is.  I don't think Kramer was yelling at a guy in a suit of armor, though. 
[00:23:30]  He wasn't yelling at a worm.  Trying to do some fishing.  So, where do we begin with this?  Everyone knows the story by now, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Mr. Richards there hasn't done much since Seinfeld.  Season 7, by the way, available on DVD, just in time for the holiday.  Just in time for all this hoopla.  You know, I got a thought about this.  Jerry told Kramer to create some controversy to help the sales of the Season 7 DVD. 
[00:24:00]  DVD, you know, you read message boards and blogs.  There are people that actually believe that this is all a staged thing between, you know,  the Seinfeld cast to sell more of the just released Season 7 DVDs.  Well, what happened is the Seinfeld cast was going to fake a plane crash into the Pentagon,  and when they couldn't pull that off, they decided to do this because you have to get some kind of a buzz going. 
[00:24:30]  These idiots out there, they just want something to be happening beyond what they can see.  Kramer, call people.  Kramer, call people.  Who are these?  And, uh, Elaine, you go after the.  And, uh, I'm going to go after the.  And Kramer, Kramer, go after the.  We've got to boost sales of the DVDs. 
[00:25:00]  Got to boost sales.  How did Season 6 sell?  Go after the.  I like the trail off.  Making the bid.  Let's say hi to Tony in Pennsylvania.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, boys, what's going on?  Hey, Tony.  Hey, I saw that video last night.  I just wanted to ask Jim, uh, being that he's a comic, like, what happened on stage there?  Was he, was he trying for a joke and he got flustered? 
[00:25:30]  What do you think happened?  I don't know.  Um, first of all, every comic has wanted to yell that out of an audience member at one point.  It's the most hurtful, awful thing you can do.  It's a woman you want to drop the C-bomb.  Um, no matter what's going on as a comedian, there are times where you just want to hurt an audience member.  And I worked the Laugh Factory in L.A.  It's, it's.  It's a tough room, Jimmy, huh?  I mean, it's the type of room you can murder in.  You can really kill.  It's built to destroy it.  I mean, it's a, it's a good, a club to perform in, but the crowds don't typically like me.  You gotta explain, though, it has a balcony, which is very, very rare for a comedy club. 
[00:26:00]  You have the audience in front of you, and then there's a balcony up.  And you can see Richards was looking up to the left and yelling into the balcony.  I believe that's where the heckler was.  It just seemed like he had nothing.  Well, I don't know what was going on, though.  What was the guy yelling?  Was the guy saying the N-word himself?  There were black guys.  Was the guy going, yo, I, you know, yo, man, this, this nigga ain't funny.  He, I said it, get dumped.  There's nothing I can do about it.  Or was the guy saying something like, yo, white boy, you're not funny.  Was the guy being racial at all either against Michael Richards, or was the guy just being a douche and Richard snapped? 
[00:26:30]  I don't know.  Yeah, it seemed at first that Richards was trying to be profound with the whole it's-just-a-word-man thing.  But then it just turned into what seemed to be just yelling a racial epithet at somebody.  Did he use the word during his act or when he got flustered and people started heckling him, and then that's how he fought back?  I don't know.  I don't know, because we don't know what the beginning of the tape was. 
[00:27:00]  Well, we've got to get Jamie on the phone.  We've got the owner of Laugh Factory calling the show today.  He also owns the Laugh Factory here in New York.  I didn't know where it was at first.  I'm like, oh, yeah, Michael Richards is in L.A.  Jamie Masada, who is-he was kind of in the Michael Jackson case, too.  He introduced the kid to Michael.  He did some weird thing.  I don't know how Jamie gets that Laugh Factory sign-up, but, man, he's a marketing dude.  Have you ever seen Michael Richards perform?  No.  He was supposed to do-I was doing the improv one night, and he was supposed to come in, and for whatever reason, he canceled the last minute. 
[00:27:30]  So I've never seen him on stage.  We'll get the owner of the-  To the end of the meeting.  To the end of the meeting.  Yeah.  We'll get the owner of the Laugh Factory on at 730 today.  Okay.  Jamie.  Jamie will be calling the show.  Well, here, I mean, you know, here's the actual set.  It's only a couple minutes.  We've got two parts here.  Yeah, it's going to be bleeped to crap because, you know, lawyers know what makes good radio.  Yeah, they do.  Just keep listening to the lawyers.  Oh, what is that about?  This is a display in a store window that was stopped.  It's some kind of Nazi gingerbread display at a hardware store that had to be taken down. 
[00:28:00]  Just incredible.  Why would anyone have a Nazi gingerbread display?  I don't know.  Apparently, this guy is one of these, like, artistic people and does controversial art.  So he made a gingerbread village that looked like Hitler at Nuremberg giving his speeches.  It's just brilliant.  Complete with Nazi flags and everything.  How do you think that's going to be received?  You know what?  But I'm so-  But it's gingerbread.  They're so delicious.  No, they're not. 
[00:28:30]  Gingerbread stinks.  I love gingerbread, man.  You take that back.  No.  You don't like ginger snaps?  No, it's the G word.  No, the G word.  They look adorable, but they taste like crap.  Look at that.  It's on this TV now.  It's Stig Heilig.  There it is.  Yeah.  It looks like Cartman as Hitler.  Yeah.  It's a little gingerbread Hitler.  See, what I love about this is we're getting so politically correct that when someone just goes  completely the other way, it just makes me laugh uncontrollably.  And it makes the news. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Instantly.  Yeah.  Look at that book.  That's Frosty the Jew Hater.  There's no reason.  No.  No.  Can we get the story with the Nazi gingerbread cookies or whatever?  What do you think people are going to do when they see that?  Well, that's cute.  Aw.  Now that's what Christmas is all about.  Hey, man.  It's tough out there if you're a small business owner.  Now everyone knows what this guy's about.  That's what it is.  God bless him.  All right.  Michael Richards at the Laugh Factory in L.A. 
[00:29:30]  Here we go.  Dane's home club, by the way.  This is Dane Cook's home club in Los Angeles.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Shut up.  50 years ago, you had you all tied down with a fucking fork on your ass.  Now, okay.  All right.  That's kind of funny.  Got a big laugh.  That at least is like it's such it's completely outrageous.  But the imagery and everything is ridiculous and it got a laugh.  So, you know, you thought, okay, he's going to do some cutting edge racial humor. 
[00:30:00]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  At this point, he wasn't doing it.  He was just taking on the audience.  He got lucky with a good one.  He got lucky.  Yeah.  He got so pissed off.  He went after the heckler and he got a big laugh there.  This was not part of his act.  That was a little more fuel.  This was him just fighting back and then it just goes from here.  That was a little more fuel for the fire.  Let me tell you something.  When you're on stage, every comic has wanted to do this.  And I don't mean with blacks or Jews.  You've wanted to just unload the most vile thing you possibly can. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And it's unfortunate you've got to grovel and apologize.  It's only a moment in your life.  It doesn't mean anything.  That's what it is to – when you're pissed at somebody and you don't know them from a  hole in the wall, you can't pick out something personal about them because you don't know  them.  You're pissed at an anonymous stranger on the street because of something or in a club  as a heckler or in any situation where you don't know this person personally, what do 
[00:31:00]  you got to work with?  You're looking at them.  So all you have to work with is their looks, what they are, what they look like.  So you dredge up the most hurtful thing you can find.  Hey, you fat bastard.  Hey, you frigging look at you, you cross-eyed son of a bitch.  Like you find the most hurtful thing and that's what you use.  With black people, it's the N word. 
[00:31:30]  That's what you use.  I'm not saying it's the right thing to do.  I think there's a circuit breaker in your head that is supposed to trip and keep you  from doing that.  But it at least goes through the people's heads.  I don't care who you are.  If someone wrongs you, you're going to pick whatever you can to hurt them the most, whether  you say it or not.  It's going to be in your head.  The most liberal thinking person, if they get almost killed by somebody that's black,  it's at least going to pop, the word is going to pop in your head. 
[00:32:00]  You're going to go for the jugular, basically.  Right, because that's human nature.  Hey, this is coming in a lot.  I don't know how true this is.  Boys, a friend was at the show and said that the two black guys were heckling him.  Kramer said something stupid and they told him, shut his cracker ass up.  That's when Kramer started calling them the N word.  You should have just, if that's the truth, if it was just, ah, shut your cracker ass  up.  C, C word.  That's not a harsh enough thing to merit that response, to be honest with you. 
[00:32:30]  Because that was, the first line, fine.  But then they just keep going with it.  If that's all that happened, if it was one stupid line like that, it's like, come on,  man, you've got to know how to hit back.  Unfortunately for black people, they really don't have that atomic bomb of words to use.  Well, maybe they do.  With Whitey.  I almost stole a joke you've used.  Oh.  Maybe they do.  I say this today.  I say this today, let's have the black, let's have, let's have some of the black listeners  call up with the, the, the atom bomb from Whitey.  Let me correct that.  Let's have the black listener call up. 
[00:33:00]  The one black listener.  Yeah, where is he?  Yeah, someone will wake him up because I'm sure he has another day off.  Because we've all heard him.  You should give out the number because some people might not be, just be kind of casual  listeners.  1-866-313-FREE.  What is the atom bomb for white people?  See, see, we don't care what you call him.  Son-in-law?  That's the difference.  We don't care what you call us.  Yeah, we really, we don't have any words that really are the biggie, the big one. 
[00:33:30]  It's hard when you've been dominant.  I guess that's what it is.  I'm not saying white people haven't kind of brought on themselves, like themselves,  with me too, by abusing the word.  It's not like, it's not like it's an innocent word that white people are now victimized.  We can't use it.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Geez.  So sorry to be white.  So sorry to, you know, know how to make a wrench and then turn it and make a wheel and  then make cars and then build wonderful things for the world.  Instead of putting tires full of gasoline around each other's necks and lighting it on fire  or hacking each other apart with a machete because you're of a different country. 
[00:34:00]  Absolutely.  Or massacring six million Jews.  Oh, well, yeah.  All right.  There have been a couple of instances in history where white people get blamed for everything.  It's not like white people slaughtered the American Indians.  Did we really?  Oh, yeah, we did.  They were after each other.  Let me tell you something.  We were the first terrorists.  The American Indians were very much like Africa right now. 
[00:34:30]  Very territorial.  Very warlike.  And they would beat the crap out of each other for a long time before we got here.  You're right.  But we kind of did white people kind of get along.  We just gave the old express.  The old express extinction.  The old slate cleaner.  Right.  Here's the difference, though.  The old whitey was able to build a train that we could shoot out the windows of.  Here's the difference, though.  They took care of each other and they fought each other, but they continued to flourish. 
[00:35:00]  Did they?  Absolutely.  And would they have?  We completely wiped them out.  I'll say we didn't do it.  Travoy.  We completely wiped them out.  Invent wheels and stop dragging crap.  We did that.  I agree.  Ugh.  Before that.  Stupid Travoy.  Who said white people invented the wheel, by the way?  I don't know where that was.  I did.  I have a mic in front of me and I know it had to be some white guy that decided this role's  better.  Probably Africa or Asia.  I hate to put devil's advocate, but the wheel has been around for a while, long before.  I'd have to say. 
[00:35:30]  I would say the cradle of civilization, Mesopotamia.  Nope.  Jersey.  Bigfoot.  Jersey.  Bigfoot invented the wheel.  Bigfoot invented the wheel.  Bigfoot doesn't have a wheel.  Bigfoot invented the wheel.  I will not even stand for that.  Bigfoot invented the wheel.  Then why isn't Bigfoot driving or riding on his wheel?  Because his feet are too big for the gas pedals.  That's right.  He's hiding.  He can't fit in it.  It's in the garage.  The batteries won't charge.  He's hiding in the Pacific Northwest.  No, if Steve were in the Northwest, he'd be big dope. 
[00:36:00]  And he understands how flawed we are.  Big arms.  So he decides to continue to hide.  But he's got a wheel.  But he has a wheel out there.  Sasquatches are queer.  Yeah.  I dare the S word to come after me.  Kick him right in his Yeti bag.  How many names do you need for the stupid thing?  Exactly.  Hairy beast.  I've got to agree with you, though.  Yetis are queer.  Oh, they're the worst.  Bigfoot.  The Yeti.  The abominable snowman. 
[00:36:30]  Isn't the Yeti the snow one?  Yeah.  The white one.  Oh, the white one.  Yeah.  Now, he probably has a wheel.  He hangs out in the snow.  No, no.  Not the Bigfoot.  No, he has a snowmobile.  That's how he's already up to a snowmobile.  Yeah, he has to have the snowmobile.  That's good.  But Bigfoot.  Yeah.  It's all about Bigfoot.  You ever hear that, see it on YouTube, that Yeti just heckling or yelling?  Oh, hold on.  Hold on.  Thank you.  I'll just stop right there. 
[00:37:00]  Why?  I had a thought in my head, but somewhere between my brain and my mouth, it got all tripped up.  It just went through a humor filter and the humor stayed on top and then it happens.  Believe me, it happens to me a lot.  I hope the humor is able to be recycled back into the system.  All right.  Why don't we continue?  Here's Michael.  That was devoid of any.  Here's Michael Richards from the Laugh Factory in L.A.  Shut up.  Fifty years ago, I had you upside down with a white fork on your...  You can talk. 
[00:37:30]  You can talk.  You can talk.  You can talk your brain down with a...  Roll his ass out.  He's a...  He's a...  He's a...  Oh, my God.  He's a...  Best part is that woman.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That is...  I mean, look.  As much as I want to hug him and just being such a dick on stage, I mean, that really is  a little...  You can't...  Throw him out.  He's a...  He's a...  He's a...  He's a...  He forgot.  Throw him out is what you say.  The rest is what you think. 
[00:38:00]  Sometimes you have to have things that you just keep to your own self.  Yeah, perhaps you just keep your mouth shut.  Wow.  No, it was interesting.  He went on such a tirade that people got up and left.  And Jimmy made a great point that I wasn't thinking this morning.  This is why I hate Los Angeles.  The fact...  I mean, I understood people objected.  Here's how you object.  That was a...  A kind of a rough moment.  You don't have to laugh at it.  Kind of a rough moment.  But you don't get up and leave, you dumb white...  I'm talking about the white people filing out of the club.  Yeah.  People go to comedy clubs to see something alive and in the moment. 
[00:38:30]  You have the guy from Seinfeld screaming the N-word.  How much more alive can you get than that?  Coming apart at the seams.  He's unraveling.  Why wouldn't you want to watch that happen?  What do you want to do?  You want to see another polite set?  You're watching Kramer scream the N-bomb at a man in a balcony.  How do you walk out on that?  You're watching him self-destruct right there in front of your eyes live.  You're watching the greatest comedy show ever and you don't even know it. 
[00:39:00]  A historic moment.  Dummies.  They walked out.  They walked out.  I won't have this.  I won't.  But, Jimmy, you made a pretty good point that you think some of these people were walking  out because they were nervous that maybe the guys that were getting heckled might have  some weapons in there or something.  A pistol in the car or come back with a gang.  You know, believe me.  That's the way white people think.  They're going to come back and spray the entire club with bullets because of Michael Richards.  Because why would you leave unless you were scared for your life?  That's the only reason.  L.A. is so racially hypersensitive.  I've performed there. 
[00:39:30]  I mean, anything that remotely doesn't sound like it's 100% pro-racist, 100% pro-gay,  anything that's not 100% PC, they step back a bit and kind of give you like, oh, hey.  Hey, hey.  You're terrible out there.  All right.  Let's continue here.  I moved it back because you've got to hear the woman in the audience.  Oh, my God.  He's not a...  He's not a...  Oh, my God.  Look at the...  All right. 
[00:40:00]  You see?  It shocks you.  It shocks you.  You see?  What's there beneath your stupid mother...  What was it called for?  What was it called for?  It's not called for you to hear off my ass, you cheat mother...  You guys have been talking and talking and talking.  Oh, boy.  He just snapped.  He lost it.  And let me tell you how that feels, man.  Right?  Because I like the fact he kept going.  He didn't just back out.  He was angry. 
[00:40:30]  But, man, you get that where all of a sudden you just...  You have that, like, invisible shield on stage.  And then there comes a moment where all of a sudden you, like...  You realize I'm screaming.  This is another human being who's, like, close enough to throw a towel at my face.  There's really nothing in the way between us and them.  And then the crowd turns on you.  And that's where his anger came from.  Oh, what?  Oh, you just...  You want to bite their faces.  Like, didn't you see what this scumbag did to cause me to yell at him?  Yeah.  And now you turn on me, you want to just bite the audience. 
[00:41:00]  Hey, how did the media get the tape?  Someone had it on a phone.  It's probably from a cell phone.  It's terrible quality.  It is terrible quality.  Probably from YouTube.  I mean, thank God someone had that camera.  It's great.  Anything that happens in the world today will be captured on tape.  By the way, I...  In some way, shape, or form.  I plan on doing something like this.  And not important.  New Year's Eve at the Borgata.  I have a whole thing planned, so bring your video cameras.  Oh, okay.  Very good.  Oh, it's going to be ugly and controversial.  All right, we've got to take a break.  Part two of Michael Richards going off at the Laugh Factory. 
[00:41:30]  We got that.  By the way, it's a great commercial for XM today.  Sorry, but it is, because we're going to play the same stuff over there, unedited.  Yeah.  Uncensored.  Yeah.  Uncensored.  The FCC would allow us to play this, but for some reason, CBS has a problem with the N-word,  which is just...  The lawyers.  ...completely ridiculous to us.  Especially under these circumstances where you know the intent of it, and you know why  it's being used, and you know it's not coming from a place of anger or being gratuitous.  Come on.  So XM gets a nice commercial today.  Yep.  Also, we got Paul Rodriguez weighing in. 
[00:42:00]  We got Sinbad weighing in.  Wow.  We got...  They went to relevantcomic.com.  No kidding.  We got Kramer on Letterman.  Anthony saw this last night.  We got...  Oh, it's so uncomfortable.  We got Kramer.  We got Michael Richards on Letterman.  Just call him Kramer.  Just call him Kramer.  He only cares about his name.  Michael, he's Kramer.  We got the audio of him apologizing on Letterman.  Letterman got a great coup last night, man.  Huge.  He just happened to have Seinfeld on.  It was.  And they got the old satellite hookup, and they got Kramer on as well.  Boy, do I love Seinfeld.  Jerry thought it would be a good idea for Kramer to come on and apologize via satellite. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And he looked like he was in one of those MTV real-world confessionals.  He's just kind of sitting there, and I'm trying to make sense of what he's saying, and he could  not string together a cohesive thought.  It was just him babbling.  He looked drugged out to me.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  It might not have helped too much, and the audience was laughing. 
[00:43:00]  It's as simple as this.  If you're Kramer and you did that, and now you've got all this controversy, and you're  going to go on TV for the first time to apologize, if I was Kramer, I would make sure I was as  effed up as possible, so people would go, oh, look, the poor guy.  Obviously, he's got something going on.  Right.  We've got to let him off the hook a little bit here.  Look, he doesn't seem quite right.  You wouldn't go on Letterman completely like normal.  No.  Especially since I had just watched.  You can't defend this.  I had just watched Seinfeld at 11, and then Letterman came on at 11.30.  They got to the whole thing a little after midnight, and I just watched the goofy, fun 
[00:43:30]  Kramer character on Seinfeld.  So you're kind of like, oh, I just want to remember the fun guy.  Not this guy who can't word the apology right.  It's just really a wreck.  My favorite Kramer episode was the one where he was at the Laugh Factory.  That's my favorite Kramer episode.  And we'll get into it a little more after the break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:44:00]  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree, only on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Coming soon to a snooty mall.  Maybe one near you.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  The O.P. and Anthony Show will bring a busload of homeless degenerate shopping for Christmas presents.  And you, of course, are invited to watch and shop along.  The Golden Buns is going to get busy.  Immerse yourself in a time-honored tradition.  Enjoy the holiday spirit and the stench of booze and vomit as we partake in another homeless shopping spree on the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:44:30]  What?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The virus is spreading.  O.P. and Anthony.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show on XM202.  O.P. and Anthony.  All right, good morning.  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony Show, the ONA virus spreading across America.  A very busy morning. 
[00:45:00]  I'm looking at pictures of Starker Patty's facial.  Yeah.  They're now up on O.P. and Anthony.com, something we did over at XM yesterday.  And then it didn't replay the bit, so the XMers got really, really mad.  We're going to make good over there today.  But the video for everybody.  Everyone can enjoy it.  Even the people that don't have the XM.  Treat yourselves.  Treat yourself to the video.  It's up on O.P. and Anthony.com under the featured videos. 
[00:45:30]  It's called Starker Patty's facial.  It's just terrific.  Yes.  And make sure you check out the YouTube version so we can get our views up and wear whores.  We want lots of people to see that video.  But the pictures are really good as well, Anthony, on O.P. and Anthony.com.  In the middle of the Kramer controversy, we got part two of his set.  Actually, the set was probably a half hour or so, I would assume.  I don't know what he does there in the chair-wise.  We only got where he went off and just got nuts. 
[00:46:00]  Here's the second segment.  Ah.  Yes, I was just waiting for it to queue up.  Oh, I guess you got me there. 
[00:46:30]  You know, when you say, I guess you got me there.  He got you.  He got you there.  He got you.  He really was flustered, man.  I mean, I understand jokes that were bombing, but he didn't even have anything that resembled a joke.  He was just like, yeah, where are you going?  You didn't do no movies or nothing.  You just had the Seinfeld.  Right.  No movies or no other TV shows.  And you know Kramer's been thinking that ever since Seinfeld went off the air, like, oh, my God. 
[00:47:00]  Exactly.  But I'd said it before, but it's sort of, it's not really that accurate.  Or it's not really that demeaning to Kramer.  It's like Neil Armstrong.  Hey, you just went to the moon once.  You know, it's Seinfeld, for God's sake.  I disagree.  It's Michael Collins.  You just circled the moon while Neil Armstrong.  Oh, okay.  You still knew his name.  You honestly think that Kramer's sitting home going, whatever? 
[00:47:30]  No, he wants another hit.  Of course he wants a hit.  He wants a movie.  He wants something else.  Of course they do.  Everybody but Jerry is content to just, you know, I mean, Jerry is content to go back to stand-up comedy and just, you know, tour around.  He's got his family and everything like that.  But the rest of them, they want to recapture at least a piece of that success they had with Seinfeld.  And they also want to prove that they were, you know, they have what it takes on their own to make it without Seinfeld. 
[00:48:00]  That was like a, you know, that was a show that needed all the people that were in place to make that.  One more season.  Ensemble.  From what I understand, Seinfeld was offered five, this is just what I think, five million episodes.  And they all would have got a million episodes.  But Seinfeld said he didn't want to do one more season.  Yeah.  So I think they probably could have really, in that last season, made a million an episode.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know what, I'm sure they made a lot of money.  I'm sure they're making a lot of money as we speak.  They had good residual deals.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure they all did.  Yeah.  And Jerry, forget about it. 
[00:48:30]  That guy's worth a million bucks.  He doesn't have to do it.  Could be a couple more than that, Jim.  That's more than that, Jim.  Never had no show, never had no movie.  Seinfeld, that's it.  Oh, I guess you got me there.  You're absolutely right.  I'm just a wash up.  Got to stand on the stage.  Oh, that's it.  That's it.  We had it.  We had it.  We had it.  That's it.  That is it.  That's what I'm calling for.  That ain't necessary. 
[00:49:00]  Well, you interrupted me, pal.  That's what happens when you interrupt him right now.  Anyone, shut it down.  Interrupt a white man.  There you go.  Where is he, 1930?  That sounds to me like, man, the guy was probably being a dick as a heckler, but the guy was so  incensed that the racial stuff got thrown out there.  That seems like Michael, just from what I'm hearing, it sounds like Michael Richards just  fired that out of it.  I would love to know what was said beforehand, because it is odd that he would just throw 
[00:49:30]  the racial stuff out.  I don't know the guy from A Hole in the Wall.  Could be the biggest racist ever on the face of the earth.  I don't know.  But like what was said before that, that spurred him to just go right to the racist stuff.  Because the guy seemed so incensed.  And most black people, if they're firing racist stuff at you, you cracker this, you cracker  that white boy this, and you fire that back, I don't think they're going to be shocked  to hear it if they're firing stuff at you.  First of all, you're the bravest white man ever.  Because if they're saying, call me cracker and whitey, I'm in the wrong neighborhood and 
[00:50:00]  I'm running.  Well, yeah.  I'm running for my life.  But you know what I'm saying, they kind of would expect some kind of a racial response.  Yeah.  If somebody was hitting you racially, they're not going to be shocked that you hit them  back.  And that guy seemed really like outraged that he had gone there.  I don't know, whatever.  Yeah, we're going to find out what happened at the club that night, because we got Jamie,  the owner of the Laugh Factory, at 7.30 this morning.  It is all over.  Yeah, of course.  I'm looking, every TV I look at in this studio, they have the clip of him going off. 
[00:50:30]  It's just a great, great story.  But I haven't seen.  So many levels.  I haven't seen any of the apology.  Oh, there it is.  There it is.  Okay.  We got the audio from Letterman.  We're going to get into that in a second, but we got Sinbad audio.  Sinbad, and we also have Paul Rodriguez, and if there's two comedians, the first two I  thought of, actually, it's amazing they got them, because, I mean, they're as busy as  they've been lately.  It's really good that they were able to get Sinbad and Paul Rodriguez.  Luckily, they were able to pin them down for a quick comment on the way.  I was, you know, I was a little pissed off, because I was waiting for the Yakov Smirnoff comments. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  And what?  Nothing.  Nothing.  Not a peep.  Where's he?  Where's he?  Where is Yakov Smirnoff to just say, what the country, and make everyone feel better?  One of the edgiest comics working today.  Where's Gallagher?  Where is Gallagher?  Can Gallagher maybe, he should dye a watermelon black on one side, white on the other, and  smash it with his mallet, as if he is smashing racial hatred. 
[00:51:30]  Am I the only one that sees it?  Gallagher?  Racist.  Why?  Look how he treats that watermelon.  Ah.  Racist.  Another racist comic.  I want to hear from, how about we hear from Chris Rock, or, you know, another really  Yeah, someone who's maybe relevant, that has really done edgy racial humor before.  I mean, Chris Rock has gone off on the black community.  On stereotypes.  On the black community.  You see, I love how I got to say black community, because if you just say black people, or blacks, 
[00:52:00]  it sounds bad.  But if you say the black community, for some reason, like I heard that more yesterday than  I ever have.  People calling up, just want to comment, you know, the black community has to realize,  because when you put community behind it, all of a sudden you're, you're safe.  Although I will say on this one, Chris Rock, I don't think there's enough much to defend  Michael Richards on, I'm sure.  Oh, well, no, but the truth of the matter is, if a white guy had done Chris Rock's material 
[00:52:30]  verbatim, it really would come off, it would be funny, but I think he would get a lot of  complaints.  Yeah.  A lot of complaints.  We should get Patrice O'Neill on today.  Why?  Because he's our black, he's our black.  Teasing, of course.  I would love to have Patrice on.  He's our black friend.  Yeah.  That does comedy.  That's it.  Kind of helps today.  Hey, you want to hear Sinbad or Paul Rodriguez?  It's Pride and Carlin, as far as I'm concerned.  So whichever one you pull out first, I mean, it's all, it's all, it's all gravy from here. 
[00:53:00]  Flip a coin.  Here's Sinbad.  Joining me from Los Angeles for more on this story is a familiar face to many people.  The comedian is Sinbad.  It's a Sinbad.  Yeah, what year?  Did we go on a time machine?  Familiar face if you're watching Star Search or the Apollo in 1991.  Familiar face if you're wearing spandex.  Yeah, or if you're white and you're like comedians, you might as well be white.  Familiar face if you got one of those shirts with Chinese or Japanese rights.  He's riding on it.  Just stepped out of a smoking DeLorean.  Right.  Are you kidding me?  What year is this? 
[00:53:30]  Familiar face if you don't have the internet yet.  Hey, it's an...  Familiar face, my God.  Sam, I think he was killed by a...  Wow, Quincy.  That's unbelievable.  Quincy's such a racist.  He really is.  He works with an Asian guy.  That's how I closed my eyes, too.  It's beyond amazing.  It's the hand.  He only wants...  Well, he only had Sam because he likes smooth Asian massages.  Right.  Sam, after a tough one, Quincy would just lay down and his teeth would be all clenched in 
[00:54:00]  the pillow.  Clenched together.  Yeah, clenched together, and Sam would get on and just knead out those knots.  After Quincy's used the skull saw on somebody, and it's been maybe a little bit of a trying  day and needs a back rub.  Or he would just hang his arms over the bed, and Sam would massage his hands gently while  telling him, Quincy, you know, we're going to solve this.  It's going to be okay.  And he'd thank him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you, Sam.  All right, here we go.  We got Sinbad. 
[00:54:30]  Best impression ever.  I got to hear the best part.  No one knows.  Joining me from Los Angeles for more on this story is a familiar face to many people, the  comedian Sinbad, who was inside the club.  Maybe a familiar face to his family.  Now I'm offended.  I'm more offended by what he just said.  I now understand why he's on, and I apologize to Sinbad.  He was in the club when it happened.  Was he?  I did not realize that until this guy just said it, so he certainly should be in the club.  Commiddling?  God, you think Sinbad's like, man, how lucky am I?  Yep. 
[00:55:00]  I just happen to be in the right place at the right time.  It would have been funny if Michael, if Michael Richards was shouting that stuff and he was  just in, in intro-ing Sinbad.  Speaking of, oh, God, yeah.  And then just a nice segue into his intro.  Comedian Sinbad, who was inside the club when Richards melted down.  Sinbad, you just heard Michael Richards' apology on television.  It hasn't actually aired yet.  It won't air for a little while on the David Letterman show.  What do you think of that apology?  Does that make amends? 
[00:55:30]  Does that make up for what happened?  That's like a man apologizing to his wife when he's been caught cheating.  It really means nothing because he got caught.  I just, I had just walked in the comedy club.  I had been about maybe five, 10, 15 minutes, and Mike was doing his thing.  I don't understand.  He says he was angry and he's not a racist.  You know, there's not that much anger at a heck.  It was a heckler, man.  And he wasn't even heckling hard.  And he just went crazy, man.  I mean, he went like, it wasn't an accidental slip, man, because he kept going and going and going. 
[00:56:00]  Oof.  And he said he wasn't heckling hard either.  Yeah.  I mean, that's what comes from a comic.  I mean, if he said, look, he was being heckled hard, he should have handled it better.  Obviously, Kramer had some frustration that has been building up in him for a while.  You've been heckled before to club him.  What's the way that...  You suck.  You're supposed to handle that.  Well, remember, heckler's a part of the job.  I mean, I look at it.  If you work as a highway person and then you work on a highway and then people go by and blow the horn at you, that's part of the job.  But for me, I've never to this day had anybody thrown out of a club because I've never had a situation I couldn't handle because the audience is not my enemy. 
[00:56:30]  And the audience was not his enemy.  The whole idea is how you turn it around.  And there's never any reason to bury somebody.  You don't have to bury them.  Wrong.  And if you're going to bury somebody...  Wrong.  Wrong.  Hey, F.O. Merman, the audience is not your best friend.  And let me tell you something.  I deal with this a lot.  And it's not...  It's really weird when I see black people in the audience sometimes. 
[00:57:00]  There is a look you get as a white comic.  It's the...  No one's saying anything.  You don't address it because the guy's not being rude to you.  No one's yelling at you.  And the audience can't see it.  But as a performer, you can see it.  Well, what's that about?  Is that black people don't want to give you the respect?  I don't know if it's that or if it's just your humor is just not hitting them.  I really don't know.  I've noticed it consistently throughout my career.  I actually...  Maybe this is me.  It's really interesting to say that because when you played Helium down there in Philly, 
[00:57:30]  I was in the back row watching black people watch you and they wouldn't give you nothing.  No, of course not.  And the whole crowd was dying.  And I'm like...  And I remember thinking to myself, what's that really about?  Do they think Jimmy's not funny or they don't want to laugh at a white comic?  Like, what is that?  There's something pretty deep happening right in front of me here.  Black people...  And again, that could just be one set.  But I've noticed it for years.  And it seems like black audience members with a white comic are more comfortable when you  have a certain vibe. 
[00:58:00]  And maybe no matter what I'm talking about, they can kind of sense that this is the way  I am.  And they just don't like the personality behind it.  Or I remind them of people that just...  I don't like his thought process because I know where...  Right.  I know where it'll lead.  They're not afraid of me.  They're not threatened by me.  They just don't like my thought process.  Or I remind them of a thought process they don't like.  And there's times...  Sometimes I'm sure you don't think I'm funny, but you can sense that it's more than that.  Because there's times where I'm doing something and I'm killing.  And I know what I'm killing.  And I look down and I see that one face and you want to go, what is this about?  Or a guy reluctantly starting to laugh. 
[00:58:30]  I've seen that.  There was a guy last night in the back of the cellar.  A black guy with his girlfriend.  Is that how they run that place?  It certainly is.  And she was laughing.  And I know what I'm doing is working because of the reactions from the audience.  And eventually he laughed and then like lowered his head like he didn't even want to laugh.  And you get that from people, but when you notice it consistently from black people...  I remember I told Damon Wayans that.  Black people just don't really like me in the audience.  Happens.  Yeah, I noticed it firsthand down there in Philly that day. 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, but I'm not making it up and I'm not paring it.  No, absolutely not.  You're a likable guy.  Yeah, my material is not groveling.  But I'm not saying I'm tearing the ass out of the world, man.  I'm not.  But it's just, it's not typically, especially...  It's aggressive.  Yeah.  But you also do a fair share of self-deprecation.  Black people don't really care for that or sarcasm.  They get it.  They just don't care for it in humor.  They don't like really pedophilia or religious stuff either.  Like sexual stuff, they're really liberal with.  There's a lot of stuff black crowds love, but there's certain things that just don't go for it. 
[00:59:30]  All right, let's get to the end of this Sinbad clip.  You don't have to bury anybody.  And if you're going to bury somebody, you don't get personal with it.  You don't come up with hatred.  And you definitely don't come up with racism or sexism.  Right.  Sexism.  You use whatever you got at that point.  You use whatever you got.  You don't come up with sexism?  Shut your cruise boat face.  Shut up, boat act.  God, does he annoy me. 
[01:00:00]  You don't come up with sexism?  I could see saying that was uncalled for.  It was.  But you don't come up with sexism?  Should you call somebody a doody face and then smile at them with your tucked in stupid satin shirt?  Let me tell you something.  If there was a party of women at a table and they were yapping during Sinbad's set, you don't think he'd turn around and make some kind of a woman joke about that table?  Turn around and talk about, you know, or a bachelorette party is sitting there and he's just going to ignore the fact that it's a table full of women talking and not address them as women and make it fun by joking about something involving women? 
[01:00:30]  Of course you are.  That's your ammo.  That's what you got right there.  Well, he's a boat act now.  He's very family friendly, so I don't know.  It annoys me.  That annoys me.  I agree with him at first, but you don't ever bury somebody.  Really?  You don't, stupid?  I wish it was the Andrea Doria. 
[01:01:00]  All right.  Sinbad goes on.  Bug me.  Let me ask you this question because, you know, we dance around the N-word all the time.  Paul Rodriguez, who was on the bill as well, fellow comedian of yours, said today in this press conference,  any time the N-word comes out of a white person's mouth, they've got some explaining to do.  They better have a good reason for it.  He said explaining, by the way.  Go F yourself.  We don't explain anything.  Paul Rodriguez said you've got some explaining to do.  He ripped off Ricky Ricardo.  But in that sense, Rodriguez is right. 
[01:01:30]  I mean, you do have to justify it.  You better have a reason for it coming out.  Look, it's like in a perfect world, everyone can say everything, but there's better be a good reason for it.  It's just the way it is.  There is a huge double standard, and you've got to deal with it.  So, yeah, if you blurt it out in hate, you're going to have to pay the price.  It's just the way it is.  If you blurt it out in something hysterically funny, in a creative way, if it's used in humor like that, no problem with it.  Why the hell can some comics get away with it and others not?  But when I've seen – how many black comics have you seen do the, hey, I'm the white guy, where they do the white guy voice? 
[01:02:00]  Well, look at me.  I'm cutting the lawn, dear.  You know, that's fair game.  It is.  But if you get up there and go, and do a stereotypical black guy, there's going to be a problem.  Once again, devil's advocate, but can't we do have to acknowledge that for a long time, black people weren't even allowed to play black people? 
[01:02:30]  But I mean sometimes there are things that are a reaction to a lot of behavior.  I can understand that.  Like, look, they had to have white people with blackface.  They wouldn't allow black people to act.  I mean it's like I kind of understand it to some degree.  Just too much time has gone by, please.  There's not one person – there's not one person that was alive at that time.  Come on.  Well, there are some.  Oh, but they're old and crotchety.  Over the age of –  They're old –  40.  Yeah.  Once – thank God because there is a – you do reach a certain age where everything disappears. 
[01:03:00]  Passion, lust, love, racism, where you just become old and crotchety.  It doesn't matter what color you are or anything.  You're just a doddering old fool.  You don't even look your color anymore when you get old.  No.  You know, it doesn't matter.  White people –  You all turn kind of gray.  You're at the home of a black guy.  You're all going in your diaper together.  Yeah.  That's all.  You finally – right before you check out of this planet, you finally get along with everybody. 
[01:03:30]  That's right.  Hey, let's get to the end of this Sinbad clip here.  Please.  We got to get Jamie, the owner of the Laugh Factory on.  We got Patrice O'Neill calling in.  We got Kramer's apology on Letterman.  That's some explaining to do.  They better have a good reason for it.  You have black comedians throw it around all the time.  But where's the line there?  Try to help us out here.  Here's the line, man.  First of all, we talk about family.  Let's face it, the N-word.  We call it the N-word now like people don't use it.  What's happening now in society is that there's a friendly version of the N-word, which was 
[01:04:00]  and then I guess the mean version is supposed to be.  Oh, boy.  To me, there's no friendly version.  This is the problem.  There is no time that word was friendly.  There was no time in life that word was ever friendly.  That's probably one of the most vile words that's ever been put on a race of people.  Talk to your own people, then.  Sorry.  Since the beginning of this time, beginning of this civilization, this country.  Well, black people didn't invent the word.  But address the rappers that use it constantly.  But they have no problem using it in a fun way. 
[01:04:30]  Guys, I'll say one thing, though.  Sinbad never was that type of an act.  And Cosby, he's a guy that has been speaking out against it and finds it reprehensible.  Yeah.  Oh, there are plenty of people that speak out against it.  Plenty of black guys that speak out against it.  But, I mean, come on.  The multitude of black guys just hanging out.  I'm not even talking famous people.  Just people hanging out.  Go uptown.  You'll hear that being thrown around like crazy.  Just in conversation.  Use it like the word thaw.  Yeah.  It's just – so how can you then make it a big thing where you can't use it in any context? 
[01:05:00]  It's very few words, I think, have that double standard.  But, look, I don't really mind it that much with this one because it's very –  You're dating a black chick?  No, man.  Oh, okay.  But this is a very rare occasion you're going to actually legitimately need to use it.  And it's like – it's kind of hard as a white guy to go, ah, my rights are being styled.  They're really not.  I mean, but when we're discussing it like a news story, that annoys me that we can't use it.  But aside from that, it's like what else do you want to use it aside from, you know, when you're being sexual with a girl or someone doesn't get your food fast enough? 
[01:05:30]  That is legitimate.  I mean, there's very few places to use it.  Why don't we have any black guys that we can talk to?  We got Patrice.  We don't know any.  Where's Patrice?  He's on hold.  We got to take a break, though.  We have to.  We're really late.  And then we'll get Jamie from the Laugh Factory on.  I want to hear Patrice's opinion on this.  Yes.  He's slightly racially opinionated.  All right.  Slightly.  Why don't we do that next then, okay?  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Yeah, everyone's talking about that.  It's the big story.  Also, the listener's talking about the Stalker Patty facial video, Anthony.  Oh, it's wonderful.  Look at it on YouTube.  It's not really in the YouTube search yet.  People are finding it through opieandanthony.com right now. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Go to opieandanthony.com.  There's a featured video section.  And, you know, click on the Stalker Patty facial video.  It's really, really funny.  Something we did on the XM show yesterday.  Visually just hysterical.  Absolutely.  Hysterical.  The sheer quantity of garbage that is dumped on her face is really funny.  And it's getting a lot of attention from YouTube this morning.  Yeah.  It's a perfect YouTube video. 
[01:07:30]  Right.  It's got everything a YouTube video should have.  And the pictures are up on opieandanthony.com.  Some of the pictures are more disturbing than the actual video.  Yeah.

Make sure you click on the YouTube version so we can get the views up.  Yeah, look at that picture.  That's like a shotgun blast wound.  She is the worst.  And her sexy talk. 
[01:08:00]  Did you hear her sexy talk?  It is so incredibly bad.  She is so bad at having any sex appeal.  Yeah, we wanted her to talk dirty to the camera, but it just didn't work out.  Horrible old maid.  She got a couple lines out and then it just got awful.  These pictures are terrific.  Wow, that is really bad.  We just give and give and give on this show.  That's what we're about.  Check out the video on opieandanthony.com.  We're giving to the listeners today. 
[01:08:30]  The Stalker Patty facial.  It's all the rage this morning.  Robin Hood.  We take her dignity and give to the audience.  Give to our funny bones.  I think she made, what, $350 off that one.  Yeah, we're always giving her money.  The hard way.  Patrice O'Neal, what's up, buddy?  Good morning, sir.  How are you?  There he is.  What up?  Patrice, I'm sure you've been up all night following this breaking story.  Right.  I ain't been up all night.  I thought I was getting stalked this morning.  I got to call her.  Hey, you know what?  I got to tell you, man. 
[01:09:00]  CNN gets Sinbad and we get Patrice O'Neal.  Yep.  Well, they said, you know how Sinbad is, you know?  Black hammer pants always has a good...  At least we got a black guy.  Well, Sinbad, don't say that.  Come on.  He's more white than black, Patrice.  Come on.  The guy's got freckles.  Hey, look, man.  First of all, about Cosmo, I'm all about to follow him from Friday.  He's one of these conceptual Andy Kaufman type dudes.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  So when I saw the video, I thought at first, you know, that was...  He was just doing some old weird, I only understand what I'm doing stuff.  You know what I mean?  I didn't think he was racist until he apologized.  So he got...  Until he's like, I'm sorry, because sometimes I have direct racism and I didn't mean it and  I just lose it.  So I said, you idiot.  Now, okay, and then you see he was on Letterman last night, which means last night he had five 
[01:10:00]  red dots on his forehead because Jerry sent out some hit men, but season seven is coming  out on DVD, like, in a couple of days.  And he better hope all the guilty white people who's not going to buy season seven is replaced  by black people who think this is hilarious.  It's funny to me.  You know what?  You bring up a great point, though.  His apology was so bad.  It was one of the worst apologies I've ever seen for anything like this. 
[01:10:30]  He was apologizing for being a racist.  Yeah.  And then he said he wasn't a racist, but then he said he's got his own problems.  And then he said Afro-Americans, like he used a term from 1975.  What was he, eulogizing X?  What's the matter with him?  Yeah.  Afro-Americans.  All I'm going to do is picture him sliding through the door going, ah, Jerry Coon.  Jerry. 
[01:11:00]  I want to apologize to the Negroes, Jerry.  How do I do it?  We'll get you on Letterman.  He's so stupid.  I was watching it thinking, you know, okay, first of all, that the dude, first of all, another thing, America makes me sick.  White people make me sick because I don't need no apology.  Like, that word has no, Cosmo Kramer, using that word, has no power at all.  Right.  I'd have been rolling if I was that dude up on the top. 
[01:11:30]  See, this is what makes me mad, though, on the black side.  Is that you know the camera didn't catch that jerk that made Kramer mad enough to go back to the 60s.  See, the comics are the ones that go, you know, what was this ass saying?  Except for Sinbad, who says, you never get sexist or racist.  That boat act.  And you never go all out against an audience member.  Yeah, Sinbad said that, Patrice.  I don't know if you heard it.  He goes, you never.  I didn't hear the whole thing. 
[01:12:00]  I heard him at the end say the reprehensible word.  And it is.  But it was way more.  It's like saying a C word right now.  And then, like, you call a woman who's talking the C word in the audience.  And she goes, you being a racist, man, I was so afraid for my life.  Like, and maybe in 1930, if he said that, it would be horrifying because you could actually choke her and then say, and the cop will shake your hand. 
[01:12:30]  And now, that's your power.  So I'm not making an excuse for Cosmo because he said the word, but it has no power like it had for, like, Sinbad to announce as if we're still in the same position we was in the 60s.  Yeah.  I want white boys to be able to see what they feel like saying because I don't want to feel condescended, you know, to where it's like, okay, Negro.  Bravo, Patrice.  We'll take care of you. 
[01:13:00]  Well spoken.  You call me a Negro and I just want to call you everything.  I want to call you because I don't ever want to stop being able to call white crackers and burners and destroyers of the earth.  So you can laugh, Negro.  Burners and destroyers.  Exactly.  Stupid bunch of inventors.  You invented nothing.  You go to the moon, people.  Yeah.  The nerve of you creating medicine.  I'm sure.  Unger.  Unger.  Unger.  Unger.  Listen to me. 
[01:13:30]  If it wasn't for white people, medicine would still depend on the weather.  I just don't, I just don't think, man, I just, I didn't think he was a racist until he apologized.  Yeah.  The apology was worse than what he did.  Because he's a crazy type dude.  If you ever watched that show Friday back in the day.  Yeah.  Out of his mind type of guy.  He did all that.  It was a weird character he used to do.  And then he would just do, like you said, this conceptual stuff. 
[01:14:00]  So, but I don't think that's what this was.  No.  As a, as he, he became a regular, he, he really blew it, man.  Because his whole life has been set up to be this dude who wasn't attached.  He, when I used to see him interviewed as a regular dude, he would just, he'd be like,  and you go, all right, this dude's out of his mind.  But last night on Seinfeld, who, who called and made him apologize, by the way?  Somebody had a bullet to his, he was going to get killed last night if he didn't take, 
[01:14:30]  get on there.  Yeah.  I think Jerry was going to be on the Letterman anyway, right?  Yeah.  And, and he decided, he decided, ah, you know something, let me, let me get this idiot out  of trouble.  Wait, do we have the apology on tape?  Yeah.  Why don't we get into that?  Do you want that with Patrice online?  So I would like to hear what his thoughts are.  Yeah.  No problem.  Stay right there, Patrice.  Here's Kramer on Letterman last night.  We have him live by a satellite from Los Angeles.  Sorry, this should be Michael Richards.  Michael, are you there?  Yeah, I'm right here.  Hi, Michael.  Welcome to the show.  Hello.  Hi.  How are you doing?  I'm not doing too good. 
[01:15:00]  Why don't you explain exactly what happened for the folks who may not know?  I, I lost my temper on stage.  I was at a comedy club trying to do my act, and I got heckled, and I, I, I took  it badly and went into a, a rage, and, uh, uh, said some pretty, uh, nasty things to  some Afro-Americans.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:15:30]  Trash.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  This guy's a scream  All I wanted was for him to bring me a mint julep  Afro-American  Said some pretty nasty things to some colored people, Jerry  The colored people  You see the audience laughing?  The audience is laughing  They don't understand that Kramer is a character  This is the slide through the door guy, Kramer guy  They can't understand that this is actually Michael Richards  They think they're seeing Kramer still 
[01:16:00]  He's going to do something like they're laughing  Waiting for him to do something weird  And then I ring just went off, Jerry  Like they're waiting for him to do that  So they're kind of nervously laughing, waiting  Bunch of dopes in the audience  They don't realize he's  That he's a different guy  He's not that guy that lives across from Jerry Seinfeld  They can't separate the two  Do you hear him, though?  He sounds like one of those hostage videos, man  Oh, yeah, and he looked like one  He was squirming in his seat  He couldn't put a sentence together 
[01:16:30]  Without a big gap  And he was almost crying  The audience is laughing at him  He's using terminology from the 50s  Yeah  All right, let's get back into it here  Nasty things to some Afro-Americans  A lot of trash talk  And stop laughing  It's not funny  And Jerry  Jerry had to jump in  Stop laughing  It's not funny  Jerry, you should have led the applause break  That's hilarious that he just said that 
[01:17:00]  Stop laughing  Hello, Kramer  Why did you call him a coon?  Jerry  Kramer  Stop laughing  This isn't funny  But it is funny, Jerry  It's a real moment  It's funny  Stop laughing  Because he knew this guy was really trying to apologize  But he couldn't  But it was  And Jerry's taking season seven money  They could have diffused the situation by going with the last with the audience  Going, you know  This was so serious 
[01:17:30]  That it was  He was trying to be so serious with this apology  That laughter wasn't even a consideration  And the people  When he said Afro-American  I swear to you it looked like an SNL bit  Or something  Like  No one  It's like it was written for him  All right  Instead of African-American  Say Afro-American  To show how out of touch you are  And then  People will laugh  And then Jerry jump in  And then Elaine will come out  And George will come out  And talk about 
[01:18:00]  The Jews  And the Asians  And then  He  He couldn't apologize properly  He didn't  You know  I didn't even see Jerry's reaction to all that  I know he hit his head  As soon as he  He messed up  As he was reading that apology  And said Afro-American  I know Jerry wanted to say  Cut you  Idiot  And another thing  How does Cosmo  Kramer  Who hasn't been on TV since 86  When they use Afro-American  Even get on Letterman last night 
[01:18:30]  During Jerry's time  Jerry said  Dave look  Call this dude on the phone  Yeah  That's like  Jerry said  Dave call this nigga up  If I can smack him  With his stupid face  What's the matter with him  He was  He's so uncomfortable  I'm still  Let me tell you man  This dude is so crazy  That  That  Someone  The only way  You can really find out  What happened  Is if you just  Give somebody  A tape recorder  Just off  Off camera  Off everything  And really try to talk to them  What were you thinking  I don't really want to write him off 
[01:19:00]  As a racist  Because I know how crazy he is  That he's Kramer  He should have spoken  Through his lawyer  Jackie Childs  Yeah  They should have brought  Jackie Childs  From the show in  As his lawyer  And like  First show Cosmo  And apologize  And then the camera  Pulls back  And his lawyer  Jackie Childs  Is right next to him  Hysterical  People love Seinfeld  They'd have  Forgiven him  Forgiven him in a second  Absolutely  Cosmo  What'd you say boy  Yeah  What'd you say Cosmo  I think we get money out of this 
[01:19:30]  Alright let's get back to this  Michael Richards on Letterman  Last night  And what  What was the  You were actually being heckled  Or were they just talking  And disturbing the act  That was going on too  What a fast thinker  Did you  I know I'm hearing your audience  Laughing on it's  It's  I'm not even sure  That this is  Where I should be  Addressing  The situation 
[01:20:00]  I've already heard you  Make some jokes about it  And that's okay  You know  But I'm  Jerry was trying  I'm really busted up  Over this  Oh shut your mouth  He's beginning to really  You groveling idiots  Shut up  Oh the groveling  Isn't even near over  My family  They're not bad  Making fun of it  They're mad for laughing  Because you couldn't  Handle a situation  Shut your mouth  I couldn't understand  This is  This goes  This takes me back  To the Mel Gibson  I'm sitting there like  How much money  Do you have to have  To be able to be  An anti-Semite  Like 
[01:20:30]  Why can't you just  Go ahead and look  I don't like the Jews  And you start wars  Let me go  I am  Yeah  I got enough money  Yeah  Like what  These apologies  Is what makes you seem  Like  I'm sorry  You know what you should say  I'm sorry  I usually do a better job  At hindering my disgust  For other races  When I blew it last night  Under pressure  Yeah  Talk about that man  You know  That is  That's the worst thing  You can say  He should say  I was playing  I was playing  And then 
[01:21:00]  Keep it moving  No he was just  I apologize  It's like he mowed down  A schoolyard full of kids  In a car  I don't want that  Little pushy apology  Excuse me  I don't  I don't want that  That's a  That apology means  Nothing  To anybody black  It's like  Shut up  You racist  All right  Let's get back  Into this  I didn't like  The way he was 
[01:21:30]  He's like  Being mad at Letterman  For making fun  What is Letterman  Supposed to do  Not address it  You jackass  Yeah  Yeah  A couple of jokes  Were made  I mean that's okay  I mean since I couldn't  Do it  You might as well  You know  I'm  I'm really busted up  Over this  And I'm  I'm very very sorry  To those  People in the audience  The blacks  The Hispanics  The whites  Everyone that was there  That took the brunt  Of that anger  And hate  And rage  And how it came through 
[01:22:00]  And I'm concerned  About more hate  And more rage  And more anger  Coming through  Not just towards me  But towards  A black white  Conflict  Oh  Now he represents  All of white people  In this country  And how blacks  Feel about  He actually  Started  Coming off like  He represents  White people  And doesn't want  This to ruin  The relationships 
[01:22:30]  Between blacks  And whites  The great relationship  That's going on  Between blacks  And white people  Who does he think  He is  Rodney King  Or the  What's the matter  With this  Jerry  Can we all  Just get along  Jerry  You're a mediocre comic  Who got a break  Shut up  That's what you are  I want to hear  The apology  From Paul Reiser  For calling  Carlos Mancia  Spig  Did you guys  See that one  No  I'm just messing  With you  I'd love to see  Reginald Denny  Hit him with a brick  I want to see  All the YouTubes 
[01:23:00]  Of every racial  Outburst  Of every sitcom  Star from the  Mid 90s  Yeah  I got a theory  By the way  There you go  I think Kramer  Was just trying  To make a YouTube  Video  Everybody wants  To make a YouTube  Video  And I think  He's like  You know what  Did a great job  I got an idea  Watch the hits  Today on this  Freaking thing  Oh yeah  Watch the  Views on this  Video from the  Laugh Factory  Gregory by the way  Right  If you don't plug  Black Phillip  For you know  The 25th  I'm going to call  You a racist

[01:25:00]  Everything  Ah  The Emancipation  Proclamation  My cats were  Talking to me  They told me  To get on that  Stage  Newman  Put me up  To it  Jerry  It was  Newman  And you know  Many of the comics  Many performers  Are in  Las Vegas  And New Orleans  Trying to raise money  For what happened there  And  Uh  For this to happen  For me to be  In a comedy club 
[01:25:30]  And flip out  And say this crap  You know  I'm  I'm deeply  Deeply sorry  Oh  How much more sorry  God did he annoy me  With that  Wow  How about just like  Look man  I got really angry  I screwed up  I apologize  It was rather tasteless  And stupid  You know  It's not the way I feel  But yeah  I was trying to handle it  Trying to handle it  In a certain way  Where it was going to be  Irreverent  And a little  You know  A commentary  On words  And it really came out  The wrong way  And looked bad  And you know  Sorry about that  But it happens  You know

[01:27:00]  He  He was always so confused  That's how Kramer was  Last night  Like Dr. Bellows  After he saw like  A car disappear  In front of his eyes  Right  Saw Major Nelson  Flying  But  Major Nelson  Was flying  And  The black people  Jerry  Jerry  All right  We'll get a review  And Patrice O'Neill  Calling back  So it's the ONA virus  Spreading across America  Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton  And the comedians  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Are appearing in a special  Holiday edition of FHM  On sale now  E-Rock's creepy photos

I tried to hang up on y'all  Before you said  People saying you gotta go  You weren't even close to that  Hey but listen  No your phone card ran out  And here's the thing  I heard all three of you  Immediately 
[01:28:30]  This is why  Thank you for letting everyone  Every white person is racist  This is why  It's a good thing  That Cosmo Kramer  Because the first thing  Opie goes is  Ah he's lazy  And then  Anthony goes  His phone probably got cut off  And then Norton  Goes  I like to talk to him  On a balcony  So  Oh my god  Shut up Norton  So  Cosmo  Here's why  Here's what  Makes me sick 
[01:29:00]  About white people  Right  Black people  Are the only people  Now look at Mel Gibson  The  Soonest  Jews  They  They muscled up  Braveheart  And the Godfather  When they thought for a second  That they were  Saying some anti-Semitic stuff  No one  But white people  Are the only people  That are in charge  Of black people's  Upsetness about  The word  You know  The N word  Now you got black people  Saying the N word 
[01:29:30]  We are comfortable  Saying the word  Nigger  We're comfortable with it  We live with it  It doesn't mean anything  To us anymore  And some people  Take that as some type of  Oh my god  This is  This is horrifying  But some people  Like me go  White boys  Say what you want to say  Man  I'm better than you  And better than your  Stupid words  But white people  Racism is a war  Between soft white people  And racist white people  Yes  White guilt  Norton taught me about  White guilt over the years  That's right  Now we shouldn't have it 
[01:30:00]  We have to keep fighting  Because they're getting  Oh  That's not what I meant  Hey can we go back to the  The Kramer audio from Letterman  Patrice just said something  That made me  Oh I forget what I was  Going to ask you Patrice  Yeah  Ah you raised a good point  Alright  Let's get back to the audio  It'll come to you Jimmy  Kramer on Letterman last night  We're almost done here  Let me interrupt here for a second  And ask a question about  Had the people doing the heckling  Or the people who were not  Paying attention  Had they been white or Caucasian  Or any other race 
[01:30:30]  What would have been the nature  Of your response then  It may have happened  You know I'm a performer  I push the envelope  I work in a very uncontrolled  Manner on stage  I do a lot of free association  And spontaneous  I go into character  I do  I don't know  In view of the  Of the situation  And the act  Going where it was going  I don't know  The rage  The rage did go all over the place  It went to  It went to everybody in the room  But you can't  You know 
[01:31:00]  It's  I don't  Everyone in the room  Blacks could feel  What is  I'm not a racist  That's what's so insane about this  And yet  It's sad  It comes through  It fires out of me  And  Even now  In the  In the passion  And the  That's here  As I  He's just lost it  Confront myself  You know what would have been funny  If he apologized  If he came on  And he goes  Dave  You know how they are in clubs 
[01:31:30]  They talk all the time  And they heckle  And they don't tip  And their orders are hard to follow  And I'm trying to do my bit  And they won't shut up  He should apologize as Kramer  Yeah that's what people wanted  That would have been fun  They wanted Kramer  The thing is this  White people are stereotyped all the time  It's not just black  How do you think  It feels like  Whenever there's sunshine  Or good things happening  Or joy  People go  Ah it must be a white man around  How do you think we feel  Having to deal with that  Whenever there's a smile  On a child's face  That's a lot of pressure  Where is the white man responsible for this 
[01:32:00]  A lot of pressure to live up to  The worst apology ever given  For anything  Horrid  Here's the final clip  And Seinfeld finally gets involved  A little bit  When you say  I'm not a racist too  When you have to like  Blurt that out  That's a little rough  You probably are  Who cares if Cosmo's a racist  Agreed  Who cares  Exactly  Yeah no one gives a crap in the end  He's just trying to you know  Save his reputation  So he gets some more projects  It's like no one is surprised 
[01:32:30]  Except for white people  Who live in their goofy little lie  That none of you are racist  All of you are  Hold on but you are too  Patrice  I thank God  Alright  I have finally made it  Where someone could  I want to be called a racist  That makes me feel like  Now it's all equal  I believe everyone's a bit racist  And everyone's a bit hypocritical  I don't  I'm not a racist  I just find blacks to be  Less enjoyable than my wife  Yeah  And people get confused 
[01:33:00]  They don't think black people  Can be racist  No  I pray that one day we can really be  Cause I'm ready  You're ready to go  I think once it's all accepted  We'll get along like never before  The first thing I do is hang all three of you up upside down  And beat the bottom of your feet with something hard  Wow  I know  Our perfect pink feet  Hey I've been writing it down  I'm ready  Alright  Yeah Patrice has a list 
[01:33:30]  He's got to get to  I'm ready baby  And he doesn't even want to do that to hurt us  It's just a sexual thing for him  Maybe you can hang us on a swing in your bedroom creep  My fault  I didn't finish  And also I want to tickle you  Alright let's get into the last clip here  Seinfeld getting involved  And having apologized  Is there much more you can do?  Much more you would like to do?  You should have done a plug  I just have to do personal work  I 
[01:34:00]  I  I  I  Oh please say he's going to go to Africa and adopt a kid  Please say it  He's just sitting there in silence  I think I got to welcome myself  This is what you're going to  Rehab! I'm going into rehab!  Takes care of everything though  But has he ever held a conversation before?  What are you going to do now? 
[01:34:30]  The vacuum?  Oh he could have got out of that  Because he could lie about the context of the video  He could say we was  He could say we was all  Do it  It was a half of a tape  That he  He qualified by saying that he was  He did what they're saying he did  He should have said  Look man  I  You know I didn't lose it  You know how I am  I'm nutty  That's why I am cream  That's why I got the part  I'm out of my mind 
[01:35:00]  And that didn't mean it like that  He could have got away with it  But this dummy  And that's another thing  Let me explain something to you  That  Sinbad  And  Michael Richards  And I'm not saying Sinbad is not black  But I'm saying  I'm saying that he's  These are the two most  Irrelevant  Racial guys  You will ever see  They  Neither one of them  Have ever talked about race  In their life  In public  Now they're in charge  Of this situation  And Dave Letterman  And none of these guys  Jerry Starnfel 
[01:35:30]  None of these guys  Talk about race  And they're making this  They're putting pressure  On Kramer  For what?  To give money  To some black cars  To the N.W.A.?  Come on man  Yeah  Who gives a  Cosmo's a racist  And now what?  Page two  What's next?  Yeah  All right  Here we go  I'm still wheeling from this  It's just been a few days  I don't know yet  Jerry  Is there anything  You want to say to Michael here? 
[01:36:00]  You know  I know Michael many years  And I know how he works on stage  And none of that  Justifies what happened  But you know  I've been talking to him today  And I just  I  He's someone that I love  And I  And I  I know how shattered  He is about this  And  And he deserves a chance  And that's why I wanted him to come on  He deserves a chance  To apologize  And that's all he wanted  And thank you for letting him  Oh my pleasure  Thank you very much 
[01:36:30]  Michael  I appreciate it  I know it's difficult  And I certainly hope  You don't have regrets  About being on this show  This evening  Thank you  All right  Take care  And then he just kind of  Sat there  Looking stupid  He is a dud  As a human  I will say this though  I respect Seinfeld  For bringing him on  Because I think that was  Partial season seven  The partial since the year  What's Seinfeld got to lose  In that situation  And Letterman handled it well  I mean Letterman  He was like a peacemaker  Yeah  You know  And yeah  Letterman  Letterman ate that up  You kidding  When he 
[01:37:00]  Do you think when Seinfeld  Walks up to Letterman  And goes  Hey I'm thinking about  You know  Maybe we get Michael  Yes  Onto the show  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Immediately  What  Not only do you get  Jerry Seinfeld  Who rarely goes on TV  These days  You get  Yeah  Michael Richards  You get the biggest story  In the news  Entertainment wise  And you're going to have  Both of the guys on  Hell yeah  You say yes  That's just like us  Going on Leno  Right  And they're going to put  Sinbad on stage  Without his shirt  And let Michael Richards  Yell at him  Give him a good scolding  Hey Anthony  What was your  I didn't hear what you  Thought 
[01:37:30]  Did you think he was racist  My whole take on it  Oh yeah  There's some racism  Bubbling  Under the surface there  And it just  Popped right out of his face  But  Well we were discussing  This earlier Patrice  We said you know  When you get into  A conversation  You really want  To go after someone  You go right for  The jugular  Right for the atom bomb  He doesn't know the guy  Maybe if he  If he knew that guy  And knew that perhaps  He was  Let's say he's  A deadbeat dad  He could have called  Him a deadbeat dad  If he knew  He did  Wait a minute though 
[01:38:00]  A friend  A comic  Who was on the show  That night  Gave me a call  And he was  I hadn't even heard about it  He's the one who told me about it  And he said  That the same dudes  Were in the audience  The day before  Messing up the show  Oh that's kind of  Like their gig  Like these guys  Were well hated  Serial hecklers  That's great  Michael Williams  Could have been like  Trying to be  The hero  To every comic 
[01:38:30]  Who had to deal  With these dudes  And the dude  Made me mad on the tape  Where he goes  That is uncalled for  That was unnecessary man  Yeah  And I was like  Dude  Let him do  What he gotta do  And the saddest thing  Is Michael Richards  Didn't get off stage  Until somebody called him  A used up  Has-been  Who can't get on  Movies  And who can't get  TV work  Yep  And that might be  Really the crust  Of it  Is that poor  Primer can't get a job  Yeah  And he's just  Mad at everybody dude  And now he's gotta 
[01:39:00]  Go on the apology tour  To have any  Shot with Hollywood  He's like  What did  What did Fred Mertz  Do after  I Love Lucy  He is the Fred Mertz  Of our time  He called  Louis Armstrong  A coon  In the middle  Of a cigarette commercial  On  What's his name  On the  Milton Berle show  Yeah I want to tell  Everybody to  Smoke Lucky Strikes  And I'm sorry  About what I said  Throwing a Lucky Strike  Come back  Hey  He had to go on 
[01:39:30]  Talk shows  And smoke cools  To prove that  He didn't mean it  Me and Desi  Used to hang out  He's a PR  He's one of the  Swarthy mud people  I think  You know  Light up a Lucky  And share it  With a black man  But just don't  Let him end lip it  Oh my god  It's just  Look man  It's news 
[01:40:00]  Because I guess  It needs to be  But if you ask  Black folks man  First of all  Half of them will go  Who's Kramer  Because barely  Anybody black  Watches Seinfeld  No black people  Don't like Seinfeld  We're not  Seinfeld  Not black people  Who would get  Emotional enough  To care  Like  Yeah  It's like  You know  I can't think of  A white show  Where if it came out  That somebody was  Racist on it  That we would all go  Oh my god  This changes everything  We ever thought  Kramer's not beloved  In the black community  It's like 
[01:40:30]  You know  You watch it  I mean  Thank god  I never watched it  Up until  Syndication  And thank you  For syndication  You know  I got a chance  To watch it  But when it was out  He's not beloved  He's beloved  To white people  Who can get to  Escape the fact  That they are racist  And that  Like  What is it going to  Take now  For people to know  That it's out there  Floating around  At least y'all  Talk about it  It's fun  You know  You do your thing  I mean  Anthony's really racist  But  At least  It's fun  To deal with  The fact  That you are racist 
[01:41:00]  I can have  An actual argument  With you  Or Norton  It's fun  It's like  I can argue  I can't argue  With these  White people  Who are now  Saddened  At Kramer  You know  What's it going to  Take for  Like there'll be  A blooper  Or something  One of the  Scooby-Doo  Characters  Saying it  By mistake  Or something  That would be  All real people  I thought  Casey Kasem  Made us understand  That these  Phony balonies  Are real  Yeah  Hey  You got something  Yeah  What is 
[01:41:30]  Here's what I wanted  To ask you  Why do black people  Not like me  When they're in the audience  Say that again  Why do black people  Not like me  I see  You know the look  I mean too  Because Norton  You look like  Somebody we shouldn't like  That's exactly  What it is  He's right  You are  First of all  You're bald  And you're  You're just white  And you know what it is  You look like somebody  That we all should be robbing  For prostitutes  But no  It is  And another thing  That bugs me about you 
[01:42:00]  Is every time  Somebody goes  Uh oh  Norton's getting mad  Watch out  I go  You can just put Norton  Inside of a wallet  And anger means nothing  So it's like  But black people  Look at you like  You represent  Things like  Okay you know  You represent Norton  To me  And not to me  But I'll tell you what  You represent the black folks  You represent  And this is why  I love white people  Being racist  Because I like to be  Mental  Because I  You know  I'm a big black guy 
[01:42:30]  So here's what  I've been dealing with  It's like  A white boy  That looks like Norton  When I was younger  Would call me that word  And then run  As I'm chasing him  With my hand around his throat  And then I go  Wait he called me this word  And then it doesn't matter  I get suspended from school  I get arrested  I get whatever  So I had to learn  How to deal with that  Norton represents  Like why black people  Look at Norton  And go  Ugh  If Norton represents  Somebody  Who they want to  Smack in the face  But has this attitude 
[01:43:00]  That he can't be touched  I.E.  Like  Kenny  Like somebody  Might go  Boy  Are you lucky  That big dude  Ain't with you  Man  I like to pop  You inside  Your little white head  But that is  That's what you represent  To  Just from looking at him  On the stage  Yeah  Well  Yeah  Because I knew  Part of it  Was the way  I present myself  On stage  Black people  With white performers  Or white comedians  They like it goofy  They like it silly  They don't like you  To have an attitude  About race  And then  Or an attitude  In general probably  They don't like it 
[01:43:30]  They don't like  An aggressive attitude  Yeah  They like an apologetic  Or silly attitude  They don't like  An aggressive attitude  They deal with  Empowered white people  And I even said  All the time  They don't want to do it  At a comedy club  I call Billy Burr  And ask him about  What it seems like  Because Billy does  Like you know  A lot of black rungs  He knows  But Billy gets love  And Voss gets love  You know  Right  So it's  Because they  I don't talk about  The black community  The way Billy and Voss do  I don't talk about it 
[01:44:00]  Like  I don't knock it either  But I don't talk about it  Like oh you gotta watch out  The sister's mad  I mean I'm not saying  That's all they do  But there's an attitude  Coming from that  That I don't have  Because I'm not up there  Trashing black people either  I'm talking about  There's something about  The way I talk  It reminds black people  Of something they don't like  And it's not something  I'm saying  You are somebody  That black people  Just  Instinctively  Don't like  It's just  You look like somebody  That black people  Shouldn't like  That's exactly what it is  You look like a 
[01:44:30]  A cop  That  A narc  That would get beat up  If he wasn't a cop  Like a  I don't look  You look like he would get beat up  If he wasn't a cop  But I don't think I would get beat up  I mean I'm a nice guy  Alright  Hey  But Patrice  While we have you on the phone  What do you think of the  Guard towers  Is going up in Harlem  I didn't hear about that  You haven't heard this  You'll see it on the news tonight  They're pretty much  Putting up guard towers  In Harlem  These things are  Like escape from New York  Yeah  Almost like escape from New York 
[01:45:00]  But if you look at these towers  Have you seen how they operate  They're on hydraulics  And they go to the ground  And the cops can get into this guard tower thing  And then they lift up  They almost look like the Imperial walkers  From Star Wars  They got a cop  And he gets in this thing  And then he rises up 20 feet  And it looks like a guard tower  And he checks out the scene  Because he can see  You know  He can see a lot further  And stuff  They got cameras  When the guy's not in the thing  And then if there's some kind of  Something happening on the ground 
[01:45:30]  He lowers the thing  And then he can jump into action  Yeah  Those are the things from RoboCop  That they made to try to kill RoboCop  But the reason that's going to be in the hood  From what you're saying  Is because white people live in Harlem now  It's damn near white  Starbucks  It's a beautiful place  I told you Harlem  Ain't what it used to be  Yeah Harlem used to be really really black  For the rest of the country  But it's  It's beautiful right now  To make sure that white people 
[01:46:00]  Ain't getting beat  Clinton did that  Bill Clinton did that  Yeah he's got an office up there  He said  I get in my office  I'm putting it in Harlem  Great  And a bunch of developers  Came in behind him  And started rebuilding  All these historic buildings  And white people started coming up  And visiting the tourist attractions  And now  They've got to put guard towers up  To protect these poor bastards  Patrice always has the angle  It's because the white people  Are starting to live up there  Where were these magical robots  In 20 years  Magical robots  Here's the story 
[01:46:30]  I bet you wait  I bet you  Those robots  The robots shut down  After 140th  Automatically there's a chip in them  Alright here's the story  It's only 20 seconds  The NYPD is hoping a new eye in the sky  Can help them cut crime  On city streets  The Skywatch  On West 129th Street in Harlem  Is a two story tower  According to the New York Post  It has a look out booth  For a cop  There's also four cameras  Visual sensors  And a high powered spotlight  To zone in on criminal activity  The city has already installed cameras 
[01:47:00]  On city buses  And subway stations  It's a guard tower  Yeah  It's got the spotlight  And everything  That's right man  There's a  I think there's like a latte place  Right on 125th  And Frederick Douglass  And they'll be changing  Those names pretty soon too  No more Adam Clayton Boulevard  No more Frederick Douglass  It'll be a nice  Whatever  Whatever white people mean  You know  Fred McMurray Boulevard  Cosmo Kramer Street  Cosmo  There's the joke  Cosmo  Lucille Ball  William Frawley Boulevard

[01:49:30]  To some degree  Alright Patrice  We gotta take a break  Thank you so much  Alright thanks man  Bye sweetie  XM show this Saturday night  With Patrice O'Neal  9 to midnight  It's a relationship show  It's really funny  Absolutely  Patrice's disgusting  Take on relationships  Which actually  He's really good at it  And I hate to admit that  But he really has a good take on it  So it's a great show  Alright  We gotta talk about  The O.J. real fast  We gotta talk about  Most Dangerous Toys  For 06  Yeah O.J. never apologized  Why did he go out  Every last night  And grovel for a little while  No kidding  We got the  Nazi gingerbread house 
[01:50:00]  This is what we'll do next  It's the O.N.A. virus  Spreading across America  It's the 2006 homeless shopping spree  Only on the O.P. and Anthony show  Coming soon to a snooty mall  Maybe one near you  The O.P. and Anthony show  Will bring a busload of homeless degenerates  Shopping for Christmas presents  And you of course are invited to watch  And shop along  Golden Buns is gonna get busy 
[01:50:30]  Immerse yourself in a time honored tradition  Enjoy the holiday spirit  And the stench of booze and vomit  As we partake in another homeless shopping spree  On the O.P. and Anthony show  It's the O.P. and Anthony show  It's the O.P. and Anthony show  On XM 202  What else is happening today?  By the way this is the O.P. and Anthony show  Music on the program 
[01:51:00]  Huh?  Program  I hate the word program  It's like the 50s  Showgram  How about showgram?  Showgram?  That's what grandma's always used to call the soap operas  I gotta watch my programs  My cereal  Or my stories  My cereals, yeah  Yeah, my cereals  Well, Fox wimped out  They bailed on the O.J. book  And the special  Under pressure  Not from the general public 
[01:51:30]  That loves peering in on this crap  The trial itself  Got more viewers than any other trial  It made things like Court TV  They were nothing before that  And people want to see this  Yeah  Regardless of how tasteless  Disgusting it is  People want to see it  There's a market for it  It's changing  It's kind of scary  I mean, the media used to be all about controversy  They used to jump on things like this  Yeah  But, man, it is changing out there 
[01:52:00]  What were they worried about?  The advertisers?  Yes  Banning Fox News Channel  And everything else they have their hands in?  I love to  I've said this all the time  I love to see one company ride out a boycott  Yeah  A threat of a boycott  Absolutely  Because it never seems to happen  They threaten and say  We're gonna boycott  Unless you do this  We're gonna boycott  And then they always cave in  I want to see what would happen  And go, okay, boycott  Well, Walmart  I don't know what the effect was 
[01:52:30]  But last year  Now Walmart's using the term Christmas again  Which I'm glad to see  Because I hate the political correctness of it  Yeah  Because I think last year  The Catholic League boycotted them  I don't know what effect it had  But I guess it had some effect  Because they're Midwestern  Because they're starting to say  Merry Christmas  Good, they should  Yeah  You know what is interesting?  O.J.'s ready to talk  O.J.'s ready to say some things  You know what's gonna happen?  This is gonna end up on the internet  Yeah  And this isn't the internet of five years ago  People are gonna be like  All right  You're able to download it  Right on 
[01:53:00]  And see it  And it's there  Yeah  It's on YouTube  And they're charging me five bucks to see this  I'm in  Television and radio are just you dummies  You're digging your own graves  You don't understand how irrelevant you're becoming  The more restrictions that are put on broadcast mediums  The more people realize the freedoms they have on the internet  Yeah  And the stuff that's available there  And you know regular radio and regular TV 
[01:53:30]  They didn't you know five years ago  Ah the internet stop  Yeah remember  People worry about it when it's actually a competition  Well guess what  It's here  And it's happening  And O.J.'s ready to talk  And that's where he's gonna go next  He's gonna go  All right  Someone make me a deal  I'm ready  I'm ready  I'll tell you everything I was gonna tell you on Fox News Channel  Or Fox or whatever  I think someone else will pick up the book  I hope so  Tell you the truth  I'd love to hear his account of the murder  Excuse me  Wouldn't you like to hear O.J.'s account of the murder?  Sure 
[01:54:00]  Even if it's silly  Stop  Even if it's filled with cute anecdotes about football  I probably would've ran  And if you did a little football anecdotes  It's not silly  I did the Hasman Trophy pose  It is the confession with some names changed  That's what it is  Yeah  It's absolutely the way he killed those people  And who doesn't want to read that?  Of course you do  You'll get a few on the phones  Ah I think they did the right thing  Most people want to see this thing  And you know of course they parade out the families of the victims 
[01:54:30]  They're not gonna be into it  But they have a little personal interest in this not being released  And O.J. not getting any publicity  But not as a, you know, maybe it is  I was gonna say not as like a gawker  Or some kind of a morbid curiosity  But it really is a morbid curiosity  But it's also, this has been going on for so long  And the case is so old  That you really want to hear it now  From the horse's ass  You want to hear how he did this 
[01:55:00]  What happened  If there were any inconsistencies  With the evidence that was presented  If he's gonna go the whole other way  And just make it total BS  Or if he's gonna follow what really happened  And go, wow, you know  The prosecution pretty much had everything spelt out right  But now, now what?  Gotta wait?  That ain't happening  He's gonna lie  He's just doing this for money  But he obviously wanted to talk about something  And they should have let him  Yeah  I'd like to see him broadcasting again  To be honest with you  I'd love, I'd watch every game he  Especially when he said 
[01:55:30]  You gotta slash left and cut right  Cut right  And all he did was murder analogies  The old days, they would have hired him  He would have been on that field  Oh boy, he almost took his head off  I know what that's like  Do you, O.J.  Let's go to Chris in Arizona  Chris  Hey, what's up, O.J.?  Hey, Chris  Hey, uh, you talk about the O.J. thing  Why don't you guys bring him on the virus  You know, so we can save you  We'd love to have O.J. on the show  We'd love to have O.J. on, dude 
[01:56:00]  O.J. has an open invitation  Alright, where's Roland?  Where's Roland?  Roland, book Orenthal James Simpson  Immediately  We'd love to get O.J. on  I'd love to hear Roland say Orenthal  Where's, but let's get Roland in here  Yeah, we're getting Roland  Orenthal Roland  We've got to get this on  People are going to kill us  The Nazi gingerbread house story from earlier  It's a cute Christmas story  Oh, but first Roland  Roland  Oh boy  It's like our first holiday story  Ladies and gentlemen, the showstopper  Hey, Roland, how are you?  Alright  Preemptive 
[01:56:30]  Can you say O.J.'s real name?  James Orenthal Simpson  Orenthal  Yeah, J.O. Simpson  J.O. Simpson  Okay, that's actually accurate  Yeah, well  So can we get O.J. on?  He's doing no press at all  They pull the book, I believe  But they pull the book, so who cares?  I don't care what he's plugging  We'd like to have him on the show  Yeah, you call your people  So he can kind of discuss  What might have been in the book  Things like that 
[01:57:00]  And maybe get some more interest  From another company  Yeah  Yeah  Okay  Go work the O.J. angle  Work the O.J. angle  Alright  What's his full name?  James Orenthal Simpson  J.O. Simpson  J.O. Simpson  Isn't it?  I always thought it was  The other way around  Yeah, I don't know  Why would you say that?  O.J.  And just a little observation  From me to you  Do you own every t-shirt  From Lucky Brand?  I don't know  I guess  Lucky's very popular  Which favorite show? 
[01:57:30]  JB and the Bear?  H.A.  Roland loves the Lucky Brand t-shirts  They're comfortable  You got every single one  And he smells like  I can smell you from here  You vanilla fairy  He smells like vanilla  I want to hug Roland  Give him a hug, Jimmy  Alright  Oh, look  Jimmy's walking over to Roland  He did a little hug  Jimmy put his foot up  Got a little whiff  How'd it feel?  It's a little too much today 
[01:58:00]  He has like a little  Too much  Is it?  Yeah, it's just a very strong  I like the smell though  I say that he put a little  Too much in the laundry  This time  It's a vanilla scented thing  He went through the whole thing  With me  He washes it  He puts  What are you covering up?  It's like you walk past  A Yankee candle  In the mall  Whenever Roland comes in the room  A Yankee candle  What the hell is that?  Yankee candle?  Alright, Roland  Get out of here  Don't burn me at both ends  Nazi gingerbread house story  UF  Well, an Ohio community 
[01:58:30]  Is up in arms  Over a disturbing  Holiday window display  Shocked residents say  A local artist went too far  Take a look  It shows gingerbread men  Dressed up as Nazis  Saluting a gingerbread Hitler  Many who saw the display  Were appalled  And demanded it be taken down  Hungry  The store's owner now says  He will remove it  The artist says  He wanted to provoke thought  Not offend anything  Alright, sure, some people  Were appalled as they saw it  But what about the people  That kind of chuckled  And said  Oh my God  Look at that 
[01:59:00]  Nazi gingerbread guys  And they have little  Jewish gingerbread people  You can eat  Why not?  If you're on a diet  Wow  I want to apologize, Jerry  I, uh  Against  You know, I am not racist  Against gingerbread people  Jerry  Gingerbread people  Lunatic  That guy's just an ass  But you gotta love him  He's got balls  Why couldn't the artist  Offend people? 
[01:59:30]  You know what?  Being offensive is okay sometimes  I don't know why  It has become  Against the law  To offend  To offend  You're allowed  You can't incite  You can offend  You can say things  That people don't agree with  And don't find pleasant  That is well within your rights  Without having to make an excuse  Or anything like that  You'll have to pay the consequences  Uh-huh  And a lot of people  The only reason they apologize 
[02:00:00]  Is to try to not pay those consequences  And keep their careers rolling  But it's not a law  You're not cast out  Jesus  I'm so touchy  You're sweet  We gotta get the owner of this place  On the radio  Are you trying to get him?  We'd love to talk to this guy  That would be good  I heard he's banned from the place, huh?  What?  Michael Richards  Banned from the Laugh Factory  Oh really?  Yeah  Oh no, no  I'm talking about the other guy  Gingerbread man 
[02:00:30]  Oh, that guy  I thought you were talking about  Laugh Factory guy  We're trying to get him  He said he would call the show today  But uh  He's probably doing other press  Yeah, it must be busy  They're doing like press  Right from the Laugh Factory  With the nice logo  Right in the back  Yeah, you're gonna want that  Banned from the Laugh Factory?  I heard that last night  That's stupid  That's kind of banned  That would be stupid  Yeah  Well maybe he's afraid  Of some kind of retribution  From physical  Knowing  Knowing Jamie a little bit  Not only is he not banned  He's gonna be headlining  The New York Club  For the whole month of December 
[02:01:00]  You think he's like  Kind of digging this in a way  Jamie needs a little help  At the Laugh Factory  In New York  And some publicity  It's kind of nice  If Jamie could  He would give him a month run  At the Laugh Factory  In New York  He don't care  Jamie doesn't care  Month run  List of racial backgrounds  Of people in the audience  Like the most diverse audience ever  That was the worst apology  I've ever seen  Yeah  It was groveling  And embarrassing  And just disingenuous  And all over the place  Arba Dwyer 
[02:01:30]  Had a better apology  Absolutely  Why don't you just pull  A whoopee cushion  Out of the bag  And sit on it  You jackass  Hey Kat in Jersey  Has more on that story  Yeah we gotta get  Gingerbread man on the show  These are the type of people  We need to talk to  Right  Kat what's up  Hey guys  I read that last year  The same artist  Did a window display  Of a kid with a chemistry set  Making meth  Oh really  Gingerbread meth lab  Meth lab  My first meth lab  Exactly  So the guy apparently  Does this every year  Makes these outrageous 
[02:02:00]  Politically incorrect  Gingerbread scenes  Well I don't think  It was gingerbread last year  But there's another one too  If I find it  I'll send it in  But the guy's got a sense  Of humor  And people don't  So  Alright  Well the Nazi thing  You could see it  Kind of offending  Somebody maybe  Strolling by  They see a scene  From Nuremberg  Played out in gingerbread  That might upset  Some people  Yeah we understand that  And I want to add  A little asterisk here  About the  Michael Richardson  I watched Seinfeld  Segment last night  Not to be lost 
[02:02:30]  He was damn funny  Talking about kids  Him and Letterman  Had a thing with  Being a father  And none of it was  Corn  It was really funny  Yeah  That's what sucks  No one's going to remember  What Seinfeld said  It really bugged me  How funny he was  About his kids  I was like god damn it  He's really good  Yeah because right  After the apology  He was like  Well it's going to be  Easy to seg back  Into the funny  And thank god  They took a break  Came back  And then just  Went back into it  But yeah  It was pretty funny  About his kids  And everything  Yeah  Great  How do you say  He takes the little  Heads off them  As play-doh figures  And leaves them in the bed 
[02:03:00]  There's like a mafia warning  I was  Shuckling like a fat housewife  Enjoying that  I'm a house frowl  Also  Every year  You get the list  Of the most dangerous toys  Yeah around this time  Christmas  Boy toys  They'll kill your kids  Very dangerous  Do we remember  The toys we grew up with  The worst toys ever  No safety  They didn't have to  Run past anyone  Someone had an idea  For a toy  It got made  It got sold  Absolutely  Remember the toy  You played with  When you were a kid 
[02:03:30]  My favorite  Was the uncle's penis  I can't get that anymore  Is this part of your  Yes you can  Is this part of your  Therapy  There was a toy  When I was growing up  There were a few  One was called  The Uncle Fester  Lightbulb  Ew  It was  Because Uncle Fester  And the Adams family  Used to put a lightbulb  In his mouth  And it would light up  So it was this thing  It had a battery in it  But you had to put  A piece of tin foil  Under your tongue  For the contacts  To connect 
[02:04:00]  So first of all  Tin foil in your mouth  Isn't a good idea  In case it hits a tooth  Or filling  Or something like that  It'll hurt  Secondly  Talk about a choking hazard  Alright kids  Now tear off a small  Piece of tin foil  Fold it up  And put it under your tongue  Then there were  Incredible edibles  Where you poured  Some type of chemical  That God knows what it was  Into a metal mold  Hold on  And baked it at 800 degrees  Hold on  Everyone knows  Incredible edibles  What amazes me today  Is that you remember  The Uncle Fester  Mystery lightbulb 
[02:04:30]  From 1967  Was that from 67?  How do you remember  This crap?  I remember the basic toys  From my youth  Oh that one  I remember that  The James Bond  Briefcase  That shot out  Little things  Six finger  Where you put  It was an extra finger  That you put  Between your middle finger  And your ring finger  And it shot darts out  Like pointy darts  And by the way  No suction cups  When we were kids  By the way 
[02:05:00]  If we're going to be  Talking about  Dangerous toys  The king  Of dangerous toys  The lawn darts  Lawn darts  Lawn darts  We're going to loft  These giant darts  In the air  Practically out of view  And when they come down  What do you do?  The greatest part was  It was these two circles  And you stood  Behind your circle  And your brother  In my case  Would stand behind  His circle  And try to get  Your dart  In the circle  But then that game  Got boring  Didn't it?  So now it was time  To put brother 
[02:05:30]  In the circle  As you threw  The lawn darts  Who could get  Closer to the foot  Without actually  Having to take him  To the hospital  Right  And by the way  Can I say  That the most  Dangerous toy  Because you remember  When you were a kid  And you'd get  And you'd get  The easy bake oven  And you'd put  Your underpanties on  And when you didn't  Bake it right  The man would hit you  Does anybody else remember?  The little plastic man  Would come out  And punch you in the eye  And take the little oven  That's off my hand  Click clacks  Were just brutal  Big glass beads 
[02:06:00]  About the size of golf balls  On the end of strings  And you would just  Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick  And they would go further  And further apart  As they gained more energy  Hitting each other  Until it went over the top  And that was the trick  To get it to bounce  On top and the bottom  And go  Clack, clack, clack, clack, clack, clack  As you waved your hand around  And when they shattered  It was like some kind of  Anti-personnel device going off  What about it just  Hitting you in the temple? 
[02:06:30]  That's another one  Yeah, when it would  Wrap around your wrist  And one side would do that  And the other side  Would just knock you in the nose  Or you'd dip  In confectionery sugar  And hand them to your  Retarded friend  Alright, let's  Here's this year's  Most dangerous toys  This year  Toys with super soakers  That are super fast  Shoot super high  And are even shaped as  Superman  Seem to be anything but  Well, super  Super?  Oh  It's a problem each year  Toys with dangerous parts  Find their way onto store shelves  Last year alone 
[02:07:00]  Twenty kids died  From injuries  Caused by their toys  Alright, listen  Hmm  Socks for the families  Yeah, it can't be  Twenty lousy kids  Twenty lousy kids  But it is  We're sacrificing fun  To get perfect stats  Yeah  What are we going for?  None kids  Hurt by toys?  It's never gonna happen  But in the meantime  You're taking our fun away  A kid could get killed  Probably has been killed  By a Nerf football  At some point  In Nerf's existence  I'm sure it hit his temple right 
[02:07:30]  And something happened  You're never gonna get down to zero  Twenty though?  Twenty  I say we're doing  A pretty damn good job  How many toys are sold  Every year?  It'd be funny  If it was only thirty  Oh  Yeah  And that is pretty dangerous  Ten lucky kids  That didn't die  I want to invent  A super soaker  That encourages the kid  To drink out of the tip  Of the thing  And yet he has to put  His toe on the trigger  And squirt it  And the juice goes  In his mouth  Why are we obsessed  As I think  Americans in general 
[02:08:00]  Trying to save every kid  A hundred percent  It's impossible  I think twenty kids  God bless  That's awesome  Only twenty kids died  But there's always  Going to be  The little kid  That pulls on the TV  And it falls on him  TVs aren't always  Going to be safe  Everything  Never going to be  A hundred percent  I don't mind them  Raising awareness  If something happens  Like you're like  Oh my god  We do need to fix that  Because that happens  But then the panic  And then wreck it  For everybody  Who knows better  Yeah  Parts find their way 
[02:08:30]  Onto store shelves  Last year alone  Twenty kids died  From injuries  Caused by their toys  That's enough  Strangulation  Small parts  Choking hazards  Had the potential  To cause brain injury  And death  So the kinds of hazards  We're talking about  Are not small things  We're not talking about  Cuts and scrapes  And bruises  According to consumer advocates  These ten topped  This year's list  As the worst toys  This pyramid stacker  With a sharp pointy top  And solid wood dowel  If a toddler falls on it  They risk blunt force trauma 
[02:09:00]  A punji steak  Just give a little  Pungji steak to a kid  Can't that happen  With every toy out there  You fall on it  You fall on it  You fall on a Tonka tow truck  Right  Have the hook  Go right through you  It's dangerous  Take it away  Force trauma  This superman lamp  That needs to be plugged in  Puts kids in danger  Of an electric shock  Doesn't every lamp  Have to be plugged in  You dope  Excuse me  It's electric  It's the superman lamp  If you want it to light up  There's a little straw  Sticking off it  You have to blow into  Danger of an electric shock 
[02:09:30]  The zippity-doo dolly  With detachable buttons  And fear factor candy  That challenges children  To eat as much as possible  What is the zippity-doo dolly  What a cute name  What is that  A pillow for your kid to bite  I like the zippity-doo dolly  Mother  Here bite this fairy  That one should be banned  Just cause of the name  The zippity  Do you know what that is Kev  The zippity-doo dolly  Never heard of it  No  See  The zippity-doo dolly  And fear factor candy  That challenges children 
[02:10:00]  To eat as much as possible  In as fast as possible  Both choking hazards  This pram decoration  And this little snoopy  Both have long strings  That a baby could get tangled in  And strangled by  What?  And of course  The sky blaster  The water balloon launcher  And the old-fashioned bow and arrow  If hurled the wrong way  Could blind a child  Oh shit  Put an eye out  I hear that footwear made the list  With wheels and the heels  Becoming so popular  It's important to point out  That one child in Massachusetts  Died wearing them  Another in New Jersey 
[02:10:30]  Is seriously injured  So don't buy the super-duper hype  Instead use these toys  As an example  To detect similar hazards  On the gifts you pick  All right  How many kids use  Those rolly sneaker things?  I want to invent  Something called  The dippity-doo  Crush glass surprise  With a kid  It's shaped like a sneaker  But it's all crushed glass  So when the baby  Puts his foot in it  He's stepping in broken glass  That might not pass  Here's the candy thing 
[02:11:00]  It's a piece of silly string  And it's like a little doll  You have to open the trench coat  And you grab the silly string  And it's okay  It doesn't hurt  I want to invent  Some real fun toys for kids  Just give them a ball  At this point  Let them bounce it  Look at each other  Like we suck  There you go  We're poor, sorry  There's our music  Oh well  Aw, we're all through  On this side  Yeah  That Kramer stuff  Took up a lot of time  That was fun  Sure did  It's a huge story today though  Ah, ah  The Stalker Patty facial video

I'm sure I'll say  Hey, New Year's Eve  I'll be appearing at  Kill the O.B. and Anthony Show  Stupid Bill  Kiss his lips  Bill  Not now  Now  O.B. and Anthony 
[02:20:00]  XM202  They are the most  Vile, despicable human beings  In the country  Creeps  Engel biters  Obviously the strength  Is their ability  To turn mistruth  Into something people would believe  Wow, how long  Is this guy going to continue to babble  And say nothing?  All day long  Shut up  All right, here we go  Welcome to the O.B. and Anthony Show  It's worse than I imagined 
[02:20:30]  That's terrible  I'm sorry  We are a bunch of dopes  I think we're lewd  We're probably pushing 20 arrests  Because of this radio show  Out of touch  Cornwall  Three retards  We have the effect of  Palenol PM  O.B.  You know I could have been a model  Anthony  I'm dead  James Norton  I like yogurt  Robert Reed  But enough of this palaver 
[02:21:00]  Let's get the show on the road  mental Video  And it's just out there  If we aren't at the blue  Just do help  And they can kind of  And food  Third  Cool  And  All right 
[02:21:30]  Oh  Get set  Yeah  B  All right  And  Help  And  You know  A  Get set  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:22:30]  You know, because a lot of people don't hear the show live when we do it.  They hear it on a replay or whatever.  But the word gets out there through the message boards and the fans that, oh, my God, Opie and Anthony did something a little different and unusual today.  So then everyone gets really excited that didn't hear the bit to hear the bit during the replay.  And last night, just at the point where we were going to do the Stalker Patty Bukkake video, it went to Patrice from last week. 
[02:23:00]  Danny forgot to do some coding thing.  And he fucked up.  So then everyone started writing and saying that XM is censoring the Opie and Anthony show.  It was just an unfortunate thing.  Danny fucked up.  They instantly go into speculation and rumor mode.  Where they're like, yeah, fucking guys in D.C. must not have liked the segment.  Something happened and it was too much.  You know, those fucking guys, you're supposed to be able to let them do whatever they want. 
[02:23:30]  Hey, calm down.  Slow down.  Right.  So we're going to make good today.  We're going to rerun the Stalker Patty segment, which means, yes, we'll be leaving early today.  Nothing to do with censorship.  The fact is, Danny's just an incompetent dub.  I mean, we love Danny, but he's dumb.  He's a good boy.  Yeah.  He's got a good heart.  He's stupid.  Dumb as dirt.  So we're going to redo that today.  All right.  For the people that missed it. 
[02:24:00]  I got so many phone calls.  I got some phone calls from the Philly crew.  You're like, dude, I was telling everybody about this today.  And they're all listening on the replay and it's not there.  I'm like, what?  My father called me and he goes, he didn't know what it was called.  He goes, what's that?  The Bukami, the stuff that me and you did?  Bukami.  Oh.  Did your mom?  No, I edited it before I went there because I don't even listen to the show.  I heard the phone calls again on the replay yesterday.  Very uncomfortable to listen to. 
[02:24:30]  Very uncomfortable.  You were listening today.  Eye contact.  Eye contact.  I told her you were kidding.  Yeah, dad, I was.  Kidding.  Once again, though, the video is going to, I think it might turn into a YouTube sensation today.  The Starker Patty facial video.  We didn't call it Bukkake because they would probably yank the video.  So it's called Starker Patty facial.  The link is up on opiananthony.com under the featured video section. 
[02:25:00]  Enjoy.  I'm hungry, Kenny.  What would you like?  Veggies?  And we got a meeting after show today.  Egg whites and veggies.  Okay, Anthony.  Please.  I'm good, thank you.  Jimmy?  I'll write it down.  A lot of people saying that Danny should be punished.  I think he should be punished.  What type of punishment should be handed down?  It is like a ship.  Mete it out.  We should have discipline.  That's exactly it.  People walking.  Spankings.  A bare bottom spanking administered by all of our warm hands. 
[02:25:30]  Maybe you should knock his face with your cock.  Jimmy, you should punish.  Not give him and my both a reward.  Jimmy, I'm going to give you my turn.  What?  You can have my turn.  You can have my spanks.  Okay.  Because I know you would enjoy it.  Oh, the paddle.  Danny.  Wow, that is a real like...  A lot of people are saying you should be punished.  I agree with them.  That's a fraternity paddle.  Jesus.  It's not a punishment if you're going to enjoy it.  You're not going to enjoy it, but I mean...  You're not going to enjoy it. 
[02:26:00]  It was my fucker.  A lot of people are saying you should be punished.  I agree with that.  I agree, yes.  As he's pulling his pants down already.  Danny's kneeling with his mouth open.  Go ahead, boys.  Use it for whatever you feel is necessary.  Time to make another Bukkake video.  At this time, we use the real stuff.  Right, Danny?  Sure.  Oh, yeah.  It's the big paddle from the game Bully.  That would hurt.  Yeah, it certainly would.  That would really hurt.  Especially if we rammed it up his ass.  That'd be great.  I want Kenny to paddle him. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, boy.  What?  How about we use the razor and just take a divot out of his head?  What the hell's wrong with you?  What razor?  We got the clippers.  The electric clippers?  Oh, the electric clippers.  And give him one of those, like, jackass...  That's a jackass thing, though.  Well, how about just...  Let's draw a penis in his hair.  We give him a good hairdo.  A fancy hairdo.  I do need one.  Let me see your hair.  How about a fucking...  How about a good...  How about a bowl cut for Danny? 
[02:27:00]  Oh, my God.  Remember the hair do I had that day?  How about...  The Jimmy hair.  Can we make you bald from ear to ear?  Just one fucking lane across the top.  No, from...  Like his...  Like his headphones had fucking radiation.  Absolutely.  Really?  Sure.  Who knows how to do that shit?  Where's Earl when we need him?  Earl's the guy, but anyone could work fucking clippers.  I would hope someone in here could work a set of clippers.  Just from ear to the top of the head, back down to the other ear. 
[02:27:30]  I'd be afraid to have one ball strip.  That'll come right off.  Yeah, you know.  Was Minnelli complaining over there?  Why?  I don't know.  I just saw you guys all talking.  I was making sure he wasn't...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Giving me a grief.  No, he's giving me...  No, Minnelli's all about help.  I mean with me.  Not complaining about the show, but me.  Is he complaining about me?  He doesn't really...  Me?  He doesn't really see how you fit in with the show, so...  All right.  Well, I'll talk about it.  But don't worry about it.  No, no.  That's fine.  Dude, I heard today on...  It was exactly four minutes into the show. 
[02:28:00]  Opie said...  About time.  They should rotate the third mic.  You'll be guys bringing the funny.  First of all, let me tell you something.  If you're on a message board and you've ever written the words bring the funny, like in  that term, bringing the funny, like the Tom Cruise movie, you're a fucking fat girl.  I'll bring the big black dildo for your mom's ass.  You bring the funny.  Yeah, why don't you bring the shotgun and then bring your mouth and put it in there because  you're fucking an awful writer. 
[02:28:30]  Bring the funny.  Just those words together.  Well, we would have had a perfect show if it wasn't for Norton.  Three dumps today, Mr. Norton.  Yeah, well, sorry.  It's not my fault that they're self-destructing over there.  I'd say what?  Nigger twice and uncle's penis, right?  Yeah.  Fucking babies.  Jesus, they're so predictable.  You got it.  You got it.  All right, how are we going to do Danny's hair?  Who's an expert on electric clippers?  First, where are the clippers?  Yes.  How about Steve?  Sam. 
[02:29:00]  Well, is Shirley Feeney going to mind his new haircut?  Dude, it's got to go from ear to ear.  Yeah.  Over the top.  Just like the headphones, where the headphones go.  So you look like one of those African tribesmen.  Yeah.  We get painted up with green paint from a rock.  Who could do this for us?  Who's good at this shit?  You don't even have to be good.  Yeah, I think anybody can.  I say Sam would do a good job.  Well, Sam is on the camera, though.  Who's going to operate the camera?  He's kind of almost black. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Barber shop.  Like, yeah.  The barber shop.  All right, Danny.  Take your headphones off.  You understand what we're doing, right, Sam?  Yeah.  Take a look at where the headphones go, though.  That's exactly.  From ear to ear.  Up over the top.  Oh.  That's great.  What?  I use one every day.  Yeah, but you know how it works, right?  That's right, Jimmy.  I just want to watch it.  You know how it works.  I just want to watch him rip his skin tone.  All you got to do is lightly touch it to his scalp, and then just slowly drag it over 
[02:30:00]  the top of his head, and you're in.  That is like a big fucking horse one.  Danny, you have no problem with this?  You didn't fuck up that bad.  Jesus.  No, I mean, I was only growing it for Halloween, so I just got lazy and never went to get a  hair cut.  I mean, like, for the horsemen.  You can defend yourself.  It wasn't that bad of a fuck up.  Talk him out of it.  He actually made the bit more important.  Wait, what's that sound like?  So consider this a reward.  Thank you. 
[02:30:30]  It'd be funny if as soon as he heard that, Danny just instinctively pulled his pants down  and bent over.  Instead of Iraq doing it?  Iraq's on his knees laying out papers.  Somebody usually bleed from this, Eric.  The face he just gave you.  They're the subtle little faces of Iraq.  It's complete disgust expressed in a fraction of a second.  It's a talent.  Sam, you're going to do this, huh?  You found one? 
[02:31:00]  Yeah, I found one.  All right, let's roll this.  This might get, like, 250 views on YouTube.  Yeah, it's something like that.  Dan gets a haircut.  Just one.  Why are you putting him closer to me?  Because there's a little...  All right, stand corrected.  No, he's shaving his asshole hairs.  I don't like head hair.  Jesus.  You know what's funny about YouTube?  We're all hoping for that breakout video.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  These guys are, like, filming video as soon as we go home.  Why can't we be that, like, that lying sack of shit teen girl? 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, right?  That was exposed.  Lonely girl?  Lonely girl.  I want to...  How do you get to lonely girl status?  I want to be lonely Opie.  Just lonely Opie?  Yeah.  You are.  I'm not.  I'm not lonely anymore.  I'm quite happy.  And then you would, like, just film yourself in your room?  Yeah, I'll make believe I'm lonely Opie.  Here's my pile of clothes.  Look, I gotta make this fast because my parents are downstairs, but...  Yeah.  Oh, is she faking like she needed friends?  Yeah, she was an actress.  You haven't seen Lonely Girl on YouTube? 
[02:32:00]  I got hooked into watching some of those.  I watched, like, two episodes and then the jig was up.  It was...  I want to apologize, Jerry.  Sorry about the jig being up.  Let's say hi to Doug out, Doug.  Doug!  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, better now, Doug.  By the way, Doug will be in the eggnog drinking contest.  We're still waiting for Whackbag to try to figure out who they're going to pick.  I say long shot, Doug.  By the way, I did this yesterday because I know Whackbag will now self-destruct trying  to figure out who they're going to bring to the eggnog drinking contest because I left 
[02:32:30]  it up to them to figure it out.  Watch them fight and just completely self-destruct now.  They'll send, like, someone skinny over...  And they can't send...  And Pat from Menachee's already in, so you can't send him, Whackbaggers.  You've got to decide amongst yourself who is going to represent Whackbag in the eggnog  drinking contest 10 days from today.  I drank a half a gallon of eggnog last night just for fun in an hour.  Really?  I love eggnog.  I realized it last week.  I was drinking eggnog. 
[02:33:00]  I'm like, I love this shit.  Your shits must be a soupy disaster.  I love it.  Just a pile of fucking wet shit with no structure.  It's like a fucking soft serve on a wet cracker.  By the way, for the eggnog drinking contest, I think we need to have one of our guys represent  the show.  Wow.  For a little show pride, Danny.  I have some pride.  I'm already having my punishment.  All right.  All right.  What do you want, Doug?  Hey, I got a great idea for the punishment for Danny, which, you know, I would love to  see Danny punished if he fucked me out of the iBook, if you would say. 
[02:33:30]  I would like to see Danny do his own Bukkake video as punishment.  His own?  Like he stands on his head and jerks off on his face?  No, dump the stuff on his face and post it on YouTube.  That could be funny, actually.  This could be funny, too, if it's done right.  He's going to look like a tribesman from the bush.  Love you, Danny.  Botswana.  All right.  Hey, Doug, what do you think of the Stalker Patty video?  I thought it was fucking hilarious. 
[02:34:00]  Yeah.  By the end, it's really funny.  It starts out kind of gross and funny, but then it gets really funny.  It was a great contrast, having Lady Di in there and how she's gotten completely old,  but Stalker Patty just never gets old.  No, Stalker Patty continues to give.  You know what's good about the Stalker Patty video, too?  We, we, it starts out with, I mean, it looks like fucking huge loads of jizz hitting her  in the face.  And then it gets ridiculous with other stuff.  And then you see like a total box gets thrown in her head. 
[02:34:30]  And then just when you think it's over, like throwing all kinds of other shit on, there's  one more shot where Obie goes like, oh, oh, and you just see this purplish, whitish jizz  hit her in the face.  And it's such a huge quantity and a perfect target, perfect landing right on her nose.  And it just flies all over her face.  Right.  And it's the last shot.  That's the one that went in her ear and up her nose.  The video is just terrific.  It's in my ear.  Shut up. 
[02:35:00]  Go to opianathlete.com, featured videos, Stalker Patty's facial.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  Bye.  We'll see you at the eggnog drinking contest in 10 days.  All right, Sam, you ready?  Sure.  All right.  Danny kind of fucked up.  By the way, the Stalker Patty Bukkake bit from yesterday will be at the end of today's  show and replay all day long.  How long of a bit is it?  Like 40 minutes.  Ha ha ha.  All right.  So now, um...  Why are we punishing Danny for giving us an early day, by the way?  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  Are you starting at one ear?  I don't think so.  Yeah.  Sam, you've never done this before, huh?  No, I've never used one of these before.  Now, where are you going to end up in the middle of his head?  Do you have an idea?  We'll go from here.  Do a dry run without it on.  Yeah.  You should just start right on the ear.  It won't hurt him.  Right?  Yeah.  Oh, he'll pull the ear down a little.  Right.  So you're going to...  Turn your eye towards it, Dan.  Smart move.  So you're going to go like that.  Straight over the top.  And then you've got to switch to the other side.  But now you've got to, like, you know, the two railroads meeting up in the middle. 
[02:36:00]  Right.  You've got to make sure the tracks are aligned before we drive a spike through his head.  Can we draw something over his hair so you know where the lines are?  Well, yeah, you'd hate to have a sloppy line because that would look stupid.  Ha ha ha ha.  That is so fucking funny.  Oh, fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Snap a line on his head.  When you're right, you're right, though.  I'm an ass.  All right.  Start from the left ear.  And let's see how this works.  Just a little bit and then kind of stop. 
[02:36:30]  Bless Danny how it's feeling.  God, can you tell we all need a few days on?  How great would it be if it dug into his scalp and he just pulled a good quarter inch  of the scalp up?  Wow.  Oh, wow.  I've got to get over there.  It's like the opening sequence of Full Metal Jacket.  We got a mic?  Yeah.  How about a paper to throw that on?  We had papers.  He had papers, the papers.  Are there settings on there for depth?  Are you getting them right down the scalp?  Danny, turn your head this way a minute.  Oh, shit.  This is going to look really good. 
[02:37:00]  It's going to have to be a little wider.  The headphone won't fit.  Good.  Sam's doing a good job.  Of course he is.  Yeah.  Let me tell you about what I used to own my own bottle shop.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  You're off track a little.  I can fit into both worlds.  The ear is like right here.  All right.  He's kind of reaching the top.  Oh, my God.  Danny's head.  Danny's totally unconcerned. 
[02:37:30]  He's just sitting there.  We were trying to start that contest, the worst hairdo.  You haven't come in with yours yet, Jimmy.  I know.  I had to shave it for Letterman.  Excuse me.  Is it getting wider?  No, it's really good, dude.  Yeah.  It's really good.  I really love those headphones to just fit right in the pocket.  All right.  Oh, he's bending his ear down to get behind it a little bit.  Sam's doing a good job.  Really touching up like a pro.  I want him to look like a mangy dog. 
[02:38:00]  Never mind touching him up.  All right.  He's gone to the other side and drawn a line down his head with his finger.  And there we go.  Straight up.  And meet.  Did you meet the other?  Not yet.  Not yet?  Again, right back down by the ear.  He's coming up.  You can hear he's right on the scalp now.  All right. 
[02:38:30]  You on that?  I felt it meet.  Oh, you felt it meet?  Oh, cool.  Intercontinental hairline.  There we go.  Is it wide enough?  See?  What's with those loose hairs just kind of hanging out up there?  There should be a line going back this way as well, like a red cross.  Like an X in his head?  Yeah.  I mean, this way you can't wear a hat.  Yeah.  Right now you can wear a baseball cap and cover that up.  I don't like it.  That's what it'll do.  Dan's a sneak. 
[02:39:00]  Well, let's see what we got so far.  How's it looking, guys?  Well, hold on.  Hey.  He's widening it a little bit.  Are you widening it?  I'm giggling.  Sam is giggling.  Because Sam is the biggest fucking prick in this joint.  We came to this conclusion.  He looks like an innocent, kind of young, rosy-cheeked boy.  But word on the street, he is the fucking most vindictive prick in this place.  He'll play jokes on everybody, try to get people in fucking trouble. 
[02:39:30]  He looks like a young Prince Harry.  Oh, are you claiming victory?  That's done?  Let's see, Dan.  Let's see.  It doesn't look that bad.  Oh, my God.  It looks crazy.  Let me see the side.  Let me see the side.  Holy shit.  It looks like you've had brain surgery.  Ah, shit.  That is good.  How can we fix it up?  It looks really good.  It could be a little wider.  It could be.  And I think there should be one going over the top.  Yeah.  I think Jimmy might be right. 
[02:40:00]  Also, do you see how long the hair is where he's almost able to comb it over the gap?  Trim that down.  Not to the scalp, but just like freehand it a little to just get some of that longer hair  from folding over.  And make it even.  Because it kind of curls back.  See, look at you.  You're a pro.  Don't cut it unevenly because it'll just look really bad.  Yeah, that'll just look silly.  There he is.  He's trimming the hair that he could have used as a comb over for that landing strip on his 
[02:40:30]  head.  But only trim it on this side.  There's one side.  Yeah, of course.  One side of the front, then the other one through the back.  Yeah.  I feel bad.  He didn't fuck up this bad.  He certainly did.  He really didn't fuck up this bad.  This warns other people, though.  You're right.  They go, wow, if he didn't fuck up that bad and he got this, I better not fuck up at  all.  He's just with.  Getting a call on his razor.  Let me see.  All right. 
[02:41:00]  Turn.  Turn your head.  There we go.  Atta boy.  Oh, boy.  Is that awful?  Did he get the other side?  All right.  He's getting the other side.  Well, that is horrid.  Just tuning in.  Danny is getting a fine haircut.  It's just a swap.  Curtis BF Sam.  It is a fire break between his ears.  It goes from one ear over the top of his head down to the other ear as if headphones  were put on and you shaved under where the headphones would go. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  Sam doing a good freehand clip job.  It was good.  The curl over that Danny has going.  I got to take it quickly.  A little more up front.  Like, like, not up front front, but I see, I see, like, see that little cowlick that's  going back?  Right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get rid of that.  There we go.  Now you're talking.  Okay.  You almost, like, gave him a better hair.  It looks better just from the front than it did before. 
[02:42:00]  But from the side, oof.  That is a fucking disaster, man.  That is great.  I'm going to get some white LEDs and make landing lights.  A little runway head.  Yeah.  We should do an X.  Yeah.  You just got to come from the front all the way down the back.  Why not?  You want to do the front to the back?  Yeah.  A thinner line, though. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  It's in the front.  It looks normal.  Just a single, yeah.  Front to the back.  Yeah.  Just a single line.  Here it goes.  This one's really going to show.  Yeah.  Oh, and you missed.  You're way off to the right.  Holy shit.  That looks horrible.  That's fine.  But get that little piece in the front.  Yeah.  Like Danny DeVito.  Oh, there you go.  That a boy.  That's it.  There you go.  Perfect.  There you go. 
[02:43:00]  It's like a little crossroad.  Yeah, and the back.  If you're going to do it, you've got to get it from the front, too.  Oh, yeah.  That's good enough.  That way it'll shave with the grain or whatever they call it.  Yeah, just make sure that the line is not even crooked on the back.  Yeah, I've heard of that thought.  It starts out.  I wouldn't do any more on the front, Sam, only because this way it looks.  There's no way that can be a style.  That can't be a hairstyle.  Just you wait.  Just you wait.  And don't.  And Sam, Sam.  Now, don't start at the middle and end up way on the side of the back of his head. 
[02:43:30]  All right.  Whatever you do.  We just do one with the front, too.  Yeah.  While you were away.  Yeah.  What, are you going all the way back down?  Yeah, but not in a straight line.  All through my island head.  You're right, Ant.  He looks like he had brain surgery.  Doesn't it look like he had to have his brain, his scalp stapled together or something?  You can tell that we're heading toward a holiday.  That's good.  Goofing off. 
[02:44:00]  That looks good.  Wait, can I say it real quick before you finish it?  I just want to see how he looks from the back.  Yeah.  Spin the chair around.  Oh, my God.  I think that's good.  I say that needs no more work.  That's perfect.  Yeah, if you shave too much now, it'll look like you're meant to do it.  Yeah, that's good.  Instead of a horrible industrial accident.  There you go.  That is great.  What are you going to do now?  You've never shaved your head before, right? 
[02:44:30]  Oh, actually, I have.  You have?  It's been a very long time.  You know what?  Videotape him walking into the bathroom and looking in the mirror.  You've got to look at yourself.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, you've got to get a good look at yourself.  Good job, Sam.  Yeah, good job there, Sam.  No, no, no hat.  No hat.  Official barber.  Oh, just taking it.  Okay.  All right.  Just taking it.  Atta boy.  All right.  Oh, God.  Hats are not permitted, son.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  Oh, see, anyone could shave their head.  This is so much worse. 
[02:45:00]  Oh, you're a mangy mess.  Marge should be calling to help you, send money for you.  Jesus.  It's like a mangy dog.  Old cancer do.  It's just the perfect X in his head.  All right.  You want to take a quick break?  Yeah, I got to win.  All right.  We're going to play Racist Kramer over here.  Good.  Yeah, without the bleeps.  Stupid FM bleeps.  Yeah, go ahead.  Out of principle.  They're following him into the bathroom with the microphone.  Yeah, I'm going to have to get his reaction.  Something tells me, you know, knowing Danny. 
[02:45:30]  They don't care.  He doesn't care about anything.  No.  He doesn't do anything.  Eh, shave it.  Who cares?  Eyebrows.  Eyelashes.  Whatever.  Huh?  Yeah.  Doesn't matter.  Rip my tongue out.  Shove something on my ass.  Danny!  We're walking into the bathroom right now.  All right.  He's going to get a little look.  He's laughing.  Oh, that's just terrific.  That's just terrific.  Do you like it? 
[02:46:00]  Danny?  Yeah.  All right.  I can hear you guys now.  What do you think?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Yeah?  Is he filming it with Spruder's camera?  I know.  That fucking thing.  That's that awful fan in there.  Yeah.  That is fantastic.  All right, Danny.  I'm not going to get much else out of you there.  All right.  Enjoy your new do.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll continue in just a bit.  The current it boys of FM Talk are the New York-based duo of Opie and Anthony.  And the talk is racy and raw at times, pushing the limits as far as they can.

We're going to have a disgusting body fluid blowout.  Gay porn.  Hey, could you soap up your bad plate?  The sluttier, the better.  I would definitely be willing to have sex with you if we both already had AIDS.  It's certainly not your father's talk radio.

Whip them out Wednesday.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:47:30]  The big story of the day, of course, is Kramer at the Laugh Factory out there in L.A.  Everyone's talking about it today.  Everyone.  And we can finally play it uncensored over here on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:48:00]  People very sensitive about language.  Yeah, the first half of the show, they don't allow us to say the N-word, which is so ridiculous.  Yeah.  And in the context of a news story like this, it really puts a little more detail into the story.  It makes it a little more understandable than, you know, having to speak like you're in the third grade  using statements like the N-word was used.  Well, here it is.  Come on.  In case you missed it, here's Kramer on stage at the Laugh Factory in L.A. 
[02:48:30]  And he's just going off.  Here it is uncensored.  Shut up!  Fifty years ago, you had you all tied down with a f***ing fork on your ass!  You can talk, you can talk, you can talk your brain now, a f***er!  You're all ass out!  He's a nigger!  He's a nigger!  He's a nigger!  Oh, my God.  A nigger!  Look, he's a nigger!  Woo!  Woo! 
[02:49:00]  Woo!  All right.  You see?  It shocks you.  It shocks you.  You see what's buried beneath you all the stupid motherf***ers?  That was a law book.  What was it called for?  It's not called for you.  You're all my ass, you cheat motherf***er!  You guys have been talking and talking and talking!  So what?  The curses were bleeped out.  The beeping was not us.  On YouTube, it was like that.  So for whatever reason, they beeped on YouTube.  Oh, okay.  The curses were bleeped out.  All right. 
[02:49:30]  And then here's part two.  Wait a minute.  Where's he going?  He's a f***er.  He's a f***er.  He's a f***er.  He's a f***er.  He's a f***er.  He's a f***er.  He's a f***er.  I like you.  I like you.  You f***er guy.  I'm a fan.  Oh, you're threatening me?  We'll see what's up.  Oh, it's a big threat.  That's how you get back in the ass.  That was real popcorn.  Wait a minute.  He's not going here, dude.  It's not funny.  That's why you're reset.  Never had no show.  Never had no movie.  It's not built.  That's it.  Oh, I guess you got me there. 
[02:50:00]  You're absolutely right.  I'm just a wash up.  Got to stand on the stage.  Oh, fuck.  So we had it.  We had it.  We had it.  We had it.  We had it.  And it is.  Anybody such a figure?  That's what the f***er call for.  It ain't necessary.  Oh, no.  It ain't necessary.  Well, you interrupted me, pal.  That's what happens when you interrupt the white man.  He's going to chuck you out.  Call for it.  Copy.  Copy.  And there you have it. 
[02:50:30]  Wow.  And we have Jamie on the line.  He's the owner of the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles and the sister club here in New York.  Yes, Jamie.  What's up?  Hey, man.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  How you doing?  You're getting a lot of attention today, huh?  Oh, man.  That kind of attention I don't want to get, man.  No, huh?  I don't know what's happening with me.  I always get the wrong attention.  With Michael Jackson, I got the wrong attention.  There's no good deed going without punishment.  That's what's going on, man.  I'll let the guys go on the stage.  That's what I get. 
[02:51:00]  Wait.  What was the Michael Jackson attention again?  Oh, you remember that kid was from our comedy camp.  He was a kid from our comedy camp.  He came in, and he went with Michael, and he went to his house, and the kid was dying of  cancer, and we introduced him to Michael Jackson.  You were the one who introduced him to Michael Jackson?  Yeah.  God, you're a hell of a friend.  Please be nice.  Be nice to me.  Don't stop going.  No.  Please.  I don't know where you guys are going with that.  Now, were you at the club when this happened? 
[02:51:30]  Yes, I was.  So you were.  So you saw the whole thing.  I saw the whole thing, and I felt sick in my stomach.  I went outside.  Everybody started leaving, and I started giving them all money back, and I gave them money  for their drinks, everything.  I gave every single person their money because, you know, I mean, one thing, I have a policy  in here that anybody comes in here, we guarantee them laughter.  We are the only clubs we guarantee laughter.  If they don't laugh, we give them their money back.  And that night, I felt like, after 20 years being in, 28 years being in the business, that's 
[02:52:00]  the first night I ever refined everybody's money for the drinks.  Wow.  You know, not only would I not give my money back, I would have tipped like 25%.  That is entertainment, my friend.  Let me ask you a question, Jamie.  Oh, my God.  Don't.  Don't even go there.  Wait.  It's entertainment, though.  I'm not even kidding.  Jimmy brought it up today.  If you go to a comedy club, and you see someone like Kramer having a complete meltdown and  getting completely racist on that stage, you can't pay for entertainment like that.  One of the things people go to comedy for me, you know this. 
[02:52:30]  I mean, as a comic, I know it, too.  People like to see the unexpected.  They obviously didn't want to see that.  But when you see a really, one of the most famous characters in television history is Kramer,  and to see him having a complete emotional breakdown on stage, it might not be pleasant,  but, man, you won't forget that for the rest of your life.  Do you think people would have remembered the Hindenburg landing at Lakehurst without  incident?  Oh, God.  No one would have remembered.  Hey, let me ask you, Jamie.  What was going on?  Like, what were they actually yelling?  Because I heard those guys had been in the club the night before. 
[02:53:00]  What was happening with those guys?  What were they yelling at?  They would keep yelling, you're not funny, you're not funny, get off the stage, you're not  funny, get off the stage.  And all of a sudden, the guy had a, you know, he just, poor guy, you know, he was, I feel  bad for him because all of a sudden, I think he did, he's not that racist.  Maybe something happened, clicked in his mind because all of a sudden, what's happened  is the confidence, as a comedian, you know, the confidence is gone, and he just started  blushing back at them. 
[02:53:30]  Jamie, we're all racist, first of all.  As people.  As people, yeah.  But when he was on that stage, was he doing any racial humor?  No.  None.  He was just doing his act.  He didn't use the N-word, none of that crap.  And then when these guys, none of that.  These guys obviously got under his skin in such a way, he just went for the jugular and  went for the atom bomb.  Yes.  And by the way, Paul Mooney, just walking in here, if you guys want to talk to him,  then I'll get back to it, and I'll have Paul Rodriguez in here.  Then after that, I'll get back to you guys. 
[02:54:00]  I would love to hear from Mooney, because I would like to hear his angle.  Was he there or no?  Yeah, Paul Mooney, he wasn't in here, but he saw the tape.  He's talking to CNN and everybody about, because Paul Mooney, don't forget, Paul Mooney  and Richard Pryor, they were the first people to open my club in here 28 years ago, and  Richard Pryor and Paul Mooney, they were the first people.  They went on the stage.  They used the N-word, and the reason they used the N-word, they were telling me because  of the, take the power away from that N-word, and that was the billion way they did  that, but, you know, Michael did it because of hate-wise, but Paul and Richard, they did 
[02:54:30]  it because of other reasons.  Jamie, let me ask you a question, though.  Yes.  Was it hate, or is it, and I've been heckled, we've all been heckled, all comedians, is it  hate, or is it just when somebody hits you on a certain level, like the worst thing you  can say to a comic is you're not funny?  I mean, that really hits you at your core.  Isn't it human nature sometimes?  I'm not saying what he said was right, but you want to hit them back as hard as they just  hit you, and with a black guy, it's a racial thing.  If it was a woman, he probably would have called her a cunt. 
[02:55:00]  If it was a fat guy, he would have just, whatever, if it was somebody in a wheelchair,  he would have called him a cripple.  He went for the most hurtful thing he could hit with because he had just gotten hit with  something that, as a comedian, let's be honest, that really is emasculating.  You're absolutely right, we've all seen that, I've seen everything from Sam Kenison on the  stage to, you know, to, I mean, they used to, a lot of Robin Williams, all of those guys,  they used to come in a club, they used to watch Paul Mooney performing and, you know,  taking all of that stuff from, you know, I mean, it was amazing. 
[02:55:30]  Anyway, why don't I put Paul in because then I get Paul Rodriguez, then I'll get back to  you guys, talk again more, whatever you guys want to do.  I love both of you guys, I think you're the funniest people on airs, man.  I want to get you in a club in New York City, come to Laugh Factory in New York City performing  there, guys.  We can make a deal, this is what I suggest.  You get Michael Richards for a month at the Laugh Factory in New York.  You want to see crowds there, Jamie.  We'll plug them.  I'm going to do it.  If you said, I'm going to get a crowd, I'm going to bring him up there. 
[02:56:00]  You've got to understand promotion, my friend.  Has he been banned from the club?  He's been banned from the club.  I'm the first person, and this is the first time in my life I've banned somebody from the  club.  Wow.  Are you going to lift that ban, do you think?  If he make it good with everybody, if he's African American and everybody, he make it good  with them, and then at that point, you know, we can't serve it.  Oh, just lift the ban.  He was just being a silly goose up there.  He didn't mean it.  He didn't mean it.  Silly goose.  I know.  Just being a...  If you guys said he didn't mean it, I believe you guys. 
[02:56:30]  Because you're both coming.  You know what's going on.  You know what's coming next.  Rehab.  Yep.  That's right.  That's right.  Rehab.  And talking about rehab, here is Mr. Paul Mooney.  All right.  Yeah.  Hey, Paul.  Paul, how are you doing, man?  What's up?  How funny was that the other night?  Opie Anthony, Jimmy Norton, of course.  What's your take on it?  I mean, obviously...  He had a nervous breakdown.  Yeah.  You know, he had a complete nervous breakdown.  The take on it, if you know comedy at all.  See, he hung those guns up.  That's why Jesse James got shot in the back. 
[02:57:00]  He hasn't been on that front line.  He's had it easy.  He's been on that TV.  He's gotten all that love.  And he came back to do that stand-up.  And you can't walk away.  You get out of step.  Right.  It's like being a soldier.  And when he got heckled, he didn't know how to handle it.  And he flipped.  Because I'd heard about it.  I got phone calls about it.  I mean, you know, I say a lot of things.  I mean, I don't care what anybody says.  I'm not usually offended.  But I was offended by the anger, by the truth that just poured out of him.  Because he said on the stage, now you know how I feel.  You know, and I kind of felt like, I thought maybe the South had won. 
[02:57:30]  The way he was screaming and raving about it.  And saying, saying, nigga, and fork in your ass.  And hell upside down and all that other crap that he said.  And it was just, it just oozed out.  So what bugged you wasn't the fact that he said it.  It was the fact that it was almost like something blew his real feelings out.  That it was a breakdown.  It was a nervous breakdown.  Him, O.J., and Mel Gibson should do a movie together.  Three crazy men, and thank God there's no baby.  Brand new record at the box office, that would make. 
[02:58:00]  I'm just saying, it was freaky and it was weird.  And it was actually personal.  He had personal problems because that he was saying and that anger.  And he just got out.  It's like that liquor and that emotion.  And race is a very important thing.  I mean, I've been doing this for a long time.  I've been telling everybody.  But they all look at me like I have three heads.  Race is a very, very important thing in America.  And it only could happen in California.  Well, were you surprised that people walked out?  I mean, like, look, as comics, when something weird is happening in the room, I mean, why 
[02:58:30]  did people walk out?  Obviously, was it their moral objection?  Or were they afraid the guy was going to come back in with a pistol?  No, I think they walked out because they got afraid of what was going on, that somebody  would get hurt.  Listen, my friend that's dead, Eric Douglas, he said one Monday night at the comedy store,  he said, I hate nigger night.  And a black man got up and knocked him in the head with a chair.  Wow.  Yeah.  But wasn't it billed that way at the club?  What?  He said, what did they call that at the club?  Why would he say that?  No, it wasn't billed. 
[02:59:00]  He's kidding.  No, no, that was black.  And who hit Eric Douglas in the head?  Was it Kirk or Michael?  I mean, I kind of knew Eric.  He tried to take me to a club one night and party.  He sued the comedy store.  I don't know if you remember that.  No, I actually never even heard about that.  Yeah, he got hit.  No, no, he got hit in the head with a chair.  And he sued for lack of security?  Let me tell you something.  It's very dangerous.  You're in shark-infested waters if you start playing around with that word  and you don't have any experience with the word  or you haven't been around with the word.  It gets to be real weird. 
[02:59:30]  You know, the youth react to it differently.  I mean, I have youth in my house, and they want to kill him.  I mean, you know, for my generation, I mean, we're always marching  and we want to sit down and discuss it.  If you can't ride on the bus, and we'll all talk about it.  But the youth, they want to turn the bus over and burn it.  Nobody will ride.  Well, what is your – now, look, you do a lot of racial stuff.  I've seen you enough times.  No, no, I've been – no, no, not do a lot of it.  I mean, the person that started with the N-word was Dick Gregory,  and then Richard took the ball because I've ridden for Richard for 30 years. 
[03:00:00]  Well, I don't even mean the N-word.  I'm saying just racial issues in general.  Yeah, racial period, right.  So what is the worst reaction you've gotten by doing that stuff?  Because I know a lot of white people don't like what you say on stage.  What's the worst reaction you've gotten?  A lot of black people don't like it.  Okay, what's the worst reaction?  You know, everybody thinks race is color.  It's race is mentality.  It's not color.  It's mentality.  You could be as black as Wesley Snipes and not like black people.  Well, have you had bad reactions from audiences?  Mentally, huh?  Bad reactions?  Have you had any kind of –  I've had black and white people get crazy over race. 
[03:00:30]  Race is a very emotional and important thing.  I can get out of an audience in 15 minutes more than their psychiatrist can get out of them in 15 months.  You ever surprised by the way they react?  No, not surprised by it.  Not in California, no.  Not in California.  You know, you have to remember.  This is where you have your police stuff.  It only happens here.  Manson, it only happens here.  Do you think –  California has burnt three times racially.  Do you think in the right context, 
[03:01:00]  a white comic can go up  and use the word  and not have a problem?  No.  Why?  It's just because it's very dangerous.  Because they have no experience with the word.  And because white people created the word.  You can't –  you can't –  listen, you can't create something  that you've used against a group of people.  A group of people that you –  black people are actually a conquered race.  When you take a person's religion  and their name from them,  you do them.  I mean, I have a European name. 
[03:01:30]  You know, I don't have an African name.  White people who were born in Africa  say they're Africano.  They don't have African names, do they?  I don't think so.  No, they keep their names.  They're not conquered.  So it's just dangerous.  It's just very dangerous.  So you see a white guy in no context at all,  no matter how funny the bit is,  should ever use the word on stage?  I can't say ever,  because it's been done in movies  and it's been done on the stage 
[03:02:00]  in a theatrical thing.  It's okay.  You know?  Yeah.  But I mean, on a one-on-one,  that stand-up is personal.  And unless you've got some kind of connection  that's real heavy,  it's just –  it's very dangerous.  But I've seen black comics  on load  on stereotyping white people  and goofing  and sometimes getting pretty nasty about it.  Yeah, but it's – 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, but it's not –  That's okay.  No, it's not okay.  It's because white people haven't been lynched  because they're white.  You understand?  Well, I understand.  Yeah, so how much time has to go by,  do you think?  What?  Before it's acceptable  for us to –  For everybody to get up and say what they want.  And say what they want.  Right.  Complete freedom of speech  in a comedy club.  Well, you're going to have to get rid of Bush  for starters.  Well, I think you got that.  I think that's in the bag. 
[03:03:00]  That's just a better time.  No, but we haven't gotten over Reaganomics yet.  So, you know, once you do some stuff –  It's still trickling down.  Yeah, but we haven't gotten over Reaganomics yet.  So Bush got two more years.  So we just have to wait around and see.  So you're saying that race is more –  black people have a different kind of –  a different freedom with race on stage  because it's more of a reactive thing  than with white people who have been –  Well, also, the youth.  The youth run around calling themselves niggas.  Let's face it.  My nigger, your nigger.  The youth has a different –  Listen, the youth in my house  have a different reaction to this than I do. 
[03:03:30]  You know, I told you that.  I mean, that Kramer stuff,  they want to kill him.  Yeah, is that right?  Oh, no, the youth?  Oh, no, they don't have any patience.  No, they want his ass beat or him hurt.  Oh, yeah.  So what I'm getting from talking to you, though,  is that there is a First Amendment double standard  as far as race goes  as to what is acceptable for people to say on a stage.  But the Constitution and the Amendment,  they weren't written for black people. 
[03:04:00]  We were animals, remember?  You're forgetting.  There's a lot of were here.  Yeah, but it's not –  No, but I'm just saying it wasn't –  Listen, don't be offended  because you've got white skin.  Don't get uptight.  It's the reality of it.  You're putting words in my mouth.  We can't get angry about it.  I'm not putting words in your mouth.  You're putting words in my mouth.  I really have no sense –  Believe me, I have no sense of guilt whatsoever, my friend.  Paul, you don't understand.  This is the most guiltless white guy ever.  I have no sense of guilt.  Paul, that act's not going to work with us. 
[03:04:30]  We don't have that white guilt that you like to work off.  I'm not working with you.  Listen to me.  Listen to me.  I'll listen.  I've been black longer than you've been white, okay?  What?  I'll listen.  I've been black longer than you've been white.  I'm older than you.  Not by much.  These two are fucking believing.  They look a lot younger in their press photos.  But it doesn't matter.  I'm just telling you the facts of white.  So what does that mean?  I thank God we're in America.  We can argue and be like this.  There's no problem.  Yeah, but I'm saying what does that mean?  There's a double standard on the First Amendment  as far as blacks and whites go 
[03:05:00]  and the use of that word.  There is a double standard.  The use of what word?  Nigger.  They're saying it on stage in certain times.  Where did nigger come from?  Since you're an expert on it,  where did it come from?  I would believe probably a country's name in Africa  where they brought slaves over from.  Who do you think the first person was called, nigger?  I would say a slave.  Yeah, who wouldn't work.  Who was defiant to the master. 
[03:05:30]  Probably by a black slave owner.  Huh?  By a black slave owner.  That's another myth.  See?  A black slave owner.  You're trying to connect it up to say,  well, you did it first.  Slavery was different in Africa  before the white man came.  We're not interested in what we did in Africa  before the white man came.  Well, we're kind of...  I'm only interested in what happened in the Western world.  We're kind of not interested in what happened  300 years ago.  Yeah, before slavery was abolished.  Once it was abolished,  yeah, there was still a lot of racism and hatred, 
[03:06:00]  but do you...  Some people don't see any improvement  over the times when lynchings were acceptable to now.  Do you know you have black blood in your veins?  Of course.  I'm Sicilian.  Because of slavery?  No, I don't care what you are.  You do know that because of slavery.  And I have white blood because of slavery.  And that's why the two...  We are arguing right now.  Nobody hates like family.  My brother.  Well, I know it.  That's why.  If I was your friend...  Listen, you'll be on your deathbed,  your brother, your sister.  You'll die saying, 
[03:06:30]  that bitch or that motherfucker.  But your friend...  Oh, forgive him.  Have him come.  It's the way it is.  And that white man is the responsible  because he carries the seat.  He carries the name.  He screwed all the black women.  Don't get me into this.  You'll get me crazy.  Why?  Get crazy.  Who gives a shit?  Get crazy, man.  I was very nice talking to you,  and I'll see you on the next ride, okay?  All right, Paul.  Take it easy, man.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Here, here.  No, it's a fine discussion.  I would have liked to have spoken with Paul 
[03:07:00]  for a lot longer.  We don't mind talking as angry as much.  I'll get him by now on the line.  It's absolutely fine.  I got no problem talking to Paul.  Let's get Paul Rodriguez on it.  Here it is, Paul Rodriguez.  Well, this is a great entrance.  Hi, Paul.  How are you doing, man?  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's Jim Norton.  You were actually at the club when it happened.  I was.  Like, when did you realize,  all right, well, this is getting fucking awful fast?  Well, with Michael,  you want to give him a lot of lead weight.  I still kept thinking he's making a point. 
[03:07:30]  He's going somewhere with this, you know?  Now, see, he's not a road memorization guy.  This guy does a lot of all ad-lib.  You know, from night to night,  he doesn't say the same thing like other comics  that have a set routine, you know,  how far along they're in their act by the jokes, you know?  This guy's brilliant in a lot of ways.  I'm sorry that this happened to him.  And I hope that the African-American community  finds it in their heart after whatever hoops  that he has to jump to bring him back. 
[03:08:00]  I'm not ready to dismiss him  and never have Kramer, never have Michael back.  I mean, I've known him for many, many years  as much as you can know.  I'm an extremely introverted person.  But he's a great talent, man.  He didn't get there just by just not being funny.  Paul, don't you think this is getting ridiculous?  It's like, look, look, I mean, I'm a comic, I'm a white comic.  And I know that a lot of times what we say is real on stage  and a lot of times it's just in a moment of anger.  And look, his apology was awful  because he's obviously a shy, you know, 
[03:08:30]  fucking obviously one of those looms.  Yeah, he's an introvert.  He's as sincere as he could be at the moment.  I thought it was sincere.  But I agree.  But forgiveness from the African-American,  it's like, look, he said he was sorry.  His behavior wasn't bad.  He just said some stupid shit.  Shouldn't the African-American community  just get a hold of itself and move on?  I don't think most black people are that incensed.  I think it's a few people that like to grab something  and run with it.  Because it's like most people are like,  who gives a shit?  He's Kramer.  So what?  He's not a politician.  I like to believe that, too.  Unfortunately, the calls and the threats  and the existing has... 
[03:09:00]  Look, you know it's sad  when this story replaces a legit murderer, you know?  When it's replacing the Katie Cruz Holmes wedding.  My God.  Nobody's talking about Britney.  No, this has captured the imagination  of everybody and everything.  Because I think deep down,  where we all live, all of us,  me, all of us,  we have a certain...  There's something innate about racial jokes.  It makes our lousy life seem better.  Somehow it's survivable to know that, 
[03:09:30]  you know, I'm so-and-so,  but I'm not so-and-so.  You know, there's always that sort of thing.  It's nature.  Look, I think he deserves a second chance,  especially in the spirit of Christmas  coming at the holidays.  You know, I'm not defending him in the least.  I witnessed it.  I've never seen that before.  It was horrible and all said and done.  But he himself must be in a horrible,  horrible place right now.  I'd be afraid for him hurting himself, man. 
[03:10:00]  He, you know, this is just a down payment  on what cell phones and the video cell phone  is going to...  There's a lot of people  going to be caught with their pants down.  You mark my words.  When is the last...  This is the thing that bugs me.  Because I think, yeah,  you've got to apologize sometimes  when you say something stupid  or you've got to be like, hey...  But, I mean, it's like,  how much Mia Culpa  is he going to have to do?  It's like, you know,  black people never gave a shit about him.  Are they going to care about him now?  It's like, so what?  He said something stupid.  He did say he was sorry,  as awkward as it was.  All right, well,  in all reality, though, fellas,  it's just been two days. 
[03:10:30]  Come on.  Now, even I'm not ready  to cut him that kind of slack.  But I am...  I'm not ready to dismiss him forever.  I'm not ready to...  You know, there will come a time  where cooler heads will prevail  and realize that, look,  you know what?  Have you seen what the...  I've seen African-American comics.  And may I say this  at the risk of getting more hate mail.  Look, you cannot have hit  after hit after hit rap albums  making all this money  where they use the N-word 
[03:11:00]  as an adjective, you know?  Right, right.  End this and end that.  And look, if it's so offensive,  it's a start there for a change.  You know, you've got these  white kids in the suburb  trying to be all the coolness,  all the hip things,  all the trends that started  in the ghetto.  African-Americans have  a tremendous influence on that.  Okay, well,  if you continue to hoe  and to pimp  and to bitch  and to, you know,  where all kinds of romanticism  is gone,  nothing but AKA fire  and all that,  it has a devastating effect  on the African-American community. 
[03:11:30]  Well, you know,  maybe this crazy man,  this lunatic,  whatever he was that night,  maybe he listened to  too many ludicrous albums.  Paul, aren't you,  like, as a comedian,  I mean, look,  there's a difference  between what he did,  which was, you know,  look, it was obviously  real anger that came out.  Don't you get sick and tired,  Paul, don't you get sick  and tired, though,  of having to say  African-American  and the N-word  like we're children.  Doesn't it seem  like it's just condescending  and childlike? 
[03:12:00]  It's like black people  can handle  being called black people.  I just,  I did that last night  on one of these networks,  I forgot,  and used it,  and my email is clogged.  You used what?  I used the word.  In what context?  He was talking about,  he said,  I said,  I said, you know,  I said,  I feel stupid  using the N-word.  You know,  we all know  what we're talking about.  Nigga, there,  I said it.  What, the world didn't end?  You know,  I don't know,  but, you know,  again, 
[03:12:30]  is it the inflection?  Do we have to go  to take ebonics?  If we say nigger,  that's horrible,  but if we say nigga,  is it happy?  Is it party time?  Look,  either write down  some pamphlets,  some rules,  or we all could all  abide by it,  or just realize  that people are human.  We have off days,  you know?  I mean,  he had a horrible  Magna Carta off day,  but I want to believe  still that there is  a Santa Claus. 
[03:13:00]  I want to believe  that this dude  will do us  a lot more good  in the long run.  You know,  he himself,  one of the things  I found the most  offensive was,  I'm rich.  How crass is that?  Did he say that?  You're rich.  Yeah, he said,  I'm rich.  You're going to have your wrist.  I said,  well, you know what,  Magna,  if you are rich,  which you are,  how about buying  every turkey there is  and taking it  to South Central  or wherever?  How about somebody  addressing the piece  of shit heckler  who wasn't thrown  out of the club?  Why didn't they dump  the guy who kept yelling,  you're not funny,  get off the stage?  Before the tirade started. 
[03:13:30]  That didn't come  off the top.  That came after,  you know,  sometimes it's funny,  sometimes it's not.  That came after  10,  10,  15 minutes of,  he was just not  hitting his mark,  man.  It was just not funny.  And I'm telling you here,  you know,  the biggest crime is  if you're not being funny,  get off,  go,  goodbye,  it's over,  chalk it up.  Yeah,  he got under his skin  though,  man,  he couldn't take it.  The guy,  as a comedian,  man,  when someone says 
[03:14:00]  you're not funny,  get off the stage,  I mean,  that really is  the worst thing  you can say to us.  So he was hitting back  as hard as he could.  Yeah,  well,  you try,  you know,  and then,  you know,  you go to your,  you hop on your Porsche  and then you go  to your big house.  Yeah,  right.  At that point,  the man had a period.  He had a man,  he had a man period.  You know?  Yeah,  yeah.  He had,  dude,  it could happen,  it could happen again.  Hopefully not to him,  but which one of us 
[03:14:30]  who calls ourselves a comic  is immune from dying?  I don't care who you are,  I saw Briar die.  You know?  So it could happen.  If it could happen to him,  it could happen to anybody.  And just put yourself  in his place.  I'm not in a position  to forgive and forget  because,  although he did make  a couple of cracks  of Latinos,  I'm not the defender  of the faith.  What I'm saying here is  that the only crime  that I saw was  that he was not funny  that night.  Now,  for that,  I'm not ready to throw  the baby with the bathwater. 
[03:15:00]  But entertaining as hell,  huh, Paul?  Hey,  we're talking about him.  Look,  no,  but I mean,  you're sitting there,  you got to admit,  you realize,  wow,  I'm seeing something  here tonight.  I was saying that.  It was entertaining  in the same way  that the Hindenburg,  it was entertaining  in the same way  that you saw a car wreck.  You know,  it was uncomfortable,  man.  How do people walk out?  Like,  look,  people come to see  the shows,  you want to laugh,  but I mean,  you want some kind  of a live,  but God almighty,  the guy from Seinfeld  is shouting nigger  and breaking down.  How does any audience  member walk out on that?  It was over and over. 
[03:15:30]  You just saw it.  Yeah.  That girl,  you just saw  a little teeny bit.  She got the camera.  She got the phone out.  No videotaping is allowed,  but that might as well  be thrown away.  She got that videotape.  There's others.  There's others  that I'm aware of already  that capture some  of the beginning  and some of the stuff.  But here,  to say the truth is  the black guy  up there,  that whole crowd,  those guys,  they were innocent  as far as I'm concerned  because,  and I'm not defending 
[03:16:00]  either way,  they were innocent  because they didn't  set out,  they're fans,  they didn't set out  heckling you ain't funny.  They gave the man  10 minutes.  Look,  you don't get a laugh  in 10 minutes.  Maybe you're not funny  that day.  Yeah,  but all right,  I understand that.  And they weren't going,  but they weren't going  with anything racial at all?  No,  no,  no.  The racial thing  was started,  but you know,  man,  I'd love to be able  to have a tape to go  to defend,  you know,  when it's all said and done,  we're like the cops,  you know,  we stand up for each other.  We want to.  But you can't defend this. 
[03:16:30]  He's the one that started,  I figured that,  do this brilliant,  and he is,  man,  he's had moments  of unbelievable lucidity  from,  I mean,  I go back to the Fridays  that show on ABC  years ago,  cutting edge,  you know?  I mean,  he had brilliant moments  where he begins  to talk like dogs  of different ethnic groups.  He does funny,  funny stuff,  you know?  But this particular moment,  he was trying out something.  You know,  I don't care how famous you are,  you get,  for that kind of fame, 
[03:17:00]  you get maybe a minute,  maybe a minute,  they'll cut you slack a minute.  After that,  we're all equal.  I don't care who you are.  Gotta leave,  yeah.  You're not getting laughs.  You're eating it,  and when you're eating it,  and let's face it,  it's like gambling.  Every time you go out there,  you don't know where to,  you know,  sometimes you're rolling sevens,  sometimes they're rolling you.  How much time  are you supposed to do?  Well,  with a star of that magnitude,  we pretty much leave it up to them,  but they usually don't abuse it,  you know?  They don't do,  you know,  the Chappelle will come in, 
[03:17:30]  but they do their 20,  they pretty much stay on time,  you know?  Well,  let me ask you,  as a comic,  being banned from the club  seemed like a weird,  especially since it was only a language.  I'm sure comedians,  Jamie said he didn't have  banned a comedian,  but I'm sure there's been  physical confrontations in there  where guys weren't even banned.  This was awful,  but it was only verbal.  I mean,  do you think banning the guy  from the club is right?  Or is it temporary?  It's the only bullet  we have to fire.  It's the only bullet  we have to fire.  We can't send him  cookies and milk.  Well,  the funny thing is 
[03:18:00]  you don't have to ban the guy.  Yeah.  You know what balls  it would take  for him to go back  on that stage?  He banned himself.  Hey,  how are you doing?  What do you think  of his apology?  I think he meant  the apology,  but it was just awful.  He did mean it.  You got to know him.  You got to know him  to know the dude  is extremely introvert.  I mean,  I don't think  in the 20-something years  that I don't think  we've said 10 words  in a row.  The guy offstage,  he's a totally different dude.  On stage,  he's this brass,  this crazy maniac. 
[03:18:30]  You don't know  what he's going to do.  You know,  that's the appealing  thing about it.  Offstage is,  hey, what's happening,  Michael?  How you doing, man?  I saw you on the deal.  Yeah, all right.  Hey, Paul.  Hey, how you doing?  That's it.  No more than a whisper.  I bet that's as loud  as I've ever seen him.  I know that's as loud  as I've ever seen him.  How many guys were there  at the table  that were heckling him?  Do you remember?  It was probably a party of,  there was only one guy  really that responded,  stood up and addressed  by the African-Americans.  But I remember,  I went over there  to see if there was a problem.  They were enjoying,  you know,  saying,  oh, no, no, 
[03:19:00]  I don't know what he's doing,  but remember that episode?  It was just so funny.  See, while they were talking,  Michael down there  on the floor,  he probably not hearing that.  Sometimes you hear  what you want to hear,  you know?  I'd probably,  probably a table of six.  Yeah.  Hey, Paul,  did you have to go on stage  after that?  There was nobody to go to.  Everyone filed out.  I became management,  you know,  I became management.  And then started  giving the money back.  I mean,  it got to the point  where,  you know,  there was another side of there.  There was a couple of dudes  that,  you know, 
[03:19:30]  were ready to put their hoods on  and going,  yeah,  now that's what we call comedy,  you know?  So it was,  you know.  But dude,  only in L.A.  with the whole club file out.  Like,  you know,  I was in the comedy cellar one night  and Robin Williams went on  and I guess  there was a race.  Actually,  one of the guys in the audience  called a comedian named Godfrey  and was arguing  with one of the guys  in the audience  and the guy called him a nigger.  And Godfrey is a pretty ballsy guy.  Godfrey Cambridge?  Yes.  No,  Godfrey,  Godfrey,  Dan Chima,  the comedian,  black comedian.  Yeah,  yeah.  And Godfrey addressed it  so the guy walked out 
[03:20:00]  and as the guy walked out  there was two,  like,  they were like,  they looked like Samoans  who were fans of Godfrey.  They are the two largest humans  I've ever seen in person.  One guy had to duck  to get out the comedy cellar door.  They went up the stairs  and a fight ensued  while I was on stage.  And I mean,  you could hear  giant tables being thrown.  Not one person  walked out of the club.  The whole club sat there  and looked up at the ceiling  and I tried to emcee the fight  and everybody stayed.  Not only in L.A.  would they all file out wounded.  Dude,  I remember when 
[03:20:30]  Johnny Witherspoon  got into a fight  with Eddie Murphy  right in front of me  and Paul Mooney  as a matter of fact.  I remember a lot of fights  but those are innocuous.  Things are going to happen,  you know.  You have a couple of drinks,  you look at somebody,  sometimes you just want to fight.  You didn't get into a couple of fights  here and there.  You know,  in my younger day  I threw some scat  but to tell you the truth,  this was more,  this is a fight,  a bloody nose,  tomorrow you wake up  and it's all right.  What was the problem you had?  I remember I read something  about you years ago  where you mentioned  the death squads or something  and you had a real problem  with someone in the audience. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It was during the conflict  in El Salvador.  I was working this dive bar  in East Los Angeles  and let's face it,  when I started,  I was the aboriginal.  I was the Latino community.  I was the only comic.  And when we started,  I did a joke in Spanish  about how ironic  that a country named  after our Savior Jesus,  you know,  if you're of the religion,  should be the bloodiest country.  So in Spanish,  it rhymes  El Cristo Sangriento,  the bloody Jesus,  you know.  And this guy 
[03:21:30]  from El Salvador  took exception to that  and in hindsight,  you know,  I respect him,  he was fighting for his guy.  It's just that  I got the better of him  because I had  a microphone stand.  What did he do?  that, you know,  I put it to use.  And the funny thing about it  is that he falls on the floor  and I go on like,  nothing happened  and the audience is dying.  They found that hilarious  and I was scared to death.  So you hit with the mic stand  after he came after you  and then just kept doing the set?  I saw him from the corner  looking at him,  I pick up the mic stand,  I pat him, 
[03:22:00]  he falls,  and thank God he wasn't legal  because he just sued me.  I didn't have nothing.  Well, thanks a lot, man,  for coming on.  Fellas,  love your show, man.  Keep it up and down.  This should be  wrecked with him, man.  He should make his amends  and I don't want him  banned forever,  you know?  I mean,  What do you think?  Rehab for Michael?  Well,  whatever he has to do,  he has to work out.  Well,  rehab seems to be  the thing in Hollywood.  You're going to rehab  and then you come out  and it's like,  okay,  he did something.  I'm all better.  Maybe there's a chair 
[03:22:30]  over there  with Mel and Thalians.  I don't know,  you know,  but whatever it is,  I hope that humor  will prevail at the end.  All right, man,  thanks a lot.  And thank Mooney  and Jamie for it.  Wait, let's get Jamie back on.  Okay.  Yeah.  We'll wrap up with Jamie.  Thanks, Paul.  If I can find him,  right,  I will.  Oh, yeah,  he's a busy man today.  Yeah, man.  He's roaming around.  Yeah.  What's going on there?  I would give him  the big plug.  Sure, sure.  Listen.  He just ran to another interview. 
[03:23:00]  He just ran to another interview.  He just ran to another interview.  Not the entire interview  is even worse.  But I think we're all entitled.  Not entitled,  but we're all going to have  a bad day.  Is it possible 
[03:23:30]  for him to have a period?  He had it.  You know,  he had the worst day  you could imagine.  But then again,  put yourself in his place.  Dude,  that's Carl's Mencia.  I swear to God.  I don't think that's Paul.  He's an apology.  He's here with him to say.  That's got to be Paul.  Yeah.  Yes, I did.  Jesus.  I wish  that the African-Americans  would have known him.  Paul Mooney gets me.  Oh,  could I just argue with him  all fucking day long?  Yeah,  but I'll tell you why I like him. 
[03:24:00]  He didn't fucking mince words.  He said what he had to say  without being politically correct.  That I like about him.  That's the worst part.  He will,  there's so much revisionist history  going on,  but he'll say it  as an educated guy  and,  no,  here's how it is.  And he'll be like,  no,  that's not how it is.  Do you think he is?  But I mean,  you can be honest with Mooney  and you know he's going to be  honest back to you  and you're never going to agree.  Well,  I just don't cry with him twice.  You're never going to agree with him.  Honest as far as  what he thinks honesty is.  Yeah,  of course.  I mean,  just without calling  his idea of it.  I mean, 
[03:24:30]  the whole thing with,  that Obi brought up  with black slavery,  you know,  there's a whole nation,  a country over there  that was just  cutting through  their own people  and enslaving them.  And then when Whitey came over,  you know,  they were helped out  by black tribesmen  to enslave black people.  For some reason,  Paul said,  no,  that never happened.  Oh,  okay.  All right,  Paul.  It was the next logical stage,  man.  Yeah.  They were enslaving  their own people.  And what's the time limit?  I asked him,  you know,  what's the time limit? 
[03:25:00]  Obviously,  you know,  a couple hundred years  isn't the time limit  for the time  that slavery ended.  Maybe 70 years  for when,  you know,  blacks really started  getting rights in this country  but didn't really have them.  Is that the time limit?  When we stopped  sicking dogs  and fire hoses,  is that the limit?  When is going to be the time  when anyone  could get on a stage  and speak like anyone else  in context of comedy?  Because Paul,  believe me,  I asked him,  he wasn't even for, 
[03:25:30]  you know,  white people  getting up there  and using  the N-word  under any circumstance  in comedy.  Well,  Carlin used it  in a great bit he did  about the power of words.  It was a sincere bit.  It wasn't,  you know,  Carlin says whatever he wants.  Yeah.  And he was talking about  it's not the word nigger,  it's the racist asshole  in the corner  that's using it.  And he went through  this whole long thing  about,  he goes,  Eddie Murphy  and Richard Pryor  used that word  and they're not racists.  They're niggers.  It was really a funny bit  and I'm not doing it justice  but I mean, 
[03:26:00]  Carlin made a great point  with the word.  Let's listen to not do Carlin.  Let's see what's going on  at the Laugh Factory in L.A.  Hey,  and no,  no one will say when.  I am forgetting you fellas  I'm going to go look for them.  See,  all right.  Wait a minute.  Is Carl's been seeing  at the club too?  No,  no.  Carl's is counting  his money someplace.  Did you jump into  another interview?  Huh?  You jumped into another interview.  Did you just jump on?  No,  that was me.  That was using my own voice.  Now,  yeah, 
[03:26:30]  it's a,  there's so many stations  out here  you would think  that Britney Spears  is fucking  somebody on the roof.  There,  give us some comedy,  Paul.  Let's go.  It's too serious  around here today.  It's bleak.  It's bleak,  you know,  there should be  some ray of hope  but I mean,  it's gotten to the point  where we've gotten  arson threats,  death threats.  Wow.  They've taken this too far.  Fortunately,  here we're in the capital 
[03:27:00]  of Gang City.  Something had happened  but you know what?  I ain't going down like that.  I'm packing.  Hey,  what are you going to be in New York?  You got any New York stuff coming?  I got to finish a picture  and then,  yeah,  I was in New York.  I did a,  I did comics.  I did comics a while back.  Terrific,  terrific club there.  That is nice.  That's a new place.  That's a new place.  Cool.  Yeah,  yeah,  it was a terrific night there.  I want to go back to New York  but you know,  right now,  I got to keep up  with the Lopez's  so I'm working on a TV series here. 
[03:27:30]  All right,  we'll see you when you come to New York.  All right,  fellas.  Tell Jamie thanks,  okay?  Will do,  will do,  man.  Nice talking to y'all.  Take care.  Right on.  Paul Rodriguez,  everyone.  And yes,  Laugh Factory,  we got one right here  in New York City.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Times Square.  I did a cringe humor show  there once.  It was,  it's the old show world  on 42nd.  It's really fucking weird  to walk up,  do you know how many,  you know how weird it is  to perform someplace  you've scrapped a hundred loads?  But it's a cool club,  man.  I mean,  it's right on 42nd,  8th.  It's got like a really weird vibe to it 
[03:28:00]  because of the history of it  but you are in upstairs  in show world  and they haven't changed it that much.  Like,  it's a nice club  but they left some of the original  like mirrors and shit.  It's like the vibe there  is kind of crazy.  Well,  you have been there a few times  if you recognize the mirrors  and wall decor.  Dude,  I recognize the floor tiles.  I'm like,  look at this.  That's my gum.  I dropped my gum.  I contact there.  I put it up.  You recognize old loads  on the floor.  Gum.  Gum with a C.  That's one of mine.  One over here.  Oh,  geez,  that's mine too.  Oh,  boy.  All right,  we got to get out of here  because we're going to replay  the Starker Patty facial. 
[03:28:30]  Anybody want a baby cat?  No,  thank you.  No.  All right.  We got to get off the air  really fast so they can time this out.  Okay,  Danny fucked up yesterday  and everyone was looking forward  to the replay of Starker Patty  getting that facial.
