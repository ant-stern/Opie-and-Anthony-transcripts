<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a giveaway contest for a Bruce Springsteen box set, followed by the playing of tracks from the unreleased *Chef and Friends: The Songs of South Park* CD.  This included memorable performances of  Eric Cartman's rendition of "Come Sail Away" and Chef's "Chocolate Salty Balls."  A call from Aerosmith's Steven Tyler ensued, prompting the reading of a fawning fax from a listener named Phyllis.  The hosts engaged in a discussion about the difficulties of marital fidelity for rock stars.  This transitioned into a lengthy conversation about quitting smoking, with Anthony detailing his personal struggles.

Jim Cook, the personal brewer for Opie and Anthony and founder of Sam Adams, then appeared in studio with a selection of beers, including a Winter Lager and Triple Bock.  Cook shared an anecdote about giving his newborn daughter a taste of Sam Adams beer. Olympic gold medalist Tommy Moe called in, leading to an announcement of a sponsored ski trip to Jackson Hole with Moe, backed by Sam Adams and Dynastar.  The show's giveaway plan for the Bruce Springsteen box set was further elaborated, involving a woman flashing her breasts on the Today Show, with additional stipulations attached.  A listener, Joe, called to declare his participation in the show's "Tuesday Night Hummer Club." The broadcast concluded with further commentary on the *South Park* CD and a visual display of the numerous empty beer bottles accumulated throughout the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, another track from Trax, Bruce Springsteen, Seven Angels, and Sally from Manhattan, she was paying attention, she called up, she was the 20th caller, and she's got her copy of Trax, congratulations Sally, if you don't know what's going on, from now until tomorrow at 6pm, every time we play a Bruce Springsteen song, all you have to do is be the 20th caller, add 212-757-1027, and you too will score the Trax box set, and be a happy girl like she was.  And speaking of new music, you see what I got in front of me, Anthony? 
[00:00:30]  What is that?  South Park.  South Park, what, they got songs?  Yeah, it's the CD, Chef and Friends, the songs of South Park.  I don't care about Chef, I want to hear Cartman.  Well, we can do that, you and I are huge South Park fans.  Yeah.  And Eddie dropped this off for us today, and we were tracking through it, and if you're a South Park fan, I think you're going to enjoy this.  We got Eric Cartman singing Come Sail Away by Styx.  So, we're going to give you a little taste of this, so check this. 
[00:01:00]  I'm sailing away, set an open card for the Virgin Sea, cause I've got to be free, free to face the way, that's ahead of me.  Me? 
[00:01:30]  I'm going to give you a little taste of this, so let me be, we'll search for to marry, on every ship I regret, oh Lord, I'll care.  I'm going to give you a little taste of this, so let me be, we'll search for to marry, on every ship I regret. 
[00:02:00]  He said, yes, we'll search for to marry, on every ship I regret, oh Lord, I'll give you a little taste of this, so let me be.  All right, so you get the idea.  Cartman singing on South Park, Chef and Friends, the songs at South Park doing Come Sail Away.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Matchbox 20, Long Days, Easy Top, Jethro Tull 2.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Thanks.  And we got Steven Tyler calling in within the hour.  Cool.  And we're encouraging you guys to fax in the questions you want us to ask, Steven, at 212-957-WNEW. 
[00:02:30]  I think we got a stalker on our hands.  Uh-oh.  I wish I could call this lady.  If this is your fax, give us a call.  I want to talk to you.  It's Phyllis.  I am 35, 115 pounds, and never miss a chance to get close to you.  What do you say you make my dreams come true and let me spend 15 minutes with you?  I'll meet you anywhere, anytime.  I think you are the true meaning of pure sex, everything a woman dreams of. 
[00:03:00]  Love you more than you can dream.  See you on the 27th of December, Phyllis.  Now, is that for me?  No.  It was, oh, Steven Tyler.  Oh, okay.  No.  No, unfortunately, we don't get faxes like that.  No.  They're signed Bob.  Yeah, exactly.  She wants Steven bad, but she doesn't leave her number or any way, you know, Steven can get  a hold of her.  So, Phyllis, if you're listening, please give us a call.  We want to talk to you on our show today.  I want to see Steven.  It must be just so weird to be a rock star. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  They probably get this all the time.  That'll be great.  Now the boys are married.  Mm-hmm.  All of them, right, I believe, or, yeah, I think there's a couple of little problems in  some of the relationships, but there are little wild times behind them.  But it must be tough.  They're on tour now.  I think they're calling us from Minnesota or somewhere in a hotel room.  They're on tour all the time, and the temptation must be brutal.  Yeah, but after so many years, you know, and giving in to the temptation for so many  years.  I don't think you ever get sick of it.  I'm not saying sick of it, but you just deal with it better. 
[00:04:00]  When do you decide, though?  You know what?  I'm going to play it straight.  I love my wife.  Love my kids.  I'm just going to blow off all these hot chicks.  After you see your wife and kids go down the tubes numerous times, your life in the  crapper, you finally pull it up and say, you know, I better straighten out.  I'm acting like an idiot.  You think they just go for a taste every once in a while, though?  I don't think they can taste anymore. 
[00:04:30]  I don't think it's all or nothing.  Yeah, probably.  It's probably like drugs or anything else.  You know, you take a taste, you're done.  Now you're back in.  We were talking about it earlier with cigarettes.  We heard that it takes 18 years for somebody to quit smoking.  That's the average amount of time it takes a smoker to quit smoking.  18 years.  No, it doesn't.  It takes one minute.  You just stop putting the cigarette in your mouth and lighting it, and you're not smoking.  We're on to this again.  It's done. 
[00:05:00]  Anthony was a major chain smoker.  But, I mean, you go in stages, right?  Over the years?  I had.  I quit once, went back, and then I quit again.  That was it.  But you were out of control, and then one day you decided to, you know, you just didn't  want to do it anymore.  Hang it up.  And you haven't had the urge for a cigarette since?  No, don't even want one.  You just stop doing it.  But I know I can't just go, yeah, I'm going to have a butt.  I'm going to smoke a cigarette.  So what's your advice to the people out there trying to quit smoking, Anthony? 
[00:05:30]  Listen to this philosophy.  It's hysterical.  You just don't smoke.  It's simple advice.  It's to anybody.  Oh, I can't do it.  I don't.  When you pick up a cigarette and put it in your mouth, you're conscious that you're doing  it.  You don't all of a sudden wake up from this fog and go, oh, I'm smoking.  How did this happen?  You had to put the butt in your mouth.  You had to light it.  Inhale.  Do the whole thing.  And you know you're trying to stop smoking.  You know it's bad.  There's a whole thing that goes on.  During any point in that whole thing between picking up the cigarettes and you smoking is 
[00:06:00]  an opportunity to not smoke.  And that's all it takes.  You put it down.  But some people are addicted.  They can't help themselves.  Get through it.  Yeah, it's not easy.  It's not like, oh, well, let me just throw these away.  You have to go and go, oh, I really want one.  But you know something?  Sometimes you can't have everything you want.  So you put the damn cigarettes down and you don't smoke.  It's that easy.  It's not easy, but the concept is that easy. 
[00:06:30]  It's not easy.  It takes some work.  It takes willpower.  But it's that simple.  It's a simple procedure.  But like we were talking about with Steven Tyler and chicks and drugs, you can't go back  to it.  You can't say, eh, this weekend I'm going to have a couple of puffs.  It doesn't work that way.  You just got to stop.  Period.  Are you selling tapes?  Yes.  I quit smoking with Anthony tapes.  I just, you pop in the tape and it goes, put the cigarette down, you ass.  What are you doing?  You're trying to quit. 
[00:07:00]  Simple as that.  1027 WNEW, the rug of New York, George Thurgood.  Days of the New before that, the downtown and Aerosmith doing love in an elevator.  Steven Tyler should be calling within the hour.  I believe it will be about 515 or 520 in case you're waiting for that, okay?  All right.  So, Pete Anthony, also today we got a copy of South Park's CD, Chef and Friends, the  Songs of South Park.  Lovely.  Not many people have this album yet.  I don't even think it's available yet in stores, right? 
[00:07:30]  Oh.  I think we have one of the only copies in New York.  An advanced copy.  People have realized that we are huge South Park fans here.  And people want to hear another track from this, Anthony.  What do we have?  Well, you want to hear Chocolate Salty Balls?  I'm afraid.  What do you mean you're afraid?  It's Chef singing Chocolate Salty Balls.  Oh, we're very excited.  You never know who's going to stop by the studio.  Our pal, Jim Cook. 
[00:08:00]  Jim Cook.  We're going to talk to him next.  Sorry.  1027 WNAW, The Rock of New York.  Goo Goo Dolls and Slide.  Those guys playing tomorrow night at Roseland.  It's a sold-out show.  It's Opie and Anthony.  You never know who's going to stop by the studio.  It's our old pal, Jim Cook from Sam Adams.  The personal brewer for Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  He comes in with a bunch of beer and he's already breaking bottles. 
[00:08:30]  Well, he...  Wait a minute, Jim.  How many you got over there by you?  What, are you afraid we're going to take them?  Yeah.  He's got a six-pack over there.  And he leaves us with a couple of glasses.  Yeah.  And he didn't even fill up our glasses.  I've got to keep you guys under control.  Now, in New York, you're based in Boston, obviously.  Yes.  Now, you're in New York.  How do you get to taste every batch?  When I get back, there's going to be a lot of work piled up.  A lot of making out today.  Is that what it is?  It's like, oh, boy, here's Monday. 
[00:09:00]  That's right.  I'm going to have to work overtime.  I'm going to have to take three six-packs home.  Look at him just slugging the beer.  I like this, man.  I love it.  I like when he visits because we had a couple of visits when we were up in Boston.  And he always brings plenty of beer.  Now, what are we drinking here?  Otherwise, you don't let me in the studio.  I'm like, no beer.  Get his ass out of here.  It's about time someone brought us beer around here.  I know.  But I think we have to try the winter lager because I forgot how it tastes.  Winter lager.  Now, how would you describe this to people? 
[00:09:30]  You obviously know every little word to use to describe the winter lager.  This is a traditional brown ale that's got some winter spices in it.  It's got ginger pulp.  It's got some fresh nutmeg.  It's got a little bit of orange zest in it.  Sort of a nice, warming winter drink.  Sip by the fire.  Sip a winter lager.  Sip another winter lager.  All right.  Wait for the Tuesday event to happen.  You know, Jim, I've known you. 
[00:10:00]  Wait for the Tuesday.  Oh, you heard about our little Tuesday thing already, huh?  You want to open up the Boston chapter for us?  I would love to.  All right.  Enough winter lager.  The Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Are you an official member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club?  No, but I'm waiting to go back and tell my wife about her new membership.  Okay.  Well, we're going to induct new members this coming Tuesday.  So, please give us a call and let us know if you become a member officially, Jim.  All right.  You know, we've known him for a couple of years.  I've never seen his eyes.  I know. 
[00:10:30]  He has that Mr. Magoo look.  He's always squinting.  Yeah, they are.  Hey, okay.  I like the fact that we went down to, he was kind enough to take us down to Turks and Caicos Islands about a year ago, under a year ago.  And we saw him every morning walking down the beach.  And what was he doing?  Eating breakfast?  Maybe sipping some orange juice?  No, none of that nasty fattening junk.  No.  What did you have?  Something wholesome and healthy.  Yeah.  Any hour of the day, Jim's drinking. 
[00:11:00]  It's so weird.  I love this guy.  Yeah.  I think we have your beer to blame for our firing, by the way.  We should get that out of the way.  Well, I will take credit for it.  I'll say we did have a little buzz that day when we said the mayor was dead up in Massachusetts.  Yeah.  That was the dumbest thing.  I know.  I mean, here's the city administration getting their breaking news from the Opie and Anthony show on April Fool's Day.  How dumb is that?  Jim Cook knew it wasn't true.  Yeah.  But, you know, they got a little upset up there. 
[00:11:30]  But we're down here and we're damn happy.  Yeah.  You're lucky.  And now you're down here with the beer.  And it's just weird hearing his voice.  Anthony does, as you know, Jim, a great impression of him.  Well, I used to actually get him in trouble sometimes.  Yeah.  People would call up after you left, like when you were on the air a couple of times ago.  Is Jim still there?  And I'm like, yeah.  Hold on.  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, it's like my grandfather used to say.  Hey, get a lot of chicks with beer.  Did it work for you? 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Actually, it did.  It did.  It works for all of us.  Otherwise, there'd be no babies.  Speaking of babies, that's a good story.  Tell the story of the birth of your daughter or son?  Yeah, my daughter.  Daughter.  Go ahead.  Well, you've got to remember, I am from a brewing family.  I'm actually the sixth oldest son in a row to be a brewmaster.  So beer is kind of in our blood.  And when my daughter was born, it was right there in the delivery room.  Of course, you want to celebrate it with a beer. 
[00:12:30]  And I hate drinking alone.  So she was at least three minutes old.  And I thought, Jesus, poor kid.  All she's going to get for the next year is that nasty, disgusting formula.  I got to give her a beer.  I got to give her a Sam Adams.  So I opened it up, put it on her little lip.  She goes.  And my wife is, what are you doing over there?  What are you doing with that beer?  I'm like, shut up.  Deliver the placenta.  I'll take care of the baby. 
[00:13:00]  Three minutes old.  Drinking beer.  I know.  I don't know why I made her wait so long.  I hate to think of the alternative of how you were going to give it to her any earlier.  I don't even want to get into that.  That's why I'm not saying a word.  I'll just sip some beer.  Now, we got Tommy Moe on the phone, too.  What the hell is going on here today?  Everybody's on Opie and Anthony.  Hey, Tommy.  How you doing?  What's up?  Not too much.  You're talking to Opie and Anthony, and we got our pal Jim Cook. 
[00:13:30]  Excellent.  From Sam Adams in the studio.  How you doing, Jim?  I'm doing great.  We had some of your beer yesterday.  Oh, right.  How was it?  It was delicious.  Tommy came to our brewery in Boston, made a batch of beer with me.  Oh, really?  It was so nice.  We named it Moe Better Beer.  Nice.  Tommy, did you get to drink the beer right out of the hose like Anthony and I did a few years back?  We had quite a few beers there, but I didn't have any from the hose, no.  Yeah, they brought the hose right out of a tank for us.  And we're just sitting there, like, the head over the back of the table, drinking beer. 
[00:14:00]  Tommy Moe, of course, from the U.S. ski team.  Gold medalist.  This is the first time I've ever talked to a gold medalist, Tommy.  Is it?  Yeah.  I won the gold in the downhill in 94 and got a silver medal, too.  Hey, have you ever had sex with a gold medal on?  Sure.  Why?  Sure.  Hey, why not?  I'm serious.  That's got to be great.  Probably just go out with the medals on.  Go to the bar.  Hey, what's up? 
[00:14:30]  Oh, yeah, I see you're talking to that guy, the guy that doesn't have these gold medals.  Yeah.  Jeez, that kind of wrecks you for everyone else at the bar.  Yeah, I just bring it in there, and then when I go to the bar, I just look around and say,  has anybody seen a gold medal laying around?  Is it like a coaster?  You put it on the bar?  Kink!  No, you put it on your belt.  Yeah, you're lucky dogs.  Yeah.  So someone has to explain what the heck is going on.  I mean, you walk in...  Yeah, where's the common denominator here?  Yeah, you walk in with a ton of beer, and then Tommy Moe is on the phone. 
[00:15:00]  I feel like Ronan Martin's laughing when the doors pop open.  Yeah.  What is going on?  I think Ruth Buzzi's going to make her appearance in a few minutes here.  Here's the deal.  Okay.  I think I know it, and if I get it screwed up, they're going to yank me off the air and  sober me up.  Hey, you're the boss.  Screw them.  Good.  I like that attitude.  We're going to give away a ski adventure to your listeners.  You win a trip to Jackson Hole to go skiing with Tommy Moe, who will kick your butt. 
[00:15:30]  Yes, he will.  Well, he's recovering from knee surgery.  How's the knee, Tommy?  Oh, I'm healthy.  Yeah?  Totally healthy, and yeah, we're going to have a grand prize with Sam Adams and Dina Star this  spring, and the grand prize is you're going to take four of your friends along to Jackson  Hole, and we're going to have lots of Sam Adams beer and ski for five days.  And Tommy's representing Dina Star Skis.  Okay.  Now, how do we give this prize away?  Look at everyone.  We're all looking into it.  Quick, drink more beer. 
[00:16:00]  All right, how's this?  We'll drink a couple beers, and we'll figure it out.  I'll drink to that.  All right, Tommy, hold on the line, okay?  Okay.  All right, we got Tommy Moe.  We got Jim Cook, the founder of Sam Adams, and Opie and Anthony, and believe it or not,  Steven Tyler's calling in in about ten minutes or so.  Yeah.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, with ELO.  Fire on high.  It's Opie, it's Anthony, and it's our pal Jim Cook, swinging away over there in the corner. 
[00:16:30]  Founder of Sam Adams, of course.  I love this.  It gives me an excuse to drink on the air.  Well, we got to try out all the beers.  Did we try out everything officially, Jim?  How many flavors did you bring today?  I have to try the hard side.  We just brought two.  Oh, yeah, we did bring hardcore black cider.  So that's new.  Hey, I got a question for you.  Yes.  Is Triple Bock legal in New York?  Yes, Triple Bock is legal in New York, but only as jet fuel.  Explain Triple Bock, because this stuff is sick.  It's delicious.  It's Sam Adams Triple Bock. 
[00:17:00]  It's the strongest beer in the world.  It's about 36 proof.  And it comes in a 250-milliliter bottle, like a port or a sherry.  So it's not what you'd think of as beer.  It really is very much closer to a vintage port or an old cognac.  Yeah, you have to sip it.  Yeah, we were drinking it.  You definitely have to sip it.  Out of the brandy snifter, with a nice Cuban.  Yeah.  You sit there, smoke the cigar, drink a little Triple Bock.  We felt like we were happening.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  How many states is that legal in?  Um, it's illegal in about 10 states.  Illegal in 10 states.  Oh, there's a bottle.  Yeah.  You've got everything.  Look at this.  There's a bottle right there.  There's a bottle of Triple Bock.  Oh, good.  You know, if you open that, this show is going to go downhill real fast.  It's really going to.  Yeah, maybe we've seen open that.  We cannot go downhill.  Come on.  Come on, you know.  Jim stopped by with something really cool.  He's giving away a trip for us, our show here, to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  A trip for two, five nights, lift tickets, round-trip airfare. 
[00:18:00]  Four-wheel drive rental, ski equipment packages by Dynastar, and you get to ski with Tommy  Moe.  Now, the problem is, you're opening up the Triple Bock.  You're nuts.  Oh, my God.  You're crazy.  Oh.  There it is, guys.  Show over.  Done.  We just got to figure out how we're going to give away this trip.  You ski with Tommy Moe?  Yeah, we got 12 people in here drinking Sam Adams, and none of us could come up with a  good idea to give away this great trip, so. 
[00:18:30]  That's great.  You get to look at the back of his head.  How is, like, picture me.  Like, if I won this trip, I'm going to ski with Tommy Moe.  He's not going to spend it.  Tommy, wait up.  There I am on the ground again.  Tommy, could you help me out?  Okay, let's go, Tommy.  Tommy, wait up.  Wait up, Tommy.  No, no, you don't understand.  You just ski regular Tommy skis with a keg of Sam Adams on his back.  Yeah, that'll help.  Not much.  Believe me. 
[00:19:00]  I don't think Tommy wants to spend the afternoon on the bunny hill with you, Anthony.  I know.  That would be awful.  Hey, look, I'm skiing with Tommy.  So, Tommy, how do you use the tow rope?  Give me some pointers.  Embarrassing.  All right, so Jim's hanging out.  He opened up the Triple Bock.  We got, wow, we got a lot of open containers here in the studio.  This is so bad.  But right now, the hotline is ringing.  We got Steven Tyler.  All right.  The show's only getting better.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York. 
[00:19:30]  Billy Idol, Johnny Lang before that.  Still raining.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're hanging with our pal Jim Cook, the founder of Sam Adams this afternoon.  And Steven Tyler called in 20 minutes ago.  We're having a lot of fun today.  I almost feel like we're happening, Opie.  We are happening.  Almost.  I'm just this side of feeling it.  We're getting closer to happening, I think.  Look at all the empties in the studio.  We can blame it.  I know.  That's no lie.  All right.  We can blame it all on Jim.  Yeah, the sponsor came in.  He made us drink the beer.  God, I hate this. 
[00:20:00]  It's so cool to talk to the voice of the commercial.  Yeah, I know.  On the commercials, you're in control, but in real life, you're a mess.  And proud of it.  It's okay.  He just has to know one thing.  Beer.  That's it.  That's all I need to do.  Jim, how many beers do you drink a day?  Because I know you have to, because you've got to taste every batch.  I drink maybe four or five beers a normal day.  Yeah.  But I pace myself. 
[00:20:30]  And, you know, I don't, like, have them all for breakfast.  Now, when you sniff the head, what are you sniffing for?  Does it have to go down this road?  No, no.  The guy is a beer taster as well as the founder, Sam Adams.  I want to know why he sniffs the head.  That's all.  Yeah, we can talk about head in a more elevated fashion.  Sure.  Is it a great show like N.E.W.?  No, I'm sniffing for the hop bouquet.  Because when you pour the beer, you're releasing the bouquet from the hops. 
[00:21:00]  Hops are a flower.  And when you sniff the head, you get that great floral bouquet from the noble hops that come from a small valley north of Munich.  Wow.  See, and I was wondering why he pours it like that.  Because most people pour it on the side of the glass so you don't get a head on it.  He pours it like a Viking.  You know, he's like, there's this big head in the glass.  Yeah, well, Sam Adams has this beautiful, rich, creamy, smooth head. 
[00:21:30]  Everyone loves head, too.  Who doesn't?  That's true.  The guys that sneak the beer down the side of the glass, they get no head.  Every day, it's a new mess on the O.P. Anthony show.  Isn't it?  And we're proud of that.  All right, we got a really cool trip that Jim Cook brought by for us.  It's a trip to Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  Trip for two, five nights, lift ticket, round trip airfare, four-wheel drive rental, ski equipment packages by Dina Starr. 
[00:22:00]  And you get to talk and ski with Tommy Moe.  Where's Tommy?  Tommy!  Tommy Moe!  What's happening?  Hey, what's up?  Not too much.  We're trying to figure out how to give away this trip.  Perfect.  All right.  Give us an idea.  It's like, all right, we've been drinking.  It's up to you.  Tommy Moe, you're on.  I'm on, definitely, yeah.  It should be a fun trip.  It's going to be out in Jackson, and I'm looking forward to it.  Well, Anthony wants to ski with you, but he hasn't graduated from the bunny hill yet. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, come on out.  We'll make some big turns.  He loves skiing with people that can't ski.  He's like, oh, you've got to go back and pick this idiot up.  Hi, Tommy.  Tommy, look, I'm skiing.  I'm low.  Oh, could you pick me up, Tommy?  Tommy, I'm snow plowing.  Look.  You're snow plowing.  You got a lot of muse.  I think you got to win another gold medal, Tommy.  Oh, yeah, definitely.  Where are you now?  Colorado?  Yeah, I'm out in Colorado. 
[00:23:00]  Do you ever go to a place that's like Florida?  Oh, yeah.  Where you have to go somewhere and you're like, I've got to ski.  No, actually, I've been all over.  I go to the tropics all the time in the spring and summer, and I enjoy getting out and getting  away from the snow anyway.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Tommy, what did you think about Sonny Bono and Mike Kennedy?  That was kind of tragic.  That was kind of a blur to the ski industry because, I don't know, two super famous people  got killed skiing.  It's just really hard to hit a tree, though, skiing. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  It's a dangerous sport, though.  A lot of times people don't think it's dangerous, but you're going fast and there's nothing holding  you back and you can get injured fast.  Well, Kennedy with the football thing was pretty stupid.  Yeah, why?  You wouldn't do that.  No, I wouldn't play football when I'm on the slopes.  No, okay.  Kennedy's in there football.  You know how we should give away the trip?  The first girl that, you know, flashes her boobs at the Today Show.  Oh, come on.  We can't do that.  Do we have to give it away today, Jim?  No.  Look at you.  And explain that one we're doing. 
[00:24:00]  Well, you know, the Today Show has their live segment.  They go out into a street right by Rockefeller Center here in New York, and Al Roker does  the weather, and he talks to these people from Tennessee and whatever that hold their big  signs up.  And we're looking for a girl that shows up at the show, gets Al Roker over there with  the mic, on camera, live, on TV, national television, and opens up her shirt and expose  her breasts on national television. 
[00:24:30]  And we already have $1,000 that we're giving her out.  We're going to give it to the first girl that does that.  Maybe we could throw in the ski trip, too.  Can you possibly sanction this?  Of course.  Can you sanction this, Jim?  Look at your people.  Your handlers are all going on.  Don't leave it to Jim.  He's got 18 bottles of beer open in front of him.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Well, she has to have Samuel Adams tattooed.  Okay.  Sam Adams on one mogul, and Opie and Anthony on the other mogul. 
[00:25:00]  I understand now.  It's a whole thematic thing.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll talk about it.  We'll see.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Pearl Jam from 10.  That's black.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  And it's Jim Cook, the founder of Sam Adams.  And on the line, we've got another person that joined our club, Anthony.  Oh.  Would you like to talk to them?  Of course.  Jim, would you like to talk to someone that has joined the club?  I'm always pleased to hear about Great Head.  He was talking about his beer, of course. 
[00:25:30]  Of course.  Everyone knows that.  Hi.  Who's this?  Hey.  How you doing?  It's Joe.  Hey, Joe.  What's going on?  Not much, man.  I just want to call.  Thank you guys for Tuesday.  Oh.  You're a member of the club, huh?  Absolutely, man.  I get home.  All right.  You've got to be careful how you describe this.  I understand.  Get home.  Anywhere that's going to get us in trouble, just go, wah, wah.  Got it.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Eat dinner and, you know, nothing really much better.  Who's dinner?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought that was a name.  Continue.  Watching a little TV after dinner. 
[00:26:00]  My wife goes to me, you listened to Amy W today?  And I was like, yeah.  And she goes, oh, so, you know, you don't want to become a member of the club?  You didn't say anything.  And I was like, well, you know, I didn't really know how to say it.  And she's like, well, you know, if you want to become a member, you know, why don't we just, you know, go on upstairs?  And then she goes, you're going to call them and tell them?  Well, there you go.  You're telling us.  What's her lovely name?  Her name's Devin.  Devin, what's yours?  Rick.  Rick.  And where are you guys from?  Long Island.  Hey, congratulations. 
[00:26:30]  What town?  Town?  Levitown.  Oh, cool.  All right.  We're Huntington boys, me and Ed.  Grew up there, actually.  I like that.  The fact that he got it because we said it's Tuesday Night Hummers.  Mm-hmm.  And we want to be to Hummers what Jim Cook is to be here.  That's all.  That's all we're trying to do.  Make the world a better place.  Yeah, you can make lots of long necks, too.  Absolutely, guys.  All right, man.  Well, congratulations.  Thanks again.  Remember, the club beats every Tuesday night. 
[00:27:00]  Absolutely.  All right, brother.  Take care.  Thanks, man.  Did you say meats?  Oh, okay.  I thought you said something else.  All right.  Well, Jim, do you have any final words?  You know.  No, just keep going.  You guys have a great time.  You and me have the best job in the world.  Yeah.  I don't doubt that.  We do the same thing.  We try to make people happy.  Well, you'd do a better job at it.  Because you're making us happy.  Not much makes us happy.  All right. 
[00:27:30]  And we're going to figure out how to give away this trip.  But we'll come up with something really good.  Really good.  Instead of just, you know, doing something stupid while we're drunk.  1027 WNEW.  The Rock of New York.  Marcy Playground.  Sex and Candy.  Pink Floyd before that.  It's O.P. and Anthony.  Lots going on on the show today.  Got to thank Jim Cook, the founder of Sam Adams, for stopping by.  That's fun.  And we got to thank Stephen Tyler from Aerosmith for calling in.  That was very cool as well.  Yeah.  We got to get him in here, though.  He said on the phone that he will get in here. 
[00:28:00]  Mm-hmm.  So I'm looking forward to that.  Yeah.  All right.  Don't forget, we're still doing the Bruce Springsteen thing as well.  Lots going on at the station.  When you hear Bruce Springsteen, if you're the 20th caller at 212-757-1027, you will score  the box set tracks.  Rock.  We're going to do that until tomorrow at 6.  And then all weekend long, you've got chances to win tickets to see Kiss.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, Stevie Ray Vaughan, and Cold Shot.  Lenny Kravitz before that.  His latest, Fly Away, and some Queen, too. 
[00:28:30]  It's O.P. and Anthony.  Let's welcome Suffolk County Police Department to our listeners, O.P., out on Long Island.  They always listen to us, I thought.  Well, no, they're getting radios in their Crown Victorious and their police cruisers.  And news they wrote about it.  Mm-hmm.  But, of course, they don't mention us.  No.  It's like now they could listen to Mike and the Bat Dog.  That's a crime.  They might as well listen to that.  That is a crime. 
[00:29:00]  If you want to talk about how the Yankees, you know, re-signed David Cohn for 20 hours  in a row.  I like the idea, though, that a cop might not respond to an accident fast enough because  he's got to hear if the guy we're talking to got a Hummer on Tuesday.  That's good.  Welcome Suffolk.  Well, we know we have a lot of cops that listen to us already.  We love the police.  And Anthony has a few cop friends.  And what do they do?  They have a little code when we're doing something funny for the rest of the guys on patrol?  Yeah, they do.  They yell out, we've got a 1027. 
[00:29:30]  And that means tune in to any W.  Opie and Anthony are doing something demented.  I like that.  Cool.  Man, I wanted to get to this earlier, but I got another telemarketer call.  You did?  Yes.  All right.  What is this one?  Well, like everyone, I am so sick of people calling me when I'm trying to eat.  You know, we get home from work pretty late, and usually the first phone call is somebody  trying to sell me something.  And I've had it, and I've begged them to stop calling, and they refused. 
[00:30:00]  So now I've turned the tables, and I record the telemarketers, and I mess with them, and  I have some fun with it.  And then I bring it in here, and we play it on the air.  Why not?  In the past, we played the cabinet one.  Where you were slamming your hands in cabinets, and pots and pans were falling on you.  Yeah.  Okay.  I like that one.  What was the other one we did?  Oh, the guy who was trying to give me a credit card.  And I told him I never graduated high school, and I asked him if I could buy crack with the  credit card they were trying to, you know, sell me. 
[00:30:30]  And he was still trying to give it to you.  Yes.  Yeah.  Well, this guy called me this morning.  He wanted to sell me a new roof.  How does he know you need a roof?  Well, he doesn't know I need a new roof.  They just call enough people, and, you know, finally, someone will take the B.  I need a roof.  The senile old man with the kids goes, Dad, you bought a roof, but you're saving.  Oh, the poor elderly.  Well, I got back to this telemarketer. 
[00:31:00]  Okay.  We got umbrellas set up everywhere to trap the water into buckets.  Yeah.  Okay, sir.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Stay dry.  All right.  Bye-bye.  You're a bastard, man.  Oh, I'm a bastard.  Like the telemarketers aren't bastards?  Buy a roof from the guy.  Actually, I got another one that I could break out.  What?  The sperm bank call is really funny, too.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York.  There you have it, the latest from the Black Crows. 
[00:31:30]  We've been playing that for a while now, kicking my heart around.  And I was informed today the new CD's going to be out in January?  Is it January?  Yeah.  Can I start dubbing copies of the CD I got and pass them out to people?  You don't have a CD.  You do not have a complete Black Crows CD.  Then what were we listening to on the way in today?  I have no idea what that was, but you don't have it.  Because you're not supposed to have it.  Oh.  It's very bad if you have something like that.  Oh. 
[00:32:00]  Oh.  Well, if I had another beer, I'd start playing all the tracks off it.  Shut up.  What?  Shut up.  Shut up.  I thought we were just trying to do a radio show here.  What happened?  It's going to get us in trouble.  If you're going to be a rebel, you know.  Where is my CD?  I'll play it right now.  No, you won't.  It's in your car.  I swear.  I swear it's in Anthony's car.  I'm not just acting cool.  Damn it.  Thank God.  I swear it's in your car.  Well, we'll be cranking it on the way home today.  Yes.  All right. 
[00:32:30]  Well, thanks for listening today.  We had a lot of fun.  Once again, Matt DeVote is up next.  Got to thank Jim Cook, founder of Sam Adams, for coming by.  Matt, you see all the empties in the studio?  Just in case there's an affidavit.  People that don't believe it.  It's like the old days when Scott Muni used to do his radio show.  Scott was getting done with his show.  What are we looking at here?  This is at least, what, two, three dozen bottles all over the...  At least.  Unreal.  I figured if Scott Muni could have this many empties for 15 straight years, I think Anthony 
[00:33:00]  and I could get away with doing it one day.  So this guy's for real.  Yeah.  Jim Cook's for real.  He's a real person.  Oh, you didn't see his eyes, huh?  No.  I'm racing up 56.  I was trying to get him, you know, I wanted to see him.  He said he had those Mr. Magoo eyes.  Fake time.  Fake time.  It's like my great-grandfather used to say.  If you make a brewery, you'll get chicks to give you head.  Or you could give head to chicks.  I'm talking of my nice, creamy head on my Sam Adams. 
[00:33:30]  So thick you could float a bottle cap on it.  The guy was sauced.  That was correct.  I always thought he was like the Willy Wonka of the beer industry.  He pretty much is.  He was inside the factory.  You didn't know if it was real or not.  Yeah.  He's legit.  Get the Oompa Loompas to bring up another K.  The Oompa Loompas, man, they roll around because they're drunk.  That's why.  He's like, turn purple and fall over, but it ain't because I can be. 
[00:34:00]  He's a really good friend of ours.  That's cool, man.  Yeah, he's a great guy.  That's a good friend to have, right?  And Steven Tyler sounded great.  He did, right?  I can't believe they're coming to the Meadowlands right around Christmas time.  That's it.  Unbelievable.  Good show.  He was a lot of fun, too.  Excellent.  I guess we're going to end our show with Cartman singing Come Sail Away.  Did you hear that earlier?  Everyone yelled at us because we didn't let the song, you know, play all the way through.  I love his little sentimental soft side.  I like this song.  He's like whispering the whole thing.  All right.  Well, yeah, we got this today, too.  Another CD we're not supposed to have. 
[00:34:30]  Is Stinky Britches on there or whatever it's called?  The chef song about his chocolate salty balls.  We play that as well.  Oh, my gosh.  But I got to get a hold of that.  Yeah, we're not supposed to have this, but off the South Park Chef and Friends, the songs  of South Park CD came in today.  I don't know how we got it, but we got it.  Here's Cartman singing Come Sail Away, and we will let it play through.  All right. 
[00:35:00]  Sorry. </pre>
