<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious rant about a "fat fuck" who had destroyed two chairs, including Opie's, and rearranged the studio furniture, leaving behind a disgusting smell.  The hosts speculated wildly about the culprit's identity amongst those with post-show studio access, using highly vulgar language throughout this segment. The conversation then abruptly shifted to Charles Barkley's controversial comments about the size of women in San Antonio, sparking a debate about obesity, body image, and the limits of comedic commentary on weight.  Callers phoned in, offering diverse opinions on Barkley's remarks and the hosts' own language. One caller's story about a coworker loudly listening to the show at work became another target of the hosts' humor. The show briefly reviewed the FX series *Fargo*, praising Billy Bob Thornton's performance, before concluding with a montage of Reverend Al Sharpton struggling with a teleprompter.

The next segment focused on the last day of female intern, Angelica.  The hosts discussed her quiet demeanor, speculating about a hidden fiery personality. A listener called in to criticize their use of the phrase "in this day and age," which was briefly addressed.  The main focus, however, remained on a confrontation between Angelica and another intern, Adrian, involving accusations of laziness, rudeness, and passive-aggressiveness from both sides.  Other staff members, Eric and Sal, contributed their perspectives, escalating the conflict.  Angelica's boyfriend, who works on the Staten Island Ferry, was mentioned, leading to a detour into discussions about the ferry and a past ferry crash.  Angelica's perfume also became a topic of conversation. The segment concluded with a discussion of Robert Plant's decision not to tour with Led Zeppelin, interspersed with banter about other musicians, a listener's song request ("Big Log"), and a detailed analysis of an 80s music video.  The segment ended with a Led Zeppelin song.

The following segment started with a discussion of a Robert Plant song sampled by P. Diddy, quickly transitioning into a critique of past "food segment" failures. The hosts ranted extensively about the numerous failed attempts to secure promised food items from guests, specifically targeting a Cronut maker and his wife with vulgar insults. They reminisced about past segments, including a "money snatch" bit involving women and their vaginas, which is now banned.  The conversation touched upon upcoming guests, including Dominic (scheduled for June), and the possibility of a "barbecue week." A video clip showing a surprise appearance by Hugh Jackman during an interview, where a Cronut was presented, was analyzed. Jim Norton's reaction to the video was highlighted. The segment ended with continued complaints about the Cronut maker, the lack of a new studio, criticisms of their agent, and a bizarre news story about a Houston serial defecator.  A past "Stalker Patty" segment involving a naked woman and mousetraps was also mentioned.

The final segment began with a game where staff member Patty searched for hidden checks totaling $2000, accompanied by crude jokes from the hosts.  The discussion then moved to the novelty song "Detachable Penis," evoking humorous memories and listener requests. Sal rushed into the studio upon the mention of "penis."  A large portion of the show was dedicated to a scathing review of the documentary "We Always Lie to Strangers," filmed in Branson, Missouri, which the hosts found incredibly disappointing and boring.  A caller, Billy, offered a historical perspective on Branson's decline from its 90s heyday.  The show concluded with a lengthy and graphic discussion of the Vice documentary "Last Chance High," detailing violence and unruly behavior at a Chicago high school for troubled youth, using offensive language. The hosts ended with plugs for upcoming Cumia family performances and E-Rock's delayed movie project, along with final banter.

Every once in a while we gotta do some house cleaning  Before we do an official radio show 
[00:01:30]  Sweep up a little, a little dusting  Here's today's house cleaning  Some fat fuck broke my fucking chair in the studio  Jesus H. Christ  What fat fuck sits here after I sit here?  Alright, there's a few fat fucks around  Which fat fuck it is, I'm pissed off  Fat fuck  It might be one of those fat fucks I actually like  A fat fuck  But there's a fat fuck that broke my fucking chair  That's not very politically correct 
[00:02:00]  There's only a couple things that we need every day  Fat fucks?  To do a radio show  We're in a fucking shitty studio  We all know that  And eventually, maybe in the year 2030  When Russia colonizes the moon  They'll also fix our fucking studio  So we accept the fact that the studio is shitty  But I'm not gonna accept the fact that some fat fuck  Continues to break shit in our studio  And the other thing that bothers me is the headphones  But we're good with that  That's two things that we need 
[00:02:30]  We need the headphones to sound the same every day  Because it throws you off as a radio guy  And we want a chair that isn't broken by a fat fuck  So which fat fuck sits in my fucking chair, Sam?  Uh-oh  It was Travis  Sam?  No, Travis has his own problem with fat fucks  Sam, uh, Travis said his chair, uh, overnight  Somebody ripped the arm off of it  My chair is completely broken  I'm trying to fix it right now 
[00:03:00]  But  What goes on after we leave?  I have no idea  How many fat fucks are in this studio after we leave?  Alright, well  Let's count  Fuck!  And I'll tell you another thing  This chair fucking smells  Because fat fucks smell  Oh!  We all know it  Fat fucks can't keep their asses clean enough  Damn  There's a fucking smell coming off this goddamn chair right now  So how do I fix that?  Wow, you got some Lysol over there or something? 
[00:03:30]  Yeah, but it's not  I don't feel like having to spray down someone's fat fuck smells  Oh, man  There's cake on my chair  There is cake on your chair  Yeah, good for you  I got a chair that doesn't even fucking work properly  And then Travis's is completely busted  Now I have no arms on my chair  I have to put my arms in my car  What happened?  You don't have arms on your chair  I don't know  Sam said that's his chair  So I don't know where mine is  All the chairs have been moved and broken by fat fucks  This chair doesn't feel like my chair  So I'm wondering if this chair was your chair 
[00:04:00]  They broke it and then brought that one in  Because this does not feel like my chair  Ah!  The fuck?  You're right  When I was doing the pre-show  It felt different  And I did notice the arm rattling next to it on the floor  This chair either feels different or it's fucking broken  It's exactly what they did  They broke your chair  Whose chair did they break?  Yours  Then they brought your chair into the studio there  Right  Brought that chair into here  Which isn't your chair so it's fucked up  Do you want to test this chair?  Do you want me to bring it in?  Travis, did your chair have a broken thing on the side? 
[00:04:30]  Yes  Yeah  On the right side, right?  Yes  Yes, it did  So those fucking...  Fuck!  They broke my fucking chair and then moved everyone's chairs around and thought no one would notice  That's exactly what happened  You want me to bring you your broken chair?  How the fuck do you break a chair?  I don't know  Because you're a fat fuck  They broke two chairs  Two chairs  Because that chair's arms are broken  Because they broke the arms on that chair  Right  And then the chair you're in is also broken right now 
[00:05:00]  Yeah  Urine  What the fuck goes on?  We've never broken a chair  But where's the chair I usually sit in?  You don't have arms  I have no arms on the chair  I have no arms on the chair  My arms are just hanging  I always have arms  Do you always have arms, Opie?

I don't know  Finger with a nice dollop of whipped cream  At the end of it?  I don't know  Fat fuck  But how fat do you have to be  Where you just break the whole  Right side of a chair  Where it's hanging 
[00:08:30]  That is amazing  And then you move chairs around  And hope no one notices  That's got to be embarrassing  And why do you leave  The arm of the chair hanging?  I don't know  And how do you think  That somebody who is notorious  For relaxing on his elbows  Which I have become  You are notorious for that  That there's no arms on my chair  Everyone says  It went away  Fuck  How can they expect a quality show  If I can't just rest my elbows?  Yes  Paula  How are your elbows?  Very, very floaty  Look, this business has had fat fucks  Since the first time 
[00:09:00]  Someone turned on a microphone  Okay  Dude  Let me tell you a little  Let me tell you a quick story  About the Opster  When I was at WCMF in Rochester  Rochester's home of rock and roll  Okay  Wow  I was just a part-time loser  But one of my jobs  Now you're full-time  Thank you  One of my jobs  Given to me by the program director  And I'll even say his name  Stan Main  Who taught me a lot about this fucking business  And then I did everything, you know, differently 
[00:09:30]  The other way around  Then I became a huge superstar  That's how it works  That's how it does work  But he did teach me the basics  He sat me down and he goes  Look, between me and you  There is nothing  I need to do  I need you to do something  The guy on After You  You know he's a fat fuck  I'm saying fat fuck now  But he said, you know, he's a very large gentleman  And this guy had an amazing  Great big fat person  Oh, he sounded like the dude  Ted Williams  Yeah  Probably better  He had one of those fucking amazing voices 
[00:10:00]  You know you love it  Right  He weighed well over 400 pounds  My job every weekend  Before he came in after me  Was to lock all the chairs  From the studio in a closet  Wow  Because this guy  Was breaking chairs left and right as well  Fat fucks break chairs  They do  They do  That was really my job  For a while  And the guy would always come in  He was well over 400 pounds  Big, huge black guy 
[00:10:30]  He would always ask me  Hey man, you know, where are the chairs?  Where are the chairs, motherfucker?  And I would have to lie  And go, I don't know  They weren't here when I got here  Yeah  But I had to lock them up  And then  I guess  I guess the program director  Told the guy  After this guy  You know  To go get him  And, you know  Bring him back into the studio  After he left  Well, they got a weight problem  What's a motherfucker supposed to do?  I don't know  People are saying 
[00:11:00]  I should do something about this  Uh-oh  I should  I should  I don't know  Oh, shit  Get over it  All this writing  And crying  Get you to think  Get over it  Get over it  Did you ever fail at your duties  And have him break a chair?  I don't remember  Honestly, I don't remember  Because it's so many years ago  But I do remember the part  Where I definitely, you know  Put the chairs in the closet 
[00:11:30]  Did you ever smell the seat?  Oh, boy  Oh, yeah  Oh, fuck, yeah  I said a funny line years ago  He was talking about  Did you ever smell the seat  Of a fat guy?  Such an obnoxious thing to say  Because it captures  All their fat fuckness  All that  So then when you sit in it  It kind of wafts up  It just gives you a little  Poof  Out of the cushion  Cushion's been holding  All of that goodness  But maybe they could explain 
[00:12:00]  How they broke that one chair  And then moved all the chairs around  And assumed no one would notice  That would be nice  Thank you  Thought they'd get away with it  Fuck  Well, good morning  What's the fat fuck?

You can't leave a birthday cake  On the turf  That would be epic fail  So I picked it up 
[00:14:30]  And I tried to chase you  Around the building  And then I went back outside  And then you went up  Behind the barrier  And then met the unexpected  I did go outside the barrier  Then a total stranger  Saw Elizabeth  When she was running by  Like the waitress on the cover  Of the Super Tramp album  She's running by  With the cake like this  And then this guy  Grabs the cake  And smashes it  Into his own face  Fucking E-Rock  I later asked him  Why'd he do that?  And he said  Well, nobody else did  He was actually a guy  I think his name is E-Rock  From the opening  Of the Anthony show  Yes  Next door  He had a lot of  All the Rivera's tequila

Oh, good  He's amazing  Yeah, Barkley has no filter  And he's untouchable  That's good for him  I don't think he's actually  I think he might have apologized  In the past  I think he might have had to  I'm not positive about that  But I feel like Barkley  Has apologized  He said that thing  About sports writers years ago  They're just fat old white guys 
[00:16:30]  Or whatever  And people got mad at him for that  But I don't know  I don't know if he ever apologized  Right  And he said that he likes  To use the N-word  Amongst his friends  Right  Yep  Just like me  Well, he's an honest  He's an honest broadcaster  He's more honest  Than most of them out there  Yeah  He's got some balls  So Barkley went after  Fat women in San Antonio  Or he was talking about them  Yeah, he was just talking about  How big the women are  In San Antonio  Alright  Apparently they are  I go to Portland  I'm going to get all the free  Nike stuff I want  If I go to San Antonio 
[00:17:00]  I'm going to get a bunch of churros  Wait, what kind of women  Are in San Antonio?  Some big old women down there  Why would you say that?

[00:18:00]  Ernie, would you eat fish out of there?  Nobody eats fish out of there  That's my point  Well, if it was a river, you would eat fish out of it  You might eat fish out of there  That's hilarious  There's a reason we don't  And this is the problem  They have these shows  They want guys to be guys  Right  We want guy talk  We want to catch men  And then they act like guys  Right  And fucking people cry about it  And someone's got an issue  That was a perfect example  Of just guys laughing at funny shit  And being funny, yeah  Right  Not being hateful  There's no hate in that 
[00:18:30]  Get some jokes  And it comes from a guy  That is considered fat, by the way  His playing days, even  They would comment  Yeah, a little pudgy  Yeah  Barkley would be considered fat  Look at him compare to everybody else on that panel  Well, his head's very fat  I know he's got that big, round, Charlie Brown-shaped head  He would be considered fat  To be completely honest with you  So  Is there anything else in the clip?  No  He's just insulting fat women in the river walk  And so who needs the apology on this one?  Who complained? 
[00:19:00]  It has to be fat women that are apologizing, right?  Yes  Okay  Making slurs about body size  Slur  Is just as offensive as making comments about body color  Ah, shut up  Said the spokeswoman  Or spokesperson  I'm sorry, I'm sorry  Hey  You can't say spokes  You can't even point to the guys  Spokes thing  Spokes monster  Yeah  You can't even  The spokes too fat to tell what it is  You can't even point out if they have a dick or a pussy anymore  No  Right  That's where we're at 
[00:19:30]  That quote is from the spokesperson of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance  Come on  What?  That's true  That's true  The N double  What?  I don't think you should ever accept fat  No, it's unhealthy  Because it's unhealthy  And then  The N double cheeseburger  Then the president of the Obesity Action Coalition  Which is really  What a fucking  I wish I knew what those two words  They're the opposite 
[00:20:00]  But I can't  I'm not clever enough to know what that is  What a something that is  The Obesity Action  There should be some fucking action  That's right  Maybe in their step  Has walked to the fridge and back  Yes  End of communication  Come on  Yeah, their president said  As a former NBA player and sports entertainment figure  Mr. Barkley should encourage equality and respect among society  And not look to shame or segment one population 
[00:20:30]  All these catchphrases  These words  These keywords  Trigger words  Slur  Oh, he said  Was that a slur?  He shamed them  He said  Obesity is a serious medical condition  And not a joking matter  Shut it  It is a joking matter  How about the fact that people aren't doing what they're supposed to do to help themselves  Yes  Yeah, don't tell anyone what a joking matter is, by the way  Yeah, exactly  Don't tell me  Fat people have been funny since the beginning of funny  Oh  I love comedy  That was hilarious  Barkley was just being hilarious there 
[00:21:00]  And having a good time  Alcohol addiction, drug addiction  Those are serious things  You can't make fun of those either  So now we can't make fun of any type of addictive behavior  Come on, stop it  Fat people will never get the clout that black people and Asians and the gay  They'll never get that where people seriously don't make fun of them  And don't use what they deem slurs, you know  People don't understand the basics of comedy  Where  I mean  That's great  Yeah, it's always at someone's expense  Right  When you're laughing, it's because it's at someone's expense 
[00:21:30]  Period  Yeah  That's where comedy begins  Does that mean you can't laugh at  Like when the  You know the slapstick shit  Where you take a hammer and like three stooges  And you hit someone over the head  It's hilarious  It's stealing money in a subway platform  Apparently that's happening  But there is a person getting hit over the fucking head  And it hurts  Yeah  But everyone else laughs  A fat person slipping and falling on their ass  Hilarious  It's hilarious  Sorry  Funnier than a skinny person 
[00:22:00]  There's a reason for that  Because they're fat  Oh god  But they also don't realize that they're being overweight  I don't care if you're overweight  But it inconvenes other people when you travel  It certainly does  Right  I don't want to pay your medical costs  And they're ignoring the fact that it came from Charles Barkley  Who is known for being chubby in the NBA  And he would absolutely be considered fat  That's funny  Fucking Victoria's Secret  It's a big secret there  Right  Bloomers wearing big bloomers  Mike on Long Island 
[00:22:30]  Hey, what's up fellas  Mike  You saw the round mound of rebound  No?  Wasn't that his nickname?  Yeah, it was something like that  The mound round of rebound  I think you're right  That was Charles Barkley's nickname in the NBA  He struggled with his weight  He always struggled with his weight  He was known to be a bit chubby  And that's when he was in shape shape  Right  He was the shape he was looking for  It was a circle  Yeah, he was very, very roundish  Good one  Thank you, Mike  Alright, take care  Yeah, let's go to Pete in Texas  Pete  Pete  Hey, fellas

Because they all drive out in L.A.  Of course  Los Angeles is the next one  I'm surprised though  Because everyone looks good in L.A.  They're all healthy looking  But they drive so much  Nobody walks anywhere  That's probably a big  They got like soft asses 
[00:25:00]  Because they don't walk as much  Aren't you noticing a trend here  With these cities?  No  I am  Louisville  Black  Kentucky is  I've just seen black again  Tulsa  80% of black women are obese  By the way  No  Why do you even know that statistic?  80%?  80%  Why do you have to know that statistic?  Why do you know that statistic?  Because that's up in the numbers  In these very black oriented cities  Ups the numbers  Yeah but towns like Miami  Indianapolis  I don't even know if they're on there  But they're not known for black women  Of course they're  I'm not saying every single city 
[00:25:30]  But when you look at cities like  You know  Baltimore  Detroit  Cleveland  A lot of these places are  Predominantly black cities  And black women tend to  Way  They're way over the national average  Well Miami  Indianapolis  And Philadelphia  Are probably on this list  And they're the next  They're the next three on the list  I'm a good guesser  You're not  You have any other  Do you have a guess for the next one?  No  You read it 
[00:26:00]  Arlington  Arlington's good  But the people in Columbus are worse  But Arlington's okay  That's the next one  Columbus is the next one  Charlotte  Phoenix  New Orleans  Atlanta  Phoenix  They're all attractive in Phoenix  Yeah  Yes  Phoenix is the best looking people in the world  Are we allowed to say that though?  Because that's a good stereotype  You're allowed to say the good stereotypes  I've been to Phoenix a couple times  And everyone is pretty beautiful  Yeah  There's a lot of good looking women in Phoenix  Yeah  Oh fuck yeah  If they start saying Chicago and Dallas 
[00:26:30]  This list is over for me  I'm not interested  New Orleans  Bullshit  Raleigh  Kansas City  St. Louis  Chicago  And then Dallas  So how many Texas cities on the top 25?  I went to Phoenix, Arizona  All the way to Tacoma  You did?  Philadelphia  Atlanta  LA  Northern California  That's a lot of cities man  Yeah  For one trip  Keep on a rockin' me babe  Four  Steve Miller  Four Texas cities  Yeah  Four  Five  Dallas, Houston, Arlington  And San Antonio 
[00:27:00]  Houston  San Antonio's not even on the list?  No  What happened?  It's 26  So four of the top 25 are in that one state  Texas  I don't know  I think these fat groups are not helping their people  Not at all  To try to get acceptance for that  Because then it just gives people an excuse to go  Look, I don't have  Big is beautiful  Makes people mad at him  But inside it's not beautiful  It's doing a world of hurt 
[00:27:30]  So you're not helping people  It's doing a world of hurt  And on the outside even  For a fetish  People think it's beautiful  Things like that  Oh, she's got a pretty face  Think it's beautiful  But for the most part  It does not fit the norm  Of what people consider beautiful  So shut the fuck up  Lie to yourself  When you look at your fat face in the mirror  But the truth of the matter is  Fat is not beautiful  You're a fetish  You're a fucking fetish  And it's a choice in a lot of cases  Exactly  Because I always hear people go  Well, you know, I eat healthy 
[00:28:00]  And then I see them eat  And it's like, you're not  Yeah  I fucking hate eating healthy  It stinks  I got it  Well, that Mexican food came in the other day  I want it to literally just put my hands in my own asshole  And then eat it with like a bird  Dude, I look fucking delicious  I want bacon every day with some nice home fries  I got another shitty fucking blueberry banana oatmeal skim milk smoothie  That's what I'm going to drink for breakfast today  That sounds good  Delicious  You think I want to do this every day? 
[00:28:30]  Hell fucking no  I love bacon  I would love to eat bacon right now  You'd be amazing  I cut out all my eggs and bacon in the morning now  Did you?  You did  I'd just been drinking one thing of orange juice every morning  That's all I have now for breakfast  That's impossible  No, no, I did  I swear  No, I've seen them do the orange juice  No, I haven't had any  But why no egg whites?  I eat egg whites from avocado  Nothing  Are you trying to get your body back together for summer?  I'm getting back in a fucking pool form  I'm getting back into shape  You gotta eat breakfast though  I eat, well, like when I get home 
[00:29:00]  I'll eat a little something  Try driving a car with no fuel  Aw shit  Wow  Nice  The OJ's good for, you know  Keeping the chemical levels right and everything  That's nice  And then I go home and decide to eat something  I would be shaking if I didn't eat in the morning  No, just a glass of OJ doesn't do it?  Fuck no  I'd be shaking  My stomach bothered me  I'd have fucking reflux burps  Oh, Jimmy  I work out like every day  I got a trainer now  That's busting my ass 
[00:29:30]  It's hard work  It's not fun  No  It's not fun  It's not fun  Best part of the workout is when you're done  Right  That's the best part  Yay, I'm done  And it's not easy  I've been with this trainer for two and a half months  I've only lost eight pounds  And we're working fucking hard  Because, you know, being older  The metabolism slows the fuck down  So it's harder to lose the weight  So I get it  It's not easy  But at least fucking try  Gotta take a stab at it  You gotta at least try  Your fatties 
[00:30:00]  But they'd rather  Instead of taking the effort and time  And work to lose the weight  They'd rather put a group together  That looks around for people  That are making fun of fat people  Right  I've never seen one fatty  That's lost the weight  That was happier fat  Or has some pride in being fat  It's always when they're fat  And then they're going  You know, I don't have to lose the weight  This is beautiful  This is who I am  And the second they do lose that weight  They're like  Oh, I'm so glad I did this 
[00:30:30]  I should have done this sooner  Right  It's an excuse  Yeah, because no one's talking about  10 or 15 pounds  Yes  It's obesity  Don't let it know  And you're continuing to eat  You're continuing to do the action  Right  And people around you are enabling you  So stop making excuses  And trying to get groups together  So we all have to look at it  And go, oh, that's healthy  Take your group  Get them together  And go for a fucking jog  Let's focus on San Antonio  We got listeners down there  And they're calling right now  Jack in San Antonio  Jack  I don't blame them  What do you think about what Charles Barkley said? 
[00:31:00]  He's absolutely fucking right  The biggest fat fucks in the world are here  Oh, man  All they do is cram tacos down their throats  For breakfast, lunch, and dinner  And they want to know why their kids  Clip in at 300 pounds  Charles is right  Fattest fucks in the world here  Right  All right  Fattest fucks in the world  Well, we support  It's on the sign  Oh  We support Charles Barkley 
[00:31:30]  I didn't hear any hate  In his San Antonio fat women rant  No  All the guys at the table  Were laughing their asses off  Certainly were  Charles Barkley is known to be  A pretty damn funny guy  Isn't it weird though?  You watch a clip like that  And you just start thinking like  Uh-oh  Right  Like I thought it was really funny  Right  As I'm watching it  But you also get this feeling like  Uh-oh  Oh boy  Right  Like that's with every clip  That is somewhat 
[00:32:00]  Oh, controversial  Of course  Crazy  There was no hate in there  He was going for  Joke after joke after joke  He's very funny  Right  That was some funny fat shit  And he tips the scales  Pretty up there  Mr. Barkley does  We want guys  But we don't want them  To act like guys  Oh  Fucking guys  Oh no  Sports talk is  Ridiculous  They're all in as being  You know  Pussies  Oh the worst dude  They have become the worst at this  There's a few exceptions  I believe Toucher and Rich 
[00:32:30]  Are probably doing alright  And you know  Keeping it real  Keeping it real  But you see a lot of these  Sports talk shows  And they're supposed to be  Talking to guys  But they're the ones  Apologizing a lot  A lot  ESPN  Oh my god  They lead the pack  As far as apologizing  So  Good for Charles Barkley  I hope he hangs in there  I hope he hangs in there  What do you think?  Yeah  You think he apologizes?  No  No  He's another one 
[00:33:00]  He's not completely untouchable  Like you know  Don Rickles  And shit like that  We were talking about yesterday  But he's  He's pretty  He's pretty far up there  As far as untouchable  Because people know  He's not gonna  You know  Right  He's not just gonna  Start apologizing for shit  Right  So  Let's see  I've got a fat story  For the guys  This guy says  I'm a fat fuck  And those fat groups  Make fat people look fat  I want to comment  On the big women  This guy's out of San Antonio 
[00:33:30]  Let's see  John Boy  Oh man  Hello  Good morning  Hey  We got three good things  Down here in San Antonio  We got our San Antonio Spurs  We got our Mexican food  And we got our BMWs  Our big Mexican women  Oh  Okay  This is  Hey  D's from South Texas  I feel like I'm at a comedy club here 
[00:34:00]  I know  I know  Now it's direct from Mexico  Right  I think that's really how he is though  Thanks John Boy  Bye  All right  Bye bye  Let's go to Josh in Connecticut  Josh  Hey  I'm 6'5  340 pounds  I used to weigh 420  And these groups are horrible  We're fat  You hate to have your picture taken  Stop making me acceptable  It's horrible  I can't get these groups 
[00:34:30]  That do this  Right  Fat people are disgusting  And I'm fat  Well  I don't think people should like have  You know  Point and make fun of someone's fatness  Obviously  But I don't think you should have a group  That's just gonna coddle all the fat people  Yeah  I don't think that's doing anyone any justice  I 100%  That doesn't help the people  And I can't believe you guys let Sam get by with saying  Louisville  Instead of Louisville  I didn't even catch that  I thought he was just being like ironic 
[00:35:00]  No he's just a moronic  I don't even  I don't think ironic  I don't even listen to what he says  Louisville  What are you  Reverend Al  In Louisville  Louis  Thanks gentlemen  I gotta get to work  Hey can we play that one  Montage again  The Reverend Al  Yes  I do like that  I watched it about 4 or 5 times  It's so funny man  Because people kept sending it to me  I'm like  Oh what the hell  I'll watch this again  Reverend Al just tripping up on so many words  He's terrible reading that teleprompter  This thing went everywhere too 
[00:35:30]  The show Barkley's on is untouchable  I think Kevin and Philly might be right about that  Hold on  Wow that was pretty cool  Let's go to Mike in Jersey  Mikey  What's going on guys  Good morning  Hey  I was watching  Just looking through Fox  Yesterday  The new awful show  It's called Fox Outnumbered  It's at noon  On Fox  It's three chicks and one dude  And they were going over this clip 
[00:36:00]  And you guys gotta fucking dial it up  It's hilarious  It's got this guy  Just put the tap pants  It's awful  You're really giving no good information  I guess they were trying to talk about the clip  I think he gave a lot of information  Yeah  They talked about it  And they were like basically saying  That Charles Barkley should apologize right  Oh  He was laughing  The whole crew was laughing  When the clip was going over  And the girls were trying to make him feel awful  About laughing  The one dude  Yeah can we find that 
[00:36:30]  Yeah  I'll fucking dial it up  Alright we'll dial it up  Thank you  Thanks Mike  You guys got some lingo  Dial it up  Dial it up  Let's say hi to Tony in Toronto  Tony what's up  Not much man  First of all  Those god damn people gotta stop  I'm a fat fuck  And I don't need them to tell me  I'm a fat fuck  You know right  I already know  I'm fucking lazy  That's the problem  I like to eat 
[00:37:00]  I'm lazy  See  There you go  I mean  I don't understand this  I don't understand it  These people gotta fucking stop  Charles Barkley  If he apologizes  I'll hang myself  Oh  Well we live in the world of the apology  So  So this is  This is gonna be interesting  To see if he actually apologizes  I hope not  I fucking hope not either man  Really  This is ridiculous  I mean  I honestly  If I was with you guys  I thought 10 days 
[00:37:30]  Without an apology  Would be easy  And I'm fucking sick of it  Well Adrian  What is his name  Adrian Broner  Will probably apologize soon  Cause he got suspended  Wait what did he say  Boxing  Oh right right  We're waiting for his apology  That'll probably happen  Cause they're fucking with his livelihood  All the shit boxers do  And they suspend the guy for doing it  Right  Ridiculous  Assholes  Right they're taking a chance  Every time they go into the ring  Yeah  Taking a chance at  You know 
[00:38:00]  Being concussed  Concussed  Or  You know  Detached retina  Yeah all that stuff  Brain injury  All sorts of brain injuries  Fat lips  Fat lips  Making them look less pretty  Right  Thank you Tony  Thank you  Hey Punchy  You heard me Palooka  How's Punty doing?  I'm worried about Punty  Little Punty  How is Punty?  How is Punty?  Is he adopted yet?  I don't know  Travis  Is Punty adopted yet? 
[00:38:30]  Of course we've named him Punty  I don't know  But last night  He's the kitten that got kicked  By the animal  Last night I wanted to  To see if there was an update  And I actually typed into Google  Punty  To hit  To go to Google  Silly  I don't think there's an update though  We need an update  Yeah  Someone's going to adopt Punty  Of course  And they're going to be in a world of hurt  Oh  Yeah  Alright  We've talked enough about fat people 
[00:39:00]  I think  Yeah  There's a lot of stories online though  Of what?  Just people saying they're fat?  Yeah  I'm a weight loss surgeon  I want to comment  Okay  So let's go to Hank in Boston  Hank  Hey guys  I just want to comment  First of all  On the things you guys are eating relatively  Jimmy  You sound like you're eating  The most healthy diet  Yes  Opie  Yes but I drink cum  That's dangerous  That's all protein  Just kidding  Right  That sounds through 
[00:39:30]  Anthony  You're killing yourself  Right  You need to have some protein  In your diet  First thing in the morning  Really  Protein is calories  But it's also fuel  For your essential body  I get home at 11 o'clock  And then I eat  Yeah it's still breakfast for us  By the time we're done  Breakfast  What?  You try to eat at  You try to eat at 5 in the morning  Yeah you try to eat at 5 in the morning  I do  I'm a surgeon  I'm up early every day  That's right sir  It's the most important meal of the day  The breakfast  Like I said before 
[00:40:00]  Try driving your car without fuel  I drink orange juice in the morning  You're just going  But you're just going through a thing  Anthony usually has breakfast  That might stimulate some rapid weight loss  In the short term  But in the long run  You're really doing yourself some harm  What harm?  Maybe I'm not as energetic  Do you understand how much he drinks  During the week  And you're worried about orange juice?  Unless there's not vodka in it 
[00:40:30]  That's all we are thinking around here  Maybe I should start doing that  A few screwdrivers in the morning  Can I also comment on the obese people  Who are calling in  And obesity in general?  Yes  There's a point in obesity  Where it becomes very very difficult  To lose weight  Through diet and exercise alone  The body resets its hormones  And those hormones affect how you sense hunger  And feeling full  And it's really 
[00:41:00]  It's almost impossible  Once you reach a critical body mass index  Which is a ratio of your height to your weight  Then you're just what?  Always hungry?  Yeah  So ignore it  Have some fucking self-control  You fat fuck  Yeah or eat something different  Like I see fat people in the store  Or in the restaurants  And I always look  And I kind of wish I didn't  And it's like  If I see a fat guy in the gym  I was in the gym  Eating a seal  If you see a fat guy in the gym  Everyone kind of respects a big fat guy in the gym 
[00:41:30]  Like if there's a guy 380  Everyone's like  Wow that guy's making an effort  He's trying to do something  But when you're in a restaurant  And you see somebody ordering  Just dog shit to eat  Everything you're saying might be right  But there's no way they can't say  I want some egg whites  Instead of I want eggs and bacon  And they're making a decision  To eat pancakes  It comes down to laziness  Because you know  Sure dry salad sucks  But there's a lot of other things  You can eat that taste good  And is healthy for you  But people just get completely lazy 
[00:42:00]  And go pancakes  Butter  Syrup  Thank you  Two orders of bacon  Extra crispy  They don't even think about  Like maybe in that particular restaurant  There might be  You know something that is healthier  Right  And tastes good  Because they want to eat it  Doctor  Doctor  Comment  Yes  Yes  I would say that  You know  There's been this sort of  Carbohydrates are bad  Phrase  That's  For a long time now  With the Atkins diet  And all that  It's turning out that 
[00:42:30]  Probably a lot of that  Is actually true  There's a lot of good  Data coming out now  That  Fats are actually  Not bad for you  They're not what causes  High cholesterol levels  They're not what causes  Heart disease  They're not what causes  Diabetes  It's really the carbs  That's not to say  You should cut out  All carbs from your diet  But  But  Opie  I mean  Bacon and eggs  Are probably  We're going to find out  In about two or three years  Not  Put it off  I don't know about that  We keep getting different reports 
[00:43:00]  On what's going to stop your heart  And what's  That's all right  You rock on the phone  Bacon is a great thing to have  All the time  And the stuff you squeeze into water  To make it taste good  I gotta go  Click  I don't know about that  Bacon grease  That's clogging up the arteries  Sir  Come on  My dad was down to one lousy artery  At the end of his life  And he ate shitty for most of his life  Did he smoke?  No  And he didn't really drink that much  Smoking's pretty bad  He had a horrendous diet  And had no problem eating very greasy shit  And his arteries were completely clogged 
[00:43:30]  He had quadruple bypass surgery  And then doctors said  You gotta start eating well now  You got a new start here  And he refused to  So it went back down to  Clogging up all the new arteries  So explain that one, sir  Well, to be honest  You know, I just kind of cut and sew  I'm not like a scientist  But I'm just telling you  What the recent data has  You're just a sawbones  Yeah  Yeah, I'm old-fashioned  Just a country doctor, Jim 
[00:44:00]  Right  I think your point  You know, having bacon every once in a while  Isn't gonna do that much damage  But, you know  If you're eating that type of stuff  Day after day after day  I mean, you know, the grease  And the  Okay, but that's true  But there are healthy fats, too  Like Jim mentioned  I know about healthy fats  A little guac  Yeah, sure, guac  I think that's a little rough  About the guac  Right  He made good  That Mexican food 
[00:44:30]  When it finally arrived  Was amazing  Dandy  From Stephen Starr's  New restaurant here  In Manhattan  Called Elves  Elves, I think  In Battery Park  Go there  It's amazing  The food was excellent  Yes  Guys, I gotta punch out  Thanks very much  Thank you  Thank God  Go stitch up a stomach  Right  Go tie it  Yeah  Tie a stomach  Make another fatty  Have a body like a bat  Let's go  Get wings  Yes  Get that skin removal 
[00:45:00]  I'm thinking of that surgery  That's it  That's all that  Skin removal  You're gonna get skin removal surgery  You said?  No  Oh, okay  I was like, what?  No, I'm thinking  I wasn't listening for a second  I hope I don't need that  That would be awful  We're gonna go to break  With Reverend Al  Fucking up a lot of words  This montage is great  And it's making the rounds  We'll be back  But resist  We much  We must  They're all jitty  About a shutdown  The Tortoise  In the race

No  I think we're gonna continue that  Who says that?  It bothers you that much  That you had to call the show really?  I haven't noticed  No it doesn't really bother me  But  Alright  Then  You know in this day and age  We shouldn't even take a call like that  How about age and day?  Age and day  Is this your last day really?

Oh good  Alright good  I learned a lot just listening to you guys and stuff 
[00:59:30]  Yeah?  Yeah  What did you learn?  What are a couple things that you learned?  A couple things that I learned  Yeah  Or you want  We should give her time  Maybe that's on the spot  Yeah  Yeah  Like come back in a little bit  And write something down  Yeah all the things you learned  This is  This is your pop quiz before we  From the morning  To like  Keep your stand  Like hold your opinion  Yeah  Right  That's what I got from you guys  Mostly  Whoa  Nice  Yeah that's true  And that's your last day  You can say  Who around here would you say 
[01:00:00]  Is not a great worker?  Not a great worker?  Yeah if you had to pick one person  Who's not a great worker  Out of everyone?  Yeah  I don't know  Everyone does different things  That's true  But if you had to pick one  Being your last day  If they had to say  Like by process of elimination  Someone is the worst worker here  Who would you guess?  Um  You're not going to  You're not going to offend them  Because they've already been told  Yeah I'm sure  Adrian  Oh the other  The other intern  They always throw each other 
[01:00:30]  On the run to the bus  I love it  Right  Well it's also  They can't get  They're not going to get any crap  From the other  Yeah that's true  So why is Adrian  It's your bad worker?  I don't know  Sorry  Um  I don't know why  Uh oh  Here he comes  Oh no  Battle of the  How's it going guys?  Hey  How you doing?  She says  She says you kind of suck  That's absurd  I don't feel like sugarcoating it  She's basically saying  You kind of suck  That out of everybody here  You're the worst worker  Really? 
[01:01:00]  But he's the one  With the sleep problem  So you got to give him  A little  Oh that's true  He fell asleep on the phone  On Wednesday  Taking a little Natsuki  Oh damn  I don't recall Natsuki at all  That's why we didn't have  A lot of drafts for Louis CK  Oh shit  Oh catching up on some slumber  Yeah all of a sudden  Last day she has a personality  Oh  Really because you ignored me  The whole time  Oh  And we really want to get into it  Yeah  Okay  Damn 
[01:01:30]  Um  Angelica doesn't like to do a lot of work  Actually you don't like to explain anything  You could talk to the staff too  I mean they'd probably tell you the same thing  I have been as courteous as possible  Um  That's not true  That's not true  No  It's not true  Why isn't it true  What did you do wrong  He's rude  How is he  Would you care for a blueberry  No thank you  That's cool  I'm just being courteous  How is he rude  He's just rude  He's just snarky to me  Glazes over me  Doesn't answer my questions  When I try to learn things  What's wrong with you 
[01:02:00]  Have I  Why wouldn't you teach her  I've taught  Why is he teaching her  Well he learned everything  I think like within the first two weeks  Right  And then they were like  Okay Adrian  Now you teach  The intern that came in two weeks after you  Oh my god  Really  Yeah  For example  There's Pro Tools  Which I taught you on your first day  Which he showed me one drop  And said tell Eric  I showed you  And like rushed me out of the producers  That's not a lie  That's very discourteous 
[01:02:30]  That's untrue  Actually  What really happened was  And I'm sure Stav will clarify this  That you came in  On a day when  They said alright  Go over Pro Tools with her again  And you sat there and texted  While I was showing you things to do  Oh shit  You weren't speaking to me  You like to text  And take pictures of the studio  Rather than do work  When I ask him questions  He ignores me  Whenever I ask him a question  He ignores me  Oh it's nothing  Just leave it alone  It's fine  You don't like pretty girls  What's wrong with you  What's that  I mean  I like pretty girls  Is he she's pretty?  No he talks to all the other interns  Really?  He does?  Yeah 
[01:03:00]  All the other ones  From the other shows  I don't talk to you  Because you don't like to work  Whoa  Who knew this was going on?  It's something that drives me nuts  Eric did I not bother you  I bothered everyone  About giving me more work  I bothered everybody  About keeping me busy  And everyone gave the work to Adrian  Oh shit  I will say this  If anything  Wait why is E-Rock nodding  You're nodding a lot  No because I did  I asked for more work  No she was right up  To the point where  She was saying  We were giving it all to Adrian  We did give her assignments to do  So it's not like 
[01:03:30]  She wasn't asking for anything  And it's not like  We didn't give her anything  If anything  She was asking  I mean she asked  More  She asked a ton  Of questions  About everything  In a good way  I mean  Supposed to  The most inquisitive intern  Like ever  Right  Right  So she wasn't  Ignoring things  I would agree with that  Yeah  Slacking  I don't agree  I don't agree that I ignored you  I would try to  Go over stuff with you  And you would just  And that was it  Wow  If I was in the middle  Of working on something  Then I would say  You know  I'm trying to work on this  I would never just  Flat out ignore you 
[01:04:00]  I would ask you why  Because you're the one  Who's supposed to help me  So if you're working on something  I have to ask  What are you doing  I didn't even hear what you said  She's saying  You ignore her  Right  Yeah  You should put headphones on  She's a professional  She has her headphones on  Right  She put them on quick too  Immediately  Yeah  She knows what she's doing  She sat right down  That's right  I got all new headphones to work here  I got all new USB to work here  And I  You bought headphones to work here?  Where are they?  In my bag  You got any headphones with you?  Yeah  Good for you 
[01:04:30]  She could plug in anywhere  Do you buy headphones, Adrian?  Yeah  They're the $10 little earbuds  Oh boy  But those are just great  No, I got new studio headphones  Half fast  You're just half fast, Adrian  Yeah  You're welcome  I don't know what happened  I don't know what I can do  Because you two don't like each other?  I never  I didn't think that  I didn't know you disliked me  I didn't dislike you  Well, not to her face  But you were obviously  Bad-mouthing her behind her back  And calling her lazy  Right  Yeah, I would say that  I mean, that's everyone  Wow  Whoa 
[01:05:00]  Well, Sammy Arock  Haven't said that  No, I don't know  Are they lazy, Sam?  No, I don't think either of the interns are lazy  Eric says no, too  So that means that it's a personal issue  I feel like, if anything  They would say Adrian works harder  Because they give him all of the work  You know?  Like, Adrian, do this  You gotta get these drops  You gotta do this  So  Do you think because you're a girl  They didn't give you as much work?  I don't know  Are you here next semester?  Mm-mm  Why not?  Because I got another internship  Where? 
[01:05:30]  Where you're at?  At a TV production company  Oh  That's ambitious  That's nice  We're right up through the medium  What about the headphones?  I guess they'll come in handy over there  You'll be able to plug in  Yeah  Right  All right  What about your, you know, personal life?  What do you do?  What do you like?  What do you do?  Will you go out?  Um, no  No  You what?  I have a boyfriend  Oh, yeah, well  And I stay  I like how that got right out  Look, I have a boyfriend  All right, so  Thank you to the interns

He works on the Staten Island Ferry  On the Staten Island Ferry?  My  I know  I knew him my whole life  Because my dad was a captain  My families are captains  Really?  And his dad works there  So, like, I knew him  Since I was little  Wow  Okay  I didn't know there was a whole thing going on  With the Staten Island Ferry and captains  And nepotism  Yeah  You keep it in the family, I guess, right?

Yeah, the Sully plane  Sully?  Oh, no  The Staten Island Ferry kind of  Yeah, that's too far  The Staten Island Ferry is too far down  Yeah  How many times have you taken the Staten Island Ferry?  Countless  I think I've taken it once  There's no number  Once or twice in my life 
[01:07:30]  Yeah  Yeah, it's just not a very fun ride  Why go over to Staten Island?  Yeah  There really isn't a need unless you live there  Exactly  I just took it and came back  How was it?  Not eventful  Exactly  Rather slow trip  Yes  Yeah  I just wanted to take a ferry ride  Not quite a cruise  What's it, about a half hour?  Like 20 minutes  Some people take it to see the Statue of Liberty  But if you want to take it  You can just take the Liberty boat to see it  Yeah  Why not go to the one that actually goes to the Statue of Liberty? 
[01:08:00]  Adrian, you have any captains in your family?  No  Oh  Yeah, what does your father do?  My father works in mortgages  Not exciting  Snooze fest  Not a captain  No way  A capitán  Nope  And what are your  What's your dream job?

Unless they could really fix you up good  They're just extending life and you're still fucking 
[01:09:00]  No, they're literally going to keep you fixed up good  Yeah?  Yes  Right  They're saying kids born now are going to make it to 100 no problem  Oh boy  That's pretty crazy  Do you have any friends you can introduce an older gentleman to?  Maybe friends that aren't as driven as you  They just don't have much going on  But they're attractive  Daddy issues  Yeah, maybe they're just, you know  Struggling with a drinking problem  They've seen older gentleman's guidance  Sorry  No, huh?  No  Nothing like that  No one has to hook me up with their friends  I don't know where they come from, Jim 
[01:09:30]  I know  It's amazing  It's funny girl who'll hook me up with her friends  She'll hook me up with some friends  Yeah  Well, that's great  So you're off and running tomorrow  Your last day  We probably should have done something for you  Yeah  I've been asking  What?  I've been asking now to talk to you guys  Yeah  That's true  For a long time  So, do you think that  We like Adrian  But do you think that he kind of like had a thing for you?  No?  Mm-mm  Was he rude to you from day one? 
[01:10:00]  And he just never stopped being rude?  What a mo  What's his deal?  I don't know  Why are you just rude to people?  Right  I mean  No, he's not rude to anyone else  Just you  Not even the other interns  You feel superior?  But he knows it  He just said he is  That has nothing to do with it  No, I'd never  Listen  I was never intentionally rude to her at all  Mm-hmm  Ever  The only time I was ever rude was when  I felt that I was being  She was rude to me at first  What happened?  You asked her out  She said no  No, that's not how it went 
[01:10:30]  How did it go down?  Usually, I would  You know  If one of us needed to cover the phones or anything like that  Say I was on the phones  I had to use the restroom  It would be  You know  Hey, could you just jump on the phones for me?  I just gotta run to the bathroom  But then it started to become  From that to just a text message that said  Phones  Or get on phones  You started that  And then  Oh shit  Anytime I text you  We could go through a text  I said  Hey, could you cover the phones?  Could you cover the phones?  You could look at the text messages too  Yeah, you started that texting  Yeah, but I'm saying  Instead of being courteous 
[01:11:00]  You know, being polite  It would be  Phones  Or you would just come and say  Because you were rude to me  Get on the phones  I would always ask him  If you wanted breakfast  When I would go on breakfast runs  And he would never ask me  See, that's just a flat out lie  Even when I got him  Even when I got him  Sweetheart  See, so  Here comes HR  That is rude  Wow  You are rude  Sweetheart  And then Eric said something  Then he started being a little nice  But I still, like, it was fake  So you're saying  It wasn't like a genuine courtesy  He was just being dismissive  Like, I'm gonna be out  You want something, toots?  Like, not being  Yeah, I don't think he was always so 
[01:11:30]  It was always so purposeful  But he was rude to me  Yeah  When's your last day, Adrian?  I'm coming back for the summer smithers  Jesus  Why?  Why?  Why is it good work?  Why?  Why can't I?  We just don't have a lot of girls around here  No, we don't  It sort of spices up the place a little bit  It gives a different attitude  Makes the place smell better  Right  Girls smell a lot better  Can you sit in this chair for a couple minutes?  I'm in a smelly chair today  They just, uh, you know 
[01:12:00]  I have perfume in my bag  Nice to have around  A brand of perfume  Um, I don't know which one  Just good smelling stuff  Paris Hilton?  Yeah, it's like an old one  Is it good?  Can we smell it?  Because we hate her  No, I'm serious  I want to smell it  To see if at least she has a good perfume  Can you get her back?  Because she's a good  Yeah, she's not very nice  Are you thinking good riddance, Adrian?  Absolutely  Good riddance  Good riddance  It's getting rid of someone 
[01:12:30]  Riddance  Who said good riddance?  Adrian said he was thinking good riddance  Which is unkind  Wow  And she said the first day  She listened to the Paris Hilton interview  And was laughing her ass off  I don't think we were that funny that day  He was funny because he was just so pissed off  She pointed at me  I want that for the record  Hold on a second  That's a lie  You stole her point  What?  She sounds like somebody who did a lot of homework  Yes  She bought headphones  She familiarized herself with the show 
[01:13:00]  Why would you say she doesn't do work?  You didn't really know us before the show?  I mean, I did know of you guys  Right  I just didn't really listen  E-Rock is carrying your bag into the studio  Oh, there he goes  He probably went through it  Yeah  Doing inappropriate things  Did you sniff her stuff?  No  Did you go through it for tamps?  That's what I always do  Whenever I'm going to date  To go to the bathroom  I rifle through for tamps  And if I see one  I fucking amstray on the bill 
[01:13:30]  And the date is short  Oh, there's a little perfume  That smells pretty good  Yeah, it smells very girly  Yeah, but she doesn't come up with that stuff  This smells like a 22-year-old girl  Oh, let me smell  It's got like this  Almost a sugary smell  But it's nice  It's better than I would have thought it would be  But doesn't that just smell like a girl  Bubble gum and homework  Yeah  It's in like a  That's a good one  It's like a pen that you spray  It's one of those portable ones  Very nice  I like it 
[01:14:00]  Very nice  Oh, that's very nice  Yeah  Thanks  Yeah  Yeah, this is a real creep magnet, I imagine  My boyfriend just got it from me  Did he really?  Because I ran out of it  The boyfriend should never buy shit like that  Because it makes you smell better to other people  I never buy women good perfume  No, you just throw shit at them  People run away  Yeah  Perfect  Or sardine oil  I'm like, it's an aprodisiac  And they rub it on their thighs and neck  Oh, yeah  She's got the headphones  Nice  Very nice headphones  Look at you, prepared  Yeah, look at that

Yeah  He's the rope guy  Is he better looking than Adrian?  Yes  Oh, Adrian  Damn, that's good  A little bit  Oof, wow  Adrian, you got a girlfriend?  No  Oh, shit 
[01:15:00]  That figures, right?  Big surprise, huh?  Did you find him charming, Adrian?  You didn't?  No  Well, these two never got along  Oh, this is great  I never knew  Right  It sounded like she made an effort  Neither did I, yeah  Yeah  It sounds like she made an effort  And Adrian just didn't want to fucking  Be bothered  Hold her shoulder and talk shit behind her back  Right, right  Called her lazy  Sal helped me the most  What?  Sal helped me the most  I bet he did  Because he wouldn't ask  Because he can relate to a woman  Yes, because he borrowed your perfume  Yes 
[01:15:30]  What did Sal do for you?  He answered all of my questions  I bought them with questions  He helped me  About womanhood  Oh, some questions  I want them answered immediately  Wow  That's great  Sal  Sal's very good with the intern  How does Iraq?  He's good  Uh-oh  He's always busy  What?  He's always busy  He's always busy  Doing fan fiction  Or looking for bikini girls  On his computer  Exactly  Trying to re-yellowing his Hulk shirt  He's trying to  Re-yellow  Redoing his hero list 
[01:16:00]  On a daily basis  Right, right  That list changes drastically  By the hour  Searching for public cakes  Cakes in public places  Iraq does a great job  Of looking busy  He does, doesn't he?  Iraq, how do you feel  With Fox in front  Giving you all that attention?  Man  Very nice  Mentioning you by name  And everything this morning  I know  Three days  They have nothing to talk about  Damn  Very nice to get that kind of  It was a great moment  It was one of the best moments  Of the week for those guys  Yep 
[01:16:30]  And it'll replay throughout the weekend  Big moment  Yeah, and they give the shout to Iraq  Mm-hmm  How is Sam?  Sam?  Was he nice to you?  Always  Okay  People want to know if you're hot  I would say yes  She's very shocked  I would say yes  It's one reason we don't talk to her much  If that's okay  Are we allowed to do that?  Are we allowed to say you're hot?  Okay, good  You could tell if a girl intern  Isn't very attractive  Because then we're like  We talk to her more  Yeah  We clam up around  The attractive ones  We're careful with  Right  We don't want to say the wrong thing  Because we're stupid 
[01:17:00]  Very careful  Yeah, we'll probably say something  Really stupid and inappropriate  And get fired  Yeah, you never know  You're going to step in the wrong  Human resources trap  Yeah  You claim she was attractive  My boyfriend was a fan of yours  And I didn't even  Oh, she pointed at me again  Oh, really?  No, she didn't  For a record  She certainly did not point at me  We really wanted to go to your show  Oh, good  Oh  Did you like Jim Norton's show?  Did you like Jim Norton's show?  We were cracking up the whole time  Oh, good  Yeah, it was actually a really good night  There was a Sunday night show 
[01:17:30]  That was one of my favorite ones  I expected it to be funny  And it was so funny  Like  Wow  I thought it would be  Oh, thank you  It was really, really great  Thank you  Yeah, I was happy with that, Seth  That was a really nice crowd  No compliments from Adrian about anything  Well, he didn't even do extracurricular  She's doing all this extracurricular show stuff  On the weekends  Right  She went to the Jim Ross show  When Jim Ross came in here to promote it  Wow  She was there  A little homework  And she wasn't like  Oh, can I get free tickets?  It was like  We found out after  You know what I mean?  She's got money 
[01:18:00]  No, I mean  I think she's got some money  Got a little family bankroll  By the way  My brother likes him  Huh?  Oh  He used to love wrestling  Right  Because he was little  Yeah, little kids like wrestling  He was 13, now he's 16  Oh, so he's not as into wrestling anymore  A little bit  A little bit  Sam  It's entertainment for all ages  Oh, boy  Sam was posting pictures just yesterday  Oh, yeah  Sam's still in the mind of a 13-year-old  I was wrestling dolls  They weren't  No, it was dolls 
[01:18:30]  Dolls  That's a whole other topic  But that's the wrong  Is that your only sibling?  I have an older brother, too  Oh, okay  Oh, they beat you up at all  No, they were good?  Yeah  Wow, even younger  Because we kind of hassled my little sister  For a few years  That's the new word for it  Hassle  Yeah  Get along  Nice, tight, close family  That's good  Adrian, why didn't you go to any gym shows?  It was on the Thursdays  I've been to two gym shows, actually 
[01:19:00]  What would you say your ethnic background is?  My dad's German  My mom's side's Peruvian  Wow, German and Peruvian  Peruvian  That means that's an ex-Nazi  That went over to South America  After World War II  Wow  And, you know  Yeah, hooked up  Alright  That's good  How long have they been boat captains?  Well, my dad passed away two years ago  Oh, I'm sorry  He worked on boats his whole life  My grandpa was director of operations 
[01:19:30]  The ferry  So he was there for a long time  After he came out of the Navy  Sell the seven seas?  Something like that  My brother  My older brother works on the tugs  Tugboats  And my two uncles are captains on the ferry  Your family loves the water  Yeah, I worked on a fishing boat last summer  You did?  Yeah  And I'm going to work on the water taxi this summer  Isn't that a hard work on a fishing boat?  No, it's fun  Uh-oh  She's saying  You didn't work hard  Hard work is fun  You didn't work hard 
[01:20:00]  Do you get seasick?  Yeah, I'm the only one in my family who gets seasick  Oh, man  What a shitty profession if you get seasick  Right?  The whole family is boat obsessed  You're just puking  Awful  I was really embarrassed  My grandpa was like  He's very like this  Like Navy-ish  And he's like  Just eat some saltine crackers  That's what we  That's what they always say  Yeah  I'm like  Just makes you sicker  No, saltines are okay, though  It kind of mellows your stomach a little bit  It sits in your stomach  It keeps all those acids from flying around  Vomiting will keep that girlish figure  So you keep right on ahead 
[01:20:30]  Absolutely  Barf all you want  I encourage every girl I go on a date with  As soon as we're done eating  I'm like  I'll wait while you go to the bathroom  I usually give them the old punch in the stomach  Right there at the table  Let loose  I don't care  You don't need to  Just say  We're going to go home and have sex  That will start to vomit  That's so mean  I love Jimmy  So you get seasick  Okay 
[01:21:00]  Yeah  Wow  Quite the exciting little adventurous family  Pretty cool  You ever work in mortgages, Adrian?  No  Ever go to work with Dad?  When I was a kid  Father-son work day  Oh boy  Wouldn't you just curl up on the couch and go to sleep?  Would all the kids sit on the couch eagerly  As they talked about home equity loans?  Yeah  Some points  Yeah, he does a lot of different things  I know he doesn't like doing mortgages  But  Oh wow, then he's cool 
[01:21:30]  Yeah  What else does he do?  Well, he's had a ton of different jobs  He used to be an assistant director for the biggest state park in Jersey  Wow  He was into environmental science, conservation, all that stuff  And then owned a shipping company for a little bit  That he was trying to manage  And then moved into mortgages just to kind of support the family  What happened to his shipping business?  He went bankrupt  What was he shipping?  I'm not really sure  Just anything  Yeah  I don't really know 
[01:22:00]  Didn't work out, huh?  Yeah  This was in the  Russian hookers  It was in the 80s  The whole container of them died  In the wire  It was in the 80s in Hudson County, in Jersey  So, I always get that question  What was he shipping?  Sounds connected  He's  My dad's a Cuban immigrant, actually  Oh  Yeah  So, the Cuban mafia?  What's up?  Not that I know of  No  More in Miami, I would say so  Yeah  Yeah  Hmm  All right  Wow  We've certainly learned a lot today 
[01:22:30]  Yeah  One quick little sit down with the interns  And realizing  Yeah  Fucking can't stand each other  Why don't you think she does work?  Because she doesn't  I mean  If you want to look at the  I see her walking around doing things  Yeah  I mean  That's walking  I see her hands full of stuff  Point A to point B  Kind of stuff  Yeah  I mean  Food runs, yeah  She had a fine internship  Do you think because she's a hot girl  She doesn't think she has to work as hard?  That's not that she's a hot girl 
[01:23:00]  But that's just my age in general  Oh  What did that mean?  That was a backhanded insult  I definitely think he does more work  But that's because they give him more work  Uh-huh  And you asked for more work  So you can't blame you  Not for lack of trying  Right  Do you think because you're a girl  They gave you less work  Like instinctively  They just think a man will do it better?  No  I just think that they got used to Adrian  So they just started giving him the work  Oh  They just  It's like  You know  It's just like anything  Like  It's like a skin tag  Right  Adrian's a skin tag  He's just there  Well he's there 
[01:23:30]  He's here all the time  Ah  Shit  Because I have school Tuesdays and Thursdays  Last semester  My old internship  I had school on the weekend  So I was at the production company  Five days a week  And they loved me more  Because I was there all the time  Yeah  And he's here all the time  So everyone loves him  Oh  Okay  So I get it  We don't love him very much  We don't  He's got a stick  Really strong word  Yeah  That's how I feel  It's not that  No we don't love him  He's a nice guy  I like him  Yeah  But  Will you remember him 
[01:24:00]  Like two days after he leaves  Who  Precisely  You know people  Come up to your shows  And say dude  I interned for you guys  And I usually  Will take a second  I'll remember him  But like I would never  Have known them on  No I know  It's just like  I don't know  I guess because most times  They're walking  And we're sitting here  Facing each other  And they're leaning  Like they're putting something here  Or they're getting  But you're not looking at them  No because they're just unimportant  Well I didn't want to say that  But I don't know if that's it  Well Angelica  We're happy you  Yeah man  I'm glad you had a good time  And good luck in the future 
[01:24:30]  I want a picture with everyone  Okay  Oh yeah  We don't do that  Indeed  Well that will happen  Because like  I know like  You're going to forget me next week  Because I haven't been around  You get interns all the time  But like  I had a really nice experience  Yeah  I love you guys  That's nice  Thank you  Soak up everything  We won't forget you  Don't worry about that  You will remember  You're one of three female interns  We've had in ten years  Right  Come back and see us  We'll remember  They never  I see Nikki all the time  Uh huh  From last time  Yeah 
[01:25:00]  She's with  Talent now  She's kind of working here now  Yeah  A little curly  A little curly top  Oh that was just another internship  Yeah  Boy  Enough with this place  Leave  They've got to start paying  Some of these people  All right  All right  We should take a break  All right  Thank you very much  Yes  Yeah  All right  I'd like that very much  And uh  Adrian  Frank  You're welcome  Adrian  Whatever his name is  You as well  My pleasure  Yes  Good job  All right  We'll be back  Thanks for talking  Opie and Anthony 
[01:25:30]  Have been creating  Broadcasting magic  For 20 years  With Doug from the O&A vaults  This is a 20th anniversary  O&A radio gem  And then I went into that bathroom  Yeah  Jimmy  What the  That's not one dump  Yeah it is  Jim  There is so much shit in there  Yeah  It's filling up  It's like  It's like a big pot full of meat  Just say it  Big boy made a duty  This thing is above the water line  It's mighty like a glacier 
[01:26:00]  It's above the water line  It is  You can't see how much is below it  It's like an iceberg  It's raising towards the heavens  In a statement  And the statement is  Big boy made a duty  Can we put a party hat on it  Or something  Oh dude  I'd love to  Hey can we do like  Mr. Potato Head  Mr. Shithead  Yeah let's do Mr. Shithead  Could the interns  Maybe make little like things  Like eyes and stuff  Get in there  Breathe it in  Enjoy it  Be a part of it  True  How much for someone  To pick it up in their hand  What we need done is 
[01:26:30]  Your hand  Would have to go  Underneath  The duty  In the toilet  Pick up  Pick up as much as you can  In your hand  You don't have to close your hand  You just gotta kind of  Scoop it up straight out of the toilet  A loose little holding of it  And then go  Big boy short did make a duty  Short did  And then when you drop it  You have to say  Buh-bye  And then drop it back into the bowl  You uh  I think I'm gonna pass on this  200 bucks  But I mean a little hat  Three hundred dollars  Here's my hundred 
[01:27:00]  To talk to the duty  Let me see how you look  With the duty hat on  Put the duty hat on first  Alright  Look at him and his duty hat  Wait the duty hat has to be bigger  Alright the duty hat has to be bigger  Can you make a duty hat a little bigger?  And you gotta like get  We gotta like pin it down  We gotta pin  Big duty hat  Yeah  I like  Oh that's not a bad duty hat  Which one?  I prefer the white duty hat  I like that  I like the big duty hat  That big newspaper one  Is just silly 
[01:27:30]  I like it though  The big duty  And it says big duty on it  Now you do understand  The hand  Has to go  I would say  From the front of the bowl  You have to scoop under  To the back  And your knuckles  Must slide along the porcelain  You're trying to  So you're getting underneath  You're going for a classic scoop  You're not going in the middle  You're not cutting the middle  You're going  Like a steam shovel  You're getting underneath this thing  When you feel the heaviness of the duty  Then you lift up  Then you lift  And you present to the camera 
[01:28:00]  Keeping it above the toilet at all times  But out of the water  Alright let's  And above the rim  And then you talk to  You address the duty  Duty hat Jared has to come out of nowhere  He's just gotta come out of nowhere  And walk into the bathroom  And then Sam follows him in  Wait a minute  How about his first line  It'd be  He runs out of the office  And says  Did someone say  Big boy made a doody  Okay  I like that  Alright ready  Hold on  Good ant  Ready  Action 
[01:28:30]  Hey Jimmy  What happened in there  Big boy made a doody  Did someone say  Big boy made a doody  No  Big boy sure did make a doody  Bye bye  Bye bye  Give him his $20 
[01:29:00]  Oh shit  Oh my god  Oh my god  Oh my god  Oh my god  Oh end scene  Wow  That's a wrap people  Bravo  Jared  Oh my god  After 20 years  You would want to break too 
[01:29:30]  But the guys are back now  Enjoy  It's the Opie and Anthony show  On Sirius XM  Yeah  Oh Zeppelin  Nice  Good choice by the way  We gotta wait for the drums  Come on  Come on  Yeah  What a great little run that is  That drummer hasn't really done much  No  After Zeppelin  Oh 
[01:30:00]  Through your tears  Clarissa looks pretty good on these new commercials  Look at that shit  Right  Am I right  Yes  Clarissa explains it all  Clarissa  She lost some weight  And she looks pretty good  She's eight  Yeah  Nice big fucking tits  Explain that  Clarissa  Who is she?  She was on the Nickelodeon show 
[01:30:30]  Clarissa explains it all  She was in Sabrina the Teenage Witch  I don't know all that  Sabrina the Teenage Tits  Oh yeah  Yeah  I want to see where that small wonder girl is though  Yeah  She's fucking  Ugh  Small wonder  I love that show  Yeah  Robert Plant's in the news  And he's being an asshole  Wow  Maybe not though  Yeah  He doesn't need the money  Is he getting a big head?  Get it?  He's got a giant fucking  Figuratively  Literally 
[01:31:00]  I gotta find that picture and tweet us  Mm-hmm  You know all that stuff used to be up in my house  Oh yeah  Oh that's her  Now in boxes  That's the small wonder girl?  Yeah  She's alright  She kind of looks like Topanga a little bit  Her hair's a little too much but  Yeah she needs some conditioner  Mm-hmm  She's a little weird looking but  She looks like Lord  She looks a little like Lord  They cleaned her up nice for one video  For one video  I don't know how they did that  Yeah 
[01:31:30]  Someone should win an award  Robert Plant has decided that he's not gonna, you know, tour  And he says that he's not  I'm not part of a jukebox  A jukebox  Boy, people sure get the, a different impression of the band you're in  Than the way people look at the band  Right  Because I don't think anyone ever looks at Zeppelin like a jukebox  It's like, if you wanted to see Zeppelin  Um, you would just think this is amazing  I think I, I think I gotta respect him though  I'm a huge Zeppelin fan 
[01:32:00]  But he, he's done it  Yeah  And there's a lot of money he's leaving on the table  And he don't give a fuck  He did it  And he's moved on  And he's, he's never stopped performing  He's just moved on to other types of music  And, and he's been very successful with that  That's another thing fans don't realize  That was one little facet of his career  And, uh, you know  To him, that was just  Right  That was my old band  Right  They said that if Zeppelin had agreed to do the two-year reunion tour  That they had proposed after that O2 show 
[01:32:30]  Right  They would have been the first band to clear a billion in a tour  Wow  One billion  I guarantee you can't hit those notes  No, you can't hit those notes  He probably does not want to have to sing those songs every night  For two years  For two years singing  And probably tuned way down  So it doesn't even sound like the songs anymore  Yeah, they were all high  I think it would sound amazing, though  Whatever they did  Backup singers  I would see them, but it's just going to be a much different experience  Like Frankie Valli  Who you think you are, Frankie Valli?  Some big shots?  But McCartney still sounds good 
[01:33:00]  Like, he doesn't sound exactly like the records  But he still sounds really good  Very close to what he sounded like when he was a kid  It's amazing  Travis, you didn't read these other quotes  Wow  Does he drop end bombs?  It's been nearly seven years since the show at the O2  What?  The O2 Arena  Yeah, that was their reunion show  That was the arena  But it's been nearly seven years  Yeah  Since O2  Yeah  Since the O2 Arena show  The Arena is called the O2  Oh, I'm sorry, okay  Who's on first?  I'm sorry, okay 
[01:33:30]  O2  Well, what did O do?  O2?  O as well?  That doesn't work at all  The topic of Zeppelin's aboard tour still rankles Plant  Who has come to a pub near his North London home  To talk about the group's new series of archival releases  As explains his decision to not tour with Zeppelin  He leans forward with Menace  And his eyes nearly double in size  Wow  They fit his head now, finally  Yeah  Dinner plates  He doesn't seem like a nice guy 
[01:34:00]  We kind of  Yeah  We were lucky to be in that room that one day  Bobby Blant  It was the band  And me and Jimmy  Basically  They're warming up  Literally four feet from us  Five feet from us  I'll never forget  It was amazing  But he didn't even want to acknowledge we were in the room  We were five feet from his dick, basically  Because we were sitting down  It was kind of awkward for everyone  That's when Elo  Remember that when the guys took care of us  And Elo just said  Yeah, go in there  Just sit and watch  How well we get treated by him  Oh, my God  And growing up as a Zeppelin fan  I'm sitting in a room  As they're just practicing 
[01:34:30]  What was it?  They were doing like a town hall  Whatever it was called  Yeah, like Art is Confidential thing  Yeah, one of those  And he was with his new band  New music and all that  And I liked it  The Mighty Rearranger was the record  Yeah  I love that record  I think it's fantastic  And he had a lot of old school studio musicians  That really knew how to play  And he was doing his thing  And it was  I don't think  It was me and you  And that was it  That was it  I believe that's true  And then he had the Honey Drippers years ago  He was great with that  You know, that was 
[01:35:00]  That had some hits  I'm in the mood for a melody  I'm in the mood for a melody  I'm in the mood for a melody  I'm in the mood for a melody  I'm in the mood for a melody  I don't know that one  Maybe he did Sea of Love very well  Right  Do you remember  Yeah  He's been very successful  Yes, he has been  Not the same numbers, obviously  But good enough for him  And then he won something with that  Alison Krauss 
[01:35:30]  There's a lot of stuff  Alison  Huh?  Yeah  Oh, here's I'm in the mood  Yeah, play that  You know this one, right, Jimmy?  I think  Let it kick in  Groovy  Is this karaoke?  What year is this?  This is like 84  You've never heard this, Jimmy?  85  I might  I didn't know, remember  I always had a tough time 
[01:36:00]  Keeping up  Yeah, he went right for Zeppelin  And just continued  Very successfully  Zeppelin made it to what?  80?  Is that when Bonham died?  Was it?  Around there?  Was that the final?  Yeah, 19  That's what broke the beat up  Was his death?  Yeah, they said they weren't going to play without him  Wow  And then he maybe took about a year 
[01:36:30]  And then he reinvented himself  And had a bunch of hits right in a row  Unlike the Who  Who was fucking auditioning drummers at the funeral  His Now and Zen album was great  All right  I wasn't a big fan of this stuff  I mean, it was there, you know  Not a big fan  You kind of respect him, though  Like, he went mellow  He did  He could have found some players  To really keep that sound going 
[01:37:00]  Or something similar  That's what we need  Although Now and Zen definitely rocked out  Yeah  Yeah  It's nice to hear them not stealing riffs  Oh  Little songs that you want to sing  Little songs  I can't keep up with it  This is nice  I'm enjoying this  It was a big hit, too  Got a lot of play  I'm always amazed at pretty girls  And, like, videos from 30 years ago  You're like, god damn  She's in her 60s now  Oh, god  That's true  So, anyway 
[01:37:30]  The guy asks about Zeppelin  They're in this pub  And, uh  Robert Plank goes  You're going back to that same old shit  Wow  He says  A tour would have been an absolute  Menagerie of vested interests  And the very essence of everything  That's shitty about  About big-time stadium rock  We were surrounded by a circus of people  That would have had our souls on the fire  I'm not part of a jukebox 
[01:38:00]  Wow  Wait a minute  Wasn't he promoting a Zeppelin thing?  Huh?  Wasn't he promoting a release of something?  Yeah, just some archival things  Okay, well then why is he mad  If they're asking about Zeppelin  When he's promoting somebody with Zeppelin  If it's so fucking old news  Why are you promoting this, dummy?  I guess it's the whole  Getting back together thing  That he's probably answered a million times  Oh, okay  I'm guessing, I don't know  You're probably right  Right  He sees the vultures circling  Over the prospect of getting the band out there  Right  And he doesn't give a fuck 
[01:38:30]  And he knows they're not going to sound as good as they used to  So why not leave it where it was?  I don't blame him  Nearly all of Plank's peers are happy to deal with such a circus  Because considering the insane financial rewards  Good luck to them  He sneers  Because the rest of the guys are like  Sneered?  That are, you know, involved with Zeppelin  They're like, yeah, let's do this  No shit  He goes, I hope they're having a real riveting and wonderful late middle age  Somehow I don't think they are  Wow  Needless to say, Jimmy Page has a very different take on the situation 
[01:39:00]  There's bound to be fallout if you just do one show  He says, at the time of the O2 show  We were led to believe there were going to be more  You'll have to ask Robert why he changed his mind  I don't even know if he considered it  I don't know what he thinks  Wow  A little tension there?  Let's see  Plant  All right  When Robert Plant walked away from the group after the O2 show  Page, John Paul Jones, and Jason Bonham 
[01:39:30]  Continued to rehearse together in England  Even auditioning singers for a possible plant-free tour  Most names have remained secret  But Stephen Tyler and Alter Bridge frontman Miles Kennedy  Miles Kennedy is great  Is he that old, Miles Kennedy?  Why did I think he was younger?  Frontman Miles Kennedy have both admitted to spending a few days playing with the group  Stephen Tyler, stop  He'd Stephen Tyler up all the fucking Zeppelin songs  Gives a shit  Wait, how would that sound?  I know, exactly  He kind of took from Zeppelin a little bit for his own band 
[01:40:00]  David Coverdale  Yeah, but he's too fucking old now  Jesus Christ  He was old in the 80s  David Coverdale was just about holding it together in the 80s  But he was old then  He was an old guy  Older  Yeah  I think as the other guys in his genre at the time were in their 20s  He was in his early 30s  He was in his 30s  I think he probably had close to 10 years on the rest of the guys  Yeah  That were coming up with him  Miles Kennedy could sing his balls off though 
[01:40:30]  He's great, man  Do you know how many people can probably fucking just blast out Zeppelin that are just on YouTube?  Grab one of those motherfuckers  Right  It doesn't have to be a big fucking name  Go to the Philippines  Right, Philippines  Grab one of those guys  Grab a Samoan  Just put a sausage in his fucking pants and he'll be good  In his velvet pants  Right  Hans  Hans wants in on this  Hans  Hans  Hello  Hey Hans  Hello Hans 
[01:41:00]  Hey, you guys remember the song Big Log?  I do  Hans  Boobie  Of course we remember Big Log  Another song I liked  Hey, does Brothers Joe like the guitar playing in that song?  Because I'm a big guitar player fan  He loves it  In Big Log?  I don't know  Yeah, I love the guitar  I don't know if I've heard this song in the last five, six years easily  Oh, this one  Yeah, of course  Thank you, sir  Thank you, Bill Clay  All right  Bill Clay 
[01:41:30]  Get it  No  See, another one where it kind of just slows it down  Yes  Take it down a notch  Oh, this is the video where his car's overheating  What an 80s video this is  Where they have a little story around their song  It's either an 80s thing or a Cialis commercial  Or is it the Viagra one  Where his car's overheating  And he realizes he put water in  And it makes him a man  Even though he can't get a rod  Oh, is that what he's driving in the front of his car is limped  Yeah  He steps on the gas, but it's soft 
[01:42:00]  Nothing happens  Yeah  And his wife's behind him  Fucking a black Cadillac  His gear shift handles flopped over on the console  He's just jerking it, trying to get it back  Yeah  His wife's tweedling his nipples through the window  Nothing's happening  Look at the fucking guy  Pants are pulled up way too high  I hate that flannel, like, cut off  You don't like that, huh?  No, it's horrendous  He has a giant skull 
[01:42:30]  He has a huge head  Kind of a homoerotic walk  Desert gas station  You like this video, Sam?  Yeah, I hate storylines on a fucking video  Now he's looking at a...  A pinwheel  Oh, now he's gonna fantasize about something  What is this?  The pinwheel turns into a tire  Just a man on the open road 
[01:43:00]  That's right  It's a good song, huh?  There he goes  My life is a mile  We could keep going with this  But anyway, so there's more quotes  So they practiced without plans  So that probably pissed them off  He's one of those guys going, really?  Zeppelin without me, go fuck you  Why did they do that, though, when he left?  Because they realized that  Well, they don't have as much going on as Robert Plant  And they see the dollars 
[01:43:30]  Yeah  The dollars that they're leaving behind  I wonder who else  Why would they keep it secret  Who else they auditioned?  I don't know  People ask me nearly every day  About a possible reunion  Jimmy Page says with a sigh  The answer is no  It's been almost seven years since the 02  There's always a possibility  That they can exhume me  And put me on stage in a coffin  And play a tape  That said, Plant refuses to make  Sherman-esque statement forever  Ruling out the possibility of him 
[01:44:00]  Fronting Zeppelin again  I don't think there's any reason for me  To do that, he says  Otherwise, we've got nothing to be mystic about  When's it going to happen?  You're 65  Everything will develop as it develops  All doors are open  All phone lines are open  I don't hear from anybody  Talk is cheap  But I just think everything has to be new  Then you can incorporate history  What?  I don't know  Does that mean he's open to the idea  Of recording new songs with Zeppelin  Oh, God  That would sound awful  It's a new song 
[01:44:30]  I don't know if you really want new songs  Just toy your hits  Just toy your hits  And fucking watch the money roll in  Yeah  We haven't gotten soft  We're still made of lead  Oh, no  You don't like that?  That's so bad  I don't like that  Why?  It sounds like Van Halen wrote it  Let's see  In the lyric book  Would it be spelled L-E-D?  Yeah  Oh  Yeah  We haven't gotten soft  We're still made of lead  But lead is one of the softest metals  They wouldn't incorporate that though 
[01:45:00]  In the song  You know?  Well, how about  They rhyme lead with  Like not caring what somebody said  Or we can say  We always lead  We're never lead  Oh  Oh  It's so douchey  I'm so embarrassed  You don't like the lead being put in  I hate when you write songs  For bands that are getting back together  Why?  Because they're very embarrassing  We've been gone for a long  Long, long, long time  Ha ha ha 
[01:45:30]  Yes  The Van Halen one  Of course  We're back  Ha  Yeah  Woo  We've been away for a long, long, long, long time  We've been doing changes  We've played some games  The more things change  The more things stay the same  Stay the same  We're a little bit older  But we ain't much wiser 
[01:46:00]  We're back  Did you like  We're a little bit older  But we ain't much wiser  I love it  They should have actually recorded this one  Yeah  We're back  We're back  More on Robert Plant  We're just about done  Does that mean he's over to the idea  Of recording new songs with Zeppelin?  You can't be the marriage guidance clinic here  He says  Clearly irritated by this line of questioning  Strangely  He's among the few people 
[01:46:30]  Who felt it was a good idea  For Zeppelin to carry on without him  So Plant was like  Yeah, go, man  He says  They kept rehearsing after 2002  And they had a singer  Plant says  I don't know what happened  It seemed like a great idea to me  Oh, after  This is how dumb I am  That's why I said Miles Kennedy  I thought you were saying  In 1980 they did that  Oh, God, no  No, they went away for a long fucking time  So in 2002  It was just going to be  What, fucking  John Paul Jones  And Jimmy Page  Touring with the singer  And I guess Jason Bonham  And Jason Bonham  Who's obviously  Son Zeppelin 
[01:47:00]  No, you kind of need Robert Plant there  But he thought it was a good idea  And then Plant stands up to leave  But turns on his heel  Do you know why the Eagles said  They reunited when hell freezes over?  See, this article is written horribly  Uh-oh  And I'm trying to fix it on the fly here  It says  Plant stands up to leave  But turns on his heel  Do you know why the Eagles said  They'd reunite when hell freezes over?  Okay  But they did it anyway  And keep touring?  He asks  It's not because they were paid a fortune 
[01:47:30]  It's not about the money  It's because they were bored  And I'm not bored  Ah  So the Eagles said that  They were bored  And that was one of the main reasons  They got back together  Well, maybe he knows him  I think he's just saying that  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  I've got plenty to do  He's so busy, Robert  I'm so busy  But he is  I'm perming my hair  I've got lots of things to do  And he's still creating new music  But I have to brush my hair  And it takes six hours  Because I've got to big heads 
[01:48:00]  His curly locks  Yes, I'm curling my hair  And so I am  I bet he's a grump  Who's that?  Who's he look like?  Who's the girl?  He looks like the little girl  With the curly hair  Curly Sue?  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking of  Curly Sue  Curly Sue  I've got hair like Curly Sue  They were bored  I'm not  I'm doing Raggedy Andy on Broadway  I've got to dye my hair  Andy in Florida  Hey, back in 95 
[01:48:30]  There was an album  That Jimmy Page and Robert Plant did  It was called No Quarter  Oh, I remember that thing  Yeah, it was really good  It got all these  Can you find that, Sam?  It was done with like  Middle Eastern musicians  Or it had a Middle Eastern feel to it  Or whatever  And they toured behind that  I saw them in Orlando  And it was just a huge production  They had a full orchestra  They had all these Middle Eastern musicians  Sitting on rugs and shit like this 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, what was the name of the album again?  No Quarter  They really  No  Yeah, it was No Quarter  I remember that album  You sure?  I remember that  We used to goof on that  Oh, god damn  We did that at AF  Yeah  You did the whole  I forgot about that  It's one of our old bits  Yeah  All those guys are on the  Do Not Fly list  At this point, I'm sure  Oh, what?  Wasn't it  Didn't that bit go so I'm like  If the sun 
[01:49:30]  Refuse  To shine  Yeah, there was a  Yeah, we did that bit  Oh, and this guy just  Babbles  The full name of the album  Yeah  Was No Quarter  Jimmy Page and Robert Plant  Unleaded  Nice, right?  Oh, they're unleaded  That's not lead  D-D-E-D  I've got bored  I've got plenty to do  What was the big song off that  That radio was playing?  There was a good version of Cashmere 
[01:50:00]  That they did with the orchestra  All right  Cashmere?  Cashmere  I would want to hear Cashmere  Yeah, let's play a little Cashmere  From that album  We got that in the system?  Put it on  It was Cashmere, Georgie  Cashmere  You got it, Travis?  Yeah, this  I'm warning you  This is 12 minutes  So I don't know  All right  I think this was the version  That P. Diddy sampled 
[01:50:30]  Oh  That son of a bitch  Was he wearing a tux?  Did he?  At the time?  Yeah  Nice  You look cool  This is crazy  You don't like this?  Nah, this song I like  No, I mean this version  Oh boy, no 
[01:51:00]  What is that music?  No  This is  Seven  Shut up  You don't like this?  It stinks  Really?  It's horrid  What year is this? 
[01:51:30]  95  All right  Now it sounds cool  We're still hitting notes at 95  In 95  This is not the Giseflin song  This song fucking kicks ass  It's okay  See, but they didn't fuck with this one too much  I remember all the songs on this album  They really fucked it 
[01:52:00]  Yeah  Well, that beginning was like  He can't hit the notes though  That's why he won't tour them  Yeah  What a great riff  Yeah, whoever came up with this  Should be respected  Sing some black guy  Of course it was  A bunch of fucking smelly people 
[01:52:30]  Sitting on a carpet  Playing fucking sticks with strings  Wound around them  We know how this one ends  So we can move on  There you go  That's the latest on Robert Plant  Good shit  Same old shit  Fuck  Yeah  He doesn't need them  I guess in the end  No, he's like  He's that busy  And the reason why  He wanted them to go on  Without him  Is because he would have  Got a nice taste of that money 
[01:53:00]  He could just sit back  Sit back and just get a taste of that  Yes  So he don't give a fuck  Right?  Yeah  I don't think  I don't think  As many people  Would go to see it  You get Robert Plant up there  It's going to be  Fucking Zeppelin  Right  You don't have Robert Plant  Eh, it's a Zeppelin cover pant  Remember when the taco guy came in  How could I forget?  Steven Starr  Well, he didn't come in  With the tacos officially  No  His people came in  Came in with the tacos  The next day  Yeah  He came in with the guac 
[01:53:30]  And the chips  And salsa  Right  So the boys made a little bit  About the tacos  On the next very special  Opie and Anthony  The show celebrates  Taco Day  Uh, you got food for us?  Yeah, we have an  Entrepreneur restaurant tour  Opie and Anthony  Are promised a Mexican cornucopia  Rich enough to satisfy  The multi-millionaires  We have some  Mexican fare doing?  We do  But things turn ugly  When appetizers  Become the main course 
[01:54:00]  What do you bring in today?  Uh, we opened a new restaurant  Here in New York  So we brought some food in  Uh, I guess it's guacamole  But no explanation  No matter how difficult  To understand  Will suffice  When all that's on the table  Are chips and dips  Bro, no tacos?  No, it's still tacos  But it wasn't in the bag  I still tacos  But the tacos weren't in the bag  I have no idea what you said  Apparently one chef forgot  He's dealing with fancy men  I thought they were gonna  Bring some tacos  But I guess they  They couldn't get it 
[01:54:30]  Dude, they're preparing today  For a giant day  This is great that we get  The free shit they put on the table  Before you get to order  Hey, what?  What?  You didn't bring any glasses  Of water, too?  Yeah  I hear Nobu is sending over  Some napkins next week  And even the help is left  Dissatisfied  No tacos  No tacos  Epic fail  This is a pretty big fail  What's left  When two wealthy broadcasters  Are praying for pedestrian food?  The Olive Garden brought us  Brought us some Melba toast  And breadsticks one day  It was fantastic  And a blooming onion  I'd kill for a blooming onion 
[01:55:00]  Right now, Jesus  How can a segment  Maintain its length  When things go so awry?  Our food segment  Has hit a new low, Ro  You know what?  I loved the guacamole  And this salsa's very good  So is Paul Newman's  Will Opie and Anthony persevere?  You could at least  Made the guac in front of us  I know  Because that's always fun, too  We totally fucked it up  This just flopped  And what on earth  Is he saying?  Tacos and salsa  And guacamole  I do amigo  Give me see you, sir  Let's get the envelopes going  All on the next  Very special  Opie and Anthony show 
[01:55:30]  Can we tease the fact  That we might be eating  Pumpernickel  After the break?  That worked out  That's pretty good  Nice  Very good  That happened this week, too  Yeah, that was Monday  A week of radio  I love the Roland  Hey, give it the tag  Of the bag  Our final food break  Oh, that was it  That was it, huh?  Yeah  Not allowed to have  Any more food breaks  We shouldn't  Oh, hell no  I look forward to the next one  We should  Every time they say 
[01:56:00]  He wants to bring someone in  We should say  Do they work at a kitchen?  And if the answer is yes  No  All they do is  They come in  They talk about  Their great restaurants  No matter who they are  I don't think Roland's  Happy with that  Roland, why are you in here?  He knows it's true, though  He knows  And you're wearing  Your Rangers shirt  Because they finally won  Did they win the Stanley Cup?  No  Two more rounds  Yeah, we got a while to go  But they finally won a game  Gives a fuck  Why are you here?  Food, Roland?  No more food  No more food

[01:57:30]  Right  Yeah  Any of that  Right  Talking about the Cronut  I've had it with waiting for the Cronut guy  I'm absolutely done  He has stood us up time and time again  Excuses come from his wife  That we're being mean  When all we do is support the guy  And I don't even know why  Yeah  Yeah, yeah  Fucking Tom and Jerry was being filled in his restaurant  And we're fucking being messed up  Why all of a sudden  We got to treat this guy  With the fucking reverence 
[01:58:00]  Like this  Like, you know  Who is he?  Because he came up with the Cronut  Oh  Hey, look  I'm sure he's a great chef  I'll go to his restaurant  I'll pay for my food  I don't need free shit  Yeah, exactly  Just go and pay for it  I thought crumbs came up with the Cronut  Oh, God  That crumbs  Cronut was the worst fucking thing I ever tasted  Terrible  It was terrible  Terrible  It was like eating a skull  That is like a powdered skull  A powdery skull  Dug out of the desert  Right  It was terrible  See, that was nice 
[01:58:30]  You've had enough waiting  Oh, I know  We're going to hear like  Well, his wife  His wife still isn't sure  Isn't sure?  What the fuck?  In June  Why do we got to prove ourselves to this guy?  Pastries  Fucking baker  Yeah, only because we've been nice about it  And the guy comes in  He does a Jenny Hutt show  Right  He came around at four at that time  That's still  We're the Cronuts of radio  Yes  Exactly  I look forward to his visit  You do?  Yeah  It's not going to happen  It's going to be worth the wait  With great anticipation  Yes 
[01:59:00]  Can I ask you a question?  Sure  Are you enjoying the food segments more because they annoy Jim?  Of course  Yes  They don't really  It's not that they annoy me  I don't mind doing nothing  They're annoying me  We're just going to sit down like dickheads and eat  That's what we do  It's just that there's nothing to do with these guys  They're so delicious  They're fucking phenomenal  I love to eat  I love free shit  We made the guacamole thing into something  We did, yes  That turned out to be really fun actually  We did  Just beating the shit out of the guy for not delivering tacos  And we were able to repurpose  Yes 
[01:59:30]  We got a repurpose out of it  I stand corrected  They're terrific segments  And the listeners love hearing us fucking eat  We don't want to do real interviews  We just sit here  I'm hungry  How about you?  Me too  Oh fucking delicious  What happened?  Well we get there early  We prepare the food  Then we have to be very careful  Because we carry on whatever nationality they are  It's a fucking shit segment every time  See we got a bit out of it  Yes we did  But June 12th is barbecue week  That's another bit  Add that to the bits we've gotten out of the bad food segments  Did you hear what Rollins just said?

[02:01:00]  Like crumbs cronuts  Right  Like we're copycat cronut makers  Like dried crusty  Horrible tasting things  None of them are good  Guy Fieri is the only one  Who's kind of like a cool  They're all nice guys  Right  In their world  Bourdain is really good  But none of them interest me  Because I don't understand that world  And they don't give you any real information  Other than they're great chefs  He treats you guys like  Like nudnicks  See the secret is  That I put a little saffron  In here  And it's what  And you're like  Shut up 
[02:01:30]  Here's how every  Here's how every interview  Should go  Here's how every interview  Should go  Can you ask  Our chef please  How  You know  Something about his restaurant  So where is this restaurant  Here in New York City  Well  I don't  Care  Barbecue pits  All the way down that long hallway  Oh wow  Just cooking  They're going to bring the smoker outside

[02:04:00]  Oh fuck him  Yeah I am tired of being treated like  I'm being treated like  We're waiting for a fucking A-lister  Asshole by a fucking guy that makes donuts  Isn't today the anniversary of the Kronut?  I think tomorrow is  Oh cool  Let's celebrate by jerking off into our own mouths  Who gives a fuck?  So today would have been the day  To have the Kronut  Of course  Exactly  On the anniversary  Here's an anniversary Kronut guys  Right  Thanks for sticking up for me  Right  While they were filming Willard in my restaurant  See  Another bit from the food segment 
[02:04:30]  See that's  Jimmy doesn't understand  See all these bits we got from the food segment  Running on the inside of the Kronut like a wheel  Shit  It's like a fucking Disney movie  You guys are blown  And now we're going to have to wait until July  You know what you're doing here  Oh no  For the RISD  Now you're going to have to wait until July  For the bicentennial cookie dildos  They're really great  They have the red, white, and blue  And you squeeze them  And cookie cum  Shirts in your face  While it's a grand old flag place  This is fucking crazy 
[02:05:00]  Why are we waiting so long for this guy?  Because man, that's worth the wait  Especially since we were ready  That's worth the wait  We're rebooked  I'd rather just go the fuck down there and buy one  And that'll be the end of it  Kronut's an amazing piece of food  He's never fucking sent up Kronuts here for this show  He sent one for fucking  For Wolverine  Is there anything about other stuff here? 
[02:05:30]  Pass around?  I just wanted to try one of his fucking Kronuts  I thought you guys did try it  No  I tried  I never sent one  I tried one at E-Rock's house  For his Christmas party  Because you brought one  You brought one  Oh, that's when Roland brought his dessert  And tucked it under his chair  Well, he didn't  He didn't have confidence in the desserts  That would be offered at E-Rock's house  So he brought  Brought a backup  Yes, he did  A couple, a few sections  Strapped to his ankle  His backup Kronut  Yeah  He had some of Dominic Ansell's creations 
[02:06:00]  In a bag  And he broke out  And who could lost his mind?  Well, they were all single servings  That's when I couldn't party guests  They bring gourmet desserts in single servings  In single servings  Yeah, we all got like one little bite of the Kronut  I expected some regular old Dunkin' Donuts  That's what he did  Roland brings his gourmet shit  It was good though  They're missing out  That is a tasty donut  And now you're pissing off the Kronut guys  And now you're going to have to wait longer  For the Kronut  You can't just go down there and get one in 
[02:06:30]  You're going to have to wait in line  Oh, yeah  Why should I be treated special?  I think it's silly  I think it's  Because we were  It's like after a point  We're going to do an interview with the guy  But what are we going to talk to him about?  Who cares what he has to say?  I have zero interest  Zero  We love Roland  So we don't want to blow up his spots  But that's not our world  If he wanted to show up  I'd go out  Talk to him during a break  And say, oh, hey, great, nice  Thank you for bringing the Kronuts  Take some bites of a Kronut  Come back in and do a show  Like he was never here  But that's our talent 
[02:07:00]  We spin shit  Yeah, but we give some chicks  Running around with their tits out  Now we get fucking guys coming and going  Well, you ought to try this sauce  Fuck you!  We're good at spinning shit  We would make something out of it  Yeah, but it's like  If we're doing terrible segments  And then just being forced to spin them  That's like  We don't want to just  It's like we're reacting to an awful  Yeah  Guest  Which is, you know  A good thing that we can do that  But once in a while  I would love to have a couple  Hey, why don't you lick her tits?  Only if she jiggles them  Okie dokie  Right  Jiggle them  But that would be  Just for us as well 
[02:07:30]  Because listeners are kind of like  Over the whole nudity on the radio thing  That's true  But I think they would rather hear chicks  Talking about blowing people  Than a guy talking about  Too much sugar and salt  I think you're right  As a guy  As a guy I would rather  Even though  We're not allowed to have the girls do anything though  That's the problem  Well we should talk to them  We're literally not allowed  To do any of that shit anymore  I'd still rather hear them talk dirty  But then fucking  Some guy talking about his sauce process  I'd say we just do it anyway  I saw pictures on  Owen Day show  I think it was the Instagram  Everything is Owen Day show 
[02:08:00]  Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter  Yes  And they had  Iraq had old pictures of the money snatch  Oh yeah  We can't do that anymore  Hell no  The whole bit was  The girls could grab as much money  In the studio as possible  There was  How many  I don't know  Thousands on the floor  Thousands on the floor  In all sorts of  Denominations  And  The best part of that bit is  They had to  Stuff it up their holes  Yeah  They could keep  Whatever money  They could shove in their vaginas 
[02:08:30]  Right  You can't do that bit anymore  And that's what made that bit hilarious  The women had to make sure  There was nothing in their hands  At the end of the contest  Yep  We could do money honey  We could do money honey  Yeah  In the new studio  We'll do it in the new studio  I mean that we  Probably should  If we're gonna do it  We shouldn't wait for that  Why?  In the new studio  We were promised  Our new boss promised us  A new studio  And we're getting one  And officially  No one  Told us that it's not happening  That's what drives me insane 
[02:09:00]  But we're  Not officially  They haven't told us  That it is either  We were told it was happening  We were told it was happening  On the break  We were not told  That was what we were told  Yeah  That there'd be a complete remodel  And we may  In the wrap around week  We may have to do another studio  Because you're gonna be gone  So we're off that week  It's definitely gonna be done that week  But maybe in the days  Before and after  Officially  No one has told us  It's not happening  And I know it's not happening  That's what drives me nuts  About this place  Yeah  You should have no problem  Getting back in here  After the week off  We probably won't need to go 
[02:09:30]  To another studio  You don't think so?  I don't think we'll need  A second week  We'll get new chairs or something  Oh boy  Ugh  This place  And then they wonder  Why we bitch  They don't even have the balls  To tell us it's not happening  What are they trying to save money?  I think things are just getting  Pushed around time wise  Mmm  For what reason?  They like to do it all  In one shot  Yeah but that  But we were promised  A new studio before  The rest of the remodel  Well money talks 
[02:10:00]  And bullshit walks  Whoa  I also heard  They're not doing blue carpet  On the entire floor  Like they did upstairs  No  No  What?  Why are you laughing Sam?  The cake stained  Fucking blue carpet  I know who you heard that from  Because he was obsessing  About it one day  Kenny  Are they not doing the blue carpet  Upstairs for the executives  And people who are out of the public eye  So they're all the behind the scenes people  Go upstairs  It's amazing how nice it is  And down here is still a shithole 
[02:10:30]  And they started  They made the lobby look really nice  I should say that  It's beautiful  And then there's a blue carpet  That goes down in the studios  And I thought this whole place  Would have blue carpet  Just like they have upstairs  Supposedly they've stopped  With the blue carpet  They did just enough  To make it look like  The whole place is nice  So when you're in the lobby  You can look up that hallway  And it's nice  But the second you turn the corner  It's fucking  Oh and there's a million corners to turn  Yeah  That's what I'm hearing  It makes they do it for the executives  That no one cares  Yeah the big celebrities 
[02:11:00]  Are the ones you want to try to impress  And show them how nice this place is  Not upstairs  You know why they're not doing it over here?  Shade 45  They don't want to make the neighborhood look nicer  When it's you know  An urban neighborhood let's say  And then we suffer too  Well they should just put  You know  Train tracks  I think they should have a train track  Type of carpet  Carpet with a train track pattern  And just lay it right between  Our studio and there  How mad would they get  If we just put train tracks  Between us and there 
[02:11:30]  Can we do that one day?  I'd love that  Can we please do that one day?  Yes  The train tracks  So can we do money snatch or not?  We can do money honey  No I want money snatch  The girls have to use their holes  Come on  Shove it up your virginity  I think we were responsible back then  I think they did shove it into a condom  Or something  I believe  Yeah  I think that was just so they could get it in  Money kind of makes  It has sharp edges  If you stack it together  So they rolled a condom up there  And then there was lube also 
[02:12:00]  Right  They covered it in lube  And just were fucking  Yeah  Mueling that shit up there  Right  We can do money honey  Huh?  Money honey is not the same  No it's not  But it was fun  What is that?  Honey all over them  And then the money sticks  And then they roll around  Yeah we did that one  And then you know  You end up in a situation  Where you got stalker Patty  And you can pour cereal and condiments  All over her  We did that  Oh yeah we did do that  That's a lot of fun  It looked like that scene  From American History X  In the grocery store  With the girl at the checkout counter 
[02:12:30]  That's what it looked like  Right  It's pouring milk on her face  And throwing yogurt at her  There's one difference  Oh yeah well  White  Alright so  The chronic guy will be here in June  No he won't  Not if I have any say  I'm glad we act like a fucking top rated show  Okay good  When can he come?

You're all about the big  Having good name guests on the show  We've been disrespected by that guy  Time and time again  No  And his wife  Him and his wife  Have disrespected  We're just grabbing our ankles  Taking crullers in our assholes  What's wrong with us?  His wife's  Fucking cares  His wife's still a little scared  Scared 
[02:13:30]  We've given the guy  So much publicity  A little bit  In the middle of a Hugh Jackman interview  He walks in  Oh my god  Remember that?  He was told to  I mean he didn't  That was a big moment though  Not for us  Hugh Jackman trying to cronut?  Don't give a fuck about it  It was good for him  And good for Hugh Jackman  Exactly  Hey how was your treat?  It was at the end of the Hugh Jackman interview  It was  We were wrapping up with the  You know what should have happened  In the fucking hallway  With the Hugh Jackman interview  Here you go on your way out  Superstar  Here's a fucking  Here's a donut  I think he got a little pressed 
[02:14:00]  Yeah  Huh?  Got a little pressed  Yeah  Yeah  Was our name in there?  Yeah  Well  That's how we're getting pressed  A celebrity tries a fucking pastry  And our name's in there  Your name's in there  That's good  We should change the name of the show  To  A radio show  Yeah  A radio show  And then we'll get a lot of publicity  He was walking out of  A radio show  Yeah  Hey that's us  See  It's on the wall  I don't know  I've had it 
[02:14:30]  I've had it with  No you haven't  Treating some of these guests  Like they're fucking royalty  Oh fuck it  I'm fed up  No  And he is the prime example  Of somebody that should just  There it is  Look at him  Oh Hugh Jackman  Yeah  Oh yeah  It's like oh a Kronos  So we technically have had the Kronos guy on  Fantastic  Yeah  The Kronos was  Wait wait wait  Go to the beginning of this  Thank you  You gave me an excuse  To fucking tweet this video now  You heard you want a Kronos  Roland just walks in  And presents him with a Kronos 
[02:15:00]  He's the guy  That's the guy  Okay this is so bizarre to me  Because I go past your shop  And they are around the block  And I think  I wouldn't mind one  But I'm not gonna wait there for another  Exactly  And he's Hugh Jackman  You've come to me  Love a shit  Huh  Oh no I go by there many  No what happened was  At one point  I wanted one  And I went there  I waited  And then I didn't give a shit  Jim  There's no mystery to your reaction  Look at Jim's face  Oh my god  Jimmy is so pissed 
[02:15:30]  From the beginning  It's really awkward  Please  Have a Kronos  Jim is so upset  What a fake  Jimmy's looking around like  Why is this happening  During our interview  Yeah yeah yeah  And I will be retweeting this video right now  Enjoy it  I fucking never saw this video  Yeah I remember being  Your face is great  Pretty good  There's a good Kronos  Well  I've got a piece of  A jelly in the inside  There's a 
[02:16:00]  You like the part where they tell  Pause real quick  Why why  This is a good interview we're doing  Watch him eat a donut  That's what we've come down to  And I'll tell you why I was mad  I didn't know  Right  That he had been told to come in  So I'm glad I didn't say anything  I literally thought he just walked in  Yeah yeah  That face is so good  I love that face  Oh my god  But I was uh  I was actually happy after that  That I kept my mouth shut  Because  Yeah  I didn't know that he had been told to come in 
[02:16:30]  You would have done the  What are you doing  Nah but  I loved it  I just  I'm glad I didn't  Because that would have been wrong  I would have been wrong  Oh was that fucking good  Your face  It looked shock  I just kept picturing this happening  On really fucking big radio shows  Right  I just can't picture this disorganization  Ten people standing around  A donut box being passed  Hey is this jelly you put in there  Who gives a fuck  And then he tells  Well what is in there  There is an apple  I put the  If he came in and sat down next to him 
[02:17:00]  And we talked to him  It wouldn't have been that bad  Uh huh  I get it  That would have been fine  Yeah  But it was just the way it was done  It's off mic  Oh yeah  No one's running anything  Roland was very happy to present  The cronut  Sorry I'm playing through  I don't want to interrupt this  That riveting  Fucking  That riveting thing  Crazy  I'll be honest  That was really fantastic  Yeah  The cronut was fantastic  Yeah  That was fantastic  It's worth the wait 
[02:17:30]  Yeah it was a damn good bite of food  But we didn't have to wait though  Yeah yeah yeah  That's the souffle  This he can't pick it up  And just like  The hell is it  That's the new creation  From the cronut guy  It's a  It's a  It looks like something  Oh my god  It looks like something  The great Tanton would use  Thank you  Jackman passed me some  So I ate it  Oh you did  Just to share a treat  Oh look at that  Sharing a souffle  Is it good?  That was really cool  The portable souffle  Wow  Portable souffle  Embarrassing  Wonderful 
[02:18:00]  This is solid radio right here  You like it?  That's another hour  Solid  With an A-lister too  It's great  An A-lister  And one of the great inventions of 2013  One in one show  Is this a proud moment for you as a broadcaster?  Fuck yeah  Like we're on the same  We have the same bodies that we're working with  I would love to see Hugh Jackman just  I'll eat something  And I'll see somebody in perfect shape  Throw his arm out of there  See those fucking  You know  Those knives come out of his knuckles  And he just stabs the chronic guy in the throat  Now that would be something 
[02:18:30]  One claw come  And just  You'd like that  Oh I would love to watch him kill him like Wolverine  Cheap plug  I just tweeted the video  And you really gotta look at Jim Noren's  Jimmy's face the whole time is the greatest  I remember being furious  Because I wish I have no monitor in front of me  And I was like  I literally thought they just walked in and interrupted  I'm not saying the interview is the world class  But it was like  I just thought like Jesus Christ  Are we on that level of fucking disorganization 
[02:19:00]  And interrupted  In all fairness  You don't face the door  So there are times  Like I'm getting all sorts of signals  And what happened that day was  We were sort of wrapping up  And Dominic was here with the cronut  And I'm thinking  You know what  This could maybe get us impressed  That's all I was thinking  I'm like wait  Fucking Hugh Jackman A-lister  Trying the cronut  That might get a little something going for us  He uses a bloody cronut double  And sometimes I get your reaction before I do it Jimmy  But I went like this  I was actually waving  Like come on in  So I don't know if you were looking down  Or away or whatever 
[02:19:30]  That's why I'm glad I didn't say anything  They absolutely didn't just walk in  Yeah no I know  That's why I'm glad I kept my mouth shut  You're trying to set up something that might  You know  Might get us some heat  I'm just happy I kept my mouth shut  Oh it's great  Alright why don't we take a break  And uh  Do I look annoyed in the video?  Huh?  Do I look annoyed?  Wow do you  You look so annoyed  You're looking around like  Wow do you  What the fuck is this?  Wow do you  I love it  It's only for the first part of it  I think people are gonna have a good laugh  Oh yeah  They're gonna have a good laugh at your reaction  Okay we'll continue in just a bit

[02:22:30]  Well  That guy  He's nothing  But the people that are  Screwing you over  As far as your studio  Well  I think the listeners  Have spoken  And they get kind of  Frustrated by all the  Bitching we do  So  There's not much  We can really do about it  It's really frustrating  We're promised things  And then  Then they're just  Completely taken away from us  And then  They don't even  Tell us to our face  We have to kind of  Find out through the  The grapevine  I heard it through the  Through the grapevine  That could be a good  Fucking song  But you guys can do  A little bit 
[02:23:00]  Where you can film  Like Anthony  At the compound  Getting his sasser out  Because I'm a retired marine  He gets his 50 caliber  Put on his macarthur shades  And you guys are getting  Mobilized to go  Kick some butt  Oh that's good  Sure  That's nice  The police show up  And cave my head in  No you're just film it  You're not doing anything  I don't know  Of course  It doesn't imply any  Yeah I don't know  By the way  That show  I saw last night  I tweeted  That they still had  The whip the wow thing  What?  On their website  92.3  Are they still  Is it still up there? 
[02:23:30]  The guy's trying to make believe  He's having fun  With the whole thing  But he's not having fun  The hate coming his way  Is brutal  It's brutal  No one wants to be called  A hack thief  And we don't even need  To really you know  Talk much about it today  Because the listeners  Have taken it upon themselves  To just you know  Make it hurt a bit  So  Well I think you guys  You guys are like  The good  Not only is it still up there  But they added  The hashtag  Whip him out Wednesday  To the  Yeah right  Well I saw that yesterday  It's not gonna

Oh god  I don't know if he is or not  I saw on his twitter  That it looked like  He had done stand up  Or maybe he just did  An event there  But as a stand up  If he is  How can you feel good  About that  You should know that  Yeah  Maybe they probably  Said to him  Look dude  It's an old bit  Don't worry about it  Oh and I don't care  Maybe he's looking at it  Like it was a war of the roses  But once you know  He should be all over them  Saying take this fucking thing 
[02:24:30]  Off the website  Yeah I look like an idiot  And it's one of those  Benchmark bits  One of those really  Just over the top bits  That we are so known for  So it's an embarrassing  It's an embarrassment to him  So he can spin it all he wants  But it's really embarrassing  For the guy  When you get 24 hours of tweets  I mean the tweets were brutal  Oh yeah  You're a hack  And you're a thief  I don't care who you are  In the business  Right  You suck is one thing  But you're a hack  Or you're a thief  Like those are things  You never want to hear  No  As a performer  Right  And there's no way  To have fun with that

[02:28:30]  And the problem is  And he'll be mad that we said this  But it is the truth  I've been pushing him hard  Because we only got five months left in this contract  And I'm like what are you doing  Like you know  There's major issues here  What are you doing  Get in there rock  Right  What are you doing  To try to maybe  You know  Get other suitors  What are you doing  To try to make it a better situation here for us  And the fact is  He's  He fell off  I don't know what the hell happened to the guy  And then everyone's like  We'll get another one  I don't even know who else to get  I don't know

[02:29:30]  How much more  It's not  It's just  It's just not fair  Does he have a bigger audience  For SiriusXM?  Sure  But we're not that far behind  And I  I've been told  That our channel  Actually beats  You know  Howard 101  I believe that  In streaming and all that  So you know  We're not that far behind  But we are treated  Just not well  Compared to him  And that's frustrating to us  Boo hoo  I'll get ahead everyone  Boo hoo  Boo hoo

[02:36:00]  It's person shit  Dropping hammers  On someone's driveway  That's a very good question  Maybe I should have  Read the whole article  Oh I will  Okay  Authorities believe  The unknown man  Is committing the act  Between one and four a.m.  But a motive for crimes  Has not yet been established  I think the neighbors  Are laughing about it  But that's because  It's only happened  To two houses  In the neighborhood  I swear  If someone shit  In my driveway  I would have laughed  It's pretty funny  I would have laughed  If it starts happening more  I think people might  Become enraged  They shit for my neighbors 
[02:36:30]  And I did nothing  And when they came  To shit on my driveway  No one was left  To help me  Something like that  You're absolutely right  Says Amy  Who lives in the heights  How much poop  Can one man make though?

Aren't there security cameras  Everywhere?  Yeah  I think  Read on

Three  One driveway  Has been hit six times  I thought there was  A number before that  Alright  Sergeant Mosier agrees  That revenge could be  The motive  As he recalls  A similar event  Many years ago  In the Houston area  Though it has been  Amusing for some  In the neighborhood  Law enforcement officials  Are taking the case  Very seriously  And have beefed up 
[02:38:00]  Patrols in the area  To catch the man  Still pictures  From surveillance  Video footage  Shows the suspect  To be an older  Balding  Hispanic man  With a mustache  Who wears shorts  See  Some are honest  Some are great stories  That's it  Everything  We're great  Well  Why do you park your butt  In the driveway  But drive your butt  In the parkway  Hey there we go  There you go  That's my big joke  About shit in the driveway  Weird news  Yeah maybe this guy

[02:39:00]  And the dogs too  What the hell  He hit his wife  In the head  With a fucking like  Kerosene heater  Wow  Yeah  Smashed her with a  Kerosene heater  And he  Shot her  I guess  And then he strangled  The bird  Boked the bird's neck  And then he shot the dog  I guess  He found a text message  She sent  Which is like  I just got home  And my husband's  Talking crap already  Come on  No way  So yeah  He killed her  The parrot  And three dogs  Wow  Yeah  And then he killed himself  Yeah  No he tried to

[02:40:00]  Wait  You weren't kidding  About the grave  The mother's grave  The mother's grave  Thing  Uh  Penton later  Told police  That he took  The flowers  From his mother's grave  And decorated his wife's body  After he killed her  Wow that's fucking  Bizarre  He was in the bathroom  Passed out  After washing down  Some hydrocodone  With rum  Wow  He hit her  He hit her with a kerosene heater  I'm guessing that came first  Um  Cause there was a lot of blood  He said  I guess he said  He hit her nose  So maybe he smashed her  In the face with it  And then he just shot her 
[02:40:30]  Three times  But that's a marriage  That's been on the rocks  For a while  Damn  Yeah  Wow  Alright  Matt  He's in there  He's in there  I remember that  That was a cartoon  Bug's body  And then they killed  Yeah  Was it Bug's body?

[02:46:00]  And better than ever  On Sirius XM  Oh  Remember this  This was a weird song  And then I went down and paused my penis  That's stupid  I never really liked this  Detachable penis 
[02:46:30]  Is there a reason you're playing this?  Did someone lose their penis?  No  You just like it?  It's always got to be a tie-in  Oh you like it?  It's a good rejoiner  He likes it  Without that pesky detachable part  He wanted to find out where it was  He could grab it  Yes so he could get it with his asshole  Yeah  This is when you could play like  They don't really do novelty songs on the radio anymore  Right  Everything's like  Yeah they don't really  You know  Everything's got to be a big hit  I don't know  This was a big K-rock hit 
[02:47:00]  It was  This one back in like the 90s  Yeah  It's like  Could you  I remember working at AAF  And they'd call in  Could you play detachable penis?  But it was  Kind of laughing  It was all just stoners  And little kids like me  That were like  Penis  Penis right?  Penis  Dude he took it off  And it's like  Someone took it  Detachable  That's the only reason anyone liked the song  Yeah  Yeah  Like I would sing that song  But not know the tune at all 
[02:47:30]  I would just say  Detachable penis all the time  Just hearing penis  Right  Was like crazy  It was just funny  Look  That's like a fucking  That's like a dog whistle  For Sal  He came running into the studio  Because he heard the word penis  King missile?  Yes  King missile  Thank you sir  Did someone say just  Very fast of you  And good working  Like  The intern is stepping up his game  Since his humiliation  Yeah  Yeah  Oh yeah 
[02:48:00]  I was going to mention it earlier  I watched that fucking documentary  About Branson  Branson, Missouri  We played the trailer for it  And it made it seem really ominous  Yeah  It was called  We Always Lie to Strangers  And it had leaves  So I thought it was good  There's the leaves  South by Southwest Film Festival  World premiere  And then it's got the little leaves  On the side of it  But if you look at what's inside the leaves  All that says was  That it premiered at South by Southwest  At South by Southwest  It doesn't say anybody liked it 
[02:48:30]  It doesn't say anybody even went to see it  Not at all  It doesn't say anything good about it  But you put those little leaves around it  Like the little fucking wreath leaf  Around what you wrote  And people think  Oh, this is critically acclaimed  You think Robert Redford  Has hand-selected this  Right  Right  Oh, Tribeca  Oh, Bob De Niro liked this one  No  It means nothing, the leaves  And so I go to watch this thing  Because the trailer really made  Look like something was going on 
[02:49:00]  In Branson, Missouri  That wasn't being told to the public  We always lie to strangers  And I'm glad that you saw it  Because like  I saw that it was on iTunes  Yep  But I'm not in the habit of paying 12 bucks  For a movie I'm not sure about  I'll burn $12  I know you will  Just for the fun of it  I know  You know what happens when I run out of cat toys  For Lil' Beavis?  What?  $100 bills  I just roll them up and throw them on the floor  Found a few under the couch the other day  Is that right?  Adorable  That is adorable  Yeah  It's what I do 
[02:49:30]  It's what I do  So endearing too  Exactly  But yeah  But it did said  Like the movie's called  We always lie to strangers  Yeah  And it said  It's not always as it appears to be  Right  So I'm thinking  Seedy underbelly  That's what I was thinking  And then there was this other theory  That perhaps  Because there are a lot of  What they call show folk  In Branson, Missouri  That a lot of the dancers  And singers and what not  Are gay  And then since this is the Bible Belt 
[02:50:00]  The wholesome place  That people go  For wholesome entertainment  That they gotta keep their gayness under wraps  Or perhaps there's gay beatings  Or bashings going on  In Branson  I'm thinking everything  Like what the fuck could this be  That's going on in Branson  Why they call this movie  We always lie to strangers  They said that they took  Four to five years to film it  To film it  And they're following families  So now that you say that  You're like yeah  There may be a gay dude  Just living with his wife  And his kid  Right, right, right  There was one instance of gay  And that was some guy 
[02:50:30]  That was married to a woman  Had kids  Left  And hooked up with a guy  That was it  But there was no  No controversy about it  No one cared  No one  So  So I'm watching this movie  And it's going on  And on and on  And I'm starting to realize  And getting more and more pissed  That what this is  They follow  Primarily two families  That have had this show  A couple of shows in Branson  Over the years  Since like the middle of the 60s 
[02:51:00]  There  That's the movie  That was it  What happens  When they follow the families  They show them singing  And dancing  Badly  Who cares about them  No one  Why are you showing this family  I'm not Jimmy  I was so angry  This show  I'm like here's grandpa  And he started it  And then the father  And the kids  And they're all  Like  Like  Dancing and singing  I was so mad 
[02:51:30]  That this amounted to nothing  There was no controversy  No weird  Underbelly  Nothing  It was a commercial  For these two families  And their shitty  Shitty fucking show  That I don't know  Who would pay to see  You weren't impressed  By the show  I  Well there was some  Singing and dancing  That was marvelous  They're like the shittiest  What do they lie about  They lied about the movie  Pretty much  That's the only lie  I could see  We always lie to strangers  We tell them that the movie  Is something it's not  I don't know what the 
[02:52:00]  The lie is  There was no lie  So there's no hook  No hook  No weirdness  No  No like  Oh that's where they were going  It's not like  Oh it started as this  And ended  It just ends as  Yeah they  Seriously  They sing and dance  Ends  That they're still there  Doing their shows  But there's so  Like why the fuck  Would somebody walk around  With a jacket with fringes on  Like there's gotta be  Something  It's cool though  It is  Yeah  It's gotta be something worth  Do not waste your money  Anybody  That's the play 
[02:52:30]  They're wearing fucking  They're holding microphones  That's obviously the play  Oh you think that guy's  An audience member they brought up  Or is he a member of the family  That looks like a Q&A  No  Q&A  About the movie  I don't know how they could  Sell this movie  I don't know how people  How they could like  Yeah  Go to South by Southwest  And go  Alright we're gonna have a screening  And then we're gonna talk with  I'd be like  What the  The second the lights come up  What the fuck was that  Question one  Yeah question one  What the fuck was that  You're presented in this way  Where we're gonna learn something 
[02:53:00]  Nothing  It was a  Bore  If it was presented  As just what it was  It would be a boring version of that  Why should we care about your family  Yeah  Do you have a clip of the guy singing  Oh  No I can look for it though  Please do so  Yeah cause I'd like to see a bit of this show  Maybe the show is so exquisite  That it's worth  That is true  Those Branson shows  And they show the audience  And they're all people that are over 60 at least  All of them  And they sit there and tap their hand on the wooden armrest 
[02:53:30]  There it is  And it's just  A boar fest of a show  Is this it?  The Presley family it was  And they're not even  You know  No Elvis relation?  No  Not at all  Presley's country jubilee  Here it is  83 years young  Mr. Lloyd Presley  83  And then Lloyd Presley comes out  He's 83 years young  There's no celebrity connection to these people  It's not like they used to be  None  Now he's singing  I agree with George Sterling 
[02:54:00]  Yeah  All those people shouldn't be  Yeah  And Jim Crow was a friend of mine  And they got the whole family out there  Us singing  Could you imagine sitting and watching this fucking shit?  You know how this should end?  Like Scarface did  When that stupid fucking guy came out in that mask  It just ruins it  With the guy wearing the fucking sunglasses 
[02:54:30]  Yes  And the member's only jacket with the one shotgun  Here he comes  Who wears a fucking shade to an assassination?  Look at that audience  A bunch of white headed fucking  This looks like they just had an open stage  And anybody who had enough people could put on a show  Could put on a show  And then like  You're thinking they're going to interview like the family members or something  They're going to be like  Well  When I came out to my family  They beat me senseless 
[02:55:00]  Like something  Yeah  There was nothing  What are they talking about?  About how they got into the show business area in Branson  And how they built the place  And got their relatives to  Exactly  And I kept on  I'm like there's gotta  Because I was watching it thinking  There's got  This can't be it  There's gotta be  The big  Turn  Where it's like  The underbelly  Oh that's what they're getting at  No touching in funny spots 
[02:55:30]  Not one touched kid  Not one fucking  Bit of racism  Not any  You know that town  That town's gotta be littered with racism and homophobia  Has to be  I just like the fact that Anthony's idea of a bad movie is that there's no kid touching a racism  Or homophobia  There's two thumbs down from Anthony Comia  Who says if I can't relate to it I won't watch it  There's nobody over 80 that wears bedazzled country music jackets that accepts everybody 
[02:56:00]  Grandpa Presley does  Yeah  Get your big lips off my water fountain  You've got one of your own  This diner's for whites only  Yes sir  Oh I'll pour mustard in your kinky hair at the war's counter  Bang bang  Yeah so uh  And you watched the whole movie thinking that at some point  At some point  And it went on and on and on  And then I checked you know the timeline  I'm like there's an hour left 
[02:56:30]  An hour  And it was like just  Already felt like I'd sat through three hours  Of this shite  But it's not a long movie  It's just regular length  No it felt really long  But it felt  And it doesn't even look good  There's nothing even that you're like  Wow that's a good shot  It's just basic shots of the dumb fucking act  And then regular sit down interviews with the dumb fucking people  So it just seemed like somebody went in  They were like I really like this Branson town  I'm gonna interview these people  Five years in the making?  Let's see what they're saying then  Maybe they have something interesting 
[02:57:00]  Maybe something interesting  There's just two guys  Are they brothers?  I don't know  Who the fuck cares?  Comfortable  And it also feels very um  Uh  Almost capital  On the filmmaker  They don't have to try too hard  To give you  What they're giving you  Yeah  Well it sucks  Maybe he's trying  How they eat and breathe  Right  But in reality  They're  Oh they're all sitting on like a patio  With fucking  Shitty red chairs  No arms on them  Talking like artists  This is terrible  Whatever  But they're thinking about like 
[02:57:30]  You know exactly what they want to give to people  Oh is that the lie?  Something that we discovered right away  And made us think like  Oh we're dealing with some really smart people  And that's kind of  And also part of  Peeling back the layers  Finding some folks who maybe you don't expect  Wow  Awful  That was it?  I guess they're being interviewed about the movie  They come off so simple in Branson  But there's a lot going on behind the scenes  That was so fuck bad  Did you find them to be simple people? 
[02:58:00]  Yes  All the way through  What was his other documentary?  Water the Universal Solvent?  Fucking stinkeroo  You don't think he got deep into anything?  Nothing  This guy's useless  Did he make any more?  Any other movies?  Something about  Kurt Cobain about a son  And you're probably like  That was another one  He probably convinced people  Oh we're going to get the real behind the scenes  Of what Kurt Cobain was like  Oh yeah  It's a whole documentary on just the video 
[02:58:30]  Smells like teen spirit  Yeah  You know the guy pushing the mop was actually  Yes  Or he's hunting down Kurt Cobain's combs  Oh it's awful  Don't waste your money  We talked it up pretty good here  When we saw the trailer  Thinking  Finally Branson exposed  And nothing  Yakov was in it for two seconds  They showed him at some fundraiser thing  He was like  Hello  And that was it  Like they didn't focus on anyone that 
[02:59:00]  You know  Kirby  Pierce Arrow  None of the big acts  Nothing  No  What about Greg Brady  Greg Brady  They showed like a billboard  With the Brady brunch  On it for like two seconds  Why wouldn't you follow the Brady brunch  If you're in Branson  Wouldn't you get a whole thing of Branson  Like not just these two useless families  But you'd think you'd get  You know  Hey we're going to talk to Greg Brady  Yeah like  We'll talk to Yakov  These families are convinced  What they're doing is awesome  Let's find real families  That understand that this town is insane 
[02:59:30]  Right  Something out of the Twilight Zone  This is a bizarre area  Yeah I think they just  Went in there trying to find something  And they found nothing  And they were like fuck  By the time they left  They had a shitload of film  And had to do something with it  It's been five years  Yeah  Let's get some  Let's get some leaves  Let's figure out where we can go  Put some leaves on the trailer  Are there any free places  That will show our movie  That will give us leaves  Yeah that gives us leaves  That we can put on the side  Of the fucking trailer  When you have to put 
[03:00:00]  Where the movie premiered  In leaves  In the leaves  There's no awards  No  Seen by critics  Yes  Viewed by eyes  We're just on the sidewalk  Of South by Southwest  Trying to show people  Look on an iPad  Look at the movie  Look here it is  Yeah  Is that the guy  That made the movie  Or  Why is he wearing  That stupid jacket  We figured out  The stories we were telling  We wanted to make a film  That would sort of surprise  Sounds like Sal  That would surprise people  It does  Oh wow  St. Louis and New York  Dresses like it too 
[03:00:30]  Yeah  Yeah I mean it felt like  You know a film that  I mean I think you know  You know my politics  Are much more radical  Than anybody on screen  In this film  This is good audio quality  Wow  There's also a lot more diversity  Even in the place  Branson is the core  Of red state America  I mean you know  It's a city that  Were there anyone  Who really showed that  White in the movie  No a lot of white people  Just white people  Just white people in Branson  So you weren't sitting there  Being like wow  This is a really diverse  Showing of  No diversity whatsoever  In Branson 
[03:01:00]  So what are they talking about  I don't know  I couldn't understand it  Through his microphone  Yeah  I think Mars is his engineer  Oh poor Mars  Yeah  Can you hear him for a second  On that mic face  Yeah  Let me hear his dumb mic  I'll just see how the guy  That's actually not  What I'm going to do  Since I had to find  Um initially  He's pointing at somebody else  He thought the movie  Was going to be  You think they have  Good mic technique  It fucking stinks  That big fall in a puddle  Before he used it  What these guys found out  After time was  Was it fine  He's awful 
[03:01:30]  You're young in Branson  You're working with your family  And  It's too tight to be buttoned  That button  Begging for mercy  It's awful  It's the fucking penguin  From Batman  Enough of this guy  And how do you wear  A bedazzled jacket  With fringes  And not know how to  Talk into a mic properly  It's really terrible  To  Finding these wonderful  Rich layered  Nuanced stories  There's no layers  In this story  It's a nuanced story  Ant  But it evolved over time  And it became the story  It's over time  You have to understand  The amount  This is angering me 
[03:02:00]  Because I've seen this  And it's so bad  That the way they're  Talking about it  Makes it sound like  Wow there's so many  Layers  And you'll be so  Interested in their stories  No  Yeah I don't know  What you're talking about  I'm actually re-interested  In seeing the movie  Oh see because you're  Listening to the guy's  Fucking terrible microphone  Yeah they're talking  Just like this  And it's really good  The guy's going  So what happened  What was the process  We decided to shoot him  For a couple of years  I want my mic  To sound like  The announcements  On an MTA train  Please  Terrible 
[03:02:30]  Yeah  Billy in Arkansas  Wants to tell us  What really goes on  In Branson  What's up Billy  Hey guys  You're right  The thing about Branson  Is  I go up there  It's the nearest place  Around here  To like go watch a movie  Or something  As far as a big theater  Wow  And most of the  Most of the places  Up there  The big names  You know we went  Branson went to a big boom  Back in the early 90's  Mid 90's  Where all these big name  Country stars  Were moving in there  So they're all gone 
[03:03:00]  You drive down  Through the main drag  In Branson  And it's just real estate  Signs everywhere  These million dollar  Places that got built  Are up for sale  And the only ones left  Are like those old people  That you're talking about  The Presleys  And the  Pierce  Wow  So when it had this  When it had this big boom  Going on there  Like people were like  Oh we gotta get over  To Branson  And make some cash  So like what  Merle Haggard  Would go down there  Or something  Yeah Merle Haggard  Waylon Jennings 
[03:03:30]  Johnny Cash  Was up there  Willie Nelson  And some of them  Even built  Lawrence Welk  Built a theater there  Lawrence Welk  It's fucking 1950's  Lawrence Welk  And he's been dead  How long  Yeah quite a while  Two weeks  Yeah  Let's see who else  Was up there  Dick Clark  Well  Isn't it amazing  That in two sentences  This caller  Seems to have made you  More interested in Branson  Than that whole movie  Oh okay  Now there's been  An economic decline 
[03:04:00]  And so it's only  The Presleys  And this other shit family  That are the old people  They're grandchildren  They're great grandchildren  Dancing around  And singing on a stage  Songs no one wants  To see or hear  You didn't like that song  They were singing  It was awful  Yes  We gonna drop  Kick a Jew  The only ones  That are left  Are the ones  That started it  You know what I'm saying  Oh by the way  This reminds me  Remember to catch me  My brother Joe  And my sister  Tomorrow in Patchogue  I'm doing the same thing  In Patchogue  The whole family thing 
[03:04:30]  The whole family  Getting up there  Singing  They always lie to you  They always lie to you  In Long Island  And I don't remember  Ever seeing a black person  Up there  Never  No  I didn't see one  In the film  Nope  I never  I used to go up there  A lot  Back in the  90s  And the  But nowadays  I'll go to Fayetteville  Or somewhere  Before I go to Branson  Because it's just  Oh Fayetteville  Just the fucking  Yeah  Thank you sir  You don't want to know  Where you go to see movies  I know  Really  Fayetteville  Quick  Hold on 
[03:05:00]  Get him back on the phone  I want to know  Where he goes  For a cup of chowder  Then I saw  That Vice show  I had to watch  Something good  That one  Last Chance  High  What's that?  It's a high school  For like  I guess  They say  Emotionally disturbed kids  But it seems to me  Like most of them  Are just plain  Troublemakers  It's criminals  Yeah  There's a lot of kids  In this school  That  Are into just 
[03:05:30]  Beating up  Other kids  And it really  Is  It was an  Interesting documentary  So when you're  Saying like  Emotionally disturbed  What's your  Emotional disturbance  While I beat kids  Up and robbed them  Yeah  Yeah  I don't see how  Like there could be  A kid  I remember  Going to school  With some kids  That were  Emotionally disturbed  And mentally retarded  Yeah  And had some type  Of physical  And mental problems  They called those  Short bus kids  Right  And I went to school  With some of them  And they were like 
[03:06:00]  You know  You knew  But these kids  It's like  No these are just  Really bad kids  That are disturbing  The learning environment  For everybody involved  I'm just watching  The visual  Uh huh  And I'm thinking  That you may have  Watched this  Simply to back up  Some of your beliefs  His head  It's in Chicago  Chicken or the egg  My friend  You pick what came first  My beliefs  Or what I see  That made me believe  So  Yeah  Stop running 
[03:06:30]  That's the principle  There's this one kid  Get this fucking camera  On my motherfucking face  It's like an eight year old  Black kid  Flipping the camera off  Saying get this camera  Out my motherfucking face  Now this kid's kicking  He wants to  Beat the shit out  Of this other kid  It's like  Mini prison  It's like prison  With a bunch of  Short convicts  Stuff that I have to do  Throughout the day  He's the dean of students  Desmond Payne  Student that was  Arguing with another student  And  Turned his back  And that kid  Pulled out a gun  And shot him in his back  You know 
[03:07:00]  And that kid died  You know  And  It's sad  I know  I once set off  A bottle rocket  Down the hallway once  Yeah  Crazy  Did you immediately  Come to an explanation  For their behavior  Oh yeah  Yeah I chalked it up  To  Poverty  Horrible  Parenting  Oh  They show some of the parents  Not a father to be found  By the way  They showed a mom  Who was  With one of her kids  Who's a huge problem  In school  Two daughters  And she's there  With an infant 
[03:07:30]  Feeding it  Because she must have thought  It was a great idea  To have yet another kid  When she's just got  Three problems already  What's happening  Go back a little  Does the kids get  Taking his jacket off  And put it in the closet  Angrily  Yeah yeah  They told him  Take your jacket off  And he's like  No no  And then he took the jacket off  And then he's trying  To leave the classroom  I didn't tell him  To shut the fuck up  Yeah  Take the coat off  Take the coat off  Take the coat off  You will get it  At the end of the day  Take the coat off  Take the coat off 
[03:08:00]  I'm asking you  To take the coat off  He's like eight, nine  Yeah  One more time  Uh oh  What's his name  Rakim  Oh okay  He's put it in the closet  He puts it in there  He's all pissed  Just threw it on the floor  Slams the door  Hey  You gonna get it okay  You gonna get it  You gonna get it  You gonna get it  Don't you gonna get it  He's like 
[03:08:30]  Don't put your fingers  In my face  Now he's tripping the guy  Burn  Burn  Burn  Burn  Burn  What a bad kid  Now all this time  Is ticking by  And no one's learning  Anything in the class  He's just blocking the kid  There should just be  Again like Sparta  A cliff behind the school  And then they just  Throw the useless children  Off of the cliff  To kill them  He's just a shitty kid  Yeah  He's a bad kid 
[03:09:00]  Mmhmm  You break that  And you're really  Going to jail  Jail  But when you were that young  Would you dream of  Talking to a teacher like that  Holy fuck  But then there's something to say  If a kid is that young  What kind of a shitty place  Is he growing up in  That's what it is  Where that's what you  What you turn into  Fuck man  It's his upbringing  It's his parents  Complete lack  Of any responsibility  Accountability  Nothing  Emotional ties to the kid  Any reasonable  Perception of how  You're supposed to raise a kid 
[03:09:30]  Behavior in front of your child  All that  Gone  And that's what it makes  More  Future murderers  If that kid  Doesn't kill someone  I'd be stunned  I'd be stunned  If that kid  Does not kill someone  At some point in his life  He's nine  He's nine  You've predestined his future  I have it all  Figured out already  Spelt out  Aw poor little kid  Look at him  He's really upset  What's got him so upset? 
[03:10:00]  It looks like Earl  Every day we worked at NUW  That face right there  I can hang a picture  As long as I want  Earl hang the picture  No  Get your fingers out of my face  Yeah  They're just really  Fucked up  But the school  A few hours a day  Cannot fix  What the fuck is going on  In their home life  Right  And around their shitty  Buildings that they live in  With their shitty parents 
[03:10:30]  Do you think it's a tough place  To come in and do like  A comedy show  To entertain them?  Holy shit  I was thinking how hard  It would be to just wake up  To go to work every day  As a teacher here  Just knowing like  Oh god  I'm going to get this  So are these people  That have gone  Have they decided  I want to help  Underprivileged kids  I'm going to teach there  Or are they stuck  I think so  Like this is just  What they could get  I think so  That is a rough job man  Yeah  Like what kind of dedication  Do you have to have  As a teacher to go  I'm going to  Because you have to be  Dedicated to do that  Look at that big thing  They have on the wall  It says 
[03:11:00]  Our blooming attendance  And it shows like  How many kids  Showed up that month  September  October  And it's going down  It's going down  Way down  Our blooming attendance  Blooming means  It's coming up  Right  It's blooming  It's blossoming  It's growing  The wrong word  No  No  Like a flower  Our wilting attendance  Are dying on the vine  And this boy  He's got a big set of tits  He's the fat kid  That you know  Just gets romped 
[03:11:30]  On a daily basis  In this prison  School environment  If these are the worst  Of the worst though  I'll bet you  That this does actually  Keep a decent amount  Of that out of jail  Some of them  It probably just  It sinks in  And they  I bet  Oh man  You know you have  A rough job as a teacher  When like your  Third grade class  Needs security guards  Yeah yeah  Like there's a security force  Outside that room  Making sure that kid  Didn't get out that door  Chicago is a rough  Fucking place  They have little hurdles  Set up  Look at poor little 
[03:12:00]  N-Rock  Trying to jump over  The hurdles  He can't get over  The hurdles  He can't get over  The hurdles  They're off  He can get over it  They're literally  A foot off the ground  He's waiting for lunch  Poor little fat kid  Yeah  How long is this thing  It's five  I've watched five parts  Oh wow  I think there's  There's more coming out though  Right  There's like a sixth part  Somewhere  I'm not sure  I just saw five parts 
[03:12:30]  So I watched them all  Last night  They're all about  Ten minutes long  How does Vice  Get access to this stuff  I don't know  They just have  It really is  They must have  A good talker  That could go in there  And really spin  Why they need to do this  And they're very creative  With what the things  That they actually do shoot  Yeah  Yeah  I mean I'm always like  Perplexed  Like where do they  Find out about  That this school even exists  And then how do they  Convince the school  To let their cameras in  Yeah if you show up  At a school with cameras  And go like  Hey let me you know  Raising awareness  They'd be like  Get out of here  And how do they get 
[03:13:00]  The kids to not  Constantly just be  Fuck you  Doing the cameras  Yeah  They probably lost  A lot of footage  That kid  That kid's real bad  Is he  Yeah  That's my new bitch  He's  11  To hold the girl  He's like choking her  I'm about to spit on Chris  She spit on me  He was right there  And I went  And they came on me  It touched him a little bit  Yeah I'm playing my head  No  They got this girl  You know what a tough chick  She must be  Oh my god  The only Spanish girl 
[03:13:30]  She stabbed one kid  With a pencil  Yeah she's a problem  Because the kid said something  Oh the bus is  This is the bus ride  This is insanity  Who's filming this?  You're right  What?

[03:16:00]  I've never had the  This is  Here  Here's  Here's what I imagine  Like happening  Hello  Mr. Kumia  Yes  Hi  Your son Anthony  He stuck his middle finger up  At the gym teacher  And said  Go fuck yourself  Okay  Do you want to hold on  And hear the gunshots  So you can tell the gym teacher  That he is indeed dead  There's no way

[03:17:30]  On fire in his house  Accidentally  Okay  And he  He  Severely burnt  His two sisters  What  So  One sister was in a coma  And then she woke up  And they were saying  How  Her voice was all fucked up  When she woke up  And she talked  Exactly like that  So for some reason  Oh my  He's now speaking  Like his sister  Oh he's fucked up  He feels guilty  Yes  Did he do it on purpose  Or no  No he says it was by accident  But then he's like  I don't like talking about it  Because they didn't die 
[03:18:00]  And they're fine  And meanwhile  They're not fine  They showed like the burns  On their arms  They really  The sisters got fucked up  And then there's the moms  With the new baby  Just feeding the new baby  Because you know  She's doing so well  With these three  We're starting from scratch  Yeah yeah  Let's start over  With the unburned babies  Yeah this kid's fucked  Six months  Six months  This just started happening  Just randomly  Sometimes I feel lonely  Sometimes I feel lonely  Oh poor kid
