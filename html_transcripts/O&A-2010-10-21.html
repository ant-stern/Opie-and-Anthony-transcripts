<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous recap of the hosts' experience at a recent Yankees game.  They shared anecdotes, peppered with Chip Chipperson impressions, highlighting the exorbitant costs: $40 parking (during playoffs), $10 hot chocolate, $9 beer, $8 hot dogs, and premium "Legends seats" costing $1,500 per ticket, with season tickets reaching $192,000 for four seats.  This transitioned into a discussion of Bob Guccione's death and a news article linking oral sex to increased throat cancer in men.  This sparked a vulgar exchange about the risks of "secondhand pussy" and celebrities' sexual habits.  A call with Dr. Steve followed, focusing on the correlation between lifespan and cancer rates, soot's carcinogenic effects, and HPV transmission through oral sex.  The hosts then mentioned upcoming guests Patrice O'Neal and Nick DiPaolo and a planned rat discussion.

The show continued with a discussion about Blind Melon, their "one-hit wonder" status, and the impact of their lead singer's death, punctuated by profanity and criticisms of their music.  Studio guest Patrice O'Neal revealed a throat issue, leading to another humorous, albeit vulgar, discussion about cancer risks from oral sex.  Patrice detailed his raw food diet, describing bizarre dishes with much comedic exaggeration and profanity, including zucchini "lasagna" and mushroom "scallops."  Nick DiPaolo then joined the studio.  The conversation shifted to a comparison of the hosts' and DiPaolo's homes, again employing hyperbolic and profane descriptions, before concluding with a story about a past cookout.

A significant portion of the show focused on the hosts' frustrations with mortgage payments and their opinions on the NFL's "feminization."  Patrice O'Neal joined this discussion, which included offensive language and critiques of the rules changes, focusing on player safety, AstroTurf, steroids, and the increasing size and speed of players.  They also criticized breast cancer awareness campaigns and the presence of women on the sidelines.  The conversation veered into critiques of corporate culture and customer service, using highly offensive language, before promoting Nick DiPaolo's upcoming shows at Foxwoods.

The show featured a heated, vulgar discussion about perceived racial biases in television commercials, with examples cited and racial slurs employed throughout.  Opie, Anthony, Patrice O'Neal, and Nick DiPaolo engaged in a charged exchange about race, white liberals, "white guilt," and the alleged overrepresentation of Black people in advertising.  The conversation touched on politics (Obama, Sarah Palin, Bloomberg), Hollywood's perceived liberal agenda, and personal preferences regarding women of different races.  Nick DiPaolo's Foxwoods show was again promoted.

The final segment focused on the perceived attractiveness of Hollywood women, with vulgar and offensive comments about various actresses (Pam Anderson, Madeline Stowe, Queen Latifah, Scarlett Johansson, Vivica Fox, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Lena Horne),  their appearances, and perceived sexual orientations.  The discussion included speculation on Hollywood casting practices and a running gag about finding an "ugly" picture of Scarlett Johansson.  The show concluded with promotional information for Nick DiPaolo and Patrice O'Neal's shows and the hosts creating absurd and offensive titles for a fictional Nick DiPaolo comedy album.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal.  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio, satellite radio.  Apparently Opie and Anthony are dicks.  Oh, here they go again.  Fun, dopey radio show.  Not just any radio show.  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream.  The show is a lot funnier on any W.  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie here.  Auditorial team.  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us.  It's just astounding to me. 
[00:00:30]  I didn't want to say it's racist, but god damn.  This show will rock as best as we can possibly do this radio show.  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later.  There you go, all right?  Yeah, we just lost our demo, man.  What's wrong with you?  We're just a laugh draw for the walking radio duo.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:01:00]  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  Hi, folks.  Hi, folks.  The Yankees win.  The Yankees win.  Yes.  They needed me there at the stadium.  Yeah, how was the game, brother?  It was great.  Yeah?  We had a pisser.  Went with Keith and Ange.  Happy birthday, Ange.  It was her birthday.  And, of course, my date, Danny Ross.  Sweet boy.  Aw!  So, yeah, it was good. 
[00:01:30]  Great game.  Fun to watch.  Exciting.  Was that the first time you were at the new stadium?  No.  I've been there before.  Last year?  I think earlier this season and then last year.  It's a hell of a place to play baseball.  Yeah, it is.  It's unbelievable.  It's a really nice ballpark full of tradition and all of...  It was a fun game.  We were laughing a lot because there's no way we could stop doing Chip Chipperson impressions 
[00:02:00]  every time something happened.  There would be a foul ball that went the other way and I'd have to go like,  I almost got that one.  It was close.  I had it.  It was in my hand.  And just everything had to be Chip or Uncle Paul.  When I'm putting the happy birthdays up on the big screen for little kids.  It's had to be like, oh, gee, little Janet's a towel. 
[00:02:30]  We couldn't stop doing it.  See, I was at that stadium, though, but like four years, five years ago, it was nice.  That's the old stadium.  That's the new one.  No, the new one was just built like last, you know.  Yeah, right.  Whatever you got to tell yourself.  Yeah.  Whatever you got to tell yourself.  Yeah, it was fun.  We had a good time.  Yankees still alive.  It was nice to not have to watch Texas celebrate at the stadium.  That was good. 
[00:03:00]  Of course, they do have their work cut out for them.  I do understand this.  They are going back to Texas.  When do they play again?  Tomorrow?  Tomorrow, yes.  You think they're going to squeeze Lee in there or what?  Oh, yes.  Lee will be seen again, I'm sure.  But are they going to try to get him for game six?  No, you got to use him as your game seven guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's a game seven guy.  No, he's on too short a rest, I think, on six.  No, I know, but sometimes they squeeze that guy in.  They don't want to get jumpy.  They don't want to get jumpy like that.  I think they'll...  If they try to squeeze Lee into game six, then the Yankees are going to win the whole thing 
[00:03:30]  because that means Texas got a little nervous.  Look.  They should just chill out, let Lee rest that fucking arm.  They beat Texas before, I understand.  They've been beat up like fuck in the playoffs.  Hey, Yankees look good last night.  It's very difficult to come back from what they've done, but, you know, game by game, that's it.  How many hours was the game?  That's why I said last night.  I know it started in the afternoon, but when did you finally get out of the stadium, eight?  No, see, that's the thing.  When you go to a game with certain people, you don't park in the lot. 
[00:04:00]  I know a lot.  I'm saying, when did the game end?  We were home by 8.30.  That's not bad.  Yeah, yeah.  We were home by 8.30.  Game started at 4.  So, I mean, and we stayed till the end.  Right.  So, you know, it's one of those deals, but...  Did you go home after the show and then go to the game?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I went home.  I had to work out.  Yeah, that is how I'm trying to come over early, so I can get that done.  God, he increased the weights. 
[00:04:30]  That's good.  Fucking hurts, though.  I almost thought you were wearing more of those fake muscle suits.  I know.  It's crazy, isn't it?  It's crazy.  I'm huge.  Ant's muscles do pop.  Oh, it's annoying.  He looks very good.  I just want to poke his sore muscles right now.  I know.  My abs hurt.  Increased the weight on the crunches on the big ball.  I got the big ball in my gym.  I forgot the name of that ball.  And sometimes when he increases the weight, I get a little spastic and it rolls over on 
[00:05:00]  me and I capsize.  Do you?  I look stupid.  Like a little lamb.  I'm glad I'm not.  Yeah, it's like a little scared lamb.  My legs stick up in the air.  Like a fawn being born.  Yeah.  Yes, they just fall on the floor.  Jesus.  Good for the Yankees, though.  Yes.  My doorman's mad at me because I'm a Mets fan.  He's like, how could he not go for the Yankees now that the Mets are out?  I have this argument every fucking year because the Yankees are always in it.  I'm like, I can't do that.  Yeah, I know.  And I'm not a Phillies guy because I have a lot of family and friends down there. 
[00:05:30]  I'm not a Phillies guy.  I'm a Mets guy.  I'm a Mets guy.  Mets guy.  You know?  Yeah.  Kind of hoping the Rangers pull us out.  Say also greetings to a lot of fans last night.  A lot of fans.  Very good.  Coming up.  Saying hi.  Good to know they're still listening to this horse shit.  I know, right?  Great.  Now, the Yankees look good, though.  Yeah, they actually did.  Uh, CeCe got the job done, that fat fuck. 
[00:06:00]  He is just old school pitcher.  He's standing out there.  He, like, leans over.  His gut is hanging out.  He's scratching his balls.  It's like, that's a fucking old school pitcher.  I love the pitchers like him, CeCe.  Big gut fucking hanging over his belt.  After every pitch, he's got to tuck something back in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He just comes apart.  He's just always tucking something back in.  He lets that ball go.  Everything just comes apart on him.  It's just a mess.  He's grabbing his fucking shirt, pulling his leg, pant leg. 
[00:06:30]  He's got to adjust his jock strap.  He's got to tuck his shirt back in.  He's a slob.  I love it.  He's a slob.  Very good, man.  Yeah, good.  We had a nice back-to-back and a belly-to-belly.  See, I'm not a Phillies fan.  Oh, Giants did beat the Phillies.  Fuck.  The Giants beat the Phillies.  The Giants beat the Phillies.  The Giants beat the Phillies.  Did they?  It could be over for the Phillies tonight.  Yes, they face 6-5.  And Yankees, of course, 7-2 to force game six. 
[00:07:00]  Papers in New York.  Texas, hold it.  They're doing a little Texas hold'em joke in the paper today.  Texas hold it.  Texas hold it.  Turn it right.  I want it to be right.  There it is.  Yeah, Texas hold it.  Like hold'em.  But hey, hold it.  See, see ya in Texas.  Yeah.  I can't stand this.  He's almost like a black David Wells.  Yeah, yeah.  The way he's built with that gut. 
[00:07:30]  Oh, Wells was great, too.  He was the old school.  Wells was the slob out there.  A gut.  It always reminds me of the Bugs Bunny Gas House Gorillas episode.  Where, like, the pitcher was just that fat fuck sitting there all hunched over looking.  And then he pitched and fucking got his hanging out.  It's great.  A little known fact coming in from Mike in New York.  I did not know this.  Mike.  Mike.  Mike.  Morning, boys.  TC's got the biggest pants in baseball. 
[00:08:00]  Is that a fact?  True stat.  Yeah.  And how big are his pants?  No clue.  So this call was a complete waste.  Thank you, sir.  Yes.  I'm an image.  What do you think his waistline is if he has the biggest pants in baseball?  The biggest pants in baseball.  I'm guessing, like, 36, maybe?  36 inches?  Maybe.  I would have thought bigger.  45.  I'm huge.  Joe in Pennsylvania.  Joe.  Hey, boys.  I have another waste of a call.  I just wanted to tell you guys I had a pitch to somebody. 
[00:08:30]  Do you know it costs $40 to park at the stadium during the playoffs?  Does it?  What does it cost usually?  $23.  $23 is even too much.  What are they doing to us?  Making money.  I mean, I'll live down by...  Go ahead.  I live in...  Yeah, I was just going to say I'm annoyed because, you know, my sport is hockey, and  I'm annoyed that they went from $7 to $10 without even cleaning up the shitty parking lot.  They didn't even clean up the...  No.  After I had that rant, I really looked at the parking lot. 
[00:09:00]  There's grass growing out of it.  There's bolts and all sorts of fucking nails and shit.  Potholes.  You don't even know where your space is because the lines haven't been painted in years, but  they decide, well, we're just going to raise the price without cleaning up anything.  So I guess I shouldn't bitch at a $10 parking fee.  Well, it costs $10 to park for Phillies games.  I live down by Philadelphia.  Yeah.  It costs $23 for the Yankees regular season and $40 for the playoffs.  I spent $50 on my ticket, and the parking costs almost as much as the ticket. 
[00:09:30]  That's fucking ridiculous.  And that's before you even try to have a beer and maybe a little food, right?  Did you look at the prices, Anthony, yesterday?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It was pretty funny.  We were laughing at the $10 hot chocolate.  $10 for hot chocolate?  $10 for hot chocolate.  $9 for a bottle of beer.  $9 for a beer.  Double cheeseburgers, $12.  $12.  What were hot dogs?  You remember?  They had to be $8.  Yeah, like $8.  $8 for a hot dog.  It's just crazy. 
[00:10:00]  Every time the vendor would come around, and we got four people there, you're breaking  out a $100 bill.  I was pulling $100 out of my pocket, and it's like, yeah, okay, take care of that.  Well, you got to use your credit card at baseball games.  You never had to do that.  You would have a little pocket money for the game.  Yeah, yeah.  A little pocket money.  Not anymore.  Every trip to the stadium is $100 a person.  You know what?  At least.  I was telling Anthony, it's crazy.  When we were growing up, you know, you paid, you didn't feel like you were breaking the 
[00:10:30]  bank to go to a baseball game.  And they have figured out how to just make it pretty much an investment.  If you want to go to a baseball game, it's a small investment.  It's going to cost you.  It's going to cost you.  Yeah.  Just to get in there, like you said, to park, and then you're paying for the food.  You're paying ridiculous prices for the food.  You never had to think about it when you went to a game as a kid or your parents brought  you to a game.  You never thought about it.  The dad would be like, yeah, yeah, hot dogs for everyone.  Yeah, sodas, yeah, no problem. 
[00:11:00]  Now you're looking at the menu and figuring out which kid doesn't need to eat or if they  could split a hot dog or split a soda.  And I bet you the next area that goes up is the parking.  I think they're going to figure out how to just kill you with parking.  I mean, kill you.  They really are at this point.  And then they'll have something like, well, you know, carpool to the game.  But I'm starting to think they're going to just get a $40, $50 parking fee going for regular  games like hockey, baseball, that type of thing. 
[00:11:30]  I know football, they're starting to push that way already because they say, look, there's  not many games, so it's more of an event.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's where they're going to kill you next, I'm telling you, because they can't  kill you in the stadium anymore.  They could still kill you with the food.  How?  $10 for a hot chocolate.  Check it up.  I ate 10 bucks a beer.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to not drink at the ball game?  Right.  By the time we were done, underneath us was crazy.  Like, Danny was even saying, they should have, like, when you're on a plane, you know how 
[00:12:00]  the flight attendant will come through and take some of your shit?  Like, they should have somebody like that.  Sure.  Just hire somebody to kind of go, hey, let me take some of your shit when you're getting  some new shit.  Just do a quick sweep.  You're fucking standing.  We were standing on a garbage dump of food containers and just beer bottles all over the  fucking place.  1,200 calorie peanuts.  Peanuts.  Yeah.  1,200 calories.  They put the calories on everything now?  Yeah.  Even at the stands, you walk up and you see, like, peanuts, 1,200 calories for a bag of 
[00:12:30]  peanuts.  Why do that?  I shan't be getting those.  I love the Bloomberg.  It's the one thing Bloomberg did that I like.  I hate it.  No, but now.  Because we know what's bad for us.  But no, you can't.  Now, like, fatties can't complain.  It's like, it's right.  It's like, I don't order stuff that I would have ordered.  I'm like, I didn't realize that was that.  I wasn't going to.  I would not get 1,200 calorie peanuts.  But if I didn't know.  Yeah.  I might get them.  It's good calories, though, right?  It's the good fat.  It's the good fat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't they say that?  Hey, Ann, so you probably paid everyone's way because it was Ange's birthday and you're 
[00:13:00]  probably treated, right?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I do.  So how much did it cost you for four people?  I have no idea.  About?  Keith bought everything.  How many beers?  Wow.  I can't even count between me and Danny.  Let me think.  And then it was Ange's birthday, so she was drinking.  I'm just trying to figure out.  Keith doesn't like beer, so he only had, like, two or so.  So I'm just trying to figure out a number for four people to go to a baseball game.  I had to have had.  Let me see.  One.  When I first got in.  Yeah.  Two.  Eight.  One.  I probably had seven.  Seven beers? 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Nine bucks a piece?  Yeah, I think Danny's probably the same.  Plus tip?  That's seven.  And then nine, ten.  Hold on.  Eleven.  Probably 13 beers between all of us.  So that's 90 plus, about 117 bucks probably, plus tip, obviously.  Plus food.  And then food, so we all had, you know, a couple of hot dogs each.  Taking, like, 50 bucks.  Some fries and shit like that.  I had a nice fucking $8 pretzel or whatever the fuck that thing cost.  So that's only a couple hundred bucks for four people.  Yeah. 
[00:14:00]  You know.  And that's a good day at the ballpark.  It's a playoff game.  I mean.  That's not too bad.  Yeah.  Florentine tweeted, sorry about it.  He's like, he goes, it's nice to see some empty seats at Yankee Stadium.  That's what you get for $1,200 bucks for a fucking playoff ticket.  Come on.  Yeah, yeah.  It's sickening.  So that's silly.  Is that for just a regular seat, not the special seats, obviously, down below?  I don't know, honestly.  Which are empty half the time because, you know, it's the big corporate guys that buy  those seats.  The ones where they have the VIP treatment, give you whatever the hell you want.  Except for booze, I hear. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, what?  Those special seats way down below.  Right.  I mean, the playoffs, I'm sure they were packed, but a regular Yankees game, there's not a  lot of people down in those seats.  No.  And I forgot what the price is.  It's a ridiculous price, but it's VIP treatment, five-star restaurant-type service and food.  I need those seats for next season.  But they don't include the booze.  No?  And the number for the seats, somebody, a big Yankees fan, has to help us out.  Jim said $1,250 for a champion. 
[00:15:00]  Does he empty seats at Yankees?  I think $1,250 for regular seats.  Just the basic.  Not those.  I forgot what they're called down below.  Someone will help us out.  Yeah, clubhouse seats.  Clubhouse seats or something.  They're thousands of dollars just for a regular game.  And no one's going.  And what they basically tell you is like, yeah, it's whatever the price is, but you get  everything.  No one's going.  No one's going to get that price.  Like what?  What do you get?  Below jobs.  You get five-star restaurant food, like a buffet and white club service. 
[00:15:30]  I don't know what you get.  It's silly at a ball game.  It's just silly.  It's like how spoiled do people need to be?  Stay home.  Stay home.  Watch it on a nice big TV and fucking have a cook come over and do it.  What the fuck are you going to the game for?  Yeah.  Like people, they give me shit all the time.  Think a fancy man would have fancier seats than that.  They were good.  I had good seats.  Good, solid seats, right?  They were good seats, man.  I wasn't up in the fucking boonies up there.  I was further down than Midway. 
[00:16:00]  I saw your tweet, whatever it was.  It was a picture.  Tweets are very deceiving.  It was not bad.  Pictures.  Pictures of ballparks are very deceiving because the seats were much better than the pictures  portrayed.  I was able to see everything.  We were calling fucking balls and strikes from a weird angle.  Well, that's crazy.  It's crazy.  That's crazy.  But you could tell.  Then why can't the umps tell?  They're right there.  I don't know.  That is weird.  I don't know.  That is weird.  Let's say hi to Greg in D.C.  Greg?  Good morning, boys. 
[00:16:30]  Good morning.  Yeah, those are good guys.  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know that the news station down here that you actually  highlighted on October a couple of years ago played John Sterling's douchey  Grandy Man can call.  Oh, the Grandy Man can.  The Grandy Man can.  Granderson.  Oh, the Grandy Man.  That was almost exactly the call.  Oh, it's horrible.  It doesn't change.  Mm-hmm.  Well, after they played it, the two guys started bantering back and forth about how Harry  Carey was known to imbibe and have a few beverages during games. 
[00:17:00]  I guess that's what John Sterling's doing, too.  Oh, they're basically saying he's a drunk?  He's drinking?  We don't know that.  He's implying that Sterling gets drunk during games, which is why he makes those dumbass  calls.  Knowing how wimpy sports is becoming?  Not the players, by the way.  The players want to be doing all that horse shit.  I would doubt that he's able to even sneak a beer as he's broadcasting.  His window is open to the world, too.  That old school shit is long gone, man.  I don't think you got the announcers drinking. 
[00:17:30]  And then his little partner there, what's her name?  Susan Waldman.  Susan Waldman.  The funniest fucking thing about the game last night was I go to take a piss.  I go to take a piss in the beautiful Yankee Stadium bathroom that could handle so many  cocks.  That bathroom can handle a lot of dicks, my friend.  That line is moving.  That line is moving.  One thing I don't like about that setup that they have there, while it is nice.  They don't have those annoying blockades in between the urinals.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  No, they don't. 
[00:18:00]  Well, you could peer over and...  Like, at least at, like, Citi Field or even before that, Shay, like, you would wait.  Like, the line would be outside of the bathroom.  And then as people finished up, the line would move inside.  You go in?  Well, yeah.  You say it was a little different because I guess there's more room in the bathroom.  Yes.  So, you just, there's people at urinals and then there's, like, three people waiting  behind the person pissing.  Behind the guy.  You pick a urinal and get in line.  And it's on each side.  It's like you're ready to deploy for some military operation.  Like you're ready to jump out of a plane.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I don't want to stand there, like, right behind, like, I'm a foot away from your ass. 
[00:18:30]  A guy who's pissing.  And, you know, and this guy's just holding his cock pissing.  I'm just waiting for him to finish.  Holding his cock.  It's so awkward.  I'm jealous because Nassau Coliseum can't handle so many cocks.  Nah, not as many dicks.  They can't handle as many cocks as Yankee Stadium there.  The line out the door, like, just moves like a little conga line.  It keeps going, goes right in.  People coming out.  I think Nassau Coliseum has maybe four bathrooms for the guys.  Maybe.  No shit.  Maybe.  Fucking assholes.  You've got to miss half a period.  That makes sense to fucking take a leak. 
[00:19:00]  Get a new stadium!  They got the 88 CBS feed going in the bathroom, I gather.  Oh, that would be nice.  We don't even have that in Nassau Coliseum.  So they got that.  So I'm taking a leak, and they go to Susan Waldman, and the second her voice hit the speakers,  the whole fucking bathroom just goes, shut up, cunt, you fucking bitch!  What are you talking about?  Fuck this horn!  Fuck you bitch!  Was that just you, or just...  No, the whole place just goes fucking crazy.  Like, the bathrooms, apparently, they all go bullshit when her voice comes over the fucking system. 
[00:19:30]  See, Nassau Coliseum, they can at least do that.  If we're going to wait forever to fucking take a leak, get some audio or a TV in the bathroom.  You want to know what's going on with the fucking game?  How hard is that?  God, that's all you need.  By the way, guys, one other thing I wanted to let you know, Major League Baseball decides the cost of tickets to all playoff games for all teams.  MLB decides that.  Oh, really?  Yes.  For the tickets for the playoff games, MLB tells the stadium and the team how much they can charge for their game. 
[00:20:00]  How many people, though, are buying the tickets from the stadium?  Or they're buying them from StubHub, or they're buying them from a fucking scalper, or they're buying...  Like, I don't know how...  I don't think I know one person that bought the ticket from the stadium.  Because we have jobs.  Yeah.  We don't have time to wait in line for whatever it would be.  You go online, you buy an over-inflated price ticket, and you go to the fucking game.  Right.  It's pretty much your only choice.  That's what the average person's doing, right? 
[00:20:30]  Yep.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you, boys.  This guy's going to help me out.  Pete in Connecticut.  So they're called the legend seats at Yankee Stadium.  Oh, legend seats.  Yeah, they're legend seats, like for Legends Clubhouse.  It was $1,500 per ticket, face value.  We had a family of four.  It would have been $6,000 to watch the game, and you still got to pay for your alcohol.  Yeah, but they give you a...  Yeah, the kids had a blast.  All you do is you pick up a little flyer, like a little green card, and they give you 
[00:21:00]  whatever you want.  Ice cream, peanuts, pretzels, everything.  Right.  Yeah, for six grand.  But if you're paying $1,500 a seat, you got to throw the booze in there.  Yeah, what the fuck?  And maybe you cut off people after a while.  Maybe you tell them the first five is on us, and then after that, I don't know, something.  There's just things that say, it says $6,000 to watch a fucking baseball game.  Dude, I'm telling you, this is what the Yankees have done.  I know.  And when I went to a game in the middle of the summer there, I mean, how many rows is it, 
[00:21:30]  Pete?  Is it about 10 rows?  No, it's more than that.  It's a whole section.  It's more than 10 rows.  And it's right behind home plate and stretches out almost to the first and third base, right?  Almost dugout to dugout to the beginning.  Dugout to dugout.  Okay, right.  Yeah, when I went to a game, the place was packed, except that whole area was almost empty.  Empty.  Because it was a regular game.  Who's paying $1,500 to see a regular game?  The legend seats.  We didn't get them for free.  I wouldn't have been sitting there either.  For the older listeners, could you imagine growing up that someday you would pay $1,500 
[00:22:00]  for a regular game?  It's fucking gross.  There's a black president.  Let's get over that first.  And the fact they stick it in plain view like that, I don't mind the luxury boxes being something,  but right there, it's like, what a fucking faggot.  It's stupid.  Who wants to pay that much to watch a...  It's stupid.  Stay home.  Yeah, they don't.  Like Ian said.  They don't care if it looks empty because they figure, look, if a couple hundred people  do it out of $1,000 or whatever it would be, they're making a shitload of money instead 
[00:22:30]  of paying just a regular price for those seats.  So it's unbelievable.  We talked about it.  I mean, they want baseball games four hours long now because there's so much to do at  the stadium, too.  Yeah.  You could take an hour and walk around Yankee Stadium because there's so much to see.  So could you like to see the museum?  Right.  Would you like to go to Legend Park, the little fucking park?  And then you go back to your seat and you don't really feel like you missed that much  of the game.  Monument Park and go to this and...  The museum, right?  The Hard Rock.  You could go to the Hard Rock. 
[00:23:00]  You could eat at the Steakhouse.  And what is in Centifield?  I don't want to mess up the plug here.  The Mohegan...  It is Mohegan.  Okay.  Yeah.  Mohegan little bar area thingy.  But no gambling.  No.  You just hang out and drink and check it out.  It's a nice journey.  Very pricey, though.  I remember when I was a younger man, we'd go to Abbott's Field.  Abbott's Field.  Cost $6 for a ball game.  See, you could afford to take the kids at that price. 
[00:23:30]  Sure you could.  Gather a bunch of them up in the neighborhood, take them to the ball game.  Yeah.  They liked that Uncle Paul.  They did.  They always had...  I would load them full of soda.  Then you'd have to take them to the restroom.  Dad, you watch the ball game, I'm going to take Timothy.  Yeah, they can't go long.  And of course, you've got to take him into the stall because there's...  It's embarrassing for the boy.  You don't want the other people seeing his penis.  And the urinal's too high, so you've got to go to the stall to...  Yeah, you've got to hold him over there. 
[00:24:00]  Yeah, you hold him up right short.  They hover.  Just drips out of there.  Oh, God.  You've got to pat his bottom to drip it all out of there.  Get out of there.  Fucking Uncle, I'm out.  Why?  What do you want it to do?  Stay in there?  Get it all out of there.  Well, of course.  That's got to get all out of there.  Yeah.  Yeah, you've got to make sure that there's none in the underpants.  His mother's going to have to do laundry.  Clean it good.  You are a creep, Uncle Paul. 
[00:24:30]  I try to go with the Uncle Paul bit, and there's always something that Uncle Paul says.  I took Danny when he was younger.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he always had that plump behind.  The bubble butt.  Yeah.  A lot to smack to get all the drips out.  Yeah, he always had little hair on his bottom, little peach fuzz.  I used to tease him.  Give a spot on the smack. 
[00:25:00]  We'll all leak out of there.  That's just fucking disgusting.  It really is.  Let's say maybe other things are disgusting.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Oh, sorry to say it's disgusting, Uncle Paul.  It really gets upset.  Find your business.  Let's see.  All right.  A lot of parking fucking phone calls.  Right.  I know, whatever.  Okay.  $192,000 for a season ticket and those seats. 
[00:25:30]  Get the fuck out.  Come on, let's go.  All right, now we've got to go.  I hope they have balloons of shit and piss thrown at them.  If you spend that much for a baseball ticket, you're a cunt.  Yeah, because you're ruining it for everybody else.  Because if you're willing to pay that, then they have no problem trying to take more money  out of our pockets.  That's $192,000.  Sir, is that true?  $192,000 for season tickets?  Thank you.  Joe. 
[00:26:00]  It's for four tickets.  Four tickets down there in those Legends seats.  $192,000.  And how many games is that at home?  80-something?  I think it's just for a regular season.  I don't even know if that's for playoffs.  Not even include playoffs.  You get everything you want.  That should include flying on the fucking team plane to the away games and getting the  same seats at the other stadium.  He goes, but you get everything.  You don't get booze.  That's important to a lot of people.  Everything but the booze.  And a mixed drink is $14.  $14 after you paid that much for the seats? 
[00:26:30]  For that price, I want tits in my face.  I want a lap dance.  I want a fucking vagina rubbing against a hard dick.  Whatever.  I'm sorry, $192,000.  Yeah.  Divided by 82.  82 games.  Is $2,341.  Whatever, $2,400 a game.  $2,350 a game.  Divided by four. 
[00:27:00]  Four seats.  Equals $5.85 a game.  When you break it down like that.  Did I do math wrong?  No.  It probably is because you're buying a season ticket instead of just one ticket at a time.  $5,85 a game, which is a lot of money, but that's...  They double that fucking shit if you buy a single ticket.  If you buy the season ticket, they're going to give you some kind of a deal.  You're going to spend that much money on the food anyway, so...  Yeah.  So it probably adds up.  Yeah.  That's $5,85 a game.  It's a lot, but it's not what I thought.  But I don't know. 
[00:27:30]  That doesn't make sense.  Yeah.  Buy four tickets, though.  Because he's saying if you're four tickets, 82 games, $2,400 a game, roughly.  Right.  So just under $600, like you're saying?  Yeah.  It's a lot of money.  But I mean...  That's a lot of fucking money.  But if you're...  $600 per seat.  You're still parking.  You're still tipping the waitresses.  Oh, yeah.  You're still buying merchandise.  If you're like...  Let's just say...  What's the dream job?  The CEO of Shell.  Right.  He doesn't mind.  Plus, let's not forget, I mean, you know, people are buying alcohol, too. 
[00:28:00]  That has to add up after 80 games.  If it's $14 a mixed drink.  It's a lot of money for a drink.  Yeah, you're having more than one mixed drink.  I like a virgin pina colada.  Keep your wits about you.  Get away from me!  Who's this little fat boy?  One of the Addams Family children.  Get away from me.  You're okay and you're spooky.  All right, mysterious.  Don't step on my feet.  Why do you get nervous when children are around? 
[00:28:30]  He's like a man, baby.  I don't like that guy.  He really is.  You pull his pants off and his hair down there.  Deceitful.  Like Bob Kelly.  Deceitful.  All right, enough about baseball.  So, there you go.  Your Yankees are still in it.  Still in a clinging...  Filly's looking not too good right now.  Do we have any baseball?  Oh, we do have baseball tonight.  Okay, Giants-Phillies played tonight. 
[00:29:00]  And late last night, we learned that Mr. Guccione passed.  Yeah.  Bob Guccione at the age of 79.  I didn't know he was suffering from cancer.  Oh, he had tongue cancer, I think, at one point.  I had no idea.  Died in Dallas, Texas.  Died in Dallas, Texas.  How ironic.  Tongue cancer.  What kind of gas was he fucking licking for 45, 50 fucking years?  Not so ironic.  Remember a good old stunt brain on his Twitter yesterday?  No, he's fine.  He tweeted a story about fucking throat cancer and mouth cancer due to oral sex. 
[00:29:30]  Big article yesterday.  On whose part?  I didn't want to know.  Oh, my God.  I didn't want to know.  Wow.  Yeah, if we could find that article, it was Stuntbrain's Twitter.  What's Roger Ebert been eating?  Fucking Martian pussy?  But Guccione, 79.  That's like a big thing for our generation. 
[00:30:00]  There it is.  That's all we had.  Oral sex linked to rising men's throat cancer.  What?  What are they, smoking out of their pussies?  You damn bitches.  We try to help you.  Women are giving us throat cancer?  For years now, doctors have urged young women to be vaccinated against the, this thing,  the human populum virus, HPV, which is believed to cause cervical cancer.  And isn't that the only cancer you could actually spread?  Yeah.  How is that possible?  Because you could spread the HPV, which then turns it into cancer, turns it into cervical 
[00:30:30]  cancer.  Yeah.  So it's not literally.  But now growing research in Europe and the United States is implicating HPV in a rising  number of cases of head and neck cancers in men.  And many doctors are recommending that all boys be vaccinated as well.  Holy shit.  We're getting, someone is telling us, just don't have any fun out there.  Wow.  There is a God.  He doesn't, he doesn't want us.  What about secondhand pussy? 
[00:31:00]  Secondhand pussy.  Is that dangerous?  Very good question, Amph.  Is that dangerous?  If your friend is licking pussy and you're just sitting around, can, can that get in the  air and maybe hurt you?  Like, what if I eat some vagina and then I share a soda with a pal?  Right.  That could be a problem.  That's secondhand pussy by proxy.  The alcohol in the soda that you two are sharing will probably kill anything.  Yeah, that's true.  Like taking a nice sip of booze in between laps.  Doctors say that changing sexual behaviors, earlier sex, more partners, and especially 
[00:31:30]  oral sex are contributing to a new epidemic of, oh no, of, uh, orf, uh, orf, uh, wow, that's  a biggie.  Orf, orf.  Come on, get it out.  I don't know that word.  I think I know.  I am not even going to fucking fake it.  I have no idea.  Come on, big A.  Orf, or, come on, Jimmy, you don't even know that one.  And you're smart.  See, look, he's studying that word.  I can't hold it. 
[00:32:00]  That's a, that's a tongue twister.  Orf, orf, orf, orf.  But you've got to squeeze that R in.  I don't think you squeeze the R in.  Orf, orf, orf, orf, orf, orf, orf, orf, orf.  Orfaringil.  Good job, Derek.  I'd have you back on the board, sir.  Orfaringil.  I think Jimmy's right.  Orfaringil.  Exactly.  By the way.  Exactly.  Derek.  Yes.  Exactly.  Yes.  Yes.  D-boy is the shit.  What's the R, though?  And a piece of shit.  Oh, he's garbage personified. 
[00:32:30]  Say it again, Jimmy.  Are you getting the R in there?  I'm guessing it's orfaringil.  Orfaringil.  Orringil, yeah.  All right.  Orfaringil.  Orfaringil.  All right.  The next word's...  That's easy.  Orfaringil squamous.  Squamous.  Cell cancers.  Those are the throat, tonsils, and base of the tongue.  All right.  I don't want that.  I wonder if Michael Douglas' cancer is associated with a little oral sex.  Holy shit.  He said he was a sex addict at one point in his life.  He did.  He did, huh?  Maybe he liked...  What about...  These cancers can be deadly. 
[00:33:00]  No shit.  And are striking men at a younger age and increasing numbers.  Well, let's get through the throat cancer.  What about eating the ass?  I don't think there's human HPV in the ass.  Are you trying to say that eating ass is...  Safer than...  Safer than...  Safer than...  Safer than...  Safer than...  You heard it here on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'm proclaiming.  There's a lag in information, said Dr. John Deacon.  Why is their name always associated with what they're talking about when it's doctors?  Doctor.  Deacon.  A medical...  Oncologist. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you.  At Georgetown University.  See, we physicians have done a poor job of advertising the fact that boys and girls  should have the vaccine.  Because boys and girls, not men and women, you...  So what?  What?  We're fucked?  We're too old to be vaccinated at a certain age.  You've had too much sexual exposure.  Oh, no.  We're fucked.  Fuck.  What are they going to vaccinate me with at this point?  Oh, really?  Kerosene?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  You're like the vaccine, though.  They should take your blood and use it like fucking...  You know what? 
[00:34:00]  Because of Jimmy...  Like Omega Man.  I don't know if I have cancer or not.  Who knows?  I could be a giant tumor at this point.  You'll look it.  Why would I think that that would just be a statement I'd make safely and comfortably?  You're amongst friends.  You're amongst friends, Ricky.  Slice those wrists again.  I saw Jimmy once gargle with...  What is it?  The...  Come.  Before liquid shit.  What happened to gargle with?  Let's all just get them out of the way.  What was the shit that made your whole mouth foam? 
[00:34:30]  Oh, that was...  Oh, God, yeah.  It makes you...  Peroxide.  It hurts your peroxide.  It hurts your filling sometimes if you've gargled too hard with pure peroxide.  I used to.  Wow.  I tried once and I thought I was a fucking rabid dog.  It's terrible.  Mad dog!  Mad dog!  Try it sometime.  If you've got shit going on in your mouth, fuck, it cleans up everything.  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  I read something about cancer, by the way.  It said that we...  They didn't have any in ancient Egypt.  Like, they can't find any in Neanderthal. 
[00:35:00]  It's like there's something about the Industrial Revolution that may have brought it on.  They don't find it in all bodies.  What do you think?  They were eating fucking healthy shit and they weren't throwing smoke in the air.  But their bones, what if they got it from, you know, in their liver?  Very few cases.  Do you think cancer is like a man-made thing?  I think it is.  Don't even...  Why would you even bring this question up?  It was invented by the government.  Cancer is a government-invented disease. 
[00:35:30]  I know.  I was a fighter.  A Navy SEAL.  What else was I?  Uh...  Uh...  I don't know.  A governor!  Wait, a former governor!  They won't even let me in the hospital to look at an oxygen tent with a patient in it  while I smoke a cigarette and do some welding.  A conspiracy?  You believe your own government.  I'm not gonna.  What?  What? 
[00:36:00]  Moron!  They might not have had cancer, but they were dying in horrific ways.  Oh, yeah.  They're like 25 years old.  Yeah, I think we balanced it out.  A woolly mammoth just takes you away one day.  Yeah, yeah.  You know.  Take a little of the big C if you don't die from the scarlet fever these days.  Sure.  Yeah.  But it's amazing.  They said, like, in...  They found, like, one case in the Neanderthals, and they said that that tissue would survive  better than a lot of skin tissue in mummies.  Oh, yeah?  Very few.  And back then, they had no fucking microbiology, so it's amazing that they weren't all dying 
[00:36:30]  of it.  So why don't we get Dr. Steve on the phone?  Maybe there would be mummified tumors, are you saying?  Like that?  They would somehow...  I didn't know medically how they would know, but they're saying that they started...  And nobody wrote about it.  Yeah.  The doctors back then would have written about something, but they said it started to be  written about, like, the 1700s.  There were cases of nasal cancer from snuff, and your ball cancer, chimney sweeps, were  getting ball cancer.  Chimney sweeps?  In, like, the 1700s.  Yeah.  What?  Chimney, chimney, chimney, chimney, chimney, chimney, chimney, rule. 
[00:37:00]  My balls feel like...  I only have one ball where I had had two.  Chim chimney, chimney, chimney, chimney, chimney, rule.  Uh, now there's dust shooting where there once was goo.  A long way.  That's a good one.  Chim chimney.  Oh, Chim.  The Chim chimney sweep.  That's a terrible song.  It's awful.  It's from Mary Poppins, I think.  Is it?  Yeah, I think it is.  I think you're right.  Oh.  Yeah, the chimney sweep.  Wait, the chimney... 
[00:37:30]  Go ahead, sorry.  No, no, the, uh...  I was going to be saying about a spoonful of AIDS blood.  Believe me, I was going nowhere smart with that.  Makes the jism go down.  What do you mean the chimney sweep was getting ball kicks?  That's where cancer was, like...  Why in the balls?  Don't know.  I can understand maybe lung cancer.  Don't know.  But maybe whatever they were breathing in, just...  Breathing in.  It was good for testicle cancer.  Maybe they were using their ball bag to scrub the chimneys.  Yeah, at the particularly tough spots, they would use the folds of the scrotum to force it in. 
[00:38:00]  Get a good cleaning going.  How do you not know being a chimney sweep is going to be a problem?  Dude, greatest job ever.  You don't even know if the person did a good job for you.  That's true.  Just hang out and get a little fucking soot on you and say, all right, good to go.  You have a little can of soot.  You pat it on your cheeks.  Right.  You're ready to go, mate.  I'd love to ask Dr. Steve about that, though, because...  And I curse me.  Yeah, the mummies were a little different.  Oh, back then they had... 
[00:38:30]  Oh, different things killing them.  I mean, it was...  They'd wrap you up.  He throws a joke in sometimes, you know, your mummy, you're going to call your daddy.  Tumor and a viscous fluid buildup.  Viscous.  Yeah, it's a buildup.  It's like a fatty tissue.  That's what I am.  Where were we that we ended up on oral sex causing cancer?  In the men's room?  Was it the men's room?  What the fuck?  Who were we talking about?  And then I said, oh, Stunt Brain tweeted. 
[00:39:00]  Yes.  What was it?  I don't remember.  Guccione dying.  Oh, Guccione?  Yeah.  Yeah, see, the listeners were always paying attention.  You said he had throat cancer or mouth cancer.  Yeah, and said he must have eaten some bad pussy.  Oh, right, Guccione.  And then the whole thing.  Were you a fan of Guccione stuff?  Yeah, early on as a kid, I would take Penthouse over Playboy any fucking day.  All I needed was Playboy.  Penthouse had...  It was more sexual.  Playboy was just the chicks kind of standing there. 
[00:39:30]  And that was cool.  But Penthouse was a little skankier.  They showed the pink.  A little pink.  They opened it up.  Yes.  They opened it up a little bit for you.  Yes.  By the way, back in Victorian times, part of the Chimney Sweep's job description was  to go naked into smaller chimneys.  I guess the clothes would...  Oh, I see.  Yeah, kind of hurt them.  Yeah, it said after doing a lifetime of that kind of work, it would lead to what they called  Chimney Sweep's cancer.  Oh, my God.  And they said that there would be a malignant sore referred to as a soot wart. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, soot wart.  And it would spread like a tiny, crusty army.  A tiny, crusty army.  What the fuck?  They didn't really have a whole lot of, you know, medicine back in the day, so they would  just cut off the affected area.  Whatever had a problem, they just saw off.  That's pretty much it.  Shugga, shugga, shugga, shugga.  Oldie time medicine was pretty much a hacksaw.  All right, we got Dr. Steve.  Now, Dr. Steve, Jimmy's got something great for you today, really.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  Dr. Steve?  Yes.  Hi, I was reading that there was a cancer. 
[00:40:30]  They said they don't have many cases going back to ancient Egypt or Neanderthals.  They didn't find many cases of it.  So they're saying it's not in a conspiracy way, but maybe our lifestyles have changed after  the Industrial Revolution.  Is that true or is that a bunch of hogwash?  Excuse my language.  True, but I believe that it has more to do with age, yeah, lifespan.  Oh, but the guy poo-pooed that, but go ahead. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, he did poo-poo it.  Yeah, excuse me again.  I don't mean to be so aggressive.  Technical jargon.  What do you think, though?  Yeah, I mean, our lifespan is longer than it's ever been now, and, you know, if you don't  die of heart disease, you're probably going to die of cancer.  That's wonderful, Dr. Steve.  Mr. Joy.  That should be hanging in your office when people walk in.  Yeah, right next to the diploma. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, one of these things is going to kill you.  That's wonderful.  You know, think about it.  I mean, but...  We don't want to.  What's third on the list, sir?  There is some evidence that if you are at low risk for heart disease, that you are at  increased risk for cancer, and that's just because you've got to die of something.  What's third?  It's like stroke or something?  Rape to death by black orderly in the senior citizen's home.  It's the lucky way to go.  Do you know what third is for the trifecta? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, yeah.  Well, you know, heart disease and, you know, heart attacks and stroke.  Yeah, it's pretty much the same category, right?  Right, right, right.  So what is third behind heart disease and cancer?  Golly.  You know, accidental death is up there.  Oh, well, you can always hope for that.  Yeah, you can always hope that you're walking one time and maybe a truck backs over your foot.  You know, and then by pushing down, there's a fluid buildup of some sort. 
[00:42:30]  And it causes a problem for you.  Jimmy's doctor, Steve, always has problems with fluid buildups.  Yeah, fluid buildup.  It's very viscous.  Listen, it begins to be leaking and secreting leakage.  Sputum.  You get a lot of sputum.  Sputum.  Dr. Steve's a huge fucking sputum fan.  Fan of the sputum, are you?  I sold shirts that say sputum rules and he's the only one that bought it.  Yeah, I think he makes up words.  I really do.  Because we can't challenge him on some of these big words.  But he makes a great point. 
[00:43:00]  As people get older, and back then, I'm sure there was a lot more accidental deaths than there are now.  And death from infection.  So you just didn't live long enough to get the cancer.  Hey, we also are learning about, what was it, Danny?  Soot warts?  Or soot?  Soot warts from chimney sweeps.  From Harry Potter.  Getting ball cancer.  Harry Potter.  How do you get cancer from chimney sweeping naked there, Dr. Steve?  Yeah, apparently soot was a carcinogen. 
[00:43:30]  You know, charred food is felt to be, you know, it can lead to cancer as well.  There's these things called nitrosamines.  Oh, great.  Nitrosamines.  Throw your barbecues away.  Great.  We can't even barbecue now?  No, you can.  You can, but it's just repeated exposure over and over again is thought to be somewhat toxic.  Anything in moderation, right?  That's right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  And what about now this finding that the HPV that women get on their cervix can now affect 
[00:44:00]  men and give them tongue and throat cancers if they're digging in deep and eating a lot  of pussy?  Yeah, there's some increased risk of oral cancer from contracting HPV.  That's why you don't see black guys walking around like fucking Ebert, because they don't  eat a coochie unless it's fried.  How do you get checked for that? 
[00:44:30]  I've eaten a lot of pussy.  Yeah, Dr. Steve, what do we do?  God damn it.  What's the first sign?  The way women get checked for it, of course, is by getting a pap smear.  And I don't know that there's any screening test for the throat.  Well, well, can I jump in here?  Yeah, well, the dentist always takes a look in there and always says everything looks good.  Right.  And I know he's sort of looking for some...  He's putting his dick in your mouth when you're fucking under.  Yeah, but you can look at a cervix and not see the HPV, though. 
[00:45:00]  That's why they have to do the pap smear, where they actually go ahead and scrape the  thing.  Look at cells.  You know, I don't see why, if you thought you were at risk, that they couldn't go in  and scrape your tonsils and do an HPV test on it.  I've just never heard of doing that.  I've never heard of that either.  Yeah, so the dentist taking a look in there and saying everything looks okay when you  get your checkup doesn't mean shit.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  It's okay on a macroscopic level, but what you're wanting to look for is, you know, 
[00:45:30]  sub-microscopic particles that are in there that are causing a, you know, a microscopic  effect that you can't see.  Because if you wait until the things, you know, are causing...  There's a big globby tumor there.  You're weighted tumor.  Oh, shit.  I'll...  You know what?  I will...  I can't...  I live out in the country, and my internet connection sucks, and so I was going to try  to look that up while I was talking to you, but I'll find out about that.  Yeah, we know you make up half this shit on the fly.  We understand. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  Oh.  You call me up and ask me statistics at whatever time in the morning it is.  It's early.  It's early.  It's getting rambunctious.  I was dreaming that I was Dr. Steve Kevorkin.  That's what I dream of.  That's what I dream of.  It's a nightmare.  Oh.  Wow.  That's frightening.  Should we put a moratorium on pussy eating?  No, I don't think so.  From what I remember, we did a little story on this on Weird Medicine about a year ago. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, look at you ahead of the time.  Yeah.  Can we do a clinical study?  As I remember, the risk was low.  I mean, it was felt to be tangible, but low.  Low, but tangible.  Yes.  All right, sir.  More dangerous than smoking cigarettes?  No.  No, no, no.  All right.  All right.  What if she's smoking cigarettes in her vagina and then you, well, forget it.  Okay.  Dr. Steve, again, very informative. 
[00:47:00]  Thank you so much.  Thanks, boys.  All right, Dr. Steve.  Go back to sleep.  Yep.  Thanks a lot.  Take care.  We're going to take a break.  My internet connection is no good.  Tangible.  Yeah.  It's a tangible threat.  It's not exactly.  Yeah.  Just don't eat the pussy.  Yeah.  It's not saying you can't enjoy oral sex, but don't think you're safe.  Just don't go so deep with your tongue.  Yeah.  Don't touch cervix.  That nasty girl cervix.  Yeah.  With all those things on it.  Just flick your tongue around the lips a little and let her do the work by grinding like a dog 
[00:47:30]  on the floor.  Just know every time you bottom out, that's what you're hitting.  That diseased little disc.  That diseased little fucking disc they got in them.  What is bottom out?  You never hit fucking cervix?  You never bottomed out, Jimmy?  Not even with a fucking...  I was trying to think of something that hit a cervix.  The bat was the first one, but I'm like, why would you put a bat in a pussy?  Creep.  Nothing worse than a short...  Yeah, I've hit cervix.  Nothing worse than a short back wall.  Ah, you don't like hitting that cervix. 
[00:48:00]  No, I mean a short one.  I love hitting cervix.  Love it.  Yeah, you like that?  Yeah.  Then all that goop is coming off of it onto the head of your dick.  We're going for my dick on TV.  Yeah, true.  They're battling it out.  It's like the battle scene in Braveheart.  We're diseased.  Yeah.  You know we're doomed.  Let's take a break.  Patrice O'Neill and Nick DiPaolo today.  That's strong.  That's some strong shit right there. 
[00:48:30]  What time are they coming in?  Another hour or a little less.  I don't know.  And then after the break, we've got to talk about my favorite subject.  Rats.  Rats.  They've got a great story on rats.  Here's a question as we go to break for you, Anthony.  Oh.  What part of the city has the most rats?  I'm not going to answer.  Until after the break.  I'll wait until after the break.  And what part of the city has the least amount of rats?  Figure this one out for everybody, okay?  I'm going to try to use some logic.  Yeah, use some logic.  Yes.  All right?  I'm going to eat my sandwich. 
[00:49:00]  And we'll have the answer next.  The virus.  Sirius.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  O.P. and Anthony.  Remember these guys, Blind Melon?  Shannon Hoon.  I think he died yesterday was the anniversary.  One-hit wonder.  Right?  It is today?  One-hit wonder. 
[00:49:30]  I thought I saw it yesterday.  Fifteen years ago today.  Wow.  We lost Shannon Hoon, who was supposed to be a big, big thinger.  They were expecting big things from this Shannon Hoon.  But where's the B-Girl?  What became of the B-Girl?  We've done this bit.  Yeah, but we did this bit a long, long time ago.  Where is she now, now?  Oh, that's...  That's what I wanted to know.  You know what?  I'm pretty sure...  God bless you.  This will kill another ten minutes.  I'm pretty sure we did this exactly a year ago today.  We did, right? 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I had the worst deja vu right there.  This is crazy.  I know where the B-Girl is.  Where is she, though?  I totally don't remember.  That means we got to do it again.  Someone says she's kind of hot now.  No.  I would go the other way with this.  She was a little fat thing.  Oh, she's the Russian spy.  She's the Russian spy.  That's her.  Okay.  Well, you know what?  Was Blind Melon supposed to be...  Not bad.  Was Blind Melon supposed to be a great band? 
[00:50:30]  Because now they're just known as a one-hit wonder because he died.  They were going to be in the same category as, like, Smashing Pumpkins or something.  You think?  Yeah.  In that whole era.  Yeah.  What was their second album really just flopped, too?  They had, like, one song on that album.  What was their second biggest song?  I love doing this game.  Oh, Dark Knows It?  This sucks a dick.  Yeah, let's see.  That's it.  Yeah, this is it. 
[00:51:00]  This...  It'll kick in.  The fuck is this crap?  It's all right.  Funeral scene.  Yeah, funeral.  Yeah.  It's like a New Orleans.  Funeral scene from Live and Let Die.  Fucking Patrice.  Yeah, it is.  Big mama prods in studio.  Wow, that song sucks.  All right, he's not missed.  No.  We're going to hear 15 years of this shit if you didn't die early. 
[00:51:30]  I don't know, man.  It's a little catchy.  Now it's getting to me a little bit.  No, it's not.  I don't hate it a little bit.  This is just the beginning.  Oh, it kicks in?  Oh, now it rocks.  It becomes a real song.  That's good.  That's good.  You guys missed it. 
[00:52:00]  Tones of Home was their second hit.  That's right.  Tones of Home?  Yes, J.D. in New York City.  Tones of Home was before No Rain.  Oh, fuck.  Face on you.  That's a huge face.  So No Rain was their second hit.  Because everyone looks at No Rain as the one they won. 
[00:52:30]  No Rain is the only song that anybody cares about from that stupid band and that bitch in  the street outfit.  I got to tell you, Tones of Home was a big song for these guys.  This song was played all over the fucking place.  I had no idea this came before No Rain, though.  So far, A, I don't know a beat.  It's terrible.  I like the Spin Doctors.  Isn't that what this is?  No?  Well, there was a sound 15 years ago.  Yeah, there certainly was.  A few bands had the same sound.  Of him letting out his last breath. 
[00:53:00]  See?  Because he's dead.  This is fucking horrid.  This really came out before No Rain.  Fuck.  Yeah, this came out in September 92.  No Rain came out in June 93.  92.  Filthy hippies.  You don't know it, Jimmy?  If you told me that this was Rush two weeks ago, I'd believe you.  All right, we're going to try that someday.  Almost has a little Perry Pharrell sound to it. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You remember this, right, Ant?  Oh, hells yeah.  Never heard this.  I remember being at the AF.  Also, they released it again.  Looking at 15-year-old girl titties.  They released it after No Rain again.  Oh, good?  Yeah.  All right with this fucking mediocrity.  What bothers you, Jimmy?  Stupid.  Mediocrity.  Just dumb.  Fuck, it's meaningless.  If you turn this song off, I'll literally forget that it ever existed. 
[00:54:00]  You're like a goldfish with this song.  Five seconds into whatever we're talking about.  If they ever shut it off.  Right.  We know.  And then someone saying Change was a big song for them, but I guess we're done with our  Blind Melon talk.  If that was the number two hit.  They had one hit, and then they went off a cliff.  Fucking put on bee suits.  What's up, Patrice?  Oh, good morning.  You hear us talking about the fact you could get cancer from eating pussy today?  Yeah.  I've been... 
[00:54:30]  You've known that one before?  All this cancer stuff.  I've got this weird thing on my throat.  I've been doing this for probably seven years now.  We do.  Isn't that a nervous thing, though, or something, they say?  No, it's phlegm.  It's some kind of...  Some kind of cancer growing?  It's a permanent phlegm.  Is it diet?  Because I have it, too.  I don't know.  I'm constantly doing that.  I'm just working out dying now.  That's all I'm doing is working out, hoping it is a heaven.  That's it.  You try to be courteous when other people are around.  You do a little...  When you're alone, I would go like... 
[00:55:00]  And it ain't even phlegm that's coming.  It's just a constant something there.  It feels like something is there.  And I'm not going to check it out.  I'm not.  No, no.  I'm just not.  Could it be dairy shit?  What?  I wonder if it's that, too, man.  Or talking.  A little dairy action?  Talking doesn't a lot to me.  Singing.  I don't try to...  At this point, I go like this.  Anytime something's wrong, I just go...  It just is what it is.  You said something very interesting in there that went by everybody. 
[00:55:30]  Hoping there's a God.  What age do you start hoping there's a God?  Because when you're young and stuff, you're like,  Fuck church.  Fuck all this crap.  I don't need...  I have too much to do.  And then something happens.  You get a little older, and all of a sudden you're like,  Oh, fuck.  I want to start looking into this shit.  The first time you're on a date and her hand is near your dick,  then you start hoping there's a God.  Yeah.  That's a great answer.  I just lay up in that.  Is it when you turn 40?  Is 40 the big age?  Where you start going, Oh, fuck.  When you start sitting on the edge of the bed...  If I'm lucky that my life's half over, 
[00:56:00]  if you make it to 80,  and then if you really start thinking about it,  the next 40 is the shitty 40.  Put it in a good 40.  You got to know if aspirate came.  I'm off of that because of you.  It kills you.  I mean, anything that literally does kill you,  you want to...  I'm still working out meat.  I did the vegan thing,  but then it was for like almost a year,  and I was killing myself worse  because of all the soy products  and all the fucking salt  that's in and all the fake things. 
[00:56:30]  And animals are delicious.  They are,  and I try to figure out...  I read the thing about fish.  They have no real reason for you not to eat fish  except for mercury in the water.  So we fuck up the fish.  We fuck the fish up.  But as an animal,  fish is not bad to fucking eat.  But I've been trying to figure...  The thing,  how to stay alive is I can't do.  Me and a buddy of mine,  we go out twice a week  and experiment with this raw.  But the thing about raw, 
[00:57:00]  you got to have a lot of money to eat raw,  and you can't do it at home.  It's like raw...  What do you get when you eat raw?  Well, if you do it at home,  you got to stay...  You got to prepare your meal  for next Friday today  to make your fucking cashew butter  or your peanut cheese  that you're going to fucking...  What the fuck is that?  And you got to eat it now.  Almond butter.  You can't put fucking...  Eating raw,  you can't go,  I got leftovers. 
[00:57:30]  Like I bought some raw sushi  made with asparagus.  Nice.  Something or another.  Some rice substitute  that is not rice.  It's natural.  And seaweed.  Your leftovers is called mulch.  It's despicable.  It's just...  I go, what the fuck?  But that's why you shit so well  or whatever.  But are you suffering  when you're eating this stuff?  No.  If you pick the right thing,  you really have a good time,  but...  Where can you eat it?  There's restaurants?  Rough food?  It can't be like a steak.  There's two...  There's a good one over on...  There's one in Harlem, 
[00:58:00]  and then there's a good one...  Where's the one I would go to?  The one in Harlem's excellent,  but the one in...  It's an Irvin place.  Irvin Plaza?  Irvin Plaza.  It's called some shit.  I don't know.  Is it vegetarian?  No, man.  So they got some meat in there.  No.  Fish?  Nothing.  Raw is earth,  and it's live.  It has to be live.  It's not...  I'm so confused.  Yeah, raw eating is live eating.  Like, it's... 
[00:58:30]  What happens is cooking...  This is what they say  what cooking food does.  It takes away half...  The nutrients.  The nutrients.  So that's why you eat...  But that's why  these fat motherfuckers...  They did this thing  where they go,  you try to buy enough calories,  they give you a dollar,  and see how many calories  you can buy?  Mm-hmm.  A dollar will get you  like maybe 10 calories  of good calories,  but it'll get you  47 cookies.  That's sweet.  Which is why poor people 
[00:59:00]  are just dying.  Yes.  Because they can't...  You can afford...  You need the calories  to exist every day.  The shitty calories.  Some third world bitch  cleaning up a fucking hotel  for eight hours a day.  This bitch is probably  living on cookies...  Yeah.  ...and old bread  or some shit.  Dust mites.  She ain't living on raw food.  A two-person raw food  regular meal,  you ain't leaving out of there  less than $90, man.  Now, what exactly  is this raw food?  Yeah, we don't know  what it is.  Like, what's your meal?  Raw meaning, okay,  I'll give you a raw...  Go in and tell us 
[00:59:30]  what you eat.  You go into this place,  what are you eating?  If you get raw lasagna,  it's made...  The cheese is some...  You're crunching  on the noodles?  You need...  The noodles?  Wait a second.  The noodles  are shaved...  Shaved zucchini.  So they shave it somehow.  Exactly.  I'm out.  I didn't even do...  I'm fucking out.  Who knew zucchinis  even grew beards?  Oh, chips.  I'm so out.  So it's one of those...  What did we have? 
[01:00:00]  Let's bring it up again.  Squash spaghetti.  Squash...  Patrice, I almost said it.  You came this...  Thank God.  Danny, I want that address.  We had squash spaghetti.  It was horrendous.  It looked like delicious spaghetti  and it tasted like dog asshole.  We actually looked at our girls  at the time  and said,  knock it off.  Fucking boil up some Ronzoni,  you dumb bitches.  We were so depressed.  You only eat this to live.  It's just not a fun lifestyle.  Raw.  It's a...  You live, though.  Zucchini squash sucks. 
[01:00:30]  Isn't there another way  to do it  to balance it out  like where you eat  in moderation,  you have some chicken  and fish  and a little bit of beef  and then you exercise  and you do things...  The real way.  The real way.  But raw.  Yeah.  Raw is...  Kevin Knox,  who's a comic in Boston,  he died of...  He had...  I forgot what kind of cancer.  He went...  He was supposed to die  a long time ago.  He went raw.  That kept him alive  for, I can think,  an extra five fucking years 
[01:01:00]  or something.  Really?  Raw is for real.  Like, for real.  You can't lose.  But it's just so shocking.  And you can't do it at home  because it's...  It's just too much  to work.  It might be crazy.  We interrupted you, though.  The lasagna.  So the zucchini...  Shaved lasagna  instead of noodles.  Okay.  The actual zucchini  is cut in the shape  of the giant noodles.  Right.  So instead of shaving it,  they cut it.  Right.  And then there's  what they call  either macadamia nut 
[01:01:30]  or cashew cheese  that they make...  We've had this argument.  You can't call it lasagna.  That's the problem.  Because when you see lasagna,  you know what it tastes like.  That's what they call it.  They call it  some of the stuff pizza.  It's like calling a dog  a cat dog.  It's a cat.  Why?  Because I called it a cat.  It's like calling  a pussy a fish.  But you can't call it  fucking bland vegetable nonsense.  You can't call it... 
[01:02:00]  You can't call it...  No one's buying that shit.  You don't think anyone's  buying bland vegetable nonsense?  Raw lasagna.  It's like they have a thing.  It's like some kind of cracker.  Hey.  And it's...  I don't know what they make  but it has to...  Whatever it is,  it's not...  It's not a cracker.  It's some...  Something.  Right.  And then you put olives,  mushrooms,  and some other stuff on it  and they call it pizza. 
[01:02:30]  How is it?  You know,  some of those olives...  It's okay.  ...are in bed, man.  Look,  once your mind  is wrapped around it,  once you wrap your mind  around something,  you can fuck with it.  They do things  that make...  Going down...  You feel better.  You get full faster.  Yeah.  You feel good  but still...  You're missing out.  You go, man.  What about the macadamia cheese  and then what about the sauce?  Yeah, keep going  with the lasagna.  Well,  the sauce is made  of tomatoes  in the blender.  Very good. 
[01:03:00]  Pureed.  Very good.  The only heat  you might feel  is two different things.  It's a dehydrator  that makes,  you know,  jerky,  but they use that  to make the cheese.  They grind up  the peanuts  or whatever they do  and whatever they put in it  and then they put it  in the dehydrator,  put it in there  for a couple of days  and then they peel it off  and that's the cheese.  That's the cheese.  Okay.  And the...  This is great.  And the heat  is the dehydrator. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  So any heat you feel  is either room temperature  or dehydrate...  So nothing's cooked like that.  You don't cook.  Nothing's cooked.  Are you excited  to go to this place  or are you just...  I feel good  because I'm dying.  I have a fucking...  Oh my God.  I have diabetes,  high blood pressure,  my throat's...  And I'm just...  I've realized  that I'm not going  to try to save my life  any other way  except for trying  to eat better.  Yeah.  I might walk around  a building.  That's why I love  having my dogs  and give me a reason  to get the fuck up  and walk.  And walk, yeah.  But other than that,  it's too hard  to stay alive. 
[01:04:00]  It's just...  But you look good.  You look like a healthy guy.  I feel better, but...  You look like a big guy.  You don't look like  a fat guy.  That's what it is.  I've always been a big guy,  but I've been carrying  this around a long time.  My heart...  Look it.  My body has not betrayed me.  I've betrayed it.  My body has been...  It's a strong body, man,  because I do some  fucked up things.  You talking about  this eating pussy...  You know,  I'm sticking my face  in ass.  God knows where it's going.  It's Brazilian pussy. 
[01:04:30]  That's healthy pussy, right?  I mean,  but that's what I'm saying.  It's just like  if somebody's telling me,  like Keith Robinson  once said,  I will quote Keith.  He go,  ah,  fuck that.  I'm not going to the doctor.  I'm just going to be  sitting at the table  and just bump my head  one day,  and then I'll know  I'm going to pass out  and bump my head.  That's it.  And that's how I feel about it,  because I'm not going in there  and you motherfuckers  are just talking about  the vaccine with the boys  and the girls.  You know,  all that shit.  I questionably believe  that that shit  is trying to kill us anyway. 
[01:05:00]  Patrice is on my side.  I was a Navy SEAL.  And this,  but the raw shit,  there's absolutely  no drawbacks to the raw shit.  I want to try it,  because I,  except for,  except for,  but I'm telling you,  these people  are fucking geniuses with it.  If you're able to go home,  I mean,  there's no sugar in anything.  Raw has no sugar.  Sounds great.  So it's like,  what do you have for dessert?  Here's a rock. 
[01:05:30]  Suck on the rock.  Well,  the fact that it costs so much  to make some shit,  I mean,  they brought me a,  I ordered like a,  what they call it,  right,  I mean,  what I call a sorbet or something.  That's maybe a nickel's worth.  Like the size of a nickel.  Yeah,  size of a nickel  and a pineapple  and it was,  it was $19 or something.  Yeah.  Oh,  that's it right there. 
[01:06:00]  Moose.  It's $16.  $16.  But wait,  the frozen coconut moose,  is that,  it gives it sugar in part,  but it's all natural.  It's natural  and they don't,  it's no sugar  and the juices,  they got either water  or fresh juice.  They don't sell fucking.  I see a wine list.  What is the story there?  It's a wine thing,  but it's,  it's a,  it's organic fucking living wine.  It's not,  it's not whatever the fuck.  It's not just organic. 
[01:06:30]  They give you,  they give you a bunch of grapes  and a shill.  Yeah,  right.  And a strainer.  Fast wine or something.  It's probably,  they call it wine,  but it's not fermented or nothing.  Yeah.  Anything that's not natural,  anything that's not actually a,  a,  something that could soak into you,  the body,  the nutrients.  It's not.  All right,  I'm going to try this.  I want to try it.  I mean,  I'm not going to be happy,  but I'll try it.  Crusted almond  and sea vegetable croquettes.  Dude,  like, 
[01:07:00]  look,  the porcini ravioli is good,  but the ravioli is not ravioli.  Of course it isn't.  But look at the three pizzas,  the pizzettes.  Look,  man,  you can't go,  you can't rub your hands together  and go,  oh yeah,  here we go.  It is fucking,  yeah,  give me another slice.  Give me my spinucca,  patita and spinach.  I'm looking at this menu.  I would just be depressed.  I can't,  I don't see anything  I would get excited about.  The sushi is,  well, 
[01:07:30]  the sushi's got to be amazing.  Sushi's really good,  man.  Really good.  Is it fish  or is it just vegetables?  It's only vegetables.  But the fish are living,  no?  Not,  no,  no,  fish is dead flesh.  One of the meals  is local cauliflower  and white grapes.  It sucks.  What do you do with that?  It sucks.  What do you do with that?  And what do they call it?  They call it,  what do they call it?  Spanish.  Holy shit.  Copita with spinach, 
[01:08:00]  almond feta,  cucumber yogurt.  Let me see the next course.  That sounds good.  Feta?  What's the next course?  All right,  try the next one.  I think that's side.  Is that third course?  We'll go to appetizers.  All right,  let's see the appetizers.  Yeah,  let's go to appetizers.  That's good.  Maybe I need some appetizers.  This place is very expensive,  man.  I know shit.  And they look at you like,  what are you doing here,  fat nigga?  I'm like,  I gotta afford to buy  these fucking grapes,  bitch.  Let's make believe  we're at this restaurant.  All right.  Let's try to pick  an appetizer here.  Let me see what I'm gonna order.  Hazelnut.  The salads are fucking, 
[01:08:30]  the salads are amazing.  Derek rules.  We're gonna,  we're gonna.  And you might,  by the way.  All right,  Patrice,  we're ordering.  Wait a minute,  wait a minute.  We're at the table right now.  Tomorrow may be different.  Oh,  okay.  Whatever.  This is today.  You got a menu for today.  I want endive salad.  Let me see.  Try to pick one of these,  Ant.  Let's see what.  Huckleberries.  I'm the huckleberries.  Fucking huckleberries.  That's a bunch of guys acting silly. 
[01:09:00]  That's a bunch of guys acting silly.  Right.  Plate of assorted culture,  Dr.  Cow tree nut cheese,  and rosemary crisps.  What would you pick if you had to?  If I had to,  right now.  Because it's not even like  you could pick something you like.  If you had to.  Okay.  If people are listening,  you gotta read the whole thing.  So everybody.  Have these words I can't pronounce,  Patrice.  I am going with the.  Vegetable nonsense.  I want the king oyster mushroom scallops  with hijaki seaweed caviar. 
[01:09:30]  Nice.  See, it's not real scallops.  They're made of mushrooms.  The mushroom is the key here.  Yes.  Chive.  Turkey.  Chive turkey.  I'll have the chive turkey.  You asshole.  Goddamn, that's so stupidly  funny.  Yeah, I'll go with that.  It's got wilted watercress  and tomato broth 
[01:10:00]  with chive turkey,  not chive cream.  I'm in with the king oyster mushroom  scallops with hijaki seaweed caviar.  Before I pick mine,  they have one dish here  called sweet bing cherry.  Ah, what is that?  That sounds good.  Is that one sweet bing cherry?  And then they fuck it up.  And local wildflower honey compote.  I hate a compote.  But I would go with the  niwa maki of avocado,  enoki mushrooms, 
[01:10:30]  pickled heirloom baby carrots  made with asparagus,  mango, scallions,  and spicy...  All right.  I would do that appetizer.  I wouldn't be happy, but...  We've picked out our appetizers.  At this point,  I would pray that the wine  is really fucking good.  It gets me all fucked up.  I would do it with the scallop thing,  too.  The scallop mushroom.  Yeah, the mushroom.  That's our appetizer.  The house cured olives?  And the cured olives.  With fennel and orange?  That's regular.  Poor olives are sick of something.  Exactly.  I don't know what Dr. Cowtree 
[01:11:00]  nut cheeses are.  And the salad is delicious.  Don't try to push it.  It's the salad, arugula,  and dog piss.  Arugula has good rules.  How about that right there?  Sunflower marinated in dog piss.  That looks delicious.  And aged cashew cheese,  by the way,  which is cheese we ain't throwing away.  We ain't throwing this cheese away  because it's too hard to make.  Really?  Yeah, it's just too hard to make.  All right, go to the garden.  Isn't this what Madonna eats,  by the way,  like a macrobiotic?  Is this like her family?  A macrobiotic, yeah. 
[01:11:30]  Let's see what the next,  it's not fun.  So now for the big meal here.  No, this is only the middle, right?  Oh, shit.  I don't know what the mean.  What's the third is dessert?  Oh, third is dessert.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Okay, so now we're picking our entrees.  By the way,  they only have like five, six choices.  Yeah, this fucking stinks.  Hey, look, pad thai.  Pad thai with kelp noodles  and baby bok choy  which will,  none of it will be cooked though,  by the way.  What the fuck is a kelp noodle?  It's noodles made from kelp, 
[01:12:00]  which is seaweed,  sea stuff.  Pickled.  What's a pickled ramp?  Pickled what?  Ramp.  That's a delicious treat  that a cripple eats.  They ain't got no choice.  And if they hit,  don't be your mouth stupid  to think it's pickled ramp.  And they list parsley  as an ingredient in your dish.  But I ain't pickled ramp.  Shut the fuck up.  Pickle ramp.  Just ramp it into your mouth,  dummy.  You know you're in a bed.  You know you're in a bed.  That's disgusting. 
[01:12:30]  You know you're in a bed joint  when they're selling parsley.  Parsley is part of the ingredient.  Yeah, one of the selling points.  I'm going with the porcini ravioli  with truffle cream sauce,  baby white asparagus,  pickled ramp,  whatever that is,  parsley salad,  and porcini oil.  But the ravioli's not made out of them.  Oh, I know it's not.  Okay.  Oh, please.  What is that,  a mushroom?  I'm not sure, dude.  I'm sure it's something you're trying.  I think porcini's a mushroom,  I think.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah,  porcini mushroom.  Yeah, yeah.  So they flatten it out 
[01:13:00]  and wrap something in it.  Make a fucking ravioli out of it.  So now I've had two mushroom things.  From my appetizer main course,  it's fucking mushrooms.  You already,  your farts already stink like shit right now.  One is to eat cleverly disguised as a scallop,  and this one's cleverly disguised as a ravioli.  Dude, I'm depressed.  I don't think I can pick one of these.  You got it.  The pizzas.  I would go with the pizzas, man.  What is the sweet corn and cashew tamales  with chili spice portobello?  Exactly what it says.  There's a cashew coconut sour cream in this dish. 
[01:13:30]  Fresh coconut soup.  Avocado.  Coconut salad.  Coconut steak.  I hate cokie nuts.  What's the raw,  what's that raw thing in my dish there, Patrice?  Cock.  Cock.  Cock.  Where?  Cock.  Cock.  Cockamole?  Cockamole?  Cockamole.  It's raw cock.  That's what the doctor removes from your cock.  It's guacamole.  Instead of guacamole,  it's guacamole.  Thank you. 
[01:14:00]  Thank you, Karnak.  May you have a cockamole.  May you have to go to the doctor for a cockamole.  A genital treat.  Something you caught off fucking Wagman's porch.  We're not educated.  Every listener is telling us that ramp is an onion or a...  All right, go fuck yourself. 
[01:14:30]  Exactly.  How would anybody know that?  A pickled onion or...  So it's a raw...  Cock, cock, cock...  It's their version of guacamole.  It's all...  It's nothing in it but guacamole,  but avocados.  I would be so depressed at this point.  I would...  At this point,  I'm thinking about pizza on the way home.  They are a sad people, though.  They are, right?  This lifestyle...  A sad...  It's a sad people.  Because they're envying.  And they're a little too white, right?  A little too pale,  a little too washed out.  They're very protective of this world.  And, you know,  when I started messing around with vegan  and then a little raw, 
[01:15:00]  you know,  two times a week I fuck with raw  because I only got one friend that's down with it.  You know what I mean?  Why don't you take us?  We'll go.  Yeah, I'll go.  That would be fun.  I'll go.  That would be fun to go.  You tell me the day next week.  I'm there.  Any day.  We'll talk about it afterwards.  All right.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  All right, let's go to desserts.  I would go  because I have to fucking see this.  I want to go to lunch today for this.  This looks good.  No, it doesn't.  And dive salad?  That'd be great.  Great.  You found one thing.  Exactly.  It's all it.  I will say the desserts, 
[01:15:30]  other than the...  You see this little ball on the side?  That's what you get.  Like, that's...  Other than the size...  That's the size of a golf ball.  Maybe.  But it's really good.  The desserts will...  You'll be happy about the desserts.  So what?  Mexican cinnamon mousse?  What is that?  It's some kind of chili pepper chocolate cake.  There you go.  Pear relish and sorbet.  I don't want pear relish on my cake.  And you're getting...  Hold on.  You're getting confused by saying cake.  That means it was cooked.  Oh, what? 
[01:16:00]  How do they make cake cake?  They do not cook the cake, bro.  That's what I'm saying.  Is it a mushroom, motherfucker?  It's cock.  It's cock-ay.  It's cock-ay.  Yeah.  They jazz it up by using words where you go,  oh, wow, cake.  But how do they make their cake?  Would you like a piece of cake thing?  Yeah.  A piece of cake.  Because you would order that going, cake.  How could cake be?  It's shaped like a cake.  What is it made of?  I don't know.  Then they got this apple tart thing. 
[01:16:30]  Apple cider caramel.  It's an apple with Down syndrome.  I didn't say tart.  An apple tart.  Hort shot ice cream and maple candy.  This shit is different from last week.  Because they only can use the shit that's out there.  The shit's going bad.  But as they're bringing it in, they're panicking.  Hurry, it's going bad.  Shit that's in season.  Right.  I mean, look, dude. 
[01:17:00]  It's un...  Can you have an organic cook?  You can't argue.  Can you have an organic cook come over and make this stuff for you?  Oh, my God.  What would that cost you?  You know how much fucking money?  But I mean, you can do it.  I'm not going to do it.  Oh, yeah.  You can have an organic cook.  Crazy.  You're fucking paying him $100,000 a year.  Yeah, yeah.  Because he has to start cooking today for fucking next Thursday.  Making his stupid cheese.  Making his delicious.  Making his fucking awful cheese stuff.  Nick DiPaolo outside.  Bring him in.  Hey, big Nick.  Yeah, big Nick in here.  How are the dumps, Patrice?  Oh, man.  I'm... 
[01:17:30]  Are they really smelly or are they really...  Dude, let me tell you, man.  I'm...  When I eat...  What's up, Nick?  Come on in, Nick.  Big Nick.  That's all right.  You get the one there.  When I'm eating right, my...  You know, I got to share with my girl.  Like, I'm so...  I get so happy when I have a good shit.  When you eat at this place,  your shits are shaped exactly like your fucking intestines.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  It fills up all the nooks and crannies in it.  Oh, it's just like a...  It's a fucking...  I don't even want to tell Nick what we're talking about. 
[01:18:00]  Is this NPR?  Yeah.  I don't even want to tell you what we're talking about.  This is the worst conversation to have  as Nick walks into the studio.  You know that.  But Nick eats well.  Nick is 52, man.  Not like this shit.  52.  Nick is a fucking middle-aged man.  He's older than everybody in this room,  and look how good he looks.  52.  I'm 48.  Come on.  That's fucking just the same, Nick.  Your prostate's the same swell.  That's all it is.  Yeah, that's true.  Nick doesn't eat bad.  He doesn't eat poorly.  Yeah, but he doesn't eat this shit.  I bet he does.  I bet he doesn't.  I have the prostate of Hyman Roth. 
[01:18:30]  We're talking about the raw food business.  I'd like to try that, but it just don't fill me up.  We just looked at the menu.  We don't even know what to order.  Oh, you're ordering raw food for breakfast?  No, we're just trying to figure it out.  We're talking about what Patrice's diet is now,  and he's gone to this thing called raw.  It bypasses anything vegan or any of that silly shit I've ever heard in my life.  They have like a lasagna, but it's made with fucking squash or zucchini.  But raw, not cooked?  The cheese is made, because it's not lasagna. 
[01:19:00]  The cheese is made of some kind of fucking nuts that are ground up  and dried in a fucking dehydrator.  The sauces, tomatoes just blend it up, and then they bring it to you cold.  And the cold is on you.  Yes, thank you.  So, you don't have diabetes no more?  If I ate like that all the time, I wouldn't.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  You ain't going to do that.  You know, black people have that kind of discipline.  I mean, black comedians.  I didn't mean in general. 
[01:19:30]  Right, right.  I mean, black headliners from the Northeast.  I mean, you know what I mean.  That's good.  We don't want him dropping dead.  It doesn't sound good, though.  Patrice?  I mean, you could fucking live in a hyperbolic chamber, too.  But, yeah, what fun is that?  It's fucking possible to live like that if you could.  It's just, you could be healthy if you, like you said, you got to cook. 
[01:20:00]  And, look, eating healthy is great when somebody's there to make sure you eat healthy, man.  I got to cook, and I just tell her to, you know, cook healthy and taste it.  Do you have a cook?  Yes, I'm, Mr. Obey.  I'm cooking.  You have a cook?  Runs around with a rag on her head, a do-rag.  Every time this comes up, I got the idea from Anthony.  Living in New York, guess what?  It's about the same as fucking going out and eating and doing the takeout.  He hired Mr. Turkle from The Shining.  I know that sounds crazy when you say you got him. 
[01:20:30]  We got legs of lamb.  Mr. Halloran.  Turkle with the cook was that.  Halloran.  I was going to say, I was thinking.  Hank got a cook a few years ago, and I said, you know what?  And I looked into it, and it's beyond reasonable.  I'm telling Patrice you should get one.  I'm a single guy.  Yeah.  You know, you've got a wife.  Yeah.  Is it 30?  Yeah.  I taught myself to cook worse than I did.  You cook yourself?  Yeah, I love to cook.  I heard you can cook.  I can.  Do you like it?  I love to cook, but that's no way to keep weight off.  What are we doing? 
[01:21:00]  Fucking, what are we doing?  Moth is still here?  I don't know.  I don't know what's going on.  Yeah, we should take this show down the hall.  We just asked Patrice what he's up to, and we're learning.  Yeah, I don't know.  Did you try the Louis XIII?  Completely changing subjects?  Out of your girl's asshole, like you said you were going to do?  No.  I'm saving for something.  See, he's not over that.  It's talking to me like Christine.  I was wiping the bottle off.  I got so scared to drop it.  You polished it up nice?  I put it in a safe.  I was nervous.  Because I'm like, Jesus. 
[01:21:30]  Did you get all my greasy fingerprints off it?  Oh, you just.  Because I handled it a lot.  And you could see all the times he was thinking about just fucking cracking it.  Like around the neck.  Oh.  There's fingerprints around the cap.  And the shitty box.  Yeah, duct tape on the box.  Just so Nick knows.  The fuck are we talking about here?  I had this bottle of Louis XIII at a comedy club gave me an ad about 10, 11 years ago for  doing the right thing.  Yeah, I know.  Isn't that a sound crazy?  The show was on the improv.  And I didn't know what the fuck I wanted to do with it.  And Patrice was in here.  He goes, fuck that.  I'd be interested in that.  So I just gave it to him. 
[01:22:00]  Did you really?  Yeah.  And it goes for like $110, $120 a shot at some of these restaurants and bars.  Yeah.  And like he said, he could see my fingerprints on it every time I was thinking of opening  that shit up.  What's he going to do with it?  You can't drink that shit.  No.  But it's a good thing for.  Get together this stuff.  Do you?  Crack it.  Pink diddy.  He'll look like, yeah, that'll look pimp if he comes out and fucking pours that shit.  But I don't want to pour it for anybody that doesn't appreciate it.  You know what they're going to do with it?  Yeah, fucking Wilson Vance drops the bottle.  You know what they're going to do with it?  They're going to mix it with Mountain Dog. 
[01:22:30]  And Robitussin.  Shut up, fucker.  You got the same shitty friends, man.  Me and Nick got to page each other.  Who's having a cookhouse inside?  Say they don't fuck each other's cookhouse.  Yeah, the same fucking 40-year-old nothing.  They're not coming to each other, but it's not 40-year-old nothing.  I did what?  Have you been to two of them?  I'm in two.  He comes to one and then...  Will you just not do that?  I'm telling you.  What, what, what?  I know what he's going to fucking say.  Go ahead, let's go. 
[01:23:00]  He shows up for the...  He's mad at me.  I know.  Fuck you.  I'm not going to let him do it.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Let's go.  What's the big deal?  I did it as...  Because everybody thought I was a douche for doing it.  No, for Be Healthy, you did it.  I did it as a side.  Let's get it on the table.  Let's go.  It was a side.  That's all I'm going to say.  Go ahead, Nick.  I have a cookout, and then the following year, I invite him back again.  He shows up like $400 worth of Chinese food.  What does that say about my cooking?  It's annoying.  It was like I was trying to be inventive.  Instead of potato salad...  I believe you.  I brought rice and some little stuff to go with the hot dogs. 
[01:23:30]  He had literally...  It was like half the Golden Palace's fucking kitchen.  I didn't think it was an insult, so somebody just was like, why did you do that?  So everyone wanted the Chinese food over the barbecue, probably.  No, no, it was just...  Did you eat any of the barbecue?  Yes!  Oh, okay.  I cooked!  Then he yells at me because I didn't have any steaks, so I had to go get him steak.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, wow, this has been festering.  I didn't have the kind of money you would do.  You saw the house.  Nick's house...  Nick, here's what we should do.  We should combine Nick's house... 
[01:24:00]  I love it, Pete.  ...and...  Language.  Nick's house, in my attitude, is the greatest fucking good time.  Really?  He lives in the fucking...  He lives in the...  But Nick's house, combined with your purchasing it, drops property value.  Nick lives in the fucking Godfather 2 compound.  Oh, really?  Yes.  That's nice.  Like, it's beautiful.  We've heard about this house for a while.  It's a stone house, but I have that window that overlooks a pond.  Oh, see? 
[01:24:30]  Only thing is the wolves and bats.  This is...  I got an issue with the animal.  You can't have a dog.  I got dogs.  My wife's out there at work, and I stand in that window like this, and I...  And there's a gunshot, and her following me going like this.  In that bowl window.  Where my children play with their toys.  I've never seen Opie's crib, but I would say the two best...  Well, the three best comedy abodes I've been to.  Top three.  Top three.  Go with three first.  So, Nick's house.  Is the best house. 
[01:25:00]  Nick's house.  No, Nick's third.  Third, okay.  Oh, motherfucker.  Why do you even bring up the list?  Well, I knew I wasn't competing with this kind of money.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm not going to lie, but Nick...  Comics...  How about my property?  That's what I'm saying.  It's not that.  It's the property.  How much property do you got?  That's what the...  How much does he got?  No, it's not a lot of property, but it's nestled at the end of a private road in the woods.  Nice.  He got a pond.  And it's got like a pond inside an NHL rink on it with fish.  That's nice.  A brick home.  It's a beautiful...  That's what I want.  Everything. 
[01:25:30]  Not brick.  Stone.  Stone.  Stone.  Beautiful everything.  It's not brick.  It's only an hour and ten minute ride at a comedy cellar every night.  But it's worth it.  It's worth it.  Life's fucking short.  I would say Vinny is next.  Vinny has a nice house.  Yeah.  Vinny has a fucking nice house.  God, motherfucker.  I saw it many years ago.  I think he has like five or six acres.  Oh, Favorito?  Probably fucking Vegas, fucker.  What does he got?  He's got five or six acres.  He might have five or six acres.  Oh, Vinny Brand?  Vinny Brand.  Is that old money, too, or all the money he made? 
[01:26:00]  No, it's white trash, stress factory money.  Vinny has no old money.  Vinny was a full lot of kids, right, Jimmy?  Yeah, he's got a bunch of kids.  Yeah, a filthy cracker just like seven years ago or something like that.  What makes his house nicer than Nick's?  Nick's property, like I said, but Vinny's house is probably twice the size.  Well, he's twice as rich as me, too.  He's on a club for 20 years.  Yeah.  Vinny's richer than you, Nick?  I'm not.  Vinny's a lot of money.  What the fuck?  You see the shitholes I'm playing on the weekends? 
[01:26:30]  No justice in this world.  Except for this weekend.  Nice plug.  Yeah.  Really?  I'm making an exception.  I didn't mean this weekend.  I mean a couple weekends ago.  That's a good gig.  Comics is a really good gig, actually.  I just did it.  Yeah, it's great.  But you're doing Foxwoods?  Yeah.  Oh, fun.  Yeah, I'm shooting a DVD on Saturday up there.  That's awesome.  Nice.  Great place.  Yeah.  You should go back.  That's why I'm here to plug it, by the way.  I think I'm going to calm down for a minute.  I'm the worst marketer ever.  And had a rough weekend, so he's not going to be enjoying you, Nick.  Did you?  I don't like taking a hit and then going right back.  What did you do?  Got to let it settle in. 
[01:27:00]  Blackjack.  Play with your guns?  No?  No, Blackjack.  Went there and see Jimmy.  Where'd you go?  Foxwoods.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  I'm heading up there this weekend.  I mentioned that.  Good club.  It's actually great.  Tonight through Saturday.  Patrice started the Foxwoods thing.  I know.  He was the first.  Well, they called me, but I was booked.  And then Jimmy and then Nick.  First three weekends at the Foxwoods club.  Don't take that order and fucking...  Tell me what's great about Vinny's house now.  It's a lot bigger.  He built it himself.  What?  And it's...  It does that.  It's... 
[01:27:30]  What do you mean he built it himself?  He built it himself.  He picked up a hammer?  Yeah.  Well, he's peeing.  He built it.  He bought the property and put his house on the property.  Did he really?  Wow.  And he has a guest room that has like, you know, one of those things in the mall that  you see that lead to the other...  It's a guest house.  He has like a bridge that goes to the guest house.  Yet there's no green room with a comedy club.  He has a bridge in his house?  It's a nice house.  Like a walkway.  Somebody committed suicide. 
[01:28:00]  It's a tremendous house.  And I would say Anthony's is probably the best.  Oh, damn.  Anthony's is made...  It's really nice outside.  It looks...  It's the nicest house I've seen outside.  But inside it's made up like, you know, a dude.  Caligula.  It's a dude's house.  It's a man's cave.  Yeah.  It's a dude's house, but it's very nice.  It's not a douchy...  It's a mafia house.  It's a...  The only thing I can find walking when I'm walking around Anthony's house judging...  Like judging houses.  I didn't know Patrice was judging everyone's houses. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, you have to.  Nick's house only...  Nick tries to be so white.  And he has some kind of shitty stove that they used to...  That Grizzly Adams had.  It bugs me.  Oh, the wood-burning stove.  I'm going to fucking...  I'm going to burn the Franklin stove.  No, the wood-burning stove.  That wood...  It stinks.  The wood-burning stove.  It's the best...  I love wood-burning stove.  It's the best thing.  I grew up with one of them.  I had a real fireplace.  You bought it.  We were still allowed to have heat in our house, basically.  So we had to fucking roll up newspapers and throw it in a wood-burning stove.  It's different for him.  He does it for white reasons.  Nick does it for white reasons.  It was there when I bought it.  Some kind of Republican. 
[01:29:00]  That's why he bought the fucking house.  I bought it from a white guy.  What do you want me to tell you?  It reminds him of happier times.  Yeah.  You just throw a nigga on the fire.  You're not going to a store and getting a wood-burning stove.  I don't like that type of thought.  How much does that wood-burning stove weigh?  You're not going to a store and getting that shit.  No.  It's the fucking house, man.  It's the fucking house.  You're going to a store and get anything if you've got money.  Dude, no way.  Yeah, but I have the manliest room.  That room with...  You know the coat of arms standing in the corner? 
[01:29:30]  Oh, shit.  You got one of those?  Yeah.  The doorknobs are cockhandles.  Cockhands.  Cockhandles.  Cockhandles.  What a faggot.  I got what you meant, but...  But that room, you've got to admit...  Have you been to Nick's house?  You've got to fucking like...  Nick's house is tremendous.  You out-gidded me.  You may have out-gidded me.  It's not a real one.  No, no.  But that room is the...  You know, it's got the post and beam construction with a cathedral ceiling.  Oh, that's nice.  And it's...  That's the room that...  It's got the...  Why haven't we been invited to Nick's house? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, because you've never come on the weekend.  I would go.  We were good.  We were good.  Excuse me, Norton.  I've asked you twice, and you were busy.  No, I never got invited.  Never.  The first cookout I had, you were one of the first people I'd call, and I didn't hear  back from you.  Then the second year, you were busy.  You were booked somewhere.  And this year, I didn't call you.  No, because I looked at your schedule or something.  You weren't around.  I would go, Nick.  I'd check out the house.  But I did, but I did.  It's a beautiful place, man.  The land is...  It's a beautiful...  I call me five people I like in the world. 
[01:30:30]  It's a peaceful place right off the side of the...  Come up for football.  The Tococca...  What is that?  Toconic.  Toconic.  Toconic.  The Tococcus.  It's way up there.  It's a beautiful place, man.  It is.  I can't lie.  It's beautiful.  It's got to be.  You've got to move away from the city to get anything halfway decent to get land.  You wouldn't believe what I'm...  I pay the...  Westchester has the highest property tax in the nation.  Yeah, I'm second.  I came in second.  My town has the highest in Westchester.  Oh, shit. 
[01:31:00]  My side of town has the highest in the town.  Really?  My town has been mentioned in the New York Times.  Yeah.  I'm at ground zero for the property tax war in this country.  What's your yearly...  What's your yearly...  I can't even...  Can't even...  I'm not going to...  So put it this way.  If you pay...  If you hit...  If you hit...  I'm being raped.  It's...  When I read it, I'm like, what am I doing?  Let's say you do...  Unbelievable.  ...a hundred more smoking gun things.  That's such a subtle way of ruining...  I'm busting my balls.  Isn't he something...  The fucking meanness in this guy. 
[01:31:30]  What does that mean?  A hundred...  Smoking gun thing.  I know I missed him.  On TV, he does the smoking gun thing.  Oh, do you?  Okay.  This is no...  I'm just...  Now Nick's got to get laughed at twice.  Oh, shit.  What an asshole.  Because Jimmy's stupid, Nick gets laughed at twice.  I didn't know what it was.  Now that's his way of busting my balls.  I really didn't.  I'm saying, Nick, if you paid...  You guys are some passive-aggressive...  If you paid your house off, like, if you paid off to all the principal... 
[01:32:00]  That's a salary for me, by the way, that show.  If you...  If you play...  If you play...  You're going to tell me Tanya Harding ain't funny?  If you paid your house off, would the taxes still be, like, despicable?  Like, you still have to work hard just to pay the taxes?  Not work.  On the house?  Not work hard.  But still...  It's a big bill.  Here's my taxes every year.  Yeah, that's more than me.  What?  That's more than you?  Do that with your hand again?  No, I'm not going to do this again.  No, no, no.  But the first one. 
[01:32:30]  And how many zeros was that?  No, no, no, no.  That was four.  You meant to say four zeros.  Yeah, yeah.  It's...  It's a one, two, three, four, five-digit number.  No!  And it's...  So is mine.  Wait, yes.  So is mine.  Wait, can you just...  That ain't bad at all, though.  That ain't bad?  Not for fucking his house, man.  Yeah, it is.  When I'm paying fucking school taxes...  We're talking this, right?  I'm paying...  Gives a shit.  I'll give you an idea.  It's more money in school tax than property tax.  I'm paying my school taxes to arsoning. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Because it's something that was...  Seriously.  It's great.  And I don't have kids.  Yeah, yeah.  And I don't live in Austin.  Are you at that number?  A little under there.  That's where I am.  A little under there.  That's where I am.  Jesus.  That's crazy.  It is crazy.  It's a lot of money.  To own property, you're paying a tax...  And then to have some fucking asshole tell me,  you're not doing your part.  You're not patriotic.  You've got to help more.  Yeah, exactly.  Pay more taxes.  Like, go fuck your mother.  I'm paying that, and that's just property tax.  Now it's income tax and everything else. 
[01:33:30]  Fuck you.  It's unbelievable.  Pay more.  Exactly.  You elitist.  Shut up.  That's why I am.  How about you go to work and pay?  Thank you.  Fuckers.  That's where it comes from.  And I went...  Why do you have to make that fucking...  Now I vote in every city and county fucking...  You should see me.  I'm like an old man.  Cocksucker.  I am right in that school.  I'm watching local...  Online.  I'm watching local access.  I can put a tree in my yard, but it's going to cost...  We're not free anymore.  I'm pulling banners out of people's lawns.  We have that discussion all the time. 
[01:34:00]  Fucking Democrat cocksucker.  I'm running over people's lawns.  Knocking over mailboxes.  That's a man act.  I give little kids a finger.  I know who my taxes go to.  I see them stand up and bust up.  I go like, fuck you.  They don't even know why.  Let me apologize.  I was working the math out of my head.  They get pissed when I fuck them.  That is a lot of money.  For that kind of money, you should be able to molest them.  Exactly.  Free of charge.  Exactly.  Sacrifice one.  And that's on top of a mortgage.  That's not even...  That's what I was thinking.  The kid comes out with a bleeding hiney. 
[01:34:30]  I just show my tax bill and they go, you're free to go.  Is your taxes in your mortgage, too?  No.  Oh, they don't do that?  Oh, no.  They do that for you or no?  No, because I had a jumbo loan.  I put so much up front.  Yeah.  That's some blue.  That's a separate bill.  Yeah, the mortgage and the tax.  It's ridiculous.  It's just to have a roof over you.  It's really stupid.  And of course, look, I know I'm not living in a hovel, but the truth of the matter is... 
[01:35:00]  You have a movie theater in your house.  You have the best house I've ever seen.  It's amazing.  How many more years is your mortgage?  I know.  I want to see that joint.  It's an amazing house.  I can pay it off pretty quick.  No, I'm saying.  Is it 30?  That's why I wanted to get into the radio.  Is it 30?  I got a 30, but I dump a lot of extra cash into it.  To buy it?  Yeah, because you know what?  And I've heard from my accounts and shit that you should probably not pay in so much on the principal.  Fuck them.  Pay into it.  I'm thinking like this. 
[01:35:30]  I'm like, fuck that.  I want to get rid of it.  I'm going to be shitting my pants anyway.  It's like, it's my house.  It's not my house, so it's fucking mine.  It's never your house.  Vultuous family members waiting for you to die so they can take it.  No, but it's like you're paying interest to the...  I have almost 90% paid off because I put everything in a principal so I didn't lose it when the stock market fucking shit the bed.  And it's like, what am I going to do?  Fucking give interest to the bank, those scumbags?  My accountant is of the mindset that I could take the extra principal and actually make more interest than I'm paying on the interest. 
[01:36:00]  All accountants say that.  Well, you know, you're going to get an extra amount of points on your money, but how many points on my money am I going to get that's going to first compensate for the interest I'm paying?  So you have to get money on top of the interest you're paying you have to make.  You're almost 90% done?  Yes.  But I paid a lot of money into principal.  Are you getting...  You must be getting letters from the banks saying, Mr. Norton...  Slow down.  Yeah, please.  We need you, sir.  No, I think they want the money. 
[01:36:30]  Anything you can pay them, they want.  You guys should have the houses you have.  They don't want you.  They shouldn't be living in the one.  See what I'm saying?  You guys, come on.  You've got a hit radio show.  I'm fucking scraping by here.  Yeah, exactly.  Jimmy, they don't want your money.  They want you.  Yeah, they want you to pay.  I dump money into principal.  I've been doing it for five years.  That can't make them happy.  That doesn't make them happy.  I hate paying them interest like that.  It fucking sickens me.  And how much are you going to invest to make the money?  That's why they lend money.  It's like, why would they lend you money if they think you're going to pay at all?  No, no, I know.  But it's just... 
[01:37:00]  You wind up paying double your fucking place if you go 30 years.  And you know who runs it?  The Polish.  Of course.  We all know that.  Absolutely.  No, it's not the Polish.  That literal Jim.  Oh, man.  Why don't we...  I love paying principal.  I like how we go from shit to high finance.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it's the same topic.  That's why this show should be a huge fucking interview.  It should be.  It's just whatever the fuck happens.  But really, how much do we teach people?  Ah, fuck them.  Don't do that.  That's stupid.  All right, we're going to take a break.  I eat really hot. 
[01:37:30]  Talks about raw foods.  Ah, your shit.  Looks like your intestines.  And we'll be back.  And we'll be back.  We'll be back on refinancing.  Got a busy show today.  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter. 
[01:38:00]  I get a lot of my info from Big Mama Prods.  I do, too.  I really do.  It's like the news.  Speaking of which, Patrice, really fast.  You're going to be at Bananas Comedy Club, Hasbrook Heights, this weekend, right?  Yes, sir.  Are you really?  Friday and Saturday, two shows each.  But before I move on to Nick, weren't you talking about the NFL on your Twitter?  Because I brought it to the show, and I look like a complete asshole.  Aren't they starting to find for legal hard hits?  Yeah, football's always.  Yeah, they're going to ruin it.  They're going to ruin it.  Legal hard.  The dude from Pittsburgh is thinking about quitting. 
[01:38:30]  No, you're right, Patrice.  They're going to ruin it.  It's over.  It's the reason we watch it, to hope somebody gets...  And Mark Sheriff, or Sheriff, I don't know, but he says something so hilarious.  He goes, NFL has tapes called Hardest Hits Ever, and then they do the Top 10 Hardest  Hitters Ever.  Right.  It's not...  And then somebody else said something that Mike Ditka and some other old coach said,  take the helmets off, and them motherfuckers will stop fucking hitting like that.  Paterno. 
[01:39:00]  Paterno.  Paterno said, take the face mask off.  Right.  He said, leave the helmet, but take the face mask off.  Or just go with the leather helmets.  Yeah.  Meet in between.  The old fucking...  Meet in between with the leather helmets.  And you'll figure out...  Because you know what?  You watch rugby.  That's brilliant.  It's football without...  Oh, yeah.  No, it ain't.  Now, I'll tell you why.  I hate that comparison.  Dude, they are hitting...  Rugby's a little sport.  First of all, it's not.  It's not.  First of all, you...  Can I fucking finish, you cocksuckers?  The proof that you can play rugby... 
[01:39:30]  Nah, but you gotta...  How many black, 6'6", 380-pound black guys that run a 4-5-4 do you see playing rugby?  Try tackling one of those motherfuckers.  All right.  There you go.  He just killed your fucking English.  And the fact...  You have to wear equipment to play football.  Yeah.  I know they are.  And they're all 250 and 260.  And they arm tackle.  Like girls.  I used to say that they didn't tackle.  Those fucking guys are hitting each other. 
[01:40:00]  Nothing like football.  It's not explosion, because they'll kill each other.  No, that's just it.  You hit as hard as they can hit without equipment.  The fact that you don't wear equipment proves that it's not as rough.  If you played football without equipment, you'd have three deaths every week.  What is that?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  You don't think so?  No.  Tatum over the middle.  You catch a pass?  Is someone getting a phone call?  What's going on?  That's betrayed.  Your fucking music.  Oh, my God.  Hilarious.  It's so kind of music.  I know.  It's a soundtrack from when we were kings every time he gets a phone call. 
[01:40:30]  22-inch woof is in his phone.  So now they're going to find guys for legal hits.  Yes.  That's crazy.  It's so funny.  They go, you know, hitting...  The rule is called hitting a defenseless receiver.  Every time a guy catches a ball, he's defenseless.  And always will be.  Right.  That's when you unload on him.  That's why we started watching football.  Yeah.  I was a strong safety in fucking high school, and that's why I played.  You guys are defenseless.  You fucking lay them out.  You hit him.  You try to dislodge the fucking ball.  They interviewed Ray Suggs, the other guy, for the... 
[01:41:00]  They interviewed a couple of the Ravens, and they go, I don't give a crap.  What are they going to do?  I'm still knocking mothers out.  That was the red three of the squeezy.  I'm still going to knock guys out.  What?  That guy Harrison from Pittsburgh?  He's putting motherfuckers out.  Yeah.  Out.  Every game, he's knocking a motherfucker out.  Last weekend was the most vicious weekend.  There was like five incidents.  What do you mean?  Did you see the Atlanta game?  Both guys were unconscious before they hit the ground.  The guy who did the hit, then the guy got hit.  It was vicious because, first of all, why are they doing this? 
[01:41:30]  Because it's never for the benefit of the fucking players.  It's something...  Yeah, yeah.  Because I see things...  Insurance.  It's something going on because...  It's the advertising.  I see something on HBO about the old players.  It's a feminized world.  And their fucking knuckles is poking out of their wrists.  And their fucker can't get up in the morning.  Because Night Train Lane was fucking hitting him with his bar.  And that's what we wanted.  We wanted you to destroy yourself.  That's what we want.  What we want.  Well, you know what's happened, though, Patrice? 
[01:42:00]  Well, what do you think it is?  I'll tell you what it is.  Sorry.  Well, I'll tell you what's changed it.  Yeah, I'm sure that's part of it.  And that and the feminized culture that we fucking live in.  So a few kids get paralyzed.  Big fucking deal.  Let's play the game.  You're going to lose one every once in a while.  No, exactly.  For our entertainment.  But what's happened is, you know, steroids were introduced into the game.  Now you've got guys 6'5", 3'10", running a 4'2", 40.  And joints...  Your joints weren't meant to take that.  Some guys...  Seriously, that's why you're seeing injuries.  And AstroTurf.  When you get hit on AstroTurf, your foot doesn't give. 
[01:42:30]  That's why you have people blowing their knees out.  Their bodies...  You aren't most...  So why don't they go back to grass?  That would help a little bit.  Because, again, that's a money thing.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a lot cheaper for turf.  I always thought it was insane they played on turf.  But it makes for a better hit.  It makes for a more vicious game.  I like the mud and stuff, but I'd rather watch a game on AstroTurf.  I love muddy games.  The mud games.  But the hitting is much more crisp on AstroTurf.  Oh, yeah.  It's a lot more solid.  So why don't you just put a flag on everybody, and they take the flag, and then the man stops running. 
[01:43:00]  I wouldn't be surprised.  That's what we're headed.  Bunch of bitches.  It's not...  I guess to...  I knew what's going to happen.  I'm trying to figure out how, as a football player...  Yeah.  Because I remember, what's his name there?  Key Winuka, one of the guys from the Giants.  One of the guys from England.  He made a play, right?  He got to the quarterback and stopped.  Remember that shit?  He didn't hit the quarterback?  And it was Vince Young. 
[01:43:30]  And he didn't...  Vince Young was getting ready to throw it, but he didn't throw it.  He pulled up?  And he...  Well, they just go like, oh, I know what you're going to do.  You know what I'm going to do.  Let's just stop it right here.  He didn't want to get a fucking penalty.  Right.  So he didn't tackle the guy, and everybody's screaming at him.  But I'm sitting there going...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't blame the fucking guy.  I remember that.  Because that's what they're doing now.  They're fucking penalizing.  There was one hit this week that I think was a little bit fucked up.  Was the Patriots guy.  That's it.  The Patriots guy, because the dude had already fucking dropped the ball, but he was still in the air. 
[01:44:00]  Yeah, Meriwether.  Meriwether.  Left his feet.  And he fucking...  He left his feet.  He jumped up at the same height.  Look at the fucking guy.  Yes, he did.  He left his feet.  And what's his name?  Who's the coach?  For who?  Patriots.  You know, Belichick.  Belichick goes...  He looks at the guy, and he's like, what the fuck?  Rolled his eyes.  What's wrong with you?  He left his feet.  He was even like, what the...  That's not football, you asshole.  Like, what's everything else?  That's what everyone wants to see. 
[01:44:30]  That's how I played.  Yeah, well, that's...  I really did.  Anybody that wasn't paying attention and the whistle hadn't blown, I'd fucking...  I'd get a 40-yard run and just fucking...  I was as dirty as they come.  Oh, safeties either.  Safeties could be the most vicious...  Jack Tatum was...  I played what they call a monster back.  I was strong safety slash linebacker.  My first priority was pass, but I lined up next to linebackers.  It was the best position ever.  Your best player would be that position, the Monday...  We call it a raider, which is a hybrid...  That's right. 
[01:45:00]  A hybrid...  Linebacker slash shaved.  Like, too little to be like a middle, but he had the attitude of a middle, and you could  just hit on little baby receivers.  Yeah.  Like a Nick raising his hand over there.  Only thing that bothers me is, please, stop with the prayer hands.  Oh.  I don't want prayer circles, and I don't want the visiting crowd to be quiet after you get  fucked up.  You should be like...  I don't want no thumbs up.  Can I add one thing?  How long is Breast Cancer Awareness Month? 
[01:45:30]  It's longer than Black History Month.  Gotta watch every guy fucking felon dressed in pink.  It's creepy to see me think.  Yeah, that's what that shit is.  It's some woman's movement once again sticking their fucking beak in.  Can we put an emblem on the field?  I'm not saying.  Look, I'll send money...  Jesus Christ.  I'll send money to a Breast Cancer Awareness.  I'll donate money.  White people got 10 more months.  I'm just saying.  My goalies...  It's white history year.  Give a nigga a month and give bad titties a month, too. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, but the pink is...  What the fuck is wrong with you?  The pink is what we have a problem with.  It's the pink.  My goalie's going to be wearing pink goalie pants.  No, exactly.  It's hockey.  It's enough.  All right.  Put an emblem on the field.  We get it.  It's symbolism.  Sure.  But Jesus Christ.  Pink everything up.  And once again, because it's an all-male thing.  It's the same reason they have broads on the sideline.  And just letting you know that they're higher women.  It's really a fucking horrible time to be white heterosexual, man.  Yeah.  Yep.  Absolutely.  You don't like the broads on the sidelines either, right?  I hate that shit.  Pussies. 
[01:46:30]  Pam Oliver doesn't offer anything.  Thank you.  I don't hate her, but she doesn't offer anything.  I hate it because I know why she got the job.  Exactly.  Or these girls got the job because they look good on TV.  No, because they're a knowledge of a 3-4 defense.  Yeah, sure.  Let's go to Susie Colber, a little Jewish woman, and tell me how a 4-3 defense works.  Yeah, what, are we going to go to fucking Ray Lewis for daycare tips?  What a backwards, upside-down fucking world.  P.U.  With your fucking political correctness.  P.U.  Language.  You fucking liberals are done, November.  You're going to take it right in your ass.  But do you think it's women in terms of, like, football? 
[01:47:00]  Dude, are they getting together to make football less violent?  No, no.  The only setup would be that they would make it less violent so they can play with men somehow.  Well, they have their own league now.  Well, it's not the players, right?  Like the lingerie one is beautiful.  No, because Ray Lewis needs to be able to fuck you up.  Yeah, the players don't want less violence, obviously.  Quarterbacks can't be touched.  It's society as a whole, though.  It's creeping in.  PC is creeping in everywhere.  You know what I mean?  You said creeping?  Creeping in. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  What's creeping?  Okay, it's not creeping.  It's a full-blown...  I wish it was just creeping.  Then we'd have a shot.  Yeah.  To push it back.  We only have ourselves to blame.  Fucking...  You know what I mean?  Just go, no.  No fucking pink gloves.  No fucking emblem.  By the way...  I don't think that hockey player should have a fucking...  Dude, don't even get me started.  The blowjob gesture?  No, the guy that roughed up the dude on the sideline for a second.  Gave him the...  What are you fucking...  Grab him, snatched him up, and they said...  They're going to suspend him probably about 10 games or so. 
[01:48:00]  Wait, which one was it?  The fan?  Yeah, the fucking guy grabbed the fan.  Yeah, I think he should be able to grab the fan.  Me too.  I do too.  Who was the basketball player that ran into the fucking stance?  That was a whole nother fucking...  Oh, my God.  I love that too, though.  That's true.  I love the guy talking about his daughters.  Because somebody was talking about somebody...  No, no, no.  That was on the Trailblazers.  He got hit with...  Beer.  Yeah.  Glass of beer.  No, no, no.  This was in the Trailblazers.  One of the Portland Trailblazers is railed...  Because somebody was talking about their daughter or something.  Some death thing that a fan was heckling them with.  And they fucking ran up and attacked them.  You know what? 
[01:48:30]  Jeez.  100% of the times when the fans are attacked, they deserve it.  Oh, absolutely.  100%...  I would say 100%.  Yeah, no one's ever gotten attacked just for going, go team.  Right.  Because we've all been to sporting events.  You see these guys.  The Artest thing?  That was so funny because...  Amazing.  But he went after the wrong guy.  I know.  There was like a white guy just minding his business.  He fucked up a little bit.  And Artest is coming out.  This guy was like...  I was like, hey!  He had this look of fright because there was a guy behind him that threw the cup of beer.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like, man, I didn't do shit.  And Artest thought it was this little white guy.  It was the funniest guy.  Yeah, the look on that guy's face.  He was petrified. 
[01:49:00]  Patrice, what's up?  Isn't football a gladiator?  Yes, it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's just a whole...  Absolutely.  A spectacle that those guys know...  Know that there's a risk and it's a life and death kind of...  It's just like MMA.  It's really a gladiator thing.  It's entertainment.  Yes, it is.  Can we go back to the hockey thing, though?  It's entertainment.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know the incident, Patrice, with the hockey guy.  What do you mean?  With the fan.  How did that happen?  He walked...  He walked...  The guy was doing something...  It's tough to get to the fans in hockey. 
[01:49:30]  No, he got kicked out the game and he was walking.  Oh, okay.  Through the breezeway or whatever.  He was clapping and saying something to the guy.  Right.  And the fucker just snatched him up.  And he let him go.  He didn't hit him, but now even...  If Barry Melrose says it's bad, then it's like he's going to get suspended.  He has to say that.  He has to.  He's a spokesman for the league.  Meanwhile, he's laughing off camera.  And that's the thing about sportscasters now.  They've become...  They're horrible.  ...fucking pussies.  Yes, they have. 
[01:50:00]  The worst.  The worst.  Dan Dierdorf, who used to be like one of the dirtiest players for the Cardinals in the 70s.  He was the most vicious...  One of the most vicious players.  Him and Conrad Dobler.  Two dirtiest linemen in the history of the NFL.  Now he's like, oh, that was uncalled for, that face mask.  Oh, was it?  They've got to watch this stuff.  Yeah.  And now he's...  Such bullshit.  People of Rome, Maximus Borrelius will be wearing a pink shield today for Breast Cancer Awareness Month.  Are you not entertained?  As he takes on the horde. 
[01:50:30]  Can't we just write a check?  With fucking Nerf swords.  Yeah, with Nerf swords.  Just...  It's something getting...  Look at...  Oh, ladies and gentlemen, Caesar's giving a thumbs down for that.  It's PC, man.  This isn't good.  This isn't good.  You can't hit...  I'm going to tell you the most vicious hit I've ever seen...  Kermit Washington.  Fucking...  Kermit Washington...  Remember that punch?  Knocking out Tom Donovitz.  That's right.  Holy shit.  Face shattered like a plate.  Like a China plate you dropped in a driveway. 
[01:51:00]  Because they were both running at each other.  No.  That was the one where he was...  Kermit Washington...  Was running toward him as well.  What a great place to drop a plate.  You can't not break a plate in a driveway.  It's impossible.  No saving it.  Yeah, I say that because I dropped a pizza stone once that somebody gave me, like, ten minutes later for a gift.  What the fuck's a pizza stone?  You cook pizza on him.  Put it in your oven.  It heats up like a...  Huts up?  It heats up.  Hello?  Hello?  It's a big flat rock to make better pizza?  Yes.  You should have dropped it. 
[01:51:30]  You should have thrown it at him.  What kind of shit gift is this?  Mushroom rock.  Go fuck yourself.  Jimmy gets annoyed, though.  I love it.  What a horrible gift.  What a rock.  What are you talking about?  You can do your laundry on it down by the river?  Exactly.  Great thing to bludgeon an old woman with.  Her own pizza stone.  Greatest hit ever, Kermit Washington?  Oh, it's Sam Huff on Frank Gifford.  That's terrible.  Sam Huff on Frank Gifford.  You've got the wrong guy.  What's his name?  Chuck Bednarik.  It wasn't Bednarik?  Yes.  With a shoulder pad was the hardest hit I've ever seen. 
[01:52:00]  A shoulder pad made of pillows, too.  It wasn't helmet to helmet.  It was...  He patted him in there.  They used to hit you nasty with your shoulder back then.  It was really...  Dirty.  Nice.  How about Sammy White going over the middle in the Vikings' Raiders Super Bowl and Tatum  laying him out?  Remember his helmet?  Jack Tatum was brutal.  He was the best ever.  The guy should be in the Hall of Fame.  He was my idol.  He was paralyzing motherfuckers.  He was the baddest motherfucker ever.  You was going to get paralyzed, you fucking around over the middle. 
[01:52:30]  He was 5'10".  Listen to that.  5'10", 220 pounds.  Ran a 4'440.  That's like a little missile.  And he was as vicious as...  He grew up in the same project as George Foreman.  George Foreman used to beat him up and take his lunch money.  Did he really?  Yeah, it was in the book.  That's a true story?  They call me assassin?  Yeah.  George Foreman used to beat him up and take his lunch money.  I guess he fucking got pissed off at that, huh?  This guy was a badass...  That team's George Foreman for all the...  No shit.  All the broken balls. 
[01:53:00]  His family should sue George Foreman.  Daryl Stingley's family is fucking making food on the George Foreman grill.  Daryl fucking Stingley.  Can I get another panini?  Thank you, George Foreman, you motherfucker.  I cannot walk now because of George Foreman.  Tatum.  Tatum just died, right?  He just died.  He was my favorite, and they had another guy, George Atkinson, who was the cornerback  that played with him.  He was number 43.  He owns a liquor store in Oakland.  Give you an idea.  Oh, wow.  But he...  A set of balls. 
[01:53:30]  How often do you get robbed?  When the Raiders and Steelers played, when the Raiders and Steelers played, do you remember  Len Swan went out for a...  He wasn't even in the play.  He's just running a pattern.  Tatum comes up from behind with a forearm.  Knocks him out.  He's not even in the play.  Knocks him unconscious.  But the dude for the Pittsburgh Steelers was even worse than...  No, nobody was worse than the Raiders.  Mel Blunt.  He was a mean...  They started rules for Mel Blunt.  No, right?  It was the Raiders.  Because Mel Blunt used to beat your fucking ass.  That's when he started the five-yard rule.  He was a real bad guy.  But get back to the Lin Swan thing. 
[01:54:00]  Well, he just laid him out.  It was the second play of the game.  And he wasn't even in the play.  And then when the Patriots played the Raiders in the 70s in a playoff game, AFC Championship,  first play of the game, George Atkinson runs up and punches Russ Francis in the nose  and breaks his nose for no reason at all.  Just like a street fight.  Whang!  And they had it on replay.  They showed it like eight times.  Russ Francis runs off.  Big tight end, nose all bloody.  No fucking suspensions back then.  What was Pete Rozelle doing?  They went to court.  They went to court because of the Len Swan hit. 
[01:54:30]  They actually went to court.  And they put Chuck Dahl on the stand.  And they asked him, does your team have a criminal element?  And this is the Steelers.  They weren't as dirty as the Raiders.  And he goes, yeah, we do criminal stuff.  It's not that you admit it.  The criminal element was the same guy.  He was a mother, too.  He was a piece of shit.  What fucking happened?  Like, what happened from then until now?  But it didn't.  Now they're wearing pink.  You think Jack Tatum would have wore pink on the field?  Are you kidding me?  And I'm fucking, what he would have been like, oh, fuck their titties. 
[01:55:00]  You are paralyzing niggas.  That was Patrice, by the way.  He's a lot of sayings.  I don't give a fuck about no titties.  The only pink you're going to see when it opens somebody's head.  The guy would make you so hard, you'd line up the next week or something.  Oh, stop it.  Fucking chip.  Steelers, Raiders in the 70s, there was nothing better. 
[01:55:30]  Who was the guy from San Francisco?  Which one?  Yeah, I'll tell you.  The safety.  Ronnie Lott.  Ronnie Lott, who cut off his own finger.  He had to bust the finger and he was like, you got to lead the game.  He goes, nah.  He cut it off.  He had to cut off and wrap it up so he could finish the game.  Holy shit.  I'm telling you.  But it didn't start getting bad.  Wait, wait, wait.  You can't just casually say that.  I don't know this story.  Well, it's a known story.  I really don't know this.  He broke his pinky.  Yeah, because Jimmy's look was priceless.  In some weird way.  On the field.  And they were like, oh, we got to take.  He says, no, fuck that. 
[01:56:00]  Cut it off.  He cut off his.  Why can't he play with a crooked.  Cut off like a knuckle finger, though.  I don't know.  I think it would have been infected.  It was a request by his wife.  He actually cut off the tip of his finger.  Yeah, during the game.  You know, Matt Mellon, we talk about the broadcast turning into pussies.  Matt Mellon, you know, he's the guy that was the GM for the Detroit for the last 10 years.  He signed his letter of intent in blood when he went to Penn State.  Wow.  Dude was great, man.  He gets recruited by Maryland, right? 
[01:56:30]  Goes down to Maryland to visit this, you know, out of high school to visit Maryland.  Him and the strength and conditioning coach have a bench lifting competition.  And Matt Mellon ends up beating him up in a fight.  He's the type of coach that's recruiting him.  Which, by the way, is why fucking Jim Brown is the baddest motherfucker.  Yeah, he's a baddest.  I hope he dies, though.  Because Matt Mellon.  Racist piece of shit.  Jim Brown?  Racist wife-beaten piece of shit.  He's a racist.  He's a racist with his I hate white people hat. 
[01:57:00]  Of course.  Wait a minute.  Anybody that wears a kufi.  What is this, Nigeria?  I would wear kinty cloth draws.  He used to play where a white boy stomped on his nuts every time he got tackled and called him coon.  And your point is?  Take that coon.  Is this what I'm going to be racist?  No, but he was racist to him.  He was a badass back then.  You'd think any white person had the balls to...  Come on. 
[01:57:30]  He was a badass.  Holy shit.  I didn't know Nick knew so much about football.  I have no idea.  I have no idea.  What do you think about it?  I was obsessed with it.  Now I can't stand the NFL.  It's frustrating, right?  Do you guys...  Is it on...  Can I say that?  Nah, fuck it.  It don't matter.  It's good.  It doesn't matter at this point.  It's the worst.  It started with the T.O.  You can feel it with the horse collar rule.  Once they put the horse collar...  I agree, Trace.  Absolutely.  I go, something's wrong.  Because the horse collar...  My thing is, how are you supposed to...  T.O.  Pack a guy from behind.  Is 6'5".  That's right.  2'25 all muscle. 
[01:58:00]  How the fuck are you going...  Without trying to take his knees out.  You need to fucking take his knees out.  And ride his back to get him down.  Unless you tag him.  How about this?  Maybe they could have something hanging off the shirt that you could grab.  Because a lot of guys did get hurt.  You know, horse collar from behind.  Maybe they could leave it like a 6-inch rope so you could...  You know what I mean?  You could yank him.  Whoa, Nelly.  Whoa, Nelly.  How about a long, hard stick you can hit his foot with?  Like, why are we figuring this shit out? 
[01:58:30]  Because you're supposed to be able to jump on the back of this motherfucker's head.  Take him down, right?  Take him down.  Take his ass down.  But I do understand how that rule came about.  Because I saw more guys getting fucking hurt in their knees and ankles.  You know, getting tackled from behind.  I understand, but I agree.  It's a gladiator sport.  It comes with it.  When you come over the middle, you might get knocked out.  That's part of football.  It's the reason people watch.  Yeah, yeah.  It's not arm tackling.  Can I say this, too?  It's bullshit because it's fake legislation. 
[01:59:00]  It's not how people really feel.  It's just like, hey, let's stop this.  Yeah, that's the whole world.  That's the whole world.  It's like everybody's sitting there...  You said that about rape laws.  Everybody's sitting there fucking pretending like they don't want to see motherfuckers get hit.  But if that was the case back in the days where the hits was brutal and you weren't getting up, people would go, oh, this has to stop.  Yeah, we've got to stop that.  This has to stop.  Yeah, why didn't they do that?  No, but it's more brutal now than ever. 
[01:59:30]  The NFL, the guys are so much faster and bigger.  People are getting laid out.  This past weekend, I couldn't believe what they were showing.  The Tampa Bay-Atlanta game, this guy coming over the middle, this guy hit him.  So he must have got a 30-yard run.  They were both unconscious in midair.  The guy that did the hitting and the guy that caught the ball, their arms were like, you know how their arms...  I've got to see that clip.  Patrice, you know how they get this...  You ever see when a guy gets knocked out, their arms get locked up?  They're both...  There's a picture in the paper.  They're both horizontal and their arms are already in this position.  Wow.  And then the kid get paralyzed at Rutgers this week. 
[02:00:00]  I mean...  But that was a complete mistake, though.  It was kind of a freak accident.  But he's 275 pounds a kid.  He's on kickoff coverage team.  He's on kickoff.  Yeah.  That's how fast these guys are.  Giant.  You couldn't catch him.  Yeah.  You couldn't catch him.  He tackled the guy, lowered his head, and he hit the guy with the ball, which just hit  him wrong, and it's just horrible.  It stinks, that story.  It's horrible.  Football's in trouble, though, man, because these guys are getting too big and too strong. 
[02:00:30]  They have to...  Here's the thing.  Somebody made a good point on the way in here.  They were talking about it on another show, but it's true.  The guy's huge, and the field is still the same size.  It's almost the argument they make in the NBA, how big the guys are.  They haven't changed the size of the field.  You know what I mean?  If you gave them a little more room...  So if they play in Canada, the Canadian, the giant field...  Maybe.  Maybe.  I don't know.  You know?  But then again, that gives a guy who's doing the hitting more of a head start.  100 yards is a lot of room.  Exactly.  If I get a good angle... 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, you're going to really...  Oh, just torpedo.  Harrison has a better angle than he had.  Just he fucking runs full speed.  Like fucking soccer field size.  He can really...  And hits that little Maurice Jones drew.  This is when I knew Jack Tatum was a badass.  Earl Campbell, who was my favorite running back of all time.  He'd run over people.  He could run around you.  He was 235, by the way.  Ran like a sub 4, 440.  He ran into Jack Tatum on the goal line.  Head-on.  I mean, head-on collision.  Helmet on helmet.  Oh, when he spins around? 
[02:01:30]  He spins around, falls in the end zone.  Earl Campbell does.  Doesn't get up.  Tatum's just standing over him.  I mean, he fell in the end zone, but Tatum just walks away.  Earl Campbell's down for like five minutes.  And this guy used to run over, you know, defensive players like they were little girls.  He never even put his arms out, Tatum.  Just clang, helmet on helmet.  The guy must have a cement head, man.  What about two tall Jones?  What about that guy?  Tall guy like that, knocking around. 
[02:02:00]  Hey, we've got to get a plug-in for Nick's shows at Foxwoods.  You start tonight, right?  Yeah, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.  This is going to be a strong show.  Nick DiPaolo at Foxwoods Casino.  Can't wait.  Haven't been updated.  Yeah, tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday.  There you go.  How do they get tickets, Nick?  Tickets, you can go to comics, C-O-M-I-X, at foxwoods.com, or 1-800-200-2882.  Do you remember that?  Yeah, I did.  Holy shit.  I've been doing a lot of press for this.  It's a good gig, man. 
[02:02:30]  I did it last week.  It's fucking...  Good room, Jimmy?  It's a great room.  I was surprised how much I liked it, yeah.  Really, really good.  I'm going to try to shoot a DVD Saturday night, so come on out, folks.  We want to pack the place.  Nothing looks worse on a DVD than 11 people.  Yeah.  Maybe you're falling on the train tracks.  What happened?  What happened?  Some dummy falling on the train tracks.  Again?  But why are people wanting to help?  How do you fall on the tracks?  I don't know.  Don't help those people.  How do you fall?  You know why?  Because you want to get on, you know, true TV. 
[02:03:00]  That's it.  But a guy ready...  I'll be commenting on that clip in a few weeks.  I really didn't know that.  Some guy jumped in to get him.  Why would you jump in?  Exactly.  Save yourself.  Look at the dummies trying...  Can't even climb up the fucking side.  How close was this?  Yeah, it's one of those rails...  Oh, yeah.  750 volts.  Oh, that's good.  Look at this asshole kid.  Get up, you fuck.  I love yelling at the television.  How annoying.  It's nothing more fun than yelling at the TV.  It is so useless.  It's so useless.  But I do it all the time.  That's why I wanted to get into the radio, so I could yell all the time, right? 
[02:03:30]  Yes.  But it's annoying, because all of a sudden, now you have to save the fuck.  Now you don't.  Or you look like an asshole.  I'm going to stand there.  Right?  That's true.  You don't want to save them.  That's right.  Can you imagine?  There he is just standing there, not even helping the guy.  Hey, is that Anthony from Hoping Anthony?  See, with his arms crossed.  I wouldn't have fucking jumped down for my girlfriend.  Me either, Jimmy.  Baby, get up.  You'd make it look good with the shower.  Train coming in a few minutes.  Get up.  It's that third rail that I'm worried about.  Fuck yeah.  Why do white politicians always have to be seen with black children? 
[02:04:00]  I just want to know, what is that deal?  It's called getting votes.  From who?  Black people.  But they don't need the black vote.  They need the white vote.  Why is that lady fucking...  There's more white people.  Why is she wearing a fucking bathroom on television?  I've been asking that question, Anthony, for a long time, and I'm deemed as racist for  asking it.  I don't know.  I'm deemed as racist.  I don't deem you as racist for asking it.  It's probably the terminology you use.  What are you talking about?  You don't phrase it like Anthony.  It's just every time you saw Hillary Clinton reading a book. 
[02:04:30]  She's sitting there reading a book, and they show the kids, and it's just all black  children.  Yes.  They never go to the white school and visit the little white kids and read to them.  No.  Oh, she's very sincere when she spoke to black people.  I don't been a long ways tired.  Oh, God.  Remember that?  She tried to do that voice, that accent.  Oh, shit.  I ain't been a long ways tired.  Can you imagine...  Shut up.  It's like Alfalfa doing a fucking play.  Don't black kids deserve to be talked to? 
[02:05:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's every time.  Yeah.  That's every time.  By their parole officers.  Oh, shit.  Who the...  Jimmy, don't say shit like...  Come on.  That was Bob Kelly who just called in with that comment.  Yeah.  Good morning.  Did you get in trouble?  I'm noticing that you're...  Did you get in trouble for something?  You think he's toned down?  What's wrong with you?  Wow.  This is toned down, Nick?  No, no, no.  Nick is saying like this...  Am I not on serious open Anthony show?  What's going on?  We're treating this like it's fucking AM 77.  Wait a second.  No.  Every time he'll say something, he goes... 
[02:05:30]  Oh, I backpedal a little bit, you mean?  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Did you get in some kind of trouble?  Not really.  I mean...  Something happened.  Something happened.  All right.  Let's get into this.  Nick never said a little...  No, I didn't.  This one happened.  A little...  Hey, that's Bobby.  That's Bobby.  That's what I'm saying.  Oh, Patrice.  He got in trouble by someone.  Yeah, let's go.  Someone's calling you, Patrice.  Oh.  Fuck, man.  Shut that off, will you?  I'm trying.  I'm going to shut it off now, dude.  I'm sorry.  It's good.  I like you.  Are you calling Jimmy?  No.  You were fucking with him.  This is what it sounds like at the Red Lobster on a Thursday night. 
[02:06:00]  Goddamn phones going off.  Yeah.  Parking out.  Looks like an Escalade dealership.  Was that you who said that, Nick?  That was Nick DiPaolo, yeah.  That was Nick DiPaolo?  Here's another one.  Patrice, when did we lose the Red Lobsters?  What year did that happen?  Because I remember going to the Red Lobsters.  I remember being on broadcast white trash on Long Island.  We lost the Red Lobsters.  Well, I still am.  I went once.  And by the way, I'm a big opponent of that shitty place.  Yeah.  We went there for...  Opponent. 
[02:06:30]  Let's go to fucking...  Let's go to Red Lobster and fucking have something.  It's a shit...  Anybody happy about going to the Red Lobster is a fucking asshole.  I went for the first time on the road.  I got a lobster tail.  It was the size of my thumb.  I go, it says Red Lobster, so it should be Red Scorpion.  That thing was like a half ounce.  It's the fucking tiniest thing I ever seen.  You got to make sure the lobsters are big if you're at Red Lobster.  I had crabs bigger than this in college. 
[02:07:00]  And they're shrimp?  No, it's the food.  It's really the worst shrimp.  It's bad food.  I'm sorry about it.  I can't...  They were a sponsor, man.  In this corporate world, Red Lobster, man, it's embarrassing how people go.  There's a Red Lobster on 42nd.  And, uh, Neil, my girl works over by there, and fucking that Red Lobster is a line around  the corner.  People are just stupid.  Mediocrity sells.  Oh, it really does.  Subway sandwich shops. 
[02:07:30]  Have you ever had a real submarine sandwich from an actual hero sub shop?  It's like, why not go to a deli and get a real one?  Subway, they don't weigh their meat at a real...  They're not all pre-sliced and shit.  They weigh it.  It's like cocaine.  Ooh, two and a half ounces.  And it's shiny.  You ever see the turkey?  You could snort a cup of it.  It's slimy.  Yeah, it's slimy.  It's sweating.  Yeah, there's a shine to it.  You go to a real deli, you cut the fucking shit right there in front of you, how thick 
[02:08:00]  or thin you want it, and put it on a real fucking roll or something.  Not this bullshit.  We grew up in, well, you must have, right, in Maldon and Medford, there was a sub shop  in every corner.  Yep.  You go in, they put seven pounds of roast beef.  Now it's all corporate places.  Giant fucking meat.  Nobody with a Coke scale on the back.  Why the fuck won't corporate people decide to do good things?  I agree.  Why does corporate have to always be terrible?  Why can't a corporate guy go put more...  Like, you know a corporate company that's doing this weird thing where they're trying 
[02:08:30]  to do better?  They're trying dominoes.  It's dominoes.  They're like, show us your picture.  Oh shit, the cheese is stuck to the top of the box.  This is bullshit.  I've fixed this motherfucking cheese.  Like dominoes is...  You know what, though?  It worked, because I was amazed by that commercial.  Show us your shitty dominoes pizza.  Yeah, that's pretty ballsy, actually.  That was pretty fucking ballsy.  What Mexican brought you this?  I sent them a picture, though.  I took a... 
[02:09:00]  You know, I got a pizza and I took a...  I let my dog poop in the middle of it.  I opened the box.  Look what it is!  Exactly.  Then they show a German and Japanese customer enjoying it.  I ordered the scat and pineapple.  But that's what I would tell you.  Do you ever watch Undercover Boss?  I want to.  Every week I want to watch that show and I forget.  Of course you do.  Another excuse to make fun of the white boss.  That's all that is.  That's all that is.  Have you seen it? 
[02:09:30]  Yes, I have.  That's all it's about.  You're not making fun of a white boss.  What are you talking about?  Of course it is.  You don't understand who runs television.  If you listen to Nick enough, you think this is the plight of the white man.  It ain't.  Shut the fuck up.  Nick.  Hold on, Patrice.  Hold on.  The boss, right?  You are so naive about who runs Hollywood.  The boss.  The boss.  The boss.  Goes out.  And it's a simple show.  It's not to make fun of the...  It's to go out and see his company.  Yeah.  And see what the fuck they're doing at the company.  They got some shitty motherfuckers that he goes with. 
[02:10:00]  You know what?  He's right.  I'm a fire at the end of the show.  And there's some people you feel bad for.  But at the end of the day, he's the boss.  Sometimes the boss goes, this is interesting.  I'm going to have to look into how fucked up my company is.  And then in the show, it's not like the white boss...  No, it's not the white boss.  It's not making fun of the white boss.  No.  Now, let's hear Nick's side.  I got exactly...  You got to know...  I can't.  It's too fucking involved.  You got to know who runs Hollywood, okay?  They hate the corporate fucking world. 
[02:10:30]  It's ultra-liberal people.  And the boss is all...  Everybody hates the corporate world, Nick.  No, they don't.  No, they don't.  You love the corporate world?  I don't hate the corporate world.  I drove here today in a fucking car made by a corporation.  The tires were made by a big corporation.  I like corporations.  What kind of fucking double horse shit talking about?  See, you're buying it.  They're brainwashing you.  I got to drive a fucking car.  Do I like what they do at GM so my shitty car can work out?  That's a corporation.  But you don't like the corporation.  They go after the power structure.  The people that run Hollywood go after the power structure, which is white corporate guys. 
[02:11:00]  It's just another way of going...  Hollywood is a power structure.  I know, but it's not the same.  Their politics are different, Patricia.  Don't see that.  Really?  They go after the corporate when...  Jesus Christ, yes.  ...when you see a movie and somebody has a Coca-Cola...  Whoops.  ...and they go, oh boy, am I fucking thirsty.  Are you thirsty, Al Pacino?  Like, it's just...  It's fucking...  That part of it...  It's all corporate.  Ah, boy.  I'm going to have to fucking...  All right.  All of it.  Forget it.  You'll never understand.  Nobody will fucking listen to the plight of the white man. 
[02:11:30]  No one.  It's not the plight of the white man.  It's corporate.  It's a boss who owns his own shitty company who's working for it and no one knows it's  him.  The point is that the guy in power is the bad guy and the fucking...  He is!  And the guy...  No, he's not, you fucking idiot.  Who's the bad guy?  He gave those idiots a job, didn't he?  Here's fucking...  Anybody ever get a job from a poor person?  His minimum wage?  Anybody?  Here's what happens in that fucking thing.  Yeah, we'll let you run the company, Patrice.  Wait, the boss...  The boss goes...  The boss goes...  Oh, man. 
[02:12:00]  I spilled coffee on my jeans.  God damn it.  That means it's a good day for you, Nick.  That fucking corporate...  Hot coffee...  That's right.  Let me get this straight, because I've never seen the show.  Starbucks just burned my lap.  The boss of a company...  Undercover.  Of a company, it plays the part of an employee...  Yeah, just to show he doesn't know what he's doing.  ...of different levels of his company.  And we're supposed to laugh, because the guy that owns...  Wait a minute, how much does he come off looking like he owns a company that doesn't even know how to work it?  He doesn't know what he's doing.  That's the message.  He doesn't...  He doesn't need to. 
[02:12:30]  Look it.  Slave owners didn't need to know how to pick cotton.  Oh, shit.  They just did it.  He's a guy who started a company with his brain.  Like the kid from Facebook.  They don't point that out, though, do they?  And the inner bullshit of the company just had an idea.  And he made money.  But I'm saying, this guy needs to know how to make chicken.  What he does...  Patrice?  Wait a minute.  What he does is like he goes to fucking...  They had one, the White Castle guy.  Okay.  And it was just, he would see the efficiency of his company. 
[02:13:00]  So he was playing the part of what?  A registered guy or a cook or something?  And he would have a lady, right, that goes...  That'd get there like five minutes early.  And she'd be talking to him and he's like, I got to get in five minutes early because  this other guy gets here ten minutes early.  I don't want to lose my fucking job.  It's a...  It's a...  Of course you have to manipulate it so it has human parts.  But it's never the boss is just going woogity-woog.  It's him trying to do his job that he doesn't need to do.  Does he ever look bumbling?  And not every guy that owns a business, the head of it, had an idea. 
[02:13:30]  A lot of them started at the bottom and worked their way up like Dave Thomas and became  the boss for a reason.  20-hour work days.  Where did Dave Thomas work his way up from?  What are you talking about?  He started behind the counter at fast food places.  Don't people wonder why this new employee is being driven up in a limo and a fucking  camera crew is following him?  Yeah, exactly.  The new guy is somebody.  Oh, yeah.  What's the...  Did you watch it?  Yeah, how did they explain the camera crew?  No, but I think the desire to make fun of the boss is pretty...  Yes, it's just a power thing.  I think that's something... 
[02:14:00]  I agree.  I wouldn't say...  I think everybody has that desire just to let, like...  I just don't see too many black bosses being made of fun on that show.  How did they explain...  Exactly.  Patrice, how did they explain the camera crew?  And I know what you're going to say.  They don't...  Oh, there's no...  There's like...  They set them up.  They probably call it like a...  Documentary or something?  Like some kind of thing where it's like that, but it's the boss around and then...  Man, how stupid are these people?  It's revealed.  But look...  That's the point.  Cameras in their face, their whole fucking show.  I'm sure some of them are hidden.  So it's a good fucking show, though.  Don't be fucking screaming at anybody.  You don't know who they are.  It's a fun show to watch because, look, yesterday, my phone was fucked up all day. 
[02:14:30]  And I'm calling AT&T and I'm telling...  Something's going on corporate-wise.  The woman gets on the phone and goes, hello, my name is Jennifer.  This is...  But will you please...  And then do you live at that?  But I go, miss...  I don't want to interfere with whatever your training is.  But you sound like a fucking automated computer.  She's reading it.  Yeah.  She's reading it.  I always stop those people immediately.  Let's stop that.  I let my wife do that shit.  This is the problem.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  But my point to even say that is they're teaching something in corporate.  You can't be happy with how corporate thinks.  It's impossible.  There's no way...  She's got to be a little happy with the fact that she's working.  You know?  Yeah, maybe.  But her job is not safe because if they're teaching...  The reason she's not fired...  I mean, you go shopping all the time or whatever.  Like I said, there's only one teller now.  You go on a Saturday, it's one teller and the rest is this automated thing.  Once they can figure out how to completely eliminate the human element... 
[02:15:30]  Well, yeah.  You're fired.  Of course.  They're well on their way to doing that as far as banks going.  They don't...  You know, they don't want...  Eventually, there will all be banks.  It'll all be done.  And then, you know, they can rip you off easier that way.  Seriously.  But that's what I'm saying.  So when you see something that adds a little human touch...  And I'm always giving these motherfucking speeches.  I'm like, why are you behaving like this?  You cost your company money.  I make it money.  So ultimately, you're useless. 
[02:16:00]  If you're going to just...  Like some of the arguments are just based on what the computer says.  So once they can figure out how to...  The computer to answer any fucking thing...  They use that as an excuse now.  It's always when...  You're right.  When they call and they can't answer something.  Yeah.  It's like, well, we don't have that in our computer.  They always blame the fucking technology.  People are making themselves useless.  But they have to make money, corporations.  The bottom line is the bottom line in a corporation.  That's why...  Yeah, that's...  When you get an argument, there's no logic involved.  You're right.  But it's all...  That's why Subway sandwiches, they weigh their fucking meat. 
[02:16:30]  But why?  Because they figure out the profit margin.  Right.  I understand.  That's what I'm saying.  That's the problem.  That's always going to be there with a business.  If you make $70 billion as a corporation...  I hear you.  You can't make $40?  Like, you can't...  Oh, take it easy, Obama.  No, you can't.  If you can make $70, make $70.  That's right.  You would be, too.  Because you don't know if in two more years...  You can make a couple hundred grand, Patrice.  You can make $140 this year.  It is.  You don't know in two years you could be making $10 or $5 billion.  That's right.  In a shithole.  Some other technology comes up.  Your piece of shit. 
[02:17:00]  And now you're supposed to be like, well, at least I gave some money away and...  No, not give it away, but you just...  We're halfway decent.  Not nickels.  But they would look at that...  I agree with you.  But they would look at that like it's not indecent to be computerized like that.  They would look at it as it's efficient and better servicing the customer.  Even though I agree with you.  I hate them.  No.  But that's how they would look at it.  That's right.  You know, we're trying to service the customer.  So we read through this thing.  Everybody gets the same service.  They would look at it as we also have, as opposed to 20 years ago, 5 million customers 
[02:17:30]  where 20 years ago we didn't have that.  Yeah, yeah.  It was a lot easier to handle.  There's an amazing demand for customer service, too.  It'd be nice to have some humanity.  I agree.  Of course it ain't happening.  I agree.  No, it's going the other way.  That's what I mean.  It's completely going the other way.  There are some instances I love not dealing with people.  When shit works, we're like a credit card company where it's like, oh, we have a problem.  You know, was there a charge done here?  And you call up.  You never have to talk to somebody.  Right.  You punch in numbers.  Your last thing was this at such and such a place. 
[02:18:00]  This.  You push yes.  Okay.  Thank you.  Good.  I didn't talk to one fucking idiot.  And a computer sounds so funny when it's asking about a website.  It goes, sheet mail.  Strokers.  And you're like, LOL to yourself.  It was a Tuesday night.  Yes, that was my purchase.  When I say fucking corporate, too, I don't mean, I don't mean like, oh, I mean, the things  that they represent.  I mean, the thing like, you know, like the oil company represents, which is not to say 
[02:18:30]  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  We apologize for destroying some of the planet.  It's a bunch of he did it.  He did it.  We have to fire all these guys.  It's just sorry, man.  Made a bad mistake.  Could you imagine?  Made a bad mistake, man.  A human.  A human.  But that's not enough to say sorry on TV where they were saying we're cleaning up.  We're doing everything we can.  You know, the black lady that was like, yeah, yeah.  Well, we have to put an answer in mind to make everybody feel better.  I live down here.  We lose it.  And then the oil. 
[02:19:00]  And then have some Popeye's chicken.  I was having some gumbo one night.  I live down here and I work for BP and we ain't going nowhere.  Yeah.  White people go.  We know that.  You're not going anywhere.  Very obvious.  The commercials these days are really getting to the point of being unrealistic.  It's frightening.  I've been preaching it since what?  My first CD 15 years ago.  Yes, yes.  There's one about Kodak Cameron.  Call what?  Call what?  I'll be the same angry white boy 15 years later. 
[02:19:30]  That's right.  Sorry, I'm ahead of the curve.  I was ahead of the curve.  Nick started this shit.  Sorry, I just started with Nick the Power.  It was white presidents until fucking now, Nick.  Who was you fucking pissed off about?  What are you talking about?  What are we talking about here now?  I'm just talking.  You call me Obama for some reason.  Well, you're upset that somebody could make 70 zillion dollars.  Obama has become like a marketing thing where now every company is like, well, since we  have a black president, let's get black people in every commercial.  Why not?  Why not? 
[02:20:00]  Because it's not representative.  It's only going to last four years.  But it's not representative of a lot of what's going on.  They showed a white man taking an order from a black man on a commercial.  I've talked about it before.  Any alarm company commercial.  That's how they fucking hear.  It's the bad white guy.  Yeah.  The bad white guy that's coming in the house.  And it's the black guy at the sub station.  Redundancy.  Can we send some help?  It's not any white actor.  They found the white...  Apparently, Ed Begley Jr. is not getting his checks from St. Elsewhere. 
[02:20:30]  So now he's resorted to cat burgling.  You know what?  How are you supposed to sell Vipers if Ed Begley Jr. is not fucking ripping off your car?  And the thing about that commercial is you could make it race neutral.  You could put a ski mask on the fucking criminal.  Nobody would know.  Yeah, you'd know, though.  But then you complain about that.  Give me your motherfucking money.  Who would know?  Oh, it's him.  And the eyes give it away.  I like the dumb guy.  And the grape soda in the hand.  Sorry.  I like the dumb guy at the party.  And they all leave. 
[02:21:00]  And he's like the cute guy.  And he knocks on the back door.  And she starts to come to the door.  And he breaks the back window.  It's like she would have opened the fucking door for this guy.  She was all hot for him and shit.  There's a lot of white criminals.  Yeah, here's the...  But they work for BP.  They're not breaking it up.  That's the advantage of the...  It's a phony self-flagellation.  Because it's fucking...  It is people who are in charge poking fun at themselves.  Because it's like if you poke fun at black people,  these elitist white people are going, 
[02:21:30]  Well, you can't because they really are the underclass.  So let's poke fun at ourselves.  It's a phony self-flagellation.  Nick, I know Nick has seen this one  and probably been as infuriated as me.  The three...  Jungle fever.  Oh, sorry.  The three dumbest white people ever.  The three dumbest white people.  Opie, Anthony, Jimmy.  Yes.  Was he angry at the end of Roots?  No.  The Roots.  Holy fuck.  Why would he run, though?  You got a job to do.  All of a sudden, he's running away. 
[02:22:00]  There's three dumb white people  toiling over what aspirin's to buy.  Sandy Duncan's thirsty to get her a drink.  They're sitting there going,  This one, I gotta take...  How many pills?  I don't know.  I got a headache.  I can't do that.  And this smartly dressed black woman  with a well-cropped afro comes over  right to where she goes.  She goes,  Hmm, I need this.  Advil.  One pill all day and walks away.  And all the white people looking at her like,  How did she do this?  Of course they don't know.  She was the maid.  Wait a minute.  You can't have fucking dumb white people 
[02:22:30]  that don't know on purpose.  That's not the purpose, Patrice.  It's done on purpose.  It's done with a purpose.  Like, let's make sure the black woman  is the smart one.  That is my point.  The people who...  As opposed to what, though?  As opposed to having a black woman  and a white guy standing there going,  I don't know what the fuck to buy.  And a Chinese person coming over going,  Oh, I've been going.  You know what?  But I think, let's be honest,  this is why I'm going to let you guys  have it after this. 
[02:23:00]  Oh, shit.  I don't...  It's impossible to argue race  with white people for this reason.  White people think racism  is only niggas, dogs, hoses, lynching,  and fucking slavery.  Racism.  If you can hide that, right?  You think that it doesn't exist.  That's following you around in the stores.  That was a list of...  But let's...  But what I'm saying...  Anthony's ten favorite things.  That's right.  That's what I'm saying.  So what I'm saying, Anthony, is this.  Yes, sir.  You see the other scenario you set up?  How come it couldn't be a white guy, 
[02:23:30]  a black woman confused,  and then a Chinese guy?  Yeah.  The part that I would have trouble  getting the truth out of most white people  is that they would have problems  with the Chinese guy, too.  That's so much bullshit.  If it's not white,  just like what people say...  Depending on what the product was.  Just like what people say,  if there's a BET,  if there was a white...  Every other channel  is white entertainment.  They just call it other letters.  You make up 14% of the population.  If you watch TV  and you're from another...  What the fuck?  You...  No, first of all...  Let me finish.  You're Italian, Nick. 
[02:24:00]  You keep saying that.  You fucking...  So what?  It's just...  I'm English, too.  And fucking Louis C.K.,  he's Mexican.  You're an immigrant.  He's an immigrant.  But you took white.  You fucking took a color.  Now, if everybody else  band together with a color...  What are you talking about?  My mother's side is from England,  so that doesn't count?  She's English.  She's not a fucking white person.  Why does my Italian  override my whiteness?  Why is your English  and your fucking Italian override...  Why does your whiteness  override your fucking nationality? 
[02:24:30]  I know I check white on applications  for things I...  You're a BML.  I'm called...  You're a fucking Italian.  I'm a white European male.  I'm a white European male.  I don't believe this thing  about his English.  He except Italian.  I don't ever hear Nick going,  boy, I love fucking  goddamn cabbage.  He's fucking...  He takes...  I love fucking Italian.  Cabbage and potatoes.  He's a blue-blooded Italian  fucking hootity-dootity  Sopranos guy.  Fuck you.  And you're another Italian.  But I'm saying,  you band together  to be this color  that's oppressive. 
[02:25:00]  It's not oppressive.  It's an oppressive color.  What?  I'm pointing out things  I'm seeing happening  that is disproportionate.  Thank you.  It is not realistic.  A lot of times  I see things that are not...  And it's white people...  Not indicative of what I see  in society.  It's not realistic  to your society.  They're portraying people  of varying races  in ways that are...  It's not realistic.  It's actually...  Like what?  It's gone so far.  Like a fucking black pill lady?  Like a home invasion  in a fucking alarm commercial.  It should be a black guy. 
[02:25:30]  Because...  And you know that,  Patrice.  You're for the truth.  There's a disproportionate...  Patrice said that's fair enough.  That's causing home invasion.  That's fair enough.  I'm just saying...  I am not afraid  of white guys...  But...  White guy busting your door in.  It better be fucking...  It's probably because  he's found something  that belongs to you  and he's returning it.  He found money in the driveway  and he's bringing it back.  Here's another one.  Kick your door in  to bring back your lawnmower.  It's your neighbor.  There's one for insurance now.  There's a white kid  standing on a hill 
[02:26:00]  trying to take a picture  with a black...  He's bumbling.  And he falls down the hill.  Rolls down the hill.  And the black couple  are looking down laughing at him.  I've seen that.  You think that's an accident,  you dumb fuck?  I've grew up with that  for years.  Yeah?  There's nothing but  bumbling, white boys.  It's all bumbling.  And it's white people  writing it.  It's white liberals  doing it to other white people.  But that's how you know  it's not an oppressive thing.  It's a phony self-flagellation.  That's right.  I never said it was  black people  taking over television.  They see, look,  they see Obama got elected. 
[02:26:30]  They say,  now we just got to put  black people  in every commercial.  That's just not true.  That's been going on for...  Hold on.  For a long time.  There's a book.  Not true.  Not true.  It's in writing.  It's been legislated.  Not the bell curve.  Came out,  I think,  Paid with Good Intentions  by Jared Taylor.  It's right in there.  It's written into law.  You have to represent  black people in commercials.  It's a law.  Is it a law?  I'll find the book.  If it wasn't a law,  then we'd have fucking...  Baloney.  You'd have plenty of black...  We'd have Kentucky Fried Chicken 
[02:27:00]  commercials  with no black people in it.  It'd just be white people enjoying it.  You've got every  McDonald's commercial now.  Do you realize you only see  a black McDonald's commercial now?  And it's a white commercial  on BET  during a BET  where they have a jazz  where they have a...  It's only on black channels  where they have the jazz...  Welcome to the sound of  the new McRib.  Oh, man.  Hey, baby.  Do you need a...  I had a handker  for breakfast biscuit. 
[02:27:30]  How about you?  I ain't got a problem.  It's always a white girl.  It's always a Midwestern white girl  with a nice peaches  and cream complexion  working behind the counter  at McDonald's.  And the black people coming...  That's not how I've been seeing it.  At the airport  it's some jaded chick  with cornrows and queens  going,  get your apple pie yourself,  motherfucker.  That was Nick.  That was me.  Your goddamn wife was me.  Or your peach pie.  Oh, Chip. 
[02:28:00]  Time to take a break.  Hey, you know something, though?  The thing about  the black home invasion guy?  Yeah.  The white home invasion guy?  Yeah.  There are places  where a white guy  would home invade,  but the way that  the commercial...  Bizarro world.  The way that  that commercial  you don't believe  where is this  beautiful suburban home  and this lady  and then there's  a white guy  tiptoeing around.  But there are places  where there are  some poor crackers  that are busting  your fucking house.  Patrice, I say that. 
[02:28:30]  But for every one  white guy that does,  there's about 400  black and brown people  kicking in front of us.  That's not true.  Okay, 360.  Okay, 245.  But you know what?  No, Patrice,  this is why I don't agree.  Because you know  why it's being done.  Even though,  you're right,  there are white home invasion guys.  Of course.  You know they're doing it.  You're talking about  the context of the commercial.  You understand.  The reasoning behind it.  The reasoning behind it.  And you can't win the argument.  Hold on.  You can't win the argument  in court  because it's phony.  It's unrealistic.  It's phony.  When the fuck  did TV become real? 
[02:29:00]  Hey, you gave us that one  a few minutes ago.  Now you're going back  and you're going back.  It's unrealistic for a...  The home invasion thing,  you gave us that one  a few minutes ago.  It's unrealistic for a reason.  It's all horse shit, really.  It's unrealistic for a reason.  I'm scared of a nigga  cutting my throat  out of my mouth.  Yeah, underlying fear  and guilt.  It's there for that reason.  You gotta...  The people that don't understand  the people who write this shit  and produce it in Hollywood,  movies, TV, sitcoms, commercial,  you have to know  what their agenda is  and what their politics is. 
[02:29:30]  And it's ultra-fucking-liberal.  It taints everything they make.  Okay?  Exactly.  So that's all you need to know.  It doesn't matter  at the end of the day  if it's a corporation.  It's still a liberal agenda  being pushed, okay?  It doesn't matter  if the commercials  are a corporate McDonald's.  They still make money  at the end of the day.  You're a white guy  without a fucking TV show, man.  I don't understand that shit.  That's what bugs me for.  What are you talking about?  I'm fucking like you.  I'm brutally honest.  You're a black guy  who's not a movie star.  That's more fucking incomprehensible.  In this day and age,  what are you doing wrong?  It's only two. 
[02:30:00]  Jesus, my janitor  in my high school  has got a sitcom for Christmas.  It's only two.  What?  Did you see Big Lake?  Were you in that?  Did you see Big Lake?  Did you play the lake?  What is it?  Big Lake?  What is that?  Why did somebody's finger  hit that car crash?  If this iced tea was hot,  I'd have to throw it in his face.  I don't know.  What is Big Lake?  It's a Comedy Central show.  Oh, yeah.  They wanted me to write on it.  And it just proves racism.  Really?  It's so bad  that no black person 
[02:30:30]  could have a show  that bad on television.  Really?  No, none.  Ever.  Could never.  What's Big Lake about?  Oh, you'll have to fucking  just watch it.  See it for yourself?  You'll be embarrassed.  It's about a lake  that gets polluted  by white corporations.  As they pump in  all their waste.  It would be better  if it was that.  That's a better idea.  I just, look,  before we take a break,  I just want to see  some commercials  where a white guy  helps with pills  actually tells  a black person  what to do.  It just gives them  an idea  that the black guy 
[02:31:00]  goes,  wow, hey, thanks.  Exactly.  Exactly.  The white guy  had a good idea.  But you know what?  Patrice is right, though.  It's always,  TV's always been phony.  The fucking,  the mom cooking the cake,  you know,  they don't show  the fucking husband  beating her.  Yeah, but that wasn't phony  because it was a white lady.  No, no, no, no.  But I'm saying,  now it's just  phony racially.  It's always been phony,  but now it's just phony racially.  It's always been slanted  culturally to the left.  But it's the reason behind it.  I don't give a fuck.  As long as people  were honest about  the reason behind it.  I understand why  the fucking bumbling  white guy's 
[02:31:30]  falling off the mountain  as the black couple's  chuckling in their  fucking beautifully  dressed suits  and everything like that.  I understand.  Why does beautifully  dressed suits,  why do you have  to have your sarcasm?  That whole scene  is done for a reason.  It makes you sick  because you're white.  They should be purple  with little hats.  It makes me sick  because for me,  I go,  what is this condescending  bullshit?  Shove down my throat.  How about that  commercial for the new  fucking rock band?  Where that white chick  with the braces  kisses the black guy  and then he's wearing  the braces.  Huh?  That doesn't happen. 
[02:32:00]  No, it should be  blown up.  Will you just be  I don't want to see it,  Anthony.  Here's what my  Just admit that it bothers you  I don't like interracial  or a gut level.  Yeah, just admit it.  What the fuck?  That doesn't even bother me.  For Christ's sake.  I jerk off to it.  Who the fuck  Patrice, you're so wrong  about that, man.  Who the fuck notices  this much shit  about commercials?  It's shoving this  fucking issue.  Well, it's a fucking  liberal agenda  and it's worked  and that's how  Obama got elected.  And it keeps going  and going and going.  White guilt.  So now white guilt's over 
[02:32:30]  just in the four years  that he's going to be.  Obama got elected  because the fucking  the dumb Republicans  picked Sarah Palin.  Obama's going to be gone.  Okay.  So now it's like  in two more years.  It wasn't just four years.  It's been a work in progress  for 40 years.  Now white guilt  is now  all of a sudden  now it's gone.  Can I just say something?  Oh my God.  The white guilt  is gone now.  I hope so.  Seriously.  Not white guilt is gone.  What do you mean  four years?  White honesty  is now coming back. 
[02:33:00]  Let me explain something  to Patrice.  That's right.  Let me explain.  The real  white people  are coming.  There was a guy  named Allen Ginsberg.  A real left-wing radical.  I'm too tired  to go into this.  I'm really the most  well-read guy  on this subject.  I know Ginsberg is.  I want to learn.  He did gigs with him.  Go ahead.  No, he said 
[02:33:30]  in the 60s.  Okay.  He said  we'll get your children  meaning we're going  to invade the institutions  televisions  fucking college campuses  and they did  for the last 40 years.  It's been a liberal  fucking agenda  and it's brainwashed  fucking white people  and white kids  and generations of them  and the white  fucking guilt  paid off  when Obama came along.  You understand?  It's just simple.  It's true as that.  Eat ass.  Come on.  You know I'm right.  You can eat ass.  Oh, you're right. 
[02:34:00]  Because you said  it was patch out  of the debate  that phooey  eat ass.  Back to you, Nick.  He said phooey.  College campuses  are run by conservatives.  You're right, Patrice.  At least fucking  Hollywood's run by conservatives.  You're right.  At least Nick is honest  about his nonsense.  He's not nonsense.  Don't try to minimize  what I say.  I'm going to marginalize it.  He said minimize.  But I'm saying  that these white people  with this stuff  that all of a sudden  is this new 
[02:34:30]  white people  widening their eyes  is nothing but  white people  getting permission  to be what  they really want to be.  See, he's saying  we're racist.  You're racist.  Black people  are the most racist  people on the earth.  So fucking what?  We should be flying planes  into your fucking house.  You already did.  That's what the fuck  we should be doing.  But we're not.  We walk around  happy as a motherfucker.  Happy?  What this country  Look it.  What the fuck  did black people do?  After we come back  you tell me  what the fuck we did  to get still treated 
[02:35:00]  this fucked up  never did anything.  Save that.  To you motherfuckers.  That's another hour  easily.  Save that.  I can't.  Hold on.  I don't like this.  Let's get it.  One day he would have been  for saying that out loud.  Slavery.  Slavery.  Jim Crow.  There you go.  Fucking civil rights.  And then yesterday  I wasn't getting hung.  Yesterday.  And motherfucking  white people  talking about  Black.  Do you just  shut the fuck up.  White people  are fucking racist.  And you have done 
[02:35:30]  more okay  to make up  for those  slavery and all  that other.  In the last 20 years  you've taken more  out of this fucking  country between  court costs  fucking welfare  reparations.  We've paid you  we've paid you  a job.  We've paid you  back 40 fold.  We who?  Italians?  You got here  two days ago.  I'm a white European  male.  Who fucking  helped put the  lamp on the  Statue of the  Liberty?  That's what the  fuck you did  for this country.  Fucking nothing.  Thanks for spaghetti.  Thanks for spaghetti  motherfucker.  We appreciate it. 
[02:36:00]  I'm English too  by the way.  Thanks for olive oil.  And thanks for  fried Mars bars  from England.  Thank you.  And you gave us  the club.  Thank you very much.  And you gave us  the club.  Yes.  Thank you.  That's the thing  that goes on your  steering wheel.  That's a good line.  Dudley Moore would  hate that joke.  Thanks.  Thanks for the  ragu and the  nice hats.  Well you can  always leave if  you don't like it  here.  And boy I'll tell  you.  And you can leave  too.  I am happy here.  If it's too many  niggas.  Let the 14% run 
[02:36:30]  wild.  Hooga booga.  With our fucking  bones in our nose  and eat everybody.  Shut the fuck up.  Why are you  sickening me with  your orange juice?  There aren't too  many blacks.  There are not.  300 million racers  walking around.  See that's it.  That's what they're  doing.  They can't win the  argument.  You gotta throw  all your crap.  Oh really?  That's all you do.  You've been making  really wise things.  Shut the fuck up.  No you haven't.  Look how crazy you  are right now.  Because it's  you can't  I hit the nail  on the head.  I hit the nail  on the head. 
[02:37:00]  You hit the  nigga with a  fucking plunger.  That's what you  did.  You shot that  nigga 41 times.  Don't use that  word.  We're gonna get  in trouble.  That might be  the best show  I've ever been  a part of.  By the way I'm at  Foxwoods.  Yeah let's do  this Nick.  Go ahead.  Big plug for  Foxwoods this  weekend.  Foxwoods tonight  Friday night  Saturday night  for tickets  comics  C-O-M-I-X  at Foxwoods.com  or  1-800-200-2882  and  Saturday night  come up  Let's get a lot  of people at 
[02:37:30]  Nick's fucking  show.  It should be  great.  He's filming a  DVD.  We gotta fill up  the joint for  Nick.  What exactly  is the  taping?  Is it one  taping?  Two tapings?  Two.  On Saturday  so both shows  filled up?  So you gotta  wear the same  shit?  You got two  of everything  though?  No I don't  actually.  I was gonna wear  a different shirt  just to screw up  one man  in a red shirt  and then the  punchline  I'm in a  tuxedo.  That would be  honest at least.  And Patrice  at Bananas this  weekend right?  Hasbrook Heights  New Jersey.  I'm not gonna  make a joke  about that. 
[02:38:00]  Friday and  Saturday night  for Patrice  O'Neill.  What's the  question as we  go on a break  that we're  gonna answer  after the break?  What?  Seriously.  What has  black people  done to this  country to get  treated so poorly?  I agree Patrice.  You were pulled  over here  against your will.  This is the  Opie and  Anthony show.  Opie and  Anthony.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  There is no  you.  There is only  me.  There is no  you.  There is only 
[02:38:30]  me.  There is no  fucking you.  There is only  me.  There is no  fucking you.  There is only  me.  Opie and  Anthony with  Patrice O'Neill  and fucking  Nick Dapala  today.  These guys  have given us  amazing radio.  Let's not  forget Nick  Dapala  filming that  big DVD in  Foxwoods this  weekend starting  tonight Thursday  Friday and  Saturday.  You want to  sell all the  shows out not  just the DVD  taping.  Especially  Saturday.  Especially  Saturday? 
[02:39:00]  Okay.  But yeah I  mean sure.  Why wouldn't  you go see  Nick Dapala at  Foxwoods?  That's a great  time.  Because I  voted for  Obama and I  wouldn't put up  with his shit.  That's why.  I'm a close  minded twat.  I think once  you get a  certain age  you lose a  little potency.  I feel it  leaving.  I feel I  don't have  the fight in  you.  No.  Just that  made my head  light.  I got a  bright spot  in my eye.  touch your  diabetes. 
[02:39:30]  Really.  But I can  hear Nick.  Nick is a  kind of  gentler.  He still  has his  Nickness.  But you  can feel  a gentler  Nick Dapala.  Nick has to  take a nap  after.  Nick could  do this.  Nick used  to be able  to fucking  do that  all day  today and  tomorrow.  And then  eat but  still do it  while he was  eating.  He's stuck  at a plane  actually.  Is he the  aging athlete?  Yeah.  He's able to  do it but  he needs a  down time.  He needs a 
[02:40:00]  racial reconstruction.  You can hear it.  He's still  scoring 30  points but he  needs like a  four hour nap  afterwards.  You know what  Nick needs?  It's like a  protege.  And that's the  same thing with  me.  You just go  oh.  You need a  little positive  reinforcement is  what you need.  And here's the  deal.  I'd like to get  a radio show  Terrestrial but  I come on here  and I say this  shit.  It goes on the  internet.  It's in  perpetuity  forever.  They can go 
[02:40:30]  Google me now  if I go to get  a job at a  legitimate and  go oh he  called Patrice  a black  and I'm  hung for  good.  So fuck  everybody.  Completely  out of context.  Exactly.  So you know  what?  Nick has never  used the word  it's nigga.  I'm fucking  with you Nick.  Do you see what  happened?  Do you see  if this was  roots Nick is  close to changing  his name.  Wow.  To fucking  Toby.  Really?  But I'm not  disrespecting.  That's a horrible  thing to say.  Wait a minute.  It's not disrespecting. 
[02:41:00]  I'm master mower  till I die.  This coming from  raw foods George.  I was getting  ready to say that  about me.  We weren't  talking about  cauliflower earlier.  Chicken.  My fucking  I'm telling you  my back hurts.  Chicken wings  George.  Yes.  Hey.  My chicken fingers  George.  My back hurts.  I'm close to  going OK.  I'm not even  going to argue  the point.  Fuck my name  is Toby.  Because they  beat you down.  It's that athlete  thing.  I feel like I  got to go in  for Jim Crow 
[02:41:30]  shoulder surgery.  You were  waiting 10 minutes  to say that.  Jesus.  All right.  What's the  question?  I forgot already.  Oh we are all  done.  We're done.  He's right.  You know what  he's right.  I couldn't argue  another half.  It is exhausting.  It's just  we're done.  That's what those  people do to you.  There's some  you mean the  radio.  In my city we  would keep it in  their neighborhoods.  We got a hot  blonde on TV and  do them locally.  What the fuck  is she doing?  That's a Fox girl.  That's you know. 
[02:42:00]  Courtney.  She's pregnant.  She's pregnant  obviously.  Yeah.  She's much harder  than that.  She looks good.  You should see  when she's not  she go Google  her man.  They got her  in bikinis on  if you Google  her.  A girl like that  I'd be happy  to knock up  just by throwing  my cum at her.  These jerseys.  That fucking  Snooki is  disgusting.  I don't get it.  I don't get it  her pussy is fat  after a shower  she probably  has a nice pussy.  Everything on her  is fat.  She's a little  fire plug. 
[02:42:30]  Yuck.  Disgusting.  I find Snooki  to be sexy  in this broad  you're talking  about on TV.  Really?  Get the fuck out of here.  No but that  broad on TV  that's as bad  as she can look.  Snooki has a little  pig.  She's a little  pig.  I like little pigs.  She is a little  pig.  Snooki is a better  fuck than the girl  on Fox.  She's a nice girl.  Google her.  No she's a  I'm telling you.  There's nothing  sensual about her.  You don't want to  kiss this lady  a whole lot.  Yeah I do.  She got veneers.  She fucked up  her teeth.  She got veneers  and now her mouth 
[02:43:00]  is open.  But Google her  and look at her.  Those little thin  baloney lips  like what are you  going to do  with her?  Thin baloney lips.  They're a mess.  She's a mess.  What do you want  to kiss a big  mouth bass?  Sometimes.  Sometimes.  Did you check out  rent is too high?  Rent is too damn  high guy?  Who's that?  Jimmy McMillan.  He's everywhere.  Jimmy McMillan is the  karate expert guy.  He's the candidate  for governor.  Yeah and he's  paying $800  himself.  Now they're saying  he's rent free  for 10 years.  He's rent free  for 10 years.  That's the latest. 
[02:43:30]  That's the new one.  But you don't have  to be paying high rent.  He told the paper  $800.  You don't have to be  paying high rent  to fight for other  people to not have  to pay it.  That's true.  Because no politician  is actually in the pickle  of the people  they're trying to help.  None of them are.  That was wrong.  The Post is trying  to fucking target  this guy because  they know that  they picked Cuomo.  It's amazing  that they're actually  the nerve of the Post  to endorse a fucking  endorse any newspaper  to endorse a candidate  and then fucking  write negative shit  about another one.  The nerve of any  of these motherfuckers.  That Dicker, 
[02:44:00]  that Fred Dicker,  that fucker.  He's the one  who went after  Palladino.  Is the mayor  an infinite amount  of times you can serve?  I do.  I love him.  No, it used to be  until faggot Bloomberg  changed it back.  It was two terms.  Koch had three  and then it went to two.  Dinkins served one.  Rudy served two.  And he wanted to serve  a third after 9-11  and guys like Bloomberg  were like,  no, no, no.  The process must carry on.  And then Bloomberg  fights to get  a third one for himself.  Yes.  Cock sucker.  He's been around 
[02:44:30]  way longer  than fucking eight years.  It's been around 2001?  It'll be his 12th year  after he's done.  So that's three terms.  Yes, exactly.  I just said that.  He spent a hundred million  to be the mayor.  How the fuck is that fair?  So is it going to go  four terms?  Is it infinite now?  It's just three.  I think it's three.  He's done.  Unless he goes,  I want another one.  I'm reading the icons.  Is he a beloved mayor  of this guy?  No.  He did one good thing  and that was calorie counts.  Because I like the fact  that the companies  didn't put them up.  The rest of his stuff is shit.  He just did that yesterday. 
[02:45:00]  That guy's a liberal ass.  Yeah, he is.  He couldn't eat on the  Republican.  Putting in on every other state  for their gun laws.  I think he's a goo gobbler, too.  Yeah.  A lot of people  have speculated that.  But I have a goo gobbler.  A goo gobbler.  A goo gobbler.  He's a fucking goo gobbler.  Oh, shit.  We have a terrible budget gap  and the bad news is  I had to close five firehouses.  But the good news is  you can stay at my place, fellas.  You can stay at my place. 
[02:45:30]  I like the bike paths.  A fucking goo gobbler.  It's the same fucking mayor, too,  that after they find a bomb  in Times Square,  he goes,  who knows who it could be?  It could be somebody  unhappy with health care reform.  Exactly.  You fucking blithering idiot.  That's the kind of  malicious guy, I bet.  That's where he really  fucking did it for me.  Yeah, it's not a Muslim.  No.  No.  It's a white guy  unhappy with health care reform.  It's a guy from Applebee's  who got thrown out.  What a fucking funny asshole he is.  Can I make a fucking  public apology 
[02:46:00]  to Nick DiPaolo, please?  Yeah, go ahead, Patrice.  Nick, I'm sorry  if I for any second said  that she got beat  out of being Nick.  When with such naturalness,  he goes goo-goblin' mayor.  The mayor's a goo-goblin' mayor.  I think he's a goo-goblin'  Oh, yeah.  That's a phrase.  Jesus Christ almighty.  Fucking Nick.  I love this show  because I got the computer  screen in front of you  and I'm reading your icons. 
[02:46:30]  Don't read the icons.  Camel Puss.  Balls and Ass.  Hitler.  It's something.  They're all Danny.  Yeah, he has to change us.  I love this show.  When you're not here,  that's where we go.  Camel Puss.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, Bloomberg is a  fucking asshole.  Socially, he is, yeah.  I think he's a phony.  He really is a nanny, isn't he?  He's a nanny, he's trying to get...  Salt and cigarettes and...  Yeah, that and...  What the fuck is that?  And then just trotting around 
[02:47:00]  from state to state  that he has nothing to do with  as this mayor for...  to get illegal guns off the street.  And meanwhile, by doing that,  he's legislating against  legal gun owners.  He's trotting around.  Trotting around.  He's trotting around gobbling goo.  He's skipping.  He's skipping.  Gobbling goo trotting.  Yeah.  Trotting around goo-goblin' mayor.  But New York City!  What the fuck is it?  I feel like my life's in danger right now. 
[02:47:30]  I'm rotting.  I don't even know if you can say that.  I just want to join in, too.  Just fucking...  But it's just like...  I don't know if you can say that  in the year 2010.  Everybody's getting tickets  this fucking week.  No kidding.  I'm not parking on this.  I'm just going to fucking  stay in the house.  When I leave here,  I get a feeling I'm going to go  to the parking garage.  There's going to be a boot  on all four wheels.  He's on a computer right now  tracking my garden.  How do you spend  a hundred million  to get elected  and a guy who might be  better off...  Well, because he has five billion dollars.  I mean, how is that allowed?  How is it allowed?  The people allow it. 
[02:48:00]  Well, that's freedom of speech, man.  It's like a fucking...  I don't have a problem with that.  He could spend his money.  But that's why we're getting  shitty candidates  who have only that interest in mind.  I know, but...  Because they're the ones  who can afford to run.  But I don't want the guy  that picks up my trash  running either.  No, no, no.  But people don't look at Obama  as...  Obama's an elitist.  Like, people don't think  because he's black  that he can be  an intellectual elitist.  He's a snob.  He's like all those guys.  He's no different.  That's the white side of him.  I love how this was going  to be change  and not business as usual. 
[02:48:30]  And what's he doing?  He's thrown away  working as the president  to campaign  for all of his friends  around the fucking country.  That's called  business as fucking usual.  He's a Harvard elitist.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I mean,  white people have done this for you.  Don't be so sad.  That's a very good point.  But his whole point...  It really is.  His whole point is  business as usual.  He's right.  But his whole point was  I hate him  with the fucking president.  Change.  When you have change  behind you,  that's a big line.  But you know what,  the president has no power 
[02:49:00]  to change anything.  What president?  He can veto.  Sure he does.  Change is nothing.  But you know what?  Not that much.  Well, he kind of got  Nicky Barnes arrested.  Barnes!  For that incident in Vietnam?  No, Nicky Barnes,  the heroine kingpin  for the cover story  that on the Sunday  New York Times Magazine,  Mr. Untouchable.  Sergeant Barnes.  No, the other Sergeant Barnes  was good.  Wow, did we just ruin  this conversation?  I started destroying it  and you hopped right on.  My apologies. 
[02:49:30]  I was afraid to chime in  and I had no idea  what was going on.  We could talk about  the gooch.  Bob Guccione dead.  What?  What do you do with that?  Yeah, he died.  Oh, you don't know?  Last night.  Yeah, cancer.  79, Dallas, Texas.  It's a shame.  Son of a gun.  There's a lot worse  ways to die  than Dallas.  You like Penthouse  over Playboy, Nick?  We were discussing it.  I don't look at that  shit anymore.  Growing up,  I used to National Geographic,  the lady carrying  wood on her head  with the saggy black dits.  That's what I used  to get off to.  Growing up was huge.  That's that little kid 
[02:50:00]  from fucking...  Who is that?  Little Miss Sunshine?  No, that's the  Little Miss Sunshine kid.  Yeah, Abigail Breslin.  Yeah, you can tell.  She's got a couple of years.  She's got a face  on like a corpse.  Oh, she looks like  a fucking humble.  That's a horrible face.  Humble.  He's right.  No features.  Nice skin.  I'm just putting  what white people like  and don't...  I look at her.  It's not all white people.  I don't like her.  I'm looking at her going...  She's horrible.  But I thought you guys  were going to go,  oh, oh.  I was thinking youth.  No, no, I'm just  thinking Mike,  I'm a man. 
[02:50:30]  He's thinking young.  Kirsten Dunst  with her teeth  that come out of her face.  Snaggletooth.  I never get that one either.  I don't get it.  Don't get it.  I don't get that one either.  That's what I'm saying.  Or Reese Witherspoon.  I don't get it.  I get her,  but she doesn't do anything.  I don't...  Reese Witherspoon.  I will just to prove  that I'm not so racist.  I'll give you my top three  sexiest white women  of all time.  Oh, shit.  Helen Thomas.  Three.  Number three.  Phyllis Shaffley.  Adrienne Barbeau. 
[02:51:00]  Wow.  All right.  Oh, I love her.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  She's like the big titties.  She was sexy, though.  Only because she fucked  a guy on your level.  Amy Smart.  Amy Smart.  Amy Smart.  The one who was kidnapped?  The New Hampshire girl.  Yeah, the sexy.  I don't know who the other one is.  And Joan Benet Ramsey.  Amy Smart.  Joan Benet Ramsey.  She's from a bunch of movies.  No, you're thinking  Amy Smart was New Hampshire.  She had her husband killed, right?  No, no, no.  Now, there's an Amy Smart actress.  Amy Smart, who was in Hangover.  No.  Oh, I'm thinking of Elizabeth Smart. 
[02:51:30]  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you're thinking of Elizabeth.  I'm sorry.  Who's cute, by the way?  The Transporter.  She played the...  Have you seen The Transporter?  Megan Fox?  Not The Transporter.  You know if you saw her.  Exactly.  I'm serious.  What's the one where he had to live...  Helen Reddy?  Yeah, yeah.  He had to live to...  Shane?  That one with the fucking heart.  Adrenaline.  Adrenaline.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That's Jason Statham.  Whatever.  His shitty movies.  Crank?  There you go.  Speed, slow down.  I'll get a fucking run.  Quick, fly.  She's pretty hot.  And number one is Janet from Three's Company.  Shut up. 
[02:52:00]  Are you kidding me?  Choice the witch?  Come on.  See, that's another way of just being mean.  You don't mean that.  That's his way of saying,  white woman ain't that hot.  That's all he's doing.  And Janet from Three's Company.  She was sexy.  You have a type.  Janet?  You're doing a bit.  You have a type as far as white women go.  That's a bit.  Yeah, mediocre type.  Mediocre.  What he's saying is,  these mediocre bros are the best you can do in the white.  Amy Smart's pretty fucking hot.  Get the fuck down.  Adrian Barbeau didn't do anything for him.  She had big fat tits.  Who's number one for real?  I'll give you my three-top black woman.  She got a bullet in her head in a creep show.  The problem is, though, 
[02:52:30]  I'll tell you that I think fucking Carly Simon's hot, too.  Really?  With that steam shovel jaw?  Big mouth, yeah.  I'm going to give you my three-top black woman.  Esther Roll.  Shirley Hemphill.  Shirley Hemphill.  And Mabel King before the legs went fucking caboolie.  Well, that's where we part ways.  Can you put Precious in there, Nick, please?  Yeah, Precious.  There you go.  Precious's mom.  She's so talented.  Let's overlook her obesity.  Get the fuck out of here.  Thank you for saying that, Nick.  You know how I've been nailed with the label 
[02:53:00]  that I don't find any black women attractive?  And we've been through a bunch of them.  I don't either, really.  That's not a racist thing.  I found one, actually a couple in one video.  That motherfucking CeeLo fuck you video,  which is hysterically funny,  has like hot girls in it.  Can we get that on the...  There's like hot...  So obscure nigglets.  Give me a fucking hot black woman.  And don't say Halle Berry. 
[02:53:30]  She's a black woman.  I think Halle Berry is a fucking man.  Let me tell you something.  No, she's sexy, dude.  She is not.  She's an aging fucking...  I know you didn't approve of Joyce DeWitt.  That was not a joke?  No.  That's not a joke.  I tried Janet from Three's Company to be sexy.  Back when she was Janet.  Wow.  That's rough.  But look, I've proven that I give white women a look  and I give them respect for being what I think they are.  Why are you really busting a stereotype apart?  Naming three of the most mediocre ones.  What I'm saying?  But Suzanne Somers, I know she's a sexy woman. 
[02:54:00]  Like, okay.  Give us some black women.  I'll give you a black woman.  We should think it.  And after this, the three...  And I find a lot of the Bond girls to be gorgeous.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I find a lot of those girls to be beautiful.  Give us your top three black women.  We're going to look at it right now on the screen.  My top three black women that you would know?  Yeah.  I like a lot of those big video girls and I like porn stars, but...  Mainstream shit.  Zoy Saldana's a pretty girl. 
[02:54:30]  All right, slow down.  Slow down.  We're going to look her up.  No, he's going to look up the chicks that I actually think are...  Hold on.  These are the chicks that Ant likes.  Now, go forward to the...  I think the high school years and then the college years, girl.  It's kind of hot.  She's kind of...  Not these singers.  Not these.  Why?  She doesn't sing...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  They just showed a 12-year-old.  Keep going.  No, no, that's not how it is.  He's growing up.  Oh, okay.  See, and then when you get to this...  Okay. 
[02:55:00]  Now, the chick that's sitting at the table...  All right, hold on.  We're almost there.  Is...  Great song, by the way.  It's kind of hot.  I don't know.  What are they filming?  Is it Johnny Rockets?  It looks like it, right?  Now, look at the chick to the left.  Wow.  She's very cute.  That chick is fucking hot.  And then you see a little more of her and stuff.  I kind of like the one on the right.  With the glasses.  I like the one on the right.  Believe me.  There's nothing wrong with her either.  And it's just enough white.  She's half Chinese, too.  You think?  That's why.  She's not all black. 
[02:55:30]  I need a little half Chinese.  Yeah, you need it mixed with half white.  Well, the next one for the college years, too, is hot.  He means black women like the ones fucking Fishburne was dating in school days.  Yeah, these girls are barely black.  Yeah.  Well, that's the key.  No black people are actually all black these days.  There's a lot of fucking masters tiptoeing in the fucking...  In the hot squirt off.  They're goo.  They're goo.  They're gobbling goo. 
[02:56:00]  What was the fucking...  Goo gobbler?  Goo gobbler.  Jesus.  Where's the other check?  All right, the college years.  Here we go.  No, it's not her.  But she's hot.  I'll give you my number one black woman in there.  That's right.  Man, turn this boy's shit off.  Yeah, never that.  We've got to find Anthony's obscure nigglets.  She ain't bad.  But then...  They're all pretty hot out there.  They're video chicks.  Yeah.  I'm not big on the chocolate myself.  Now, wait, wait.  Watch this girl.  You guys are amazing, man.  No, why?  You fucking said Joyce DeWitt. 
[02:56:30]  Give me a break.  Yeah.  Why can't Joyce DeWitt be fucking fly?  I don't think there's a white guy alive that would put her in his top.  I guarantee you'll get some hot.  That chick's hot.  Yeah, she's hot.  There's nothing wrong with that girl.  Two-thirds white.  The chick who played Sunshine in fucking Harlem Nights.  Very sexy black woman.  That's a black chick.  I'll give you my favorite black chick of all the time.  Who's the hottest black chick?  I'll tell you who it is.  Let's go with this.  Thelma from Good Times.  Yeah, she was a ghetto.  Thelma.  She was a ghetto.  And I will say...  Stole that playboy.  I'll give you credit. 
[02:57:00]  She was sexy.  Yes.  I loved her.  Stole that playboy.  Thelma from Good Times.  Also Shaka Khan, too.  But I was saying white woman.  Shaka Khan.  Young Shaka Khan.  How about this, bro?  Oh, Stacey Dash is in...  She's phenomenal.  Holy shit.  She's 43 years old, man.  She's got a tan, for Christ's sake.  She's not even black.  Yeah, she's barely black, Patricia.  I've dated darker Italian girls.  Is she like the daughter from fucking Lethal Weapon?  Is that her?  Holy shit.  No, that's not black.  You call that black?  She's 10% black, though.  That's not black.  My sister's a darker.  She's like Miley Cyrus.  Get out of here. 
[02:57:30]  Every girl looks like that now.  You don't get no fucking African girls no more.  You don't want?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  Good God.  Is that real?  Look at those notes.  Is that real?  Are you shitting me?  How old is she there, Patrice?  What do you guess?  She's 43 now.  These are 43-year-old pics we're looking at?  No.  I don't know if she's that age now.  I mean, she's that in this picture.  But she's 43 now, and she looks the same.  She's got a little doo-doo hanging out of that picture.  That'd be funny.  That's the point.  Just a turd sticking out.  Wouldn't scare me at all.  Just the head sticking out, looking around. 
[02:58:00]  Push it back in with your tongue.  Fucking fucking Jesus.  Four girls in one cup, nigga.  I wouldn't give a fuck.  Like a Manx cat with a little shit tail sticking out.  Doesn't matter.  And you flick your tongue on it.  There's too many to speak of, though.  There's too many seconds.  Give me a couple more.  But Thelma from Good Times is absolutely...  She was dark.  Me too, man.  But she was like, if you ask any black man who's the one, it's Thelma from Good Times.  And that came from me, Patrice.  That's why I give you credit, because Thelma's a black girl.  She's black.  She was ghetto.  She's like official.  That body... 
[02:58:30]  I'd put that body against...  I was a teenager, and I was wearing it up.  Thelma Starr's wife is one of the best-looking women.  She was in James Bond.  Yeah.  I've never seen her in my life.  Yeah.  I think she's the number one Bond girl that ever lived.  Yeah.  That was a good one.  She's gorgeous.  Yeah.  Gorgeous white woman.  I like the mother on Everybody Loves Raymond, too.  Helen Thomas.  What's her name?  Helen Mother.  Y'all really got upset with that one from...  I mean, with Joyce DeWitt.  That doesn't make sense.  It's a silly choice.  I don't even think black guys would put that in the top three.  He's just busting a ball.  White guys certainly would.  I think black guys...  Look at this shit.  I don't get tired. 
[02:59:00]  What's the matter?  Look at her nose.  She looks like an aging clown.  Why would you show the picture where she looks like Michael Jackson's nose?  She looks like Skeletor.  Right.  What happened?  Why does the worst joke ever?  What happened to her nose?  She fucked her nose.  Is that cocaine, you think?  She'd fall asleep on a panini maker?  Look at her hair.  Is that her there, too?  I'm a fucking old bitch.  Oh, she's awful.  Holy shit.  I won from three's company.  You sure you didn't mean Mrs. Roper?  Yeah, I was going to say. 
[02:59:30]  Exactly, Jimmy.  Holy shit.  You guys are pieces of shit.  I'm telling you, she's the same.  I'm going to fuck John Sox.  Look at her.  Look up the fucking sexy picture, you piece of shit.  You're not going to win anyone over this.  She's dumb looking.  She sucks.  Did you like her ass, Patrice?  She wouldn't even be in my top thousand.  She's beautiful.  Top thousand.  Look at her.  No fucking way.  She looks like a Russian cab driver in that picture.  Fucking messy hair and a tank top.  Patrice, you've got the Google images in front of you.  You pick out a picture where she's fucking hot.  I'm going to show you something.  Yeah.  You like her body picture? 
[03:00:00]  We're on the eighth page.  We're really rocking through these pages.  We're back to her baby pictures.  She used to wear these jeans, man.  Oh, really?  She used to look good in jeans.  Jawdash.  You lost me, Patrice.  She just fucking...  Look, Danny's trying every combination to find a hot picture.  Who else you like?  Barbara Billingsley?  You motherfuckers, man.  God rest her soul, Mrs. Cleaver.  And I thought the...  That's not a bad body, though.  And I thought the second...  Was that her?  The second...  The second blonde.  The second Cindy was... 
[03:00:30]  The second Suzanne Somers.  She was a porn star, right?  The middle...  That was the real middle girl.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  There was a tall, goofy one I thought she was sexy, too.  She was a porn star, I suppose.  The fuck was the other one's name?  Maybe.  Patrice, we're trying.  Maybe it was...  I was little.  You're losing.  All right.  Fucking...  What's that?  What's that picture?  What the hell is her name?  What's that one?  Jenny Lee Harrison?  You know who was sexy also?  Is that the blonde?  No, it was another one.  Valerie Bertinelli.  Yes.  Looked just like my first girlfriend.  Way better than Joyce DeWitt.  All right. 
[03:01:00]  We'll go with Valerie Bertinelli.  But I'm bumping up...  I'm bumping up...  Adrian Barbeau to one.  Adrian Barbeau.  Let's go old school.  I want to see a picture of Adrian Barbeau.  Adrian Barbeau.  She was unbelievable.  She was fucking ridiculous.  Natural tits, by the way.  How high was she getting shot and escaped from New York?  Oh, my God.  Did you like her in Maud?  Where'd she get run over?  The Maud years?  She had ridiculous heavy...  She had those giant natural tits.  Natural tits.  They were just heavy.  And look at that.  She was hot.  But that fucking face, she's a wreck.  She's as not pretty as fucking Joyce DeWitt.  It was the heavy... 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, she was kind of pretty in her head.  Look at her big fucking heavy tits.  I don't know if she's...  What the fuck is going on in that picture, Danny?  I don't hire something.  Oh, shit.  Look at those.  Shit.  Look at those.  And that's why...  If Janet had a bunch of shit like that, with her tits out and her pussy cocked, you'd be  like, ooh, Janet.  But I'm...  If Janet had two things like that, tits, she doesn't...  Yeah, that's the point.  She had a fucking mullet.  Go to Amy Smart, too.  The only one in the top three that...  I mean, your top three is not that great, Patrice. 
[03:02:00]  I love Amy Smart.  That's his way of zinging us.  Don't you understand that?  You think Amy Smart, do you really give me that much credit?  He picked the three most mediocre white women.  That girl looks mediocre to you?  No, she's pretty hood.  She's a beautiful girl.  She's fine.  And you agree with Adrienne Barbeau.  A little bit.  You know?  A little bit.  No, but you threw Andrew Witt to fuck us up.  No, I liked it.  And the Barbeau was all about the tits, not the face, so...  I like the girl in the Three Stooges, the blonde that used to get hit with a monkey wrench  in the face.  You know what I'm talking about?  Your top three sucks.  It really was not good. 
[03:02:30]  Dorothy Hamill was in my top ten.  Old hands, lovebirds.  Dorothy Hamill I was in love with.  Dorothy Hamill?  When I was 14?  Yeah.  I skipped baseball practice.  I faked an injury to watch her skate on fucking water.  Did you, uh...  I had a TV guide I saved.  White women that white guys go crazy over, I don't find to be that attractive.  Like, I like white women that have, like, something else going on.  Patricia had an ass on her.  Patricia, who do you think we go crazy for as white guys?  Yeah, yeah, that's a good question. 
[03:03:00]  Who do you think we go crazy over?  Dorothy Stilham.  Oh, I'll tell you, I'll tell you a fucking high-level white bitch.  Uh-huh.  I don't get.  Uh-huh.  That's what I was in love with it.  That's Megan Fox.  She has a nice body.  She's good.  She's smoking.  Exactly.  She's a smoking white woman.  She had a great volume of her face, too.  And she's naturally gorgeous.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She has an E.T. thumb.  There is something wrong with my ass.  Yeah, why get that?  Why get that, Patrice?  Yeah, I don't understand that picture at all.  She's sexy.  You're right.  Sorry, dude.  Who is there?  I know she's sexy, but I'm saying it does nothing. 
[03:03:30]  Why would you get it?  That does nothing.  Oh, you don't want to?  Oh, yeah.  You don't like that?  Whatever.  I mean, the sarcasm I get, but it does nothing for me.  Why?  I couldn't jerk off to that.  How about if she was hanging out with Jack Tripper?  I couldn't get a threesome with Joyce DeWitt.  And then you would spend more time with Joyce DeWitt.  I have a conversation with my boy, right?  He goes, is this girl pretty?  I go, eh.  And he goes, but would you fuck her?  I go, that has nothing to do with it. 
[03:04:00]  Of course.  Fucking Megan Fox, of course.  She's gorgeous.  Don't look at her thumb, though.  Her thumbs are all fucked up.  She's gorgeous to the eye, because beauty is what it is.  But she does nothing for me.  What's the matter with her thumb?  Who cares about her thumb?  I'd suck her thumbs and jerk off.  There's only one thing wrong with that thumb.  It's not up my ass.  I'm sorry.  She has toe thumbs.  What, did she get it, caught in a lathe?  I don't know what the fuck it is, man.  No, it's a toe thumb.  It's a weird...  What happened to her, right?  It's just a birth defect.  She doesn't have both thumbs.  It's some weird thumb.  I kind of have a... 
[03:04:30]  I'd say I wouldn't date her now.  She's just a white girl, man.  It's too close to home.  She can't even hitchhike to my house.  There's nothing...  All right, give us another one, Patrice.  There's nothing happening, dude.  Patrice, another one.  That probably you guys will go crazy over?  Well, you think white guys go crazy over that you don't get?  That will be anybody.  A lot.  Maybe a fox was in one.  I'll name one.  Maybe a fox is one.  Go ahead.  You know who I think is really smoking? 
[03:05:00]  The money girl.  Maria Bartiromo.  No kidding, really?  The money honey.  Yeah.  Maria Bartiromo.  You like the same...  I like that.  You just like that Barbie bone in the stomach kind of weird looking.  No, no.  Nick just picked one that's not that.  Exactly.  Why do you always got to generalize and paint with a broad brush?  I don't know.  You know who I never thought was hot?  He doesn't even refute it.  You know who I never thought was hot?  Pam Anderson.  Never fucking thought she would get it.  Oh my god, before she got her shit done, she was hot, man.  That's right.  Fake, blonde, fake dude. 
[03:05:30]  Anthony, you're right, though.  But when they discovered her...  She was ridiculously hot.  Oh my god.  Before she got the...  She fucked it up.  Freaked...  And the big lips.  And the big fucking fake rib.  Well, yeah, no, but she...  Have a look at her when she first got famous.  It was too plasticky, fakey.  No.  Not sexy.  Madeline Stowe was sexy.  Remember Madeline Stowe?  Shut up.  She was fucking sexy, man.  Yes.  Go with Pam Anderson before...  Madeline Stowe was fucking sexy.  When she was discovered.  N.B. Davis.  N.B. Davis.  They run together. 
[03:06:00]  Like, Hollywood doesn't let anybody but Megan Fox.  Like, it's a bunch of Megan Foxes out there.  What do you mean?  She's a brunette with beautiful eyes and beautiful skin.  She's a naturally gorgeous...  But they're all...  There's no ugly white women in Hollywood with ugly white famous...  No.  What are you talking about?  That dykey woman in Glee?  She gets every fucking role because she's got a cock?  What's that?  That's funny.  She's funny, though.  I know, but I'm just saying.  You said every white woman...  She's a fucking white man.  She's not in shit because she's fucking pretty.  She's funny.  She's fucking funny.  She's a funny broad, man. 
[03:06:30]  She really is.  She's terrific.  But she has to be.  Did you look at Nixon?  No, she doesn't.  She's in Hollywood.  She eats snatch.  That's all it takes.  Everybody in casting is gay.  How do you know she's a fucking dyke, then?  Oh, I don't know.  I see the outline of her cock and her pants.  Are you saying you've got to gobble the goo in Hollywood?  Yeah, and she does it.  It'll make me laugh all the show.  She likes fresh salmon steaks.  Look, I can't...  Where's these other girls?  These other Hollywood...  Well, the one Nick picked was totally different.  Yeah, but no one heard of that fucking girl.  What was she in?  She was huge.  She's in nothing.  She's still on TV.  Who are we talking about now? 
[03:07:00]  I'm lost.  The Money Honey.  Who is that?  Maria Baturama.  Will you please name a white girl that's in movies?  Almost like a Sophia Loren a little bit in your eyes.  Okay, put it this way.  There'll never be a fucking black...  She's getting older, though.  A black...  It always comes back to this.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  It always comes back.  It's never too far from you.  It always comes back to racism with you.  There'll never be a black...  There'll never be a black...  She's a shitty actress.  What's the girl from...  Guest at Anthony's house? 
[03:07:30]  Really?  The girl from Batman.  Pause it too much.  What?  Alicia Silverstein.  From Batman.  No.  Black?  This one.  Dark Knight.  Oh, oh.  Maggie Jiggle Jiggle.  There'll never be a black woman...  There'll never be a black woman passed off as that bitch.  Like, a black woman that looks that unsexy would never be passed off as the fucking...  They were shoving her down her throat like she's a hot blood.  She's not.  But that's what I'm saying.  Who?  That's what... 
[03:08:00]  That's why I get confused with you fucking people.  Here's what I'll give you.  She's not even hot.  I am sick of fucking Latifah being shoved down my throat like she's fucking hot.  Right.  And straight.  And straight, by the way.  Stop it.  Revlon commercials like she's a cover girl?  Right.  Fuck you.  No.  They always...  No, my pool girl.  Again, it's her politics.  Ivy League black woman.  Lesbian, by the way.  Like she would get the athlete in real life.  As a big black girl that's pretty.  But she's...  No. 
[03:08:30]  She's presented as a diva.  She's not a pretty woman.  She's to sell products to fat chicks, though.  She's not pretty.  She's telling...  Latifah's a pretty woman, man.  No, they're not.  They are presenting her as, look at this beautiful...  That's a pretty woman.  Not a big, beautiful woman.  No.  Right.  Just a beautiful...  But no, no, no.  But in Revlon, who?  Yeah, Scarlett Johansson.  Who is that?  Scarlett Johansson.  How about...  Hey, we're forgetting one.  Charlize Theron.  That's a pretty woman.  Yeah, yeah.  She's a fucking...  She's a pretty woman.  That's a pretty woman.  That's a pretty woman.  That's Shelly's Theron.  That is a pretty woman.  I met her on the Tonight Show.  Wait, Latifah?  Show the red picture, Danny. 
[03:09:00]  Latifah is always being shown as, like, a hot girl.  But she's a pretty woman, though.  She's not a pretty woman.  She's a pretty woman.  She's not a pretty woman.  What about Jada Pinkett Smith?  You like that?  You know what?  Vivian Fox.  I think Jada Pinkett Smith looked good in Matrix.  Look at...  See, that's her.  How is this a pretty woman?  Listen, man.  But this is...  Walk us through.  This is that disrespect.  She's a gay Ivy leaguer.  That's what they love about her.  Look at that.  Those tits and that face.  That's 20 years ago.  That's a fucking...  She don't look anywhere near that.  She got all the...  She's in the same category as the fucking bitch from... 
[03:09:30]  That's who you think's hot.  There you go.  There you go.  There's the true essence of her right there.  But you're not going to be able to find...  I'm going to go hot with a green piece, Joe.  You're not going to be able to find a picture of Scarlett Johansson with a brick sticking  out of her face.  You're going to be able to find it if you want to find an ugly picture of her.  Why are you getting mad?  I'm not getting mad.  I'm telling you that.  That's not hot.  Look.  Look at that.  Look at her saggy tits on vacation.  Damn.  She was sick in that picture.  What is that?  Tank Williams?  She was sick in that picture.  It's like Tank Williams on vacation.  Can you take the time to find some bad Scarlett Johansson pictures? 
[03:10:00]  It's almost impossible at this point in her life.  Another fucking disaster is the one that does the life from the Apollo and was in Precious.  What's her name?  Precious.  Monique?  Monique.  Don't fucking tell me Monique.  They're not in the same category.  Monique is brutal.  They're not in the same category.  Uh-huh.  Look at my dress, honey.  Look at my...  And everybody goes...  And she doesn't shave her legs.  And she's disgusting.  That's the type of political correctness we have to end before we're going to get anywhere  in this nation.  Of course.  Pick an ugly Scarlett Johansson pick.  Come on.  Which one do you want, Patrice? 
[03:10:30]  That's not Scarlett Johansson.  Let's be low-handed as hot.  On fucking method.  She's a piece of ass.  Period.  Scarlett Johansson.  See, they don't put a...  There you go.  You ain't gonna find one.  Where'd you go?  I'm telling you.  You ain't gonna find one.  There you go.  There you go.  Click that one.  There you go.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Come on.  Let's go.  Come on.  I love Scarlett Johansson.  Come on.  Oh, now it's not working.  Danny got an emergency text now to show the ugly fucking...  Fucking loading.  Fucking...  He's got 20,000 old...  It's the white man working against you.  We're not gonna load that bad section for the black man.  Fucking...  60. 
[03:11:00]  Emergency text.  Whoop.  It was loaded.  Every girl we've talked about in the last 10 minutes, Derek...  Derek Jede is fucked twice.  There you go.  Thank you.  Thank you.  That's not good.  But it's...  There you go.  Shut the fuck up.  I'm still fucking.  Wait a minute.  Can you just...  Can you just admit, though?  Everyone takes a bad photo.  That's a bad picture.  Well, why didn't someone say that when Latifah...  Because Latifah has 5,000 bad photos.  She's ugly.  She took one. 
[03:11:30]  It's the other way around.  You're Latifah.  She's always ugly, and they gussy her up for movies.  That's right.  That's right.  Wait a minute.  Does that picture of Scarlett Johansson not prove...  Danny, show the sweater picture.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute, though.  But does that not prove the same...  Is that ugly, Patrice?  Is that...  Of what?  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Wait a minute.  I'd look good in that outfit for Christmas.  Could you put it on, Nick?  I'll say you would.  Anthony, the fact that we've just seen that photo of Scarlett Johansson...  Yeah.  Isn't that the same fact for her, too?  Is that she's that, and you have to put makeup on and make her this? 
[03:12:00]  We had to search out one, and it took forever.  Find another one.  It was her in a Ralph's parking lot carrying tampons and a hat.  Yeah, because she fucking stays in the house.  Latifah goes out.  She didn't have tits like fucking retreads out on the highway.  I think Latifah's pretty.  Come on.  Latifah's pretty.  She's not pretty.  I do not pretty.  But you don't think any black women are pretty?  You haven't...  I said Vivian Fox for the Zillow video.  Wait.  You said Vivian Fox.  Vivica, actually.  You said Vivica. 
[03:12:30]  Show him Vivica Fox.  I said Jada Pinkett.  Show him Vivica.  You're right.  Show him Vivica.  I'll give you another nice black woman, Vanessa Williams.  In her day, yeah.  In her day.  Maybe.  She was pretty hot, though.  Is she...  Is this what I like?  And I like the maid from the Jeffersons.  I never liked Vivica that much.  Wow.  Florence Henderson was lovely.  Because she's black.  No, because she's ugly.  No, because she's not ugly.  No, I like Jada Pinkett Smith.  Because she's a baby.  She has a baby body, and she's light.  That's a bad Vivica Fox.  Yeah.  But see, I...  What, do I need a certain tone for them to be black?  Yeah, motor oil. 
[03:13:00]  You don't like black women.  You got to look like motor oil, according to Patrice.  No.  No.  You don't like black women in general.  No, no.  So you don't see the...  See, the fact that I can see...  I don't either, though.  I don't get turned on by black women.  The fact that I can look at Adrienne Barbeau...  Nothing for me.  Yeah.  And see something in Adrienne Barbeau.  Uh-huh.  Means that I have a fair eye.  You can't see Latifah and go, wow, she's a pretty woman.  Say you're racist again, Anthony.  No, no, because she's fat and ugly.  She's not a fat, ugly woman. 
[03:13:30]  Yeah, she is.  You're using the wrong woman to prove your point.  That Latifah is a rough one, man.  Hey, Danny, give me a favor.  I think that's rough for most black guys, too.  Bring up Takara.  T-O-C-A-R-A.  Danny's head is going to explode.  Make the same argument with a better-looking girl.  Takara.  Takara.  All right, let's go with Takara.  All right.  Click right there.  Find a black, black, black girl that is hot.  Let me see.  Can we...  She looks Asian.  Jesus.  Better than Latifah, but...  That's what I'm saying.  See, this is an unfair argument, because there's no...  No, I'm not...  You picked Queen Latifah. 
[03:14:00]  Nah, nah, nah.  This is...  But this is the same kind of chick, man.  She looks like Lena Horne.  She's a...  Is Lena Horne ugly?  No.  Nah, I didn't find Lena Horne attractive.  He said...  Do you hear this piece of shit?  He said, uh, please bring up Lena Horne.  I didn't find Lena Horne attractive.  This will prove your eyeballs are racist.  I'd rather fuck Mother Jefferson.  Really?  I'm sorry.  She was a pretty lady.  She's all right.  I didn't find Lena Horne.  There weren't as many sexy photos, because it was old school.  Let me see a picture of her.  Yeah, exactly.  Look at that.  Pictures back then.  Look at that fucking picture, man. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, all right.  Look, look, look.  That is a good picture of Lena Horne.  Yeah, it is.  Right there.  Yeah, there you go.  That's as racy as they got back then.  Show her what she looks like today.  They're, like, cleaning her oven.  Well, she looks dead today.  Oh, yeah, I know.  Lena Horne.  I didn't know that.  I meant that picture of Lena Horne.  Oh, when she's 97?  Oh, my God.  And she's still sexier than B. Arthur ever was.  B. Arthur is now on the look.  She was even a hot baby.  White women get haggard.  White women get haggard after 32.  First of all, that's a white man. 
[03:15:00]  B. Arthur.  White women start melting after 29.  B. Arthur is gay.  Let's be honest.  B. Arthur is gay.  Don't appear a gay woman.  Lena Horne was very pretty.  Hey, Nick's going to be at Foxwoods?  My favorite girl was Honka.  What?  Nick DiPaolo, Foxwoods, tonight, tomorrow, and Saturday, filming the DVD on Saturday night.  Nick DiPaolo at Foxwoods.  You've got to go and check out Nick.  800-200-2882 for tickets.  I'll go to Nick.com and click on something there that my web guy put up. 
[03:15:30]  I'm sure I'll take you right there.  All right, good.  I don't know.  And Patrice is at Bananas this weekend.  I'll be doing my surprise.  Let's not make a joke about it.  What are you taping?  At this place over in...  Oh, what is this about, Patrice?  Yeah, I'm taping my Comedy Central special.  I didn't fucking know that.  Well, I was trying to get it out.  If Nick shut the fuck up for a second.  Oh, about his racism.  If he stopped being racist for five seconds.  Why are you doing that?  No, I've been nice to you.  Nothing but nice to you the whole time.  I even pretended I like black women for this segment. 
[03:16:00]  Well, Patrice, it's November 5th, so you come back when it gets a little closer to really  popular.  But where is it?  It's at that Skirball Center.  Oh, here in the village.  The NYU place.  Yeah, it's fucking great.  I've been there for a million of you guys' tapings over the years.  Comedy Central taping for Patrice.  I taped the HBO thing there.  It's right on the corner of...  It's by Washington Square Park.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fucking great theater.  It's a fucking great theater.  It really is.  The Blacklist, NYC.com for tickets.  Or Big Mama Proz on Twitter. 
[03:16:30]  Are you guys going to be all right after this show?  Yeah, yeah.  Go see Nick.  He's taping his...  We did that.  Really?  Yeah.  How many cameras, Nick?  Three.  Three cameras, too.  Do you want me to get you a cab after the show?  Oh, motherfucker.  I just want to see how many cameras it was.  I was just making sure it wasn't more than my second camera show.  Well, I did one at the Wilbert Theater.  I did one at the Wilbert Theater, too, so I...  Just want to make sure.  It hasn't been released yet, so...  Why not?  I just...  Because I'm holding it.  They're afraid of me.  I say shit.  I talk on stage like I do to Patrice. 
[03:17:00]  Something happened to Nick.  You're right, Patrice.  The people that run Comedy Central just can't fucking handle that.  Something happened to him back, yeah.  A little bit.  Because his first album was...  I had three half hours.  That was the problem.  I burned more material than all of his.  I still feel the same as the last one starring Nick DeBottles.  I still feel the same.  That's a good fucking name.  No, it's called...  Something about...  Yeah.  What's the name of it?  I don't know yet.  It's going to be called...  Let me name it for you.  Jiggaboo Coon Hats.  What kind of...  You guys are implying I'm racist. 
[03:17:30]  I know.  When it's white honesty is what I bring to the stage.  I'm a racist.  I'm a realist.  It's called...  Here, white bum.  Here's a quarter.  Hey, nigger bum.  Die and eat my balls, you piece of shit, motherfucker.  That's a long title for a CD.  Yes.  It's a two-disc.  There's no room for a picture on the front of that CD.  Wait.  Here it is.  Wait.  Here it is.  Obama or shmama.  That's going to be called The Great Uniter.  Yes. 
[03:18:00]  That's not a bad name.  Oh, Dan.  That's great.  That's great. </pre>
