<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts discussing their controversial radio persona, mocking celebrities, and promoting their website featuring nudity and old show clips, including a humorous anecdote about a former intern faking an eye injury.  They then transitioned to the Super Bowl, a charity bet between the mayors of Boston and New York City involving clam chowder, and Britney Spears' hospitalization.  The conversation veered into their past comments about incest and the media's role in celebrity drama,  provoking numerous listener calls, some detailing personal experiences with incestuous relationships.  The hosts also discussed the New York Post's Obama endorsement, the misery index (with Detroit at the top), and their interest in serial killers. A significant portion focused on a listener's experience with a cousin and a discussion about paying for sex.  Jim Norton, a frequent contributor, was present throughout much of this segment.

The show then shifted to mocking poorly-made Super Bowl songs submitted by listener Dave Wellington, with harsh criticism of the singer, "Dinah Stay."  A psychologist caller, Lydia, claimed the songs were driving her depressed patients suicidal, leading to darkly humorous exchanges about her patients, including a deceased cross-dressing patient. More listener calls followed, interspersed with discussions about Jim Norton's film work with Kevin Smith (though not on set together), and Bob Kelly's detailed, sexually charged man-crush on Tom Brady, sparking a debate about the definition of "gay."  A news story about an Air Canada co-pilot's mid-flight breakdown was discussed at length, followed by a segment about the upcoming presidential election.  This included listener calls, discussion of endorsements (Oprah, Hulk Hogan, Arnold Schwarzenegger), audio of Hogan and Vince McMahon supporting Obama, and debate about the potential impact of an Obama presidency, with Anthony expressing significant concerns.

The next segment focused on the anticipated Black community reaction to Obama's candidacy, including frank and racially charged discussion about whether support would be based on race or policy. A caller predicted at least 75% of the Black vote for Obama.  Other topics included a bizarre news story about a paralyzed man whose pit bull ate his toes, a perceived suggestive interaction between female CNN anchors and a Black male newscaster ("reverse Oreo" joke), and significant complaints about SiriusXM's logistical problems, blaming "Don Wicklund" and "Buddy."  The mysterious disappearance of maraschino cherries was also heavily discussed.  Comedians Adam Ferrara and Russell Peters, and WWE wrestler/financial commentator JBL, appeared as guests. JBL promoted his energy drink, "MamaJuana," nicknamed "Boner Juice."

JBL's appearance continued into the next segment, recounting his firing from a previous job, his controversial act of telling children there was no Santa Claus, and wrestling injuries.  Brock Lesnar's UFC fight was discussed, along with Joe Rogan's commentary style. A significant portion featured a "boner juice" experiment on Pat Duffy, involving several women brought into the studio, resulting in sexually explicit conversation and comments about the women's bodies. Sandy Kane, a guest, recounted being raped by Richard Pryor and Sylvester Stallone.

The show then featured the "Cherry Darts" game sponsored by Bodoglife.net/poker, involving topless women, sexually explicit commentary, and blunt body critiques from Sandy Kane.  JBL and Russell Peters made brief appearances.  Sisters, one being 18 years old, participated.

The final segment featured an apology to Sandy Kane for an unspecified incident, acknowledging the hosts' error and using crude and offensive language, including a graphic statement wishing harm upon her.  They selected a "line of the day" containing vulgar language, mentioned a "bonus show," and said goodbye before transitioning to the next program, Ron and Fez.

[00:04:00]  just uh you will be out clear the room oh yeah yeah clear the room so jimmy very excited wanted to try  the cereal and he certainly has uh a gas problem as well i mean you hear the intro every day right  it's all about jimmy farting of course so it could it could get a little ugly in here uh anthony  great i'm thrilled uh by the way the first instant feedback of the day i would give the guy credit but 
[00:04:30]  he did it from his cell phone if you uh instant feedback from your cell phone throw your name in  there if you want credit he just writes morning brother man brother man it's the uh the catchphrase  of the new millennium i knew it didn't work in the old one save but i'm uh i'm a visionary because back  in 1996 i just knew brother man would catch on yeah and here we are it's happening it's it's happening  is it it's absolutely happening i didn't really see many people uh when i walk brother manning it 
[00:05:00]  you know what when i walk home every day i run into just just a handful of fans just a couple  little uh recognitions and then guess what i got a couple brother fans yesterday i don't think they  were doing it like because the catchphrase is catching on i think they were really mocking you  well they're gonna mock me but then when the t-shirts come out and the uh the coffee mugs and the  ice scrapers and the bumper stickers very good then it's gonna turn into the real thing you'll 
[00:05:30]  you'll see yeah everything old is new again is it i don't i don't know i'm not that confident on  that one you're not feeling brother man nah not really feeling brother man are you feeling mother  hucka no i wasn't feeling that one either that's a brother we's thing by the way and people like hey  that's a brother we's thing but see how it was being used yesterday i didn't want to give him  credit because it would it would mock him horribly right so i just said you know i picked up this this 
[00:06:00]  this saying mother hucka but when he does it it works when i did it i just sounded like a douche  so are you feeling mother hucka no no i'm not really feeling that one uh rest assured i wasn't  feeling any of the catchphrases that we heard yesterday yeah from 1996 what about pally  no i came up with pally i would use pally these days only in a purely sarcastic and uh demeaning  yeah manner yeah um by the way all our stuff is pretty much online we have a great website uh that 
[00:06:30]  we're not allowed to promote because god forbid there's uh there's a little nudity on it just a  little bit i could call that catastrophe and this is the sad part none of that hardcore action well  that would be good too to be completely honest with you but we don't have that it's just a little  nudity here and there and you know corporate policy you can't uh promote a website that has even just  the slightest bit of nudity and here's the here's the dilemma they're like well you clean up the website 
[00:07:00]  then you can promote it on your show and and this is what i say in the year 2008 it's impossible  to have a clean website it's impossible yeah it's all linked together it's called the internet  right because it's all intertwined so you really can get anywhere from any other site and they say  well a couple of clicks i forget the exact rules because you know they listen to every every word we  say every morning and then then got to hear about it later god forbid we're just saying crap to 
[00:07:30]  entertain people but i i think it's some weird rule where it can't even be like three or four clicks  remember what's the rule like three clicks or something yeah so even if we clean up our our website  entirely but if it within one or two clicks it's nudity it's still not good for corporate get to  horse gag from the disney website in three clicks right so just uh just take note that the website is 
[00:08:00]  uh is a good one i mean we've we've uh prided ourselves on on having a good uh you know show  website and it's named after our radio show all right and we have a nice new section called old  school opian anthony where we're putting uh old school video clips up and old school pictures up  like i'm looking at an old school picture of jimmy his head his head is in between two uh girls and  thongs oh i remember that one yeah and he's just very very happy you don't even see the girls you  just see their bottoms and you see jim norton's head in the middle of them and uh there's uh there's 
[00:08:30]  our old intern brian the intern who lied about uh not uh coming to work a few days and he came in with  an eye patch an eye patch and said that uh he got glass in his eye when a motorcycle hit his passenger  side his driver's side window yeah and it turned out we we interrogated him like uh like we were on  a detective show yeah oh did we pound him oh and he he he fell that under questioning oh boy did he  and then we had made him take the eye patch off live on the show and then he was like squinting 
[00:09:00]  going see the injury it's right and then he slowly opened his eye and was like all right you got me  he started it out saying that there was really a lot of scratching and everything underneath the  patch like he can't take it off because there's open wounds right uh all kinds of scratching of the  eye around the eye and then it slowly got where it wasn't all that bad and then when he took the  patch off we saw there was nothing he actually put a patch on his eye as a plan to uh yeah to make an 
[00:09:30]  excuse and there's nothing under it so if you haven't checked out our website in a while  dummy go check it out because we have this old school section and i mentioned it today because  uh us looking back at that old radio show from 12 years ago we're gonna throw up all those uh clips  aren't gonna throw up all right i know right we threw up yesterday you get to throw up when you hear  it for yourself but uh all that audio is gonna be up there uh i don't know later today or tomorrow  yeah that's actually the voyeur bus between those which one oh that is yeah i vaguely remember one of 
[00:10:00]  them was this girl melanie who was uh uh on the bus who i thought was the hottest thing was so  attracted to her and that's kind of how i remember that because i think i wanted to be by her heinie  i always found that weird because i thought she had really strange her it is yeah and you really  liked her all right her yeah okay oh well there you go you get to see it for yourself jim norton  actually on the voyeur bus that was for the arrest that's for the arrest jimmy and there's jimmy  getting his photo op uh in between the bus as they're bending over oh my god oh the good old 
[00:10:30]  you're so happy jimmy of course smiley boy and look at this hundreds and hundreds of people behind  jimmy as this picture is being taken all right let's say hi to chris in boston chris what's up  everyone's a smart ass you are a smart ass uh so what do you think uh the pats or what  yeah you're breaking up buddy call back he's uh all right we're we're gonna move on 
[00:11:00]  anyway uh superbowl right around the corner and uh it finally happened what we mocked this every  year and it has finally happened the news uh did a little story about the superbowl they have to do  this every year we've been waiting for this day and we finally got it here's the audio superbowl 42 
[00:11:30]  is getting political a tasty wager between boston and new york could help feed the homeless mayor  bloomberg and mayor menino of boston are putting their chowders on the table for sunday's matchup  between the giants and the patriots if the pats win bloomberg will send manhattan clan chowder to a  charity in boston if the giants win menino will provide soup kitchens in new york with new england clan  chowder oh i guess yeah i know i gotta stick with the manhattan clan chowder but i like the new england  it'd be cool if either whoever wins though both cities you know yeah and it's so nice that they're 
[00:12:00]  like sending the chowder to a soup kitchen it's it's it's a it's a it's a nice charity thing for  everybody that's gonna be my new charity it's me and mayor bloomberg we're here in the blimp  dropping a clam chowder on top of the homeless got the idea from three stupid radio jobs 
[00:12:30]  yeah it's kind of nice it's charity yeah yeah yeah you know in the end everyone gets chowder  do they am i gonna give chowder to the homeless all right all right you know i like i like manhattan  but sometimes i like new england clam chowder i like the new england give them a head shut up so 
[00:13:00]  there you go there's the big bet between the cities wow did they used to give it to the uh to a charity  or like huh what they used to do with it i kind of don't remember the charity angle no i think that's  kind of new this year it's a new twist i think they just kind of like would send you know like  a bin of apples or chowder yeah and then just let it rot there let it rot all like no one's gonna eat  it all right this was a good you know publicity thing and it was it was fun to do in the media but 
[00:13:30]  now what are we doing with this crap i hope they uh they send a news crew though to watch the homeless  eat some of this because there's nothing more fun than watching a homeless guy eating his uh food that  that he's getting from charity and going this is very good stuff because you know we get hungry  out here on the street right like just some where's my chowder yeah yeah some angry i want my chowder  i'm golden buns golden buns needs his chowder tippy times all right tippy times all right  you said i could get some chowder 
[00:14:00]  why can't they do something real man like kind of maybe send hookers to some miserable married guy  or i don't know i think it really might upset their political careers to be honest really  perhaps you're kidding me nothing affects mayor menino's political career i like uh i like the  idea of them giving the food to the homeless but like the real homeless not the auditioned homeless  that they show on uh tv oh they show the soup kitchens and things like that it's like you know 
[00:14:30]  they weed out the real lunatics for the new shot oh the casting call yeah the homeless casting call  is pretty much what it is right right they want um articulate homeless they want homeless that are  those uh families that fell through the cracks or the uh older guy that's a little down on his luck  we know that 99 of the homeless especially in new york are lunatics that belong  locked up in a rubber room they don't bolt they don't deserve chowder no they really just don't 
[00:15:00]  eat a central park rat right just sink your teeth into them yeah see all right instead of the hookers  yeah that's a little rough but how about uh new york sends rats and boston sends oh that's good  rats back i don't know whatever sealing plates from tunnels  uh wow in other news if you're just waking up uh britney was sent back to the hospital overnight 
[00:15:30]  oh my gosh because la la's what three hours behind us so you know it wasn't really overnight it was it  was uh it was like one two in the morning they uh they sent her back to the hospital i guess  for yeah for one of those 51 50s 51 50 remember when van halen put out 51 50 and we all got to  learn that that was uh that was code for for for what for uh for being dangerous to you and others 
[00:16:00]  or something like that yeah it's a big word but uh that's uh they got her back in the hospital on  a 51 50 so that's kind of breaking as we uh start our radio show today she went willingly blah blah  blah man she is a mess oh wow yeah she is a mess i remember uh thinking remember when justin timberlake  was dating britney spears yep and then all of a sudden out of nowhere he's like he he just went his  own way yeah and i started thinking he might be half a you know what because i'm thinking at the time 
[00:16:30]  why would you ever lighten the loafers i like to say i'm twinkle toes i'm thinking why would you  ever blow off britney spears especially back then when everyone was drooling over over her but he  obviously saw you know the signs early on that this uh this uh girl was a kook a nut yeah absolute kook  so he did the right thing back in the day nutty tendencies he probably has some stories he probably  have some stories but she was taken to the hospital because she uh would she freak out or 
[00:17:00]  or ah they're doing an intervention thing and i i think she's i guess she's has been treated  has been being treated or whatever by somebody for her bipolar disorder and her multiple personalities  and all the other crap's going on with her other day there was a picture of her just sitting on the  curb with her dog crying yeah well and she's screaming leave me alone but if you really study that  footage it was on tmz uh she went to the front gates of her you know fenced in yeah house so 
[00:17:30]  so they could get a nice shot and just sat there i'm sure there was other areas uh that she could  have went to to be by herself with her little doggy just wants the uh oh she loves the publicity loves  it they all love the attention i mean and they're starting to really call the celebrities out on this  attention thing tmz especially i mean we we talked to the main guy from tmz recently and i asked him i go  you know don't they work with the paparazzi a lot of these celebrities you know how do the how do 
[00:18:00]  the paparazzi know that these celebrities all of a sudden are showing up here and there and and harvey  explained to us he goes harvey there's only a few places in la that that you go if you want to you  know get your picture taken for the most part everywhere else you'll be left alone right right  paparazzi there right there's uh what it's called the ivy out there in la and there's a  a road called robertson that's really a hot place to be if you want to be seen and photographed by  the paparazzi so people like lindsey lohan and the rest they go there paparazzi starts you know uh 
[00:18:30]  taking pictures and then you as the celebrity you're like oh god leave me alone what are you doing  but you wouldn't be there in the first place right you know damn well that if you're in this area  that you're going to get your picture taken the whole business of being one of these hollywood uh  movie celebrities uh unless you're one of those mega celebrities like like tom cruise  uh the whole thing is i guess first and foremost is get work just you know getting a movie or 
[00:19:00]  something like that and secondly is getting your face out there that's part of your job  yeah as a celebrity is to have your face out there have your name in the paper  so why wouldn't they go to these places you know i probably have a publicist that hangs out and says  uh you know you need to get your face and name out there why don't we go eat here right where all  the paparazzi hang out for the most part when you see these celebrities you know shooing the cameras  and hitting the cameras and covering their faces and all that they know exactly what they're doing 
[00:19:30]  these celebrities very calculated it's extremely calculated i mean we've been to la if you want to  like if you want to be not recognized it's easy it's just easy it really is places to go  i need places to hide and go but if you show up at the places where the cameras are of course you're  going to be shot yeah you know but they're really they're really calling out lindsey lohan they're  like you know she's acting like oh god i'm such a big celebrity i can't live my life they're following  me everywhere and they're like no actually she's showing up where there's 20 to 30 freaking guys with 
[00:20:00]  cameras you know waiting for her she knows exactly what she's doing so all right we're just getting  started uh hey it's have sex with your cousin thursday what that's a week already where you  admitted that you wanted to have sex with your your first cousin um yeah that was a week that was a  week ago yeah in in hindsight now it seems like a silly thing to have brought up yeah it does right  but um yeah yeah i was young at the time you know it didn't carry over yeah i don't you don't have to 
[00:20:30]  do you see this cousin at family function still that rarely occasionally though i do  and what do you think yeah i probably still do it you're kidding right i'm teasing of course  but uh no it was back in the uh the old days the old when we were when we were kids you know  yeah when you were what 18 19 no it was like you know 15 15 it was like 15 i i guess yeah yeah

[00:22:00]  oh yeah hopefully it'll be up soon our phone number that's working 877-212-ONA  and tim just ran this into the studio  let's have sex with your cousin thursday  i had a crush on one of my cousins  oh no  sex with your cousin thursday  look at a cousin that had a nice ass and a good set on her  sex with your cousin thursday  it had nothing to do with love 
[00:22:30]  on the opie and anthony show  i love that dumb voice  goes right through you but i love it  yeah it's horrible  i absolutely love it  so uh the political thing is getting very interesting  you got uh what john edwards the big head  he has dropped out of the race  gone  he's out  he's not endorsing anybody yet  i think he's waiting  how  thinking he's gonna get a vice presidential nod  you think he would  no  there's no way  i don't know about that 
[00:23:00]  because if you have a uh a black male and a white female running  uh they may want to to to appease  just the white guy  oh yeah  white guy  but i what i was gonna say i think you gotta go older and whiter  oh maybe  yeah  but who though  basically i'm saying think republican  not not to get a republican obviously  but a democrat that kind of looks like a republican  a little older a little whiter  some of that hair missing  yeah a little uh gray  that would make a bunch of people out there a little more comfortable  just a little more comfortable to 
[00:23:30]  to vote for a woman or a black guy for for president  not really though  but how effed up is it at this point  uh the nominee's gonna either be a woman or a black guy  uh on the democratic side  yeah that's true  that's pretty messed up  so we're pretty much guaranteed a mccain  uh presidency  well that's got some some problems too man  well of course  like i said yesterday  he looks like a guy that they can't even keep the dandruff off his suits  i absolutely agree with you but um  i i think with the democrats uh 
[00:24:00]  america just uh not there  not ready yet  and what about uh john mccain taking giuliani as the vice president  yeah that they seem to be having a little love fest right there  and giuliani's officially out now too right  getting it interesting  and that could happen  i could see giuliani being vice president  how conservative is mccain  he's not like bush conservative right  no he's kind of all  not all over the place 
[00:24:30]  but he's uh  certain things are  you would think he would be more conservative on  and uh he's not  but you know  you're republican  hmm  all right  and then you got obama  uh the new york post  is endorsing obama  oh they are  yeah they were gonna endorse uh britney spears  but at the last minute  they decided to endorse obama  that's how important that endorsement is  is britney on the uh  ballot  well you know  are you able to vote for her  is it a write-in  i mean the post 
[00:25:00]  this  i don't think  i don't think obama is uh  waking up this morning going  oh my god  you're not gonna believe it  the new york post has endorsed me  i think he wants an endorsement  from maybe the new york times  yeah  the boston globe  the real papers  the real papers  you get  the respected papers  the new york post  so basically a comic book  has endorsed  a comic book  obama  it pretty much is  it has nice pictures  in this thing  the weekly world news  yeah  endorses obama  and still looking for bat boy 
[00:25:30]  yeah  they're barely above that  how do the papers endorse people  aren't they supposed to be  kind of like uh  you would think  attached to a political body  yeah  if there's an endorsement  wouldn't they be a little biased  to their pick  it really is ridiculous  that there's that endorsement  from the paper like that  right  i don't know  you know how bad the post is  uh jimmy and i kind of live in a uh  kind of  ugh  neighborhood  we're gentlemen  it's a  it's a nice neighborhood 
[00:26:00]  but the problem is  the people are awful  they're just god awful  that's what you get  from living there  they're all stuck up  you know what  and i  like there are times  i'll uh buy  like the new york post  from like the  the corner bodega  or one of these newsstands  and there'll be some of these people around  buying their times  and you  you get like embarrassed  that you're picking up the new york post  like you're picking up honcho  true  use the post to wrap up the honcho  i would  i think it'd be easier to buy  you know 
[00:26:30]  smut in front of some of these people  instead of picking up the post  as they're waiting online  with their new york times  just pick up like  one of those  um  all black  uh  gay porno magazines  and then uh  show it to one of those  old  upper west side  snobs  and go  what do you think  should i get this one  go  you like this  nice right  start thumbing through it  and show the pictures  what do you think  nice  nice huh  you'd do that wouldn't you  should i get this one 
[00:27:00]  oh i read this one already  when's the new one coming out  let's say hi to elizabeth  elizabeth  hi  hi how are you  i'm good how are you  good  what do you got uh  this morning  oh i usually don't get up this way  but i was up and i uh  heard your um  that it was uh  have sex with your cousin first  yes  yes  we like having uh  themes sometimes from  for days of the week  because that's what  hacky radio shows do  yeah i think it's a good theme  because i actually uh 
[00:27:30]  i had that  experience a few years back  with uh  one of my cousins  oh you did  how many years uh back  how old a gal were you  it wasn't that long ago  it was  i was about 23  i think  mm-hmm  wait you had sex with your cousin  and then you were 23  yeah  yeah  there shouldn't be any more confusion  in your head  how old was your cousin  he was about uh  20  i guess  all right  oh it's hot  and our first cousin  um  i think it was my second 
[00:28:00]  i hope that's not  jeez i thought i had  a little vindication here  uh  how did that get kicked off  well  we just  we kept running into each other  when we were out  at night  and then  he invited me to his  new year's eve party  one night  and then  he was looking  you know  we were in the presidential suite  so  one thing led to another  and  and cousins are doing it  wait was it the only time  you had sex with him  was that one time  uh  well actually we did it  one more time after that 
[00:28:30]  nice  yeah  did  did  this is kind of pertinent  to the whole thing  did you use  uh  protection that the  uh  guy puts on  yes  oh really  we didn't want to make  cousin babies  and how  how are you related  do you think you're second cousin  so how does that work  like  yeah  what was that  basically our grandmothers  are sisters  your grandmothers are sisters  your grandmothers are sisters 
[00:29:00]  alright so now  i'm  alright now i'm thinking of my grandma's sister  and  and  and her offspring  oh my god that's still creepy  sister's offspring  totally  does he  he's really hot  so  does he look like you  okay i wanted to have sex  with a second cousin too  oh you did  of course  yeah yeah  i just that popped in my head now too  i think about that  yeah  i think that's like okay  i'm from  i'm from a rural  part of the country  i'm not gonna say where  i just in case  anybody  obviously 
[00:29:30]  yeah don't pick up a  don't pick out a state  we'll know who elizabeth is  from like arkansas  oh everyone knows you  in this particular state  in a state  you can't even mention a state  are you insane  do you know how many people  live in every state  in this country  a lot  you can mention a state  well you know  just don't want to have a lindsey love  no i don't  it's a 50 to 1 shot  right it really is  i cut the country in half  it's 25 to 1  have a good morning  i gotta go 
[00:30:00]  she's not gonna fess  okay  all right there you go  sexy little story  our first confession  there you go  someone had sex  with their second cousin  i want to go on record  and say it's completely creepy  thank you  uh yeah  i'm separating myself  a little bit from this bit  because i i can't imagine  on any level  the 20 year old  and then 22 year old thing  is is that's creepy  but when you're 15  16 years old  and uh  you know the  your hormones are going  you're just looking at a girl 
[00:30:30]  that's attractive  and uh  you're thinking  you know  and i never had  sex with my cousin  all right  you should make sure  people know that  i didn't  i  i  but but it was one of those things  where i looked at her  with lust in my eyes  you're not gonna turn me  on this one  you might turn me  uh on your views  of obama  maybe  i wouldn't have sex  with obama either  but this cousin thing man  i just think of my cousins  and every one of my cousins  looks you know  i see myself in them 
[00:31:00]  a little bit  because we're all related  it's creepy  i didn't see uh  myself in uh  well  okay  well  let me re  let me rephrase that  hence  i didn't see  hence the jimmy giggle  a couple seconds ago  i didn't see any  similar look  right  in my cousin  that uh  i wanted to  have sex with  uh  as i did with anyone  in my immediate family  as far as you know  brothers sisters  me  things like that  it just wasn't  um  and just a 
[00:31:30]  a great uh  great ass  uh  nice uh  nice upper half  it just was uh  one of those things  when there'd be a  family function thing  that everyone's hanging  out in i would just  look at her  and think gee  you know  right  and sometimes she  would wear stuff  that was just  you know  really accentuate  that that ass  nice  nice right  nice for his cousin  uh  get sam in here  for a second  damn 
[00:32:00]  let's say hi  to jeff uh  the trucker  jeff what's up  hey guys what's up  hey man  hey jimmy love ya  thank you  um  listen uh  i'm from oklahoma  so you know  this is gonna be  a good one  i live in oklahoma  city myself  but like  cousins from like  south oklahoma  so they're pretty  much hicks down  there  and uh  my dad's  sister's  daughter's  daughter  wait wait let me  figure that out 
[00:32:30]  dad's  sister's  daughter's  daughter  right  so you're  talking about  like  a generation  younger than  you  no because  like  my dad  was like  really young  and all that  stuff  oh so the  ages kind of  matched up  between you  and this  this uh  cousin  yeah  yeah i was  about  i'd say  probably about  three years  older  and i saw her  about two years  ago  she's working  at a walmart  and she's kind of 
[00:33:00]  got this hooker  look to her  so i can't  hang around her  too much  because i just  i don't  i fall for that  real easy  you know  it's rough right  i love them dude  you know  so i was like  you know  she saw me  and they're like  oh she knew  forever  like well yeah  you know  she's like  well we ought to  hang out  you know  i'm like  yeah i don't  think so  because you  know  if i don't  have to pay  for it  i go for it  even harder  so you know  she had that  you know  what i'm talking  about  that look  kind of that  crack or  but you know 
[00:33:30]  a little healthier  yeah absolutely  see any little legs  maybe yeah  so  so yeah  so you're uh  trying not to  have sex with her  right  because if  because if i did  hang out with her  believe me  it happened  i i would go  that far  so  right  because i'm a sick  i'm a sick  bastard  so  how much  how much  dude how much  would it turn  you on  if she if she  said look i'll do it  but i'm gonna need  a few dollars  how much would  that turn you on  oh my god  it'd be bad  i'd be whipping  20s out  in a minute  you know 
[00:34:00]  i yeah  i'm just like  you jimmy man  i i got a problem  i gotta watch it  because if i if i  cruise around  you know for any  length of time  dude i'll  i'll find one  anywhere  so  is it  is it  is it a turn on  to pay for it  oh my god  yeah  i love it  i love it  why though  something about  picking up some  you know  some slutty thing  and then painter  and uh 
[00:34:30]  anyway  oh yeah  i don't know  i don't know  what the turn on  is in paying for it  actually like  what is the turn on  like specifically  with handing over  the care  i think it's the  lack of accountability  you have when you  pay for it  you're not accountable  to them emotionally  or in any way  shape or form  yeah well  the thing is  you know  when you get done  they get out of  your car  you drive away  and you're just  kind of like  oh well  you know  i did nothing  i'll just go home  now but you know  in the back of your  mind it's like  hell that was  that was awesome  i don't have to  put up with crap  either  do you find you're  more relaxed 
[00:35:00]  sexually with a  hooker  like i always find  that i have good  sex with them  because i don't  care about my  performance so i'm  relaxed  totally  see i'm a big  bastard so  yes  you know  it doesn't matter  you know  what you know  what i look like  because i'm  paying for it  so it's like  here i'm paying  for it  just do it  i don't care  what you know  you think  you don't have  the body  self-consciousness  when you're  when you're  paying for it  right  exactly  yep  yeah  so  and  that's where  i am  i love it 
[00:35:30]  so  all right  not everybody  knows that  but you know  where do you  uh where do you  bury them when  you're done  um  well usually  just throw them  in the ditch  when i drive  yeah truckers  aren't usually  burying uh  murderous truckers  serial killers  they're not  burying uh  their their  hookers and uh  whatnot  hitchhikers  yeah  they uh  usually just  dump them  in a little  like those  little gully  things on the  side of the  road  trenches  that's all  those  you just find 
[00:36:00]  a uh  abandoned exit  you know  where there's  no lights  or anything  right right  right  and just push  them out  into the ditch  you know  if i was a  serial killer  i'd be one of  those that  pose them  in disgusting  ways for the  police to find  the angry  yeah that  that would be  me  i'd pose them  like a ballerina  you know  what i hate  about the  serial killers  you know  what i hate  about them  creeps  i hate  the laziness  yeah  every time  you every  time they  solve one  of these  crimes it's  a shallow  grave just 
[00:36:30]  off the  highway  i know  how about  you give  it a little  effort  a little  backbone  into it  how about  you walk  into the  the woods  for a good  hour or so  and how about  you dig a  deeper hole  some elbow  grease  enough  with the  laziness  is that  where you  were going  those two  words were  in my  mouth  every time  they find  the body  though it's  a shallow  grave and  it's like  just off a  jogging path  just off the  highway  just off this  like how about  a little effort  how about a  little exercise  and then  that's what i  saw  the best one i 
[00:37:00]  saw was  they left one  in a box  and they  set it on  fire  right off the  road  yeah  you know  and then there's  those serial killers  that have done so  many that like  when they try to  like a lot of  times they want to  fight the death  penalty so they'll  confess to all  their killings  and help wrap up  a lot of  unsolved crimes  and the cops  will take these  guys to the  woods and they  can't remember  where they  buried them  all yeah  there are guys  that literally  think they  know and  they're like  oh no i  thought she  was here  so many  so many people  they're not quite  sure where they  are i don't know  where that one

[00:42:00]  so yeah like he  showed up and he was  on vicodin and and  his lower jaw was  numb like you could  you could tell it  wasn't like bad or  anything but i could  tell like when he was  talking to me and  then uh they were  passing around the  hors d'oeuvres all  night and some of  them were like you  know just food that  you wouldn't touch  anyway squid and  stuff like that  eroc on on coffee  like doesn't do  anything how are you  on vicodin do you  how can we tell the  difference but then  uh then they started  passing around the 
[00:42:30]  little mini cheeseburgers  oh wow those little  sliders yeah oh and  throughout the rest of  the night uh multiple  times eroc voiced his  disappointment because  he can't eat until five  this afternoon  food all right you have  such an obsession with  food eroc you are  going to be as big as  a mountain i think  the next few years  no my health doesn't  allow it  they can have any  sliders no he has to  wait 24 hours from the 
[00:43:00]  surgery and he just was  bitching about it he's  like they have sliders  oh look at travis is  eating one right in  front of him  c-rock just tipped over  so you haven't eaten in  about 20 hours at this  point i haven't eaten  since uh 12 o'clock  yesterday yeah wow  why don't you  you could live off  that have a fruit  juice a shake or  something or a  smoothie yeah why  can't you have some  liquid sustenance that  would be kind of  healthy what did you  said you drank what  condensed oh yeah um 
[00:43:30]  what they said i could  have something like  some kind of soft food  like really soft uh  vegetables or something  but on the way out i  just opened up a can  of uh campbell's chicken  noodle and just drank it  out of the can that's  how much that's how  much he needs his  stupid food oh i need  it with the eight weeks  of sodium in one  serving that's great  for you why not just  have some uh why not  have some uh what do  you call it this uh

[00:44:30]  probably 99 99 percent of  the listeners have never  seen us that's kind of  weird if you think about  it because we do so much  out there and i bet you  a lot of them think eric is  just a massive mess no  he's uh he's like skinny  fat yeah he's skinny fat  he's not supposed to be  fat like some guys and  girls they're supposed to  be fat eric's not supposed  to be fat he's skinny fat  he's trying yeah he's  trying to he's pushing his  body to the limit take it  to the limit uh wow so

[00:45:30]  for eric oh they've they  yeah the the dose that they  put on the bottle is so under  what it would take to to  actually do major damage  and you know i don't want  to encourage people out  there but that you know  that's what they pretty  much were saying so they're  saying it would be really  hard to od on on ambien the  uh the xanax the valium  because there's a there's a  safeguard in place buffer  zone there's a buffer zone  so yeah lots of buffers so  you got a buffer zone i  guarantee you could eat right  now and nothing's gonna

[00:48:30]  that's because uh the wonderful city  of detroit is in there what about  one yeah miserable city detroit  detroit michigan yeah yeah i thought  for some reason the state of michigan  what about new orleans that's pretty  miserable yeah what what about that  somebody who's lingering longer uh kevin  from philly writes what about asbury  park that is a miserable that's a  horror show no i think it's probably 
[00:49:00]  officially a city city of asbury park  probably they got the small cities  right yeah that's a depressed a  depressed impoverished uh crap hole  those lists are stupid because you can  think of a lot more cities that should  be on the list yeah and they're not so  i don't know what the criteria is it's  it's it's just a waste of time it's it  kills a minute or two on a radio show  uh that's what they put the list  together for to help us out well we  were asking about stockton which is in 
[00:49:30]  second place it has a lot of gang  violence it's right next to modesto  modesto it's the third biggest train  yard in the u.s it has a high  foreclosure rate uh-huh a lot of a lot  of info on modesto coming in today so  and uh we the instant feedback is  working again we say hi to jeff  listening on the edge in buffalo he  writes hey the reason you only see the  lazy serial killers is because the  serial killers that take the effort are  not caught simple really makes a good 
[00:50:00]  point i hope he's not talking from  experience western new york had a fine  serial killer back in the day what was  his name he actually used to go to cmf  events and stuff really how was his  name i do not know oh my god jimmy  knows them all though ashcroft uh  uh as uh uh bob what uh somebody from  rochester or we'll call oh yeah they  did a whole thing on on him oh i don't  know what the heck is his name he was 
[00:50:30]  killing the hookers all over the place  in western new york i only know joel  rifkin who was doing hookers here but  yeah that is oh my god as soon as we get  the name you'll go oh my god i know him  jimmy by the way for the newbies  really knows uh oh yeah his serial  killers yes i think he has more  knowledge on serial killers than pretty  much anyone out there they're  fascinating people love like i i haven't  gone through all the effort that jimmy  has to memorize names victims names  locations and all that i find it  fascinating that he knows so much about 
[00:51:00]  that he'll just rattle off the names of  them and everything but i think to  everybody there there's this fascination  with the serial killers for some reason  there's so many of them i don't know  too like i'll hear about this one wow i  never heard of that one or wow who's  that one yeah who's your favorite  serial killer of all time by edmund  kemper that's good he has an answer i  uh i really like that canadian couple  oh you know what correction edmund  second paula and paul and carly yeah  yeah they they boy what a fun couple 
[00:51:30]  they were oh man just sex slaves and  uh horrific murders and the sister  thing yeah paul uh they're very famous  up in canada paul and carla had this  abusive awful relationship she just got  out actually yeah and uh they he had a  thing for carla's sister so they had  sex with carla's sister and uh she died  because the drugs they gave her so they  actually killed the wife's sister having  sex it was really creepy yeah really  creepy abusive awful relationship who else 
[00:52:00]  do you like in the serial killer world  um i i like kemper the most because now  i'm remembering the sister she was 15 so  that kind of gives me the creeps oh there  you go oh shortcut okay yeah yeah  show cross oh is that how you say  his name yeah yeah he was yeah yeah he  was a bad boy in western new york man  yeah he was fresh and back in the day  we should probably get brother weaves on  the phone he back in the day he went to  cmf events and i think he befriended  some of the people at the radio station  and uh and then he had this whole secret  life going on i bet we got a couple of 
[00:52:30]  those you think yeah oh god we have the  because the the the it's just a cross  section of people so when you have  enough people there's going to be every  kind of every walk don't you think  somebody that listens to this show is a  horrible person oh yeah that has done  just awful horrible things but we make  them laugh we know because one of them  got caught on that goddamn chris hansen  special right and then we know another  one that had a problem with some pictures 
[00:53:00]  on a computer he's serving some time is  there oh some something i i don't know  i think shark Ross was he didn't even a  little cannibal in him too i think i don't  know let's uh find out about him iraq give me  some info on this guy he's a naughty boy he  certainly was uh now we could uh as we're  waiting for that info the phones are lit i  don't know what they're talking about  because uh i think it's people love having  sex with their cousins still a little bit  all right hold on we do have one of  those tim in pennsylvania what's up tim  hey boys uh yeah when i was uh i think

[01:01:00]  perspective they're gonna win the super  bowl and then they're gonna be playing for  other teams next year i mean that's the  reality of this whole thing yeah the fans  take it way more serious than the actual  players you know hold yourself right  donating kidneys to kids with cancer  they just make millions to tackle each  other like i did for free when i was a  boy right i gotta hear that line again i  mean you know come on  you'll always belong with the strong and  the brave  singing your name 
[01:01:30]  what what uh you're more than a champion  you can really understand the words uh a legend is born 
[01:02:00]  sounds like like a melrose place montage song  you know what i'm saying like that just that just drivel  from the days when they laughed at what we did from the struggle when we were only kids now the tables have turned and you're a star  that's who you are 
[01:02:30]  you always belong with the strong and the brave  singing your name  dynasty  dynasty  dynasty  this sounds like one of the 
[01:03:00]  This sounds like one of those bands that had an original song  and then changed it around for the team and hope some radio show would play it.  Yeah, changed the name of their band. 
[01:03:30]  Sounds like they're auditioning for a cable TV commercial.  Yeah, there you go.  That's for the New Yorkers, I guess. 
[01:04:00]  This is a sign of me.  Yeah.  When it's over, you'll try to start again.  One more season to prove that you can win.  I know we can. 
[01:04:30]  Don't ask me.  We'll remember for eternity.  Eternity.  All right.  Let's really look at how long eternity is.  Yeah.  Do you think, let's even give it, not even eternity, 10 billion years.  Do you think anyone will remember?  10 billion years is probably a year in human life, by the way. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, as far as eternity goes, it's really nothing.  It's really nothing.  When the sun goes out and we all just freeze.  When we're all just molecules bouncing around the universe, are we really going to care that  the Patriots won the Super Bowl in the year 2008?  Nobody will be singing about this in 20 years.  Thank you.  They won't be singing this song by next Sunday.  Thank you.  What did you come from, the old Ovi and Anthony show?  Mr. Literal? 
[01:05:30]  What's one of my characters?  I think I got to the point.  Literal Jimmy.  Yeah.  I didn't realize that was literal.  That was literal Jimmy.  What a boob.  I don't think, a billion years, you know, 10 billion years.  Yeah, but I don't even think in 20 years.  Thanks, Jim.  I love Jimmy. 
[01:06:00]  All right, you know what?  Enough of the Dinah Stay.  Yeah, she's not a good writer.  It's awful.  You got a good voice for, like, jingles.  That's one of those little...  Don't sing a jingle somewhere.  Pop song thingies.  The tune's a little catchy, but Dinah Stay.  Is it?  I liked it better when it was called Eternal Flame.  Lydia, Oceanside, what's up?  Good morning, guys.  I have to tell you, all these awful Super Bowl songs are making my depressed patients suicidal. 
[01:06:30]  Why is that, Lydia?  They're so awful that all my patients who are already depressed are getting worse and want to kill themselves.  I'm starting to think that your patients are depressed because they have to listen to your voice.  You got the worst voice ever.  What are you, a nurse?  No, she calls all the time.  She's the psychologist.  All right, okay.  I was going to say, just take a pillow and...  Solve that problem.  Hey, Lydia, have you had any patients off themselves? 
[01:07:00]  Do I have patients off the show?  No, no, no.  Have you had a patient that you were caring for kill themselves?  Unfortunately, yes, I did.  How did you feel?  Did you feel guilty at all?  Or were you like...  Wait, could she tell the story, Jimmy?  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I'll let you hear the story.  Yeah, what happened?  I didn't feel guilty, but I felt really, really super sad.  Yeah, tell us what happened, Lydia.  I can't tell you exactly what happened because I don't want to...  Well, give us some...  Well, at least give us a little... 
[01:07:30]  I had a patient who was a college student and was really, really depressed.  Yeah.  And he kept saying things like he was going to wrap himself around a tree.  He also wore women's underwear.  All right.  He hospitalized him a couple of times.  One night, they let him out of the hospital, and he killed himself. 
[01:08:00]  Even I'm uncomfortable.  Wow.  Wait.  So he was a cross-dresser?  A little bit?  I think it was just underwear.  He said that it made him feel safe.  My name is William, and I like fingernail polish.  I'm going to get rid of all my male clothes and get all my girl clothes.  I would be happy looking like a woman. 
[01:08:30]  My name is William, and I like to wear dresses.  Dresses.  I like to wear dresses.  I love that clip.  Dresseth.  His big fat tongue has to stick out as he says dresses.  Dresseth.  What?  Sounded sort of like that.  Yeah.  Did he?  How'd he kill himself?  That's a bad guy.  How'd he kill himself?  Pills.  Oh, wow.  And pawns. 
[01:09:00]  Do you get attached to patients?  Yeah, I do.  Hmm.  Do you have sex with him?  No.  No?  Not in a long time, at least, Anthony.  Or Opie.  Or whatever.  Whoever's asking.  Way to be observant as a psychologist, you dope.  I'm sorry.  You're very attentive, aren't you?  That's all right.  You're terrific.  I hope you're not using your real name, or your business is going to go way down.  Maybe that's why my patient killed himself. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, good gravy.  All right, Lydia.  I look forward to your calls.  Thanks for calling, I guess.  Great anticipation.  Bye, Lydia.  All right.  Let's go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam, what's up?  Hey, can you guys please play the Super Bowl song?  I want to sing that all day.  I freaking love it.  That one sucks, too.  They all suck.  Wait, which one was that?  No, 18 and no.  One more to go.  Come on.  That song rules.  He knows the words.  Are you a Giants fan?  I'm a huge Giants fan.  So, I don't see, you know, I am rooting for the Pats, but I don't really see a lot of Giants Super Bowl songs coming in. 
[01:10:00]  Ah, well, I think we had our heyday back with the Pasadena song.  Just for you, a little taste there, Adam.  Take 12, man.  Watch it out.  All right.  Yeah.  See the ring.  See the rings?  See the rings?  We got an undefeated team, the best one ever, whatever. 
[01:10:30]  Them Pats making history up in her.  Oh, 18 and no.  18 and no.  One more to go, Super Bowl.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  These days get as hell, they don't stand a chance.  Up in her.  Chargers know you're gonna get a smash.  18 and no.  18 and no.  One more to go, Super Bowl.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Let's say hi to Jared in Boston.  Jared, what's up? 
[01:11:00]  Hey, guys.  That song sounds like the attempted follow-up to a one-hit wonder without the initial hit.  Oh, the Dynasty song?  That's actually a good observation.  It sounds like it's almost a song.  A follow-up to a one-hit wonder without the one hit.  Right.  Lydia sounds like Marion without the extra karma zone.  Boo-hoo.  All right.  All right.  Yeah.  Lydia.  Thanks.  All right.  We're gonna take a break, regroup here a little bit, and get into some of the things.  I think Kevin Smith was supposed to call to talk about Jimmy's acting and stuff. 
[01:11:30]  I didn't hear about that.  Yeah.  He wanted to call.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Kevin Smith called.  He goes, I have to get on the air and talk about Jimmy's acting.  Oh.  And what happened to him, Travis?  He's calling.  He's calling back?  Yeah.  He's shooting a scene.  All right.  He's shooting a scene, and then he's gonna call us back in the middle of shooting scenes.  That's pretty cool.  That's a true friend of the radio show.  But, yeah, Jimmy had to miss a day and a half of work, day of work, whatever.  Went down to Pittsburgh to film a couple scenes for the new Kevin Smith movie, right?  It just seems like a fun vibe, man. 
[01:12:00]  They're all like Kevin.  They all call you sir.  It's just a nice, non-pretentious vibe, and he's just bumbling around in his shorts, hanging  with the crew.  So he's bumbling.  But you know what I mean?  There's nothing arrogant about it.  It was just a really fun...  Maybe he's calling back to tell you that he's expanding your role.  No, I don't think so.  He probably just wants to say that I had a couple of funny lines, and the acting needs  a little work.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, boy.  I'm nervous.  No.  A lot of people are saying you're aware that that Super Bowl song is based on a real song. 
[01:12:30]  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, we are.  Thank you, Scott, and everybody else that's coming up with that.  All right.  Really fast, I gotta remind people, we're sending Sam and Big A to the NBC Knight Rider  premiere party at the Playboy Mansion, and we want you, one of you, to join them.  This is what you gotta do.  You go to onaradio.com and enter to win this chance at a trip to the Playboy Mansion.  And don't forget to watch the Knight Rider movie event Sunday, February 17th on NBC.  More with Opie and Anthony in just a bit. 
[01:13:00]  Waiting for Kevin Smith to call the show.  Opie and Anthony.  Jimmy was on set with Kevin Smith.  Yes.  Very cool.  He's very nice, man.  And he wants to talk about Jim Norton this morning.  I could only imagine what he's gonna say.  I hope it's, you know, you're always a little nervous, though, because I was reading it one  way, and he's like, well, now do it, like, timid.  Like, you want me to try it, like, a different way? 
[01:13:30]  So I'm like, oh, no.  Oh, no.  You thought you had it down the first time?  Well, Kevin, with this scene, you were kind of weird because he didn't want me to see  the dialogue or anyone to see it until we actually, literally, the lady, it was written  out, um, and she handed it to you as you were about, as they were saying, they were  saying, uh, rolling, and you still didn't have your lines.  Wow.  That was Kevin was doing that on purpose, to make it, like, organic.  That's, uh, rough.  But you were reading it.  You weren't memorizing it.  You were reading it off paper.  You were supposed to be reading it off paper. 
[01:14:00]  And I'm in a scene, obviously, with, uh, what's his name, uh, Efron?  Oh, no, Seth Rogen.  You're in a scene with Seth Rogen?  Yes, uh, but he wasn't there.  I was talking.  No kidding.  So it's going to be one of those?  So when the movie comes out, it's going to look like you guys were there at the same  time?  You're probably going to think Seth and I lunched together.  But you didn't even see him?  I was just in the trailer.  We talked.  But I mean, uh.  That's hilarious.  I had to look left at this thing.  It was, uh, straight ahead to camera.  There's a little X by the camera where you're supposed to be looking.  And then to the left of that, they put up a stand with a pink X. 
[01:14:30]  It said, like, uh.  Seth Rogen.  Zach and Mary.  Right, right.  With the two people, and that's who you're talking to when you look left.  At the X.  But why would they have a human being there so you feel like you're talking to somebody?  Probably.  It's tough to feel like you're talking to somebody when you're looking at a stick.  Honestly, because of the, uh.  They probably want the eyeline to be consistent.  Um, and that's all for your eyeline.  And, uh.  The X won't move like a person will.  And a person may give you a weird reaction.  With, with, they assume that you're going to be able to, professional enough just to do it. 
[01:15:00]  They assume you're going to be an actor and be able to pull it off.  I couldn't have, what was I going to say?  Could you go get Seth Rogen and the girl and have them just sit there?  You should have, like, threw a tantrum.  I can't do this unless Seth Rogen is on set.  Yes.  It's in my contract.  I don't work without Seth present.  Right.  I want eye-to-eye contact with the great Seth Rogen.  Well, Kevin's going to call in a few minutes, hopefully, and tell us what the experience was all about.  Uh, Bob Kelly, he was in yesterday.  Good friend of ours, obviously.  He's playing the Comedy Connection all weekend long, all over New England.  I think he played, uh, uh, Rhode Island last night. 
[01:15:30]  Uh, Cow, Cowhoons?  How do they say that?  Cowhoons?  Cow.  And then.  Cowloons.  Cow.  K-O-W-L-O-O-N-S.  Cowloons.  Cowloons.  That's where he is tonight.  And then the Connection in, uh, Faneuil Hall Friday and Saturday.  Yes.  Highly recommend.  Very funny.  If you're not doing anything, then check out Bob Kelly.  But anyway, he was talking about his man crush on Tom Brady yesterday.  And he was really getting into it.  Yeah, absolutely.  Like, not like a joke.  The guy is in love with Tom Brady. 
[01:16:00]  In love with him.  Yeah, there's something real going on there.  Hmm.  You know, some of us will say things just to get a little reaction and get people talking.  Get a little rise out of you.  But he, uh, there's, there's some reality, reality to what he was saying yesterday.  So Derek took it, uh, took the audio and put this together for everybody today.  Baby, it's a dream come true.  Do you have a crush on a man?  Uh, yes.  Who do you got a crush on?  I have a huge, uh, man crush on, uh, Tom Brady. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, I'm not, I wouldn't, I wouldn't have sex with Tom Brady, but I would date him.  Really?  Yeah, I'd like going on a date.  Why do you have a crush on Tom Brady?  He's, uh, he's hot.  Brady has a perfect little bum chin.  His eyebrows are nice and neat.  His hair is...  He's really looked into this.  This isn't even a bit.  His torso is, like, even with his legs.  His, uh, his hands aren't mushed up.  They're nice, nice hands. 
[01:17:00]  Wow.  You ever see him walk out, like, watch him after.  Watch any quarterback on the, uh, post-game interviews.  They're sweating still, and they just look grimy.  They got some t-shirt on.  Brady comes out looking like a supermodel.  And he changes it every week.  One week he's kind of rough with a little scally cap on.  The next week he'll come out with a suit with a, with the, uh, napkin coming out of the pocket.  Then they'll switch it up and just wear a black raincoat to look, like, in New York sleek.  He's not even hot.  He's perfect.  Tom Brady is perfect.  I met him, and my knees got weak. 
[01:17:30]  They took us into the locker room, and it was...  Oh, did you see stuff there?  Just naked football players.  You were, you were in heaven.  I was, he walked out.  He was in a, uh, a double-breasted gray suit, uh, with the white napkin coming out of the pocket.  Pocket.  Oh, picture right there.  Oh, God.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I was just staring at him.  I couldn't stop staring.  You know this is not normal, right?  Oh, it's not normal.  At all. 
[01:18:00]  He's, he, he, he's not kidding.  He wants to have sex with Tom Brady.  What do you think Bob would do with Tom Brady?  I think Bob, like you said, would kiss him.  Um, I think Bob wants Tom Brady to hold him.  Like, I don't even think it's a sexual thing.  Like, I think Bob wants to sit on the couch with Tom Brady and just curl up with his awful  nude body, just like his head on Tom's chest and breathe in his cologne.  And maybe feel Tom's chest here tickling the side of his chubby face.  When does it become gay? 
[01:18:30]  The minute he opened his mouth.  That audio.  When does it become gay, though?  When emotion is involved?  Yeah, I think so.  When you start to get jealous, if you just service your favorite quarterback, it's not  gay.  Not to thank you.  But when you're hoping to...  Thanks for the season.  Thanks for the great season.  19 and a hole.  That's what I say to me.  It becomes gay when there's some emotion involved. 
[01:19:00]  Can I say the most...  When there's a jealousy that starts hitting.  Yeah, when you start to feel something like you would for a girl.  Like, oh God, are you okay?  You could do horrific things, but it's not gay, because there's no emotion involved.  Can I point out the most upsetting part of that whole audio?  It's not even the sexual aspect.  It's that that fat dumbbell thinks a handkerchief is a napkin.  Oh, I know.  He has the napkin in his pocket.  It's probably a $1,000 silk hanky. 
[01:19:30]  You know, the napkin.  What a rube.  Bob's a rube.  All right.  It's just a rube.  One of the disturbing stories that is coming out this morning.  Flight to London.  I hate airplane stories in general.  But anyway, flight to London makes emergency landing.  After the co-pilot has a nervous breakdown.  Can you imagine that?  That's why, you know, when I fly, I'm like, God, there's one, two guys that we're counting 
[01:20:00]  on.  I don't like those odds.  And then one of the guys gets up and goes to the bathroom.  I'm like, holy crap.  Will you just stay in the cockpit the entire time, please?  In case the other one has a heart attack or something happens.  Don't go to the bathroom.  What if you get locked in the bathroom and then that guy has a heart attack?  Next thing you know, we're crashing.  The hell is this?  What's pilots eating cream puffs up front?  Make them where it depends or something. 
[01:20:30]  Don't leave the cockpit ever.  When you see the co-pilot just kind of waiting for his turn at the bathroom, I go into a fit  of nervousness.  Well, do you know how, it's because the airlines are so cheap, if they wanted to, they could  extend the cockpit and give them their own small little bathroom, but that would cut  into maybe a couple of seats on the plane.  Oh, perish that thought.  And then give us our bathroom right behind that so you never have to see him once that  plane's in the air, unless he wants you to.  The other thing I hate, co-pilot or pilot decides to go to the bathroom and all of a sudden 
[01:21:00]  the stewardess is like blocking the way and protecting the area until the pilot's done taking  a leak.  Are you kidding me?  You know what I saw?  That's the defense?  You know what I saw?  They actually had wires, these cables.  There were four cables.  That they pull across now?  And they pull it across and lock it and then stand like there so the person like it would  rush, if they were rushing the cockpit, they would hit the cables first.  That makes me feel better than some stupid stewardess that knows how to give you more coffee. 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Oh, you could just...  I don't need her trying to protect the plane because the pilot has to go...  Clothesline her.  Oh my God, easy.  Yeah.  They also will take sometimes...  You know the car they push the food on?  I've seen them block the entrance with that.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, I like the idea that they're doing that.  And by the way, they do send...  Like a lot of times, they'll send a flight attendant into the cockpit so there's never  just one guy in the cockpit.  Because the heart attack thing was worrying me too.  But they'll always have...  They'll open the door, the co-pilot comes out, the flight attendant goes in. 
[01:22:00]  So that door can always be opened back out if the pilot has a heart attack.  And she could, what, give them lunch?  Wow, she's doing something else.  Give them a beverage?  They're all sluts, let's be honest.  Yeah.  Just banging in city after city after city.  It's not really a great career.  Come on.  I mean, they make believe it is, but come on.  It's for party girls.  Yep.  Yeah, well.  A lot of them are entering cougar phase.  Yeah, we can't even call them, what, stewardesses anymore? 
[01:22:30]  Stews.  They have to have a fancy name.  Flight attendants.  They're getting hammered in these cities and having sex with each other.  Just massive orgies in these hotels.  Oh, I've been in hotels.  You see them come marching in and they can't wait to get to their room.  They've got the same luggage.  They can't wait to get in there and get naked.  Flight to London.  Okay, so the guy has a nervous breakdown.  An Air Canada flight en route from Toronto to London had to make an emergency landing  after its co-pilot apparently suffered a nervous breakdown.  The Boeing 767. 
[01:23:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've removed all my clothing and I hate my wife.  And, yeah, I've seen a few things out here.  If you look out to your left, you might see the giraffe I just saw.  Have a nice flight.  I'm just going to curl up in the fetal position here under the controls and hope for the best.  Thank you.  Thank you for flying.  What did he say?  He's watching the movie. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, my God.  It's the Boeing 767.  That's a big one.  That's a big plane.  That's a big boy.  That's a biggie.  He was flying at 37,000 feet over the Atlantic Ocean.  Maybe he finally realized what he was doing.  Maybe he gave it a little too much thought.  Ladies and gentlemen, we're leveled off now at our cruising altitude of 37,000.  And, holy jeez, we're just in the air in this machine.  It could plummet at any minute. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, my God.  37,000 feet.  Do you know how high up this is?  Don't look out the window, anybody.  There's a man on the wing.  There's a man on the wing.  I saw it.  There's a man on the wing.  I want my mommy.  Can someone get my mommy?  So they're over the Atlantic Ocean, 37,000 feet in the air.  At least he got somewhere to land.  Oh.  Yeah, exactly.  When the unidentified co-pilot began shouting and invoking God, there is no God. 
[01:24:30]  God, I'm a man like you.  Welcome to Oceanic Airlines.  Plane will be cracking in half any minute now.  Don't worry.  You won't die.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Bye.  Or are you dead?  Or are you?  Where are the others?  What were the others?  What?  What?  Got to catch up on my season three. 
[01:25:00]  A little lost action?  Sure.  And he had to be restrained.  That's good.  Who's restraining him?  Who's restraining the freaking pilot?  Co-pilot, I guess.  Crew members and a passenger who happened to be in the armed forces, thank God, held down  the man, shackling his wrists and ankles and tying him into a seat.  The flight made an emergency landing.  Locke must have done it.  In Shannon, Ireland.  That's the kind of guy that would do that.  And the co-pilot was taken off the plane crying and yelling.  Oh, no.  He was being treated at a psych ward for what was believed to be a nervous breakdown. 
[01:25:30]  Down.  Wow.  Can you imagine that one?  You never think when you're getting on a plane and you see the pilot, like, wow, we're  going to have to land and take him off in cuffs.  That's frightening.  Yeah, absolutely.  I would lose my mind.  I would lose my mind.  You think the other captain had to make an announcement to get the people to help?  This co-pilot's freaking out.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, as your pilot's peaking, um...  Wait, I'll do, uh...  Oh, my God! 
[01:26:00]  Oh, my God!  This is my co-pilot, Jim.  Where's my mom?  As you hear, he's having a nervous breakdown.  If there's somebody out there, I could maybe restrain him.  Yeah, because you've got to think, you know, if he's calling for help, that crap was going  on in the background or something was going on in the background. 
[01:26:30]  And, uh, gentlemen, hold on one minute.  My co-pilot seems to be in a little bit of a tizzy.  One moment, please.  Uh, we should be landing in about, uh, 37 minutes, uh, till wheels on the ground.  Uh, take a flight.  Look at us working together.  How cute. 
[01:27:00]  Aw.  What do you got, Jim?  It's almost like the blimp.  Enough about the blimp!  They had, um, gave us the symptoms of nervous breakdown possibilities.  Yeah, all right.  Oh!  Do you have that?  What is that?  Ooh, ew.  There's some symptoms.  Disinterest in work or family life.  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, we're at 37,000 feet and I really don't care.  Uh, my wife and kids are at home and I wouldn't even care if this plane crashed right into my 
[01:27:30]  own house.  Because I know that slut is banging the neighbor while I'm up here, lying you asses.  Sleep disruption or much longer periods of sleep?  Uh, ladies and gentlemen, if you look out your, uh, left side of the plane, uh, you'll...  Significant changes in appetite, such as eating too little or too much. 
[01:28:00]  Ladies and gentlemen, uh, this is your, uh, co-pilot E-Rock.  Uh, a stewardess will be passing around pizza with the garlic butter saw.  Linger-linger.  Lippy.  I love the garlic butter saw!  Ha ha ha ha!  I think I just heard something that wasn't there.  Paranoid thoughts?  Uh, such as the thought people are trying to harm you.  That's it.  They are!  You're freaking out in the cockpit.  head i'm having this paranoid thought that this uh armed services guy is trying to pin me down 
[01:28:30]  oh wait a minute he is persistent anxiety or panic attack wow hearing voices i'm hearing  something it sounds like people directing me which way to go oh it's the tower sorry no but  i'm smart enough not to listen to them i know there's voices in my head i'm taking off now  regardless right i'm just gonna do my own thing because i'm aware that they're just the voices  in my head uh and then there's uh feelings of grandeur or invincibility uh ladies and gentlemen 
[01:29:00]  um let me be taking this plane into space i'm just gonna pull this nose up and uh we're going  we're going to the moon i want to see how high i can get this i think i can get it pretty uh high  before uh yeah the pressure uh just pounds this thing rips it apart thank you someone is uh writing  imagine that they take out the wrong guy oh no they take out the regular guy and leave the kook 
[01:29:30]  and everyone goes back to their seats and that's something i would think about by the way  maybe i do have a little paranoia in my brain because that's something i would think about i  would i would see the guy like knocked out or whatever and tied to a chair and i go well how  do we really know maybe maybe he's the normal guy was freaking out because the other guy was  freaking out they got confused they got the wrong guy down and now this guy is on his own in there  he's on his own in a 767 like there are there are things that they know to do you could you 
[01:30:00]  absolutely landed alone being trained and everything but there are things that they do as a team  uh when they're landing the plane you know cross checks and things like that that he had to just do  by himself under the pressure and stress of having to have your your co-pilot uh uh tackled and tied up  that's a tough situation to be in man imagine if he had a heart attack because of the strain i mean  yeah then what steward is just uh they can probably talk you in i mean i imagine talk you in oh no i'm 
[01:30:30]  just so happy we haven't flown lately i am just not a fan oh yeah i do enjoy flying i like it it's uh  oh i almost said i hate it i got a quick one coming up to san francisco  yeah that's a fast one yeah it's just you know you're up and down in 12 hours  the beauty is going against the wind in the middle of winter that's always a pleasure always a pleasant  flight oh my god it takes you what 12 hours to fly to san francisco from new york and it takes you  about an hour and 15 to come home that freaking winter wind oh my god what is that about all right 
[01:31:00]  we're gonna take a break um so we learned so far today that uh the new york post is endorsing  obama yeah well another very very very important person is uh supporting obama and we're gonna tell  you next all right and you also got some cnn anchors uh you know fooling around uh you got a white  female anchor you got that oh you heard this yeah yeah this is pretty good about last night you like 
[01:31:30]  it right yeah yeah they were doing it's innocent fun and everything and is somebody trying to make  a big issue of it or is it just going away i'm not sure maybe we can find out more info on this but  uh white female anchor black female anchor and they're doing some sexual no it's a white uh two  white females oh okay and a black guy oh okay i read it wrong there you go yeah and they're doing  sexual innuendos things yeah on cnn with racial uh overtones or undertones depending on the tone 
[01:32:00]  i'm gonna i'm gonna go with overtone overtone yeah okay i'll take the tone in the under  and this was on cnn last night so we'll play this for you next all right roy opie anthony old jimmy  norton you're checking out the opie anthony show joining the program adam ferrar from rescue b  playing what uh governors this weekend out there on long island governors this weekend and uh i got a  movie coming out on valentine's day called definitely maybe right on man oh 
[01:32:30]  good you let's move with uh ryan reynolds uh rachel weiss uh i think and kevin klein is in it as well  it's amazing as soon as you see that movie come out i wasn't happy for him i was like annoyed  yeah you seemed like you were bothered instantly bothered oh wait a minute hit the dump button i gotta  call him a name who do you play in it that's cool i play a character called gareth uh ryan reynolds  goes back and starts to work on the clinton campaign in 92 when i play the stephanopoulos  character and his name is gareth oh look at that it's a big role sure nice look at adam very cool 
[01:33:00]  you're in a movie damn you well kevin smith well we're kevin's supposed to call the show to talk  about uh you know jimmy's acting and stuff i don't know what happened i think he's a little busy  directing a movie he's trying to call in between filming scenes but he did call but we couldn't fit  him in he said i'll call back i don't know we'll we'll figure all that out uh speaking of politics  so you got mccain getting some fine endorsements what he got arnold schwarzenegger and he's got 
[01:33:30]  giuliani of course right those are two biggies oh yes yeah and the new york post gave an endorsement  to obama so that's that's pretty equal but obama got the kennedy endorsement yeah he sure did and he got  another giant endorsement that's just coming in really this is a biggie i gotta tell you this is  a huge endorsement for for obama let me guess this could change the whole election yes jimmy  wait we know we already know oprah went with him can we ask if it's a politician 
[01:34:00]  it is not a politician but well i guess it or no well i think just playing the audio will be terrific  in this case this is just this is just massive this could completely put him over the top yeah change  everything like a patty who will hulk hogan be endorsing for president if i had to step out  and say who i really believe in that catches my ear that makes sense that  really could make a change i would say obama there you go  let me tell you something brother brother what an idiot yeah he's a hulkamaniac 
[01:34:30]  brother he's gonna do a leg drop on this country and change it shut up an obamamaniac yeah i'm an  obamamaniac oh take your vitamins shut it let's see if he has anything else to say here  because it's like you know everybody plays this card the bad guy card you know the dirty politics 
[01:35:00]  they talk about the way people dress act and look and he's the truth is hulk attempting to sound  smart yeah i think he's giving it a whirl he's taking a stab at it doesn't have the brother thing  happening or nothing about the way people dress act and look and he's the choice i mean he's he seems  like the real deal you know so i don't read anything into it except what the guy's all about and i think  he's really the only choice and you're not just kissing oprah's ass here you really like him 
[01:35:30]  no no no it's got nothing to do well there you go he's got the hulking oprah i mean what more do you  want in tracking you at least they're mocking it good but who's uh haystacks calhoun going for  very very that's what i want to know you know no one's interesting about hulk hogan i'm gonna vote  for the brothers what did hulk say did hulk just say what's interesting about him when he's not doing  that whole brother thing yeah he sounds like an old queen when he kind of well mellows out his  jimmy is he accurate i'm voting for obama daddy daddy he's like just off from sounding like that 
[01:36:00]  sounding a little bit like he should be in birdcage or something yeah who's vince voting for uh did he  uh endorse anybody yet because he's like the head yeah we're patiently waiting for vince mcmahon do we  have vince i'm gonna vote here he is yes i'm also like hulk hogan i'm gonna vote for that  that's right i'm voting for that we're gonna have a in the white house let's get ready to lobby 
[01:36:30]  that'll shake things up imagine going to the white house and and you knock on the door and and it's  answered by a big what vince vince are you saying that i'm sure it's vince saying that yeah that's  right that's gonna be a in the white house vince i hear you want the election to be handled  differently you want this to be a like a cage match you want a cage match versus john mccain 
[01:37:00]  in a cage match obama and john mccain in a cage match right in the wwe ring it's gonna be on raw  and we'll see who walks out of the cage the president of the united states of america  you have something to say to george bush george bush  he's like breathing flames at this point 
[01:37:30]  yeah that's what we want to know who hulk hogan is endorsing who we care hey i got my first uh  opi maniac uh checking in puddle of aids he writes uh let me tell you something brother man  brother man uh we met him last night he was laughing and rolling his eyes 
[01:38:00]  who shane mcmahon oh shane mcmahon yeah he's uh he's a fan of ants impression but he couldn't  publicly admit it publicly shane used to do our show all the time until he became like a big star  you know now he's he's too he's too big for us like you know what it was shane was vince's son  right when we uh used to talk to him on the show a lot he was vince's son just starting to get into  the um uh personality side of it he had a lot to prove yeah he had the gig because he was vince's son 
[01:38:30]  yeah you know but he's taken over more of the business end of the the company he proved himself these  days yeah so he can't be with the the likes of us he's got stockholders to answer to hey vince  is on the show sometimes though uh yeah but that's different he's barely on the show vince mcmahon  is always the oh you mean our show or or promotional guy early on sam has something  else on shane mcmahon no i was also i was talking to him because jim you said you did his uh bachelor  party that time and you because you told me that you bombed at it because and i i did very very 
[01:39:00]  mediocre at best yeah i was asking about i was like yeah jim still jim talks about when you did your  bachelor party and shane goes yeah man he was so nervous oh oh you're nervous nelly why were you  nervous he was doing all right you know but then my dad looked at him and he was just done yeah i  vaguely remember that because i was no what year would you get married you know no it was a while  ago it was like 94 maybe i was in the business a few years wow and um bob levy who's a buddy of mine 
[01:39:30]  who's anyone knows bob he's a he's a really funny comic and he drinks just to excess or he used to he  stopped but bobby wasn't the one to get into wrestling he was a psycho he would just smoke  marlboro lights and i think i want to wrestle and uh he's nuts so he got the performance change  bachelor party but he wanted me to open for him so i went up and open i think i know vince was there  obviously you know shane and his best man all those people and uh and pat patterson i think was like an  old school guy there yeah and i got thrown because i do crowd work a little bit back then and i was 
[01:40:00]  asking shane let's just ask if i was asking if he engages a certain type of uh let's just say  self-satisfaction uh-huh and he goes ah move on move on he didn't want to answer it oh and you  went like okay okay was it this guy was he what you crazy voice guy well check out the year he got  mad i think it was i think i was still i happy go lucky he needs a sitcom jimmy you know fringe  worthy hey what are you bringing your tape in we gotta keep that theme going i was gonna do it last

[01:41:00]  brother well we were quite embarrassed yesterday i remember the one in jersey spotlight cafe did you  do that one that tv show no but i'm even more embarrassed that shane got married in 96 so yeah  i was oh oh okay so it was the same year as our uh blimp thing yeah it was the transitional period  no shane's marriage yeah yeah yeah that's when we that's when we all sucked a bad year for the  voice yeah a lot of people heard that audio we played yesterday from a radio show we did 12 years 
[01:41:30]  ago and jimmy's next hopefully maybe not tomorrow that might be tough uh turnaround but probably early  next week monday or tuesday oh yeah all right cool uh let's say hi to matt he's listening on bcn in  boston uh what's up matt hey morning boys hey hey i was wondering who the iron chic was going to  endorse this year iron chic pleasure for me pleasure for me to endorse uh obama uh to be the president of  the united states uh for me uh iron chic terenaren the greatest country in world uh uh but madison 
[01:42:00]  square garden uh greco-roman wrestle uh what a what a nut that curly shoot ass is  speaking of endorsements has anyone endorsed hillary officially i don't know um i'm sure bill  you got this of america yeah you got oprah you got you got hulk you got the new york post you got uh  you got julietti you got ted kennedy you got arnold schwarzenegger white white america uh will all 
[01:42:30]  come out and back obama so they look like wow look how liberal thinking and open-minded this  person is that's that's pretty much what it is i don't believe that half the people that are  backing obama actually would back him as president i wish i knew more about i i kind of want to see  yeah how about more of his policy all you see him do is get up there and i'm not saying this is any  different than any other politician but they get up there and just start talking about uh hey and 
[01:43:00]  we're gonna get health care for everybody yeah we're gonna revamp social security yeah we're gonna  take care of poverty and education whoa what uh forget about uh stopping the war yeah we're gonna  stop the war yeah how you doing this how are you how you doing how are you doing this can we play the  commercial we saw this morning getting ready for this radio show he's he's planning on getting a lot  done oh yeah how many years you're gonna be president two decades busy busy guy yeah exactly you're gonna 
[01:43:30]  need about two decades for the laundry list he gave in this commercial 20 years in office he's gonna  like uh bring everybody home from iraq every single person in america is gonna have health care  for free uh social security is gonna be that problem problem solved right uh housing right there'll be  housing for people um it's gonna be an amazing amazing country by the by the way the answer new york  times endorsed hillary that's pretty much it no big names or celebrities though yet but there's no bias in 
[01:44:00]  the media at all yeah no bias you're just paranoid when you say it i think obama is just concentrating  maybe only at first but do you think maybe he's only concentrating on i'll just throw out a random  number 10 of the population no not at all no i mean maybe maybe he just wants that for 10 of the  population first and then if time permits he could get the other 90 percent wow you're what what read 
[01:44:30]  up on obama the stupid college kids are voting youth the youth of america is saying who's voting  for him i'm saying where his interests lie oh that's all i don't think as much as you i think you can't  you just can't be it's not realistic no it isn't it's just not enough black people in the country to  like only concentrate on black black what i wasn't even thinking that obama that's it i'm leaving  wow i don't think there's i don't think there's big enough you don't think the pressure of an entire 
[01:45:00]  uh portion of the country one that's as vocal as a black america is going to put pressure on a black  president to give them what they feel they are owed by a racist country that enslaved them and for  many years uh kept them under their uh boot heel you don't think a black president is going to feel  the pressure you think we've seen black ceos uh uh buckle under the pressure of uh reverend al sharpton 
[01:45:30]  do you don't think a president with the entire black portion of the country uh getting on on the  president to to help them out finally you know now we're finally going to get what's ours you don't  see the president saying eh wow i really um have to cater to wouldn't there be a major outrage if  that was the case what about the white side every other other nationality out there yeah and oh we all 
[01:46:00]  know we all know how white outrage really pays off and changes things whitey sits there and does  nothing that's what white people do we sit around and get kicked around and and just say okay and do  nothing well the thing is this he's got it's almost like you look at condoleezza rice you look at uh  colin powell or you want to look at any any like don't forget i mean he is a politician it's not like  they're just electing some guy who is like celebrating kwanzaa like you know in front of a bunch of white 
[01:46:30]  people and they go you're the guy we want he's a politician i mean would he maybe take more interest  in in black causes than a white maybe but it's like these guys are all pretty much the same once  you get to that level of politics you're pretty much and he's not he doesn't seem like a radical  liberal to me like uh like uh howard dean did i understand he doesn't seem that radical i'm just  saying that there's going to be a lot of pressure and unlike condoleezza rice it's not like a lot of  uh americans look to the secretary of uh state to to help them out doing anything uh or you know 
[01:47:00]  the secretary of defense to to help them out and do anything but the president of the united states  realistically has a lot of power and symbolically has huge power i think more symbolically than  realistically uh and and that alone i think will uh force him to uh do certain things that cater to  one part of this country i don't think he can i don't think he can because everyone's looking 
[01:47:30]  for it he's going to he's going to bend the other way so he doesn't do that but what can he do that's  so radical yeah i think i can't see what i think the system is in place that not one guy could get  that much done what about a democratic congress you get obama and a democratic congress who you know  bend over backwards how does it to look like they are liberal thinking nice we have to cater to  a certain part of this country you don't see that how does this play out in your head  how does this play out if obama becomes president it's the end of america no no i'm not i'm not saying 
[01:48:00]  what happens we could joke around and stuff but realistically i see a lot of uh programs a lot  of social programs coming back almost like the lindsey era here in in new york where um a lot of money  is going to be thrown into a lot of programs that really they look like they're supposed to help on  paper yet it is just uh uh amounts to what is welfare that's what i see and i see a lot of taxation 
[01:48:30]  on uh middle class and uh upper middle class um and it's just gonna i think it'll it'll force people  into um not working like the lindsey era here in new york even with the climate we have now even  with iraq raging and the border and everything yeah even more so i think people are so so they  want to be looked at as being a free-thinking liberal open-minded but again that's just the 
[01:49:00]  perception they want to look like that so i think he'll have a lot more power than you think he's gonna  that answer is false but what happened i thought oh no i wanted all right all right try again  try again so why anthony is paranoid that's what i like hearing well let's go to christy yes uh christy 
[01:49:30]  what's up hi hi christy what's up you are way too paranoid anthony all right i'm willing to listen  hold on hold on a second that answer is true oh no wait a minute uh all right christy i i would  love to hear your take on why i'm paranoid um i i have to agree with jimmy and opie here that one man 
[01:50:00]  no matter what shade he is has that much power plus anthony we've talked about in the past you  know obama's gonna get the tour of the white house if you know what i mean oh oh where they show you  the certain things well they show you the aliens and all the stuff that they actually know and say  you're not really in charge here we are yeah keep up a nice uh front or else you end up like uh old jfk  yeah let's uh show you the footage of actually what happened that day yeah you know every president 
[01:50:30]  gets the tour i'm not paranoid i just think that he will have a lot more leeway and a lot more power  than uh old white guy presidents have because congress will give him a lot more leeway and a lot more um  they'll they'll they'll let his ideas and his uh whatever uh uh bills he comes up with uh pass 
[01:51:00]  through they don't look racist false oh i but i had that one oh can i try this game  oh look the little mountain climbers going up come on don't stop come on i stink at this game yes  question you have the same fear if hillary is in office because half the country not 10 is female  do you think that we'll pass a lot of bills that support us ladies no because it's different 
[01:51:30]  females uh uh run the gamut of race and um that that's different that answer is  true oh nice  but i don't think obama's i love you guys all right christy anthony's paranoid as hell but have  a great he he has really worked up about this obama he really is worked up but i think he's the  voice of a lot of people out there i'm becoming more liberal as i get older i find a little bit 
[01:52:00]  more the fcc has put such a bad taste in my mouth that they bed wetter the restrictions on  the fcc has put such a taste in my like it's so bad i just kind of want things to be balanced  out a little yeah i got you i agree with you on text yes you see that was appointed by bill  clinton yeah but they kind of you know it all rolls downhill whoever's kind of whatever the  flavor of the week in the white house is that's pretty much you know it doesn't matter who appoints  you they're not supreme court justices hi who's this striker all right what's up evening striker  hey uh anthony i just want to point out that you are so correct most political analysts support 
[01:52:30]  what you're saying thank you even the democratic political a lot of the democratic political  internationalists support what you're saying too that there is a significant fear of an extremely  liberal congress that we have now and somebody as liberal and as obama would be very bad for this  country well well how's it gonna be worse sir we're having and again i i supported bush don't get me  wrong i'm not some again i'm not some bedwetter at all uh and i think political correctness is  horrendous and i think the democratic tax uh stuff is is guilt-ridden and horrendous however i mean 
[01:53:00]  we are kind of in a mess at this point well but you know one of the things if you go back and do  some research on some of the stuff on obama uh not only this p.s that's going on with uh resco  but there is some stuff that limbaugh had and i've looked into and i've heard other people talk about  the way that obama got started in politics makes him a very nasty person he's done nothing for civil  rights for his own people and the woman who in illinois was doing a lot for civil rights there 
[01:53:30]  he defeated her in such an underhanded nasty way a few years ago that he this guy's got some real  issues and i think he gets in office and you're going to see the things go downhill and jim you  know if you think political correctness is bad now wait till he gets in office no i don't even  disagree with i don't even disagree with that however i will say as far as nastiness in getting  into office what do you think you don't think bush kind of lucked up a little bit because of who his  brother and his father i mean come on that's silly oh definitely but i i think obama is going to be 
[01:54:00]  even worse and if he has the chance to get into that spotlight he's going to do even more and this  is going to be a situation that we don't want and but at the same time i also another fear i have is  if he gets in office he may be the next assassination i hate to say that he's got the most security  people oh they'll have security there's no way he's going to be more hated in the world than george  bush is i mean there's people that i despise bush it doesn't matter yeah but you know we also have 
[01:54:30]  a great organization here in the states called the clan and he's oh god i never quite heard it  wow heard them endorsed like that answer is false oh oh so sorry sorry hey the phones are lit but  we gotta take a quick break so we'll continue with this also we gotta get that uh cnn thing that  uh happened overnight all right and woman has jesus statue stolen ransom note says it's because of her  wiener poopy so uh i have no idea what that even means we'll explain after the break but first the

[01:56:30]  guys get on my nerves i change the channel yeah that's what you're supposed to do though yeah yeah  but i'm pretty loyal to you pricks but uh yo man i i love listening to you middle-aged white dudes cry  about this nonsense like one black dude is going to change the world what's the matter anthony you're  not going to have enough ammunition you can't play your little video games what's the deal g what hey  wait wait wait you know i wasn't saying anything about that ruben sounds very angry i i'm with you 
[01:57:00]  ruben i don't think one guy could completely change america i i think there was a time i think there was a  time that one guy could change america but i don't i don't believe in that anymore  no i really don't stop you can't say one word with the backing with the backing of uh everybody  that will back him and and not uh not be so confrontational with him  what monetary power answer me what what monetary power is gonna back him what monetary power no i'm 
[01:57:30]  i'm just i'm talking about like social power and i'm talking about congressional power he'll he'll  be able to do a lot more things uh hopefully good uh but he'll be able he'll be able to do a lot  more things backing him with the backing of congress than old white guy what old white guy  from what it sounds like i don't think nobody that you hang out is going to vote for the dude 
[01:58:00]  any old white guy i'm saying if you get the president in there and he's old white guy there's  always a problem he comes up with stuff and and congress says no and congress comes up with stuff  and he vetoes it and stuff uh this young black guy falls in line though no it doesn't it's not  about black guys it's about white people in congress that don't want to look racist so they  will sign off on a lot more things i think that obama comes up with than they normally would uh just 
[01:58:30]  based on partisan lines that's what i'm saying to a point to a point to a point which is you know  a window dressing gets the ball rolling yeah but it's not gonna roll that far they'll do it the  same way they always do it they'll throw anything they want done into that big uh what they  call the pork barrel a whole bunch of yeah and then you vote yes for one bill you vote yes for  fifty bills you vote no for one you know that's why they'll let earmark stuff so they get what  they want it the same way everybody else does it does have some muslim connections though so is it 
[01:59:00]  a pork barrel can we call it that i think we got it one black dj dj on that show g what's that dj  we do too it's e-rock we got we treat them like that we got a couple black guys associated with  the show big time and this rock station in new york has uh has a black dj you know i can't believe  i got reuben okay thanks thank you reuben we got reuben angry uh kiana she's black i don't think it  was us that got him angry uh yeah he thinks all right it's me uh oh yeah we have sam working for 
[01:59:30]  the show too yeah thank you for reminding me of that uh kiana what's up hey what's going on i was  just calling in to say like as a black college student i really think anthony is not just sounding  paranoid he's kind of sounding naive oh okay that answer is true oh that's true you're not gonna have  like the first black president just be able to run wild and give reparations but out they're gonna 
[02:00:00]  have a lot of tight range and if there are really black people out there that are like oh if we vote  them in we're gonna get our reparations then they're pretty naive too well i have meetings with  him like you can't say this you can't make you know congress look like oh we're racist or whatever  because that's not going to be good for the country they're gonna let him know you know how far  outside of the bounds he can step i i totally think it's true i think he's gonna have a tough  time doing anything because he's a black president i think it's gonna be actually tough what year do 
[02:00:30]  you think this is for the love of god what year do you think this is uh 1982 no what it's 1993  it it's this we are in the new millennium there is a whole new thing going on of um minority power  and this goes along with blacks asians there there is it's this power base 
[02:01:00]  in the 60s too and look how far we go no not the 60s still had uh the fire hoses and german shepherds  out jesus maybe if there's a black president though maybe uh like a lot of a lot of uh say people who  are disenfranchised if that's the right word yes uh would cease to be that way because like i guess  look i play devil's advocate here you're black and all you hear is that america's the land of  opportunity but you know you've been kind of getting dumped on for a long time and then  all of a sudden now there's a black president maybe that kind of changes your perspective a 
[02:01:30]  little bit goes all right well maybe uh america is what it says it is okay that would be nice  i mean maybe it changes the perspective too i think all black people are going to look at it as  it's like yeah you know what we are getting a little bit further if we can vote in a black president  that's a little bit further see that's just it jesus christ i don't want to hear a little bit  further if obama gets in all bets are off we're we're even i want that's what i say we're goddamn  even i don't want to hear any more crap somebody give me 40 acres and a mule yeah i don't think 
[02:02:00]  that we should be looking for anything more is all i'm saying and you're worried about that oh but  there still will be obama in then that's it then it's done like game over it's a tie even steven  black con you've had black uh obviously black congress black senator you've had black secretary  of state uh um you know i mean black president would be it would be like we have that would be  like the top like okay we can make it to the top yeah see there's nothing holding you back a well 
[02:02:30]  educated uh black man can become the president of the united states so stay in school uh  work hard and you too can make it that's pretty much what it's saying the country is no longer  keeping you down uh there you go and i haven't felt like the country was keeping me down but i agree  with that well you sound very nice and educated yeah i got a question for you you're a black college  student in boston which means you're crazy um you think uh the really black people are going to vote 
[02:03:00]  for obama no one has really uh you know you think brought up this issue well i i kind of feel like  no those are people that don't normally vote anyway i'm talking about the black blacks yeah those are  people that are normally so disenfranchised as jim said that they don't vote anyway i think you're  wrong i think people will come out and vote i think people would i think that more people will  come out and vote i agree because of this and i don't think that like all the black people are just  going to be like there's a black president let me vote for him they're still going to be like oh 
[02:03:30]  it's not going to make a difference he's probably not going to get voted in it's not going to be  like a big landslide over the black people as you think and there are a lot of black people that like  hillary there are a lot of black people that like some republicans let me tell you something and i'm  going to predict this he will get at least 75 of the black vote people who don't normally vote will  come out and vote because he's not jesse jackson was a guy who to me was never a real candidate because  he's not a real politician um this is a guy who's a real candidate who can handle himself at least 
[02:04:00]  at least well on tv in a political debate in the political arena i think people will come out and  vote for him uh the hardcore black dudes because the big picture is getting a black guy in office i  think they absolutely will and in south carolina jimmy you're correct uh he got eight out of the ten  yeah black uh eight out of ten blacks and black women which way you think black women are going to  go and and let me let me ask you this do you think since he got so much of the  black vote down south do you think that they were voting on his policies or the fact that he's black 
[02:04:30]  you know what i think that there are a lot of ignorant black people just that like there are  a lot of ignorant white people and they might not know all the issues they might not know all  policies and they might be voting just because he is might i'm not saying that every black person  is going out there like i like what he stands for a lot of people are basing their vote a lot of black  people on the color of his skin on the color of his skin i don't i don't agree with that what i 
[02:05:00]  don't agree how do you not agree with that a lot of the a lot of the white college kids the youth of  america i'm not talking about them i'm talking about black people black people saying that so  much of the black vote is going toward obama obama and and why is that because they're familiar with  every program and they've done all the research and they know where he stands on all these issues  or because he's black because every white person that's not voting for him is not yes okay because 
[02:05:30]  he's black i'll give you that i think that every black person that's voting for him is voting for  him because maybe because i feel like when a few years ago when like you know it's 40 years ago i mean  basically not that long ago when certain blacks wanted to go to certain colleges i mean they had  that the military escorts them in right and now there's a guy running for president i don't mind  it's like i kind of see it it's like the problem is this we're all this racial crap because we're  kind of the pendulum is sunk so far in the way of being politically correct it's not it's not swinging  back and becoming normal again that's the normal we're in but we're not becoming good again not you 
[02:06:00]  know what i mean like you know just like the complete opposite end but i'm just saying i think he looks  like a good politician you don't go down south and play it up like you know i'm just the black man that's  trying to get into the white house just like he knows how to go to iowa and play it up like i'm  just an educated man who's gonna work for white people just as much he's a good politician like  he's playing it up for everyone yeah i mean when you look yeah well who is he which one is he yeah 
[02:06:30]  but every politician does that yeah hillary's a politician absolutely does what obama's i'm not  saying he's some alien that's you know come down and and is doing things completely different he's  playing this out like every politician does believe me you're you're absolutely right he's  a very good politician but uh you know the there are uh other things involved here it just with a  black with a black candidate kiana thank you very good phone call thank you and i'm not so scared i  know i want people to know i'm not this petrified guy that there's gonna be a black guy in the white 
[02:07:00]  house what false no god sorry i thought that was true sorry because i said i wasn't scared of this  whole thing i'm so glad you don't have a dog paranoid or anything start talking to you what  listen we can pick up this subject on any day but yeah but um there's a one more thing we want to  get in before we get out here we can we can talk about this again tomorrow we're here every morning  so you guys call in any time he'll still be black tomorrow the election's 10 years from now or  something i don't know who's calling that doesn't have a name who are you sir hello are you talking 
[02:07:30]  to me yes yeah what do you got hi this is brian from kentucky hey boys uh there's a little story  tidbit there for you there's a guy who is paralyzed as in the paper today and his pit bull ate off four  of his toes while he was sleeping okay now we're getting to the hard-hitting news that we should be  addressing we gotta end with the light side of the news this is the light side of the news what  happened well i'll tell you old jelly toes man in his late 20s from this home to the hospital this 
[02:08:00]  morning after his friend tells us a pit bull puppy chewed four of his toes off dexter five-month-old  dog china went with animal control officers without any problems a friend tells us terry smith owns the  dog and that the puppy chewed all but the big toe off smith's left foot smith's friend tells us smith  is paralyzed from the waist down and was in his bed his friend had stayed the night and woke up to 
[02:08:30]  find smith injured but he still says china is a good dog but i won't say the dog on camera the dog's not  a bad dog um it's just a puppy um you know it's that guy's pride and joy you know it just it  i don't know what happened it just ate it i guess it was just playing and just kept playing  now that puppy will be in quarantine at the animal control center here in lexington for 10 days  and we know that the owner likes the dog a lot and his friend says he'll try to get it back 
[02:09:00]  they're gonna kill this dog man this dog is so done if you're paralyzed below the waist there's a lot  worse things the dog could have eaten yes keep that dog out of the bathroom i guess it only wanted a snack  he must have just you ever see puppies play with chew toys and they do that keep going  that side of the mouth thing he must have just done that had his little puppy paws wrapped around  his foot and he's just gnawing away on his toes as they're just snapping off and you're always that  hysterical yeah you can't blame the dog you can't blame the dog because that's probably exactly what 
[02:09:30]  he was doing he got no reaction from the guy so he's thinking okay yeah i'm not doing anything wrong  here right yummy yummy meaty does no way at his toes treats snoring meaty toe treat and you know  that the toes probably smelled edible on some level because dogs you know they'll eat anything and the  feet if if he's paralyzed he probably doesn't worship his feet it's a little stinky a little  and the dog likes snossage smelling feet snossages the dog has probably been looking at them dangling 
[02:10:00]  stupidly off the air for a while he's been eyeing those for days yeah like two hanging taunting  five-toed treats hey uh paul from buffalo and and he's typing in caps god damn it he's not black he's  muslim what who barack obama is not muslim don't tell anthony that it'll get worse  no that was a rumor that was started that they've been trying to squash for a long time  do your own research google wikipedia do all that barack obama is not a muslim no even if he was born 
[02:10:30]  a muslim i would care less he doesn't really identify himself as a muslim and he certainly  doesn't seem to live you know but there's been some mass emails and and and such uh you know trying  to push that point it's just it's just not true uh i don't have the live machine in front of me oh well  and then finally he's not black he's muslim he could be bold you certainly can muhammad ali was  both of course still is i think he's black first certainly like first right hey what's this uh the 
[02:11:00]  the female anchors anthony i think we could squeeze this in before we get out of here on cnn a couple of  the uh female anchors were uh chit-chatting with each other and there was a black gentleman uh who also  does the news over there he was off camera and they started talking about um going away on a  little vacation and how the three of them maybe can go and then she threw in some uh some kind of  little sexy threesome reference uh that would have involved the two white girls and uh the black guy 
[02:11:30]  this was on cnn yeah yeah and we're pigs predicting the future of the stock market here if i could do  that you know you and i could go off to an island somewhere hey that sounds good to me name the island  sister we're we're there jerry willis say oh don says don't leave him out all right all right  you come too come on yeah thanks he's paying thanks jerry sandwich you're welcome

[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Thank you. 
[02:17:00]  Thank you. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you. 
[02:18:00]  Thank you. 
[02:18:30]  And we still got problems.  We got faithful listeners waiting out in the cold.  So what?  They could get a glimpse of us walking from one station to the other?  Who gives a shit?  They don't get a glimpse of me.  I have my hood pulled down and collar pulled up.  Most people, they see us walk by, they go, oh, that really wasn't a big deal at all.  They're walking.  And then they're standing out in the cold.  These people could be in a warm studio waiting for us up here.  They could have all their paperwork filled out and filling out the paperwork before we even get here. 
[02:19:00]  Right.  You know, I hope Don's listening.  The system still sucks.  Logan's listening.  The system still sucks.  Logan's listening?  We only give you maybe an hour and a half of XM a day.  That's if we feel like, you know, giving them a show.  Would you not say that?  Because then the idiots actually think it's true.  Oh, I love fucking with them because they think they know something.  They don't know anything, really.  Giving them a huge bonus show.  So what would be smart to me, you have everyone ready to go. 
[02:19:30]  So when we come in here, ecstasy of gold is over.  Boom, here we go.  Cherry darts.  Showtime.  You get a little more airtime.  Quality airtime.  Instead of us sitting here just kind of bullshitting as Red Rum fills out the same fucking paperwork  she's filled out ten times already.  It's nice.  Just take out the Red Rum file and be done with it.  Copy it and put a piece of tape over the date and then run it through the copy machine  and then write the new date in.  Take a picture of her vag. 
[02:20:00]  No reason for that.  Just say it's for the file.  It's 9-16 and half the audience is still standing out in the fucking cold.  Yeah.  Our system sucks.  More people that come to the studio and it's fucking winter out.  What's more infuriating.  And they're standing in the cold.  It's 9-16 and we're saying our first words here on XM.  It's more infuriating.  Wait, we're too early?  Yes.  We need a longer break.  It should be at least 9-30.  We need a little break between the shows.  I agree with that.  Maybe we stretch it some days.  Give us a break. 
[02:20:30]  I mean, come on.  We give you Radio Gold every other day.  That's right.  Every minute of every day you get gold.  Lucky devils.  But I just don't understand why these people.  The system sucks.  It's just stupid.  Same paperwork.  What?  Did Red Rum take a government job since the last time we saw her?  I mean, come on.  They move?  Fuck it.  Yeah.  What could possibly be different that the same paperwork has to be filled out?  They were told in their email not to be here before 9 o'clock at the latest. 
[02:21:00]  They were told to be here at 9 o'clock.  They should have been told to be here at 8.30.  8.30.  They're up by 8.40.  They're signed in before 9 and they're only waiting a few minutes sitting here.  I don't comprehend it.  When we walk up, they're all sitting there.  Paperwork's been filled out.  We can get a rousing round of applause from everybody.  Yeah.  This way we can go right into the bit.  Yeah.  Instead of wasting time.  Because then that means we've got to do bonus time.  And, you know, we don't like doing bonus.  Well, if we need to fill, Adam Farrar will be Governor's Friday and Saturday. 
[02:21:30]  Yes.  And the movie definitely maybe opens on Valentine's Day.  Are they done yet?  We've got 20 guys that work for the show and it's just stupid.  Oh, now the 20 guys are gone.  Oh, boy.  Whose fault is it?  No, they all are doing their jobs.  It's the organization of the 20 guys that is stupid.  So I blame Don Wicklund.  Sorry, Don.  Wow.  Why?  I blame Don Wicklund today.  Really?  Because our system sucks.  Yeah, but I'll say this for Wiki. 
[02:22:00]  Why are our listeners just waiting outside every day to catch a glimpse of us?  Who gives a shit?  Get them up here.  Get them warm and ready.  I agree.  I think that's on our end, though.  Because I don't think Wicklund even knows that.  You go to any...  We're sort of like any other TV show that kind of does their thing in New York City.  People wait.  They go in.  They get settled.  And then finally the show begins.  You know what I mean?  Right.  The show doesn't begin before the audience.  We're the only show that does that.  They're still coming in as we start the show. 
[02:22:30]  Can you imagine Letterman?  I know we're not on the same fucking...  You know, we're not on the same...  What's the...  Level.  You know, we're not on the same level as Letterman, but can you imagine Letterman just all of a sudden...  He's starting his monologue as they're still coming in.  And people are filing in.  Wait, you don't think we're on the same level?  He had Barack Obama on.  We're having girls having cherries thrown at their assholes.  We so transcend his level.  I know we do.  And by the way, we can't even do that right because we bought cherries and someone decided to steal our cherries.  Yeah, I'd love to get to the bottom of that motherfucker. 
[02:23:00]  We had, what, how many cherries in a big jar?  And stupid Steve.  Steve is as dumb as they come.  I mean, we focus on E-Rock, but Steve, you are dumb.  And I know you can kill me, but I have to say why.  I'm not dumb.  Steve actually, this morning, goes, someone ate 150 cherries.  Just please do the Steve impression when you do Steve.  I can't do an impression.  It's easy.  Yes.  No, I want Jimmy to do it.  I don't want to do it.  You do it.  No, please.  I have to scroll.  I'll scroll. 
[02:23:30]  You do the cherries thing.  Somebody please do an impression.  Where's the cherries?  Wow.  We bought, I sent Pat Duffy out yesterday to get all the, you know, accoutrement for the fucking contest.  And he put six bottles of maraschino cherries in the fridge this morning.  They were gone.  So sometime in between yesterday afternoon and this morning, all those cherries disappeared.  Find somebody who's going to shit water in the next hour.  Red water looks like the bloody ass. 
[02:24:00]  Did someone decide to clean out the fridge?  Some dummy?  Like, seriously, what happened?  Does anyone know?  I checked with Earl.  He said they were not there when he got there last night, but who knows?  I don't know.  Wait.  Who the fuck touched our stuff?  I have no idea.  They should be fired.  Whoever touched our fucking stuff should be fired.  I have no idea.  I like that, Jimmy.  I like when you get like that.  Enough already.  This is ridiculous.  There's a fucking audience listening and like a bunch of jack-offs were like, well, we'll  get started in a while.  We don't have the cherries.  Peep off the sign shit. 
[02:24:30]  Who's going to sit through this?  They're filling out just loads of paperwork.  I don't get it either.  Why do, first of all, get Don fucking Wicklund on the phone.  I'm going almost as high as me.  Get Don on the phone.  Hey, is that the girl from the other contest?  Yeah.  Is this Wicklund's up?  Yeah.  Yeah, we've seen her naked.  She fell asleep on the couch.  I remember you.  Okay.  All right.  Russell Peters is here.  Terrific.  We'll get to him in a second. 
[02:25:00]  Did he bring cherries?  Well, we're having a massive breakdown here.  I don't understand why this happens.  What is policy?  Why do the fans have to wait outside in the freezing cold?  That's not Wicklund, I don't think.  That's us.  That's us.  Because I think that they like, no one's ever thought through that they're standing in  10 degree weather and that they should be signed in first.  I don't know why.  But we got security here.  So can't Master Poe bring these people up while we're making the transition from the  other station to this station?  I asked Poe that and he said that.  See, this should be like this.  We come in, the radio would get way better because if all of a sudden we're not just 
[02:25:30]  bullshitting and hanging out as the audience gets settled, they're sitting there ready  for a show, you're feeling the energy, mics go on, bam, it will just sound better instantly.  Instantly.  That's a simple thing that needs to be done.  So what happened to our fucking cherries?  We got new ones.  I know we got new cherries, but what happened to the old cherries?  I don't know.  How many portions did you have?  How many portions?  Strawberries.  Strawberries, right?  I have no idea. 
[02:26:00]  I mean, everybody on our staff left with cherries in the fridge.  Yeah, I don't think our staff did.  I mean, that's the limit of our information.  And since Earl is the leader of the people that come after and he says they were not  there when he came in.  Earl is the leader.  Just hearing that upset me.  Somebody knows something about the cherries.  We have video cameras, don't we?  Somebody knows something about the cherries.  So fess up.  Who took our cherries?  Who thought that they were just cleaning the freaking fridge?  They called me old Yellowstain. 
[02:26:30]  They sang songs about me.  They sang songs.  By the way, Yellowstain Blues.  It's now 924 and the audience is almost seated.  Cool.  But they are still filling out paperwork.  Lots of paperwork.  Yeah, they just got in.  I mean, why?  We started XM at 9 or 910.  Right.  Whatever it is.  Would they be ready to go?  Because we have 12-11.  Ah.  And look, Sandy Kane's here.  Why does Sandy Kane have to fill out paperwork?  That freak has been here a million times.  This fucking is so inefficient.  Inefficient.  What a fucking... 
[02:27:00]  I don't...  If you're turning your radio off right now, you're crazy because we're terrific.  No, I would rather listen to the Zep channel on 59 myself.  I don't fucking...  Of course.  Or maybe Kane spin some tunes on Ethel.  You know, this shit is for the birds.  I mean, it's ridiculous.  Listen, I can't plug again.  No plugging.  Nope.  No plugging.  We're going to be plugging girls' assholes in a little while.  With cherries.  Cherry darts.  You know how cherry darts works.  Could someone ask Poe why...  What did he say? 
[02:27:30]  It's up to Steve.  Poe's just doing what he's told.  Poe would bring them up.  Poe doesn't make them stand outside.  So it's Steve's fault.  I don't know.  I mean, but from...  Now here comes Steve.  Steve.  I don't know.  What?  I can't do you.  I asked Poe...  We don't know who this is.  This is somebody...  I don't think it's Wicklin.  Because Wicklin's not here every day.  Poe, I said Poe.  What happened?  Can we...  Poe, can we get these people up earlier?  Is there any issues with Washington?  Not at all.  We can get them up whatever time you want.  We'll get them up here. 
[02:28:00]  They should be seated as we're walking in.  No one gives a shit they see us on the street.  They really don't.  Ass is in the air.  Cherry's at the ready.  Right.  And the paperwork could be done.  I mean, we could get these people coming up here quarter to nine.  They're doing their paperwork.  Because it drives us nuts to see these people fill out the same paperwork every time we're here.  I think everybody was of the mindset when we used to do the walkover.  And people would join us for that.  And then all come up at the same time.  Right.  But since we don't do that, there's no reason for them to stand there and wait and not have all this paperwork done. 
[02:28:30]  They should get nice and comfortable.  So I don't think anybody really gave it any thought.  And I want to start giving them all hot cocoa.  What?  How do we get that done?  I don't know.  A little hot cocoa for everybody.  Who's paying for that?  I don't pay for a fucking hot cocoa.  Yeah?  Yes.  How many days?  A month or so.  Until winter's over.  Some days we have one guy in here.  We can't give him a cup of hot cocoa, make him feel at home.  Guy.  Shouldn't even let one guy in here. 
[02:29:00]  That's usually our audience is one guy.  One effing guy.  Filling out paperwork.  I mean, I wouldn't come either in the winter if I had to stand outside fucking half a building away by a shitty fence just to wait for the stars to walk by and get away.  It's ridiculous.  Stars.  Steve.  Well, thank you.  New policy.  We start getting these guys up earlier.  You guys figure it out, okay?  That would be very nice.  I don't want to see one word from signed.  It's really cold in New York today, and these are faithful fans of the show, and they're fucking shivering outside. 
[02:29:30]  And Steve.  Waiting for us pompous assholes to walk by them.  That policy is to stay in effect until we yell that we don't want these motherfuckers in here before we get here.  I know.  Because that's how everything works.  Then it's different.  Policy, policy, policy.  Screaming fit.  Policy change.  New policy.  I know.  Upsetness policy.  But just for a contest.  I don't know how we didn't have them ready for a contest.  Yeah, that's true.  You know what we're doing today.  Absolutely.  All right.  For now on.  All right.  Let's look to the future.  It's all about looking to the future. 
[02:30:00]  You know, you could have emailed the paperwork.  They could have brought it in signed already.  No, that would be...  No, we've tried that before.  It never works.  It doesn't work.  It never works.  They wipe their ass with it and throw their feces at people.  I printed it out.  And then I ate it.  Well, why can't they do that, though, if they want to?  Why can't that be an option for them?  It has been in the past, and it never works.  All right.  Now, here's the other thing.  We could talk to Don about the paperwork, because that's still ridiculous.  Two, three years later, it's ridiculous.  All right.  Now, what's up with the cherries?  What do we know about the cherries? 
[02:30:30]  We know that we had to go buy new ones, so we have cherries now.  When was the last time we saw the cherries in the...  When I collected them from an intern yesterday at 12 o'clock noon.  And where were the cherries placed?  By me, underneath the desk.  Pat Duffy put them in the fridge.  And from the fridge to this morning, we don't know what happened.  Which fridge?  The one in the common area or the one in the Ron and Fez office?  Let me find out.  I think in the common area.  Either way.  Who was the last person to see the cherries, and what time was it? 
[02:31:00]  Here comes Pat Duffy.  Hello.  For the cherry investigation.  Just answer the question, sir.  What time did you see the cherries in the refrigerator?  I'd say about 11.30 yesterday morning.  11.30 yesterday morning.  Were you the last person to see the cherries?  Yes.  As far as you know.  Yes.  11.30.  So sometime between 11.30 and what time did we realize the cherries were missing?  4.30 this morning.  So between 11.30 and 4.30 this morning, someone here at XM took the cherries. 
[02:31:30]  Yes.  So we have video, right?  That constantly videotapes who walks in and out?  Yeah.  Then let's watch the video.  Let's look at the tape.  And see who touched our shit.  Well, someone just threw it away.  The only other guy in here besides Ron and Fez and us is that guy Buddy.  I don't think he would just throw four things of cherries away.  No.  Somebody decided to clean out the fridge.  Some asshole.  Who would clean out the fridge?  Does the refrigerator look like it might have been cleaned out?  No.  No.  Not at all.  So that's even more suspicious.  So everything else was in there except the cherries.  Yeah.  Month old milk is still in there.  All right. 
[02:32:00]  See, no one cleaned out the fridge.  Someone did it on purpose.  Someone did it on purpose.  Absolutely.  Or drank a shitload of Shirley Temples.  Yes.  What?  What do you think?  Theory?  I don't know if I'm getting confused because I don't want to implicate somebody incorrectly.  Please do it.  Let's go.  This is what this show's all about.  This is what this accusation is on this show.  I thought I might have seen Buddy rooting around the fridge.  A Buddy root?  Buddy, the guy.  I don't know.  Buddy might have been rooting around him.  I heard a lot of clanging over in the fridge area.  And I was like, what's that? 
[02:32:30]  Could someone ask him?  Where is he?  He's the Oompa Loompa for the people that linger longer.  That's a long time.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Where is he?  Iraq's got something on the cherry.  Iraq?  Iraq, your testimony?  Iraq wasn't allowed to eat for 24 hours.  So he's safe.  And he's delirious.  Right.  One of our interns has stated that Buddy has a tendency to go through the fridge and throw  things out on just on random occasions.  How about we throw Buddy out with the garbage?  Why the fuck is he still here? 
[02:33:00]  If he fucking touched our stuff.  I was at the other facility.  It's beautiful.  Get the fuck out of here.  There's no reason for him.  This is the Opie and Anthony building at this point.  Why would it be?  Why does he do that?  Don't know, but he's been seen several times just wandering through the kitchen, filtering  through the drawers, throwing things out.  Can we call him right now?  Interesting, interesting.  Somebody call him right now.  Wake him up.  But the old milk is still in it, so it's just like...  Oh, what's this?  Pat Duffy. 
[02:33:30]  I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say, I didn't get the chance to before.  For the money honey contest, when I bought all the honey and put that in the fridge,  Buddy moved it the next day and gave it back to me by his desk.  Can we check the other fridge for the cherries?  Oh, all right.  Yeah, we checked every fridge.  Did you check everything?  Did you check by where Buddy works?  Yeah, I did.  I gave a pretty thorough look around.  In my humble opinion, he's a problem.  Why would he do that?  There's no reason he refuses to leave this facility.  He resents the fact...  Is he here today?  In my humble opinion, the guy is a problem, and why won't XM deal with this? 
[02:34:00]  Get his number.  I was over at the other joint.  It's beautiful.  It's right near Time Warner.  It's a whole facility.  Fucking...  I ran to all the guys we used to work with.  They're all happy over there.  I saw Bruce.  I saw Kane.  I saw Steve Kingston.  All these people.  They all have their own offices, and it's a nice little environment over there.  Why does he insist on being here?  We had to build a whole brand new studio around his fucking desk like they do in the projects  and stuff when they want to put up skyscrapers.  He won't leave because his boss won't leave. 
[02:34:30]  Who's his fucking boss?  Jonathan, who does most of the shows on the High Standards channel, won't go over to the  new place.  Why won't he go over to the new place?  Because he's arrogant.  I heard because he lives close.  Because he lives really close.  I hear because he lives close.  He's across the street.  I hear he lives close to here.  Guess what?  The new place is two blocks away.  It's not like it's downtown.  God almighty.  Soft, man.  May I say something?  Uh, Kenny, you have testimony? 
[02:35:00]  No, I just have a thought to ponder.  Maybe Buddy needed the cherries for his girlfriend to feel young again.  A fucking house fire.  I don't even know where you were fucking going with that, Kenny.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, call Buddy.  Yes, Mars, you have the number?  Call him and find out about the cherries.  We will accept your testimony through second party.  Absolutely.  Let's get him on the air.  Let's go to Cigars and Scotch.  Cigars and Scotch.  What's up?  Yeah, we want him on the air. 
[02:35:30]  Give it a try.  Before you start needlessly pointing fingers, perhaps maybe someone put the cherries in my  hiney.  Oh, wow.  That's a great impression.  Yeah, we didn't think that through.  Mein hiney.  Thank you, sir.  We got Eastside Dave on the line.  Eastside Dave.  Yeah, I would like to be a character witness against Buddy.  I'm sorry.  When we throw out newspapers, I see Buddy taking them out of the garbage and saving 
[02:36:00]  them.  Also, one time we had cake and Buddy, somehow his fingers had a bunch of frosting on them.  Exhibit B.  Exhibit C.  If you bring, the other day when you guys had some bagels and cakes and things, I saw  Buddy put a bunch of them in a plastic bag.  Exhibit D.  I've since gotten back at them when yesterday I ate Jonathan's meatball parm. 
[02:36:30]  Just the fucking fact that we have to deal with that crap.  You ate his meatball parm?  I don't think...  Yesterday at 3.30, I got a little sick and tired of the whole fucking thing.  Fucking, what's going on with the food?  So I ate a meatball parm.  Jonathan caught me and said, you know, what are you...  Is that my meatball parmesan?  And I said, I don't know whose it is.  I just ate it.  It's mine now. 
[02:37:00]  But Eastside Dave, so this is all true, though?  You've witnessed this stuff?  I've witnessed the fact that food magically disappears and appears.  And it only happens on days where, well, let's just say those little frumpy two guys happen to be working when we're off the work.  Right now, I would convict.  Really?  I would convict just based on this testimony alone.  I can't convict on it.  It's hearsay.  We need some corroboration.  Just watch the video. 
[02:37:30]  I don't care.  No, this is America.  I don't care.  This is America.  We got enough info.  Kill them.  Kill.  That would be it.  I can't stress enough how ridiculous this is.  We finally get XM to do the right thing and build us a huge facility, get rid of all the cubicles and stuff.  And two guys refused to leave.  Refused.  So they had to build around a cubicle.  They refused to put their foot down and just say move because certain people are friends with the big bosses or whatever.  And just get in their own refrigerator.  And it wasn't like they were moving to a dump. 
[02:38:00]  I mean, I would love to go to the other joint.  The other joint is beautiful.  That's where everybody else went.  All right.  Thank you, Dave.  All right.  By the way, I just want to say I was yelled at by my buddy last Wednesday for putting beer in the fridge.  Right.  He said that the beer would explode.  I don't know what kind of.  Explode.  For racks in refrigerators, we have that suddenly improv explosions.  But that's the way buddies think.  So he's guilty in my book.  Dave.  Thank you, guys.  Dave. 
[02:38:30]  By the way, Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  No, noon to three.  Well, you're a little late.  You're a little late.  Have fun getting your spanking today.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Take a bell to the head.  So he's fucking up our show now by throwing stuff out because he doesn't know what the fuck's going on.  If it was him.  Oh, it's him.  I think you're right.  I'm just saying it is.  I think he's not like OCD to me.  Yeah.  What's the OCD?  You know.  Get the.  Anyways, we got the great JBL outside the studio and he's promoting boners. 
[02:39:00]  So should we take a break and then bring him in or what?  What do you want to do?  I'm going to ease the tension, baby.  All right.  All right.  Sounds good.  A quick break.  We got JBL from the WWE.  He's got some juice that'll give you a hard on.  Boner juice.  Boner juice.  It's going to be a billionaire from this stuff.  And then we got who else is here?  Russell Peters is here.  Yes.  Which one is he?  Where's Russell?  I didn't see him.  I heard he was here.  He's filling out paperwork. 
[02:39:30]  He's filling out paperwork and he's.  They better not ask Russell.  They didn't ask you to fill out paperwork, did they?  He's not.  You have to fill out fucking paperwork?  They asked one of our guests to fill out paperwork?  For what?  He is the biggest comedian in the world, some people would say.  He's one of them, yeah.  I mean, Russell.  He's right up there and he's filling out paperwork to appear on this fucking radio show?  He fucking sold out.  That shouldn't even be on a college frequency at this point?  The Air Canada Center in Toronto two nights in a row.  But he's got to fill out paperwork.  Why?  Fucking. 
[02:40:00]  If he had to fill out paperwork, I'm going to fucking do nothing about it.  At least you're honest.  I shit talk and then I back up.  At least you're very honest.  I'm a fucking phony yeller.  That's good to know.  I'm a frightened man deep down.  Jimmy Bluster.  It's good to know we still have a lot of the same issues we had the first day we broadcast  it from Exxon.  It drives me nuts.  Amazing.  These fucking guys, they refuse to leave.  They don't like us.  We don't like them.  And out of principle, they're staying here.  I don't get it.  And now they're fucking up our radio show by throwing stuff out that we need. 
[02:40:30]  Maybe cherry darts isn't important to you, but guess what?  It's important to us.  Very.  And more people will listen to a show where they throw cherries at assholes than some  dumb old fucking Frank Sinatra song.  Hey, hey.  Oh, this Opie's ready.  Don't talk about the chairman of the board.  This Opie's ready for the future Opie.  Trust me.  Oh, I'm talking about the chairman of the board like that, though.  It's not his fault.  I challenge you, future Opie.  Yeah, take this Opie on.  Good luck.  Oh, oh, you mean future Opie coming back to you.  Because eventually we'll play these tapes, too. 
[02:41:00]  But guess what?  This Opie's ready for future Opie.  Not like that other fucking loser that was talking yesterday.  What if you become like born again and like you listen back and you're all regretful?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that'll happen.  That's not who I was at that time.  Yeah, that's going to happen.  Please.  That was before I found Jesus.  I'd rather fuck Sandy Kane and the anus.  All right, Sandy.  Ew, she just bent over.  That's okay.  Usually that's really hot.  Oh.  Oh, she was checking her hemorrhoid.  All right, JBL.  And my hemorrhoid. 
[02:41:30]  My hemorrhoid.  And Russell Peters is next.  No, we should do it.  We should drink this juice and then get Sandy Kane naked and see who pops the boner first.  Why?  Hey, hey.  Does it make you blind?  Does it make you blind?  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  We're back.  Back in the New York room.  Welcome back to the O.B.N. Anthony show. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  O.B.N. Anthony.  All right, this is going to get very interesting.  We got a lot of people outside on the bleachers. 
[02:42:30]  We got cherry darts that we're doing today.  Are you guys allowed to see nudity or is that bad for your career?  I like nudity.  All right, good.  Yeah, actually, I prefer it.  The girls are going to have cherries thrown at their assholes in about, depends, 15 minutes,  half hour.  It's called cherry darts.  They got their guy partners out there.  And then the girls kind of get on their knees and pull it all down.  And make sure they have a big target. 
[02:43:00]  A nice target.  And then the guys have to throw the cherry right in there.  Think darts.  It's like a game of hoops.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it's also, and it's promoted.  So it's sponsored.  All right.  How great is that?  And make sure Vince does it.  It's brought to you by low self-esteem.  Yeah.  And Vince is going to steal this.  You know that.  It's going to be part of like Ross.  We're going to play cherry darts.  That's right.  Pull those pants down.  Love the new angry Vince.  Yeah.  We also have to say hi to Russell Peters, one of the biggest comedians in all of the world. 
[02:43:30]  Hello there.  That's something.  I did not know that, by the way.  Title.  You're not missing anything.  Huh?  You're missing nothing.  You're missing nothing?  You're missing nothing.  Russell's interesting because we know Dane as being this guy who sells out arenas.  And Russell has a huge following here.  Because I didn't know who you were like years ago.  And then our friend told me.  He's like, no, he does like 5,000, 10,000 cedars here.  And it's amazing.  And it sells out in Singapore.  It really depresses me.  Like I'm kind of like.  I don't like all over the world.  You're Canadian, right?  That is.  I apologize in advance. 
[02:44:00]  No, no.  That's why.  Why would you sell out in like Singapore?  Like why are people in Singapore going, I gotta see Russell Peters?  I don't know.  I think I'm the first Indian guy out there.  So, you know, there's a.  I spread across like the whole all of Asia and then Africa and stuff like that.  Yeah.  There's a few people there.  Yeah.  In that Asia place.  If there's a clip to be removed, there's a Russell Peters ticket to be sold.  That's right.  I'm big at the Somalian shows.  You got some frequent flyer miles too, huh? 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I imagine you're flying ridiculous distances.  I'm doing Sydney Opera House next month.  Jesus.  That flight's gotta be what?  Two, three hours.  Perhaps longer than that, Ant.  I'm talking about Pesta Pum.  How big is Sydney Opera House?  I don't know.  It's just more of a landmark, you know?  Yeah.  I think it's only like.  Yeah, we've all seen a picture of it.  Like 4,000 seats.  It's supposed to look like billowing sails, I believe.  Oh, really?  It probably sucks inside.  It probably smells.  All I remember is.  The toilet's back up.  A very little kid watching Carol Burnett do a show live from there. 
[02:45:00]  Really?  It's like, shit.  Kangaroo shit in the lobby.  The wall is all over the place.  I want to get to JBL from the WWE.  We love this guy.  You're hilarious on the mic.  I mean.  I will thank you.  Your wrestling is good, too, obviously.  And I like the fact that you know stocks.  I mean, that blew me away when I'm like, wait.  This guy that kind of acts.  At the time, he kind of acted a little stupid in the ring.  I had to say that very carefully.  You notice that? 
[02:45:30]  And then all of a sudden, he's like.  Very educated in the world of finance.  Yeah, he's like this stock analyst.  And I'm like, nah, who's going to take this guy seriously?  But Wall Street takes this guy seriously.  What were you on?  Like Squawk Box they put you on?  Squawk Box, now work for Fox Business.  Yeah.  It's like being the bravest Frenchman.  You know, being the smartest wrestler.  The comps are easy.  We have to keep the Nazis out.  There's only eight of us.  How funny is that?  We know a little thing or two about stocks ourselves there. 
[02:46:00]  We've delved into the world of the market.  Sure.  Not recently.  It's been a couple of years now.  We're offered an IPO.  And we're very excited because I like getting in on the ground floor of certain stocks.  I wish, like I said before, Google would have been a nice one.  And we got in on a little stock called Citadel.  That's right.  Citadel Broadcasting. 
[02:46:30]  You know.  Of which we broadcast on a couple of their stations.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got in on the IPO.  Ground floor.  19 bucks a share.  Media stocks.  Yeah.  Media stocks.  Absolutely.  That is good.  And we were told, ground floor.  We weren't told that the building had 18 floors of basement when we got in because it is now  at what?  Well, it's at a, this is good.  This is what you want to, you know, see. 
[02:47:00]  19 bucks a share.  This is what you want to see in your stock.  It's down to $1.45 there, JBL.  Sell.  And by the way, we didn't just take a couple shares.  Outstanding.  Oh, we.  Yeah, we.  I can't tell you how many times we heard, this is a guarantee.  You'll be retired in a couple of years.  And then you'll just do radio for fun.  Yeah.  Thanks.  Thanks for nothing.  Now, where'd you get this tip?  Gomez Adams?  Yeah.  Out of the ticker?  Yeah.  That ticker in his living room.  No, that was through one of our bosses there, Fareed. 
[02:47:30]  Yep.  With the Citadel.  But, you know, obviously, that's not coming back.  I can't see that coming back.  It's like the old broker says, if you liked it at 19, you'll love it.  At $1.45.  See, what we should do is buy it at $1.45.  No, because it'll probably go down to $0.45.  It can't go any lower, though.  I'm thinking of just taking the hit.  Yeah.  And, you know, use it against my gains.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Hey, JBL, you got a new product there?  Got a new product.  MamaJuana.  MamaJuanaEnergy.com.  It's been made in the Dominican for about 500 years.  The Tano Indians made it before Columbus.  It's a legendary drink down there.  They call it Liquid Viagra.  That's what we got.  We got Boner Juice, just like you called it.  Boner Juice.  Boner Juice.  Yes, sir.  It's all natural two-ounce energy shot that is virility in a bottle.  So you drink that down, and then how long?  About 10 to 15 minutes. 
[02:48:30]  What do you mean is your cock after your drink?  The last couple times I measured it, about 10, 15 minutes.  Well, I am more than willing to try this stuff.  Here's the problem.  I'm hanging out with kids today, and that's the God's honest truth.  Well, you don't want to be...  I can't be walking around like the zoo and stuff.  Give it to them.  Rock.  Give it to them.  Put it in their little juicy cups.  But someone's got to try this stuff out.  How long does it last?  You'll try it?  About 12 hours.  About 12 hours?  Yeah. 
[02:49:00]  Wow, that's a hell of a boner.  Pat Duff, you want to try some Boner Juice?  Sure.  Yes, you do.  Pat Duff, he'll do anything.  I'll do.  He's going to make his little Amish beard stand up.  Did you meet JBL?  No, I didn't.  From WWE.  How are you?  Pleasure.  And is this going everywhere, this juice?  Yeah, we're selling on our website right now, mamajuanaenergy.com.  We've had a bunch of meetings with retail stores.  We want to keep control of it, so we're going to sell it mainly on our website, and then  probably sign a deal with some retail stores pretty soon.  Wow.  Does this make you...  Let me ask you, because I've taken stuff like this before.  Does it upset your stomach at all? 
[02:49:30]  Not at all.  What's in it, like, roughly?  Maca is the main ingredient, Siberian ginseng, green tea extract.  It's the combination of all the above.  Okay.  Sounds sexy.  Yeah, it smells good.  Does the caffeine accelerate your shit process?  Not that I've noticed.  Coffee makes me just like...  It flies out of my ass after coffee.  Yeah.  Do you ever have the Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee?  It really doesn't matter.  I've got to drink that shit on the toilet.  Imagine sitting there on a toilet, you're shitting with a powerful erection. 
[02:50:00]  That'd be the greatest drug ever.  Honey, get in here.  I've got a good news and bad news.  Well, let's let Pat Duffy drink some, and whoever else wants to.  You're debating?  Oh, yeah, man.  Pass me one of those, though, Jimmy.  There you go.  Give me one.  I'll try it later.  I'll give you a full report.  Jimmy gets rods, though.  Jimmy gets rods...  Pretty consistently.  Yeah, well, that's like the...  Just sitting here.  That's the Cialis wearing off.  He just kind of gets a little...  But this is better, because the question I asked, because anyone that's taken Viagra, 
[02:50:30]  Cialis, Levitro, all they do is they...  The main problem with them is you get sometimes a pounding headache, and they fuck your sinuses  up.  Because that's the way it works.  It's just...  Whatever it does, it messes your sinuses up.  And it gives you the red face, right?  Yes.  I don't get the red face.  You don't?  No, I'm brown.  All right.  Yeah, he doesn't get the red face.  He doesn't get the sinus thing from us.  You don't know he's having a problem until he fucking just grabs his chest and his hard  dick snaps into the fucking floor.  The best game of play is when you go out to dinner on a Friday night or whatever in 
[02:51:00]  Manhattan, and you just look around the room and guess who's on Viagra.  It is so obvious.  You've got these older guys that are just beet fucking red.  Oof.  That doesn't sound very good.  Oh, yeah.  Cialis?  I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Will this be a bad combo if I took Cialis, or no?  I wouldn't think so, no.  It's all natural.  It's not going to hurt you.  I mean, no matter what you're taking with it, it's good.  It's all natural, pal.  It's all natural.  Yeah.  All right, Pat Duffy, why don't you drink it?  We'll check in with you in about 10 or 15 minutes. 
[02:51:30]  All right, there goes Pat Duffy.  Yeah, drinking that down.  You drink it all?  You slam it down?  Oh, my God, no.  A capful.  Jesus.  What did you do?  He's going to look like he saw the arc.  He's going to have no fucking, like, he's going to be all wrinkled and all the blood.  He's going to have, like, a fucking nice six-foot erection.  Hey, long way to go for that weak joke.  Sorry.  What does it taste like, Pat?  It's like a fruit punch.  Really?  Yeah, it's good.  It's not bad.  And it's called Mama Juana.  We should spell it.  M-A-M-A-J-U-A-N-A dot com? 
[02:52:00]  MamaJuanaEnergy.com.  Yes.  Energy.com.  Okay.  Cool.  You want to try some?  It's good.  There's nothing left.  It's all gone.  Wait, you only bought that much?  Well, he didn't want to have a dick party, I guess.  Yeah, Jesus.  I was a little worried.  Come on.  Do we have any more for you, Ruck?  I had one sip of this.  You want to?  You're going to have mine.  Take Opus, because he can't do it today.  Just show him a burger or he'll get a rod.  We only...  We got...  Look, I understand you can't give away the farm. 
[02:52:30]  He brought four, I think.  He brought a little...  No, I brought six.  A teeny six-pack.  It's so cute.  It's like a little box with six small little two-ounce bottles in it.  I got in at 4.30 in the morning.  I'm doing good just to be alive today.  Guy knows about finance.  He knows how many to bring in.  He certainly does.  So I want to get cut into his bottom line there.  Yeah, we're not going to have a problem with JBL, are we there, Jimmy?  Yeah, what's the matter, Jimmy?  Of course I'm not going to have a problem with JBL.  Want to start a fight with him?  Yeah, you certainly don't.  You're the crazy bastard.  Don't hit me with his dick. 
[02:53:00]  Apparently, we know he's fucking revved up and ready to go.  No, but this stuff is going to blow you.  He's going to hit you up with his cock.  Like a baby seal.  You can hit you up with the head with it.  If this doesn't give you a headache and stuff and clog your sinuses, man, this is a great  alternative for the drugs because I love them.  I love having just a fucking powerful cock, but the sinuses...  True, it gives you that confidence.  Yeah, it really does.  No matter what you do.  You really take the Viagra and stuff, huh?  Not all the time, but every now and then, if I think I've jerked off too many times in  one day, I...  How come the people that put out the Viagra and stuff at the beginning, when it first 
[02:53:30]  came out with saying, now, people, unless you have erectile dysfunction, this will do  nothing for you.  Remember that whole ruse that they had going?  Because I think they understood that as soon as you hear that it just gets your dick hard,  it was going to be fucking balls to the wall fake shrimps.  You know what I mean?  Who's not going to want this stuff?  Yeah.  Dr. Nicopolis and Elvis.  I mean, this is what everybody's going to be using their connections for.  They were barbiturates.  Boners.  They envisioned people just pulling off and having sex in the road, just all hell breaking 
[02:54:00]  loose if the common man was going to take you to the stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  I was reading your bio there, and you had a little problem in Germany.  Yeah.  This is a small one.  What happened in Germany?  What were you doing?  Denying something, I hope.  No, no, no.  I love this one, though.  The character JBL was a very racist character.  Sure.  Eddie Guerrero was a dear friend of mine, and some of the most horrible stuff I did was 
[02:54:30]  to Eddie Guerrero, and against all the Mexican people, illegal immigrants, all that different  stuff.  In fact, I stole most of my promos I did in the ring from Pat Buchanan.  I swear to God.  I swear to God.  I did one of Pat Buchanan's speeches, basically in the ring, and people were going,  you what an asshole.  That's great.  So I was in Germany.  It's something I had done for years.  It's something wrestlers had done over there.  Prince Von Erich, Baron Von Raske.  I did a Nazi salute to get the people all pissed off at me, and to make them cheer for 
[02:55:00]  Eddie.  And CNBC, somebody emailed them, said they didn't appreciate it, and they ended up firing  me over it, and I ended up being called a Nazi in the New York Post.  It's like a character that you're doing.  So why is that different from an actor doing it in a movie?  It's no different than Anthony Hopkins playing Hannibal Lecter.  Fred Flintstone isn't real, and some of these dumb son of a bitches, they took the thing  and said that I did it, which was not true as a character. 
[02:55:30]  So the German audience did a good job of faking that they were offended?  Yes.  Actually, the thing was, they weren't that offended.  It had been done so much over there for so many years that they weren't even phased by it.  It was some internet reporter had written CNBC, so they were organizing a protest against  the company, and that's how the whole thing came around.  Isn't it illegal to even do that over there?  It's illegal if you do it as a, not as part of entertainment.  Oh, okay.  So like if you were Sergeant Schultz or something, John Banner, it's not illegal. 
[02:56:00]  So the guy and the producers, the gay Nazi, for entertainment, he could do it.  But if you're standing around with a bunch of skinheads around a burning fire and a burning  cross, you could do it.  If you do it and you're facing Poland, that could be an issue.  How do they have cabs over there?  They probably have to just put a pinky up and neatly stand there.  Hello, cab.  That's just such bullshit that you get fired over that, though.  But I mean, you landed on your feet.  You're now with Fox News. 
[02:56:30]  I'm back with Fox.  Very excited about that.  It was, you know, honestly, it was a gutless deal by those guys.  Fox loves that.  It was gutless.  Yeah, of course Fox loves it.  He said it was gutless.  I like that.  Because most people go, well, you know, they had to do what they had to do.  What can I tell you?  No, you know, honestly.  I'm glad that you're saying it's gutless because it is.  It was total bullshit what they did.  You know, Vince McMahon called him and said, like, this is one internet reporter writing  you guys.  It's not a big deal.  Just tell it was a character that he portrayed.  They had seen all the stuff I'd done with Eddie, which was actually more offensive than 
[02:57:00]  what I did in Germany.  Yeah.  And they were fine with that.  They just buckled under the pressure and put me out as a scapegoat.  Because that's the character.  It's like, that's what your character is.  It was totally character.  It was all in character.  I try to tell people the same thing.  My character here on this program, I like the era.  I like the World War II era.  I like collecting certain things.  But I am called a Nazi constantly. 
[02:57:30]  Well, I mean.  What?  Maybe they listen to the show.  I live amongst the Jews.  I mean.  My neighborhood is combined.  I'm the only one that had Christmas decorations.  I think the Nazis lived amongst the Jews as well.  Yeah.  I hear tell for a while anyway.  You're just like the skinhead that grows his hair in, so he blends in.  That's all.  There's a.  And okay.  Occasionally, I'll hold up.  I have a Hitler action figure on Pal Talk.  I'll hold that up and make him march around.  A lot of books on the era. 
[02:58:00]  Hitler around the house.  But, you know.  I'm just.  JBL is going to leave.  You're building a V2 rocket in the basement.  You're going to chase JBL over here.  I just catch a lot of flack for it.  But I'm a fan of the era.  Yeah.  All right.  You know.  Everything.  Also, JBL told the kids there was no Santa.  I did tell the kids there were no Santa.  That rocks.  Yeah, I did.  We did that bit.  Sam said he was at that show.  Were you at the show, Sam?  How did it go down? 
[02:58:30]  Well, it was like an afternoon house show in White Plains.  And so it was packed full of kids and families.  Because it was like a weekend afternoon.  It wasn't nighttime.  And so he just comes out to the ring and he does like a five-minute promo.  It was right before Christmas.  Yeah.  No, it was like the 27th, I think.  So it was two days after Christmas.  Two days after they praise Santa in their home.  Yeah.  He's like, I know we're just getting over.  And he's like, but I want you to know there is no Santa Claus.  It's your parents.  It was the best. 
[02:59:00]  And what did the kids do?  Kids were crying.  Mothers were booing.  Really?  Yeah.  The reaction was immediate?  Yeah.  It was right away.  Oh, that's fantastic.  But once people were actually booing the bad guy like they're supposed to.  I don't watch wrestling anymore, but you can bet I have just found a favorite new wrestler.  He's the best.  He fucking loves it.  He fucking zig-hiled.  He sells fucking dick juice.  And he hates kids.  He's three for three. 
[02:59:30]  Soon I'll be like Ozzy and just kill animals on stage.  Oh, and another one of my fucking heroes.  Absolutely.  Huge Ozzy fan.  He loves the Ozzy.  That's pretty good.  So besides the dick juice, what are you doing as far as WWE is concerned?  I just returned to the ring after about a two-year layoff.  Broke my back about three years ago.  Had to retire.  Back's gotten better.  I just returned last Sunday.  First match back I had in two years.  Wow.  How did that feel?  It felt okay.  Unfortunately, it's high-definition television now. 
[03:00:00]  When you're a 41-year-old and pretty fat, it's not good.  Oh, shit.  You know, when I was 25 and in great shape, they had this grainy television picture.  Now it's high-def, and I've got to be out there without a shirt.  So it's not good.  It's not good at all.  I love the honesty, man.  You've got to make some peck juice.  How do you break your back, by the way?  What actually breaks when you break your back?  Is it the...  What is it?  I broke a vertebra right in half.  So it is the vertebrae.  Yeah.  Was there a threat of paralysis, or was it the wrong one? 
[03:00:30]  No, it wasn't a paralysis deal at all.  The vertebrae just snapped.  So it wasn't actually that big a deal.  It's just...  It caused a lot of complications, and it took me a while to get over.  And you can go back in and wrestle again with a...  You're not afraid of, like, you know, ending up in a chair?  No, apparently I have no more risk of getting hurt than I did before.  God bless you.  That's called an alpha male, by the way.  You break your back and then go,  God damn, this pesky back.  I just want to fight again.  Fucking...  Is that the worst injury you ever had?  Pretty much. 
[03:01:00]  I tore a bicep one time, and that was probably the most painful, but the back was...  I have eczema, and I don't get out of bed on some days.  The greatest injury story ever was Triple H explaining how...  What muscle was it?  Oh, it was his calf.  No, his quad.  His quad.  Oh, right, right.  He tore his quad off the bone.  He tore his quad off the bone, and then it rolled up like a shade all the way up his leg.  Yeah, and he finished the match.  Did he really?  Yeah.  Finished the match.  Wrestled about probably five or ten minutes past that. 
[03:01:30]  It was a pain.  I would not.  I would imagine, yeah.  Yeah, it could be.  It could be painful.  I would have finished the match.  Since they counted finishing the match, putting me on a stretcher while I screamed on the  way to the hospital, if that counted as the match.  Like a woman.  Like a woman, exactly.  Fucking amazing.  I don't know why I'm acting like I should understand this mentality, either.  You guys have a whole way about you.  It's like mixed martial artists, guys.  Just guys that are fucking like physical.  It's called being a man.  It's even more than being a man.  Something we'll never know. 
[03:02:00]  Nah, that's like a fucking man squared.  That's like what men want to be.  It's depressing.  That's my genetic competition.  If a girl has to be fucked to reproduce, she has to look at both of us and make a decision.  That's the end of Norton's as we know it.  Fucking finish.  And you're going to be fighting Jericho and a bunch of other guys, right?  Yeah.  No way out?  Yeah, no way out.  Coming up February 17th, Elimination Chamber. 
[03:02:30]  Chris Jericho, Jeff Hardy is versus Sean Macho.  Elimination Chamber match.  The dreaded Elimination Chamber.  What is that one again?  It's basically a cage they've built just for this one particular match.  The problem is nothing gives in the thing.  I mean, it's, you know, what's the worst thing about wrestling is when you get the shit knocked  out of you and it doesn't look like you get the shit knocked out of you.  You know, it's bad enough when you get hurt.  Right.  But when it doesn't look like you get hurt, that's worse.  Yeah.  So this thing doesn't give.  So you hit it, it hurts. 
[03:03:00]  But since it doesn't give, people think, ah, it's not that big a deal.  Yeah, it doesn't look like you're really impacting it.  That's right.  When someone grabs you, spins you around and throws you into it.  Right.  You got something that gives, that moves when you hit it.  People go, ah, wow, that's something.  Well, that's what you want.  Do you guys ever like, remember like when Herman Munster was wrestling and the guy goes,  remember that?  He goes, look, I got a bunch of kids.  Just let me win this one.  Remember when Herman was, do you guys ever lean over and go, look, not the fucking back.  Do you ever do that?  Go, listen, I broke my back.  Little chit-chats in the ring. 
[03:03:30]  Do you talk while you're wrestling or just.  Yeah, it's pretty much no, you know, before you go out there, if you got some injury or  something, it's, you know, not something you pretty much have to tell them, but.  Right.  Do you feel like the WWE is starting to get edgier again?  I think so.  Like, N and I were huge fans of the WWF when they were just completely out of control with  their storylines where you didn't even give a shit about the wrestling anymore.  You really didn't.  I don't know who was writing for the show, but it was hilarious.  When What's-Her-Name gave birth to The Hand or whatever it was.  I'm like, how far are they going to go with this shit? 
[03:04:00]  And then, I guess it was the Janet Jackson thing, unfortunately, really fucked up everybody.  And Vince pulled way, way back.  But it seems like he's starting to push.  Since that Janet Jackson do your ride.  He's pushing the envelope again, it looks like.  People have been scared to death to do anything.  They were showing tit on the live shows.  Basically, yeah.  They were showing tit.  You'd be watching TV and go, wait, wait, wait.  And you'd go to the internet, and people would freeze frame it and cap it.  Yeah, way before Janet Jackson misunderstood that, you know, a little slippage, you know. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, no one's going to do anything.  You can explain that, but after Janet Jackson, you couldn't, certainly.  But they had all sorts of storylines.  People having sex at hotels.  Yeah.  It was just amazing.  It was just all about sex.  It was unbelievable.  It was great.  But it seems like that is coming back.  It's coming back, which is nice to see.  Yeah, the fun storylines.  The people like the edgy stuff.  You know, Stone Cold brought a lot of that in.  Oh, yeah.  That was him.  Yep.  And we rode Steve for a long time.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it was a lot of fun storylines. 
[03:05:00]  And they are coming back.  And our own Sam keeps us updated, which is nice.  He's one of the biggest fans.  And I just liked the fact that he knew the exact date that you told the kids there was no Santa.  You're like, yeah, it was like before Christmas.  No, no, it was two days after.  It was the 27th.  27th.  Isn't there a wrestler fighting in UFC this weekend?  Huh?  Isn't there a UFC?  That's right.  Brock Lesnar's fighting Frank Mir, UFC Saturday night.  You think he's going to get his ass kicked?  Don't know.  Frank is a great submission guy. 
[03:05:30]  I think Brock is a lot stronger.  I don't know.  Brock's an animal.  Yeah.  You can just tell he was an animal.  But is he a martial artist or just a wrestler?  I don't know.  That's what you need.  He was a national champion.  And apparently he wanted easy.  So I think Brock's got a real shot.  If I were Brock, I wouldn't have taken Frank Mir right off the bat.  You know, that guy's a former world champion.  I would take something easier.  Is he a striker?  Because I would think that a wrestler would have problems with a guy like a Liddell, unless  he grabs him.  Because, or like Kevin Randallman, is it like, you follow MMA at all?  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  He's a great fucking strong wrestling guy.  But if you clock him hard enough, I mean, those guys are used to...  Liddell makes a point of not getting himself trapped like that if somebody tries to take  him down.  I've seen Liddell over people, beating him as they're laying on the ground, and then  back off.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't want the guy grabbing him and pulling him back down.  He'd rather beat him in the face, let him get back up, and beat him in the face a  little more.  I think he likes watching people fall down.  Tito tried to get him on the ground.  And Liddell stood up with Tito on him and just threw him off. 
[03:06:30]  He's a very fucking powerful dude.  But there are guys that are probably as good a wrestler.  Yeah.  So you think that he has a shot?  I think he's got a great shot.  The thing that concerns me about Frank Mir is he's a great submission guy.  And Brock's not used to that in his background, being an amateur wrestler.  Mir's not a great striker.  You know, anybody can knock somebody out, but he's not a great striker.  So the longer it goes, the more it favors Brock.  Mir tends to gas early.  So Brock's got a, he's a cardioaholic.  He'll be okay if they can get past the first couple minutes. 
[03:07:00]  But is he used to dealing with, like you said, the submissions, those arm bars and all  that stuff?  I mean, it's like, I mean, it's like stuff that you guys wouldn't deal with on a regular  basis at work, like where, oh shit, my arm's about to be snapped if I don't tap.  Yeah.  Well, wrestlers learn all that shit, don't you?  Yeah, Mir broke a guy's arm a couple years ago in an arm bar.  Did the guy tap and he just didn't listen or the guy wouldn't tap?  He just snapped it.  Literally snapped it.  I mean, Rudd, just as soon as he hooked him, he snapped his arm.  It happens fast, too, because sometimes you're watching a match and it doesn't look like 
[03:07:30]  anything's really happening.  And the guy's like, whoa, hey.  You're like, what the fuck just happened?  You look at slow motion and you go, oh, I see.  You're hoping the ref is ready to be ripped out of the socket.  You're hoping the ref pays attention.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, the ref's not looking at a pretty girl in the audience as you're trying  to tap out before your arm snaps.  Well, the other guy will see it, too, and hopefully not.  Yeah.  Be a pro.  I mean, you're fucking finished.  Yeah, hopefully.  And you don't see it coming at the time.  The announcers will see it coming.  But I'm watching sometimes and Rogan's like, oh, my God, he's getting him into something.  And I had no idea he was getting him into something next. 
[03:08:00]  You know, the guy's slapping the ground.  And Rogan knows it.  He certainly does.  That little fucking hairy knuckle savage.  You know Joe Rogan?  He's a fucking comedian slash should have been a rapist.  He's a fucking animal.  He's an animal.  The guy.  We love Rogan.  Absolutely.  He's a problem.  We miss him.  Fucking Cro-Magnon.  Fucking savage.  He knows more about drugs than any human alive, too, by the way.  Really?  Yep.  Yep.  He has educated himself on everything.  Drugs and kicking ass.  Everything.  He mentions drugs that no one else knows about yet. 
[03:08:30]  Right?  Yeah.  He knows the chemical composition, how they fuck you up, why they do.  But what you should stay away from, I don't know, whatever.  Would you be nervous if you had to fight Liddell?  You're a big dude, a very strong guy.  Obviously, you can take care of yourself very well.  Yeah.  Liddell's the guy you worry about because he hits so hard.  You know, that guy like Liddell can, I would be nervous if Brock were fighting a guy like  that because I don't know what kind of chin Brock's got.  I think he's got a terrific one.  But we don't know that until he gets hit. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  You don't know until you get punched in that chin, man.  Right.  I think Brock will be fine.  You know, if he can just get past the first few minutes with Frank, I think he'll be  okay.  It's going to be interesting.  A lot of people are talking about it.  Yeah.  He's getting slammed in the face like that.  Brock is a genetic freak.  The guys, there's nothing like this guy.  But I can tell you, Mir doesn't want to lose to a wrestler.  A wrestler, yeah.  You know, I saw Randy Couture do a big interview about Brock.  I'll call him the old WWE guy.  You know, apparently Couture wants to fight him, it looks like. 
[03:09:30]  But nobody wants to lose to Brock.  No, no.  So Mir's going to come in in great shape.  It should be a hell of a fight.  And I hope Brock beats the shit out of him.  I can see it.  Well, I tell you, everybody's probably watching this.  Boxers and everything.  Of course.  Because they want to see how is it when you see.  Because Mitch Marshallard scares everybody.  Because the boxers are great.  Tyson can knock anybody out with one shot.  But they're just going to grab him by the waist, put him on the ground, and fucking twist  his foot until he slaps.  I mean, he's no shot at punching you.  So I bet you everybody's going to be watching this one really closely to see how it works. 
[03:10:00]  Good.  I just added nothing.  You added a lot.  Speech.  I like that.  MamaWannaEnergy.com.  Yes.  We didn't really talk about it that much.  That's okay.  Because there's a bunch of guys.  It would be kind of cool if there were some hot girls around.  Well, we should get knocked up here.  Let's find out.  Let's see.  Who's tweaked up?  Yeah, who else drank it?  Jimmy?  There's girls.  No, I took one sip, but I still have salus for me after that.  Pat, anything going on yet?  No, but I feel like I have a whole lot of energy that I don't know what to do with.  Get me close.  I have one suggestion. 
[03:10:30]  That's you.  I feel like I could run around the block a couple times, but I don't have a boner or anything.  Well, you need to be.  Well, you need some sexual thoughts, too, right?  Yeah, you need some fucking something.  And we're actually glad right now you don't have a boner.  Yeah.  You're in a room full of men.  What do you suggest there, JB?  There's girls.  Maybe once their anuses start showing.  Any girl want to get naked out there to see if Pat Duffy gets an instant boner?  We need something.  We need something.  Some sort of stimuli.  Ladies?  Where are the girls?  Where'd the girls go? 
[03:11:00]  They took the girls away.  Are they still filling out forms?  They're smoking?  They're all smoking.  They're getting their vaginas ready.  There's a girl right there.  Honey.  All right.  There you go.  Oh, fuck.  If you can do this, this stuff really works.  This is the anti-boner.  Hold on.  Let me explain to JBL.  JBL.  If Pat Duffy gets a boner now, you are going to become a billionaire.  Yes, he'll do it.  You'll have to rename this Moses Juice.  I look better in the dark.  Will you shut up?  What is it for you?  This is the IP. 
[03:11:30]  Ugh.  Hey, Jim.  And E-Rock, of course, thanks for just throwing a mic in front of her because you're paying attention.  E-Rock's starving.  He's very cute, by the way.  Oh, stop.  E-Rock is?  Beautiful eyes.  E-Rock?  Are you well in Dad?  Why don't you just feel it?  Are you well in Dad?  Grab his cock.  I'm fine.  Yeah, grab that cock.  She grabs his cock.  That's what I used to do in the strip clubs.  Instead of, like, shaking someone's hand, you'd just go over to his penis and go, hi, how are you?  Where are you from?  At the speakeasies.  The speakeasies.  The vaudevillian.  What was his dancing name? 
[03:12:00]  Dusty Drapes?  Sorry.  I had to throw it out.  Dusty.  Why would you yell at Sandy like that?  She's a nice girl.  Yeah, she's very nice.  It's my fault.  Why are you taking that?  All right, how are we going to do this?  How do I take that?  Hey, you have to sometimes, you know?  It's embarrassing that I actually recognize her.  It's better than showing my asshole.  You want to show...  Because my hemorrhoid's out today.  You want to show JBL your asshole?  I did check, because I know there's a concept.  I don't usually look at my asshole in the morning, but I did check.  You were a true enchantress. 
[03:12:30]  Steve said, you know, you have to show your ass, so I checked, and my hemorrhoid was like...  All right, let's get Pat Duffy a little closer.  I had Mexican food last night.  Yeah, I know.  You say that every time you're in here.  Come up with something.  Can we see it, though?  Pat Duffy, because Pat Duffy's an ass freak.  He actually does have a thing for you in a weird way.  I don't deny it, but he does.  He's not a bad-looking man.  No, he's not a square-jawed...  What are you doing later?  Let's exchange blood tests.  You do that line every time.  Oh, my God.  Boy, you just stick to the basics.  You have to check a man out, or do you? 
[03:13:00]  No.  Lock it.  We'll just take a shot.  Lock it.  Can we get...  We need Pat Duffy over there.  The pussy or the ass?  What?  I mean, what?  He looks like a pussy type.  All right, just share mics.  That's fine.  He doesn't look like the type that would like the ass that much.  No, he's an ass freak.  He's an ass freak.  Okay.  All right, Sandy.  What?  You got to get naked.  Totally naked?  Pat Duffy is on the mama...  I mean...  Juana juice.  Energy juice. 
[03:13:30]  Marijuana?  Oh, you dunce.  I would love some.  So would everyone who has to look at you.  Did I take 10 Vicodin's for the show for nothing, or what?  Sandy, just take it all off.  We don't have four hours.  Just take it all off.  Yeah, we see that.  It's a heart.  It's a cat.  It's a black pussy.  Black pussy.  That's cute.  We see the black pussy cat.  You like black pussy?  No.  Give me the girl...  Come on.  You like black pussy, don't you?  I don't doubt it.  Isn't your girlfriend black?  Oh.  Okay, hey.  I thought she was.  My girlfriend? 
[03:14:00]  Maybe she just came back from Miami.  No, she's a Spanish tranny.  Come on, take your clothes off.  She's a spanny.  She, uh...  There goes Sandy Cain.  Is that white today?  Oh, I'm going to go with the stamps.  White.  Oh, jeez.  By the way, Fox is listening.  JBL has left the studio.  Okay.  He's very cute, though.  Very good looking man.  Isn't he opi...  I mean, he is an answer to me.  He's just gorgeous.  Have you had plastic surgery or something?  Clothes off.  Doesn't he look like he's that heavy?  You shut the fuck up. 
[03:14:30]  You're wasting time.  He has a very good looking face.  He looked good as a woman.  He's the lowest stripper ever.  Oh, yeah.  Why is there money falling in there already?  Real sexy way to take your pants off.  I did the cab driver on the way down.  It's like the way every guy takes his pants off.  Hey, the good news is the money's still driving.  You step on the leg.  Wado loves Anthony, man.  You know?  You named it.  You named it.  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, you didn't show Russell.  Never saw that.  It was really hard being a fucking stripper when I had Wado.  Show her. 
[03:15:00]  Show Russell.  Show Russell.  It was really embarrassing.  Show Russell.  So I would kind of dance like that.  Here's the tough part.  Making her listen.  Senator.  What?  Show Russell's water, please.  Okay.  Just look.  I can see it from here.  Oh, that's gross.  Yeah.  Oh, that's gross.  Yeah.  No Weinstein.  What?  That's like how to get ahead in advertising.  It's like we don't know what it is.  We think it's some kind of genital wart.  But they had doctors once that said I had cancer.  I would die the next day.  And I'm still here.  The next day?  Remember you had a doctor show? 
[03:15:30]  No, we don't.  You had a doctor show.  You are a babbling, babbling buffoon.  No, you had a fucking doctor show.  And they all examined it.  They said, this is it for you.  You're going to die.  And I'm still here.  That was like about five years ago.  Did I get naked?  Okay.  Okay.  Please.  All right.  Pat Duff.  Pat.  Oh, God.  I'm a little nervous.  Oh, the horror.  Is my hemorrhoid out?  Is my hemorrhoid out?  Look at it.  Did I lie?  Open it up.  We can't see.  Open it up.  Is my hemorrhoid out?  Open it up. 
[03:16:00]  We can't see.  I did see it this morning.  Open it up, Sandy.  She's the worst.  Get in there, Pat.  Right there.  I need some music, man.  I need some music.  Give it a good sniff.  Pat Duffy has a line?  Get out of here.  My chick's going to get so pissed.  Why?  At this?  Your chick is going to get pissed?  You brush your teeth with dog shit and kiss her.  Very insecure.  You know what her asshole looks like?  It looks like the mouth on the planet that the Millennium Falcon landed in. 
[03:16:30]  No.  Too obscure?  No, I know exactly what you're talking about.  I'm with you too, Jimmy.  A tip in here.  Ugh.  All right.  Yeah, of a shotgun.  Move my vibrator.  She wants, like...  For the rest of the day, I'm not accepting 50s.  For the rest of my life.  Who wants a body?  She might be on the off chance.  She wants us to ooh and ah, and it's not going to happen.  Well, I'm not.  What the hell's about, like, ooh and ah?  I mean, I'm used to being used.  Danny, what's wrong?  Danny's, like, kind of cringing over there.  I mean...  She's an awful flat ass.  There's just nothing happening there. 
[03:17:00]  She's got, like, a guy's hair.  And she squats like she's taking a shit in the woods.  I mean, it's a great fucking ass.  Let me see it.  But it's like, you have to really know how to do it like strippers.  Yeah, that's a great ass.  All right.  Seems like you do.  She squats like she's shitting in the woods.  She has such a beautiful big pussy, too.  It's not sexy.  Unfortunately, it's on her.  She has a nice vagina.  It's called gravity.  You really think she has a nice vagina, Jimmy?  Yeah, it's fat.  I like a fat one.  That would be nice.  Big fat pussy.  It's a lot of hair.  Oh, you know, it's been in there.  It's got a suicide knob on it. 
[03:17:30]  I want to drive over it with a riding mower.  It's fucking horrendous.  Oh, Pat.  Well, how's that boner?  It's nowhere to be seen.  Apparently, it's in the front today.  It's in the front?  Yeah, the hemorrhoid.  That's my hemorrhoid.  It just moves around.  What do you think, gorgeous?  I think before electricity, you were probably high.  But after Mama Joanna, you'll be great again.  Okay, here's some marijuana.  Not marijuana, you dummy.  Oh, Marijuana.  Oh, I wish you'd go over Phil Spector's house. 
[03:18:00]  Holy shit.  She's not Phil Spector?  She was part of it.  I was raped by Phil Spector.  She was raped by Phil Spector.  I need a very small dick.  Wow.  She was part of the Phil Spector trial, actually.  Yes.  She's saying she was raped by him.  I don't know.  I don't feel like getting sued, because it's her.  I was 20 years old, so I definitely was.  All right.  Should we start to...  Oh, can I just tell you one thing?  Richard Pryor?  You had Sylvester Stallone on?  Yes, we do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So I just wanted...  Could I tell you a story we have? 
[03:18:30]  His bodyguards beat me up years ago at the Sherry Netherland Hotel.  Did they think you were a piece of meat that he was supposed to be hitting in the locker room?  Well, he's a real dick, you know.  He was really...  You're right after Rocky, and he invited me up to a party, and Jeff Wald was there, his  manager, totally naked, with two naked strippers, snorting cocaine, and having sex, and then  Sly said to me, he said, you know, all women are bitches, and I said, hey, you know, you  shouldn't say that, and he said to his two bodyguards, hey, get her the fuck out of here. 
[03:19:00]  So they both picked me up, man, and threw me down, and sort of beat me up, and then opened  the door and threw me the fuck out of the Sherry Netherland.  That was Sylvester Stallone.  Wish they were here now.  She's proud of her stories.  She has some of her stories of being beaten up.  I shouldn't have...  Didn't Richard Pryor rape you, too, you're saying?  Definitely.  He had his big dick.  He did, right?  He was great. 
[03:19:30]  I said, good, man.  Thank you.  I needed that.  Sometimes a woman needs to be raped.  Holy shit.  Cut that for a promo.  We finally agree on something.  Sometimes, you know, you're really, you're a little shy.  Well, he promised me cocaine.  Richard Pryor said, how would you like to snort some cocaine with Miles Davis?  So I said, sure.  So he takes me to this hotel room and opens the door.  All there is is a bed, a nightstand.  And so I said, hey, hey, Richard, where's the cocaine? 
[03:20:00]  Where's Miles?  He said, there ain't no cocaine.  There ain't no Miles.  I want to eat your pussy.  True story.  I can't see anybody saying that.  Did he give a good head?  No, he just like, I said, I said, Richard, you're a real dick.  I said, I'm out of here.  You're a liar.  So I walked out.  He grabbed me, put me down on the bed, took his dick out.  He just, you know, like, picked my dress up, pulled down my legs, pantyhose, and fuck me.  Legs.  Legs, pantyhose. 
[03:20:30]  And he had a big dick.  With two Gs.  That's what I remember, man.  So that was Richard Pryor.  Yeah.  What happened when it was over?  Did you say, oh, my God, what did you do?  I kind of blanked out after that.  Yeah, but.  Yeah, I kind of just like, fuck, you know, I don't remember after that.  It's funny.  After the rapes, you just forget about it.  Rapes.  How many times have you been raped?  A lot of times.  Yeah?  About seven.  Seven times.  Yeah.  On the 10th one, you get a free one.  Maybe three I forgot about. 
[03:21:00]  Wow.  Wow.  You know, you live a wild life.  Sometimes you take a lot of, like, hitchhiking and doing stuff like that.  You hitchhike.  Because you don't have the money, you know.  So you got raped hitchhiking once?  Yeah.  And what happened there?  A truck driver.  What happened there?  He's, you know, he stopped, you know, he said, how would you like to smoke some?  And I said, I didn't want to smoke anything.  You know, I was on my way to California.  So from New York to California.  What, so the gold rush?  It was a covered wagon, not a truck. 
[03:21:30]  She was a Klondike.  But no, so he seemed like a really nice guy, you know.  And then he said, let's smoke some, a joint.  So I smoked a little joint with him.  And then he said, smoke this joint now.  Ah, Segway.  Right, Segway.  He's a good writer, that guy.  No, he pulled over to a truck stop, took his dick out.  He said, all right, you know, suck on this.  I go, no.  I go, no.  He said, you better, man.  So, you know, I was going to charge him.  I was going to charge him money. 
[03:22:00]  Well, taking lemons and making lemonade, were you?  Yeah.  But I was going to charge him.  And I said, okay, give me money for it and I'll do it.  So, and then I did it.  And then we had to climb in the back of the truck, of the, yeah, of the truck.  Uh-huh.  Because there's a little bed there, you know.  Yeah.  And his socks stunk.  I remember that.  Ooh.  And I just remember, whoa.  And it was a real quickie and I forgot.  Oh, he fucked me.  Right.  And then I said, okay, where's the money? 
[03:22:30]  He said, forget about it.  Then we had breakfast in Ohio and I hitchhiked back.  This is a hell of a rape.  I said, no, yeah.  He's a nice guy, like, you know.  It's a skin flint.  It was like, he was a nice guy.  Well, what could I do?  What are you doing?  I mean, I was like walking hitchhiking.  I said, fuck.  He was a nice guy.  He fucked you and didn't pay you and then dropped you off in Ohio.  And then bought me breakfast.  Hey, got a breakfast.  Hey, bought a breakfast.  And got another ride home.  I said, and there was a guy, I said, oh, I was like scared to go.  I said, let me go back to New York.  Fuck California. 
[03:23:00]  And a really nice guy picked me up and he just drove me home, bought me candy.  Did you have sex with him at all?  No.  Oh.  I just assumed any time you're alone with a guy, they're having sex with you.  No, there are hookers at truck stop.  That's not a rape, Sandy.  You said that was a rape.  It was.  That's not a rape.  Yeah, that wasn't a rape.  I didn't want to fuck off.  I don't want to fuck off.  You were prostituting yourself and then he didn't pay you.  No, no.  He said, come on, I want to fuck you.  I want to fuck.  I go, no, no, no.  Then I finally said, okay, if you pay me. 
[03:23:30]  It was a truck stop in the middle of the night, man.  What am I going to do?  You know?  And at least he didn't.  This is a bad business decision.  Yeah.  That's like investing in the company you guys invested.  Yeah, Citadel.  I'm just saying.  I mean, what are you going to do?  He didn't pay me, bought me breakfast.  He started off at $19 a share and you ended up at $144.  $144 with breakfast and a sore bed.  You know, I need negotiators here, man.  At least he bought you breakfast.  That's nice.  He bought me breakfast.  I said, let me get the fuck home.  I don't want to even go to L.A. now, so. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  Free car fare.  All right.  Can we bring in some of these other women?  It's after 10 and I would love to have some of these fucking girls.  Yeah, we're going to break and do the cherry darts thing.  So Sandy, Kane, thanks.  But I'm in the contest, right?  Yes, you are.  Yes.  I think there's a cherry stuck in your anus right now, though.  Yeah, it looks that way.  In your anus.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Snap up the cherries like a toad.  JBL.  We got JBL here.  The thing that picks up the golf balls at the range.  You can stay or leave.  It's up to you.  I think I'm interested now. 
[03:24:30]  All right.  All right.  There's a lot of young babes out there.  Going to the circus.  I like that.  All right.  So we got JBL from the WWE.  The big plug for the boner juice there, JBL.  MamaJuanEnergy.com.  All right.  Thank you very much.  And our own Pat Duffy's on it.  He's feeling a lot of energy.  Yeah.  A lot.  Are you feeling any tingling down there?  Do you feel like you could get a boner if you had the rights?  If my chick was here, it would be.  In a second?  Oh, stop.  You pussy whipped fucking dick.  You're a dick woman.  You're a pussy whip. 
[03:25:00]  Hold on.  We're going to call you out on that.  Get your chick over here.  She can leave the other joint for a half hour.  All right.  Get her over here.  We'll bring her in here and we'll see how fast it takes.  Can I have two plugs because I'm working?  Let me plug Russell first.  Okay.  No, no.  Let me plug Russell first.  And then we'll plug the truck stop you're going to be fucking at.  Russell Peters live at MSG Wamuu Theater Friday, February 21st at 8 o'clock.  No, no.  This Friday.  Oh, it's this Friday?  Yeah, February 1st.  Like tomorrow.  Who wrote this up?  Sam.  Sam.  Oh, this Friday and Saturday. 
[03:25:30]  Okay, because he was only off by 20 days.  That's good.  Okay.  Thank you, Russell.  This Friday, February 1st at 8 o'clock.  This is his second show.  The first one is sold out.  So MSG Wamuu Theater this Friday, February 1st.  And go to Ticketmaster.com or his website is RussellPeters.com.  By the way, we have no idea if Santa Cain's rape stories are true.  No, of course not.  No, she just says them.  I personally think she's insane and doesn't know the definition of rape. 
[03:26:00]  Well, I'll rape you, so rape me, I'll help you.  But I have two jobs.  So Sugar Land tomorrow night, Daniel Narduccio's party at Sugar Land in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  What the hell is Sugar Land?  I'm in Cleveland, I'm in Cleveland, and they call me Cleveland, Ohio, called.  Steamers.  And they've booked me, man, because they heard my song Tits My Party, where I wanted to play for you.  It's really funny.  Tits My Party, and I'm going to be there March 7th and 8th for their first anniversary party. 
[03:26:30]  It's called Now That's Class.  It's a great club, and the guy's name is Paul Schlachter.  Why would you plug the owner's name?  Because he's a big fan of XM and Opie and Anthony.  Okay, that's good, but that's not going to help you sell tickets.  You're not a good plugger.  No, I'm not.  Hey, Russell's working at the MSG Wamuu Theater with the great manager, Fred, who's normally not there on Tuesdays due to family obligations.  But yeah, he was the one that called and gave me the money. 
[03:27:00]  That's wonderful, so now you've got to fuck him, too.  Okay, I can't wait to get raped by him.  All right, more with JBL.  We've got Russell Peters.  We've got Cherry Darts.  We have girls.  We're going to have Naked Girls next.  Yes, we are.  For lots of money.  Who's the sponsor of Cherry Darts?  It's right here.  Bodog.  Bodog, okay.  All right, good old Bodog, man.  Bodoglife.net slash poker has given us $2,500 to give away to the contestants today.  I was going to say to the winner, but that's not true because we're going to give first, second, and third and all that. 
[03:27:30]  Whatever.  Bodoglife.net slash poker.  We'll continue.  Every knee must bend, every head must bow, every tongue must confess, thou art the greatest, the greatest of all time.  Ella, Ella, A, A.  Yeah, we suck.  Kofi and Anthony, y'all.  All it takes is naked women to get people to come down to this station. 
[03:28:00]  Wow.  I'm seeing faces I haven't seen in months.  They don't come by when we're talking politics.  This is fucking lovely.  Yeah, we got Naked Girls in the studio.  We're just about naked.  They get their bra and panties on and all shapes and sizes.  Very nice.  Across the board.  A fine ass over there.  Very nice, yes.  Some of these girls we've seen naked before.  Holy mackerel.  Jesus Christ. 
[03:28:30]  Yeah, I was just saying, that is some ass.  How about we get a mic on them?  Yes, sir.  Tony, you're standing there with them.  On the ass.  Hey, Anthony's admiring your ass.  What's your name, honey girl?  Jen.  Where are you from?  Long Island.  Cool.  How old a girl are you?  Plenty.  Welcome.  Thank you.  Kiboki.  20.  That's pretty good.  And then we got the sisters.  Oh, sisters.  There's sisters over there.  Oh, my God.  I was on before.  Yes.  The American Girl.  Yep.  The girl, she's... 
[03:29:00]  My little sister, Aurora.  She was with the Brazilian girl.  I think she fell asleep on the couch.  Yeah, she took a nap.  That's always good.  How old are you both?  22, 18.  Wowie.  Fucking naughty sisters.  God, that's fantastic.  Right.  And then their stupid fucking boyfriends are here.  Well, they have to be, then.  Who else is going to throw cherries at their eyes?  I don't know.  I think you can find some volunteers.  This is the only second time I've met my sister's boyfriend.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, this is a whole weird experience as it is. 
[03:29:30]  You got to bring your dirty boyfriends.  Your stupid things with dicks.  It's our idea.  Who are the boyfriends?  Who are the boyfriends?  Right there.  So you guys, who's dating who?  I got the one with the ass.  I got the one with the ass?  I got the barely legal one.  You're barely legal.  You're the one with the ass.  Cool.  And then I'm the one over there.  The one who's been here before.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm the one over there. 
[03:30:00]  Wait, which one is yours?  Amanda.  Akron girl.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess we're both Akron girls, but.  Yeah, and then.  Do the sisters make out or anything?  We can only hope.  Yeah, and then he's the barely legal.  And then, of course, the ass.  And then there's the ass.  And then, of course, we have Red Rum, our old favorite.  Who's just a fucking trooper.  How do you not love Red Rum?  Of course.  I don't think she wants to be called the old favorite.  Not old favorite, but old isn't it.  I'm just sticking up for Red Rum.  Because I'm older than both all of them, so.  No, it's not an age old, you know. 
[03:30:30]  Red Rum's body bounced back after the kid.  It's got to be acknowledged.  It certainly did.  So, dude, where'd you find Ass Girl?  I found her in Jersey.  In Jersey?  Yeah.  And then, like, what happened?  You take her home.  What happened when you saw that ass?  Lost your fucking mind or what?  Actually, it's a funny story.  She's actually one of my best friend's sisters.  Oh, boy.  Awkward.  That's always good.  She wanted a massage.  Yeah.  She wanted a massage?  Yeah.  How the fuck did that happen?  I got lucky. 
[03:31:00]  You certainly did.  Yeah.  Very lucky.  All right.  Does your best friend know that you brought her here to show her anus to us?  Yes.  Yeah.  We've been together for two and a half years, so.  All right.  That's good.  That's all right.  So you're basically allowed to show it to whoever you want.  Yeah.  I had a best friend that banged my sister, too.  Three men.  His name, by the way, Adam Ferrara.  Yes.  Where did Adam go?  That's true.  Hey, really fast, because she's got to get back to work.  We got Pat Duffy's girlfriend in here, and Pat's on the juice.  Pat took some of JBL's boner juice, the MamaJuanaEnergy.com product. 
[03:31:30]  And Pat, why don't you explain to her what happened?  Because she always comes in here confused, like, why am I here?  What did he do now?  Don't worry, you don't have to taste shit in his mouth this time.  Right.  Not this time.  Basically, I drank some of this energy drink that's supposed to give you a boner, and they  wanted her to rub on me, and I didn't want to do that, because I knew you'd be mad at  me, and that's disgusting.  So.  Wow.  Right.  Sandy Kane.  Brought you over. 
[03:32:00]  So basically, what he's saying, I got to translate.  Sorry.  If the girl was a little hotter, he would have said yes.  Exactly.  Not at all.  Wait, rephrase that.  At least you know he'll never cheat on you with an ugly chick.  Okay.  He has standards.  Pat, you got a boner now?  No.  Not yet.  And Mike the cop touched it before, and that even softened it further.  Did Mike poke it?  He did.  Mike poked at it to see if this juice works?  Yes.  Good boy.  Gives the all, let's see if you're stealing, poke. 
[03:32:30]  Creepy cop.  Really?  Is that a concealed weapon I need to check?  Take the clothes off, because she's wearing a peacoat and stuff?  She's not taking her clothes off.  I don't have to.  No, but I'm just saying a little bit.  I mean, the peacoat is not the most tantalizing peacoat thing.  But she's not here for her sexiness.  This is the part.  She's not here for her sexiness.  Well, I don't think so.  Not with that coat on.  So, Pat, can we get something done here?  Basically, what we're trying to do, we want to see if this juice works.  So we're just seeing if maybe you could, I don't know, just do anything to see how quick  it would just pop. 
[03:33:00]  There's no way anything's going to happen in front of everybody.  There's just no way.  How about if you face the wall?  It won't say anything.  Just close your eyes.  See?  No one's here now.  See?  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  What if she just kind of, like, touched it?  Maybe.  Nothing.  This is so awkward.  It's not everybody.  Why?  We know you guys are dating.  Oh, yeah.  That's so good.  They believe you're in a truck.  Yeah.  Just punch him in it.  There's nothing. 
[03:33:30]  I'm sorry.  There's nothing.  Yeah, but no one's going to buy JBL's drink.  You've got to get a boner.  No, I'm sure if under any other circumstances there wasn't a million people staring at us,  it would be good to go.  Anything, though?  No, except for hate for you.  Why me, though?  Why hate me?  See?  I'm really tantalizing, but he can't even get it up in front of his own girlfriend.  Oh!  Wow.  You know what I'm just saying, that, man?  Oh, snap.  What kind of stuff are you doing?  What is this stuff?  Viagra?  Go, you can say it every fuck you want. 
[03:34:00]  Viagra and Prune Juice.  He doesn't know if he's coming or going.  I like that.  Never pre-planned.  He mixed Viagra with Prune Juice.  Where's Richard Pryor when we need him?  I know.  Off the cuff.  In case Jimmy wants to use it on his next show.  Food!  All right.  So, Pat, do you have anything to say?  I was going to say with Pat's girl.  Pat's girl doesn't play games.  She doesn't like this.  What?  I'm just saying, you don't play games.  You don't like the fact that she's saying that type of stuff?  You should beat her up. 
[03:34:30]  She was very badly raped.  Why don't you take a little something off, though?  I'm just saying, you're a very beautiful woman, but with a sexy coat, it's not too tantalizing  for your boyfriend.  She has a little something called class.  Uh-huh.  Ah.  I got a nice ass.  No, you don't.  You kind of have a boy's ass.  Yeah, you really do.  She's a little heavy around the thighs, though.  Look.  Jesus, Sandy.  It's the right for people to say, I'm ugly, but I'm just telling the truth.  I didn't say anything to you, though.  No, you didn't.  Did I?  So then why are you making shots at me? 
[03:35:00]  No, but your boyfriend did.  Your boyfriend did.  That's a different person, isn't it?  Yeah.  No, but I'm not saying it to you.  I'm saying it to them.  Good one.  He told me to say, shut up, stupid cunt.  I'm just speaking the truth.  I'm just speaking the truth.  Uh-oh, now all of a sudden, I just ignore it.  What?  Ignore it.  Ignore it, right?  You're like 80 years old.  Do you really want me to say something to you?  Oh, yeah, go ahead.  Everyone's saying it anyway, so I'm trying.  I don't ignore it, but, you know, I got to say, you know, if you can't have the best 
[03:35:30]  of everything, I just do the best with everything I got.  Which means getting raped seven times.  I wish there was an eighth, man, you know?  But the best rapes ever.  Oh, shit.  Rape's bordering on lust.  God.  I'm just saying that, you know, the truth is the truth, though.  No one's perfect, but, you know.  Perfect.  Perfect.  You have a thumb growing out of your vagina. 
[03:36:00]  Perfect?  That is true.  No one is perfect.  I'm just saying, you could take your, you must have like a fat complex if you're not  taking your coat off.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  No, you didn't.  No, she didn't.  That's not true, though.  Feel free to just be honest about, you know, Sandy in whatever way you want.  It's going to take too long.  I've got to go back to work.  She's a sexy girl.  She came over.  She is beautiful.  So did I.  Hold on a second.  You're always here.  We work with her at CBS, so she doesn't want to just come over and take off her coat 
[03:36:30]  in front of her naked girls because we work together on a different professional.  It's just a different situation.  And we know her from work.  You can't even take your coat off.  Well, she doesn't want to.  I have a job.  She's going back to work.  What is your job?  I'm going to be in Ohio in March 7th and 8th and I'm going to be at Sugar Land tomorrow  doing a party and lighting my tits on fire.  It's part of the Sandy Cain rape tour.  Yeah, you know, that's what I do.  I fucking light my tits up for money.  That's the job I have.  Awesome.  No retaliation needed. 
[03:37:00]  All right?  All right, well.  I light my fucking tits up.  It's more fun than I bet you have.  Why are you going after her?  She didn't do shit to you.  I don't know.  Wow.  It is kind of fun.  You're mad because we're beating you up, but we should beat you up.  You're horrific.  Why are you going after her?  She's a nice girl.  No, she went after me.  No, she didn't.  No, she didn't.  We all did.  No, all I said was she has fat thighs.  She has nice thighs.  If it wasn't Pat's girlfriend, I would be very, very lusting towards her.  She has very feminine, sexy thighs.  No disrespect, Pat.  I'm sorry.  Okay, I don't want...  That's what I happen to want to hit on you. 
[03:37:30]  Okay.  That's absolutely fine.  I'm offensive, but...  Pat should be hard at this point because this is pretty good.  That's a rock.  Are you wanting to talk or what?  No.  All right.  Can we move on then?  Yes.  Thank you.  Coming.  Sorry.  That's the radio.  All right.  Let Pat go talk to his girl.  Yeah, that's a long elevator ride.  Sorry I called you in. 
[03:38:00]  It was disgusting, though.  I mean, is it?  He did say it was disgusting.  That was God who said that.  God didn't say it.  He just broke it.  No, but he said it was disgusting.  I mean, it's like, well, why can't people take it when they give it?  Because you were...  Well, I'll say this and play devil's advocate.  Because you were kind of hitting...  She just walked in.  She was actually being nice.  She wasn't going to badmouth you.  So you should have probably kept it on him because you were starting shit with her.  She's looking at her boyfriend in front of a bunch of naked chicks, half-naked girls,  and you're just attacking her.  She didn't fucking do anything.  But it's Opie and Anthony and XM Satellite Radio. 
[03:38:30]  You have to expect...  What's wrong with gorgeous naked women?  Nothing.  You know, the body is the most beautiful temple there is.  And if you don't keep a good body...  What would you do to yours?  Yeah, exactly.  That's your problem.  I mean, I exercise every fucking day.  Sandy Kane, do you like all the bodies in the room?  All the women you're with?  Well, I mean, I love...  You know, you want...  Hey, some people, you know, I mean, they overeat.  They eat too much.  I mean, I like to sub-dick myself. 
[03:39:00]  I mean, that's me.  I mean, everyone has to reach their own, you know?  I like to sub-dick and swallow cum.  That's me.  Sandy, go around the room and just give one line on each girl that's going to be participating in cherry darts.  All right, go down the line.  Okay.  There's all shapes.  There's all sizes.  This girl is very beautiful.  It's very thin.  Beautiful.  You want her to turn around?  Turn around.  Let's see.  Nice, cute ass.  Holy mackerel.  Bend over.  Let's see.  Come on.  Be proud of your ass. 
[03:39:30]  She showed it to you.  She showed it.  Okay.  All right.  No, I'm just saying.  Is there any problems with her?  I'm not a lesbian, but this girl's beautiful.  Is there any problems with her, though?  Red rum is the first girl she was talking about.  Well, she could have implants.  I mean, let's face it.  No, I'm just saying there's a lot.  This girl has beautiful tits.  Look.  Sandy, one of the time.  This is radio.  One of the time.  That woman has big, big fucking tits.  You said you wanted honesty, so okay.  Yeah, okay.  No, I'm just saying.  You generally think she's beautiful, but she needs implants.  Yeah, okay.  I need, you know, implants are great today. 
[03:40:00]  Stop.  Don't worry.  Okay, that's just it.  A lot of beautiful implants today.  All right.  Okay, a lot of beautiful implants.  Okay.  Sorry.  All right.  So that's red rum, and you're saying that she's beautiful, but she needs implants.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  The next girl.  It's the next girl.  What's your name?  Jen.  Jen.  Very beautiful girl.  Turn around.  Please?  Oh, shit.  This is a pretty perfect body.  Pretty perfect, but I mean, today, in today's market, she could even use implants, too. 
[03:40:30]  Are you out of your fucking mind?  No, I'm just saying, like, tits like her, if she had implants, they'd be really nice.  Let me say.  Go over here.  Those are fucking perfect.  You're insane.  You're in Sandy.  How big are your boobs?  Me.  They're full Bs.  Yeah.  They fit the size of her body.  Every other person's implants today.  Yeah, she's got a lot of B.  If they were bigger, they'd be like...  That's insanity.  No, but weird.  If she had implants, her tits would really be nice.  They're nice now.  You don't want to be bigger. 
[03:41:00]  Man love big fucking tits.  That's fucking true.  Go ask all those guys.  Not true.  No way.  Men love big fucking tits.  You know what?  I bet she's staring at this on her and not that.  All right.  Exactly.  Men love tits.  All right.  Move down the line, Sandy Kane.  A little honesty.  Hey, you know, tits are great.  You know, I love tits.  All right.  Thank God.  What's your name?  Okay.  Me?  Yeah, just for the radio audience.  Amanda, right?  Yeah.  She was in the middle floor.  And Sandy?  She, I think she could be standing a little sexier.  I think she has a nice body, but, you know, it's like how you stand, too. 
[03:41:30]  But she's very, very nice.  I mean, I don't...  You know, this is like kind of hard for some girls to come on here and get naked, and you're  just making it even worse.  You just leave.  We're trying to have fun here.  Okay.  And be naked.  That is true.  You're trying to be naked in the fucking Crypt Keeper.  Yeah.  I have notes on your creep show.  Like, I have my own self-body issues.  You don't need to point them out and, you know...  Well, at least it's...  Don't worry about her pointing them out.  Believe me.  No, but at least you're talking and you're giving your point of view, which is really great. 
[03:42:00]  And I appreciate you just even, you know, just showing some personality besides your  fucking body.  All right.  You know?  And I like the...  Did that hurt to get, like, that ring in there?  No.  No, it didn't.  Let's just...  Turn around.  Let's see.  There's black and blue marks over there?  I have some bruises.  S&M?  Uh-huh.  No.  Beats me.  Who?  Your boy can beat you up?  No.  Okay. 
[03:42:30]  No.  Hold on.  Amanda, you really have body issues?  No.  I mean...  Why?  What?  Everyone.  Okay, I'm here getting naked.  That's what I'm getting at.  I don't have, you know...  You've got a beautiful body.  I have some minimum...  But you've got a beautiful body.  Thank you.  But you don't like your ankles?  Yeah, really.  You don't like the back of your knees?  Yeah, but look at your back of your knees.  She has black and blue marks.  All right, Sandy.  I'm going to a vet clinic.  You think I don't get beat up at the vet clinic by dogs?  Oh.  Try it, Sandy.  It's right, buddy.  It's happening again right now.  Well, I am not that level, okay? 
[03:43:00]  I would never let a man hit me.  Cocker Spaniel.  I can't help it.  You know, like Sylvester Stallone's bodyguards.  All right.  They beat me up.  Okay.  All right, move on.  The beautiful sister?  Yeah, this is...  Isn't she beautiful?  Sandy's just jealous of women that need tampons.  She's a really pretty girl.  If I was a lesbian, I would eat out with her.  What's her name?  Where would you go?  I'm Aurora.  Hi, Aurora.  How you doing?  Where would you go?  Who said that?  I'm fucking funny.  I would eat that with her.  I would eat you if I was a lesbian. 
[03:43:30]  I love dick.  She's the 18-year-old one, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, the sister.  The 18, uh-huh.  Any issues, Sandy King?  Well, I think that...  I need boob implants.  Yeah, the boob.  Yeah, okay.  But otherwise, no, you'd be great with big tits, but you still...  You and your big tits.  Not every guy likes big tits.  It's not true.  It's all rolled up in there.  Not every guy likes big tits.  You're crazy.  You're a crazy woman.  I don't like fake tits, Sandy.  Look at yours.  They're fucking...  They're nice.  Oh, jeez.  Those were sagging when any one of these girls were born. 
[03:44:00]  They have tassels on them.  Those aren't tassels.  Those are her nipples.  Russell Peters.  No, I have big tits, but I have no nipples.  That's great.  All right.  God let me out.  Wow.  Anything else with this one?  Looks like they came off of the curtains at the Tangiers.  It's hard, spot, and great.  You pull one of those in.  What stagecoach did you get those from?  They do look like those things that they put on the horse's heads in Central Park.  You're like my nudity, my friend.  Somewhere there's a mess.  I agree.  I have a small tits. 
[03:44:30]  I probably wouldn't have done that.  All right.  Next.  Okay, wait.  I have a question then.  Yeah.  For all the men who love big tits, do you like these big tits?  No.  No.  Not at all.  I'm not a big tit fan, to be honest.  First of all, I'm not a big tit fan.  I like beans.  I don't like big tits.  Yeah, I grew up.  Well, I love small dick, so.  No, I'm not talking about little fucking.  About men who have no money and have small dick.  Because you've never seen one fucking hard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Every woman likes big tits.  That's why they call me implants.  You just think because you have big tits that guys, all guys like big tits. 
[03:45:00]  There's so many fucking implants today.  But strippers, because the guys that go there.  Not strippers.  In my aerobics class, every other woman has fucking implants.  What are you, the step?  What are you?  The step?  The step.  The step.  The step.  The step.  Kickboxing.  Dickboxing.  No, they have food.  And they're doing incredible jobs.  All right.  Move on, Sandy.  We've got to fucking wrap this up.  That is the biggest plastic surgery.  Move on.  Move on.  Now, this beautiful woman here.  She has big tits.  I'm Chris.  Hi, Chris.  Hi, Chris.  Hi, guys.  What's the problem there, Sandy?  She has huge. 
[03:45:30]  What size are your titties?  Actually, they're a D and a half at this point.  They were a double D.  What?  Do you have breast reduction?  No, I've just been exercising.  Oh, okay.  Great.  For the show?  No.  For me.  Right.  Okay, great.  That's great.  So, are you going to go topless?  Yeah.  Okay.  I've taken off my topless.  Hey, fucking decent.  I've taken off my topless.  There were 80 jokes to do that.  Sandy Kane, nothing else?  You like the big...  Go topless with me, Chris.  I'll wait until everybody else does.  Yeah, you like the big tits there? 
[03:46:00]  Anything else there, Sandy Kane?  Well, about the ass.  Well, we'll be good.  It's about everything.  Oh, we're going topless.  Yeah, we're going topless, too.  Okay, great.  Okay, I was a first.  I'm not afraid to take my top off.  You're not afraid?  Nice.  Good girl.  Whip it out.  Whip it out.  Whip it out.  Okay.  Yeah, really.  Okay.  Yeah, you're done, Mike.  I'm just the judge.  Okay, this girl here?  She's going to be the...  The judge?  Mary.  Wow.  She has nice snipples, look.  Hey, I can't see.  Look at her snipples.  Wow.  Yeah.  Hey, stalker Patty's other fucking...  Stalker Patty. 
[03:46:30]  She looks like a...  Oh, thanks.  Wow.  Patty's kind of cute.  In the dark.  Oh.  There's the pie on the kettle black.  Yeah, what?  Ah, nice.  There you go.  So what's the issue there, Sandy Kane?  Well, I know.  I'm on public access television as a sex symbol  for 13 years.  And I get, like, all these...  Sex symbols.  That masturbate to me every Friday night.  It's sex with a fucking red line to it?  Yeah, the symbol for what?  No, I'm just saying.  They masturbate to me. 
[03:47:00]  I have, like, guys call me hot on the phone, like,  Sandy, you're so beautiful.  What?  So, I mean...  Anything?  Any other issues with the...  Okay, this girl.  She's good, right?  Oh, she has...  Oh, no.  Oh, issues.  I really didn't get down to your ways  because, you know, I mean...  Okay.  It's the radio.  Okay, no.  Yeah, I know you're...  But you keep exercising, though.  Of course.  Because it's really good.  The exercise is the best thing you've ever heard.  Well, gee, thank you very much, Jacqueline.  She's a real motivational speaker, isn't she?  She's a regular... 
[03:47:30]  Dick Simmons.  Dick sucker.  Ah, we did.  Okay.  I suck hot.  Okay.  Now, this girl, Mary.  She's an animal.  Mary's on a here.  You know, you could also use some exercise.  You have great tits.  I mean, your nipples are nice.  And what size tits are you?  46.  40C.  Very good.  40C?  Let's turn around.  Why don't you both turn around together?  So uncomfortable.  All right, Sandy.  She has a nice ass crack. 
[03:48:00]  Nice ass crack.  Yes.  That's nice.  You can walk in the glutes.  Yeah, I can walk in the glutes.  Okay.  You can walk in the asshole?  I've been walking in everything, yeah.  Okay, very nice.  Look at her.  Look at how she can do that.  Very good.  Ah, look.  She can move her cheeks.  Great.  Well, you bend over.  Just once.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Nice crack.  Dolphin cotton.  That was a crack.  No, very nice.  What about this girl?  Okay.  Remind me.  I need Michelin tires when I get out of here. 
[03:48:30]  Okay.  It could be, like, a little bit briefer.  But, you know, the body's nice, but it's also how you hold it.  You know?  Okay, but very nice, but you could keep exercising, okay?  You're better than Patty.  You're better than Patty.  All right.  Well, it's time for cherry darts.  That was cool.  Like a pot chicks and a stack of pancakes.  We'll explain how uncomfortable that was tomorrow.  $2,500 provided by bodoglife.net slash poker. 
[03:49:00]  When you want to play poker like a professional, you go to bodoglife.net slash poker.  JBL, having fun still?  Absolutely.  Right.  Was that a little?  That was a bit awkward, huh?  A little awkward, having Sandy Cain critiquing people.  Yeah, Sandy Cain's a minus one, and she's critiquing other women.  Now, what are the rules with, uh, we have to give the rules real quick.  Dan's got the rules.  These guys have figured it out behind the scenes.  Let's see.  Okay.  We're just going to, because I think putting on the bullseyes with whipped cream will take forever. 
[03:49:30]  So we're going to, each, uh, couple gets a throw per round, and the person with the  farthest throw, you know, farthest from the asshole, um, eliminated per round.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, where, so the girls have to, if they, if they, if they, should the girls disrobe  now?  Do we have to move this along?  Yes.  Absolutely.  We're going to get you facing the wall, hands down, on couch.  Um, yes.  Sandy, is it going to be a lineup?  Yeah, we should.  Yeah.  All right.  And that's how you executive produce.  Thank you, Steve. 
[03:50:00]  Yes.  Yeah, but let's get, uh, these girls starting over here.  Oh, my God.  Should each girl have a, like, these girls start there?  Jesus Christ.  These girls start there, so they're not facing the other way.  Should each girl have a circle on their ass?  They don't, they'll just tie.  Well, we don't have to do a whole, like, dartboard, but one circle?  No?  What?  Okay.  You girls.  Over here.  How about, Dan, three shots per, per couple, right?  Yes.  And then the one that's not, and the one that's the furthest is eliminated.  Okay.  Yeah.  If that'll happen fast enough.  All right, the girls are getting naked and topless because they need to be topless for 
[03:50:30]  cherry darts.  And we have to have the sisters next to each other.  I think that's mandatory.  Yeah, and they should be touching each other and fondling each other.  Yes.  Two sisters, red rum ass, and those four, I'm thinking selfishly from my own view.  Two sisters, one cherry.  There you go.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  All right, we got some.  Fuck.  Jimmy, comment?  Oh, wow.  Yeah, I'm very happy.  We have, like, a lineup.  Excuse me while I adjust.  Sam, if that fucking hair gets in the way. 
[03:51:00]  Holy mackerel.  We have a lineup.  We rarely get such a lovely view in this studio.  A bunch of, uh, we have the two sisters.  We have red rum.  Steve, get the fuck out of the way.  Steve, out of the fucking way.  We have, uh, we have the beautiful ass.  We have, uh, the girl, uh, number one, who's Sandy made uncomfortable.  And girl number two, who's Sandy made uncomfortable.  Jesus Christ.  And then Sandy and Danny.  Boy.  That is...  Really, um...  Something. 
[03:51:30]  I know.  Okay, so...  Are you girls embarrassed?  Don't be embarrassed.  No.  Everybody all right?  You can...  Anyone have anything they want to say to Sandy Keane after the critiquing?  I mean, please.  She needs to get the fuck out.  Oh.  So we can have some fun.  Yeah.  I'm with you.  All right.  Danny, get the fuck out of the way.  All right.  Are we ready for this, or what?  I'm kidding.  You can stay there.  I'll find another camera.  Should we call Amanda's partner, please, to the throwing line? 
[03:52:00]  All right.  And have they practiced?  All right.  I'm, uh, Kyle.  Where's Kyle?  I'm looking behind me.  They all brought their, uh, boyfriends, by the way, and wives, and...  Look, do I need to put on this?  Oh, there's Kyle.  Okay.  Well, you've got to dip it nice.  So you want to have it at least leave a mark, if possible.  Oh, this is going to leave a real big mark.  All right.  And then there's a tape line on the, uh...  Yes.  All right.  And we're, uh...  Edge of, uh...  Each one gets three shots, okay? 
[03:52:30]  And then we eliminate after that.  The closest of the three shots.  How far am I, like...  Three shots.  Just like this?  Yes.  Yeah, yeah.  Now you turn...  You have to get on your hands and knees and kind of...  And kind of open up your asshole.  Yeah.  It's going to be lodged right in there.  All right.  Closer.  Oh, we need the bullseye.  No, you're never going to get it in there.  It's her ass crack closed.  How does she go?  No one's telling them anything.  Are people just shouting this?  And can someone mic the thrower?  Wait, like this?  Thank you.  Oh, I need to be like this? 
[03:53:00]  Why are we micing the asshole?  Mic your mouth.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Two mics.  Shut up.  Two mics, shut up.  Why doesn't someone show me the position?  I need you to spread those cheeks.  How about you just go like this?  All right, here you go.  That's what you need to do.  How fucking hard is this to figure out?  Get on the couch and spread open your asshole.  Holy fuck.  Oh, God.  Wait.  All right.  You can't see her ain't this.  All right.  Spread the cheeks, baby.  I am. 
[03:53:30]  A little bit more.  Holy mackerel.  Can you angle the ass up a little bit more?  I need a little bit more.  Perfect.  Is everyone happy with this throw?  Yes.  Throw.  Am I throwing from here?  Where does he stand?  The line's up there, right?  No, that's not good.  That's too close.  Yeah, that's way too close.  They got cheek on that one.  All right.  So, 0 for 1.  All right.  It hit the lower...  No, you got to stay this, because he's getting 3.  It hit the lower left cheek so far.  Yes.  Looking for...  Looking for asshole.  Holy fuck.  So happy. 
[03:54:00]  Oh, that's a lot closer.  Not bad.  Just off to the right.  About an inch.  Inch and a half.  All right.  This is for the glory hole.  And here we go.  The last throw.  A little close.  Not bad.  He hit ass cheek.  Not a bad job.  All right.  Steve.  Steve's got the...  What a shock.  Steve.  Steve names himself fucking tape measure guy.  It's good to be...  Now, go ahead.  Did you want to do that?  Of course I did.  Well, the ladies...  The ladies asked for a gay guy to measure, so... 
[03:54:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  Be precise.  I can...  Inch and a half.  Inch and a half?  Watch yourself there.  You know, you're getting a little...  What if one of these girls has an ass cave?  That wouldn't be too fair for everybody involved.  Well, it's...  You know, it's like an athlete having more muscles than another athlete.  He's got his little pad.  Steve.  Two inches.  Two inches?  Two inches from ground zero.  Wow.  All right.  All right.  All right.  The next girl.  And now the sister.  That's fantastic.  Was the sister, Jimmy?  Right here.  Oh, she's lovely.  Yes. 
[03:55:00]  The 18-year-old sister.  Young with her whole life ahead of her.  What a lovely girl.  And her boyfriend has a Johnny Cash t-shirt on.  Certainly does.  And the base is the eight different bands.  You got this.  You have to bend over more so we have to show you a butthole.  Don't tell me what to do, bitch.  You're never going to get it in there.  Oh, wow.  What's the fucking...  That was almost nothing but that.  That was a knuckleball.  That thing dropped.  Yeah, come on.  I so don't want this to ever be on the internet. 
[03:55:30]  Nice shot.  You got one more.  Come on, baby.  All right.  No political career.  There we go.  There we go.  All right.  Now.  Jesus.  High.  Fucking spine shot.  All right.  The top of the crack.  Let's go measure.  I measure.  It's okay.  I'm not even interested.  Yes.  Sam noticed that there's something funny on Steve's tape measure.  What's on Steve's tape measure, Sam? 
[03:56:00]  Probably a five with a big black thing.  Three's fucking...  Wow.  Wow.  How close?  Three inches from ground zero.  Okay.  All right.  Three inches.  Red rum and her husband?  It says Ms. Fix-It on Steve's tape measure.  All right.  Red rum's going to show everyone how this is done, by the way.  That's how he's doing it.  See, that's how it's done.  There's a target.  See?  It's too bad JBL has left the show because he would have loved this.  Where's JBL?  Staying there.  I don't know. 
[03:56:30]  He's gone, Jimmy.  Look at her fucking hiding.  I think it has something to do with Fox or something.  Wow.  That was a horrible toss.  If you don't get this, you're dead.  Yeah.  I'll say.  Oh!  Wow!  Wow!  Oh, my God!  Our first bullseye.  That was a bullseye.  Wow.  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  You see, you have to make the anus accessible.  Yeah.  That was a bullseye.  See, this is shit. 
[03:57:00]  Do we have to measure this?  No.  Well, Steve measured just to...  It's a bullseye.  You don't measure that.  It's a bullseye.  That's an official bullseye?  Well, no, she should take another shot.  Yeah, yeah.  Just in case you get another bullseye.  You got to do the third one because if, let's say someone else gets a bullseye.  You never know.  Steve got two bullseyes.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Brian.  And you know it tastes like whipped cream?  All right.  Hold on.  All right.  Okay, so we have a bullseye.  All right.  Not bad.  Not bad.  Very good.  Not bad at all.  Fucking red rum. 
[03:57:30]  Try the hoop du jour.  Jimmy, who's up next?  Ass is up next.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Go all the way over now, madam.  Hold on.  Yeah.  Move over.  Just make this one take as long as possible.  Yes.  That's right.  Push your hiney out.  We're not even looking.  Are you allowed to?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You can do as ever you want.  You're allowed to have a log fallout if you want.  Oh, come on.  I step into it a little bit.  Hold on, Jimmy.  What just happened?  We got a southpaw.  He hit the wall. 
[03:58:00]  Fucking Bob Dole just threw one.  He missed by easily a foot and a half.  Yeah.  It hit the wall behind her.  Mom, lob it.  She's...  Oh, my God.  It just hit a right shoulder blade.  What's wrong with you?  Wow.  Have you ever fucked her?  We did this after a minute.  And she's making the target nice and big.  Oh, my God.  That's a great target.  Oh, my God.  And...  All right.  A little closer.  You got to measure that one. 
[03:58:30]  And, Steve, please cheat.  I don't think we should have stayed.  Yeah, Steve, make sure you cheat on this one, Steve.  Take a while.  What?  JBL's...  What?  What happened?  I just...  What?  Two inches.  Two inches.  Two inches.  Two inches.  All right.  We're losing JBL from the WWE.  Oh.  JBL, so the big plug for the boner juice.  MomandJuanaEnergy.com.  Appreciate you guys having me on.  I really...  Oh, no problem.  Who are you?  Big fan of you guys.  I'm in the garden at Waboo Theater this week. 
[03:59:00]  Oh, okay.  Hey, thanks for coming in, man.  I'm big fan of you guys.  Thank you very much for having me on.  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  Thank you.  All right.  JBL, everybody.  Thanks, guys, for the WWE.  Tell everybody...  Tell everybody what you witnessed here.  So they, too, shall come.  Thanks, sir.  Thank you, buddy.  I'm good for meeting you.  We'll be in touch.  Absolutely.  All right.  Hey, there you go.  That's a...  You're a good man.  Stand out of the way.  Glasses?  See you, buddy. 
[03:59:30]  Good luck seeing you, man.  Thanks.  Hey.  Give me the camera.  Thank you.  You doing good, brother?  Yeah.  Take care.  Nice.  All right.  JBL walking around saying goodbye.  There you go.  Oh, come on.  I'm standing here with my ass up in the air.  I know.  As a contestant has her ass up in the air.  Jeez.  Right.  And no one noticed.  All right.  Are you guys having fun?  Hold the phone.  Yes.  No, hold the phone.  There we go.  Are we ready?  Why is there a lot...  What's going on here?  Jimmy.  You're the play-by-play guy. 
[04:00:00]  Okay.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm Stan Speedy.  I don't remember your name.  Chris.  Chris.  All right.  We got Chris.  Okay.  Chris is a big girl.  She's a big bottom.  And she is showing it.  And she is fucking...  She's looking ready for sex.  And her husband is...  Wow.  Just a friend.  Just a friend?  Just a friend.  Okay.  So friends are four.  All right.  He kind of looks like Chris Christopherson, and yet he looks nothing like him.  And he is going to attempt to throw.  Like Chris is a fucking bottom.  And if you miss this...  Come on. 
[04:00:30]  It's working on.  Oh.  He's getting there.  He's very close.  All right.  A little observation.  So you can hit the broadside of the bar.  No enthusiasm by the thrower.  What's that about?  Normally, that would be a close shot.  Yeah.  No enthusiasm here.  Let's see the enthusiasm.  Boom.  Boom.  Come on.  And finally, the third one coming in.  Right in.  Now you've got to surround it.  Go ahead.  Oh, that was close, sir. 
[04:01:00]  That takes a measurement.  That was close, sir.  Steve a little slower with the tape measure.  Well, yeah.  They don't.  I got it.  I just...  What do you have Parkinson's?  Why are you shaking?  Yeah.  Just got to apologize for the boyfriend.  Because who isn't just staring?  They got to just stare.  Two inches.  All right.  So you're still in the running.  That's ridiculous.  We've got three girls tied right now.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Here we go.  All right.  Who's up?  Mary.  Hi, Mary. 
[04:01:30]  Hello.  Good to see you again.  Cool.  And who is her slight friend?  Is this her boyfriend?  Yes.  How are you, sir?  Your pants are a little high.  They certainly are.  He's a lot older than he looks.  Yes.  What?  Wait, we did it yesterday.  Yes, sir.  Wait, you guys were practicing?  Yeah.  That's funny.  Could I ask a favor?  Yeah.  Could you two switch places, please?  Thanks.  Why?  Oh.  It's all like...  Anyone wants to stare at an ass there.  All right.  Let's, uh...  You've got to be kidding me.  Can I say the boyfriend is fucking dressed for a pedophile conviction? 
[04:02:00]  You need to come back a little bit, sir.  All right.  Sir, you have to come back a little bit.  You fucking...  Yeah, I'm about there.  Your hush puppies are right by our crack.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  The target is revealed.  There you go.  She's peeling it open.  He's kind of close.  Not bad.  Kind of close.  Oh, she's fucking holding one half open.  The other half's relaxed.  Well, he's a righty.  Oh.  He's leaning in.  That asshole's winking. 
[04:02:30]  All right.  You just hit a wrist.  You moved over.  You got to move to the left a little.  And you guys practice, huh?  Stop panicking.  Jesus.  You're going to hold of yourself.  And finally, this is the last shot.  Oh, she's stuck.  Oh, there you go.  There she goes.  That's fucking angry asshole.  You can't get it in there.  That's wonderful.  There's a target.  Oh, close shot.  Close shot.  Close shot.  All right.  Don't move, Steve.  Very close.  Steve.  Yes.  Why haven't we heard from Steve as he measures? 
[04:03:00]  You have been.  Yes.  What do you think, Steve?  Because he keeps looking below.  Whenever he sees the vagina, he goes, oh, darn.  That thing again.  Yes, exactly.  Thank you, Jimmy.  I don't even know why I'm here.  That is one inch away from ground zero.  One inch?  All right.  One inch.  All right.  And that's it.  That's it for the contestants.  Oh, no.  We got Sandy Kane.  Who's throwing for her?  Hey, there's already two chairs in there.  I hope Roger Clemens.  Is my hammer right at? 
[04:03:30]  Hold on.  We got to throw her.  Oh, Jesus.  It hurts.  I just don't want to hurt my hemorrhoid.  Is that in?  She goes, is that in?  Is it in?  Oh, Jesus.  What's being thrown here?  Is that in?  Can you use a watermelon for that one?  Her hand.  All right.  Another.  She's got blueberry yogurt all over her ass. 
[04:04:00]  Again.  Anyone?  Oh, darn it.  Did anyone describe that?  Was he really trying?  Because you've got to give her a shot.  Go ahead.  Yeah, yeah.  I'll throw for you.  I don't care.  You want to throw?  No, you've got to give her a shot at the money.  It's a lot of money to stick, man.  Oh.  There you go.  Oh, that's it?  Is that in there and measure.  Steve, get closer.  I don't want to get close.  Steve, it's in the rules.  Oh, my God. 
[04:04:30]  That's disgusting.  Steve, what's disgusting about it?  Oh, that looks like chopped meat.  It is, unfortunately, about an inch and a half away from ground zero.  You know what?  Use a cherry and preparation H and see what happens.  Yeah.  Now use anisosuppository stuff.  All right.  All right.  So who's out?  Yeah, who's out?  After the first round.  After the first round, the furthest away was Aurora with three inches.  Who's Aurora?  Aurora.  The 18-year-old. 
[04:05:00]  Thanks a lot.  I think we need to give her a second chance.  God fucking damn this.  Oh, well.  Well, what are you going to do?  And tied for, well, actually, Red Rum had a bullseye.  Mary was one inch away from ground zero.  Sandy Kane, one and a half inches.  And Amanda, Jen, and Chris are tied with two inches each.  All right.  Well, you just washed the slate clean, though, right?  You're fucking the 18-year-old's gone.  Good.  Who wants to look at that?  Yo, naked body.  Thank God that was eliminated early.  Thank God Sandy Kane's still in the competition.  Oh, I was hoping she'd still be in the room. 
[04:05:30]  All right, at least we got something to look at.  Yes, we do.  Should we cut it down to two throws, maybe?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Now we do two throws.  Amanda, you went first, right?  Good luck, Amanda.  Now, Amanda, you've seen the techniques that work now.  Yes.  I will.  Don't be shy, Amanda.  This is second half adjustment.  By the way, I just want to acknowledge that we got $2,500 up for grabs here.  Bode on wipe.net slash poker.  So you might want to try a little harder.  Do it for God and for country, Amanda.  That's right.  All right.  All right.  Good luck, son. 
[04:06:00]  Come on, Kyle.  Kyle, throw it.  Yeah, cheer him on.  Wow, he just hit Amanda's finger.  Yeah.  Yeah, two.  Barely hit him.  Okay.  Oh!  Wow.  Oh.  That means to measure it.  Yeah.  Danny?  Where did it hit?  That grazed the actual asshole.  Yeah, it was a graze.  A glancing wound.  That was a fucking...  That was a fucking...  What's that?  Bend over this one.  Yeah, you did.  There it is.  All right.  They found it. 
[04:06:30]  They found it on the lip.  They found it on the lip.  Jesus.  They found it.  Okay.  Yes, behind the grassy knoll.  All right.  Damn it.  Well...  What a good job you have right now.  Well, if you're actually measuring towards ground zero, it's about three inches.  Really?  Yeah.  She has...  Some girls have less space between the asshole and the vagina.  That's the way it works.  All right.  Yeah.  He hit her on the top of the lip and...  Yeah.  He grazed the clit.  All right.  Well, let's just see.  It was a good shot and yet a bad shot.  Steve, the clit's not back there, by the way.  Yeah. 
[04:07:00]  It's tough to graze the clit when they're bending backwards.  I know what I'm talking about, really.  Red ramen or a husband fucking Mr. Aim.  Wow, wait.  What a target.  Now, that's how you spread it out there, ladies.  Yeah, you go.  Even if you miss, we all win.  Oh.  Uh-oh.  I love how annoyed she gets.  God damn you.  Yeah, she's not happy.  And...  Close enough.  No, a roll doesn't count, yeah.  Impact point.  Point of first impact.  It's so funny to listen to them, because instead of like, you didn't cut the grass, 
[04:07:30]  she's like, ugh, you missed my asshole.  Yeah, that's much closer.  All right.  What do we got?  That is two inches, two and a half inches from ground zero.  Okay.  Ooh.  All right.  She's going to move on.  Red ramen moves on to the next round.  Yeah, she does.  You got to be what?  Three inches?  Is that what we're...  Right?  Okay.  Yeah, three is the highest so far.  And this is...  Son, you're doing this for all of us.  Great ass.  Great ass is up.  Round two.  Open it up, you goose. 
[04:08:00]  Holy mackerel.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  That was like top crack.  Yeah.  And here comes the last throw.  Ah.  Oh, boy.  Same spot.  Same spot.  The southpaw is having some problems.  He is, but it's understandable.  Do you need a pinch hitter?  We're going to go to the bullpen.  We need a new boyfriend.  And Steve.  That is two inches from ground zero.  All right.  So she's going to move on.  Still in the running. 
[04:08:30]  Okay.  And now Chris is up with her friend.  Should I spread it this time?  Yes, it might help.  You want to show that asshole young lady.  How's that?  Oh.  Damn it.  Sorry, buddy.  Damn it.  Don't be sorry.  It's good.  You got to mess with a butthole.  Wow.  And Mr. Aime.  Fucks us up.  Well, you would too.  Good boy.  I mean.  One more shot.  Right by that.  Oh, he hit the finger.  Damn.  I felt like I had to pay a toll. 
[04:09:00]  Steve, get in there.  One more embarrassing.  She's going to have to spread it again because I have to measure from how it was.  There you go.  Spread it again.  Rolls and rolls, right, Steve?  Get your fucking sticky tipped fucking...  Look at the E-Rocs taking good pictures.  Three quarters.  Lucky us.  She's going to be in the next round.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  And is this... 
[04:09:30]  Mary.  Mary.  Mary.  What are you doing last time?  Yes.  That is a meaty taco.  All right.  Wow.  That is one meaty taco.  That's a catcher's mitt.  Okay.  Fucking missed.  It's like an upside down exclamation point.  It's a semicolon.  Close.  All right.  Steve, get in there.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to measure.  I can't stop doing him.  I know.  Steve. 
[04:10:00]  I live for it.  Steve hates having any interaction with the listeners.  Oh, gee.  Is it that obvious?  Three and a half inches from ground zero.  Oh, no.  We might lose her.  Here's your hat.  What's your hurry?  All right.  All right.  Okay, good.  Sandy Yuck is up now.  Yes.  And the fucking...  Oh, well, she's now...  Fucking asshole.  Looks like an orangutan asshole.  Oh.  I can't even look at his body.  What'd he hit?  He hit New Jersey. 
[04:10:30]  He hit New Jersey.  He hit New Jersey.  He hit New Jersey.  He hit New Jersey.  He hit New Jersey.  Anything?  Steve, get in there.  Measure.  Measure.  We got rules, you know.  This is so disgusting.  Can I measure with a sexton?  I love my ass, so don't do...  That's one.  Four inches from ground zero.  Oh, that's too bad.  We might lose her.  Oh, man.  It's sad.  Oh, well.  It looks like the bottle of cherries.  I think we might have lost Santa Cain. 
[04:11:00]  Steve, the official measurements?  Who gets knocked out?  Sandy's out.  Sandy's out this round.  Oh, Sandy Cain.  Let's hear it for Sandy Cain.  We're down to...  Five girls.  One, two, three, four, five.  Who was the one that threw?  No.  Wow.  Yeah.  Oh.  We counted Sandy as a girl.  Oh, okay.  Five girls left.  Let's do it.  All right.  Amanda.  You doing two?  Hey.  Yeah, we got you two.  Yeah, stick to two.  Yeah, stick to two.  I want to see if that ass is open.  How about we...  How about we... 
[04:11:30]  Should we eliminate two girls this round?  No, no.  You want to eliminate two girls?  Let's see how it goes.  Yeah, let's see how it goes.  All right.  Let's see where we end up with this thing.  Okay.  Oh, hey.  Wow.  I don't think there's another throw necessary.  There is, though, Kyle.  Yeah, you got to get two because if someone else's bullseyes, you need...  Wow.  It's very close.  If not a bullseye.  Yeah, it's close.  You're right.  It's a good one.  Two good shots.  That one's up high. 
[04:12:00]  Wait, does he have to measure that?  That one a little high.  We should call this one a bullseye, I think.  Okay.  Really?  Yeah, it's a bullseye.  All right, a bullseye.  That guarantees the next round.  Red rum's up.  Getting better.  Don't slip.  Don't slip.  All right.  Must have fell on Sam's thumb.  Red rum is...  You've penetrated your uterus.  You got a big thumb.  Red rum knows...  Red rum knows how to play catcher.  Back of the neck is... 
[04:12:30]  Oh, Joe, you're on the way of the camera.  Yeah, there you go.  And...  Oh!  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Red rum's in trouble.  Oh, boy.  Top of the ass there.  On the right side.  Three inches from ground...  Oh, no.  That could be a problem.  Mm-hmm.  Red rum is not happy.  She is pissed.  All right, we got the southpaw, though.  This guy is very unpredictable.  With his throwing style. 
[04:13:00]  Wait.  She wasn't even ready.  Slow down.  Hey.  Well, let her get it ready for you, then.  She's walking out to the mound like a catcher.  Yeah, let's slow it down.  Calm him down.  Yeah, slow down.  Let her prime that thing for you.  He's nervous.  There you go.  Oh, Jesus.  You know, you're ruining it for all of us.  Oh, boy.  Damn.  How close was that? 
[04:13:30]  Not even close, Steve?  Yeah, that was way over four inches from...  Yeah, we're going to lose the ass.  Yeah, she got back up to the table.  Ugh.  There we go.  There you go.  Amazing effect, you're still in it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well...  Oh.  Hey, can you have a little more enthusiasm thrower, please?  Yeah.  Come on, fella.  And, uh...  There's the second shot.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, well.  Look like bird droppings.  Which one? 
[04:14:00]  You could close your ass.  Put one up on top.  Leave your butthole open.  Five inches.  Oh, wait.  Ass may still be in the game.  Ass may still be in the game.  I think the thrower took one for the team right there.  No, the thrower didn't even know.  I think he might have taken one for the team.  Okay.  And is this the final contestant?  My favorite part is that she has her socks on.  Right.  Okay.  She's classy, all right.  All right.  That's a pretty good throw right there. 
[04:14:30]  And the guy with the big pants pulled up very high is the thrower.  All right.  You got to throw some pictures out there for everybody.  Oh!  And he fell short.  Bounces in front of the mound.  Careful.  Steve?  That is...  Steve's measuring assholes.  He certainly is.  How was work, dear?  Steve?  Three and a half inches.  You just don't want to be close to that asshole, do you? 
[04:15:00]  All right.  Very good.  Is that it for that round?  Yeah.  All right.  Steve, who's out?  Out this round, the two highest were Chris and Jen with the ass.  Which one was higher?  Chris was higher.  Oh.  I thought Amanda was higher.  Get rid of one?  Yeah, I think we should get rid of one.  All right.  So Chris is out this round.  So we're down to...  We're down to four.  Four.  Amanda's up.  All right.  We're back to Amanda. 
[04:15:30]  She's assuming the position.  Holy Toledo.  Jimmy, Russell Peters, anything?  Good times here in the front row.  Wow, his fucking boyfriend's got some aim.  Yeah, this guy's the real deal.  He says he doesn't want to work the rest of the month.  He needs money.  This kid doesn't play games.  Unless he's playing asshole cherry games.  Wow.  All right.  He's very close.  Fireball.  Two good shots.  Steve?  That is...  Get an accurate one, too.  I am. 
[04:16:00]  That's an inch and a half from Grim.  Oh, look at that.  That's good.  Yeah.  Nice.  Why is my agent calling me while I'm on the radio?  Because they're crazy?  Because they're dumb.  All right.  Red Rum.  Look at the target, Jimmy.  Oh, look at that.  Hold on.  Okay.  Hey.  All right.  That's very close.  Just off to the right, probably...  I'm going to guess under an inch on that last one.  Both row.  Red Rum, assuming the position.  We're taking pictures.  I don't know where the fuck...  Wow.  Wow.  That almost went...  That almost disappeared, that one. 
[04:16:30]  What do we got, Steve?  That is...  Focus.  Wow.  That's an inch and a half as well.  Wow.  Seemed closer.  All right.  Very good.  Nothing.  I'm sure there's a mic, the asshole joking.  Oh, we're losing a microphone.  What happened?  I think it's mine.  There's a battery going on somebody's mic.  One of the wires.  Can you turn that off?  I can hear that. 
[04:17:00]  Where's my headphones dying?  Your headphones there.  Dying.  All right.  There you go.  There we go.  All right.  We're back to the south, Paul.  Oh, yeah.  And the ass.  God, I wish I...  Oh, what are you doing?  And he hit her leg.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Hold on.  Hold on.  What's wrong with this guy?  Think before the shot.  Take a breath, you motherfucker.  Jesus Christ.  Get some more whipped cream on it.  We're never going to know when you hit it.  Oh, fuck.  And the second shot. 
[04:17:30]  Oh, my God.  Okay.  I think he deserves another throw.  I think so, too.  The first one was just so way off.  Oh, my God.  Use the ass, Luke.  They're not allowing it.  You can't do it.  You can't.  Believe it or not, we got official rules.  Official rules.  We could actually get in trouble if we don't follow the rules.  How ridiculous is that?  Sorry.  If it was up to me, the whole jar of cherries would be thrown at your ass.  One by one.  We would have started at six in the morning. 
[04:18:00]  What was that, nine feet?  Yeah.  The guy is just awful.  Geez, how'd you miss that?  Michael J. Fox would have thrown better.  All right, what do we got?  We got Sox McGillicuddy up next.  Sox McGillicuddy.  Why the red ass?  Sox McGillicuddy, a big player back in the 70s.  Trying to make a comeback here.  Oh, very.  Why can't you be throwing for the other guy?  Yeah, really. 
[04:18:30]  Just above ground zero.  Very close.  Nice shot.  Got a little finesse on that one.  Put a little English on it.  He did.  He did put a little English on it.  That's going to be the first one.  Steve, get in there.  Get a good one.  Yeah, I am.  It is just about one and a quarter inch.  All right.  They got a good technique right there, that couple.  She opens up nice and wide, gives them a big target.  Big target, big target. 
[04:19:00]  They've worked together for years, socks and high pants.  Yeah, we lose Jen on that one.  But I don't think Jen should get dressed just right away.  Just in case.  Sort of like a cheerleader.  Take a lap for the fans.  I wouldn't get dressed just in case someone pulls a hammy or something.  We might get you right back in there.  You never know, you know.  All right, we're back to Amanda.  Right?  Yes. 
[04:19:30]  Oh, wide open like Red Run.  That's the way you go, ladies.  Starting to recognize the girls by their assholes.  Yes.  This is true.  Do you mean their boyfriends?  What are we down to?  Three girls?  Oh!  Right in there.  Wow, what a shot.  Another bullseye looks like.  This guy's on fire.  This kid does not fuck around.  Bring in the heat.  Oh!  And he hit the lower lip.  That guy is on target.  On target.  If you want, I'll step in and measure this one.  All right, that's a guarantee they're moving on. 
[04:20:00]  Red Rum's husband is wrapping up fucking bounds.  Sweetheart, I would use the soft wet wipes if I were you.  Red Rum is...  Considering the delicate area of where it is.  Yeah.  I just don't want you chafing.  A little bounce.  A little bounce.  You've got to get a little closer than that.  Well, we'll see.  Probably about two, two and a half inches.  Second shot.  Oh!  Wow!  Destroyed it.  Oh!  Destroyed it.  I saw the point of impact, and that was not a bullseye.  Oh, it was a little low, right?  It was a little off, yeah. 
[04:20:30]  She still moves over, though.  It was just to the right of the asshole.  She still moves on.  She's still a fine throw.  Holy shit.  He's in the running for the side bundle ward.  How close, Steve?  Half inch away.  Half inch away, I'd say.  Is that it?  And then we have...  Oh, we have one more, right?  One more.  No.  Mary.  Mary.  Mary, the forgotten contestant.  The Sox.  Sox.  Yes, that's me.  The White Sox.  Sox McGillicott?  Sox McGillicott.  That's me.  That's funny. 
[04:21:00]  All right, and she's...  Holy shit.  She's giving her man a huge target.  And her man, Pedro Hypante.  Sorry, I've got to go to work after this.  Okay.  All right, he's got a second shot.  Look, you're not at work now, you douchebag.  Second shot.  Oh, jeez.  What do you learn?  Not even.  Oh, lower, lower.  I hate to see you leave.  What do you do for work?  Stagehand.  Stagehand?  Stagehand.  What production?  She's done.  Anything that goes out, I'm actually going to be working at Soul Shop. 
[04:21:30]  Okay.  All right.  So we lose...  We lose Mary.  We lose Mary in our socks.  We lose Mary in our socks.  Amanda and Redrum.  Amanda and Redrum.  All right.  Still two throws?  Marvel?  Or should we do sudden death?  I'd say you give a...  Try oranges.  Okay.  It should be closest.  Yeah, let's do...  You know, this is the finals three shots, and that's it.  And then we'll get a winner.  Three shots?  Yeah.  Yes.  And then all the guys get to jerk off. 
[04:22:00]  As long as the plastic's down.  All right, Amanda's...  Oh!  Wow!  This guy knows how to hit ass.  Right?  Oh, man.  He's a champ.  This guy knows...  This guy has thrown cherries and anuses before.  Um, we've been practicing all week.  Really?  Wow!  He is not a rookie.  Your living room's a mess.  Sam, that hand...  That's good.  Oh!  Wow!  Amazing!  Look at this.  Give me the money.  Just give me the money.  Do you want to measure that one just for...  Posterity?  Well, in case we want one bullseye.  Posterity.  All right, they...  What do you guys think? 
[04:22:30]  No, it wasn't two bullseye.  No.  One bullseye?  And measure the second one.  Tony, what do you think?  What do you got, Tony?  One bull and about a half an inch to three quarters of an inch on the second one.  All right.  Well, measure the second one.  You got to get a measurement.  Hold on.  Why?  It's just the closest one.  No, but if this guy has a bullseye, he might have to go to the second one.  That's like, what?  Three quarters of an inch?  Yeah, it's about three quarters.  Three quarters.  Well, I think if they both do bullseyes, then we just have to do the final round again,  right?  Two bullseyes will win it.  Oh, I see what you're doing. 
[04:23:00]  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Red rum is giving him the...  If you get two bullseyes, I'll give you a head on the way home.  Wow.  Wow.  If he doesn't, then he'll give it to me.  All right.  She...  All right.  If you get two bullseyes, I'll give you a head on the way home.  Oh, no.  Oh.  He's panicking.  Hit before the plate.  One more.  No pressure.  The final one.  Red rum bent way over.  Oh.  Oh.  He's fucking blattered.  He had a bad last rum.  Damn. 
[04:23:30]  She's going to bite your dick up on the way home.  Bad last.  Oh, boy.  What happened?  Oh, no.  Amanda and Kyle.  Thank you.  It is Amanda and Kyle.  One of the sisters actually wound up winning the whole thing.  Very good.  $2,500.  Well, no.  Yes.  What do we got?  No.  We got $25 total.  We got $25 total.  Oh, total.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because what do you guys decide?  First, second, third, or first and second?  What do you guys do?  That would require preparation.  How about...  Double it up.  How about two grand to the winner and five to the second place? 
[04:24:00]  Sounds good.  Because that's easily determined.  Plus all the cherries you can eat.  Yes.  That's actually really good because I would have done it even...  Worse than that.  Okay.  Seriously.  I would have gave the top three money, but...  How about everyone?  How about everyone?  What about at least $100 for everyone that did it?  Why?  All right.  Go ahead.  Cough it up.  Like she coughs it up.  Practice.  And I'd like to thank first and foremost the fact there is no God, so I am the winner. 
[04:24:30]  Okay.  That's...  No, that was comfortable.  Practice that in the shower for a while.  Very nice.  The ladies did great.  Wow.  So they got $2,000.  Huh?  One of the sisters wins two grand.  Yeah, look at that.  Red rum wins 500 and we all win.  Bodoglife.net slash poker.  They certainly did.  Bodoglife.net slash poker.

It's this Friday, February 1st, 8 p.m.  This is his second show.  The first one is sold out.  Ticketmaster, or you can go to RussellPeters.com.  And, of course, it was great having you, Russell.  And I thank you for having me on such a wonderful...  Yes. 
[04:25:30]  It was a great day.  You had a great first appearance to be on.  The fucking two little assholes looking at you.  I'm going to only have Yoshi calling me after.  Hey, I heard you on radio.  Good job.  Yeah.  Hey, One, we did a great job.  Jim Norton, say hi.  Yoshi's just a fucking pornography filthy little...  You know what's funny?  I called Jim one time when I was in Florida.  I was playing one club.  He was playing another club.  And I pretended I was Yoshi.  He was doing an arena.  I was doing a club.  No, I was playing club.  And I pretended to be Yoshi.  And he thought I was Yoshi. 
[04:26:00]  Hey, Jim's Yoshi.  Where are you?  He really sounds like that fucking creep.  Yeah, we all know Yoshi.  All right.  And Adam, of course, governor is on Long Island tomorrow and Saturday.  Yeah, tomorrow and Saturday.  And the movie definitely may be opening Valentine's Day.  Very nice.  Oh, wonderful.  Ladies, any final thoughts?  Anybody have anything?  Everybody cool?  I have a rod.  Everyone's good?  Red Rom, you all right?  But second place?  Not really.  He's still good. 
[04:26:30]  What a day for sport.  Yeah, certainly was.  Certainly was.  Spanning the ass.  Yes, what a spectacle.  To bring you the constant variety of sport.  All right, why don't we do line of the day and get out of here then if everyone's cool?  Steve, everyone cool?  Everyone's cool.  SkiColoradoNow.com gives us line of the day.  For info on great deals at 26 world-class resorts, up to the minute snow conditions, log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  I can't believe my relationship ended. 
[04:27:00]  Yeah, that sucks to me.  Like, while this was happening.  While it was happening, huh?  Yeah.  Now nothing will stand in your way.  Here's a runner-up line of the day.  No, we should do.  We should drink this juice and then get Sandy Kane naked and see who pops the boner first.  Why?  Hey, hey.  Just fuck it.  Does it make you blind?  Yeah, that was a good one.  We'll move right on to the next runner-up line of the day. 
[04:27:30]  What do you think, Gorgeous?  I think before electricity, you were probably hot.  JBL.  Right to the next one.  Those were sagging when any one of these girls were born.  They have tassels on them.  Those aren't tassels.  Those are her nipples.  Russell Peters.  You got to come back when we do a regular show.  This was one of those weird days.  Hey, I'm really upset with your weird days, to be honest with you.  We just wanted to squeeze you in. 
[04:28:00]  We knew we had a crazy day.  He had some funny shit.  Oh, yeah.  He had some very funny ones.  Definitely want to have you back on.  Yes, most definitely.  The final.  Pat Duffy, everything cool with the chick?  We need an update.  It got a little awkward.  I apologize.  If I could, on behalf of myself and my girlfriend, I hope Sandy Kane gets raped and murdered.  You're halfway there.  Yeah.  It was a problem after she left?  Yeah, totally uncalled for.  Was she all right, though?  Yeah, she's pissed, and I'm pissed about it. 
[04:28:30]  I'll say that I'm not going to defend Sandy.  But she probably looks like it doesn't matter, because she gets beat up so bad when she comes  in that she's just...  I'm not even saying that she was right, because it shouldn't have happened.  But I think that was our error, having a nice girl come in here, even though our intentions  weren't to be shit.  That was probably a mistake we made.  Yeah.  So our apologies to your chick, who we like very much.  We all love her.  You know that.  How fast did this show go by today?  It did zip by.  My God.  Bonus show and everything.  That's right.  Oh, one more runner-up? 
[04:29:00]  Yeah.  Another runner-up line of the day.  If a girl has to be fucked to reproduce, she has to look at both of us and make a decision.  That's the end of Norton's as we know it.  Fucking finished.  Fucking finished.  And finally, thank you, skicoloradonow.com.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes the line of the day.  Line of the day. 
[04:29:30]  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  He's, you know, he stopped, you know, he said, how would you like to smoke some?  And I said, I didn't want to smoke anything.  You know, I was on my way to California.  So from New York to California.  What, so the gold rush?  F-U-A-B-U!  We ain't two takes in, you mother hunkers!  All right, look.  All right, look.  There's a lot of talented guys in the studio today, do you? 
[04:30:00]  We have to end the show with that today.  That one will always make me laugh.  Very nice.  And there you have it.  I guess that's it, right?  Ron and Fez up next at noon.  Thanks, guys.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Bye.  Later, man.  Bye.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Dude, let's go!  Just hilarious.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Really funny.  If I could use the word, I would.  Not that word.  Really awful, too, by the way.  I'll acknowledge that.  But, uh, I lost my thought.  I'm sorry.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show. </pre>
