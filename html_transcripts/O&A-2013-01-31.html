<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with Greg graphically detailing a severe bout of acid reflux and its consequences, using explicit language. This transitioned into a discussion of a recent storm, the humorous nature of people tweeting about storm damage, and complaints about insurance companies.  Greg then discussed a letter from AFTRA regarding an insurance refund, leading to a conversation about unions and his experiences with them.

A significant portion focused on the movie *Lincoln*,  including a humorous anecdote about a delayed promotional copy. This segued into a discussion about *Animal House*, specifically Bruce McGill's career success versus John Belushi's smaller role and the unexplained inclusion of Belushi in seemingly extraneous scenes. The death of Patty Andrews was mentioned, prompting the playing of "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" and subsequent sexually explicit commentary on the Andrews Sisters.

Greg shared a personal anecdote about a conflict with a deceased aunt, leading to a discussion about family relationships, contrasting Greg's difficult experiences with Anthony's generally positive family relationships. This was followed by a discussion about old photos from Greg's early radio career, featuring explicit language and references to a former girlfriend and colleagues.  The segment concluded with highly offensive commentary about Wayne LaPierre and the NRA, their stances on gun control, and the emotional impact of events like Sandy Hook.

The following segment heavily featured gun control, focusing on the NRA and using highly offensive language to describe an unnamed spokesperson and the organization.  A comparison was made between deaths from assault rifles and drunk driving.  The conversation then shifted to Ron Jeremy's aneurysm, including a graphic recounting of a multi-person sexual encounter at the Venetian, referencing a photo. Several news stories were covered: a radio show potentially facing termination for mocking a caller with Down syndrome; Artie Lange's controversial interview with a 49ers player about gay players (which appeared on Drudge Report); a botched on-the-spot interview in New Orleans; and the Opie and Anthony show's exclusion from Super Bowl Radio Row.  A YouTube personality who went viral with a threesome video was also discussed, along with further discussion of Artie Lange's Super Bowl activities and the homophobic remarks.  Technical difficulties with posting a picture online and discussions of Twitter accounts featuring nude or sexually suggestive content were also included, all while using highly offensive and vulgar language.

The next segment began with speculation about what Sway Calloway might be hiding under his hat at the Super Bowl, followed by a discussion of Lindsay Lohan's legal troubles.  A significant portion focused on a news report about a radio DJ, "Moe," who spoke to Kelly Baker, a woman with Down syndrome, criticizing the news report's framing of the interaction as bullying.  The hosts discussed their "O&A's one and done Gay Off" contest sponsored by Steven Singer Jewelers, Fez's upcoming wedding, Stalker Patty, and Ron Jeremy.  Further discussion of the news report, including a call from someone claiming to work at the station, alleging laughter at the woman with Down syndrome,  was followed by discussion of Senator Robert Menendez and a YouTube video about a planned threesome.  Listener calls were taken throughout.

A subsequent excerpt discussed the attraction between De Rosa and Bobby Kelly, leading to a humorous comparison to Roseanne Barr.  The conversation shifted to heterosexuality and oral sex, followed by an interview with Patrick Kennedy, a retired Milwaukee detective involved in Jeffrey Dahmer's arrest and interrogation.  Guests included Kennedy and James Thompson (documentary filmmaker). Kennedy detailed the arrest, interrogation, and his personal reflections on the case.  The interview concluded with promotional plugs for Kennedy's documentary and book.  The segment ended with humorous and offensive banter between Bobby Kelly and Who Kid, including jokes about Dahmer, race, and sexual acts, and mockery of Sal's abrupt ending of the main segment.

The final excerpt discussed upcoming live shows, specifically Bob Kelly's Access appearance, focusing on the potential consequences of success or failure. The conversation devolved into crude and offensive humor, including racial slurs, homophobic remarks, sexually explicit descriptions, and jokes about body image, sexual acts, and celebrity gossip (Rick Ross and 50 Cent).  Penis hygiene was a significant topic, with exaggerated and offensive jokes.  References were made to DJ Who Kid, Sam Roberts, and others.  A phone bit from a previous K-Rock show, featuring vulgar and offensive insults to prank callers, was replayed. The segment concluded with promotion of Bob Kelly's stand-up shows and Steven Singer Jewelers.

[00:08:00]  Oh it's hilarious  It's good  I'll be able to watch a half hour at a time  I just uh  I was watching it  And then I realized again  I go  Fucking D-Day from Animal House is in that  And I tweeted it  Really  And I'm like  I was like  You know what  Out of everyone in Animal House  That motherfucker  Has had the most lucrative fucking acting career  Now a lot of people might say Kevin Bacon  Kevin Bacon was in Animal House for like a second  I don't consider him one of the  One of the stars of the movie 
[00:08:30]  Uh he was in it a little bit more than a second  Kevin Bacon was  No he's like  He's like  Be calm  Be calm  All is well  And he gets run over  And then he's in the um  He's in like the  The scene in the frat house  Uh thank you sir  May I have another  Right  But he's not like one of the main characters  Like Niedermeyer and fucking  All them guys  Uh  And then  Um  Donald Sutherland  Other people have said  I was like yeah  Donald Sutherland is huge  But he was huge before Animal House  Sure  Like he was in a lot of fucking movies before Animal House

Walsh  Oh J.T. Walsh was great  He was in everything  He's one of those guys  Who you'll see in every movie 
[00:10:00]  Everything  And a lot of people  Probably won't know his name  He was the sheriff  In fucking  Um  Uh  My cousin Vinny  Mm  Uh  Right  Yeah that guy  Yeah yeah yeah  He just has been in  He was uh  On  I think he was on MacGyver  Also  Like he's just  Throughout the years  Every time he pops up  I go  Ah D-Day  Right  And he's  I've said that like a thousand times  I was off on his age  It looks like he's like 63  Holy fuck  He actually held up pretty good  Yeah  And then uh  What's his name  Uh

[00:23:00]  Everyone's great  But unfortunately  She had it out for me  For whatever reason  Gotta weed them fuckers right out  I don't know why but  Away with you  Away  I don't spend time with family  I was thinking the other day  As I was watching  Did you ever see the paper chase  With John Houseman?  A long time ago  John Houseman  John Houseman  Yeah he spoke for you  In a very unrealistic way  I didn't love the movie  It was a little boring  About Harvard Law School  But it was interesting  Just to see that world  And my uncle was a lawyer 
[00:23:30]  Went to Harvard years ago  He's dead now  But I just started thinking  About family  Like you get into that weird loop  I'm like god  I don't see my mother's side  Of the family at all  Right  My dad's side I talk to  I see my cousins  Yeah  Like I never fucking  Like I've just got my whole life  Without spending time with my family  They make money  The old fashioned way  Yeah  They earn it  Smith Barney  I started thinking about that too  They earn it  He was the guy?  Yeah  That was that guy  John Houseman  I haven't thought of it  John Houseman  You don't get together  For just a good holiday 
[00:24:00]  Christmas  Or I don't know  Thanksgiving  We used  I shouldn't spend my whole life  My whole life  That shit is fun man  Well they're in Boston  And my cousins  Were all the  They were just like  Fucking college  They were like  Legit geniuses  Like they would  You got geniuses in your family?  Yeah  Like fucking the Harvard  Brown people  The polar opposite of me  No not the kind  That you would hate  Well yes the kind  You would hate  Liberal  You would hate them twice  You're downplaying it though  You're a smart dude  No but I mean  They were like college  They were like college  How they related to you? 
[00:24:30]  My first cousins  So who's  My mother's sister's  Gotcha  Children  Yeah  So your mother's sister's  Children were fucking brilliant  Yeah like they were like  I forget what the schools were  One was brown  Wait what's this  There's another one  Yale was up there  You got your Harvard  Yeah the whole family  Was kind of caught up in  There was another school  Depending on  You got that MIT  No I'd know it if I heard it  If they went into like  Perfections I can't comprehend  Like religious studies  What the hell is that?  Do you have any  Geneseo people? 
[00:25:00]  I don't think so no  Hey man look it up  It's a great school now  Oh I'm riding the coattails  That Geneseo's a great school now  Yes I don't think  There was any Geneseo alumni  When I went there  It wasn't a great school  Come on  They used to brag about  Fucking mac and cheese parties  They used to brag about  Gag or Ty  They used to brag about  It'd be one of the  Biggest drinking schools  In the entire country  And now they're  One of the best schools  To go to  For the price and all that  It's hilarious  It's the same place 
[00:25:30]  Speaking of the  Mac and cheese party  You were here for  The Jim Chandler talk right?  Oh yes  Was I here for that  Or no?  So  You said you were  No you weren't  I didn't think so  We did a whole thing  He called in?  No  We did a whole thing on it  Because he posted a bunch  Of really old pictures  From back then  And one was the  Mac and cheese party  That Anthony's referencing  And I had a tie on  And then I had an old  Radio friend call me  That I haven't talked to  In 20 years  He called the show  To say he was the one  That took the picture  And then I go  Why was I wearing a tie? 
[00:26:00]  And he goes  Just every once in a while  You would put on a tie  I'm like what?  Because I hate ties now  Why would I do that?  You were crazy back then  A little thin tie  Gussied up  But I thought we had  Some kind of weird function  That we had to dress up for  And I still had the tie  And he goes  You're just a dork  I was a dork  He goes  You just every once in a while  Would put a tie on  To try to impress people  Everyone else at that table  Was just wearing  Like a regular shirt  I want to see this badly  So people reached out  To Jim Chandler  Saying man  You know  I hope he was talking  Nice about you 
[00:26:30]  He's the guy  Obviously if you're just  If you're not in  On this storyline  Me and him  Starring radio together  Literally at 18 years old  And he was the one  That we indirectly  Or you guys more than me  Trashed on Jacktober  I actually tapped out  And ever since  I've been trying  To get in his good graces  So he posts these pictures  On his website  We went through them all  Jimmy  And then Jim Chandler  He's like  Retweeting everyone  You know  And being really cool  So I 
[00:27:00]  I am the biggest  Fucking douche  So I go  You know what  This is my  This is my chance  So I DM him  Cause he is following me  He finally decided  To follow me  And I follow him  There it is  Reaching out  So I DM him  And I go  Building bridges  I go  Jim  All kidding aside  I would love  To catch up  Oh  He has not  Written me back  Oh  I blew you off  Blew you off  So I can't  I can't build this bridge  As much as that  Makes me happy  He may not  He may not have 
[00:27:30]  Seen his DM  Some people may not  Check DMs on Twitter  Oh boy  There it is  There's me  Oh my god  Have I seen this  Photo before  I don't know  I don't know  If you've seen this one  Do you subscribe  To douche monthly  Look at the fucking  Stupid jean jacket  What are they doing  Oh my god  The centerfold  From douche monthly  That was December  Through August  And I got a horrible 
[00:28:00]  Horrible old tie  Oh man  Had no money  So I don't even know  Where the tie came from  I probably borrowed it  From someone  And never gave it back  Oh man  But it's a mac and cheese  With like  I think it's ginger ale  Who's who  In the photo  I don't know any of them  Oh Jim's not one of the guys  Jim is the guy  Sorry I shouldn't say it  He's serving  He's serving  He's the only one  That I know  He's the only one  I know by name  I remember all  Their faces  I just don't remember  Their names anymore  They all worked  At the radio station  She's a horror show 
[00:28:30]  On your right  Yeah  Well look at the next one  Oh it just gets  Progressively worse  Yes  A little bit  We were saying  They make perfect radio holes  Right  Like if they're going  For radio  That's perfect  I bet you there were  A lot of jokes  Being thrown around  That room  That day  You can see  They're all in mid laugh  Everyone's laughing  I bet you just cracked  Like a really  Like a really mean joke  About the fat one  And she's trying to laugh  It off  I get it  Like you probably said  I'd fuck you  If we went pig  I'd go pig and  Point at her  And they all  Ah  We'd fuck a big pig too 
[00:29:00]  I finally put myself  Out there  I'm like  Alright  I'm going to build  A bridge for once  Yeah  He posts the pictures  He's being nice  To everyone  That was tweeting them  Saying yeah  You know  Just little nice  Little tweets  It's like alright  This is my fucking chance  Yeah  So I go  Jim  All kidding aside  I'd love to catch up  Nothing  The Rick Okasik tie  Is it thin  Well it's pretty thin  As opposed to thin  There's other pictures  Show them the other ones  I've seen that before though 
[00:29:30]  But then it's  Subscribed to  Douche Money  What a terrible magazine  But then it's  It's creepy  Because he's got  Like a picture  Of my car  Where's the ex  That  There she is  Spin that around  That's my ex  That's the one  By the way  That's who I went out  With when I was  19  19 and 20  She was  18 and 19  Wow  The one in the  Fucking  In the baby jumper  Yes  The baby  The one in the onesie  The onesie  That's what it's called  Shut up  I should have known  But do you know  Who she is 
[00:30:00]  Jimmy  Oh my god  Don't do this  Don't tell me  Is that hand out the window  Yes  Oh wow  Fucking nice  Whole stink box  That's great  She's like a hot Leno  I would assume  If she took care  Of that years ago  Better hope so  She's now in her 40s  Oh man  That broad's now  In her 40s  Jiminy Craig  Did she eat her ass  Oh Jesus  The hope store  Was just starting  To get into all that stuff  You didn't put  Your face down there  I don't think  I don't think 
[00:30:30]  That's where duty  Comes out  I'm not going there  I don't think  I ate any ass  In college  The hope store  Was just getting started  Just getting started  Jim  Just rolling out  I was a late bloomer  Because I  I was very small  In high school  So the girls  Pretty much left me alone  And then I  Made up for the lost time  In college  What year was that  Like 83 you think  84 maybe  Yeah  Well that was 90  What  Oh you said 80  No yeah  94  Of course  There's my car supposedly  I don't remember that car  I do remember 
[00:31:00]  I used to drive Hondas  So I guess it's my car  But I remember my car  Being a different color  That's the same  Fucking car  That Bruce Willis  Smashed up  In Pulp Fiction  I'd have crashed that  Honda baby  I might be high  In that picture  To be completely honest  What  Can you make that  Bigger sound  Can you open it  That's J.C. Dullas  Who  J.C. Dullas  Was way ahead of us  In broadcasting  When we were still  Trying to make it  He was like the sports guy  On TV already  In Rochester  Worked with Brother Weez 
[00:31:30]  And I was still  In the fucking  In the  In the  In the lower level  Of broadcasting  Did you kind of  Look up to him a little bit  Not really  Rocking  He's rocking the fucking  Satin jacket  And you're rocking  The denim  Right  The same denim jacket  From the mac and cheese party  Sure  Sans tie though  This time  But J.C. Dullas  I mean if I get my friend  Buzzy on the phone  We have a million  Fucking stories  He took us into his house  Like he bought a house  In his twenties  When we still  Were making no money  And me and Buzzy  Lived in his attic  And that was the house 
[00:32:00]  Where Buzzy  Came home completely wasted  And put bacon on the stove  And then smoked out  The entire house  And I woke up  To fire alarms  And I couldn't see  Even my hand  In front of my face  Low crawl  Did you low crawl  And  Dick Van Dyke said  Yeah  Stop drop and roll  And I ran downstairs  And Buzzy's passed out  On the couch  With all this  Dark dark smoke  All around him  I thought he was dead  Because I couldn't  Wake him up  Finally woke him up  He was just drunk  Hammered  There was a huge  Dark black circle  On the ceiling 
[00:32:30]  The house was ready  To go up in flames  It was a smoke  It was basically smoke  And Buzzy finally woke up  And goes  We have to get the smoke  Out of this house  Before JC comes home  So we opened up  All the windows  It was in the middle of winter  Fresh snow around the house  There was so much smoke  That left this house  That all the snow  Around the house  I remember to this day  Turned gray  From the smoke  That was leaving the house  It was really really bad  That's bad  And we're trying our best 
[00:33:00]  I'm giving it  The old college try  Knowing in the back of my head  There's no fucking way  He's not going to know  And then of course  He drives up to his house  To see every window open  With smoke coming out of it  And Buzzy had to  Pretty much clean the house  From top to bottom  And get all his clothes  Dry cleaned  And everything like that  And is that the couch  That was then broken  Oh you remember that story?  Of course  That is the broken couch  That you then propped up  Precariously  Me and Buzzy  I drank with Buzzy  A lot back in those days 
[00:33:30]  And we'd come home  And just do stupid shit  And we used to fucking  Do dumb wrestling  And shit like that  In the living room  And I'm  Nude  Nude  That kiss of the neck  If it helps the story  Sure  We were nude  Nude  Nude  And we're fucking around  And somehow we broke  JC's couch  And JC was a bit  Intimidating  And I think  That was after the fire  He finally got over  The whole fire thing  Jesus  So Buzzy goes  Look this is what 
[00:34:00]  We're going to do  We're going to prop  This fucking couch up  And hopefully  He'll break it  Don't sit on it  No  We actually set up  A whole scenario  So then when he got home  And he was drunk  I started fucking with him  To the point where I knew  He would try to like  Tackle me or something  So he tackles me  Onto the couch  That was already broken  And it was on like  Little  I forgot what  He propped up the leg with  With something  So when JC kind of  Tackled me  He was a bigger guy  The whole fucking  Couch collapsed  He's like  Oh fuck 
[00:34:30]  I broke my couch  Perfect  And then he stumbles  Off to bed  And then Buzzy  Comes running  And takes all the shit  That was propping up  The couch  And now it looks like  He broke it  He broke the couch  So we didn't have to  Pay for that  And then the final story  With him  Buzzy decided to  Get this stupid jeep  And he was trying to  Like you know  Make it into something nice  And he had spray paint  And he was spray painting  Do you remember this story  You guys  You guys were assholes  To this poor guy  Not on purpose  So he had a brand new 
[00:35:00]  Fucking car  And Buzzy's  Spray painting  His piece of shit car  Because we had no money  And I swear to you  Like perfectly  A nice little  Little wind  You know  Kicked up  And we watched  This cloud of yellow  Paint go onto  His brand new  Fucking car  And there's nothing  You can do about it  Nothing  It's slowly just  Moving toward the car  We watched it  And then it was all  Spotty and shit  On the side of his brand new car  I forgot how we  Worked out that one  I forgot  Damn  But we took over  His house man 
[00:35:30]  He was trying to be  A nice homeowner  In his 20s  And we would throw  These ridiculous parties  One of the  Big Tyson fights  That's why when I see Tyson  It brings me back  To living in that house  Because we set up  A huge fucking party  For one of his fights  The one that lasted  What like a minute  Yeah those  And we had TVs  In the backyard  And all that  We had extension cords  Running TVs  In the backyard  We had couches outside  Big tube TVs  Oh yeah  All that shit  But we set up this house  We had TVs all over the house  For the big fight  And then  And then of course 
[00:36:00]  It lasted like 90  Whatever it was  Second  Who did I just see  That worked with you  Years ago  Somebody on the road  From fucking years ago  Buffalo  Yeah  No Kenny told me  Some guy that worked  At the gym  And I recognized his name  Oh right  Right  What was his name  Because Kenny  He didn't remember his name  He was  But when he said his name  I'm like  Was it Mike Benson  I don't know  No there was another radio guy  Mike Benson was a great guy  Up there in the Buffalo area  I want to say a radio guy  Too somewhere else  Might have been in Nashville  Really  Well Nashville would be  Jim Chandler  That's where he works 
[00:36:30]  No it wasn't Jim  I wanted to do his show  Just because of the connection  But I heard that  He hates us  No  No the club owner said  That I think that  They only put on comedians  And it's not Jim's choice  That the company  That pay to advertise  Weren't you a comedian though  You said they only  Put on comedians  Oh you didn't finish that sentence  Oh they only put on comedians  Who advert  Like the club  If the club advertises  With that  And that's a company policy  It's not Jim's policy  Right  Jim  By the way 
[00:37:00]  The girl with the  You know  The smelly badge  You know  She's one of the only  Other girlfriend  Ex-girlfriends  To ever think about  In a nice way  Oh  All the rest  Could go fuck themselves  She must have been  Really nice  She was awesome  You transcend that stench  To remember  She was beyond cool  But we just grew  Like  I had to grow  Because I was  I was a late fucking bloomer  Yeah  And she even tried to deal  With all my nonsense  Through like joining a fraternity  And experimenting 
[00:37:30]  With fucking pot  And cocaine  Oh you said pot  Oh  And she was like  She was like  Straight ahead  She would drink a little bit  But she  She tried to put up  With all that nonsense  She looked a little prissy  In that picture  Prissy  Is that good?  Well yeah  It's kind of  You know  Straight edge  Kind of prissy  Oh yeah  She was wearing  That kind of  Little house on the prairie  Get up there  It's not quite  It's not too provocative  Nah  She was like  She was  You know  And then  I went from her  To another crest  And I'm just saying this again 
[00:38:00]  Because you weren't here  Then I went from  The good Chris  To the bad Chris  That's how my mom  Explains it  My mom didn't like  The bad Chris  She loved the good Chris  And wished we got married  Back in the day  Oh back in the day  This is years ago  I know  But man  Like first fucking  Real chick there  But the other Chris  Was more wild  And more my speed  For the opester's age  But my  The opester needed a wild card  Oh look out  But my mom  Never gave her a chance  Man  Because she missed 
[00:38:30]  She missed good Chris  And she would openly  Tell me  This was the bad Chris  Who the fuck  Was it man  It's the guy in the gym  But there was another guy  Who was  Maybe that was him  Ted  No  No Gregory  I never worked  In a gymnasium  Shred  My friend Shred  We've lost touch  Oh not Shred and Reagan  No those guys I know  But Shred  I look back fondly  No those guys  Have been fucking fantastic  Me and Shred  Used to be really  Really good friends  For many years  But  When I hear the name  He was a PD somewhere 
[00:39:00]  Ew  Then he's not a friend  Friend of mine  I think  I heard you mention  His name nicely  If I can remember  Really  Yeah  A PD  I mentioned nicely  Was I sick that day  He might have been a PD  Nice now  And he wasn't then  Like I don't remember  God now I need to know  I know  I'll go through my head  What stations I did  Oh fudge  Fudge  Fudge  Fudge  Fudge  So whatever  Why  Oh cause Jim Chandler  We like Oedipus  Oh yeah you know what  We did like Oedipus  And we respected Oedipus 
[00:39:30]  He was a music guy though  But he understood like  He understood  Talk radio  Cause he had Howard  For a bunch of years  And I actually had  Mark Pereno  Who he let do some things  I wasn't a huge fan  Of Mark Pereno  But I mean  I understand why  He was successful  And he had Charles  Lacquadera  Charles Lacquadera  The big mattress  So he understood  Yeah I looked up Oedipus  Last time I was in Boston  He was up there  Oh what a pleasant surprise  Oh  He invited me over  To his place  The day we were leaving  So I couldn't do it 
[00:40:00]  I would love to see Oedipus  You know Oedipus  I would love to see Oedipus  The guys that were  Nice to me off the air  Like once we got booted  Off the air  You knew who your friends were  Cause there was no reason  For them to be nice anymore  While you're pluralizing guy  I'm implying  Only one person like you  Off the air  It was  Oedipus was one of the ones  Who would support my shows  Oh meaning you could go back  And still do stuff  Yeah and they would be careful  About show mentions  They were like  And Tim Sabian did  They were nervous about show mentions 
[00:40:30]  Cause they wouldn't get in trouble  But they were still  Decent  But Oedipus and Chachi  Were very very good  There's a comic  On this fucking commercial  What  What's his fucking name  God damn it  That guy  No no no no  That guy  Keep looking  Keep looking  No keep looking  Keep looking  We're running out of people  I know keep looking  Him  Oh yeah that's  Oh I know him  That's  I know exactly who he is  He's funny too  Yeah what's his name  I ain't even fucking business  Fuck  You wanna talk about people  Not having friends  Well then we'll see how that hurts  That was the guy  Who was nice to me 
[00:41:00]  Tom Shulu  Oh that right  Okay  I've done red eye with him  He's very good on red eye  Yes  It's so weird  When you see someone  Out of context  And you're like  Wait I know them  And then it's like  Fuck  I see him  I've done red eye  With him a couple of times  The term you're looking for  Is it's disgusting  When I see a comedian  In a commercial  Making commercial money  Oh oh okay  It's revolting  Yeah  When I see a guy  I've known for 12 to 15 years  Making commercial money  You think that's a lot of money  Yes  You mean that commercial  Yes  Yeah that's probably a good spot 
[00:41:30]  How do we do this  That's a national spot  Well we have to change who we are  Because nobody wants  Fucking nobody wants  To be product endorsed  By us  No  I'm ready to go back  To being the opster man  If it means fucking  Commercials  I'll do it  Get right up there  So there's your  Coca-Cola shirt  I'll fucking put that  Damn thing on again  Just make sure you  Tuck it in  That was so  Boy did we rail  On that one  For a long time  Did you  Did you  I don't remember  I don't remember  It's so good to have  Old tape  It really is

[00:48:00]  On background checks  He's against them  Now it's like  Fuck you on everything  Like fuck the government  I don't want to go along  With any of your shit  Yeah  Alright good  Yeah that won't work  Very well  Good for him  Good for Wayne LaPierre  The thing is  They have  The NRA  Has their constituency  They're not going to  Flip flop on the NRA  So  He's preaching to the converted  It's very hard for him  To get anyone else on board  That's against it  Because they're so  Adamantly against it 
[00:48:30]  This is a very  Polarizing issue  So  Now it's just  Go fuck your mother  That's great  Yeah  That's  Again  And he's just  Simply he's Al Sharpton  They are all the same  He's not the guy  That should be  In charge of  The NRAs  He should be the face  Of the NRA out there  Well  Really  I should be  To tell you the truth  He's hurting your people  A little bit  Yeah  Although the NRA  Is a lot more  Than just this one guy  Unfortunately  He's the guy  But 
[00:49:00]  The average NRA  Member is  You know  A responsible gun owner  Who wants  People to be responsible  Enjoys the background checks  And  If there's any way  That you can actually  Figure out a way  To  Check on people's  Mental health  That would be a good thing  Let's figure that out  He comes across  Like a douche bag  He's a cunt  He is a douche bag  He's a cunt  I'm not a fan of  That guy  I don't like that  He's the head muckety-muck  But then again  I live in a country  Where I'm not  Too happy with the 
[00:49:30]  Head muckety-muck  Here either  So  You know  We all have to deal with it  No no  I understand  And it's like  Every other special interest group  They become  But to be against  Background checks  Yeah  Like  I literally  I won't say what I hope  Happens to him  Yeah  But I hope someday  For whatever reason  That his fucking brains  Need to be cleaned off a wall  Wow  I really do  The guy is just  An absolute  Piece of shit  If you  I don't want to misquote him  If you're against  Any kind of background check 
[00:50:00]  For a gun  I hope that someday  Your fucking brains  Need to be cleaned off a wall  And I hope it's something  That you do yourself  Oh  Because your wife is fucking somebody  Oh  That's what I hope happens  Don't  Don't take it to that level  I hope  Is she fucking  Another special interest guy  Oh no  God  Damn it  Make it hurt  Make it hurt please  Oh  Perhaps  Oh  A Philadelphia  Ah  Wait this  Black Panther 
[00:50:30]  Who stood in front of a voting booth  Oh no  Maybe one of those guys  No I just  If you're that unreasonable  If you're that  Out of touch  And that self-centered  With your own agenda  After what happened  And you don't understand  Why people want background checks  And you would actually fight that  I just  I don't hope he gets shot  Of course  I just  I hope his brains  Need to be cleaned off a wall  Because he's really drunk  And he fucking falls  And he trips  Yeah  And he catches this cock  On the end of the coffee table  And it's ripped off  As his cock is ripped off  He goes ow 
[00:51:00]  And he spins  And he cracks his head  On the fucking radiator  Damn  What you're getting  Is the extremes  On both sides of this issue  First of all  You're getting LaPierre  Who's way too far one way  And then the other  Anti-gun people  Who are way too far the other way  There's no real middle ground here  I absolutely  Understand the tragedy  Of Newtown  I'm not  I'm not that fucking stupid  Or insensitive  But  People that have been exposed  To this kind of tragedy  Should not make policy  This isn't  Like when  When they go to Newtown 
[00:51:30]  To discuss gun control  You're discussing it  With people  Who are too emotionally  Invested  In one side  Of this issue  To really have  A clear vision  Of what need be done  You shouldn't have  People that are  That affected  By something  Making policy  I know  I don't know man  I'm in the air on that one  It's terrible  What happened  But honestly  It's not the norm  This fucking shit  Doesn't happen a lot  It's publicized a lot 
[00:52:00]  You hear about it  School shootings  Oh my god  But the  If you take the  Personal aspect  Out of it  The numbers alone  Do not  Add up  To it  Needing this much  Attention  And this much  Energy  Dedicated to  Taking away  Assault rifles  And what not  But people who've been  The victims of stuff  Yeah  Those are the ones  I want to hear from  Like look at drunk driving  Uh huh  Hearing  We all know  Drunk driving's bad  Sure  But the impact  Is from the people  Who've suffered  The deaths 
[00:52:30]  Of drunk drivers  Uh huh  Those are the people  I want to hear from  Because there are  Almost people  That you can't  Yeah we know  That happens  But  We can't  You know that happens  But  Them away  Do you think  If there were  300  Drunk driving deaths  A year  That we would give  A flying fuck  About drunk driving  It would be  It would be  We wouldn't even  Hear about it  Again  300 rifle deaths  A year  That's it  And not even  Assault rifle  That's all rifles  Assault rifles  And then high capacity 
[00:53:00]  Magazines in assault rifles  You're talking probably  In the  Double digits  Of  Of what they're trying to  So adamantly  Trying to take away  From people  And it doesn't  Figure mathematically  This is where  But this  And if  I'm sure what you're saying  Is accurate  And this is where  The NRA loses you  This is how bad  They are  I fucking try  Really hard  To see both sides  I believe in the  Second amendment  I believe that you  Should have the right  To own guns  And I hate  This fucking guy  And I hate  This organization  Like you know 
[00:53:30]  How fucking  What cunts  They have to be  For me to  Completely side  With liberals  Jesus Christ  You really went  Out of your way  As an organization  To lose me  Completely  I was happy  That they were  Making a press conference  I'm like good  They'll probably say  Something reasonable  Dummy I am  Just like I thought  OJ would be convicted  By a black jury  Yeah exactly  I'm a fucking dope  You gotta realize too  It never works out  In the end  No it never works out  Always the same  Yeah  Shit  A lot of the people  That he's catering to  The constituency 
[00:54:00]  Are a lot of  Middle America  That is a very  Different mindset  From us here in New York  Yeah  Or Los Angeles  Or any of these  Bigger cities  And they look at him  And what he's saying  With a lot more support  Than somebody who's  A little more open minded  I agree  That lives in a more  Liberal environment  Even I  Look at me  I should be  Fucking lapping  This guy's ass  Everything he says  Should be gold to me  With my stamp  His name does have  Lap in it  Yes  Lap  And even I'm like 
[00:54:30]  Like  This guy  When he talks  I'm cringing  Like stop it  What a fucking  Cock sucking  Motherfucker  This guy is  I have such  I literally have  More dislike for him  Than Sharpton  Well no  That will never happen  Even though Sharpton's  Been a bigger cunt  Consistently  Can't he and I  Already get together  And knock  This guy out  Because he  They don't  But they like him  That's the problem  Is he's representing  The majority of the NRA 
[00:55:00]  Like this guy  Absolutely  There are quite a few  That like him  Because I hear a lot of people  That don't like him  And they say they are  NRA  Yeah  You know members  They paraded out  Some other guys  To do some of the  Public speaking  But yeah  This guy  I don't know  You know who you need  Chuck Heston  Now Chuck Heston  When he got up there  And spoke  From my  Cold  Dead  Hands  Yeah that creeps  Everyone out  Oh it creeps  The shit out of it  He's holding a rifle  Over his head  Like back on 
[00:55:30]  Planet of the Apes  That was a hell of a visual  Oh man  And then I thought about  The guy that has to  Find him that way  For everyone within  The sound of my voice  All the dead fingers  Away from the gun  Here he is  For everyone within  The sound of my voice  To hear  And to heed  And especially  For you  Mr. Gore  From my  Cold  Dead  Hands  Hands  Oh no 
[00:56:00]  Yay  Yay  Was that a  Famous movie quote  Or no  No  That's just that  You know  He made a famous quote  They can take  My gun  When they pry it  From my cold  Dead hands  You think he died  That way  No he probably died  With shit in his diaper  Yeah but if you got  From my cold  Wet diaper  If you come up  With that dramatic  Quote  You got people around  You go look 
[00:56:30]  When I do go  Make sure I got  A fucking gun  In my hands  A gun  I want them to  Find me that way  Damn you all  To hell  Damn you  From my  Cold  Dead hands  I will  Part the Red Sea  And use a gun  To shoot  Pharaoh  Wait what  What year is this  He's rolling around  The old folks home  Dude I forgot about this  Bit until today  Remember that  Holy shit  Charlton Heston Traffic  We did Charlton Heston Traffic 
[00:57:00]  Oh my god  Assholes at NAW  Want us to do  Traffic reports  Yes  We're like alright  We'll do traffic  One of my favorites  He's standing in the  Middle of the bridge  And he's like  I'm on the  Tappan Z  Tappan Z  My god  What have you done  To us  What horrors  Have you wrought  Lord  Why  Why an accident  On the BQE  I used to do  Charlton Heston Traffic  Funny though  Can you find  One that might  Well it could work  Either way  It could be so douchey 
[00:57:30]  Like my stupid  Demo reel  Or it could actually  Still work  I don't know  Can you try to find  One during the break  You rock  Let me see what I can do  It was for the time  We got so much shit man  We got some stuff to date  Yay  We got the 49ers player  Oh boy  Is this an Artie Lange  Exclusive  Fuck  I heard  I read the quote on Drudge  And I went to the thing  It was just Artie  Good for Artie Lange  Just fucking around  Asking questions  And it's a big deal today right  Yeah  Front page of Drudge  And this guy's apology  By the way  Did he apologize  For the 49ers dude  I think he did 
[00:58:00]  He said something  To the effect of  What was in his mind  So let's find that  Is different than  What comes out of his mouth  Can we find the apology  Or do we have it here  I think you have it  In the article  Was there audio of it  Or no  Oh in the whole thing  You mean  Oh okay  But I think yeah  Alright  And then we got  I don't think so  We got a radio show  In trouble  Because they  Made fun of a girl  With Down Syndrome  That called the show  Fired  Fired  So fucking  Totally  Completely fired  She was legitimately  Had Down Syndrome  Yeah  See they should have  Just hired her  To work the board  Oh shit

[00:59:00]  Yeah I had a little  Do you know anything else  Because you know him  A little better than we do  No I saw Ron  And you know his people  Better than us  I saw Ronnie for the first time  In a while  At the D-Roast  He was walking back  And we stopped and chatted  That was only a couple weeks ago right  Not even  That was last week  How did he look  He looked great  I mean he's the same as always  You know Ron's heavy  And he put Wade on  Hedgehog  Yeah and he was back  I don't even know who he was with  We just talked for a few minutes  You saw him a week ago  At the D-Snyder roast  What night was that Kenny  It was last Thursday  Last Thursday 
[00:59:30]  It was the first time I saw him  Probably in six months  He had an aneurysm  He's 58  Had an aneurysm  In his chest  I always love Ron  Because everyone's always  He's such a  He's probably the most  Recognizable person ever in porn  More than John Holmes  More than Jenna  Oh yeah  And you know he's always  Like whenever you get his attention  He'll stop  But he's so used to hearing Ron  He's like hey hey hey  Right  And then he stopped  And we chatted  We've had him on numerous times  He's a nice guy  He's a really  He did that thing  With Stalker Patty  And me yes  And you  We touched Patty's pussy together 
[01:00:00]  And she touched Ron's dick  Yes she did  Didn't she have to get money  Or YouTube tickets or something  What was it  Yeah it was definitely  Something taped behind his dick  Or behind his cock  She had to lift up his balls  It's the first time I met Ron  And I got  That was like what  2000 or 2001  And I got a great photo of him  He does that standard  Like big cock thing  Small cock  Like with your hands apart  Like I make my hands far  And he makes his small  He's a nice guy man  I hope he's okay  He's a nice fucking dude  Wait did you do something  I pulled a train with him  You did  Oh yeah  Have you not seen that picture 
[01:00:30]  At the Bunny Ranch  I mean at the Bunny Ranch  I don't have to see your penis do I  No  It was in  I've seen enough  It was in  The Venetian  Right  Dennis who owns the Bunny Ranch  And I knew Ron by this point  I'd seen them on the way  And I was hosting  It was myself and Jenna Jameson  It was January of 2004  It was the 2003 awards  And after the awards show  You know I'm depressed  Because none of these girls  Are fucking me  So Dennis  Like come up to my room  We'll hang out  Which is bullshit  So I go up to Dennis' room  In the Venetian  I walk in 
[01:01:00]  And I do a bit about this  Which is the bit is dead  But Ron was  Standing on the bed  Like fucking a girl  Dennis has some girl  Wait you just walked into this  Oh yeah I walked in  And this was already happening  There's a Bunny Ranch girl  Just sitting there  Dennis is eating pussy  On a table  Dennis Hoff is in a suit  Eating pussy on a table  He's a fucking animal  And Ron  Is fucking a girl on the bed  So I'm trying to flirt  With the other one  Who's not doing anything  And it's not going anywhere  And I'm not 
[01:01:30]  You know obviously  The bit tells the story  But Ron really did say to me  Like I think Dennis goes  Hey man get in there  Whatever  And Ron goes  Hey man  Like to the girl  He's fucking  Like the kid coming off the bench  Girl get in there  Really?  Gee  Oh gee  Thanks a whole bunch  And then Ron goes  Hey man  Like to the girl  About the girl  He's fucking  He goes  I think she needs  A cock in her mouth  So I fucking  You said  I'll go get someone  So  I fucking  You've seen this right?  Oh yeah 
[01:02:00]  That's wonderful  Wait I don't know  If I've ever seen this picture  Jesus  I've never seen this  That's a good pic right there  You're pulling a train  All right  Born quality  That's fucking  Yeah look at it  Sam  It's me and Ron Jeremy  You gotta frame that  That's fucking  I really  I wanna frame it  And put it in your apartment  Oh yeah  This is a great photo  I've never seen that photo before  Oh yeah  And then there's another one  Of Ron and me  He just showed us  An action photo  Dennis took these pictures  Of me and Ron  Fucking this girl  And he was just 
[01:02:30]  He was very playful  About it Ron  He got me blown  I didn't come  I was just so happy  To be on a train  With this legend  Oh yeah  And uh  How do you not come?  It was only for a couple minutes  She blew me  It was Ron Jeremy  And that was the famous story  Where he goes  Hey man you got a nice piece  And uh  Nice piece  He said that to me  And he grabbed her hips  And he gave her like a fucking jolt  And she jumped forward  Oh right  And he was just  He was just joking around  He would fuck with people  On trains and do that  That's hilarious  Yeah but he grabbed her 
[01:03:00]  And she  You know  When Ron  When Ron fucking  Stopped playing games for a second  You know women reacted  Yeah he thrusts  And she like  Lunched forward  Onto your cock  Yeah  Oh that's funny  Yeah I know we're talking about him  Like he's dead  Hopefully he'll be fine  I hope he's alright  It just makes me think  Very very fondly  It sounded horrendous yesterday  But he's hanging in there  So let's uh  Let's hope  He was always cool to us man  He's a very nice dude  He's like  He tells like jokes  He's like you know  Sticky with his jokes  And he's just a nice guy  Do we have the stalker patty bit?  And how long is it? 
[01:03:30]  Let me see  Well just look into it  Him and Dennis are very close  Cause maybe we replay that today  Cause it was really funny  You and uh  You and uh  Stalker patty and Ron  And I hung out with them  We were off the air  Stalker patty  I got photos from like 2003  When they did that Tony Clifton thing  When Zamuda did that  At the comedy store  And of course Dennis Hoff was there  And Ron was there  And you know  Those guys are always together  And there's always chicks around them  You know cause Dennis owns a whorehouse  They're all  Well that helps  That makes it easier right?  There's a weird fucking energy 
[01:04:00]  When those two are around  Where you know you're gonna get your dick sucked  It's amazing  There's always a girl around  That's gonna suck your dick  It really isn't  What a pleasant group to hang around with  It's a win-win  We have any updates this morning?  Yeah  Uh-oh  It's good actually  Yesterday afternoon  The latest is that  Ron had come out of his second surgery  And everything went smoothly  He's resting with complete privacy  And no visitors  He's still  I mean they still say 
[01:04:30]  He's in critical condition  But  Yeah well good for him  His second surgery went well  Well Ron  You know look  Ron put a lot of weight on  And you know  You see him eating  He's a food addict  Obviously  And uh  I'm hoping that this might be the fucking  Maybe this is the jolt he needed to  You know  Sometimes you gotta have a fucking shocking event  To change you  And I'm hoping that he  Slims down again  Cause if you watch  Ron Jeremy footage  Oh early  Ron Jeremy  He's a porn star  Dude he's a fucking  Big dick  Fucking rug chested animal  Fucking  This video of him in tablet 
[01:05:00]  He was in every porno movie  In the orgy scene  He pretty much was  The definitive like  Porn guy  Back in the  In the 70s  And I believe he did stand up  In the uh  Yeah there it is  At one point  Many many years ago  He tried to stand up  And then he did come  Look at him  That's a porn guy right there  Wow what the fuck  Yeah  That's a completely different guy  And he would just  You know  He comes from a very  Smart family too right  I think  I think he told us  That once  You know what  I don't remember  The story  Lawyers or doctors  Or something  Yeah  Oh they put his  Fucking head on 
[01:05:30]  What  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  Yeah  Jesus  Is that really his penis  I guess so yeah  But I guess  Jesus he was being kind  You have a nice piece  Like yeah  Thanks  Really it was just awful  It was a guy with a Lamborghini  Telling him his Saturn  Paint job was nice  But that's  You know  The fact that he put a lot of weight on  Kind of made him more endearing  Like he's just this big dude  With a giant dick who fucks  And he's playful about it  And he's silly  And  Silly  He is  He's a silliness to Ron 
[01:06:00]  Yeah  I have very very nice thoughts  About Ron Jeremy  So I'm hoping he's okay  People love him  I should  I'm going to block out my cock on this  And I'm going to Twitter  This picture of Ron and I  Oh that's nice  Oh you got it  It's a great photo  I never saw that before  I got two  But I won't Twitter  I won't Twitter my cock  You cock  I like my face  How do I block out this girl's face  Yeah you should fool around a little bit  Tinker  I'm going to tinker 
[01:06:30]  Yeah she'll do that a little bit  Hey uh  You want to do some Super Bowl shit  Emily got the radio show  That's going to be in trouble  Oh boy  They're going to fire that guy  Or girl or whoever the fuck  You think he's in trouble  Oh god  He's in so much trouble  He's in deep  I was just reading the transcript  It was just so stupid  Oh boy so fired  He was trying to go for something  And it just failed miserably  There's nothing worse than when something fails miserably  Oh god  And then it costs you your job on top of it  Fails miserably 
[01:07:00]  At least we got fired for some damn impressive shit  Oh boy  Well we got a news reporter in New Orleans  This is great  I don't know if you guys heard this  So I just want to play it  It doesn't need a set up  I do like how Troy talked about how the zombies out here  Because basically what is left is the people walking around with this glazed look in their eyes  And just stumbling  Hey  Like this one behind me  Hi yes  How are you doing?  I'm from California  Oh very nice to meet you 
[01:07:30]  You know  49ers  You're going to do an interview with us?  Sure  Okay because we were just talking about here along Bourbon Street  And the STD rate that's been going on here  And so how long have you had an STD?  I don't have an STD  Oh then why did you want to talk?  Oh my goodness  Oh my gosh I'm so sorry  Are you serious?  Something to be ashamed of  No I don't have an STD  Oh okay  Okay yes  Anyway so I've been taking care of that in my own little way  49ers 
[01:08:00]  So you can see what I've been having to deal with  Out here  And  Wow  That's great  She had it with all the drunks on Bourbon Street  Yeah  So she decided she was going to change the topic  Yeah yeah  The girl just wandered away  We've done the Bourbon Street thing  It's a complete nightmare  But you just got to go with it  Yeah there's no way  What is she expecting?  Yeah I can't believe all the drunks here  It's amazing  I like the clip 
[01:08:30]  But what are you expecting?  That's one of those assignments that you get when you're a reporter  You're just like oh fuck  It's like Super Bowl week  And you're in New Orleans  Alright  You're on Bourbon Street  Yeah it's going to be  It's going to be sloppy  It's going to be some fucking problems  But that's good  You've never seen news people  They're able to actually have a thought on their feet  Yeah I wonder if she got in trouble for that  You're not supposed to use your brain whatsoever  I bet she got in trouble  What do you think you're doing out there?  Well I was keeping the people  No no you don't do that  You don't do that  What is this?  Some kind of comedy show? 
[01:09:00]  Do you think?  What are we?  Comedy Central?  Independent thought on the news?  Yeah  Run this stuff by me before you decide  Oh god  All bits need to be given to me in writing for approval  Wow  What the fuck?  You used to work with us?  10 years ago?  12 years ago?  When that light goes off  Dump out of the show and go to a record  But you could hear in her voice she had it  Yes she has  She's the first shock reporter 
[01:09:30]  Yeah  That should be her new thing  Then we got the Artie Lang thing  Jimmy knows more about the Artie Lang thing than I do  He's down there for the Super Bowl  You know what?  I guess he is  I mean and by the way  The fact that SiriusXM won't send us down there  Oh boy  Good for Artie  I'm happy for him that he got this  He was interviewing this 49ers player  And his personality came through  He just  Like the clip is not a good clip on Drudge  Because it was  When it linked to it was Artie  He's like listening to the clip  But he's talking over it 
[01:10:00]  Because he's listening with someone in the studio or something  So they didn't have a clean cut of the clip  Which is the fault of Drudge  They probably replayed it on the show  And he's asking the 49ers player a question  He got him to say something about gay people  Yeah  But he wasn't trying to sandbag the guy  He was just fucking around  You gay!  You gay!  You're just talking about people at the Super Bowl  I was listening to the wrestling  Pro wrestling show on SiriusXM  SiriusXM  They're down there?  Yeah, live from New Orleans yesterday  That's exciting  You know, we do this break every year  But I have to say it again  I'm just completely baffled 
[01:10:30]  Yeah  And they'll always have a reason why we're not there  Ah, we're just  Year after year after year  But  Everyone else goes  We don't  That's how it is  We've been doing radio together over 18 years now  Not one Super Bowl  What's the issue?  That just amazes me  They were talking about what happened on Monday Night Raw  Live from New Orleans  At Radio Row at the Super Bowl  But it's a SiriusXM radio show?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Sirius sent them  They sent wrestling guys?  Wrestling guys  Oh yeah  I understand they're sending Mad Dog and the sports guys  The mashup's on their way down now 
[01:11:00]  Sway's down there  Why is the mashup going?  They simply  We asked  Are we too expensive to travel?  I don't think so  They sent us to Chicago and Cleveland  Yeah  But they won't send us to the Super Bowl?  No, they won't  They sent you to Chicago for no particular reason  Yeah, we made something of it  But you're absolutely right  There was no reason to go to Chicago  They had fun  The broadcast was really good  But  It wasn't an event  No  We made  It was our event  It wasn't like an event we were covering 
[01:11:30]  Right  We weren't attaching ourselves to a major story  No  We got people that don't have a vision around us  It really is embarrassing at this point  It's really strange  Oh, no  Now they're going to wait outside the door  And explain why we didn't go this year  But my point is  Every year there's a reason why we don't go  Every year we ask  Every year  We didn't give enough notice for this one  Is what it was  But no, we did  What?  You know, the wrestling show was there last year too  The wrestling show  That no one listens to  No, of course not  Because no one knows who they are yet 
[01:12:00]  They've been to  No offense to those guys  But I don't even know their names  They've been to more  Significantly more Super Bowls than you guys  And how long have you guys been doing radio?  I just said over 18 years  So we're up to  We're up to 18  Possibly 19 Super Bowls  We're guaranteed  That we didn't go to  We'll go next year  In fucking Jersey  I'll tell you one thing  I want a first class flight  That goes somewhere  And then comes back to fucking Newark  You're going to get it  You just get it at JFK 
[01:12:30]  And go to Newark  JFK to Newark  I want first class  I want hotel accommodations  I suggest we're stubborn  And don't do it  Oh, and now we don't go  Yeah, fuck you  But it's right there  Yeah, I know  It's right there  So strange  Rotter, rotter  Yep, Artie  Live from New Orleans  Alright, well this is what Artie did  Yep, good for Artie  Chris Culliver  Who's on the San Francisco 49ers  Great player  Cornerback  And I interviewed him  And I'm doing my goofy interview 
[01:13:00]  And I'm asking all sorts of stupid questions  And right in the middle of it  I ask him if there's any gay guys  In the 49ers  And listen to his reaction  And to me this is what the NFL is  Go ahead  And what about gay guys?  Have any of them approached you?  He can't hear you  Nah, I don't do the gay guys, man  I don't do that  Are there any on the 49ers?  Nah  Stop the tape  They don't got no gay people on the team  You know, they gotta get up out of here  Can we stop the tape?  Can't be with that sweet stuff  Is that true?  Yeah, it's true  But they might be able to play well  You're missing one of the most fascinating interviews in history  Nah  Can't be  Can't 
[01:13:30]  Why is the tape still playing?  Nah  Nah  Nah  Okay  So they have to stay  Keep it a secret  I'm sorry, I'm just hearing the tape  In my ear  Ten years later after that  You can't hear anything in your ear?  Well, Chris, listen  I appreciate your time  Good luck in the game  Good luck in the game, man  He's replaying the tape  So why is he talking over his own tape?  I know, right?  Because he was probably going to replay it  Like we would do  We would go  Yeah, you're right  Come on  And he probably just replayed it  And that's the grab they took  Yeah, I'm sure that he replayed it clean  Yeah  By the way, good call, Sam  Artie's live from New Orleans  And there's a special location 
[01:14:00]  And it says  Check out Artie  Set for the week  Set  Come down and join us  If you're in town  We are next to  Marty Girl World  And the Convention Center  Oh, that's nice  And you can see the  See the logos?  The Artie Lang show  Yeah, there's a logo outside  He's got his own little area  He's not on Radio Row  He only started doing his own show  Less than a year ago  Well, that's what happens  When you got someone behind  A radio show like that  It's just  Good for Artie  Good for fucking Artie  I just laughed now  Good for fucking Artie  That's the next level of fame 
[01:14:30]  I just laughed now  How ridiculous  And there'll be a bunch of  And it's like, you know  There'll be a bunch of fucking horse shit  As to why  Well, you know  It was  Radio Row  And you guys  That's  That's  People  Who understand  And look what it does  People around here  Like to downplay stuff  Like, ah, you know  It's not even a big deal  Yeah  That radio  I've heard that over the years  Radio Row  It's like  Well, that was last year's excuse  Remember  Oh, okay  We're going with this year's excuse 
[01:15:00]  Last year's excuse  If you remember  Was  We didn't  You guys didn't want to go to Radio Row  Oh, there's just a bunch of radio people  And then  And then  And then we find out  Like, we're getting some of these amazing interviews  From people  Remember the A-listers  The A-listers  We're marching through  At Radio Row  Madonna was on Radio Row  And we're like, what?  We didn't think you'd want to be on Radio Row  And they tricked us  Because then I go  Yeah, you know what?  Yeah, I don't want to be part of that  Fucking  And it was  Like, amazing  I forgot who  But yeah 
[01:15:30]  It's one after another  But Artie has a set down there  For the week  Oh, man  Just a great setup  And he might have been on  Fat fuck  You know what?  He might have been on Radio Row  During the day, though  Like, he might have got  Because it sounds like  There's a lot of noise behind it  So he may have gotten that  During the day  And replayed it on his show at night  Yeah?  Yeah, because he's on  From 10 to 1  Oh, that's true  So I'm guessing  Artie went over to Radio Row  Because, again  The company probably gives a fuck  About his output  So they decide to get him  A spot on Radio Row  And here  And that  Good for him, man  That Imogene Lloyd Webber 
[01:16:00]  Is pretty fucking cute  Didn't she?  She's alright  Yeah, she's alright  Where is she from?  She's Andrew Lloyd Webber's daughter  Oh, no kidding  Imogene  Imogene  Not Imogene  I thought it was Imogene  No, no, it's Imogene Lloyd Webber  Imogene, whatever  She's British  I was drinking with her  In Breitbart one night  Did you?  She's nice, man  Imogene's nice  She's nice  What a drunk  Fun  Oh, I know  It was great  We were all hammered  No  That's impossible  Exactly  I twittered my picture  God damn it  It's too small

Yeah, delete it  Start over  If you don't like how it came out  I just feel ruined  Let me take a look  Heyo  Heyo  I'll give you my professional opinion  It's too small  Like, I don't know how  Not my  Yeah  You see it?  Yeah  It could have probably been bigger  Nah, it works, though  People get the idea  How do I make it bigger?  Ah, you robot  I don't mean that, Gregorio 
[01:17:00]  Why isn't it big?  I took a screen  Here's what I did  Oh, that looks good  Let me see  Nah, that works  Oh, it's fine  I took the picture of me and Ron  Oh, that  And I put like one of those little speaking  Like a little talk bubble over it  Oh, yes  A little talk bubble  And I wrote Lucky Girl in it  To block my cock  And then  So is her knee talking and saying Lucky Girl?  Yeah  That's where the pointy thing goes  Well, that's to cover her nipple  I dragged it down  Oh  Oh, good one  And then what I did  Yeah  Was I took  I clicked the iPhone button  That takes a photo of your 
[01:17:30]  A screen cap photo  Yes  And that's the picture I used  Oh  So nobody can go in with any software  That might remove that thought bubble  And have my cock sticking out like that  And then imply that that's the photo  Like literally  If you do something  Let's say that you have a program  Uh-huh  Where you swirl your face or whatever  Yes  There are programs that they can take  That will unswirl your face  And show the original picture  No way  Really?  Yeah  I haven't heard that  Oh yeah  I've seen it done to child molesters  Which is great  Oh  But this one  They can't  Like maybe if I just put the regular picture up 
[01:18:00]  Or I put the thought bubble  There may be a software that can go in and take that thought bubble away  I don't know  I don't know if there is or not  But what else  Yeah you're pretty interesting  You'll be alright  Um  I got a really dumb question  I got the Samsung  Uh  S3  I don't know how to  I don't know how to screen cap  Oh shit  Don't you just say screen cap  I don't know how to do it on this  Just say screen cap into it  I'm gonna need screen cap  I don't know how to do it  Swipe  I'm embarrassed 
[01:18:30]  Someone go swipe your screen with your hand upward  Upward  That's all it is  Go ahead  Ah  No  What are you doing  It's not that  No you don't know how to work this  Swipe your whole hand up  Really  Up the screen  Like this  Your whole hand  I was trying to squeeze in  Your whole hand  What do you mean my whole hand  Take your whole hand and go like this  Alright hold on  So with this  The palm of your hand  Go with this  Yeah  No  Side to side  Not up  Side to side  Mother

[01:20:00]  Odds are  There's some fucking gay players  On the 49ers right  We're in the NFL  I would guess  Or in the organization  That are around the locker room  Yeah  Odds are  There's probably  You know  A handful  Yeah  Football teams  They're quite large  A lot of people  On these teams  And then you got  The locker room people  In and out  And stuff  Chances are man  There's a couple gay guys  Looking at that guy's dick  Some of these black guys  They don't like  The idea of gay 
[01:20:30]  There's a lot of homophobia  Even more so  In the community  In the community  Yeah yeah  But that's why they have  You know  Guys that are on the DL  You know  They don't want to be  Out there  So they have the girlfriend  They that  And then when they go out at night  They be sucking some  Cock  Suck that  It makes my day  When I just run into him  Oh yeah  I do get excited  When I see Ira in the halls

[01:21:30]  For saying that  Is he getting  Oh you've apologized  In writing  Oh his apology  What did the apology say  Daily News  Oh yeah  Oh sorry  You get the apology  Over there  So basically  Those guys are being interviewed  Every day  And you know  They're all gonna get in trouble  Unless they're just giving that same  Cookie cutter  Horseshit  Cookie cutter  Exactly  Are there a lot of openly  Gay players in the NFL  No  Not openly  No I saw one on 
[01:22:00]  Ellen  Kicking a fucking  I think a punter  What was his apology  New York Post  Let's read it  Sorry I was just mentioning  The newspapers  That already got mentioned in  Because he was down  At Super Bowl Sunday  And did an interview  Oh  Why would they send us  He said  The apology said  The derogatory comments  I made yesterday  Were a reflection  Of thoughts in my head  But they are not  How I feel  Alright  What does that mean 
[01:22:30]  This is a new angle  I like this  Right there  He's like  These are thoughts in my head  Right  But I don't mean them  He goes on to say  It has taken me  Seeing them in print  To realize that they are  Hurtful and ugly  Nah some don't do that  Those discriminating feelings  Are truly not in my heart  Further  I apologize to those  Who I have hurt and offended  And I pledge to learn and grow  Well can they stop  Having white people  Write statements  For black people  Here's what his real apology  Would have been  Yo man that shit was fucked up 
[01:23:00]  Sorry  Yeah yeah  Oh that shit was whack  Sorry man  If I don't see THO  I don't believe a black guy wrote it  Dope  Sorry  Right the end of the fucking  Dope  Statement should be dope  So he said that  The thought was in his head  But it's not in his heart  Right  So he didn't mean it  That's bullshit  That's a bullshit fucking statement  Statement  In that city  You idiot  In San Francisco 
[01:23:30]  Yeah yeah yeah  You out of your fucking mind  Yeah it was kind of dumb  Are you out of your  That's the city that pays your salary  What's wrong with you  Then again he was ass  But all he had to say was no  Yeah  But what the hell  I mean that's how he thinks  Fine  Yeah  I don't mind people  Fucking saying  How they think  Why do they have to apologize  It's such fucking bullshit  What he said will certainly piss off a lot of people  But that's what he feels  It's gonna cost him money  What happened to just saying what you feel  Nobody wants to hire 
[01:24:00]  How much money  I mean who knows  But nobody wants to hire somebody for endorsements  After they say  He's homophobic  Yeah after he's homophobic  We can't have homophobic  It's too bad man  Homophobic  A couple more years  You're never gonna know what people are thinking  No  A couple more years  The reflection  You'll know how they feel  But you won't know the thoughts in their head  Uh huh  They're two different things  By the way  By the way  I wasn't alone Ant  You just helped out a lot of people

[02:01:30]  Alright here we go  We know the shit  Okay  I thought the guy would be fired so far  He's not gonna get fired  He's just a dope  He's a dope  He's a dope that couldn't make anything out of that  He desperately wanted to make something out of it  Yeah  And he felt horribly flat  But she never said that she had down  And how does anyone  I don't know  Did someone listen to this  And hear how she was speaking  And think  Oh that girl has down  And he was barely making fun of her  Yeah  He didn't know what the fuck to do this  He didn't know if it was a prank or if it was real 
[02:02:00]  He wanted to do something  But he just didn't have  He just didn't have it  The skill set  I want to say that  You can  But he didn't have the skill set  Is that the entire call?  Pretty much  That's pretty much it  I read the transcript  Yeah pretty much  That's it  So  Pretty much  What the fuck is the problem?  I don't know  And who ratted him out that that was a girl with down syndrome?  And  They came in and she was crying I think and eating the phone  What's wrong?  Yes I'm a comedian and I did a retarded joke  Sorry  I know you did  Here's the news story  Here's the news story 
[02:02:30]  Let's try to figure this shit out  You know the saying  There's no such thing as bad publicity  Well I'm not sure that's true  Just ask a local radio station  Oh boy  DJs make  I feel all  I get the cringies when I hear that  Because I'm waiting to hear my name  In the news  They're just a bunch of cunts  Yes  I hate that local radio station  Local radio host  You know who they are  Just fucking say it  A local radio show  A local radio  How about  Like your news agency 
[02:03:00]  Edited tape  Right  To make it sound  To fit our agenda  Right  What they're basically trying to say  Is we're better than  The local radio station  Yeah  No you're not  No you're not  No you're not  You suck  DJs made fun of a woman with down syndrome  And now they are hearing it  From all over the country  And hiding behind their lawyers  Paul or loud  Oh fuck you  Hiding behind their lawyers  Get this broad on the phone  Oh man  They were barely  That wasn't making fun of anyone with down syndrome 
[02:03:30]  That was the DJ  Like you said  Trying to make something  Of the fact that he couldn't understand the girl  I don't even think he knew why he couldn't understand her  He said are you from this country  Right  Do you have a speech impediment  Right  Like that  He was trying to make something of it  But he wasn't  That was anything but making fun of down syndrome  Right  I don't  I completely agree with you  We get people like that  Calling us from time to time  Yes every call  Yes exactly  They have a weird speech impediment  Where you have a little fun with it 
[02:04:00]  It's called food in their mouth  But this guy  Fucking fatties  This guy  This guy didn't even get anything going  No he didn't  And now he's hiding  They're hiding behind lawyers  Really  Oh they're just stupid  DJs made fun of a woman with down syndrome  And now they are hearing it  From all over the country  And hiding behind their lawyers  Paul Orlowski with the story  Admittedly not the easiest to understand 
[02:04:30]  A phone call to a Canton area radio station  Made by Kelly Baker  A 30 year old with down syndrome  Repeatedly she tries to end the call  But a DJ who calls himself Moe on WDJQ  Keeps her on the air  At one point he asks her if she knows who Moe is  She says no  His reply has a mocking tone  But do you know who Moe is?  No  You don't know who Moe is?  No  Okay  So I can laugh at you  And you won't know who to call  And say you're offended  Very good  Totally  Totally out of context 
[02:05:00]  Again  Totally  They don't put in context  The fact that no one ever said  During the course of that call  That she had down syndrome  Right  They're making sure you know that  They said  I don't know if you knew that  Making fun of a down syndrome  He absolutely had no clue  She had down syndrome  And then they start the story by saying  Jock was making fun of a girl with down syndrome  Right  And then they play that clip  To make it sound like  He's goofing on her  Because she has down syndrome  When the fact is  He's just goofing on her  And that he knew  They're implying  These fucking 
[02:05:30]  These  Again  The news are such  Scumbags  Implying  That he had prior knowledge  That she had down syndrome  And was purposely making fun of her  I got the whole transcript  There's nothing in here  That would  Nothing  Show that  For all he knew  He was being pranked by somebody  How the fuck does he know?  Well I mean  It could have been someone drunk  It could have been someone with  Even hearing problems  Speech impediment  I miss when we used to  Work for regular radio  And people would dial us by accident  Oh yeah  Those were so much fun  We've had plenty of great calls 
[02:06:00]  And that's the case here  When you realize she's a little confused  But she can be confused  Because she wasn't expecting  To call the radio  Exactly  But people hit the wrong button  She was off by nine  But it happens  People dial the wrong  Is that the one that has the down syndrome?  Yep  Yeah  Really?  Holy Jesus  She looks like Billy Bob's girlfriend  In Sling Blade  She doesn't even  Oh  Melinda  Yeah  With the flowers  She doesn't have the look  A little bit of the look  A little?  She's gussied it up 
[02:06:30]  With a very unconventional hairdo  And the glasses  Because the hair looks very nice  It's a normal hairstyle  That is an unconventional hairdo  I know  Because I don't know  I'm just saying  A lot of times  You'll see a hairdo  That's better suited  For Mia Wallace  You know  Well let's get back  To this dumb news  Right  Report  I don't know who to call 
[02:07:00]  Say you're offended  Very good  I am  Booker  That's my friend  Okay right  And the man that answered  The phone though  Was at the radio station  Yes  And it seemed like  He kept asking you  Over and over and over  To repeat  Yes  I'm sick of everything  I don't like it  He felt that this person  Was different  You know  They didn't speak  Proper English  Oh my god  This speech impediment  He wants to have a little fun  Well that's  Yeah  Because that's what people do  Oh my god  Fuck you  They went and interviewed  This woman  Fuck you  What a bunch of vultures 
[02:07:30]  Yeah  Yeah  We all do that  Yeah  They wanted to get  The retarded person  On camera  That's exactly it  Wow  Yeah  That's what they do  Wow  Fuck you  Are you kidding me  Ugh  Yeah we kind of make fun  Of stuff that  Is a little different  Yeah  What they're saying is  People  Something was different  Meanwhile  They just want to show you  And capitalize for real  Right  On this retarded person  But if you make fun of it  You're terrible  Oh yeah  It's all smoke and mirrors 
[02:08:00]  I guarantee you  They didn't cover  It's their version of the freak show  They didn't cover the MSNBC edit  Or the fucking George Zimmerman call edit  Or any of the other fucking news edits  Wow  With the same mock outrage  The same  Yes  Yes  Ugh  These fucks  These fucking  I wish more news people  Were killed in the line of duty  Ah  Like standing there  Doing a report  And a car just hits them  Ah would that be great  Right  The only ones I like  Are the ones who were like  Shot in Syria  Those are the only reporters  I respect anymore  Are the ones that actually  Go over and cover the war 
[02:08:30]  Right  They're the only ones  With integrity  Wow  You know  They didn't speak proper English  They had this speech impediment  He wants to have a little fun  Well that's not okay  Luckily Kelly has a supportive family  Their push back at the radio station  Began almost immediately  A sister called  Mo within minutes  She let him have it pretty hard  And he said  Hey  She called the radio station  She should be aware of who she's calling  It's fair game  You may think that a good way to handle this  Would be to have Kelly  Down here to the radio station studios  Give her a tour  And apologize  At least say something right 
[02:09:00]  No way  All we got was the telephone number  Scribbled on a note  From behind a closed door  Of the station's lawyer  Everybody looking out for you  Yes  I'm so proud of them  In my heart  I'll take her message over Mo's  Every day of the week  Oh shut the fuck  Shut up  You pandering cunt  Shut up  And I love when they're  What's her message  You don't understand it  Right  And I love when they're surprised  When the person will not talk to them  Right  What  Why do I have to talk to you

[02:15:30]  Out of her positive  Pregnancy test  Test tube  What  Man you don't like kids  What  You just don't like them  Nah  Kids are a real  Big pain in my  Fucking ass  What is  Is there Facebook  What's her name  So let's get her on the air  Is that the woman  Who started the whole thing  Denise Dufala  That's her  That's the anchor  That's the anchor  Of the story 
[02:16:00]  That exaggerated a little bit  So she's on Facebook  Left a few key things  Out of there  Left some key things  Out of there  Like the fact that  He had no clue  And nothing was ever said  That she had down syndrome  Yeah that sounds like  They found that out  After the fact  How about the fact  That she inadvertently  Called the radio station  Was that  Was that even stated  In the story  Or did it sound like  He called her  Or pranked her  We got some Cleveland people  We're big in the Cleveland area  We're fucking huge Daryl  We sure are  Jim Norton  Tim in Cleveland 
[02:16:30]  What's up buddy  Hey channel  Channel 19 news  Not exactly a credible  News source there  Keep that in mind too  Actually  I don't know  About that  Denise Dufala  Name one that is  Credible at this point  My god  That's true  Once Cronkite left  It was all over  Yeah exactly  Yeah hey  I mean  That channel's got  A lady on the news  That a couple years back  Was down in spring break  On a wet t-shirt contest  Her stuff's out  On the internet  Had another lady  She's not there anymore 
[02:17:00]  I don't know  A couple years ago  There was a guy  Wait one of the reporters  Was down  In spring break  Down in spring break  Doing a wet t-shirt contest  That's kind of funny  I changed my  My apologies  To that news  Yes  Fine people  Fine  Upstanding people  That's great  That's great  Yeah you know  They had another one  Who's  I don't know where she is  Rumor has it  She's  She got knocked up  By LeBron  When he was here  But when she was here  She was covering  I mean she was  She was an anchor  In the afternoon  I think 
[02:17:30]  And she went out  And  Did she  Did she go away  So they had to  Sail anchors away  All right  Thank you brother  Before we go back  Did that stink  Oh it stunk  We're going to do  A Cleveland sandwich  With Boston in the middle  Meaning we'll do  This Boston call  Then we go back  To Cleveland  What do you got Eric  Yeah I just want to say 
[02:18:00]  This is a  Fruit addiction  It's not a perfect example  Of that Colin Quinn quote  People love to  Celebrate diversity  As long as you don't  Point out anybody's different  Yeah  Yeah  It's that exact thing  Because  That's not Colin's quote  I said that  Oh Jimmy  Well you quoted him  But well done anyway  Oh well  He just doesn't  That's the thing  By doing this news story  You basically  Disempower her  By saying  Hey she's not capable  She's 30  But she's not capable  Of taking a joke 
[02:18:30]  And if you actually  Which he didn't  Point this out  But if you point out  That she's a little bit  Different  You're so not a monster  And she needs to be  Apologized to  And she can't handle it  But the thing is  She's not different  Like here's the thing  She's retarded  And I'm saying that  Like there's nothing  Wrong with saying that  She's mentally retarded  For some reason  They think that by saying  People who are different  They just avoid the word  Yeah  They avoid the obvious  Because they make it dirty  Right  Like she's mentally retarded  Okay 
[02:19:00]  There's nothing wrong with that  There's nothing  To be ashamed of in that  He actually treated her  More normally  Than anybody else  In that scene  Right  Right there  Fucking treated her  Like anybody else  That would have called  The only point I want to make  Is they're making it sound  Like the guy  Absolutely knew  She had Down syndrome  And went after her  He had no fucking idea  The news assumed  All that shit  You're terrible dude  You make a good point though  We can't point out  Anyone's differences anymore  But we love embracing diversity 
[02:19:30]  Which is  That's such a lie  Which is differences  Right  And it doesn't  I call any rules  Whether you do a radio show  You're on TV  Or just in the stupid workplace  You can't point out  Anything different  We're all supposed to be  The exact same fucking person  Yeah  You can only point out  By the way  Ethnically  Or whatever  Unless you're showing  A positive stereotype  Like there's such  People in the Asian community  Are just typically hard workers  No one would ever object  People love a positive stereotype 
[02:20:00]  They don't like a negative  Right  Like if you say  People with Down syndrome  Work harder  No one would object to that  Maybe it's a stereotype  But because it's positive  People with Down syndrome  Aren't as smart  Oh that's terrible  You're mean  Yeah  It's a fucking  We literally have become a country  Of fucking little children  Who need positive reinforcement  And if you say anything negative 
[02:20:30]  We're going to kick and scream  Until you take it back  Yes  It's an embarrassingly  Dishonest state of mind  When did this all happen?  Embarrassingly dishonest  It all started with the baby boomers  That's when it started  Oh  The baby boomers  We're not baby boomers  Are we?  Assholes  No no  How old are those fucks?  60  Alright  Jesus  Let's go to Tony  Back in Cleveland  Tony it's all about you guys today  Tony Tony  Boboni  Banana  My name's not Tony  Son of a

I used to be 6'7 and a half  But after my knee operation  I think I'm only 6'7  Oh wow  He's lost a little bit  You don't realize that  When you're watching a guy  Coming out of Milwaukee  Oh Jesus  No  You're right  Guy sitting there being interviewed  Like I watched the documentary  It's like you don't realize  Like you're a big imposing figure  Boy you must have had a ball  Before these cameras  And everything  That law enforcement  Has to deal with now  Oh boy  I bet you could  Spin a yarn or two 
[02:42:00]  We know some of the old school guys  Oh I love talking  You don't have to say anything  We know  Old school detectives  Evil  Yeah  They're evil  Some of the stuff  That might have been  Not quite on the books  You learn that from  The streets  Yeah sometimes  You know what  You don't even have to  Take the perp back  To the station house  I can just deal with them  A little street justice  A little wood shampoo  They call it  Right  Yeah  You get more with honey  Than vinegar  But yeah  A lot of times  You let the guy go 
[02:42:30]  Because they were useful  To you later on  There you go  Exactly  God I love the old school guys  God they had to play it  They knew how to play  In the streets  Wow  How did you stumble onto  Becoming a part of  The Dahmer case  Like you were just  A regular working detective  Right  The way they run it  In Milwaukee  Is they just have  The homicide units  And the next stiff up  You get it  So I walked in  I was third shift  I walked in that morning  Is that what they call  The next stiff up  Well  We usually have a 
[02:43:00]  Saying in Milwaukee  That our day begins  When yours ends  I know it's blue humor  I can see that  On the t-shirts  You can sell some t-shirts  But in Milwaukee  It was  It's just the next unit  That was up  And my unit was up  I just walked in  And before I could  Even get to my desk  About 10 to 12  At midnight  The lieutenant  Called me over  And said  I got a couple  Excited cops  On the phone  That said  They got a head 
[02:43:30]  In the refrigerator  Wow  And he didn't even  Really believe it  This guy was  Lieutenant Roosevelt  Harrell  He was the highest  Ranking black  Officer on the department  At the time  Milwaukee had gone  Through a lot of  Racial problems  With the police department  Totally an excellent  Guy though  And he said  It sounds like  Bullshit to me  Go check it out  So on the way up there  I was with this  Young Polish kid  From the south side  Mike Dubas  And we were making jokes  And I was like  Not lose our head  Over this investigation  It was 
[02:44:00]  You know  It just seemed so weird  Have you met  Tom at this point yet  Or no?  No  Never met him before  And I want to ask  Just because  You look like a young guy  How young were you  Back then?  20 years ago  I was 38 years old  Wow  I was young  I was a lot younger  Yeah  I'll be 59 next month  See you on the job  For a while  By the time  Oh yeah  I walked the beat  For several years  And hacked the squad  For about 9 years  Saving the world  Full of piss and vinegar  Well I was married  With 3 kids  I was trying to raise  A family  Or that  And it was a solid job 
[02:44:30]  With benefits  Alright or that  Whatever  Health insurance  I get you  Stability  Did you see Q&A  With Nick Nolte?  I did  I feel like I'm  Sitting next to Mike Brennan  It makes me so happy  Big guy with a mustache  Old school  So you're making the jokes  On the way over  We know you cops  Like to make jokes  Because it's  You know  It is  Lightens up the mood  A little bit  Emergency room personnel  The nurses too  Are like that  Yeah yeah  You got it  But it was a very hot  Sticky night  I know it gets hot here too  But it gets real muggy  In Milwaukee too  And it was one of those nights  Where it didn't drop 
[02:45:00]  Below like 85  And 100% humidity  And the foyer  Of this building  Is a big glass  Enclosed foyer  And as soon as you  Walked in there  You could smell the dead body  Wow  And most  And I looked at Mike  I said wow  Maybe this ain't gonna be bullshit  And actually I took off my coat then  Because certain fibrous coats  If you're around real dead body  It'll seep into the clothes  Like Chinese food or something  Where you smell it  When you leave the restaurant  Oh Jesus  Was he  Were there other people  Living in that structure?  Oh yeah  It was a three story 
[02:45:30]  36 unit rectangular building  The hell's with people?  That's why I asked  They didn't  Well actually several people  Had complained  About the smell  Over the months  About the smell  And to the building super  Who I talked to  And when he went  To talk to Jeffrey Dahmer  About it  He had a 55 gallon  Fish tank  And he told him  That he went to Chicago  For the weekend  And the power went out  And his fish tank  And all his fish died  And he left them around  And that's what was  Causing the smell  And he actually showed him  The plastic garbage barrel  That he was using 
[02:46:00]  To emulsify people  With the muriatic acid  And the guy said  Well just get rid  He said that's where  I put all the fish  And he said  Just get rid of that  Oh my god  And actually  The night we went in there  Very clearly displayed  Were all kinds of  Solvents, cleaners  Air fresheners  The 57 gallon  Tank that he had  The four bodies in  He had by a window  In his bedroom  With a fan behind it  Blowing the  Wow man  This is some  Calculated stuff  He said that he  The smell was always  A problem  That was what he said 
[02:46:30]  Just couldn't get rid  Of that fucking stench  But how were you guys  Tipped off that there  Were heads in this place  At this point  Well what had happened  Is  His last victim  He had run out  Of the Halcyon tablets  And Jeffrey Dahmer  Was an alcoholic  He was always gassed  Always gassed  And he thought  He could drink this guy  Under the table  And he said  They put down  A bottle of 151 rum  They were both gassed  And he had offered this guy  $150 to come home  For oral sex  And to watch movies  And to take some 
[02:47:00]  Photographs of him  Which he was  Let's not forget  That everybody  Who went to his apartment  Went there willingly  Right right  He didn't drag nobody there  He offered  Mostly offered them money  For sex and photographs  Well he had taken  A couple photographs  Of this guy  In his whitey tighties  And then he wanted  To get a  A bondage  Shot of him  He got the one  Handcuff on him  But when he tried  To put the other  Handcuff on him  I talked to the guy  I said  It just didn't seem right  And I told him  No I don't want  To do that  And Jeff's thought 
[02:47:30]  To me was that  He had ran out  Of the Halcyon tablet  So he thought  He'd get this guy drunk  And once he got him  Handcuffed  Then he could just  Scratch it  What's a Halcyon tablet?  Halcyon was a very strong  Sleeping pill  That came out  During the Gulf War  If you remember  President the first bush  The good bush  Not shrub  He actually took it  Because he couldn't  Get to sleep  And it was a brand new  Sleeping tablet  And it was  It was marketed  That it was the kind  Of pill  Where you didn't  Just get drowsy 
[02:48:00]  But you took it  And you're out  For a while  So  Would he slip it  Into their drinks?  Yes  Before when he knew  He was going to kill somebody  He would crush up  Five to seven of them  And hand them in a cup  At home  So when he brought  The guy home  If he knew  He was going to  Kill this guy  And keep this guy  The first thing  He would do  Is offer him a drink  And he would  Pour him a rum and coke  Holy shit  And once you drank that  You're out  Why did he get lazy  And not have that on hand?  Well he was one of the first guys  To do what we call  Doctor shopping  He was a third shift worker  At the chocolate factory  And he went to several  Different doctors  And told them 
[02:48:30]  I can't sleep at night  And I found this  Healthian  Actually there was  An article in Time magazine  About Healthian  In 1991  And that's where  He heard about it  Wow  So he asked about it  And the article  Was about Bush taking it  And so he'd ask  For it by name  And there were  Several doctors  That gave him pills  But he just ran out of them  Okay I got you  Damn  So he brings this guy home  He does not have him  Pilled up  And he said  The guy  Instinct kicked in  And said there's something  Wrong with him  Well he didn't want it  He said he just felt  Weird about it 
[02:49:00]  So when he wouldn't do it  Then he and Jeffrey  Got into a fight  And during the fight  Dahmer picked up a knife  And he ran out  The apartment  Ran down the hall  Ran out into the street  And down the block  Was a couple  Milwaukee coppers  On a completely  Different assignment  Wow  So here it is  1130 at night  Quarter after 11  At night  On a hot  Muggy night  And this guy  Pounds on the window  The two cops look at  Here's a black male  With just whitey  Tidy underwears on  And handcuffs  And the first thing  They thought was  Hey  They got in the air  And they said 
[02:49:30]  Is anybody missing  Any equipment  Like you know  It's very embarrassing  When a prisoner  Gets away from you  Ruins your reputation  But when nobody answered  They got out  And said  Hey  What the fuck's going on  And he said  Well I met this guy  And we were fucking around  And he wanted to take some pictures  And I didn't want to do the bondage  And we got in a fight  And he pulled a knife on me  And I'm out here  And I said  Well do you want to press charges  Let's take him  He goes  No I really don't want to press charges  I just want this handcuff off  Well the two coppers got out  But we had Smith and Wesson handcuffs  And Dahmer had a different type 
[02:50:00]  Because he had different handcuff keys  They had to go back to Dahmer's house  He didn't work  Oh god damn  So they followed the guy back  Knocked on the door  Jeffrey Dahmer opened the door  And he was gassed  And they even said to him  Look we don't care  What you freaks are doing in there  But just give us the handcuff key  Well he kind of fumbled around  And like most cops  They just bogarted their way in  And he kind of fumbled around  So they started looking for the key  But there was no key  Because he always got the handcuffs back  By cutting off their hands  Oh my god  Holy shit  So uh  There ain't no key Ralph 
[02:50:30]  You got a boot  He got them off  By cutting off their fucking hands  So one officer went into the bedroom  And found the top drawer open a little bit  And there was all these Polaroid photographs in there  So he picked up a photograph  He saw the photograph  Of a dismembered and cut open body  Wow  He told me  He said the first thing I thought was  Where did this guy get these autopsy photographs from  But he said the more I looked at the photograph 
[02:51:00]  The more I realized the room in the photograph  Was the room that I was standing in  Oh god  So he said to his partner in the next room  It was an efficiency apartment  Like one main room  A bathroom  And a little bedroom  Uh huh  He said you better handcuff this guy  And when he said that  All hell broke loose  And there was a big fight  Oh really  Two big strong Milwaukee cops  One 6'4 about 220  The other about 6'1  And kind of barrel chested  The taller guy was  Kind of a nice guy  But the other guy  I wouldn't call him an assaultable officer 
[02:51:30]  But the kind that would respond  In kind of  Sure  And  How big was Dahmer by the way  He was a good sized man  He was 6'1  About 175 pounds  Um  Good looking guy  Uh  The night that I arrested him  I had to take all his clothes off  So I got to see him buck naked  There wasn't an inch of body fat  On the guy  I mean he was  Yeah  I hear humans are lean  Not a muscular guy  But not unmuscular as well  Um  So yeah  These two officers  Had a hell of a fight  With this guy  Wow 
[02:52:00]  When I got there  Um  Well after they  They  Finally got him corralled  And like any place  It's not good to fight  With the police  Uh  So  After they finally got him  Corralled and handcuffed  They had him handcuffed  The way we used to do it  Where you hogtied people  Where you handcuffed  Behind their back  And cuff their  Their legs  And put them on their stomach  And then cuff your legs  To your hands  Oh wow  But you know  We ended up killing  Everybody like that  Or  Well  They found that people  That were big  Or that were under  Um  Some kind of drugs  They  A lot of guys died 
[02:52:30]  In that position  Suffocated in some way  Shape or form  So they changed that  Before  When I first came on  They taught us to choke people out  Yeah the choke hold  Yeah choke them out  Some people never came back  They went from that  To this other one  And now they  They don't do that anymore  But at the time  That was that  If you saw a prisoner  Like that  You knew  That some bad shit  Had happened  So when I got there  He was bleeding  From the mouth  And had a massive  Like rug burn  From where  Like rolling around  On the rug  And these two  Officers  I mean 
[02:53:00]  One was outside  The door  His hair was sticking up  His Sam Brown  Was to the side  He was all disheveled  Hot nights  When he was dripping  With sweat  And I  So I walked up  I said  Ralph what's going on  I just go look  In the refrigerator  Oh wow  Holy shit  So then I walked  Into the apartment  And there was Dom  Around the ground  And he was  He was crying  I mean he was  He knew it was over  Johnny  And the other  He was that  Fridge door  Fucking suction  Sound came  The bigger officer  Had his knee  In him  And I said to him  I said  Ralph what is going  He looked the same 
[02:53:30]  His eyes were real big  And he was sweating  He was wiping his face  With a hanky  And I said  What's going on  I just  Just look in the refrigerator  So that's when I went  And opened up the refrigerator  And once you opened it up  It was an apartment  Size refrigerator  It was empty on the inside  Except on the door  There was condiments  You know  A1 sauce  Lee and parents  Mustard and ketchup  But in the middle  The only thing that was  In the middle  Of this refrigerator  In the back  Was an open box  Of Arm & Hammer  Baking soda  And I thought  My ma used to do that  To kind of freshen  The thing  And a box 
[02:54:00]  Containing  The head  Of a black male  And it was  Freshly severed  And fresh  And the eyes  And the mouth  Like that  Wide open  Wow  When I opened it up  My partner said  I backed up to him  And screamed like a girl  Oh shit  I didn't  But I do remember thinking  Oh man  I gotta get the fuck out of here  I mean it was really  I mean I knew  I wasn't in danger  But it's so irrational  Fear to see something like this  Yes  And I'd only been  Working in the homicide unit  For about a year  So I knew  Hey if you walk out of here  That's the end of your career  But 
[02:54:30]  Right  Yeah  So that's how it started  Wait  You said there were two though  Where was the other one  Two cops  No you said there were two heads  No  No in the refrigerator  Just one head  Now we found  In a little freezer  We found seven other frozen heads  Okay  And we found three skulls  Right  So Pat took  Dahmer downtown  And then the medical examiner  Who we also interviewed  For the film  Dr. Jeffrey Jensen  Sort of came in with his guys  And started taking out  All the rest of the evidence  And that's when the  The size and the scope  Of the scene 
[02:55:00]  Actually came  Right  I left my partner there  Harrell showed  Well first I saw  I said don't anybody  Touch anything  Yeah  We got a boss down there  And he said  Take him downtown Pat  So my partner actually  Got the shittier end of the deal  He spent the next 24 hours  You know  Discovering penises  And heads  And skulls  There was all that stuff  It was all in there  Right  They're telling us  Pat has five minutes  Because these guys  These guys have TV  Wow  These guys have TV  To promote  Are you kidding me  We're just going to start  I literally was hoping  You could stay until 10.30  They have TV 
[02:55:30]  I love this stuff  Okay  Can we stay  They're telling us  They have TV  This is a really big radio show  You should stay right here  I'm telling you  Right now sir  If you want people  To see this film  You should stay right  The fuck before you are  When you met Dahmer  I have to ask you that  What was the first  How did you actually  You're meeting with him  With this guy  Who I don't think  You understood the scope  Of what a psycho he was  At that moment right  No but I mean  I had never seen  I mean  I had run of the mill murder  And I've had my  Run of the mill interrogation 
[02:56:00]  And confession  But this was different  From the beginning  Because well first of all  He was  They beat the snot out of him  Because you just don't fight  With the police  So as we were taking him  From the apartment  To the paddy wagon  He was already  You could see dejected  And so I decided  I would take a  Kind of a lighter tact  With him  And I shook his hand  Called him Pat  I went and got a cup of coffee  And cigarettes  And the first thing  I said to him was  So can you tell me  About that in the refrigerator 
[02:56:30]  And his first statement  To me was  Well his first statement  To me was  You're not going to let him  Beat me anymore  Oh wow  I said no  No one's going to deal  With you anymore  But me  And I had him  In that little  9 by 11 room  And actually  When I told the cop  To take the cuffs off  And the cop said  Pat you don't want  To take the cuffs off  This guy  Because I fought with him  And he's no pussy  And I said  I said to him  If we take the cuffs off  If you promise  You'd behave  And I'll get you  A coffee and cigarettes  And we can relax  And he just shook his head  But the first words  He said after 
[02:57:00]  They took the cuffs off  The cop said  I'll be right outside  The door Pat  As soon as he closed  The door  He said  You're not going to  Let him hit me anymore  Oh wow  He really didn't want  To get hit anymore  So I was the old  Good guy bad guy  From the beginning  So I decided  To be the good guy  But you never had  To take the cuffs off  Because you were  6, 7 guys  So you weren't  Worried about him  Yeah I wasn't  Really worried about him  But you never know  I've never  I never interrogated  A guy with cuffs on  It's just not a good  He didn't want  To fuck up his suit  Comfortable  So you take the cuffs off 
[02:57:30]  And you sit with him  Yeah then I  Introduced myself to him  And I said  I'm the one  Who's going to be  Dealing with you on this  I said  But before we get started  Do you smoke  Or would you like  A cup of coffee  And he looked up  And he said  Yeah I'd like both  So I went  Got one and came back  And when I asked him  About the head  In the refrigerator  He said  I don't feel  It's in my best interest  To talk about that  So I said  Well we don't have  To talk about it  We can talk about other things  How about the  Leon Perrin  Why don't we start there  And we'll work our way  Up to the head  No he was very 
[02:58:00]  He said  What's going to happen  To me if I don't talk to you  So I kind of explained  To him the booking process  And he seemed to understand  Because he had been  Arrested before  For lewd and lascivious  And but then he asked me  Can I get my own cell  And I knew then  That he knew about the bullpen  And if you know about any bullpen  It's just a shithole  Where you know  Everybody and their brothers  In there  It's disgusting  And he didn't want to go there  So I could pick up  On that right away  I said  No it's a Friday night  And the bullpen  There you go  I said  There's no way  You're going to get  A single cell 
[02:58:30]  A little leverage  I said  If you stay here with me  We can talk about  And we did talk about  Things for about  Three and a half hours  Before he crapped out to me  So  What stuff did you talk about  That had nothing to do with  Well I picked up  That he was an alcoholic  And I myself  Like most coppers  Suffer from old  John Barleycorn  And I had my own  Battles with it  So I was knowledgeable  About AA  I kind of  Twelve stepped him  But we talked for about  An hour about religion  He grew up in a very  Strong Lutheran  Religious family  We talked about  Homosexuality  We talked about  Whether there was  A god or not 
[02:59:00]  We talked  He loved his family  Especially his grandmother  So for about  Three and a  And to tell you the truth  If you talk to most  Homicide detectives  The typical homicide  Confession  Takes about  Three and a half hours  Before they start  To get into that  Defeated position  To tell you what happened  So it was great  About that  But every time  When he finally did  He said  If I tell you  You'll be famous  I said oh come on man  I've seen a bunch of shit  Before  It's not going to be anything  And then he said 
[02:59:30]  But if I do tell you  You'll hate me  And you won't want  To talk to me anymore  I said no no  I'll stick with you  So he goes  Well if I am going  To tell you  I'm going to start  At the beginning  And he told me  About his first homicide  Back in Bath, Ohio  When he was 18  13 years ago  Right  So I put my pen down  I'm listening to him  And then he  Talked about going  To the army  In Ohio  And getting kicked out  And then moving here  To Graham  Is where he started  Killing again  And when he got  To about his second  Or third  I said well  Take a break  I want to get  Some more coffee  And the lieutenant  Came out to me  And said  Is he talking 
[03:00:00]  And I said  Well yeah  He's talking  But I said  I don't think  He's going to help us  I said  He's told me  He's killed like  Five or six people  And he hasn't even  Told me about  The guy in the refrigerator  I said  I think he's a bullshitter  And he goes  No no no  Your partner called  They found 11 heads  And they got penises  So I went back in  I took my pen  I was like  Okay let's start over again  Let's start from the beginning  It's important to say  When you were talking  To him at that point  You just thought  There was the one head  In the refrigerator  I'm waiting to find out 
[03:00:30]  About this head I saw  And he's telling me  About somebody  He killed 13 years ago  And two years ago  And it turned out  To be another  Four or five  Before we finally  Got to the head  I went back in  With a whole new attitude  About the interrogation  No shit  Wow  And did you  Did you find yourself  Liking him at all  I'm sure it's different  To actually talk to somebody  Than it is to hear about them  Well like I said  In the movie to Chris  Who really got a lot out of me  I'm talking more about it now  But 20 years ago  I wouldn't have liked this  Right  When you spend 
[03:01:00]  Six weeks with somebody  10-12 hours a day  You have breakfast with them  Lunch with them  Yeah  I form  Detectives are trained  To build rapport  To form a relationship  But  Yeah  I kind of  He was a pathetic fuck  Okay  He could not  He couldn't make  An emotional connection  With anybody  I even asked him  One time  I said  Why don't you  Just get a boyfriend  Why did you  Have to kill everybody  And to me  He was just this  Really pathetic 
[03:01:30]  Human being  Who on the other side  Had this obsession  With this  This constant pursuit  Of this hedonistic  Pleasurable lifestyle  Where  He lived in an area  All of his money  Went towards alcohol  And the pursuit  Of pleasure sexually  And his drugs  I mean that was  His whole  Wow  Reason for living  So he was a very  And as a lover  The people that we talked  He was a very selfish lover  I mean he was a giver  Not a taker  And  A giver  Not a taker  Selfish or selfless 
[03:02:00]  Selfish lover  If you're homosexual  And you're selfish  You're giving  Oh okay  You got it with the hand motion  You're the train  You're the train  Not the tunnel  Oh okay  I gotta ask you  Because obviously  We're running out of time  But I gotta ask you  Based on what you just said  About building a rapport  And everything  How did you feel  When he was killed  Everybody asks that  And to tell you the truth  I'm kind of embarrassed  To admit it  But I felt really shitty  About it  To tell you the truth  I'm a Catholic  And I'm against  Capital punishment 
[03:02:30]  And I felt sorry  For the guy  I mean he was  Such a pathetic individual  And like I told Chris  In his movie  I felt bad  That I felt bad  For him  I mean it made me  What I remember thinking  Right  What is there about me  That connected with this freak  Right  That I feel so bad about  You gotta make a question  Yourself  How did you hear it  Somebody called you  Are you in the news  Yeah I walked into  By that time  I had been day shift  Actually the Dahmer thing  Kind of helped my career  A little bit  I finally got off  The late shift 
[03:03:00]  And got to the day shift  And the captain  Called me over  He was on the phone  With the correctional facility  When he was murdered  They called right down  Right away  So I walked in  It was the same thing  I walked in  I took my coat off  He goes  Hey Kennedy  They killed your boy  Your boy  And I said  What are you talking about  And I got on the phone  With the guy there  And told me what happened  How long had it been  Since you had any contact  With him  Since the professional aspect  Of it  The questioning  And everything  The last time I talked to him  Was when he was sentenced  To 956 years in prison 
[03:03:30]  And I shook his hand  As he went off  To jail  And that was him  And he had requested  To talk to me  A couple of times  But I didn't really want to  Anymore  Okay  Yeah yeah yeah  And what happened was  My partner  Dennis Murphy  Went up to the  Correctional institution  Where he was at  For another homicide  You know people in jail  Are always saying  We'll give you some information  If you can get me out  So he was up there  Talking to somebody  And he went to visit Jeff  And he told me that  Jeff had put on  35 pounds  And had gone from 
[03:04:00]  A very straight acting  Male  Gay male  To a stereotypical  Almost flamboyant one  Wow  And told him  That he is requested  To get out of segregation  Because for the  Three and a half years  He was there  They kept him in a  Nine by twelve  Windowless cell  Twenty three hours a day  And only one hour a day  He was put like  In a room where  It was open to the sky  So you could see  The fresh air  By himself  And he told Dennis  He goes  I'm going crazy here  I can't take it  You know  Just to be locked  Like with no communication 
[03:04:30]  And he even said  I know that when I get  Put in the general population  They'll kill me  And it was within  Three months  That he was put  In the general population  That he was murdered  No kidding  But it really upset you  When he was killed  Well I don't like to say  I'm upset like  I'm some kind of a  No no no  I love this guy  But you talk about  The documentary  It was really interesting  Yeah  I was supposed to go  To class that night  Because I was going on  To get my graduate degree  Because I wanted to get  Out of the police department  And I was frying  Being a homicide detective  And I turned around 
[03:05:00]  And went back home  And went to my little apartment  And just sat there by myself  And I don't know  It was another one of those things  Where I felt bad  About feeling bad  No shit yeah  No one thinks you're a pussy  You're a 6'7 homicide detective  No one's mistaken  There's nothing worse than a 6'7  Pussy homicide detective  What was your first inkling  That this was a massive case  Oh when I saw the head  Yeah but I mean  There's been other  But where you realize  Holy fuck  This is going to be  An international story  That's what I mean  No I really didn't think 
[03:05:30]  It would be an international  So I was surprised  The next day  When I came into work  And there was literally  A media circus  Right  So I knew instinctively  That you didn't want  To fuck this case up  Right  You had to do it right  So yeah  And I was young  I was energetic  It was exciting  It was a good time  You know when you're  In your 30's  And you're doing  What you've been trying to do  So I can honestly say  For those 6 weeks  I poured everything  That's a career case  Right there  Yeah it was 
[03:06:00]  I knew it would make  Or break  Did you chase that high  Afterwards  Like another case  That was high profile  What was the second case  We found a finger  In a garage  Yeah  I can tell you  That during this time  Anybody that  You know  Every we got reports  All the time  There's bones over here  And I mean  They're always  You know ribs  Rib bones  And chicken bones  And you know  They didn't check it all out  That was it for you though  You knew that was going to be it  The day that he got sent  To jail  The next day  I got put to the late shift 
[03:06:30]  And that night  I got another homicide  So I mean  It was a very busy year  For us that year  Wow  So I really didn't have time  To think about it  Or process it  I just went back to work  I'm trying my interruption  They're telling us  You have to go  Because you have press  It's your guys  I want to properly promote this  Absolutely  I have one more question  You should talk to the guy  Who made this film man  We'll watch the film  The film is really good  I'm sure he's  You know  It was really  But this is fascinating  You were there  It's called  The Jeffrey Dahmer Files  It opens February the 15th  We'll of course Twitter it 
[03:07:00]  Select theatrical beginning  Is at the IFC Center  Here in New York  Cable video on demand platforms  You can grab it on Comcast  Cox  Cable vision  Time Warner  Satellite TV  DirecTV  iTunes  Xbox  Sundance  Now dot com  And go to  Jeff  The movie  Dot com  It's fascinating  And you can tell by listening  To this  We literally had  We would have sat here  With you until fucking  11 o'clock  We want to talk  To the detective  He's telling interesting stories  I want to hear what  That fucking F stop  Of the camera was  I have one more  It was really exciting 
[03:07:30]  I have one question for Pat  There was one  One particular  Patrick  Whatever you prefer  There was one  One thing  A guy escaped  A boy escaped  Dahmer's apartment  Went to two cops  They didn't know  What was happening  They sent this kid back  And Dahmer murdered him  Immediately  It was obviously  A tremendous mistake  Did you know the cops  Did that happen to  Yes and actually  In the middle of the interrogation  When he told me  About this one  I said time out  Are you trying to tell me  That two Milwaukee police officers  Walked this kid back there  So I took a break 
[03:08:00]  I went and told  Well I didn't talk  To any bosses right away  I went and got on the phone  To the 3rd district  And I said  Did you have  Could you check back to July  Because he was uncanny  About dates  Oh really  Uncanny  Like most serial killers are  I can  But they said  Yeah  A squad got sent  To check for a naked Asian male  Off 25th and State  I said  Find out who those guys are  They told me  And I said  Wake them up  And tell them to get down here  Within a half hour  They were there  And I told them 
[03:08:30]  And they were both  Like just  Crested far  Pretty much  Sent a man  To his death  Well it's  We know it's  More time to talk about it  But  And these were good  Good men  I mean  Both of them  I saw them  Put their life on the line  One guy was in a shootout  With a guy who killed a cop  I mean  These were courageous  Young Christian males  I would think  They would say  But  In the situation  That they got in  When  They were surrounded  By a people of color  The only other person  That they really 
[03:09:00]  Believed  Was the other white male  And  That's what I teach now  In college  It's a thing called  The police complex  That anybody can get  And  Like I say  It's a lot longer  To get into it  And I hate to leave it  Like this  Because these are two  Fine gentlemen  But did they make a mistake?  Oh hell yeah  They made a hell of a mistake  You know what the odd thing is though  If  Perhaps  Those officers in the car  Would have had the proper  Handcuff key  That would have gone away  Again  He would have gone away again 
[03:09:30]  Because this guy did not want  He was embarrassing  Yes  He did not want to press charges  So it's another case  That might have just  Ended up with more dead people  There's at least  Six or seven pivotal times  Throughout his murderous career  Where authority figures  Had him  And he was able to fool them  I'm talking about  Public psychologists  Probation parole officers  Judges  The building superintendent  And his own father  Wow  Who saw the bones  Of dead people  And believed  What Jeff told him  That they were the bones  Of a dog  That he had found 
[03:10:00]  This is fascinating  I am seeing it  Amazing  Your interview was so good  Thank you for coming too  Wherever you are  But no  It's hard to top the detective  Who talked to Dahmer  I mean  The film was well done  I'll say that  It was excellent  And it kept me  From the beginning to the end  I'm always looking for great  Video on demand stuff  And this is  JeffTheMovie.com  To get all the information  You need  And just a genuine  Can I make a shameless plug  Sure  Absolutely  Because I worked with Chris  He's the one who told me 
[03:10:30]  You ought to write a book  About what happened  So over the last year  I just completed  A book that starts  With the day  I find the head  In the refrigerator  And ends the day  I shake his hand  Wow  And kind of tells  What happened to me  Personally  I mean I ended up  Getting a divorce  Out of the deal  Wow  It's called  More than a head  So I'm actually  Looking for a publisher  Someone to take a look  At it  Yeah  Oh man  Who wouldn't pick that up  In a second  It's fantastic  You're unknown  And everybody's got a book  They say  And you really believe  You got divorced 
[03:11:00]  Because of Jeffrey Dahmer  Oh no  I mean divorce  That was a big thing  My wife was  The day it came  I did get home  For like 24 hours  And when I got home  She was sitting  We were having problems anyway  But that was the straw  That broke the camel's back  So at the end of it  You say special thanks  To Jeffrey Dahmer  Would you explain in detail  To other people  About this case  Oh yeah  I've done it many times  I mean during the case  Oh no  We're under a gag order  We're not allowed to talk  So even your wife  You wouldn't be like  So the fucking head over here  She didn't want to talk about it 
[03:11:30]  Oh she didn't  She didn't  She didn't want to talk about it  With the kids  Right right  She was taking the kids  Out of the house  For the six weeks  I was alone quite a bit  Oh man  You know  Homicide detectives alone  Just not a good thing  You watch First 48?  No I can't watch any of that  Yeah  I just can't  I watch it  And it's like  Why do these guys talk  You could tell  The cops are pissed off  When they lawyer up  So do what pisses the cops off  No matter how much  Lawyering up you do  Black skull in the refrigerator  Does not get explained away  Trump  Throw that shit every time  We gotta get them  We gotta get them  Thanks so much

[03:15:00]  He had to like  Open the mouth  You think Dahmer  Opened the mouth  Up to get the blowjob  Yeah he probably  Had it in his bed  For a couple days  Talking to it  Hey what's up man  Making the mouth move  And everything  Why'd you do that  Why'd you kill me  He was doing a racist  Black accent  He was doing Django  Why you do that to me Jeff  What your problem dog  I like chocolate  We could've went to  Your chocolate factory  And had chocolate  And been friends  Suck each other dick  Friends  Suck each other dick  Every once in a while  You had to come

[03:16:30]  I kept one sticker on  For Who Kid  Check it out son  That's hood right there  I like that  I gotta tell you  That you know  We always talk about  Black history month  I'm sorry  Not yet  Not till tomorrow  Who Kid  You do not get this day  I'm sorry  But I always talk about  How management never  He doesn't get today  Today is still ours  You know what  Today is ours  Today is ours  Until 12 o'clock tonight  This is our day  Let's go eat corn  Eat their white people  Let's go have some mayonnaise sandwiches  Don't talk to us like that  Who Kid  Sorry sorry  How dare you  Take that bass out of your voice  What do you think 
[03:17:00]  Dama would do with Who Kid  Oh he would love  Who Kid  Oh my god  I guarantee  He wouldn't kill him  He would have kept him  You know how Jeffrey Dahmer  I guess  Oh Dahmer  Yeah Jeffrey Dahmer  We had the detective  Who did his case in  I saw a movie  And it said  And you know  The detective would probably  Know better than me  But it said  That he was trying  To make sex zombies  What  And so he would  Drill their heads in  With an electric drill  Right  And at first  He didn't want to kill them  He just wanted to make 
[03:17:30]  Them his zombies  So they would never leave  Yeah and they wouldn't scream  And he could just sit there  And he could suck them off  But he didn't realize  So every time he killed them  Then he would behead them  And do the head puppet thing  Right  That we discussed  Yeah  Who Kid  Who Kid would be like  Who Kid  Who Kid  He'll definitely  He'll definitely eat my dick though  I'll tell you that  You think so  Would it take him a while  You do  It's like a week meal  Kielbasa  Meal for a week  You know what I'm saying  It's a German meal  But I want to know 
[03:18:00]  Did he eat the dicks  No he ate it  So he ate the dicks  He loved those dicks  There's a lot of meat  Especially in Who Kid  He ate dicks  Ass  He can't eat an ass  How could you eat an ass  He ate the cheek  Not the asshole  Like a fucking calamari  No he did say  He had a lot of black ass  He ate it like an onion ring  Yeah he would love Who Kid  But that's what I was getting at  With Sal  I know  And he just cuts the show off  As Opie says  Alright that was great guys  Opie and Anthony  And Opie is just yelling  I think he turned the mics back on

[03:27:30]  Jess comes home  And like she's like  Oh I got this new product  That might work  Work on your neck  And look at the box  And there's a white guy on it  Take it back  I'm not even gonna try it  Take it back  Yeah  You know which aisle to go in  Yeah  It's right now  Anything  It's gotta be a black guy on the box  Yeah  It's gotta be  It's gotta be in the same aisle  With cocoa butter  Yeah  Yeah  Your pharmacy has to sell cereal  Snakers  And  And pharmaceutical goods  Like sundries  Exactly  Sundries  Yeah  You need a ghetto pharmacy  You gotta use vinegar 
[03:28:00]  Like Samuel L. Jackson  Told me to put vinegar on my shit  Is that what you use  Vinegar  Just straight vinegar  Olive oil  You gotta mix it together  Vinegar and olive oil  Don't do that  They'll wipe the liquid too  Cause you can't really wipe it off  Oh she has to lick it off  You have to lick that shit off  Oh okay  Okay  Don't do that  Let me do runner up  Don't do that  Let me do the first runner up line of the day  What is it  Hit the button  Hit the button  I wonder if his boyfriend turns him on  And he's saying  Eat my cum pile  That was just gross  Alright 
[03:28:30]  Runner up too  She liked when he went down  On that big  Fucking hairy muff  And played like the bugle  Yeah he'd blow her queefs  Out through her nose  That was the  What is the pointer  What is her name  Andrews sisters  The Andrews sisters  The last one died  The last one died yesterday  Who can  Bugle Boy Company B  That's their song  That's their jam  Died yesterday  Died yesterday  Ninety-four  Yeah but who gives a shit  She's ninety-four  What do you expect  That's a great retort  Bob Kelly  Line of the day 
[03:29:00]  She's ninety-four  Yeah good  It was time  She should have died  Ten years ago  Yeah  Eighty-four  Is a good death year  Eighty-four  Is a great death year  Da bitch  Da  Yeah but that's white people  Hip-hop years  I mean  They're probably forty-eight  How great is fifty  Twenty-one  How great are fifty cents  Tweets on this Rick Ross thing  Did you hear about Rick Ross  Getting shot up  He got shot  Well no  His car got shot up  A whole bunch of times  Yeah  And then he drove into a building  Because it's like 
[03:29:30]  Literally dozens of times  Fifty cent puts out a tweet  That says  Somebody asked him  So did officer Ricky  Because that's what he calls him  I know  He used to be a correctional officer  Let me  Can I just say before you  I love the feud between  Fifty cent and Rick Ross  Oh yeah  It's like  One of my favorite things  In the hip-hop world  When he took  When he flew in  Rick Ross' woman  Baby mom  Baby mom  Flew in and bought her  A fucking fur coat  And shoes  And a pocketbook  It was the most insulting thing  But you know he took it back  What?  He took it back  He took that fucking fur coat back 
[03:30:00]  No he didn't  He said bitch  Get back to the fucking life  But that's because  Rick Ross had a great comeback  Which was  I said  I asked him in an interview  I said  Did it hurt your feelings Rick Ross  That fifty cent  Bought your baby mom clothes  And he said  No  Because that's what a boss does  Wow  Meaning he's such a boss  Fifty cent buys his baby mom clothes  That's not a good retort  Maybe not  No  But  So he gets shot a whole bunch of times  Somebody tweets fifty cent that says  Did officer Ricky get shot 
[03:30:30]  And fifty cent goes  No  Some guy shot up in the air twelve times  And Ricky drove into a building  He said the whole thing was faked  I don't know  It's so weird  I don't know why  Who's trying to kill Rick Ross?  Why?  Well what about those gangster disciples?  They put out the YouTube video  And everything  But they don't live in Miami  I don't understand  Who's trying to kill this guy?  Yeah  Maybe he's not paying gangs  You said rappers have to pay gangs off for protection  Against the gangs themselves  Maybe it's a McDonald gangsters  I don't know  He's only old for burgers  Is that true? 
[03:31:00]  You have to pay rappers  Not you  Yeah  Not me  Rappers do pay for protection  Right  Against the people they're paying  And rumors has it  Quote unquote  You know  Maybe maybe not  Biggie got killed  Because he didn't pay for protection  Is that the rumor?  That was one of the rumors  Wow  You know  But whatever  Well we know it wasn't Tupac  Nah  It wasn't him  It came back from the grave  I don't know  Alright  You know  Like they did that thing with Tupac  The  Hologram  The hologram  Yeah  How much money would it cost 
[03:31:30]  To do biggies  Oh my god  An extra four million  Yeah  To have that fucking moose  Walking  How many light beams  Does it take?  That's a lot of area to fill  That's a lot of  Oh my god  Can you imagine?  Don't disrespect the legend though  Right now  But today we can't  Tomorrow we can't  Tomorrow we can't  No  Tomorrow  Nigga history  Well I'm not going to say that  I won't say it  You can say the beginning of it  N word history  Ah shit  Alright  Last runner up  And then we get to the line of date
