<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a highly offensive and profane discussion of Game 6 of the 2004 ALCS between the Yankees and Red Sox.  The hosts dissect the game, focusing on controversial calls, the Yankees' poor performance, and the Red Sox's victory, peppering their commentary with racial slurs and homophobic remarks.  They also rant about Yankee and Red Sox fans, umpires (particularly mocking their perceived incompetence), George Steinbrenner's aging, and Kurt Schilling's pitching performance, all while employing extremely vulgar language. A caller recounts a sexually explicit experience at a massage parlor, leading to technical difficulties.  The segment features numerous tangents, including fictional stories, crude jokes, and an announcement regarding an upcoming XM Satellite Radio development. The show concludes this segment with a bit called "Fag Talk," using the word "fag" repeatedly and suggestively.

Next, Spoonie Love places a phone call to a flower shop, ordering roses and a card with a highly offensive message for his girlfriend. The florist refuses to write the requested message.  This transitions into "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" (or "Whenever"), with discussions about listener participation and a backlog of "WOW" sticker orders.  The hosts then speculate about the New Jersey governor's wife's potential STD exposure due to her husband's alleged homosexuality, launching into vulgar jokes.  Further technical difficulties ensue, with the hosts yelling into the microphone.  A listener calls them "retarded." The segment continues with discussions of sponsorships, Paris Hilton's alleged use of racial slurs, and Opie's aggressive and offensive driving habits, including instances of reckless driving and vehicle abandonment.  The hosts mention technical difficulties and their relationship with XM,  a planned game called "Coming or Going,"  the challenges of reinventing their show for XM, the abundance of their old content online, an upcoming *Happy Days* reunion, and a dark storyline in a *Brady Bunch* reunion.  They mention an offensive song about AIDS from *Team America*.  After resolving technical issues, they continue with off-color humor, "hot teen news," and a George W. Bush remix of U2's "Sunday Bloody Sunday." The show ends this segment with a discussion of their agent, Bob, and their reluctance to attend dinner.

The following segment focuses on the hosts' financial anxieties, their agent's meticulousness, their reluctance to plan for retirement (preferring PartyPoker), a poor investment in a stock IPO, and their wills (or lack thereof). Opie expresses a desire for family conflict over his inheritance.  They criticize a CEO reality show, discuss their fear of heights (sparked by a story about a man climbing a building), recount a prank on a colleague, and discuss workplace ladder accidents, including a near-fatal fall.  They discuss items on eBay, including "artistic interpretations" of Opie's underwear and a raincoat from a "Monster Rain" segment, and recordings of confessions from former colleagues.  They discuss their preferred strip clubs. A caller, Brad, compliments the show and Jimmy Norton's Susquehanna Hat Company. A discussion about a school bus accident follows, leading into a discussion of the delayed release of *Half-Life 2* due to code theft. The longest segment involves a sexually explicit phone call with Karen and her husband from Illinois, culminating in sounds of oral sex.  This sparks a "sexiest state" competition between Tennessee and Illinois, won by Illinois. The segment ends with a James Taylor rendition of a DMX song, listener calls, and discussion of upcoming segments.

A segment featuring a phone call with Karen and her daughter Cassie ensues.  The hosts joke about overhearing Karen and her husband having sex and engage them in increasingly suggestive conversations.  They play "Guess What's in My Pants," instructing Karen to rub the phone against her genitals. They discuss their return to satellite radio, previous controversies, and their precarious position. Listeners call in, one arguing about satellite radio costs. A promotional segment for a live show airs.  Topics include Walmart banning a Jon Stewart book, trick-or-treating bans, and a conspiracy theory involving Howard Stern and George W. Bush.  Anthony's "Hot Teen News" features news items about underage sex, drug use, and risky teen behavior. The Iron Sheik and Eric Logan (head of programming for XM) make brief appearances; Logan announces XM's acquisition of Major League Baseball broadcast rights.

The final segment features Eric Logan in studio announcing the XM Satellite Radio and Major League Baseball deal.  He discusses the partnership's potential for increased access to baseball players and synergistic opportunities.  The timing of the announcement, coinciding with a Red Sox-Yankees game, is noted. Tangents include an awkward call to Don Messner (voice of Scooby Doo), crude jokes about married life, and listener phone-ins with "What did you learn today?" responses. The show ends abruptly with a pre-recorded comedic bit involving a drill and further crude humor and sexually suggestive banter.

[00:06:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Thanks for checking us out.  A little bit.  We're on XM.  We'll be right back. 
[00:06:30]  We're on XM.  We're on XM Satellite Radio, the greatest satellite radio company in the world.  No one comes second.  We're close.  We're close.  No one even comes second.  You've got to be close to be seconds.  One big tie for first.  Oh, could you stop with all the replays, please, on the news?  Ha, ha, how you doing?  Ha, ha, how you doing?  I love those little coffee-clotch umpire meetings they had last night.  All getting together like a few men just to discuss a call and turn it the right way. 
[00:07:00]  I don't like the fact that A-Rod can't smack a ball out of a mid if he's so inclined.  Yeah, I know.  Why not?  He's running down the baseline.  Yeah.  You've got a dope in front of you blocking the bag.  You've got a pitcher coming at you with the ball.  Why can't you, you know, flail your arms a little bit?  Just say it.  A wigger.  That's what a royal is.  A wigger.  He's a white guy with little cornrows.  Yo, what up, cuz?  All right.  Get the ball out of your hand, wigger.  And it fell and it rolled in the right field.  Right. 
[00:07:30]  It, you know, it was a good call, though, there.  And the ump called him safe even before he hit the bag.  I mean, come on.  Why not?  In the old days, that used to stand.  The ump made a decision.  That was it.  That's right.  That fat bastard wouldn't change it for nobody.  Now they have a little conference.  They chat with each other.  And they make a decision.  And they make the right decision.  Joe Torre comes running out.  Yeah.  He had to.  Showing almost some emotion.  Yeah.  But you know what?  We go to game seven, boys. 
[00:08:00]  Yes, yes, we do.  We go to game seven.  You know why?  Because it's a Yankee-Sox series.  And it just always happens this way.  Everyone, all the Yankee fans, including me, expected the sweep after they took three.  And then it was like, all right, yeah, let them take one.  It's kind of cute.  And now, all of a sudden, bam, here we are.  Game seven.  Game seven. 
[00:08:30]  Yankees not looking good.  The Yankees look like that truck on the highway that you're behind.  Yeah.  You're smoking really bad.  And you look close.  And the tire's really wobbly.  And there you see the exit sign.  And you're not sure if the truck's going to make it to the exit.  Yeah.  That's what the Yankees are looking like right now.  The wheels are starting to fall off your team, pal.  Well, who knew old Kotex ankle was going to come in and actually be able to pitch?  I knew.  I told you.  Kurt Schilling all the way.  And he didn't need his high tops after all now, did he? 
[00:09:00]  Old chop meat heel comes in the game and he does a bang-up job.  Wait until those drugs wear off this morning.  He's going to realize he just wrecked his career.  You watched a career-ending round of pitching.  His ankle looked like a head in this bomb's mouth.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  4-2.  Sox victory over the Yankees last night.  Front page of the Boston Herald, seventh heaven.  Shut up.  And what is the post saying?  The post has a big picture of the Bambino there with, put me in. 
[00:09:30]  Put me in, coach.  I'm ready.  You can't.  He's dead.  He's dead.  And the maggots are eating away the remaining tissue of his body.  It's done.  It's only going to hurt more tonight.  Well, that's the Yankee fans.  That's what we're holding on to.  Is the fact that if the Yankees now win in the seventh game,  the disappointment will be so devastating that it will have been worth  losing the past three games. 
[00:10:00]  But, you know, you can't take anything away from the Sox.  They come back after dropping three games, and they take three.  It's amazing.  It's amazing.  I don't know what happened to the Yankee bats.  They can't capitalize, and they get people on base, and that's a problem.  What was up with all the cops?  Oh, there seems to be a problem.  The Yankee fans didn't like a couple of the calls,  and they fired down some debris onto the field. 
[00:10:30]  I know what the reason was, but yesterday morning you were talking about the Red Sox fans.  Yeah, yeah.  The Yankee fans are out of control, too.  I just say that Red Sox fans look like a bunch of tools.  Why does the NYPD have to bring everyone up to Yankee Stadium for these games  when there's crime happening all over the city of New York?  Well, they put some riot police out on the field.  There used to be a time where a couple guys want a little overtime.  You bring them up to Yankee Stadium, and they come walking out with their guns and stuff 
[00:11:00]  near the end of the game and kind of stand out on the field.  Now there's like hundreds of NYPD guys up there for the games.  Well, they put them just outside the foul line for when the Sox were up,  and then when the Yankees got up to bat, they took them off the field.  Stop ruining our fun.  I like the old days when, you know, let's say the Yankees clinched last night.  Let the fans get on the field, man.  Oh, let them get on the field and tear it up.  I used to love that crap, man.  It's amazing what they used to let the fans do.  They used to love that. 
[00:11:30]  Go ahead.  You'd run out on the field and rip up the grass and the mound and take the bases.  They used to let you take your seat home back in the day.  Back in the old days.  People would show up at the game with little, like, mayonnaise jars  because they want a piece of the field.  Yeah.  Remember, they would come out and they would rip up the dirt and stuff from the mound,  put it in their little mayonnaise jar so they could show their friends for the next 20 years.  Now you'd be shot and wrestled to the ground and taken off the field.  Wade Boggs pretty much punches an NYPD cop to take over his horse and ride around the outfield. 
[00:12:00]  He's riding around the field on a horse.  Those were the good old days, man.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That father and son ruined it for everyone.  What was that?  In Cleveland or wherever?  Oh, jumping out and beating the crap out of it.  Yeah.  Beating the hell out of the first base coach.  Yeah.  Well, no.  They started, like, taking control of that a while ago.  I don't know when, but barbarian Yankee fans last night throwing stuff in the field.  They were a little upset with a couple of the calls.  Oh, come on.  The A-Rod call was totally legit.  A-Rod, I believe, was just running to first base.  He was running arms.  Flailing his arms a little bit. 
[00:12:30]  The umpires were stoned or something to see that that first home run by Bellhorn,  that was totally a home run, and they're trying to say that.  I think it hit the wall.  It did.  It was two feet over the wall.  I saw the replay.  I still think it hit that wall.  And if the wind takes it, it doesn't count anyway.  Yeah.  It was so bad.  They were just firing debris down on the field, and they had to bring the riot police out.  And how do they put the cops on the field like that?  The cops are in play at that point.  I don't understand.  It was that big, did you see the big pumpkin-headed head cop guy that came out? 
[00:13:00]  The guy in charge, he's pointing everywhere, and his little cop hat could barely fit on  top of that huge pumpkin-like head.  And he was making the decision, I want riot cops out on this field.  Get them out.  Both baselines.  Well, because the umpires just faggots.  Hey, there's 50,000 people throwing batteries at us.  Did you get somebody out here?  Ah, you pussy.  Used to be big, thick Coke bottles flying down on the field.  They had to take it.  They're wearing the equipment.  Ever since that guy grabbed his chest and spoiled opening day in Cincinnati a few years ago. 
[00:13:30]  The umpires are all of a sudden sensitive.  Now they're a little sensitive.  Yeah, and I noticed they learned their lesson.  They're all nice and fit.  Yeah, I know.  They really are.  They're fatter than ever.  You know, getting back to destroying the field, I just remember something.  When I was living in Buffalo, and the Bills had their nice run of losing four Super Bowls  in a row.  Yep.  But, you know, they would win the AFC Championship, right?  I was at one of these games when they won the AFC Championship, and the fans come on the 
[00:14:00]  field like they used to do, okay?  They ripped the goalposts out of the ground.  Oh, yeah.  Animals.  Have you ever seen this video?  They ripped it out, and like little ants carrying like a grasshopper.  That's the only way I can explain it.  They lifted the goalposts all the way up to the top of the stadium and hoisted it over  the top of the stadium like ants.  And threw it over.  Threw it over, and now it's on the other side, and people are trying to rip it apart.  They were able to rip it into like three sections. 
[00:14:30]  The huge goalposts.  Animals.  And then they're walking down the road back, you know, to their cars and stuff with the  goalposts as you're leaving the stadium.  And basically, it was like the last guy that was holding on was going to get to take this  thing home.  Unbelievable.  I'm sure there's pieces of it up in someone's apartment in Buffalo.  Not even that.  To this day, there's pieces of that goalpost in all the, you know, the gin mills around  the stadium.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  But, I mean, those were the good old days.  I mean, it started with a few guys just jumping on it and shaking it and stuff. 
[00:15:00]  And then they bring more guys up top until the weight collapsed the thing.  Not anymore, man.  You cannot even.  They kick people out now.  You've seen them go for the ball.  They go for a foul ball and they accidentally fall over onto the field.  They remove them from the stadium.  Yeah, even if it's accidental.  Accidentally.  You're on the field.  Get out.  Yeah.  Might even be arrested.  I'm still surprised nobody's fallen out of the green monster in Fenway.  Oh, that'll happen someday.  Some truck falls out. 
[00:15:30]  Sully.  Sully.  Oh, Sully.  Yeah.  All right, let's say O'Reilly or some patty will fall off of that thing.  Let's quickly go to the phones and say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Hey, Mike.  Hey, O&A.  How's it going?  Real good, man.  Hey, Long Potts.  So good to hear you guys again.  It's good to be back.  Isn't it, though?  What needs to be tonight must see television.  Fox needs to put a camera in Steinbrenner's box.  The meltdown cam.  You get to the seventh, eighth inning.  Oh, that's right.  Tonight's the game where we get to see him cry after the game. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, my God.  He will be taking his assistance and doing skeet shooting, launching him out of the box  and just boom.  No, you know something?  No.  Unfortunately, no.  It's not the George Steinbrenner of the old days.  Years ago, he was the tough guy.  He was the tough guy.  Remember?  Remember the old George Steinbrenner?  What a prick that guy was.  And he was tough and people were afraid of him.  Now, you see him on that commercial.  They keep playing over and over again where Joe Torre makes him sign the check and he's  got his arm in a cast. 
[00:16:30]  And he goes...  He starts signing and then he goes, oh, oh, oh, oh, like he's crying.  And he just looks like a doddering old buffoon now.  He used to look like, kind of like, you know, the tough business guy where you wouldn't screw  with him.  Not physically tough or anything, but you know in a boardroom or behind the scenes, if you  screwed him over or if you were a drunken Billy Martin, you know, he was going to lay  into you.  Now, he's just like, the Yankees are the best team in baseball and they're choking. 
[00:17:00]  It looks like he's going to cry.  He's got this constant little spittle drool on his lip now.  He's got the red eyes working.  All red eyes.  He's all like shake.  He's old man shake.  He's got going.  He's trying to sign that thing and he's just shaking.  I remember in the 70s, I was a tough guy.  Now, I ride around the stadium in a little rascal scooter.  He used to be the badass.  Now, who could be afraid of him? 
[00:17:30]  Little, little old man.  Ugh.  With liver spotted head and hands.  That time is a bitch.  It certainly is.  That time is a bitch.  You know, that's another reason you want to see the Yankees win, though, is for the locker  room.  When he comes out and he starts talking about the team, you know, this is.  One of the best teams in baseball.  And I've got to say, Joe Torre is one of the greatest fans.  Joe Torre. 
[00:18:00]  Honestly, I'm rooting for the Sox all the way.  Yeah.  But I wouldn't mind if the Yankees win because that is always a lot of fun to check out in  the locker room.  He used to be in the locker room and he'd be like, you know, this is the Yankee team that  always pulls it out.  It's amazing.  It's just what New York's all about.  It's what this team is all about.  We're so happy to have him.  And everybody, come here.  And I fully expected this and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  My team, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Now he just comes shaking in. 
[00:18:30]  You know, I got to say, I'm so proud of these kids.  You know, when you have people with such heart, like Derek C.  Like Derek C. 
[00:19:00]  Terry C.  And when we bring aboard someone like A-R-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-UH-U-U-H-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U-U.  It's so true.  Now we'd like to award the trophy.  What the hell happened to him?  What happened?  He's like whining, crying old fool.  Blubbering ass.  Blubbering buffoon.  I liked it better when he was sticking his boot up Martin's ass. 
[00:19:30]  Oh, please.  He'd punch out Billy Martin, no problem.  You know, Marietta Rivera, I just wanted to give control.  Hey, Jimmy, what's up?  Oh, hey, what's going on, boys?  You tell us.  Come on.  How about them socks for one?  How about them?  And I just want to pretty much say, no matter what happens tonight, the Yankees will always suck. 
[00:20:00]  Well, that's not very fair, sir.  That really isn't.  Well, you know, he's speaking the truth.  I'm rooting for the Yankees, but I'm kind of like a Sox fan, too.  So, you know.  I'm not a Sox fan, but you cannot be a Yankee fan and just go, yeah, well, the Sox blow.  See, you Sox fans are always Yankees suck.  They can win all the championships in the world.  They can kick the Sox ass year after year after year, but it's Yankees suck. 
[00:20:30]  I, as a Yankee fan, can look at what the Sox did over the past few games and go, wow, that's pretty impressive.  They pulled it together, and you've got to respect the team that does that.  But you Sox fans are such fucking pricks and ass wipes and so jealous.  Calm down.  Let's calm down.  No, I'm not going to calm down, because it's guys like this that ruin it.  We were having a nice discussion.  Calm down.  I'm talking about how the Sox come back.  They deserve the respect.  And then you get an idiot like this who's just like, Yankees suck. 
[00:21:00]  The battle chant of the idiot.  The battle chant of the buffoon of Boston.  Can I give the perfect scenario?  Yes, please.  The Sox beat the Yankees tonight, and then their plane crashes.  Oh, man.  That is harsh.  Oh, right into the drink.  Opie.  A little choking.  First of all, it isn't a choke.  A little choking going on.  It isn't a choke.  It isn't a choke.  So far, it's a choke.  I don't call it a choke.  So far, it's a choke. 
[00:21:30]  Dave, first of all, their pitching staff, everyone knows, it's thin to start with.  And then you got this, the devastation of the past few days, you know, they're spent.  And then for some reason, they can't capitalize, and they got people on base.  It's not a choke.  It's just the way it is.  All right.  Kevin, what's up?  Yo.  Yes?  Anthony.  Yes, my friend.  You're killing me.  Why?  Why, my friend?  The Sox are going to fucking kill him.  All right.  Well, you sound like you're still drinking from last night. 
[00:22:00]  Yankees fucking fans.  Yeah.  Well, it's just the way it is.  Well, we're here.  I don't know if you're there, though.  You're talking into the beer bottle instead of the phone.  I got to hang up on him.  Johnny in Cleveland.  Hey, what's up?  Let's go.  Let's go.  Wake up, people.  We got a radio show to do.  Yes.  You're part of this.  Come on.  It's time to get him.  Wake up.  They're a bunch of fucking mouth breathers.  I can't stand them calling them with their horrible accents.  You're an Indians fan?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, you know, our team sucks, too.  I mean, I ain't going to lie about that. 
[00:22:30]  But, God, I want to see that expression on their face of 50,000 horrible Red Sox fans  all going like their dog just got shot in the face.  Well, that would be good if they were playing Fenway tonight.  All right, listen, we're going to let the listeners have another cup of coffee and wake up.  One good thing, win or lose for the Sox, win or lose, you know Boston's just getting trashed  because these animals will be drunk and unruly and roaming the streets of Boston, throwing 
[00:23:00]  bottles through windows and turning over automobiles.  I love how you think the Yankee fans behave.  They don't behave.  They don't riot.  They don't.  But, yeah, they don't riot because they have nowhere to go after the game's over except  to get back into the crowd to get back to their cars.  They can't riot in the Bronx.  Are you insane?  They're outclassed.  The fans are completely outclassed.  They know how to riot in the Bronx.  You don't think the Bronx wants the Yankee fans to riot to make improvements in the neighborhood?  I see a bunch of Yankee fans trying to tip cars over and a bunch of the residents of 
[00:23:30]  the area showing them how it's done.  It's hard to tip cars off because they're all on cinder blocks.  They can't just flip them.  I was going to say they tip the cars back over as you're tipping it over.  Hey, I'm working in here, motherfucker.  There's three people living in there.  Spanish will be giving birth.  It's going to be a passenger seat.  It's going to be a great week for Boston sports fans because, see, tonight we're going  to win.  If you mention the Pats, I'll smash your teeth with that.  Let up go, Jets.  The Pats are going to beat the Jets on Sunday, Jim. 
[00:24:00]  Let's go, Jets.  Oh, boy.  That's an easy one.  I am taking bets on the Jets-Pats game.  Pat's going to win that one easily.  Well, put your money where your mouth is, bro.  I'm taking all sorts of bets for the Jets-Pats game this Sunday.  You know what I'm taking bets on?  Whether the guy who got us coffee is going to give me change.  I paid 20 bucks for a latte.  Oh, boy.  Can you tell Coke Habit intern to come in?  Evo, what's up?  Hey, man, you guys suck.  All right, let's go.  Come on.  Thank you.  It's good to have you back on the air. 
[00:24:30]  I'm listening on my XM radio that Anthony handed me when I went to DJ's to watch you,  Frick.  Oh, cool, man.  It's cool.  Hey, I got a friend of mine who works in Yankee Stadium.  Yeah.  Gave me a little insight.  Said that Steinbrenner's having a number three sewn on each one of the guys' sleeves  tonight as the psychological thing that they need for tonight.  Oh, God.  So fuck them all.  All right.  Thank you, Evo.  Yeah.  Good to see you.  Bye.  Bye.  Maybe we could bring the Zimmer back and we could mush him in the face and push him  to the field for luck.  Yeah.  That seemed to work, right? 
[00:25:00]  Where did he go?  He retired?  No.  Tampa.  Yeah, Tampa.  Pat, what's up?  Old bastard.  Hey, I got a perfect scenario for Jim.  What's that scenario, mister?  Hello?  I'm right here.  Let's go, Pat.  The Yankees win and they all go to a pool party at Mariano Rivera's house.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Thank you.  All right.  We're going to step aside.  There we go. 
[00:25:30]  So tonight's the night and, again, no sleep.  Thank you very much.  We're supposed to be done with this, eagerly awaiting the World Series  and getting some well-needed sleep.  But now, ah, what the hell?  You got to get up at 3.30 in the morning?  Ah, why not get to sleep at, like, 12.31?  And, you know, Game 7 tonight is going to take at least five hours.  Oh, of course.  Five and a half.  Extra innings.  Every pitch is that much more valuable.  Where's our miracle shwoogie in the ninth?  Come on.  We got that awful Tony Clark, and he looks like he's 28 with the hair of Ozzie Davis. 
[00:26:00]  And I wanted to smash his power.  He was terrified at the plate.  Did you see him all scared as he came up to the plate?  2-0.  A fastball goes down the middle, and he looks at it like, oh, Lordy.  Oh, he stinks.  And Posada, look, I like Posada.  He's trying to single-handedly lose this series.  Guy steals.  He throws the ball to Bernie.  Hey, stupid.  It's the second baseman, not the center fielder.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  Well, hopefully we pull it together tonight.  As long as nobody gets hurt.  I mean, that's the most important thing.  As long as they're having fun.  Right, Jim?  Good point, Ed.  Good point.  Tim from Phoenix.  I saw off my own ankle every time they talked about Schilling's ankle last night.  Oh, I know.  And showed it.  The blood spot getting bigger every inning wasn't fun either.  You can tell what inning it was by how dark the blood spot was getting.  It was just a nice purple colored, looked like the floor of a murder scene.  It was getting a little dry.  It was Kurt's time of the month.  Yeah. 
[00:27:00]  It was his time of the month.  He did pitch unbelievable, though.  He pitched a great game.  You got to give him a lot of credits.  Well, yeah, Mikey, you know you got to give him a lot of credit.  Hey, Schilling comes out there with a Kotex on his ankle and pitches a beautiful game.  Beautiful.  You spitting ass.  Another one I can't stand.  I like him, but to me, it's an unlistenable show because of Francesa.  Hey, dog.  Yeah, you're good. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, he's pitching on a bloody stump.  Pitching on a bloody stump.  He interrupts every time that stupid mad dog tries to talk.  That fat Francesa, that arrogant, perfect-haired Dago interrupts and makes me physically ill.  Well, every time he has to interrupt.  We drank-  Bad dog!  We drank his wine and smoked his cigars once.  Remember that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a fun night.  And he didn't know we were doing it.  That's what makes it better. 
[00:28:00]  We stole it.  All right.  Yeah, we're going to take a quick break.  We're going to come back.  We got Bruce on the line from PA.  Remember?  He was going to that massage parlor yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, did stupid fat Bob Kelly didn't call in?  Uh, I don't think so, no.  Creep.  He wants to call in today?  Well, he was going to it because he was a Sox fan.  If the Sox win, I'm calling in.  All right.  But we'll talk to Bruce next, see how his massage.  He was looking for the happy ending yesterday.  Remember?  He was married twice.  Oh.  So we'll get that update in just a bit here.  Can you say fuck on this channel? 
[00:28:30]  Oh, jeez.  My midget buddy wants to be a weatherman, but they'll never be a midget weatherman.  No one would believe them.  A flood is coming.  Yeah, to you.  What, did someone leave a faucet on or some shit?  We call my midget buddy Baby Shoes because he's got tiny little feet.  And he calls me Horse Cock Johnson because four inches is pretty big to a midget.  Oh, me and Baby Shoes, we do everything together except Seesaw because that really wouldn't 
[00:29:00]  be fair to him.  The other day, me and Baby Shoes, my midget buddy, we're hanging around my house thinking  of ways of turning my garage into a crystal meth lab.  You know, guy shit.  All of a sudden, he gets up off my bed, repels down the phone cord to the floor and goes,  Hey man, I gotta get going, I'm late.  Then he starts running and running. 
[00:29:30]  Have you ever seen a midget in a hurry?  Well, you'd know if you had because they don't slowly get smaller like you and me.  They just disappear right away.  And then there's a beautiful rainbow.  He was late for work.  For work.  If I was a midget man, I'd be constantly late.  I'd come in hours late.  My boss would be all pissed off.  Where were you?  Why were you late?  I'm trying to run a chocolate factory around here.  What's going on?  Hotel! 
[00:30:00]  I'd be like, why was I late?  Look at these little legs!  There was a puddle.  I had to swim it, fucker!  Oh my God, I'm sorry.  I thought I had a parrot on my shoulder.  Did you ever get that?  Nothing.  Nothing.  I wish I had a parrot.  I really do. 
[00:30:30]  And I wouldn't teach them dirty words or songs, no.  I would teach them phone numbers and addresses and recipes.  I'd use them more like a palm pilot, you know?  Or I'd teach them things that might save my life.  You know, like information.  Like, in case of an earthquake, get in the doorway!  Bah!  No one has freckles on their ass!  Use a condom!  Bah!  Bah!  Thank you, parrot. 
[00:31:00]  Here's a grape.  We played street football right there on the street.  And this is where we had the greatest quarterback in the world.  Our quarterback, he had to control 23 men on the side.  And he was really great at it.  You women don't know anything about it.  You played with dolls and stuff like that.  But here's a guy with an ingenious mind.  He'd call a football play like this. 
[00:31:30]  He'd always get down on one knee and draw things.  You know, he'd take a Coke bottle top.  Now, Shorty, this is you.  This is a Coke bottle top.  I don't want to be the Coke bottle top.  Okay, what do you want to be?  I want to be the piece of glass.  Okay.  Now, listen to this now.  Arnie, go down ten steps and cut left behind the black Chevy.  Filbert, you run down to my house and wait in the living room. 
[00:32:00]  Cosby, you go down to Third Street, catch the J bus.  Have him open the doors at 19th Street.  I'll fake it to you.  George had one fat kid.  He never thought.  What about me?  You go long.  Get a lot of good plays going like that.  I'll throw it over the water tower.  You'll catch it as it bounces off. 
[00:32:30]  How do you propose we get an entire nation to sit through a massive picture?  The OPNM Show.  Oh, Black Betty.  Bam, ba-lam.  Yeah, Black Betty.  Bam, ba-lam.  Black Betty at a job.  Bam, ba-lam.  Damn thing gone wild.  Bam, ba-lam.  She's always with it.  Bam, ba-lam.  She's on Rock City.  Bam, ba-lam.  Whoa, Black Betty. 
[00:33:00]  Bam, ba-lam.  Yeah, Black Betty.  Bam, ba-lam.  Boing, boing.  You're checking out the ONA virus spreading across America.  If you're doing your part, thank you very much.  Thank you.  This is the XM Nation, Anthony.  XM Nation.  We're part of the XM Nation.  It's growing every single day.  XM Nation.  You're spreading.  You just wait to see what XM Satellite Radio does next. 
[00:33:30]  Holy S.  Making a very, very, very, very smart business move.  Oh, yes, yes, but we can't talk about it.  Almost every single day.  It's only in the newspapers?  On Drudge.  Every news organization.  Every website.  CNN.  Well, there's going to be a big...  But we can't talk about it.  There's going to be a big press conference today.  Big announcement.  Talking about Major League Baseball.  What?  What?  Talking about what?  What?  Ooh. 
[00:34:00]  Oops.  How about that?  XM Satellite Radio knows how to spend their money the right way.  What are you saying?  That your deal is really, really stupid?  Not for me.  Ooh.  Not for you is right, but you're going to take down the whole company.  You know that, right?  And I'm giving half to Allison.  Allison.  Taking half my money.  But you don't care because it's all about you anyway, right?  That's right.  You idiot.  That's right, Opie.  He could have been here at XM Satellite Radio, but he thinks he's going to turn around that 
[00:34:30]  mess that is the little doggie.  The little doggie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because you're so much more important than the system itself, you idiot.  Let me calculate how many sea breezes I can get with that much money.  Oh, they got deals in the works.  I wish I could talk about it.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  You just sit back and watch what XM Satellite Radio does in the next few weeks.  What about that other thing?  You just watch.  What about that other thing?  That thing?  The thing.  Oh, yeah.  That thing's coming. 
[00:35:00]  You take care of that thing?  Yeah, that thing's coming.  Because I talked to the guy?  Yeah.  And I heard about the thing?  Yeah.  Oh, that's going to be big.  See, we're smart.  We could have went to the little doggie place.  We had our choice.  But unlike other people, we weren't stupid.  We weren't stupid.  Oh, look.  It's a mascot.  You want a pet?  You know, I don't know if we're allowed to say it, but the announcement is that they're  giving Kurt Schilling's ankle its own talk show on XM Radio. 
[00:35:30]  No, that's the type of thing that the little doggie place does.  Kurt Schilling's sock.  Kurt Schilling's sock, people.  Oh, imagine what that would get on eBay?  It's a one of a kind.  It's Kurt Schilling's bloodstained sack.  Bloodstained sock.  Bloodstained sock.  Be dialing, people.  Look at this thing.  It's even got some of his sweaty, stinky toe jam in the tip. 
[00:36:00]  Right in the tip.  And his blown-out tendon blood right on the ankle.  Be dialing.  We're starting the bidding here at about $6 billion.  $6 billion.  $6 billion.  $6 billion.  $6 billion.  I want to be Anthony, too.  Like Gallagher, too.  Like Gallagher?  Like Gallagher's brother?  I really want to start doing voices again on the radio show.  I used to do them back in the day.  Back in the day.  And then you came along and ruined it for me. 
[00:36:30]  Some of my voices were okay.  Sure.  But then you came along and perfected this voice thing on the radio.  And radiated it.  And now I don't even attempt it.  But if I attempt it as Anthony, too, which everyone will know can compare to what you do,  it might be funny.  Yes.  What do you do?  What voices?  I'd love to hear one.  No, you wouldn't.  I would.  Spuds.  Spuds Buckley.  Spuds Buckley did have a character voice.  What did Spuds sound like?  I don't remember.  It was a real long time ago.  And there's no tape that exists anymore. 
[00:37:00]  So it's very unfortunate.  I couldn't listen to the tape and maybe reenact what it used to sound like back in the day.  Yeah.  What do you think he might sound like?  I really couldn't tell you.  I'm kind of curious.  I couldn't tell you.  Shut up.  All right.  Let's say hi to Bruce.  He's in PA.  Bruce called the show yesterday.  He's been married twice, I do believe.  Bruce.  Ah.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-boys.  Not that Bruce, of course.  I'm looking for a job at XM Satellite Radio because I'm a consultant in Boston and it's  not going quite well these days. 
[00:37:30]  B-b-b-b-b-b-boys.  Hey, there's my Bruce voice.  That's good.  Oh, that's right.  You do an impression.  That's pretty good, right?  Bruce Mittman.  Very good.  My Bruce is pretty good.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-boys.  B-b-b-boys.  Don't forget to tell the New York Times that I was the one who discovered you, boys, when  you were working at WBAB.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-boys.  You know, our shwoogie knows how to clinch the game.  Your shwoogies don't know how to win when it counts, boys.  B-b-b-boys, when you're doing your new show for XM Satellite Radio, please stay away from 
[00:38:00]  the shwoogies.  You know, Boston isn't racist, and I'm not racist, but, uh, yes, our coons are much better  at baseball than yours.  B-b-b-b-boys.  B-b-b-b-boys.  I'd like to spend more time trying to develop the Opie and Anthony show, but I have a very  important golf date to get to.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-boys.  Boys.  Maybe if I wasn't playing golf and I was at the station on that faithful day,  you wouldn't have said the mayor of Boston was dead, b-b-b-boys. 
[00:38:30]  But I had to get the rope ladder and...  Get out of my SUV.  And get out of my SUV to play some golf, b-b-b-boys.  I don't like when you tell everyone that I'm a midget.  I'm actually 5'4", b-b-b-boys.  Yeah.  Oh, Brucey.  Did you really say on that faithful day?  Huh?  Or was it faithful?  I always say faithful when it's supposed to be fateful.  Did I say faithful again?  Sure did.  Norton will never, ever let you slide. 
[00:39:00]  You know, I do have a problem with faithful and fateful.  And some other ass pointed out...  You've got to have fate that you'll get over that problem.  What do you say if one girl catches you banging another one?  Honey, I've always been fateful to you.  Yeah, I guess that wouldn't work.  Thanks for ruining the bit, though.  It was great.  I waited until you were done.  You told me to do a voice.  It did a voice.  We were doing pretty well with it.  It was excellent.  But I had to just...  I was wondering...  It was excellent. 
[00:39:30]  It was excellent.  Maybe he said on that faithful day for a reason.  Are you patronizing me, you ass?  No, no, no.  I don't even know what Mittman sounds like.  I never met him.  So as far as I'm concerned...  He is a character.  We will get him back on the show.  We love the guy, and we also hate the guy at the same time.  How does Mittman sound if he was doing a Spuds Buckley impression?  I don't know how that would sound.  I have to ask you this, though.  Did Spuds Buckley have glasses?  Why are you obsessed with this whole Spuds Buckley thing?  Because the whole country is about Spuds Buckley.  Do you understand?  No one can get enough of Spuds Buckley.  We're all obsessed with it.  Spuds Buckley audio, people. 
[00:40:00]  Spuds Buckley audio.  Be dialing.  Unfortunately, it doesn't exist, Anthony.  Did he have glasses?  Yeah, that was before my laser eye surgery, sure.  Order now.  Get Jason Jambi's tumor.  Jason Jambi's tumor, people.  Jason Jambi's tumor.  We don't even know where the hell it came from.  No one will tell us.  No one's telling us where the tumor came from.  But be dialing.  It could be yours. 
[00:40:30]  It could be yours.  The tumor.  We got Joe Torrey's snot.  Joe Torrey's big booger snot.  And it's got a hair in it.  Look, people.  Let me show the camera.  Get the camera over here.  Look at the hair.  The nose hair coming out of this Joe Torrey booger.  It's a Joe Torrey booger snot.  And you're going to get a McGuire rookie card included.  Actually, we're going to wipe the booger on the rookie card and send it off to you. 
[00:41:00]  Order it on FlexPay.  Only $10 a week for 862 weeks.  I love that guy.  Where did he go?  Oh, he's now announcing wrestling.  Remember?  We got him on the show, actually.  All right.  So Bruce was married twice, I do believe.  Oh, yeah, boy.  And he called the show yesterday.  He was getting some advice on massage parlors.  He wanted to find one where they give him the happy ending.  And we said to go to an Asian one, didn't we? 
[00:41:30]  I don't remember.  But, again, I'm not big on the Asian ones, but they do happy endings.  All right, Bruce, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Good morning.  I just want to thank little Jimmy Norton for giving me the inspiration.  I went home and I called the parlor last night.  And they said no appointments necessary.  All right, hold on, hold on.  What was the name of the parlor?  Because some of these places have great names.  After Hours.  After Hours.  Sounds legit.  Oh, yeah.  After Hours and no appointment necessary?  Oh, yeah.  That's good for sports injuries.  I emptied my wallet to make sure I only brought some cash with me. 
[00:42:00]  And here's a tip for everyone.  Bring some 10s because they don't have change of a 20.  You know what I mean?  If it's 50, it's hard to hand three 20s over and expect her to give you back 10.  Yeah, change.  There's no change there.  All right, so walk us through it.  You drive up to After Hours.  You probably park in the back so no one sees your car, right?  Well, I kind of back in and go underneath a tree, yeah.  So, you know, I look for the darkest entrance in, of course. 
[00:42:30]  Okay.  Yeah, sometimes you've got to camouflage yourself.  And you hit a button and some chick comes to the window and she lets you in.  And the transaction takes place.  There's the house money that goes up.  How much?  How much?  The prices are on the wall.  Prices are on the wall?  And that was $40 for a half an hour.  And what, 60 for the hour or 60 for the hour?  I gave her $40, went into the room, and then she told me to strip down, came back.  Wait, was she Asian?  No.  No, she was like a 22-year-old white chick with pierced breasts. 
[00:43:00]  Was she not supposed to be sexy?  She was a college student.  Was she cute?  She was seriously wrong there.  All right.  She was a college student.  She was white.  She had pierced nips.  What do you mean something's wrong, sir?  That's everything that's right.  Oiled me down a little bit.  All right.  It hit me over.  Apparently, in Pennsylvania, you can get massaged anywhere you put their hands.  Wait, what?  What's the rule?  I love these rules and laws that they have.  You have to put their hands there. 
[00:43:30]  You had to grab her hand and put it on your schwanz.  And that makes it legal?  Apparently.  Gotta love PA, man.  They make up their own rules as they go along.  And she said, well, I gotta get up for school in the morning.  Aw, just making it all hotter and hotter.  Walked out embarrassed.  Wait, so did you get a real massage, or it was just all about the jerking?  No, it was a little bit of a rub down, but no real firmness from the hands.  You know what I mean?  All right, so you're laying there. 
[00:44:00]  No deep tissue massage, Opie.  It wasn't a wrecking massage.  You're laying there looking all awkward and stuff.  Obviously.  Aw.  Yeah.  And what?  Did she take her top off?  Yeah, she did.  That was part of the price.  But how did that come about?  She goes, have you ever been here before?  She goes, well, here are my prices.  $40 for my top off, you know, $80 to be naked, and then $150, and you can massage me. 
[00:44:30]  $150, you can touch her?  Yeah.  Can you do her for $150?  I don't know if you can do her, but you can touch her.  All right, so she takes her top off.  Did she have a nice set?  They were young and parky and pierced.  And pierced.  Was she a good looking woman?  She was an attractive young girl, yes.  All right, so okay, now she's topless.  You're completely naked, laying on your back?  I was laying on my stomach first.  All right.  Wow.  For the regular massage, right? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  All right, so how did she make the move that it was time to, you know, do the happy ending?  She said, flip over, and she says, why don't you move that towel or get there?  And then she was done rubbing.  She says, would you like me to massage anywhere else?  And I said, yeah.  She says, well, put my hand there.  Oh, man.  I helped her out.  That is really funny.  Do you put it on your shoulder?  Yeah, a little pain here.  A little pain right there on my shoulder. 
[00:45:30]  Mr. Awkward Guy.  Yeah, the back of my knee, you idiot.  That's amazing.  You've got to take it.  That's kind of awkward.  Yeah, it's not sexy like that.  You should have curled her hand into a fist and put it by your bum.  I can only hear Opie's mic.  Can you massage this, please?  Say that again?  I can only hear Opie's mic.  Oh, great.  Is that the problem?  I knew we'd have one problem today.  When I was on hold, I could hear the whole show.  That's today's problem.  You can only hear my mic.  Great.  Wait, you can't hear me, sir?  So the interaction going on between that. 
[00:46:00]  And you can't hear me, sir?  And I'll have to listen for that later.  And we all know I'm a bore, so this is going to be great.  Oh, come on now.  Jesus.  I'll punch out then.  No, no.  This is too good, though.  So...  Okay.  Originally, I called the service, and I got a call back, and they said that we have three  grades of ladies.  It's $150, $1.75, and $200 to come to the house.  And then you tip them whatever you see fit.  You know, then they have their own grade.  So what do you get for $200? 
[00:46:30]  You get the good-looking girl.  Can we get the guy in here to fix the phones?  Everyone's hello.  The phones aren't working.  Everyone's just staring at us.  Jesus Christ.  Sorry, my mic doesn't work on the phone, so I'll continue to yell.  For all the people that just turned on their XM satellite radios overnight, thank you.  What you're hearing here is more growing pains on the new Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Any other questions for Bruce?  I'll just move the mic around the room, because this is how radio should be.  Jim?  One mic.  How many girls were there to choose from, sir? 
[00:47:00]  She was the only one.  She answered the door and came to the window and then moved me right back to the parlor,  shall we say.  So when she was giving you the happy ending, did she look all sexy, or did she look very,  very disgusted?  Is she a good actress, is what I'm trying to find out here.  I think she was a pretty good actress, yes.  Really?  Did she use anything to help you along?  Baby oil?  Yeah, baby oil.  Yeah.  For the $150, I could massage her the same way she said.  All right, hold on. 
[00:47:30]  Anthony has a question.  Wait, you could then have her put your hand in her lap and massage her vagina?  Yes, that's what she told me.  And you're paying $150 for this?  Yes, but I only bought $120 because I didn't want to lose all my money.  Ah, that's smart.  And I'm going back.  Only bring as much as you're willing to spend.  All right, so your baby batter, what, went flying on your belly and she wiped it off and 
[00:48:00]  you were out of there?  That was about it?  She cleans up?  That was about it.  Opie, would you ask him, she cleans up for you?  Uh, she cleaned it up for you?  Uh, no.  No, I basically was giving the towel.  Oh, they just throw you a towel?  That should be...  $150, what do you want?  That should be included in the price that they wipe it up.  Then you got that degrading time that you have to lay there and clean up your own spunk.  What is she doing while you're cleaning up?  Yeah, I felt like Jimmy Norton. 
[00:48:30]  What is she doing while you're cleaning up?  Oh, she's putting her clothes back on.  Wait.  Jimmy wants in.  Hold on a sec.  Afterwards, did you leave right away or did you at least get the joy of watching her make  the sign of the cross and cry a little bit?  I don't know.  I couldn't see the tears of my own eyes.  All right, so you paid the $40 to the house and then how much did you leave in the room  there?  $60.  Wow, look at you.  $60. 
[00:49:00]  Hey, listen, now I know how much I got to bring and I don't need to spend any more.  It was a good learning experience.  And this was your first experience at a massage parlor?  Yeah, but you know, there's been some street walkers in the past.  Do you think you'll go back to this place?  Tuesdays and Thursday nights.  Wow.  Is that when she works?  Yes.  What's her name or you don't want to say?  I don't want to say.  I don't know.  Is she hot?  Yeah, she was hot.  Her name was Bob. 
[00:49:30]  The stripper name was Alexis.  All right, very good.  So then you were happy with your experience.  You paid the little tip on the bed and then what?  And then you just walked out?  Yeah, until I got home and had a shower.  Of course.  Of course.  All right.  Where does he live?  Where do you live?  He lives in PA somewhere.  He lives in PA, yeah.  I commute up to North Jersey every day.  So I'm glad you guys are back.  You make the day go a lot.  You know, threw Howard out the window in the morning. 
[00:50:00]  And I just listen to you guys all day.  I can't understand why you would turn off Howard.  I mean, all that talk about Bush is very, very interesting.  It's extremely interesting.  We'll be back after this half hour of commercials.  Hey, Jimmy.  What's that, sir?  I didn't hear you, mister.  I'm sorry.  He said, go Bush.  Yeah, I think Jimmy's voting for Bush.  I don't know.  If I vote, I'm going to vote for Kerry.  And I think Anthony's still on the fence.  Yeah, yeah.  I have no idea who I want to vote for. 
[00:50:30]  We'll take him rise in the next couple weeks.  He'll just step on me because he can't hear me.  I know.  He can't hear me.  Holy ass.  All right, well.  All right, thank you, Bruce.  I can't wait to listen to the rest of the day.  See you later.  All right.  Bye, fella.  Well, it looks like Bruce had a very, very nice experience at the massage party.  Sounds pretty nice.  Do our mics work now regular?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Sounds romantic.  Put your hand on my...  Oh, you've got to grab her hand and lay it on...  Do you lay it right on it, or do you put it close, or do you put it on your bag?  But how does that make it legal? 
[00:51:00]  It's not.  I don't know.  This is what Bruce just did.  He figured that that's what this dumb chick thinks.  Well, this dumb bitch has convinced herself that she goes to court, she can go,  well, a cop put my hand there.  You dummy.  That doesn't make it legal.  Doesn't work.  Of course not.  You know how many times I've tried that with somebody who was in my charge?  Parents won't be home for a while.  The old gag.  I'm going to ask you if you're a cop, and you know you're required to tell me.  Yeah.  And if you don't, it's...  No.  You know something?  They're not required to tell you, and they will still arrest you.  I love these people that think they have the inside skinny on the police department. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  My ex-girlfriend years ago told me, like, we drove by, we were speeding one time, but  we drove by a cop car, and he had no headlights on, and this dummy says, you know, he can't  even pull you over because he has to have his headlights on when you drive by.  Isn't that great?  I'm like, bitch, shut up.  Isn't that great?  What do you know about the police department?  Yeah.  They think they know.  When I went to law school, I learned this.  Your job is to lay back and take dick, and you don't even do that particularly well.  All of a sudden, you have the ins and outs of the law. 
[00:52:00]  Your Honor, he didn't have his lights on.  Well, fire that pig.  What's the matter with you, stupid?  You hear the gallery in the courtroom go, oh.  Reporters run out to go file their story at the payphones with their press hats on.  This just in.  Stop the press.  Stop the press.  There's headlights wearing on.  Headlights weren't on.  Copy boy.  Ridiculous.  They all know the ins and outs. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, everyone's got it.  They have to tell you.  Yeah, really?  Do they?  Everyone knows.  No, they don't.  They'll do whatever they want.  They can pull a Buford pusser and knock your headlights out with a stick.  Doesn't matter.  All right, well, there's a lot of great phones, but we can't go to them, so I guess we're going  to have to take a break and hopefully fix the phones.  We'll take a break.  I see the repair team is right behind Opie, ready to come in like a NASCAR pit crew.  Out. 
[00:53:00]  Very nice.  Full of fuel.  Let it go.  Maybe I can do the sound effects.  Excellent.  I think I do sound effects pretty good.  Do the wrench, the air wrench.  How would Spud Buckley do that wrench?  All right, Anthony, you're a professional.  How does it sound?  I don't know.  Oh, that's better than mine.  Wait, let me try again.  I'm Gallagher.  I can't do it.  I'm Gallagher, too.  That sounds like the drill, though.  The drill, though. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  All right, well, the pit crew's coming in to try to fix today's problems, Anthony.  Also, we've got to warn people that we're going to quote a break.  We can't call them commercial breaks.  They're a break, and I guess that's when your eardrums are blown out because they still haven't  figured out how to keep the levels completely even on this radio show.  It's only been two and a half weeks, so I'm going to warn you to turn down the volume now  so you don't lose your hearing.  Actually, it'll be after Fag Talk because that's coming from New York.  Uh-huh.  Does this make sense to anybody?  Yeah, and then right after Fag Talk.  So you can keep your volume where it is. 
[00:54:00]  Listen to Fag Talk.  Right after Fag Talk is when you want to turn down your volume a little bit so you don't  blow out your eardrums and bust your windows, okay?  Very nice of you.  It's amazing that a professional radio show has to tell people to turn down the volume  so they don't hurt themselves.  Well, it's better to go to Washington.  There's no reason to do it all here.  Better to bounce back and forth.  That's the way it should be.  Right.  Easier.  They're busy doing press conferences.  They're in New York today.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  No commissioner.  Here's Fag Talk.  This program funded by the British Arts Foundation. 
[00:54:30]  Hello, welcome once again to Fag Talk, the show where we talk about fags, and I must  explain something.  We're on in America now, and we'd like to welcome our American audience, except for the  one thing, there seems to be some confusion with the cards and letters we're getting from  the States, which say that fag is actually a word used for something else there, and of  course we're talking about cigarettes on the show, so let's get right to it.  Welcome to Fag Men.  Bob the Fag Men is here.  Right.  Welcome on the show.  You've brought some lovely fags.  Let's see what you've got. 
[00:55:00]  I've brought some great fags this week.  This one right here is from Russia.  Grab the butt of that fag right there.  Okay, I've got the butt right here.  I'm grabbing the butt of this fag.  Slide that fag right in your mouth.  Right.  I mean, slide the fag right in my mouth.  Now, I've got the fag.  Suck on that fag.  That's a great fag.  Mmm.  Mmm.  I love this one.  Now, take a look at this fag right here.  It's much bigger than all the other fags.  That's a big fag.  You know?  It's a very large fag.  It's a firm fag.  It's...  Let me feel that.  Oh, I like the way that feels.  It's just like a fondle, this fag, right in my fingers here.  You can fondle that fag for days.  And it's a big one. 
[00:55:30]  It's big and it's hard.  If you want to go to a different way, you can go with a small fag.  Oh, look at that little fag.  That's a tiny little fag.  It's a great fag.  Look at you, little fag.  Come here.  Oh, yeah.  I like the taste of that one and I like sucking on that fag.  So, those are three for today.  That's wonderful.  Thank you so much for being here.  Bob the Fag Man's been on the show.  Join us again next time when Bob and I visit a fag party.  Nothing but fags and drinks.  It's going to be wonderful.  All fags, all the time, right here on Fag Talk.  Bye-bye.  Flower shop? 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, hello.  Is this a flower shop?  It is.  Yeah, this is Spoonie Love from up above.  I want to send some flowers to somebody.  Two dozen red roses.  And on the card that we're going to attach to the roses, what would you like?  Oh, I got the cards and all that.  Okay, let me see what I want.  Now, it's a small card.  You know, that little enclosure card.  You might have to put two in there because I got some things I want to say to her.  Okay, what would you like?  Yo, baby, I love you.  Okay. 
[00:56:30]  I love you more than you know.  Okay.  But you did me wrong.  Give one dude a BJ, shame on you.  Okay.  Give two dudes a BJ, shame on me.  Okay.  If you think I can't get to you, you're wrong.  Uh-huh.  You ain't nothing but a stupid hoe.  You've always been a stupid hoe, and you will always be a hoe.  You got that? 
[00:57:00]  Uh-huh.  Love always your teddy bear.  Spoonie.  S-P-O-O-N-Y?  Yeah.  Could you read that back to me, please?  Oh, I got it right.  Could you read it?  I know, but I just want to make sure.  Could you read it back to me?  Oh, no.  Could you read that back to me, please?  No.  Let me see if I can even write this.  You might have to come in and write it.  Okay.  But what was wrong?  The hoe message.  The hoe or the hoe? 
[00:57:30]  The hoe message?  Yeah.  When I call it a hoe and stuff?  Yeah.  Could we change the word hoe then?  You know another word for hoe?  No.  I'll let me.  Do you know another word for hoe that we could use?  We can't put sexual messages on there.  Hoe is sexual?  What would you say?  I mean, what would you suggest?  I would just say, I'm sorry.  My cousin, she gave two of my cousin's BJ's on Thanksgiving Day.  I just went and put a car.  Right on Thanksgiving Day at my mother's house. 
[00:58:00]  She gave them both BJ's and I was in the closet.  Because I didn't believe it.  I love my woman.  You know what I'm saying?  I loved her, you know?  But we can put.  And I saw it for myself.  She was doing both of them at the same time.  On her knees.  Gagging and everything, yo.  I can put.  I love you.  Could we change BJ's to smoking a sausage or something?  Blowing the pole?  I can't do anything like that.  What do you call a BJ?  I couldn't.  We can't do that.  We just can't do that.  Have you ever took part in that?  Have you ever been a part in that? 
[00:58:30]  Uh-uh.  You've never given no one a BJ?  No.  No.  What?  I just can't do that.  You're really offended me.  Please, please, please.  Could you just read it back?  I can't.  I can't talk to you no more.  It's everything 24-7.  XM-202.  The O&A virus.  It's everything. 
[00:59:00]  All the time.  It was Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, so I flashed some guy on the Long Island Expressway.  He was involved in a seven-car pileup.  There was blood and carnage everywhere.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of the O.P. and Anthony Show. 
[00:59:30]  That's right.  It's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday, Anthony.  Yes, it is.  Love the wow.  Actually, it's now Whip-Em-Out Whenever.  We changed it a long time ago.  Basically, ladies, if you see a wow on the highway, that's a guy that would love to see  your fun bags.  Simple as that.  You put a wow on your car, if the ladies feel like it, they're going to flash you on  the road as you're driving in the dark here on the East Coast. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah, I know.  A little dark.  A little dark.  And getting lots and lots of complaints from the listeners.  I guess you could go to opiananthony.com and get your wow stickers by just leaving your  address.  But supposedly, what I'm hearing, enough emails coming in, so it's got to be true.  They're just not getting their wow stickers yet.  Yeah.  They're just not getting their wow stickers yet.  We've got to get those things out there.  Well, I think XM Satellite Radio is very busy making very, very big deals today.  And maybe the wow stickers, that thing, that's going to have to be on the back burner for 
[01:00:30]  a few more days.  XM Satellite on the eel day.  You know.  Can I ask a question?  Yes, Jim Norton.  I'm just reading the post and it says, Mrs. McGee's pad, McGreevy's wife obviously leaving.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The governor of New Jersey, we like to call him Governor McGreedy.  I want to know how long.  He's gay, yes.  And he's leaving his wife finally?  Or is she leaving him finally?  She moved out of the mansion and got a nice little place. 
[01:01:00]  Little ranch place.  Little ranch.  And I want to know, how many dates is a guy going to go on with her before he decides  to ask her if she's ever been tested?  You know that no guy is going to bang her.  Oh, I know.  Right away.  If you know where she's been, yeah.  Who the hell knows?  She's been married to this guy.  This guy's had some secret gay sex life.  And who knows, if he was banging her to keep up appearances, maybe she's got a little something.  Maybe.  She's got a hiv catcher. 
[01:01:30]  That's got to be, she's got to feel just worthless.  Yeah.  Moving out now, she's going to have her own place.  She's on her own.  It's like a sitcom plot, you know?  You're married to the gay governor and then you move out on your own to get some real man  cock.  Like Alice.  Yeah.  It's to be said, my husband's a cock and I never knew why.  There's a new cock in town and it's looking good.  There's a fresh jizz stain in my neighborhood. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah.  It's like a bad sitcom plot.  She moves out, goes to the house, and gets real man cock.  Mm-mm.  And when does Mr. Roper come walking in and ruin everything?  Ah, the wacky neighbor.  No, the wacky neighbor.  Come over and constantly ribs her about being married to the gay guy.  So cobwebs on that snatch, I guess.  So how's your husband, Jack Tripper? 
[01:02:30]  Smile to the camera.  Anthony, could you explain to that dummy on instant feedback what's going on here today?  We got the pit crew in here attempting to fix the phones as we try to do a radio show.  That's not too distracting.  You mean Cody in Buffalo?  Yeah, Cody.  Cody in Buffalo, you tool.  What does Cody write on the instant feedback?  Commenting on the segment we just got through with when we were talking on the phone with  a gentleman from Pennsylvania that had gone to a whorehouse hoping. 
[01:03:00]  And your mic is the only one he heard over the phone.  Because mine and Jimmy's doesn't work over the phone.  None of the calls can hear it.  So we were yelling into your microphone.  This is the only mic that the listeners could hear.  And Cody from Buffalo says,  We hear you guys fine on the radio.  It's just over the phone.  Now you guys just sound retarded yelling.  No, see.  Are there people that just don't get it?  Anthony and Jim have to yell into this mic so the caller could hear them.  We're yelling into Opie's microphone so the caller can hear us. 
[01:03:30]  And we realize it's ridiculous.  That's what made it kind of fun.  Cody from Buffalo.  In a weird way.  He's from Buffalo, though.  You've got to cut him a little slack.  All right.  Anthony, on the way, on the program, we're almost ready.  Almost ready.  For a new segment on the new Opie and Anthony show.  A game we like to call Coming or Going.  Oh.  Coming or Going.  Coming or Going.  Coming soon.  Coming or Going.  Coming or Going, yes.  And Norton was yelling and screaming about Paris Hilton during the, 
[01:04:00]  what do we call them?  They're not commercial breaks.  Although I think we're going to have sponsors very, very soon.  I had to take that meeting yesterday.  During the distraction?  I had to take the sponsorship meeting yesterday.  What meeting?  Who did you meet with yesterday?  D.  You know D.  You met with him?  Well, not.  The phone thing.  Oh, a phone call.  Okay.  Our phones ring all day long.  Anthony's the smart one that turns his off so they get me.  And then we try to conference you and, oh, whoops, I don't know where he is.  We can't get him on the phone.  Hey, that's right. 
[01:04:30]  You're a smart man.  I was snoozing.  You've got to take your little naps if you're going to make it through the game.  I know what's going on.  A lot of sponsors want to come on the Opie and Anthony show.  And we love our sponsors.  Of course we do.  Everyone knows that from the old show.  But all these sponsors, they need to be suckled.  Suckled?  They need to be suckled.  They need us to...  Hottled?  They need us to take out Jim Norton's big man boobs and they need to suck a little bit.  They need to feel like they're part of the team.  Part of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  Like, there was a time in radio where, wow, this is a really hot, popular radio show. 
[01:05:00]  I'm going to advertise with the Opie and Anthony show.  That's how it used to work in the old days.  But now they need these...  The relationships.  They need to come in and hang out a little bit.  And we have to schmooze with them.  It's like a couple of dates first before they go all the way.  Pretty much.  Pretty much we're starting our dating process with the sponsorships.  We have to hold hands first.  Pretty much.  Go to a movie.  And then eventually they suckle off Norton's man boobs.  Sorry, but...  That's all right. 
[01:05:30]  I used to have man boobs, but I've been going to the gym and so it wouldn't...  I sure can tell you have been.  It wouldn't work as...  It's obvious in that sweater.  Shut up.  I know this.  Broad chest.  Maybe I shouldn't have freaking dried this sweater, huh?  Jesus.  Anyway, so what do you got on Parris Hilt?  Nothing.  I thought you were yelling and screaming about Parris Hilt.  I love her.  No, just that a friend is saying that she's the nigger all the time.  Right.  She's the N-word.  You know, we can't say that word in the English language.  You've been quoting somebody.  She uses the N-word. 
[01:06:00]  That's what the...  Yeah.  Is that a surprise to anybody?  She's whiter than white.  And hanging out with her whiter than white friends, that word gets ballied around a little bit.  That's what shocks Hollywood.  It's not the fact that she's being used and skewered by two mules.  It's the fact that she says nigger every once in a while.  And her family's worth $400 million.  Well, the problem is she got caught.  I mean, everyone uses the N-word.  Absolutely.  Everyone uses the N-word.  Somebody cuts you off or they're really old, yelling out the car window. 
[01:06:30]  She just got caught.  That's the problem.  I think it's basic human nature to, especially if you're angry, to just go for the obvious.  This morning, driving in, which I was documenting a little bit of on my camcorder, my drive-in.  Oh, that's really smart.  Well, yeah, I know.  I was thinking that, too, as I'm going.  It's like, oh, jeez.  Maybe I shouldn't document this.  But I'm kind of an angry driver.  Kind of?  Kind of, yeah.  So maybe I could isolate a few clips.  Can't you run audio in your car? 
[01:07:00]  I used to love when you and I drove in together.  Well, that's what the camera does.  So you got audio on there?  It's got a microphone.  What do you think?  It's got a hand crank on the side and everything comes out in black and white and fast motion  when I play it back?  But, I mean, you got actual audio from this morning's commute in?  Yeah.  Is there anything worth playing on the air?  I think when this chink wouldn't move over, and I only used that term because he upset  me.  That's what I was talking about.  You go for the obvious thing.  You can't look at somebody that just cut you off and decide, hmm, you didn't go to college, 
[01:07:30]  guy, or hey, you're not quite as intelligent as the other guy.  Well, yeah, you can, actually, if you're going along the same things.  Oh, that's what I'm saying.  You go for the obvious, and you're angry with them, so you're not going to try to be  politically correct.  You're alone in your car, and you use bad language.  You use racist terminology sometimes.  If you see a Puerto Rican who cuts you off, you yell, hey, I didn't go to college, guy.  You might not be right, but you might. 
[01:08:00]  Hey, knock up another one, guy.  That's right.  Hey, drop another baby, girl.  So what happened this morning?  I was making the turn to head toward the Queensborough Bridge.  Were you going the right way on this road?  Yes, I wasn't doing the wrong way.  And I didn't go the wrong way down that one-way street.  Look at you following the rules of the road.  No, no, no.  I didn't go the wrong way down the one-way street because I was backing up.  You went backwards down the...  My car was facing the proper direction.  And the police cannot give you a ticket if your car is facing... 
[01:08:30]  Right.  As long as your headlights are on.  As we make more rules on the Opie and Anthony show today.  We have to put your...  They have to take your hand and put it on the road sign.  Right, right.  Exactly.  Your hand must be on that one-way sign.  Have you ever driven with him?  No.  I did in Washington.  D.C.  We were driving to D.C.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was great.  Another person that needs to tape themselves as they go to their spots all over New York  City is Norton.  Yeah, I'm aggressive.  You are the worst.  Next time I hang out with you and we go to all the comedy clubs, I'm taping you. 
[01:09:00]  He loses his mind maybe more than you, Anthony.  Yeah, I've calmed down.  But things still upset me.  And when I'm driving around, like I said, you know, you see something and you go...  And this morning, I was like, dog, figures, typical.  I was like, typical, can't drive.  You know, because Asians typically in the stereotype cannot drive.  I stink!  This guy, we make the turn.  It's one of those turns where it's two lanes that are turning left.  I'm in the left lane.  He's in the right lane.  Now, when you make the turn, stay in your lane. 
[01:09:30]  This guy comes cutting across into my lane.  What am I supposed to do?  I lay on the horn and then he proceeds to do five miles an hour.  So now I got to cut into the lane he was in and pass him.  And as I'm passing him, I take a look.  Ah!  And I go, of course.  Ah!  Of course.  And he's not looking at you, is he?  No.  He's looking straight ahead, just straight ahead.  Does no clue.  He just screwed up.  And I, I, you said a goddamn, what did I say?  Goddamn chink.  Eh. 
[01:10:00]  Because you're alone in your car, you're angry, and you go for the obvious.  It's, it's basic human nature.  And you're like, ah, no one's going to hear me say this.  No one's going to hear it.  Until Steve gets the tape and...  Right.  ...gets it available for the radio show.  Oh, no, figures.  Yeah.  You know what I yelled one time?  I don't like to even admit this on the radio.  One time this, uh, this guy cut me off, and I yelled, where'd you get your license?  Out of a Cracker Jack box?  Oh.  Oh.  Ooh.  I know.  That's a little much.  Yeah, I don't know.  It's kind of embarrassing.  That's a little much.  Well, I, I kind of... 
[01:10:30]  Why don't you just do what you used to do and just drive up on the sidewalk?  Um, well, there wasn't much traffic, so I could just go around them.  But if need be, although with the newer vehicle, I, I don't do that until I'm into my lease  about a year or so, then I just...  Are you leasing?  My leases are a mess.  Yeah, I, I lease.  The last one was my Pathfinder, and by the end of the lease, I remember once I was late  getting to Kennedy Airport, and I was, I was in a hell of a rush, and I had to make  the plane in order to get to a boat in Florida that was leaving. 
[01:11:00]  So it wasn't one of those, just take a later flight.  I drove down the median strip of the Belt Parkway at about, at about 70 miles an hour,  between the two lanes of traffic, and I hit a drainage ditch.  I swear it was a Starsky and Hutch launch.  The, the truck was airborne.  Oh, man.  When I pulled into, uh, the Kennedy Airport, the parking lot I was going to, I, I just shut  the truck off.  I grabbed the luggage out of the back. 
[01:11:30]  The smell that was coming off of this vehicle was, only as I can imagine, the launch pad smells  at the Cape when they're sending up the shuttle.  Just everything burning.  It was clicking, and smoke was coming out from under the hood.  And I just left it there.  That's hilarious.  And then you return these leases, and they sell them like, you know, hey.  Yeah, like they're brand new cars, basically.  Gently used.  I had to throw it through the car wash.  We could resell this one.  I was going like a madman.  I know he's not a madman.  I used to see, Anthony, do the craziest crap in New York City. 
[01:12:00]  I will use sidewalks all the time.  I will get up on a sidewalk and drive on the sidewalk.  Because, because, yeah, if there's people in the way, sure.  Nobody, when you're in traffic, do you just honk?  Only if someone's screwing up.  If I'm just in dead stop traffic, and I've gotten better with this, I'll kind of, you  know, I'll kind of deal with it.  Like, eh, what are you going to do?  Good point, Anthony.  What are you going to do?  But, um, if I see an out, I'll take it.  Even the illegal ones.  Shoulders, medians. 
[01:12:30]  No, no one's safe, Opie.  All right.  Uh, I would love to go to the phones, but.  Hmm.  We like to call it growing pains on the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah.  As we put this whole radio program back together, we are the true underdogs.  We're in the underdog position, and, man, they're not making it any easier around here.  No.  We're attempting the biggest comeback in radio history.  We need everything to work.  Like, it's hard enough to try to get back on top without, uh, the equipment not working 
[01:13:00]  on a daily basis.  At least the problems seem to be one at a time.  When we first started a couple of weeks ago, uh, the problems were all clustered, and we'd  have a bunch of things.  So we're getting closer to having everything, uh, working every single day.  Yeah.  Well, we're not allowed to, well, we're allowed to, but it's not really going to help us to  bitch every day.  Have you been told not to bitch?  Nah, they hint that, uh, you know, you want them on your side.  I haven't, I can't even remember the last XM person I spoke with outside of this place.  I don't accept the calls. 
[01:13:30]  Did you give them a wrong cell phone number?  I turn my cell phone off.  Dude, they call all day long.  I have someone that calls all day long, but he's called Frenchy.  Oh, God.  Yesterday, I get home, I'm figuring I'm going to take my snooze so I can wake up later.  It's a very fine line.  You can't sleep too long, because then you won't be able to get to sleep at night.  And you'll be up until you have to leave, and then you'll be shot for the show.  But you can't sleep too short, because you'll get too tired, and then you'll fall asleep  I call it the gas analogy.  You know, you want to, you know, you're on empty, you need that sleep, so you put like 
[01:14:00]  a couple gallons of gas back in the tank, that's your little nap.  Don't fill it up.  But if you nap too long, you're going to fill it up.  No, you've got to fill it up later on at night, so you sleep through the night.  That's what happens.  That's a good analogy.  Thank you.  So you have enough gas when we're doing the morning show?  Unlettered or regular?  I don't know.  Today, uh, uh, it's regular.  And, um, what the hell was I saying?  Frenchy.  Frenchy.  He's out of control. 
[01:14:30]  Frenchy.  My phone starts ringing.  Meh, meh.  And I look, and I see it's Mark.  And I'm like, I'm trying to sleep.  I can't get into a telephone conversation.  And I know what it'll be.  How did I do?  Am I still on the show?  Because it got cut off, by the way.  We've got to address that, too, that our show just gets cut off at the end of the program.  Well, it has to.  It has to go to Washington.  It has to.  It has to.  So no one realizes what happened at the end of the Frenchy versus Frenchy bit yesterday.  Oh, my God.  You guys missed some unbelievable stuff.  They really didn't hear that yesterday? 
[01:15:00]  No.  Oh, wow.  No.  Wow.  I know.  Missed.  It was amazing.  Oh, well.  It was them just bitching at each other.  I don't even think we'd crowned a winner.  I'm not a big fan of the old characters from the old Opie and Anthony show.  Really?  You're looking to just clean house?  I think you and I.  Now he's going to call again.  Am I out?  I thought I did well.  I want to surrender.  I think it's quite obvious that Anthony and I want to completely reinvent our radio program  as we go to XM Satellite Radio.  Well, we're here already.  That's right.  No more retarded Laverne and Shirley. 
[01:15:30]  I think we really want to just reinvent this whole thing.  No more stalker padding.  I'll tell you why.  Our bits and our audio is all over the world at this point.  They got those alt alt dot binaries dot.  Newsgroups.  Yeah, newsgroups with all our audio.  Alt binaries erotica.  I don't know how to use these newsgroups.  Oh, my God.  It's a bevy of pornography that is untapped for you.  There's only like one newsgroup I don't have.  You have to show me how to really.  Aren't there like a bunch of newsgroups?  Yes.  They have a newsgroup for everything. 
[01:16:00]  You have to log on to the.  You have to download all the newsgroups.  So you have to find out what your server's newsgroup is.  Yeah, I don't know what that means.  Oh, I'll show you.  Yeah, yeah.  You have no idea what's out there.  It's an untapped reservoir of pornography that you're not tapping into.  You've seen all the pornography you can on the internet?  Oh, no.  Everything.  You have just screened.  Anything you're looking for.  Movies and pictures?  Everything.  Everything.  So all our stuff is all over the world at this point. 
[01:16:30]  People are listening to old Opie and Anthony shows, and that's where all the characters are.  We can't do anything else with these people.  Yeah.  We need new people.  You go to oavirus.com.  I mean, that kid's updating his audio clips every day.  We mentioned a little tidbit about something we used to do, and the whole bit's there for people to listen to.  I never liked the reunion show.  You know what I mean?  If you watch it on TV.  And opianthony.net, another place that has just tons and tons of old audio.  It's almost like doing a reunion show for a sitcom. 
[01:17:00]  Years later, they come back with the original cast.  They're doing it with Happy Days.  It's just never as good.  They're going to do it with Happy Days.  What is that?  They're actually going to do...  They're not going to do a clip show.  You know, like Carol Burnett?  They had a clip show.  They drag those people, put them on stools, and they're actually going to do an episode of Happy Days.  I talked about how funny they used to be.  Supposedly, it's going to be an actual Happy Days reunion.  Is everyone still alive?  I guess.  Are they acknowledging that they're actors, or are they playing their original roles? 
[01:17:30]  I think Eric or somebody could help me out here, but I think they're filming, you know, like it's Happy Days 20 years later.  Alphonse is like, what, 48, 51?  He's got to be in his 50s.  And he's going to be saying, hey, with his turkey neck.  Hey, hey, hey, change my colostomy bag.  What's up with the Happy Days reunion?  From what we were reading online, it's not like the original one they did years ago where they all sat together and reflected on that.  They're back, kind of like what Growing Pains has been doing the last few years, those new Growing Pains two-hour movies. 
[01:18:00]  You've been keeping tabs on that?  We all do.  No, we don't.  I've never seen Growing Pains.  I've never seen a Growing Pains reunion thing.  They just had the second one this past Saturday.  They make two-hour, like, mini-movie special things.  That's what they're doing with Happy Days.  Who are the people that are watching this?  It's like coming back, when they did Return to Mayberry, they made it like a two-hour movie for television.  That's what they're doing for Happy Days.  Don't try to cover up the Growing Pains confession.  No, I'm not.  I fully admit it.  I didn't see the second one.  Were you a fan of Growing Pains? 
[01:18:30]  In the 80s, yeah.  I never saw it.  I was a little kid when I was watching it, so I didn't know any better.  So what?  That's a great excuse.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was a little kid.  I played Monster Rain.  Same thing.  All right.  Sure.  There you go.  Now it makes all...  Growing Pains in your mouth.  Yes, Jimmy.  Yes.  So they're doing the Happy Days thing.  I wonder if one of the characters is going to come back with some tragic affliction, like  they did with the Brady Bunch when Bobby was...  Oh, Bobby was crippled?  It's like the Brady Bunch was a sitcom, and they do this reunion show, and Bobby comes 
[01:19:00]  back because he was in a race car accident, and now he's paralyzed from the waist down.  That's what they did in the episode.  What?  Yeah.  In the movie.  Oh.  It's like, all of a sudden, they turned the sitcom into a drama.  Yeah.  Well, did they...  Oh, and then the father got AIDS and died.  Oh, wait a minute.  That wasn't on the show.  I thought he was an architect.  He was a governor.  So what's going on?  I forget what we were talking about.  Is it going to be the Happy Days thing?  What year is it going to take place in? 
[01:19:30]  I don't know.  Are they going to age them?  Well, they've aged, but it was supposed to be the 50s.  So is it going to be the 70s?  I don't know.  It has to be.  They can't be 40 years older.  Bald Richie Cunningham at Studio 54 doing Coke.  It's going to be nice.  Hey.  All right.  I just picked up the AIDS.  You know, 70s, free love, nothing.  Jeez. 
[01:20:00]  Trying to explain it and everything.  It never works.  He'll call her shortcake.  She'll raise her hairy underarms because she's a feminist, and she'll slap his male pig face.  We have a great AIDS.  Yeah.  We have a great AIDS song.  I don't know about that, Ope.  It's a great AIDS song, but we're trying to figure out how much trouble we're going to  get in if we play it.  I think we'll get in huge trouble.  Because it's from Team America.  Right.  It's a great AIDS song.  We're trying to find out.  You know, we've got to weigh these issues.  How much trouble are we going to get into? 
[01:20:30]  Yes, Ben?  Well, the phone should work, though.  Oh, wow.  Oh, really?  They fixed it outside?  The phones are going to work, bro.  They should be able to work.  Oh, he's pushing some buttons.  Don't even explain what you did.  I have no idea.  Can we check?  All right.  Give her a try.  Give it a whirl.  All righty, then.  Let me take the call so we can see if they can hear it.  Well, this is a feel-good phone call.  All right.  Jeremy?  Yes, sir.  You can hear me?  Yes.  Can you hear me, too?  Yes.  And can you hear me?  Can I hear you now?  There we go. 
[01:21:00]  That's great.  Give that man a raise.  All right, Jeremy.  Jeremy, what do you have for the show now that we've got you on?  These guys are really something else.  Something else.  Something else.  What are we, then?  I thought we were what we were, but we're something else.  You're not your typical DJs, put it that way.  No, no.  We know that.  Are you new to the show, Jeremy?  I guess so, right?  Yeah.  Are you nude to the show?  No, you're nude to the show.  I said that kind of quickly.  I thought he was nude to the show. 
[01:21:30]  I have cold mouth because I'm drinking an iced latte, so I said my mouth doesn't work as well.  All right.  All right.  Well, so you like the show, right, Jeremy?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Thank you.  Yep.  Thank you, Jeremy.  Okay.  Bye for now.  Yep.  All right.  We're back on track.  This is good.  Hey, Anthony, we've got to get Steven here.  He's working on our coming or going game.  Uh-huh.  Also, believe it or not, we don't want to wreck the bit, but I think we've got more hot teen news today on the program. 
[01:22:00]  You know something?  Every day, the papers, the news sites, we're all full of hot teen news, and we never really even knew it.  We're trying to make this Opie and Anthony show more gooder, so we don't want to run bits into the ground like we used to.  Yeah.  But I'm telling you, there's more great hot teen news stories in the paper today.  Always.  It's like they're doing it on purpose.  Steve, how's the coming or going game going?  Hands tucked in up to the nipples.  Coming.  Uh-huh.  Jesus, Steve.  Pull the shirt out.  It's a medium.  God.  He's a tuck kind of guy. 
[01:22:30]  Stop tucking.  That looks so much better untucked, little v-neck.  I...  Stop tucking.  Nothing I do.  That looks good.  No, no.  Everything I do, everything I wear, irritates you.  Back off the mic a little bit.  I like that.  I like that.  That's the loose guy.  Yeah, much better.  You're making us all very uncomfortable.  You really like to tuck that shirt all the way in.  It's like you're Lebanese.  What are you hiding, a bomb belt?  We should make a shirt up for him that says, go tuck yourself.  Good-natured shirt.  I told you to tuck your mother.  At least he's...  Boom, bang. 
[01:23:00]  At least he doesn't have any flames on his attire today.  I bet you these boxers do.  He sent me an email yesterday.  He got all excited because on eBay they're selling boots with flames.  Yeah.  And you want to make a bid on those, don't you?  Not, Henry.  I'm trying to tuck this broad.  Here's a little help here.  Too broad.  It doesn't like big, thick Lebanese fingers.  Every day.  It never gets old.  You're a big tattoo tucker. 
[01:23:30]  All right, so how's the coming or going game going?  It's going well.  You think we'll do it today?  No, we won't do it today.  I actually have a good stash at home that I have to go for three.  Oh, wow.  All right.  No, it's got to be good.  That means we're going to have to find more stuff.  As I'm doing this, I'm going to be doing it.  Are we going to have it on Skull Shirt Day or Flame Shirt Day?  Flame Shirt Day.  But you know what?  Even Skull and Flame Shirt Day are roll up the edge of the shirt sleeve and iron it day.  Is there any reason?  Is there any reason?  I wish people in Radio Land could see the fact that this sociopath is wearing a black t-shirt 
[01:24:00]  and he rolls up the part of the edge of the black sleeve and then irons it so there's like a little cuff.  Oh, that's the show off those big bicep.  Look at how size it is.  I spent months getting my arms tattooed.  Why not show them off?  I know, but you only do it a quarter inch.  Just get a tank top.  Show off the arms.  He probably measures it with a tank measure.  You know why?  Because I walk in here with a tank top and it's more ammunition.  I wouldn't make fun of you a tank top.  That's true.  Yeah.  Right.  You know the pressure now every day. 
[01:24:30]  He probably wakes up and looks at the shirts and goes, no, I can't even.  No, I know I'm going to catch up with this one.  If I cared enough what Jim thought.  You know, do you realize the irony in me taking wardrobe criticism from you?  Ah, good.  Now you've got to give him credit for that one.  I can't even argue with it.  I'm an awful dresser.  Yes.  But I'm acknowledging I'm an awful dresser.  But see, yeah, Norton's not trying, though.  He doesn't care.  It seems like you've got something going on here.  I've got a look going.  You're trying for a look.  You really are trying for a look.  I don't care what Jim thinks of my look.  How does it feel that when you pull into a gas station, people run? 
[01:25:00]  I don't even know what that meant.  Because there's flames.  I got it.  Yeah, of course you did.  I carried the two.  I did the math problem.  That was good.  All right.  Just wait until you see the boots.  Are you really going to get the boots?  I already got them.  Not the ones I showed you last night.  They didn't have those on my side.  You've got to come in to work with the flaming boots.  Yeah, they are.  When are you moving to Chelsea, by the way?  They're shipped in from England.  He needs a roadster. 
[01:25:30]  He's the kind of guy that would drive a roadster with the flames on it.  Yeah, I would.  The look is perfect to get out of that.  We've got to get him on American Chopper.  Yeah, yeah.  You're perfect for American Chopper.  He's the type of guy you see holding hands with another guy, but not in one of those hardcore male fist clubs.  Oh, wow.  The type of guy.  I didn't see that coming.  The type of guys that shake hands like this.  How you doing?  And then kiss deep in the middle of the street.  Oh.  Oh.  I'm not knocking them.  I'm just saying that those. 
[01:26:00]  You ever see those guys?  Those are the gay guys that you don't know.  Yeah.  Anthony and I see those guys all the time.  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Where the fuck did you get that from?  You never saw the guys, the leather bar guys?  Only in that movie that Pacino was in, Cruisin'.  Oh, that was, yeah.  He wears the yellow handkerchief.  Yeah.  No, I just like watching.  You'd never get a laugh when we'd come out of BCN when we'd be broadcasting at BCN at the Ramrod.  Oh, right.  The Ramrod's across the street.  The Ramrod type of guy.  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  Thank God the Ramrod was there.  I'm sure Perenna loved that when he was working at BCN.  Hey, he's right across the street. 
[01:26:30]  Of course, they're a little too old for my liking.  Any PlayStation takers here?  Gotta love him.  All right, so the reason we brought Steve in...  Sorry, Steve.  Steve got this George Bush song, which is pretty amazing.  Yeah.  I don't have it in...  I mean, I have the song, but I don't have what you wrote down.  So what's this thing all about there, Steve?  Someone sent me an anonymous email with this...  Here it is.  No, go ahead.  Well, you just say it.  This remix of Sunday Bloody Sunday.  U2's Sunday Bloody Sunday. 
[01:27:00]  But whoever remixed it found audio from George Bush and perfectly synced it up.  to the lyrics.  Every lyric of the song...  It's spoken by George Bush.  It's spoken by George Bush.  Yeah, they cut up a bunch of his speeches.  Yeah, I mean, this is...  Just as someone who has done something like this before, that takes months to put that  together.  Yeah.  Because you've got to farm through hours and hours and hours of speech audio.  To get one word at a time.  To get one word at a time.  Found the exact lyrics of Sunday Bloody Sunday, and it's George Bush kind of doing, I don't  know, kind of like a spoken word or something. 
[01:27:30]  But there's a few times where the melody actually, the tone of his voice matches the melody  of the song.  Yeah, so...  I don't know if it matters or not, but I actually was trying to do the same thing, but I was  trying to do...  Here we go.  Jesus.  I can't even do it.  Oh, God.  Look at you.  Jesus.  Laughing.  I suck!  I was going to say Hitler doing supercalifragilisting.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Fuck.  What the hell did I get myself into?  Oh, well, I laughed through it like a rookie right now. 
[01:28:00]  Because that's very funny.  Oh.  Hey, we've got to get those eBay items, by the way.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  We'll do that after the George Bush song, but seriously, take a listen to this, man.  Somebody put a lot of work into this.  Two for Tuesday.  Yeah, it's George Bush kind of speaking Sunday Bloody Sunday, and it almost sounds like a  sing-along.  Here it is.  There's been a lot of talk about this next song.  This song is not a rebel song. 
[01:28:30]  This song is Sunday Bloody Sunday.  I can't believe the news today.  I can't close my eyes and make it go away.  How long?  How long?  We sing this song.  How long?  Too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Tonight.  Broken bottles under children's feet. 
[01:29:00]  Blood is thrown across the dead in streets.  But I won't need the battle hall.  It puts my back up.  It puts my back up.  It's the wall.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  And the battle's just begun. 
[01:29:30]  This many lost in town who has won.  The trenches dug within our hearts.  Mothers, children, brothers, sisters, one heart.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  How long?  How long?  Must we sing this song?  How long?  Too, too, too, too long.  Too long.  Tonight.  We can be as one.  Tonight.  Tonight. 
[01:30:00]  Tonight.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online.  The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember.  Park, park, dot, dot.  Wipe the tears from your eyes.  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your tears away. 
[01:30:30]  Wipe your tears away.  Wipe your shy eyes.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Let's roll.  And it's free, not only. 
[01:31:00]  One fact, fiction, and TV reality.  And today's news is fun.  We eat and drink while tomorrow they die.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  Sunday Bloody Sunday.  So I was in the grocery store, and there was this stock boy stacking melons. 
[01:31:30]  So I figured, hey, I'll show him some real melons.  Well, when I flashed him, he lost his balance, and the entire stack of melons came crashing down on him.  He was suffocated under two tons of melons, but my melons are...  I was listening to some rap music this afternoon.  Not that I had a choice.  It was coming out of a Jeep four miles away.  Yeah, can you turn that crap up?  I still have one eyeball left in the socket. 
[01:32:00]  It's good music.  It has a message.  Kill Whitey!  And white people are dancing to it.  I love this song.  It mentions my name twice.  I like rap, man.  I don't care when they mess with a turntable.  It sounds like a fat chick walking in corduroys.  Please welcome MC Chase. 
[01:32:30]  Remember, they call rap, they call scratching an art form.  Remember the old days?  You were at a party.  You bumped into the turntable.  You're an asshole.  Now you're a musical genius.  Is he drunk?  No, he's cutting an album.  F***!  F***!  F***!  Get away from the turntable, Bill.  F*** you, I'm good.  Give me a contract.  F***!  Now rappers are shooting each other, huh? 
[01:33:00]  Finally.  If we could just get the country and western people to join in,  it'll be a perfect world.  I'd hate to see Billy Ray Cyrus take a cap in the achy, breaky ass.  That would suck.  Boy, we wouldn't want to lose that talent, would we?  Rappers are shooting each other, it's getting crazy over music, man.  Remember the old days? 
[01:33:30]  There was a shooting, cops used to look through mug photos,  now they look through the R&B section in Tower Records.  So, uh, what's, uh, I need a vacation.  Obviously, I'm a tad stressed, and, uh...  You're driving.  This is your daily commute.  You tune in your XM radio.  You pay little attention, if any, to the road. 
[01:34:00]  You're approaching the Chesapeake Bay branch.  Suddenly, for no apparent reason, you pull the wheel strongly to the right.  Your car is pole vaulted into the air.  Gravity takes a hold, and you head to the water.  The impact is like concrete.  Then you slowly submerge.  Feeling the cold presence of wetness,  oxygen is slowly purged from your vehicle. 
[01:34:30]  And for a moment, you think to yourself,  Man, my XM radio sounds so good.  Man.  Man.  The Loft.  An XM 50.  The Loft is based around the beauty of songwriting and acoustic-based rock.  I don't wanna go uptown, baby.  Look at all the people like cows in a herd. 
[01:35:00]  Well, I like birds.  The Loft.  An XM 50.  You know, the door is always open,  so stop by and visit us at The Loft.  An XM 50.  When disaster's at your door,  XM's Emergency Alert is on your XM radio,  24-7 on Channel 24-7.  Floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, snowstorms,  and natural disasters. 
[01:35:30]  Are all a part of life.  You need information now.  XM delivers 24-7 on Channel 24-7.  XM's Emergency Alert Channel.  Information now.  I was walking down the street,  and some construction guy was shouting at me,  hey, show me your cans. 
[01:36:00]  So I did.  And he plummeted 17 floors,  and was impaled on a forklift.  But my tits looked great.  Please, wow responsibly.  A public service announcement of The O.P. & Anthony Show.  This is The O.P. & Anthony Show. 
[01:36:30]  Thanks for checking us out today.  Greatly appreciate it.  People are very, very confused out there.  Confused.  This is The O.P. & Anthony Channel.  We're making adjustments every day.  And we moved around the replay schedule.  And I think this one is going to stay for a while.  I think it makes more sense,  where pretty much, if you're on the East Coast,  you hear O.P. & Anthony from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. live.  Then we go right into the replay, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
[01:37:00]  This is all on the East Coast.  And then 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.  It seems to make more sense as far as, you know,  the commuters out there, okay?  Huh? When? What?  Well, people want to know,  because they thought there was a mess up.  No, this is going to be the replay schedule for a while.  And then what they do after that, I have no idea.  Honestly, I have no idea.  We're taking it one step at a time.  Let's say hi to Ben in Arizona.  Hey, Ben.  Hey, I just wanted to say it's good having you guys back on the radio again. 
[01:37:30]  And I was just curious.  Yesterday I was listening to Frenchie vs. Frenchie on the radio,  and all of a sudden you guys got cut out by Washington.  What the hell is up with that?  Yeah, we're still working on that.  There's like some kind of master computer down in Washington,  and we can't go past 10 yet.  And we're going to work on that  and make sure we end our show when we feel like ending it.  You missed a lot of great stuff, unfortunately,  because we just said screw it, and we just kept doing the radio show.  It'll be available on the box set version of the Opie and Anthony show.  Ah. 
[01:38:00]  When they put all that crap in the box set.  The lost tapes.  That no one wants to hear anyway.  Yes.  And I got one more question for you real quick.  Yeah.  I was, I originally learned about you guys through some bits that I heard online  of Frank Caliendo doing the John Madden.  Right, right.  I want to know if he's going to be back on, man.  He got me started doing the whole John Madden thing.  Now I do it everywhere.  Oh, you do John Madden, do you?  Well, he's a guy that, you know, when they're wanting to win, 
[01:38:30]  boom, tough-racking international, get rid of it.  So, Ben, you do John Madden.  That was a good Dr. Evil.  Now do John Madden.  Yeah, let's hear John Madden.  Well, he's a guy that when he puts his contacts in, he can see better.  I'll get you, Austin Powers.  Ben, when do we get to hear the John Madden?  Oh, no.  I got owned.  Ben does imitations. 
[01:39:00]  If sometimes you close your eyes, you would think it was the actual person.  No, I...  I can see how a girl could fall for you, Ben.  Thank you.  Yeah, I kind of didn't enjoy that, but thank you.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, it's all right, Ben.  It's fine.  Frank Caliendo will probably be back on the show when he realizes that we're back on the radio.  People still don't know we're doing a radio show yet.  It's going to take some time.  I think for this team to win, they need to score some touchdowns. 
[01:39:30]  One more, and then...  Scotty, don't.  What is this guy talking about in Philly?  Ellis, what's up?  Hey, what happened to the freedoms that you guys said you were going to have?  I know you just said you were going to try and get a little more of the show running,  you know, past schedule, but getting clipped just really, really blows.  The what?  You know, getting cut at the end of the...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  We know that blows. 
[01:40:00]  No, we understand that.  We just explained it.  Like, this is a work in progress.  I mean, I'm a long-time fan of you guys, man.  You know, it's just ridiculous that everything you guys said in the un-gag kind of isn't happening with...  What do you mean?  Run it your way.  No, that's not true at all.  What are you, crazy?  This is a work in progress.  Every day, you know, we're improving things.  We could come in here and discuss whatever we want on a daily basis, and we do.  The technical glitches...  Where in the interview that you heard did we say anything? 
[01:40:30]  There won't be any technical glitches.  Well, you know, that being said, I mean, you guys are great, and I'm really glad to have you back.  It's just kind of annoying when you guys just kind of get limited by Washington, that's all.  Well, it's growing pains.  We're working this out.  XM Satellite Radio, we are the pioneers.  We are the first big, huge radio show that was hired by XM Satellite Radio.  We invented it.  We invented it.  That's right.  That's right.  It was us that invented it.  And they're not used to this, you know? 
[01:41:00]  So we're learning as we go along.  I mean, we give these guys hell every day, but the fact is, the studio that Anthony and  I are sitting in, they built in like four days.  I would have done it first, but the government's after me, Robin, so I couldn't invent Satellite  Radio, because I was...  No, you're telling everyone that you're the innovator, though.  You're telling everyone you're the first to go to XM.  Yeah, but the truth of the matter is, I had to hide from the government, so I couldn't really  invent it.  I was on the grassy knoll.  So now you're admitting that you're not inventing this?  Is that someone did it before you? 
[01:41:30]  Well, not in public.  I'm not admitting it, but...  But behind the scenes, you're admitting that you were a little late, right?  I was a little late.  A little late, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, George Bush is after me, so...  Of course he is.  I don't have time to invent things like I used to, like walking.  I invented that.  One foot in front of the other.  That was me.  How much time are you going to spend on talking about Bush today on your show?  People just want to know.  How long is my show?  Four hours?  Four hours?  Well, sort of.  It's four hours, but it's probably about an hour and a half of actual material,  because the rest of the time is commercials. 
[01:42:00]  But yeah, it's a four-hour radio show.  I'll spend the whole show trying to get George Bush thrown out of office.  Oh, wow.  I look forward to hearing that today.  Again.  And again.  And again.  And again.  That's right, Robin.  Yeah, real smart move by the Doggy Company.  Hiring a guy that's going to be about 55 years old to take you guys out of the hole.  Yeah, that's real good.  Burr!  Burr!  I like the little dog, though.  It's such a cute little symbol to have for a company.  I always used it when I played Monopoly. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  The little dog.  I wouldn't mind the dog.  Maybe a little silver hat for your company.  I want the thimble.  Oh, I want to be the thimble.  Wait till you see what XM Satellite Radio does next.  What are they going to do next, Opie?  Oh, there's a big announcement today, and then there's a couple more right around the corner, I do believe.  With the thing, with the guy.  See, we're smart.  We picked the right company.  We had a choice.  We could have went to the dog company.  We said, ah-ah.  Do you know how many months I walked by Madison Square Garden and saw that serious ad and wondered, 
[01:43:00]  what the fuck does that mean?  Before, what is that?  It was just serious.  Turn regular radio off.  What?  It's a dog.  No, it...  What the...  Who the...  See, there was AM radio.  Then there was FM radio.  Now there's XM radio.  Absolutely.  Makes a lot more sense than just throwing a dog logo on TV and saying, hey, look what we're doing.  What?  Dog winking?  Do I see one dog eye?  I just hate it.  All right. 
[01:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  So you're not going to dinner tonight?  No.  Dude, come on.  Look.  Look.  This is a whole new lifestyle.  You gotta help me out, man.  No.  I'm sorry.  I do apologize.  I feel bad because I know how exciting Bob dinners are.  I know how thrill-a-minute, action-packed they are.  Our agent is flying in from L.A.  And my arms are killing me.  He's...  Ha, ha, ha.  He's working on some big deals for you and I, Anthony.  Yeah.  Has to fly in and we have to do our dinner. 
[01:44:00]  No.  We do dinner with our agent once every three months.  I'm drawing a line in the sand, Opie.  And you're blowing this one off.  He's in the air right now, flying in, just so he could take you and I to dinner tonight.  Fantastic.  And I won't be there.  You know something?  It's a complete change of lifestyle.  He cannot come flying in, winging into New York, and make a dinner appointment.  A little dinner date.  If he wanted to come for lunch, and maybe after the show at noon, we go grab a little bite 
[01:44:30]  or something, that's fine and dandy.  But I'm not going to hang out and wait until he flies in at five and then has to check  in at the hotel that we're paying for?  Oh, yeah, Bob.  How about you stay at a more expensive hotel?  Why don't you go to the St. Regis and have your suits ironed while we wait?  You know?  Why don't you go to the St. Regis?  Yeah, I did notice that he upgraded his life a little bit since...  He's like...  Since... 
[01:45:00]  Hi, guys.  It's Bob.  ...taking us on as clients.  Hi, guys.  It's Bob.  You want to meet me at the hotel?  Okay, Bob.  Where are you staying?  I'm staying at the gold-encrusted palatial hotel down at...  What?  Remember the...  Where each room is made of...  Everything is entirely made of gold?  Remember when we were in Boston and we met him at a hotel...  A hotel...  A airport restaurant.  Yeah.  It was a little stupid buffet place.  The food was awful.  It's because the pitch was coming.  We're not paying him 10% yet.  He had his wrinkled suit on and we said, all right, we'll go with this guy. 
[01:45:30]  Now, look.  He doesn't have wrinkled suits anymore and he's not taking us to little Chinese buffet places.  Now he's doing very well.  And we're thinking, hey, this is kind of cool.  Get a nice meal from the agent.  Wait a minute.  Yeah.  There's a reason why we're getting nice meals from the agent.  Because we're footing the bill.  Because in the end, we're footing the bill.  But he is a super agent and he makes some great deals and that's why we pay him.  But to have to go out to dinner, you know, lunch, all right, I'd suck it up and let's  go to lunch.  Because then I could get done with the show, hang out for a little while around here, have 
[01:46:00]  some fun, chat with the guys, and then at noon we go out and have some lunch.  I'm not going to sit around until he gets in at 5.  He's playing lands at 5?  Yes.  Yeah.  So dinner is until 7.38 at the earliest.  Oh, I can't do that.  See?  He says 6.  Oh, that's a lie.  No, it ain't going to be 6.  He always says an hour after his flight lands and it's never an hour after his flight  lands.  But I always look forward to you ordering something just completely outrageous.  I did that once. 
[01:46:30]  The 5-pound lobster.  I know.  That he has to tell everyone because you know it really, really hurt him.  Because it cost him like 300 bucks.  It really hurt him.  He's a great guy, but man, is he cheap.  Yeah, he's very cheap.  Oh, yeah.  Is he cheap?  I will get a receipt for a piece of bazooka bubblegum.  And he doesn't understand.  Like, he's trying to...  See, when it comes right down to it, Anthony and I are just dopey DJs.  Dopey DJs.  Never expected to make money doing this.  Just kind of wanted to do a radio show with our friends, see some boobs, and have a few 
[01:47:00]  laughs.  You didn't expect to take in a half billion, right?  Enough to pay the bills.  Half billion, I wish.  Half billion.  Wouldn't that be nice?  Are you kidding me?  You don't think we called Bob up immediately when we read that figure in the paper and  said, Bob, yeah, you're really doing a good job for us out there.  You know who makes more money than us?  Allison.  Allison.  My best friend, who I pay half my money to.  But, you know, I don't know.  Well, we'll get there someday, I guess.  One of these days.  I don't really care, quite frankly.  I have enough money, and that's all, you know.  But he's trying to, like... 
[01:47:30]  We'll get there, Pop.  Yeah.  Wasn't enough time.  He's trying to inject more responsibility in our lives.  He wants us to be smarter about our money.  Yeah.  He wants us to be smarter about our retirement.  I have a retirement plan.  401Ks.  I have a retirement plan.  It's called PartyPoker.com.  I love it.  I go on, I invest some money, and sometimes I hit.  Sometimes I don't, just like investments. 
[01:48:00]  You never know.  But this guy, our agent wants us to save receipts for everything.  Yeah.  Everything.  I drove around California with him once, and he was, like, asking receipts for receipts  for 75-cent tolls.  Yeah.  75-cent tolls.  Wow.  That's really going to add up.  They add up.  Hell yeah.  If you go through 1,000 of them.  Yeah.  75-cent tolls.  It could also, if there's ever...  Yeah, but to play devil's advocate, it could also, like, prove mileage, too.  If you have a toll from such and such a plaza, that means you had to drive through it.  I save receipts for everything.  Yeah, but he's saving it to...  He's saving it to... 
[01:48:30]  Trust me.  He's saving it for write-offs.  For deduction.  What do you think I save it to show my friends?  You saved home receipts?  You'd probably save him for alibis.  Look, I couldn't have killed the bitch.  I was here.  I went through this easy pass at 938 at night.  Of course.  All right.  So I'm supposed to go to dinner at, what, 8 o'clock.  He says 6.  And then the, you know, I'm sure there'll be thrilling dinner conversation, which will last  a couple of hours.  What's that, 10?  Well, don't you have your financial planning meeting today anyway? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  That's another thing.  He sets us up with, like, another guy, like, another Jewish lawyer that sits us down and  explains what we should do with our money, and we're just like, eh, eh.  See, without getting into any details or any boring corporate things, you're supposed to  take a certain amount of money, you have to, when you're incorporated, and put it into  a retirement account.  It's like a legal thing.  Such and such amount of money has to go aside for your, like, retirement thing. 
[01:49:30]  I call it a tax shelter.  Yeah, whatever.  I don't know.  I don't know what the F's going on.  Occasionally, I type in the bank that my money's in, and I look at the balance.  Dude, so we have to sit down with this financial planner.  Who can now discuss, he's going to take that little bit of money that goes to your retirement  thing and invest it to make it grow.  So, where after maybe 20 years, we'll, it'll grow, I don't know, maybe we'll make $2,000. 
[01:50:00]  I know.  It doesn't amount to anything.  It's like, why are you wasting my time?  First of all, you're speaking another language.  I have no, the stuff that Barry says to us, I'm like, what?  I know.  Speaking on a level I can understand, I have no idea what you're trying to tell me here.  Financial people are just bores.  It's like, just make sure I have enough money in my savings account when we blow up this radio  show again, where I could just go down to some island and live for a while.  That's all I care about.  I'm not crazy spend guy.  Believe me.  I put a lot of money away, but I don't put it in these investment things. 
[01:50:30]  I earn a crappy 1%, whatever it is, at the bank, and I just leave it in there.  Savings account?  Yeah.  You know, I'm not going to...  Well, that's where you make the most money right now.  Oh, because let me take some money and put it into a stock IPO that I got the privilege  of putting it in.  How far down is that piece of crap?  Well...  Hey, you have the privilege of getting in at 19 bucks a share.  What are we at today, Opie?  If you need to know, it's...  13?  13 and a half?  Yeah.  Ooh! 
[01:51:00]  I'm down...  How many shares did we buy?  I forget now.  A lot.  A lot.  I'm down at least 30 or 40,000.  This was supposed to be an honor for us.  It was an honor.  It wasn't even...  Hey, I got a stock tip.  It was an IPO.  It's when you get to get in on the stock before the general public can.  It's not doing well.  You get in early.  It's tanking.  Oh, this thing is just a disaster.  It was offered to us...  I'm not even going to say what the stock is.  It was offered to us by our own boss.  Why?  Because then maybe other people will buy it because it's a great buying opportunity right  now and we can make some money back. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  We have to fully disclose that we own it.  The Sasquahanna Hat Company.  But this guy talks about 401Ks.  The latest thing is, you know, I think you guys need wills.  Yeah.  I think you need wills.  I think you need life insurance.  Yeah, yeah.  Life insurance.  I'm a dopey DJ.  Just freaking put my money in the bank and leave me alone.  That's another thing.  I want a raging battle when I go.  I want people fighting.  I want family members that have had great relationships their whole life to be torn apart over money. 
[01:52:00]  Over my money.  A reality show has to be shot over your family.  Fist fighting over your cash.  I like that, too.  Kicking each other's ass.  Scraping and clawing for a five spot.  Hey, I like that.  Isn't it great?  I'm canceling my will meeting.  Right.  Definitely.  I'll leave my money to my parents.  My dad has to have sex with a black prostitute while my mom is in the other room and not  find out about it.  Oh, God.  That's fantastic.  And then he gets the money?  Wouldn't that be great?  Oh, that's beautiful.  And he can never tell her. 
[01:52:30]  As they're both crying, I have to do this.  That's beautiful.  I miss him.  And my picture has to be on the wall.  A little wink.  A little wink.  A little stinky wink.  That's beautiful.  I like that.  Oh.  Oh, I heard that.  By the way, speaking of reality shows, I think of the subject.  They're canceling the other CEO reality show?  Oh, that one with the other billionaire guy?  It's not my big and fat obnoxious boss, is it?  No, no.  That looks good.  It's the one with Mark Cuban?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mark Cuban's really...  I met him.  He's a cool guy. 
[01:53:00]  Trump sent him off a letter that's just like, I knew this was going to happen.  Yeah.  Kind of a ha-ha.  I guess the show's a disaster, but...  And by the way, just to correct you, the other one doesn't look good.  My big, fat, obnoxious boss...  It definitely looks good.  It looks awful.  Who are the mutants that actually believe these things these days?  Like, you know there's the reality shows and then the goofs on reality shows?  And the people that are on the goofs on reality shows, they still think they're on a reality show?  Do they honestly believe that it's a serious show when the CEO of a company is shooting you with paintballs 
[01:53:30]  and you're trying to put a piece of paper through a copy machine?  I know.  I was laughing at that, too.  I thought it was ridiculous.  Did you see the boss at a cocktail party and he's supposed to be boss-like and stuff and they're talking business  and all of a sudden he looks at one of the redheads, I think, and goes,  Boy, you're hot.  Yeah.  I'm going to watch.  I'll watch at least one episode to see what it's all about.  The only one I want to see is the Richard Branson one.  That's a reality show.  If you can plummet to your death in the middle of it, I like it.  Someone will get killed doing one of these reality shows, and that one looks like the one they're... 
[01:54:00]  But I like him.  He's great.  Yeah, but what's the deal with that?  They're going to go over the falls in a barrel, that one in...  What falls is that?  It's like...  What do they say?  It's like four times higher than Niagara Falls, whatever.  Really?  I got all my freaking...  Oh, that would be...  I almost made a great fan reference.  But they show them in the barrel.  They show them in the barrel.  They have a camera inside the barrel with one of the contestants, and they're going to go over this falls.  Stop.  That's what it looks like.  They're really going to shove them over falls. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  The reason it doesn't work in Niagara Falls is because they have all those rocks below, so I'm wondering...  Plenty of rocks.  I'm wondering if this one, there's nothing below except water.  I bet you there's some kind of crane that catches it or something like that.  Maybe.  They always put a safety harness on it and ruin it, like on Fear Factor, when they have  to jump from the car trunk to another car, dangling like hundreds of feet in the air.  Ah, they put a harness on it.  I can't even watch Fear Factor anymore.  I can't even watch that.  No.  The eating stuff, cannot watch.  I cannot watch people eat live, hissing cockroaches as they're... 
[01:55:00]  They can't even put it in their mouth because the thing is biting their lips and clawing at their faces.  Can't watch it.  Ugh.  Eating testicles.  Well.  Yeah.  Monster Rain.  Oh, ho, ho.  Fear Factor Monster Rain Edition.  I'm so afraid of heights.  I was reading...  There's a French guy who dresses up in a Spider-Man costume.  Oh, yeah.  I saw that.  Nice and snug, so it's uncut, awful member shows.  Yes.  And he...  He climbs buildings.  Without rope.  Yeah.  It's all with his bare hands and little dirty French feet. 
[01:55:30]  And I'm reading...  I'm looking at these pictures.  George Willing lives.  Yeah.  George Willing and the other guy, Spider-Dan, used...  They used equipment.  This guy has hands and chalk on his hands.  Uh-huh.  And that's it.  And he climbed the Sears Tower.  Um, and I was reading pictures.  I'm looking at pictures.  I'm sweating.  My hands are sweating.  It's horrifying.  You're...  You have a fear of heights?  Horror.  Yeah.  Of heights.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't do well with heights either.  Oh, my.  Uh-huh.  You get that feeling you just want to jump over?  Yeah.  Especially when you're halfway through that story and you realize there's nothing interesting 
[01:56:00]  at the end of the tunnel.  Well, that's what...  You're just talking for no reason.  You're like, and I really don't like heights.  Please let something of human interest pop into my fat head.  Who gives a shit if you don't like heights?  Stupid.  God, what a goalless nothing I learned.  Your eyes were spinning like a slot machine.  You were trying to come up with something.  Well, I knew that the concept of watching this guy was really frightening to me, but I'm  like, why would a radio audience care about that?  That's something you tell someone on an eight-hour car ride.  I think people that are scared of heights got something out of that.  Yeah, both of them.  Even they think it's boring. 
[01:56:30]  Because, I mean, you know, actually, a guy did do this at Columbus Circle, that new building.  The Time Warner building?  Yeah.  The Time Warner building.  It goes up about, what is it, about five or six stories?  Well, no.  There's an area where it goes up five or six stories and you can look out over the lobby.  It's creepy.  And it's just a glass wall that, I swear, it's barely above your waist.  Yeah, it looks like you could hip-check someone walking and send them right over.  Well, a guy decided to buy it because that's the latest craze here in New York City is jumping 
[01:57:00]  from heights.  They love jumping.  And a guy jumped during lunch and then splattered on the...  Five stories?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, five or six.  On the inside of the building?  Yeah, he jumped on the inside.  What a mess.  Remember when we played the gag on Earl?  Yeah.  Yeah, right from there.  All inside the Time Warner building, those two gigantic in Columbus Square, 57th Tower,  or the apartment buildings.  They're massive.  And there's a big atrium in between them with shops.  Is that where you're at?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Where Patty works.  Exactly.  And you could go up five or six stories of shops everywhere and then you could go to  the edge. 
[01:57:30]  And I swear, the glass wall is barely above your belly button.  I can move into one of those places.  Yeah, sure you are.  I couldn't even stand there.  I didn't even like it.  When we were down there, we played a joke on Earl.  We had Earl come in and we were trying to talk to him.  But you don't have enough...  You know, I don't know.  It's too low.  What was the joke?  You guys all wore white hoods and chased him?  Oh.  No, but I couldn't even stand next to the edge.  I was too freaked out.  Yeah.  They'll put something up now that somebody's killed themselves there.  I know.  He ruined it for everyone.  Yeah.  Ah, school bus into a house in Staten Island.  Very good.  There's more accidents in the morning. 
[01:58:00]  I've noticed that.  Well, we got a plane crash today and a school bus accident.  See?  Don't worry, moms.  Looks like everyone's okay.  By the way, they won't put up protectors.  They never did in the Marriott on Broadway.  And people have been 50 stories or 45 stories indoors.  And people have been jumping inside of there for years.  Thinning the herd.  Yeah.  I'm not a big fan of heights.  But when I was working in construction, I used to have to do some stupid stuff on ladders.  And one time I had a big extension ladder up against a building.  I'm climbing up it. 
[01:58:30]  And they always told you, when you climb up, take either vice grips and fasten the ladder  to the building or a rope and tie it off to a stack on top of the building or something.  It was a windy day.  Get climbing up there.  The wind hit the side of the ladder and it starts falling.  F that.  And you're about almost 40 feet in the air.  And this thing starts tipping over sideways.  No way.  I go to straighten it out.  I finally catch it.  Straightens out.  The latch that holds the extension part of the ladder wasn't fastened. 
[01:59:00]  It goes, and I'm riding the thing down as it's snapping.  Hits the edge of the roof.  And now there's no more roof.  Slides down the building.  I fall into the hedges.  Fall right into the hedges.  And this used to happen a lot.  Like if people are in construction, they've had ladder mishaps all the time.  It's frightening.  And nothing else.  Were you sweating, Jim?  Because I was.  I have a...  I'm sorry, in that story?  No, I definitely understand the fear of falling off a ladder.  Thank God you weren't walking under one. 
[01:59:30]  That could be bad luck.  Ho, ho, ho.  I have a fear of spiders, everybody.  Do you really?  There's a great movie about that called arachnophobia.  Remember that one where the big spiders were attacking people?  You remember that?  Yeah, that was really good.  All right.  We got some more items up on eBay.  Oh, we do?  Items up for bid?  Yeah.  You put Opie and Anthony into eBay.com.  Some funny things are starting to pop up.  All right.  Who's putting these up?  They're great.  I mean, there's a lot of our old shows and stuff that people are selling. 
[02:00:00]  And they're even selling our new shows here on XM Satellite Radio.  But this guy put up an item for bid.  It's Opie and Anthony, of course.  Opie's Week 1 Sickly Underwear Artwork.  What's the bid up to?  Oh, the starting bid, one cent.  One cent.  You are bidding on artistic interpretation of Opie's Week 1 Jockeys for the opening bid of one cent. 
[02:00:30]  Are you a true fan of Opie and Anthony?  If you are, this is the one item you cannot do without.  Be the first of your tool friends to own this one-of-a-kind piece of obscure reference memorabilia.  This masterful work of art was done to commemorate a very sickly Opie's underwear from Week 1's broadcast on XM Radio.  Own this artistic rendition of a pair of boxer briefs that were worn by a sick, feverish person and hadn't been changed in a week.  That's not true.  Every day I was making new artwork.  Hand-drawn by renowned local New Jersey artist Pablo Pick My Ass. 
[02:01:00]  Suitable for framing, on a refrigerator with magnets.  Mediums used, paper, marker, barbecue sauce.  Testimonials.  It looked like a used shoeshine rag, says Opie.  It stinks and I don't like it, little Jimmy says.  Opie, you're the talented one.  Dave Dickless Douglas.  That's not what he said.  Mary Kate's the prude.  Ashley's the goer.  That's Anthony Cumia.  And Bruce, our old boss, just says,  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-boys. 
[02:01:30]  And Ben, hee-hee-hee-hee-hee.  And is that about it for this one?  Yeah.  Okay, then it's all the official stuff to get on eBay.  But there it is.  The artist's rendition of my sickly underwear.  Artist's rendition.  That's pretty funny.  Lovely.  And then there's another item up for bid, Ant?  Yes.  Which one is that?  I don't think I have it in front of me.  The Opie and Anthony Monster Rain Rain Coat.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Rain Coat with .0005 mils of Monster Rain on each coat. 
[02:02:00]  Gem Mint people, be dialing.  This is your chance to own a Monster Rain Rain Coat.  The wetter the better is the way to play Monster Rain.  With the new technology that XM has obtained, this jacket has the highly desirable Shwoogie  filter that is in such demand.  I don't know what that means. 
[02:02:30]  And you suck.  Love you, little Jimmy.  Nick from Philly.  I like the picture of the Monster Rain Rain Coat.  I haven't seen that.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  It's got a hood on it and long sleeves.  A little hood.  It protects you from any Monster Rain that might be falling.  A little hoodie.  Can I see the picture?  Sure.  That's good for radio, but...  This item might be a little obscure, Anthony.  Thanks, Bob.  We could try it, though.  For the New York people.  All right, Opie and Anthony, the Bob Buckman Confessions.  You are bidding on a very rare, secretly taped session with radio legend Bob Buckman, 
[02:03:00]  formerly Opie's boss at WBAB in Babylon, Long Island.  In this new multi-platinum box set, you hear Bob encourage the union of Opie and Anthony.  You also hear him helping out Opie's nighttime attitude.  With bits like, things that really piss me off, and the middle of the show, fake-o.  And you also hear how Bob arranged WWE-style challenges of Opie versus WRCN's Captain Kevin.  Be dialing, people.  Be dialing.  Did I used to compete against a guy named Captain Kevin? 
[02:03:30]  I don't even know.  I guess so.  Also included are taped confessions from people who stole amplifiers and cymbal stands from  Anthony's band, Rotgut, as the band tried to figure out how to pay for its liquor tab.  Listen to the incredible large number of people try out to be Mr. Potato Heads.  Or any one of the thousand incarnations of Rotgut.  Wow.  How does this guy know so much?  Also hear how a crack record-producing team stopped recording mogul Joe Kumi of Sushi Records 
[02:04:00]  from singing then unknown Nirvana to a multi-year recording and touring deal.  Oh, signing.  Oh, signing.  Sorry.  Buy now and receive bonus recordings of now Middle Country Road.  Jiffy Lube Manager Leslie Gold openly and freely speaking about how Opie got her fired  from WNEW and how it was originally her idea for WNEW to use a double dong as an antenna.  What?  Listen to how ONA progressed from the barnacle-infested tender trap to the lush couches of scores. 
[02:04:30]  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  We never went to scores.  Never.  Privilege.  There's a strip club of choice for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  I'll still go to the Long Island Dives.  All right.  Like the tender trap.  That one started out good, but...  Lost energy.  Yeah, lost energy.  Sorry about that.  We need a...  I think we need a strip club that's closely associated with this radio program, if I may.  All right.  Of course you think that.  You got an idea?  No, I just wanted to throw that out there.  Just talk to Earl.  For what?  Earl goes to Privilege like every night. 
[02:05:00]  Every single night.  Exactly.  He does him no good.  He goes in there with a lonely idiot with a black trench coat.  Just sits there and sulks like a creep in the corner.  Hurry.  Hurry.  Hurry.  That guy's a 35-year-old virgin.  He's the only guy with cash that will creep out a stripper.  I'd rather not have money than take his and just look at him.  I think he just watches, or does he get the lap dances?  He gets lap dances.  Oh, he does?  A lap dance, please?  Oh, okay.  How exciting that's got to be for a girl.  Hey, who's this?  Stupid black cap on his head.  Who's this?  Because they didn't put your name down. 
[02:05:30]  Hey, guys.  This is Brad.  What's happening?  Hi, Brad.  What do you got, Brad?  Just real quick, I've got to let you know, I've been a big fan when you guys were on NEW.  I actually had Sirius, and when I went to the press conference in New York, I switched  over to XM the next day.  I just wanted to let you know that.  There you go.  Oh, thank you, sir.  Thank you.  You made a fine choice.  I also want to compliment Jimmy Norton on his Susquehanna Hat Company reference.  Thank you very much.  Very good.  Growing up in Canada watching SCTV, not a lot of people understand that reference. 
[02:06:00]  Is that what it's from, Jimmy?  No, it's Mabin Costello, you little angel.  Okay, well, hold on.  Well, then, because Martin Short, they used to do skits, and Martin Short would be Jamie  Farr, and that was his thing.  They did a whole skit on the Susquehanna Hat Company, but now I feel like an ass.  I'm sure they used it from Mabin Costello.  Mabin Costello is where it's from.  Every time the guy heard the word Susquehanna Hat Company, they would break the hat and  cry and cause a big to-do.  Right, and that's what they did on SCTV, which I thought was fantastic. 
[02:06:30]  It is, but it's a play on the old Mabin Costello sketch.  All right, Brad, thank you.  How was that one SCTV sketch, the guys from Canada meet Frankenstein?  Was that a good one?  They shamelessly ripped off Mabin Costello, those Canucks, those thieving Canadians.  We're big fans of the obscure references on the Opie and Anthony show.  I like that bit they do.  Who's on first, eh?  I like that one.  All right, well, nah, we won't do any more.  Who's crossing the blue line? 
[02:07:00]  Eh?  You can hang up on everybody.  Hang up on everyone over there.  Get rid of all the calls, Opie said.  Joe from Jersey wants to know if Billy Joel's driving that bus that crashed into the house.  Oh, yes.  You know, there's going to be a lot of parents out there panicking.  The bus went through the fence, but it didn't really crash into the house.  So far, they've only pulled out one little lifeless lump.  So chances are it's not yours.  That's not true.  Wait, was your kid wearing jeans and little cartoon sneakers?  I saw them yank something wearing that out the window. 
[02:07:30]  Jesus.  Little teenage ninja sneakers.  Still flashing little red lights on the back like he was walking.  Little red lights.  One light flashing, one dead.  Like the Terminator eyes.  One is still flickering.  Although there's...  God.  Let's get out of this mess.  I'm having a good time.  We're still trying to figure out if we can play the AIDS song.  I mean, we know we can play it.  We're just trying to weigh how much trouble we're going to get in.  And we just started this gig, so we've got to kind of be a little careful, I guess, right? 
[02:08:00]  So we're still waiting for them to call us back.  It's from Team America.  This song is hilarious, and I want to play it today.  Little video game news for people that have eagerly been awaiting, like I have for years.  Breaking video game news, Opie.  Half-Life 2, one of the year's most anticipated titles, will go on sale worldwide November 16th.  Nice.  November 16th.  You like Half-Life?  Half-Life's a great game.  What is Half-Life?  One of the best games.  That's the one where Gordon Freeman, you play the guy that was in this complex, and there was an accident in one of these big reactors, 
[02:08:30]  and you go around killing Marines that are trying to keep everything quiet.  And these alien creatures that have transported in because of the accident.  Great game.  One of the first real story-based first-person shooters with really great graphics.  And it was supposed to be out about a year ago, but some 18-year-old kid stole the...  Stole the code.  The game code.  Yeah, stole the game code, broke in, hacked into their computers. 
[02:09:00]  And they threw it all over the internet, kind of, so they had to pretty much redo the whole game.  When he stole the code, what does that do to the release of the game?  What happened?  In this case, it stopped it.  They couldn't release the game.  Why?  Security breaches.  Because the guy had to have the code to the game.  What's that mean if you have the code?  What can you do?  I don't know what that means in computer talk.  I think you can pretty much bootleg the game on the internet, right?  Yeah.  Or versions of it, or, you know, yeah.  Yeah, or you could find ways to screw with the game when you're playing online, probably 
[02:09:30]  get into other people's computers through it.  It's just not...  It was a disaster for the company.  Were they mad?  Oh, man.  They actually got the FBI involved, and it was kind of cool.  They got their own fans involved to try to hunt this kid down.  And they found him.  He was like an 18-year-old kid, just thought it would be cool to see what he could do.  Did they originally get the FBI hurt?  At first, they sent a trainee.  Here we go.  I'm trying to ask for the trainee. 
[02:10:00]  So, did they get the code back?  No.  No, no.  At that point, it was too late.  They just had to redo the whole game.  That stinks, right?  Yeah, and that's taken quite a while, but everyone's looking forward to this one.  So, are they suing this kid for a lot of money?  Probably.  Probably.  Why does this guy's name have to be Henry?  Why, God?  Why?  Hey, Henry.  Henry!  What's up, boys?  How are you?  You guys rock.  All right.  Got a question for you.  Henry, I want my money. 
[02:10:30]  Fuck him, that cigarette hijacking Mick.  I want my money, Henry.  What, am I a schmuck on wheels?  Get your shine box.  What's that?  Get your shine box.  No, I didn't mean to interrupt you, man.  I just got to get a Danish for Bell.  Go ahead.  Hey, how come the brainiacs in Washington can't automatically send people a wow sticker when  they sign up?  I don't understand that either.  They're too busy at press conferences here in New York to fill your envelope with the  wow sticker. 
[02:11:00]  Oh, man.  We are what they call on the back burner at this point, I think.  That's always good.  Two and a half weeks in.  We need a, I don't know, we got to wake them up a little bit.  We're doing things a little differently than they have in the past at XM Satellite Radio.  We wanted the wow stickers out there a month ago, and there was no reason why we couldn't  get the wow stickers out there a month ago.  We'll learn them.  We came up with this system where you just go to opianthony.com, you leave your address,  and they're supposed to mail out the wow stickers.  But I did find this out.  They're collecting all the names on the list before they start sending them out. 
[02:11:30]  It's like, no, just hire an intern to just stuff envelopes every day.  Right.  I signed up as soon as you guys said that.  Like, why does everything have to take meetings, and there's a process that has to be put in  place?  Just do it.  Can I answer?  Because I said, look, Anthony and I will pay for a P.O. box here in New York City.  We'll just get a big P.O. box.  We will.  Speak for yourself.  How much do those things go for?  I have a meeting with my financial guy this afternoon.  I'll ask him if I can swing that.  It's got to be at least $40. 
[02:12:00]  And we said, we'll get the P.O. box.  We've got some great interns around here, and we'll do it ourselves.  We'll do everything ourselves.  You know?  There you go.  We don't need to go to Washington to take these breaks.  We can do all that from here.  Grassroots, Opie.  Well, that's what we've always been about.  So why are they involved?  We'll lick our own stamps.  That's what the company says.  We kind of wanted the wow stickers out on the highways before, I don't know, it starts  snowing.  When it's snowing and crappy out, it's not really inducive to girls flashing their boobs.  It's not inducive, nor is it conducive. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, brother.  I did it again.  No, no, no, no, no.  I'm just saying.  It's not inducive, whatever that means.  Oh, God.  I'm 0 for 2.  I've never heard that word before.  Oh, right.  I'm sure it's not conducive with wowing either.  Oh, my God.  It's just really an envelope in the whole situation.  Hold on.  The person with the same, oh, I can't think of the word.  Shit.  At least I try to make up words.  I'm not saying it's bad.  I'm the worst today.  When you swallow something that's bad for you, do you conduce vomiting? 
[02:13:00]  What?  Well, it's not inducive.  Go ahead.  Oh, forget it.  Well, I don't know.  I don't know what we can tell you about the wow stickers, Henry.  By the way, you might recognize Opie's vocabulary if you spoke to the hooker from Full Metal Jacket.  Put him on hold, you're saying?  All right.  You guys rock.  We're going to put you on hold, and we'll personally send you a wow sticker.  I guess that's what we're going to have to do.  Or I'll hang up on you, and now you've got to call back.  Sorry about that.  No.  Let's go to Karen in Illinois.  Hey, Karen. 
[02:13:30]  Hello.  What's going on today?  Hi.  Not a whole batch.  All right.  Illinois, huh?  Why are you calling the show today?  Because my husband told me to.  I like that.  Nice.  Look at our obedience.  That means you're going to be naughty for us, right?  Yes, I will.  What do you want to do today?  What do you want me to do today?  Oh, boy.  Why?  Will you do anything?  Pretty much.  All right.  Well, you're from Chicago.  No, I'm not from Chicago. 
[02:14:00]  Where are you from?  Southern Illinois.  Oh, Southern Illinois.  I'm not from Chicago.  Sorry.  Can we play a game of Guess What's in My Trousers?  Okay.  My trousers.  Well, there's a few things.  You know, there's couples that feel like having sex live on the air.  That's kind of fun.  So far, Tennessee is leading that category.  Jag off.  Tennessee is the sexiest state so far.  Having sex on the air?  We're going to do our own poll.  We're going to try to find out the sexiest state.  Is your cellar there?  So far, it's Tennessee. 
[02:14:30]  We had a couple screw live on the air, and we had that girl that took a vibrator to herself.  Because she's a big fan of Jim Norton, and she pleasured herself live on the show in front of her husband for Jim Norton.  So, Tennessee is leading the way.  Wait, miss.  Tennessee, the sexiest state in America.  Is your fellow there, is he?  Yes, he is.  How about this?  We haven't had this yet.  I think it would be fun, and I'm not speaking for the guys, just for me, but I'd like to hear a hummer on the air.  While sex is nice, but a hummer has those distinctive sounds that are just really, really inducive with feeling good. 
[02:15:00]  Okay.  Are you into that?  Yeah.  We have to hear it, don't forget.  Maybe a little spitting, wink, wink, elbow to the ribs.  Okay.  And where is the husband?  He's right here in front of me.  Nice.  All right.  And is he naked?  He is now.  Yeah.  Now it's he.  Except for a smile.  Got to put it that way.  All right.  And is he a fever junk?  Yeah.  Is there anything going on down there?  Mm-hmm.  Big nasty, like peeling a fruit roll up off your thigh. 
[02:15:30]  You can talk to us while you're taking care of business, by the way.  That would be very nice.  Would you rather him talk while I'm taking care of business?  I'd rather hear nobody talk.  I just want to hear the sloppy sounds of his happiness.  Yeah.  Now make sure.  You got to moan.  No, just no.  That would be faking it.  No, I mean little-like things so we could hear the tone.  You got to hear that heady, heady tone.  Ooh.  Wow, look at these guys go at it. 
[02:16:00]  Please gag on it.  You're looking for the gag, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  That's nice.  Do you want me to completely finish? 
[02:16:30]  Is he there?  Is he close?  Sure, go ahead.  Is he close?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, let's give it the old college try, all right?  Mm-hmm.  Let's listen in.  Let's listen in.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.

[02:27:00]  on it  this is true  I wouldn't  have to even  gag yourself  god damn it  with my cock  the prime's  cock name's  Charlene  sir  Leonard talks  to his cock  happy birthday  dear ball bag  I was  I would lay  back and she  would come over  and she would  gag herself on  it and she  likes to like  eat ice cream  before she does  it because she  likes to kind  of puke a little  bit  oh my goodness  and I actually  have a bucket  that I would  bring out 
[02:27:30]  whenever she'd  come over  listen to this  now I'll be  this is why  I asked Jim  and uh  alright  she would uh  she liked  her favorite  thing was to  lay on her back  and I would  straddle her  and kind of  pin her arms  and kind of  gag her like  that so she  couldn't stop  me  um  right  and we had  the bucket  right by the  side of the  couch  so if I  pushed it in  too far  she could  lean over  and puke up  ice cream  oh yeah  um  one time  one time we  had like  lasagna or  something  and there  was some  awful sauce 
[02:28:00]  puke  I don't  I'm not  into vomit  I don't  have a  roman shower  oh it  sounds like  roman shower  he knows  the name  of it  but um  god  dude it's  it's  the hot  part is though  it's like  when she  gags  and like  just like  you know  the hot  part is  what's  coming out  all over  your thigh  lasagna  there is  um  I even wrote  her name  on the  bucket  this is true  it was her  own little  bucket  I'm not gonna  say her name  you're so  can we put  this bucket  up on ebay  Norton's 
[02:28:30]  chick's  puke bucket  her name  was Lori  I actually  wrote Lori's  bucket on it  and she  loved it  when she  came over  I put it  out  what girl  wouldn't  and she  would just  kneel down  and just  gag herself  it was so  hot  some girl  like the  gift of  Tiffany's  as a  little gift  but no  where did  you get  this bucket  from  it was in  the beyond  department  thank you  it's a  pleasure to  be here  it was  I love  Jay  I really

[02:29:30]  when you're doing  it or why  gagging sounds  like over the  phone  like if they're  doing it over  the phone  is a turn on  because that is  it's you know  a turn on  I think if I  heard a girl  gagging on the  phone it's a  turn on because  it just seems  like she can't  get enough  she's just like  I need more  she needs more  yeah  needs more  she's just  trying to get  her greedy  mouth all the  way down  the shaft  and she just  can't gobbling  greedy  I hope that  helped out

No  Oh, yeah  I'm sure he's not  He's not going to admit that  Oh, Jimmy  He's a beautiful girl, though  Jimmy's packing  She's beautiful  All right, so she says that you're 5'4  Does she know what you just did? 
[02:39:30]  Yes  Did she listen to the radio?  No, she just listened to us  Can I say that you're my favorite family ever?  Wait, wait  She was able to hear you guys doing that?

I don't know  I'm usually never home  Does Daddy wear  Does Dad wear robes around the house all the time?  No  All right, be careful  I'm being very  This is one thing you got to be really careful about  Did you hear what they were doing?  Even on satellite radio  No  Oh, you didn't hear what they were doing?  I thought you heard what was going on 
[02:40:30]  Well, I did  But I didn't really stay  Yeah, I wouldn't have either  But you knew what was going on, right?  Yeah  All right, this is going to lead into hot teen news, I think  Do you have any news that's hot?  No, no, no  You know what?  I'm getting nervous, man  Yeah, of course  All right, where's Mom?  Let's talk to Mom  All right  I know where the line is  I know you do  Trust me, I know you do  Jimmy does  Please  Look at him  He was  You know  All right  Put Mommy back on the phone  Jesus  Okay, I'm back 
[02:41:00]  All right  Yeah, everyone is saying that you sound hot  So what do you look like, Karen?  What do I look like?  Yeah  I'm probably not as hot as they think  Who cares?  Do you know something?  If that is a stepfather  Pardon me?  If that's a stepfather  Uh-huh  And she's like  Is she cute, like you say?  She's beautiful  He's definitely looking at her in a special way  Well, I, you know, I don't know really about that  No, no, it doesn't matter  No, no, no  He's a 10-year-old  He is  See, we're guys  This is, we  He's looking 
[02:41:30]  There's no way he isn't looking and going like, wow  Wow, I got a hot stepfather  If she's, you know  If she's budding  It doesn't mean anything bad  Like, he's not going to swan dive into her hamper  But, you know, sometimes you just take little peeks  You know, put the underwear on your head  And dance around when you're alone in the house  That's pretty much what she does, though  Nice  But she's very filled out  And she's got a body that most people would die for  Even at her age  Really?  Do you have any family pictures that we could take a look at? 
[02:42:00]  You know, maybe you guys at the Grand Canyon or something  Family website we can click on and enjoy your pictures  Maybe pictures you took during the holiday  Maybe a nice family website that you changed the address on  Because the FBI keeps closing in  No, we don't have a whole lot of pictures like that  The ones we do, we keep under wraps  Ah, alright  She's probably searched the house and found them, you know  So Karen is going to openly admit that she's not the hottest girl in the world  Although for radio it really doesn't matter  But you want to guess 
[02:42:30]  I think we should guess what's wrong with Karen  What's wrong with Karen?  I wouldn't put it that way, Opie  I don't think that's the right way to put it  What does Karen feel makes her not say she's hot?  But I want to guess and see if it matches up  It's a little match game  I love Karen  No, we love Karen  It doesn't mean we can't have fun with her in this way  Oh, good point, good point  Oh, good point  Okay, well  I could guess  But it would ruin everyone else's guess 
[02:43:00]  How many kids have you had, Karen?  How many?  Yeah  I have had four  And how many different fathers?  One  They're all by the same one  Alright, four  What are they?  Guys, girls, what?  Three boys and a girl  Three boys and a girl  And how old are they?  Yeah  17 to 13  17 down to 13?  Okay  Wow  That's a busy couple years  Okay, it's obvious what's wrong  I  Alright  So you're 5'3  I don't think you're overweight  I'm not going to say you're overweight  Just a little bit  I was going to say that 
[02:43:30]  I was going to say  Yes, she's got a few pounds on her  I'm going to say  What's wrong with Karen  Is that  Her body looks like  There's a midget inside  Trying to punch her way out  Oh  No  A midget  Sheepers  What?  Think about it  I don't get that  Yeah, you should get that  Midget inside  Trying to punch  His or her way out  Sure, why not?  What, some unsightly bulges  Here and there?  There's all sorts of things going on  That's alright  She just drank mule juice on the air 
[02:44:00]  I know  I like  Good girl  Her husband's a fine egg too  She was the silly goose to call back  She left us alone  I want to hear what's in my pants  Okay  Alright, make sure you lift up that bunt  Not that big  She don't have a bunt  No  No, I do not  Alright  Alright, so we're gonna  We're gonna play  Guess what's in Karen's pants?  With Cassie  No?  No  I might be able to talk her into it 
[02:44:30]  Oh, Jesus  No, no, no, no, no, no  You know what?  Trust me  Regardless of how incredibly hot that sounds  Wait till we're not from the planet Earth  It's highly illegal  And then we'll be able to play that  Highly illegal  When we move our radio show to a space shuttle  Then we'll play that  Oh, it moves to the Middle East  They can start playing at 9, apparently  You know, I'd like to make a comment right now  Yes  This is the answer to the question everyone asks  What is it that would get you thrown off of satellite radio?  Right 
[02:45:00]  Here it is  Here's the opportunity  We have the opportunity in our hands right now to screw this up again  Completely blow it up  To blow it up again  Two and a half weeks  To make the news again  To be out of work again  We have the opportunity right in our palms right now  And look at what we're doing  We're on a pond and the ice is very thin  Very thin  And we're taking a little too many steps forward here  And regardless of how hot that phone  Rubbing on that fine, wispy hair would sound  No can do 
[02:45:30]  No can do  I think we need to just hang up on Karen  Regardless of how tight that would sound  Rubbing  Yeah  Should we hang up on Karen?  Wow, are you rubbing that over the eyes of a Chinese woman?  All right, listen  We should hang up on Karen  We're going to let it go  I think we could do that with Karen  Why not?  We can do it with Karen  She's an adult  Karen's an adult with a married woman  Of course  And her husband is present  All right, can you go lock up your daughter, please? 
[02:46:00]  I'll lock my door  Yeah, if she's in the room  Don't even tell us  Because we don't want to know  No, she's not here  All right, she's not there  You're in your room  She's playing with her coloring books  Barbie dolls  And you're ready to play  Guess What's in My Pants  With the Opie and Anthony crew, right?

Uh, just a little  That's fine  Did they all come from C-section?  Uh-huh  I like that  Hey, why don't we guess this  The scar  Yeah, guess what the scar  And how long the scar is  She could rub the phone over  Well, not as hot  Nowadays, the scars are a lot smaller 
[02:47:00]  Are they?  Oh, yeah  I've seen some strippers  That have had the C-section  At the strip clubs  And you sit there  And it kind of takes you out of it  Yeah, it's like  Who did that for you, Leatherface?  Holy shit  All right, so what we'll do is  We're going to have you rub the phone  Up and down  Side to side  And then circular motion  We'll talk you through this whole  You know  Process  Progress  What did you almost say?  Progress  We'll talk you through the whole progress  I swear to God  It wasn't progress  You know, that would have made sense too  And using the progress of elimination 
[02:47:30]  We will determine  Oh my God  I can't believe I have to think  Before a word comes out now  How pathetic  Well, the show is, you know  It's processively getting better  All right  Some instant feedback is coming in  Guys, make history  Get kicked off after only three weeks  No, no, no  And we're showing responsibility  Chris from PA  I'm supposed to read that from here?

They change every time we play this game?  The choice is the 70s Earth Mama Muff  Which is nothing done to it  Pool rack filled with Afro hair  Yeah, yeah  The second choice is the Mohawk  All right  Or landing strip  Which is just a strip of hair  Running top to bottom  Okay  Then the Hitler mustache  Which is like the Mohawk 
[02:48:30]  But only trimmed down further  Closer to your crotch area  Looks like a little Hitler mustache  Sitting over the whole thing  And then, of course  The thing we like to call  The wood floor  Clean shaven  Or as I'm calling it today  The Cassie  Oh, that's awful  Oh, my God  Oh, my God  Yes, little Cassie Benet  Oh, you had to go there  Cassie Benet Ramsey  No  Well, just for the  Parent of the year award  Fellow that gave me the award

Once we guess, by the way  Don't tell us if we get it right  I'm the guessing  Yes  I think I need the  Circular motion is never telling  I think I need the  Side to side 
[02:50:30]  Side to side  Alright  Please  Yeah  Yeah  Alright  I guess it's time to guess  Choice of two  And I'm gonna have to  I'm gonna have to make the guess  Of  I didn't really hear  Any  Difference  In the sound  And it didn't quite sound  As much  Hair  As it did  Skin rubbing  On the phone  So I'm gonna say 
[02:51:00]  She's a little freaky  A little wild  There in Illinois  And that it's  Wood floor  Wood floor  That's what I'll say  Wood floor  Opie, your guess  Anthony  I  I agree with you  But  Oh, because it's early in the morning  I'm telling you  This has to be  A choice  Every time we play this game now  I'm going with the  Five o'clock shadow  You're gonna go with  Five o'clock shadow  It's a wood floor  But it might be  A couple days old  Okay  I'm gonna go with  An odd combination  I think it's a mohawk  With a  Or a landing strip 
[02:51:30]  With a five o'clock shadow  Around it  Ah, okay  Like she's shaved  A mohawk  But let it  Let it grow in  For a couple days  Fester a bit  If you will  Fester a bit  Alright, Karen  Uh-huh  What is in your pants?

[03:08:30]  Sure  Okay  Alright  What's going on  Do we know  What  Where are we  Huh  What the who the  I actually have to put this in here  You mean me  Old school  You're going old school  With the CD  You mean me  We should play that  You mean me  We're allowed to play that  That's old school  O&A stuff  Scooby Doo  Yeah but  Scooby Doo  Yeah maybe we'll play that  Into break  I don't even know where  Oh wow okay 
[03:09:00]  We had pretty much  The last interview  With the guy  That did the voice  Of Scooby Doo  Scooby Doo  And a lot of other  Cartoon voices  I actually love that bit  It's a little weird  But it's very uncomfortable  Actually to listen to  Why  Because he was  I had Alzheimer's  He had Alzheimer's  And we didn't know  And um  Well you know what  We'll talk a little while  And maybe we'll play it  Into break  I wouldn't mind that  Okay  I've never heard that  That was before my time  Yeah  You've never heard  The Scooby Doo guy  That was before the  N.E.W. days  I never heard it  It's like eight years old  You know  Anthony and I  Didn't have our 
[03:09:30]  Radio chops  Chops  But we had enough  Chops to get the bit  Done and I think  It would be  Good to listen to  Today Anthony  Right  Sure  What was going on  I need to stall  Here for a second  What was going on  At Walmart  Oh  Are they  Anytime Walmart's  In the news  It's always about  Something they're  Banning  And uh  They've banned  John Stewart  And Comedy Central's  Daily show  I have a book out 
[03:10:00]  And they've banned it  It will not be sold  At Walmart stores  What is it called  America the book  Yeah  And uh  They've banned it  Because there's  Pictures in there  You know  They do uh  Wacky funny comedy  About the news  And subject matter  Like that  And uh  They took  These nude pictures  Of these nude bodies  And put the heads  Of the Supreme Court  Justices on the body  I saw the page  In the book  It's very very funny  Like you would do  With Photoshop  Or something 
[03:10:30]  You know  They give some  Of the judges  Like uh  Infant penises  Yeah  And uh  What's her name  I guess we should  Know the names  Of those guys  Oh Ruth Bader Ginsburg  Or Sandra Day O'Connor  Thank you  Uh  There you go  They give them  Big 70's  Earth Mama moths  It's actually  A very funny picture  How about if they  Wrap it in hard plastic  Do they wrap the book  Will they sell it  Then if they wrap it  So no one can open it  Probably not  Because the content  They don't sell  That type of content  You know unfortunately  America's losing  This argument  But why is Kmart  You know  Deciding what  Walmart  Uh Kmart  Holy crap  Why is Walmart 
[03:11:00]  Man I'm having  A really bad day  Oh you're sleepy  I'm very sleepy  Why is Walmart  Deciding what  We should buy  I don't get that  They would say  Unless it's like  We're just deciding  What we would sell  They are  They have the right  To do it  Yeah  And people keep  Shopping there  So you dummies  Out there  I'm one of them  I like Walmart  They have everything  It's an amazing store  It really is  But I mean  You know  When these places  Get so big  It gets scary  Then they decide  You know  What we could shop for  I don't like that  It's not about them 
[03:11:30]  Let me tell you  Some Walmart's  About making money  And what happens  Is these scumbag  Christian groups  And family right groups  That's what it is  Complain  And they're like  Look you have 400 stores  We'll boycott them  If you sell  Inappropriate material  Could you see those  Holy rollers  Boycotting Walmart  Where would they go  That's like their life  I know  But they spend a lot  Of money in these places  So Walmart sells  Awful clothes  They wouldn't boycott them  Though  They would never boycott them  If they tried to  If they threatened to  And they cost them  Any business  They'd have withdrawals  They wouldn't be able 
[03:12:00]  To stay out of Walmart  Anthony and I  Talked about this  In a lot of the interviews  We've done  In the past two years  Name one boycott  That really really works  Selma buses  What?  Selma bus boycott  How many years ago  Was that?  He said name one  I'm talking about something  You know  Within the last 10 years  Yeah give us  10, 20 years  20 years  These boycotts  Don't really work  And these corporations  They just get so scared  When someone threatens  To boycott  What boycotts have  I don't know  Have there been any  I mean it does probably 
[03:12:30]  Cost them money  That you don't see  There is constant threats  Of boycotts  That go on now  People love it  They fire up letters  To the FCC  Or wherever  And then they write  To the company  And say if you don't  Stop doing this  We're going to boycott  Your product  And the company  Usually buckles under  Usually  Always buckles under  And there's never  A boycott  I would love to  For once  See them say no  Go screw yourself  And then see if a boycott  Ever materializes 
[03:13:00]  How long are people  Going to do it for?  They're not  People are so self-centered  That if it inconveniences  Them in any way  Whatsoever  They don't do it  They don't do it  They couldn't hold  Together a boycott  Just wouldn't work  They might boycott  For an hour or two  But then they got  You know bills to pay  And families to raise  These boycotts  They never last  Most products are not  Important enough  To not boycott  Like what I'm saying is  If you boycott Coke  People will do that  Just because there's Pepsi  Like almost every product 
[03:13:30]  Is replaceable  They won't  And I think that's why  Some organizations  They won't  See now  Organizes a boycott  And I think they're revolting  But say they get  35,000 people  In that  They have millions of people  Say they get 35,000 or 40,000  To boycott a product  That's a lot of money  The company's losing  But see here's the point  The Jon Stewart book  Is harmless  I agree  Do you honestly think  That people are going to  Boycott Walmart  Because the book  Is being sold there  Of course not  That's what scares me  It's not even a product  That's worth the time of day  To boycott  Just put it out there 
[03:14:00]  They're deciding  It's just a policy they have  Which is revolting  I agree with you  I think it stinks  I'm all for guns and stuff  But it's so hypocritical  That you can buy  Whatever you want  As far as your  Plenty of rounds of ammo  And yeah  Whatever guns you want  But the Jon Stewart book  Is the problem  I mean it's so stupid  It really is stupid  They're family oriented  They're making their own rules  They decide  Gun's good  Jon Stewart's comedy book  Skewing the political process  Is bad 
[03:14:30]  Why?  I know  Old people good  Unions bad  We've seen how Walmart operates  Free to walk out  Anytime you want  Bad  Lock employees in overnight  Good  You know  Come on  We know how they work  That's why they sell stuff cheap  I love it  This cannot be true  Johnny the trucker  What's up Johnny?  Hey what's going on fellas?  I'm sorry that we haven't talked  To the truckers  In the last couple of days  But we've been very busy  We know you're still out there  Spreading the ONA virus  So we appreciate that  Hey Brian  We need a break  From that good buddy shit 
[03:15:00]  I know I hear you  What's up Johnny?  Hey man  You're talking about  The religious right  And everything  With Walmart  I live in a small town  In Pennsylvania  Right outside of Scranton  They  Put an ordinance  Out of my town  That they don't want  Halloween and trick or treat  To fall on a Sunday  This year  So  I don't know what kind of  Fines are going to be  Assessed  For kids going out  Trick or treating  On Sunday  But they say it's because  It falls on a school night  Is it officially banned  From your town?  It's an ordinance  They cannot trick or treat 
[03:15:30]  On Sunday  They're holding it  On Saturday instead  That's the religious right  That's ridiculous  How about if you trick or treat  In a church  And you show up  In a little altar boy outfit  With knee pads  Will they accept that?  I'll try that  Yeah  How does the religious thing  Seep into our society  Where  On Sunday  The stores close  You can't get anything  Buy liquor  There's laws  That you can't do this  That  How does that  Come into play  You know  How awful 
[03:16:00]  Every year  I dress up  Like this year  I'm spray painting  My body black  And I'm putting on diapers  And I'm going  As Mark Parenteau's  Prom date  Oh this guy's hilarious  The PC killer  Wants in on this  Conversation  PC killer  Where are you bro?  Yeah I'm down here  In Virginia  I'm a truck driver  And I want to say  The company I drive for  But right now  I am hauling clothes  For Walmart  That comes from 
[03:16:30]  Overseas sweatshops  Now if this place  Is so  Huppity  About  You know  What's right in that  They shouldn't be  Buying these clothes  From sweatshops  Of course not  Well  Come on  Jackknife it  Just for the fun of it  Yeah well  They got their own rules  You know  Yeah  Sweatshops okay  Jon Stewart  Not okay  Yeah  Guns okay  Yeah  Alright  The other thing  I've been listening  To you guys  Since you first  Came into Philadelphia  And we're going up  Against that idiot  From the other

[03:43:30]  Like we first got married we used to sleep like spoons  Right there man  Now we sleep like brother and sister  Get on your side  She's got to have her wall of pillows built between us  Burley and god damn wall  I just crawl over and check if we're going to have sex every once in a while  Do you want to have sex  No  Okay  Just checking  Oh I joke 
[03:44:00]  But I think sex gets better the longer you're together  Because you're not afraid to tell each other what you really want  Put your head down  I can't see the TV  Sorry  That's why rednecks like to do it doggy  Style  They can both watch nascar  Give me a pork rind sweetie  What's that train noise coming toward our trailer  I like being married though 
[03:44:30]  I think men need to be married  I think women are actually the other half of our brain  That's why god meant us to be a couple  Men come up with goofy ideas  A woman will think about that idea  Tell you no and save your life  That's why married men live longer than single men  Because we've got somebody that will tell our ass no  When's the last time you heard about a married man dying in a bungee jumping accident
