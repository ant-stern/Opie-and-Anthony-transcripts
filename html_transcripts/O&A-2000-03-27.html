<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show begins with the hosts returning from vacation, complaining about faulty headphones and studio equipment changes.  Larry, a caller, cracks a joke about Anthony's unwanted magazine subscriptions.  Opie recounts his Turks and Caicos trip, detailing scuba diving (including unpleasant encounters in a resort pool) and topless beachgoers, while Anthony describes his Miami and Disney World adventures.  They discuss their NCAA bracket, with Opie relieved Anthony's team lost.  The show revisits their previous Turks and Caicos broadcast, contrasting their outdoor show with Tom Likas's isolated hotel room broadcast. Opie fondly remembers the free Sam Adams beer. The new 1-800 number, 877-692-1027, becomes a source of comedic mnemonic attempts.

Numerous station changes are announced: the lunch table's relocation, their office upgrade (into their old boss's larger office), the morning show's departure, and the demise of several office plants.  The hosts discuss the morning show's low ratings and the office politics surrounding their promotion, including an anecdote about a disgruntled Earl, now relegated to a cubicle, who calls into the show for an extended conversation.  Listener calls and staff interactions continue throughout this segment, including difficulty obtaining No Doubt tickets due to past on-air comments. The segment ends with jokes about Spaz's suit (a lost bet consequence) and the creation of "Spaz's Week in Review," a new segment with pre-recorded content from Spaz.

The next segment opens with the announcement of Spaz’s new recurring segment.  Darcy Duran wins their NCAA contest, earning a trip for correctly predicting three of four Final Four teams. A brief, nonsensical call with Jammer follows.  Anthony details his 90 mph Florida road trip, narrowly avoiding a speeding ticket due to a police stop ahead of him. His Disney World critique focuses on outdated attractions, and his Kennedy Space Center visit lacked any mention of the Challenger disaster.  The conversation shifts to a previous flight to Los Angeles, with Opie recounting Anthony's drunken antics, including an encounter with an elderly woman.  They discuss their flight anxieties, with Anthony's preference for experienced male pilots.

The "Most Offensive Song Contest" is revisited, with entries plagued by poor audio quality.  "Camp Concentration" is showcased as an exception.  Steve from the Opie and Anthony website updates the online voting, with "KKK Man" and "Baby Raper" leading.  The possibility of live performances, possibly with anonymity for safety, is discussed.  The "Girl of Opie and Anthony" contest and plans for an upcoming road show featuring an "ugly ass competition" are briefly mentioned.  The extremely racist and offensive winning song, "KKK Man," is played, and the hosts plan to submit it to the Guinness Book of World Records.

The following segment begins with a snippet of the offensive KKK song, followed by listener calls describing the songs as “offensive” and “disgusting.”  The focus shifts to the "King Gimp" Oscar moment, with detailed and humorous descriptions of the man’s fall, eliciting laughter and speculation about the filmmakers’ missed opportunities and Billy Crystal’s lack of response.  Listener-submitted speculation about an alleged incestuous relationship between Angelina Jolie and her brother follows, including theories about the brother's sexuality.  Tangents include Robin Williams’ "Blame Canada," Phil Collins' hairstyle, and Jane Fonda's Oscar presence. The segment concludes with giveaways: Mets opening day tickets and a Fat Boy Slim mix CD.

The final segment starts with Fat Boy Slim CD giveaways and a discussion about Kiss's "farewell" tour and the potential for multiple farewell tours, much like The Who.  The hosts criticize the lack of promotional support from record companies, specifically targeting Godsmack and Sully Erna for insufficient engagement.  The OzFest lineup, featuring Ozzy Osbourne, and a humorous anecdote about Ozzy snorting ants are discussed. The slow syndication process and difficulties in gaining network trust due to past controversies are detailed.  A desire for WNEW to be rebranded as "The Opie and Anthony Station" is expressed.

A substantial portion focuses on "Spaz Radio," featuring Spaz's comedic news report, filled with rambling, often nonsensical commentary on various news stories (nude beaches in Italy, a man retrieving a phone from a lion's cage, a death row inmate's parakeet request).  Opie and Anthony’s interruptions and off-color jokes punctuate Spaz's report.  Listener calls react to Spaz’s report and the hosts' discussions.  Spaz's report is promised to continue the next day.  A brief mention of Kathy Lee Gifford mentioning the show (possibly a joke) and a threat from someone claiming to be from "The Sopranos" conclude the broadcast.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  What'd you learn on a job?  I'd like to be a functioning idiot without a high school diploma to get a job in a radio.  O.B. and Anthony.  Theater of the Mindless.  1027.  W.N.E.W.  Alright, we're back.  Hey!  Hey!  Back, really back.  Wait a minute, first of all, my headphones are screwed up.  Yeah, yeah, when you're gone for like a week,  things get all effed up around here.  I can't hear anything, right? 
[00:00:30]  Does that sound weird?  And your headphones in?  Uh, that's a little better.  Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  Ouch, I don't like this at all.  What did they do wrong?  What did they do differently?  Anyone know?  Alright, that's not it.  That ain't it.  Uh, uh, let's put it back in there.  Alright, well, it's the O.B. and Anthony show.  We're back from vacation.  Yes.  Are you well-rested, my friend? 
[00:01:00]  I am very well-rested, Anthony.  My man, I'm trying to hook stuff up.  I see that.  I'm just, like, freaking out because the headphones sound absolutely horrendous.  They must have put new equipment in here or something  since we were last broadcasting live from the NAW studio.  To make it sound better.  To make it sound better?  Yeah, don't they always do that?  To make the other radio shows around here sound better?  We did it for you to make it sound better.  Well, gee, thanks.  Now we're going to be thrown off all day.  No one out there can relate to what we're saying, 
[00:01:30]  so we should just shut our mouths.  Because to them, you know, it sounds exactly the same.  Yeah.  But they did something with the equipment,  so it sounds really, really different in our headphones.  Like, really, really, really, really different.  It's different.  This is not the sound that I'm used to.  I'm used to a completely different sound,  and now we've got this sound in our headphones.  All right.  They're tweaking all the buttons, man.  You're just making it worse.  It just sounded like a robot voice in my headphones, dude. 
[00:02:00]  By your command.  All right.  We're going to have to deal with it.  What the hell?  Man.  Well, what's up, Anthony?  Oh, not too much, Opie.  It was great not seeing you for a week.  Oh, thank you.  Hey, thanks.  Didn't think of you once.  Thank you.  Well, I was down there in Turks and Caicos.  What's wrong?  There's more I've seen.  Ed's going through all his mail.  Well, we got a lot of junk mail since we last talked to you guys.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:02:30]  Come on.  You've got to bring it up on the air.  I'm a real comedian.  Are you going to bring it up or not?  Someone's really smart.  Someone's screwing with you bad.  Yeah.  I'm like, no, subscribing me to magazines.  Well, you've got somebody's done that.  You've got some groovy magazines over there, Anthony.  Yeah, groovy magazines. 
[00:03:00]  That's good.  You can just cancel them.  I don't care.  It's, like, ridiculous.  All right.  Oh, good.  People.  There you go.  Oh, look at that.  I might be a millionaire.  Hey, Larry, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  I just wanted to welcome you back.  Thank you.  It was only a week.  Well, you know what?  When you listen as much as I do, everything's a goddamn repeat when you're gone.  Oh, really?  Everything.  Yeah.  We try to keep the worst of it as fresh as possible, but I don't know. 
[00:03:30]  I was reading some email.  It seemed like you guys were digging last week's show.  How was the Turks Caicos?  Oh, Club Med.  It's the way to go, man.  That's where I went, man.  You been there?  Did you do the trapeze?  I did the trapeze.  Scared the crap out of you.  Scared the crap out of me.  They have a trapeze set up down there.  You can do a little swinging.  You've got to be a midget to walk up that ladder.  Oh, man.  Just walking up the ladder was good enough for me.  Let me tell you something.  It would be nice if they brought the board over to the ladder.  Yeah.  Instead, you've got to jump over. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah, and you've got to reach for the swing thing.  Forget it.  Ah, yeah.  Forget it.  And, listen, I hear Anthony got all those magazines.  Yeah.  Great thing, if you're pissed off at somebody, take all those little cards and fill them  out in somebody else's name and bill me later.  No, I guess that's...  You can send them six zillion magazines.  I guess that's what happened.  Hey, I'm telling you, best way to screw with someone.  Yeah, I've done that before.  It's funny.  But that's what you've got to do.  It's funny when it happens to someone else, though.  Ah, yeah. 
[00:04:30]  Well, we'll just put something in at the station that says, any magazines that come to me,  they get sent by.  It doesn't matter.  We'll get the lawyers on top of that one.  Well, Larry, thank you.  Thanks for calling back.  We missed you, you effers.  Larry?  Mm-hmm.  Larry's gone.  I didn't even get my last name right.  I'm going to still send it.  Hey, Jim, you're next on NEW.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Good to have you back.  Hey, thanks.  Listen, it's lovely listening to your worst of.  Yeah.  The only problem we have is that we have to listen to Rick. 
[00:05:00]  He's like a non-volume, non-emotional type talking person there.  It's like the talking of the living dead.  Oh, this is Rick.  What are you talking about?  Oh, we'll be back with some more Best of Opie and Anthony in a few minutes.  Oh, I want to shoot myself.  I don't know why he puts on a radio voice when he does that.  Yeah, because when he's on our show, he talks normal.  Yeah, that's a perfect voice for him, and he should be just normal like every day. 
[00:05:30]  What's up, man?  Unbelievable.  I heard he said that a lot.  We can't bust out, man.  Yeah, we can't bust out.  The guy's gone.  He's on vacation this week himself, so.  But I heard he turned it into the Rick show.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, he was trying to overpower that, which everybody knows.  If you weren't listening closely, you just assumed that we got fired and it was now the Rick show.  They hired Rick for the Rick show. 
[00:06:00]  The Rick show.  Welcome to Mr. Boron's afternoon show.  All right.  Guys, good to have you back.  Thank you, Jim.  Bye-bye.  All right, bye.  What's he really doing?  All right, you guys, we're just getting started, obviously.  They've messed with the equipment in here, and we've got to take a quick break and see if they can fix that real fast.  All right.  Because it sounds really, really bizarre in our headphones.  All right, so a quick break.  We'll be back.  Phone's already ringing like crazy.  We like to see that.  212-757-1027 is the phone line to get a hold of us, okay? 
[00:06:30]  What's this 877-692-1027 number?  Our new 1-800 number.  Our new 1-800?  Our new 1-800 number to get a hold of the radio show, Andy.  Oh, get out of here.  They couldn't come up with a better combination of numbers?  Hey, if you want to call the 1-800 number, it's 877-692-1027.  Who the hell in their right mind is going to remember that?  It's not even like 800.  It's 877.  I know.  I know.  It's 877-692-10...  No, it has a pen in their car to write that down. 
[00:07:00]  It's our 800 number that doesn't have 800 in it.  Right.  It's 877.  Well, it starts with an 8.  Good.  Glad to see everyone was busy while we were away.  What did they accomplish?  They got a 1-800 number that doesn't make any sense since we were last year.  It's 877, Opie.  It's an 877 number.  877-692-1027.  Give us a call on the toll-free line.  877-692-1027.  It's our toll-free 800 number. 
[00:07:30]  That's an 877 number.  877.  Why couldn't they just get, you know, 1-800-555-1027?  Something that people could quickly remember.  I don't think people give out 800 numbers anymore.  I think they're all giving out.  All right.  So now they give out 877.  Wait, let me look at the phone.  Maybe 692 means something in letters.  Does it?  Oh, wait.  Here we go.  6 is a M-N-O.  And then a 9 is the W-X-Z.  Oh, geez.  And a 2 is the A-B-C. 
[00:08:00]  That's nothing.  Does that make any sense to anyone out there?  That spells nothing.  It spells May.  What?  877-May-1027.  No, does it?  Yeah, I'm trying to come up with an easier way to remember this number.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  In order?  There's no way that spells May.  Yeah, 6.  You could use the M.  The 9.  Dude.  Oh, no, you're right.  Yeah, you can't mix it around.  All right, all right.  Let's not mix it up.  All right, let me try this again.  Did you smoke any ganja when you were down there? 
[00:08:30]  Oh, man, yo.  Those guys know how to make a living at Club Med.  No, I did not smoke any reefer, though, Anthony.  The second I got to Miami, I'm walking down the sidewalk, and the guy comes up to me.  Coke.  Cocaine.  You felt like you were back in Times Square circa 1978.  Yeah, it doesn't even happen in New York anymore.  All of a sudden, some guy's asking me if I want some Coke.  Oh, wait.  So, you know, I bought a couple of keys.  All right, let's go to Mike.  Mike? 
[00:09:00]  Hey, what's up?  You got through on the new 1-800 number that starts 877?  Yeah, I just want to express myself here to a couple of brainless idiots that feel that  we need a pencil to remember it.  Yeah, wow.  Very good.  You've got a good brain.  I guess you didn't smoke a lot of pot when you were younger.  No, no, I didn't do any of that.  All right, Mike, thank you.  All right, welcome back.  Hey, thank you.  All right, so 692, we still can't figure out what an easy way. 
[00:09:30]  How about we start with the O?  O, A, Z.  A?  Where do you get an A?  Oh, I keep going the wrong way.  O.  X, OXA.  What?  Is it an O, the first one?  Yeah.  Or it could be an M, an N, or an O, the 6.  M, N, or O.  All right.  And then you have to make, the next number is W, X, Y, or Z. 
[00:10:00]  And then what's the other one?  A, B, C.  So it could be N, W, A?  Niggers with Attitudes?  Yeah, you could do N, W, A.  All right.  What, that works too?  N, Y, C?  That's pretty good.  N, Y, C, okay.  All right, New York City.  All right, we're getting some.  That's better than N, W, A?  I don't know.  All right, so we could, so if you want to call them the 1-800 number, it's 877-  N, Y, C, N, Y, C, 1-0-2-7.  All right, now we're talking.  We're on to something.  Here, give us a call.  Give us a call on our toll-free line. 
[00:10:30]  877-NYC-1-0-2-7.  All right, we're getting somewhere.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  We're just getting warmed up.  We've got to talk about vacation.  You guys got to fill us in on what happened around here the last week.  Yeah, we want to know.  I didn't read a paper or watch TV for a week.  Didn't have a phone in my room, so I am freaking clueless.  Yeah.  Did any countries bomb another country or anything like that?  I don't think so, as far as I know.  All right.  I know, let's see.  The Academy Awards were last night. 
[00:11:00]  We'll talk about that.  We'll talk about that.  We'll talk about that.  The highlight of the moment of the whole show.  The camp.  The camp, man.  All right, dude, we've got way too much to do today.  Let's just take a quick break, and we'll be back.  Stay there.  This is Vince McMahon of the WWF, and if you love a good cage match, you're going to love  Opie and Anthony on 1027 WNEW.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's usually just a bunch of guys sweating and burping and farting.  Hail to the kings of the radio.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:11:30]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Back from vacay.  Hey, man.  Trying to get back into the swing of things here.  Yeah.  Trying to figure out what the hell happened since we last left you.  So we went on vacation, Anthony.  Yes, we did.  I did the Club Med Turquoise down there in Turks and Caicos. 
[00:12:00]  Turks and Caicos.  It was there a couple years ago.  Yeah.  And I went back.  Had a great, great time.  And I don't even know if he's advertising this week, but I've got to thank Dr. Philip Toph and  Diamond Vision for my brand new eyes.  Oh, now you can see what I did last time.  Let me tell you something.  Turks and Caicos.  Topless broads all over the place, Anthony.  All over the beach.  All over the place.  It's great.  And before I got my new eyes, I had to try to figure out some excuse why I needed to walk 
[00:12:30]  like two feet past their beach chair.  That past week, I'm like near the shoreline, a good, I don't know, 20, 30 yards away, seeing  boobs crystal clear, Anthony.  Yes.  Like, you guys could see this stuff?  Yeah, we were seeing that last time.  Oh, my God.  Everything was fuzzy for you.  Yeah.  I'm not kidding.  I always had to make believe I would walk past a topless lady, make him believe I just  happened to be sitting next to her, and then I would make my beeline out of the area 
[00:13:00]  to check out the boobs.  But this past week, the stuff I was seeing, my Lord.  Real boobage.  With your new peepers.  Yeah.  I think I figured out what's wrong with the headphones, by the way.  Why?  I learned to scuba dive over vacay.  Oh, maybe it's your ears.  Yeah, I think my ears are really.  Really?  Yeah.  Come on.  I'm serious.  Jacques Cousteau, you were doing it with the tanks and everything.  Yes, I was. 
[00:13:30]  Wow.  Something I always wanted to do, and I finally did it.  I thought you were too big a fag to do that.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Do that.  That's pretty heavy duty.  Down there with the monsters of the deep.  Have you ever dived, Anthony?  No.  I've done some snorkeling over it.  You've done something?  Nothing in the realm of...  Some snorkeling.  Of putting on...  Strapping on the tanks.  Oh, it was awesome.  Like you did.  It was a great, great time, man.  So what did you see?  The drain?  The skimmer?  What did you see?  Well, you do start in the pool.  I did the resort course. 
[00:14:00]  Right.  Let me tell you something.  I highly recommend that you never, ever, ever swim in a public pool.  Because when you're underwater with scuba gear in the pool, and you see the crap that  is floating...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Because you've got the mask on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can see crystal clear down there.  And a lot of girls have no...  It was funny because...  What the hell?  You need this?  It was funny because we're at the bottom of the pool.  Yeah.  Huge pool down there at Club Med.  And when the scuba people, like myself, learning, we take over a corner. 
[00:14:30]  There's like, I don't know, eight of us underwater.  Yeah.  And all the girls are jumping in the pool and stuff.  Oh, so you've got a perfect view.  Oh, yeah.  Their bathing suits are falling down and stuff.  And they have no idea what's down there.  They're just checking out everything.  And then there's all sorts of, like, tissue just floating around the pool.  What do you mean tissue?  Like tissue paper or human tissue?  No, just like tissue paper and magazine articles and substances just floating.  God knows what that was.  It's pretty disgusting.  It was disgusting.  But, uh, so after, like, uh, you know, learning how to scoo and dive... 
[00:15:00]  And how long does that take?  Uh, three and a half hours for two days.  Two days?  Yeah, two quick days.  The first day, like, two hours.  Second day, an hour and a half.  Now, the first day, you're supposed to go in the pool, right?  Right.  Next day, you're supposed to go in the ocean, but not too far out.  Offshore, maybe, I don't know, in 20 feet of water, if you're lucky, okay?  The water was too rough, so we had to spend the second lesson in the pool.  In the pool again?  Yeah.  Aw, come on.  Then the third day, when it was time to dive, it was time to take the big step forward. 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  Our boat ride in the middle of the ocean in 60 feet of water.  Whoa.  That's a drastic difference than being in eight foot of water.  In the pool, where you have walls and chicks jumping in.  Now there's, like, the monsters of the deep.  Oh, I was having, like, a panic attack under there.  Aw.  Like, the first dive, it was just all about making sure I was going to survive.  Yeah, yeah.  Then the second dive, I was able to look around and check out what it was all about.  Yeah, it's still pretty creepy.  But down there in Turks and Caicos, they'd take you diving next to what's called the wall. 
[00:16:00]  Anthony?  Yeah.  Now, like the beginners, like myself, we were in, like, 60 feet of water, which isn't that  big of a deal, okay?  But that's the bottom.  That's the bottom.  We were standing on the sand looking up, 60 feet, whatever, blah, blah, blah.  But where the wall is, is, like, a ridge.  And on the other side of this ridge, it drops down, ready for this?  6,000 feet.  Did you do it?  Did you go to the bottom?  Watch your eyeballs, like, implode? 
[00:16:30]  Come on.  6,000 feet.  So, the certified divers, they were, you know, they went down 140, 150 feet, no problem.  You can still barely even go down any deeper.  No, you can't go much deeper than that.  I think you can go over 200, but you have to, I mean, I could get into this, but whatever.  But they allowed us to at least float over the ridge and check it out.  And you're looking down into this abyss that was, like, 6,000,000 feet straight down.  Thank you, no.  No?  Thank you, no.  It was freaking cool. 
[00:17:00]  Not today, thanks.  Thank you.  But anyway, so I didn't have a TV, didn't read news.  They did have, like, a TV near the bar so I could check out some stock quotes and stuff.  Yeah, well, you've got to keep up on that.  And I've got to tell you what I did later.  Yeah, we'll get into your vacation next.  But the funny thing is, we'll talk about the NCAA.  Yeah.  And I both just did horrible.  I did a little better than you.  Well, that's what I want to get into.  Neither one of us had a team make it into the Final Four.  No.  And I was really surprised. 
[00:17:30]  All my picks were just out early, basically.  And the last night of vacation, I'm going in to eat some food.  I had to get up off the table because I was panicking because Purdue.  Purdue.  Purdue almost made it to the Final Four as a close game.  So I had to run back out to the bar just freaking, like, there's no way in hell one of Anthony's teams is going to make it to the Final Four.  I was pulling for Purdue.  Yes.  Thank God Wisconsin pulled it out.  Yeah.  I was freaking.  I was pissed.  And I'm with Sandy.  And Sandy's like, what's the big deal? 
[00:18:00]  I'm like, you don't understand.  First of all, Ant comes across on a radio show like he has no clue about sports.  And if one of his teams makes it into the Final Four and none of mine make it, and I have to pay him $200 on top of the $600 I owe him, I'm not going to be a happy camper.  No.  I thought I was going to walk away with a little victory there.  Yeah.  Purdue.  Care of Purdue.  So then they lost, and I could go to dinner and be like, oh, thank God I don't have to pay him any money, man.  Ho, ho. 
[00:18:30]  Great.  So you're watching some TV at the bar in between.  You know, you don't usually, I don't know, you're there at Turks and Caicos and I'm watching TV.  No, I wasn't.  Not really.  No.  Just the Purdue game a little bit and just stock quotes at the end of the day, which was in between, like, you know, scuba diving and dinner.  I would check out what my stocks did in.  Do some drinking?  A little bit.  Yeah?  Got to really tie it on?  No.  Like last time we were there?  With the free beer?  Well, the reason I went back to Turks and Caicos, I guess we should explain. 
[00:19:00]  Ant and I, two years ago, went down there with Sam Adams.  We had a broadcast.  We broadcasted live from Turks and Caicos with, like, all these other radio stations all over the concert.  That's where we met.  Well, we officially didn't meet the dick that is Tom Likas, but.  Yeah, he was on that same little junket we were with about ten other stations.  Right.  And he wouldn't come out and broadcast with everybody else.  He wouldn't come out of his room.  He had the engineers who, I mean, this island is so remote, they didn't have a facility to broadcast from.  They had to fly in all kinds of satellite equipment and everything else to enable us to broadcast back to the states. 
[00:19:30]  Likas gets the engineers to move where he's supposed to broadcast from into his room.  Into his room.  So he didn't have to deal with anybody, I guess.  It's beautiful.  We're outdoors.  We're broadcasting from reclining chairs, drinking beer.  It's 90.  The sun's out.  Palm trees everywhere.  The ocean that looks like a turquoise color. 
[00:20:00]  Free beer.  And we're just laying out.  It's outside.  We're not even in a studio.  We're outside with mics in our hands broadcasting live.  It was paradise.  Warm, tropical breeze.  And the ass is in his room broadcasting.  Come on!  Because I guess.  The wind will blow my mongoloid hairdo.  I guess he was too big for everyone or something.  Yeah, that was something.  So that was our first little tidbit of.  Oh, but all right.  Getting back to what you were saying, though.  Yes, Sam Adams brought us down there.  So check out this deal.  Because where Club Med gets you is the drinking. 
[00:20:30]  Because everything else is taking care of the food and most of the activities.  But after dinner, you definitely want to have a few pops.  A few wobbly pops.  And they charge you for the drink.  And they charge you.  And you could go through a pretty hefty bar tab by the time the week's over.  Yes, you can.  When Ant and I were down there with Sam Adams broadcasting live, they were trying out a  new beer and stuff.  They gave us all badges, like VIP badges.  Badges.  To hang around our neck.  And all we had to do was flash that wherever we were.  And we got free Sam Adams for a week straight. 
[00:21:00]  Ruled.  Some of the people that we were with basically had like 30 or 40 beers a day.  Yeah.  Not kidding.  Not kidding.  We had to bring a few.  Had to.  We had fun with them.  We brought some listeners and a bunch of other people we worked with at the time.  Yeah.  And they were just starting their day with Sam Adams instead of like milk for their corn  flakes.  It was unbelievable, the drinking.  So you didn't drink that much.  No.  Any Cubans?  You puff on any Cubans?  A couple Cubans, Anthony.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Rumor has it you're allowed to bring some of that back into the States. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  That's what I was hearing.  Really?  But I wasn't sure if someone was setting me up.  I don't know.  I think there's still an embargo.  A few people were saying, well, they lifted the embargo a little bit and you're allowed  to bring.  They said, you're allowed to bring a box of Cubans back into the States.  Oh, sure you are.  I'm like, I didn't trust people that much.  No.  I don't think that's true.  Thank you.  Yeah.  So I didn't try to sneak any Cubans back into the States.  But it was a good time overall.  Definitely.  Good.  It was great to be away. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  Even though I wasn't really away because a lot of New Yorkers go to Turks and Caicos.  I heard like half the people there, more than half from New York.  Yeah.  And I was known as, I think that's him.  Oh, yeah.  Is that the guy?  I think that's him.  That's the guy.  That's, I think that's Opie from Opie and Anthony.  So.  Wow.  But there you have it.  I had to go to a place that didn't speak English.  You went to Miami, Yami.  I spent some time in my jammy.  All right.  Want to talk about that next?  Oh, sure.  Quick break and we'll talk about Anthony's vacay to Miami and Disney World. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, yeah.  Online trading.  It was great.  I drove, you know.  We'll get into the whole thing next.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0 that you guys won't speak to.  I need to fuck one of them.  Stop.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony, can I borrow your NSYNC CD?  No.  Put it back. 
[00:23:00]  Put it back with my Shania Twain.  My, what else do I got here?  My Jazzy Jeff and Fresh Prince Greatest Hits.  And pure reggae, Mom.  And pure reggae.  I'm going to choke somebody.  You sure I can't have your NSYNC CD?  Oh, no.  That's mine.  All right.  Let's rock. 
[00:23:30]  Stone Cold Crazy, yo.  All right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back from vacation.  I don't know if we're going to accomplish anything today, but God damn, we're having fun.  Nice to be back.  I missed you, Ephraim.  I realize how boring my life is when I'm not here.  It's great to be back with our brand new 800 number, Opie.  Yeah.  877-692-1027.  A little easier if it's 877-NYC. 
[00:24:00]  1027.  1027.  1027.  NYC, like New York City.  Thank you.  I see the place was hard at work since we've even gone.  Yeah.  They came up with a 1-800 number that makes no sense.  800 number that doesn't even have 800 in it.  I know.  Yeah, because then we got memos and stuff.  Hey, push the new 800 number.  New 800 number.  But it's 877.  That's not an 800 number.  It's not an 800.  I guess officially it's an 800 number, but we all know the 800 number to be 800. 
[00:24:30]  What else do they do?  Do they encompass anything?  Do we hire a morning show?  Our office moved.  Yeah, I saw that.  Morning show.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my dear sweet Jesus.  Just when you thought it couldn't get any lower.  It's like watching somebody at the limbo.  You know, doing limbo, limbo.  And like last time they went under the bar, you're like, there's no way they could get any lower than that.  And then they come back around. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, my God.  They're like a piece of paper.  Slipping under the bar.  Yeah, I guess we got a little ratings trend or something while we were gone.  Yeah.  And, oh, it doesn't look good for the morning show.  I don't know.  I mean, I've never seen anything like this in my life.  There's not even a blip on the radar screen at this point.  Nothing.  Nothing.  And they know when they're leaving, I guess, or something.  I think they're leaving Friday.  But no one.  Aren't they?  Have you ever heard of a radio show that they tell you when you're leaving? 
[00:25:30]  Right.  Never.  Any time in radio, you probably know just listening to radio.  One day you'll be listening to your favorite DJ, and the next day he's just not there anymore.  He's gone.  He's gone.  That's how it happens.  You just get let go.  There's no notice.  There's no notice in radio.  You just get fired, because they don't want you doing the F show on your last week.  Like for the people that listen to Will Pandarus?  Yeah.  You'll see.  He'll just be gone.  It'll be amazing. 
[00:26:00]  All of a sudden, you'll be like, hey, where's Will?  And then the next day, there'll be the Slappy and Wappy show on there.  But there's no notice.  TJs don't go, hey, I'm going to be here another week, and then I'm gone.  So I'm going to lock the door and say F, F over and over again.  That's what they try to defend against.  A couple of times, though.  This station is the only one I've seen that works like this.  This is amazing.  Yeah.  And the morning show, I guess, has a week left?  A week left. 
[00:26:30]  They're gone Friday.  I walk the Green Mile to the elevator.  Hopefully, the sponge will be dry.  A little Green Mile reference.  Thank you.  I know.  No, I'm going to be listening to them Friday.  It'll be the first time I listen to them in eight months.  Yeah.  Just to see if they do the F show.  If they had the balls to do the F show.  The farewell show.  Because management is allowing them to do one last show Friday.  Yeah.  And I guess we have another show coming in. 
[00:27:00]  I would hope there's something there.  Well, you know, you never know.  Maybe just dead air.  Or maybe just music.  Well, at this point, the dead air wouldn't do much worse than what those guys got.  Just us talking about how bad it is.  You would think it would go up a little bit.  Just for everyone to check out why something is getting such low ratings, you would think would bring the ratings up.  Yeah.  I think it's down to .3.  .3 is the rumor. 
[00:27:30]  Like the ratings only go, you know, top 30.  Yeah.  Can you even name 30 stations if you had to?  No.  If your life depended on it, could you sit there.  Kill me.  No.  And name 30 stations that you could hear from your car?  No.  Mm-mm.  Well, we're not in the top 30 in our morning show.  Like Howard's in the 8s.  Yeah.  Around there.  Give or take a few, okay?  7s.  7s now?  No.  All right.  Let's take an argument.  He's an 8-0.  Okay.  8.0.  Right.  Our morning show is down to a .3. 
[00:28:00]  Don't get mistaken.  Don't get confused that it's a 3.  No, it's .3.  .3.  Right.  Like it's not even a whole number.  Three more of those, and then you add in a .1, and you'll have a whole number.  Right.  Oh, my God.  So we're trying to figure out what was accomplished since we were on vacation.  We got the new 1-800 number.  Yes.  I think we have a new morning show coming in, but I'm not really sure about that.  I'm not sure.  I'm reading a lot of speculation on the radio message.  Supposedly, we're going to Mornings Monday. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  That's what I'm reading.  All right.  Oh, and this just in.  And people are informing us on what was going on since we've been on vacation.  All right.  They moved the lunch table.  Ha!  Wait a minute.  That's a biggie.  They moved the lunch table below the lobby, Anthony.  Below the lobby.  So that would be outside the second set of doors.  Yeah.  Okay.  You now have to eat lunch around here in a hallway.  Yeah.  Isn't that a hallway? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  It's more like a little vestibule area.  Well, we have a lot of people working in an office atmosphere.  Yeah.  Just imagine your lobby.  Everyone has one at work for the most part.  A lobby.  Just imagine a lunch table in the middle of the lobby.  Take your lunch table out of your lunchroom and put it in your lobby.  Now, what went in the lunchroom?  Cubicles.  Oh, we had to kick people out so we could take the big office.  We took the big office.  You know what the scene is like here?  Did you ever watch Scarface, the movie Scarface?  Yeah. 
[00:29:30]  You ever see when Tony moves into that house that used to belong to the guy that he had killed?  Yes.  That's how we felt moving into the office.  That was our old boss's office.  I got to say, two years ago when Ant and I interviewed for this little radio show,  the guy who's no longer here, who doesn't like to be mentioned because then he likes to try to sue and stuff,  but we were interviewing with him, and I had a pause at the time.  Oh, he looks around the office.  I look around his office because he had the biggest office in this place, and I go, 
[00:30:00]  you know, someday this is going to be our office.  Oh, Jesus.  And almost two years later, it's ours.  We're moved in.  We're moved in.  That's it.  Everything's hooked up.  Working hunky-dory.  Thank you.  Like the big, huge Scott Muni office wasn't good enough for us.  No.  We had to take over the boss's office.  Well, they had to get us out of the other office that we were sharing with the morning show.  Well, that's how we started.  That's how we started.  Yeah, two years ago, we had a sharing office.  Boy, that would be ugly passing by in the hallway. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, how you doing?  Hey, morning show.  How's it going?  Don't fret about that .3.  .4 is right around the corner.  I'm sure things will change soon.  I guess we can't completely kick them in the face.  I mean, they were on the train track that the old bosses kind of set up for them.  No.  I think they needed the balls to just say F you and do what they wanted to do, which I don't think they ever did.  No. 
[00:31:00]  You know, at some point, we realized the boss didn't have a clue, and we weren't going to listen to him anymore.  That was the key.  We went over that.  That was the key, though.  The day we realized our old boss had no clue.  Yeah.  And then the show changed when we decided to say, you know what?  Screw everyone.  Thank God.  All right.  So, yeah, they moved the lunch table.  That's big news.  So they moved the lunch table.  We got a new office, the biggest one on the floor.  Good.  That works.  I'm already making plans for expansion, Anthony.  Are you?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:31:30]  I was looking at it.  It's like a big game of Scatego.  You've got to see how big our office is.  It's ridiculous.  We have, like, the whole show in there now.  We have Ben in there, Spaz, Rick.  Yep.  Psycho, Mark.  And we still have just a ton of room.  Lots of room.  And I was already telling management that we want a spiral staircase in the corner so it could go to the second floor of our office.  We're expanding upwards in the next year.  Expanding up?  Yeah.  Okay.  What the hell, right? 
[00:32:00]  Oh, my God.  What?  Did Earl cry?  Did Earl?  Now, I'm hearing a rumor.  Wait a minute.  Wait.  Let's get someone on the mic that knows the answer to this.  I'm hearing a rumor that Earl was almost in tears when he had to pack up his stuff and move it out of what is now our office,  what was formerly his office, for a long time, I guess, he was there.  Why would he cry?  I don't know.  I just think he was upset.  Yeah.  We had to dust off his work area. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  I've never seen so many damn cobwebs around a workstation in my life.  Jesus.  Oh, no.  Hey, where's everyone going?  Oh, no.  What happened?  I thought we were having fun.  What happened?  Oh, my God.  Oh.  So he was a little upset having to move his stuff out?  Yeah.  I guess.  That's kind of traumatic.  You never want to really move.  You get kind of acclimated to one area like that. 
[00:33:00]  What's wrong with that?  He's upset because now Earl's going to be upset, so now Earl's going to get a call.  So now Earl, instead of being in the nice, biggest office on the floor, is in the little pile of cubicles that used to be the lunchroom.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  We forgot to tell the people that the lunchroom now has all the cubicles.  Of all the people that were displaced from our new office.  People without offices, they are known as.  The people without an office, they are the nomads of N.E.W.  Roaming the hallways.  What happened was this one of the sales guys, he didn't mean to say it. 
[00:33:30]  He just said to Earl, he saw that Earl, he's like, Earl, where are you now?  And he just got, it looked like he was a little sad about the whole thing.  The man put me in the lunchroom.  Oh, and they also got like a new glass table outside the studio here.  Oh, in front of the lesbian couch?  In front of the lesbian couch, yeah.  A glass table?  Yeah.  We could use that, man.  Yeah.  Who's going to break in the glass table first?  I want a chick to take a dump on it. 
[00:34:00]  We'll slide someone underneath there.  Spaz.  And then the other thing, you notice all the dead plants around the place, Anthony.  Dead plants.  There's a couple dead plants in the office.  Yeah.  What's that about?  The new boss has a dead plant in his office.  What is that all about?  Trying to freshen up the place.  With dead plants?  They're dead.  All right.  We should just get the plastic ones.  Yeah, plastic ones.  Dead plants around the office.  No one's here to water them.  Are there any girls that work here anymore? 
[00:34:30]  No, I don't think so.  That's pretty much it.  It's a sausage factory.  No other than plants are dead.  Guys thought I had to take care of plants.  How many women are on this floor now?  Just Leslie, I think.  Just Leslie, right?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Is that it?  Yeah, that is it.  All the ladies are upstairs.  Wow.  Cleared this place out.  We really did, man.  Did anyone even say goodbye to Andrea?  No.  We want to wish Andrea...  That's kind of nasty, huh?  Everybody just like...  Did she just laugh?  Well, she didn't want anyone to really know. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, our music director left.  Yeah.  Friday.  We want to wish her the best.  We were on vacation, and we were like, you know...  Yeah, she was here from the start.  We liked her.  What the hell's wrong with Earl?  Earl's on the line.  Hey, Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Earl.  Turn the radio down, Earl.  Erco.  Hello, Earl.  Erco.  Earth to Earl.  Hey...  Are you kidding me?  Hey, Earl.  Come on, Earl.  If you're going to call our show, say something, you ass. 
[00:35:30]  Dude, what is wrong with him?  What is wrong with him?  He's going to go postal, I'm telling you.  Yeah.  I don't doubt it.  The person most likely to go postal around here was Spaz, but I think Earl is now in the  league.  Yeah.  Why would he call and not say anything, you ass?  And then he gets pissed when we say, you know, that there was cobwebs around his workstation.  I sat down.  I sat down at his workstation.  You know, it was like the Brian Regan bin.  I was like, oh, oh, what's all this? 
[00:36:00]  There's cobwebs attached from the chair to the computer.  Oh, my God.  All memos, get Scotso coffee.  Yeah, we'll talk about Spaz in a suit, doesn't it?  Yeah.  For some reason, Spaz is in a suit.  All right.  Pick up flash fires.  Look at him screaming.  Earl.  Yo.  What?  If you're going to call the show, talk.  No, I had a question for Ben that had absolutely nothing to do with the show. 
[00:36:30]  So I didn't want to waste time.  All right.  Waste time by talking about it.  Well, welcome back to NEW, by the way.  We haven't talked to you.  We were on vacation.  Good to have you back, guys.  No, we've always been here.  I'm saying welcome back to you because you left and it looked like you weren't coming back  because you got pissed off at us, remember?  Well, there was a minor problem.  Yeah.  A minor problem?  I was hearing you weren't coming back or something.  Are you enjoying your new cubicle?  I love my new cubicle.  Are you a little pissed at us that we took over the office? 
[00:37:00]  Not at all.  That was the prized possession around here, the office that we're in.  Yeah.  It's in the corner.  You guys got the golden office, Ben.  Corner office, big window.  It's in the corner.  Overlooking 57.  No one could bother us.  We almost have like a private entrance.  It's perfect for us.  You guys got the power room.  We do have the power room.  That's good.  Both fridges fired up.  Keeping the beer cold.  I do need a kick.  Hey, Earl, did you get everything out of your desk?  Just about everything, yeah.  Maybe we ought to make sure everything's out of there. 
[00:37:30]  A half-drank bottle of Jack Daniels from Scotso.  Hey, Earl, I see you're in the cubicle.  Which one are you in?  The one nearest to the window?  Closest to the window.  Ah, think about that, Earl.  No one's going to have a clue what you're doing back there.  I love my new cubicle.  Because in the big office, you know, you were in plain sight.  Yeah.  You had to make believe you were busy, but now in that cubicle, oh boy, you could hear  I'm coming a mile away.  Earl, let's just take a random little sampling of his work day. 
[00:38:00]  Earl, what are you working on right now?  Right now, I'm trying to, well, the question I had for Ben was about chili pepper tickets.  Yeah?  You scalping them?  No, we want to buy them.  Oh, chili pepper tickets.  That'd be nice.  Yeah, we want to buy them.  He leaves me an email, and I just need to know how many pair we needed.  And then you would, what, go to work on buying the tickets?  Yeah.  All righty.  You going to be hanging any pictures in your cubicle? 
[00:38:30]  No, I'm not.  Yeah, that would take a while.  Well, Jason from Jersey on the instant feedback.  If it took Earl six hours to hang those pictures, then do you think he'll be finished moving his  stuff out before the end of the month?  For your information, guys, I'm already moved in.  Earl, did you hang your NEW employee of the month plaque up in your cubicle?  No, that's at home in a closet.  We were looking at that.  There's a big plaque with all the employees of the month.  From what year is that, Earl? 
[00:39:00]  It's like 1992.  Yeah, 92.  What employee of the month?  What month?  I think October.  Oh, we missed the anniversary.  We would have had a big celebration.  Were you a one-time winner?  I think I won twice.  Oh!  And what did you do above and beyond the Call of Duty those months that put you over the top?  Honestly, I had no idea.  I bet.  I couldn't remember.  We're all on the same page there. 
[00:39:30]  Rumor has it that they had Pete arrange the cubicle to hide you, Earl.  No, not at all.  No?  That's not true.  That's not true.  All right, Earl.  Now, are we allowed to call you Earl Coe?  Earl Coe.  You can call me whatever you want because you're going to call me that anyway.  Well, we started calling you Earl Coe because you were carrying around the nightstick.  The nightstick.  And you looked like the dude from Planet of the Apes there, Earl Coe. 
[00:40:00]  So we're asking your permission if we could maybe drop the black Earl and start calling you Earl Coe.  Earl Coe.  Earl Coe.  Actually, I kind of like black Earl just fine.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  All right, Earl Coe.  Could it be a side nickname maybe?  Like I said, you can guys can call me whatever you want because you're going to call me that anyway.  All right.  All right, Earl.  Well, Earl, we're kind of glad that you didn't quit for good.  Yeah.  No, no.  You had a little mental breakdown.  You needed a few days off, right?  Yes.  And now you're back. 
[00:40:30]  Yes, I'm back in the saddle.  All right.  We'll get back to the...  Anthony, just for the record, we're still working on your No Doubt ticket.  Thank you.  Thank you, Earl.  Was that a little dig at Anthony?  No, not at all.  I think it was, though.  No, God's honest truth.  That's the God's honest truth.  We are working on your No Doubt ticket.  Ben, is it all working out for you?  No Doubt tickets are the hardest tickets we've ever had to get.  No, I bet.  All right.  I told Hope this morning.  I didn't tell you yet.  All right.  Hold on.  Let's get rid of Earl.  Earl, thank you.  Thank you, guys. 
[00:41:00]  All right.  Well, if anything bothers you, you call back the show, all right?  All right.  From your little cubicle.  From Earl's Cubicle Live, it's Earl, everybody.  Thank you, Earl.  Thank you, guys.  Do you pop up like a weasel?  Kind of like the spook that sat by the door.  Oh, look at that.  I got to bell you.  Yeah, we didn't mean it like that.  But, you know, office workers can relate to the weasel.  You pop out of your cubicle, see what's going on, and you pop back down.  All right, Earl.  All righty.  Thank you.  All righty.  All right, Ben, tell Anthony about his No Doubt tickets. 
[00:41:30]  Of course, I need a couple of tickets to No Doubt at Roseland.  Now, let me explain.  Yeah.  If you remember, Anthony, I wanted Korn tickets.  Korn, yes.  For the show at the Coliseum.  Mm-hmm.  And I was talking highly about the band Korn, if you remember, right?  Yes.  How they're one of my favorite bands.  They're great live, and I really need to go see Korn.  Yeah.  Ben, how long did it take to get those tickets?  We still haven't got 100%, but it looks good for those.  Looks good, no problem.  Okay.  Now, your No Doubt tickets, Anthony. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  How's that going?  Remember when you admitted you needed a couple of No Doubt tickets?  Yes.  And then you went off on, like, an hour and a half rant.  Ragging me?  How faggy you are and how faggy the band is and stuff?  That's right.  I need two No Doubt tickets.  Not one.  I understand.  Not like old Ant is just going by himself to grope a few teenage girls, Opie.  We fully understand why you need them, but we went off on the rant.  Thank you.  You know, you gave us the opportunity.  We called you a fag, the band.  Everything's open here.  I'm not going to try to hide the fact. 
[00:42:30]  Well, I guess the record company didn't appreciate us talking down to their band.  What's the problem?  What happened?  So you will not be getting free, No Doubt ticket broker.  What happened?  The record company.  What?  Did you say ticket broker?  Oh, no.  Did they get upset at some of the stuff that was said here about No Doubt?  Well, that's what I'm hearing, yes, through my sources, Anthony.  Don't we know people at Roseland?  Jesus Christ.  We are having problems on every front imaginable getting these tickets.  We've made so many friends here in New York. 
[00:43:00]  In two years, Opie, we have alienated every single person in New York.  So you're going to pretty much have to see Four Finger Louie outside Roseland to get your No Doubt ticket.  The only source that is left to get these tickets is K-Rock.  Oh, good.  Let's go crawling over there.  No, thank you.  Oh, Will.  How are you doing?  I can get you some No Doubt ticket.  Oh, boy.  So there you have it.  All right.  Well, I'm eagerly looking forward to on that front tickets. 
[00:43:30]  Thank you.  All right.  We've got to get into what you did on vacation.  Oh, yeah.  We'll do that next.  Our phone number is 212-757-1027.  Opie.  Opie.  I have water retention.  Opie's on the rack.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  Opie, you are such a woman.  Oh, come on.  Opie, we're calling any duair.  Call me a fag.  Whatever.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah.  That's pretty gay, man.  Opie, you are such a woman.  Why am I such a fan?  Why am I such a fan? 
[00:44:00]  Usually I have to go to Christopher Street to see that.  I feel so sexy.  I'm a whip.  I'm a butt.  I like my vagina.  Opie, you are such a woman.  I have water retention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  I have water retention.  I'm feeling a little bloated today.  You wearing a bra?  Yeah.  That's pretty gay, man.  Yeah, I want to give Al Roker the rusty tuba.  Whatever you say on this ends up on some wacky coma.  You got me.  1027.  W-N-E-W. 
[00:44:30]  Let's wait and let this kick in.  Yeah.  Coal chamber.  Entwined.  All right, we're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony's show.  Hey.  I don't know what we're accomplishing today, but it sure feels good to be back, Anthony.  Nothing.  That is what we do on a daily basis.  After taking a week off.  Back off, huh?  A week off. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  A week off.  We're trying to, you know, figure out what's new around here.  Because a lot could change around here in a week, right?  Yeah.  You go on vacation.  You come back.  Little subtle things change.  Well, one thing I just noticed that's really scaring me a lot.  Spaz is in a suit today, Anthony.  He's wearing a suit.  Does Spaz get a promotion?  No.  Hold on vacation?  Thank God for that.  Could someone bring Spaz in so we can find out why he's wearing a suit today? 
[00:45:30]  Here comes Spaz, Anthony.  Dressing like he's ready for his first communion.  Dude, that's an ugly ass suit, man.  I like it.  Did you graduate in that suit?  No.  My graduation suit is sitting at home.  I bought a special suit for that.  How long have you had that?  I've had this suit since I was in seventh grade.  Seventh grade.  It looks it.  That's good.  That's a nice gray suit with the little buttons.  What's on the buttons?  Little brass buttons. 
[00:46:00]  That's something I don't know.  It's an anchor.  You've had that since seventh grade?  Yes.  I can't fit it into anything from seventh grade.  You were that tall and geeky in seventh grade?  Yeah.  You stopped growing after seventh grade?  Yeah, by seventh, eighth grade, yeah.  Man.  All right, Spaz, everyone is patiently waiting.  Why are you wearing a suit and tie today?  I lost a bet to Chara.  What was the bet?  Chara?  Yes.  Who was promoted, Anthony, since we've been gone? 
[00:46:30]  She's now working upstairs?  Really?  Yep.  Chara, you made a bet with Chara?  Yes.  And what was the bet?  The bet was that with the NCAA tournament, I bet that Iona would make it farther than Seton  Hall.  You are retarded, man.  Why would you take that bet?  Because I had confidence in the gals.  In the gals.  The gals.  Not much wind in those gals.  No.  They get close.  No, they ain't.  15 points. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, 15 points.  Close.  They let a girl beat you.  Yes.  That's great.  So I have to wear a suit for the whole week.  Actually, Chara's from Seton Hall, right?  Yes, she is.  So that's a fun little bet to do.  Now, what would have happened if you won?  She would have taken me out to lunch at a hard rock.  That's it, huh?  One day only.  One day only.  You have to wear the suit all week, I'm here, for a week.  Are you going to wear that same stupid?  What a one-sided bet.  No, no, not the same one.  I have to wear the same one on Friday, but I get to wear just a shirt tie and khakis on 
[00:47:30]  Tuesday and Thursday, a suit Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  She's dressing you.  Yes.  That's great.  We're going to start a new feature this week on the show.  It's called Spaz's Week in Review.  Spaz's Week in Review.  Yeah.  That's wonderful.  On Friday, he's going to have a nice little week in review of everything that happened in  the news, Anthony.  Tell us.  Oh, I like that.  You like that?  That little feature.  A giant mosquito was seen over Queens and it's paying the people. 
[00:48:00]  And we want him to have some commentary.  Yeah.  We want him to editorialize some of the stories that are in the news.  Of course.  You want the Spaz mind to dig into these stories.  So, Spaz, are you excited about your new feature?  Yes, I am.  And I figure it was time to get you more involved with the radio show.  I appreciate that.  And what were you going to say?  I'm sorry.  I was going to say that I already started working on something this past weekend.  Oh, look at that. 
[00:48:30]  A little extracurricular work.  And can you share with the audience?  Yeah.  I did actually some new segments that I did looking at the paper on Saturday.  I did some new segments.  An entertainment segment, a sports segment, and a political analytics segment.  Analystics.  Yes.  What is analytics?  Well, I analyzed politics in general.  And, um, what, you just did that at home? 
[00:49:00]  No, I did that here.  I just read the paper, and one of the articles in the paper sparked my mind to go.  Oh, you've got to watch that.  It's like a tumbleweed.  It sparked that mind.  I could burn up.  And I just did commentary on politics.  Would you like to share with us a little bit?  I really couldn't say it as good as I did on the tape.  So he taped it?  Wait, wait, wait.  You taped this?  Yes.  Well, where is it?  He gave me the tape.  Dude, what, are you crazy?  We'll have to play tomorrow, because it's on cassette and stuff. 
[00:49:30]  I also have it on shortcuts.  You have it on shortcuts?  Oh, look, he's just begging.  All right, how long is it?  It's 25 minutes.  25 minutes?  That could have been three hours.  We can cut each break up.  Each break is only about five minutes long.  I've got to hear a little bit.  All right.  Come on, just a taste.  Is it on this shortcut or the other one?  The other one.  I could switch it.  All right, we can switch during the commercial break.  Oh, yeah.  It could give us an idea of what we could expect with this new feature we can review at Spaz.  Sort of like a little special, what do they call that? 
[00:50:00]  A preliminary show.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, we'll do that.  What's the first story we're going to check out?  Well, I did News Around the World in the first segment.  News World.  Yours.  And then in the second segment, I did entertainment.  Entertainment.  Good.  The third segment, I did sports.  Okay.  And then the fourth, I did my political commentary.  All right.  Political commentary.  Political commentary on what?  Like the presidential race?  No, I did it on the Senate race and my views on politicians. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  I get my own personal opinions.  Is the White Hood going to interfere with the voice over the mic?  Are we able to politicize?  All right, man.  I can't wait to hear that.  Look, I am damn well looking forward to this.  Don't go anywhere.  All right.  So Spaz, wearing a suit for a week because he lost a bet.  Okay.  You and I both did horrible in the NCAA tournament.  My Purdue almost got into the Final Four.  Not one of our teams between us made it into the Final Four. 
[00:51:00]  No.  We both picked four separate teams.  Not one of them made it to the Final Four.  I hear it was very difficult to pick these four.  Well, yeah, there's two H-seeds in there, Anthony.  Yeah.  A couple shockers, sure.  Mm-hmm.  But we do have a winner for our contest.  Oh, yeah?  We're flying someone to the Final Four.  Do we have that winner?  Can we announce that right now?  We had over 4,000 entries for our contest, Ant.  It was real easy.  An easy contest.  All you had to do was pick who you thought was going to be in the Final Four, okay?  Right. 
[00:51:30]  I want to thank Mountain Dew, the fine people of Mountain Dew, for giving us this trip to give away.  And the winner picked three out of the four teams that made it to the Final Four.  The winner didn't even get four out of four?  No.  And she was the only one that got three out of four out of 4,000 entries, Anthony.  Wow.  So that is a rough contest.  Come on.  She picked Florida, North Carolina, Michigan State, and St. John's.  Obviously, St. John's being the one that didn't make it there, Ant.  So we've got to congratulate Darcy Duran of Greenwood Lake, New York. 
[00:52:00]  Congrats.  She's going to go see the Final Four live this coming weekend, courtesy of Opie and Anthony  and, of course, our pals at Mountain Dew.  Great.  All right.  We should get her on the phone and see if she's excited.  I am excited.  I am excited.  Thank you very much.  Very excited.  All right.  Let's go to Jammer.  Hey, Jammer.  What's going on, man?  Hey, what's going on, O.N.?  Welcome back from vacation.  Two things.  What? 
[00:52:30]  Limp?  Anthony's limp dick.  I don't know what you even...  Like, it didn't even sound like that.  What did he say?  Well, whatever that word is.  How do you spell that?  Oh, the...  Analyptic.  Analyptic.  That's what it is.  Analyptic.  Oh.  All right.  You're reaching it.  Anyway.  So, Ant, how was your long haul down to Florida?  Did you run into any Bufords?  Any Smokey to Bears?  No.  I got to tell you.  And let me tell you, I was going so fast. 
[00:53:00]  You got to make a commitment on a home trip.  Well, you keep it up with the big trucks.  Yes.  All right, Jammer.  We're going to let you go.  So, he's one of those guys you can't tell a story while they're on the phone.  Some people are cool.  They could sit.  You'd knock off a couple of things with them.  They'd come back on the phone with something.  That's the guy that's not listening to anything you're saying.  And it's just going to interrupt you about ten times when you're trying to tell your story.  So, Anthony, let's get into your vacation, okay?  Okay.  We discussed mine. 
[00:53:30]  I flew down to Turks and Caicos.  A little Club Med action.  Had a lot of fun.  Blah, blah, blah.  Mm-hmm.  You chose to drive to...  Drive to Florida.  Not just Florida.  Because, like, driving to Jacksonville is like, okay, not too bad.  You drove all the way to Miami.  Miami.  A couple of stops, though.  Me and the girl, he went down there.  Yeah.  Went to Orlando first.  Uh-huh.  But the drive down left Saturday late afternoon.  So the bulk of the driving is Saturday night into Sunday morning.  Not a big traffic time. 
[00:54:00]  You know what I mean?  A couple of drunks.  That's about it.  But when you're going to drive on a long trip, you have to make the commitment to speed.  What I mean by that?  You're going to drive 90 miles an hour.  Yeah, because you start doing the math and realizing if you're going to be on the road for ten straight hours and...  Ten miles an hour more?  Ten miles an hour.  Ten hours?  Huh.  You're whacking a huge chunk of time off your schedule.  That's what?  An extra hundred miles you just got in.  Right.  Sure.  Exactly.  So I figure that 90 miles an hour is a good speed. 
[00:54:30]  Now, when you make such a commitment, you can't be thinking about speed limit signs when they change 55, 65, 70.  It doesn't matter.  It's all 90.  You don't look for cops.  You don't use a radar detector.  You don't deal with...  No.  No.  No.  No.  Zen driving.  You make the commitment.  You're nuts.  You accept the consequences. 
[00:55:00]  That's it.  So you just drive fast.  And your trip will be a lot quicker.  Now, if you're going to go half-assed and say, oh, I'll slow down, I'll do this, I'll do...  Ain't going to work for you.  You're not going to knock off that huge chunk of time.  Not one cop pulled you over?  I'm amazed.  Opie?  Not one ticket.  I've done that ride to spring break a bunch of times.  You see a cop like every, I don't know, 10 miles.  After I got out of the WNEW listening range, I felt like, oh, I'm out of the compound. 
[00:55:30]  I can't pull that card.  I can't say, hey, you listen to Opie and Anthony?  We don't care about them, boy.  We've got to get syndicated all the way down the East Coast so you could drive to Miami safe.  Yes, exactly.  I need a complete overlapping listening radius the whole way.  I did come very close one time.  Yeah.  Doing, well, I'm not going fast at this point because there was construction and there was an Asian gentleman in front of me. 
[00:56:00]  You know, they do drive very well, the Asians, and they love to go fast, don't they, Opie?  I was cursing.  I'm behind this guy.  I can't get around him.  There's a guy behind me.  I'm behind the Oriental, the Asian man, and there's a carload of black gentlemen behind me.  The second the road opens up, I open up.  I'm flying now.  The black guys go around me.  They're going faster than I am, right?  Over the hill. 
[00:56:30]  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  Cop comes behind both of us.  I'm like, uh-oh, this is it.  They got me.  And they must have looked.  So it was black guys and decided to pull them over instead.  Oh, God.  Well, you know how they work down there, Opie.  So they pulled over the carload of black gentlemen, so thank you to them.  They took the heat off of me.  And I just got back up to 90.  Made it the whole way down very quickly.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Before you got to Florida.  Yeah.  Did you do the tourist thing and stop at south of the border? 
[00:57:00]  Oh, south of the border was like a blur.  It was a blur.  It went by so fast.  Let me tell you something.  I could not swipe my Amex card through the mobile gas pumps fast enough to get the gas in and get back on the way.  This was not a little pleasure trip.  This was bolting down there, setting records, moving.  You were pit stopping at all the gas stations.  That's it.  Yeah.  It was so fast.  It was ridiculous.  Spinning heads. 
[00:57:30]  So I made it down there.  15 hours.  Pretty quick.  Booking.  Made it down to Disney.  Hung out there for like three days.  That whole experience.  God damn, I love that place.  Welcome to Walt Disney World.  And Walt Disney Transportation Monorail.  Please step inside.  Listened to that guy like all three days.  Had a great time there.  And then went down to the Kennedy Space Center.  Where I looked at the rockets that I was so intrigued with as a child. 
[00:58:00]  Can't we back up to Disney World?  Oh, I got plenty of stuff on Disney.  You spread it out a little bit.  All right.  Go ahead.  Continue.  And then went down to Miami Beach and hung out on the beach.  Did you do some jet skiing with Ricky Martin?  Yes.  Ricky Martin was holding on tight.  A little fearful that he would fall off as I jet skied through the waves with Ricky Martin.  Yes.  Yes, Opie.  That's exactly what happened.  No.  No, I did the Disney thing.  Mm-hmm.  Three days.  Stayed there. 
[00:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  And we were talking about this earlier.  They got to update that place a little bit.  The Magic Kingdom, as it were.  Not some of the other ones.  They're building new parks like the Water Park and MGM and stuff like that.  But the Magic Kingdom?  Maybe it was Magic back in the 60s.  It's a little outdated.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Tomorrowland.  Welcome to Tomorrowland.  This is what the future will look like.  Maybe the 60s version of the future. 
[00:59:00]  Someday we will take a rocket ship to the moon.  Walt did it already.  It's frightening.  I like the, what's the ride, the Leagues Under the Sea thing?  20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  They actually got rid of that.  Oh, they did?  Yes, they did.  Oh, because last time I was at Disney World, I bought the myth, I guess.  I thought I was going 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  It's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  Look, there's a big mechanical squid in front of us.  Hey, wait, I can see the water.  It's like two feet above my head.  Wait, I see a lady with a stroller through the water. 
[00:59:30]  I thought we were 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  I know I got new eyes, courtesy of Dive Invision, but this is a little out of hand.  Now we dive down.  We are 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.  Wait a minute.  There's a kid throwing popcorn at the ducks, like right over my head.  You're crapping me here, right?  Come on.  So they finally got rid of that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then went over to Epcot and went on some of those wonderful attractions they have over there. 
[01:00:00]  Every country has their own restaurants and their own little attraction that tells you about their little country.  Sure.  And then there's the other scientific exhibits, like I went on one.  They're showing how to best use the land for planting, Opie, as you sit in a little moving cart.  Fun, fun, fun for everybody.  As some dweeb tells you, you know, is the tour guide.  Now we'll be taking you through the Disney facilities that use hydroponics and other types of alternatives to agriculture. 
[01:00:30]  Sponsored by Nestle.  And here we're showing how bean sprouts are grown in a soil that is completely deficient in vitamins just with a drip.  You know, these people working with Nestle scientists have developed a...  Hold the fuck.  At that point I perked up a little, like I was drooling a little.  Nestle, Nestle scientists.  Yeah. 
[01:01:00]  And I'm thinking, I'm thinking Nestle has scientists.  You go through all the crap you have to go through to become a scientist in school.  Do you know how chemistry class was?  Oh, boring and everything.  Oh, the elements and...  You finally become a scientist.  You're going to work for Nestle?  Like, do you get laughed at at the other science conventions with all the other scientists?  Look, here comes a Nestle scientist.  Hey, chocolate pie!  You can work on a cure for cancer or AIDS, but no. 
[01:01:30]  I've got to figure out how to get more almonds into that flat little chocolate bar.  That's my goal in life.  I'm a Nestle scientist.  How many ingredients are in chocolate anyway?  Oh, well, that's a bear's kept secret in Nestle.  Only the scientists know I'm a Nestle scientist, you know.  Can't be more than, I don't know, three.  Hey, Hershey Kiss guy, I figured out where the black hole is.  What'd you do?  Figure out how much foil's got to be used to wrap up those little kisses?  Good job.  How'd they get that string in there?  It's like a big silver tampon. 
[01:02:00]  Did the Nestle scientist come up with that one?  Hey, chocolate boy!  You know, he's just like the dregs of the scientist community.  That's funny.  Working.  Working with the Nestle scientist.  Scientists.  Yeah, so I went there through all those little things.  Had some fun.  And then went to a Kennedy Space Center.  It's just fabulous.  I don't think they acknowledge the Challenger blow up.  Oh, really?  Yeah, they don't want to...  Like, there's a tour bus, and you take the tour, it's like...  Hello, welcome to Kennedy Space Center.  Any questions?  Please direct them to me, the driver. 
[01:02:30]  My name's Ed, and I'll help you out with anything we need to help you with.  And I've been saying the exact same thing for the last five years.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, with all the hokey jokes.  So they're like, one person asks, so when did the Challenger explode?  Oh.  And he got all, like, you know, nervous and stuff, and he's like...  Oh, I can answer.  I'm tired of that.  All right, now, I'll see you in the lunch country that was used on the...  I was walking up.  They, like, don't want to acknowledge it anymore.  It's not even part of the tour.  They don't have any kind of a commemorative thing. 
[01:03:00]  A race from the history.  Yes.  So it went there, and then, like I said, Miami, where it was just nice.  And then back, the trip back.  Boom.  Again, commit to speed.  That's it.  All the way back, no tickets.  I use the force.  Like, I know when there's going to be a cop ahead.  And I don't slow down anyway.  Now, was there a reason why you didn't fly?  No, no reason.  I just didn't want to make any plans.  I know there's a reason.  What's their reason? 
[01:03:30]  I'm flying this weekend to Los Angeles.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  Because I've flown with you.  You don't...  First of all, you don't take well to fly in, Anthony.  Hold it.  I've been there.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah, go ahead.  Let me ask you something.  Okay.  Who flew better on the flight back from Turks and Caicos last time?  Me.  You were a mess.  Oh, dude, I'm just going to get sick.  I'm missing that.  Just bitching and complaining.  The first time we flew together, five years ago, out to L.A., yeah, I was bombed because 
[01:04:00]  I hadn't flown in quite a while.  That's just a funny story, though.  But that's sticking out in your head like it's every time now.  Well...  That's not the case.  Can I tell the story?  Oh, sure.  All right.  I was trying to pick up an 80-year-old broad.  No, I wasn't.  I wasn't picking her up.  She wasn't talking to me.  I couldn't shut her up.  She was as drunk as I was.  Let me tell the story, Anthony.  Ant and I barely knew each other, and somehow we finagled a way to get a radio show together, 
[01:04:30]  which just doesn't happen in this business.  Yeah, I don't know how that happened.  It sounds like Ant and I have known each other for like 20 years.  It's only been about seven, I think, we're up to now.  We're close to seven.  It's kind of a joke.  Yeah, so we talked the radio station into hiring us and making believe we were like best of friends and stuff.  But the fact of the matter was we had no clue who each other was.  Yeah.  We kind of enjoyed each other's company during a radio show, but as far as like our personal lives,  we had no idea what the other guy was about, okay?  Right.  So we moved to Massachusetts together, and we're staying at this house for a little while. 
[01:05:00]  And you were just a mess.  Come on.  There was a point I was convinced you might be a serial killer.  Oh, me.  Because me.  No, we didn't know anything about each other, okay?  Right.  And we had to fly to L.A.  This is after knowing each other barely a month, okay?  Uh-huh.  So we had the first flight out, right?  It was like 9 a.m. or so?  Very early, yes. 
[01:05:30]  So we got up around 6 a.m., if I'm not mistaken.  We had a couple hours to get to the airport.  Yeah.  I decided to do a little laundry, and Ant decided to hit the bottle.  Well, I had a couple of beers.  Calm down the pre-flight jitters.  First of all, 6 in the morning, you had...  And the time you drink is directly proportional to what time you plan on going to sleep.  It has no...  It has no bearing.  What is 6 in the morning when you're going to be flying all day? 
[01:06:00]  Okay.  Time is going to change anyway.  All right.  But this was my first impression of you.  You've got to understand.  Uh-huh.  I learned later in our little careers that you're not like this on a daily basis.  But basically, you woke up at 6 o'clock and popped a Budweiser, right?  Yeah.  It was, you know, common...  Taking the little jitters off.  Taking the little edge off.  Hadn't flown in a good probably 10 years.  Then you popped a second one, if I'm not mistaken.  Oh, yeah.  And a third, and I believe a fourth.  That's before we left the house, right?  Well, you can't just drink wine.  Well, I don't want to exaggerate the story, so... 
[01:06:30]  I probably have a cup.  If I'm a little out of line, let's say four?  Four before we even left?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know.  Because I was drinking...  That's too intoxicated to keep count.  Believe it or not, I was drinking...  No, I was drinking with you at the time.  Yes, you did have a couple.  I had a couple, and I know you were beating me two to one easily.  Okay.  So then we had to take the ride to the airport, and you snuck two more in your coat, if I'm not  mistaken, just for the ride to the airport.  Okay.  Are we still clear about what's going on here?  Yeah, we're pretty clear.  I'm pounding them.  Yeah, so by the time... 
[01:07:00]  You know, take the edge off.  Now, at this point, it's about 8 a.m., and then Ari has six beers in them.  Yeah.  I'm correct, right?  Right.  We're now on the plane, and you are just having...  Hey, I could drink, though, pal.  Well, I understand how that...  Six beers to me.  That's not...  That's only the story of the story.  It gets much better.  Okay.  So we're on the plane, and you're just...  Dude, I got to say...  Dude, what do you mean, freaking out?  You were freaking, remember...  I was totally not freaking out.  You were discussing everything that was going on with the aircraft.  Yeah, because I'm knowledgeable as to aircraft. 
[01:07:30]  No, you were like, okay, okay.  I go, ah, you hear that?  That's the...  They're getting ready for takeoff.  Oh, look, look, the flaps are up.  See?  They're lowering those things down to takeoff position.  Yeah.  You were...  Dude...  So?  I mean, you can be...  I'm discussing the takeoff procedure.  You'll have your chance to abuse me coming back to person, Kiko's.  But you will admit, because you haven't flown in a while, you were really freaked out.  I said I was nervous.  I wasn't freaked out.  Freaking out, you got me sounding like William Shatner in the Twilight Zone.  Oh, my God, there's a man on the wing!  There's a man on the wing!  But you were talking to complete strangers, basically, saying, okay, we're getting ready 
[01:08:00]  to take off.  That old...  No, I'm not...  You got it all wrong.  I'm turning to complete strangers going, okay, here we go.  Yes, you are!  I'm landing gear coming up.  You were like...  Absolutely not.  You were losing it.  Absolutely not.  Absolutely not.  I am totally disagreeing with this.  No.  All right.  It was not that crazy.  I had a good buzz going.  A very good buzz.  I'm talking with my pal, Opie, about what the aircraft is doing.  Every detail.  Oh, yeah, because I'm sitting next to Chuck Yeager here, who is just having a gay old 
[01:08:30]  time with his flight.  You were freaking out.  I wasn't as bad as you.  You're grabbing the hand things on the thing.  Oh, dude, oh, I hate to fly.  Oh, I hope I don't boof.  Oh, my God, I hate to...  Oh, and I'm just describing the actions of the plane.  And that's when you proceeded to have the rum and cokes.  Right.  Bring on the rum and cokes.  This is the best.  I mean, it has a little filling.  Is it fair to say it had six double rum and cokes?  It was between New York and halfway to L.A. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I would say six, sure.  On top of the six beers.  Yeah.  But it is now hours are going by.  And by the time the waitress brought the sixth drink, she did look at you funny, wondering  why you were still standing.  She said, are you okay?  Yeah, because she was amazed that anyone could drink this much in the sky and not be affected,  because at this point you were not affected.  Well, I would just ask her for a drink.  Because you were just completely living off adrenaline at this point or something, because  you were not getting drunk. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  I think, yeah, at that point maybe adrenaline.  Right.  Okay.  Then I realized that you might have a little buzz, because Anne's not, in general, you're  not the most social person when it comes to strangers, right?  Is that fair to say?  If we're out with our listeners, that's a different story and stuff.  You're pretty sociable and stuff.  Okay.  Right.  You got up out of your seat somewhere over Denver and decided to, in my opinion,  Yeah, okay.  Tell me if I'm wrong.  All right.  Flirt with an 80-year-old woman that didn't have teeth. 
[01:10:00]  Absolutely wrong.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  I'll tell you exactly what happened.  Okay.  I'll tell you exactly what happened.  Because that was the most bizarre thing.  I'm like, why is he like, because it wasn't just like a quick high on the way to the bathroom  or something.  You decided, if I'm wrong, tell me.  Just sit right next to her for a very, right, long time.  Right.  Wait, dude, you can't say that.  All right, come on.  No, no, look. 
[01:10:30]  What I did, I, the people on the phone's laughing.  Wow.  No, what I did was I took, I took a look around the aircraft.  I saw there was a window seat opened.  Mm-hmm.  I wanted to look out the window.  Okay.  So I staggered over to that chair and I sat down.  It happened to be next to an elderly lady.  Mm-hmm.  But I didn't go there to talk to her.  I went there to look out the window because there was a window seat open.  You ended up discussing your life with her. 
[01:11:00]  All of a sudden, well, she, you know how old ladies are.  Bip, bip, bip, bip, bip.  You sit next to her.  That's probably why the seat was open.  The last guy jumped.  He couldn't take it.  You know how the old ladies get to yapping.  And my son, let me tell you about what he does.  He's done that.  And you're like, shut up.  Shut up.  So I'm just sitting there looking out the window.  And she started talking to me.  So, yeah, what am I going to do?  F off, old bitch.  No.  I'm being social.  I'll talk to her.  That's all.  I wasn't trying to pick up an 80-year-old woman. 
[01:11:30]  And then it was funny because you were completely sober and stuff, even though you had a lot to drink.  And then, like, we landed in L.A.  And all of a sudden, I guess the adrenaline, like, calmed down in you.  Oh, I had to crash.  I was so hungover at that point.  I had to go to the hotel and crash out.  You, like, went out with Rick, I guess.  You were hanging out.  Yeah, we did Sunset Boulevard stuff.  We were all pumped that you couldn't make it to that point.  At that point, I think bed was the best thing.  Bed.  Bed.  You were done. 
[01:12:00]  Bed.  All right.  But that was the first time I'd flown in 10 years.  And then after that, oh, we have flown so many times.  Think of the little hop flights we did to Washington.  And then the flight from Boston to New York.  And then the flight to Atlanta.  Yeah, I mean, come on.  In all fairness, it's the first time.  It was just like, man.  But now it's ingrained in your head like I'm William Shatner.  Oh, my God.  Did you see that?  You see that?  Man on the wing.  There's a man on the wing. 
[01:12:30]  I don't do well with flying at all.  Yeah.  See, when I was flying down to Turks and Caicos, it's a quick, I don't know, three and  a half hours from JFK, direct flight, don't have to change or nothing.  And I'm sitting there in, like, the fifth aisle.  And all of a sudden, like, the cockpit door opens.  Yeah.  And one of the pilots walks out and goes to the bathroom.  And I swear to God, I had a complete panic attack.  I'm like, like there's a leak on the instruments.  But at this point, I'm like, this drastically increases our odds of crashing. 
[01:13:00]  Do you people realize this?  Oh, something happens to the pilot while I'm in there?  Yeah.  You're like, wait, taking away 50% of the people up there that do the work.  Right.  I'm like, what if the pilot gets, you know, locked in the bathroom or something?  The other guy has a heart attack.  It could happen.  A bathroom.  I can't get out of here.  It could happen.  Ladies and gentlemen, I seem to be trapped in the bathroom.  The captain seems to have suffered a fatal heart attack.  And I can't really pilot the plane from back here.  Somebody could maybe grab the stick and I'll try to give me this lot. 
[01:13:30]  You just don't want to see one of your pilots getting out of the cockpit.  It's just something that really freaks me out.  Did he at least look official like a pilot?  Yeah.  That's what gets me.  When they don't look official?  I don't like that at all.  Or call me whatever you want, but when I see the female pilot, I have a tough time with that.  I know it's not a cool thing to say, but that just doesn't make me personally feel secure.  I want the pilot that had, like, the war experience and the fighter planes. 
[01:14:00]  Hawk was painted under his canopy of his F-15.  I'm Hawk.  Now I fly over United.  You know, that guy.  Because he could take anything.  What's a total hydraulic failure?  It doesn't matter to me.  I had my tail shot off.  I landed on the goddamn carrier deck.  You know, that's what I want.  Sure.  I don't want, hi, I'm Susie, your pilot.  Oh, where did she learn?  Right.  Women aren't allowed to fly in combat.  I want a combat season pilot. 
[01:14:30]  I might sound sexist.  I know.  It's a horrible thing.  But you tell me.  Personally, I just feel more secure if it's...  Who did you?  The only chick I want flying a plane is that, like, transport pilot from Aliens 2.  Remember her?  Yeah.  We're in the pipe.  Five by five.  I'm detecting a leak and check the chick's...  Got it.  She was cool.  I wouldn't mind her in there.  Anything other than that, no.  I need the guy in there.  So then the pilot's in the bathroom and he's taking a really long time. 
[01:15:00]  Like, why the hell is this guy taking a long time?  Leave the intercom on...  And then finally, you know, he left the bathroom and went back in.  And then I felt safe and secure again.  And I'm like, okay, our odds are much better now.  There's two people up there.  Yeah, you never know.  So then the flight back. 
[01:15:30]  That's always the worst.  The trip back sucks.  Your vacation's over.  It just takes longer.  No, I don't even care about that.  But why does it always feel like you're safer when you fly in the middle of the day and it's bright, sunny skies compared to flying in the middle of the night?  Well, maybe because you take the visual aspect out of the whole thing.  You have no...  Maybe you might as well just blindfold the pilot.  You have no freaking clue how high off the ground you are. 
[01:16:00]  And that alone just freaks me out.  They know up front.  They've got all their instruments.  No, I understand.  They know.  But it's all this stupid crap in my head that bothers me.  Well, you should get drunk and talk to 80-year-old drunk.  It's your mind off the whole shindig.  So we fly.  We leave Turks and Caicos at 1 a.m.  Yeah.  And it's the middle of the night, basically.  Okay?  And I'm like, ah, this is a piece of cake.  It's three, three and a half hour flight.  I'll just sleep.  And by the time we're close to JFK, I'll wake up feeling great to start the day. 
[01:16:30]  Right?  Right.  So I take my little two-by-two pillow.  Like an airline pillow.  What's with these pillows?  Why can't they make a bigger airline pillow, grandma?  They might as well just call it like an ear pillow, you know?  Yeah, that's all it is.  And I prop myself up against the window there, Anthony.  I'm out cold for a good, I'd say, four minutes.  Because then, like, you know, when you're in between awake and asleep, your mind plays  some weird tricks on you.  Uh-huh.  And I'm like, huh, I'm really tired and sleepy. 
[01:17:00]  And it's like in the middle of the night.  And then I start thinking, what if the pilot's tired?  He's tired.  Well, like when you're driving for a long time and you're just, you're dozing?  Yeah, and you're just convinced the driver's dozing, too.  Because if you're sleepy, everyone must be sleeping, you know?  So he's just going to crap out.  So I am like, I jump up wide awake.  It's like 1.15 at this point, whatever.  And I'm like, screw that.  I'm not sleeping awake.  Turn on my stupid reading lamp and proceed to read 150 pages of a book that was really boring. 
[01:17:30]  Oh.  While the whole plane, because we had like two or three hours to kill before we went on the plane.  Yeah.  Just comatose.  Susan.  They're drinking and partying before we hit the plane last night of vacation.  So they're just out cold.  I'm the only one away.  Snoozing.  Oh, dude.  Wide awake, too.  I can't let you know.  You know what it is?  It's too much thinking.  Do drinking, not thinking when you're flying.  Because I know what you mean. 
[01:18:00]  You'll be sitting there.  All of a sudden, you'll be, I'm going to, I think I'm going to take a snooze.  I'm a little tired.  Oh, my God.  We're hurtling through the cosmos.  I'm 35,000 feet off the ground.  I'm doing about five bills.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  You know, the ground is way down there, and I'm sleeping.  But you're not even sure if the ground is way down there.  What if we're only 100 feet off the ground, and the pilot's not going to tell us, because  he figures...  Oh, you'll hear from the front.  They figured, you know, at that point, might as well let you die in peace. 
[01:18:30]  Why tell you if they're 100 feet off the ground, and they're going to crash?  That's one thing good about aircraft.  You'll know if you're in trouble, because from the cockpit, you'll hear a sound like  somebody dumped some water on a Casio keyboard.  It just will start making the wackiest sounds.  Do, do, do, do, do.  Out the door.  Out the door.  Out the door.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Like, what the hell is that?  Hey, Bob, what's going on?  Hey, Bob. 
[01:19:00]  Do we know Bob?  Yeah.  Hey, Bob, yeah.  Oh, Bob, call back.  Your phone sucks.  If you call back, we'll get you right on, all right?  Oh, well.  He had a good story about a pilot being locked out of the cockpit.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  That's got to be a little disturbed.  He's trying inconspicuously to jimmy it with his credit card.  Right.  Don't look up here.  Well, that was the other thing that went through my mind, though, when the guy got out of the  the bathroom, I'm like, okay, thank God.  You know, he had to push a code.  I'm like, what if he forgets the code and the other guy has to get up to let him back 
[01:19:30]  in?  Hey, stop screwing around, man.  You know, a couple of guys hanging out.  Who is it?  Shut up, man.  Let me get it.  All right.  Well, there you are.  I mean, come on.  So, we'll see.  We'll have a total blow-by-blow from next week when we get back.  We'll see who handles it better.  Yeah, we have to fly out to L.A. Saturday.  Yeah, I'm going to be drinking.  Don't worry about it.  I'm not going to get as tanked as I did that first flight.  I got the secret weapon for this flight.  What, Valium?  Yeah. 
[01:20:00]  Who gives you Valium now?  No, no, no.  Oh, my God.  Some listener calling out, dude, what can I get you?  Don't even start that real record.  That's good.  I'm going to boot up some heroin on the ramp.  I had a few left over from a certain procedure.  Let's just put it at that.  Oh, there you go.  And that's all that is about.  All right.  Is that what you did?  Did you take any on the way down?  No, I only had a couple left.  I had to, like, figure out the exact...  You got to save them.  I had to save them.  I got to save these.  I got one left.  I'm debating.  Should I take it on the way to L.A. or the way back? 
[01:20:30]  Look at the weather.  If it's a little bumpy.  Don't start the Valium rumor.  Does it sound like I'm on Valium?  Oh, well.  No, of course not.  All right.  Let's take a break, okay?  All right.  We are so freaking late.  Yeah.  Good.  I got to take a leak.  A lot of people want to ask about It's a Small World.  Oh, my God.  And your online trading live from Disney World.  I had to get a trade in.  And other things to discuss. 
[01:21:00]  We still have to talk about the Academy Awards as well.  And the GIMP.  King GIMP.  King GIMP.  We'll get into the stuff.  Highlight of the show.  We'll get into the stuff in just a bit.  Yeah, let's do that.  And all this week, we have tickets to the Mets home opener.  Homo?  Home opener.  You said Mets.  Now, let me explain something, okay?  We came up with this concept where we wanted to get 100 of our faithful listeners together for opening day.  That sounds pretty good. 
[01:21:30]  Ant and I were supposed to be there, but...  What's this supposed to?  But we're flying back from L.A.  So, in our place, it's going to be Psycho Mark.  But we had this great idea.  We'd bring 100 of our listeners.  I know.  Sorry about drinking.  So, we had this great concept.  You and I were going to go to opening day with 100 of our listeners.  All sit together and just be complete buffoons.  I like it.  All right?  We still have a ton of tickets to give away.  About 100.  Wow.  Close to 100.  Psycho Mark's going to go.  Opening day is, what, a week from today? 
[01:22:00]  Mm-hmm.  And it was kind of hard to get 100 tickets in one area.  In one place, huh?  Like, you just can't get 100 tickets behind home plate, if you know what I'm saying.  Right.  So, we don't want any bitching, if you know what I'm saying.  Oh, okay.  All right?  Here's what you'll hear.  Yeah.  You'll see our plane.  That's cool.  Give a knock on the bottom of the fuselage when we pass over, Shay. 
[01:22:30]  Well, pretty much, yeah, yeah.  We'll be at the game, and all of a sudden, you'll look up and go, hey, looks like Anthony's having another rubbing cup.  But we meant well.  It's still going to be a great time.  You're going to be there with 100 of our listeners.  Psycho Mark, wow signs.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Pandemonium.  But we want to warn you, you know, in advance, because we don't want you guys, you know, bitching and complaining about, you know, the seats.  You're still going to have a good time.  I mean, they're not that horrendous, but they're, you know, they're higher up. 
[01:23:00]  Sure.  Okay?  But we're still happy about this, Anthony.  Of course.  It's going to be fun.  Come on.  So we're going to give away.  How about we do this, because we were supposed to give one away last hour.  We'll give away two four-packs.  So if you've got some friends that could go with you, we'll give out two sets of four.  Okay?  All right.  And we'll give that to the 10th and 11th callers right now at 212-757-1027, courtesy of smallworld.com.  It's easy to play, and it's free.  So check out their website as well.  They gave us the tickets, and we want to thank them. 
[01:23:30]  All right?  Right.  We'll be back.  Stay there.  Hey, it's Joe Piscopo on 1027.  As the chairman of the board might say, Opie and Anthony, you are two groovy cats.  I love you, baby.  You knock me out.  Wonderful.  Marvelous.  Beautiful.  Cuckoo.  Wonderful.  Marvelous.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  I'm done.  What a douchebag.  Trainwreck radio.  Stand over.  This is sicker than faces of death.  1027-WNEW. 
[01:24:00]  All right, we should go to the phone.  We've been battling.  First day back from vacation.  212-757-1027.  Let's make sure people realize what am I trying to say here.  We're still doing the Most Offensive Song Contest, Anthony.  We did not forget about the Most Offensive Song Contest while we were away.  Oh, no.  I was going through a lot of the latest entries in the office before today's show, and I must 
[01:24:30]  say, none that we can play on the air.  No, not that they're too offensive.  That's not the case.  They're just horrible quality to the point where you can't even hear the song.  You can't hear what they're trying to say.  If you're going to do a goofy song, you've got to understand what the words are.  Yeah.  Correct.  Come on.  Yeah, I mean, and the entries we have now, I mean, you've got to be on that level to 
[01:25:00]  just make it on the radio.  You've got to be just unbelievable.  You've got to be as good as Kill a Fetus.  Yeah.  You have to be as good as Baby Raper.  Oh, yeah.  The KKK Man.  That's huge.  Camp Concentration.  Which one am I missing?  There's one more in there.  Baby Raper.  Kill a Fetus.  Camp Concentration.  KKK Man.  Is that it?  If Steve's listening from the unofficial website, call us, because I'm trying to remember all 
[01:25:30]  of them.  You should vote for your favorite on the site.  Online.  And I haven't heard Camp Concentration in 10 days.  Are you going to hear it?  Yeah.  Just to give the people an example of, you know, one of the songs that have made it all  the way to the radio.  Yeah.  This is for the most offensive song contest that we're doing.  And if your song doesn't come close to this as far as catchy, entertaining, offensive,  sound quality, it's nice and clear, you understand what this fine person is trying to say, then 
[01:26:00]  don't even bother sending in your most offensive song at this point, okay?  Absolutely.  And I believe the contest is going to be over in a couple weeks, so you've got to hurry  up with your entries and get them into our radio show, all right?  Mm-hmm.  But let's play really fast here, Anthony.  Once again, Camp Concentration.  Yeah.  By Fuel.  Welcome to Camp Concentration.  We've been set here because we're bad.  The curer says we're never leaving.  But there's lots of fun still to be had. 
[01:26:30]  Activities.  Today we're working on the chains.  It's hard, but they're teaching me how.  Has anybody seen my mother?  Her shower should be finished by now.  Home Mechanomics.  Today they're teaching me cooking.  And boy, these ovens are big. 
[01:27:00]  Has anybody seen my father?  I made this specially for him.  Welcome to Camp Concentration.  We've been set here because we're bad.  The curer says we're never leaving.  But there's lots of fun still to be had.  Here's Ed.  Today they taught me a new game.  It's so much better than tag. 
[01:27:30]  We dug a big hole in the ground.  And filled it with thousands of bags.  I think I won.  I think I won.  Science.  Tomorrow should be exciting.  Science is my favorite class.  They're taking me to a special lab.  They're taking me to a special lab.  Where I'm learning all about cats.  Welcome to Camp Concentration. 
[01:28:00]  We've been set here because we're bad.  The curer says we're never leaving.  But there's lots of fun still to be had.  Welcome to Camp Concentration.  We've been set here because we're bad.  The curer says we're never leaving.  But there's lots of fun still to be had.  All right, there you have it.  One of the songs that's in the running for the Most Offensive Song Contest. 
[01:28:30]  Okay, terrific.  Yeah, I miss that guy.  I was saying that on vacation.  Okay, you should see what was stuck in my head on vacation.  Really?  What?  Oh, my God.  Well, one of the entries to the Most Offensive Song Contest.  Would that be the KKK, man?  The KKK song.  Very catchy song, Anthony.  I'm humming it like crazy.  Sitting in a Denny's.  Humming away. 
[01:29:00]  You sure it wasn't a Popeye's?  Sound different.  All right, let's go to Steve.  Steve from the unofficial Opium Anthony website.  Hello, fellas.  How are you?  Hello, Steve.  Welcome back.  I hope your vacations were restful.  Lovely.  It was.  Very nice.  I think I sucked in too much oxygen during my diving because I feel high as a kite right  now.  You didn't get the bends, did you?  No, not at all.  Oh, that's good.  So, what song am I forgetting?  What'd you say?  Well, here's the ones I've got. 
[01:29:30]  Okay.  Baby Raper.  She Smells Strange.  Yeah, people don't like She Smells Strange.  No, no.  That one got about, what, 12 votes, I think.  28 votes.  I'm sorry.  The KKK Man.  Camp Concentration.  Kill a Fetus.  How Much Is That Darky.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And the Barry Manilow song.  Okay, yeah.  The one I guess we're forgetting is FBA, but officially that's not in the contest?  No.  That was the song that started the most offensive song contest, but Mike D. Nicola wants to 
[01:30:00]  enter that song because he wrote it, but the version we have is Stephen Lynch helping  him out, and Stephen Lynch doesn't want anything to do with that song, and I understand  why he wouldn't want anything to do with that song.  No.  No.  Well, if Mike would like to re-record a version, I'm sure we could get it up.  Yeah, that's what we're hoping for, that Mike D. Nicola re-records the song, and then  it could be in the running for sure.  Yeah.  For sure.  Exactly.  I'll tell you, the KKK man is just destroying the competition here. 
[01:30:30]  Wow.  Even Baby Raper?  I put Baby Raper, Baby Raper just ran away with it the first time I had the voting up,  and the second time I put Baby Raper up again, and up against She Smell Strange, the KKK man  in a camp concentration, and KKK man ran with it.  Are you doing kind of like a battle of the bands on your website there, Steve?  Yeah.  Remember the old-time radio?  Exactly.  All right, who do you want to vote for, Rush, Spirit of Radio, or Led Zeppelin, Cashmere?  And then you play both songs, and you take written calls all night long? 
[01:31:00]  That's exactly what it is.  And then that song moves on to the next round?  Yep.  God, radio useless.  Yeah.  Exactly what it is.  Tonight, it's going to be Spirit of the Radio against Pink Floyd, Comfortably Dumb.  I heard some people doing that.  Hey, here he comes.  It's Moby again.  And I'm listening to this going, well, what are they doing?  Yeah.  This is the worst type of radio I've ever heard.  Well, KKK man has run with it, officially.  I mean, 473 votes in six days. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  And the closest thing was Baby Raper again, and that was 237 votes.  All right.  Wow.  You're just kind of having a preliminary voting, because I think officially we want to have  a live show where we have the listeners decide which song is the most offensive.  Oh, absolutely.  But some of the people don't even want to perform their songs live, I'm finding out.  Oh, no.  So we have all sorts of problems with this content.  Maybe we could do it like the Oscars did it.  We'll have other people come up and perform the songs.  That's not a bad idea.  We could bring them up to stage with armed escorts. 
[01:32:00]  Is Robin Williams available to sing FBA?  Nigga, nigga, nigga, hanging from a tree.  You could sing the KKK song.  Well, we'll figure something out.  Maybe if the people, they'll perform live, but maybe we'll put bags on their head or have  them perform behind a wall so no one knows who they are.  Yeah.  That's a good idea.  They'll perform behind bulletproof glass.  Yeah.  Jeez.  All right.  But people could vote on foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  All right.  It's going to be back up.  And we're also going to start the voting for the next girl of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:32:30]  Very good.  Wow.  Who's that girl up there?  Oh, there's some cuties.  I've seen, I logged on and saw the girl that's, whoa, she's got a little weight to her.  But she's very proud of that bod because she's showing it off.  Well, she must be getting some fan mail because she sent us some more pictures.  Fan mail from some flounder?  Interesting.  All right.  The girls of O&A.  Yeah.  That has a long way to go. 
[01:33:00]  Oofa.  Oh, my God.  Rick asked me to maintain contact with a few of them so they might be able to enter your  little ugly ass competition.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Yeah.  It's amazing how they didn't respond too favorably to that.  Oh, no.  They think they're hot.  Why not?  We are doing the ugly ass competition at the next road show.  I think we're going to nail down a place maybe by the end of the week.  Cool.  We want to try to get something going by mid-April.  Beauty.  All right, Steve. 
[01:33:30]  All right, guys.  I encourage everyone to go to foundrymusic.com.  All right.  Take it easy.  Thanks, bro.  Yeah.  It'll be something we talked about just a little earlier about flying and stuff.  Yes.  But Frank has a great take on this.  Frank from Manhattan on the instant feedback.  Talking about male pilots, we want the guy pilot up there.  I always talk about the seasoned veteran pilot instead of the little scrawny guy or the woman  up front.  Sounds sexist, but it's just the way it is.  Frank says, I totally agree.  I fly a lot for business.  When I see the grizzled veteran, I feel so much better. 
[01:34:00]  You know, this guy flew high F4s downtown to Hanoi and Haiphong with a wicked hangover  from banging Vietnamese whores all night on dozens of missions, dodging missiles and  triple A fire.  So a little turbulence, no sweat.  The guy's right.  So when I see a 12-year-old kid pilot with scrawny arms or even wears a chick, I freak.  I can't stand here in that whiny female voice welcoming me to fly whatever.  I feel like I should put my head between my legs and kiss my ass goodbye.  It's true. 
[01:34:30]  That's absolutely true, though.  You want a guy that could take anti-aircraft fire after banging Vietnamese whores all night?  Whores.  I love the whole image that conjures up.  Just some guy, let me put this back, take it out of here, put it in my pants, and fly  a mission.  Fly a mission.  All right.  Darcy.  Yeah?  You're the NCAA winner, right?  I guess so.  All right.  Did you just find out live on the radio?  No, I didn't, actually.  My brother-in-law called me.  Oh, cool.  Well, congratulations. 
[01:35:00]  You're flying down there to see the Final Four live this weekend.  Cool.  You won our NCAA tournament.  You got three out of the four Final Four teams.  Three out of four.  The only one you missed was you thought St. John's would make it.  Oh, well.  You picked Florida, North Carolina, Michigan State.  Did you have any help with these picks, Darcy?  Actually, no.  It was completely random.  Completely random.  Yeah.  That's the way to do it.  See?  I almost got in there with that completely random thing.  Darcy, you realize you kicked Anthony and I's asses.  Cool be. 
[01:35:30]  Not one of our teams between us made it into the Final Four.  We had eight separate picks between us.  Now, Obie, what?  Separate teams.  Remind us of what she picked.  Florida.  Okay.  North Carolina.  All right.  He looked really good yesterday.  Michigan State.  Yeah.  And St. John's.  Now, if I would have picked those before this whole thing, would you have laughed at me?  Yeah.  Okay.  See?  That's all I'm saying.  Oh, yeah.  Darcy beat everyone.  We had 4,000 entries.  Really?  You were the only one that got three out of the four.  There were a ton of people that got, you know, two out of the four. 
[01:36:00]  Right.  But you're the winner.  I got four for four.  You got three out of four.  Three out of four.  And you're going to be flying down there to see the Final Four live.  Indianapolis, right?  Okay.  All right.  Hold on a lot.  I think Ben wants to talk to you, but congratulations.  Great.  Thanks a lot.  Once again, I want to thank the fine people at Mountain Dew for giving us this trip to  give away.  All right?  Yep.  All right.  Thank you, Darcy.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  All right, Anthony, we've got to take another break here.  We've got to get into the Oscars next.  We'll talk about King Gimp.  King Gimp rocked.  And we'll talk about whatever else you guys saw during the Oscars. 
[01:36:30]  The hit of the Oscars last night was King Gimp.  Also on the way, I'm trying to find the KKK man song.  Is it on CD?  Because it's on the other machine.  I want to go to commercials with that, but...  All right.  We'll play it out of spots, I guess.  All right, Anthony?  Oh, yeah.  Also, because we were away for a week and we were out of touch, we really didn't watch  TV or read newspapers and stuff.  Yeah.  So we really don't know what happened the last week.  Hmm.  I think Spaz is going to help us out.  He made a demo tape Saturday, and he's discussing the news. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, great.  I could catch up that way.  And it just happens to be all the news events that we miss while being on vacation.  Any giant mosquitoes or anything?  Are they invading?  I hear Queens is having a problem already with that.  We'll have to find out.  But Spaz, working his ass off because Rick's on vacation, quickly found the KKK man for  us.  I almost got my tie stuck in a CD player.  So we don't want to tease this.  No.  Instead of making you wait, here it is.  He's the leader in the most offensive song to ever air on our show contest. 
[01:37:30]  On any radio show.  On any radio show.  Yeah, this is really offensive.  The winner of this contest, we will be sending the song to the Guinness Book of World Records  to get it in the Guinness Book of World Records book.  And remember, Opie and Anthony or any W do not condone blah, blah, blah, anything on  the song.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And you only have a few weeks to try to beat, it looks like, this song as the voting's  going on currently.  All right, everybody.  Gather in. 
[01:38:00]  The Ku Klux Klan's here.  What kind of niggas you want?  Bird niggas.  Hang niggas.  Nappy head niggas.  Concrete niggas in cement shoes.  Anything you want.  You come to the right man.

[01:41:00]  1027.  WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Our phone line 212-757-1027.  Oh, the phone's just exploding, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  All right, hold on.  Let's go to Lenny.  Lenny, what's going on, man?  Lenny.  What is that?  I like that.  Hold on.  Hold on, Lenny.  Oh, my God.  Cursing all over the place.  Cursing.  Sorry, sorry, sorry.  Start over.  What's the deal?  That was the funniest song I've heard in a very long time.  Oh, it's not meant to be funny. 
[01:41:30]  It's offensive.  It's meant to be offensive.  We're not having the funniest song contest.  No.  We're not having the most offensive song contest.  And, of course, to win the contest, it has to be offensive.  Yeah.  I think that song fits the criteria.  Now, if your song can't compare to the two songs we just played.  Oh, my God.  Then don't bother sending it in.  We're only going to play the ones that could come close to what we just heard.  Right.  On the air.  Hence, no new songs today.  We went through about 25 tapes today. 
[01:42:00]  Couldn't cut it.  Couldn't cut it.  None worth making it on the air like that.  That was more offensive than the baby one?  Nothing that's right.  It's in the running.  Yeah, a lot of people think that's the most offensive song right there.  I listen to you guys every day on the way home from school, and I never get to hear that song.  Which one?  The baby one.  Oh, maybe we'll play it later on.  We've got lots of new stuff to get to today, but we'll try to fit it in.  Cool, man.  Submitation now.  Thank you, Lenny.  Bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Frank.  Frank, you're next on WNAW. 
[01:42:30]  What's up?  Oh, that was an offensive song I've ever heard my whole life.  Yeah, it's pretty horrible.  It was one from the baby song.  Yeah.  I was disgusting.  Well, according to the unofficial website, because you can vote for the most offensive song,  so we can all get an idea how all the songs are doing, that one's clearly in the lead.  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  All right.  It just gets uglier and uglier as the song goes on.  Oh, yeah.  And Anthony's on vacation in all over Florida humming that song.  He couldn't get it out of his head.  That was awful.  All right, Frank. 
[01:43:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, you guys suck.  All right, cool.  Bye.  Bye.  Sometimes, no matter how bad they are, offensive, they are catchy and stick in your head.  Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  All right, let's go to Malcolm.  Malcolm, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I'm not listening to the show right now, but I'm watching the news.  And on a live shot, I just saw your big red wow go by.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, man.  He put it on their plane, and they played it there.  You could see it just as plain, and then he ran it back by.  Wait, a ton of people calling in saying that big old wow sign on Channel 7. 
[01:43:30]  Nice.  Channel 7 out in Queens, yeah.  What was the news report?  It was about some kind of bias attack out in Queens.  And what, the reporter live, and all of a sudden did the guy?  He was live, and he came right from behind her and showed it.  Right in front of her face?  Right behind her.  Right behind her?  Right behind her.  You ought to try and find that guy and give him something.  He did a great job.  Well, you know the deal.  If you do that and you identify yourself, and it is indeed you, we invite you down to the station, hang out, give you some prizes.  Yeah, hook you up with lots of great stuff. 
[01:44:00]  I was kind of bummed that our faithful listeners, I heard that the wowing was awfully quiet  while we were on vacation.  Oh, yeah?  Well, everybody else probably went on vacation, too.  But now it looks, look, first day back, and all of a sudden we got another wow.  All right.  I'm good.  You know what I'm disappointed in?  The guy with the gorilla suit has never contacted us to come down here and claim his prizes.  That would have to be the funniest thing ever.  The best wowing so far, guy in a gorilla suit live on Channel 2.  What was he screaming?  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  As he's jumping up and down in a gorilla suit with a wow sign live on TV as they're trying to do a serious news report. 
[01:44:30]  Okay, terrific.  That's great.  Come on.  All right, let's go to Lainey.  Lainey, what's going on?  Yeah, guys, I was just calling to tell you the same thing, but the sign was, I swear, I'm saying it was like four feet tall.  Really?  Yeah, it was big, man.  All right, we're going to just sit back and then see who claims responsibility for this latest wowing.  Very cool.  Thank you, Lainey.  Send a case now, guys.  All right, cool.  Bye.  Bye.  Well, everyone's calling in about that. 
[01:45:00]  They don't want to talk about anything else.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  You saw the wow, too, on Channel 7?  Yeah, I did.  Was it huge?  It was huge, and it was like, this lady was in back of a basketball court, and this guy was just walking across the basketball court with a wow sign.  All the kids were looking at him.  It was great.  Cool.  Cool.  Yeah.  All right, thank you.  Thanks for that.  Send a case now, guys.  All right, thank you, Chris.  All right, bye.  All right, let's go to Stan.  Stan, you're next on N.E.W.  Hey, Stan.  Hello.  What's up, buddy? 
[01:45:30]  Oh, this is Dan.  Oh, Dan, sorry about that.  How are you guys doing?  All right, good.  Good.  Yeah, I was just calling about the wow sign on Channel 7 also.  They had Michelle Charlesworth was doing a live report up in Orbindale about some bias attack.  Yeah.  There's a whole bunch of kids playing basketball.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, right behind her, this guy's got a big cardboard sign.  It says, wow, big black lettering.  They just stopped.  They're looking at this guy in complete awe.  It was hysterical.  It was really good.  Oh, that's great.  All right, guys.  Syndication now.  Well, thank you.  All right, bye.  All right, enough on that.  I know the wowing has occurred. 
[01:46:00]  That's very, very cool.  Because the first question I asked when I got back today was how many people got on live  TV with wow signs.  And Ben's like, no one.  Well, there's no real initiative because then they do it and no one talks about it on the  air.  So that's true.  Now they can.  All right, Dan.  Bring on the gimp.  Bring on the gimp.  The gimp.  Let me tell you something.  I am so glad I wasted four and a half hours of my life last night watching the Oscars 
[01:46:30]  for the simple fact that if I did not waste the four and a half hours, I would have never  saw the gimp.  You would have missed the gimp.  The gimp, probably the greatest moment in Academy Award history.  Forget about the streaker.  The streaker.  Even greater than the streaker.  Better than that.  Better than Marlon Brando not accepting the award and having the Indian woman come up and  accept it for him.  Better than you like me, you really like me.  The Sally Field asswipe move. 
[01:47:00]  Uh-huh.  Better than Benini last year saying he wanted to have sex with the whole audience on Mars  or whatever it was.  Benini wanting me to change my last name so I sound like either Jewish or Irish or anything  but Italian because this monkey comes out there, look at me, I'm an Indian, I'm an Italian  retard, look at me, laugh at me, I'm a stupid guindaloon.  I can't stand that guy.  See how old that got?  Oh my God.  Last year, I mean.  What was he doing there this year? 
[01:47:30]  Well, I did not know.  I brought up my ticket stuff from last year.  I got back to the canteen.  I said, hello, look, I'm Benini.  And they let me in.  Well, because he won Best Actor, he gets to present.  Oh, that was it.  So he presents.  Yes.  But it's funny because, I mean, in general, last year Benini did his whole song and dance  and for the most part, people thought it was kind of...  Oh, the lovable, stupid wop.  Right.  Fast forward a year and you want to strangle him.  Oh, enough of him.  But the gimp was a greater moment than Benini's... 
[01:48:00]  Greater than that.  Greatest moment in Academy Award history.  What was it?  The 72nd annual.  72 years of the Academy Award.  And it took until the year 2000 to come up with the single greatest moment in Academy Award.  The award history, The Gimp.  Now, I hope everyone knows what we're talking about at this point.  They were giving out the award for what?  Best Documentary or Short Form Documentary, Long Form Short Documentary. 
[01:48:30]  Whatever.  It was one of the...  It was Documentary Short Subject.  Short Subject.  Okay.  Thank you.  And the winner, the film King Gimp.  It was about this guy who I don't know what's wrong with him.  He looks like perhaps...  I'm going to assume it's Cerebral Palsy.  CP could be, right?  I think it was CP.  And at one point in the clip in the film, they showed him with this little apparatus on his head.  The little thing on his head with a stick sticking out. 
[01:49:00]  Right.  Of the front of it.  So he could communicate with people.  And he would, like, knock blocks around with this stick on his head.  And this won an Academy Award.  Where do you get to see this movie, first of all?  I want to see King Gimp.  I want to see King Gimp.  I need the full feature King Gimp.  So, you know, they go through all the nominees.  They had those two little sex monkeys from...  American Beauty?  American Beauty, yes.  Yeah.  Up there with the guy from American Beauty. 
[01:49:30]  And they announce...  And the winner...  The Oscar goes to King Gimp.  At which point, the crowd just goes wild.  And the director...  And the producer, I guess, I don't know.  Who obviously don't rate.  They're in the back row of the theater.  Yeah, way in the back.  Start trying to make... 
[01:50:00]  They stand up.  Because they're so surprised that King Gimp wins.  Yeah.  Now, the subject of the film, the said Gimp, is sitting in his wheelchair.  Now, call me stupid.  But I thought the actor that portrayed King Gimp in the movie was acting.  No, see, it's a documentary.  But I guess if it's a documentary, it means that he wasn't acting.  And that's how it really is in real life.  Absolutely.  Okay.  So he's sitting in his wheelchair.  And he's kind of, you know, spasming a bit. 
[01:50:30]  And they announce that King Gimp, indeed, is the winner.  Yeah.  The two people responsible for the film stand up.  Mm-hmm.  At which point, King Gimp, in the chair, just freaks the F out.  He's flailing around.  Like a fish out of water.  He's so excited that his film won, that his arms are flapping, he's smacking the people  that are trying to help him.  Like the guy that made the film, there's a guy and a woman that is supposed to, they're  supposed to be making their way onto the stage to accept this award. 
[01:51:00]  They're spending time, they can't walk away.  Because King Gimp, he looks like a flounder you just brought up on the deck of your boat.  He's flapping.  His arms are smacking the guy in the head.  And the guy's got one hand on King Gimp's chest, trying to hold him in the wheelchair.  Yeah.  Doesn't work.  No.  King Gimp spasms his way.  He slips and slithers out of the chair.  Oh, but he's on the floor.  He's flapping on the, the wheelchair rolls away at this point. 
[01:51:30]  It rolls backwards.  At this point, I have to confess, the spaghetti that was in my mouth hit the TV.  Dude, I'm doing my best King Gimp impression.  Because I'm on the floor laughing so hard I'm convulsing.  Now, the people that are running the Academy Awards are in a major quandary at this point.  What do you do?  What do you do?  You know you have the special interest groups watching the Academy Awards.  You've got to show the people that are working their way up to accept the award.  But they've got to take care of King Gimp, who just fell out of his chair. 
[01:52:00]  So they kept the camera on King Gimp and the two people for a while.  Long enough to see him flapping on the floor.  Three aborted attempts to get him in the chair.  Three times they lifted him up and he's just,  Like freaking.  You know they want to cut away.  But if they cut away, you know, the hell that, right, that they would have to go through.  So they go to an audience shot.  A quick audience shot.  Then they go to a quick shot of the three kids from American Beauty again. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  Then back to King Gimp, who somehow, I guess when the camera was off,  they just gaffed him with a hook or something.  Because they miraculously got him back in his chair at that point.  They must have like,  Oh, all right, they move the camera.  Get up in your captain chair!  Just smack King Gimp back in his chair.  No.  The single greatest moment.  Let me tell you something.  And the fine people that made King Gimp missed a great opportunity. 
[01:53:00]  Right.  They should have wheeled King Gimp up to the podium there.  Dude, I was hoping.  Because, first of all, he would have got a standing ovation.  Second of all,  Second of all,  the one billion people that were watching the telecast last night  would want to go see the movie at that point.  Yes, I at that point wanted to see the movie King Gimp.  They didn't even acknowledge his existence when they were doing their acceptance speech. 
[01:53:30]  No.  They just said, you know, thank you to him or something real quick.  They didn't put the camera back on him or anything.  And what's more disappointing is Billy Crystal.  Why didn't he comment about the Gimp?  Oh, no.  When other goofy things happen during the awards,  he's got a quick, witty little line.  What happened to the quick, witty line about King Gimp?  Flailing around, you know, in the back of the auditorium.  He was flopping around on that floor.  He was so excited. 
[01:54:00]  Just flopping around on the floor of the Academy Awards.  King Gimp, the greatest moment in Academy Award history.  Let's go, Eric.  What's up?  Oh, my God.  I never laughed so hard in my life.  I was dying.  I was hoping the guy was going to get up to help set the awards.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was hoping they were going to wheel him up.  He didn't know how to get him up.  It was so funny.  He was on the floor, and they couldn't even pick him up  because he was flailing so crazy they couldn't get a hold of him. 
[01:54:30]  No, it sucked for those people.  They're filmmakers.  They've been waiting their whole life for an Oscar.  They finally get their names called, and they can't go to the stage  because they'll look like idiots if they don't help the Gimp.  Oh, my wife just told me a bastard for laughing.  I'm telling you.  And that lady's hair.  What was up with that?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Oh, my God.  She looked like she was flopping around with him before the show.  Yeah.  Oh, what a man.  Well, I was hoping so bad they were going to try to wheel him up.  I was hoping, too.  So they'd wheel him up on stage, and maybe he'd do the flop on stage.  Let me tell you something. 
[01:55:00]  That was the only thing I saw on the whole Academy Awards.  I turned that on.  I had to turn it off because I just had to leave it like that.  It was so good.  Because you knew at that point it was never going to get better than King Gimp.  But I'm telling you something.  If you don't laugh at that, then you just don't have a sense of humor.  Oh, my God.  Better bring up the Gimp.  The Gimp's flopping around on the floor.  I can think about him in a locker outfit, man.  All right.  Turn me on.  Thank you, Arch.  All right.  Take care.  Pick him up, then.  Let's go to Peter.  Peter, you're next on N.E.W.  That was a king freaking Gimp, man. 
[01:55:30]  King Gimp, right?  I thought it was a joke.  I thought he was trying to do a Benini thing with a top-back guy from last year.  He looked like the fish at the end of the Faint No More video.  Oh, my God.  It was so embarrassing, man.  It was so awful.  And you could see the guy that was responsible for the film had to hold the Gimp.  He was trying to hold him with one hand on his chest, trying to hold him in the wheelchair.  But he's looking up at the stage like, the music's playing.  I've got to get up on stage. 
[01:56:00]  At which point, the Gimp is just freaking out so much, he slid from between his hand and the wheelchair.  Next day, they're going to have to have one of those ramps up to the stage, you know?  Hey, Peter, we brought the tape in.  We have officially seen it 12 times.  We kept rewinding it and playing it over.  We were laughing our asses off in the office.  We watched it 12 times.  That has to be on the unofficial O.P. Anthony website.  Yeah, get the Gimp on there.  Get the Gimp on the unofficial website.  Welcome back, gentlemen.  Thank you, Peter.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Hey, here's the guy that saw the King Gimp movie.  Chris, what's up? 
[01:56:30]  Hey, guys, what's up?  Hey.  Oh, man, I couldn't even contain myself last night when I saw that thing.  I was in the house with like five guys.  Dude, I was laughing so hard, I started farting.  I mean, you know what gets that point?  You just, like, lose it.  I saw the movie at Cinema Arts in Huntington.  Oh, yeah.  Is it still playing there?  No, it was there like a month and a half ago.  It was like a collection of short films.  Cinema Arts.  That was always a place to go in Huntington where you could see, like, naked chicks in  some French movie.  Yeah, artsy movies.  It was like the artsy-fartsy movie theater. 
[01:57:00]  Anyway, in the movie, man, they actually had the guy going down the street in his chair,  man, freaking out.  And then, like, stopping.  And, like, I felt like I was watching National Geographic Explorer where they don't help the  little pup that's about to be killed by the cheetah.  You know, like, I wanted the guy to go and help him, like, get into the house or something.  But they just wouldn't do it, you know?  Help the gimp.  Yeah.  And I wanted to flop up onto the stage like a fish on the docks.  Yeah, I know.  I was so hoping they would wheel him up on stage.  But with that strap, that thing that's strapped to his head, he creates artwork with that, 
[01:57:30]  man.  It's like a brush and a pencil.  Oh, is that what that was?  Oh, man, you should see the stuff he makes, dude.  You think that flopping on the floor was crazy?  You should see what he paints.  Chris?  Is it, like, insane?  It's totally nuts, man.  It's like, you know those guys that just throw paint on the canvas?  Yeah.  I don't know what kind of fluids, like spit and, like, jizz and whatever else is on there,  man.  I don't know.  He had some crazy stuff going on in that.  That was the whole point of the movie was to show how this guy makes great art.  Yeah, he discovered art, Anthony.  Yes.  Amazing. 
[01:58:00]  All right.  Anyway, welcome back, guys.  Thank you, Chris.  All right.  Bye.  They should just paint and put his body, dip it in paint and tell him he won the Oscar and  put a canvas on the floor.  That'd be some artwork, man.  Dennis, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Did you see when he was all calmed down and they had him all strapped in with all the  arms and his face was still going up and his, like, tongue was, like, basically kicking  his nose?  Yeah, he was, like, strapped into his chair.  It looked like he was, like, rabbit or something like that.  He was, like, coming at the mouth and stuff.  That was so insane, man. 
[01:58:30]  That was actually the only part I saw of the Emmy.  I was watching it.  I was flipping through.  I was watching Sopranos and I came all the way back to, you know, Channel 7 or whatever  it was.  Well, yeah.  And all of a sudden I saw this guy flopping his hands all over the place.  I was like, what the hell's the matter with this guy?  You had perfect time.  My girlfriend was, like, smacking me and said, she's like, that's not mine.  That's not funny.  Come on, ladies.  You didn't laugh at that.  You have to laugh.  What else are you going to do?  I don't know.  I couldn't hold it.  You know, I was just cracking up.  She's smacking me. 
[01:59:00]  Like, you know, I want a viewer like that.  I was like, no, I don't want to get any Emmys.  All right, Dennis, I've got to cut you off.  Your phone's starting to break up, but thank you.  All right, masturbation now.  All right, man.  He thought I was watching the Emmys, Opie.  Yeah, they should have had the Gimp perform Blame Canada.  Got to thank Donna from Jersey.  I need some feedback for that.  Sally, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  I just had to say, you're going to think of me retarded because I didn't even know  who this guy was.  I had no idea what he was about.  And so when I saw him on the floor, I thought he was just excited.  Yeah.  So I was just like, okay. 
[01:59:30]  I was like, ha, ha, and then I found out and I realized that he was just a little  slow.  Yeah.  And I'm like, what's wrong with these people?  They're not helping him.  Yeah.  Help him.  Yeah.  I mean, they're sitting there laughing and pointing and I'm like, okay.  You know, and I'm sitting there, I'm like, and I was laughing and I'm like, why are  these people pointing lands and pick them up?  I didn't want it to, no, I didn't want it to end.  No, I didn't want it to end.  You know, when you're watching it, like I'm watching it and as it's happening, I'm  saying to myself, oh, my God, I can't believe I'm watching this.  This is the Oscars.  But I'm like, I hope it keeps going.  And I hope like he rolls all the way under someone's chair and they can't get to him 
[02:00:00]  and the rest of the show, they're trying to coax the gimp out from underneath Gwyneth  Paltrow or something, you know?  That's what I want.  I didn't want it to end.  It was great.  Great moment.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  That's funny, man.  Let's go to Beth real fast.  Beth, what's up?  Not much.  What's up with you guys?  Talking about the gimp.  Yeah.  No, I was watching it last night with my husband.  Yeah.  My God, we thought the man was like having a heart attack or an epileptic  steezer or something where like we not really pay much attention to the clips when they 
[02:00:30]  were showing it.  And when they said it won, we're like, oh, how nice, you know, the documentary one.  And then they flashed to this guy.  I'm like, oh, my God, is he dying or something like that?  He's like all over the floor.  He's very excited.  Oh, it was, yeah, yeah.  And then we're like, well, maybe he's just happy.  Like, ooh, there's something very wrong here.  This is not the way it's supposed to go.  No.  But it was weird.  Not exactly what you expect to see on the Academy Awards.  That's weird.  No.  That's why when it happened, it was like, wow, is this the Academy Awards?  Yeah, right?  All right, Beth, thank you.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye-bye. 
[02:01:00]  All right, and we've got to take a quick break.  A lot of other people standing by to talk about the Oscars.  Also, yeah, well, we'll get into this.  Perry from Queens writes on the instant feedback, I would like to know if I am the only one who  noticed that Angelina Jolie and her brothers seem like they're banging.  Yeah, a lot of people are saying that.  We'll get into that next, okay?  Stay there.  Obi and Anthony.  Oh, those guys are back!  One, two, seven, WNEW.  What?

The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Okay, Anthony.  Yes?  We are back.  We're talking about the Oscars a little bit.  Yeah.  A couple interesting things happened last night. 
[02:03:30]  A couple more calls on the GIMP, and then we'll move on to the other things.  Who do we have on the show?  Hello?  Yeah, it's you, man.  What's your name?  Oh, sorry.  Houston.  Houston?  Yeah, it's a nickname.  All right.  What's up?  Oh, nothing.  I just want to say, when the King GIMP guys got up there to accept their award, like in  the background, tell me you hear, you know, this big, giant, you know, thrown out there,  like, you know, in the middle of their ceremony.  Yeah, he was screaming in the background.  I know.  I was laughing my head off, you know?  It was pretty funny.  Without a doubt. 
[02:04:00]  All right.  Syndication, whenever, guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Billy checking in.  Billy, what's up?  Oh, my God.  Oh, Billy from Air Sick.  How are you, bro?  Hey, man.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  Welcome back, buddy.  Thank you.  Listen, I saw that thing with King GIMP, right?  Yeah.  I'm watching it, and I'm dying, and I'm looking like, I have to be the only one seeing this.  Right.  Yeah.  I pick up the phone.  I start calling people.  It's like, you know, aliens are taking over my TV.  The funniest thing was, they're, like, helping the guy.  Then they go, GIMP, I'm going for the Oscar. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah, yeah.  After a while, because the music's playing.  They know they have a limited time, or else they're going to just say, and the next award,  you know, and cut them off.  This is their moment to shine.  So they just dumped the GIMP, and worked their way up to the stage.  That was it.  They dumped the GIMP.  That was, it's exactly what they did, because they cut away to the audience, and then to  the presenters for, like, three seconds, and then all of a sudden, what, the GIMP is up  in his chair?  I know.  I think the guy pulled him up by the hair, said, this is my moment, you GIMPy bastard.  Get in the chair and shut up. 
[02:05:00]  The security guys came over, and then they showed the trash collector guy.  Yeah.  And they go, look at that.  We got better seats than the GIMP.  Oh, God.  Well, that whole mess was funny.  That guy looked like he just won the lottery, didn't he?  Oh, my God.  He looked like the famous lottery winner from New York.  Yeah.  Ended up putting the top hat on his head.  Curtis Sharp.  Curtis Sharp, right.  I won $5 million.  The worst part is, I'm sitting there going, I wasted all this money on acting lessons,  and all I have to do is flop around the floor like a retard.  And you win an Oscar.  Yeah. 
[02:05:30]  That's an Academy Award winning GIMP.  Jesus.  I will never forget the GIMP.  That was it.  I mean, I could have died right then and there, and I'm sitting there going, I've got to talk  to somebody about this.  You know, this is, and this proves that the Oscars are a bunch of crap and stuff, because  I'll tell you something.  That had to be the one moment that everyone's talking about today, as far as the Oscars go.  It was probably the most standout, memorable moment in Oscar history.  Next year, when they do a little retrospective on this year's Oscars, do you think the GIMP is  going to show up flying on the ground? 
[02:06:00]  Hell no.  You don't know, with news clips, when they showed, you know, who won the Oscars.  Did Channel 4 News, Channel 2 News, Channel 7 show the GIMP flopping on the floor?  No.  What about Billy Crystal?  He didn't have one thing to say?  No.  He had a lot to say about Isaac Hayes, but nothing about the GIMP.  Yeah.  That shut Billy Crystal right up.  He should have said something.  It just, it just, it totally amazed me.  It's like, if you did not see that or did not tape it, you would never see it again.  No.  Never.  No, they're not going to show that.  No.  We're going to try to get it on the unofficial website. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, we've got to get that everywhere.  It's priceless.  I'm trying to find a song that rhymes with GIMP.  Yeah.  Could be a most offensive song.  What the hell rhymes with GIMP, for God's sake?  I'm going to go to my list here.  It's like, oh, almighty.  Billy, let me tell you, you and Paul better get back to work, because Killer Fetus is lagging  in the competition now.  Oh.  Yeah.  We're biding our time.  Oh.  Okay.  Okay.  We've, we've thought about, we've devised the master plan.  We are picking our spot.  All right.  We've seen what the competition is going for and waiting for our opening. 
[02:07:00]  All right.  Just like the GIMP.  I was getting nervous.  I'm like, I know these guys have one more song in them somewhere.  Oh.  Oh.  The question is not just one, it's which one.  Okay, good.  We're seeing which topics get beat to death, and then we're going to move in.  All right.  Good, Billy.  Guys, listen, well, I'm glad to have you back.  Hey, thank you.  Bye, guys.  Bye.  All right, well, we've talked about the GIMP.  Yeah.  We have to get to Perry from Queens' instant feedback.  Once again, he writes, I would like to know if I am the only one who noticed that Angelina 
[02:07:30]  Jolie and her brother seem like they're banging.  And the post has an interesting little clip on this.  It says, just asking, which actress who is a very prudent figure at last night's Oscars  prefers to roll her own?  The Sultry Star is said to be carrying on an incestuous affair with her own brother.  Who can be forgiven for being unable to resist the temptation?  I don't know.  Now, Anthony has a theory on this.  Well, let's go to the phones first, all right? 
[02:08:00]  All right, see if anybody else comes with my theory.  There is a guy that has your theory on this whole thing.  But basically, Angelina Jolie's been showing up at all these award shows with her brother,  and I thought they were lovers before I found out that, you know, that's her brother.  Yeah.  And I'm convinced there's something going on there.  Yeah, there's something going on, all right.  Anthony's not.  No.  Let's start with Pete.  Hey, Pete, what's going on?  Oh, and hey.  How are you, bro?  What's up, fellas? 
[02:08:30]  Welcome back.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, man, I'm telling you, there's definitely something going on there.  You think?  Same thing happened at the Golden Globes, man.  She was all over him in the crowd.  Yeah, I thought she was all over him because she was, like, you know, on drugs or something.  That's what I thought, too, when I saw the Golden Globes.  I thought, you know, this was her boyfriend or whatever.  Yeah.  And then when they showed her again, all right, I said, man, she's all over this guy.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  And the same thing with the Golden Globes.  She got up there and just.  And she was confessing her love to her brother last night in a way. 
[02:09:00]  I mean, I have a sister and I love her.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm all over her.  But I would never, like, express it in the way she was last night.  I know, man.  I'm all for, you know, families being close.  But that's a little too close.  You know what I'm saying?  So you're convinced that they're banging.  No doubt.  Except, you know, the one thing that makes me think that maybe they're not, the guy looks like a fag.  Well, that's.  Yes, absolutely. 
[02:09:30]  Now we can get into Anthony's theory, Pete.  I would love to hear Anthony's theory.  That's right.  Anthony, your theory on the whole Angelina Jolie thing.  Oh, I'm thinking, you know, that brother of hers probably, you know, got a bit of the gay in him.  I'm thinking, you know, from the looks of him, he's gay.  Absolutely.  I'm thinking, yeah.  All right.  So how. 
[02:10:00]  He's at least going both ways.  He's a gay guy and maybe has had some emotional crises and the sister, very loving, coming to the defense of her gay brother.  That's what I'm saying.  I'm thinking, brother, gay, that's it.  There's rumors about her, too.  Why?  That she's, you know.  Well, that's okay.  A vegetarian, let's say.  Oh, yeah?  Well, maybe she puts the old strap-on on and works the bro out.  Laurie, what's up? 
[02:10:30]  I don't know.  I smell a most offensive song.  Yeah.  What's up, Laurie?  Last night, which came up to get her award, she thanked her brother.  Yeah.  My mother was like, yeah, she was kissing that guy before the show.  Yeah.  And they were, like, all over each other.  They hold hands and hug and.  There's something not right there.  Yeah, but you look at him, I think you can tell, you know.  Yeah, he does look a little limp.  Gay.  All right, Laurie, thank you.  I think he has a bit of the gay.  Let's go to Jason.  Jason, you agree with Anthony's theory, right? 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, I do.  I'm upset you guys cut me off.  Yeah.  The guy came on and he said he was probably gay.  I told the guy on the phone that I think he's definitely gay because they come on and she  leans over to kiss him and there he is with his short, bleach blonde hair.  Yeah.  Four earrings.  His six rings.  You know, if I wanted to stereotype a gay guy, I would say that would be the look you  would go for.  Well, that's true.  But then she gets up and she tells him how he's the strongest and most brave guy she knows.  Yeah.  Now, what does that mean?  There's something.  That means he just came out of the closet. 
[02:11:30]  Right.  And people are bashing on him.  Mmm.  Look at you, Jason.  Got a theory.  I'm still kidding.  You got to be strong and brave to be gay.  Is that it?  Last night.  And I told them all that.  They're like, no, no, they're having sex.  And I said, no way.  Nah.  That guy is, he's, her parents, I bet.  I bet you the Voight's over there.  They had a little problem with it.  Yeah.  So she's the overprotective sister.  Let me look at her.  Her father's John Voight.  You know, he's got to keep the public image.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  The whole thing.  All right.  Good job.  You guys also noticed that Russell Crowe, during everything, never once, crack a smile. 
[02:12:00]  No, that guy's scary, huh?  When Billy Crystal makes the crack about the cigarette, he puts his fingers out.  Yeah, from the insider.  After Blame Canada, he sort of looked like he was going to crack a smile, but not quite.  I've got to give Robin Williams a little credit there.  Not the biggest Robin Williams fan, but I thought he did a pretty good job with that  Blame Canada song.  Blame Canada.  No, no, no, no.  That should have won, man.  I should have won.  Jesus Christ, come on.  It's a goop.  It was so obvious that it wasn't going to win. 
[02:12:30]  Well, everyone knew it wasn't going to win.  A little joke.  Thank you, Jason.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Good song and all, but no.  Phil Collins taking the Oscar for the Tarzan.  All right.  Anyone else look at Phil Collins' little thing he has up top and come to the realization  that it's time to give up on that thing?  It's time to shave your head completely.  I mean, what's he doing?  Yeah, back in the 80s and stuff, he had like the bald head thing going, but he had that strip  of hair.  He had enough where it kind of made a little sense up there, but now he's just holding 
[02:13:00]  on to dear life, to that little, I don't even know what you call it.  It's a little strip.  We got to play what's on Phil Collins' head with the phone.  Have him call in while I'm scraping across his head.  It would sound like a one-finger mohawk.  It's like Quisp.  Have a Quisp, a little cereal martian.  That's what he looks like.  He's cool.  What's he doing there?  He's got that little racing stripe.  It's just time to give up on that thing up there, Mr. Collins.  Isn't that a shame, too, when you don't have any hair on your head and you've got to put 
[02:13:30]  those monitors in your ears?  It looks like you're wearing hearing aids.  It's cool when you've got hair over your ears so you don't really notice, but him and  Sinead, when Sinead was wearing them, it just looks like, you know, hello, can I hear  you?  Well, I will think they've won.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was going to say, is it just me or does it seem like during the pre-show, he had his  stand behind her and his arms around her and his side of the face?  Yeah, because he's a loving gay brother. 
[02:14:00]  No, because he's a frigging, he's banging her.  It's incest.  I don't think so.  Well, that's what the Post is, you know, thinking it's all about.  Hey, everyone wants to believe that, but, you know, you've got to tell you what he's  wearing.  Maybe you're both right.  Maybe you're both right.  Maybe he is gay.  All right, Tim.  Over and out, Diamond Dust and Wrangler.  Ugh.  Didn't miss that when we were on vacation.  Mike, what's up?  10-4.  Hey, Mikey.  Hey.  Mike's phone sucks.  Hey, speaking of gay, I wanted to bring in the clip, but I forgot it at home. 
[02:14:30]  What?  Did anyone else see Barbara Walters interviewing Ricky Martin last night?  No.  And Barbara Walters just flat out asked Ricky Martin if he was gay.  Are you gay?  Now, before we go any further, Ed and I have no freaking idea what his sexual orientation  is, okay?  No.  Because we do get in trouble every time we bring this up.  Ish.  But wouldn't you answer the question?  Yeah, it's easy.  Okay.  Let's make believe I'm Barbara Walters.  All right.  Hello, LP.  Yeah. 
[02:15:00]  You know, I would like to ask you, are you gay?  Now, you have the whole world watching, right?  You answered the question.  And what do you say if you're not gay?  I'm absolutely not gay, Barbara.  Oh, okay.  Next question.  Right.  But he had this long-winded answer that went nowhere.  I believe sexual orientation isn't really an issue where music is concerned and, you  know, I've been asked that a lot and I don't think it's really anyone's place to ask questions 
[02:15:30]  like that regardless of, what?  Answer the question.  Who cares?  If you're asked if you're gay, you answer the question if you're straight.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah.  If you're a straight guy, you go, oh, what?  You're gay?  No.  No, of course I'm not.  No.  If you're a gay guy, you say, well, you know, music, I don't really think.  I'm pissed I don't have the clip.  I forgot it at home.  Because I'm sitting there like, what?  You know, and you know his people got together with him and said, this is the best way to  answer this question. 
[02:16:00]  That was obvious.  Yeah, that way you don't sound like you're lying.  Well, what's the biggie if he is lying?  You know, if he comes out in the future and, yeah, he is gay, but, oh, he said he wasn't.  So?  You've got to wait for his record sales to drop.  Then he'll admit he's gay.  So then people will buy his albums again to hear what a gay guy sounds like.  Ricky Martin, behind the music.  Yeah.  But we have no clue what his sexual orientation is at.  Shake your butt tool, shake your big tool, shake your big tool.  We just thought it was a little weird that you wouldn't answer the question. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah.  I mean, there's a ton of straight guys.  There's a ton of gay guys that listen to our show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And let me talk to the straight guys.  If a guy, a guy, if a lady asks you if you're gay, what's your answer?  There you go.  Everyone just answered the question in their car.  Yeah.  They just flat out say no.  No.  No, but I'm willing to learn.  Liam from Baldwin.  I once saw Jay Moore and Jolie's brother in a yellow Miata, so maybe it is true. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  All right.  I mean, yeah, it's fine and all, but I wonder why they're speculating so much that they're  doing to each other.  Like, there's so many other things it could be than that.  She's just too touchy-feely with her brother, Ant.  You ever seen family like that?  You have a sister?  Yeah.  I have a couple sisters.  When we get drunk, I'll throw her a banging.  Yeah.  I mean, what's the bit?  If I touch my sister by accident, you know, she's screaming cooties and all that. 
[02:17:30]  There are some families that are very touchy-feely, and especially like that, if you look at that  situation where the brother's a gay, and she's this Oscar-winning actress now, she seems  very protective of her gay brother.  That's how I see it.  Who knows?  Maybe she's hobbing his knob.  I don't know.  But it doesn't, that wouldn't be my first thing, I would think.  You know, do you grab your sister's head when you're kissing her?  Tongue kissing? 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  Yes, I grab it, and then I pull her ears down to my groin area.  Yes.  No.  What do you mean grab her head?  That's what Jolie did.  She grabbed the back of his head as she was kissing him on the side of the head, and it  was just all...  Probably all drunk and stupid.  It was just weird.  Absolutely weird.  Let's go to Big Kev.  Big Kev, what's up?  Oh, hey, what's up?  Hey.  I see that they fixed line three.  Oh, I was hoping that way.  I forgot how annoying that is.  Hey, what do you got, Kev? 
[02:18:30]  Hey, first of all, Anthony, you better stop busting on Ricky Martin, or you're not going  to be able to get those tickets when he comes around.  Shut up, you dick.  I want Ricky Martin tickets.  Hey, Kev, before you continue, I've got to read this.  Perry from Queens.  Tonight on VH1's Behind the Music, Ricky Martin, getting behind the behind.  The real behind the music.  Very good.  Hey, Angelina Jolie's brother, maybe she's, you know, very close to him all of a sudden  because maybe he's, I don't know, not quite FBA. 
[02:19:00]  Ah.  Ah.  Well, you never know.  So you had a comment about Robin Williams and Blame Canada?  Yeah.  What was with the giant, gigantic postman guy, dancer?  Did you see that guy?  They had a whole bunch of the dancers come out, and they're supposed to represent, like,  I guess, the townspeople?  Yeah.  And they had an absolutely huge, I'm a big guy, but that guy was absolutely huge and dancing,  wearing the postman outfit.  Yeah, I missed that, I guess. 
[02:19:30]  You should check your tape on that because that was unbelievable.  Well, if we review the tape again, we can never get past King Gimp.  I mean, there's no other part we could get to because if the tape's in there and we're  watching it, we're watching King Gimp 800 times.  That was unbelievable.  Yeah.  All right.  Thanks, Kevin.  Take care.  Bye.  And then Warren Beatty's acceptance speech was just babbling.  I have no clue what he said.  No freaking idea.  Same thing with the Spanish guy that came out. 
[02:20:00]  Antonio Banderas introduced this guy.  You know, he was getting his award, he comes up and starts babbling.  And he pulls out this piece of paper and starts talking about something with his sister  and the reasons that you win the Oscar.  And they weren't cutting him off.  I'm sitting there watching going, come on.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.  You know, play the music.  Cut this guy off.  Yeah.  They weren't cutting him off.  Finally, Antonio Banderas, like, grabbed his arm and started dragging him off the stage.  It was a mess.  And finally, as we wrap up our Oscar discussion. 
[02:20:30]  Yes.  Very important Oscar discussion.  Did anyone else catch the fact that Jane Fonda was giving out some foreign movie award?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Bitch.  Hanoi Jane.  Hanoi Jane.  What was it?  A Vietnamese movie?  Who knows?  Had a friggin' shoot at bombers from your rice paddies?  I got in trouble at my place because I was screaming.  What?  Communist at the TV.  And who was debating that?  Oh, let's see. 
[02:21:00]  My brother.  Oh, you're with people.  I was like, are you in a real liberal family there?  I'm like, do you realize what this lady did during the Vietnam War?  Pictures of her on anti-aircraft guns.  Great.  Thank you.  With the Viet Cong.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Now she's giving out a foreign film award.  I thought that was pretty funny.  Great.  Pretty funny.  Hanoi Jane.  Go over there.  Let's see how they would work your plastic surgery over there in Ho Chi Minh City. 
[02:21:30]  Let's see what your facelift would look like after that.  Oh, we just got to make a little trim here.  Rook, we're you and I'll have around die no more.  Speaking of plastic surgery, Cher gets one more, man.  She's got that goatee.  A goatee.  Oh.  All of a sudden, her face looks different now.  Remember when she was the long-faced, puffy-lipped Cher?  Mm-hmm.  When she was kind of doing those infomercials that she was getting a lot of flack for?  Now, she doesn't have the big puffy lips anymore, and her face isn't as pulled back as it is up now.  Up and back. 
[02:22:00]  Cher.  She ought to do something with that ass, though, now.  You know?  She's apologizing for dressing like an adult, she said.  Yeah.  Because she's not wearing one of those Mackie friggin' cover the nipples and the gas dress.  Because she might have enough sense to know she can't get away with that anymore.  Those big tats on her ass, remember those?  Oh.  When she, if I could turn back time, if I could find a way.  And she had her ass there.  Big tats on her ass.  You know what those must look like now?  My father had a couple on his forearms. 
[02:22:30]  From, like, Korea.  You couldn't even tell what planet they were from.  We could all relate.  Remember playing Silly Putty with the Silly Putty as a kid?  Yeah.  You'd get the nice little, you know, different colors.  Comic strip on your little Silly Putty and then you would stretch it?  What does it look like?  It looks like.  You can't tell.  It's all just blue mess.  Right.  Looks like she sat in a puddle of blue ink in a gravel driveway.  That's what her saggy-ass tattoo looks like now. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  So she was all covered up.  But, of course.  I mean, what is she going to do?  Dress like she did 20 years ago?  Cover that up.  Just work on the face now.  That's what she's doing.  She's defaulted all the construction to her face.  Took the scaffolding away from the body.  Just cover it up now.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  They're showing me a picture of Matt and Trey in their dresses.  That was pretty funny.  That is pretty good.  Got to get props.  Ballsy moves.  Very ballsy move.  They'll never be invited back for the Oscars.  What are they going to?  Oh, my God. 
[02:23:30]  Look at that.  We got nominated again?  And I think it doesn't happen.  Who cares, you know?  They're all just so full of themselves.  The goof nominee.  All right, and we've got to take a break.  All right.  We're giving out tickets to opening day with the Mets.  Where's my little winner sheet there?  I've got to give that sponsor a plug.  We had a great idea.  Yeah.  We got 100 tickets to go see opening day with the Mets.  You and I were supposed to go.  Yeah.  And then it turned out that we're going to be in L.A. 
[02:24:00]  Next Monday, we're going to be flying back from L.A.  We're going out to WrestleMania.  Yeah.  I want to thank the fine folks at WWF for giving us a trip out to WrestleMania.  Thank you.  But because we're doing that, we can't go to the game with 100 of our faithful listeners like we planned.  No.  So now we're sending Psycho Mark.  Now, the deal with these tickets, it's not easy to get 100 tickets together opening day at Shea Stadium.  So I want you guys to understand where these seats might be. 
[02:24:30]  You're still going to have a great time.  Yeah.  But not directly behind home plate is what I'm getting at.  No.  It's always cool, though, counting the rivets on the L-1011s that fly over your head.  It's pretty cool.  One, two, three.  Oh, look at it go.  But we meant, well, it's still going to be a good time.  It's going to be 100 of the faithful listeners with Psycho Mark, Wow Science, Screaming and Yelling.  It's just going to be a great time.  But we just want to warn you ahead of time because we take pride in the stuff we give away on our show.  Yes.  And we don't want you to think, oh, my God, I'm going to be sitting right above the dugout, 
[02:25:00]  and it turns out you're in the section where couples have sex because no one can see that high.  I'm right over the dugout, but I'm in Yankee Stadium.  Right.  So with that said, it's still going to be a great time.  And they're not that bad.  No.  But they're not like.  In the stadium, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty close, yeah.  Yeah, sure.  All right, so we'll give two four-packs away right now, okay?  So you've got some friends that you can invite. 
[02:25:30]  That's cool, okay?  We'll take the 10th and 11th callers for a four-pack of tickets to the Mets opening day next Monday with Psycho Mark,  courtesy of smallworld.com.  Check out that website.  It's easy to play in and it's free.  It's a fantasy baseball website.  A lot of people into the fantasy baseball.  So if you're into that, check out smallworld.com, okay?  10th and 11th callers get them, 212-757-1027, and we'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  Who would you rather nail?  I disqualify myself because I've done them both. 
[02:26:00]  1027 WNEW.  Want to give more stuff away?  How many of these can we give away?  Five.  Five?  Yeah.  All right.  And I don't know if you're into the Fat Boy Slim.  Yeah?  I'm completely into the Fat Boy Slim myself.  Sure.  I like the Fat Boy Slim.  You do?  It's on every commercial on TV.  I know.  You don't know who Fat Boy Slim is.  They use it for every single commercial on TV shows, even movies. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  He's all the rage.  And he's got, what, a new mix CD coming out tomorrow, Ben?  Yeah.  All right.  And we got five of these?  All right.  No, it's a mix CD.  He's just mixing tunes?  Live.  Huh?  It's like if you were at a club hearing him DJ live.  Okay.  But, you know, some of his hits and stuff are on there.  All right.  So if you're into that type of thing, because it's a little different.  It's definitely different. 
[02:27:00]  Fat Boy Slim works when you're trying to work out, by the way.  Without a doubt.  You throw that on and you just go.  Yeah.  All right.  We got five of these.  The winner receives a copy of On the Floor at the Boutique.  Or the Boutique.  The Boutique.  The new mix CD by Fat Boy Slim.  Before you can buy it, it goes on sale, I believe, tomorrow.  What else comes out tomorrow?  Anything fun?  I think there's a Kiss Alive 4 or something coming out.  Kiss Alive 4.  Oh, wow.  Getting ready for another farewell tour.  Are they going to do the... 
[02:27:30]  You think the Kiss is going to do the Who thing?  Have like four or five farewell tours?  Haven't they already?  Jesus Christ.  I think they have.  They're coming around again?  What are they...  I saw somewhere.  Those guys are so good at marketing, man.  They're brilliant.  I saw somewhere.  I think Steve sent it to me from the unofficial site.  They were doing their first few songs live on VH1, and a girl totally flashed and went  right over VH1.  Nice.  It is completely about the cash with them, guys.  All right.  It has nothing to do with the music anymore. 
[02:28:00]  So if you want to check out the brand new Fat Boy Slim mix CD, we'll take the first five  callers right now.  212-757-1027.  We've got to start giving away more music on our show.  We've got to start giving away concert tickets on this damn radio show.  Yeah, that way we'll get some.  Are the record companies paying any attention to the O.P. and Anthony show?  No, they'll give tickets over to a show that's not getting any ratings.  We have double the ratings of K-Rock and Afternoon Drive.  Wake up, guys.  They'd rather, you know, go to a track that has rack blacks. 
[02:28:30]  Rack black.  This is a rock and roll talk show.  I'm talking to the record companies at this point.  Send your bands, send your CDs, send your concert tickets.  This is the place to promote your shows and your artists.  Don't be stupid.  I know it doesn't sound right because we're not playing a lot of music, but it makes sense.  Trust me.  What, K-Rock?  What?  What?  Oh, that's right.  Okay.  We can't have that band. 
[02:29:00]  No, they're slowly coming aboard.  Coming aboard.  I think starting tomorrow we're going to have tickets to see Filter.  Oh.  Filter rocks a lot.  Yes.  They're playing the Hammerstein Ballroom April 20th, and I believe we'll start giving away  those tickets tomorrow.  So they are coming aboard slowly but surely.  All right.  But to all the record companies, don't be scared.  You know, we want Godsmack in our studio.  We want these guys in the studio.  We'll let them plug in and jam for an hour.  We don't care.  I'm going to berate Sully if he ever sets foot in here. 
[02:29:30]  The guy should come to the table.  I don't care what record company execs, what radio station, or PDs, or anything say what.  He should get on the phone and call because we had a goddamn relationship up in Boston when  they were first starting out.  He should at least just, as a person, call.  I don't need the bulk Godsmack emails that I get.  Hey, from Sully, click, hello, Godsmack fan. 
[02:30:00]  It's like, Sully, it's me, you jack-off.  You gave me a videotape of some chick getting dumped on.  Godsmack playing OzFest.  Yeah.  The lineup this year is great.  It's Ozzy, Godsmack, Pantera, Static X, Methods of Mayhem.  How is Ozzy keeping up with these wacky kids these days?  Is this his last OzFest?  I've been hearing that he's saying that's a...  He says it every year.  This is my last OzFest.  I can't take any more.  I mean, this is just a whole thing of sex and drugs. 
[02:30:30]  Ozzy can't take it anymore.  I'm too effed up.  I'm too old for this.  What was it?  The behind the music with Motley Crue where Motley Crue is on tour with Ozzy and they  saw Ozzy snort up ants outside the tour bus?  Oh, the ants are going towards a popsicle stick all in a little line.  And I just thought it would be funny to lower his straw down and he's just snorting the  little buggers up.  And he did.  He did.  He snorted a line of ants. 
[02:31:00]  All right.  Who else is playing OzFest?  We said Static X, Methods of Mayhem.  That's Tommy Lee's new band.  Incubus.  Pod.  Incubus.  Monster Magnet.  We saw Monster Magnet a couple times.  They're really good.  And Ministry.  And speaking of Godsmack Ant.  Yeah.  We're going to be introing them.  What?  Don't worry, K-Rock.  It's not a New Yorker.  Oh.  So don't be all freaked out.  Ah, that's wicked cool.  Yeah.  Our buddy's up in Boston. 
[02:31:30]  We're slowly but surely getting syndicated back to Boston.  How come most people just get syndicated?  With us, it's like a covert operation into South America.  Right.  For hell.  I mean, come on.  You know what I mean?  The company, we continue to get great ratings month after month after month.  They syndicate you, but don't tell anybody you're being syndicated.  And we've got to do it real slow.  But they don't trust us.  They totally don't trust us.  It's like the F-up son that the father finally lets the kid have the keys to the car. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  And like, all right, but you can only be an hour and mom has to drive with you.  Like, it's a slow process of regaining the trust.  And they want us to be good for a certain amount of time.  We don't know what this certain amount of time is, because in between problems, we went  two weeks, and we were good.  Yeah, well, one hundred vacation.  And I thought that was good enough, because, you know, we're working it with this BCN.  We'll say it in Boston.  And I got one of the bigwigs on the phone up there. 
[02:32:30]  And I'm like, why aren't we syndicated?  And the guy's like, well, you haven't been good long enough.  I'm like, what do you mean?  We've stayed out of trouble for the last two weeks.  And he screams, two weeks, and just starts laughing.  I'm like, what?  You don't understand our track record.  Two weeks is a very long time.  Yeah.  Well, we had to be like that to get attention.  So we were on a crap-ass station that this N.E.W. used to be.  Did you say was?  Yeah, I know.  Well, you know why? 
[02:33:00]  Because now at least there's potential.  At least we have hope.  There's hope, right.  I mean, there was no hope back then.  Oh, there was none.  No.  So we were on this station where we could either go out like everyone else with no ratings,  no one listening, and everyone making excuses, or we could be the two biggest a-holes on the  radio and get attention, which got us in trouble a lot.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, well.  So the company doesn't trust us.  So we had this dilemma.  We're like, hmm, should we behave and be syndicated all over the place, or should we  continue doing the show we like to do and get in trouble? 
[02:33:30]  I think the truth of the matter is we don't have a choice because we only know how to do  the one thing.  I know.  I think you guys have figured it out because we just cannot stay out of trouble.  Oops.  Anthony, I want the station to throw us a bone.  Yeah.  I want NEW to be officially known as the Opie and Anthony Station.  But the NEW be the Opie and Anthony Station.  Station, yeah.  So like we are the flagship show.  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony Station.  If the copre is listening, starting immediately, we want NEW to be known as the Opie and Anthony 
[02:34:00]  Station.  The Opie and Anthony Station.  N-E-W.  Like that?  Yeah.  Interesting.  From the top of the Opie and Anthony building.  Yeah, can we use that one?  So, for now on, we're going to refer to NEW as the Opie and Anthony Station. 
[02:34:30]  From the basement of the Opie and Anthony Station.  Hey, we know it's ballsy and stuff.  Yeah.  Come on.  We put it in two years of hell.  Okay.  I think we deserve it.  I'm with you on this one.  Okay.  We'll take it up with the, uh, the ball for the thought task.  We want, like, uh, promos and sweepers to start immediately that just basically say,  WNEW, the Opie and Anthony Station.  The Opie and Anthony Station.  Yeah, I like it.  It's so pompous.  We're not pompous.  That's pretty funny, though.  We ought to do that. 
[02:35:00]  We do feel good because we moved into the big office.  Yeah.  Now we have the big office.  The biggest office.  Yeah, we're good.  And now we want to take it one step further.  We want the whole station.  We want the station to be known as the Opie and Anthony Station.  The Opie and Anthony Station.  All right.  I'm with you.  I like it.  Because now we're proud to be here at NEW.  Yes.  Oh, if you would have suggested this a year or so ago.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  We'll say the Opie and Anthony, you know, through two to seven.  Right.  That's us.  The Opie and Anthony hours.  Yeah. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  Well, we'll bring it up with the boss.  He'll probably laugh in our face.  You never know.  Great.  From the Opie and Anthony compound.  Compound.  All right.  Steve and Sick Boy checking in.  Sick Boy's still alive?  Wow.  I thought he fell off the face of the earth.  I thought he got pile driven through the ring.  From FoundryMusic.com, of course.  It's not a huge picture, guys, but I did get a shot of King Gimp on the unofficial Opie and Anthony website. 
[02:36:00]  It's in the files for section.  Oh, no.  We need the video clip.  Oh, no.  Steve, we need the video clip of him flapping on the floor.  We have a wheelchair.  We have it if you need it, Steve.  Of course, we're probably going to need a second copy because we'll wear it out when we get into the office after the show.  We've got to watch that another 12 or 13 times.  The Gimp falling on the floor is great.  All right.  And we've got to take a quick break.  Very quick break.  Okay.  It doesn't look too bad here behind me.  And you want to do a little Spaz radio? 
[02:36:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Spaz threw us a tape of some of the highlights of the week.  Yeah.  I guess he's going to have a feature every Friday.  Yeah.  Are you going to do this?  I think you and I have decided that Spaz needs a feature on the radio show for a while.  We did?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Just make it look like you care about the show.  Okay.  Good thing.  Keep making it look like we're busy trading to be in on some of these decisions.  What was that over here?  I can't hear you.  After hours. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, and you've still got to talk about Disney World.  I didn't trade.  I got to trade it.  And the trading.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break.  But, yeah, we're going to start a feature with Spaz called Spaz's Week in Review.  Spaz's Week in Review.  We need, like, some real old newsreel type music to open it up.  We're going to do it on Friday.  Spaz's Week in Review.  And have Spaz keep track of all the important stories of the week and give us a full report on Friday. 
[02:37:30]  But because we were away and we weren't around, you know, TV or newspapers.  Yeah.  Spaz collected a few news stories, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  And he put it together on a little tape for us.  Oh, great.  And I believe we'll have a little time to play that next, okay?  There's no better way to hear the news than with that special Spaz delivery.  That's right.  And we'll do that next.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony.  How often do you get to listen to somebody's cell phone through somebody's uterus? 
[02:38:00]  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  Uh, Anthony, we're in the middle of commercials, but we've got to go to Robert.  Uh, Robert has a good slogan for NEW.  Robert?  Yes, uh, 1027 WNEW, and Anthony lives.  Oh, I like that.  That's good.  That would make the old-timers roll over in their graves.  Oh, wait, they're not dead yet.  They just look that way.  Oh.  They will be soon.  Come on, a couple of them.  All right, Robert, thank you.  You got it.  Bye.  Anthony Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, you love it.  Let me tell you something.  I was down in the Caribbean on vacation, and I miss the fine food that Paisano delivers  on a daily basis, Anthony.  You know something?  When you've eaten Italian food at Paisano, you go anywhere else, oh, my God, you try to  get a good plate of pasta in Florida, oh, or driving back in North Carolina, this is  great, just like those New York Italians make.  Uh, no.  Uh, no, no.  When you've had the best, where else can you go? 
[02:39:00]  Yeah.  What do everything else is going to seem like crap?  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  The best.  Mm, huge portions, great atmosphere.  You go down there with the family or a date, you'll be proud to take them to Paisano, authentic  Italian cuisine, and it's made from the original Old World recipes.  Joey brought them over himself.  He swam with the Old World recipes in his shoes and, uh, opened up Paisano of Mulberry Street.  Uh, price is very reasonable.  Portions, like Ant said, huge.  The service is great.  Say hi to Pete. 
[02:39:30]  He's our favorite down there.  Pete.  He takes care of us.  And on the weekends, his name is Giovanni.  Really?  Is that what he says?  That's what he says, yeah.  Oh, okay.  And, uh, if you go there, just ask for Joey, the owner, you tell him, hey, Opie and Anthony  sent me, man, and he's going to give you a glass of wine on the house.  And make Pete say Opie.  It's the funniest damn thing.  What is it?  What does he do?  Pete.  He goes, uh, oh, it's very good to see you, uh, here.  Where's Hoppy?  Hoppy.  It's Hoppy.  Where's Hoppy? 
[02:40:00]  Who cares?  It's pretty funny.  It's a stupid name anyway.  Yeah, it's even stupider when he says it.  All right.  Paisano of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Give them a call if you want to make a reservation for the weekend.  965-1188.  Tell them Hoppy sent you.  That's 965-1188.  Paisano of Mulberry Street.  The clothes fall up.  You treat them like, you know, good people.  You don't talk down to them.  Hey, fuck you.  Jesus Christ.  Shut up.  You idiot.  You're such a loser.  Hey, fuck you.  What a retard. 
[02:40:30]  You're high.  Are you stupid?  Hey, fuck you.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  1027-WNEW.  Hey, when do the Mets play in Japan?  What?  Wednesday and Thursday.  We televised at 5 a.m.  Wednesday and Thursday.  What?  Wednesday and Thursday?  5 a.m.  They're opening the season over there?  Hey.  Why are we opening the season in Japan?  Hey.  Japan?  What the hell are we doing over there? 
[02:41:00]  Why are we so nice to them?  Why are we giving baseball and everything?  Come on.  They have a pretty good baseball league themselves, Anthony.  Oh, great.  And they send over the big fat pussy toad.  That's who we got.  Yeah.  Well, Ricky Henderson wants to be traded.  To Japan?  Who cares?  Just get rid of him.  The paper's saying he wants to trade and he'll ask no questions.  Just get rid of him.  Speaking of Japan.  Yeah.  And us on vacation.  News that happened when we were on vacation. 
[02:41:30]  Yeah.  You know who died?  Who?  Thomas Faraby.  Thomas Faraby.  Do you know who he is?  He invented the Furby?  No.  81 years old.  Any clues?  Has something to do with Japan?  Thomas Faraby?  Thomas?  Faraby.  A guy from Japan named Thomas?  He's not from Japan.  He has something to do with Japan.  I know who he is.  Who?  Wow.  Wow.  I know exactly who it is.  Ready?  Who?  He was retired in Florida, right? 
[02:42:00]  I don't know.  He dropped one of the bombs.  That's right.  Bombardier.  The Bombardier on the Enola Gay.  Thomas Faraby.  As the Enola Gay rolls out on the tarmac.  Her implement of destruction in her belly.  Bound for Japan.  That's right.  He was retired in Florida.  I believe, if I'm not mistaken, he was 81 years old.  81.  And, uh...  Dead.  Just living in a retirement home and no one...  I dropped a bomb!  No one has a clue. 
[02:42:30]  Isn't that great?  He's in a retirement home.  Hello.  And what did you used to do, Thomas?  I was a bombardier.  I killed the Japanese with the atomic bomb.  Now I'm on a little rascal.  He put a stop to World War II on his own, and no one down there walking is going to believe him.  He's just wheeling around on his little rascal.  Right.  All right, Colonel Tibbetts, I'm over the target.  Right.  I'll drop my coloscopy bag off my little rascal.  Now he's got bombs in his pants. 
[02:43:00]  Bomb and do the pilot coming around on his little rascal.  He was there in the belly of the beast, the B-29, ready to drop the bomb on the Japs.  And later on, let's fast forward, 81, there he is, crapping his pants on a little rascal.  Life just blows.  Time sucks.  Life blows.  Well, Godspeed, Thomas.  Godspeed to you.  Kathy Lee mentioned O&A on the air.  Yeah, sure.  I know it's a prank.  Might as well just go with it. 
[02:43:30]  Let's humor Sam.  Hey, Sam.  Yeah.  Hi, Kathy Lee mentioned us on the air.  Last Thursday.  Yeah, what'd she say?  No, it was like a one-liner.  She minimized you guys.  It was like whoever understood, understood.  Whoever didn't, didn't.  What was the line?  What was the line?  She said something about, wow, and, you know, these guys are lightweight.  Something like that.  Oh, okay.  I don't know.  Thanks, Sam.  Cool.  You're welcome.  Bye.  All right.  Let me see.  That was like 25 seconds of my life. 
[02:44:00]  I'm never, ever getting back.  Ever, ever, ever.  Well, Spaz is in the studio, Anthony.  Yes.  As we were hard at work vacationing,  Correspondent Spaz was on the job.  Yeah, so we had Spaz, uh,  Part of the only news team.  Yeah, keeping track of, uh, the news that we obviously missed while we were, you know,  drinking tequila and looking at babes and day trading and all the fun stuff you and I did separately on vacation.  Did you know who Thomas Farabee was, uh, Spaz?  Not a clue.  No.  Not a clue. 
[02:44:30]  Okay.  That's okay.  A lot of people don't know, I mean.  He's a, he's a war hero.  War hero.  Dropped the bomb.  Personally, uh, the Japs.  Stopped World War II.  Dropped the bomb.  Bomb.  Looking through the brand new, uh, Norden bomb site.  It was a wonderful, wonderful sight to see.  Hiroshima blowing up, flaming.  Burning Japanese.  I think we're burning Japanese.  I really think so.  So because we, uh, weren't close to newspapers or TVs for the most part, uh, Spaz, uh, decided to take it upon himself to, uh, give us some news stories, Anthony. 
[02:45:00]  So he went into the studio, uh, Saturday?  Saturday.  All right.  With, uh, a couple of newspapers, a bad attitude, and figured he'd just throw down the news like he would if he would, to, to open the mics here at NEW and just do news.  Like he was doing his own radio show.  Right.  So, um, we're about two minutes into his little tape here where he decides to start discussing some news events, Anthony.  A couple of news items.  Okay.  So are we ready?  Mm-hmm.  Any giant mosquitoes in these, uh, news things like last year?  He used to love that one. 
[02:45:30]  Like, no mosquitoes in the paper this time.  Not yet?  Okay.  Well, that'll be happening, I guess, in spring.  We'll have a giant mosquito update.  Did you see Spaz calling for headphones?  Yeah, that was kind of cool.  That was kind of cool.  I was impressed, like, where are my cans, you effing?  Right.  And Ben's, like, laughing as he brings them all over.  Shut up.  Get your own headphones, jerk off.  All right.  So, uh, so here's Spaz as he, uh, can I have some coffee?  Starts talking.  Help me.  Help me.  Get me some water.  Starts talking about the news.  Let's, let's go to the tape.  We're going to have to stop this a few times. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, I think you understand that, Spaz, okay?  All right, here he is.  Our buddy, our pal.  Spaz Radio, everyone.  Let's just get into a little bit of news, shall we?  What's happening around the world?  There's a lot of oddities that go on around the world, and, uh, this is, I think this  is the only radio station, the only show that's going to report them.  So, uh, let's just continue on, shall we?  Mm, what's going on?  Better tourism through nudity.  That's right.  Strip, and they will stay.  It's like the old Field of Dreams thing, like, if you build it, they will come, well, if they 
[02:46:30]  strip, they will stay.  Okay, terrific.  Italy's, uh, art galleries and magazines and televisions are full of it.  But on the beaches, nudity remains strictly off-limits, but not for long.  Because in, uh, Italy, they're going to allow beaches to become nude.  The beaches?  And what's the reason?  Wait a minute.  What are the people on the beaches?  Oh, the beaches are going to be allowed to be nude.  They're allowing the beaches to be nude?  That's good.  Yeah, they're, they're taking...  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! 
[02:47:00]  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah! Ah!  Of, of no nudity, and they're taking it off the beaches, so now the beach is going to  be nude.  Ah!  Ah!  Sopunk!  All right.  Nude beaches.  Nude beaches.  Nude beaches.  Okay.  Boost tourism, of course.  Anything to make a buck.  And, uh, I guess it took Italy a long time to understand that sex sells.  Sex brings money.  So, I guess, um, not only is Mexico a little behind the rest of the world, and maybe the Dominican 
[02:47:30]  republic but also yes world italy is behind the times a little bit too because they have finally  understood that sex sells well okay i have a couple of issues with that what what was the deal with  mexico the american republic i was just giving like a list of several countries around the world  who are a little behind the times just so i could so italy wouldn't stand so it wouldn't come out  italy's only behind the times other countries as well slow down okay okay okay okay mr push-up 
[02:48:00]  we're gonna see what kind of soldier you make all right that's good okay and then the um sex sells yes  how does that fit into nude beaches well because they made nude beaches to boost tourism which would  bring revenue to the country okay there's nude beaches right here you know in new york why would  you want to go to italy to to be nude i want to see the eiffel tower too oh in italy yeah in the pope 
[02:48:30]  in the vatican okay a little geography but boy you never disappoint man all right and in what uh great  city in italy is the eiffel tower i meant on the eiffel towers in france i'm sorry uh no i no italy has  the vatican very good okay i'm sorry and the leaning tower of 
[02:49:00]  every time i hear the phrase leaning tower i think pizza um i i don't know leaning tower um  don't know i see it was in the superman movie i know that and he's scraping it out yes yeah okay  that's good all right let's uh move on the beach segment opi uh in case you missed the news in there  uh italy is opening up his beaches as nude beaches thank you spaz next uh something we missed while 
[02:49:30]  we were on vacation we missed it on vacation but spaz our crack reporter or a reporter that's on crack  something like that was keeping tabs on the news ted from uh whitestone on the instant feedback please  play this back in english hence the new feature starting friday uh the weekend review with spaz yeah  okay let's move on with uh some more news stories here spaz please call me correspondent spaz are you  done with uh this i make one more comment one more time about the nude beaches in italy that that has 
[02:50:00]  the uh eiffel tower okay well good luck with that one i know what a boost towards them and i know  i'll be vacationing there in about dead well a couple years because i heard that the women over  there they're a little bit hairy so it's kind of frightening so i kind of want to like prolong it  maybe get drunk for a couple years then go to rome anyway uh which else is going around the world  oh do you realize italy has some of the most beautiful women in the entire universe 
[02:50:30]  but i hear it said that they're just like the french they're hairy and don't bathe that well  mama mia all right let's move on to the second story anthony  uh the review is already piling in dropped his cell phone wait wait wait what is this now hold on  it was no plus i don't want to know not a second i don't want to miss a second i'm just saying the  reviews are just piling in already on the phone well please wait on the phones we'll get to you 
[02:51:00]  all right let's go here uh and a guy dropped his cell phone in the zoo cage of a lion and do you know  what the dumb schmuck did that's right folks you get it you guessed it he actually went into the  cage went after the cell phone and then ran like a little bitch away from the line and got out of the  cage and the guy only got like minor scratches and bruises well why are you so angry with this man 
[02:51:30]  because he's a dumb schmuck i mean obviously why is he a dumb schmuck because if you drop a cell phone  in the lion's cage you don't try to get the phone you just but don't you think it was brave of the  guy to jump into the into the cage to try to get his cell phone back but you call him like he was  scared and ran away like a little bitch i'm trying to get to the point where now now okay i'll take i'll  i'll i'm with you here he was stupid going into the cage to get the cell phone yes but he ran now if 
[02:52:00]  you're in the lion cage running probably good to get out of the lion cage not like dumb bitch like  smart guy right it's not the place you want to prove your manhood i know you don't stop and make  a call hey hey bob guess where i am yeah i'm in the lion cage my cell phone fell in but i don't want  to run because spazzle call me a dumb bitch like i'm running like a bitch you know you sound a little  angry at this i think most guys would look like a a scared bitch in that situation so that's the 
[02:52:30]  point is he shouldn't have been in the cage in the first place all right i'm with you there okay  all right we've got some instant feedbacks there oh oh yeah gee i'm so surprised one guy who's been  pursuing radio for a very long time uh is thinking about jumping out the window spazzle's got to be one  the most retarded human beings i ever heard have corky do the news that's from scott from mount sinai  i heard uh tom brokaw uh wants to hire spazzle as his correspondent in iraq the barber in jersey 
[02:53:00]  checking in and now our correspondence all right well let's uh move on uh you're going to continue  with the cell phone guy in the cage here yes i'm making a comment all right comment okay i guess  when he hit the cage as he was jumping over to whatever anyway but the lion didn't get him and  it should have because a guy that's stupid okay it's not stupid to drop the cell phone in there 
[02:53:30]  because like okay you got to understand accidents do happen right but the guy went after the cell phone  now a guy is rich enough to have a cell phone in the first place nowadays you got to have money to  have a cell phone what big bumps people wait wait wait wait it's fast it's it's the year 2000  cell phones now are pretty much commonplace with everybody you see kids in malls with cell phones  and i don't think it's as expensive as it was maybe uh you know five ten years ago when when uh when uh 
[02:54:00]  uh uh uh uh oh canon thank you when he had the phone you ever watch the tv show canon from the 70s  the detective guy canon and he'd have his his car phone and it was an actual phone with like the  curly wire that went into the hump between his seats and he'd pick up the phone mobile operator  it's canon connect me with 555-1212 and like they connect and that was the old days and that one  call cost them 800 to make very expensive back then yes and then there were the cell phones of the 80s 
[02:54:30]  that with like a big freaking carrying case you had to walk around with you'd have the phone with  the curly q wire that went into this bag you had to carry with you now with the flip of a little  piece of plastic you're talking on the cell phone for rates that are cheaper than ever so you know if  you drop it in the lion's cage hey i guess you could leave it you know just call us nokia and go  hey i lost my phone right fell into the lion's cage all right let's go to rob because he's yelling 
[02:55:00]  rob what's up yo you asking idiot what the hell is the matter with you like do you even do you  hear yourself come on yes like come on the vatican is its own country that's like the first thing  like oh yes vatican city is indeed its own country uh in italy yeah uh italian women are beautiful  they're like so lovely man you just want to like move but come on oh it's the biggest oh i just want 
[02:55:30]  to just come out there and get the hell out of you wait he sure gets a reaction doesn't he he's not  even editorializing the news that much is he all right well well thank you rob thank you rob rob  checking in with a little uh feedback a little feedback on on your news broadcast ryan at line  one calling spaz the king of the gimps he's like the gimp from the oscars while spaz is grabbing a  newspaper doing the news and he's convulsing on the floor all right and let's move on here um so 
[02:56:00]  we're in the middle of the cell phone uh story let's uh recap a little bit a guy must have been rich  because he had a cell phone dropped the cell phone in the lion's cage uh the stupid f went in to get  the the thing and ran out like a little bitch and he got minor bruises and abrasions that's where we leave  you and now we what the hell is he saying my two-year-old daughter talks better than that 
[02:56:30]  and this is what i've just hit it uh lj from new york and you plan on doing this every friday why not  make spaz the morning show and see if the ratings will drop past the point three let me tell you  something i would listen to this every every single morning this would be a great morning show yes  spaz with the news and he's a dumb bitch driving because he's rich with a cell phone all right  let's uh and let's get back to the story all right can't wait to hear what uh what it comes up with  next here so if he if he has a lot of money to have a cell phone in the first place and he 
[02:57:00]  isolate that we need that yeah let me hear that well why are you like it sounds like you just smoked  like 10 bones and you got cotton mouth and no ice cake listen listen so oh my god compare that with  scotso's okay so oh my god you sound like a goddamn pelican swallowing a trout 
[02:57:30]  god damn dude what happened there all right we're going to compare the scott muni um lip smacking  here's the scott muni lip smacking after oh soul of me oh  so  me  all right 
[02:58:00]  all right that's got so on and here's uh spaz so  wow you're learning from the master i learned a lot from scotso  you are learning out here at any w  i don't know okay so i don't know a little water maybe obviously he has something to say because he  started i don't know with so if he has enough money to have a cell phone in the first place and  he dropped it and their accidents happen either get a zookeeper who is trained trained with lions i 
[02:58:30]  would assume otherwise he wouldn't be working in the zoo but he is trained with lines so he would know how  to tame it so he can get the cell phone out for this guy no but the guy's got to take him to his  own hands and jump into the cage like an idiot moron man this is gonna suck donkey bars  anyway so he got the cell phone minus scratches bruises he should have been killed  why because we don't need another dumb schmuck in the world like this guy 
[02:59:00]  oh yeah that makes sense to me the guy's mexican  oh my god wait i forgot how racist this guy is too  it makes sense because he's mexican why does it make sense because he's mexican what does that have 
[02:59:30]  to do about dropping a cell phone into the lion cage because a lot of them don't know their ass from  their whatever oh my god and now earlier was saying that people are behind the times in mexico yes but  now this guy's rich enough to have a cell phone it totally undermines your opinion of mexicans as  being lazy slovenly poor of people if this guy is rich enough to afford he's laughing so hard i think  he just puked a cell phone yeah but mexicans know how to scam to get money oh is that it okay 
[03:00:00]  all right oh my god and if you get a stereotype wouldn't it be like the polish people are  are stupid and would do something like that yeah i'm part polish myself oh so you want to keep the  polish people out of it okay all right are we on to another story yes unfortunately we just began  this so we're gonna have to start the show tomorrow with this oh my god we have another solid solid  20 minutes of this all right let's get maybe one more story in before we have to wrap it up for today 
[03:00:30]  oh man like i said behind in the times anyway what else is also happening an inmate  and in solitary i believe on death room he says and i quote that if you don't get me a pet parakeet  because this guy wanted a pet parakeet for some odd reason okay hold on all right everybody please  put your snack trays away put your seats in their full upright position and fasten your seat belt  because i think this could uh this might win as the most offensive song right i think without music 
[03:01:00]  just put music to it so an inmate looking for a parakeet on death row and here's a quote i need  me a parrot what did he say i i give me a parakeet or kill me okay and here we go you know how lonely  you get in jail that's it's either bubba or some other form and i guess he wanted a parakeet in his ass  what this is great come on come on all right i am so glad we went on vacation this is priceless
