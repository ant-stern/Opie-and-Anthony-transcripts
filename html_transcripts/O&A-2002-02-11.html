<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of a bumpy flight, during which host Ben simultaneously drank two Sam Adams.  Jim recounted his repeated selection for extra security screenings at airports, sparking a conversation about racial profiling.  The show then heavily featured their "Naughty Nighty" (later referred to as "Naughty Ninety") contest, a listener-voted competition showcasing scantily clad women.  Numerous photos were reviewed and discussed in explicit detail, with the hosts making frequent sexually explicit comments about the contestants' appearances and bodies.  Several contestants called in, including Megan (#58) from California and Tarina (#77, initially listed as Karen) from Buffalo, with the latter engaging in a heated exchange with a host.  A caller, Ricky from New Orleans, also insulted Tarina.  Steve Garland, a program director from a participating radio station, called to defend against accusations of using professional models.  A mysterious male guest was present in studio throughout this segment, his reactions to the photos frequently referenced.  The hosts also promoted Jim Norton's stand-up tour.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on the hosts' Mardi Gras experiences in New Orleans.  This included detailed accounts of excessive drinking (Bloody Marys, hand grenades, Hurricanes), encounters with intoxicated and disrobing women, street shenanigans, and various chaotic incidents like fights, pickpockets, and witnessing a police procedure involving shirtless urination, and a horse defecating on Bourbon Street. Tom, a branch manager at a New Orleans radio station who joined them, was a major focus.  His wife's revealing picture on his website and a photo of a pantless Tom were discussed at length.  A physical altercation between Jim Norton (present in studio) and Tom's station owner, resulting from Tom licking Norton's head, was recounted.  Multiple callers shared their own Mardi Gras experiences, confirming the debaucherous atmosphere.  Frenchie and Marion, described as "dueling retards," were also present in the studio, engaging in a vulgar shouting match during the "Naughty Nighty" segments.

The show also included a lengthy segment mocking Star Jones, detailing criticisms of her weight, mobility, and behavior on *The View*,  with explicit descriptions of her appearance and speculative anecdotes about her interactions with celebrities, including a purported non-sexual massage and frequent cheesesteak consumption.  Listener calls contributed humorous anecdotes and complaints, including claims of double-voting in the contest, discussions of voting strategies, and opinions on the attractiveness of women from different cities.  A "Bitches That'll Get You Sucks to Be You" segment featured listener-submitted stories of unfortunate events, including a drowning, a python-related death, a mistaken death pronouncement, and O.J. Simpson's encounter in Philadelphia.  The broadcast also included playing audio of a "Hummer Chick" performing oral sex during Mardi Gras and audio of a seemingly deceased woman regaining consciousness.  A live, on-air attempt to arrange a blowjob for a listener by a woman named "Oasis" from a Mardi Gras event was ultimately aborted due to legal concerns.  The show concluded with further discussion of the "Naughty Nighty" contest, listener calls, and promotional announcements.  The recurring segment, "What did we learn?", featuring listener-submitted observations, was also included.

[00:08:00]  where did you hire the engineering crew?  um  you know that the last half hour of Friday show was such a cluster F and we  we got to the bottom of it that your engineers down there were completely hammered  no it wasn't  switches  they were  they were dancing to the music so much that uh...  they're skipping records  the intro music  out of commercials  that they were skipping  oh yeah  that was  yeah that was a privately contracted deal  I wasn't involved in that  our engineer up here in New York was so pissed off Pete  well Pete Johnson prides himself on being one of uh... Infinity Broadcasting's greatest engineers of all time 
[00:08:30]  and when he saw these engineers just acting like that  he was like  where  where could I get  uh... take away their engineering cards  they are a disgrace to the engineers of America  I'm gonna get to the bottom of that  I'm gonna look into that  that's uh...  Jim Norton  Jim Norton's in the studio  and I don't even think he wants to talk to you  because  I gotta tell everyone  after the broadcast on Friday  uh... 
[00:09:00]  Tom decided that he needed to lick Jim Norton's head  his head  oh my god  did you lick his head?  twice  I think I did  twice  licked his head from ear to ear  from one ear all the way up  over the top to the other ear  and then uh... the owner there, Kim  uh... puts uh... Jim into a...  into a headlock  and is pretty much gonna wrestle him to the ground  and Jim uh... basically got in a fight with the uh... the owner of your station there, Tom 
[00:09:30]  I thought he was attacking me  he was attacking me  I'm standing on a...  I got one foot up on a chair  and I'm tying my shoe  and he just kinda falls on me  and he's like  rawr rawr rawr  and I'm like he's trying to throw me to the ground  so I just shoved him  Norton's got a temper on him, huh?  well, yeah  well, you know, Jim doesn't drink  he doesn't party  well, he parties  but he doesn't do the drugs  and what was the thing?  he's a recovering addict  I just don't smoke pot and I don't drink  although I will say your wife was very sexy  she was very sexy  I have to say that  she was very sexy 
[00:10:00]  so is your head  your head tasted good  this guy was an awful  just licked my head  and then I pull it out  and I'm like  what are you gonna do about this fella  and he just ignores it  wait, Stephanie wants in here  Stephanie, what's going on?  hey Ope, I think that the insomnia is coming from that cocaine you do, you know?  maybe that was it  all that coke  that's probably it  all that coke  he had Tom going  I thought he skated on the air  I could tell  I hear it  I hear it in his voice  we so had Tom convinced that we were all just drug fiends  and we each had our drug of choice 
[00:10:30]  like one of us needed ecstasy  Opie was like a severe coke head  I'll get you anything you need  what do you need?  anything  and Opie needed cocaine  and Tom was just a little bit horrified  at the thought of  maybe actually having to go and get this stuff for us  you know, I was just trying to keep you guys happy  that's all  see how I am?  Opie's the coke head  and the only one he had right was that I like hookers  that was the only one 
[00:11:00]  right  I did have that right  that was true  that was true  that was accurate  alright  well Tom, we're gonna let you go, alright?  alright, I got a lot of work to do today  I got a lot of work to do today  I bet  you sound very tired  you know, I've been working all weekend man  now, you know, Mardi Gras is going on  until tomorrow  tomorrow  so, yeah, so what are you gonna do?  are you gonna hang out and drink some more?  yeah, I guess you got to, you know  it's all part of the job  that city can kick your ass, I'll tell you  especially when you do the Mardi Gras thing 
[00:11:30]  it can man, it's not for the light hearted  alright  people that don't drink  alright Tom, we gotta go  alright guys, y'all have a good one  how you guys doing?  see ya  there he goes  see ya Tom  our new friend  he goes, not for the light hearted  how you guys doing?  over and over again  how you guys doing?  he's got that accent man  how you guys doing?  that partying ain't for the light hearted  he's got that accent, it's great  the friggin hand grenade 
[00:12:00]  what about driving to the airport Ben?  we look out the window of the car  and there's a guy driving  drinking a hand grenade  they just drink everywhere  those hand grenades are like  the last nail in everyone's coffin  that's the one where you just swig it down  and you are done  we were going probably 60 on the highway  we look over, the guy's just drinking a hand grenade  drinking a hand grenade  out of the big hand grenade glass  that you can't even drive and drink with  just horrible  everyone, you know, and you got the red tongues 
[00:12:30]  everyone's got the red mouth from the hurricanes  the mark of the hurricane  yeah  that was a good time though  hey Steve, what's going on?  how you doing?  alright  let me ask you a question about the cops down there  when I was down in Mardi Gras a couple years ago  if they caught you taking a leak  they made you take off your shirt  and wipe it up with it  otherwise they would arrest you  you had the choice  really?  yeah, we saw some sick crap man  we were at this stuff magazine party  overlooking the street  we were up on the balcony  they had a holding pen  right under the party we were at 
[00:13:00]  and we were seeing some wild things man  oh yeah  they were arresting them by  I don't know  hundreds of people were getting arrested  hundreds  did you get to see the horses take out the crowd?  yeah  we did  that is insane  I swear to god  I felt like I was living on Planet of the Apes  it was great  and the reason I say that  you know the scene in Planet of the Apes  when the horses come and everyone just starts fleeing like crazy  scattering and they run right over them  that's what was going on at Mardi Gras  I mean  the Bourbon Street  I mean 
[00:13:30]  it takes you 20 minutes to walk a block  that is how crowded it is  but if a horse  hold on  hold on  but if a horse wants to get through  they don't care  the horse is getting through within seconds  and people just part like the Red Sea  and try to get out of the way as fast as possible  I thought the best part was me and Oprah standing up on the balcony  watching this horse  and it took probably a 40 pound dump  and it was so great  it was probably the biggest pile of horse crap I've ever seen  ever  and you could smell it from the balcony  yeah 
[00:14:00]  but there were hundreds of people on our balcony  and hundreds of people on the balcony  you know across the side street  that was kinda perpendicular to Bourbon  if you know what I'm saying  we were kinda right there  both of us were on the corners  ok  and a huge pile of horse crap  you got hundreds of people just staring at the horse crap from above  and every time someone would walk through it  the whole crowd would go  ohhhh  and no one down below really knew what was going on  because you can't really see the horse crap  one girl falls and almost 
[00:14:30]  almost takes out the whole pile  oh that would have been classic  she slipped in it  she slipped  but she was able to like you know  get herself together before she went down in the pile  I'll tell you  if you could get up  if you could get up on those balconies  it is just  going down to Mardi Gras  as a license  to pretty much throw rocks at people  we were taking the beads  and we had some big  heavy beads  not the little lightweight ones  and I twisted up into a ball  about snowball size  in my hand  and looked down 
[00:15:00]  and just wail it  on people's heads  into their drinks  and they're so drunk  they don't care  they love it  and I was going for the drinks  you know  so one guy is walking down the sidewalk  oh that guy  that guy  and just take it  and one second  he's just walking  minding his own business  got his drink in his hand  the next  wham  drink's gone  and he's looking around like  what happened  what the  and it's so much fun  nice  everything you know  when you go down the street  you know you're just  a victim too  anything can happen down there 
[00:15:30]  it took  about 50 minutes or so  almost an hour  to walk about a block  that's what I was saying  at least  I was saying about  20 minutes per block  yeah  all  you have control of your own motion  the crowd just takes you  yeah you don't really walk  that's funny you say walk in  yeah  you go with the crowd  the river of people  and you just hope  you see where you have to go across the street  and you're just hoping that  you could kind of push your way through  as they're pushing you sideways  and get to your location  you know what it is though 
[00:16:00]  if you're in that river of people moving  why would you stop to chat  you can't  you know  no people do  I was behind a few people  you'd be moving  it's moving  all of a sudden the guy like  hey man  where you from  you know  this was just moving  now it's not  because you're stopped  someone should lay a bottle over your head  alright Steve  thank you  alright  the horse crap thing  was one of the highlights for me  because it was just so funny  just hundreds of really wasted people going  oh  every time someone stepped in 
[00:16:30]  I did try to cop a feel too  I gotta be honest  we were walking  I know you did  and I was offended by that  oh you got slapped  well my hand  Stinky got slapped  Stinky got slapped  Stinky got slapped  Stinky got smacked  so hard in the face  what?  what happened to Stinky?  at the stuff party right?  yeah  what did he do?  Stinky was drunk off his ass  it was obliterate  Stinky tell everyone what you did  some girl was walking around with big boobs  and some orange 
[00:17:00]  so she walked by  I just pinched a string in the back  and she kept walking  and it came unraveled  she turned around  and clocked me  with a ring on her finger  right in the ear  yeah  you hear how he made it sound?  here's what he did  he untied her friggin top  I pinched the string  and she kept walking  you know she walked right onto my junk  they call it rape  but I was there junk out  and she walked into it  it's too bad you didn't have a golf club 
[00:17:30]  you untied her bikini top  and she spun around  and smacked you  but nothing came out  and started crying  yeah she did cry though  yeah  yeah  she was crying  she got all frustrated  and then  well any 11 year old  would have started crying  now you're really sick  Jim copped a feel on a girl  she had like body paint on  you know how they paint up the whole front  so it looks like they're wearing a top  and they're not  and you realize oh my god  that's her boobs  just kind of  you know flowing in the wind

[00:30:00]  and just imagine as you're trying to do that radio show there are two to three hundred people squished all around you drunk trying to talk to you like you're not on the air  yeah  see that's what we need next time when we do something like this i was saying is a place that we can go to get away from everything  how you guys do it  and yeah and that  like that  and do the show  how you guys do it  this is the guy that runs the radio station we're broadcasting uh... from down there okay  yeah  this guy this is what he's saying to us as we're trying to do radio  how you guys do it  like tom we're on the air shut up 
[00:30:30]  we thought he would keep you know things under control for us  no other  and then we find out the engineers are getting drunk  no other job puts themselves in that situation like  hey we uh... run an auto mechanic shop and we're gonna go down to mardi gras drink and try to fix cars  with people screaming around  right  it got to the point where it was impossible  hey you know i'm a dentist i'm gonna set up a chair on bourbon street and do some dental work  what's a couple of cold ones  right tom  but we had no we had no neutral ground we had no place to go that was not outside of this

Oh, I've got to check it out. Really hot. 
[01:03:30]  ONA, this is a really tough contest.  Really tough pick and a winner. So much to choose from. However, I've  selected three palate cleansers. And then he gives three numbers.  He goes, after you've viewed a potential winner, view one of these  and he gives the three numbers so you can start fresh and not be influenced  by the previous hottie. And then he has  his listed hotties that he has picked. But he gives the three numbers  of what he calls the palate cleansers. Palate cleansers. Like smelling 
[01:04:00]  coffee grinds in between colognes. Right. You've got to kind of  you can't look at a hottie and then go right to another hottie.  Well, you've got to vote for the Naughty Naughty Contest now. We've got 90  someone's telling me we've got 98 contestants. Not 97. We've got to get it down  to 20 and then the serious voting will start. You're allowed to vote every day  once. There you go. Just in case you may have a few girls that you're still  deciding upon. All right. Right. All right. 
[01:04:30]  Tom in  Philly. Tom, what's up, bro? A lot of Tom's calling us. You guys were just talking about  Char Jones, right? Star Jones was down in Philly for the All-Star weekend there.  Dude, it was... I'll tell you what. I've never seen so many black people  in my life. Did you know there was black people in Vermont?  What are you talking about? Dude, I can't wait. Vermont,  Rhode Island, these days. I saw they drive  those SUVs, the escalators  and excursions and all that. Escalators.  Dude, it said...  I just read the paper today. It said 
[01:05:00]  Char Jones was at Pat's... or Geno's Speaks  at 3 o'clock in the morning on  Saturday. Underneath it said she visited  it two or three more times in the next two hours.  All right. What'd I say? Don't be a jackass.  All right, Tom. All right, guys.  You suck. That's not funny.  Jeez. Come on, Tom.  Basically, the local paper saying that Star Jones  went to a steak place three times. Can we confirm that?  Not really.  Was it in the paper?  You look at her. It's the only confirmation I need.  I'm hungry. Boy, I just ate and worked up 
[01:05:30]  quite an appetite.  So, Star Jones on The View this morning.  Yeah.  She's talking about her All-Star weekend  down there in Philly.  Oh, how is that?  Was she talking about how, like,  everyone was thinking she was hot?  No.  Ugh.  She was pretty much talking about how  she got to hang with all the important people.  There was Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier over there.  Well, that's the two.  Such and such over here.  I watched once, and I think they were talking 
[01:06:00]  about Denzel Washington or something.  And the other women on the show  were so condescending because Star Jones was like,  and then I met Denzel.  And they're like, oh, well, anything happened?  Was there anything?  No, no.  You know, I was trying.  Do any of those dopey broads actually think  Denzel Washington is going to take a shot at Star Jones?  Maybe Denzel's the chubby chaser, and you don't know.  I wouldn't think so.  In fact, people need loving, too.  I think there's plenty of chicks in line 
[01:06:30]  on Denzel's short list before Star Jones.  The chubby ones?  But that's just it.  Like, it doesn't matter who they're talking about.  They could be talking about some other guy  and Star Jones that met him,  and then they all go, Barbara Walters  and the one, what's the comic's name there?  Norton, you know.  Joy Behar.  Joy Behar.  They'll all go, oh, yeah, any sparks?  There was sparks flying off her jaw  when she was eating  like a wood chipper that had a board with a nail in it. 
[01:07:00]  It's the only sparks coming off of Star Jones.  And they're talking to her like no one is watching going,  get out of here,  like Billy Dee Williams is going to go up to her  or any of the other guys that she hooks up with.  Oh, yeah?  Anything happen?  I don't know.  I was eating.  Food flying in front of my eyes.  I couldn't tell if he was looking at me.  With love in his eyes.  So, did you see Michael Jordan?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Any sparks happening? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, I'd love to get with that.  Yeah, I'd love to get with that.  Yeah.  I wear the shoes.  It's all in the shoes.  I put the shoes on.  I can run through the buffet like faster than ever.  He can thunk my basket.  Oh.  Jesus.  Who's crapping who here?  He can thunk my basket with some dinner roll.  Because it's just cute for fat girls to be, you know,  just joking about the boys.  And it would be actually interesting  if someone just put their head through a curtain  and went, shut up, you fat pig.  And then the curtain closed again. 
[01:08:00]  So, she's delusional.  And they set it up.  It's such a politically correct program  because she does all the spots on the beauty  and the pampering.  Pampering?  She needs for pampering?  I saw the blacksmith used to come and pamper my horse  the same way.  They pull the old shoes off,  put the new ones on.  Well, she's talking about how she went to a day spa  and filled her way into a day spa  while she was down there for All-Star Weekend. 
[01:08:30]  Day spa.  And the look of horror on those poor bastards' faces.  Must be like the pit crew from Daytona  working on Star Jones.  Do my nails.  I need these talons to pick up small game  on the way home.  I use my good eyesight to find the rodent  and then I swoop down on them,  grab them with the talons,  eat them in one bite.  Ooh, that's good.  So she had to sign a form at this day spa. 
[01:09:00]  They call it a day spa  because it took all day for them  to shove my fat ass through the door.  I'm Star Jones, I'm a diva.  So she had to sign a form at this day spa.  Sign a form.  Acknowledging that she was going to get  a one-hour, non-sexual-er,  sexual massage.  What?  She had to sign something that said that?  Yeah.  Non-sexual massage.  Well, a lot of these, you know,  a lot of these places  are getting in trouble for the digit thing.  Oh, I can see that. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, dude, even that chink  wouldn't have touched her.  She's awful.  So she's signing a form  acknowledging she's getting  a non-sexual massage.  No touching.  Ugh.  Come on, give me the happy ending.  For her, a happy ending  is cheesecake shoved into her mouth.  David, what's up?  That spectacle.  This am a happy ending.  David.  Hey, listen.  Yeah.  That was no day spa.  That was a car wash. 
[01:10:00]  I like when the bubbly rags  come and brush on me.  That's good.  I like going to ones  with the Mexicans  that climb up on the ladders  to get my top.  A car wash.  Pampering.  And then she also says,  you know,  not only a diva,  I'm a lawyer too,  so I'm smart,  so shut up.  Like she's got this whole image  that all the other girls  on the show,  all the girls  on the show  just perpetuate  and it's not real. 
[01:10:30]  If that woman  wasn't on  that TV show,  she'd be mocked  as she walked down  the sidewalk.  Look at this, man.  YSP right on top of it, man.  We were talking about  the little story  that appeared in the paper.  Al Roker without junk.  That's what,  and I'm not even sure.  And a wig.  And a wig, yeah.  You know what?  I've never seen those two people  in the same place.  There's another thing,  she would talk about a wig  because she comes in  with these wacky hairstyles  all the time.  Look at my hair.  Oh, your hair looks so good 
[01:11:00]  today, Star.  Yeah, I know.  I look good.  And she was talking about one day,  I have wigs.  I got lots of wigs.  I'm a wig guy.  So in the off chance,  she gets some guy  that wants that fat ass  to go to bed with her,  she's got to pop that lid.  Imagine waking up next to that.  Hey, Al, tell me the weather.  What's the weather  going to be like in my town?  Know what I picture?  Yeah.  Remember that little doggy  that Dino was in love with  and then the doggy 
[01:11:30]  took off the wig?  Sassy.  The fake eyelashes and stuff?  Sassy.  Sassy, yeah.  I remember that.  Yeah, I remember that.  And Dino went to date with her  and he was all psyched.  He looked in the dressing room,  she pulls the big eyelashes off,  takes the wig off,  and she looks horrible.  Took the makeup off.  That's like stuff.  Come on, baby.  Come on, Denzel.  I'm ready to give up the booty.  Booty?  And that's just a bunch  of fat housewives  watching that  because it somehow  makes them feel like  they're not as disgusting  as we all know they are. 
[01:12:00]  And two DJs  that care about show prep,  dick.  All right, yeah,  a bunch of fat housewives  and two DJs  who care about show prep.  Yeah,  so they can entertain  18 cities.  You know what?  When they see Diva  and she's mingling  with everyone at the All-Star,  she's talking about  how pampered,  and the other girls  tell her how beautiful  it is and everything,  they could sit  and shove that next Twinkie  into their mouth  and not feel as bad  as they did a minute ago.  Because the term BBW,  every fat chick  is using this now, 
[01:12:30]  which means  big, beautiful woman.  I'm a BBW.  Yeah,  and you can be  a big, beautiful.  There are fat chicks  that are really attractive,  but just because you're fat  doesn't mean  you're a big, beautiful woman.  BFP should be  a very popular one.  Big fat chick.  Should be abbreviated  next to most of them.  Yeah.  How about BFW?  What?  Big filthy whore.  All right.  Big blue whale.  Big blue whale.  BBW.  See it at the Museum  of Natural History. 
[01:13:00]  So Philly sent the article.  Yeah.  It says,  Cheesesteak machine Geno's  felt the sizzle  of star power yesterday  in the wee hours  of the morning.  The View host Star Jones  came at about 8 a.m.  and returned at least  twice more  in the next two hours,  each time ordering  a cheesesteak  with provolone and onions.  8 a.m.  Oh, my God.  Just feed it.  Feed the pain  of something.  Yep.  There's some pain  you're feeding there.  Don't address it.  So she got the massage 
[01:13:30]  and I get the massage.  Work on my thighs.  Come on.  Knead them.  Knead them thighs.  I need you to give me  a massage  because I got to hold up  this big, fat,  bulbous body with it.  Walks out on the show,  she's got to waddle.  She can't even walk.  How unfair is life  that John Candy  and Farley are dead  and Lenny Bruce  overdose  and this cow  is shoving cheesesteaks  into her mouth  at 8 in the morning.  Disgusting.  Mm-hmm. 
[01:14:00]  Mm-hmm.  Big Kev.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I was down in Philly  on Saturday  down on South Street.  Well, you weren't  getting cheesesteaks, too.  Not that early, no.  Jesus Christ, Kev.  Listen, I don't know  what you were saying,  BBW.  She was a BMW.  Why?  I saw her walking around  with something in one hand  in a big wad of paper  and a big other hand.  It was like a zoo down there.  It was unbelievable.  I was at Pat's  having a steak 
[01:14:30]  and there was just  a whole mob  across the street,  I guess around 11 o'clock  when she was there.  Did she have  Raj and Dee with her?  Yeah.  Was she bouncing  the basketball  down South Street?  No, she was bouncing  down South Street  but there was no basketball.  Hey, did you ever see  a rerun in Vice Squad?  Fred Berry played  a sugar pimp  named Dorsey  in Vice Squad  and he got his chesties  cut out by Wings Houser.  Wings Houser.  He cut his, 
[01:15:00]  he drove a knife  into his groin area  and then Fred Berry went,  ooooh!  It was the greatest  movie performance ever.  Jack from Fonnydale  saying,  BBW,  how about  she's a BMW?  That's what Kevin  just said.  I wasn't listening  to you, Big Kev.  I was reading.  Oh, I see.  Sorry.  All right, Kev.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  I was reading  a funny comment  on the instant feedback  about a BMW.  Do you want to hear it?  We don't have to.  Well, we have to catch up 
[01:15:30]  so we've got to  break again.  Damn.  Break for food.  I hate when that happens.  I'm a diva.  The worst thing,  though,  was the wax.  The ear wax thing.  We've talked about that.  She actually get this.  You sit and watch  in that god-awful show.  They were talking about  how to, you know,  a little more pampering.  Get the wax out of your ears.  Now, there's doctors  you go to.  There's fluids.  There's liquid.  No, this is a good one.  I lay on my side.  I take a straw.  It's covered in wax.  You buy this thing.  You put it in your ear  and light the end  of the straw.  The change in pressure 
[01:16:00]  as the thing burns  and it will pull the wax  out of your ear  and into this straw.  When they're done,  they peel it back  and showed a big brown tube  of Star Jones ear wax.  That's my ear wax.  Why don't she pamper herself  with a sit-up?  She is really  a disgusting creature.  And just stop acting  like it's beautiful.  I don't care if you're like,  hey, I'm a big girl.  All right.  There's a lot of guys  that think that's hot.  But don't walk around like you.  Stop trying to create  that illusion  that you're as hot  as Halle Berry 
[01:16:30]  or any other chick  that works on herself.  There you go.  I'm not as good looking  as 95% of the guys  in this country.  I don't pretend to be.  I don't think  I have a good chin.  Look at this.  He's shaking his fat.  That's the fat  that I'm pinching.  I know I'm a four.  Did you see the BBW  beauty show they had?  They had a fashion show?  No.  What's the big agency  that does that?  That was for Lane Bryant.  Yeah.  I saw a clip  on CNN of it.  And there it is.  They're coming down  the runway  in clothes  that you'd normally see 
[01:17:00]  on slender model gals.  But they're the big girls.  And you know,  some of them  were very pretty.  Yeah.  Very pretty.  But the worst part  of this whole thing  was Kiss  was playing behind them.  So they had a bunch  of gay men  who were there  watching the fashion show  and fat broads  in the audience  watching these models  not even looking  because they're looking  at the runway.  Behind the runway  no one even looking at them.  There's Kiss  playing  and I'm just like  unbelievable. 
[01:17:30]  Just take the money, Gene.  Hey, why not, man?  What was first prize  for the fat chicks  a week on a Japanese  fishing boat?  There's nothing sexy  about you.  You can't figure  how annoyed  they're getting either.  He's a pig.  He's a dirty man.  Sorry.  I don't like fatty hunting.  Yuri!  Hey, what's up?  It's Yuri.  All right, well.  Whatever.  It's more like a BLT  than a fat hog.  Instead of BBW, BLT.  There you go.  That's funny.

[01:19:00]  because we out-shocked  Mardi Gras  when we were down there  last Friday.  And we got that audio as well.  Hey, this is Jim Brewer.  Oh, yeah!  The there is about to rock!  Fire!  You listen to Opie and Anthony  The Opie and Anthony Show  1027 WNEW  Yeah, we're back with  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers  in the New York area. 
[01:19:30]  877-692-1027  Anywhere else  866-277-4WOW  Chris has something else  that was going on  in Philly over the weekend.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, you guys here?  Yeah, what's up, bro?  Yo, Saturday  during the All-Star Game  or Briar to the All-Star Game  and it was really nice  here Saturday.  O.J.  in a convertible Bentley  at 4th and South.  He was on South Street?  Yeah, in a convertible Bentley!  Oh, hell,  almost broke loose.  Really? 
[01:20:00]  Somebody finally spots him.  Hey, O.J., O.J.,  murderer, murderer.  The car gets surrounded.  People everywhere  finally realizing it's O.J.  Yeah.  The place is going nuts.  O.J. panics.  The driver in the car  is sitting there  with a load in his pants  like you can't believe.  Wow.  They're sitting there.  The place was going crazy  just chanting  murderer, murderer, murderer.  Jeez.  The driver reaches down,  puts the top up.  Couldn't move the car.  Now, what's the last resort  they do?  They call the cops. 
[01:20:30]  The cop shows up.  The cop's like,  oh, Christ.  Looks in the car.  It's O.J.  Like, you know,  he's really excited  to help O.J. out, huh?  Right.  So, uh,  the cop is very, very reluctant  to help O.J. move  his $300,000 Bentley  out of the middle  of South Street.  Classic.  Wow.  The place went nuts.  Yeah, they're faxing us  the article  that appeared  in the Philly paper  today, I guess.  Yeah.  Star Jones is a big,  fat slob.  They've got a picture  of her in this paper  next to Magic Johnson's wife.  Uh-huh.  I think she's, like,  looking at her  Magic Johnson's wife's head  like a big butterball. 
[01:21:00]  They're like,  hmm, I'd like to gnaw  on your arm.  I'm just going to pick.  You don't mind.  I'm just going to rip  your leg out of the socket  and beat you over the head  and eat the rest of you.  Maybe she wants Magic  to give her a dose  so she can drop  a few pounds.  Oh.  Star Jones even beats the AIDS.  I'll eat the AIDS.  I know a guy  that ran into him  over the weekend.  His buddy had a video camera.  Classic.  Ran up to Magic.  Give me a big high five.  No idea what the hell  just hit him upside the head. 
[01:21:30]  A high five.  Sounded like you guys  had a party going on  in Philly over the weekend.  That's insane.  Thank God it's over.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Take it easy, guys.  Burton, you suck.  Thank you, sir.  Norman comes up  with a great line  and he didn't even have  to watch the view  to come up with it.  I got the article  that appeared in the paper  and it says  Juice Squeezed.  The Juice got squeezed  over the weekend.  O.J. Simpson was spotted  cruising down South Street  in the passenger seat  of a top-down  Bentley convertible  Friday afternoon  around four,  but what started  as a friendly encounter 
[01:22:00]  turned ugly  because the Bentley  was stopped  in heavy traffic.  Pedestrians noticed O.J.  and crowded quickly around.  Simpson signed autographs  often on $1 bills  and spoke with fans,  but as the crowd swelled,  shouts of murderer  were heard.  Oh, Jesus.  Why are people  going to chant that?  And then police arrived  and sent the Bentley  on its way.  O.J.  just trying to have a good time,  right?  People got to get over it.  Get over that already  and get on it. 
[01:22:30]  I don't think that was necessary.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  One of the funniest things  you're overlooking  from Friday was  that great marching band  that was coming down the street.  They sounded incredible.  They were great.  All of a sudden,  they got in front of your balcony.  They woke up  and you start hearing  errant tubers  and trombones.  The next thing you hear  is one guy  beating on a drum.  They got to find the tape.  It's hilarious.  It threw the band off,  the marching band.  That needless to say.  All right, I got a rep  on the radio, guys.  All right, yeah,  there was total debauchery 
[01:23:00]  going on.  The band was going  by our balcony  and they had no clue  what was going on.  Well, out of nowhere,  we're trying to do a break.  All of a sudden,  you're like,  what the hell is...  There's a marching band  coming down.  Yeah.  And it was very loud,  but then that's exactly  at the point  that we had Oasis  from down there  doing her thing.  Her thing.  Her thing is to give  hummers to people  on the streets  during Mardi Gras.  And we got the audio.  We're going to play  that in a little bit.  So she was up  on the balcony  and she was on her knees  and going to town. 
[01:23:30]  And all of a sudden,  the band starts looking up.  Now, they're supposed  to look forward.  They're playing  their instruments.  They're supposed  to look forward.  They're all like,  you know,  I think some of the  trombone players figured,  ah, there's other ones  that'll take over for me.  No one's going to notice  one trombone dropping out.  But they all decided  to do that.  So they're looking up  and the guys playing drums  are looking completely  over their shoulders  so they're not even  hitting their drum anymore.  The whole band  just fell apart.  It was hysterical.  But they got a good view  of the hobbing.  God, the Star Jones jokes  are coming like crazy. 
[01:24:00]  I hate it.  Andrew.  Yo.  Go ahead, bro.  What's going on?  You tell me.  I know why Star Jones  was staring at  Maddie Johnson's wife.  Why?  Her name's Cookie Johnson.  Really?  Cookie?  I love cookies.  Let me eat that cookie up.  That's the truth, though.  Her name is Cookie.  Yeah, no joke.  You guys suck.  Norton rules.  Good job, Andrew.  Oh, what's this?  I tried to get AIDS,  but I digested it.  It's the bitches  out of bitches. 
[01:24:30]  Oh, yeah.  It's the bitches  out of bitches.  This is actually  a combination  bitches out of bitches  and it sucks to be you.  This blows.  And this guy is really stupid  and now he's dead.  He's dead.  He ish.  Oh, no.  How did it happen?  He ish.  Hello.  Can I speak to Jeremy  about sleep?  Oh, he died.  Oh, no.  It's a bitch. 
[01:25:00]  How did it happen?  This is the herring house.  It's a bitches out of bitches.  Remember that one, Annette?  Yeah.  This is the herring house.  It's a bitches out of bitches.  Oh, no.  Yeah, so, uh, he's dead.  No.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.  Yes.  No.  No.  Shut up.  No.  Shut up.  No.  Shut up.  Shut up.  No.  Shut up.  No.  Shut up.  No.  Shut up.  No. 
[01:25:30]  Shut up.  No.  Shut up.  No.  I love doing that.  I could do that all day.  Once that OCD gets kicked, it's not going to stop.  It's horrible.  How you guys doing?  Oh, we're doing good.  No.  Thank you.  How you guys doing?  No.  How you guys doing?  No.  My bad.  Yeah.  Well, here we go.  So it's a combo. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bitches that'll get you.  And sucks to be you.  Baltimore.  25-year-old Baltimore man Sunday morning trying to pull his girlfriend out of the harbor at  Fells Point in Baltimore.  Police identified 25-year-old Jeremy Baxley of Baltimore on Sunday.  His girlfriend, 24-year-old Patricia Grimes, also Baltimore, survived the incident.  She falls into the water at like 1.15 in the morning.  So she's probably drunk. 
[01:26:30]  They've probably been having some fun.  Her boyfriend jumps in to save her.  He doesn't know how to swim.  The woman's able to get out of the water, not even injured.  She fell in, not even injured.  She was lying on the sidewalk when police arrived.  Um, scuba crew searched for the man's body and it was recovered about 3 in the morning.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[01:27:00]  No.  Yes.  That's horrible.  Hey, Rick, we're going to go back to our house.  We've got a hot tub, baby.  Don't drown.  How many times do you read stuff like that?  The best is when these jackasses jump in after their dogs.  You ever see that with the thin ice?  You know, the ice broke.  His dog went in the water.  He jumped in to get the dog.  They found his body with the dog shivering next to it. 
[01:27:30]  That's more understandable than jumping in to save your girlfriend.  Well, at least all you need for the dog is a little peanut butter on the bag.  You don't have to buy it at dinners and pretend it's not getting fat.  Holy jeez.  You had a rough weekend in New Orleans, huh?  Every girl I date, I just really would love you to fall into ice.  Right into the ice.  Bye-bye.  Hey, we have another It Sucks To Be You around here.  Yeah.  Yeah, this poor guy.  Might as well blow it all out here. 
[01:28:00]  Here's another story you kind of see.  Every so often this happens.  People that love having huge primitive reptiles around their house.  There's always this kind of, like, I don't know what the fixation is with having huge snakes.  Or these big gila monsters or something like that.  Animals that can kill you.  That can kill you.  And you have them around and think that since you raised it from the time it was a little python 
[01:28:30]  and rubbed it under its little detachable jaw.  Big chin.  And you think that somehow that little mite-sized brain in its head is going to develop this affection for you.  Oh, no, it's a snake.  But you know something?  They're better than dogs.  They're more intelligent and capable of love and affection.  No, they're not.  They're frigging dinosaurs is what they are.  And the thing, for no apparent reason, will then turn around and kill you. 
[01:29:00]  And you won't even know what hit you.  Well, that's what happened to this guy.  Ten-foot-long Burmese python.  Why do you need a ten-foot-long Burmese python?  I'll tell you why.  Why?  These are all guys that never dropped any seeds in high school.  Yeah.  And they want people to listen.  They want attention.  It's an attention.  People look at him and go, wow, he's a really dangerous guy, man.  Look at him.  He's got a snake.  He's brave.  I love when your pets turn on you and kill you.  It's true.  You're going to dog, you jackass.  Well, one can only imagine what was going on through this guy's head as he's handling 
[01:29:30]  the snake, showing it to somebody.  Hey, look at my snake.  You want to see my ten-foot-long python?  And the snake weighed 80 pounds, wrapped around the guy's chest, and crushed him.  He could not breathe.  And did it kill him?  It killed him.  And what did his friend do?  What's the friend going to do?  Nothing.  He called the cops.  Stab it or bite it?  Yeah, you would think there's something you can do.  But you know something?  He didn't want to hurt the guy's snake.  He was probably thinking, you know something? 
[01:30:00]  Think about it.  The guy's probably thinking, all right, the snake's wrapped around my body.  He's gasping for air.  If I cut the snake in half, he's going to kick my ass and go, no, what are you doing?  He does this all the time.  So he sat there and watched him die.  Well, hopefully his friend had his hands on his hips and kept going, what did I tell you  was going to happen?  What did I tell you?  I told you.  But these people that actually think that that little pea brain built up an affection for  you is retarded.  Because they have their reptiles.  They have no loyalty, man.  They're not capable of it. 
[01:30:30]  Take them out in the driveway and back over them and laugh and point.  That's what you do to your reptiles.  They're not cute and you're not edgy.  Well, as this guy's blacking out, imagine what's going through his head like, oh, my  God, it is 2002.  If I look at my calendar through my quickly tunneling vision and I glance and see it's  2002, I am being killed as cavemen were hundreds of thousands of years ago. 
[01:31:00]  And you think you could bump it up against a wall?  I mean, I guess snakes are ready for that.  I don't know.  You know something?  That guy wasn't going to move.  You just get the air crushed out of you.  You're done.  Goodbye.  And there he was.  Killed by it.  The cops came and got the snake off him using their police batons.  And they turned him over to animal control, where I'm sure the snake will be killed for  doing what a snake does.  It's supposed to do.  It's supposed to do.  John, what's up?  Hey, O&A, you guys suck. 
[01:31:30]  Thank you, man.  Hey, check this out.  You guys are talking about people doing dumb stuff that's a dog or a girlfriend.  Here in Buffalo, got whacked by a train to yank his dog off the damn tracks.  Oh, trying to get his dog off the tracks and he got hit by a train.  Wasted his life on a damn dog.  That is beautiful.  John, you're breaking up, but thanks.  You figured he could have just went, hey, boy.  Hey, really fast, another, it sucks to be you.  Yeah.  Corpse shocks docks in Brooklyn. 
[01:32:00]  How frightening could this be?  EMS paramedics mistakenly pronounced a 77-year-old Brooklyn woman dead, and it was three hours  before anyone noticed a comatose woman was breathing, and then they rushed her to a hospital,  police said yesterday.  Yeah, she was apparently in a coma, but the EMS people thought she was dead.  Actually thought rigor had set in.  Yeah.  And they called the coroner.  He was going to come over there and zip her up in one of those body bags and ship her  off to the mortuary.  She opened her eyes. 
[01:32:30]  How, oh my God, how big a dump did the coroner take when that happened?  Especially if she said, what are you doing with your fingers?  Oh.  She said, I need a massage.  Thought you passed away.  Wow, look at this story.  The cops entered the apartment on 10th Street, found Foster lying unconscious in the bathroom.  The EMS guys, they pronounced her dead.  Da, da, da, da.  I just couldn't believe it.  After all those hours, she was pronounced dead. 
[01:33:00]  It was unbelievable, said Little John Forty, who lives in Queens.  The coroner came, and he checked her out.  She pulled her arm up, and her eyes opened up, and the coroner said, this woman is alive.  That's why they hire him.  Here's a comment from the coroner that, right as the eyes opened.  Ah!  And it said the same thing.  Ah!  Anthony, we got one of the EMS guys on the phone.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, he wants to say something, because he was one of the guys that pronounced her dead.  Right?  My bad.  Hey, that sounded like our own Tom from down in the water as well.  No, that's one of the EMS guys.  Oh, what?  He's got another comment?  Curls my toes like Patty's toenails.  Hey, well, there you go.  All right.  And one of the younger EMT workers, they had a mic on them, too.  Let's just listen with them.  Yeah.  That's expected. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  When we get back.  Yes.  Right when we get back, we're going to play the audio of the Hummer chick doing what she  does best, and that's great.  On the balcony at Mardi Gras, as we were broadcasting live.  We out-shocked Mardi Gras, Anthony.  What is the...  Oh, oh, good.  We do have a clip of the coroner right when the eyes open.  Sweet, miserable crap!  Wow.  And here's the body, the grandmother. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, thanks, Dick.  Anthony, here's the coroner.  Okay.  The first words the coroner said to the lady after, you know, everyone realized she was  alive.  Sure.  Walk it off, Dick.  All right.  That's good.  Oh, the coroner talking to the EMS people that pronounced their death.  What the hell were you thinking?  Who saw that come? 
[01:35:00]  Oh, we do have the concerned medical staff.  How are you?  Okay.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, let me just check my carts over here.  Just seeing if there was any more audio that Rick carted up today.  No, I think that about does it.  Yeah. 
[01:35:30]  That wasn't appropriate.  I think this is the EMS where I found the coroner alive.  Well, somebody put this retard out of his misery.  Not right.  Well, and I got the EMS guy reacting after seeing the body that he thought was dead.  Hey, who's the stripper?  We have an update on the line.  Oh, we do?  A real update.  Yes.  Oh, geez.  Andrew.  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Hey, I heard that story, too.  Actually, the next day she died in the house. 
[01:36:00]  Thanks.  I'll be here all week.  And we do have her final words before she died.  We're cakes for nothing.  All right.  Great.  Great.  Very good.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Okay.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  A moulinion.  Shut up, Tony Soprano.  Stop.  It's not right.  Poor woman. 
[01:36:30]  Grandma.  Stop.  Is that true?  She said this when they pulled the breathing tube out.  I'm sticking it in my mouth.  Might have saved her.  One of the EMS workers talking to the dead corpse.  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Sir, ma'am.  Whatever.  And her in heaven, if you can believe it.  We have some afterlife audio of her. 
[01:37:00]  I'm moving in now.  All right.  All right.  Well, we got the coroner talking to the family here.  Told a truck called Broil.  Meet you people, eh?  Well, uh...  Oh, now this isn't appropriate.  Was this what one of the EMS people was saying watching her lay there?  Chink, a day's pay for napping on the job.  Yes, sir.  Oh, Anthony.  We got her...  Yes, drilled a bit into the ground.  We got her first words. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, good.  After they realized she actually was alive.  Great.  How are you guys doing?  No, no, that's Tom.  Tom, yeah.  Oh, God.  Maybe being dead, you know, makes your voice sound more manly.  I don't know.  You never know.  Sure.  Oh, okay.  All right.  All right.  Well, we're waiting.  And that's the audio of the listeners telling us they're waiting for something else.  And now, maybe something new from the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  We just wasted another five minutes.  Audio of the Hummercheck.  Yes.  Promise.  Right after the break, okay?  Don't forget, opiananthony.com.  The Naughty Nighty Contest voting has started today.  You can vote once per day for the next week.  We have 98 contestants.  We got to get it down to 20 by next Monday, okay?  20.  So make sure you vote.  Make sure you tell your friends to vote.  You can vote every day because you're not really sure who you want to win.  Right.  You vote for maybe this girl because you like her, and then another girl tomorrow, and 
[01:38:30]  another girl on Wednesday.  We're just finding the semi-finalists.  That's right.  We're going to get it down to 20, and then we're going to have a nice page set up with  thumbnail sketches and all sorts of fun things, okay?  Right.  All right.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I just want to be with a man who would ignore me and take me for granted, and he's only pretending  to be interested in who I am and what I think is going to get in spite of now.  Dirty girls, you love me.  Opie.  And you know where a guy can get a rub and a tug around here? 
[01:39:00]  Answer me.  And E.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area, 877-692-1027.  Anywhere else outside of New York, 866-277-4WOW.  Got a quick thing from Steve from Lyndon Hurst.  He goes, Holly, as the KXOA bonus shot of the three girls from Sacramento, if you want to  pop that up.  Oh, look.  It was already up on my computer. 
[01:39:30]  They're all smiling as they hold up the Sacramento Bee newspaper with a front page picture of  a train derailed and people being killed.  This is why I love hot women.  They can make even the most horrid of situations sexual.  Check out the first picture.  They're holding it up.  You see the train fatal carnage of a train wreck, and the girls are smiling, and you see  some nip poking through the shirts.  Yeah, they're smiling, looking all hot and stuff.  That's the Charlie's Angel shot. 
[01:40:00]  If they could read, that would probably really bother them.  Do you think there's going to be a Sacramento sweep in this contest?  I would be very surprised, and I'm not influencing the contest.  This is just the way I think guys are going to vote.  But I would be very surprised if just about every girl from Sacramento isn't in the top  20.  Yeah, we got it.  Now we're down to the top 20.  I know two that I believe from Sacramento that I don't think will make it in.  But all the other girls are in. 
[01:40:30]  There's no way you can't say these are some of the hottest girls in the contest.  I got to tell you, KXOA, on top of it, Ben just put up their website.  They got it right on the front page.  The voting has begun for the Naughty Naughty Contest.  I hope all the other radio stations we're on will do the same for us.  We want as many people as possible to vote.  And we're hoping that you guys won't play favorites as far as the girls representing your city.  I'll tell you right now, my top three that I'm voting for, none are from New York. 
[01:41:00]  Nope.  And I hope others do the same.  If you think the girl from your city is the hottest, great.  But please, it doesn't matter that much.  I don't foresee that being much of a problem.  We really want the hottest girl in the Naughty Naughty to win the contest.  Yeah, but you don't need hometown voting.  I mean, you don't need Portland, Oregon running away with it.  I don't see this as being a problem because I know guys' loyalty to their city,  it cannot surpass their horniness for hot chicks. 
[01:41:30]  And their hope that, you know, maybe someday if they actually see this chick and say,  I voted for you, that she'd F you.  You're sick, delusional minds of men.  Loyalty to cities.  Loyalty to a relative with cancer isn't as strong as it is for my loyalty to hot box.  Exactly.  And that's why I don't think that's going to be a problem.  Box comes first.  Right.  All right.  NoPinAnthony.com.  The voting has begun.  Ronnie, what's up?  Man, calling from New Orleans.  You guys left too early. 
[01:42:00]  Hey, we're trying to talk us into staying.  Man, we're walking in here.  There's a couple, there's about four hotel rooms on the fifth floor of the Royal Sinesta.  I'm dead serious.  That are open and empty right now.  Oh, man.  I'm five minutes from the Royal Sinesta.  And, dude, the reason that nobody wanted to stay, it was like hanging out on a two-mile colon.  That's what Bourbon Street is like.  Yeah, I hear you, bro.  Bourbon Street can be horrific, man.  It's terrible down there, but it's a party.  Nah, I had a ball. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, that's cool.  A lot of people, like this guy Bill from Boston writes on the SNB back,  where are Tom's wife pictures of her flashing Bourbon Street?  Steve is going home early so he can start working on the video clips and the pictures.  Oh, is he?  Of our trip to Mardi Gras.  Bravo.  Hopefully some stuff will start appearing later on tonight on OpinAnthony.com and FoundryMusic.com.  We have hundreds of pictures and, I don't know, it could be dozens of video clips.  Yes, Jim?  I only got a little peek because I was kind of on the side and it was Tom's wife, 
[01:43:00]  so I didn't want to be, you know, disrespectful.  Gawking.  That's all you have to do is wait until, like, Girls Gone Wild, the new video comes out,  and they'll be on it.  But Girls Gone Wild, they had their own balcony and everything.  They did.  Huge banner.  Big industry.  Big industry.  I got about 15 homemade of those Girls Gone Wild videos.  Get a hold of yourself, sir.  Just buy porn.  What is Girls Gone Wild?  A bunch of drunken pigs splashing with armpit hair.  You are absolutely right.  No, no.  We saw the Girls Gone Wild.  It's much more than that.  Well, they show a lot of clam. 
[01:43:30]  Even if they show clam.  I mean, I'm 33.  That doesn't do it anymore for me.  You want to see.  Her knees are showing.  I want.  God almighty.  I was watching Taboo and Taboo 2 when I was 15.  Some girl showing her little hiney.  It doesn't do it for me.  There's something hot about that, too.  It's an action, Jim.  No, not everything has to be hardcore.  You're right.  There's something hot about it if they're not expecting it.  Like, if they're walking down the street and someone just rips off their skirt  and they film them running and crying.  I mean, who wouldn't whack their bag looking at that? 
[01:44:00]  All right, Ron.  We got to let you go.  Yeah, guys.  I'm glad you all made it back with all your fingers and toes.  Hey, you guys showed us a great time down there, and we'll be back.  All right, man.  Y'all be cool.  What I was saying is that Tom's wife, I was trying not to be a total perv,  her nips were really nice.  Oh, really?  Really?  Big, yeah.  Yeah, I tried not to really gawk.  Ooh, they were lovely.  I wasn't looking that closely.  Oh, I was right there for a while, yeah.  So the whole thing?  I think we were all surprised at how hot Tom's wife was.  And how bad her judgment is. 
[01:44:30]  Exactly.  Well, you can see her on the website.  That picture's on foundrymusic.com.  It's on foundrymusic.com now.  And look in the mirror, and you'll see Tom with his pants down.  Taking the picture.  And a big red blur dot over his junk, because he probably had it just flopping around.  And he probably has a huge mule, because he has like a big, thick New Orleans skull.  He probably has like a mule.  It's probably six by eight.  It's probably wider than it is long.  Big, awful southern mule. 
[01:45:00]  Mike, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right.  Loving the show, man.  It is really great.  I hope the rest of it's down.  Hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Mike, you're from Washington?  Yeah.  Let me read a little email I got from one of your lovely, lovely citizens of Washington.  Okay.  It says, I understand that you guys are popular in many cities.  Congratulations for your success.  Now you need to understand that the D.C. listening populace consists of intelligent people.  Your show, obviously, is not intended for intelligent people. 
[01:45:30]  We generally have better things to do than listen to you talk about breasts.  Yeah, like elect a crack addict, you scumbags.  Shut up, you're not intelligent.  You elected a dope addict as mayor.  Drop dead.  Hold on, hold on.  Please, please recognize that you don't have an audience pool in the D.C. area and do the  right thing and go home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what we'll do.  It's a district.  It's not even a state.  Two words.  She's an uptight soccer mom whose kids should be shooting each other in a high school. 
[01:46:00]  There you go.  Wait a stupid pig.  I'm counting Mike's words.  Two words.  She's a whore.  Okay.  Listen, as far as voting...  So maybe that lady's right.  Here's why her email bugs me.  Instead of just coming out and going, you guys suck, I hate you, you're not funny, I  can always accept hearing someone saying you suck.  Fine.  But don't try to be clever.  Like, well, congratulations.  Stop with that suburban dishonesty.  You pig with a cheating husband.  She is sitting there and pretty much telling everybody in D.C. 
[01:46:30]  She's speaking for everyone in D.C.  We're intelligent.  We don't want this type of radio.  We...  I love when people decide to speak for an entire city or country in some circumstances.  You're nothing.  You are a nothing who speaks for nobody.  And implying that D.C. is more intelligent than New York.  Look at the great mayor that New York had for the last eight years and look what you elected  in that city.  Not that I don't respect his lifestyle, hookers and drugs. 
[01:47:00]  I am completely behind Marion Barry.  I don't mind that.  How dare you come off like that?  A lot of people are having a lot of fun because we don't have an audience in Washington yet.  You just wait.  Just hold your horses, you bitch.  Hey, we have said it many times.  Opie and Anthony always win.  We always win.  We always win in the end.  And how pissed off will that bitch be when we finally have an audience in Washington?  That's what they say down there.  We like intelligence and it's not our brand of humor. 
[01:47:30]  Not our brand.  What a bunch of douches.  Don't listen.  When we do well and it's written about in the papers and it will be, we will do very well  in D.C.  We know it.  Already feeling it from the people.  Right on, man.  Just got to show up in the numbers.  I want another email from that twat.  And I want them for her to explain why, if she spoke for everybody, that they turned  on her and started listening to this program. 
[01:48:00]  Well, they like intelligent stuff.  I mean, the Grishman was on there for years.  I mean, he'd really go for a good radio.  You know, when I was slinging lead, let me now do some calculus problems for the intelligent  listeners.  Waddledoodle.  Hey, Mike.  Yeah.  You wanted to talk about, because I punched it up here.  And of course, how could I forget?  Yeah, let Mike say it.  Go ahead, Mike.  Yeah, guys.  I'm loving the show.  And forget that bitch.  You guys will be huge down here.  As far as the contest is concerned, I'm voting on two criteria. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  How hot the pictures are, and how much I want to spank the monkey.  Okay.  Plain and simple.  And if Stephanie is in top five, then it's got to be rigged.  Yeah, I got to tell you, Stephanie from D.C.  Oh, man.  Is just, look.  Remember her, Norton?  Let's not forget about Bobby from like the first couple of days of the contest from Philly.  She's hot, man.  I'm feeling Lexus, Maureen. 
[01:49:00]  Those are two.  They both sat on my lap, so maybe that's why I have like an affinity.  Where are they?  From here?  One is from Philly, and one is from Boston.  Lexus, let me see.  I saw them in person is the point, so maybe that was the difference.  Yeah.  Well, you know something?  She's looking slutty.  That's a deterrent.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what you really kind of dig.  Which one is?  Lexus, 18.  And who else?  Look at her dumper.  Oh, I already.  And Maureen?  She was in BCN, yeah.  All right.  Let me go to some of the BCN shots.  Let me see. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, that's Lexus.  Oh, just look at her hiney, how perfect it just is.  You like that?  Oh, Jim, I ain't been sweating.  It's all right, young lady.  Watch a little mushroom sniffing.  Jim, that's not intelligent enough.  You're right.  She has quite a gluteus maximus.  All right, Mike, thank you.  Hey, guys.  Norton, you rule.  Come to DC, man.  I'm going to, actually, man.  We get a lot of emails from DC.  Thanks, buddy.  You bet.  Hey, you know what?  Speaking of coming to DC and all that fine stuff, I hold in my hand for immediate release 
[01:50:00]  Monday, February 11th, 2002.  All.  All.  The Yellow Discipline Tour.  Jim Norton from the Opie and Anthony Show.  April 18th.  At the Town Hall right here in New York City.  The nerve of me to be playing that room.  Why is that?  Just all the great entertainment they've had.  Oh, and then you.  Yeah, with my bad blood and my weak chin. 
[01:50:30]  And when do tickets go on sale?  Tickets on sale this Friday at noon.  With your low T-cell count.  Not only are you playing in New York, you're playing all over the place, right?  New York.  Oh, I got your dates.  Philly.  Philly on March 28th.  Boston at Avalon on April 5th.  Cleveland on April 11th.  I Smell Road Trip to Cleveland especially.  Oh, my God.  April 18th, Town Hall here in New York.  And April 26th in Buffalo. 
[01:51:00]  At the Trouth.  The Trouth.  The Trouth?  It's awful.  So it's not a trough?  I don't know.  Was the Leukemia Award booked?  Why would they put me in the Trouth?  Well, here's a great club, but the name is horrendous.  Maybe there's a cute little story.  Well, it was the guy Tom and the guy Ralph, and they just couldn't.  Well, that goes.  Too bad Carl and Munt couldn't.  Munt.  God, if I had any humor, I would have figured out a real name. 
[01:51:30]  What a fat-breasted zilch.  Steve, what's up?  What's up, boys?  Stop being a C-tease and play the Hummer Chick.  Oh, yeah.  We were going to do that right after, O.V.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, right after, like always.  I have a short-term memory problem.  Yeah, I understand.  Those hurricanes suck.  All right, Steve.  No, I can get a rule.  Thanks, bud.  God, I forgot.  You're going to have to tattoo what breaks you want to do on your arm. 
[01:52:00]  So you can remember.  Yeah, I'm on.  Like Memento.  I'm the guy in Memento.  Yeah.  Let's see, on my forearm.  Oh, yeah, Hummer Chick.  Oh, that was a really, really good overrated film.  Oh, you thought that was overrated?  You didn't like Memento?  I liked it.  It was overrated.  I liked the gimmick.  Continually going backwards.  I hate when they don't give you a finality in the ending.  Oh, where it's like, well, it's up to your interpretation what that meant.  No, it's not.  Finish it.  Tell me what happened.  Finish your movie.  Dude, the finality of the whole movie was the first scene.  What do you mean? 
[01:52:30]  Did I miss it?  Maybe I missed it.  I'm not saying it's my way 30 times.  Yeah.  I still don't know what's going on.  Yeah, I cannot figure that one out.  Did you see, um...  Hold on.  Someone's got something really funny.  Oh, did you want to...  Sorry, go ahead.  I just want to say, did you see The Others, that one with, um...  What was that?  Tom Cruise.  Yeah.  Nicole Kidman.  With the kids in the house.  And, uh...  They're all dead.  At the end.  You know that, Opie?  I don't care.  Thank you.  I didn't see it yet, but...  Dude, you haven't seen a movie in five years. 
[01:53:00]  Dude, I saw...  Um, I saw, uh, Hearts in Atlantis when I was, uh, in, uh...  When you're not getting...  And you say you hate movies without an end or something?  What the hell was that movie about?  I get it.  I get it.  That's what I was going to say.  I really loved Hopkins in that.  He's one of the best ever.  Yeah, but...  But the end got...  The end of that movie was like, all right, great.  Take a piece out of a movie somewhere and let me watch it.  Yeah, I know.  Without an ending or anything.  Yeah, it didn't move me at all, but Hopkins was amazing as usual.  Uh, Dan, real fast.  Dan's gonna...  Dan's gonna explain memento to you, Jim.  Okay.  Go ahead, Dan.  Dude, what don't you guys get, man? 
[01:53:30]  I got the whole damn thing.  Tell Jim.  Dude, dude, did he actually kill somebody or didn't he?  Dude, he killed the wife, dude.  Yeah.  That's why he's the Sammy Jenkins guy, basically.  More or less.  And, uh, what's it called?  He, uh...  And what's it called?  Oh, boy.  I took out what I'm saying.  Sorry.  That was well said, sir.  Exactly.  It was as clear as the movie was right there.  No, thank you.  Look, guys, the pressure's on.  We gotta show our intelligence to Washington today.  Yeah.  I know.  And I'm admitting I don't know what happened.  I didn't get it. 
[01:54:00]  Mike has something for you.  We're getting to the audio in a second here.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, I just wanted to ask Norton if he'd be raising hell on his tour.  Dude, I'm gonna call those...  We're working on a new commercial.  If they even think of putting together a commercial, he's Jim Norton.  And he'll be raising hell.  Raising hell.  Like, what type of idiots do they think?  Well, I'd say come to see me, but it's pretty self-explanatory.  They're really rapists, basically.  Hey, look who's...  Look who's not here.  No, you're not here? 
[01:54:30]  Why aren't you here?  Okay, he's giving us hand signs.  He just wants to say hi.  That's cool.  That's cool.  That's cool if you just stop by to say hi and he doesn't want to be here, here.  Uh-huh.  You told your girlfriend you're doing something else?  Oh, is that it?  Okay.  I got the thumbs up.  All right.  All right.  And let's explain the Hummer chick.  The Hummer chick from Mardi Gras, okay?  Yeah.  She's Oasis, her name is.  Yeah.  I think her website is linked to foundrymusic.com.  She pretty much wears a shirt in Mardi Gras that says... 
[01:55:00]  It says slut on the front.  Slut.  And free BJs on the back.  Right.  And she gives them.  She gives them out.  She just walks the street.  And if she feels so inclined, she drops to her knees and goes to town.  And we brought her up on the balcony at the strip club temptations that we were broadcasting  from and got a lucky listener from down on the street.  And she performed on him.  But there was a whole thing because it was illegal.  We weren't supposed to do it.  They were shutting us down. 
[01:55:30]  There were cops running to the club.  All right.  Well, I guess...  Tom panicked.  Yeah.  Out of nowhere, he finally showed some type of responsibility.  Oh, it was so phony responsibility.  Don't even.  He panicked, so we...  So we didn't do it, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Sure.  It never happened.  It never happened, and it was never caught on video and still pictures and everything.  That will be up on foundrymusic.com later tonight.  So this is how it went down from Mardi Gras.  All right.  Here's the Hummer check.  Hey, how you doing?  Hummer queen. 
[01:56:00]  Hey, who's your friend with the big boobs?  My friend Steffi.  Steffi?  Yep.  Do we get to see those?  Yeah.  Yeah, I got it.  Wow, look at that.  Wow.  Did you give any BJs today?  I have not given a single BJ yet today.  So I guess you're just yearning to get a little C in your mouth.  I'm just waiting for it, you know?  Yeah, who is it?  Norton, right?  Well, you know, normally you don't want to do it before 12.  That'd be slutty.  Heaven forbid.  I got to ask Oasis, how many Hummers are you going for today?  For today?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't set a limit. 
[01:56:30]  I just take all of them I can get.  Well, what do you think?  Are you good for 10 today?  Oh, I'm good for more than 10.  More than 10.  You'd be yearning, yearning for a little bit of man junk today.  Right?  You've got to be.  Would you go down there and do it right now?  I would not go down there in the street and do it, no.  No?  But up here you would, right?  All down the street.  What about if we get a little corner over here and get a lucky listener?  Yeah, I would do that.  Wow, how about that? 
[01:57:00]  Hey, Rick, get Rick over here.  All right, Rick, you know what's going on?  It's so loud, I don't even know who can hear us.  You see this balcony over here?  Oasis is willing to give one of our listeners a hummer right now on the balcony while thousands of people watch.  You think you can go down there and find one lucky guy?  Yeah, sure.  Hey, Rick, we found a guy?  Let me ask you, this was not the thing I wanted to be walking around the street, asking guys if they wanted a hummer.  Wow.  The right bad idea. 
[01:57:30]  But I found Gary here from Baltimore.  You're from Baltimore, huh?  Baltimore, yeah.  You listen to the O&A show?  No, I never have.  That's Washington, you know.  Oh, man, I don't know if we should, we've got to give it to a listener.  You know, I talked to a few listeners down there and they were like, they looked up at her and they went, nah, nah, no.  Wow.  Yeah.  What, a bunch of faggots?  Well, why don't we take care of the guy anyway?  That's okay.  All right, we'll do that.  Let's go back out to the balcony.  Bring Oasis over first for the little meet and greet.  Oasis, come here.  We found a guy.  Is this guy suitable? 
[01:58:00]  This guy's suitable?  Sure.  Yeah, would you like to accept some oral treats from her?  That's the biggest challenge, though.  I'll tell you right now, the biggest challenge is for you.  Sure, okay.  Because you've got to be able to get in front of other people.  Ah, he's fun.  And that's hard.  That's hard.  I know.  A lot of people can't do it.  I know.  All right, don't jinx him.  Go ahead, just...  All right, let's go out to a...  It may not be the pressure of the crowd, Oasis.  For a certain part, if you would follow Oasis over to this side, go ahead.  Jim's like saying, no, no, no, don't do this outside. 
[01:58:30]  What are you kidding?  We share everything with our listeners.  You have to.  All right, here we go.  All right, Gary's from the Baltimore area.  Didn't this guy use to murder gay guys and eat them?  Anything.  Now, you know, just go to town.  Dude, here it is, your moment.  Check this out.  And she's going to do what she does.  Don't block my view, Ant.  All right, we got...  Excuse me, paparazzi.  Could you move back?  I want to see the Hummer happening.  They're trying to figure out the logistics of this thing.  Can they go over the rope and get in the clear over there?  All you need is the m*** in the mouth. 
[01:59:00]  This is not difficult to figure out.  You guys can go over the ropes.  Uh-oh, the girl is down on her knees, Anthony.  Here we go.  We're not going to be able to explain too much of this.  You guys, check this out.  What happened?  We're cut off.  What's wrong, Tom?  Get Tom over here.  Hey, what's the problem?  What's the problem?  They're shouting on your knees.  We're creating quite a problem right now.  What's the problem, Rick?  What happened, Rick?  Let's just say this isn't legal. 
[01:59:30]  Why not?  Oh, I don't know.  Talk to the officials.  They're shutting us down, Ant.  They're shutting us down.  Jesus Christ, man.  And the whole crowd is saying, on your knees.  We got probably 5,000 people in front of us right now.  I think Tom's upset because there are no drugs involved.  Oh, man.  What happened?  Who pulled the plug?  Who pulled the plug?  Who is pulling the plug?  Who's pulling the plug?  Put it this way. 
[02:00:00]  I'm sure I'm going to be putting this fire out forever.  You know, you've got to learn this is what you've got to deal with, Tom, with the O&A show.  Right.  This is, you know, it was about how Tom's shown responsibility, Anthony.  As far as putting out fires, our own Ken Stevens back at NEW in New York, he actually walks around in a fireman's uniform.  Because he has had to put out so many fires from this program.  Um, geez.  Well, we're going to have to work something out.  What are you guys hearing? 
[02:00:30]  We're just getting a word from Tom, and Tom, what a great, uh...  Just like Tom said, there will be no Hummers...  No, no, we have to stop.  ...on the balcony of, uh, of, uh, Bourbon Street, Anthony.  We have to stop.  I don't know why there's 10,000 people in front of us.  There's a balcony as we face Bourbon Street, Anthony.  Absolutely none.  Because we understand authority.  Tom, why are the beads flying?  I don't know why the beads are flying, Tom. 
[02:01:00]  Thank you for cooperating.  No problem.  We cooperated, and, uh...  Right.  And we respect your authority.  And you cannot see those pictures anyway.  That's right.  All right.  Look at the guys that look like congressmen walking through.  I know.  What the hell is that all about?  But, God, what they just saw.  Or didn't see, Opie.  That's right.  It never happened, right, Tom?  Not even happening.  Don't worry, Tom.  I'm doing fun, man.  How you guys doing?  All right.  Tom, I would say have another drink.  This guy's a pisser. 
[02:01:30]  Okay.  Well, we got Oasis hanging with us.  She gives out Hummers.  And, uh, I guess we could take another break here, huh?  Yeah, I think we got to do a few commercials, but, uh, we'll be back with more jabot.  Can I see your taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Taint?  Nice.  Between the peach and the balloon knot.  Can we see your butt?  Nice.  I would have to just blank on your chin.  Does this guy know how to party or what?  Okay, terrific.  Terrific. 
[02:02:00]  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  We have a special guest in the studio that doesn't want to talk.  I'll tell you this much.  Frenchie in the studio, and I've never seen more quiet in my life.  That'll happen.  I am missing my pants.  God damn it.  Keep your mouth shut.  I'll make you ask.  Steve Garland, Anthony, on the line.  The program director of KSOA.  The city of supermodels.  Hey, Oda.  A lot of people accusing you of going to a model agency for the contestants in the Naughty 
[02:02:30]  Nighty contest.  You know, I come back and deny and deny over again.  Nobody has called an agency here.  You know what it is?  It's the male hormones of your show manifesting itself with gorgeous, gorgeous, available young  women that want to be a part of the Naughty Nighty contest.  Well, Steve, just when we thought the girls couldn't get any hotter, maybe you run out  of supermodels to put in front of your cameras there in Sacramento. 
[02:03:00]  We get back, and we see contestant 93, Daniela.  Daniela.  So I click, because I see Sacramento, and I go, maybe this is going to be one that's  more like a real girl that we see just wandering the streets.  Again, Daniela from Sacramento.  A goddamn supermodel.  They're incredible.  A beautiful girl.  You know, I hate my job.  Hey, dude, even if you did go to a modeling agency, good for you, because some of the  cities went to fat twats with C-sections Incorporated and hired girls, so nice move. 
[02:03:30]  Hey, I worked with agencies in San Francisco in the old days, you know, jumping for food,  and I didn't see this many good-looking women at any agency.  You know, a lot of guys now calling up saying we should have a second contest to win the  right to lick the conference table at KXOX, where all these girls are taking their pictures.  There is the last picture of the second outfit that Daniela's...  Oh, let's go to that right now.  Look at this. 
[02:04:00]  That's number 93 on your scorecard.  That is an unbelievable shot right there.  That's so hot.  Yeah, second outfit.  And she's got the lighting again, perfect.  She's got this flame-like lighting on her chest.  Yeah, you know, Daniela took it upon herself to hunt me down on Friday and find out if there  was any way that she could talk to you guys.  We have her cell phone number here.  Would you like me to get her on the show?  Are you insane?  Of course.  Yeah, of course.  Well, I knew that was a question that had its own answer. 
[02:04:30]  All right, let us get her so that you can find out exactly what she's all about.  Yeah, yeah.  Daniela said she is hot for you guys, hot for the show, and she said, I know I'm a late  entrant, but if they just go to the pictures, they will vote.  How old was Daniela?  Daniela looked to me like mid-twenties.  Yeah.  In regular lighting.  And, you know, she said, oh, I'm sorry, I look like crap today.  Of course, all the men were fainting down the aisle.  Oh, yeah.  What crap?  I look awful today. 
[02:05:00]  I'm sorry.  Where?  Yeah, isn't that terrible?  No, she does not need any lighting to look gorgeous.  I think all the KXA girls, really, there is one ugly one, though.  She is not up on the website.  You go ask your marketing director for the pictures that have not been put up there of  Shai.  Why?  What happened?  She didn't fit the supermodel look?  She does not fit the supermodel look.  Are they actually, wait a minute, you guys are pulling back some of your contestants?  No, we sent it. 
[02:05:30]  It's not up on the way.  Yeah, because if you remember, we told him to find two ugly girls from Sacramento.  And that has been my goal.  There is one that I swear to God, you know, I think a dog would choose a chair over Shai.  Really?  That's a nice policy.  If they don't have blonde hair and blue eyes, just execute them.  Why not?  Well, Danielle has the brunette thing working.  Yeah.  We send them out to do personal.  The ugly ones, we send them out to do personal appearances for the other stations.  Very good.  Ah, good idea.  All right, Steve.  All right, so check it out. 
[02:06:00]  Ask your marketing director for Shai, because I had to find at least one ugly dog for you.  But all the real entrants, gorgeous.  Yeah.  Well, make sure everyone votes out there in Sacramento.  Hey, one quick question for you guys.  The voting has been gone, yes.  Yeah.  Now, you said you can only vote once a day.  Are the computers locked on so the people are locked out if they're trying to stuff the ballot box here?  It'll tell them that they actually voted again, but it doesn't work.  Yeah.  They're not voting.  It uploads a virus to their computer. 
[02:06:30]  No.  We have a pro that's on the job, so.  Yeah, dude, you can't spend all day just stuffing the box.  No, but you can't spend all day going through the website.  Yes, you can.  Kid Chris's research for his show tonight, extra plug, ding.  Oh, thank you, Steve.  He's just checking out the O&A website, guys.  All right, Garland.  Thanks a lot.  We'll talk to you soon.  All right, bye-bye.  There you go.  Sacramento checking in.  Who is that?  Somebody's saying Friday's show.  Let's see.  God, I've got to find it. 
[02:07:00]  Friday's show sounded like a play-by-play of your mother getting gang-banged.  Wow.  That's not true.  Friday's show didn't make me want to whack my bag.  Contestant number 71 just wants to say hi, Anthony.  Oh, Jamie.  Jamie, what's up?  Punch that up.  Hi.  Just want to say hello.  Let's punch up number 71, everyone.  Let me get the visual.  Do you have a visual?  No.  Oh, I remember her before I even put it down because I see.  Turn around a little bit.  Oh, my God.  I need a visual.  Oh, cowgirl. 
[02:07:30]  I'm going right to the cowgirl outfit.  Wow.  You have an amazing hiney.  Can I tell you that?  Oh, thank you.  All the cornbread.  I'm from Alabama, so, you know.  We have too many contestants.  I almost forgot about contestant number 71, the cowgirl outfit.  Beautiful.  Representing Washington.  Exactly.  I'd be more than happy to take a little solid discipline  on my chest.  Okay.  Notice how I say solid.  Believe me, you're going to get a lot of votes there, Jamie.  Oh, I hope so.  Yes.  I like the way.  She is completely naked in the last shot. 
[02:08:00]  She's got her hands against the wall.  She's on her knees.  And then the other one, she's sitting on a console,  and she's just, she's completely naked,  but she's draping the nightie.  Yeah.  I was still looking so too much.  Jamie, let me tell you this much.  We have a special guest in the studio  that doesn't want to go on mic,  and he's starting to say things in the background  because he's checking out your pictures.  You may hear from the background now going,  like that?  Oh, really?  That's all he's saying. 
[02:08:30]  No, I can't hear.  All right.  Well, thanks for checking in, Jamie.  Sure.  You a married gal, are you?  Yes, yes, but I desperately need to go.  I have 30 friends who are going in April.  We're a group of swingers.  Oh, a group of swingers going to a hedonism, right?  Mm-hmm.  Hedonism 3?  Are you a swinger?  Yeah.  So you're married, but you swing?  Mm-hmm.  And then, wow, who the hell gets to bang you  at a swing party?  I'm pretty selective.  Somebody with a hot wife  because her husband's not going to give her up 
[02:09:00]  for some guy with a family.  Now, what's your husband?  Do you just sit there and watch your husband  bang other girls?  Oh, no, I'm busy.  So you're getting slammed by guys,  and your husband's off somewhere else  banging other girls?  Usually girls.  Oh, you're with girls.  Aren't most of the couples, like, just pigs?  Slobs?  No, not my friends, no.  So all your friends get together  and just have these big sex parties?  Every now and then, yeah.  All right, well.  Super Bowl weekend and...  I do believe the fact that you're a swinger 
[02:09:30]  is going to help your vote.  That's pretty good.  Well, I hope so.  People just got an image.  If any of the other contestants want to call in  with something that we don't know about you,  feel free.  Jamie, sure.  Contestant number 71 is a swinger.  Yeah, sure.  I'll send you guys pics.  We would love to see you pics.  Oh, swinger pics.  There you go.  All righty.  Thank you.  Send him a nice mouthful of helmet.  There goes Jamie the swinger.  Jasmine, what's up?  Jasmine.  Hey.  Speak.  Jasmine.  Hello, how are you? 
[02:10:00]  How are you?  I'm before.  What's up, Jasmine?  I'm fine.  I'm contestant number 81.  All right.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Let me punch that up.  81.  Jasmine, here it is.  Oh, yeah.  Damn it.  I can't get this up, baby.  You're as dark as Booker T.  I don't know why I would say something like that.  Contestant number 81.  You tool, man.  Hey, you know what?  I'm so, oh, my God. 
[02:10:30]  That's just so bad.  Jasmine.  Goddamn computer socks.  Jasmine, let me tell you something.  I'm liking it.  Dude.  Liking it.  This was the girl that showed up on Thursday when you guys were at the airport.  You know, I think there's a lot of contestants that haven't seen their pictures because this  is like the third girl that we've seen while on the air that I, you know, I didn't  even know she was in the contest.  And she's single.  You're single, Jasmine?  Yes, I am.  Tell us a little bit about you.  Well, I'm 24 years old and I'm 24 years old. 
[02:11:00]  I go to college.  I'm in Napa.  I go for business management.  Yeah.  Learn some of that business.  Hey.  I miss you guys in an hour.  So you can get your own benefits.  Yeah.  How do you?  Is that my third picture?  I don't need no man.  What, Jasmine?  You saw my third, the third one?  The third picture?  I've seen them all and you're a fine African princess.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, baby.  Would you ever date a white guy who's out of shape with erectile dysfunction? 
[02:11:30]  I date all types of guys.  Oh, you do, huh?  Yeah.  I love, I love white men.  Oh, you like that, huh?  Well, I love, I love the junks.  Oh, yeah.  What do you like about the white guy junk?  That's different than...  It feels so good.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow.  And you rock.  All right.  Look at that.  I'm voting for Jasmine.  Yes.  What the hell?  You like the contrast of the white on black? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  You look like that?  No, me, me, me.  The alabaster pole?  You guys bad.  You're so bad.  I think a batch would look very nice on a set of black breasts, don't you?  Any breasts.  Nice white batch all over her.  A batch looks good on a mastectomy scar.  Oh, God.  Are you kidding?  There's nowhere a batch doesn't look good.  That almost got our special guest laughing out loud.  Oh, God.  He's trying to hold back his laugh.  Oh, did I say he?  I can go upstairs. 
[02:12:30]  I love you.  All right, Jasmine.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you so much for taking my call.  Yeah, good luck.  No, the thing about it is I heard over the radio that you said that you were not going  to vote for any New York girl.  Why is that?  Oh, no.  Jasmine, I did say that, but I didn't even know you were in the contest until just now.  Oh, okay.  I got to rethink my voting strategy.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  All right, Jasmine.  Okay, bye-bye.  She's beautiful.  Thank you.  Bye.  Let's go to Jamie from Boston.  Jamie, what's up? 
[02:13:00]  Hey, what's going on, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good.  Hey, I just wanted to call because you guys were giving Boston a rap, you know, earlier  about not having any contestants.  Now, look at that.  What is it?  93 and 94, I think.  You guys came on strong in the end.  I'm telling you.  Oh, those two.  Those last two, though.  They are beautiful.  I don't know if you've seen them yet.  I didn't hear you talking about them.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Wow, look at that.  Yeah, those are definitely finalists, I think.  All right.  Hey, you guys suck.  Thank you.  Another one of our contestants checking in. 
[02:13:30]  Kitty, contestant number.  What number?  What number are you, Kitty?  I cannot remember what.  It's 80-something.  Go down.  Let's look.  Let's look.  Go down, special guest using my computer.  80-something.  What's your name?  Oh, Kitty.  Are you representing Washington?  Yes, sir.  Hey, no.  Oh, yeah.  And you got a friend with you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had a friend help you with the pictures?  Yeah.  Which one are you?  Are you the one in the white or the red outfit before you're completely naked?  Oh, very nice. 
[02:14:00]  And who's your friend?  That's Rachel, actually.  Yeah.  My name is Sherry, actually.  Sherry.  Anything special you want to tell our listeners about yourself?  Not really.  Just mainly me and her used to mess around a little bit.  You used to bump donuts?  Yeah, pretty much.  Bump and ugly.  All right.  Okay.  Well, you guys have a wonderful day.  Thanks, Kitty.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Funny.  After those two hang out, their faces smell like a Cajun restaurant. 
[02:14:30]  Tony wants to compliment Norton on his line of his life.  Tony, what's up?  Hey, Mr. Norton.  Yes, sir.  The batch on the vasectomy scar line of your life, sir.  Thank you, man.  Very brilliant.  Vasectomy.  Yeah.  He said vasectomy.  Did he say vasectomy scar?  No, he said...  Oh, well, he knew what I meant.  I know.  I hope he does.  Well, thank you, man.  That one felt good coming out.  Sometimes you say something, and you're just like, wow, it's good to be me at this one. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to tell you guys who's in the studio.  All right.  Is it Voss?  No, it's not Voss.  No.  It's not Voss.  We said special.  And comic.  Adam Farah.  No.  No, Adam would jump right on the mic.  Of course.  I don't know.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Another contestant checking in.  Or maybe not.  What's up? 
[02:15:30]  Hello?  Yeah, who are you?  This is contestant number 21.  All right.  Turn around and let's see contestant number 21.  Let me go to 21.  I'm trying to get up here now.  This is going to give me more votes, but I love wrestling alligators.  Oh, yeah?  Well, we can't confirm that this is contestant number 21.  No, of course not.  Maybe she has a sore throat or something.  All right. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you, contestant number 21.  You should see my feces.  It's full of cornstarch.  Very good.  I want to do solid discipline on Norton's face.  There she is.  All right.  I'm sorry.  Here comes the poor man.  I got to go back to my construction job.  Goodbye, boy.  Thank you, number 21.  I could picture her more doing solid discipline on the streets than Mardi Gras. 
[02:16:30]  Pete, what's going on?  Yo.  Hey.  How's it going?  Good.  Is that Brewer that's in the studio?  Oh, Brewer.  Brewer would jump on mic with us as well.  No, it's not Brewer.  It's not Brewer.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Hey, if they guess who the special guest is, will the special guest say hi at least today?  Oh, all right.  He's nodding yes, Anthony.  I saw that.  All right.  All right.  Now all the contestants are checking in. 
[02:17:00]  Why don't we take a quick break and we'll talk to some of the contestants.  That'll be good.  That could be a lot of fun.  Oh, well, look.  See?  Look, Melanie's checking in saying why not vote for New York Chick.  Melanie would be in my top five.  I put her in my top five.  Gene Melanie, contestant number three.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi.  I heard you're not voting for anybody in New York.  No, that's not true.  We're just kind of throwing it out there.  We're just hoping people vote for what they think is the highest chick, no matter what  city they're from.  That's what we're getting at. 
[02:17:30]  That makes sense.  Ant said you're one of his top five.  I'd put you in the top five.  Oh, thank you.  Her little teen ass.  Look at that.  How old, special guest?  She's 18.  I'm 19.  19.  I'm sorry, 19.  I'm sorry.  Now you just went back to top ten.  You lost a few votes by saying 19.  I'm barely 19.  How about that?  Well, a special guest wants to know if you're shaved.  Very.  Very.  Oh, see?  All of a sudden, it's getting better, right? 
[02:18:00]  Right, special guest?  I'll bet those little logs smell like cotton candy.  Just hold one under your nose.  Melanie, anything special you want to tell the voters?  Because the voting has begun.  Yeah.  Basically, anybody who knows me.  There's a lot of them out there.  Vote for me.  Vote a lot for me.  But, I mean, anything special about you?  I mean...  Anything special about me?  I am a single girl.  Single girl, all right.  Single girl who likes to get freaky with lots of different kinds of things.  All right.  You just got a few extra votes. 
[02:18:30]  Hey.  Thank you, Melanie.  Oh, thank you.  All right.  Thanks.  Why don't we go to break with a little ditty before the commercials?  Sure.  A little ditty.  A ditty?  A little ditty about Afghanistan.  If tomorrow all my things were gone, like my handguns and my knives. 
[02:19:00]  And I had to flee to Pakistan with just my children and my wives.  I wish my lucky stars, that we'd never bomb the coal.  That we'd hunt it down, that we'd hunt it down, that we'd hunt it down, that we'd hunt it down, and we'd smoke him from his hole.  And I'm not scared to live in Afghanistan, where I drink my car, and I fight with Russian weapons. 
[02:19:30]  Made in 1963, so put your hands up, kneel down, throw your guns away, cause there ain't no chance the Taliban can beat the USA.  From the caves of South Afghanistan, to the Middle Eastern Seas, from across the plains of Kazakhstan, you'll hear our knocking knees. 
[02:20:00]  From Kabul to East, and in the Khyber Pass, you'll hear us all crap in our pants, as the U.S. kicks our ass.  And I'm scared to live in Afghanistan, where I drink my car, and I fight with Russian weapons. 
[02:20:30]  Made in 1963, so put your hands up, kneel down, throw your guns away, cause there ain't no chance the Taliban can beat the USA. 
[02:21:00]  Is this a brand of humor you can appreciate?  All right, let me get a little saucy here.  For the love of Eve, you bet.  Life serves you up lemons, you make lemonade.  We're a little out of control here.  Stop cracking lies.  Um, not this past week, but the week before that.  Totaled my van, on the way up there, so I didn't get my pictures taken.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  So I went back, last Thursday, to get a reshoot, and because it was after five, they kicked me out of the studio.  What?  So I went back up on Friday, and actually got the reshoot, but my new pictures aren't up. 
[02:21:30]  We sent you like 12 pictures.  They're working on it.  Oh, okay.  But I think the ones that represent you, that are up there, are pretty nice.  Yeah.  Nice red outfit.  Yeah, thanks.  Plus, Valentine's Day right around the corner, that might help you out a little bit.  Ha ha ha.  All right, well, I just wondered why they weren't up, cause I have been through so much crap to get them up.  All right, uh, yeah, he's working on them.  Okay.  All right?  All right, thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  What about a cross-section of this fine nation?  Let's go to Jay.  Just looking at all the different cities, and how different the girls are from all the different cities. 
[02:22:00]  I'm taking the African princess that came up here Thursday when we were in New Orleans.  Which picture is that?  The girl we just talked to, Jasmine, a little while ago.  Jay.  What number?  My computer was broke.  81.  Uh, Jay.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up, bro?  Yeah.  Hey.  Dude, I am so pissed at the way Cleveland represented.  These chicks are so hit.  I don't know.  You got some nice ones up there.  The girl we just talked to is kind of nice.  Uh, number 42 is nice. 
[02:22:30]  You're not taking Cleveland.  Uh, the ass still at work.  Sitting in an instant feedback.  Dude, I keep going to head on lettuce.  These chicks are so ugly.  All right, bro.  Thanks, Jay.  Hey, all right.  This guy on the instant feedback writes, I think Cleveland's digital camera is older than  Rich Voss' material.  Oh.  Rich isn't even here to defend himself.  Come on now.  Stop.  And, dude, that's not even true.  Cleveland had some pretty good looking girls.  Go to number 42.  Really sexy.  Contestant number 42.  Cindy, contestant number 40.  40.  What's going on, Cindy?  Hey, they need to stop bragging on Cleveland. 
[02:23:00]  We represented really well.  This is Sin.  That's right.  Sin.  S-I-N-D.  Hey, you're pretty nice there.  Hey, thanks.  Anything special you want to tell the voters?  I love F.O.S.  Oh, yeah.  You love F.O.S. in Cleveland?  I love F.O.S. in Cleveland.  That's all I have to say.  That's a nice shot of you with just whipped cream on.  Yeah, F.O.S. was there for that one.  Very nice.  Yeah.  Well, good luck in the contest.  Well, thanks. 
[02:23:30]  All right.  Bye.  Miss?  Miss?  Yeah?  Did you ever give F.O.S. a little?  No.  Well, why don't you stop and start being a trooper and go down there and drink out of his mule?  Yeah, take one for the team already.  Something about you.  Think about him.  I think he's too chicken.  He's not chicken.  Believe it or not.  He's chicken.  Are you married, Cindy?  No, I'm not married.  All right.  I think I'm older than any one of the girls out of Cleveland.  How old are you?  How old are you?  A lot of guys like old women.  You look a little bit on the older side. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, I'm older.  How old are you?  How old are you?  Old enough not to tell you my age.  No, it's actually because it makes you different from the other contestants.  You've got to have something different.  Ah, 32 years old.  You guys cheat.  That's not old.  Huh?  You guys cheated.  Why?  You shouldn't tell people how old I am.  How would I know how old are you?  Did I hit nail it?  You nailed it.  Could you see her taint from the picture, Opie?  Were you able to see her taint?  Well, there was a couple of leftover shots that I was able to check out real fast. 
[02:24:30]  I will also say number 19 from Cleveland.  Very attractive.  Hey!  I'm just saying.  A lot of people bashing Cleveland.  Yes, she's a cutie.  Cleveland's got cuties coming out.  You just got to fumble through them.  Hey, it looks like...  Do you have the red eyes, too?  Yeah, all the girls from Cleveland have the red double eyes, though.  Because it works from Cleveland.  All right.  Well, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks, Sin.  All right.  Talk to you soon.  Bye.  Nailed it.  32.  Harry, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I want to say, number 94, how many miles above sea level do you think her mountains are, man? 
[02:25:00]  How many miles can she stick in between them things?  I think we've gone there before.  She's the one with the...  From Philly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  She's got huge, natural boobies.  In the last picture, she's serving up a heap and helping.  Yeah, she is, man.  Of breast meat.  Yeah, someone else is commenting about 94.  Halfro.  What are you twats crazy?  You're not giving contestant number 94 her props.  She's the most natural chick on there.  She's banging with those huge breasts. 
[02:25:30]  Nice.  I'm starting to think you guys don't have a mule or yam bag.  You told.  Would you stop it?  Number 94 all the way.  Oh, man.  All right, Harry.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  You suck.  All right.  More contestants checking in.  We got Lexus number 18.  All right.  Hi, guys.  It's Lexus from Hot Body.  Hot Body?  Philly.  Yeah, Hot Body International.  I give you my video.  Oh, wow.  I remember you.  Did you watch it?  Yeah.  Of course we did.  Well, I'll bring you a new one.  All right. 
[02:26:00]  So what do you want...  I got a new one for you.  What do you want to tell the voters?  Well, actually, I want you guys to do me a little bit of a favor.  What's that?  I want you to pick out some hot girls for me that, like, they've never been with a girl before.  Oh, yeah.  I'll come on the show, and I'll have sex with them in the studio.  Cool.  You'll just have sex with five of the other contestants?  No, I'll pick one.  Oh, you'll pick one?  It doesn't need to be one of the contestants.  It can be any hot girl.  Well, hold on the line.  I think we can get you up to New York for this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I think we can do that. 
[02:26:30]  All right.  And, Lexus, would you do us a favor?  What?  With one of the guys in the studio?  For you?  I didn't mean me.  Now he does.  Well, I already know what you got, Norton.  I was on your lap, remember?  Oh.  All right.  Well, there goes that idea.  You can feel those shankers right through the pants?  It was wonderful.  Oh, my God.  Why do you think I stayed there for like an hour and a half?  Feel all the bumps.  I know.  He's gone.  I just assumed you meant a disease or something. 
[02:27:00]  All right, Lexus.  Thank you.  Hold on the line, all right?  Okay.  Do we have her info?  She wants to come up and have sex with somebody.  But you've got to pick me four girls, and then I'll pick one of them.  Speaking of having sex, what's happening with Keisha and her virginity?  Is that going down this week?  I can never get a hold of her on Friday from New Orleans.  Oh, boy.  All right.  We'll figure that out tomorrow, right?  We'll try and get that situation awaited.  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  Virgin.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Come on.  Valentine's Day, virgin. 
[02:27:30]  Alexis.  Yo, what's up?  Hey, this Alexis doesn't want to do any whores, but I just wanted to say,  I was online.  Yo, these Cleveland chicks look like Drew Carey in 90s.  Nafety.  Yo, thank God none of these Southern Jersey bitches went on there.  See some mullets up in there, some NASCAR tattoos.  Thank God Jersey stayed quiet, bro.  Huh?  I don't want to see one of them.  I live in Newark, yo.  I want to see, like, some of these ghetto gangster bitches up in there  all talking about, like, yo, let me get a baby daddy on ONA. 
[02:28:00]  Yo, Norton, your God.  And I went to see Brian Regan last night, funny as a mother effer.  Oh, yeah, Regan's great.  At Bananas.  Did he have a good crowd?  Did he have a good crowd?  Oh, my God.  The place was going crazy.  Dude, I sat, like, three feet away from him.  He spits like a mother effer, though.  Well, he's high energy when he's on that stage, so.  Jesus Christ, man.  I thought he had, like, Miracle Girl coming out of his mouth.  He's one of the funniest guys out there.  Hilarious.  He is the funniest.  Kills every time he comes to town, so.  Oh, my God. 
[02:28:30]  But, yo, his haircut's older than Voss's material.  Good.  All right, Alexis.  Oh, perhaps I ought to get a new hairstylist.  Alexis is firing him off today.  Kenny.  Hey, ONA.  Hey, Norton.  What's up?  Hey, sorry, I missed Booker.  So, uh.  It wasn't Booker.  All right, there you go.  Opie, how do you do it?  How do you guess these ages from the tank?  I got to know.  Hold on.  Time out.  One of my favorite chicks, Anna, contestant number 72.  When did she start, when did she do all the topless shots? 
[02:29:00]  Ooh.  Were these just added?  72, Anna.  Let me see, let me see.  I think Anna got a little nervous because we started talking about the other girls, and  now there are pictures of her.  She's topless, but she's not really showing the boobs, but it doesn't matter.  It just makes it that much hotter.  There's a shot of her leaning against the wall with her ass facing the camera.  She's got her head turned around.  Another one where she's crawling on the table.  And then one where she's holding her beautiful breasts, kneeling on the table.  These have to be brand new shots that we just put up. 
[02:29:30]  She is, boy, a California looking girl.  Hey, did they, they didn't get rid of other shots to put those up, did they?  No.  Oh, okay.  No, the original ones are right there.  And now they got new ones, Anna.  Don't you just look at those pictures and she's so attractive, you just want to take scissors  and drive them into your own stomach?  I was thinking the same thing, Norton.  So what's up, Kenny?  So how do you do it?  You got to give some hints.  What?  Subtle hints on how you look at the paint and you just know the eight. 
[02:30:00]  I've never.  There's got to be something there.  I've never been wrong.  These guys have checked it out.  He won't even tell me, and I spend a lot of time with him, and I have asked him because  it's a great trick to pull on a girl.  Like, I'll bet you I can guess if you do this.  And he won't even tell me.  Yeah.  No, it's one of my things.  It's a talent.  I don't know.  Do they have to be naked, or can they be wearing like a G-string, or do they have to be naked?  No, he needs to really get a good look at the taint.  It's just one of my things I bring to the show.  That's all.  I don't want to give it away.  Then I'll have one less thing.  Did you use to practice at home or something? 
[02:30:30]  I mean, how did you learn this stuff?  I practiced it with my grandma.  In between tongue kissing.  All right.  All right.  That's fine.  That's sick.  All right.  Thank you.  You guys rule.  Bye.  You heard that one, Norton, right?  Where L.P. slipped his grandmother the tongue one day?  It's by accident.  I didn't know I was young.  What do you mean you didn't know?  I did not know.  This is the best part.  Yeah.  I was like eight or something.  I went to give her a kiss, and I had my tongue out.  She said, put your tongue back in your mouth.  What a creep.  I don't think I actually...  When your grandmother has to go, put your tongue back in your mouth before I kiss you. 
[02:31:00]  Whatever.  I learned.  George.  Little Greg trying to get some.  Yo.  What's up, George?  What up?  Why isn't anyone ever talking about number 20 from Philly?  All right.  Then, let's look.  Oh, that's teen Rhiannon, and she's on the phone.  Hold on.  We like teen Rhiannon.  Oh, my gosh.  I want to marry her.  Look, the last one.  Rhiannon.  Hello?  George loves you.  George loves me?  George is on the line, and he loves you.  Thank you, George.  We're ready to marry you in two seconds.  He was just saying some really nasty things about you. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  I've been listening.  Oh, okay.  I didn't say anything bad.  Yeah, that's a...  I'm very honored, though.  That's very nice.  I was going to say that, you know, not a lot of people have been calling in and talking  about the earlier girls who kind of started the whole contest off, you know?  It's just so hard because there's so many.  Oh, I know, and they're all beautiful, and I remember when I went to Philly last Friday  that there were probably only maybe 12 girls. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Like, you know, when I went there two weeks ago, just two weeks ago.  I was 98, and, you know, I picked my top five faves, and then I'm looking at all the  pictures going, but how am I going to...  Right.  How am I going to get her in the top five?  The girls are absolutely gorgeous.  They really are.  Rhiannon, my favorite picture is number three.  See, let me tell you something.  I'm Latin.  I'm Hispanic.  Oh, I am, too.  Oh, you want to grab that ass, don't you?  You want that ass.  Oh, my goodness.  I got to say, the fourth and fifth picture is very batch worthy. 
[02:32:30]  I have to tell you guys, a lot happened to me since I went and got those pictures.  Uh-oh.  You didn't have a car wreck, did you?  Not...  No.  Well, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not, uh, it's not that bad, but...  Someone's fault.  No, basically, I'm not really living, um, in my house anymore.  What happened?  Well, you know, Mom and Dad found out, and, you know...  You're posing in a bathing suit.  You're in a bathing suit.  I know, I know.  It's not even really a naughty-nighty.  I know.  Tell your parents to get a hold of themselves. 
[02:33:00]  How old are you?  I'm 18.  You're 18.  Perfect.  Yeah.  Hey, this guy will take in and kill you.  I am 18, indeed.  And also, by the way, by the way...  Yeah.  There's somebody in your studio that I'm very fond of.  Uh-oh, are you pregnant?  I'm very upset because, um, you know, I'm not even going to go into it, but, uh, they  know who they are.  All right.  Who?  Who?  You all know who it is.  Rick?  It's Rick.  Yeah.  No, no.  It's not Rick.  I'm not going to embarrass the person.  And then... 
[02:33:30]  But I offered them, I told them, I said, I said, um, you know, I'll...  Because I'm a virgin.  Uh-huh.  I said, I'd like to lose my virginity to you, and...  You didn't put it that way.  Like, oh, damn.  Yes, I did.  Well, I said deflowered.  I said deflowered.  I said deflowered.  So, same thing.  So, you offered your virginity to somebody...  To me.  Oh, it was to Opie.  Right.  Oh, okay, Opie.  Go ahead and just throw it up.  I was going to, you know, I was going to embarrass you or anything.  Oh, what happened, Opie?  What happened?  What happened?  What happened?  And I told him, and I said, I said... 
[02:34:00]  All your...  What?  The...  What's her name?  The one that won the best ass contest.  Everyone said it.  Right.  I was actually living with her for a while.  Because I had nowhere to go.  We got to go.  We got to go.  Thank you.  Man, what did you take...  Wow.  Why don't you give your virginity to the Spanish guy on the line?  That was a quick little escape from that phone call.  Believe me.  Dude, who wants for...  Look, nothing personal against virgins.  God bless you.  But you have a sex with a virgin.  It's like, oh, ow, ow, ooh.  You know, it's...  Oh, I... 
[02:34:30]  Do you love me?  Oh, stupid.  I don't...  A little chloroform stops that.  All that bitching there.  You don't have to drag them across the floor if that happens.  But...  I like dirty girls.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hi, I'm Robin, number 57.  I want to know if Norton would do me.  All right, let me punch up your pictures.  Let me look first.  I was going to call earlier, but I ripped the phone out of the wall, and I had to go  get a new one.  If I win, I guarantee you that I will let everybody come to my drive-in movie theater 
[02:35:00]  on my back.  Wow.  There's contestant number 57.  Norton, please give me golden discipline.  And this, I would do you, actually.  I've seen the photos.  I helped tie the corset, and yeah, I would.  You are so hot.  I want to do you.  I'm punching out now, Maverick.  All right, bye.  He sounds like the guy that does my commercials.  Jim Norton.  He's banging off.  Let's go to Paul.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Just looking at the list of the girls, I was on there last night, and I made up a list 
[02:35:30]  of, like, five, and then I went back and looked at more, and then there's five more.  Why don't we do this?  Why don't we, like, break them out by the cities, like, on the website?  Yeah, it's too late for that.  Yeah, it's too late for that.  And then, like, now it does.  I take the top two girls from each city, and then narrow it down that way.  It makes it a little bit easier.  Paul, wait, there are more reshoot pictures up on opianthony.com.  For whom?  For another three hours online, and I'd be confused again.  Go to contestant number 69.  Paul, this is what we came up with, because it was getting, you know, we didn't want it 
[02:36:00]  too complicated.  So, the next, wow.  Dude, I can't talk to you anymore, because there are reshoot pictures up that are just  ridiculous.  I'd be home in, I'm on the Garden State Park right now, I'd be home in 20 minutes, I'd  be on the computer.  All right, uh, the contestant number 69, her reshoot pictures are up.  Of course, she's from Sacramento, Anthony.  Just when you thought her pictures could not get hotter.  Oh.  Go, go to, wait a minute, they're all hot.  Look at that, one, two, three, four.  Look at the fourth picture down. 
[02:36:30]  Fourth and five.  And five, where she's laid out on the table.  This is ridiculous now.  Give me a break.  Don't you love when a little lip just pokes out and says, hello?  Hey, how's it doing?  You can almost hear it going, hey?  Hey, hey.  Someone got this thong off of me, see?  What about the see-through outfit?  The orange see-through top.  Amazing.  Look at the, what the hell is, what, who the, look at that, she's got one lovely breast 
[02:37:00]  uncovered.  The gloves, look, she's got black gloves.  My top five just changed again.  What do you do?  Yeah, I don't know.  What happened, Greg?  Look at, look at the reshoot of number 69.  And she's bottomless and she has her hand in the way.  Everyone, uh.  How sexy is that?  Look at that.  Everyone in the studio is going to do a reshoot to her reshoot.  Believe me.  I'm redirecting my shoot.  What do we got more? 
[02:37:30]  All right, listen, why don't we take a break?  Oh, we got.  Oh, goodness, lesbians.  I think the winner should be whoever hardens the most pairs of socks.  Where's that, Ben?  76.  76, that's reshoot pictures of 76?  Oh, with her three different outfits and, yeah, look at them.  Give me a break, Sacramento.  You guys are so full of crap. 
[02:38:00]  These are not regular girls.  All right.  No.  Hey, Frenchie's in the studio.  We got the dueling retards, Frenchie versus Marion.  People like them.  So check it out.  And when we get back, I guess we get into, who's that?  Stormy, number 84, second round.  Stormy, number 84.  Four.  All these pictures must have went up recently.  What's the name?  Stormy.  Not bad.  Is that a real name?  There's a little duck in that one shot, but the side shots are nice. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, oh.  You like this dirty girl from Philly.  Go down one, yeah, I know.  Taylor.  We're looking at her.  There's an up view, like, from the bottom.  I'm like, you're looking up at her hiney from the back.  Oh, that's lovely.  Very nice.  Oof.  That's lovely.  Just gawking over these pictures.  All right, check this out, and we'll be back.  Frenchie!  Yes!  How you doing?  Hey, how you guys been?  Two annoying bitches. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, goose crap!  Retarded whole bag.  You Canadian, where?  You annoying fat whole bag.  Are you from Canada?  I'm not from Canada, you twat.  Where's your home?  Do you have a home?  You down to them, twat whole fat bitch.  You Canadian gang.  Shut up, you twat.  Why don't you go fall into a big bat of carousine? 
[02:39:30]  When I saw you the first time, I looked at you and said, she has to be the dumbest boy in the world.  Go find a park, you crap.  Yeah, yeah, shut the head up, you whore.  You sound like a retard.  Why do I shut up?  The only thing you know is succeed, you whore bag.  You sound like you're queer.  You must have a chromosome left over in the toilet every time you go to the bathroom.  Why don't you cross the river so the alligators can get you?  Shut up, bud.  Go find a park, you crap.  Yeah, yeah, shut the head up.  You look like a down-sit-on-bitch and you're married.  I don't know what kind of husband you have. 
[02:40:00]  Friendship, friendship, friendship.  Why don't you goddamn die already?  Why don't you die first?  I'll die after.  Die, die, get in the coffin and die.  You want to touch it?  This isn't happening to me.  Go on.  Touch it.  I'm not face down in a pillow.  Touch it.  With my little baseball cleats on.  Go on.  While the coaches touch it.  Teaching me a lesson.  Opie and Anthony.  We're trying to get away from that brand of humor.  Crinkle, crinkle.  And E.W. 
[02:40:30]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Good one, Ben.  Good one.  Professional radio at its best.  Hit it harder.  Pounding on a CD machine.  Now you're switching tracks.  Hit it harder.  Hey, we're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  There you go.  Just like Friday, the last 20 minutes of the show is going to be a Cluster F, right?  Okay.  It's not right.  It's a instant.  Yeah, that's our music.  All right. 
[02:41:00]  There we go.  There we go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys are doing.  Doing all right, Tom.  Doing all right.  A couple more of the contestants want to say hi, Ant.  The voting has begun on the Naughty Naughty Contest.  You're just tuning in.  We have 98 girls.  We've got to get it down to 20.  How the hell are we going to do that?  So it's like a preliminary voting thing happening.  Next Monday, we'll be down to 20 with thumbnails and everything.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:41:30]  So we've got to weed out about 78 girls from the contest in the next week.  You can vote like once a day.  So if there's a few girls you still like, you know, you can spread out your votes during the week.  Sure.  Okay.  Go to opianthony.com and make your vote count.  Let's go to Megan.  Contestant number 58.  Oh, oh.  Let me pump that up.  Hold on, Megan.  We've got to see your picture.  Hold on.  We need the visual when we talk to you girls.  Yay.  All the website's getting slammed. 
[02:42:00]  We can't even get to your picture.  Very difficult.  Oh.  Yeah, I can't get it either.  Oh, it was close.  I served the chowder for you guys in Boston.  Oh, hey.  What's up?  Oh, Megan.  What's up?  Your pictures are back up there.  You're the girl from California?  That's right.  Yeah, she was really hot.  Really hot.  Big G&Ds.  She was, you're about 5'4", 5'5".  About.  Brunette.  Hair a little below the earlobes. 
[02:42:30]  Petite with very nice boobs.  You're wearing like a black see-through number.  All right.  I've got a reshoot.  I've got a red number.  She has her reshoot.  And me and I think Anthony, we're checking on your pictures and you're in the other studio  with your boyfriend as I'm going, nice, nice, nice.  That's you, right?  That's me.  There you go.  Very, very, very hot.  I can't see him though right now.  Everyone's pounding this website. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, that sucks.  Is there anything you want to say to the voters?  No, I guess I just wanted to say that I'm 100% real girl.  That's my real hair, my real skin color, my real breasts and everything.  Oh, are you making some allegations with them?  I am not.  I'm just saying it doesn't take a lot of makeup and glitter.  Oh.  And you're a BU girl.  That's right.  A natural girl.  I think I know more about you than my own girlfriend. 
[02:43:30]  I'm your girl next door.  All right, Megan.  Well, good luck in the contest, okay?  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  There she goes.  Contestant number 58.  Let's go to contestant number 77, Tarina.  Tarina.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Well, our listeners have shut down all our websites, so we don't even know what you look  like.  How come it says Karen?  Yeah.  Yes.  Hello?  Hello.  Hi, Tarina.  Hello.  Yeah, how are you guys doing?  All right.  I'd like to have your job, I'll tell you that much. 
[02:44:00]  Why's that?  Because it seems like a lot of fun.  Where are you from?  I'm actually Canadian.  I'm from Toronto.  Yeah?  Go down.  But no, I'm from Buffalo.  Buffalo, cool.  All right.  Let me, oh, it says Karen, though.  Yeah, it is Karen.  My nickname is Karina, because, uh...  Oh, wait, you're the, you're the, uh...  Yes, yes, yes.  You're the blue knot monster.  Yeah, I thought that was a little ploy, just to get me a little, get me a little teed  off, to make me call in.  Look at this.  This is what I know about you.  You're a secretary. 
[02:44:30]  Oh.  Uh, you're the, you're the, uh, African princess with the tan lines and the, uh, the pimp jacket.  Uh, with the little Santa, uh, uh, the negligee thing, the red.  Yeah.  Uh, with the white cotton-y, uh...  Yes, yes, yes.  ...collar and cuffs and all that.  You're beautiful.  And one of your ex-boyfriends, uh, called up and said that you're a anal monster.  Yeah, that's right, okay?  That's like a wannabe, okay, sweetheart?  Why would happen?  Okay.  Is that...  Because if anything that I don't do is that, because you know why?  The front end works out better. 
[02:45:00]  Like, believe me.  Oh, okay.  I don't need to have to worry about my back end.  He was full of crap.  I think so.  So that was a bunch of bunk what he was saying.  You better believe it, honey.  I'm a designer.  And you know what?  Your voice isn't as hot as your pictures.  Oh, God.  So, I don't mind.  She sounds like a smoker from Fargo.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  Maybe it's the phone.  I don't know.  You got that little, uh, Canadian accent working, though.  Oh, well, I should be, because I am Canadian.  I remember that accent from my Buffalo days.  Are you coming to Buffalo sometimes?  Uh, sometimes. 
[02:45:30]  To get some wobbly pups?  Well, uh, no.  I was just going to say, I have, like, 30 models up here, too, because I'm a designer.  I make women's bathing suits.  Yeah, you're beautiful.  You really are.  And usually we just say that, but you really are.  Oh, yeah.  No, let me ask you something.  Uh, have any one of you two, uh, went with a woman of color?  Yep.  No.  See, I've been trying for a while.  No.  When I was in Buffalo, I used to go to the black clubs, uh, trying to pick up, uh,  black women, and it never happened. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, that must have just been the funniest goddamn thing.  That was open.  That's a real story.  No kidding.  Yeah.  That's too bad.  You don't know what you're missing.  I had a, I had a, I had a, a fetish for black women like you won't believe, especially when  I was up in Buffalo.  Well, they do tan, so.  I'll never hook up with another Canadian girl.  You're very beautiful.  I've hooked up with, like, four Canadian girls in my life.  Oh, here's the, here's the question, though.  Every one of them had a box that smelled like an armpit.  Every Canadian chick I ever hooked up with.  I'm not saying you, but I'm telling you, the four Canadian girls in my life.  The only Canadian girls I've went with have all been horrendous. 
[02:46:30]  I'm sorry, miss.  You ever see a black woman's clam?  Well, listen, also.  They've all been white, by the way, the Canadian chicks.  I took some other pictures, though, and they never even put them on.  Oh, ho, ho.  Other girls got, like, you know.  All right, well, if Scott has the pictures, they will be up.  I hope so.  I promise.  Give me a better chance here.  I like the pictures that I'm looking at right now.  I know, but you know.  I think a black chick digs me.  You know?  All right.  Well, thank you, Karen.  You're welcome. 
[02:47:00]  Good luck in the contest.  Okay, thank you.  And that was a rumor.  You're not the anal monster.  No, no, darling.  Hey, do you go to tanning booths?  The blue nut hasn't been touched.  What?  Do you go to tanning booths?  I have my own tanning bed.  You do, see?  Yes.  Because everyone's like, wow, the sister with tan lines.  That's right.  Like, who the hell sees that?  We do bleed and we do breathe.  Well, I know that.  We can.  The thing about the tan part, because our own black girl here has never heard of that.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, I've always tanned.  All right.  Well, good luck to you. 
[02:47:30]  Okay, thank you.  All right.  Godspeed.  There he goes.  Hold on, hold on.  What?  Tarina, hold on.  What?  He's from New Orleans.  He wants to say something to you.  All right.  Hey, Ricky.  Hey, what's up?  What's up?  You're a little dude, yo.  You sure you don't have no, you know, weenie bird or whatever?  Honey, believe me.  If you've seen me, I don't even think you'd be able to do it.  I don't know about that, but I'm just telling you.  I am all one.  I mean, you know, you sound like a little dude, you know what I'm saying?  But, I mean, you'll fit in very nice in New Orleans. 
[02:48:00]  You know what I'm saying?  And you're a brother, and you're a brother, and you're going to cut me down like this, sir?  Why are you a player hater?  Okay.  Be a player participator.  I'm a half-finger here, and you're going to cut me down like that?  Oh, man, but come on.  How many women of color are in the contest?  Not many, right?  But I stood up and said, okay, I'm going to do this.  Yeah.  Right?  And then you're going to come here, and you're going to cut me down?  Come on, man.  Look.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Oh, my bad. 
[02:48:30]  I'm sure you're fine or something.  Hey, hey, hey.  Dude, my bad, all right?  You know what I'm saying?  I'm just tripping out off you right now.  All right.  Yeah.  I don't care, Pology.  All right, cab driver, Ricky.  Thank you.  You have to check it out.  Y'all should have went to She-She's when y'all was out here, man.  Well, thanks for telling us now.  What is She-She's?  In other words, $10 for a lap dance and $20 for VIP, and you could damn to do whatever  you want.  And y'all missed out on that.  I would have took y'all there.  All right.  Thank you, Ricky.  Peace.  Hey, Tarina, good luck to you. 
[02:49:00]  I think you're beautiful.  Okay, thank you.  I really do.  He's ready to get them to put my other pictures up, though.  We will try.  If he has them, they'll be up, all right?  Okay, thanks.  I promise.  All right.  Okay, bye-bye.  Time to play what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show today.  I learned she's not the anal monster.  I'm kind of bummed about that.  You know, it was kind of an image I liked.  I think that would have helped her with some votes.  I have.  Sheep Lover writes, I learned today, well, blank in your mouth before 12 is slutty. 
[02:49:30]  Sheep Lover again.  I learned today, Star Jones is Al Roker with junk.  That's right.  Leisure Anthony.  Today, I learned that Star Jones needs magic to give her the HIV to lose weight.  And Star Jones goes to the car wash day spa.  Jersey Gary, I learned today, if your woman falls into water, it's sink or swim, bitch.  Right.  He also learned you can tell the girth of the mule by the skull.  He also learned Star Jones gets her pampering at the blacksmith and a cleansing at the car wash. 
[02:50:00]  And Opie truly is the taint master reading taint through the computer.  The taint master.  Fat Brian from Philly.  I learned that the only thing Norton hates more than having his head licked by a drunken Cajun is the quality of strippers.  The quality of strippers in New Orleans and the word perpendicular.  Sheep Lover, I learned today, Rick beats his wife.  What are you saying, Frenchy? 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, you take it.  You take that punch.  Yeah, you take it.  I beat your head over the ground.  Stuff you never heard in the World War II era, France.  You lose the card, I kill you.  Cut your bag off, you son of a bitch.  Wow, Frenchy, you're losing your heat.  Oh, Frenchy, come on.  I mean, you've got to, you know, save it.  How are you guys doing?  Doing good, Tom.  Doing good.  You've got to save it.  Thank you. 
[02:51:00]  Hey, Frenchy, are you going to be visiting Ron and Fez tonight?  No, I don't know.  Why?  Oh, okay.  He was asking for a spot on their show today.  No, no, I was just saying I was going to hang out one night.  That's all.  Suck it, you whore.  You speak.  Wow.  Come on, Rick.  A speak.  A speak.  What's a speak?  At least I can't speak.  You wet back.  Okay, you like that better?  Okay, you got me.  All right, let's say good, Andy.  Andy, what's going on? 
[02:51:30]  Hey, what's up, ONA?  Hey, man.  I learned the best place to view your batches on a vasectomy scar.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  I'm going to side with my city and vote for one of these girls from Boston.  They're all hot.  Right on, man.  Ah.  Except for maybe one of them.  Okay, cool.  Pass.  Nice.  Just vote for your favorite.  That's it.  Don't even think about where they're coming from.  Opie and Anthony.com.  Noti90 contest.  The voting has begun.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I learned that there's something in the air in Buffalo that makes us white guys want 
[02:52:00]  black chicks.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I'm definitely like that, too.  I think it's got to be something in the air.  All right.  Very good, Mike.  Joe, I'm sorry.  I'm going to Mike.  It's a taboo.  Mike, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Yo, what night?  Hey.  Hey.  I learned that all streets in New Orleans run either perpendicular or parallel to Bourbon Street.  Sorry, Norton.  That's all right.  And then he apologized.  Oh, yeah.  And, of course, Al Mack learned that Bourbon Street is a two-mile colon. 
[02:52:30]  I love that one.  That was a good line.  It stunk.  Anthony, what's up?  Howdy.  Hey, faggot?  Faggot.  What's up?  Yo, I learned that Norton has a very tasty head year to year.  Year to year?  Yes.  Yo, Rick, I want to let you know I got a hot tub if you want to come over.  Later on, guys.  All right.  Yeah, let me play that.  Hey, Rick.  We're going to go back to our house.  We got a hot tub, baby.  Baby.  Baby.  We got a hot tub, baby.  Hey, there, baby.  Hey, there, baby. 
[02:53:00]  Hey, there, baby.  Well, Ken wants to talk about the Buffalo girl that just called in.  Ken, what's up?  She doesn't take it in the back door, and she thinks that's going to get her vote?  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, she should have said, she should have admitted that she was the anal monster.  I don't think you call up and say what you don't do.  You want to call up and tell what you do do.  Absolutely.  Do do.  I'm with Norton.  If it's a nasty girl, she's got my vote and probably my money.  All right.  Thank you, Ken.  I want to hear a girl who takes it in the back door until the bed looks like stew has been  stilled on us. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, God.  Norton, hitting the road.  All the concert dates are up on eatabullet.com?  Not yet, no, because there's tickets to on sale Friday for all of them, but they will  be up this week, and people on my mailing list, I'll send it up.  All right, cool.  Thanks, man.  Taylor, contestant number 79.  You're from Philly, right?  Yes.  You're beautiful.  You know what's going to hurt you in this contest?  What?  The shadows. 
[02:54:00]  That's not my fault.  I know.  I'm a camera guy.  But people are definitely giving you mad props, as they say.  Mad props.  Mad props.  Where are you from, Angel?  Philly.  Philly, Ben Salem.  Can you go back for a reshoot?  Is that possible?  Probably, yeah.  Maybe.  See how I help?  Go to 79.  I'm telling you, this girl is getting a lot of interest from our listeners.  And I just think if Rick took the photos, I have to say it, I think Rick would have helped  your chances. 
[02:54:30]  Actually, I think, who took my pictures?  Rick.  Wasn't it?  Oh, wow.  You're getting slammed.  Yeah, I'm trying.  Well, your pictures are getting slammed.  We can't see your pictures now.  Oh, there you go.  Rick, did you take this girl's pictures?  No.  No, Rick would have never done the shadow thing on your face.  What's the girl thing?  You got a smoking body.  Thank you.  And you know how to pose.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But the shadow's in the face, right, Ann?  Shadows are terrible. 
[02:55:00]  And then, not only that, I'll tell you something else about the shadows.  There's shadows on your body where it looks like it was coming through your top while you're  pulling it out.  And it makes your body look weird.  I know.  Like there's something weird going on.  All that shadows, it looks like an Orson Welles.  No, no, stop.  No, no.  Oh, they're saying we got to go.  Taylor, call us tomorrow because we wanted to talk to you, all right?  We just ran out of time today.  All right.  All right, there goes Taylor, contestant number 79.  See you.  Go to the last shot of the reshoot where she's laying on her back. 
[02:55:30]  That's the picture.  That's hot.  That's the picture.  Oh, wait, the second, all right, the second group of shots definitely helped your call.  Wow.  Isn't that good?  Very nice.  You can picture that moment where she lifts her ass up and you pull those panties off,  right?  Yeah, and you hear her go.  Taylor, very nice.  I think you got a good chance at this contest.  Thank you.  All right, there she goes.
