<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a raucous Friday affair brimming with vulgar humor and off-color discussions.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, opened with their usual brand of raunchy banter, mocking aging rock stars like Def Leppard's Joe Elliott for forgetting lyrics during a VH1 Storytellers performance and discussing a German version of a Dirk Homassar song.  They then launched into a detailed recap of the previous night's *Survivor*, focusing heavily on the contestants' weight loss and the physical attributes of Kimmy and Elizabeth, whose elimination was discussed, with plans to interview her later.  A significant portion of the show was dedicated to their ongoing whipped cream bikini contest, featuring calls from contestants and sponsors, along with expressions of frustration towards *Extra* for not properly crediting the show when airing footage.  The hosts debated their favorite comedians – Jim Brewer (Opie's favorite, though this was debated), Brian Regan, Adam Ferrara, and Louis Black (who called in to discuss a comedy award win) – interspersing these discussions with descriptions of a graphic and violent pornography video and other sexually explicit material, fueled by caller contributions.  A representative from a Palisades Mall sticker promotion also called in.  The show also included mentions of upcoming media appearances, including a television segment and a movie review for a comedian friend.

The show continued with a segment focusing on absurd restaurant theme ideas (Nazi memorabilia and NRA-themed), the commercialization of historical sites (Vietnam War tunnels), and the contrast between Times Square's chain restaurants and the perceived lack of uniqueness in New York City.  The hosts discussed the underground syndication of their show, receiving calls from listeners detailing their methods of accessing and sharing the content.  The whipped cream bikini contest continued to dominate, with contestants calling in or visiting the studio, showing pictures to comedian guest Lewis Black (who called in) and later to Brian Regan, who was in studio.  Calls from members of the "O&A Army" highlighted the show's syndication.  A caller described a local wrestling company using Opie and Anthony branding, mentioning a wrestler named "The Cleveland Steamer," with audio from his segment played.  The hosts advertised Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed and Planet Java, and Buzz from *Home Alone* made a surprise in-studio appearance.  The segment concluded with a "F*** You Friday" segment and further discussion of the bikini contest.


Brian Regan's in-studio appearance followed, beginning with a *Ed Wood* clip discussion.  This transitioned to a surprisingly cautious discussion about Sarah Jessica Parker's attractiveness, followed by an unexpected discussion of Adolf Hitler, with Regan stating Hitler "should not have done what he did," leading to playful teasing.  Listener calls, including one about a webcam overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge (which turned out to be a misinterpretation), interspersed with Regan's stand-up style storytelling about snow cones and little league baseball,  and an offensive joke about "slow people" being slaughtered, followed by a quick backtrack from both Regan and the hosts.  The hosts promoted their "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" segment and engaged in a protracted bit about gracefully ending a guest's visit.  Numerous vulgar listener calls, listener-generated punchlines to an acronym joke, and a discussion about Timothy McVeigh's execution timing continued.  The segment concluded with calls, promotional announcements, continued banter, Regan's send-off, and a final chaotic frisbee-throwing incident.  Throughout, the hosts mentioned sponsors and promotions, including the whipped cream bikini contest and a *Survivor* giveaway.

The final segment heavily featured the whipped cream bikini contest, focusing on contestant Savannah, who, with encouragement from the hosts and Igor (a *Sopranos* actor), removed her clothing to reveal suggestive underwear. Igor's presence led to numerous jokes about his appearance.  A *Survivor* town hall meeting trip contest, using a CBS 2 News video clip, was also featured, along with promotion of "Pinnacle Monkeying Around."  Filter called in briefly, and the hosts discussed hairstyles.  A "What Did We Learn" segment followed, filled with crude and humorous observations from callers, many referencing Brian Regan.  More female contestants joined the studio, with further commentary on their physical attributes.  One contestant showed off her physique before the show concluded with a "F.U. Friday" segment featuring angry listener messages.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie, I'm the dick. Anthony. Yeah, well, I'm an ass.  On the Opie and Anthony show, I would have rather watched my grandparents give oral pleasure to each other.  Oh, 107. WNEW.  It's Friday! Friday!  Friday! Hey, everybody! We're all going to get late! 
[00:00:30]  Hey! Cancel your appointments!  Yeah, baby!  That's a winner! 
[00:01:00]  What do you see in me?  What do you see in me?  Nice taste, Pete.  Yeah, I got sort of a kind of one.  Here's the delicious. 
[00:01:30]  George! It's gorgeous!  It's going to make you puke!  It looks like a moran.  It's in the hole!  Can we see your stuff?  Ah!  Ooh! Ooh!  No!  No!  No! 
[00:02:00]  Ah!  Ah, man, this is a dog cat!  I need to be bad!  It's the ODA show!  Hey!  It's Friday!  Thank God!  Thank God is right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7 is our phone number.  Yeah.  And we are ready to broadcast.  Yeah!  Oh, I want to play that again.  I love that music.  Sweet! 
[00:02:30]  Merciful crap!  Ah, Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, listen, I'm trying to get pumped up for the show.  It's Friday afternoon, and Ben's an effing clue.  Why?  That's what the guy's pushing on me.  Come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Honey!  That's not pleasant.  What is it?  Honey, here I am, pumped up, ready to go, Friday afternoon, pour sugar on me.  We play Def Leppard for a goof.  Well, I hope...  For a goof.  Every once in a while, you've got to do something for a goof.  We're all, like, yelling it in here like it's 1987 again or something. 
[00:03:00]  We're the standards for Ben Apollo.  You know what?  Every time you have a one-armed drummer, pick the tape.  You shouldn't make fun of the one-armed drummer.  He did quite a job after he lost the band.  Oh, come on.  He did quite a job.  We should be doing weddings.  All right.  Thanks, Dave.  That's one of those songs, though, you hear it in your car.  You'll never admit to your friends that you still like the song, but if you're alone,  you're like, you're singing.  Right. 
[00:03:30]  It's one of those songs.  Brings you right back.  Praying no one sees you singing that song in the car.  Yeah, you even shut the moonroof.  And then you call the radio show and say how much it's stocked.  Right.  Just to save fate.  For the thing.  For the thing.  Paul, what's going on?  How are you?  All right.  You're on the radio, Paul.  Oh, I'm on the radio?  Yeah.  Yeah, he used to be Jim Brewer's personal trainer in the city.  What?  Obviously, he didn't do a good job. 
[00:04:00]  No, I know.  He still has his man breast.  I don't know.  Yeah, he was a good guy, though.  He's from Long Island, too.  I'm from Long Island.  Right on.  How was your show?  I'm going to come down tonight.  It was a great show.  Yeah, I hope he went last night.  I had a lot of fun.  You know what?  It needs to be said.  Brewer, my favorite comic.  Wow.  Well, he's really only appreciated by people from Long Island  to have that little thread of white trash element.  There's something about his act that I really, really enjoy.  I don't know if it's because we're from the same kind of area on Long Island or what, 
[00:04:30]  but he's always changing his act.  It's always fresh.  A lot of stuff you can always relate to.  Well, he's either you or, like with me, he's either me or my brother.  You know, and every time he does a parent, he's just like my mother.  Yeah.  Whether people want to admit it or not, we're all stoner jackasses.  Yeah, he's great.  Thanks, Paul.  All right.  Take care.  All right.  He's got a bit, and I hope he does it again tonight.  Yeah.  I'm just making out, and that's all I'm going to say  because I want it to be a surprise for, you know, the people that go tonight. 
[00:05:00]  Making out.  F-ing hilarious.  After the show, I'm hanging, you know, backstage like we do,  and I'm like, bro, man, that make-out bit.  Man.  He goes, yeah, I kind of just thought about that.  Thought that like two days ago.  Figured I'd give it a shot on stage.  Killed.  Killed.  Nice.  Nice.  Very good.  There you have it.  All right.  Mitchell, what's going on?  Mitchell.  Hello.  How are you guys today, man?  We're doing all right.  Did anybody catch Jeff Weppard last night on the VH1 Storytellers? 
[00:05:30]  They had the VH1 Storytellers.  Oh, my God.  In the middle of the song, Joe Elliott forgets the words to the song.  You want to talk about an embarrassment?  No way.  What's wrong?  I was rolling.  I was rolling.  They had a stop.  He literally forgot the words to rock on.  Oh.  It was humiliating for him.  Plus, his voice was so bad that my dog was howling in the backyard.  Yeah.  A lot of these bands that had the singers with the real high voices, a few years later, you 
[00:06:00]  realize this guy doesn't have anything anymore.  You know who still has the high voice, though?  Geddy Lee.  Geddy Lee?  Yeah.  Geddy Lee put out that solo project a few months back.  He was in the studio.  And he still has the pipes.  He's still got it.  But a lot of them have it.  I can't imagine what compels these guys.  And I don't want to get up in front of a live audience, but to have it broadcasted in  front of millions of people.  Well, because they don't realize it's over, John.  You know?  They want to keep being famous and doing their thing.  Somebody's got to send Joe Elliott a candy gram.  And inside the candy gram, put the words to the song. 
[00:06:30]  Oh.  Wow.  That's weird.  Frank Sinatra forgot the words to his songs at the end.  Yeah.  He was ancient.  Well, when Sinatra was old, they used to put monitors all around him.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With the words to the song so that he didn't look like a complete fool.  Well, he still looked like a complete fool.  And I know that's going to...  With the bad toupee and the monitors.  Yeah.  I know that's going to piss off some people, but it's like, you've got to realize when  to step off the stage and just...  Exactly.  Exactly.  He's a legend.  You don't want people to remember you like that.  No.  You know? 
[00:07:00]  Sebastian Bach still has, like, the high voice.  Like, he's able to...  I caught that.  I saw him in Jekyll and Hyde.  And you know what?  Everyone was expecting me to come in here and say how much it sucked and all that.  It didn't suck, and he did a really good job, and yeah, he still has his voice.  You know who sucks when every few years he attempts to sing the old songs?  Robert Plant.  Like, don't even attempt any Zeppelin songs.  Because they will sound nothing like you remember them.  Yeah.  There's somebody, you know, you want to throw some new songs together and pitch that stuff 
[00:07:30]  down a few octaves?  Fine.  But, man, he tries to sing the Zeppelin tunes, and...  But you know what?  Horrible.  To his credit, though, he doesn't do it often.  He's just kind of...  He's kind of just in the, you know...  He's just kind of off...  Yeah.  ...in the wigs.  You know who else has a hard time singing a lot of his songs?  Elton John.  The Hyde notes on a lot of the songs.  He's got, like, four black chicks behind him that catch all those parts.  It's pretty weird.  I thought his voice would be okay.  I mean, his throat's well lubed.  Well lubricated. 
[00:08:00]  Sure.  High protein flush.  Sure.  It's on his throat.  Yeah, yeah, you never know.  Yeah, but sometimes it's just like, don't even attempt it.  Well, got a bum today, Anthony.  Why?  Elizabeth got thrown off Survivor last night.  And we shan't be talking to her?  No.  Why not?  Because they're punishing us for some reason.  No, that's unacceptable.  Even though we're doing some huge promotion with them, you know?  Yeah.  One of our listeners is going to go to L.A. for the last episode of Survivor next week. 
[00:08:30]  We'll have details later, but hopefully you're watching the CBS Morning News.  In the 6 o'clock hour, they had a little vignette.  Yeah, and if you watched it.  Of you and I, and we're going to ask a question about the vignette, and you'll be a qualifier,  and then we'll pick the grand prize next week.  Yeah.  So I guess she's not coming in for the whipped cream bikini thing?  No.  Elizabeth?  Elizabeth?  No, I'm not like Kimmy.  She's the hottest one on the show.  Elizabeth?  Yeah.  Oh, by far.  Yeah.  Not to take away from the gorgeous Kimmy.  Well, Kimmy's like the loosest one. 
[00:09:00]  See, most people still haven't seen Kimmy in the flesh yet.  What do you mean?  Well, we saw her in the flesh in more ways than one, but I mean, you know, just face-to-face  or whatever.  Right, right.  The girl's beautiful.  Yeah.  And on that Survivor, she looked kind of piggy.  She looked pretty bad.  She looked really skinny and kind of like beat up.  Right.  On the show.  And then she comes in here, and, you know, she looks great.  But Elizabeth got kicked off.  And you know what, though? 
[00:09:30]  We're going to be meeting her.  Why?  Can I tell the folks?  Go ahead, Ed.  What?  You know how we go to the River Rave every year in Boston?  Yes.  She's going to be there.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Going to be at the River Rave.  Yeah.  Because she's a Boston chick.  So we'll get her on the show either way.  Nice.  I'm making sure we have a dat recorder.  But live, you know how we push you out.  It's easy over the phone.  You know what?  It's pretty disturbing to watch Survivor.  Yeah.  These people are losing so much effing weight. 
[00:10:00]  Tina, the girl that's in her, I don't know, early 40s, I would have to guess, 41, 42 possibly.  Yeah.  Where we're all convinced she has, like, the breast implants.  Uh-huh.  She is so skinny that she's got just these two boob bags just hanging off her body at this point.  Ah!  And they gave the contestants, like, a scale yesterday to see how much they lost.  She was down to, I think it was 99 pounds.  Are you kidding?  And it was just, like, she has boobs just hanging. 
[00:10:30]  Just, it was disgusting.  Yeesh.  They all lost, like, 25 pounds.  One guy lost 27.  Wow.  So, ah, well, there's barely any food to eat.  What's this?  Ah, all right.  Hey, Earl.  Yo, what's up?  Okay, this is what we're going to do, okay?  You're at a sticker stop, right?  Yes, we are.  Okay, Ant and I were talking about this the other day, you know, when we listen to the radio stations  and they go to their guy in the field.  It's smooth. 
[00:11:00]  You know, we're going to intro you, you're going to say what you have to say,  and you're going to wrap it up nicely at the end, all right?  And then we're going to move on, okay?  Yes, sir.  All right, so you ready to give this a shot?  Yeah.  Okay, here we go.  They do this so well on other stations, Ant.  Here it goes.  Okay.  Anthony, we got Black Earl.  Ah, Earl at one of our WOW sticker stops.  I believe he's in Nyack, New York.  Let's check in with Black Earl.  Earl, what's going on today?  Hi, guys.  We're at the Palisades Mall in Nyack, New York, which is Exit 12, right up the New York State  Thruway.  We're parked right behind the Bed Bath & Beyond and Rainforest Cafe, right up of Lot 34. 
[00:11:30]  And we're going to have some WOW stickers for the next hour.  Hey, Earl.  That sounds great.  Great.  Earl, you did good.  Look at that info.  Just flying out of them.  Usually the other stations, though, they give the DJ back in the studio something that they  know means they're done, though.  Right, right.  So you should have wrapped it up like, you know... 
[00:12:00]  And this is Earl Douglas with you, live in Nyack, New York.  On?  WNEW 102.7.  All right.  Thank you, Earl.  All right.  We'll check in with you in a little while.  See, that's easy.  Go see Earl and get your WOW sticker.  That's right.  Thank you, Earl.  Wow.  He sounded up.  He had the info.  Like a new Earl.  Right.  Like a new Earl.  And as you head to see Earl this afternoon, we'll have more of your favorites from the  80s.  Dirk Homassar coming up.  Dirk Homassar. 
[00:12:30]  The German version.  Oh-ho.  Going to get a little wacky on this 80s hour music station.  You're insane.  Going to play the German version of Dirk Homassar.  Uh-oh.  All 80s.  Zha-Zha.  All right.  That's good.  Someone saw the thing on Kimmy on Extra.  Yeah.  Because we have a problem with that again.  Yeah.  Let's go, Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  How you feeling?  Uh, we're doing well. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  I seen Kimmy this morning on Extra.  Uh, oh, they re-ran it this morning?  Yep.  They were showing the picture of her with the whipped cream on her.  You know, Extra, you let us down again.  You let us down.  Yep.  And...  All they said was WNEW.  They didn't say that 1027, right?  Of course not.  We, you know, they begged and wanted the pictures of Kimmy in the whipped cream bikini  so bad that we were going back and forth.  The lawyers were getting involved.  All we asked Extra, we could have asked for a lot of money for those pictures because now  they're going to be everywhere.  They're already on a ton of websites.  They're in... 
[00:13:30]  Oh, yeah, definitely.  They're being printed in newspapers.  They were on Extra this morning and last night.  All we asked Extra was simple.  We could have nailed them for a lot of money.  We said, no, we don't want the money, none of that.  All we asked is that you tell everyone where the pictures came from.  Opie and Anthony.  Not the radio station.  We made it clear.  Not...  All they said was WNEW.  They screwed you guys.  Well, it was in a contract, too.  Like, if you're going to, you know, show the pictures on Extra, please say, you know,  Kimmy was on the Opie and Anthony show in New York City.  That's all we wanted and they couldn't even do that for us. 
[00:14:00]  That's like Extra doing something and the only recognition they get is somebody mentioning  something happened on whatever, Channel 11 or whatever the hell they're on.  Yeah, pretty much.  Well, I'll ask them anyway.  You know what, though?  It's still cool, but once again, we got dicked over.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, take care, guys.  All right.  Smoke weed every day.  Smoke weed every day.  All right.  Stupid Extra.  I mean, give us a little credit.  So we asked, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:14:30]  That's all.  We had a whole story on Dateline about the Voyeur bus.  Not one mention.  Not even a mention for the radio station.  We set up the whole mess.  TV stations are always, they never want to really tell who's doing what.  They try to be so vague when it comes to radio things.  You know?  They never say who's doing it.  So a radio station or how about a New York radio station?  Oh, that narrows it down.  The funny thing is, though, when a radio show or a radio station screws up real bad, oh, 
[00:15:00]  they'll make sure they tell everyone what station it was and what show.  Oh, yeah.  You'll know.  Bastards, man.  Just scum.  And then we got a call from 2020 Downtown.  Mm-hmm.  Looks like one of the reporters.  Yeah.  Fan of the show.  So she's saying.  Mm-hmm.  Wants to do a big piece on our radio program.  Oh, really?  2020 Downtown.  I think that's the 2020 version they do, what, during the week?  Mm-hmm.  Where they're on top of one of the buildings in Times Square? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah.  So we're trying to work out the details of that because we still have a few and they just  want to screw us.  But we're pretty paranoid.  And I don't even care about a screw job.  I don't care if they want to do a segment on us and trash us.  I don't care about that.  We just don't want to be kind of lumped in, you know, where we get two seconds of air time  and then they go to a Bubba the Love Sponge from Florida and talk about something waxenarific  that he did, you know?  It's just getting us on there and saying, you know, these guys suck and, you know, they're 
[00:16:00]  they're harmful to children and they're dirty.  That's fine.  Yeah.  I like that.  We'll see what happens.  We're working out the details.  Yeah.  All right.  Anthony, whipped cream bikini contest.  Yeah.  How's that going today now?  Do we have someone outside already?  Oh, we have a contestant.  We already have our first contestant of the day.  All right.  Ladies, come down.  Stink, are you happy with the contestant?  Very.  Very happy?  Very happy.  Good.  Finalist.  A finalist. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, look at Stink.  Stink is saying a finalist is out there.  Look at Stink.  All right.  Well, we're going to extend the qualifying all next week because a bunch of ladies begged  us to because they couldn't get down this week.  So, ladies, are you paying attention?  Mm-hmm.  You're going to have another week to come down and show off what you got and get into one  of these whipped cream bikini con bathing suits.  We'd like you to come in today.  It's Friday.  You know, party atmosphere.  Yeah, please.  We need some help today.  Trip to Hawaii.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Grand prize trip to Hawaii.  Contiki tours.  Thank you very much. 
[00:17:00]  Victory Limousine.  And thank you very much.  Yes.  And, of course, whipped cream bikini.com.  Thank you very much.  All right?  Yeah.  And, of course, oh, Brewer is coming in.  I should have mentioned that when we were talking about him earlier.  And one of our faves.  Brian Regan.  Brian Regan.  Now, Opie, you said Brewer was your favorite comic.  Yeah.  Now, what about Brian Regan's going to come in now?  And you're going to tell him he's your third, fourth what?  What number does Brian Regan have?  Brian Regan is my favorite as well, but not as much favorite as Brewer. 
[00:17:30]  Whoa.  Almost as favorite.  I don't think you could pick favorite comics.  I don't think so.  I think it's like trying to pick a, I don't know, Brewer's great.  It changes, though.  And what he's doing there, but their acts are so different.  It's okay.  Yeah.  We love all the guys that come on our show.  I think the guys know that.  Right now, I'm digging Brewer and what he's doing.  That's all.  All right.  Really digging it.  All right.  Now, you deal with that with Brian Regan. 
[00:18:00]  All right.  He was my favorite two months ago.  You're fickle.  Well, it's kind of like music.  Can't listen to Def Leppard all your life.  You've got to kind of keep moving around, you know?  You certainly can.  You're going to put me in a bad position today.  Yeah.  Well, you went out on a limb there and appointed a favorite.  Who's your favorite, Anthony?  Are you brave enough to tell everyone who your favorite comic is that appears on our show?  I really don't have a favorite, but I have to say Adam Ferrara, my pal. 
[00:18:30]  Adam Ferrara?  What about, I don't know, Louis Black?  Louis Black, very funny, but it's a totally different type of act.  Not as funny as Adam Ferrara?  Can't compare the two.  It's like comparing rock and country.  Really?  You know what I mean?  So Louis is kind of like a lame country act.  Yeah, Louis sucks.  And no.  Louis's ideology is a little twisted, but I love his act.  Hey, Louis.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up?  A little twisted, huh? 
[00:19:00]  Coming from you, it's like a compliment.  I wanted to thank you guys.  Speaking of compliment, look at you.  You won.  Well, thanks.  I thank you guys.  Thanks a lot.  What did you win?  What did I win?  I won used car dealerships.  I won the American comedy award for the comic with the biggest schvance.  They had a whole thing where you had to call in and cast your vote, and Louis was up against, who the hell were you up against?  You had Dom Ferrara, and who else? 
[00:19:30]  And David Tell.  And David Tell.  Yeah.  And Louis Black, emerging victorious in that one.  And who presented you with the award?  Richard Belzer and Robert Klein.  Hey, can we see the award, maybe?  I'll be bringing it in.  Can you carry it around with you now?  Well, no.  They're sending it to me.  Actually, I'm going to have it sewn into my back and make a hump.  I was going to say, you should hang it around your neck.  Nice big necklace.  Why don't you put it on eBay, sell it, and then buy housing for the homeless?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy, yeah.  They'd be leaping at that. 
[00:20:00]  I might get a used lawnmower for this.  Yeah, I want to see it.  Yeah, I want to have it in my hands.  Prestigious.  It's almost like an Oscar.  It's kind of like a stalker patty gift.  Can I put it in my hands, Louis?  No, no.  Don't give it to Ovi.  He'll break it.  He can.  It's huge.  Any behind-the-scenes backstage at the award show stories?  No, you know what's stupid?  You win this thing, and then they drag your ass in front of a, you know, 
[00:20:30]  immediately they take you in, and then like 500 people is, you know,  taking photos of you.  And they're standing there going, you don't even know who I am.  People don't even know who I am, and you're flashy.  Yeah.  Well, you were the winner.  Yeah.  It's all that matters.  It's all that matters.  But that's how psychotic this culture is.  Hey, Louis.  Yeah.  What are you talking into?  I'm on this idiotic cell phone thing.  Yeah, it's really bad today.  Cell phone thing.  Will you call you back? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah, please.  I don't mean to blow you off, but it's really muffled,  and it's kind of hard to understand what you just said.  Okay.  I'll call you back.  I don't know.  Maybe I got wax in my ears.  No, no.  I know where you've got your wax.  I'll call you back.  All right.  Call us back.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There goes Louis Black.  He'll call us back.  He'll get on a better phone.  I saw the award show.  He won.  You were able to understand that?  It was just all...  Yeah, and then it kind of got a little better.  All right.  But, yeah, I saw him on there, and, of course, my pal Adam was on there, too.  We presented for the best chick on a TV series or something. 
[00:21:30]  You know, Adam's pretty close to my favorite, too.  Adam's very good.  A lot of favorites up near the most favorite comic thing.  Is it like an award show?  The most favorite comic of the Opie and Anthony show?  No, it's tough to do that, actually.  We'll piss off too many comics.  We'll piss off everyone but one person.  We don't have shallow egos like ourselves.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Yeah.  I thought Earl did a really nice job today in this broadcast from the Palisades Mall.  Yeah.  Except he gave the wrong address. 
[00:22:00]  What do you mean?  It's on Route 304, not 34.  Oh.  But it was really close.  He missed it by one.  Missed it by one.  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  Bye.  Well, that's not cool.  Anthony, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  You guys are talking about your favorite comics, right?  Yeah.  According to the Newsday, the ad for Governors.  Yeah, Brian Regan's playing there Sunday.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, but it says...  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.  Yeah, but it says Brian Regan is Opie and Anthony's favorite comic. 
[00:22:30]  Right there in Newsday.  Yeah, right there in Newsday.  And Adam Ferrara's got an ad in there, too, and it doesn't say anything about ONA's favorite  comic.  It says, Long Island's favorite from ABC's The Job.  Hey, we haven't told anyone who our favorites are.  I know.  Oh, really.  Well, and you got Valby in there, too, playing there.  All of our guys that help out our show.  So it looks like, according to the Newsday, ONA's favorite comic is Brian Regan.  It would be nice if some of these places would advertise on our show. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  I mean, you know, we need to survive ourselves here.  Dan from Hoboken wants to know where Jeff Norris fits in.  Jeff Norris, right down the middle, Anthony.  Right down the middle?  Sure.  All right.  All right.  We've got to take a break.  Jay Moore's on the line.  Yes.  We'll talk to him next, but a quick break.  Ladies, please, come on.  Yeah, help us out.  It's Friday.  We're all in a good mood.  It's nice out.  You want to win a trip to Hawaii and you think you have a nice body, get your asses down here, 
[00:23:30]  okay?  Right.  Get in the whipped cream bikini, please.  And don't worry, you don't have to, like, a lot of girls scared in the email and stuff.  They think they've got to get completely naked in front of a bunch of guys.  No, no.  Some do.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Others, no.  There's other ways to do it, so don't worry about it, okay?  Yeah, if you want to be covered up before you come out with the whipped cream, that's  fine.  If you want to put it on in front of everyone, that's fine.  Whatever you want, we'll treat you with the utmost respect.  And there's a trip to Hawaii on the line. 
[00:24:00]  It's Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Ladies, come down to WNEW anytime between 3 and 7 for your chance to win the grand prize  trip to Hawaii.  It's your body covered in our cream.  Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  102.7 WNEW.  Anthony Sam Adams.  Who doesn't like the Sam Adams?  We love the Sam Adams, and we're going to be partaking very, very soon because the boss  is very, very far away.  Where, what, both bosses? 
[00:24:30]  One's in Washington and one's in Philly.  You know, I'm going to say it right now.  Got it.  Could someone get me an ice cold Sam Adams?  Oh, I thought the bosses were here until 5.  Screw it.  Oh, make that two.  All right.  There's no reason for the bosses to be here, Anthony.  You only need to work, you only need to work three and a half days a week when the station  sucks so bad.  If Ben looks out the window and sees a bird drinking out of a puddle, he'll go, all right,  get me one, too.  It doesn't matter. 
[00:25:00]  That's good.  I like a drinking partner.  Ben's a great drinking partner, man.  Sam Adams.  Ben's getting quite the reputation lately.  That's okay.  Because there's always Psycho Mark to fall back on.  No matter how effed up you are, there's always someone a little more effed up.  Psycho Mark.  Sam Adams, the exclusive sponsor of Project Greenlight.  It's a joint effort between Project Greenlight, Miramax Films, and HBO.  The winner of this contest got to a direct his movie, which will be distributed by Miramax  Films.  Chris Moore, Matt Damon, and Ben Affleck, the executive producers of the film. 
[00:25:30]  And the winner is this young guy from Chicago named Pete Jones.  He used to sell insurance.  Now he's making movies.  The whole contest and making of movie are being filmed, and it'll become a 13-week HBO documentary  set to air earlier next week.  And it's brought to you by Sam Adams.  And let me see if I can do this.  It's pretty good with my bell using it as a bottle opener.  I'll be.  Oh, there we go.  There we go.  There we go.  Oh, you hear that?  He he he he he he. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, that is a great Sam Adams.  Go to the store, pick some up.  Go to the bar, order some.  Sam Adams.  Bopi and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest is brought to you by WhippedCreamBikini.com.  Junk gear, hot lingerie, and whipped cream bikini babes.  Need we say more?  WhippedCreamBikini.com.  David Chick.  The Radio Chick.  Weekdays, 9 to noon. 
[00:26:30]  Bopi and Anthony.  You can just tell us there was bloody child's underpants in one of their apartments.  Hopefully we're worse than serial killers.  Yeah, well, I don't understand what's so bad about team.  Guess what's in my pants?  1027-WMW.  It's the O&A Show.  FU Friday.  In progress.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Our buddy, our pal, checking in.  Jay Moore.  Jay!  Gentlemen, what is up?  Jay Moore. 
[00:27:00]  We're rocking.  FU, FU, and FU.  FU to everyone.  You know what?  I just want to get this out of the way.  As long as I'm in the ballpark, or at least a little bit above North, I'm fine with you  guys liking other comics the most.  Yeah, we're trying to figure out who we like the best.  I know you guys like me, and that's fine with me.  Oh, nice.  So I don't want you to feel any pressure like, well, we did see Jay, blah, blah.  No, as long as the ass is in the seats, I'm happy.  And you know what?  Brewer and Regan are my two favorites, so go figure. 
[00:27:30]  And you know, I'm glad you brought this up, Jay, because you know when you say how much  you love Jim Rome and stuff, and he's a great radio host, that doesn't bother us at all.  Oh, good.  Because I usually mention you guys either immediately before that or immediately after that.  Yeah, but you don't give it the push like you give it for Mr. Rome.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Well, that's okay.  I thought Kelly Ripa on live television said, make sure you listen to Jay Moore on the O.P.  and Anthony show on WNEWFM New York.  Right.  I'll tell you one thing about... 
[00:28:00]  I just thought that was like 50 million people.  I'm sorry.  I'll tell you one thing about...  You didn't mention Jim Rome's radio show.  Yeah, I'll tell you one thing about Jay Moore.  Plugs the O.P. and Anthony show the best out of any comic that appears right on our show.  There you go, baby.  By far.  So I don't mind where I come into running.  I know we all like each other, and I'm fine with that.  But you had to give Norris a little knock, didn't you?  Look at him.  Oh, white gorilla, don't steal our bottled water.  Well, you've got to say, you know, you're only kidding, though, and you love him, because  that's what we learned with you comics. 
[00:28:30]  I do love Norris.  No, I absolutely do.  God, if only that could work in real life, where you could just trash someone and just  go, but, you know, Ed, you know I love you.  Or it's anything.  You just knock on your neighbor's door, you bang his chick, and you just go, no, come on,  I love you.  Oh, Ed, remember that when we took care of that lady?  That guy wasn't even mad.  What a homo.  Well, as long as you go, I love the guy.  Ed.  Hey, Jay, four people on hold.  Jay Moore killed yesterday.  Jay Moore show last night.  F-ing funny.  Unbelievable Jay Moore last night. 
[00:29:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  It goes on and on.  Rutgers, huh?  It looks like you had a good one last night.  Yeah, they made me come back and talk some more.  Nice.  So that was real nice.  I wanted to tell you guys this bit of information before I get the Stalker Patty photos downloaded.  I wanted you guys to know that you're right, Anthony, when you say that.  I agree with you.  This is bringing Stalker Patty out of her shell.  Yeah.  I really do.  I was listening to you guys yesterday, and at Caroline's, she was walking around like a scene in a Goodfellas,  walking through the kitchen to get backstage. 
[00:29:30]  She had a little silky shirt on with no bra.  Nipples were erect the entire evening.  I didn't mean.  Go ahead, go ahead.  No, go ahead.  I didn't realize they made them in a pear shape.  Oh, no, they do.  It's called the Stalker Patty.  And she, yesterday, on this very program, entered the whipped cream bikini contest.  You can see her pictures on WNDW.com.  And, I mean, her being completely naked, just barely covered with whipped cream,  is just something you would never have thought of Stalker Patty, ever. 
[00:30:00]  It's interesting, Anthony.  The pictures are interesting.  Good, good, interesting.  I mean, I saw the whole thing coming, is what I'm trying to tell you guys.  Yeah.  Because the other night, when we were all at Caroline's, and you guys left, and Stalker Patty showed up,  and the retarded Laverne and Shirley came by.  I never saw those two up close.  That was interesting.  Oh, they really showed up at the show?  I thought you were just kidding.  No, they showed up and made it abundantly clear that they thought I was very funny 
[00:30:30]  and enjoyed shaking my hand for about 45 minutes apiece.  That's what they do.  Yeah, it was great.  And talking to me an inch from my face, even though they got glasses on, like somebody from Star Trek.  Isn't that horrible?  I think they're Trekkies when they're not following our radio show.  They're aliens.  I think one of them is John Priest, and they dress up.  But Stalker Patty wound up leaving Caroline's after giving Walter, my assistant, her phone number. 
[00:31:00]  Oh.  Whoa.  So Walter, who's black and has a huge roll of black tarp paper probably, right?  Yeah.  So Stalker Patty's not just reaching out like, eh, maybe I'll get to know somebody.  She's going to the dark woodpile.  Right into it.  There's no white in Walter's woodpile.  Right into it.  So we call the number.  It's an answering service.  Like, she does it all the time.  No way.  It's not even a number.  It's like, leave a message because I'm out, you know, banging somebody else.  She stiffed them or it was her message? 
[00:31:30]  No, it's hers.  But she's got, like, her own voicemail box for her little side pornography career.  Flapjack Sassy, her name is, I think.  Someone just checked out her pictures on WNEW.com in the whipped cream bikini,  and they say that the pictures look like the alien autopsy picture.  Yeah, alien autopsy.  Yeah, I heard somebody drop an autopsy yesterday.  Oh, my God.  So the next time you see her, you can, I mean, there's definite, there is a definite chain of events, Opie, in my opinion,  leading to the whipped cream bikini contest. 
[00:32:00]  So I'm listening at home with glee.  Yeah, but what's next for Stalker Patty?  She's done it all now.  Nope, not a gangbang.  The Stalker Patty gangbang.  That could be good.  Imagine the guy that show up for that.  So you can set the record.  Least amount of guys to show up for a gangbang.  It'll be Norton and that guy that kept getting in Brewer's face.  Dude, my friend's saying I'm being a dick.  I know you've got Brewer and Regan coming in,  so the last thing I want to do is take away from those two animals. 
[00:32:30]  Whatever you want to do.  So, gentlemen, I just wanted to let you know that Stalker Patty is throwing her phone numbers out to Blackhawks.  Nice.  Wow.  We're going to have to get to the bottom of that if Patty calls in a little while.  Has Norton seen Stalker Patty's photos?  I'm sure he has, yeah.  Yeah.  I'm sure.  We haven't heard from him yet, but I'm sure he's done.  You know why?  Because he's probably clouded the screen of his computer over with his own junk.  He's still probably using the Kimmy footage he has in his head.  Jay, for spanking purposes.  The funny thing is, too, we had two pieces of asses show up, 
[00:33:00]  and right in the middle was Stalker Patty.  So she was like the tequila shot to the two bottles of beer.  Yeah, that was funny, man.  You guys did she like the tequila.  Yeah.  That was where funny lived.  You guys pulled into the cul-de-sac, got into the funny driveway.  Yeah, we did.  The kids are playing wiffle ball.  Get them out of there.  When they pull the car forward, you can use it as a backstop.  You know, I had another line, but it went over a lot of people's heads.  We were looking at Stalker Patty's naked photos, and I'm like,  and she was next to the piece of ass Dallas.  And I look at Dallas' body, and I go, this is your naked body. 
[00:33:30]  And then I said, this is your naked body on Ritalin.  I heard that.  I thought it was very funny.  I thought it was very funny.  I thought that out of all the drugs, I thought you pulled the Trump card with Ritalin.  The funny drug.  The funny word.  Ritalin.  Sounds like giggling, kind of.  Or riddle.  CJ.  Yeah, it makes you smile just hearing it.  CJ, I learned from you.  I was trying to quickly come up with one of those wanky drugs.  And vice versa.  You learned from me.  Oh.  Damn bag.  Now it's mine. 
[00:34:00]  Hey, Dice's movie not getting good reviews today, by the way.  I thought it was getting good reviews, though.  Well, one paper's giving it a half a star, and the other's giving it like two stars.  He did it for two seconds, I think.  But I hear his part's pretty cool, though.  You don't even recognize him.  What movie?  Night at McCool's, or whatever it's called.  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's in there for a little bit.  I thought it was the one I saw at Show World.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're reading Dakotas.  Which way?  Which way, medium or upside down? 
[00:34:30]  Upside down.  I went to Show World once, and I was actually in the booth, like, cranking one out.  Uh-huh.  And the guy literally, like, not even a joke, because you're in a stall watching, you know,  85 channels of porno.  Uh-huh.  And you're supposed to, I guess, crank it out in there, you know.  Well, I figured this is as good a place as any, in other words.  And as I was, like, getting ready to climax, the guy with the mop came in, and he, like,  hit me in the back of the seat.  Just slid it under, like, those western barn doors they have.  And I was, like, oh, God. 
[00:35:00]  It's like, clean, clank, I'm clang.  And I was, like, okay, bye-bye.  He messed up your money shot.  Yeah, and I had it timed out, too.  It was a good one.  It was Ron Jeremy, and there's, like, three chicks just, like, baby birds waiting.  Yeah.  Like, baby birds.  You know, I found my limit today.  I guess this is a good point to bring this up.  Anthony and I, it's safe to say, we've seen a lot of twisted stuff being in the position we are with this radio show.  People like to send us some interesting things. 
[00:35:30]  We saw a porno before the show today while everyone else was doing normal work around here.  What was the name of it?  What was it called?  Slap Happy?  Slap Happy.  Slap Happy.  Slap Happy.  And it's, well, it opens up with a guy and a girl.  They're in a room, both, of course, naked.  The guy at attention.  And he kind of interviews her first.  I think that's important to this whole thing.  Yeah.  She was a willing participant.  She's very submissive.  Yeah, and he's calling her the C-word. 
[00:36:00]  C-word.  And you're a filthy little slut mouth, and I'm going to F your mouth.  And, you know, just really, and in between talking to her, he's slapping her in the face with his hand.  Pretty hard.  No, I don't like that stuff.  Wax.  She was getting, like, rosy cheeks.  Yeah.  It gets worse from there.  Then he grabs her hair and just, like, just, let's just say buries it.  To the point she vomits.  She chokes and vomits all over him and herself repeatedly. 
[00:36:30]  Over and over again.  Because he doesn't stop when she does that.  What did she eat?  I don't know.  It looked more like bile.  Yeah, it was disgusting.  And she was loving it.  She goes, I'm a filthy little slut.  And then, and then, to top it off, the guy writes on her forehead the C-word.  Slut.  I see the C-word.  And he's smacking her.  And then, uh...  Country?  Then there's the money shot.  And she's choking.  And she's choking. 
[00:37:00]  Like, you couldn't believe he grabs her pigtails and pulls on them like he's popping a wheelie  on a bicycle.  And she just goes, blah, and pukes all over herself and him.  We all took a peek.  Ben refused to look.  He's looking at his computer screen, just screaming, turn it off, turn it off.  Turn it off.  And then he's smacking her in the face with his bat.  This is like, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop.  No, turn it.  And you know what?  I found my limit today.  It just was...  Yeah, that's my limit, too, because I saw one of this guy, Black, the house that Black 
[00:37:30]  built.  That's his name.  His last name is Black.  Yeah.  And that's like his...  I guess he's like a really big porno guy, but every chick there was like...  They had like hot chicks, like Joe Kelly and Stephanie Swift.  And they were like getting it from behind, but like the guy would be having his hands in  her mouth, like pulling her mouth back.  Yeah.  And spitting in their faces.  And I'm like, you know what?  I'm not really an axe murderer, so I'm going to turn it.  Yeah, this guy was doing some weird stuff to the chick, too.  He had like... 
[00:38:00]  He made her face the camera lens, and he was behind her, and he grabbed her mouth like  it was a horse bit going in her mouth, and just pulled back.  Yeah, I don't like that.  And he's like, look at your slut mouth, you see.  Look at...  And it's like, yeah, I'm not into that.  Michael Marcus.  I think that was your birthday present, though.  Yeah, thanks, Steve.  It was.  You're very welcome.  We cracked it right open there in the office.  Yeah, Steve from foundrymusic.com brought it in.  And, Jay, what I told the guys, if he's bringing in Slap Happy, I wonder what videos he has 
[00:38:30]  at home that he's not brave enough to bring in front of us.  Yeah, what's he holding back?  What is he holding back?  Somebody said Slap Film.  That was funny yesterday with Stalker Patty.  Oh, yeah, the scene right before the end of Slap Film.  The end of Slap Film made me wet my pants.  What's what it looked like?  Right before you plunged the knife in her chest.  There's six Korean guys with hoods on, cranking them out.  Oh, God.  No, I heard.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I hope you just heard.  I don't know.  When's Brewer coming in?  I don't know.  You know. 
[00:39:00]  You know the deal.  Which way?  Which way?  Right.  Which way?  Medium?  Nah, nah.  Which way?  Medium or well done?  Which way?  Bosco or you bet?  Which way?  Cream cheese or more pizza?  Which way?  Which way?  Forty more pounds or forty-five?  I can't even breathe under this jacket.  I'm a superhero.  I should go on in a wetsuit and a cape. 
[00:39:30]  Quick, would you?  All right, Jay, we've got to take a break.  No, gentlemen, thanks for the time.  Thanks for the weekend, man.  It was really good seeing you guys.  Cool.  Hey, Jay, call me at home because we've got a really good idea that we wanted to throw by you.  Nice.  No, I'm totally serious, all right?  Okay.  When do you get a chance?  Put me at home because I lost my phone book.  You've got to give me your number again.  Okay.  Bye.  All right.  There's an open letter from the director of Slap Happy here.  A few weeks ago, a video was sent to a news agency for review with a press release below following a week or so later. 
[00:40:00]  I have talked to some of the participants and found the content of this tape was consensual.  They are people who evidently enjoy both giving and receiving the treatment portrayed in this video.  That's why I made sure we said that the guy who interviewed the girl should be completely into this.  Then he says, an open letter to all whores, seas, and sluts from Alec James Heidel, director of Slap Happy.  Be warned that I am hunting you down one by one.  When I catch you or when you are stupid enough to let me hire you, I will ream your throats, pump your pretty faces, and bruise your tonsils. 
[00:40:30]  The industry has been too soft for too long.  I'm sick of all these nice girls doing nice things on camera.  This is porn, you bitches.  You're supposed to be degraded in manners most foul.  That is why Slap Happy was created, to keep you sluts in line.  I took down 12 of you in volume one, and Extreme Associates is putting out one volume a month.  So beware if you don't want to get slapped, choked, spit on, verbally assaulted, or orally violated.  Do not get on your knees in front of me. 
[00:41:00]  Thank you.  See you in hell.  Alec James Heidel.  Ha, ha, ha, casting call.  Wow.  But, hey, he's getting phone calls from that letter.  Man.  All right.  With that, we've got to take a break.  You know, we ought to do something like that quickly.  We ought to get a phone line and just advertise something quickly that just most degrading,  that no one could possibly answer this ad, and see the kind of calls we get. 
[00:41:30]  Set that up, Rick.  Make it happen.  Rick, to you.  Do the magic, Rick.  Comment.  Let's go to the F.U. line as we take a break.  Thanks for calling, and this is the Opie and Anthony F.U. Friday line.  I want to send a big f***ing you to my ex-girlfriend from Harvard Law School.  She's obviously too good for my f***ing blue-collar ass, but whatever, bitch.  Beat it.  I can't stand you.  Rotten hell.  Next message.  Yeah, this is Shawnee Love.  I'd like to give a big f***ing you to Lennox Lewis for screwing up the whole heavyweight division 
[00:42:00]  and getting knocked out by some Joe Blow bump from your backyard.  Now you ain't gonna fight Tyson, and you just f***ed up the whole division.  Thanks a lot, you shookey bastard.  Next message.  F*** you.  You wife of mine who have sucked the life out of me for over 20 years, you miserable bitch.  End of message.  Hey, this is John Velby.  They call me Dr. Dirty, because I'm a f***ing ass.  F***er, but you're still listening to Opie and Anthony on 102.7 N.E.W., yeah. 
[00:42:30]  Hey, Anthony, Backlash is this Sunday on Pay-Per-View.  We're talking about WWF, of course.  We had the lovely Stephanie McMahon on a few days ago.  Yes, yesterday, I believe that was.  And these guys, was it yesterday?  Yeah.  This week has flown by.  Sure did.  We shoved a lot of crap down your throats this week, guys.  Hope you appreciated it.  That's one way to put it.  Just think, I mean, we had the real Greg Brady, Barry Williams in here. 
[00:43:00]  We had Buzz from Home Alone.  You forget all the stuff we had.  All the girls for the whipped cream bikini.  Wonderful.  But Opie and all the fine comics and Brian Reardon coming in in a little while.  But, yeah, Pay-Per-View Sunday.  It's going to be a good one.  This Sunday, Backlash.  Of course, everybody remembers the aftermath of WrestleMania.  Who will survive the backlash of events?  Spin out of control right now.  Everything's out of control in the WWF, as per usual.  We can only watch and hope for an end to the chaos that follows us.  Castrol GTX presents WWF Backlash live and only on pay-per-view this Sunday. 
[00:43:30]  The new tag team champions, the Brothers of Destruction, The Undertaker and Kane,  set out to show WWF champion Stone Cold Steve Austin  and intercontinental champ Triple H what it's like to be a badass.  The four most dominant forces in the WWF  could have waged war in a historic tag team match  in which all three titles on the line.  Mr. McMahon, Vince, to you and me,  feels that his son, new WCW owner Shane McMahon,  had been trying to recruit over the Big Show and other WWF superstars 
[00:44:00]  in an effort to end Shane O'Mac's campaign.  Vince booked the Big Show and Shane in a last-man-standing match at Backlash.  So that ought to be good, watching Shane run around like a nut.  Also, watch Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit battle in a 30-minute ultimate submission match.  Plus, Chris Jericho and William Regal go head-to-head in the Duchess of Queensberry match,  whatever that is.  Don't miss WWF Backlash live this Sunday, 8 p.m. only on pay-per-view.

[00:44:30]  Hour, hour, hour, hour, by O.P. and Anthony.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting.  This is 1027-WNEW, New York. 
[00:45:00]  It's the O&A Show, 212-757-1027.  I was wondering what Green Day was up to lately.  That's not Green Day.  This isn't the new Green Day tune?  The Living End.  Roll on.  Have a Green Day, what a bit.  I miss those guys.  He kind of sounds a little Green Day.  A little bit, a little bit.  Hey, Lewis.  What do you mean, Lewis?  I'm Gary Coleman today.  Oh, no way.  I dialed back about 40 times. 
[00:45:30]  You would think winning a comedy award would enable you to get right through to the show.  Oh, no, absolutely not.  Nothing changes.  It's the same river of dung.  Well, you could put that award up on the mantle of the fireplace in your new expensive star-like apartment.  Mm-hmm.  Right?  Who wants a happy Lewis Black anyway?  Well, you know, certainly, I'm not happy.  You know, winning this award, it might make you too happy.  It might make you a whole comedy thing. 
[00:46:00]  I was happy.  They announced my name.  I was happy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I had to, you know, and it was literally, I've got to say, it was like somebody blew my head off.  You know what I mean?  Why is that?  It came as a complete shock.  Well, no, you deserve it.  You're a funny guy.  There you go.  You know, but it did.  I was absolutely, I have to say, I was completely and utterly shocked.  And then I just was like irritated because now I, you know, I've got to keep being funny.  It's exhausting.  There's a lot of pressure. 
[00:46:30]  Now you're voted the funniest.  Now you've got to be funny.  But now you, now you go to the clubs and they go, you know, he's, he won that award.  He sucks.  He's really sucks.  See, and I, we decided not to win any more awards.  Too much pressure.  Well, no, I, but the main reason I called was to say, I really thank you guys.  You were a big help.  Hey, Lewis, it was only Dom Arara and David Tell.  Come on.  Unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  We have to put other people down to make ourselves feel better.  The other.  It's so inadequate. 
[00:47:00]  But actually you should put, Dom is coming to town and you should get him on the show.  Is he?  Yeah.  We'll think about it.  Yeah, he's, you'll like him.  Did he come in second or third?  Uh, I have no idea.  They don't even tell us anything.  They should because it's a phone, uh, phone poll.  So someone had to come in last.  Nah, I don't know.  They don't tell us.  And you don't care because you won.  I won.  I won.  And, and I'm still, and it's still, nothing changes.  Yeah.  Hey, Lewis, what do you think of, uh, Bob Carey?  The little Vietnam. 
[00:47:30]  Bob Carey.  I mean, uh.  Oh, yeah.  Nice job, eh?  The little Vietnam thing that's going on.  Oh, Carey, yeah.  Uh, what did I say?  Uh, Bob.  Oh.  He's unbelievable.  I'm an idiot.  Yeah, now, now he's in, uh, Vietnam, you know, years ago.  And he got this, uh, medal for, uh, his action.  He kept it hidden.  And, and now he's coming out because the story was going to break that, that there were a bunch of women and children and old men in this village that they just, uh, killed everybody in.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it wasn't like me lied.  No.  It was different. 
[00:48:00]  Right, it was totally different.  Yeah.  You know what, you know, people, I have no problem with this because somehow people have seemed to have forgotten how horrific Vietnam was.  Yeah.  Like when they, when the guys first came back from Vietnam and you were getting, uh, movies about Vietnam, it kind of portrayed it as a sick, twisted thing.  Yeah.  And then as time goes on now, it's being portrayed different.  And people, people forgot that, yeah, a lot of people died.  It was a war.  And a lot of innocent people.  Are you trying to say they're glamorizing Vietnam a little bit, Anthony? 
[00:48:30]  I think time is kind of putting a little bit of cushion on it.  Well, they made the Titanic look all nice and happy.  Now it's a carnival ride.  And before you know it, they'll have the Da Nang slide where you slide down into a meat grinder or something.  Lewis, did you hear us talking about that?  There's an actual Titanic slide that you could rent for your kid's birthday party.  Yeah.  It's a huge blow-up thing like you would see at an amusement park, one of those big slides.  Yeah.  And it's the Titanic going down.  It's half sunk.  It looks like it's sinking into the grass. 
[00:49:00]  And the kids climb up this huge ladder and get onto the, what is the deck,  and slide down as they bounce off the stacks and slide to the bottom.  If you just add time to a tragedy, it becomes a carnival ride.  They were trying to make a disco out of Auschwitz.  The Auschwitz disco.  No joke.  Yeah, that was in the paper a few months back.  Well, they've got those places.  They've got two restaurants in, uh...  I mean, you're in the disco in Auschwitz, and all of a sudden they turn on the smoke machine. 
[00:49:30]  You're going to clear out the place.  Well, have you been to, you know, a dance club?  They like the smoke machines.  Well, you know, they got a, uh, the Koreans have a restaurant where you eat in jail cells.  Oh, yeah, I did see that.  No way.  Yeah, of course.  What do you mean, no way?  Yeah, it's like a little prison environment.  Well, you know, you read that thing on the air about that guy who's basically attracting  women to come, you know, I'm going to shove my patooter down your hookah.  Yeah, right. 
[00:50:00]  You know, and you go, he responds to that.  I mean, he gets people to respond.  And that there's, you ought to put a line like that.  And as soon as they come in the door, we take them off for psychiatric care.  After we have our way with them.  Exactly.  But what is this jail thing about?  You just go there to eat.  Yeah, you go into a restaurant and it's, it's like a, the theme of it is a prison.  Yeah.  And you can sit in the cells and, uh, the, uh, waitstaff looks like guards.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then they slide your tray.  Yeah.  No way.  They treat you like a prisoner. 
[00:50:30]  That's pretty bizarre.  There's a little spin on the whole Jekyll and Hyde, Planet Hollywood.  Nice little theme restaurant, right?  Right.  And then I got another one where they just, it's all Nazi memorabilia.  Now, that would be interesting.  You know.  You hail the waiter by, uh, giving them the SIG high.  You know, it's just unbelievable.  It's unbelievable.  They have a restaurant in Formosa that's on top of a, uh, uh, a, uh, what do you call it?  A sewage treatment plant.  I mean, it's just, but you know, you know, now it's just, it's completely, you know, anything. 
[00:51:00]  There's nothing I wouldn't believe anymore.  Like if somebody approaches me with something that they've seen or is happening, like these restaurants or just anything.  I have to believe it because people have gotten really twisted.  Well, here we go.  This is where, where we're going to get Lewis a little pissed off.  Well, we did a whole bit on the NRA, uh, theme restaurants.  They're thinking of putting in Times Square.  This is a real story.  Oh, I know.  Let's get Chuck Heston in there.  I know.  They didn't do it, though.  Martin Luther King Krabbley.  They just have people that have been shot. 
[00:51:30]  They stopped them from doing it, though.  It's one of our best bits ever.  J-F-K-F-C-T-C.  That'd be great.  We had, what, the Ruby Ridge ribs?  We had a whole mess of them.  I mean, an NRA-themed restaurant?  I totally believe it could work.  Well, it would have worked.  Yeah.  You know, they just weren't going to let them in.  You know, if it would have worked, they would have been pouring it.  Of course.  For God's sake, they eat at the Olive Garden. 
[00:52:00]  That they just want to call that Buckets of Crap.  Oh, boy, my Italian family.  It makes you, if you're an Italian and you watch that in, it must make you suicidal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Hey, my uncle is in.  What kind of idiot creates a restaurant that makes Italian food?  Italian food, it's too much for the American palate.  Oh, these people panic.  Ooh.  Tomato sauce.  Make it milder.  Poor sugar. 
[00:52:30]  It's true.  It is.  I watch those commercials.  It's like, my uncle's here from Sicily.  So we took him to the Olive Garden.  Guys, you'd shoot you in the back of the head with a small caliber weapon.  Exactly.  What's wrong with Grandma?  She's not cooking anymore.  Yeah.  And what blows me away is when you do walk through Times Square, which is a rare thing,  and you see these rubes from all over the Midwest and stuff.  They come to New York, and you see them sitting in places like the Olive Garden and Fridays,  restaurants they could go to back in Omaha.  And Applebee's and Chili's and that jumbo Chevy's, which is, you know, makes, you know, 
[00:53:00]  they were yelling about that Walt Disney thing at the end of the block,  and then they put up the Chevy sign where they, and that's just, why don't they just say,  why don't they just put diarrhea?  Yeah, they don't want to go off the beaten path of Times Square to maybe find some kind  of a restaurant unique to New York, something they might get a new taste from.  No, they go to the theme restaurants and stuff they could get back in the...  It's like, why go to New York City?  East Bum F. 
[00:53:30]  Save the airfare and the hotel fee, you know?  But who'd have thought that the thing that would attract tourists to New York City would  be that we would turn it into a giant mall?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No.  Times Square is a huge outdoor mall.  It is.  That's it.  You know?  What happened to the smut?  It's just a matter of time before they get rid of the, you know, the cars.  They need the space.  No, they're not.  They're going to need the space.  I mean, you walk around there on a Friday night, I mean, it's like, it's ridiculous. 
[00:54:00]  Half the people are in the street because there's no room on the sidewalk anymore.  No, it's unbelievable.  James has something.  And they're all buying garbage.  James has something.  They're all buying garbage in their hands.  James, you're on with Louis Black.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  You guys, I don't know if you heard about it, in Vietnam, you guys can take a tour of  the tunnels at the VCon, Doug.  Isn't that right?  Yeah, you can hang out inside there.  I think it costs like 20 bucks or whatever the charging be now.  20 bucks, you take a tour of the tunnels that the VC were using to kill the soldiers. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, in the end, they give you a bowl of rice.  Yeah, what is that like?  20 bucks with fish heads.  We know of a guy that went over there and did the tour, but he refuses to talk about it  on our radio show.  All right, guys.  Later.  All right, man.  Later, man.  But he says it was incredible and it was like intricate.  They had like hospitals on the ground and learning centers.  It was just ridiculous what they had going on under the ground.  Yeah.  I'm sure it's all commercialized, though, where you drive in in a little Mr. Toad's 
[00:55:00]  Wild Ride type car, hooping your little horn to some music.  It's a small, killed, imperialistic pig world after all.  Yeah, the franchise thing just sucks, though.  Well, guys, I have to actually run.  I'm at Overland College.  You want to, tonight you're there?  I'm there.  I'm actually right here right now and I've got to go talk to the students.  Okay.  Oh, you're not playing anything?  You're just telling us you're there?  No, I'm just, I don't.  It's just the only reason I'm getting off the phone. 
[00:55:30]  That's what they pay their tuition for.  All right.  So, you know, so that I can come there and annoy them.  Lewis can speak to them.  And what's nuts is every university I go to now, when I go to perform at the university,  all the guys come up and go, I heard John Owen, hey, I don't listen to you on the Internet.  Well, yeah.  Ah, yeah.  We appreciate that.  All over the place.  That's syndication underground.  You know?  Cool.  The Internet's great for listening to us or trading the bomb-making secrets, whatever.  It's a great thing.  Yeah.  But I really did call up to thank you guys.  You guys, I mean it. 
[00:56:00]  Come see us soon, Lewis.  I will.  We're going to have girls in whipped cream bikinis all next week, so come on down.  I'll be fine.  All right.  All right, Lewis.  See you next week.  Later, man.  Definitely, man.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  There he goes, Lewis Black.  There he goes.  He won the American Comedy Award.  I guess it was like a viewer's choice thing.  Yeah.  You know?  Congrats, Lewis.  And, you know, we didn't really help him that much.  No, we said it a couple of times.  I don't even want to take the credit for it.  I think we mentioned it like twice.  He earned it.  He earned it on his own.  He's a funny guy.  Whether you see him live out at the comedy clubs, I mean, he puts 110% in it, and you think 
[00:56:30]  he's going to have a goddamn hemorrhage in the middle of the show or on The Daily Show.  He's really funny.  Very intelligent.  He mentioned syndication on the ground.  It is happening like crazy.  The email we're getting on a daily basis from all over the country is getting insane.  Country?  World.  World.  All over the world.  World.  Faggots in France.  Listening to us.  I just want to thank the people that are spreading, like, our bits and stuff like it's a virus  all over the place.  Virus good, yes.  It's bizarre. 
[00:57:00]  I mean, people are like, hey, you know, I turned on Friends in West Virginia, you know,  I told them where they can find O&A bits on the internet, and you guys are putting up  new bits all the time.  It might not sound like a lot when you hear from a guy from West Virginia somewhere saying,  yeah, I turned five of my friends on to the show.  Yeah.  But then you go to every city and every state and how many people and all over the world.  Before you know it, there's maybe 25 people listening.  You know, it adds up to quite a few people.  It's just cool that people are out there spreading, you know, the word of the show. 
[00:57:30]  Thank you.  We don't talk about it often, but thanks, guys, for helping us out.  I love you, Lee.  Well, that's true.  I mean, we don't care if our bits are on Naps or anything.  No.  Let them rock.  Unfortunately, the company cares about the whole syndication thing.  That's why we don't want to know how you do it to keep doing it.  What's wrong?  Earl.  Earl.  Yo.  Earl Douglas.  How's it going at Palisades Mall?  Things are going great here.  We are in Lot 34 at Palisades Mall in Nyack, New York, which is exit 12, right off the New York State Thruway. 
[00:58:00]  We're right in front of the Bed Bath & Beyond and the Rainforest Cafe, actually the back entrance to both places.  And it's right off of 59.  And we're going to be here for a couple more minutes handing out WOW stickers.  What time do you get there, Earl?  Earl?  We got here about 3 o'clock.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  A lot of people showing up for their WOW stickers?  Yes.  Everyone's saying, well, we don't come up here enough, which is pretty much why we came up here. 
[00:58:30]  So, thank God, he's back to the old Earl again.  Earl.  Everyone's saying we don't go up there enough, right?  So, why don't you give it a little extra effort and say maybe another half hour.  It's Friday.  It's beautiful out.  You know, give people a chance to find you and stuff.  What do you think?  What do you say, Earl?  No, I mean, hey, it's your show, guys.  I was told to stay an hour, an hour and a half.  I stayed an hour, hour and a half.  All right.  You want to stay another 20 minutes?  What do you say?  Yeah, we'll stay until five if you want us to.  Yeah.  All right.  We don't get up there often. 
[00:59:00]  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  Well, I totally understand.  All right, cool.  So, you'll be handing out WOW stickers at the Palisades Mall until, what, five o'clock?  Until five o'clock.  We're in Lot 34, right in front of the Bed Bath & Beyond and also the Rainforest Cafe.  All right, Earl.  Thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  There he goes.  Speaking of WOW, Ricky has something.  Ricky, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I own a professional wrestling company out in Jersey, and WB11 this morning came out 
[00:59:30]  to our school and did a special on us.  And so we had WOW up all over the walls, O&A Army.  So the reporter walked in, and he was a goofball.  He's like, well, we're not going to shoot that.  We're not going to get that on.  We know what you're trying to do.  So halfway through the show, the guy out in the truck goes, I'm a big fan of O&As.  He's like, let's come up with a good idea and rib the host.  So what we did is we named one of our wrestlers the Cleveland Steamer.  So he comes up, and he's going to work out with this kid and take his bump, and he goes,  and coming up next, the Cleveland Steamer. 
[01:00:00]  And he takes the kid, and he throws him in the ropes, and he's yelling, I'm going to get  the steamer.  He's hot.  He's steamy, but he's not me.  And he had his WOW bumper stickers all over the guys in the ring and everything, and  the guy in the truck airing it.  So he got WOW on the air for about 25 minutes this morning, O&A Army up on the wall.  You definitely did, because we're getting a lot of people calling in saying they saw  that this morning.  Yeah, I'm going to send you guys the tape.  Hey, Ricky, that's great.  You guys rule.  Have a great weekend.  Thank you.  I can't see that.  That's funny. 
[01:00:30]  Cleveland Steamer.  That's funny.  You know, that's a good idea.  Yeah, yeah.  Because, you know, we only do like four hours of radio, and there's, you know, people are  checking out other radio and TV and stuff.  Yeah.  You guys should get on other shows just using, like, obscure references from our show.  From this show names or whatever.  It'll make people just chuckle.  That would be funny if you heard a, you know, hey, they call me Cleveland Steamer.  Yeah, and you're driving around, you know, over the weekend, and, you know, you're listening  to a traditional talk station, and all of a sudden they, you know, come up with an obscure 
[01:01:00]  reference as their name or something.  That could be fun.  Yeah.  I have a dog, um, he's a, he's a crumpet muncher, and I don't know what to do about  him.  Right.  I'm Sandy Kane.  Yeah, exactly.  Ooh.  I just keep going, ooh, in the middle of your, uh, call.  That could be fun.  It would be very fun.  Dave, what's going on?  Guys, I was with Ricky this morning.  Yeah?  Um, and I actually had it on tape, and I was going to play that spot for you where he was  calling him the Cleveland Steamer.  You got it right now?  Yeah, if you want to hear the audio. 
[01:01:30]  Uh, we would love to.  I mean, it was hysterical.  I had the bumper sticker, the wow bumper sticker on my chest.  And were you one of the wrestlers in the ring?  Yeah, I'm one of the trainers.  Oh, cool.  And I had the bumper sticker on my chest, and it was like in almost every shot.  Right.  And when he was taking on the kid we called the Cleveland Steamer, we put the wow sticker  on his chest so it would be on the camera.  You know who would love that video is Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, we got it to him.  All right, let's play the audio.  Make sure it's loud enough so we can hear it.  Okay, give me one second here.  Here we go.  All right. 
[01:02:00]  A little low, right?  In Garfield, New Jersey at Wrestler Training School.  Take it away.  You ready?  Come on.  Come on.  This is the Cleveland Steamer.  The Cleveland Steamer.  I'm not steaming.  I'll tell you something, buddy.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Well, I'm not done with you, Steamer.  You like that?  I'm not done with you, Steamer. 
[01:02:30]  Hey, that's pretty funny.  Great job.  Yeah, definitely, man.  Oh, we had to do it.  We got O&A Army on the wall.  Wow, on the wall.  Everywhere.  It is greatly appreciated.  You guys know that.  You got it, guys.  Hey, thank you.  No problem.  All right.  There you go.  Above and beyond the call of duty.  A lot of girls showing up today, Rick.  Another girl with huge boobs just walked down the wall.  Brian Regan is like dazing at good news.  Oh, no.  Hey, Brian.  Brian, what the hell's going on here today? 
[01:03:00]  I'm out here watching.  Hey, Scott, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I know you don't talk about it too much, and it's good that you don't.  I'm a syndication underground listener out of Richmond, Virginia.  I was born and lived in Westchester, moved down here for graduate school, and I found  it like after two weeks of searching.  This is back when you guys were hammering the SI Live because of that whole thing.  But on average per day, there are at least like 250 people listening underground.  Oh, cool.  There are two guys that do it most of all, and then there are couples that get like 10 
[01:03:30]  or 20, but at least like right now, there's like 130 on one of them and 120 on the other.  So you guys are listened to a lot.  I mean, a lot of it has to do with people at work.  Like after five, the number dropped.  Yeah.  But still, there are a lot of people that listen to it, and everybody that I come in contact  around here, I try to tell them and let them know where it is.  Yeah, we love that grassroots stuff, man.  All right, man.  You guys are doing great, and you get me through my grad school.  Thanks, Scott.  Thanks a lot.  In Richmond?  Yeah, Richmond, Virginia.  Richmond, Virginia checking in. 
[01:04:00]  Brian Regan!  Hey!  What's up, Brian?  You like out there, what's going on out there?  I don't even walk in.  I thought you came with, I didn't recognize you because I was just looking real fast,  and I thought you came with the girl with the big boobs, and then all of a sudden I see  you just stop in the middle of the hall like, what the F is going on here today?  I just kind of walked down without anybody like really escorting me.  Real good security here.  Just scroll right in.  We're doing our whipped cream bikini thing, so these girls are coming in, and they're 
[01:04:30]  putting on nothing but whipped cream bikinis, and then we put their pictures up on the  internet, and the listeners are going to get to vote who wins, and then the winner goes  to Hawaii, so it's a pretty good prize.  There's always something cool happening.  Last time I was here, you were having, I don't know what it was called, but it was...  Help us out, because this show has become a blur.  Oh, it was the ass contest?  Oh, it was the best ass contest.  Yeah, I think it was the ass contest.  There were women coming in to repose because they were unhappy with the photos that were 
[01:05:00]  on the internet, so they were like getting them re-shot.  We're going to run out of things to like do a contest going.  Just start with internal organs.  Best spleen contest.  Come on in, girls.  Best spleen.  Oh, my gosh.  Sounds like a judge by default.  They're like coming in and like getting their photos taken right next to me.  I'm like, I would have to vote for both candidates here.  Yes.  Everyone's a finalist.  Yes.  And we'll just make excuses, because it's supposed to be a whipped cream bikini contest. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  We barely used any whipped cream yesterday.  There was like two dots.  Look at this one.  Like a triangle.  That's a whipped cream bikini contest.  Hey, what is that?  That isn't even enough for some pudding at home.  Imagine that being like an ad for Cool Whip, you know?  I'd buy Cool Whip.  It's a dollop.  A dollop's worth it.  Yeah.  Hey, two more girls have just showed up.  Nice.  See?  They might be clients.  What?  We always got to be careful.  How many girls do that? 
[01:06:00]  Sometimes we get these really hot media buyers coming by.  They want to, you know, say hi to us, and they give them the tour.  Sometimes we slip, hey, you're here for the best piece contest?  No, we're here to maybe buy advertising, guys.  We were here.  The sales guy looks at us, thanks.  That's $200,000.  We won't see.  Welcome.  Bend over.  Right.  Yeah, we wear many hats, Brian.  Yeah.  We just got to make sure we know who we're talking to. 
[01:06:30]  I'm going to try to pop on the camera, I hope.  So some of these girls, if they want to come in, introduce themselves, and maybe show some  of their goods.  Well, you know, that's usually a good idea, but Brian Regan, he likes to work clean, and  I don't think he wants to see it.  No, I've never put up a fuss with what's going on in here.  I love it, man.  All right.  Well, we have to take a break.  We do?  Yeah, Brian Regan is here, though.  Brian, real fast.  Rascals Friday and Saturday?  Ocean Township, Rascals Friday, West Orange Saturday, and then Governor's for two shows 
[01:07:00]  on Sunday.  I'm going to the Governor's shows.  Oh, cool, man.  So we'll see if the Governor's on Long Island on Sunday.  All right.  We'll be back with Brian Regan.

[01:09:30]  So we have...  How many contestants do we have, Rick?  We've got three that are out there.  Three?  As soon as they get naked, why don't we bring them in?  All right.  You know, it's one thing to talk to them with their clothes on.  Yeah.  Just have them rip their clothes off and run in here as quickly as possible.  That's what Mendy did the other day.  Oh, but not Mendy.  That was horrific.  She weighs a lot.  She's a very big girl.  But she likes that, though.  She entered the contest.  Well, why don't you show Brian?  I'll show you her picture.  Yeah, I'll show you a quick picture of Mendy and Brian, who has nothing bad to say about 
[01:10:00]  anyone.  Watch what he says about Mendy.  What?  I'm sure it'll be very nice.  Of course.  What is her name?  Mendy?  Mendy.  Okay.  See, there you go.  There's Mendy.  Yeah.  It's a nice, you know, bikini.  Did a good job.  Yeah.  See?  And she's eating it.  There.  Look at that.  All right.  Nothing to say, huh? 
[01:10:30]  Do you find...  I admire anybody who wants to, you know, join a competition.  You know?  I love Brian.  They're out there.  Do their best.  All right.  Well...  Do you find that attractive, Brian?  What do you think?  You know, it's a positive thing.  Forever.  You're the diplomat.  I love their career forward, you know?  All right, Brian.  Why don't we show them another picture of that, Anthony?  How about, I don't know, Stalker Patty?  Stalker Patty?  Yeah, sure. 
[01:11:00]  All right.  Let me just pop her up here.  Uh-huh.  And you can take a look at Stalker Patty.  There's Stalker Patty, Brian.  What do you think?  What do you think of that?  If you could just replay my comments from before.  Yeah?  Look at that one.  Yeah.  That's a hot picture.  Right?  Is that literally a...  That's a cherry down here, isn't it?  It is a cherry down there.  And literally it is, because she is a 46-year-old virgin.  That's a 46-year-old virgin.  Yeah, virgin.  She's saving herself.  Saving herself for the right guy.  But there she is, naked. 
[01:11:30]  You've got to respect that.  She's not naked.  She's got cool whipped cream.  Well, a little whipped cream.  Right, right.  You're right.  And you can check out these pictures on WNEW.com.  And you ever watch Survivor?  I've seen it back and forth.  You know what?  Kimmy.  Kimmy from Survivor.  That's her right there.  Yeah.  Those pictures were on Extra last night.  Really?  So don't get naked around here today, Brian.  Don't get naked.  The naked bus thing?  That was us.  Yeah, I know.  I saw that on...  Dateline.  Dateline.  They don't even mention us.  Yeah.  They don't even mention us, right? 
[01:12:00]  Oh, my gosh.  We always treat radio people like the bastard scum that we are.  Let's get us a reaction for one of the fine-looking ladies, Anthony.  All right.  I want to see if his reaction changes at all.  Who do you suggest I pop up?  I would go with Jessie.  All right.  Let me pop young Jessie up, who just turned 20.  She's one of the ones that just came out of the ranks of the teen.  There's even in the back there, huh?  Yeah, see?  There's a whipped cream in the back. 
[01:12:30]  Well, you have to make a thong out of it, Brian.  That would be silly if there wasn't whipped cream there.  Yeah, this is a whipped cream bikini contest.  See?  Look at that.  We try hard around here, Brian.  Look at that.  Laughing at our contest.  No, no.  It's just I wasn't expecting the whipped cream in the back.  Well, Brian, it would be a little goofy if there wasn't whipped cream back there.  This is a bikini contest.  I bet it would be completely silly.  You'd be going, what kind of bathing suit is that? 
[01:13:00]  Bravo.  That's so Brian enjoys the pictures he's seen so far.  And he enjoys all the ladies of different shapes and sizes.  The grand prize is a trip to Hawaii, Brian.  Man, that's great.  So later, it's going down.  You can come down next week as well, but we would love to see you today, right?  Tim, real fast.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I listen in Cleveland, and I got one little laptop up in the front of the store here,  and I got two baby monitors running so I can listen in the back.  My boss has no clue.  I won't quit my job just because of you guys, man. 
[01:13:30]  I don't think I'm going to get a chance to listen anywhere else.  So you're listening to Syndication Underground in Cleveland?  Absolutely.  Oh, man.  Hey, look at that.  You guys rule, man.  Take it easy.  Did you see us on Extra last night?  Nope.  The photos of Kimmy?  No.  I saw him on the Internet, but no, I didn't see him on Extra.  Yeah, Extra grabbed the pictures from us and then used us pretty good.  Nice.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Thanks.  Brian, you will not be getting into a whipped cream bikini today?  Well, I'm going to see how the first few contestants go.  Yeah. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah.  All right.  It was intriguing.  We never said that guys can't be involved, so hello.  Hi.  Who are you?  Cheryl.  Cheryl.  And you came down for the whipped cream bikini contest.  Great.  What do you got on right now?  Pretty much.  Wow.  It's like naked.  What is that?  Just a sweater.  Oh, you took all your clothes off.  Under there.  Okay.  Brian, what do you think of Cheryl?  It's a nice sweater.  I'm looking forward to seeing your contestant number one. 
[01:14:30]  There you go.  You're a little shy?  Is that it?  Yeah.  Well, I was sitting out there for a while.  My jeans are tight, so now I have like an imprint of my jeans.  No, that's...  Well, see, we understand that.  Thanks.  It's all taken into consideration.  Brian, would you like to iron that out possibly?  That's not a problem.  I mean, we don't rule against any jean creases.  No, you know what?  Because you're a real, live girl.  It's not like some kind of a penthouse playboy thing where they don't have the jean marks.  We like the jean marks.  And she's got the big boobs working there, Angel. 
[01:15:00]  Yes.  Very nice.  See?  Very nice body.  There you go.  What do you mean you wish?  Sweater.  It could be a little bigger.  You think?  Well, we can't tell.  Oh, you got one of those pierced.  Oh, yeah.  A little door knocker.  It's so funny.  She like shows a little and covers right back up.  You got to cover back up.  Yeah.  What was that?  Did I see something?  No, all I see is a sweater.  We see bits and pieces.  I must have been imagining that.  You got to put it together in your head like a Rubik's Cube.  And you're done getting the bits and pieces from you.  I think Cheryl's lovely.  Thank you.  And Rick, you going to do the honors?  We're going to do it right now. 
[01:15:30]  Very nice.  Look at that.  All right.  Thank you, Cheryl.  Well, that's a short sweater.  Oh, look at that.  You see that?  I was saying a brand name for the whipped cream before.  I noticed you're going with a generic brand.  I don't know.  Cool Whip.  Cool Whip.  It's Ready Whip for all your nude girl covering needs.  So, Brian, what have you been up to?  Yeah.  Now that you know what we've been up to.  I want to wish everybody out there a very happy and healthy administrative assistance week. 
[01:16:00]  It used to be called secretaries.  Yes, but that's politically incorrect these days.  Yeah.  So it's Administrative Assistance Week.  Administrative Assistance Week.  But what kind of phrase is that?  I mean, are you supposed to say that to somebody?  Happy Administrative Assistance Week!  How did you know?  Yeah, you get them a nice card from Hallmark, you know.  You have been such a wonderful administrative assistant.  Why don't they just get rid of the whole thing, you know, instead of trying to update it with 
[01:16:30]  a politically correct term that is ludicrous, you know.  And how do you fit that on a card?  I know.  Secretary's Day was kind of, you know, goofy right there as it was, but now...  It was a day, and then they switched it to a week.  A week?  Because it was like on a Wednesday, and then they figured like if you blew it on Wednesday...  Oh, here we go.  Now, what do you got on there?  I have, underneath the panel, I'm naked. 
[01:17:00]  I have the little nipple covers.  Yes, you do.  Brian, what happened to your little bit?  I was kind of reaching.  Hang on one second, lovely woman.  So, the Administrative Assistance Week, if I could wrap that up.  I was like, who cares?  I was like, who cares?  I was kind of enjoying the bed.  I had no ending for that anyway.  The clothes that you guys are going to get to see me naked for the next year.  For a year. 
[01:17:30]  For a year.  Because when she turns 18, then she's going to get naked.  Oh, you're a...  Abigail.  She's 17 years old.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's wearing a beautiful little white bikini there.  Where'd you get that one?  I have no idea.  It's a bra and underwear.  It's not even really a bikini.  Oh, well.  There you go.  It says love in the front there.  Not that I was looking.  I will not tease the boys.  I will not tease the boys.  I will not tease the boys.  But I figure this is enough, so I don't need to wear the underwear.  Yeah.  I have to do a little spindle for everybody here in the... 
[01:18:00]  Oh, look at that.  What do you got tattooed on that ass?  I have nothing tattooed on my ass.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I saw some marker or something.  No, there's no tattoo on that ass.  No.  It's just a little smudge mark.  Smudge mark.  Yeah, it must have been a...  You sat on a Sharpie.  Sit on a Sharpie.  Well, that's great.  And the Sharpie has a good tendons.  You must have been moving around when you sat on that Sharpie, because it looks like a name.  Right.  So why did you cover up if you're... 
[01:18:30]  Well, I'll take this off if you want to walk around with this one.  I can read this.  Oh, that's kind of nice.  Yeah.  It's the best I can do, because I can't be naked for you guys, or I would, but I'll get you in a lot of trouble.  Yeah, that's what they say.  That is what they say.  So this is within the law.  Brian, we have no idea.  Brian, we know what the law is.  Yes, this is as far as you can take it with a 17-year-old girl.  You could be an accessory to the fact.  It's not the first time we've had comics arrested. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, I know, I know.  On this show, it happened.  Was it Louis Black or the...  Everybody.  The boy.  Wait, I could just sing.  Yeah.  So the folded arms.  You could be proud.  I don't know.  I'm supposed to be having food put on me somewhere.  Oh, I brought...  Actually, I figured I would make this a banana split.  I brought a banana with me.  Oh, nice.  So when you take the picture, I'm going to swallow it.  I can swallow it whole.  Wait, you...  All right.  You can swallow a banana whole.  I think we've got to bring the attorney back in to okay that one.  I put the whole thing down myself.  Whoa, look at this.  That's your bikini? 
[01:19:30]  That's her.  Yeah, Brian, that's great.  What do you think of Cheryl?  We just talked to her about five minutes ago.  She came back in with her whipped cream bikini.  Yeah, well, apparently they're out of whipped cream.  Yeah.  We're really rationing it because of the war effort.  Yeah.  Rosie the Riveter.  Yeah.  What do you think, Brian?  That's nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, that works.  Yeah, that's a bikini.  I guess there's a lot of contestants out there, so we've got to conserve on what's left in 
[01:20:00]  the whipped cream can.  Yeah, that's why.  Yeah, ladies, come down.  You want to win the trip to Hawaii, you've got all next week as well.  So should I get my banana or what?  Yeah, I would get your banana.  Sure, get your banana.  Brian's got a cute bid on bananas that he's going to go into just...  It's such a rollercoaster, man.  You're going to pick this segment up.  Hey, who are you?  Hey, look at this.  Who?  Wait, talk into the mic.  Anne-Marie.  Look at Anne-Marie.  Anne-Marie.  Lovely as well, Anthony.  And you're there topless right now, and you've got some panties on. 
[01:20:30]  And socks.  And you are...  And socks.  She's wearing white socks.  The bathroom floor is a little sticky.  Oh, yeah.  That's called Jim Norton.  Yeah, that's from yesterday's show.  Yeah, he was making the thing a little sticky.  Yeah, Brian, don't touch anything around here.  No, no, no, I won't.  It's been a wild week.  All right, now you're going to go out and have your bikini done?  Yep.  Very good.  And where are you from?  Originally, I'm from the Bronx, but I just moved to Westchester.  Very cool.  Westchester representing today, Anthony.  Very nice.  Why many callers from Westchester? 
[01:21:00]  Not many.  That's why we point that out.  We don't want to forget about the people from Westchester.  No, not at all.  All right.  I have a representative.  Well, Rick, go out now and help out.  And what the hell are you doing with that banana?  When I get my bikini out, I'm going to come in and top it off by swallowing the banana.  What do you mean?  You can't swallow that.  Yes, I can.  Well, why do you need the whipped cream to do that?  Yeah, you don't have to do that.  Just do it now.  Brian, you better look.  I don't actually swallow.  I just put the banana on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Brian, you better look away.  I don't think you should be saying that. 
[01:21:30]  No, I'm looking out the window.  Just be under it.  If my eyes water, you can't laugh at me because I'm a baby.  If her eyes water.  We're going to corrupt your whole comedy act eventually, Brian.  You know that, right?  All right.  Let's see.  Whoa.  Hey.  Wow.  Holy.  My eyes are watering.  Wow.  That's amazing.  That's quite a trick there.  Can you do it again? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Do it again.  Brian?  I just want to know.  Oh, look.  She almost gags at me.  I can start gagging.  It is a little funny now, so I can't really.  Wow.  All right.  Well, that's a nice little trick.  That is something.  I want to know, is it a trick, you know, like the sword swallowers?  You wonder, like, if the sword is actually going up into the handle.  Is that banana somehow getting back up into the peel, or is it actually? 
[01:22:30]  Oh, that's a good question, Brian.  I think that was legitimately going down her throat.  Yeah.  There was definitely teeth marks to it.  Yeah?  Well, how'd you learn that?  I don't know, actually.  I just kind of figured it out one day.  Yeah?  Did you practice on a banana or something else?  Some lucky guy taught me how to do it.  Taught you like he's doing something good for you.  It was a fruit vendor.  All right.  Look, I'm going to teach you this.  Come over here.  I've got a whole big bunch of bananas. 
[01:23:00]  We're going to keep doing it until we get it right.  Banana number one.  No.  Wrong.  Wrong.  Did not work.  Did not get it completely down.  Banana number two.  Well, good.  You're very good at that.  All right.  So now what are you going to do as far as the whipped cream goes?  You're going to obviously put it over that.  I don't know what Rick decides to put on me.  Well, don't leave it to Rick.  Yeah, Rick.  I want to make sure we do it right, because we don't want to spend the weekend in jail.  All right. 
[01:23:30]  Well, follow Rick, ladies.  Follow Rick.  We've got some fine contestants today.  Yeah.  Bravo.  This is the kind of thing, like, instead of having, like, one attorney, I think you should  have, like, nine Supreme Court justices ruling on every single thing.  Just to rule on whatever's going on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, we've got a five to four decision.  It's okay for the next segment.  Just making laws as we go along that affect the entire country based on what goes on in  here on any given day.  Hey, Brian, did you watch that movie Home Alone? 
[01:24:00]  Yes.  Did you like the Home Alone movie?  Yeah.  Who was in that?  Macaulay Culkin?  Little Macaulay Culkin.  Yeah.  I enjoyed that.  Sure.  And also, his brother was named, was Buzz?  Buzz.  You remember Buzz?  The older brother?  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  Who was obnoxious?  There he is.  That's Buzz from Home Alone.  Hey, Buzz.  How are you, man?  Hey, how do you do it?  Good to see him.  He's a new fan of the show.  Big yellow ones is the song.  Hey.  Hey, you know what?  This is it.  Hey, I've seen it on a movie saying that to me.  That's true.  This is a perfect opportunity to bring up something that, you know, Devin just yelled 
[01:24:30]  out the big yellow one is the song.  Yeah.  We, and I'm being serious.  We're not serious often on this show.  Please don't harass the comics when you see them.  Yeah, yeah.  Be nice.  Because it really takes away from what you're seeing on that stage.  Yeah.  So if you're seeing Brian Regan.  What?  People have been giving him an asshole?  No.  In a good way, man.  It was actually one of the most flattering evenings I've ever had, but it was okay.  Now this, hold on.  I just have to say one thing.  This means I'm kind of moving up in the ranks. 
[01:25:00]  I've been here 30 seconds.  Wham.  Sam Adams down on the table.  Can you tell the bosses I went home early today?  We got girls walking around naked.  Brian Regan throwing out the comedy.  And we got beer.  What else did you want?  Abigail.  Yeah.  But seriously, don't harass the comics.  Be cool.  No.  There's no need to yell out the big yellow ones the sun.  But as soon as Brian Jackal.  It feels great, but it was like there was that one show where it was just like,  I'm the dry yellow ones.  It's for a little league baseball. 
[01:25:30]  It's on that lady.  Spider world.  He's saying you two at the wrong time.  How can I possibly?  It sounds like you're playing to a school for the deaf.  I mean, you want to die.  It was.  They were yelling out every bit that he's ever done.  And Brian being the nice guy, because, you know, he tried to do all the bits at the  same time to make everyone happy in the room.  He's always trying to make people happy.  Trying to make good.  Trying to make people.  I'm just waiting for you to explode one day. 
[01:26:00]  Would you shut the F up?  Like all of a sudden, Brian Regan just loses his effing mind.  Shut up and tell your little C to shut up next to you, you effing Pete.  Starts hurling beer bottles and stuff.  Just goes absolutely nuts.  Throwing tables over.  Brian Regan loses mine.  Can't you see I'm trying to do an administrative assistant greeting card joke?  Come on already.  Yeah, so please don't harass the comics.  Oh, Dave from Jersey. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, my God.  It's Buzz Moore in the studio.  See, I didn't want to go on.  I just came up to pick up some stuff from Rick.  I didn't want to sit on the show because I didn't want people to be like, oh, what the  We just came here to say hi.  That's our listeners.  What is he doing?  Doug, what's up?  I didn't get to the shows, but the big yellow ones.  The big yellow ones.  Have a good weekend, guys.  Thanks, man.  Cool.  How many Home Alones were there?  There were three of them.  Three?  Yeah, but the third one, it was like, it's kind of like European National Influence Vacations. 
[01:27:00]  Like, they just changed the entire family.  They changed everybody.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  Not one person.  But you weren't in three, right?  No.  No one was in three.  Yeah.  No one was in the third one.  Was Macaulay Culkin in three?  No.  Nope.  It was a whole different kid.  There were like four burglars.  I know.  It was terrible.  Four burglars.  Everyone shot at the end.  Horrific Sam Peckinpah-type massacre.  I mean, what?  They really went off.  Look at the map with that home alone.  They had to change the whole cast, though.  You guys are like 30 now, you know? 
[01:27:30]  Oh, my God.  Someone's breaking in the house.  Just get the gun and shoot.  I know.  I think by the third one, it was like Macaulay was married already.  So it's like, you know, they're not going to do a third one.  Devin's saying that like, it's like, I can't believe they did this to us.  Devin, have you looked in the mirror lately?  The third one is the one where Macaulay and Devin start breaking into other people's houses  and harassing children.  They're the ones.  Buzz gets blasted.  And Macaulay burns his apartment.  Oh, wait.  That was real life.  Almost three. 
[01:28:00]  Hey, Earl.  Yo.  Earl, how are you doing?  You're leaving?  Yeah, we are leaving because we have blown through 2,500 stickers.  All right.  Where'd you leave the last box?  I'm sorry.  All right, Earl.  Well, thank you for helping us out in Nyack today.  And we definitely got to come back here because they love you up here.  We know.

Oh, Brian, would you like to see that?  Sure.  But she's going to be...  Oh, it is Mindy?  Wait a minute.  Is this Mindy?  Is this Mindy?  Oh, we met Mindy?  Yes, this is Big Butt Mindy.  All right.  We'll be back after these words.  Just stay on the line.  You're right after Gary Coleman.  Yeah, I was just going to...  I thought it was a girl named Mindy or something. 
[01:29:00]  I think I just got a laugh out of Brian Regan there.  Hey, when you are a sick calf, you enjoy that picture.  Well, no.  I laugh when somebody else does it.  I just can't get involved.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  We've got some hot women getting into whipped cream bikinis.  And we're going to get their pictures up very, very soon.  Oh, you want to do the F.U. line?

Give me a little room for the Planet Java, please.  Keep an eye out for the Planet Java sampling trucks.  The Street Patrol coming to an area near you with the cool new flavors,  Jabadelic, Tremble, and Karamoca.

If you need an extra kick in your day, 121 milligrams of caffeine is going to do it.  Tremble, the highest caffeinated drink in the country.  That's in that one, Brian.  121 milligrams of caffeine.  It's got more caffeine in it than, remember, Jolt?  Yeah.  The soda jolt that came out?  Yeah.  It's got like five times the caffeine of Jolt. 
[01:31:30]  Oh.  Yeah.  Will guaranteed make your heart explode.  Right.  Two of them.  You get the idea.  Tremble does the trick deliciously.  The wildest thing in town, Planet Java.

As does a lot of our contests.  That's why the first couple of days when we get trashed on instant feedback and phone calls,  Dude, what are you doing?  Who's in the contest?  This sucks.  You've got to give it time.  Now look, you guys are going to have a very, very hard decision. 
[01:33:00]  And we're extending the qualifying so ladies, you can come down next week as well.  Yes.  Yes.  We've got a grand prize trip to Hawaii to give away, courtesy of Contiki Tours.  I want to thank the fine folks at WhippedCreamBikini.com.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  That must have been a difficult decision to extend the contest.  Yes.  Yeah, it was.  It sure was.  We really spoiled it.  We've thought it over.  We've decided we're going to allow more beautiful women down here to put whipped cream upon themselves. 
[01:33:30]  You know, it was a tough decision, but someone had to make it, and yeah.  How long did that production meeting last?  Should it go longer?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes, it should.  Much.  I guess the eyes have it.  I'll never forget the look in Brian's eyes.  You know, he's in the middle of his, uh, his, his, his, his kid.  Oh, yeah.  And just a piece of ass was there.  I think it was, uh...  Totally distracted him, and no one cared.  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  It's like all heads just completely turned, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And no one's paying attention.  Yeah, that's a cute joke.  Go!  We got breasts coming into the room.  Don't you wish you could have that for the, you know, when you do your comedy tour around  the country?  You know, you guys know when maybe something's not going as well as you would like.  Sure.  And all of a sudden you can just give the sign, and then the girl comes out to distract everyone.  The girl walks out.  I'm going to start doing that, you know.  Like, as soon as I take a sip of water, that's your cue.  Right.  Come out.  Come out and start doing what you do.  Mesmerize the audience. 
[01:34:30]  Hey, uh, Anthony, I was talking...  I got abused so bad for this last time, but I'm going to just do it anyway.  All right.  Um, Anthony?  Yeah?  I was talking to Brian Regan during the commercials.  Yeah?  And did you know that Brian Regan is a huge Russell Crowe fan?  Is he?  Yeah.  Were you aware of that?  Not at all, Brian.  Well, I am a huge Russell Crowe fan, and I was quite distressed.  Well, tell me about it.  I don't know what you guys are laughing at. 
[01:35:00]  It's totally natural.  It's set up.  It's set up.  Awkward set up.  It's so natural.  Yeah, there's nothing awkward.  I want to hear about Russell Crowe.  Well, you know the kidnapping thing?  Yeah, proof of life.  I mean, you're an actor.  I'm sure you would not want to be in a situation where you might be...  Oh, the real kidnapping thing.  The kidnapping plot.  Oh, yeah.  No, not really.  I don't really know too much.  Well, there was a plot that he was going to get kidnapped and the whole thing, and I just  was wondering, who would have come up with a plot like that?  I can't for the life of me think, like, some guy, you know, sitting at his checkbook 
[01:35:30]  going, honey, I don't know how we're going to hit this minimum on his visa bill.  Hey, hey, wait a second.  That Russell Crowe fellow's pretty popular.  Why don't we nab him?  And even if that's your plan, how are you going to pull that off?  You know what, are you going to, like, come up to him at a public event?  Excuse me, Mr. Crowe, I was wondering if I could maybe get an autograph.  All right, sure.  You got a pen? 
[01:36:00]  In my van.  You don't mind holding this duct tape?  And say you wanted to...  That's your thing.  You're going to get a movie star.  Why would you pick, like, a gladiator who might put up a fight, you know?  Well, I would, like, grab Angela Lansbury or something, you know?  All right.  You take her in a van.  You make her a hundred bucks.  I think she's worth a hundred bucks.  Ten thousand bucks.  Oh, you don't want Angela to think she's cheap. 
[01:36:30]  Look at Brian, editing himself.  And you make your million bucks.  Million bucks.  She's worth that much.  Sure.  Of course.  Hold on.  Hold on, Devin, yes?  Like, you're going to get a backlash from the severe, like, Lansbury uprising.  People support her, like, what are you doing?  She's a wonderful actress.  She's worth more than a hundred dollars.  Brian, it's the offices of Angela Lansbury calling.  We heard your joke.  While it was cute, Angela's very disturbed and upset that you would feel that she's only  worth a hundred dollars. 
[01:37:00]  Did you hear the whole bit?  I was upping it.  I went to it.  I said a thousand and a million.  But, you know, it's like people do.  She could be listening.  I was on a few times ago, and you guys were talking about Sarah Jessica Parker.  And she called in.  She called up.  That was, like, so wild, you know.  It's like, why are you talking about her?  And she's like, hey, hello, this is Sarah.  You know, she was in Ed Wood, the movie Ed Wood, which I rented last night because we've  been playing some of our favorite clips these days are coming from the movie Ed Wood. 
[01:37:30]  Where is that one?  God, today it's more like, pull my swing!  This one is my favorite clip right now from Ed Wood.  Pull the swing!  Pull the swing!  His whole speech that he does is priceless.  Yeah.  Martin Landau playing Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood.  And he's just, you know, I'm despised. 
[01:38:00]  It's just great.  I've got to pull some sounds off of that.  But Sarah Jessica Parker, they're reading a review of the performance at the beginning  of the movie where they were in a play.  And she's reading the review.  She goes, oh, she said I have a face like a horse.  Now, the only reason you'd write something like that is that some people might think that.  Well, let's ask Brian.  Brian, do you think her?  What do you think of Sarah Jessica Parker?  I think she's a very attractive woman and a fine actress.  You would.  What do you think?  What do you think? 
[01:38:30]  Go on to that.  He's the best one.  He is just the best.  All right.  You know what, though?  We'll trip him up.  We'll trip him up.  You would say she was worth more than $100.  Of course.  Yeah.  She's up there in Angela Lansbury land, man.  There's truth serum in your water you're drinking.  Now, we'll get to you.  We've asked him this before, but I forgot how he answered.  What are your feelings on people in history like Adolf Hitler?  It was horrible.  Oh, good one, Ed.  Well, you know, I mean, like, first, no, I would have to say he should not have done what he did. 
[01:39:00]  Wow, that's going out on a limb, Brian.  Woo!  The ever-controversial Brian Regan.  Hey, Brian's ideas don't necessarily reflect those of the Opie and Anthony show.  When you go out on a limb like that and say, Hitler shouldn't have done what he did.  Woo, Brian.  Anthony, you know, you're going to make some enemies.  I'm going to get letters.  I'm sorry.  That's how I feel.  Anthony? 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  Someone has to say it.  Brian Regan, the Lenny Bruce of our time.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  I'm out there in the club saying that kind of thing.  Jesus, Brian.  Rebel.  I thought you were a nice guy.  I know.  No, no, no.  How could you talk?  Shouldn't have done that.  Like a kid that took the glass cookie.  You shouldn't have done that.  I could actually put definitely in front of that.  He definitely did.  Oh, hey.  I could have done what he did.  Wow, Brian. 
[01:40:00]  Way over to one side on that.  That was good.  I love it.  You guys are going to lose another 30% of your listeners now.  You cannot say anything really bad.  Like Superman with the lying or something, right?  Or a Vulcan.  You can't lie.  Is it Vulcan?  Superman or a Vulcan?  Super Vulcan.  George Washington.  One of them.  One of them.  I know Vulcans are incapable of lying.  Super George Washington Vulcan.  Right.  You heard about him. 
[01:40:30]  Hey, let's go to...  He's a great guy.  Let's go to West Coast State.  Hey, Dave.  What's going on?  I am personally shocked at the comments that Brian read.  I know.  I just wanted to know if Brian's head now West anytime in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Yes.  I'm going to be there in about three or four weeks.  Oh, yeah?  Where?  At Cobb's Comedy Club.  Oh, all right.  It's like Fisherman's Wharf.  Hey, Dave.  Yeah, that's right.  Dave, what's your deal?  You listen to us every day from San Francisco, huh?  Yeah, that's right.  We're originally from New Jersey.  We got here about a year and a half ago.  Wow.  Yeah, it was on a syndication underground. 
[01:41:00]  Underground.  Cool.  And I see pictures.  Are those pictures from your house or something on the Golden Gate?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hold on, hold on.  Pictures?  I don't send you pictures.  He has a house under a bridge?  Well, I don't know.  We see him on, like, websites and stuff.  Oh, oh, oh, that.  I know what you're talking about.  That's a webcam.  That's on top of the, I think, Coit Tower.  It's on top of it.  Oh, okay.  I thought it was coming right from your house.  No, no, man.  I was like, damn, that's in the middle.  I know.  You know, the Golden Gate Bridge.  I live in an apartment in Oakland.  Are you kidding me? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, okay, good.  That would be funny if you just put a webcam.  Oh, view from my living room.  It's wonderful.  Why don't you come on over?  Where do you live?  At the top of Coit Tower.  You can't miss it.  All right, guys.  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Yeah, that's in case of Leningrad is getting a little crazy.  Yeah, a lot of people hooked in.  So you guys, people can listen to you anywhere, basically, by getting on the computer?  Yeah, see what it is with our company, the company that owns this station and a bunch  of other stations, they don't like streaming media on the Internet. 
[01:42:00]  They don't like the shows being on the Internet on company websites and whatnot.  But people are very clever.  They take their radio at home, they plug in, they plug into their computers, they make  a website, and anyone can log on around the country.  Yeah.  So it's kind of underground, we call it.  Syndication.  Oh, that's fantastic.  Underground.  It's not sanctioned by anybody in this company.  But you'd have to know how to do that.  I mean, you've got to be pretty savvy to be able to hook your computer up to a radio station  and another...  I believe you're good at that, though, Brian. 
[01:42:30]  What you do is...  I think all you do is audio out, audio in.  It's really not that big...  See, right there, you lost me.  Already you're using that jargon.  Jargon.  Audio.  Brian's a computer geek, yeah?  No, no, no.  Actually, you know what?  I've got to get a new computer because...  Oh.  Well, a friend of mine...  A friend of mine's got a computer that, like, is smart, you know?  Like, it guesses what you're going to do. 
[01:43:00]  Like, you're writing on a thing and, you know, you just write...  You let me work on it, you write M-O-N and this thing pops up.  Monday?  And you're like, yeah, yeah, Monday.  And you hit that and you write F-E-B.  February?  Yes.  And then this thing pops up.  It looks like you're trying to write a letter.  Do you need help?  Yeah.  Write the damn thing, you know?  And, you know, at mine, I go home at mine and it's just, you know, it tries, but, you  know, I write M-O-N, you know, monkey?  No, Monday, man.  F-E-B. 
[01:43:30]  Febreze fabric softener?  Ah, February.  It looks like you're trying to write the Magna Carta.  Do you need help?  Your computer's a little slow.  Yeah.  But I didn't realize.  Audio in, audio out.  Yes.  There's the key.  Hey, what does Brian think of slow people?  What?  Well, his computer's a little slow.  I was wondering, what do you think of people that are a little slow?  What, maybe the... 
[01:44:00]  You don't want to...  What's he going to say?  I don't worry what path you guys are taking.  They should be put to death?  Yeah, usually I'm pretty, like, you know, I think that everybody has a place, but slow  people, I think, should be slaughtered.  Wait a minute, are you all right?  Yeah, they should definitely be slaughtered.  And not even, like, in a pleasant way, like a needle in the arm.  I'm talking pain, suffering, and agony. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, my God!  This is from the guy that said, Hitler might have did a no-no.  No, definitely.  Oh, yeah.  Definitely.  Right, definitely.  He should not have done what he did.  Wow.  Okay.  Wait, I want to make...  You're talking about slow people, right?  Right.  Okay, okay, then I stand by one.  Hey, Farrah.  What's up, Farrah?  I was just going to say how nice Brian Regan was, but now we have to get a comment about  slow people.  Oh, see, you lost the fed, Brian.  Are you... 
[01:45:00]  Are you so...  I thought he was so sweet, and you guys were corrupting him, and now, look what he just  said.  That's terrible.  Listen, if you're slow, just stand up against the wall and get ready to be slaughtered,  okay?  No, I'm just playing.  I'm playing.  I'm just...  That's not nice.  Okay, you're right.  You're right.  I thought you were very sweet, and now I changed my mind.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  Watch, you can't stand by what he said.  Watch.  Of course.  Can we just edit that whole last thing?  I think it should be dropped or whatever.  I agree. 
[01:45:30]  Hit the cough button.  He's going to cough a lot.  But I think you're very nice Brian.  Thank you.  Everyone has their place in society.  Is he...  I'm going to be tossing and turning all night tonight about that two-minute slow joke.  Right.  All right.  Thank you, Farrah.  Though someone may be slow, I'm sure he has some talents that can be used in our society.  Paulie.  Hey, Paulie.  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey. 
[01:46:00]  I'm Jewish, and I think even Brian's comments were a little harsh on the whole Hitler thing.  He's being a little harsh on Hitler.  Coming from a Jew.  But he's right on with the retards.  Well, you know...  I did not say retards.  I'm talking about slow people.  Yes.  They move slowly.  My bad.  Yeah, we're just...  Yeah, we don't know what some slow people mean.  Wait a minute, faggot.  That's funny, man.  I'm not a bad guy.  Oh, that's horrible.  Very good.  Well, Dennis wants to talk to Brian Regan.  Dennis, what's going on? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah, I want to talk to Brian Farrakhan over there.  What's his issue, man?  Hey, when you get angry, and you have a position, you take it.  And you stand firm.  Yeah, right there.  I'm not saying that I'm afraid of you, my brother.  I'm not saying that I'm sorry.  Take it easy, fellas.  Can you imagine Brian talking with, like, the lost tribe of Israel, like, there in Times  Square?  Oh, yeah.  Those guys are like, they're the white devils. 
[01:47:00]  Brian's up there like, he probably was on the wrong track.  Okay, sorry.  White devil.  It's one way to look at it.  The devil has his positive points.  Satan was the right hand of God for a while, so I'm sure there was some nice...  Before he was, you know, Satan was an angel.  No, now he's bad. 
[01:47:30]  But back then, you know, back in the day, you've got to give it to him.  Sure.  Hey, Anthony, what's up?  Yo, I am joining here.  You can do this snow cone little league bit.  I played, you know, I played little league baseball.  Did you know that?  Well, I'm trying to think of how to cut to the quick.  I played out in right field, you know, because, you know, that just wasn't very good.  And all I knew is at the end of the game, I would get a free snow cone.  That's all I knew.  I'd just be out there going, it's hot.  It's hot.  I need a free snow cone. 
[01:48:00]  I need...  I got to get it.  I'm going to get a free snow cone.  And then, you know, the second baseman would go, Brian, two away, two away.  Okay.  Coach, he said, how many outs, Brian?  I'm going to get a free snow cone.  At the end of the game, I'm going to get a free snow cone.  They give everybody, if you play, a free one.  You don't have to give them any coins.  You just get in line and you say, hey, I've played at least a half a game. 
[01:48:30]  And then they give you the snow cone.  But they won't give you a half a snow cone.  They won't say, hey, did you play half a game?  Then here's a half a snow cone.  What they do is they say, what you do, if you play a whole game, you get a whole snow cone.  If you play half a game, you get a whole snow cone.  So the way I remember it is, always whole snow cone.  That's how I remember that. 
[01:49:00]  That's how I'm going to keep going.  Oh, Jesus.  That damn Hitler, though.  Brian, what's your favorite flavor, though?  You like cherry?  Well, my coach would say, Brian, what's the score?  Grape!  I'm going to get a grape or cherry.  They're both my favorites.  But grape is a little bit more of a favorite.  But if they don't have grape, I say, that's fine.  Give me cherry because that's my favorite, too. 
[01:49:30]  It's just not my most favorite.  It's just not my most of the favorites.  But it is a favorite.  All right, Brian.  Two away, Brian.  Then I'll get lime.  Or rainbow.  No, I won't get rainbow because if they don't have grape or cherry, then you really can't do a rainbow.  People would say, that's not rainbow.  That's lime. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, oh, Jesus.  Coach ever say you should go up against the one and be slaughtered painfully?  Hey, Matt, what's up?  I want to tell Reagan to take his hate-mongering back where he was.  This is getting out of control, man.  Hate-mongering.  You know, people are going to tune in late and go, what the hell did he say?  He must have said something really out there. 
[01:50:30]  All right, thank you, Matt.  I'm sorry, man.  That's how I feel.  It took over a year, but we finally corrupted Ryan.  Yeah.  We do that for you.  Hold on.  Breaking point.  All right, let me go to Scott.  Scott, you're next on WNAW.  How are you doing?  And I want to know what you thought about Timothy McVeigh and what he did out there in Oklahoma.  Oh, now you're getting just sick.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Oh, there's no upside to that.  How can you bring up a saint like McVeigh?  Oh, no, no, no, no. 
[01:51:00]  They made a nice part.  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  One of those choose words carefully.  Yes.  I think it's great.  They're frying him on closed circuit.  Well, frying.  That would be great.  A little legal injection.  They put him to sleep.  They're just giving him some NyQuil.  You know, in some places, they do the executions at 7 o'clock in the morning.  I don't know if they're doing that with him.  Yeah.  But I just think, is that like the cruelest?  Like, 7 in the morning.  Is the guy supposed to get some sleep the night before, you know? 
[01:51:30]  Oh, man, I've got to get a little shut-eye.  Yeah, I've got a short day tomorrow.  7 o'clock in the morning.  Kill me at midnight, will you?  And then, you know, I'll just plan the whole day around that.  I can't look.  Okay, today, this will be like the last day.  And then I get to sleep.  And then I get up and I have some eggs.  And then what happens at 7?  Oh, yes, that's right. 
[01:52:00]  That is horrible.  Because, yeah, 7 o'clock in the morning.  You're not sleeping at night.  No, you're not going to sleep.  So where's the prisoner?  He's sleeping.  You know, we've been trying to wake him up.  Hey, you've got to get up.  You know what today is?  Wake up already.  He must not remember what today is.  It's 6.30.  You're going to be late. 
[01:52:30]  Unbelievable.  You're going to be late.  7 o'clock in the morning.  What the hell happened to you, Brian?  I never thought of that.  That makes perfect sense.  Midnight.  Kill you at midnight.  That's what that whole day is all about.  Then you're tired.  You probably wouldn't mind it.  You're cranky, though.  You're just like, all right, you know something?  Kill me.  But I'm tired.  You're ready to hit the rack anyway.  I've been thinking of this all damn day.  My nerves are racked. 
[01:53:00]  Instead, it's like, all right, go to sleep.  Wake up and we'll take care of you.  Yeah.  You're probably terse with the warden that morning, you know?  Yeah.  You're a little cranky.  Jason, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I was wondering if you two were going to ask Brian about doing a bit on Jotty.  Oh, yeah.  We do Brian.  We're going to jot it down.  Yeah, we do Brian Regan bits when you're not here now, Brian.  We make up our own.  I'm going to just take this time to apologize to you.  Oh, man.  Someone called up and said, or Opie said, you should jot something down. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, I was giving out a number or something.  And then we just started thinking about how ridiculous the word jot is.  And I kept going, jot.  So we just started completely stealing your personality and really riffing on it.  Talking about jotting and driving.  I'm jotting and driving at the same time.  I've got to jot that down.  I better jot that down.  And there was no punchline.  It was just you saying jot.  I don't really want to write it because that would be, like, a little too formal.  And I don't want to chicken scratch it because that's not really giving it what it's worth. 
[01:54:00]  But I think I'll jot it.  I'm going to jot it down.  Man, you guys.  Oh, you're doing great, Brian Regan.  He does a great, Opie and Anthony, doing Brian Regan.  I'm thinking all this stuff and using it in the show.  Hell, yeah.  Good night.  Thanks for coming out, folks.  Jotting and driving at the same time.  I like show up and he'll be out in a marquee, you know.  Jot jokes.  Tonight. 
[01:54:30]  As seen on TV, the jot guy.  I like when a comic has, like, one bit and they go, he's the pancake guy.  Because he has the pancake bit.  Gallagher.  Gallagher, the watermelon guy.  The watermelon guy.  And what's his name?  The guy from Long Island.  With the football.  Oh, oh, oh.  Bob Nelson.  Bob Nelson.  He's funny, though.  Yeah, he's good.  But he's got a few different characters.  Yeah, but they would always promo him with the one bit, the football.  Right, right.  I play football guy. 
[01:55:00]  That was the bit that made him huge, though.  Yeah.  That was everywhere.  Ivan, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I'm sitting here in the car fuming.  I want to know if WNEW endorses this point of view of this rabble rouser on the air.  Rabble rouser.  I want to be a rabble rouser.  These words are great.  I don't want to be a militant.  In my name, you're the king.  But I want to be a little better than a delinquent.  I'll be a rabble rouser.  Oscar wants to say hi to Brian. 
[01:55:30]  Oscar, sorry.  Yeah, how you doing?  Hey, Oscar.  I'm the local regional director of the Aryan Nations.  I just wanted to know if he'd like to come down and work our functions.  Man.  It's always good to, you know, so then Brian's always good to know that there are more of  us out there.  That's good, man.  Get easy.  Sweating the word.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  We better take a break.  Brian Regan hanging with us.  He's playing Rascals in Ocean Township tonight.  You guys are crazy if you don't go.  Rascals in West Orange tomorrow night. 
[01:56:00]  And Governors in Levittown on Long Island.  Two shows Sunday.  I'm going to one of those shows.  I'll probably go to both.  Wherever you are.  I think you can do that.  I think Brian changes his second show around.  Yeah, isn't that funny?  I was like, so, man, thanks for coming, guys.  And you're like, God, we're probably going to hang around again.  I'm in the back jotting new jokes down.  This is how nice he is, though.  Seriously.  We'll stay for both shows.  I'll bring, you know, a couple of my brothers, Sandy, whoever's around, you know.  And we see him after the first show.  Like, you know, we're thinking of staying for the second show. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, no.  And the guy is so nice.  He changes the whole second show just so we get to see new stuff.  I see him looking around the dressing room.  Basket of fruit.  You can write something funny about that.  Walk on stage with the basket.  What is with this basket of fruit?  Like, you got apples and bananas.  You can't get, what, they're different, yet they're saying they're both fruit but different. 
[01:57:00]  He's ripping on a bowl of fruit.  Then you guys will be going, hey, Brian, I think we're going to head home now.  Yeah, ooh, look at this.  It's time.  Ooh, we've got to get going.  I'd love to hear more fruit jokes.  I'm going to say it on the air.  Even though I'm going to be hiding in the back row, I'm only going to one show at Governor's.  Yeah.  Oh, man, I love when you come out.  It's great.  Right on.  Do you want to go to the FU line?  Yeah.  Do you have any more of those?  Sure we do.  More with Brian Regan in just a bit.  Thanks for calling, and this is the Opie and Anthony FU Friday Live.

Hey, so look off your face.  I'm going to have to assume it's because your panties have bunched up your butt.  Well, he's pink, Tony, wearing saggots.  I can't stand it.  Isn't anyone not that cool at the $16,000 Chrysler, you friggin' loser?

Our own funk soul brother.  Hang with Brian Riggins.  Brian, you into the Fat Boy.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  You do the Fat Boy.  Yeah, man.  That sounds good.  Fat Boy's all right, right?  Sure. 
[02:01:00]  Fat Boy Slim.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  You have no idea.  What do you listen to, Brian?  Yeah, Brian.  Usually.  Fat Boy and Fat Boy Slim.  Both of them.  Yeah, I mean, we don't really know much about what you like.  What kind of music you listen to when you're listening to music, Brian?  I like...  Tell us something about yourself.  I like the great Caruso.  You like the great Caruso?  Sure.  You got all his stuff.  Very powerful voice.  Drive around, put on some Caruso and just jam. 
[02:01:30]  Nothing better than hearing a loud, whoa, coming out of a car.  Oh, hold on, dude.  No, no.  Devin's still here.  No, I'm going to leave.  No, no, no.  Is that here?  Come on, I'm going to leave.  Oh, Devin's still here.  Oh, let me get the hand with his mic off.  I'm in my seat.  What the hell?  I don't...  I don't...  You don't ever want to hear that.  Oh, Devin's still here.  Devin's still here.  Still here.  Right.  Now, let me turn your mic back on.  Hey, Brian, get the hand, because... 
[02:02:00]  That's the next commercial break.  We're going to say that if I use it.  No, I'm just kidding.  Oh, Brian's still here.  We're back, and...  Oh, my gosh, you're still sitting over there.  Right.  And we don't know how to tell you to leave, so...  Okay.  So we'll just have some uncomfortable silence.  Right.  Yeah, I did a radio show down in Charlotte, North Carolina, and, you know, they finished  a break, and, you know, they didn't say, okay, that's it.  I'm just sitting there, and a producer came up to me, like, while the song was playing  and said, well, I don't know how else to put it, but don't let the door hit you in the 
[02:02:30]  ass.  Oh.  Well, try to put it differently.  There are other ways to put it.  Right.  Well, they had to get back to the music.  There's, you know, you could go with, hey, thanks for coming in.  Right.  Look forward to having you next time.  I couldn't believe it.  I mean, it's sort of like, sort of being funny, but, you know...  But not.  But not yet.  I didn't think it was hysterical.  Hey, Opie was...  That was funny, because, you know, he really does want me to leave.  No. 
[02:03:00]  Don't get me wrong.  No.  We are very sarcastic on the show, and if you don't know that, then you shouldn't hang  with it.  I totally...  If you don't know that, then maybe you should leave.  If you should...  Imagine if the door hit you.  Hit you and Brian's ass on the way out.  I'll take Brian with you.  Don't let Brian's front hit your ass as the door hits Brian in the ass.  You know, Devin, maybe I just sorely misjudged you, okay?  All right, Brian, we'll let you in on a little O&A secret, because you come to the show a lot. 
[02:03:30]  There have been times we've had guests in the studio, and we don't know how to say goodbye to them.  Yeah.  One of the things we do is just, um, we stop talking.  You two stop?  Yeah.  We just completely stop talking.  Yeah.  You want to see someone squirm in their seat and start sweating, and they don't know what  to do.  And they just start staring at you, and they look at the light going, yeah, it says on  air, okay?  It's on air.  And we'll do something so it's not really... 
[02:04:00]  Like, I might fuss with a sound effect machine, and then we'll just do it like this.  All right, all right.  And, uh, so the guy's going to, like, take it upon himself to, well, um, thanks for having  me on.  And they're like, dude, I'd say goodbye for you.  Yeah, and we don't even say goodbye.  It gets to the point where they'll just, finally, after, like, three minutes of uncomfortableness,  they will take their own headphones off and walk out. 
[02:04:30]  The sickest phenomenon.  It is the sickest game and the most uncomfortable.  I actually turned on the radio once while you guys were in the middle of doing it, and I  didn't know what was going on.  I had no idea.  Dead air.  Just dead air and just someone, like, uh, uh, that's really all I heard.  Because we don't want people tuning in and going, oh, the station's off the air today.  So, we'll just do a little noises, like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  And the guy, of course, whoever's in the studio at first starts, like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. 
[02:05:00]  So, we told you that because you're a friend, and we will never do that to you by all.  Oh, man, no.  I'll be looking for it now.  That's right.  So we were talking about the music he likes.  Yeah, it was just, you know, opera's a little weird in the car.  I couldn't imagine some guy singing opera in the car and not having someone dialing 911 that's going to have a heart attack.  Can you see the guy's mouth open real wide, sweat, turning all red.  Open note.  Oh, my God, the guy's dying. 
[02:05:30]  He can't sing opera.  His face is all purple.  You ever sit in the car and the song's on and you like it, but you're stopped at a light.  You don't want to see people singing, so you do the ventriloquism thing.  You got to do the ventriloquism now.  That's so true.  Three grass and high tights forever.  Eight, six, seven, five, three, oh, nine, all right. 
[02:06:00]  Jenny, Jenny, who can I learn to?  Look, I'm drinking water and singing at the same time.  Charlie McCarthy, driving around the city.  Yeah.  Don't turn around, uh-oh.  The cars I've been told, uh-oh.  Charge, jump.  A couple of wheels couldn't help you up as well.  Look, my lips aren't doing either.  Isn't that funny?  Step out of the what?  I can't see your license. 
[02:06:30]  Have I been what?  Hey, Bob, what's up?  Bob.  Hey.  Hey, Bob.  Bob, turn down your radio.  You're on.  All right.  You look like you have something to say.  Let's go.  Hey, man, we just got a wild sighting.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, we have all these girls, four girls in a Chrysler C-Brain convertible, pumping up  in Anthony, flashing everywhere on the road.  We're on Sunrise Highway.  There you have it.  Beautiful.  Long Island.  Thank you, Long Island.  Clashing.  Thanks, Bob.  No problem.  Yeah, our little Whip-Em-Out Wednesday thing, Brian, is starting up again. 
[02:07:00]  Does that mean that it's doing well so far, huh?  Does that mean that this is Wolf?  Like Whip-Em-Out Friday?  No, it's Whip-Em-Out whenever we pretty much say now.  Pretty much if you have the WOW sticker and the ladies feel like doing it, they'll do  it.  But we focus on the Wednesday thing.  All right.  Well, Whip-Em-Out.  Oh, W-O-W-O.  Yes.  Yeah, I'm sitting here trying to figure it all out.  Your computer didn't sell it after you, did it?  Whip-Em-Out.  I'm thinking W-E-O-M.  Whip-Em.  What kind of bumper sticker is that?  We-O-M.  We-O-M.  Come on, We-O-M, everybody.  Your computer didn't help you spelling that one.  That is catchy. 
[02:07:30]  I had an acronym business for a while, but it didn't go very well.  I would always put the extra letters in there and just screw it all up.  You know, I like your idea for WOW, but I was thinking, how about WE-O-W?  Yeah, what happened to the UM?  Yeah, the E for the M.  I never liked when people did that with acronyms and kind of left out, oh, it's convenient. 
[02:08:00]  We leave the O for OF out.  There's a whole word missing in there.  Who do you think you're messing with with your acronym?  When they actually, you can tell that they use, they make up an acronym word and they  have some twisted, you know, organization, you know.  We're for help, help everyone dot com.  I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.  Well, they've got to throw a word in.  They wouldn't have used the word, but it helps the acronym out. 
[02:08:30]  Instead of just the acronym being part of the name, they have to throw a word in there.  Right.  Yeah.  I don't have an example of that right now.  I don't have one either.  And I wish I did.  I'd seem really quick and witty.  I'm over here.  I'm the only idiot to do a setup to a joke with absolutely no punchline in my mind.  So I just kept making the setup longer and longer, hoping I'd think of something.  Acronyms are hard.  You know, I put a word and they come up with a twisted thing like, you know, it would be 
[02:09:00]  something as if I, I mean, imagine, imagine if they were to put it in and then you'd be  listening, right?  And it would be something like, do you have to do a commercial?  I can't think of a word.  People will have to depend on the listeners.  You know what?  I just put it all up.  Now, call them with your favorite punchline. 
[02:09:30]  Call them with your punchline to the acronym bit.  Lame.  Make your own punchline.  All right, for the next half, we're going to let our listeners write.  You just do the setup on stage and let them do their own punchlines.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  Very good.  Mike, you're next on NEW.  Yeah, Hopi.  Yeah.  Question for you.  Since you're going to Governor's again this weekend, you're going to get pulled over  for doing donuts in the parking lot again? 
[02:10:00]  Well, you know what happened?  Well, yeah, last time.  I was driving a brand new Lexus that the fine Lexus dealership gave us.  We could drive around for like three weeks.  And we went and saw John Valby.  Yeah.  Who's like you in Bizarro World.  He's on the other side of the comedy spectrum.  Yeah.  Very funny guy.  And, yeah, I was doing donuts in the parking lot after the show.  They have a huge parking lot.  It was snowy and stuff.  And I wanted to see what the Lexus could do.  I got pulled over by a cop. 
[02:10:30]  And the whole club.  After the show.  And the whole club.  It was just drunk written all over.  Yeah.  Everyone from Governor's comes running out, management and stuff, panicking like, oh,  my God, he's getting arrested.  And especially since you were seeing John Valby.  Right.  It's not like, oh, no, I'm not drinking, officer.  Yeah, what are you supposed to say to a cop?  What?  Can I help you, officer?  What was I doing?  Yeah, like when you're speeding a little bit or maybe you didn't use the blinker and  you got to ask him, what was I doing?  Because he honestly didn't realize it. 
[02:11:00]  You're doing flying donuts in the parking lot.  Not just cute little ones.  Not cute little ones.  Because this is a big parking lot.  I was going round and round and round.  And, yeah, he comes up.  I'm like, where did he come from?  It's a parking lot.  Where was he lying?  You didn't see him.  I didn't see the no donut sign.  So I did what anyone should do when they get pulled over by a cop for doing donuts in  a parking lot at 1 a.m.  I started giggling and laughing.  Yeah.  You know, no joke.  In a bar parking lot.  And my girlfriend is in the passenger seat just, it's so funny. 
[02:11:30]  You're going to get arrested.  That'll get you out of a ticket.  The giggle technique.  It turns out that the guy, I know, I know.  When in doubt, giggle at the cop.  I do something wrong.  All right.  Get out of here.  He giggles.  He's giggling and doing donuts.  I have to a comedy show.  I just had a few extra giggles left.  I know there's a goddamn drink minimum in there. 
[02:12:00]  So I know you were drinking something.  But it turned out the guy, just to finish up this boring story,  he was a fan of the show, and he purposely went there to just bust my balls.  Man.  That's a fan, huh, Brian?  Sure.  That'll help you get out of some tickets.  Opie Mike from Queens says the NAACP is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  There you go.  So he helped us out. 
[02:12:30]  There you go.  Thank you.  And Marty from Jersey has a whip, W-H-I-P.  What the hell is the punchline?  Did very well.  Hey, Rob, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I got one.  It's Pontiac.  Pontiac.  Oh, this old gag.  That old gag.  Racist.  Thank you.  Even Brian didn't find that funny.  And we all know what a rabble rouser he is.  Hate-monger and rabble rouser. 
[02:13:00]  We learned that about him today.  Lesbian and bisexual women in action is labia?  They're really a...  See, that might be an actual...  Yeah, I think it is labia.  Yeah, because they made that up.  You wouldn't just call your organization Lesbians and Bisexual Women in Action and go, you know, we can make labia out of that.  Oh, my gosh.  You know what that spells?  Right.  I mean, they picked words so it spelt labia.  That's the point we were trying to get across, really, when you think about it. 
[02:13:30]  That's the whole point.  I'm going to jot that down.  That I ain't completely had.  What a mess.  That's all right.  I think I'm going to get on the radio and just, you know, brainstorm with some half-assed premises.  And just drive in to some dead ends.  I'm so good.  I know I'll make it work.  What happens?  Oh, cocky.  I know it'll work. 
[02:14:00]  Uh-oh.  I've hit a wall.  You guys are just staring, you know, and I'm thinking, oh, God, somebody throwing a white towel here.  I've got to come up with something.  Oh, even that is funny.  Oh, man.  Well, we've had some fun here today.  Yes.  Brian actually has to let the door hit his ass on the way out now.  No, he really has to get the jersey.  He's got, yeah.  Going down to Oosin Township tonight.  You got two shows tonight?  Two tonight, two in West Orange tomorrow, two at Governor's in Levittown. 
[02:14:30]  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Sunday.  Right.  And not only ain't going to play the silent game with Brian Reagan, because now we know he's coming.  I feel like I should just run out of here before I even have the chance.  Wait, there's a connection here with the silent game.  What was the...  He warmed up for Brian that one time at Caroline.  Jim Gaffigan.  He was a hilarious guy.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let me state right now, he wasn't warming up for me.  He's fantastic. 
[02:15:00]  He just happened to be on the show.  Oh, my God.  Seriously, Jim Gaffigan is great.  He's hilarious.  We had him on the phone.  We decided, out of love, to play the silent game with him, and it was really good.  Yeah.  It was really good.  Hello?  Right.  That's even better, because then you have to wait for them to hang out, because you've got to give up eventually,  and then just awkwardly taking the phone, and, okay.  Okay.  We always decide to start it after a long conversation, like where they're talking for a while,  so they're not sure what happened in the interim. 
[02:15:30]  So it's like, yeah, well, I got a broken bullhorn.  I got a broken bullhorn.  My telephone thing doesn't work.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm back.  Now it's not even going to be funny.  Now, what did you say before that?  Yeah, well, I got this new show on CBS.  I'm very proud of it.  It's going to be very funny.  I guess Monday nights at 8 o'clock.  Look for it.  And we think we're really proud of it.  And then you hear the off phone thing, like, 
[02:16:00]  Hello?  I think they hung up.  Which is even better, but they're not sure.  Hello?  Am I on?  No, wait.  We lost the connection.  I hate when you do a phone, or you call in,  and they don't tell you whether you're on the air or not, you know?  Oh, yeah.  Sometimes you're right on the air, right off the bat. 
[02:16:30]  Sometimes there's like a little holding period.  You know, and sometimes the DJs, they sound like they're on the air.  They go, Hey, Brian, how you doing here?  You're like, I'm doing good.  You know, I'm playing that at the Chuckle Hut on Tuesday and Wednesday.  Okay, we're going to be going on in about 10 seconds here.  All right.  Hey, I'm on the phone with Brian Regan right now.  And we're not on the air yet.  I just speak like this.  Ho-ho!  Brian!  Ten minutes.  Ten minutes, we'll get you right on.  Ho-ho!  You know, we love you. 
[02:17:00]  Can you talk?  Even though we're not on the air yet.  Here on the Madcap Hijinx Hour.  Very good.  We've really got to get you out of here,  because we're getting reports.  Traffic is horrible, man.  You've got to get there by eight.  Well, everyone, thank you.  That's Brian.  And I look forward to seeing how the competition continues  with the whipped cream contestant.  Yes.  I think you scared them away, Brian. 
[02:17:30]  No.  Keep checking in.  They were coming in like crazy before you showed up.  Thanks for that.  It's his political views.  It's outlandish political views of keeping them away.  Well, Hitler was bad.  I am out of here.  Brian, do you really have to go?  Because, um...  I kind of, you know, don't want to...  Oh, God.  Don't just sit here with Devin.  No, no, no, guys.  Now, finally, I'll get to talk with you guys, you know?  I got this great band. 
[02:18:00]  I want to...  What's the matter, guys?  We've got to get out an hour early today.  I was actually just hanging around  because I wanted to say goodbye to Brian  because he was hysterical.  Devin?  Yes.  Man, what a human being.  You did a great job.  I look forward to your movie project  that you're telling me about.  Hey, Devin, you want to talk to Brian  about the movie project?  As...  As Brian walks down the hall  and drives to Jersey? 
[02:18:30]  No, that's okay.  I could just talk about it here, right?  I mean, that's cool to you guys, right?  You have room in your car?  Sure.  What do you want to hear about?  I thought Macaulay was the kid  that got left behind.  This is Home Alone 4.  This is Home Alone 4.  The houseguest that wouldn't leave.  It's going to be 7 o'clock.  You guys are going to leave.  I'm just going to be here.  I get the horn.  Herky, herky.  I love that joke. 
[02:19:00]  Herky.  Swinging paint canvas.  Swinging strings into the cleaning lady's head.  I'm going to take a hot iron to your head soon.  We've really got to say goodbye to Brian.  And Brian, seriously, all kidding aside.  Brian, really?  A bunch of us are going to be seeing it all over the place.  Rascals in Ocean Township tonight.  Rascals in West Orange Saturday night.  And Governors in Levittown on Long Island.  Two shows Sunday night.  I'm going to the Governor's show,  so we'll see you out there.  All right, man.  And I'm serious. 
[02:19:30]  Don't harass the comics, please.  No.  Please.  We beg you.  People mean well.  They do.  You can call them a-holes.  Let Brian do his thing tonight,  and you'll really enjoy the show.  Thank you, Brian.  Interrupt me.  It's Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Ladies, come down to WNEW anytime between 3 and 7  for your chance to win the grand prize trip to Hawaii.  It's your body covered in our cream. 
[02:20:00]  Opie and Anthony's Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  1027 WNEW.  Catch the best of Opie and Anthony.  Saturdays, 11 to 3.  1027 WNEW.  WNEW.  Nice going retro, aren't you?  Yeah.  Much like the opener of the show today.  A little retro.  You've got to get the retro rock in sometimes, Opie. 
[02:20:30]  You know how popular the retro rock is.  I knew it.  Ladies.  I knew it. 
[02:21:00]  Wait, something went out.  I can't hear anything.  Hold on.  Okay, we're back.  What the heck are you guys doing?  It was just a frisbee war in here.  Yeah, man.  I want to thank another one of our sponsors, Planet Java, for the frisbees that just took out half the equipment.  Yeah.  In the studio.  Nice head, Pete.  Right on, Brewer, right on.  Oh, Rick.  Oh, wait, that light went out.  What'd you say? You hit something.  All right, chill out. 
[02:21:30]  These things are being banked off the walls like crazy and smacking everybody in the back of the head.  Yeah, Planet Java, great idea.  Send the Opie and Anthony show about 100 frisbees to throw around.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'm telling you, we're crack addicts. Cut it out. Stop tempting us with throw.  Nice.  Oh, what a day, what a day, Anthony.  Oh, and I think Brewer's still coming in. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, yeah?  He might. He might stop by to say hi.  Now that Brian's gone, I can tell everyone I'm going to see Brewer tonight at Caroline's.  Wait a minute.  You said you were going to see Brian.  That's Sunday.  Oh, Sunday.  Right.  You going to Brewer again tonight?  It kind of sucks when everyone that you know and love from this show plays at the same time.  Yeah.  And lately, it's really been like that.  It's getting a little crazy.  Everyone's been in town.  But, yeah, we're doing up Jim Brewer and Jeff Norris and Rich Voss tonight at Caroline's. 
[02:22:30]  That's going to be fun as well.  You saw it last night, right?  Yeah.  Very, very good show all around.  Anthony, we're going to have to pick a winner in about 15 minutes, I guess.  We're doing that Survivor getaway contest.  What you do is you watch CBS 2 News between 6A and 7A.  And we choose one winner every day at 630 to qualify to go to L.A. for a live broadcast of Survivor.  Their town hall meeting that they're going to do next week.  Yes.  I should warn people, when you qualify, one of you guys are going to win the trip to L.A. 
[02:23:00]  And you're going to have to leave, like, the next day.  Yeah, immediately.  So be prepared.  Basically, between 6A and 7A on CBS 2 News, Anthony and I do a video clip that, yeah, we'll be honest with you.  It borders on a little wacky.  It's a little zany.  A little zany.  And then we, you know, we ask you a question about the video clip you saw on TV in the morning.  And we're going to win her that way.  Okay.  You were pretty wacky this morning, Opie. 
[02:23:30]  Pretty psychotic, right?  Yes.  Like a lunatic.  That's my I-need-more-money face that I've been giving Ken Stevens.  That's why Ken isn't even in the same state today.  No.  And the grand prize is, yeah, going to win two free tickets to fly to L.A. from Delta Business, EIT, three days and two nights in L.A.  That's a fine prize.  Wow, we're starting to get cool stuff to give away.  What the hell is going on around here?  I don't know.  Trip to L.A.  We got the trip to Hawaii for the whipped cream bikini contest. 
[02:24:00]  That is going very well.  Ladies, you have all next week to come down to qualify.  Yeah.  We have any more that came in today?  No, that was about it.  That was about it.  Well, there's still time, ladies, if you're around the building.  Come in.  Trip to Hawaii.  Virgil.  Yo.  What's up, Virgil?  Oh, God.  You guys are killing me with this 80s music today.  What's next?  The unskinny bop?  Unskinny bop bop.  I can't take it anymore.  People think that I'm listening to, like, the oldie stations here. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, yeah, because we play a total of, uh, what's the total music we play?  What's the next thing you guys are going to do?  Those little things, late night TV.  The 80s were awesome.  And now you can get them all in one big package.  You know what?  Those 80s stations are popping up everywhere.  Yep.  That's the new thing in radio.  The worst decade of music ever.  80s music and beyond.  Take it easy, faggot.  And the stations that aren't 80s have, uh, usually have the all-80s request or something  like that.  And you get to hear those, uh, fine 80s songs. 
[02:25:00]  A couple of them are kind of cool to hear again.  But for the most part, oof, I, you know how we, uh, like to talk about, like, those wacky  radio cliches that other stations do?  Yeah.  Uh, there's a new one.  You know how we talk about, like, the 5 o'clock funny, the 5 o'clock traffic jam, where, where  your favorite rock station will give you three rockin' tunes for your ride home?  For your ride home.  They call it the 5 o'clock traffic jam.  There's a station.  And I would give them a plug if I, but I can't remember which one I was listening to.  And, uh, their little bit, right around, uh, quitting time in the afternoon, they do 
[02:25:30]  a work release program.  The work release program.  You're released from work when it's a program.  And then they list all the, like, bands they're going to play during their work release program  that afternoon.  Do PDs, like, release a pound of love snot when they hear that come out of their mouths,  when they think, when someone thinks of it, oh, my God, I just got a work release program.  It's, it's going to be alive now forever. 
[02:26:00]  Every station will start stealing it.  Hog call.  Then I heard another one, um, the midday DJ was, um, doing, uh, you know, a promo for  her show.  And she was telling everyone that she's going to play Arrowsmith, um.  That day.  Oh, right.  Like, oh, okay, I'll tune in.  I'll tune in for an Arrowsmith song.  Like, promoing a song.  And it's just going to be on that day.  Pretty much the band she's going to play when she gets on, uh, later, later that day.  And I'll be playing some Arrowsmith. 
[02:26:30]  I'm going to play Arrowsmith, Phil Collins, and, uh, I don't know, Motley Crue.  All right.  Nice.  I can't guess what station that is.  What's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's,  what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's, what's.  Is it right before the Scott Muni show.  Uh, Igor from the Sopranos wants to come in and say hi real fast.  He lied to us.  He said he was going to be on.  I know.  Now, again, he's the guy that beat up Tony's, uh, sister with the fake leg. 
[02:27:00]  And then he goes, guys, I'm going to be on.  And we all tuned in to see Igor.  Igor.  Did you purposely lie to us, Igor, just to get some air time?  No, no.  But I did purposely lie to you to see girls with cream bikinis.  Well, we're hoping.  It looks like a girl down the hall that's trying to get in.  I don't know if she's here for the contest or what.  Now, you don't have to lie to sell us on watching The Sopranos. 
[02:27:30]  I mean, we're going to lie.  It's not like a show no one's watching.  And then, hey, I'll be on it.  Okay, as a goof, I'll turn it on so I can see Igor.  I'll tell you what happened, right?  The first time I was on, I called the production office of The Sopranos.  I said, count four weeks.  And that's when the next episode is going to come on to you.  So I count four weeks and then come on.  I'm thinking maybe I miscounted.  So I counted something and I wasn't on the next week.  Hey, Igor, who cares about you?  Can you bring that girl in?  I didn't bring beer, though.  That's always good, Igor. 
[02:28:00]  Always good.  Yeah, look at that.  Hey, look at that, Sam Adams.  Thank you.  You got some Sam Adams.  Well, you know, I am on a tight budget, so I bring the Budweiser.  I'm just kidding, man.  Bud's cool, too.  A lot of people say that, too.  They're like, guys, but you talk about Bud and you talk about Sam.  The fact is we like both.  All right, shut up, Opie.  What's your name?  Savannah.  Hi, Savannah.  You want to have a whipped cream bikini contest?  How many Savannahs are there on this planet?  Who cares, Ant?  Who cares? 
[02:28:30]  We got the hottest Savannah in the world right now.  Savannah, are you a dancer?  No, I'm not.  Is your real name Savannah, then?  You do magazines?  What do you do?  No, she just doesn't want her real name out there.  I think that's her name.  Oh, and you pick Savannah?  Yeah.  All right.  So, Savannah, Cynthia.  What are you doing?  You came down for the contest?  Where are you from?  Long Island.  Nice.  Long Island representing.  Where about?  Valley Stream.  Valley Stream.  Home of Jim Brewer.  Jim Brewer.  Did you know that? 
[02:29:00]  No, I didn't.  Oh, I know why.  Because Valley Stream's fake, too.  She's got like a zip-up number, Anthony.  Her name is Valley Stream.  She's from Savannah, Georgia.  There you go.  She just mixed it all up.  Can Igor unzip you?  Just so we can take a look at what we're putting the whipped cream on.  Sure.  We don't buy anything.  Sure.  Sure.  And Igor?  Oh, wow.  He won't hurt you.  Savannah, he's been on The Sopranos.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Anthony, we've got a finalist. 
[02:29:30]  Look at that.  That's going to be covered in whipped cream in the very near future.  What do you got there?  A little denim jumpsuit number?  Yeah.  Something like that.  Yeah, she's looking very retro.  Very, right?  Kind of like something that the Charlie's Angels would have worn.  Oh, very good.  Biting crime.  Yeah.  Right?  A little belt thing going and everything else.  It was kind of deceiving underneath that when it was zippered.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like you got your sporting stuff there.  Very nice rack.  And they're held very, very nicely in the white brassiere. 
[02:30:00]  Thank you.  Good observation, Igor.  Thank you, Captain Obvious.  That was good.  I am master of the obvious.  I'm just kidding.  All right.  So you're going to go out?  Yeah.  Put on your whipped cream bikini.  You're a little nervous?  You don't have to be nervous.  You seem a little nervous.  Why are you nervous?  Yeah.  I've never done anything like this before.  We're all cool.  You don't have to worry about it.  You think we've done this before?  It's obvious.  Everyone's like very cool with it and you'll do fine. 
[02:30:30]  Would you like to ease into it by maybe just, I don't know, you know, stripping down of your bra and panties in here?  Just so you feel a little more comfortable?  Because we're good like that.  Who said that, Stinky?  I think that's a good idea.  By the way, one of the contestants looks exactly like it could be Stinky's sister.  Twin sister.  And someone on opanthony.com took the morph program and morphed Stinky's face on the contestant and it's really, really funny. 
[02:31:00]  And you can barely tell when it changes.  No, it's really, really well done.  And he looks hot.  He's got a nice rack.  He's got a nice rack.  So, Savannah, what do you say?  Look, we're all nice.  Look.  We're all smiling and stuff.  Right.  Um, I guess so.  All right.  Sure.  What do you got?  Oh, she's got us.  It's a square bottle.  I would say Jägermeister.  I'm going to go with the Jägermeister.  Ah, we needed a full bottle for the machine. 
[02:31:30]  We're a little low.  The tank was low.  We've got a machine in our office that chills the stuff now.  It's getting out of hand right here.  How old the gal are you?  21.  Oh, well, can we see her licenses so we don't get arrested?  Because, um...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  She just walked down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've got to make sure.  We're very responsible radio hosts here.  Yes.  You know, I was thinking of a new promotion for you guys outside.  Oh, yeah?  Kind of give out vouchers to people. 
[02:32:00]  Maybe, like, one voucher a week to a guy.  And he has the right to touch either T or A on the street.  And he can hand in the voucher to the girl.  The girl can come back here and give you guys the voucher.  You can ask some wild prize for her.  All right.  All right.  So you ready?  I didn't realize Devin was still in the studio.  Oh.  And he's speaking like a Russian guy now.  Just kidding, Devin.  All right, Igor, if you would just...  Yeah, Igor.  Please move.  Perfect. 
[02:32:30]  Perfect.  Now, Savannah, you're feeling a little more relaxed.  It's obvious.  There goes the belt.  Little silvery thing.  Keep those sexy sunglasses on.  That'll help.  So we don't see your eyes.  Because then you'll freak out.  You'll be, like, all nervous.  Look, all right.  All right.  Let's all calm down.  Oh, don't be nervous.  Hey, let's drop the camera.  Because she doesn't want to be on.  Working perfectly.  We'll let the hidden camera take care of that.  What?  What happened?  What?  Wow.  What are you wearing?  What kind of undies are you wearing?  You know the Hello, My Name Is?  Yeah.  It says, Hello, My Name Is Muffy. 
[02:33:00]  Where did...  Sex.  And this is a shy girl.  Yeah.  I know.  Right where the path should be, it says, Hello, My Name Is Muffy.  Mm-hmm.  You know something?  I think you're going to do very well in this contest.  Man, you were covering some stuff up with that joke.  Jumpsuit.  You got a...  Can you give us a spin?  Spin around there?  Oh, look at that.  And well trimmed, too.  See?  What does it say in the back?  It says something on the back. 
[02:33:30]  Get her to wow.  Get her to wow.  Get her to wow.  Wait a minute.  Turn around.  The pleasure is all mine, it says.  And it's on the back of the little...  The G-string.  ...thong she's wearing.  And then it says, Kiss It Baby.  Kiss It Baby.  Yes.  Kiss It Baby.  And this is a shy girl.  Would you like to wow Igor?  She's been quite a while.  I've never been wowed before.  I've never gotten wowed.  Yeah, that would be nice.  She'd love it.  Oh, my goodness.  Yeah, I know.  I know it's a little...  Yeah.  A little soprano.  Yeah, he was on the soprano.  For the soprano.  Which is pretty good. 
[02:34:00]  He's also a casting director, I believe.  Yeah, yeah.  He can get you on the...  He can get you in the bottom of the...  Whatever way.  Okay.  Whatever way.  Oh, wow.  Completes the whole picture.  Everyone's looking around like, well...  Yeah.  You're looking at everybody else going, yeah, okay.  I would say that I approve of the whole package.  You like the whole package.  The whole package.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Well, Savannah, go outside the studio and have fun.  Have your whipped cream bikini put on.  Don't be nervous.  You have nothing to be nervous about. 
[02:34:30]  You got it going on.  Yo, brother.  Yo, funk soul brother.  I walk out like that.  Well, yeah, you walk out like that.  Yeah.  Everyone's cool with it.  Yeah, you can do that if you want.  You know, she brings up a good point.  Toss, it's like, yeah, you can just walk around naked.  You know, walk out like that.  Yeah.  Just an office in a working environment.  Okay, Anthony, we got to take a break.  And when we come back, we're going to qualify someone for that trip to L.A.  Yeah.

Ladies don't think we do enough for them, so this one's for the ladies.  I do have a pair of breasts.  Hey, that girl's really nice.  That blonde.  Where'd she come from?  They're coming out of the woodwork out there, Anthony.  And ladies, next week you can come down as well.  Literally out of the woodwork?  Out of the woodwork. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, most of them don't have the woodwork.  Whatever the F that means.  The wood floor.  Thank you.  Most of them do.  Yeah, you know, some of them are noticing quite the trend in the wood floor haircut.  Can I tell you something about the wood floor trend, Anthony?  Yes, yes.  When stalker Patty decides that she wants a wood floor, the trend is over.  Maybe it's time to grow back the Earth Mama Mops of the 70s.  Ladies, it's official.  Start growing it.  You know, everyone calls it the 70s Earth Mama Mops, but when you look back at the penthouse of the 80s, like as late as 87, there was some big hairballs going on. 
[02:38:30]  You know where I got the term 70s Earth Mama Mops from?  Which you give a prize, because there's a bunch of people that know where that came from.  Chris Robinson.  It was either in an interview or on, I don't know, that video they put out a while back, and he was talking about the 70s Earth Mama Mops.  70s Earth Mama Mops.  Chris Robinson, a hilarious guy.  Hilarious.

We want to thank the fine folks at Delta Business Elite.  It's a three-day, two-night trip to L.A.  Basically, we're teaming up with CBS 2 News.  Between 6A and 7A, they're playing some kind of video clip of you and I doing some kind of silly things.  A dopey thing, yeah.  And then we ask you a question about the video you saw in the morning. 
[02:39:30]  And if you're watching it this morning, you'll be able to answer.  Right.  It's called a little tie-in, little crossover promotion.  They call it a win, watch, and listen contest.  Win, watch, and listen?  Or watch, listen, win.  Stop, drop, and roll.  Stop, look, listen.  Okay, so what's the question today, Anthony?  Okay.  You're coming up with these things.  The question.  This is to qualify.  Yeah.  The winner will be announced, I don't know, Wednesday? 
[02:40:00]  Wednesday night.  Wednesday night.  And then you've got to fly, like, the next morning, Thursday.  So don't mess around with us here.  If you can't go to L.A. on despair of the moment, then forget it.  Did you fix that?  Yeah, because they've been telling everyone to listen to 102.5.  102.5, that's great.  Thank you, CBS.  We're in the same family.  You don't even know what station is.  Thank you.  Great.  All right, go ahead.  Okay, on this morning's little video clip, what did Opie hit with the boomerang? 
[02:40:30]  He was holding a boomerang.  What did Opie hit with the boomerang?  The boomerang?  You didn't throw it.  You just smashed something with it as you were holding it.  What was it?  Was it one of those crocodile dummy boomerangs?  No, it was a little survivor boomerang.  Aren't boomerangs all the same?  I don't know.  Play him a ring.  Because, you know, there's Nerf and there's Paul Hogan.  No, this was a wooden boomerang, but he didn't throw it. 
[02:41:00]  He just held it in his hand and smacked something with it.  All right, let's go to Ray.  Ray, what's going on?  Hey, how are you?  All right, bud.  Okay, I saw the commercial.  Yeah, whatever it was called, sure.  All right, what's the answer to Anthony's question?  Okay, he hit the sheep, the Australian sheep.  Yes, yes.  You have qualified for the trip to L.A., my friend.  All right, great.  Easy as that.  Hold on the line, okay? 
[02:41:30]  Okay.  All right, there goes Ray.  Ray, what's going on?  He's been listening to himself on the radio.  Effing tool.  How many more qualifiers are we going to get?

And we're trying to figure out how we can get Timmy Topless on that show.  That, I would have to give you the Pimp Hand of the Century Award, if you work that out. 
[02:42:00]  She's not allowed to talk to anyone though now, huh?  They are under lock and key now.  Wow, we just squeaked that one in.  Yeah, under the wire.  Really?  Okay.  Well, what a great way to squeak it in though, getting her naked.  Ever seen a grown man naked?  And I think we're ready to play What Did We Learn on the ONA show today?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It didn't seem very educational, but I feel people learned a lot today.  Oh, you watch.  Here we go.  Mike, what's going on? 
[02:42:30]  Here's what I learned.  Lesbians and bisexuals and nationalists called labia.  Yeah.  I learned to support weow.  Yeah.  And I learned, hey, Debbie, are you there?  This one's for you.

The first one, he owned an acronym business, whatever the hell that is. 
[02:43:00]  The second one is, when he's in the studio, we don't have any dump sheet to read on foundrymusic.com.  There you have it.  Hey, that's right.  Thank you, Rich.  Yeah, I bet you we only dumped out of the show.  Like, wow, we might not have dumped at all today.  Ooh.  Wait, how am I asking?  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  Let's go to Uncle John.  He's always good for one.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hey, Uncle John.  You enjoyed the show today?  Oh, of course I did.  I loved it.  All right.  I learned a couple of things.  I learned that the plural of piece of ass is pieces of asses. 
[02:43:30]  And thank you for that.  Okay.  And I learned that Brian Regan is actually a very vicious individual.  Yes, he is.  I watch him.  He's a closet vicious guy.  You know, we accomplished our goal finally.  We've been trying to corrupt that guy for over a year now.  It's not even today.  Because not even joking would he say anything bad about anyone.  Right.  And today, the slow people got his rap.  Yeah, he went over.  I'd like to take a minute to thank today's bikinis ladies for a good time tonight.  Oh, good.  Thanks, guys. 
[02:44:00]  There's a couple.  Talk to you later.  Very nice looking ladies.  Are we going to get them in here before we get off the air?  Of course we are.  She's waving at us.  Yes.  Come on in.  Of course we are.  Steve, what's going on?  Hey, fellas.  Hey.  Today, I learned that Buzz is the new Jay Moore.  And I also learned that Brian Regan is a hate monger and a rabble rouser.  All right.  Thank you.  F the Maple Leafs.  Look at that.  Froy checking in with what he learned.  Angela Lansbury is only worth a hundred bucks.  Ernie-O.  Ernie-O.  Ernie-O.  Hey.

I learned that Vinny the Racist is an angel compared to Brian Regan.  Yes.  Very good.  Kevin from Bloomfield.  I learned if you bring cheap beer into the studio, you get ignored.  I'm like he's laughing at us.  Oh, wait.  That was me.  Oh, wait.  Dylan.  Hey, how's it going?  Dylan.  Good.  How are you?  Funny.  Good morning.  Shut up.  I'm a cop, you idiot. 
[02:45:00]  All right.  What do you want?  Done?  Yeah, Dylan.  Okay.  Dana.  I learned that Elizabeth is a hot one, but Kimmy is an easy one.  I also learned to think he has boobs.  Later.  Very good.  Hey, why don't we get that sexy blonde in here?  We only have like two minutes left in the show here.  Jack, what's going on?  Hey, I learned that all slow people should die a terrible death.  Yeah, we apologize.  Oh, that'll hurt.  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho,

The same thing you heard on the other show.  Right.  Right.  Go back to 1987 when it might have been appropriate.  Go over there, fine young lady. 
[02:46:00]  Fine young lady.  Have the blonde hair and no brown and white hair.  And you have to now move backwards.  Tank top, what's your name?  My name is Callie.  And where are you from, Callie?  I'm from Stanford, Connecticut.  Oh, Connecticut represented.  Callie or Callie?  Callie.  Callie.  Oh, sorry.  Callie.  How are you guys?  Callie.  Very good.  Very good.  And you're here for the whipped cream bikini contest, hopefully.  Oh, good, good.  Yeah, that's always good.  What have you got on your own there?  It says love.  Yeah, it says love.  Well, it looks like a prison cat.  It does, right? 
[02:46:30]  Yeah.  I got it when I was a lot.  You know what, though?  It's cool.  Yeah.  I like that.  You know, I'm sorry to interrupt, though.  I also have a prison cat.  Igor, will you shut that up?  You have a prison cat?  Igor?  I want to show you guys.  Seriously.  Igor.  What the hell is that?  Lift up your leg.  Where did you get that?  In prison?  It was done with an electric toothbrush.  You were in prison?  No, I was not in prison, no.  But someone gave you a tat with an electric toothbrush.  Yeah.  And you thought it was a good idea at the time.  Yes.  Igor.  Go on with it.  Igor. 
[02:47:00]  You have the worst tattoo I've ever seen.  No, but I've seen some bad ones.  That's a bad one.  That's a cool tattoo.  Let me see the other one.  But it doesn't matter how many cool ones you got.  That's cool.  If you got a real bad one like that.  What drug were you on to allow someone to put the one on your car?  Two beers.  I was on two beers.  That's it?  And 17.  I was 17 years old, so.  And you thought it was a good idea?  Yeah.  I don't know why.  And when it got done, did you go, wow, cool.  Yeah, I did.  Igor, real interesting stuff.  But we got a hot blonde in the studio?  Yeah, okay.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  Can I see each other? 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Oh, Igor, you sea blocker.  Any other places?  Isn't that bad?  That's cool.  Isn't the one on the leg really bad?  Oh, I like that one.  That was awesome.  I just had us one call it in.  Uh, Ryan.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, I learned Stinky has a nice rock.  Uh, yes.  Very good.  All right.  All right, have a good meeting.  Thank you.  Uh, I meant to go to Jason.  Jason, what's up?  Yo, guys.  Hey.  I got two things.  Yeah.  All right, first, that when Stalker Patty enters the trend, it arms automatically.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, syndication with Edgar, when Edgar gets on the Sopranos again. 
[02:48:00]  Uh, Igor.  Edgar.  Okay, thank you.  He's rushing.  Who cares?  Bye.  All right.  So, can we take a peek?  Like, it's always awkward to ask the girls that.  What can we, like, sneak at?  Oh, we had a dub finally.  But, yeah.  I actually don't even like it.  Let us say that word.  Can you believe it?  I know.  God, we almost went a whole show without dumping out.  You could say T-T's.  You could say boobies.  My boobies.  Yeah, that's a silly word.  The boobies are a silly word.  Is that your boyfriend out there that looks like he's going to... 
[02:48:30]  No, that's my best friend.  Oh, okay.  His name is Craig.  Looks like he...  He actually...  You know, I don't buy that crap.  Platonic relationship.  I don't buy the guy hanging out with the really hot chick as he's my best friend.  He is a guy...  It's the famous Chris Rock bit.  Yeah.  He's the guy that just is hoping that he's...  He's waiting.  He's waiting.  He's laughing.  He's there in the glass...  He's there in the glass case in case of emergency break, glass kind of thing, waiting for you  to have a moment of...  Open up that door.  He's there in the glass case in case of...  Hey, bro. 
[02:49:00]  You want to do it, right?  He's laughing.  Well, you don't think he would want to...  And now he's walking on the wall.  Yes or no?  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Come on.  Who are you kidding?  He's a human male.  Thumbs up.  I like an honest guy.  Very good.  Well, can we see the boobies?  You can see the boobies.  Yeah?  There she goes.  Ooh, nice.  A little pink top.  Whoa.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold the phone. 
[02:49:30]  Why weren't you in our breast contest?  Hold on.  Is that...  Yeah, you can keep going.  Stop it.  Wow.  Now, hold...  Are those real?  Those are...  Those are real.  Those are real.  Wow.  You should have been in the boob contest.  The boob contest?  Yeah, we have all sorts of contests.  We have best breast contests.  Really?  Those are...  You'd have been quite the contender in that one.  Very, very nice.  Well, it's almost a sin to put whipped cream on them.  Well, make sure we use a little bit of whipped cream. 
[02:50:00]  Well, can you show Rick?  What's up?  Can you show Rick?  Rick, check this out.  Like I care Rick sees.  It just means I get to see again.  Oh, that's so bad.  You're great.  You're excellent.  No, you're...  You're all right.  Yeah, I...  She's very...  How about that?  Yeah.  Well, when can I go take a picture?  All right.  Go.  Immediately.  I'll go now.  Yeah, you can...  Wow.  Thank you, guys.  Yeah.  Wow.  I think...  And seriously, a finalist. 
[02:50:30]  I know we say it a lot.  Thank you.  I got to turn off my mic for a second.  Wait a minute.  Can I come back every Friday?  Oh, he's just breathing heavily with the mic off.  His breath's back.  Okay, I'm back.  Wow.  I didn't expect that.  She had like a pink tube top thing under her...  Yeah, it was like a pink snake skin pattern tube top thing.  Under her white...  Kind of like a man's muscle shirt thing. 
[02:51:00]  Mm-hmm.  Kind of like-ish.  Kind of.  And pulls up the...  Oh, she's back.  Hi.  What's up?  Stand up on the...  Oh, wow.  Why are we standing up on...  Because you didn't get to see everything she was wearing.  Oh, that's...  Yeah, she's got a little...  Very...  Just string, pretty much.  String.  Yeah.  And that...  Wow.  And she's spinning around.  Just when you thought the last girl was going to win the trip to Hawaii, then another  girl comes in the studio.  Yeah.  We had a lot of girls today.  You...  Um... 
[02:51:30]  We had a lot of contestants that came in today.  Yeah.  They love them.  Rick, make sure her pictures come out right.  Make them come out good.  Sometimes it's lost in the translation with that stupid digital camera.  I'm telling you.  Oh, nice little socks and everything.  All right.  All right.  We'll be joining you outside the studio as soon as we end the show.  Yeah.  Ten minutes early.  You know, guys, she always has the option.  She always has the option.  If she doesn't like the photo, she can come back and get it.  Yeah.  Even after the contest is over.  Yeah.  This contest is heating up, ladies.  So, uh... 
[02:52:00]  You have all next week to come on down.  Mm-hmm.  To qualify.  If you guys...  You know...  I'm reading instant feedback.  And we get people that say,  Guys, what's with the chicks in the contest?  You...  Are you insane?  All right.  There's a couple that might not, you know, make the mark.  But the ones that do, really do.  Yeah.  And now after you see our latest contestant,  I think you'll be very happy. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  Anthony, Tom, I learned Ben is always good to do a drink with,  and there's always someone worse.  Psycho Mark.  Yeah.  Today I learned that syndication on the ground has spread throughout the U.S.,  like Fight Club.  Thank you, Ikea boy.  And there...  I don't give a crap.  There's a lot of really good ones, but we're running out of show.  Mm-hmm.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, I learned that what Hitler did, he really shouldn't have done.  Right.  Very good.  We learned that from Brian Regan today.  Yep.  All right. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah, thanks.  Cool.  Ben, I think we've got to go, huh?  Yeah.  Okay.  Can we give some stuff away?  Yeah, we can give something away.  That would be cool.  I learned that Igor's a C-blocker.  Regan's favorite snow cone flavor is grape.  His other favorite is cherry.  Okay, Anthony.  How many can we give away?  Oh, me too.  Okay, we've got a couple pairs of tickets to see. 
[02:53:30]  Wow, a comedy legend.  This is going to be great.  George Carlin at Westbury Music Fair.  He's playing May 10th, 11th, and 12th.  Tickets for all shows are on sale now through Ticketmaster.  And the two winners today win tickets to the May 10th show.  212-757-1027.  A lot of fun today, huh?  Yes.  I want to thank Brian Regan for coming in and giving us some great, great radio today.  He was on fire.  Go see him at Rascals tonight and tomorrow night and Governors in Levittown on Long Island Sunday for two shows. 
[02:54:00]  I'm going to those shows, so I'll see you guys out there, okay?  Anything else, Ann?  Just Avni on that line, 7.  If you want.  Okay, I can go there.  Avni.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I learned that Regan does the fat boys.  That's great.  That is good.  And I also learned that college has changed Earl's life forever.  Very nice.  Take it easy, guys.  Thank you.  I'm going to live for myself.  All right.  A lot of these girls will be showing up at the whipped cream bikini celebrity softball game. 
[02:54:30]  Oh.  Kind of put that spin on it.  Wow.  Because a lot of people want to see these ladies live.  And of course they do.  No, we should do it if we were smart.  We should get the finalists.  And we should just, like, just find a club and do it that way.  Do it live.  Well, at least, you know, let everyone get a peek at them live.  You're so right.  We should do that.  Yeah.  And we'll even do a smaller place.  Just like a little three, four hundred, you know.  Ben, comment.  Ben, can we set that up? 
[02:55:00]  What do you want to do now?  We want to, like, try to, um...  We can figure it out on Monday, but it just popped into my head.  Why don't we, you know, get the...  Which way?  We'll get the ten finalists after next week.  Because the girls could still qualify.  And we'll go to a club so we can show these fine pieces of asses off.  Yeah, they should be seen in the third dimension.  Yeah.  Right.  I'm telling you, for some of these ladies, the digital pictures just don't do them justice.  Ah, we'll figure it out.  You guys, thank you.  Have a great weekend.  You know, we appreciate the support.  We'll go to the FU line as we leave. 
[02:55:30]  Igor, thanks for coming in with the beer.  No problem.  Thank you very much.  And we'll see you on The Sopranos, right?  This Sunday, definitely.  Yeah, right.  Liar, liar, pants on fire.  Are you beating up someone?  No.  Oh!  You're making me slip, huh?  I see, I see, I see the route you're going.  Are you...  I'm not going to fall for it.  I'm not going to fall for it, guys.  Are you getting whacked?  I'm not going to say nothing.  That would be so cool if we have one of the guys who gets whacked on The Sopranos in the studio.  Take a beer.  Here, here.  All right.  We got to go.  In the preview last week, didn't they say something about someone has to be taken care of that hurts somebody in Tony's family? 
[02:56:00]  Mm-hmm.  Oh, my God.  Are you getting whacked?  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Why?  Because if you're getting whacked, it doesn't matter anymore.  They can't bring you back from the dead unless you're a big pussy.  Oh, my God.  I think he might be...  Bye-bye.  You know, I want to tell you guys a funny story.  One of us at the read-through for The Sopranos, right?  There was a little girl that was playing one of the little girls or something.  And before the read-through even starts, they go around the whole circle and they make everybody say their character name and their real name. 
[02:56:30]  So, Big Pussy's sitting there, right?  And a little girl sitting right next to him.  And what's his name in real life?  Big Pussy?  Uh, blah, blah.  Let's say it's Joe Schmo, right?  Yeah.  So, he goes, uh, my name is Joe Schmo, and I play the part of Big Pussy.  And he looks right at the girl, little girl, like eight-year-old girl's little face.  And she's terrified of him.  That's hot.  Yeah.  I just felt like I would say it. 
[02:57:00]  That's been a long day.  If you get whacked...  If you get whacked Sunday, call us Monday, right?  All right, all right.  All right.  Uh, yeah, let's go to F.U. line, and guys, have a great weekend.  We'll see you Monday at 3.  Go f*** yourself.  And here's the O.P. and Anthony F.U. Friday line.  Yeah, this is Dan.  F*** you to this f***ing truck right next door to my apartment.  Waking me up every day at 6 in the f***ing morning with electric saws,  pounding and dropping bricks,  and they broke my f***ing air conditioner six weeks ago  and they haven't paid for it yet.  And their f***ing informants in truck all day  and just coffee with f***ing drunk, 
[02:57:30]  retarded Mexicans for pissing in the alley outside my window.  So f*** you.  End of message.  I just wanted to give a nice F.U. to my ex-wife.  You screwed me over with the taxes.  Now I got to pay the goddamn government $8,000.  So here's to you, you manipulating bitch.  F*** you.  Next message.  Got a big F.U. to all those shots  driving down the West Side Highway in the morning  with 15 F.U. car lengths in front of you.  Hey, let's go.  There are people behind me that gotta go to work.  I know you're not in a rush to go anywhere 
[02:58:00]  until I get paid by the hour, you MF-er.  Just f***ing speed it up.  End of message. </pre>
