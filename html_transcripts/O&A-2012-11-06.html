<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, heavily centered around the 2012 US Presidential election and the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.  The show began with Opie and Anthony recounting their experiences enduring an eight-day power outage due to the storm.  Opie hilariously detailed his struggles, including rationing Duraflame logs and a disastrous attempt to cook a Stouffer’s French bread pizza in a toaster oven. Anthony described the cold and the challenges of running a generator, criticizing LIPA's slow response and the high cost of whole-house generators.  Their frustrations extended to the election, with both hosts expressing contrasting views and launching into highly profane and offensive commentary about both Obama and Romney, Governor Cuomo, President Obama, Piers Morgan, and Candy Crowley,  alongside extensive vulgar criticism of the media’s perceived biased coverage.  They speculated on potential post-election riots and discussed social media reactions leading up to the vote. A caller from Ohio contributed to the discussion about power outages and the election.

The election remained a central theme, with the hosts criticizing the media’s portrayal of Romney, expressing fears of potential widespread civil unrest if Obama lost, and engaging in discussions about racial and political divisions in the country.  They also harshly criticized Mayor Bloomberg's handling of Hurricane Sandy and noted the perceived lack of celebrity involvement in relief efforts compared to Hurricane Katrina.  A significant portion of the broadcast featured a jingle contest, with numerous listener entries played and critiqued, including a submission from a caller named Iraq detailing the devastation his family faced in Breezy Point.  Bruce Springsteen's appearances with both Obama and Chris Christie were also discussed.  The hosts further explored the fragility of civilization and the potential societal collapse if electricity failed, before returning to election discussion and a debate about breakfast preferences, specifically the merits of bacon and the disdain for French bread pizza.  Caller Iraq was the only explicitly named guest besides the following.

A discussion about the relative merits of Ray's Pizza and Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, marked by complaints about Grimaldi's staff, segued into a bizarre and vulgar discussion about the hosts’ perceived mental ages, bodily functions, and the properties of water.  This led to a humorous contemplation of hypothetical societal collapses, focusing on the potential demise of humanity at the hands of water or bugs, and which animals might take over Manhattan. A lengthy debate ensued regarding the number of possible chess moves versus the number of molecules in the universe, resulting in a $100 bet.  The show then transitioned into an audio contest segment featuring listener submissions, ranging from musical entries (including a discussion of Stevie B's "Because I Love You") to a comedic Hitler speech.  The hosts' commentary was often crude, interspersed with discussions about the election, tax loopholes, and the listener submissions. This segment concluded with a comedic bit, "Should I Suck a Dick or Not?", featuring comedian Joe DeRosa.

A segment focused on racial voting patterns in the 2012 election, exploring statistics about black unemployment and Obama's overwhelming support within the black community.  The hosts questioned the reasons behind this high level of support, despite economic hardship, and discussed whether Obama's policies effectively served the black community. A Chris Rock comedy bit from Jimmy Kimmel Live satirizing the racial dynamics of the election was played, followed by caller contributions, including a comedic “Blacks for Romney” advertisement using racial slurs and stereotypes. Callers shared their voting choices and rationales, expressing diverse opinions on Obama's policies.  One caller compared the hosts' criticisms of voters receiving government assistance to a dog repeatedly getting sprayed by a skunk. This was followed by an interview with Ricky Gervais, touching upon his use of Twitter, interactions with religious followers, his views on the election, and his stand-up comedy career.  Gervais discussed his experience with a French remake of *The Office*, compared British and American humor, and mentioned his upcoming projects, including *Derek*. He departed the show due to a power outage at his Long Island home. The hosts briefly discussed other *The Office* adaptations before moving on.

A further segment featuring Ricky Gervais delved into the anxieties and challenges of stand-up comedy, including repeating material and the pressure of filming a special.  Gervais described the feeling of disconnection from his act when not fully committed and the exhilaration of performing new material.  The conversation touched on audience behavior, online dating experiences (including unsolicited dick pics sent to Jim Norton), and the absurdity of online dating.  Gervais and Norton engaged in a humorous and vulgar exchange about Norton’s dating habits. Gervais mentioned upcoming projects, including a Netflix show and a New York Comedy Festival appearance with John Hodgman. They discussed audience reactions to controversial comedy topics, including race, rape, and pedophilia, debating the line between offensive humor and commentary. The segment concluded with plugs for Gervais’s projects and a brief discussion of the upcoming US presidential election.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  And this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot.  Do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start. 
[00:04:00]  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  All in every day, that's what I say.  You guys are having a good time.  You guys are having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:04:30]  Would you like a man's a fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  That doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  I'm tired of these people.  Up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks. 
[00:05:00]  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do this.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Jesus.  Good morning, everyone.  It's Super Bowl Sunday here.  Hi, everyone.  Oh, yeah.  It's election day.  It's a big game.  We're gonna talk a lot about election day.  I was hoping to cover election day, maybe from the compound, do a little show. 
[00:05:30]  But I'm still without power.  Why don't you stay in the city and we'll pop on the channel later?  Yeah?  We can do that.  Because I gotta go home and vote.  Oh.  Come back and we'll pop on the channel.  Yeah, I gotta conserve gas.  Oh.  I can't be driving back and forth like that.  It's craziness.  This is fucking insane.  I can't take this anymore.  I've lost my mind at home.  You fucking pricks.  Give me power.  Even my brother, who had the tree on his house up there in northern Jersey, he finally... 
[00:06:00]  Oh, wait.  Did he get power?  Oh, no.  He didn't get power.  Never mind.  His mother-in-law got power, so he has a warm place to stay.  I am fucking losing my mind.  You've had it, huh?  I've had it.  So what?  We're up to...  It's only been eight days.  Yeah.  It's only been eight days.  Only.  When you're the guy that the power went out two minutes into the storm and you're still  without fucking power.  I gotta be honest with you.  There was a time during the storm when it hit where my lights flickered a couple times. 
[00:06:30]  I got really fucking nervous, man.  I got nervous because I live way up high.  I'm like, man, am I going to have to be walking up and down these stairs for a while?  No.  They just flickered a couple times.  I'm freezing.  Are you cold?  The fucking...  You know what?  You know the LCD displays on your fucking thermostats?  Yeah.  It changes real slow because it's cold.  It's like those old digital watches in the wintertime.  Just real slow.  Just so I could see it display 50 fucking degrees. 
[00:07:00]  48 degrees.  It's 48 in your house?  In my house.  My heat is a Duraflame log, which I'm rationing now like a fucking...  We started yesterday.  We gotta say it again.  It's the tale of two cities.  Like, me and Jimmy were never affected by this storm.  And you're all in.  I can't take it.  Let me tell you a little anecdote about last night.  And it really summed up my whole fucking thing. 
[00:07:30]  Before you say that, I gotta tell you, man.  These people and the heat in our building.  My fucking God.  Right.  I had...  Not only did I have the AC on last night, it was on high.  Yeah.  It was on high.  And I still had to put a foot or two outside the blankets to kind of...  I had to sleep on my couch in the living room with blankets all over me so I could be within  fucking 10 feet of a burning Duraflame log.  But, I mean, those fireplaces give off heat, though.  Fuck.  Yeah, sure.  What do you have to... 
[00:08:00]  Duraflame log.  What, do you have to sleep two inches from the actual flame?  Two inches or you don't feel shit.  And then the other side of your body's cold anyway?  Yeah, and then the second I get warm, I gotta run outside and refuel my generator.  It's freezing.  Wait, why don't you have, like, heaters up to the generator?  Do you know what an electric heater does to a fucking generator?  I have no idea.  That's why I'm asking.  It takes a lot of juice out of it.  It does.  Yeah, it's a fucking...  So you have to sacrifice that.  Well...  No, I'm talking about the portable heaters.  What?  Just one of those dumb portable heaters that you plug in. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know.  You should have got one of those.  Yeah?  I don't know.  You should have got one of those.  You could have plugged that in.  It'd be right next to the couch.  You'd keep your face nice and warm.  Is it really cold?  Yeah, it's pretty fucking cold.  Do you feel it?  My little toe is finally coming back to life now.  Do you feel that ache?  You know when it gets so cold it kind of aches your body a little bit?  Yeah, my lips are getting chapped.  I'm fucking...  It's just fucking cold.  Here, this kind of sums up what my nights have been like. 
[00:09:00]  I just wander around the house.  I lay down on the couch pretty much because I'm alone in a big, dark, cold house.  But I do have television, which is good.  And I got a couple of lights on the generator.  And I unplugged the bathroom light so I could plug in my toaster oven.  Nice.  So I could cook me up some Stouffer's French bread pizza.  Nice.  Styling.  Sounds good.  Now, let me tell you.  The good old days of heating things up, unmicrowavable. 
[00:09:30]  It's pretty good because it tastes better when you're cooking there.  It does take longer, though.  But, oh, it's worth it.  30 minutes.  It's worth it.  30 minutes to cook up my French bread pizza.  How much energy does that take up?  I don't know, but I heard the generator go, blah, blah, when I plugged it in.  So it's definitely burning a little more fuel.  It's in overdrive.  A little more fuel.  Just for your dumb pizza.  For my dumb French bread pizza.  So I cook it up.  I set my timer on my iPhone.  And there it is. 
[00:10:00]  I'm like, ooh, French bread pizza.  30 minutes.  I'm smelling it wafting through the cold house.  A little treat.  And a little bit of heat when I went to get it, which is nice.  So, ooh, look out.  It's hot.  It's hot.  So I pull the tray out.  I got my plate.  I put it on the plate.  I turn around.  It fucking slides off the plate.  Lance, cheese first on the fucking floor.  And you sacrificed a lot of energy.  You can't start over.  30 minutes, fucking toaster oven, cheese first, splat, right on the fucking floor. 
[00:10:30]  But you're supposed to be ready for the apocalypse.  You're the one that's supposed to be ready for the apocalypse.  Here's what.  You can't handle French bread pizza.  Dude, dude.  Here's about the apocalypse.  How are you going to handle the zombies?  Let me explain.  I have an explanation for that.  All right.  I am an on and off guy with the apocalypse.  Either there's no apocalypse or there's an apocalypse. 
[00:11:00]  Right.  The gray area apocalypse doesn't allow me to shoot people.  Oh, I see.  And get what I need through any means necessary.  Because at that point, you shoot some people and you take their shit.  This is like Vietnam.  I got one hand tied behind my back.  I can't win.  You put a gun on somebody's head.  You just make them cook your French bread pizza.  Yes.  You are wearing an army jacket basically today, so it is Vietnam.  Oh, I am decked out in my military regalia.  I see that.  Well, I knew you would be for election day.  For election day.  Yes.  I'm looking to intimidate people like the fucking new Black Panthers. 
[00:11:30]  What the?  Cocksuckers.  What the hell, man?  That sounds like hell.  A lot of people are asking why not real wood.  You want to explain this again?  You're doing the door flame instead of the real wood.  Hey, cunt faces.  Let me explain something to you.  The fucking wood that came down in the storm, it's green wood.  Mother Nature can break it.  People can't.  You can't burn that shit in a fireplace.  You got a fucking, you got a metal foundry?  I'll light that shit up.  But I have a fireplace. 
[00:12:00]  Why don't you get a cord of wood?  Someone's selling that somewhere.  There's no cords of wood.  It's easy to find gasoline.  Go on, Craigslist.  Everyone's fucking gone with cords of wood.  You think?  They're gone.  Yes.  Next year, there'll be plenty of wood.  I'm sure.  Do you think you pay enough taxes to have your power up already?  Holy mother of Christ.  You know what?  I love that my tax bill is due, by the way.  It's amazing.  It's funny that you say that.  JD in New York City, Opie, did you see Governor Cuomo losing it over the power companies on  the news at 5 p.m. yesterday?  I did see that. 
[00:12:30]  He said he's going to review each and every one of their franchise licenses.  He was pissed.  Mayor Big Gulp is impressed that Manhattan has power.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  Cuomo was very impressive on TV yesterday, but nothing will happen in the end.  No, of course not.  It'll be the same habit in the end.  He's not going to yank licenses or do anything.  He's going to hold them accountable.  What does that mean in the end?  Is he going to give them a little spanking?  Nothing will change.  Nothing will change whatsoever.  And the next time the wind blows a little too strong, all the lights will go out again. 
[00:13:00]  Lipa stinks, don't they?  Dude, we've been dealing with Lipa and whatever the fuck it was called back in the day since  we were little nobodies.  And every time there was a little wind, your lights went out.  You were just used to it if you lived on Long Island.  You were just always used to it.  And you would think, you know, fast forward 30 fucking 40 years that they would figure  out how to, you know, either cut all the fucking trees down or put the lines underground.  I'm almost hoping my power does not come on before this storm rolls in on Wednesday because 
[00:13:30]  I don't want two hours of power, yay, gone again because fucking the wind blew for this  Northeaster.  They're talking 60 mile an hour winds for Long Island.  Yeah.  You're not really sure because the storm's a little further off the coast right now?  It's supposed to track a little further east, which makes it bad for eastern and central  Long Island.  Thank you.  Right.  Thank you.  So we're talking 50, 60 mile an hour winds around the area starting tomorrow.  By the way, when my French bread pizza hit the floor, cheese down, I let off a tirade 
[00:14:00]  that would have gotten me fired from here.  Well, why do you blame those people?  I blame them for everything.  How did it fall off?  How did it fall off?  Let me tell you something.  Because when you cook it in a microwave, the crust gets a little mushy, right?  In a microwave.  In a microwave.  Right, right.  So it adheres to a nice plate.  Right.  I didn't use a paper plate.  It gets a little mushy.  It gets a little mushy.  So it sticks to your plate.  I cooked it in the toaster oven.  So it was a wonderful golden brown crispy crust. 
[00:14:30]  Nice.  Which, by the way, has no traction.  It went on the plate, slid right off like it was running away from me.  It landed.  Someone called it a guinea miscarriage.  It hit the floor.  All I saw was cheese and sauce.  Did you Instagram that picture?  No.  I got so mad.  I picked it up and threw it in the garbage.  And then I had to rip off paper towels and bend over and fucking wipe up the sauce off the floor.  You actually had to clean up something.  That's strange for you, isn't it? 
[00:15:00]  I was cursing.  You should have been eating that.  That should have been in your stomach.  Nice and warm.  I know.  I probably would have ate it.  Oh, no way.  Not cheese first.  I probably would have ate it.  No, no, no.  You know what?  You're lucky it didn't go on the rug.  Cheese first.  Ooh.  Yeah.  You know what?  I couldn't have eaten it because with the power out, my place is a disaster area.  Is it?  I'm going from outside, inside.  There's a lot of dirt on the floor.  It's like, it's just my place is not clean right now.  I haven't had the maids over.  So A, when are you going to get your power back? 
[00:15:30]  B, when is the air?  How many people are still without power out there?  I haven't heard hide nor hair from anyone as far as power goes lately.  Is it your whole neighborhood?  Yes.  Is it your whole town?  No.  It's a very specific area.  It's just your little area.  Specific area.  And I haven't heard anything.  I have not seen any power trucks in my area.  I've seen them on Long Island.  I've even seen them in certain parts of my town.  But I have not seen them in my area. 
[00:16:00]  Everything that fell down during the storm is still down.  Trees, wires, poles, transformers, all still on the ground exactly where they fell during the storm.  No one has even cut it up?  No.  It's just everything is still fucking there.  I am going nuts.  Do most people have their power back on Long Island?  Where are we at?  I think that 750,000 have it back.  250,000 are still without. 
[00:16:30]  250,000?  That's still a lot.  It's still a lot of people.  That's 250,000 households, I would assume, right?  Right, yes, yes.  Not people.  So that could be at least a half million.  That's a lot of fucking people.  Way more than a half million people without power on Long Island.  It's still a lot of fucking people.  What would be the average household?  You're talking three, maybe?  Three, four, maybe?  Average, four, maybe?  3.2?  Wow.  Something like that.  Wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Oh, yeah?  Danny, update on power?  Latest update on power, 209,000 are out of power.  209. 
[00:17:00]  How many were?  Times three-ish.  It was over a million people.  Oh, that's the total?  This is well over...  Yeah, total.  This total is still out of power.  But this means well over 600,000 people.  This is LIPA.  Oh, for LIPA.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, that's LIPA.  Well, that's 209,000 households, so...  Yeah, that's a lot of people.  That's at least three people per household.  Oh, my God.  On average.  So I opened up a can of fucking minestrone soup, dumped it in a pot, and that's what I had  for dinner last night.  Minestrone soup and beer. 
[00:17:30]  That was my fucking dinner.  All right.  But it's usually just the beer, so it's a bonus.  I know.  I actually ate.  It's like a bonus.  And then I had...  It was...  Yesterday was also...  Ah, it was a kettlebell day!  Oh, did it?  Was it yesterday?  Yes.  My trainer came over.  Thank God it was cold, though, because that was good.  It actually warmed me up for an hour and a half.  That was nice.  You're training in a cold house.  Cold house with no, like...  No music or anything.  You know what it's like to try to have just a conversation with your trainer without the 
[00:18:00]  news being on or something on the TV that you can go, hey, look at that.  You've got to converse with a human being.  I don't like that, right?  How weird is that?  Isn't that odd?  I do it for a living, but I hate it.  A little strange.  Not here, but I hate it in real life.  I took my son down to the building pool yesterday, and I go to my wife.  I'm like, you know what I'm going to do?  I'm leaving my fucking phone up here, and I'm going downstairs without a phone.  Crazy, man.  It was crazy, right?  You're insane.  I go, I know I could do this.  Did you?  And she said, good luck to you. 
[00:18:30]  How was it?  It was weird.  It was so strange.  It really is.  Not to just pick it up, see who's fucking texting.  They had a time-lapse video of people voting early, I guess, and there was a big, long line.  And they had a time-lapse of people moving.  And what I noticed, how many people are just constantly going in their pockets, pulling their  phone out.  It was the whole line was just pulling their phones out constantly.  When you look at it in fast motion like that...  It's become...  It's hilarious.  It's become completely ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  Because there's nothing on our phones. 
[00:19:00]  I'm guilty.  What are we all looking for?  There's nothing on our phones.  Something fun, exciting, something that just fucking...  But it's never there!  Gives you a little laugh, something interesting to think about.  But it's never there.  Yeah, there's hope.  Every once in a while, you get a little inkling of, ooh, a little nugget.  But in general, it's all just shit.  There's hope.  There's nothing there.  And the gas...  What are we trying to fill up inside?  I don't know.  We're looking for...  We are looking for something.  A sense of community.  Some kind of acceptance.  Some...  It's a community.  I was in an elevator leaving our gym yesterday.  There was five people all on their phones. 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  There's your sense of community.  No, it opens you up to the whole...  I got annoyed, too.  Like, I'm like, fuck people.  But then I'm like, eh, it's new.  It's like whether...  It's a few years ago.  But it's like we had nothing, especially in our age group.  Everything.  I know.  You can pick this up and talk to anybody on the planet with it.  It's an amazing device.  It's an amazing communication device.  But then you realize no one has anything to say.  Hopefully it becomes something more in the coming years.  No, I think that's just it.  Everything.  Twitter.  Sports.  But what are you looking for?  Some intellectually based fucking amazing person device? 
[00:20:00]  It's public.  They're stupid.  I don't have an answer for you.  Yeah.  I check sports scores.  I check my Twitter.  Go to my YouTube page.  I like the Twitter.  Go to Instagram.  See what kind of pictures people are uploading.  There you go.  Then I go to my flip board.  That's all that is.  Check out some photography.  You're looking for something that's more than what it is.  That's pretty much...  You just spelt out what it is.  And then, you know, I was on my phone easily six hours yesterday, probably off and on. 
[00:20:30]  I couldn't tell you one thing I actually saw that made me go,  Ooh.  Nah.  A lot of election stuff.  I'll tell you that much.  I didn't get even a ooh yesterday.  Anthony, there are generators that power the whole fucking house.  Yeah.  I know.  That's another thing people...  You know, I assume people listen to the show and read things.  How much fuel does that take?  Because the fuel thing is still a problem, right?  Here's what's going on.  Yes.  I am getting a whole house generator.  Oh, that's right.  You are.  But they have to put a tank in the ground, right?  A 1,000-gallon fucking LP tank that has to be buried in my yard. 
[00:21:00]  And then a giant generator.  Why would you do that?  Why?  This isn't going to happen a lot.  I'm not even joking.  No.  You know why?  It seems like a major hassle.  It happens all the time.  The wind blows.  Any rainstorm.  Here's what it is.  How many times...  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Hold on, hold on.  Let me break this down.  How many years have you been out there at the compound now?  Four to five years?  Going out five years, I guess.  How many times have you lost your lights? 
[00:21:30]  So many I can't count.  Really?  So many I can't fucking count.  It's so worth it.  Dude, it's every time there's a high wind or a rain.  You're a weekend with the super storm.  Yeah.  Eight days, let's say.  Yeah.  How many days for Irene?  That was the last really big storm.  That was another fucking week.  Was it a week?  Yeah.  About that.  Maybe just short.  You get those a couple days.  A couple of days.  You get a day.  You get even fucking a couple of hours every couple of months.  Wow.  It's fucking...  It's every time the winds get over 30 miles an hour. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, see, people don't understand.  This Long Island has been a problem forever.  It's terrible.  I just don't know if the rest of the country has a problem area like Long Island.  Every time the wind blows, a lot of people lose power.  And rainstorms, snowstorms, like during the winter, the lights are constantly going out.  I need...  So I'm getting a giant fucking generator that powers my entire house.  And when I say that...  It sounds just allowing you to do this?  That's just it.  There's permits that have to be fucking bribed.  But you own your house.  You gotta bribe these people. 
[00:22:30]  But you own your house.  You should be able to put whatever you want.  Oh, right.  It's freedom.  Right, right.  I bought my house.  I own the property.  I should be able to do whatever I want on it, right?  Yes, of course.  No, no, because the fucking government's gotta take their share.  How long would it power your house, that big generator?  How long would it give you complete Anthony power on the house for?  It would be a couple weeks, yeah.  That long?  A couple weeks, yep.  With a full tank.  Yeah.  But how much does a full tank cost?  Oh, it's a lot of money.  It's a couple of grand.  Oh, yeah.  A couple of grand to fill it up.  That's worth it, though.  You do the quick math.  Yeah, yeah, it's worth it, and the thing is, I could have them deliver, if it gets low, 
[00:23:00]  the fucking company comes and pumps more fucking shit in there.  Wow.  So, a giant tank, a giant, it's the size, you know the size of my pool house?  My cabana?  It's about that size.  So where's it gonna go?  Behind the cabana.  Is there room for them to dig there and put it?  Yep.  Will they have to dig up your flower bed and stuff?  I could give a flying fuck about what's back there.  Who cares?  Flowers, schmowers.  I'm only curious.  Fuck the flowers. 
[00:23:30]  I'm just curious.  I'm just curious.  Fuck about flowers.  I hate flowers.  I'm with you.  Fuck flowers.  That's not a fan of flowers.  Yes.  That's the size.  They're gonna bury a submarine in my backyard.  That's cool.  I wish it was black and they'd burn it in your hiney.  Yeah.  So, how are the gas lines?  Did you have to search out gas yesterday, or is today the day you gotta search out gas?  Uh, well, I've noticed, um, I, I do tend to drive a bit more aggressive when I have a full 
[00:24:00]  tank of gas than when I'm running out.  Right.  Uh, so I was driving a little crazy coming in today.  Um, I'm down to, where am I?  I got about between a half tank and a quarter tank of gas left.  I mean, no, a half tank and three quarters.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Half tank and three quarters of a tank.  But I think by the end of the week, the gas situation's gonna be okay, right?  It should be better.  Yeah, yeah.  Or much, much better.  Actually, one of the, one of the gas stations in my town, uh, was open yesterday.  And the line wasn't all that bad.  Not all that bad. 
[00:24:30]  Less than an hour?  Um, about an hour.  Ugh.  About an hour.  It's still weird that after a week we're saying that.  Like, after a week we're going, it's only an hour on gas.  I know.  Eight days.  It's changed.  They did say seven to, I'm not defending them, they said seven to ten days without power.  That's the, they, well.  It's been crazy.  And let me tell you something.  If this was a disaster in Ohio, fucking Obama would have been out there licking people's  assholes and shoveling himself.  He, I, and I understand, uh, the mayor kept him out of Manhattan because the NYPD needed, 
[00:25:00]  um, to be there and, and, uh, he didn't want the, the security detail and stuff.  But, but Long Island, which was devastated.  He went to Jersey with Christie.  I understand that.  Yeah, Christie gave a tour of Jersey.  But where was he for Long Island?  There are parts of Long Island, Long Beach, um, uh, the Rockaways that were devastated by,  uh, the hurricane.  Right.  And, uh, did nary a fucking peep out of that cocksucker.  That is kind of weird.  Uh, they already got New York for that. 
[00:25:30]  Of course.  This was a chance to be with a Republican.  Yes.  So he, it's all political.  He does have Jersey.  But it was about a Republican.  But it was about, and it was about Christie getting together with him and getting a photo  op with Christie.  This shit is so political.  Of course it is.  He's, he's a fucking, uh, cunt.  Well, they, they, they, they both politicize.  Oh, you know that.  I know, but fuck this guy.  You do know that.  But this time, you, you certainly could point, uh, the finger at Obama, of course.  But it's his job.  He's got the fucking job right now.  He's the guy that has the job. 
[00:26:00]  Do your fucking job.  Christie and.  Campaigning for two years, you fuck.  Christie and Obama should make, like, a cop flick, man.  A buddy film.  They love each other.  Can you think of anything this motherfucker has done in the time that he's been campaigning?  All you hear about is him campaigning.  He's got the job.  Do it.  18 months.  Unbelievable.  Every president does that one, too.  I'm pointing it out.  I, I think they gotta change that.  I think there's gotta be a strict fucking rule.  If you're the president, you can't campaign.  Sorry.  Not like that. 
[00:26:30]  Have someone else campaign.  Have your vice president go out and do it.  Or you could do it the last few months, but not 18 months.  18 fucking months.  For the last 18 months.  Of that being his top priority.  But every president does it, and you gotta think how much is not getting done, because  the main guy has to be out there to protect his job and make sure he gets re-elected.  That's his top priority.  That's insane.  For 18 months.  18 months of, of, of, of, uh, campaigning, and then whatever the fuck else.  Oh, Benghazi, four Americans dead. 
[00:27:00]  Uh, oh, I'll go to Vegas.  Right.  I, I'll go to Vegas to campaign.  I, I, I could barely do this job because I have two kids.  I can't imagine if I had a campaign.  Campaign.  And do this, and do this radio show.  Yeah, four whole Americans.  Are you kidding?  Master Queef, you're a fucking cocksucker.  Wait, what did he say?  I don't know.  Is he against me or for me?  I have no idea.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah, he's against.  Compared to 3,000 under Bush, it was a war, dick fuck.  Shut up!  I'm bouncing you.  Find another place to listen to the show today.  I'm sensitive. 
[00:27:30]  I'm sensitive.  Bye, Master Queef.  Bye.  Looks like.  I love when Anthony just fucking, just starts squashing people like bugs.  Had it.  Looks like someone's a little nervous about today, huh?  Depends on what channel you watch.  You're getting a little nervous there.  Depends on what channel you watch.  Is this going to be Christmas morning for you or what?  Tell me to defend on what channel you watch.  Wow, you just stammered.  You all right?  You're getting a little nervous.  Motherfucker.  It's going to be close.  You watch fucking.  I was watching, what was it, CNN last night? 
[00:28:00]  Yeah.  And first of all, Piers Morgan, I tweeted late.  Let that fucking lie in me.  Go back.  Go back to England, you fucker.  You don't know about this country.  Stop commenting on our election.  Go back there with your queen, you fuck.  You know what?  You're 100% right.  I hate him.  You're 100% right.  But I finally figured it out.  I tweeted last night.  His mouth is too small for his face.  Because his face has been bothering me for over a year.  He uses it, though.  Huh?  He uses that mouth, though.  Shut up.  Then he uses his upper lip to keep his teeth moist. 
[00:28:30]  I don't know what it is.  It's kind of like windshield wipers.  He uses his top lip to kind of constantly caress it.  Yeah, he's English.  He's like, he has teeth.  His teeth.  Fucking limeys.  And then I also tweeted that Candy Crowley, I got a peek of her cleavage last night.  They went to her last night.  She only had about a hint of cleavage.  But it was enough.  And people thought I said this just to get a good tweet out.  I actually threw up in my mouth a little bit. 
[00:29:00]  Oof.  It was horrendous.  It was horrendous.  She's fucking disgusting.  She's starting to show cleavage now.  I was a little upset because Jimmy doesn't respect her or understand Candy Crowley.  And other people were calling you out on it, Jimmy.  It's amazing on Twitter when you send any kind of a tweet that has any kind of...  And I prefaced my tweet by going, it doesn't...  Regardless of how you feel about Obama.  Whether you like him or don't like him, the media is shit.  And I tweeted a 60 Minutes thing where Obama had kind of admitted that he hadn't called it a terrorist. 
[00:29:30]  And I don't care if he did or didn't.  The point I did was just that during the debate, it came up.  Obama was wrong.  And fucking Candy Crowley jumped in and defended it, which is not her fucking place.  And she was wrong.  And then after she was wrong, CBS still didn't release the clip until yesterday.  My point was about the media being shitty.  I don't care if he called it terror, to be honest.  I kind of like how he's handled terrorism.  I think he's been more brutal on them than I thought he would. 
[00:30:00]  But the fact is he fucked up and that fat Candy Crowley fucked up.  So I Twitter that and all these people...  Candy Crowley, what about...  Fucking shut up!  You dumb cocks!  People don't understand.  You can be critical of someone you actually like.  Or the press!  Right.  But I'm just saying, they think you did that because you're like a rah-rah-Romney guy.  And that's the only reason you did it.  The New York Post said, all this office needs is a leader.  America must elect Romney today.  Oh, that's the... 
[00:30:30]  That's the newspaper!  How the fuck is the newspaper, which is supposed to be unbiased, and they're given a pass on content because they're journalists?  That's alright.  It just equals out the fact that MSNBC is campaigning for Obama.  Absolutely.  They're publicly campaigning for Obama.  Well, the point is we don't have true media anymore.  Because you said MSNBC is convinced Obama's going to win.  And Fox, you said...  Dude, here's what it is.  You watch MSNBC, and why would you even go out and vote as a Republican? 
[00:31:00]  There's no chance in hell of winning.  And then you watch Fox, and you absolutely...  Romney is going to win by a landslide.  And you go back and forth, and you're like, what?  What the fuck is this?  It's unbelievable.  You're not getting an honest appraisal of what's going on on either side.  The polls are biased to one or the other.  They use the polls that are biased to their own purpose.  And the only way we're going to find out what's actually going to happen is wait and see.  Do you flip back and forth?  Yes, I do, all the time. 
[00:31:30]  It's a great exercise.  All the time.  But the second my hand goes for my gun, I have to switch back to Fox.  They just say the complete opposite.  It's amazing.  It really is.  It's the complete opposite.  It's amazing.  It's not even close to the same thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Why are we still surprised?  I mean, I still am every time.  Why are we still...  I'm not surprised anymore, finally.  You still have to believe that the media means something.  I don't know why it shocks me every time.  I'm not surprised anymore, finally.  But, I mean, only in the last...  Probably this election, finally.  Because we remember when the news actually had some credibility. 
[00:32:00]  It wasn't newsertainment.  It was actually the news.  And, you know, you'd get your anchorman, who you actually, regardless of what the actual fact was, you did kind of trust him.  He was kind of an authority figure telling you what was going on in the world and not editorializing anything.  Well, remember when...  I mean, all they do is editorialize now, right?  Yes.  But remember when we were growing up, they would have the last 30 seconds of the news.  It was an editorial. 
[00:32:30]  Yes.  And you're like, wow, that's weird.  This guy's actually giving his opinion.  That's so fucking strange.  And then they would say, and if you have an opposing viewpoint, send us a postcard, we'll invite you on.  But they threw it on, basically, as their fucking news credits are rolling.  Right, yeah.  Or maybe on a weekend or something.  And I remember thinking, that is so strange.  The guy's actually giving an opinion?  Yeah.  And now that's all they do.  They don't even give you the news anymore.  No.  They should do a little blurb of news at the end of their program for 30 seconds.  Here's the real news.  They give you their opinion based on what's going on in the world. 
[00:33:00]  Right on.  Not even the news.  It's their opinion based on the news.  Right up top.  Yeah.  They don't even bother with headlines anymore before they start giving their fucking horseshit opinions.  It's insane.  Oh, Joel's in Ohio.  Joel.  Hey, fellas.  This has been the best week and a half of radio.  Anthony sounds like Fez pre-heart attack.  You know, both mentioned about being on an island.  Pre-heart attack?  What an idiot.  Going back and forth to work.  I mean, it is hilarious. 
[00:33:30]  Uh, Anthony, I have a Generac natural gas generator at home, so when the power goes out, the natural gas beats the generator.  Yes.  I don't have to gas it up.  I know.  Is that an option for you?  No, I don't have, uh, gas lines in my neighborhood.  There's no fucking gas lines.  You know why?  Because I pay so much tax that, uh, why would I have underground gas lines?  Wow.  Uh, why wouldn't I have fucking propane like some trailer park piece of shit?  That's terrible.  All that money you spend in taxes and they can't get you.  How about natural gas going to my house? 
[00:34:00]  Buried electric lines.  Shouldn't that, shouldn't he be up and running first?  Like a white man's neighborhood for the fuck's sake.  Well, he lives in a county that pays the, the most, pretty much the highest taxes in the country.  Or right up there.  And you don't, but you don't get better service.  And you still have shitty power lines that are going to fucking fall down every storm.  Yeah.  Yeah, they don't, they, ah, whatever.  That's terrible.  Where's your money going?  Oh, it's unbelievable.  Uh, we don't know.  Line in the pockets of.  Yeah, we don't know.  Thanks, sir.  Uh, did you pass Democracy Plaza on the way in today?  Democracy Plaza. 
[00:34:30]  I guess that's, uh, Rockefeller Center where they do their, um, Today Show and various  news shows from them.  They're going to do their election coverage.  That's the same place where little teenage girls cry over Justin Bieber.  Right, but now it's Democracy.  But now it's Democracy Plaza.  Democracy Plaza.  They've turned on their red, white, and blue lights.  Their, um, little, uh, white stars all over the place.  The blue, a little brighter than the red, you think?  A little bit, a little bit.  Slightly?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Slightly brighter than the red?  Yeah, yeah.  And, uh, yeah, it's Democracy Plaza now. 
[00:35:00]  Look, it's on TV.  Democracy Plaza.  Look at that.  Say look, look.  Very dramatic.  That's where Bieber fucking sings his shitty songs.  Big blue carpet, of course.  Look at this.  Look at all the blue in that fucking...  Oh, boy.  So, Democracy Plaza, you drove right through it, huh?  People are just, uh...  No, but I was ready to.  Right the fuck through it.  I don't know who I want today.  I really, I don't.  Oh, Jimmy, you're one of them.  I am, dude.  I'm an undecided.  You're an undecided?  Vote for yourself.  I have no faith in either one, I guess.  I just...  What is it going to take? 
[00:35:30]  You want to know what kind of toppings they like on their pizza?  Will that help you?  Yes.  If they like floor, I'll vote Anthony Comey.  I like linoleum on my pizza.  I don't know.  I just...  Neither one of them grabs me.  Like, both of them have things I like.  Of course.  No one...  How about I like Obama socially, and I want Romney fiscally.  I want fucking welfare socially?  No, I mean his...  More people on fucking welfare.  More entitled.  If you read these fucking tweets and stuff that are coming out from these animals that  have...  All they're talking about is their fucking... 
[00:36:00]  Their welfare cards, and we gotta vote Obama.  And if he win...  If he win...  It's...  If he wins!  Not if he win!  You fucking illiterate cocks!  Oh boy, you're panicking.  What?  You don't think Romney has this, do you?  That's not why...  You read these things?  You don't think Romney has it.  If he win, me gonna riot!  Really?  You dumb cocksuckers!  You alright?  No.  This is supposed to be a great day for you.  No, I've been looking forward to this day for 18 months.  No, I've been dreading it. 
[00:36:30]  I know he's got the edge.  I know it.  I'm not stupid.  I don't like that part of his social...  The welfare thing.  Well, that's his whole fucking basis.  It's taking people that have been successful and done stuff with their life, stripping them  of what they have, and giving it to these fucking leeches!  But if Romney didn't have this...  Like, I just don't trust...  I just don't like the fucking religious angle, even though he's not nearly as bad as...  Fuck it.  I just got more of a hatred for that.  How...  We'll weigh it out.  Does...  How old is the earth, according to Romney?  That's a good question. 
[00:37:00]  If it's 6,000 years...  I don't give a shit about his fucking religion.  How about Obama's Muslim religion?  Yes, Muslim!  Don't let him folk fake you out with this Christianity bullshit!  He's a muzzy!  I've had it!  You're losing your mind!  This proves that Obama definitely has it, because you've studied this more than anyone.  What do you mean?  You know Obama's got this.  No, I think he's got the edge on it.  I don't know how this is going to play out.  Well, it depends on Dixville Notch, right? 
[00:37:30]  Fucking Dixville Notch.  It's all about Dixville Notch.  They voted last night at midnight.  And what happened?  Five for Romney, five for Obama.  There's only ten people in the town?  Ten fucking people voted in Dixville Notch.  The news just wanted to say Dixville Notch?  But it's never happened before.  What, a 5-5?  I think the Democrats always take Dixville Notch.  What, 7-3 usually?  Yeah.  I thought it was Dix-Phil Notch, which would be, you know, appropriate, because that's what happens.  Of course, you fill the notch with your dick. 
[00:38:00]  Sex, right.  Right.  Yeah, I...  Oh, God.  Are you nervous?  Uh, yeah, yeah, it's, you know, I just, I think we're going to have four more years  of an unaccountable, and he's been unaccountable in his first four years, of a guy that is in  office, now without the need to do anything to keep his popularity up, and he is going  to dismantle the things that have made America work and made America a great, powerful country 
[00:38:30]  for over 200 years.  He is going to dismantle that because of his beliefs, because of his anti-capitalistic  ways, because of his anti-colonialism that was pounded in his head by every mentor he's  ever fucking had, his communist and socialist ideology that's been pounded in his head from  every mentor and everybody he's looked up to in his entire fucking life.  You know what's interesting about him is, like, the people, like, you hate him, and then 
[00:39:00]  there's people who are ultra-liberal that also don't, he's a big disappointment to a lot  of real liberals, because they're like, he said he was going to do this, and he didn't  do it.  Well, what about Oprah?  It seems like nobody is really satisfied with anything he's done.  What about Oprah?  Where's she?  Where's she for this election?  I don't know.  I don't see the passion for Obama this time around.  I almost made a comment that would have lost me my job.  Was it close?  Please.  Oh, it was close.  Please get us out of here.  Just say it.  No.  Oh, Jesus.  Just say it.  Let's see. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, he's writing it down.  Get the shredder.  Get the shredder.  Get the Opie and Anthony shredder.  No, that's pretty funny.  Let me see.  I don't think that I lost it.  Yeah.  It's a big one.  Wow.  That's a good one.  It's the first.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  J.D. writes, Opie, Anthony's like a cornered, rabid dog now that he realizes Romney doesn't  stand a chance.  No, no.  I'm not saying he doesn't stand a chance.  He's a little nervous, though.  This can go...  Either way?  Either way. 
[00:40:00]  It's a little more tilted toward Obama.  I understand that.  And another thing that just kills me is this fucking, this electoral college and these  fucking swing states.  I mean, he automatically starts off at 55 electoral votes just from California.  California.  Yeah, we were discussing...  55!  We were discussing California before the show.  That should be easily two different states at this point.  Oh, no, please.  You drive from San Francisco to L.A., it's two very different... 
[00:40:30]  All these...  Two very different areas.  I mean, you know, obviously a lot of liberals, but...  All the blue states are the big cities, the big urban areas which consistently vote Democratic  are in the states that have the biggest population because of these cities, and they wind up getting  more electoral votes because they got more seats.  And when you look at the lead that Obama has before you even start looking into swing  states, it's amazing. 
[00:41:00]  I mean, I understand there's a lot of red states, a lot of them.  You look at the map and it's all red and you think, oh, wow, that's a lot.  But the population is so low in these states that they don't have as many electoral votes.  Well, what does the election come down to today?  Ohio?  Florida?  Ohio, Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania's a little...  Pennsylvania is in play, definitely.  And Romney's actually campaigning today in Pennsylvania again.  They're saying that could be a very close race, too, because of Obama's kind of...  He's not really a coal guy. 
[00:41:30]  Romney is.  It's a real coal, working class state.  Some of the unions I know in the Philly area are going to Obama.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, well, Philly's another animal because it's an urban area.  Dude, it's an urban area, Philly.  It's fucking...  You know how you find out if a city is going to vote Obama?  Look at the crime stats.  Look at the top ten crime stats.  And all those cities are for Obama.  How is...  Look at this fucking map.  It's so weird. 
[00:42:00]  I'm tired of it.  If it wasn't for the Northeast, man...  Colorado, Nevada's in play.  We would never have a Democratic president if it wasn't for the Northeast.  Look at that.  It's crazy.  That's unbelievable.  Virginia, Florida, I think might go to Romney.  Ohio's a huge fucking coin toss.  What happened with Wisconsin?  What about it?  Wasn't Paul Ryan supposed to take that for him?  Well, they're traditionally Democratic, but since he's from there...  They were hoping that he could turn that around, right?  And he might...  You know...  These polls, again... 
[00:42:30]  These polls are so biased on each...  On both sides.  Both sides.  You watch CNN.  You watch MSNBC.  You watch Fox.  Their polls show different things.  The funny thing is, when they focused on Ohio last night when I was watching CNN,  man, not only were they saying it could come down to Ohio, then they started going into...  It could come down to this county, and not only is it going to come down to this county,  it could come down to these couple of little areas, these little towns. 
[00:43:00]  Little areas.  Can you fucking believe it?  I'm going to watch all day.  When did the results start coming in?  When did the early results?  I don't know.  It's not until much later.  Five, six?  They'll start speculating.  The media has gotten spanked in the past, very badly, for their early results.  Yeah, when the West Coast still has polling open.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't like that.  Who's the one?  Oh, Dewey.  Dewey wins.  Dewey defeats Truman was a biggie. 
[00:43:30]  That was back in the day before, you know, TV coverage like this.  Right.  But the press was always with exit polls and speculating and declaring a winner in a certain  state prematurely, because it does affect what people do.  Are we going to be dealing with hanging chads?  Well, some of the states...  We don't do the hanging chads anymore, right?  No.  Some of the states, though, that have been affected by the hurricane are using paper ballads,  because there's no power at some of the polling places.  I think also Cuomo has said that you can vote anywhere. 
[00:44:00]  Anywhere, any polling station in the city or the state.  Yeah.  But I'm not registered.  That means I can't vote, right?  They would know that?  They would probably know that, Jimmy.  I'm so mad at myself.  I want it to this time.  I didn't realize you needed a month.  I can't.  They won't let me.  No, just go in.  Wouldn't it be nice if all you needed was a fucking ID, and you could walk into a polling  place, give your ID, and vote?  Why can't you?  Wouldn't that be nice?  Oh, please, stop it.  You're suppressing people's voting rights. 
[00:44:30]  Stop it.  What?  Why?  Some people don't have IDs.  Why would you want people to actually give an identification to fucking vote?  Cunts.  I don't know who I want more.  I worry about Anthony's health if Obama wins.  But it is entertaining to see him so upset.  It would be terrific for this radio show if Obama was reelected.  I just want to put that out to our listeners that are undecided.  In Pennsylvania and Ohio?  No, because Chris Matthews with a Romney win would be a lot more entertaining. 
[00:45:00]  We've lost all hope for the country.  We've lost all hope.  I don't know what the American people were thinking.  He would start the revolution, though.  If Romney wins, I think Chris Matthews would start the fucking revolution.  You don't seem to have something.  What happened?  Correct.  I, contrary to some people's belief, am a white person.  I will not start a revolution.  I will not riot. 
[00:45:30]  I will not do anything detrimental.  I will express my opinions.  I will not be happy.  But I will go along, work every day.  I won't go crazy.  I won't fucking riot.  I know where you're getting at.  Do you think people really are going to riot?  Here's my prediction.  And you might not know it if Obama wins.  But if he does lose, you will absolutely see rioting in a lot of the big cities. 
[00:46:00]  NBA championship title shit?  Rodney King shit.  You are going to see Rodney King level rioting in the cities.  Not NBA championship title shit?  Dude, they've already threatened it.  Because when an NBA team wins, they like to fucking flip a car or two and burn it.  You're saying way worse than that.  Way worse.  You are going to see, if you read Twitter and other social media, there's plenty of people saying... 
[00:46:30]  Worse than O.J.  Verdict?  No, they loved O.J.  Verdict.  Oh, you mean with all the white people that rioted during O.J.  Verdict?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's right.  None.  The hypocrisy is astounding.  Oh, people were talking about how Chris Matthews, that dickweed, again, was saying how Obama was disrespected.  Was disrespected.  Do you remember that?  How Obama was disrespected and Romney treated him with disrespect and disrespected.  And the president of the United States said, yeah, it should be illegal.  And the Constitution says you're not supposed to do that. 
[00:47:00]  Was he outraged?  I want to pull some audio of him when that series, That's My Bush, came out.  When Bush was president.  And they were parodying and goofing on the president of the United States on television.  Did Chris Matthews come out at the disrespect that went on for that?  Chris Matthews is a weird, groveling white guy.  He's an asshole.  It's like the ultimate guilty white guy where it's like they have this really weird thing with black people.  Like, he doesn't want to criticize them because somehow that's racially insensitive. 
[00:47:30]  The white guilty people disgust me more than the criminal fucking gangsters.  Imagine they did an Obama show like That's My Bush.  Oh, That's My Obama? Could you imagine trying to pitch that?  Hey, I want to pitch a show.  It's called That's My Obama?  They'd wind up screaming out of the fucking room.  They'd be running.  I got a clip.  Your boy, Jay-Z, I know you're a big fan, did a little something-something for President Obama. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, man.  He had the superheroes on the stage yesterday.  Oh, did he?  He had Jay-Z.  He had Springsteen.  Jay-Z.  Who else did he have yesterday?  They had Clinton helping him out yesterday.  Of course.  But this is what Jay-Z did for Obama.  And I changed this one up.  I have to do it.  I'm sorry.  I didn't get clearance from the Secret Service.  So if they come tackle me on here, y'all save me.  Yeah.  I changed the laryngan.  Hold on, wait.  If you're having world problems, I'll have a bath for you, son. 
[00:48:30]  I got 99 pounds, but mid ain't one.  Oh, there you go.  Chip like that.  The fucking guy is great.  Chip loved it.  Fuck, instead of Chip ain't one, he said Mitt.  No, no.  It's the bitch.  Wow.  So he's, you know, taking out the bitch and putting in Mitt.  That's a big time bomb right there.  If Obama loses, I'ma start a riot.  All right.  That's good.  If Obama doesn't win tomorrow, I'ma start a riot. 
[00:49:00]  I'ma start a riot.  You read that one already.  If Obama don't win tomorrow, who down to riot?  Niggas gonna riot if Obama doesn't win tomorrow.  If Obama doesn't win, we gonna start a riot.  That's how you spell it.  Oh, God.  Do you love this?  G-O-N.  Wow.  If you want more, it's pretty easy to find.  Oh, I know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Keep going.  They just...  The fucking...  And Jay-Z.  Yeah, that's...  Class act, Jay-Z.  That's good that Obama's fucking attached himself to that fucking criminal. 
[00:49:30]  Wait, wait.  Here we go.  A little more.  Matthew, son.  I got 99 pounds, but mid ain't one.  That's horrible.  I wish the Secret Service opened up on him right there.  Y'all help me out.  If you having girl problems, I feel bad for you, son.  I got 99 pounds, but mid ain't one.  I got the rap patrol on the guy patrol.  Foes, they want to make sure my cats get closed. 
[00:50:00]  Strap pretty's face.  Why?  It's a cool song.  Shut up.  It's a good song.  I'm trying to rap along here.  All right.  Money cash out.  I'm from the hood, stupid.  What type of facts are those?  And you grew up with holes in your sabatoes.  You can celebrate the minute you was having, though.  I'm like, this is a village.  You can use my whole ass.  If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  Hey, where are the white women at?  You and the black ass.  Let me grow up.  I don't know what you take when you ask. 
[00:50:30]  I'll understand the intelligence of the Jay-Z house.  I'm from Braxton, rich, thick, signed, dumb.  I got 99 pounds, but mid ain't one.  Hit me!  Yeah!  99 pounds, but mid ain't one.  If you having world problems, I'll come back with you, son.  I got 99 pounds, but a bitch ain't one.  Oops.  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  Holy shit!  Well.  Hey, where are the white women at? 
[00:51:00]  I love the song.  Fuck that shit.  God damn.  This fucking fascination with the criminal culture.  You motherfuckers.  Man.  What?  You're gonna be okay.  You're gonna be okay.  So sick of it.  Four fucking years.  This fascination with celebrity and this bullshit.  This guy's done nothing but campaign, try to keep his job, make excuses for why he's done shit.  He's done shit! 
[00:51:30]  I think I'm gonna take tomorrow off.  I'd rather have a president, I'd rather have a president in there that in four more years will, again, be accountable.  Be held accountable.  At the very least, if you vote in Romney, at least he'll fucking have to be accountable in four years to keep his job.  Obama, he's done.  He could do ten times more damage in four years than he's done.  I don't know why I don't like, I don't hate Romney, I just, I don't know why, there's something about him I don't like, and I don't know exactly what it is.  Too white?  Nah, I don't mind that.  I'm pretty white.  The problem here is this should have been very easy for the Republicans. 
[00:52:00]  Man.  Yeah, I think they fucking blew it, man.  He's too, no.  He just doesn't say what he, like, I wish he would say what he means more, that's all.  I wish Romney was a bit more firm and, like, embrace the thing, like, if you did healthcare in Massachusetts, don't just trash Obamacare because you gotta, just say the parts of it you like and then bash the rest of it.  When you have every news organization, except for Fox, literally campaigning for you.  That's true.  You cannot come out looking like the man you want to present yourself as. 
[00:52:30]  No.  People were surprised during the debates.  Fucking surprised that Romney wasn't a fucking vampire that came out.  They were like, wow, he actually is articulate.  Holy shit.  Because the press has presented him as a buffoon or someone out of touch, as somebody that can't fucking speak.  Like, I don't like that he won't go on certain shows, though.  I mean, I love it.  No, I love it.  It just, even though he's blowing them off and going, fuck you, it makes him look weak like he doesn't want to have, like, you can't handle Letterman? 
[00:53:00]  Like, Jesus, dude.  No, no, no.  It puts him in a situation where it's a losing scenario.  It's a no-win scenario.  How the fuck is he supposed to go on there and then have those organizations, NBC, CBS, cut apart every word he says, unlike they do with Obama, and use it against him?  Because that's all they've been doing.  Instead of airing like CBS did not air Obama fucking saying, or not saying, that Benghazi was a terrorist attack. 
[00:53:30]  Like, they finally released that?  60 Minutes?  You fucking biased cunts?  I want to go back to the debate.  You made a pretty good point there.  But the fact is, we didn't see that version of Romney for most of the time.  How are we supposed to see it when the news won't show it?  All of a sudden, he popped on this debate.  It's like, wow, that's the same guy we've been kind of looking at for the last year?  Obama was getting ten times the coverage on network news than Romney was getting. 
[00:54:00]  You weren't allowed to see it.  I don't know.  They weren't breaking away for Romney's speeches on fucking MSNBC or NBC or CBS.  They were on Fox, though.  Oh, of course they were.  Fox gets huge ratings, sir.  Yeah, well, you know what?  They kick MSNBC's ass.  They kick CNN's ass.  When you're battling with every other fucking news organization, it doesn't quite fulfill the void.  We got more riot tweets.  Yeah.  Obama riot tweets. 
[00:54:30]  Oh, God.  There it is, Ant.  If Obama does not win tomorrow, the world will erupt with confusion and anger.  People will riot the streets.  Be safe.  Well, that sounds more like a warning than a threat.  If Obama lose...  Oh, you fucking non-fucking...  If Obama lose, it's going to be the biggest riot in history because I'm going to start it.  If Obama don't win, we're going to start a riot. 
[00:55:00]  Feel like niggas going to riot if Obama don't win.  I feel like a riot going to pop off after we find out who win the election, LOL, because  I got a feeling Obama might not win.  If Obama loses, I hope people riot.  See, there's this underlying feeling that if Obama doesn't win, that it will be necessary for black people to riot in the streets. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Have fun.  Have fun.  It's going to be a long day.  Oh, my God.  Could you imagine this for another election?  Like, people tweet...  Well, if Twitter existed.  Like, if Dukakis doesn't win, I'm going to start a riot.  Right, right.  Well, no one...  Yeah, a bunch of Greeks.  I mean, no one...  No one wanted Dukakis.  No one...  Bad example.  That guy was horrible.  Well, you know what I'm saying.  But there has never been this threat like this, that if one side wins or loses, that this violence will break out.  The nation has never, ever been more divided. 
[00:56:00]  And I blame it directly on Obama, his policies, this entitlement that the black community is feeling now, that is so separate.  There is such a separatism going on in this country.  It's ridiculous.  It's not going to get better anytime soon.  No.  No.  The next four years.  Not until some people get off the fucking government till and start assimilating to society.  That ain't happening. 
[00:56:30]  No, of course it's not.  Hey, by the way, Bloomberg was elected mayor 11 years ago today.  Jesus.  Why is she?  It's election day, and he's had the job for 11 years.  11 fucking years.  He started before we came to satellite radio?  Yeah.  Wow.  He was in office before he got fired from NEW.  Holy fuck.  Remember, he didn't want Rudy to have a third term.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, yeah.  But she went and got one for herself.  And then put a vote to it so no one else can get another term. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah, he's a cocksucker.  He voted to get a third term.  He actually didn't put it up for a vote, by the way, to get the third term.  He went to internally and had them decide that he could have a third term.  Didn't go to a vote.  But then it was voted upon to have term limitations after he won the election.  Jesus.  So now no one else.  He just.  He's a fucking.  Amazing.  He's a fucking cocksucker.  And all you need to know about Bloomberg is that I think everybody should run. 
[00:57:30]  I think the race should continue.  That's all you need to know about that cocksucker.  He really hasn't done a good job with this super storm.  Governor Cuomo stepped up a bit.  But Bloomberg.  Ugh.  Yeah.  He stinks.  Oh, God.  There's Springsteen on stage with Obama.  Look.  Yeah, there you go.  And Chris Christie got a hug from Springsteen.  He's really happy.  I kind of like that about him.  He's just such a fat super fan of Bruce Springsteen.  He's like Roland. 
[00:58:00]  Wait, wait.  How were they in the same room yesterday?  I don't know.  They went to a benefit.  Probably for Jersey or something.  It was a benefit.  Yeah, but Springsteen was with Obama.  So then why does the paper also have Christie hugging Springsteen?  I'm confused.  Or was that from?  Because Christie said he cried after he got home that he got a hug from Springsteen.  Because Springsteen, he's a super, he's been seen him a hundred times.  No, I know all that.  Sure.  No, I know all that.  Springsteen took a plane.  So this is two separate days.  Yeah, yeah.  Or two separate places.  Two separate places.  People can fly places.  No, but it's in the paper is one story today that Springsteen was on stage with Obama. 
[00:58:30]  And then they also, well, that's probably the paper being a little clever to make you think, oh, what the fuck's going on here?  Was Christie at the Obama rally?  Well, he got a hug and they said Springsteen wouldn't even acknowledge him for a long time because he's so politically opposite.  And then.  Fuck Springsteen too.  But I'm just saying that.  Fucking asshole.  Liberal shithead.  Fucking Jay Moore's take on Springsteen yesterday.  It was classic.  Can we find that real fast?  I know you weren't here, E-Rock, but maybe somehow find that.  Maybe we could play that at the break. 
[00:59:00]  He just broke down the whole band and what Springsteen does on stage.  It was classic.  You're not a big Springsteen fan?  Yeah.  Fuck him.  You got to go to a show.  Have you ever been to a Springsteen show?  Yeah, I went to the Apollo Theater.  Oh, duh.  It was good.  During one of those shows where you could actually sit in your seat and not have to jump up and fucking look over people's heads that are bouncing up and down in their chairs.  It was pretty impressive.  Had it.  Pretty impressive, huh?  Well, Springsteen on that stage?  It actually was. 
[00:59:30]  I can't front yo.  All right.  Want a break and eat and shit?  Yeah.  Had it.  Fucking crap.  90-time problems and chip ain't one.  That was pretty hack, wasn't it?  For a guy that's close to a billionaire, that was a little rough to listen to.  Oh, billionaire?  What is he?  One of the 1%?  He's way up there.  He's got to be worth it.  Of course he is.  A few hundred million easy.  Like all these fucking...  Where are the celebrities for fucking Hurricane Sandy, by the way?  Where's fucking all the celebrities that came poking their fucking faces in with Katrina? 
[01:00:00]  What?  All of them.  Where are they?  You didn't see the super concert on NBC?  Holy shit!  That thing that was held in a walk-in closet with fucking ten people?  Fuck them.  Where's Clooney?  Where's fucking Sean Cunt Penn?  Where are all these cocksuckers that were there for Katrina?  Simon Cowell gave $25,000.  $25,000.  $25,000.  Nice.  Wow, look out.  What a lousy...  What was that, on his dresser? 
[01:00:30]  Do you know how much that guy makes a year?  Fucking 50 or more, probably.  $75 million.  When you break it down per day, he makes $208,000 a day.  Nice.  I've had it with Hollywood, with these celebrities, with liberal fucking media, with fucking Obama,  all these fucking pieces of shit that have done nothing so far but tear down the country  and make things difficult for anybody that wants to actually work for a living.  Please, Obama, win.  Please, please, please, please. 
[01:01:00]  Please, Romney, please.  Please, please, please.  If you're a Republican out there, please, I'm begging you, and especially the people that  are in these swing states.  I know you can hear me.  If you're not going to vote today, please take the fucking time.  Get up there and just vote.  If you're a registered Republican, please get up.  Just take the two seconds.  It's not a big deal.  And fucking vote.  Please.  I'm begging you as a listener of this fine program.  For all the entertainment I've given you. 
[01:01:30]  I'm not saying weave because you guys don't agree with me.  I'm not stating a point of the Opie and Anthony show.  Just the Anthony portion.  Just go.  Just fucking go out.  Find out where your polling place is.  If you're a registered Republican, please don't just sit home.  Go out and vote.  Please, I'm begging.  Begging.  Thank you.  All right.  We'll do more of this after the break, I guess.  Big day.  Vice President Biden at the ballot box right now.  What, they get to vote nice and early?  Ah, whatever. 
[01:02:00]  Whatever.  I'm eating.  Well, the Democrats' way of running this country is to go tell us all how we ought to  make sacrifices.  God, they're great on that stuff.  But they're all going to have us over the hill to the poorhouse.  We ain't going to be able to drive over there because we ain't got no gas, so we're going  to have to walk it.  Well, the Reader's Digest says walking is very good for you.  Oh, ain't that lovely.  The Reader's Digest can always put a little joy into poverty. 
[01:02:30]  My whole pain is this whole thing with the energy and everything.  This is all a conspiracy.  Don't you know that?  There's a conspiracy there.  Listen, for years, all our lives, they've been telling us to go out and buy stuff that  use energy.  You know, all the electrical stuff.  Look at your electric toasters.  Electric ovens.  Electric stove.  Electric stereo.  Electric TV.  Electric race.  Electric hairblower.  Electric knives.  Electric every damn thing.  Not to mention the cars.  And now, after all the big corporations there make the billions and billions of dollars 
[01:03:00]  worth of profits, signals.  Wham!  They're changed.  And they're telling us for years that we can't live without this junk.  Now they tell us that we gotta live without it.  The country is going straight into the dumper.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Now, there's one thing you might have noticed I don't complain about.  Politicians.  Everybody complains about politicians.  Everybody says they suck. 
[01:03:30]  Well, where do people think these politicians come from?  They don't fall out of the sky.  They don't pass through a membrane from another reality.  They come from American parents and American families, American homes, American schools,  American churches, American businesses, and American universities.  And they're elected by American citizens.  This is the best we can do, folks.  This is what we have to offer.  It's what our system produces.  Garbage in, garbage out.  If you have selfish, ignorant citizens, if you have selfish, ignorant citizens, you're 
[01:04:00]  going to get selfish, ignorant leaders.  And term limits ain't going to be any good.  You're just going to wind up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans.  So maybe, maybe, maybe it's not the politicians who suck.  Maybe something else sucks around here.  Like the public.  Yeah, the public sucks.  There's a nice campaign slogan for somebody.  The public sucks.  Fuck hope.  Fuck hope. 
[01:04:30]  Because if it's really just the fault of these politicians, then where are all the other  bright people of conscience?  Where are all the bright, honest, intelligent Americans ready to step in and save the nation  and lead the way?  We don't have people like that in this country.  Everybody's at the mall, scratching his ass, picking his nose, taking his credit card out  of his fanny pack and buying a pair of sneakers with lights in them.  So I have solved this little political dilemma for myself in a very simple way. 
[01:05:00]  On election day, I stay home.  I don't vote.  Fuck them.  Fuck them.  I don't vote.  Two reasons.  Two reasons I don't vote.  First of all, it's meaningless.  This country was bought and sold and paid for a long time ago.  The shit they shuffle around every four years, doesn't mean a fucking thing.  And secondly, I don't vote because I believe if you vote, you have no right to complain.  People like to twist that around. 
[01:05:30]  I know.  They say, well, if you don't vote, you have no right to complain.  But where's the logic in that?  If you vote and you elect dishonest, incompetent people and they get into office and screw everything  up, well, you are responsible for what they have done.  You caused the problem.  You voted them in.  You have no right to complain.  I, on the other hand, who did not vote, who did not vote, who, in fact, did not even  leave the house on election day, am in no way responsible for what these people have 
[01:06:00]  done and have every right to complain as loud as I want about the mess you created that  I had nothing to do with.  So, I know that a little later on this year, you're going to have another one of those  really swell presidential elections that you like so much.  You'll enjoy yourselves.  It'll be a lot of fun.  I'm sure as soon as the election is over, your country will improve immediately.  As for me, I'll be home on that day doing essentially the same thing as you.  The only difference is when I get finished masturbating, I'm going to have a little something  to show for it, folks. 
[01:06:30]  Thank you very much.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I want to start by reading an instant feedback.  Do we still use instant feedback?  What?  I barely look at this fucking thing.  What the hell is that?  It looks just antiquated.  It's a valueless screen.  It's horrendous.  Marion, I guess she's not on Twitter because most of us look at our Twitter accounts. 
[01:07:00]  Of course.  Marion in the Outer Banks, a place I like, writes, Opie, please change the subject.  I don't want to have to change the channel.  I can't listen to Ant's rants.  I'm loving Ant's rants today.  He's losing his fucking mind.  Oh, sorry that on election day.  Right.  And one of the biggest elections in recent history.  Right.  Sorry that we're talking about the election.  That's all anyone else is talking about today.  That's what it is.  People are just all about it today. 
[01:07:30]  The apathy of the shit fucking country.  Maybe three or four months.  And I mean the people in it.  Maybe three, four months ago, maybe we should have changed the subject here and there.  Maybe.  Whatever.  Yeah.  But not today.  Today it's all about the election.  It's the election.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  I sure hope she's a registered Democrat and just doesn't go out and vote.  Yeah.  Good.  Good.  I've been to the Outer Banks.  I would assume they're very, very Democratic. 
[01:08:00]  Very.  Oh, I'm sure.  Very about the Democrats.  Oh, I'm sure.  Oh, good.  Good for you.  Any place that allows me to shit on their beach, they have to be a little left leaning.  She's worth less than that load of shit you left on the beach.  All right.  Now what?  You know what we haven't delved into in a while?  What?  Racism?  The jingle.  No, racism.  We don't have the disc yet.  Oh, we don't?  No.  The track list is being printed up. 
[01:08:30]  It's in.  Do we have some good ones?  I certainly hope so.  I do, too.  Who's leading this thing?  Iraq?  The Iraq.  Iraq's in the lead?  You made a piece, Iraq?  The one about Iraq is leading, I'm thinking.  I think that one, right?  Iraq on me, nigga?  Is that how they say that?  Iraq, how are you, buddy?  How's your family?  I'm doing good.  What's the matter, Iraq?  I don't like the fact that the shine has gone out of your smile.  Well, it turns out Iraq's family was in the, what area is that? 
[01:09:00]  Bell Harbor?  Bell Harbor and Breezy Point.  Breezy Point, which just got completely destroyed.  His family has laid roots there for many, many, many years.  Because it's one of those communities you can't get in.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You have to already be in.  Yeah.  It's one of these weird communities, right?  They don't let a lot of outsiders in.  It's a co-op, they call it.  What do you mean it's a co-op?  It's a residential co-op.  So the people have to decide if you could move into that neighborhood?  Yeah.  You own a piece of the neighborhood.  Residential co-op.  Yeah.  There's not a lot of those out there. 
[01:09:30]  I guess God doesn't like those things, huh?  Jeez.  Finger of God.  Finger of God.  So Iraq, his family lost a lot of houses there.  Oh, man.  A lot, right?  Some aunts, some uncles.  Four houses.  Four houses.  One is completely off the foundation.  They don't know where it went.  They don't know where it went?  No, it's gone.  They haven't found it yet?  No, it was the...  That house was on the coastline. 
[01:10:00]  Like, you came out of the house, the beach is right there.  That house is completely gone.  That's that price you pay for that cool shit that you get to live in for, you know, when  there's not a hurricane.  Yeah.  Is the fact that, yeah.  You basically forget that you're on...  When you're on the beach, you're on the lip of the ocean.  Like, it's 75% of the planet, and there's no force that can stop it.  And yet you're right there.  Like, I want to just look at this.  It's literally like fucking living under a hornet's nest and just waking up with honey 
[01:10:30]  on your mouth every day.  Terrible example.  If you look at it, if you look at it in these terms, if you zoom out and really look at  the earth and the oceans and the coastline, think of how close you are to the ocean.  And your house is right there.  Your house is so close.  And all it takes is a little bloop of the ocean.  A lot of these houses, you see a couple hundred feet of...  Look at that.  You see a couple hundred feet of a beach in front of you between your house and the 
[01:11:00]  ocean, so you're thinking, oh, that's plenty of room.  For the ocean, though, that's literally nothing.  They laugh at that shit.  Hey, look at my view.  What is that out there?  Why, that's the most powerful destructive force on earth.  That's what that is.  I like to frolic in it.  I want to live right near it.  Yeah, look at what it would take for the ocean to even wipe out the entire, like, Long  Island.  It's nothing.  Bloop.  Well, you talk about oceanfront property, but you're right when you start looking at 
[01:11:30]  the whole thing.  The big picture.  I'm surprised it doesn't happen more often.  One day, the ocean will just take Long Island.  How does the ocean stay where it is for as long as it does when there isn't a storm?  It doesn't really.  I mean, it's always moving.  The geography of the earth is always changing.  So, I mean, when you look at old school, you know, like Pangea and things, like, how could  you expect the coastlines to remain the same throughout your lifetime?  You would think every week the ocean would be, like, 50 feet up that way, 1,000 feet  back, another 2,000 feet forward.  Well, that's what it does.  Because it's giant.  And then as human beings, we continue to try to rebuild it. 
[01:12:00]  I mean, like, every day it should change like that.  The moon keeps it in check.  It's okay.  No, 1,000 feet one way?  Yeah.  5,000 feet the other way?  Yeah, in sections around the world.  It should be wiping out the coastline every day.  It's too big to have such a narrow variance of its wave line.  Right.  Like, it's so giant.  When you think of how slightly it moves on the coastline, it really is amazing.  It's in high tide, and it's moved 10 feet.  Right.  It's 75% of the planet.  Huge. 
[01:12:30]  We are very lucky.  It's a lot of water.  Literally, every once in a while, the earth should just go, like, burp, and the fucking  Atlantic should cover the entire continent.  I can't move a pot of water off the stove without it spilling on the floor.  Or a cheese pizza.  Take it, Sadie.  Oh, no!  I was thinking it's a break, Jim.  Jimmy.  That's my pizza.  I was devastated.  I couldn't be happier.  Oh, I knew you would like that, by the way.  So is Long Beach going to rebuild?  Are the Rockaways going to rebuild?  What's going on down there?  I don't know. 
[01:13:00]  We need Laszlo to give us an update.  He actually lives there.  Right.  Let me see, Danny.  And that little thin island is going away.  Every storm, it's taking a little piece.  That was the corner between the Jersey Shore and Long Island, where the water just pushed  into, and there was nowhere for it to really go.  And it just went right over the islands.  And that's where Iraq's family is, right there.  Crazy point.  Right there.  Long Beach.  The Rockaways got fucked. 
[01:13:30]  When you look at the tsunami, it's basically the two plates slip, and the one plate slips,  pushes the water.  Yeah.  That's just a little plate rubbing, and one just goes, and the water goes, 200,000 people.  Yeah.  Or even worse is, not even worse, but even more amazing is a hurricane is nothing more  than taking the water and going, pfft, on it.  Give a little, give a little, uh, breathe on it.  Pfft.  And it made a ripple that kind of went up on the shore. 
[01:14:00]  Sure.  It's amazing it doesn't happen more.  It's horrible.  Amazing.  But, so what are you going to do, Iraq?  What is the family going to do?  Are they going to rebuild?  Comment?  Uh, we're waiting to see about my sister's house, because they're not allowing you to  do anything in Breezy Point right now.  The water still hasn't fully gone away.  Why don't you just do a cannonball in everyone's yard?  That is the most difficult way to work in a fat joke.  I know.  It was kind of funny, though. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah, it was a good one, Iraq.  I could see the service you would provide.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  They pay him.  He goes to the next house.  Going from house to house.  You got to tip your belt to Anthony on that one.  I'm just kidding, Iraq.  Well, they're waiting for the water to go away, but isn't someone's water going to  stay forever?  Ever.  A lot of it has left.  It's just, there's about maybe a foot or less still there.  Some of these areas, they got to start naming new ponds and stuff, right?  That water's not going away.  Oh, boy. 
[01:15:00]  And new inlets, right?  Someone showed me a video where they cut through another section there on Long Island.  Fire Island got fucked up, too.  A new fucking inlet.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that shit doesn't go away.  Does anybody actually, is there a hotel on Fire Island, or is it just a, uh...  Oh, Jesus.  I'm sure it's the no-tell motel.  Another inlet.  They're like, oh, good.  I thought there was only one or two, actually, with a mouth.  Jesus.  I've never been there.  Fire Island? 
[01:15:30]  Never.  Oh, you'd love it.  Why?  They have the Miss Fire Island contest out there every summer.  It's where, uh...  Oh!  It's all of your beautiful trannies having a beauty contest.  When is that?  In the summer.  During the summer.  How have I never been to the Miss Fire Island?  You go to Cherry Grove, and it's just wonderful.  But I want to go there.  I don't want to go...  Let me see.  Miss Fire Island.  Oh, she's...  What a delightful...  You want to look at the past winners?  Of course I do.  I probably know half of them. 
[01:16:00]  Oh, my gosh.  I should have congratulated you when you came over.  Jesus.  Oh, man.  Here's Miss Fire Island 2011.  Oh.  Let me see.  Please.  I can't see them all.  They just don't have...  They're drag queens.  They're not trannies.  Well...  Big difference.  Is there a big difference?  Of course there is.  That looks silly.  Oh, okay.  Big, giant arms.  Well, their trannies are gussy up for the...  Miss Fire Island.  They're not transsexuals.  No?  No.  They're just...  They're just silly guys. 
[01:16:30]  They're just silly guys.  Yeah, the guys having fun.  No, look.  That one has implants.  Ew.  Oh, boy.  Oh, she's not a charmer.  No.  Let me see her.  I like her style.  She's got some pizzazz, this girl.  Jesus said.  They're not girls.  One of my cousins won that years ago.  There you go.  There's one.  One of my cousins won that years ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What?  It's like one of my cousins removed from, like, my dad's side of the family.  I'm talking, like, way back in, like, the fucking 70s or 80s or something.  Yeah.  I like you more. 
[01:17:00]  Anthony.  His name was Anthony.  What is it now?  I don't know.  Antoinette?  I don't know.  I don't even know if he's still alive.  Who the fuck knows?  Did he have a resemblance to you?  No, not at all.  He was, like, a weird, different part of the family.  I remember every time we went to visit, though, my father would look and go,  Jesus Christ.  I gotta fuck her.  Yeah, dad wasn't too fond of Anthony.  No.  I knew.  In any way, shape, or form.  No.  No tolerance whatsoever? 
[01:17:30]  No.  Especially on the drive home when he would kind of talk to my mom about Anthony.  Would he drop the F-bomb?  My mom would be like, you know, oh, it was so nice to see the family and everything.  And she'd mention Anthony, and my dad would be like, oh, yeah, I saw her.  Yeah, because this was before he was even dressed like a chick or anything.  He was just really gay.  Wow.  Really gay.  Well, you know, I think it's nice that Miss Fire Island is a big contest they have. 
[01:18:00]  I can't believe I've never gone there.  I just ruined it on my favorite contestant.  There's a few this year.  There's a few areas of Fire Island that are, you know, heterosexual.  That's where I go.  Fawn and shit.  Yeah, I hear you.  And then there's just the blatant gay areas that are really gay.  Is it expensive?  Yeah, it's not cheap out there.  You know.  I wouldn't mind.  They didn't have hotels, right?  I literally have no idea.  Not really.  They got, like, summer rentals out there and stuff you could do.  Wasn't Robert Moses part of Fire Island?  It's that whole stretch?  It's that stretch, but it's out a little further east. 
[01:18:30]  Where is Fire Island?  Like, what's it next to?  Fire Island is.  What about, like, the only part, like, Davis.  South of Patchogue.  Davis Park?  Where you used to do the boating.  Davis Park.  That's all Fire Island, too, right?  Yeah, yeah.  We used to go to Watch Hill and Davis Park.  Is that the section you're talking about?  That's the hetero section.  If you go a little further east, you will get to Cherry Grove and whatnot.  Because usually, I've never even...  That's small.  Well, that's even the bigger part.  If you go further east...  Small.  There's a lot of houses there.  Where's this transsexual...  Go east of, like... 
[01:19:00]  That's Cherry Grove right there.  Right in the middle where it belongs.  Yeah, look at that.  You don't know which way to go.  And they got a little club.  That's where the trannies hang out in the middle.  Yeah, that's your Cherry Grove.  That must have got devastated.  Oh, you're dragging a little man.  Jimmy, he's dragging a little man.  So you can see.  But they don't have all, like, the full street view, so it's only user-submitted photos.  I don't want to disappoint James.  Well, that's one of the bars on Cherry Grove.  And one of the places, of course, the seats are not set up right.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  I got it.  See, they turn them upside down. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, well...  Damn, Fire Island's pretty fucking long.  Yeah, yeah.  How many miles is that?  Like, 30 miles?  It's the whole barrier beach for Long Island.  It separates the bay from the ocean.  And you see all those cut-throughs?  That's, you know, storms did that.  Those are the channels, and the storms did that, yeah.  And they just keep doing that.  And they make new ones, and then it erodes the coastline off the bay, too, because that  gets affected by the storms because Fire Island's gone.  You think anybody's fucking, anybody's house got wrecked in Fire Island?  Oh, yeah.  A lot of them did.  And Dune Road always gets fucked up. 
[01:20:00]  Dune Road has a couple new inlets over the years, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a biggie.  Well, we got some jingles.  Mr. Jingles.  You guys want to hear some jangles?  Yes.  We got a jingle contest.  The Superstorm kind of threw us off our game for a while.  We got a jingle contest thanks to IHateStevenSinger.com.  How much money again?  Oh, that fucking douche that doesn't say hi to anyone.  Is that who that was?  You know who it is, Jeremy.  I don't say hi to anybody.  Oh.  That one.  I cut my losses around this jerk.  Oh, that fucking zelch. 
[01:20:30]  I'll never acknowledge him again.  I literally hope I walk in one day and he's grabbing his chest and hitting the floor.  I won't acknowledge him.  What's his problem?  He's a cunt.  For what reason, though?  I understand some people that I want to say.  To quote Alex Rieger, he's a broken toilet of a man.  I guess he was talking about Louie.  Louie.  The greatest.  One time he said, this broken toilet of a man.  And then there was a time he said, this canker sore of a man.  Oh, is he funny?  What's wrong with that guy?  We have him coming in, I think, Judd Hirsch. 
[01:21:00]  We're trying to get him in.  Well.  Hopefully that happens.  I love him.  My David.  So how much for the contest again?  $2,000.  Two Gs to the winner of the jingle contest.  You only have a couple days to get your entries in, right?  Friday?  Noon Friday.  And then next week we'll focus a lot on the jingle contest and try to figure this shit out for everybody.  But we got new entries today.  Yes.  I've gone through a lot of entries.  And hopefully these are good.  Your judgment kind of gets clouded after you've listened to so many bad ones.  Oh, boy.  You know? 
[01:21:30]  You don't have confidence, do you?  No, I do.  But I've brought in some that I thought were really good before and you guys were just kind of like, eh.  Then again, you haven't been in your house in eight days.  Yeah, in eight days.  Here's Melanie with her entry into the jingle contest.  I love Mrs. Roberts.  It's going to be fine.  Strat fan, this is going to be an embarrassment.  I love her on A because the show is just full of love.  I don't know, dickhead, because I don't know what was going on that day, fuckface.  They always tackle the hard-hitting questions. 
[01:22:00]  How do you get a year's tampon back in?  Do you see Rabbits?  The Opster.  The Aryan.  The Appliate.  The show's on five days a week.  It's a great show, yeah.  Holy shit.  Take us out, you no-talent piece of fat garbage.  I like it.  I do, too.  It's very silly.  Not a jingle, but a very fun mix.  Well, it's an audio contest.  Yeah, it is.  Everyone pointed that out to us.  We keep saying jingle, but it's like an O&A audio contest at this point. 
[01:22:30]  It's fun.  I like that one, Melanie, wherever you are.  Yes, and good luck on your roller skates.  I got it.  SNL ripoff from Rob Fissel.  Rob Fissel's entry.  It's Saturday Night Live with Chip Chipperson.  That don't make no sense.  Kenan Thompson.  This don't make no sense.  Chip Chipperson.  That don't make no sense.  Kenan Thompson.  That don't make no sense.  He's right. 
[01:23:00]  Fucking a home run.  And Kenan Thompson.  That don't make no sense.  Fucking a home run.  And now, here's your host, Jim Norton.  Maybe you guys could use that one next week, you cocksuckers.  Saturday Night Sleep Fest.  Double bombs.  That's pretty good.  A little example.  A little example of their thievery.  That fucking makes me...  If I hear another one like that, I'm going to go over there and fucking be upset.  Come back quietly. 
[01:23:30]  That one was a little too close, don't you think?  I know it was, of course.  Go over to Democracy Plaza.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It don't make no sense.  How does he make that unfunny?  I know, right?  Oh, boy.  I can't stand this.  Want another entry?  Want another entry?  Oh, boy.  This is Sean Mikrowski.  Huh?  I'm just looking.  Anthony's preoccupied.  I can't look at the television.  I can't look at the television.  What happened? 
[01:24:00]  Because I'm just seeing.  Even with the sound off, I'm watching like CNN and MSNBC,  and it's just...  What channel will you be watching tonight?  They're visually biased.  Which one are you going to watch?  Visually biased.  Fox all the way?  No, I'm going to have to switch back and forth.  I'm going to have to.  I can't just...  You know, if I watch Fox, I'm going to be gravely disappointed  because they're just...  You know, they're celebrating a Romney victory as we speak.  Right now, balloons are coming down on Fox.  They're like, ha, they're playing Hail to the Chief and showing Romney. 
[01:24:30]  It's amazing.  And then actually on MSNBC, they have Romney in a coffin.  It's amazing.  Don't even try to vote for him.  He's dead.  It's fascinating.  We should have guests on today that are talking about this.  We should have Sean Hannity and try to get Chris Matthews.  We should get some of these guys on our show today.  Oh, yeah.  Chris Matthews will come on in a second.  Hey.  I don't understand this.  Hey.  What happened?  I've totally lost faith in the American people.  I've totally lost faith.  Hey. 
[01:25:00]  Pulling the last bit of his gray fucking tuft out of his head.  I can't believe it.  Sean McCrowski's got this for the audio contest.  Hey, McCrowski.  This is the Opie and Anthony show with uncensored silliness.  What do you think of that?  This is the Opie and Anthony show with little Jim Norton.  And E-Rock is fat. 
[01:25:30]  E-Rock is fat.  He stops to eat his food when he's in the mood.  He stops to eat his food all the time.  He stops to take a rest in the middle of the show.  He stops to take a rest and he hears us yell.  Wake up, E-Rock!  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:26:00]  Uncensored silliness.  What do you think of that?  This is the Opie and Anthony show with little Jim Norton.  And E-Rock is fat.  E-Rock is fat.  I think we got our winner.  I like that.  It's very good.  It's well done.  It adheres to the original.  And it makes fun of E-Rock.  Wait, it adheres to the original.  What is that a parody of?  Oh, my God.  I reckon.  We are the dinosaurs. 
[01:26:30]  Marching.  Oh, I didn't even catch that.  Marching.  I knew it was an addicting little beat.  How did Jimmy not know that?  Really?  That's the dinosaur song.  What do you think of that?  That's why I was like,  We are the dinosaurs.  Marching.  Marching.  We are the dinosaurs.  E-Rock is fat.  Yeah.  There you go.  I was enjoying that.  Can I not rock out?  Oh, my God.  That was stuck in my head.  We are the dinosaurs.  Can't rock out in this fucking studio anymore.  Marching.  We are the dinosaurs.  What do you think of that?  We are the dinosaurs. 
[01:27:00]  Marching.  Marching.  We are the dinosaurs.  We make the earth flat.  We make the earth flat.  This was in the,  She was in the building recently.  Really?  Yeah, well, she might not have come in  because of the storm.  I would love to.  Something, Becker her name is?  For what?  Lori Berkner.  She goes to a metal channel?  She does stuff over at Jazz.  No.  Yes.  Really?  No.  I didn't think that.  Do you have it on the Boneyard?  What do you think of that?  I actually had to use that song this morning 
[01:27:30]  to get the Manfredi car song out of my head.  Which one?  The Manfredi way.  The Manfredi.  Oh, God.  It's terrible.  That Manfredi fucking song.  Now I can't remember  because I have the dinosaur song stuck in my head.  But it's like the fucking Manfredi song  drives me crazy.  And they shoehorn in the location.  I don't know the song.  I hate it.  Find the Manfredi song.  It starts off like,  It's a kettlebell day! 
[01:28:00]  It's a car dealership, right?  Yes, it's a car dealership in New York.  And the Manfredi way.  It's the song.  While we find that,  Marianne wrote back from the Outer Banks.  Remember we gave her a little trashing?  Yeah.  And then I just checked my Twitter  and everyone's trashing Marianne from the Outer Banks.  She's written back.  Oh, did she?  What'd she write?  Well, you're going to be surprised.  She writes,  I feel honored, Ann.  Oh, really?  I am just over the election.  I received 14 political calls yesterday alone. 
[01:28:30]  I love you, Ann.  Good for you.  Okay, thank you.  I haven't gotten one of those political calls.  I haven't either.  I haven't either.  Were they focusing on like swing states?  I guess.  That's exactly it.  Although where Marianne lives is not a swing state.  We don't matter.  We don't matter.  Do you want to rock out to this?  Yeah, yeah.  This is the song that's stuck in my head.  It'll stick in your head.  All right.  Oh, my God.  Is this local?  And look at the last line.  They shoehorn in the location on what boulevard they're on.  It's hilarious.  Don't ruin it.  It sticks in my head.  The Manfredi Way.  We do the right thing every day. 
[01:29:00]  The Manfredi Way.  Come to us and you'll drive away.  With a smile, the Manfredi Way.  There's no better way to say it.  The Manfredi Way.  Stop by and see us today at the Manfredi Auto Group.  Get your car, the Manfredi Way, on Highland Boulevard today.  Highland Boulevard today.  When you're ready, go to the Manfredi.  That's why you like this commercial.  No.  What an ugly kid they got.  They got like his daughter in there or something.  When you're ready, go to the Manfredi. 
[01:29:30]  That's a fun commercial, man.  I was getting ready for work this morning.  The Manfredi Way.  Highland Boulevard today.  No power, no heat.  Pizza on the floor.  Pizza on my floor.  Singing the Manfredi song.  The Manfredi Way.  Would you rather have the $500 guy screaming in your face?  $500!  Cash!  I hate that motherfucker.  Let's go to Brian in Massachusetts.  Brian! 
[01:30:00]  Yo, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Dude, I have to listen to We Are the Dinosaurs with my two-year-old daughter every day at least  ten times.  Oh, God.  We are the dinosaurs.  Oh, it's terrible.  And then play it on guitar.  Yeah.  Well, that happens, you know.  You get that kid shit stuck in your head, unfortunately.  I liked that.  Sure.  Ricky Peehole!  You had a head of your dick.  What?  Get stuck? 
[01:30:30]  Oh, sure.  You said that kid shit gets stuck in your head.  Yeah, it does.  The fecal matter.  How'd that get in there, Mr. Hoggis?  I don't know.  That prankster.  He put it in there while I was asleep.  Oh, God.  I woke up.  He was riding it like a cowboy.  He said, get off of there.  Get that snug bottom off of there.  God.  Quit trying to milk my life-giving juice. 
[01:31:00]  James Wirth has an entry into the Opinion Anthony audio contest.  James Wirth.  Here's his entry.  This is a dangerous group that we're dealing with now.  I got a tree.  Oh, my God.  I got a tree on my house.  What's that?  Sorry, help me.  Say something.  I'm trying!  Give me more.  I'm on the radio.  You mind your fucking business.  I hope this fucking AIDS piss in you there. 
[01:31:30]  Swebs.  Anthony.  I'm wearing an 80s feather earring and I ride a unicycle.  Everyone is an intern.  It has production value.  The guy knows how to fucking put something together.  That's for sure.  James Wirthless.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Play on his name.  All right.  Well, maybe you'll like Yoshi in Tampa better.  Really?  What's he going to do? 
[01:32:00]  Well, it's titled Water, so I can only imagine.  I like the concept.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Travis is already defending himself.  No.  Well, we haven't even heard it yet.  What's going on?  Well, you're panicking.  No, I'm not panicking.  But what you guys don't know by listening to hundreds and hundreds of these is that 90%  of these people have the same idea and they're all bad.  Like it's either make fun of Eric or Jim loves trannies or Anthony loves guns.  So when you get something that's dealing with something else, it's refreshing. 
[01:32:30]  Okay.  I gotcha.  I gotcha.  Let's check it out.  Yoshi in Tampa.  Water.  Join us weekday mornings from 6-ish to 10-ish with Greg Hughes.  I was trying to figure out water on vacation.  Water's pretty fucked up if you really start looking at it.  Like it doesn't make sense.  If you really like, all right, you think about water for maybe a minute.  But no, now think about it for two minutes.  It's five minutes.  All right.  This is great. 
[01:33:00]  Holy shit.  And I am still not smoking pot.  You know, it seems that sometimes.  That's fucking great for two minutes or five minutes.  Oh my God.  I can't listen to that.  That's really good.  Let's go back.  It doesn't make sense.  If you really like, all right, you think about water for maybe a minute.  But no, now think about it for two minutes and five minutes.  Try to think about water for 10 minutes.  It'll fucking freak you out.  Yeah.  What is it?  It doesn't make sense with the rest of the shit that we live with.  And it's 75% of the planet. 
[01:33:30]  Anthony Cummings.  The molecules slow down.  In water, they're like, whoa.  They're all fast.  And gas, they're like, wah.  And then in water and liquid, they're kind of like, whoa.  And then in solid, they're like, brr.  And James Norton.  And don't forget to tune in on Saturdays for the Joe Rogan Experience on the Obie and Anthony channel. 
[01:34:00]  It's either blue cheese with wings that go fuck your mother.  Why is he sucking up to Joe Rogan in the middle of our fucking contest?  What happened?  We all love Joe Rogan, but what the fuck?  That was pretty funny, man.  If I could edit these, I would.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Of course.  You know who my water shit's funny, man.  Yeah, that is pretty funny.  Glad I'm not losing my mind.  Two minutes, five minutes, ten minutes thinking about water.  That was hilarious. 
[01:34:30]  That was uncomfortable.  And now we got Andy's entry into the Obie and Anthony audio contest.  It's called Untitled.  I got a fat white name, Susan, too.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  And I got a time rock face.  Rock face, rock face.  I'll be in the gym. 
[01:35:00]  Wow.  What happened?  What a lump of shit that was.  Fuck, dude.  What happened there, man?  You should be embarrassed.  Why was he playing Linger?  I don't know.  What the fuck, right?  I think he'll like the next one.  Yeah, we're going to do it after the break, though.  Because I've got to take a fucking leak.  Let's all just go to the bathroom.  Let's all have a leak.  Let's all have a leak.  We've got another five or six entries after the break, certainly.  I think we should do a song contest, though. 
[01:35:30]  I tell you, we've gotten a lot of songs.  This is leading to an Obie and Anthony song contest.  People got the ability.  There's two at the end.  We can't officially do a most offensive song contest, but we certainly can do an Obie and  Anthony song contest.  I've gotten a lot of songs.  I've gotten a lot of raps.  That can lead into some areas, if you know what I mean.  I think we've got to do that soon.  You want to play that to break for you? 
[01:36:00]  On Highland Boulevard today.  With the ugly kid?  Then you're ready.  You think that's the owner's kid?  That's absolutely the owner's kid or niece or whatever the fuck it is.  But what an ugly ass girl.  Oh, yeah, it is a girl.  She looks like she's all right.  No, she's an ugly kid.  She most certainly is not.  Oh, Jesus.  As far as kids go, I'd give her a six.  No, don't you hate her a six.  As far as kid cute goes, she's a three.  Don't you hate when they point like that? 
[01:36:30]  That's always bad news.  That kid's a three.  I'm like, how come these other guys who look like me are standing here?  What do you mean there's someone behind that mirror?  I bet it's a snitcher.  A snitcher.  Hey, liar, quit pointing.  I didn't tell you to want that candy so goddamn bad.  Little Manfredi kid.  She's probably already got hairy armpits.  No, she don't.  Little Manfredi.  Her feet stink when she gets nervous. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, God.  Running around the showroom all day.  Ugh, she's ugly.  She's not ugly.  Look at them little braids in there.  I gave her a heart necklace.  She's got a nice little heart necklace.  She's not bad.  She's an ugly kid.  It took me an hour and a half to put it on.  She's aight.  She can't speak properly.  Nothing special, but she's aight.  She's a little dolt.  I was putting a necklace on.  It took a while.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Here's a necklace for you.  Leave the little Manfredi kid alone. 
[01:37:30]  I just gave her a necklace.  Quit pointing.  Bad girl.  Well, E-Rock's got something great for the break.  Why don't we go to break?  We'll do more of the entries after this.  The OPN Entry Channel on Sirius XM.  We're barely out of the jungle on this planet.  Barely out of the fucking jungle.  What we are is semi-civilized beasts with baseball caps and automatic weapons.  And this civilization of ours that we're so proud of, this civilization with its so-called 
[01:38:00]  civilized behavior, you ever stop and realize how fragile all this is?  How easily it could all just break right down?  Just break right down.  It wouldn't take much.  It probably happened in less than two years.  It wouldn't take much to throw us right back into barbaric times.  All you'd have to do would be eliminate electricity.  That's all.  But completely eliminate electricity.  So, no electricity, no lights. 
[01:38:30]  You're back to candles and lanterns, campfires and bonfires.  Batteries couldn't be recharged.  Generators couldn't be refueled because fuel is pumped electrically.  So is water, by the way.  So, no lights, no fuel, no water, no computers.  And computers run everything.  And among the many things computers run and that operate on electricity are security systems.  It's in all of our jails and prisons and nuthouses.  So, suddenly, without electricity, all across America, the gates and cell doors of penitentiaries 
[01:39:00]  and mental institutions would fly open.  And out would come all of our old friends.  The ones who've been away at camp.  Serial killers, mass murderers, felony rapists, armed robbers, carjackers, home invaders, thieves,  burglars, kidnappers, sadists, pedophiles, sexual predators, pimps, pushers, pornographers,  speed freaks, crackheads, sick junkies, all the ethnic street gangs, black, Spanish, and Asian gangs, 
[01:39:30]  Japanese Yakuza, Russian mafia, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, Sicilian hitmen, Italian mobsters,  Jamaican and Colombian drug gangs, and those are just the ones we caught.  Let's not forget their counterparts, still on the outside right now, waiting to hook up with their prison buddies so they can start a new organization,  the American Federation of Sociopaths.  Just what the country needs.  Just what the country needs.  Another special interest group. 
[01:40:00]  Eight to ten million of them would be, counting all the parolees and all the probationers and the ones who've never been caught.  Eight to ten million, bitter, angry, violent, sexually hyperactive alpha males with nothing to do.  No hobbies.  No medications.  No scruples.  Just a bunch of bad guys looking for a good time.  Maybe dropping by your house.  Hi.  Hope we're not intruding.  Got any beer? 
[01:40:30]  Oh, good.  Well, I got about 1,400 really thirsty guys here.  How about women?  Got any women?  Oh, just your wife, huh?  Well, I think we can make that work.  Now boys, there's a lady here, so I want you to mind your manners and wait your turn.  Police wouldn't help you.  They'd be gone at the first sign of trouble.  They'd be home protecting their own families.  So would the Army and the National Guard. 
[01:41:00]  You'd be alone.  You'd be on your own.  You'd be SOL and JWF.  Shit out of luck and jolly well fucked.  After a couple of years of living like that, beheadings would be the least of your problems.  People would be lining up to be beheaded.  So let's get back to suicide, which now seems like a reasonable alternative.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the OP and Anthony Show. 
[01:41:30]  And you're right.  Amazing.  That should have been on the radio.  I don't feel like redoing that one.  Neither.  Fuck it.  Just discussing the election and who's better for us personally. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  You can look at it.  You'll always look at it personally, locally, and then you kind of spread out into the other  people and how it affects them.  I think that's how a lot of people vote.  Tell you the truth.  You'd like to think you vote for the country as a whole.  That is a part of it.  But you always are going to look more locally.  Who's going to help you out.  To yourself.  Yeah.  I was telling Ann during the break that the country has to decide what the fuck it wants.  It's schizo.  You elect one guy and he puts all this shit in place and then the next guy comes along 
[01:42:30]  and goes, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Breaks all that down and starts over.  That's what happens every four to eight years.  We're schizo as a nation.  We don't know what we want.  When you have a half the population likes you and half hates you, then you're going  to switch back and forth and people are going to tear down what somebody did just because  the other people didn't like it.  It's unbelievable. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  It just changes drastically every four to eight years.  Yeah.  I don't know.  By the way, we are eight minutes into the election day.  A bunch of states open up the polls at eight o'clock Eastern.  And MSNBC has already declared Barack Obama winner.  Wow.  Zero point zero percent of the precincts.  Wow.  That was fast.  Their projection is for Barack Obama.  They're celebrating like crazy over there at MSNBC election headquarters. 
[01:43:30]  Well, look at Fox.  Fox declaring Mitt Romney winner.  The balloons have already dropped.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  And they're Democracy Plaza.  Right.  Whatever it's called.  Democracy Plaza.  Democracy Plaza.  Shut the fuck up.  You don't like that name?  No, it's so stupid.  Stupid Fat Al Roker was in waist high water just a mere week ago.  Shut up.  Democracy Plaza.  Yeah.  Boy, the talking heads as they call them. 
[01:44:00]  They are out in force today.  Can I just...  All of them got red and blue states in front of them.  Maps.  They're pushing buttons.  The states are changing colors.  But more importantly...  Yeah.  How good is fucking bacon?  Fucking...  I had to take a break today.  I've been on a bacon roll.  Kenny came in this morning.  He's like...  Eggs again.  Eggs again, Anthony.  And I'm like...  No.  I can't do that.  I've been on a bacon roll.  I'd love to.  Bacon, potatoes, and eggs for breakfast every morning.  It's fucking fantastic.  My excuse was, because of the super storm, you know, maybe eat bad. 
[01:44:30]  Super storm.  Maybe eat bad for a little while.  That's what I was thinking, too.  Eight days later.  I'm eight days in a row with bacon.  I was thinking that, too.  It's like, I don't know why, but that's an excuse.  Look, I'm eating bacon for the people that still don't have power.  When everyone has power, I'll fucking stop eating bacon.  Yeah, there you go.  Because then I know we're back to normal.  But until then, I'm eating bacon every day.  I probably could have eaten bacon because I didn't eat French bread pizza last night.  I don't like French bread pizza, by the way.  Dude!  When you were telling that story, it's not my favorite pizza. 
[01:45:00]  It is like napalm on the roof of your mouth.  You can never wait until it cools off.  Yeah, terrible roof.  What does it do to your floor?  Fucking Jimmy.  I hate you.  I'm so happy.  The whole house, it's so cold and sterile.  And the smell of the French bread pizza was like it filled the air.  It almost made it warmer.  Show me French bread pizza.  It's great.  The one with the crust is a little fucking...  It's a French bread.  Yeah.  It's delicious.  It's a little too much work.  It's very refreshing.  I like my pizza to be a little thin. 
[01:45:30]  Thin crust.  It kills you with reflux too.  The reflux is awful with fucking French bread pizza.  Thin crust pizza.  It's a perfectly sane food to eat.  Did it look just like that?  No, I don't like the French bread.  It's too much like...  It didn't have pepperoni on it.  It's bordering on deep dish, dare I say.  No, because it doesn't have those big tomatoes on top.  A little too thick.  Nah, don't have them big tomatoes on top of it where you're biting into what seems to be miscarriages.  Drop down your pizza pie.  That's crispy, crunchy. 
[01:46:00]  Did I...  I went to that pizza joint in Brooklyn, under the Brooklyn Bridge.  Oh yeah?  Oh, Ray's.  Which one?  Yeah, Ray's Pizza.  Original Ray's or famous Ray's?  Famous original Ray's.  I went to the original fucking Ray's place, man.  Yeah?  Good shit?  No.  What's the new one under the Brooklyn Bridge?  Rolling with...  No.  And I gotta tell ya.  Very, very overrated.  Under Brooklyn Bridge.  Is it gonna be some pizza?  Travis knows.  Well...  Overrated.  It's just like any pizza place in the city. 
[01:46:30]  But there's a line and, you know...  Where'd you go?  Grimaldi's?  Yeah.  And the staff was complete fucking dicks.  Well, that's part of their charm.  Is that part of it?  Yeah.  What do you mean?  No, like...  They're purposely assholes over there?  No, but they're known to be like, don't expect the staff to be nice.  No, they weren't nice at all.  I hate those places.  They actually weren't nice at all.  They were like...  They were bothered that I wanted another fucking pie.  I've never...  No pizza for you!  One year!  We call it pie here in New York.  They were bothered because we went through one and were like, you know what? 
[01:47:00]  Let's do another one.  And they were fucking bothered that I ordered another...  Fuck you.  Another pie!  Grimaldi's?  All of a sudden, the waiter never came back and then another guy started sort of taking  care of us.  Get a fresh pie right out of the oven and then just throw it, cheese first, into someone's  face.  Ah!  That would hurt.  It's good.  It's not like you're walking out of there saying, oh, that was the best pizza I've ever  had.  Is it better than Joe's?  Because John's and Joe's are different.  Joe's is right up to six.  I love John's.  I've never had John's.  Cock in the West Village.  Joe's is good too. 
[01:47:30]  What?  What are you throwing there?  He said, I love John's.  And I said, cock.  Yeah.  Because I'm immature.  That's funny.  We're just...  What age do you think we really are?  Seriously.  Let's think about what age we...  What age do you really think we are?  Mid-50s?  No, no, no.  Mentally.  Mentally.  Seven?  I want a real number.  I don't want to be 13.  13.  Reflected on this show...  13?  Yes.  I'd say we're a little higher than 13.  I know you would, but I'm saying 13.  No, no, no. 
[01:48:00]  I would say, based on our sense of humor, all the dirty sex talk...  We're definitely not in our 20s.  Fart humor.  13 only?  Shit like that.  Yes, 13.  Yesterday, Danny and I went in the bathroom...  I was about to say that.  And Danny goes to one of the urinals, and I just happened to look in one of the stalls  and there was a floater.  And I'm like, Danny, come here, come here, come here!  He points at him, we're both going...  13.  Definitely 13.  No, I think this is open for discussion on it.  13?  Yes.  I would say a little higher than that.  Not much.  13, you're already thinking about a job and shit like that. 
[01:48:30]  You're not higher than that.  15?  I wasn't thinking about a job.  So maybe 14, because you're also thinking about girls.  No.  But you're also like duty humor.  Yeah, exactly.  It's all about bonkers and duty.  You're talking first year of junior high school-ish?  No, I won't budge.  13.  You really think we're just 13?  Yes.  Yes.  You talk about girls?  I think we're a little higher.  And you're very immature about it?  Yes.  That's how you talk about when you're 13.  Yeah, yeah.  Because we do try to discuss real topics.  Exactly.  And it fails miserably every time.  I say 13.  13.  I say 13.  I was going to put us around 15. 
[01:49:00]  I know, but...  13?  Sure.  13.  We'll compromise.  You say 15, I say 13.  We'll say 12.  14.  That's it.  No.  I'd lose, man.  I'd lose, man.  I would say 15-ish, but a lot of people say 13 in this room.  But we've got to break it down.  What is the 13-year-old thinking about?  Boners and duty.  But they're not poopy?  Poopy?  Poopy?  And water in the ocean for hours?  I think about it, really. 
[01:49:30]  Water is pretty fucked up, though.  Water?  It's fucked up.  Look at it.  I'm not going to let this go.  Look at it.  How is it not cloudy?  Whoa.  How is it always not cloudy?  Well, it is in my fish tank.  It's cloudy.  Pour out that bottle of water.  It just kind of disappears.  It's fucking weird, man.  It just kind of disappears.  Look, you get a wet...  It kind of does.  I'm just going to go like this.  You get a wet spot for a while, but then that just disappears.  It'll disappear. 
[01:50:00]  Where's that now?  It goes in the air.  All right.  It evaporates.  You don't find that fucked up?  It is pretty fucked up.  Throw a couch on the ground.  That's not going to disappear.  In time.  Put a booger on it and it will not.  It's amazing.  On a molecular level, it's a lot more understandable.  Yeah, but that's stupid.  I know.  To think that way.  But that's where you can understand where it goes.  I like to think in a very basic way.  Why it does what it does.  That's just dumb.  That's science.  Science is stupid.  Much like a retarded person.  Science is stupid.  A caveman probably did the same thing. 
[01:50:30]  Of course.  He threw water and watched it go into the dirt and then took a rock.  Ugh.  And then just watched it bounce there and then just scratched his head right big.  Ugh.  And then like a million years later, he figured it out.  They were just boggled.  A million years later and he was trying to figure out why a couch doesn't evaporate into  his carpeting.  What's going to be our demise?  Water or bugs?  I would think water first.  You think water over bugs?  Bugs?  That's a problem for the world in general these days.  I think we're becoming smart enough as humans that we'll be able to fight the water.  We fought the bugs already.  Not really. 
[01:51:00]  The water just beat us.  Not really.  Water kicked our ass.  Not really.  Not really.  It wasn't bugs that moved people's houses.  It irritated us but it didn't fucking beat us.  Bugs never moved houses.  And they always show how the fucking New York City is going to be when the water rises.  But we're never going to get to the point where we don't start acknowledging,  holy fuck, we've got to do something.  Yeah, you think calves will be like sitting there still in two feet of water and go,  maybe I should just leave it here.  Well, that's what I hate when they go, this is what Manhattan will look like.  And they show like a cab in water.  No.  Before then we'll figure it out. 
[01:51:30]  Make the walls bigger and shit.  You do know what bug would take over the planet?  Ants.  No.  Aphids.  What?  Those soft-bodied little things?  Aphids.  You're just biased.  No, I was going to say BSC-phids.  What's an aphid?  An aphid is, I believe ladybugs eat them or weird little bugs eat them, but I forget  the-  Well, let's not fuck with the ladybugs.  The rate that they reproduce.  But they're so tiny.  Is astronomical.  No. 
[01:52:00]  Those dumb things.  What are they going to do?  Little things.  I did a stat one time and they said how long it would take them if they were unchecked  to multiply and overtake the planet.  Who checks the aphids?  Ah, they're eaten by the bugs.  How are they?  And they're also in the census they were just caught lying.  But-  But when it gets to a point where we're all about just killing them constantly?  No, but I mean that would be-  They're not unchecked then.  But I mean if they were left just to reproduce.  Oh, but they're-  Okay, yeah, but they're not going to be unchecked.  It wasn't that long.  Anything left unchecked.  There would be fucking tigers running all over the place if it was unchecked. 
[01:52:30]  No, no, but I mean they-  How long would take them to weigh as much as the planet?  What?  Yeah, I think-  No way!  Do they serve a purpose?  A lot of aphids.  Here's an interesting stat.  You want to talk about numbers?  How long Iraq would take to weigh as much as the planet?  No, how long ago he started to.  Oh, shit.  Somebody's going to pop lock.  Do you know the game chess?  There are more chess possibilities.  More chess move possibilities.  Yeah.  Than there are known molecules in the universe. 
[01:53:00]  No, there aren't.  Wait, what?  No, there aren't.  There are more-  What happened?  Possibilities on a chess board.  Like playing a game of chess.  I will bet you-  Than there are known molecules in the universe.  I think that's impossible.  $100 right now that that is absolutely false.  Look up that stat.  I think that's impossible.  I will take the bet.  Alright.  $100?  Yes.  $100 that that is absolutely false.  I was blown away by it.  See, a 13-year-old wouldn't be discussing this.  Surely would. 
[01:53:30]  Sorry.  This is exactly what 13-year-olds talk about.  Sorry.  Are there more moves in chess or molecules in the universe?  I'll bet you $100.  Believe-  That's exactly what 13-year-olds do.  I bet there are more stars.  Yeah.  I bet there's more stars in the universe than possible chess moves.  Nope.  Possible chess moves.  Never mind molecules in the chess game.  How about grains of sand?  But that's molecules.  Do you know how many molecules go into a grain of sand?  A grain of sand.  Yeah.  So then there's no way Jimmy's right.  Dude, it can't be.  I'm just going with grains of sand.  Can't be.  Alright.  Wait a second. 
[01:54:00]  I think that's impossible.  I know.  Where'd you see this?  I read it, but it makes sense.  What placemat?  I'm all about the placemats.  Oh, that's true.  Was this on a placemat?  I read it on chessuniversecomparisons.com.  I guess a 13-year-old would get this from a placemat, so.  Very good.  What animal would take over Manhattan first?  If we had a super storm and we couldn't get the car away.  You really want my answer, or do you want to keep your job?  What animal?  What animal's close?  The squirrel?  The pigeon?  Well, I'm talking about shit we don't see. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, that kind of creeps down?  Yeah.  What would creep down first?  Maybe from upstate.  You've got to get something from upstate.  The lonely little coyote, perhaps.  There's no coyotes up there.  Oh, there are.  They occasionally come down here and they chase them around.  Nah, I've never seen a coyote.  Yes, they do.  What about a mountain lion?  I would say the deer.  Deer unchecked are fucking like locust.  Like locust!  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, Jimmy, since the universe is unending...  The known universe. 
[01:55:00]  I mean, they said the known universe.  What happens after that?  It becomes the unknown universe.  It doesn't count.  And how big is that?  They said then that's when the molecules really take off in the universe's favor.  That's why humans stink.  Just Google more molecules in the universe for moves out of the chest.  Because we can't grasp the fact that the universe is just endless.  That's why we stink.  You can't do it that way, saying known universe more than that, because that is already a biased fucking thing.  It's just confirming what you said, which might not be true.  I'm reading that they're talking about in the observable universe. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, the observable.  Okay.  Observable.  What happened?  That's crazy.  Would that really have changed your...  First of all, I don't even believe that.  Wait, Jimmy's right?  Jimmy's right?  There's an amazing amount of chess moves.  Yeah.  Especially after like the 10th position.  It's already ridiculous.  I want more information on this.  What are knots and crosses?  I don't know.  What's that mean?  I don't know.  Somebody's saying there's 26,000 plausible games of knots and crosses.  Oh, it must be 24,000.  If it's a smart player, you'll only see 10 or 20. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, I don't know.  I think this all includes like random moves just to keep the game going.  Yeah, of course.  Of course it does.  Do you want the number?  Oh, wait.  There's a total...  You owe him $100.  At the beginning of the game, the white ones choose one between 20 possible moves.  Next, the black ones have 20 options of answer.  So in a chess game, after the first movement, it can arise 400 different positions.  After two moves, it grows up to about 20,000.  After a few moves, the figure is enormous.  The actual number of moves is 10 to the 120th power, which looks like that. 
[01:56:30]  I can't even pronounce that.  I don't know what that number is.  It's just too many zeros.  There's too many zeros.  That's how big my pack is.  You owe him $100.  I don't think so.  I want to know how much, how many fucking molecules are in before I've...  We got that number.  Okay, we got that number.  I want the number of molecules in the observable universe.  It's over Google.  That's actually the number.  I like Google.  Google it.  Google's my friend.  Google it. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, it's just multiplication.  That's all.  There's so many possible moves.  Someone's saying you're confusing elements and molecules.  What?  Do you know how many molecules are in a sun that is the size of fucking like...  Sure.  Depends on how old he is.  Take a fucking, one of those fucking red giant suns.  Sure.  How many fucking molecules are in that?  700.  There's more chest moves.  I think I'm going to round it up to a thousand molecules.  I don't...  I just can't believe that. 
[01:57:30]  I know.  It's hard to comprehend.  I can't fucking believe that.  All right.  Fair enough.  It's almost like this.  Checkers stink.  Checkers stink.  If you started with a penny...  Do you like checkers?  Checkers.  I'm sorry.  If you started with a penny and you doubled it...  I think you're a good game of Othello.  Oy!  I would be in paradise.  Crazy.  Because I enjoy...  I like pennies.  No.  If you had a penny and you doubled it every day, you'd have a million dollars by the end  of the month.  Which now we've all got... 
[01:58:00]  I've gone through that.  It's true.  Yeah.  But it sounds like, what?  Two cents by day two.  Four cents by day three.  Eight cents.  Why don't we do it by day four?  So we're not supposed to talk about our contract.  Yeah.  So why don't we do this?  What do you mean?  Let's do this.  Do you want to...  We'll all come in with pennies and double it each day?  Yeah.  Let's see how far we can get.  It's a million dollars by the end of the month.  How about Opie brings in the pennies toward the end of this?  That hurts.  Well, I could too, but I don't want to make myself sound rich. 
[01:58:30]  Believe me, after January, I'm going to be a lot less rich if this fucking guy gets  in office again.  You've got to believe in your boy Romney there.  You've got to believe.  No, I've got to believe in my accountant that he can fucking do some stuff.  I don't have a guy.  Do you know, if anybody...  Let me say, everybody criticizes people for putting money offshore and the fact that  Apple paid 2% on income that they made off of foreign sales because they used the tax  loopholes to not pay the 50% they'd have to pay here in the States. 
[01:59:00]  If anybody that criticizes that had money and fucking put it in the bank and realize how  much they take in taxes, you'd put it offshore in a second.  Well, that's why those guys are assholes because everyone does it.  Everyone tries to figure out how, you know, how to save as much money as possible and get  around some shit.  Yeah.  Right?  Yeah.  Everyone does it.  Uh-huh.  I don't have a guy in this race, to be honest with you, but me and I were discussing it.  Well, Romney. 
[01:59:30]  Huh?  Oh, you said you don't have a guy in this race.  I was just saying that you're white.  Ah, yeah.  But I mean, me and I were discussing this on the way to the bathroom and Romney would  be way better for me.  I know that.  But I just don't have a guy in this race.  I know I'll have enough money in the end.  Yes, it's not about enough money.  See how you've given up?  It's not about enough money.  It's about the money you fucking earned.  And it's not no one else is entitled to take it and give it to someone else. 
[02:00:00]  It doesn't fucking happen.  If they want to use my tax money to better the infrastructure so that my life is a little  easier and other people's, I understand that, but that's the government's job.  Not to take my money because scum fucking leech cunt wants to fucking not work and pay  for her eight fucking kids.  That I have a problem with.  It would be a lot easier to pay my taxes if they allowed me a list of people I could  give that money to.  There you go.  That would be amazing.  That's it. 
[02:00:30]  That's it.  Life would be great.  Like, okay, I obviously have to give up all this money.  All right, what?  I have to pick a hundred people that this money goes to.  How great would that be?  Oh, man.  It would be really great.  By the way, speaking of taking money from one and giving it to the other, somebody is  going to take a hundred dollars and give it to old flabbitits.  What do you got?  What do you got?  You lost it.  Yahoo Answers.  I want to know how.  Yahoo Answers.  Oh, they're always right.  They're always right.  All right.  The question is, are there more moves on a chessboard than particles in the universe? 
[02:01:00]  Particles?  You said molecules.  You said molecules.  You said molecules.  With that, I...  Okay, then you don't owe me a hundred bucks, but the particles...  What's particle?  Wait, Jimmy's kidding.  You did say molecules.  Yes, there is a...  Because molecules, there's a fuckload of molecules in everything.  Well, a particle...  You know how many molecules are in this water, Opie?  Ooh, none.  It's invisible.  This crazy, invisible water?  That's right.  Fuckin' molecules up the ass.  No, what are...  All right.  Oh, no.  The number of particles in the universe is estimated at 10 to the 87th power. 
[02:01:30]  Mm-hmm.  While the number of chess, possible different chess games...  Wait, while the number of possible different chess games is estimated at 10 to the power  of...  10 to the power of 50.  So there are more possible chess games than particles.  That's games.  Okay.  Particle man.  There are approximately...  Yeah, we're 13.  Hey, you're rethinking that?  Yeah, I think we're 13.  There are approximately 10 to the 40th power possible chess games of less than 40 moves 
[02:02:00]  per side.  The question is properly the number of chess games, not moves, since it is theoretically  possible for moves to go on forever by repeating...  Theoretically, right.  Only a draw.  You can just keep going back and forth with the same piece.  So even though I said particles are not molecules, I didn't say games, I said moves.  You could just go doink, doink, one back, you could go back and forth forever and ever  with the same piece.  But no, you can't.  Because if you repeat the move three times in a row, it's a draw. 
[02:02:30]  Well, then you could do that, and then you could go the other way...  I'm just saying.  ...and repeat that, the other way and repeat that, and then do the first move again anyway.  Who would be stupid enough to do the same move three times in a row for a draw?  When you're in a bad spot.  That's a great thing.  If I'm in a spot where I know I'm about to get mated or I'm fucked...  Right.  All of a sudden, like say you have a...  Well, then that's not fair.  ...a queen on a diagonal, and you can just keep checking, check, and he has one square  to move, then you come back and check, one square to move.  You could do that forever and ever, and you have to announce, I'm never going to not make  this move.  After three times, it's a draw.  It's a great way to end a chess game. 
[02:03:00]  But you were going to lose that game.  Crazy.  Yes.  There's also a stalemate.  Why do they have that rule?  If obviously the other guy has the upper hand.  It happened to my bread the other day.  What?  What?  Stalemate.  I thought you were going to say you checkmated your bread. 
[02:03:30]  I'm like, what are they putting this pecker in our buns?  I don't know.  Jesus.  Wow.  Chipper.  Yeah.  Why do they have that rule?  Probably because you could delay...  If you're playing in a tournament or whatever, and you don't want to lose, and you're about  to lose, and you can do that, you would do that forever.  Why would you ever not do that?  Why would the game allow that if the other guy obviously has the upper hand, where you have  an out where you could get to a draw?  Because he should stop you from being able to do that.  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  A grandmaster would never let you get away with that.  He would see that he was going to put you in a fucking...  Well, there's the answer.  A possible perpetual check or whatever.  Yes.  Gotcha.  There's the answer.  I didn't understand.  I don't get chess.  I know.  I mean, I used to like playing it as a kid, but I didn't know anything about it, really.  I heard Josh Waitzkin hangs out at the cellar, the guy who was searching for Bobby  Fisher.  It was about him.  I would love to meet him.  Yeah?  I love it.  I don't know who he looks like, Tim.  I don't know who he looks like, Tim.  I don't know who he looks like, Tim.  I don't know who he looks like, Tim.  I want to make it a big announcement. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  Every night.  Are you here?  I should just stand up and yell, checkmate!  And see who looks...  Gets all excited.  94!  See who looks up from there?  Yeah.  See who...  Yeah.  See who drops...  I want to see who drops that thing like in that...  Like the finger of God.  Checkmate!  Oh, no.  There's a master's champion in here.  Master's champion.  Master's champion.  You want more entree?  Yes.  Oh, wow.  We're still on the audio contest.  Audio contest.  This is Ron. 
[02:05:00]  I can't pronounce your last name.  Sorry.  Abulafia.  Abul...  Oh, boy.  Abulafia.  Something like that.  You know what Sal's production piece should have been?  What?  I'm a popete-haired cunt.  Popete-haired cunt.  I'm a popete-haired cunt.  See, I've learned not to laugh over things like that, so they'll be isolated well for later. 
[02:05:30]  I like it.  It's short.  It's pertinent.  A popete-haired cunt.  I like it.  Next entry is Jeff Hansen.  I enjoyed the concept of this.  Oh, fuck.  Defending yourself again.  It sucks.  Before it happened.  No, it's different.  Weird.  I was right on water, wasn't I?  You think Ed Schultz is excited about the election today?  Oh, God.  See, here's why I want Romney to win. 
[02:06:00]  And it became very radical, and it gave the Obama team an opportunity to really focus in.  Okay, this is what Romney wants.  This is what he believes in.  So those three stories, I think, were unanticipated hurdles that the Romney team had.  Oh, God, of course.  You know what?  I want, I really want Obama to win, not just because I think it would be much better for  the country and me personally, but the Obama supporters are so certain of his victory.  The Romney supporters, we have our reservation. 
[02:06:30]  We're thinking like, eh, it's, you know, it definitely tips in Obama's favor right now.  We have hope that he could pull it out, but we're hoping for the best.  They absolutely believe Obama's going to win.  If it doesn't work out for them, they will lose their fucking minds.  Of course.  I don't really want to see that.  I will sit here.  I'll be mad.  I'll come in tomorrow and you'll hear me rant, but I kind of expect it, you know?  I want the unexpected horror of them not having President Obama in office anymore. 
[02:07:00]  Well, they're broadcasting from Democracy Plaza.  Democracy Plaza?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Oh, now they're talking about Florida.  There's Indiana and Missouri, two states they should have won going away.  All right.  Fuck it.  Here's Jeff Hansen and his entry into the audio contest.  Some 18 years ago, I left Dayton, Ohio.  Dayton, Ohio. 
[02:07:30]  Dayton, Ohio.  Oh, baby.  You.  Sit down.  To bed knees.  But you say he's just a friend.  I'm just a loud girl.  And this is true.  Girl, you know it's true.  I don't get this.  Oh.  Truth.  Truth.  Truth.  I love you.  Alright, that's kind of funny.  Yes, you know it's true.  Truth.  Oh.  I don't get this.  Truth.  Truth.  Truth.  Truth. 
[02:08:00]  I love you.  Alright, that's kind of funny.  Yes, you know it's truth.  That's funny.  I thank God that the dream came true.  Thank you, man.  All right.  Well, I like the concept.  Well, you know it's true.  I actually like that song by Milli Fanelli.  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy. 
[02:08:30]  I like that.  You like it, too?  It's not a bad song, to be honest with you.  Because I love...  No, no, no, no.  I can't take that.  I wish I could.  Life would open up.  I got a shit.  I got a shit.  Yeah, I got to make a doo-doo.  You know how awful it is when you ask a fucking massage therapist who's fingering your asshole  to check her fingers?  And she says yes to it.  There was a little fecal matter on them.  A little fecal?  Oh, really?  Yeah, let's pretend I'm not improv-ing that.  I like this song.  Because I love you. 
[02:09:00]  That was a big song.  Who sings that?  Who sings that?  I know.  I forget it.  Stevie B.  What?  This was big when I was, like, drinking back in high school.  Stevie B?  You all right?  I don't know.  You don't remember this one?  I used to love this song.  It's how long ago it was.  He said, I'll open a letter from the postman.  You don't remember this from fucking, like, the 80s? 
[02:09:30]  I haven't heard it yet.  Oh, okay.  That's a good point.  The first chord.  You sang it hard.  I don't know this.  Right.  What's this intro?  It's not long enough.  I like the Danny sneeze over the intro.  That's pretty good.  Wow, another guy trying to do Michael Jackson, huh? 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  A lot of minor chords in this fucking thing.  It's supposed to be sad.  I don't think I know this.  I'm waiting for it to kick in.  Just simple lines intertwining lines.  It's called Lick My Love Pump.  It sounds like another song, by the way. 
[02:10:30]  It sounds like a Chicago song or something.  Maybe.  I don't know it.  Wow.  I really don't know it.  What year did this come out?  Can you check?  I love you.  I'll be right by your side.  It's a smaltzy love song, but I just like it.  I just don't know it.  Yeah.  Stevie B.  He even says his own name in the song.  I know.  Did he have a follow-up hit? 
[02:11:00]  I don't know.  This must have been the only one he had.  It's so close.  It sounds like another song.  Yeah, it's so close.  It sounds like another song.  Just let me reassure you.  This is where he says his name.  It's not my favorite part.  Oh no, later he goes, that Stevie B. will always be around.  Not my favorite part.  This is 1990.  It's not because Stevie C. will always be around. 
[02:11:30]  Boo!  Sorry.  1990.  I was actually sober.  Yeah.  What happened to this guy?  Let's find out what happened to Stevie B.  You had this big hit in 1990.  Yes.  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo!  Why do they cancel Halloween?  Yes.  Do you guys really want to know what happened to Stevie B?  I don't know.  Oh no, I want to Stevie B.  There he's laughing.  Do you want to know what happened to Stevie B?  Well, on September 30th, 2011, Hill was arrested by Springfield, Massachusetts police officers 
[02:12:00]  during one of his concerts due to him owing $420,000 in unpaid child support.  Oh wow.  Stevie B.  And what's the name of the song again?  Because I Love You.  Apparently not singing to his kid.  Yeah, no kidding.  That Stevie B. will always be around.  Because I'm a dead, be dead, that I don't really care. 
[02:12:30]  We're going to play the whole thing.  Yeah, we have to.  Yeah?  I don't think we do.  You know what?  He's actually had a lot of singles besides this.  No, he hasn't.  I swear.  Uh-oh.  Wait.  He's charted through the 90s.  Eli, that's where he says his name.  I'll step on your fingers.  Oh.  Wait.  Oh no, it's not.  I think he said it.  I think he said it because I just heard B.  It was a fade out.  When E-Rock came back, I heard B.  It might be here.  No, it's at the end. 
[02:13:00]  He's trying to lock through.  Isn't this the end?  No.  There's more verses to this than there are potential chest moves.  Oh.  Get it.  What the fuck?  Do you think his 2009 single was successful?  I hate to hear that.  Do you want to hear his 2009 song?  I really don't.  Eric, do you have It Ain't Over?  Yeah, let's do it.  19 years later.  That was him singing to his business manager. 
[02:13:30]  I really don't know that song.  Yeah, it was a very big song.  2008.  At Sober Dances, I would go to.  Do you have Running for Miles?  Would you get laid at Sober Dances?  I didn't do well at them.  I have nothing this decade.  I would slow dance with a girl to that song.  It's so good.  I was like 22, 23.  Ew, you slow danced?  I don't mean mentally.  Yeah, I was slow dancing.  I would go out and go.  Hey, you gang, you gang, you gang, you gang, you gang, you gang, you gang. 
[02:14:00]  You weren't into slow dancing?  No, it was like sex when you were growing up.  That was the time to make out.  You would make out.  You'd grab a little handful of ass.  I'm a good slow dancer.  That's great.  Yeah.  Are you?  Can you demonstrate?  I don't.  Who do you want to demonstrate with?  I don't do it too much.  Jimmy's going in.  Jimmy's dancing.  But I don't step on toes.  No.  I don't dance like stylously.  Step on toes.  I don't step on toes.  And I get my fucking, I position my dick so it's pointing straight up. 
[02:14:30]  And I press right into the veg crack.  Attaboy.  Attaboy.  Right when a baby comes out.  You want some more entries in the audio concert?  Yes, this one's from Stevie B.  This is Stevie B, but just not the newer Stevie B.  There is more Stevie B, but it's just none of his obvious stuff.  But is it anything we really know?  I don't.  Richard Marks.  Did we really know that?  It.  Richard Marks.  Yeah.  Richard Marks.  Is that the song it sounds like?  Give me the Richard Marks hit. 
[02:15:00]  That's it though.  No?  Oh, I got it right here.  The Richard Marks song.  Here we go.  Oh, good.  Ah!  Come to us and you'll drive away.  There's no better way to say it.  It rocks.  Tell us about it, Manfredi.  Where's that hot little girl?  Come by and see us today at the Manfredi Auto Group.  Where is it?  Oh!  What do I do when I'm ready?  When you're ready, go to be a friend. 
[02:15:30]  Oh!  Aw!  Ugly little bitch.  I hate that kid.  Ah, you're a really mean guy.  A part of your body was Stevie's biggest hit.  Let's hear a part of your body.  Oh, we are the dinosaurs marching, marching.  We are the dinosaurs.  What do you think of that?  We are the dinosaurs marching, marching.  We are the dinosaurs.  We make the earth flat. 
[02:16:00]  We make the earth flat.  Oh, God.  This is it.  Woo!  Party Your Body by Stevie B.  This is the closing credits fucking song from every 80s movie.  Yes!  Party Your Body.  Yeah, you're walking out of the theater.  That was pretty good.  Did you like it?  It was funny.  Oh, my God. 
[02:16:30]  It is, dude.  Yeah.  This is terrible.  It would be like the...  It would be a club breakdance movie, yes.  Or sometimes, like, if it was like a somber drama, like, they'd have that real stringy music  through half the credits, but then, like, there was that point where it would stop, and then  they had to start a new credits song.  Yes!  And it was always much more tempo.  Long credits.  I don't know this.  I don't either.  They found the new one, too.  The 1990 one.  Oh, yeah.  You got it?  I might have to go down below 13 at this point. 
[02:17:00]  12.  Oh, wow.  Wow, wow, wow.  Oh, that's stupid horn.  Every time.  It makes me laugh.  Every time.  It's terrible.  Holy God, do I love this.  This is goofy music. 
[02:17:30]  This is some goofy music.  But it gets so stuck in your head.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That's funny.  Just because it starts...  Womp, womp, womp, womp.  Christ, I got to sit through this now.  Womp, bam.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Let's go back to the audio contest.  More entries.  All right.  This is Rocco Burrow. 
[02:18:00]  Hey.  Remember, $2,000 courtesy of IHateStevenSinger.com.  Entries need to be in by Friday.  Noon.  Noon Friday.  All right.  E-Rock is fat.  Oh, she's fat.  A barter shop quartet.  So fucking fat.  So fucking fat.  Hey, E-Rock, if you're awake, 
[02:18:30]  take us to break.  Take us to break.  Nice.  That was pretty good.  I like that.  Very harmonic.  Mm-hmm.  Very good.  A little skating on fucking democracy.  Do you see?  No.  We'll try that for you. 
[02:19:00]  Skating poorly.  Hey, stick around in morning.  I hope he smashes his face  and turns a state into a red state with his blood.  We're actually going to use flames.  That'd be great.  That would help you.  On that.  So stick around with Brian Sullivan,  who's going to light his hair.  Shut up.  That is terrible.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, it's just awful.  Nothing intelligent happens to this music. 
[02:19:30]  It's like, they're not showing, like, NASA engineers working on stuff.  No, he's dancing with a plunger in the opening credits.  Volpe?  That'd be funny, too.  Yeah, it's a club dance called Do the Little Weema.  After each one won't be here and ouch.  We're fucking old.  Yeah, you don't see, like, Boeing fucking footage  of them building a 757.  This is a great song to bounce a ball to. 
[02:20:00]  Ah, shit.  La, la, la, la, la.  Da, da, da, da, da.  Ah.  Right.  I get it.  It's terrible.  Jimmy goes, I know.  It's terrible.  Ah.  Ah, let's do Ari Lewin.

[02:21:00]  Is that because if your feet want to play the horn or something?  Uh-oh, the next one is labeled good concept.  Yeah.  I thought this was good enough to be played.  It's a Hitler speech.  I like what he was doing here.  All right.  But it's not great.  Evan Lambert. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, good.  This guy's probably taste good with mint jelly.  A little creep.  I'm a creep.  Shut up.  You don't like that?  When you was only four.  All right.  All right.  I wondered where he was going with that.  I like what he was doing here.  What's it supposed to be?  Creep by radio.  What's the line supposed to be?  Oh, where were you before? 
[02:22:00]  Oh, when you was, okay.  When you was only four.  You could look me in the eye.  I said you look like an angel.  My whiskey breath made you cry.  You float like a diaper.  You're thrown out the side of your crib. 
[02:22:30]  Did I tell you you were special?  I'll give you something special.  I'm not a creep.  My niece goes to this daycare.  Looks like all your little friends are here.  You say, Uncle Paul, that don't belong there. 
[02:23:00]  Turkey foot don't belong there.  Damn, fucking good.  Yeah, I like that.  He has a voice like an angel.  Oh, you like it?  Sure.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  What a beautiful singing voice.  It was.  We got talented listeners.  Except for the last guy.  You put this on here because it's an example of not good.  Not good.  Buddhist.  For all I know you guys think this is a star.  Come on.  We can't until we hear it.  Buddhist.  Buddhist.  They're just three dudes on the radio 
[02:23:30]  And he rocks slow  Sandals blow  They'll bang you raw dog  In the butt hole  And you should go  You should go  To get yourself tested for some  Herbogonics to believe  They, they, they, they, they, they, they, they  Broken condom style  Condom style

[02:25:00]  Morning mashup plays mashup style  No, they don't  Can I hear that?  I don't, I'm trying to get access to their folder  But they replaced the hook  Sam's right down the hall  If the song plays  But it says morning mashup style  Sam's right down the hall  Sam loves fucking getting involved in other people's shit  Look at them  Look at those three pound Doc Martens  So you know he's got something good  I know, big calf muscles  You got morning mashup style?  No, I was going to help you rock find it  Oh, you know where it is?  Well, they, I mean, that's all they play on their show 
[02:25:30]  Like that, they literally  It's not like a parody  Like they took the song  Oh no  And that's the version of the song they play  Yeah  He doesn't say  Gangnam style  He says mashup style  Ah, let's get that  Yeah, he did it  I'm like, wait, how did he do it?  He was in here  And he did it?  Oh, he actually did it  When was he here?  Of course he did it  What else is he going to do?  When the song was  He has one massive hit  Yeah, when the song was like first getting popular  He's not going to have a follow-up  No  Isn't he a big star in Korea anyway though?  Big star  Yeah, I think he has a name there 
[02:26:00]  Big star in Korea  He definitely has a name  Heavy big  But that's the best part of the song  And he wrecks it by doing morning mashup style  That's what he says  I would play that if I was that too though  I would  But it is him singing it  So let's find it  You know where it is?  Yes  You have to put up after mash  Just play it from the beginning  You know how many of those  He's probably done for all those hit radio shows  Of course  Across the country  Oh, that's true  I would love  I'll be Anthony style  Shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck

Oh, I don't know  That's the one I remember  Oh, I don't know  We built this city  I always had the local traffic for your area  Oh, no  That song's locked in their folder 
[02:27:00]  I can't get access to it  Maybe Sam can ask them  Oh, by the way  I'm so glad I got my flu shot  Because I feel like shit now  I feel like shit  Can you get it?  What the fuck's up with flu shots?  And I asked the lady  I go, will this make me sick?  Because I've heard  Like sometimes you get the flu shot  It makes you sick for a couple days  But not as bad as actually getting the flu  She goes, it shouldn't  Well, I'm here to say it did  Well, don't they like inject the flu in you?  Yes  Yeah  Aren't you not supposed to even get them?  Aren't they for like the fucking infirmed and elderly? 
[02:27:30]  Or if you have fucking two small kids in home  Oh, okay  They bring home every fucking virus there is  Oh  Cyrus the virus?  They highly recommend that fucking parents get the flu shot  That'd be deadly  Why do I feel  I'd be getting sicker as the show goes on here  I got a flu shot to prevent this  You don't get flu shots?  No  I just get the flu  I don't want to get the flu this year  You don't really get the flu?  No  I got one last year with that cough I had and everything 
[02:28:00]  Oh, yeah  But, you know  I think you just got to take those  You got to take it  And let your body build up those antibodies  Well, that's what I did  By having it injected into me  I know  I like the natural way, though, you know  Jimmy, you got the flu shot?  I did, yeah, weeks ago  Did it make you feel weird?  A couple days later?  No, I asked the same thing  And she gave me the same answer  And I know I felt okay  Or maybe I just need a good night's sleep  I'm hoping  I would wake up with headaches  That's how bad my acne is  I just feel like a fucking shower  Oh, really? Headaches?  Headaches  I do, too, but it's called a hangover 
[02:28:30]  You still get hangovers?  Yeah  Not bad unless I'm fucking pounding on the weekend  But even a couple of beers  That are, you know, put in there a little too late  That will give you a little bit of a head thumper  Well, I have nothing else on flu shots  That was wasting time until the rock found the song  Yeah, he's got it  But he can't get it out of the folder  It's locked  I really don't have much on flu shots  Bum, ba, bum, ba, mashup style  Bum, ba, bum, ba, bum, pa, dam, kry  Api style

That was very nice, Tim.  Thank you. 
[02:29:30]  50 hours and 20 discs of UFC fights.  I'm going to watch them all in a row.  Nice.  Okay, and the hands goes like this.  He's teaching the morning mashup how to do the dance.  And make a bounce like you're riding a horse.  Oh, he speaks English very well.  I would do that.  He reminds me of that guy from Mesh.  Everyone that isn't a regular on the show.  One, two, three, four.  It's that easy.  One, two, three, four. 
[02:30:00]  Oh, no.  Oh, look at the cameras going off like it's a big event.  There were so many people there.  Like, really?  Yeah.  Thank you.  We should do that.  I would do the dance with him.  Yeah, why the fuck didn't he teach us to dance?  You guys hadn't figured out the song yet.  We're a big fucking deal around here.  Yeah, look at them doing the dance.  Stop doing the dance.  Are you embarrassed for this?  Yes.  Stop doing the dance.  Would you have stayed late to learn the dance?  Yeah, I would have.  Well, no. 
[02:30:30]  That's a viral hit for Sirius.  Whoop, whoop.  Yeah, 24,000 views.  Oh, yeah.  That's their biggest video, I bet.  Huge.  God, they have no idea how fucking the internet works yet.

[02:31:00]  Yeah, it is.  I need some Manfredi douche or the dinosaur douche or something.  I need vitamin C.  Really?  I need some vitamin C.  How do we get some vitamin C?  Honestly, do you know where vitamin C comes from?  It's fucking...  It's all made in a stupid factory in Addison, Texas.  Really?  Well, I will be November 15th, 16th, and 17th at the Improv.  Giving out vitamin C gifts.  Oh, Jimmy's Segway plugs.  Whoop.  Whoop.  They're great.  Yeah.  Whoop, whoop, whoop.

You should be ready in, like, within a minute.  What?  Within a minute?  All right.  In a minute?  Or in a minute?  It's Sam Roberts time!  Come on, Sammy!  Where'd you get them docks?  Joey.  What are you fucking skinheads?  They look very heavy.  They're not heavy.  They're surprisingly light.  They have bouncing soles.  You know where those should be?  Whoa, so does Travis. 
[02:32:00]  They shouldn't be on your feet.  They should be on your fucking face, smashing your head in.  Why would you say that?  Yeah, they're good for stomping queens.  Are they comfortable?  Yes.  Yeah, they are.  They're more comfortable than they were.  They're a lot lighter.  Yeah.  I mean, you asked a question.  You're supposed to put white laces in there, Sam.  No, that means something.  Red laces, even better.  What does white laces mean?  White power!  White power.  What's red laces mean?  Red laces mean you fucking used them for doing some fucking damage to some faces.  Oh, I thought red laces might have meant something like the Red Shoe Diaries of your favorite 
[02:32:30]  program.  All right, we are a go on the morning action.  Where'd we go?  You want to hear this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Start from the beginning, because we like the song in general.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  What a mess of you.  Morning Mesh-Up style.  Oh.  Mesh-Up style.  I'm embarrassed.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh. 
[02:33:00]  Are we singing about Nicole right here?  Yeah.  This is what Nicole is.  This is what she sounds like talking after she's out of the bar.  See?  Because she can't speak.  She's drunk.  Yeah.  Sounds like an easy language.  Yeah, you just go, better go like that.  Yeah.  We'll hear the hook one more time.  Yeah.  God damn it, learner.  Hey. 
[02:33:30]  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Morning mash-up style.  Oh, is that food?  No.  Wow.  It doesn't even go.  No.  They didn't even mix it right. 
[02:34:00]  Oh, God.  That's terrible.  Are they embarrassed, Sam?  No.  All right.  Nicole didn't want us to play it.  And Stan.  Stan was like, no, no, no.  Let him play it.  Let him play it.  And then, like, wait till they hear.  This.  All right.  Turn it up again.  I'm going to play it.  Yeah.  Oh, that's terrible.  Is it bad?  Oh, it's so embarrassing.  All right.  Turn it up, man.  Little body.  Little body. 
[02:34:30]  What?  What? 
[02:35:00]  Morning Mesh-Up Star.  Stop it.  Stop it.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Stop whining.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Stop it.  Mesh-Up Star.  Stop it.  Is this the version they play instead of a...  Morning Mesh-Up Star.  Son of a bitch.  All right, you know.  What are you going to do?  Why didn't Nicole want us to play it? 
[02:35:30]  Yeah, what happened?  She's embarrassed by it.  She knew we would make fun of it.  Oh, how did she know?  Because we're jealous, Sam.  Is that it?  That's right.  Open out of the style.  Morning Mesh-Up Star.  Morning Mesh-Up Star.  You guys don't have a version.  That's why we're making fun.  Morning Mesh-Up Star.  We're just jealous.  At the end of the day.  At the end of the day, we're just jealous.  At the end of the day.  What the hell does that mean?  Rich said it's lame, but I also think that he says that their stuff is lame when I'm around. 
[02:36:00]  Yeah.  And he just loves it when you're not.  He's like Gervais when he's trying to show off the picture of him on the cover of the magazine.  He goes, oh, yeah, I was just going to throw this out.  And he goes, what place isn't on the garbage?  Ricky Gervais is coming in today, by the way.  Yes, he is.  Oh, my God.  And unfortunately, it's going to be a Jim Norton, Sam Roberts production.  What's unfortunate about that?  I fucking love Gervais, but I have to fucking get home.  Why?  I have to get home. 
[02:36:30]  Why?  I got people coming over.  Who's coming over?  People.  Voters?  Delivering things.  Delivering things.  Could be for my benefit as far as energy goes.  Let's just put it that way.  Well, Jim and I have someone coming over, too.  His name is Ricky Gervais.  I got, let's see, where's my text?  Are you voting?  Well, I'm going to vote, but I could do that any time.  Are you voting for electricity?  I vote for Ben Franklin. 
[02:37:00]  That's it.  Gangnam style.  Morning mashup style.  Morning mashup style.  Let's hear morning mashup style.  The first part.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I would stay.  That's okay.  I'll listen.  No, no.  Morning mashup style.  We're going to go break.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  No, I actually, I love it. 
[02:37:30]  Is it good?  Yeah, I think it's good.  Let's hear it one more time.  Morning mashup style.  Blackfeel looks good.  Yeah. 
[02:38:00]  Bye-bye.  Love you.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  I love Johns. 
[02:38:30]  This is the Opie Anthony Show on Sirius XM.  Welcome to Should I Suck a Dick or Not?  The show where nationally known comedians meet our panel and try to decide, should I suck a dick or not? 
[02:39:00]  Today's guest, Joe DeRosa.  I do a bit about this, about the stair step up to it.  It's not as easy as would you just swallow the cum.  There are many levels of things you need to get through first.  I might be fucking all in.  I might want to go all the way.  Now, what would you do with the dick?  That's the thing I don't know.  That's what he hasn't really answered.  I wouldn't be into swallowing any jizz.  No, you have to.  That's the thing.  Why are you making these rules?  Quarantine rules.  It makes it more interesting.  Quarantine rules.  I've had my own jizz on my face. 
[02:39:30]  What's the difference?  It's another man's.  Wow.  It looks like Joe DeRosa is going to suck dick.  That's all the time we have this week.  Tune in next time when Ricky Gervais tries to decide.  That's not only a dick.  That's the biggest dick in the world.  Should I suck a dick or not?  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:40:00]  Do, do, do, do, do.  Election Day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Get out there and vote.  So what, Chris Rock did a little something-something for Jimmy Kimmel?  People are talking about it.  Gee, I wonder if it's pro-Obama.  I would imagine so.  Oh, I would too.  Is that wrong?  Well, um.  For Chris Rock to do something for Obama? 
[02:40:30]  Is that okay with you?  It's totally.  Is that all right?  No surprise there.  There's some site for black executives, I guess it is.  A black executive fucking blog site or something.  And there was actually an article on there about how prejudiced it is that 90% of white people  are voting for Romney or something.  Or not voting for Romney.  Romney's voting base is 90% white. 
[02:41:00]  That's different than 90% of white people voting for Romney.  Romney's voting base is 90% white.  Yet, I think 99% of black people are voting for Obama, which is different.  That's not, that doesn't mean 90% of his voting base is black.  It means that 99% of black people are voting for Obama.  Gotcha.  They're voting based on race.  This is where black people have gone completely crazy.  It's like, you guys, black people refuse to see any racial, or admit any racial animosity 
[02:41:30]  or racially based, like, yeah, white people have it, but black people never seem to think  that they do shit that is kind of racially obsessive too.  Let me ask you a serious question, and you tell me if this isn't...  14.3% unemployment in the black community.  14.3% unemployment in the black community.  Yet, 99% of black people are voting for Obama.  Shouldn't they just, based off of that alone, maybe 5% shouldn't be there? 
[02:42:00]  Maybe it should be 94% of black people?  Well, Obama, what was it before Obama?  Unemployment?  The black community.  I think it's held steady at, between, anywhere between 13 and change and 15 and change.  It's, it's an insane number.  The poverty level for blacks has increased under Obama.  The, uh, welfare...  Why aren't you voting for them?  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:42:30]  It just seems to me that Obama is betting on the impoverished,  and Romney is betting on success.  It's just, it, his, his base, Obama's base are people that are, are taxing on the nation.  It's, it really is amazing.  But, but you would think that they would think with their heads and go like,  all right, this guy's been in four years, our, our, the black community has 14 and a half percent 
[02:43:00]  unemployment, maybe we ought to try something else out.  But no, because he's black, they will vote for a black guy.  No matter what.  No matter what.  No matter what he's not for.  It's ludicrous.  And then white people get accused of racism because they're not voting for him?  Fuck you.  Let's play the Chris Rock thing from Jimmy Kimmel.  Oh, please.  Oh, where is it?  There it is.  As you know, the presidential election is on Tuesday.  According to the polls, Obama and Romney are still neck and neck. 
[02:43:30]  Both campaigns made their like final push today.  Romney has a very strong lead among white voters,  but some prominent Obama supporters are looking to chip into that.  What's that?  Our friend Chris Rock is one of them.  Chris Rock is from Brooklyn, here in Brooklyn.  And tonight he's recorded a special message for us  targeted specifically at undecided voters of the Caucasian variety.  So listen and decide for yourself.  Everyone nervous who laughs?  This race is involved.  I am Chris Rock with a special message for white people.  In times like these, you need a white president you can trust. 
[02:44:00]  And that white president's name is Barack Obama.  Let's take a look at the facts.  For the first two thirds of his life, Barack Obama was known as Barry,  which is the third whitest name on earth.  Right at the podium, Jeff.  And these are the white people who raised Barry.  Madeline and Stanley Dunham.  They're so white they have to wear sunglasses  because they're hurting each other's eyes.  At the college, Barry went into black neighborhoods in Chicago 
[02:44:30]  to try to organize people.  How white is that?  Black people don't go into black communities.  We don't have to.  We're already there.  Look at it.  Playing golf.  Body surfing.  Wearing mom jeans.  Wearing Helen.  Barack Obama supports gay marriage.  Most black men don't even support straight marriage.  President Obama has a dog.  But is it a pit bull?  Is it a rottweiler? 
[02:45:00]  No.  It's a Portuguese water dog.  And he named him Bo after one of the Dukes of Hattie.  And let's not forget, Barack Obama is whiter than Snooki, the tanning mom, and Tara Reade.  Even Mitt Romney is blacker than Obama.  This is Obama's family.  And these are the Romney's kids, cousins, aunts, uncles.  Mitt Romney's family has more people in it than a Tyler Perry movie. 
[02:45:30]  And if you're still not convinced, check this out.  I, Barack Hussein Obama, do solemnly swear.  I am a white guy.  So help me God.  If you want a white president, I've got a polo-wearing, Hawaii-living, home-beer-brewing, league-bowling guy for you.  Barry Obama.  He's just white.  Fuck.  Chris Rock.  That's pretty fucking funny.  Hilarious.  That is pretty fucking funny. 
[02:46:00]  Hilarious.  You know what?  The best part of that whole thing, Obama really wears shitty jeans.  Mom jeans.  They're horrible jeans.  That's fucking funny, man.  Where the fuck does he get those from?  That's really funny.  Fuck, man.  Yep.  Yeah, you can tell why that got a couple of hits, I guess.  That's really funny.  That's it, though?  Wait a minute.  No.  What's blacks for Romney?  I'm sure it's not funny.  Well, there was one part that made me laugh yesterday.  We can go for it.  It's kind of like the same thing where, you know, he's trying to get you to black people 
[02:46:30]  to vote for Obama.  Obama, this is the other way.  Blacks for Romney.  Four years of a failed economy, unprecedented unemployment, and the same old politics in  Washington.  I'm a six.  It's clear now.  We just don't need a black president.  We need a real nigga.  We need Mitt Romney.  Jesus.  If we're going to heal this economy, we need a motherfucker that gets money.  I need a president to take pictures with money, because all the niggas I look up to take 
[02:47:00]  pictures with money.  You want to know why?  It's because they're real niggas.  Mitt Romney gets his shoes shined on a tarman.  This nigga creates jobs.  Yachts?  Cadillacs?  Bitches?  That's what I want from my president.  And nobody knows about getting bitches like Mormons, nigga.  And they say Mr. Romney isn't relatable.  But like him, I loves me a white bitch.  Nicki Minaj endorsed Mitt Romney. 
[02:47:30]  You don't think she will vote for a real nigga?  Ich bin Yiddish.  Und ich befürwarte diese nache.  So remember, when you go to the polls this November, vote for a real nigga.  Vote for Mitt Romney.  Blacks for Romney.  I'm Mitt Romney, and I approve this message.  That's funny.  That's funny.  That's all right.  Yeah.  It's all right.  See, black and white people can all get together and take pictures of themselves with money.  Right.  See?  And then everybody's open.  The phones are lit because of what you were saying there, Ansel.  Say hi to Jeff in Pennsylvania. 
[02:48:00]  Jeff?  I hate anybody with two Fs in their name.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, man.  Hey, Anthony, I don't understand.  All right.  You're criticizing black people for being with the president, okay?  But what has Mitt Romney done to actually, you know, try to get into that crowd?  And, I mean, why would they even want to support Mitt Romney?  Because it's something different than 14.5% unemployment, still rampant crime in even his 
[02:48:30]  home fucking city of Chicago.  Obama's done nothing to advance his people, the black community.  Yet they vote for him at a rate that far exceeds what they should vote just based on his record.  But why would they vote for Romney?  I don't understand.  Why would they even do that when Romney simply isn't catering from a policy standpoint?  He's not catering to them at all.  How do you know?  Obama is proven not catering to the black community. 
[02:49:00]  Romney and his policies, if they come to fruition about jobs, making jobs for this country, getting  people off the fucking government till and back to work, perhaps that's better for the  black community than just perpetuating this staying on welfare and unemployment and rampant  violence in the cities.  What has Obama done that makes 99% of the black people want to vote for him again?  No, but that's where I think you're wrong. 
[02:49:30]  I mean, you said that, you know, Obama's not catering to them.  According to GOP messaging, of course he is.  He's catering to them by being black.  He's catering to not the majority.  I understand blacks normally do vote Democratic.  What I'm saying is the amount of blacks voting for Obama far exceeds how many there should  be voting for Obama based on the record and the effect that Obama's presidency has had  on blacks. 
[02:50:00]  Actually, the lack of effect.  I get you.  But what I'm saying is that Mitt Romney, from a pure political and policy standpoint,  offered anything to that community.  Oh, really?  How about a business?  Your lives are going to be better under this.  How about a businessman that has created jobs in the past?  How about that?  Improving the country, getting unemployment down.  That's what he's saying he's going to do.  Whether he does it or not, I'm saying that's his platform. 
[02:50:30]  So why aren't they adhering to that and saying, all right, I would like a president that's  putting people back to work?  Because it's very apparent that when these guys are campaigning, okay, if you understand  policy, it's very job creation in an urban community is much different than, say, your  average ordinary suburban community.  Oh, is it?  It is.  All right.  And I would say the black community in urban environments aren't feeling that Mitt Romney  is reaching them with his policy.  So with four years of Obama in place, and obviously it hasn't worked, they'd rather go another four 
[02:51:00]  years with him than take a shot that perhaps Romney can help them.  I mean, that's another discussion, too.  No, it's not.  It's the exact discussion I'm having with you.  This is the point I'm making, is why would they vote for Obama when Obama's record over  four years has been to keep the black people at 14 and a half percent unemployment?  The president has issued a jobs plan. 
[02:51:30]  The House of Representatives won't vote on it.  Oh, stop.  Stop with that.  Holy shit.  And a lot of those...  The blame game that Obama has played between George W. Bush and Congress not allowing him  to do what he wanted to do.  He had two years of impunity that he could have done any fucking thing he wanted to do.  And he didn't.  So what happened?  Oh, oh, so great.  We spent it on health care.  How about fucking the economy and helping people get back to work? 
[02:52:00]  Stop it.  His social programs are breaking this fucking country and creating a new level of leeches  that have no ambition to get a job and don't have to because the wealth distribution that's  going on by just executing people that make money and make jobs in this country.  It's ridiculous.  There's leeches and then there's the people that they're sucking from.  And the people they're sucking from are the villains in this scenario. 
[02:52:30]  It's amazing what's become of this fucking country in almost four years with this guy  in charge.  Change it up!  Language!  Wow, that was crazy.  Thank you, Jeff.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  We got an independent voter on the phone.  Right.  James in Tampa.  It says, your aunt's worst nightmare.  Why?  I'm an independent voter in Florida and I just voted for Obama.  Why is that, sir?  Well, I'm an independent contractor, so I'm totally 1099. 
[02:53:00]  And the one worry I have is...  You rock on the phone.  You're talking about cutting different tax loopholes and this, that, and the other.  My whole...  You know, I write off so much.  Yeah.  If they lower my tax rate, but don't allow me to write off certain things, then I get  screwed.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Well, enjoy yourself on the first anyway, because you're going to have the same...  Actually, less write-offs than you have right now, yet your taxes will go up after January. 
[02:53:30]  They absolutely are going up.  So you're going to wind up paying more than you would have if Romney was able to bring  the tax rate down 20% across the board and close some tax loopholes.  Even though you do write off a lot, you would...  I absolutely believe in the fact that we would be paying less, or at least the same taxes.  I don't know.  But I think less.  I know damn well I make out a little better under Romney than I do Obama. 
[02:54:00]  It's going to be nice.  It's going to be nice after January not being able to deduct my fucking mortgage interest.  That's going to be beautiful.  It's going to be great that 50% fucking death tax on people that assets over a million dollars.  It sounds like a lot, I know.  But in a lifetime, if you've accumulated a million dollars of assets, I don't mean cash.  I mean everything you fucking own.  The government takes half after January 1st.  Half if you own more than a million dollars in assets. 
[02:54:30]  So you can't leave a lot behind for your family.  No, you're fucked.  Why can't you take off mortgage interest?  Mortgage interest?  Why?  Because we've got to pay for the leeches, Jimmy.  The leech has got to be paid for.  You pay fucking...  Fuck you.  The banks give you...  That's what Romney's talking about, Cutty.  What?  The mortgage deduction.  No, no.  Obama is doing it, sir.  January 1st, Obama is taking away mortgage deductions.  On second and third homes. 
[02:55:00]  But so what?  No, on certain income, if you make over $250,000 a year, and at certain levels, your fucking  mortgage deduction goes.  Your deduction goes.  Sorry.  Okay.  Yeah.  But even if it was second and third homes, like that's implying that you can afford it.  But that's not the government's business to fucking tax you more or not allow you a...  That's really irritating.  Why should you pay interest?  You're paying a vig to the bank.  Yep. 
[02:55:30]  And then you can't even write it off?  Well, you know what I'm going to wind up doing?  And a lot of people that are well off...  Well to do.  Well to do.  Do.  I'm just going to pay off my fucking mortgage and let the bank suffer because they're not  going to be getting any more of my interest.  Good job.  Good job.  And then what are they going to do?  Where are they going to get their money to lend?  Then they cut back on...  You know what?  That's what I did.  It's fucking ridiculous.  Well, you can't change this guy's mind.  He already voted for Obama.  Yeah, I know.  Well, good luck.  In a swing state too, by the way.  I hope you're good with that.  I hope you're good with your vote. 
[02:56:00]  Congratulations.  All right.  Thank you.  The phones will let...  We want to see what everyone's doing here.  Congratulations.  We've got about a half hour left in the show.  We've got Brian in Connecticut.  Brian, indie voter.  Who'd you vote for?  I voted for Obama and I will tell you exactly why.  All right.  But first I want to ask Anthony a question.  Certainly.  Men.  Are you a full-blooded Italian?  Well, I'm a full Italian, yes, but I'm half...  Right.  Yeah.  Stop right there.  Right.  I've raised German Shepherds all my life.  Yep.  Okay? 
[02:56:30]  Beautiful dogs.  Beautiful fucking dogs.  Purebreds.  Mm-hmm.  You know what the problem with a purebred is?  What's that?  They got no fucking common sense.  Mm-hmm.  I've seen they are smart dogs.  They are loyal dogs.  But they are fucking stupid dogs.  So what do you mean?  You're a stupid dog?  This guy's a lot of vote.  Call me a stupid dog.  I don't disagree with him.  A good old-fashioned...  This guy's a lot of vote?  ...a good old-fashioned fucking mutt.  Yeah. 
[02:57:00]  My...  I saw my German Shepherd one time...  Aw.  ...get...  ...get shot by a skunk three times.  Still didn't learn his lesson.  Aw, stupid dog.  Oh, God bless him.  My mutt...  She got hit by that skunk once.  It still didn't learn.  Aw, that's a shame.  You worked very hard.  You worked very hard...  Mm-hmm.  ...as a tradesman...  Yeah.  ...getting...  Wait, is he in a skunk?  Where you are...  What are you in this scenario?  I'm the dog.  You're the dog? 
[02:57:30]  Which dog, though?  Let me hear what this guy's saying.  What?  Sure.  Okay.  When I got my break, what?  When you got your break...  Uh-huh.  ...you took it.  You cashed in.  I have no problem with a self-made man.  All right.  However...  Right.  ...you forgot where you came from, young man.  I don't think I did.  Yeah, you did.  I honestly don't think I did.  Where did I...  Oh, Sandy...  Here's where I came from.  ...you came and you took out my power.  Yes, you blew it away.  Oh, Sandy... 
[02:58:00]  He's trying to do a parody.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to move on to...  I actually...  I know he was probably goofing, but I do remember where I came from.  I came from a place where no one gave me shit.  I was in the fucking dumper, and I managed to bring myself out of it in some way, shape,  or form.  I didn't just sit there.  I wasn't ever on the government fucking till.  I didn't have children out of wedlock because I realized, first of all, I didn't want any.  Secondly, it's an expense I couldn't... 
[02:58:30]  Secondly, it's an expense I couldn't have.  So, yeah, I do remember where I came from.  A shitty place where the government didn't fucking hand me money.  All right?  And that's where I want to be right the fuck now.  With the shit I made for myself, paying people to do certain jobs.  And I'm one of those guys now that paid me when I was working for a living.  There.  I don't think Anthony forgot where he came from. 
[02:59:00]  Anthony's a self-made guy.  Sometimes I do when I drink too much.  I'm driving home.  But he's not a guy who got...  You're a self-made guy, man.  You work, and it's like you resent anybody reaching into your pocket.  I understand that.  Yes.  I'm still Anthony from the block.  I used to have a little, but now I have a lot.  Absolutely.  I'm still Anthony from the block.  How did you pull that fucking in a nanosecond?  It was developed behind the scenes.  It was.  I mean, he rocks good, but it was...  He used to have a little bit.  He's not that good.  Yeah, Danny kind of started the idea. 
[02:59:30]  That was Eric.  Yeah, Anthony's a different credit.  For the Glocks that I got, I'm still Tony from the block.  My liver used to weigh a little.  Now it weighs a lot.  I'm still Tony the cock.  Let's go to Jim in Pennsylvania.  I'm right here, old Jim.  Gregorio.  Hey, Kumia.  Yo.  Yo.  Well, listen.  I worked for 32 years for the railroad.  Pacino. 
[03:00:00]  All the live long day?  Yeah.  All the live long day.  Wow.  I'm back on disability, and you're calling me a leech?  Ooh.  You go fuck yourself.  Yeah, right?  Wait, wait, wait.  Did I call you a leech?  Yep.  Anybody that's on a dole, government dole.  No, no, no.  Not anybody.  You worked.  You worked for a living.  No.  If you don't understand.  Yep.  If you don't understand what I'm saying, by the way I'm saying it, then you're an idiot.  I got it.  You're not a leech.  You're an idiot.  Hold on.  You worked for a living.  You fucking put your time in.  Put your money in.  And now because something happened, you're getting paid. 
[03:00:30]  That's fine.  I got no qualms about that.  Leech.  It's the people that have 10 kids and no fucking father around.  And they're just sapping off the fucking teat.  I got to back up, Anthony, on this one, Jim.  That's absolutely not what he's saying.  My God, man.  You paid into the system, sir.  There's a difference there.  For two years, I did.  Yeah, but he was kind of saying that you were a leech because you're on the dole.  Right.  Oh, no, Jimmy.  Jimmy.  I was not. 
[03:01:00]  All right, Jim.  Okay.  Take care of yourself, sir.  That ain't nice, dude.  Well, my apology, dude.  No worries.  I don't think that at all.  Let's go to the call in Massachusetts.  Nicole.  Good morning, boys.  Good morning, Nicole.  I just wanted to say thank you for listening this morning to the rant and to say that that  guy who called about the German Shepherd story, he's what's wrong with this country.  He's an idiot.  I was confused by dog guy.  Why?  Because purebred.  Would he go out on a limb and say that about African people? 
[03:01:30]  That they're purebred, so they're fucking stupid?  Like, he was insinuating that me, being all Italian, was the stupid German Shepherd getting  sprayed by a skunk?  Oh, that's what he was getting at.  Yeah, he was trying.  Oh.  Yeah.  Shit.  Yeah, let's see him be all ballsy and fucking go that route.  Let's go to Dean on Long Island.  Dean.  Hey, how are you guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, Dean.  Hey, yo.  I'm voting for Obama.  Oh, yeah?  Why is that?  Well, because who's going to pay my mortgage? 
[03:02:00]  Who's going to give me money for doing nothing?  All right.  Well, at least you got a valid reason.  I like people that actually put it in realistic terms.  If you want to do that, then that's fine.  And who's going to pay for my three kids with the girls that I've had babies with?  There you go.  I don't see anymore.  All right.  That makes perfect sense.  Good bit.  Thanks, sarcasm.  Let's go to Drew in Cleveland.  Drew.  Guys, it's an honor to speak to you.  What'd you draw?  Yeah, fucking a bunch of pictures or something. 
[03:02:30]  Drew.  Yeah.  Anthony.  Yo.  You are going to love me.  Oh, what?  Because I'm a Democrat registered.  Yeah.  And I just voted for Mitt Romney.  And you're from Ohio.  Yes.  Swing state.  I applaud you, sir.  Swing state.  I applaud you.  Now, were you old enough to vote four years ago?  I was.  And did you vote for Obama?  No.  Oh.  Gee, see, I'm...  That's the same vote, then. 
[03:03:00]  You were old enough to vote four years ago, then Anthony's not going to love you.  And the reason why is just because Obama really...  When you're in Senate for eight years...  Sure.  What the hell can you really get accomplished?  Absolutely.  I'm a political science student.  Uh-huh.  Poli-sci.  Poli-sci, yes.  Poli-sci.  I like Poli-sci-fi.  I like Poli wants a fucking cracker.  Give that fucking bird a cracker.  Have some soup, you fucking bird. 
[03:03:30]  I like Poli-o ricotta cheese.  I don't know what that means.  Stop being too fucking over my head.  Fucking cheese, you cunt.  I love cheese on a cunt.  Hey, give me some cunt cheese, please.  My cunt crackers.  Poli want a cunt cracker?  Hey, your bird's got a potty mouth chipper.  Hey, Poli want a urethane.  Poli want a urethane.  Hey, Poli want an amorous.  Hey, Poli want a graph.  Poli want a graph.  Ah, she's lying. 
[03:04:00]  Fucking wordplay stuff slays.  Poli want a myrrh.  I don't like that type of stuff.  Those are chemicals.  Space age polymyrrh.  Poli want a myrrh.  How about some frankincense?  Poli want an ethylene.  Hey, how about Poli want a purebred?  Poli want a purebred.  Sleep.  Fucking double beaks. 
[03:04:30]  Sean in Albany.  Sean.  All right.  What's up?  I'm a Republican, but I'm voting for Obama on this one because one of the most important  things in this election I don't think is being mentioned is that the next president will probably  get to pick the next two Supreme Court justices.  Maybe.  And that's going to make a big difference if you have two more conservative towards two  more liberal-leaning Supreme Court justices for the next 20, 30 years.  We've had a liberal-leaning Supreme Court and a conservative-leaning Supreme Court over 
[03:05:00]  the years.  And honestly, as far as the big changes go, I mean, the Democrats were frightening people  into thinking that if Romney is elected, Roe v. Wade gets overturned.  It's ridiculous.  That argument comes up every election, and it has since there's been Roe v. Wade.  And it just doesn't happen.  I think there's more important...  Hold on.  I think there's more important things to think about during an election, especially in the 
[03:05:30]  shorter term, four years of fixing things, than thinking of what ideology the Supreme  Court is going to be made up if something happens.  Let's deal with the situation we have right now, which is a fouled economy and a president  that doesn't know how to deal with it, a president that isn't a good leader, that has really  bullshitted his way through four years.  There's a cult of personality there that keeps people supporting him and voting for him, even 
[03:06:00]  under this shitty record.  And let's get things fixed right now for the shorter term, for four years.  Get someone in there that's a businessman that might know a little better who to delegate  certain responsibilities to, what policies to put in place that actually does build the  economy back up a little bit.  And stop this guy from just continuing his spend binge and getting us in massive debt  and really hurting the future of this country.  Well, the problem with Romney that I have is that he keeps referencing his five-point plan, 
[03:06:30]  but you go to look at it and it's as vague as it can possibly be.  Would you rather have something vague or a proven failure?  Think of it that way.  In all other terms, if you don't believe Romney, you don't believe the five-point plan, it's  too vague, wouldn't you rather have a guy that might do something?  Would you rather have a guy holding a gun on you or a guy that might have a gun that's 
[03:07:00]  about to hold a gun on you?  Let me know, because we're having a gun held on us right now.  Romney, he might hold a gun on us.  No, it's a gub.  It's a gub.  Spells gub.  No, I don't.  Take the money and run.  Oh, gub.  He's trying to rob the bankers.  All right.  Let me go to Matt in Indiana.  Matt.  Come on, Matt.  Get up.  Get off the floor.  Hey, you're full of shit.  I am?  Yeah, there's a big reason why the black community will support Barack Obama. 
[03:07:30]  Okay.  You look at women's issues, first of all.  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.  All right.  Nice.  The Fair Pay Act.  That is one very important aspect.  No, it's not.  That's a smokescreen issue.  There's already laws.  You don't think there's already equal opportunity laws in this country that prevent people from  getting equal pay for equal work? 
[03:08:00]  You don't think that's already there?  Not here.  Fuck Lilly Ledbetter.  Fuck that shit.  There's equal opportunity laws already in place.  It is against the law to pay someone less based on sex, religion, race.  Don't you understand that?  The fact that he didn't sign, the fact that he didn't sign Lilly Ledbetter was because  it also had other shit in it that he didn't agree with.  And?  Yes.  Stop screaming.  Listen.  I can't help it.  Yeah.  How about Lilly?  What's it?  A flower or something?  How about, how about, how about Ledbetter? 
[03:08:30]  How about Ledbetter?  Ledbetter in a valley.  Yeah.  Ledbetter, get up.  He's too heavy.  Ledbetter, Munster.  Ledbetter, Munster.  You know, Ledbetter, Aluminum Worth, fucking metal jokes, fucking, you know, fucking, yeah,  double heavies, Ledbetter, Lose Money, Ledbetter, Zeppelin, fucking double drums.  How about Planned Parenthood, Ant?  All right.  What about Planned Parenthood?  How about that one?  Government subsidies for Planned Parenthood? 
[03:09:00]  Yes.  You like that?  I do like that.  I honestly don't give a flying fuck.  I like that.  It's cold care.  Crime prevention.  Well, that's true.  Millions of women who get their actual health care from Planned Parenthood.  I think that was something that wasn't accurate, 100%.  They refer people to other doctors, but as Obama stated that they do mammograms and pap  smears at Planned Parenthood, they don't.  Yes, they do. 
[03:09:30]  No, they don't.  They don't do mammograms at Planned Parenthood.  They don't.  They don't do mammograms at Planned Parenthood, but they do get referred to doctors, and it  gets covered through Planned Parenthood.  They'll refer people, but they don't do the medical, they don't do the mammograms.  Who pays the bill?  Who pays the bill?  Planned Parenthood.  Oh, where does that come from?  That's who helps me.  More of my tax dollars.  Thanks, thanks.  More of my tax dollars.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's not money.  Go to two wars? 
[03:10:00]  It's not money that comes from...  If the wars are necessary, then sure.  What?  Were they necessary?  At the time, every fucking body thought they were.  So yeah, at the time, right after 9-11, everybody thought those wars were necessary.  All right, there were a couple of people, smart, brilliant people that didn't look at everything  and didn't have the emotion in their hearts that we wanted to pay back for 9-11, but at  the time, people wanted the wars. 
[03:10:30]  They absolutely did.  So my final point, and I'll let you guys go, is the same people who took us to war are  all of Romney's main guys directing him on foreign policy.  All George Bush people.  No, well, if we were taken to war because of the biggest terrorist event in our history,  perhaps that won't happen again?  And the neocons are firing up for Iran as soon as you get them...  Oh, stop it.  We are not. 
[03:11:00]  What a fucking...  That's like everyone during Reagan's campaign saying, if Reagan gets in, we're going to  war.  Oh, we're going to war with Iran.  Oh, boy.  And if anyone had a reason at the time, it was Reagan.  It's not the case.  This isn't George Bush coming into office.  Barack Obama and his campaign...  Hey, hey, hey.  Barack Obama and his campaign have done nothing but try to equate Romney with George W. Bush.  And they've been blaming George W. Bush for every bad thing he's done.  He's a different guy. 
[03:11:30]  He's more of a moderate than George...  He's more of a moderate than George Bush was.  And it's not surrounded by the same people.  And we're not in a war atmosphere like we were when George W. Bush was in, where we needed  to give retribution for a huge terrorist event.  Give me one different policy that he's proposed that's different from George Bush.  Different policy what?  What?  How about his tax plans?  His tax plans to cut taxes on the roof? 
[03:12:00]  No, they're...  It's across-the-board tax cuts.  And cutting out loopholes.  Oh, triple-ball economics again, right?  You know what?  You know what happens?  How about this?  Let me...  Let me...  Let me...  We were losing 800,000 jobs a month when Obama took office.  We've now had 33 straight private sector job creation months.  Stop it.  And we're losing jobs too.  The net...  The net jobs are down.  He talks about five...  We're losing jobs in the public sector.  He talks about five million jobs that he's created. 
[03:12:30]  He's lost ten.  When I go to the casino...  When I go to the casino and I bet $10,000 and I lose it, and then I win five grand, I  don't go home and say I won five grand.  I say I lost five.  He's talking about his winnings.  He's talking about his fucking winnings.  He's lost jobs.  Stop it.  We're over fucking 8%.  Stop it.  Black community, 14.5%.  Stop it.  800,000 jobs a month were being lost when he stepped in. 
[03:13:00]  It's not the same now.  God.  Fucking...  I hope the Kool-Aid's cold.  I hope it's icy cold.  Drink it up, my friend.  Drink up the Obama Kool-Aid.  We need some Kool-Aid or something.  Wow, this is exhausting.  Fucking exhausting.  I'm going to need a nap.  This is exhausting, man.  It really is.  I'm glad yesterday was a kettlebell day.  How good is that song?  Fucking great.  Should we take a break before Ricky Gervais or what? 
[03:13:30]  Fucking, I'm doing a show.  Why fucking five phone calls?  What are we doing?  Just let him come in.  Can I just do a single?  Is he still?  Give us an M-I-D.  I am...  He says, this guy says I'm voting for Obama.  I'm a firefighter.  This guy says another four years of Obama equals post-Sandy New York.  This is beeping.  Kevin from Connecticut just voted.  All I saw was old white people and young black people.  Oh, great.  They cancel each other's vote out. 
[03:14:00]  I have a degree.  The people Ann is talking about don't exist.  I got a mortgage deduction on my house.  Larry, Connecticut.  Drove from Rhode Island to New Hampshire.  And Rodney in Texas.  The only thing that Obama did that I agree with is two things he did by omission.  Well, you know what?  It's election day.  I'm not even going to say whoever you vote for, get out and vote.  I'm going to say Republicans. 
[03:14:30]  Republicans.  If you're a registered Republican and you're able to vote, please, especially in the swing states, get out there.  Don't just sit there.  Even if you don't think you're politically involved or anything, get out there.  Pull that handle for a mitten Romney.  Yes.  When it gets cold out, what do you put on?  Mittens.  Tomorrow's going to be very interesting in here.  Oh, boy.  Tomorrow's going to be very interesting. 
[03:15:00]  All right.  Take a single.  Get Ricky Gervais in here.  I can't stay for the Ricky Gervais interview.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Oh, look at him.  Here he is.  Hey, Ricky Gervais.  Come on in here.  We're already on.  Take us.  Oh, we're already on.  We do that.  This is how we roll.  Thanks for your tweet.  How are you doing, Ricky?  Oh, you are.  We're talking about the election there, sir.  Yeah, we've been talking about that.  Do you guys, you English guys, even give a shit about our election?  Well, yeah.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, well, you know, the leader of the Western world, it might affect us. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, that's true.  Well, so, yeah, I'm probably more interested in American politics than I am in English,  to be honest, but I know as little, so don't quiz me, because it would be embarrassing.  No, it's all the basics here.  We don't delve too deep.  We're not like, we don't have the map with all the states with the colors on them and  pressing buttons like they are.  That's delving deep, is it?  That's delving pretty deep.  You know what?  For most people...  See, this one's red, this one's blue.  Yeah, most people don't know.  They just go, they think, they actually think that if you vote for the president, it counts 
[03:16:00]  toward the election, which we all know, we're in New York, it doesn't matter who I vote  for, it's, the state is going to Obama.  I saw Jim's tweet, don't vote, don't waste your time.  I like the fact that he's bothering to tell them not to waste their time.  It means that much to you, they might waste their time by voting.  I love annoying them, because then they're all going to go, if everybody thought that  way, it's so pretty.  I love just riling them up.  What a bunch of dopes.  It really is fun.  You're huge on Twitter, Ricky.  Oh, Ricky loves getting people going.  I've become addicted, it's great. 
[03:16:30]  Usually I have to meet sort of morons and idiots from the company, but now I can just  do it from the company.  You have a world of them.  They're good.  And a lot of religious people like to tweet you.  Oh, I love talking to the fundamentalists.  And all you do is lambast them about the fact that they think the earth is 5,000 years  old.  But it's not so much their beliefs, it's the application of those beliefs.  They say things like, die atheist, usually spelled incorrectly.  It's usually I-E-S-T, like I'm the most a-thee. 
[03:17:00]  Like I'm not a-thee.  He's a-thee-er than anyone I've ever met.  He's the atheist, right?  And they say, die atheist, God is love.  Oh.  Things like that.  If you don't believe that, you'll burn in hell.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, yeah, they're fun.  Yeah.  But I also, you know, I follow like scientists and neurosurgeons and philosophers.  You know, it's not all mentalists.  No, no, not at all.  I enjoy your tweets. 
[03:17:30]  They're sometimes very thought out, sometimes not so much.  Sometimes you just post a funny face.  I do enjoy my face.  You're not, you know what it is.  It's the things it can do.  You've reached a point, though, where I think you've fallen into a place where you feel you're  attractive enough now to make ugly faces.  I don't know about that.  I don't know about that.  I was worried when I sort of lost a bit of weight so I didn't die.  Right.  That was the main reason, right?  That I couldn't still do these faces, but I was wrong. 
[03:18:00]  You just try a bit harder.  And I've discovered now that the bath pick is good because you're laying down.  It sort of helps that double chin.  Exactly, yeah.  A big double chin.  And if you get it just right, the water can distort your face even more.  So it really looks like roadkill.  I usually don't get my face in pictures.  It's usually from the waist down into a mirror, holding the foam like that at the right angle.  The sialis is just starting to kick in.  So it looks natural.  Maybe you should use...  You're blessed.  You've got a good face.  It's angry. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, thank you.  It's like a wasp.  It's like an angry insect.  Were you afraid that when you lost weight, though, that it was going to hurt you being funny?  Because a lot of times when you feel like if there's something about myself I don't like,  once that's gone, it's harder to find sometimes then.  Well, you can't win then, can you?  You know, I didn't do it for vanity.  And yet, you know, I admit that I did do it because I wanted to live a bit longer.  I like the idea that I'm going to let someone down.  Oh, he used to be funnier when he was fat.  I mean, he had three heart attacks, but I preferred it when he was sweaty walking. 
[03:19:00]  You know, yeah.  Who am I doing this for?  I'll tell you who, me.  Did you have heart attacks?  No.  Oh, kind of an asshole.  Assuming, like, that he might if he kept, you know, that road going.  I thought it was time.  I remember I woke up in a sort of a sweat after a sausage binge.  That's not a euphemism.  Is that?  Yeah, I was going to say.  Is that what they call it?  Yeah.  In prison it means something else.  It was called Lemon Party when I saw a picture of it. 
[03:19:30]  I remember last time I was on, you were showing me some of the most horrendous pictures I'd  ever seen.  Yes, they were awful.  And we don't even want to delve there anymore.  We've done enough.  That was so funny because you were saying, oh, get Carl Punkton on.  You want Carl Punkton to come on.  Yeah, yeah, Carl's hilarious.  And you said, and ask him what he'd rather do.  Yes, I saw that tweet.  The chick with the dick or the man with the boobs.  He has to do one of them.  The man with the vagina, actually, yeah.  Was it?  Yeah.  Okay, yeah, yeah, full on.  And I was saying, oh, they really want you on.  They really want you on.  Oh, and by the way, you've got to answer this question. 
[03:20:00]  And he said, I think I'll do CNN.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's sad.  He's got to do our show.  He's great.  I love his tweets.  They're fantastic.  Carl's amazing.  Oh, there you go.  How's that?  Oh, I forgot.  Ricky was a radio guy.  Okay, he's fixing the mic.  I think you're the first guest with our new mic stand so we can see you better.  I think Ricky's the first guest to ever touch his own mic stand.  I know.  That's great.  He didn't realize that he could sound better.  But he does do that.  Everyone else doesn't realize that.  Yeah, the rest of the day, if the mic falls on the floor, they just stare at it like it's 
[03:20:30]  going to fucking jump back up for them.  Pick it up, shithead.  We're not going to do it for you.  Oy, Brent.  My favorite person.  So, yeah, it is kind of fun to watch how upset people get on Twitter, like, with political  tweets and things.  Like, I tweet two opposite positions just to be dumb.  Yeah.  And it's like, who doesn't get that?  Like, why do people get angry about that?  I don't get it.  Well, because most of the human race are stupid.  Right.  I'd say 90% of them. 
[03:21:00]  I mean, think how smart the average person is and then work your way back to what makes  that average.  There's geniuses in the world.  Yes.  Then the average person is pretty dumb.  Then think of everyone beneath them, what they don't understand.  You know, they're scrabbling around.  They are fools.  They are proper, proper, some of them nearly brain dead.  Just to let you know why these guys are all, they're the ones that follow you.  Yeah, I'm not being rude.  Yeah, we got it.  We got a weird situation here today. 
[03:21:30]  This is so casual.  I mean, I'm not even sure what this is.  Is this going out on air?  Yes, it is.  You wouldn't care.  Who would tell you?  Is there someone listening to a actual radio to make sure?  They would let you know, Ricky.  Here's what's happening.  My house is out on Long Island.  Oh, wow.  I have no power, and it's a disaster, and I have to be home and meet power people.  Right.  Well, that's more important than this.  So I have to be leaving you in the capable hands of Jim Norton, Danny Ross.  Son of a month.  No, listen. 
[03:22:00]  Listen.  I've got to leave because I just don't like it.  Oh, my God!  Wow.  I've got to pick up my son.  No, no.  I would love to.  It's come to this, isn't it?  I love Ricky.  So I'm such a big star.  Jim Norton's in charge of me.  Jim Norton is capable hands, believe me.  They were actually...  You were going to come in at 10.15.  They were supposed to be gone already, and they were like, let's take a break.  So it's kind of a smooth transition.  No, no.  I like the fact that I was able to at least spend a couple of minutes with Ricky Norton.  Yeah, I figured you would want to do that.  My house is, have you heard about the hurricane?  Did you hear about that?  Yes, I have heard about it. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah, I came in the day after.  Yes, it's an act of scientists.  Wow, that's bad luck.  Well, you're doing a benefit.  Ricky's plugging a bunch of stuff.  One is here, November's two things.  The New York Comedy Festival is presenting.  It's a conversation with Ricky Gervais.  You're interviewed by John Hodgman, and that's November 7th.  You go to Ticketmaster for that.  And there's a benefit, November the 8th, the NYCF presents Stand Up for Heroes.  It's a benefit for the Bob Woodruff Foundation, which, of course, are you hosting that, or are you just on it? 
[03:23:00]  No, I'm just on it.  Me, Springsteen.  No, it's not only that I just call him by his surname.  I know, yeah, Springsteen.  But I put me first.  You should have.  I put me top billing.  There's me, the Beatles, Springsteen, Obama.  Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And Patton Oswalt's on it, and Robin Williams, and Jon Stewart.  But I love all those guys, but you're my favorite guy on that list.  So you should put yourself first.  And the Just Say An app, what is that at the App Store? 
[03:23:30]  Oh, that's just a little app I've developed with some internet muffins.  And you just, it allows you to talk on Twitter.  Just think how angry you could be, and how annoying you could be on Twitter then.  You just literally speak into it, and tweet it, and it comes out your voice.  Yes, so you click on it in Twitter, and it'll just start talking.  Yeah, yeah, you just, you just.  Whoa, so now you can get the, I hope people understand sarcasm now, because.  Well, that's the beauty of it, yeah.  Because the problem with Twitter is they don't get irony.  No.  And text it, they don't understand.  It doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't translate. 
[03:24:00]  Do you have it on your phone?  I do, of course, yeah.  So it's like, if I hit a tweet, will it give me an icon that says, okay, this is a verbal tweet?  Yeah, well, you could, you could also, they can get it with a text first before they press on it.  So you could, you could label it, you could say, my rant, and then it comes up a tweet,  they press on it, and the voice comes out.  That's fantastic.  But it's 140 characters, or no?  Uh, no, it's six minutes of.  140, oh, six minutes.  You talk, and it just cuts you off after 140 characters.  You've got to work out.  Exactly. 
[03:24:30]  I, I, I, H number eight, you.  Oh, yeah, that would be kind of silly.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, that would be silly.  Well, I kind of like that, because somebody had emailed me about something like that,  they're like, uh, yeah, we had this new talking, uh, tweet thing we're working on,  and I never, I never thought it would come to fruition.  So you could be, you guys, you're radio people, you could be walking along the street.  Right.  You could just, you could be broadcasting.  Mm-hmm.  Everyone who follows you on Twitter, and Facebook, anywhere it goes, you could just be,  you know, in six minutes.  You know what, though?  Well, I think that printed, for me, anyway, the printed word is a little less incendiary, 
[03:25:00]  and, um, I could, I could print out something, I could type something, and people can read  it and go like, uh, uh, but if I'm saying it, it'll be like, okay, he could lose his job.  But you're like me, though.  It's like, you're, you're worried about the technology because of the horrendous things  you might think and then say.  Horrendous things I say.  It's like, you're the sort of person who blames the microphone for being on.  Right.  Well, they weren't meant to be listening to my, the terrible, awful things I said. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Are you trying to spin it like Terry Bradshaw?  No, I was talking about Reggie Bush, but I meant Jimmy Johnson, you know?  LOL.  I think there's less ambiguity.  Yes.  I think people are getting the nuance more.  You, you know, you can, um, reiterate, you know, you don't, you don't have to send  it, you don't have to say it, you don't have to think it, it's it, it's in your hands.  Right, right.  And voice inflection, it really does soften her heart in a statement.  Yes.  Where, when you print it, it's just, it's out there. 
[03:26:00]  It's there.  And a lot of things look bad in print that wouldn't look bad if you said that or hear about it.  Exactly, yeah.  It could be taken out of context, yeah.  Exactly.  Wow, I want to get that now.  That sounds great.  I would love to abuse that.  Believe me, I know I would, too.  Ricky, you're going to have a great plan.  No, you've got to go.  It's just, listen.  I love that you're in there.  Good luck.  Best of luck.  When you say your house is in Long Island, did it start there or was it?  I'm hoping to be in one of the boroughs.  Okay, great.  Wow.  I'm out of power.  Good luck.  I'm on generator power. 
[03:26:30]  It's the worst.  It's just, I'm cold.  Last night, I was cooking a French bread pizza.  It took 30 minutes because it was in the toaster oven.  I took it out and dropped the cheese down on the floor.  Oh, no.  I was...  First the storm and then this.  Yeah.  Terrible.  Terrible.  I don't know what's worse.  Cheers.  Well, I'm just glad you're okay.  All right, see you tomorrow.  But yeah, he's got to go out. 
[03:27:00]  It's 50 degrees out there at night, 40 degrees.  They got no heat.  It was 30 last night.  No need to correct me.  You're right.  You're right.  No, not really.  It's just kind of...  I really could.  This is crazy.  You've taken over.  I know, but I'm just going to panic and shut down the show.  Well, that's it, folks.  You're going to be really nice and sensible and fair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, that's a good point, but let's...  What's your motivation?  I'm going to turn into a fucking fruit who's afraid of just tripping and falling on my face.  I don't do well alone.  I'm a good third mic, but in charge, I fucking flop time and time again. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, God.  Well, you've done well so far.  Yeah, so far.  We're a minute into it.  What can we talk about?  Can I have a question?  Sure.  Now, obviously, The Office is a huge show, and America is a huge show, but I'm not sure  if a lot of people know how The Office was developed in a lot of other countries as well, like India  and Russia and such like that.  So there's all these little local kind of regional offices, and I'm sure you must have seen some  of them, if not all of them.  No, I think there's French, French Canada. 
[03:28:00]  That's called La Job.  Yeah, I know I saw an Indian one.  I guess what the question was, have you seen them all?  And if you have, what's your favorite one?  Because they all are a little different, and they kind of play a little differently than you'd expect.  I probably like the French one.  Well, the American one is great.  Sure.  I love the American one.  That's fantastic, and that's really its own beast now.  But the French one was intriguing, because, did you ever see the remake of Psycho, where  they sort of did it frame for frame? 
[03:28:30]  With Vince Vaughn?  Yeah.  They literally did it.  Well, the French one was sort of like that.  They re-did the British version?  He touched his tie at the same time.  Oh, wow.  And they translated it sort of, you know, really spot on.  I didn't know that.  That was really weird to watch, because I couldn't understand what they were saying, but I knew  what they were saying exactly, because I knew the mannerisms.  Did the humor translate, though?  Is British and French humor?  Well, I think that's a myth that, I mean, outside sort of cultural reference, just doing  stand-up, I do it all over the world.  If they can speak English, you know, Scandinavia, lots of Europe, America, there's good comedy 
[03:29:00]  and bad comedy, dumb and smart, you know, and I have to change nothing at all.  As I say, outside of cultural reference, you know, I think the only thing I change is  wanking to jacking off.  I think wanking is a pretty universal word.  People know it, that wanking, oh yeah, what else could it be?  You know, I think people know it by now, but that's just, it's such a word, wanking.  If you tell me that you've gone off to have a wank.  I think wanking suits you more than jacking off.  I like, I mean, I wear both gloves well, but I prefer wanking. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Both are comfortable.  I think you can say, you've got the k in jacking off, and I think anything that's angry  suits you.  Yeah.  Do you know what I mean?  Wanking.  Wanking.  Wanking.  Yeah.  It's also something so self-loathing about the word wanking.  Yeah, it sounds like I'm not only pleasuring myself, but I'm punishing my dick.  I'm angry with it.  In fact, I would be disappointed if I enjoy this.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So that's it.  When you're dealing with things like famine and Hitler and stuff like that, everyone gets  that.  There are universal truths out there. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  Hey, what's wanking?  Sorry, jacking off.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a really good stand-up, too.  It's like, and I saw you once live only.  I was in the Paramount here in New York, I think.  I went.  I never go to comedy shows, but it was amazing to me how natural you were on stage.  Like, listening to you now, you're the same guy on stage, and that's really hard to do.  It's really hard to go up there and be conversationally funny.  Well, that's so funny, because that was my aim when I first started.  I was very nervous about doing stand-up, and I didn't do it until after the office,  actually.  But the whole idea, you want to be as funny as you are in the pub with your friends. 
[03:30:30]  Right.  And that's what this show's got.  This is, I mean, there's no show more natural than this.  I mean, as I say, there might as well not be microphones.  Right.  It feels like, you know, you're just hanging out.  So that's the idea, really.  Because all the funniest people you know aren't professional comedians.  They're your friends.  They're always your best friend is the funniest.  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You appreciate great comics, but there's nothing funnier than being with a friend or your brother. 
[03:31:00]  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  That's because it's the weight of investment you put into that.  You know everything they mean.  Every little nuance.  Right.  It's funny.  You know what they're thinking.  Well, that's changed for me over time, though.  In the 20 years I've been in stand-up, or 22 years now, that's changed for me a little  bit.  Where I don't see as many non-stand-ups as I did at one point, most of my friends are  comics.  So, like, those are the people that are close to me.  Well, that's true, of course.  Your friends become members of the same industry over years.  Yeah.  You've got...  But what I mean is, the more you understand someone, the funnier they are to you. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  It's that disconnect.  It's already quite a weird situation.  You're doing all the talking.  Right.  You're facing them.  You've got the microphone.  You know, that's hard to make natural.  It's hard to make...  And they want to feel that you're saying this for the first time.  They don't want to feel that they're a factory.  Right.  Right.  You know.  And that's what...  It disappoints me when I see a comic, and he tells a joke, and the audience don't laugh  much, and he says, oh, man, that usually goes down really well. 
[03:32:00]  And I want to go, why are you saying that?  Yeah.  Why are you telling them that...  Yeah, you're spoiling the trick.  Yeah, yeah.  And they got it wrong.  Yeah.  It's like you're blaming the audience.  You're idiots.  You know, you should laugh at that.  You should find that funny.  It's funny.  I did that last night.  I had a...  I did Hurricane material, which destroyed on Sunday night.  Killed.  Last night, bombed.  And I told them, I'm like, wow, this did really good.  So I kind of apologized and took half the blame.  I told them, like, I wasn't great, but you certainly weren't either.  So why do you think it didn't go down so well? 
[03:32:30]  They'd seen all the stuff on the news with other people...  No, no, no.  I knew why it didn't.  It's because I wasn't committed to it.  I was trying too hard to remember what I had said spontaneously the night before.  Right.  And so I wasn't in the moment.  Like, and I wasn't angry.  I didn't care.  Because it's material that's going to be gone in a week anyway.  But I knew it was...  I felt completely disconnected from what I was saying.  Do you ever do that thing?  Do you do tours?  Or do you do something different every night?  You get up there and spit what you've been thinking that day?  Oh, no, I go out and do my act.  I mean, and then I'll add to it.  Like, I try to build it in 20-minute increments at the Comedy Cellar, and then I'll go out and 
[03:33:00]  do a new hour.  Right.  Do you ever get that thing?  I get it very rarely, but now and again, it sends a chill down your spine.  When you start a routine, and because you've done it every day for, like, a month, you  suddenly think, have I just done this a minute ago?  Oh, the bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, on multiple show nights, definitely.  And I think, right, I'm going to get to the end, and I know if I've done it.  Will they laugh or not?  And I've never done it twice.  It's never, you know.  But it's just suddenly this really weird fear that I'm doing the whole routine again,  and I've just done it 30 seconds ago. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, I've had that on multiple...  Like, if I have two or three shows on a Saturday, then on a third show, you just fucking  loop it.  You're like, did I say that already?  And you're not sure what bit you did.  Is this guy a stenographer?  Danny's typing.  Are we in court?  I've got to get it all down.  There's people leaving to see the electricity man.  Some are going shopping.  They did both go.  I just realized...  Yeah, he has to pick his son up on Tuesdays.  Wow.  No, we really did want that vibe.  Sometimes people leave when you're hanging out with them, so... 
[03:34:00]  Yeah, and other people come.  It's amazing.  Other people show up.  My friend went to a play once.  It was above a pub, one of those little independent plays.  And he said it was him and one other person, right, in the audience.  So there's people doing this play, and there's two people in the audience.  And at one point, the other person went to the toilet and came back, and he pondered  that if he'd have went to the toilet as well, so there was literally no one watching, would  they have carried on or just paused?  Like TiVo.  Is that actually happening? 
[03:34:30]  It's like a zen, you know, and you've come back and you've missed a bit.  And if you came back and said, sorry, what happened?  Would they recap a little bit?  Would they go, oh, well, yeah, he thinks he's dead, but he's not.  Yeah.  It's weird, isn't it?  Yeah, because if you missed a critical point, and that's the entire audience, which probably  never happens.  How great?  That would be great if they both went to the bathroom.  That would be perfect.  I've seen that app that tells you when you have a toilet break.  Oh, yeah.  In for movies?  Yeah, I forget what it's called.  It basically tells you what the most boring or less pivotal scenes are, so you can just 
[03:35:00]  get up and shit.  How disrespectful is that for a film?  Looking through as a director, like, what movie is the shit scene in my movie?  Yeah, Schindler's List.  I really enjoyed making that scene.  I thought that was one that connected.  The old man with the shovel.  Come on, that was a great scene.  Yeah, it's called Run P.  Oh, amazing.  Yeah, but that is insulting to a director.  At least you know what part of your film people aren't enjoying if it makes the app. 
[03:35:30]  But it's another excuse for people to have phones on in the cinema as well.  I mean, why is that allowed?  I've got to see if the scene matches up.  So, I mean, who are these people on phones, like 15-year-old kids?  What are they doing, deals in Japan?  Why are they on their phone?  They just like the idea that they can do that in public.  It's almost weird.  It's like taking your dick out in public and knowing you can do it.  I probably showed a better example of that.  I mean, yeah, because I don't think that's it at all.  That was route one.  I need an analogy here.  Well, I'm always getting my dick out.  Let's use that.  Let's use the old dick analogy. 
[03:36:00]  Yeah, I mean, like...  It's just like kids going to movies and watching Facebook on their phones, taking their dicks out.  No, but I mean the arrogance of doing that.  It's being publicly shitty knowing you can't.  I'm allowed to do this.  Exactly, yeah.  There's no law against this, so I'm going to act like an idiot.  I'm going to do that.  Well, that's it.  There's no law against just being an idiot.  Yes, but there is one, I guess, one of them is pulling your dick out, so I completely  my theory is kind.  Yeah, that probably is...  My theory is destroyed, not the case at all.  No, it's awful.  Like, I could go out, you know, murdering people, for example.  No, that is actually illegal.  Yeah, that's against them.  Oh, yeah, sure, that's illegal, yeah.  So, you're enjoying doing stand-up and touring. 
[03:36:30]  It's like you are loving it, or are you finding a different grind?  I love it because it's a challenge.  I love it because I still...  It's really weird.  When I do a tour, once I get it right, everything's working, it's sort of exhilarating, and then  it sort of isn't anymore.  I don't get the buzz from knowing they're going to laugh at every point I know they're  going to laugh, you know.  So, it sort of becomes more of a science.  I like the bit when you don't know when it's going to go, so I always try and do a new 
[03:37:00]  couple of minutes every night.  Right.  Just because that's the thing that gives me the buzz.  That's the thing that I've got on adrenaline rush about that night, this new bit, and I  don't know how it's going to go.  And solving that is great.  I love the problem solving.  I love, you know, I love, and I've worked at things that are never going well, and I  don't give up, and then just something clicks one night, and that's exhilarating.  Well, the worst is when there's a bit that destroys one night, and it's off the cuff,  and it never works again. 
[03:37:30]  Like, for whatever reason, whatever line it was that made it work, the energy, the emotion  behind it can never be recaptured.  I agree, and I think I've got a theory about that.  You know Groundhog Day?  Yeah.  When he gets to the point when he's playing in the snow with her and he has a kiss, and  then he rushes to that, and it doesn't quite work.  He rushes to get to that moment, because he doesn't have heart in it.  I think that's what happens to us.  We forget the emotional move towards it, and so you rush to it, and you haven't given  them the same foreplay.  Yeah, and people feel it.  People sense it.  They do. 
[03:38:00]  It's on a subliminal level.  It's really weird, too.  When I'm plowing through an hour, and I was so happy to film something at the end.  It feels like that.  I know, yeah.  Wanking through an hour.  Wanking through an hour.  Wanking through an hour.  That's what we say.  But it was, and I was gearing up to shoot something at the end of April, and those last  weeks before I shot it were death.  Really?  Oh, my God.  It was, I fucking...  What's shooting the DVD, you mean?  Yeah, I shot a special in Cleveland.  I hate that night.  I hate that night, because I think the injustice, it's gone well for a year, and then it's 
[03:38:30]  like, it's like thinking about when you make contact with a golf ball, you know?  Uh-huh.  You get to the point where, oh, damn!  You practice, the swing's great.  Yeah.  You put a golf ball in front of it, and you certainly, and I just, I hate it.  I hate the night, I, and I, you know, it's there.  It's 99% the same as every other night.  Sure.  But, in your head, you're thinking, oh, I did that better last night.  Yeah.  You know, it's terrible.  It sort of screws you up.  Makes you a better comic, though, I think, because the fact that you care enough to think 
[03:39:00]  that, like, the true sociopaths who stink always think they did great, and they're always  like, oh, perfect!  It's a wrap!  It's like, oh, no, it wasn't.  But those are the guys who suck, because they never hear things accurately.  I think Leno described it years and years ago as laugh ears.  They hear everything is funny, and it's just not.  So, I prefer that perception of...  Well, they're delusional.  I've met a lot of comics, and I think, why did you think you would be a comic?  Right.  Why would you do this for a job?  Yeah, you don't like it, you don't like the audience, you don't enjoy it. 
[03:39:30]  You know, you're treating this, you thought it was a quick buck.  You're treating it like you're selling photocopiers or working in a bank or something, which  is fine, but it's not the same.  Of course.  You know what I mean?  Like, it's not supposed to be a job.  Like, this isn't supposed to be the profession I just chose.  No, I can't believe my luck every day.  Right.  That the best thing I could ever dream of doing is my job.  I'd be doing this anyway.  I'd be doing this anyway, in the pub or at school, mucking around to make people laugh.  Is it easier for you or more difficult when you start doing stand-up and you're already 
[03:40:00]  established as a funny guy?  Like, people already thought you're funny.  It swings and roundabouts.  You get five minutes respect.  You get more.  But then, if you're not the best person in the room, the height is doubled as well.  So how did you start?  Like, what did you do before you got on stage for the first time so you could avoid not living  up to people's expectations?  I remember the first time I tried stand-up.  I'd already done a bit of telly. 
[03:40:30]  I'd done a show, an 11 o'clock show, which was like a cross between this and Saturday  Night Live.  So it was sort of like sketches, but with swearing and horrendous subjects.  Like, anything went.  That's this part.  Yeah, exactly.  And so I was, you know, sort of a minor name in comedy.  So I went along to a comedy club one Saturday night and they went, oh my God, yeah, of course.  You're going to be amazing.  Right.  And I was sort of nervous. 
[03:41:00]  I was thinking, oh my God.  And people sort of buzzing in the room.  They go, oh, he's the guy from the telly, you know, because it was just like an open mic.  Sure.  And I had, and I had like three pints of lager, which is a dreadful mistake because  your timing goes, you know, and I got up on stage and there was the bright lights and  I went, wow, God, those lights are bright.  Silence.  And I thought, why are you saying that?  Yeah.  And then I went, so, and I did a routine and it went fine.  It just went fine. 
[03:41:30]  I did it.  But it's, it was a very fast learning curve.  Like, don't tell them what you're, what you can see.  They, unless they can see it too.  They don't know that that feels bright.  And they probably also don't want to see you up there as somebody who's like a rookie.  Like, shouldn't he know the lights are bright by now?  Of course.  Yeah.  That's another thing as well.  Yeah.  It's like hearing your pilot go, wow, this thing is fast.  Exactly.  Or a doctor going, oh my God, I knew I was going to do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's really bleeding. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah.  A little uncomfortable.  It's so funny because I'm not nervous.  It's, um, on planes.  But, um, whenever there's like a creak or a bump, I just look at the airs test.  And if she's ignoring it, I'm fine.  But if the day she goes, oh, fuck, what was that?  Yeah.  I mean, that's it.  I'm done.  That's, I mean, forget it.  Somebody told me they saw a flight attendant crying.  She was weeping during turbulence that was so bad.  And like, what a terrible thing to see.  Yeah.  A flight attendant crying.  Because you want to tell yourself, I'm sure this happens all the time.  And then you look over and the flight attendant is bawling. 
[03:42:30]  That's only a nice sight if she's leaving your hotel room.  Then you're like, all right, I did my job.  I actually don't watch that safety video anymore.  It angers me.  It really angers me.  Because it, it's, that's never going to happen.  No one's ever going to think back and go, now what did they say?  Right.  That's not going to happen.  You're going to be screaming and crying.  And, you know, that thing about, um, if you're in the, the, uh, exit seat, you may be asked  to help.  That's out the window.  I'm, I'm first out the door.  Yeah, of course.  I'm not helping anyone.  No.  I'm stepping over people.  Right.  Um, and, uh, and they say that thing they do when they say the brace position, that's 
[03:43:00]  not going to do anything.  No, it's not.  And watching, watching the mothers like calmly put the oxygen mask on and then slowly put  it on their child.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Now we're all secure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I don't know why.  I don't even know where they have them that they just say, listen, if it crashes, we're  all dead, but it's almost certainly not going to crash.  So don't even think about it.  Right.  Don't worry about it.  It's not worth worrying about.  Yeah.  Cause it either does or it doesn't.  And if it does, we're dead.  So yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're not going to be any use at all. 
[03:43:30]  Right.  So how could you worry about that anyway?  You can't stop it.  It's just like life.  Right.  Yeah.  We would ask you to help, but you're probably not going to live through it.  So your help won't be needed.  I don't know if I want honesty like that.  I kind of, I have to go disagree.  I like the bullshit they give us.  It's comfortable.  Yeah.  I wouldn't want that kind of honesty.  I went on a plane once with Louis CK.  Remember him?  Oh yeah.  When he was friends with you, but now he doesn't even return.  I texted him this morning.  Yeah.  Fucking creepy Louis.  I'm like, Hey, Ricky's coming in.  If you want to come in, no word back.  Nothing.  Why were you?  I mean, I, I mean, you guys sort of found him in the gutter, but then I gave him a bit 
[03:44:00]  of a break.  You gave him a big break.  Yes.  You know, he's absolutely nothing.  Yeah.  Right.  Right.  And then he doesn't even return.  And knowing you're going to be here.  He's still like, yeah.  Three days later, he might just send a thing like, I hope you get AIDS.  Yeah, exactly.  And that's like, I go, Oh, thanks.  Cheers, man.  Then you're like, why would he say that?  And you're like, Oh, it is my birthday.  Yeah.  He's probably listening now though.  Pretend he didn't listen, but he is listening now.  Yeah.  He is a sneak.  And I just want to say that Louie naked looks like the thing that's been healed. 
[03:44:30]  So there you go.  That'll teach you.  What a great Fantastic Four reference that is.  He, um, yeah, I was in Lucky Louie.  I saw him naked.  He did a scene.  I forgot he did that nude scene in Lucky Louie.  And I loved him for that because it was such a fucking disaster.  I did it.  I did one in Louie where I was his doctor, Dr. Ben, and I had to give him an ass exam.  Right.  The pants were down in that as well.  Oh, he was naked for that.  I mean, how, I mean, she, how fat does he have to get until he stops being proud of 
[03:45:00]  that flabby white ass?  He really is amazing how he has embraced physical atrociousness.  You have to respect that about Louie.  Yeah.  Ricky, you didn't post the underwear shot of yourself until you were nice and in shape  and you could share your new body with the world.  Oh, no.  There's loads of pictures of me with the gut out and the boobs.  Oh, yeah.  Can we find some of them?  I'd love to have them.  Yeah.  Put in fat man boobs and I come up.  I actually put in fat man boobs and I come up.  It's just razor.  Number one. 
[03:45:30]  Just man boobs.  What was it they were calling you?  What were they yelling at you in the fucking Christmas special?  They like to yell things.  It's not always good.  Twatty beard.  He has put man boobs into Google and that's horrendous.  Yep.  And the second photo, yeah.  Jack Nicholson and then Ricky Gervais.  What would you know?  That's ridiculous.  Look at that.  That's ridiculous.  Wow.  This is radio.  This is, I mean, this shows contempt for your audience. 
[03:46:00]  Yeah.  The fact that we're looking at pictures and going, wow, that's amazing.  And we're saying like as if we're not doing a bad job.  Well, they could Google man boobs, too, and they could see it at home.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's in your hands.  It's a shared experience.  This is interactive.  Yes.  I Twittered a photo of myself in my, I took photos years ago in Calvin Klein boxers, underpants.  And I Twittered it very recently again.  And I was talking to a girl on a date within the last couple of days.  And she's like, yeah, I saw that picture you Twittered.  And I was fucking humiliated. 
[03:46:30]  I'm like, oh, my God, I forgot that women I'm trying to sleep with read Twitter.  How's that going?  Not well.  Not well.  Not well at all.  I'd love to see that.  I'd love to have a hidden camera with you on the date.  Oh, that's the photo.  So where do you meet people?  On the internet?  Through Twitter or through…  So how does that go?  So you tweet someone and what happens?  Tell me the process.  This is fascinating.  Okay.  Well, I'll send them a private message if they're following me with my email in it.  That's already creepy.  That's already creepy.  Yeah.  Hi.  How are you?  You have to start following them. 
[03:47:00]  So the first thing they notice.  What do you say?  So you start off, I mean, at least it's Twitter as opposed to a note through the door.  I'm following you.  Hi.  I've been watching you for a few.  So you say, hi, is Jim Norton here?  You may have heard of me on the Open Antony show.  No, no, no, no.  I'll respond to…  No, I don't even follow them.  I just send them a…  If they're following me, I send them a DM with my email in it.  The real Jim Norton at Gmail.  Right.  If they want to contact me, they do.  And then if they do, we begin chatting.  And then immediately from chatting, you can possibly go to text.  And that is when you can start asking for photos as soon as you get to the text messaging. 
[03:47:30]  Right.  It's all very formulaic.  It's not romantic.  And you've got to the point where you then say, do you want to meet up for a drink?  Yeah.  I mean, if it comes down to them needing a drink, a lot of times it'll go right past that and say, do you want to come over?  And they'll come over.  Right.  It doesn't always work that way.  And tell me…  I don't want to hear when you're successful.  That's boring.  Yeah.  And mildly disappointing.  Yes.  And believe me, there's not that many of those.  Exactly.  So what's the worst look you could see in their eye when they met you? 
[03:48:00]  Sobriety.  Being fucking wide awake.  You know, I like that Rohypnol fucking half a fucking lid shit.  Okay, and we cut there.  Let's go to some adverts.  I like…  No, the worst look is when I know that they just wanted to meet me because they were curious.  Right.  It's like, I'm a dirty guy.  Like John Merrick.  Like…  Look at the girls who are in a museum and look at the show in a fucking jar. 
[03:48:30]  As opposed to a romance.  I'm not an animal.  I just want to see if it talks.  There's a guy holding…  There's a guy pushing my face and her face together.  Give him a kiss, love.  And she's screaming.  Oh, God.  Oh, amazing.  The life of Jim Norton.  Yeah, that is a…  What a great call that was.  That's what it feels like when I know that they're just curious as to what I was like.  And is he really this dirty?  And sometimes they're guys.  Like, I'll get a lot of tweets from pretending to be girls.  Oh, Jim, this is amazing.  Yeah, and they'll try to get dick pictures. 
[03:49:00]  They'll try to get pictures of my dick.  What?  Like, they'll go that far as to be like…  Yeah, it's a goof.  And how many men have you sent pictures of your dick before you knew it was a dick?  Hold on, why are you sending women pictures of your dick?  It doesn't matter if they're men or women.  What sort of behaviour is this?  Well, it's…  This didn't happen.  Keats didn't do this.  They didn't find those.  Please, I'm drawing a picture of your fanny.  But if he could have, he would have.  I mean, if they had that technology, they would have.  Keats wouldn't do that.  Keats, Byron.  I love that.  I love the idea of these guys on Twitter.  So, you think it's a woman, but it's a man. 
[03:49:30]  I've had a few mistakes, but I can usually smell that.  I'm usually pretty good at picking that out because they talk like men.  Women don't say certain…  What do they say?  It's just, it's an instinct.  It's a guy thing.  They, like, you know, like, ask, you know, like, you know, like, the first…  No woman would ever want to see my penis.  This is clearly a man.  I know a woman wants to see it if I ask her, and her response is, um, okay.  Oh, my God.  Oh, God.  I feel like Agent Starling. 
[03:50:00]  That's cool.  Hannibal Lexington.  Wait till you see what I throw at you.  Oh, God.  Yeah, but you know what?  It's all voluntary, and it's dirty, and women who are up on texting, it's fun, and it's  dirty, and I like getting pictures of them, too.  Not only does Jim send, like, pictures of his dick to women, I've traveled with them.  You know those commercials that say, don't text while driving?  And there's this sort of mundane text that happened where Jim will send dick pictures  and dirty text while he's driving state to state.  But imagine him crashing. 
[03:50:30]  Exactly.  And they put him out of the wreckage.  He's just got an unsent tweet.  Just in his little dead fucking hand.  And it's just a picture of an old, gnarled cock.  And his cock's still out where he's just taken the picture.  And that's been severed now, and his balls have burst.  Yeah.  His fly is unzipped, and his dick is across somewhere in the other lane.  It's the worst disaster movie ever.  It's like something from Saw 3.  This is a great script for English lessons with Ricky Gervais. 
[03:51:00]  Partil.  Caption this.  Oh, God.  That would be embarrassing.  I'm always worried about that.  Like, you don't want to die sending a text or have people go back.  That's never been...  I can honestly say, right, I've never had that as a worry in my life.  I have never woken up and gone, God, I hope I don't die while texting a picture of my cock to someone.  You know what it is?  And I mean, that's just not something you do while you drive.  Actually, I don't drive. 
[03:51:30]  I have a few good pictures of it.  So it's like, because everything else with me is kind of disastrous, so if they think that's...  It's like you've got to work with what you've got.  That's something you're proud of.  That's your best asset.  No, comparatively speaking.  I mean, compared to...  You know, I have good cabs.  Those are actually my best, but nobody wants to see that.  Do you ever send a picture of your face, for example?  No, why would I?  For what?  Why would I send my fucking medical reports?  You don't kill the deal before you get there.  Oh, God.  That's a terrible move.  Well, that was a good one. 
[03:52:00]  The stenographer's got that down.  That'll be read back when I'm in jail.  Yeah, but let's plug what Ricky's got, too, because he's here plugging stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Just saying, Ab.  You can listen to Jim Norton on just saying.  He can send you a picture of his cock, and he can describe it.  Yes, and I can tell you where I was when I took it.  I love when you send a great picture of your dick, and women are like,  is that a stock photo?  Like, do you send that to other girls?  Yeah.  I like when you bring up references.  Like, we can relate to it.  Like, we send tons of dick pics out to everyone. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah, exactly, yeah.  Like, it never happened to me.  Oh, that happened to me, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Stock photo of your dick.  Where do you keep stock photos of your dick?  You guys are healthy guys in relationships.  Maybe I've had a rougher go of it, as we say.  It's at Ricky Gervais on Twitter, and of course, there's Just Say and Ab,  which I really, really want to get.  November 7th, here at the New York Comedy Festival,  it's a conversation with Ricky Gervais,  and he's being interviewed by John Hodgman.  Are you taking questions from the audience,  or are you and he just speaking?  Yeah, we just do a chat, and then we do a Q&A, 
[03:53:00]  and he's a very funny man.  It's like he got in a time machine.  It's like he's come from the 18th century, John Hodgman.  I like him.  I don't know who he is.  You don't know John Hodgman?  No, no, I know that.  You know, he played the PC on the commercials,  and he's done a bunch of stuff with,  what award show did he do the voiceover for?  I think he did the Emmys.  And he's a contributor on, look,  he looks like a wise owl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's like, in a comic book,  if you had magic pipes and you made an owl into a person,  it would be John Hodgman.  Yes, he really does.  Yeah, I've seen him before, I definitely have. 
[03:53:30]  What ginger have?  I hope it's not hungry.  Do you know him well, or is it just...  Yeah, I know him pretty well.  Again, probably someone has sent him a link  for me slagging him off on...  That's Louis C.K. and John Hodgman after us now.  Oh, Louis and John?  Yeah.  Well, Louis can still really help me.  You're way beyond, like, you're in great shape already,  so I still have to be nice to Louis,  because I'm still really hoping for season four.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm coming up with storylines and everything.  How about me?  I'm your long-lost brother.  Yeah.  So it's a car crash. 
[03:54:00]  My dick's in my hand.  That's one he'd actually probably write up.  But he would, you know.  All right.  And also, the show on YouTube,  it's called...  Is it called Learning English with Ricky Gervais?  Oh, we just did a pilot, yeah.  We checked that out on YouTube.  And what do you have streaming on Netflix?  Oh, yeah.  No, my new show, Derek, is coming to Netflix next year.  So I'm very excited about that.  It's called Derek, and it stars myself and Kyle Pilkington,  and it's set in an old people's home.  And it's sort of weird, and it's quite sweet as well. 
[03:54:30]  It's probably the most dramatic thing I've done.  Is he for real, too?  Because I watched the...  It's like...  I mean, you know him for a long time,  but that's really who this guy is.  Yeah, he is like that, yeah.  Yeah.  In fact, he's probably getting more belligerent and angrier.  And I like that mix that he's got.  You know, like Homer Simpson's at his best,  when he mixes sort of arrogance with his stupidity.  Right.  Well, Kyle's got to that stage now.  He's sort of cocky about stuff.  Like he knows he's famous.  I remember once I was explaining evolution to him  for about the 50th time.  And he went, yeah, I've got the gist of it. 
[03:55:00]  I know it went germ, fish, mermaid, man.  Yeah, of course it did.  Mermaid.  How do you stop Carl from being self-aware?  Like, with the weirdos that we have on our show,  eventually they kind of tune in on what people are laughing at,  and they just kind of stop doing it,  and we get to get rid of them.  What's the good thing about it is fame makes him better at that.  He sort of hates society even more now he's famous,  and he has to hide even more,  and he's become more sort of misanthropic.  And so it's good.  It's working in my favor at the moment. 
[03:55:30]  Also, I've got so much sort of stock footage of him  that even if he got a bang on the head  and became sort of normal and intelligent,  I'd have loads of old stuff.  You have years of stuff in the vault.  The same is it.  If you lost your dick, you've got so many photos of it.  Not if, Ricky, when.  It's going.  I just don't know how or when.  It's like a baby tooth.  It's wiggly now.  Yeah, believe me, there's not much life left in it.  I'm up to a 20 milligram Cialis to get it to move.  At this point.  Do you have those dreams when you're suddenly on stage  and the microphone is your dick and it's come off  and you can't plug it back in? 
[03:56:00]  Yes, and it's black and it's attached to someone else.  I don't know what it's telling me.  And you're not talking into it because your mouth is full.  And I'm awake and I'm daydreaming.  I think you've done a great job of standing in.  I do have weird dreams like that,  but I never went to performing, though.  I never have weird fear of performing dreams that I can remember.  It's always other stuff, but performing is like, eh.  Yeah, no, anxiety dreams for me is always stuff.  It still goes back to being at school,  like turning up to school without your shoes 
[03:56:30]  or you've got an exam and you didn't even know  there was an exam that day.  I'm constantly waking up trying to figure out  if I'm done with school or not because that's all it is.  I'm sure I'm still in college.  I've got a ton of papers that are due today.  But do you get that thing also like you're at school or college  or an old job and you suddenly go,  I don't need to be doing this now.  I've got a radio show.  Right, exactly.  And you suddenly go, I'm going to leave.  I could just leave.  No, never in the dream.  I'm always there.  And then literally I wake up  and you're kind of groggy in the beginning  and I'm sitting there going, 
[03:57:00]  all right, do I have to finish school?  I'm not sure.  I don't think so.  And then I start thinking, oh, no, no, no.  Okay, I got a radio show.  I got things going on.  I'm done with that.  That was actually many years ago.  That's good because Jim got in trouble.  Well, he still turns up to school with his dick in his hand.  I do.  I'm like, your regular teacher's sick.  We're like, Jim, second grade was years ago.  Cold words are for nerds.  This is the greatest radio show on the planet Earth.  It is great to be able to say what you want. 
[03:57:30]  I mean, satellite radio is fun, man.  You don't have to ever,  doing this on regular radio would be awful.  It wouldn't happen, would it?  No.  I mean, we tried it.  Yeah.  Well, we tried it,  but we sort of did something like this on regular radio.  Not as crazy.  And we got away with it,  but then we realized it was because no one was listening.  There was nobody to be offended.  We had to make up our own complaints.  Who got in trouble?  Didn't Russell Brand get in trouble recently with somebody else, too?  Wasn't he on?  He said something a couple of years ago, right?  Yeah. 
[03:58:00]  But again, that's BBC,  so they can sort of fire you.  BBC radio.  Yeah, because you break the decency law or something like that.  It's the same thing here.  I mean, on terrestrial.  Satellite, it's got to be for, you know,  because the company gets angry at you.  But you can still, you can still libel someone.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's...  That's the big, that's the always the worst.  That's something you don't do.  It's not fair.  You shouldn't do that anyway.  So, apart from that,  I've never really understood swearing. 
[03:58:30]  You know, swearing, swearing.  It's just a word.  Yeah.  But it's the racial stuff.  Like, the minute you say racial things,  you just have to pray that nobody gets on television  and starts complaining about you,  because the minute they do...  But then, but then, that's...  Yeah, well, that's a subtle point,  because it's okay to do, say, racial stuff.  You don't have to be racist to discuss race.  Of course.  And I think people are idiots.  They see a taboo subject,  and they always confuse the target with the subject.  Now, I do loads of racial stuff. 
[03:59:00]  I do loads of stuff about disability,  about those things,  without being disabilist or racist.  Right.  And I think people, they don't...  They get confused.  They worry about it.  They think they should complain.  Some people just want to complain.  But that's back to your point about people being stupid.  Like, they feel like if they can get mad about something...  Of course.  ...then they have a cause,  and then they have intellect.  Yeah.  So now, I'll just be mad because he said something racial.  Yeah, and they don't understand the point you're making very often.  And also, just because someone's offended,  it doesn't mean they're right.  I just think this... 
[03:59:30]  Right.  It's got to the point now where, you know,  people think if they shout enough...  People think they have the right to not be offended,  and they don't.  Well, they also...  They just don't have the right not to be offended.  It's an attention-seeking device, too.  Well, it is.  I think a lot of people just want to be heard.  Yeah.  You know, but...  Well, I mean, it was the same thing with the Golden Globes thing,  when people were complaining because you were mean.  Yeah.  At the Golden Globes, and you're going,  what are you talking about?  Well, that's subjective.  It was like, what's mean, really?  I gently teased some of the richest,  most privileged people on the planet about a movie. 
[04:00:00]  Right.  You know what I mean?  It wasn't a room full of wounded soldiers.  These people, you know,  they were going home with an award later.  For making a movie.  And let's be serious.  They weren't offended.  There was no one in that room was really offended.  A lot of them looked around to think of it.  Again, it was a couple of people in the media.  If someone shouts controversy,  it suddenly makes it true.  I want to go, no, it's not controversial.  Then I've created controversy.  I'm now arguing about whether something's controversial or not. 
[04:00:30]  And that's exactly what they want.  The best thing to do, ignore it.  Yeah.  Do your own thing.  Answer it if you want to.  But nothing happens.  That's the thing.  If you don't break the law, nothing happens.  You can, you know,  there can be an angry mob demanding,  just sells more tickets.  Fuck them.  You know, they can't do anything.  They can't do anything.  I find myself a belligerent.  I get so aggravated at those people.  And I find responding to them,  and responding slash attacking them,  not if it's an issue of race or whatever, 
[04:01:00]  but more about the fraudulence of their outrage,  or the fraudulence of their complaint.  That's exactly right.  I don't buy it.  They've got it wrong.  And now they're as angry.  I mean, also, it's about the subjects.  Like, the subjects.  There's no subject you can't joke about.  It depends what the joke is.  I hate this absolute thing.  You can't joke about race,  or you can't joke about rape, even.  Right.  Something as horrendous as rape.  It depends what the joke is, you know.  I remember there was a thing on Twitter  where this woman said,  I will laugh at a rape joke 
[04:01:30]  the day I know no one in the audience has been raped.  And I tweeted back,  what a strange door policy.  Whoa, this is rubbing salt in the world.  I can't come in because what?  Technically, that's a rape joke.  Yeah.  So theoretically, somebody...  So it's got the word rape in it.  Yeah.  You know, but there's no...  You know, I think what they mean is 
[04:02:00]  there is a victim of that joke  who doesn't deserve it and can't help it.  And that's true of some things.  You don't make fun of someone  because of their race  or because of their sexuality,  but you can make jokes  about race and sexuality  without...  Concepts.  It's got to be infused with hatred.  Comedy comes from a good or a bad place.  And intelligent people know the difference.  Some people are so stupid,  they're as angry about jokes  about bad things 
[04:02:30]  as the actual bad thing themselves.  I want to go,  well, that proves you're an idiot then.  Right.  You're an absolute moron.  As if somebody raped  because they heard a joke about it.  Of course.  Then this is okay.  That's never happened.  And that's never happened.  No, never.  Never.  How could it?  Rapists generally  probably don't have great senses of humor anyway.  I don't think they...  They go down on Twitter and go,  well, any jokes today?  Yeah.  That's one.  Where's my mask?  And it's funny. 
[04:03:00]  The people don't call actors out.  I've been complaining about this for years.  It's like actors have carte blanche as artists.  So do painters and songwriters.  Of course.  But as comics,  for some reason,  feel that their input creatively  is important  and it drives me crazy.  It's like,  I don't be...  It's because we flip  from the things we really mean  and are passionate about  to things we don't mean.  That's what a joke is.  Right.  Okay.  Whereas an actor's always saying something  he doesn't mean.  He's acting a role.  Whereas we're under our name  and it confuses people. 
[04:03:30]  But again,  smart people can tell  when you're passionate about someone  and you mean it  and the target is the same target  of your passions.  And when you're playing a character  and getting stuff wrong  and saying things  because they're not,  you know,  I think that  there isn't anything  you can't joke about.  I think you've got to look  at everything in context.  I agree.  And it's like Kevin Bacon,  great job in The Woodsman  as a child molester.  But if you make fun of pedophiles  or you make a pedophilia joke,  you're a terrible guy.  But if you're an actor  and you play that, 
[04:04:00]  it's like,  God,  it was brilliant.  And it's like,  what's more psychotic?  Somebody who can mock pedophilia  or somebody who can actually  accurately portray one.  But also,  what comedians mock  someone who's a victim of pedophilia?  They're always mocking the pedophile.  They're always making this,  you know,  I mean,  you could say it trivializes it.  But I think,  who in the audience  is thinking,  well,  I'm laughing at that joke.  So,  you know what?  Pedophilia isn't so bad.  There's no one.  And if they do,  they're already a psychopath.  You didn't make them a psychopath.  They don't let the,  nobody lets the marketplace 
[04:04:30]  kind of dictate.  You know what I mean?  Like,  if this person was offending  that many people,  he would never sell  that many tickets.  Well,  exactly.  You know,  if people are still paying  to go see you.  And I never go out to offend  and I never embrace that thing,  come and see me,  I'm a shock comic.  Right.  I think it's churlish and boring  and I think the people  that do are lying.  Those comedians who say,  I say things that,  as the unsayable.  No,  you don't.  There's people laughing and clapping.  And I also,  you know,  be locked in your dressing room  with an angry mob.  That's you saying the unsayable.  You know,  most people don't do that.  There was a thing 
[04:05:00]  a few years ago in England  a paper's picked up on,  you know,  everyone's a paedophile  to a frenzy,  right?  To the point where  in Portsmouth,  a paediatrician  who had a plaque  outside his door  had his surgery burnt down  by an angry mob  who was so fucking stupid  they thought a paedophile  would put a plaque up  saying paedophile.  It's my place of business.  I perform pedophilia here.  I see children  between nine and five.  Then I go home. 
[04:05:30]  If you're over this height,  you cannot get on the ride.  Oh my God,  that one's a dwarf.  And they're telling us  we have a couple of minutes.  So I'm not rabbi,  I just want to give  the plugs out again.  November 7th,  just go to Ticketmaster.  Ricky is at the  New York Comedy Festival.  Do you know what?  I think they're sold out.  Are they really?  Yeah,  I think we're just  winding people up here.  Oh good,  I like that.  You know what?  Go to Ticketmaster then.  There might be some returns.  Yeah,  go try it.  Yeah,  just,  I'll see you,  when is it?  Wednesday and Thursday,  isn't it?  November 7th and November 8th. 
[04:06:00]  Oh yeah,  it is this week,  Jesus.  Yeah,  a conversation with me  on I think Wednesday  and then the Bruce Springsteen gig.  See,  I gave him top billing then,  didn't I?  Yeah,  but that's just because  you're being modest.  I know.  Who's the boss really?  Let's be serious.  Yeah,  come on.  Are you amazed by the way  when you meet  and just say an app?  Just say,  I'll download the just say an app.  It's free.  That's the point,  it's free  and you can talk  and you can send  Jim Norton  really abusive messages.  And I'll play them.  I'd love to hear them.  What's great about the just say an app  and there are a few apps  that people are like  really downloading  that people are figuring out 
[04:06:30]  that you could talk  into your phone again.  Like nobody was talking forever.  Like Apple came out with Siri  and all of a sudden  people are like,  oh,  I could talk my text message?  But you know,  there's a syndrome now  with kids  that are brought up  on social networking.  They can't interact properly.  Right.  Because they're so used  to typing  and abbreviating.  They don't look you in the eye.  They can't really converse  one to one.  And they're having to sort of like  try and sort of socialize them again  because they,  they,  they,  it's weird,  isn't it?  So yeah,  maybe,  maybe this is a good thing. 
[04:07:00]  Maybe to get them talking again.  It is weird too.  I've gone through entire relationships  through text message.  Like really,  really bizarre,  you know,  to I love you  and blah,  blah,  blah,  naked pictures  to all of a sudden  we fade away  and stop talking.  It's amazing.  Start to stop  as text messages.  Do you know the fade away?  Does that come after  you send them  an unsolicited picture of a dick?  You know what?  That doesn't help all the time.  Once in a while  you want it to.  The thing is,  what makes me laugh is,  you know what,  like people like yourself  who are dating and stuff  and you send,  you know, 
[04:07:30]  you send old pictures  or pictures where you look  slightly better.  Why don't you send  someone else's dick?  Because that,  I don't,  because I don't,  I don't like,  I don't like dick.  If your head's not in the shot anyway.  Just send someone,  send someone as a,  because it's bait and switch.  I don't like bait and switch.  I wouldn't like that  if I was buying a car.  I don't like it  when escorts come over  and that's not the one in the ad  and I'm not going to send my penis.  It's an honourable thing.  It's an honour.  I wouldn't feel good  about the compliments  if it wasn't mine.  But let me put the mind to rest.  They're never going to get  to see you really good.  They're all going to fade away 
[04:08:00]  via text.  Just enjoy the fantasy.  You know,  you're really,  I really should be sending out  a fake one.  What a dope I am.  What a time to have integrity.  Now the integrity kicks in.  Or at least one without  all the warts and postulations.  Alright,  well that's a great point.  Why don't I send out a stunt dick?  Thank you everyone.  The great Ricky Gervais.  Go and vote.  Don't listen to Jim Norton.  Go and vote.  Come on.  If you're registered.  People fought for the right  for you to vote.  Go and vote.  Who would you vote for?  Obama.  What?  The real president,  not the one with the magic hat. 
[04:08:30]  I'm very much in the middle.  I honestly don't know.  What do you mean?  I like,  I'm not allowed to vote.  This is so frustrating.  I like Obama's social policies  as far as like gay marriage  and gay as the military  and all these things  that he's for.  Yeah.  You know,  science.  But with taxes,  I prefer some of what Romney says  like as far as,  you know,  certain write-offs  and things like that.  I don't want my money  I love that.  I love your reasoning.  Yeah,  it's like I kind of like  a little bit of both.  Okay.  Third party.  We need a third party.  Two parties.  You know Obama  is going to bring in the right  to send dick pictures 
[04:09:00]  whilst driving.  Oh, wow.  You know what?  Obama 2012.  Obama 2012.  You just say an app  is on like iTunes  and all that.  Yeah,  download it.  It's free.  Derek is going to start  streaming in 2013  on Netflix.  It's the future.  It's the future.  That's very exciting.  Yeah,  and I heard they were going  to start doing comedy content.  I'm really happy  they're doing yours.  They're doing Derek  and the rest of development,  original programming.  That's awesome.  Well,  we're out.  We're done for the day.  Yeah.  Goodbye, everyone.  We'll see you guys tomorrow  and thank you, Ricky.  We love you.  Ricky,  thank you for staying around 
[04:09:30]  when not everybody would. </pre>
