<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Opie explaining Anthony's absence at a poker tournament, aiming for a World Series of Poker seat.  Studio guest Patrice O'Neal joined the discussion, which initially centered on poker, its skill versus luck component, and Opie's own disastrous virtual poker experience.  Patrice then recounted a frustrating incident involving his stolen and vandalized truck, detailing his dealings with the police and Geico.  He further discussed the high cost of living in his Manhattan building, including substantial maintenance fees and holiday tips.  The conversation shifted to Opie's recent wedding, with Patrice providing a humorous account of the diverse attire of guests, the varying moods of the white and Black gospel choirs, and the plentiful food and excellent band at the reception.  Opie then promoted Patrice's upcoming stand-up shows before moving to other segments.

The show continued with a discussion about the New York Jets' victory over the Buffalo Bills, focusing on a controversial touchdown by Sean Ellis, whose marijuana possession was highlighted.  The hosts then transitioned into a broader discussion about athletes, expressing disdain for many, particularly highlighting Terrell Owens, and engaging in racist jokes and off-color humor.  The conversation veered into movie crying scenes, interspersed with further offensive jokes, before concluding with a discussion about the shoe-throwing incident at a George W. Bush press conference.

The next segment began with a discussion of the shoe-throwing video, followed by a news story about a man murdering his former boss after being fired.  This led to a discussion of corporate greed, Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme, and recent firings at their radio station, including "The Grim Reaper."  Listener calls were taken, and the hosts promoted Jim Norton and Patrice O'Neal's stand-up gigs.  Audio from a previous Friday's segment where an intern was sent to a massage parlor ("Yankee Cranky shop") was played, alongside an anecdote from Jim Norton about Amsterdam.  The hosts then discussed an SNL skit about Governor David Paterson and their upcoming guests, Greg Gutfeld and a “Penthouse Pet of the Year,” Patrice O’Neal and Jim Norton were in studio for this segment.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on intern David's experience at a massage parlor.  Pre- and post-massage interviews and audio recordings detailed his naive expectations and the reality of the experience, including a "table shower," a handjob, and a surprisingly clinical recounting of the events.  The Emergency Alert System test interrupted the broadcast.  There was speculation about David's penis size, followed by a guest appearance by Taya Parker, Penthouse Pet of the Year.  She engaged in conversation about her work, comparing it to stripping, before the show concluded with plans for a live penis-size guessing game with interns.

Taya Parker, along with David, remained in studio.  The discussion centered on Taya's career, comparing her status to that of strippers, and her guaranteed pay. Her personal life, including her lack of a boyfriend, and her views on Playboy and Penthouse were also discussed.  A humorous and sexually explicit interaction ensued, with increasingly suggestive and vulgar banter, requests for Taya to undress, and detailed descriptions of sexual acts. Taya also discussed her musical and acting experiences.

The final segment continued the sexually explicit conversation with Taya Parker, featuring detailed descriptions of sexual acts, frequent use of racial slurs, and discussions about body image and racial stereotypes.  A caller inquired about Taya's anal sex experiences, leading to a discussion about her sexual history and preferences.  A prolonged, explicit role-playing phone sex scenario between Taya and David occurred, including detailed descriptions of various sexual acts.  Comments about Taya's appearance were made, and she was asked to kiss another guest, Lily.  Jimmy left the studio due to a legal matter, and the hosts promoted Ashley Madison and read explicit Post-it notes intended for Taya.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  It's a Monday.  Good morning. Welcome to the OPN...  Whoever I'm doing the show with today's show.  What happened with Anthony this time?  I still don't know what's going on. I don't really understand. 
[00:00:30]  He's in a tournament. He's possibly going to be in the...  He's trying to get into the World Series of Poker.  Yeah, I think.  The first I heard of this was kind of on Friday after the show.  I'm going down to Atlantic City to play poker.  And then as it developed over the weekend,  it was to get into the World Series of Poker or something like that.  Yeah, he won something a couple weeks ago that qualified him for this one.  And if he wins this one, he gets a seat at the World Series of Poker.  Right.  And as of 9.25 last night, he was still in the match or in the tournament, whatever it is. 
[00:01:00]  And he had knocked off or been part of knocking off several hundred people, I guess.  Really?  And he said it was him and a few pros left.  And that was it?  Yeah.  And if he won that table, what happens?  If he wins this event, he goes to the World Series.  I think he's down to probably just a few tables left.  Is he still playing?  Haven't heard since then, but I'll see if...  All I know is around 8, 8.30, we were scrambling to figure out who we're doing the show with today.  And we got the awesome Patrice O'Neal in studio today. 
[00:01:30]  What's up, Patrice?  That was a good buildup.  Nah, you got to tell the people what happened.  That's all.  Lie to him.  Oh, we were scrambling.  He got shot in the leg.  We were scrambling, but you were the first choice, but you weren't picking up.  He's spending the money he's supposed to be earning today.  That damn idiot.  World Series of Poker.  That tells you what it is.  Where is that?  He's like, World Series of Poker. 
[00:02:00]  Dude, you got to understand.  Yeah, no problem.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I'm just enjoying the ride.  It's the Opie and Gambly show.  You problem.  Yeah.  Anthony, what's your problems?  Gambling.  If he doesn't think he has a gambling problem, it's just sometimes you got to let somebody  just do what they do, man.  I got to do what I do.  Well, this isn't really gambling.  This is poker.  Well, it's gambling. 
[00:02:30]  Well, he would say it's not really gambling.  It's poker.  It's the cost of the money and he gets to lose.  Let me tell you how shaky of a gambler I am.  Yeah.  I bought my phone and it has already installed Texas Hold'em.  Oh, that's not good.  And I'm very careful with my fake phone money.  Yeah.  Really?  Fake BlackBerry phone.  It's like, and Texas Hold'em is interesting because you just start off with two cards and  you're just, you know, you get some jerk.  They have aggressive players and you just get some guy that just throws in all his money 
[00:03:00]  and it's just like, you know, you have, you got to guess.  Yeah.  It's just such a guess thing and you go on a thing.  I had one that had a million dollars and I just saw it disappear.  I was, it was stressing me out.  I was down to 400,000 and I desperately wanted to get back up to a million.  So, so I just was thinking, all right, I'm up 125,000.  You can feel why gambling is not good.  Can't you just reset the phone?  Yes.  That's what I'm saying.  That's what I'm saying. 
[00:03:30]  That's what I was, you can reset your money.  But I started off with $500 and went and built it up to a million dollars, man.  Nice.  Because I had a, you know, you get, you get two Kings or you get a, something with two  clubs and I get, you know, all that stuff, whatever, straights and, and, and not knowing  what's what, but it's just some of those other hands you get straight full house.  And I don't know what's what I know triples are good, but you don't even know what's  what and you're playing.  Well, I know it's this, I know it's, it's a pair. 
[00:04:00]  A pair.  That's a good start.  And no matter how high, you know, if you got a pair of Kings, a pair of Kings beat a pair  of Queens, whatever.  Okay.  Now, uh, thank God you're playing for fake money.  Triples are more than a pair, but it's more than something else.  More than two pairs too.  More than two pairs.  More than two pairs.  And triple.  And then after that is a full house and then a straight flushes too.  Then a flush is the same, uh, like all five, uh, clubs, clubs, clubs, clubs. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  And then there's the, the, the straight flush.  And then there's like a Royal flush, which is the biggie.  Isn't a full house though, higher than a straight.  I could be wrong.  Well, a full house is a triple and a pair.  Yeah.  Hey, you want to play for some real money, but I think here's my thing.  And, and, and, and this is what complete disrespect to poker players.  Yeah.  How, how awful you are.  It's a guesstimate.  I don't care about your poker hand or if you have blind guy eyeglasses or something and 
[00:05:00]  you just hide in your face.  It's a guess.  You're guessing that your hand is better.  If I got a pair of sevens and I get up three triple sevens, I have, I'm guessing you don't  have four.  So shut up.  It's an easy game.  If you're lucky.  A lot of the poker players would, would say completely wrong.  And there's a lot of strategy.  Yeah.  Whatever.  Convince me.  You know what I did roll poker.  I didn't like, I had like a bunch of Kings.  I had like four of them. 
[00:05:30]  It just, it looked redundant.  I'm like, this is bad.  There's too many of the same thing.  I need a little variety.  You have to have variety.  I wanted a couple of twos and maybe a seven.  You don't want to wear the same stuff every day.  You want a little variety.  It's just, I know I could get past a certain, if I get lucky cards, I know I could get past  board one.  Well, look, the phones are lit already.  Let's just acknowledge, because I know why they're calling.  Let's just acknowledge that Patrice might not be in the know as far as poker goes.  Opie.  There's a lot of strategy involved. 
[00:06:00]  Here's what I'm going to do, so I don't curse out some degenerates.  Yeah.  Just convince me that it takes strategy to understand whether or not I should go with  these three sevens.  Everybody's going to go with the three sevens, or three tens.  Everybody's going to go.  What if someone has three eights?  If they have three eights, whatever.  What if there's a pair that's being shown right now?  A higher pair than yours, and all you need is that other card in your hand.  Then you pray to God.  All right. 
[00:06:30]  And you hopefully, it will come up what you need, and if you don't, you gulp, and you  try to fake, and you bluff, blasey, blasey.  And how much are you down right now?  With your fake money on your blackberry?  With my fake money, I got up to a million with my fake money, and they start you off with  500, I got up to a million with my fake money, and then I went on a complete, and I started  losing, even when I started playing conservative, you still have an anti and an up, so I might  have two nines showing, and I get in there, and I go, okay, and then they bust out the 
[00:07:00]  way I have it.  I have the computer, not like a jerk dealer who just does what he does.  It just goes, blap, lays out what's next.  So I'm like, wow.  I'm really hoping about 40, and this ex-guy just went all in.  Oh, boy.  That could be a big bluff, or he might have something really nice.  God, I'm taking a chance.  I'm going for it.  Or I'm playing conservative, but if I play conservative, I still lost 32,000.  Well, you got to do a little of both. 
[00:07:30]  You got to know when to maybe do a little bluffing, depending on what cards are showing.  Which is a better song.  When you're hot, you're hot.  When you're not, you're not.  That's what cards is.  Stop with your skilled card level.  You know what I did wrong, and I didn't realize this, but I had two sevens.  So I was at a table, and I was like, well, does anybody have another seven?  I didn't realize.  Because if you don't, then I think I might have a shot at a third seven here.  I'll give you two for a seven if you have it.  That's like somebody who tells you the secret of playing slots. 
[00:08:00]  Shut up.  Yeah, pull slots.  Curse.  Cross your fingers, you jerk.  And if they're so great, why are they losers?  Someone's better than them.  It's just luck.  You walk through a casino, and you get that person that's been to a casino a little too  many times, and they go, you got to play the end slot machine.  That's the one that gets all the traffic, and they're ready to hit another jackpot.  Stop.  Stop, goofy guy from North Jersey. 
[00:08:30]  You're not in Ocean's 13.  Right.  You're not Brad Pitt just fixing it and stealing from Al Pacino.  You're just an ass.  The best is when card counting became huge for, you know, Blackjack, everyone would go  to a casino.  That book, that guy.  That guy from MIT.  Sure.  I read the book.  I saw the movie.  There's been a few things on, you know, counting.  And the casinos allow it because most people don't know what the F they're doing, and they  lose more money because they think they know how to count the cards. 
[00:09:00]  Because we asked the expert, like, yeah, we allow this to happen because most dummies  don't know what they're doing, and they're losing an S-load because they're betting a lot  more than they would have because they really think they know how to count cards for real.  I always thought if I had a superpower, I would just want x-ray vision to cheat at cards  just to be able to look for a card and go, okay, I know, I'm winning.  That's it.  Do you know how long into that you'd be annoyed that that was the one you chose?  It's like, you see people, Superman flying by, and you're yelling, go fish. 
[00:09:30]  You're like, this stinks.  Why did I take this one?  I don't know.  The x-ray thing's pretty cool, though.  Oh, x-ray vision is decent, man.  He wouldn't get any sleep, especially if you lived in one of these big buildings in Manhattan.  I just don't.  You'd be real tired.  Anthony missed his morning radio show.  There's a garbage man depending on him to come and wake him up, and he's gambling his zillions  away.  All right, he figures, you know, we got it under control, I guess.  He got it.  Whatever.  Go scramble and call one of those boobs.  They'll get in here. 
[00:10:00]  We literally were scrambling.  You finally called back at 9 o'clock last night.  Something like that.  You were the go-to guy, Patrice.  Well, I keep my phone off.  We went down the list.  I keep it off.  I just had a bad couple of months.  If I was deeply religious, I think the devil was chasing me.  What's wrong with you?  You know how you get like-  Ups and downs.  Boy, is it downs.  All right.  That means you're ready to go back up.  That's how life is.  I'm feeling okay, yeah.  I woke up this morning, silly string was sprayed all over my rental car.  Why? 
[00:10:30]  Just silly string.  Why?  So you feel just like they singled you out.  You got to explain why you have a rental car, though.  Yeah, I got my truck stolen.  You knew that, though.  Yeah, I was there.  The Monday before Thanksgiving, you know?  Mm-hmm.  But it was stolen.  Wait, I thought you meant it was stolen by people that were at your little party.  It was stolen for real.  I lost you on that story.  No, it was ripped off out in front of my garage.  Yeah, okay.  In the morning.  Like, I woke up.  It was Tuesday morning.  My mother had just come up.  I picked up.  It was two days after your wedding. 
[00:11:00]  Okay.  Two days.  So I'm going from your wedding home, went to Subway, hired some cleaning service to just  clean my house, and I let it go.  And then I parked at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and then the next day, my neighbor, one of my  neighbors who's in charge of the condo association, which is just, on my condo association checks,  I write something nasty every time on a memo, like, for what?  That's brilliant, actually. 
[00:11:30]  Like, why, I don't know, I'm writing you a check.  You do absolutely nothing.  Jimmy and I have to write those checks, too.  We live in separate buildings, but a very similar situation, and I'm with you.  I've drawn middle fingers.  I've drawn garbage day.  I just go, I don't know why I'm paying this money.  You know what I get for?  Brown water.  And they're telling me it's okay to drink.  Dude.  I've finally got to a point in my life I shouldn't be drinking brown water anymore.  That's a new pimping move, and I'm so not the person I used to be, because I have things 
[00:12:00]  in my life to lose.  Boy, once you've got things to lose, you just become a weak person.  And what I have to lose is I don't know what really is a consequence if I don't pay them,  because I...  Oh, you've got to pay.  Yeah, you have to.  I own my house, but what can they do?  They do nothing.  They figured out here in New York that if you buy one of these ridiculously overpriced apartments  that you'll never get your money back.  Because even if the economy just continues in Manhattan, the real estate market continues 
[00:12:30]  to go up, by the time you start figuring out the fees that you pay every month, you're  not getting that money back.  We got one of the...  I'm paying close to $50,000 a year.  In what?  In fees.  In fees.  Maintenance fees.  In...  Yeah!  Wait a minute.  $50,000 a year?  I do believe, right?  Not for me.  Look at Norton's guys.  It's got bigger than usual.  But that's a lot.  How much is that a month?  Let me think.  $5,000 a month more.  You know what?  I did the math.  Four? 
[00:13:00]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  No, it's over...  Okay, it's over $25,000.  Sorry.  I misrepresent.  But it is over $25,000.  That's still a lot of money.  I just did the math horribly wrong.  $25,000 a year.  Times 30 years, if you do the whole 30 years, which most of us won't do.  What do they really...  Okay, what do they...  That's $750,000, am I right?  What do they noticeably give you?  In a building, you get security.  I guess the difference is between a condo association and a building.  In a building, they'll have... 
[00:13:30]  It's called the White Glove Service.  It's almost like you're walking into a hotel every day, but it's like, who cares?  Wait, but okay.  I can open my own door.  What do you...  What do you...  Wait.  What do you go, all right, I get this.  I get...  I feel this, that I have, and I like to pay for it.  The building's clean.  I feel like it's a clean place to live.  They take care of everything.  I have security, which I like.  I don't...  Not just door guys, but actual security.  I wanted to live in a building that had actual security.  Yeah, security that bring your packages up.  When you pull up to the building after a long weekend, you got a lot of stuff. 
[00:14:00]  Parking in this, too?  Hell no.  That's another $400 a month I'm paying.  I'm paying another $400 a month for parking.  Cable?  Cable.  What?  I pay for my cable?  Yeah, you don't get cable.  What are you talking about?  What do you get that you like?  Little stuff like that.  If there's a problem in your building, like yesterday they called me, right?  They're like, somebody on the seventh floor...  Has a knife.  Yeah, exactly.  You have any butter?  They said, look, don't use your kitchen sink because this line... 
[00:14:30]  We have to shut this line down because somebody on the seventh floor, which is below  me, a couple floors below me, is having a problem with their water.  It's flooding.  Yeah.  So they had to shut it down and fix his thing.  But you have security in the building, so if something's going wrong with your apartment,  like if there's any kind of flooding or something like that...  24-hour security, people just walking through?  Yeah.  And you trust them?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  They have a system to get your key where you have a key, the concierge has a key, and  security has a key, but in order for them to pull your key, it's all on a computer.  So the guy at the front desk can't even take your key because it will register on the 
[00:15:00]  computer that he is the one who pulled it from the slot.  Yep.  So you can't get...  It's going to be very hard for anybody who works there to get into your apartment.  Yeah.  So you feel secure with your apartment.  Yeah, that's worth $750,000 over 30 years.  Oh!  And ready for this one?  I don't know what I really get because I...  You pay for another house for somebody to clean that building?  Well, that's if I stay there 30 years.  That's crazy.  But I'm...  I mean, I swear I'm just a kid from Long Island, so this stuff to me is like, I don't  care.  I don't need the white glove service.  I can open my own doors.  I can get my own packages from the mailroom. 
[00:15:30]  You know, it is nice, but is it worth that much money?  I don't think so.  I get nothing.  For yours, right?  And you get cursed out if you change...  Well...  If you put bars in your windows.  If you put dish-to-dish network.  Yeah, so that means you don't even own your own condo.  I don't own the outside of my house.  I own the inside.  Hold on.  And because it's Christmas time, it's worth mentioning, I just got the...  Oh, the list.  The list.  It's called The List.  Yeah.  What is that?  Ready for this?  Do you have it?  Oh, I thought you were... 
[00:16:00]  No, no, no.  I don't have it with me.  Oh, you reached to your right.  I'm like, did you bring it in?  No.  It's a list of everybody that works in the building, and there are people on there you've  never seen.  I think...  I have to ask Kenny, but I think it's close to 50 people.  At least 40.  And they all expect their holiday tip.  That would only cost me 50 bucks.  And they got...  Oh, yeah.  Here's your buck.  Really?  As they do what?  Let somebody break in your house?  Really?  Is that what...  And they got a big box.  As soon as you enter the building with a slot to put the Christmas tips, they all talk to 
[00:16:30]  each other.  They all know how much you're tipping.  And you get a list with their name, their picture, and what they do for the building.  So, realistically, a real happy Christmas for that building is going to cost you $2,500.  Because...  $2,500?  Because you got to pop...  You pop them all 50.  Get Kenny.  I think I went way higher than that.  More?  You pop them all 100? 
[00:17:00]  Not all 100.  Some, you got to go 100.  Kenny, how much did I spend on Christmas tips last year?  Because Kenny really helped me out with this.  You got to remember, this is the whole year.  How many guys did I have...  Kenny, focus.  How many guys did I have to tip last year?  You know about...  It's in the 40s.  All right.  And how much did it come out to?  Because we're in the middle of doing this now.  The lowest tip for the lowest guy on the totem pole is 75.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  For the whole year.  Well, this is...  So, I'm saying...  So, I'm doing pretty good. 
[00:17:30]  100 for everybody.  Look, this is...  That's the lowest tip?  Well, this is where...  Oh, God.  You lowball.  Sorry, guys.  Well, see, everyone thinks I'm like the stingy one.  But I'm also really stupid because what happened was I started too high.  Because now they're expecting at least that, if not more.  Because this is my second year in the building.  Second year for the holiday tips.  I was thinking...  I should have started low.  If you hit a blue-collar dude with $50 in his hand, that should be good enough. 
[00:18:00]  Some guys it is.  But then there's the guys that take...  You actually do.  When you walk in and out of the building all day, you really do get to know these guys.  If you want cabs, they'll get...  It's not...  Look, it's not major stuff they do.  Yeah, I like a bunch of them.  But you do get to know them.  They're nice dudes.  You feel like you got new friends and stuff.  It's an expense that if you want to...  It's an expense.  Like, it just comes to live in there.  I'm not a cheap dude, man.  But, dude...  Dude, you never...  You just don't get your money back if you buy a Manhattan.  I don't care what people say.  Well, how much did I pay last year, Kenny?  Do you know about...  It's in the thousands.  More than this? 
[00:18:30]  More than $4,000?  More than this?  How much?  Five?  Three-something.  Three-something.  I guess that.  Three-something.  Three Gs?  Three Gs every year.  That's how much you dropping?  No, because I have...  I think I tip less than he does.  Yeah, I think I tip less than I have.  My apartment's probably 20% of the size, so they get 20% of the tip.  Well, they also...  I'm like, go ahead, run around my apartment and then go run around his.  Well, the problem is, too, they know how big your apartment is.  They expect more.  It's a whole status thing.  I hate... 
[00:19:00]  I don't think I...  So they're leaving.  How many people in your building?  Oh, gee, we got to...  We got to take a break, bud.  Please, let me stay on this when we get back.  All right, and we've got to find out what happened to you.  Oh, Jesus.  I want to apologize to you, because I really thought I had black friends realize I did  not, and you were right, so I owe you an apology.  And I want to talk about football.  I want to thank you, too.  I want to thank you for that wedding, because I found out how sad white God is.  I didn't realize that.  Oh, please.  I did that for the older generation.  Trust me. 
[00:19:30]  Sometimes you got to...  God, white God, is sad.  Y'all should be happy as hell.  You got to pick your shots.  That one, I was like, all right, I'll do this for the older crowd, because that's not  my thing.  And I did get a lot of exercise, by the way.  All right, we'll talk about it.  We'll talk about the wedding.  We'll talk about sports.  We'll talk about Bush getting a shoe thrown at his head.  We'll talk about Avery being dumped.  We'll talk about Governor Patterson being pissed off at the SNL skit.  We got lots...  Being told he should be pissed off.  We got lots to do, so stay right there.  It's Opie and Jimmy and Patrice today. 
[00:20:00]  Let's call it that.  Opie, Jimmy, and Patrice.  There you go.  What's up, people?  Good morning.  Patrice didn't know this, but actually, like, you actually, like, a lot of people who live  in other places, when I'm using the bathroom, I actually do have one of those guys run up  with toilet paper on his hand and take care of things for me.  White Booth!  That's why they call it White Club Service.  White Booth!  Hey, Patrice, so I got to apologize to you for a couple things. 
[00:20:30]  The first, you're telling me how your car got stolen, but somewhere, because it's early  in the morning and I'm just having my coffee, you said you were having some kind of family  thing for Thanksgiving, and then your car got stolen, so I thought that they were playing  some kind of prank on you, so I'm laughing at you.  No, my car...  Sunday...  Actually got stolen.  Sunday night at some point, it was parked in my...  It's too big to fit in my garage.  It was stolen from in front of my garage, where it was parked, in my driveway, and I... 
[00:21:00]  Don't you got an alarm system and all that?  They knew how to...  Factory.  Factory.  And they knew...  They knew what they were doing.  It's...  It's...  They're not dummies.  I mean, they quietly stole my truck, but here's the thing.  They didn't officially steal it.  This is all stuff I learned as I'm...  As I'm...  As at the same time, and you know, I'm sitting at my...  Sitting to myself, you know, how much people are against other people?  This is what it boiled down to. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  So, my neighbor knocks on my door.  This guy knocks on my door.  He's knocking on my door in the morning.  I come down.  I'm looking at him.  I said, why are you knocking on my door like a cop in the morning?  Because he's the head.  The guy happens to be the head of the condo association.  So, I thought he was going to be calling me saying, hey, dude, you can't be sending,  you know, nasty memos and checks.  Right.  But he's like, dude, he stepped to the left.  I'm looking at him.  He's a big dude.  He's like a white me.  So, I'm looking at him, and he slides to the left and looks behind him. 
[00:22:00]  There's my truck.  He was blocking your view?  Until he stepped aside.  Whoever stole it, they took my truck from in the back where it was parked and pushed it  to the front.  So, you were in the house when they...  In the house.  I guess it had to be about...  I don't know.  In the morning, I went over and I looked, and I just smiled.  Like, because I go, if I have the reaction I think I'm supposed to have, I might die. 
[00:22:30]  Like, I might pass out and die.  Sure.  So, I just went, ah.  And my mother was visiting, and she was sleeping in the room above the garage.  Like, the way the house is built, my other room, I got two bedrooms, and the other room  is over the garage.  Yeah.  And I go, moms, did you...  You want to kill your mom, don't you?  Did you hear any...  Nah.  Just keep that car running in the garage.  Did you hear any...  Did you hear any...  No.  No?  No, no.  Slept like a baby?  I saw you and your friends pushing the truck. 
[00:23:00]  I was going to say something.  My mother...  So, I'm like, I'm just, okay.  I tell my girl, and my girl flips out, because she's already very paranoid.  She's just paranoid.  And she believes in the secret, so this is all...  See?  The other day, we was talking about evil frisbees, and look what happened.  Like, shut up.  But...  So, what did they do to your car?  Get to the point of it.  I'm getting to it.  All right.  Sorry.  So, anyway, I'm talking to her, but it is a secret. 
[00:23:30]  So, I'm trying to keep it from being magical.  That's what I...  But that started off thinking the devil was after me.  Right.  So, I tried to keep it from being magical.  So, I walk over.  I put my coat on.  I stroll over.  First thing I did was call 9-1-1.  Ready, everybody?  Don't call 9-1-1 if something like that happens to you.  No, they're not happy to do it.  She cursed me out for 15 minutes to tell me, don't waste their time calling 9-1-1.  Call the non-emergency number.  I said, who needs a cop without an emergency? 
[00:24:00]  I almost cursed her out to send a cop.  Like, I wanted to call a dumb whatever to send a cop.  But, ultimately, I knew a cop, and I called him.  I go, here's what I shouldn't have did.  It wasn't stolen.  This is what I had to...  As I was going to find out, it was recovered.  So, it was moved from where it was to another place.  It's called malicious vandalism because they found it. 
[00:24:30]  I'm outside.  It's up on bricks.  Wait a minute.  So, if a cop would have pulled that guy over driving, you could say, I'm not stealing it?  I'm moving it?  If they saw them doing what they were doing, it had to be in Lightspeed.  It was shocking.  And I'm glad I didn't wake up because I'm up at that time.  At whatever time they could have stole it, I'm up.  You wouldn't have ran outside.  You would have just watched them steal your car.  You would have just got to yell out the window, they'll leave.  You know what?  Most of us would just watch them steal it. 
[00:25:00]  No, you yell.  Your gut is like, yo!  Yo!  But, the brazenness of it, I would have got a nice bullet to the face.  So, I'm glad I didn't wake up.  But, it's up on bricks.  And, I'm just standing there looking up on bricks.  Two bricks.  And, I called my friend.  He said, call anonymous.  I called the number.  They sent the cop.  He couldn't report it stolen.  So, he had to report it.  Right, right, right, right.  So, I'm looking at it. 
[00:25:30]  I saw how they did it.  What they did, they took.  This is factory alarm.  They took the stupid thing off.  They took the handle of the truck off to disconnect the alarm.  Because, evidently, what they had to do was come and hit my car a couple of times to see if I had a decent alarm on.  Boom, boom.  They knew it was whack.  There's two kind of alarms you can have.  Perimeter or a shock.  If they break the window, it goes off.  Or, if they get near it, it goes off.  Sure, sure.  I had neither one.  All I have is an immobilizer, which keeps you from driving it. 
[00:26:00]  Or a low jack, which finds it if they steal it.  But, it doesn't prevent anything.  Right, right.  Your alarm stinks.  What does it?  Shoot, die on their hands like a bank robbery?  Dude, GMC.  Good luck to you going out of business.  Because, I don't know what alarm you're putting in, but you have to be saving money on that in the bailouts.  It's a kitchen timer.  They laughed at your alarm, huh?  Dude, you can see the smile they carved in the face.  Because, you can see where they put the screwdriver. 
[00:26:30]  Because, the cop starts laughing because he goes, oh, man, they got me twice.  The cop got me from the area.  So, he smashed.  They put a screwdriver, smashed the window.  And, as soon as you smash it, the whole thing cracks.  Yeah, I know.  So, you can just push it in.  Yeah.  So, now, they did the alarm.  They cracked the starter and put it in neutral and pushed it from where it was to 100 feet away.  100 feet away.  And, this is what people kept doing as they're driving by. 
[00:27:00]  People just, in the morning, just getting a nice morning talk.  Sure.  And, people know me.  Like, but, Trace!  Yeah, I'm sitting there going, I don't want people to know I live here.  Patrice!  Oh!  What, you have rims?  Kept asking.  Rims?  I get, no.  So, they pushed it off.  It was factory rims on my truck.  So, they pushed it 100 feet away.  100 feet.  And, then, they put it up on blocks.  Put it on blocks.  And, took your wheels?  And, took my factory rims.  Factory rims. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, they just went with the rims?  So, why did they have to put it on blocks for that?  They took the wheel.  They took everything.  That's what I asked.  That's what I'm saying.  Okay, they took all four wheels.  They obviously thought you were a white guy.  They had no idea.  They probably couldn't.  When they saw those tapes, they're like, this, he had factory rims.  Who is this guy?  They're sitting there with my tapes, too.  They know it's me.  They know who it is.  I'm sleeping with a box cutter in my bed.  Right.  You know.  But, ultimately, so, I'm sitting there.  And, they, the tow truck comes.  They don't have any recourse but to pull it on the tow truck with no wheels. 
[00:28:00]  Right.  So, I'm watching fire shoot from the bottom of my truck.  Yeah, the spark.  Of that pulling my wheel-less carcass of a truck up on a flatbed axe.  Like a snake skin.  That's a snake.  And I'm sitting there going.  And the cop, the cop was a cool dude.  He's like, ah, they got your rotors.  I'm like, what?  He just said to me.  He goes, man, they got me.  I put two boots into this.  Yeah.  So, ultimately, the thing that.  You got to think they have a better way to do that. 
[00:28:30]  But, ah, they don't want to be bothered.  Dude.  Get four crap tires and just roll them on.  They could have did that.  But, it wasn't.  That wasn't going to happen, of course.  Right, right.  Sure.  Now, this happened the Monday before Thanksgiving.  Mind you.  I still don't have my truck.  They had to do.  They had to find out because I called Geico.  And, this is what I mean about, you know, just what people are going to do.  If you ever get insurance.  If you buy a new car, one thing you better do is buy gap insurance.  I didn't know what gap insurance is.  It's the money that is between what you owe on your truck and what your truck is worth on the market. 
[00:29:00]  So, if you owe $30,000, your truck could be worth $15,000.  Right.  So, even if it's totaled or whatever, you owe $15,000.  Okay.  So, when I called Geico, they said, okay, look through the thing first.  Before they say, oh, Patrice, this is terrible.  They go, do you have comprehensive insurance?  I go, I'm sorry, what is that?  Yeah, I don't know.  That is, if you get your car stolen, there's a special insurance you have to have.  There's collision and then there's comprehensive. 
[00:29:30]  I happen to have it, but I asked the lady, because I was starting to become a crusader,  if I didn't have it, what would happen?  What would happen?  Eh, we wouldn't have given you no money.  I go, that's your job to say that?  Yeah.  That's your job to tell me that I was just tough luck?  And most people don't know that.  They're just like, yeah.  Nobody knows that.  You just want to get your car insurance thing over with.  You get the guy on the phone like, yes, yes, I guess, I guess, yeah, yeah.  Okay, how much a month?  So, for two weeks, I've been trying to prove that I didn't steal my own truck. 
[00:30:00]  Seriously?  Yeah, I had to get a police report.  I had to give a 15-minute interview.  They asked me what my, and I had to stop them then.  What was your motive?  What, wait, how much did you get for it?  Yeah, how much did you get for it?  What do you think we're rookies?  How much did you owe?  Yeah.  Are you late with any bills?  Yeah.  Are you late with your mortgage?  How much is your mortgage?  How much is your life? 
[00:30:30]  What do you spend a month?  What do you...  Get out of here.  You think I'm lying?  I don't think you're lying.  I just said get out of here.  And so they asked, exactly.  And that's what I ended up saying.  Like, look, I'm not telling you what I pay a month.  I hope there's a...  But they had to prove for about a week and a half, two weeks, that I didn't steal it.  Then they sent an adjuster out to tell me that they, down to the penny, that, you know,  it's going to cost, you know, something, something, something, thousand and two cents,  and I'm not going to get a penny more.  And I said, can you at least give me enough to get an alarm? 
[00:31:00]  Can you throw in a couple tires at least?  Something?  Can you do something?  Throw in a better alarm system?  So, ultimately, I guess I ended up proving I didn't steal it, and now it's still...  Now it's getting worked on.  I still don't have a truck.  Oh, so it was all before they did anything.  Because I got a call...  Before they did anything.  When I got there, I think it was Patrice or his girl said that our truck got stolen,  or his truck got stolen, but I had my Bose headphones and...  They didn't steal...  Patrice and his girl drove me home from Opie's wedding. 
[00:31:30]  And by the way, I know one thing they didn't steal out of this truck.  Easy pass.  I would never ride with that bum again.  I thought I was the last guy to get easy pass.  What are you doing with all the driving you do?  All the comedy clubs on the East Coast.  I just wait.  I read a...  Oh, my God.  I know why.  A guy got divorced.  And it's not...  We did the story.  You did that, so it is what it is.  That tells you something.  They used his easy pass to help out the divorce.  Sure.  And they also send you tickets if you go... 
[00:32:00]  No, they don't.  It never happens.  They haven't done that yet.  It never happens.  It's evil.  It never happens.  It is kind of evil, but man, is it convenient.  If they really wanted to, they could just take a picture.  They don't do that.  I've never got a ticket.  But it was kind of fun driving again in 1988.  Yeah.  Him and his chick coming back up.  We're fighting traffic.  You've never seen the easy pass lanes.  Yeah.  It looked like the third runway at Newark Airport.  There was nobody on there.  There were guys having a catch without their football.  It was so irritating.  Wasn't it fun?  Didn't it take you back?  Hell no.  It was awful.  And some of those roads from Philly to New York, you don't even have to go through an 
[00:32:30]  actual old booth.  You just continue on the highway at 70 miles an hour.  I'll tell you, this treating Kenny bad piece of garbage over here, there was a couple of  pauses when I dropped him in front of his home.  Right.  I drove past my house to get to this piece of garbage house, and it was a beat where he  waited to see me help him with his bags.  Almost spit right on his dumb suitcase.  Look, it's not that.  It's just almost like I want to give him the full story. 
[00:33:00]  Like, yeah, I got to drop Jim off.  Yeah, sure.  And I figured you wanted to help me with the bags.  Why not?  Big man.  The guy almost kicked him.  Luckily, it was cold, and his worm was...  You've got to get the easy pass, McTree.  I refuse.  You've got to get the easy pass.  There was four thugs in a car ahead of us, and this fat girl got out, and I guess they  bumped her car, and she got out to yell, and then saw that there were like four gangbangers.  That they beat fat black girls up for a living, and she got right back in there.  She got right back in and kept...  It was just kind of fun to watch.  Wasn't it fun, though?  Come on, Jim.  To watch. 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  As I was zipping by the easy pass, it would have been wonderful.  But to be there, I literally couldn't have felt worse if we were like in a stagecoach  with a horse pulling me.  There was no reason.  It's a comfortable truck, though, right?  It's great.  You was.  You was happy?  Yeah.  I don't know how it is.  It's like two and a half feet tire length lower.  I only got the easy pass maybe like two years ago, and when I finally got it, I'm like,  why didn't I get this earlier?  It's a trick.  And ultimately, here's what the toll people are going to do.  Get fired, because they're automating everything.  Get fired, and then all the easy pass lanes. 
[00:34:00]  It's not like you can go 60 miles an hour through it.  Something's going to break down with that system.  No, some of them you can.  That's what I'm saying.  They're building them now where it's way above the highway, and you just keep on zipping.  Yeah.  You don't stop at a toll.  It's two lanes.  It's also a way for them to raise tolls without you complaining, because you don't see it coming  off.  It comes with your credit card.  Yeah.  But Atlantic City has the actual highway, like you said, it's above the highway.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  They're making more and more of those to make it even more convenient.  But they didn't steal my Bose headphones. 
[00:34:30]  I had my Bose headphones and my iPod in the truck with Patrice, and I got it.  And his girl, I put everything in a big garbage bag, and I went to Patrice's for Thanksgiving.  How lucky is he?  And my headphones and my iPod were still there.  Did you enjoy yourself?  I did, actually.  It was great food, and I know Patrice's mother, and I met his family.  I've never met your mom.  I think it was too many middles there for Jim.  Too many what?  He has the worst comedian friends.  Oh, really?  Oh, middles.  Nobody you'd ever recognize from television, ever. 
[00:35:00]  Jim was the biggest artist, sitting uncomfortable, texting people on Thanksgiving.  Do you know?  It's just like when Frank got together with the boys, right?  Yeah.  And they were just sitting around him, just happy to be around Jim.  It was like the Rat Pack, literally.  They were all like little rodents.  It was the worst collection of comedians.  And Keith was supposed to come, but he didn't come.  No, he went to Wanda's house.  You got better dealed.  I don't think he went to Wanda's.  Did he say he went to Wanda's?  I think he stopped off there.  You got better dealed.  That piece of garbage.  You got better dealed for Wanda. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, wow.  There you go.  And then I went and saw Stupid Bob and his chick on the way back into...  I got to apologize to Patrice.  I invited Patrice to my wedding.  And you've been on the show a million times.  We do the black-white thing, black-white thing, and blah, blah, blah.  You guys don't have black friends.  I'm like, I ain't got black friends.  And I was insulted when you said you don't have black friends.  And then I'm at the wedding, and I stood up to look around the room and realized I don't have black friends.  You were the only black couple that I invited to the wedding. 
[00:36:00]  Well, it's an interesting wedding.  I mean, there's some personal things we said about it.  I'll share it with you.  One is when you said black tie optional, we didn't know it was an option to wear a sweatsuit.  Hey, you look sharp, though.  Your lady looked all right.  My girl planned her look since the wedding.  She's like, I don't want to embarrass anybody.  She looked ridiculous.  In front of us was a guy with those satin Philadelphia Eagles jackets.  I said, what is this? 
[00:36:30]  Somebody that won tickets from the Opie and Anthony show?  It was awful, some of the people.  I was like, I can't bless her, sweetie.  No problem.  We had everything from sweats to people dressed to the nines.  To tuxes.  And everything in between.  Unbelievable.  And then...  But really fast, because, I mean, the listeners understand this, because you've been listening long enough.  But the seating chart for the wedding, we did it the last minute.  Most people do that two or three weeks, you know, before the wedding.  So we're scrambling before, you know, the party started to still figure out who's sitting with who. 
[00:37:00]  And then we got into the big room and we stood up to look around like, all right, did we do a good job?  And I looked behind me and it was the comedian's table.  It was you.  It was Jimmy.  It was Rich Voss.  Who else was there?  Tyson Walter.  Tyson Walter.  And then there was this couple there.  The big football player.  Yeah, the football player.  Yeah.  I think he's retiring, unfortunately.  He might be.  Yeah, he had an injury.  Good friend of ours.  And then there was this couple that's really good friends with my girl's parents. 
[00:37:30]  Standing there, sitting there, scared out of their minds.  And looking straight ahead like, what did we do to deserve this table?  They were out of their minds scared.  They looked like.  And made us laugh so freaking hard.  They looked like Robert Duvall.  Like they would have been friends with Robert Duvall and his wife and the great Santini.  Yeah.  Like that's what they looked like.  Like older, middle class people.  Yeah.  Maybe a retired military guy.  Nice people.  Sitting with the comedians.  And Patrice was telling me before the show, you guys are talking about threesomes.  Oh, we was.  And swinging and this and that. 
[00:38:00]  My girl and Bonnie was talking, just comparing whose boyfriend was better and worse.  I mean, a man, you know, and then just sitting there talking.  And I mean, you know, we don't go out much.  We had a good time.  I had a good time.  Even like if I say, oh, the sweatsuit thing, it's just, it was just a good time to just be  able to even see that.  Because trashing something is a part of the good time.  Of course it is.  It's all good.  I don't care.  I had a great time, man.  It was well done.  The Ritz thing was beautiful. 
[00:38:30]  I mean, we had a good time.  And ultimately, the funniest part was the church.  It's just being at the church, the exercise that you get at a Catholic thing.  Up and down, up and down, up and down.  The sadness of white God is just shocking.  I can't argue with it.  I'm looking around the church and it's just constant pictures of Jesus being punched in  his stomach, set on fire, noogies.  It's just pictures I didn't even realize.  Was that the first time you were in a white church in a while? 
[00:39:00]  In a while?  Ever?  I felt like Al Pacino from when he played the devil.  I just, I felt aching.  And then...  I can't disagree.  That's one reason why I'm not a big organized religion guy.  The suffering, the sadness.  I just, stand up again.  I'm like, I just wanted to go, when are you getting married?  Yeah.  And then, thank you for what you did.  You had two, you know, you had a black choir.  Mm-hmm.  And a white choir.  You know how much that cost to get that done?  Dude, whatever it did, I appreciate it was for us. 
[00:39:30]  Well, know what I learned?  Like, that was my girl's touch.  She's like, we're going to liven this thing up.  So, she got a gospel choir.  Why is black God so happy?  And they were, and they, it was like Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act.  Dude, we had a black choir.  It's just like, you know, Lord Jesus is in the world.  And it's boo-da-dee-da-doo.  Yeah.  And the white choir, you had to have it, because, and don't think I wasn't watching.  As I'm looking at the black choir, I go, diddly-doo.  There's white, pure Catholics that knew all the stuff, went up at the top, and did the, 
[00:40:00]  they were looking like, mm.  Oh, yeah, they weren't happy.  The older generation wasn't happy.  You could feel it.  And then, as they sang the theme song from the game, Hitman,  and I'm just like, what is Caesar getting beat up right with?  What's going on?  Let me jump in for a second, though.  I mean, we suggested that we wanted this, like, gospel choir,  and we wanted the black ladies singing their, you know, their, you know, what's off. 
[00:40:30]  And the guy who runs the church, he's like, hell no, without saying hell.  He's like, no, that ain't happening.  And then we started with the negotiations.  Well, would it happen for this much?  Would it happen for this much?  And you realize.  God has a price.  You realize that, yeah, you could get anything done in a Catholic church if you have the money to do it.  God has a price.  So, I mean, when people were walking into the church, there was a concert going on.  It was like, happy days are here.  And it was like, it was all like New Orleans type stuff going on. 
[00:41:00]  Right?  Like a scene from Live or Let Die.  Right.  Live or Let Die.  Just like die, die, die, die, die.  And I'm looking up there, and you can see, and they had a Philly, it was a Philly choir.  Yeah.  Because all the dudes had the big, giant Philly beards.  Oh, yeah.  Philly beards.  The big Philly beards.  They all look like Meldrick Taylor now.  You know, big, fat black girls.  Oh, yeah.  Just, it was a black choir.  Oh, yeah, it was.  Nice touch.  And then the white choir does it, and I just was like, the sadness. 
[00:41:30]  But, I mean, let me tell you, we had a great time, man.  The food was good.  The before reception food, unbelievable.  Sushi and everything.  The reception food was good.  The idea, I got a new appreciation for everything, money, and the fact that there was, if you  hire a wedding band, that they have to perform all night, and it's very choreographed, and  it's a hard, you know, I have a new respect, even though, we have a new respect for a wedding 
[00:42:00]  band.  They were great.  Everyone's raving about that band.  They were unbelievable.  They kept, they had to park, and then while people are doing nice stuff, like quiet stuff,  there's a guy up there just going, you know, the Lord lift us away, we belong.  Just quiet in the back, knowing what they're doing.  It was, it was, it was, I mean, I'm getting married at the, you know, at the Elvis Chapel  or the James Brown Chapel in Vegas.  It's a fact.  I looked at, money or not, but I don't, it costs a lot.  I looked at someone, I go, wow, this is a great wedding, and someone goes, it's your 
[00:42:30]  wedding, idiot.  I got lost in the fact, I'm like, oh yeah, it's my wedding.  And you didn't pay for it, right?  Her dad paid for everything, right?  Yeah, you know, we did a little something, something.  But that's, wow, that's how it's supposed to be, though, right?  Her father?  They definitely paid more than their share.  Let's just put it that way, yeah.  All right.  At one point, I'm hearing, and I'm not a big Cine Lopper fan, but I'm hearing Time After Time.  Is that the name of the song?  Yeah.  Yeah, and we're eating our purple potatoes, and Peruvian potatoes or something, I don't 
[00:43:00]  know.  The staff, by the way, had the people who served the food, had the personality of his  insurance.  Oh, really?  Oh.  Terrible.  Excuse me, can I have some milk, sir?  Shut up.  I'm a big fan of the remake.  I like when someone else tries to do a very popular song, and I'm hearing Time After Time,  and I'm thinking to myself, I'm not a big Cine Lopper fan, but this dude is doing a really  good job with this song, meaning this dude on a CD.  I figured the band put a CD on so we could eat dinner.  Oh, it was just the guy that was just standing up there. 
[00:43:30]  So I'm like, wow, I got to go up to the band and find out who does this so I can maybe,  you know, get it for my iPod or something, right?  I look up, and it's the black dude singing Time After Time.  I'm like, you've got to be kidding me.  It was so well choreographed.  Whatever music you needed, somebody would be singing the music you needed for the time  that you needed it.  The big everybody dance music, the toast music.  It was, well, I'll tell you this much.  I mean, for the people getting married out there, just spend all your money on a band, 
[00:44:00]  a real effing band.  It makes the whole wedding.  Go to Vegas, and then enjoy everything.  I'm just saying, if you're going to have one of these traditional weddings, make sure  you get a real effing band that knows what they're doing.  Let me ask one actual price from you.  One price.  How much to rent the hall at the hotel?  Just the hall.  There's your answer.  More than $1,000?  Perhaps more than that.  And how long do you get it from what to what?  What do you mean? 
[00:44:30]  Well, we went with an after-hours wedding party thing, which I don't think the Ritz has  ever done before.  So the wedding ended, and then we went into after-hours mode, where they brought out the  cheesesteaks.  Were you there for the cheesesteaks?  Oh, you missed the cheesesteaks.  And then we break it down.  The band leaves, and then now it's a DJ.  Like you're in one of these crazy clubs.  What time did you go to?  I don't know.  Like one?  I couldn't have cheesesteaks.  I literally ate until I had to sit on the toilet and eat and make room at the same  time.  I could not shove another bite of food in my fat face. 
[00:45:00]  I did not stop eating for hours.  Yeah, there was plenty of food, man.  They brought out the cheesesteaks.  I wish I could have said I snuck out, but it was like, wait a minute.  All the black people.  Where did black people go?  I was black people.  That's where this started.  I realized that I don't have black friends.  You were it.  You were it.  But I really thought I had more black friends.  You thought you did?  I really did.  What does that even mean?  I don't know.  What does that even mean? 
[00:45:30]  When you go, you don't have black friends.  I'm like, yeah, I do.  Yeah.  And now I finally have officially realized I did not.  And if you thought you had black friends, right?  If you thought you had black friends, what do you do?  Well, because they were just playing it with my friends.  What kind of friend are you where you're not sure?  Because I don't.  You just found out you had black friends.  How about this?  I don't know how many Jewish friends I have.  You're just friends.  Why don't you call your friends?  Stop using that term loosely.  Call?  Call them just some folks.  Some folks?  I don't have any black folks in my life.  Any black folks just hanging around?  I don't know.  Friends are friends. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know which ones are black, which ones are Jewish.  Who do you call every night?  Who do you say hi to?  White people.  White people.  We got to take a break.  We had each other.  Quick thing.  I'll be at the Borgata Atlantic City January 16th, 17th.  One night is sold out.  One night has some tickets left.  So figure it out yourself.  TheBorgata.com.  And I guess we'll be back.  We haven't done any new stuff yet.  Yeah, we're definitely going to talk football when we get back a little bit.  We're going to talk Sean Avery.  We're going to talk some baseball.  I could have went to Dallas.  I went to that game last night.  All that stuff.  All right.  And sent a box, but I didn't because I had to be here.  And then we got Bush getting shoes thrown at him. 
[00:46:30]  He's got good reflexes, though.  He certainly does.  I'm very impressed by his reflexes.  You could have went to the Dallas game.  I could have went to that on the Monday Night Football game.  All right.  Opie and Anthony sends Anthony today.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  We got Patrice O'Neal in studio today.  Good morning.  How are you?  Let's talk a little football.  I'm not feeling good about my Jets, I got to tell you.  I know they had a big win over the Bills yesterday.  But Brett Favre isn't impressing me. 
[00:47:00]  And this is where he's got to step up.  But I don't think he's got it.  He's 40 years old.  I understand that.  I'm getting a little nervous here.  Everyone is excited today because a big win over the Bills.  But the Bills suck.  A 40-year-old Brett is better than the – they haven't had a good quarterback there since Joe Namath.  Well, you've got the Chad Pennington thing.  He's winning games for Miami.  Who, rub arms?  He doesn't have much of an arm.  Chad stinks.  But he's getting the job done down there in Miami.  He's not getting the job done. 
[00:47:30]  That defense and that those trick plays and all that stuff, they're doing okay.  Yeah, they play a little old-school football down there.  He's trying to win.  That's what Miami's trying to do.  Trying to win.  And it sucks.  Sean Ellis had the fumble recovery and ran in.  Oh!  Ran in.  The 11 yards.  I'm amazed he made that play.  And look what he gets on the sports page today.  Pot luck because he was busted for pot November 29th.  So, yeah.  See, they still played him out, huh?  Huh?  They still played him out.  Yeah, there you go. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, that's why the media.  No one wants to talk to him.  Pot luck.  Ellis' return helps Jets smoke bills.  See, they have to do that.  Pot luck in a country where it's almost completely legal.  Yeah, exactly.  Thanks.  Who gives a crap about people smoking the pot at this point?  Thank you.  Thank you for the fairness paper.  I asked you just before we went live if you saw the end of the Jet game because I did not.  Oh, yeah.  They just – he scrambled.  No, I saw the big play.  You see him knock over the ref?  Face planting down to the turf? 
[00:48:30]  Oh, man.  Did that look delicious?  Can I see it?  Oh, my God.  You've got to check out the video.  I hope it was an old 60-year-old one, too.  I don't know the defenseman that was trying to make the play and pushed him – it looked  like he pushed him out of bounds just at the last second.  But Ellis was able to tiptoe into the end zone.  But the guy that knocked him at the last second knocked over the ref to try to get on the play  because the ref was in the way.  So he said, screw this.  I'll take my chances with the league and just knocked him from behind. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, yeah, but he should have been able to do that, though.  I think he should be able to.  I'm sure Roger Goodell will find a reason to end his whole career.  He sickens me.  Yeah, especially if you're – yeah, you're making – this is the game-winning play.  You're in the way.  You're in the way.  So you should be able to do whatever the hell you want.  I'm with you.  But they're saying there might be a big fine or a suspension for the guy.  And the ref don't know his name either.  I didn't do my research, whatever.  Some white dude.  He's bleeding like crazy because he face-planted onto the turf.  If he's a man's man, he would have gone, hey, dude, this is football.  If he was a football guy, he would go – 
[00:49:30]  He seemed pretty cool with it.  But the announcers were basically saying, I don't know what the league's going to think about this one.  It was the Bills' center, Duke Triplett.  Duke, all right, right, okay.  And he actually went into the locker room after the game and apologized to the ref.  And the ref made a point of coming out and telling everybody this was a class move.  Okay.  He's a good guy.  It wasn't malicious.  The guy just wanted to get to the play.  Move, you idiot.  Move out of the way.  This is not your game.  This is my game.  But I made a rookie mistake with the DVR. 
[00:50:00]  It was a really nice day in New York, and we still haven't gotten a Christmas tree.  So I'm like, you know what?  This is what I'm going to do.  Jets-Bills game, really good game.  I'm going to push record.  I'm going to go get my damn tree.  I'm going to walk around a little bit.  I'm going to come home.  No one's going to tell me who won the game, and I'm going to make believe it's still live.  We've all done that, right?  The tree thing?  No.  Go ahead.  Keep going, pagan, about your tree.  Makes the apartment smell nice.  That was a good fart. 
[00:50:30]  100 beans for a tree in New York.  What did you get, the size down from Rockefeller Center?  No, not really.  You supposed to get a tree for $2.99.  Honestly?  What's the matter with you?  Honestly, it's like six and a half, maybe.  And a big white angel at the top.  Have your black maid put it up there.  I don't have a black maid.  Go warm up to bed and then put your giant angel up there.  I think I got a Hispanic maid.  I don't have a black one.  A big, some Puerto Rican.  Mr. Hughes? 
[00:51:00]  Right.  Mr. Hughes?  Can I put a...  Oh, no, no.  We went...  Angel as big as a Puerto Rican.  All I'll say is I went safe Hispanic.  You can go Hispanic or you can go safe Hispanic.  And that's all I'm going to say.  And I'm not going to say who's the safe Hispanic or the hardcore Hispanic.  Well, safe for that?  Hispanic.  Huh?  I'm not even going to say because you don't know what you're allowed to say on the radio  anymore.  But there is something you do.  There's Hispanics and then there's safe Hispanics.  We had...  Not those new ones, those Hondurans. 
[00:51:30]  Not the apocalypto ones.  Dude, we had Hispanic.  We had Hispanic, gave her a check.  She came back two days later, knocked on our door.  They let her up, by the way, Jimmy.  And sprayed some type of snake blood in your face.  She said, I don't want to check any cash because she had something going on.  I don't know if it was a divorce or something.  And she insisted that we pay her in cash.  And we're like, whoa, we're going safe Hispanic.  That was it.  That was it for her.  I'm like, there's something not right about this one.  Let's go safe.  She doesn't have... 
[00:52:00]  She doesn't have...  She's illegally here.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  It was an uptown Hispanic.  I'm telling you, there's differences.  I just don't want to...  Was she Puerto Rican?  Well, she was Puerto Rican.  She's automatically legal.  Yeah, she was legal.  She was totally legal.  She had something going on.  I think she was hiding money from her boyfriend or her husband or something.  I have a housekeeper, same thing.  I think they come once every two weeks or whatever because I won't clean ever.  And the check I was writing or something like that to cash.  They always wanted to cash. 
[00:52:30]  And then she's like, no, could you do something else because my bank wouldn't take it.  It looked kind of weird.  So I started going with cash.  And she also asked...  How about never coming to my house again, doesn't have a bank account?  That means I can't find you if something happens.  What's going to happen?  Who the hell knows, Mr. Comfortable?  Same thing with EasyPass.  You've got to be uncomfortable with somebody that doesn't want to take a check.  What?  I don't want uncomfortable in my home.  Exactly.  I'm fine with her.  She's nice.  Right.  The other thing, she asked for... 
[00:53:00]  Every surveillance camera murder, the dude is nice as he's walking in the door.  Yeah.  How are you, sir?  Blah, blah.  Right to the chops.  That lady...  She also sat down and go, can you make me a cup of tea?  She was pretty brazen.  Did she really?  Oh, yeah.  She put her feet up on herself?  Just a brazen mate.  And all of a sudden, we get up awkwardly, like, we're making tea for her.  And why is she in our house?  And why is she demanding cash?  I'm like, you've got to go.  And your mom is like, don't just make her tea.  I was ready to roll.  It's not Duke Triplet, by the way. 
[00:53:30]  It was Duke Preston.  People are making fun of you at Stump Prank.  So here's my rookie mistake with the DVR.  So I push record.  I do everything perfect.  I get the treat back to the house.  I avoid the score.  I sit down.  I even have my girl going to the apartment first, just in case the 4 o'clock game has  the Jets score.  I'm like, can you, you know, get this game where it was?  She pushes play, and I walk in, like, the game's still going on, and I sit down, right?  I see the Amazing L's play, and then with 40, less than a minute, somewhere, whatever, 
[00:54:00]  like it matters, but it was less than a minute left in the game, all of a sudden, it freezes  and says, do you want to say program?  I'm like, you've got to be effing kidding me.  I didn't get to see the Bills' last attempt, which turned out to be nothing, but still,  when you're in the moment, you're like, wow, this is pretty exciting, and they got the  ball with less than a minute to go.  Something could happen here.  The DVR is not programmed to actually follow the game all the way through.  It stops at a certain time.  At 4 o'clock.  And I even knew that.  I even did the math really fast in my head.  I'm like, okay, they're mid-third.  It's about whatever it was, 245, whatever. 
[00:54:30]  I'm like, oh, yeah, this game's going to definitely be over by 4.  I'm not even going to worry about it.  Look at those box of candy canes on your lap, just fly off.  I don't go with the candy canes.  Your Pier 1 ornaments that they just go off.  The one religious thing that the mates snuck on the tree in the back.  Right.  It's like a cut chicken throat, tensile everywhere.  I didn't get Christmas trees for years.  I'm back getting the Christmas trees.  This is like the third year in a row.  Pine trees have the third most oxygen out of any tree or something like that. 
[00:55:00]  Just cut them down.  I avoided the Christmas tree for many years, but I'm back.  I'm back doing that.  So the Jets, Jimmy's Cowboys over the Giants, which couldn't make me happier because I hate Big Blue.  I could have got a ticket.  I'm so stupid.  I could have got a ticket to see that and the Philadelphia Monday Night Dallas game because  this guy I know, he's like a business manager for Terrell Owens and for a lot of those guys.  They have a box in Texas Stadium. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  And they would have fly me in because he has some kind of a deal with, I guess, American Airlines.  And you said, no, you're a trooper.  I'm an idiot.  I had to come here.  I'm a dope.  I could have went there.  Second exciting game in a row I could have watched in Texas Stadium, which I've never been to.  You know you're going to finally say yes and it's going to be some awful blowout.  It's going to be a 27-2 loss to the Titans.  It's going to be 5,000 people left in the stadium.  You get to see T.O. finally implode.  What an ass.  Yeah, what's going on with that?  I don't really understand.  Dude, what is wrong with him?  But supposedly people are agreeing with T.O. 
[00:56:00]  What, he bashed Romo?  Yeah, he's totally bashing Romo.  And the rest of the team is like, yeah, he's got some issues out there.  He's not, you know, he's against T.O. or something?  No, you're the Cowboys fan.  Who is he throwing to?  I have no idea.  Too much.  Okay.  You do know.  Oh, I think, what did he say about Romo?  I have no idea.  Why are you keeping it?  Why are you keeping it as close to the vest?  Because I don't know.  You do know.  I don't care.  You're a big Dallas fan.  No, I'm not.  Yes, you are.  I like Dallas.  I'm not even a big football fan anymore. 
[00:56:30]  I don't like athletes.  I'm telling you, I stopped watching sports.  In general?  Yeah.  Cowboys, I'm happy to see them doing well.  What's the Yankees?  Hate.  He hates the Yankees now.  Where have you been?  After my Jeter incident, I hate them.  Read his book.  I hate them.  And most athletes that we've interviewed, except for the UFC guys, and a couple of the  boxers.  Bernard Hopkins.  That was amazing.  No, the UFC guys are great.  Until they start making too much money, and then they will probably turn on us.  Most of them are complete dicks.  They're these stupid alpha males.  They're not funny. 
[00:57:00]  They're just, hey, you know, they give you garbage answers in the media.  Well, we just got to keep winning.  I come to hate athletes.  I didn't notice about you.  Cannot stand them.  Can't stand them.  So in general, you're like, eh, to all of them.  Yeah, it's hard to not root at all for sports, but it's like.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, man.  We had Terrell, and he was okay, but he was just.  Was he?  I mean, he was.  I mispronounced his name.  I thought he was going to shoot me.  Yeah, he was just.  There was no personality.  He was sunglasses on.  Why do you have your sunglasses on? 
[00:57:30]  Stupid, I should have said, but I didn't.  He was pretty intimidating, too, to be honest with you.  Yeah, he was just a dope.  He wasn't frightening.  He was just a guy with his sunglasses on.  He's like, what are you doing?  What the.  Beach in Miami, you jackass, to radio interview.  I didn't know, Norton.  I didn't know.  Oh, yeah, man.  You can't be the spied athletes.  Absolutely.  I hate them.  Most of them.  Most of them.  Because they have this bully mentality.  They're not funny.  They're the type of guys that want to, like, grab the back of your neck and go.  Oh, they're just retards.  Most of them are retards.  Wow.  Yeah, I really. 
[00:58:00]  I've lost a lot of respect for them the more I've met.  And the more of them that we had just.  They're just disappointing.  They're dicks.  We had Blayrits on the show on time.  So, but what.  Why aren't.  Why?  Okay.  So you said the most fun guys are the ones that could be the worst bullies.  Because they're not rich, spoiled babies.  These UFC guys.  They're just brutal guys who know how to fight.  But they're not babies.  They're like regular dudes.  Guys who fight for a living are more likely to be a fun guest or a fun hang.  Because they talk crap.  They're comfortable talking crap.  Because that's what they do. 
[00:58:30]  Wrestlers are good, usually.  Because they talk crap.  But the UFC guys are not rich, spoiled babies.  Like a lot of these athletes.  No, they're great.  So far, they've been great.  Wow.  Who is it?  By the way, T.O. and Romo, they've buried the hatchet.  Because, you know.  How terrific for them.  They should have buried it in Romo's stupid calf.  He's not a big game quarterback.  They had a big win against the Giants.  And now everything's okay with those guys.  Yeah, after a choke against Pittsburgh.  After a terrible choke.  And I remembered, by the way, when I watched that Steelers loss.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:59:00]  This is why you stopped watching.  Because it makes me want to bite my own fingers.  I can't handle sports losses.  It's too upsetting.  Hey, the Patriots played, Patrice.  I don't know.  Yeah, they blew out.  Oh, there you go.  The Raiders, right.  They blew out the Raiders.  49-26.  You were saying.  And there's something that's absolutely possibly going to happen this year.  That happened last year.  First undefeated regular season.  This year, it may be the first zero-win season in the history of the NFL.  Detroit Lions may not win a game. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, how depressing was Thanksgiving?  They had to throw the Lions on because it's tradition.  I'm like, who the F is watching this game?  They really need to stop that.  That town doesn't deserve how awful life has been for it.  I mean, the Pistons are, but the Pistons aren't even Detroit.  It's almost like New England Patriots.  It's not New England, let's be honest.  It's Boston Patriots.  But they just call it New England with the other teams.  They need something, other parts of New England.  They want to get some fans from Rhode Island.  Detroit doesn't even play in Detroit.  They play in Auburn Hills, right?  Auburn Hills, which is the suburbs. 
[01:00:00]  They're really not the Detroit Pistons.  Oh, really?  I didn't know that.  Yeah, yeah.  I always heard Auburn Hills, but how far is that from the city?  I don't even know.  I think it's an hour or something crazy.  Oh, really?  It's something outside the, you know.  Detroit is miserable, man.  They need something going on.  There's nothing but sadness happening in Detroit right now.  0-14, they got two to go.  Oh, dude.  And they're going to lose.  And they said the only real chance they had was Minnesota.  Who do they got left?  And Minnesota beat them.  Or who they lose to?  No, no, no.  Who just beat them?  I don't know. 
[01:00:30]  I don't know.  I don't care.  Whoever beat them last week, that was who was Minnesota.  That was who they said had.  The biggest chance was a division playoff, a division team.  Right.  Who was going to have a letdown against them.  And they think that they don't have a chance.  Well, they say the Pistons, too.  They're like the playoff hopes got dashed by that loss, too.  Like, because they had a shot.  Nothing.  But they had some potential.  All right.  Hey, you were saying you hate both New York teams? 
[01:01:00]  You hate the Jets and the Giants?  You know, if you don't have that cable football package, you're forced to watch what you have to watch.  And the New York football teams...  By the way, people are calling you an idiot.  The Buccaneers went 0-14 when it was a 14-game season in the 70s.  I did not know that either.  How about the fact that I didn't do the investigation, whoever's calling me an idiot, waiting to hear idiotic things?  Maybe an 0-16, maybe modern...  Maybe they've been playing 16 games forever. 
[01:01:30]  They went 0...  They're going 0-16.  It would be a first.  The first...  But people are saying it's the first zero loss in the...  What?  Shut up!  Anyway, what was he saying about the Giants?  The Giants and the Jets...  You hate them.  And I'm not kidding.  ...are the two most boring football teams I can think of to watch.  I'd rather watch San Diego be 4 and whatever than to watch the Giants win.  They bore me.  I never got into the Giants. 
[01:02:00]  They bore me.  And the Jets are no better.  They just...  It's something about their uniforms that make them look slow.  They just...  They just don't look like every other team.  Like, you know...  Chicago just looks like a football team.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I've got to slow you down because that's a really good observation.  They just...  Uniforms that make you look slow.  No, because some of these teams really have the logo in such a way it has, like, kind  of a swoosh.  Do you notice how fun watching Oakland Raiders play and they never win?  But it's something about them that there's some excitement to what they look like. 
[01:02:30]  What logo makes them look slow?  I'm trying to think of football teams now.  How about a blue helmet with nothing on it but Giants?  The Jets did change their logo so it kind of looks a little, like, sleeker and a little,  like, wind-resistant.  Bill Parcells should just run football.  He should be asked for his advice about everything.  He should just be the commissioner.  When he came into the Patriots, they had that loser man in the huddle.  Oh, the worst.  He changed it into something that looks fast and good. 
[01:03:00]  Right.  He changed the culture.  I don't like the Patriots' stupid new one either.  It's like the guy's head with the half of stuff coming off it.  It's like it's speeding by you.  It's terrible.  Did you hear the word you used?  Yeah.  Speeding by you.  It doesn't matter.  Not just the awful guy crotched down and taking a dump position.  And the Jets, the Giants and the Jets, I'm sorry.  I know they're winning.  And the thing about sports fans, because I was in Texas, I don't like uber crazy sports  fans that, you know, get over this, man. 
[01:03:30]  I was in Texas being very careful about how I was discussing the Oklahoma-Texas game.  There's people that is religious.  And I'm just, I don't want to get people angry with me.  I'm just saying, the Giants bore me to tears.  And the second team that bores me more is the Jets.  And I have to watch them.  If the Jets are playing, Fox can't show, if the Jets are playing on channel whatever,  the Fox can't show a game against the Jets in New York. 
[01:04:00]  And the same thing with the Giants.  I can't watch anybody but them.  I'm on my hands and knees praying and thanking God when the Giants are not on ruining my football experience.  That's why you buy the football package.  That's why.  That's why you buy it.  Don't you think the league would get more fans if they just gave you a few choices every Sunday?  Well, it's the biggest market, I guess.  It's just New York.  I understand.  I don't know.  When I used to live in Buffalo, if they didn't sell out the stadium, they wouldn't show the game locally. 
[01:04:30]  There's nothing else to do in Buffalo.  And radio stations would start just buying up the tickets so everyone else could see the freaking game on Sunday.  Sometimes it's like, well, there's still 100 tickets left.  I don't know if the game is going to be shown on Sunday.  Are you kidding me?  Buffalo might be the third worst.  New York.  Yeah, Buffalo is.  Buffalo is like shouldn't be watched.  New Orleans doesn't win, right?  They lose most of the time.  But it's something about the way that team is. 
[01:05:00]  You could just watch them not win.  It's just, you know who should have had a better throwing arm?  That reporter that lobbed two shoes at Bush's face.  Oh, Jimmy.  I like the seg.  We're going to be talking about the Bush thing.  You don't think the media is biased?  God, he took all his shoes and took him at the president's head.  Yeah, let's get into that a little bit after the break.  It was, God, around-the-clock coverage.  I think I saw that.  Safe to say I probably saw it 200 times.  I have not seen it yet.  Safe to say, 200 times easy. 
[01:05:30]  And now what if that was a gun?  They would have got it in.  What's wrong with you?  They're checked when they go to those areas.  That's why Bush barely flinched.  He knew it wasn't a gun.  He's like, oh, a couple shoes.  How about a shoe knife?  Huh?  One of those new shoe knives.  One of those new...  A little James Bond thing.  Yeah, he clicks that button.  You know, Al-Qaeda got that money.  Maybe get the hat.  Bush was having fun.  We'll get into that after the break, because there's a lot going on.  Bush is smiling like, ooh. 
[01:06:00]  Like he's playing with his friends.  I don't have the info in front of me, but can I just say I will be at Comics the day after Christmas, 26 and 27.  You just said it.  Patrice O'Neal.  Opie and Anthony.  Without Anthony today.  We'll continue.  That's a stupid Monday.  We're getting through it, though.  The day the Earth stood still.  Number one at the box office.  Patrice is a big movie guy.  You didn't see that, did you?  I'm going to see it at some point today, I think.  I'm going to go see it. 
[01:06:30]  What is it about?  Is it literally about the Earth stops?  No, no, it's an alien movie.  It's a remake.  A giant alien comes in and handles his business.  Supposed to be good, right?  To destroy the virus called human beings.  Oh, God.  What a statement.  You know what movie I saw?  Fred Claus on demand.  You know, it's Christmas time.  I want to see a Christmas movie or two.  I can't find my Christmas vacation DVD.  I'm kind of pissed off.  I don't know where it is.  So we went with the Fred Claus. 
[01:07:00]  What a disaster that was.  Did you see it last year?  With Vince Vaughn and...  No, he's never made me laugh once.  Vince Vaughn has never made my teeth show with a smile.  I don't think I've ever seen it.  Giamatti's in it?  Yes, man.  Even having Spacey's in it?  I mean, they were hoping for a big Christmas blockbuster,  and this thing fell horribly short.  Do you know what I saw on the plane going to L.A.?  I watched a...  What's it called with Ricky Gervais?  The Ghost... 
[01:07:30]  Oh, Ghost Town.  Ghost Town was great.  I heard it was good.  I hear it was really good.  I had to turn it off.  Bobby Kelly's in it.  Bobby was good, too.  He looked right.  Like, you know, I wanted to trash Bob, but...  He was a ghost?  Yeah, and a construction worker, but his face...  Like, Bobby belonged there.  Like, he looked like he belonged in that movie.  Right.  He was impressive.  I had...  I was crying so hard.  I can't watch movies.  I'm a girl.  I had to turn it off on the plane.  And I was tearing under my sunglasses.  I had to stop them.  Because I stink.  What got you? 
[01:08:00]  The ghost stuff.  You know, just some stuff.  All right.  You know what?  Let me go see the movie, and then we'll discuss this.  Because I got to see what part...  And then I'll try to figure out what part made you cry.  Let me ask you a question.  I didn't watch Twilight's Web.  I was crying.  Did you ever have this conversation on...  Not saddest movies, but the all-time best cry in a movie, that you go, this was the best tears you've ever seen, in terms of a cry, a movie cry, where you went, wow.  Wait, watching them cry? 
[01:08:30]  Watching them cry.  Not you crying, but mine is Denzel.  In glory.  In glory.  Probably the best one, yeah.  And very close is Meryl Streep and Sophie's Choice.  Or also, you know who's a great crier?  She does it like Denzel does.  Who's the one?  Bruce Willis' ex.  She did it in Ghost.  She just drops that one.  Demi Moore?  Yeah, she's really good at that, too.  She's a great crier, too.  That's all, like, magic stuff, though.  No, it's just they don't have to warn her about that.  My girl said Will Smith from I Am Legend is...  Is good, too? 
[01:09:00]  She liked that.  She thought that was the best one.  But I was just curious.  I think it's amazing to be able to cry.  Yeah, but with that, I want to know what they do off-camera to make them cry so hard.  Well, this is why...  They probably just scream at them, no one loves you.  This is why actors...  Like, what do they do just before they say action?  Dude, and it's not like, you know, if you film something, it's not like...  I'm thinking, I can cry, maybe.  I'm like, I imagine somebody kills my, you know, my dog.  And I'm like, and after that, cut, and I go, wow, whoo. 
[01:09:30]  And they go, um, turn it around from the angle.  Exactly.  What other angle?  More emotions?  Like...  Watch closely when they cut films.  You'll see somebody crying, and then they pan back to it, and the face is dry.  Yeah.  That's all in the editing.  Denzel crying in glory was the best ever, though.  Just perfect, perfectly tied.  Dude, one of the Oscars.  One of the Oscars.  They go to a deep part in their soul to bring up the tears.  There really isn't.  Or is there trickery, and they just get yelled and screamed at, or do they poke him with 
[01:10:00]  a stick or something?  What do they do?  But you know what?  Al Pacino, or, you know, who I put...  I don't put him in my top.  Robert De Niro, I'll put high up.  Morgan Freeman, I'll put high up.  I've never seen any of them cry.  You know?  I've never seen...  Denzel's the one I've seen cry.  I've never seen Bruce Willis cry.  And I'm going to tell you, a great cry, believe it or not, I'll fight anybody over it.  Two great cries is Sly, one in First Blood, and the other one in Rocky 3, when Mickey died. 
[01:10:30]  I know people think, but I believe it.  It was impressive.  I felt it, man.  Yeah, it wasn't hacking.  I felt it.  I'll tell you a great one, too.  Keanu Reeves in Devil's Advocate.  When?  When his wife cuts her throat, and he's trying to save her in the hospital room.  Really?  I thought you was joking when you said Keanu Reeves, great acting.  No, when he was trying to save his wife, and he just, yeah, she just bled out through the throat. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah, that was actually great.  Really?  Yeah.  I got to see that again.  Hold on, we got a couple coming in.  Eric on Long Island.  Eric.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Love you.  Thank you, bro.  You know who's amazing?  Mel Gibson.  And believe me, as a Jew, I don't want to say anything nice about Mel Gibson.  Braveheart and Lethal Weapon, both unbelievable cries.  Braveheart, that's a good cry.  Unbelievable.  That wasn't a cry.  That was a, wait, when he got killed?  No, when he got knocked, yeah, when he got killed.  He got knocked off the horse, and all of a sudden he looks up, and just one tear drops 
[01:11:30]  down off his face.  Yeah, it wasn't an over-the-top, like, you know, cry fest.  Okay.  No, but in Lethal Weapon, when his wife gets killed, he completely loses it.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mel Gibson used to know how to cry in the early days of his career.  Mel Gibson is a great director.  Yeah.  Mel Gibson is great.  He's a great anti-Semite.  No, no, but I'm saying, dude, that's almost a testament to what a great director he is,  because they hate him in Hollywood so much, because he is anti-Semitic.  I don't think he likes Jews at all. 
[01:12:00]  And he still does amazing movies.  Yeah, what's that one you like?  I still haven't seen it.  Well, I mean, The Passion of the Christ was good, but Apocalypto.  That's what I mean, yeah.  It was great.  I couldn't believe how much I loved that movie.  You liked Apocalypto?  Loved Apocalypto.  You loved Apocalypto.  I gotta see it.  Loved it.  Let's go to Chris in Arizona.  Chris, how are you, buddy?  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Hey, a while ago, when you had Kevin Smith on, he was mentioning that, I don't know how the  topic came up, but he said that sometimes when there's a cutscene, that they use a  mentholator or a mentholated vent to blow into the actor's eyes, so it's a pretty natural 
[01:12:30]  reaction to the, you know, whatever the hell that menthol is in the air.  Yeah, okay.  That might work, too.  It's all right.  They probably made crying easier.  Yeah.  Got it.  Figures they would in Hollywood.  Got it.  That's tough, though, because you're right.  They gotta go for so many angles.  It's like, how do you get to that emotion?  You're in the middle of the real emotion.  A cut.  We had a sound issue.  Let's go to Spikey J.  Spikey J.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Is this the Spikey J?  Yeah, this is the Spikey J that sent in the Pendulum remix. 
[01:13:00]  I feel honored.  What's up, Spikey J?  Hey, thanks, man.  How you doing?  Good.  I wanted to point out one of the worst calls, sorry, one of the worst cries of all time.  What?  Ed Norton at the end of American History X.  He said the worst cry.  It almost sounds like he's laughing at his brother's death.  See, now, I'm not prepared for this break today.  I gotta see a lot of these crying scenes now so I can be more involved.  Do you remember that one? 
[01:13:30]  I don't remember that one now.  Yeah, it didn't move me at all.  It's like, you remember the ones that move you because of the moment.  I mean, Meryl Streep trying to decide whether she has to choose a boy or a girl.  And, of course, you argue with a girl.  Why the boy?  I go, because he can make other people.  Your useless girl just pumps out one thing and that's it.  You know, that's it.  I can make an army with a guy.  But Meryl Streep's cry of choosing which kid gets to live or die, her cry is shocking. 
[01:14:00]  You can't even function watching that.  And Denzel's man trying to stand there to take the pain cry is just like, damn.  But Color Purple has a few cries in it, too.  But I'm going to tell you, watch Sly and Rocky 3.  I know it sounds hack.  Crying because Mickey dies.  Yeah.  Could you get that clip?  Is not hacky at all.  Did he just go, Mickey?  Mickey?  Please go to Melanie in Ohio. 
[01:14:30]  Please go to Melanie in Ohio.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's hilarious.  I knew this was going to come in.  Melanie.  Good morning, guys.  What's the best cry in the movies that you've seen?  I'd have to say the best cry in a TV show would have to be Bob Kelly in Torgasm.  Should have kept it at movies.  Did you not understand what made that so beautiful?  Have a good day, guys.  We're saying there's a Torgasm name.  It's still good.  It's still funny.  Let's go to Space Trucker.  Space.  Good morning.  What are you hauling today, Space?  I got 10 pieces of paper, 45,000 pounds. 
[01:15:00]  Jeez.  All right.  Hey, somebody's got to read the newspaper.  I hear you.  Okay.  This is old school, but a very young Glenn Close in the Big Chill.  I didn't see that.  And I didn't see Terms of Endearment either.  I don't know how sad that stuff is.  Well, the Glenn Close thing, was that the rape shower?  No, it's her friend has died, but she's had an affair with him before he died.  That's a really good movie with a lot of actors just getting started. 
[01:15:30]  No, but didn't she cry in the shower?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Here's a weird one for anyone that saw it.  It's one of my favorite movies, too.  It's a New Zealand movie called Once Were Warriors.  It actually did very well here.  Wow.  Rena Owen.  The mother crying in that.  After the kid hung his...  Oh, jeez.  The mother crying.  Great cry, but it's one of those things where it's just too, that's too boutique to actually  put in there because it's so, no one's seen it.  Well, people saw it, but I know what you're saying. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah.  That cry with seeing her daughter, because she had a real trying to catch her breath cry.  That was a good cry.  Good cry.  Good cry.  Yes.  That was horrendous.  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  I'd say, man, I've got to...  I can't...  Man, first blood.  The first, first blood as he's sitting there talking about being a Vietnam...  I bet you he did Vietnam guys proud in that movie.  Hell yeah.  Even though he's become almost a character, but that whole...  It was...  I'm like sly. 
[01:16:30]  Am I crazy?  Is it gay to ask now, like, the best cries?  Is it gay to ask now, like, is it too radio-bit-ish, like, the best cry you've had in a movie?  Because I can't stop crying during movies.  I'm turning into my aunt.  You're actually crying?  I'm the worst.  You're letting go?  Dude, I have always cried at movies.  But I cry at any type of a sad movie now.  I'm finished.  With people?  Anything.  I couldn't watch Charlotte's Web recently.  I had to turn Charlotte's Web off. 
[01:17:00]  Come on.  Dude, I turned...  Are you taking estrogen?  No.  You drink soy milk?  No.  Are you drinking soy milk?  Oh, yeah.  He loves soy.  Wait a minute.  You're drinking soy milk.  He loves soy.  Stop drinking soy milk.  No, I have, like, one of the cries.  Listen to me.  No.  Estrogen is in soy...  Men should not drink soy milk.  You're becoming a girl.  No.  I'm not.  I'm telling you.  Look, he's ready to cry now.  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  No, I'm just becoming a human.  I'm telling you.  I need to start to smell fishy.  We should have a crying contest right now. 
[01:17:30]  See who can cry.  I can't cry.  I won't even listen to you.  Anyone here could cry on cue?  I don't think I could.  I don't think anyone could do that.  That's a special talent.  Hey, there's some mothers coming in.  And any of these you want to go to?  Heath Ledger in A Knight's Tale?  He doesn't cry in that.  What?  Oh, I thought it was a dark night.  Okay.  All right.  We'll blow that.  John Turturro in Miller's Crossing.  What?  I don't remember.  He begs.  He doesn't cry.  I know what you're talking about.  He begs.  Is he begging or crying, Chris?  He's begging and he's sobbing. 
[01:18:00]  He's begging for his life, but you can't.  Because there's snot and spit flying out of his nose.  He's crying, though, too.  Dude, that's a great scene, find it in your heart not to kill me.  He's very good, but to say that, that's a begging for your life cry, please.  Yeah, you got me.  Wait, Jimmy's trying to cry.  Jimmy's trying to cry.  You're getting close.  Look at your eyes.  No, that's just mucus.  No, he's getting wet.  Jimmy's wet.  Jimmy can do it.  Yeah, not good.  Jimmy is almost crying. 
[01:18:30]  I stopped it, but yeah, it is.  No, you got to get a tear from it.  Jim, how do you cry at these?  So, okay, give me a sad, give me something sad.  Did you watch I Am Legend?  My eyes burn you now.  I did, but I don't remember.  I think I cried during that.  Are you an animal guy?  Yes, but the dog scene didn't do it for me.  The dog scene didn't?  Nah.  Have you seen O Yeller?  I've never seen O Yeller.  I have, yeah, but I don't remember it.  Obviously, that was a sad movie.  Cuckoo's Nest makes me cry.  Oh, yeah.  The end of Cuckoo's Nest.  That's brutal.  When he gets a lobotomy. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, when you realize.  No, when Chief kills him.  And then when you see them after and you realize how much he helped them, that to  me is really sad.  When he kills who?  When Will Sampson kills Nicholson.  Yeah.  Oh, you cried at that when he came over with the pillow.  Oh, my God, yeah.  It's awful.  With his feet shaking and, oh, yeah.  Awful.  Jimmy's got, let it be known, because it's radio, Jimmy's got a lot of moisture in his  eyes.  Yeah, I could have.  He's ready to roll a tear down that cheek.  I can go pretty quick with that, but I actually stopped it just because, you know.  Why, man?  You might have Hollywood directors out there.  Oh, soy milk Norton. 
[01:19:30]  Dude, but it was so bad watching this movie that I just, I could feel it coming, too.  Which movie?  The Ricky Gervais movie.  Ghost Town.  I can cry, like, now it's easy for me because I actually slept last night, but when I don't  sleep, and I'm like, I'm no sleep, and I'm emotional, and I'm a mess, because, you know,  your head's all over the place.  So I can't, like, do anything sad in the morning.  Mood swings?  No, no, no.  Like, the onion period or something?  No, not that.  My body is changing.  I feel fast. 
[01:20:00]  Keep going there, bloated.  Go ahead.  Finish your story, menopause.  No, I am, I just, like, on a plane, I'll fly first thing in the morning, whatever, and  I won't sleep a lot of times.  So I was, well, I had to stop it.  My tears were so uncontrolled, I had to stop it.  And then I watched again on the way home, I fast-forwarded through the monitor to just  get the last part, and I still cried again.  Oh, my God.  And the old lady next to me was, I could see her watching and doing the I'm on the plane  eye dab, like, where you just, you brush the side of your cheeks, because we're all 
[01:20:30]  sunglasses on the plane, you brush the cheeks, it's awful.  Which sometimes is confused with the tired, watery eye thing.  Yeah.  I've actually done that with...  Passion of Christ made me emotional.  It made me emotional enough to actually believe in religion.  I actually put Jesus up there as a, like, because I wasn't into the Holy Ghost and Jesus  is the Father, the Son, and I just didn't get into that.  Yeah.  But the fact that he took that beating he took for an hour and a half in a movie that 
[01:21:00]  represented five weeks or whatever it did, that beating he took.  I actually stood up and said, we get it.  He got tortured.  Dude.  But we know just emotional, crying, anything.  I just stay away from anything that has to do with animals, and then I'll be fine.  I know.  Yeah.  All right.  Fredo and the Godfather, of course.  Michael Clark Duncan.  Wait, wait.  What part?  What part, though?  Chris and Rochester, thanks for the call.  When Fredo cried.  Papa, that wasn't that great of a cry. 
[01:21:30]  Wait a minute.  The cry?  What cry?  Oh, we just lost.  Fredo.  Buddy.  He just went away.  I thought I could get him.  Was it when he got killed in the movie, when Michael killed him?  No, probably.  I'm guessing.  The only thing I can think of is after Brando got shot, when he drops the gun, and he's  like, I don't remember.  That was pathetic.  There's no way he could have made that.  He was an emotional wreck.  It had to be, too.  It had to be, too.  Michael Clark Duncan in Green Mile.  Well, Turner and Hooch. 
[01:22:00]  Paul in Wisconsin.  Paul.  What part of Turner and Hooch?  Yeah, I'm such a girl.  I cried like a little baby when the dog died.  The dog died in Turner and Hooch?  Yeah, right at the end.  And then it had, like, puppies with that other...  Oh, so you're an animal guy.  How about Benji?  You cried at Benji?  I just showed you...  Oh, I cried everything.  Okay.  He's just a cry.  More soy milk.  Stop drinking soy milk, fellas.  We've got to stay away from the soy milk today.  See, you learn something every day in the show. 
[01:22:30]  Funniest cry.  Will Ferrell and Anchorman.  I never laugh at cries.  Not because they bother me that they're making fun of it.  It's just, to me, they're always so corny.  Fake cries never make me laugh once.  Sean Penn and Mystic River.  Mystic River was a much better book, by the way.  It has to be said.  I don't remember Sean Penn.  How about the Sam movie where he played the Ritardo kid?  I've never seen it.  I didn't see that one.  I didn't want to deal with that crap.  How about Philadelphia? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, that was a good one.  Forrest Gump, any sadness?  They both made me cry.  I mean, I hate it to admit it.  Forrest Gump made you cry?  The first time I saw it, when he asked if this kid was retarded.  Hell yeah.  They dropped one.  Hell yeah.  Now, as you're sitting down to pee, could you see the television from the bathroom?  Jesus, Jim.  I'm telling you, it's where my emotions have always come out in such weird places.  Like, movies have always...  And it's not a sex ploy.  It's not something you learn to do.  I do it alone.  My first big cry in the theater, I was ashamed of it, too, was when I was a kid, I went and 
[01:23:30]  saw The Champ in the theater with Ricky Schroeder.  I saw that recently.  Was that Schroeder or Ricky Schroeder?  Yeah, it was.  Jack Warden.  That was a rough one.  John Voight.  And who was the woman?  That was a rough one.  I cried recently when I saw that, too.  You know, because I knew The Champ was about to kick the bucket.  That was a rough one.  Okay, Weddy, let me ask you this.  Which, all it did was anger me.  Is, uh, baby.  With Hillary Swank?  Something baby?  Million dollar baby.  Million dollar baby.  I hated that.  Did that make you cry? 
[01:24:00]  No, not at all.  That just angered me.  Yeah, absolutely.  Boys Don't Cry made me cry a little bit.  Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yes, I did.  Million dollar baby?  With her, just her pathetic, the patheticness from the last hour of the movie.  They were trying way too hard to get you to feel something.  No, I'm with you on that one.  I hated that movie.  I really hated that movie.  Hey, Patrice, this is the Stallone thing from Rocky III. 
[01:24:30]  Baby.  Come on, it's funny.  Oh, God.  You gotta give it to me.  Wait a minute, you didn't finish, though. 
[01:25:00]  You have to stop it for a second.  Dude, I'm telling you.  You gotta give it to him.  That's a real cry happening.  He is crying, dude.  You gotta see it.  That's a real man's cry right there.  Yeah.  Blubbering.  Yeah.  Trying to talk through it.  The away-from-the-microphone-sounding cry is good.  Blubbering.  Blubbering. 
[01:25:30]  Blubbering.  Dude.  Blubbering.  Blubbering.  Blubbering.  Blubbering.  Dude, it's because it's Stallone that you gotta laugh when you're...  Blubbering.  But he...  Man, his crying when Mickey dies is up there in an all-time cry scene.  All right, we're gonna take a break.  We can continue with this, because the phone just lit.  Mel Gibson and Ransom.  Adam Sandler and Rain Over Me.  Russell Crowe and Gladiator.  Ransom!  We'll get...  Ransom is a good movie, man. 
[01:26:00]  Well, and Russell Crowe and his kids and his wife is burned up.  That crap...  Dude!  Yeah, that bothered me.  Sean Penn and I am Sam coming in again.  Tippi Tom crying at Sophie's Choice.  We might have to, like, squeeze that bit in today sometime.  That is hilarious.  You know Tippi Tom.  When I was doing Sophie's Choice on Google, I saw Tippi Tom...  Crying?  ...cries at Sophie's Choice.  I didn't click it, because I didn't know what it was.  Go home and...  It is hilarious.  Can we link that today?  Our homeless friend watching Sophie's Choice crying. 
[01:26:30]  Crying as I...  We were just egging him on, too.  We were egging him on.  I'm like, Tom, what are they doing?  Do yourself a favor if you're in front of a computer.  I don't know how you find it.  Maybe Sophie's Choice slash Tippi Tom or something like that.  You'll get to it.  You're savvy enough.  But it's worth a peek, man.  It's funny.  I gotta sing it now.  And funny at the same time.  Yes, Jimmy.  So we're going to break now?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right, just real quick for Patrice.  I forgot to do this before.  Comics Comedy Club.  Patrice will be there.  It's on 14th Street, December 26th and 27th.  Nice. 
[01:27:00]  8 to 10.30 shows.  Holiday week.  Everybody is off.  So 212-524-2500.  That's comics here in New York City.  I saw Patrice at Comics last time you were there.  And man, did you own that place.  I love comics.  You own that place.  Big fan of comics.  It's actually a nice club.  It seats more people than you think it does because it's got almost like a half of a circle seating.  It feels like it's really great.  You were like a pimp.  I'm trying to give you accolades here. 
[01:27:30]  It's like you were like, you own that joint.  You were like, I don't know what to say.  You were a rock star.  People can't say pimp without sounding like the devil.  I know.  I mean that in a loving way.  I know you do.  I mean that in a loving way.  I know you do.  I know you do.  These people were freaking out that you were there.  They all waited around to get their pictures with you.  You look like a pimp.  How are you dressing now?  Well, thank you.  It's just all in that joint.  You're dressing the eye, by the way.  That's why black people say pimp better.  Because white people say it like pimp.  Pimp.  We say it imp and black people are like pimp.  Pimp. 
[01:28:00]  Pimp.  That's all Stallone styles when he's doing Shakespeare.  Retard.  Show's flying by today.  I don't know if we have time to go back to the crying bit.  Too much going on today.  877-212-018. 
[01:28:30]  We could clear the phones and maybe get back to the crying thing.  But you got Bush getting a shoe thrown at him.  We haven't talked about that yet.  That was pretty cool.  He looked like he was enjoying himself.  I've seen the video easily a hundred times.  Watch it again.  And you kind of see the smile on Bush's face.  Like, hey, this is kind of fun.  He's a crazy dude, man.  You think he's crazy?  I bet he fits by somebody.  And they had him.  That was breaking news over the weekend.  Breaking effing news that someone threw a shoe at him. 
[01:29:00]  And that's like the ultimate insult in the Middle East or something?  Yeah, whatever.  That or maybe talking to your wife as an equal.  Who knows what they do over there.  It's just nonsense.  Scumbag reporter.  I'm like, yeah, it's just a shoe.  And someone goes, no, you don't understand.  This is the ultimate insult you could do to a person is throw your shoes at them.  Remember when the insane statue went down and all those guys were lining up?  Oh, that's right.  They were.  That's right.  I forgot about that.  Huge insult.  They all lost their shoes.  That's smart.  I want to open a shoe store in Iraq.  There's a certain kind of logic you have to have in life before people respect you. 
[01:29:30]  You have to.  I think Americans and English people, I don't, I don't, I don't, one of the countries where  you go, Canada, where the way people are, even though it's starting to, you know, the  whole political correctness thing where people are starting to just tell you what to think  and how to feel and all that.  Other than that, though, the behavior is basically logical, logical.  If somebody threw a shoe at you, you'll be angry only because he threw a shoe. 
[01:30:00]  Right.  But over there, it's a statement of horror.  Really?  That means a lot more than that.  Your daughter is a goat.  Yeah, really?  And a big boo to Newsday.  They had the worst headline.  Everyone's trying to work the headline for this Bush story.  Their headline is, No Lame Duck.  Oh, duck.  Bush eludes shoes heaved at him by an Iraqi newsman. 
[01:30:30]  So what was the deal with this?  Obviously, he was a...  Oh, my God.  This one, the Daily News is the worst.  Is he even better?  Oh, my God.  Suicide attack.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious, Jim.  Jim, say that one more time.  Suicide attack.  That's hilarious.  It's the word, S-H-O-E dash aside.  It's so corny.  It's hilarious, though.  You like that one?  Oh, it's hilarious.  Suicide.  I hate these, like, witty little headlines. 
[01:31:00]  A lame duck.  But Bush was already put his hands on the podium.  He was like, yeah, this is cool.  Oh, he just knows it doesn't matter.  Who else wants to throw his shoes?  It's like we need, like, little puns and wordplay.  And what are we doing?  Like, on the back, the big bruise.  Is it a big blue?  Yeah.  Big bruise for the Giants.  How stupid are we?  Like, we need little word games in the media.  Oh, here we go with the Jets in the back of the post.  Potluck.  Oh, because he was, you know, he was called with pot.  Yeah, I know. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah.  And his return, he could help the Jets smoke bills.  Yeah, you know, because he likes pot.  Do you get it?  There's so many wordplay puns.  If they threw, if he threw a game.  If he threw a can at Bush, what would that line be?  Well, if he would have missed, it probably would have been no can do.  How about Afghanistan?  Let's go with the bit for a while.  Let's go with the bit for a while. 
[01:32:00]  If you got one, give us a call.  You know what, though?  As lame as that is, they would go with that in a second.  The papers would go with that in a second.  Damn it.  I'm just trying to think of if something happened over there, you know, what the headlines would be of that in.  Oh, that's funny.  With the Bush thing, the Secret Service guys behind the door there, if you've seen the video, and they just kind of come out very almost nonchalant. 
[01:32:30]  They're not rushing like it's the, you know.  And Bush's people come through the door like, all right, that's it.  Where is this?  Oops.  Where is this a-hole?  They know there are no guns there because of their screen pretty heavily going in.  Yeah.  The media.  So they know that there's probably no guns.  But, boy, they tackled this bastard quickly.  Look at Bush's face, though.  One last time.  Watch.  Holy mother of God.  That guy just missed his head.  And Bush really-  What's going to happen?  So would he have been some type of martyr? 
[01:33:00]  If the shoe hit him?  No.  He's a hero in the Islamic world forever because he threw it.  Right.  They know he tried to hit him.  Now, he's beheading free.  I'll tell you what, that shoe, that dude had a great arm.  Yes, he did.  I mean, he stoned a wife or two.  He doesn't have a great arm.  He was 12 feet away.  Yeah, but he really-  Bush is so quick.  He had that right at Bush's face.  The second one, he barely ducked.  He knew exactly how to handle it.  If Bush caught his shoe and chewed it, it would have been hilarious. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Just he caught it and just chewed the wheel.  Or if he grabbed it with his foot and ran it back like a dog and gave it to the guy.  What would that have said about the U.S.?  How do you take your shoes off knowing that this is a big thing over there?  Dude.  Like, you got to like, all right.  Oh, can you imagine?  Listen to what you just said.  First of all-  I'm serious, though.  Wait a minute.  In America, you can take your-  No one's going to think twice.  He's sitting there, right?  Yeah.  He's sitting there the whole time.  He's planning his shoe attack.  Yeah.  Days in advance.  Yeah.  So, he's done that.  He's been planning it.  Yeah. 
[01:34:00]  And he's sitting there, right, with his loafer or whatever he had.  Yeah.  And he's just-  He's looking around.  Like, all right.  And he's trying to-  It's go time.  He's trying to slowly act like he's-  Yeah, that's what I mean.  He's getting his shoe off.  Because I think even if you made a motion for your foot in that situation, everyone's  like, oh, no.  The shoe thing.  Not good.  You're a reporter there.  They're all media.  So, he probably did.  Like, you know, you take your shoes off.  You just take them off without-  You're touching, like, with your feet.  With your feet in the back of the heel.  Yeah.  And he's sliding the shoe off.  So, he probably took them both off.  But he was dumb.  He ducked.  He threw one, then ducked and picked it up and threw the other one. 
[01:34:30]  He should have picked them both off and thrown.  Oh, he was fast.  He was a quick little-  He had it planned.  All right.  Let's go to the phones here.  Tom in Chicago.  What's up, Tom?  Looked like a case of shoe jitsu.  Let's go to Anthony in Ohio.  Anthony.  Can shoe believe it?  Yes.  Surprised that wasn't.  What up, Anthony?  Yeah.  Shoe fly shoe.  Shoe fly shoe?  All right.  But let's go to Sonny Ferelli.  Or no, don't shoot.  But you spell it S-H-O-E dash T. 
[01:35:00]  There it is.  Sonny.  Hey, if Dick Cheney was there, would he be considered to be a shoe-in?  Wow.  Wait, I'm-  A shoe-in, like, for the seat afterwards, I guess.  Goddamn comedy.  You're a real heel.  You're a real heel.  You are a heel.  Guy was trying.  Here's some quick audio.  The agreement lays out a framework for the rule of American forces in Iraq, a withdrawal  that is possible because of the success of the surge. 
[01:35:30]  Wow.  Wow.  You know what?  Here in the audio, did anyone else think that he was ducking in the beginning of this  and just kept going?  Listen to this.  The agreement lays out a framework for the withdrawal of American forces in Iraq, a withdrawal that 
[01:36:00]  is possible.  Yeah, right there.  Right there.  Possible.  I thought, wow, he's smooth.  He's continuing.  But that wasn't the moment when the shoe went flying.  Yeah, and he missed.  What a nerd.  He should have hit him.  Not because I want the president.  I don't want them.  No, no, no, no, no.  Not that.  That's amazing, man.  Hold on, because I could probably get a visit today.  What I'm trying to say is the guy was 10 to 12 feet away.  He probably should have hit him.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't want to see the president, you know, hit by a shoe by one of these savages. 
[01:36:30]  Dude, that is amazing video right there.  Yeah.  It's really violent.  Yeah.  Like, that dude was violent.  But how unflappable does Bush look?  Anyone that thinks that Bush is not.  Wow.  He just ducks.  He's.  Wow.  He's.  And he doesn't bat an eye.  Let's go to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Wow.  Hey, it was a sneaker attack.  It was a sneaker attack.  Damn it, I always had a thought of that one.  That's a good one.  It was a sneaker attack. 
[01:37:00]  Let's go to Fletch in Jersey.  Fletch.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Listen, if he had been hit in the head, he could have been listed as the sole survivor.  The sole survivor.  The sole survivor.  That's not bad.  So early.  Wow.  All right.  Uh, we're looking for other ones like Patrice, though.  If it was something else that was thrown.  Wow.  What was it again?  Afghanis.  Afghani.  If they throw a can.  The telecan.  Or if it was a rock, they would have said, I rock ye. 
[01:37:30]  I rock ye.  Oh, my God.  So dumb.  It's just awful.  You know, a lot of, we'll go back to the phones in a second, because they're coming up  with their little headlines.  But, um, a lot of people getting fired, as we all know.  Yes.  And, uh, you gotta borrow a line from Chris Rock, you know, with this, uh, CEO getting  killed.  What was his line?  You know, I understand.  Oh, yeah.  I understand.  This guy, uh... 
[01:38:00]  What's it?  What's the whole line that Chris Rock said about OJ?  I don't condone it, but I understand it.  You kind of understand in a weird way, right?  I don't know the whole story here, but...  Well, it was a Christmas party.  Yep.  This guy had fired, gotten fired right before Christmas.  It's amazing.  And, uh, I just, I have, I have such a disgust for business people with the way they're handling  this economy, how they all want to be bailed out, the companies all want to be bailed out.  I haven't heard the word bail out this much in my...  Oh, my God.  But they just want to keep sticking it in people's mouths.  It's like, they really are. 
[01:38:30]  It's cliche to go, ah, a lot of these guys and businessmen are all scumbags, but they  really are.  They're like, they're like, they're like true scumbags.  New York trains...  Scumbags.  The transit system, New York transit system, we're going to lay  people off fire people if we don't get a bailout.  Everybody bailing, I don't even know what it is.  Yeah, it's, everyone is sick, definitely sick of hearing it.  Amazing.  But, what I'm saying is these companies want you to, to take care of them and to protect  them, and they don't, they don't like the Bank of America.  Didn't they get, like, they wanted some kind of protection, but then they didn't want to  help these people who were losing their heart, whatever it was, these union workers. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  They're just scumbags.  They're going to lay out 30,000 people.  Here's the big problem with me, though, in terms of that.  Your job, most of those people are going to get fired.  Their job is to, on behalf of the higher echelon of Bank of America, is to tell me something  bad.  It's just to inform me that they're going to destroy my life in some strange way.  It's hard for me to look at that and go, I feel bad for you.  I feel terrible. 
[01:39:30]  It's really difficult, because a lot of those people are customer service people who are  awful to you.  They don't help you.  All they are, are, and all they do is read policy, and the only thing they really do is  read what the bank says, we're going to F you, and if they don't think that the bank  is going to F them now, now they've seen it.  30,000 jobs, if Bank of America, 30,000 people are going to be losing their jobs.  It's 30,000.  Every week we get a number like that from another company. 
[01:40:00]  The people who have made the mess, a lot of these businessmen, these guys, these higher  upper echelon bosses, who are responsible for it, very rarely will fire themselves.  And this guy, I'm surprised this has happened more.  This one guy, he shot the CEO at a Christmas party and killed him.  And you hate to think about the family of this guy, but in terms of, like I said, it's just  like the whole cop thing.  You meet a cop, you go, wow, you meet cops, you know them as people, but ultimately, when 
[01:40:30]  somebody, you hear a cop gets killed, you don't feel bad because of the whole moniker  of being a cop.  So the idea of a dirty, rotten CEO is almost, you know, some kind of justice, but the dude  is a person with a family and all that, but the idea of what a CEO is, the image of it,  that's what you're like, oh God, it should happen every, you know, kill a GMC dude, you  know what I'm saying?  The Vancouver man who was fired just a day before a shooting at a company Christmas party  has now been charged with first degree murder. 
[01:41:00]  The victim has also been identified as the suspect's former boss.  I gotta tell you, man, I mean, wow, a day before the Christmas party, like, that's what  I don't understand about these corporate guys, it's like, and he's 61, this guy.  How about you let the guy get through Christmas and do it on the 28th?  Well, January.  If you need to do it, well, they would argue that they need to do it before the new year.  Can you imagine?  The day before the Christmas party, everyone's, you know, all happy around the office, like,  ah, it's a cat, it's a cat.  And that guy, that guy was a statistic, this guy who did the killing, a statistic, and ultimately, 
[01:41:30]  if you talk about the death of the CEO with anything except for a little bit of compassion,  you know, thinking about his wife and kids, how can you do that when he made this guy  a statistic, a person, he just made him a not person?  So how can you make this CEO anything but a CEO, not whoever the guy is?  You can't advocate killing people, but I gotta say, it's like, the problem with a lot of  guys, if there's this guy who stole $50 billion.  Oh, we'll get into that after the break.  This guy here in New York, man. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, man.  The problem is that guys who ruin people's lives have a penalty of going to white-collar  jails.  It's like, there is no...  And they keep the money.  There's no death penalty for these guys.  Nope.  But if stuff like that, if people realize, wow, if I ruin X amount of lives, somebody  may actually put a bullet in my head for it, like they would if I was actually out robbing  them with a gun.  And you know what, these countries that I was saying, they're not logical with the shoe-throwing  countries, they kill white-collar criminals over there. 
[01:42:30]  I forgot what country it was, but they killed the CEO for doing that type of stuff.  In India, they did that.  They beat him to death.  I don't know if that was the same thing.  No, no, no.  Not that guy.  I'm talking about the sentence for some dude was to just kill him.  Let's get to the rest of this.  Former boss.  Police allege 61-year-old Eric Allen Kirkpatrick walked into the company party Friday night and  opened fire.  The man shot was Benjamin David Bankey.  He was the CEO of Tallgrass Distributors, a natural health food supplier.  You know, such an unimaginable scene, something that would be so shocking. 
[01:43:00]  You just, who here can imagine being at your Christmas party, your staff Christmas party,  a time of joy, looking forward to the Christmas season.  Suddenly, this man comes in with a firearm and kills someone right in front of you.  At least a dozen people ran out of the party and escaped unharmed.  Police surrounded the building and after a couple of hours persuaded the suspect to 
[01:43:30]  surrender.  Hey, look, it's bad, but you know what?  I don't know what.  This guy might have just been a bad employee.  Yeah, I want to know why he got fired.  I don't know if he was just like a guy who was a bum and had to be fired anyway.  Yeah.  But the fact that...  He was 61.  What kind of bum could he, a 61-year-old, work in?  Dude, he may have gotten caught stealing or who knows what happened.  I'm going to find out more.  It was just one of these things.  Did he say to him before, nice suit.  I hate to ruin it.  Nice suit.  I hate to ruin it.  Now, what's the combination? 
[01:44:00]  Yeah.  It was Nakatomi, did he?  Is that who he killed?  Nakatomi.  You know how bad it's getting?  We do have to take a break.  We can continue with this.  We've got to talk about the guy that...  Bernie Magdalene, I think his name was.  Yeah, the Mets might go out of business because of that.  I will explain it.  I don't think so, but they were all over that in the papers on Saturday.  In radio, I think if you're a regular listener of the show,  we've been keeping you well-informed of all the firings that are going on around here. 
[01:44:30]  Not only at this radio station, but throughout the whole company, right?  And I guess it's come to my attention, E-Rock was telling me,  that the woman, they had one woman, what do they call her?  They had her name for her.  Yes.  The Grim Reaper.  They were calling her the Grim Reaper.  And she was doing all the firing for the stations here in New York.  She was going from station to station, and word got out,  if you see this woman, she's there to fire people. 
[01:45:00]  And so they were going, oh, the Grim Reaper's here, the Grim Reaper.  Make a long story short, this is how bad it's getting in radio.  That woman just got fired.  The woman that's been firing everybody just got fired.  How awkward must that conversation with herself must have been?  Drug, you ass.  Shoe aside.  I have to let me go.  I'm taking my shoe off right now.  I'll just throw it right at the door.  Right at his head.  Shoe aside.  Who fires the fire?  Who? 
[01:45:30]  Who are these people?  Why do people fire people fire?  But the woman that fired everybody just got fired.  That sounds scary.  That might mean that the bleeding is stopping, though.  That might be like.  Can you?  Look at you with the half full thing.  Dude, that is beautiful.  That is.  That is good.  What?  No, it just is so emotional that it's the people who are willing to do that.  When you say this woman who is willing to be that person, 
[01:46:00]  it's so wonderful that she got fired.  I don't know who this person is, but, miss, if you're listening,  it's wonderful that you got fired.  You know why?  Because you took that job under the idea, right,  that she's feeding her family.  And what about my family?  I'm just doing my job.  Well, don't do that as a job.  Look at you.  You have nowhere to turn.  You're the Grim Reaper.  Now you're dead.  Enjoy yourself.  Now, you know why I don't fault her? 
[01:46:30]  Just because it's like most people in that job.  I don't know what her job title was.  It might have just been regional something,  and technically your job is to fire people,  but it never happens like that.  And only in this time, like, you got to go get A, B, C, and D.  And she was like, ugh.  No, she was proud to do it.  She went up in there.  It was pride.  She walked up in pride.  Trust me, Norton.  It's a power trip.  It wasn't I'm sorry.  She loved the power that they gave her.  Exactly.  I'm with Patrice on this one.  Stop, Jimmy.  I'm so with Patrice.  She walked in happy to fire people.  Possibly.  Happy to fire.  Cut off heads. 
[01:47:00]  Oh, there's a new Adam Sandler movie coming out.  And it's Christmassy.  No?  Click.  You didn't see a click?  No, you didn't see a click.  Oh, was that with the remote thing?  Actually, what you call made me laugh, though?  What?  When he played the foreigner.  The foreigner.  What's the one when he played the foreigner?  Come on.  Zohan.  Zohan made me laugh, man.  Really?  I see that advertising on demand.  Zohan made me laugh, man.  All right, I'll take a peek.  I'll take a peek.  Don't ever speak to me again.  What did you say? 
[01:47:30]  Don't ever speak to me again.  You said, what did you just say to, uh, what was your, just, you.  Yeah, you had a, what was your, what did you just say?  Not suicide.  The one that was suicide.  Zohan's good?  Zohan's.  How the girl, uh, fired herself?  Yes.  That was a good one.  That was a trade-off.  I get to say Zohan was good.  She probably went, you're fired.  And then she probably jumped into the other seat and went, what did I do wrong?  And then she jumped back into the other seat.  You know what I did wrong.  I kind of like it.  I know what I did.  I kind of like it now.  I'll make this into a one-person show. 
[01:48:00]  I kind of like it a little bit now.  Zohan's good though.  Zohan.  All right.  There's some things that, it's so absurd, it makes you laugh.  All right.  I'm going to take a look.  Forces you to laugh.  I'm trying to find Step Brothers.  They haven't thrown that on demand yet.  I'm hearing good things about Step Brothers.  I saw a scene at a Step Brothers when I did my, oh, we got to take a break.  All right, Mike's here.  We got to do a break.  I will say it stunk.  All right, should we do a talk about this when we get back, I guess?  The scene I saw stunk.  Boys being boys.  Tee-hee.  Tee-hee.  Yuck.  Enough with corny white guys. 
[01:48:30]  Enough.  Thank you.  Every day, it's a different lineup on this radio show.  Today, it's Opie, it's Jim Norton, and it's Patrice O'Neal.  And Jimmy's got a big gig at Atlantic City.  Oh, yeah.  It's January 16th, 17th.  One of the shows is sold out at the Borgata.  One still has a few tickets left.  TheBorgata.com.  Opie, Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neal.  Where's the big gig, Patrice?  Comics?  Yeah, I'm at Comics.  Right after Christmas?  Yeah, he's 26th, 27th.  26th, 27th.  Patrice has got two shows, 8, 10, 30 each night. 
[01:49:00]  It's here on 14th Street.  It's a great club.  It's 212-524-2500.  There's a lot of people that go to these shows because it's the holiday week.  Oh, yeah.  So call in advance for tickets.  It's going to be a good show.  Got to talk about the wonderful world.  I'm going to talk about It's a Wonderful Life.  I'm going to talk about Santa.  I'm going to talk about a lot of things.  Do you have a Christmas set?  Oh, man.  You got a Christmas set?  Just so everybody would be happy.  Nostradamus.  Nice.  We're going to talk about that.  I like that.  Now, the comic shows, like Jimmy was pretty much hinting, they're going to sell out.  So if you want to see Patrice, I'd get on the horn and get your tickets immediately. 
[01:49:30]  These CEOs, these white comics.  You're really stint about this, man.  This is more than a...  I have to be careful how I say this on the air.  All I'm going to say is this.  This guy, Bernie Madoff, he's more than a CEO.  He's a waltz.  He was the head of the NASDAQ at one point.  He's a massive investor.  $50 billion.  But it was like people like this one, this couple here.  Can you explain for the rest of the country?  It was some type of an...  I don't know how he did it.  Mike, you know, he was a big...  And did he need to? 
[01:50:00]  No.  Did he need to?  He set up a fund back in 1960, and he started setting up fake trades where he would tell people  they were making money each month, but he never sent them the actual paper trades.  He created fake...  Since 1960?  Yeah, since 1960.  This is how he's been existing?  Slowly been doing this.  And he said that he would never tell clients, he said, I'll never tell you how I make your  money, and they could not go online and look at their account.  They had to get paper printouts.  Well, F that. 
[01:50:30]  Which was probably...  That sounds a little crazy, too, though.  And the guy that was monitoring him, the accounting service, was way out of town in a small cubicle-sized  office with only one guy monitoring the assets or the alleged assets of this $50 billion  hedge fund.  Everybody wants to believe, and these investors wanted to believe.  Like, why aren't you questioning any of this stuff?  He made it real exclusive.  Every month you get a statement that says, oh, we're up 8%, oh, we're up 9%, oh, we're  up 10%, and they'd say, well, I got a friend who wants in. 
[01:51:00]  Sorry, you can't get in.  So they begged.  People begged to give him money.  And it comes out over the weekend, what?  He took $50 billion from these people?  This guy, this one family here, sorry, Mike, didn't interrupt you, this one family here.  We didn't get to why, because I know your point of view, but I want to feel why he should  be.  Right now, I don't know if I feel as strongly.  What did he do?  The money, he was like, say you and Opie, say I'm the investor.  This is very, very, very rudimentary. 
[01:51:30]  I don't understand it, too.  Say like...  That's the beauty of us, by the way.  You and Opie.  How we try to figure this out.  Because I want to be emotional like Jimmy is, but I was on the floor once at Wall Street,  so I feel like I know a little bit about Wall Street.  I'm Bernie, right?  Mike, you tell me if I'm right.  I'm Bernie.  All right, you're Bernie.  Now, Mike, Patrice, and Opie...  Who am I?  You're Opie.  You guys all want to invest some money.  I want to be cooler than Opie.  All right, you're Chip.  So it's Mike, Patrice, and Chip.  Thanks.  I get it.  Chip's oral servitude is a company. 
[01:52:00]  And say that, you know, we specialize in draining that area.  That's their company motto.  So say Chip gives his money...  Chip's oral.  Yeah, it's a very big company here in Chelsea, New York.  Now, say...  Now, Chip says to me, here's $100.  I want to invest it.  And I say, Chip, I'm going to get you a big return on your money.  And now let's just say Patrice has a company, and I don't know what I do with Chip's money,  but Patrice invests his money, and I say, I'm going to get you a big return on your money. 
[01:52:30]  Now, I do something, and this is what I don't know, with both of your money, that's not good.  But I use Chip's money to make it look like you, Patrice, got a big return.  And I show Chip, I use your money to make him think he got a big return.  What I read about it, what I read about it is that ultimately the key of this guy's scam  was that there's constant investors.  Yes.  Which means this, investing, the great thing about investing, you have to wait many years 
[01:53:00]  to even decide that this is good or bad.  And what he would do is new investors, he'd just take their money and pay off a 10-year  one to go, hey, see what's happening here?  And it was very hard, by the way, for people to get their money, they said.  How did he simplify like that?  People were not requesting their money because they figured, oh, it's still growing.  And he probably had a way of going, no, look, you want to hold this for at least another  five years or whatever.  Well, you've got a 401k as an investment, really.  And that's something that you don't have to deal with for 30, 40 years until you're 65. 
[01:53:30]  But you can also look at it online and see the actual legitimate trades.  This guy was sending out paper statements with falsified paper receipts for trades.  And he was paying some people off.  But this fall, when the market started really crumbling, people started demanding their  money and reclaiming it.  Which tells you rich people aren't any smarter than Joe Blow.  They don't even have to say that.  They're dummies, too.  Wait, wait, wait.  I just want to say, it sounds like he had an elaborate pyramid scheme, basically. 
[01:54:00]  That's what it's called.  It's a pyramid scheme.  Wow.  Guys like this, because they hurt the economy because they kill regular people, too.  It's really easy to go, ah, who cares?  He's ripping off a bunch of rich people.  But it's like charities he ripped off.  Yeah.  And people like this.  My Mets.  One guy, Will Pine, got ripped off.  A couple million dollars this guy worked his life.  He started a magazine, sold his house, and everything.  Even the proceeds from the sale of the house three weeks ago is gone.  Yeah.  And the problem is, and I'm not going to say on the radio that I would ever want me,  I would never encourage people to do violent things to each other. 
[01:54:30]  But I will say this, that when horrible things happen to a guy like this.  Yeah, you don't mind.  I am happy to hear it.  I am happy to hear it.  And I think the problem is, a lot of these guys don't suffer the consequences that they're  just, like, if I was running around with a gun, and I was robbing people, and somebody  grabbed me by my shirt, and put a gun in my mouth, and blew the back of my head out,  I would have it coming, because I'm a thief with a gun.  The problem is, a lot of guys don't have that coming because they're not thieves with guns.  Right.  So they don't have that fear.  Not that you should be shot for every little white collar crime. 
[01:55:00]  I think everyone's with you, Jimmy.  Well, violent crime, and trust me, I understand, because I said something about the cops earlier,  which is like, you know, once you know a policeman, and you just know him, and you know him as  a dude, and not just as a CEO, right?  Yes.  The title.  Yes.  CEO.  And again, I'm with you, because you know, we got to be careful in radio and stuff.  But dude, to make it fair, and to make it clear, that dude, if something like that happened 
[01:55:30]  to that dude, somebody just threw him off the top of a roof, how could you feel bad for  him?  I couldn't.  I could feel nothing but great.  How could you feel bad?  Now, they can't do that.  I wouldn't even feel bad for his grandkids.  Like, how could you feel bad?  I wouldn't.  Hey, Stump Ring, grab the mic again real fast, because the paper was talking about  how this could be big trouble for the Mets.  I don't think so, but...  Well, Fred Wilpon had invested, allegedly, upwards of $300 million.  With the guy. 
[01:56:00]  $300 million, man.  In his investment firm as well.  But they said, apparently, that's nothing compared to what he's got, or it's not going  to...  Can you imagine $300 million?  It must be nice.  But Major League Baseball has apparently asked for an accounting, because they want to make  sure the team is financially safe.  Okay.  I think it's a non-story now that I think about it.  There's a pension fund in, like, Litchfield, Connecticut, that's in danger, because they  lost...  That's where the government should step in.  When people's pension funds have been messed with, an individual...  That's where the government should step in and go, you know what? 
[01:56:30]  We have to give some money.  Instead of these corporate scumbags who have caused the problems, people whose pension  funds got raped, they should be taken care of.  You're right, Jim.  And I would let Dodge Viper go.  I'd let Dodge Vipers go.  I'd let PT Cruisers go.  I would let Jeep Liberties go for some old person to get their life savings.  Patrice, you know what?  You come up with great bits.  Cars we don't need.  I would love that.  You get rid of a few models, and I think that the big three would be okay. 
[01:57:00]  I don't...  The PT Cruiser...  We don't need it.  Worst idea ever.  We don't need it.  We don't need to bail out...  What's all those other cars we hate?  We don't need to bail out these companies.  You know what somebody said?  I was listening to talk radio just about it and people talking, is like these car companies,  and it's like, well, why don't we bail out other unimportant things that are outdated?  Why don't we bail out the cassette tape companies or the leisure suit companies or the long cigarette 
[01:57:30]  filter companies or the monocle eyeglass?  Why not bail out every company who's outdated?  What about the 8-track company?  That's what I'm saying.  Bail out...  How to go under.  You know, I got into a limo, a car service.  I didn't know what a hybrid was.  I didn't.  I didn't care.  I drive a big truck.  It changes from electricity to gas.  The cabs in New York have that going on.  I didn't realize that.  Dude, the cabs in New York, they look like they're stalling when they come to a red light, 
[01:58:00]  and you're like, oh, man, I'm never going to make it to my destination.  So I asked the guy the first time I was in one of these, and he's like, no, it turns  off.  And it goes back on.  It goes into electricity.  And I'm like, is that what a hybrid?  I thought a hybrid was like, just a special unit.  It's a big thing.  Patrice, I...  Why?  I'll tell you why, and I'm just a newbie to all this crap, but we can't take the hit  in the economy.  That's the problem.  What hit besides, oh, listen, besides the 100,000 namelessness people, like the 100,000 
[01:58:30]  people, their families and stuff, how do we, how does that affect me?  Again, I'm just asking, in this world, when people are concerned about them, how does it  affect me?  It would just affect the economy too much.  I don't know.  I would have to do a little more research, but that's why...  It's the people who make the parts.  It's the people who make the seats.  It's all that.  We're talking almost 3 million jobs, which is probably 6 million people. 
[01:59:00]  Now you're going to throw maybe 3 million, 2 million people out of their homes.  And that's huge.  And the anger people are going to have from me saying this.  Now these people aren't on the street buying stuff.  That's why we don't progress as a society as fast as we should, because yeah, we probably  should just let it fall by the wayside and see what is the next thing that happens.  But it goes beyond that.  I don't understand it completely, obviously.  But it's because of all these things happening with the banks, a lot of regular people just 
[01:59:30]  can't go out and buy a new car.  It's like regular people who are getting just effed.  That's what sickens me.  And these other guys, they still jump out with $200 million parachutes.  And guys like this vulture.  That's the problem.  It is guys like this vulture who have been just preying on people and robbing them blind.  These are the guys that have to suffer.  But the fact that he gets to keep, even if it was legally keeping $50 billion, isn't that  something about having $50 billion in your pocket ultimately?  Yeah.  Let's go to the phones, because this will make Jimmy happy. 
[02:00:00]  Anthony, Rockland County.  How are you, Anthony?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  Yeah.  About a decade ago, Communist China hung two guys right in the square for embezzling or hacking  a million dollars right out of a bank into their bank account.  That makes a statement right there, doesn't it?  It does, but stealing from a bank, it's like, the thing with a guy like this, you can't  just hang him.  It will never happen in this country.  But what they should do is they should stop putting these guys in prisons where they're  not going to be brutalized.  Like, if a guy like this, if you threw a few guys like this in general population of Attica 
[02:00:30]  or of other places, and they were really brutalized, and people understood that there was going  to be a very, very physical penalty for stealing from people like that, they wouldn't do it  as readily.  They wouldn't do it as quickly.  All right, we're going to take a quick break, and we're going to do a little mopping up  next.  We still got to, well, SNL made a funny.  We should have mentioned that after the break.  Yep.  Made a funny, and now there's a lot of outrage.  It's on page, wow, page three, page four of the papers today. 
[02:01:00]  They might be in a little trouble with the governor.  And there was, oh, Sean Avery and, oh yeah, Rudolph.  They don't want Rudolph being sung at schools.  Of course not.  We'll explain in a little bit.  Opie and Anthony, without Anthony today, Jimmy Big Gig, Atlantic City.  What is that all about?  January 16th, 17th, the Borgata.  One night sold out, one night's got tickets.  And not to confuse the issue, and then you got Patrice at Comics right after Christmas.  Yeah.  There you go.  Of December.  This has been a lot of fun today, Patrice. 
[02:01:30]  Patrice O'Neal in studio.  Yeah, David in Arizona wants to explain to you how lost jobs affect him personally.  It's not just people losing their jobs.  It makes other people lose their jobs.  Listen, do me a big favor, man.  I know this, right?  Before you get into this.  So you do know this.  I don't want a, I understand one thing.  Good is good if it's good for me.  And that's how we all live.  It really is about my problems. 
[02:02:00]  And I understand you have a problem.  But what I want to know is, what is it as a people thing?  I don't want to hear your problems.  I want to hear people.  Because this economy thing is about people.  We make the economy.  We make the rules.  We do this.  What is it about what we're doing that's effing us up?  Not, hey, dude, I lost this because I work in a rubber factory.  And the guy who buys the rubber stuff for me, I want to know how this affects us.  What's our attitude that's making it happen? 
[02:02:30]  I've got an answer for you guys.  All right, go ahead, David.  All right.  Now, what happens to all these guys start to lose their jobs?  They flood the market with unemployed people.  And what that does is it devalues employed people.  So me as an employer, and I have 20 employees, I'm looking at a huge stack of applications of people who need jobs.  They'll do anything for it.  I'm going to get better employees.  I can pay them less money. 
[02:03:00]  I don't have to bend over backwards for the knuckleheads that I got.  So that's how it affects the general public.  How it affects you, Patrice, is that the people who don't get hired, they're the ones who are taking your truck and stripping off those stock wheels.  That's how it affects you personally.  Wait a minute, though.  Let me ask you a question.  Bring the show full circle.  I kind of agree with David.  But, okay, I'm not disagreeing with you on this.  But it's almost like, okay, cause and effect.  It's like, are there any criminals who are criminals out of necessity? 
[02:03:30]  Or are they just criminals?  They would be criminals if the economy was good, if the economy was bad.  But how many people are going to be a criminal?  I would say out of necessity.  We've been joking recently that because of the bad economy, you've got some of these fast food workers, let's say.  I just threw that out there, losing their jobs.  Now, those same people that would have been, you know, serving your burger, they're now hitting you over the head with something and taking your while.  I completely believe that.  Most criminals.  Completely.  I agree with Opie, and everybody agrees with Opie.  As soon as those people lose their jobs, they're coming after you. 
[02:04:00]  Now, the only thing that people really want to know, this, Patrice, is that we have two books of Jimmy's.  One's yours coming out.  Yeah, I told you.  Are you writing your books?  I'm not writing.  What am I doing?  Well, let's go.  I had to slow down.  I had to take care of my stolen truck and my sarcastic stock wheel friend thing.  I heard him.  His attitude towards me, you small business jerk.  I can't even feel it.  And his story was, this is Mr. Pain and Suffering.  Ooh, basically, he disguises the most. 
[02:04:30]  He said, ooey, I get to fire the guys who work for me to hire a cheaper, better product.  It affects him in a good way.  Yeah.  But he's acting like it's pain and something.  But I would, I would, I think it's safe to say that it affects a lot of people in a bad way.  But every tragedy affects some people out there in a positive way.  But don't we run this thing?  How are, how, we run, we made it up. 
[02:05:00]  Make up so we can be better.  That sounds retarded, but we made it up.  Yeah, well, the people that made it up have now screwed us.  So what do you want from us?  Most people don't.  Here's the thing.  A lot of lack of knowledge about what happens with the money.  Like, I don't know.  I lost a piece of money.  I'm very disgusted with it.  But I stopped the bleeding.  Could have been worse, Jimmy.  I did not.  It could have been a lot worse.  Could have been way worse.  I could have lost over half of what I had invested, but I didn't.  I lost like 25%, but I stopped it.  Like, a lot of people don't follow what their money is doing. 
[02:05:30]  They don't understand how it works.  And anybody.  Like Anthony in Atlantic City.  Had no idea what he's doing.  Stop the bleeding, Anthony.  Stop.  He'd actually be better off investing with this guy, Bernie.  Who just got drunk.  But like, anybody can get caught in that one.  Because even people that know the deal.  And can I say to people, don't get me wrong, man.  I don't have a dime.  I'm saying to you, explain to me.  Because, look, I'm diabetic, but we are a selfish country.  And when I'm saying, diabetes is not my most upset about disease. 
[02:06:00]  I'm not a diabetes guy because I have it.  But that's how we live is that if it affects me, that's when I care.  I'm saying in terms of how does it affect us as a people.  So, not that I don't care about your issue.  But, listen, if I suffer too, I suffer.  But please tell me, what can we do?  The people.  I'm saying, it's the people allowing this to happen, dude.  We the people.  I'm telling you, power to the people. 
[02:06:30]  But we just allow each other to just do bad things to each other.  So, we the people went out the window.  Now, we're just a bunch of lemmings just sitting there waiting.  Police are getting laid off, Opie.  Right?  They might in New York.  And people are scared that the crime will go up.  It certainly will.  But what I'm saying is, the police, it shouldn't be just a job.  It's almost like the idea of police is protection.  So, if I'm not a cop as my job, does that mean that as a person, it's supposed to be an ethic behind it. 
[02:07:00]  Or teachers, an ethic behind it.  If it's not a job, then you're not going to teach somebody.  Or you're not going to help somebody if something bad is happening to them.  I'll tell you one of the things.  That's people's thing.  No, no, but one of the things is this, though.  Being a cop, we also allow certain privileges to people that we entrust to protect us.  Like, the big one is the ability to carry a gun and the ability to carry an authority, like, with the badge.  Like, we give that privilege.  We don't give each other as citizens that privilege.  So, it's like, me as a regular guy. 
[02:07:30]  You're not supposed to, anyway.  No, but I'm saying, me as a regular guy with no gun, I have no power.  Like, I can't walk up to you guys and go, hey, stop fighting, or what am I going to do?  Nothing.  But you're saying, when it says that stop fighting and it's your job, ultimately, still, there's supposed to be some sort of crusading idea that, you know what?  This old lady's getting beat up.  I'm going to be out of it because it's not my job.  But if it was my job, the only reason I'm going to help this person get out of this situation is because it's my job. 
[02:08:00]  No, because I have what can protect me in order to help this situation.  Most cops have guns.  They have nightsticks.  They have other police they can call.  It is strength.  If you carried a gun.  It's strength.  Would you stop crimes?  No, because I don't have the authority of the government.  I'd be thrown in jail for it.  No.  Would your gut, would you as a person, see what I'm saying?  Would you as Jimmy saw somebody, something bad happened to somebody in the street, and if you had a gun, would you stop that?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  That's what I'm saying.  Absolutely. 
[02:08:30]  As a person, yes.  You would assess the situation and how much danger you're really going to be in if you pull out the gun.  But, yeah, I think.  That's what I'm asking.  Absolutely.  Hey, because we've got to go, and we could certainly continue on that subject for a while.  But as comedians, because I'm not a comedian, the SNL skit about Governor Patterson.  Patterson, excuse me.  What do you guys think?  There's a lot of outrage now.  I didn't see it.  The governor himself is very mad. 
[02:09:00]  And in this article, it says, you know, the governor of New York, for the people listening all over the place, is blind, legally blind.  He can see a little bit, though.  Well, he actually wrote a very scathing letter on a tablecloth and attempted to mail it.  Where the I overlapped the F.  He had no idea.  Fred Armisen plays him, Patterson.  He also did Obama on SNL.  It's a very funny bit.  Very funny.  And he plays a blind governor, just holding a chart upside down and walking out the camera on his cell phone, not knowing that he's walking in front of the camera. 
[02:09:30]  They're in the middle of doing a skit and all that.  Good.  It's good.  It's good.  They should be doing it.  And the reason he doesn't do that, by the way, is because there's people that say, that are making sure he doesn't.  He's got to trust the people around him.  And the same reason he's mad is because those people told him to be mad.  Yeah.  He didn't even see the skit.  He didn't even know.  This is my problem with the whole thing.  Governor Patterson says this.  I can take a joke.  Okay.  I stop right there.  No, you can't.  Well, yeah.  You can't take a joke.  Don't start with the, I can take a joke, but, and that's where he goes with this. 
[02:10:00]  I can take a joke, but only 37% of disabled people are working, and I'm afraid that that kind of third grade humor certainly adds to this atmosphere.  Let's just say I don't think it helped.  Yeah, but they're not trying to help people.  They're just trying to make people laugh.  They're a comedy show.  Exactly.  Hey, Dumbbell, how about the fact you're governor?  That kind of helps a lot more than them making fun of you hurts.  Exactly.  You've got the biggest gig in the world.  I think he said it was because the juvenile, whatever, whatever, was just, was the whole bumping into something, three blind mice thing, but. 
[02:10:30]  That's what he didn't like.  It was the fact that they made fun of you doing the most basic thing.  I'm a blind idiot walking in front of everything.  And then he wanted to say that 37% of something, only something, 37% of disabled people work.  That's not bad, actually.  Almost half cripples work.  That's honestly not bad.  Not bad.  What percentage of them drive, though?  Or throw baseballs for a living.  Very small, I imagine.  Or proofread.  Come on, man. 
[02:11:00]  But as comedians.  We just got to stop.  As comedians, it's ridiculous, right?  That's what I'm saying.  All of that, it's just everything is, there's some things that bother me personally, but everything  is on limits.  On limits.  I know where you're going.  I completely agree.  Everything, man.  There's things that we joke about on this show that affect me personally, and I'm not  going to be, oh, now we've gone too far.  You just let it go.  Yeah, you stop being selfish.  Just let it go.  Everybody's selfish.  This is the thing we have to do as a people, real quick, is this. 
[02:11:30]  Admit that all you're concerned about is you.  Yeah.  Stop acting like this is about everybody, and you're selfish, and all you care about  is what affects you.  That's when we'll go to the next level.  Stop lying.  We've taken hundreds of calls from people that love this show until it affects them personally.  Stop lying.  It's like, dude, that segment, not for you.  Go somewhere else.  Yes.  Stop your moral fiber, and stop trying to make deals with God on my expense. 
[02:12:00]  This story will have legs, and SNL will not be doing anything.  It won't have eyes, though.  And SNL will not be doing anything.  Suicide!  I love it, man.  And, you know, SNL will not be doing any more blind humor.  You watch.  Just kind of like how this company folded, and we can't do Asian humor, because, you  know, Asians don't have a sense of humor, I guess.  That's what I learned about that.  We've got to head over to the other place.  We've got to head over.  Yeah.  Listen.  We're running late here.  All right.  Here's the deal. 
[02:12:30]  In New York, it's Spin the Format, I believe.  What format are they trying now, there, Stunt Brain?  Oh, we've got some rock.  It's rock and roll.  What kind of rock?  Are they a little bit better?  The last I looked, it was alternative rock.  Now where are we at?  It's a little more classic.  Now we're trying classic rock?  Yeah, and it's 92 minutes of music right after us.  Actually, not right after us.  Like, right now, they're going to play a sweeper right into some song you've heard a million  times.  So, check that out.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  All right.  Ah, yes.  The Opie and Anthony show continuing.  Patrice O'Neill and Jim Norton today.  And back tomorrow, I do believe. 
[02:13:30]  I think.  Did we get an update from him?  I just know he was trying to get into the World Series of Poker or something like that.  Nothing yet.  No update.  All right.  And we got a penthouse pet of the year coming in.  So, we're a bit distracted because we're looking at all the fine pictures.  And me and Patrice have the same.  All the fine pictures.  I didn't know Patrice loved big pussy lips as much as I do because that's my fetish.  And she has nice big pussy lips.  She's very sexy.  Yeah.  We're going to get her naked.  Why not?  Let's go old school.  Can I ask her to be troopers? 
[02:14:00]  Let's have her put stuff in her vagina and stuff.  Yeah.  Let's go old school.  Red eye today.  Red eye.  Jimmy.  What?  Do you really?  Tonight?  Oh.  I thought you were doing that as a bit like you want me to push red eye.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh.  You're just confused.  Get Sam while Jimmy figures it out.  You on red eye tonight?  There you go.  You on red eye tonight?  No.  No.  What's happening?  What happened? 
[02:14:30]  I don't know.  What happened?  All right, Jimmy, you figure that out.  Hey, Steve.  Yeah?  Sorry to interrupt you because it was supposed to be Gutfeld is coming in.  When is Gutfeld coming in?  Wednesday.  Wednesday.  When is my red eye?  Thursday.  Thursday.  Are you sure?  That's what they told me.  Who told you that?  His main guy.  Can I see that paper?  All right.  Good.  Because we want to get him in to talk about red eye a little bit.  A show Jimmy does a lot on Fox News.  Fox News show.  You're pretty regular on that, right?  What?  Every what?  Week?  No, they have me on at least once every two weeks.  But they've been, I like Greg.  I think he's funny.  And they've treated me great. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  I mean.  He laughs a lot.  He's silly.  Would they add another regular, you think?  No.  I mean, they have him.  They got Bill Schultz.  And they usually use like a Fox anchor.  Someone who works for Fox.  But, I mean, they're pretty edgy as far as content is concerned.  And it's not very late.  Yeah.  All right.  Listen.  Well, you figure that out.  We got Sam in studio.  Friday show.  I was the only one here Friday.  Every day it's a different lineup with the radio show.  You was what?  I was the only one here.  Jimmy was gone.  You weren't here.  I'm just saying. 
[02:15:30]  No one called me.  But Anthony was here, right?  Yeah.  But he's not here now.  I'm talking about the people in the room.  So, I'm going to explain what happened on Friday show.  Holy mother.  The lineup of the Open Anthony show Friday was myself, Anthony, Bob Kelly, D.L.  Hughley.  Okay.  We did a little something with intern David.  And D.L.  Hughley felt so bad for the kid.  He goes, well, he said, here, you need to get laid.  Yeah.  I'm trying to, like, not blow up anyone's spot. 
[02:16:00]  So, we got to kind of be careful with how it went down Friday.  The regular listeners know.  But we got an update.  Yeah.  Bob Kelly was bragging about a Yankee Cranky shop, Jimmy, that he loves.  He loves.  He went into graphic detail about why he loves this place and blah, blah, blah.  Then it turns out that he likes another Yankee Cranky shop even better.  But he didn't want to mention that one because he doesn't want to blow up that spot.  He was willing to talk about this one place just in case it does get busted.  He's got another place that he likes even better. 
[02:16:30]  Got it?  So, we sent David down to a Yankee Cranky shop.  For real.  And David went through with this.  Yes.  A hundred percent.  We got in the cab and he went through with it.  He asked a bunch of questions and everything, but he was completely ready, willing, and able.  And there's nothing wrong.  We call them Yankee Cranky shops.  But technically, what they really are is massage places.  And there's nothing wrong with sending a guy to get a legal massage.  It's like there are times where, you know, the girls might do things they might not. 
[02:17:00]  But you're not really privy to that beforehand.  But make no mistake about it.  It's a real massage place where people get massages.  Occasionally, the girls might do shit.  I don't know.  Right.  There you go.  And we had a whole discussion about that on Friday.  So, we sent Sam down with David to go to this massage parlor there, Jimmy.  Okay.  And we got some audio.  You taped the ride and everything.  Yeah.  I got as much as I could.  I ended up with like an hour and 15 minutes of audio to go through with this kid.  Right. 
[02:17:30]  But, yeah, we started in the cab or right when we got out of the cab.  And he was excited at this point because we were in front of the place.  Right.  We had taken the cab over and he knew he was really going to do it.  And, yeah, that's where the audio starts.  All right.  I think the penthouse magazines are distracting everyone today.  Big pussy hooks.  And it's not like we have one.  We have about ten copies.  One, two, three, four, five, six.  We lost Patrice.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  There's one over there.  We got eight copies of this magazine. 
[02:18:00]  No, no.  We didn't lose Patrice.  All right, good.  I'm just looking through.  That's all.  But, listen, I'm with you, man.  Oh, by the way, who was telling the Patrice story on Friday?  Was it Bob Kelly?  What story?  Oh.  The Amsterdam story?  Because I wanted to get you on the phone and talk about this.  Oh, I got that later.  But I don't know what story he told.  Who was it?  Was it Bob Kelly?  I fell in love.  Bob Kelly said that.  Oh, I remember that.  I wasn't even there.  I remember that.  You were checking out the girls in the windows in Amsterdam, and you were going in, but you  weren't popping your nut. 
[02:18:30]  You wanted to save it, so you would do a little something here, then you'd move on to the  next one, and do a little something here.  Yeah, man.  A little something.  Okay.  And then Bobby goes, when you finally decided to let the nut go, the woman afterwards showed  back up in the window with just, she looked like she's been through a war or something,  and she turned her sign around that said, closed.  Because, I don't know.  My self-esteem just, I just want, I really want to feel liked when I did that shit. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  I just wanted to be liked.  Yeah.  So, I would go in, and if I didn't, what I was looking for before I knew the phrase  was a GFE, I was looking for that.  We learned that's a girlfriend experience.  Yes.  And then I found that in that particular girl.  She was a soldier.  And we just, we had a good time.  That's 10 years ago.  And you, well, and yeah, she had to put her sign that she was closed for the day after 
[02:19:30]  you were done with her.  But see, the thing about Amsterdam, dude, I don't, I tell you, I fell in love with an  18-year-old girl in Amsterdam.  It was unbelievable.  And I fell in love because she came over, she was the most beautiful girl at the time  that I had seen in my life that was close to me, next to my body.  And ultimately, why I fell in love was because she said something so dirty.  We was on the phone having phone sex.  She had been hanging with me.  She wouldn't give me pussy.  I didn't understand how to get pussy then.  And that fucking girl said to me, she talked like these. 
[02:20:00]  I mean, I don't, I don't say it now, but she talked like these.  And she was like, I, I, you, why you, did you do that?  And you did not fuck me.  I go, I said, you was playing games though.  I said, did you want to fuck?  She said, yes.  I said, was your pussy getting wet?  She said, yeah, my panties were wet, right?  And she goes, let me ask you, how old are you?  I go, what?  I'm 28.  She's 18.  She said, how old are you?  I go, 28.  Why?  She goes, I knew you were young. 
[02:20:30]  And I go, what?  I knew you were young.  She said, you don't always ask a woman for what she wants.  You should have took it, little boy.  An 18-year-old girl said that to me.  Yeah, that would, that would fill me up.  I almost, I had a tear in my eye and I was leaving Amsterdam that next morning.  Yeah.  And I swear to you.  You were looking up flights online.  Dude.  That's the first time I ever got long distance put on my phone.  Yeah.  Like, international plan. 
[02:21:00]  I paid that extra five just to hope to call up.  Didn't she come here?  Yeah, but I don't, she wasn't interested.  It's just.  Wait, you flew her to the States or is she?  Nah, she didn't fly to the States.  She just came.  But God, she was sexy.  Well, we get back to Sam.  So we got intern David gets out of the cab in front of the parlor.  The massage parlor.  Yeah, and you can just tell in his voice and in his actions that we describe how over the  moon he is to be there.  Right.  Okay.  Did his poor mama, poor mama find out? 
[02:21:30]  No, no.  We might have to collect the penthouses.  We might have to collect them.  All right, here we go.  You just hear it, right?  Oh, yeah.  You can hear the whole energy.  The whole energy has just left this radio show.  You're right, too.  Oh, my God.  You are fucking.  Look, I would love to look through that magazine right now.  Trust me.  You are being like a, you're being very correct with the discipline that you're laying out  right now.  I'm dying myself.  I am just looking at titties.  Like, really?  Go ahead, Dan.  What?  Massage balls?  Go get them, soccer.  Yeah, a little distraction. 
[02:22:00]  All right, here we go.  David, we just got out of the cab.  How much money did you give the driver?  I gave the driver $10.  How much was the bill?  $9.30.  Why didn't you give him more than 70 cents tip?  I don't know, because he gave me two fives, and I didn't want to give that much, so I didn't  give him anything.  I wasn't thinking.  I was too busy thinking about the massage parlor to think about a tip.  Just had your mind in your balls, huh?  Yes, that's correct, Sam.  Intern David is out of his mind. 
[02:22:30]  He can't wait to get into the massage parlor.  He's out of his mind.  I got out of the cab, and I realized he was giving him $10, and I was like, are you really  giving him $10?  And Dave said, with the door open, with the cab driver sitting right there, he goes,  yeah, do you think I should tip him?  And I just started laughing and walked away.  Well, let's be honest, though.  Little Dave is what he is.  Well, he's not exactly fighting stereotypes.  Yeah, I mean, little Dave is just little Dave.  But he does have a bankroll on him, so he could have probably gave a few extra. 
[02:23:00]  Yeah.  How much did he give him?  He wasn't spending his money.  He had at least.  He had at least.  Really?  Yes.  Plus, you gave extra cab money.  Well, yeah.  Cab money.  I want to make it perfectly clear I gave him cab money.  It's on the tape that I gave him cab money.  Cab money.  That's what we spent it on.  Yes.  David describes his ideal masseuse.  Yes, he did.  You did a little pre-interview before he went inside, right?  Yeah, because I also wanted to know what his expectations were,  and he obviously had no idea what type of a place this was. 
[02:23:30]  Now, where are we at with David?  Like, is he a virgin before this?  Yeah.  He's never really.  The most he had gone.  The most experience he had was tongue kissing.  Where's he at?  We're getting him.  Yeah.  He's getting food or something.  He'll be in here.  We got enough audio to get us through until he arrives.  David describes his ideal masseuse.  So, David, what kind of girl are you hoping for?  I'm hoping for, you know, a nice white American, regular American girl with, like, a nice body, 
[02:24:00]  a nice normal-sized breasts.  Not too big, not too small.  Nice normal size.  Yeah.  And a nice white American girl.  Yeah.  Any color hair or color eye?  Probably, probably blue, maybe blue eyes and blonde hair would be nice.  All right, cool.  Just a wasp.  He thought he was going to go into a massage parlor and get a nice blonde hair and blue eyes.  Just a...  Just...  Safe to say that they don't stock the massage parlor with, uh... 
[02:24:30]  Which is, which is, which is, which is what his, if you saw that in a massage parlor, you  would know it would be an actual massage.  Yeah, exactly.  Like, that would, you'd just get a massage there.  That's all you're getting.  His excitement was just so, not a massage parlor excitement.  Oh, I love the innocence of this kid.  David's first words after, oh, so now we got the interview after the massage.  Right, so at this point, he went in, I told him, I re-went over everything.  Right.  You know, exactly what he should ask for, what he should do, blah, blah, blah. 
[02:25:00]  Just go in, go with the flow, do what they tell you, and just have a good time.  I wrote Sam, like, all right, how's it going?  Because I'm like, all right, an hour's got to be up by now.  Yeah.  Sam's like, he's still in there.  How long was he in there?  He spent, from the time he walked in the door to the time he came out the door, was an hour  and 45 minutes.  I thought I was just going to go down, get a slice of pizza on the corner, 40 minutes  he'd be down.  In and out, a little in and out action.  An hour and 45 minutes is what he spent in that place.  Doesn't that cost about an hour? 
[02:25:30]  He, they charged him one hour.  Because that, they just probably felt, one of those awful women probably felt like, wow,  I get to, this is a guy who's not the usual piece of garbage, I'm going to really get  him.  Yeah, he told me after.  I'm going to get him hooked.  He told me after that the lady asked him how old he was, and he said, I'm 26. 
[02:26:00]  This is a test of the emergency alert system.  This is only a test.  This concludes this test of the emergency alert system. 
[02:26:30]  If this had been an actual emergency, the tones you just heard would have been followed  by additional information or instruction.  We now return you to your serious XM programming already in progress.  of course, it's his vocabulary.  He came out.  One Yankee Crikey.  He came out.  And the whole name.  That's who he is for the rest of the night.  It's not even DL or D, you know, just DL Hughley.  DL Hughley.  Right.  And he said, is that the proper pronunciation?  I guarantee you found out how do you really pronounce it. 
[02:27:00]  Is it Hughley or Hughley?  And you are going to pronounce that fucker as hell.  Listen to his crack.  Hold on.  You're not going to believe this fucking thing, Jimmy.  We're in the middle of an emergency alert.  They did tell us.  They told us.  No.  It was supposed to happen in 927.  So that's why we purposely fucking took a commercial break so we could clear the field  and play this audio.  What the fuck did we, what the fuck did they miss?  What the fuck did you guys miss?  Someone write me. 
[02:27:30]  Where's, uh, E-Rock and Steve?  Let's just, maybe they got the wrong face.  What the fuck did they miss?  Well, the phones were...  They used to just do these without telling us.  So finally we're like, could you at least fucking tell us so they, so something, uh, important  isn't being blocked over with the EAS test?  I guess DC missed it.  So they just, I just got the heads up saying be prepared.  Why the fuck do these guys even have a job?  They can't push a button for an EAS test?  Die!  The, uh, the last thing they heard was David's age.  David's age?  That was... 
[02:28:00]  What?  Right after said, uh, Sam said that they told him that he was 26, then off.  Play the audio again.  It's basically...  What clip?  So go back to track three, David's first words.  Yeah, you didn't, that's what you gotta do is his first words after he comes out.  Yeah, cause they heard that he wanted a blonde hair, blue eye.  Right, they heard that.  So what, wait, I'm trying to remember.  So you said 26.  Yeah, that was right before we played the audio of him leaving.  Yeah, so, yeah, go back to track three.  Oh, they're fuckers. 
[02:28:30]  God.  What was this, just one of those emergency broadcast things?  Yeah, but we knew it was happening at 927, cause I know people are gonna give us hell,  cause we're like, alright, we'll, uh, we'll, we'll go, we'll break, we'll do something different.  We'll break right away so the EAS test could, uh, you know, go over some horseshit promo they play a million fucking times.  And then we'll be ready to get really, you know, into this bit that's really important.  We didn't miss anything.  Last I heard was Dave said he was 26.  Alright, so Dave, uh, goddammit, leaves the massage parlor and hears his first words. 
[02:29:00]  We'll replay this clip.  David, uh, you just came out with your windbreaker off.  Now, D.O. Hughley made a big deal about the fact that you had a yellow windbreaker,  but you were walking down the sidewalk carrying it.  How do you feel?  So, before I answer any questions or say anything, I just want to give a big thank you to D.L. Hughley for, for, for paying for this.  Thank you so much, D.L. Hughley.  I really appreciate that.  That was incredible.  Thank you so much, man.  And how about the other guys?  Yeah, the other guys, too. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, like, oh, and I, yeah, thank the other guys.  Like, Bob Kelly for showing me the place with D.L. Hughley, man.  That's incredible what he did for me.  Thank you so much, man.  What a fucking jerk.  What a little jerk he is.  What a jerk.  Unappreciative little cocksucker.  He thanked D.L. 50 times.  Well, D.L. looked at him and goes, you know what, we gotta, we gotta get you laid.  He made the suggestion for that.  We gotta get you a girl.  But you pitched in a good whatever, and somebody else, and Bobby, here's the thing, it's called synergy.  Right.  That little motherfucker didn't appreciate the synergy that happened.  Right, right. 
[02:30:00]  He came out with his hair combed.  He was carrying his jacket, even though it was 30 degrees outside, strutting down the street.  And, like I said, he peppered his, uh, his vocabulary with a few mans.  Yeah.  He just sounds a little more confident.  And, to the best of our knowledge, we think this is the first time he, you know.  And he's, I've asked him.  He had some action with a chick.  Straight up.  He hadn't done anything besides kissing before this.  Wow.  We're gonna get him in live, but I wanna get through the, uh, the interview that, uh, Sam.  Sam went through, like, an hour and a half, two hours of audio, and we got the best clips here. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Uh, David talks about the first thing he saw after he got in.  Yes, he was.  So he goes into the massage place, and this is what he saw.  Right.  And then, you go into this, you go into this locker room, and you, you get undressed.  Fully.  Fully.  The exact, and the exact second I walk into the locker room where they told me to go  to undress, there, I see a naked man.  Okay.  With his ass.  What?  So he walks in.  Yeah.  And he goes past the reception area down to the locker room. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  And he's just greeted by a naked man's ass in his face.  In the locker room?  In the locker room.  Yeah, you get it, but I don't, that's why I like the place.  The big communal locker room, that's why I didn't like it.  Yeah.  A naked man.  Okay.  With his ass towards me.  Exactly when I walk in, exactly when I walk in the locker room.  Did that kind of get you started?  That, that, I was like, oh man, that wasn't, I was like, oh no man, I don't need to see  that.  God.  Because then he had to go and shower with them and everything. 
[02:31:30]  Yeah, I hated that place.  Separate showers.  You know the place that David went to?  I fucking hated that place.  Yeah.  Bob told me about it.  It was like, fuck, it's all a bunch of, I like privacy, man.  I don't want to shower with a bunch of dudes and wait in a fucking line, like it's an  assembly, an auto assembly plant.  Right.  I just want to sneak in, face down, finger in the ass, jerk off, take care.  Godspeed.  Wow.  All right.  David describes the table shower as recommended by Bob Kelly.  Right, because you remember on Friday, Bob said, you got to ask for a table shower. 
[02:32:00]  Table shower is the best thing you'll ever experience.  Table shower is wonderful.  You got to get a table shower.  So I told him to get a table shower.  All right.  So I lie on the table.  And I'm like, okay, this is a, okay, and I guess the massage is starting.  No.  What was it?  The massage is the table shower.  Oh, the table shower.  The one recommended to you by Bob Kelly.  Yes.  How was that?  Awful.  Awful.  Bob Kelly made a big deal about the table shower being this great, wonderful thing.  The table shower was nothing.  What was wrong with it? 
[02:32:30]  What was it?  The woman, I was undressed, took the towel off.  She took a huge tub of water, poured it on me, then told me to turn around, poured more  water on me, then told me to stand up, poured more water all over me.  And did you have a towel on at this point?  No.  And then that was it.  That was it.  And then the table shower was over.  So she just came and poured a bucket of water on you?  Came and poured three buckets of water on me naked.  And that was it.  That's the whole table shower.  Yes.  That's it.  So at this point, he's sitting there and saying, they convinced me that this was this 
[02:33:00]  great thing, and all I have is a locker room full of naked men, a public shower, and some  woman dumping water on me.  And, you know, David's Jewish.  He was thinking, this must have been how it was in Auschwitz.  I mean, the great thing, when Bobby would tell me about massage parlors, Bobby's really  into the massage.  Like, you know, when I listen to it, I'm such a thing, like, I'm not going there.  I want to know about the whole happy ending. 
[02:33:30]  But Bobby's into it.  So when he tells you, dude, you got to get the back rub, I'm thinking, okay, that's the  code word for, you know, sucking your balls.  But it ain't.  It's just Bobby likes to go to massage parlors to get a massage.  So you go and ask for the back rub, and then they just rub your back.  Ultimately, he's thinking, like, D.L. should have sent fucking this kid to some place where  it's like, you know, a dick-sucking parlors.  Not actual innuendo, but, like, fucking, because he's getting...  Slow down.  Slow down. 
[02:34:00]  We'll do that next month.  You know what I mean?  We've got to build up to that.  Like, just, but you can hear him, the innuendo that happens at these massage parlors, you  really don't know.  He got, like, a table bath, which is just, it's some Caligula shit without the Caligula.  It's the, it's some fucking Roman horse shit.  Well, it doesn't, it didn't sound like much of a table shower, just dumping three buckets  of water.  Some fucking Vietnamese girl just pouring some fucking New York City tap water on his little 
[02:34:30]  dirty chest.  All right, now we go back to the post-interview.  David's massage starts, he talks about the conversation he had with the masseuse, and  demonstrates his quick thinking.  Here we go.  What's your job?  She said, what's your job?  What'd you tell her?  I said, I work at a radio station, I'm an administrative assistant at a radio station.  Administrative assistant.  Jesus.  What an ass.  Woody Allen's embryo. 
[02:35:00]  Wouldn't that make her paranoid?  Like, this is the fucking media in my joint?  We've always told him.  What are they, doing an expose or something?  Never mentioned names.  Yeah.  So before I went in there, he said, I'm not going to say anything about Opie and Anthony's  show.  No way.  No way.  So he came down to crunch time, and he's an administrative assistant.  All right, here we go.  A radio station.  Very good, because you didn't want to give her too much information.  I said, I said, I'm a, I work at a radio station, I'm an administrative assistant. 
[02:35:30]  She said, oh, how was that?  How was that?  I said, oh, it's a good job.  I like it.  It's a very good job.  I said, okay, that's good.  She didn't give a fuck.  That was pretty much most of the conversation.  That was like all the conversation.  He could have said, I throw shoes at President Bush, and she would have had the same reaction.  She didn't listen to a word that idiot said.  I sound like a good job.  And he's having a real conversation with her.  Oh.  Oh.  What do you do, man?  He probably gave her a card. 
[02:36:00]  Here's my card.  I'm an administrative assistant.  And she said, ah, to everything.  What the fuck is an administrative assistant?  At a radio station.  Sounds like the worst job on earth.  Different inflections of ah.  Right.  I have this much money.  Ah.  Sounds like the worst job.  All right.  Here we go.  David talks about how the massage was.  Yeah.  He also enjoyed the massage, like Bob Kelly does.  And this is like a real professional massage.  Right. 
[02:36:30]  She's putting all the lotions, all the creams.  She's moving her hands up and down my body, up my back, on my ass.  She's moving on my legs, on my feet, every single...  She's moving her fingers on each individual toe, each individual finger.  Where on the ass did she massage?  She massaged on the whole, on the, up and down the butt cheeks, and all up and down the  legs, on the, in the crevices of the crotch.  Did she go in the balloon nut?  She...  She got there.  She...  Her fingers grazed the... 
[02:37:00]  That's...  That area.  That's what Bob Kelly said would happen.  Yeah.  That if you're lucky, she'll graze your asshole.  That little taint that little area.  And he seems so new.  Yeah.  You know, she probably was like, wow, nice new man's asshole.  It was just...  It was all young and delicious for her.  And she's just rubbing it.  She...  Her fingers grazed the...  That area.  The asshole.  The asshole.  And her fingers grazed the...  Outer skin of the... 
[02:37:30]  Of the ball sack.  The outer skin of the ball sack.  Okay.  How did that feel?  It felt very good.  So he liked being touched on the outer skin of the ball sack.  Did you ask him...  Did you ask him if he filled up?  Oh, yeah.  Later.  Oh, okay.  But he sounds like...  The description he's giving is the same tone a doctor uses when he's telling you where  he found tumors and lumps.  Right.  The outer skin of the ball sack.  He would just say the sack.  The outer skin of the sack.  There was nothing sexy about David's description at all.  Yeah.  Unbelievable. 
[02:38:00]  All right.  Where are we at here?  Eight.  Okay.  David is asked to turn over.  He thinks the massage is over.  Right.  And she's like, okay.  Turn around.  Turn around.  I said, you want me to turn around?  Yes.  And I'm thinking of his...  Okay, I guess it's over.  I guess it's over now.  I'm thinking to myself...  I didn't say that out loud.  I'm thinking to myself...  Okay, I guess it's over now.  She's telling me to turn around.  I guess it's over now.  Boy, was I wrong.  It was not over in the slightest bit.  It was not over in the slightest bit. 
[02:38:30]  The innocence of this kid is driving nuts.  I guarantee he knows how to spell Golly G. Willikers.  Like, no one ever wrote it down.  I'm sure David wrote down Golly G. Willikers.  Boy, was I wrong.  Boy, I'll tell you something.  He thought that the grazing of the outer ball sack was going to be the big thrill of the  whole operation.  Oh, he didn't...  Something horrible was coming.  He had no idea the best was yet to come.  Boy, was I wrong. 
[02:39:00]  Where is that little bastard at?  We're going to get him in as soon as this part is over.  Motherfucker.  Look at him.  He's here.  I see him popping around, but we want to get this audio on the air first.  David talks about the masseuse pleasuring him.  Yeah, this is where it gets raunchy.  You could tell that I was getting excited.  So she started to get slowly and slowly to get more and more forceful with her hands.  Okay.  And then after a couple minutes, it turned into a real full-fledged handjob.  If I can...  Can I...  Have you ever had one? 
[02:39:30]  No.  No.  That's what we're getting at.  He's kissed.  He's kissed a girl.  That's it.  That's right.  I mean, now...  She is dead.  Handjob.  If I can...  Can I...  A real handjob.  We'll just say that.  Okay.  I can say handjob.  This is going to air on XM, so I can say handjob.  At this point, I'm super excited.  You got arrogant he's getting?  That motherfucker said, I don't know what to say on radio, bitch.  Oh, yeah.  This guy...  He's going to be our boss someday.  That's just how it works in this company. 
[02:40:00]  Handjob.  This is going to air on XM, so I can say handjob.  At this point, I'm super excited at this point.  Oh, I'm super excited.  Super Jew.  He was so excited after all this was happening.  The post-interview, just the post-interview, took 45 minutes.  I understand.  Like, he was sitting there talking every detail.  Like, the stuff that's not on this tape is him going, and then they asked for my ID. 
[02:40:30]  So I gave them my ID, and then they looked at it, and I said, all right, all right.  Let's get to the good stuff.  But you got to love every second of his experience in this.  It's vivid.  Yeah, that's why I want to play this before we get them in live, because this is, like,  right after the experience.  David explains he started to get frisky.  Yes, he did.  Did he use the word frisky?  He sure did.  And then, I was getting a little frisky at that point. 
[02:41:00]  Fucking Aunt David.  Wow.  Isn't that what Marion Ross said before she was going to fuck?  Tom Bosley.  Tom Bosley.  And by frisking him.  By frisking, he means he grabbed her like De Niro grabbed Ileana Douglas in Cape Fear.  I got you now, bitch.  Who, officer, am I in trouble?  Bites her face.  Wow.  His favorite sex scene ever. 
[02:41:30]  I got you now.  He's tolerating her shitty jokes all night.  I'm drinking sea breeze.  I hope you can afford them.  Yeah, darling.  Tanner in Fargo writes, David is like Borat without the accent.  Wah, wah, wee, wah.  Whoa.  David's saying, wah, super excited.  Should be a sound drop.  Yes, okay.  He's so vivid, though.  Oh, I love this.  David talking about getting frisky here.  And then, I was getting a little frisky at that point. 
[02:42:00]  Me.  Okay.  I was getting frisky.  What did you do?  What's frisky?  I proceeded to touch her.  You did.  Oh, I certainly did.  Was it welcomed?  Yes, it was welcomed.  Where did you touch her?  On her back.  Okay.  I put my hand on her back and was rubbing her back gently.  I'm going to be quite honest.  Yeah.  His newness.  Yeah.  Is making me, like, rejuvenate my lack of newness. 
[02:42:30]  Like, I'm like, wow.  You're excited for it again.  This is exciting.  I wish I could.  This is like a brand new toy this day.  Yeah.  I need to watch an Asian girl run around a room with a meatloaf hat and a room full of Komodo  dragons.  This happiness is just so amazing.  The threshold changes after a long time.  You can't get excited until it's at a certain point.  I can't.  I have to watch. 
[02:43:00]  Like, I watch fisting.  Like, just some guy putting his whole hand in the bitch's pussy.  It's like, I'm like, oh, there you go.  It's filling up now.  This is.  It's filling up.  This is so amazing.  This is the whole thing.  Yeah.  This is the beginning stages of sexual perversion.  Fast forward a few years.  He's going to be in a dungeon somewhere in high heels, like, on his tippy toes, hoping  he could, like, you know, balance himself so he doesn't choke himself.  And remember this moment.  Remember this moment.  I don't know if you remember this, if you're a cartoon watcher.  Yeah.  Old school cartoons.  Yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Yogi Bear and the Chinese, the Japanese bear, the picnic basket bear.  You remember that episode where the Chinese bear came from?  He said, like, look, look, the ranger's like, don't feed him picnic basket food.  Right.  And he said, okay, no problem.  Yogi was like, hey, this is in.  And the bear just got strung out.  Picnic basket!  And he just started slipping people over chairs and beating their asses.  For picnic basket food?  Can we find that clip?  That's this kid.  It's the Chinese picnic.  Yogi, find that clip in the back.  Oh, it's great.  All right, right. 
[02:44:00]  And he, um, he's him.  He comes in there straight laced and it's over now.  He walked out of there and, like, I was down the block.  So I was meeting him.  So we were meeting him.  And before I was even close enough to hear him speak, he just stopped, smiled ear to ear,  and gave me a big thumbs up.  It was great.  All right, let's get back to this.  So, uh, Dave explains he's starting to get frisky.  We're in the middle of that still.  While she was giving me the, while she was giving me the hand job.  Okay.  And I was really frisky.  And I was really getting, like, super excited. 
[02:44:30]  Woo!  Well, super excited, super frisky.  So I took my hand and placed it under the, under her, whatever.  I don't even know what the hell she was wearing under.  And I was massaging her back underneath her shirt.  The back underneath the shirt.  And I felt her back and the, the back strap of her bra.  Did that excite you?  It did excite me.  Someone is saying we got to get all this up online.  They all should be ringtones.  There's a lot of ringtones in here.  I want to find a place to air the complete 40-minute interview.  Really?  Yeah. 
[02:45:00]  It's not a bad idea.  Maybe a little podcast or something.  I'm amazed, dude.  This is so.  I don't remember when.  I think I got my first pussy at 13.  Mm-hmm.  But I still wasn't even innocent.  I'm a piece of shit.  I think I've always been.  And, I mean, this kid, the joy of his first fucking piece of, it's just a, it's beautiful.  Hand job.  Hand job.  Not even asked.  I touched her bra.  I'll tell you.  He probably just touched her bra. 
[02:45:30]  Can I, can I tell you an innocent moment that still gets me horny, like, in terms of sexuality?  Of course.  But it's still creepy, but it's still innocent.  It's when a girl wants to give you some pussy, and just watching new panties come down to  the part where the ass starts, where it's half ass meat and hips, when you just know  that pussy's about to happen, that's still the thing, the regular sex thing that'll still 
[02:46:00]  get me, is just new, getting ready to see new pussy.  Not even seeing it.  It's fucking great!  I just realized we do have our own channel.  We could play the full interview at 11.  Yeah.  I mean, we should warn the people, it might get a little slow, but, uh...  Yeah, points, but I mean, it's fun, yeah.  You think it's worth it?  Yeah.  Alright, can you get that?  Yeah, I'll do it while we're interviewing.  We'll try to play the whole interview at 11, the long form.  Something a little different today.  What the hell?  David continues to touch the masseuse. 
[02:46:30]  And I proceeded to move my hands, move my hands.  Where'd you move them to?  To the, to the front of her, to her front area.  To her stomach?  Yes.  And?  Her breasts.  You touched her breasts?  I didn't, when I say touched her breasts, I didn't actually touch her, her full, full-fledged  breasts.  I touched her breasts with the bra, while the bra was on.  But under the shirt?  I touched her breasts under the shirt with a bra on.  With, with bra on.  And it was welcomed. 
[02:47:00]  I heard.  I was, I was grazing, I wasn't like, I wasn't like squeezing it and grabbing it, I was caressing  it and I was slowly massaging it gently.  I wasn't caressing it, I wasn't squeezing it and, and it was welcomed, yes.  I can't wait to talk to him live.  Did you catch that?  What part?  I'm gonna tell you what he was doing.  Yeah.  He wasn't sure what to do.  Mm-hmm.  So this motherfucker was being a creep.  He was, it was, it was the equivalent of looking under a girl's skirt on the train. 
[02:47:30]  It's like he was touching places just to see if he was going to be told not to.  Right.  He didn't know what was allowed.  He, so he was just being a dirty little sneak, a dirty little sneak.  I'm telling you, you opened up some real bad shit right here.  I think so too.  He's just a fucking little piece of garbage, my David is.  I think you're right.  Yes, he is.  A sneaky little piece of garbage.  We're starting David out with a little pot, just a little bit, a little taste of pot and  man, he's gonna be a meth head.  Oh, his, his first rim job, his first full mouth on his dick. 
[02:48:00]  He's gonna do one of those warps from Stargate, just back to pyramid time.  It's gonna just take a back time.  He's gonna end up selling his own body to get money so he can continue down this road.  If you can find Piccadick Basket, please do.  Hopefully we can find it.  Piccadick Basket!  David talks about the size of his penis.  Yes.  All right, we'll skip that track.  You're kidding, right?  Yeah.  Why?  I was kidding. 
[02:48:30]  Oh.  Nothing I want to hear about his dick.  I'm kidding.  Because that's what I am wondering, a little Jew boy.  I wonder about his little circumcised mop.  Let's guess.  Does he say how big it is?  He gives a number.  You know he's gonna lie.  I don't think he's lying.  No, actually, I'm gonna go with four inches.  I bet he's six to seven.  All right, Patrice is six to seven, between five and a quarter and five and a half.  Do you think so?  I know.  How do you know?  I can sense by his dumb glasses. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  Now, God just doesn't make...  Wait, Jimmy, what do you say?  God does great things, man.  No, five and a quarter to five and a half.  What the...  All right.  I'd say he's about six, seven.  I just think...  Six to seven?  Yeah, God just doesn't do that, man.  God will not let that boy have a small dick.  Hell fucking no.  I'm gonna go...  God allows children to have their arms cut off a couch.  Good point.  Good point.  Very fair.  Yeah, very fair.  Yeah, he allows genocide, so he'll allow that asshole to have a small dick.  He's got nothing.  You think...  He's going...  I'm going nothing. 
[02:49:30]  Really?  Nothing?  My official guess is four inches.  And he has...  You know what, though?  You're right, because he doesn't even...  Because I know...  I bet you Sam's packing, because Sam has a...  He has cocked shortness.  You know what I mean?  Like, so David doesn't even have that assuredness, like he has a big dick.  You might be right.  Yeah.  I'm drifting off of it.  I'm still going to stick with six.  Six.  All right.  Here we go.  And then I was really super excited.  Were you packing a full rod?  I was packing a full rod.  How big would you assume? 
[02:50:00]  It was a good close to four and a half, five inches.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  What did he say?  Four and a half to five and a half?  Four and a half to five, but keep playing the track.  I don't think you have any credit.  All right.  Jimmy might be leading.  I said four.  Jimmy said five and a half, pretty much, on the nose.  I said five and a quarter to five and a half.  Yeah.  Well, that's close enough.  Hold on.  And then I was really super excited.  Were you packing a full rod?  I was packing a full rod.  How big would you assume?  It was a good close to four and a half, five inches. 
[02:50:30]  Okay.  It was good.  Because that's my normal, like, five.  I pretty much say five.  Maybe sometimes five and a half.  You'll max out around five, five and a quarter?  Yes.  Okay.  I will, yes.  Jimmy nailed it.  Jimmy nailed it.  Yep.  Right on the money.  Who's the kid?  Who's the kid?  That's right.  I don't know what stocks to pick, but you show me a fucking intern.  I'll tell you how big his dick is from two miles away.  You're the cock kid.  Who has the biggest dick out of all interns?  I don't know.  I'm asking Norton.  He's a dick-sized expert. 
[02:51:00]  All right.  Line them up.  How many interns we got today?  Four.  Yeah.  Line them up after the break.  When we bring in the pet house.  Your feel.  Because that was just a feel, right?  Yeah.  You just had a feel.  Okay.  All right.  We're going to line them up, and Jimmy's going to tell who has the biggest cock among  them.  Okay?  And they should write it down.  Okay.  Steve, get this going.  I already know.  They hold it to their chest.  Jimmy will guess, and then they'll reveal.  And we don't want any lying by these fuckers.  David gets the two-minute warning.  What's this about there, Sam? 
[02:51:30]  Well, there is a time restriction to how long you're allowed to be on the masseuse table.  Okay.  And David found that out the hard way.  All right.  And she proceeded to stroke, and I said, oh, yes.  Yes.  That was me thinking, oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  My arms were both around her.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  His arms were around her.  Not gone with the wind, you asshole.  You're blowing a load.  She's paying off a slavery ship debt.  Paying off the wolf. 
[02:52:00]  Paying off the wolf.  And he says it like it should be a comic book fuck bubble.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  He absolutely spells it.  She just wants to get the promotion to nails, and he's holding her.  Oh, my God.  The nail promotion.  Can I move the feet now?  I'm going to leave.  And I figured out the whole hierarchy.  You start with the Yankee Cranky shop, then you go to nails, and then, if you're really  lucky, sushi waitress. 
[02:52:30]  Nigga, that is the queen of third worldess.  Or breaking down old computer parts for the mercury.  David gets the two-minute warning.  And she proceeded to stroke, and I'm like, oh, yes.  Yes.  That was me saying, oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  My arms were both around her.  I'm like, oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  I'm trying to make myself go faster.  And then she proceeded to say, two minutes left.  Two minutes left. 
[02:53:00]  And then I proceeded to say, oh, no.  Did you say that?  I said, oh, no.  Yes.  You said that out loud?  Oh, no.  Oh.  And she said, yes.  Two minutes.  Yes, two minutes left.  And so I proceeded to say, moan, and say, oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  And she got excited.  No, she didn't.  No, she didn't.  We got to get David in here.  We're going to.  Let him have it.  Let him have it.  We will.  We have one more track, and then it's David live on the show.  I just want to get the pure innocence of what happened right after. 
[02:53:30]  Just let him keep the illusion.  Oh, yes.  Oh, yes.  And she got excited.  Yeah.  And she was like, and she got a look on her face like, oh, yes.  And she was really excited.  If I can say the words that she said to me.  Yes.  She said, oh, come.  Come.  She said that.  Not me.  She said, oh, come.  Come.  David fucking rolled. 
[02:54:00]  And I bet you sounded just like that, too.  God bless him.  Oh, come.  C-O-O-M.  God love that boy.  He was convinced, by the way, that she really liked him.  Yeah.  So.  All right.  We're going to get into all that.  One more track here.  David talks about making the cum scenes.  This is it.  But you're like, oh, come.  Yes.  Come.  And then did you?  Eventually, yes, I did. 
[02:54:30]  Yes, I did.  Eventually.  Did you make the two-minute mark?  I think it was way past two minutes.  I think she forgot about the two minutes after that.  She forgot about the two minutes.  Do you think that you just got her so excited that she forgot?  I think so.  I think so.  Did she clean you up?  She proceeded to take another towel and, yes, she cleaned me up.  Yes, she certainly did.  How far did it shoot?  If I can be honest, it did not shoot at all.  Did it just kind of gurgle over like a volcano?  Yes, it certainly did. 
[02:55:00]  It gurgled over like a volcano.  Yes, it did.  No, zero.  It wasn't a shooting, no shooting at all.  All right, listen, there's two things going on.  His dick fucking vomited like Bob Scott in the car.  Right.  There's two things going on.  He either has some kind of medical issue or this guy jerks off so much that there's just  nothing going on.  There's a lot of jerking.  There's a lot of jerking.  Here's what that is.  He has so much cum rushing to get out.  It just bumped into each other.  It got stuck at the tip.  Yeah.  He wanted to cum so bad, his body couldn't, the muscles couldn't tighten. 
[02:55:30]  There was too much cum around.  And subsequently, my cum just kind of poured out.  His dick hemorrhaged.  All right, you want to talk to David now or you want to take a quick break?  I want to piss and get a break.  I want to get David.  I want to get these other interns in to get, and I want to get this penthouse pet in so  at least we can fucking have a girl in here because this is kind of fucking fruity and  homoerotic.  We'll get the penthouse pet in.  Pet of the year?  Pet of the year?  Pet of the year?  Thumbs up?  Pet of the year, right?  Thumbs up.  Pet of the year.  We'll get her in.  We'll get intern David in. 
[02:56:00]  And I hope we're working on the interns.  We want to have a contest.  Yeah.  We want Jimmy to figure out who has the biggest talk.  I would also like to get a chick's guess, too.  I don't want to just fucking be guessing.  That's why I want to go in here.  It's kind of creepy.  And they'll hold up their size, you know, on a card in front of them, and then they'll  reveal.  Yes.  You get how this is going to work, Steve?  That's what it's out.  No.  Oh, you don't.  You know what we're doing right now?  Do you know?  I started working on it.  All right.  How are we going to do this, then?  Because I explained it twice.  We're going to guess what the interns are packing.  How?  How?  By holding up a card. 
[02:56:30]  Okay, good.  Okay.  And they put the size on it.  Right.  And they don't reveal it until we're done with all the guesses.  Right.  All right.  Okay.  You did figure it out.  My fault.  Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neill, Jimmy, what are we promoting as we go to break here?  Patrickey is out first.  He's got comics, December 26th and 27th here in New York City, 8 and 1030 shows, and I  have, I'm going to plug New Year's Eve.  I just booked a New Year's Eve gig.  January, December 31st, the greatest club name ever, Crocodile Rock in Allentown, Pennsylvania. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, my God.  I just booked this on Friday.  Tickets are on sale now.  You can go to Ticketmaster.com, or you can, that's all you can do.  It's one show only, 8 o'clock, New Year's Eve, Crocodile Rock in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Are you going to ring in the New Year in Allentown?  From 8 o'clock?  No.  Are you going to rush out of there?  No, because a lot of people don't want to go out past 12.  They'll come to the show and then go to a bar or whatever.  A lot of people don't want to be in a place for six hours. 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, you're finished by 11 or so.  Listen, Joe Donuts from Rottenchester Volcano.  I just spit coffee all over my new laptop.  And then Adam in Vegas, this is for Jimmy.  Jimmy, oh, please say on air that Jimmy kicked ass at the Viper Room.  He needs to come back to the West Coast more often.  Thank you.  First time you did L.A.  As far as, like, in that regard or whatever.  Yeah, it was cool.  Dice came to his show.  Ron Jeremy came to his show.  It was fun, man.  I was hanging out with the big celebs out there in Hollywood.  One I know, and one is just going to big cock. 
[02:58:00]  I was trying to pump it up a little bit.  I don't think I knew.  I was just trying to help me out a little.  All right.  Intern David live on the show next.  The Penthouse Pet of the Year next.  And also, guys.  You turn penises.  Yeah, we're going to.  Wow.  All right.  Hope you're in that.  All right.  We've got to bring in David.  I hope you didn't go anywhere.  David went to his first Yankee Cranky Shop.  They're all developed on Friday's show with Bob Kelly and D.L. Hughley. 
[02:58:30]  And I really didn't think we were going to get this happening.  But it did happen.  David was more than a trooper.  Should we get the Penthouse Pet in here, too?  Yes.  How do you say her name?  Taya.  I believe Taya.  Taya Parker.  Pet of the Year.  Head of the Year.  Walking into our studio.  Can I see a book?  Can I see one of those books, then?  Oh, you guys are going to look at my naked pictures while I'm sitting here.  Is that bad?  No, that's kind of funny. 
[02:59:00]  We were looking at them when we started the show today.  Or this side of the show.  You don't get embarrassed, right?  Oh, hell no.  Are you kidding?  Embarrassed of what?  That's good.  What's there left to be embarrassed about?  How long have you been posing naked?  Wow.  I shot with Penthouse for the first time in 2005.  And then I had been doing it like a couple years before that.  So maybe, wow, maybe six years.  Nice.  In the polls and... 
[02:59:30]  Hi.  Hi, by the way.  That's Patrice on the year.  You have to say hi before you make any comments about my nakedness.  No, I didn't even get to it.  Are you worried we're going to comment about your nakedness?  No, I love it when people comment.  I looked at it earlier, and the only comment I do have is that you have the vagina that  I enjoy looking at.  Thank you.  I actually...  It's so funny.  I used to be...  It has character.  Thank you.  Does she have character?  She?  Yes, she has character.  Does she have character?  What do you call her?  What do you call her?  It can't be a boy.  Yes, she has character.  Some girls don't name their vaginas like men name them.  And their penises.  But you said she, like you kind of have a relationship with her. 
[03:00:00]  Where is she?  Yeah, yeah.  Usually some have lines.  A lot of penthouse ones have just the lines.  Yours has...  I have lips.  Your stuff...  You can be as gory as you want.  I know.  I haven't described to me before.  I'm not weak of heart.  It's like an aerial view of the U.S.  And I mean that in a beautiful way.  I love...  It's very full, and the lips are thick.  I agree with you.  It's meaty.  I know.  It is.  It looks like you might have too much salt in your diet.  Just kind of... 
[03:00:30]  I have too much salt?  Maybe.  It's possible.  Okay, small here.  Let me ask you this.  I was making a puffy joke.  It's either too much salt or too much sex.  One or the other.  I'm not sure.  Maybe a little bit of that.  Now, in the...  In the...  The naked game.  I was curious about this.  The naked game?  The naked game.  Yeah.  Okay.  Is...  How far up, down, parallel is Penthouse to Playboy in terms of prestige in the game  of nakedness? 
[03:01:00]  Well, I guess...  I guess it's open the book.  In the regular person game, it's Hustler, Penthouse, Playboy in terms of low to high.  That's for the lame who doesn't...  Right.  Well, and I'm glad you asked because I wouldn't bring it up, but I've worked for Penthouse  and Playboy, obviously.  I'm with Penthouse now.  The thing, the misconception right now is that Penthouse is, back in the day, where there  was a lot of full frontal look inside and golden showers and all that, and Penthouse 
[03:01:30]  is, since the new owners have bought it in about 2005, they're definitely softening  it.  They were showing insertion at one point, hardcore insertion.  Well, they're trying to compete with the internet.  Yeah, absolutely.  I want to answer Patrice's question.  I think Penthouse is like the ABA, and Playboy is like the NBA.  They get a little crazier in the ABA than the NBA.  No, because I'm looking at it through this, and here's the...  Well, they've changed.  I mean, you can see it's looking more like Playboy.  Here's what Penthouse has now, no offense.  Penthouse would never have big pussy lips. 
[03:02:00]  Like, that is, they would only have line pussies.  You're saying Penthouse or Playboy?  Penthouse.  No.  Playboy would.  No, Playboy was all just lines.  Playboy is corny.  Playboy.  Playboy never showed...  Yes, right, right, right, right, right.  Playboy would never show a messy one.  No, never.  They would never show a full pussy.  Hell no.  It would not be nasty.  I have a fetish.  I like, I ferociously like a fat vagina.  I think it's meaty.  I think it's full.  But you're right.  Playboy shows only those fucking quote unquote, those stupid Pam Anderson ones, which is just like 
[03:02:30]  a fucking...  Like an Asian eye.  It's not fucking sexy at all.  It's like, ugh, terrible.  Like you used to say a chimp, a chimp's mouth.  No, I like those.  It's fat.  When I got turned off to Playboy...  Well, but still the line, though, and then the big lips.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, see, this is the thing.  If any girl will get naked for Playboy for free, they're like, ooh, Playboy, and they'll  all take their clothes off.  Oh, shit.  That's trash talk.  Huh?  No, it's not trash talk.  It's because they've...  But this is the thing.  That Playboy's opened all these websites now, and so they need more content.  So I think the caliber of girl has gone down.  Whereas Playboy used to be like, ooh, we have all these gorgeous girls. 
[03:03:00]  I mean, if you've opened any of their sub-publications lately, it's kind of like, ooh, those girls  couldn't have been in Playboy like five years ago.  Well, Playboy's thing is this.  They're the name as far as...  Because they started it.  I mean, let's be honest.  Hefner started it long before most of the magazines did.  Yeah, but with him, it's a lifestyle.  With these guys, it's a job.  I mean, if you've met the owners of the new Penthouse, they're very professional.  They're very, you know, businessmen.  No, what I mean is, Playboy has the reputation of getting, like, the celebrities.  Like, well, she posed in Playboy.  Like, it's just become this way of speaking, like, when you go to Xerox something. 
[03:03:30]  Give me a Xerox.  Penthouse had Vanessa Williams.  That was the big scandal.  But they had...  Who did, uh...  Who did Playboy...  Playboy's gotten everybody.  Everybody, pretty much.  And I prefer Penthouse.  That's right.  Penthouse is a better magazine, because the girls...  I think the girls are sexier, and I like the shots they show.  Playboy, to me, is too antiseptic.  Like, it's going to be a doctor's office.  Oh, and that's what I meant about the difference, the comparison, is that Playboy, Penthouse  will show a girl that's a little bit slutty.  A little skank. 
[03:04:00]  Hell yeah.  Yeah.  Just a little skank.  And I think if you're going to see naked chicks, I mean, you want a little skank, right?  Come on.  You want to believe...  You want a pimple or something in there.  You want to believe.  You just want to believe.  Shut up.  I have a question for you, too.  The Pet of the Year is obviously the high place to be.  So what happens?  You're a Pet of the Month at one point, and then they vote you in as Pet of the Year?  Yes.  I was Pet of the Month in January of 2008, so I just got named Pet of the Year, so I'll  be Pet of the Year for all of 2009. 
[03:04:30]  Do you make extra money doing that?  I can make extra money.  Are you offering?  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  And what's your extra money-ness?  Well, no.  I mean, it's just...  It's an opportunity for me to go on.  No, no, no.  In the game.  In the game.  What's extra money in the game?  Jimmy's being serious.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I'm saying I do more pictorials.  They'll shoot me all year.  Not just for you.  Let's leave the realm of just you.  Okay.  Meaning if a girl was to get into the game.  Okay.  And what is the extra money you can make in this game without losing your job on Pinhouse? 
[03:05:00]  Do you feel what I'm saying?  Right.  Well, I am an exotic dancer as well.  You should have.  But I'm a feature entertainer.  I'm like a Las Vegas style showgirl.  First of all, do me a big favor.  I'll do whatever favor you want.  No, no, no.  Let's talk.  I'm talking.  Let's talk.  Let's talk me?  Right.  Let's talk that person.  No guy says that.  Like, you allow...  Look, you were nice enough to go big pussy lips and go, yeah. 
[03:05:30]  Whatever.  So the erotic...  Let's go...  Strip it.  Let's go to the world a little bit.  Okay.  That Elaine, who might judge you...  Well, when you say stripper to me, I think like the girl that goes to the club every night.  Selling pussy, any of that.  Right.  But when you say stripper to me, I think like a girl that wears like booty shorts and goes  and dances on a strip pole.  I have $100,000 worth of costumes.  That is logistics.  Thank you for saying that, Patricia.  And, you know, I go in and I have choreographed stage shows.  It's kind of different.  The difference you're talking about is like...  I'm like a headliner.  Like, I get booked into a club like a headliner. 
[03:06:00]  Do you completely take all your clothes off?  Yes, I get naked on stage.  All right.  You're a stripper.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, I'm a stripper.  I don't have anything.  Hey, look at me.  I love strippers.  I love strippers.  And this is my way of trying to put...  I hate how people are romanticizing this shit.  Exactly.  I'm trying to say, look, you've been...  And there's nothing wrong with it if that's what you choose to do.  No, there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.  But I'm saying, I don't go to a specific club.  I go all over the country and do any different things.  You have to see...  You have to see...  There is a difference between being where this radio show is and being a college jock. 
[03:06:30]  Like, even though you're both technically in radio, if...  I'm only saying that that's how everybody looks at their gig.  Well, we're not...  But ultimately, you've seen Silence of the Lambs, right?  Yes, absolutely.  I actually want to fuck James Gumm in the dress.  The part where he goes, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You've been courteous.  It's attentive.  You've been...  You've been...  Like, up until this point, you know, you were honest about multiple Migs.  What did he say in the other room?  Right.  You know, hey, I want to come in your...  But then you get into this magic of making the stripping to be noble. 
[03:07:00]  So we're not belittling what you're saying, but it's like...  Are you going to let me respond?  Let me just say.  Okay.  Because it is on a different level because, I mean, I got Entertainer of the Year.  It's like the AVNs.  There's awards for what I do, whereas if you're a stripper, nobody's going to come and say,  ooh, you're the best stripper and get me an award.  Are you busting out six figures for your appearance?  Hell yeah.  That might be.  That's some dope shit.  And how do you get along with Aria and Jelena?  How do you get along with them bitches?  Who?  Aria, Jelena, Aria, you know, Bria. 
[03:07:30]  She doesn't notice the other girls in the magazine.  You don't know.  None of these are names of friends.  She doesn't notice any of them.  Oh, they're in a little world of fucking...  Wait, you said her name wrong.  She said my mood his bitch.  You said her name wrong.  There's a lot of girls.  I mean, you know what?  I haven't met a lot of them.  I've met Justine Jolie.  Love her.  I've met Shauna Lene.  Is it a friendly world in general?  I do.  I mean, it's world...  No, is the world friendly?  Is the world...  Is the world...  It can be catty.  I mean, it can be bitchy.  It can be catty.  I mean, it just depends on...  Certain girls, like, I don't let things get to me.  I've been in the business a long time.  A girl could come up to me and be like,  I think you're ugly. 
[03:08:00]  I don't think you deserve to pay the year.  I think you suck.  And I'd be like, okay, well, opinions are like assholes.  And what could I say to you that would really offend me?  What could you say to me?  And personally, I mean, in this world...  I don't get offended.  Like, porn stars, for some reason,  I learned that they like to be called...  Adult entertainers.  That's why we said what we said.  Or actresses.  Right, right.  And you go, you suck dick.  You're a porn star.  Enough.  You don't romanticize everything.  What?  But they get offended.  They get pissed off now.  I'm trying to get you to help me.  I don't get offended because everybody has a different... 
[03:08:30]  You know, like, I say feature entertainer,  you say stripper.  That's fine.  So how else can you make...  He was asking about money in the game,  meaning how else can you do it where  Penthouse doesn't care if you do it?  Like, all right, you can dance.  You can probably do certain softcore shoots.  Like, what are you allowed to do  where they won't freak out to make extra money  because you're pet of the year?  Well, I work for Penthouse exclusively.  So, I mean, as far as that,  I mean, like, I have a career as a feature entertainer  and they allow me to keep doing that,  which was nice because they could have said no, 
[03:09:00]  but they know that that was something  that I'd already established before.  That was actually one of their draws to me  was that I had a very good establishment  in the feature entertainment industry  and with clubs and club owners.  So I go all over the country.  And the feature entertainer, let me ask you this.  Go ahead.  Is this upgraded, at one point,  I was a, like, in the comedy game,  you're an opener, bringer, they call them,  then you're a feature middle act,  then you're a headliner.  Did you start off a stripper  and upgrade it to now what is a feature entertainer? 
[03:09:30]  Yes, I did.  I was a stripper for a long time,  for like three or four years.  And I loved it.  And what's the difference between stripping  and what you do now?  Because what I do now,  I make my money.  Like, if you get booked in a club to do comedy,  you don't have to get all the customers  to give you a dollar to make money.  They hire me to come in.  You're still a stripper.  It's okay.  I understand.  Because even, like, an open-miker  and, like, a headliner are comedians.  Are comedians.  Like, if you're playing Little League Baseball 
[03:10:00]  or Major League Baseball,  you're all baseball players.  He asked me what you're saying.  Oh, shit.  Yes, I did.  But he got a great point.  Thank you.  What he's saying is that  you're on the highest level  of stripping.  A stripper.  Absolutely.  Fair enough.  Fair enough.  You can't change what it is.  But then the strippers that work at the club  are going...  They're just in the minor leagues.  That's all.  I get free food at the club.  You're asking why it's interchangeable.  I get free food at the club.  But the opener has to pay for his. 
[03:10:30]  The middle gets 25% off.  That's right.  They pay for my parking.  The middle has to take the bus.  I couldn't do what I do  if it wasn't for strippers  because I go to their club  and I work at their place.  I mean, I love strippers.  But you don't have to...  No, I absolutely acknowledge strippers.  You don't have to rely  on the dollars of customers  because you're getting paid.  I get paid to go in there.  So I don't have to necessarily  do private dances  to make money.  I go in.  Every time I go on stage,  I get paid.  Here's what it'll be like.  You're at a high level.  Are you at the highest level?  I'm at the highest.  There's no house to go.  Her being called a stripper, 
[03:11:00]  this is how she...  You're looking at it like this.  You're looking at it like this.  Someone will get that.  If we walked into a club, right,  and someone said,  so how's the open mic stuff going?  You would go,  I'm not a fucking open micer,  motherfucker.  I'm a headliner.  And being called a stripper  is the...  I don't mind being called a stripper.  It doesn't insult me at all.  Not only because you're cool,  but I'm saying  it's almost...  That's the name  you call an open micer  on the taking your clothes off game. 
[03:11:30]  Yes.  An open micer is a stripper.  And if someone was saying...  What's right underneath feature?  A feature dancer?  What's the name?  When you're starting  to upgrade off stripper?  I don't know.  I think there's clubs  that have in-house girls  that'll do shows.  They'll be their strippers,  but they'll let them  do little shows and stuff  when they don't have features.  So I guess I never did that,  but maybe that's the next thing.  And lap dances, table...  That shit is done with you.  I mean, I can do it if I want.  If the money's right.  If somebody offers me  a bunch of money, I'll do it.  But I mean, it's not...  I don't have to rely on that 
[03:12:00]  to walk out of there with money  is what I'm saying.  You know what you're leaving with  before you get there.  Exactly.  I know what my paycheck is  before I walk through the door.  Then tips and dances  are just gravy.  And do Bunny Ranch places  try to get you to come  and say she's here this week?  I don't...  Do they try?  I've never had...  No.  Most of the clubs,  I do high upscale  gentlemen's clubs  that'll book a feature.  Like, not all clubs  book feature entertainment.  So it just depends on the venue.  Hmm.  So...  Yeah, but I...  If we walk...  And I'm one entertainer of the year,  so I'm the best feature  on the circus.  So not only am I a feature, 
[03:12:30]  I'm the best feature.  When you walk in as a comic,  if I walk into a radio station,  they go to me, so...  Can you only get that one year?  I'm sorry.  They say, like,  wait, why don't you do  some of your sketches?  It's like, even though  I know I'm the comic.  I did it.  I did it.  I mean, that to me is like,  even though they're not  trying to be fucked up,  I'm like, no,  I would clarify that.  They might go,  well, we're a comic.  We get it.  And I would go, no.  And is this it?  Can you get this...  Can you be the three-time  reigning champ of nudity?  Pet of the year, you mean?  Pet of the year's  a one-shot deal.  All the girls that were  a pet that year 
[03:13:00]  are in the running  for the pet of the year  for the next year.  So I was a 2008 pet.  Me and the other 11 girls  were all in the running for it.  So this is a wrap for you  in terms of this  ever happening again.  What happens to the pet  of the year  is after their reign is over.  Yeah, like what's going on?  I mean, different girls  do different things with it.  I mean...  They go back to stripping.  Maybe.  And what's your future,  what's your future, pumpkin?  What's going on  in terms of life after this?  There's lots of possibilities for me.  I mean, I have options,  you know,  to work with Penthouse 
[03:13:30]  on some different scales  because of the different,  you know,  the things in the club business  that I've, you know,  put myself out there with.  I can't really talk about it  because right now  I'm supposed to do  the pet of the year thing  and, you know,  and that's great.  But I'm saying I have  other things that I can do  with my connections  that I've made  over the course of my career.  Fair enough.  Got a boyfriend?  No, I do not.  Ooh, what happened there?  I just travel too much.  I can't really commit  to a boyfriend.  They're high maintenance.  Any text messaging friend  when you're in town?  You go, hey, how are you?  Oh, booty call?  Like little local booty calls, 
[03:14:00]  different cities I'm in.  Oh, yeah, you're into girls.  No, I kind of just  take care of it myself mostly.  Delicious.  So that's why I call her she.  Me and her are like  one-on-one right now.  She's my sidekick.  All right.  All right, all right.  And what happens  when you get the need  for a little guidance?  From a man?  Yeah.  I never get a little need  for a guidance from a man.  Really?  You don't need any...  I mean, don't get me wrong,  I enjoy it when it's there,  but I don't need it.  Just something a little like...  I mean, I'm not 13,  I'm not 23,  I'm older in the business,  so I know, you know. 
[03:14:30]  How old are you?  I'm 30.  Are you really?  Yes, I am.  Shit, baby.  I know.  That's Moses in the fucking strip game.  I know, isn't that great?  I'm so proud of myself.  You motherfuckers should be  coming down off a mountain  with some tablets.  I know, I know.  Fucking old bitch  coming to this motherfucker  acting 19 and you 30.  Great pussy hair  on that motherfucker.  I know, I know.  God damn, girl.  I love it.  I didn't realize  what you're hanging in there.  I am, I'm enjoying it.  You know what,  I'm so proud to be able  to say that,  because that is true,  that's the consensus.  How are you still working 
[03:15:00]  in the business?  You're like 80  in the strip club world, so.  We got David in studio, too,  so we thought this would be fun.  So we got the penthouse  pet of the year in studio,  and we got David,  who just came for the first time  with a woman.  Right, David?  This motherfucker here.  He's new, isn't he?  That's Joe.  Joe?  Yeah.  Old Joe?  Did you write down  your cock size yet, Joe?  Oh, yeah.  All right, good.  How are we going to prove  that they're not lying?  Sure, they could be.  We got to kind of,  you can prove it.  Other than that,  we have to take their fucking,  we have to take their word for that. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  Because if we're guessing  on how long they are,  then they could be lying.  This is David.  He just got his first.  Hi, David.  All right, nice to meet you.  Hi.  I heard all about  your skanky story.  What do you think of it?  I think that you're  a crazy fucker.  That's what I think.  Thank you.  I think you have a way  with the Asian women.  The Asian persuasion.  You enjoyed  the Yankee Cranky shop.  Definitely.  I enjoyed it.  Yeah.  It was pretty good.  At first,  I was a little disappointed,  but then it got better. 
[03:16:00]  Why were you disappointed?  Because a certain individual  was making a big deal  about the table shower,  and that's the best thing  you've got to get a table shower.  A certain individual?  What are you, an asshole?  Say Bobby Kelly,  you piece of shit.  Bobby was hyping it up,  and it wasn't shit.  A certain Mr. Bob Kelly  was hyping up the table shower,  and the table shower  was nothing.  But listen,  before you get all fucked up,  David,  there's a word called synergy.  Now, D.L. said this,  Bobby said this,  and Opie said that,  and together,  all of that ended up  with this wonderful story 
[03:16:30]  that we enjoyed.  Don't forget that.  Yeah.  Don't forget that.  We were all in on this thing.  Don't forget that  that table bath  was a part of your greatness.  A part of the cab fare  and everything else  that went on  to make for a pleasurable experience.  Don't be ungrateful,  you son of a bitch.  Hey, you motherfucker.  So, uh,  what else do we want  to ask David?  Are you going to make this  a regular thing now, David?  I don't know.  I mean...  Did your mommy and daddy  find out?  No, they didn't find out. 
[03:17:00]  Have you been back  to see this woman since?  No, it was just on Friday.  Oh.  Are you going to go back  to see her?  Is she your girlfriend now?  I don't know about that.  I would want to  if I could afford it.  I mean, it's kind of expensive.  What was the best part?  Besides, like,  the cumsees, I guess.  I mean, what was the best  part of the experience?  The cumsees?  Well, I understand that.  I understand that,  but I guess...  Yeah.  That's true.  You were hoping  the shower was going to be amazing.  I was hoping the shower was...  That sucked.  What was the best...  Oh, other than the cumsees. 
[03:17:30]  Yes, that's the obvious.  What would you do again  at a massage bottle  other than the cumsees?  What was the moment  where you're like,  holy crap, that's cool?  Well, the whole entire, like...  The tickling of the asshole, the...  The whole entire massage  was pretty incredible.  Like, the way she did  to perform the actual massage,  like, with the, you know,  the different points  on the body and the...  Was it pressure?  Pressure points.  Or was it bullshit?  It felt good?  Like, you felt relaxed after?  I did feel relaxed after, yeah.  It was.  The whole entire massage  was actually really good.  A real good experience.  Yeah.  He's going to be devastated  when she gets to be a sushi waitress. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, I know.  Hey, let me ask you...  I don't want to move too ahead,  but are you...  Do you...  Like, do you do it for fun anymore?  Do what for fun?  Take off your fucking clothes.  And, like...  I was just on some show  where there was a bunch of people  that were speaking Spanish.  I couldn't understand anybody,  so I just took my clothes off.  So, I mean...  Could you take them off here?  Yeah, I was wondering...  I don't know.  Then you'll call me a stripper  and make fun of me.  All right.  Stop.  Listen.  I'll be talking about him.  I'll put duct tape over my mouth.  Trust me.  No, you won't.  Well, I would say shit.  Well, this guy here, right? 
[03:18:30]  Just to say...  Because, you know...  He was turned on by a third world...  Hey, she might have been high.  A third world prisoner.  Now, you are a free old feature.  Mm-hmm.  And I want to see what his reaction will be...  Hell, yeah.  ...to a real live...  What we call our country...  Domesticated...  Fucking real...  Domesticated vagina?  Wait, is domesticated the right word?  I'm not a beautiful woman with big boobies. 
[03:19:00]  No, but...  We have to, like...  Do you want to see what an enormously huge...  No, wait, no.  There you go.  That's what...  Don't just yank him out, you animal.  Jesus.  Fucking face.  Hey, I got to take out my boobs.  Shut the fuck up.  Jeez, but I'm saying...  This is what I just do.  All Bronx dudes, they just go...  Fuck it, man.  Don't play games.  Just here.  Here's the twat.  But what do you want?  That's not true.  We want you to be 19 again...  And turn this...  Look at his face.  Look at his gorgeous little Jew face.  I think we're making him nervous.  Are you nervous?  That's what we're going for.  We want to see him jizz in his pants. 
[03:19:30]  Aww.  What do you think of her?  Yeah.  She's very nice.  Aww, he said it was very nice.  She's a beautiful woman.  David, why don't you ask?  How about...  We shut the fuck up and David, you ask to see her naked.  How would you do that?  I don't know.  Yeah, yeah, David.  Hey, David.  Look her in the eye.  Don't show him the naked picture first.  I've seen it already.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Yeah, you've seen it already. 
[03:20:00]  Oh, damn.  You've been eating steakums, my friend.  This is like...  This is the real deal.  What would you say to her?  Why don't you get her naked?  This is the fucking...  Porter house you're about to see.  Come on, David.  Help get her naked.  What would you say?  Come on, David.  Put down your questions that you prepared for her.  You prepared questions for me?  I certainly did.  Okay, no, no, no.  All right, you want to ask a few questions?  Let's do a couple of questions.  All right, a few questions.  I want to hear this.  This might get me horny.  Well, I want to get more back into the touring and the erotic dancing.  Okay, you go ahead.  Read me some of those questions. 
[03:20:30]  I'm just more curious about, like, what exactly, like, do you have, like, a certain routine  when you're on tour?  Like, do you practice and you rehearse a routine?  Absolutely.  I was actually a professional dancer before I ever started stripping.  Yes, I was a stripper.  I knew that would get to you.  It doesn't get to me.  I love strippers.  Let's be honest.  The fact that you think it goes to me is what gets to me.  That hurts you a little bit.  You think I just started doing this thing?  No, it doesn't.  That hurts you.  No, it doesn't.  A little bit.  No, it doesn't.  You didn't like that little stripper.  No, no, no.  You worked hard to be called a feature dancer.  I did work hard, but that doesn't, let me put it this way. 
[03:21:00]  If I had never been a stripper, I would have never thought to try to be a feature.  People in the real world that are outside of the adult entertainment don't understand  what a feature is.  Oh, you know what?  What if underneath stripper the name is called stank poling?  I'd be like, okay.  Like, girls will stink up the pole.  Like, I'm not no stank poler.  Let's go back to.  Then I probably wouldn't go near a pole ever again, but still.  Let's go back to.  Like, if that had been the allure from the beginning, I'd probably have been a feature dancer.  Probably wouldn't have gone after it.  Let's go back to David.  David.  Yeah, go ahead.  Ask me when you're concerned.  No, so I'll continue. 
[03:21:30]  I'm curious about, like, the touring and dick.  Do you have a specific routine?  Yeah, I have.  Why don't you ask her what airline she flies?  I'm like, oh, boy.  Get to the better questions.  Yeah, read me some of that questions.  I'm curious about that.  So what's on your rider?  Crackers or cookies?  No one gives a shit.  Do you come to this radio show often?  He's going to ask me what's on my iPod next.  Okay, go ahead.  Read me some of that.  I don't know about, like, do you have a routine?  Yeah, I have a nurse.  Let me just explain it to him so we can move on.  Yeah, it's like the Marx Brothers.  Okay, like, I have different theme shows.  Like, one show I might come out, like, is a gangster. 
[03:22:00]  Another show I might come out, like, a burlesque, like, Marilyn Monroe type of outfit.  So I have different theme shows that have music that coordinate.  Yes, it's all very burlesque and sexy and fun.  And move on to some more graphic questions.  David has theme shows, too.  Sometimes he comes out like a boring interviewer.  I have a general knowledge question.  Go ahead, David.  Whatever you want to ask her.  Um, I've read on a couple websites that you consider yourself an actress.  Is that true?  That I consider myself an actress?  Do you consider yourself an actress?  Um, I'm acting right now. 
[03:22:30]  Okay.  Ooh.  No, I don't consider myself.  Do I consider myself an actress?  Are you going to read on something like your website or your MySpace?  I have acted before, yes.  What kind of acting have you done?  When I'm acting, I consider myself an actress.  You haven't seen Alien Killers 5 on SyFy.  No, I've done, like, a lot of Broadway stuff.  You've done Broadway?  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here!  Will you stop with your bullshit?  What, Broadway?  I've done Damn Yankees.  I'm a singer.  I actually went to school for musical theater.  Wait, what did you do?  I went to college for musical theater. 
[03:23:00]  What did you do for Damn Yankees, baby?  Excuse me?  What did you do for Damn Yankees?  That's why I was curious, because it said on your website you were an actress, and I didn't  see any, like, credits.  On my website?  Like, on your website you said I'm an actress or this?  There's nothing on my website that says I'm an actress.  Or somewhere I read that you consider yourself an actress.  Well, you'll probably read a lot of stuff somewhere about me.  Can I ask you what you did for Damn Yankees?  IMDB.  Yeah, I was Lola in Damn Yankees.  Is that a big part?  I really don't know.  It is a big part.  Evil Force 12.  It was on at 5.30 in the morning.  I was the girl that screamed really loud when that monster was eating my vagina.  Patrice, it was on Sci-Fi 3. 
[03:23:30]  Kinky Kong on Cinemax 4.  Like, the guys were asking you beforehand, like, when you're done with Pet of the Year,  what would you do afterwards?  Like, would you consider, like, going back into, like, full-time, like, acting or singing?  Very good question, David.  Um, yeah, I've always, you know, sang and been an actress.  I've actually, you know...  Yeah, you're interesting.  Like, I read that you once recorded a demo CD.  Yeah, I'm in a band with my dad.  Right, your dad.  I read about that, yeah.  Yeah.  What do you exactly, do you sing, like, country music?  Or what's the other singing?  Um, a lot of, like, I call it organic music, like, Natalie Merchant, Bonnie Raitt type stuff, 
[03:24:00]  that kind of thing.  Can you sing something for us today?  Sure.  If you want.  How do we do that?  Get music and she goes.  No, I don't know if we have the music, that's all.  I can just sing it.  What do you sing?  All right, let's, David, ask her to sing her something.  Yeah, what do you sing when you're with your dad?  Like, what do you and your dad sing together?  Well, I mean, I could do, like, a Bonnie Raitt or something if you want.  Sure.  Okay.  And can you do it?  Can you do it to him?  Yeah.  Do a little, give him something to talk about, but just, just for him.  Yeah, have a nipple slip or something.  Oh, I can't.  I don't make my music with my nakedness.  I'm either going to get naked or I'm going to sing or I'll do them apart from each other. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, can you just turn on this boy?  Just multitask.  I can.  Of course I can.  Do it for her.  Just turn this boy on.  Let me get a good look at this girl.  All right, here we go, David.  She's going to sing for you.  Okay.  Oh, let me look at this.  I'm not acting right now.  Oh, pull it off the thing, beautiful.  Use his?  No, pull that off.  No, that won't stretch.  Use his.  Oh, okay.  Damn.  All right, here we go, David.  This is for you.  She can sing.  Well, I don't know.  If I start singing, are you guys going to make fun of me?  Because that would be hot. 
[03:25:00]  No, we wouldn't do that.  Okay.  And stop your prepared for abuse shit.  Yeah.  I'm always prepared for abuse.  As a woman, it's just a prerequisite.  We're on your side, bitch.  If you want your vagina to come out, you have to be prepared for abuse.  If you're trying to have personality all the time, just stop it.  I have personality for miles.  Where would you, you sexy motherfucker?  Look at that.  That's right.  Oh, God.  Here we go.  I bet it smells like hope.  Okay, I'm going to sing for him.  Go ahead.  It smells like what?  Hope.  I don't know.  I bet it smells like freedom if we're 16, 19.  He can tell you what it smells like here in a minute.  Oh!  All right, here we go.  Was that an actress? 
[03:25:30]  No, that's good, baby.  Was that good acting?  I'm telling you.  All right, let's do some stuff.  Okay.  People are talking, talking about people.  I hear them whisper.  You won't believe it.  They think we're lovers.  Kept undercover.  I'll just ignore it.  But they keep saying we love just a little too loud.  Stand just a little too close. 
[03:26:00]  Don't look at me, you motherfucker.  Look at that deliciousness.  We stand just a little too long.  This is going great.  Maybe they're seeing something we don't do.  Then let's give them something to talk about.  Rub your own nipple, Dave.  Let's give them something to talk about.  Look, I'm trying to be cool.  Let's give them something to talk about.  How about the love, love, love? 
[03:26:30]  That's all I'm going to do.  That's right.  That's all right.  Yeah.  Don't try to sit there and be cool David Carradine face.  I mean, not you.  What's the head nerd from The Drins of the Nerd?  Oh, Carradine.  Something Carradine.  Stop it.  I like him.  That was great.  That was fucking great, baby.  That was really good.  Yeah.  That was really good.  I'm really tired.  You are multi, multi-talented.  Thank you.  Very good.  Yeah.  You don't have to make excuses.  You did fine.  No, but I'm saying I can do better if you guys give me some time or something. 
[03:27:00]  It was fun.  If you guys are enjoying it, then that's all that matters.  That was fantastic.  It was great.  Thank you.  Yes, it was.  See, look at him.  He was over there.  Damn it.  I wanted to dog her out.  Okay.  Ask me another one of those questions with the stars by it.  He's got one bit of stars.  Stop it.  You better be nuts.  Leave this young lady alone.  She's a beautiful young lady.  Look, he's like kicked back.  He doesn't like me.  No, it's not about you.  What can I do to make you like me?  I like you.  You're such a liar.  It's because you're married.  You're all right.  Married guys never like me. 
[03:27:30]  It's okay.  Go ahead.  Yeah, that's it.  David, continue with the interview.  Okay.  I'm asking.  I want to know why you don't like me.  You're not being honest.  The stripping thing bothered me.  I am being honest.  But that's fine.  It's all good.  You're beautiful, and David's going to ask more questions.  Okay, David.  I just want to get into nowhere a little bit more.  So I'm curious about what you do on your free time.  You're a huge sports fan, I read.  Hello, the Pittsburgh Steelers.  We just clinched our division last night, baby.  I heard about that, but I'm interested to know what makes you a Steelers fan.  If you're from Ohio, shouldn't you be a Browns fan? 
[03:28:00]  My family's from Pennsylvania.  My family's from Pennsylvania.  So I grew up with Pennsylvania fan parents and family.  Oh, okay.  I got it.  I didn't realize I was supposed to like the Browns until I was in high school.  And then I was like, oh, crap.  I guess I'm supposed to like the Browns.  Are you from Cleveland?  I'm from Columbus.  The fucking Ohio girls.  I'm telling you, the best vaginas, honest to God, are all out of that part of the country.  I've never got lucky in that part of the country.  Cleveland?  I have a good bad guy ever in Cleveland.  It's fucking amazing.  That's not surprising.  I actually grew up in Marion, Ohio. 
[03:28:30]  Nobody ever knows.  If you had to eat.  You live in Delaware, Ohio?  If you had to hunt.  Delaware, Ohio?  Yes.  Or Boston.  What is it like there in Delaware?  Delaware, Ohio.  It's very small.  There's nothing.  I think we have a Walmart.  So that's what I'm wondering about.  We have a Walmart.  What's your big success and all the money that you make?  Why did you stay in a small little town?  Why didn't you branch on to the big city life?  Because I travel.  I mean, I can.  Everyone is like, what, five hours away from anyone else in this country by plane.  So, I mean, I travel all over the place.  And when I'm home, I'm away from all of that.  How often do you actually get to like just relax at home and do whatever you want to at home? 
[03:29:00]  Do you ever have free time?  Yeah, I have about maybe a week off a month if I'm lucky.  David, how about some sex questions?  Jesus.  But you really are just fucking balance.  You're like Charlie Rollins.  I feel like I'm on a first date right now.  She's not going to date yet.  I'm very nervous.  I'm just curious.  I don't know.  Ask her about her boobies and stuff.  She's a very feisty girl, man.  We tested out.  She can take it.  She can take it.  So, go ahead.  Just say, listen, when you're at home having your fucking horrible thoughts of murder,  what do you want to say to a beautiful young lady like that? 
[03:29:30]  Like something dirty.  She's a soldier, David.  Say something sexy or dirty or any kind of sex question.  Let's go.  Something, David.  All right.  I knew you guys.  Have you prepared a couple of questions like that?  Deep in your heart.  Come on, man.  All right.  You prepared some of those.  How many questions did he prepare?  He does a lot.  I love it.  I think it's adorable.  Come on, David.  So, if you're in this whole like industry, like with the sex industry, did you ever think  of like branching out into more like sexual like porn, like pornographic videos?  That's your sex question?  That's your fucking sex question?  How dare you?  She would never go into that.  It's obvious.  I'm asking.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:30:00]  I'm just asking.  How about I'd like to choke on your clit?  Just say it.  No.  Just say it.  Well, let her answer the question.  Answer that question.  Oh, no.  You're not allowed to fudge him a question.  But I still want to, now I want him to read it.  What's that little post-it?  Give it to me.  I'll read it.  I'll read the question.  Jesus Christ.  Way to go, Erock.  Can you motorboat me with your tit?  Way to go, Erock.  He doesn't even know what a fucking motorboat is.  Do you know what a motorboat is, David? 
[03:30:30]  He would be, I want you to read this to me.  I want to hear him say it to me because that's hot.  David, read it in a way.  Read it really in your sexy voice.  Like if we were having sex, I want you to read it to me in your sex voice.  All right.  Go ahead.  Don't be scared.  Taya, can you motorboat me with your tits?  He looked at you and he said it.  You have to look at me and say it again.  He's scared to look at women.  No.  No, he's not.  Look her in the eyes.  Look me in the eyes and say it.  God, there is a, I know there's 10 women. 
[03:31:00]  Can you motorboat me with your tits?  Absolutely.  That's why you checked the Hudson River.  Wait, you said absolutely?  Well, I'll get naked for him.  All right, let's get, let's get her naked for her.  That's fucking sexy, man.  And to David, yeah.  All right.  See, he can.  David, ask her to get naked, will you?  Say, Taya, will you get naked for me?  Taya.  What, darling?  Will you get naked for me?  Yes, I will.  And then, but here's the thing, though.  When we get trying to really get in the pussy, here, practice shit like this.  Man, just take them drawers off, you goofy bitch.  Just try it. 
[03:31:30]  Talk to her, David.  What do you want to say?  Just fucking be dirty for a second.  Be dirty.  What do you want to say?  She controls any room that she goes into, right?  Absolutely.  She's so fed up with guys doing what she's told.  Take your, take those dirty panties off, you fucking animal.  Just say it.  Have you been speaking to my ex-boyfriend?  There you go.  I know they talk to you like you hate shit because their self-esteem's low.  I'm just saying that.  I wouldn't talk to you like that, pumpkin.  All right.  Oh, baby.  Wait, Patrice, Patrice.  I wanted to get David interacting with this. 
[03:32:00]  I'm just so glad.  David, now talk to her.  Tell her what you want to see on her.  Come on.  Would you get naked?  More than that.  Look, he wants me to get naked.  Maybe if I get naked, he'll be motivated to do that.  Maybe he'll talk if you're naked.  Yeah, let me get naked.  All right.  All right.  You know what?  You're onto something.  He can talk to me while I'm getting naked.  Maybe he can be like, ooh, I like it.  Describe what you're seeing to everybody when she gets naked.  Yeah, because we are on the radio.  They can't see me naked just to you.  Right, of course.  You have to explain it.  Taya Parker, right? 
[03:32:30]  Yes, Taya.  Taya Parker.  In some parts of the country, I'm known as Trailer Parker, but don't tell people that.  You liked that, didn't you?  No.  Look, he's like, yeah, she won't call herself a stripper, but she's from the Trailer Park.  And look at this little trailer.  I mean, trailer.  Traitor.  I see you.  I see you, double agent.  Is that what I think it is in the front?  Oh, no, sorry.  All right.  You know what I thought it was?  What did you say?  I thought it was a bunny.  Oh, hell no.  Hell no.  This was a very big mistake when I was 18.  Once I reached the age of reason, I was...  Yeah, but you can get that removed, can't you?  What is it a tattoo of? 
[03:33:00]  Too many scars.  It's actually a hummingbird, and I drew it when I was like 16, and it's symbolic of my parents.  So I would leave it alone, but I wouldn't get any of it.  But it's not in the chute, though.  I don't see it.  They airbrush it off?  They do.  They take it out.  And I ask them to, because, you know...  Jeez.  How fucking...  I'm sorry I'm not doing this sexy.  There's nothing sexy that takes me to take it off.  It's okay.  That's the best way with dirt bags.  Just take that shit off.  Just take her jeans off.  Take it off like you're a fucking concentration camp.  She's fucking...  All right, she's...  David, you're supposed to be describing this, not us. 
[03:33:30]  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead, David.  Sorry about that.  We don't have video today, so tell the people what they're seeing.  I can't see.  She took her shoes off.  She took her pants off.  She took her shirt off.  Oh, her ass is amazing.  And now she is dancing around for us a little bit.  Look at her ass, David.  It's amazing.  Her ass is amazing.  You really painted a picture, David.  She is putting her ass in my face right now.  May I spank you?  Yes, you can.  Oh, my God.  I don't think it was it.  It's okay.  He didn't have a good trajectory on it. 
[03:34:00]  David, spank her like you mean it.  Sorry, David.  She's a soldier.  Wait, David.  Jesus, David.  Oh, she's just a fucking piece of garbage.  I love her, man.  He hit her all awkward and hard, too.  That was delicious.  Hold on.  Hold on.  We got to get the mic to find.  Wait, wait, wait.  Listen to me for a second.  Jimmy will show you, David, how you spank a girl's ass.  I don't know if she...  Who?  Hey.  Will you let Jimmy?  Jimmy knows how to spank girls properly.  I thought you were talking about him, and he scares me.  I don't think I'm going to spank him.  Why does Patrice scare you?  Because he's a big black guy?  Because she knows I ain't fucking around with that fucking goofy little white ass. 
[03:34:30]  I'll get revenge for slavery.  All the way across the room.  I'll be flying into you here in a second.  All right.  She fucking knows the deal.  You don't.  Come here.  All right.  David's just going to learn from Jimmy.  Again, I only spank how I like it.  They may not like it.  Girls like different things.  You have to caress it first.  You give it like a little caress like that because it feels really good.  Then you just kind of swat it.  You don't do it too hard.  Not too hard.  Just like that.  Can you do my technique for me, Jim?  What's that?  Jim's is on the ass from a right to left style.  Sometimes.  Or left or right. 
[03:35:00]  Mine's is a where the thigh and the ass.  I'll come over and you can show it.  All right.  Patrice gets it.  Somebody please.  She agreed to this.  You don't do it too hard.  You find out where the booty makes its move.  Look, he's making my booty.  Yeah, you do that first.  Well, the booty doesn't bounce that much.  It's not that.  It's quite tight there.  When you make the thing.  That's a 30-year-old brawn.  Yeah.  And then, wait a minute.  You got to get.  It's, it's, you know, it's.  And it moves. 
[03:35:30]  She doesn't like it as much as Jimmy.  That's more.  I've never had anybody say something like that before.  She doesn't like it.  But, dude, I'm trying to be nice.  I understand.  You don't want to do it too hard.  You come back so David can do it.  When Jimmy spanked her, there was an ooh that came from.  You don't start too hard.  You can't start too.  It's just light.  And also, that's the black guy's style of smacking the ass, too, by the way.  Because you always have to rub first nicely.  It's like a little, like you just kind of.  Like a Mr. Miyagi.  Yeah, you start like that.  And then you start like.  Good man.  Is that you still? 
[03:36:00]  Still man.  I was like, that last one was good.  I thought it was him.  Nah, it ain't going to be good.  She's a soldier, too.  I'm a soldier.  It's like really soft and you caress.  Because then you get like that.  And some people.  I got spanked recently.  And I'm not big on being spanked.  Like, I just kind of swat a little bit like I'm slapping the face.  Do you like to be spanked?  Do you, David?  She's asking a question.  Do you like to be spanked?  Get on mic, David.  You should be spanking or not.  Okay, I think I might want to spank David.  Oh, David.  This is not about.  Oh, Jesus.  Spank a little bit.  Spank a little bit.  Do like I was just doing.  It's not about me.  David, get off. 
[03:36:30]  It's an ass.  You can rub.  It's okay.  Grab your mic.  Get up.  Someone work the mic with David, please.  Don't hit the small of her back, David.  That's all.  No, she just moved her foot to the left.  It's all palms.  David.  Poor David.  David, you're doing it wrong.  And you use your fingertips, David.  How am I doing it wrong?  Caress the hiney softly.  Caress.  Because it's about the sensation.  Here we go.  Like this.  Rub.  Oh, Jesus.  You got cold.  I swear to God, she must feel like this is a Quincy episode. 
[03:37:00]  And Tate, can I ask you a quick question, please?  Yes, yes.  Before you do this, quick question.  Okay.  We're doing our style, our control freak style, right?  Right.  What actually is the style of ass slapping that you really like?  It depends on the sex, I guess.  Like if I'm like really going at it and we're fucking like dogs, then you can spank me as  hard as you want.  But if it's like just like a playful, like getting going type of thing, he's got it.  He's got it.  Jimmy's got it.  There you go, Jimmy.  He knows what he's doing.  This man's a veteran.  There you go. 
[03:37:30]  You said spank as hard as you want, right?  If I'm in the throes of fucking, then you can hit me as hard as you want.  E-Rock once spanked Justine Jolie and it might have been a little too hard.  Who?  You?  Yeah.  You're a friend, Justine Jolie.  I love her.  You might want to look that up online.  It was quite the day.  I love her.  Love her.  Yeah, you have to.  No, we like her a lot, actually.  I think she's great.  And you should caress it.  You caress it nicely.  You're so awkward.  You're caressing it with your fingertips.  You just got to be natural.  Just touch it softly like you'd want to.  Caress it and spank her in between. 
[03:38:00]  That wasn't bad.  All right, now do that one.  Do both.  What are you doing?  It was more like on the side of my butt, but that's okay.  That one wasn't bad.  He's doing better.  I think it's a practice thing.  You got to put your finger in her fart box.  Do both.  I'm going to steal that, totally.  That's great.  Don't just stop.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, I think his mule's getting there, too.  I think he's getting there.  That was good.  Oh, look at him.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, Jesus. 
[03:38:30]  Is he popping it?  Jimmy, is he popping it?  I don't know.  Oh, it's in his pocket.  It's going to the back.  It's going to the back.  I don't know.  David, are you popping it?  David, are you popping it?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You like your hair popping?  You got to pull the hair a little bit.  Hold on.  Everyone's talking at the same time.  Let me get control.  David just admitted that he's popping a little bit.  Oh, he's filling up, dude.  All right, you get to pull her hair now.  Pull her hair.  Don't go hard.  Pull her hair.  Pull the hair and spank. 
[03:39:00]  You don't have extensions or anything, right?  Because he'll pull them right out.  No.  All right.  She'll pull the hair.  Norton, show him how to tell him.  No, I want to see him do it first.  Okay.  And then see if it's right or wrong.  You can see his form, and then he can correct him.  Okay, go ahead.  Just do it naturally.  Pull her hair.  Grab the hair.  No, not like...  Hold on.  No.  He just pulled...  This is a serial killer.  It's very awesome murders that's going to happen.  Nurses in retarded hospitals have been...  You're talking about picnic basket.  I think we are creating a monster here.  I honestly do.  This might not be fun.  Grab the top of the head. 
[03:39:30]  You have to grab it.  Can I do this?  Go ahead.  This is how I would do it.  She may or may not like that.  You always go close to the head.  Like that.  You almost want to loop your fingers in and kind of grab it like that.  There you go.  So you can almost feel the top of your hands.  Feel my hands.  I don't know how to feel my hands.  It's touching her skull.  This way you're not going to pull too much hair.  And then you realize what that does.  It just doesn't...  It's like laying on a bed of nails.  It's like you lay on one, it's going to hurt.  So don't...  You pull them all together like it's her head.  And don't...  Here, give me him. 
[03:40:00]  Give me him.  Reach in.  Caress your scalp a little bit like that and separate it so you're not being clumsy and  sloppy.  David, part her hair.  It's her hair.  It's okay.  It's not a cancer wig.  It's not a cancer wig.  He's going to have...  He's going to end up with...  He's going to end up with clumps of hair.  He's going to...  What happened, Iraq?  He's trying to get her hair and then he just kind of palms her ass and goes...  He just like shoves it.  Oh, this poor kid.  You guys are putting too much pressure on him.  No, we're not.  There's no pressure.  There's no pressure.  He's actually helping. 
[03:40:30]  David, wait a minute.  He's going to pull out clumps of her hair.  Norton, I mean, David, just enjoy the fact that this is happening.  I'm enjoying.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm not even making you pay me.  Yeah, exactly.  Most guys have to spend some cash to get this.  Yeah, this costs bucks, brother.  I'm enjoying it.  Like that?  He's massaging my head.  No, David, you put your hand up like this.  You kind of go up the back of the head like that.  You palm the head very lightly and then you just pull away and as you're pulling away,  you grab a little bit of hair.  If that's what she likes.  It's not too hard, but you can control her that way.  Okay.  Yeah, control me.  And David's like, when can I punch her in the temple? 
[03:41:00]  Yeah.  And start to stall her fingers off.  Yeah, you can do it more.  You're doing it towards the side.  Like, get up under in the middle.  He's grabbing her hair like he's a subway door closing.  And she's going to be dragged to death.  He's going to trash.  Look at the hope he's left.  Jesus.  Fuck.  He's just awful.  This is so real.  He's uncomfortable in his skin, this kid.  And are you a lefty or a righty?  Righty.  Really?  So you grab with your left hand, you fucking asshole.  We can smack lefty.  Are you an ambidextrous ass-slapper? 
[03:41:30]  No.  Jim Abbott would be better at this.  Jim Abbott.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, just grab.  Like, put your hand up and grab.  Like, don't do this, or you're going to just...  There you go.  Is that good?  What's he doing wrong?  No.  That's good.  He's like Otto and George right now, the way he's working her hair.  Oh, God damn it.  Is that good?  Is that good?  Jesus.  Grab it and then spank.  Don't keep with the head.  Get it.  Grab, spank.  Grab it.  Hold the spank.  It's like three motions.  Grab, spank.  Wait, did you see him grit? 
[03:42:00]  Oh, Jesus.  Did you see his gritted teeth?  He gritted his teeth.  Oh, that's right.  Did you grit your teeth?  It has to be a little anger.  I gotcha.  Yeah, a little bit of anger involved in that.  Wait, that's the side.  You got to get the back.  You don't do that happy.  Hey.  Oh, no.  He's improving.  Did you see that face?  Yeah.  Do it, David.  I can't see his face.  Jesus Christ.  How about less anger in the face?  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  You're creeping us all out.  Oh, my God.  Less anger in the face.  Oh, boy.  Okay.  There you go.  You're not holding the hair right.  You just keep letting the hair.  David, you want to see her boobies? 
[03:42:30]  I would like to.  All right, then ask her.  Wow, your ass is really red.  Is it?  She's all right?  I apologize.  Taya Parker, Penthouse Pet of the Year, in studio.  Look at Bianchi.  I have to say her ass feels really nice.  And for me, at a safe court distance, I got to see that giant twat before you get out  of here.  Just a peek.  Oh, come on.  Are you going to make fun of it?  No.  We said I love you.  Now you guys are making me all embarrassed.  No, we're not.  It's beautiful.  Stop playing.  All right, Dave, ask her.  Ask her to see the boobies.  I'm going to just sit over here, actually.  This chair is not stable.  Come over here. 
[03:43:00]  All right, David, ask to see the boobies, please.  You have to ask.  David's balls are too heavy for him to get out the chair.  By the way, I got to admit, I was wrong.  She's totally proven that she's not a stripper.  What?  Get over it.  He's so worried about the stripper thing.  It's killing me.  No one, would you?  I am a stripper, okay?  All right, good.  All right, now we can all get along really good.  She's got a very...  Would you?  Oh, yes, I would.  There's no wiggle to the ass whatsoever. 
[03:43:30]  Fucking perfect.  I'm going to do something really fast.  It feels good.  But you know what?  The haggardness is so sexy.  That hair felt good to fucking grab.  She's a good girl.  She really turned me on.  All right.  The haggardness.  Tell you, how tall are you?  She's just...  5'3".  5'0".  Are you only 5'0"?  5'0".  Yeah.  Brunette.  She's dark eyes.  She's really on the cusp of retirement age in her game.  That's why I always leave my shoes.  Absolutely.  And she's just an old school gangster.  Are you ready?  Absolutely.  Trailer park trash.  She's so sexy. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's not a stripper move.  Oh, look at that.  She's right now got her pussy right up by David's face.  Oh.  And she's doing the Exorcist Spider-Man walk right in his lap.  She's doing backwards push-ups with her pussy in David's face.  That was hot.  Very 80s strip scene.  Yes, it was.  Yeah.  Oh, my goodness.  She's going for the bra.  Your breasts.  What'd you mind showing me?  And she wears a three-hook big titty bra, too.  I do.  I have to support those girls.  Oh, my God.  Girls.  There you go.  There you go, David.  What do you think? 
[03:44:30]  Would that be okay with you?  Hey, Taya, where'd it go in at?  The nipple or underneath where?  Underarms?  Um, underneath.  Underneath.  Delicious.  Delicious.  He just molested her breasts.  And she had it.  Wait, wait.  Let him do an official motorboat.  David, I can tell you he's nervous.  Go ahead.  David, do a motorboat, will you?  Can you lick him?  I put these Christmas ornaments on my boobs at the last place.  So I have, like, whatever.  Taya.  Oh, my goodness.  Go ahead.  Motorboat.  You know what a mohi don't know what it is.  No.  I can't do a mohi. 
[03:45:00]  Okay.  E-Rock, make him do it, please.  Don't be nervous.  Go ahead.  I don't want to do a mohi.  Do it.  Do it.  Do it, you homo.  Oh, my goodness.  This fucking kid.  He's not even hitting her tits.  He's just touching her breastplate.  Oh, look at this kid.  Jesus, that was an awful.  That was a rowboat.  God, I wish I was him.  That's what's getting me.  I wish I was him.  There's nothing in my body.  I have nothing.  I'm a fucking piece of shit.  What do you want me to do?  She's being so, she's being such a trooper. 
[03:45:30]  I am.  They always are.  I love educating.  It's important that we educate our young men.  Yeah.  Okay, I don't know what else to do.  Make them smell something.  Yeah, put your, put your, just, oh, God.  But pull it, hey, Taya, pull it to the side, baby.  Let them smell it.  Pull it to the side.  Just let them get a real, yes.  There you go.  Oh, yes.  I need David's face.  I am actually jealous.  Oh, David, look at that.  Let's ask David.  No, you have to do this.  You have to do a sniff like this.  Oh, he's in rigor mortis. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, fuck me.  Wait, I want to hear him.  Go ahead, David.  Oh, he doesn't even know.  What does it smell like, David?  It smells like almost.  What does it smell like?  It's very nice.  What does it smell like, though?  It smells like almost old.  It does not.  No, it does not, no.  Oh, what does it smell like, David?  It does not.  It smells good, I know.  Describe it.  Grandma's closet.  It smells very good.  Thank you.  Very good.  It smells like a dry, clean sweater.  I want to see it.  Oh, my God.  You are a soldier.  Hold on, hold on.  I'm very proud to be in your presence.  David, what did it smell like? 
[03:46:30]  Come on.  This radio, you're learning how to do radio, remember?  It just smelled, I don't know, it smelled very nice.  It was nice.  Like, what can you say it smelled like?  Oh, my God, his eyes are rolling up in the back of his head.  I don't know, it was nice and clean and fresh smelling.  Look what you did to him.  I can take the anger.  I don't think he can take the anger.  Look at that.  We need to have, like, a psychologist in here to find out what your anger issues against strippers are.  Will you stop focusing on this angry man?  I don't like that he doesn't like me.  I don't want to know what I can do to make him like me. 
[03:47:00]  You want everyone to like, and this is the great thing.  Not everyone's going to like you.  You know that.  Man, you got to go good.  But most of the people that don't like me have a reason not to like me.  I don't know, I think it's because.  Like I took their job or something.  I got to take your job.  I think, I'll tell you why.  I think because you're, like, just playing a role and it bothers me.  You're not, like, just talking.  Yes, I am.  What do you want to talk about?  I don't know.  You're talking about your girls and me and she.  But that's how I talk.  No, I don't think so.  But let's be fair.  I think you're playing a role.  Let me ask you this, though.  Let's be fair.  Am I right or wrong?  I don't know.  Let me ask you.  No, you're not wrong because you feel how you feel. 
[03:47:30]  You feel how you feel.  It's not wrong.  Let me ask you, though.  Is the fact is, okay, in our game, the comedy game.  Right.  If I, I know you very well doing the show, Norton, everybody.  If I go to 40 stations, I got a thing that I do.  And I think, ultimately, she may have been in here doing what she's doing.  But I think, ultimately, she's turning into who she is.  But she came in with the thing that she has to do because she's on the road.  She's the pet of the year.  She's going to be here. 
[03:48:00]  But not everybody's like you on the radio.  You want to know what I think it is?  I think that he's asked me a lot of questions that I've been asked before.  So maybe my answers just seem like they're rehearsed.  Oh, shit.  I ask the same questions on the radio, guys.  No, no, no.  Not on the radio, guys.  I get a lot of the same questions.  No, I'm saying I get a lot of the same questions.  Like, what does pet of the year mean?  What do you do?  What else do you do?  I mean, those are very typical introductory type questions.  Is that people, because you might, everybody might have your attitude.  All right, I'll ask you.  Is she just asking these pet questions? 
[03:48:30]  How about this?  Have you ever hooked?  Or would you hook in the future?  No, I would not.  What if someone was going to offer you ridiculous money?  I've been offered ridiculous money.  Because we know a lot of girls.  We've had a lot of girls come in here, and they do that on the side.  We say this.  You don't do privates.  No, no, I don't.  Would you consider that, though?  No, I wouldn't.  And I'll tell you why.  She's five more years from retirement, though.  So, ask her five more years when life is over.  No, I won't.  It's the same reason why I've never crossed over into porn.  I mean, the thing that you guys have to understand. 
[03:49:00]  No, I just don't.  I mean, the thing you guys have to understand about me, I mean, my parents have been married  for like 38 years.  So, you're talking more real now, by the way.  Right, but I'm saying, I come from a family that's not typical for girls that do what I  do.  Like, I love being naked.  I have no problem taking naked pictures.  I'm very confident in myself and in my body.  But there are a lot of things I will not do because of the way I was raised.  You know what I mean?  Like, I don't mind.  Let's be honest, too.  I don't mind that I've given my dad 200 heart attacks. 
[03:49:30]  I just don't want to kill him.  Let's be honest, too.  And the things you're trying to protect.  You used that line before.  You was growing up a little racist when you told you.  Growing up what?  A little racist.  Absolutely not.  Be honest.  I swear.  Never been with a black guy.  I haven't, but that's not.  Black guys are unattractive.  That's not racist.  You're just a good Christian girl.  No, no.  Let's be honest.  Even though I'm not saying you didn't grow up saying nigga or nothing, but I bet you  grew up with your father.  To some degree, you broke his heart.  But to some degree, to hold on to a little bit of daddy loves me shit, you ain't fucking 
[03:50:00]  with no nigga.  Tell the truth.  No black man's ever tried to have sex with me.  You're lying, bitch.  I would love to stick my thumb in your booty hole.  You would never let me, you motherfucker.  I've never, I've never had a black man approach me in a sexual way.  Never.  Not even once.  Because you know what?  He doesn't believe it.  Because I'm small and I have a little butt and I just don't think black guys are attracted  to me.  Come on, stop.  I swear to God.  Stop what you're saying.  I swear to God.  Stop what you're saying.  There's got to be some black guys out there that like just a small ass. 
[03:50:30]  But I'm saying, I don't know.  So ultimately, if that never happened, here's what you should have been doing.  Here's what you should have been doing.  What?  Even though, these hands should have been on those tiny butt cheeks just for you to  know what it felt like.  But you fucking, I can tell.  I'm not calling you racist.  I'm joking with you.  I know.  But you don't fuck with niggas.  I know that.  I've never had one ask me.  I swear to God.  I've never had one ask me.  You've heard all the questions and we were asking the same questions.  So the listeners, you know, they're coming up with their own questions.  There's Stephen S. from Bayshore.  You'll answer anything, right? 
[03:51:00]  He writes, after all the anals you've had, when you fart, is there a lot of corn?  I've actually never had anal sex.  All right.  There you go.  Why not?  I guess I've just never been with a guy that I wanted to have anal sex with.  And penthouse doesn't show penetration.  No, it doesn't show the asshole.  Yeah, they do.  I don't think they do.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  You don't have any asshole pictures.  You don't have no asshole pictures. 
[03:51:30]  No.  Like no complete.  Oh, okay.  You know.  Why not anal sex?  I just never have.  Scared of it?  No, I'm not scared of it.  I just never have.  It's just never been something that I've done.  Finger?  Oh, I think I've probably had a finger or something in there.  Two?  No.  One, maybe.  And even that, I don't remember.  You don't even remember?  Uh-uh.  It's been a while.  Oh, you haven't had sex in a while?  No, I haven't.  Why?  What's that about?  Because I usually am in relationships when I have sex. 
[03:52:00]  I don't just like, you know, I'm a good girl.  I'm sorry.  And you ever mess with a girl?  I don't try to be something I'm not.  I'm just, I'm not.  You ever mess with a girl?  Yeah, you ever mess with a girl?  I've made out with a couple girls, but I've never had sex with a girl.  And do you have kids?  No, I don't.  I don't have kids.  So you like being spanked.  You like your hair pulled a little bit.  Is there anything really dirty you like?  Or are you pretty traditional?  Just kind of, you know, like your thing about being hardcore is just kind of getting smacked  and having your hair pulled and being dominated a little bit.  No, she does some things.  No, I do.  I mean, in my private, personal life.  Yeah, she's a piece of garbage. 
[03:52:30]  I like to, yeah.  What do you like to do?  I like her off.  She's a fucking piece of filth.  I love her.  I do.  You can feel it on her energy.  She is a small town girl made good.  I'm telling you, she is a fucking soldier, dude.  She's a fucking soldier.  And she likes to be fucking manhandled because you can tell she comes in.  There's a bunch of dudes in here.  And she comes in here and she challenges owning the room.  Not a lot of dudes do that.  So ultimately, she's like a lawyer or a doctor.  She loves somebody to tell her to shut her big fucking mouth, stop talking. 
[03:53:00]  And she does take it in the ass if you give it to her.  But everybody goes, can I please fuck you in the ass, penthouse?  Shut up, you dirty.  I've never had a guy ask me.  Here's what somebody should do.  Here's what I would do to you.  Okay, go ahead.  Tell me what you'd do.  I would roll up this penthouse magazine.  Okay.  Face showing.  I might want to be careful.  Your face.  Your face showing, I would pull your hair.  Okay.  And as I'm fucking you from the back with my anger, because my dick is not as big as  it should be, I'll smack you in the head with this magazine. 
[03:53:30]  In the head?  Yes.  I don't know that I'd like that.  And then go like that.  It doesn't matter what you like.  Okay.  And then I would go.  Fair enough.  I would go, you fucking piece of garbage.  And it would just, boom, you shut up.  And then take it and put the roll-up magazine in your mouth.  You'll feel horrible afterwards.  But afterwards, after I bust a nice nut and you bust a nice nut, I'll tell you that was  fucking fantastic.  Listen, as long as I get mine, I don't care what the fuck you're getting me.  Yes, you will, nigga.  You will get yours, motherfucker.  Yes.  And you wonder why she hasn't been with a black guy before.  Because she knows the whole... 
[03:54:00]  Wow, he just sealed the deal for me.  Yeah.  But no, trust me.  At the end of the day, I'll love you with all my heart.  All right, David, you got any other questions?  That's great.  You got it.  By the way, do you like when a guy talks dirty to you?  I love when guys talk dirty to you.  Except for big niggas.  See what I'm saying?  All right, well, let's let David talk dirty to her.  Say something sexual.  She likes being talked dirty to David.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  What would you say?  You're not allowed to tell him what to say.  Exactly.  There's nothing to post it.  I was like, here, say this.  This is what I would say.  David, just say you want this big Jew dick. 
[03:54:30]  Wait, David's laughing at a post-it.  That is what it is.  I want to know what the post-it says now.  All right, what's the post-it saying?  Tell me what the post-it says.  Read it.  Have you ever tasted a Jewish cock?  Wow.  You know, I've never thought to ask a cock what its religious preference would be.  But I will remember next time.  Excuse me, penis.  Are you Jewish?  Have you ever had a chosen teabag? 
[03:55:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  All right, David.  David, talk dirty.  Ask some of these dirty questions over here.  No, I want David to talk dirty to you.  Okay, David, talk dirty to me.  Shh.  Let David talk dirty.  Oh, sorry.  I'm fucking up.  I was talking to you in person with my fault.  And not just, David, not one line.  Just fucking go with it.  Let's go.  Okay, close your eyes and pretend like we're having sex.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Close your eyes.  Come on, David.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  Pretend like we're having sex and tell me what you want me to do to you. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah.  Talk dirty to this.  Yeah.  Whatever the first thing is, pretend like we're having sex.  Tell me what you want me to do to you.  Okay.  Go ahead.  Close your eyes.  Close your eyes.  You'll feel better if you're close your eyes.  Yeah.  What music is this?  This is great.  This is like chicka-bowl-bowl.  Yeah.  It's fascinating.  This is great music.  Okay.  Everybody be quiet.  Let him think.  You got to visualize it.  I'm visualizing it.  Okay.  Tell me what you want me to do.  All right.  Go ahead.  I want you to take my clothes off.  Okay. 
[03:56:00]  I'm taking your clothes off.  Okay.  Now you're naked.  Now what?  Now get down there and suck my dick.  Nice.  All right.  My mouth is around your dick.  How do you want me to suck it?  Suck it like in and out.  Suck it.  As opposed to the pan flute.  Yeah.  How do you want me to suck it?  Oh, God.  You said suck it right after my clothes off.  Yeah.  That's what I would want.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, David's doing all right so far.  I mean, you have to get dirtier, though. 
[03:56:30]  You have to be raunchy.  So tell me to suck your dick, but say it dirty.  Please suck my dick, Taya.  Please.  No.  No.  How about open your mouth?  Tell her open her mouth.  Who's talking to him?  Oh, him.  Open up.  Please.  Open your mouth and tuck my dick.  Please, Taya.  Okay.  I'm sucking your dick.  Do you want me to lick your balls?  Yes, please.  I'm trying to be serious.  I'm having a really hard time.  Please.  Lick the balls.  Please.  Are your balls hairy or have you shaving your balls?  He's not a hairy guy. 
[03:57:00]  He's not?  No.  I bet you his balls are real hairy, though.  I bet you David, the curse of David, he's a small lad and his balls are wolfish and hairy.  They're like wolfman balls.  Yeah, they're just disgusting.  Because I don't lick balls if they're hairy.  It's just like, no, no.  If I'm going to groom, you have to groom as well.  I'll shave your balls for you if you want.  All right.  Do you want me to shave your balls?  Sure.  If that's what it takes, sure.  Okay.  I'll shave your balls.  Sure.  Okay.  Somebody bring me a razor.  I'm going to shave his balls.  Don't tempt us because we do stuff for real on this show. 
[03:57:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  If you want to shave his balls, we'll get that done.  No, no, no.  He's like, no, no, no, no, no.  All right, go ahead, David.  Continue.  Go ahead.  Okay, so.  Talk about her pussy or so.  Definitely.  So, all right.  Now, would you take your clothes off?  I'm already naked.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  All right.  Now, can I.  You're sucking my cock, right?  Yes, I'm sucking your cock.  All right.  Now, I want to put it inside you.  Okay.  And let me jam it inside you. 
[03:58:00]  Wow.  All right.  Keep going.  Are you enjoying this?  He opened his eyes as if to say, wait a minute.  You're letting me do this?  This is consensual fucking fantasy?  He's not used to having two free hands.  There's usually one holding a pistol.  Oh, my God.  No, he's doing a good job.  Have you ever been with a woman?  You've never had sex, right?  No.  Never?  Never.  Jeez.  All right.  Go ahead, David.  Do you watch a lot of porn?  Oh, yes.  So, you should know how to talk filthy dirty. 
[03:58:30]  All right.  Please, let me stick it inside you.  Please?  I like it.  It's cute.  I don't think I've ever had anybody say please.  Yeah, you don't say please.  He's very polite.  He's a very polite sex guy.  David, you never want to hear cute, so you better, like, up your game.  All right.  No, I think I'm just saying I've never had, maybe it would be, maybe I'd like it.  I don't know.  I've never had a guy say please.  All right.  I feel like you're, like, going to put out a napkin on my back here in a minute.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 
[03:59:00]  He's going to tuck a napkin.  All right, so we're having sex.  I'm putting it inside you.  Now, turn over.  Let me get it from the other side.  Okay, so what, you want it doggy style?  Definitely.  I like that.  Okay.  You do?  Oh, yes, Tay.  I love that style, yes.  I love the doggy style, yes.  Let me put it in your ass.  Not the pussy verse?  I did.  I did that already.  Oh, you took it out already.  He's been in the pussy.  He's old hat at this point.  Yeah, he's been in the pussy.  Now he has me doggy style, and he must have to get in my ass.  Almighty, Mount Pussy, what's the roll with you? 
[03:59:30]  Yeah.  I'm sorry about this.  He kind of.  Yeah, definitely.  David, are you going to lick your fingers before you're jamming in, or is it worse?  How are you going to put your dick in her ass?  You have to wet her ass first, David.  You have to do that.  Spread the cheeks a little bit.  You have to lick your, okay.  All right, spread your ass open so I can lick your ass first.  Get it all nice and wet.  Oh, you're going to lick it?  Yes, get it all nice and wet before I put it in you.  You want me to lick it?  Okay, so good.  What?  This is genius, like.  All right, yeah.  This is fucking genius.  Now, David's going with it now.  Oh, it's genius.  David's good. 
[04:00:00]  I'm having a good time.  In the middle of licking her ass hole.  This is fucking genius.  He's good.  Yep.  I mean, he's doing a good job.  All right, I'm licking your ass hole now.  How does that taste, Tay?  I don't know.  You tell me.  How does that feel, I mean?  How does that feel, Tay?  Because it tastes like mushrooms.  How does it feel?  My tongue inside your ass hole?  Is it getting all nice and wet?  Yes, your spit is making my asshole very wet.  I think I'm ready.  You're ready?  Would you like me to stick it inside your ass?  Dude, what the fuck? 
[04:00:30]  You're all penis.  He's not doing bad.  Don't forget, he has no memories to go from.  He's not doing bad.  This is genius.  This is genius.  But he has watched a lot of porn.  I'll shut up.  This is genius.  He has watched a lot of porn.  He has no memories.  Go ahead, David.  Yeah.  He has watched a lot of porn.  Take that ass.  All right, I'm putting it in your ass now, Tay.  What are you doing, though, Dave?  You're holding the whole dick, and you're just pushing the helmet in slow?  No, no, Tay.  I'm slowly putting, yes, I'm slowly putting it in your ass.  It's going inside now.  I'm not really out of time yet.  Do you feel it? 
[04:01:00]  I can.  I can feel it.  You can?  Yes.  Your cock is huge.  Oh, thank you.  No, I'm slamming.  I don't think my asshole can take it.  You better pull it out.  I'm jamming it in and out, in and out, in and out.  Ouch, ouch.  It's hurting?  Ouch.  Am I being too rough on you, Tay?  Yes, you are.  Why?  You're a bad boy.  I'm a bad boy?  Tell me, Tay.  You are a bad boy.  I'm going to spank you.  Oh, spank me.  Okay.  Take off your pants.  I'll spank you.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Spank me harder.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God. 
[04:01:30]  All right.  Okay.  Where are you going to pull out and come on me?  No.  I'm not ready to come yet, no.  No.  I like David.  It takes a long time for me to come.  It does?  It takes a long time, yeah.  Really?  It takes a long time?  It certainly does, yes.  I don't think it would take long at all with me.  That's just my opinion.  Yeah.  All right.  Come here.  I want to tell you.  I need it back in the other way.  Turn around.  He's all into this.  Turn around.  Back in the other way.  Hey, David, right from the ass into the vagina?  Oh, we can't have that. 
[04:02:00]  Yeah, that's bacteria.  You got to go ass to mouth first.  Yeah, everyone knows ass to mouth.  Okay.  Say something sexy.  I'm going to go hose off my prick.  Wait here.  I'll be right back.  Now you've hosed off your prick.  It's clean.  Okay.  Back to the mouth then, I guess.  Okay.  All right.  Open your mouth.  Let me put it back in the mouth.  Suck on it.  Would you suck on it, baby?  Suck on it, baby.  And what do you think your dick is tasting like to her right now today?  Do you like it?  I think it tastes...  Do you like it?  I do. 
[04:02:30]  It tastes great.  All right.  Take it in your mouth, Taya.  Okay.  It's in my mouth.  Oh, yes.  In and out of your mouth.  Taste it.  I'm tasting it.  Do you like that?  I do.  You like it?  Yes.  In and out.  In and out.  I would be horrible on the phone sex line.  Okay.  Back to...  Actually, I think I'd be better.  Maybe I wouldn't have to be...  Where are we going now with your...  All right, Taya.  Back in your pussy.  Please.  Let me put it in.  Okay.  She has something to do.  She has to catch a plane, David.  Yeah, let's go.  She has to fucking get out of here soon.  All right.  In and out.  You got to come, David. 
[04:03:00]  You got to go.  Oh, yes.  In and out.  In and out.  In and out.  In and out.  Yes.  Yes.  Concentrate, man.  You got to nuts.  You got to go.  Yes.  Rewind.  We're going to come.  We're going to come.  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, I'm going to come.  I'm going to come.  Make it sound like it's a real one, David.  Oh, Taya.  I'm going to come.  Yes.  You have to make the orgasm sound.  Are you going to come in my pussy or are you going to pull it out and come all over my  tits?  No, I'm going to pull it out.  I'm going to pull it out quick.  You are?  I won't come in your pussy.  No, I'll pull it out.  Okay. 
[04:03:30]  Where are you going to put it?  All over your tits.  I'm going to come all over your tits.  All over your tits.  I'm going to shoot it over your tits.  It's all over your tits.  Thanks, David.  That's good, you and Patrice.  You're just moaning with Patrice.  I was turned on and I could see it with Patrice. 
[04:04:00]  Oh, yeah, nigga.  Man, Patrice.  Oh, shit.  Orgasm.  Nice.  Wow.  Now go on down to the mess hall and get me another bowl or something, nigga.  The mess hall.  To the cafeteria, motherfucker.  All right.  Well, David, that's wonderful.  Was that good for you, baby?  Take the cum now.  Look it all up.  All right, David.  She's following her down the street, really.  Look, there's cum in your shoes.  Better get it.  Just barking dirty shit at her. 
[04:04:30]  People are talking about, what the hell is going on?  I didn't come yet.  I want to come.  Give me your ears.  And Taya, can I from here possibly get an un-racist view of that delicious vagina?  We really want to see it.  All right.  Could you show Jimmy and Patrice your vagina?  Whatever.  Whatever you want to do.  And the back, too.  Like the whole part of the thing.  We ask respectfully.  We love it.  Yes, I do.  It is beautiful.  You guys, if you make fun of it, I'm going to do it.  No, no, no.  Wait, leave the panties right at the...  No, leave them off.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  There you go.  Now go down.  Down to the... 
[04:05:00]  Near the knee.  Keep going.  There you go.  Now bend over just so I can see the whole idea.  Jimmy, where do you see over there?  I can't see nothing.  That's the sexy pose.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll show you.  Her ass cheeks are perfect.  They're separated.  And you can see it's really plump lips.  It's thick, a little meaty, but a nice meaty.  Not nasty.  It's beautiful.  It's very full.  Can you be a GFE for just five seconds?  Just be real for five seconds.  I've been real.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  You guys, I'm going to put you all in a headlight. 
[04:05:30]  No, no, no, no.  Taya, will you listen to what I'm saying?  That's it.  I'm going to beat your ass.  No, listen to what I'm saying.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  I mean, that view, that view, because I didn't ask much, that view, just the pretend you really  like me, backshot view.  Meaning, like, you want it in there.  Not the fucking trained way, the dancer's way, just the fucking, give it to me.  Oh, my God.  Wow, is that.  Are you having fun?  It's nice.  Holy.  Is it good for you?  It's fucking beautiful.  Nice, nice, nice, yeah. 
[04:06:00]  I know, it's pretty meaty.  There's nothing.  And then she's not even turned on right now.  If she's turned on and it swells up a little bit.  One of that shit turned you on?  David didn't turn you on with any of that crap?  Oh, I'm so turned on right now.  David's hot.  And I love the way you lifted up your back of your heel posing again.  Yeah, right.  You're such a fucking penthouse magazine pose.  I've been posing for a long time.  I think I actually have sex like that now.  Pretend you really want me to stick something in there.  Ready?  Toodley-doo-dah.  Here's my foot action. 
[04:06:30]  Is the light correct?  You have to hike the foot up.  Or you can't get the separation.  I know these things.  I like that.  That was fucking beautiful.  Oh, no, that was a trooper move right there.  Thank you.  It was.  I'm sorry.  I have sex like a porn star.  You want to judge interns cocks with us?  Sure.  I forgot about that.  What happened, Jimmy?  I have to leave.  Where are you going?  We'll have to do it tomorrow then.  Yeah, we'll have to do it tomorrow.  It's just guys in the studio then.  Where are you going?  I got a meeting for a legal thing.  Got to do it.  Legal?  Aw, man.  Shut up.  Hey, did you know that office Christmas parties are one of the leading causes of infidelity? 
[04:07:00]  Hell yeah.  You know this?  It's a season, baby.  You know that people fool around at work?  I don't know because I've never been to a work like that, but it sounds like something  I would do.  According to a recent article, 49% of people said if given the opportunity, they would have  a quickie with a co-worker at this year's office Christmas party.  Mistletoe, bitches.  Mistletoe.

[04:08:30]  I was on your side, too.  That's true.  You were.  You were.  But you got to come sit closer to me so I feel like I'm surrounded.  Fuck that.  I'm looking through this magazine.  What are you talking?  You were colored garbage.  It's not one nigglet in here.  What?  Not a nigglet to be found in this penthouse magazine.  Hey, I can't help it.  I'm just in one spread in there.  I can't control the rest of the magazine.  All right.  I'll, uh...  Yeah.  I mean, what I was saying, too, is like, you know, that was sweet talk for me.  Yeah.  Iraq, you got anything?  Are you sweet talking me?  No.  Sam, anything you want to ask her? 
[04:09:00]  No.  I think David's got some more questions.  Yeah, you passed your questions to David, you scandalous little shit, you.  Oh.  He's the one passing him the post-it notes.  I saw him.  All those really dirty things David said were him.  I can tell.  What were some of the other post-its, Iraq?  Yeah, they're all torn up on the floor.  I don't think David liked them.  Let's force Iraq to recite some of the post-its.  I'll recite it.  Post-its.  Post-its.  And did you notice after a while, David was giving him post-its and everything everybody  was giving him?  David was like, shut the fuck up.  I don't need this shit. 
[04:09:30]  Iraq, read some of the posts that you read for David.  He's ripped them.  Look, they're all good.  Do you mind if Iraq read them?  I'll read them too.  I don't know.  All right, go ahead.  One of them is, okay.  I want to eat a Slim Jim out of your sweaty box.  My box is sort of like a Slim Jim, so okay.  The other one says, choke on my shitty dick, you slit.  That would be slut.  Okay.  It says slit.  It says slit.  Let me see.  It says slit.  All right, what else?  It does say slit.  What else?  Who wrote this?  How about a slunt? 
[04:10:00]  What else?  You wrote slit.  Choke on my dick.  Another one says, a slit is the slit.  It's the line.  But it says, choke on my shitty dick, you slit.  That's what it says.  Yeah, it's the slit.  That's when Dave was having sex with your ass, and then he put it into your mouth.  Oh, oh, oh.  So these ones, okay.  Wait, Dave's got another one?  This post-it poses a question to you.  How many inches can your ass pack?  How many inches do you have, David?  Oh.  And?  And this one says, fuck me.  I own a bank. 
[04:10:30]  I own a bank as well.  So you fuck me, you dirty little pervert.  Is that it?  All right.  That's it.  Okay, is that it?  All right, Taya Parker.  We got off on the wrong point, but you did all right.  I don't know why.  I love you.  You did all right.  And I think your show's amazing.  Thank you for having me.  You did very well today.  Penthouse.com.  And you're doing, what, a signing or something?  Yes, I am.  You can meet Taya Parker tomorrow night at the Romantic Depot.  What's that?  It's a place where I'm going to be signing magazines.  No, I know that.  I don't know. 
[04:11:00]  Is it an adult store or something?  I think so, yeah.  Okay, the Romantic Depot in Paramus, New Jersey.  How long are you in town for?  I leave on Thursday.  Thursday?  I leave on Thursday.  And then what are you doing?  The Penthouse Club in the air?  I'm going to be at the Penthouse Club Wednesday night for dinner, if you guys want to join.  No, no, no.  Would you go home with Patrice?  My girl's there, too.  Your girl's at home with you?  Yeah, we do that.  She hot?  She's a hot chick.  I've never been with a girl, and I've never been with a black man.  Well, you could kill two birds with one stone.  First threesome, buy down. 
[04:11:30]  First threesome, first black man, and first chick.  Delicious.  It's like three-time virgin.  You think she's playing again?  She's playing.  I'm not.  But she has that in her soul.  Would you think about it?  I'm not playing.  I have not.  No, not that part.  And that whole rolling up a new thing and hitting you, that's later as we build.  You wouldn't do that right off the bat?  Right.  Right off the bat, there'll be plenty of pussy eating, which I know you'll probably enjoy.  I love that.  Oh, yeah.  You love what?  I love when guys eat my pussy. 
[04:12:00]  That's my favorite.  Maybe a three-way kiss.  I'm into that, too.  How do you do a three-way kiss?  Oh, just fucking everyone kissing each other.  But two girls have to like each other.  Yeah.  Three-person kisses.  Beautiful.  You got to try it.  Never done three-person.  I've kissed girls before.  But realness.  I'm being real.  Just a realness.  Do you want to kiss a girl now?  I'm not going to just kiss a random girl, no.  Just some bitch.  I'm just going to kiss some girl.  Because I already got naked for some random guy, and I'm not going to kiss some random girl. 
[04:12:30]  Come on.  I mean, I do have standards.  Lily, would you kiss the penthouse pet of the year?  I'm not going to just kiss girls.  Jesus, who the fuck is this?  She's beautiful.  I would be sorry.  Is this who did you at the massage bar?  Holy shit, Patrice.  It kind of looks like it, Patrice.  Oh, my God.  Shut up, David.  Oh, man.  All right, wait.  Your mic wasn't on.  You would kiss the penthouse pet of the year?  Yeah.  Wow. 
[04:13:00]  She's hot.  Why don't you kiss her?  It'd be a great way to envy it.  I'm not going to kiss her.  And it doesn't have anything to do with her.  She's beautiful.  I can't just go in and kiss anybody.  Do you don't like Asians?  No, it has to be like you.  And Tay is late in racism.  It's not going to happen.  Yeah, you know what?  Hey, I don't know.  Tay is late in racism.  Like, if we were hanging out and we were having a kind of drink.  What are you going to do something for our show?  Tay is...  That's fucking funny as hell.  Tay is...  Tay is Midwestern passive-aggressive racism.  We will not allow her to kiss an Asian girl.  No, it has nothing to do.  She's beautiful.  She kind of has like a Tila tequila thing about her. 
[04:13:30]  She's hot.  Lily from Ron and Fez.  What do you...  You know?  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Yeah, very good.  Now, you should be disappointed that the penthouse pet of the year doesn't want to kiss you.  It's not to her.  It's not her.  I am going to hurt.  Yeah.  Oh, stop it.  Tay.  She's going to give me the sad girl eyes.  How about no tongue?  Yeah, just a peck.  Tay, what'd you do about that?  I'll just peck her.  Yeah, I just ain't like to make out with a girl.  I have to be like...  Oh, my God.  She knows what I'm talking about.  Girls are different than guys.  Let me tell you something about this.  I didn't know she existed.  Let me say something, man.  She is...  I don't know how sexy she is.  She has Western, complete Western sarcasm, but fucking third worldness all over her. 
[04:14:00]  Oh, my God.  Is that good?  I don't know.  I think he's complimenting.  Coming from him, I think it's a compliment.  I'm her mentor.  Okay, so we're going to kiss now.  No joke.  Yes.  Listen, Lily, Lily, let me be...  This is...  Because Lily's beautiful and fucking Tay is beautiful.  But here's what's sexy about what's getting ready to happen.  Wow.  Fucking Lily's for real. 
[04:14:30]  Lily is for real.  Lily is not bullshitting.  That's right.  You're going to lose if you don't match her energy.  Her fucking energy.  I'm talking to you, Tay.  She fucking is down for this.  She's taking your energy right now.  If we were out...  All right, do me a favor.  Hold on a second.  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute, Tay.  Stop talking for a second.  Just do it the way men like it for a second.  Okay.  I do a lot of things the way men like it.  Just get close to her face.  Don't kiss her.  You might not be the best looking girl in the room anymore. 
[04:15:00]  Whoa.  There's an energy thing happening right now.  Yes, and let me say something to you.  And I say this my whole life.  A fucking...  I'm not saying you're ugly, but an ugly 19-year-old is sexier than a beautiful 40-year-old, Jack.  And that's real.  So Lily's youngness...  She's gorgeous.  She is beautiful.  ...is delicious.  And her downness...  Oh!  And her...  Wait a minute.  And her downness is real. 
[04:15:30]  Her downness is real.  Yours is because you're just experienced and you're a soldier, but she is twiddling her fucking fingers.  And she got that dirty, quiet Asian thing in the bottom.  Hold on, Patrice.  My dick is filling up.  It hasn't filled up this whole time.  It's filling up now.  Hold on, Patrice.  New Lily was playing with her hair, too.  Oh, my gosh.  She...  Play with her hair again a little bit.  Oh, my God.  She likes the hair.  Oh, she's fucking...  Lily's a soldier.  Really soft.  Aw.  To Lily.  Lily.  To you two, Tay, but Lily's delicious. 
[04:16:00]  New Lily, have you kissed girls before?  I've kissed girls.  Yes.  Yes.  Wait a minute.  And she still...  She still does, Opie.  She still does.  Oh, my God.  Lord have mercy.  Tay, put your clothes on.  Get her out of here.  Lily, I need to talk to you for five minutes.  Let me kiss her for this Lily girl.  Yeah, we gotta get...  I'm just bullshitting with you, baby.  I'm bullshitting with you.  Not...  I'm bullshitting with you.  Put your clothes on.  Yeah, no, I'm playing with you, baby.  Yeah.  Don't get offended like that.  I'm playing with you.  I don't get offended, baby.  There's nothing you can say to God. 
[04:16:30]  You definitely beat her in the boob department.  Yeah, I can't.  I appreciate that.  My surgeon would be happy to hear you say that.  Tay, mm.  Lily.  Lily, do you like those boobs?  Can you...  Hey, Tay, just get close.  Don't even kiss.  Don't even kiss.  Just get close to her face.  If your prejudice could stand it.  Oh!  Get close to her face without kissing  and just feel her energy for a second.  Yeah, let's feel the energy here.  Oh, God. 
[04:17:00]  They're like literally centimeters away.  Are they kissing?  Oh, fucking Lily.  No, not kissing yet.  Lily wants to kiss.  They're kissing now.  Say it for me.  They're kissing now.  Oh, my God, Lily.  Kiss, kiss.  That's beautiful.  Shut the fuck up, dude.  That is beautiful.  Oh, shit.  Fucking unbelievable.  Cherry chapstick.  All right.

You did what you had to do to...  You was as great as Lily was. 
[04:18:00]  And you did what you needed to do to be as great.  You was a soldier.  Holla.  But her fucking...  What?  This matches everything you did.  Just her fucking...  She's the girl David in the room.  It's something about her that's just so fucking...  She's fresh.  Hold on, Patrice, let me ask.  Innocently disgusting girl.  Oh.
