<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a live musical performance by Stephen Carr of Foundry, singing "Pendulum," described as having a Johnny Bravo-esque vocal style and a guitar solo.  The hosts commented on Carr's performance, noting improvement in the latter half.  This was followed by a call from Joe Namath promoting his autobiography, *Namath*.  Namath shared anecdotes about his career, including filming *The Brady Bunch*, encounters with other celebrities, his opinions on current and past NFL players (Tom Brady and Peyton Manning specifically mentioned),  his use of Brute aftershave, and speculation about his past involvement with men's magazines. A caller shared a personal anecdote about Namath’s influence on his childhood fashion.

A brief interlude featured Marc Maron's voice. This transitioned into a discussion of anti-smoking commercials, including vintage ads with doctor endorsements and a Flintstones ad.  The hosts debated the deceptive marketing of the tobacco industry and shared listener-submitted jokes on the topic.

A caller, Nikki, criticized the show for jarringly juxtaposing a discussion of suicide with Carr's performance, citing a personal tragedy involving a deceased cousin. This prompted a heated, insensitive exchange, with the hosts aggressively dismissing Nikki.

The show then focused heavily on the death of Steve Irwin, discussing the statistical rarity of stingray fatalities and comparing it to other causes of death, including drug use, accidents, and even sex with horses.  Speculation arose about unreleased footage of Irwin's death and negotiations with his widow. The hosts' discussion became irreverent and darkly humorous.  Callers Matt and Bill contributed personal anecdotes; Matt detailing his children's reaction and Bill describing the attack on Irwin.  This segment transitioned to a discussion of workplace dynamics, detailing a prank played on a staff member, Danny, involving a fabricated dress code meeting. Patrice O’Neill filled in for Jim Norton during this portion. The show also mentioned an appearance on the *CBS Early Show*.

A subsequent segment centered on a *Sex and the City* episode's "Tookus Lingus" scene, prompting explicit discussion of the show's depiction of female sexuality and comparisons to *Queer as Folk*.  Callers offered various reactions and detailed personal accounts. A Time magazine reporter was present in studio during this discussion. The segment continued with a blow-by-blow account of a physical altercation between Master Poe and Eastside Dave, detailing grappling techniques and injuries, including the use of a sock as a weapon.  The show then recounted Jim Norton and Eric the Actor's encounter with Paris Hilton, analyzing resulting photos deemed highly inappropriate.

Another segment included a discussion about unseen photos of a co-worker, Eli.  This transitioned into a highly personal and graphic recounting by Anthony of a childhood showering experience with his father, leading to sexually charged innuendo and accusations of repressed homosexuality.  The conversation branched out to BDSM, focusing on Karen Von Croft and graphic descriptions of extreme sexual scenarios.  The hosts and callers shared personal sexual experiences and preferences.  The discussion then shifted to a “compliment box” art installation, leading to a vulgar discussion about offensive language, focusing on the words "nigger" and "faggot."  A call to Citibank devolved into insults and obscenities.

A significant portion of the show addressed the appropriateness of Native American mascots in professional sports, prompting a discussion about racial and ethnic stereotypes in team names and mascots.  The hosts and callers used extremely offensive racial slurs (including the n-word) while debating the sensitivity of mascots like Chief Wahoo and Chief Nakahoma, and the Philadelphia Phanatic.  The conversation touched on the history of black players in professional sports, Jackie Robinson and the Philadelphia Phillies being mentioned. The hosts also critiqued Andrea Peiser's New York Post column criticizing Patrice O'Neal and Louis C.K. for offensive jokes at a charity event for homeless women.

The final segment focused on the fallout from the comedy show for a women's homeless shelter.  Patrice O’Neal was in studio.  The hosts and O’Neal defended the comedians' offensive jokes against Andrea Pizer's criticisms and her withdrawal of funding.  They read excerpts from Pizer's column and O’Neal's fiancée's email. The discussion included vulgar and sexually explicit commentary, interspersed with unrelated tangents, like a news segment of white people in Jamaican attire and Jim Norton's recent breakup. The segment concluded with Anthony Cumia unexpectedly leaving the studio, with the remaining hosts continuing the discussion, including a call from a listener while Anthony was driving away.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, this is Duff McKagan, and you're listening to Stephen Carr, lead singer of Foundry.  All right, so I want Steve to be okay.  All right, what are we doing now?  Are you going to sing along to your own band?  Yeah, give me the Foundry one.  All right, here we go.  Steve, for the first time, singing Foundry live on our show.  Oh, there he is.  Hi, Sam.  With the camera?  I mean, I do. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah.  Pantamon will swing at the center of attention.  Just another day, another condescension.  Mock you, shock you, it's gonna lock you down. 
[00:01:00]  The pendulum will shift with a little bit of pressure.  Move too slow, and the pendulum will catch you.  Show you, oh, yeah, it's gonna throw you around.  You did the crime and not the time.  Now you gotta pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I can take of all your screaming in my ear.  My back is gonna break if you push me one more time. 
[00:01:30]  Heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  The Vangelium is swinging back the other way.  Wow, you're Johnny Bravo.  He's rocking.  Yeah, he's Johnny Bravo, though.  He's belting it out.  The Vangelium doesn't love his girl. 
[00:02:00]  Pendulum team.  Thank you, Jim.  I'll have you call her and explain this.  Bump you and chump you.  He's gonna dump you out.  Pendulum will break under too much tension.  Down the walls of my detention.  Wrecking ball and kingdom falling down.  You did the crime and not the time. 
[00:02:30]  Now you gotta pay for what you've done.  You better run.  I've had all I can take of all your screaming in my ear.  Back is gonna break if you push me one more time.  I, I, I, I, I.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  The Vangelium is swinging back the other way. 
[00:03:00]  Rock.  Damn.  Guitar solo.  Rock.  There it is.  Obligatory guitar solo, by the way.  Of course.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way. 
[00:03:30]  The pendulum is swinging back the other way.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  If you see me coming, best get out of my way.  The Vangelium is swinging back the other way.  My heart's getting heavy.  My blood's getting cold.  You changed me into something that I just can't control.  And if you see me coming, best get out of my way. 
[00:04:00]  The Vangelium is swinging back the other way.  Wow.  Very good.  Thank you, sweetie.  Steve, I didn't think Steve would belt it out like that.  Steve belted it out.  The second half was much better than the first.  He got relaxed, I think.  Yeah, I calmed down a little bit.  Wow.  Yeah, you calmed down a little bit.  So when is the pendulum going to start swinging and be straight?  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:30]  What's going on?  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's stupid.  Something ridiculously loud and obnoxious.  Sound like the best of Down Syndrome records.  We're never going to make everybody happy.  So why do we have to now make more people not happy?  Oh, no.  It's stupid.  If I may use the word duty.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Joe Namath.  Joe.  Hey, fellas.  How are you, sir?  It's Joe Namath.  I'm doing well.  It's good to hear you guys. 
[00:05:00]  Very good.  Good to hear you, Joe.  Wow.  Look at that voice.  You got that voice, Joe.  He's got that voice.  You know it's Joe Namath.  Yep.  Oh, me.  Yeah.  You got a book out?  I do.  I do.  I did a book with a Rugged Land publisher called Namath.  And I was influenced, certainly, by the couple of books that they had already done with Brett  Favre and Walter Payton.  I just liked the quality of the books.  And then Rugged Land seemed like a good team to work with. 
[00:05:30]  And right now they are.  And we're having a good run.  And the book's finished, and we're very proud of it.  It kind of feels like a textbook feel to it.  It's all got pretty cool paper.  It's not like that dry, awful paper.  I like the feel of a lot of photos.  Yes.  Yes.  And by, you know, Harry Benson and Neil Leifert and Bart Silverman are some top-notch photographers.  Now, how about the girls?  Are there any talk about the girls in here?  Because that's, you know, the legendary Joe Namath.  We would love to know about the girls.  Well, I've talked about most things that were pertinent that I could share with the reader. 
[00:06:00]  This is basically a book to be shared with the family.  And the DVD that's added to it by NFL Films is a very fine DVD.  I've never, you know, I've worked on four books now.  I had help with Dick Schaap and Bob Oates Jr. on three of them.  And this one was different, certainly, and it was more difficult and took longer to get done. 
[00:06:30]  But I enjoyed the process.  Now, Joe, I've got to ask you, in this book, does it include probably the pinnacle of your career,  playing catch with young Bobby Brady on the Brady Puppet?  Yeah, old Bobby tried to fool me that time.  I remember that.  You know, you didn't have to be such a nice guy and go over to their house.  For God's sake, the guy's lying that he knows you.  Yeah, we caught him, though, see? 
[00:07:00]  We taught him a lesson.  Yeah, said he was sick.  And then Joe, being nice, goes over and sees this sick boy.  And it turns out that his father was sick.  You didn't walk into your trailer and have to throw Mr. Brady out, did you?  Yeah.  I'm sure Mr. Brady really took a liking to you.  That's pretty amazing.  The Brady Bunch had such a following to this day.  Of course.  People will say, hey, I remember the Brady Bunch you did.  It's the kick.  Go out for a pet.  You should have drilled one right into his head. 
[00:07:30]  Hey, you know, they put him in a harness and raised him about 30 feet over the stage  and then crossed the stage with him up there 30 feet he crossed.  I wouldn't have gotten up there.  He went above and beyond the call of duty, I thought.  Very memorable episode.  You're right up there with Davey Jones.  Are you disgusted at all with a lot of the players today?  Maybe it's just perception.  The media coverage is different.  Are they really as arrogant and awful as they seem?  They seem a little bit different back 30 years ago.  Well, it certainly was different. 
[00:08:00]  But, guys, you know, things have been changing for a good while now.  We're not seeing anything new that hasn't existed since the 80s.  You know, the NFL has done a pretty good job in policing the players' behavior out there  and trying to keep it focused on the game.  But you have show business more in the game today than ever before.  I personally don't like that they're policing all that.  I love all the showboating.  It makes it so exciting, all the crap they're doing in the end zone and stuff.  Right.  But some of it is certainly out of place, any kind of taunting deals and premeditated stuff. 
[00:08:30]  You know, we are a team out on the field.  But when the individual stuff starts taking center stage, I know it's good for home entertainment.  But for teamwork and the rest of the group, they don't really care for that.  Yeah, but they take care of their own.  I mean, if you're showboating too much, you know, you're going to pay down the road.  Of course.  Of course.  But this has been going on.  I remember when Billy White Shoes Johnson started doing the dancing, man, and that was all right. 
[00:09:00]  There were a lot of guys, you know, doing some things in nice ways.  But then it got ugly.  It got mean.  It kind of got, you know, out of line.  And then it's really reach.  Guys start reaching.  You know, whenever they're planning and plotting what they're going to do for a game rather than play,  you know they're not quite focused.  You know, when you're doing a five-step dance routine in the end zone, it really is kind of uncomfortable to watch.  Or pull out a cell phone, you know. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, didn't he?  He grabbed a cell phone behind him.  Yeah.  That really is pompous.  Yeah, yeah.  Bring him props.  Joe, I got a memory of you.  I used to be a caddy at the Huntington Crescent Club.  And I was maybe 14 or 15 at the time.  And you came to play a round of golf.  This goes back a few years.  And you were out there.  And every single female member followed you around that day.  You didn't even know they were following you around because they were hiding in the bushes and behind trees and stuff. 
[00:10:00]  Joe was hiding in the bushes later that evening.  But it was unbelievable how many women were following you around just as you played one round of golf at the Huntington Crescent Club back in the day.  Why didn't you tell me?  I was just a nobody.  It was Broadway Joe, man.  You were quite the showman back then, you know.  But when you mention caddy, you bring back some memories, too, because I did that for about six years and loved it.  Yeah, it was probably my favorite job.  Yeah, that was good. 
[00:10:30]  I have one complaint, though.  You could have picked any broad on the sideline and you went after Susie there.  Well.  The famous clip.  I mean, she's not a looker, Joe.  I got to be the one to tell you.  You could have any broad in America and you picked her.  I'm sure she's a fine lady and she does a good job on the sidelines.  But, I mean, come on, Joe.  You let us down.  Well, I have apologized, but not because of what you say about her.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  There you go.  Hey, did you wake up the next morning and just go, thank God it wasn't Pam Oliver? 
[00:11:00]  No, but what I did the next morning, I felt like a real dog, you know, whenever I figured  out what had transferred.  Oh, no one saw it, Joe.  It wasn't bad, dude.  Don't worry about it.  It was harmless.  No, it didn't make for you.  Yeah, barely anyone saw it.  It was done, you know.  It was done.  And then it was time to change your pace, man.  It happened.  I'm sure the joking continues to this day among your circle of friends, though.  You guys are bad.  You know something, Joe?  I have to confront you on this. 
[00:11:30]  You made a year of my life miserable when I was in elementary school because of that  goddamn fur coat.  My mother, who, of course, was in love with Joe Namath, saw you in the fur coat.  Now, when you're Broadway Joe Namath and you're winning Super Bowls and you're out there in  the fur coat, it's cool.  Going to Hollywood premieres.  Yeah, you're going to parties.  You got the hot blood on your arm.  You can wear the fur coat. 
[00:12:00]  You're making CeCe and Company.  Yeah.  You're making movies.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, you're a CeCe writer.  You're wearing the fur coat.  It's cool.  My mother went and got a fur coat for me.  I don't even know.  I think I was in, like, the third or fourth grade.  I got my ass kicked because I was wearing a fur coat like a girl.  Well, it might have been that ribbon in your hair, too.  You know, actually, she was such a Joe Namath fan, she sent me in stockings also. 
[00:12:30]  Hey, did you, honestly, did you wear Brute?  Of course I did.  I did that even in college.  That's why it was so much fun to go to work with them initially.  Yeah.  The folks that were owners of Fabergé were just a terrific group, so I had fun, yeah.  Muhammad Ali wore Brute, too, you know, and so did – it was something we enjoyed doing,  and it was a great company to work with.  No high karate back then?  No, no, no.  Hey, Joe, you bring up Muhammad Ali.  Were you ever starstruck? 
[00:13:00]  Because, I mean, everyone –  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  Who were you starstruck by?  Bob Hope, Gregory Peck, Frank Sinatra.  Matt Hacks.  Yeah, yeah.  All the biggies.  They turned out being guys, you know, that I had admired their work over the years,  but, yeah, for the most part, they were those kind of guys, and, you know,  when you meet some folks that have accomplished some things, whether it's political or in the arts, 
[00:13:30]  it's always fun.  Starstruck, man, I never met Roberto Clemente, but I was starstruck with him since I was a little kid.  You know, I was a big baseball fan and all.  Oh, that's right.  You're from the Pittsburgh area?  Yes, yes.  I was just outside of Pittsburgh, but I'll never forget when I first met Gregory Peck.  You know, he had that really deep voice, and they introduced me to him.  I said, how do you do, Mr. Peck?  And he says, just call me Greg, Joe.  I said, yes, sir, Mr. Peck.  Yeah, exactly. 
[00:14:00]  I couldn't get myself to call him Greg.  Hey, was there anybody in the NFL that you were scared of?  I mean, look, you got hit a lot.  Was there anybody that you just wanted nothing to do with hitting you?  Yeah, a whole bunch of them, man.  You know, they were sick, a lot of those guys.  What was tough is like before a game, you know, you're standing beside him for the introductions.  And I'll never forget one time standing beside his defensive end.  He was sweating.  His eyes were red.  He was about six foot eight.  And I just said to myself, what am I doing here?  Really, I mean, yeah, there were some folks out there, and there are today. 
[00:14:30]  You know, that's their job, man.  They've got a lot of enthusiasm, and it's to knock other people down, you know.  You know, it was fun to watch, though, back then, where the quarterback would scramble and run with the ball like that instead of just sliding down or heading for the sideline or something like that.  I mean, obviously, it took its toll on your body.  Well, even today, you know, what the NFL has done, and it's not just for quarterbacks.  They've altered the rules to prevent some injuries, hopefully so, to the head and to the knees and all, and rules that have helped the offensive linemen, defensive players, help prevent some injuries. 
[00:15:00]  The quarterback's a bit of a stretch.  I've seen some of the calls recently, and, you know, if you're a defensive player, you can't believe that you get a penalty for that.  But if they didn't enforce those penalties, then the teams would lose their best players. 
[00:15:30]  The fans wouldn't get the quality of the game.  You know, you get two or three quarterbacks knocked out, though, man, it's a hard position, and you're just going to have the quality of the game go downhill.  So I think it also helps maintain a good play.  Hey, Joe, who's the best quarterback in the league right now?  Well, you know, I'd have to go with Tom Brady for past performances.  If we had to go in the one game right now, I'd take Tom Brady, certainly.  But in my opinion, I've not seen anyone like Peyton Manning.  He's a one-of-a-kind.  He really is amazing. 
[00:16:00]  How about the most overrated player?  What?  I think there's an overrated player in the game?  Eli Manning!  I don't know about overrated players, but I also look at some young players,  and what I've been impressed with at this point is the quarterback at Tennessee.  There was a lot of questions about Evans, and the more I watch him, the more I'm saying,  yeah, they're right about this guy.  They're right about this guy.  We forget that the guy's just a rookie, and he won't be running around downfield a whole lot either.  But Tennessee's coming on, and I'm very impressed with him as a young quarterback. 
[00:16:30]  Right on.  And who wins the Super Bowl this year, Joe?  That's the old question that none of us ever know until we get there, it seems, because of Lady Luck.  Look what happened to McNabb the other day.  He gets knocked out, and the Eagles aren't going to measure up now.  No.  They might have had a chance to make the playoffs, but they're not going to measure up now.  Now, if Lady Luck were to pull the same cruel act on a few of the other players, not just quarterbacks,  but if you lose a Manning, if you lose Brady, you know, look what Denver's doing. 
[00:17:00]  I'm a little surprised.  Going to Cutler.  You know, they're starting a rookie quarterback now, and they're still really in the hunt.  So that's going to be interesting.  Hey, in 99, you were right.  96 on the list of 100 greatest football players.  Who was hit 95th?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  They listed you.  Apparently, we have it in our bio here.  The Sporting News had a list of 100 greatest football players, and I was wondering who was right ahead of you,  because if it annoyed you or not.  I tell you, there's got to be a whole lot of them ahead of old Joe. 
[00:17:30]  You guys got to remember something, man.  I knew that I wasn't up to speed when I was coming in,  and there have been guys that have played many years, like myself,  but have been able to perform more consistently over the years.  Yeah, you had personality, Joe.  Anytime, when I hear what Paul Bear Bryant has to say, or Vince Lombardi, or Weeb Eubank,  when those pro coaches and your peers have some things to say about you, that's what I listen to. 
[00:18:00]  So I'm just glad that things worked out and we won the championship.  Well, the book is called Nameth.  It really looks good, man.  A lot of great photos, a whole history of your career.  And is it on sale now?  Yes.  Yeah.  Less reading, more photos.  Always good.  Yes.  Joe knows that.  Lots and lots of photos.  Very cool talking to you, Joe.  Hey, thank you, Opie Anthony.  You guys take care of yourselves.  And little Jimmy Norton, too. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, yeah, Jimmy, speak up.  I've been talking, but we're all just three chiming in.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Take care, Joe.  Thanks for having me on.  All right.  It's Joe Nameth, everyone.  That is very cool.  Joe Willie Nameth.  Yep.  You guys are bad.  Bad.  Someone's saying he sounded like the Grease Man.  Water doodle there.  He had that same delivery.  Yeah.  Oh, wasn't he in Playgirl, too?  What spread did he do?  Did he do a spread for a magazine like that?  I was going to ask him, but I didn't want to say a queer if I was here.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, you would have anyway. 
[00:19:00]  Wrong, right?  Just that you know that.  What did he do?  Didn't he do a spread in one of them?  I don't know.  Fan?  Not going to get an answer from any of us.  Why?  It's okay to know that.  No, it isn't.  Oh, was that Burt Reynolds?  Oh, Burt was in it.  All right.  I'm mixing up my dreamy people.  You know that?  Of course he knows it.  And you even know that.  Stop.  What?  That Burt Reynolds was in Playgirl?  You know that.  I don't think Burt Reynolds was in Playgirl.  I think it was Cosmo.  Cosmo Kramer? 
[00:19:30]  But you knew he did a nude spread.  He certainly wasn't in Jet.  You knew he did a nude spread is what I'm saying.  Yeah.  Maybe it was Cosmo.  He looked like a bearskin rug.  With the leg propped up?  I don't know.  I don't remember the pose.  No, no.  It's Burt laying on his side.  And the leg is propped up.  And he has a towel covering what a lot of us call best parts.  Ladies. 
[00:20:00]  Hey, this is Marc Maron.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst.  It's so good.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  The worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Slide a finger into me, Bob.  Cancer commercials, Anthony.  We got two to play today.  Well, the cancer box song is just terrific.  And that's a commercial?  Yeah, yeah.  But first we got a commercial that they were running for the election that just passed us by. 
[00:20:30]  Some kind of bill.  I think.  I don't know.  Let's take a listen and see what this is about.  Figure it out.  I smoked my first cigarette at the age of 14.  At the age of 48, I got throat cancer.  If you don't want this to happen to your child or someone you love, please vote yes on Amendment 3.  Amendment 3 creates youth, anti-smoking programs, and helps smokers quit. 
[00:21:00]  When you step into that voting booth on Tuesday, think of your kids.  Remember my voice.  Vote yes on Amendment 3.  Thank God the government is there to take care of us.  Because we can't take care of ourselves.  Can't figure out that smoking's bad for you.  So the amendment is what?  Oh, Jimmy doesn't agree.  No, I don't know.  I'm up in the air on this one.  Why?  I don't know what the whole thing is, though.  It sounds like, hey, it protects the kids, but what is it, really? 
[00:21:30]  That type of crap annoys me, although the smoking industry in this one, they for so long lied about what was in their thing, purposefully being deceitful.  It's not like they were being honest all along.  Yeah, I get all that, but it's not.  That was what I like to call the good old days.  I was going to say, yeah, it's not the 50s anymore.  It's 2006.  2006, I'm amazed there are people out there that don't know smoking is really bad for you.  Menthol's good for your throat.  That's pretty much what they were saying back then about cigarettes.  Filter?  Who needs them? 
[00:22:00]  Hey, just smoke your Lucky or your Chesterfield.  They would say, like, you know, nine of ten doctors recommend Chesterfield.  It's got a smooth draw.  These cool words for it.  Smooth draw.  Silky feeling on your throat.  Like it actually helped your throat.  And helps combat lung fever.  Weren't the Lucky Strike ones the best?  Lucky's ruled.  Let me see.  This is an old school Lucky Strike commercial. 
[00:22:30]  Look, you're already winning with the music.  Lucky Strike.  First again with Tobacco Man.  First again with Tobacco Man.  Disjointed.  L-S-M-F-T. 
[00:23:00]  L-S-M-F-T.  Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  Ew.  Yes, in a cigarette, it's the tobacco that counts.  And Lucky Strike means fine tobacco.  So round.  So firm.  Oh.  So fully packed.  So free and easy on the draw.  On the draw.  So for your own real deep down smoking enjoyment, smoke that smoke of fine tobacco, Lucky Strike. 
[00:23:30]  And remember, cigarette paper is white.  Even the paper that is rolled around that fine tobacco is white.  Just like your neighborhood if you smoke Lucky Strike cigarettes.  Lucky Strike.  The favorite cigarette of white people.  If you want a whites-only cigarette, smoke Luckies.  Not like those mentholated Negro cigarettes. 
[00:24:00]  So pick up a Lucky and help win the war against Hitler and the Japs and the Negroes.  Smoke and Lucky.  Easy on the draw.  Easy on the throat.  Recommended by every doctor.  Cancer?  What's that?  Never heard of it.  Smoking Lucky gets rid of tumors.  We don't even know what tumors are.  But it gets rid of them.  You'll find out in the future when there are no more Negroes. 
[00:24:30]  The good old days.  We're trying to find the good cigarette ads.  Where the doctors endorse smoking and all that.  Of course they lied.  We got them.  I just...  There was a point, though, where I don't think they knew.  Look at medical technology back then.  They're a bunch of dopes.  What did they know?  Sucking smoke into your lungs?  Harmful?  Stop it.  Stop it, please. 
[00:25:00]  We were stupid.  We didn't know anything.  If man exceeds 30 miles per hour for any length of time, he will surely perish.  Nine?  One of my favorites, when the train came out, people couldn't do 30 miles an hour for any  length of time where they will surely perish.  That's what they said.  Really?  That's what some dope said.  Yeah.  Ew.  30.  Hey, I think I found the cigarette ad where the doctors endorse smoking.  Ah, let's talk to a doctor.  According to a recent nationwide survey, more doctors smoke camels than any other cigarette. 
[00:25:30]  Three leading independent research organizations asked this question of 113,597 doctors.  Wow.  What cigarette do you smoke, doctor?  The brand name most was Camel.  Now, you probably enjoy rich, full flavor and cool mildness in a cigarette just as much  as doctors do.  That's why if you're not a Camel smoker now, try a Camel on your T-zone.  That's T for taste and T for throat. 
[00:26:00]  Your true proving ground for any cigarette.  See if Camel's rich flavor of superbly blended choice tobaccos isn't extra delightful to your  taste.  See if Camel's cool mildness isn't in harmony with your throat.  See if you too don't say Camel's suit my T-zone to a T.  And then the doctor tells you about the C-zone you have in your lungs and all over your neck.  Isn't that amazing, though?  Doctors.  They actually got doctors to endorse. 
[00:26:30]  That long ago, they knew there was a problem, though.  The fact that they would have doctors endorsing it that long ago, they knew.  You're like, why would you go to doctors?  They knew.  Like, why would you go to doctors out of all the people?  Why not, you know, have these construction workers love lucky.  Like, doctors, look, we know this stuff really screws you up, but look, doctors smoke.  Well, no, it happened.  If you know anything about marketing, the word was getting around.  Yeah.  And the cigarette industry needed a big one to help them out.  So they probably did a little payola, plugola with the doctors saying, look, hey, you want 
[00:27:00]  a brand new sports car?  Say something good.  Say something good.  We can't let the word out that people's lungs are turning into Swiss cheese.  Let's go to Bruce.  Could you please give us a little endorsement?  Yeah, let's go to Bruce in Louisiana.  Bruce.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, Bruce.  Yeah, hey, they talk about protecting the children with these ads.  What about when the Flintstones were hawking cigarettes?  Yeah, we played that one.  Well, that's part of it, yeah.  Winston.  It's also, these guys, they have to sign these non-disclosure acts. 
[00:27:30]  You can't talk about anything that you learn in the tobacco.  They're just scumbags.  I mean, they've really dug their own financial grave as far as I'm concerned.  They've been complete scum with the public.  But they're still doing very well.  Absolutely.  And I think it's more worldwide, too, because they don't have to adhere to all those rules.  And people around the world love the American cigarettes.  They're being smashed in the U.S. good, though.  Here's the Flintstones ad.  I don't know.  Smoking's coming back with the kids.  It's coming back with the kids.  Oh, good. 
[00:28:00]  Good to see.  They sure work hard, don't they, Marty?  Yeah.  I hate to see them work so hard.  Yeah, me too.  And let's go around back where we can't see them.  Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.  Okay.  How's about taking a nap?  Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston break.  That's it.  Winston is the one filter cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got that filter blend. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend makes the big taste difference, and only Winston has it up front where it counts.  Here, ahead of the pure white filter, Winston packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially  processed for good flavor in filter smoking.  Yeah, Bonnie, Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  The Flintstone has been brought to you by Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting filter cigarette. 
[00:29:00]  Winston tastes good like a cigarette chute.  Cigarette chute.  How crazy is that?  Yada-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Smoke a Winston.  Everybody smoking.  Get the cancer.  And even back then, Honus Wagner's card is so valuable, that baseball card, because he  had it yanked, because he didn't want to put in cigarette packs because he didn't want  kids smoking. 
[00:29:30]  That's why the Honus Wagner card is so rare.  That's the reason?  Really?  No clue.  He did not want kids buying cigarettes to get his card, and that's why that card is  so...  So rare.  ...fenomenally rare.  So even back in 1911 or whatever that was, 1915...  They just knew.  Yeah, they knew.  Well, now the cigarette ads are a lot different.  Here's the latest one.  And finally, we get to the Cancer Box song.  Listen to this.  You don't always die from tobacco.  Sometimes you just lose a love. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, you don't always die from tobacco.  Sometimes they just sniff out your tongue.  And you won't sing what the heck with a big hole in your neck.  Don't you don't always die from tobacco.  I like it.  Don't always die from tobacco.  Yeah, so you might not be dead, but you'll be talking through one of those.  That, to me, was scary.  That scared me into quitting smoking. 
[00:30:30]  You can't scare a smoker or a drinker into quitting.  That was what got me.  It was the idea of having a piece of my jaw taken out or drooling into a bag.  It wasn't death.  Death is like this intangible thing that none of us can.  Yeah, all right.  When you're dead, you're dead.  But that was like, man, to have to live with a piece of your tongue gone or a piece of your jaw cut out.  That really freaked me out.  Mm-hmm.  Well, there you go.  I'm thinking that maybe the listeners could come up with their own cigarette ads.  It's a good song.  What do you think? 
[00:31:00]  You like that one?  Yeah, I like the voice, but the song is good.  We could give it a try.  Have the listeners come up with their own cigarette ads.  I was trying to see what they died of.  What?  The guys that did the Flintstones.  The voices.  Hopefully they were shot for making an unfunny cartoon.  I hated the Flintstones.  You didn't like the Flintstones, did you?  I hated the Flintstones.  Why?  Hey, Bonnie, shut up.  Why shut up?  It was one of the greatest cartoons ever, Jimmy.  Never made me laugh once.  Based on, you know, the honeymooners. 
[00:31:30]  I know, I know.  It just took a little toodaloo noise that they would make.  That's when they were walking on their tippy toes.  Hated it.  I liked that.  Mel Blanc was harsh.  Bonnie was great.  I just didn't like the Flintstones.  That's too bad.  I know.  Big dumb dinosaur.  Let's say hi to Dan in Youngstown.  Dan, what's up?  There it is.  We had that noise ready.  That's Fred.  That's Fred Bowling.  Hello?  Yeah, Dan, what's up?  Yes, sir.  Hey, I'm a long-time listener. 
[00:32:00]  Appreciate you guys.  A lot of fun.  Who gives that?  I'll see you in the morning.  I wanted to give a response to that Chinese answer you had.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, the Japanese.  It's Japanese.  We know that much.  All right.  Well, it must be.  Dude, the bottom line is this.  The smoking commercials, they've just brought it on themselves.  I have no mercy for them.  All right.  I just don't.  I don't.  I have no mercy.  Even though it's a legal product and you should be able to advertise, I have no mercy for them.  Yeah, but didn't you think like Wilma and Betty were hot?  No. 
[00:32:30]  Pebbles.  They're cartoon characters.  Betty was better than Wilma.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah, Wilma was more of the house wife thing.  Betty had a little wild streak.  No.  Stop.  And her womb was barren.  So they had to adopt Bam Bam.  I saw Betty's Craigslist there.  It said she speaks Greek.  There you go.  All right.  I was ready to yell, hack radio alert, but Jimmy helped us out.  Yeah.  You know, many DJs have done that bit.  Who do you think is the hottest cartoon chick?  Well, take your calls now. 
[00:33:00]  Who do you think is the hottest cartoon chick?  I think Wilma.  What do you think, Anthony?  Velma.  Velma?  Velma from Scooby-Doo.  Why Velma?  Because she seems like she would work harder.  Yeah.  Jimmy, who do you think is the hottest cartoon chick?  Dora the Explorer.  Saving us from hack radio again.  Jim Norton.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the O.B. and Anthony show.  All right.  Let's say hi to Nikki in New York.  Nikki.  I explain sometimes to Rich. 
[00:33:30]  Nikki.  Nikki.  Nikki, New York.  Hello.  Hi.  Hey.  Hi.  So?  You're on the air.  Question, please.  Question.  Okay.  I'm just wondering, do you guys shop at the Stupid People Store to get all your guests on?  The Stupid People Store.  What are you talking about?  I don't think of where that.  Because there's a retards to get on there, and then you guys think they're like so hilarious.  They're stupid.  Who?  Oscar?  You don't like Oscar?  Okay.  Not Oscar.  Not Oscar.  Not Oscar.  All right.  Who are you talking about? 
[00:34:00]  Are you talking about me, Rich Voss?  Okay.  No.  I'm talking about the guy that was just on singing Secret Agent Man.  You don't understand the Secret Agent Man song and the humor in that?  Wait.  Let's...  All right.  So what do you...  What's the problem?  Okay.  So he's like, he's got to be like slightly retarded, right?  Well, she's got to...  All right.  So you're mad because we got someone that's slightly retarded singing Secret Agent Man.  And the segment before that, you're like talking about people with suicide and stuff.  And then you have him on there and you're cracking up at him.  I know.  I actually, to be honest with you, I mean, I'm on the show occasionally. 
[00:34:30]  This is Jim Norton.  And I agree with you.  I think sometimes the segments are very tastelessly mixed.  And I don't like any type of humor being poked in a certain way.  I feel it was handled incorrectly.  Is that kind of what you feel?  Yeah.  Die.  Exactly.  You know, you're talking about suicide and you have a retard guy on there and you're cracking up at him.  Well, did you actually...  I mean, has suicide effect...  I have to tell you, I thought it was really stupid.  It wasn't even funny.  I couldn't agree more.  Have you had somebody in your life commit suicide?  I mean, I think it's a very serious subject. 
[00:35:00]  Yes, I have.  You have?  I'll see.  There you go.  A little close to home.  A little too close to home there, Nikki.  Oh, Nikki, thanks for the laugh.  What happens?  Now, that's awful, Nikki.  Wait, Nikki.  I get, like, regular people on there that other people...  Nikki, did you have to clean up the blood yourself or did you get a cleaning crew?  Who was it, Nikki?  Now, I save it for you so you can come over and lick it up.  Nikki, who was it?  Gotcha.  Nikki, who was it? 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, who was it?  That was just...  My cousin, my cousin.  Okay.  One less C to Thanksgiving.  Who cares?  That's terrific.  And I think that's terrible.  And how did...  What did this poor person do?  Well, what difference does it make?  I'm asking because I've had certain things like that affect my life, too.  What difference does it make?  Whatever joke we're going to say.  I'm not going to joke about it.  I don't think it's funny at all.  No, Jimmy...  Yeah, we'll stay out of this.  Go ahead, Jim.  I don't think it's funny at all.  I've had stuff like that affect...  So was it a cousin you were close to?  No, not really. 
[00:36:00]  Oh.  And what did they do to that person?  So it really shouldn't have affected you.  What's that?  He blew his brains out.  He blew his brains out?  There you go.  Must not have left him much of a mess if he's a relative of yours.  Yeah.  You know, that's okay that you have the laughing machine in the background laughing.  Yeah, that's going to devalue you.  With my laughing machine, I rule the world.  Laughing machine.  What friggin' year are you...  It's probably funny as a nice thing in Secret Agent Man.  Nicky, he blew his brains out. 
[00:36:30]  So what happened?  You know that devalued...  You know that devalued all of his stuff at the garage sale.  Yeah.  No, he hawked all that before we had a chance to do that.  Hey, Nicky.  Hey, what?  Do you realize we weren't even talking really about suicide?  We were talking about a situation where somebody was involuntarily admitted to a hospital.  Like, suicide...  We didn't get in-depth into suicide and the reason...  Like, it wasn't a suicide conversation, Nicky. 
[00:37:00]  You took it as that.  You took it as that.  Yeah, what...  It wasn't a joke thing.  It was a story.  It was a real story.  The show is, like, starting to suck.  Then go listen to something else.  Starting to suck.  How long have you been listening, first of all?  A very long time.  A very long time.  And you listen on XM or on regular radio?  XM.  And you don't know who sang Secret Agent Man?  Long-time listener.  Don't know who that was singing.  Why don't you listen to the same thing your cousin listened to? 
[00:37:30]  A bullet whizzing in.  If your show doesn't get any better, I'll have no choice.  Don't try to be cutting, stupid.  Nicky, you're lying.  You called up.  No one cares.  You're a fibber.  Nicky, let me tell you the reality of being a listener to this show.  You decide it's not for you anymore.  You go away.  Someone takes your place.  Leave.  Someone don't give a crap.  We couldn't be happier.  Don't threaten us.  Don't make it like it's a threat that you're going to leave if we don't get funnier.  We don't want you.  Leave now.  We don't care. 
[00:38:00]  We don't care.  We don't care.  We've been doing this for 12 years.  The only reason you're on the phone is so we can beat you up a little bit.  Nicky, do you have a...  So everyone else can enjoy their morning.  Do you have your XM right there next to you?  No, I don't.  Then what do you...  How did you hear Secret Agent Man?  When I was getting ready for work.  Oh, oh.  I was going to have you turn it up and then change the station so we could actually hear  you not listening to us.  Well, it was so bad that I had a...  I have a joke.  All right.  You want some humor?  I got a...  Jimmy's got a good joke.  I got a joke. 
[00:38:30]  Jimmy's got a joke.  I got...  You want humor?  Shut up.  I got humor.  That's the only thing you get to do different.  You get to curse.  Say, fuck, cunt.  And then, you know, the people love to hear that.  Oh, we're not cursing.  Hey, stupid.  Hey, idiot that's been listening for years.  We're on regular radio right now, you dummy.  You ugly broad.  You're an ugly broad with no head-having cousin.  What do you think of them apples?  What do you think of them apples, headless cousin-haver? 
[00:39:00]  I can't believe Nicky's my cousin.  Did you have to have two boxes at the funeral home?  Ah, shut up.  One for his head and the rest for his body?  Maybe if you were there for him, he wouldn't have done it.  Right.  He wouldn't have combed his hair with a shotgun.  Why don't you take a flying leap, you?  The only...  Hey, she laughs.  She likes to show now.  Two Jews walking to a bar.  Then they shot themselves.  A Polack, a Jew, and an Italian are shooting themselves. 
[00:39:30]  I would have loved to have gone to that wake.  You got the coffin, and then a little hat box to the left.  Oh, I think we have a nomination.  That's right.  A little hat box, hat box.  Oh, that's hilarious.  I don't give a crap about you, your cousin, or your life.  That's right.  We think it's a hoot.  Is your last name Dwyer?  Are you done, Nicky? 
[00:40:00]  Are you done?  No.  No, we could do this all day.  We're going to continue goofing on you and your hatless cousin.  Well, bring it on.  Shut up.  All right, Nicky, why don't you show some dignity and just hang up.  Just hang up.  You've been beaten up already.  Just hang up.  Do what you don't do in your personal life.  Have some self-respect.  You tried to call the radio show.  You're obviously a lonely nothing of a person.  Just have some dignity and hang up.  Hold on a minute.  Here you go, Nicky.  Got this. 
[00:40:30]  This is for you, Buttercup.  There's a man who leads a life of danger.  Everyone he meets, he stays a stranger.  Every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  You like it, Nicky.  Secret Agent Man, Secret Agent Man, they're giving you a number and taking away your name. 
[00:41:00]  That's my favorite part now, by the way.  Way your name.  Have a nice day.  She hung up.  Did she?  I swear to God, she hung up.  I really wish Kenny was related to her as a cousin.  Let me just explain why I can no longer make eye contact with Kenny.  Not only did he not need a lyric sheet, he was holding the mic with both hands and shaking it like he was the third superstar in the Idol Maker.  Who are you, Cesare?  I just want to take you where I'm going. 
[00:41:30]  If anyone remembers that Ray Sharkey movie from the early 80s.  Have a little AIDS, Ray.  Hey, this is Colin Quinn, and you're listening to the worst of O.B. and Anthony.  O.B. and Anthony.  It's degrading.  That is just horrific.  It's a freak show.  Just let the show die, then.  It's the worst of the O.B. and Anthony show.  They should be shot.  And, well, here's the big story that everyone's talking about this morning.  We'll do the news story here, and then we'll comment, I guess. 
[00:42:00]  I don't know what it is.  It was the way he lived his life.  He was shooting a new TV series in North Queensland called Deadly Sea Creatures when he came too close to one.  Rich Voss.  The 44-year-old was swimming at Bat Reef off Port Douglas around 11 when he was struck in the heart by the barb of a stingray.  He came over the top of a stingray, and the stingray's barb went up and went into his chest and put a hole into his heart.  It was likely that he possibly died instantly when the barb hit him. 
[00:42:30]  A rescue helicopter was called, but there was little the medical team could do.  Friend and colleague Trevor Long from SeaWorld says stingray toxin causes your circulation to shut down.  That's good.  There's no antidote to it.  It's just a very horrible venom that we don't know a lot about, and getting hit in the trunk is a bad situation.  Steve Irwin's body was taken to Cairns Hospital, and word spread south swiftly, with 9 News first reporting just after 2 o'clock something terrible had happened to the crocodile hunter.  I know people are shocked about it. 
[00:43:00]  I can't believe it.  Yeah, I know.  Guy ran around sticking his face in crocodile mouths, eventually got smashed by something.  What did you expect?  By something, but the thing is.  Well, yeah.  I mean, he's the type of guy he took a lot of risk, and he probably would have wanted to go out with a croc just ripping his head off or something.  Going in a death row.  Right, but to get.  He's got my head.  To get killed by a stingray.  A stingray.  We've been doing our research this morning, Jimmy.  Yeah, here's a little stat for you. 
[00:43:30]  Since ever.  Since ever.  Since the beginning of ever.  17 people have been killed by stingrays on the planet Earth.  I cannot verify other planets that have a sea full of stingrays.  It's safe to say.  Because we don't know how many exist.  It's safe to say 17 in the known universe.  In the known universe.  The planets are dead because of a stingray.  He's one of them. 
[00:44:00]  I was toiling, trying to find something that people died of, like 16 people died of it, or 15, or one.  Is there something out there that only one person died of?  I think that you, there are more people have actually died being accidentally struck in the temple by Asian testicles.  Probably.  There has to be at least one. 
[00:44:30]  Is that, what is it that is less than 17?  We can't find anything.  Because the ones we got in front of us, there are a lot of people, but statistically, the chances are low.  But there's still a lot of people because there's a lot of people on the Earth.  Right.  I'm really going out on a limb there.  Well, no, but I know what you're saying is there's 17 people total.  I actually read the list.  16, the next 16 down, 16 people in history have been killed by daisies. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  We found out that shark attacks aren't very deadly every year.  A lot of people, more people, we figured, were killed by vending machines falling on them from them trying to tip it over to get their snack out or, you know.  Yeah, that's a true stat.  A swindle.  Yep.  More people are killed by vending machines than by sharks every year.  Well, airplane crashes.  But 30 million Americans describe themselves as anxious flyers. 
[00:45:30]  And, of course, they've got a fear of dying in a plane crash.  It's once every, let's see, a statistical expert in the field of aviation safety, your actual risk of being involved in a fatal airline accident, once every 19,000 years.  That is, provided the person flew on an airplane once a day for 19,000 years. 
[00:46:00]  So if you fly once a day, 19,000 years, you'll probably crash.  Numerically, yes.  Once.  However, on every plane crash, there's somebody whose first flight it is.  Right.  And they're fearful flyers and their friends throw this dumb stat.  Oh, you could fly for 19,000?  Yeah, could I?  And that's the last thought they're thinking as it goes into a cornfield somewhere.  Exactly.  Great.  Fantastic.  Great.  That's exactly what I was worried about.  That's what great.  That's probably not to worry about. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  You're right, Jim.  Now someone else gets 38,000 years.  Right, right.  Because they died on their first flight.  You could have my 18,999 years.  Or whatever it is.  Right, whatever.  I wasn't doing proper math.  I died.  I died.  Get on Hooters Air every day and see if you make it 19,000 years.  Well, here you go.  Stingray.  Well, this is the six most feared but least likely causes of death in front of us.  So it's airplane crashes, shark attacks, being murdered, falling to death. 
[00:47:00]  Being murdered?  Being murdered.  According to the World Health Organization, one person is murdered about every 60 seconds worldwide.  And in 2000, an estimated 520,000 people were murdered in the world.  Although this sounds like a lot, let us put things into perspective.  In 2000, over 6 million people died of cancer.  Yeah, but I'm not even talking.  See, these are the wrong stats.  We're looking.  If one person's murdered every 60 seconds worldwide.  Let's say one person was killed by a stingray every two minutes. 
[00:47:30]  That wouldn't be a lot worldwide.  Right.  But that's a lot.  I mean, it does.  17 in the history of history.  17.  What is that?  One every what?  One every.  Someone do the math.  It's one every.  Like the last time, people were walking around with puffy, powdery wigs, perhaps.  Maybe even earlier than that.  Well, I believe that the world's only about 2,006 years old, so.  Is that it?  So let's just. 
[00:48:00]  You from that school of thought?  Yeah, so why don't we just do the math?  Like Earl?  We've only been existence over 2,000 years.  A little over 2,000 years.  This is dinosaurs with people.  So throw the 17 into that and someone give us a quick figure, okay?  That old gag.  Shut up.  Look at the rocks.  Oh, it's amazing how they discount carbon dating, the religious idiots.  Yeah, look at the rocks.  Being murdered.  Falling to death is up there.  It's falling.  Something we fear, but most likely won't cause our own deaths. 
[00:48:30]  Terrorists and terrorist attack is in there.  And natural disaster.  Natural disaster seems like that's pretty dangerous.  I don't care that it made this list.  Natural disaster, you get something like the tsunami, earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, mudslides,  all that happy stuff that happens all over the world.  I don't care that they're saying 1 in 3,357, your lifetime odds of dying from natural force. 
[00:49:00]  It's still a lot.  Oh, Stingray-related news tease.  Great.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Of course.  Because now they're the most dangerous thing ever with 17 deaths during ever.  They're very creepy-looking, though.  You know why no one dies?  Because no one goes near those creepy-looking.  They're just-  But they always said they look, like, scary, and they got that tail and everything, and  it's pointy.  And you go, ooh, that's scary.  But then the people go, nah.  They say they're harmless. 
[00:49:30]  They won't do anything.  The kids would pet them down at SeaWorld in Orlando.  They have the tanks where you could stick your hand in there and pet the little guys like  they're a puppy, like a puggle.  They're awful.  I'm a little freaked out today because I went down to the Cayman Islands, and why would my headphones  be fixed?  And went scuba diving and snorkeling, you know, a lot of water sports.  You all right there, Anthony?  Yeah, they're okay now.  And then I went on a little adventure called, well, we went to Stingray City. 
[00:50:00]  Stingray City.  And I'm sure there's a bunch of people out there nodding their heads.  They also have gone to Stingray City.  They're all hanging out at the bar right now, tipping some back, laughing about how one got  one over on the big guy.  You go to Captain Ahab's boat, or whatever the hell this guy's name is.  He started this Stingray City tour back in, like, 1950.  He's still doing it.  There's no laws, no regulations, nothing.  No talk about safety.  And then they take you out to this place. 
[00:50:30]  The water is no more than four feet.  Oh, so it's safe.  Crystal clear.  Ah.  And you jump off the back of the boat, and they have food.  Next thing you know, you're completely surrounded by stingrays.  That at any moment could have thrust a spike into your heart.  And they're big, huge doormats.  They're not little ones.  These things are huge.  And they're all over the place.  And I'm thinking to myself, this cannot be safe.  Oh, boy.  But we did it.  And you're petting them.  They encourage you to, you know, dive underwater because you got a little, you know, you got 
[00:51:00]  your mask on there.  And you're petting the Stingrays.  They're taking pictures.  Then there's Captain Ahab, who's been doing it for over 50 years.  He now proceeds to start picking up the huge Stingrays and giving you what's called a back  massage with the Stingrays.  Oh, yeah.  That's good.  Give him a chest massage, too, with the spike.  Right.  Talk about, you know, agitating these guys.  I don't think they want to be out of the water.  But Captain Ahab said it was okay.  So we all lined up to get a little Stingray back massage. 
[00:51:30]  What's that?  He puts it on your back and you feel it.  It's like rubbery, whatever.  And they flapping their little wings or whatever.  And it gives you a nice quick little back rub.  But they're flapping like crazy because they want to be back in the water.  Because they don't want to be on your back.  And they're moments away from showing you what that dagger could do.  Thrusting that dagger into your chest.  No clue whatsoever.  I'm thinking it's the safest thing in the world.  But, you know, and I was reading about Stingrays over the weekend.  And most of the times when they do attack is when you step on them. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  Well, when you're in four feet of water and there's probably close to a hundred around you,  it's pretty easy to step on one of these things.  And then what do they lay that thing into you like your calf or something, I bet.  Who knows?  You step on it.  They flip their tail up.  Foof.  But people are getting confused.  A Stingray has that long tail.  Yeah.  It's not the actual tail that gets you.  It's not at the tip of the tail.  No, it's in the middle of that.  It's sort of in the middle of the tail.  All of a sudden there's, where's the picture?  Here it is, Jimmy.  In the middle of the tail, this thing comes out.  It's like an eight to ten inch, like bony. 
[00:52:30]  It looks like a dagger.  Yeah.  And that's what got Steve Irwin.  Ew.  They're just creepy, prehistoric monsters.  We were talking about that when stupid Bob Kelly was talking about his snoober, his snoober-ing,  where he would, Opie's talking about scuba diving and going down to these wrecks and,  you know.  I mean, I'm not, I mean, I'm a beginner.  I mean, when I tell my scuba diving stories, there are people out there laughing at me too. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  But at least I got to laugh at stupid Bob Kelly and his snoober adventure.  You're self-contained.  That's the, you know, that's the SC part of scuba.  Right.  You're self-contained.  You're alone.  You're, you're, you're there, you know, it's you and the elements and you're, you're in  the ocean.  He's talking about, oh, dude, I did this snoober, dude.  And he's making it sound like he's the new chocker.  And it's like snoober is when they take what is pretty much a long snorkel.  It's a snorkel thing that goes in your mouth with a tube that goes up to the surface. 
[00:53:30]  That's hanging on a little floaty.  So you can go down about 20 feet.  I think the tank's hanging on a floaty.  Yeah, a floaty.  It's not scary if.  Dude, I snoober, dude.  It's not scary if you're underwater and you could hear the guys on the boat that took  you out to this adventure, you know, ordering their lunch.  Yeah.  I mean, you know.  Snoober is when you put on like, it's like when you put on, what do they call the head  things that keep your eyes clear?  The mask.  Snoober is actually, you put on goggles and you're in the front seat of a car and then  you bob your head into the lap of a gentleman. 
[00:54:00]  That's what snoober is.  Snoober.  And stupid Bob will pontificate, dude, you know, stingrays.  I guarantee you right now he's reading about stingrays and he'll bore somebody he's working  with.  Dude, statistically, shut up.  He's rehearsing what he's going to be saying.  Always.  Always.  Dude, you know, the stingray, relatively harmless, dude.  At the cellar, I told you, we mentioned John Travolta and we, no, well, he got his planes  actually before, uh, before he did Pulp Fiction.  Nah, dude, he got them after.  And so I was like, no, no, he had them before. 
[00:54:30]  And his, he was so rehearsed.  He couldn't deviate from that fact.  He can't go off script.  All right.  There's nothing.  We're late.  We got to take a break.  The phones, they're lit.  A lot of people on hold, they want to comment about this story and, uh, and stingrays in general.  I don't know.  I saw somebody that said, uh, we'll do it after the break.  Oh, he hung up.  Ah, damn it.  Well, that guy should call back too.  I wasn't.  Cody in Dallas, I did the math in 2000 years, a stingray kills someone every 117 years.  Look out.  They are the new SARS.  17 years. 
[00:55:00]  Right.  And that's only going back to the, the year zero going back to the year of our Lord.  What's up, Matt?  Yeah.  My dad died last year when I told my kids they were upset for about 15 minutes.  Yesterday, my kids were inconsolable.  They cried all fricking day.  Yeah, I had to explain what was going on to them.  I mean, they got upset when, I learned their birthday times when they found out Grandpa wasn't going to give him anything, but.  How old are your kids?  Five and seven.  I wouldn't even have, I wouldn't even have told them. 
[00:55:30]  Nah, you don't tell them.  The reruns will run forever on TV.  They won't know the difference.  Why do people tell their kids stuff like that?  Huh?  It was on the TV.  They heard it.  They don't understand.  You tell them he's making a movie.  Yeah.  It's part of his movie.  It's part of his movie.  Dude, why do they like him better than your father?  Was your father, would he sneak over?  Was he like a croc hunter of a different type?  Was he like a stingray?  The kids got too close and his spike came out?  There you go.  Stupid me.  I do a wordplay joke when you come out with that brilliant line. 
[00:56:00]  All right.  Well, the kids are sad today.  The kids are sad today.  And I didn't tell them.  It was just all over the news.  No, I know.  The radio.  Once again, making a joke there.  Obviously, they couldn't avoid the death of the croc hunter.  And all Australia really has is this guy and the crocodile Dundee.  That's pretty much the only two people that are the ambassadors from Australia.  They have lost 50% of their celebrities.  That's it. 
[00:56:30]  That stingray took half of their celebrity status.  They took a big hit.  Well, I'm just going to let them watch cartoons so I don't have to deal with this again.  Yes.  A nuclear bomb could hit Hollywood and we'd still have more celebrities than Australia.  Right.  Who else?  Who do they have left?  They have Crocodile Dundee, but how old is he?  And Olivia Newton-John.  She can hum Xanadu.  Who cares about her?  All right.  Thank you, Matt.  The kids are sad today.  Yes.  Bill from Waterford Dudes.  I was out.  No.  Where was your other one, Bill?  Stingray would have done that to her.  It would have been nothing to hit. 
[00:57:00]  I missed it.  Well, possibly there would have been nothing to do.  Who knows?  50-50 shot.  Where was the other one, Bill?  Where it counts.  Bill had a really good one and I can't find it now, but basically they have video of Steve  Irwin.  Yes.  It was being taped for a special that he was taping for his kids show.  He had like a little kids show.  And there was a cameraman right in front of him.  And it was showing Steve Irwin swimming toward the camera with this huge bull stingray underneath 
[00:57:30]  him.  And I guess from the cameraman being in front and Steve Irwin coming over the top, the  stingray felt boxed in, had nowhere to go.  And he flipped that stinger up and got Steve Irwin right in the chest.  The barb.  The barb went right in his chest, put a palm-sized hole in his heart.  But Steve Irwin actually pulled it out.  He was underwater.  He was alive long enough to pull the stinger out. 
[00:58:00]  And then that's when the cameraman saw some blood and he was motionless and that was it.  He was done.  He tried to talk in the boat or something.  By the way, why don't they just show it?  I mean, they showed 9-11 footage.  They show every other earthquake, tsunami footage on television.  Why are we...  We might not get to see this one.  Two schools of thought here.  His wife said the network actually owns the footage, Discovery.  So they say they're going to let the wife have the final say in this.  I'm sure there will be money offered.  There will be things, you know, negotiated and a lot of hype around this. 
[00:58:30]  If they ever do show this on Discovery, it's going to be prefaced with a whole, his career  and everything and warnings about...  And coming up...  Very special.  Very special.  We are sure...  And we want you to know that this is not sensationalizing anything.  This is educational and blah, blah, blah.  But they don't show you the negotiations behind closed doors with Steve Irwin's wife or widow.  Yeah.  Saying, hey, you're going to still have to pay for the college education.  No, this is a good money.  He went like he wanted to.  And, you know, he would have wanted people to see this. 
[00:59:00]  That these animals protect themselves like this, even against people and...  How much?  It's going to come out that he had no experience as far as the animals in the water.  You watch.  What happened?  They put a too hot for TV bubble over the blood like they do on the stupid reality shows.  Ow, that had a hurt on Max X.  Right, right.  Here's Steve Irwin, the guy who makes any horrific death sound like it's something cool and extreme. 
[00:59:30]  Ugh.  But you wait, though.  The experts will probably be on TV this morning saying he had no business being in the water with these creatures.  Already have been.  They have, right?  That have come out and said...  Because he was trying to expand his own little world.  He knew all about the crocs and stuff like that.  But I think that was getting kind of old.  Yep.  He did pretty much everything he could, including dangling his little newborn in front of the croc.  In front of a croc like a chicken.  Which, by the way, I had no problem with.  Yeah, who cares?  You know, it's obvious he was a loving father, if you know anything about Steve Irwin. 
[01:00:00]  Yeah.  And his father was an adventurer, too.  It just runs in the family.  But I think he was running out of adventures and said, well, let's go to the sea.  So the guy said he was a victim of this voyeuristic, reality-driven television that has also infiltrated the animal shows like this, where you have to top yourself.  And, yeah, he did a lot of the land-based reptile things.  He was a reptile expert, is really what he was.  Crocodiles, snakes, things like that.  He'd been bitten by a lot of snakes. 
[01:00:30]  Remember that one clip he gets bit right in the face?  Mm-hmm.  And he's like, oh, no, he was just scared.  It's all right.  I got into his territory.  And then he figured he'd expand it.  So it was kind of goofy to see him in those khakis and the shorts.  And he'd just jump off his boat in there.  He wouldn't wear a wetsuit or anything.  He'd wear the same stuff he wears, like, in the Outback.  And not the steakhouse, by the way, the real Outback.  Yeah.  The dirty one.  I bet you it's going to come out, they're going to say that he talked to the experts. 
[01:01:00]  And they told him the stingrays aren't dangerous.  They don't kill people.  But it looks pretty awesome when that dagger flies out, when they feel threatened.  And I bet you that was the shot they were going for.  Probably.  Kind of like when, you know, he wants the croc to kind of, you know, move forward and then snap at him a little bit.  Yeah, go into a death roll.  I bet you they show it on a Discovery special.  Now they're going to go fade to black right at the moment.  They'll lead right up to it, saying this is him jumping off the boat.  Here's him with the stingrays. 
[01:01:30]  And then they're going to show you the stingray and go, there's the stingray that got him.  And then it's just going to fade to black.  YouTube.  They should show it.  YouTube.  It'll end up on YouTube.  Take it over the world.  I'm going to leak it to YouTube.  Do a special called Take That Show Off.  Enough already.  We're acting like the guy who's working on brain tumors died.  Some stupid Aussie running around in a pair of shorts.  Blah!  Animal!  Blah!  Shut up!  Guy wasn't a hero.  He was some dumb TV host.  I know you spoke Australian.  Yeah, that's exactly what he said.  That was very impressive, Jimmy. 
[01:02:00]  They're a little shrimp!  Blah!  Oh, it's a tragedy, is it?  You think he's in heaven going, you've got to be kidding me.  This is the way I went?  Why couldn't it be a croc just ripping my skull right off my body?  Exactly.  Actual leading causes of death.  Leading causes?  Yeah.  We're trying to figure out how rare this stingray thing is.  We've learned 17 people.  17 people have died in ever, ever, ever.  Do you realize Robert Reed killed more people throwing a barb in to him than stingrays have? 
[01:02:30]  He's got too close to him and he got nervous.  And as the backside tried to clear him, his barb went up in defense.  It's a very slow 10-year death.  Just wanted to tussle that white man's afro.  And whoosh!  Uh, Fontaine in Michigan, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Great replay yesterday.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah, it was awesome.  Hey, I think I know of something that's killed fewer people. 
[01:03:00]  I'm going to tread lightly.  All right.  Remember that video of the guy making love to a horse?  Oh, yeah.  I don't even know if you can say that much, but, uh...  I don't know!  Yeah, there's...  Steve Irwin is in a snuff film!  Yeah, there's a video of a guy being killed by a horse.  Being killed by a horse, and it ain't from a kick to the head.  I want to go on record and say that more people have died having sex with horses than by stingrays.  I would absolutely say that.  More people this year have died from that. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  You're talking 17 people over the course of recorded history.  There isn't even a hieroglyphic of some little guy with his hands doing the walk like the Egyptian thing, getting stung by a stingray.  That's how old they can go back and see that it just doesn't happen.  Actual leading causes of death.  Illicit use of drugs.  17,000 a year.  Sexual behaviors. 
[01:04:00]  Only 20,000 a year.  Ooh.  Incidents involving firearms.  29,000 a year.  Car crashes.  43,000 a year.  Coming in at number five.  This is for the United States, by the way.  Toxic agents.  55,000.  What's a toxic agent?  A toxic agent?  Give me an example of a toxic agent.  Poisoning.  You're somehow getting poisoned.  I would assume. 
[01:04:30]  What's the next one there?  Zero on that one.  What's the next one?  Microbial agents.  Microbial agents.  All right.  Microbial agents, I think.  Microbial.  Microbial agents.  All right.  That sounds good.  75,000 a year.  Alcohol consumption.  You Alkis out there.  85,000 deaths a year.  Or 3.5% of all deaths a year from alcoholism.  Oh, but go after the video games, you politicians. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, you're getting something done out there, aren't you?  Probably over cocktails, discussing how bad video games are.  Right.  These politicians are a bunch of dopes.  Dummy.  Yeah, concentrate on terrorist attacks, because that's a real threat in this country.  Poor diet and physical inactivity.  400,000 deaths a year.  Yep.  That's all the heart attacks, I'm assuming.  16.6% of all deaths.  And diabetes.  When I get my medical supplies for my diabetes. 
[01:05:30]  And, of course, because of all the attention it gets, yes, video games kill 435,000 people a year.  That's 18.1% of all deaths in America every year.  There you go.  Video games?  Did you get a different copy than me?  Actually, if you add up how many video games.  I can't stomach these dopey politicians anymore going after these dumb causes, thinking it's an epidemic.  Shut up.  They should add up how many video game people die in the video games and try to sell it that way. 
[01:06:00]  Do you know how many virtual people were killed in video games?  I probably wiped out, like, hundreds of thousands in my career.  Hillary Clinton and Chuck Shoemaker going after the violent video games.  Why don't you take on the tobacco industry and see what happens to you?  They are.  They say, don't you smoke.  Yeah, whatever.  Come on, kids.  Tobacco, 435,000 deaths a year.  Do you realize if she, like, hung upside down, all the blood would rush from her fat calves and ankles, 
[01:06:30]  and her head would just blow off.  I like to see that.  Like a bat.  All right.  But this morning, stingrays are all the rave.  Experts say stingray attacks are rare, but just how rare?  And are you in danger the next time you take a dip?  Is this another situation where you have to be afraid to go to the beach?  We're going to ask the doctor.  That's coming up next hour.  God, that's the doctor.  Whoever that woman is, I hope she's now dead. 
[01:07:00]  The fact that those 17 people in recorded history, how about this?  People might be concerned about stingrays.  There's 17 people in recorded history have died from them.  Next story.  Why do we have to wait for the doctor?  Well, you know, you might want to just exercise a little caution.  Shut up.  Why?  We don't want people, you know, getting panicked like they did when the movie Jaws came out  and kill sharks that really don't kill many people.  Stingray's very harmless. 
[01:07:30]  Shut up.  Do we have the story?  Because I'm sure that story's ridiculous.  Does Danny have it?  He's got to have that.  Danny.  I'd like to take a nice 100 milligram Viagra, and I'll go in a stingray city, and I'll show  them who's boss.  Start stinging back.  Absolutely.  They look, Opie and Anthony are on TV.  Oh, God.  Crocodile Hunter remembered, and they got two experts from Sydney, Australia.  It's on the CBS early show.  Just like Anthony and I.  It's me and Opie. 
[01:08:00]  We're Australian.  That's the Australian Opie and Anthony talking about Steve Irwin.  I got F'd up, so I got to get smashed here.  You said Chuck Schumacher?  Yeah, I was so excited with what I wanted to say.  He's a great horse racer.  I was finally making a very valid point, and I...  Just squint.  Look, we're on TV.  Oh, someone's got to screen cap that, man.  Well, we did the 06 for same thing, and they...  Screen cap this. 
[01:08:30]  It's on CBS as we speak.  We'll get it up on OpieandAnthony.com so you people can enjoy, too.  That's funny.  The Australian Opie and Anthony.  Oh, those two fools.  What buffoons we are.  Well, at least Opie gets to do all the talking during this piece, though.  Hey, what happened?  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  I said Chuck Schumacher instead of Chuck Schumer.  I was getting excited, though.  I was fighting one for the kids there. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, come on.  I got a little too excited.  I'm sorry.  Yes, it's Chuck Schumer.  I can't get over how funny that is.  We've got to screen cap it.  Let's see.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Oh, yeah.  This is always something you wonder.  Steve in Queens.  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  You're talking about the whole voyeuristic thing.  I wonder how long the cameraman kept filming.  How long he kept shooting.  Like, did he drop the camera and immediately try to help, or did he just keep filming the whole thing after he was gone? 
[01:09:30]  I think, from what I heard, he had filmed it because he didn't know anything happened until he saw some blood.  So I assume he filmed up until blood started coming out, which means you probably see him pulling the spike out of his chest and then kind of going limp.  Imagine Steve Irwin had something crazy in his thing there.  What is it called?  His will.  And that he wants his body, like, fed to the Crocs.  He wants to do it in front of the kids at his zoo in Australia. 
[01:10:00]  Hey.  It's kind of sick.  Imagine how it was his.  It was his wish.  Can you imagine?  Man.  It's like, hey, it was his wish.  They lower his.  I don't think they'd do that.  They lower his body into it.  And just watch him get torn apart.  Hey, it was his wish, man.  He wanted to be ripped apart by Crocs.  Right.  Well, people do all the other dopey things.  Yeah.  Spreading the ashes, you know, where you swim and stuff. 
[01:10:30]  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.  He must have just been like that.  Great.  Great.  Your grandma loved the Long Island Sound.  But, you know, I like to swim there.  Yeah, I know.  Can we keep the oceans clear of people's ashes?  Yeah, could you please?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  He must have just been like, boom, wham.  Oh, man.  What the hell is that?  Oh, boy.  This is how it ends.  That can't be good.  This is how it ends.  Opie and Anthony.  You're listening to the worst. 
[01:11:00]  Worst.  Hey, this is Richard Draftis, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This is the fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's pretty stupid.  Oh, we love when people cry.  It's one of our favorite things to play on the show.  Men are more fun than women on TV.  Yeah, when ballplayers retire and they just lose it in front of the media.  Baseball, you know, it's a career I've had for many years.  They do that, and you just know they're losing it.  And this team's been like, family to me. 
[01:11:30]  They don't know how to just cry.  They try to get through it.  Well, they know how to cry.  They don't want to cry in front of everyone.  It's a sport that I've devoted my entire life to, and I believe it's a part of my life.  Get it out.  45 years of holding it in because dad smacked you in the face when you dropped the fly ball.  That's a little eager.  You cried once at eight and got that crap beat out of you.  Now you're 45, and I just want to say to my dad, I made it. 
[01:12:00]  I wish my dad were here to see this.  He's alive, but he's in jail for job pornography trafficking.  There was a sports writer in New York that just killed us in his column because we made fun of, I don't know, one of these ball players retiring, and they were crying. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah.  How could you not make fun of that?  You got to.  They're big, burly men.  Big, burly men, and they're breaking down in front of the media because they had a great career.  I forgot.  Was it Phil?  Phil Mushnick?  Oh, Mushnick.  Phil Mushnick got mad at us.  Phil Mushnick got mad at us.  What a curmudgeon he is.  Because we like to play the audio of these guys breaking down.  They all start the same way.  It's them sitting, and they give the big breath.  Well, it's a big moment for me.  They acknowledge this is going to be tough for me.  It's going to be a tough one. 
[01:13:00]  Hands are on the podium.  They're looking down for a second.  Had a great career, but I'm here to announce my retirement from the game.  It's been many years.  Met many people, good people, that I've worked with over the years to think that it's over.  You know why they're crying, too, because they're not on the road anymore getting ass in every city.  Nope.  They're going home to their fat wife that let herself go after having her fourth kid with the guy. 
[01:13:30]  They're not good at doing the commentary, so they don't have that gig.  Right.  They're like, oh, man, I'm stuck in the house.  What am I going to do?  I'm stuck in the house with this pig.  It was horrible.  Instead of sleeping with the baseball groupies.  I look at some of these young gentlemen just starting in the game, and I think,  what a piece of ass he's got.  My wife let herself go, she's a slob. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, she's a pig.  I used to get him nice and young in every city.  Had a butt like a snare drum.  Now, my wife looks like she's been sitting in a gravel driveway.  She takes off her pantyhose.  The room smells like a dragon roll. 
[01:14:30]  So Katie's crying.  Don't take it for granted.  Boys, don't ever take it for granted this game.  I know a lot of youngsters watching me out here.  I've inspired a few.  They've told me, get as much tang as you can, boys.  This great game that was started so many years ago, and then they made us play with blacks.  That one got closer to Kenny laughing.  Of course it did. 
[01:15:00]  Of course it did.  We used to tune them up.  That's right.  We called that the good old days.  Yeah, we know.  We know.  When a cop could be a cop.  It's no more fun on the job anymore.  All these people with cell phone cameras.  You can't even have a little fun anymore.  You can't even swing a nightstick into someone's soup coolers. 
[01:15:30]  Of course Kenny's laughing in the background.  He's been stone-faced for like two weeks.  Of course he's laughing at this.  He watches Mississippi Burning the way we watch Caddyshack.  Look at him.  He thinks it's terrific.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  What's going on with Danny?  He seems very pissed off.  He was so pissed off he decided to wreck our naked man superhero bit because he couldn't wait any longer. 
[01:16:00]  He tried to, but there's no ruin in that.  I think he was pitching himself as the sidekick.  There's no ruining that bit.  Where do we begin with this?  Okay.  First, with a description of Danny today, as opposed to Danny on any other given day.  Danny on any given day would be dressed like?  Yeah, that's a good...  Like?  Like a dirt bag?  Like a dirt bag.  Yeah, which, let me tell you, there is no problem with that.  Your hair, usually, you know, just woke up, kind of do. 
[01:16:30]  A t-shirt with some type of logo on it.  Some type of the dead shirt.  That, yeah, that shows that you got it for free somewhere.  Slayer t-shirt or something.  Yeah, something like that.  Pants?  I don't notice what type of pants he wears on a daily basis.  Jeans that...  Is it just jeans?  That haven't been washed in weeks.  A while.  And...  Rotting sneakers.  Footwear, just sneakers.  Rotting.  Rotting sneakers.  Wallet with that big chain as if...  Yeah, wallet with a chain.  Right.  A chain wallet.  And then, uh, unshaven just about every day. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Just about every day.  How is he dressed today, Anthony?  Uh, wow.  Khaki.  I see you have some khakis on.  Dress pants.  There is a brown...  They're kind of grayish brown, I guess.  Your khakis.  There's a brown shirt that you're wearing.  And it's one of the...  It's a golf shirt.  It's collared.  It's a collared golf shirt.  He looks like he's managing Home Depot.  Right.  Bingo.  That is the exact look of a Home Depot manager. 
[01:17:30]  B.J.'s whole...  Yeah.  Whatever the hell it is.  Warehouse.  And he's got his, uh, a belt on.  He's wearing a belt.  And on that belt is clipped his cell phone on one side.  And his ID, his company ID on the other.  So he could get into the various doorways.  Very clean shaven.  Very clean shaven.  His hair washed and slicked back.  Yeah, he's got some kind of hair product in that is keeping his hair back and in place. 
[01:18:00]  And he has his sunglasses very fashionably tucked in the, um...  Very 80s.  V-neck of his, uh...  Collared shirt.  Collared shirt.  What kind of shoes you got on?  Well, I didn't...  I didn't have any shoes, so I'm just wearing my old boots.  Yeah, but they're black and you must have wiped them off.  I contemplated it, but I said, ah, screw it.  Because there's really no dirt on them.  Yeah, they look fine.  In the boots, actually.  This is his alter ego, Bob.  And, uh...  Bob, Bob.  This is the naked man's alter ego. 
[01:18:30]  Very good, Bob.  And, uh, your watch, you usually wear that?  Yes, I do.  Okay, it's very nice, very fashionable.  By the way, is your dad Naked Man the superhero?  Yes, actually, he could quite possibly be.  We learned a lot about Danny in the last few months, and, uh, we found out that his father  likes to be naked all the time.  Yeah, he just kind of hangs out naked.  All the time.  Anyway, why are you dressed like this?  Yeah.  I know, but I only found out around 5.15 this morning.  This is a bit of brilliance on the part of, uh, other people. 
[01:19:00]  Um, yeah, why are you dressed like this?  Oh, because I was told that we actually are going to be having a dress contract.  There's a dress code implemented around here.  Listen to Ben.  Ben's in charge.  Look, I love when Ben laughs uncontrollably, because then I sit there and go, but Ben,  you're the one in charge, and all hell's breaking loose around you.  Now, Danny, who told you there was going to be a dress code? 
[01:19:30]  Everyone.  Everyone being, uh, let's see, Ben.  Ben.  Steve.  Steve.  Uh, Thanimal.  Van.  And, uh, and, uh, and the newly shaven Travis.  Travis?  Yeah, well, Derek, well, because Derek's the one that blew the whole gag in the first  place.  That's what gave me an inkling that this was a whole bit in the first place.  Did you go, uh-oh, what happened?  Because dumb Travis goes, I, I, I can't really.  Dumb Travis who's dressed like he dresses every day as opposed to you.  I can't really.  He's like, I can't really talk about it.  Call Derek.  Derek, but they failed to fill Derek in yet. 
[01:20:00]  Oh.  So when I called Derek, he goes, what are you talking about?  And then all of a sudden, I just hear silence.  And then, oh, that.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  Dude, everyone's pissed.  But it's already too late.  And obviously, you weren't completely sure, because you're dressed really nice today.  Well, you know, when you hear it from eight different people, it's like, oh, I guess I'll  see what's going on tomorrow.  These guys bust balls behind the scenes constantly.  There's pranks and hijinks going on all the time. 
[01:20:30]  It's a daily gang rape that you consistently show up to.  Anthony and I leave, like, minutes after the show's over every day.  And that's when the fun really begins with these guys behind the scenes.  The plotting and the planning.  They're just trying to get each other all the time.  Yes, Than.  Than.  Now, did you smell bit before or after you went pants shopping?  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah, because we found out that he doesn't own this stuff.  He doesn't own anything.  He had to go out and get nice clothes.  Yeah, you know.  He bought slacks.  Went to the store, bought some slacks, Bill. 
[01:21:00]  Slacks.  Bought slacks.  And the shirt.  And the shirt.  I don't own this crap either.  What did that set you back?  Well, luckily, I'm frugal.  I shop at TJ Maxx.  Ah, okay.  I was going to guess the Sears Roebuck.  How much?  Like, 50 bucks.  50 bucks?  Yeah.  You don't...  Probably not in a position where you could just throw away 50 bucks.  No, not really.  That's my Con Ed, Bill.  No, not really.  By the way, Rob, from his mobile device, it's radio, a-hole.  Why would it matter what you're wearing?  That's what I'm thinking the whole time. 
[01:21:30]  I'm like, dude, this doesn't make any sense.  I knew it was bit...  Then I show up this morning, and I'm like...  And Steve's wearing his, you know, his regular workout attire.  And I'm just like, oh, let me guess.  Showing those guns.  Yeah, let me guess.  This doesn't apply to you guys, right?  Oh, no, no, no.  I gotta be honest.  Steve is the only one that thinks about what he's gonna wear before he gets in here.  Yeah, but not in a business-like way.  No.  In a way to show off his arms and tattoos and how big he's getting.  He's all about showing off his arms.  Yeah.  Boy.  Yeah, he's all about dressing like Freddie Mercury. 
[01:22:00]  I have not seen that much chest hair in my life.  Freddie Mercury.  Oh, forget it.  He's got a shave, like, up to his neck.  Like, he's got a neckline shave where the chest hair comes in.  I think he has a barber's chair.  And some old man comes in with that leather strap and that straight...  Straight razor?  Yeah.  So, uh...  Bares him up down to his navel.  Well, this all started with an email.  We're gonna, like, have a meeting soon just to see how everything's going.  Yeah.  You know, to see how it's going back on commercial radio and all that.  And that's when Ben and the gang decided this would be a good time to kind of screw Daniel over. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah, like a meeting with the bosses to go over any of our needs.  Because then you ask what the meeting's about and they said something like,  Tom is not happy about how people are dressing around here.  Yeah, it was, like, part of it.  Something like...  Because Tom is always so well-dressed.  Tom is, like, dressed to the nines every day.  Suit, tie, like, fitted suits.  Slacks.  Guy's got, like, gazillion dollars' worth of suits.  And you're kind of intimidated walking up to him dressed like a slob, probably. 
[01:23:00]  I would think.  I would think if you're then told that there's gonna be a meeting involving Tom about a dress code,  that you're then thinking, oh, my God, this guy wears, like, suits that cost thousands.  I gotta go to TJ Maxx and pick up some slags.  Yeah.  I mean, plus, you know, I guess they did a good job of filling everybody in on it.  So, you know, no matter who I called...  They all know, yeah.  But here is the major flaw in their... 
[01:23:30]  I mean, obviously, I guess the...  Major flaw.  Major flaw.  As you're sitting there in brand new clothes that you went out and bought yesterday afternoon.  The victim is sitting there.  Yeah, that's a major flaw, right?  The major flaw.  He's dressed like he's going to a PTA meeting.  Major flaw is you fell for the entire thing.  I say it's a minor flaw at best.  Yeah, what is the little tiny flaw?  The thing that made me think something was awry, so to speak, was that no one could give me a story.  Like, it was all very, very...  But you didn't have enough confidence.  They didn't need...  That's perfect for this crew, because no one ever has the story in this crew. 
[01:24:00]  It's always vague.  Yeah, somebody...  Look at him trying to downplay it.  You're in brand new clothes.  You didn't have enough confidence to come in, dress like you usually dress.  You thought in the back of your head that this could be real, so I better dress appropriately.  Plus, it's a lot harder to get eight people on the exact same lie, so just keep it vague.  There, see, and then the stories don't get tripped up.  Oh, a little roll of the ice from Danny.  I saw that.  I think he's a little upset.  He's not happy.  He's very pissed. 
[01:24:30]  Let me tell you, there's going to be hell to pay, because this all goes back and forth,  so now Danny's going to come up with some retaliation.  He's plotting.  You can see it.  It's...  It's all right.  By the way...  Once in a while, somebody just makes an ass out of you.  I mean, it just happens.  Bert from Philly again.  He's a regular.  Dressed to the nines.  Is that a 1940s reference?  What the F does that mean?  Dressed to the nines.  23 Skidoo. 
[01:25:00]  He's dressed to the nines and smoking Lucky Strike cigarettes in his brand new slacks.  Always have a pack of Lucky's or Chesterfields in the pants pocket of my slacks.  Anthony had his first drink at a speakeasy.  Yeah.  Had to have the right knock.  All right.  The thing opened up.  Is payback going to be a bitch there, Danny?  Well, probably not since, you know, the little sewing circle will never get on my slacks. 
[01:25:30]  Oh!  You left out?  He's like naked man.  He's just alienated from public.  Is there a click?  Well, Than, comment.  Little sewing circle.  Is there a click going on?  It's forming.  I think of you guys all as the same.  Pieces of crap.  Like, there's no hierarchy.  When I look at you, you're all equally worthless to me.  Well, thank you, Anthony. 
[01:26:00]  No problem.  Not as far as work goes.  I mean, of course, you guys do your job.  You do it very well.  As far as just your worth in life and how it affects me and my life, again, not through work.  Just in life.  You're equally, Travis, you are the same piece of garbage as Than, as Danny.  It just doesn't matter to me.  Well, there's clicks, but they're always shifting.  Like, for instance, two days ago, we locked Travis out of the office and it posted false comments from his MySpace account. 
[01:26:30]  Was he looking in, watching it happen in horror?  I wasn't happy.  And after about 25 seconds, he just goes, oh, he gets the, okay, bit's over, stop messing with me, look.  And that's when it gets even more fun.  That's when it's supposed to get more fun.  That's when the joke begins.  Right.  There's something every day.  I mean, there was one day, who was it that sent out the MySpace bulletin that such and such was getting married to Poe?  That was me.  Yeah, that was Travis.  That was me that was getting married to Poe, by the way. 
[01:27:00]  That was a good one.  Hey, by the way, Tim in California has a good observation.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, what are you guys doing?  I'm insulting about half of your audience by saying that we all look like dirtbags.  That's somewhere.  Yeah, our audience dresses like Danny's dress today.  Of course.  Of course.  I just don't have a chain drive wallet.  That's about it.  It's called dressing comfortably.  You're very comfortable.  All right.  Just take the joke, Tim.  Come on. 
[01:27:30]  And what they do also is they'll leave each other's e-mails open.  They'll forget, like walk away from the computer, and then I could be guaranteed to get an e-mail that night from one of the crew who, of course, found somebody else's e-mail open.  And it's usually something like, hey, Anthony, it's Travis here.  The appearance went real well the other day.  I was thinking, you know, maybe me and you could hang out, go out to dinner.  I think we have a lot in common.  You're so funny.  And it's one of these idiots on his e-mail just typing. 
[01:28:00]  So I'll type back something.  You know, hey, that sounds like a great idea.  You know, let's make a date of it, see when your calendar's free, and if I'm not shooting myself in the face that day, I might be able to make it.  Something like that.  So one day they left Danny's open and typed something.  I can't even remember what it was.  But I was so pissed that day, I just wrote F off on the thing and used the entire word.  And for like a day and a half, two days, Danny actually thought I was mad at him because I didn't add some witty little thing. 
[01:28:30]  Well, because usually you get more.  It was just F off.  It was just that.  So I'm thinking, oh, man, maybe this is finally the day they pissed.  I thought I'd change it up a little bit.  All right, we're going to break and catch up a little bit.  So Danny, all right?  Yeah, I'm just waiting for tomorrow.  Maybe I'll switch my coffee with decaf or something.  Hey, this is Chris Carter from The X-Files, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language. 
[01:29:00]  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-CANADA, 877-438-9677.  The virus is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got Patrice O'Neill in for Jim Norton today.  Good morning.  Good morning.  And I was looking at this thing.  It's like the top internet searches. 
[01:29:30]  And the top ten is a little weird.  But it also shows that the entire nation just loves sex.  We just love sex.  Oh, yeah.  We love sex on the internet.  We love sex on the radio.  We love sex on TV.  We love sex in the office.  We love sex everywhere and anywhere.  I love that number one.  I don't know if you – number one.  Yeah, we'll get into that really fast.  I just want to quickly do the list.  I don't want to – number ten, top internet searches, the word Christmas. 
[01:30:00]  Of course, holiday season.  But what would you look up as far as Christmas goes on the internet?  This has to be like all the – I don't know, the housewives or something.  Just Christmas?  Yeah, that's like one of the top internet searches today.  Well, probably, you know, recipes, Christmas – anything that – you know, Christmas,  holiday cooking, holiday ideas for decorating probably just covers an entire –  But I guess what I'm getting at is like dudes are not throwing Christmas into a search engine on the internet. 
[01:30:30]  Well, what do dudes search – that's why – read the rest and you'll see what dudes are looking at.  Well, I know.  I understand that.  That's why Christmas is number ten.  Because look, that's number one.  All right, so Christmas is number ten.  Then you got the Nintendo Wii.  Do you got a Wii yet?  I haven't been able to –  The Wii.  I want to get it just to get it.  That was pretty good.  I don't want the Wii.  You don't want the Wii?  Nah, PS3.  Some type of exercise going on with it.  What?  The Wii?  Yeah.  You got to do that with the hand thing. 
[01:31:00]  You can actually box.  You're boxing with the silly hand thing.  Yeah, you burn some calories.  Man's got the Wii.  I want it just to have it.  Yeah.  Just to know I can have it.  Well, that's one –  And never use it.  By the way, PlayStation 3, only the 20th word thrown into the old search engine.  I think people – after people were getting shot outside of Target and Walmart, it just kind of –  Yeah.  People are just like, it's not worth it.  They've been going crazy over those things.  They just want it bad.  And Xbox 360 still hasn't worn out its welcome, and it's still a great game, and we're all enjoying that. 
[01:31:30]  I mean, what does PS – what does PS3 do?  I guess that's a Lazlo question, but what does it actually do to make me want to buy it over 360?  You know what I mean?  It does the same thing.  Yeah.  It is better, though, isn't it?  Just a little bit better than the Xbox 360?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm not a console gamer.  I'm a computer gamer.  Excuse me.  Take your consoles and throw them out the window for all I care.  You use the Y button for run.  We may have an answer.  Yes, Dan. 
[01:32:00]  Well, yeah, it came out a year later, so it is a slightly more powerful console, but nobody can get them, so that's unpopular.  But in terms of the power, it's slightly better.  But a lot of the games are on both systems now anyway, so –  Yeah.  I was looking at something.  They said they have to sell – they have to sell like $80 million for it to be a success.  What?  Like some ridiculous amount.  How is that possible?  Because they lost something.  Something happened with the computer chips, you know, whatever.  And something happened, they lost like $300 million or something, and they spent like a zillion dollars to do research for the PS3. 
[01:32:30]  And it's like they have to sell like 80 million consoles for it to mean anything.  Well, plus they lose money on every console they sell.  Because there's some technology that costs as much as the console.  They make all their money off the games.  The games themselves?  Yeah.  Well, they'll be profitable.  I hope not.  They will.  Because I heard what they did to – you heard what they did to 360 one time is like – or Xbox. 
[01:33:00]  When Xbox first came out, it was more powerful than the regular PlayStation.  Yeah.  And they muscled all the – they muscled – I heard they muscled all the software people.  Yeah, to make it exclusive to Xbox.  Not even exclusive, but make it – like don't make the games as good as you can.  That's why Microsoft games and Bungie games were so much better.  Like Halo was a Bungie game.  It was so much better because PlayStation was like, all right, look, if we let you have same titles and all that, you can't make it better. 
[01:33:30]  As good as you can make it.  And since I heard that, it could be an urban legend.  I was like, good, I hope PlayStation flops.  That reminds me of the biggest disappointments when you used to play Pac-Man when you're out or Asteroids.  And then like Activision came out and they offered those games and you'd pop them in at home.  And they were different, right?  And it was the worst version of like Pac-Man.  Like this big dopey Pac-Man and it wouldn't work the same with this stupid controller. 
[01:34:00]  It looked different.  It moved different.  Was that a copyright thing because Atari did the same thing?  No, they just couldn't put that kind of software in a home system.  And, you know, your home television was pieces of crap back then.  Right.  So you didn't get the resolution.  They used to get the big dopey screen.  This slow moving, wah, wah, wah, Pac-Man.  It was horrible.  You were talking about the console.  How come they can't make what you play on?  Why don't they just, how come they just can't just put a joystick on that and then that's what we play with? 
[01:34:30]  Call it PlayStation 4.  PlayStation 4.  Like why can't they just do that in a console?  It's the upgradability of computers that are great.  Like if new games come out that use new technology and you need a new video card, you know, instead of having to go out and buy a new gaming system, you open up your computer, you pull out the old video card, you throw it away.  Or if you need more memory, you go out and you buy more memory and your game runs smoother. 
[01:35:00]  You can just update your own system.  And you do that up until the point where your computer can't take it anymore.  Then you throw that away.  And start over.  And you buy a brand new computer.  And start over.  And start the whole system over again.  You should, you know, Anthony, his system is so ridiculous.  He's got these massive fans and stuff that are cooling down the thing.  He's got a cooling room.  Sounds like a power plant in my house when I kick off my computer.  It's like turbo fans.  Anthony loves his computer.  I love that about, that's one of the things I like about being a dude. 
[01:35:30]  Like the one thing is that we have so many void fillers.  Oh, yeah.  It's like, my birthday was yesterday.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  Thank you.  So I'm 37.  In white years, I'm 90.  I was going to say.  I'm 99.  I'm glad you did it to yourself because I was going right for it.  Oh, man.  It's horrible.  I'm a 99-year-old white man.  It's in the life expectancy for you guys, like 33. 
[01:36:00]  It's like, I really am.  I should have a cane right now.  You're an OG.  I really did live, you know, past where, you know, whatever.  I don't want to die yet, too.  No, no, no.  Just my credit.  Two years ago, I'm like, baby, I'm ready to go out.  You know, I'm standing on the thing with two guns.  Like, come on, kill me, baby.  But it's like I still sit there and, you know, you figure, you know, how you, you know, you're immature.  Grow up. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah.  I'm just sitting there on my little chair playing, you know, fear.  Yeah.  Or, you know, a Rainbow Six.  Exactly.  It's just that you're sitting there.  I was talking about how, you know, I was talking about on stage how guys, one of the good things about guys that people just don't understand is that we just, we have no shame.  We have so much fun that means nothing.  Like, I daydreamed I was a Hall of Fame running back the other day for four hours. 
[01:37:00]  Like, for four hours.  And I wasn't asleep.  It was a daydream.  I was completely up.  And I just was looking in the air.  And I was shaking people.  And I dreamt I was this dude named, remember the dude from Role Warrior, the villain from the Role Warrior?  Humongous or?  The Humongous.  Humongous.  Lord of the Wasteland, Humongous.  I'm so much.  The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller.  And so, I'm thinking I'm this dude named Humongous, right?  Playing football. 
[01:37:30]  I don't talk.  No one knows.  I don't speak.  Someone found me.  And they just unleashed me on football.  Right, right.  I was just football player named Humongous.  And I'm putting people in the hospital.  And people were, they trying to interview me.  And I don't talk and I wear a mask, just like the Humongous.  And it's just a daydream.  For four hours, man.  And I just woke up out of that daydream, you know, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m.  And I didn't go, what did I do with my life?  I just was like, ah, man.  You're like, hey, that's pretty good.  Man, I wish I could be the Humongous for real. 
[01:38:00]  God, that is something.  Because in my old working days, I used to have to work in the shop sometimes.  When you're not out on a job site, you'd have to work in the shop.  And you'd have to make the stuff that you would install the next day.  Right.  And there were these things called clinch collars.  They're little round things that you cut into the ducts that you then connect pipes onto.  Right.  It's like a little branch line.  So to make these things, they're flat.  And you've got to take them and roll them through a roller to curl them. 
[01:38:30]  And then you stand by a stapler, this huge Bosch stapler that we work with, your foot, and all day staple these round tubes together.  Your mind does not have to be there.  It doesn't even have to be there.  You know, it's purely a part of your brain that is like breathing or a heartbeat or something.  And there's no way to staple your hand.  There's no way to do nothing wrong with you.  No, you really have to work at it to screw yourself up because the space that the metal goes in is very thin. 
[01:39:00]  And the thing loads up with like a day's worth of staples.  You don't even have to change staples.  And you've got a pile of this crap next to you and you know what your entire day is going to be.  So I would stand there and just do exactly what you would do.  I would daydream and mine was that some alien race came down to Earth and gave me all this really cool alien technology because there was this war going on.  But they couldn't – and these other aliens were going to take over the Earth. 
[01:39:30]  Right.  But these other aliens couldn't get involved with the aliens that were going to take over the Earth because they didn't want to war with them.  Like Russians.  They gave us all this –  It was a Cold War.  Right.  Cold War.  Yeah, right.  Okay.  Exactly.  So they gave me all this good like space crap.  Like the Koreans.  And I got my buddies and we would like go up in our spaceships and, you know, kick some alien ass.  And there I am.  Cha-cook, cha-cook, stapling. 
[01:40:00]  Stapling, but I'm saving the Earth at the same time.  I'm in my spaceship.  Anthony Rogers in the 21st and a half century.  Click, click, click, stapling away metal.  You know, you got to do what you got to do to get through the day, bro.  And I think a girl would shoot us over the head.  If she really knew what was going on in our heads.  If she had to do that.  Like everything that they do is based on like actually having something tangible to do. 
[01:40:30]  Dude, eight hours.  I read four hours.  I was humongous.  The non-talking football player.  It's great.  That the NFL had to figure out what to do with me because everyone would get hurt.  Right.  Right.  So they got to change the rules because you're that damn good.  I was not only good.  Like anytime I hit you.  Yeah.  A stretcher had to come out.  The helmet and the shoes would fly off.  And they announced, ladies and gentlemen, you humongous, it's another one.  Like just flashes going off in the stands. 
[01:41:00]  And then one game I was playing a team and I was the captain.  I would just go out.  And they had a bunch of guys and this guy was psyching himself up.  Really like, yeah, you think we're scared of you, humongous?  And he slapped me in the face and spit on me.  And I looked back at the team and his team was like, oh my God.  And my team was like, oh, we're going to do that.  Damn.  I messed up.  Oh, you didn't.  Thank God you're on our side.  Not humongous.  Oh, you didn't slap me.  Oh, no, you didn't. 
[01:41:30]  Hey, Bert from Philly on the instant feedback.  Anthony and Space Hitler building the Fourth Reich.  And you had so much time that you'd have to get every detail in your head right.  Like every, the smallest detail had to actually have some type of realism to it.  No matter how weird these fantasies were.  This was back probably 10, 12, 13 years ago.  And you remember exactly what it was. 
[01:42:00]  Oh, it had to be all the details.  Like everybody couldn't be on to it.  That's Buck Rock.  Yeah.  Like Aunt Rogers, baby.  Like I had to keep all this secret.  You know, I couldn't tell everybody.  You know, so everything was in my.  You said you had.  Yeah.  You said you had.  Just my closest buddies.  It was you and like.  And my close buddies.  About three dudes.  Yeah, five, eight.  You know, just people I knew.  Like buddies that I could trust.  And that's all you needed for the mission.  But everyone else, you know, it had to be a secret.  So I'd have to go about my daily business. 
[01:42:30]  But, you know, when, when the crap would hit the fan, we'd have to hit some secret tunnels and get to the ships and, you know, launch and kick some ass.  And you play this out in your mind.  Oh, yeah.  All afternoon long.  He had to because this is a 10-year-old daydream.  This would go for hours and hours on end in my head as I just chikung, chikung, staple.  Chikung, chikung.  And I'd be annoyed, like, when lunchtime would come around and I'd have to stop stapling and talk to people because I'm like, dude, I'm kicking aliens. 
[01:43:00]  Wait a minute.  What did the aliens look like?  You already, you know what they look like.  What did they look like?  They looked like your typical kind of hack aliens.  They were like your typical.  The long, big head, big eye dudes.  They call them the grays, you know, with the big eyes and stuff.  The close encounters face.  Yeah, that kind of stuff.  And they had some kick-ass, you know, equipment.  And they would, like, hide, you know, on the other side of the moon and stuff like that.  And, you know, I got to go zip out and kick-ass and come back in time for dinner.  Wait, who were you in your daydream? 
[01:43:30]  Did you become better than you were?  I was a tin knocker.  No.  You didn't upgrade from tin knocker.  I still had to go to work.  I had to keep my cover.  It looks like you had, like, a Superman thing going on.  Yeah, I had to keep my cover.  You were kind of like a Clark Kent tin knocker type dude.  Not only was there a spaceship.  But if you expose the aliens.  Yeah.  I mean, if you expose, why didn't you expose us to planet Earth?  That would destroy our whole way of life.  And how did you build this?  Where did you get the materials for the laser beams and everything else?  The aliens, the Cold War aliens that were against the aliens that were attacking Earth, 
[01:44:00]  they gave me all this stuff.  They built all these underground bases.  I'd have to.  See, eat the details.  Oh, yeah.  They built underground bases that were, like, deep below the Earth and take elevators.  Wait a minute.  So when you was thinking, right, so when you're doing the stapling, right, you're, like, in your head rationalizing how to make this logical.  Like, okay, where would I? 
[01:44:30]  So you were saying, so where would I hide the ship?  Yeah.  It goes, ah, underground.  Underground.  But they built the underground thing for us.  Oh, they did everything for us.  They're the coolest guys, those aliens.  And they built everything.  And they told you we can't get involved.  Yeah, we can't get involved.  Why couldn't they get involved again?  Because then it would make war between the two, you know, and they didn't want that.  It was like, it was Cold War.  It was Cold War.  That's what we did with the Russians for a long time.  Yeah, Korea, Vietnam, all that kind of stuff.  Is that what it was based on, that ideology? 
[01:45:00]  I guess so, yeah, in a way.  It was based more on, it was based more on, I was a tin knocker.  Jesus, I'm just a humongous, hitting people in football.  You try to save the universe.  It was based more on, I was a tin knocker with absolutely no future who wanted to be a guy that saved the world.  Ant Vader.  That's right.  That's amazing.  Oh, man.  Hey, we're going to get back to the internet.  I haven't thought of that in years, though.  That's very funny.  You bring up humongous. 
[01:45:30]  Anthony, I want to start the show by talking about Sex and the City.  You know, why do you watch it?  Why do you subject yourself to that?  No, no, no, no, no.  Ben and Rick like Sex and the City.  You watch it, though?  No, this is the first episode of the new season, because they've been ranting and raving.  See, I didn't even know that.  I couldn't even have told you it was the first episode of the new season.  No, no, no.  This is the first episode I've seen of the new season.  It's been on about four or five weeks already.  All right.  So there was nothing else going on last night with, you know, all the thunderstorms and stuff. 
[01:46:00]  So I'm like, all right.  More excuses?  No, no.  No.  I'm kidding.  I don't care.  I'm not as paranoid as you.  I can check out a show even if it sucks or I don't like it.  You catch Queer as Folk?  No, that one I don't check out.  I did check out Six Feet Under, though, right after Sex and the City, because they had some porn star in a bathtub getting electrocuted.  That's kind of a cool show, too.  But after that, then I turned it off because, you know, I saw what I needed to see.  Those luscious cans.  Anyway, Sex and the City last night. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  How do we get this on the radio?  I'm sure there's other guys out there completely horrified by Sex and the City last night.  And the girls were sitting around talking about balloon knot munching.  Right.  Balloon knot munching.  Tossing salad.  Tossing salad.  Rimmer.  The rimmer.  Sure.  Why not?  Dude, I was completely horrified and completely just disgusted. 
[01:47:00]  This is when you're going around to the back door.  Right.  The back door.  If we described it good enough, the Dirty Penny.  The Dirty Penny.  Tim, what's going on?  Opie.  Yeah.  That show last night, I couldn't bring myself to watch it.  It's called Tookus Lingus, they called it.  Yeah, they called it Tookus Lingus last night.  Tookus Lingus.  And did you see the part when they were in bed and he kind of like shoved it? 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He kind of brought it up to his face.  He's like, come on now, honey.  Yeah, let me explain this whole damn thing.  Thank you.  Tookus Lingus.  Lingus.  So, who's the redhead?  Miranda?  Miranda, yeah.  Miranda has a new boyfriend.  He doesn't watch the show, but he knows her name.  Dude, I've watched.  Hey, he had to ask and you knew, Rick.  All right.  I know the names, but I don't know who's who.  It's, you know, Carrie or Carrie, right?  And then, uh, who's the over-sexed?  Samantha.  Samantha, yeah.  I couldn't even know.  And then the one that's married, I don't really know her name. 
[01:48:00]  Ah, Charlotte.  Charlotte, that's right.  Okay.  God, I'm a fan!  So, uh, Miranda has this new boyfriend that she met in the park because, uh, she's training  for the marathon.  Uh-huh.  So, they got all sweaty and stuff.  And, of course, you know, they had to go have sex.  Because that's what the show's about.  Four women kind of pass their prime effing.  Effing all the time.  Ugh.  And I find it deeply disturbing.  And this type of thing should not be on my TV. 
[01:48:30]  I know it's going on.  I know, you know, it's happening out there.  But why the hell is it a show?  I don't get, I, I'd just rather see a collection of girls, if I'm going to watch a show, maybe  a little hotter, maybe a little less city miles on them.  You know?  Yeah.  They're all looking like they've had, you know, they're over-sexed, but they've had a  little too much.  Yeah.  Well, that's, that's fine and dandy, but now they're taking it to the extreme.  So, Miranda's back at her place, and the guy's having sex with her and stuff, and she 
[01:49:00]  ends up on her belly.  Okay.  And, uh, all of a sudden she's complaining because she's all sweaty as, as he's kissing  her back and stuff.  Oh, and she's like, don't, don't.  And she's saying like, don't, I'm sweaty.  Yeah, and he said something like, it tastes good, or I don't know, whatever, it tastes good.  And then.  Oh, no.  And then.  They were jogging?  Yeah.  You work up kind of a froth.  Yeah.  Jogging like that.  Yeah.  So, he keeps, he keeps, uh, he's, so he's, he's going further and further, right?  And he gets to the tuchus lingus. 
[01:49:30]  All right.  And, uh, by her reaction, she kind of liked it.  So, she's liking it.  She's a sweaty piggy mess, and this guy is doing that to her.  He's cleaning up the swamp.  Woo!  He's grunting it.  Cleaning the tailpipe.  Why not?  So, then, uh, the girls have to discuss it.  Of course.  Now, oh, now they're going to sit around, what, drinking coffee and talking about it?  Yeah.  And then they have to, you know, discuss whether they should reciprocate, right?  Yes.  Right.  Oh, so then, um, later on in the episode, the guy and Miranda having sex again, all sweaty. 
[01:50:00]  This was horrific, man.  And what did she tell him?  That maybe she should reciprocate her?  No, no, no.  She didn't really know what to do.  She wasn't, she wasn't sure.  Was the guy assuming that she would?  Exactly.  All right.  So, he's on his belly.  It's unspoken.  He's on his belly, and Miranda's like, you want a back rub?  And he goes, yeah.  And so, she starts rubbing his back, and then, like, slowly moving her hands downward. 
[01:50:30]  He's on his belly.  Yeah.  As she's moving her hands down, he decides to raise the tuchus.  Oh, oh, yeah.  Like, when you have a cat that's in heat, and your pet is back, and they go, row!  So, he starts raising the tuchus all, I mean, all the way up.  And now, it's just man, a** on HBO.  They do enough of that with Oz?  Yeah, totally.  And then, he's in a weird position, and she said something like, I don't want to do that!  Oh, she told him no. 
[01:51:00]  And then, he was all embarrassed, and it was just horrific, man.  What a mess!  It was the worst.  Gay Marco.  Hey!  Hey.  Oh, my God.  Queer, I love that show more than Queer as Folk.  What, Sex and the City?  It is so great.  I love it.  I never miss it.  Aren't there dirty, disgusting women on that show?  But you know what?  I can relate to it more than I can relate to Queer as Folk.  Why?  I don't know why.  I just think that Sex and the City is like, I think it's really gay men as women. 
[01:51:30]  Oh, women in drag?  Well, Sarah Jessica Parker.  I can relate to all the characters so much.  I really can.  More than Queer as Folk.  Queer as Folk is so over the top.  But I love Sex and the City, and all my gay friends love it.  Every gay man loves it.  Because you're a slut.  Did you watch last night's episode?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That was so hot.  He's as cute as tiny.  I would have been there in a second.  Of course you would. 
[01:52:00]  Copper, penny and all.  How many times did he do that during the gay parade?  Oh, quite a number of times.  It would have looked like he was eating a Hershey bar out in the middle of the sun.  Oh.  Thanks, Marco.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Let's go to Lisa.  Lisa, what's going on?  Not much.  I just wanted to say that you guys are like, you know, bitching and moaning about this Sex  and the City business.  But it's like our version of Opie and Anthony for girls.  We were just discussing that with the Time reporter that's in our studio right now. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  We were just saying that.  Time doesn't do the urinating thing like penthouse, do they?  They have girls.  You're going to start with that?  First barrier next week.  Yeah.  Lisa, we were telling Joel that about two hours ago.  I don't know.  This is, I guess, a peek into what you girls think about, huh?  Sure, yeah.  No, I mean, because, you know, we're disgusting.  Just that we don't get an opportunity to be publicly disgusting very often.  So did you watch Sex and the City last night?  I didn't see it last night. 
[01:53:00]  The tuchus lingus?  Are you able to relate to something like that?  Uh, I'm not commenting on that.  Which is yes.  Absolutely yes.  So you would do the tuchus lingus?  I didn't say that.  No, I think she's gotten.  Anthony said that.  I think she's gotten, but I don't think she's reciprocated.  Have you reciprocated?  Yes.  Oh, you've given the rusty trombone?  Oh, my God.  I'm a giving woman.  You know what goes on back there?  I'm well aware.  I mean, I think you girls are aware. 
[01:53:30]  Well, there is showering, you know?  Yeah, but there's a difference.  I mean, there's also, ugh.  Woman, you know what you're doing.  It's like walking through a frozen tundra.  You could see for miles.  You know what's going on.  There's no hidden things going on.  A man, it's the rainforest.  Hack your way with a machete and something might come out and bite you.  Well, you know, guys shave these days as well.  Yeah, you ain't shaving.  What are you shaving back there?  Forget about it.  By 5 o'clock, you'd have the Fred Flintstone 5 o'clock shadow going down there. 
[01:54:00]  5 o'clock ring.  Ugh.  All right, Lisa.  Thank you.  Have a nice day, guys.  And what guy is shaving their butt?  Come on.  I don't even think Rick does that.  Mark, what's going on?  Hey, ONA.  Hey, man.  Hey, I was watching it last night with my girlfriend.  And so we were watching.  And I said, hey, how about some, let's try that.  And her response was, like, jumped off the couch and said, no freaking way in hell.  Wait.  Now, did you want to do it to her?  I wanted her to do it to me.  Oh, you wanted her to do it to you? 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, because I dated a Spanish girl.  That should just be avoided at all costs.  I'm sorry.  That should not be an option in the bedroom.  I dated a Spanish girl.  And she just was wild for that.  It was, like, the best feeling you ever had in your life.  So I figured, what the hell?  Get close.  Go around.  You know, stay away from the undercarriage.  You know what I mean?  You've got to explore, my man.  No.  No.  No, I don't have to.  We don't have to.  You're the one looking for it, Pally.  Why not?  We don't have to explore the whole planet. 
[01:55:00]  We know what's there.  I don't care how much Captain Morgan and Coke I have in my system that night.  There's always, like, the instant sobriety light goes on.  Uh-uh.  Steer clear of that area.  You've entered a restricted zone.  Please leave immediately.  Let's go to John.  John, what's going on, man?  Hey, I just wanted to say, I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Going tongue in the old balloon out on a beautiful young lady is absolutely beautiful. 
[01:55:30]  I mean, the first time you do it, it's kind of like sticking your tongue to a nine-volt battery.  You've got to, like, pull your tongue back real quick.  You're like, oh!  But then you get into it, and it's great.  And they love it, too, no matter what they say.  He's with a fem butt.  Nine-volt battery.  I just know what goes on back there.  Ugh.  Ugh.  You can't date skanks.  You don't do it to some $3 whore off the street.  You know, it's got to be a girl you know.  There's plenty of other parts to take care of.  I mean. 
[01:56:00]  You know, if a guy wants to do it to his chick, that's one thing.  Fine.  But the second a girl wants to do that to a guy, all of a sudden it just, it's really, really awful.  You had to see this guy raising his ****.  Did they get a real hairy actor for it?  The shot was from his head down.  Yeah.  So you saw it kind of like raising up.  And then denied.  Ouch.  And he just kept going higher to higher, hoping, hoping for the best. 
[01:56:30]  How do you go, all right, well, I'm denied.  We'll just move on to something else.  No, pack your stuff.  Leave immediately.  Jimmy, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Yeah, me and my girl only have sex in the city.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, man.  And as far as that tongue-a-slingus goes, hey, toes, elbows, and ****, man.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  Toes, elbows, you guys into everything.  Adam, you're next on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  I just started hanging out with this girl, so Friday night was like our third time together. 
[01:57:00]  And she's taking care of me, right?  And, you know, as I'm finishing up, she puts her hand down there.  And, like, what a way to ruin it.  I'm like, whoa, what are you doing?  And she's like, hey, ho, hey, hey, hey, whoa, hey.  She's like, I thought it feels good.  I'm like, no, no, no.  I'm like, yo, I'll hook you up.  You know, I'll do the shocker thing if you want it.  The shocker.  Oh, my brother tells the shocker story.  Shocker.  Doing the pink one and the stink.  Yep.  All right.  One in the... 
[01:57:30]  Yeah, that's pretty good.  I don't know if that...  Doing the grass one and...  I know.  I don't know if that made the radio.  All right, Adam, thank you.  Bye.  Shocker.  Shocker.  I can understand maybe a little tickle, but when you're talking...  I want...  No, that's...  That's a restricted zone.  James, what's up?  Restricted zone.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I just wanted to let Anthony know you can't knock it until you have a girl try it to you.  Oh, stop.  Listen to me.  It is the most insane feeling that you could possibly imagine. 
[01:58:00]  Maybe after an acetone bath.  No, I mean, what are you going to do?  How the hell are you going to feel?  I think people are missing my point.  I can almost see guys trying it on the chicks.  No, no.  Yeah, you do that, too.  You do that, too.  Chick on to the...  Ugh.  Yeah.  Think about it.  You do it to a girl, it drives her nuts.  If she's doing it to you, yeah, grant the shower, clean yourself off, whatever makes the other person happy.  But it is the most amazing thing in the world.  I would just be all...  Have such a sensitive spot. 
[01:58:30]  Just let a girl...  You guys are famous.  Any girl would be willing to do this to you.  Try it once.  I'd just be sitting there...  I'd be too preoccupied.  What's back there?  Is there a Buick back there?  I have no idea what's back there.  I consider myself pretty clean.  I try to shower a lot and things like that.  Middle of the summer, I come home.  My underwear some days looks like, like we say, a shoe shine rag, okay?  So I can't even imagine this, man. 
[01:59:00]  I don't know.  I cannot imagine.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, ONA.  How's it going?  Pretty good.  I have to agree with that last color.  It is the best feeling in the world.  You're a gay guy, right?  Yeah.  There you go.  But you know what?  I mean, that...  Hello?  Yeah.  But that guy has one thing that...  That guy, his girl can't do one thing.  I mean, maybe she can.  But my boyfriend's always got like a 5 o'clock shadow going.  It is like...  It is like sandpaper.  And it is just the most amazing feeling in the world. 
[01:59:30]  Tell me more.  Oh, my God.  Just in case there was a doubt on my sexuality, I just...  Nope, nope.  Still straight.  Oh, if you hear this one, you know the shocker is when you have your pinky and your index finger?  Yeah.  And that's the shocker?  Right.  There's something called the spocker, which is you do the Vulcan salute.  Now you have the ring finger and the pinky and your middle finger and the index finger.  The spocker. 
[02:00:00]  It's from Froy.  How do you know that?  My brother tells a great shocker story.  I think you heard it.  Girl woke up with fur all over her body.  Ugh.  It's a great story.  What, she was hairy?  No, no, no, no.  No.  She woke up with fur all over her body.  He needs to tell a story, but he's got a big-ass black dog that sleeps on his bed, so the bed has a lot of fur.  And after they were done, it was just a sloppy mess, and they're rolling around that she had fur all over her. 
[02:00:30]  Like sweat and dog hair?  Nice.  But there's more to it, because he shocked her, and it was funny.  At least then you'd have an excuse when you've got to do that awkward...  No, it's dog hair.  A big, thick, curly dog hair.  He had to do the walk of shame to his bathroom mirror, because he knew he was going to do it.  It's a great story.  The walk of shame?  He calls it the walk of shame. 
[02:01:00]  What, when you're embarrassed about who you're with?  When you know you're going to, you know...  The walk of shame is many things.  You've done the walk of shame, right?  I've done the walk of shame.  Like, you're out all night, and you have sex with a pig.  Right.  And then you have to do the walk of shame, you know, at like 8 in the morning back home.  The walk of shame.  Dark clothes, like you're from the nightclub, you're in your dark clothes, you're like three hours of sleep, you reek of booze.  You're just ashamed of yourself.  You know you just did the wrong thing the night before, and you do the walk of shame home.  Can't look at yourself in the mirror as you're passing by.  It's just bad. 
[02:01:30]  Oh, yeah.  You catch a glimpse of yourself through your periphery, and you're just like, you disgust me.  Your roommates are up, getting ready for work.  They got their suits on, and they got their coffee, and you smell like brew, and you're just a mess, and you don't have a job.  You just did this pig last night.  You're stuck to your underwear.  Yeah.  Isn't that the most painful thing?  You got to take your underwear down.  Ow!  Oh, yeah.  Now I got the sprinkler.  Take me to my happy place, please. 
[02:02:00]  I'm a disgusting mess.  Let me go to Joe.  We're just about done with the tuchus lingus.  Joe, what's up?  Okay, guys.  Listen, I'm not gay, but I did have this one girl who used to do, she used to give me oral treats, as you would call it.  All right.  And I'm the kind of guy who, when I'm getting that, I'm very quiet.  I just kind of grab onto whatever I can.  I'm just like, hey, you know.  Enjoy the ride.  Right.  Well, at one time, she started moving her way towards the back porch, if you know what I mean, and wham, I started getting it. 
[02:02:30]  And I tell you, at the point of O, I sound like a donkey getting hit by a wiffle ball bat.  I was like, you know, you know, you know.  And she has the nerve to ask me.  She has the nerve to ask me if I'm all right.  I'm like, you have your mm and my mm.  Pray to God, man.  All right, man.  The bag and nuts are always supporting you guys.  See you later.  Thank you, Joe.  Well, that's kind of a shocker.  More of this crap on the way.  All right, we'll take a break, right?  All right. 
[02:03:00]  We'll be back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Stay there.  This is Stone Cold Steve Austin.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And that's the bottom line, because Stone Cold said so.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the Madhouse.  We got to calm down, man.  I got to tell you right now.  The worst.  I am the worst.  The worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:03:30]  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  It is the worst.  The fucking worst of Opie and Anthony.  That's the worst idea I've ever heard in my life.  See, now, I like how Ronnie did that.  He's on the show.  He gives us something.  And then he plugs a show he's doing.  And I heard you jumping on Earl, asking him,  Hey, Earl, did you mention the Ron and Fez show?  Did you mention that we're on?  After you spit on the dick, mention what time we're on.  What's the hard time?  What's the hard time?  How hard is that?  You spit on another man's cock, and then you say, 
[02:04:00]  Ron and Fez, coming up at noon.  Coming up next.  And maybe there'll be some mouth-to-ass action.  We don't know.  Hey, have you seen the video, by the way?  There's something else I want to bring up.  So, Master Poe choking out Eastside Dave.  Did Master Poe understand that Eastside Dave wasn't truly a threat yesterday?  He's jealous.  Who's jealous?  He's had very little to do since you guys took him up.  Master Poe took down Eastside Dave in a way.  I want to tell Master Poe, maybe we can today, 
[02:04:30]  Eastside Dave wasn't that much of a threat,  that you need to throw the L.A. chokehold on him.  He wasn't doing anything to Earl that Earl wasn't asking for.  But you have to remember, with you guys gone,  he had three months of guarding nothing.  Right.  He really needs some action.  Yeah, he was guarding air.  Hey, Poe, look at this.  We're looking at it again here.  You taking down Eastside Dave.  You're taking it a little too seriously.  Eastside Dave is one of our guys in the end.  Absolutely.  I understand he's one of our guys.  He's part of the team. 
[02:05:00]  But it looked like you were hurting him.  Well, at the time, you really can't, you know,  determine that in a fraction of a second.  If he's going towards Earl and Earl is uncomfortable.  You're serious?  He's uncomfortable.  You're serious?  You really thought Eastside Dave was going to do something really bad to Earl?  Well, actually, I was looking at Earl.  Earl was...  Oh, he was...  There you go. 
[02:05:30]  Wow.  Boy, I didn't miss that.  I like that one.  Poe.  Yes.  All Eastside Dave wanted was a man-on-man kiss.  Right.  That was all he was going to do to Earl.  And Earl kept on saying, I'm very uncomfortable.  I don't like this.  Well, he has to say that to see your face.  Hey, Ronnie, would you mind if we bring Eastside Dave in here?  Of course, you'll get many, many plugs for him being on our show. 
[02:06:00]  I don't mind him coming in, but I don't want another hate crime.  No, no.  The thing that I did with him yesterday, it's got us all upset.  That was kind of a hate crime.  It's got us all upset.  Here comes Eastside Dave.  I've got to agree with that.  It was a hate crime.  Hi, Dave.  How are you doing?  I'm all right.  My voice is a little scratchy.  Oh, from your throat being...  Trouble breathing, Dave?  Yeah, say hi to Ronnie B.  He's on the phone, obviously.  Hey, Mr. B, remember, Ron Fez, 202, noon to 3.  Right away.  Wow.  Right after the show. 
[02:06:30]  Hey, Eastside, I want you to be honest.  I don't even know if you're honest ever.  I have no idea.  I don't know.  I still don't have to figure it out.  But for real, he was hurting you, right?  Yeah, I mean, as you can see, there's bad bruises on my arm here.  Wow, you are bruised up.  I thought that was just another tattoo.  That's a bruise.  A tattoo of a bruise would be funny.  That'd be great if you just got a tattoo of a bruise.  I've never seen so much color in a bruise before.  That's pretty impressive.  He hurt my arms, and then he choked me out. 
[02:07:00]  He hurt my throat.  You could tell my voice is scratchy.  This isn't the full baritone of Dave.  And what about the neck twist?  That was scary.  Yeah, it hurt.  It hurt.  And I think it's, in a weird way, he's sort of intimidated by me because I am bigger than  him.  And I think I could probably, like, if we were facing off, you know, eye to eye, I think  I'm just as strong as Master Poe.  Okay.  And I think that's where it comes from, the uncomfortability.  Because if you notice on those videotapes, he always attacks me from behind. 
[02:07:30]  Ah, that's true.  If it was face to face, you'd definitely take him.  Do you know any of the martial arts like Poe does?  No.  No, you don't need them?  But I played Street Fighter 2 on Nintendo.  All right.  That's cool.  What's so funny about that?  I mean...  You've kicked ass on Street Fighter 2.  Yeah.  And, yeah, Blanka was my favorite.  So you got some of those moves down.  But what was Blanka's, like, weapon?  You want to see some of the moves?  Yeah, let's see some moves.  Let's just see one of your moves from, uh...  He's getting up and up. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, yeah, he is doing that move.  Okay, I see that.  Wow, he spins his hand around.  That looks just like the video character.  You remember?  Yes.  And then he kicks.  That was Blanka's move.  That was Blanka's move.  He would spin it around, and his arm would light on fire.  Well, that didn't happen.  I can't make my arm spontaneously combust, but...  We can.  You got some gasoline?  You want to try the Blanka move on Master Poe real fast?  Do you think that Poe overcompensated for his fear by attacking you harsher from the back?  I think that's exactly what I'm saying, Jim.  Ronnie B, the...  He never faces off at me mano-a-mano. 
[02:08:30]  It's always from behind.  Due to probably overt cowardice.  Yes, exactly.  He's checking shit.  Would you like to maybe, right there on the Ron and Fez rug that is here in the studio,  maybe square off face-to-face?  I don't think this is our call.  Ronnie B, the host of Unmasked, would you allow this to happen on the O.B. and Anthony show?  You know, I'm all for it, but I just want to remind people, the fun doesn't stop here.  It picks up again at noon to five.  Of course.  By the way, I'm so glad XM spent well over a million dollars on a brand new studio and 
[02:09:00]  we still have the exact same phone problem.  Exactly.  Yeah, the phones sound like Ronnie's on Jupiter.  Pew, pew.  It's like listening to Whale's fuck.  Right.  All right.  Let's see this move.  Oppo's taking his shoes off.  Oppo's taking off his shoes.  Apparently he borrowed Patty's feet.  And what's the move again for everybody out there?  Stab him with his toenails.  Set up the move again.  Mr. H, I call this the lightning arm.  Lightning arm.  Yeah, I nicknamed it pretty literally.  I don't like the Mr. H. 
[02:09:30]  Mr. O.P.?  What do you want to know?  I don't like the Mr. H.  Okay, O.P.  Because I really like when you call Ronnie B Mr. B.  I like that.  I give all the hosts that respect.  I've always called him Mr. C.  Mr. C calls me.  I've only heard Mr. B.  I call him Mr. Kumia a lot of times.  Yeah, that too.  I thought that he was happy days.  Yeah, obviously.  Poe is stretching a little bit.  All right.  Well, Dave is standing.  I don't think that's going to be for very long, but he's standing.  Dave doesn't fuck around.  Wouldn't this be better with their pants off?  Yeah, Dave's taking his shirt off. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, Dave, take your pants off, too.  That might distract him.  You never know.  Dave's shirt's off.  Take his what?  I always like to pretend that German guy in Razor Lost Ark, who for some reason had to  take his shirt off before he starts fighting Indiana Jones.  I guess I'm the only one who saw that.  Oh, no, the other guy.  We were just waiting for you to finish the reference, you ass.  The guy that got chopped up in the airplane propeller.  A little nervous or something?  You're not this nervous on Ron and Fez, usually.  His high-top shoes.  He looked a little bigger than you, though, that German guy.  Yeah, just a bit.  He's got high-top sneakers that he's got to unlace. 
[02:10:30]  It's taking him forever to get his pants off.  This must have been what the honeymoon was like.  And there he goes.  Casey was practicing kicks in the corner.  Hey, we got Johnny Fairplay's girlfriend on the line, too, Ronnie B.  Oh, wow.  She's lovely.  Should we go to her real quick?  Johnny Fairplay.  Well, this is going to take five seconds.  All right, the move again for everybody out there.  And from what video game and what character?  I am Blanka.  Well, why can't I hear that, Mike? 
[02:11:00]  Seven and eight right there.  Seven and eight?  What the fuck, seven and eight?  Language.  I don't even know.  Oh, okay.  Gotcha.  All right, go ahead.  Video game character.  I am Blanka from Street Fighter 2, and this is the lightning arm.  All right.  All right.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  We're it off.  Ron and Fez, noon to three.  Run!  Oh!  Well...  Oh.  He's down, and his balls are hanging out of his shorts.  His red bag.  He's down. 
[02:11:30]  I'm still fighting them!  He's still fighting them?  I thought you were tapping out.  What the hell was that?  That was like a prison rape.  That was exactly like a prison rape.  He is laying on the floor now.  His red bag was sticking out of his shorts.  Ronnie, you might be part of a sexual harassment suit in the very near future.  Oh, he's going back at him.  All right, he's going back at him.  Poe's got him in some kind of a hole where he gets his neck. 
[02:12:00]  Oh, wait, wait, wait!  That dude's screaming.  He's on the floor.  That one might hurt.  Yeah.  Fucking tap it.  Oh, he tapped out.  Oh, he tapped out, Master Poe.  He is so red.  He just gets, like, apple red.  Look at the back of his neck.  It's awful.  It's not human.  That's a Martian color.  You're a Martian.  Looks like you had a nice ripe tomato in your pants.  That little red bag popped out.  Maybe your underpants were pulled up too high.  Maybe that's...  Yeah, that was good.  Jesus.  Poe beat your ass off. 
[02:12:30]  You have no ass.  Oh, he's going for the...  Oh, oh, oh.  He tried to...  Ronnie, he tried to jump up on one of the chairs and come up.  Oh, he's got...  Come down on him from a chair.  Oh, that didn't work out too well.  Oh, he's tapping out.  He's tapping out.  All right, tapped out.  He tried to sneak around and jump up on the chair and then attack Master Poe.  He is...  Play by play, boys.  You're really painting a picture for him.  I'm trying, Ronnie.  I'm trying.  It happened so quickly that there's no describing it.  Dave goes to attack Master Poe. 
[02:13:00]  Poe puts him in some kind of wacky hold and Dave is just disabled.  He cannot move.  He can barely tap out to save himself.  His ball bag is hanging out of his shorts.  Like a ripe, fresh garden tomato.  If I didn't know it, it would look like a female halfway through a miscarriage.  That red bag just hanging down his thigh.  It looks like he's miscarrying, but the phone rang.  Is that a...  What happened?  Is that it, gentlemen?  Dave, you all right?  Yeah.  I'm a little... 
[02:13:30]  I thought E-Rock was Master Poe for a second.  I saw that.  Oh, yeah.  You were going to go after E-Rock.  Master Poe's just sitting in the chair, not even out of breath.  He's just sitting there.  Can we make this a weapons match?  At least weapons from my side?  What kind of weapons?  Poe just got excited.  Yeah, what kind of weapon do you want?  Oh, he's...  All right.  What were you going to do with a water bottle?  He's in a chokehold.  Dave's in a chokehold.  Dave's in a chokehold.  He's tapped.  He tapped.  He tapped.  Wow, he was ready to go.  He attempted to use a water bottle as a weapon. 
[02:14:00]  I don't know what you could do with a water bottle.  When I was thinking weapons, I was thinking maybe, I don't know, a sword or something.  I saw 15 things he could have used on this console.  There was a pen.  A mic cord.  That would have been nice.  Foam rubber would have been more effective.  How about he picks up the lounge chair and throws it at Master Poe?  Anything but a bottle of water.  Yeah.  Hey, a bottle of water worked for Dorothy.  Don't forget that.  That's true.  Why'd you pick up a bottle of water there?  You could have chosen any weapon in the studio here.  You look sharp to me.  Yeah, he's a little...  I'm not seeing clearly. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, you're not seeing very clearly.  You're very winded.  You're very winded.  What kind of gay sex act will you be doing today with Earl?  I hope not to be engaging in any...  Now, didn't Earl say yesterday that given the choice, if Earl's mother was going to be raped  and killed by Nazis, that he, given the choice of getting his ass eaten or eating ass, with you, of course, involved, he would eat your ass. 
[02:15:00]  Yeah.  He said it twice.  Yeah, he'd rather eat my ass and have his mom get raped.  Yeah, Ronnie gave him the choice.  And then after he said, I'd eat ass, Ronnie said, well, wait a minute, maybe you're confused.  And he gave him another chance.  And Earl again said he would eat Dave's ass.  Given the choice of having his ass eaten or eating ass.  He must really love ass.  Earl is turning so gay right before our eyes. 
[02:15:30]  He's just popping out of that closet.  He's very kinky.  Yeah.  You know, and...  What you want, up that ass.  Ed, it's always one of his dreams.  Oh.  Oh.  All right.  He's attacking Poe in the chair.  Oh, he's got Poe.  Wow, he's got Poe in the face.  Poe's got him in scissors, though.  Poe has now got him in the scissors.  I like this fight going on.  He's rubbing his sock in Poe's face.  He's trying to get his sock in Poe's face.  He has his sock on his hand.  Poe has now got his foot around Dave, the front of Dave's throat.  No.  And has his arm in a submission hold. 
[02:16:00]  Fight, David.  Oh, he's got his arm in some kind of break hold, and he's got Dave's sock pushed in Dave's  face now.  Dave's on the floor.  He's using his socks as weapons.  I can't, I can't.  Break it away.  Break it away.  Break it, break it, break it.  Oh.  Poe is sitting in the chair.  He's breaking his arm.  Poe is sitting in the chair.  I think Dave's arm might be broken.  Break it.  Break it.  Break it.  Break it.  Break it.  What?  Stop yelling at your favorite movie.  Break it.  Electric boogaloo.  Poe just fallen with his feet.  2-0-2, noon to three today.  Yeah.  Poe actually sat back. 
[02:16:30]  Pretty much hands behind his head in that relaxed, I'm in an easy chair pose, and fought  him with his feet.  Just fought him with his feet.  And Dave was using everything.  His cock, his balls, his socks.  Perhaps more than that, Ant.  He's very adroit.  All right.  He's very adroit.  Yes.  Very adroit.  You're hysterical, Dave.  Dave, was it breaking or electric boogaloo?  What was under your mind?  He can't hear you.  His knee is bleeding.  Your knee is bleeding.  I'm a little bagged up right now. 
[02:17:00]  I think you kind of enjoy this.  I mean, I enjoy competitiveness.  Yeah.  You know, I enjoy sports.  Competitiveness.  Sports.  No, I mean, I've always...  Getting the shit beat out of you is not a sport, sir.  I've always enjoyed the athletic field.  I've always enjoyed the fucking soccer pillar.  Oh, he's going out with his sock again.  Oh, boy.  He's slapping the sock.  Poe now gets him in that headlock and gets his elbow around his neck.  It's a pretty even fight right now.  I don't think I have to tell you the screaming you hear is not Master Poe. 
[02:17:30]  No.  Poe's beating him up in a suit.  Yeah, and it's not even getting musked.  You know how embarrassing it is to be beaten up by a man in a suit?  Dave, you all right?  I think that's probably it right there.  Yeah, you've had enough.  They're bleeding pretty good.  Wow.  Ronnie, your staff is impeccable.  Yeah, they're the best.  They absolutely are.  I don't know how you get them, but God bless you.  We don't ignore them.  That's our thing. 
[02:18:00]  Well, that's true.  See, when we get our guys, they come in.  I don't even know their names for months.  No.  And you know these guys, and they become, I don't know what,  but they become part of the show.  Any final words, Dave?  Yeah.  Yeah.  To Master Poe.  Yeah.  What time is it?  Kick an ass.  Oh, no.  He went in for a couple of body blows.  Oh, wow.  Oh, no.  His fingers are up Dave's nostrils.  And Poe is pulling his nose back.  Dave threw the watch in the air to distract Poe, 
[02:18:30]  and then ran at him.  Because it was time for an ass kicking.  And then Poe threw Dave to the floor,  put him on his stomach,  and dug his Poe fingers up Dave's nose.  And pulled his nostrils back like the shark in Jaws  that got his mouth opened up.  Now Dave is on his stomach with Poe sitting on his back,  and Poe just wiped his boogery fingers off on the back of Dave's thigh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Noon to three.  Noon to three.  Noon to three.  Ron and the Fez show.  XM 202.  Paul, I'll give you five bucks if you lick your fingers.  I'll give you five bucks if you lick your own fingers right now. 
[02:19:00]  Gentlemen.  You get five dollars.  I'll take that five if I lick his fingers.  Yeah, five dollars if you lick his fingers.  No, you're not licking my fingers.  Stay down.  Oh, he just kicked him down on the floor.  I'll give you ten, Dave.  I'll split it.  I'll split with you.  All right.  East side Dave's back up.  Dave does not.  Poe does not want Dave licking his fingers.  Why not?  He's been offered ten bucks.  I'm not licking my fingers.  All right.  Poe is not the kind of guy that likes another man to lick his fingers.  Dave is trying to lick his fingers.  Oh, wow.  Dave's on the ground.  Poe is just down. 
[02:19:30]  Dave's got his tongue out.  He's elbowing him in the eyeball.  Oh, my God.  Poe had Dave on his stomach.  And Poe is holding Dave's head up with his, like, by the eye on his left eye.  He's got his thumb in this socket that's under every human's ear.  I'm dying.  I'm dying.  He tapped.  He said, I'm dying.  I'm dying.  I'm fucking dying.  And then Poe.  This is like that fucking Phoenix airport arrest.  Poe had him on his stomach.  He was holding Dave's head up by his eye. 
[02:20:00]  And then he was slowly putting his elbow on Dave's cheekbone like he could have broken  his cheek.  All right.  Why don't we let Eastside Dave go?  Poe could kill someone so quickly.  I know.  Just literally kill them.  Dave would die with wet fingers in his mouth.  Oh, Dave just blew his nose in his sock.  I got nothing.  Is that my socks?  Yes.  That's your socks.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you blew your nose.  Oh, they're taking it outside.  Are you kidding me?  I mean, he threw the booger sock.  Oh, my God.  He's choking him. 
[02:20:30]  He's got his hand around his windpipe.  Oh, my God.  An arm lock.  He's in an arm lock.  He's not letting go.  Relax, relax.  He put him in an arm lock where he could have broken his wrist.  He might have.  He blew his nose in a sock tomorrow.  You're going to buy me?  No, today.  You're going downstairs to get me socks.  He blew his nose in a sock. 
[02:21:00]  He blew his fucking nose in a sock.  He blew his nose in a sock.  He blew his nose in a sock.  He blew his nose in a sock.  He blew it, Poe.  What a set of balls.  I want black socks.  No, literally.  Figuratively.  I'll get.  I'll buy you black socks.  Two.  A pair.  No to three.  No to three, Ronnie.  No to three.  Nice plug.  Yeah, that's a good one right there.  He's plugging as he's getting his arm broken.  That's a good one right there, Ronnie.  He blew his nose in a sock.  But the best part was.  There was a big cume right there.  That's a good plug.  He threw the fucking sock at Poe and then tried to run out the door, but daintily because 
[02:21:30]  he's barefooted.  It was the worst attempt at running out a door you've ever seen.  Poe grabbed him with his fingers and his thumb around his windpipe and did that squeeze  choke thing where he couldn't talk until he went to the arm break thing.  Then he let go of his throat, and that's when you heard the horrible screaming.  High-pitched screaming and hollering.  All right.  Poe just keeps going.  You can use those socks again, Poe.  He blew it on the outside.  Yeah, just wash them.  Wash them out. 
[02:22:00]  He blew his nose.  What's up?  In his sock.  In Poe's sock.  What's up, Poe?  What an ass.  No, I just have to get my stuff.  All right.  He's getting...  Hey, it's Eastside Dave here.  You're listening to me and my shittiness on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  My brain is...  I am drunk a lot, so I don't remember things.  Okay, I got to fix my brain.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I was home yesterday afternoon, and Young Hawk called me.  Young Hawk? 
[02:22:30]  That's never a treat.  Better known as E-Rock.  When Eric calls, it's the same feeling you get when the doctor you've had your brain tumor  tested with calls.  It's never going to be fun.  E-Rock called me, too, yesterday.  Well, Eric says to me...  I got no call from Eric.  You know better.  Thank goodness.  I pick up.  I'm like, what do you want?  That's how you talked to Eric.  And he goes...  Hold on.  I will challenge you right now.  All right.  He obviously said something that was not interesting to you, right?  Absolutely.  I have to... 
[02:23:00]  I'll face that challenge.  He says to me...  Well, because he said something to me, too, and I think mine is even more who cares than  yours.  What's yours?  You tell me first.  No, because you started this.  Is it about a person?  Oh, is it about...  He's talking behind my back?  He did not...  You told him the same story?  Wait.  No, which means yes.  Is this him coming out of the closet?  Is it...  The gay thing.  We all knew that.  No.  Oh, no, no, no, no.  He told me another Howard Stern story.  Yeah, E-Rock is all connected. 
[02:23:30]  E-Rock's been in the business...  E-Rock's in the business.  ...for 42 years.  He's connected, and he's only 19.  He's got the inside scoop on a bunch of things.  Eric has either been doing radio since he was one, or he's 58.  So I'm like...  He's got more radio stories than anyone in this room.  But I like...  Fair is fair, though.  I think...  When did he start radio?  Like, 14?  16.  16.  He got a very early start.  Mark Pereno's show.  And for West Palm Beach, because his whole family listens, the kid has a lot of potential. 
[02:24:00]  Trust me, man.  Yes.  He just needs to figure out when to sleep.  That young...  Because he calls with dumb stuff.  Because instead of telling me that story you told me yesterday, that could have been another  10 minutes you could have slept.  Because I was like, oh, wow.  All right.  I'll do something with that info.  Thanks.  Click.  So my phone rings.  This is not as good as Howard's turn.  My phone rings.  I pick up.  And he gets Eric.  I'm like, this is going to be a problem.  Watch it.  He goes, hey, I don't know if you're doing anything, but over at XM Jazz, Paris Hilton's  being interviewed. 
[02:24:30]  Oh.  Do you want to probably go down there and see if we can meet her?  Does she have big feet?  Well, you raise a good point.  All right.  So I got in a cab, and five minutes later, I was at XM Jazz, and thank you, XM.  Handled wonderfully by all the lovely people.  We were...  Our name was on the list, and we get up into XM Jazz, and five minutes later, there's Paris  Hilton, and taking a photograph with Jim Norton, and then taking a photograph with... 
[02:25:00]  You got a picture with Paris Hilton last night?  Yesterday afternoon.  Where is it?  Two-third in the afternoon.  All right.  Did you get a camera with you?  No, I was on...  Eric has a 7.2 mega.  That's what we say.  7.2.  Yeah, I have five, which is child's play.  I get the nines.  What?  I get the nines that are out there.  Are you a size queen with megapixels?  Yeah, size queen.  I like a nice fat nine.  Oh, by the way, when he told me Paris Hilton's going to be there, this is what a faggot I am.  I go, do I have time to take a shower?  Oh, God.  Dude, what is wrong with you? 
[02:25:30]  I not only said that, but before I left, I actually had...  I didn't have my chain on, so I put my chain on, and I put cologne on.  Oh!  I put cologne on for my Paris Hilton picture like a douche.  She is a true professional.  I'm looking at the Jim Norton Paris Hilton picture, and even in the picture with Jim Norton,  she gives the I want to F you face.  She's sexy, man.  Wow.  Look at my hair.  I'm a disaster in that photo.  Let me see.  You just took that beating like a man. 
[02:26:00]  Oh, yeah, look at that.  Even with the picture with Jim Norton, she gives the I want to F you face.  Dude, look at that.  She takes a very good picture.  She's amazing.  Look at my hair, dude.  That looks nice.  She's not like...  If that's all you had to do, you would take a good picture, too, Anthony.  That's her whole job in life.  But she's not all slutted out.  I've seen her all slutted out, and she takes a picture where it looks really bad.  Her whole job is to look good in photographs.  She almost looks wholesome in that picture.  She was...  Because no one knows what she does.  Like an ivory girl.  What does she do?  Her whole job is to just look good in photographs.  She's just rich.  We know what she does.  Do you see the video? 
[02:26:30]  Yes.  All you need to do.  She's pretty good at that, too.  I'm not used to seeing her without that greenish tinge to the video.  I didn't know her mouth actually closed.  Her eyes looking like a raccoon in the road at night.  She was pleasant.  I mean, it was just a quick hello.  I mean, um...  Oh, and there's the hawk picture.  Oh, what are you...  Ew!  I didn't see...  You douche!  You are...  Ew!  I didn't see this!  Get this, hold on.  Look at this photo.  Get this on opianthony.com immediately.  You are an ass!  Dude, I took that photo and didn't notice that. 
[02:27:00]  He is leaning into her.  He's leaning into Paris Hilton head to head.  They're touching heads.  And E-Rock is giving his bedroom eyes.  Bedroom eyes.  Ew!  I didn't...  You should be shot!  That's your...  That's your bedroom eyes.  Ew!  Your head is against her hair and her head.  She looks like she's kind of leaning away a little bit and you are bent into her with  your head against her head.  Look at the mouth on her.  Cheek to cheek.  She's...  You can see the mouth is about to go... 
[02:27:30]  She's going...  Die.  Oh, get away.  Die.  It's not the picture.  Smile, smile.  Get off.  We die.  Ew!  Get that picture up.  He's got his bedroom...  It looks like you're going to start crooning to her.  You're lucky I didn't see that while I was taking this.  I would have stopped the photo and bitten your face in the middle of it.  That is atrocious.  She's not happy in the...  How can she?  No.  She's not happy in the E-Rock picture.  She's much happier in the Jim Norton picture.  Get these pics up so everyone can check it out.  I put my arm around her and someone print out my picture with Pauly. 
[02:28:00]  Your picture, E-Rock, is almost bordering on, like, rape.  That's great.  That's a big get, by the way, as far as celebrity photos go.  I could have had Nikki Hilton at the honorized thing, but she was...  I didn't follow her around looking for her.  I didn't care about her.  By the way, is she is...  What about her big bony feet?  Well, Eric, thanks for you, Anthony.  We think about you all the time.  Thank you.  What's up with that?  You got a mic or something?  I got a mic on for something.  Why don't you lean your head into the mic like you did this poor girl's head?  Pretend there's a millionaire girl who likes hogs. 
[02:28:30]  Yes, I made sure to look.  She does have big feet.  Big feet.  And are there a lot of tendons in them going toward the toes?  Does it seem like big tendons on top?  Very skeletal.  Very skeletal.  See?  Is she as hot in person?  She's...  She's...  Except for those talons.  She's really hot, man.  I mean, you can't say she's...  She's sexy.  She's a pretty girl and she takes a good picture.  I'll give her that.  She was kind of done down. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, she's not done all slutty.  Dressed up.  She wasn't dressed up really.  She's got a little white headband thing, a hair thing, like very retro 60s looking.  Kind of nice.  Looks good.  Good picture.  Pleasant.  Walk thing as disturbing as all hell.  Oh, what an ass you are.  Leaning in.  That's a boyfriend-girlfriend.  You're 16 years old in the photo booth picture.  Yes, it is.  That's what that is.  You put your faces next to each other and smile.  That's actually two photos spliced together.  That's the photo booth boyfriend and attack victim put next to him. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  Boy, does she not look...  You can see who's happy about this relationship.  This is like the star 80 photo.  That's probably the last...  Star 80, yeah.  That's the last photo.  The boyfriend's just happy that she's there with him.  He's got a knife in her back.  She's just, please, get this creep away from her.  I hope the answer to this is no, because I don't want to chew up my knuckles punching Eric in the face.  But I will get up and punch him.  Is that your new picture on MySpace?  It has to be.  I got to punch you.  I have to punch you.  Why?  I knew it was going to be. 
[02:30:00]  But it has to be.  That's it.  I just took a wild guess.  You have a MySpace account.  You got a picture with Paris Hilton.  Of course it has to be.  You want to see this awful picture?  MySpace.com slash Jim Norton.  Why, you?  You don't have Eric's picture up.  You son of a bitch.  Now, the pictures will be up on opianthony.com.  You just stole a bunch of people that were going to his site.  Right.  My picture, actually, I'm going to put mine up today.  MySpace hijacker.  You suck.  By the way, you're – by the way, my phone call is – yeah, is way more who cares than yours. 
[02:30:30]  What a dreamy-eyed douche he is.  I can't – because he was like, can I get a picture too?  It's like, hey, Eric, you hooked this up.  Of course you can get a picture.  He's dreamy.  His eyes – his brow is like kind of furrowed in the middle and going down a little like, hey, baby.  It's revolting.  It really is.  This photo, I – the head is so tilted in.  He's trying too hard and it's so obvious in that picture to get close to her. 
[02:31:00]  And I'm sure he was only thinking, new MySpace picture.  Here it is.  I got to get close to it.  If it just looks like a celebrity picture, that's not good enough because everyone has those.  I want people to go to MySpace and think I'm going out with Paris Hilton.  So I have to get in there and make it look different than just anybody taking a celebrity shot.  What's even more creepy is the bedroom eyes.  The bedroom eyes.  And with the left hand, you look like she's sitting on your lap.  It looks like Otto and George.  This is your Paris puppet. 
[02:31:30]  You're the creep.  It really looks like he's controlling her.  We should take a break.  We're running late.  Certainly.  He called me about Howard last night too.  Should I tell that real fast?  Do we have time?  I'm eating dinner and it's E-Rock.  We'll make it fast.  He goes, you're not going to believe this one.  And of course you would.  I'm like, what?  What, E-Rock?  What happened?  Well, remember when my buddy catered some breakfast for the show?  I go, yeah. 
[02:32:00]  He had a catering job for the satellite radio company that Howard works for.  Yeah.  All the salespeople.  I'm like, yeah, so?  He goes, no, man.  So they show up with all the catering, you know, and they're downstairs.  And they weren't allowed to go upstairs because Howard was in the building.  Really?  Okay.  So that's a cool start to the story.  Then what happened?  So E-Rock, explain.  So I told them that apparently they have a policy that if Howard's in the building, anybody who has any kind of delivery is not allowed to deliver it to Sirius. 
[02:32:30]  They have to leave it in the lobby and somebody has to come down and get it.  Really?  And I'm sitting there eating my dinner like, oh, wow, that's kind of interesting.  It's kind of funny, yeah.  Could have waited.  Didn't need a phone call.  I didn't know what to say.  I'm like, wow, all right, thanks.  We'll do an hour on that tomorrow.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Hold on.  I'm still in shock at the potential for films and a script I see for this.  Do you mean if I had something to be delivered to him, I couldn't just walk in it myself and have to leave it downstairs? 
[02:33:00]  Please, I can't.  Paint the picture for the listeners.  Well, we've heard the stories how paranoid he is, so that's not a surprise.  I love the fact that they take his whole limo up in an elevator.  That is the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life.  Yeah, the whole limousine just pulls into a giant elevator and lifts him up.  The service elevator.  So he doesn't have to.  And lifts him and his limo all the way up.  Yeah.  How high up was that again?  We were there.  I don't know.  Forty-some-odd stories.  And then he can step out of the limo and be right there and not have to face any of the fans that defend him. 
[02:33:30]  So, Eric, you're saying if this dreamy-eyed face of you had showed up for a delivery, they wouldn't just allow you to walk right in?  No, they wouldn't, Jim.  What are you delivering?  Baby doll eyes?  I'm delivering a pair of baby doll eyes.  Anybody call for these?  Anybody call for a pair of baby blues?  All right.  We'll take a break.  You take a picture with a catering guy and lean your head in?  I took that picture and didn't catch it.  I can't believe I didn't catch that.  How did you not?  I'd have thrown the camera at his head. 
[02:34:00]  I just wanted to make sure I got, as I call him, I call him son.  I wanted to get son a good picture.  Son.  Bob from Boston.  Great radio.  Let's spend all morning discussing photos that no one can see.  Yeah, because it's only 2006.  You jackass jerk.  Everything is available on what's called the Internet these days.  If there's a picture and we talk about it, it's instantly put up on this thing called the information superhighway.  I think they're calling it these days, you fossilized idiot. 
[02:34:30]  You never heard about it?  Those pictures will be up on opianthony.com.  And trust me, when you see the picture of Eli, you too will laugh at him.  I don't think they're going to Photoshop this on Wackbag or any of the other places with punky men.  Yeah, I don't think they'll Photoshop Eric's face with Hulk Hogan or like Robert Reed or the Chippendale dancers.  Oh, yeah.  Those dreamy eyes.  A big man's chest against Eric's face. 
[02:35:00]  They wouldn't dare do that because that would just embarrass him.  You look like you should have been like Liberace's lover or something in that picture.  Liberace's boy toy.  Oh.  A little young.  All right, we'll continue.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi, this is Sunset Thomas, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's show.  Do it again.  More romantic, more excited, what?  Let's do it.  Sexy?  Hi, this is Sunset Thomas, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony's show. 
[02:35:30]  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony show.  You know what, motherfuckers know less about these two motherfuckers than you ever know.  Like, I know more about myself.  Yes.  Hey, we're not stupid.  Since I've done this radio, like, I'm sitting there going, I was like, wow, I didn't know that about me on this motherfucking show.  I told people I fucked the sink.  These cocksackers won't reveal anything.  Do the impression.  I brought up showering when my father made us all shower at the same time. 
[02:36:00]  That was fucking embarrassing.  What happened?  My father was teaching me and my brother how to shower.  You're afraid to wipe your ass and get some shit on it?  At 27?  He was teaching us when, I don't know, I guess I was about six or something, and my brother was probably seven.  And he thought, you know, bath time was over.  But you're doing George Burns, so he stopped.  No, I wasn't doing George Burns. 
[02:36:30]  That's how it started.  He goes, hey, kid, smoke this cigar.  Try to say goodnight, Gracie.  Say goodnight, Daddy.  Goodnight, Daddy.  And I was petrified because he was standing under the water from the shower, and I was standing, me and my brother were standing on the back, like, wall, where there wasn't water, and the water was running down his body.  And you know how when you shower, the water runs off the head?  It runs right off the head of your cock. 
[02:37:00]  And I kept, he was like, come here, and I'll show you how to shampoo your hair and stuff.  And I'm like, no, you're going pee-pee.  Because it looked like he was taking a leak.  I thought he just made you and your brother take a leak.  He got in with you.  Yeah, he was in the shower.  And to a kid, to a kid, because I'm like, you know, he's my dad.  His cock looked like it was, like, two feet long.  Did he teach you how to sleep together, too?  No.  Daddy, what's that?  It's a finger, and you know where that's going.  No, it was, there was nothing sexual about it. 
[02:37:30]  Don't let him get up.  Wait a minute.  You just said water, you just, water going down your father's body, down his cock, into your mouth.  What's not sexual about that, homo?  It wasn't sexual.  You had a homemade super soaker going right in your eyes.  Was there a lot of woo noises?  No.  Every time you go past a fountain, you get a hard on now.  Did he teach you how to lie to a counselor, too?  One of those little cupids with the water's coming out of the dick. 
[02:38:00]  Come on.  He's like, oh, my God.  Oh, look at Atlas.  Look at Atlas.  He doesn't throw change in it.  He throws his self in it.  It's not sucking.  It's gone.  Oh, look at that statue of Hercules.  It wasn't sexual.  He was teaching his sons how to shower.  Oh, really?  They would say when they taught Ed Norton how to shower in American history.  When he was stunned, did he trade you to the Aryan Brotherhood? 
[02:38:30]  No.  I didn't know that lifting up your left butt cheek was part of shower.  Daddy, is that a hard loofus thing?  Cry it, kid.  No.  It was a father teaching his kids how to shower.  But I didn't want to go near him because the water was running off,  and it looked like he was taking a leak.  What kind of rag is that, Daddy?  It had nothing to do with that. 
[02:39:00]  Hold on.  That motherfucker dressed sexy to get more drugs from a fucking dad.  Oh, look at him sticking up.  Thank you, Will.  I'm trying to defend Andy.  Yeah.  Okay.  Andy, stop.  All right.  Back to the lady.  Hold on.  Wait a minute.  Hold on.  Hold on, son.  Let me smack this soap on your ass.  It wasn't like that.  Let me put it.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  If anybody knows he's a queer, it'd be fucking Vaughn.  Thank you, Jimmy. 
[02:39:30]  It wasn't anything like that.  You've lost Jimmy.  You've lost me and Antoine.  Why are you attacking me?  Let's go.  You brought it up.  You only defended him because of your skeletons.  Fucking bathtub experiences, okay?  Why am I attacking you?  I'm attacking you.  His brother almost drowned trying to give himself a blowjob in the bathtub.  Trying to get the heat off of me, motherfucker.  He's throwing his brother under the bus.  His brother tried to blow himself in the shower? 
[02:40:00]  In the bathtub.  That's the famous story on the show.  And he was underwater.  His face was underwater, and he had a snorkel in his mouth.  No, no, no.  It was his dick, and his mother walked in.  Well, my mom walked in because she was knocking on the door, didn't hear anything, and she was  always paranoid that we were dying.  So, she walks in, and he's under the water blowing himself.  He pops out of the water.  Like a Navy SEAL.  She ran down the hall screaming for my dad going,  Freddy, Brett's gay!  Is that what happened with you, Anthony?  Hold on!  And then Brett ran after her, soaking wet with a hard on, going,  Mom, I'm not gay because I... 
[02:40:30]  I was getting it.  I wasn't giving it.  Something like that, yeah.  I wanted to get one.  I didn't want to give one.  That's what happened with Anthony.  His dad caught him doing it, and he goes,  Son, if you're going to practice, let me show you a real one.  No!  There's nothing wrong with that.  There was nothing like that at all.  It was just this fear that he was urinating,  and I wanted him to finish before he showed me how to shampoo my hair.  Where was he?  You and your brother, you were acting like you had a walk-in shower.  No, it was your basic Long Island tub and shower.  You couldn't be like nine feet away. 
[02:41:00]  I was against the wall.  You were like an inch away.  They were playing Ring Around the Rosie.  And he was standing under the water facing the back wall of the shower,  and we were against the back wall facing him.  So he's just...  And the good thing about the shower,  they can't see the tears coming out of your eyes.  He's killing you.  I know, but because all I have to work with is the truth.  That's all I have.  Motherfucker.  I hate you.  Was it weird when you saw white shower water coming off of Daddy's penis? 
[02:41:30]  Wow.  There wasn't any.  Stop it.  Shower water, there wasn't washed it off.  Suddenly, I don't want to drink this smoothie while I'm telling this story.  Daddy, they didn't even invent liquid soap yet.  It looks like conditioner.  What the hell?  Daddy, did you bring eggs into the shower?  Bobby brings it right to food.  Right to food.  I want Vos to wipe his mustache off.  Did he dip you?  Did he dip you in one foot up with the air? 
[02:42:00]  No, he didn't dip me.  I wouldn't even go near him.  Are you playing any games like Duck Duck Fag?  I just...  Fag, you're it!  And you're always going to be it!  I just tried to...  I stayed away, so it didn't work out.  The whole showering, learning thing didn't work out.  It ended with me crying because I didn't want to go...  Well, because I didn't want to go near him while I thought he was urinating.  Did he paint Duck Ears on it? 
[02:42:30]  No, he didn't.  Oh, shit.  You are the worst.  It has nothing to do with it.  Oh, yes.  Tell that to child services.  I am better off with the George Burns audio.  Did he have a loofah sponge shanging on his cock?  No, he didn't have a loofah.  All right, we've got to talk about this dominatrix out west there.  In where?  I think she's in Arizona somewhere.  I don't know if it's Tucson or Phoenix.  I really don't know where she is in Arizona.  I've never met her. 
[02:43:00]  I've only seen her online and done tremendous damage to myself looking at her video clips.  Online?  She's got a website, yeah.  I can't get the website out, but I'll just say her name.  She's a public figure.  It's Karen Von Croft.  Oh, well, that sounds very...  Oh, she's a naughty one.  I love her.  To me, she seems like, at least from her movies, like she's...  And she paddles, like you said, little one, but that's the way to do it.  That's the way to do it.  No, it's not.  No, it is.  Because you can't just bludgeon somebody. 
[02:43:30]  I won't have any of it, but I'm thinking if somebody is into it,  they should be beaten within an inch of their life by these broads.  You're so right, Ed.  No, she doesn't do...  Oh, yeah, she doesn't do...  I don't like...  It's phony.  I don't like living in the fantasy world.  Yeah, it's a fantasy, phony thing.  Right.  And they should just be beaten where they are found on the floor,  and if they didn't get to the hospital that minute, they would die. 
[02:44:00]  That's a true dominator.  That's a dom.  Not the fuzzy handcuffs like they're velcroed on.  Yeah.  Ooh, scary stuff here.  Oh, I'm trapped.  I'm trapped.  I'm out.  What kind of crap is that?  This girl, I just...  Jimmy's getting frustrated.  We just don't live in that world.  No, I'm not into that either.  Dude, not at all.  Not at all.  We've seen Jimmy.  He's not into the spanking.  No, no, no.  But when I say not live in the world, like, you understand on some level.  I don't understand.  Yeah.  I just don't.  I don't get it.  I don't get that.  There are guys that like that hardcore. 
[02:44:30]  I mean, I've met one hardcore dom in my life.  Like, that was for...  She wouldn't take safe words or any of that stuff.  She was for real.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She was, like, in boxing and stuff.  She would really hurt you.  See?  There you go.  That's the real deal.  If you're into that, go to her.  If she's for real, then she would have a murder rap somewhere.  Yeah, something.  That's for real.  One of her dom clients gone awry.  Right.  Where she just left them dead.  Yeah.  Had to wipe down the doorknob when she was leaving.  The strap-on power drill went awry. 
[02:45:00]  You know, something.  Something happened.  Like, it was a mistake, so she only did...  Oh, God, stop!  Oh, God!  No, you're naughty, remember?  It was a mistake, so she only did five to seven.  You know what I mean?  So she's out there, and it's on her resume.  What's your safe word?  I don't remember.  I've lost too much blood.  Oh, my God, stop.  You're killing me.  I thought this would be just fun.  I turned 40, and I just wanted to try something new.  Oh, God. 
[02:45:30]  I got a wife and three kids at home.  The nude body of a father was found today in a seedy hotel room.  It was?  I made a mistake because my safe word was, I dare you to do it harder, bitch.  It was a safe phrase.  It was a safe word.  Oh, it's just the worst.  It really is.  Fantasy play taken to the umpteenth extent is ridiculous. 
[02:46:00]  And I mean that with dominatrix, your significant other, or wife, or anything like that.  There's fun stuff you do in bed while you're having sex.  You know, like we brought up in the past, the hair pulling's fun, a little smack on the ass,  a little good-natured slap on the ass, things like that, biting, things like that.  It's fun and good-natured.  But if you're following a script, Mr. Faber-Sham, I'm going to have sex with you. 
[02:46:30]  Sex with you.  You know, it's too deep.  Like, all right, I come home from work.  If it entails blocking your house off and a director, and like, I come home from work,  you're waiting in the maid's uniform.  Right.  Stop it.  I'm going to come through the window.  Yeah.  And you're going to blow my head off because you forgot it was Tuesday.  Right.  You know.  It was right, fantasy day.  Fantasy day.  I thought it was Wednesday.  It was Tuesday. 
[02:47:00]  And I shot him.  Now I can't even chew my food anymore.  It's just a business trip to Des Moines.  He was supposed to come home on Wednesday.  It was Tuesday because we had this rape fantasy.  And he came through the window and I shot him.  He shot me.  I should be.  I have no jaw left.  You want to do for a rape fantasy?  Like, have a girl.  Like, there are girls that want you to do that.  Like, you tie them up and, like, you know, it's a blindfolder. 
[02:47:30]  I want to have that with a girl where I say, I'm going to blindfold you and tie you up.  And then while it's happening, call her cell phone and go, it's not me doing it.  Send somebody else.  Hey, I'm going to call her and go, I'm sorry, baby.  I'm not going to be able to get home for about another hour or so.  I sent my black co-worker to pick up a couple of things.  What the hell was that?  Uh-oh.  Oh, okay.  I don't like role-play. 
[02:48:00]  That's where I recognize it.  Role-play is just, like, you know, I'm the mailman.  No, you're not.  Yeah, no, you're not.  You're just the same girl.  You're not.  I'm the naughty nurse.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  With the stupid rubber suit like it's 1941 with the red X on their hat.  Right.  What year is this?  Look.  What, are you going to put leeches on me?  How old is that nurse costume?  Look, I'll admit you look hot as, like, whatever.  I can't say the word.  You look hot, but you're not a nurse, okay?  You're not the naughty nurse.  And the naughty nurse thing is a sicko fantasy for a guy. 
[02:48:30]  It has to do with, um, with, uh, what do they use?  Enemas?  Yeah.  The enema.  Things like that.  Things that are, like, I'm sickly.  I need to be in your care kind of a thing.  It's a motherly thing almost.  It can be, or it could also be a candy striper type thing where they're just hot chicks and,  like, little short skirts.  Well, that's totally, that is completely different.  If there's a girl in a rubber nurse suit with that big red cross on her hat, get away from me. 
[02:49:00]  That's ridiculous.  But a candy striper thing?  That's kind of cool.  You know, that's cool.  But as long as it doesn't go into this extravagant scripted role playing.  Oh, I hate that.  You have been a bad boy.  Yes, I have.  I sure have.  I have.  Naughty nurse.  Oh, no.  What are you going to do? 
[02:49:30]  What are you going to do?  You know, sometimes when I'm kissing, I have to fight the urge to grab the throat.  Do you really?  Oh, yeah.  Just choke a bitch?  I don't want to hurt her, but I like to choke a lot, man.  I have to fight the urge.  Like, if I'm kissing a girl, all of a sudden she'll feel my hands in a necklace pose around.  Whoa.  Just tapping her chest.  Tapping.  Like, I really want to choke you.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you?  Oh, Jesus, Jimmy.  Love this.  Anthony and Yonkers, what's up?  Yeah. 
[02:50:00]  Anthony doesn't like living in the fantasy world.  Too damaged.  Too damaged.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  I keep my fantasies to the computer monitor.  Yeah, LARPing a lot cooler than Dominator.  Is that a train?  Look, I didn't say, like, fantasy or some type of, not role-playing, but just things you  don't do in normal life in the bedroom is fine.  And like I said, you know, a little playful stuff.  I like playful stuff, but also, you know, like a little bit of hair pulling is cool, 
[02:50:30]  things like that, the little smack, but in, like, playful, funny kind of ways.  The real rough stuff or the scripted, like I said, the guy's in the garage and it's already  begun.  And action.  All right.  I'm pulling into the garage.  What's going to meet me at the door?  Oh, it's the naughty maid.  Right.  Oh, is it? 
[02:51:00]  She's got her feather duster.  There you go.  Naughty maid.  Hey, big boy.  In the naughty maid outfit.  Oh, who hasn't seen that?  You want me to clean?  And then she winks?  No.  Stop it.  I'm a fan of the oopsies.  Oopsies?  What is the oopsies?  You know, you...  They bend over and there's an oopsie.  Like, oops, you weren't supposed to see that.  Oh, oh.  Oh, yeah.  And do they turn around and take their hand and slightly cover their mouth and go, oopsie. 
[02:51:30]  Oh, you weren't supposed to see that.  They turn around and look over their shoulder with their hand to their mouth.  Oopsie.  You're not taking a peek, are you?  You bad boy.  Oopsie.  I had a nurse...  I'm a businessman with three kids.  The same word was supposed to be fuzzy.  She's dead. 
[02:52:00]  I saw this girl in Vegas and she would do a nurse...  And her nurse's name was Nurse Pig.  Nurse Pig.  Nurse Pig.  See, that's not sexy.  Oh, dude.  I could never get past the name Nurse Pig.  She ruled.  She'd come out of the bathroom in like a dirty nurse outfit, but she was full service.  And she's what you call a completely good egg.  Really?  Yeah, and we would do all kinds of things and she would spit in my mouth.  She was a really good nurse.  And I'm not a submissive, but she was such a pervert. 
[02:52:30]  I loved her.  She tried to hit me with the strap on.  Wow.  I didn't let her, though.  I just let it go for a second and stopped it.  I couldn't do it.  Wait, wait.  You let her go for a second, though?  No, no.  Let's just say this.  All right.  It was just knocking at the door?  Not even.  Let's just say...  Who's that knocking at the door?  Yeah, but I wasn't going...  The door was never going to be open.  Who's that ringing the bell?  Yeah.  It was more just kind of cool to see someone being such a pervert knocking at the door.  I just kind of love the deviance of the whole thing.  But as far as the door being open, never going to happen. 
[02:53:00]  No.  No, not for any bad reasons other than I just...  It's not my thing.  You didn't let her in, huh?  No, I didn't want to let her in.  It was just...  I corrected your hymn.  It was a her.  Well, you know...  That sensation does nothing for me.  Oh.  All right.  Hey.  Let's just have a fist attached to it.  Look at Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Yeah.  Bye for that.  Hey, what's up, Owen?  Say goodbye to that one.  What's up?  What's up, Joe?  I hate that role-playing crap, man.  My girlfriend was trying to get me into role-playing the other night when I was trying to sleep.  So I told her she should play a paralyzed mime. 
[02:53:30]  Just lay there and shut up.  Why would you try to get you into role-play while you were sleeping?  Five minutes later, I was back asleep.  Lovely.  All right.  Good.  Sounds like a thrill a minute, doesn't it?  Let's role-play.  We'll play board radio hosts, and you'll play a guy with an awful joke.  Go.  Oh, this is going well.  I'm just a business man, baby.  Eric in Colorado.  I didn't know.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, how's Dylan?  How's it going?  Hey, I got to nominate Anthony for line of the day. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah?  Whirly.  Earlier, when you were talking about staying in the end, he brought up Paul McCartney conducting an orchestra,  and he said that Paul McCartney is going to be using a wooden stick made for his wife's leg.  Oh, no.  I wouldn't.  But I'm declining the nomination.  I thought that was kind of hurtful.  It was hurtful.  It was mean, spirited.  That's not what this show's about.  It's about making people feel good and laugh.  No.  It's about fun and laughter.  Let's go to MJ from Long Island before we take a break.  MJ. 
[02:54:30]  Yo, ONA.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I used to do security work for a domination talk here, and she used to tell me what this guy wanted.  He wanted her to strap it on at least 10 plus, give it to a war like a really bad episode of Oz.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  I mean, she used to tell me about it.  I mean, I was like, did the guy want anything?  She's like, no, not even Astroglod.  I'm sitting there hocking up a loogie worse than Jimmy after seeing something real gross.  It was disgusting.  It was disgusting. 
[02:55:00]  Would she make you carry and clean the equipment?  Thank God, no, but it had to go with my vehicle.  Oh, my God.  You got it.  You got it.  You told me, little Jimmy, you suck.  Don't have a change.  Thank you, buddy.  All right.  There you go.  Hey, someone from their cell phone, the worst is when you're done and the uncomfortable silence  as you put away the lube, cuffs, plastic blindfold.  Oh, it's the most awkward.  You throw everything in the dishwasher with the kids' sippy cups.  Oh, that big rubber mouth with the extension on it and the little electric light turner 
[02:55:30]  on or off or that goes on it.  It's sitting in the dishwasher next to your champagne flute.  Right next to the Scooby-Doo sippy cup.  Yeah, because we're going to do a separate load for the sex toys, right?  Right, gals?  Better.  Throw it all in the dishwasher and get the kids ready for school. 
[02:56:00]  That's the most embarrassing thing, though.  It's like the cleanup time.  Always has been.  Yeah.  Just because it's all fine and dandy until everything's laying around the room and the  bedroom and then you're like, oh, it's cleanup time.  Try making small talk when you're folding plastic bags and gargling with peroxide.  Small talk.  But, by the way, I know a Dom who did guys, plushies, and she said there was one guy that  loved it. 
[02:56:30]  One guy she sees, she makes come out to the car, pay for her cab.  He's totally nude.  When he pays for her cab.  Walk out into the street naked.  That's part of the gig?  Part of the gig.  It's the public humiliation.  Ah.  And she'll put him in a rabbit outfit or something.  I should call her and ask her.  Check in at the Overlook Hotel.  Yeah.  Get a room upstairs.  Great party.  Yeah, and then she'll bury an axe in someone's chest.  No, but she's, these guys are real wacko.  She's hardcore, man.  She's really nice.  Wow.  I don't see her in that capacity.  Fast forward to the police station.  You're dressed in a rabbit. 
[02:57:00]  Oh, God.  I didn't know it'd go so far.  The cottontail part cut out.  I'm on a business trip.  And she stole my cell phone and my credit cards.  She fell.  She fell against the headboard.  I, we were, it never meant to happen.  We've done this before, but she fell.  What am I going to tell my wife and four kids? 
[02:57:30]  You sure have thought about that earlier, sir.  Whose costume are you wearing?  Oh, God, I'm in the costume I didn't even think about.  Blood all over the costume where he was cradling her, her head that cracked open on the headboard.  I don't know why.  A bloody bunny costume.  And blood where the tail is, which is what started this whole aggression on his part.  Why he pushed her off and she hit the headboard.  Absolutely.  And something that looks like the missile that launched XM with crimson all over it. 
[02:58:00]  I don't know why this thing makes me laugh so hard.  Because it's such an uncomfortable situation.  He's totally screwed.  Right.  I never cheated on my wife before.  The guys talked me into this at the office.  I'm a family man.  I got a father-son picnic with my son tomorrow at the school.  I can't get stitches.  Oh, my God. 
[02:58:30]  He's at the police station in a bloody way.  Dead Dom in the morgue.  He's screwed.  He has to walk gingerly around the house to hide the shame.  And he only eats applesauce and pudding for two weeks.  Oh, my God.  Every morning, she hears her husband in the bathroom screaming.  Eating his Cheerios in his bowl with one big blow-up Cheerio on his seat. 
[02:59:00]  The wife's just look of contempt on her face for him.  She's just buying her time.  The house is mortgaged now for bail.  Just because he killed the hooker.  I love this story.  He has to gingerly walk all over there.  Oh.  14 dissolvable stitches. 
[02:59:30]  Dissolve.  Take another sitz bath with some Epsom salt.  He's got to sit in a little bin of Epsom salt every night to prevent infection in that germy area.  Now, remember, applesauce and pudding.  We'll try to get you on more solid foods in a couple of weeks.  You don't want to tear the stitches.  I can't have peanuts.  No.  No. 
[03:00:00]  Popcorn.  And then when you think you're going to get bad enough, you have to leave the police station.  You're still in the rabbit outfit.  And then the media is outside.  They take you to another location.  Daddy, I can't even go to school anymore.  You're the laughing stock.  They call you the bunny man.  They call you bunny butt man.  I love it. 
[03:00:30]  Oh, I love if every one of these situations just turns out like this.  Oh.  It's too disturbing.  There was a Dom in Boston who died recently.  And he had a heart attack on the rack.  And this selfish bitch was worried about herself and let him suffer for like five minutes and die.  Oh, my God.  And they chopped up the body.  They didn't kill him.  They just didn't help him.  Yeah.  That's not helping when you let him die and then chop him up. 
[03:01:00]  You got the dead hooker.  You're in the bunny rabbit outfit.  Call your one trusting friend to chop up the hooker with you.  And dispose of the body.  Oh, before the cops get there?  Bobby, you got to help me out, man.  Hey, Mark in Boston.  Yes, I said buying her time.  I'm sorry.  I was excited about her.  I was excited about our scenario.  Yes, I did say that.  Oh, I got tears, man.  I don't know why that makes me laugh. 
[03:01:30]  Oh, it's such a great.  Holy crap.  You're screwed moment.  And it's not you.  It's just great, isn't it?  I don't know why I enjoy that, too.  That's the only fantasizing I want to do as far as Adam is concerned.  She's dead.  The businessman's life is ruined.  His family disgraced.  It's just a business trip that went awry.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:02:00]  It's having a little fun.  You want a naughty nurse fantasy?  And some 300-pound homoerotic man comes in and smothers you in white shoes.  Oh, I'm full.  Dr. Death is here.  Oh, Dr. Death.  Hope you brought the hot girl.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, that is great, man.  We were laughing.  It's just that scene out of Godfather 2. 
[03:02:30]  The politician where he's sitting there on the bed and the hooker is just bleeding from everywhere.  We were just hearing it.  I don't know what happened.  I fell asleep.  Don't worry.  The Corleone family will take care of it.  Vato Corleone.  It's just every bad movie.  Yeah.  This is Principal Seymour Skinner.  And rather than detention, you've chosen to listen to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:03:00]  Opie?  Opie and Anthony.  The New Beat Anthony Show.  And now, the worst.  Just pathetic.  Of Opie and Anthony.  They call it toilet humor.  Toilet humor.  But first, sexual pleasure.  Oh, wire.  The buttocks and the anus.  The buttocks and the anus.  Sexual pleasure.  Not sure what year this is from, but the narrator reminds me. 
[03:03:30]  That would be Danny writing this.  Of Alan Funt talking about the buttocks and the anus.  Sexual pleasure.  Pleasure.  Pleasure.  Candid camera.  Buttocks are one of the major erogenous zones of women, and it is a known fact that man's  greatest pleasure is in the natural parts of a woman.  And second only to the female breast, the buttocks are a visual turn-on.  Not too many years ago, the buttocks were taboo as a sex object. 
[03:04:00]  This is Don Kirshner for Don Kirshner's rock concert.  And now, Casey and the Sunshine Band will play as I fondle his buttocks.  Could there have been a worse, less charismatic host than Don Kirshner?  Yeah.  Oh, boy, was he a dull fella.  He started videos, though.  Oh, he was great.  He started MTV.  I mean, not MTV, but the fact that...  What am I trying to say?  I don't know.  Fuck it.  I need to pick out a TV for Christmas.  Flat screen.  Go with the 40. 
[03:04:30]  All right, let's go back to this.  The buttocks.  ...as a sex object.  Now, with permissive sex attitudes, penetration from the rear, and analingus are considered  perfectly normal.  Anal sexual practices play as much a part in heterosexual relationships as in homosexual  ones.  They love the assholes.  The homo.  ...are stimulated by the contemplation of the posterior.  They also like to include this part of the body in their sexual practices. 
[03:05:00]  The buttocks, the anus, and the ridge between the actual sex organs, perineum, are among the  most erogenous zones in both men and women.  In spite of this, anal eroticism is still subjected to many taboos.  However, with today's more permissive sexual attitudes, heterosexual anal intercourse is being  more widely practiced by young people.  Hmm.  All right.  That guy, by the way. 
[03:05:30]  You go, kids.  That guy talking, he's the worst person alive.  Why?  This is a fantastic way to talk about analingus.  Analingus.  He's wonderful.  Wonderful, wonderful.  I like to call it the car wash.  The prostate massage inside your asshole.  And the posterior.  And when she's rubbing the back of your leg, if her finger brushes where the shit comes  out, it's going to be a sexual massage.  Damn, you dig it.  I knew that you could.  Tony, will you dance with me?  If she drapes you and her finger does not go near the posterior, you're probably going 
[03:06:00]  to be ripped off for $80.  But if her fingernail comes out and there's a little bit of shit underneath the nail, be  prepared to hand over another hundred.  Now, let's view two girls, one cup.  This one topping the charts this week.  This is how the posterior is emptied before analingus or anal stimulation is noticed that  her asshole opens like a dolphin's pee hole. 
[03:06:30]  Let's talk about gaping.  Gaping.  Huge, gaping assholes can be fun.  I said pee hole.  I suck.  It doesn't matter.  A pee hole.  A porthole.  Whatever the fuck they call it.  Let's learn more.  You should know you have one.  I said...  On sweatier girls, this area will smell like an armpit.  We got it, though. 
[03:07:00]  Rub your hand under your own armpit to get deodorant on it.  Put it in her vagina.  If she screams bloody murder, her pussy is tainted.  Ask her what she's eaten first.  At times, you will go to stimulate the posterior and feel like you fell into a sinkhole over  a septic tank.  Make sure she has not eaten ethnic food.  If she has pomegranate seeds hanging from her asshole, those are hemorrhoids.  Stay away.  She should be well-groomed in the rear area. 
[03:07:30]  It should not look like a sea urchin eating a guppy.  Be careful, while having anal sex, that you do not pull out too quickly and get the pink  sock, where it looks like the pool lining of the asshole is gripping your cock and pulling  it back in.  Pink sock is always funny.  It looks like the asshole has a proboscis.  Do you want to learn more or what? 
[03:08:00]  If you can't get your pink sock back in, just get on all fours, walk backwards, and make  elephant noises.  Try to pick up peanuts until your asshole has receded.  You'll know she's pink socking if her asshole looks like an aardvark.  That's the first word in the dictionary because it starts with two A's.  Like asshole, which is what I am.  Can we learn more about the buttocks and the anus, please?  The latest survey shows that nearly one-quarter of all females and more than one-quarter of 
[03:08:30]  all males and more than one-quarter of married couples under 35 had performed anal intercourse  at least once in the last year.  Now, what this means is that at least three-quarters have said, if you touch my asshole, I'm divorcing  you.  If you stick your dick in her asshole and pull it out and squeeze the tip of your dick  and shit comes out like a Plateau spaghetti maker, you want to perform an enema on your 
[03:09:00]  dirty wife's asshole.  I don't mind people doing an impression of me, but when Robert does it, he makes me sound  like Blair's cousin, Jerry.  This guy rules.  The act itself is relatively safe and sanitary if proper precautions and good hygiene are 
[03:09:30]  exercised.  Many couples find anal intercourse exciting, pleasurable, and different, and if both partners  consent, they should feel free to participate.  Naturally, thorough washing is appropriate and lubricants should be applied to the penis and  to the anal opening.  This is most important to facilitate entry.  If vaginal intercourse is contemplated directly after anal intercourse, the penis should be 
[03:10:00]  thoroughly washed to prevent feckle bacteria in the rectum from contaminating the vagina  and causing possible infection.  Infection.  Then, please call me, your accountant, and I'll get you poppy bonds.  No double dipping in the vagina and the asshole.  It's very much like eating chips at a dinner party.  It really is.  All of a sudden, it's going to look like you're gardening and then put your hands in the mayonnaise 
[03:10:30]  jar.  This last clip, this was a video documentary, but Danny can't find the actual video?  I don't want to see that.  What I'd find is the audio, but apparently, this was a video documentary.  This track would probably be better with the accompanying video, but I think it works quite  well on its own.  Does he have a mustache?  Okay.  Because what you're going to hear is him describing what he's watching. 
[03:11:00]  Ah.  All right?  One quarter of all married couples engage in anal sex.  Yes.  Which means that the other 75% need a Vicodin crushed up and put in their supper.  When they fall asleep, straddle them like the horses that they are and put it where the  duty comes out.  Deny it in the morning.  Tell us you had a bad dream.  Get gauze and put it on the asshole.  You're lucky that was funny.  Fall asleep.  Did I say that?  And then you fucked some other word up, too. 
[03:11:30]  Did I?  Well, I don't know.  I don't talk too good.  Fall asleep.  And when I said seep, I was thinking what her asshole will do with your semen.  Clicky.  Pudding and cream parfait.  Feed her chili the night before.  See if you can find the kidney bean skins the next day.  When she sneezes, her asshole will look like E-Roc coughing up cinnamon.  Poor E-Roc.  As you can see, there are anatomical differences in the shape and size of the various models' 
[03:12:00]  buttocks.  And the camera's sharp eye gives you an unbelievable close-up of the positioning between the anal  canal and the vaginal canal.  See the very important...  This one right here, the small pink one, belongs to a healthy married woman.  And this larger one, with the donkeys taking tourists into the middle of it, belongs to  a gay man in New York City. 
[03:12:30]  If you want to know about anal sex, talk to Dr. Zoidberg.  He will teach you.  That's right.  I am actually the only doctor who is less pleasant than Dr. Zell.  This guy's a creep.  He's certainly...  What is he, looking at fucking video of assholes?  He loves the butt-up.  That's great.  And the anus.  ...close-up of the positioning between the anal canal and the vaginal canal.  See the very important anatomical... 
[03:13:00]  See the amazing asshole.  ...of the female buttocks and vaginacs.  ...as these attractive models kneel, squat, bend over, and assume many other rear-entry  intercourse positions.  Especially note the camera shot of the model as she contracts her sphincter muscle and see  her anal opening contracting at the same time.  You are witnessing the most revealing cinematography close-up shots.  Shots revealing the feminine mystique of the female buttocks. 
[03:13:30]  Yes, attractive buttocks are a visual turn-on, and the buttocks of both sexes very often  favorably respond to erotic caresses, massage, and other forms of stimulation.  Pay more attention to the buttocks during lovemaking and see what happens.  If your partner's reaction is favorable, it's another plus.  That's wonderful. 
[03:14:00]  That is...  I'd love to see that footage.  You're the most amazing cinematography.  Ever.  And now brought to you by Steven Spielberg.  In Illustrious Panavision.  You want to move on to the compliment box, and then we'll get back to Harry Potter in  a minute or two?  Compliment box?  This is so stupid.  Stupid.  I don't know. 
[03:14:30]  Down there in Washington, D.C., you're walking along.  Yeah, you could be walking down the sidewalk, I guess, in Washington, D.C., and all of a sudden  a voice comes out of nowhere, and it compliments you.  Usually a voice comes out of nowhere and conks you over the head.  Yeah, there you go.  So where's your money?  Here's the story.  Wonderful city.  Yeah.  You stand out in a crowd.  Walking this street in downtown Washington, D.C. is leaving some local residents blushing.  It said people are drawn to your personality.  Walk by again, and some say this box may even inspire a little pep in your step. 
[03:15:00]  That box would be everywhere, really.  It should be downtown.  Most people agree with you.  See that?  See?  Most people agree with you.  It's been coined the compliment machine, randomly doling out kind words to anyone willing  to lend an ear.  I've had my moments, and I'm like, just turn it off.  But overall, no, I enjoy it.  One of my customers came in and said, it told me I smell good.  I know I don't.  I just finished jogging.  He was streaming sweat.  So, yeah, people are having fun with it. 
[03:15:30]  Are they having fun with it?  You're white.  What are you doing in this neighborhood?  I would leave if I was you.  God damn rich cunt.  I set all that up for the other side, see?  I was going to peep it, and I realized where I was.  Yeah.  The machine is part of a larger, temporary art exhibit called Sites Project DC. 
[03:16:00]  The technology is simple.  Inside is an MP3 player with more than 100 pre-recorded compliments playing every few minutes.  You inspire others.  It's really just to explore, I guess, the idea of compliments, how people give them, how people receive them.  Kind of like a fortune cookie kind of idea.  God almighty.  You get it, and you're like, oh, yeah, okay, I am generous. 
[03:16:30]  While the machine is about as accurate as a fortune cookie, Greaves hopes its kind words will make anyone feel special.  Maybe the city likes the idea, and they make these compliment boxes, and they put them all around the city.  And then other cities might do it, or, you know, around the region.  A lot.  Just kind of as, like, a public service.  Might do it?  No, I don't think I'm going to believe the box on the street.  Do you really know how to take a compliment?  Might do it?  No, we will do it.  We'll do our own version of this.  He said, I can smell your cunt. 
[03:17:00]  They should ask people, after they walk by the compliment box, do this actually make you feel better?  Anyone who says yes should just be put against the wall and shot.  Should be zapped.  This is a giant cock.  Those are great.  Someone is suggesting that they should have Steve voice these compliment boxes.  You're a woman. 
[03:17:30]  You stink.  You have something called a vagina that I have no interest in.  Yeah, Steve doing them.  Cock meat.  Nothing but cock meat.  And it just has to get racist.  It's amazing.  You should see the ones coming in.  Your pussy doesn't quite smell like fish.  Thank you?  Toss let rain. 
[03:18:00]  This is the dumbest idea.  It's like this phony feel good waste of time and money and effort.  What the hell is that going to do for anybody?  You can't say you believe it because it's all random.  It could be the worst despicable guy that just raped somebody walking past this thing.  Right.  You're a wonderful person. 
[03:18:30]  I know, motherfucker.  That's right.  Oh, Jesus.  Some just pedophile walking.  Yeah.  Some creep.  Still has blood on his hands.  You're a great person.  You work well with others.  Yeah, I do.  Maybe I should tell them where the body's hidden.  That'll get me inspired.  Oh, boy.  You know, Les makes a good observation here on the phones. 
[03:19:00]  Les, the trucker.  Les, what's up?  Yeah, A-O-N-A and Jimmy.  They took Jimmy's tender sentiment idea and made that comment box.  You know that, right?  Tender sentiments.  That's right.  This is the tender sentiment thing when you're feeling down on yourself.  I like a compliment box.  Yeah.  Oh, sorry.  Thank you, Les.  Are you about a size 14?  Hey, what do you?  All right. 
[03:19:30]  What?  All right.  I want the boys in the O&A lab to make our version of the compliment box.  How are we going to do it?  Are we going to use an MP3 player that randomly does?  No, we have to do it live.  I would jerk off to you.  Oh.  Why, thank you.  Oh, God.  Can you imagine if we could reprogram that MP3?  Oh.  In that box?  Why are we at the other side?  We could be doing this bit today.  You have cranky ass. 
[03:20:00]  They weren't all winners, kids.  Okay.  All right.  I thought for sure.  All right.  Well, it's a dumb idea.  Hmm?  It's a dumb idea.  What? 
[03:20:30]  I dub it a dumb idea.  Why would you do that?  It's phony.  Yeah.  More of that phony, feel-good, fake shit.  Rocks aren't candy.  How can you add that?  Your family crops you out of photographs.  Your mother drank during pregnancy. 
[03:21:00]  Is that too rough?  By the way, can I interrupt everybody, please?  When?  A hanger would have solved a lot of problems.  You'll have to be cared for until you're 50.  Then you'll just die.  Goodness gracious. 
[03:21:30]  Goodness gracious.  I just want people to acknowledge.  Yeah.  I'm convinced that terrorists are burning America.  When are you guys going to go with my theory?  It's going to take a little while.  MSNBC is now reporting that there are 49 large fires.  Okay.  49 large fires.  You're right.  You're right.  But, oh, look at the temperatures.  It's 115 west of the Mississippi. 
[03:22:00]  If the terrorists have a weather machine that's doing that, we are truly fucked.  I think terrorists are burning America.  Yeah.  49 large fires.  They just start fires and, like, they're trying to burn.  That's a lot more than usual, man.  It's dry this time of year every year.  What will that do?  Huh?  What will that do?  I don't know.  You don't know what their grand scheme is?  I haven't fully thought it out.  I haven't thought it out.  You just think they're, like, lighting matches and throwing them out windows and going, ha-ha, 
[03:22:30]  this will put the World Trade Center to shame.  I'm just a bit suspicious.  That's all.  Hmm.  Ooh.  Millions of muggles learn what happens to their hero.  Oh.  Right after the 49 large fires, they went with a Harry Potter mania story.  Fans of muggle.  Said so on his book.  Oh, compliment box.  Oh, boy.  You have the comprehension skills of a bag of oats.  Oh, my God. 
[03:23:00]  One that could do magic is a muggaloid.  One that could do magic is a muggaloid.  Oh.  Back.  One back.  Muggaloid.  People don't want to eat food you've touched.  Ever. 
[03:23:30]  You make noises when you should be quiet.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  You embarrass your family by going in the movie theater. 
[03:24:00]  You get caught jerking off a lot and don't seem to care.  You've killed all your pets before they were a Wigol.  The cat is not food. 
[03:24:30]  You tried to pet a kitten with a hammer.  You couldn't care for a rock.  Your real name is Eric.  Sorry, Muggle. 
[03:25:00]  Your body is 70% skull.  We're running out of steam.  Yeah.  Hey, this is Bob Saget.  Yeah, it rhymes with faggot.  I had a fucked up childhood.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  And now, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  This show sucks.  It's awful.  Why is banana phone playing? 
[03:25:30]  Oh.  That doesn't sound like Elvis.  Opie's phone.  Hello?  It's not about ratings.  Shut up.  Who's this?  It's not about good ratings.  Shut up.  Exactly.  Citibank.  I don't even know my job.  Oh, God.  You fucking asshole.  Hang up, cunt face.  Shut up, you fucking bank piece of shit.  We know what you are.  After 11 o'clock.  All Jews.  Jews.  After 11.  Citibank is for faggots.  I got the TV on.  Yeah.  Sperm bank. 
[03:26:00]  How about that?  Swallow your receipts.  By the way.  Your fucking robbery.  It's all robbery.  Your fucking fees on your machines.  By the way, look at my accounts.  I get paid to do this.  All right.  I'll hang up already.  Fuck you.  They just want to milk me for all its words.  I'll talk to you later.  Take your money.  Fucking money lender.  I was just kidding.  Oh, they are.  It's a bank.  Fuck.  Ah, that's that old jack. 
[03:26:30]  A lot of people saying that they're psyched that you're here, Keith.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  That'll change in a couple of minutes.  Flight of the Valkyries.  Right.  All right.  Sweet Caroline by us.  It's not flight.  It's ride.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be flight.  Flight of the Bumblebee.  Flight of the Bumblebee.  That song makes me nervous.  I feel like I should be doing something.  Keith brought up a great point on the way in.  It's so fucking cold outside that people are just cursing to them.  They are.  We're on the elevator, and there's people you don't know on the elevator, and you walk 
[03:27:00]  in because you're just out of the cold, and you're just standing there going, fuck.  Shit.  Fuck.  It's fucking shit.  And that's how people are bonding, actually.  Like, fuck.  They look at each other.  Yeah.  You walk into a building out of a cold spot.  You just look at each other and go, fuck.  You kind of point at the door and go, shit.  But people know what you mean.  Like, someone will go, fuck, and you go, I know, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  Fuck, shit.  Fuck, shit. 
[03:27:30]  Ridiculous out there.  Right.  I said it was Everest cold out, and Jimmy had to tell me, you know, it's 100-mile-an-hour  winds up there, and the temperatures are a lot colder.  So, Jimmy let me know it was a little colder on Everest than it is outside of New York right  now.  Well, and then here's what I said, which really, I should be fucking just cracked across  my open mouth.  I said, that's the cruising altitude of an airplane.  Just the fact that I said airplane, that's like a five-year-old speaking.  Fuck it.  What else could be cruising at that?  Airplanes are up there. 
[03:28:00]  What else cruises at that altitude?  Faggots in spacesuits?  Whoa.  Watch that F-word.  Oh, yeah, right.  You're up on the F-word, right?  The new F-word, because the old F-word doesn't matter anymore.  No, the old F-word used to be fuck.  We should be calling it the new F-word.  Pretty soon, everything will just be an initial.  That word, yeah.  Yeah, you'll just be able to have an acronym for people.  He's just an effing F.  Are you a fan of banning the N-word there, Keith?  No.  Nigger needs to be said.  Nigger can be said. 
[03:28:30]  It can always be said.  Nigger can be said.  Faggot should be allowed all the time.  Someone said it best on our show.  I would love to give them credit, but they're like, look, you can use the word all you want,  but there's a consequence for using it.  And I agree with that.  Well, I mean, it is a consequence, but everybody in here should be able to say nigger.  I should be able to say.  Oh, we do.  I know you do.  With the mics on and off.  Usually in my car.  I wouldn't like it if it would be when the mic's off, but you guys just let it sail. 
[03:29:00]  Look, there are consequences.  When I saw you in the elevator with us something, I was like, I didn't know I was coming by today.  Do you love Ann Coulter?  I love her.  Yeah.  I love that she's not taking any shit about it.  And she won't apologize.  Yeah.  You have to love Ann Coulter.  Good.  I love her.  She's still goofing on her.  Going, yeah, whatever.  I said it.  Go fuck yourself.  A big man neck.  You do have to love her fucking ignorance.  Yeah.  Big Adam Zapp will go, gulp.  Am I in trouble?  Gulp.  Half a man. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, and everybody's trying to distance themselves from her, and she's just still going.  I love it.  She don't care.  It's great.  But, yeah, I think that whatever you want to use.  Some people go, it's un-American.  That word should be banned.  And it's like, you just put those two statements together?  Banning words and un-American?  Right, right.  Fucking Constitution.  It's the amendment they figured to make the first.  It was the most important one.  Let's make it number fucking one. 
[03:30:00]  And then they talk about banning words because they're offensive.  There's no right.  It says you have the right to not be offended.  Well, I don't, you know, the thing to me, I want to see, it's like they should have like  words, the top words, like the top faggot is coming up.  It's almost a...  Faggot coming up the charts.  Yes, coming up the charts.  Nigger's still coming in as number one.  He's still holding his top slot, but faggot is on his way.  Faggot's on its way up the charts.  A few more big people use that word.  We need one more person. 
[03:30:30]  We need one more person.  One more big person to say faggot.  And honky hasn't been on the charts in 20 years.  He's been a long time since the Jefferson's.  Yeah, exactly.  Honky.  Honky.  No matter how hard you try, you can say it as hard as you want.  You honkies are getting on my nerves.  They'll just laugh.  Ah, you guys.  I got to be honest, we've always laughed at honky.  It's just silly.  And it's never been used in a bad way, except maybe in an old Clint Eastwood movie.  But it's always been like a funny kind of term to use on the Jeffersons, like you said. 
[03:31:00]  But even Archie Bunker never said nigger.  You know?  I mean, that was always kind of like, meh.  I think Archie Bunker even said the N-word back then.  Even he was politically correct.  Yeah.  I don't think...  But now by saying the N-word, you're saying the word.  Yes.  So now they're going to have to ban saying N-word.  N-word.  After that.  Yeah, we said they're just going to have to go, mm, mm, mm, mm.  And they're trying to ban the word, mm, mm, because the N-word is now just as bad as  the word because you're just replacing it.  I want a few more attacks on faggot word.  I want to hear faggot more. 
[03:31:30]  That's what I want to hear.  That'll bring it back up.  I want it up to where it's supposed to be.  Faggot number two.  Faggot is timeless, man.  I love that word.  We're talking about it like it's fucking Dark Side of the Moon.  It's just great.  It's always going to be on the charts.  It's just there.  It's a classic.  It rolls off your tongue just right.  Yeah.  Faggot.  Give it a whirl.  Faggot.  Ugh.  Faggot.  Faggot.  Ugh.  It is.  It's funny, happy.  You faggot.  Get out of here, faggot.  It works in every way possible.  Every way.  Happy and a faggot. 
[03:32:00]  Angry.  Yeah.  You tell it.  You can say it to your friends knowing they're not gay.  You just go, stop.  Don't be a faggot.  Get your keys.  We're fucking going out.  You know what?  In the neighborhood, we can use both words in the same sentence.  You faggot-ass niggas are getting on my nerves.  Look at that.  Beautiful.  And it means no hate speech there whatsoever.  There's nothing hateful about it.  You love the person you're saying it to.  Yeah.  But you could be sad saying that thing, too.  Like, you could be going, what's the matter?  My son's a faggot.  And he's saying the nigger. 
[03:32:30]  And he's saying the nigger.  Wow.  Is that the only two words that are offensive that people want to say?  I don't know.  No, no.  Squaw.  Squaw.  Squaw is working its way up now, but I don't think it's got popular support.  Indians do not like the word squaw.  That's like an R&B song.  It's not pop yet.  I know.  Yeah.  It's kind of laying low.  It's not a crossover hit yet.  It's a category that no one cares about.  But the Indians have been successful with getting teams to change their names, sports teams, 
[03:33:00]  to change their names.  The Redskins.  Well, the Redskins still.  I mean, a few more.  Like, the Redmen.  The Redmen changed their names.  Red Storm.  The Kansas City Chiefs, like I said, you know, nope.  We're not changing.  No, like pro sports.  But, yeah, enough money.  I agree with the Indians, though, on this one.  I'm not the Squaw.  How do you agree with the Indians?  Because they're the only group that's allowed to be kind of car.  I heard them explaining it one time on a talk show, and they were just like, look, they're  cartooning us.  And if you do that with another group, I mean, the Fighting Irish, the Irish just don't care. 
[03:33:30]  But Indians kind of have a history in this country of, you know, mass slaughter and  genocide.  You know, I get their point on it.  Redskins was a term used to pile up Indian bodies.  That was a pile of redskins.  That was how that term came into effect.  I thought it was just their redskins.  No, it was like.  No.  There's always some horrible story to it.  You know where the word coffee pot came from?  What the fuck happened?  I really am a fucking mood killer at the Super Bowl.  Oh, shit, dude.  The real history behind the Indians, shit, you know, what the fuck? 
[03:34:00]  I just wanted to do my tomahawk chopper.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You know what, Jim?  There's no history behind the word nigger.  No, that's nothing.  Yeah, there's no team called that either.  All right, let's start one.  Believe me.  You know, the history of the Indians, they were really treated bad.  Nigger is great.  But when they start saying, look, the Jersey niggers lost by eight points tonight, then you'll  be correct.  You can't name a team after Blackie.  But how great would that be if one of the NBA teams decided to change their name?  Oh, my God. 
[03:34:30]  Well, with all the hip-hop artists and basketball teams, you may get it.  Yeah, I get it.  KZ on the Nets, right?  Wearing the swag, wearing the shirts, the team logo.  Just make it N-I-G-G-A-S.  The Brooklyn niggers.  Yeah, niggers.  That would be nice.  By the way, we're having fun, but I've got to just acknowledge something.  Opie.  I went to chew this pan.  Don Rickles?  Oh, I thought you were going to go, we all love each other here.  We're having a lot of fun with these words, people.  Hockey puck.  I just went to chew this pan, and it's a pre-chewed pan that someone else chewed because I did 
[03:35:00]  not recognize my own chewing.  It's probably you.  No.  Oh, you recognize, what, do you leave a fucking mark on there that you can identify?  You know when you're, yeah, you just know.  CSI, you know the bite pattern.  I want to puke.  Why?  Just because maybe someone else had it behind it.  You ever smell somebody's, like...  Oh, smell this.  No, I will not.  Smell it.  Under no circumstances.  Why?  Intern, smell it.  Why?  Get an intern in here.  Scum.  Yes.  All right.  Just get a... 
[03:35:30]  Intern's going to be a word that they...  The I word.  It's just going to be the I word.  I like this, kid.  This is Jeremy from Atlanta.  Let's see if we can get him this.  He's a go-getter.  He's a good boy.  Oh, by the way, someone's reminding us, you know, we're not going to do the obvious and  play sparkling wiggles for Keith today, but the definition of the N word, Louis CK explained  it perfectly.  Do we have that?  I wish we had that.  Well, something can get it.  Yeah, I know.  Something can get it.  Yeah, go find that.  A white guy gave you the definition of... 
[03:36:00]  No, Louis.  Louis Mexican.  Oh, right.  It was the origin of the word.  The actual origin.  It's always Mexican convenient.  Yeah, I wouldn't be right.  He's Mexican when he needs a federal grant.  Do you hear...  Best definition for the word, by the way, coming up.  It's actually the origin of the word.  The origin.  Yeah.  Yes.  Our own black girl works on the Ron and Fez show.  He fancies himself part Cherokee Indian.  Jeez.  Yeah, and I just read in the paper that the Cherokee Indians are throwing out all the blacks, 
[03:36:30]  saying that they're not Cherokee anymore because the way they got to be Cherokee was they  were actually slaves owned by the Indians.  And the Cherokee Nation decided that they could become Cherokees.  But the Indians own slaves too?  Yes.  The Indians own slaves.  I didn't know that.  And they could then become Cherokee Indians.  And now recently, the day after Black History Month, Cherokees got out of a little meeting,  a little powwow, and decided, get the blacks out.  Beat it.  We don't want them anymore.  Beat it.  So they're not entitled to any of the privileges that the Indians are. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah.  No casinos for you.  No casinos.  You ever go to the casinos in Mohegans?  I never see an Indian.  That black guy.  Yeah.  A bunch of black guys.  They're running the joint.  I run this shit.  I'm Indian.  Fucking Apache, asshole.  What's your next question?  Shut up.  Double down on that.  I need some money.  Joe from Illinois.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, fellas.  How's it going this morning?  How do you do, Joe?  What up, Joe?  Yeah, I was called to tell you. 
[03:37:30]  They just took away the Illini's Chief Illini wig.  The what?  Yeah, they took away our mascot.  The Illini's University of Illinois basketball team, man.  Oh, yeah?  Good.  Yeah, they just took away their mascot.  Oh, fuck it.  Fuck the mascot.  No!  What's next?  Who's next?  Exactly.  Chief Alanaway.  Here you go.  Fuck you.  We've been enjoying the mascots all these years.  You enjoy the mascots.  Oh, I know.  I hate them.  Where's him next to Philly Phanatic?  You gotta stop.  What was the Braves mascot?  Every time a homer was hit, he would kind of jump up. 
[03:38:00]  Chief Nakahoma?  Oh, exactly.  Or is he from the other?  I don't know.  I want him back.  How about this?  All right.  How about this?  Let's get it.  For the WNBA, how about Team Lippy?  And the fucking mascot is a woman with a fucking zipped up mouth and a black eye.  How about that?  Team Lippy.  Lippy.  Team Lippy.  Team dinner was late.  You mean Team Licky?  No, Lippy.  We're fucking being punched in the mouth by our husband.  Yeah, well.  I want our mascots back.  But if you say the Philly Phanatic and stuff, they're going to say that it's goofing on retards. 
[03:38:30]  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  Because it acts retarded.  Who's next?  You can't get rid of the mascots.  But it's not.  Save the mascots.  Mr. Met, I could see being a Down Syndrome parody.  Big fucking waterhead.  Mr. Met, big baseball-headed goof.  But Chief Waka-Hoo and all that shit, man.  Waka-Hoo.  I don't blame.  Oh, they're just trying to have a little fun, Jimmy.  And what?  Now no fucking reruns of F Troop because of the fucking Hakawi Indians?  You don't remove what?  They went, where the Hakawi?  Are you dating an Indian woman? 
[03:39:00]  Why?  I wish I was because they had big pussies.  Do they?  The kid's like a papoose.  They carry their young in it.  Hey, you want the origin of the word?  Yes.  Give me the word.  All right.  From Louis C.K.  Where nigger came from originally?  There was some black guy being a nigger.  And so they called him a nigger.  It's good for y'all.  And that's where it started.  It just was a nigger was a feeling. 
[03:39:30]  He's just like this.  Look at him just.  Yeah, was it some wordplay?  Just blurting out a sound that it came out like that.  Just the guy was being such a nigger that he fucking made someone say the word.  Fucking God.  Hey, Patricia's helping it along, too, there.  Jesus Christ.  He wasn't disagreeing, man.  He was being so serious, though, because we had just found out the definition of what word?  Of kike.  Yeah.  Of course, the Jewish slur.  And so Louis goes, you know what the definition or the origin of the word nigger is? 
[03:40:00]  And we were, like, looking at him all like, what?  Like, wow, we want to know.  And he comes out with that.  And we're like, you fucking asshole.  Well, I was buying this.  This is healthier.  The origin.  Yeah.  Origin.  Yeah, it's like a spelling bee.  Origin, please.  What's the matter, Opie?  Sweetie.  This is the healthier version of the parfait.  I like a parfait.  But it's healthy.  Yeah.  If you don't like it, I'll give you the...  All right. 
[03:40:30]  Thank you, Kenny.  The bottom part of that looks like the shoes of a sexually abused airline passenger.  Oh, thanks.  What is that?  Yeah, as I drink a smoothie.  Oh, he's got a little bleeding of the testicles.  Yeah, Chief Nakahoma was the Braves' mascot.  Chief Nakahoma.  Nakahoma.  See, it sounds like an Indian, but it's Nakahome run.  Like, hit a...  You get it, Jimmy?  Fucking awful.  Why?  You remember, they had...  What was the wrestler?  Chief J. Strongbow.  Yes.  All of, you know. 
[03:41:00]  What about the wrestlers that have these names?  Yeah.  You know.  The Iron Sheik?  Yeah, the Iron Sheik.  Total fucking stereotype of a...  He wore the curly fucking old shoes they haven't worn in centuries.  He was horrific.  That guy was great.  Down with America.  Fucking guy.  Wrestlers are slightly different in that they all parody different.  Every ethnicity kind of gets it.  But then again, you're right.  What's the mascot doing?  You don't see a Jew.  You don't see a Jew wrestler. 
[03:41:30]  Here he is.  You know.  I'm in the banker.  You know, just a naughty Jew with a big nose.  I'm going to out-wrestle you!  And all he does is send his lawyer out to sue the wrestler once he hits him.  Dude, how fucking great would that be?  That'd be a great gimmick.  Where's Vince?  All he says is lawyer talking for me.  He's at the pay us and stuff.  He's shadow boxing.  Yeah, he's like shadow boxing, but never actually goes in the ring and does anything.  Yeah.  His lawyer just serves papers to everyone in the ring.  Well, you know what?  That's what it is.  I think the Jewish folk never really get it like that. 
[03:42:00]  Never.  Why?  Because we're scared of that.  You know what happens?  Because everyone's scared of that.  Well, because they run the media.  They have been through so much oppression and slavery.  Oh, wait a minute.  What are you talking to?  Well, Brando got in trouble because he was being interviewed and he goes, you know, Hollywood  has never cartooned or parodied the kike.  He said they have.  Wow, he actually said it like that?  Yes, he did.  But he wasn't saying that to be racist.  What he was saying is that they've done like the Dago, the Negro.  He said they've done every race, like blaxploitation movies or mafia movies, have taken the stereotype 
[03:42:30]  of an Italian as a guinea.  It's a mafia guinea.  That's a stereotype of an Italian.  So he said they've never shown the kike, which is the parody of the Jew.  They just don't show you that in Hollywood.  Well, it was done in another country between the mid-30s to mid-40s.  A lot of cartoons, a lot of posters were put up parodying the Jewish person.  Where?  Berlin.  Poland.  France.  You want me to expand? 
[03:43:00]  In Iraq right now.  Hey, let's go to Bruce in Memphis.  Bruce.  Yeah, it's Rooster, not Bruce.  All right, Rooster.  What's up, Bruce?  What's up, Bruce?  Rooster.  Normally, I absolutely love Jimmy, but I can't believe what a fucking hypocrite he's being.  Not being a hypocrite, dude.  First of all, why am I being a hypocrite?  Because you have defended people's right to talk about everybody.  I am part Cherokee.  Dude.  And I think that the Cherokee Nation needs to rise up and have a little thicker skin about 
[03:43:30]  their name.  Let me say, I agree.  Talking about anybody is different than cartooning them in it.  And I'm not politically correct, but they are the only group that you're allowed to do  that to.  It bugs them.  And I think that they're right to be irritated by it.  If you did it with blacks, like, I think you should be able to talk about everybody, but  you can't cartoon everybody in a mascot, can you?  You can't do it with blacks.  You can't do it with Jews.  You can't do it in any other group where it's acceptable.  But we've proven the Indians are weak, so it doesn't matter. 
[03:44:00]  Oh, no, no.  Yeah, exactly.  Believe me.  Why don't we just have them running around with an anthrax blanket on?  I mean, come on.  Yeah, we were the first terrorists.  Let's stuff in here.  Isn't that kind of cool, though?  Like, they're not naming a fucking, you know, weak piece of shit thing after an Indian.  They're naming, like, a fucking football team, man.  The Chiefs.  Like, you know.  Kansas City Chiefs.  It's like you want a name that shows energy and courage and bravery.  That's why they picked the name.  The Tomahawk Chop.  It's not the Kansas City Chief faggots. 
[03:44:30]  Right.  It's like the fucking, you know.  It's like a, I think it's kind of showing that they're powerful and kind of, you know.  Yeah, say that when they're 3-13.  And fucking it's halftime.  Hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya, hey-ya.  I will give it to you that fans are idiots.  Oh, my God.  And the mascots do have to look a little goofy.  They just run out.  I like the Tomahawk Chop.  Although I believe the Redmen's mascot, wasn't that just a guy dressed like an Indian?  Mm-hmm.  Like legitimately with the headdress and the makeup and stuff like that?  He was a warrior. 
[03:45:00]  A warrior.  Like it wasn't like the goofy, big-headed fucking, you know, Mardi Gras float head Indian.  How terrific.  Smoking a peace pipe.  How terrific.  Chief Nakahoma can fuck his mother.  Chief Nakahoma stinks.  He's a fucking clit.  Fucking hate Chief Nakahoma.  Hey-ya, the man Nakahoma, didn't he?  Fuck you.  You hate Chief Nakahoma.  You really do.  I would love them to say that he's HIV positive. 
[03:45:30]  All right, all right.  Chief Waste Away-ya.  Can you please call up with other mascots?  Holy shit.  Because we hit Jimmy's button today.  I'm not going to.  I wish I could remember some more of these mascots.  I can't often.  I think a mascot touched him when he was a baby.  Yeah.  That's what happened.  You got the red skin.  Chief Nakahoma grabbed his fucking cock.  Damn.  Nakahoma.  It was his first baseball game.  Yeah.  He went to the bathroom by himself.  Hey there, son. 
[03:46:00]  You need a little help?  Put his tomahawk on your ball sack.  I'm Chief Nakahoma.  Yeah.  Come here.  Oh, please call up with other mascots.  Please.  We just don't have that knowledge right now.  Yeah, you got the Cleveland Indians.  You know, they like naming their teams after their coach.  I know.  Well, you know what?  Again, it's legal, but it should just be enough already.  Get over it.  Fucking change the name of your shit dick team.  What, are people not going to root for the Redskins? 
[03:46:30]  People fucking root for the, when the fucking Colts moved and came back as the Ravens,  they rooted for them.  What the fuck?  What about the Cowboys?  Well, the Cowboys had the, it was, he had a black, it was a black guy who was dressed  as a cowboy.  Yes.  And I think he came to Philadelphia and they beat the shit out of him.  Of course they did.  Oh, they beat him.  It's like, what the fuck?  He had a Cowboy shooting his gun.  Oh, the black guy?  Wow, wow.  Wait, why did they pick a black guy to be a Cowboy in Dallas?  The mascot is a Nick. 
[03:47:00]  What's that?  A Nick.  I said the mascot is a Nick.  Yeah, I never thought about that before.  A black Cowboy in Dallas is a little strange.  Well, yeah.  We've been to Dallas a few times.  I'm surprised at that flow.  And that's through the years.  He's been there a long time.  I think he's dead, actually.  He got beat up in Philly?  Yeah, I think he was beaten pretty good in Philadelphia.  Philly is the worst.  Philly brothers are rough, man.  In between Santa Claus getting pegged with batteries.  You should fucking travel with a construction worker or a biker and an Indian. 
[03:47:30]  Philadelphia has the worst white guys you ever want to see.  It's got to be the worst white guys.  It is.  It's just awful.  What about the guys with the Philly beards?  They're like...  No, the long beards?  Yeah.  That's the...  They're a problem.  No, no.  There's a problem there, too.  The Philly white guys are the worst.  They're big.  They're thick-necked.  These thick-necked white boys are the worst.  They're Boston white guys are...  They're number two.  Number two?  Yes.  Philly white guys are number one. 
[03:48:00]  But at least in Boston, you know where you can go and where you can't go kind of a thing.  Right.  You know, you're not going to go fucking into Southie and just bust into a bar and go,  Hey, niggas, what's up?  You know?  Like Philly, though.  I'm at the game, the Philadelphia Eagles game.  I'm a Cowboy fan.  And there's a guy walking through with just a Georgetown hat.  They started blowing him and throwing beer on him.  He's like, This is Georgetown.  It's a basketball team.  We don't give a fuck.  Get out of here. 
[03:48:30]  Animals.  They are animals.  You got to love them.  Jesus Christ.  We love Philly.  Let's go to...  Yeah.  Let's go to William in Miami.  William, what's up?  Hello, guys.  Hello, Bill.  What's up?  Well, I was going to say, I'm part Seminole, and I'm down here in Florida.  And a lot of it has to do with pride.  We're actually proud to have these teams have our heritage as their symbol.  It's nothing slanderous or offensive.  No, you're not.  Hey, let's...  Oh, really?  We are.  Yeah.  Good for you.  Let's figure out...  If it's Chief Nakahomo from Atlanta. 
[03:49:00]  I hate him.  Well, how about the mascot for the Indians?  It's Chief Wahoo.  Wahoo.  That's his name.  Chief Wahoo.  And it's that big, round face.  Yeah.  Wahoo.  Wahoo.  That's good.  That's good culture.  Chief Wahoo.  All right.  Before we get off the air today, we've got to figure out the worst mascot.  Because someone...  Good old Freddy.  Fast Freddy from Jamaica Station.  I forgot about this.  And I think we were up there when they debuted this.  The Red Sox mascot is awful. 
[03:49:30]  What is it?  Oh, that thing was stupid.  It's a green monster.  The green monster.  The green monster.  And his name is...  I forgot now.  Where are you?  Should be a shot pregnant.  Wally.  A shot pregnant.  Wally?  Wally.  He couldn't find a...  Just for the name alone, he should be fired.  Wally.  That is no thought process.  The green monster.  I remember when they debuted him, the whole place just started booing.  Like, what are you doing to our city?  Ladies and gentlemen, introducing the new Boston Red Sox mascot.  It's Wally, the green monster. 
[03:50:00]  And you just heard...  Boo!  Go fuck yourself, you cock sucker!  Who the fuck is Wally?  You fucking queer!  You fucking queer, Wally!  Go fuck Wally, your mother, your fucking mother!  Hey, Sully, Wally's a queer!  Sully, I'm gonna lob this fucking bottle at the fucking monster's head, you want?  And they should have.  That's no thought process behind that thing.  And Jim from Philly...  A wall.  Jim from Philly writes, 
[03:50:30]  Opie, we didn't throw batteries at Santa, we threw snowballs at Santa.  We threw batteries at J.D. Drew.  J.D. Drew.  That's right.  Who was that?  Baseball player.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He was a baseball player for us.  And let's not forget the standing ovation after What's-His-Name was paralyzed.  Michael Irvin.  Michael Irvin.  Oh, shit.  Fucking brutal, man.  That's what gives Philly its fabric, its texture.  Yeah.  You just love the hair stuff like that from cities.  Just mean people.  God damn.  Why don't you love that?  You have to love it.  I'm from Philly.  I've suffered all racism, all this race riots, and I still love it. 
[03:51:00]  I just love Philly.  They're out of their fucking mind.  All right, let's go to...  They certainly are.  Adam's gonna piss off a little Jimmy today.  Adam in Virginia.  Go ahead.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I got a couple of them for you.  First off, the Atlanta Braves have Tommy Hawk and Homer D. Braves.  Homer D. Braves.  How about the other one?  Maybe it could be a white guy and a mustache. 
[03:51:30]  Husband of the communist cunt.  How about fucking Ted Turner throws that one in there?  And then the other one is the University of Georgia Bulldogs.  They have hairy dog.  Hairy dog.  Oh, like hairy, hairy dog.  But it's just...  Maybe you can have like an ultimate fighting mascot competition.  Have the last mascot standing.  Just a bloody mascot just bashing.  You can give them weapons.  You know, Wahoo have his little...  Tomahawk.  Yeah, they have to have what they're equipped with. 
[03:52:00]  What, the Philly Fnatic gonna like tongue people to death with that stupid fucking party-favored tongue that sticks out?  Oh, dude, I want to smack him.  When he came into the studio when we were at YSP...  Oh, he smelled.  He smelled bad.  And he smelled so...  They gotta figure out how to wash those mascot fucking uniforms.  And he's inside it.  You don't see...  You just see the dopey face of the Fnatic.  And we're like, oh, fuck, that stinks.  And he's like, look, guy, I don't get to fucking wash this thing.  It's so funny.  You don't have a way to wash these mascot outfits. 
[03:52:30]  Look at the Philly Fnatic.  You turn around.  No, that's the green monster.  Let me see.  Ew!  It looks like fucking Mayor Menino with a green head.  Big, fat fucking head.  That's what the mascot should have been.  A big, oversized tongue in a mayor's mouth.  Mascots fucking suck.  They don't help anything.  No, they don't fucking get anybody riled.  Oh, the mascot's getting us to cheer.  Look, he's standing on the dugout.  No one fucking listens to them.  The mascot is fucking passe.  When guys wear fucking suits to baseball games, that's what a mascot was appropriate. 
[03:53:00]  They're shit.  Look at the mascot, dear.  How about another lucky strike?  I really fucking hate them.  Because they're not cute and they're not fun.  They don't do anything.  They're fucking embarrassing.  Look, a Negro's up to bat.  Let's go to something you don't see.  Derek in Jersey.  Look at his fucking, he has a fucking tampon nose.  The Philly Fanatic.  He only has, it's a fuck sleeve.  His nose is a bookstore fuck sleeve.  Hey, fuck sleeve nose. 
[03:53:30]  I hate the Philly Fanatic.  Why do you hate the Philly Fanatic?  Because you can hold his.  It looks bad.  It looks like a toilet paper.  You could fuck his nose.  A big hole in his nose.  The 76ers had Big Shot.  I think they got rid of him.  That was his name, Big Shot.  Big Shot.  Yeah, but they booed him.  Hey, let's go to Derek in Jersey.  Derek, try to jump in here, Derek.  Good morning, fellas.  That's the Philly Fanatic's nose.  You know what that's used?  For jacking off.  He was that for jacking off.  All right, fellas.  The Philadelphia Phillies were the last National League baseball team 
[03:54:00]  to sign a black player 10 years after Jackie Robinson.  Jackie Robinson was quoted as saying he considered Philadelphia  a city from the deep south.  Oh, shit.  Even beating out Boston?  I told you, Philly really is the worst.  I love it.  It's the worst.  One other thing about Philly, they're the only city ever to drop a satchel charge  from a helicopter on intimate housing to get the residents out.  It was called the Move.  The Move, yeah. 
[03:54:30]  When Move was squatting in buildings, it was an organization called Move,  and they were squatting in these buildings, and they tried to get them out.  How much they tried, I don't quite remember.  It was like this.  Hey, guys, you want to leave now?  All right.  Bomb them.  Yeah, and they dropped a satchel charge from a helicopter,  and it was just supposed to...  An incendiary.  What a good incendiary device.  It was just supposed to, like, make a loud explosion  and kind of tell them, get the fuck out. 
[03:55:00]  But they dropped an incendiary device on the roof  and burnt the whole fucking block down,  and it killed a bunch of people and injured a bunch,  and kids were running out.  Oh, it was a mess.  That's Philadelphia.  John Wildwood, the Philadelphia 76ers have a mascot called Hip Hop,  voted the worst mascot,  and when Barry Bonds came to Philly,  the fans threw prescription medicine bottles at him.  That's smart to throw.  Somebody with your name on it. 
[03:55:30]  Here's my name, address.  What's wrong with me?  What I'm taking.  Some of the illegal shit that I'm taking.  Someone's pissed off.  That guy's full of shit.  The Red Sox were the last team to sign a black guy,  and they could have been the first.  That makes more sense, the Red Sox.  Lou Mays and others tried out at Fenway before Jackie broke in  and somebody yelled, get those ends off the field.  Those ends.  Someone.  Fucking Boston, man.  Phone's lit.  We'll talk about mascots and other things. 
[03:56:00]  I got to take a leak, man.  Ooh.  What happened?  A little leaky.  What happened?  Pumpsy Green.  Can you tell me?  Pumpsy Green?  We got some info here.  What there?  It's taking a little while to download here,  but the blurb I saw was Pumpsy Green was the last first black baseball player.  I want to know the first black mascot.  That's what I want to know.  Who was the first sports black mascot?  Who has that one?  What is that?  I'm sure it's some team that doesn't exist anymore. 
[03:56:30]  Some awful racist name.  Down south.  I'm the Negro League.  All right.  Pirates mascot is Oliver Onion.  Is that true?  Travis has something.  It's a big pair of balls that are sweaty.  Yeah.  Another Braves mascot that was around the same time as Chief Nakahoma.  Yeah.  Was his counterpart, Princess Winnalata. 
[03:57:00]  Wow.  Stop it.  Swear.  Winnalata.  Fuck him.  What corn balls?  Oh.  What the fuck?  Who's enjoying that?  They just didn't care.  That just shows you they didn't care about that.  They just showed the mascots what they really were.  And now Princess Winnalata.  My favorite part when she comes out.  She gets you all riled up.  I love how Philly's helping us along here.  Instead of like going, come on, guys.  It's not that bad down here.  They're like, no.  They want to defend how awful it is.  Matt and Philly. 
[03:57:30]  Remember, Philly has a holding cell in a courtroom in their football stadium.  Courtroom.  They do that, man.  That's great.  Trials are being held down and people are being executed.  It's brutal.  It's always a good fist fight.  Someone's rolled out getting a lethal injection.  I'm doing something in the stands.  That's great.  The Colorado Rockies have dinger, which is a word for a home run.  Yeah.  A purple triceratops-like figure.  Aw, a little dinosaur. 
[03:58:00]  Why?  Colorado.  The fucking mascot should be in a trench coat.  How perfect would that be?  Fucking a trench coat with a shotgun and one glove?  Cap dancing?  Or a guy holding a garret in a little cowboy hat?  One little patent leather buckled shoe?  Oh, no.  A little cowboy hat.  I love the little cowboy hat.  Hey, getting a communique from Mike at fmqb.com. 
[03:58:30]  Talking about mascots?  No, just mascots.  There was Bonnie Brewer.  Let's not forget Bonnie Brewer.  Bonnie Brewer.  The Milwaukee Brewers.  They had her sweep the bases during the seventh inning with a brewer.  I like that.  That's good.  That's good.  She would be Tanya toilet.  She would have done a little toilet scrubbing in the outfield.  And then you got Bernie Brewer.  Milwaukee Brewers.  Used to slide into a big beer mug, but they eliminated the beer mug when they built a new stadium. 
[03:59:00]  Wait, he would slide into a big beer mug?  Oh, how fucking lame.  Hey, he was just trying to get a little head.  Come on.  Oh, there you go.  Mwak, mwak, mwak, mwak, mwak.  All right.  All right.  You don't feed beer.  Syracuse Orangeman.  Now just the Orange.  Oh, yeah.  It used to be the Orangeman.  Now they're just called the Orange.  Why?  Because...  What were Orangemen?  Orangemen were Indians.  Orangemen.  They were redskins.  I never heard Orangeman.  I'm going to explain.  All right.  Orangeman was a tribute to a Dutch aristocrat that halted the spread of Catholicism in Europe. 
[03:59:30]  Of course, now we get Otto the Orange as the mascot.  Otto the Orange?  What?  So what happened?  Like, what was offensive about Orange?  Man.  Yeah, I'd like to know that, too.  I don't know.  Jesus.  Hi, this is Chris Cornell, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  All right.  Let me unzip.  The New York Comedy Festival was for the last week here in New York City, of course. 
[04:00:00]  A lot of great shows all over the ball field.  And Patrice O'Neill and Louis C.K. are in the...  I was going to say they're in a little bit of trouble, but that is so stupid.  This is what you want as a comedian.  They got some fine press in the New York Post over the weekend.  If this bitch liked this, there'd be trouble.  Believe me.  You're right.  And this is, again, if you just write out small bits that people do during their act, 
[04:00:30]  taken out of context, it looks bad to a lot of people.  To me, I find it hysterical.  It's happened to us over the years with articles and magazines and stuff.  That could be a good bit one day to get our stuff.  Maybe the listeners can help us out and find those quotes that we've done in print in the newspapers and the magazines and send them in.  And then you read it out of context and they sound ridiculous and sound like Anthony really is a Nazi.  Yeah, exactly.  These sound funny, though.  These sound really funny.  Yeah, they sound funny, but not to her reading audience. 
[04:01:00]  Like these women would read this and be like, oh, oh, my God, that's horrible.  These hens wouldn't enjoy it under any circumstances.  Well, they're broads.  Broads don't enjoy lines like that.  Well, this column was written by Andrea Peiser, and she's got an open invite to call our show.  We'd love to get her angle on this.  Come on.  And we'll treat her with respect.  We'll beat her up with intelligence is what we'll do.  The comedy show was supposed to raise money for homeless women.  This is not funny. 
[04:01:30]  That's how it starts.  Right.  This is not funny.  But one comedian starring in the event Wednesday night thought it would be a riot to joke about maiming, killing, and doing a number one.  On his bitch.  On his bitch.  Thumbs up on that, E-Rock, because we've got to get this.  All right.  Yeah, stay in the close.  Yeah.  Maiming killing you.  Close contact with Al Duke. 
[04:02:00]  On his bitch.  And only bitch is in quotation marks.  Another thought it was a.  What's that, E-Rock?  So you're waving your hand around.  What?  It got dumped?  All right.  Why?  Well, you back up.  All right.  Let's start over.  Because this is an article that appeared in the New York Post.  We should be able to read this word for word.  This is funny.  Let's try to get by the dump.  Yes.  That's what we're doing today.  Hold on.  Let's start over.  But one comedian.  No, no.  I would start all over.  I don't know how far back he went.  The comedy show is supposed to raise money for homeless women. 
[04:02:30]  This is not funny.  All right.  We know that's it.  Okay, good.  But one comedian starring in the event Wednesday night thought it would be a riot to joke about  maiming, killing, and treating a picture dog, fire hydrant.  No.  Why?  Well, as soon as we say the next line, right?  Okay.  Well, well, it's the, yeah, it's that, that's the problem. 
[04:03:00]  Here it is.  Here it is.  One comedian starring in the event Wednesday night thought it would be a riot to joke  about maiming, killing, and degrading in a certain liquid manner on his bitch at that  work.  No way.  Absolutely.  Let's watch.  No way.  Why not?  What?  That went through.  Absolutely.  Wow, Ant, you're good.  That's exactly what you're saying.  Ant is good. 
[04:03:30]  I say screw the FCC.  Skated.  He learns.  Skated.  I say screw it, and he learns.  Nice.  All right.  I ought to show them fuckers.  Oh, damn it.  Oops.  One for the XMers.  Sorry.  Oops.  Sorry, boys and girls.  All right.  I threw one out just for the fun of it.  We treated the XMers to occur.  Yeah, treat yourselves. 
[04:04:00]  Treat yourself to occur.  They earned that profanity.  Oh, no.  Rumor has it we're going to find Andrew today.  No way.  They found him.  Someone came up to me on Friday and said they found Andrew, the guy, you know, the homeless  guy.  I stomped on his cake, blah, blah, blah.  It's on YouTube.  And someone found him on Friday, and supposedly he's going to be part of the walkover today  for the first time.  Oh, that'd be nice to see him again.  Because we're trying to get him for the homeless shopping spree.  We'll have info on that.  He'll be so happy to be giving money, a trip to a mall. 
[04:04:30]  Yeah.  All the listeners will help him out.  All right.  Back to the article.  No way.  Yeah.  All right.  We got through that line.  Another thought it was a blast to another thought it would be a blast.  Yes.  To kid about smashing the skull of his toddler daughter.  Yeah.  Another thought it would be a blast to kid about smashing the skull of his toddler daughter.  Gee, I wonder who that was.  Of course, it's funny to kid about that.  Yeah. 
[04:05:00]  And out of context, it sounds horrific.  But in the context of Louie's act about how miserable he is having to even communicate  with his daughter, and he's a man, and then you're put in this situation where you've  got to deal with the psycho babble ramblings of a small child.  Any parent doesn't get this little thought by their head that they would want to smash  the kid's head in.  And that's the context that it's in.  Basically, it's the famous OJ line.  You wouldn't do it, but you understand. 
[04:05:30]  But I understand.  You get these moments.  The raunch fest called Comedy Cares for the Homeless.  Took off at Town Hall in Midtown.  Headlined by funny woman Paula Poundstone and Caroline Ray.  Both of them.  Paula Poundstone.  Paula Poundstone.  How about that's more offensive, having her host this event.  No kidding.  For a woman.  Why do you think women end up in some homeless shelters? 
[04:06:00]  Perhaps something happened when they were younger and they weren't able to get their life  back together because some manly looking woman in a suit touched them inappropriately?  Christ, Paula Poundstone.  Yeah, that really wasn't an abysmal thing she allegedly did or never did.  You know, Paula, why'd you do that?  Well, best part was no hair to have to spit out.  Yeah, hosted by a funny woman, funny women, Paula Poundstone and Caroline Ray. 
[04:06:30]  Caroline Ray, really fast.  The host of The Biggest Loser.  Yeah.  As the contestants continue to lose weight week after week.  It's one of the few shows I watch.  She's getting fatter.  Is she?  She's hosting Biggest Loser and the contestants are losing weight like crazy around her.  And she's the one that is the host of the show.  That'd be a good gimmick for the host to have to be on the show the next season.  Absolutely.  Because she got too fat.  She should be a contestant. 
[04:07:00]  All right, go ahead.  More Andrea Pizer review here from The Post.  But after suffering through the show, one major donor, get this now, get this bull, this hypocrisy.  After suffering through the show, one major donor immediately yanked her support from Care for the Homeless,  which is now building a Bronx shelter for women. 
[04:07:30]  Many of them victims of domestic violence.  So one major donor didn't like the show and yanked support for the actual program.  Oh, is that great?  Isn't that good?  Because of something two comedians says, one woman, someone's going to get a black eye for her husband.  Right, and have nowhere to go.  How great is that?  Because somebody made a joke that this idiot didn't like.  Because she, yeah, because she put her personal preferences above the cause. 
[04:08:00]  What a pig.  Like, obviously she doesn't really believe in the cause if she is going to pull out her support over a dumb joke.  Yeah.  What a pig trying to bully everybody because she gives money to help the people of domestic violence,  the victims of domestic violence, not to dictate how the money is earned other places, you pig.  Wouldn't you, aside from it being illegal sources, wouldn't you not really care how you're getting the money 
[04:08:30]  as long as the money is getting there to the women that need it?  Mm-hmm.  Especially if it's a comedy festival.  Jesus Christ, how innocent is that?  And we've talked about this over the years.  We won't retell the story again, but it just amazes us that these charities have, like, will not accept money.  Yeah.  You would think every charity would accept money no matter where it's coming from.  Mm-hmm.  Even if it's coming from Mark Carr's personal checkbook, you would accept it because it's helping somebody. 
[04:09:00]  But no, they got, stupid me, they got morals.  They got morals to the point that they won't accept the money so people will suffer because they didn't take this money from this questionable source.  Where do you read the next one?  This is a gem.  Yeah, this is great.  It's open season on women.  Wait, did you do the, oh, okay, all right, sorry, go ahead.  Said an angry Merle Hoffman.  How old is Merle?  Oh, he must have been angry.  Merle, president of Choices Women's Clinic, who removed her support. 
[04:09:30]  Oh, Merle is a woman?  What a hot chick.  Wow.  A woman named Merle must be.  Let me get in the mood.  Hold on.  Let me see if this would work at all.  Oh, Merle.  Oh, yeah, Merle.  Yeah, Merle.  Ugh.  That's right, let me grab your mullet.  Yeah.  Your Converse sneakers.  You look so hot, Merle.  Merle.  Merle.  And she's the president of a Choices Women's Clinic, but she doesn't like violence against 
[04:10:00]  women jokes.  Yeah.  Well, what do you do when a woman comes in and wants an abortion and it's a little girl?  Wouldn't you kind of consider that violence against a female?  Don't punch them, but it's okay to vacuum them.  That's okay, yeah.  You self-righteous bitch.  Shut your face.  Absolutely.  God almighty.  Shut up.  God bless Louis C.K.  and Patrice O'Neal for not adjusting their sets, by the way.  Yeah.  All right.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Talk about taking your young daughter and smashing her head in.  But, uh...  Hey, at least he gave birth to the kid. 
[04:10:30]  Yeah.  At least they had the kid, Merle.  They didn't traipse him to the clinic and look for the Hoover.  Don't worry about that little piece banging on the edge of the dumpster behind the place.  Jesus.  That's right.  As you're dumping out stew that could have cured cancer.  Wow.  We'll never know.  We'll never know.  Oh, Merle.  Merle Hoffman, who removed her support.  That's what really infuriates me. 
[04:11:00]  Misogyny is the last permissible thing.  Is it?  No.  You dope with a man's name?  Misogyny is the last permissible thing?  How come everybody that feels victimized says that they are the last thing that's allowed  to make fun of?  There's still gay bashing and racism to enjoy.  What's the matter with you?  You dumb broads are third by a long shot.  Merle.  I say blacks, gays, Jews. 
[04:11:30]  And then women.  And then women.  What are they doing at a comedy show?  You're fourth.  You dope.  That's right.  Merle.  Merle.  What are they doing at a comedy show?  Don't people realize by now that for every laugh that is had at a comedy show, it kind  of hurt somebody out there.  Maybe not someone.  Not Paula Poundstone or Carolyn Ray.  That's what these women wanted.  Maybe not.  They probably howled at those two.  Yeah, but I'm sure they told jokes.  If you really broke down their set, it was hurting somebody. 
[04:12:00]  Maybe not in the audience, but hurting somebody out there.  That's what comedy is all about.  Yeah.  Also in the audience were-  Oh, these are more wonderful names coming up.  An unamused Sonia Osorio, president of the city's National Organization for Women, and  Liz Abzug.  How is your last name Abzug?  Abzug.  How do you not have a sense of humor with the last name Abzug?  Is that Bella Abzug's daughter or something? 
[04:12:30]  Probably.  Abzug, that's the sound a guy's fist makes when it hits your stomach.  Abzug.  Ab-  What sexy, sexy names for, I'm sure, sexy, sexy women.  We've got a couple women screaming at us, it's not Merle, it's Merly.  It's not Merly.  It's not Merly, you dumb broad.  It's Merle.  It's Merle.  M-E-A-R-L-Y would be Merly.  Okay.  Like it's the Merly show, or I have to get up Merly tomorrow. 
[04:13:00]  Merly.  It's not Merle.  It's not Merle, you dumb Stephanie bitch.  Stephanie, you're in violation.  You stupid broad.  You're in violation.  It's Merle, not Merle.  You're in violation, Stephanie.  M-E-R-L-E.  M-E-R-L-E.  That spells Merle.  That's Merle, not Merle.  Stephanie.  You're dope.  Stephanie.  We know how to read, Stephanie.  Stephanie, speak.  Hey, Stephanie.  Speak. 
[04:13:30]  It's Merle.  We love you too, Stephanie.  Why do you think it's Merle?  Well, I didn't.  I don't have this.  No.  Oh, it's Merle.  God.  Merle.  Merle.  Shut up.  All right.  You know what?  I wish she didn't get up so Merle and didn't listen to this show.  We got to do the second.  Hold on.  I won't.  Let myself go.  We got to do the second half of the column after the break.  No.  But we'll tease you with this.  Now, I like to think I have a seriously twisted sense of humor. 
[04:14:00]  They always say that.  But.  Yeah.  Dot, dot, dot after the break.  They always say that.  They all say that.  You know, now I'm known as the gal that, oh, hoo, hoo, hoo.  I'm no prude.  Oh, I'm not me.  I have a seriously twisted sense of humor.  No, you don't.  When that comedian talks about the peanuts on the plane, I'm right with them.  I understand and I laugh.  When has Andrea Peiser ever displayed anything that resembled a seriously twisted sense of humor? 
[04:14:30]  Never.  I mean, bashing your daughter with a rock.  That's seriously twisted humor.  That's seriously twisted.  What do you think that's funny, Andrea, that would classify you as having a seriously twisted sense of humor?  Black jokes.  She couldn't enjoy them.  Well, we'll see what she thought wasn't funny whatsoever.  I'd love to talk to her.  And it has something to do with Patrice O'Neill.  Of course it does.  It's the worst.  Worst.  Of the O.P. and Anthony show.  We're in the middle of talking about Andrea Peiser's column in the New York Post Saturday. 
[04:15:00]  Entitled No Laughing Matter.  No Laughing Matter.  That's what you want when you're a comic being pretty much reviewed by this woman who has no credentials in reviewing a comedy act.  Oh, Jesus.  I love the pictures for you.  Oh, my God.  We finally got a look at the pictures.  I told you it makes you look like if you was writing a scathing report on something.  They found a picture that I've never even seen myself that looks exactly like it should look for a bad article. 
[04:15:30]  These are pictures of men.  And, yeah, you and Louie's picture look like men that would just beat their women senselessly.  Look at the picture they have of Louie like he's a raven, sweaty lunatic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you've never looked like this in your life.  I guarantee you this was a joke pose you did for somebody.  For somebody.  Because you got your head back, tilted to the side, all attitude.  This is just when – here's Patrice's picture.  Just when the woman is coming to again after you just knocked her out, she's looking up. 
[04:16:00]  And this is the face you're giving her like, bitch, I've hit you harder than that.  And you didn't go down.  And don't let me cut that index finger off so you don't down 9-1-1.  Like, that's what a face – that's what my face looks like.  Yeah, that's what your face looks like.  Let me do that on purpose.  Let me do the real – let me do the quick recap here.  So Patrice was part of this comedy thing with Louie C.K.  The raunch fest called Comedy Cares for the Homeless took off at Town Hall in Midtown,  headlined by funny woman Paula Poundstone and Carolyn Ray. 
[04:16:30]  But after suffering through the show, one major donor immediately yanked her support from Care for the Homeless,  which is now building a Bronx shelter for women.  Many of them victims of domestic violence.  So she's like, I'm out.  I'm out.  I'm not helping black guys anymore.  And that woman was Merle Hoffman.  Merle Hoffman.  Merle.  A woman named Merle.  What the other – did you get the other –  Hold on.  Yeah, we're getting there.  It's open season on women, said an angry Merle Hoffman, president of Choices Women's Clinic,  who removed her support. 
[04:17:00]  That's what really –  And a lot of fetuses.  Said Merle Hoffman as she tweezered a hair up in between her teeth.  Some – Merle.  Merle.  Merle.  Hey, beautiful.  What's your name?  Merle.  Merle.  What's his name?  Bob.  Also in the audience, we're an unamused Sonia Osario, president of the city's National Organization  for Women, and Liz Abzug.  Liz Abzug. 
[04:17:30]  Abzug.  I'm so sorry you have Liz Abzug.  There's a –  I do.  How long do I have to live?  How do you have a B, a Z, and a G in the same five-letter last name?  She should be shot.  It's just how – how do you spell the most unsexy name in the world?  Merle.  Merle, Abzug, or Merle.  Well, Merle, Abzug would be the winner.  Merle Hoffman's a guy you borrow hedge clippers from.  It's not a frigging woman's name. 
[04:18:00]  Unless it's Merle.  No.  No.  M-E-R-L-E is Merle.  No, Stephanie.  Well, I thought – I thought maybe she spelled – you know how sometimes girls will spell  their name?  It'll be Jill, but they spell it like J-Y-L-L-E-X.  There is no way this is Merle because it's M-E-R-L-E.  It's Merle.  It's Merle.  How about Merle?  Her name is Merle.  How about Merle?  No.  Merle.  I still say it's not Merle.  It's Merle.  She wears tight dungarees and work boots.  Her name is Merle.  Of course she does. 
[04:18:30]  She walks around with a pocket gazoo and a ukulele with a strap on it around her neck.  She has hair like Joe Dirt.  Merle stinks.  I hate Merle.  I hate Merle, too.  I hope Merle gets abzug on her – I was going to say –  Osorio?  You have abzugs.  There's abzugs on your ovaries.  We're sorry.  The picture they had – yeah, the Osorio girl is the –  Let me see. 
[04:19:00]  Let me see what she looks like.  She's kind of the hottest for somebody who's like –  It's not totally bad for what she does.  She's kind of cute for me.  But she's the president of now right now?  What a wonderful sense of humor she must have.  I bet.  All she deals with is bleeding gums and, you know –  Black eyes.  And bad excuses on why they didn't get their housework done.  I was – I was – I was – I was cleaning and he was drinking. 
[04:19:30]  Yeah, all right, fine.  But why don't you explain why dinner was cold again?  How about that, toots?  Don't give Sonya one side of the story.  I like putting her picture with – I like putting her picture right next to Louie's and yours, Patrice.  It really fills out the whole thing.  Wait a minute.  That's – no, put hers to the left of me.  And I'm in the middle.  And that's the caption.  Oh, okay.  And –  There it is.  Just like that.  Yeah.  That's how it went.  Oh, wow.  Okay, that's bad. 
[04:20:00]  Wow.  That's not good.  It looks like you two were indicted for raping her.  Right.  That's exactly what it looks like.  Wait, but do you know the original paper, it takes up half the top of the paper.  The next article was Nazi riot at a Jewish wedding.  Was – Nazi riot at a Jewish wedding was the next –  The next story to read after –  Did it also say no laughing matter?  After your filth.  No, Nazi riot was a laugh reference.  Nazi riot was a bunch of – like a laugh riot.  And I tell you what, I want to see Sonia Osario's desk. 
[04:20:30]  She just has tissue box after tissue box.  For all the snivelers that walk in.  Got a refrigerator with raw steaks in it for their eyes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  You know it's the organization's logo on the side of the tissue boxes.  Oh, yeah.  Because everyone likes the merchandise.  Oh, dude.  I don't know.  And they didn't tell us it was a beating – it was a beating of homeless women. 
[04:21:00]  How great is that?  How great is that?  You're backstage getting ready for your set.  You've done a million times, and you have no clue that there's, like, people in the audience that have been beat silly.  And I told you, Louis, the same thing you do.  You know, Norton, you do what you're doing at the time.  That's it.  Nolan told you?  Not that you would have changed your act because we know you.  Not that you should.  Yeah, of course.  Of course not.  It was a regular – I thought we thought it was – we thought it was just all regular  homelessness.  Not the beat-up one.  Especially beating women.  Beat-up women.  You know, it changed my whole thing. 
[04:21:30]  The article gets much better.  Not only is now National Organization of Women, but it's when you should do the housework when  you're told.  Oh, my God.  They had a problem with our Whip Him Out Wednesday promotion.  Of course they did.  We had our run-ins with them.  Yeah, she's the president of the New York chapter of now.  Of now?  Of now.  How much fun could she be?  It was so – you don't understand, man.  How – it was so non-climactic.  It was anti-climactic for this situation. 
[04:22:00]  I just came in, did my abusive humor, and left.  Went to a party.  Can I ask you something?  Were you getting good reactions from the crowd?  Of course.  You were killing, right?  Of course.  So you were killing, and stupid Andrea Pizer was in the audience.  She didn't like what you were saying, probably because maybe it hits too close to home,  I'm thinking.  And all of a sudden, she has to write a whole column on it.  So you weren't getting booed off the stage or nothing?  There was one lady that could have been Andrea that were yelling out,  Excuse me.  She did not. 
[04:22:30]  Somebody.  I don't know who.  Ew.  Excuse me.  And I've heard that excuse me before because, of course, I've pissed women off enough to go,  Excuse me.  She was going to say something like,  Do you have a girlfriend?  Has your mother ever –  Oh.  I was like this.  I was in the middle of doing –  Oh, you heard her, and you stopped your set?  I said like this.  I said, let me just finish this one here, and I'll get to your question.  Because she was very deliberate.  She had a very –  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  I'm empowered, and I – 
[04:23:00]  You should not go to a comedy show.  Don't.  It's as simple as that.  Wait a minute.  I go like this, which I know had to piss whoever it was off.  I go, hold on.  I finished the joke, and then I go, oh, they said I got to go.  Like, they said I have to go.  Thank you very much.  I got to go.  Good night.  And she said –  Not addressing you, you dope.  She should be that zealous when she's dropping those little blue hockey pucks into the septic tank.  That's when she should have that type of – that type of go-get-em attitude.  When there's a streak in the tub, get that – that go-getter attitude. 
[04:23:30]  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  There's a streak in this tub, and I better get to cleaning.  Oh, didn't I say scrambled?  Oh, I thought you said sunny side –  Excuse me.  It's not your problem.  They picked the comedians for this benefit.  Yeah.  Do their research.  Do their research, right.  Yeah, go get some boring, safe comics if you're going to be offended so easily.  On my best day, I'm still marginally – like, on my least offensive day, somebody can complain about – 
[04:24:00]  It's a rumor.  All right, let's move on with the article because it gets really good.  Yeah, we're going to have to do a little tiptoeing around this one, too.  Now –  She starts off this one paragraph.  This is Andrea Pizer.  Now, I like to think I have a seriously twisted sense of humor.  You don't.  I would love to find out what she thinks is twisted.  You don't.  And funny.  But did you read the part with –  Oh, you couldn't read it.  Yeah, we're getting there.  We're getting there.  No, no, no.  We'll get there.  Oh, yeah.  When they said maim and –  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Maiming, killing, and we couldn't say the other thing on the radio. 
[04:24:30]  That's seriously twisted.  How could she not find that funny?  Right.  That's not –  She didn't even say a twisted sense of humor.  She said seriously twisted.  And she likes to think that about herself.  You know what?  Oh, honey, I can go with the best of it.  I bet it.  Her little coffee clotches she goes to with all her little old maid women sitting there.  She is the life of the party with her jokes.  You know what it is?  They're probably all around her dumb broad friends, and they play cards, and they watch  soaps, and someone says something about having too many drinks, and she goes, oh, oh, I 
[04:25:00]  had too many drinks once.  It was crazy.  Let me tell you.  And that's twisted and seriously crazy.  And twisted and crazy.  Oh, jeez.  You're not twisted.  Your sense of humor stinks.  It's not.  And if Andrea Pizer was the one saying, excuse me, call our show.  Call our show.  We'll let you have the air and see what you're all about.  You'll have free reign of our airwaves to explain yourself.  Now, I like to think I have a seriously twisted sense of humor, but I was among those who  felt ill.  But you're telling us that not many people were complaining, right?  You were getting huge laughs. 
[04:25:30]  Whatever.  Among those who felt ill when I heard comic Patrice O'Neill.  He's a guy.  He's a guy.  They had to put that.  Heard comic Patrice O'Neill instruct men on how to turn a lover into a pirate.  How great is that?  And we have to stop there because the FCC has a major problem with all these stupid things.  Yeah, but there's a way to do this.  But the fact that she wrote it, that you're reading what she wrote, it's amazing.  That's why the FCC stinks on ice. 
[04:26:00]  It's doing something in the heat of passion that will end up with the woman having to have  one of her eyes shut real quickly, like getting something in her eye so it'll shut.  And that is supposed to represent the patch over the eye.  Oh, you're pushing?  Yeah, you're slimmer in the face with your fist.  And that's supposed to represent the patch being over the eye.  And then it says, then kicking her leg until she says, and it's spelt out in quotations,  ARG! 
[04:26:30]  This is why when I was reading it, I thought that she was not trying to make a bad article.  Because why would she write ARG?  Why would you write it?  The joke is, it reads funny.  It reads funny.  She's so stupid for doing that.  Like, you don't put ARG, and then that might have, but she put ARG.  But hey, she's showing she's got a twist that says in humor.  No, she's so stupid.  No kidding. 
[04:27:00]  Why would she do that?  Because as a dumb woman, she doesn't understand that that's as funny as it is.  So she writes it out and thinks that's terrible.  And Merle agrees.  And so does Abzug.  Liz Abzug.  And so does that other pie eater.  And Sonia Osario.  And then it says, Sonia Osario.  That's what you should have said when you didn't give the eggs right to your husband.  I'm Osario. 
[04:27:30]  Osario.  Osario.  Lightheaded.  Osario.  Yeah, if you said your last name a few times, maybe you would have saved a few black eyes.  He also drew laughs and gasps.  You drew gasps by teaching men to improve the pinnacle of pleasure, let's say, by paralyzing partners during the act.  Which is, which was the donkey punch. 
[04:28:00]  Can you?  Yeah, just say that.  I'm telling you, FCC has find people like crazy over all that.  You can't really describe it.  All those terms are like such a no-no on radio.  And she's making this like, this is my creation.  Right.  I'm like, I'm just going through it.  Like, what is she, she, she made it to be some type of, she validated that nonsense.  Yep.  Yeah.  Absolutely did.  And then she goes way overboard as far as I'm concerned.  Oh, yes. 
[04:28:30]  Then Louis C.K., who's HBO series Lucky Louis, was mercifully canceled.  That's just out of order.  You know, why?  Why?  Why do you have to kick us all the way down?  Because she didn't like it, so she figured.  Of course, yeah.  I thought she had a twisted sense of humor.  What is she like that's twisted?  What does she, everything that I think is funny, she hates.  She's, she's ignorant, man.  I love this line.  I hate people like this because they think if they didn't like something that everyone  else should not like something.  I hate that more than anything. 
[04:29:00]  Now, this is a, this is a seriously twisted sense of humor.  If she had a seriously twisted sense of humor, she'd find this funny.  Right.  Then Louis C.K., who's HBO series Lucky Louis, mercifully canceled, one-upped his twisted  colleague, joking about decimating his stupid four-year-old daughter by bashing her in the  head.  And she goes, argh.  I love that.  She should have wrote argh.  I haven't seen the words argh since Batman.  Hey, hey, uh. 
[04:29:30]  It was on TV.  We have someone that was in the audience, Sheep Lover, who's listening on XM.  The girl who stood up yelling, excuse me, was not Andrea.  I saw the girl who did that.  And she was yelling, would you like that done to your mom or sister?  Of course.  Not only.  And then he writes, ha ha, Patrice killed.  He's the best.  The crowd loved it.  So for the most part, the crowd loved it, except for this bitch.  Too bad you didn't hear that because you could have answered yes, that you would love that  done to your girlfriend and mother.  And would pay to watch it, depending how much you'd spend on the ethnicity of the person 
[04:30:00]  doing it.  You could have written, I'll pay extra for an unclipped gentleman.  Oh, wow.  This is interesting.  The next paragraph.  Yeah.  Bobby Watts, executive director of Care for the Homeless, told me he had some complaints  about the show, though in a frantic email to Hoffman, Watts insisted that one of the  show's producers, Carolyn Thompson, was outraged by the material and let the comics have it  backstage.  I'm going to, in a way, I wanted to smash Bobby Watts, but he's the director of Care  for the Homeless, and she yanked money, so he kind of has to do that. 
[04:30:30]  I was going to say, I feel like I should be loyal to the guy, but they didn't say anything.  Well, screw them.  He's just trying to get hard.  And did someone, yeah, did anybody catch hell backstage?  Did you even...  Stop.  Could you imagine Patrice O'Neal standing there as somebody lambast him about his act?  You'd make that face.  That was in the paper.  That's where they'd get that picture.  It's just, I couldn't believe it was that political, watching this, like, reading, and 
[04:31:00]  I'm going, what?  I just did that stupidness and left.  Oh, poor Bobby Watts.  He then had to.  I want to state that I do not condone the offensive women-hating nature of the routines Watts wrote  to Hoffman.  I wonder if Merle got the email.  Did you write, dear Merle?  Was it dear Ms. Hoffman, or was it, hey, Merle?  Yeah, she got the email in between cooking tips.  Oh, because she was looking up on the Google. 
[04:31:30]  Merle flips up her flannel collar.  He said, Merle.  Merle.  Dear Merle.  Merle's got some emasculated man that cooks for her.  Dear Merle, LOL.  You don't even put a comma after Merle.  It's a colon.  Merle.  Another producer, Mark Krantz, disputed that anyone was upset.  He said the organizers knew very well what the comics might say. 
[04:32:00]  We're sorry if it offended, but the performers knew why they were there, and they were there  for free.  He didn't even get paid.  He said the event organizers walked into this with their eyes open.  I'm sure on some planet these comics are funny.  Get Andrea Pizer on the phone.  Andrea, don't hide.  Come on our show.  But for a woman's homeless shelter, that's a bad joke.  I'm sure on some planet these comics are funny.  What an ass. 
[04:32:30]  Just because you didn't like it, that's fine.  You have your own opinion.  I respect that, but to think that people don't think Patrice O'Neal's funny is ridiculous.  I don't know, man.  And Lucy Kaye.  According to Andrea, she has a seriously twisted sense of humor.  Seriously twisted.  I'll bet you her and Merle and the Abzug girl shared a few belly laughs backstage.  Remember that time you got pregnant and then you sneezed and you weren't pregnant anymore?  Bah!  I bet they chuckle watching that clear hose trying to identify what pieces are going through it. 
[04:33:00]  Look.  Was that a little hand?  I would have shaken that.  Bah!  Oh!  Oh, my sense of humor is so twisted I'm laughing.  Uh-oh.  Mess on the linoleum.  O.T.  Oh, well.  That could have been a president.  Oh, boy.  That's good.  Great.  Hey, what happened? 
[04:33:30]  From bassinet to biohazard bag.  We got more on the story from Patrice O'Neal.  I guess his fine woman there got into an email battle with Andrea Pizer.  Oh, what a trooper.  Good for her.  She ran in the house.  Good for your girl, man.  Her main thing was why would – she was upset mostly with Merle.  Merle.  Because it's like, why would you yank your money?  Yeah.  Because of what my boyfriend said. 
[04:34:00]  Yeah, that's worse than what you did.  Like the women don't need the money because you upset her.  I don't think you did anything wrong.  But if you're thinking about what's worse, I think what's worse is like pulling money  out of an organization that needs the help over a dumb joke.  I'm sorry.  I just got so distracted at what I think was the news.  It is the news.  No, it can't possibly be the news.  No, you're kidding.  It's white people dancing, and two of them are wearing the Jamaican hats.  They're wearing Jamaican hats with the fake dreads coming out.  Losing weight to reggae. 
[04:34:30]  And they're dancing behind the anchor desk.  Could you ever see Walter Cronkite with a reggae hat on and dreads?  How the hell could you lose weight to reggae?  Losing weight to reggae, yeah.  You're not losing weight to reggae.  You're smoking pot and sitting in a lounge chair next to a pool.  How the hell do you lose weight and freaking listening to reggae?  Smoking blunts.  Are you kidding?  Just stop it.  Look at these idiots. 
[04:35:00]  I could see you losing weight listening to Boy George music, but it's not reggae.  Oh, man.  Six months later.  There you go.  He's just lost all the weight you need.  I'm dumbfounded watching that.  Who's watching the news and actually laughing?  I don't know.  It's all right.  Anyway, so what happened with the chick?  And I have a severely twisted, seriously twisted sense of humor.  Oh, God.  I like to think I have a twisted sense of humor.  Let's get back to Patrice because I want to wrap this up so we can move on to other things.  Yeah, she wrote and she started it out.  I didn't read it because I know how I am.  If I read it, I would have been backseat driving her great. 
[04:35:30]  But I read it.  It was really good.  It began with, I am Patrice O'Neal's fiancee, and then in parentheses, a.k.a. his bitch.  And I'm here to say that I have never been maimed or beaten in the act of sex.  But she never defended that I'm a misogynist.  She never said I'm not one.  She probably tried to, and her computer wouldn't let her type it.  It kept deleting.  But she wrote a long thing and all the gripes.  And Andrea wrote back, I have to paraphrase, but she basically wrote back, listen, first of all, don't shoot the messages. 
[04:36:00]  Second of all, I am not a, before you give me a speech about journalistic integrity,  I am not a journalist.  I'm a columnist.  So they're paid for their opinions.  To me, it's fine.  She's got an opinion, but it's a lousy one.  It's one that is contradictory to her saying that she has a seriously twisted sense of humor.  And, you know, that's, that's. 
[04:36:30]  Do women like that have sex?  Gloria's all right.  Well, I'll bet you, I'll bet you, I'll bet you not only do they have sex, but I'll bet you that they like their hair pulled.  And I'll bet you that they are just dirtbag submissive.  That's what my guess would be.  Because any woman that's running around tooting her own horn like that and just demanding her, I guarantee you.  Like a lot, like a lot of these.  If they're straight, they're dirty subs.  A lot of these right wing guys that are against homosexuality always end up popping out of the closet when something happens. 
[04:37:00]  And some guy comes in and says, hey, we were having sex.  Same thing with these women.  Yeah, they probably in bed just love a little hair tug.  We have another person that was at the show.  Anna from Bayside.  As someone who attended the show, it's ironic that Twatty, Carolyn Ray and Paula Poundstone weren't lambasted for their tacky attempts at man bashing.  Oh, was Paula Poundstone and Carolyn Ray trying to?  I wasn't even going to ask Patrice that question.  She has no clue. 
[04:37:30]  I don't know.  He just waits for the first time going on stage.  I had no doubt in my mind.  You didn't see any part of the show.  I don't know what it is.  I guess that's okay because when a woman tries to hit you, you just laugh at her anyway.  Absolutely.  You just take a little slap and you just give it right back harder.  And then Anna continues.  Put a glass ring on her cheek.  Anna continues.  They just wish they got laughs like Patrice and Louis did.  Stupid.  And then she used the C plural word.  Yeah.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  She went there.  Comic kooks.  Comedians.  I can't believe by the...  Here's the Dorsen of Andrea Piser. 
[04:38:00]  She's a homely woman.  They're columnists like Linda Stacey.  Yeah.  And her.  They're all ugly.  None of them are sexy.  I don't know what Merle looks like, but she couldn't be ugly.  Merle can't be sexy.  How can she be?  Merle.  This is how we wrap this up.  Once again, we invite the columnists to defend themselves on the Opie and Anthony show.  It never happens.  I want to talk to Merle.  They all hide.  Let's get Merle.  We'll talk to Merle Hoffman.  We'll talk to Liz Asberg. 
[04:38:30]  Abzug.  Abzug.  Abzug.  We'll talk to the girl that has sorry in her last name.  Osario.  Oh, sorry.  Sonia Osario.  And the Piser woman.  And we'll talk to the Piser woman.  Do we try getting them all?  Merle?  All at once.  What happened?  Too early, right?  They all say that.  Oh, too early.  All right.  It's the only day virus spreading across America.  Patrice O'Neal, everyone.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I guess which is their best, really.  You know, when you think about it. 
[04:39:00]  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Did I just fart?  We have Louis C.K.  He's waiting on hold here.  Just listening to us babble about nothing.  Talky.  Hey, Louis.  What's up?  Hey, sweetie.  And the lack of interest in it.  Congrats on the print.  Oh, yeah.  That was some nice ink.  That was great.  We've been talking about it all morning.  We have Patrice O'Neal in studio.  Yeah, I was very proud of that.  I thought that was awesome. 
[04:39:30]  No laughing matter, my friend.  Well, you should know better than me.  I love how many, every time something happens with comedy, that's the headline.  Yep.  No laughing matter.  That's really creative.  But this woman claims to have this really, seriously twisted sense of humor.  Yeah.  And then just trashes you guys.  Yeah.  You know, I actually thought it was, she was fair in a lot of ways.  Like, she says that Patrice got laughs.  Like, she could have just not mentioned that.  Mm-hmm.  She does say he got laughs and gasps, which is true. 
[04:40:00]  I was there.  You know, there were people that were bumming out, but they were helping to make laughs,  the people with senses of humor.  That happens at the women's clinics, too.  Laughs and gasps.  Yeah.  The boyfriend's laughing and high-fiving his friends while she's gasping and thinking  he's still going to stay with her because she's going through what he promised he'd stay  with her if she went through.  Do you mean if I get it taken care of, you won't break up with me?  Yeah.  And he hears that thing get plugged in, and he hears the kickstart, and he high-fives 
[04:40:30]  his friends, and they leave her there.  Oh, my God.  Have some orange juice and get your own ride home, you no morning after pill whore.  I've just got to sell these concert tickets to pay for it.  Fast times, right on.  The one thing about Andrea Pizer that she fails to mention in the column, she, I mean,  the headline is No Laughing Matter, but Louis C.K. and Patrice O'Neill were getting  huge laughs at this show.  There was only a handful of people that weren't enjoying it.  Yeah, no, it was killing.  And the thing is that the point of having us there was not that we weren't supposed 
[04:41:00]  to be there to talk about how great women's shelters are.  Yeah.  We were there to put our names on the show so the people would come and see us.  And both Patrice and I, when we went on stage, got big applause going on, so we know that  people came, paid money to that women's shelter so that they could watch us say horrible things  about women.  That's the whole point.  Right.  You know, if they had had a show where a bunch of people stand up there and talk about how  nice everybody should be, nobody would have paid any money.  So, you know, this woman that pulled her support, though, that's what makes me sick. 
[04:41:30]  Yeah.  She thinks that she's helping.  She thinks that she's fighting misogyny by taking money away from a woman's shelter.  Yeah.  Well, you think if Merle Hoffman would have been billed that she was going to be up on stage  and Liz Abzug was going to be up there, that the place would have packed out?  Of course not.  The thing that's funny, too, is that Merle Hoffman, it says she pulled her support.  Yeah.  She's the president of Choices Women's Clinic.  Yeah.  It's not like they had money.  She just decided to be bitter and say something crappy. 
[04:42:00]  But it's not like she was pouring money into the place.  Oh, so she just is removing her support.  Well, that's the way I read it because it doesn't –  So, you know –  No, I think she was – actually, I think she said she was a big financial contributor.  Maybe on a personal level, she was.  It doesn't say that on the –  No, I thought it said she was a big contributor.  I could be wrong.  No, she's just another, you know, person with a handout for women that get hit.  I tell you what, isn't it great, though, that she yanked all that money, 
[04:42:30]  and all she did was, like, with every dollar she yanked, two more teeth got loosened.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Tee-hee.  There you go, girls.  Black guys for everyone because she doesn't have a sense of humor.  Yeah.  This doesn't make any sense.  It's like I'm going to – you know, we're all here to support these women,  and I thought those guys weren't funny, so I'm taking money away from these ladies.  Yeah.  I wonder what they would have done if De Niro or somebody had volunteered to, say, be the emcee.  Would they have objected because he beat his wife in Raging Bull? 
[04:43:00]  It's once again the double standard for comedy.  Of course not.  She's revolting.  Right.  And again, look at what Paula Poundstone was in the news for.  Well, yeah, I don't know that Paula did anything.  No, I said she was in the news for.  It was alleged.  Alleged.  Yeah, they forgave her.  Yeah, they're fine with her now.  But you weren't even accused of that, and what bugged me is this woman ran a woman's choice clinic,  which is basically – it's an abortion clinic, correct?  Yeah, I guess so.  And you're talking about beating up your kid.  I'm like, well, at least they had the thing.  God almighty, at least you guys had it and loved it and repainted the room. 
[04:43:30]  She didn't even want to repaint the room.  She's like, ah, let's just leave it as study.  Well, this is what I love about the stuff they chose of mine to complain about.  They obviously combed through my act looking for something that was against women.  Yeah.  I don't talk about any women or hitting women.  But they found, oh, he hit a little girl.  So if I had done a bit about hitting my little boy, they would have said, ah, who cares?  Yeah, I wouldn't have been in there.  Let him hit the little faggot.  Nobody cares about boys.  I love where it says, joking about decimating his stupid four-year-old daughter by bashing her in the head. 
[04:44:00]  It looks so good in writing.  It looks like a restraining order.  Yeah, really.  It looks like she thinks my daughter is –  Louie, do you remember that picture you took?  What's that?  That picture that's in the paper.  Do you remember that from anywhere?  Can you trace that picture back?  Like, oh, I remember this picture.  That's me from an HBO special, the half hour I did two years ago.  Oh, really?  Okay, all right.  It's a publicity photo they got from HBO.  So HBO supplied that to help them malign me. 
[04:44:30]  Yeah, because you look like a lunatic, and Patrice just looks like he's ready to carjack you.  I know.  Patrice looks like he's going, oh, were the people there?  I didn't know.  Well, I mean, you don't want to – I mean, as a comic, we all know that people like Liz Abzug and Merle Hoffman,  I mean, that's basically the target audience because they're very funny people.  You know, women who are involved in social causes always have wonderful senses of humor.  Oh, twist it. 
[04:45:00]  They're hilarious.  That's the whole point.  The whole point of this stupid event was let's take this out of our realm and go get some – you know, it was – Rich Voss was there.  The bill was a dirty, nasty bunch of guys because we pull in numbers and we make money for them.  We didn't get paid to do this.  We did this for them.  And so the idea that this lady is going to, like, protest by – you know, because she should just go over to that shelter and start hitting women.  She didn't think we were funny.  Well, not only should she, but I think we ought to as well. 
[04:45:30]  I love women.  I love it, man.  Why is – no one has too much about me.  No, no reason.  I mean, no, no, I didn't go through a horrible experience this weekend that I'm devastated.  No, no, no.  Oh, believe me, when it comes to a little woman bashing this week is Jimmy's week.  Oh, boy, you picked the right guy.  Yeah, this hit a perfect day for us.  I make LaMotta look like Alan Alda this week.  I can picture Norton's entire left side going out of his socket trying to punch anything. 
[04:46:00]  Sorry, I didn't mean to laugh that hard.  That's right.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  You're hurting today.  I shouldn't have laughed at it.  What happened, Jim?  Nothing does comedy better than being quoted so that you can tell how funny it is in an angry article.  Because Patrice's bit is obviously ugly.  I mean, just the fact that she spelled out arg.  Yeah, arg.  I mean, it reads funny.  A lot of A's, by the way.  And it's not my – Louis, it's not even my – it's a – it's just that.  It's a thing.  It's one of those.  It's going around.  It's a thing.  It's yours now, buddy.  Yeah, no kidding.  Arg. 
[04:46:30]  All right, Louis.  Hey, you got any gigs coming up, man?  Yeah, I'm doing Vegas.  I'll see you out there, man.  I'll be flying out there with an empty seat next to me in the plane.  So take care, man.  We'll see you there.  I'm doing the Saget Show.  Oh.  Maybe the three of us can hang out since there won't be four.  Yeah.  Thank you so much, no.  All right.  Thank you, Louis.  Thank you so much, no.  Thanks, Louis.  By the way, before we move on, someone's got – what?  What happened?  No, the empty seat.  I was pointing at Greg and see if it was the empty seat.  What?  If you was the empty seat.  Oh, no.  Oh, okay.  What is girlfriend? 
[04:47:00]  We didn't break up.  Oh, this is – oh, this is the – you broke up with your girl.  Well –  I didn't feel no magic there anyway, dude.  Nice.  Wasn't no magic there.  I saw – I met his – I met – I'm good at that, man.  I met it.  There's magic with him – you and your girl.  Yeah.  I never really see you guys together, you and your girl.  It's, like, weird.  I hope he doesn't take her out.  He doesn't – it's weird.  It's only certain circumstances.  No, when I see you together, it's never enough where I can get a magical – where I  can feel something.  Well, it's usually during radio events where I have to worry about so much crap. 
[04:47:30]  Right.  But this new one here – because when I first met Norton, I hated Norton with a passion.  We did a gig up in somewhere where it snows even in the summer.  It was a college.  No.  It was someplace – he brought his girl and he was just – it was a six-hour drive and  I had no car.  Just got there.  Just met Norton.  Oh, yeah.  We had met before then, though.  Oh, I hated him.  And he was just – he was just oodly-boodly-ing with his girl for six hours. 
[04:48:00]  I'm in the back like –  Oodly-boodly.  I'm in the back like a slave, like a – I'm sitting back there like, hey, let's do some  comic talking, you know, about life.  And he's just like – and driving down Route 17 with no lights.  And it's just like – but he loved that girl.  This new one there that you just broke up with, eh, I didn't feel it.  It was supposed to go anywhere.  I don't know, man.  I didn't feel it.  I didn't feel it at all.  I saw it.  That should help him today.  I hope that helps.  Norton, you're a celebrity, dude. 
[04:48:30]  I'm a – I'm a –  Oh, boy.  No, I'm not.  He's going to tell you exactly.  What are you talking about?  Here he goes.  I'm a – I'm a – no, I'm not.  There it is.  What did she – what did she – what did she enable for you to miss her now?  What do you miss?  I don't – well –  It's your own ego that's acting up Norton.  It's not even a miss thing because I'm so angry that I don't think I would want to repair  it even if I could.  What did she do?  Just – she's fought, you know.  What did she do?  It's good that anger's there instead of like complete like just sadness.  Wait, what does she do?  What did she do to you? 
[04:49:00]  Oh, nothing.  Why are you mad?  We just fought.  You know how it is.  You fight and it's just ugly.  It gets ugly fast.  And you got rid of her?  It was mutual.  No, I can't say I did.  It was mutual.  You're going to come crawling back to her?  No.  It's over.  Good.  We're done.  Now, Replay – now, how many women do you think – the void – how many – how much emptiness  do you have now?  Five women?  How tall am I?  Five.  There was –  How many women do you think –  Oh, my God.  How many women do you think –  Let me enjoy that one.  How many women do you think – 
[04:49:30]  It's like a science project.  It will take to fill that void now.  I don't know.  Let's see.  We started last night.  $300.  No, man.  The chase of square girls.  You got to chase a square girl.  I completely get that.  But at 2.30 in the morning, kind of hard to fight a square girl.  You got to get a circle off Craigslist.  So, it was sexual emptiness?  No.  Partial.  But no, no, no.  That's not – I can't even – I won't knock her for that.  No, that was more my thing, actually.  No.  He doesn't want to trash her either. 
[04:50:00]  So, he's –  No, I can't.  No.  That's not Jimmy's thing.  Yeah, I was just –  It is Jimmy's thing.  Who are you – do you even know him?  No, not trashing like this close.  Oh, in like a couple of weeks?  Forget it.  Yeah, I can't.  He'll be, you know, calling her awful things.  Are you going to take a bet?  He's sad.  No, she doesn't want to get back with me.  I don't want to get back with her.  There's nothing she wants to get back and I don't or I want to and she doesn't.  He's sad.  It only happened two nights ago and we're not going to talk.  That's it.  I know it's it.  Look at his eyes.  Has all the stuff been removed from your place, anything that was hers?  While we were arguing. 
[04:50:30]  While you were arguing that was happening?  Wow.  Are you serious?  Wow.  Your mansion is now empty?  Well, there was never much there.  It was just a few pair of panties and, you know –  Oh, I'm going through it now, dude.  I mean, it ends up, you know, with her coats in my closet.  I'm just like, wow.  I got a million coats and jackets.  I'm looking at what's this – what's this girl's fur coat doing in my jacket?  Sweetie, can you get your –  Wow, you're that territorial where you don't even want –  Because that's where it starts.  It starts there.  It starts. 
[04:51:00]  It's just –  And then before you know it, what?  Before you know it, I can turn around and it's just – everything is everywhere.  I banish her stuff to where I never see it.  That's why Patrice is brilliant.  Dude.  Banish her stuff.  Patrice is going to be doing a relationship – his relationship show in November.  In November.  In November.  Yep.  25th.  Yeah, then Black Phillip.  On that Sam exclusively, right.  A couple weeks.  No, a week from Saturday.  Go ahead.  Mike, I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But I'm saying she knows. 
[04:51:30]  My girl knows that I am looking for the big fight because I've had no other women in my house.  In my crown molding painted house.  I have had no one in there except for her and her kid.  So you're looking for the big fight.  I'm just – she knows I'm sniffing out something.  Like, if you're going to have a fight with a girl –  Get out, bitch!  You know, and she just goes.  If you're going to have a fight with a woman, it's going to be a big one and it's going to be her because who else are you going to fight with? 
[04:52:00]  I got to have a big fight with her so I can have some – she knows I'm waiting to have somebody else come in there.  Are you serious?  You're not?  Your mansion's empty?  Your mansion tax house with some ungrateful stuff in your house?  Your big Panasonic TV and you all frumpy?  It's ego, stupid.  No, I say I know the ego thing.  It definitely is part of it.  But then there's times where you just get sad because you like somebody a lot, maybe love them.  No, it's the banana in the tailpipe.  Here's why she did that.  She started to fear who you are. 
[04:52:30]  So she tried to control that by leaving you first, by making the move because you're in a mansion and you're on the radio and she's like,  I'm going to get out of this because I'm a little too in love with you.  That's her problem.  She was too into you knowing she knows it's stupid because you told her,  Hey, I'm Jim Norton and I might just not be in here, blah, blah, blah.  And she bounced to save her own life, dude.  That's what she did.  That's what they do.  A preemptive strike?  Yes, to get out of it.  It's self-sabotage. 
[04:53:00]  She's into you too much.  She loves you too much, Norton.  How the hell do you know all this stuff?  Because I know how I am.  I'm dipped in low self-esteem.  It's melting off one layer at a time every 10 years.  And I know how people do things.  Like I said, my girl is engaged to me.  I'm not engaged to her.  She feels more than a girlfriend.  Her love for me is more than a girlfriend.  She's my girlfriend.  I love her.  But she's just my girlfriend right now. 
[04:53:30]  But I don't want to make her not feel like she needs her.  That's what's wrong with women.  They get to a point where they feel a certain way about you, and they need you to be exactly the same level.  And it's impossible because when you take a woman out, you are auditioning everything to her, and she's auditioning nothing to you.  So when she's liking you, you're not liking her back.  You understand what I'm saying?  Wow.  To the same degree.  So that she's into you.  Trust me. 
[04:54:00]  She's suffering.  Where is she going to find somebody else?  You're a winner.  You win a lottery.  You understand?  What other worm does she know that has to pay mansion tax?  Hey, this is Louis CK.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And I don't know what else you're doing, but I hope you die soon.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I like my penis.  Kenny was telling me I got to go.  He's pointing.  We got to get Anthony out of here. 
[04:54:30]  He's got a plane.  Are you flying today?  Yes, I am.  Have a safe trip.  I'll be in sunny Miami.  Have a safe trip.  It's great to see you say hi to my ex-in-laws.  I will.  Absolutely.  You look great, man.  Thanks.  So do you.  No, I mean you got a nice cock.  That's what I meant.  I'm sorry.  Anthony is all cock.  Is that true?  It's disgusting.  All cock.  No talk.  It's a big Italian mess.  We've told the cock story this time.  Dinty more can.  He's got something going on.  I'm still working on the smell of onions. 
[04:55:00]  I can't get over that.  Jimmy's oniony bag.  Anthony doesn't shave his pubes either.  It's fucking.  Just picture a blood sausage in a shrub.  No one look at Anthony's cock when he walks out of here.  Don't look at my cock.  No, I pointed it out before because I was wearing light pants and I was happy that I didn't get any dribble when I pissed.  Because when you wear light pants, the slightest little dribble and everyone will just.  Do you have leakage?  Well, no.  But, you know, if you're in a hurry and you're doing a radio show, you got to make sure, you know, you get back before you're on the air. 
[04:55:30]  You got to pull your dick in and oh, fuck.  And then it's just like out there.  Or I've done that before where I've then washed my hands and splashed my shirt really badly and gone, fucking sink.  Yeah.  In there.  Ah, God.  I was in a hurry so bad.  I pissed all over my hands.  I was washing my hands in my own piss.  Yeah.  And then I soaked my cock in the sink and my hands were covered in piss.  I was like opposite day.  It's stupid.  It's like when you use preparation age instead of toothpaste and your mouth hemming.  Yeah.  It shibbles up.  And then Crest just burns your asshole. 
[04:56:00]  Crest burns your asshole.  But your asshole smells great.  Yeah.  You talk with your asshole.  You talk with your teeth in your asshole.  All right, Anthony.  Sorry.  Have a safe trip.  Bye, Anthony.  Maybe I should put the sniper shirt on before I get on the plane.  Cut it out.  That's wrong.  Hide your cock when you walk out of here.  It's always scared me when there's a giant audience.  Here we go.  They're very nice.  They're very, very nice.  Look how ashamed Anthony is on his cock.  That's right.  I'm ashamed of my giant cock.  You can't cover that with a vest, can you, kid? 
[04:56:30]  Bye, Akak.  Have a safe trip, sweetie.  Have fun at the old Westbury Music Fair.  What is it?  North Fork.  Thank you.  North Fork tonight.  We'll talk to you soon, man.  Bye, sweetie.  Have a great trip.  Thank you, Drew.  Yes, I will.  Are you covering peace spots right now?  Oh, yeah, I am.  I'll give you a call.  I've got my satellite phone.  So I'll call you from the ocean.  See, we really are friends off the air.  Bye.  Bye, love.  I'll miss you.  All right.  Hoodie.  Oh, darn.  By the way, I want something from, I want something from my, I want something from Miami. 
[04:57:00]  Hey, can we follow Anthony all the way to his car?  Just follow him outside, Sam.  Okay.  Because we got a coffee.  Shut up.  This is hilarious.  It's not even a joke.  Someone do an Anthony impression and read the fucking copy because it ain't going to be made.  All right, hold on.  Let me do an Anthony impression.  Down with the Jews.  All right, we got you.  Just follow Anthony.  We got a line of the day.  Jimmy is so funny.  No, I'm not doing it.  Doing what?  I can't.  He won't. 
[04:57:30]  He's Anthony.  I've got to go.  Earl Douglas, ladies and gentlemen.  Earl Douglas.  That was more than Earl deserved.  Ah, and here I am walking out.  I'm leaving the show before it's over.  You're insane.  Eastside Dave.  I'm meeting him in the hallway.  It's like celebrities out here.  The cruise.  How you doing, sir?  Congratulations on your cruise.  Thank you.  Thank you.  It's going to be a great cruise.  What?  Is this going on the air?  Yes, David.  I didn't know this was on the air.  Oh, fuck.  Talking to that end.  Fuck it.  And actually, I want to say congratulations on your upcoming nuptials. 
[04:58:00]  Thank you.  I'm very happy for you.  Thank you very much.  You have a beautiful woman there.  You've always been there for me.  Not always.  The last couple weeks.  At the beginning, I thought you were a complete fucking douchebag.  Right.  I hated you.  All right.  Well, then the last month, you've been there for me.  Okay.  Last, like, maybe couple of days.  Days.  Something like that.  But the last 48 hours, you've really been there for me.  Yeah.  Two days.  Okay.  Let's go with two days.  I've been there.  Kenny's yelling at you.  Now, if I'm late, it's your fault. 
[04:58:30]  On the elevator.  Sam?  The wireless mic actually works.  Hey, Sam.  Hi.  Yeah.  Oh, it's a crowded elevator.  We're going to have Sam on the phone, too.  Anthony leaving the show.  Going down, everybody.  A lot of the day is brought to you by Bodogfight.com, by the way.  Yeah.  Oh, fourth floor.  Good.  It's going to stop on every floor.  Oh, yes, sir.  Get out.  He's out.  Yeah.  No, we'll get him after he gets off the elevator.  All right.  We got some runner-up lines of the day.  Here's the first one from Bodogfight.com. 
[04:59:00]  For Jim, it's one on the back.  It's a quote.  I want to raise him.  It says, uh...  Whose cunt is that?  I want to eat it.  There you go.  Runner-up line of the day.  Take care.  Have a good day.  Goodbye, doll.  Guys, people have to get off on every floor.  We're going to do two.  See, you couldn't do this on regular radio, Bob.  This is just terrific stuff, isn't it?  I love this shit.  Thank you for having me.  Sam?  Actually, I'm thinking I'm just shit myself.  Sam?  All right.  I think I thought.  All right. 
[04:59:30]  Oh, now he's in the...  All the way.  He's eagerly waiting.  My vacation's starting.  My vacation is starting.  Right now, sir.  Goodbye.  Jimmy Norton hates you.  Goodbye.  He called you a pile of shit with a tie on it.  The funniest part is that he fucking an ELO in the fucking hallway.  Oof.  I hope that went out.  I don't have headphones or anything.  That's the line of the day.  How are you doing, sir?  Serious satellite radio, right? 
[05:00:00]  Okay.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  We told Sam.  Morpheus is sitting in my truck.  There he goes.  Oh, oh, oh.  And we could get hit by a truck.  Oh, no.  Oh.  Oh, they're looking at me out the window.  Thank you, Master Poe.  Safe trip, Anthony.  Thank you, Master Poe.  Take care.  All right.  Have a great time, man.  Thank you, Kenny and Sam. 
[05:00:30]  You want me to take the mic and drive and see how far the fucking range is?  You asshole.  Sam's getting in the car with you.  Now, I...  Hold on.  Hold on.  Can he hear us?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Oh, good.  Thank you, Master Poe.  Now, I'm going to annoy you like a caller.  Thank you, Kenny.  Hello?  Hello?  Am I on the...  I can drive and see how the fucking range is.  Am I on the air?  I'm getting in the car. 
[05:01:00]  Oh, shut the fuck up, you savage.  See?  Goddamn camp drivers.  This is the real one.  Oh, I wish I could take this mic with me.  I am going to be hot to get home.  All right.  Take care.  Have fun.  I'm driving away with the microphone.  All right.  Get out of here.  Are you really gone?  Someone call Anthony's phone.  Sam?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What happened?  Anthony's car now.  He's driving away.  He's driving away?  Yeah.  We winded in the car with him. 
[05:01:30]  He's gone now.  All right.  Someone call his phone.  We'll get him back on in a second here.  Where are you guys going?  Oh, I can't tell you that, Bob.  Where exactly?  I'm going to Schenectady.  Really?  You guys spend the whole time there like a resort there of some kind?  No, I'm taking a trip.  It's called to Girlfriend's Pussy Town.  Right.  I'm going to fuck her for the next two weeks brutally.  Do you ever make a snuff film with her?  I'd love to.  Excuse me.  A couple of trucks, different directions.  Excuse me, Anthony's on the phone.  Oh, hi, Ant.  I'd best not get pulled over because I'm using a cell phone illegally. 
[05:02:00]  How's your vacation going?  That's the least of our...  I'm relaxing on a beach.  I have a banana daiquiri.  That's the least of our problems, by the way.  Didn't you read the New York Times today?  All right.  Hello?  I lost you.  Sorry.  I hope you lost me.  Jimmy, this was just like that fucking cell phone commercial, I hope.  Jimmy, did you hear that I told the guy downstairs?  Yeah, we heard it.  Yeah, I was rolling. 
[05:02:30]  I wasn't sure.  I was rolling.  I was going out.  Good.  Now he knows.  And then I tried to improv after, and it got less than a zero.  When you said, Jimmy says you're a piece of shit, I improv'd.  Wow, who knew Elo was in the hall?  And it got nothing twice.  See, there was a secret part of me.  Let me break the wall for the audience.  I was hoping they just didn't hear it.  But they did.  Hold on.  Okay, I had to soak in that for a second.  How's the traffic there, buddy?  I'm making my way across town. 
[05:03:00]  Not bad right now.  But over by Park, it gets a little silly, and I have to really get offensive.  I practice offensive driving.  Because when you're in a city with cab drivers that are all just really, well, you know.  Hey, can we keep the channel on with you just driving home?  Maybe you can crank up the radio and sing along as you're driving.  Oh, and see what I do on my normal drive home?  Yeah, just, it doesn't even matter if it's good.  All right, let me see if I could.  All right, figure out what you want to listen to on the way home. 
[05:03:30]  And we'll just have the channel on.  It'll be Anthony driving home.  People will listen just for the hell of it.  All right, figure it out.  We're going to do one of the.  They're nice to me.  Yeah, a little foreigner.  I'm psyched.  I'm on vacation.  By the way, the new 2007 virus, O&H Island virus t-shirts are on sale at myradiostore.com. 
[05:04:00]  Very cool.  Nice.  Anthony's on vacation.  He's singing along in his car.  I'm completely punchy now.  I know.  Well, this is what we're doing to people.  Fucking fun.  I'm out of here.  I'll see you guys.  Have a safe vacation, everybody.  We're going to leave you with the sounds of Anthony driving home.  Anthony, you go as long as you want, okay?  All right.  All right.  Anthony driving his car.  We'll see you guys in a little while.  Great vacation, everybody.  That's a vacation.  To the studio audience, thank you.  Thanks for the support.  We greatly appreciate it.  Drew Boogie, thank you.  We'll just keep Anthony on in his car and run a Fezzer up at noon. 
[05:04:30]  Thanks, guys.  Oh, that's good.  I'm getting out of the way.  Look at this idiot.  All right.  Little Peter Gabriel.  Ooh.  Just about to 2nd Avenue.  You know?  My favorite part is getting on the Queensborough Bridge. 
[05:05:00]  Because no one understands you can't go straight here.  If I get pulled over, it'll be really interesting.  Having to explain to the police officer why I'm using a cell phone.  All right.  I'm bored with that song.  Here's some awful music on XM.  Oh, am I on the air?  Fuck. 
[05:05:30]  What is that?  Oh, how about...  The...  The Boneyard.  Oh.  Metallica.  One.  One.  One.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Two.  Three.  Ding dong.  Pretty boring drive.  Sorry. 
[05:06:00]  Not many, uh...  Not many assholes on the road.  Ding dong.  Uh, what?  What?  Hello?  Hello?  Is anyone in here?  Hello?  Hello?  Hi.  What's your name?  My name's John.  What's your name?  I'm Tony.  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  How are you?  Uh, good.  So, uh...  Anyone else in the room?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, um... 
[05:06:30]  Where are you from?  Uh, New York City.  Yeah?  What do you like?  Uh, you know, the usual.  I don't...  What's the usual?  Uh...  Well, how...  How big's your cock?  Faggot!  Sorry, I thought I was calling the gay hotline. 
[05:07:00]  I got mixed up.  I didn't realize I was...  No, you ass.  I wanted to talk about hockey.  You told me.  Yeah.  Come on.  There we go.  People don't...  Oh, shit.  My tongue is just squealing.  I keep forgetting I'm in a big vehicle.  I try to drive this like a race car.  Where are you going on vacation? 
[05:07:30]  Uh, I can't say.  You can't say?  No, it's top secret.  Is it somewhere warm?  Actually, I'll be in Miami, too.  Will you?  Oh, you want to...  You want to hook up?  This is terrible.  How come every other day, it's like a harrowing drive home, and I'm making every light.  There's no one in my way.  This can only mean the second I hang up.  Well, that's why...  Pandemonium.  That's why I thought this would be a good idea, because of the old days when we used to drive 
[05:08:00]  in together.  Yeah.  I'm not going to, you know, fake it.  I would...  Well, okay, that was a little annoying.  What was that?  Somebody just jammed on the brakes in front of me.  For no fucking reason.  I love that one.  And now I'm entering this area in Queens where people don't understand that these lights stay  green on this side for like two seconds, and you've got to really move quickly.  But now there's a cop vehicle in front of me, so I can't really beep at him. 
[05:08:30]  I'll just beep.  What's the protocol with the cop trucks that haul around like the roadblocks and shit?  There's no one in there that can like get you in trouble.  Nah, those...  They're just driving a fucking truck.  I think those guys are the plebes, man.  They're fine.  Beep.  Beep at them.  They're not real...  They're not real cops.  They just look.  Yeah, they don't have any radios or anything.  I don't see an antenna, so fuck them.  Please drive on the sidewalk in front of everybody.  Oh, shit. 
[05:09:00]  I don't think I could get up through there.  No.  No, not through that.  Well, if the road was blocked, because this is also the area where big rigs back into these  warehouses and block the road for like fucking 10 minutes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then that's when I make my sidewalk moves.  But if this guy decides he's going to do it, I could do it.  But the cop vehicle, that would be really funny.  It would just look at me like I'm a real asshole.  All right.  There he goes.  Okay. 
[05:09:30]  Yeah, so...  Okay, we're done.  I got nothing going on here.  It's the easy drive home.  What do you mean?  There's like no traffic, really.  There's no assholes in my way.  And then what happened?  And then...  Come on.  Where are you going on vacation?  What?  I'm going to be on vacation with your mom.  I'm going to be banging your mom.  See, Anthony can't hear me right now.  What do you like about our show? 
[05:10:00]  I like the fact that I do all the heavy lifting and do all the hard work for the show and take all the meetings and think up all the bits for the entire show.  What I like about the show, I like the chemistry between you and I.  I think it's beyond amazing since day one.  We're out of here.  Have...  I was going to say have a good vacation.  I guess we're on vacation.  So, guys, you guys have a good vacation, too.  We'll see you guys soon.
