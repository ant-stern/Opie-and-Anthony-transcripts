<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about a flight attendant's alleged impromptu striptease following a wet t-shirt contest on a plane, prompting debate about its appropriateness and passenger reactions.  This was followed by a listener, Lisa, complaining vehemently about the unsatisfying ending of a Stephen King miniseries.  The hosts then transitioned into a lengthy critique of the New York Yankees' trade of David Wells, with caller Doug joining the conversation.  Their commentary was filled with humorous, often crude, remarks about Wells' personality.

A trivia contest, offering Black Crowes tickets as a prize, asked what Oprah Winfrey could do to boost her ratings (the answer: show her "balloon knot"). A caller correctly answered and won.  Numerous listeners then called in to deliver various "F.U.s" to a range of targets, including George Steinbrenner, employers, and ex-girlfriends.  Studio guest Ralph the Tour shared a humorous anecdote about attempting to return substandard, street-bought sheets ("they don't go").

A caller facing imminent jail time requested Black Crowes tickets as a final fling before incarceration, leading to a listener poll on whether he deserved them. The show then veered into a caller's graphic account of contracting genital warts during a business trip, met with ribbing from the hosts. They then launched into a discussion of shocking medical videos featuring a man with a re-attached intestine and another with a second face, replete with explicit descriptions and humorous commentary.

Model Tara, a previous nude model for the show, was in the studio for another photoshoot for the website.  The hosts provided explicit commentary on her outfits and poses throughout the photoshoot.  The show concluded with the hosts revealing they received an FCC complaint highlighting past outrageous segments, including a woman straddling Twinkies and detailed descriptions of previous photoshoots.  The complaint also listed recipients, including the Mayor of New York City.

Earlier in the broadcast, a letter from "Marianne" criticizing the show's content, including a body-judging contest, a segment mocking a man's fear of whips and chains (due to his ancestry and *Roots*), and the broadcast of pornographic website addresses, was addressed. The hosts defended their actions, emphasizing listener ratings and the option to turn off the radio.  They reiterated details of previous on-air stunts involving Tara and the distribution of her photos online. Earl was present in the studio.  Further listener calls included both support and obscene messages directed at Marianne. Anthony shared details of his high school activities performing pregnancy tests for money.  Additional topics touched upon included listener complaints about annoying behaviors, the upcoming Marilyn Manson concert, the David Wells trade, and an interview with a seemingly intoxicated individual named Yoshi about the Chinese New Year.  The broadcast also mentioned new photos of Tara for the website.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, I saw that.  And then the flight attendant after the wet t-shirt contest decided to do a striptease for all the girls.  And he was like a 30-year-old guy or whatever he was.  What a mess.  An absolute mess.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be running into a little bit of turbulence, so hey, you're going to see some bouncing cans now.  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey, what do you got, man?  I was the one who called, hung up behind the phone, but I had to take that, but I'm back.  Yeah, that was great.  Did you happen to notice, like, all through that show last night, they kept announcing for the news, check it out, check it out. 
[00:00:30]  At 10 o'clock, you would do the wet t-shirt contest, and I think you'd come on until, like, a quarter to 11.  I know.  Well, that's what they do.  The big tease.  They make it sound like, oh, my God, look how horrible this is.  But they use it because they know everyone wants to see it.  Did you hear that lady complaining?  Yeah.  I can't play.  Can't match back the wrong lady this time.  Well, you know, I hate to say it, but she definitely has a good point, I guess.  I would love to sit here and go, that's great.  But, hey, if I was in, like, the back row of the plane, I'd be pretty damn paranoid.  Grab the phone. 
[00:01:00]  Look at it this way.  There are planes where it's business as usual.  Everything's boring.  You're sitting there that go down.  Yeah.  Huh?  This plane made it, didn't it?  Yeah.  Everyone had a grand old time, huh?  That's good.  So who cares?  I don't think it makes any difference.  There's a party bus in the sky.  That's all you need?  I don't know, man.  Did you notice last night during the TV show, the guy with the crushed hand, the one guy  to pick it up?  You know, they're talking about timing.  It was crucial to get his hand back to the hospital.  Here's a guy to pick it up, and he's, like, walking straight.  I saw that.  He was taking his time. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, time is of the essence to get it back and reattach the hand.  Meanwhile, the ambulance guy, he's got it in his hand, and he's this little saunter down  the street.  Yeah.  Not even rushing.  Holding it by, like, two fingers, and the guts are, like, falling out of the head.  I think it's hard to run when you're nauseous, because...  Too funny.  That freaked me out.  There was a lot of great TV on last night.  There sure was.  One of which, I must say, wasn't really the Stephen King movie, the third part.  Well, Lisa from, right now, I'm in Edison. 
[00:02:00]  Lisa writes, I want to send a big F you to Stephen King for the worst ending to a three-part  movie ever.  I watched the damn movie for two nights, and then I was very disappointed last night.  First of all, I hate what they're doing with two- and three-part movies.  All right?  Sunday, we watch part one.  Monday, we watch part two.  And then what happens?  Part three.  Thursday.  You kind of lose interest by then, you know?  Mm-hmm.  That sucks, first off.  Well, what was the problem with part three?  Well, the whole thing with the first two parts of this movie is this demon guy, or whatever 
[00:02:30]  the hell he is, comes to this small island town, and he starts making people kill themselves  and doing evil stuff.  And he goes, well, just give me what I want, and I'll go away.  Mm-hmm.  So the whole two parts, you're like, what does this guy want?  It's got to be something pretty wild.  What does he want?  Right.  What does he want?  Now I'm hooked.  Yeah.  So the last half hour of the third part, he finally decides to tell everybody what he wants.  He wants a kid to teach his ways to carry on in his little thing, whatever he does, which 
[00:03:00]  wasn't explained.  And then they give him a kid, and he goes away.  And that was it?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  The whole thing is based on him, give me what I want, and I'll go away.  Well, it ends.  They gave what he wanted, and he went away.  And that was it.  Woo!  Steven.  Ridiculous.  Steven.  Write some good stuff.  What are you doing?  I wrote this one expressly for telling this.  This is one of my most scariest moving camera. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, well.  He's frightening.  All right.  Listen.  We've got Black Crowes tickets to give away, and we'd like to give them to our faithful  listeners, you know, because there's a lot of concert pigs out there that just listen  to N.E.W. today to win the tickets.  Mm-hmm.  We want to try to take care of the people that have been with us for a while now.  So we're going to ask some Opie and Anthony trivia once again today for the Black Crowes  tickets.  All right.  Then we know that you listen to the show, and we're taking care of you.  Like, you take care of us.  All right.  That works.  Um, want to do the Oprah Winfrey question? 
[00:04:00]  Hmm.  Hmm.  The Oprah Winfrey question.  I'm just trying to think, what the hell is the Oprah Winfrey question?  Remember we were talking about how Jerry Springer is kicking her ass in the ratings?  Yes.  Happened again this week, by the way.  Oh, okay.  I think I know it.  All right.  So what was the question?  What should Oprah show on her show to get ratings?  What should she expose?  That's it.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:04:30]  And you've got to use the exact term we used.  Okay.  All right.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNW, Black Crowes, kicking my heart around.  All weekend long, you've got chances to win tickets to see the Black Crowes, and right  now we're giving away a pair.  What's the Opie and Anthony trivia question again, Anthony?  You might remember we discussed Oprah Winfrey getting all pissed at Jerry Springer, saying  that if the sleaze isn't cleared from the airwaves, she's quitting television.  And Opie made a suggestion. 
[00:05:00]  Well, because she's ticked off because she's just getting her ass kicked.  Yeah.  Her ratings are getting beaten by Jerry Springer.  Yeah.  So Opie had a suggestion, Oprah, that maybe if she exposes something, her ratings will  go up.  Mm-hmm.  And we want the proper terminology.  Yes.  Yes.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, man.  Can I send out an F to you?  Yeah, go ahead.  All right, cool.  I want to send out an F to you to George Steinbrunner.  Well, a lot of people are...  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You're on the air, dude, live. 
[00:05:30]  I am?  Yeah.  Oh, no, sorry.  All right.  Yeah, I'm listening, too, because you should trade yourself.  All right.  I can't send your response, by the way.  All right, man.  Bye.  Thanks, bud.  Oh, I hate those digital phones.  They want an answer.  Hi, N.E.W., who's this?  They want an answer.  My name is Joanne.  Hi, Joanne, we got you live in the air.  What is the answer to the Opie and Anthony trivia question?  The balloon knot.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Oprah should go on TV and show the world her balloon knot, and she would get better ratings. 
[00:06:00]  That's right.  That's correct.  I would tune in to see that.  Ugh.  Where are you calling from?  Um, Newark right now.  All right, hold on the line.  You got Black Crow's tickets.  Oh, my God.  You're kidding me.  You're not kidding you?  Yes, you are.  You're pulling my leg.  No.  No, you are.  You're joking me now.  No, no, no, no, no.  I sent you that poll yesterday.  Did you get it?  Oh, yeah.  We got your poll.  No, did you like that one?  Oh, I loved it.  My God, it was great.  Yeah.  No, swear?  Yeah, I got it.  All right, that's me.  Okay, great. 
[00:06:30]  No, you got the Black Crow's tickets.  No, I didn't.  Oh, my God, you did.  You want me to just go on to the next caller?  No, please don't.  All right, then you hold the line.  Okay.  What station wants to see your balloon knot?  Oh, my God.  What station?  Yeah.  W-N-E-W.  Okay.  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  Line two.  Where's your balloon knot station?  Ho-ho.  I just hate when stations go, what's your fiber riding on station?  Ho-ho.  Like they're not going to say, like they're going to say another station after you gave him  a prize.  All right.  Chris from Colmack, Long Island's home to the Colmack Motor Inn, writes, F you to George 
[00:07:00]  Steinbrenner and his baby-faced a-hole of a GM for trading away the only real and down-earth  player in David Wells.  That beer-drinking, stripper-watching, partying guy is what all New York men can relate with.  He is a regular guy, unlike many of his baseball cohorts.  While many are on their cell phones with their agents and stockbrokers, Wells would use  a payphone to order Domino's and a six-pack.  That's a great email.  I'm bummed.  You know, now that I've had a day to think about it, I'd rather see David Wells pitch. 
[00:07:30]  I know Roger Clemens is a great pitcher and you have to make the trade, but I'm just sick  of us, meaning New York, trading away the hearts of these teams.  I would rather see Oakley play this year.  I'd rather see Wells pitch.  You know, I can understand making a trade.  I can completely understand making a trade if the Yankees were in a position where they  needed a pitching staff.  And they were in a position where they were in jeopardy of not making it into the World 
[00:08:00]  Series this coming season.  But obviously, they're going to win.  They're going to win every game this year.  Of course they are.  Well, you don't need a rocket.  Man, Doug, I didn't think you were coming in today.  I didn't think I'd come in today.  Say hello to you, boy.  So you think it's a terrible trade?  I think it's a terrible trade for baseball.  All right.  Terrible.  You know, you're on hour, I believe, 30 discussing the trade.  Hour 30 discussing the trade.  Yeah.  It's a horrible trade. 
[00:08:30]  Terrible trade for baseball.  All right.  I think there ought to be a celery cap in baseball.  A what?  A celery cap.  Celery cap.  Oh, salary cap.  That's what I said.  Celery cap.  Celery cap.  Can't you hear me?  All right.  I said a celery cap.  All right.  We're going to be back after this Toyota commercial.  You like Toyota, don't you?  I like Toyotas.  Come on.  Wait.  Hey, those Yankees, they're going to win every game.  And now this way is from Tom Oliver.  Tom Oliver.  Greg from Staten Island writes, through the fax line, 212-957-WNEW, 
[00:09:00]  please send an FU to my jackass boss for thinking me and my fellow co-workers are alcoholics for going out last night,  getting drunk, and coming in 15 minutes late today.  He would drink, too, if he had to work for him.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, Eve 6, and Leach.  It's Opie and Anthony on FU Friday.  Whoa, sorry about that.  That just ended.  I guess it goes into the next song on the CD, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:09:30]  Sorry about that.  Ralph the Tour is in the studio.  Ralph.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  We love Ralph.  He's our pal.  Show's sounding great, by the way.  Thank you very much.  I love the noon hour.  I'm enjoying it.  I got a little help, though.  What do you mean?  From other people.  What do you mean?  You know, everybody calls up with their requests and stuff.  Yeah, well.  And you put it all together, and it sounds great.  Thank you.  I was digging the toadies the other day.  Fah.  I know.  What is that?  Isn't there a law about a lot of the fax stuff like that?  Oh, I know.  Oh, that's nasty.  You should see the stuff our listeners fax us. 
[00:10:00]  Damn.  We can't discuss all of it, unfortunately.  Okay.  Well, it's not that.  Some guy just sent me a website where it's a whole website dedicated to people getting  off with vacuum cleaners.  That's dangerous.  Wasn't there a story somewhere where somebody lost the ultimate of destruction?  But they got pictures of guys, girls, couples, you name it, you know, getting off with vacuum  cleaners.  Vacuum cleaners.  You just got to make sure you don't use a flowbee.  You ever see the flowbee, the haircut thing that attaches to the vacuum?  Make sure you remove the flowbee before using the air. 
[00:10:30]  I was just trying to trim.  Yeah.  So Ralph's in the studio.  He says goodbye every night before he goes home.  And he said that he's going to be returning some sheets.  Yes.  Sheets.  That he bought.  I bought sheets on the street.  And you're going to return them?  Wait, wait.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  You bought them on the street?  Yeah.  And you're going to return them?  He was very official looking, though.  He had the badge and like this whole...  The badge.  What badge?  Well, whatever.  He bought the badge from the guy two little boots down.  All right.  So what's the deal?  You went...  You were on the way to the train and you saw a guy selling sheets and eating sheets. 
[00:11:00]  He's right outside the Penn Station.  He's right outside the Penn Station.  Right outside Penn.  Jeez.  Come on, Ralph.  But he's there every day.  All right.  He's there every day.  Now, what's the problem with the sheets?  Are they used?  What's the deal?  They don't go.  They don't go?  What do you mean?  Quote, unquote.  They don't go.  Oh, wait a minute.  They don't go.  You were trying to do something nice.  They don't go.  And buy some sheets.  You saw the sheets and go, you know, we need sheets.  So being a guy, you have no sense of what goes and what doesn't go.  Number one.  Number two, I also don't know that there is sheet whatever. 
[00:11:30]  What's the word I'm looking for?  Sizes?  No.  Queen size?  King size?  Quality.  No.  Quality.  Sizes.  Come on.  All right.  Sheet hierarchy?  The quality.  As far as how...  The basic quality.  All right.  There's a stitch.  Thread count.  Thread count.  Thread count.  Yeah.  Thread count.  So these are really...  They're $220.  They're real cheap.  No.  $220.  I've heard of...  Jeez.  There's sheets in the hundreds, actually.  Oh, is there?  That are super, super cheap.  Now, how much did you pay for these sheets?  Is that important?  Kind of. 
[00:12:00]  I want to see how much you got ripped off.  No, $20 a set.  All right.  And each set has a flat sheet, fitted sheet, and two pillowcases.  All right.  So now you're going to go there...  So you're going to go there...  Use the pillowcases.  And tell them the thread count was too low.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to tell them.  You're going to try to get your money back.  They don't go.  Do you got a tape recorder or do you got a tape?  They don't go.  I don't know.  No, I don't have my little Michael Cassery going away.  They're not going to take him back.  They don't go.  He said he'd exchange them.  Exchange them for the same sheets.  No, no.  For different sheets.  Really?  I got them committed to exchange, at least. 
[00:12:30]  Ralph, are you going to play some three-card Monty on your way down to the Penn Station?  Come on.  You're making me sound like a sucker now.  Come on.  Well...  $20 for a set of sheets is a good deal.  Just, they don't go.  Oh, I got a great New York story, man.  Who knew?  Me and...  I was playing with a rod cut.  Old band.  We'd come driving in.  Had a guy drive us into the city to do a gig.  And he's waiting out in the car.  And we come back out after the show. 
[00:13:00]  And he goes,  Guys, check it out.  Got a VCR.  I'm like, oh, VCR, huh?  A hundred bucks, he says.  And this is back when VCRs were going for three, four hundred bucks.  Yeah.  And we look at the box.  It's this shrink wrap that's really thick.  Very hard to open.  And there's just pictures cut out of a circular.  From the Wiz or something.  With VCRs on them.  And he...  Over a black box.  And he's just psyched. 
[00:13:30]  So, we feel real bad.  We got to tell him now.  You just know it's not going to be good.  Dude, that's...  There's nothing in there.  No, I'm going to feel it.  It's a big...  All right.  All right.  So, he opens it up.  And it's really a bitch to open.  They make it that way, so you can't just do it on the spot.  And there was bricks.  A couple of bricks and some newspapers rolled up inside.  He was so bummed, man.  He's like, where's the guy? 
[00:14:00]  Where is he?  I don't know.  I gave him the money.  And he, like, went off into a corner somewhere.  He was gone.  I got to tell you, I did have a fear that I was going to take these sheets home, open  over there and be holes in them.  Yeah, well, that could happen, too.  I was nervous about the game.  All right.  Seems like a nice guy.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Yeah, let us know Monday if he takes back your sheets.  I think he will.  Pre-used, maybe.  I have a lot of faith in people, so I think he will.  You're a hell of a trusting guy.  You're crazy in this city to have that much trust, man.  I don't think so.  I wouldn't even have bothered taking them back. 
[00:14:30]  Just, they're drop cloths now, you know?  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah, use them next time you're paying or something.  Rags.  Well, they may end up that way, but...  Yeah, well, maybe.  I'm going to give it a shot, anyway.  All right.  Well, good luck to you.  Let us know what happens.  Sure.  Okay.  I'll give you a call on the train.  Yeah.  Yeah, do, actually.  1027 WNEW, the rock of New York.  Tom Petty, don't do me like that on FU Friday.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  We have a guy in the line that is going to jail in two weeks,  so he needs to win the Black Crowes ticket 
[00:15:00]  so he can see one more show before he goes into the joint.  Jail.  Jail.  What do you got, man?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, who's this?  Opie and Anthony, we got you live.  Hey, I need some Black Crowes tickets.  Why?  Because I'm going to jail like a week after that concert.  Why are you going to jail?  Basically because my lying ex-girlfriend  hanging with my friends or my ex-friends,  and so I guess it's my ex-girlfriend and my ex-friends, 
[00:15:30]  and, you know, basically they set me up to save themselves.  Uh-oh.  Sounds like a drug thing.  No.  No?  No, it was like a violence thing.  All right.  Who did you beat up?  Nobody, but they're saying I did.  You know what I mean?  Who are they saying you beat up?  A car and some, you know, some threats,  and they were in fear and this and that,  but really I didn't do anything.  It was just a setup so they could have me removed by the police  so they could do their own thing or whatever without getting caught. 
[00:16:00]  Now how long are you going away for?  Up to two years.  Oh!  Wade, you beat up some stuff pretty seriously if you're getting two years.  I didn't beat anybody up.  I really didn't, you know?  But what happened was they slapped me with a restraining order,  and that means I can't see my kids.  Right.  Yeah, so, you know, it was like a month before Christmas.  So I went over there in a rage, screaming like, you know,  what a bitch because now I can't see my kids for the holidays,  and that was a violation of a restraining order, 
[00:16:30]  and that's basically what I'm looking at.  Ouch.  Oof.  So that's basically my charge is, you know,  contempt of court and violation of the judge's orders and, you know, the whole bit.  Well, it's, I don't know.  We might have to let the listeners decide if we should give you the tickets or not, man.  That's fine.  If you go either way.  So when are you going?  Probably like a week after that concert.  Like March, early March?  Yeah.  And for how long?  Up to two years.  Up to two years. 
[00:17:00]  All right.  Hold on a sec.  Thank you, bro.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Hello.  Hey.  Hey, how's it going?  No, we got you on the line with somebody else.  Where's the other person?  I don't know.  No, it's not working.  That's stupid false.  Hmm.  I don't know, though, because if this guy,  now it's violence against your girl?  Well, that's what they said, yeah.  I don't know.  Unless we get the other side of the story. 
[00:17:30]  Too many stories.  You crazy bastards.  All of a sudden, you get the restraining order.  You go over and figure, if you won't love me, no one.  No one.  You'll have no one.  Hey, hold on right there.  Let me tell you something.  I don't want her back.  Who would want more of that?  You know what I mean?  You just want your kids.  Well, sure.  It's not fair to me.  Or them.  All right.  Hold on.  I'm going to see what the listeners think.  All right.  We like to do this stuff with our listeners.  Hmm.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, N.E.W.  Hey, N.E.W.  You think this guy deserves the Black Crows tickets? 
[00:18:00]  He deserves them as much as I do.  So you want him instead of him.  You're going to the joint?  No, I'm not going to the joint.  Well, listen, you know, he's going to the joint, so he deserves the concert more than me?  Well, he's not going to think about it.  Yeah, think about it.  He's going to be, like, you know, doing stuff that...  He sounds like a tough guy, but I don't know what he looks like.  Let me ask you a question, guys.  He might end up, after the Black Crows, being queen of the weight room prom.  You don't know.  That's what I mean.  We're trying to hook him up one last time before, you know...  Well, let me ask you a question.  What?  Is it my fault that he's going to the joint? 
[00:18:30]  No.  No.  So why should I lose the chance of getting tickets?  All right.  So you vote for no?  No.  Okay.  Thanks.  He votes for no.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  You can't curse.  You can't use those words.  He said, F, no.  Dude, it's not looking good.  One more try.  Hold on.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello?  Yeah, what do you think?  Does this guy deserve tickets before he goes into the joint for two years? 
[00:19:00]  You know, I think he does.  But I tell you what, he has to promise not to kick anyone's ass.  What, in the joint?  Yeah.  He might be getting his ass kicked.  Not in the joint.  Not in the joint.  The concert.  Oh, yeah, really?  That's true, too.  You can't go kick anyone's ass in the concert.  All right, man.  Thanks.  So, there's two no, one yes.  All right.  First one of three.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, yeah.  Why don't you give him those tickets?  Oh, you want to give it to him? 
[00:19:30]  Mm-hmm.  Why do you want to give it to him?  Because that bitch keeps his kids away from him.  That's not cool.  Well, all right.  That's a yes vote.  Hey, this lady thinks you should get the tickets, bro.  Bro.  Bro.  Ah.  Just tell him that.  All right.  We will.  Thanks.  Okay.  We used to be able to conference callers, but no more, I guess.  And now he just hung up on the convict.  Oh.  All right.  We'll try to take care of him.  We'll call back. 
[00:20:00]  All right.  Ah.  What a clusterf that was, man.  Damn.  We used to be able to conference callers, but for some reason we can't.  I don't know if he should be rewarded, Opie.  No.  Without any proof of, you know, we don't know what her side is.  We should get the lady on the phone as well.  Yeah.  I'd hate to give a wife abuser.  Right.  Any tickets.  Not saying that he is, but I don't know that he isn't.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, FU Friday with Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out for the ride home. 
[00:20:30]  There's a guy.  I think this is the one right here, hopefully.  Hi, NEW.  Hi.  Yeah.  What's up, guys?  What's up?  Nothing.  I want to give a big, fat FU to some chick that I don't even know her name.  Because listen to this.  I was on a business trip about a month ago.  I went to a bar, right?  I'm just an average-looking guy.  Met some girl.  I thought, wow, this is great.  Look at my luck, right?  Went back to her hotel room.  Everything went well.  Ended up hooking up with this girl.  Now I got general warts.  Nah.  Right?  I knew it was too good to be true. 
[00:21:00]  Because how often do you really go out and get laid, you know?  It always happens to the other guy.  And when it finally happens to me, you know?  Well, all right.  First of all, where were you?  Genital warts.  Do I have to say?  No.  But are you married or have a girlfriend back home?  No.  That's a good part.  I just broke up with my girlfriend recently.  So I'm like, yeah, I'm on the prowl.  And you know when you're out looking for it, you never get it.  This is the one night I was out looking for, and I actually got it.  You just grew in toads, you get genital warts, pal.  Was she really hot and stuff? 
[00:21:30]  That's just it.  She was hot, you know?  And I was like, oh.  Why didn't you wrap it?  It broke.  Oh, come on.  I don't even want to.  Don't BS us, pal.  Why didn't you wrap it?  I didn't feel like it.  I didn't.  Surgery.  I didn't bring any with me, because I really never thought, you know?  I didn't think I was going out and getting laid, you know?  So what do you do with genital warts?  I don't know.  Oh, God.  Because I went to my doctor, and he told me what I had.  And I was like, oh, shh.  Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh. 
[00:22:00]  How embarrassed were you when the doctor said you have genital warts?  Well, I mean, luckily I got tested for other crap, too, and everything came up all right.  But I had to laugh, you know?  I'm like, oh, God.  There's a lot of people laughing at you right now.  Trust me.  Genital warts.  Yeah, big F you.  It's a big F you, you know?  Next time wrap it, man.  What are you, crazy?  Oh, I know.  Yeah, you know, you can say that, but it's not always.  Exactly.  I mean, you can say that, but, you know, I mean, if you didn't have one with you, you'd  be doing the same thing I did.  No way.  No, no.  Nope, nope.  I'm saying it's not out of the realm of possibility that if you're out and you don't have one with 
[00:22:30]  you and the opportunity is there with a hot girl, you're just going to go, you know something?  Eee, let me just spin the wheel.  No, no way.  Would not do it.  I would have to.  No, just do some other stuff, man.  I'm too paranoid for that.  I'd be freaked out.  Well, now I am, too, you know?  Yeah, exactly.  You're lucky you got off with the genital warts.  I know.  I know.  Could have been a lot worse.  Yep.  Keep up the good work, guys.  You're making me laugh, at least.  I know. 
[00:23:00]  You just made everyone else laugh.  All right, man.  Later.  Bye.  Have a good weekend.  Keep that thing tucked away.  Oh, without a doubt.  All right.  We got the Barbie thing up on the website?  Yeah.  Yeah, I had to do some wheeling and dealing, but it's up there.  All right.  But, yeah, somebody, what, emailed you the Barbie and Ken?  Yeah, Barbie and Ken doing it video.  It's pretty funny.  Somebody did a little animation, used Barbie and Ken doll, and did one frame at a time and  animated them actually doing it.  Mm-hmm.  And if you want to check that video out, we have it up on the website. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, it's on the semi-live studio cam section of the Opie and Anthony part of the WNW  website.  We're going to have to change the name of that link, the semi-live studio cam, because  it's more than that now.  It's turning into more than that.  Yeah, it's just our part of the WNW website.  Yeah, stuff that any W doesn't want associated with their little website.  Honestly, I'd be surprised if this Barbie and Ken thing stays up through the weekend,  so you might want to check it out right away.  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  Right away.  Just click on our pictures through the WNW website and go to the semi-live studio cam. 
[00:24:00]  You'll find it from there, okay?  Right.  And speaking of the internet, where's Tara?  Tara's visiting us today.  Tara, hottest girl to ever pose naked on the Opie and Anthony show.  And we promised that we'd take some brand new pictures of her.  Better pictures, yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know who's going to take these pictures.  Do we have a better camera?  Do we have...  She was in the bathroom.  She was in the bathroom.  Whoa.  Wow, Tara.  Look at you looking cute today. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, Tara.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Yeah, you weren't crunching in that bathroom, were you?  No, thank you.  Do you like that nasty facts in front of you?  Ew.  Isn't that gross?  Does that look like Mendy?  Well, did you have fun Friday, first of all?  Yeah, I had a great time.  Yeah.  I had a really good time.  Did you take a breeze to that magazine, that Big Butt Mendy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Pretty sick.  We've been hanging with Mendy for a while.  She's been sending her Big Butt magazines for a while.  Yeah.  You know, there are guys that get really turned on by that stuff. 
[00:25:00]  Really?  By the Big Butts and stuff.  Yeah.  Like the big marshmallow butt.  I just look at it as like a freak of nature.  I'm not sexually turned on by that, you know?  At one point, she went to sit on my leg when I was sitting on the stool.  It felt like a bunch of pizza dough in my lap.  I swear to God.  I swear, because I've never been a chub chaser, so I never had the pleasure of grabbing onto  the huge ass. 
[00:25:30]  But when she sat on my leg, it was like, like just this squishy, big, fat ass.  Can't get into that.  Well, the email went nuts.  There's a bunch of guys that want her home number and stuff.  They're really into Mendy and her big ass.  Chubby chases.  Are we out there?  We got pictures on our website of her as well.  Yeah.  And if you find the hidden link, you'll get to see Mendy getting spanked.  So hidden.  What happened to the rest of them?  The rest of the pictures?  Yeah.  Like the...  We're still...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Well, there's some that were too blurry and other ones. 
[00:26:00]  We're still uploading some stuff.  We might end up putting some AVI's on there.  Yeah.  Believe me.  We're getting a hold of the video.  I want to put some video up and take some snappies off of the video.  Yes.  So that's unlimited photographs.  So I think we'll be adding pictures for the next, I don't know, year.  Year.  From our party last Friday.  Still the next party.  We have that much stuff.  Yeah.  But Tara came in because we want to take some more pictures of you because she was just  not happy with the pictures we took in the studio last time.  No.  And if she's going to be hottest girl ever to pose naked on the Opie and Anthony show, 
[00:26:30]  she wants to be represented better.  Right.  So she's going to give another shot today.  That's legit.  So what do you got for us today?  All sorts of nice stuff.  I brought, actually, yeah, about like three or...  I don't know, like five or six outfits.  Really?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  Bravo.  Be cool.  And honestly, we don't have your next challenger yet.  No one has come forth.  I know.  What is that, man?  I think the girls are a little scared, you know?  Checking it out.  We're still waiting for another lady to step forward to, you know, take on Tara.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, I was surprised with the vote. 
[00:27:00]  She beat Spike.  It was like 5,500 to 3,800 around there.  Yeah.  Tara won over Spike, so...  She's cool.  And we'll get another challenger eventually.  Yeah.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York, Sugar Ray, every morning.  Those guys play in Roseland tonight.  If you're going to the show, make sure you say hi to Black Earl.  He'll be out front in the WNEW van.  Yes.  When people stop by to say hi.  Yes, he does.  Will Ben the Fag be with him as well?  Well, they are that roaming comedy thing. 
[00:27:30]  Mutt and Jeff.  Mutt and Jeff.  They hang together all the time.  Rick and Frack.  Everlast playing tonight as well, Roseland.  Tickets still available, I believe, if you're looking for something to do tonight.  It's Opie and Anthony, and we got Tara in the studio.  Hottest girl to ever pose naked on the Opie and Anthony show.  We promised her that we would take another batch of pictures, because she just didn't think  the batch you took last time, Anthony.  Yeah.  We're flattering pictures.  I understand.  So, a flattering pic, whatever.  Flattering.  But she's got two bags of lingerie and stuff, and she's going to put on some outfits. 
[00:28:00]  Not even just lingerie.  She's got some cool little, like, boxer things that are cut.  What is that?  What is that gray thing?  It's a...  Let me see that.  Hold that up.  Oh, wow.  That's tiny.  Joe Boxer.  Nice.  I think that, right?  Yeah, we can handle that.  Well, what outfit do you want to put on first, man?  Well, the one I have on now is pretty cool.  Yeah, it is.  I'm going to do that one.  It's a thong, too, so...  Wow, okay.  Yeah, that works.  All right.  Anthony got a better camera, so...  Yes.  So, we'll have the camera.  We'll see what happens with these pictures. 
[00:28:30]  I hope you like these better, Tara.  Fuzzy Logic.  Yeah.  I'll hold steady.  And the lighting's a little better in the studio.  You noticed that, right?  Yes.  Okay.  There we go.  We'll figure out how to turn it on, but...  I wish I could figure out how to put these headphones on the way and hit my head.  Well, those headphones are goofy.  And we're still looking for the next challenger for Tara.  If you think you got what it takes to take on Tara as the hottest girl to ever pose naked  on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah.  You got to get a hold of us.  All right?  All right.  Well, while Tara gets ready there, we still got a ton of FUs coming in here, Anthony. 
[00:29:00]  Sal from Staten Island wants to send an FU out to the guy that had his small intestine  attached to his throat on the shocking medical video show last night.  Was that heinous?  Well, you still think that was the sickest video from last night's show, right?  I couldn't take him pushing the food down like that.  It just...  Yeah.  If you weren't...  If you didn't see the show last night, it was the best show I've seen in freaking years.  I'm sure they'll run it again.  They got to. 
[00:29:30]  Tara, did you see it?  I was working.  Oh.  That was disgusting.  Well, this guy wanted to kill himself, so he drank poison.  He drank some kind of industrial cleaner, like kind of Drano stuff.  Right.  And how did he not die?  I don't know, because he was all screwed up on booze and he walked out of his house and  fell down.  But what had happened is it ate away his esophagus and stomach and part of his intestine.  Yeah.  So they had to feed him intravenously.  For three years.  And went through a tube into his intestine.  Yeah.  Until they figured, well, because his throat, if he swallowed, it just stopped. 
[00:30:00]  Like there was nothing.  It didn't go through.  Right.  So, ew.  They hooked up his small intestine.  Right to his throat.  Right to his throat.  But it was outside his rib cage, just under the skin, over his chest.  So when he ate, it looked like an anaconda.  Just ate a rabbit.  And it would just...  And he'd have to push the...  Food down.  He would have to help push the food down.  Like a toothpaste tube.  You know?  And then he only had three or four minutes after he ate before he had to go to the bathroom. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, because his digestive tract was so small.  Unless he ate potatoes, then they said it was six to seven minutes.  Potatoes, yeah, it was seven minutes.  That's great.  Yeah.  How did he get the nutrients?  Like, you know what I mean?  Yeah, well, he had to eat a lot.  Like, he was eating every hour.  He'd have to eat six to ten times a day, something like that, just to get enough nutrients.  And you've got to figure, ugh, it would probably come out like it went in.  Yeah.  But the footage was great.  He's just pushing with his fingers like this, all the way down.  And then we got another F.U. for two-headed Chang. 
[00:31:00]  An F.U. for two-headed Chang?  Why?  Well, that...  Poor Chang.  See, that was the sickest video by far last night.  Chang had another face, or half a face, or part of a face growing out of the side of his face.  Yeah.  It was a mouth with some gnarly teeth.  Twelve teeth.  Some weird little eye socket thing going on.  And a forehead.  And a forehead with this tuft of hair on his cheek.  It was the sickest thing.  It looked like...  Didn't it look like a putting green?  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  It was stuck on his face.  You think he gets a groovy hairstyle on the second face?  Yeah, maybe he can moose it up a little bit.  Like, he could go with the dry look on his regular head, and then, like, moose up the head on his side.  And every time he smiles, his second face would smile along with him.  Yeah, his mouth would move together.  That was disturbing.  I can't believe you didn't think that was the sickest video last night.  And in China, they have arranged marriages in this village that he lived in.  And they were telling the story of how his arranged marriage, his wife showed up at the village, 
[00:32:00]  and they had never met before, because it's arranged.  And she took one look at him and ran away.  She just ran off.  Poor Chang couldn't even marry his arranged...  Have his arranged wedding.  And then they took his second face off, and he looked just as stupid.  You know, at least he had an excuse the first time.  I could pressure you and reave a hickey on your thigh at the same time.  Eat romaine and egg roll at the same time. 
[00:32:30]  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hi.  I saw that video with the guy with the intestine yesterday.  I almost lost my dinner.  Isn't that sick?  I'm telling you, seeing him push that stuff down...  Ugh.  Just now, when you were describing it, I was gagging.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Now, was that the sickest video you saw last night on that show?  I called my wife, and I told her, don't put on the television.  She was upstairs.  Don't put on...  So what'd she do?  She puts the television on, and she starts screaming at me, because I told her to... 
[00:33:00]  Because she put it on!  Yeah.  It was sick.  It was great.  It was great TV last night.  And I was saying, why don't they just run the small intestine on the inside?  Why do they have to put it on top of the guy's rib cage, in between his ribs and his skin?  And they said, because he had infections in the past, they had tried other things, and...  His body rejected it.  Yeah.  Well, they figured they would just run it on the outside, in case there was a problem  they could get to it really fast.  I don't know what the deal was.  But that was amazing.  Fox has reached new lows, guys. 
[00:33:30]  Of course, and I'll watch every single show, to be honest with you.  Exactly every single show.  Yeah.  I mean, the Guinness Book of World Records, they're going to have a guy live, trying to set  the record, being on fire for the longest time next week.  Pretty soon, Frasier and Niles will be doing operations on themselves, to get the ratings  back.  Screw the sitcoms.  Well, did you see what Regis was doing this morning?  No.  Regis was mud wrestling with a chick.  Swear to God.  I was watching, going, wait, is this Regis or Jerry? 
[00:34:00]  You know?  It's like the old Richard Bay show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a good show.  And Regis was, like, beating the crap out of this girl.  Really?  He was putting her in a headlock and flipping her over on the ground?  Like, not...  He was roughhousing her.  Mm-hmm.  I think he was liking it.  She was in a bikini.  All right, man.  Well, thank you.  Guys, thanks a lot.  You're doing a great job.  Hey, thank you.  All right.  So long.  Everyone knows what it takes to get some ratings on TV.  You've got to be sensational.  Mm-hmm.  You've got to have the shock value.  And it's got to be simple.  And people are tuning in these shows in record numbers, so keep them a-coming. 
[00:34:30]  You know what happens?  You don't have to sit there at the beginning and wait for commercials to go to the kitchen  and get something and pay attention and two hours and three, six-hour miniseries.  These are shows you could pop on around the channel and go, oh, I'm stopping right here.  Yeah.  Halfway through.  It doesn't matter.  Well, you see that on TV.  Where are you going?  Nowhere.  You flipping through that?  You see Two-Headed Chang.  What are you going to do?  You're staying to see more.  Right.  No.  No, you want to see more of Two-Headed Chang. 
[00:35:00]  Two-Headed Chang.  That was...  Oh, you should see a two-butted wang.  He ribbed next door.  All right.  Well, Tara's getting ready.  We're going to take some more photos of her and put it on our website, hopefully by the end of the day.  Yeah.  Yeah, we've got to do...  I think we've got to do these rather quickly.  Yeah.  Because Scott Colombo's got to pop them on the computer.  All right.  We'll do it while the commercials are playing.  All right.  All right.  So Tara's stripping as we speak.  What does she have on?  Whoa, what is that?  Wow. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  I'm not going to a commercial.  That's very, very nice.  Take your headphones off.  Okay.  Those are better than the underwears you were wearing that day.  Oh, see, she came prepared for the photo shoot today.  Wow.  Wow.  Let's just do one like that on the chair.  Hold on.  I've got to learn how to drive this camera.  Okay.  That is an amazing shot right there.  That's not my camera, but wow.  Let me...  I guarantee that shot will be better than anyone you did last time, Anthony.  Wow, that's a good one.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  We usually play that on Tuesday nights for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  That's our pal Red Peters.  And below me, it's Sophie and Anthony and Tara hanging in the studio,  putting on another outfit for us.  We're taking another set of photographs for her because we promised that we would do that  because she didn't like the first batch we took.  Better camera.  She's got little outfits she brought in.  She's prepared.  I've been snapping away like crazy.  Yeah, she's prepared this time.  Oh, my God.  She's changing.  Totally.  Whoa.  Hello.  Whoa.  Whoa. 
[00:36:30]  Whoa.  You just distracted us, man.  What's up with that?  How's it?  Damn.  Wow.  Look at that.  That's a beautiful bathing suit.  That's nice.  Very nice.  Let me get that.  Hold on.  Anthony's distracted.  He's been taking pictures for the last 40 minutes.  Okay.  Come on.  There it is.  Perfect.  What do you got?  I've got to make sure the shot is right.  That's fine.  What do you got, man?  Yo, man.  Check this out.  How did you guys play Blow Me during Lent on a Friday when a girl can't eat meat?  Come on.  Take after you to Lent during Friday. 
[00:37:00]  On a Friday.  Come on.  All right.  You make a good point.  Oh, man.  Come on.  All right.  I can't even get a good Hummer on Friday during Lent.  That's pretty funny.  Thanks.  You guys rock, man.  Great.  Have a great weekend.  You too, man.  All right.  Hi, N.E.W.  This is Two-Face Chang.  Two-Face Chang checking in from last night's shocking medical video show from Fox.  I make a lot of money at Two-Face Chang.  I work at a Chinese Japanese steakhouse.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I flip many burgers and many Szechuan chocolate chicken. 
[00:37:30]  And lots of pork.  Everyone thinks they're...  One half of pork.  Two-Face Chang eats pork and chicken at the same time.  Amazing.  I talk to people on one side, flip chicken to the other side of the table.  My other mouth, my teeth look like a bunch of wontons.  I had stuff in mouth.  Oh, we have wonton soup, a fresh garden salad.  See him?  Yeah.  He had that.  It wasn't even really a mouth.  I don't know what that was.  Well, he had 12 teeth in the side of his face. 
[00:38:00]  It was a vagina.  It was like a beak.  Oh, look.  All right, man.  Later.  Later.  The guy just had to get out of control.  Everyone's trying to do the Yoshi voice.  I like that.  Mark from Jersey.  He's got an F.U.  I want to send a big F.U.  to Sue, a girl from work that I dated years ago.  She dumped me and made it crystal clear that I should get out of her life.  She then proceeds to follow me to the gym, to concerts, and other places.  She sleeps with my friends and then spies on me.  She's now doing this psycho stalker thing with hang-up phone calls and bogus beeper messages. 
[00:38:30]  Stay out of my effing life, you lunatic.  Thank you, guys.  Keep on rocking.  Tara's really hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.  All right.  There you go.  Two-Face Chang can give a hummer and say, I love you at the same time.  Yeah, there's a couple.  I don't think I can find their instant feedback fast enough here.  Oh, the black's very nice.  Yeah.  But what is that, purple?  Let me see.  Where's your pretty gone?  That is black.  Oh, that is very nice. 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  Yeah, the guys and girls are going to love that one.  That's a good one.  I like when I get up there.  What, up there?  Oh, yeah.  You get up there.  Sure.  You can get up there.  Yeah, you get up there.  Yes, you get up there.  Let's move all this stuff.  Oh, she just spilled the water all over her lingerie.  Did she?  That's okay.  No, actually, I should go over that one.  That's strategic.  Hey, before you leave, can you take, you know, you've got to be completely naked and sit on every chair in the studio.  Trust me, it'll drive someone nuts around here.  I'm serious. 
[00:39:30]  Who would that drive nuts?  I can't say now.  We're not allowed to talk.  We're not allowed to mention that person's name anymore.  That's all right.  We need a few paper towelettes.  Put water.  All right, here comes Kevin, our intern.  Before it goes into any of the works.  Is that what he is?  He's an intern?  Is that why he's running around like a lunatic?  Well, yeah, but he wants to get in radio.  He does a great job for us.  And look, look at the perks.  We do a great job for him.  Look at this little ditty he gets to sit through.  Yeah, look at the perks he gets. 
[00:40:00]  Anyway, while they clean up the table, there's a couple.  They were so bummed they missed our talk on the Shockey Medical videos.  They were looking forward to us talking about it all day, and we did it earlier,  and they're bummed.  Sorry.  We want to know what you guys thought of Two-Headed Chang.  We've been talking about Two-Headed Chang, though, the whole show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, Terry, get up on that table.  All right, let's see.  Let's see what this is.  Oh, everyone else out of the picture.  Yeah, the pictures.  Yeah, move the mic.  The pictures aren't the same when you have a bunch of dorky guys in the background. 
[00:40:30]  It's like you've got Hot Tara in the picture, and Ben the Fag is in the background.  Well, sitting like that's a good start.  Oh, wow, yeah, yeah, with the leg hanging over.  Wow.  Wow, that's great.  That's pretty good.  She's prepared today.  Yeah, totally.  I think the guys and girls are going to love these pictures even more than the first batch.  I'm going to have to do it that way.  Here, let me move this.  Hold on.  Be patient.  You've got to get the right shot.  Wow.  That's a great shot. 
[00:41:00]  That's an unbelievable shot.  Hit it.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on, please.  There it is.  All right.  We're going to try to get these pictures up before 7-8.  Yeah, I've got to get this camera into...  Is that velvet, by the way?  Velvet bra and panties?  Mm-hmm.  Very nice.  All right.  You should do one of those good, like, what do they call those?  Very artsy shots.  Maybe on the couch.  Out in the thing.  Like a...  What's that go?  Yeah.  No, we're like... 
[00:41:30]  First of all, ace the bra and the bottom thing, but you have your leg kind of curled up and  you're kind of...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but we're going to do it out there on the couch.  Yeah, but out there.  Now that's rock and roll, kiddies.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Soundgarden, Rusty Cage from Bad Motor Finger.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Chris Cornell, one of the best singers out there, I think, in my opinion.  Without a doubt.  Well, Anthony, our spies here at NEW did well for us once again.  What do we have? 
[00:42:00]  What do we have?  I got in my hand, or I should say I have in my hand, a FCC complaint letter going to the  FCC.  How'd you get that?  With lawyers and everything involved.  Come on.  I'm serious.  Let me see.  Totally serious.  Look, there's the lawyer's name at the top.  Don't want to give them any airtime.  But what is...  Oh, a lawyer is complaining?  I believe so.  Or this lady went through a lawyer.  Why would you go to a lawyer to voice your complaint?  February 19th, 1999, this is going to the FCC, Federal Communications Commission, Complaints 
[00:42:30]  Department, referring NEW's Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  I knew it was just a matter of time before you start getting in trouble again.  What does this busy body have a problem with?  Well, I guess this lady talked to our boss, and that's where the letter starts off.  As per the telephone conversation I had with your organization, I have attached pictures  from the WNEW website.  Oh, no.  This is after she talked to the FCC.  Oh, great.  It's even worse. 
[00:43:00]  As per the telephone conversation I had with your organization, I have attached pictures  from the WNEW website.  These pictures are from the live broadcast and illustrate the content and context of  the Opie and Anthony show on Friday, February 12th, 1999.  You will note that in one of these pictures, Mendy sits on and straddles Twinkies while wearing  thong underwear.  Is this serious?  Swear to God this is serious.  This lady FCC'd everybody, including the mayor. 
[00:43:30]  Wait, mayor who?  The mayor.  Giuliani?  Yes.  Get out of here.  Freaking CC'd the mayor, all our advertisers.  She included the photos from our website.  Oh, brother.  Which, by the way, has nothing to do with the WNEW website.  Of course.  All right.  You will note that in one of these pictures, Mendy sits on and straddles Twinkies while wearing  thong underwear.  This was described in detail by Opie and Anthony on the air, immediately after which they asked  the audience if anyone wanted a lick. 
[00:44:00]  Did we do that?  I am offended.  This was also the context and content of Opie and Anthony's conversation when they started  talking about playing with the ladies, wah-wah, a few minutes later.  I don't think we talked about it.  The P word.  We didn't say that.  They did an impression of Popeye's voice saying how he loved to play with olive oil's  pusky all night long.  Wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah-wah.  What's the fence give about a pusky?  By anyone's standards, I believe that this would be considered indecent. 
[00:44:30]  Anyone's.  No, yours, you bitch.  Especially as it was being broadcast at approximately 4.30 in the afternoon.  At that hour, the major listening audience of a rock station would be children and teenagers.  As most adults, including the parents of these children, are still at work.  Oh, please.  If by some chance this isn't indecent and inappropriate enough for children and teenagers to be listening  to, there is much more.  For example, on Wednesday, February 10th, 1999.  Great long-time listener here, huh? 
[00:45:00]  This lady has heard every single show since we started.  Opie and Anthony had a woman named Spike at the studio.  They asked her to strip for them in the studio and to pose in various pornographic poses,  completely naked, while they took pictures of her that they posted on the Internet.  They described what she was taking off, her body parts in detail, her poses, and what parts  they were photographing at the moment.  We got to hear all of their lewd reactions, jeers, and comments as this was going on.  Oh!  Oh!  My God! 
[00:45:30]  What's the problem here?  She also CC'd the NWACP.  NWACP?  Uh-oh.  And now, great.  We've already had a lot of problems.  Every great...  Is PETA...  Is PETA...  Did PETA get CC'd?  Hey, lady, when you write your next letter, I think otters should be stepped on.  There, now CC PETA with that one.  Uh, National Organization of Women, Reverend Al Sharpton with CC'd.  Come on, now stop it.  The mayor...  Reverend Al Sharpton, I swear to you, they've got this letter, too. 
[00:46:00]  Toyota...  I am out raged!  Toyota, Disney...  All right, uh, going on with this lady's letter.  They told the audience that this was a contest.  Evidently, another woman named Tara had done the same thing at an earlier date.  And that the pictures would be posted on the internet for the listeners to look at and vote on who had the best body.  Mm-hmm.  At this time, they also began mocking a man in the studio who, they said, locked himself in another room because he didn't want to be part of this scene and didn't want to be photographed with Spike. 
[00:46:30]  Uh-oh.  Spike had chains and whips, and they claimed the man, who they described as black, didn't want to come out because he was afraid of whips and chains because his ancestors were slaving.  And he had watched Roots.  Now, Earl's in the studio.  This is the writings of a mad woman.  Now, Earl's in the studio.  What's her name?  What's her name?  Uh, Marianne.  Marianne.  I won't give the last name because then she'll sue me.  Marianne.  Marianne.  Marianne.  Get a grip, Marianne. 
[00:47:00]  Number one.  Number two.  Kind of liked it.  School.  Yeah.  That's when I become a client.  Black girl, by the way.  And you were the one who said the Roots comment.  I made the Roots comment.  The black guy said the Roots comment.  All right, anyway.  All right, settle down, Marianne.  All right, let's move on with the letter here.  Afraid of whips and chains because his ancestors were slaves and he had watched Roots.  They dragged him out, handcuffed him, took pictures of him being whipped by Spike and dedicated the next song, Black Dog, to him.  Boy, she was paying attention. 
[00:47:30]  Well, we did.  Okay, that's all true.  But it just so happened the next song was Black Dog.  What can I tell you?  I'm the king of segs.  What can I say?  Oh, my God.  Finally, on many occasions, including Tuesday, February 16th, 1999.  Uh-oh, Tuesday.  What could this cov be?  At approximately 4.30 p.m., they gave out the address of pornographic and nude websites over the air and encouraged listeners to check them out.  No, that was the top listing for Flash Mountain. 
[00:48:00]  Yeah, yeah, Flash Mountain.  Oh, yeah, we'll give out their website again.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, it's FlashMountain.com.  FlashMountain.com.  www.  Bunch of girls that flash at Disney when they're going down the flume ride.  That was the day I won.  That was the day I gave.  Yeah, that's very funny.  FlashMountain.com.  FlashMountain.com.  FlashMountain.com.  Marion.  On February 16th, 1999, specifically, they gave out the address and then logged onto the site themselves and described over the air what they were seeing.  Oh, my God.  I've made several attempts to contact the station manager, Mr. W-W-W-W-W at WNEW, but he is never available and does not return my phone calls. 
[00:48:30]  Join the club.  As far as I'm concerned, I am trying to raise my children with a basic respect for others, including all races and sexes.  Here it is, the raising of the children portion.  I certainly do not want them impressed with this image of sex, this treatment of women, and such disrespect for other races.  I wasn't offended.  By any standards, these broadcasts are indecent and inappropriate, and if you have any other questions, please give me a call. 
[00:49:00]  Sincerely, Marianne.  By any standards.  No, by your standards, that you're now trying to push on everybody else, Marianne.  Marianne.  What credentials does Marianne have that she can judge for everybody else what they should listen to?  Marianne knows what makes good parents.  Marianne knows what people should listen to.  So let's put Marianne in charge of everything. 
[00:49:30]  We'll run Barney 24 hours a day, and the world will be a marvelous place with no crime or hatred or anything,  because Barney will be running 24 hours a day.  And simple as this, Marianne, if people aren't being entertained by the Opie and Anthony show, there's something called ratings.  We don't get ratings.  We're gone.  We're out of here.  But if the people are enjoying the show, then so be it.  Let them enjoy this.  And there's a knob on the radio, too.  Right.  You can turn it on.  You can turn it off.  She has all the pictures from the website.  She's got Spike spanking the guy from our party. 
[00:50:00]  Like the knobs on our website.  Look at the picture of this.  There's knobs on the radio you can turn.  Oh, wow.  She's got the Twinkie picture.  Yeah, she's got the pictures of Mendy sitting on the Twinkies.  This all went to the FCC, so.  You know what?  I don't think the FCC has anything to do with regulating the Internet right now.  Hey, that might change.  And these pictures aren't on the WNEW website, because the school pigeon that works here at  NEW told on us on that one, so.  Well, isn't there, like, a restriction area for, like, kids if she doesn't want her kids 
[00:50:30]  to see that?  Then she should do her parenting and not let her kids go on the computer.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, I've been waiting.  I've been waiting to talk to these guys.  We're live on the air.  What do you got?  Marianne is out of her mind.  Hey, does she know how to make her husband happy?  Ah, probably not.  Come on.  I would say, in my opinion, from reading this letter, probably not.  Probably not a member of the Tuesday Night Homer Club.  No.  Definitely not.  You guys have an educational program here. 
[00:51:00]  We're just trying to have fun, make people laugh after a long, hard day of work.  Simple as that.  It annoys me when people try to put their morality on everyone else, because they're offended  by something, or something might even excite them and titillate them, and that upsets them.  So they want it wiped out and taken off.  Instead of, like we were saying, radio is something you can turn off, you know?  True.  So turn it off, Marianne.  Don't put your little ideas on everybody else.  Maybe people enjoy hearing about a fat girl's butt sitting on a Twinkie and a guy licking 
[00:51:30]  it off.  That's pretty entertaining.  To tell you the truth, I would listen.  If I wasn't doing it on the air here, if we weren't presenting it, I'd be listening to  it on the drive home.  So there he is.  These crazy people are trying to take away our constitutional rights in a world where  we desperately need them.  Exactly.  So I would strongly suggest that anyone that does like the Opie and Anthony show, there's  a feedback section on the WNEW website.  Please go there and tell them what you like about the show. 
[00:52:00]  Because now we're going to have to get all our material together for the FCC.  We've been through this millions of times in the past.  It's a pain in the ass.  Maybe Marianne was a little, she got a little titillated with those pictures.  I'm saying perhaps this could happen.  Is this possible, Opie?  Very possible.  Maybe she was looking at Mendy sitting on the Twinkie.  Maybe Marianne was thinking, oh, I would like to taste that Twinkie.  I'd like a little taste.  I'd like to lick the cream, lick the cream out of that cellulite crater. 
[00:52:30]  She'd drop her Mooma once in a while and sit on a package of hosts and she might be a  lot happier.  That's right.  All right, she doesn't like this bit either, so I want to play it on the air.  Which one?  I don't know.  Let's see.  Oh, man.  Screw her.  Yeah.  Marianne's thinking, hmm, I want to be a Twinkie.  I want Mendy to sit on me.  And to our spies at NW, thank you very much for getting this letter.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  That's whole celebrity skin, whole play with Marilyn Manson, April 6th, Continental Arena. 
[00:53:00]  And on the 7th of April at Nassau Coliseum, tickets go on sale tomorrow morning.  At 10 a.m.  Hey, O&A, I want to send a big F for you to Marianne or whoever wrote that letter to you.  And also, I love your show.  From Ian X in Staten Island.  Thank you.  Another email from Tom in Huntington points out an interesting thing.  As per the claimer, tell Marianne she's not supposed to be distributing those pictures.  Reproduction or distribution as per our disclaimer.  Right.  See line three of the disclaimer. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  All right.  We've got to give away some Black Crowes tickets.  We like to give the tickets to our faithful listeners, not the fringe listeners.  No.  I mean, you know, hopefully you fringe listeners will start becoming full-time listeners eventually.  But we do want to take care of the people that have been with us for a while.  Yes.  So we do Opie and Anthony trivia.  Tell you the truth, this one, this question I got only goes back about a month.  Yeah.  So you got a pretty good shot at it.  Give us a call right now.  212-757-1027. 
[00:54:00]  The question is, what did Anthony do in high school to make some extra money?  Yes.  To make some extra money, Anthony did something in high school.  It was a little bizarre, I guess you would say.  A little, I was being creative.  Definitely not the obvious.  Don't say, you know, was he selling drugs?  You know, that's the obvious.  No.  This is kind of twisted.  It was a service.  I will say that.  And you admitted to this when Louis Black was on the show with us, I believe? 
[00:54:30]  I think so.  Just to give people a little help there.  All right?  Yeah.  All right.  Really fast.  I got to send this FU out from Sandy.  Hey, guys, I want to send a big FU out to all the lazy-ass people who still have their  Christmas decorations up and a real big FU to the idiot moron's house I pass by every  day who has the nerve to still light up their tree and decorations.  It's absurd already.  Keep up the great work, you guys.  I've seen that.  Take the Christmas decorations down.  That's Sandy in Jersey. 
[00:55:00]  They had a story on the news about a pit bull that attacked some people and stuff.  And they shot it with a tranquilizer and the dog died and stuff.  So they went to the dog's owner's house and she was talking through the crack in the  doorway.  Yeah.  And she had her big, huge Christmas wreath still up on the door.  Really?  I mean, what is it?  It's February 19th.  Quickly, another FU.  Big FU to those a-holes in Midtown who have those large golf umbrellas.  Oh, I saw this yesterday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:55:30]  When it rains and they refuse to move out of the way while they're walking super slow.  God, I hate those jerks.  Well, thanks, guys, for letting me vent.  And thanks for keeping me smiling while I slave away here at work.  You guys are doing a great job.  Well, that's the famous, you know, I'm the most important person in the world.  Yeah, we've noticed, I'm sure all you have, too, that most of the people on this planet  think they are the most important person on the face of the earth.  They are the only person and should not be inconvenienced for anybody.  You'll notice you'll be driving behind them. 
[00:56:00]  Left lane.  And they are doing 40 miles an hour.  And they have open highway ahead of them.  Open highway in front of them.  And they won't look in the mirror.  You know something?  If I'm in the left lane and I see no one in front of me, I automatically look behind me  to see if somebody maybe wants to go faster than I am.  Yeah.  But these people are the most important people on the face of the earth.  So they don't look.  The people in the supermarket that put the shopping cart in the middle of the aisle  and then stand next to it as they're looking for their groceries. 
[00:56:30]  And I'm standing there with the cart and I'm looking going,  well, don't you know other people are shopping?  No.  Other people want to get their cart through?  No.  Most important person on the face of the earth.  They don't care.  No.  The person that has to pick all their numbers at the counter.  Their lottery tickets.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, not just one or two.  Let's say 200 numbers.  And you're sitting behind them and you just want to buy one lousy paper?  Give me the 2, 3, 5 box.  Give me the 7, 8, 9.  Give me the 4, 8 with the 6 box stat. 
[00:57:00]  Reverse.  3, 6, 9, 4, 10.  Yeah.  I want a pack of gum, you bastard.  A pack of gum.  Yeah, look behind you, man.  I got a Daily News and two quarters in my hand.  Just say, oh, here, you want to go ahead of me real fast?  No.  Of course not.  All right, let's get the answer for the Black Crows tickets.  All right, so the question again.  What did Anthony do to make some extra money when he was in high school?  In high school.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, calling for the Black Crows tickets?  Yeah, you're live on the radio, so turn down your radio because we're on delay. 
[00:57:30]  No curse.  No problem.  All right, what's the answer to the question?  Take a lucky guess, man.  I don't know.  You got guys' dates?  No.  No.  I figured I'd be wrong.  Oh, you thought he was a pimp?  I don't know.  You never know, man.  Yeah, you never know listening to this show, but no.  Can I get tickets anyway?  Unfortunately not this time, man.  Sorry.  Greg, thanks.  All right.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey.  Hi, you got an answer to the question?  Yes.  He used to do pregnancy tests in his closet.  Yes!  Wow! 
[00:58:00]  Bravo!  What's your name?  My name is Holly.  Hi, Holly.  Where are you?  Actually, Garden State Parkway at 101B.  How's the traffic tonight?  Sucks.  I know.  Well, that's why we don't do traffic on the show because it sucks every night.  Especially Friday.  You know, the radio stations that do traffic, it's just a waste of time.  People know when it sucks or when it's good.  Exactly.  You know?  Wow.  She actually got it.  Very, very good.  You guys are great.  I have to say, can I do an F you out to Mary Ann?  I can tell her to get off her cross because somebody else needs the wood. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah, she's...  Thank you.  I like that one.  Yeah, thank you.  She's going to wreck it for everyone.  It always happens to us, but we'll see what happens.  But, Holly, thanks.  You got the Black Crows tickets.  Beauty it.  And Anthony has to explain this again really fast here.  All right.  Cool.  Back in the hallowed halls of John H. Glenn in Elwood, where I was attending high school,  part-time.  Didn't we all?  Yeah.  Sometimes the girls would get in a little nervous. 
[00:59:00]  They'd get a little nervous if they missed their period.  And back, this was, God, late 70s, early 80s.  Right.  So...  You're dating yourself, guys.  Yeah, well, what the hell?  We're young, trust me, compared to what they had here.  I slept back.  Yeah, and the girls would get a little nervous that they were pregnant, and the EPT pregnancy  test used to be a bitch.  It wasn't just, you know, whiz on a stick and wait for a plus or minus.  This was like, you know, I'm like Simon Barsinister.  Where are my test tubes? 
[00:59:30]  Bring me the urine.  So you'd have to set these things up for three hours in a very still place.  Like, you couldn't move it, and it had to be kept in dark, cool area.  And most of the girls couldn't just, you know, risk their mom walking in on them while they're  doing this test.  So, uh, I would do the test.  They would come over to your pad.  They would have to buy the test.  Yep.  And, uh, pay me, uh, 20 bucks.  And hand over the little vial of urine. 
[01:00:00]  And I would do the test for them in my closet.  And, uh, come back with the results.  Dr. Anthony.  I also did pap smears.  Yeah, weekend gynecology.  Yes.  I was an aspiring gyno.  Now, how many girls came to you?  I think, uh, in my career, I've, I've got, I had to be over 10.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Man.  They weren't screwing in my school.  It worked good.  In your career?  I must say, the way I thought of the idea was, I was the first to use it.  It was like, oh, Dan. 
[01:00:30]  And then I thought, wow, what a pain in the ass.  What if somebody can't do this at their house?  Where would you put it?  You know, out in the woods?  Now, how did you advertise?  Oh, word of mouth.  Word of mouth got around school?  Yeah, yeah.  Once I, you know, because you had to tell everyone, yeah, I had to do the test, and it came up negative, thank God.  Yeah.  Then someone would come to me and go, what test was that, man?  My girls kind of, you know.  Like, yeah, and then the girls would come to me, and then I would do the, do the test.  Did you get any dates out of this?  Uh, no, no.  See, and my, and, uh, my, my dean in, and John Glenn, Pete Polina, said I wasn't amounting to anything in that school. 
[01:01:00]  Yes, I was, Pete.  You're making some very scared people real happy.  All right, Holly.  What, you guys?  All right, hold on the line.  We're going to get info from you for the Black Crows tickets.  Cool, thanks.  Congratulations, and thanks for listening.  Have a great weekend.  You too.  All right.  There's someone that pays attention.  That's good.  Very good.  All right.  Robin Syosset writes, he's got a good one, F18 wheelers on the LIE that think no one wants to cross the center lane from the left lane to get off. 
[01:01:30]  The trucks line up like four in a row and form a wall.  F-ing blows.  God, that is so true.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got a problem with that guy.  That is true, though.  No, you're in the left lane?  Yeah.  You want to cross over to the right lane?  Yeah.  Why are there trucks next to you?  You should be way past them.  I swear to God.  No, because I hate the people in the left lane that are doing the same speed as the trucks.  As the trucks.  Now I'm trapped.  Or the people that, I love the people that are afraid of the rigs, so they stay right at the rear quarter of the truck in the left lane the whole time because they don't want to pass it. 
[01:02:00]  Meanwhile, that's probably the most dangerous place to be.  Pass the damn thing.  Basically, if you're in the furthest left lane, you should be, like, going 200 miles an hour.  It should be that if you're in the left lane and anyone's behind you, get out of the way.  Anyone.  So the lane should be reserved for people doing 150.  150, that's the famous get the F out of the way lane.  Right.  The famous get the F out of the way.  Now, if I'm going 100 in the left lane, but someone behind me is right on my bumper, obviously he's going to go faster than me. 
[01:02:30]  Right.  I will move over and I will bow to you.  You don't say.  And I will give you the road.  You don't say, hey, I'm doing 100, screw you.  Yeah.  No, you get out of the way because he wants to do 110.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  That's why, because people are doing 55, 60 in the left lane.  They look in the mirror and they go, well, I'm doing 60.  No, you know what?  Get out of the way.  Get out of the way.  The guy behind you wants to go 70.  Exactly.  Nothing wrong with that.  He can handle it.  Oh, God, that's annoying.  I got road rage just sitting here now.  Got to play this song, man.  What do we got? 
[01:03:00]  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  That's the band Marvelous 3 and Freak of the Week.  Sophie and Anthony clashing there as well.  I fought the law.  And, oh, man.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  There's this rule around here.  We got to get our commercials in before 7.  Mm-hmm.  It's only two and a half minutes.  Stay there.  Two and a half minutes.  We'll close the show.  Got lots to tell you guys.  Mm-hmm.  A lot of stuff added to the websites.  We'll explain that.  We got Tara in the studio. 
[01:03:30]  All right.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  And it's Tara wrapping up the festivities today.  We've got a few minutes left here.  But, yeah.  Good show.  Had a lot of fun.  Anthony posted a great animated feature, man.  Yes.  The little Barbie animation on the website.  That's going around.  If you haven't seen it yet, it's Ken doing a nasty with Barbie.  It's pretty funny.  Looks like Charles Manson.  Yeah.  It really does.  Yeah.  They dressed him up to look like a kook. 
[01:04:00]  But that's on the semi-live studio cam.  Yes.  If you go to the Opie and Anthony section of the WNAW website.  I got an F.  Like, you know, I have a jeer within a cheer.  And cheers and jeers in TV Guide Opie.  Yeah.  I have an F.  You within an F.  Okay.  Abby from New York says, F the people who are in an elevator.  See you walking in the elevator, but don't hold the door.  Who do they think they are anyway?  Wow.  I have a counter F.  You, Abby.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  I got to disagree with her as well.  F the people that walk up to the door and expect you to open it up for them. 
[01:04:30]  Mm-hmm.  I was standing in there waiting.  And you know how long it takes the elevator door to close?  Sometimes you're sitting there hitting the closed door, closed door, closed door, closed door.  Closed door.  Here comes someone.  Yeah.  And then right when it's ready to close, somebody comes in, sticks their arm in.  Now they walk in.  Now you're waiting.  Closed door again.  Mm-hmm.  You know something, Abby?  I'm waiting for the door to close.  So you just wait for the next elevator like I waited for mine.  You know what we do?  We're in the elevator and someone's coming.  Yeah.  We make it look like we're making an effort to reopen the door. 
[01:05:00]  So we just start pushing.  Yeah.  We're not pushing any buttons.  We're pushing the wall.  Like, oh, look, look.  I'm trying to help you out.  Look.  Oh, it closed.  I'm sorry.  And you put the sorry face on as the door says, like, oh, sorry.  Sorry.  I'm trying.  Oh, look at the door.  I jump by.  Ha, ha.  You know?  I'm serious.  All right.  Well, Tara, are you happy with the new pictures we took of you?  Incredibly.  Man.  There's like maybe two bad ones, but that was like mid, like pushing my hair back or something.  The rest, Anthony did an excellent job.  Oh, thank you.  It wasn't Anthony. 
[01:05:30]  It was the camera.  It was the camera.  I used the good camera this time.  Yeah, the pictures, the second batch of pictures we took the last two hours.  Awesome.  Make the first pictures look ridiculous.  Disgusting.  Yeah, definitely.  I think my favorites, the one where you're in the Joe Boxers.  Yeah.  Those are good.  Okay.  That are cut way up.  Those are nice.  And, of course, the lovely couch pictures.  Oh, my God.  Those are great.  Oh, my God.  Absolutely great.  Check it out.  Well, Anthony didn't put them up yet, but sometime this weekend you'll be able to check  those out.  They'll replace the old pictures of Tara. 
[01:06:00]  And now I feel confident to be challenged.  I have complete confidence now.  And, guys, if you have any doubt after you see the new batch of pictures that Tara's not  the hottest girl to ever pose naked on the Opie and Anthony show, you're whacked.  I would agree with that.  And anybody who feels they could challenge Tara, please let us know.  I'm hoping a new challenger comes forth this coming week.  Great.  Are you trying to get rid of me?  No, but it's just fun.  It's fun for us.  Who are you kidding, man?  Yeah, for you.  You just see me biting my nails on the way to work. 
[01:06:30]  No, let me tell you.  With these new pictures, it's going to be very difficult for a challenger to come in  here and take your position.  But, ladies, if you think you got what it takes, please contact the Opie and Anthony  show.  Hopefully, we'll have someone come in here next week.  We'll get those pictures up this weekend.  All right.  You want to end with Bit of the Week?  Bit of the Week was, what, Yoshi?  Definitely Yoshi.  Chinese New Year.  The Year of the Hare, or Rabbit.  Yes.  And they didn't have any fireworks this year.  Giuliani put the kibosh on that again. 
[01:07:00]  Well.  They had those lame-o fake fireworks.  Like, they have these air tubes that shoot confetti and powder out that look like smoke.  Ooh.  It's like, why bother?  Wow.  Why bother?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because they used to just throw the mats and mats of firecrackers in the sidewalk.  And the dragons going through and there's fire.  Oh, it's great.  Mm-hmm.  But now it kind of sucks.  All right.  So, we got a hold of Yoshi.  Mm-hmm.  To talk about the Chinese New Year.  Yes, I know Yoshi's a Japanese name, but our Yoshi is Chinese. 
[01:07:30]  Sorry.  More PC.  Oh, you should see the letters we get on that as well.  Do you know Yoshi is a Japanese name?  Why do you have him working at a Chinese restaurant?  That's racist.  Well, first of all, Yoshi's not real.  Second of all, look at first of all, jackass.  My God.  And why can't a Chinese guy be named Yoshi?  Why not?  Yeah.  Why not?  Why not?  I don't know. 
[01:08:00]  Obviously, it's very dishonorable.  Whatever.  You are named Yoshi.  And quickly, it looks like most people are bummed about the trade now that it's been a day or so.  A lot of people are really bummed that Wells is leaving.  At first, people were really excited, but now they're sitting there going, wait a minute.  You know what?  This kind of stinks.  Did you hear Corky Steinbrenner talking about how he personally spoke with David Wells?  Yeah.  And he was a little choked up.  He got all choked up.  David, can I see you in my office? 
[01:08:30]  David, I just got to tell you, you are the second best pitcher in baseball.  That's a bummer.  And I'm the richest guy in baseball.  Put two and two together, David.  But then, in the same breath, he turns around and talks to Roger Clemens.  Yeah, he's on the phone with Roger Clemens.  I got you.  I got you.  I got you.  I got you.  You're the best pitcher in baseball. 
[01:09:00]  Roger the Rock and Clemens are the best pitcher in baseball.  And to have a man like you on Brian TV.  Yoshi!  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  All right.  So, getting back to Yoshi.  I don't want to leave, but.  Yeah.  It always stinks when we leave on Friday, because then we're not here until Monday, but.  Oh, well.  All right.  Let's do Yoshi. 
[01:09:30]  Yoshi.  Talking about the Chinese New Year.  Yes.  We got him on the phone.  He was a little drunk.  He was very drunk.  We got him on the phone. </pre>
