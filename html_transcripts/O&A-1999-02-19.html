<pre> I saw that.  And then the flight attendant after the wet t-shirt contest decided to do a strip tease  for all the girls.  And he's like a 30 year old guy or whatever he was.  What a mess.  An absolute mess.  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be running into a little bit of turbulence so you're going  to see some bouncing cans now.  What's up gentlemen?  Hey, what are you doing man?  I was the one who called and hung up your phone trying to take that but now I'm back.  Yeah, that was great.  Did you happen to notice that all through that show last night they kept announcing for the  news checking in on you?  Check it out.  Check it out.  At 10 o'clock you were through the wet t-shirt contest and I think you could come on to like 
[00:30]
 a quarter to 11.  I know.  Well that's what they do.  The big tease.  They make it sound like oh my God, look how horrible this is but they use it because they  know everyone wants to see it.  Did you hear that lady complaining?  Yeah.  I can't play camp after a long lady this time.  Well, you know, I hate to say it but she definitely has a good point I guess.  I would love to sit here and go, that's great but this egg.  If I was in like the back row of the plane I'd be pretty damn paranoid.  Hold the phone. 
[01:00]
 Look at it this way.  There are planes where it's business as usual, everything's boring, you're sitting there  that go down.  This plane made it, didn't it?  Everyone had a grand old time.  So who cares?  I don't think it makes any difference.  There's a party bus in the sky.  That's all you need.  I don't know.  Did you notice last night during the TV show the guy with the crushed hand, the one guy  talking about timing, it's crucial to get the hand back to the hospital.  Here's the guy picking up and he's like walking straight up.  I saw that. 
[01:30]
 He was taking his time.  Yeah, time is of the essence to get it back and reattach the hand.  Meanwhile the ambulance guy, he's got it in his hand and he's this little saunter down  the street, not even rushing, holding it by like two fingers and the guts are like falling  out of his hand.  I think it's hard to run when you're nauseous because...  That freaked me out.  There was a lot of great TV on last night.  There sure was.  One of which I must say wasn't really the Stephen King movie, the third part.  Well, Lisa from...  Right now I'm in Edison. 
[02:00]
 Lisa writes, I want to send a big F you to Stephen King for the worst ending to a three-part  movie ever.  I watched the damn movie for two nights and then I was very disappointed last night.  First of all, I hate what they're doing with two and three-part movies.  All right, Sunday we watch part one.  Monday we watch part two.  And then what happens?  Part three.  Thursday.  You kind of lose interest by then, you know?  That sucks, first off.  Well, what was the problem with part three?  Well, the whole thing with the first two parts of this movie is this demon guy or whatever 
[02:30]
 the hell he is comes to this small island town and he starts making people kill themselves  and doing evil stuff.  And he goes, what?  Just give me what I want and I'll go away.  So the whole two parts you're like, what does this guy want?  It's got to be something pretty wild.  What does he want?  Right.  What does he want?  Now I'm hooked.  The last half hour of the third part, he finally decides to tell everybody what he wants.  He wants a kid to teach his ways to carry on in his little thing, whatever he does,  which wasn't explained. 
[03:00]
 And then they give him a kid and he goes away.  And that was it?  Yeah.  Get out of here.  The whole thing is based on him.  Give me what I want and I'll go away.  Well, it ends.  They gave what he wanted and he went away.  And that was it.  Stephen.  Ridiculous.  Stephen, write some good stuff.  What are you doing?  I wrote this one expressly for telling them.  This is one of my most scariest moving camera. 
[03:30]
 He's frightening.  All right.  Listen, we've got black crow's tickets to give away and we'd like to give them to our  faithful listeners, you know, because there's a lot of concert pigs out there that just  listen to any W today to win the tickets.  We want to try to take care of the people that have been with us for a while now.  So we're going to ask them, uh, opiate Anthony trivia once again today for the black crow's  tickets.  All right.  Then we know that you listen to the show and we're taking care of you like you take care  of us.  All right.  That works. 
[04:00]
 Um, want to do the Oprah Winfrey question?  Hmm.  Hmm.  The Oprah Winfrey question.  I'm just trying to think what the hell is the Oprah Winfrey question?  Remember we were talking about how Jerry Springer is kicking her ass in the ratings.  Yes.  Happened again this week, by the way.  Okay.  So what's the, what was the question?  What should Oprah show on her show?  Right.  To get ratings.  What should she expose?  That's it.  And you got to use the exact term we used. 
[04:30]
 Okay.  All right.  The rock of New York, one of the seven W any W black crows kicking my heart around all  weekend long.  You've got chances to win tickets to see the black crows.  And right now we're giving away a pair.  What's the opiate Anthony trivia question again, Anthony?  You might remember we discussed Oprah Winfrey getting all pissed at Jerry Springer saying  that if the sleaze isn't cleared from the airwaves, she's quitting television.  And Opie made a suggestion. 
[05:00]
 Well, cause she's ticked off because she's just getting her ass kicked.  Yeah.  Her ratings are getting beaten by Jerry Springer.  Yeah.  So Opie had a suggestion, Oprah, that maybe if she exposes something, her ratings will  go up.  Mm hmm.  And we want the proper terminology.  Yes.  Yes.  I any W.  Yeah.  Let's check in.  I have to.  Uh, yeah.  Go ahead.  All right.  Cool.  I want to send out after you to, uh, George Steinbruner.  Well, a lot of people are, yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Go ahead. 
[05:30]
 Go ahead.  Put me on the trade of the heart and the soul of the IPC.  You're on.  The greedy guy.  You're on the air, dude.  Live.  I am?  Yeah.  Oh, nice.  All right.  I have to send out.  I have to listen to you because you should trade yourself.  All right.  Can't say, George.  I hate those digital phones.  They want an answer.  Hi, any W.  Who's this?  They want an answer.  My name is Joanne.  Hi, Joanne.  We got you live in the air.  What is the answer to the Opium Anthony trivia question?  The balloon knot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oprah should go on TV and show the world her balloon knot and she would get better ratings. 
[06:00]
 That's right.  That's correct.  I would tune in to see that.  Ugh.  Where are you calling from?  Um, Newark right now.  All right.  Hold on the line.  You got black crow's tiggers.  Oh my God.  You're kidding me.  Yes, you are.  You're pulling my leg.  No, no.  No, you are.  You're joking me around.  No, no, no.  I sent you that call yesterday.  Did you get it?  Oh yeah.  We got your call.  No, did you like that one?  Oh, I loved it.  My God.  It was great.  Really?  No swear? 
[06:30]
 Yeah, I got it.  All right.  That's new.  No, you got the black crow's tiggers.  No, I didn't.  Oh my God.  You did.  You want me to just go on to the next caller?  No, please don't.  All right.  Then you hold the line.  Okay.  What station wants to see your balloon knot?  I'll see you.  Yeah.  Hey, hey.  Line two.  Where's your balloon knot station?  Just hate when stations go, what's your fiber, right?  I'll stash it.  Like they're not going to say, like they're going to say another station after you gave  them a prize.  All right.  Chris from Comac, Long Island's home to the Comac Motor Inn writes, F you to George Steinbrenner 
[07:00]
 and his baby face, a hole in the GM for trading away the only real and down earth player in  David Wells.  I'm bummed.  You know, now that I've had a day to think about it.  Yeah, I'd rather see David Wells pitch.  I know Roger Clemens is a great pitcher and you have to make the trade, but I'm just sick  of us, us meaning New York trading away the hard, hard-to-get, hard-to-get, hard-to-get  players.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed. 
[07:30]
 I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed. 
[08:00]
 I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  I'm bummed.  They're going to win.  They're going to win every game this year.  Of course they are.  But you don't need a rocket.  Mad Dog, I didn't think you were coming in today.  I didn't think I'd come in today.  Say hello to you, Roy.  So you think it's a terrible trade?  I think it's a terrible trade for baseball.  Terrible.  You know, you're on hour, I believe, thirty discussing the trade.  Hour thirty discussing the trade is a horrible trade, a terrible trade for baseball.  I think there ought to be a celery case.  And that's going to be a terrible trade.  We've thirty discussing the trade.  I'm thirty discussing the trade.  Yeah.  It's a horrible trade, terrible trade for baseball. 
[08:30]
 All right.  I think there ought to be a celery cap in baseball.  A what?  A celery cap.  Celery cap!  Oh, salary cap.  That's what I said!  Celery cap.  Celery cap.  Can't you hear me?  All right.  I said a celery cap!  All right, we're going to be back after this, this Toyota commercial.  You like Toyota, don't you?  I like Toyotas.  Turn them on.  And now he's waiting for him to have over with him. 
[09:00]
 Greg from Staten Island writes, through the fax line, 212-957-WNEW, please send an FU  to my jackass boss for thinking me and my fellow coworkers are alcoholics for going  out last night, getting drunk and coming in 15 minutes late today.  He would drink too if he had to work for him.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, Eve 6 and Leech.  Sophie and Anthony on FU Friday.  Whoa, sorry about that.  That just ended.  I guess it goes into the next song on the CD, huh?  Yeah. 
[09:30]
 Sorry about that.  Ralph the Tourist in the studio.  Ralph.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  We love Ralph.  He's our pal.  Show sounded great, by the way.  Thank you very much.  I love the noon hour.  I'm enjoying it.  I get a little help, though.  What do you mean?  From other people.  Everybody calls up with their requests and stuff.  Yeah, well.  When you put it all together, it sounds great.  Thank you.  I was digging the toadies the other day.  Fair.  I know.  We might.  What is that?  Isn't there a law about a lot of the fact stuff like that?  Oh, I know.  Whew, that's nasty.  You should see the stuff our listeners fax us. 
[10:00]
 We can't discuss all of it, unfortunately.  Okay, well, let's not then.  Some guy just sent me a website where it's a whole website dedicated to people getting  off with vacuum cleaners.  That's dangerous.  Somebody lost the destruction.  Yeah, but they got pictures of guys, girls, couples, you name it, you know, getting off  with vacuum cleaners.  You just got to make sure you don't use a flow bee.  You ever see the flow bee, the haircut thing that attaches to the vacuum?  Make sure you remove the flow bee before you use it. 
[10:30]
 I was trying to trim.  So, Ralph's in the studio.  He says goodbye every night before he goes home.  And he said that he's going to be returning some sheets.  He said he bought, I bought sheets on the street.  And you're going to return them?  Wait, wait.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  You bought them on the street?  Yeah.  And you're going to return them?  He was very official looking.  He had the badge and like this whole...  What badge?  Well, whatever.  He bought the badge from the guy two little booths down.  All right, so what's the deal?  You went, you were on the way to train and you saw a guy selling sheets and he needed 
[11:00]
 a sheet.  He's right outside of Penn.  Right outside Penn.  But he's there every day.  All right.  He's there every day.  Now, what's the problem with the sheets?  Are they used?  What's the deal?  They don't go.  They don't go?  What do you mean?  Quote unquote.  They don't go.  Oh, wait a minute.  They don't go.  You were trying to do something nice.  They don't go.  And buy some sheets.  You saw the sheets and go, you know, we need sheets.  So being a guy, you have no sense of what goes and what doesn't go.  Number one.  Number two, I also don't know that there is, there is sheet... 
[11:30]
 Whatever.  What's the word I'm looking for?  Sizes?  No.  Queen size?  K size?  Quality.  Quality.  The hierarchy?  The quality.  As far as how...  The basic quality.  All right.  There's a thread count.  Thread count, yeah.  Thread count.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thread count.  So these are really...  They're $2.20.  They're real cheap.  No.  $2.20.  I've heard of...  Geez.  There's sheets in the hundreds, actually.  Oh, is there? 
[12:00]
 That are super cheap.  Now, how much did you pay for these sheets?  Is that important?  Kind of.  I want to see how much you got ripped off.  No, it wasn't.  $20 a set.  All right.  And each set has a flat sheet, fitted sheet, and two pillowcases.  And tell them the thread count was too low.  Yeah, that's what I'm going to tell them.  You're going to try to get your money back.  They don't go.  Do you got a tape recorder or are you going to tape this one?  No, I don't have my little Michael Cassetti recorder with me.  They're not going to take it back?  They don't go.  He said he'd exchange them.  Exchange them for the same sheets.  No, no, for different sheets.  Really?  I got them committed to exchange, at least.  Ralph, are you going to play some three-card Monti on your way down to the Penn Station?  Come on.  Oh, you're making me sound like a sucker now.  Come on.  I'm going to go to the Penn Station.  I'm going to go to the Penn Station.  I got them committed to exchange, at least.  Ralph, are you going to play some three-card Monti on your way down to the Penn Station? 
[12:30]
 Come on.  Oh, you're making me sound like a sucker now.  Come on.  Well, 20 bucks for a set of sheets is a good deal.  They don't go.  I got a great New York story, man.  Who knew?  Me and, I was playing with a rock guy, old band.  We'd come driving in, had a guy drive us into the city to do a gig, and he's waiting out  in the car, and we come back out after the show, and he goes, guys, check it out, got 
[13:00]
 a VCR.  We're like, oh, VCR, huh?  He said, 100 bucks, he says.  This is back when VCRs are going for 300, 400 bucks.  Yeah.  And we look at the box, it's this shrink wrap that's really thick, very hard to open, and  there's just pictures cut out of a circular from the Wiz or something with VCRs on them.  And he's over a black box, and he's just psyched. 
[13:30]
 So we feel real bad.  We got to tell him now.  He just, no, it's not going to be...  Dude, there's nothing in there.  No, I'm feeling it.  All right.  So he opens it up, and it's really a bitch to open.  They make it that way, so you can't just do it on the spot.  And there was bricks.  A couple of bricks and some newspapers rolled up inside.  He was so bummed, man.  Where's the guy? 
[14:00]
 Where is he?  I don't know, I gave him the money, and he went off into a corner somewhere.  He was gone.  I got to tell you, I did have a fear that I was going to take these sheets home, but  I'm going to be holding them.  Yeah, well, that could happen, too.  I was nervous about the game.  All right.  He seems like a nice guy.  I'll let you know how it goes.  Yeah, let him go Monday if he takes back your sheets.  I think he will.  Preused, maybe.  I have a lot of faith in people, so I think he will.  You're a hell of a trusting guy.  You're crazy in the city to have that much trust, man.  I don't think so.  I wouldn't even have bothered taking them back. 
[14:30]
 They're drop cloths now, you know?  Yeah.  That's it.  Yeah, use them next time you have your pain or something.  Rags.  They may end up that way, but...  Yeah, well, maybe.  I'm going to give it a shot anyway.  All right.  Well, good luck to you.  Let us know what happens.  I'll give you a call on the train.  Yeah.  Yeah, do, actually.  1027WNEW, the Rock of New York.  Tom Petty.  Don't do me like that on FU Friday.  You're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  We have a guy in the line that is going to jail in two weeks, 
[15:00]
 so he needs to win the Black Crow's tickets  so he can see one more show before he goes into the joint.  Jail?  Jail.  What do you got, man?  Hello?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, who's this?  Opie and Anthony, we got you live.  Hey, I need some Black Crow's tickets.  Why?  Because I'm going to jail like a week after that concert.  Why are you going to jail?  Basically because my lying ex-girlfriend is hanging with my friends  or my ex-friends, and so I guess my ex-girlfriend and my ex-friends, 
[15:30]
 and basically they set me up to save themselves.  Uh-uh, sounds like a drug thing.  No.  No?  No, it was like a violence thing.  All right, who did you beat up?  Nobody, but they're saying I did, you know what I mean?  Who are they saying you beat up?  A car and some, you know, some threats, and they were in fear and this and that,  but really I didn't do anything.  It was just a setup so they could have me removed by the police  so they could do their own thing or whatever without getting caught. 
[16:00]
 Now how long are you going to wait for?  Up to two years.  Ooh, Wade, you beat up some stuff pretty seriously if you get in two years.  I didn't beat anybody up, I really didn't, you know,  but what happened was they slapped me with a restraining order,  and that means I can't see my kids.  Yeah, so, you know, it was like a month before Christmas,  so I went over there in a rage, screaming like, you know,  what a bitch, because now I can't see my kids for the holidays,  and that was a violation of a restraining order, 
[16:30]
 and that's basically what I'm looking at.  Ouch, oof.  That's basically my charge is, you know,  contempt of court and violation of the judge's orders and the whole bit.  Well, it's, I don't know, we might have to let the listeners decide  if we should give you the tickets or not, man.  That's fine.  If you go either way.  So when are you going?  Probably like a week after that concert.  Like March, early March?  Yeah.  And for how long?  Up to two years.  Up to two years. 
[17:00]
 All right, hold on a sec.  Thank you, bro.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Hello.  Hey.  How's it going?  No, we got you on the line with somebody else.  Where's the other person?  I don't know.  No, it's not working.  That stupid phone.  I don't know, though, because if this guy,  it's violence against your girl?  Well, that's what they said, yeah.  I don't know, unless we get the other side of the story. 
[17:30]
 Too many stories, you crazy bastards.  All of a sudden you get the restraining order.  You go over and figure,  you won't love me no one.  No one.  Hey, hold on right there.  Let me tell you something.  I don't want her back.  Who would want more of that?  You know what I mean?  You just want your kids.  Well, sure.  It's not fair to me or them.  All right, hold on.  I'm going to see what the listeners think.  All right.  We like to do this stuff with our listeners.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey, N.E.W.  You think this guy deserves the black crow's tiggas?  He deserves them as much as I do. 
[18:00]
 So you want him instead of him.  Why, you going to the joint?  No, I'm not going to the joint.  But listen, you know, he's going to the joint,  so he deserves the contract more than me.  Well, he's not going to think about it.  Yeah, think about it.  He's going to be like, you know, doing stuff that...  He sounds like a tough guy, but I don't know what he looks like.  Let me ask you a question, guys.  He might end up after the black crow's being queen of the weight room prom.  I don't know.  That's what I mean.  We're trying to hook him up one last time before, you know...  Well, let me ask you a question.  Yeah?  Is it my fault that he's going to the joint? 
[18:30]
 No.  No?  I don't know.  I don't know if I would lose a chance of getting a ticket.  All right, so you vote for no.  No.  Okay, thanks.  He votes for no.  Hi, N.E.W.  N.E.W.  Hey.  Oh, my God.  You can't use those words.  He said, F, no.  Dude, it's not looking good.  One more try.  Hold on.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hello?  Yeah, what do you think?  Does this guy deserve tickets before he goes into the joint for two years? 
[19:00]
 You know, I think he does.  But I tell you what, he has to promise not to kick anyone's ass.  What, in the joint?  Yeah.  He might be getting his ass kicked.  No, not in the joint.  Not in the joint.  The concert.  Oh, yeah, really?  That's true, too.  You can't go kicking anyone's ass in the concert.  All right, man, thanks.  So there's two no, one yes.  All right.  First one to three.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, yeah.  Why don't you tell him, why don't you give him those tickets?  Oh, you want to give it to him? 
[19:30]
 Why do you want to give them to him?  Because that bitch keeps his kids away from him.  That's not cool.  Well, all right, there's a yes vote.  Hey, this lady thinks you should get the tickets, bro.  Bro.  Ah.  Just tell him that.  All right, we will, thanks.  Okay.  We used to be able to conference callers, but no more, I guess.  And now I just hung up on the convict.  All right, we'll try to take care of him.  We'll call back.  All right. 
[20:00]
 What a clusterf that was, man.  Damn.  We used to be able to conference callers, but for some reason we can't.  I don't know if he should be rewarded, I hope he.  No.  Without any proof of, you know, we don't know what her side is.  We should get the lady on the phone as well.  Yeah, I'd hate to give a wife abuser.  Right.  Any tickets.  Not saying that he is, but I don't know that he isn't.  1027 W.N.E.W., the Rock of New York, FU Friday with Opie and Anthony.  Thanks for checking us out for the ride home. 
[20:30]
 There's a guy, I think this is the one right here, hopefully.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, yeah, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Nothing, I want to give a big fat FU to some chick I don't even know her name,  because listen to this, I was on a business trip about a month ago.  I went to a bar, right, I'm just an average looking guy, met some girl,  I thought, wow, this is great, look at my luck, right, went back to her hotel room,  everything went well, ended up hooking up with this girl.  Now I've got General Warke.  No.  Right, I knew it was too good to be true, because how often do you really go out 
[21:00]
 and get laid, you know, it always happens to the other guy,  and when it finally happens to me, you know.  Well, all right, first of all, where were you?  General Warke.  Do I have to say?  No, but are you married or have a girlfriend back home?  No, that's a good point, I just got my girlfriend recently,  so I'm like, I'm on the prowl, and you know when you're out looking for it,  I get it, since the one night I was out looking for it, I actually got it.  With growing toads, you get General Warke, pal.  Was she really hot and stuff? 
[21:30]
 That's just it, she was hot, you know, and I was like, oh.  Why didn't you wrap it?  It broke.  Oh, come on.  Yeah.  Don't BS us, pal.  Why didn't you wrap it?  I didn't feel like it.  I didn't bring any with me, because I really never thought, you know,  I didn't think I was going out and getting laid, you know.  What do you do with General Warke?  I don't know, but oh, God, I went to my doctor,  and he told me what I had, and I was like, oh, shh.  How embarrassed were you when the doctor said you have General Warke? 
[22:00]
 Luckily I got tested for other crap too, and everything came up all right,  but I had to laugh, you know, oh my God.  There's a lot of people laughing at you right now, trust me.  General Warke, yeah, big F-U.  I had a big F-U, you know.  Next time wrap it, man, what are you, crazy?  I know.  You can say that, but it's not always...  Exactly, you can say that, but you know,  I mean if you didn't have one with you, you'd be doing the same thing I did.  No way.  No, I'm saying it's not out of the realm of possibility that if you're out 
[22:30]
 and you don't have one with you and the opportunity is there with a hot girl,  you're just going to go, you know something, ee, let me just spin the wheel.  No way.  I would have to, no, just do some other stuff, man.  I'm too paranoid for that.  I'd be freaked out.  Well, now I am too, you know.  Yeah, exactly.  You're lucky you got off with General Warke.  I know, I know.  Could have been a lot worse.  Yep, keep up the good work, guys.  You're making me laugh at least.  No, you just made everyone else laugh. 
[23:00]
 All right, man.  Later.  Have a good weekend.  Keep that thing tucked away.  Oh, without a doubt.  All right, we got the Barbie thing up on the website?  Yeah.  Yeah, I had to do some flielin' and dealin', but it's up there.  All right, yeah, somebody, what, emailed you the Barbie and Ken...  Yeah, Barbie and Ken doing it video.  It's pretty funny.  Somebody did a little animation, used Barbie and Ken Dollin, did one frame at a time and  animated them actually doing it.  And if you want to check that video out, we have it up on the website. 
[23:30]
 Yeah, it's on the Semi-Live Studio Cam section of The Open Anthony, part of the W&W website.  We're going to have to change the name of that link.  The Semi-Live Studio Cam, because it's not, it's more than that now.  It's turning into more than that.  Yeah, it's just our part of the W&W website.  Stuff that anytime you don't want associated with their little website.  Honestly, I'd be surprised if this Barbie and Ken thing stays up through the weekend.  So you might want to check it out right away.  Yeah, it's pretty funny.  Right away.  Just click on our pictures through the W&W website and go to the Semi-Live Studio Cam. 
[24:00]
 You'll find it from there, okay?  Right.  And speaking of the Internet, where's Tara?  Tara's visiting us today.  Tara, hottest girl to ever pose naked on The Open Anthony show.  And we promised that we'd take some brand new pictures of her.  Better pictures, yeah.  I don't know who's going to take these pictures.  Do we have a better camera?  She was in the bathroom.  She was in the bathroom?  Wow, Tara, look at you looking cute today. 
[24:30]
 Hey Tara, what's up?  Hey guys.  Yeah, you weren't crunching in that bathroom, were you?  No, thank you.  Do you like that nasty facts in front of you?  Ew.  Isn't that gross?  Does that look like Mindy?  Well, did you have fun Friday, first of all?  Yeah, I had a great time.  Yeah.  I had a really good time.  Did you take a breeze through that magazine, that Big Butt Mindy who was at?  Yeah.  Oh boy.  Pretty sick.  We've been hanging with Mindy for a while.  She's been sending her Big Butt magazines for a while.  Yeah.  You know, there are guys that get really turned on by that stuff. 
[25:00]
 Really?  By the Big Butts and stuff.  Like the big marshmallow butt.  I just look at it as like a freak of nature.  I'm not sexually turned on by that, you know?  At one point she went to sit on my leg when I was sitting on the stool.  It felt like a bunch of pizza dough in my lap.  I swear to God.  Because I've never been a chub chaser so I've never had the pleasure of grabbing onto the huge ass. 
[25:30]
 But when she sat on my leg it was like this squishy big fat ass.  You can't get into that.  Well the email went nuts.  There's a bunch of guys that want her home number and stuff.  They're really into Mindy and her big ass.  Chubby chasers.  We got pictures on her website of her as well.  And if you find the hidden link you'll get to see Mindy getting spanked.  What happened to the rest of them?  The rest of the pictures?  Yeah, like the...  Oh yeah, yeah.  Well there's some that were too blurry and other ones... 
[26:00]
 We're still uploading some stuff.  We might end up putting some maybe eyes on there.  Yeah, believe me, we're getting ahold of the video.  I want to put some video up and take some snappies off of the video itself.  That's unlimited photographs.  So I think we'll be adding pictures for the next, I don't know, year.  Year, yeah.  From our party last Friday.  Until the next party.  We have that much stuff.  But Tara came in because we want to take some more pictures of you because she was just not happy with the pictures we took in the studio.  No.  And if she's going to be hottest girl ever to pose naked on the Open Anthony show she wants to be represented better. 
[26:30]
 Right.  So she's going to give another shot today.  That's legit.  So what do you got for us today?  All sorts of nice stuff.  I brought a lot, actually yeah, about like three or, I don't know, like five or six outfits.  Really?  Yeah.  Alright.  Yeah.  Bravo.  It'll be cool.  And honestly we don't have your next challenger yet.  No one has come forth.  I know, what is that man?  I think the girls are a little scared, you know?  Chickening out.  We're still waiting for another lady to step forward to, you know, to take pictures of you.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, I was surprised with the vote.  She beat Spike.  It was like 5,500 to 3,800 around there. 
[27:00]
 Yeah.  Tara won over Spike, so.  She's cool.  And we'll get another challenger eventually.  Yeah.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York Sugar Ray, every morning.  Those guys playing Roseland tonight.

[32:00]
 She took one look at him and ran away.  She just ran off.  Poor Chang couldn't even marry.  He's arranged a wedding.  They took his second face off and he looked just as stupid.  At least he had an excuse the first time.  I could pressure you and read a hickey on your thigh at the same time.  Eat the raw main and egg roll at the same time. 
[32:30]
 Hi, NAW.  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  I saw that video with the guy with the intestine yesterday.  I almost lost my dinner.  I'm telling you, seeing him push that stuff down, just now when you were describing it,  I was gagging.  That's pretty bad.  Now, was that the sickest video you saw last night on that show?  I called my wife and I told her, don't put it on the television.  She was upstairs.  So what did she do?  She put the television on and she started screaming at me because I told her to put 
[33:00]
 it on.  It was sick.  It was great.  It was great TV last night.  I was saying, why don't they just run the small intestine on the inside?  Why do they have to put it on top of the guy's rib cage in between his ribs and his skin?  They said because he had infections in the past.  They had tried other things.  His body rejected it.  They figured they would just run it on the outside in case there was a problem.  I don't know what the deal was.  That was amazing.  The box has reached new lows, guys. 
[33:30]
 Of course.  I'll watch every single show.  Exactly.  Every single show.  Yeah.  The Guinness Book of World Records is going to have a guy live trying to set the record  being on fire for the longest time next week.  Pretty soon, Frazier and Niles will be doing operations on themselves to get the ratings  back.  Sitcom.  Did you see what Regis was doing this morning?  No.  Regis was mud wrestling with a chick.  Swear to God.  I was watching and going, is this Regis or Jerry? 
[34:00]
 Like the old Richard Bay show.  Yeah.  That was a good show.  Regis was beating the crap out of this girl.  Really, he was putting her in a headlock and flipping her over on the ground.  He was roughhousing her.  I think he was liking it.  She was in a bikini.  All right, man.  Well, thank you.  You're doing a great job.  Hey, thank you.  All right, so long.  Everyone knows what it takes to get some ratings on TV.  You've got to be sensational.  You've got to have the shock value.  It's got to be simple.  People are tuning in to these shows in record numbers, so keep them coming. 
[34:30]
 You know what happens?  You don't have to sit there at the beginning and wait for commercials to go to the kitchen  and get something and pay attention.  Two hours and three, six-hour mini-series.  These are shows you could pop on around the channel and go,  Oh, I'm stopping right here.  Halfway through.  It doesn't matter.  Well, you see that on TV.  Where are you going?  Nowhere.  You're flipping through that?  You see Two-Headed Chang.  What are you going to do?  You're staying to see more.  Go to Friends?  Right.  No. 
[35:00]
 No, you want to see more of Two-Headed Chang.  Two-Headed Chang.  That was poor.  You should see a two-butted wang.  He ripped next door.  All right.  Well, Tara's getting ready.  We're going to take some more photos of her and put it on our website,  hopefully by the end of the day.  Yeah.  I think we've got to do these rather quickly.  Yeah.  Scott Colombo's got to pop them on the computer.  All right.  We'll do it while the commercials are playing.  All right.  All right.  So Tara's stripping as we speak.  What does she have on?  Whoa, what is that?  Wow. 
[35:30]
 Oh, my goodness.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  I'm not going into a commercial.  That's very nice.  Take your headphones off.  Okay.  Those are better than the underwears you were wearing that day.  Wow.  See, she came prepared for the photoshoot today.  Yeah, definitely.  Wow.  Wow.  Let's just do one like that on the chair.  Hold on.  I've got to learn how to drive this camera.  Okay.  That is an amazing shot right there.  My camera, but wow.  Let me...  I guarantee that shot will be better than anyone you did last time, Anthony.  That's a good one.  Yeah. 
[36:00]
 The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW.  We usually play that on Tuesday nights for the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  That's our pal Red Peters.  And below me is Ophie and Anthony and Tara Hattie.  Below me is Ophie and Anthony and Tara hanging in the studio putting on another outfit for  us.  We're taking another set of photographs for her because we promised that we would do that  because she didn't like the first batch we took.  Better camera.  She's got little outfits she brought in.  She's prepared.  I've been snapping away like crazy.  Yeah, she's prepared this time.  Oh my God, she's changing totally.  Whoa, hello.  Whoa, whoa, whoa. 
[36:30]
 You just distracted us, man.  What's up with that?  How's it going?  Damn.  Wow, look at that.  That's a beautiful baby.  Very nice.  Very nice.  Let me get that.  Hold on.  Anthony's distracted.  He's been taking pictures for the last 40 minutes.  Okay.  Come on.  There it is.  Perfect.  We've got to make sure the shot is right.  That's fine.  What do you got, man?  Yo, man, check this out.  How did you guys play Blow Me during Lent on a Friday when a girl can't eat meat?  Come on.  Take after you to Lent on a Friday. 
[37:00]
 Come on.  All right, you make a good point.  Oh, man.  Come on.  We're going to Lent on a Friday.  That's pretty funny.  You guys rock, man.  Have a great weekend.  You too, man.  All right.  Hi, N.A.W.  This is Two-Face Chang.  Two-Face Chang checking in from last night's shocking medical video show from Fox.  I make a lot of money at Two-Face Chang.  I work at a Chinese and Japanese steakhouse.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I flip many burgers and many set-one chopped chicken and lots of pork. 
[37:30]
 Everyone thinks they're pork.  Two-Face Chang eats pork and chicken at the same time.  Amazing.  I talk to people one side, flip chicken to other side of the table.  My other mouth, my teeth look like a bunch of wontons.  I had stuffing mouth.  Oh, we have wonton soup, a fresh salad.  See him?  Yeah.  It wasn't even really a mouth.  I don't know what that was.  Well, he had 12 teeth in the side of his face. 
[38:00]
 It was a vagina.  It was like a beak.  Oh, look.  I'm going to go ahead and put that on the camera.  Later.  Later.  I think I just had to get out of control.  Everyone's trying to do the Yoshi voice.  I like that.  Mark from Jersey, he's got an F-U.  I want to send a big F-U to Sue, a girl from work that I dated years ago.  She dumped me and made it crystal clear that I should get out of her life.  She then proceeds to follow me to the gym, to concerts, and other places.  She sleeps with my friends and then spies on me.  She's now doing this psycho stalker thing with hang up phone calls and bogus beeper messages. 
[38:30]
 Stay out of my F in life, you lunatic.  Thank you guys.  Keep on rocking.  Tara's really hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.  All right.  There you go.  Two-faced Chang can give a hummer and say, I rub you at the same time.  Yeah, there's a couple.  I don't think I can find there's some feedback.  The black's very nice.  Yeah.  But what is that, purple?  Let me see.  Where's your black?  That is black. 
[39:00]
 Oh, that is very nice.  I think this amazing girl is going to love that one.  That's a good one.  I like when I go like, get up there.  Oh, yeah, you get up there.  Sure.  You can get up there.  Yeah, you get up there.  Yes, you get up there.  Let's move all this stuff.  Oh, she just spilled the water all over her lingerie.  Did she?  That's okay.  That's strategic.  Hey, before you leave, can you take, you know, you've got to be completely naked and sit on every chair in the studio.  Trust me, it'll drive someone nuts around here.  I'm serious.  I can't say now. 
[39:30]
 We're not allowed to talk, we're not allowed to mention that person's name anymore.  That's all right.  We need a few paper towelettes.  I spilled water.  All right, here comes Kevin, our intern.  Before it goes into, yeah, wipe off the works.  Is that what he is?  He's an intern?  Is that why he's running around like a lunatic?  Well, yeah, but he wants to get in radio.  He does a great job for us.  Yeah.  And look, look at the perks.  Look at this little ditty he gets to sit through.  Look at the perks he gets. 
[40:00]
 Anyway, while they clean up the table, there's a couple, they were so bummed they missed  our talk on the Shockey Medical videos.  They were looking forward to us talking about it all day and we did it earlier and they're bummed.  Sorry.  We want to know what you guys thought of Two-Headed Chang.  We've been talking about Two-Headed Chang though the whole show.  Yeah.  All right, Terry, get up on that table.  All right, let's see.  Let's see what this is.  All right, everyone else out of the picture.  Yeah, the pictures aren't the same when you have a bunch of dorky guys in the background 
[40:30]
 with you.  It's like you've got Hot Tara in the picture and Ben the Fag is in the background.  Well, sitting like that's a good start.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, yeah, with the leg hanging over.  Wow.  Wow, that's great.  That's pretty good.  I feel like Rick.  She's prepared today.  Yeah, totally.  I think the guys and girls are going to love these pictures even more than the first batch.  I'm going to have to do it that way.  Yeah, let me move this.  Hold on.  Be patient.  I've got to get the right shot.  Wow. 
[41:00]
 That's a great shot.  That's an unbelievable shot.  Hit it.  Oh, yeah.  Hold on.  Please hold.  There it is.  All right.  We're going to try to get these pictures up before 7AM.  Yeah, I've got to get this camera into...  Yeah, is that velvet by the way?  Velvet bra and panties?  Very nice.  All right.  You should do one of those good... what do they call those?  Very artsy shots, maybe on the couch.  Like a... what's it called?  No, we're like... first of all, ace the bra and the bottom thing, but you have your leg 
[41:30]
 kind of curled up and you're kind of...  I know you're going to do it.  Yeah, yeah.  But we're going to do it out there on the couch.  Yeah, but out there.  Now that's rock and roll, kitties.  The Rock and Roll, kitties.  The Rock of New York, 1027W, N.E.W., Soundgarden, Rusty Cage from Bad Motor Finger.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Chris Cornell, one of the best singers out there, I think, in my opinion.  Without a doubt.  Well, Anthony, our spies here at N.E.W. did well for us once again.  What do we have? 
[42:00]
 What do we have?  I got in my hand, or I should say I have in my hand, a FCC complaint letter going to  the FCC.  How'd you get that?  With lawyers and everything involved.  Come on.  That's serious.  Let me see.  Totally serious.  Look, there's the lawyer's name at the top.  Don't want to give them any air time.  But what is a lawyer complaining?  I believe so.  Or this lady went through a lawyer.  Why would you go to a lawyer to voice your complaint?  February 19, 1999, this is going to the FCC, Federal Communications Commission, Complaints 
[42:30]
 Department, referring N.E.W.'s Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  I knew it was just a matter of time before we start getting in trouble again.  What does this busybody have a problem with?  Well, I guess this lady talked to our boss.  And that's where the letter starts off.  As per the telephone conversation I had with your organization, I have attached pictures  from the N.E.W. website.  Oh, no, this is after she talked to the FCC.  It's even worse. 
[43:00]
 As per the telephone conversation I had with your organization, I have attached pictures  from the N.E.W. website.  These pictures are from the live broadcast and illustrate the content and context of  the Opie and Anthony show on Friday, February 12, 1999.  You will note that in one of these pictures, Mendy sits on and straddles Twinkies while  wearing thong underwear.  Is this serious?  I swear to God this is serious.  This lady FCC'd everybody, including the mayor.  Wait, mayor who? 
[43:30]
 The mayor.  Giuliani?  Yes.  Get out of here.  Freaking CC the mayor, all our advertisers.  She included the photos from our website.  Oh, brother.  Which, by the way, has nothing to do with the N.E.W. website.  Of course.  All right.  You will note that in one of these pictures, Mendy sits on and straddles Twinkies while  wearing thong underwear.  This was described in detail by Opie and Anthony on the air immediately after which they asked  the audience if anyone wanted a lick.  Did we do that? 
[44:00]
 I am offended.  This was also the context and content of Opie and Anthony's conversation when they started  talking about playing with the ladies, wah wah, a few minutes later.  I don't think we talked about that.  They did an impression of Popeye's voice saying how he loved to play with olive oil's  Pusky all night long.  What's the offense given about a Pusky?  By anyone's standards, I believe that this would be considered indecent. 
[44:30]
 Anyone's.  No, yours, you bitch.  Especially as it was being broadcast at approximately 4.30 in the afternoon.  At that hour, the major listening audience of a rock station would be children and teenagers  as most adults, including the parents of these children, are still at work.  If by some chance this isn't indecent and inappropriate enough for children and teenagers  to be listening to, there is much more.  For example, on Wednesday, February 10, 1999.  Great long-time listener here. 
[45:00]
 This lady has heard every single show since we started.  Opie and Anthony had a woman named Spike at the studio.  They asked her to strip for them in the studio and to pose in various pornographic poses  completely naked while they took pictures of her that they posted on the internet.  They described what she was taking off, her body parts in detail, her poses,  and what parts they were photographing at the moment.  We got to hear all of their lewd reactions, jeers, and comments as this was going on.  Oh my God! 
[45:30]
 What's the problem here?  She also cc'd the NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA 
[46:00]
 United  for the listeners to look at and vote on who had the best body.  At this time they also began mocking a man in the studio who they said locked himself  in another room because he didn't want to be part of this scene and didn't want to be 
[46:30]
 photographed with Spike.  Spike had chains and whips and they claimed the man who they described as black didn't  want to come out because he was afraid of whips and chains because his ancestors were  slaves and he had watched roots.  This is the writing of a mad woman.  Now Earl's in the studio.  What's your name?  What's your name?  Mary Ann.  Mary Ann.  I won't give the last name because then she'll sue me.  Mary Ann.  Mary Ann.  Mary Ann.  Get a grip Mary Ann. 
[47:00]
 Number one.  Number two.  Kind of like it.  It's cool.  I might become a client.  Black girl by the way.  And you were the one who said the roots comment.  I made the roots comment.  The black guy said the roots comment.  Alright anyway.  Well settle down Mary Ann.  Alright let's move on with the letter here.  I'm afraid of whips and chains because his ancestors were slaves and he had watched roots.  They dragged him out, handcuffed him, took pictures of him being whipped by Spike and  dedicated the next song Black Dog to him.  Boy she was paying attention. 
[47:30]
 Well we did.  Okay that's all true.  It just so happened the next song was Black Dog.  What can I tell you?  I'm the king of sags.  What can I say?  Finally on many occasions including Tuesday February 16th 1999.  Uh oh Tuesday.  What could this kind of be?  At approximately 4.30pm they gave out the address of pornographic and nude websites over the  air and encouraged listeners to check them out.  No that was.  What?  The top listing for Flash Mountain.  Yeah yeah. 
[48:00]
 Oh yeah we'll give out that website again.  It's hysterical.  It's FlashMountain.com.  FlashMountain.com.  W-W-W.  Bunch of girls that flash at Disney when they're going down the flume ride.  That was the day I won.  Yeah that's very funny.  FlashMountain.com.  FlashMountain.com.  FlashMountain.com.  Marion.  On February 16th 1999 specifically they gave out the address and then logged onto the site  themselves and described over the air what they were seeing.  Oh my god.  I have made several attempts to contact the station manager Mr. W-W-W at WNEW but he is 
[48:30]
 never available and does not return my phone calls.  Join the club.  As far as I'm concerned I am trying to raise my children with a basic respect for others  including all races and sexes.  Here it is the raising of the children portion.  I certainly do not want them impressed with this image of sex, this treatment of women  and such disrespect for other races.  I wasn't offended.  By any standards these broadcasts are indecent and inappropriate and if you have any other  questions please give me a call. 
[49:00]
 Sincerely, Marion.  By any standards.  By your standards that you are now trying to push on everybody else, Marion.  What credentials does Marion have that she can judge for everybody else what they should  listen to?  Marion knows what makes a good parent.  Marion knows what people should listen to.  So let's put Marion in charge of everything.  We'll run Barney 24 hours a day and the world will be a marvelous place with no crime or 
[49:30]
 hatred or anything because Barney will be running 24 hours a day.  And simple as this, Marion, if people aren't being entertained by the Open Anthony show  there is something called ratings.  We don't get ratings, we are gone, we are out of here.  But if the people are enjoying the show then so be it.  Let them enjoy this.  And there is a knob on the radio too.  Right.  You can turn it on, you can turn it off.  She has all the pictures from the website.  She's got spikes spanking the guy from our party. 
[50:00]
 Like the knobs on our website.  Look at the picture of this.  There are knobs on the radio.  You can turn it.  Oh wow.  She's got the Twinkie picture.  Yes, she's got the pictures of Mendy sitting on the Twinkies.  This all went to the FCC.  You know what?  I don't think the FCC has anything to do with regulating the Internet right now.  That might change.  And these pictures aren't on the WNEW website because the school pigeon that works here  at NEW told us on that one.  Isn't there a restriction area for kids if she doesn't want her kids to see that? 
[50:30]
 Then she should do her parenting and not let her kids go on the computer.  Hi, NEW.  I've been waiting to talk to these guys.  We're live on the air.  What do you got?  Marianne is out of her mind.  Does she know how to make Roswell happy?  Probably not.  I would say in my opinion from reading this letter, probably not.  Probably not a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  No, definitely not.  You guys have an educational program here.  We're just trying to have fun, make people laugh after a long, hard day of work. 
[51:00]
 Simple as that.  It annoys me when people try to put their morality on everyone else because they're  offended by something or something might even excite them and titillate them and that upsets  them.  So they want it wiped out and taken off instead of like we were saying, radio is something  you can turn off.  You know?  True.  So turn it off, Marianne.  Don't put your little ideas on everybody else.  Maybe people enjoy hearing about a fat girl's butt sitting on a Twinkie and a guy licking 
[51:30]
 it off.  That's pretty entertaining.  I tell you the truth.  If I wasn't doing it on the air here, if we weren't presenting it, I'd be listening to  it on the drive home.  So Marianne.  You know, crazy people are trying to take away our constitutional rights in a world  where we desperately need them.  Exactly.  I would strongly suggest that anyone that does like the Opie and Anthony show, there's  a feedback section on the WWW website.  Please go there and tell them what you like about the show. 
[52:00]
 Because now we're going to have to get all our material together for the FCC.  We've been through this millions of times in the past.  It's pain in the ass.  Maybe Marianne was a little, she got a little titillated with those pictures.  I'm saying perhaps this could happen.  Is this possible, Opie?  Not very possible.  If she was looking at Mendy sitting on the Twinkie, maybe Marianne was thinking, oh,  I would like to taste that Twinkie.  I'd like a little taste.  I'd like to lick the cream, lick the cream out of that cellulite crater. 
[52:30]
 She'd drop her moomo once in a while and sit on a package of hosties, she might be a lot  happier.  That's right.  She doesn't like this bit either, so I want to play it on the air.  Oh, man.  Screw her.  Marianne's thinking, I want to be a Twinkie.  I want Mendy to sit on me.  And to our spies at N.E.W., thank you very much for getting this letter.  The Rock of New York, 1027WNW, that's Holes, Celebrity Skin, Holes Play with Marilyn Manson, 
[53:00]
 April 6th, Continental Arena.  And on the 7th of April at Nassau Coliseum, tickets go on sale tomorrow morning at 10am.  Hey, O&A, I want to send a big F you to Marianne or whoever wrote that letter to you.  And also, I love your show from Ian X in Staten Island.  Another email from Tom in Huntington points out an interesting thing.  As per the claimer, tell Marianne she's not supposed to be distributing those pictures.  Reproduction or distribution, as per our disclaimer.  See, line three of the disclaimer. 
[53:30]
 All right, we've got to give away some Black Crow's tickets.  We like to give the tickets to our faithful listeners, not the fringe listeners.  I mean, you know, hopefully you fringe listeners will start becoming full-time listeners eventually.  But we do want to take care of the people that have been with us for a while.  Yes.  So we do open Anthony trivia.  Tell you the truth, this one, this question I got only goes back about a month.  Yeah.  So you got a pretty good shot at it.  Give us a call right now.  212-757-1027.  The question is, what did Anthony do in high school to make some extra money? 
[54:00]
 Yes.  To make some extra money, Anthony did something in high school.  It was a little bizarre, I guess you would say.  A little, I was being creative.  Definitely not the obvious.  Don't say, you know, was he selling drugs?  You know, that's the obvious.  No, this is kind of twisted.  It was a service, I will say that.  And you admitted to this when Lewis Black was on the show with us, I believe. 
[54:30]
 I think so.  Just to give people a little help there.  All right.  All right.  Really fast.  I got to send this F you out from Sandy.  Hey, guys, I want to send a big F you out to all the lazy ass people who still have  their Christmas decorations up and a real big F you to the idiot morons house I pass  by every day who has the nerve to still light up their tree and decorations.  It's absurd already.  Keep up the great work, you guys.  I've seen that.  Christmas decorations down.  That's Sandy in Jersey. 
[55:00]
 They had a story on the news about a pitfall that attacked some people and stuff and they  shot it with a tranquilizer and the dog died and stuff.  So they went to the dog's owner's house and she was talking through the crack in the doorway.  She had her big huge Christmas wreaths still up on the door.  Really?  I mean, what is it?  It's February 19th.  Quickly another F you, big F you to those a-holes in Midtown who have those large golf umbrellas.  I saw this yesterday.  Yeah. 
[55:30]
 When it rains and they refuse to move out of the way while they're walking super slow,  God, I hate those jerks.  Well, thanks, guys, for letting me vent and thanks for keeping me smiling while I slave  away here at work.  You guys are doing a great job.  Well, that's the famous, you know, I'm the most important person in the world.  Yeah, we've noticed, I'm sure all you have too, that most of the people on this planet  think they are the most important person on the face of the earth.  They are the only person and should not be inconvenienced for anybody.  You'll notice you'll be driving behind them. 
[56:00]
 Left lane and they are doing 40 miles an hour and they have open highway ahead of them,  open highway in front of them and they won't look in the mirror.  You know something, if I'm in the left lane and I see no one in front of me, I automatically  look behind me to see if somebody maybe wants to go faster than I am.  Yeah.  But these people are the most important people on the face of the earth, so they don't look.  the supermarket that put the shopping cart in the middle of the aisle and then stand  next to it as they're looking for their groceries. 
[56:30]
 And I'm standing there with the cart and I'm looking going, well, don't you know other  people are shopping?  No.  Other people want to get their cart through?  No.  Most important person on the face of the earth.  They don't care.  No.  The person that has to pick all their numbers at the counter, their lottery tickets?  Yeah.  I mean, not just one or two, let's say 200 numbers and you're sitting behind them and  you just want to buy one lousy paper.  Give me the 235 box, give me the 789, give me the 48 with the six box that, reverse 369, 
[57:00]
 4, I want a pack of gum, you bastard.  A pack of gum.  Yeah, look behind you, man.  I got a daily news and two quarters of my hand.  Yeah.  Just say, oh, here, you want to go ahead of me real fast?  No.  Of course not.  All right, let's get the answer for the black-crow's tickets.  All right, so the question again, what did Anthony do to make some extra money when he  was in high school?  In high school.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hi, clone for the black-crow's tickets?  Yeah, you're live on the radio, so turn down your radio because we're on delay.  No problem. 
[57:30]
 All right, what's the answer to the question?  Take a lucky guess, man.  I don't know, you got guys' dates?  No.  No.  I figured I'd be wrong.  Oh, you thought he was a pimp?  I don't know.  You never know, man.  Yeah, you never know listening to this show, but no.  Can I get tickets anyway?  Unfortunately not this time, man.  Sorry.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Hi, N.E.W.  Hey.  Hi, you got an answer to the question?  Yes, he used to do pregnancy tests in his closet.  Yes!  Wow! 
[58:00]
 Bravo!  What's your name?  My name is Holly.  Hi, Holly, where are you?  At the Garden State Parkway at 101B.  How's the traffic tonight?  Sucks.  I know.  Well, that's why we don't do any traffic on the show because it sucks every night.  Yeah, especially Friday.  You know, the radio stations that do traffic, it's just a waste of time.  People know when it sucks or when it's good.  Exactly.  You know?  Wow.  She actually got it.  Very, very good.  You guys are great.  I have to say, can I do an F you out to Mary Ann, tell her to get off her cross because somebody  else needs the wood. 
[58:30]
 Yes, she's just...  Thank you.  I like that one.  Yeah, thank you.  She's going to wreck it for everyone.  It always happens, Todd, but we'll see what happens.  But Holly, thanks.  You got the black crow's tickets.  Beautiful.  And Anthony, I have to explain this again really fast here.  All right.  Cool.  Back in the hallowed halls of John H. Glenn in Elwood where I was attending high school  part-time.  Can we all?  Yeah.  Sometimes the girls would get in a little nervous.  They'd get a little nervous if they missed their period. 
[59:00]
 And back, this was, God, late 70s, early 80s.  So...  You're 80 yourself, guys.  Yeah, well, we're young, trust me, compared to what they had back.  Yeah, and the girls would get a little nervous that they were pregnant.  And the EPT pregnancy test used to be a bitch.  It wasn't just, you know, whiz on a stick and wait for a plus or minus.  This was like, you know, I'm like Simon Barr Sinister.  I wear my test tubes. 
[59:30]
 Bring me the urine.  So you'd have to set these things up for three hours in a very still place.  Like you couldn't move it and it had to be kept in dark, cool area.  And most of the girls couldn't just, you know, risk their mom walking in on them  while they're doing this test.  So I would do the test.  They would come over to your pad.  They would have to buy the test and pay me 20 bucks and hand over the little vial of urine.  And I would do the test for them in my closet and come back with the results. 
[60:00]
 Dr. Anthony.  I also did pap smears.  Yeah, weekend kind of colleges.  Yes, I was aspiring gyno.  How many girls came to you?  I think in my career, I've got to be over 10.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  They weren't screwing in my high school.  It worked good.  In your career.  I must say the way I thought of the idea was I was the first to use it.  It was like, oh, damn.  Then I thought, wow, what a pain in the ass. 
[60:30]
 What if somebody can't do this at their house?  Where would you put it?  You know, out in the woods.  Now how did you advertise?  A word of mouth.  A word of mouth got around school?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  One side, you know, because you had to tell everyone, yeah, how to do the test.  And it came up negative, thank God.  Then someone would come to me and go, what test was that, man?  My girls kind of, you know.  I was like, yeah.  And then the girls would come to me and then I would do the test.  Do you get any dates out of this?  No, no.  See, and my dean in John Glenn, Pete Polina, said I wasn't amounting to anything in that  school.  Yes, I was, Pete.  You're making some very scared people real happy. 
[61:00]
 All right, Holly.  What did you guys do?  I was in the middle of the night.  I was in the middle of the night.  I was in the middle of the night.  I was in the middle of the night.  I was in the middle of the night.  I was in the middle of the night.  All right, Holly.  Bless you guys.  All right, hold on the line.  We're going to get info from you for the Black Crow's tickets.  Congratulations and thanks for listening.  Have a great weekend.  You too.  All right.  There's someone that pays attention.  That's good.  Very good.  All right.  Robin Sayasid writes, he's got a good one, F18 wheelers on the LIE that think no one  wants to cross the center lane from the left lane to get off. 
[61:30]
 The trucks line up like four in a row and form a wall.  F'ing blows.  God, that is so true.  Wait, wait, wait.  I got a problem with that guy.  That is true, though.  You're in the left lane.  Yeah.  You want to cross over to the right lane?  Yeah.  Why are there trucks next to you?  You should be way past them.  I swear to God.  No, because I hate the people in the left lane that are doing the same speed as the  truck.  As the truck.  Now I'm trapped.  Or the people that ... I love the people that are afraid of the rigs.  So they stay right at the rear quarter of the truck in the left lane the whole time  because they don't want to pass it. 
[62:00]
 Meanwhile, that's probably the most dangerous place to be.  Past the damn thing.  Basically, if you're in the furthest left lane, you should be going 200 miles an hour.  It should be that if you're in the left lane and anyone's behind you, get out of the way.  Anyone.  So the lane should be reserved for people doing 150.  That's the famous get the F out of the way lane.  The famous get the F out of the way.  Now if I'm going 100 in the left lane but someone behind me is right on my bumper, obviously  he's going to go faster than me, I will move over and I will bow to you. 
[62:30]
 And I will give you the road.  Hey, I'm doing 100, screw you.  No, you get out of the way because he wants to do 110.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  That's why because people are doing 55, 60 in the left lane and they look in the mirror  and they go, well, I'm doing 60.  No, you know what?  Get out of the way.  Get out of the way.  The guy behind you wants to go 70.  Exactly.  He can handle it.  Oh, God, that's annoying.  I have road rage just sitting here now.  Got to play this song, man.  What do we got?  The Rock of New York, 1027WNEW, that's the band Marvelous 3 and Freak of the Week. 
[63:00]
 Sophie and Anthony, clashing there as well.  I fought the law.  And oh, man.  All right, we got to take a quick break.  Does this rule around here?  We got to get our commercials in before 7.  It's only two and a half minutes.  Stay there.  Two and a half minutes.  We'll close the show.  Got lots to tell you guys.  A lot of stuff added to the websites.  We'll explain that.  We got Tare in the studio. 
[63:30]
 All right, it's Sophie.  It's Anthony and it's Tare wrapping up the festivities today.  We've got a few minutes left here, but yeah.  Good show.  Had a lot of fun.  Anthony posted a great animated feature, man.  Yes, the little Barbie animation on the website.  That's going around.  If you haven't seen it yet, it's Ken doing a nasty with Barbie.  It's pretty funny.  Looks like Charles Manson.  It really does.  They dressed him up to look like a kook, but that's on the semi-live studio cam. 
[64:00]
 If you go to the Opie and Anthony section of the WNAW website.  I got an F. I have a jeer within a cheer.  Cheers and jeers in TV Guide, Opie.  I have an F-U within an F-U.  Abby from New York says, F the people who are in an elevator.  See you walk into the elevator, but don't hold the door.  Who do they think they are anyway?  I have a counter F-U, Abby.  I have to disagree with her as well.  F the people that walk up to the door and expect you to open it up for them. 
[64:30]
 I was standing there waiting.  You know how long it takes the elevator door to close?  Sometimes you're sitting there hitting the closed door.  Close door, close door, close door.  Here comes someone.  And then right when it's ready to close, somebody comes in, sticks their arm in.  Now they walk in.  Now you're waiting.  Close door again.  You know something, Abby?  I'm waiting for the door to close.  So you just wait for the next elevator.  Like I waited for mine.  Know what we do?  We're in the elevator and someone's coming.  We make it look like we're making an effort to reopen the door. 
[65:00]
 So we just start pushing.  We're not pushing any buttons.  We're pushing the wall.  Like, oh look, look, I'm trying to help you out.  Oh, it closed.  I'm sorry.  And you put the sorry face on as the door says, oh sorry.  I'm trying to open the door.  I tell my...  Ha ha.  You know?  That's very tough.  All right.  Well, Tara, are you happy with the new pictures we took of you?  Incredibly.  Man.  Maybe two bad ones, but that was like mid-like pushing my hair back or something.  The rest, Anthony did an excellent job.  Thank you.  It wasn't Anthony, it was the camera. 
[65:30]
 It was the camera.  I used the good camera this time.  Yeah, the pictures, the second batch of pictures we took the last two hours.  Awesome.  Make the first pictures look ridiculous.  Disgusting.  Yeah, definitely.  I think my favorite's the one where you're in the Joe Boxers.  Yeah.  Those are good.  The, that are cut way up.  Those are nice.  And of course, the lovely couch pictures.  Oh my God.  Absolutely great.  Check it out.  Well, Anthony didn't put them up yet, but sometime this weekend you'll be able to check  those out.  They'll replace the old pictures of Tara. 
[66:00]
 And now I feel confident to be challenged.  I have complete confidence now.  And guys, if you have any doubt after you see the new batch of pictures that Tara's  not the hottest girl to ever pose naked on the Open Anthony show, you're whacked.  I would agree with that.  And anybody who feels they could challenge Tara, please let us know.  I'm hoping a new challenger comes forth this coming week.  Great.  You want to get rid of me?  No, but it's just fun.  It's fun for us.  Who you kidding, man?  Yeah, for you.  You just see me bite my nails on the way to work. 
[66:30]
 Now let me tell you, with these new pictures, it's going to be very difficult for a challenger  to come in here and take your position.  But ladies, if you think you got what it takes, please contact the Open Anthony show.  Hopefully we'll have someone come in here next week.  We'll get those pictures up this weekend.  All right.  Do you want to end with Bit of the Week?  Bit of the Week.  What's that?  Yoshi?  Definitely Yoshi.  Chinese New Year?  The Year of the Hare?  Or Rabbit?  Yes.  And they didn't have any fireworks this year.  Giuliani put the kibosh on that again. 
[67:00]
 They had those lame-o fake fireworks.  Like they have these air tubes that shoot confetti and powder out that look like smoke.  It's like, why bother?  Why bother?  Yeah, because they used to just throw the mats and mats of firecrackers in the sidewalk  and the dragons going through and there's fire.  Oh, it's great.  But now it kind of sucks.  All right, so we got to hold to Yoshi to talk about the Chinese New Year.  Yes, I know Yoshi is a Japanese name, but our Yoshi is Chinese. 
[67:30]
 Sorry.  More PC.  Oh, you should see the letters we get on that as well.  Do you know Yoshi is a Japanese name?  Why are you working at a Chinese restaurant?  That's racist.  First of all, Yoshi is not real.  Second of all, look at first of all, jackass.  My God.  Why can't a Chinese guy be named Yoshi?  Why not?  Why not?  Why not? 
[68:00]
 I don't know.  Obviously it's very dishonorable.  You're named Yoshi.  And quickly, it looks like most people are bummed about the trade now that it's been  a day or so.  A lot of people are really bummed that Wells is leaving.  First people were really excited, but now they're sitting there going, wait a minute.  You know what?  It kind of stinks.  Did you hear Corky Steinbrenner talking about how he personally spoke with David Wells?  Yeah.  And he was a little choked up.  He got all choked up.  David, can I see you at my office?  David, I just got to tell you, you are the second best pitcher in baseball.  That's a bummer. 
[68:30]
 And I'm the richest guy in baseball.  But then in the same breath, he turns around and talks to Roger Clements.  Yeah, he's on the phone with Roger Clements.  I got you.  I got you.  Roger Clements, I got you. 
[69:00]
 You're the best pitcher in baseball.  Roger the Rocket Clements, I'm the best pitcher in baseball.  And to have a man like you on my TV.  Oh boy.  So getting back to Yoshi.  I don't want to leave, but it always stinks when we leave on Friday because then we're  not here until Monday.  But oh well.  It's a good thing, because it's like the best thing about baseball, is that you can  make a huge difference.  You can't do all the work you need to do.  You just have to go to the ball.  You have to go to the ball.  You have to go to the ball.  And that's the best thing about baseball.  I would've thought that was something like a four-leaf clover.  It's like a four-leaf clover.  It's a good thing.  Oh boy.  Alright, so getting back to Yoshi.  I don't want to leave but...  Yeah.  It always stinks when we leave on Friday because then we're not here until Monday but oh well.  Alright, let's do Yoshi. 
[69:30]
 Yoshi.  Talked about the Chinese New Year.  Yes.  We got him on the phone.  He was a little drunk.  He was very drunk. </pre>
