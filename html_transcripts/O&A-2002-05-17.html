<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heavy promotion of their upcoming celebrity softball game, urging women to attend in bikinis as cheerleaders.  The hosts then vehemently defended themselves against a Boston Herald article by Dean Johnson questioning the veracity of a previous segment featuring a caller who claimed to have committed double murder. They dismissed Johnson's reporting and boasted about their show's success.  Following this, they controversially premiered several unreleased tracks from Eminem's upcoming album, *The Eminem Show*,  explicitly stating their intention to antagonize competing radio stations.  A listener called in expressing surprise and admiration for their actions, followed by an angry call from a competing station's program director.

Andrew Gore, a collector of medical oddities, was a guest throughout much of the show.  He showcased items from his collection, including a two-headed kitten (Johnny and Joey), a double-bodied pit bull (Cujo), a Richard Ramirez sleigh set with handcrafted dolls, a hand tracing from Richard Ramirez with satanic markings, Odorous's (from the band Guar) toenail, and a preserved deformed fetus-like specimen. Gore repeatedly promoted his Satan Sideshow booth at the Roseland Ballroom tattoo convention.

Dr. Dot, a masseuse, also appeared multiple times throughout the broadcast.  She described her career, detailing massages given to numerous rock stars (including Def Leppard, Eminem, and Kiss), and her unique "bite method" massage technique.  The conversation with Dr. Dot became increasingly sexually suggestive, featuring discussions of erotic massages and the hosts' reactions to her strong massage techniques; she even gave impromptu massages to some in the studio.  Dr. Dot also promoted her services and upcoming book.  Another guest, Marion, participated in a bizarre interaction with Dr. Dot involving a discussion of physical appearances and a brief shoulder massage, alongside crude commentary about hairstyles and body types.

A phone caller, "Frenchy," launched into a highly offensive and vulgar homophobic and misogynistic tirade directed at Marion.  After this call, the show featured a "movie game" with Marion and another guest, Lady Di, acting out scenes from films like *American Psycho*, *Animal House*, and *Full Metal Jacket*, with callers guessing the movies.  The performances and guesses generated further crude humor and banter.

The show concluded with a caller, John from Philly, correctly identifying a scene from *Rambo: First Blood*.  The hosts thanked Lady Di and Marion, praising Lady Di's Sylvester Stallone impression. Andrew Gore again promoted his tattoo show appearance and website, satansideshow.com, offering t-shirts.  The hosts mentioned the "audio holocaust" listeners endured to win free tickets to an event and celebrated their strong ratings in New York, boasting about beating K-Rock.  The broadcast ended with playful banter, including a Hitler reference and a confession about a furtive glance.  The show also received a cease and desist letter from Interscope Records regarding the Eminem tracks, to which the hosts reacted humorously.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Yeah, it's Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, how are you guys doing?  Great job.  I can't believe he's coming up for the softball game, I'm so excited.  He said throw out the first pitch, and then, how much you want to bet, he does something  during the course of the game that is just completely annoying and he won't stop.  Like, I picture him running out and tackling someone on their way home, like, and getting 
[00:00:30]  very, like, well, I just figured I'd try and help the team out.  He's going to work the whole stadium, I guarantee it.  Yeah, because we refuse to let him play.  No, he's not playing.  He's the official drunk of the Opie and Anthony Celebrity softball game.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  I know you don't like Tom, Jimmy.  Wow, Jim, relax.  Not many picks available for the Celebrity softball game.  Standing room only is left. 
[00:01:00]  I think you could get him through Ticketmaster.  Sponsored by Coors Light.  Yes.  So much going on during that softball game.  We'll get into it.  Hopefully some ladies will stop by to become bikini babes.  Oh, we should bring that up quickly right away, though, so we have the whole show for this.  If you're a girl and you want to be right there on the field in front of the dugouts during  this softball game we're having on June 1st, come down to the studio with your bikini,  because here's the deal. 
[00:01:30]  We need bikini girls.  They're going to be, like, cheerleaders.  They're going to help out with giveaways and just kind of, you know, excite the crowd  during the game.  So, girls, if you feel you're up for it, you don't have to do anything with money here  or any objects.  You just got to come down to your bikini, give us a quick little show, and odds on, if you're  anything halfway decent that we think the crowd's going to enjoy, you're in.  There you have it.  Just come down.  We better have one show up today.  Please.  How sad.  Busy show today, by the way.  Oh, my goodness gracious. 
[00:02:00]  We got Andrew Gore stopping by with more disgusting things.  What else do we have?  Oh, my God, the retarded Laverne Shirley coming back to try that gangster game again.  Oh, wait, hear the collective, oh, from our listeners.  But today, it's pretty much guy movies.  Yeah, guy movies.  Guy movies.  They're going to be acting out some of the famous scenes from these guy movies in their  inimitable fashion.  That's right.  Yeah.  A little private message to Dean Johnson, trying to get a lot of things out of the way immediately. 
[00:02:30]  Dean Johnson from the Boston Herald, give it up.  Give it up.  Just up with that guy.  Give it up and realize that we are so much smarter than you and all the other journalists  out there.  Give it up, my friend.  Give it up.  There's no story.  Stop writing about the Eddie the murderer thing.  I guess he doesn't find this program riveting.  It kills you to know that we are smarter than you.  Smarter than you. 
[00:03:00]  How many times do you have to tell somebody something?  And he still continues to write, thinking, you know, oh, you'll be that hoax that they're  pulling.  It's like, we're telling you.  We told you, Dean.  Told you a hundred times.  There's no story here, Dean.  You'll never have us figured out, Dean.  Most people will never have us figured out.  There you go.  But the Boston Herald is writing another story about Eddie the murderer, Anthony. 
[00:03:30]  He will not drop this thing.  You want to read that real fast?  Yeah, we'll give it a quick read.  All right.  This was in the Boston Herald today.  Dean Johns.  You expect riveting programming on Opie and Anthony's syndicated radio show about as often  as...  I forgot to read the headline.  What?  Oh, possible hoax on Opie and Anthony demonstrates power of medium.  And then he goes on, you expect riveting programming on Opie and Anthony's syndicated radio show 
[00:04:00]  about as often as an in-praise-of-Bill-Clinton program on Rush Limbaugh.  Oof.  Whacky horn.  Yeah.  That might have been like a relevant analogy back in 92, 94.  Dean, really on the cutting edge there.  Oh.  But Tuesday's notorious O&A show featured Eddie, the caller who confessed to a 1977 double murder, 
[00:04:30]  was terrific radio, he says.  Oh.  Thank you, Dean.  Thank you, Dean.  Thank you.  We finally made it, Opie.  Dean says it was good.  Finally, Dean thinks we do some terrific radio one time to time.  Thank you, Dean.  Thank you.  Thank you.  New York police have since labeled Eddie a hoax.  And Opie and Anthony's involvement in the scam is up in the air?  No, it isn't, Dean.  It's up in the air in your stupid head.  In your head, in your column.  But no one has approached us from any federal agencies, local law enforcement agencies, our 
[00:05:00]  own company that suggests that anyone is looking into the fact that we were in on any scam.  Dean, no one's even looking into it to see if they should be looking into something.  Exactly.  Because people that know and listen and have half a brain in their head, Dean, know that  this was Eddie who called up and was a kook and said he killed two people.  And that's the way it went down. 
[00:05:30]  There was no conspiracy on Opie and Anthony's part.  I love pulling out these journalists because they do this all the time.  They try to create stories.  Yeah.  That are just not there.  This is not there.  You're up there.  Why don't you just write about how we're slathering and destroying Rock Hole?  That's a fun story.  Eddie, we still don't know who he really is.  No, we told you who he is.  Every newspaper down here that wrote the story, Channel 9 News that broadcast the story, had 
[00:06:00]  his name, address, his last name, quoted his mom.  Everyone knows who Eddie is.  Dean, Friday morning quarterback, was reporting that when the detectives went and talked to  Eddie, he was wearing a Giants jersey and nothing else.  Right.  That's the guy who Eddie is.  Proving that the guy was what he was, a kook.  Says, Eddie, we still don't know who he really is, was good. 
[00:06:30]  Neither too smooth nor too crude.  He laid out a Soprano-style tale with matter-of-fact vivid and unflinching detail.  All right.  Oh, and he played it beautifully.  Played it beautifully.  Because we're good actors, Anthony.  Sounding at times ecstatic at their good fortune.  And now he gets the quote wrong.  We thanked the radio gods, Anthony said Wednesday.  Eh.  I said that.  Right. 
[00:07:00]  Not Anthony.  The one person he tries to quote, he gets wrong.  He's always getting quotes wrong, by the way.  And we did thank the radio gods, because this one fell right on our laps.  Of course.  That's what made it so great for us.  We didn't have to plan something so elaborate for our show.  There were big chunks of dead air right where you'd expect them.  Yet the show was so messy in places, it was difficult to believe it had been planned.  See?  That's the show.  It is messy. 
[00:07:30]  In places.  The place?  Between three and seven.  That's right.  Are Opie and Anthony in trouble?  Maybe.  No!  We're not in trouble, Dean!  Dean, maybe means there is a possibility that we would be in trouble.  Dean, there is no possibility of ONA being in trouble here.  None.  If I may use the A in the third person.  None.  None.  Maybe.  But, and then he starts making up things.  But if the FCC decides to do any spanking, the station would get the first slap. 
[00:08:00]  The FCC prohibits the broadcast of false information.  If a licensee knows about information is false, you could get in trouble.  That's pretty much what he says.  Public harm includes causing diversion of law enforcement or other public health and safety authorities from their duties, according to FCC guidelines.  The NYPD checked out Eddie and ONA and listened to the tape of the show.  So, the public harm clause could apply if it's decided ONA were in on the prank. 
[00:08:30]  Now, doesn't something being decided sound like something is now like being mulled over so a decision can be made?  If it's decided we were in on a prank?  There's no decision that's going to be made, Dean, because nothing is being looked into.  Ass!  Then they talk about all the licensees and all the stations that air our program, including WBCN up there, could be fine for the broadcast. 
[00:09:00]  Though it isn't likely.  It isn't likely?  No.  It isn't.  It just isn't.  It's not going to happen.  More likely, any W, the duo's home station, would take the first hit.  As for Opie and Anthony, the home station could take action against them.  But that's not likely either, as long as they keep playing what?  Keep playing what?  Yeah.  It's like cut off.  Ah.  Keep playing, I think, uh, innocent or something? 
[00:09:30]  Oh, right.  Keep playing innocent.  Like, we don't fess up to it.  Like, we're playing innocent.  Right, right, right.  None of that changed the fact that Tuesday Show was great radio, even if it was not honest radio.  It was as honest as it comes, you ass.  And then he talks about the ton of publicity we got.  You know why it's as honest as it comes?  Because from, uh, the, the first minute of that phone call, we said the guy is either  telling the truth, believes he's telling the truth, or completely delusional.  Yeah.  You can't get any more honest than that. 
[00:10:00]  We laid it all out.  We laid out all the options for you, Dean.  We planned it out so far in advance that, uh, this has been in the making for four years,  where we had Stalker Patty getting thrown out of places to live.  That was all just a scheme.  None of that changed the fact that, uh, yeah, it was, uh, great radio, if not honest.  And, uh, he talks about the publicity, including this column, uh, that we got out of it,  and the listeners during the year's, uh, biggest ratings sweep of the year. 
[00:10:30]  Of course, the, uh, spring ratings book, uh, speaking of, Dean, let it, let it go.  You have nothing.  Dean, like we say in the show from time to time to guests and callers, you have nothing.  Dean, you want to look into people knowing stuff?  Look into, um, you know, the White House and the government, knowing about September 11th  before that happened.  Right.  There's something.  Run with that.  You have nothing.  There's something with a little more substance than the Eddie thing.  And you know why you have nothing?  Because Ant and I are smarter than you. 
[00:11:00]  That's right, Dean.  I challenge you to try to find something.  Uh, you're not going to find it.  There you go.  Interview Eddie.  It'll be fun.  We can have cotton candy and hot dogs together.  All right.  We got to move on.  We got lots to do on the show today, Anthony.  Oh, my goodness, don't we?  Did you hear what's going on with, um, Eminem?  Yeah.  Putting his, uh, new album out.  When the hell is that coming out?  Uh, in early June, I think.  And apparently it's like one of the most secretive, um, record debuts ever. 
[00:11:30]  Like, they really tied this thing up, uh, to where they didn't want it leaking out or  anything, because, um, I guess past albums have leaked out, so the security on this one  is bigger than any other album debut ever.  Right.  I hear, what is this article?  It says that, uh, MTV.com is reporting.  I'll read this, Ant.  Okay.  You did a good job, uh, reading the, the newspaper article there.  Thank you, Welfi.  You do the hook it on for Honex, work it for me. 
[00:12:00]  From, uh, MTV.com, uh, it says, few albums have been as closely guarded as Eminem's The  Eminem Show, Anthony.  Mm-hmm.  No one at, at, no one at Interscope Records has a personal copy, and journalists who want  to review it have to go to special listening sessions where representatives from the rapper's  management deliver the disc, sit through the sessions, and then take the record back to  keep it out of enemy hands.  Wow.  They don't want this thing leaked out at all, man.  I wonder if they check them for, like, recording devices or something.  They probably do. 
[00:12:30]  They scan them.  Despite such, uh, precautions, all 20 songs were leaked to the internet by, uh, May 11th,  a full three weeks before the disc release date.  Jesus.  The tracks are available on various file-sharing services, plus bootleg vendors began selling  the CD on the streets of New York for $5 this weekend.  Yo, fat-ala, fat-ala.  No one's happy about it, but it's very hard to prevent it, Interscope spokesperson said.  He pointed out that Korn's Untouchables CD was leaked a full two months before its release  date.  Wow.  And who did that, Anthony?  Opie and Anthony. 
[00:13:00]  Opie and Anthony.  That's right.  Yeah.  So, it's really tough to get a copy of this thing.  Yeah.  It's guarded.  And there's so many, uh, curses in it, I hear, that it would be very difficult to,  uh, play on the air, because all the curses.  Yeah, who would have the time to try to, you know, come up with a clean edit?  Because that's what happens with these albums, you know?  Yeah, I heard there was, like, one song on it, something like 26 or 30, uh, curse words,  and you can't have a production guy sitting there, because you can't bleep it, you can't 
[00:13:30]  just take it out, it ruins the song, so I think they have a good strategy here as far  as, uh, radios breaking it.  Right.  Um, before their release date.  Right.  Because there's no radio edit out there for it.  You could download it off the web, but there's so many curses that you can't play it on the  air.  Correct, Anthony.  Yeah.  So, well, uh, it's time to play, uh, piss off all the radio stations that think they're  cool.  It's the leak and release segment of the Opie and Anthony show.  Yes.  No other radio station has the balls to play this, Anthony. 
[00:14:00]  Hey, when's the other station, uh, debuting this one?  Uh, weeks from now.  Weeks from now.  Weeks from now.  Oh, if you listen closely, you'll hear gold records smashing on the floor during this  little segment over, uh, across the street as the Abercrombie and Fitch Midgett gets really  pissed at this one.  Better known as the worst program director in America.  Look up the ratings today, Steve.  Here it is.  Guess what station beats you from 3 p.m. to midnight now?  The world's debut of the new Eminem album. 
[00:14:30]  From the CD, the Eminem show.  Let's get right into this.  This is White America.  America!  Holy S does that rock.  That's pretty good.  That's White America from Eminem's new CD, the Eminem show.  The problem, the, uh, CD's not available for, I don't know, two or three more weeks, Anthony.  No, but we're debuting it here.  The world premiere on our leak and release, uh, segment of our program. 
[00:15:00]  Of, uh, a few tracks from the new Eminem CD, the Eminem show.  Until they get to us, Anthony.  Proving all those other radio stations that think they're cool.  Oh, we're the coolest station in the city.  Shout out.  And in two weeks, we'll have it for you here first.  Whatever.  You guys are a bunch of pussies and you know it.  That's what the fun part is.  Just tooling them.  Here's another track called Business.  Eminem from the Eminem show.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  World premiere, baby.  Marshall.  Sounds like an SOS.  Holy whack.  Thank you for coming. 
[00:15:30]  Your host for the evening.  Marshall.  Nice.  Hell yeah.  That sounds great too, man.  Eminem and business off the Eminem show.  It's the world premiere on the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  Who is that?  Dre in there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like that.  What do we got now?  Track 12?  You want to go with track 12?  Yeah.  With the Dream On little riff there?  Sing for the moment.  Samples Aerosmith's Dream On.  Off of Eminem's The Eminem Show.  World premiere right here on the Opie and Anthony show.  You're checking out the world premiere of the new Eminem CD, The Eminem Show. 
[00:16:00]  Right.  Only on the Opie and Anthony show.  Boy, I'm reading reviews coming in, Opie.  They either love it or hate it.  Sing for the moment.  Yeah.  With Dream On sampled in there.  That was nice.  I'm loving it, Ant.  That sounds pretty good.  I'm totally loving it.  The people that aren't digging it, you know, you've got to realize part of the reason we're  playing this is to piss people off across the street. 
[00:16:30]  Well, it's just a segment we like doing from time to time.  Piss off all the radio stations that think they're really cool.  They sit there for weeks saying, we're going to be the first to play it.  We just like throwing a monkey wrench into their works.  Dude, how good is that?  All those songs.  I really like it.  I'm amazed.  Jim Norton, an Eminem fan.  I love Eminem.  I really do.  And Dr. Dre, I think, is brilliant.  Well, when he comes here with a gun pointing at you, you can tell him.  I don't think they send letters like legal letters.  I think they just send big black guys with guns. 
[00:17:00]  And big suburbans.  Yeah, that's it.  We're going to leave tonight and there'll be these big suburbans with the tinted windows  following all of our cars.  I'm the bald guy.  Leave Jimmy alone.  The songs really are good, man.  Well, there's three from the album.  Yeah.  The Eminem show.  You want to do another one, Ant?  No, which one is everyone clamoring for?  I kind of dig Superman.  A lot of people want to hear Say What You Will.  Let's go with track 13.  All right.  From the Eminem show.  It's Eminem and Superman, Anthony. 
[00:17:30]  It's the world exclusive.  Of course it is.  On the Opie and Anthony show.  Right.  It's the world premiere of the new Eminem CD, the Eminem show, Anthony.  There you go.  There's a fourth song that we've world premiered.  That one, uh...  Superman.  The lyrics are very funny.  I love when he's just smacking the bitches.  Right.  But, uh, the music I found a little monotonous.  Oh, you didn't like that one as much as the other thing we played?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:18:00]  Oh, that's too bad.  Yeah.  The lyrics, though, are very funny.  I like when he's telling them to kiss his, uh...  And he wants to give you of them.  Well, we had to clean it up a little bit.  I understand.  You can figure out what he's saying there, right?  Of course you can.  I really didn't want to like Eminem either.  Yeah?  Yeah, I really didn't want to, but how can you not like him?  All he does is want to smash women, and he's just the greatest.  And he's good.  The music is good.  Classic.  All right.  And he puts his fists where his mouth is when it comes to the bitches. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, but everyone's so politically correct.  It's just so great to hear someone say that stuff, man.  All right.  Well, we've got to take a break, Ant.  Yes, we do.  We have the new Eminem CD, the Eminem show.  World premiering it for everybody.  Of course we are.  Because your cool station in the city, they don't have the balls to do this.  It's pretty sad.  It's really sad, actually.  They play by all the rules that are laid down.  They act all tough and stuff.  By some of the same companies that F us over.  So this is a little, this is what we like to call payback. 
[00:19:00]  A little payback from your pals.  O&A.  How you liking it?  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Outside of New York City, 866-277.  For a while, we've got to take a quick break.  On the way, we've got the retarded Laverne Shirley coming in to play that movie thing again.  Yeah, a movie.  Success the first time.  Guy movies.  They're going to be doing some dialogue from some famous scenes from guy movies.  And I guess we're going to give out a few prizes if you can guess which scenes they're doing. 
[00:19:30]  That's right.  Also, Andrew Gore right around the corner.  Our new friend from the D.C. area, Anthony.  Is he bringing goodies?  Oh, he's bringing a lot of new stuff that we haven't seen.  And a few gifts as well.  Very cool.  I think he's doing the tattoo show at Roseland this weekend.  So we'll step aside.  We'll be back.  Don't be an a-hole.  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go after yourself, Opie.  Hey, Mike, what's going on? 
[00:20:00]  Opie and Anthony, you guys are awesome for doing this.  Doing what?  What?  Playing these songs.  I can't believe it.  What songs?  What?  I don't know what you're talking about.  I don't understand how you don't get in trouble.  I mean, I...  What do you mean?  Are there fines or the station or what?  What?  Huh?  Huh?  I don't know what you're talking about.  What do we do?  But...  What?  Why are there no repercussions?  I mean, I love it.  And I support it. 
[00:20:30]  Good.  But does this know anything to answer to?  Huh?  What?  We're just playing some tracks off the new Eminem CD.  The Eminem show.  Why not?  Because...  I don't know.  That's what I'm asking.  I mean, it hasn't been released.  So does that mean that...  Why wouldn't everyone else play it?  Because I'm...  What's a release date, really, anyway?  Why wait for something when you have it now?  Right.  If it's there, why not just put it out there?  See what the people think.  It's like...  Hey, you...  It's like you have a really nice steak on your kitchen table, but, oh, you can't eat it 
[00:21:00]  until, I don't know, a week from now.  I like getting the people's reaction a little bit.  Yeah, you guys were the ones who put your finger in the icing and you got your hands  slapped from your mother.  Well, we did the same thing with Korn and then MTV reported and everyone else.  And then all these stations that think they're cool had to backtrack and still make believe  they were playing the Korn tracks first, even though everyone knows they weren't.  Oh, well.  Hey, I got another question, though.  When you guys...  I guess it was Anthony, thank the radio gods. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah, go ahead.  Was that...  Were you referring to Don and Mike's time slot in Washington, D.C., taking it to number one?  We did well in D.C.  We got a lot of support down there, it's looking like.  That's it.  All right, thank you, bro.  Thank you, bro.  Bye.  Yeah, when we went down there, it was insane.  In the parking lot.  Yeah, let's go to Tom.  The phones have just exploded.  Tom, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  You guys are killing me.  Why?  I've been dealing with Rick lately and Garrett sending him, I sent him the new Rush, the  new Moby and Pop Road stuff, you know? 
[00:22:00]  I got this Eminem thing last week.  We decided to blow off the new Rush.  We had that a month ago.  Yeah, no, I hear you.  We're picky.  I just got this.  When we do this leak and release thing.  What?  We're picky with this leak and release thing.  Yeah, just because it's there, we don't want to release it.  I hear you, but I got it online.  It's got to serve our purposes.  You guys have been playing it.  I got 40 people in queue downloading.  Oh, really?  I'm going nuts, dude.  It's sucking up all my throughput.  Nice.  All my throughput.  How's your throughput?  It's kind of hot. 
[00:22:30]  Later, guys.  All right, Tom.  Well.  Well, we got a...  Did we get a...  Oh.  Oh.  What is that?  I saw a logo on top of that page.  Three logos.  It's a...  Yeah, three logos I see on top of that page.  That's a fax, but unfortunately, I don't know how to read.  Is it a little too dark to read?  Is that what happened?  It's not a good copy of the fax?  Via faxsmile...  Faxsmile.  ...and certified mail. 
[00:23:00]  Really?  Return receipt requested.  What?  Referring the M-I-N-M.  The M-I-N-M.  M-I-N-M show.  Who can?  Who can?  Phonics.  Oh, Phonics.  What, God?  What, God?  For me.  Me.  Me.  Me.  Hmm.  Interesting.  Interesting.  Oh, look at the CCs on that.  Oh, we got the Abercrombie and Fitch Midget checking in.  Yes, sir!  Okay.  I am really, really pissed at you guys. 
[00:23:30]  Let me run down the past five minutes for you.  As I was playing my game at Half-Life...  No jokes, please.  One of the many DJs I never put on the air came to my office.  So I had to hop down off my booster seat.  And what do you think I hear?  What?  You guys playing stuff that we should be playing at VMA League.  Well, you don't have the balls to play.  You guys had it, too, I bet.  Well, it's not our fault.  I'm going to come over and I'm just going to bite your kneecaps off.  And then Rich Foster's going to join me because he's the only other midget that I know.  You're still trying to dress younger so you don't fight off that middle age, are you? 
[00:24:00]  Well, it's no longer Abercrombie and Fitch.  I now shop at Gap Kids.  Kids, very good.  I find this stuff fits a little bit better.  And I see more people that look like me.  And I see the DJs working in the mall that I keep off the air.  Do you realize you could be the worst program director in America, right?  Thanks today, sir.  Excuse me?  Did you read the good news for this radio station and the bad news for your station?  Oh, I'm sorry, but that fact was a little blurred.  Here's something that will not be reported in the press. 
[00:24:30]  And now we're talking just to New York.  Sorry to the other markets.  But I think you could relate in some fashion here.  I don't think you want to say this.  We got a little ratings thing today.  A little ratings thing.  Uh-huh.  Opie and Anthony's show doing much more gooder in New York.  Not just more gooder.  Much more gooder.  Much more gooder.  And not only is the Opie and Anthony show doing much more gooder.  Yeah.  The Ron and Fez show that follows us here in New York City.  And they're doing even much more gooder. 
[00:25:00]  Much more gooder than they were doing.  Right.  Yes.  And this is something that won't be reported, unfortunately, because David Hinckley and the  rest of the radio critics in New York would rather write about something no one else cares about.  Yes.  But between the hours of 3, that's the start of our show, and the end of Ron and Fez's show,  which is midnight, 11?  11.  11?  Yeah.  Okay.  This radio station, WNEW in New York, has more listeners than K-Rock.  Right.  Beating K-Rock. 
[00:25:30]  I didn't quite hear any of that.  Beating K-Rock from 3 to midnight, basically.  That is a huge news story that won't be reported.  No.  There you go.  This bombed-out wreck is beating K-Rock.  See, I have no comment about that.  We're going to be switching to an all-new format anyway.  What's that?  Really?  Yes.  I'm sure our fans are going to like this music.  If you get a good listen to it, it's got a really good beat. 
[00:26:00]  Now, what do you think about that, guys?  You think that music can fit into a new format?  What is it?  You're not familiar with Paul Davidson, 65, Love Affair?  I mean, the fans are really going to go wild for that.  Our DJs will be back on the air only for three minutes per hour.  Run with it.  Great.  By the way, Mr. Abercrombie and Fitch Midget, you know how you were bragging behind the  scenes that your boys were nipping on the heels of Opie and Anthony?  Oh, my God.  Eh, wrong again, douche! 
[00:26:30]  Well, give him advice.  Just let Kane, you know, do what he does.  Do what he does very well.  He plays music and talks about rock.  Does it well.  He doesn't have to do shtick.  Well, since the 80s-type genre is going good, we're going to go a little bit deeper into the  80s.  We're going to get that target segment that is obviously not being affected.  I mean, we know you guys have that male demographic.  Oh, boy.  So we're going after the other male demographic.  See, this is trying too hard now.  I'm going to talk to the guy, not the character. 
[00:27:00]  This could be a really good character for our show, but you've got to know when to punch  out.  You've got to punch out.  Okay, bye.  There you go.  But that's huge news for the station today.  Yes.  Between 3 and midnight, we are beating K-Rod.  Yeah.  Here in New York City.  How about that?  Half the day.  Good job, Steve.  Good job.  Good job.  Good job.  Good show.  Good job.  You pompous ass.  Well, our fun has come to an end. 
[00:27:30]  It looks that way.  I hate when this happens.  We shouldn't have played commercials.  We could have got another two or three tracks in.  It has come to our attention that you are in possession of an illegal, unauthorized copy  of the above-named album, The Eminem Show.  Aftermath.  Aftermath.  What?  Aftermath.  Shady.  Interscope Records is the exclusive owner of this album. 
[00:28:00]  Anthony, off The Eminem Show.  This is Say Goodbye to Hollywood.  Another track from The Eminem Show.  It's the world premiere of the new Eminem CD, Anthony.  Yeah.  Say Goodbye, Hollywood.  The fifth track we're world premiering on The Opie and Anthony Show today.  Great.  Now, I interrupted you.  You were reading something over there?  I was reading something.  I didn't know if it was an official fax there or I wouldn't have interrupted you.  I'm sorry, sir. 
[00:28:30]  Should I continue or...  Yeah, start from the beginning.  All right.  It has come to our attention that you are in possession of an illegal, unauthorized copy  of the above-named album.  And it says The Eminem Show up there.  The album, Aftermath, Shady, Interscope Records, is the exclusive owner of this album.  This album, other than the single entitled Without Me, has not yet been released, nor has it  been distributed for promotional exploitation. 
[00:29:00]  It has come to our attention that you have, slash, intend to broadcast recordings from  such album.  Are they talking about music?  Jesus.  Legal mumbo-jumbo.  Please be advised that you have no authority to so broadcast any recordings off of this  album, other than without me.  And your doing so constitutes willful copyright infringement of Aftermath, Shady, Interscope  Records' exclusive rights.  Then it says, We hereby demand that you immediately, and here's the phrase, cease and desist from 
[00:29:30]  any further use of the unreleased songs off this album.  We intend to hold you fully liable to the full extent of the law, Opie, for any unauthorized  broadcast of these unreleased songs or otherwise.  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to operate as a waiver or limitation of our  rights and remedies at law or in equity or otherwise, all of which are hereby expressly  reserved.  Very truly yours. 
[00:30:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  What's the translation of that last paragraph?  Nothing contained herein shall be construed to operate as a waiver or limitation of our rights.  Oh, so you can't interpret what was just read as some kind of a little loophole to play  it.  You can't figure out a way that this is worded to say, well, it allows me to do this.  Oh.  I think.  Okay.  Yeah.  They have soul rights. 
[00:30:30]  And, Opie, once again, you should have your fanny spanked and so shall I.  What's wrong with Ben?  Oh, all right.  Shame on us.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  I'm slapping my wrist.  Look at us being outrageous.  Oh.  Oh.  We're so outrageous.  All right.  We got to take a break.  We got Satan's side show.  Yeah.  Andrew Gore is here.  Why are you laughing?  What's up?  That's what you're laughing at? 
[00:31:00]  Oh, they completely stopped him in the lobby and was wondering about him.  That's why they came up.  A security guy came up here all panicky.  I'm like, oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, really?  Is it Dr. Dre?  That's a freak up?  I thought it was Dre, yeah.  I'm thinking it's Dr. Dre or something.  With a machine gun.  Or one of his boys.  Instead, it's Andrew Gore looking all freaky downstairs.  Oh, were they my niggas?  Ben, buck, buck, buck.  So, one of the security guys holds up a sign.  Satan's side show?  Should we let him up?  I'm like, yeah.  It's Dr. Andrew.  Oh, yeah, sure.  Might look a little strange, but he's harmless. 
[00:31:30]  Well, that's all part of the whole Satan's side show thing.  And also, some lady is outside the studio.  Dr. Dot.  Dr. Dot?  I guess she banged Bruce Willis.  What?  Stop it.  An Indian doctor?  Why is she shaking her head?  No.  Opie, what are you...  Uh-oh, why is she doing this, Rick?  What did you do?  I don't know.  Did I just reen it?  See, you have a knack of reen in this.  Did I just reen your sport?  Go talk to her real fast.  Go talk to her.  Make sure everything's okay.  Before you take a break. 
[00:32:00]  Because as Opie has said, you know, I don't know what you're talking about, Opie, about  that, but she seems to have been a masseuse for many famous rock bands and whatnot.  And she may have jumped on Bruce's hog.  Oh, sorry.  Yes, Rick?  Well, that's not her claim to fame.  Yes.  But it happened?  But it's in a book, yeah, that she wrote.  Okay.  Nice.  Okay.  So what is she going to talk about, this book?  And other people in her life. 
[00:32:30]  There's a whole list of people in there.  Oh, right.  Oh, man, look how weird Andrew Gore looks today.  I think he's doing a little OCD thing today.  Well, this is pretty far away for him, isn't it?  Yeah.  And isn't he kind of agoraphobic, where he kind of just stays home?  Yeah.  Yep.  Wow.  Now he's in big New York City.  That must have freaked him out.  Anthony, we're also, for some reason, getting a lot of requests for the Sergeant Hartman  crank calls.  I don't know why.  We've been playing these damn things for months.  Oh, my God.  So, all right.  If you want to hear it, we'll play him into break here. 
[00:33:00]  Sure.  Check this out, and we'll continue.  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  My name is Dick.  That name sounds like royalty.  Are you royalty?  Ah.  Do you suck a...  What?  Do you suck a...  Yeah.  I bet you could suck a golf ball through a garden hole.  Jerry, my ritual, man.  Talk to like on the phone, man.  What you doing, man?  You don't hear me.  Hello.  What's your name, scumbag?  Raj.  Well, no... 
[00:33:30]  Come on, sir.  Talk to like on the...  Seriously.  Hello?  Don't fuck yourself, or I will unscrew your head and fuck on your neck.  I...  What's that?  Do you think I'm cute?  Do you think I'm funny?  Who?  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.  Fuck your sister.  What, you little magnet?  You make me want to vomit.  I...  Ah!  Are you about to call me an ass?  Who are you?  Silver Pyle.  Huh?  Silver Pyle.  I don't understand.  Who are you? 
[00:34:00]  Silver Pyle.  Huh?  Who are you?  No.  I'm not a...  Who are you?  You must un...  yourself, or I will unscrew your head and fuck on your neck.  Anytime.  Okay?  Come on, let's go.  Ah!  One, two, three.  Bye.  Welcome to the bottomless cage of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:34:30]  That thing's hilarious.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  A lot of excitement around the studio today.  Oh my goodness gracious.  Lawyers hotlining us.  People downstairs with mysterious packages.  There is so much going on.  We have a masseuse that is hotter than hot outside the studio.  Yeah.  We have Andrew Gore.  The retard Laverne Shirley are going to be here in an hour.  Ah, how could you say something hot and then go to them? 
[00:35:00]  Ah, just add a...  Even out the hotness.  Even out that hotness?  We...  Did you see everybody clamoring over their Pam Anderson pictures?  Yep.  We just got him in and I'm very happy with mine.  And Norton is just ecstatic.  He goes, look how good this looks.  Look how hot she looks.  You're all pissed off at the way you look in it.  This masseuse doctor is so sexy. 
[00:35:30]  Really?  She's beyond sexy.  It's...  She masseuses all the stars in Hollywood.  It brings out every ounce of self-hatred I have.  Really?  Yeah.  And then she had a little thing with Bruce that she doesn't really want to talk about much.  So hot.  Really?  She's got stories out there.  Really.  Wazoo.  Really?  Yeah.  Wow, what is that?  That's her photo album.  Wow, that's a big photo album.  That's her...  I don't know what you call it.  I guess it...  Wow, there she is.  She has her portfolio.  Steven Tyler. 
[00:36:00]  She has some biting technique she wants to try on us.  Who is...  Who is that?  That's her naked, no?  Look at that.  She's got everyone.  Rayman Zerk at the doors.  They're a Frank Zappa.  Backstage passes all over this album.  Look at her all painted up in penthouse.  Wow, that's her naked with just body paint on her?  Get an autograph from David Bowie.  Look at here.  Newspaper.  Get the stinky cam on for this today, man.  Oh, yeah.  Who else? 
[00:36:30]  I can't really see.  Oh, there's Bruce Willis, I guess, huh?  She's got a lot of newspaper clippings and...  Boy, is she hot.  She's really hot.  Fire that up.  Ginger Baker from Cream.  Really?  More pictures of her completely naked.  Nice.  Whoa!  Oh!  Hey.  Will she give us a little something-something?  Look at that.  Hopefully.  A little something-something?  Those are hot pictures.  There she is massaging Bruce Willis' foot.  Will she give us a little peek-a-boo?  Probably.  A little peek? 
[00:37:00]  Oh, she's so sexy.  She's really hot.  But first, Anthony...  She's nice, too.  You can't even trash her.  But first, because he's freaking out out there, I think we need to get Andrew in here.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's all itchy and stuff.  Keith Richards, Alice Cooper.  All right.  Rick, take the book away.  Where's Ozzy?  I think he needs to see the naked one.  Well, good.  Show him outside.  Perverts.  There he is, Andrew Gore.  And he's got a box with him.  SatanSideshow.com.  How you doing, man?  Doing great.  You got a box with you? 
[00:37:30]  I see that.  A box of goodies.  Our new friend that we met in D.C. a week ago today, Anthony.  Yes.  You're in town for the tattoo show at Roseland, right?  Yeah, the big New York City annual tattoo show.  Okay.  I can't see you, Andrew.  Oh.  It's behind all kinds of hardware.  We usually put the guests there that we're going to mess with.  I don't want to mess with Andrew.  Hey, North, do you want to move that stinky cam over there?  It's right in front of you.  Sure, Andrew.  There you go.  What do you want it to tell you?  Right here?  I'll just point it.  Are you going to put it on Andrew?  I don't know.  And you want your face on the...  Yeah.  On the Internet? 
[00:38:00]  Norton, what you got to do is...  Yeah, there you go.  Norton has the thing facing down, and he doesn't even know.  You're pretty technologically inept.  I thought that was the camera thing.  Did you?  The part that you screw into a tripod?  Yeah, I did.  I hear a pisser.  It's upside down now.  Dude, leave the technology to Steve.  Isn't that great?  What do I know, dude?  There you go.  Perfect.  He'll leave the silliness to you.  You leave the technology to him.  Okay?  He won't try to be silly. 
[00:38:30]  It's Andrew Gore.  You know what I meant to ask you when I met you?  Right.  You got that mustache like G.G. Allen's brother.  Yeah.  Is that the reason you do that type of mustache, or...?  Original...  No, not G.G. Allen's brother, G.G. Allen.  Yeah.  G.G. Allen had it like that?  G.G. Allen has it like this...  Merle had the opposite.  He had like the little...  He had the Hitler mustache.  He had the Hitler mustache.  Oh, that's right.  You have the opposite Hitler.  I got the anti-Hitler mustache.  We have the mustache, but the middle of it where the Hitler part would be is shaved out.  Completely shaved out.  And the beard in the middle is shaved out.  Yeah, the beard in the middle is shaved out, and then you've got it kind of twisted at 
[00:39:00]  the ends in a very satanic fashion.  Yes.  Now, if you didn't hear Andrew on our show when we were broadcasting live from D.C., the  guy collects everything.  This is the kind of stuff we are completely into.  We're fascinated by this stuff.  Pickled punks is a favorite subject of ours, and we find out we have a collector right here  of some famous pickled punks.  Yeah, I got a few little pickled pals hanging around.  Pickled little buddies.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, we were talking about them the other day.  Yeah, yeah.  Very nice.  Well, we saw the one that you brought to when we were broadcasting from D.C.  The Cyclops baby.  The Cyclops baby.  One-eyed baby with the nose growing out of its forehead.  It looked like a little pig snout, and it had no nose on the front of its face and  one eye.  And it's just floating in this fluid in a huge jar.  It was a full-term baby, right?  Full-term, aha.  Yeah, it wasn't just an embryo.  And its hair is the most fascinating thing.  It's so fine, and it looks like if you felt it, it would feel like a newborn baby's hair. 
[00:40:00]  And that pickled punk is how old?  About 80 years.  80 years old, sitting there suspended in time.  I like the water seal boy.  The water-headed seal boy.  He was telling me about this.  Water-headed seal boy.  What kind of birth defect causes this?  Describe him a little bit.  It's like a little baby with like a worm body.  It looks like little lobster claws for hands and feet.  And a head. 
[00:40:30]  Huge head.  As big as the body.  Really?  And it looks like a cantaloupe.  And the head's growing out of like the back kind of.  Yeah.  Because like if you just like, you know.  I mean, it looks like a hand.  Tilt your head up toward the ceiling.  That's how he looks all the time.  You know what I picture?  Remember a little sweepy from the Popeye cartoons?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And it was always wrapped up, and you can never see arms or legs.  It would just crawl around like that.  Kind of like that.  Kind of like that.  Kind of like that.  Only really disgusting and not the least bit cute.  The detail on the face, unbelievable.  Really?  Unbelievable.  What's the expression like? 
[00:41:00]  Do it for me.  No, I ain't.  Do the expression.  Do the expression.  No.  Just be a pal.  Come on.  I need a little reference.  Jimmy can do it because his face is fatter.  But I never saw a little shoe boy.  You need like a fat face like yourself, and then you kind of just stretch it.  Oh, it's like a stretched thing like this?  Yeah, it's all stretched.  Is it like this?  Kind of.  Yeah.  With the eyes closed.  A little death stare.  I just have to point out that my face is fat while the doctor's in the building.  Oh, it's getting thinner.  Blowing up your spot.  Yeah.  I'm trying to like sit with my chest out and my stomach in. 
[00:41:30]  Hello, Doc.  It almost looks like you have a chin again.  Yeah.  I'm going to sit across from her.  No profile shots.  She's really hot.  You see that?  See the doctor out there?  Dr. Doc?  Oh, yeah.  Gorgeous, right?  Very nice.  And then, you know, I've got to say it again.  The Siamese twins and the fish tank with the diapers on.  That sounds great.  Oh, my God.  That's the pinnacle of the whole collection.  We're just hoping.  That was by the most famous one.  Really?  We're just hoping someday, through Andrew,  that we could bring back the real sideshow.  Yeah.  Really put on a display, 
[00:42:00]  because this stuff used to be on display at all the circuses.  And people still want to see this.  Believe me, they do.  But we've gotten so politically correct  that it seems like you're exploiting something  if you're showing these medical oddities,  which is just, you know, people want to see it.  People want to see it.  Of course they do.  It's sexy.  You sick bastard.  It's like most of the sideshows now  are just working acts.  Sword swallowers, fire eaters.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like talent.  It's not just an affliction.  Right.  I want to see a flipper boy and a... 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And, you know...  What happened to that...  A little face lady and...  Alligator skin guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And then he married the hairy face woman.  Oh, Priscilla and Emmett.  Yeah.  Priscilla's now dead.  That's a great story.  Yeah, they're both dead, yeah.  She finally died.  Yeah.  Didn't she shave her face or something?  Because I saw on a special,  and it was like she shaved her face  and you were kind of like...  Kind of looked hotter with the fuzz on her face.  Was she awful?  Awful.  Yeah.  Yeah, she was really bad.  Imagine that awful stubble kissing that.  Why would you marry him?  Because it was alligator skin guy.  His whole body was covered with like scales  that looked like alligator skin. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, it's called itchitosis.  Itchitosis?  Yep, and his skin was constantly flaking off.  That's great stuff.  Huh?  Did it itch?  I don't know.  Back in the old days,  they had like the sideshows  where the legless and bodiless people  where they just had...  The half woman.  The half a torso?  That's the half woman.  Yeah, like Johnny Eck.  Yeah, I got Johnny Eck tattooed on my forearm.  Yeah, now how much of that guy actually was body?  Like, did he have lower area for reproducing or...?  It is...  I've never...  I never asked him, but...  Hey, how's your junk?  But I talked to somebody who's... 
[00:43:30]  who knew him,  and he did have some junk down there.  Really?  Yeah.  And the woman also,  she looked like...  Whenever you saw her...  Oh, Jeannie.  I swear to God,  it looked like right under the ribcage.  Feel where your ribcage is.  That's where it looked like it was cut off.  Yeah.  And did she have any working parts?  Jeannie Tolmany?  Yeah.  Yeah, she had kids.  She did have kids.  Yeah.  Like, if you ever saw that movie Freaks,  and that was filmed in 1932...  She was in that movie?  No, no, no.  No, but there was a guy, Prince Randian,  who was the human torso. 
[00:44:00]  A black guy with the earrings.  He had no arms, no legs.  Kind of just kind of slithered around like a worm.  Oh, he was in Freaks in a very creepy scene where...  Yeah, he was in Freaks.  He was coming after the guy.  Yeah, and he was married and had five children.  You've got to explain the movie Freaks to people that don't know.  It was a black and white film done in the...  What year do you think?  It was a black and white film that was filmed by Todd Browning,  the same guy that made Dracula.  Kind of an eclectic director of the time.  And it was based on a book by... 
[00:44:30]  What was it called?  By Todd Spurs or whatever.  And it was filmed in 32.  And it was banned as soon as it came out.  And it...  Just a bunch of freaks.  Yeah, like Freaks.  It's start Freaks.  It's real Freaks.  It's real humanodities.  None of...  You know, no prosthetics.  No, this is like the real...  Made Freaks.  Where did he gather them all up?  Just various circus acts and carnivals.  Because he had all the biggies, man.  He had one of the pinheads.  Yeah, I got the pinhead right here tattooed on my arm.  Pinhead.  You know what?  How did they cure that?  They didn't. 
[00:45:00]  You just don't see him anymore, though.  With a hammer.  How did...  With a kick to the uterus.  How do you...  Really?  They haven't cured that?  Maybe they have tests now where you see it in pregnancy.  I'm sure they have tests and they can get rid of it or...  You can kind of flush it out of the system there.  What is it?  It's like a...  It's called microcephalic.  Yeah, and they...  Look at the picture.  You've seen stuff like that.  Pinheads.  It looks like their regular part of their face is a little bigger.  And their crania, the part where you'd have your brain in, is just little.  It's almost non-existent. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah, they're retarded.  They have about the intelligence of a three-year-old.  But Schlitzie, the pinhead, that's what the comic book Zippy was pretty based on.  I remember that.  But she was the original, but it was really a boy.  A lot of people don't know that.  Was it?  It wasn't a chick?  It was not a chick.  Wow.  Imagine the surprise.  You see something hot like that and you take her out for a date and it's a guy.  How awful.  But they needed to be diapered.  Did they?  So that's why they wore dresses because it's just easier to change your diapers. 
[00:46:00]  Oh, who knew that?  You have to bill them as females.  Right.  And then I like how they accentuate the point on the head by putting that little piece  of hair.  Yeah.  You should do that to Stalker Patty when you shave her hair.  Oh, make her a pinhead.  Give her a little pinhead with a little bow in it.  Put her in a dress and a diaper.  I'd hire her in a heartbeat.  Her hair comes off at halftime of the Celebrity Softball.  I got to tell you, man, all the people that promised us money have backed out on us.  Have they?  So once again, you and I will be flipping the bill.  Did they back out or they just haven't said anything yet? 
[00:46:30]  You know, a few people said they were coming by with the money.  Yeah, and they never did.  I got a hundred.  I'm chipping in.  Right.  Chipping in.  Chipping.  Andrew, you want to be part of the softball game?  Oh, no.  You said you had something going on.  I have a show, but I'm working on getting there somehow.  Okay.  And his website's great.  SatanSideshow.com.  A lot of our listeners have started buying your t-shirts.  Oh, man, your listeners are insane.  Yeah.  It was great.  You have a great selection of shirts and stuff on the website.  There's so much freaky stuff, and it's right up our audience's alley. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, it's great.  I get a lot of emails saying, where's the pictures of the sick stuff?  And I'm just like, I do all this stuff alone, and I just put the website up,  and I had no idea this was even going to go on with the O&A show.  And so by next week, there'll be pictures up there.  So stop emailing me and saying, where's that seal boy at?  Now you're going to get 20,000 more emails saying.  Well, why don't we take a quick break.  Yes.  And when we get back, you're going to show us all the new stuff you brought in?  Yeah, I brought some new stuff.  A few goodies. 
[00:47:30]  Some goodies to check out from his private collection, Anthony.  And then I think we're also going to invite the hot masseuse in here as well.  Yeah.  All right.  What happened, Jimmy?  I just looked at her outside.  She changed clothes.  Wow.  She changed it to what?  Wow-wee.  Into her masseuse nurse outfit.  Oh, a nurse thing?  Oh, boy.  Not into the nurse thing.  You're not?  No.  You will be.  Have you seen a chick that hot lately?  Just patty, man.  Patty. 
[00:48:00]  All right.  More with Andrew Gord.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's like listening to Corky and Cara M. Quinlan.  Opie and Anthony.  I'd rather hear my penis in a vice than listen to those two.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  We're back with The Opie and Anthony Show.  No, you're back.  I've been here.  You've been away.  You should have heard what I just heard.  Did you get an earful of something, Opie? 
[00:48:30]  What happened?  I just took one for the team.  You were on the, um, bond?  What happened?  Deny, deny, deny, deny, deny, deny.  Look, I did not have sex with that woman.  Not ever.  None on us.  Look, I'm going to say this one more time.  And I want you all to listen.  Is it getting ugly?  None on us.  Give me an ugly factor.  Pick an ugly celebrity and give me the ugly factor of how bad the situation is. 
[00:49:00]  Going from, I don't know, Kirsten Dunst as being, like, the really hot side.  Yeah, yeah.  And, like, no, I hear you.  Like, Phyllis Diller.  No, no, I got it.  Is it Phyllis Diller ugly?  At this point, you and I are, um, Bonnie Blake.  It's Bonnie Blake.  Oh, my God.  It's Bonnie Blake ugly.  Ha-ha.  Oh, we saw those pictures.  Uh-oh.  With Super GM Ken Stevens being the trigger man. 
[00:49:30]  Are we in the doghouse with Ken?  We were in his good graces because we had some ratings news for an hour.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  One hour, he was happy with it.  Unfortunately, I can't share on this one.  Oh.  And we share a lot with you guys.  But I'll say this much.  Yeah.  I pick up the phone and Super GM Ken Stevens goes,  Well, well, you guys have been awfully busy since I left you an hour ago.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Is he taking a lot of phone calls? 
[00:50:00]  And then I just said, what?  What?  What?  I don't know what you're talking about.  What happened?  What are you talking about?  Did he get a lot of calls?  Oh.  Okay.  How high up the ladder did it go?  Let's say the ladder is against a ten-story building and the top rung reaches the roof.  How high a level, let's just say, if you know what I mean, did some of his phone calls get?  What floor?  Let's say if there was a worker on the ladder.  Yeah.  He's in the ballerina stance on the top of the ladder. 
[00:50:30]  Oh.  On his tippy-tippy-tippy toes.  On his tippy-toes.  Ooh.  Looking at the roof.  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  Hmm.  Hmm.  What is that about us, douchebags?  Right.  It's about Andrew Gore.  Oh, yeah.  Hey.  Look at him.  Hey.  Damn you for what you did.  That's called a deflection, my friends.  P-choo.  Deflect back over here, Andrew Gore.  Yeah.  From satansideshow.com, Anthony. 
[00:51:00]  Yeah.  All right.  So, where are we?  Oh, you got a box of stuff you want to.  Box of goods?  Box of goodies.  Yeah.  At the tattoo show, I set up my Satan Sideshow.  Where is that?  That's at the Roseland Ballroom.  Roseland.  Yeah, it's huge.  It's going to be at...  All weekend, right?  It's all weekend, yeah.  It's one of the largest tattoo conventions in the country.  What is it?  They got so...  Obviously, if you're there, they got other stuff besides just tattoos.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Tattoos.  I mean, it's a big part of it, but not a whole part of it.  There's...  Piercings.  Well, he sets up a booth and what?  You sell your crazy t-shirts and stuff? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, I set up a booth.  Set up all the crazy t-shirts, the dolls, you know, the clocks, all the stuff that I make.  And the pillows and all that, right?  And the pillows and all that stuff.  Steve from FoundryMusic.com has bought, like, tons of shirts already.  Really?  Yeah.  Is he wearing one of yours right now?  The freak one?  I like that.  It's got freak t-shirts.  Nice.  With that old-style circus font.  And what I did for this show, just because I got such a good response from your fans,  I brought two freak show display boxes that you can peer into. 
[00:52:00]  And one is, I'm going to have Johnny and Joey, the two-headed kitten, on display.  And then I brought...  The two-headed kitten is amazing.  The two-headed kitten.  And then on Sunday, I'll have Cujo, the double-bodied pit bull, with the Siamese twin pit bull on display.  Wow, nice.  And these are all real.  They're not fake.  Yeah, because he was explaining that to me as well.  A lot of these side shows would kind of sew things together to make it look like something.  Oh, really?  Make it look like a twin?  Yeah, they're called gaffs.  It was real.  There are whole companies out there that just made fake carnival stuff. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah.  Fake carnival mummies and...  And I mean, I like it because there's...  There's a whole art to it, but, you know, if I'm going to buy a mummified head, I want  the real thing, you know?  Yeah.  Did I say that we love Eminem?  Yeah, why not?  I think he's a very, very talented artist.  Of course.  I really, really like Eminem.  And we will be supporting him in any way possible when his new CD is officially released. 
[00:53:00]  When's that release date?  That boy has talent.  Yes.  Yes.  June 4th, I believe.  The Eminem show.  Looking forward to it.  I can't get enough of Eminem.  Of course not.  I just want to make sure that people know that we love Eminem.  Of course.  Sorry, Andrew.  No.  I got a quick clip of Opi just on the phone.  All right.  My bad.  All right.  We love him.  Of course.  And we'll do whatever it takes. 
[00:53:30]  If we have to play every track off the album when it's officially released for a month straight,  we'll do it.  What the hell phone call did I miss?  You know, I think he's lucky I didn't get on the phone.  You know, Jim, we should explain.  You know, Ant and I have made our careers doing some crazy things.  Yes.  We like kind of getting out there in the wilderness and just kind of paving a highway type of thing.  And trudging through a tundra. 
[00:54:00]  And Norton's kind of on the outskirts with us.  He's kind of with us.  He's kind of not.  Yeah.  I support you.  I mean, I support you.  Of course.  But you should have saw him in the back office.  Dude, dude, I don't know if this is good.  I don't know, dude.  He reminds me of me when I first came aboard.  You're like Ant and I are the pavers, and you're just kind of behind us in a big SUV  just kind of taking a cruise behind us.  Yeah.  It's time you get out and help us tar the road, my friend.  I do.  Help chop some of the wild brush that we have to go through. 
[00:54:30]  I agree.  I'm more than happy to chop brush.  I just didn't want somebody with a pistol showing up going, you brush chopping mother effer,  and shooting me.  You know what?  I was discussing some things.  And I don't think from a company-wide basis they see equity in our eff-ups.  You know what I mean?  There's equity in us being retarded and screwing up.  And there are people in place that are supposed to be there to fix it. 
[00:55:00]  I don't care what anybody says.  If you play a record in advance, it helps because people hear it and want to get it.  There you go.  Well, yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  How could you not?  I'm not even being polite either.  I'd love to trash it, but I really like that song.  I think we're a very popular radio show, and we just had a 40-minute commercial.  Yeah.  Airtime on this show is very valuable.  I want to hear it.  I love Eminem, though, man.  He's really on to something.  No one tapes things off the radio anyway.  What are you going to do, tape it without the cursing? 
[00:55:30]  You want the cursing in it.  You're going to get the real TV.  Let's not mention the word tape, okay?  Let's just realize how talented Eminem is.  You can only wish we were as talented as him.  Listen to you.  Probably the most talented artist in music today, my friend.  Next to Ozzy, I'll agree with that.  No, no, you'll agree with this.  Hey, look, I'm chopping some brush here.  Lawyers fix things. 
[00:56:00]  That's their job.  All right.  We're here to get ratings.  So, Andrew, where were we?  Andrew's very confused.  Oh, Andrew, hi.  We're in an S-storm that we're trying to fight our way out of.  Crap flying everywhere.  It happens.  Hey, what's up?  And Ken goes, but I took you to lunch.  See?  I took you to lunch 40 minutes before the show.  I didn't eat your food, Ken.  And then I left to take a cab so I could go back home to D.C. and have a lovely, quiet 
[00:56:30]  night with my wife.  Thank God he's in D.C.  Why didn't you just tell me what you were up to?  I didn't want another meeting with him in his office.  I quit!  Would it have been an I quit meeting when Ken quit on it?  No, when he left his office.  This time around, he might not have that choice.  Oh, that is not true.  We love Super GM Ken Stevens.  You know, if there's a problem between a record company and this company that we work for, 
[00:57:00]  they'll figure it out.  No one's going to friggin' deny that they're going to put their video on MTV.  What artist in their right mind would go, well, we'll show them.  You can't play our video.  Please, show some balls, Viacom.  You own everything.  Don't worry about it.  A lot of people saying because of us, they're now going to go out and buy the new M&M CD.  See, there you go.  We helped.  We performed a service.  I love M&M, man. 
[00:57:30]  I don't know how anybody can be against a 40-minute commercial.  I mean, I'm ignorant, but I don't get it.  I mean, it has to do with relationships and commitments and promises made.  Why do you think I've sold out gigs because I'm on this show?  Oh, shut up, Jim.  It's business crap.  It has nothing to do with the actual music and the way people enjoy it and broadcasting it.  It has to do with the way lawyers write things.  It's a lost art.  It's a goddamn mess is what the music industry is these days.  At this point, I have a message for all the radio shows that take us in delay. 
[00:58:00]  Yeah.  You know, the ones that run us at night and stuff?  Uh-huh.  That's why the first hour of the show today was a best-of segment.  Oh, Christ.  Oh, really?  You mean Seattle won't get to it here?  No, I think Seattle's live, but like the poor folks in Sacramento.  Oh, I was thinking West Coast, Sacramento.  And Chicago and Dallas and Rochester if they decide to run the show today.  Yeah, well.  Anyway, it's not about us, though.  It's about Andrew. 
[00:58:30]  Andrew.  Andrew.  Andrew.  There you go.  Hi-ya-yous.  There you go.  Now, what have you brought for us today?  I brought some more goodies for you.  I love the goodies.  Ooh.  Poor Jimmy Norton here.  I brought my Richard Ramirez sleigh set.  Oh, it's a sleigh set.  That's a play on what?  The word play?  Sleigh, yeah.  Wah-wah.  And he puts all this stuff together.  We should tell the folks, Andrew is a really, really good artist.  Yeah, it's all handmade.  A talented artist, yeah.  And a talented and very, very tasteless artist. 
[00:59:00]  Notice he's holding a pair of eyeballs.  How cool is that?  Are you going to decorate your new apartment with the likes of that, Jimmy?  Put it on your couch.  I know.  I already have the Susan Smith snow globe.  Snow globe on top of my giant TV.  You do?  I do.  With the kids on the back.  Right.  Shake it up.  Have a laugh.  What's in the sleigh set?  Each doll has been completely hand screen printed and crafted. 
[00:59:30]  It comes with a collector's satanic certificate of authenticity.  Oh.  Each personality signed, fingerprinted, and embossed by Andrew DeGore.  Hand inlaid heavy metal spikes.  Hold an accent.  Your satanic certificate of authenticity.  Look at that thing.  Because there is nothing worse than an unaccented satanic certificate of authenticity.  He looks at that twice.  It's a great likeness of him.  Wait.  There's something in Richard's back pocket.  What?  For here, you will find the tool of the Night Stalker trade, a pair of thumb cups, and a 
[01:00:00]  blood splatter...  Ooh, this is hot.  Blood splattered cast metal exact replica of Richard's own handcuffs that were used on  one of the Stalker's children.  Really?  He handcuffed a victim and had his way with her.  And you actually have a set of those?  Yeah.  Well, no.  I mean, it's sewn on a doll.  A little miniature replica.  Of the handcuffs.  Interesting.  Okay.  And I hand splattered them with...  That took a lot of work to put that together, I gotta tell you.  He's wearing a devil shirt.  Hey, Anthony. 
[01:00:30]  Yes.  I've been doing a lot of research on Eminem for the last, I don't know, for probably about  a year.  I've been really obsessed with this cat.  Have you?  Okay.  And you know he's all about bucking the system?  Well, you know something?  Every time you hear one of his songs, it is totally about somehow bucking the system and  going against the grain of society.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And I believe from all the articles I've read and stuff, he really doesn't like hypocrites.  No. 
[01:01:00]  No.  And I've read a lot of stuff that this kind of mindset that he has has gotten him in trouble  a few times.  Yeah.  Because he doesn't pay attention to the rules.  He's a rule breaker.  He's not a conformist.  I don't think he likes things like the way the big business runs.  He doesn't really like being sued.  He doesn't really enjoy that.  No.  Absolutely not.  You know, for his creativity.  Right.  And the way he expresses himself.  The way he expresses himself. 
[01:01:30]  Right.  But he's all about bucking the system.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Just in case the judge is listening today, wouldn't that be awful if it got down to having to  go to court?  No.  On something like that?  No.  It would seem a little hypocritical.  Yeah.  I think.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I really like his new stuff, man.  I think it's going to rock.  I'm hoping to be in one of his songs someday.  Two punk-ass guys, Opie. 
[01:02:00]  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe we can be a couple of bitches that he, you know, has a problem with in some way,  shape, or form.  I think that's a good way to show us.  Well, he can do whatever you want.  To us in song.  We'd enjoy that.  Yeah.  Anyway, it's not about us.  Andrew, I'm going so far as to say I enjoy the little candy-coated chocolate candies that  have a little peanut and just the chocolate ones. 
[01:02:30]  He has nothing to do with that.  What?  No.  Well, I'm just saying I like those, too, just in case.  I'm hedging all my bets.  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Andrew, what else you got for us?  Yeah.  Little gifts.  I brought out one of my displays that I'm going to be showing at the tattoo show.  I brought in the double-bodied pit bull.  Oh, very cool.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to see this.  Can we get pictures of this for our website?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hey, where's Steve when we need him?  Oh, foundrymusic.com.  This will be up on there.  He's a little leaky. 
[01:03:00]  I just put fresh fluid in him.  You did?  Yes.  So, was it cloudy?  It's a little jippy.  Yeah, well, I won't be handling it.  Look how cute.  Now, that's one head.  That's one head.  Whoa, and then, yeah, the hind section.  How old is this?  I don't know.  I got it from an old carny.  So, it could be, I mean, I just really couldn't tell you.  Wow.  Look at your cute puppy face.  And you're going to be showing this at Roseland.  Yeah, dog.  This will be on display on Sunday.  Sunday.  Can I see that, Jim? 
[01:03:30]  You didn't get any story behind that?  Did it live for a little while?  I have no idea.  Now, when you drain the fluid out of this, man, do you actually touch the little fella  and put more fluid back in?  Yeah, I was just touching him right before I came over.  Is he soft or?  He's hard.  Is he?  Yeah.  What this is, is he's in grain alcohol.  Oh, grain alcohol.  Yeah.  Why?  Is that better?  Well, some of the carnies couldn't get their hands on formaldehyde, so they would just  use grain alcohol.  And it's the same thing, basically.  I mean, not the same thing, but it has to be.  And you can do some shots of it. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, yeah.  Go blind.  Wow.  That is sick.  And Steve is taking video for foundrymusic.com.  Yeah.  Can I see that?  Sure.  Pass it around the room there.  Ben, if you will.  And then at some point, we'll put it right in front of the awesome cam.  Oh, yeah.  And put it still.  So you can go to that.  Look at his little mouth.  Wait a minute.  He's got a little leash on.  What, is he going to run away on all those legs?  That is humble.  That is wild.  Yeah.  He's got another, like, body growing out of the side and rear of him. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  You better carry two scoopers when you walk them.  All right.  Isn't it a...  There you go.  We'll put it in front of the awesome cam in a second.  Isn't it a shame that they don't live to actually grow up?  We'll have to walk in that down the street.  Really?  I love show and tell with Andrew Gore.  Look at that in front of the awesome cam.  Two delicious pink lipsticks to enjoy.  Isn't that beautiful?  Make sure there's a lot of light so we get a nice shot of that.  And focus it up, Steve, if you can focus the awesome cam. 
[01:05:00]  And we'll get a nice snapshot and we'll move on with what else Andrew Gore has from SatanSideshow.com.  Yeah.  And then focus it a little bit.  I'll turn it so you can look.  There you go.  Take a look.  You've got good peepers, don't you?  Yes, I do.  You can see across the...  Aw, aw, look at the little baby.  Let me see.  You got a good shot of it?  Oh, my God.  Watch the old jar thing in front of the little dog face. 
[01:05:30]  That's great.  Aw.  Are you going to get a snapshot or just let it rock for a while?  A little fella.  Turn it, turn it, turn it the other way, actually.  You get a better view of his little hind area.  Keep going.  Keep going.  That's good.  Right there.  That's cute.  Oh, man.  This is more dog to pet.  You might want to turn it a little more.  That light is kind of refracted.  All right.  What else do you got?  People like to see it.  I know. 
[01:06:00]  I just set that up.  What else you got there, Andrew?  Then I brought one of my crime collectibles.  This was sent to me by Richard Ramirez years ago, I think back in 1993.  It's an actual...  He traced his hand.  And this was...  His hands are huge.  You know what kind of mule he must have?  Oh, huge, I've heard.  You've heard.  You've heard that he has a huge mule?  I've heard.  And he drew the pentagram on it when he drew the pentagram on his palm during his trial  and held up his hand and yelled,  Hail, Satan. 
[01:06:30]  And so he drew that and just wrote all this insane stuff all around it.  Hands that slay together, stay together.  Oh, that's cute.  Show of hands for the cannibal menu.  Evil hands are happy hands.  What a nut.  Get your kicks on Route 666.  And then he even put A.D. Gore's Satan Sideshow on it.  What a pow.  Wow, look at that.  Really?  Yeah.  How twisted is that?  How do you know it's not just like a guard messing with people like you?  Well, I've talked to him.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, I've talked to him and his wife before. 
[01:07:00]  Is there any truth to what they say about mule size?  Let me say.  How do you do a finger in hand?  This guy's packing like an animal.  He should have just killed people with his mule.  That's a huge hand.  Wow.  That is a big hand.  Big murder.  You'll have that at Roseland this weekend?  Uh-huh.  All right.  What else we got there, Andrew?  And then I got one of my punk rock collectibles.  What's your name?  I toured with this band called Guar.  We know Guar.  Hell yeah.  You might do something with Guar.  Oh, you got to.  Those guys are the greatest, man. 
[01:07:30]  That is sick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They are just awesome.  And so I was on tour for them for a couple months with this other band called the Meat Man,  old punk rock band.  And we're sitting around the tour bus, and Brockie, who's odorous in the band, Lee Ching  or Guar, was like picking at his feet.  And all of his body has pretty much died like a hazy red because all the bloody, you know,  the fake blood.  Yeah, the blood that's all over.  So his toes or toenails are like red and gooey and nasty.  So he's sitting there.  He's picking at his toes.  Then one of his whole toenails came off. 
[01:08:00]  Oh, God damn.  He's got rock star toenails.  So I was sitting next to him, and everybody on the bus was like, oh, gross.  How did his toenail just fall off?  He was just picking at it.  He just yanked it.  Oh, God damn.  I can't do that.  I know.  I'm getting that feeling.  Oh, it was great.  And I was just fascinated.  It's the worst when you lose a nail.  And everybody was freaking out.  And I said, can I have that?  And then everybody went nuts.  And then I took it, and I put it in a little baggie, and I slipped it under my pillow during  the tour for good luck. 
[01:08:30]  And I'm going to frame a little show around this.  He's going to do a whole display around that.  A whole display of Odorous's actual toenail.  Hey, Anthony, we've got a brand new sponsor to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Do we?  Yeah, this segment of the Opie and Anthony Show is sponsored by Eminem.  Did you know his new album, The Eminem Show, comes out June 4th?  Yes, I did know that.  Thank you, Interscope.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Okay.  Can I see that, Andrew?  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  Dude, that is disgusting, man.  There you go.  I, I, no.  Rockstar toenail.  It's just a jar, dude.  Well, Rick, hold it.  Yeah, give it a little sniff.  All right.  A lot of people coming to me all over the country saying, you're the guy with Odorous's toenail.  So it's really legendary for something being so silly.  Wow.  Your parents must be proud.  Oh, real proud.  They, yeah, fans are kind of really, and it's all dyed red because of the upload. 
[01:09:30]  It's all the stage blood.  How about that?  And what else we got there?  And then the last thing would be, I got something for the ONA show that I don't know how I should  tell you what it is, but let me pull it out.  It's in a jar.  It's floating.  Uh-oh.  Is this a gift?  Yes, this is a gift.  Oh, no.  We're going to unwrap it here, and it is in a Mount Olive, uh, served with meats and fish. 
[01:10:00]  This is Mount Olive, and, uh, this is, this is, this is, this is the real McCoy, guys.  This is it.  Jesus Christ.  It's in just a jar.  Let me see that.  It's an olive jar.  Wow.  Let me see that.  And this is from an old traveling sideshow.  Can I see that?  Yeah.  That looks like an alien.  It certainly does.  If you notice, one of its, uh, feet are missing. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, wow.  Look at that.  That looks like Minnie John Mack.  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  Maybe this will satisfy, uh, Interscope.  My firstborn.  Yeah.  Well, uh, dude, let me see that.  Oh, look at the horrific look.  It's all twisted up like a pretzel.  Yeah, I don't know if, uh, Super GM Ken Stevens will, uh, will allow us to have this, Andrew. 
[01:11:00]  Um.  Why?  We could keep that in the office and keep it covered in a box and have all these special people view it.  Yeah, well, look at that.  Look at, uh, what Andrew has given us, Anthony.  Oh, my God.  What happened to the foot?  I have no idea.  Somebody probably said, I don't want this in me anymore.  And maybe I'll put a little piece of foot out.  What happened to the little foot?  That's the least of the little guy's problems.  Leaning against the glass like, hello, I hear something. 
[01:11:30]  He has a big, long head.  You know, with that tongue, it just would have been, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  Very nice.  Wow.  Andrew, you hang with us, right?  Yeah.  All right.  It's Andrew Gore from, uh, satansideshow.com.  He never disappoints.  He's going to be at the tattoo show at, uh, Roseland all this weekend here in New York City, Anthony.  You know what I'm just really afraid of?  Well, I'm afraid to have that just because I know us too well.  And someday it might. 
[01:12:00]  No.  It might turn into a contest.  Don't even say it.  Look at his little monkey.  I'm not saying anything.  All I'm saying is.  No.  No.  I'm going to.  I'm soldering the jar closed.  I just know someday we'll go, all right, we got an idea for a contest.  No.  We have no more ideas.  Oh, no.  See the little balloon nut?  Yeah.  Boy, that'll make you feel like a man to take that.  Oh, God.  All right.  Ah.  Well, we'll, uh, step aside, Anthony. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah?  Yep.  More?  Well, um, a few commercials.  I thought maybe we were being let go.  Well, when you put it that way, it's like, well, uh, it wouldn't be the first time, right?  We got the retarded Laverne Shirley coming in to play the movie, uh, game with us today.  Rick, you are not even right in the head.  Stop.  Did you see what he wrote?  Stop.  Stop.  That contest.  We're not doing the reverse birth contest.  It goes back from whence it came.  Stop.  Stop. 
[01:13:00]  Come on.  Stop.  All right.  We got to get Dr. Dodd in here, the masseur.  Yeah.  Who's this?  Masseur, masseuse.  Big difference.  Oh, masseur's a guy?  Yeah.  Well, okay.  Masseuse.  Yeah.  Sexy this place up a bit.  Yeah.  She's got, like, a latex, uh, nurse outfit on.  It's depressing.  She's so hot.  She's beautiful.  And Andrew Gore's going to be hanging with us for the rest of the day?  Yeah.  And, uh, the retarded Laverne Shirley, and, uh, no cheerleaders have shown up, or potential  cheerleaders.  Oh, Jesus, man. 
[01:13:30]  No.  Girls, we need cheerleaders.  We need girls to, uh, be in, uh, uh, bikinis on the baseball field when we play our softball  game on June 1st.  Right.  And all you got to do is come down here in a bikini.  That's all it takes.  And then, uh, you'll be on the field.  It's a great vantage point.  You get to see the game from right on the field.  You get to help out with, uh, some of the prize giveaways and whatnot.  And you just got to come down.  That's all.  It's easy.  Come on, ladies.  What are you waiting for? 
[01:14:00]  It's Friday.  All right.  John, what's going on?  Real fast.  We got to take a break.  What's up?  Hey, John.  What's going on, man?  I cannot believe that toenail is horrible.  That thing made me cringe.  My toes are still all curled up from that.  Oh, from, uh, the dude from Guar's, uh, big toe.  Oh, my, that is horrendous.  Yeah.  Imagine just picking your feet and your toenail.  Oh, yo, that's horrible.  That is terrible.  All right.  Thank you, John.  I love you all day.  All right.  The Brundle Fly.  All right.  All right. 
[01:14:30]  Man, we got some great things for, uh,  the 55-gallon drum challenge three.  Oh, no.  Oh, my God.  Imagine that thing peeking through one of the vent holes.  Hello.  Hello.  This segment of the Opie and Anthony show,  sponsored by Eminem.  Pick up the new Eminem CD,  the Eminem show.  It drops June 4th.  It drops.  Wow.  Using the lingo and everything.  Yo, B.  Thank you, Interscope.  Yeah.  There will always be retarded idiots 
[01:15:00]  to entertain us with this stupidity.  Mindless.  Opie.  Crotch-grabbing Anthony.  Mindless.  Opie.  Crotch-grabbing Anthony.  People grabbing the crotch and saying,  suck it, the Opie and Anthony show.  Suck it.  Law of the show.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Mindless.  Nasty.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  We should say hi to Dr. Dot.  We should get the hotness in here  before the retarded Laverne Shirley 
[01:15:30]  stop in for a visit.  She's walking around out there  in one of those nurse uniforms.  Now, I must say,  you look lovely in that get-up.  I only wear some promotional things.  I would never massage in it  unless you guys want to back.  I've never been into the nurse thing, though.  You look beautiful in it,  but it doesn't do anything extra special  because I consider the nurse uniform thing  sort of a motherly type.  No, no.  Let me tell you the problem 
[01:16:00]  with her nurse outfit.  Oh.  Problem?  Yeah, it looks like she's from like,  I mean, she's beautiful,  but the outfit looks like,  well, the hat looks like  it's from like 1950.  Yeah, it's got the old style...  Yeah, that makes me not...  Well, I only wear a hat's not modern.  What are you talking about?  But if you're going for the nurse fantasy,  Mr. Norton...  You don't want the English patient nurse hat on.  Like you're in the hospital,  you've got a broken arm,  and the nurse comes in all hot like she is,  and then she gives you a good time.  You know, you want it to look realistic. 
[01:16:30]  Now, you know what else, too?  She looks like she's ready for, you know,  a Halloween party.  And she didn't go to medical school.  That kills the fantasy.  What are you talking about?  I wouldn't care if she had a bedpan on her head.  She's gorgeous.  A dick.  There are people that are into hot women,  and then there are people that are into hot women  that have a fantasy thing going on.  I'm talking about the fantasy aspect,  the nurse outfit.  It looks wonderful.  She doesn't look like a real nurse,  is what I'm saying.  Well, what about the picture in the new FHM?  Does that look real?  You're in the new FHM, too?  Yes, I am.  Page 24, page 25. 
[01:17:00]  Let's take a look, see.  You can have a look and decide.  Even though the interview,  I was misquoted a million times.  Were you?  Wow, look at that.  What a surprise.  A journalist misquoting you?  They souped it up.  He must have been thinking that  when I was massaging him,  because he was a 22-year-old reporter  who came to my head.  Really?  Yeah.  I insist when someone writes about me  that they get a massage.  Why write about my massage  if you can't experience it, you know?  I knew some guy that knew you  said you were the hottest thing,  and I could see it now on the thing.  You know Buddy Hinton?  No. 
[01:17:30]  No?  I just moved back to America.  Yeah, no, he said, like,  you were the hottest thing.  Oh, that's sweet.  You beat me to it by one second,  you bastard.  The picture in the magazine  looks good.  Looks damn good.  But I'm not into the nurse thing.  You know what?  And a lot of guys are.  Believe me.  I live in here in a nice flowery dress.  Yes.  With ample cleavage,  but they said put the costume on,  so here I am.  Who said that?  Did Rick say that?  I think it was him.  You know something?  I got it for an FHM.  Good old Rick.  I want to see that.  I know, but you know something? 
[01:18:00]  Do we know what the nurse thing  reminds me of?  It's like that you're going to  be in some kind of pain.  Like I'm going to  look in your ass.  Or like an enema is coming, right?  I'm not a proctologist.  No, I know, but  I think sponge bath.  Sponge bath, but still,  it makes me think I'm hurt  for some reason.  I'm hurt.  Look, my nickname is Dr. Dot.  Okay, my real name is Dot,  and Frank Zavik gave me  the nickname Dr. Dot.  He did.  Why did he do that?  Hey, Dr. Dot's coming over.  Hey, it's Dr. Dot.  No, he was like, 
[01:18:30]  where's the Dr. Dot, damn it?  Where's the Dr. Dot?  About Dr. Dot.  Coming over the house.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.  Hey, Dr. Dot's paying me a visit.  He sounds just like him.  I know, so be quiet.  Let him go.  Now we're playing with Dr. Dot.  Well.  I was healing the band  with my strong hands.  Yeah, with your strong hands.  And so, when I wrote a book in Germany,  it's going to come out here soon,  and on the cover,  I'm wearing this nurse's costume,  you know, doctor, nurse, whatever.  Yeah.  It's just a publicity outfit.  Okay.  I don't walk around the street  dressed in latex. 
[01:19:00]  Well, would you like to change it  to something else for you?  Ooh, you got something else?  I have a blue flowery dress  I can put on after,  but I thought you guys  wanted a little back massage.  Well, we want to know what you do,  who you've done it with.  Now, you massage people.  I massage my heroes.  Yeah, I started when I was 14  trying to get into concerts for free.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  So you're 14 years old,  and now you go to a concert,  and you want to get backstage.  Look, me and my girlfriends  don't have tickets.  This was in Virginia Beach,  but I give the best massage in the world  I learned from my family  when I was younger.  Who was the first?  Def Leppard.  Def Leppard, and you're 14. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  Def Leppard's playing.  I made myself look older  so we could get in for free  because it was sold out.  And they were like,  geez, she is small,  but she's strong as hell.  And through word of mouth,  I've got my hands on the stones.  And Eminem, by the way,  his music, I love him.  Oh, yes.  His whole gang got a massage.  Yes.  And he could get a massage  any time he wanted.  That's right.  From Ken Stevens.  I never even liked hip-hop  until I met Eminem.  Now I love him.  Really?  Did you only do Def Leppard, though,  because Rick Allen  would be a little faster?  No, then he had his arm.  Oh, my God, you're horrible.  He still had his arm. 
[01:20:00]  Were you there during the accident  doing triage in your nurse uniform?  Choppers.  No, but my girlfriend wanted him  to go into the concert so badly.  Really?  My favorite music is Zappa  and Hendrix and the Beatles.  Gotta love Zappa, man.  How much is a massage?  How much do you charge a massage?  Well, I have a sliding rate  for the normal person.  It would be like a dollar a minute.  And somebody like Sting  or...  I'm thinking her tongue  might be too big.  I don't know.  Dire Space or whatever.  I charge them $200 an hour.  Wow.  Wow.  And Kiss, by the way.  Kiss, you know. 
[01:20:30]  Well, it's only fair, right?  Why should I charge  the Stones bus driver  the same price I charge?  I bet.  Right.  Exactly.  That's what I'm thinking.  Baton Rouge.  Baton Rouge.  Everybody should be able  to afford to have a massage.  Yeah.  But I'm also like  the Dr. Ruth of Germany.  I just moved home from Germany.  I do love sex relationship advice.  And anyone who's listening  who has a problem,  send me an email  and I'll answer it personally.  You're a little better  than Dr. Ruth, though.  Well, I can give answers  to any questions.  Because she doesn't answer  sex questions anymore,  that old bitty.  No, when she talks  about penises,  it's like, oh, no.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Let me tell you something.  I don't want you 
[01:21:00]  talking about the inner  or nothing like that.  Don't talk to me  because I am a professional.  And then you ask her,  all right, Dr. Ruth,  if a guy wants to have  some backdoor action  with his chick,  don't be ridiculous.  I'm not going to talk about...  Hey, hey, hey,  hey, Mini Fuhrer,  why the hell  don't you answer  sex questions?  Suck me.  Suck it, Tash, Anthony.  That's a great impression.  Right, exactly.  That's a great impression  of Dr. Ruth.  Well, her website's great. 
[01:21:30]  I look at her all the time.  So I tell her,  exit, stage left even,  and make her leave.  But you now,  you'll answer these questions.  Oh, yeah.  And it's mostly  relationship questions,  people.  Really?  And I just wrote a book  that's going to come out  also called  Only for Guys  and the other one's  Only for Chicks  and it's answering  all these questions.  Yeah?  In a very blunt manner.  What if somebody has like,  you ever hear of people  that have imaginary boyfriends?  I knew this chick.  Girls, you mean?  Yeah, this chick had this guy.  His name was George Glass.  But then he didn't exist.  You ever hear about  sick stuff like that?  Well, I know that girls  would do that out in public 
[01:22:00]  to make it sound like  they're taking every girlfriend.  Hold on.  We can't use the M word for that.  Yeah, you know what?  And I...  I'm about to say wanking?  Yeah, wanking.  Okay, men are wanking every day  to their imaginary girlfriend,  so what's the damn difference?  Wait, let me...  True.  Voss, is the website  a way to contact you?  It's dr.dot.com.  Dr. Dot.  Dot com.  There's no S's  on that website?  No.  Is it D-O-C or D-R?  D-R-D-O-T.  D-R-D-O-T dot com.  Oh, I thought it said dots. 
[01:22:30]  No, I have a horrible list.  What?  You know.  No, you don't.  You can do.  I know you guys...  I thought it was your accent.  What?  No, I say S's.  My S's are really messed up.  What happened there?  Wait a minute.  I can't see...  I can't help it.  My tongue's too long  or something.  Let me say.  Let me say.  I haven't...  Yes.  You made me say  suffering succotash.  Oh, you guys are much friendlier.  I feel much more...  Of course we are.  We wouldn't do anything.  We're the nice show.  We're very nice show.  That's right.  Exactly.  You guys are funny.  I mean, if you look at my guest book 
[01:23:00]  on my website,  everybody writes about you  in my guest book  and everyone's like,  oh, open, O and A are better.  They rule and all this stuff.  And I was like,  who are they?  I just came...  We rule.  All right.  Enough of that  because they just like  dumping out of that.  I know.  They're horrible with that.  But now you give advice  and massages.  Who are some of the biggest stars  that you have given  these massages to?  I'd say Sheryl Crow,  Blondie,  Lauren Hill,  Eminem,  Bruce Willis,  Kids,  Frank Zappa, 
[01:23:30]  Bush,  The Who,  Dire Straits,  Courtney Love,  Iron Maiden.  Is anything else expected of you?  Oh, yeah.  Men ask all the time.  You know,  they all get a stiffy  and I say,  well, look,  you know,  that's not my job  but I'll leave the room  and you can take care of it.  Or I make jokes about it.  I don't call the cops  or freak out  because even women get erect.  You know,  their breasts get erect.  It's just a natural...  Do they...  Not on me,  they don't.  ...response to the massage.  But do they ask you  maybe, you know,  hey, I'll give you some cash  if you take care of it. 
[01:24:00]  But you don't do that.  And the rock and roll world  is very small.  They would all gossip about it.  Right.  If I only had two loves  and I've been backstage  for 20 years,  yes, how old I am?  I'm 33.  I'm actually going to be 34  very quickly.  Hold on,  I've got to be honest with you.  I'm thinking a hot lady  like yourself  backstage at a concert  that these guys  are expecting a little more  than a cute little,  you know,  shoulder massage.  I don't exactly dress hot  when I go backstage.  Really?  Dr. Dot t-shirt and jeans.  If you have a look  at all the photos,  I'm not wearing  anything gorgeous.  They don't have hot chicks 
[01:24:30]  like you backstage  for a conversation.  Well, I don't dress hot  when I'm backstage.  And how did not be hot?  I put my hair back  in a ponytail  and I sweat to death.  But we can still  tell that you're hot.  Well,  I'm not going to make myself  ugly to prove the point  that I give the best  massage in the world.  Why should I do that?  And she's got this technique,  the biting massage.  Now, what the hell is that?  Okay, I invented a technique  long ago with my hippie parents  who taught me how to massage.  Oh, you invented a technique?  Yes, I've invented  several techniques.  One's called the bite method massage.  Yeah.  In which, before I put oil  on the back,  I bite up and down 
[01:25:00]  the whole back  except for the spine.  You bite down so hard.  I tenderize your meat  on your back.  Tenderize with your teeth.  With my teeth  because the teeth  are much stronger than the hands.  I had a hooker  massage my mule like that.  Yeah.  Of course,  everybody makes little jokes  but instead of me cowering  and making myself ugly  to prove the point,  why should I hide my sexuality?  I did when I was  following the Grateful Dead  for three years.  I made myself ugly.  Oh, hey!  That's horrible.  No bra.  No bra.  Hey, you know what?  There you go.  No bra.  I'm not hiding my sexuality 
[01:25:30]  for anybody.  Hey, right.  You want to bite a back  that has the texture  of a marshmallow?  You know,  if you're in this job,  you really can't be  thinking about smell  or texture.  No, I don't mind.  I'm not afraid  of any smell  or anything.  Jim isn't weird  when it comes to that.  No, we had a girl  so you don't want her  biting your back?  No.  Why not?  I have my lipstick on anyways.  I can give you guys  a rub with my hands  but I'm not going  to take my lipstick  off and bite you.  If I was doing  a full massage,  I would and stuff like that  but the biting is like,  mmm, it's just not.  No, you have to lay down  and have to relax.  You know,  I have very strong hands too  so I can show you 
[01:26:00]  what a shoulder rub would be like.  Why don't you give Jim a little?  Could you do it not too hard though?  I'm a girly man.  He hates hard massages.  She is really strong.  No, it's got a shoulder.  I can't.  I can feel how hard  I'm supposed to do.  Is it hurting you, Jimmy?  It's hurting, right?  He's hurting.  You're such a little pussy boy.  You're such a little faggot.  A girl is massaging you  and you're crying.  Look at his neck.  He's all,  I wish I could go into my cell.  Huh?  What?  Ow!  Ow!  Dude, she is really strong, man. 
[01:26:30]  Ow.  Ow.  She has really got great hands.  Ouch!  It's hurting me.  It's hurting?  Can I have a taste of that?  Dice would love her.  Please.  Don't let Dice  likes the rough massage.  He likes it so hard.  She likes your elbow  as hard as you can put it.  There's no point in hiring me  if you just want to be pet  because that's why they pay me  because I have hands of steel.  Ah, hands of steel.  That has nothing to do with that.  Go get Rick.  Rick's got like big shoulders. 
[01:27:00]  Ow!  What's the matter, faggot?  You really made me...  That's so fun when they're behind you.  My arm is numb.  Because you can't see her.  I think she gave me a stroke.  It's not like you can see  how hot she is  when she's standing behind you.  All you feel is these Nazi hands  digging into you.  Look at Rick!  Look!  Look at him!  You will tell us?  Look at Rick's face!  He doesn't like it?  Do you like it, Rick?  What's the matter?  You don't like it?  It's good in a painful sort of way.  Yeah?  Yeah, alright.  You guys are also... 
[01:27:30]  You won't even relax.  We're little faggots.  Hey, do you also do  dentistry, Lawrence Olivier?  I did say.  I do a flexion massage.  Yeah?  Wow.  That biting thing must really hurt.  Jesus!  How hard do you bite?  That's what's going to really be painful.  Oh, it's harder than my hands.  You biting?  But that doesn't start...  Do you bite the neck or do you do that?  I wouldn't be a massage fan  to enjoy all the techniques.  I wouldn't just start biting someone  without asking.  And in America,  I'm going to make everyone sign a waiver  because I know everyone's so sue-happy  because I've been living in Germany for years.  Yes, they are. 
[01:28:00]  Massages, playing music.  There's all kinds of things  people sue about.  I have an assistant, by the way,  so send me your photo and resume  and maybe I'll hire you  and help me rub down...  There you go.  So far, no one has liked your massage.  It's just...  Well, Rick, what do you feel?  You're much...  You're more...  Dude, wasn't the last thing she did?  Like, she really laid into your shoulder?  Reaches in and pulls it...  No, I like this.  Pulls it off the bone.  I'm liking this.  It's as much a massage as...  You ever see Indiana Jones  in the Temple of Doom  and the guy was massaging Indy's chest 
[01:28:30]  to pull his heart out?  That's what it felt like.  It was a little tough.  I like this.  You probably haven't had a massage  in a long time.  This massage reminds me  of the massage they gave  the yak at the end  of Apocalypse Now.  She's good.  She's real good.  You're not hitting him as hard.  No.  No, I get massages, though, Ant.  You do?  Yes, I do.  For me to get in there,  you're like tight loose.  Yeah.  And he wouldn't even let it know.  He would just...  I'm good, right?  I'm a little faggot.  Take the pain!  Take the pain!  Take the pain!  That's not bad at all.  What?  You have a little bit of tension here.  Oh, yeah.  Right there.  Bag this piece of ass! 
[01:29:00]  Right there.  Oh, yeah.  Right there?  Oh, yeah.  Isn't she strong?  She's very...  Your hands are so strong.  Have you ever done anything  to prove how strong you are?  Crushed hands?  The WWF wrestlers,  when I walked in to massage them backstage,  they all started laughing at me,  like,  that little thing's going to massage them.  I said,  I'm going to kick your ass.  Yes.  You've got strong hands there.  By the end of the night,  they're all like,  ooh, boo-hoo.  Really?  Yeah.  And you don't do happy endings, right?  No.  Imagine she'd yank it off.  When I'm dating a guy,  he gets an erotic massage, 
[01:29:30]  but other than that, no.  What an erotic massage?  Oh, oh, oh.  Are you a little more gentle with the handy?  No.  Or you're just still just like,  ow, ow!  Like I said,  I have hands with steel, okay?  Yeah, you certainly do.  I can understand how,  if maybe laying down,  and you're doing that,  and you're really psyched for it,  and ready for it,  that would probably be very good.  Really awesome.  But when you're just like,  behind,  you're kind of grabbing.  Come back over there.  No, no, I...  No, no, no, no. 
[01:30:00]  No, I'm running and hiding.  I'm running and hiding.  She's really good.  Why was I a faggot  looking at the corner of my shell  a second ago?  Really.  You, well,  then you do it, faggot.  No, I know I'm a faggot.  No, take another one,  gay man.  I was giggling and...  Give it to Rick.  Rick's big muscle guy.  Yeah, you're the workout freak.  Get Ben.  Oh, big.  Ben.  Ben needs one.  Ben needs one.  No, I...  He is so tish.  Oh, come on, Ben.  She is to massage  is what Kreskin is to a handshake.  He just said that  that's not bad.  What?  It's not bad at all.  She's really good.  She's saving up 
[01:30:30]  for the big money shot ending.  No, she's really good.  It hurts.  Massage, but it hurts  if you don't like...  I like gentle.  There you go.  See?  No, you got to...  And my shoes came off.  And he's got so much dope  in them for him to be in pain.  You got to relax.  You got to relax and enjoy it.  I can't relax  when I'm being tortured.  Massage is a huge mule.  Are you reading here  that someone says  this chick's...  Well, get back on mic there,  hot chick.  Hot Dr. Dot chick thing.  I love Dr. Dot.  Get on your own mic there,  Dr. Dot. 
[01:31:00]  There you go.  Yeah, let's just talk.  Yeah, there's a guy saying  that you make up  all your stories.  Well, you got to go over there.  Dr. Dot,  this would work great  if it was TV.  I see.  I see Frank Zappa.  Okay, yes.  We see your portfolio  with all of the rock stars.  Hey, you're hurting me.  Well, you know,  they're just really...  They're just people.  But see, I'm such a music fan  that I've wanted to get  in free to concerts  when I was younger.  Well, that is the way to do it.  And I wouldn't want to do  the favors that the other girls  would go to.  Who is that?  Who is that on that page?  That's NSYNC.  Oh, you...  Just because I massage someone 
[01:31:30]  doesn't mean I'm a fan of the music.  Is that you?  Who is that in the corner?  That's my daughter.  Oh, oh, my God.  How old is she?  13.  And how old are you?  Let me do some math.  Going to be 34 in October.  21.  No, I'm going to be 34 in October.  You can't have been  hanging out with Frank Zappa  in 88 and B20.  Right.  You know?  Is that a rock star  father for that?  No, he's a boring little German.  Really?  I don't date.  The only stars I've ever dated  was Joey Ramone.  None of these guys...  Joey Ramone was my first boyfriend  and my first big love.  And after I saw how all the girls  wanted to meet him every night, 
[01:32:00]  I decided I don't want to have  a star as a boyfriend  because I'm not into  all that competition.  I don't like it.  How'd you like a failed comic?  What?  I like normal guys.  I don't want somebody famous.  None of these guys  are asking for more.  I mean, I see pictures  with Kiss there.  I mean, we all know  Gene Simmons is a pig.  Yeah, I said...  Did you massage Gene Simmons?  I massage Kiss every time.  Yeah.  I gave him his first massage  he ever had.  I gave him his first...  He had a foot massage.  And I said to Doc,  Doc McGee...  Gene's big sweaty feet.  No, he's nice and clean.  They're clean.  Really?  Yeah, they're very clean.  And I said to Doc,  if Gene wants anything  more than a massage, 
[01:32:30]  I'm leaving the room.  I'm charging you anyway.  He's like, no, he really does.  And he was trying  You would leave  even if a guy  wanted to just  finish himself off  without your help?  I'm not going to watch,  but, you know...  Would you sit there  and just yell at him?  No.  No, because there's enough...  They have enough girls  like that.  You know, I bring them out  after.  I bring them to concerts.  I mean, not concerts.  I bring them to clubs,  restaurants, and everything.  And if they want to know  where the naughty girls are, 
[01:33:00]  I'll show them  where they can find them.  Oh, McCartney!  But I only got to hang out  and meet him.  I didn't get to massage him yet.  His girlfriend was  giving us the evil eye.  I bet.  And there's Sting,  who was one of my favorite clients.  Yeah, how do the chicks  feel about that?  Like, they must get pissed off  that you're coming around.  Well, I usually massaged  the girlfriends, too,  but she was very angry  all the time.  Another short time.  You want to do her  and the drummer  from Def Leppard?  You'll be done  in five minutes.  No.  When I massaged  Def Leppard,  he still had his...  His arm, right.  They're simply red 
[01:33:30]  and blondie  and typo-negative.  If you're really  in a hurry,  do Mabel King real quick.  I'm really...  All right.  So you've got this book  coming out, huh?  I see.  Yeah.  Well, I'll come back  when it comes out.  It's called  Butt Naked and Backstage,  but I'm here today  to talk about...  So you're going to be  dishing some stories?  But there's no  offensive things in there.  I mean, 20 years of backstage  is going to be  some drugs and sex.  You know,  you can't talk about  20 years backstage  without a little bit of that.  If it's a whole book  about massages,  then you're not going to sell too many.  No, it's all the things  that's happened  on the Dead Tour  with Frank Zappa  and everything.  It's really great. 
[01:34:00]  You know,  if you're a real rock fan,  you'll love the book  because it would be like,  it's better than  a reporter's perspective,  you know?  I've showed all the stars  their chapter  and they were happy with it.  A word.  Did I say it wrong?  No.  It was a good effort.  The slip is amazing.  I put a slip on  because this dress,  I brought it to my tailor  to get made a little bit shorter  and she went out of control  so now I have to wear a slip  otherwise...  Because it's a little too short?  Why not just the slip?  Oh, because in the front  I think men like to have fantasy.  If you show too much  then it's boring.  There's too much breath  on TV here.  I can't believe 
[01:34:30]  every channel is a breath,  breath, breath.  I think it's cute  to do innuendos and stuff  but I think all out  showing everything is bad.  I'd take some clothes  on all my women.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, me too.  I think it's just too vulgar,  you know?  I mean,  this is the only nude photo  ever of me  but I did it with body painting.  You had body painting.  And there's Leonard Skinner  who, by the way,  were really funny.  Aerosmith.  Now look,  you and Stephen Tyler.  Stephen Tyler is really cool.  Did he enjoy...  Oh yeah,  he even got the forehanded  massage on his birthday.  So when I have an assistant  I let them do the feet  and the legs  while I do the back.  Yeah, so they get 
[01:35:00]  double treatment.  Wow.  Double treatment.  All right.  And there's Ellis Cooper.  He's really funny.  Dr. Dot.  Well, okay,  Sunday is Joy Ramones' birthday.  Yeah.  And at CBGB's  there's a thing called  the Bowery Electric Party  and they made a song  into tribute  for the rest of the Ramones.  Okay, Joey,  Tommy,  Johnny.  You could just say  the rest of the Ramones.  Johnny, okay,  the leftover Ramones.  Right.  Have made a song  in tribute for Joey.  Oh boy.  It just came out  called the Bowery Electric.  Yeah.  And they're making a party  at CBGB's  and I'm going to be there 
[01:35:30]  moderating the show  because there's 11 bands.  So when is that?  Chris Stein,  and Blondie,  and Marky Ramones,  they're all going to be  in the judges,  you know.  Sure, sure.  Judging.  All that stuff.  That's why I came here today  to talk about Joey.  All right.  Bravo.  Well, Dr. Dot,  your pictures are amazing.  Thank you.  Can you say my website  one more time?  Of course.  Go ahead.  www.drdot.com.  D-R-D-O-T dot com.  Right.  If anyone needs love advice,  just give me a shout.  All right.  Thank you so much  for dropping in  in your lovely nurse uniform.  And kicking your ass. 
[01:36:00]  And kicking our ass.  Wonderful.  Okay.  All right.  I have a love question.  Okay, go ahead.  When I donkey punch a girl,  why does she get mad?  Donkey punch.  Good question.  That's rude.  That is very rude.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  All right.  You should be busy  giving pleasure,  not pain.  All right.  Well, Dr. Dot,  thank you so much.  Dr. Dot,  I want to leave  a sexy photo for you guys.  Yes, you leave that.  Well, that looks like  a picture that Tom took  from New Orleans.  You know what?  This is too good  to pass up.  Get Marion in here.  Oh, my goodness. 
[01:36:30]  Marion and Dr. Dot,  I just want to hear  them talk a little bit.  Marion, look at Dr. Dot,  Marion.  Look at the difference  in appearance.  Why?  Isn't she great?  Say hi to Dr. Dot.  Say hi.  Dr. Dot.  Dr. Dot.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Do you have any problems  sexually?  No, love or relationship  problems.  I have no sexual problems  with them.  No.  Why, do you?  No.  I'm just that,  because she's an expert.  Oh, well, nice.  I have no problems at all.  Any questions you want  to ask her?  No.  I don't need to.  Why?  No, talk to Dr. Dot.  Well, they just went through.  For what?  I don't need to ask you 
[01:37:00]  any questions.  She's a masseuse.  Oh, she's a masseuse.  Do you want a shoulder massage?  You want a massage?  No.  Get a little massage  and let us know  how it feels.  Ask Diane.  No, she just does it nice.  Listen, massage her  rhino's shoulders.  Let me tell you  something about rhino's shoulders.  This rhino's shoulders  I've been working out.  So what have you been doing?  Oh, that's really nice.  No, come on.  Yeah.  It hurt?  Did that hurt?  A little.  She's really tense.  Yeah.  She's tense, yeah.  A little other lighter.  Why?  Do you feel some hardness? 
[01:37:30]  I'm always tense.  Why?  It's called the exoskeleton.  Yeah, try Diane.  Oh, really?  No, I want you two  to talk a little bit.  I've never actually seen  a perm and a mullet.  How did you pull that off?  Hey, keep my hair along.  It's a perm and a mullet.  Very good.  A mullet.  That's a mullet.  A merm.  Wait, I want to hear  these two talk for a second.  Just for a merm.  Let me tell you.  My hair looks good.  You don't like it, don't look.  I ain't here to impress you.  Do you like her hair? 
[01:38:00]  It's a nice color,  but it would be too curly  for my taste.  I couldn't deal with it.  Hey, Dr. Dodd,  you've got something  going on up there,  I noticed,  through your little...  Whoa, hey.  Wow.  What have I got going on?  Who thought you couldn't  kind of see that through there?  It made me excited.  I can't help it.  Yes.  Wow.  What do you think?  I can dial a phone  with these babies.  I see that.  Mary, what do you think?  She's got something...  Why?  Yeah?  It's good.  Does she?  I don't know how to make friction.  I don't know.  What's going on?  No, we just...  I don't always make friction  to these guys.  You don't know  these guys like guys do.  Hers are about 14 inches 
[01:38:30]  higher on the torso  than yours.  I mean, that is so mean.  I might be big busted,  but I'm happy.  Yeah?  I have no problem.  The bigger the cushion,  the better the cushion.  I have no problem.  That's true.  Who wants to ride  on an ironing board?  No.  No, you, him.  A little cushion is nice,  but, you know,  it's not about cushion  to leap out of a burning building.  I have no problem at all.  The fire department  should just bring you around  and save people.  I'd rather have these  than have nothing at all.  I'd rather have these  than have fake.  That's true.  And be silicone.  They look very good for cushion. 
[01:39:00]  They look very nice.  They're ugly.  What?  Those are good if you...  Silicone.  What?  What?  Could someone give me a towel?  I know.  What are you doing?  Well, I just got here.  Do you know why you're here today?  Maybe a DJ, too?  I'm from the subway.  You know, the subway.  Say it.  Don't play it.  She is a DJ.  What is that tie  in the middle of that shirt?  I don't get it.  It's the way the shirt came.  Why?  It just makes you look...  It's the style.  It's awful.  Is she a DJ, too?  That's the style.  Yeah, she's a DJ, all right?  I like it.  She's got to create a...  But, you know, Jim, 
[01:39:30]  at least I wear nice clothes  and at least I change my clothes.  At least I come up here  and buy clothes.  You don't wear nice clothes.  You have the same clothes on.  You're wearing a red circus tent.  That's not my clothing.  She got you, Jimmy.  Hey, Gene.  Hey, Dr. Dot,  what do you think of Mary?  She was like something  you want shopping.  I think that she's not  taking any crap from anyone.  Right.  She don't take guff.  I heard it's not that good.  She sounds like a New Yorker girl to me.  Oh.  Very good.  Like you're not taking any crap.  I don't.  She's really zinging me.  I don't.  I'm from Newark, so.  Oh.  You're not taking any crap  except that genetic mess 
[01:40:00]  that God gave you.  It's called...  I don't take crap from nobody.  You should be running  to a subway station  while British children chase you.  Hey, I heard about your apartment.  I am not an animal.  I am half of Laverne and Charlie.  Anthony Hopkins should rescue you.  I heard about your apartment.  Shut up, you monster.  I heard you don't have  that great of an apartment here.  You're not.  I heard your apartment's sick.  You were in line with Diane last night,  so she told me.  I really was.  You flabby-armed,  mullet-headed nothing.  I don't have a mullet head.  Guys, there's some... 
[01:40:30]  Somebody wants to ask...  She has the same kind of lisp as me.  No way.  Stop it.  I don't notice yours at all.  Say suckers and suckatash.  Yeah, say...  I have crooked teeth.  What's the big deal?  What?  Say suckers and suckers.  You know something?  At least I have crooked teeth.  At least I have scruples.  At least I don't walk around  with, you know...  With what?  Don't know where to go.  Don't know what to do.  You know what I mean?  Because you know directions,  you're justifying what a mess you are?  I do so do with my life.  You know what I mean?  You read MapQuest  and you think you're hot?  What are you talking about?  No, I don't read MapQuest.  Shut up.  Well, she has a nice big mouth  and a nice big breast. 
[01:41:00]  What else do you want?  Oh.  God, I wish Voss was here  for the trifecta.  I joined a gym a few months ago.  I've lost weight.  I'm high.  I haven't lost as much  as I need to,  but at least I...  No, one thing.  I go to the gym  when I can.  Yeah.  God bless you for that.  Yeah.  Okay.  Any more questions?  That's great.  I love Doc and Doc.  I love Doc and Doc.  That's so sweet.  Any more questions?  I was wondering,  can we make photos?  I want to make a photo  for my website.  Yeah, we can make a photo.  Make one. 
[01:41:30]  How do you make photos?  I've got to get my English  back in order here.  Yeah.  Oh.  Take the photo.  Make the photo.  Hey, there's some guy on the...  Anthony, there's some guy  on the phone  that wants in  on this conversation.  She wants me to take the picture.  Hold on.  Yes, sir.  Sir.  Hey, how are you guys doing?  What's up, Frenchy?  Hey, what's up?  I hear that the fat troll  is over there, huh?  Hey, Frenchy,  how you doing?  How you doing,  you stupid fat whore?  Are you a French crawler?  How you doing?  Yeah.  You should wear garbage bags  on your head,  you fat bitch that you are.  You belong in a dumpster. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, I saw you over there.  Hey.  Hey.  You put your hair in the fryer?  Hey.  You whore.  Hey.  I'm your friend  with a retarded kid  that goes around.  You fag.  She has a retarded kid.  You fag.  She was telling the kid  to look at me.  The stupid kid  was looking at me  like he looked on the floor  and he didn't know  what to say.  And I called the mother  right on front  of the stupid little bitch.  Hey, Frenchy.  He didn't know what to say,  that little stupid prick. 
[01:42:30]  He was an ass.  Oh, fuck.  What the hell?  What the hell?  What's wrong?  I should have punched him  in the head  you stupid little prick.  Hey, Frenchy, I can't even  understand what you're  talking about.  Shut your mouth  with your foolish ass.  You sound like you're,  you know, you're talking  like a dick in your mouth.  That's what you have.  Crocodile mouth.  You sound like you don't even  know what to say.  You could bite somebody's leg  off with your head  with your stupid teeth.  You're in the middle of  swallowing some white stuff.  You have crocodile mouth.  Wow, Marion, coming back. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, Marion is in the dumpster.  You do, huh?  You can't say that?  No, you're saying  Oh, okay, I'm sorry.  Do you like it in EA?  No, do you?  I heard you do,  because you have a big enough  blood force in the air.  You're stupid, bitch.  You know what you are?  I tell you right now  what you are.  You're a lesbo  and you like carpet munching.  You know what you are?  And you know what you do?  You would kill somebody  because you would munch  on somebody else  and you would eat them away.  So if I see you  as a softball thing,  you're going to,  believe me,  you're going to get it. 
[01:43:30]  I'm going to see you  as a softball.  I'm going to punch you  in the mouth so hard.  Then I'm going to put you  teeth back straight  in your mouth.  All right.  All right, Frenchy.  Hey, Frenchy,  get the feet out of your mouth.  All right, Frenchy,  we don't want to burn you out.  All right, guys.  I talk to you later.  We need you for the celebrity.  We don't want to burn you out.  Thank you.  I don't want to burn you out.  Have a bite.  Frenchy.  I'll play, guys.  Oh, you got Frenchy.  All right, listen.  We've got to take a break  because the retard of the birds  earlier here,  they're going to do  the movie game again today, Anthony.  Yes, they are.  They're going to reenact 
[01:44:00]  some famous scenes  from famous guy movies.  Yes.  And we're going to need  some help from our listeners.  They're going to have to guess  what movie  these famous scenes are from  as enacted by this  lovely pair,  the retard of the birds.  And you know what's  up for grabs today, Ant?  What?  Tickets to the celebrity  softball game.  Oh, nice.  The Opie and Anthony  celebrity softball game  sponsored by Coors Light.  Nice prize.  So we'll start the game  next, I think.  Just wants to save this website.  Oh, boy, yes.  Okay, this is for Joey. 
[01:44:30]  www.officialramones.com  Hold on, hold on.  Now I've got to dump out.  Now we're back.  Go ahead again.  Officialramones.com  Okay.  That's all I wanted to say.  Officialramones.com  Thank you, Dr. Dot.  Dr. Dot.  We look forward  to the masseuse talk.  Out of that whole exchange  that went on,  Kenny D is just amazed  that Jim Norton  knew anything about  mapquest.com.  That's what he took  away from it. 
[01:45:00]  All right.  You know what we do here?  Absolutely nothing.  That's wonderful, isn't it?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, we're back  with the Opie and Anthony show.  You asked again.  Awful, Jim.  No one even knows  what just happened, so.  Jim just got gotten  by Opie so bad.  What was the line  you used?  I didn't hear it.  During commercials,  you know, we could see  all the phone calls  coming in.  I go, oh, Jim, 
[01:45:30]  you want to take this one?  And then I just  started looking at it.  And Jim came walking  around the Opie side  and goes, where?  What?  Where?  Which one?  Where?  Oh.  Then he made the face  like Pesci when he  walked into that house  to become a made man  and got shot in the head.  I just went.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Pop.  He got me.  Got.  You really got me good.  All right, we're running  out of show fast,  believe it or not.  Yeah.  It's been a very busy day.  We got the retarded  Laverne and Shirley.  Speaking of freak shows  there, Andrew. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah, how about these two?  You got to love  these two, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Could you put them  in formaldehyde  and you'd have pickled elephants?  You can make a little display  with them, right?  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  Put them up.  All right, let's get  their song on the radio  as they make their way  into the studio.  Jim has coined  the phrase,  Paul.  Or myrrh, my life, too.  We're ugly.  We won't shut up  and we're nauseating.  We're so annoying,  no one can take it.  When we look in the mirror, 
[01:46:30]  we break it.  We'll give you nightmares  all day long.  Like a couple of weevils,  not an ounce of sex appeal.  Make a chance for us,  not possible.  A warthog and Godzilla  in leather pants.  Everybody.  Yes, we're both  retarded, retarded.  Yes, we were born that way.  Yes, we're both  retarded, retarded.  Make any men 
[01:47:00]  turn gay.  We won't go away.  Ladies and gentlemen,  it's Lady Di and Marion.  The retarded.  Hi, how you doing?  The retarded Laverne and Shirley.  How are you?  Hi, people.  How are you?  Look, she's got her  bling bling on.  Why are you dressed  like Dan Tanner?  That is horrible.  Who is Dan Tanner?  Dan Tanner?  Who doesn't remember  Dan Tanner?  That's a detective show. 
[01:47:30]  I got your t-shirt on.  Very good, Marion.  That's just that awful  flowered color shirt.  I forgot the first name.  I forgot the name of the show,  but he's a detective.  Okay, he's a detective.  It's from like the 80s,  70s, 80s.  Okay.  Yeah, whatever.  And it really bugs me  that you and Stinky  have the same hair.  That really annoys me,  coming out of the back  of the hat.  Wait a minute.  No, we don't have  the same hair.  But you got your hair cut, Diane,  but you're still wearing hats.  I can't tell you got your hair cut.  You got your hair cut?  Yeah, I got my hair cut.  Let's see, Lady Di.  But how can I tell?  Your hat's covering your head.  Lady Di, you might be 
[01:48:00]  using too much soy sauce  when you go to the  Japanese restaurant there.  Your face is a little...  Soy sauce?  Yeah, it bloats the face.  You might want to  cut back on that.  Oh, Jesus.  Okay, I will.  I'll cut back on that.  Apparently you have  soy sauce and an IV drip  at your house.  I'd like to cut your hair  with an axe that is...  You have a little...  What do they call  that haircut?  Like a...  What happens?  It's almost like a Dutch boy.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  Beer.  Kind of.  Oh, the beer is making  her bloated?  Is that what's doing  that?  Oh, Marianne is saying  that the beer is bloating 
[01:48:30]  you up there, Lady Di.  That is not true.  Too much yin-yang party?  No.  You try to tell her, right?  Now, Marianne, I can see  Marianne is a very good  friend to you, Lady Di.  You don't take her word.  She's the one that's  responsible.  She knows what's best for you  and you don't listen to her.  Because, Dianne,  I tried to tell you  that certain beers  that you drink  it shows in your face.  I tell you,  it's with...  Yeah, that chocolate  cake beer you've been  shoving into your house.  All the old dual spears  that I've been drinking.  You gorilla.  Oh.  Oh, man. 
[01:49:00]  I look okay.  My haircut looks okay.  I look okay.  She's been working out,  but I have well.  That does look okay  if you're a Mexican in 1930.  You should be working  on a railroad  with that haircut.  I've been lording again.  At least I have hair.  I know you do.  Oh, now Lady Di coming back.  No, that's not even a good one  because he chooses  not to have hair.  We've both been lacking.  Like if he was bald,  then you might be on to something,  but he just chooses  to shave his head like that.  I don't think of something  to tell him.  Because all the other fellas  shave their head like that, right?  We've both been lacking  the gym all week.  I only went once this week. 
[01:49:30]  Really?  I had a lot of appointments  I had to keep this week.  On your planet,  how long is a week  in our time?  Yeah, exactly.  Now, I see you're wearing  a Jim Norton t-shirt, though.  Yes, I am.  You can bitch  and complain about him  all you want,  but you're wearing his shirt.  And she's so fat.  It's actual size.  And you're always  online with him, too, so.  You're online with him  at least once every two weeks.  All right, listen.  I talked to him  once in a while.  All right, can we play  the movie?  How are you?  The movie game.  It was such a great success  last time we did it.  What are we doing here now? 
[01:50:00]  Shut up, lady.  As you recall...  We gave you your time.  Now you've got to listen  a little bit.  Lady Diane Marion  will be giving scripts  to famous scenes  from famous guy movies.  Right.  They will then  go back and forth  with the dialogue  from the movie  and we will go to  a lucky caller  on our screen.  Right.  And that caller  must figure out  what movie  that scene is from  based solely  on their  what is going to be  an Academy Award  winning performance  of that scene. 
[01:50:30]  You know, guys,  you know what's  at the theater tonight  at the Garden  at the Daytime Emmy Awards?  We could have done them.  Sure, why not?  We could have been  in the opening act.  All right, so Stinky  is handing out the scripts.  You know, Marlon Brando  whistles clearer than you speak.  Hey, I don't know  how to whistle that good,  do you?  All right.  Okay, we're ready to play.  Nice comeback, Mary.  Well, all right.  Now, look, look.  I already see a problem  with this.  Is this the same one  they have?  Yes.  Now, why did you print this? 
[01:51:00]  Because they're going to  read this and ruin  the whole game.  I crossed it out.  You did?  I crossed it out.  Do not read anything  that has crossed it out.  Do not mean anything  that may quomp down.  We got you, Anthony.  We won't do that.  Say what?  Repeat that.  All right, shut up.  They only read the highlight.  I totally made it easy.  Only highlight.  They only read what's highlighted.  Now, when you look at the paper,  don't mumble out.  Don't read a thing aloud.  You guys are crazy.  You know they're going  to mess it up anyway. 
[01:51:30]  I know.  I try.  Shut up.  This is for tickets  for the 2002 Opie and Anthony  Celebrity Softball Game  that drops June 1st, Anthony.  Yeah.  Three days before  Eminem's new album.  Exactly.  At Riverfront Stadium.  Sponsored by Coors Light.  We got Billy from Oceanside.  What's up, Billy?  What's up, guys?  You ready to play the movie game?  Yep.  All right, listen closely  to this scene  that will be enacted  by these two  and try to figure out  what the movie is.  Now, Marion,  you will be playing the part  that starts first. 
[01:52:00]  Don't say it.  Don't mouth it.  Don't say it.  And Lady Di,  you're playing  the second one.  Okay.  You see that?  Don't say it.  Now, start your scene  when we say  action.  And, Billy,  you know what you're doing, right?  Yeah, no problem.  Okay.  All right, let's go, ladies.  Go ahead.  All right, go.  You like Huey Lewis  and the news.  They're okay.  The early work  was a little too new way 
[01:52:30]  for my face.  Cut, cut, cut.  Marion,  Marion,  hello,  if I could ask you,  please play it up  a little more.  You're just reading it  very monotone.  Yeah, you were acting  last time.  Get your face out  of the page,  as they say.  You're acting.  You're acting.  Have a connection  with the other actor.  All right?  Let me just say,  without giving anything away,  your performance  as you read  these lines,  you should be  very analytical,  very into it.  Very into what you're saying.  Okay.  Be very into what you're saying. 
[01:53:00]  Very passionate about  what you're talking about.  You should have a little passion  for what you're talking about.  Because you're built  like Gamera,  you don't have to read  like him.  You're built like King Kong.  Oh, she understood  the movie monster, though.  She got it right.  You're a Godzilla movie, too.  Very good, Mary.  Okay, take two.  Take two,  quiet on the set,  and action.  You're like Huey Lewis  and the news.  They're okay.  Their early work  was too new way  for my taste,  but when sports came out  in 83,  I think they really  came into their own,  commercially and artistically.  The whole album 
[01:53:30]  has a clear, crisp sound  and a new sheen  of consummate professionalism  that really gives  songs a big boost.  He's been compared  to Elvis Costello,  but I think Huey  has a far more bitter,  cynical sense of humor.  Hey.  Yes, Alan.  Why are there copies  of the style section  all over the place?  You have a dog?  A little chow or something?  No, Alan.  Is that a raincoat?  Yes, it is. 
[01:54:00]  In 87,  Huey Lewis released this  for their most accomplished album.  I think their  undisputed masterpiece  is safe to be swear.  A song so catchy  most people probably  don't listen to their lyrics,  but they should  because it's not just  about the pleasure  to comfort me  and the importance  of friends,  it's also a personal statement  about the band itself.  Hey, Paul.  Ah, they're getting  your reservations at  Dorcia.  Now you effing  selfish bastard.  You effing selfish bastard. 
[01:54:30]  You girls are passionate.  There it is.  I'm glad she took  my advice  and read it  with a little more passion.  You did nothing.  You did not  emote anything  in that scene.  The emotional range  of an autistic.  That was horrible.  You should drive  the car slow  on Saturdays.  You didn't sound  into what you were saying.  You were, again,  just reading.  I disagree.  I was into it.  You disagreed?  It was awful.  Well, no,  because the whole thing 
[01:55:00]  is you doing.  All right,  she showed me.  And Billy,  from Ocean Side,  what movie  were they acting out?  Don't you stare at it,  eat it,  American Psycho.  Oh,  American Psycho!  With Marion  playing, of course,  Bateman.  American Psycho!  They don't even  know the movie.  Jesus.  Billy,  you got a pair of takes  to the 2002  Opie and Anthony  Celebrity softball game  at Riverfront Stadium  June 1st.  You could go, right?  Yeah, bro.  Hold on the line.  They're going to get  your info.  Tell the guy  who found you  attractive.  I like the way  she did. 
[01:55:30]  I would have got  a woman that could  find you attractive.  Hey, Paul,  what's a woman?  Stupid.  Hold on, hold on.  Go ahead, Ian.  Did you like the part  where she went,  hey, Paul,  ah, you're getting  your resume?  It's like, no,  it's like, hey, Paul.  And then, ah,  the guy, he's killing  him at that point.  He's screaming as he's  acting.  I don't have to get  into the acting.  All right, listen.  So, shut up.  So, we have a  reference point.  This is the scene.  You like Huey Lewis  and the News?  They're okay.  Their early work  was a little too  new wave for my taste. 
[01:56:00]  But when sports  came out in 83,  I think they really  came into their own,  commercially  and artistically.  The whole album  has a clear,  crisp sound  and a new sheen  of consummate  professionalism  that really gives  the songs  a big boost.  He's been compared  to Elvis Costello, 
[01:56:30]  but I think Huey  has a far more bitter,  cynical sense of humor.  Hey, Albert,  just trying to...  Yes, Alan?  Why are there copies  of the style section  all the place?  Do you have a dog  a little chow  or something?  No, Alan.  Is that a raincoat?  Yes, it is.  In 87,  Huey released this  for her most  accomplished album.  I think their  undisputed masterpieces  is Hip to be Square,  a song so catchy, 
[01:57:00]  most people probably  don't listen to the lyrics.  But they should  because it's not just  about the pleasures  of conformity  and the importance  of friends.  It's also a personal  statement about  the band itself.  Hey, Paul!  Ah!  Ah!  I couldn't take  the furnace man  I had to fall  into the animation  and George  get down,  you  f*****!  You'll be  fantastic!  You're not  in the  You're f*****!  You're not  in the  You're not  in the  You're not  in the 
[01:57:30]  You're not  in the  You're not  in the  It's Hip to be  Square!  Nice!  Goddamn,  what a movie.  I think the ladies  nailed that.  I think you guys  hit it on the head  now that I listen back.  You nailed it.  You did very well, man.  You hit it on the head  that one.  But the game  was being a little  too harsh.  I had forgotten  what the actual  scene sounded like  so now hearing it  you guys nailed it.  You guys were right on.  Okay.  Bravo.  Thank you.  Is that not one  of the best scenes  in any movie ever?  I can't get enough  of that movie.  You look. 
[01:58:00]  Alright, shut up.  I know why.  We've talked about  Mr. Book.  We're running out  of time though  and this game  is too priceless.  This game's too  close to my heart.  I like this game.  Alright, now again  I want to exploit it  to its fullest potential.  Keep your mouth shut.  Don't read a thing  until we tell you  and just read  what we can do.  Tom from Philly.  What up?  You want to play  the movie game?  You know it.  And now if you win  these tickets  you could come up  for it, right?  Hell yeah, dude.  I work at nowhere.  Nice.  Alright, cool.  All you have to do  is listen to these  two lovely ladies. 
[01:58:30]  We're whales.  Thank you, Opie.  Act out a scene  from a very popular movie  and if you guessed  the movie  you got the tickets, okay?  No problem.  Alright.  Are you ladies ready?  Yes, we are.  Okay, you  let's see  Lady Di  will be starting  Rick's got it figured out  I think.  I hope so  the right way.  No, we know.  Alright.  There's some emotion  in this too.  Okay.  In other words  let me know when  Marian's is the real star.  She gets all the good lines. 
[01:59:00]  Good website.  Lady Di's filler.  Go ahead.  They kicked us  out of school?  Huh, that makes sense.  Hey, what's this  lying around?  No, no, no.  God, God.  When you see  S like that  it's, you know,  the S word  it's a curse  since you can't say it.  It's not the sound  a snake makes.  No, don't say it.  I know, I know.  But you're mouthing it.  Hey, what's this  lying around?  No!  No!  Just say S.  In other words  just read. 
[01:59:30]  Right.  War's over, man.  Hold on, hold on.  Start over.  Oh my God  do you want to  reach over and choke her?  She mispronounced  the word S.  How stupid are you  to mispronounce  a letter?  I'm goofing around.  You're not goofing around.  Alright, let's start  over again.  Lady Di,  start this off.  Action.  They kicked us  out of school?  Ah, that makes sense.  Hey, what's this  lying around S?  No!  Oh my God!  Say S!  I did say S!  You genuine  pool of vomit. 
[02:00:00]  You went S.  I said S.  No, you didn't.  Start it over.  Marion, remember the last  time we told you?  Hey, what's this  lying around, S?  Yeah.  Right.  Alright, okay.  Go ahead.  Let's start over again.  Start over and action.  They kicked us  out of school?  Ha, that makes sense.  Hey, what's this  lying around, S?  War's over, man.  Wormer dropped  the big one.  What?  Over?  Did you say over?  Nothing's over  until we decided it is.  What?  Was it over when  the Germans  bombed Pearl Harbor?  Hell no! 
[02:00:30]  Germans forget it.  He's rolling.  It ain't over now,  because when the  going gets tough,  the tough gets going.  Who's with me?  Let's go.  Come on.  Ah!  Keep going.  That's all you.  What's the F  happened to the Delta?  I used to know.  Where's the spirit?  Where's the gun?  Ha.  This could be the  greatest night of our  lives, but you're  going to let it be  the worst.  Oh, we're afraid to  go with you, Bluto.  We might get in  trouble.  Well, just kiss my  A from now on. 
[02:01:00]  Not me.  I'm not going to  take this.  Warmer, he's a  dead man.  Marmalade, dead  Niedermeyer.  Dead, Bluto's  right, psychotic,  but obviously  right.  We've got to  take these  bastards.  We could fight  them with  conventional weapons,  but that could  take years and  cost millions of  lives.  No, in this case,  we have to go  all out.  I think the  situation absolutely  requires a real  futile and stupid  gesture be done on  somebody's part, and  we're just the guys 
[02:01:30]  to do it.  Let's do it.  Let's do it!  Wow!  All right.  I felt like I  was there watching  the movie again.  Tom's going to get  this because, man,  they acted that  out perfect.  Tom, if you  would please tell  us what movie  they were doing  that famous  scene from.  Well, Otter, I'm  going to have to  go with Animal  Health.  Animal Health.  Wow, was that  amazing?  Tom, hold on a  line.  We're going to  give you some  info about the  game, okay?  One of my favorites  too.  All right.  Obviously.  Pluto's right, 
[02:02:00]  psychotic.  No!  Pluto's dead,  dead.  Pluto's right,  psychotic.  All right, so we  have a reference  point.  Here it is.  It kicked us  out of school?  Huh.  That makes sense.  Hey!  What's this  lying around  this s***?  War's over, man.  Wormer dropped  the big one.  What?  Over?  Did you say  over?  Nothing is over  until we decide  it is.  Was it over  with the Germans  bomb Pearl Harbor?  Hell no!  German?  Forget it, he's  rolling. 
[02:02:30]  And it ain't over  now.  That's where  they're going,  you toughs!  Let's have  get going!  Who's with me?  Let's go!  Come on!  What the f***  happened to the  Delta?  I used to know.  Where's the  spirits?  Where's the  guts?  Huh?  This could be  the greatest  night of our  lives.  But you're  going to let  it be the  worst. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, we're  afraid to go  with you,  Pluto.  We might  get in  trouble.  Well, just  kick my  ass from  now on!  Not me!  I'm not  going to  take this!  Wormer, he's  a dead man!  Wormer,  Lord, dead!  Me, a liar!  Dead!  Pluto's  right.  Iconic, but  absolutely  right.  We've got to  take these  bastards.  Yeah.  We could  fight them  with conventional  weapons.  That could  take years  and cost  millions of  lives.  No, in  this case, I 
[02:03:30]  think we  have to go  all out.  I think  this situation  absolutely  requires a  real, futile  and stupid  gesture you've  got on  somebody's  part.  We're just  the guys  that do  it.  Let's do  it.  Bravo!  Great, great  scene that  was.  How memorable.  Animal House.  That's like  me in my  high school  days.  Oh, yeah?  That's when we  saw the movie, 
[02:04:00]  right?  In our high  school days.  Oscar from  the Bronx  checking in,  saying at  least she  looks like  Belushi.  I'm not  heavy, so...  Well, the  guy was  saying that.  You're not  heavy compared  to a  Jupiter moon,  maybe.  I'm not  heavy.  Yes, you  are.  No, I'm  not.  You are.  Yes, you  are.  How much  do you  weigh, Jim?  About 140.  All right, listen,  we're going to  play one more  before break here.  Look at you  arguing with  Take it easy,  drier-lit hair.  Hey, let me  tell you, my  hair doesn't  look bad.  I like the  way it looks.  All right, one 
[02:04:30]  more now.  Marion, I like  your hair.  I know cancer  patients that  would rather have  their hair.  Do you have  cancer patients?  Do you have  cancer?  You almost  said, do you  have cancer  patients?  You really  are.  I like  what you're  going.  He does  not.  Cancer patients  are bald.  What's a  cancer patient,  Mary?  They're bald.  Cancer patients  are bald.  I'm enjoying  your new look.  I like it.  I don't press  people.  No jokes.  There's nothing  wrong with a  perm being  bobby pinned 
[02:05:00]  back in the  middle of the  afternoon.  What's wrong  with that?  I look good  with my hair  back.  Let's get  Glenn on the  line.  You look good  with your  hair.  Glenn,  you want to  play the movie  game?  I look good  naked, too.  Shut up,  lady.  Too much  information.  Glenn, if you  win these tickets,  you can come  down from  Boston?  No, but if you  guys can hook me  up with tickets to  River Rave, I can go  to that.  Hold on.  Let's see if we  can make that  happen, and we'll  go back to him.  Let's go to Jeff  from Boston. 
[02:05:30]  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, what's up,  guys?  You win the  tickets.  Can you do the  road trip down  to Newark?  Yeah, definitely.  All right, so  you'll join us for  the 2002 Opie and  Anthony Celebrity  softball game,  okay?  Yeah.  It's going to be a  great time.  There's only standing  room tickets available  at this point, so.  Yeah, that's fine.  You know how to  play the movie game,  right?  Yes, I do.  All right, these  two lovely ladies are  going to act out  another scene from  another great guy  moving.  All right, ladies,  you ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  Now, remember, 
[02:06:00]  remember, I'll give  you a little more  motivation.  All right.  Both of you,  during this, both of  you have similar  deliveries.  You're both yelling.  Okay.  Yelling your lines.  Okay?  Yeah, don't hold.  All right, we got you.  Don't hold back.  You're both yelling  your lines.  This is a yelling  scene.  Just pretend she  hid your bottle of  alcohol in your  man.  Who's starting?  Rick.  All right, Marion is  starting the scene.  And remember,  right into the mic. 
[02:06:30]  We're both yelling.  Right in, both yelling.  And when, do you see  the part that is in the  little starred area?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, you described  them what they must do  during that part.  Very good.  But I must...  Ready?  Action!  Go?  Yeah.  All right.  Left shoulder hut!  Private Pyle, what are  you trying to do to my  beloved court?  Sir, I don't know, sir.  You are a dumb  private Pyle, but do  you expect me to  believe that?  Don't left from  right?  Sir.  No, sir.  Then you did that 
[02:07:00]  on purpose.  You want to be  different?  Sir.  No, sir.  Oh, my God.  Hey.  She just smacked  Lady Di.  Cut!  Cut!  Why did you smack  Lady Di?  She's supposed to.  It's in the script.  But you know  something?  You didn't hit her  hard enough.  You gotta hear it.  Yeah.  So, now, Lady Di,  are you against maybe  being smacked in the  face?  All right.  What a better fight.  I don't like being  smacked in the face.  Hit her in the face. 
[02:07:30]  No, you gotta really  hit her.  But hit her hard.  We're not gonna do  that.  I'll go like this.  Man, that face is  gonna jiggle.  You have to hit her.  You're like method actors  and for the last 30  years you've been  playing someone that  eats compulsively.  All right.  Here we go.  Sit him and sit.  All right.  Ready?  All right, ladies.  Let's start over.  Start over and  remember.  Remember, you're  yelling.  Yelling.  Very good.  Okay.  And...  We are yelling.  And...  Ready?  Action.  Left shoulder. 
[02:08:00]  Hi.  Private problem.  What are you trying  to do to my  beloved corpse?  Sir.  I don't know, sir.  You are a dumb  private problem.  Do you expect me to  believe you don't  know left from right?  Sir.  No, sir.  Then you did that  on purpose.  You want to be  different?  Sir.  No, sir.  What side was that,  private pile?  Sir.  Left side, sir.  Are you sure,  private pile?  Sir.  Right side, sir. 
[02:08:30]  Don't ask with me  again, pile.  Pick up your  effing cover, pile.  Sir.  Yes, sir.  You're smacking her  in all the wrong  spots.  Were you paying  attention?  Yes.  No, you weren't.  You're supposed to  smack me.  She said, sir,  left, sir,  and you smacked her  again and then said,  are you sure?  All right.  Look, this is the  best we can do  with this scene.  Oh, my dear,  sweet.  What if you've done  to my beloved corpse?  What are you trying  to do with my  beloved body?  My beloved corpse. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, can I walk  over and smack you?  No.  There's nothing  beloved about your corpse.  All right.  I guess Jeff.  It's the Boston.  Jeff, if you...  Look, Jeff is disgusting.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Jeff, judging by...  or deciding by  what you've just heard,  what movie were  they acting from?  I have no idea, man.  I'm going to have to  go with a guess  and say Thin Red Line.  Oh, no.  What kind of guy  are you?  Wow.  I'm not good at what I get.  All right, don't say.  All right, don't say it. 
[02:09:30]  Sorry, Jeff, go.  Let's go to Mark.  Change your tampon.  Mark, what scene  were they acting in?  Well, what movie  were they acting from?  Was it the Trainables video?  No.  Oh, it's Full Metal Jacket.  Full Metal Jacket.  Full Metal Jacket.  Mark, you got a pair of things  to the 2002  Open Anthony Celebrity  softball game, right?  Cool.  Hold on.  Sponsored by Coors Light.  Hold on.  Sure.  The one time  she could have saved herself  the embarrassment  of saying an S in Coors.  Yeah, I know.  Corpse.  I ain't listening to you, Jeff.  Here's the scene.  Here it is.  For a reference point. 
[02:10:00]  Left shoulder hurt.  Private Pyle,  what are you trying to do  to my beloved car?  Sir, I don't know, sir.  You are dumb, Private Pyle,  but do you expect me  to believe that you  don't know left from right?  Sir, no, sir.  Then you did that  on purpose.  You want to be different.  Sir, no, sir.  What side was that, Private Pyle?  Sir, left side, sir.  Are you sure, Private Pyle?  Sir, yes, sir.  What side was that, Private Pyle?  Sir, right side, sir. 
[02:10:30]  Don't with me again, Pyle.  Pick up your cover.  Sir, yes, sir.  Wow.  What a fantastic scene.  That was a good movie.  I saw that movie.  Well, great.  It's obvious you guys  saw that movie.  Come on.  What do you want me to do?  Go over and really smack her?  You did good.  I've had my chair.  I've had my chair.  What are you trying to do  to my beloved corpse?  Corpse.  We don't smack each other.  Oh, wow.  Is that you?  What?  The good arm  or the gimp one?  Yeah, let's have a round  with you, Jim.  Don't hit me  with the turkey leg arm. 
[02:11:00]  Hit me with the other one.  This turkey leg arm  has to put whatever we got.  What's a left and hook?  I'm not cooking right up.  You really are  a marble-mouthed ass.  Yeah, I don't  I don't quote  with marbles in my mouth.  No, it would probably  clarify things.  Yeah, well.  Obviously not, Jim.  Right.  What is wrong with you?  Did you actually have  a Down syndrome tongue  implanted?  Did I have a what?  Implanted?  Well, you're just  awful.  Why, why, why? 
[02:11:30]  I don't know.  We love you too, Jim.  I'm not a fan gibberish.  All right, listen.  We're going to take a break.  I think we need to continue  with this  to give out  more tickets  to the softball game.  They are both  on the awesome cam  if you want to check them out.  The retarded Laverne and Charlie.  All right.  Ready.  O.B.  You guys are done.  And Anthony.  Wait two minutes.  We'll say something  really dumb.  Let's bring in  the incest couch.  And we're back with the  O.B.  and Anthony show. 
[02:12:00]  Interesting article  on MTV.com, Anthony.  Yes, MTV News  headline section.  For some weird reason,  they have decided,  Interscope has decided  to release the new  M&M CD,  the M&M show,  on May 28th  instead of June 4th.  O.B., I'm seeing a brand  new release date here  that they've pushed  the date off.  And I just can't  for the life of me  figure out why.  But better for the consumer  because they get it quicker.  Just quite frankly,  I think people can't wait  to hear this stuff. 
[02:12:30]  Absolutely.  I love M&M.  O.B., have you noticed  when you go to MTV News  headlines,  it's the top story?  Is it really?  And I'm reading the article  and I, gee,  we come up in it  a couple of times.  They also mention  not only M&M,  but Korn  and SDP.  A little private message,  Anthony.  Yes, yes,  private message.  Get in line and follow. 
[02:13:00]  We'll show you the way.  Ass munches.  Ready to play more  of the movie game, man?  This is becoming  a lot of fun,  this game.  The first time we did it,  I got a bit,  a little bit of a clusterf.  But the girls seem to have  really taken it upon themselves  to brush up  on their acting skills  because sometimes  I can't tell  if we're listening  to a movie clip  or The Retard of Laverne  and Shirley.  Oh, yeah.  Andrew.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  All right, we got to  hurry up here  because we're running  out of time,  but you want to play  the movie game?  Definitely.  All right, you guess the movie,  you'll get tickets  for the softball game, okay? 
[02:13:30]  Rock on.  All right, here we go.  Girls, are you ready?  Yes, we are.  All right, you know  your parts.  And action.  You know me.  You know how I earn a living.  I'll catch this bird for you,  but it ain't gonna be easy.  Bad fish,  not like going down  to the pond  and chasing bluegills.  But Tommy catch  this shark.  Swallow a new hole.  Shake and tenderness.  Down you go.  Now we gotta do it quick.  That'll bring back  all the tourists.  That'll put all your businesses  on a paying basis.  But it's not gonna be pleasant. 
[02:14:00]  I value my neck a lot.  More than the 3,000 bucks.  Chief,  I'll find him for three.  I'll catch him  and kill him for ten.  You gotta make up your mind.  You wanna stay alive  and ain't up.  You wanna play as chief  and be on welfare  the whole winter?  I don't want no volunteers.  I don't want no mates.  There's too many captains  on this island.  Ten thousand dollars  for me, myself,  for that you get the head,  the tail,  the whole damn thing.  Thank you very much,  Mr. Quint.  Well, uh,  take it under advisement. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah?  Marion,  there's another line.  Wow.  I thought Mayor,  chief,  ladies and gentlemen.  You have to ain't up.  That's it.  Okay.  You can't even hear it, though.  You have to ain't up.  Andrew?  Yeah, she read it like,  uh,  you can't even understand  what the hell she was saying.  Oh, we understood.  Aw.  You don't know?  Over the phone?  You don't know the movie?  You can't understand.  All I heard was the other one  at the end.  Well, guess the movie.  Oh. 
[02:15:00]  Take it under.  Oh, their mics are up.  Of course they heard it.  Everyone else heard it?  He just doesn't know.  No, I said it.  He heard it.  I had to talk like Quint.  Yeah, she was just talking weird.  I had to talk like Quint.  That's actually sexier  than an actual voice.  Well, Andrew, just guess.  Take it under advisement.  Take it under advisement.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  You're close.  I can see it.  I'm telling you,  I really couldn't hear it, guys.  Five, four, three,  you know what?  Two, one. 
[02:15:30]  Yes?  Andrew?  Yeah.  Pull in the line.  We'll give you tickets.  Thank you.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  I can't blame him.  Here's a reference point.  Here's the scene.  It's, of course, from Jaws.  It's Jaws.  I don't know what wacky voice  you were doing there.  It was nothing like Quint.  I had to talk like Quint.  It's the Irish guy.  All right.  Here's the scene, man.  Let's talk like Quint.  If you all know me,  you know how I earn a living.  I'll catch this bird for you,  but it ain't going to be easy.  It's a bad fish.  It's not like going down the farm 
[02:16:00]  and chasing bluegills or tommy cards.  This shark,  swallow you whole.  Shaking.  It's a little tenderizing.  Down you go.  Now, we got to do it quick.  I don't bring back the tourists.  I don't put all your businesses  on a paying basis.  But it's not going to be pleasant.  I value my neck a lot more  than 3,000 bucks, chief.  I'll find him for three,  but I'll catch him  and kill him 
[02:16:30]  for 10.  You got to make up your minds.  You want to stay alive  and ante up?  You want to play it cheap?  You're on welfare  the whole winter.  I don't want no volunteers.  I don't want no mates.  There's too many captains  on this island.  $10,000 for me by myself.  For that,  you get the head,  the tail,  the whole damn thing.  Bravo!  Nice, right?  Robert Shaw. 
[02:17:00]  One of the greatest actors  ever on the face of the earth.  Taking a Pelham,  one, two, three.  The deep.  The guy was fantastic.  With that voice.  I thought he did very good.  He was fantastic in that movie.  All right,  let's go right to John in Philly.  John.  All right.  Hello, what's up, guys?  If you win the game,  you can come up for the game, right?  Yeah.  Okay,  that makes sense, right?  Two weeks from tomorrow.  Two weeks from tomorrow,  the celebrity softball game.  It's going to be a great,  great time.  All right.  All right,  ladies,  you ready for your next  script there? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  Are we getting another one?  Sure.  Yeah,  this is a really good one  because they both  have to really work  for this one.  Yeah,  you're both acting  in this one now.  Here's both of your lines.  Lady Di,  this is your time to shine.  Okay.  Don't F up, huh?  Yeah,  don't F up like John.  Hey,  Marion,  say something real fast.  What?  No,  get on mic  and say hi,  John.  Hi,  John,  how you doing?  Hey.  You heard her fine,  right?  Oh,  she sounds great.  Hi.  Okay.  That guy just didn't know  the movie.  I know,  he's a faggot.  Who doesn't know  Jaws?  Faggot.  Yeah,  Jeff from Boston 
[02:18:00]  was a faggot, too.  He didn't want his friends  going,  hey,  faggot,  faggot.  He didn't know  that it was Jaws,  faggot.  Okay,  ready?  I think this is going  to be the last one,  unfortunately.  Yes,  oh,  unfortunately.  Give it your all.  Yes,  we will.  We'll give it your all.  There it is.  All right,  this is it,  ladies.  So really,  yeah,  give it your all  because this is it for you.  All right?  And action.  Company leader,  Colin Raven.  Company leader to Raven.  Talk to me,  Johnny.  Company leaders,  identify Baker Team,  Rambo,  Messner, 
[02:18:30]  Ortega,  Coletta,  Jorgensen,  Danforth,  Barry,  Krakauer,  confirm,  this is Colonel Troutman.  Talk to me,  Johnny.  They're all gone,  sir.  Rambo,  are you all right over?  Baker Team,  they're all dead,  sir.  Not,  not Barry.  He made it.  Barry's gone too,  sir.  How?  Got himself killed  in Nam.  Don't even know it.  Castrated him down  to the bone.  No,  cancer ate him  down to the bone.  That's what I said.  Who typed that?  Castrated? 
[02:19:00]  No.  That's cancer.  All right,  we're running out of time,  though.  Continue.  Keep going.  I'm sorry,  I don't know.  I'm the last one,  sir.  It's good to hear  your voice,  Johnny.  It's been a long time.  Look,  John,  you've done some damage  here,  but they don't want  any trouble.  That's why I've come.  I've got to come in there  and fly you the hell out.  Just you and me.  We'll work this thing  out together.  Is that fair enough?  Where'd you come from,  sir?  Bragg.  Bragg.  I tried to get 
[02:19:30]  in touch with you,  but the guys  at Bragg  never knew  where to find you.  I haven't been  spending much time  there lately.  They've got me in D.C.  I'm sharing a seat  with my ass.  My A.  Shining.  I wish I was  back at Bragg now.  We'll talk about that  when you come in.  I can't do that,  sir.  Well,  look,  John,  we can't have you  running around out there  wasting friendly civilians.  There are no  friendly civilians.  Well,  I'm your friend,  Johnny.  I was there with you,  knee deep  in all the blood and guts. 
[02:20:00]  I covered your butt  more than once.  Seems like  bailing you out  trouble is getting  to be a lifetime job  for me.  There wouldn't be  no trouble  except for that  King S.  cop.  All I wanted  was something to eat,  but the man  kept pushing,  sir.  Well,  you did some pushing  of your own,  John.  They drew first blood,  not me.  Well,  let me come in  and get you  the hell out of there.  They drew first blood.  Look at,  you hear John  from Philly,  our contestant 
[02:20:30]  moaning,  just like,  oh,  God.  Isn't it painful?  You were wincing,  John.  Blaine.  this scene.  Thank you,  Marion and Brian Regan.  They're all gone,  sir.  Sir?  Oh,  they drew first blood.  Oh,  I see where they're  going with this one.  I want to be back  and brag.  They hit me  with a pop tart.  All right,  John from Philly,  what movie were they  acting out there?  That's the classic  scene at the end  of Rambo,  first blood.  Oh,  yeah,  John.  Exactly,  you got it right. 
[02:21:00]  Talk to me,  Johnny.  And we don't have  time to play  the actual scene.  No,  we don't.  We have run out  of show.  John,  we're going to see  you at the  celebrity softball  game,  okay?  Nice.  Hold on the line,  John.  Get over it,  Johnny.  Hold on,  man.  John from Philly.  Bravo.  And that's how  we wrap up  a crazy week  of radio,  Ant.  Zainerific.  I want to thank  the ladies,  Lady Di and Marion.  Lady Di did very well  there.  Yes,  yes.  Thank you very much.  Sylvester Stallone  impression.  Very nice.  Andrew Gore,  real fast,  he's going to be  at the tattoo  show at Roseland. 
[02:21:30]  He's our new  friend.  Check out  satansideshow.com.  Yeah,  I have ten  of the Kathleen's  put your goddamn  clothes back on  t-shirts that I  printed out as a  special gift for  O&A when they  came to D.C.  I have ten of  them left,  and I'm giving  them away for  free to the  first ten girls  that wow me at  the Roseland  tattoo show this  weekend.  You're a smart  man.  You're a smart  man.  They have to do  it to me, 
[02:22:00]  and we'll get a  picture,  and I'll put it  up on the  website.  Good boy.  Very good.  We can't F  around.  We've got to  get the F out  of here.  Real quick,  YV from  Queens,  I learned that  O&A listeners  had to go  through an  audio holocaust  just to win  free tickets.  Audio holocaust.  Nice.  Hey, man,  we had a lot  of fun this  week,  and thanks for  the support.  We got really  good news here  in New York.  We did really,  really well.  Yes,  thank you.  And another  show that did  really,  really well here  in New York  is up next,  Ron and Fez.  Yes.  Here's something 
[02:22:30]  that no one  will write about.  I've got to  say it again.  At this moment  in time,  this radio station  in New York,  WNEW,  from 3 in the  afternoon all  the way to  midnight,  that's our show  and Ron and Fez's  show there,  is beating K-Rock  across the  effing board.  Very good.  And that makes  us smile.  Yes.  Big time today.  Yay!  So stay tuned  for Ron and Fez.  It's the big night  of fights up,  too.  I think I'm heading  out there to  Jersey.  Check it out.  Ain't gonna work,  Jimmy.  It kinda worked.  He knows.  I saw his little 
[02:23:00]  blue eyes glance  over.  Hitler would've  been proud of  you,  blonde-haired,  blue-eyed fella.  I had to confess.  I was like,  oh, I confess.  I confess.  Those were my  eyes shifting. </pre>
