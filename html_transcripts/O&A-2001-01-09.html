<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured a mix of planned segments and impromptu conversations, resulting in a highly offensive and sexually explicit program.  The show began with comedian Brian Regan as a guest.  They reminisced about Regan's past appearances, discussed the evolution of the show's format (removing music and implementing a delay), and Regan’s experiences performing clean comedy.  Callers shared anecdotes about Regan's comedic bits, including one about a man upset by the word "pissed off" and another who received a reckless driving ticket from laughing too hard.  The conversation also included discussions of Regan’s CD, Evel Knievel and his son Robbie, donut shops, and childhood science projects.  Jim Brewer, a former Saturday Night Live cast member, joined the studio at this point.

The tone shifted drastically when the conversation turned to John Rocker, with the hosts, Regan, and Brewer engaging in extensive, explicitly racist and homophobic commentary about Rocker and his planned train journey through New York City.  This segment was rife with racial and ethnic slurs, graphic descriptions of violence and sexual acts, and a brief discussion of a sex toy.  The hosts then played a song about killing a kitten followed by "Full Blown AIDS," sparking further discussion about the song's offensive lyrics, which graphically described the deterioration of someone with AIDS.

Steven Lynch then joined the studio, participating in a humorous back-and-forth about whether he would perform "Full Blown AIDS," which he eventually did.  This was followed by the "What's in your Pants?" segment, where callers described their pubic hair while rubbing a phone against their genitals, with Buddy Hackett providing remote commentary.  Hackett shared anecdotes from his career.

The show continued with a sexually suggestive conversation with a caller named Patty, who was seemingly just coming from sex. This led to an impromptu studio party with frequent caller Archie, who played explicit audio recordings of his sexual encounters with Edith, attributed to Viagra.  The conversation included explicit details of Archie's daughter's sex life and his own encounters.  Mike DiNicolo performed a spoken word piece with graphic and morbid lyrics about AIDS and STDs, followed by a discussion of various sexual positions. Adam Ferrara's experiences living with a girlfriend and her extensive shoe collection were discussed.

Otto and George, a ventriloquist and his puppet, joined, delivering sexually explicit jokes, crude humor about Kathie Lee Gifford, and insulting banter with the hosts.  A listener called with a plan to make a pornographic film with Opie and Anthony as directors.  The show concluded with Julie and Rodney visiting the studio; Julie flashed her breasts, prompting highly inappropriate comments from the hosts and George.  The broadcast ended with a continued stream of sexual innuendo and inappropriate jokes.

[00:03:30]  play any music anymore no music no no any w the rock of new york we don't play music anymore oh no  are you allowed to uh you know just break in the song yourselves yeah yeah we yeah i don't think  we've done that we had a clip of opi singing yesterday it wasn't very attractive tell you  the truth and then people calling that is not what we're used to you normally don't do that 
[00:04:00]  so don't do that this is not what i'm used to this is different from what my normal daily experience  you like everything else in my life that's ryan from a year and a half ago voice from the past  we have played that clip has to be a hundred times oh man has to be a hundred times man  so no music you guys just sit here and uh talk about the day and just yap and trade stocks and 
[00:04:30]  pretty much yeah yeah we don't we don't even talk about the day usually no  every once in a while you realize the mic is on you gotta come over and say something  sometimes uh an inadvertent curse goes out over that's why they put us since you you were here  we weren't even on a delay when you were here we are now on i swear to god i drive home i listen  to the show that's how much of a delay they have put us on now now 40 seconds so like if i said uh 
[00:05:00]  what did you say  see we're on a very long delay not only us but there's a guy in a room down the hall swear to god  who has two more buttons i actually walk by that room it's like a big giant round button it's about  three feet diameter and he just sits here and hits it he hits it every time you hear something bad  coming through it's a circus so that's uh press the button so that's what we've been up to the 
[00:05:30]  past uh couple of years when what you've been doing touring around i want to curse yeah see it  was fun wasn't it it was fun i watched you do that and i could yeah i can you know it just seemed like  can i say you never curse no i don't we'll give you a curse yeah go ahead opie get ready on the  button no but make it good yeah if you're gonna curse make it good because the three people on hold  will hear i i just want to make sure that uh that they're on the button because uh you can't be  fired by the fcc damn whoa 
[00:06:00]  i hope they got that i hope they got that because uh you're out there man well i feel bad because  at any you know you guys would be the ones off the air you know what i'm saying that's okay if that  were to slip through ah the electronic equipment never ever fails that's the wonder of technology  technology i had a guy i i do work clean i had a guy come up to me after a show one time i used  the expression um pissed off i don't i don't even know if i can say that here oh yeah you can say 
[00:06:30]  pissed which i thought was you know when the parameters of cleanliness and this guy came up  up to me after the show just shaking his head no saying you know i've always appreciated the fact  that you work clean oh my god i brought my uh my sister out she likes clean comedy and you had to  say pissed off that's a little much i don't know what to do you know and i actually ended up taking 
[00:07:00]  it out of my act you know like man i'm offending people left and right with my language you're crazy  it's like showtime at the apollo with you i am out there riding the edge without a helmet  so no more that language if you come out you're gonna be hearing that kind of talk  doesn't work blue no i woke up the next day after seeing you and i couldn't breathe my ribs hurt  i was laughing so hard thanks he was beat up after he left yeah i got hijacked but 
[00:07:30]  i was caught i was mad at your language or something and left the club beating everybody  senseless it was amazing you hear what he said pissed off i gotta hit you now i brought my favorite  nun and he uses that kind of language somebody's gonna pay is that what the case is now in the  audience because a lot of comics don't work clean so you must get everybody that can only see  clean comics busloads of uh handicapped children nuns what i don't know why they they would need 
[00:08:00]  it to be clean but uh yes you know how they like clean um actually i don't really promote the fact  that it's clean because yeah you know then people think it's like you know religious yeah you know  that it's like really not too on a wholesome side you know and it's like i i like to think what i do is  you know i don't know i don't know i don't want to pat myself on the back i was going to use the word  good but i'm self-serving i think it's adequate i'm good that's what i tell clubs to put it on the 
[00:08:30]  marquee adequate comedy he's good brian reagan i'm good yeah like how they have uh  you should have reporters and names of uh critics that say how the act was just put brian reagan  brian reagan says i'm good oh no make the retard face put it on a poster and have it outside the  comedy clubs i'm good i'm gonna come out as being cocky now i hope they hit the delay button on that 
[00:09:00]  you know cocky no you still haven't no good i don't want to be saying that i'm all right i guess  adequate yeah adequate adequate comedy uh more than adequate my god man anyway you're trying to sell  some seats over here they're probably for the love of god listening go oh my god he's saying he's  adequate people are calling to cancel you know i was we were gonna go see that guy but adequate i 
[00:09:30]  mean is that worth a saturday night i was looking at someone coming in that's a little more mediocre  is that adequate guy coming back to town soon i never felt such an adequate show  so you know hopefully people you know do a little chuckling or whatever sure they they will they  certainly will we had a whole discussion because of you uh we played one of your uh tracks off your  cd are you still selling that cd anywhere uh because i had to order the damn thing yeah you 
[00:10:00]  can get it on the internet and stuff like that and it's also in certain you know like uh certain  music stores yeah one of the funniest cds you'll ever hear but there's an evil kenevil bit on there  that made us discuss evil kenevil all afternoon long well we probably grew up around the same time so  evil kenevil was a huge thing on tv we had a discussion ryan who was cooler  evil kenevil or his son robbie and we just figured robbie's a he's a puss he doesn't jump  like his father yeah yeah because the father just didn't have shocks he didn't have a ramp 
[00:10:30]  really computerized ramp so they know exactly the angle evil just set up some plywood on some  on a fence and then flopped on the the concrete for a while i like the uh the bales of hay at the  end what kind of safety feature is like eight stacks of you know little squares of hay stacked  up at the end you know but they still do it robbie's still yeah like that's gonna help me when 
[00:11:00]  he went headlong into that when he went up the grand canyon you know he fell off and don't worry he hit  the hay he's all right ladies and gentlemen pillow soft bales of hay this stuff's like concrete  for god they should take the medians down off the long island expressway and just sack hay  hay from here all the way out to the tip of long island oh that track the trailer cut me off i  did 80 into the uh median thank god it was hay honey are you nodding off at the wheel 
[00:11:30]  sweetie what are you worried about they got hay it's all stacked up they're replacing the airbag now  big bell of hay shoots out of your steering wheel when when you hit something well you know what i  think is weird too about uh robbie knievel first of all robbie i mean he you know he that grand  canyon thing i saw it uh repeated the other night that was pretty you know no parachute the whole thing  yeah yeah i don't know how you know i don't know how deep it was you know maybe they picked a part of  the grand canyon it was like three feet deep it's gonna take another six billion years of water 
[00:12:00]  dripping for it to be impressive when the grand canyon is completed this would have been an  impressive jump yeah no i think it was deep in the whole nine yards you know but he still wears  his dad's clothes yeah he jumps that's what i think that's a little weird yeah you know it's like  that 70s red white and blue you know leather outfit steve a knievel outfit there the superhero outfit  you know what i think i don't think the whole daredevil world is uh regulated you know there's 
[00:12:30]  no governing body so they're getting away with murder i saw a motorcycle jump show you know some  daredevil show and they said this guy was going to jump um i think it was like 30 stretch limousines  yeah and then they show those stretch limousines and they're all lined up side by side they're all  touching each other who cares that they're stretched you know aren't volkswagen bugs about the same way  you gotta be kidding me what does that have to do with anything you know so i'm surprised some 
[00:13:00]  guy doesn't like attempt to jump like an entire like amtrak train you know but put the ramps up  like on the side you can do it on a bicycle 37 cars ladies and gentlemen  either that or we need a governing body for the for the thrill seekers out there there's gotta be a body  all right let's take a a break and uh breathe our guest today brian reagan we love brian reagan 
[00:13:30]  we gotta quickly go to the phones here kristin is dying to talk to brian  hi hey kristin you're on the radio with brian reagan oh my god i'm so excited i think you're the best  ever kristin thank you so much you're welcome i love the bit that you do about um the cobweb 
[00:14:00]  right you're walking out she's kind of dumb to do on the radio  to do on the radio but it's really nice of you to to say that you like it thank you oh look he's  doing it now yeah come on brian walk walk into the wind again for us come on i'll just do it and  hopefully then people out there can you know hopefully they laugh so hard they drive into a  bail a hay but uh you know it's just when you're walking on the street and you know you walk into  a spider web you know it looks stupid because nobody else sees the web they just see you walking 
[00:14:30]  off in the distance suddenly flipping out for no reason whatsoever you know you're just walking along  you're pulling stuff off yeah people going what happened to him that man his behavior  it's it's different than what it was  so we are uncomfortable with that  i actually did that bit on the cd which is very hard because the whole joke is completely visual right 
[00:15:00]  so as i'm doing the cd i had to try to explain with words like things that i would do you know like  like that so you know you're sitting there flailing and grabbing things up i'm going oh man this is way  too wordy i have another bit you know where like i have to wave you know that the visual and the  joke is me waving and then as i'm doing it for the cd i realized nobody can see this so i had to say  so you're just kind of you know waving uncomfortably there i hope this is playing to the listeners 
[00:15:30]  i just imagine people listening to the cd what the hell is guy talking about  pulling stuff off his body and awkwardly waving i love the thing that you do where it's like uh  youtube the wrong thing yeah we love the youtube youtube we say that all the time all right you  must get that all the time brian no it's coming up to you it's a nice it's a nice compliment yeah  thank you kristin thanks kristin oh god damn that's funny thanks man you know the uh 
[00:16:00]  uh on the cd they have uh you know i just you just do an hour and then they just you know put  it together it's seamless when you listen to it sure but um the producer wanted bit titles i guess  they can break it up into different uh bits even though when you're listening it doesn't fade out  and go into the next joke so you needed like bit titles and there was a deadline for him so i was in  an airport like on a with a bank of pay phones and i had like this list of bit titles you know and 
[00:16:30]  there was like a businessman to my right and like this you know woman standing on my left and i'm on  the phone going um donut lady  then stupid in school  then feeling lousy  you just wonder what is this guy talking about who's he talking to do you still do donut lady in  your act sometimes i i don't usually i sometimes i do i try to mix it up every show you 
[00:17:00]  you know so it's uh a little bit different but yeah you know i because i feel bad for the i i feel  bad for the donut ladies because people can't make up their mind you know when you go in there i don't  know what it is about buying donuts that make people freak out you know that they go in there okay  okay okay all right um okay i i want a dozen donuts and uh  you got a lot of donuts

[00:34:00]  Yeah, hey, Brian, I'm a big fan.  Thanks, man.  Yeah, I was just wondering, one of my favorite bits you do is the phone,  when people call you up with the wrong phone numbers.  Right.  I wonder if you can do that.  Well, what's weird is people call you up and, you know, they ask for a name,  you tell them it's the wrong number, and they don't believe that.  That's what just kills me.  How can they not, why would you make that up, you know?  And so then they have to tell you the telephone number that they're trying to dial,  like, they're like, this isn't 2-1-3, 3-1-2-5. 
[00:34:30]  So they don't believe me anyway.  So I just, I go like a million miles from there.  No, this is 9-9-8-7-9-9-9.  What the hell's wrong with you?  What are you, drunk?  You're drunk, aren't you?  The guy won't try again for like an hour.  Oh, man.  I wasn't even close.  Honey, you dial. 
[00:35:00]  I think I had the phone upside down.  There you have it, Ty.  All right, thanks, Skippy McGee.  Skippy.  Oh, okay.  Now I'm having trouble breathing.  Brian, thank you so much.  Thank you so much for having me on, man.  Appreciate it.  Brian Ray.  All owned by Infinity Broadcasting. 
[00:35:30]  This is 1027 WNEW, New York.  All right, we got to do a radio show, I guess, at some point.  Yeah.  Just jamming in the studio.  Keep playing, man.  We're just playing air guitar.  No one can see what we're doing.  We're doing four horsemen.  All right, Jim Brewer, a huge Met fan.  Fellow Met fan.  Last night, you know. 
[00:36:00]  I know I'm not the only Met fan.  No offense, John Rocco.  Nice guy.  I mean, John Franco.  That's how rattled I am.  John Franco, man.  This is John Franco.  Here's an impression of John Franco every game.  Oh, come on!  Come on!  Come on!  Damn it!  Take him out!  That's every Met fan watching John Franco.  Well, while we're talking about sports, your favorite...  Bring him on!  Your favorite relief pitcher is coming down.  Bring him on.  You know, he's two feet...  He's about two jeans from barking. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah.  He's a jackass.  Scooby-Doo.  Okay, first of all, can I have the microphone?  First of all, all I need to say is that the Jews with AIDS can take the chinks and the African  negris and show up their balloon snout.  All right?  Because I'm riding the seven train.  Let me tell you something about negris.  First of all, they're lazy.  Okay?  Can you go get me a beer?  Thank you.  Second of all, the chinks got nothing to do but hang out with faggots with AIDS and stick 
[00:37:00]  that up your chink hole.  I'm riding the seven, Paul.  Hold on.  I got a crap.  Let me just throw this over here.  What?  You've never seen a guy throw his own feces?  You want to see how fast I can throw a ball?  What a retard.  He should come on the field and, you know, one of them chairs. 
[00:37:30]  I can't stand him.  I hope he gets hemorrhoids for like a year straight, the signs of that chick's boobs.  I'm sticking out of his rectum, shack-ass.  He does say that he will be riding the seven train.  God, don't you just want to kick it right in the poop sky?  And the funny thing is he had announced that, so now we're going to have a ton of security  on the seven train with Mr. Rocker.  Well, now, the Post has all the towns that he'll be going through.  Yeah.  And what they're composed of.  Yeah.  He's a pure retard. 
[00:38:00]  Anyone that runs, he runs to the mound.  He runs to the mound.  Yeah, yeah.  He does.  You know, the feelers are going, hey, retard!  It's right field.  Where you going?  Look at this retard run.  Dude.  Blacks with AIDS and Jews and jinx.  Oh, my.  Dude.  You got to do your impression.  I'm sorry to put you on the spot of John Rocker throwing a ball. 
[00:38:30]  Even though it's a visual.  I didn't throw it.  It was going.  Even though it's a visual.  He looks like that retard you get when, you know.  Look at this idiot.  It was even worse.  It was like, you know, all the retard Atlanta fans going, he's a hero.  Here he comes. 
[00:39:00]  He's a hero.  Hey, John, can you throw your own feces for us?  Can you throw our own feces?  We hate niggers and spits and jews all night, too.  Oh, we love you.  Niggers with AIDS.  Hee-haw, hee-haw.  Sinks with Jews.  Hee-haw, hee-haw.  We Atlanta's love John Rocker.  They're going to string us up, a nigger, and give him some AIDS.  Oh, my God.  And then show them more on the cemetery. 
[00:39:30]  There you go.  There you go.  There's a nigger, and then show them more on the cemetery.  I'm going to throw a ball, play it again, and it gets me all hopped up.  You can't see it, but Brewer's going to dislocate his shoulder in a minute.  I'm hiccuping.  I'm laughing so hard.  And then give him a standing ovation.  Whatever.  Now, he's going to hop on the 7 train and have to go through Sunnyside, 
[00:40:00]  which is a predominantly Asian community.  I don't think...  No, I don't know.  Giuliani's trip.  Listen, just ignore him.  Yeah, ignore him.  Just don't even go to his level.  Yeah, like no one's going to throw a battery on the field.  Woodside.  I bet that Giuliani's the first one to throw something at him.  Oh, my God.  And then you got Woodside.  Woodside, Woodside.  Irish.  A lot of Irish in Woodside.  So I guess he'll be picking up some support in Woodside. 
[00:40:30]  Then into Jackson Heights.  Hispanic and Indian.  There you go.  Some of those 20-year-old girls with four children that he was talking about.  Too bad the 7 couldn't stop in Jamaica.  Yeah, maybe they ought to change the track.  Let him out in Jamaica.  Oops, I don't know how we ended up in Jamaica.  And then, of course, right before Shay, Corona.  Corona?  Yes, black, Italian, and Hispanic. 
[00:41:00]  Right there.  Yeah, it's all the fat monkeys with the AIDS over there.  You got the fat monkeys and the Jews and all of them.  The African Negroes.  They don't even know what they want to call themselves anymore.  Lazy bastards.  Hey, bad boy, get my ball, would you?  Look at his face.  He's a retard.  He's three chains from drooling.  What an idiot.  Tell me.  Well, what I like to do in my pastime is I like to take a nice-sized watermelon and I  sig it out and I let it get to about 90 degrees. 
[00:41:30]  I cut a hole in it and I hump it for an hour.  And then I run as fast as I can to the mound and I just pray that there's a nice  nigger with AIDS so I can throw a ball straight at his rectum.  I hate the chinks.  They're the worst.  Oh, we love you, John.  They should be proud in Atlanta.  They wonder why they've been there nine years in a row and they lose every year.  Yeah.  How pathetic is that?  They blow.  They blow hard.  Well, you know something?  Chipper. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, I'm chipper.  Chipper.  Yeah, Larry, get up to bat, knucklehead.  Chipper.  Chipper Jones.  A security force of 500 cops on hand for his little train ride.  Tax dollars.  Why?  Thank you, John Rocker.  We've got to pay for him insulting us.  Why do we have to protect him?  It's the same reason they put the bulletproof vests on the child molesters coming out of  the courtrooms.  And those things are heavy.  Believe me, it was so uncomfortable walking out of there.  Bulletproof vests.  No, because they've got to protect these people. 
[00:42:30]  Why?  I don't know.  I don't know.  If he wants to ride the 7 train, let him ride it.  Let him go.  I'm waiting for it.  It's battery day here at Shea Stadium.  Battery day.  Duracell sponsoring this.  Return of John Rocker to Shea Stadium.  Look, there's a happy young fan lofting his Duracell D into the outfield.  And once again...  As he runs to the mound.  Once again, here's the other side of the issue.  Yeah.  Vinny?  Oh, no.  Let me tell you something.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Vinny.  Vinny the racist.  When this guy gets on the train, New York should congratulate him and shake his hand 
[00:43:00]  because everything he said was true.  And you know, he gets an O&A.  Every time a fan drops into New York City, I got a shit.  Oh, no.  His phone.  You know what happened?  You know what?  The goddamn negras wrecked his phone line.  It's the negras.  Of course.  They make the trip.  Whatever they do, it's a freaking nigger.  I'll tell you straight out what it is.  Oh, Jesus.  My pizza, I got cramp in.  I bet you nigger made it. 
[00:43:30]  That's what happened.  Vinny the racist has his own special point of view, and obviously he wasn't able to come  across with it, but I'm sure it would have involved calling people bad things.  Yes.  Thank God his phone dropped out.  Is Rocker actually from Boston?  Is he?  No, he's from what I'm hearing.  What?  No, he says he's from American, Georgia.  Where is he from?  He says he's from Georgia.  He's from Georgia?  Yeah.  Oh.  The outskirts.  I was going to say, it would make more sense if he was from Boston. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, it would.  It really would.  We went off yesterday about how racist Boston is.  I played up there a couple months ago.  It was great.  I was right by the market.  Yeah, yeah.  Daniel Hall.  Yeah.  Three cucumbers for a dollar.  A dollar.  One dollar for all you negros over here.  You got $2.50 for the goddamn Dominicans.  Come over here and get it for a dollar, people.  A dollar.  Come on this side.  I'll stomp a mud hole in your rectum, you four negros.  Yeah, they're rough, man. 
[00:44:30]  They don't play.  No, they don't play at all.  You get more value for your dollar.  Yeah.  A dollar.  What?  Yeah.  George from East Meadow.  They should have Queer Day at Shea when Rocker Highs.  Oh, that would be hilarious.  Yeah.  Invite them to the gay parade.  I should have to hold everyone.  It should be Hispanic, African-American, Jew.  AIDS Day.  Gay AIDS Day.  And every single mother.  We should be really nice to them.  It would throw them off. 
[00:45:00]  It's Dirty Syringe Day at Shea.  People loving Dirty Syringes.  Throw your pooper day here at Shea in honor of John Rocker.  John, we love you.  We're just like you.  You know what's going to happen?  He's going to get on a train with 500 police officers and nobody's going to be around.  They might screen a couple of people.  You know when politicians go to, like, the local diner?  You think the average Joe is walking in that diner?  No.  They screen everybody who's going to sit down in there.  They're going to screen everyone that goes in the car he's in. 
[00:45:30]  And there might be, like, one opportunity where some intelligent gentleman will walk up  and maybe have a little back and forth with John Rocker.  You know, John, do you believe these things that you said are, in fact, true?  Ah!  And that'll be it.  A little sound bite for the news.  I don't even, you know what?  I don't even care.  You know, people say they saw me in Comedy Central doing him.  I was pissed at him before he said all this.  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah, that was recorded before.  That was before all this came out. 
[00:46:00]  He was a retard before that.  I was pissed at him before that.  Yeah.  And Mets fans hate him because of what a retard.  It's fucking bitch going out!  Obi and Anthony.  1027 WNEW.

Come on  Sing the song  They wrote the song  You wrote it?  Sing it  You and Mike wrote it 
[01:05:00]  Me and Mike  Look  Jay seems so offended  Every time Mike wrote a line  He'd pass it to Jay  Jay would read it  And start laughing hysterical  It's a funny song  So?  Alright Mike  Come here  Sing the song  Why won't you sing it?  Mike really can't sing  I really have a bad voice  But that mic's not on  Because Mike's saying  Voice moise  It doesn't matter  Come on  Sing the song  Steven why won't you sing it?

Well, I don't think she probably  And then I get on stage  Do a couple cutesy jokes  And everybody gets mad at me  Yeah, I don't know what the whole thing is behind the girls 
[01:33:00]  But I think her relationship with her family  Was gone a long time before that shot  And she's a beautiful girl  I mean, why do I do that?  That's what you do behind closed doors  What do you want, ugly girls in there?  No, what I'm saying is  You do this like in private  This kind of thing  Hey, Patty  Well, you like to think  With attractive girls  That doesn't happen  And then we go home  With all these sick ideas in our head  Let's ask Patty  Are you blaming Penthouse  For the way men think?  Well, just say, you know  Penthouse, porno movies  Porno?  You were coming out against pornography?  No, no

Yes, I do  In the archives  He was the first gentleman  On the cover of Playboy  Yes, I was  There you go  All right, but enough of that  Kenny's issue  The dice pages are stuck together  There's nothing wrong with porno  You're in the hotel room  You put on porno  You wake up in the morning  You put on porno  Let's ask Patty  If she likes porno  Patty, what's your cup of tea  As far as pornography?  What do you like?  I very rarely look at it  Very rarely  Even by the magazines

You can't touch her breast  You're going to go to prison  Come on  This is alright  She's waiting for this  Oh, wow  Yeah, she's a nice girl  She's a nice girl  Do it from behind  Come up behind her  Jim, she's been waiting a long time  To reach around  40  Why didn't you just hand me duct tape  And a knife  Sneak up behind her  Just kick her door in  And attack her  I didn't say sneak  Oh, I'm just saying  You crushed the tool  Against  Somebody get Billy Bob Thornton  From Sling Blade  Maybe you guys can fool around  That'd be nice  I feel guilty 
[01:45:30]  Norton, a lot of people  Calling you a fag  On the instant feedback  I'm not a fag  I just have morals  I'm a nice guy  I'm a good person  Well, let's ask Patty  Patty, what are you thinking?  I have morals too  But I'm a team player  Alright, I'll touch your breast  Now she's asking for it  There it is  Alright, this will be the first  Norton, this is how I want it  This is the first time  Patty's had a man touch  Dice wants to choreograph  You come up behind her  Nicey nice  It looks like choreographing  A plane wreck  It's just going to happen  We start crushing the tool 
[01:46:00]  Like against her phone  No, she doesn't want to be  Humped  I don't want to  Yeah, I don't want to  And then the hands  Slowly come up  Yeah, let's keep this respectful  It's going to be  I'm giving you a scene  This is going to be like  A purse snatching  This is not going to be  A long, drawn-out  Filmed episode  Nice  But you've got to do it nice  I'm going to do it nice  Patty's terrific  From behind, we like it like that  Why don't we ask Patty  What she wants  Patty, what's your fantasy?

[01:46:30]  From behind, right?  So you get a little pullback  You want it to dry hump you?  No, I think what you've got to do  Is hands on the shoulders  From behind  Then you go your hands  Down the arms  To the sides  And then back up  The sides to the front  What do the shoulders have?  No, just let her know you're there  Can't you go around her belly?  You show some romance, Dice  And then the hands come up  Jesus  That is romance  The shoulders  The shoulders  You pull the hair away  You get a little neck  You get down the shoulders  Let me tell you something  When he's behind her 
[01:47:00]  Shut up  Shut your mouth  When he's behind her  Yeah  And he's got his teeth  Like in her neck, right?  Right  Biting her neck out  From knowledge  You can't bite her  No, like, you know  Like a hickey thing  Right  And then the hands  Come up slowly  Okay  They slowly circle  The oreoles  The oreoles  Double stuff  No, now I'm using  The genitalia  Oh, I see that  And then you give it  Like a squeeze  Like toilet paper  My hands are going to move  You ever see Ollie  Punching Liston  In the second fight?

To that song  Right 
[01:48:00]  You want it done like Sea of Love  Just pushed against a wall?  Yeah, what type of  You want it rough?  You want it nice and gentle?  Sea of Love would be nice  Because then I could have a pistol put in the back of my head  And my brain's blown all over a pillow  What, did you ever see the movie?  That's what happened  No, you're doing like in Apocalypse Now  When Michael Douglas pushed against the wall  He wasn't in Apocalypse Now  No, when he came in to the room  And he was like crazy  Nice  You know what I mean?  What?  Package  Package to India  Package to India  Oh my God  Right?

This is her thing  It's like losing her virginity  Oh, just about  This is the best it's ever going to get  I guess the first way you described it  With the hands down the shoulders  Forget the shoulders  The shoulders are nice  What's wrong with you?  All right, I like  You've got to start slow  Shoulders  Now arms got to come into it  Well, sorry  When there's a line of girls there  Maybe you can't spend a little time with them, dice  How about  I told them, bite her neck a little 
[01:49:00]  How about  Bite her neck?  What are you, Nosferatu?  What the hell is this?  Who's she nice?  How about  Jim holds her like  They're getting ready for a prom photo  And then he goes out  You want that one?  A little too stage  No, we need both hands  Because we've got two things to cover  Right  Exactly  I'm going to stand behind her  I'm going to grab her breasts  And I'm going to apologize  Like the Janet Jackson cover photo  Of Rolling Stone  You've got to do it slowly  Because so she gets a sensation  Right  This has to be a whole moment  Not just this quick  Top of feel 
[01:49:30]  Like someone bumping her on the sidewalk  Jim, try to tune in Tokyo, you know  Be nice  Be gentle  Because when you cause the sensation there  Here we go  It goes down to  I think we're all ready  I think we're all ready  This is the first time  Patty's ever been felt up  So refrain from  Smashing over the head  With a spade shovel  When you're done  Because we know how  You usually work  Yeah, I don't want to get  Emotions involved  Jim, pull  Where's the music?

A little weird  Oh, now he's  Whoa  He tweaked  But you don't go right for a nipple tweak  You just gotta rub your hands  On the front first  Watch the music  Wow  What was next?  Penetration?  My God, Norton 
[01:50:30]  We gotta try this again  Come on  Yeah, come on  It's not the right move  She went right for the money shot  Norton  She's never gonna forget this moment  It's gotta be sexy  I probably won't  We have different sexual histories  I apologize  Her nips are popping up  Much like a life-altering accident  She'll never forget this  I'm not used to her  Unless she's with a pimp behind her  Hopping in my car  That's what I'm used to  All right  Now you have me  Didn't you appear in a window  In Perth Amboy recently?  What am I doing?  I'm filling up a 45-year-old virgin 
[01:51:00]  This is not right  God almighty  I'm gonna go to  My parents are listening to this  Oh my God  All right  Let's go  All right  Let's go for  One more  Take two  Be a little more  Don't go right for the tweak  That's what I do  I apologize  Right for the tweak  Why don't you get me a catcher's mitt  And I'll rub the  I mean, what do you want me to do?

[01:52:00]  Could you put the music back on?  All right  Here we go  Some smooth music  Is Dice gonna talk him through it?  You wanna talk him through this?

Right  All hookers  George you get anything  That looks like that  Or what?  In your dreams  Nah  Alright well we got  Just a sick story  Oh yeah  That has been brought  To our attention Anthony  Wow it's just something  You never hear about  15 year old  Learning disabled boy  Found locked 
[02:28:30]  In a bathroom stall  By the child's father  After he didn't  Return from  From the bathroom  They were at some  Men's room  At Tobey Beach  In Massapequa  And guess who was  In there with him  Locked in there with him  A 69 year old  Retired priest  Awful  Isn't that great?  15 year old  Learning disabled boy  And then his father  He went to the bathroom 
[02:29:00]  He hadn't come back  For a while  So he goes to the  Bathroom to check  And he's locked in there  With Andrew Miller  69 year old  Former priest  Retired priest  Who has been charged  With sodomy  Yeah  Yeah  You gotta love the sodomy  Rush this drool  Over to forensics  Right away  Look the catholic church  Denies these guys  Sex  They can't get married  You can't blame them  You know  Bang a retard 
[02:29:30]  Once in a while  George  You can't say that  It's not his fault  It's not his fault  It's a basic human need  Why do they always  Pick boys  That's a good question  I don't know  They might be a little  Fond of you  Kind of a little guy  I don't know  It's kind of hard  To hang out  In a ladies room  For two hours  Waiting for a retard  To walk in  George  You're out of control  Today  You obviously  Didn't get to sleep  Last night 
[02:30:00]  I thought you'd be  A little more sensitive  About this story  Oh yeah  A retard  Come on  It's a laugh a minute  Bang him in the bathroom  I'm amazed  The father didn't kill the guy  Yeah  Walking in  And you see some  Some 69 year old priest  Over your son  Like  Yeah  For real  Slamming the back door  Or whatever he was doing  I don't know  He might have been 
[02:30:30]  Getting a hummer  Right  They ought to be  More specific  As to what  Form of sodomy  People are getting  In these news articles  I don't  I don't need to know  You don't want to know  No  You want to know  Why would I want to know  Because either the priest  Was  Was  Going south  On the little  Retarded child  Or he had  The little  Retarded child  Receiving  His form of communion  Or  He was slamming 
[02:31:00]  The back door  Or he had the  Little retarded child  Slamming the back door  Of the priest  So there's a lot of  Options there  And I don't think  They're  Very clear as to what  Was happening in the stall  Ask George  He might know  That's a busy bathroom  I had no idea  What he was doing  To the little retard  What do I care  All right  Jesus  And the priest  Dr. Zachary Smith  Young William O'Neill  Dr. Smith 
[02:31:30]  Remove your penis  From that boy  Spare me  The poisonous bobs  You bubble headed boobie  That's wrong  Yeah that is  Certainly is  You can't  Like you said  You can't blame  The Catholic priest  You can't blame them  Because they are  Kept from having  Any kind of sex  And it's a basic  Human drive  Right  Need it  Hey George  Do you have any  Thoughts on the mayor  Giuliani 
[02:32:00]  Yeah he's got a little  Honey on the side now  Yeah he's sick right  Yeah he's got  The prostate cancer  Well you know  He's a tight ass  He won't let you  Smoke a joint  In the park anymore  Him and the commissioner  Are both sick  Because they're sick  Anal retentive douchebags  The two of them  So they deserve  This cancer  Yes  Yeah  Oh my god  Wow George  I saw a Mr. Softy guy  Outside selling  Viagra 
[02:32:30]  Did you get that  Yeah we got that  Steve what's up  Oh and hey  Hey  Yes I'd like to  Speak to George  I have a question  Yes sir  Hey George  What do you think  Of female puppets  Like Lamb Chop  What would you do  With her  Put her on a gyro  A gyro  That big wad of meat  That spins around  Just slice it off  Yeah yeah yeah  Do you guys know  Ow ow you're hurting me  You're hurting me  Ow  Stop it  Sherry  Sherry's dead 
[02:33:00]  Now the sock  Just lays there  What were you going  To say Otto  Or was it George  Do you have any idea  How moronic  Your listeners are  Have you ever seen  The people that  Listen to the show  Yeah a lot of them  Came to the last show  Right  Oh man yeah  They're our listeners  We love them  Toothless  Drunken white trash  Oh and I roll  Come on  They're all our pals  They supported you 
[02:33:30]  They went out  And saw you George  Yes  Yes they did  And they might be there  Tonight at Rascals  Ocean Township  Every drunken one of them  Eight o'clock show  It's great how Otto  It's radio but he still  Works the mouth  Of the puppet  You guys are just  Grown up children  I've got to create  The illusion for you  Of course you do  Yeah  It would suck  If the puppet  Wasn't moving his mouth  Well we're pathetic too  Because we're just  Staring at George  Yeah  We're not looking at Otto  Last time we tried 
[02:34:00]  To give him a microphone  The puppet  We were convinced  He was real  Yeah  The priest is a retired  Priest Anthony  Yeah  He could have gotten  Some gash if he wanted  I don't know  I think even if you're  Retired you can't  Just start getting  Blayed if you're a priest  Did he lock the kids wheels  Don't say he was  In a wheelchair  He said he was  Learning disabled  Could be anything  Could be totally normal  Aside from maybe dyslexia  If he's learning disabled  Doesn't say  The priest was banging  A profoundly retarded  Mongoloid  Yeah  For the love of God 
[02:34:30]  Is that the proper term  Mongoloid  I think that's like  The 50's term  It's like when they were  Calling black people  Colored  Yeah  You know the  Mongoloid child  Down syndrome  That's it  Say more rules  ONA rules  Stas rules  Giuliani rules  I'm still convinced  He got that  Because he doesn't  Use the prostate enough  Yeah  You know  He wasn't getting laid 
[02:35:00]  Yeah  From his wife anyway  I guess  I think those girls  That he's seen with  Are just friends  You know  Why not  Yeah  I think if he was  Getting some  The prostate gets a workout  And it keeps things moving  Keeps the fluid  Through the pump  He's banging  You think  He's banging  Without a doubt  Big light bulb head  Between some thighs  That's right honey  You're getting some mayor  Right now  I'm the mayor of New York  Suck it  Suck it  Can you see that
