<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony "After O&A Live" show opened with somber news: the death of Ryan Dunn in a car accident.  The hosts, Sam Roberts, Eric, and Roland, reacted to this alongside the recent deaths of Clarence Clemons and Joel Silver.  They shared memories of past Jackass appearances, noting Dunn’s absence from their show.  The conversation moved to Clemons, focusing on his final performance with Lady Gaga and Bruce Springsteen's eulogy.  Roland's fondness for Blake Shelton was a recurring interjection throughout this section.  While Vanessa Williams was present in the building, she wasn't part of this segment.

A substantial portion of the broadcast was dedicated to remembering Tippy Tom, a deceased homeless regular.  A previously recorded segment was aired, showcasing a comedic, albeit bizarre, “prostate exam” performed on an inebriated Tippy Tom by Dr. Steve. This highlighted Tippy Tom’s characteristically eccentric and intoxicated demeanor.  The show also included discussion of a prior on-air dispute between E-Rock and Steve Sterniolo.

Later, Anthony angrily called in, upset about Tippy Tom having been allowed to sit in his chair and tamper with the studio equipment during his absence.  The show concluded with continued tributes to Tippy Tom and Ryan Dunn, speculation regarding Ron and Fez's absence from their own show, and a promise to return the following day.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  And now, the Opie and Anthony show  continues. This is  After O&A Live. Here's your  host, Sam Roberts.  That's what it is. After Opie and Anthony  Live. I don't  know if everybody heard. I just got this.  People just started tweeting this in. I guess  news just broke. Roland's here.  Eric's here. I just saw Troy walking back.  He's a Pennsylvania guy.  Apparently, Ryan Dunn died.  Did you hear about this, Eric?  No, I didn't hear that at all. 
[00:00:30]  Ask Troy. Is Troy in there with you?  Yeah. Did you hear?  No, we just found out, too.  Yeah, this is breaking, I guess.  TMZ is reporting  Jackass star  Ryan Dunn died in a car crash  in Pennsylvania early this morning.  Jesus Christ.  Was he trying to make it to Troy's  DJ gig? I don't even know what that means.  Ryan Dunn was  the guy from the Jackass movie who,  as he cited in this TMZ article, 
[00:01:00]  famously shoving a toy car  into his rectum  in the first movie  in 2002.  Yeah, Jesus Christ.  I guess Ryan Dunn is dead.  Death three.  Why? Who's the other?  Clarence,  Joel Silver,  I believe,  and then Ryan Dunn.  Who's Joel Silver?  What is the producer?  Oh.  He died yesterday,  so that's three.  You know, we did kind of break  the Clarence Clemens news  on here last week.  Remember?  It was like,  I said he was dead already.  Yeah, so.  Management tried to shut me down,  but I broke it.  No, but I guess, 
[00:01:30]  well, that sucks.  I mean,  I don't even know what to say.  Eric?  His last appearance  probably was him and Steve-O  on Minute to Win It.  Yeah, he was just on  Minute to Win It with Steve-O.  Yeah.  They were doing something  for Steve-O's,  I guess his sister  has a charity or something?  Yeah.  Yeah, he was just on  like the day before  Steve-O came in here  last week or two weeks ago.  Ryan Dunn was on  Minute to Win It with him.  He's never done this show,  has he?  I don't know.  Maybe next time 
[00:02:00]  because we got a group  of them last time.  He might have been one of the,  yeah, because of the big guy.  I think it was him,  but he hadn't talked,  I believe it was like four of them  we got.  That was a long time ago  next time.  I think Brian Novak  or whatever his name is  came in with Bam.  The Dudesons were in here.  No, but there was like  the first Jackass movie  there was like four of them  came in,  but I'm not sure,  I don't remember which four.  Do you remember Eric?  No, that doesn't sound  familiar at all.  Yeah, I don't think  Ryan Dunn ever did the show.  Knoxville, obviously, 
[00:02:30]  Steve-O.  I think Brian Novak did,  not him.  Bam, Novak.  Oh.  Well, I mean,  and Roland was just saying too,  it sucks that like  he spent his life  doing these insane stunts  and then it seems like  it was just a regular car accident.  I mean, obviously,  we don't have any details yet.  This literally broke  during the commercial break,  so Brian Dunn is dead  from Jackass.  Have you found anything, Eric?  No, I'm looking.  I'm not seeing anything  on it.  I don't think he ever did the show. 
[00:03:00]  I can't.  No, I don't think so at all.  Yeah, I don't think he did.  Well, and he never will,  which is a shame.  So we'll dedicate this  to Ryan Dunn.  Everybody's dying.  How are you dealing  with Clarence Clemens?  It's sad.  As a member of the  E Street Army.  It's sad, though.  Seeing the big man die.  Is E Street Radio  doing some stuff for him?  I think they did it last night.  Dave Marsh did.  But I haven't heard anything today.  I haven't listened  to E Street Radio today.  I will.  Are you just trying not to?  He was in Lady Gaga's 
[00:03:30]  music video, wasn't he?  Was that the last?  The last one was  that American Idol  performed with Lady Gaga.  And he was just in the video  for it that came out  like last week.  Yeah.  She's the big Bruce fan.  So was that the last  performance he did?  Yep.  With Gaga on American Idol.  That's the way  his legacy ends.  Oh my God.  How do you feel about that  as a Bruce fan?  Well, if you go back  to the last night  of the tour.  Yeah.  Bruce did Growing Up,  but he usually  doesn't do a speech,  but he did a long speech  about Clarence,  how they first met. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, so he kind of  knew it was the end?  At least of him  touring in the band.  It was weird, though.  Now you watch it,  you see him talking about it.  Because they met in 71.  Mm-hmm.  So, and they talked about it.  30, 40 years.  40 years now.  40 years, yeah.  That's all he did  was play an Easter band  for 40 years.  Jesus.  Well, do you think  that Bruce knew  that was his last time  on stage with him?  I don't know.  Like, is that why  he was doing the speech?  I don't know.  Because you said  he was sitting down.  Obviously, people knew  he was sick.  Yeah, they said he was sick  on and off, so.  Not that anybody thought 
[00:04:30]  he was going to die,  but that he was too sick  to regularly.  No, but he thought that  he needed this could be  like the last.  The end of the run.  Yeah.  How are you feeling  about the, uh...  That's why Bruce said  if you can go see them,  go see them now  during the tour.  So I went 85 times.  Yeah, I mean,  you've seen him before, too.  I said, I will go Bruce.  Um, and is his nephew now?  Who'd you say was...  Jake Clemens.  That's Clemens' nephew?  Do you think he's going  to be able to maintain  this legacy?  He's really good.  He opened up for the frames  when I saw him.  And he was good?  Really good.  But good enough to... 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, it's like,  it's really creepy  how he plays.  He's really...  Because there aren't  that many saxophone players.  No, you play saxophone,  drones, and piano.  Jeez, people can't  stick to one instrument.  Why not perfect that one?  Multi-talented.  There's a lot of stuff  going on today, Roland.  People are feedbacking in now  saying Ryan Dunn is dead.  Car accident.  Yeah.  You gotta listen...  Turn on your radio  if you're gonna feedback in.  I just said that.  Eric, don't you have  any control over this?  Not over the feedback.  That's too bad.  I wish we could turn it off. 
[00:05:30]  Well, I mean,  I guess we could just  literally click out the window  and that would be  the end of feedback,  wouldn't it?  I'm looking through  some notes here and stuff.  I guess Don Vito  and Ryan Dunn  were supposed to be  on the show  back in September of 2005.  Oh.  But I think  Don Vito was missing.  So they did a no-show.  Oh, so maybe  that's where you're  confused Roland.  Maybe you booked him  and they just didn't  show up.  Bastard.  Well,  now you'll never have  a chance to make good on that.  Oh, well.  Although Don Vito 
[00:06:00]  could still come in.  Vanessa Williams is here.  Yeah.  I just walked by it  when I was going  to the bathroom.  I saw her.  What about putting her  on the after show?  I, I, I'll ask.  You don't think  it's going to happen.  Listen.  For her,  you probably need  a little bit more  of the time.  I wanted to,  yeah, another,  another feedbacker  says Abe Vigoda  outlives Ryan Dunn.  How does Abe Vigoda  outlive all these people?  He stays home  and does nothing.  That's the,  that's the trick, huh?  That's the trick, huh?  That's the trick, huh?  That's the trick, huh?  You're not going to  get in a car accident  if you don't get in a car.  Yeah. 
[00:06:30]  That's the,  that's the lesson  we learned from  Ryan Dunn's life.  Like the country guy,  Blake Shelton,  he doesn't drive in LA.  He refuses to.  What is it with  your fascinating,  Roland?  I love Blake Shelton.  Enough with Blake Shelton.  I follow you on Twitter,  Rolando's 99.  It's Roland,  Roland,  O-S,  99.  And all you do  is tweet.  I tweet.  About Blake Shelton  from The Voice.  Yes.  Why?  He's a great singer.  I enjoy him.  That's,  has he,  he's become like  your new obsession?  Not obsession. 
[00:07:00]  I just tweet.  A lot about  Blake Shelton, though.  The new album  comes out July 15th.  Go buy it.  You don't like  the other people  on The Voice?  I do.  But they're not  Blake Shelton.  Not Blake Shelton.  Are you a country music guy?  I was born in Austin.  Yes.  So you're,  I didn't know  you were born in Austin.  Yeah.  So you got  country music roots.  I've seen tons  of country concerts.  You like them?  Yes.  Still to this day?  Yeah,  I saw Tim McGraw,  Kenny Chesney,  Garth Brooks,  Tim McBride.  Where did you see  Garth Brooks?  Did you go to  the Central Park?  No, no,  I went to Vegas in LA. 
[00:07:30]  How is he?  In Texas.  Really good.  He's good,  live, right?  A lot of hits,  that guy.  Tons of hits.  A lot of hits,  Garth Brooks.  He's supposed to come back  for a few shows.  My parents raised me  on country music.  I know a thing or two.  Yeah.  I mean,  not,  you know,  but a thing or two.  Yeah.  Back when New York  used to have a country music station.  It's a country country.  That's when people are like,  you like country?  Yes.  Yeah,  let it go,  right?  Yeah.  I just think it's funny  that you tweet about  Blake Shelton nonstop.  I'm like,  what's his connection?  Like,  is he trying to get  this guy booked  on the show?  He's nodding. 
[00:08:00]  We had a,  it was a very interesting  Opie and Anthony show today.  Eric,  you caught a lot of heat today  out of seemingly nowhere.  Surprise.  Did you feel that,  what happened with you?  They call them fat.  Yeah,  I know.  It hurts.  Why today was it,  did you go back in the barrel  out of nowhere?  Because it's easy.  Is that all it was?  They were just looking  for the easy out?  I don't think it was,  they were looking for the easy out.  They were going somewhere.  And then,  yeah,  Steve Sterniolo  just had to come in 
[00:08:30]  and ruin everything.  Okay,  so you think this was Sterniolo,  like,  they gave Sterniolo a mic  and he decided,  Sterniola,  and he decided that,  he was going to take  full advantage of the situation  and shit on E-Rock  because it was a safe thing  to do in the room?  Yes.  You think that is,  Roland?  Eric?  I think it was approval  of everybody.  What do you think, Eric?  Fuck him,  who cares?  You don't even give a shit enough.  No.  You don't give a shit enough  to have an opinion about him.  No,  but I was laughing  if you scroll down a page or two  on the feedback there.  I guess somebody flipped over  when I said,  why aren't you doing your own show? 
[00:09:00]  And he said,  he was listening to the other channel  and then a bit ended  and it was like dead air  for about a minute.  So he's not a good employee.  I guess not.  Well,  that is what it is.  That's called the Sterniola.  That's his mark.  Oh,  I see.  But there was a lot,  there ended up being a lot  of inside stuff today on the show.  There was,  you know,  the E-Rock,  Troy,  Steve Sterniola debacle.  Yeah,  Troy got vicious,  but he doesn't mind  getting vicious in there.  There was,  you know,  a lot of Father's Day talk.  Jess ended up on the phone. 
[00:09:30]  We were talking about  special delivery.  So instead,  I mean,  all the behind the scenes stuff  that usually happens on this show  happened on Opie and Anthony today.  So instead,  I figured we would celebrate  something that happened  this day in ONA history.  If you listened to the whole show,  you heard a little snippet of it.  And I wanted to play two parts,  if we have time for it,  because it's also honoring the memory  of someone who is no longer with us.  And that's not Clarence Clemens.  What?  You're playing two clips?  And that's not, 
[00:10:00]  well,  we'll see if I have time for both of them.  Let's be honest.  Yeah.  That's not Clarence Clemens.  It's not even Ryan Dunn.  As we think about all the people  that we've lost recently,  our minds always go back  to a legend on the Opie and Anthony show.  Possibly the most valuable member  in the on-air history of this program.  Steve is still alive?  No, no, no.  That's obviously not who I'm talking about.  Of course, Roland.  Tippy Tom?  Tippy Tom.  You're exactly right.  The homeless guy,  I mean,  Tippy Tom was the type of guy 
[00:10:30]  who made it so that  management and everybody around us  wanted us to get more homeless people.  Get more homeless people,  get more homeless people  because nobody understood  that Tippy Tom was a one in a million.  It wasn't just that he was homeless.  It was,  he was a natural,  gifted,  born entertainer.  And there was nothing  more to it than that.  I mean,  there was nobody  who could just come in here,  adapt to any situation,  take control of the room,  and be terribly intoxicated 
[00:11:00]  and not have a home  and not have a home  the way Tippy Tom could.  Well,  we had a few beers  before he went on.  Yeah,  you'd have to give him a few beers.  He would spend some time  in the green room  drinking before he went on the air.  But once you got that sauce in him,  there was no stopping him.  And then I love,  after he was done performing,  we'd kind of tuck him  into the couch  in the back of the studio  and there he would sleep.  Yeah,  just let him sleep  until Ron and Fez come on.  That was back in the old days  of the 57th Street studio.  But one year ago today,  no,  not one year ago,  three years ago,  2008, 
[00:11:30]  of course,  one year ago today  he was dead still.  But he's dead now.  We found him  a couple years ago.  The old man hit his head  and he didn't wake up again.  I mean,  that's the life  of a homeless guy,  man.  It's just one night  you get drunk  and you don't wake up  in the morning.  And if it wasn't  for this show,  nobody would even  realize he was gone.  He would just be  another nameless corpse  in the morgue.  That's life, people.  I hate to depress you,  but that's what  you're dealing with  out there.  Damn you made me sad.  Unless 
[00:12:00]  you can make a name  for yourself  the way Tippy Tom did  and your work,  your recorded works  can live on  throughout history.  This is just  one of those moments  because three years  ago today,  Tippy Tom was in studio  as was our pal  Dr. Steve  of Weird Medicine fame.  Dr. Steve's Weird  Medicine show  is on Saturday night  after special delivery,  of course.  So Tippy Tom was in  and we gave him  a prostate exam.  We cared about  the guy's health 
[00:12:30]  and we wanted to make  sure he was doing well.  You might have heard  a snippet of this  earlier on in today's show.  We wanted to play  the entire thing  for you  because we like you.  We want to share  things with you  and that's what we're doing.  This is Tippy Tom  and the homeless  prostate exam  courtesy of our pal  Dr. Steve  and for whoever  is feedbacking in now,  newsflash Ryan Dunn  is dead.  Listen from the beginning  of the show.  We've talked about it already.  Yeah?  Ryan Dunn just died.  I know that! 
[00:13:00]  I know that.  So here it is.  Keith Anderson is sad.  Another guy  who has passed away.  Tippy Tom  and the homeless  prostate exam  on After Opie  and Anthony Live.  After O&A Live.  Alright, uh...  Alright, Tippy Tom,  I want to talk.  Alright, Tippy, yeah.  I'm going to sit down now.  Tippy.  Like this on the...  Why are the doctors  putting on all sorts of  fucking biohazard gear?  I know.  Do you have a question  for me, please?  Hold on, yeah. 
[00:13:30]  When was the last time  you saw a doctor,  Tippy Tom?  About a thousand years ago.  When I was growing up.  Yeah.  And then, um...  Yeah, but that was about it.  Yeah.  I don't go to doctors  and I don't like them.  Oh.  Because they'll find out  things that are wrong  with you that aren't.  Tom, I've got to ask you something.  So I'm really not happy  with doctors.  Have you been drilling  for oil?  How much oil do I drink?  No, have you been drilling  for oil?  You have fucking hands  like,  I'm drilling for oil?  Right. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, I do that all the time.  Yeah.  So, um...  What else do you want to hear?  Tippy Tom,  the doctor's going to  examine you now  so you have to  take your clothes off.  Yeah.  Oh, see my body?  Yeah, you've got to  take your clothes off.  Again, take your clothes off.  Well...  Step out in front of the crowd.  That's going to cost  them some money.  Well, is that right over here?  That's going to cost...  No, they said no.  No, no, they didn't need no.  Go ahead.  Want some money?  Come on.  Well, yeah.  No, I'm on our radio.  Right here. 
[00:14:30]  This is the...  Whoa!  What are you doing?  Ladies and gentlemen,  this is the charity portion  of the Opie and Anthony show  where we pass around  a basket like we're in church.  What do I do?  Give.  Give to the homeless.  Give to the homeless.  Take my clothes off.  Yeah, be sexy.  Take your clothes off  and throw them like a stripper.  Wait a second.  All right, take your clothes off, Tom.  For your...  Tom, for your exam,  take your clothes off.  Take your clothes off.  Throw your money, ladies and gentlemen. 
[00:15:00]  Throw your money.  I'm not taking on my clothes off.  You've got to take it off  for your exam.  Get your pants.  Well, where's the doctor at?  He's right there.  Look, that's the doctor.  All right, all right.  Come on, come on.  Just...  All right.  What are we doing?  We're standing here.  Dr. Steve's keeping...  Dr. Steve's keeping it very professional.  He originally said  Tom doesn't have to take all...  Get your hog away from me.  How is his penis next day?  Don't sprinkle them by me, E-Rock. 
[00:15:30]  Jimmy was three feet  from Jimmy's penis.  All right, get over here.  Tom, we're...  Yeah, I'm getting over here.  Tom, we're going to examine you.  Dr. Steve is a real doctor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tom and I talked before the show.  Yeah.  All right.  And he's cool with doing this on the air.  Am I sitting down or standing up?  No, we'll let you stand up here.  You got to take your jacket off that time.  Take your jacket off that time.  Take your jacket off that time.  Take your jacket off that time, please.  Jimmy Tom is standing up right now.  All right.  Because I'm going to get an exam.  Yes.  To see if I'm okay.  But he hasn't been to the doctor in a long time,  and we've arranged for someone  at the Ryan Center uptown 
[00:16:00]  to see him after the show  if we find anything.  Right.  Okay.  Yeah, because, you know,  my pancreas is giving out.  Not your liver?  Let's see.  Something else is breaking down.  And plus, I stubbed my toe.  And that's what bothers me the most.  So, can you fix the toe?  Sure.  Absolutely.  Let's see your feet, Tom.  Yeah, let's see them.  By the way,  who's working the pal talk camera? 
[00:16:30]  No, I stink the place up.  No one's working the pal talk camera.  I got my new socks on.  Yeah.  Yeah, Dad, you know how to do that?  And I have to keep them on.  My doctor told me  because I stubbed my toe.  All right, Dr. Steve is listening to his heart.  Steve, you've got to give us commentary, honestly.  I'm just listening to his heart,  and it actually sounds pretty darn good.  You can take this working, huh?  Yep.  Oh, that's good. 
[00:17:00]  That's good.  Take a deep breath for me.  Take a deep breath.  Oh, boy.  Emphysema for everyone.  Casually.  I mostly smoke other things.  I'm just going to feel it.  I smoke corn silk.  Corn silk?  How is his lungs?  Where do you get that in the city?  How is his lungs?  They get in a cornfield in Jersey.  What do you think you're going to get it at?  All right.  They got it in Long Island, too. 
[00:17:30]  Steve?  Okay.  Now, Tom, you know your liver's a little enlarged.  I think my liver is a little enlarged.  Oh, that's not a...  Can I see your...  Can I see your...  What you're feeling, Steve, is the help me sign.  The liver's holding up.  Ankle no good.  Ankle no good.  Yeah, this is where it gets serious.  Well, this one's not too bad.  Go, Tom.  No, this went worse. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, Dr. Steve is looking at...  Well, I got it coming up.  Tipping Tom's ankles.  They're not too bad.  I can still walk.  Yeah.  So, obviously, everything's...  Have they been swollen like that for a long time?  Dr. Steve's not happy.  Well, they go up and down, you know.  Yeah.  You know, some days up, some days down.  Dr. Steve, it's been about a year that I've seen it like that, yeah.  Well, and...  Do you get short of breath when you lay down?  No.  Okay.  All right.  What do you think that means, this ankle?  Fuck!  When you have big ankles, it can be from a lot of things, but it's always fluid, and 
[00:18:30]  it's just the question is where...  Edemia?  Edema, yeah.  Edema, I mean?  Yeah, where is the fluid coming from?  Now, in his case, what this really looks like is a thing called venous stasis, which  is just, it's from gravity pulling on the veins in the legs.  Yeah, gravity!  I did not know that!  And fluid...  Now I know!  Fluid leaks out from the veins, and we'll talk about that after the show, but if you 
[00:19:00]  elevate your legs when you're laying down, that'll actually help that.  That is true.  Yes.  Elevate them.  That's what I do!  Yep.  Oh, good.  Yeah, but I lay on concrete.  It helps my back, too, because I got a bad back.  Okay.  So I lay on a flat surface and elevate my dukes, my feet, and that way there, the blood circulation  run right, so, because when I wake up, if I go to sleep, if I'm lucky, then I wake up, 
[00:19:30]  or get up when I'm done laying down, so I can walk.  You spend most of the day on your feet?  Because I like to walk around town!  Yeah!  Now, the thing that I'd like to do next is what we talked about earlier, is to check  your prostate and check your rear end...  My prostate, Glenn?  Yep.  Well, that might be a job.  You want to go up my ass?  Yep.  What we'll do is we'll have you drop your drawers, and I'll have you bend over the table, and we'll 
[00:20:00]  bring up a...  Right here?  Yep, we'll bring up a sheet so that nobody can see you.  So something...  A camera?  No, and I'll just use my finger, and we'll just test you for blood, and we'll check out  your prostate gland.  Check the, uh...  So you can put the finger up the ass, huh?  Yeah.  Is that okay?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Will you rotate it a little bit?  I want to enjoy this process!  I don't have a free! 
[00:20:30]  See, I just let the material be funny.  I don't have to try to be funny.  That's fucking great.  That's what I mean.  Will you rotate it a little bit?  Well, if you can put a finger up my ass, I want it to feel good.  And that's the way it is.  All right, let's get the sheet off for...  If it don't feel good, I'll be mad.  You okay with doing this?  Well, when are we going to do this job?  Right now.  Where?  Right here?  Yep.  In front of everybody? 
[00:21:00]  Yep.  They'll bring the sheet up.  Right here?  The sheet's up.  No one can see you, except us.  The figure's going in the ass!  If it's okay with you?  In front of everybody?  There's only a matter of time.  Yeah, just...  Wow!  You're just naked in front of everybody.  Yeah.  Tom, you bend forward and he checks you.  Yeah, that's all.  You're just squeaky.  Yeah, but suppose they like my ass.  I'm golden buns.  And they may like me.  That's why we gotta check out...  The golden buns don't want to have too many people on me.  We're checking out...  And I can only handle a few at a time. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  We're checking out golden buns for you.  It'll just be me.  Yeah.  And this is my partner, PA John.  We met before.  Oh, another doctor.  Yes, sir.  Yeah!  Yeah!  Good!  I got two doctors.  That's right.  And I'm happy.  You ready?  All right.  How are we gonna do this?  You just drop your drawers and bend over to the table?  Just kind of touch your ankle.  Just kind of bend over?  You gonna do this?  Yep.  Yeah.  All right.  Everybody, I'm gonna get checked out.  Let me see what happens here.  By the way, I gotta remind people, Dr. Steve got him a real checkup for later on today. 
[00:22:00]  Dr. Steve is behind.  Come on!  Get this asshole out!  Tom, you want to tell us what's going on?  Ow!  It hurts!  You haven't even started yet.  Yeah, come on, Tom.  All right.  Let's listen to Tom.  I'm up here now.  Come on, man.  Get ready.  Ow!  All right.  Here we go.  Ow!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh! 
[00:22:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  It's all the time!  Wow.  It's like...  Your prostate is a normal size.  Oh, that's good news.  You don't have anything abnormal on it at all, and we're checking you for blood right now.  Oh, you gotta pull some blood out of me, man.  No, no, no.  We're checking what we got out of your rear end for blood.  Oh, you get it in there?  It's a miracle!  Yeah! 
[00:23:00]  Yeah!  Miracles do happen!  I love that.  What do you have to say, Tippi Tom?  What do you think, Tippi Tom?  Well, I'll say I'm very happy that my doctors are here.  And I'm very happy that I got a clear, clean bill of health.  Yeah.  And that's it.  And so what I got to say is that thank you for the medical.  How much is the bill?  After ONA Live.  The only thing good about being Ryan Dunn right now, who we just found out passed away, 
[00:23:30]  is that he gets to hang out with Tippi Tom somewhere.  We can only hope.  I mean, that's where I hope I'm going, right to Tippi Tom's place.  Because we're just going to hang out and just chill.  Tippi Tom.  I mean, if you didn't laugh at that, I don't know what's wrong with you.  Roland, you miss Tippi Tom, don't you?  Yeah, he's funny.  That's what I thought.  He made me laugh when he drank the beers.  He goes, I'm going to get drunk.  That's a very good impression.  And I said one beer.  I go, no, I can't drink.  He goes, you're a pussy. 
[00:24:00]  A whole bunch of stuff was happening today.  They finally got to my DNA test today.  What was the results?  Well, Anthony determined they were inconclusive.  Because it basically just said I was 1% or less of every white race,  from every white country, and then like half a percent Puerto Rican.  So I don't know where any of it comes from.  Wait a minute.  So you, Mars, are brothers?  Well, Mars came in here to celebrate when he heard that news, yeah.  Of course, he comes in here and celebrates anything.  Yeah, it doesn't matter. 
[00:24:30]  As long as he doesn't have to.  Break time!  Oh, wow.  So you're saying as long as he doesn't have to work, he'll come in to celebrate.  Or he'll sit in the couch here and go, you have to wake him up.  Hey, Mars, what's up?  Wow.  You're brutal, Roland.  I don't think I have any Hispanic blood in me whatsoever.  So I think that, yes.  Well, you do.  You're passive and lazy, so you might.  How am I lazy?  I'm just saying.  What does that mean?  That you made it up?  No.  Yes.  I mean, I just think I may stick with Anthony.  And the DNA test, after all this time, was probably inconclusive. 
[00:25:00]  Eric, did you have any opinions on that?  I don't think we examined it thoroughly enough.  The paperwork, or you just don't think the test was done well?  The paperwork for it.  I think they're misreading something.  Why?  Because there was a couple other levels that we never really went through.  Yeah, I don't think any of us really understood the paperwork.  Like, I didn't get it.  Well, that's why you were supposed to call the guy to walk you through.  Yeah, we didn't want to do all that.  Oh.  So, I mean, we just figured we'd figure it out. 
[00:25:30]  And what we figured out was inconclusive.  So to any of you guys, so somebody on Twitter was saying they didn't want to get out of their car  because they wanted to hear the results.  Hopefully you got out of your car because it really was a buzz through.  I don't think it's shit during that segment.  It had to go so bad.  Yeah, I mean, the shit was probably better because it was more concrete.  It was fantastic.  Actually, I hope not.  I hope there's a little more moisture to it than that.  It was fantastic.  While we still have a little bit of time, let's continue to celebrate the life of Tippy Tom.  You know, we did enough behind the scenes on the regular show today 
[00:26:00]  that we'll celebrate some show content on the after show  and the life of Tippy Tom and, yes, Coke Logic.  I'm reading your feedback.  That cardboard box in the sky.  Roland should be hosting this show.  You suck.  Okay, well, that's a different person feedback.  I love Coke Logic.  Coke Logic didn't feedback the second part.  It doesn't matter.  I still love Coke Logic.  Well, I love Coke Logic, too.  But, Tippy Tom, it was the same day.  Actually, this happened before the prostate exam happened. 
[00:26:30]  Ant had left for the day.  He had to catch a flight.  He had to go somewhere.  I don't know.  He took over.  And, yeah, Tippy Tom decided that, well, we helped him, I guess.  I hope he was coaxing him and Jim was, too.  That since Ant is a bit of a germaphobe,  a good idea would be if Tippy Tom sat in his chair and touched all his things.  Eric, didn't Ant freak out when an intern was playing with his toys?  Yeah, we've had a couple interns that would pick up the megaphone, mostly, 
[00:27:00]  and pretend to be Anthony.  So we, either he destroyed them on the air or we wound up throwing stuff out.  And this was another case of throwing everything out, even stuff he didn't touch.  So you can only imagine, if he doesn't like an intern touching it, how he felt about a homeless man like Tippy Tom.  And let me tell you something.  We've had a lot of homeless men up here.  Tippy Tom probably smelled worse than any of them combined.  I mean, there was nobody who smelled as bad or caused as many smiles as Tippy Tom. 
[00:27:30]  I just got Twitter.  If you want to memorialize Ryan Dunn, you go see Troy Spinn in Pennsylvania this weekend.  That's a terrible plug.  It was bad timing and it didn't even have any details.  I totally forgot it.  Yeah.  Maybe you should think your thoughts through before you really get to it.  Yeah, I was going to sit back here.  And just enjoy the Tippy Tom?  Yeah.  Yeah, why don't you take a breather, Roland?  You're stressing yourself.  It's okay.  This is Tippy Tom taking over Ant's chair, as I'm sure many of you have dreamed that you could too, 
[00:28:00]  right here on After Opie and Anthony Live.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  We've got a huge crowd here at XM today.  The lovely Brie Olsen has joined the festivity.  She's sitting at the big table here.  We've got Dr. Steve at the table.  We've got Tippy Tom wandering around out there and bothering people.  Hold on.  That mic's not on.  Why does the mic work sometimes and then other times it doesn't? 
[00:28:30]  Well, what is it that you're trying to say?  I was just saying hi to you, Tippy.  Oh!  You're saying hello?  Yeah.  Well, hello to you, too.  All right.  I got an idea, Tippy.  How you doing?  I got this idea.  It might be a little crazy.  I don't know.  But Anthony had to leave the show early today.  He's going down to the Bahamas with Joe Mipolini.  Oh, that's good news!  Why don't you come on in here, Tippy?  Come on in, Tippy.  Come on in. 
[00:29:00]  Come on in.  Anthony's chair.  Anthony's chair.  Tippy.  He's a man.  Tippy, I want you.  All right.  That's that damn good news.  This is great news.  I want you to sit.  I'm so damn happy.  I want you to sit in Anthony's chair.  In a big, comfy chair.  Make yourself comfortable, Tippy.  I feel like talking.  Let's hear it for Tippy Tom sitting in Anthony's chair.  Yeah.  There you go.  There you go.  It's the Tippy.  I'll clean up this for you. 
[00:29:30]  Tippy.  It's the Opie and Tippy Tom show.  Beautiful.  Here you go.  There's your mic.  Hey, what can try out some of your quarts?  Yeah, Tippy.  Hey, it's my new song.  Wait, play that whistle for everybody.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'm going to get it right.  There you go.  There you go. 
[00:30:00]  Tippy Tom.  Sitting in Anthony's seat.  Why don't you try some of the other stuff out for me?  Let's play this thing here.  You are a song.  What do you think?  What do you think of the horn there, Tippy?  I can play anything like you got.  Yeah.  I'm a musician.  Why don't you try some of the buttons over there? 
[00:30:30]  Just push some of the buttons over there.  What button do you want to put?  Whatever one you want.  It's you, Tom.  I won't kill Tom.  Is that enough?  No.  Keep going.  I got lower up the door.  Five.  Two.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Tom.  One at a time.  I'm trying to do it.  I want two at a time.  I'll be three.  Four.  Let me tell you something, Mike.  Oh, you got second.  As far as I go, I'll take it.  I don't care how many Dago, Gennie, Wolf, Reese, Paul, Bum, Bum, Bum, Bum. 
[00:31:00]  I don't know what it is.  It's in the hole.  No, no.  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  It's in the hole.  Hey, try the bell there, Tom.  Try the bell.  Hold on.  How come Tom doesn't have headphones on?  Oh, Tom, do you have headphones on?  He was having a spray.  Tom should put those headphones on.  He don't need spray. 
[00:31:30]  Put the headphones on.  I got to talk to somebody.  All right.  Why don't you put the headphones on?  There you go.  Oh, what's in here?  Yeah, try that.  Try blowing into that.  Yeah, that's funny.  There you go.  Oh, look.  It's Anthony on line three.  Hey, wait, Tom.  Tom.  Take this next call through the bullhorn.  Hey, Tom.  I like the bullhorn.  Yeah, give him the bullhorn.  Let's talk.  Here, try the bullhorn out there, Tom.  Well, yeah. 
[00:32:00]  Wait, over there.  Right there.  That's a goddamn good idea.  Right here.  I know that.  What I'm saying is this.  Push the button, Tom.  Here we go.  Yeah, guys.  Push it in and talk.  All right.  Now, what I'm saying is that I like the bullhorn, and I don't see no bullhorns around here.  There's no buffalo over here either.  But, you know, I'm tired of all this New York City. 
[00:32:30]  Hey, Tom.  No buffalo.  Tom, Tom, Tom, Tom.  What?  Focus, focus.  Grab the mic.  Put the bullhorn down.  Now, take the next call for us, okay?  All right.  Who's calling?  No, just go, hi, who's this?  Go ahead.  Say it.  Hi, who's this?  Hi, who's this?  Get that animal out of my house.  No.  The animal's not here now. 
[00:33:00]  I will not.  I will not use any of those things again.  I want everything disinfected.  The entire side of the studio.  And I will not sit in that chair.  I will buy it.  You're out of business now, buddy.  You're tired.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[00:33:30]  What I don't understand is why you ain't playing no rock and roll around.  I knew this was going to happen, Phil.  I knew it.  The second I left, I'm like, why haven't they sat him in my seat?  I know these dumb bags are going to do that.  He's having a ball over there.  He's touching everything.  Well, yeah.  Tom, don't put your mic.  Your mouth is not far enough.  You have to move him closer to the microphone.  Yeah, you've got to get closer to the mic so he can hear you.  Get closer to the mic, Tom.  He can't hear you.  I got the headphones on.  Yeah, but get closer to the mic.  His lips are touching.  Now I know everything I can't use anymore. 
[00:34:00]  The mic, I'm taking the mic off and throwing it in the garbage.  Is your name Mike?  Jesus Christ.  Where you been, Mike?  I'm here in fucking think-bomb.  You might think about getting rid of the chair, too.  You started pissing me off, Mike.  Yeah, the chair is going to be gone.  Yeah.  Why don't you tell me?  I got pissed off.  I turned into the Hulk.  And I swear to God.  Yeah.  I will come after you.  He has turned into the Hulk.  Look at his legs are green. 
[00:34:30]  All right.  Well, have fun with Tippi Tom.  I'm going to go to the Bahamas.  Hey, Tom.  Take away everything in that studio.  Can I go?  You want to go to the Bahamas with me?  Yeah.  Why not?  Wouldn't that be great?  I could just ditch him there and have him swim back.  And you get to enjoy my company.  Hey, Tom.  It's hard to...  It's hard to...  What? 
[00:35:00]  You have to adjust the Paltor cameras with that handle right there.  Because I want to...  Nobody gets me.  Jesus.  Wait a minute.  Let my spray alone.  No, get rid of that.  He's even touching the scent things.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  Oh, what's this for here?  You get nothing.  You lose.  Good day, sir.  Somehow his sound effects are very appropriate.  Hey, man.  That was Rocky Pitcher Horror Show.  Well, have fun with that stinky motherfucker. 
[00:35:30]  I got to go.  Where are you going?  And I knew this was going to happen.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Go fuck yourself.  Thank you.  Yeah.  There you go.  There's Anthony on his way to the Bahamas.  That's not nice.  Yeah.  That was very uncalled for.  Yeah, that was very wrong of you to hurt my feelings, man.  I actually feel sorry for Ronnie because Ronnie has to sit in that seat at noon today. 
[00:36:00]  All right, Tippy.  Why don't you go get a beer?  There you go.  There's...  Well, yeah.  I want to get a beer.  Where the beer at?  Well, they're going to show you where the beer is.  Tippy Tom sitting in Anthony's seat.  I'm all hooked up here.  Yeah.  Get him over there to enjoy a beer.  Take my horn.  Yes.  Take the horn.  Tippy.  Have fun with it.  Oh, I got the beer here, man.  We have to sit over there.  Yeah, go ahead.  Go ahead.  Damn, I was having fun. 
[00:36:30]  After O&A Live.  Well, we were having fun listening.  Tippy Tom on After Opie and Anthony Live, our old homeless pal.  And boy, does everybody here miss him.  I mean, Danny misses him more than anyone because, I mean, Danny considered him like a true friend.  But, I mean, we all are somehow trying to get through our lives without Tippy Tom.  Damn, breaking news.  Yeah.  Ryan Dunn has passed away.  I know that, Eric.  Eric, you of all people should be listening. 
[00:37:00]  And now there's people feedbacking in breaking news.  Tippy Tom is dead.  Look, don't make light of the situation.  Eric, you of all people should realize that at the beginning of the show, I mentioned that Ryan Dunn had passed away.  It was just breaking on TMZ and all the other.  There was no way you knew at the beginning of the show.  That was 6 a.m.  It just happened.  The beginning of this show, After Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, this one.  Yes.  This is a show.  This is a show.  Oh.  And I just found out between the Opie and Anthony and After Opie and Anthony Live commercial break. 
[00:37:30]  That's when it broke.  Oh, boy.  Real quick.  I know.  Hotline.  Breaking news.  Blake Shelton's album comes out July 15th.  I know Roland's.  I know.  Eric, I know Roland's phone number now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, I knew it was him that time.  I heard some even more disturbing news that Ron and Fez are not coming back live at 11 o'clock.  No.  They may be live later in the day.  I don't know where anybody is. 
[00:38:00]  I don't know if Ron is left on another secret mission that he's not going to talk about.  I believe on Tuesday, tomorrow morning, they'll be back live at 11 a.m.  That's the word.  That's what we're hoping for.  But who knows?  Who knows what secret activities Ron Bennington has up his sleeve?  The only way you're going to find out is to stay tuned because Ron and Fez are coming up next.  We'll see you tomorrow with more Opie and Anthony and after Opie and Anthony Live. </pre>
