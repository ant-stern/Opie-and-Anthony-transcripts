<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony XM Satellite Radio broadcast began with Jim Norton's return from Hollywood, sparking a discussion about rudeness, fueled by Norton's recent appearance on a television segment about the topic.  They dissected various examples of inconsiderate behavior, particularly focusing on obnoxious parents and general societal decline in manners. Norton recounted his *Lucky Louie* (HBO) filming experiences.  Numerous listener calls followed, some offering their own tales of rudeness (including one about a disruptive child at a King Kong movie), some praising Norton's return, and others expressing opinions on Howard Stern.  One caller even proudly announced destroying their Sirius radio to switch to XM for Opie and Anthony.  A substantial portion of the show was devoted to listener-submitted remixes of Emily Stern's singing, many described as pornographic, alongside promotion of online videos featuring "Stalker Patty" and a mousetrap genital challenge.  The hosts also heavily promoted the grand opening of Opie's brother's restaurant, FH Riley's, in Huntington.

The discussion then shifted to FH Riley's opening weekend, with Opie noting a surprisingly high number of women in attendance despite anticipating a mostly male crowd due to their show's promotion.  Callers confirmed the positive atmosphere and predicted it becoming an O&A hangout. Opie mentioned his brothers and brother-in-law would be celebrity bartenders.  They debated Long Island traffic woes and an invitation to participate in the Huntington St. Patrick's Day parade (rejected unless they were named co-Grand Marshals), speculating humorously on the bar's potential transformations into a biker bar or a gay bar, and how to deter bikers.  Several callers shared their experiences, including one mentioning a magician father-in-law performing at the bar.

The show then featured a listener, "Rob," recounting a story about recovering a bullet after a military encounter in Honduras, a tale met with skepticism and challenges from both callers and hosts.  The veracity of his story remained unresolved, but the hosts joked about the various aspects of his narrative, including his marijuana use (obtained from another listener at the bar) and intoxication from espresso martinis.

The broadcast transitioned to preparations for a "Super Ball" segment—a testicular torture contest between Raphael and Matt—with suggestions for increasingly painful challenges being thrown out. Opie's dream about a carnival, Patrick from Cringe Humor, and Than was discussed and humorously interpreted as reflecting Opie's insecurities. They also briefly discussed *Brokeback Mountain*, *Flavor of Love*, and the difficulties of acting, particularly intimate scenes, with Norton expressing reservations about such roles.

A lengthy discussion followed about *Brokeback Mountain*, focusing on the actors' commitment to their roles, including anecdotes about Jared Leto's method acting and the challenges faced by the *Brokeback Mountain* cast, particularly with the kissing scenes.  Audio clips from an Oprah interview were played and discussed with humorous, often crude commentary.  The hosts made frequent homophobic remarks. The conversation then veered to the hosts' attendance at the AVN Awards, with audio clips from interviews with various adult film performers, including gay porn star Mark Sterling, "Tiger," and transvestite "Tanya," played and discussed with derogatory and offensive language. They speculated on producer Steve's potential niche within the adult film industry. Several listener calls were interspersed, including one from "Boathead Jim" recounting a boating accident and another caller accompanying his brother to a court hearing.  Their interaction with their PalTalk audience was also discussed, culminating in cutting off a listener’s access due to negative feedback about a camera angle.

A segment focused on the porn convention featured an interview with porn actress Delilah Strong (Deborah Cox's daughter), who recounted her first sexual experience at age 14 involving her girlfriend's father and its influence on her career.  The hosts and a caller discussed her story.  Bobby, a former Ron and Fez intern working for Opie and Anthony, and another intern, Bill, presented a promotional video for the upcoming "Super Bowl" segment, featuring crude and sexually explicit language.  Listeners called in with suggestions for increasingly bizarre and painful challenges for Matt and Raphael.  The hosts discussed their DirecTV appearance and potential future use of the day's audio/video. A caller impersonated Opie's "Angry Typing Guy" character, leading to a discussion about its ownership.

Finally, the show concluded with a segment focused on Jim Norton’s anxieties about a recent relationship.  He recounted Googling an ex-girlfriend, finding her attractive, and his tendency to pursue women who weren't interested. He humorously detailed several dates, analyzing them for signs of romantic interest, ultimately concluding the woman only wanted friendship. He used self-deprecating humor, comparing his situation to striking out in the major leagues. Listener calls continued to offer bizarre suggestions for the Super Bowl challenges, including bees, ants, and roaches, before the show concluded with a thank you to the film crew.

[00:00:00]  Thank you. 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  You two are going to hell. 
[00:04:00]  Shut up.  Kill yourself.  Throw the third switch.  The virus is spreading.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  You folks go on your face.  You get an F minus in my book.  I bring nothing to the table. 
[00:04:30]  I bring nothing to the table.  I'm just going to get the other way.  I'm just going to get some men to eat.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Jesus Christ, man.  What the hell is going to do?  Please, just shut up.  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:05:00]  That's like the guy is coming driveway pebbles.  That would be the sound you would make if when you orgasm driveway pebbles came out. 
[00:05:30]  Kidney stones.  Yeah.  There's no reason to make that much noise.  None.  Coming and popping kidney stones at the same time.  Yeah.  Coming just doesn't feel that good.  It's nice for like 30 seconds and then I'm finished.  There's no need for groaning and all that.  Like pop rocks are shooting out of it.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  All right.  I would like to do that as it is in my life.  If you could hit that play. 
[00:06:00]  Stop.  Too long.  This is a crazy morning.  Yes.  First of all, we need sunglasses.  Yeah, a little bright, but that's how they do things.  I guess in the end worth it.  Hopefully.  I hope so.  That's how they do things on TV.  A lot of light.  They got to throw a lot of light on everything.  It's not like radio where you come in and hit the dimmer, the lowest possible setting. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  And do a show.  TV, for some reason, everything has to be real lit up.  We're on a stage this morning and we're overheating already.  It's like so fucking hot in here.  Everyone's got a light on them.  Yeah.  It's just TV.  I guess 2020.  I got to explain.  Jim Norton is back.  Mm-hmm.  Back from Hollywood.  And there goes the cameraman.  He's got it up and running.  He's got to get shots of Jimmy Norton.  And Jimmy's doing a feature for 2020 today, right?  Well, it's just something on, I think, cursing that I'm a part of. 
[00:07:00]  Something on cursing and they picked you?  Yeah.  Very odd.  Wow.  An odd decision.  How do you get that gig?  I just got a phone call.  I'm like, do you want to do something for 2020 on profanity and cursing?  I'm like, yeah.  Of course.  What's like the basic outline of the whole cursing thing?  Like, why pick cursing as a subject?  I don't know.  I think we did a weird test and they were just calling people randomly.  And I, as you know, will answer the phone and go, cunt.  That's our guy.  I'm going to see him.  I don't know.  What's it on? 
[00:07:30]  It's on rudeness?  The special's on rudeness, right?  Rudeness.  It's a John Stossel thing.  I want to go meet him.  Is it necessarily rude if you curse?  No.  I guess it's...  I think in proper company, if you're playing poker with your friends or something, I think  cursing is quite natural.  I agree.  Ah, shit.  All right.  They got their story.  They can get out of here.  See?  You answered the question.  I think it's...  Cursing's not rude.  Goodbye.  It's all in context.  Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.  Goodbye, goodbye.  I know there are plenty of circumstances where you would be maybe meeting a girlfriend's 
[00:08:00]  family for the first time and really have to concentrate on keeping your language  in check because, uh, hey, your daughter's fucking adorable.  It doesn't quite wash with the dad.  How are you, sir?  Her asshole tastes like cotton candy.  Oh, just kidding.  Sorry.  And he says true and you both laugh.  You laugh and you laugh and you laugh.  Yeah.  I think it's not necessarily rude.  Right.  Are you hitting the streets, too?  Yeah.  I mean, I don't even know what the whole thing's about. 
[00:08:30]  I have no idea.  I mean, I'm just...  I have to talk to people and ask questions.  Are you going to be the test subject?  I guess so, yeah.  Like, just asking them questions and maybe cursing a little.  That's it.  Why the fat suit?  Oh.  Oh, you're not teasing, of course.  You lost so much weight.  That's what the latest rage has been in these news programs and some of the talk shows that  they're doing.  They put women in fat suits, drive them around, in awful fat suits, drive them around, drop  them off and see how rude people are to them because they laugh behind their back. 
[00:09:00]  Meanwhile, it's so obvious they're laughing at the bad fat suit.  Right.  And not that the person is overweight.  Look, they don't acknowledge this during the pieces.  No.  How many overweight people walk past you on a daily basis?  You don't give it a second thought.  It's just another person on the Manhattan streets.  But I would turn and look and go, look at that.  But what the fuck is the rubber?  The thing is hanging from your chin.  And for some reason, that's newsworthy.  Yeah.  That's what they're doing.  I like the cursing angle.  Yeah.  That's good because no one's done that. 
[00:09:30]  I don't know how they're going to do it on regular television.  It's easy here on satellite.  Jimmy said fuck.  Yeah.  It's easy.  It's the new medium.  For some reason, when you beam it into outer space and bring it back, it's a filter that  all of a sudden nobody cares that you're cursing.  Well, cursing is only part of it, right?  I mean, I think that's just one of the segments for the whole story.  Yeah.  Oh, the rest is just being kind of rude.  Yeah, the hour's on rudeness, and we have one segment of the story on cursing.  Oh, okay.  So the hour's on rudeness, one segment, is on cursing part of being rude. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, gotcha.  I guess other things that are rude are like parents that take their kids into restaurants  and let them run around screaming around your fucking table when you're trying to eat.  That's pretty rude.  How about parents with kids anywhere, on a plane, sitting behind you, the kid's crying,  he wants a candy bar, he wants a candy bar.  And the parent decides at that moment it's time to parent and not give the kid a candy  bar.  Give the kid heroin if he asks for it on an airplane and he's behind you, because I'm 
[00:10:30]  trying to sleep.  I understand it's first class and they paid a high ticket price for their child also, but  I'm a fancy man.  I don't want to sit and listen to a kid crying.  That's rude.  That's rude.  You didn't cover your fucking mouth.  Yeah.  And you just cursed.  That's true.  Ooh, I'm trying to get camera time.  What are you, stupid?  There's a lot of rudeness going on in this studio right now.  So what are the things they're covering?  I even hid, look how smart I am.  I even hid my club soda bottles knowing that Canada Dry might not be a sponsor, so I didn't 
[00:11:00]  want him to have to blur anything out.  There's a Dr. Pepper.  Opie's not getting on camera.  That's not, that's in E-Roc's area.  You might get a residual one.  We're not going to be on camera at all.  I guess you aren't.  You focus on Jimmy Norton.  I know, it's all about Jimmy, isn't it?  I want everybody on camera.  It's all about Hollywood Jimmy now, isn't it?  Oh no.  No, babe, it's not about that at all.  Babe.  Oh, they'll make it look good and they'll get shots of Anthony and myself, but when this  piece rolls, it's going to be all Jim Norton B-roll. 
[00:11:30]  No, here's what's probably going to happen.  It's going to be why I'm turning into an Opie and Anthony thing and they're just going  to pan past me and talk to you guys.  Dare to dream.  No, it's going to be all about Jim Norton and they're going to call it Jim Norton's  radio show even.  You watch.  No, no, Norton and Friends.  That's the name of the show.  You're being rude.  Part of the segment.  We've been around long enough to know that they will film for four hours and they'll have  maybe 20 seconds of Jim Norton on mic.  Hey guys, did you get the VU meters?  That's always the staple.  Anytime a camera goes into a studio, get the meters, get them working the board or something 
[00:12:00]  and the clock and the on-air light.  The on-the-air light.  The standard radio B-roll.  Let's go to Tuna Can Charlie.  Tuna Can Charlie, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I finally get up in the nerve to go see King Kong, get the babysitter, get my wife  out, having a good time in the theater.  Just at the point where the monkey's on top of the building, the hot rod is up there,  he's taking wounds in the back, starts sliding out the building, all we hear is, 
[00:12:30]  wah, wah.  Somebody brought a three-year-old to see King Kong.  No, they didn't bring a three-year-old to see King Kong.  They brought a three-year-old because they couldn't afford or find or care to get a  babysitter.  And that's why young children are in the movie theater.  They think it's their own living room and they can sit there with a whining brat and everybody  should not care because they don't care.  Because that's the love of their life, the sparkle of their eye, their joy.  And to me, it is a pain in the ass.  You want to turn around and scream at them. 
[00:13:00]  But then you end up getting stomped like a police officer in White Castle.  You can't open your mouth anymore.  When people are rude, you've got to shut up and take it because you don't know if you're  going to get stabbed or shot telling people to shut up anymore.  If you can't shoot them immediately, you can't say anything.  That's basically what it is with rudeness.  You have to just shut your mouth.  Are you saying people should just carry guns all the time and shoot anyone that's rude?  It doesn't even matter.  This guy, the cop had a gun, didn't he?  Yeah, he did.  Off-30, the cop had a gun, and he still got beat up by five guys.  He should have pulled it immediately and started shooting them. 
[00:13:30]  Pull a Bernie Getz on him, right?  Absolutely.  I sense something was wrong.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And I was reading that story.  I don't understand how five – I don't understand that mob mentality.  From the video surveillance, it looked like the guy got hit immediately before he said  or was able to throw another punch.  And five guys are on top of him kicking him.  What happened to his – hey, you know, Bobby's doing an all right job beating the shit out of him.  Let's leave it alone. 
[00:14:00]  The five guys got to pile on and just stomp with boots on the guy.  I don't get it.  He should have pulled his gun out.  It would have been a joy to see an officer pull his gun out and shoot a few of these guys  and send the others running and end it that way, the happy movie ending.  And then it ends with friendly fire.  I know the cop shoots the off-duty cop that was in this scuffle.  It's a sick story here in New York today.  Thanks, Hawk.  Hawk handing out the story that we're already through with. 
[00:14:30]  Thank you, Hawk.  Good job.  Good job with the dittos today.  I covered that.  Wait a minute.  The wife said we're holding up okay.  Thanks, Hawk.  Needed that part of the –  All right.  Move on.  Hawk is sponsored by Dr. Pepper.  He just gave me a note, 2020 in studio.  Thanks.  Watch your mouth.  Might want to mention that today.  Let's go to Tom in New Jersey.  Tom, what's up?  Hawk, could you hide the Hellman's mayonnaise jar there?  Might have to blur that out. 
[00:15:00]  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, Owen?  Hey.  Hi.  Just want to tell you guys, I bought a Sirius radio and an XM radio, and I chose you guys  over Stern.  I mean, the guy is just such an asshole.  I can't stand listening to him anymore.  Well, there's one more for our side, Opie.  You guys got another one on your side.  I listened to you way, way, way back when you guys were in New York.  You were terrific.  I was sorry to see you go.  So I called Sirius, and I said I'd like to cancel my subscription, and they asked me why, 
[00:15:30]  and I said, hold on a minute.  I'll tell you.  And I took a sledgehammer to my Sirius radio, and I said, do you know what that was?  They said I took a fucking sledgehammer to my Sirius radio.  That's what I think of you.  Oh, thank you, Tom.  We appreciate that.  Thank you, sir.  We got to warn the listeners, though, and we did this Friday, that the second the Opie  and Anthony show sign a half a billion dollar contract, we will give up trying doing radio.  We will come and phone it in for the paycheck. 
[00:16:00]  Because that's when you lose your passion.  We do understand what he did.  We call it passion, but it's not passion.  We want to get to the next contract.  It's called food and a big roof.  It's greed.  It's greed.  Complete greed is good.  That drives us to do this on a daily basis.  It's called I like being blown.  I'd like to be blown for a few more years.  It's a clever ruse that we say we have passion for this still.  But, no, it's greed, and we want to get to the next contract so we, too, could sit back and do nothing.  Thanks, Tom.  You look at the caliber of girl you got when I was knocking tin, and the caliber that is attracted to me when I come here to work on the radio. 
[00:16:30]  I don't want to go back to knocking tin.  All right.  We have a little song in honor of that last phone call.  Oh, no.  When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's...  Is that the China house?  When the world seems to shine like you've had too much wine, that's... 
[00:17:00]  Is that the China house?  Bells will ring, ting-a-ling-a-ling, ting-a-ling-a-ling, and you'll sing...  Back is our God!  Hard to play...  T-I-T.  Tate.  T-I-T.  Tate like a guitar and a-la-la.  When the stars make you jewel, just like a pasta fuzzle, that's... 
[00:17:30]  My vagina.  Of course it is.  Thank you, Emily.  When you dance down the street with a cloud at your feet, you're in love.  And it goes on and on and on.  A little taste there, but the Emily Stern remixes continue to come in, Anthony.  My goodness.  For every ten we listen to, there's one worth playing on the radio.  That was like that duet thing with Nat King Cole and his daughter.  And Natalie? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, Natalie.  They took Dino and Emily Stern and mixed it together.  It was quite a fine little tune.  Nat had that slicked-back hair, style of the Negro of the early tens.  The early tens.  Jesus.  The early tens.  A lot of lye in that hair.  Straighten it out.  Here's another quickie.  OOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDOBIDO 
[00:18:30]  We've got like 50 of these in, and two we're good enough to play.  That's Anthony Bitt.  Thank you, audience.  Actually, we could probably play one more here, and then we'll move on to other things. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, smile, you're on camera.  Ooh!  You can change every time the camera's aimed at you.  Like, yeah, that's a bunch of bullshit.  All right, here's one more.  All right, let's get to the porno awards.  Howard, this is our best anal newcomer.  My lips, my tongue nose, my ass are all godly.  Well, she's a triple threat. 
[00:19:30]  God, and my kids, my kids are godly, my kids are godly, my kids are godly.  She had her first lesbian experience.  Yes.  Everybody immediately knows my kids.  Letters, P-I-D.  Parents divorced.  You know the story, Robin.  It's an old story.  This is really great theater. 
[00:20:00]  I'm so happy.  I'm a small person.  I learned so much.  I just knew that within a blink of an eye, I was in a ten-person anal gangbang.  Thank you.  Good night, everybody.  That one's a little brutal.  And not as good as the other two.  Went one too many.  One too many there with the Howard Stern, Emily Stern remixes.  All right.  Moving on.  A lot of people want to say hi to Jimmy.  He's back in the fold here. 
[00:20:30]  Justin in Texas.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Hey, does that ever bother y'all how Jimmy just kind of comes and goes as he pleases like  some sort of Hollywood fancy man?  Sir, it's not like a Hollywood fancy man.  It's because I am one.  That's why I come and go.  No.  Okay.  I don't come and go as I please.  It's all scheduled.  No, it is as you please.  Well, yeah, but I mean, it is scheduled.  I'll be here actually for two hours today.  I have some stuff.  Okay.  Only two hours.  He has personal stuff at home to catch up on. 
[00:21:00]  I'm glad to have you back, Jimmy.  I'm glad to have you back.  Got to unpack his bags.  Yes.  No, I think we have Jimmy.  I have my valet doing that open.  I think we have Jimmy for a while now.  Maybe.  How long?  Three, four months.  No way.  Probably even more than that.  That long?  Yeah.  Eight, nine years.  What about our new friends?  Yeah, what about our new friends?  Patrice O'Neal and Billy Burr?  I'm sure that they bring little fun things from Boston.  I bring the news.  They bring what they want.  Self-centered ass they are.  I bring the news for you.  All right.  Good point, Jimmy. 
[00:21:30]  Good point, sir.  Good point.  We can't argue.  We can't argue that.  First day back, he's got 2020 here.  That's a good thing.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Poe in West Virginia.  Poe, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Hi, Poe.  Hey, I got to tell you, that Stern remix is some of the greatest shit I've ever heard.  Well, except for the last one.  The last one.  Well, yeah, but you got to say, bless Stern and his wonderful genes to give us such a comic relief  there, you know?  I just wish she had done the play for a little longer so we would have had more clips. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, yeah, but, you know, when you got a smut like fucking Stern, you know, God bless  him, though.  All right.  His radio sucks, but at least his genes give us some good laughs.  All right.  Thank you, Poe.  Hey, love you guys.  Hey, love you, too.  Let's go to Scott in Pennsylvania.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, Scott.  We just want to wish Jimmy, um, I'm glad he's back.  Thank you, sir.  It's good to be back.  Um, Patrice was fantastic on the show, but Jimmy, you are the man, and, uh, Howard sucks. 
[00:22:30]  Way to sum it all up.  Well, let's go.  Patrice was funny.  Jim, glad you're back, and we don't like Howard.  Patrice brings a great element to the table.  Yeah, he's right.  I started with John on one of the TV shows coming up soon.  I'm not sure what channel it's on, but they're doing a, uh, a promo on Sterling John of how  he changed from, uh, Howard over to the Leno show and all that stuff, so, uh...  Could you slow down a little?  Yeah, you're really bringing too much excitement. 
[00:23:00]  I know, man.  You're on the table here.  Help us out.  Sorry about that, Paul.  We're in an uncomfortable spot as is with all these bright lights in our eyes and a camera  crew and getting to know Jimmy again, and then we go to the phones, and you're like,  you're like a sloth.  Okay.  Will, uh, will the Starbucks be, uh, pixelated out of the shot for Jimmy?  Judd and John.  I'm just looking out for you.  He's shy.  Frank is shy.  By the way, when the poor guy has to work back there and pixelate...  Yeah, this call is still talking.  By the way...  We have no... 
[00:23:30]  We have not a care what he said.  Scott, we gave up on you a while ago.  No, go ahead, Scott.  Start over, man.  I apologize.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Welcome back, Jim.  Thank you.  All right.  By the way, can I request something?  Yeah.  Um, and I'm doing this as a welcome back gift for you guys.  I would like to request no more happy birthday wishes.  None.  That's it.  Bit over.  Yeah, it's over.  Where Jimmy, it would be his birthday every day, and it was funny for, like, the first  week.  You just started the bit up again.  I'm not dumb.  No, I didn't actually.  I know the calls are going to come in, but I would like... 
[00:24:00]  I would...  Not serious calls only.  I would like that bit to stop.  Did you...  You did see through that, didn't you?  Please tell me you did.  No one had wished him a happy birthday.  But I know he will.  That's why he's bummed out.  No, that's why I wanted...  He wants to restart the bit.  No, I want the bit over, and I did that before they did it, so it wouldn't seem like  I'm just...  Oh, yeah, by the way, could you?  Before...  No more.  Damn it!  He seems sincere.  My birthday is in July.  July 19th is my birthday.  Do you really want the bit, Dan?  Yes, I do.  Yes.  He does seem sincere.  I swear to God, if I'm lying, Hawk will blow me.  Oh, well.  So you're lying. 
[00:24:30]  No.  I actually don't want them to stop the bit, please.  Obviously, you're lying, then.  Just hello.  I get them in the emails now, in the fucking MySpaces.  All right, let's go to Rob in Florida.  Happy birthday.  Right.  I get it.  Rob?  Yeah, who's this Norton guy pulling in for Patrice?  He's kind of dry.  Is Patrice going to be back soon?  No, sir.  And when you see Patrice, wish him a happy birthday for me.  Love you, Jimmy.  Thank you, man.  I knew he was lying when he said Norton is dry, like I'm fucking Stephen Wright.  Yeah.  Let's go to Rob in Oregon. 
[00:25:00]  Rob?  Hey, welcome back, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, I was just wondering if you're willing to take a mousetrap like Bill Burr.  Did Bill Burr take a mousetrap?  Yeah, Bill Burr did.  Bill Burr started a nice bit.  By the way, I got some really good bruises on this right hand.  He started a bit if a joke bombs.  Usually, we just take it.  But if a joke bombs, you had to stick your hand in a mousetrap.  It was.  We all had mousetraps in front of us.  It was very uncomfortable for a dog.  It's sort of like that putting a rubber band around your wrist, and every time you take 
[00:25:30]  a puff of a cigarette, you snap it.  Right.  It's supposed to keep you from smoking.  This way, we would only have quality jokes on the air, because every time you bomb,  you're getting a mousetrap.  Right.  It would psychologically get you to do a performance.  Well, then the mousetrap took on a life of its own.  You heard about what Stalker Patty did.  Yeah, Patty, of course.  Where's that video, by the way?  Why can't we download that video?  Stalker Patty completely naked.  Not a stitch of clothing on her 50-year-old virginal body.  She was walking on all fours, on the floor, looking for two $1,000 checks that the listeners 
[00:26:00]  had come up with to pay her rent.  But the checks were surrounded by mousetraps.  So she's naked, trying to grab these checks, and mousetraps are snapping on her hands and  feet, and it was hysterical.  And the poor woman can't just get a charity check from us.  She's got to have mousetraps snapped on her finger.  That's a great idea, by the way, the mousetraps.  Oh, it was wonderful.  Thank you, Jimmy.  Steve. 
[00:26:30]  Yes?  Why can't I couldn't find that freaking video all weekend?  Because it's on foundrymusic.com.  Yes.  No, your mic's not on.  Your mic, it works like your website.  It doesn't.  It is the hardest website to navigate.  I heard three schooners ran aground trying to navigate your awful website.  Okay, where's the mousetrap?  I'll snap it.  Yeah, please.  I now see the beauty of that.  Would you please take a freaking mousetrap for giving me that?  Asshole minor shit.  No, where was the video?  It's been there the whole time.  I actually linked it up, but I was too busy doing the American mess stuff. 
[00:27:00]  I got complaints because people couldn't find this video.  I linked it up like the day it came up there, but then I did like three other updates since  then.  I can put it back up.  Can you move that up to the top of the list again?  Yeah, of course.  Because a lot of people haven't seen Patty crawling around the floor getting hit by mousetraps.  Look at her.  Look at that.  She's got that ET body completely naked.  She's curled up in the fetal position trying to expose as little of that awful body as possible.  I'm surprised a tit didn't get caught in a mousetrap dragging on the floor. 
[00:27:30]  So the video will be back up top so people can find it very easily on foundrymusic.com  and opianthony.com.  And opianthony.com as well as the American mess videos are up.  So then we had this happen, Jimmy, right?  And we didn't think we could top ourselves.  Then a guy decided he wanted to come in and take a mousetrap to his scrotum.  Yeah, I kept up on the message boards.  Well, I'm bringing it up because that video has been downloaded over 30,000 times in less  than four days.  A guy came in pretty much right where you're sitting, took his ball bag out, and exactly 
[00:28:00]  where you're sitting, as a matter of fact, and stretched the scrotal skin and triggered  the mousetrap so it snapped right on his scrotum.  Did he yell?  Oh, he yelped.  Oh, yeah.  It was a yelp.  Have you seen the video yet?  No.  That's why I won't be seeing.  Oh, you don't want to see it?  Of course I do.  Yeah, well, turn around.  Of course you want to see it.  So here's the video that's being downloaded like crazy.  It's on opianthony.com right now.  We'd love to get sound for you, too, but it's not hooked up in this studio. 
[00:28:30]  And then I think what's going to happen, we're not done with the mousetraps.  There's two guys, if they show up, they're going to come in Thursday, Jimmy, and have  a mousetrap, ball bag, face-off.  Stretched out and...  Ah!  That never gets old.  Look at the guy's face.  Oh, that's wonderful.  If you haven't seen the video yet, it's on opianthony.com.  He's got his pants down, and it's just hanging off his bag.  Yeah.  Well, then, I think it was Patrice.  Who made the observation? 
[00:29:00]  He had to pull it off his ball bag.  He couldn't release it.  Was it Patrice?  You'll, you'll, if, if it's long, yeah, there you go.  You see him pull it right off instead of undoing the, uh, the mousetrap.  Let's go to Nate in Brooklyn.  Nate, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Yeah, I just wanted to say, I saw the Patty video this weekend.  Yeah.  She looks like Gollum crawling through the caves.  Yeah, some other people suggested it was like the, uh, the end of the ring.  Just nasty.  Where that, uh, nasty well girl came crawling out of the television set. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Said, uh, Patty looked like that also.  So, it was an awful sight to behold.  All right, let's go to Dave in Jersey.  Dave, what's up?  What's up, bub-bu-boy?  Hey, Dave.  Welcome back, Jimmy.  Thanks, man.  Hey, saw Billy Burr Saturday night.  He was fucking awesome.  Where'd you see him?  Awesome.  Stress factory.  Okay.  Awesome.  Yeah, thanks for supporting Bill Burr and Patrice O'Neal over the weekend.  I heard, uh, both those guys did really, really well.  How was Patrice?  He was down in Philly.  Oh, okay.  They had, they had some fucking Norton wannabe opening it. 
[00:30:00]  They had a Joe DiRizzo or something.  A Norton wannabe?  Yeah.  Who isn't?  Who isn't a Norton wannabe?  Totally Norton humor.  Hey.  Joe DiRizzo?  You think so?  Joe DiRizzo, DiRizzo, DiRizzo.  I don't know.  I'm asking.  Yeah, Joe DiRizzo, I think.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, but, uh, hey, you guys are the best.  I'm so happy you guys are back.  Thank you.  Uh, long time listener to WNEW, and, uh, punch it, punch it out, boys.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Thank you.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:30:30]  All right.  We got lots of radio to do today.  Mm-hmm.  2020 is in the house.  Jim Norton is back from Hollywood.  Oh, was I getting sick of L.A.?  Yeah.  No, you weren't.  Yeah, I really was.  No, you weren't.  You're an L.A. phony now.  No.  You're a star.  You're going to be on a hugely successful HBO comedy series.  Boy, did I get called out by someone for being a Hollywood phony.  It was so funny.  This guy in the, uh, uh, uh, I was at the comp, the, uh, improv on Melrose, and I was  saying hi to a friend of mine, Jerry, and his friend was there.  Oh, by the way, it was Jerry Seinfeld. 
[00:31:00]  That's how phony he's got.  A friend of mine, Jerry.  No, this was, uh, no, believe me, I would have said Seinfeld.  I would have tried to say it casually.  All right.  I would have said, you know, can I tell you I'm almost spitting David Spade's face?  Yeah.  Okay.  I didn't hear that one.  I called in with, uh, so this guy.  I called in with that.  I wasn't listening.  Oh.  Other things go on.  I don't listen to you.  Pal talk.  Tits.  I'm looking at tits on a video camera.  I don't have time to listen to Jim Garton's dribble.  He's looking at tits, and he hears Ope say something.  He goes, yeah, yeah.  It was on the phone. 
[00:31:30]  So I'm talking to this guy, Jerry, and he introduced me to his friend.  He goes, yeah, this is so-and-so.  I go, hey, man, good to see you, and I start talking.  He goes, don't give me that phony Hollywood shit.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  I'm like, Jesus, you're right.  You just caught me being completely phony.  It's not good to see you, so I apologize.  Thank God you occasionally come back here and ground yourself again, because you know  what happens to people out there.  Exactly that.  Glad to see you.  It's worse and worse, right?  No, good to see you.  It was so dismissive.  Good to see you.  Good to see you.  And then just turn around and not acknowledge him anymore.  I forgot he-I would have forgotten he existed if he didn't call me out and say, don't 
[00:32:00]  give me that phony Hollywood shit.  So now what happens?  The show is filmed.  Lucky Louie's done.  Yes.  How many episodes?  12?  Plus pilots, the 13 total.  13 episodes of Lucky Louie.  Apparently, supposedly it's after Entourage again.  We don't know.  I mean, that's what I've heard.  In June, we started-  My favorite HBO show, by the way, Entourage.  Yeah, hopefully we won't blow it after a great lead-in like that.  Right.  And then we see what they want to do.  So now they're just throwing the shows together?  And I heard your part got bigger and bigger as the filming went on.  Yeah, they expanded it a bit, which was great. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, I got to say more and more stuff, which was kind of nice.  That's why I didn't call in the last couple weeks until I'm getting up earlier, because  I had like a scene in the beginning, a scene in the middle, and then a scene towards the  end.  That's pretty exciting.  Oh.  I will say at one point in this series, I got one of these in.  Oh!  A really good long one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was so happy I got that in.  From the midget wedding proposal.  Yeah.  Wow.  And then when does it air?  Again, when June's sometime, I don't know when exactly.  You know HBO.  They have no clue when things air. 
[00:33:00]  HBO's so weird.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They don't have to wear the ratings.  By the time it airs, you're going to be like, oh, yeah, I did that thing.  I saw a gag reel at the wrap party they showed.  Like, just a bunch of us forgetting a bunch of music.  A gag reel at the wrap party.  Forgetting my lines, you know?  And what a fat pig I look like on film.  I really am unattractive.  Thank God I'm in comedy.  I'm an unattractive guy.  Does the camera add 10 pounds?  Dude, it's just like they said.  It removes all shape, too.  I looked like a tall mealworm on camera.  I was really embarrassed about how I look on camera.  But you've lost weight.  Because I was just telling Jimmy in the office that last night, I'm going around the channels 
[00:33:30]  and we pop up on your special, your comedy special that you taped for HBO.  And I don't even remember when you did that.  A year ago?  I can't believe that's almost a year ago, man.  April?  Yeah.  April, a year ago.  And me and my girlfriend were like, wow, Jimmy's lost a lot of weight.  And it's a good thing that you lost the weight or else the comment would have been, what a  fat fuck this guy is.  I was borderline fat jokes working on me. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Like when Bob Kelly is so depressed because he'll walk in and he'll do a fat joke and  everybody just laughs like, ah, yeah, he's a fat fuck.  And it's really upsetting for him that now fat jokes can be applied to him.  And I was really close to that.  Yeah, you couldn't really tell from the head-on view, but when you turned sideways, you had  a gut on you that was poking out from your t-shirt and buttoned, you know, the second  shirt.  He had fat clothes on.  But it was coming through the fat clothes, that's what I was saying.  That's the bad news, man.  It was kind of coming through and showing even through the fat clothes.  Yeah, I would actually, I put weight back on, like probably like an extra 10 pounds, 
[00:34:30]  which I want to lose.  For the role?  No, because I have a sore foot and I'm lazy.  I haven't exercised since Vegas.  Yeah, he's just like Robert De Niro.  For the role, I put on the weight.  I felt the character called for a complete...  Yeah.  No, he put that on because of childhood.  Porch food.  Right.  I was actually just smacking my fat stomach.  I was in the trailer in the mirror and I walked in and I was changing my shirt and I  just started smacking my stomach.  Yeah.  I've got to lose weight again.  Yeah.  I've got to lose another 10, 15 pounds. 
[00:35:00]  All right.  Where's E-Rock?  I want to play something for you.  You might have heard the kid imitating you.  No.  You haven't heard this yet?  I haven't heard anything.  We've played this once and we kind of saved it to play it again until you got back into  town.  You know who's dedicated to doing a role?  And I don't understand how people can do this.  Christian Bale.  Yep.  He went from The Machinist to the Batman movie where he's all ripped and everything.  And he was concentration camp in The Machinist.  Now that's the type of dedication, Jimmy, that I want to see from you as a Hollywood insider 
[00:35:30]  now.  My dedication is this.  I roll in for a 10 o'clock read.  It's three minutes to 10.  And I make it every day.  That's my dedication.  I show up.  I fucking blow a lot of lines.  Yeah.  Believe me, I thought I was going to get fired all season.  All season.  Are you bad with your lines?  No, but I just have no self-esteem.  I hear they love you.  It's just scary, though.  You think you're going to get canned?  They love Jim Norton.  Is it that you remember your lines, you just don't say them with the gusto they should  be said?  Yeah, well.  Yeah. 
[00:36:00]  No confidence?  The fucking dude Mike that I'm doing most of my scenes with is like a second city guy,  like a fucking seasoned funny bastard.  I'm like, oh my God, I'm such a fraud.  They're going to find out.  They're going to dump me.  Act, act, act, act.  It's really frightening.  The funny thing is, the show's going to hit and he's going to be a huge star and no one's  going to notice any of that crap.  And then we lose him.  Nah.  Yeah.  Not at all.  By the way, that guy in Long Island didn't mention me once in the article.  It was very hurt.  Who continues? 
[00:36:30]  Oh, well.  Oh, the Long Island Press article?  It was very hurt, yes.  Who continues?  Like, if somebody like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise was doing a radio show before they hit and  then they hit, do you honestly think they would be sitting behind a mic doing the radio  show trying to get their movies, to fit their movies in during their radio schedule?  Excellent example.  Well, Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise or myself.  Very accurate comparison.  Yeah, because they started as shock jocks.  Exactly.  Idiots. 
[00:37:00]  Believe it, those guys lead the way.  They don't follow like I do.  Fucking Kenny Coatail Runner.  I say, regardless of the looks, I'm talking about the success factor there.  There's a success factor.  They're doing movies, dude.  I'm doing a role that's written kind of.  Now they write in my voice, so it's easier for me to do it.  But I'm very limited.  I can do what I can do, and that's great.  But I'm not going to go out and do movies.  I auditioned for a Will Ferrell movie.  I stunk.  I was terrible.  In a Will Ferrell movie?  The audition.  Awful.  I was awful.  I'm not a good auditioner. 
[00:37:30]  Rachel, you've come back.  It was so...  Did you definitely blow it, you think?  I blew it.  No doubt in your mind.  They're not going to call you back?  Dude, they're not even going to remember that I was there, and the guy liked my stuff.  It was like I was sitting on the chair, and third line in, I'm like, you're not getting  this.  Third line in.  So you lost all confidence.  Yeah.  So, where are you going?  Listen, thank you for seeing me.  I appreciate it.  It was the day of the transit strike.  I went down there, and I just stunk.  It was terrible.  Well, we've got to play this for Jimmy.  I can't believe you haven't heard this yet. 
[00:38:00]  We've got to play the original so people get it.  But basically, a kid, I think he's 10, Jillian versus San Jose Caller.  Remember the San Jose Caller?  Was that from N.E.W. here?  No, here.  When you ripped into the guy.  I don't remember.  The famous lines came from this phone call.  Oh, okay.  Anyway, this guy took his, I don't know how he knows this kid, a 10-year-old, and the  10-year-old does your lines.  Beautiful.  But we want to do the original first, just so people understand what's going on here.  So this is Jim Norton just going at an angry caller.  Listen to this.  What I'm saying is, person who I hope dies of cancer the day before a relative gets married, 
[00:38:30]  what type of a skit would you like to hear?  And you're not being specific.  You're being passive-aggressive like every other faggot from that state that you live in.  So will you please be specific?  Get out of your mouth and talk right.  Be specific.  Get out of your mouth.  Oh, he got you there.  Oh, I got a cock in my mouth.  Well, it's your father.  Since your mother won't suck it, I decided to lean over and toot on it a little bit.  What's up with the wrist, huh?  What's that?  You're here in San Francisco sucking cock, you fat.  Oh, there we go. 
[00:39:00]  That's the type of skit you like, isn't it?  Dirty two men talking about sucking cocks.  Now we got what you like.  Two men going back and forth.  So tell us what you want, Kenny.  Why do we just have these truck drivers calling in?  You know, which I agree, they're fine, they're great callers, but we all ain't all for them to fail.  Oh, I know you want to sketch with a funny southern voice.  That's probably the type of comedy you like.  The type of thing where the funny voice is happening, or maybe the gay character comes in,  Hi, boy. 
[00:39:30]  And you're like, ha, ha, that's good.  The guy sounds gay.  I'm having a real hard time understanding you.  No, you're not, stupid.  Bad speech impairment, don't you?  What's an impairment, you fucking idiot?  I speak perfectly clearly.  And you understand everything I'm saying.  I've asked you for a show that you listen to.  Let me finish, fucker.  I've asked you for something that you like, and you haven't been able to provide it.  Name me one show you listen to.  Name me one show.  But I'm listening to, I've been an XM subscriber for over a year. 
[00:40:00]  I don't give a shit, cancel the service, faggot.  Tell me something you listen to.  Don't, you're not going to blackmail me.  I'm an XM subscriber.  I don't get a piece of the action, motherfucker.  What do I care?  Oh, shit, don't lose a customer.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and then fuck your mother.  Tell me what you want to hear.  Tell me what you want to hear.  You're not answering the question.  How about something funny?  What show do you think is funny?  You got something funny.  What show?  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  No, I'm not going to wait a minute, you cop sucker. 
[00:40:30]  What to tell me to wait a minute, you faggoty West Coast caller?  You know what you fucking get paid to do?  Yes, I get paid a lot to do this.  That's the beauty of it.  I don't know, and you're fucking ripping them off all the way to the bank.  Oh, I'm laughing all the way to the bank, am I, you cliche-slinging bucket of jism.  I hope you killed a drunk driving accident on New Year's Eve.  We want to hear some sketches with southern voices.  Get behind the wheel after drinking a few and plow into a pregnant lady.  How's that for a sketch? 
[00:41:00]  West Coast jerk-off?  What a despicable human being you are.  I know, me, him.  He's one of the calling and popping shit.  I'm trying to have fun on the radio.  Fun!  Calling in and fucking wrecking the vibe.  2020's packing up now.  You've offended them.  So, that's the original, obviously.  So, then...  What could possibly make that funnier?  So, this 10-year-old kid plays your role in the same phone call. 
[00:41:30]  Listen to this.  I'll tell you what could be funnier is if I actually said that to a 10-year-old.  So, you have the reference point.  Redone with a 10-year-old doing Jim Norton's lines.  What I'm saying is, person who I hope dies of cancer the day before a relative gets married,  what type of a skit would you like to hear?  And you're not being specific.  You're being passive-aggressive like every other faggot from that state you live in.  So, will you please be specific?  Get your mouth and talk right.  Be specific.  Get out of your mouth. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, he got you there.  Oh, I got a cock in my mouth.  Well, it's your father since your mother won't suck it.  I decided to lean over and toot on it a little bit.  What's that?  I'm here in San Francisco sucking cock, you fat.  Oh, there we go.  That's the type of skit you like, isn't it?  Dirty two men talking about sucking cock.  Now we got what you like.  Two men going back and forth.  So tell us what you want, Kenny.  Why?  Why do we just have these truck drivers calling in?  You know, which I agree.  They're fine.  They're great callers.  But we all ain't all for them to fail. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, I know you.  You want a sketch with a funny something voice.  That's probably the type of comedy you like.  The type of thing where the funny voice is happening or maybe the gay character comes in.  Hi, boys.  And you're like, oh, the guy sounds gay.  I'm having a real hard time understanding you.  No, you're not stupid.  Bad speech impairment, don't you?  What's an impairment, you fucking idiot?  I speak perfectly clearly and you understand everything I'm saying.  Let me finish, fucker.  I've asked you for something that you like and you haven't been able to provide it. 
[00:43:00]  Name me one show you listen to.  Name me one show.  What I'm listening to, I've been an XM subscriber for over a year.  I don't give a shit.  Cancel the service, faggot.  Tell me something you listen to.  You're not going to blackmail me.  I'm an XM subscriber.  I don't get a piece of the action, motherfucker.  What do I care?  Oh, shit.  Don't lose a customer.  I don't care if you throw your XM down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and then fuck your mother.  Tell me what you want to hear.  Tell me what you want to hear. 
[00:43:30]  You're not answering the question.  I want something funny.  What show do you think is funny?  I want something funny.  What show?  Wait a minute.  No, I'm not going to wait a minute, you cocksucker.  Don't tell me to wait a minute.  What are you doing, man?  Faggoty West Coast caller.  You know what you fucking get paid to do?  Yes.  I get paid a lot to do this.  That's the beauty of it.  I don't know.  And you're fucking ripping them off all the way to the bank.  Oh, I'm laughing all the way to bank, am I?  You cliche slinging bucket of jism.  I hope you're killed in a drunk driving accident on New Year's Eve.  Come on, fuck.  We want to hear some sketches with southern voices. 
[00:44:00]  Get behind the wheel after drinking a few and plow into a pregnant lady.  How's that for a sketch, West Coast jerk-off?  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  And there you have it.  Wow.  Hey, you did a great job with it.  Something funny about a kid cursing.  And if I would have known that was going to happen, I would have changed some of the language.  Of course you would have.  Yes.  2020 people, very happy.  They've got enough cursing now.  Yeah, a little lad.  There's plenty for you. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, a little lad.  All right.  That's kind of uncomfortable.  Isn't it?  Yeah.  Just a tad?  A little bit, a little bit.  Especially the thing about him and me and the dad jerking.  What an irresponsible parent that was that sent that in.  All right.  As we go to break, got a communique here from Steve.  Mousetrap Video is now up and loaded again on opianathlete.com.  So you can download that and the American Mess videos.  Have you checked those out yet, Ed?  Oh, they're horrific.  Why are they horrific?  Just Scoliope.  The other one.  Who was the other one? 
[00:45:00]  Half of, no, half of backface is Scoliope.  What were we calling the other guy?  Neo.  Neo is God.  I don't know.  Yeah, Neo is God.  But he had a little nickname, too.  I don't remember what his nickname is already.  There's some guy that had red hair, looked, I mean, just like the mask.  Rocky Dennis?  Rocky Dennis.  And he came in, and he was just a complete mess.  And one of the listeners came up with a great name for him, Scoli, because he had scoliosis.  He's a man, Scoliope.  Well, he was dressed like me. 
[00:45:30]  He was dressed like me, too.  Yeah, he had, like, Opie clothes on.  He had a glass eye that he popped out, half his upper teeth that he popped out.  He took his shirt off, and it was just a mess.  What they had to do, because he had some kind of weird tumor skin thing on the left side of his face.  So they put a balloon in his back and slowly pumped it up over the course of a couple of months to stretch the skin out, to make enough spare skin on his back to put on his face. 
[00:46:00]  So now he can only grow, like, half a beard and pop, I mean, complete mess.  He wound up winning American Mess, and he's going to Los Angeles.  Well, the first stage of American Mess, because we're going to do it every Friday.  Open call for more American Messes to show up this coming Friday.  I think there's a guy coming from St. Louis.  See, we got a banner with a blatant ripoff of the American Idol logo.  So that means it's legit.  It's an official contest.  I guess there's a guy coming on Friday with no arms, no legs. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, no, wait, no arms, but he can drink beers with his feet.  Oh, with his feet. He does everything with his feet.  Supposedly he's coming from St. Louis with one of the truckers.  What's the prize?  Well, the first, last week, we gave away two trips to the lingerie bowl.  In L.A.?  In L.A.?  Nice.  I don't know what we're giving away this Friday, but we'll see.  I don't know who's going to have to sit next to those two on the plane.  Does that guy have, like, self-esteem issues, you think?  Just a bit.  But they both actually were in pretty good spirits about the whole thing.  Yeah, I got to say, I didn't feel that at all. 
[00:47:00]  I swear to God.  It's either, you know, that or they would have killed themselves, I think.  Because Neo, I guess we called him Osis.  He had so many Osis diseases.  Oh, right. Yeah, that was it.  He had a laundry list of Osises.  Like, whatever Osis, this Osis, Osis.  And some made his back curve, and some gave him the head that he had.  He didn't have self-esteem issues, I'm telling you.  Because we invited Stalker Patty in, and he didn't want anything to do with her.  Like, oh, come on, man.  They're both virgins.  Yeah, just all pissed off that we even suggest that he's so desperate that he would only get Stalker Patty. 
[00:47:30]  So I didn't see the self-esteem thing with either one of those guys.  They were just dealing with what they have to deal with.  American Mass, biggest mess is coming in every Friday.  Winner gets a Sky-Fi 2 and a Boombox this Friday.  Ooh.  All right, so if you're an American mess, and you think you could beat out Scoliope and Osis, come on by this Friday.  We'd like to hear from some of the people coming by Friday, just so we could get pumped for Friday's open call show, okay?  Mm-hmm. 
[00:48:00]  All right, we got lots to do.  2020's in the house.  We have the—you're just distracting me so bad, it's not even funny.  It's all right.  We'll regroup and figure it out.  Hit that, yeah.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  The ONA virus spreading across America. 
[00:48:30]  Spreading nicely, by the way.  You can just feel it.  The show is growing.  We got 2020 in studio.  We got Jim Norton back from Hollywood.  And I'm tired today.  Are ya?  Well, I'm now a restaurant and bar owner.  Restaurateur?  I don't know how the fuck that happened.  I realized that on Friday.  I'm like, wait a minute.  I thought I was just helping my brother out, and now I have realized that I'm a restaurant and bar owner.  Merchandise goes in the front door, comes right out the back door. 
[00:49:00]  There's a fire?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  Struck by lightning?  Fuck you.  Pay me.  Wait, you guys opened up?  We sort of opened up, yes.  For the people that haven't heard, my brother, Brett, he's been in the business for many years.  He's a great chef.  And he finally realized his dream.  He's got his own place in Huntington.  400 New York Avenue.  The place is called FH Riley's.  Whack Bag is already talking about the place and giving it pretty good reviews, I hear.  Yes, yes.  So I was there Friday and Saturday night.  You're like the zagat for retards over there. 
[00:49:30]  But people are confused.  They're thinking it's just a bar because that's the only part we opened up, Friday and Saturday,  because we've got to get some cash in the damn cash register to pay for everything.  But I guess the restaurant opens up this week, finally.  I believe Wednesday.  I'm going to eat there for the first time this Thursday before the Islander Ranger game.  But it's FH Riley's.  Also, a celebrity sighting you could have if you go down there Thursday.  Yeah.  Opie, I just want to say hi.  I'm eating. 
[00:50:00]  Leave me alone.  And you can come up and say hi.  The new thing is people like to sneak pictures with their camera phones.  Just come up.  I'll take a picture with you.  It's no big deal.  But they make them believe they're looking up a number and the cameras point it right at me.  I'm like, dude, I know what you're doing.  Just come up and ask for a picture.  I know what you're doing.  I've done the same thing.  And then a picture ends up on a website of you with spaghetti hanging out of your mouth.  There's a dopey fucking look on your face.  I caught this person at the bar yesterday a couple days ago. 
[00:50:30]  It was Lindsey and I.  We were just drinking at the corner of the bar.  And all of a sudden the guy has his phone up.  And I look at him like, hello.  And then he makes believe he's looking up a number like his friend was supposed to be there.  Oh, I got to see where he is, you know.  But we had a great crowd at FH Riley's, 400 New York Avenue, Huntington, Friday and Saturday night.  A big hi to everyone that stopped by.  What kind of food would it be?  It was very cool.  American.  A little of everything.  Okay.  Getting reviews on the menu.  The menu's up on whackbag.com, by the way.  So, and we had a couple bands Friday and Saturday night. 
[00:51:00]  And my brother-in-law is one of the bartenders.  And this girl, Jen, is the other bartender.  Fish.  You know Fish.  Uh-huh.  He's a character.  So he's...  Not any Jens I know is the bartender, right?  No, no, no.  Absolutely not, Anthony.  No.  Boy, that'd be gone.  Where's all my booze going?  I hope he's marking the bottles.  Why is the jack watered down?  Yeah.  You can go fuck yourself.  But, you know, it's my brother's place.  You know, I helped him open it.  And I went there Friday and Saturday going, oh, it'll be cool to see, you know, what it has become already. 
[00:51:30]  You know, be there from the beginning stages.  Next thing you know, I'm at the bar watching the register and watching this.  And, you know, just taking it all in, I'm like, I am officially a bar restaurant owner.  Yeah.  I'm not a silent partner, I realize.  Now you have this responsibility.  Yeah.  So, hope he'm alone.  Oh, then my other brothers are going to be like celebrity bartenders.  It's just, it's a family affair, I guess.  Well, like Elmo will go in and mix it up a little bit. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  He'll be behind the bar.  My other brother, Scott, from out east.  It's just, it's going to be crazy.  But I think the pests are going to enjoy the place.  It looks like it's going to be a cool hang already.  Yeah.  Because everyone seems to, they seem to be having a good time Friday and Saturday.  We really haven't even begun.  We just had the bar open and, like I said, a couple bands that were really good.  Let's go to Peter on Long Island.  Peter, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  I was at the bar this Saturday night.  All right.  And?  Beautiful, man.  The inside looks great. 
[00:52:30]  There was a nice crowd.  A little bit of a sausage fest.  But it was excellent.  Beautiful place.  Man, I didn't see the, I swear to God, I was going to mention that, actually.  I didn't see a lot of guys there.  I thought the crowd was pretty, pretty equal.  From what I read, yeah, there was some broads down there.  Actually, I was surprised how many women were at the place.  I was fully expecting just all guys hanging out going, but there were a lot of women that came in.  Any time it's something promoted on the Opie and Anthony show, you could expect just a dick fest. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  But the fact that there are even two or three women that show up somewhere, it's like a broad fest.  Babes all over the place.  Yeah.  Three girls.  There was a handful of cutie pies, definitely, but for the most part, a lot of dudes.  But like I said, I had a great time, man.  Very, very cool place.  You'll be back?  Absolutely.  I'm bringing a lot of extra people.  A lot of people signing up for XM.  They're like, wait a minute, where's this place?  I have a feeling it's going to be an O and A hang, I'm telling you, 
[00:53:30]  because it's going to be like some Opie and Anthony stuff on the walls,  and celebrity bartenders with my brothers, and my brother-in-law.  How far from the city is it?  The city is coming, man.  What did I get myself into?  It's Huntington.  It's like, what?  It could take you anywhere from 50 minutes to four hours.  Yeah.  It's Long Island.  You take the Long Island Expressway.  Right.  Unbelievable.  She's got a helicopter.  I want to go on a date to the FH Riley's.  We'll all go out there, Jimmy.  You need a girl.  I know.  You've got to find a girl that's willing to go out on a date. 
[00:54:00]  That's right.  And not one of those money date girls.  Who doesn't mind being waking up with leaves, Hunter?  Dessert?  How's the shallow grave here?  Yeah, but that Long Island Expressway.  Like, they spent 10 years making the road better, and it's still the exact same problems.  It's unbelievable.  It took me two and a half hours to get out there Friday.  It's enraging.  So I missed the ribbon-cutting ceremony.  I had to hang out with them.  You missed the ribbon-cutting?  That's the biggest part.  Well, and this-  Was it a big, dopey scissor? 
[00:54:30]  I don't know.  I mean, it's my brother's project.  You know, I'll be there a lot.  I'll be supporting whatever he needs.  But they do the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and then he calls me, and they're like, they  want to do it again because you weren't here.  I'm like, no, it's your place.  Well, how much time would you have taken to get there?  Like, what time was the ribbon-cutting scheduled for?  What time did you actually make it?  Like, I was like a half hour later, so.  They couldn't wait a half hour.  But then I'm talking to all these politicians, these local politicians.  And then one guy from- 
[00:55:00]  It's unbelievable.  Like I said, I'm a bar-restaurant owner.  I just simply am.  Yeah.  This guy comes up to me and goes, hey, you want to be part of the Huntington St. Paddy's  Day Parade this year?  They have this idea to get me and you, by the way.  Oh, I'm involved.  On a fucking float.  On a float.  That's going to happen.  Just waving Kiwanis Club douchebags.  I want to be in one of those little cars with a Shriners hat on, with one of those Fezzes  on. 
[00:55:30]  I don't know who those people are, but they drive those little tiny cars with the Fezz.  Yeah.  So they want us on a float this year.  No!  Waving and stuff.  I won't be on a float.  And my brother obviously knows.  He was laughing like, I just have to tell you, but I know what the answer's going to be.  Unless they make us co-Grand Marshal.  But then they're like, we want you on the float for the St. Paddy's Day Parade, but you  know, we don't want any of those crazy broads on the float with you.  Like, oh yeah, of course not.  God forbid they see any tits. 
[00:56:00]  Something I'm talking to these local politicians, and I was just like kissing ass.  Why are you shaking hands?  Just lapping it up.  We're very happy to have another new business growing.  You know, since I was elected, business has gone up 5% and shut up, who cares?  Right.  And then we had open bar for the politicians, because you've got to start off right.  That's good.  Wow, they could drink.  Yeah.  They could fucking drink, man.  What are they, are they a lot of Irish guys out on Long Island, politicians? 
[00:56:30]  What do you think?  I think they are.  What do you think?  Huntington?  Yeah.  So the place is perfect.  Irish and Italian guys?  FH Riley's.  We're not even Irish, by the way, but we'll open them.  A goddamn Irish bar.  Irish, you look Irish.  You're not Jewish, are you?  Let's go to Billy really fast here.  Billy, what's up?  Billy.  What's going on, O?  Hey.  Hey, man.  What's up, man?  Listen, I was down there on Friday and Saturday.  Just want to let you know, it was a great bar.  Your father-in-law is hysterical with the tricks.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:57:00]  Fast Eddie?  Yeah, Fast Eddie.  It's my sister's father-in-law.  He's a magician.  His sleight of hand is amazing.  Yeah, very good.  Learned a few tricks from him.  Oh, Billy, I know you.  Yeah.  We were hanging out doing car tricks for a while?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, okay.  But, yeah, blown away on what he could do.  But, yeah, the bar.  The bar is great.  Finally something new down in the village.  Cool.  Yeah, tell your friends, I think it's going to be an O.P.  and Anthony hangout, which means I won't be able to go there too often, unfortunately.  All right.  Thanks, Billy.  You got it.  Take care, guys.  All right. 
[00:57:30]  Well, what do you do in a situation where you're a bar owner like you are now, and all of a sudden,  let's see, let's say the Long Island Division of the Pagans decide they want to start, like,  hanging out.  Oh, shit.  What do you do?  Even worse, what if it becomes a gay bar?  A gay bar?  Like, if you never know, it might just, you know, hey, they make a dandy Cosmo over there  at FH Riley's.  What if it becomes a gay bar, and we have no choice because we've got to pay our bills?  Actually, they'd probably be a pretty good clientele.  Let's not even start that fucking rumor. 
[00:58:00]  A good clientele.  They're clean.  They're polite.  They like to drink with each other.  They're cordial for what I've seen.  Actually, I think it's a lipstick lesbian bar.  There you go.  You could call it Brokeback Riley's.  No?  No.  It would be a good bar.  Can you imagine that?  Your brother would be like, do you mind wearing this shirt?  He'd have, like, a little cut-off shirt for you.  Yeah, right.  A little cut-off shirt.  Also, my brother's desperate to pay his bills, and he's handing out the half shirts.  What the fuck?  You want to kiss me on the mouth? 
[00:58:30]  You know, you bring up a good point.  What do you do?  The bar owners probably don't decide.  There's a lot of bars that started out as one thing and ended up as another, I bet you.  And they didn't think it was going to go that way.  Yeah, like a biker bar.  I remember this one bar.  It was called Splinters.  You remember that place in Green Lawn?  And it was just kind of a regular community hangout bar.  And out of nowhere, bikers started showing up.  Pagans would show up.  And it was just to be in there on a Friday or a Saturday night was a fight night. 
[00:59:00]  Unless you could stay at one end of the bar and mind your own business, and still there  was a chance you were going to get hit by a cue ball or something being lobbed in there.  But I'm sure the guy that owned the bar didn't go into it going, I want a biker bar that's  going to get torn up every weekend.  You know, it's a money-making venture.  You want the best clientele you could possibly have.  But then something just happens.  And I guess you've got to keep an eye open for that.  Well, the deal with us, though, it's a restaurant first and a bar. 
[00:59:30]  Although the bar area is really cool.  But it really is a restaurant.  I think people are going to enjoy the food that my brother serves there.  I will say if bikers start showing up and you want to stop it, you just hire all fags.  You just hire men in little tiny shorts with the shirt tied off in the middle to serve  drinks.  And that will end quickly.  That's true, because usually it's the bartender that brings in the bikers.  If it's a biker chick, she's got her biker friends, and then the bikers come in.  So you look, if they've got that flat, wide ass and the fried egg tits, and they're 20 years 
[01:00:00]  old, that could be a problem.  Let's go to Kevin in Middleton.  Middletown.  Kevin, what's up?  What's up?  Are you going to allow Ranger fans in Thursday night, or is there going to be a problem with  that?  Uh, Ranger fans are welcome.  All right.  Your money's good in FH Riley's.  Even after we get into the playoffs, if we keep going and you guys are out, we'll still  be welcome.  Hey, look, man.  You know, I'm a dedicated Islander fan. 
[01:00:30]  I'll stick with a bad team just like I stick with a good team.  What can I tell you?  All right.  Good luck.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  But I'll be eating there for the first time just before the Islander Ranger game on Thursday.  Yes.  It's not my birthday, sir.  All right.  Let's say hi to Rob.  I didn't mention it.  Yeah, he did.  He did.  Rob on Long Island.  I wasn't listening again.  Don't listen.  I was watching Pell talk.  Right.  Hey, Rob.  Hey, I was hanging with you on Friday night, man.  I'm the guy with the bullet.  Oh, yeah.  What?  You were the guy that creeped out a lot of people because you were hovering over me the  entire night.  Oh, please.  I was not, man. 
[01:01:00]  By the way, I want to return your pot.  What?  Did he give you pot?  He gave me pot.  Yeah, guys assume when we're hanging out that we want a handful of pot where we are.  I could assure you, I could swear on any loved one in my family, I have not smoked pot since  the 80s.  And to this day, occasionally when we're hanging out with our listeners, hey, dude, pot.  Like, why do people assume I want weed? 
[01:01:30]  No, it wasn't like that, Anthony.  In fact, Opie was more along the lines of, oh, could me and Lindsey have some for later  on?  Really?  Has Opie taken to smoking a little weed every so often?  I wasn't creeping nobody out.  No, I'm not.  No, actually, people have been talking about you on Whack Bag.  You were hovering and creeping people out, Rob.  You got to, like, relax just slightly.  Just slightly.  I'm like a filter Paul putting fucking pictures of fucking cocks in the window of the bar  on the opening night. 
[01:02:00]  Did he really?  Yeah.  No filter Paul?  Now, listeners, that doesn't mean an occasional Vicodin slipped into my palm will be a return.  But Opie, man, I have not started smoking pot again, by the way.  No?  That is the update.  Don't want that rumor spreading?  No, my brother, my brother-in-law was making espresso martini, so I had that.  And it takes pot along with the vodka and what?  No, the espresso martinis, like, got the best on me.  Yeah?  Because they're so, like, chocolatey and coffee-ish.  It's not even like you're drinking until you fall on your face. 
[01:02:30]  All of a sudden, I was like.  Until that cop pulls you over.  Little ribbon in the bumper.  Oh, dude, I had.  I had a little patent leather buckle shoe in the grill.  Your car's all, you're, like, plowed into a seesaw.  What happened?  A little leather shoe on the windshield.  I had to hand over my keys and everything Friday.  Oh, that is horrid.  What happened?  Someone cracked my windshield with a tomato.  No.  No.  No.  I went out to see where I was parked, and the car had some red blotches on it, and there 
[01:03:00]  was a little teddy bear stuck in the grill.  Why are people putting wreaths around my driver's seat?  Jesus.  So, I had some espresso martinis.  Yeah, they are good.  Got shit-faced.  Had to hand over my keys and everything.  I was done.  Who'd you hand them to?  Lindsay.  Oh.  Was she in good shape? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah, she was in good shape.  All right.  To be honest.  Oh, my God.  Is Lindsay in good shape?  Oh, my God.  Opie, I got to tell you, man.  You know what?  I don't.  What happened?  A callback show.  There was a disconnection.  He was going to compliment your girl.  Yeah.  All right, Rob.  Relax.  Hey, you got to watch on HBO Family.  They had another retard thing, man, called Graduating Peter.  It was better than a week.  Oh, by the way, that wasn't a dump out.  I just threw them on hold.  But, um, so, the espresso martinis, like you said, they're chocolatey, and they taste like coffee. 
[01:04:00]  You don't think you're really drinking.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, it hits you.  Rob, where'd you go?  You're snotted.  Oh.  And then I asked him for pot, and I swear to God, I still haven't smoked pot in over 10 years.  Why?  You must have been drunk.  That's what I'm saying.  Why would you ask someone for pot?  Because then I woke up the next day, and Lindsay goes, um, you realize that, uh, you got, like, pot last night.  And I had to think about it.  I'm like, oh, my God, I did.  I did.  I was handed a canister of pot. 
[01:04:30]  How much pot?  Yeah, this guy, just enough.  Like for how many joints?  I don't know.  Probably a joint.  Probably a joint.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's it?  So that was the closest I came to, uh, no, and that's the truth.  That's the closest I came to smoking pot for the first time in, like, 10 years.  Now, what was going through your mind when you asked him for pot?  You must have had a scenario to when and where you were going to smoke this the first time in 10 years.  I don't know.  I didn't think it out.  Were you doing it that night?  No.  I'm not, no, no way. 
[01:05:00]  No?  I'm thinking more maybe next time I'm on vacation, maybe.  You go down, but then you got to take it with you to the Bahamas.  Right.  You don't have a penalty for that to travel with drugs.  I want to go to Turkey and smuggle some, uh, hashback.  I'm not going to be, uh, carrying pot anytime soon.  I don't know.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I was feeling happy.  My brother's place was finally open.  The drinks was strong.  The listeners were there supporting.  You figured pot has to be involved somehow.  And I just was feeling good.  And next thing you know, I'm asking for pot.  Wow.  It was a good buzz. 
[01:05:30]  That's odd.  It's a buzz I haven't seen in a while.  Let's just put it that way.  It was a really good buzz.  Absolutely.  Someone said they saw you later on, uh, in the back alley tied off and shooting something  in your arm.  Just for the hell of it.  Swallowing balloons before getting on a plane.  He's a mule.  But the reason I had Rob call, he was in the army.  He knows your brother too.  He was in the army with your brother, I guess.  Wow.  And the guy is such a creep and a huge fan of the show.  And, uh, and he has some fine pot, by the way. 
[01:06:00]  You can tell by the smell.  Yeah.  Um, he, he carries around a bullet that supposedly was supposed to kill him.  It's a great story.  Unless he's like bullshitting.  Where was it fired?  I don't know.  I, I, he's got to call in, but he was.  My brother wasn't in the army during any active duty.  Like there wasn't really any war going on.  Another reason why I wanted him to call in.  I wanted to see if his story was bullshit or not.  He's got the, he's got this, uh, bullet.  It hit my Bible.  And supposedly he was in a confrontation. 
[01:06:30]  Guy jumps up, an older soldier aims the gun at him.  It doesn't go off.  All right.  And then he says how he blew this guy's head off and then took the bullet out of the gun.  And, and there's markings on it where it jammed in the gun.  Supposedly.  I think he's a liar.  And now he just, he walks around every day with this bullet in his pocket.  And then we'll tell anyone who'll, who'll listen.  He sounds like a real ass and a liar.  He shot the other soldier and he's still walking around.  They were arguing and he just shot another soldier. 
[01:07:00]  That doesn't make sense.  Was it in combat?  No, there was some kind of conference.  Yeah, it was the, there was the combat going on.  It was during, um.  Granada?  I believe, uh, 79, 80, 81.  So it was, um, I know there's a lot of shit going on in Iran at the time, uh, with the hostages, but.  Maybe it was after your brother left the army.  I don't know.  Because I know my brother would.  Oh, here he is.  He got lucky.  All right.  Rob.  Yeah.  No one's buying your bullet story. 
[01:07:30]  Your bullshit story.  This was, this was in the 80s.  I was in Honduras during a time when the Sandinistas and the Contras were.  We were having their little thing.  We were on patrol.  And.  That wasn't really a sanctioned event, was it?  No, we, we, let's just say that this is one of the little things that our government does that you never really hear about.  One of those things Reagan, uh, didn't, uh, remember?  Exactly.  All right.  And, uh, basically, long story.  Secret agent.  I'm on patrol.  An AK-47 barrel comes out of the bushes. 
[01:08:00]  It goes click, which is something very rare for an AK-47 to do.  Uh, basically, I was kind of shocked.  I, I basically pretty much did a full metal jacket, dropped my weapon, pulled my side arm out, and shot him, emptied the weapon pretty much into his face.  Uh, after everything was over with, um, we, we just, uh, we did an after action thing.  And I picked up his AK, and I tried pulling the bolt back, and I couldn't.  And when I, when I tried pulling the bolt back after several minutes, it finally slid free, and the bullet that came out, I showed it to Opie, the extractor, on the bolt, just messed the bullet all up. 
[01:08:30]  But that one was in the chamber.  It was meant for me.  Well, there you go.  That's the bullet story.  Um.  Hold on.  Jeff is saying that this story sounds very familiar.  Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff.  Hi.  Hey, how are you, guys?  Hey, man.  It's Steve from home.  He made out of fire with Denzel Washington.  He went to kill himself, and, uh, the bullet jammed.  He took the bullet out, and they said the bullet never lives, and he carried it around with him. 
[01:09:00]  And what's that from?  About man on fire with Denzel Washington.  Okay, uh, uh, sir?  No, that's, that's, that's not the way it happened with me, and for an AK to do that, what, what, what happened was, when we examined the magazine, the guy had modified the spring in the magazine, so it actually kind of double fed up in there.  Right.  Which is, it's rare.  This is what told me, this is what tells me this guy's lying.  Because he said something, this is something that you say when you're lying. 
[01:09:30]  This is the type of thing, like, the government counterfeits their own money.  Like, that's the same thing when he goes, government does a lot of stuff.  It's just one of the things that you just don't know about.  Jimmy, I got pictures of it.  Crazy, kind of crazy people usually are involved in the government at some point.  Exactly.  And usually it's a secretive thing.  I'm not saying you are, Chris.  Sir, I'm not saying you're, well, did we have, like, we had advisors down there.  We weren't deployed down in Honduras.  But we, but we do have a base of operations in Honduras.  Considering I'm going to see, Rob.  Yeah, but they weren't going out on patrols. 
[01:10:00]  Like, what, what type of things were you doing that?  Well, I don't even think you were allowed to take your rifle out with you as an advisor.  I was in communications, and we supported an infantry unit.  And once in a while, the infantry units would go out on patrol and take us with them.  What infantry?  We'd have a radio on your back.  What infantry?  Their infantry?  Well, you had the Honduran army and a mix of our guys also.  A mix of your guys.  There was nothing, there was supposed to be nothing but advisors down there. 
[01:10:30]  Well, Anthony, what, what, what actually goes on and what, what told on TV.  Can I jump in for a second?  Let's told on the Opie and Anthony show.  Can I jump in because he told me the story?  Yeah.  Considering I'm going to see, uh, bullet Rob.  Oh.  Quite often at FH Riley's in Huntington.  Thank you.  I believe every word of his story.  Listen.  Oh, man.  I'm telling you.  Rob, remember.  Opie believes you.  Hey, you know what?  Anthony, who probably will never show up at FH Riley's, he doesn't believe you.  I will show up indeed. 
[01:11:00]  Not only will I show up at FH Riley's, but I don't believe you and I'll shoot you in the face.  You know what?  That's a compliment coming from you, Jimmy, man.  I love you, bro.  Thank you, man.  And bullet Rob, how strong is this pot that you gave me?  It's pretty good, man.  It's pretty good.  It'll get you nice and buzzed.  Actually, Lindsey was the one that took it, not you.  Is it kind, bud?  It's very kind, bud.  He used the dead guy as fertilizer for this pot, though.  So it's really good.  Yeah, well, you know, what can I tell you, man? 
[01:11:30]  I try.  All right, hold on.  Now we're on to a whole different thing.  It started off with the restaurant talk, but we got some interesting stuff going on now.  Ben's raw ass first.  Go.  Hey, boys.  Great restaurant.  Hey, that guy, he was the guy with the General Ramon shirt, right?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  This guy, I'm telling you, he had a story for everything.  I mean, he had dewee stories.  I heard that bullet story, and I kind of think it's Bravo Sierra.  Oh, Bravo Sierra. 
[01:12:00]  You know what?  He was such a nice guy the other night at the bar and shit.  You know, now all of a sudden, I'm a creep.  Hey, you know what?  I don't care, but I love you guys anyway.  Hold on.  I didn't say you were a creep.  Hey, hold on now.  Wait a minute now.  Wait a minute.  I am.  Rob, you've got to understand the show.  You've got to take a couple lumps.  Absolutely.  So what?  You created a story just to be interesting in a bar, and now it's being called out in front of two countries.  I didn't say that.  Big deal.  So what?  This one thing that you've held on to that made you interesting is now being proven fraudulent. 
[01:12:30]  It's not important.  Rob, hold on a minute, Rob.  You're all right.  Hey, thank you.  I appreciate it.  Hey, dude.  How long of a flight was Honduras?  How long of a what?  A flight was Honduras from here.  From here?  Yeah.  I took it from Fort Bragg, and it was about, I don't know, maybe an hour and a half, two hours.  You're on a plane, man.  You sleep, you know?  I was a paratrooper.  We didn't jump or anything like that.  Honduras is an hour and a half, two hour flight?  You didn't jump in?  Is that true?  No, we didn't jump in.  We jumped into Panama, though.  That was some shit. 
[01:13:00]  All right, hold on.  This guy's going to prove his point.  Paul in Florida.  Paul?  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Hey.  All right.  This guy says he's up from Fort Bragg.  Okay, I can buy that.  What unit were you with that went down to the Honduras?  I was in the 50th Signal Battalion, 36th Signal Brigade, airborne.  You were in a Signal Battalion?  Signal Battalion doesn't go on patrol, dude.  Dude, I was supporting the infantry.  Okay, which infantry battalion were you supporting?  We were actually supporting the 82nd Airborne's, uh, what fucking unit was it? 
[01:13:30]  It was the 2nd Battalion of the 173rd Infantry Airborne.  Dude, you're out of your mind because that unit was deactivated after Vietnam.  Wrong answer, pal.  Wrong answer.  Wrong answer.  Wrong answer.  Dude, the unit, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  The unit that was there was the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment.  I know because I was there. 
[01:14:00]  I was with the 504th.  I came in in 88, and there was a big old thing, and it'll teach you about the history of the unit  that you're in.  They'll tell you all the conflicts and places that they've deployed to, okay?  The 173rd was deactivated after Vietnam was just recently reactivated right before Iraq  the second time around.  Uh-oh.  It was reactivated during Desert Storm, my friend.  No, it was not.  It was reactivated during Desert Storm.  Yeah, but Desert Storm was in 1990.  Way after Honduras.  That's still after.  It was also reactivated in 1991.  This won't end good. 
[01:14:30]  Dude, dude, you're talking to a former Green Bean.  Uh-oh, they're shooting at each other.  Oh, no.  Look out.  Everybody get down.  Get down.  Hey, how would it work like this?  I was doing the first Iraq war, dude.  It was not in Desert Storm.  I hate to break your bubble, dude, but it wasn't.  I was in Desert Storm.  The 173rd was not there.  All right.  Thanks, Paul.  But they were an active unit.  All right.  Look, I'm at work.  I got to deliver this boiler, man.  I got to go.  But look, I appreciate you guys' show.  I love you guys. 
[01:15:00]  You guys make my life easier every single day.  Deliver the boiler.  There are people waiting on you.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  Sitting around doing nothing.  All right.  Pat in Philly.  Yeah, boys.  That guy is totally full of shit.  Yeah?  Yeah, I was a Marine.  AK-47 is an open bolt weapon.  You don't chamber rounds on it.  The bolt fire is from the rear.  All right.  Now everybody will get their...  But I still don't know what that means.  This is what happens when men talk about weapons. 
[01:15:30]  I don't know who's right.  I believe Rob and his story.  Of course you do, Opie.  What the hell did I get myself into?  We'll see next time.  It was interesting, though, because, like, you know,  obviously a lot of people are going there because of the show  and they have no problem talking with each other,  which is so different than a lot of bars, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Because you usually go in and you just talk to the people you go in with.  Whether it's real or bullshit, they have no trouble talking to each other.  And then you realize that people not talking is okay sometimes.  Yeah.  Dude, this was shot at me in high...  Was it?  Really? 
[01:16:00]  All right.  So it's FH Riley's.  We're open for business.  It is more a restaurant than a bar, but the bar crowd looks like it's going to be okay, too.  Start serving food sometime this week.  I'll be there Thursday.  And Opie says, all bikers are welcome.  Fly your colors.  And faggots.  No faggots.  If you're tempted to order an apple martini, stay home.  Fucking mule juice drinker.  We named this bar and restaurant after my dad, so no faggots.  What is the H?  I figured the F was...  What's the H? 
[01:16:30]  Hughes.  Oh, Jesus.  Fred Hughes.  And, you know, it's kind of...  Patrice was making fun of the name because, like, we're not Irish and we're opening up  an Irish place.  I mean, we're this much Irish.  So Patrice is just killing me.  I'm like, oh, great.  FH Riley stands for Fred Hughes, FH.  And Riley was the last grandkid he got to hold before he died in the fiery car wreck.  And Patrice just went, oh, shit.  I can't even joke about that shit.  Got a whole pissed because he couldn't joke about it.  So it's 400 New York Avenue in Huntington. 
[01:17:00]  All right.  FH Riley's.  Thanks for the support so far.  All right.  We'll take a break.  We'll get into some stuff next.  Stay there.  I just went to the bathroom with one of the 2020 guys.  Nice.  Did they get any video?  Just a little small talk, which is weird.  We have the only bathroom in America where guys could have small talk and it's normal. 
[01:17:30]  You say that.  I talk to no one.  I go in a stall.  Well, that's weird in itself that you have to take a leak in a stall.  I don't want to intimidate everybody.  I don't want to intimidate everybody.  They feel bad about themselves.  They look down at me.  They go, oh, that's what a big one looks like.  Well, you know what it is, too?  It's small talk because we're doing a radio show, barely any commercials, so it's almost  like we all have to take leaks because we have tiny bladders, so we all run into the  bathroom, and then it's like, Ben, how's the show sounding? 
[01:18:00]  Jimmy, blah, blah, blah.  It's just all dumb stuff that you need to ask as we're in break.  Yeah.  And we can't do it because we all have to take leaks, so it happens in there, hence  the small talk.  Small talk in the bathroom.  We have the only bathroom in America that guys can go in and have small talk, and it's  completely normal because we have nowhere else to talk.  So I was talking to the 2020 guy, like, hey, how's it going?  You getting good stuff?  Like, I don't care.  I'm just making conversation. 
[01:18:30]  Piss going nice.  He goes, you guys have a really funny show, but we're not going to be able to use any of  this on 2020.  Why?  Of course not.  Because there's a lot of cursing and the subject matter.  I'm sure they'll use some of it.  They only need a couple minutes out of a four-hour shoot.  Just a video, quickly, like, going by, and then a voiceover.  We can't even air what we've recorded here for 2020.  This is how filthy the show was.  Right.  Or maybe they'll use bleeps. 
[01:19:00]  I don't know.  Maybe they could, you know, bleep.  Pixelate our mouth.  They have to bleep.  It's about cursing.  Yeah.  It's about being rude and cursing.  Have you been cursing more than normal?  Fuck no.  I did at the beginning of the show, if you noticed.  I cursed a little, thinking it might get me a little more time, you know?  You really want time on this fucking piece.  I just, if they're here, you know, I might as well utilize that and try to get a little  time, Opie.  I gave up on that stuff.  So I said fuck a couple of times.  I swear to God, I gave up on all that a long time ago.  It's a good word.  Because we used to try so hard in the beginning of our careers. 
[01:19:30]  Oh, I know.  They would come in and film stuff and you go, they were here for four hours and they  used that five second piece?  Yeah.  So now it's just like, just fucking do the show.  Oh, oh, I got a question.  What?  Whose phone was under my seat?  There is a mystery phone that was under the driver's seat of my vehicle.  Did Master Poe lose his phone?  I tried opening it up.  It was not charged, so I charged it up and I opened it and you need a code to unlock 
[01:20:00]  the keyboard of the phone.  Why would there be a mystery phone under your seat?  I don't know.  It's either Poe or Garage Guy because I'm the only one that drives my vehicle.  Did you lose your phone?  Did you lose your phone at any point, Poe?  No, sir.  No, you did not.  All right.  Thank you.  Oh, shit. 
[01:20:30]  Wait, no, no, wait, wait, wait, Poe, Poe, Poe.  Wow.  Like, I have never seen a rooter dismissal.  No offense to Poe, but he has a very slow delivery, and sometimes that just brings down the energy  of the show.  Slow with the voice, fast with the fist.  Sometimes it takes him a minute just to get headphones on.  But he was going to tell the story.  There's no story if it says it's not his phone. 
[01:21:00]  If it's not his phone, then it's not his phone.  That's probably accurate.  All right.  Is that your phone?  Well, it's not.  All right.  Take care.  Bye.  And why is a lot of people...  Thank you.  Thank you.  Why are a lot of people applauding me knowing that Master Poe can't see that they're applauding  me?  Who's fan?  Nothing against Master Poe.  He knows that.  But he has a tendency to take his time when he comes into the studio and set up his headphones.  And it's like, oh my God, it's just a quick question.  Gentlemen, I had a phone.  I still possess said telephone. 
[01:21:30]  There was no loss in my equipment, in my phone, or my telephone service.  This is a very good example of what we had to endure.  So just know.  Hey, Ben told me to come in here and defend myself.  What's going on?  I agree.  You don't have to defend yourself.  I completely agree.  Poe, nothing against you personally, but there are times you take your time when you come  in here.  And there's an energy that we're trying to, you know, keep going.  Maintain.  I agree.  It's been a long time.  Sometimes you take your time just getting the headphones on. 
[01:22:00]  Poe is like Kane from Kung Fu, though, Opie.  That's great.  It's the slow talking, slow moving.  But then when actually in Kung Fu, when you're down.  That's wonderful when you're taking on seven...  Ninjas.  Marauders.  Marauders.  Seven marauders.  But we're at Stock Jocks trying to do an entertaining radio show.  Right.  Where we have to keep our energy up.  Well, from now on, I'll jump in here.  I'll do a dive roll and put the earphones on. 
[01:22:30]  That would be kind of cool.  That would rock.  But it wasn't your phone.  No, it wasn't.  Now, any suggestions, perhaps, because I drive from the garage to my house, from my house  to the garage.  Any suggestions as to whose it might be?  Was, like, maybe...  Did anyone else ever drive my vehicle there?  No.  I think Poe's letting people drive you a truck.  No.  A garage...  Maybe a garage guy, then.  Could be the garage guy that pulls it into the spot.  Well, if you're getting phone calls from bill collectors and shit, you probably know this. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah, I'll check that.  I'll check...  But I can't, because I can't punch the code in.  No, I have two phones.  Which sucks.  I have two phones, and I didn't lose any.  And you have both of them.  Yeah.  Okay, Poe.  Thank you very much.  All right.  I'll do the backflip also.  No, let's flip out.  All right.  Thank you.  Let's go to Raphael in Connecticut.  We have an update.  This is Raphael.  Raphael.  What's going on, gentlemen?  Jim Norton's back from Hollywood, so tell him personally why you're calling the program,  because he doesn't know.  I am calling the program because this Thursday, coming up, live on the Opie and Anthony show, 
[01:23:30]  will be the Super Ball.  We're doing a Super Ball on Thursday.  Super Ball.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, it sounds like ball, but it's not.  Can we call it that, or is it a copyright infringement?  We have to call it the big sack?  The big game?  Or something?  Raphael will be taking mousetraps to his scrotum this Thursday.  He's taking on Matt.  Yeah, I think that's his name.  Matt took Raphael's idea.  Stole it. 
[01:24:00]  Stole Raphael.  Raphael called up and said, I will take a mousetrap to my ball bag, but I'm in Connecticut.  I can't get there today.  Right?  So we set up for him to come in sometime this week.  Matt said, fuck that.  I'm close, and I'll take Raphael's idea.  Do it.  Get all the credit.  Get the video up on the internet.  And now it's being downloaded all over the world.  Yeah.  So Raphael's not too happy about that, so he called Matt out, and they're going to have  a Super Bowl off this Thursday on the program.  Now, the rules for this are still a little shady, but we're figuring like a decathlon of 
[01:24:30]  your testicles.  Some type of different events for your balls.  Didn't we decide that these guys have to come in with their own torture devices?  Their own creativity, figure out some type of torture for your nutsack.  I got the idea.  What is it?  Bug spraying a lighter on the balls.  Like burning it a little bit.  You know, you spray it with like rain or something like that, and then you just fucking hold a 
[01:25:00]  lighter under it and just watch it go up.  All right.  That would win, probably.  But in the end, did you really win?  Yeah.  I say no.  And who gets to sweep up the balls after the contest is over?  Gets to blow it out?  Yeah.  Me.  Raphael, what do you have in store for your balls on Thursday?  Well, I bought a case of the mouse glue traps.  Okay.  Glue trap.  Now, I've seen mice caught in these things.  They're pretty, they look pretty uncomfortable sitting there. 
[01:25:30]  You will lose skin.  When you try to take it off?  Absolutely will lose skin.  He's going to slam his nutsack into a glue trap.  It's radio gold, though.  And then you're going to rip it off like it's a fruit roll-up?  Yes.  Wow.  All right, so you got that.  Any other ideas?  Well, the mousetraps.  Yeah.  Of course, the mousetraps.  But I'm limited to what I could bring on the train for possible random inspections. 
[01:26:00]  Why?  Now, could the terrorists really be interfering with our nutsack derby here that we're trying to pull off?  I say you bring a nail, a hammer, and a two-by-four.  Crucify myself, huh?  Oh.  What are we giving away?  You win a trip to the emergency room and six years of counseling.  What's the prize?  Just bragging rights.  Oh.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's not about the prize, Jimmy. 
[01:26:30]  Good point, boys.  Good point.  It's just bragging rights.  All right, so he's going to, the idea for Super Bowl right here from Schwuggy.  Schwuggy.  Charles, what's going on?  What's up?  Hey, for Cringe Factor, the best thing would be, and I know this is a ripoff from Jackass the movie,  but paper cuts on the head and the sack.  Hey, geez.  Okay, hold on.  I can't even get it.  What, right across the hole?  Right, exactly.  For Cringe Factor.  But it's a ripoff.  Hey, guys, real quickly.  I've been a listener since the second week of WNEW.  And the last couple weeks have been some of the best radio you guys have ever done.  Oh, thank you. 
[01:27:00]  How tall are you, Schwug?  He's got that voice.  The big giant guy voice?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I was a normal kid until about four years old, and then my parents noticed  I was starting to get bigger.  If you look at my class picture here, I'll show you.  I'm in the back row, always in the back row.  That's me.  And then I really shot up and had another growth spurt in sixth grade.  Actually, you see here, I'm bigger than my teacher, and he was a basketball player. 
[01:27:30]  Again, in the back row, I'm crouching down because the ceiling was very low for the children.  And you have some kind of gland.  My pituitary gland wouldn't stop secreting.  Right.  So I just kept growing.  The voice?  No idea why we all sound like this.  But I'm huge and giant.  Here's me when I was in college.  I'm on the lacrosse team, and I look really ridiculous holding this little lacrosse stick.  Those guys take more pictures than normal people. 
[01:28:00]  They got their whole life, like, spelt out in photos.  Here's, oh, yeah.  Oh, this was an important, fun, great day for me.  A prom.  Here's me at prom, pinning a corsage onto my date's dress.  You could see the horrified father behind me, hoping this genetic mess doesn't foul his little girl. 
[01:28:30]  A lot of people suggesting piercings to the sacks on Thursday.  Here's the time I went camping and was followed by some people that actually poured plaster into my footprints and took them home.  I don't know why to this day.  All right, Raphael.  We'll see you Thursday, okay?  Opie, I'm down for piercing the sack.  Well, then bring in the...  He's down for piercing the sack.  With what?  Bring that stuff in.  I'm down for that.  Safety pin.  There's... 
[01:29:00]  Safety pin and a lighter.  You know what would be great to do?  Like, take the corner of paper.  Not a paper cup, but the corner.  And open the cock hole and just poke the corner into the cock hole.  I won't listen.  All right, Raphael.  We'll see you Thursday.  We haven't heard from Matt.  Wow, I just poked that soft skin.  Maybe if Matt's listening, he could make sure that he calls the show so we know we have game on on Thursday.  Yeah, so either way, I'll come down and I'll do it.  All right, thanks, Raphael.  Do you know what a dominatrix told me she did one time, what she could do for this contest?  She said some guy, he was like jacking off, and she put a doctor's thing. 
[01:29:30]  What do they cut with?  A scalpel.  The very tip of a scalpel.  Wait, hold on.  This is in the penis head, and this is true.  And as he was about to ejaculate, he had her yank it out so it cut him a little bit inside.  Get out of here.  And this way for the next couple days, he was a doctor.  But the next couple days when he whizzed, he felt like that little burn and remembered the spirit.  A little burn, you'd feel a lot of burn.  Well, it was just a little, whatever it was, yeah.  It was just the tip of the scalpel in the cock hole. 
[01:30:00]  Kurt in Florida.  Kurt?  Yeah, I had two ideas.  A block of ice and hot soup.  Go from one to the other.  Have them sit on a block of ice with their ball bags?  Yeah, and then dip it in a boiling hot soup.  All right.  You know what?  I think it's going to be up to these guys.  They come in with their torture devices, and we'll have a ball off, and we'll see what happens.  Okay?  All right.  We should move on.  We got some great audio of some of the guys from Brokeback Mountain on Oprah Winfrey. 
[01:30:30]  Before we do that, I have a quick question for any psychologists out there.  I had a dream last night.  Very brief.  This is, I don't know what it means.  I was walking through a-  It's gay, by the way.  No, it's not.  I was walking through a carnival atmosphere with Patrick from Cringe Humor.  Uh-huh.  And all of a sudden, we're like standing on this, it was like, picture like a bunch of  like scaffolding.  Mm-hmm.  And people on every row of the scaffolding, and we're on the top portion of the scaffolding.  Everybody's jumping up and down the scaffolding.  Yeah.  And we're right near like a mountain ridge, and then we realize that the scaffolding was 
[01:31:00]  being held up by Than with his tongue.  He was holding the scaffolding up.  I don't know what-  We had a whole bunch of scaffolding.  I don't know what it means.  Bunch of levels of people.  Yeah.  You're on the top level.  With Patrick, yeah.  With Patrick from Cringe Humor.  Yeah.  And Than is holding the whole rigmarole up-  With his tongue.  With his tongue.  Yeah.  And then I jumped back off the scaffolding onto like the mountain ledge and got away from  it.  Let me see-  Did it fall?  No, I don't remember.  Let me see if it's in my dream book. 
[01:31:30]  Let me see that.  Donuts, hot dogs, dreams for every-  Yep.  Says you're a faggot.  No.  That is gay.  No, it's not.  It's a gay dream.  Look, you fancy yourself better than everybody else.  That's why you're on the top of the level.  You're better than everybody.  I like it.  Everyone else is below you.  I like it.  Right.  That's your importance level that you're feeling.  Uh-huh.  The Than and his tongue thing is a young up-and-coming talent like Than and his sharp wit of his tongue 
[01:32:00]  has you precariously perched on top because you're threatened that any- at any time somebody  can dethrone you-  Right.  Can come up.  There's other people that are not quite as high up on the ladder yet that can kind of  throw you off.  I think you're not-  It's your insecurities.  It's your insecurities.  Yeah.  Your insecurities, I think. 
[01:32:30]  Not in control of your own destiny.  But why Patrick?  I have no idea.  He shouldn't have been up there with you.  He's not top of the-  No.  I'm top of the-  Not top of the-  I think that's more insecurity that even though you're on top, you're not as high up as you  want to be because you just look over and look who's with you still.  I'm just happy I'm not a faggot.  Thank God.  I'm an insecure man.  I wasn't done yet.  No, that was it.  Thank God I'm not a homo.  There's something gay in there.  No, there's not.  At the end of the thing, I was like-  You're not telling all.  No, really.  That is the whole thing.  We're walking through a carnival.  Yeah.  And that was all it was.  A carnival is the fun and excitement that is your life. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Me and Patrick, we went through a tunnel-  Tunnel of love?  Yeah.  Tunnel of love?  Tunnel of love, the whole thing.  We were on the scaffolding.  You were shaped like a penis.  I fell and my asshole caught in his mouth and then we just jumped away.  No, I'm glad.  That makes pretty good sense.  Thanks.  I feel better now.  I thought I was a mo.  It's not gay.  No.  Good.  I'm sure there's a lady out there that'll look it up in a dream book for you.  Yeah.  All right.  Broke back men on Oprah.  Anthony saw a broke back mountain.  I know.  You want to-  I saw it in the comfort of my own home. 
[01:33:30]  Steve saw it.  Thanks to certain people.  Really?  That's surprising.  Steve with his wife.  Right.  He said he was dragged to the movie and we all had to look away like, all right, we'll make  believe we believe you.  Was he probably criticizing the whole thing?  That's not the way it normally happens.  My wife, George Glass.  He said he had no choice.  He was dragged and we started looking out the window like, yeah, man.  Cool.  Really, Steve?  Two movies he's been dragged to in the last 20 years.  Broke back mountain and cruising.  Fucking mo. 
[01:34:00]  Stop renting dog day afternoon because you approve of the relationship.  It was a fine movie.  There was nothing wrong with it.  It wasn't action packed.  It was a long love story type movie.  But for that type of movie, the acting was good.  I hear it's very slow moving.  Some of the scenes, a little shocking for a guy to sit and watch.  You automatically cringe at those kissing scenes and stuff.  But direction was great and cinematography. 
[01:34:30]  I have to disagree with the direction.  Sweeping and wonderful.  Why?  Because if the camera's on one guy's mouth and another guy's mouth is then in the same shot,  that's poor directing as far as I'm concerned.  There was one point where they're making out and they separate and there's that spit line  between two men's lips, whiskers.  Speaking of making out, this is going off on a tangent.  It better be.  Did you see Flavor of Love last night?  No.  Are you watching the Flavor of Love on VH1?  No, I'm not. 
[01:35:00]  Can't get enough of that.  But there's a scene where Flavor Flav is making out with one of the hosts.  Yeah.  This chick named New York.  And I don't know.  Is it a black thing where you have to use your tongue when you're kissing?  I'm not talking about it.  Wait, what?  No, no, no.  I'm not.  All right.  You better hear about that a little better.  I'm not talking the basic way where you use your tongue,  where the tongue is now outside your mouth licking the other person as you're kissing.  Like licking their chin or their-  All around the mouth.  It has to be a black thing. 
[01:35:30]  I got to ask Patrice.  I've never seen that before in my life.  I don't know.  What does he know about human intimacy?  Yeah, right?  How do you degrade a prostitute?  That he can tell you.  How do you kiss and look each other's eyes?  He's fucking finished.  Mr. Camo.  Watch it.  I mean, they run it every other hour, so check it out for yourself.  But there's something going on with black people kissing with the tongue that's completely  out of their mouth, like licking and kissing at the same time.  Hmm.  Well, I'm sure-  And it was deeply disturbing.  I'm sure our listeners will have eight billion racist responses to that. 
[01:36:00]  So anyway, getting back to Brokeback Mountain and the kissing scene and the-  Yeah, a little alarming as a guy, it makes you cringe any time.  You could, if as a goof, we've said this in the past, if as a goof, you know, someone pops  in a porno, gay porno, to see like a guy slamming another guy up the ass isn't half  as disturbing as watching two guys intimate and like spooning as they sleep.  And the sensitive face touch or kiss is so much more disturbing than just pornography. 
[01:36:30]  You know what?  I'm going to take issue with that.  I have more problem with a cock being slammed up my ass than I would spooning.  I never used the word my.  I was talking about visually watching it.  I got to ask you something.  Sure.  And I want a real answer.  Yes.  You're an actor now.  You're on HBO series and all that, okay?  Right?  Would you do a movie like Brokeback Mountain? 
[01:37:00]  Like, I don't get it as an actor.  Do you want to talk about the biggest faggot response ever?  My first thing was, who's the co-star?  That is a faggot response.  Who's the co-star?  Don't Seymour Hoffman?  All right.  I respect him.  You're now officially an actor.  You really are.  You're going to be on this huge HBO show.  Now you're going to probably get offered other things.  Like, where is the line as an actor?  And I'm being dead serious here.  You can have fun with this all you want, but I don't get it. 
[01:37:30]  And even comedic scenes, they do that guy-on-guy kissing as like a comedic thing.  Where?  I've seen that in.  You've seen it on SNL every once in a while.  Yeah, yeah, SNL.  I don't know.  Didn't Ben Stiller do it once or?  That would be a very tough one to pull off.  Chris Kattan has done it a hundred times.  Well.  Jesus.  I heard that Will Smith wouldn't do it in Six Degrees of Separation.  They wanted him to kiss and he wouldn't.  Pacino would not do any scenes, I believe.  There was like a weird thing when we did Doggy the Afternoon.  There's certain scenes he wouldn't do, like with the guy or some shit like that. 
[01:38:00]  So I think he wouldn't do any scenes with Leon, the gay guy.  Right.  The other gay guy.  But these guys are going at it in Brokeback Mountain.  Yeah, I don't know how to do that.  They're as hetero as hetero can be.  Who are they?  What are their names?  Who are those I know?  It's Jake.  Jake Millen Hall.  Okay, and Heath Ledger.  And Heath Ledger, yeah.  Jake Gillen.  Gillen Hall.  Gillen Hall.  Whatever.  That'd be a tough one to pull off.  It'd be even tougher for the other actor.  Who, if he's asking, here's the guy, it has to be me.  Well, here's a movie that, how rejected would you feel? 
[01:38:30]  I know.  The guy's like, you know something, anyone but this guy.  My fat neck.  He's going to touch my fucking side fat.  And then, you know, one of the actors is doing it better than the other guy.  And like, wow.  How did you?  And cut.  Right.  Keep going.  You keep going for a split second more.  Like, I don't get what goes through your mind as an actor to take on that role.  I don't.  I think.  Do you want to be a star that bad?  Like, is it about your art that bad?  Like, actors, actors are strange people. 
[01:39:00]  They're different than normal people.  They really, some of them really get into these roles.  You talk to other people.  I've talked to other people that have worked with, you know, great actors.  I've never talked with a great actor, but I've talked to people that work with them.  You certainly have.  And they say they really get themselves into these roles.  They convince themselves that they are these people.  They try to, like, live their life during the term of the shooting as that person.  And somehow they're able to do that and then walk away from it, and they're back to being themselves again. 
[01:39:30]  Those are method actors, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  Hoffman said it was very hard to come out of Rain Man.  That was what I heard.  He said he had a tough time with that one, coming out of that one.  A ball-peen hammer to the head.  I would suggest that to come out of a role, you fucking self-important douchebag.  Well, those guys are doing it like, but you look at how well he does it.  When you look at someone like Dustin Hoffman, how the fuck are you that good at doing this?  Like, you can't just snap, cameras on, do it.  You've got to continue the character. 
[01:40:00]  I can, but they can't.  I mean, it's got to be hard for a lot of the tours.  How are you so good at it?  There's got to be a fucking weird thing that make you so good.  Like, I'd love to know what Philip Seymour Hoffman does to do his shit.  It's so funny you just brought that up, because the last couple weeks they've been filming  a John Lennon movie up in the hood, where I live.  And what's his name?  Jared Leto is playing Mark David Chapman.  Oh.  Now, would you do a love scene with Jared Leto?  Which one's Jared Leto?  I don't know the name.  That's very cute.  He was in Requiem for...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I went out of respect, probably, just because he's a good actor.  Right?  Only with a severed arm, though. 
[01:40:30]  So there's a couple things going on here.  He gained weight for the role, because we were talking about that earlier.  And he's playing Mark David Chapman, and he's walking around with an album.  And in between scenes, he's still in character.  And you almost feel like, holy crap, it's bringing you back to 1980 when Lennon was shot.  A little weird.  And they're filming it right outside the Dakota, or they were.  And he's on the sidewalk, rocking back and forth in between scenes, and no one was talking  to him or anything.  I guess it's easier to do it that way.  It's easier, instead of snapping it on, off, out of character, into character, if you 
[01:41:00]  stay in the character, then you don't have to get back into it when they start rolling  on.  It was really creepy to watch.  Yeah.  Because he really looked like Mark David Chapman with the makeup and the glasses and the hair  and the weight that he gave.  Creepy.  Holding the album and just sitting on the sidewalk, just talking to himself and rocking and doing  all sorts of crazy stuff.  Well, Louis C.K., who used to write for Conan, told a story about what he called Martin Sheen.  They were doing something with Martin Sheen.  And Martin Sheen was doing some movie about General Lee. 
[01:41:30]  The self-important ass.  Well, he's still a good actor.  I think it was, yeah, that Civil War movie, the sequel.  I was a sequel to some movie, and I fucking forgot it, and I stink.  Oh, no, that's all right.  God, I hate that.  We all forget it.  Cut it out.  And he called Martin Sheen, and he was in character.  He said he would talk to him on the phone, but he was talking as General Lee.  Yeah.  He was kind of, guys, do that.  I don't.  I'm out of character.  As soon as the camera stops.  Gods and Generals from Derek?  Gods and Generals.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But it's the sequel to... 
[01:42:00]  The sequel to...  Gettysburg.  Gettysburg.  Gettysburg.  There you go.  Glad I sidetracked on that fucking dead-end point.  Oh, I know.  But that's the only example I have of a guy being out of character.  Although they said it doesn't happen when he was doing Midnight Cowboy.  He would run into restaurants dressed horribly, and that was how he lived for that time.  Well, the broke-back men were on Oprah, and we got some audio clips.  Concerns about the gay movie.  Here's the first clip.  Oh, I mean, I heard that it was the gay cowboy movie,  and I really didn't want to have anything to do with it.  And I was 16 years old at the time. 
[01:42:30]  Really?  Yeah.  So it had been around.  The script had been around for years.  That is funny in itself.  Wow, man.  They wrote that movie back in 1950.  They originally wanted the Duke.  Right.  Originally wanted Clint Eastwood and John Wayne.  Jesus.  I don't know how to quit you.  How funny is that?  That freaking movie was sitting around for years,  and everyone's like, they didn't have the balls to touch that.  It was, and he said, it was the gay cowboy movie.  That's what everyone called it. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, my God.  They were kind of pissed.  That is funny on so many levels.  During certain interviews, I've seen them pissed when it's called the gay cowboy movie.  And, you know, these guys, it's just like any creative, you know, job.  You just know when you're in the zone.  I bet you the guy that wrote that movie is like,  I know this is a fucking hit, but no one was brave enough to touch it.  No one wants to do it.  So just sitting there year after year.  Do you realize at one point when they were kissing,  one of those actors probably felt it jump.  It jumped at least once while they were kissing.  Just a little, what was that? 
[01:43:30]  Like a little, like a slug would look after a swallow's blood.  Just plumps a little.  Just plumps a little bit.  Wow.  All right, going back.  So the movie was around for a while.  We're going to start this clip over because it's interesting on many levels.  Yeah.  He first heard about the gay cowboy movie when he was 16.  The gay cowboy movie.  And he's easily in his 20s now.  Oh, yeah, I mean, I heard that it was the gay cowboy movie,  and I really didn't want to have anything to do with it.  I was 16 years old at the time. 
[01:44:00]  Really?  Yeah.  So it had been around, the script had been around for years.  So when I finally heard Ang Lee was going to do it,  I read the script, and it was really the most beautiful story I'd ever read,  love story, and I couldn't not do it,  and it didn't really cross my mind at all.  And you, he's...  Yeah, no, I think there was a certain level of, you know, anxiety,  and there were fears, and, you know, the risks...  He's English?  ...led into my initial reaction.  But then that kind of disappeared, 
[01:44:30]  and I was just left with this beautiful story.  Yeah.  It felt important.  It felt like a story that had never been put to screen.  Ah.  Mm.  Yeah.  How do you not just laugh in someone's face?  Yeah.  If I was trying to do a scene like that,  I would just laugh in the guy's face and fucking cry that I had to do it.  As he slowly comes up to your face, in for the kiss.  You just...  Get away from me, you faggot.  As you're going in for the kiss, go, come here, faggot.  Oh. 
[01:45:00]  You fucking faggot.  Yeah.  If your dick gets hard, I'll cut your throat.  Mm.  Just bury your index finger up his asshole.  Just always pat his ass on the set when he's going for dinner,  and just try to snuggle up online when you're fucking getting your craft services food.  What are you doing?  I'm staying in role.  Dude, I'm staying in character.  Come on, dude.  Put it out.  In the role.  Yeah, all right.  I bet you one of them calls more than the other one does.  Yeah.  Like, you know, dude, what are you doing?  I was like, all right, we're finished with this movie. 
[01:45:30]  There's no need to.  Movie's done, dude.  Well, one was nominated and the other wasn't.  So one's acting was a little better.  One acted as a faggot better than the other one.  They can both call themselves winners.  Right.  The guy who's nominated goes, God damn it, I'm good.  And the other guy goes, thank God, I'm not that convincing as a faggot.  Everybody wins.  Good point, Jim.  Good point.  All right, here's the next clip from Oprah.  Yeah.  I think if we knew the response to the movie, too, before we did it,  I don't think either of us could probably have done it. 
[01:46:00]  Why?  I just don't know if we knew that it would have become what it's become  and what it's meant for a lot of people.  But I think ultimately, you know, you have to go and you have to jump into it.  And if you're thinking about a response from people while you're doing it,  there's just, there's no way you can do it.  Especially some of the things.  You have to pretend no one's ever going to see it, you know,  in order to allow yourself to kind of expose yourself and be vulnerable.  Yeah.  Especially the stuff that we do in the movie.  Yeah.  Everyone laughs, especially the stuff we do in the movie.  Ha, ha, ha, yeah, the faggot stuff. 
[01:46:30]  People laugh, see?  All I'd be doing is fucking clearing up the record during that interview.  You know, Oprah, I love pussy.  I mean, it's really been, it was a great experience.  You come out with two whores on your arm.  And here he is.  Yeah, yeah, two whores.  Just one sucking your dick during the interview.  Oprah, I just love girls.  It was so hard to do that faggot shit on film.  Two fucking mows are sitting there chit-chatting it up.  Well, you know, it's a beautiful love story. 
[01:47:00]  Is it?  Stupid.  I mean, according to you two, but not according to God, the rest of the free world.  God!  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Yeah.  Ew, what is that?  That's a clip from the movie.  Ew.  He says,  I wish I knew how to quit you.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Here's a way you can quit him.  Read the Bible, son.  Start by taking Dick A out of asshole B.  Alright, the next clip, they talk about the kissing scene. 
[01:47:30]  Ah, the kissing.  Let's talk about the kiss, guys.  Do you have any idea how much I wish that was the opening line in an Opie and Anthony interview?  Broke back radio show.  Let's talk about the scaffolding.  Jim.  Well, the women in the audience are enjoying it. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  I read, I read that you had to do it 13 times, 13 takes.  Ang Lee, the director.  What?  13 takes.  What?  Of kissing a man.  You know how bad you want to punch a lighting guy in the face when you have to kiss another  guy because there's a boom shadow on your face?  That's no boom shadow.  That's no boom shadow.  13 times.  Why?  I had to do it 13 times, 13 takes. 
[01:48:30]  Ang Lee, the director.  Ang says that that's what we did.  I don't remember it all.  Yeah.  I really don't remember a thing.  And I think, I thought we did it three times or four times.  And look, we can't say that we weren't nervous about it.  You know, once the first take was over, it was like, okay, so what?  It's kissing another human being.  Oh, he kind of slipped there a little bit.  He's trying to rationalize it.  He slipped a little bit there.  Kissing another, yeah, man.  Think of that when your children are holding up that DVD in 20 years and you're in a tub with 
[01:49:00]  your wrist slit.  Daddy, why did you do this for money?  It's being another human being.  You know, how are we going to finish this scene?  Let's get on with it.  Let's get out of here.  You know, there's no way to really prepare for a love scene, whether it's with a guy or  a girl.  I mean, you don't sit at home, you know, kissing your hand or rolling around with a pillow like  this.  Some of us, some of us don't.  I wish I was on that set. 
[01:49:30]  I would have coughed a few times just to make them do it again, especially if one of the  actors was a dick.  Just as it's going, you're like, cut, cut, reshoot, redo.  Just keep moving things around in the background so the continuity's off.  Shuffling things around.  Can I hear that quit you sound again?  I wish I knew how to quit you.  That's not even good acting.  Well, you can't tell from just that clip.  Wish I knew how to quit you.  Wish I knew how to quit you. 
[01:50:00]  Hillbilly sounding breakup.  I only want to hear that if it's fucking, if he's being beaten in a parking lot like  fucking Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights.  That's the only way I want to hear that.  Well, there is kind of a happy ending like that.  All right.  All right.  Here we go.  More on the kissing scene.  Were you uncomfortable and nervous about it?  Yeah.  Of course we were.  Yeah.  I mean, of course we were.  I mean, but it's really...  I think I actually had the easier, an easier task, I think, in those scenes in the tent, 
[01:50:30]  purely because Ennis had to be uncomfortable and he had to have anxiety and fear towards it.  So, in a sense, I knew I had that to give.  Yeah.  I knew something would be...  Yeah.  I had something else to give as well.  Yeah.  But I knew that we would be capturing something, you know?  Yeah, it is kind of odd how the whole thing starts out, just kind of in a tent.  Wait, slow.  One guy's in a tent.  Slow, paint atmosphere.  One of them is in a tent. 
[01:51:00]  Jake is in the tent.  Ew.  And Heath is outside.  He's in his sleeping bag, but it's very cold out.  It's very cold outside.  So, Jake wakes up and tells Heath to get in the tent because it's cold.  So, he comes in the tent and then Jake, out of nowhere, out of nowhere, just starts, like, pulling him towards him to kiss him.  And Heath is very upset about this, so he's kind of pushing away and disagreeing with the whole thing and fighting with him. 
[01:51:30]  And then he kind of gives in.  But he doesn't give in and it starts off slow.  He gives in by spinning Jake around, unbuckling his pants, ripping his pants down, just jamming his dick up his ass.  Didn't even know he was gay.  It does sound so much sweeter with this music playing, though, doesn't it? 
[01:52:00]  That's actually the sound their father's made at the premiere when watching this.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  I think...  I think we do have, uh, the father's watching.  Yes.  Turn it off.  Turn it off! 
[01:52:30]  Turn it off!  Turn it off!  That's my favorite part.  You will keep your hands off of my meal.  Do you think the father's made eye contact at the premiere?  Oh!  No!  They both gave that where-did-you-go-wrong handshake.  That knowing look.  Yeah.  They're just, they're probably just like, yeah, not even looking each other in the eye. 
[01:53:00]  Shook hands and then showed each other their Rolexes and nice cars that the son bought her.  Hey, your son just bought me a house!  Your kid was really good.  No, no, no, your kid was really good.  Alright, we got one more clip from Oprah.  Talking about, uh, the love scenes, like it's a dance, I guess.  That's how they got through it, it's...  Oh, really?  Like a choreo...  Choreographed little, uh, sequence of it.  Wait, the one guy's cold and the other guy says, come in, and he just fucking accosts him? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, with like, there was no real inkling.  See, the Jake character is gay.  The Heath character isn't supposed to be gay, he's just in love with this guy.  But he's not gay.  See, he gets married, has kids, uh, but for some reason he's just in love with this guy.  What year is it supposed to be?  Goes from 1963 up until like the 80s.  Why are they in a tent?  Because it's 1963 Wyoming and they're like herding sheep. 
[01:54:00]  Ugh.  And that was their, like, gig.  And that's like how they brought them together.  And, uh, I don't know.  Cindy's got something.  Cindy in Jersey.  Cindy?  Hey, I went to go see Brokeback Mountain and the thing that shocked me is that they throw, like,  kids in there to, like, throw you off the gay story.  There's boobs in there?  Yeah.  Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams both have their tops off.  I mean, it's...  But it was just, like, weird.  It was, like, trying to throw you off the aspects. 
[01:54:30]  That was, uh, that was what they, uh, do, um, to cleanse the palate, they call it.  For the guys that are there just because their chicks want to see the movie,  maybe you need a little tit to get all that man-ass out of your system.  That's not much of a palate cleanser.  No.  It's like eating two pounds of shit and then going, here's a Tic-Tac.  Yeah.  With that, here's the last clip from the Oprah Winfrey show.  But do you approach it like any other love scene? 
[01:55:00]  I think we approach it like a dance, you know?  Like, when I work with a woman in a love scene, it's always, I mean, I think women are very objectified,  especially actresses when you're doing scenes with them on film.  Absolutely.  And in particular because the majority of the people on set are men, you know?  Right.  So, uh, you have to say, okay, I'm going to move you here, I'm going to go here, I'm going to, I'm going to touch you here,  then we're going to kiss, then I'm going to lay you down, then you're going to, and that's how it was with us, you know?  Um, in that scene you saw, it was like, okay, I'm going to come up, we're going to hug, then, you know, we look at each other, 
[01:55:30]  and then he's, Heath, you're going to pull me back, and you're going to slam me into the, the wall,  and then, and then I'm going to grab you and slam you into the wall, and then we just, first couple times,  I think it was a little, we were scared and it was a little clunky, um, but there have been times where I've been working with women,  and they've just said, you know, hey, I've faked it before, I can fake it again.  That's killing.  Shoot.  He's killing with his gay stuff.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  They probably were wishing that, uh, Ed Wood was still alive to, uh, film that movie. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, right.  Cut.  Perfect.  Print it.  Right.  Well, they would have been nervous kissing each other.  A man of his size would have trouble getting a dick in that little tight ass.  Perfect.  Tor Johnson fucking.  Tor Johnson.  All right, Tor, grab Bella's cock.  Andy, I need a cock in my ass.  Andy.  Carla couldn't smell my shit.  I don't know what that means.  I don't know. 
[01:56:30]  Yeah, that's a tough situation to be in as an actor.  I guess they pull it, they pulled it off.  They pull it off and stick it in.  It's winning all the awards.  Yeah, but you know what?  Hollywood is very, uh, I'm sure it's a good movie.  I've heard it's good.  But Hollywood was, you have to be really bad for Hollywood to kind of turn on it because  that subject matter they really want, I think, to be more accepted.  So I think they were going to kind of be generous.  Oh, I've heard it's very good.  Here's what you're going to get now.  Because of the reaction and the acclaim that this movie has gotten, you're going to get 
[01:57:00]  the copycat movies that come out.  Now people are going to go, hey, look how accepted that was.  Let's make a gay, lethal weapon.  Right.  It's, you know, a buddy film where they're, you know, they fight crime and then they fuck  each other back in the trailer.  What about the bad sequel?  Oh, Brokeback Mountain 2.  Oh.  Oh, God, no. 
[01:57:30]  They couldn't do that.  Instead of Rodney Dangerfield, you get Jackie Mason.  Oh.  Oh.  Ew.  The acting just is drastically.  You want me to put that in my mouth?  I put it in my face.  It smells like onions.  Brokeback Mountain 2.  Well, they would have to then take up where they left off in the early 80s and go from  that into the 90s.  It ends in the 80s.  Uh-oh.  I know.  Into that cowboy hat and a robe.  It all of a sudden looks like a 45-gallon hat.  Swimming on that little head.  I don't know how to quit you. 
[01:58:00]  All right, we're going to break.  Wow.  When we get back, we saved this until you got back, Jimmy.  Well, thank you, Ope.  What is it?  You guys went to the AVN Awards.  Oh, God.  The porn convention.  We never play this audio.  No.  Have you heard it?  Is there any good stuff?  I have no idea.  We were in Vegas, and you guys walked around and talked to, like, gay porn stars and stuff  with Steve.  Well, other ones, too, but...  And we got audio.  Ooh.  And we'll play it on the air live and figure it out as we go.  I have no idea if it's good or bad. 
[01:58:30]  All right?  Oh, gee.  In honor of Brokeback Mountain, here's a fine song from Stephen Lynch.  Anthony, you're twisted.  Sometimes they need punishment. 
[01:59:00]  What the hell's going on over there?  Well, during the break, you know, the Pal Talk people, they can log on and actually join  us during the breaks.  Something I don't think any other radio show does.  You're able to hear what we're talking about when we're in break.  You're able to see what we're doing in here on the camera.  And people seem to enjoy it.  One person in the room, the private pile in the room, had to say, this camera view sucks. 
[01:59:30]  So I pointed the camera at the ceiling and shut the sound off for that break.  They got nothing.  They need to be punished every so often.  They need to be a power trip or something.  They are getting spoiled.  It was one lousy guy.  There's hundreds of people in those rooms.  And the person's name was Little Jimmy Norton, by the way.  It wasn't me.  I know it wasn't you, but they're using your name.  Your good name is being ruined.  He is on a power trip, though.  He's fighting.  He really is. 
[02:00:00]  You have to keep them in line.  They're animals.  You're acting like God with this Pal Talk crap.  They are animals that must be kept in line.  Give them a camera view again.  They have it now, and they have the sound back.  We got the 2020 people in here.  It's an exciting day for everybody.  Not.  Let's go to Tim in Arizona.  Tim, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Tim.  Hey, I'm transporting my brother to his court hearing.  Yeah.  And this is the first time he's ever listened to you guys.  I love you guys. 
[02:00:30]  I think you guys are geniuses.  But it's the first time he's ever listened to you, and I probably should be taking him  back to Brook Mountain, because he doesn't really think you guys are that great.  Tim?  Yeah.  When did you realize that this phone call was going nowhere?  There was a part where you went, oh, my God, I'm bombing.  Oh, I'm bombing.  There was a point when you guys were, like, really silent, and that was it.  And then you realize, uh-oh. 
[02:01:00]  It cued me that I'm a feeb.  I'm a fucking idiot.  Let's go to Boathead Jim.  Remember him from Pennsylvania?  Oh, wow.  This guy's an oldie but goodie calling.  Jim.  How are you guys?  What's going on, buddy?  No, I'm still not leading it, Opie.  Yeah, we tried when we first got here, but now we have a lot more listeners now than  we did then.  Yeah.  This guy is Boathead.  We call him Boathead because he was, when he was 15? 
[02:01:30]  15 years old.  15.  Remember, that's pretty good.  Yes, I have a great memory.  He went-  Oh, you don't.  I know.  Thanks.  I went, he went, I went.  He went on a boat with a neighbor.  Yep.  A little boating outing.  And during that outing, another boat, speedboat, hit their boat.  Hold on, Anthony.  2020, you might want to get this.  Oh, really?  No.  Yeah.  They're like, no, we're fine.  Hit their boat and the bow of the boat hit this kid's head. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  And that's why he's got the name Boathead.  You'd never know it, though.  I mean, to talk to him, you sound pretty normal.  I mean, do people usually know when they first meet you?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  You remember my picture I sent you and you guys stuck on me?  You could open up on your page and you put the Bowie head.  I was kidding.  I know.  I understand.  I understand.  It was funny.  It was funny.  And, um, but my eyes, the way they look, like my left eye, I can't see out of that 
[02:02:30]  at all.  I have never seen it.  Well, you should be part of our American Mess competition.  Great story.  Can't see.  We're having an open call once again this Friday.  If you're an American Mess, you just come on down and we take a look at you.  If you've got a special talent, we'll take that as well.  I can't get there, though.  Why?  Because I live in Pennsylvania and I can drive.  Oh.  Well, no one's ever gotten from Pennsylvania to New York. 
[02:03:00]  Why'd you have somebody drive you?  The who?  The guy?  The guy?  Do you remember when somebody said that they would drive me there?  Yeah.  We don't remember much about you.  Uh, we had to cut our losses and move on.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We gave you the spotlight for a while.  Nothing was going on with it.  We couldn't really develop you, so we just kind of moved on with the radio show.  That's what we do.  That's a little taste of reality there, Jim.  Okay.  Your story wasn't interesting enough to keep it going.  He's actually looking at me as he says that, and it's really hurtful. 
[02:03:30]  You need to throw in the gym.  I know.  I said gym many times, too.  Is Norton in?  No.  Yeah, Norton's back.  So, you're, all right.  Well, let's go with this a little bit.  You're still trying to get laid?  Yes.  I'm still trying to get laid, and.  Well, what have you done?  Have you been proactive?  Well, I try.  Or are you sitting back just waiting for your doorbell to ring one day?  No, I go out.  I go out, and I get labeled as being a drunk.  And I don't even drink that much. 
[02:04:00]  I can't drink that much.  I mean, I'm not, I'm not any, I'm not a drinker, I guess.  But I get labeled.  And it sucks.  You've never been laid?  Nope.  Well, just get a prostitute.  Once again, I live in a town where, well.  Please don't tell me you have morals.  No, no, I don't have morals. 
[02:04:30]  I live in a town where I was offered to get laid by some, I guess, by somebody.  I don't know if she's up or not.  But she said she'd do me for $1,000.  Jesus.  Exactly.  Well, well, I almost gave her the money, but then I found out she had hepatitis C.  Stupid.  Don't spend $1,000.  Pay that kind of money.  You can just rent, have a car, take you to New York.  You spend a couple hundred, and you get a nice lay. 
[02:05:00]  What's the matter with you?  And the going raid for a hooker with hepatitis C is like $200.  With hepatitis C?  Yeah.  Not $1,000.  I understand that.  Hold on a minute.  We might have a ride to New York for you for Friday's American Mess Show.  Jim, what's up?  We've got a ride.  Hey, where's Jim at in Pennsylvania?  I might be able to drive a van.  I live in Spring now.  What's that, right outside of Philly, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's about 45 minutes out of Philadelphia. 
[02:05:30]  It's in between downtown and Philadelphia.  Hopey, can you tell me back on hold?  I'll give Derek my info, and he can have Jim call me.  Yeah, because we need some people to show up this Friday for American Mess.  Yeah, we'll get you here.  And we've never seen Jim live, so this would be pretty cool.  Hold on, Jim.  Okay, guys.  Thanks a lot, man.  Actually, hold on to both Jims.  We'll try to get a connection here, and hopefully Boathead Jim will be in studio Friday for American Mess.  All right?  If anyone else is planning on coming down Friday, we'd love to hear from you, just to see what we have. 
[02:06:00]  Let's go to Anthony in New York.  Anthony.  Yo, what's up, ba-ba-ba-boy?  What's up, Anthony?  What's going on?  Listen, you remember you had this guy in from American Pie raving about this play he's doing in Manhattan.  Dog sees God.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  We were listening.  We talked about Riza Dushku and how Peppermint Patty was a whore.  I was starting to get a hammer.  I'm like, oh.  Hold on, hold on.  Before you do your punchline, I got to say, I was with you, bro. 
[02:06:30]  We had the guy in.  He was from American Pie.  He's a good actor.  He goes, hey, I'm in this play.  It's based on the Peanuts, Charles Schultz, and I'm like, and he plays Charlie Brown.  And I'm like, I'm there.  It's off, off, off Broadway.  What the hell?  You know, you think it's going to be good, right?  Right.  You go there, and halfway through the play, it just hits a wall.  It felt so uncomfortable. 
[02:07:00]  It was like, I don't know.  It was like, they sit there, and they throw these two guys.  This one guy is just a flaming homo.  I mean, he plays a pole.  And he's going to make it out.  He's the guy that plays the piano in Peanuts.  Right.  It turns out to be like Brokeback Charlie Brown.  It turns out that Charlie Brown is, he's gay.  It's all fucking, it's all homo.  It's like.  And you want to talk about an actor getting into the role. 
[02:07:30]  He has no problem kissing the piano player guy.  The pianist.  Well, it sucks that in a play, you got to do it every night.  At least Brokeback Mountain, you do it a few, you know, 13 times, and you're done.  A fucking play.  You hope it doesn't have a six-year run.  You're mugging with this douchebag six times a week.  It's like you turn my penis characters off to shit dicks.  I looked around the theater like, holy, who saw this coming?  Maybe the actor, when he was on the fine radio program, could have gave us a little hint  that even off mic.  Even off mic, he maybe could have gave me a little hint that this. 
[02:08:00]  He wouldn't be able to fucking get anybody from this show to go and watch.  That's what it was.  You kidding me?  He would have been able to get everybody from the show to go to watch.  To watch fucking Charlie Brown gay it out with fucking Beethoven.  We all would have went to laugh at that.  Yeah.  All right.  Oh, no, that's all I got.  I'm punching out.  Repo it out.  All right.  What?  I don't know.  You hear the latest on Chris Penn?  It's a very gay show today, by the way.  Well, just gay subject matter coming up a lot in the news. 
[02:08:30]  It's too bad 2020's not doing a piece on gay stuff, because we have plenty of material  for them today.  Plenty of that.  I don't know if this is true.  I don't know either, but it seems like, you know, until somebody dies, it's in page six  and it's a big secret.  It has to be true.  They never get anything wrong.  Oh, it's got to be true on page six?  Yeah, sure.  I don't know what it is, but until you die, all this stuff stays pretty secretive.  And then they say everyone in Hollywood knew.  Oh, everyone knew he had this huge drug problem.  Yeah.  I didn't know.  I didn't either.  Well. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, Jimmy.  That's right.  And you were one of the insiders.  We have the same manager.  We have the same manager.  No.  Yeah.  Jonathan was very close to him.  I never met him, but he would always talk about him.  He has a flying show that I have.  It's like one degree of Jimmy Norton.  I know.  One degree of Jimmy Norton.  You could name any celebrity, and Jimmy is somehow related to that person through one  other person.  Well, yeah, but that does me no good.  I mean, yeah, we both like trannies.  That's what does it really?  I don't believe that.  Yeah, look at this story, man. 
[02:09:30]  All right.  It's Penn Head Long Drug History.  It's in page six of the New York Post today.  Chris Penn's autopsy results aren't back yet, but grieving friends of the talented actor  privately suspect that his death was caused by drugs.  One pen pal.  I get it.  That's so cute.  One pen pal said Chris fought a battle with drugs his whole life, and it had gotten bad  again.  Chris, brother to Oscar winner, Sean Penn, blah, blah, blah, also had lately been spotted  hanging out at L.A. Tranny Hotspot.  Tranny. 
[02:10:00]  Tranny, sorry.  Uh, Tranny Hotspot, the spotlight.  Jimmy, comment?  No, I don't have any comments at all.  The fucking sodas there are never good.  Ever hear of the place?  No, actually I have not.  No.  He became friends with a transvestite named Bobby, but they had a falling out several  months ago, claimed one source.  Uh, Chris, who was open about his drug demons, told Entertainment Tonight in 1998, I was a  drug addict, and it was a tough time.  I couldn't face my family.  I couldn't even face myself. 
[02:10:30]  I'm clean three and a half years.  I don't look back with regret.  I simply say that I learned from it, and it was a mistake, but I learned from it, and  I'm a better person today.  Penn and Bobby, last seen at, uh, F.H.  Riley's in Huntington.  Easy.  Wow, that's what I, I heard in, uh, page six yesterday.  Easy.  I've heard it may have been a sleep thing with him.  Really?  Yep.  He died in the sleep, man.  They think it was asleep.  He was in his bed.  Sleep, uh, uh.  The apnea killed Reggie White, so it wouldn't surprise me if that is what did him to it.  Really?  It was pretty bloated. 
[02:11:00]  And that kills like 30,000 people a year.  That's bad.  I learned that on Celebrity Fit Club last night.  Yikes.  It's all about celebrityality.  So that's the latest on Chris Penn.  That's what they know so far.  Drugs and, uh, like the trannies.  That's what, uh.  They're friends with Bobby.  Well, they spelled a B-O-B-B-Y in the paper.  I bet you the Bobby probably spells it with an I at the end.  I, yeah.  Sort of androgynous.  Something cute.  Yeah.  Little heart over the eye.  We interrupt this program to bring you the ozone midget sighting of the day. 
[02:11:30]  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  Fucking whack bag.  They don't get anything.  Actually, people do get it.  There's always one or two that don't.  What do you mean?  Why does Opie have to say, wow, who saw this coming every time that, every time there's  a midget sighting?  Angry typing guy, ladies and gentlemen.  See, it's angry typing guy.  See, because it's called sarcasm because I'm the one that sees it coming.  Right.  Holy shit.  Do you have to explain everything to some of these people?  Yes.  Perhaps more than that.  There was a whole thread on whack bag.  Why does Opie have to say that every time? 
[02:12:00]  He's the one that's taking, they actually wrote that.  He's the one taking the phone call, so wouldn't he be the one that sees it coming?  Yes.  That's why I say, who saw this coming?  You're not supposed to take message board stuff to heart.  You're supposed to blow it off.  It just amazes me, though.  Mm-hmm.  The stupidity sometimes.  By a small percentage.  I'm not trashing the whole board.  I'm not.  I think they've been amazing lately.  Yeah.  But there's a small percentage that doesn't get the most subtle, stupid things on this program. 
[02:12:30]  They get hammered.  Even Danny, our own Danny, got pissed off at the board the other day and exploded.  And I had a laugh at him.  Why?  They were bitching about the best ofs, or worst of, however you want to put it, that we play.  And somebody said that the same one ran all weekend long.  But it was a three-parter of, I guess, the eggnog drinking contest.  So it was three parts that ran, and somebody was on the message board saying, well, what? 
[02:13:00]  Can I do an angry typing guy?  Yeah, please.  I don't want to take your character.  It's all right.  Why are you running the same segment three times on one weekend?  Thank you.  And it turns out that Danny was running, like I said, three parts, so he just unloaded.  You asshole.  Were there some curses in your post, Danny?  No, I think I tried to keep it pretty tame. 
[02:13:30]  I'd just tell it how it was, sort of a thing.  Yeah, but you pointed out that some people on the board are jerks or asses or something.  It was a little personal.  Well, because they're so nitpicky.  Right.  Nitpicky is the word I was looking for.  Split hairs.  Split hairs.  Split hairs.  What else did they do, 80-year-old man?  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, I say.  He shook his fist to him and said, you darn kids.  Yeah, those damn pinch pennies.  23 skidoo.  That's meddling. 
[02:14:00]  You have meddling.  Why you?  It was a three-parter.  You do that threatening fist thing that's not threatening at all because it's all awkwardly in front of you.  Yeah, big liver spots on it.  When you can see the liver spots and the translucent skin with the veins through it,  it's not as angry anymore.  Yeah, I saw you up there and I was just like, oh, Danny, don't fall into it.  I know, I know, I know.  Did you post?  Well, yeah, I started a thread.  He actually started a thread.  What's your post name?  Is Danny?  Foundry Music Danny. 
[02:14:30]  Okay.  Well, the post is, if you're going to complain, at least get it right.  This is a free forum which you may speak your mind, and that's fantastic.  However, if you must bitch about something, get your fucking facts straight.  Sing, you did curse.  Okay.  You did curse.  And then it would have simply responded to the thread itself instead of starting a new  one, but it is now closed.  The Eggnog Contest 05 is split into three different parts.  This also took place before Christmas.  Do you realize how many new people there are listening now?  You're not hearing the same shit. 
[02:15:00]  Two curses.  Two curses.  See?  You're healing, or you're H-E-A-I-N-G.  He meant hearing.  Yeah.  He meant hearing.  You're a thing I hate when you misspell when you're mad on the message board.  You write something, and you're all pissed off, and then you misspell something, and your  point goes out the window, and someone goes, why don't you run it through spell check?  Yeah.  You call somebody a dumb cunt with a K?  You're hearing one bit over three days. 
[02:15:30]  As much as I'm sure you'd love it, I can't play Tony Danza and Dragon Wagon every day.  Now, why not?  Yeah, why not?  Those are fine bits.  I'll say.  Maybe I'll make a week of it.  Punishment.  And why would it run three days, though?  Because it was long.  It was long.  I couldn't play it in an hour.  Too much of a cliffhanger for people, though.  So I figured instead of not running it at all.  Because part one, if you only heard part one, then...  Then you missed the end.  If you only heard the end, you missed the setup. 
[02:16:00]  So it's like you're expecting everybody to have been there the entire three days, which  never happens.  Our audience does.  Yeah, they don't think that way.  We've heard that up to 2% of our audience actually works and holds jobs.  So that would be difficult for them to...  Indeed.  We interrupt this program to bring you the Ozone Midget Sighting of the Day.  Wow.  Sean in Buffalo. 
[02:16:30]  Hey, what's going on?  Hey, Sean.  I just sent a picture to Steve, too, of my midget sighting.  It's a security guard at the mall here out in Buffalo.  A midget security guard at a mall?  Yeah, and I couldn't get a better picture.  He was having a little talk with either a 7- or 8-year-old there.  Steve should have it.  I sent to him last night.  What could he possibly do?  I understand that, you know...  See, I like...  You shouldn't...  Well, I like the listeners that they're getting proof of their midget sightings. 
[02:17:00]  With the camera phones.  Yeah, because a lot of fans are calling Bravo Sierra on some of these midget sightings.  But here's a guy who took it upon himself to prove that he saw a midget.  I understand we shouldn't discriminate, but a security guard is a job that you need something like speak.  We should discriminate.  If you're under a certain height, like if you're a midget or a dwarf, here's what your job should be.  You should be forced to run in a circle in the mall while circus music plays.  That's the only job you're allowed. 
[02:17:30]  Horrible and degrading, and I don't agree with your stance on...  Maybe you can skip a little...  No.  ...with a miniature pony next to you.  Boop-doop-doop-doop-doop-doop-doop-doop.  That's all you're permitted to do.  The only way I agree with what you're saying is if they wear curly shoes with bells on them.  But other than that, I disagree totally.  Maybe wear tall baby clothes.  Sean, so what was he doing?  Oh, he was having a little talk with some kids, I guess.  I don't know.  They were getting in some trouble or something, but...  How could he chase anybody that's shoplifting? 
[02:18:00]  Like, I've watched those closed-circuit camera things, and they're great.  Somebody shoplifts, they run, they barely make it to the door, they get tackled by security.  What are you...  Hey, you!  Stop it!  Put that down!  Stop it!  You don't have to chase them, because when a midget yells stop, you just walk away.  No.  What are you going to do about it?  Oh, I knew he worked...  Embarrass me?  People will think you're my unruly son?  Yeah, I knew he worked in the mall, so I went hunting for him.  And it was during the Christmas season, and I finally seen him running through a little  crowd there, and I couldn't grab my phone quick enough, and he was gone before I knew 
[02:18:30]  it.  Oh, good for him.  Hey, we got a guy that can confirm Sean's midget sighting.  Let's go to Mike in Buffalo.  Mike?  Yes, this is Mike.  Hey.  Hey.  I'd just like to confirm the midget sighting.  I'm in Buffalo, and we affectionately call him Inch High Private Eye.  Inch High Private Eye.  Yes.  That's pretty good.  On Fox this summer.  A new name for a whack bag, too.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  All right.  All right.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  We should get Steve in here.  We got to talk about this audio you guys got at the porn convention. 
[02:19:00]  Where's Steve?  That might not be good, but we should listen to it first.  No.  No.  That's the beauty of what we do.  On the fly.  We don't have time to pre-listen to this stuff.  Hi, Steve.  Yeah, Steve.  Get over there so they can get you on 2020.  So they can film you for 20 minutes and use none of it.  Long time no see.  Hi, sweetie.  I'm good.  How are you?  I'm lovely.  So you guys went to the porn convention when we were out there in Vegas.  Yeah.  The Adult Expo.  We know better.  You do?  Yeah, because the first year we went, you guys went, we went to the convention. 
[02:19:30]  And it is, for these guys, it's like they're rock stars, all these porn stars.  They know their names.  They know all the companies.  They're so excited.  And to me, it's just stinky horror convention.  It's like girls with ugly fake tits and too much perfume that's obviously covering up a night of action.  And that, to me, not as into it as these two.  These two are running around like it's Disney.  Personally, last year I enjoyed when all the sleazy directors were coming up to my girlfriend and asking if she ever thought about doing porn. 
[02:20:00]  That was a highlight for me.  I got to tell you.  They were doing it?  Oh, God.  I got to tell you.  It was a highlight for me.  I don't know.  They're just in the motion picture business.  In the motion picture business.  That was just wonderful.  They were recruiting.  Yeah, they were.  Lindsay does not get that picture.  That was a treat for everybody involved.  Anyway, well, we learned.  And then there's guys there, and they're completely naked except for a sock or something or some leather band. 
[02:20:30]  They're touching their junk.  They've got their hand on their cock.  And then they want to shake your hand.  That's a fine how do you do.  Thank you, no.  What's wrong with that?  There's not enough Purell on the planet to make me go back to that place and shake anyone's hand.  Really?  Don't be broads.  They sit down for an interview, and it's like, so what do you do?  Well, I was nominated for Best Anal in a gangbang.  Fantastic.  Where'd you go to school? 
[02:21:00]  Right.  There's nothing I could ask these women.  The best part for me last year, afterwards, we went up to the Venetian to have lunch in that outdoor.  Right.  It's inside, but it looks like you're in an outdoor cafe, and there's a bunch of us having a nice little lunch.  And it was all the women that were rejects that were hoping to get discovered at the porn convention, and they weren't getting discovered.  So you had these messes walking around with tiny little outfits.  And one girl had, like, a drill dough, and her boyfriend that was dragging around, because the boyfriend was hoping that she was going to get discovered so they could pay their bills. 
[02:21:30]  And it was so obvious they weren't going to get discovered, and they were walking around all rejected, that no one gave a shit that you were there.  And they're walking through this really, really nice restaurant area while people are trying to eat.  Great.  People trying to eat.  And third-rate whores are walking through.  Yeah, they just did not get discovered at the porn convention.  Not into it.  So this year, you guys walked around.  It was Jim, Steve, and Laszlo?  Yeah, we learned our lesson from last time.  I mean, Ant's right.  You try to interview some of the girls, and all they do is they just start plugging immediately. 
[02:22:00]  They don't really know how to conduct a conversation.  They just start immediately telling you what videos they're in, and it's pretty boring.  So Jimmy and Laszlo and myself sort of zeroed in on a couple key areas, parts of the convention floor.  Did you cut this audio up?  Yeah.  Okay.  Jimmy's so nervous.  Don't worry.  No, it's fine.  But I don't remember it.  You will.  It's been about three weeks or so.  You guys talked to Mark Sterling.  Who's Mark Sterling?  Mark Sterling is, I believe he was, well, the first thing we did. 
[02:22:30]  He's a gay porn actor.  Yes, he's a gay porn actor.  And he discusses what genre Steve would be best for.  Yeah, this was Jimmy's little treat.  Jimmy brought us all the way into the back corner of the room and decided how many gay guys wanted to bone me.  Something tells me his take on kissing and having sex with other men a little different than what we heard from Oprah and the Brokeback Mountain.  And the 2020 cameraman put down his camera.  Holy moly.  Oh, Jim just left his seat completely because 84 Babe is now diddling herself on Pal Talk. 
[02:23:00]  And if anyone else sends me an IM telling me to pull up 84 Babe's cam, I'm bouncing you.  And you won't get to see it.  So stop IMing me.  Why don't you like her?  Can I tell you, because she blocked me one time when I tried to talk to her for something.  Now you're going to ruin it for everybody because you personally, she wouldn't fuck you.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  I don't, she's very beautiful.  But it was actually like a legitimate question or something. 
[02:23:30]  Like her camera wouldn't come up and be like, oh, yeah, she must have blocked you.  Like, for what?  No, she didn't block.  A lot of guys pop her camera up and it's hard for, you know, the camera, the software doesn't recognize that's Jimmy Norton.  Well, let me shove everyone else's bandwidth aside and get right to Jimmy.  No, but I heard it was blocked.  It was like there was like a few people in the room.  It was some weird thing.  I don't think you can do that, though.  I don't know.  It just bothered me.  Can you get your diseases through the Internet?  Maybe she was blocking it for a reason.  Something McAfee doesn't cover, AIDS.  I was offended.  All right, so here's Mark Sterling talking to the boys at the porn convention. 
[02:24:00]  What do you think of him?  Now, a lot of people tell him that he should do adult videos, but he's too shy.  What do you think of him?  Would he make a good living in adult films?  I don't do any casting myself.  If you're doing a reality show, would his face be well-received by your audience?  I think it would sell for an audience, yeah.  Really?  Would the community recognize that look?  Yes.  Good. 
[02:24:30]  In fact, I have a company, actually, that would probably sign him right now.  Really?  What company?  Bearfilms.com.  Bearfilms?  B-E-A-R?  Yes.  You have no idea how perfect that is.  Why do you say that?  It's a huge market.  The Bearfilms are like hot sellers, but nobody makes them.  And you kind of fit a category, in my opinion of that.  Are you saying he's a bear?  He fits that stereotype, yes.  Okay.  I hate you.  There's this whole thing, I guess, in the gay community. 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  This bear thing.  Yes.  Now, we're talking B-E-A-R.  Yes.  Like a fuzzy bear.  Right.  They're big gentlemen.  Right.  Usually a lot of body hair.  And this is a typo, almost a fetish, I guess, for some gay people.  And for some reason, Steve, our lovely Steve, fits in perfectly.  Apparently.  And these bear lovers love him.  And this asshole couldn't have been happier every time.  You're saying apparently you've got a flaming bear on your T-shirt this morning. 
[02:25:30]  Yeah, but that's a little much.  Yeah, exactly.  A flaming bear and stay cozy on your shirt.  I just thought this was a cool design.  What's cool about it's a teddy bear with fire on it.  And I'm not even making a joke.  Like, your shirt was crumpled in front, so the stay looked like it said gay.  So it would be gay cozy.  Wow.  Oh, well, now it's not.  Apparently.  You have a flaming bear right on the front of your shirt.  All right.  But it's a fire.  It's a little teddy bear.  Flaming is, you know, you would think flaming.  All right. 
[02:26:00]  I'm not defending myself well right now.  No.  I'm no.  More Mark Sterling talking about Steve, the gay porn actor.  What's the difference between a bear and a cub?  Is there a difference?  There's a very slight difference.  A bear is much more masculine than a cub.  It's much more shy, much more submissive than a bear.  So he'd be more of the dominant fellow.  Yeah.  All right.  Lovely.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You have no idea how happy you just made me.  He's going to torment me for a year now.  Thank you.  I'm trying to get a rap going before we leave. 
[02:26:30]  I know, really.  He's no idea teasing me for a lot, really.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Jimmy.  He doesn't care.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  And that was just the first one.  All right.  Now we get some audio from Tiger.  Who's Tiger?  Tiger?  Oh, Tiger was this guy at another gay booth.  He was wearing leather assless chaps and big, you know.  Of course he was.  I don't know.  The chains on the front of his chest, I don't know what they're called.  But it was, I certainly don't. 
[02:27:00]  And Jim wanted to ask him a couple questions.  All right.  Yeah, discusses what genre Steve would be best for.  Hi, I'm Jim.  Hi, Jim.  How are you doing?  Tiger.  Hi, Tiger.  And this is Steve.  Pleasure to meet you, Steve.  How are you?  Let me ask you a question.  Yes, sir.  I've been taking a poll.  This gentleman I'm standing here, would he do well in the adult industry?  People tell him that he should get into films and he's too shy.  Do you think he would do okay?  We've got to check things out first. 
[02:27:30]  Go ahead.  Just a little something.  His face.  Keep grabbing it.  His face is good for adult films.  Very handsome gentleman.  You think so?  Beautiful eyes.  What?  He's got this.  He has beautiful eyes.  Got to give him that.  What market do you think he would do well in?  Like, what niche would he fit?  Is there like a...  Bear.  Can you please say that again?  Bear.  You'd be a bear.  He doesn't think he has bear qualities, but everyone tells him the same thing. 
[02:28:00]  You're like the third person to tell him that.  Go out for him.  Go out for him.  Go out for him.  Thank you very much.  I'm a bear cow.  I got the bear in you.  What?  Wow.  I forgot how utterly embarrassing that bear bill was.  You really do fit.  Apparently.  They really like you as a bear.  Yeah.  There aren't many bear pornos that are made.  Why if it's such a big thing? 
[02:28:30]  I don't know.  I always thought there were.  There's a whole...  There's booth...  There were booths after booth with, like, these big burly guys and, you know, chaps.  So I was assuming that...  The guy tried to grab his cock.  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.  Right when Jimmy told him to, you know, to take a look at me, the guy reached in for  my...  See, that's another thing about these stupid conventions and stuff.  They assume everyone there is fine with just being grabbed by another man, your cock being  grabbed, your tits.  Girls just...  You're right up there.  Hey, guy, I'll grab her pussy right there in front of everybody. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  And then, you know, it's commonplace there.  But when you're not ready for it and the gay guy goes in for the grab, it's...  At least be ready for it, right?  Right, exactly.  Would you want to fluff up a little, stupid?  Make it plump?  I'm just...  I'm not going to...  Arr.  The guy did the bear.  Arr.  Arr.  Yeah, he did.  Well, it gets better.  Now we get to talk to Tanya, the unconvincing tranny.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, her.  Oh, boy.  What's this about?  I don't know. 
[02:29:30]  Don't look at me.  I don't remember.  We interviewed Tanya last year, and she's a brutish-looking transvestite.  Hi, Daddy.  One of those with the voice.  Yeah, yeah.  Like blonde, a lot of silicone injections in her lips, but uneven.  So one lip is sort of like up there, and the other one's down there, and it just doesn't  look good.  And, you know, Jim wanted to...  Wanted to talk with her.  And him.  Steve, you got some good news from her.  Yes, I do.  Okay, we're about to interview Tanya, who probably is the most unpassable tranny I've ever seen 
[02:30:00]  in my life.  Um, who does she look like?  Besides not any woman you've ever seen.  I think we interviewed Tanya last year.  We did.  And it looks worse this year than it did last year.  I think there's a lot more, uh, there's a lot more surgery that's been done.  You think so?  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Apparently by Dr. Brick.  All right.  I'll interview you for a radio show.  Okay.  I remember y'all from Nashville.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  I know.  Okay.  Okay, sit down, sweetie.  All right, buddy.  We've been walking around ABN, and he wants to be a part of ABN. 
[02:30:30]  Do you think that that face would sell in adult films?  Sweetie, it ain't about the face.  It's about the penis.  But by his face, what niche would he fit?  The only way his face is going to make it in the internet, if there's a penis involved  in his face.  She's saying his face alone is not enough to sell anything.  Not in males.  The only way a face is going to sell a male product is possibly to gays. 
[02:31:00]  That's what I mean.  I'm sorry.  You don't look like queer bait to me.  Thank you.  Wow.  Thank you.  That's amazing.  Is that why you left that in there?  I'm so happy.  You're the first person to say that.  Everybody else had said he fits the bear category.  You just wanted people to hear that you don't fit the queer bait category.  Can I have one piece of audio that defends me?  Is there?  That one?  That wasn't.  No.  A tranny that looks like a man saying you don't look right for the part.  It didn't look like queer bait. 
[02:31:30]  You know what her face looks like?  She looks like a boxer from the 50s.  Like the lip is kind of up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And she really looks like she's been knocked around a little.  Yeah.  The cheekbones weren't really even.  You still say she.  Wait.  Oh, yeah.  Had her respect.  Hold on.  I'll give you the red face.  Had her respect.  Had her respect.  All right.  Next is Delilah Strong.  Delilah Strong.  That was...  Anything?  I don't know.  Porn actress Laszlo and I interviewed her.  Oh, she wanted to tell us how she got into the porn business. 
[02:32:00]  Okay.  With Smash Pictures, I guess she works for her.  Oh, yeah.  We were at the Smash Pictures booth and, yeah, we were advised to go ask her how she got into  the porn business by Yoshi, actually.  Answer is always a drunk uncle, a bottle of whiskey, and a not far off summer night with  an open window.  Delilah, I've seen you in a few movies.  I think you were in Brandon Irons' 50 to 1, right?  That's right.  And how long have you been in the business?  Two years.  I have over 150 movies out today.  Jesus.  And what prompted a lovely girl such as yourself to get into this business? 
[02:32:30]  Well, my mom was in the business, so it was kind of an opening door for me.  Who's your mom?  Deborah Cox.  81, 82.  She put out about 12 movies.  A lot of girls.  A lazy bitch.  Really?  Yeah, but I think it was probably my first sexual experience that really made me understand  that I was such a whore.  And tell us about your first sexual experience.  I was 14.  I was over at my girlfriend's house, and her dad was kind of flirting with me. 
[02:33:00]  She went to bed early.  We were hanging out.  Long story short, I ended up sucking his dick.  And at the very last moment when he came, I didn't realize that people didn't swallow.  I kind of thought that's what you were supposed to do.  So I swallowed it, and so I've always been a swaller.  And after that, after I told my friends about it, they said I was such a dirty whore.  And I said, you know what?  There's only one line of work for me.  What did your friend do when she found out that you sucked her dad's dick?  She didn't talk to you anymore.  I didn't have a lot of friends in high school because I fucked everybody's boyfriend. 
[02:33:30]  It's a good way to make a lot of enemies.  It happens, but fuck it, right?  Sex is sex.  Ah, you know, at least she tied it all up in the end with that explanation.  Sex is sex.  Wow.  Yeah.  All right, one more clip from the point of that.  Wait, can we just maybe, you know, jerk off to that one for a while?  How fantastic was that?  And it's so wrong, you're supposed to vilify that guy. 
[02:34:00]  What a filthy, filthy whore she is.  Yeah.  You're supposed to think, oh my God, that man is awful.  And the whole time Laszlo and I are talking to her, she's pulling her panties down and  showing us her vag, and I think the two of us at that point had been so desensitized  we didn't even notice that it was going on.  Well, maybe Laszlo did.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Where was that going?  I don't know.  Did you notice the vag?  Yeah, you didn't notice the vag.  You could be in bear porno and Tranny grabbed your cock. 
[02:34:30]  So what?  Why wouldn't you notice the vag?  I think I was so taken back by the story.  Yeah.  Maybe not.  If I had a mousetrap, I'd smash my hand in it, but I don't think I'd.  Yeah.  So.  You didn't notice the...  You really just sit here alone.  You love the fact that I'm sweating.  Why are you sweating?  It's so long.  What?  Just, well, yeah, they really are dainty lashes.  Thank you.  They're very long.  Clockwork orange eyes.  And how many vagids do you have to see before you don't notice them anymore? 
[02:35:00]  You're desensitized.  I don't know.  I've seen a lot.  I've seen a lot.  I watch a lot of porn.  So.  So.  I should have just.  Ha, ha.  Well, no.  After talking to all the men, you just, you didn't notice the dirty thing with teeth.  Oh, yeah.  Filthy hatchet wound.  I just didn't pay attention.  Dirty, dirty.  Pillars.  It seems logical, I guess.  What the hell?  Yeah.  I'm sure everyone out there, you know.  Yeah, I should have kept that comment to myself.  Yeah, if a guy with chains with his chest tries to grab your cock, why would you notice 
[02:35:30]  a vagina?  Right.  You're absolutely right.  I apologize.  Why would you try to cleanse the palate with a nice young vag?  No, she was lovely.  I just didn't notice until Laszlo brought it up, but okay.  So 150 movies or whatever it was in two years?  She's a busy girl.  Yeah.  She used to tuck her pussy in so she didn't close the car door on it.  What a mess.  Jesus.  One more clip.  It's Delilah Strong.  You were essentially molested at 14. 
[02:36:00]  And you didn't chill.  It was way to kill the vibe, Steve.  You just start blowing guys all the time?  I didn't consider being sexually molested.  I wanted it.  I probably antagonized him a little, you know, wearing little short shorts and flirting.  But, you know, I guess it's considered molestation.  I think in any court, in any state in this country, it would be called molestation.  That's true.  Fuck it.  Way to go, Ironside.  Yeah.  It's a hot story.  Well, technically, I think that violates.  What are you trying to do?  Break her down into tears? 
[02:36:30]  Well, I was kind of, you know.  You're right.  Oh, my God.  Where am I in my life?  I was really, I didn't want to sit there acting like I condoned it.  You know, it was sort of like I wanted to see what her reaction would be.  You're at the porn convention.  Exactly.  Church.  Yeah, but that, like, yeah, it was a hot story, but, you know, at some point.  Good.  Good.  I'm glad he fucked you.  Did mom come in, too?  That's how it's supposed to go.  You should start your own lawyer show.  Perry Cockblocker.  She didn't mind.  It obviously wasn't a big deal after I said you were molested.  She even said it was, you know. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  She was kind of asking for it.  Provoking the situation.  Yeah, exactly.  All right.  Let's go to Brian on Long Island.  Brian.  Yeah, I want to know if Jimmy likes playing with the fucking yambags.  No, sir.  No, sir?  No.  He sounds like listening to this show that he does.  I mean, him and Steve were getting more excited over gay guys than they would over...  No, no, no.  So what you don't understand is this.  To get the audio, I agree with the guys, most of the audio you're going to get is just  going to be nonsense, so I figured we would do something silly and try to get guys just 
[02:37:30]  to confirm that Steve looks like a bear to make him uncomfortable.  That doesn't constitute liking playing with the yambag.  I think you guys like...  In fact, they have to explain that.  Hold on.  What's that, sir?  You want to reach through and hit him.  I definitely think he likes playing with a yambag over there, it sounds like.  No, sir.  That's not what it is.  All right.  Awfully mysterious.  Travis from West Virginia.  Hey, this is Travis.  I got a confirmed Steve's desensitizing thing about pussies.  Work in a strip club, and after you see about 50 or 60 other things every two or three 
[02:38:00]  days, you don't even look at them anymore.  I agree with you, sir, but right after you're talking to a bunch of gay guys and one with  a chain who calls you a bear and goes, grr, and then you go, grr, back, to not notice  a vagina is a little odd.  And Steve did go, grr, back.  Louder and more enthusiastically than he had to.  I certainly did not.  You did so.  Grr.  Grr.  I could have done it with my mouth closed.  You and your pretty eyes.  He got cocky after that, too.  Like, he was opening his eyes wide, talking to everybody.  Which clip?  I did not.  Which clip was it where Steve went, grr, back?  Ugh, please. 
[02:38:30]  Steve, which clip is it?  Uh, I...  Was it at the end of one of the clips?  It was, uh, one of the tiger clips, I think.  Yeah, it was the name of Tiger.  All right, hold on.  Let me see that guy.  Oh, man, he grabbed my dick.  Grr.  Grr.  Go back.  All right, now for him.  Grr.  Thank you very much for the bear cows.  I got the bear in here.  Ew.  Yeah, that was sexy.  Why would you agree to the grr?  Because stupid here was prodding me to do it.  Just do it.  Just do it.  Just do it.  I wouldn't have grrred at Tiger.  You certainly would have. 
[02:39:00]  Tiger grrred at you when you grrred back at us.  What happened to the community?  You were, you know, it's a shame we don't have video of him, like, you know, nudging  me.  Just go along with it.  Go along with it.  It just came out.  It was an instinct.  Tiger went, grr, and Steve went, grr.  They're like the Masons.  It's like the one gives, like, the sign, and Steve gave the secret grr shake back.  Yeah.  I did not.  I did not.  Well, it sounds like you two had a lot of fun there.  I did have fun.  The porn convention strippers, dirty, dirty whores.  Yeah.  Well, we took care of it so you guys didn't have to. 
[02:39:30]  Thank you.  You're welcome.  Big fake tits that they think look good.  See, a lot less.  Actually, I saw a lot less fake tits.  Apparently, the fake tits are-  Stretched over breast bones.  Like, ugh.  I hate that look.  The fake tits are becoming very passe, I think.  I didn't see a lot of them.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  You think?  I don't know.  You don't care.  Sorry to keep you up there, Jimmy.  No, I'm just getting my schedule back, man.  It's going to be a little while.  I flew yesterday.  Still on L.A.  time.  No, I just take pills when I fly.  And I had a delay at the airport.  And the flight was delayed.  And fucking an hour, I had to wait for my car. 
[02:40:00]  Because they forgot to make the reservation.  So I called up and I'm screaming.  I've never screamed on the phone like this.  I'm like, don't be fuck.  The incompetent cocksucker who made this reservation.  And the guy's like, oh, it was me.  And he admitted to it.  He's like, I'm sorry.  It was just really busy.  So I kind of felt silly when I got in the car.  I was like, whoops.  Let's go to Bukkake.  Bukkake.  Hey, guys.  I love your show.  I subscribe to Hick.  It doesn't just to get you guys.  But another story.  I was a bouncer for like three years.  Every time I saw Piss and Pussy, man, I screamed like a little schoolgirl. 
[02:40:30]  I thought that they were going to think that I was a pussy to them or something.  But fucking A, it's great every time.  Exactly.  Thank you so very much.  All right.  Steve got tired of it after four minutes.  I didn't get tired of it.  I just didn't notice.  I just don't get it.  All right.  Thank you.  It doesn't make sense.  All right.  We're going to go to break.  Regroup here.  As we go to break, in honor of the porn convention, these guys having fun.  We're going to go old school with a little track from our Dementor World CD. 
[02:41:00]  We haven't played this in a while.  It's called Hi, Mom.  I'm in porn.  There's too many men.  Too many people making too many problems.  And there's not much love to go around.  Can't you see this is a land of confusion?  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  This is the world we live in.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio. 
[02:41:30]  It's a virus.  It is spreading all over America and Canada, actually, as well.  Yes.  We haven't heard from the Canadians in a long time.  It's a build up there in Canada.  They're building.  And we're going to go to Toronto in the fall? 
[02:42:00]  Why in the fall?  Why don't we go July or August?  Spring.  Why not the dead of summer?  Summer?  Yeah.  I've never been in Canada in the summer.  How about we go in, ah, yeah, spring.  Late spring.  All right.  We'll go in late spring.  As long as it's not cold.  That's what I'm getting at.  I'm doing Aspen this year.  It's like March something, the comedy festival.  Why don't you guys broadcast from up there for a day?  In Colorado.  In Aspen, Colorado?  Sure.  I would love to go to Aspen, Colorado. 
[02:42:30]  Hang out in Aspen?  Why not?  Well, let's get that done.  That must be nice.  Yeah, I just thought of it.  Let's get that done.  That'll never happen.  Great.  Why wouldn't it happen?  I don't know.  It's just one of those things that sounds like a great idea, so it shouldn't happen.  Comedy festival?  There'll be a lot of comics.  Yeah, comics.  We should be at that comedy festival.  I completely agree.  We should be at the Montreal Comedy Festival every summer.  That's another great thing to be at.  Absolutely.  Can you get a direct flight to Aspen, or do you have to take one of those goddamn little  shaky planes?  I went once.  The little plane you take is not a little prop plane. 
[02:43:00]  It's fine.  I was comfortable with it on United.  I was comfortable.  Wow.  Years ago.  I don't know what else they have.  You went on it.  Yes.  Oh, that sells me.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm okay going in.  Oh, man.  We should try to figure that out.  That would be a good thing to do.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  We're doing the Super Bowls thing, or Super Bowl thing on Thursday.  We haven't heard from Matt, though, who took the mousetrap to the scrotum.  The video's up on Opie and Anthony.  It's been downloaded a lot.  Better not pussy out on us.  I don't know.  But that other guy, he's in. 
[02:43:30]  He's coming out Thursday.  And we have a promo now to hype the thing.  And it was made by Bill and Bobby.  Who's Bobby?  You're Bobby?  Bobby?  This is a lot of responsibility to put on interns, pretty much.  You're Bobby?  That's Bobby.  Hi.  I'm Opie.  And I hate the rain.  He just hit the light.  Yeah, fix that.  Wow.  You come flying in here. 
[02:44:00]  No, no.  The other way.  No, you got to push.  No, no, no.  Not that.  Don't pull that thing.  No, no.  No.  No.  Don't touch it.  Touch the bottom part, first of all.  Like down.  No, there.  There.  There.  Right there.  Unbelow.  Now turn.  Just sit down.  You got to sit down.  Turn it clockwise.  No, no, no.  Slightly.  See?  Not fucking nothing to light.  Too much.  No, no.  You are shaking the shit out of that.  You're a little nervous.  You ever work a light?  Never work a light.  Holy shit.  See?  All right.  Do it counterclockwise. 
[02:44:30]  Don't touch that part when you do it counterclockwise.  Clockwise is there.  Counter is up one.  Watch your headphones.  Your headphones are caught in a thing.  Your headphones are caught in a thing.  Counterclockwise.  Move the chair out of the way.  Yeah, watch out.  Oh, God.  All right.  All right.  Now, move in.  Now, don't touch the bottom part.  They're all nervous.  You're touching their lights.  Now, counterclockwise.  There you go.  This is you.  Counterclockwise.  All right.  Now you just fucking with me.  Oh, my God.  No, we're not just fucking with you.  That's clockwise.  Counterclockwise is this way.  The other way. 
[02:45:00]  Right.  All right.  Good.  Perfect.  That's it.  All right.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  Sit down, Bobby.  Now, how did you come to this show?  He just knocked the whole thing again.  I swear to God.  Yeah, dude, you keep holding your chair.  I swear to God.  What are you doing?  Watch it shaking.  Now it's on the cameraman.  Oh, my God, Bobby.  This isn't looking too good, is it?  No.  No.  Who cares?  It's never a good sign when the cameraman has to put down his camera. 
[02:45:30]  Now he's got to fix the light again.  Who cares?  It's 2020 and you're knocking the equipment around.  That's no big deal.  It's a local show.  Look how fast he does it.  Just a local show.  Oh, it's just 2020.  Just a local Earth show.  Yeah, I think it is only on this planet.  Yeah, you know.  All right.  Now, how did you come to us?  I was a Ron and Fez intern.  Right.  He was a Ron and Fez intern.  You're a Ron and Fez reject?  Yeah.  Well, it wasn't really a reject.  I thought I did good enough, you know, to work on both shows, actually. 
[02:46:00]  So how do you get that?  Like, whose job is it to say, hey, you work there now?  I wanted to continue my internship and Steve suggested that I go to the Opie and Anthony  show to help.  Oh, so Steve vouched for him.  You vouched for this guy.  I didn't necessarily vouch for him, but he wanted to.  The famous no one takes responsibility for shit around this place.  I knew that he had done well with Ron and Fez and he wanted to stay on. 
[02:46:30]  So keeping that in mind, yeah, I said, come on over.  But I didn't, I wasn't, we did tell him during the interview that he wasn't going to get any  special treatment, you know.  He's getting special treatment.  He's doing your promos.  Yeah.  He and Bill had actually asked a while ago if they could start writing stuff.  But that's special treatment.  That is special treatment.  What other intern could walk up to you?  See, he went from getting coffee to doing promos.  That's special treatment.  Yeah.  Wait till you hear it.  Doesn't matter.  It's still special.  Not necessarily.  Not necessarily.  I want to give him, you know, he's got to learn something.  This is in rotation, isn't it? 
[02:47:00]  It might have aired once.  I only finished it maybe half an hour ago.  Also, just because somebody's able to work on the Ron and Fez show does not necessarily  mean they'll be able to work with our show.  Retarded Paul, for instance, lasted his entire internship on Ron and Fez.  If he was here, he would have been thrown out a window within minutes.  Well, retarded Paul did ask if he could come over.  Oh, he did, did he?  Yeah, he did.  Yeah.  They both did.  And we said, Bobby, yeah.  Well, what's this promo about? 
[02:47:30]  This is promoting Thursday's Super Bowls contest.  And it's Bobby, formerly of the Ron and Fez show, and famous Bill.  Yo.  Who, Bill, is great with getting things, building things.  If you need something done in minutes, Bill will do it.  He's the go-to guy.  Yeah.  But I don't know, creatively, I've read some of his stuff.  I've read his script for the Opie and Anthony movie.  What?  A little creepy.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, Jimmy, you've got to read this.  It is so frightening. 
[02:48:00]  I could barely get through it.  He's got me, like, what was my character?  Like, I grew up...  Like the guy from Oliver Twist.  Yeah.  Unlike the other kid from Oliver Twist.  The one that taught him how to pick pockets and stuff.  Yeah, that guy.  What?  Who, Fagin?  Nazi Fagin or whatever his name was?  The Dodger?  No, Artful Dodger or something.  Oh.  That's what he's got me, growing up, like I was on the streets at seven years old, pick 
[02:48:30]  and pocket.  That was just an example.  You never actually read my real script.  Oh, that was the fake one you gave me?  That was just a throwaway thing that my friend and I wrote together.  All right, what's the real script?  That's a good thing to do at pitch meetings.  You hand it to them.  We don't like it.  Well, that's not it.  Someone handed it to them.  I was just showing someone else.  All right, listen, Bill.  You've got one minute to describe or explain the Opie and Anthony movie.  Okay.  The real one.  The real one.  Oh, that movie?  Yeah.  That was a joke.  There's no...  No, the real one.  Why are you sweating so bad?  Holy sweat like a pig.  You have the worst...  I ran here from like 48th and Madison.  I was almost going... 
[02:49:00]  I have school in 20 minutes.  So I...  Bobby calls me...  I've never seen him nervous before.  He's got the worst pig stains ever.  Bill's nervous.  He's got like a sweat on the forehead.  He's...  I ran here.  Yeah, whatever.  All right.  Good.  Whatever.  He's nervous that you're not going to like his promo, so he's...  No, the promo I can't care about.  I know that promo's genius.  Oh, see?  So no matter what we say...  Screw the movie thing.  Okay.  Let's get into the promo.  Let's get into the promo.  We'll do the movie thing next time you're here, okay?  I like...  This is the...  It looks professional, though.  This is the way you want to hand it in.  You could keep that in. 
[02:49:30]  There's like notes on the back.  Oh, it's...  I read some of it.  I was stunned.  It was a joke, and it was never meant to be read.  All right.  All right.  So you guys did a promo for the Super Bowl thing we're doing Thursday?  Yeah, those balls, guy.  It's in the form of a monster truck promo, so you have to take that into consideration.  Let's take that into consideration, then.  All right.  And why did you recruit Bobby?  Bobby and I do a lot of good work together, and so we're like a comedy team, maybe?  Oh, yeah, sure. 
[02:50:00]  Something like that.  Yeah, me and Bill did work.  Ron and Fez, we did work, and then any time he needed to work for Obi and Anthony, I would  help him, so we're pretty much like, I guess, the intern team around here.  Inseparable.  You could call it that, Jim.  All right.  Here's the problem.  Is this like Earth 2 bit?  No.  No?  Here's the promo.  The following promo was written by interns.  Thursday.  Oh!  Okay.  He puts a disclaimer.  Steve.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah.  Steve puts a fucking disclaimer on there because he doesn't want to take responsibility for it. 
[02:50:30]  You bet your ass I don't want to take responsibility.  But he's saying it's brilliant.  Yes.  Don't you see brilliance when it's right in front of you?  I love it.  It's brilliant in the way that John Criffalusi, who made When Stimpy, was brilliant.  That type of brilliant.  Wow.  You're really going with the brilliance.  Dude, I love the way everyone is petrified around this place.  No place works better than a place full of fear.  And Steve felt he wanted to put a disclaimer because he was afraid he would have to be responsible for this. 
[02:51:00]  Well, my voice is on it.  It would be one thing if they actually voiced it, but they wanted me to voice and produce this whole thing.  This place is like run like Stalin is running.  It's just everyone's afraid that the next person that screws up gets thrown out a window.  I was all nervous before with the audio.  Did you cut it up?  Did you listen to it?  Is it good?  Yeah.  Is it good?  No one wants to fail on this show.  No.  All right.  Well, we know it's not you, Steve.  So, Steve, you put the disclaimer in case it's not good.  Correct.  All right.  Here we go.  The following promo was written by interns. 
[02:51:30]  Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, February 2nd.  Opie and Anthony, the shock jocks who are so extreme to the core they force their listeners to have sex in a church,  present the most extremely awesome event in satellite radio history, the first annual Super Bowl.  Man, I can't wait to see the Seahawks play the Steelers.  Wrong, douchebag.  Reigning champ Matt, the pill-popping construction worker, will defend his balls of steel against the revenge-seeking pride of Puerto Rico,  the Connecticut king of cock, Raphael.  Yeah, it's gonna be cocks.  Open-handedly beat your kids to sleep. 
[02:52:00]  Sock your significant other in the face.  Kick your boss where he wears his yarmulke.  And brace yourself for some really, really straight, non-homosexual balls-to-the-wall action.  Fuck yeah, scream for the match.  It's gonna be an all-out, nut-bashing, cocks-clashing, high-heels-stomping, big-fucking, big-ball-busting bonanza.  Shit, fuck, cut, cocksucker.  Motherfucker.  This is your Sultan of Smut, Steve Zee.  God bless America.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wow.  To me, that sounds 1% in turn, 99% Steve Zee. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  He voiced it.  I told you I voiced it.  They wrote it.  Oh, they wrote all things.  They voiced it.  So you, just like a robot, went in there and voiced it.  Right.  Okay.  Okay.  I took their script, which was very specific.  All the sound effects were outlined in a script, and everything has its place.  It's very deliberate.  All right.  You liked it, to a point.  Because it's your...  You gave it an energy.  And you decide if we're gonna run it or not.  I didn't want to...  I'm not gonna produce a half-assed piece of production, you know, even if they, you know, 
[02:53:00]  they wrote it.  You know, ho, ho, ho.  Grr.  Grr.  Grr.  Yeah.  I'll tell you the one line I didn't like, though, in the beginning, when it says,  Opie and Anthony, the shock jocks, who were so extreme, it was just too long.  What?  With the sex in the church thing.  Was that in there?  Yeah.  Sex in the church.  You know what?  It's not that bad.  It's not all that bad.  I didn't say it was all that bad.  I didn't think it was that.  And as far as the monster truck thing goes, it's a very good parody of that. 
[02:53:30]  I like when you lose your mind and just curse crazy.  That's very funny.  Thank you.  Is that you?  Yeah.  Yeah, because it's just completely out of conduct.  It's one of those, just because it's high energy, it's someone exploding like that.  And I kind of thought that was funny.  See, Steve, they do get it.  I'm glad.  I said there's a line here between Steve saying it's fucking an Ed Wood production and Bill  painting it like it's Woody Allen's moose bit.  I think there's a balance in there somewhere.  I think it's somewhere in that gray area lies the truth. 
[02:54:00]  You just made a Woody Allen moose bit reference?  That's amazing.  Well, that's the most, like, when you think of...  That's his most famous...  It's a brilliantly written piece of comedy.  There's no other.  I could say the Jim Norton, Liz Taylor, Harry hat thing, but that's just too self-serving.  Can't stand Woody Allen.  It's going to.  Is it a stand-up?  Oh, I can't stand him on any level.  Did you ever hear a stand-up?  His movie, yes, I've heard his stand-up.  It's awful on the comedy channel.  He's the best.  Hold on.  It made me want to throw my XM down the toilet, buy a Sirius, and fuck your mother. 
[02:54:30]  Raphael from Connecticut has a problem with the promo.  Raphael, he's going to be one of the contestants in Super Bowl on Thursday.  Yes.  Yes, the promo was fine and all, but I am not Puerto Rican.  I am an Italian.  Yeah, we didn't know what nationality you were, so based on Raphael, we just assumed it was  Puerto Rican.  We took a shot.  Yeah, good assumption.  Yeah, of course.  Right.  I thought that's a bad thing.  Just wanted to clarify that up.  Other than that, promo sounds good.  Yeah, we'd hate to mix up the ethnicity when you put your scrotum on a fucking mouse glue 
[02:55:00]  trap.  You're right, Jimmy.  You're right.  Hey, uh, wait, no.  What's up, what's up, what's up?  Hold on.  We got Matt, who you're going up against.  You guys have not talked on the radio together yet, right?  No.  Yeah, Matt was the one that stole your bit, came in here, was very successful with it,  and now the video is all over the world.  It's being downloaded everywhere.  We have Matt on the line.  He's taking on Raphael this Thursday in Super Bowl.  Matt.  Yeah.  What's going on?  What's going on?  Sorry to call back earlier.  Raphael, what do you have to say to Matt? 
[02:55:30]  Your balls look small on video.  He's talking some smack.  Little bull smack.  Ramone, this man has AIDS.  That's all you got, buddy.  My fucking balls are made of fucking steel, you motherfucker.  Really, really?  I like that New York accent you got there.  I'm sorry, not from CT like you're from.  NYC.  You don't even know how to spell your fucking state, you asshole.  You don't even know how to spell it?  I heard you.  I'll be like, CT versus NYC. 
[02:56:00]  What the fuck is that?  Get a fucking book.  Get a book.  Wait till I teabag you.  You tried me, buddy.  I already put my fucking balls in there.  You didn't do shit.  You just fucking sat home and jerked off to it.  This is the worst shit-talking session I've ever heard.  Oh, my gosh.  Goddamn Puerto Ricans.  They're trying so hard to talk smack.  Oh, it's awful.  Why don't you go to a library?  Yeah, I'll bet you go to a mall once.  CT.  Yeah, what's with that state?  Two and two letters.  Bet you can't spell it. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  Ooh, that is tough.  You know what?  I'm going to let my balls do the talking on Thursday.  That's all.  Ah, let your balls do the talking.  And hopefully they'll say, hey, why are we detached from that body?  All right.  So, Matt and Raphael, what do you got planned for your balls, though?  You got to bring in your own torture devices.  Oh, I do?  Okay.  I didn't know that.  Yeah, you got to be creative here, people.  Hmm.  All right.  Raphael's bringing in glue traps.  Oh, well, it's spammy.  Now, that doesn't sound very painful unless, Raphael, he is Italian, so I'm thinking hairy 
[02:57:00]  balls, and that might hurt ripping it off.  Yes, right?  Or how about this?  I'm not sure.  Go ahead.  If one of you is uncut, you take the glue trap, and you put your dickhead with the foreskin  on the glue trap, and then you peel it back off with the helmet caught in it.  We're not a double strap.  I don't know how involved the dick is going to be.  This is a ball contest.  Open the cock hole, and just put the corner of the paper inside, or you get the paper  cut across the head.  Stop it!  Yeah.  Well, Raphael said earlier that he's willing to do a piercing, right? 
[02:57:30]  Yes, sir.  I'll pierce my balls.  All right.  Matt, what do you got for that?  What do I got for that?  I could pierce.  I could do a double trap on my fucking cock.  A double mouse trap?  Double mouse trap on each side of my scrotum.  And Raphael, what do you say to that?  I could do a double, also, and I'll throw an electric mouse trap.  Oh, I know.  Electric.  All right.  You guys don't talk until he does something, so I want to see him do something.  Matt, what do you say to that?  What do I say to that? 
[02:58:00]  I'll dip my scrotum into some Icy Hot or whatever you guys got over there.  You know what?  I'll bring it all in.  Yeah, Icy Hot.  Do we have electric mouse trap?  Not yet.  Raphael, what do you say to that?  Let's do it, yeah.  Icy Hot, no problem.  All right.  Let's do it, motherfucker.  This is going to be the worst contest ever.  If one of them takes the electric mouse trap to the nutsack, I'll be floored, because people  were just sticking their fingers in there, and it was hurting. 
[02:58:30]  Yeah, Nathaniel had a tough time with that.  Yeah.  A couple months back.  So to shock your testicle.  All right.  Game on Thursday.  It's Raphael from Connecticut and Matt from New York City.  They're doing the Super Bowl.  That's right.  It's coming Thursday on the Opie and Anthony program.  That's right.  Lucky us.  All right, guys.  All right.  See you Thursday.  All right.  You've got to work on your trash talking.  We want to, like, you know, build this up all week.  We had a big monster truck type promo running, and then you two can't talk smack with each 
[02:59:00]  other.  Yeah.  You guys stay on hold.  We've got to get info from you.  All right.  You think the driver of Gravedigger and the driver of Bigfoot stand there face to face  and just go, yeah, yeah, where are you from?  Huh?  Bet you can't spill your state.  XM says no electric mousetraps.  Why?  I don't know.  When we were on the phone with DC last week, they told us, yeah, go ahead.  Just nothing with electricity.  It's low voltage.  It's batteries.  Or it's high voltage, low amperage.  How bad could the electricity be if it's batteries?  It just kills the mouse.  Exactly.  That's a lot for your balls. 
[02:59:30]  Why no electricity?  Do you want to?  I don't know.  I don't know.  They just said no.  I would assume it would be dangerous.  It's a grand invention.  Been around for years.  Well, God, we need something that's dangerous.  Maybe they could sit on marshmallows and we could all just sit around and laugh.  Aw, that would be cute.  Yeah.  Jesus.  See how many Cocoa Puffs you can pick up.  Right.  I know.  It's like a stupid contest.  The answer was because it's dangerous.  Well, isn't that the whole theme of this contest? 
[03:00:00]  It's not fun unless there's an element of danger to a guy's balls.  I have an idea.  Maybe a guy could just tickle his testicles gently and we can all point and laugh.  That'll work.  No.  Although he might feel bad.  The lawyers don't want him.  How about this?  Maybe the lawyers, maybe the contest can change.  Emotional pain.  That's what we can go for.  You're not valid.  Ooh.  Ooh.  All right.  A little self-esteem.  Yeah.  Well, Bobby, good job at the promo bill. 
[03:00:30]  You guys liked it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wasn't as bad as there was that it was.  It's not as bad as Steve.  Well, it was original.  We didn't want to do ONA Party Rock.  I don't pump it up now.  Yeah.  We gave you credit for it.  Exactly.  Don't now start pumping it up.  Like it was Citizen Kane.  Well, you know, it was all the camera work.  It was the shadows.  And you watched the light.  But with these two guys, the best part of the whole contest is going to be the promo.  Unfortunately.  It wasn't a joke.  It was the best part of the promo.  No.  It was a joke.  It was a joke. 
[03:01:00]  You can't pull the joke away after it's out and say it's not a joke.  It wasn't a joke.  Keep talking.  Anthony says it was a joke.  It was a joke.  That's how it works in this room.  I don't know how it is from 10 to 2.  I got to go to 10 to 11 to 2.  Bobby, they're saying you have to go.  So why don't you do that?  It was great.  There you go.  Now relax.  I listened to Bobby on the Ron and Fez show, and he was pretty high up on the totem pole.  Was he?  He's being knocked down a couple of notches on the Opie and Anthony show.  He looks like the one intern that we used to have. 
[03:01:30]  Who was the one guy we used to have?  Stupid.  Stupid number one.  Stupid number eight.  That guy was a dummy, too.  I don't remember who he is.  Look at him trying to get past the light now.  Stop being so ginger.  Just go.  I've been seeing him forever.  Jesus.  There he goes.  You moved it, by the way.  Look at the cord.  Look at the cord.  Let's go to Jason in Indiana.  He's a new prescriber, according to the screen here.  Jason.  Jason.  Yeah.  What's up?  No, man.  You guys are some funny fuckers.  Hold on.  Stupid Bill just tripped over a light. 
[03:02:00]  Bill just hit the light.  These guys are fucking mutants.  I've been listening to you guys for about a month on DirecTV.  I'm going out and getting me an XM radio this weekend.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  Very good.  Thank you.  So you've been listening, and you haven't, you haven't, what is that, to the service?  Subscribed.  Yeah, we'll go out and get me an XM radio this weekend.  All right.  Sorry, Jim.  I got a good idea for that ball thing.  What?  Good idea?  What?  Yeah, fucking make them shave their sack, dry shave it, and dump lemon juice on it. 
[03:02:30]  Dry shave and then lemon juice.  Yeah.  That sounds a little nasty.  You've tried this?  No way.  How do you know it works, then?  Because lemon juice burns in paper cuts.  It's got to hurt when you dry shave it and dump it.  Wow.  So what is it now?  You listened on DirecTV, and then what did you decide to do with XM?  I'm going to go buy an XM radio.  Yeah, but you know, you can't just buy it.  You have to get the service.  Yeah.  Yeah, you know, you have to fill in the blank.  What's the word I'm looking for? 
[03:03:00]  God, I can't.  Are you not an idiot?  No, you have to sign up for the service.  You have to.  You do the same thing for magazines, I think, and newspapers.  Prescribe to it?  Yes.  What is that?  Prescribe?  Yes, that's the word I was looking for.  One more time, sir.  Prescribe?  Yes, prescribe to it.  Yes.  That's what I was looking for.  Do you have any prescriptions already?  I see what you're saying.  I said subscription earlier.  Yes, earlier you said subscription.  That's because it took too many. 
[03:03:30]  But it's prescribed, right.  All right.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Later.  There goes Jason.  Makes us feel better about ourselves when we can point out how stupid others are.  Yes.  Yeah, that's pretty much the object of this program.  In LA, I was at my friend's house, and I did actually check you out on DirecTV for a few  minutes.  It was really bizarre.  Flipping to two, and then one back.  One back.  Right there.  Sorry, yapping.  Yeah, it was kind of weird.  When you make that mistake, and you think you're going up a channel, and you go down one,  and there we are.  Well, 30 seconds, or not even, 10 seconds after I was on it, I heard, like, you know,  fucking cocksucker.  And I'm like, this is what people do.  They flip back.  They hear something outrageous for a second. 
[03:04:00]  They're like, whoa, what is this?  I don't see any picture, but I have to listen.  Just dirty mouths.  It's been working.  Yeah.  So, are you guys going to be able to use any of this footage, 2020 people?  Come on.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  For B-roll?  Oh, yeah.  Like, what is going to be on 2020 from this part of the segment?  Be honest.  Be completely honest with us.  Well, we wanted to come here to introduce the audience to Jim Norton, and then we're going  to take him out to Times Square with a hidden camera today.  Right.  And he's going to be cursing in front of people that aren't expecting it. 
[03:04:30]  Right.  And then we'll see if there are hours about rudeness.  So, we want to see how they react.  But what part of this are you going to be using?  Jim had a couple of good jags there about his car rental episode was good, and you guys  were...  Well, he's cursing maybe a little bit, right?  No, they don't want the cursing.  They don't want the cursing, right?  Well, we'll end up bleeping everything, but...  Yeah.  Yeah.  I would assume they'd have to bleep.  So, basically, this has been a big waste of time. 
[03:05:00]  No, no, it hasn't been, because I'll tell you exactly what this is going to be used  for.  All right.  The day we fuck up again and get fired, they will have all this footage of us to use and  run on how the two idiot DJs did it again, and here they are.  Exclusive footage.  That's what all it is, but it's going in the vault somewhere and gets tagged for the next  time we fuck up and lose our jobs.  All right.  Because it will happen.  It's happened two times before. 
[03:05:30]  It's the only way we can end this career of ours.  All right.  Let's move on to Hans, the trucker.  Hans.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Hans.  Hi, Hans.  Sweet cheeks.  Hi.  Hey, are you guys going to do like a wiffle butt challenge pretty soon, get off this gay  shit?  Great bitch you guys are doing, but come on now.  Well, sir, gays are a part of our society, and if we decide to talk about it for a day,  I see no problem in that.  I can't wait to see on the message board. 
[03:06:00]  You know, as soon as Norton gets back, they start talking about the gay stuff.  Can I throw in a disclaimer?  That character that you were doing is Opie's character, Angry Typing Guy.  I wasn't.  That was not.  You must ask permission.  That was definitely Angry Typing Guy.  That was Angry Typing Guy.  Anthony asked permission before he does.  Angry Typing Guy.  I would never just do.  It's Opie's character.  And you'd have to do this better.  Because I wasn't doing, I was doing.  And you didn't put your hands into it.  Exactly.  I'm not doing Angry, I'm a deaf guy who's a little informed improperly. 
[03:06:30]  How come this?  See, you're different.  You pecked a different.  My guy types well.  I'm picking out.  All right.  Thank you.  My guy types well.  My deaf guy has fluid typing.  Just trying to get the gay out of the show.  This will do it.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck me with that big cock.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:07:00]  Oh.  Cleanse the palate.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck me.  Oh, God.  Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.  Who is this?  It's awful.  It really is bad.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that gritty voice.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh, fuck, yes.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Someone's raping the nanny.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck me.  Give me that fucking cock. 
[03:07:30]  Push harder.  Yeah.  Push it harder.  Oh, fuck, yes.  Oh.  Oh, God, yes.  It's not sexy.  Oh, God.  Oh, oh, fuck.  Oh.  Okay, terrific.  I bring nothing to the table.  Oh.  That was the guy talking?  I would have been more turned on listening to Jean Stapleton get her cervix checked.  I think that's what that was.  That was fucking awful.  Oh, overacting in porn wrecks it. 
[03:08:00]  If a girl tried that shit with me, I would lose my erection immediately.  Hey, this is a good question from Joe.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, Jimmy said he had some audio of himself doing one of those screaming orgasms.  I was just wondering.  I know this isn't getting the gay out of the show, but what about it, Jim?  Do you know, I almost, I thought of that earlier in the show because they were talking about  my weight loss, and I was thinking about, there's a video from years ago of me being  blown, and I just, how bad my stomach looks in it, but I have audio of me coming, which  I will bring in.  You don't want that. 
[03:08:30]  Yes, you do.  Why?  The audio, not the video.  Is it long, or is it short?  I don't remember.  It was just like, it was just the echo.  You gotta bring that in.  It was awful.  Oh.  You gotta bring that in.  It's awful.  I don't know if I ever want to hear that.  Dude, it's really, I'm stuck here.  Mike from Connecticut.  Okay, Mike.  You hear a guy's voice go, bye.  No.  Huh, Mike?  I got something about the ball thing.  Oh, the Super Bowl, this coming Thursday.  That's right.  You guys gotta get rock'em, sock'em robots.  Have the guy droop his ball bag in between and just beat the shit out of him. 
[03:09:00]  Wow, that's really funny.  That conjures up an image.  Working the speed bag with the rock'em, sock'em robots.  Hey, that's kind of funny, man.  All right, guys, punch it out.  All right, Randy from New York knows that last orgasm clip.  Randy.  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Yo, I heard right before that woman had that orgasm, she did karaoke of Bobby McGee.  That is not funny, sir.  I didn't get it for a second.  Aaron, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday there, Jimmy.  Had an idea for the ball bag. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  What you do is you take a C-clamp, and you get it nice and tight, and then they take turns  making one full revolution on the handle.  They did it in the military.  You're going to get about two turns, and you're done.  Now, is this on a testy or on the sack?  Just one.  All right.  How could you get a rotation off of that?  Of what?  I could see on the bag itself, you take a C-clamp and get it so it's just finger tight on  a testy, and then you slowly, you could even do, like, quarter turn at a time, and then 
[03:10:00]  the other guy's got to do a quarter turn, and then you go, and you keep going until somebody  taps out.  That's it.  That's really bad.  That is really not good.  All right.  Let's go to Tony the Trucker.  Now we're getting the ideas coming in.  Tony.  Hey, what's up, boys?  How you doing?  All right, Tony.  All right, man.  A couple for you.  You know, fuck that C-clamp.  What you got to do?  Get some vice grips and clip them on there.  Just let them motherfuckers dangle there for a little bit, man.  Vice grips and vice grips.  Ain't even looking to, like, a gun gun. 
[03:10:30]  And if he's going to pierce his balls, let him hang a Christmas ornament from her.  Tattoo his balls with the ONA virus.  There you go.  This guy's thinking.  This guy's got a whole slew of them.  All right, Tony.  How about you get a rat and let him, like, nibble food off your balls?  I was at my friend's house in L.A., and she has two rats.  What do you mean she has two rats?  Pets.  Pet rats.  Are you kidding?  No, I got actually video.  I let a rat crawl up the outside of my pant leg.  Why?  To get laid?  No, no.  I didn't have sex with her.  But I was saying the rat, one of them would walk by and nibble my arm like they just pressure 
[03:11:00]  bite you.  You know more girls you don't fuck.  I do.  That's awful.  Anyone I know.  And you're in, like, situations where you're alone.  You're in situations that should end in a fucking.  If you knew how close I came to land on a hot one in L.A., but I blew it because I'm a rookie.  I blew it because I'm a rookie.  What do you mean, a rookie?  You've been with no hookers.  I was way out of my league here.  Way out of my league.  She was really hot.  Dude, way out of my league.  How did you blow it? 
[03:11:30]  I didn't want to just bang her.  I liked her.  But I just...  You wanted some type of relationship?  I don't know what I wanted, but I fucking blew it.  I just blew it because I'm a rookie.  And I blew it.  You had to know there was a...  You got to explain.  Where was the point?  How was the buildup?  What happened that you fucked up?  I want to know.  I was just, like...  Because I knew I was leaving L.A.  So, like, she would say, call me.  And I would always call her, like, in a couple of days when she would say, give me a call.  Oh, that's horrible.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  She said, call me, and you called.  Wow, you did fuck that up.  But there's a game you play with a really hot chick where you can't act really interested. 
[03:12:00]  You know that's the reality.  Oh, my God.  What about honesty?  What about, yeah, you're a hot chick.  I'm interested.  You tell me to call you, and I'm going to call you?  No, no, no.  But when somebody says, when a hot chick gets hit on by fucking...  Here's what I realized.  I'm a weenie.  I'm a fucking weenie.  You're a weenie.  Dude.  It was like, when a hot chick like that, every guy she meets wants to fuck her.  Every guy is asking her out.  So, like, what keeps her interested is if you're something a little bit different. 
[03:12:30]  A little bit different.  A little bit.  How about yourself?  You, as an individual, are much different than the guys that probably hit on you.  You're right.  But what happens is when you're so easily available for somebody, they lose interest.  It's a reality.  I'm the same way.  If somebody is so readily available, I'm like, eh.  So what happens is when somebody says, call me, and then every other day you call them,  not every day, but, like, you call them on schedule, and you're always ready to hang  out with them, you're never not available.  That person will be like, eh, where's anything interesting about this?  But what about when you do call, and you're being interesting, you're going out and doing 
[03:13:00]  things that are fun for that person and yourself, and you're, then that would make her want you  to call her.  As a friend, yes.  As a friend.  Hey, this guy's fun to be with.  He's a good guy, but he's no challenge at all.  That does play into it, though.  It does play into it.  Chicks like that, it does play into it.  There has to be a certain element, and I didn't have time to play the game because I was coming  back to New York.  So I was like, I was more honest.  That was more honest.  I wanted to call her, so I called.  Yeah. 
[03:13:30]  I was being honest, and you know what it got me?  What?  A one-way ticket to Weeniesville.  What, uh, so you called her, and then what happened, what started happening?  Like, you weren't getting it, you were getting the machine, or?  No, no, she would always call me back.  I mean, she was never, like, cunty or anything.  She's cool, but, I mean, I think she just liked me as a friend, and I'm just fucking, I  was, I really wanted to shoot myself.  Nothing made, it was not about her.  It was about what a zilch I am.  Every time I like a chick for the right reasons, I get the fucking fun routine.  But you were on a time-constrained thing going on. 
[03:14:00]  You were coming back to New York, you knew it.  Right.  So that kind of blew it for you, more than you blowing it, or her being what she's all  about.  Yeah.  It was more like just a geography that fucked you up.  Well, meaning, I wasn't looking for anything to happen.  I wasn't even looking to bang her.  It was like, but sometimes you want to know the person has some interest, and then, all right,  you see where it goes, eventually down the road.  But the person just had no interest.  No interest.  See, but you say she calls you back.  You don't understand relationships is what it is.  You have a lack of understanding of a normal relationship.  It usually does start out with going out to places. 
[03:14:30]  Absolutely.  Not maybe as a friend, like, you know, 10 years later, you're still friends type friend.  But it starts that way, and then it builds from there.  I agree.  But you have to at least know the other person has some kind of interest in you, other than  friendship.  She seemed like there was, and not necessarily.  As long as there's an interest there.  See, you automatically think, bah, I'm in the fucking friend category.  Just because you're not fucking that night? 
[03:15:00]  No.  Or there isn't this flirtatious thing going on?  Not even a peck on the lips.  Like, not even, like, little, I've been dated enough to know when you, like, I asked,  all right, how long, how many times did you hang out with your girl before you kissed  at all?  Not even made out, just, like, a little bit of a, because there's a point where I was  like, all right, she's a really hot chick.  Every guy she hangs with tries to fuck her.  It's a reality for her.  So I don't want to be a scumbag.  I'm trying to be respectful.  So how long do you hang out before you at least let the person know, like, yeah, I am like  every other jerk off that, you know, I'm interested. 
[03:15:30]  Do you understand?  There's like a line.  You have to try to walk that balance.  And I didn't kiss her at all.  I pecked her on the cheek a little bit, but I just, I got the vibe.  Then she started going to school.  She got really busy.  She's just not interested in me in that way.  And it was like.  You'd be a better judge because you were there.  Yeah.  I'm just saying, I think you have this misconception about a real relationship, something you said  you've been looking for.  I do.  I just, I Googled my ex-girlfriend from years ago.  I'm not going to say her name.  Just, just to do it. 
[03:16:00]  Google her in the ass or what?  You Googled.  I saw a picture of her.  She was fucking beautiful.  It was so.  Really?  It really bugged me.  I was like, please God, let her be fat.  You don't want that.  Oh, she fucking looked good, man.  So yeah.  No, but it wasn't about sex though.  It's like, but whenever I seem to like a girl for the right reasons.  Yeah.  They just, do I subconsciously pick chicks that I know aren't going to like me to like?  Like girls that I think are funny.  This girl actually made me laugh.  She was funny.  Like when I think a girl is funny or I like them, then they want to be buddies.  That sounds great. 
[03:16:30]  But do you understand what I'm saying though?  It's like when I, the picture is like, oh, you don't like us for the right reasons.  But when I do, I get like fucking, it's not about sex.  We got some advice from Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Hey, what's up guys?  Hey.  Yeah.  Jimmy, next time you see yourself falling in the friend zone, you know, all you got  to do is buy a motorcycle, join the Navy.  You know, you don't want to like.  What a callback.  This is one of the greatest callbacks in Opie and Anthony history.  Buy a motorcycle and join the Navy.  And then maybe get a job fucking at a checkout thing, putting stickers on milk.  Produce.  Yeah.  Milk.  That whole story.  All right, Rob. 
[03:17:00]  That poor son of a bitch.  He was so in love with a girl.  And he was the pro, he was the guy that used to put the prices on produce and milk aisle at  the grocery store.  And he was in love with this girl and fell into the friend zone.  And in one night at a bar, his best friend and roommate picked her up.  He was in the Navy and out of motorcycle.  I thought there was a connection in that way.  I thought he would live downstairs.  Yeah, but they weren't.  Because he listened to him fucking her.  Yeah, but they weren't friends.  There wasn't a best friend part.  Motorcycle guy?  Yeah, I don't think motorcycle guy would. 
[03:17:30]  Just live downstairs?  Yeah.  So he takes her home.  And bangs her.  And bangs her.  And he got to hear this girl he was in love with fucking Navy motorcycle guy.  When he just thought she was just a nice girl.  Yeah.  How awful is that, man?  That's a great story.  This fucking.  Oh, there's so much heartbreak out there, man.  It really bummed me out.  It did?  Did it really bum me out for a while?  It wasn't about sex, though.  Yeah, it really wasn't.  And she's hot.  She's hot.  It wasn't about sex.  She's fun to be with.  You were feeling a little of that love there, Jimmy. 
[03:18:00]  I don't know if it was love.  I can't be that upset.  I don't think I was in love with it.  It wasn't lust, though.  It was a little bit on the line.  How often did you think about her every day?  A lot.  She popped into your head a lot?  Yeah, like we hung out a few times.  The first time we hung out.  You were close, man.  The first time we hung out, she brought her roommates.  So I'm like, oh, this sucks.  But then it actually worked out to be really comfortable.  We all had a good time and got along.  And maybe she's been in a lot of situations where you run out of conversations, too much pressure.  So the three of us, I had a really good time.  So the next time we hung out, we wound up going like we went to lunch.  Casual.  You know, let's go to lunch. 
[03:18:30]  It's not dinner.  And then I'm like, let's go to this other place.  We're going to go to this place and walk around kind of like a mall.  And she's like, let's go to the beach.  So I'm like, I'm such a coward.  Not doing anything.  I'm like, no.  That's kind of a sexy place to go, Jimmy.  Well, I'm following her in the car.  And I'm like, what are you, a fucking idiot?  You dumb motherfucker.  Stop being such a coward and go.  So we get to this other parking deck.  I'm like, you know what?  Let's go.  So we go to the beach.  We're walking around Venice.  We sit on the beach.  We're chatting, getting along well.  We wound up going out to dinner.  That's romantic. 
[03:19:00]  You're in the romance zone.  Now you're, how do you?  All right, keep talking.  I'll tell you.  Because afterwards, at the end, we spent 10 hours together.  10 hours.  She winds up inviting me up to her apartment with her roommates there.  Her roommate's there.  It wasn't a sex thing.  Okay.  No, I'm not.  We're still with you.  You don't even have to say it's not a sex thing.  No, no.  I mean, I didn't think she was inviting me up for sex.  Like, when you hear that, like, at the end of the date, dude, she invited you up.  But again, she knew her roommate would be there.  So it was a safe place.  And that's what I'm thinking.  Like, oh, okay, maybe this is the beach and stuff.  But earlier, she had said how much she loves the beach. 
[03:19:30]  She just loves going to the beach.  She just likes the beach.  It was like a fucking, I'm telling you, it was a friendship thing.  You're picking every little thing out as something negative towards you instead of, like, the roommate was there.  Even though she invited me up, the roommate was there.  So that meant, oh, the beach.  It's very romantic.  But even though she just likes the beach.  No, I'm actually, I know it sounds like I'm doing that, but what I'm really doing is looking at it realistically because I was looking at the positives.  Like, oh, my God, she wound up inviting me up.  And then she spent 10 hours with me.  But you know what?  It really was just because she enjoyed hanging out. 
[03:20:00]  That was it.  That was it.  You're a fucking weenie.  I'm a fucking one-way ticket to Weeniesville.  That's exactly where I live.  Fucking what a wiener.  Next stop, Weenieville.  Next stop, Weenieville.  All off at Weenieville.  I have to drive an Oscar Mayer car.  That's where I could pick her up in.  God, am I an asshole?  And I'll tell you, it's embarrassing.  Don't say it. 
[03:20:30]  This is how I know she wants to be friends.  I, uh, we hung a couple times.  And again, she was starting school, so I knew she was going to be really busy.  And she was.  And I respect the fact that she was going to class and just, it was hours, whatever.  So I didn't see her, like, the last week I was there.  But she knew I was going back, and she really didn't make any effort.  To get together and hang.  And then, like, the final night, we're going to the wrap party.  So I'm like, hey.  I called up.  I'm like, you know what?  Fuck this.  I'm going to make this known that I like her.  Because, again, I can't go back to New York wondering about this shit.  So I call up.  I'm like, do you want to, uh, listen, I'm going to this wrap party. 
[03:21:00]  I'm like, you know, do you want to be my date for the wrap party?  I kind of, it was kind of casual.  Yeah.  But she's like, you know, she, I didn't, nah, I don't really feel like being around people  and everything.  I just.  Oh, boy.  Ooh, ow.  All right.  That might have been a good.  That was the indicator.  So you used the word date.  On purpose.  On purpose.  Absolutely.  And her excuse, real spur of the moment was, I don't like being around people.  No, she's like, I don't really.  That really was a great, that was exactly what I felt inside.  But she's like, why don't you come by and we'll grab something to eat before you go. 
[03:21:30]  Or she would have seen me after.  Uh-huh.  But again, that friendship thing.  No, I'm not.  And.  Yeah.  So, no, I'm always right about that stuff.  It's chilling.  That blows.  How good I am at fucking that stuff.  And now have you spoken with her since?  No, I'll probably never talk to her again.  Never talk to her again.  But not to be.  She's a nice girl.  She didn't do anything wrong.  I just.  She didn't leave me on.  Yes, she did.  Nah, man.  She's just.  She hurt my little Jimmy.  Dude, she did exactly what she should have done.  I got called up to the majors.  I was not even in like fucking.  What's the one right before? 
[03:22:00]  Triple A?  I was in fucking.  Double A's.  I was playing college baseball.  And I got fucking called up to the Yankees.  Because eight people ahead of me got hurt.  And I fucking.  I get up to the plate.  And I fucking swung at a pitch that bounced in the dirt.  And the bat flew out of my hand.  And that was striking.  That's your memory of the major leagues.  Dude.  Not only did I swing at a pitch in the dirt.  I let the bat go.  And then I'm still trying to convince myself that you know what?  Man fucking George was watching. 
[03:22:30]  He saw that I took a good cut at the ball.  I got hearty.  No, I got nothing but a one-way trip back to college to play baseball there.  And I'll never play in the majors.  And I don't deserve to play in the majors swinging like that.  Jeter would have laid off the pitch.  He would have let it go by.  He would have showed patience, which would have made that pitcher come for him.  But not me.  All fat tits, swings at the ball in the dirt, and throws the bat.  So why should the pitcher put in any effort?  Oh, God.  Is that a sorry story?  Do you want to be my date for the rap party? 
[03:23:00]  And it's not like be my date for, you know, the get-together of the trash collector's union that you're doing.  This is a rap party for a series you're in.  On HBO?  Yeah.  Jimmy really liked this girl because he called me out of nowhere.  I'm at my niece's birthday party.  Jamie's little birthday party.  She's like six.  Phone rings on a Friday night, Saturday night.  I knew I was finished.  He was asking me for advice, and when did you know with Lindsay, and all this stuff.  Oh, God, like Obie's in the tower. 
[03:23:30]  You're trying to be talked in.  Keep your nose up.  All right, a little more aileron, a left aileron.  Flops, flops.  No, it was like Obie was in the bushes, and I'm like leaning my ear in.  Yeah.  I forgot what you asked me, but you asked me a question, I gave you the answer, and you went, oh, really?  Yeah.  Like you were so disappointed that my answer was such.  Yeah, but I had to because I'm so bad at that.  I'm almost like I wanted to hear an answer that I hadn't like, or I wanted to hear something that went against what I told myself.  But my batting average with knowing when women like me and when they don't is fucking chilling how good it is. 
[03:24:00]  It's amazing.  People are like, you're so negative, but I'm not.  It could be so chilling because you predetermine it before it actually plays out.  That's why it's chilling.  Oh, my record is great.  This chick doesn't like me.  You know why?  Because you had it set in your head, and that's how it turned out.  Nah, because I think a good record is almost more telling that it's your fault.  No, I just, I know when they want to be friends.  Like, I can just tell when they want to be friends. 
[03:24:30]  And I made a mistake a few times, but I just knew.  It was like, ah, this is too good to be true.  There's no way she's like enjoying the beach with me.  She joked about it being romantic, too.  Yeah, but I joked about it being romantic.  And I know.  I thought the same thing.  I'm not.  Why did she say?  Unless she said something like, this would be romantic if I was with somebody except you.  Nah, it was just kind of just kidding about the situation.  I just believe, I fucking.  Were you sitting on a blanket?  No, we didn't plan that.  Who am I, Ricky Martin and his friends?  No, we just. 
[03:25:00]  It was a spur of the moment thing.  I'm sitting there in fucking my black jeans with my Doc Martens on the beach.  But we were unprepared.  We were just going and hanging out.  We went out to dinner.  But it's body language.  And the body language was getting better.  Like, she was leaning in more and talking to me more.  Like, you know, like little things that the arm touch.  But she used to dance.  Wow.  You really add everything up.  You did really misread it?  No.  You add everything up.  I kind of knew all along.  But you were hoping.  I guess so.  I was kind of hoping that, like, my instincts were wrong.  But they're never wrong with this shit.  Before we end the show, Mike from Tennessee. 
[03:25:30]  I'm going to forget this.  So I want to go to this call real fast.  Mike A.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, good idea for the Super Bowl.  Yeah.  It goes back to NEW.  It's the Aztec Challenge.  Jar, couple of bees, couple of balls.  Yes.  The bees.  For the Super Bowl on Thursday.  You're going to get bees.  Let's get.  We'll get a beekeeper.  We'll get a beekeeper January.  We just need two lousy bees and two mayonnaise jars.  We got the mayonnaise jars, obviously.  We just need the bees. 
[03:26:00]  And whoever gets stung first.  Well, that'll be part of the challenge, yes.  I like it.  We're bringing back the old bit.  The old bee in the jar bit.  I like it.  The bee in the jar.  And they got to sting just the scrotum.  Like, you have to find a way to get your scrotum skin hanging in there.  Like the fucking, like a lip flopping over.  Don.  The skin.  Don's listening to Washington.  Take that to the lawyers.  We don't care how much paperwork they have to sign.  These guys will take a bee sting to the junk.  That's right.  This Thursday during Super Bowl.  All right, thank you, Mike. 
[03:26:30]  All right, you're welcome.  Take care, guys.  All right, it's Rick in Minnesota.  Rick?  Yeah, you guys can do a betting thing where you can bet how many times they can take a  mousetrap to the sack.  Thanks for nothing.  Yeah.  You are useless, my friend.  That's useless.  Let's go to Bill in Jersey.  Bill?  Yo, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Uh, real quick.  You ever heard of fire ants? 
[03:27:00]  Yes, fire ants hurt when they bite you.  I'm taking a couple of bucks.  All right.  Can somebody please go down to Brazil and pick us up some?  We need fire ants and bees for Thursday's Super Bowl.  Well, how about roaches?  You have to put your thing, you have to put your balls in a thing and let roaches crawl  on them.  I don't know if that would skeeve somebody, but that would skeeve me a lot.  Yeah, it certainly would.  Ants.  Just regular ants.  You don't need fire ants.  Jimmy would fall in love with the roach.  I really would.  It would dump him.  I would think it was romantic that the roach was, maybe we could go to the beach.  Or something.  My fat neck. 
[03:27:30]  Hey, let's thank 2020 for stopping by to film a little Jimmy Norton today.  Thanks, guys.  Good luck using any of this shit.  I think.  During the piece.  Thank you.  I want footage of the boys.  20 fucking 20.  See you tomorrow.  All right.  Bye.  This concludes our podcast day.  It will be an Anthony show.  Grr. </pre>
