<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often veering wildly off-tangent.  The show opened with discussions about their forced niceness on air, their studio PalTalk cameras, and a continuing feud with a CBS camera crew, culminating in the discovery of a hat used to cover the camera being cut up.  Anthony's winter coat woes were also briefly discussed.  The hosts promoted their "80s New Wave Tuesday" segment, receiving a celebrity endorsement from Nick Rhodes of Duran Duran. A listener called in with 9/11 conspiracy theories, which were dismissed.  They also hyped their "Makeup Stuff Tuesday" segment (designed to spread misinformation) and the upcoming Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, particularly focusing on a planned (fictional) Hitler balloon promoting the movie *Valkyrie*.  A significant portion revolved around their neighbor, "Charlie from Across the Way," and his planned sexual encounter, along with a lengthy discussion about a previous segment featuring "Stalker Patty" and her THC-laced breath strip experience.  The segment concluded with a discussion of E-Rock's lateness, blamed on a neighbor's domestic disturbance and his Klonopin use.

The show continued with a discussion sparked by a Polish organization’s request to meet with Rupert Murdoch, leading to a conversation about racial and ethnic humor, referencing *All in the Family*. This segued into a lengthy discussion of the aforementioned Hitler balloon for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, featuring listener calls with varying reactions.  Tangents included proposed solutions to parade traffic, critiques of news anchors' parade commentary, and humorous speculation about the balloon's movements. The death of Dick Wilson (Mr. Whipple) was discussed in detail, using vulgar language.  Other news items covered included a lottery winner hiding his winnings, a bar owner assaulting a customer, Michael Vick's surrender, A-Rod winning an MVP award, and rising hate crime statistics.  The hosts promoted Bill Burr's show and their upcoming "Dumb-Off" with Rich Voss, before returning to the Hitler balloon controversy and its media coverage.

The broadcast then featured another humorous description of the Hitler balloon, followed by a discussion about the Broadway actors' strike impacting *How the Grinch Stole Christmas*.  A musical interlude of "ho-ho-ho-y" was played, followed by a *South Park* clip and listener calls.  One caller, Ed from Detroit, detailed his divorce and his wife's affair, prompting a discussion about infidelity detection.  Another caller, Craig, corroborated the affair. The hosts then criticized Steve Martin's new Pink Panther movie and mocked his "King Tut" song, including a sarcastic analysis of the lyrics.  A PalTalk user, "Oddball," discussed her online behavior, including exposing herself, with her fiancé's apparent knowledge. Audio clips of Steve Carleesi, including listener remixes, were played, along with listener-submitted audio, such as a rap song about Carleesi and a continuation of the Ramon storyline. Listener calls included a birthday discussion and movie recommendations (*A Clockwork Orange* among them).  The show ended with Sonny discussing his reconciliation with his wife and a heated argument about a damaged car.

A helicopter segment featured a call with Mike from Liberty Helicopters, addressing Jimmy’s anxieties about helicopter safety and flight conditions. Mike discussed the company's services, its connection to the TSA, and offered Jimmy a private tour and a possible helicopter ride to a Jim Norton show. This was followed by a vulgar discussion of the hosts' bodily functions. The latter part focused on the fallout from a disagreement between Danny and Master Poe, including discussions of studio surveillance and retaliatory pranks.  The show then aired clips from Master Poe’s radio show, which featured martial arts guests, frequent use of the word "ush," and anecdotes including a violent and sexually suggestive story from a convict.  The hosts also discussed various callers to Master Poe's show. Master Poe explained his use of "ush" as a term of respect in martial arts.

The final segment began with a discussion of road rage, followed by an improvised skit about passive-aggressive responses.  A contentious exchange with a disgruntled Paul ensued, involving accusations of Paul writing letters to get a host in trouble, framed within a martial arts code of conduct. This led to numerous offensive and sexually explicit comments about lesbians, Ellen DeGeneres, and other topics.  The show ended with a pre-recorded, profane phone call about a botched roofing job involving a character named Scooter, including the use of multiple racial slurs and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks.  Opie and Anthony.  The world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their offense.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why?  Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good. 
[00:00:30]  Go screw!  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony.  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony's striking again.  I sat with some of the greatest gangsters in the f***ing world.  John Gotti, Zim Gravano.  And I went in there and said, John, you ever f*** with me again, this is over. 
[00:01:00]  You hear it? Now sit down.  Opie and Anthony.  I was amazed. Guns N' Roses was starting to blow up.  And you didn't have guitars to play because you were pointing them off to get some dope.  Yeah, I was a big fan of the age.  Big fan.  Opie and Anthony.  This country went off the cliff and it's just in free fall news.  It's just a sick, sick, it's disgusting my voice you hear.  It's time for people to understand these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Aye.  What's wrong with my microphone today?  Is something wrong?  Yeah, can you hear it?  It sounds a little different.  Oh, you got your hands wrapped around it.  Oh.  Call number 877-212-ON-A.  Also a fine website you should, like, I don't know, put in your favorites. 
[00:02:00]  It's O-N-A-Radio.com.  Steven Escher and Basher does the show rundowns.  He also adds all the links of all the crazy videos and audio clips that we talk about on a daily basis.  Book market.  Book market.  It's one website you can go to check out everything we talk about on the radio show.  Does that make sense out there, I hope?  Yeah, absolutely.  Like the Jimmy Dean complaint call getting a lot of play.  Oh, sausage.  Sausage.  Sausage.  On O-N-A-Radio.com.  You also got the PalTalk cameras all over the studio. 
[00:02:30]  Hi.  So you can see what we look like first thing in the morning as we do a radio show.  A little wave.  There we go.  Hey, how you doing?  Anthony looks like he's ready to climb Mount Everest today.  Well, I screwed up yesterday, the walkover yesterday.  Wow.  Misty, rainy, freezing coldy.  And I shan't fall for that again.  I realize, where do you get a winter coat?  It's very hard to get them. 
[00:03:00]  I think all the summer stuff is out now.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that's how the stores work.  If you didn't get it early, you're too late.  So now you can get bathing suits now.  Well, my winter coat was a little ratty.  Yeah.  So, I don't know, around May, I just threw it away.  I'm like, I don't need a winter coat anytime soon.  Yeah.  Now I need a winter coat.  And I'm like, crap.  See?  Now what are you going to do?  I got to find one.  I don't even know where to go for a winter coat.  Winter coats, to me, are purely utilitarian. 
[00:03:30]  I don't care what they look like.  I don't care if people make fun of me, which they do, Opie.  They do make fun of me and my winter coat.  Yeah.  Because it is a heavy parka with a hood that looks ridiculous when I put it up.  But I am warm in it, and that's all I care about.  Now spring and fall, things like that, then you can start getting your cool leather wear out. 
[00:04:00]  But in the winter, I don't care.  You know, I bought a coat last year from Abercrombie and Fitch.  Oh, my.  Why?  What's wrong with that?  I can't even walk in that place.  Bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, bap, boof, boof, boof, boof, boof, boof, boof.  Would you like something?  Yeah.  Zip.  Help a brother out.  I like some of their clothes.  I don't like the clothes with the logo on it.  I like very simple.  I'm not a logo guy. 
[00:04:30]  But every once in a while I'll grab a pair of jeans or a shirt or something in there.  And last year I bought a winter coat that has to weigh, I don't even want to exaggerate here.  I'm not even going to exaggerate.  When I put it on, I think it adds 50 pounds.  That's good.  50 pounds to carry around?  That's 50 pounds of warm goodness.  And at the time, you know, it looked good on the rack.  I'm like, yeah, I'll just buy that.  That looks cool.  But I didn't really inspect it.  And the hood, because it's funny you just mentioned your hood. 
[00:05:00]  This hood has to be, what am I doing?  Trying to hug a fat person.  Yes, making something the size of a manhole cover.  Right, okay.  That's how big my hood is.  No joke.  I try to put it on and it's like this.  Now what am I doing?  Ballet dancing.  Yes, you're doing a pirouette.  With plenty of room, right?  That's what my hood looks like in this coat.  Don't you have a pull string to pull it tight towards your face like Kenny?  Sort of, but then it gets all poofy. 
[00:05:30]  See, yeah, watch.  I'll put mine up.  I'll put mine up.  And see, here's where people make fun of.  Yeah, that looks stupid.  Look how giant it is.  That looks stupid.  It's as if I was a conehead.  Yeah.  With...  It doesn't look that bad.  No, it looks ridiculous.  That's right.  But it's very warm.  A nice hazmat suit you're wearing.  Right.  When I pull the cords, though, I look like I have like Rastafarian hair underneath the thing.  Oh, yeah.  Because it's just so much.  So much hood.  Rastafarian cap, yeah. 
[00:06:00]  All right.  So we got the Pal Talk cameras.  And I guess we got to officially say hi to this CBS camera that they have up watching us like Big Brother.  Wait, is that on?  It has to be.  There's been a thing going on.  We have our own Pal Talk cameras.  We started this Pal Talk phenomenon about a year ago.  Yeah, let me tell you something.  This was an O&A exclusive.  Really, there was nobody doing this on the radio.  I mean, we didn't invent Pal Talk. 
[00:06:30]  But I think incorporated into the radio show.  It's become very popular.  A great way to show what's going on in the studio.  And a great way to see the listeners do stupid stuff.  But now they decided to just do it the entire day here in New York.  But they popped up this camera that we don't control.  Now, the one thing is we like having control of the cameras.  I'll tell you why.  I'll throw myself under the bus.  I have a problem with picking my nose in the morning. 
[00:07:00]  And so I finally told Ant, Ant, you got to give me a faraway shot or the back of my head.  Because I'm always digging.  Digging.  I thought you would have the cameras zoomed.  What's the matter with you?  I would love people.  I'm always digging in the morning.  These guys think I didn't think they knew.  Of course I know.  I got an itchy, dry nose.  I'm always going like this.  Got to moisten it up.  Something has to happen.  Because I blow my nose like no one's business every morning just to get ready for the freaking radio show. 
[00:07:30]  So, you know, we adjust the cameras accordingly.  Yeah.  And the sleepy eyes and all this crap.  No one wants to be seen that way.  No.  So they have control of a camera.  And the dude's in Brooklyn, I guess.  He's not even anywhere near us.  Yeah, he's not here.  So we've been covering up the camera with a hat every morning.  Yeah.  And then they take the hat and cover up our Paltalk camera after we leave.  It's been going back and forth for maybe a month.  Well, today we found the hat that we cover up their camera. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  All cut up.  Chopped up into little pieces.  Like how violent is that?  That's like, you know, all right, send them a message.  I want that hat hacked to pieces.  Right.  And that's what they did.  They cut it up and left it for us to find.  So now an easy little post-it note over the camera just pretty much ends.  Where can we see the CBS camera, though?  I don't know.  Yeah, that's just it, too.  I think you go.  You got to go to the website. 
[00:08:30]  I don't know.  Don't worry about it now.  Yeah, I don't know.  We'll figure it out during the break.  Yeah, well, I see a plug that's unplugged, so I don't think it matters at this point.  Well, no.  The power cord is out.  We're still fighting the good fight with that camera.  There's a post-it over the lens, and we have unplugged it.  There you go.  There you go.  Oh, speaking.  You know what I think?  Uh-huh.  I think we plug it in and let them turn it on, because I think it goes to the station website  is where you access it from. 
[00:09:00]  Okay.  And then just prop up a picture of hardcore pornography, something that is frowned upon.  Why do that when we have a little Jimmy Norton?  Oh, well, yes.  Jimmy, can you give him a nice little shot?  Can you give him the old smile?  Can you give him the old brown eye?  Give him the old brown eye, girl?  Take that banana and put it to use.  I want to just get on a ladder, and all of a sudden, I'm like, helmet.  Oh, wait.  Hey, real fast, going back for a second, talking about coats.  At least I got some kind of outerwear when you're walking around at night. 
[00:09:30]  I went to the Islander Ranger game last night here in New York City.  Congratulations on your Islanders.  Thank you, sir.  Like you're on the team.  Well, I sort of am at this point.  I'm actually now traveling with the team.  I went and saw them in Jersey, and now I saw them here in Manhattan.  Yeah, they beat the Rangers last night 2-1.  Couldn't be happier.  And Bruins, we're coming after you this coming Saturday.  So trust me, I study the schedule.  But we have to get past the Canadians tomorrow night. 
[00:10:00]  But we will.  And then we're going to kick the Bruins' ass.  Wow.  Go Islanders.  Drive for five.  Yeah, drive for five 25 years later.  20-some-odd years later.  Great.  But anyway, Tom Chiasano was nice enough to give me tickets to the game last night.  Fine seats, by the way.  Were they?  Great seats.  Got to see the Islanders shoot twice.  Because that's what's funny about getting tickets for your home team. 
[00:10:30]  When someone has tickets, they're usually at the wrong end of the ice,  and you only get to see your team shoot once.  Yeah.  Right?  But if you give it to a fan of the opposing team, now they're like great seats.  And that's what happened to me last night.  Great seats.  And I go with Roland.  Everyone knows Roland.  And I meet him on the corner to grab the subway down to Madison Square Garden last night.  And the guy shows up in a Ranger t-shirt.  He's a Ranger fan.  Whatever.  No big deal.  But that's what he showed up with. 
[00:11:00]  A Ranger t-shirt on.  I'm like, Roland, it's the 30-something degrees out.  We're not in the middle of winter, but it's still too cold for just wearing a t-shirt.  We were talking about that yesterday.  When I was walking to the garage, he's walking, and he had a t-shirt on.  He had the Christopher Walken t-shirt on.  Right.  And that was it, just a t-shirt.  And he's like, no, I'm not cold.  I'm never cold.  It was, yesterday was this misting, rainy, cold day. 
[00:11:30]  It was one of those days where it's cold to the bone.  And the wind, yeah, a little windy.  And he's just in a t-shirt, sweating.  The guy sweats in any conditions.  He's just like a ham.  Roland reminds me of a cured ham.  He's going to put cloves up his nostrils.  So we've got to talk to him about that.  By the way, J.D. Collins writing in from Maine.  You studied the schedule, huh?  Oh, the Islanders play the Bruins Friday afternoon.  Oops.  You know, you could study and get things wrong, sir. 
[00:12:00]  Hey, man.  When you studied in school, did you get an A on everything, J.D. Collins?  So maybe, all right, I got one wrong.  Are you kidding me?  I was looking at this.  I made plans to go Saturday.  Now it's not studying.  You were just looking.  I made plans to go.  I perused it.  What an idiot.  You're an idiot, J.D. Collins.  Oh.  Oh.  Idiot.  Face.  What, you got him?  Yes.  Well, we're both right.  Oh, how did that happen? 
[00:12:30]  I forgot that it's kind of cool, actually.  The Islanders are going up and playing Boston, in Boston, Friday at noon.  Oh, okay.  And then they come back down and play at the Coliseum out on Long Island on Saturday.  That's the closest thing to a hockey doubleheader.  Yeah, it's a home and home series, I guess you would call it.  So we're both right, J.D. Collins.  I do study the schedule, and I get an A+.  Plus, I'm going to give myself a couple extra credit points today.  Wow.  And a gold star. 
[00:13:00]  Wow.  Sorry, I'm losing my mind.  We also have instant feedback.  I wanted to mention that as well.  Let's get this out of the way.  It's Walter from West Palm Beach, Florida.  Walter.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  Hey.  Why are you guys, like, can't you guys get back down here?  No, they decided to go with a local morning show.  Yeah.  How's that working out?  And the PD trashed us in the press, which was wonderful.  Where's this?  Huh?  Where?  West Palm Beach, Florida. 
[00:13:30]  Did he trash this in the press?  Did he?  He said it was just not working.  Just not working.  There you go.  But it was working.  Whatever.  Well, what do you got, Walter?  I'm going to do a rock scream.  All right.  It is Rock Scream Tuesday.  Let's go.  That'll be good.  Jesus. 
[00:14:00]  That was like Newt Scream in Aliens.  All right.  We'll accept that, Walter.  Thank you, sir.  Let's go to Paul in New York.  Paul, what's up?  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  How do you guys know that's a CBS camera, not that creep that was staring at you guys from  the window last yesterday?  You guys, yeah, that kind of sounded creepy yesterday, didn't it?  A little creepy.  I could hear the fear in your guys' voice.  You guys weren't being nice.  You were afraid for your lives. 
[00:14:30]  I thought about that after the show, and it was a bit creepy.  We have a guy.  Most people know by now that we look out this huge window right in the middle of Midtown,  Manhattan, pretty much.  And we see this girl wandering around her apartment every morning, completely naked.  She has all the shades up.  Naked.  And the drapes pulled aside.  It's clear as day.  Bright lights.  She gets on an exercise bike.  Sometimes she does headstands, but she walks around very naked almost every morning.  Hasn't gained a pound, hasn't lost a pound in over a year since we've been watching her 
[00:15:00]  every day.  And yesterday, we had a guy call us saying he's watching us.  Yeah.  We don't want to be watched.  We want to be the...  Don't look at us.  We want to be the watchers.  Is he watching us now?  And sure enough, we thought he was just lying, and then we looked around at this building,  and finally we saw this guy at the window with a phone as he's talking to us.  Here's the odd thing.  I thought these windows were like that you can't see in windows.  Yeah, they're double pane. 
[00:15:30]  I thought the whole outside of the building was like mirrored, so you can't really see  in.  But now I realize every time we would just...  Ten of us run to the window to go see Naked Girl, all she had to do was turn around and  look and see a whole lineup of people.  Trust me, she did.  You think so?  Yeah, she saw us looking at her, and that's her thing.  She likes that.  She has to like that.  She's not going to make it obvious that she's looking at us.  No, true.  She's probably taking a little peek to the side or whatever, maybe a reflection through 
[00:16:00]  a mirror or something, but she knows we're looking now.  I'm also thinking like this, when it's dark out and the lights are on in here, you could  absolutely see in here.  Sure.  Like very well.  Sure.  Now I'm really creeped out.  All right.  That woman didn't do anything to act like she did know people were watching.  It wasn't like she lost weight or tried to look good.  But she's just frumpy.  She was just a frumpy girl who was unkempt and out of shape and walked around naked,  daring people to look.  I think our new friend, his name is Charlie. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  And Charlie said that he bangs a lot of broads and he's going to do something nice for us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's going to put on a little show or something.  We'll see if that was just BS or not.  Yeah.  All right.  It's also 80s New Wave Tuesday.  Tim put this together.  We got a little celebrity endorsing 80s New Wave Tuesday.  We don't even know what it is.  It's just some goof that we started.  But now we got celebrities endorsing 80s New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wait, before you even play it, I've noticed that 80s New Wave Tuesday is nothing more 
[00:17:00]  than promoing 80s New Wave Tuesday.  There isn't really an 80s New Wave Tuesday segment.  That's the beauty of it.  It's just promoted.  It makes the show sound like it's all encompassing and there's so much going on.  That's ridiculous.  No, it's not.  If that's the only part of the show you hear, you're like, wow, those guys are really busy  every morning.  They got 80s New Wave Tuesday.  They got rock screams out the gang.  They got makeup stuff Tuesday, faraway phone calls coming in left and right. 
[00:17:30]  At least occasionally someone does call with a rock scream.  It was horrible, but they do.  80s New Wave Tuesday, there's no use for it.  We don't play 80s songs.  We don't do an 80s New Wave Tuesday trivia thing.  We just promote the fact that it's 80s New Wave Tuesday with a few 80s songs.  Do you want to work more?  No, no.  Don't get me wrong.  Then ixnay on the 80s New Wave A.  This is the brilliance of us.  Actually, I know what we could do.  We could force the listeners to start doing all the work for us. 
[00:18:00]  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  Have them call up with their 80s New Wave song.  We try to figure out who sings it.  Wow.  And now we don't even have to pick out the 80s New Wave song.  Yeah, because for a while, that's what was happening.  Like a song would be played, and we'd go, oh, who was that?  So you do the work for us.  Find your 80s New Wave records and play them for us.  No obscure crap, and we'll tell you who sings them.  Yeah.  All right?  There you go.  Problem solved.  That sounds reasonable.  Okay, now at least it's a segment.  With that, we have a celebrity endorsing 80s New Wave Tuesday. 
[00:18:30]  Hey, this is Nick Rhodes from Duran Duran and this.  Oh, yeah, barely a celebrity, I should have said.  Oh, oh.  Couldn't get the big guy.  Duran, Duran.  Yeah.  What about Simon Lebon?  We should have got Simon Lebon.  Simon Lebon.  And actually, when Tim played this for me yesterday, I'm like, wow, Simon Lebon.  Simon Lebon.  I just realized right now that it's not.  It's not Simon Lebon.  He's been in the band since the beginning.  I couldn't tell you.  What did Nick do in the band?  Keyboards. 
[00:19:00]  How did Tim get them?  I don't know.  Pretty important because you're the keyboard player.  They're a big rock station.  They got some big rockers walking around.  We get the keyboards from Duran Duran.  Duran Duran.  If he is.  Hey, this is Nick Rhodes from Duran Duran and this is 80s New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and  Anthony show.  Girls on Film.  Girls on Film.  Girls on Film. 
[00:19:30]  Girls on Film.  A real woman could stop you from drinking.  Yeah, it would be a real big woman.  Don't stop to ask.  You found a way to make it last.  You've got to find a way.  Say what you want to say.  Break out.  Why can't you give me the respect that I'm entitled to? 
[00:20:00]  When there is always something there to remind me.  Always something there to remind me.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, one of the greatest movies ever to goof on.  No wire hangers ever.  Tina, clean this up.  Wow. 
[00:20:30]  That was good.  Good singing.  Good songs.  You like it?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  80s New Wave Tuesday is happening.  We're still trying to develop this, but we'll make you guys call up with your 80s songs  for us.  Hey, Steven S. from Bayshore might have the actual spelling of sausages, because we've  been trying to figure that out.  Fat Girl takes a peep back at you guys, talking about the girl across the way, between rounds  of Jimmy Dean sausages, and he spells it S-O-S-I-T-C-H-E-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S-S- 
[00:21:00]  Some guy with his conspiracy theories.  It's fun time.  What is he talking about?  Do you know a military simulation of hijacked planes took place on the morning of 9-11? 
[00:21:30]  Did it.  Bye.  No, it didn't.  Did it?  Let me get your name.  Banned.  And who runs a simulation the day they do something and then lets some guy on PalTalk find out about it?  Who are you, stupid?  Douche.  Now with children.  And they told the government to stand down.  Did they?  Did they.  Really, JFK lingo ripper offer? 
[00:22:00]  Shut your mouth.  You and Donald Sutherland talked that over in a park, did you?  Be quiet.  They're telling you, the government, they told them to stand down.  Stand down, sir.  And then they hit all the people.  Really?  They hit the people, did they?  That was what they did.  How does that work?  Where are they now?  Just eating, going, when are we leaving?  This is the longest flight delay I've ever had.  They wanted to get into the war desperately, so they set up 9-11, and yet they couldn't make Colin Powell not look retarded in the U.N. 
[00:22:30]  with that stupid African uranium thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They tripped up on that?  Oh, yeah, that little trailer.  We were wrong.  Oops.  Hope that was done.  The little truck, the little bread truck full of biohazard material.  Almighty.  That looks stupid.  Don't you think we would have had a better cover story for the war than that stupid truck?  That truck stunk.  It was awful.  He even looked like, oh, my God, no one's going to buy this.  It was terrible.  It was like a good humor truck.  Good humor truck that just gave out anthrax. 
[00:23:00]  Poor Colin.  It ruined him.  Yeah, it sure did.  Hey, we do have to take a break.  We're a little late here, but we've got to set up Makeup Stuff Tuesday because a lot of the bloggers are on to us,  so we really, really, really need the help of the pest today.  Oh, yeah.  Because now we're fighting spoilers.  Spoilers.  Well, I was going to say spoilers.  Spoil sports.  Yeah, thank you.  Spoiled sport.  Spoiled sport.  There are bloggers out there that are trying to wreck our Makeup Stuff Tuesday every Tuesday, 
[00:23:30]  so we really need the help of the pest to spread this quickly and efficiently.  Bloggers are great.  I'm sorry.  I love bloggers.  People you don't want to listen to, now you can go read them.  Well, you're too boring to talk to.  I think I'll read all your thoughts.  There's one guy that's blowing up our spot every week, and he's saying that he's a fan of the show.  How could you possibly be a fan of this radio show and blow up our spot at the same time?  Just leave it alone.  Leave us alone. 
[00:24:00]  You're not a fan of the show whatsoever, and the pests know who you are, and they will be having fun with your blog.  Yeah.  Makeup Stuff Tuesday.  Well, we've got Thanksgiving right around the corner.  We've got the Macy's Day Parade happening here in New York City, right?  Every year they have a bunch of new floats.  Balloons.  The new balloons.  That's the big thing.  That's the big thing with the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is the balloons.  You know those things that hit light posts or things and kill families from the Midwest? 
[00:24:30]  Well, one family.  And then injured another one.  There's always a problem with the wind.  See, they don't understand.  The wind blows the balloons around and knocks over some lampposts.  So, eh, good luck to you this year.  Who's the family that's in a hotel, like, right now, all excited that they're here for Thanksgiving Day Parade?  Who are they, the ones that are going to be clobbered and end up in a hospital?  Oh, it's going to be fine.  Yeah?  Yeah, it'll be fine.  All right.  I hope so. 
[00:25:00]  One year they decided to, like, fly the balloons a foot from the street.  Yeah.  Because the year before there was a tragedy.  Yeah, it was like they were dragging the balloons down the street.  But last year, oh, boy, they were as high as they could be.  They forget easily.  A year goes by, you know, it's back to normal for everybody.  But we're going to list the balloons in this year's Macy's Day Parade, all the new balloons.  And there's going to be one in there that's going to outrage the hell out of a lot of people.  Yes.  The Hitler balloon.  Hitler balloon. 
[00:25:30]  Hitler balloon.  Now, this is to promote.  Start Googling.  Number one on Google Trends today, baby.  Hitler balloon.  This is going to be to promote the movie Valkyrie.  Okay.  Yeah, because most people are rolling their eyes like, how are you going to pull this one out?  But it's promoting the Tom Cruise movie.  Tom Cruise movie.  Because the balloons every year, they promote stuff because it's a marketing thing now, too.  So we're going to have three or four new balloons.  Hitler balloon is going to be in there.  And there's already outrage, right? 
[00:26:00]  And, yes, there's already outrage.  We've got to figure out a way how we're going to squeeze this in, though.  Like, it's got to sound really good.  That's why we need the listeners to help out.  Yeah.  You guys need to call up and go, how do you feel about this Hitler balloon thing?  We really need your help with this one because this might be tough.  We need an organization that is fake, obviously, but sounds legitimate.  That is at the forefront of this outrage.  The spokesperson for Job, Jews Against Hitler Balloons. 
[00:26:30]  JAHP.  Well, we're writing the AP story as we speak.  This is how Makeup Stuff Tuesday works, though.  Mm-hmm.  We're going to take a break within seconds.  Yeah.  And now we don't mention this at all.  Now we don't mention it, that it's absolutely not happening.  But the people that are listening now, you're in on the joke.  You're in on the joke.  And at 7 o'clock, we're going to hit everybody with the Hitler balloon.  And you'll be in on it. 
[00:27:00]  And that's when you should start calling and going, hey, guys, what do you think of this Hitler balloon?  This is crazy, isn't it?  All right?  Insanity.  Please be believable.  If you suck at acting, then let someone else do this.  Yes, don't even try.  All right?  We got Charlie from Across the Way.  He's on hold.  Charlie from Across the Way.  We'll talk to Charlie again today.  And we're going to find out where E-Rock is.  Is E-Rock here yet?  What happened to you?  Look at E-Rock.  Oh, my God. 
[00:27:30]  What happened?  You're not even at your post.  Are you okay?  You look all like...  We'll find out what's wrong with E-Rock today.  Let me see.  Let me take a look at you.  All right.  Why are you looking all confused?  You look retarded.  A little.  You know, we'll talk...  All right, we'll talk to him now.  We'll talk to E-Rock next.  Every morning, there's some kind of problem with one guy.  Some drama.  I'm starting to think it might be you, sir.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap. 
[00:28:00]  Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.  Ew.  Why couldn't I sing a song with you guys the other night?  Oh.  Dirty deeds and they're done dirt cheap.  Could have done that one.  Or I could have sang harmonies on the Alice in Chains stuff.  Yep.  Eee.  No.  I didn't even, like, know you were still there after a while, though.  Oh, yeah.  You were kind of hanging in the back by the bar area? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, just hanging in the corner by myself being antisocial.  We got a...  I think we're going to do something else in December over at Bar 9.  Okay.  Like something like that.  Cool.  Yeah.  Just having some fun with the guys.  Reserve me a corner so I can be antisocial.  All right.  But it's just...  Eh, whatever.  It's Opie and Anthony.  There's just always one guy that wrecks it.  Only one?  For the most part.  Most of the fans are awesome. 
[00:29:00]  I like talking to them.  But then there's always one guy that just bores you to death with the same stupid questions.  You got to just smile and nod.  Talk hockey or something.  Or music.  Or else you're the ass.  Yeah.  877-212-ON-A.  We're trying to take more phone calls on the Opie and Anthony show.  So, what do you got, Jimmy?  I'm just wondering what I'm doing December 3rd.  Because your Imus returns at Town Hall.  Yeah.  Town Hall returns.  Yeah, we'll be there, by the way. 
[00:29:30]  Right after this show, we're going to head right down there and welcome Imus back to radio.  Absolutely.  Unless they won't let us in, but we're heading there.  All right.  Hey, we got Charlie from across the way.  Let's see what he's doing today.  Charlie, you creep.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you guys doing?  Hey, man.  What's up, Charlie?  So, yeah.  I woke up at 5 this morning to hear you guys and to see you guys walking around.  There's some commotion up there at the window during the commercial break. 
[00:30:00]  It was weird.  That commotion would be Tom Chiasano protecting us and making sure you're not a creep.  Yeah, Tom came in.  Because we just talked about you on the radio, so Tom came running in to kind of check out  the situation.  Oh, all right.  I can understand the security issue, but I'm just a neighbor, I promise.  Yeah.  Well, that was the commotion you saw.  Everyone kind of like peeking through the windows trying to see where you were today.  Oh, I could have turned on a light if you wanted. 
[00:30:30]  You know, you kept me on hold long enough.  Get out of the way.  It sounds creepy.  I know.  You kept me on hold long enough.  Get out.  The phone call's coming from the other room.  You're creeping us out, Charlie.  Hey, guys.  I don't mean to creep you out, but you know, it's 6.30 in the morning.  What else can I do?  Well, you said you're going to bring a broad home.  When is that happening?  Okay.  Well, I spoke to the Israeli chick, and it's a go, but she goes to NYU Tisch, and she's 
[00:31:00]  an acting major.  Okay.  So she has kind of a busy schedule, but when it does happen, I will let you know a day  in advance.  And Charlie, we'll turn the lights off here, and you can leave your lights on, and we'll  turn the lights off here.  Just let us know when it happens, and this way she won't look up and see five stupid  faces pressed against the window, staring at her.  Yeah.  All you have to do is...  Look, I've got to tell you, having her come over so I can have my way with her is one  thing.  That's easy. 
[00:31:30]  But convincing her to wake up early and pound her against the window with the cell phone  in her face with her moaning on the radio is difficult.  You take skills.  Tell her this, though.  It's not waking up early.  It's staying up late.  Yes.  Get her drunk.  Right.  While she's vomiting, tell her, here, come up out this window.  Right.  All right, Charlie.  I'm glad you're just a neighbor, hopefully.  We'll be walking by one morning.  We're going to see a red thing shining on us with a little light. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, the laser.  Hooked up on a scope.  The laser sight.  All right, Charlie.  I used to listen to you guys a lot back in the day before you went to XM and got kicked  off the radio.  But, you know, the reason I listened to you two days ago was because Joe Rogan was on  and he's actually a client of mine.  I work for a marketing firm.  So you can thank him for, you know, sort of unveiling the creature.  Rogan's involved with everything.  He's brought some weird stuff to the show.  Yeah.  It's like a lot of drug knowledge, baby bird. 
[00:32:30]  It was his suggestion.  Yeah.  And Charlie.  Yeah, Rogan's great, man.  And let's not forget what happened to Patty on Friday.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  That was a good one.  All right, Charlie, we've got to let you go.  Oh, I don't get to sing a song for you?  What do you want to sing?  What do you want to sing, creep?  Charlie the Creep.  That's your name.  What's up?  What do you got?  Charlie the Creep.  You know, it's funny.  I was at work and I was thinking that was going to become my name.  But, yeah, so do I try to tell you what song I'm singing?  No, if it's 80s New Wave, you want to do that and we have to guess? 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Ready?  Yeah.  Okay.  I would go out tonight.  But I haven't got a stitch to wear.  Swanee River?  Man said it's gruesome that someone so handsome should care.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Dismissed this charming man.  You're supposed to...  Oh, man.  You don't know how to, like, tease radio bits. 
[00:33:30]  Steve from Page West insisting, we'll never, ever see this guy having sex with a girl.  No, you have to understand that getting a girl in the bed, I promise you, you don't play heavy metal, which I have here.  No, no, no.  You play the Smiths.  Hey, Charlie, all right.  Listen, we've got to do a radio show.  This is fun of the...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's great.  Oh, right, right.  You've got to focus a little bit if you want to be a part of our show.  I'll take some Ritalin before I call your show next. 
[00:34:00]  All right.  Thank you, Charlie.  Hey, Charlie, from across the way.  We just wanted a quick phone call from Charlie from across the way.  But then he set up the Joe Rogan thing, and then it gets us talking about Stalker Patty from Friday.  A lot of people still figuring it out.  Did we get Stalker Patty Stone?  She certainly had something going on, that's for sure.  Did we get Stalker Patty Stone?  Out of it.  A funny thread on a whack bag the day it happened, it just said, Stalker Patty, worst pothead ever.  Worst pothead ever. 
[00:34:30]  Joe Rogan was in.  He had some of these, what are those strips called again?  It's like a Listerine breath strip, but it wasn't Listerine.  It wasn't a breath strip.  It was THC.  Right.  He puts it in his mouth, it dissolves, and he's beyond the point of needing to smoke pot like normal people do.  Yeah.  The guy has it in lollipops and strips, breath strips.  Amazing.  So we brought Stalker Patty in later on in the show, and we basically said, hey, Patty, your breath sucks. 
[00:35:00]  Everyone says how bad your breath is.  It could be all the coffee you drink at work.  And we gave her a breath strip.  Did we pull the old switcheroo?  The old switcheroo.  Did we give her one of the strips that Joe Rogan was carrying around?  Mm-hmm.  Well, it was very convincing.  Stalker Patty was feeling the effects of marijuana.  Yeah.  Well, was it a plebo?  What is it called?  A placebo.  A placebo thing?  Or was it the real deal?  Well, someone took the audio and put it to White Rabbit. 
[00:35:30]  Here it is.  Hey, let's get Stalker Patty in here real fast.  Yes.  People are saying that you have really bad breath.  Patty, have you ever tried the breath strips?  There you go.  That's fine.  Well, I'll just give her a whole one.  Give her a second.  Did you just...  No.  Hold on.  Hey, let her swallow it.  You just ate pot.  I know I did.  You ate pot in its purest form.  In its purest form.  Which is not even the pot.  It's the drug that makes pot a drug.  I've never been high before.  What are you going to be?  You are going to be real high.  You are going to take a little trip, Patty.  You're not going to take a little trip?  What do you mean, a little trip?  It'll be a good trip. 
[00:36:00]  To be honest with us, Patty, what are you feeling right now?  I'm scared.  Patty.  I'm saying...  Patty.  What does this feel like?  You sound...  It feels weird.  You sound a little strange, Patty.  I feel tired.  Patty.  Are you tired?  You might see some hallucinations.  Yeah.  Like what?  Are you seeing anything?  Well, it's stuff that is in your imagination.  Patty, what are you doing?  Patty, explain what's going on. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Patty, what are you looking at?  We don't see what you're looking at.  Why are you staring...  What are you looking at?  Shut him up.  Patty, why are you staring at his crotch?  He has it out.  He has one out.  He has one out.  I see his anatomy sticking out of his cheek.  No, you don't.  Yeah, it's not right there.  What's wrong, Patty?  Oh, my God.  Why are you screaming?  His pants are zipped up.  What's the problem?  Yeah.  Oh, this is insane. 
[00:37:00]  And she's gone.  Do you want to see his...  No!  It's there.  It's not there.  No.  I see it.  It's there.  You want to see what?  It's already there.  I'm already seeing it.  See what, Patty?  We don't see any...  What are you seeing?  Patty, I'm looking right where you are.  We definitely should have gave her a half one.  You want to see his...  What's the matter with you?  She's staring...  Oh, my God.  Wait, Patty, tell us what you see.  Tell us what you see.  I think it's real.  She's starting to see...  Is that what you see?  That's really what you see? 
[00:37:30]  That is a hell of a trip, man.  Patty, come on.  Look at it again.  Look at it again.  Are you sure?  Look at it again.  Are you sure?  Patty.  Oh, my God.  Is it real?  Look at that.  She's staring at his...  What do you see right now?  He has his thing out.  He has his thing out?  You're hallucinating, man.  Feed your head, Patty.  Feed your head, Patty.  I swore his...  What a little potty mouth she turned into, too.  It certainly did. 
[00:38:00]  That show got a lot of talk, man.  That was a fun one.  That created a lot of talk.  Starker Patty.  Worst pothead ever.  Worst pothead ever is the name of that segment.  But the Patty videos, proud to say the Starker Patty videos are now up on Break.com from that fine show.  Thanks to Joe Rogan.  And Derek made that, and we need more of those.  Yeah.  Because that is just...  We were messing with her for over an hour.  Oh, there's plenty of audio.  Yeah.  She was seeing rabbits and guys in straitjackets. 
[00:38:30]  Monsters.  Monsters.  She started itching like crazy, and we kept telling her, stop itching.  And she goes, I'm not itching.  And she was.  She was just scratching her legs and her hands.  Then she fell asleep.  She was out cold for a while.  Well, you said just lay down and go to sleep.  And she went, okay.  And she just sat down, and she was out.  It was like talking to a Frankenstein robot.  She was dope.  She was out in seconds.  Can I...  I'm sorry, man.  Someone just out of paper.  I just saw it bug me. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, I just...  Iraq!  All right.  What happened now?  Iraq.  You realize you're the only one that has things happen to you on a regular basis, right?  Yeah.  The first thing that happened, and I'll be honest, the other day, Ops took up for you.  And if someone's going to stand up for you, you would think you would really make a concerted  effort so that that person wouldn't have to do it again.  Yeah, now you're losing me, too. 
[00:39:30]  Because the guys would always kind of, you know, goof on you for being late.  I'm trying to remember all the reasons he's been late.  Yeah.  They've just been a cavalcade.  Fridge broke.  Don't forget the refrigerated door.  The refrigerated door falling off was a biggie.  Falling off.  All sorts of things.  But, yeah, that's right.  It's always some kind of, yeah, weird thing.  So the guys were saying something, and Ops took up for you and said, you know, knock  it off.  And then today, there was a little message, I guess, that came in that you were going 
[00:40:00]  to be late.  The cops were over at your place?  Mm-hmm.  Now, is this for you?  No, it wasn't for me.  Oh.  When were the police there?  I was hoping it was for you.  Between 2 and 2.30 this morning.  For what?  There was a domestic disturbance at the apartment right next to mine.  Murder?  No, but the girl threatened to slice and stab her, I guess, fiance or husband.  See, when you live in an apartment, these things happen, you know? 
[00:40:30]  Because I remember things happening next door to me, and I'd put my ear against the wall  and kind of listen in, and they'd be arguing, and it'd be kind of fun.  But you just kind of, eh, you don't give it a second thought, especially if you're half  asleep.  Were you asleep, and that woke you up out of a sound sleep?  Yeah, there was screaming, glass was being thrown, some furniture toppled, and then a little  later, the cops knocked on our door and a few other doors, asking what we heard and who 
[00:41:00]  actually called the police.  So, when the cops came to your door, when did they take your alarm clock away?  That is a goddammit, that's exactly what I was trying to do.  We're going to have to take, this is valuable evidence.  When do they decide, you know what, we have to take this.  Put the clock in the car, Junior.  We have to take this alarm clock away.  Daddy, my hair blew off.  I hope your goddamn clock was in it. 
[00:41:30]  When I get home, I'm going to punch your alarm clock right in the mouth.  So far, so good, but I can't get past the fact that you still had an alarm clock.  You looked a lot taller on my clock radio.  That alarm clock is not an attention getter.  Oh, E-Rock, so what did happen with the alarm clock? 
[00:42:00]  That, I couldn't tell you.  Oh, Jesus.  That's just wonderful, E-Rock.  So you got up for a few minutes, and then went back to, what happened?  You collapsed back in your little bed, and you just went to wake up.  Uh, I believe it was 5.40.  This is what he said to his girl.  Let me have a Diablo sandwich, a Dr. Pepper, and make it fast.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  I'm in a goddamn hurry.  That's how he sounded, just a Diablo sandwich and an alarm clock. 
[00:42:30]  That's what he said as soon as he woke up late.  Great.  So 5.40.  Wow, you're so on your own now, E-Rock.  Good luck to you.  What time were you supposed to get up?  You lost your biggest support.  What time did you usually get up?  Between 4 to 4.15.  So you ever slept by 90 minutes?  Yeah.  What woke you up?  Hunger pains.  Fire department coming to the window of a flaming apartment.  Yeah.  I had hunger pains, man.  But I think it was hungry.  Oh, E-Rock. 
[00:43:00]  What woke me up was being repeatedly elbowed saying,  your phone is ringing.  Answer it.  How come you're all sleepy now?  Yeah.  I'm not really sleepy.  You're very sluggish.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of.  Numb.  Numb.  Why are you numb?  You should be more awake than any of us.  You got 90 extra minutes.  Yeah.  Oh, what I would do at 90 minutes.  Are you kidding me?  I'd be doing cartwheels in this place.  Do you know how happy I am when I get up and I see my alarm says 5.18 or 5.17?  I go, oh my God, I can sleep till 5.29.  I reset it for 5.29. 
[00:43:30]  You can rub it in, you bastard.  12 extra minutes, I guess.  12 minutes is like.  Yeah, but I get a bed at 1.  I lay there like this with my face on the pillow and you look at the clock and you go, oh, I've got 4 minutes.  4 minutes left.  90 minutes.  What's better than waking up and you realize, oh my God, it's only 3 o'clock.  I can go back to sleep.  I just had to tinkle.  Is there anything better than going?  Complete sleep too.  Like you're like, okay, it's not even one of these.  I can shut my eyes in a few minutes.  You get some like quality hour time. 
[00:44:00]  I have an extra 40 minutes.  90 minutes.  So what are you numb for or tired?  My, um, this isn't a reason for anything, but my medicine is not working well with me.  Oh no.  So is this a medication thing?  Kind of.  What are you on?  Klonopin.  Holy mother of pearl.  Why are you on that?  Klonopin?  That's what the doctor gave me.  For what?  Jesus.  You got some kind of anxiety thing?  That's, they, when they ruled out the neuropathy, they went right for the anxiety. 
[00:44:30]  And, um, so I'm on that and a B12, um, supplement and shot.  It's like giving Karen Ann Quinlan a quaalude.  Why?  B12.  You're fine.  You're fine.  I mean.  I love how he like, he puts the Klonopin in the same category as a B12 shot.  B12.  Wow.  Watch out for the B12.  I'd like a Flintstones chewable and a Vicodin.  Right.  Right. 
[00:45:00]  That's a deadly cocktail.  You're doing a Belushi on us.  Okay.  Yeah, that's a, that's a good point.  So the medicine makes it hard to hear alarms.  Yeah.  But not domestic violence next door.  Right.  Exactly.  That's a good point.  Dude, get off the effing Klonopin.  Maybe you should hire that couple.  Klonopin.  Come next door at 415 and just fight next to your bed.  What, what's the, no?  What's the Klonopin supposed to do?  Um, the Klonop, they, it's supposed to, uh, like when I was having breathing problems and 
[00:45:30]  everything, if you feel like you're having a, uh, panic attack, I guess, or some kind  of buildup.  You are really high right now.  Oh, yes.  Holy Jesus.  You're like, you're kind of slurring your speech a little.  You're not supposed to take it, uh, before or during work.  You're supposed to take it late in the afternoon or evening.  So when did you take it?  Five.  In the morning?  It was like 8.30, 9 o'clock. 
[00:46:00]  You took it before.  Dude, my, my mom, uh, she's got severe OCD.  She, she does the Klonopin.  Get the F off the Klonopin.  What you need, it's so simple.  A smack in the face.  I could, I could, I could cure all your problems.  You need to eat right and exercise.  All this crap will go away.  I'm telling you.  Hey, Tom Cruise over here.  You're being glib, Hopi.  I'm telling you though.  In his case, that's a big problem.  Yeah, that is.  Huge.  You know how much caffeine he drinks a day with his iced tea?  Knock off the caffeine, exercise and eat better. 
[00:46:30]  And you will, first of all, you'll pass out going to sleep and then, uh, you'll get  a healthy regular because you're tired sleep.  Right.  And then you'll wake up and you'll notice, uh, uh, that you won't have, uh, apnea and  problems and things like that.  It was, it was supposed to, that was the other thing.  It's supposed to help with the sleep because I couldn't stay asleep.  Well, it just keeps you asleep.  Even if your apnea tries to wake you up, this keeps you out.  Good Reggie White.  You're going to wind up dying in your sleep.  Because you can't, when you wake up because of apnea, that's your body going, ah, you're 
[00:47:00]  going to die.  Because you've stopped a function that is necessary for life.  Do you go as EROC111 online?  No.  Hmm.  You sure?  Positive.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, let's see.  Hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Do you play, uh, any PlayStation games?  I don't have a PlayStation.  Online?  Okay.  All right, just asking.  All right, well, there you go.  We got a drugged up, uh, EROC today.  That's just terrific.  I'll tell you what, though, the, uh, yeah, the, the eating right and exercise, you will 
[00:47:30]  go to bed and fall asleep because you're tired.  Your body is tired from doing what it's supposed to be doing.  Uh, taking drugs to get to sleep, stuff like that, mm, no, not good.  Make yourself tired.  Dude, you're doing good, man.  You are eating better.  It's hard.  It's real hard, but just work out a little bit.  You stop working out.  All right.  Not, no, but just not as much as I used to.  Dude, how old are you?  29. 
[00:48:00]  Jesus.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I didn't even have a candy bag yesterday, and then I went out.  You have no, you really have no, he has no real problems.  And the story.  Right, except for his numbness.  Yeah, the numbness.  That's from the Klonopin.  Numb.  It's called, the doctor just called him a numb skull, and he took it to heart.  He actually has to call in retarded for work.  Yeah, but that stuff to go to sleep is bad, man.  I don't even take melatonin when I get up in the morning. 
[00:48:30]  No.  Because that's a natural thing, but it will make me very sluggish on the air.  I can't do it.  Yeah.  Can't take it.  Can't do that.  All right, we got it.  Why don't you just take Darvacet or something else?  It's all bad stuff.  I don't know what that is.  I don't either.  I just like the way it sounds.  It does sound good.  Yeah.  That's serious.  Stupid drugs.  Prescription drugs.  Stupid prescription drugs.  How about some item?  Most of them are a waste.  All right, I'll stop taking it today.  Smoke some hash.  No, I'm not a doctor.  That's my opinion.  Don't just say, all right, I'll stop taking it.  No, you can't just stop taking what your doctor ordered. 
[00:49:00]  I believe you can solve a lot of things with a good diet and a lot of exercise.  Well, I'm a doctor.  Here's what I say.  Take Viagra and then blood thinners and just watch the fun begin.  Oh, thank God.  They won't know what to do.  Up, down, up, down, up, down.  It's like a clogged toilet with the water rising.  Oh, God.  How big is this thing going to get?  And then it goes back because the blood thinners wreck everything.  Take some diabetes medication.  You got to hoist it up with a crane. 
[00:49:30]  The blood goes to the tippy top.  It's like an overflow on me here.  All right, Iraq, whatever.  Do whatever you do.  It's a crap, you're sluggish, Eric.  You are sluggish today.  Are you capable of pushing a button today?  Can you man that post today?  Yeah.  Yeah?  All right.  Even on the dope?  Why don't you push that button, you junkie?  All right.  Go ahead, druggie.  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  That was a big delay, you rock. 
[00:50:00]  Oh.  Hey, good morning.  To all the pests in the audience today, it's O.B. and Anthony.  What's up, Boston?  Boston.  What's up, Buffalo?  Celebrating me third wife's demise.  Good afternoon, Cleveland. 
[00:50:30]  Mid-morning for Washington.  How are you guys?  Sorry.  Buffalo.  I said Buffalo.  Oh.  I like Sam Buffalo.  I said that already.  I like Sam Buffalo.  Buffalo.  They're good peeps up there.  They absolutely are.  Fox is getting a lot of crap, and let's hope they don't back off.  Really, there's a show called Back to You, and Fred Willard is on it, and apparently they  made a politically incorrect joke about Polish people, which kind of annoys me, because they 
[00:51:00]  wouldn't have dared said it about blacks or another ethnic group, but it's still a funny  line.  Apparently, Fred Willard at issue is a recent episode of Back to You, in which one character  said to another, bowling is in your Polish blood, like kielbasa and collaborating with  the Nazis.  I think it's a hilarious line.  Oh, wow.  That even reads funny.  Okay.  That's damn good.  That is a funny line.  Oh, is that a good one?  So what are they upset? 
[00:51:30]  Who's upset?  Polish people.  Nazis certainly aren't.  Polish people.  Like just any...  Oh, the Polish is called the...  Nazis certainly are not.  I'm a quarter Polish.  Uh-huh.  Not offended.  Not offended.  Not even a quarter.  I guess that doesn't work unless I was over half Polish, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, it's called the Polish Congress or something.  They want to sit down with Rupert Murdoch.  You know what?  Go F yourself.  I'm just reporting.  Wake up, people.  They want to sit down with Rupert Pupkin.  Right.  Oops.  They made a mistake. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  They're demanding to meet with Les Moonves over what was said at Fox.  They'll be pounding on Les's door and be like, what are you talking about?  It's not our show.  Yeah.  Go away.  Well, that's...  But, uh...  It's amazing.  People get such babies about anything racial, anything ethnic.  I know.  It's a funny line.  How do you not see that as a funny line?  You know what?  Run an episode of All in the Family.  That'll calm everybody down.  Just throw that on primetime TV nowadays. 
[00:52:30]  Right?  Speaking of controversy...  That brings up this story.  And, uh...  This one, I don't even know if I can agree with.  Really?  You know my stance.  Uh, yeah.  Parade Fuhrer.  You'll know the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade's coming up.  There's a traffic record.  Here in the city.  I know.  Ugh.  Why?  Why?  Can't there just be a parade field somewhere that we could hold all these parades in the city?  You know what?  And street fairs and stuff.  Just an area that isn't used for public transportation in the pinnacle of the free world. 
[00:53:00]  You know what?  It's the Macy's Day, Thanksgiving Day, Balloon Day, Eating Turkey Day parade.  That's the only parade that they should allow every year.  Because, like, people aren't really out.  No.  Working.  How do you make a point?  The only reason I say that is because everyone clears out of the city to go to Grandma's house.  And it's a perfect day for a parade.  No one's doing their thing in the city.  Okay.  Only this parade's allowed. 
[00:53:30]  That's what I say.  And because I don't want the mafia pissed off at me, I would go with the Columbus Day parade as well.  It should be held on a sinkhole.  They should make them walk in a circle in a sinkhole and just watch them occasionally plunge to their deaths and smothered by sod.  Well, you know, every year they add new balloons.  Yeah.  It's become a marketing thing for the most part.  Another way to just market movies.  Well, that's what it is.  Marketing.  And TV shows.  Yep.  And toys.  Toys.  It's a big, yeah, commercial is what these balloons have turned into. 
[00:54:00]  And let's see.  Parade Fuhrer.  One of the four new balloons in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade is causing a public uproar from citizens and politicians.  In an effort to promote the latest movie, Tom Cruise movie, Valkyrie, United Artists quietly signed a deal to include a Hitler balloon in this year's parade.  Other new balloons this year include Shrek, Hello Kitty, Super Cute, Sesame Street's Abby Cadabby. 
[00:54:30]  What the hell is Abby Cadabby?  I've never heard of Abby Cadabby.  And Care Bear's Winter Funderland.  Yuck.  Then we got a quote.  It's completely outrageous that Macy's would even think this is remotely acceptable.  They need to stand up and remove this balloon from the parade.  Hitler has no place in the Thanksgiving Day celebration, said Barry Klein, head of the Association for Protection of Jewish Heritage. 
[00:55:00]  We are calling for an immediate nationwide boycott and its subsidiary until the balloon, blah, blah, blah, pulled from.  Yeah, they want the balloon pulled from the parade.  Valkyrie stars Tom Cruise and centers around the plot to kill Hitler by a group of German officers in order to seize power to end World War II.  United Artists was revived last year by Tom Cruise.  The last film, Lions and Lambs, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They revived United Artists in their first movie as Lions for Lambs. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, good one.  Good comeback.  That was still on life support.  But, yeah, this story's pretty much just hit.  And, oof, there's going to be some outrage.  What do they mean by Hitler balloon, though?  One of the balloons is going to be in the image of Hitler.  Now, I don't know if it's going to be exactly like, is it going to be a giant Hitler balloon?  Or is it a balloon somehow tied into the movie? 
[00:56:00]  I think it's Hitler eating a turkey leg.  Dabbing his little mustache with a napkin.  Gotta love that.  It's got gravy in it.  And Goebbels is giggling at him.  You gotta love the headline, Parade Fuhrer.  Yeah, Parade Fuhrer.  Anytime Hitler comes up in the news and people are angry, they always say, Fuhrer.  Making it like they're angry, but he was the Fuhrer.  So, Hitler balloon is one of the new balloons included this year in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. 
[00:56:30]  And outrage, outrage from politicians, citizens, and certain groups.  Man, who the hell thought that would be a good idea?  Like, I'm one, I'm completely open, free speech, whatever the hell you want.  But that's a little, that's a little off when you think the little kitties are going to be around watching the parade.  And how do they, you know the stupid, they always get the stupid news people to anchor the parade. 
[00:57:00]  Yeah.  They're like, oh, and making its way around, here comes the cat in the hat.  Here comes the cat in the hat, ladies and gentlemen.  What a wonderful day.  And a beautiful day for this parade.  Uh, this is, um, great temperatures.  Look at, there's a happy young child looking at the cat in the hat balloon as it makes its way down the parade route on this Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Just a wonderful day.  Look at all the colors, the marching bands coming down the street. 
[00:57:30]  Oh, and there he is.  There he is coming down the street.  It's Adolf Hitler.  Adolf Hitler is making his way down the parade route.  You might remember Adolf Hitler killed millions and millions of people back in World War II before taking his own life after, uh, killing himself, uh, in the bunker.  He was brought out and, uh, burned, uh, by his, uh, troops so as not to be, uh, uh, his body captured by the Russians. 
[00:58:00]  But here he is making his way down the Thanksgiving Day Parade route.  Adolf Hitler balloon.  We got to find out more about this because that, that just sounds completely insane.  It really does.  And they're not going to have Katie Couric or whoever, whoever the hell they're going to have this year saying Hitler balloon on, on national TV.  And is he going to be flying?  Like, there's poses that these, that these things do.  Like, uh, I know Underdog is flying when they had the Underdog balloon. 
[00:58:30]  The cat in the hat was just kind of standing up.  That's, I think that's the one that hit the light post that took down, uh, a family a couple of years back.  Uh, that's a very tall one.  But the Hitler one, I would guess probably doing that little Heil me thing.  And, uh, maybe like leaned over a little bit so he fits under the lights.  That's, that's pretty effed up.  We have to find out more info on this.  And I don't know how detailed, uh, uh, a uniform he'll be wearing, but I cannot see anyone putting up with a swastika on the parade route. 
[00:59:00]  No, I think they'll, uh, if they are, I think they would have to do this in a taste.  How do you put, do a Hitler balloon tastefully?  I don't know.  There's no way to tastefully put Hitler balloon in, in, uh, the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  Well, the news story is calling it the Hitler balloon.  I'm thinking it's, I don't think Macy's.  You don't think it's that blatant?  No, I don't think they're calling it the Hitler balloon.  I think that, you know, how, how the news likes to, you know, sensationalize everything. 
[00:59:30]  They're calling it the Hitler balloon.  It's probably very subtle and very tasteful.  The way to do it tastefully is if he has a look on his face with his eyes rolled up like, all right, I screwed up.  All right.  I was naughty.  Let's, uh, say hi to Jeff in Jersey.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, how you doing guys?  Hey, pretty good.  I'm listening to you guys and I'm just like freaking out.  I can't believe these guys will come out with a Hitler balloon.  Yeah, I know.  It's, uh, we all got to calm down though. 
[01:00:00]  The news story is calling it the Hitler balloon.  I think it's got to be like, there's something else to this, obviously.  Maybe it has more to do with the movie than directly with Hitler, but they're calling it Hitler, the Hitler balloon.  I hope it crashes like the Hindenburg.  Oh, get out of the way.  Oh, that's the worst catastrophe I've ever seen.  Let's go to Corey in Columbus.  Corey, what's going on?  Good morning, boys.  Good morning.  I wanted to know, do you think the balloon handlers are going to be goose-stepping? 
[01:00:30]  Now, see, that would really be in poor taste.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Oh my God, Adolf Hitler balloon is making its way down the road.  Goodness gracious.  I guarantee you that Hitler balloon will be more charismatic than Roger Clemens was in Steinbrugger Fox.  Well, I'm back.  You'll be seeing me again, just not in the postseason.  I'm back.  I'm going to go four and six for you.  Or whatever the hell you want.  Yeah, real soon. 
[01:01:00]  Worst speech ever.  Yeah, let's say hi to Chris in Queens.  Chris, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  Hey, Kramer.  I'm 100% Polish, and I definitely wasn't offended by that.  I was more offended by that Abby Gabby stupid balloon.  Abby Cadabby?  Abby Cadabby.  I don't know what Abby Cadabby is, and they didn't have a picture of him in that article, but...  There you go.  The new balloons this year is the...  I have no idea what that is.  They're calling it the Hitler balloon.  Also, the Shrek balloon.  Hello Kitty.  Super cute.  Sesame Street. 
[01:01:30]  Abby Cadabby.  And Care Bears winner, Thunderland.  Balloon.  Hey, Jimmy, that line, we got it from Back to You.  Oh, okay.  We started the break with, what, they're in a little trouble about this line, and here  it is.  Fox, Fred Willard, yeah.  Oh.  Come on, Josh Whiskey, you're the best bowler at the station.  It's in your Polish blood, like kibasa, and collaborating with the Nazis.  Good line, man.  Funny line.  Kibasa is funny. 
[01:02:00]  Ah, that'll blow over, won't it?  Yeah.  I don't know.  The munchkins are getting their own star on high, I'm just watching munchkins.  Oh, God.  What creepy freaks.  The ones that are alive, there's like a bunch of little old people munchkins, and they're  getting their own star.  Really?  They should just cement them in the sidewalk.  So you could walk right over them, right over themselves.  Hi, how you doing?  Oh.  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look, one was in a little wheelchair.  It certainly was.  These guys.  Baby stroller.  How old are the munchkins now? 
[01:02:30]  Come on, everyone from that movie's dead.  68.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Wow.  But look at his ears.  It's Yoda.  It's Yoda.  He's the most wrinkled man ever.  Dude, I need a screen cap of that.  Wow.  They're singing.  They all have big ears.  Maybe munchkins have regular, maybe like these people have regular size.  Five years.  Little known fact, Jimmy, your ears continue to grow your entire life.  Why did it take 68 years, they're saying?  Should have taken longer.  Why would they get a star?  Look at everything.  And now the two Yentas are smiling and like, oh, what a great story, instead of going, oh, 
[01:03:00]  my God, did you see that freak's ears?  Exactly.  Look.  Bunch of stupid alcohol fetal syndrome victims 70 years later.  Hey, in other news.  That's Abby Cadabby.  Oh, what a cute little Muppet.  In other news, we lost a legend.  We lost a legend.  Do we have any of these old Big Star?  Squeeze the tomatoes.  Squeeze the melons.  But please don't squeeze the new Charmin bathroom tissue. 
[01:03:30]  Well, that's him, Dick Wilson, the man who played Mr. Whipple, and for more than 20 years has died.  But Charmin's most famous pitch man passed away this morning of natural causes in California.  Now, we all know him from those famous commercials.  But he also appeared in episodes of Bewitched, Hogan's Heroes, and the Bob Newhart Show.  Oh, well.  It was 91.  91.  Mr. Whipple.  Wow.  Okay.  He did all right.  You think they're going to line his coffin with Charmin? 
[01:04:00]  Charmin toilet paper.  Is it so soft?  What a creep he was.  I think he went on the bowl.  I hope so.  How ironic would that be?  I hope so.  And he was out of paper.  I hope he was reaching for a new role, and the strain made his heart stop.  And he died like Elvis.  He had to do the waddle across his house to find some toilet paper.  He died duck walking with his pants around his ankles.  A periscope behind him.  Good.  I think he was. 
[01:04:30]  Hey, Jimmy, I got a question for you.  Do you think Mr. Whipple liked the toilet?  No.  I mean, the way he would handle toilet paper, he'd be like, this guy loves toilet paper.  He loves it.  It's all he thinks of.  It's all he thinks about, huh?  Oh, what a creep.  Yeah.  A lot of other people were in those commercials with him, too.  Who?  Yeah, they were like, I don't know.  I really should check that out before I actually just blurt it out like an idiot.  It's an interesting point.  Of course, I'm going to go who? 
[01:05:00]  Or I'm just going to go who?  And I have nothing.  I think one of the Mythbusters guys, when he was very young, was one of the guys working  at the supermarket.  Wow.  That was caught squeezing the Charmin.  Really?  He got caught?  He got caught.  And Mr. Whipple yelled at him.  And then, of course, Mr. Whipple would, he'd yell at the person squeezing the Charmin,  go, please don't squeeze the Charmin.  And then he'd be standing there squeezing it.  And the person would turn around and go, Mr. Whipple.  And he'd go, ah.  And he'd pull it out and just start cranking. 
[01:05:30]  And he'd go, you know what it was?  Mr. Whipple said, I don't even realize I'm doing this.  My therapist told me to do it when I want to act out sexually.  I'd squeeze toilet paper.  It was hypnotic suggestion.  Mr. Whipple really thought he was attacking a hitchhiker with a hammer.  Constantly squeezing.  Creep.  The gentle chiding.  Oh, Mr. Whipple.  Oh, Mr.  Put that away.  You're within 500 yards of his school. 
[01:06:00]  He was a fondler.  He was a fondler.  There he is.  Look at him.  Look at him.  He takes it away from him.  He almost smacked her.  Look at that.  A hot blonde.  His bad comb over.  And he just wanted to squeeze the melons.  It's even softer.  Oh, and she's measuring how thick and the girth of it.  Yeah, Mr. Whipple carried his own little tape measure.  Yeah.  Which, believe me, he used to show off at other times.  Look what Mr. Whipple has for you.  It's the cardboard tube.  And she's rubbing the Charmin on his face.  And Mr. Whipple just loves it. 
[01:06:30]  Yeah.  All these bad 70s chicks rubbing toilet paper on their face.  Well, look at him.  Look at him.  It looks like he likes things rubbed on his face.  Good thing it's not a German or Japanese film.  The Charmin would come in much handier at the end of the movie.  For cleanup.  Two girls, one roll.  And even into the 80s and stuff, he's dressed like he's working at a general store from 1950 with the bow tie.  And that white lab coat.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  You think he was sick of talking about toilet paper?  Every day of his life, dude.  Every day of his life.  The second he came out of the house.  Right.  Hey, Mr. Whipple, did you squeeze the Charmin?  Are you going to be squeezing any Charmin today?  Do I get it?  And he probably hated Charmin.  Like in his house, he would use a bidet and socks.  Anything but Charmin.  Ripped up brown paper bag.  He wanted to pay penance. 
[01:07:30]  Mr. Whipple.  That's hysterical.  Hey, did you squeeze the Charmin?  Oh, sorry.  Mr. Whipple.  He's had it.  Part of the John Birch Society.  Angry Mr. Whipple.  He's a segregationist.  Stupid Mr. Whipple.  Well, Godspeed, Mr. Whipple.  I guess God needed a...  All right.  Toilet paper salesman.  God needed a wiper.  God needed a janitor.  Now he's an angel up on a cloud, and I hope it's as soft as his own Charmin bathroom tissue. 
[01:08:00]  Yes, yes.  Now he can wipe with a cloud.  He won't be wiping with a cloud.  All of a sudden, we'll be looking up and see things falling through the cloud.  What is that?  It's raining truffles.  We've got to finish the line, though.  God needed a what?  We don't have it.  A shill.  We'll figure it out.  A pederast.  A pederast.  A secretor. 
[01:08:30]  Let's say hi to Dan in East Meadow.  Dan.  Hey, boys.  How you doing today?  Pretty good.  Dan.  Do they call you Dan the man?  Shut up.  Cheers.  What do you got, Dan?  Oh, and hey, you guys missed a great line by Jimmy about the munchkin.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Anthony, you said that one of them was in a wheelchair, and Jimmy said, no, it was a baby  stroller.  Thank you, sir.  I did say that.  I didn't hear that.  Very good.  AJ.  Why you?  In Maryland.  What's up, AJ? 
[01:09:00]  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Good, man.  Good, bro.  Hey, a little while back, we sat at Hitler Balloon.  Yeah.  Dan had a pretty good line, and everybody missed it.  He goes, I cannot see anybody going for this.  Did you say I cannot see?  I cannot see anybody going for this.  Very good.  Yeah, there you go.  A Hitler Balloon is part of the parade this year.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, this news story is calling it the Hitler Balloon.  Obviously, that would be completely insane, so there's got to be more to this.  Hopefully, we'll get more info as the morning goes on here.  I'm just thinking, why would they call it the Hitler Balloon if Hitler isn't included 
[01:09:30]  in it?  True.  Like, if it's just a balloon about the movie Valkyrie, that's another thing.  I don't know.  Is there imagery in it?  Is it like a montage-type balloon where he's in it?  Maybe it's a misprint, and maybe they're actually Yurok's neighbors, and it's a hit  her balloon.  Hit her.  Get it?  A little funny wordplay.  A domestic...  All right, listen.  I should have Vaudeville hooks.  She dragged me off a chair after the wordplay joke.  I hit her balloon, folks.  No, he didn't.  Wah.  Wah, see? 
[01:10:00]  That was a cool show.  We're heading toward another break.  We got a great lottery story.  Lotto story.  A lotto winner that was keeping his winnings away from his wife.  Yeah.  And it wasn't a...  Keep it on the QT.  It wasn't a $1,000 scratch-off ticket.  No.  This was, like, the real deal.  Millions of dollars.  And he was like, I don't want to share this with my wife.  We got the story next.  It's a great one.  Also, bar owner tears customers' scrotum.  What?  How did I miss that one?  Well, we'll get into that next as well.  Tyson went to jail for, what, a day? 
[01:10:30]  Nah.  We got lots to do.  And let's not forget, tomorrow's the big day.  The dumb-off.  Dumb-off.  I cannot wait for this.  The dumb-off.  Rich Voss.  Yeah.  Rich Voss, Robert Kelly, and...  And Francine.  And Francine.  Who's dumber?  Wow.  Doing a little Jeopardy, so we get all their answers.  That's tight.  They're going to be writing down answers.  It's basically a rip-off of, are you smarter than a fifth grader?  Yeah.  We'll acknowledge that.  Of course it is.  But quiz stuff has been done for millions of years.  Yeah, but...  Millions.  Millions.  But we're not going to...  And he just goes, as a matter of fact, millions. 
[01:11:00]  They actually traced it back to Aztec.  Did they?  Yes.  But we're not going to be as...  Quiz shows.  We're not going to be as...  Throw you off the volcano or something if you...  No?  Sorry.  I lost track.  Are you smarter than a fig leaf?  That's when they did it back then.  But we're not going to be as nice as...  You went biblical.  We're not going to be as nice as Jeff Foxworthy.  No.  The other night he had Kelly Pickler on.  Oh, yeah?  Do we have the audio of that?  And he was...  Is she still playing stupid or... 
[01:11:30]  You think she's playing stupid?  Yes.  See, when she was on American Idol, I thought she was quite attractive.  But her dumbness just takes you out of the game.  Some people find that attractive.  I think she sees it as her claim to fame, so she pours on her dumbness.  She was so stupid on that show, and I was just begging.  I was yelling at my TV to Jeff Foxworthy,  Will you say something like...  Just go after her.  Did he hear you?  No.  Oh, damn.  I was kind of bonked in.  Yeah.  Plus the fact that it was a tape show. 
[01:12:00]  Can wear foil on your head.  Yeah.  And they hear you, but they can't read your thoughts.  I don't know.  It's like, come on.  I wanted him to just say, you're not this stupid, are you?  Yes, I am.  All right.  But we got our dumb off tomorrow on the Opie and Anthony show,  and in honor that the boys made this the last time Rich was in.  The History Channel and Jimmy Dean Sausage Links,  with a grant from the Picket Fence Dental Corporation,  present 20th Century American History, 
[01:12:30]  with renowned scholar and member of Mensa, Rich Voss.  I know a lot about it.  Dr. Voss will take you on a breathtaking journey  through history's most poignant milestones.  What event took the world to the brink of World War III in 1962?  The Bay of Pigs in Cuba.  Oh, my God.  Oh, no, the Russian Missile Crisis.  Oh, my God.  With every outburst, Rich Voss gets dumber and dumber.  In 1962, what almost brought us to World War III?  It had to be the Bay of Pigs in Cuba when... 
[01:13:00]  No, it's not the Bay of Pigs.  Your head will spin.  It was the U.S. president when World War II ended.  The war ended with the dropping of the atomic bombs.  That didn't actually end World War II.  You've never met a Jew who knows less about World War II than Rich Voss.  What was the World War where Germany was going in, taking, you know, just out of control?  By the way, I've never wanted to punch someone more than you.  Are you talking to me?  Yes.  It's pretty embarrassing when you think about it. 
[01:13:30]  So tune in to 20th century American history and watch an amazement as an old Jewish man goes from mildly coherent to babbling pile of mush in the course of an hour.  You know, you know, it's all history from there.  Coming to the History Channel.  All right.  Hey, this is Bill Burr.  I am going to be at Caroline's Comedy Club in New York City, right in Times Square at the crossroads of the world.  On December 6th through December 9th for tickets, go to www.carolines.com or 212-757-4100 for tickets. 
[01:14:00]  212-757-4100 for tickets.  Please come down and look at my big head.  I know you're out there somewhere, somewhere, somewhere.  I know you're out there somewhere, somewhere you can hear my voice.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[01:14:30]  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony with you.  Hey.  Taking a lot of phone calls.  That's our new thing.  If you've got something for the show, 877-212-ONA.  What else is America talking about today?  Well, we've got hate crimes rising 8%.  Are they? 
[01:15:00]  In 2006.  Never would have guessed it.  Now, you're good with stats.  What does that mean, Anthony?  It means hate crimes are rising.  Yeah, there's no way.  I won't even fudge those.  No other way to look at that?  I just see it kind of happening, yeah.  Hate crimes rose 8% in 2006.  There's a lot of hatred in this country right now.  I don't know what the hell the deal is.  It just is.  How much percent?  8%.  Over what?  That's crap, that stat.  All that means is the things they're classifying as hate crimes.  I was going to say.  Oh, very good, Jim. 
[01:15:30]  I think it has something to do with the definition,  which probably has been broadened over the years.  There was a gay guy who was targeted like they were doing gay sex hookups online at this park.  So this one guy, they targeted him to meet there just to...  JN?  No, no, no, no, no.  That's not accurate.  Oh, okay, sorry.  Oh, wait, that'd be Jim Norton.  Yes.  Yes, it would.  No, and so the guy, I guess they robbed the guy and killed him or whatever.  They were charged with a hate crime, but it was a robbery.  So it's crap. 
[01:16:00]  Anything done to a minority group is now considered a hate crime.  Anything done to white people is just considered a crime, and the motive is just the crime.  That's how you classify hate crimes.  All right, well, it's up 8% in 2006.  We got Tyson went to jail on that cocaine rap for a day, or is today the day?  That's it.  One day he got.  How did he get a day?  It would be funny if he got raped and shanked.  Comes out a completely different person.  Yes.  More tattoos and just... 
[01:16:30]  Huh?  How did he get a day?  How did Lindsay Lohan get an hour and a half?  That's like an incident.  Well, I don't think Lindsay Lohan's criminal career has spanned the scope of Mike Tyson's.  Well, why go through the whole process of putting someone in jail for a day or an hour?  Why don't you just tell her to clean up the garbage in the parking lot and be done with it?  Yeah.  It's so stupid.  But that, in Georgia, it's just how your criminal justice stinks.  That kid was 18 or 19 at a party, and the girl was like 17, or he was 17, she was 15. 
[01:17:00]  It was like a two-year difference, and they had oral sex, and he went to jail for 10 years,  and he's been in jail.  He's out now, but he spent all that time because of that stupid loophole in the Georgia law.  Right.  What about the kids with the little weed on them, and next thing you know, they're in jail for 20 years.  20 years for weed.  20 plus years.  People that kill people are getting in and getting out, and they still got to sit there because of a little bit of pot.  There are people in jail that long for that?  Yeah. 
[01:17:30]  Especially down south.  Randy Credico is a comedian.  I think he was fine.  What do they call those laws?  It's the Rockefeller.  Right.  Rockefeller law.  Yeah, I know this stuff.  Rockefeller.  What was it for?  What would they do?  Oh, I don't know.  I just know.  Oh.  Alton News is doing the Hitler balloon story.  Yeah.  Whoa.  They're doing a story on the Thanksgiving Day Parade.  They're showing balloons.  A montage of balloons.  There's the new ones, the Shrek.  Right.  But the big controversy is the Hitler balloon. 
[01:18:00]  There's Abby Cadabby.  A cute little Muppet.  Hello, Kitty.  Aw.  Hello, Kitty.  It's going to be a big one with the kids.  And then where does Hitler balloon fit in?  I don't even know.  Well, supposedly it's what?  Promoting the Tom Cruise movie Valkyrie?  Yeah.  Which is coming out in the summer?  They're coming back with it.  They just showed an outrage graphic.  I couldn't tell what that was.  Well, it was that.  It was very red.  Yeah.  Red and just like distorted. 
[01:18:30]  Yes.  Like you have a migraine headache.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It looked like it was pulsating.  Right.  That's anger.  The anger graphic on the news.  Oh, and then my favorite, the doctor with the dirty syringes.  They have got, they picked the worst picture of that guy ever.  What was he doing?  Dr. Finkelstein.  Dr. Harvey Finkelstein.  What happened to Harvey?  Harvey Finkelstein.  Harvey.  Harvey.  Harvey was apparently using dirty needles.  Okay.  He was reusing needles and medicine bottles and giving people injections and subsequently 
[01:19:00]  hepatitis and perhaps AIDS to some of his patients.  He literally should be dragged out by his hair and just shot.  It looked like.  We really in society need to start doing that.  We need to drag people out and just put bullets in them.  That would teach you to not reuse.  How much are you saving reusing needles?  Mr. Finkelstein.  Finkelstein.  And I've only seen one picture of him on the news.  It's the same picture and it's awful. 
[01:19:30]  It looks like they caught him in mid sneeze.  He's just kind of.  Looks like he just woke up.  Yeah.  He's got bed head.  He's got Larry Fine hair, first of all.  Hey, Moe, I'm reusing the needles.  He's got that hair and his eyes are all.  His glasses are askew.  How did he find out he was reusing them, though?  I guess when someone got hepatitis after going to see him. 
[01:20:00]  Maybe a nurse.  And they figured something out.  Yeah.  Someone had a rat about.  Needles aren't that expensive, first of all.  No.  And I think Jimmy's right.  I don't think you want to, like, get nuts in this country.  But I think if we just set a day aside, drag people into the street and put a bull in the back of their head.  That would calm a lot of people down in this country.  That's.  What does.  Yeah.  Sounds like you might want to celebrate the Hitler balloon.  If you start talking about those tactics.  No, no, no.  I'm just saying.  They didn't have crimes.  They were convicted of Hitler.  They were killing people for no reason. 
[01:20:30]  This is a guy who gave someone AIDS or hepatitis because he's a chiseler.  We're talking about.  Drag him out.  We're talking about justification here.  One to the back of the head.  For people that deserve it.  Okay.  For horrific things.  Oh, now you're making sense.  They're doing.  A foot on the hump in his back and then just a bullet.  Right.  So.  Any due process.  Bah.  Ah.  Well, yeah.  Ask the nurse.  Ask the nurse.  We don't need that anymore.  Ask the nurse.  Hey, also, we got Michael Vick.  He turns himself in to begin jail sentence on his dog fighting case.  Good for him.  He went in early because he's. 
[01:21:00]  It's so funny because he went in early and they're like, oh, that's showing some guilt and responsibility.  Oh, that's nice.  No, it's not.  But it's showing that he looked at the calendar and said, all right, if I go in now, there's  a very good chance I could be playing football.  Right.  When football season, you know, rolls around.  He'll probably miss.  Will he miss this season and next season?  Yeah, but I think he's trying to only miss one season.  I think they, I think he got together with his lawyers and they said, look, if you go in  now, there is a slight possibility we could get you back on that football field.  He's not doing it because he's taking responsibility. 
[01:21:30]  He's thinking about his future.  Sure.  Just getting it over with everything people do.  It's only thinking about damage control for yourself and, you know, how you can get back.  There's never any sincere apologies in this world.  It just doesn't happen that way.  People don't think that way.  No.  So when you see somebody do something like this, it's not because he's thinking, oh,  it was bad.  Yeah, you're absolutely right.  He's thinking, ah, if I go in now, I could time this out right.  So he's going in like 30 days early and then you got A-Rod winning his third MVP. 
[01:22:00]  Ugh, hate A-Rod.  Did he win it unanimously?  They said he might win unanimously.  26 of 28 first place votes, Jimmy.  Who else did they vote for?  And he's another guy saying that he has unfinished business in New York and that's why he re-signed  with the Yankees.  Unfinished business.  Such crap.  Unfinished business, please.  Nice chunk of change.  Yes, he had unfinished $275 million to collect.  That's unfinished business.  It's $275 million on the table.  I have some unfinished business. 
[01:22:30]  Take it.  Exactly.  He's a douche and he's not a postseason performer.  I would take Reggie Jackson and his, what, 260 average and dropping balls in right field.  I would be better in right field if I just used my mouth to catch the flies than Reggie was.  But Jimmy, Reggie Jackson's quite old.  I'd still take him.  You know why?  Because he performs in the postseason.  He wasn't a choking bum.  Yeah.  He wasn't a choking bum.  With A-Rod, he's so consistently bad in postseason. 
[01:23:00]  It's ridiculous.  And Jeter, you know what?  For all my dislike of Jeter, the guy postseason, fantastic.  Yeah.  He has just come up big year after year after year.  Rivera, I mean, with the exception of a few blown teams.  Wow.  Big year after year.  What a deal he just got.  Good for him.  $45 million.  They're also paying him for his past achievement, I think.  Let's go to Rick in Atlanta.  Was he being shortchanged for a while?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Of course he was.  Let's go to Rick in Atlanta.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  But, Rick, go ahead.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, man.  I saw that Hitler balloon on the CNN news. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah, we just saw it on local TV here.  Yeah, they were promoing, talking about it.  Hitler balloon part of the parade this year, the Thanksgiving Day parade.  Yeah.  How big do y'all think the riots are going to be up there?  I don't know.  There ain't going to be no riots, but there's going to be, like the graphic said, outrage.  Yeah.  Outrage.  And that awful red, I was going to say font, which isn't the right, of course.  It's just a red outrage. 
[01:24:00]  You look at it and go, I'm outraged.  The font is uncomfortable.  And the way it was pulsating was annoying me.  It was outrageous.  But this one, I don't know.  If they, well, hey, I can't see them going through with this, but I don't know who deals with what.  We're trying to get to the bottom of the Hitler balloon.  Hey, Tyson, this is the story.  It's quick about him going to jail for a day.  There wasn't much of a knockout scored against Mike Tyson. 
[01:24:30]  He was sentenced on drug charges.  It's a nut.  The former heavyweight champ was ordered to serve just a single day in prison.  He could have gotten four years.  Tyson's left guilty to cocaine possession and driving under the influence in Arizona.  Iron Mike begins his sentence tomorrow.  His lawyers say he has passed 29 drug tests and is attending drug and alcohol meetings.  There you go.  So that's how he skated?  What, saying he's going to attend meetings?  He's skating because he's a celebrity.  Yeah. 
[01:25:00]  Are you kidding me?  I'm watching this girl on Pal Talk.  I'm obsessed because her shirt is open and her bosoms are showing.  I'm really, really, very distracted.  Obsessed.  I really am.  The one in the flannel?  Oddball.  Yeah, she has a flannel shirt and it's open.  And she looks like Valerie Bertinelli, except Valerie never had heavy breasts showing.  They look good.  Never was a fan of Valerie Bertinelli.  Oh, she was cute.  Never a fan of that cutesy thing.  I'm still right.  That's irrelevant to her breasts.  What, were you more of a Mackenzie Phillips guy?  Exactly, Schneider. 
[01:25:30]  Schneider.  Hey, do we have time to do the bar owner or the lotto winner?  Lotto winner?  I want to hear about the bar owner.  All right, let's do the bar owner.  Very interesting story coming in.  Did we cover it?  We got the A-Rod.  Oh, Broncos beat the Titans.  Monday Night Football.  Whatever.  34-20.  Laws, no one got hurt.  I'd have picked a Titan over a Bronco, by the way.  I would have because a Titan would slip in them.  A Titan could crush a Bronco.  Yeah, but Broncos take dumps all over and Titans would slip in them. 
[01:26:00]  That might have worked.  You might have sold me on that.  A Titan would break his shin.  Listen.  A little angry.  Listen to the name of this guy.  It should make you laugh all day.  Tonight, the owner of a popular Twin City sports bar is accused of attacking a customer.  Investigators say a fight over a check got so ugly, the customer needed stitches to his genitals.  But officers say this isn't the first time the Brooklyn Park bar owner lost his cool. 
[01:26:30]  And they told our Caroline Lowell they have the video to prove it.  A warning for you.  The descriptions you will hear are graphic.  I like hearing that.  I just...  That is the best when the news does that.  It just makes you stop what you're doing.  Right.  Turn around and pay complete attention to what they're saying.  Meanwhile, they don't say that when they say 2,500 people killed in a cyclone in Indonesia or whatever.  They don't warn you that that's a problem to say, but they had scrotum all of a sudden.  Easy, folks.  Get the kids out of here.  This description. 
[01:27:00]  I've seen a lot of dead people from Bangladesh in the last few days.  You're right, Jimmy.  They're just garbage.  They really...  I love it when reporters just fall.  All right.  More to the story here.  We need some music, though.  We have a minority gentleman who stopped in here to get something to eat between Josh.  But by the time he left, he was in an ambulance on his way to the hospital.  This is a serious charge.  This is a serious incident that happened there.  Police say it all started when the customer and the bar's owner got into an argument.  So it's not like he was drunk and disorderly. 
[01:27:30]  There was a dispute over the amount of time it was going to take for his food, and he decided he didn't want to pay for it.  And for that, he ends up with these types of injuries.  Investigators say owner Thor Gunderson even tried to stop the man from calling 911.  Son of a Gunderson.  When they got to the bar, police said they found the customer bleeding and on the ground, restrained by Gunderson and a bouncer.  At the hospital, they determined that he had an injury, which was to his scrotum, and that one of his testicles was actually torn loose. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, my God.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Hello, exactly.  Ow.  Wow.  The guy was pretty much half castrated.  I hope someone wasn't asking for a martini with an olive at that given moment.  Excuse me.  Can I take that to the hospital?  Oh.  Anybody notice the opening of the story when the guy goes in, a minority gentleman stopped? 
[01:28:30]  What did that have to do with anything?  A minority gentleman.  Who cared?  Well, usually I would agree with you, Jimmy, but...  Oh, is there a reason?  Did it have something to do with it?  Yeah, this is the last part of the story.  Oh.  Yeah, here we go.  Here's the conclusion.  Police have also heard accusations that blondies mistreats African Americans.  Now, when we checked the year's worth of police calls to the bar, some customers said they felt racially discriminated against.  Gunderson didn't want to talk with us about the allegations he has been charged with felony assault and interfering with an emergency call. 
[01:29:00]  Gunderson's attorney says other witnesses don't agree with the police version of the story, and he says they will present their side in court, not in the media.  Okay, well, that makes me feel silly.  Oh, boy.  Don't I just feel like a boob?  Oh, boy.  All right.  Let's say hi to John in Ohio.  Good afternoon, John.  How are you?  I'm doing great, boys.  All right.  Thank you, John.  You love the show.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Hey.  I'm kind of wondering if, after the parade, if you're going to try to buy the Hitler balloon to fly in your backyard. 
[01:29:30]  No, I shan't be buying the Hitler balloon to fly in my backyard, sir.  You know, check out bestgaming.com if you get a chance.  All righty.  All right.  Thank you, John.  I'd be surprised if the thing sees the light of day, but we'll have to wait and see.  Hey, why don't we take a break?  On the way, we got the lotto winner who's trying to hide the money from his wife.  Oops.  Also, well, a couple other things here. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, I have some good news.  What, Jimmy?  It's about my Borgata show.  Oh.  What do you got?  Saturday sold out, so Friday.  Nice.  Oh.  January 18th is the only availability.  The Borgata.com Saturday is sold.  Very cool.  More with Opie and Anthony in just a bit.  Opie and Anthony.  And you listening.  I like that combination.  Hey, we were talking about the Munchkins.  Yeah. 
[01:30:30]  We were trying to figure out how old they are.  Mm-hmm.  They're in their 80s and 90s.  How does a little, like, bizarre thing like that stay alive that long, especially when  that long ago, they didn't have the type of medicine they need?  Disease ignores you.  It feels too bad for you already.  Cancer just skips right over you.  Goes right over your head.  Like, what, am I going to spend five minutes in this thing?  I want to live a little myself, right? 
[01:31:00]  I'm taking a vacation to an island the size of this room.  Yeah.  Why don't you do it?  Yeah.  Little people are supposed to, like, not live a long life, so I don't know what this is  about.  Maybe we could get a professional on the line to explain this, but the Munchkins, we were  doing our show, and who gives a crap about the Munchkins, but they did a little story  on TV.  They're getting what?  A star on the Walk of Fame out there in Hollywood?  Yeah.  The Hollywood Walk of Fame.  They're finally getting their due.  They're getting a star. 
[01:31:30]  I guess all of them together, it's just going to say the Munchkins?  Yeah.  Great.  Here's the story.  You all right, Jimmy?  Oh, dude.  I'm really, I'm, I'm filling up.  Jesus, Jimmy.  The, uh, I guess the shirt just came off the shoulders.  It did.  And, uh, Jimmy's, uh, Jimmy's preoccupied.  They're just breasts staring at me.  They're just begging to be, to be, just poked.  That's what I do with breasts.  I poke them.  I don't do anything dirty, just poke them.  I go, ha, ha.  And I make horn noises. 
[01:32:00]  Meh, meh.  No, the girl is, uh, on Pal Talk teasing with a flannel shirt all morning long.  And now she's slowly but surely losing, uh, the flannel shirt.  And it's, uh, completely taking Jimmy out of the game right now.  I haven't looked at Pal Talk in a while, to be honest with you.  I just occasionally glanced.  Yeah.  But this one, because E-Rock usually has a screen black or some chat he's having.  So it's like, I don't get to see a lot of breasts.  Uh, well, here we go.  The Munchkins finally get their star on the Walk of Fame.  This is something that caught our eye. 
[01:32:30]  They are part of American movie lore, The Munchkins.  And now they have a star on the Walk of Fame.  And they, seven to nine surviving members sat down with our Andrew Canning.  They are the lovable little people who first captured America's heart.  Why are they lovable?  Just because they're small?  Exactly.  They might be just horrific people in their private lives.  Yeah.  Could be wife beaters.  They could easily be wife beaters.  Punching her in the...  Yeah, punching her in the...  She has to wear, like, long dresses instead of, like, eye makeup. 
[01:33:00]  Because she's bruising her thighs and knees.  I think if you live on this earth as a little person for 90 years, I don't think you're lovable anymore.  No.  I think you're a bitter old ass.  You're a grouch.  Oh, man, you have to be.  It's a grump.  Who first captured America's heart in 1939 in The Wizard of Oz.  Because, because, because, because...  Because, because of the royal thing she does.  Oh, boy.  It's the only line, you dummies. 
[01:33:30]  Oh, they made him do it.  We were just talking about Mr. Whipple and how he has to, like, say...  Please don't squeeze the Charmin.  That's all he had to say for 50-some-odd years.  Go ahead.  That was them doing it in, like, real time, like now.  They made them do it now.  Knowing that they're going to mess up their only line that they need to remember.  Yeah, they showed the original and then they showed the old fogies sitting there and trying  to do it, failing miserably.  The first captured America's heart in 1939 in The Wizard of Oz. 
[01:34:00]  Because, because, because, because, because...  Because of the royal thing she does.  Because of the royal thing she does.  But to say, these original munchkins, now in their 80s and 90s, still have the magic.  God damn.  The yellow brick road has finally led them to this yellow carpet on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  All they have is shoes with lips and embarrassing family photos.  They should be forced to sing that line in a pit bull cage. 
[01:34:30]  Like three fighting dogs.  Last midget standing.  Wow.  If I was related to one of those, like, I would just make them wear the costume all the time.  They would always have to dress...  And walk around with that big lollipop.  Yeah.  Those little white knickers and shiny shoes.  But I don't want to dress like that.  It's embarrassing.  Shut up or you don't eat.  Big huge lollipop.  Put all the food up high where you can't get it, stupid.  With a spiral design on the lollipop. 
[01:35:00]  You just lick that in a circle until you get dizzy and pulled out.  Drill my fist into your cheekbone.  Who do we hate them?  I want to bully an old...  Not only an old person, but a munchkin.  I want to savagely bully one.  Because I'm not a big guy.  I'm not a good bully.  But one of those I could really push around.  Like a finger in the chest.  I told you to get me something.  You think it would feel good to boss a little munchkin around? 
[01:35:30]  Not even boss him around.  Savagely bully him.  Like right now I have my middle and my pointer finger together like one thick finger.  And I would poke his chest.  I said, get the paper.  And I'd make him carry his teeth like a dog.  And then get my slippers.  And he wouldn't be allowed to watch TV sitting in a chair.  He'd have to curl up on the couch like some small pet.  And I would just nuzzle his head.  It would be hysterical if they dropped a star on top of them.  Oh. 
[01:36:00]  I lost the rest of your thoughts.  Sorry.  Alright, here we go.  How does it feel for all of you to finally get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame?  The best picture ever made.  The whole world saw this movie.  And now we got our star.  The Boys of Oz is not only for kids.  It has such a meaning to it.  Because everybody can have a heart.  No heart?  Everybody can have a brain if they use it.  Oh, wow.  Do you notice how they weren't represented?  They should have sent one of them along.  If I only had two more feet of height. 
[01:36:30]  If I only had shoes with lips.  And the only reason they get a star is because they're the only ones left.  Believe me, they'd much rather give it to anyone.  If the dog was alive, they'd give it to him before.  You little embarrassments.  They should just dip their whole bodies in cement at Grumman's Chinese Theater.  Just smash their face into it.  Here you go.  Look, my foot's as big as a munchkin.  Believe me.  The studio would rather have dragged out Burt Lahr's Rotting Corpse and propped that up 
[01:37:00]  than to listen to you babble about how you finally got your due 70 years later.  The greatest movie ever made, was it?  Exactly.  Because you were in it, dummy.  Better than Apocalypse Now, you self-centered little nothing.  Give you a kick right in your small liver.  That's what I want to do to one of them.  Poke his chest and then spin karate kick his little liver.  His little innards. 
[01:37:30]  Oh, I want to bully a munchkin.  You can imagine.  Their petition for a star was denied until Hollywood heavyweights Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Ted Turner spoke up.  We're up to the same division.  For the most part, Hollywood is now a memory for this tight-knit group, but the Emerald City is never far away.  The Emerald City, do you mean heaven because they're all old?  You might be right.  What do you mean the hospice?  Is that Emerald City, where they're going to be rotting, trying to tell some orderly raping them what movie they were in? 
[01:38:00]  Hey, don't do that.  I was.  All you see is that Luther Vandross fist cracking in that little face.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow, stop.  But I was.  Ow.  I was a munchkin.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, they're awful.  We represent the...  Ow. 
[01:38:30]  Ow.  I'm just trying to sing and remember when I was happy.  Oh, they're being brutalized with a sock in their mouth so they can't holler.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Just a bad dream, little boy.  Little teeny fellas freak.  Why wouldn't they give him a star?  I like the fact that Tyler just kept saying no.  No.  No.  No.  They are pretty famous.  I mean, that's a pretty...  Yeah.  I mean, even at 80 and 90 years old, you recognize them. 
[01:39:00]  But they're no different than any of the other ones.  You could have put up five midgets there that were from Utah and had never seen the movie.  I go, isn't that cute?  They're still alive.  I would have no idea.  Yeah.  How do we know it's the actual midgets from the movie?  No.  The family doesn't even recognize them.  No one knows.  They just have big ears and you kind of look away.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Good for them.  What about the Oompa Loompas?  Why don't they get something?  They get nothing.  Because they're dark?  Yeah.  Probably.  It's racism.  If I was an Oompa Loompa, I'd be pretty mad today. 
[01:39:30]  Where's my star?  Hold on.  I can't see the screen because it's black again.  By the way, when they remade Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, whatever the hell they  ended up calling it, instead of Willy Wonka, that's what ruined the freaking movie.  What?  They had one Oompa Loompa.  Yeah, it was just one guy.  One guy that they superimposed as many.  Why?  I don't know.  That was so stupid.  Superimposed?  No, but that's...  Huh? 
[01:40:00]  Oompa Loompa Loompa Doompadidoo.  I like this song.  I got another puzzle for you.  Yes.  Oompa Loompa Loompa Doompadidi.  If you are wise, you'll listen to me.  Doompadidi.  Guess who drank when she was pregnant with me?  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  Wow.  Poor Oompa.  Goodness gracious. 
[01:40:30]  Oompa Loompa Loompa Loompa Doompadidi.  My chromosome count is short by three.  Boosdy boosdy bop.  Diddy bop.  Jesus.  Poor little bastards.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Fuck.  What? 
[01:41:00]  He wanted to yell out a curse word, it sounded like.  But Chris, what does that accomplish?  It gets dumped out of.  Why don't you explain why you would just call up and curse?  I don't get it.  He had nothing.  All right, here we go.  Let's move on to the lotto winner.  This is a great story, man.  This is a terrific one.  Listen to this.  One Florida woman is suing her husband, saying he won the lottery and then left her in the lurch.  Donna Campbell says her husband won a $10 million lottery jackpot with several co-workers and kept it a secret. 
[01:41:30]  She says he unplugged the televisions in their home and even disconnected the phones so she wouldn't find out.  Now, Campbell got suspicious about the windfall when she saw a postcard congratulating him on his new home.  That's when she Googled him and saw his name listed as a winner.  Campbell says even though her husband has now completely disappeared, she still loves him and just wants a resolution. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah, right.  Just a resolution, thanks.  That's a rough one, though.  You've got to kind of share that.  When you're married and you win the lottery, that's one you've got to split.  But that's not one you earned.  If you're married and one of you wins the lottery, you've got to split it.  Yeah?  Yeah.  But you went in with your workmates.  That's a help.  And, you know.  No, you have to.  No.  No, you don't.  But if she wins, I won half.  I'm not for splitting anything. 
[01:42:30]  I understand that.  This guy disappeared, too.  That's hysterical.  He wins.  He just left.  He just left.  And the fact that he's trying old sitcom ways that she doesn't find out unplugging the TV where they're perfectly clipped out squares out of the newspaper she was looking at.  I wonder what this was.  Or just the face cut out and the name blacked out of the winners in the paper.  Yeah.  He unplugs the thing and disconnects the phone.  But he doesn't think to check the mail. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  How about check the mail, idiot?  Congratulations on your windfall.  Gotta give him credit, though, for trying, you know.  Yeah.  Just disappearing like that.  Where is the guy?  Have they found him?  Loose ends.  No, he's gone.  I don't think he's guilty of a crime.  More Hitler balloon on TV.  Oh, this story is gonna blow up.  Balloon, can it blow up?  No.  That's part of the Thanksgiving Day parade.  Parade outrage. 
[01:43:30]  Outrage being sparked.  Well, according to the story, Parade Fuhrer.  Yeah, Parade Fuhrer.  Fuhrer.  It's all to promote Valkyrie, that Tom Cruise movie about the attempted assassination of Adolf Hitler.  And, you know, the Thanksgiving Day parade has become of late.  All the balloons and floats are pretty much advertisements for movies and whatnot.  And it's usually kids' movies.  But I guess United Artists decided they were gonna try to incorporate one of their movies into the Macy's Day parade. 
[01:44:00]  Well, it's a...  Thanksgiving Day parade.  They got Shrek 3 covered with the Shrek balloon.  They got Sesame Street.  Hello Kitty is a new one this year.  Yeah, Abbey Cadabbey, the Care Bears, Winter Thunderland.  And what is only being described as the Hitler balloon.  Well, they gotta be outrageous, you know.  To, uh, yeah, to, um...  They gotta sensationalize the whole thing.  Promote Valkyrie.  So, I don't... 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, is it gonna be the musical accompaniment?  And making his way, uh, down, uh...  This is just beautiful.  Adolf Hitler coming down...  Goodness gracious!  ...on this beautiful day for a Thanksgiving Day parade.  As you see, Hello Kitty has just passed us by as the Fuhrer brings up the rear.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wonderful.  You know what?  Fat, goofy balloon feet?  Ha, ha, ha.  And fat, like, white-gloved Mickey Mouse balloon hands?  People are, uh, sobbing on the ground in the fetal position as the Hitler balloon goes by. 
[01:45:00]  Others are just throwing rocks at him.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  I can't see, uh, the Hitler balloon getting a real big ovation.  The shirt's gone, by the way, Jim.  Well, I bet you it's gonna be nothing.  It's the news that is making it bigger than it is.  Yeah, yeah.  I do believe.  Yeah.  All right, uh, and Cindy Lou, who cries.  What?  There's a lot of weird stuff happening in New York City. 
[01:45:30]  Cindy Lou?  From, uh, The Grinch That Stole Christmas.  There was supposed to be this massive, uh, new production, The Grinch That Stole Christmas.  Uh.  For Broadway?  Broadway.  Broadway, uh, the lights are dark on Broadway.  They're striking.  They're striking.  These actors must want to strangle these stagehands.  I don't know what they're fighting for.  I know what the writer's strikes about, but I don't know what they're fighting for.  They want more stagehands.  They want, like, to be able to hire more stagehands for a production.  Like, there's a certain amount of stagehands that are allowed to be hired for a production,  depending on how big it is, I guess. 
[01:46:00]  And they want to up that number.  And, uh, they're saying no.  That's it.  In a nutshell.  So, I phoned it in.  People love Fargo.  I can't get enough of that goddamn movie.  Uh, anyway.  How many more do they want that it's like...  I don't know.  I know.  It's just, uh.  20 stagehands to carry a chair.  Stop it.  Put the shows back on.  What about the Grinch, though?  What if you came to see the Grinch?  Exactly. 
[01:46:30]  I guess you won't be able to.  Toughen up.  You're in New York.  Do something else.  Yeah, go to a peep show or something.  Take the kids.  Take the kids.  They love it.  Yeah, here we go.  Mommy, what's that?  How the Grinch Stole Christmas, get it?  Hmm.  The Grinch would be the, uh, Strikers.  Well, the producers of one Broadway musical are headed to court this morning.  They agreed with the stagehands to let the show How the Grinch Stole Christmas go on,  despite the strike.  But now the theater owner is shutting it down.  I really want them a lot, a lot to try so we can go on stage. 
[01:47:00]  Sorry.  There's a heartbreaking plea from Athena Ripka, who just made her Broadway debut as Cindy  Liu, who, in Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas.  Local One voted to reopen the Grinch, but theater owners responded by locking the Grinch producers  out.  We really need to take action tomorrow.  So what we are going to do is go to court and try to get our show open.  Wow. 
[01:47:30]  This was about the chick crying, I guess.  That's great.  Yeah.  Is that a real crying?  Yeah.  She's like a little actress.  Oh, is that great?  A little 13-year-old actress.  Oh, so she was just acting.  Oh, she's 13?  I think so.  Oh.  Great.  Thank you.  Hey, do we have any ho-ho-ho-y?  Can we play some ho-ho-ho-y?  There's no lyrics in that.  I know, but the freaking riff is amazing.  Did you find the ho-ho-ho-y?  Are we going to get him in to play the guitar this year?  Yeah. 
[01:48:00]  You should.  I believe so, yeah.  He plays Christmas songs.  Yes.  Well, ho-ho-ho-y does a great instrumental of How the Grinch Stole Christmas.  You got it?  You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.  Yeah, listen to this.  Yeah.  I like this.  We'll just play a little taste for your community today.  Here we go.  Ho-ho-ho-y. 
[01:48:30]  Ho-ho-ho-y.  How cool is that? 
[01:49:00]  Just a little taste.  Ho-ho-ho-y.  There you go.  Ho-ho-ho-y.  And we're saying it very weird in honor of Roger, who used to, I think, work.  Good morning to all the linger-lungers out there. 
[01:49:30]  Hey, we got that Munchkin story, and then people, this is what I love about the radio show, because  your feedback is very important to us.  It's kind of like the people's radio show.  We're kind of like driving along, and then you suggest something, so then we go over  here for a little while, then we come back on the highway.  We were talking all over the place.  We're like drunks.  But it's cool, though, because the listeners kind of direct the show some mornings.  It's really a lot of fun, because we don't even know where we're going to end up going.  And when we were talking about the Munchkin, someone said, you've got to play the clip 
[01:50:00]  of Cartman laughing at the midget from South Park.  Yeah.  I would like to share with you all my...  No, dude, no way!  Dude!  That words are like bullets.  And if you give...

[01:51:00]  That should be on TV, but there's no outrage because it's a cartoon  Hilarious  I'm telling you, we've got to turn ourselves into cartoon characters  We'll get away with murder with this show  They put a little suit on  How great is that clip?  Oh, no, I wanted to say something  Oh, no  Well, let's say hi to Steve at Buffalo, listening on the edge  Steve, what's up, buddy?  Hi to Steve  What?

[02:08:30]  Like lady's back  That's a fact  Ain't holding nothing back  Oh, she's a  Oh  Well, put together  Everybody knows  This is how the story goes  The echo  You were really mad at Danny yesterday, weren't you?  Oh, boy, you was, huh?  Yeah, I was a little bit heated  I was a little bit heated  Man, you yelled, though  That was you  As I picture  That was me  As furious as I could get 
[02:09:00]  Before someone's face got mushed into a wall  That was the old Steve in front of, like, one of the clubs in Boston  Yeah, that was  I had to, like, kick someone's ass  Were you hoping for a different reaction  Instead of everyone openly laughing at you?  Well, that kind of hurt  That must have hurt  That must have hurt your feelings  I've been working hard to temper my temper  And I realized  I, like, about five seconds after that  I had to take myself out of it  And just say, I'm done  No, it's only  Temper my temper?  Yeah, exactly  All right 
[02:09:30]  Hey, uh  It's only when Sam does it  Here's another remix with the Steve noises  That's a good one  That's all you get  That's all you get on that one  And then, unfortunately  I think it's an obscure Kiss song  Tears Are Falling by Kiss 
[02:10:00]  Oh, this is a good one  No, that was a huge hit  I don't remember this one  I remember this one  This was a single back in, like, 85  That was a big hit for them  I think, yeah  Yeah, this is the non-makeup years  Kiss in 85  This is an obscure hit  No?  No, it was  I remember it, though  I don't remember this song  This and Heaven's on Fire  They had a few that were really big  This and Heaven's on Fire  They were big MTV songs, yeah  Okay, well, here's, uh  When they were dressing  When Kiss was dressing  With, like, the little bandanas  Around the weight  Like, the, uh  Yeah  God, they were cool  That is great, man 
[02:10:30]  Who did that one?  They gotta get credit for that, man  That was, uh  That was Cradle of MILF  Cradle of MILF  Uh, sent that in  That is very, very funny  Oh, no, no

Tom Turkey  Tom has turkeys for us  The hallway's full of them  Remember last year  Poe being upset for not getting one  I, uh  And can I say this line  Are they gonna dump out?  No, they'll dump  Well, Poe said it  No turkey for the blank  Say it  They, um  He said, no turkey  For the spics 
[02:11:30]  That's what Poe said  He's, um  He's, um  And that's what we thought  Yeah, well, Poe  Poe is, uh, Hispanic  So, uh  He thought there was  Some kind of racial  Uh, plot going on  That kept him from getting a turkey  And he goes, oh  No turkey for the  And then added in a slur  For a Hispanic gentleman  Yeah  Um, I don't want my turkey  Giving him a homeless guy  I can't, uh  It's frozen  It'll be fun just to watch him  Holding a frozen turkey  And not being able to cook it  Here, hold this, stupid

[02:13:00]  Bleeped out of the bit  Well, now  It was the word chink, right?  Who beeped it out?  Was it us?  Or was it  Was it beeped out  For a regular radio player  Of all time  We don't know  I don't know  But we gotta find out  Yes  I mean, you can't get in trouble  For something you did  Seven years ago, can ya?  That's like a rerun  That's like a rerun, man  That's like  I was just telling that  Before we went on air  That's like, uh  Finding the, uh  Surviving members  Of All in the Family  And getting them in trouble  For half the shit  They did back in the day  You can't 
[02:13:30]  We can't get in trouble  For something that's  Seven years old, can we?  Can we, uh  Klonopin boy?  Who beeped out that word?  Oh, that was pulled off  One of the old dads  It was beeped  Oh, it was already beeped?  It was already beeped  Oh, it was  Was that the first time  That was played?  Look at his belly  No, we played it for a while  It's like poking out  Let me see your little belly  It was poking out  Look at your little belly  Eric wears the worst shirt  To hide a stomach  That's why  He wears like long  Thin man shirts  Yeah  It's an extra large t-shirt  Well then  Has the Klonopin, uh 
[02:14:00]  Worn off?  It's better now  But not, uh  Still a little fucked up  A little, but, uh  You don't need Klonopin  I know, I'm gonna  Get off the dope, son  You gotta get off the dope, son  There's a real problem  In this country  With prescription drugs  There's a fucking drugstore  Not enough of them  Drugstore in every fucking corner  I don't  I've never taken anything  I didn't even want it  But she was insisting  That I would need it  So  The goal is to get  Everybody on drugs 
[02:14:30]  And then they can take over  Because we'll all be docile  That's right  Docile  They  Thanks Klonopin  Being them  I don't  Eric has more nicknames  Than anybody else around here  Yeah  Sex Bagel  Sex Bagel, Hawk  That's a dumb one  I'm actually going to  Fly to San Francisco tomorrow  I'm a little nervous  I might to beat  That's where I'm going  There's a big cock festival  It's in Turkey  The cock festival  You blow somebody  With feathers in their pants  I might  My girlfriend's out there  I might take the helicopter  To Newark airport 
[02:15:00]  Because the traffic  Leaving Manhattan tomorrow  Crazy  You think it'll be bad?  Insanity  You can check in  At the helicopter thing  Just take the fucking helicopter  Please  Get in it  I've been discussing this  All morning  During every break  Don't worry about it  Have you ever heard  Of any crashes?  Well no  They just started  Okay  But you will eventually  And I'll never hear about it  If I'm on it when it happens  It's uh  How long is the flight?  10 minutes  It's 10 minutes 
[02:15:30]  10 minutes  What are the odds?  Things just gotta stay in the air  For 10 minutes  And you're fine  I've never been on a helicopter  Aww  I took a helicopter  Over the Grand Canyon  Doesn't get any worse than that  Because those things  Do fucking crash  Yeah  And there's a lot of them  That have crashed over the years  You barely hear about it  But over the years  Yeah  Well they're probably  Those things are probably  Planes too though  Run too  Like the helicopter  Grand Canyon  Probably getting used  Not like  Not like from New York  To Newark  Airport  That never happens  Yeah but there's probably  Better maintenance  You'll be fine  You'll come back 
[02:16:00]  With a great story  A great experience  You'll love it  And you'll never  Drive again to the airport  Oh my god  10 minutes  Yeah but you know  When you think  You might get a limo  Or something like that  It's probably comparable  We're gonna start  You know  I mean the cabs  Aren't cheap anymore  To go to an airport  So  No I never do that  I'm just worried  About leaving tomorrow  Oh it's gonna be  Heck on wheels  Pardon my French  Certainly will be  Fucking tomorrow  Starting at  Right about now  It's just  God awful  It's one of the worst  Traffic days of the year  The day before Thanksgiving  Yeah this is just gonna be 
[02:16:30]  No joke  No joke  It'll probably take you  Over an hour  Just to get out of Manhattan  But you gotta  Which is fine  The only problem is  But that's just to get  On the other side  And then you're gonna  Take the helix  All the way around  At about a mile an hour  I'm telling you  It's getting across town  Because this fucking  Heliport's not on the west side  It's on the east side  East 34th  Yeah  Which is annoying  Because then you gotta  Cross Manhattan town  Go by the fucking  Midtown tunnel  Which is bad too  I mean it won't be as bad  But crossing Manhattan  At that hour  Is gonna suck a big  It's crazy  That's gonna really 
[02:17:00]  Yeah that's gonna be  Really bad  That'll take longer  Than the flight to network  Absolutely  But they also have  One on Wall Street too  But getting downtown  Could be a motherfucker  Why don't you take  Why don't you take  A rowboat  Why can't the heliport  Be on the west side  They gotta heliport  Over there  But there's no  Newark flight thing  No  I don't think so  Fuckers  Why wouldn't they  Oh I don't know  Let's not be fresh  I guess they figure  That way  You don't have to go  Cross town traffic  If you're on the east side  Yeah  Then you fly across  Manhattan  And the river  And then you get to Newark 
[02:17:30]  Instead of having to  Drive across town  Yeah  To the west side  Alright listen  What do I know  What the fuck am I talking about  I'm pissed off  At the fucking garage  Let me just vent  At the garage  Because I know  I know  Jamaica Mike  Listens to this program  You gotta get your people  In line  I've mentioned  80 times  To these  People  Not to park my vehicle  Underneath the leaks  In the garage

[02:19:00]  They send me  I just get a fucking bill  What  I just get a monthly bill  From the cocksuckers  That they want their money  They want their fucking money  But they'll park my shit under there  Fuck you  I'm not paying  Fuck you  I'm not paying my fucking bill  Pay me  Until that's  Fuck you  Pay me  Pay me  Until that's taken care of  Damages  Punitive damages  You're giving me  Is there real damage though  That can't be fixed  I don't know  I'm gonna see  If there's some kind of chemical  That takes it off  Without fucking it up  But it always leaves

[02:25:00]  Yeah just shut up  Oh goody  The fact that Steve  Had a fucking length of time  In mind too  For two minutes  Two minutes  Should we play the  Should we try  Ode to Steve  Yes  Alright  And then we'll do  Ramone  The Aftermath  And then we'll do  Poe Radio  Steve Sensation  And maybe some other things  You never know  Here's the Ode to Steve  By Rashad  Face your hands  About just high  This song is dedicated  To the greatest bear  I've ever known  The lead singer of Foundry 
[02:25:30]  Just place your hands  About just high  The executive producer  Of the Opie and Anthony show  Just place your hands  The one  The only  Steve Carleesi  Superstar  I'd like to take a chance  If you couldn't believe  To stick up for my good buddy Steve  He gets a bad rap from O&A  Cause his act is bad  He says things kinda gay  But from man to executive producer  Ain't bad  And he lost a lot of weight  So be glad for the lad  He's still a big fella  A downright bear  But he don't like it 
[02:26:00]  So he lays his office hair  He got his ass kicked  By Tito Ortiz  He got a kick to get  By B-B-B-B-Ray Dudley  His site FoundryMusic.com  Is great  Even though it's still  A bitch to navigate  Moving on  Still he used to make  Renovations to his house  And when he rocked out  He wore a lame  Bryant blouse  He does voice work  For Rockstar Games  But it's hard to stick up  Over his good name  When he says stuff like  Cosme  Nothing good  Cosme  Cosme  Nothing good  Cosme 
[02:26:30]  Cosme  Nothing good  Cosme  Cosme  Cosme  Cosme  Cosme  He went to boys for years  And makes okay money  Got a gastric bypass  Old change  First time  And he cuts women  Hitting and abusive promos  And Orton makes them  When he talks to homos  Cos free trips to Vegas  For the AVNs  And that's it up  With German broads  Who snort  Seed men  Martini's always  Going down those pipes  Which is probably why 
[02:27:00]  He fell off that minibike  As his pendulum  Swings between  Hatero and queer  He'd like it  If he brought the  Flamin' Bear logo gear  He speaks for perfect diction  Used to be a bouncer  Has a bunch of tattoos  What else am I missing  He drives a hybrid  For good MPG  And wants to know  How to build parents  D.I.E.  He don't care for  His musical style  But has gangsta fag  On speed dial  Which might explain  His love for  Cosme  That's terrible 
[02:27:30]  I'm sorry  I liked it  I liked it too  Not bad  Yeah  Rashad  Good job  I don't know the genre  But it sounded cool  Rap  Well I know  I just don't know  Say that's some of that  What they call hip hop  Yeah that's what all  The young kids are  That's good  He knows a lot about the show  A lot of references in there  Good job Rashad

[02:35:30]  He hadn't done  This recently  This is kind of  Production  You're right  I meant Ramon  But yeah  It's a whole  Storyline  Right  It's based on  This rich  Eccentric  Voice over guy  Voice over talent  Talent  That does these  Deep voiced  Movie promotional spots  You know  The deep voiced  Guy  Small town  Right  And his  House boy  Named Ramon  And their 
[02:36:00]  Adventures together  Can I interrupt  For a second  Sure  Because CM Mark  Has a great one  From whack bag  Paul's foreplay  Is calling a negro  Over to service  His wife  Oh shit  Hey that's based  On a real story  Let that go  Sorry go ahead  And I didn't  Want that to go by  So yeah  And it's the  House boy  And the deep  Voice guys  Adventures together  Because apparently  They live in the  Same house  I don't know why  Steve's homoerotic 
[02:36:30]  Fucking fantasies  Of an older man  And his young  House boy  And I don't know  It always ends  With a weird  Little twist  Yeah  Where the guy  Needs a favor  From Ramon  And that's how  The Ramon  Calls got started  Now we listened  To part one  Already  Let's hear part one  But I need a recap  Alright let's do it  I have no idea  Where I left off  Ellen's dancing  Sorry guys  Oh look at her go  By the way  Everyone's dancing 
[02:37:00]  Like a bitch  Is chewing her box out  Oh sorry  Alright  Here's the Ramon  The brand new Ramon  And then we have  A part two to it  That hasn't been  Played yet  Here we go  I can't think  Of a better way  To start my day  Than with a bowl  Of broccoli  And some kashi  And I'll top it off  With a tall glass  Of metamucil  And a triple espresso  Ramon 
[02:37:30]  Fetch me a plastic cup  Oh no  See what it's  Gearing up for  Uh oh  That's right  Uh oh  It's gearing up  For the uh  Uh kind of  Like two girls  In a cup story  Uh oh  Oh no  You ready for uh  Part two  I am  Why are they laughing  Out there  I don't know  What happened 
[02:38:00]  Dan  I don't know  Are they  Loud  Are they doing  Their own radio show  That's the show  I would love to listen to  It sounds like fun  So much laughter  Why are you guys laughing  Cause um  I'll just  Play it  It has something to  With what we're  About to play  Well you yeah  You think you know  Where it's going  But it's  It's going somewhere else  Alright  It's called  Misdirection  That's right  Oh thank you  So much excrement 
[02:38:30]  This will never flush  Unless I break it apart  Ramon  Fetch me  Your toothbrush  What the fuck  Steve  What  Steve  So much excrement  What happened to the cup  There's so many  Unanswered questions 
[02:39:00]  Maybe the cup  Will come back  But there was really  It was  It was such a volume  Of excrement  That the cup  Just wasn't going to do it  So we had to move  The operation  To the bathroom  Where  Uh huh  Where there were just  Piles and piles  Of this stuff  Coming out of his  Lower intestine  Piles  Like a roast beef  Yeah  Like a roast beef  Like a pot roast  Yeah you really  You heard  You heard the water splashing  So there were just  Chunks of  Undigested meat  And  Only imagine  Yeah  It was just awful  So  You know 
[02:39:30]  He realized  That he was never  Going to get this stuff  Down the toilet  To begin with  So we had to  Break it apart  And you know  Of course  What better to do that  With than Ramon's toothbrush  I want my money back  I know  I was hoping  For a little more  Yeah  Well that's the great thing  About Ramon promos  We can always do more of them  We can always  Well you didn't sound as  Like  Ramon  Yeah  It wasn't really  I think you're losing  Your interest  No I'm not losing my interest  It's um  It's a trilogy  Maybe a quadrology  A quadrology 
[02:40:00]  Oh really  How about a septology  Or an octology  No what's the matter  You didn't know  Six or seven  Dirk was yelling  They all suck  About Steve's production  Was he really  Yeah  Oh you produce him  I think that's why  Everybody was laughing  Outside  Because he knew  That it's going to be  A letdown  Danny what happened  Oh nothing  I was just going to say  I just had a note here  I think that if I'm not mistaken  This is the fourth  Ramon promo  That has to do with duty  Yeah  Yeah usually 
[02:40:30]  They're very duty oriented  They are duty oriented  Because cleaning up  Cleaning up shit  Is disgusting  You're a one trick colon  Yeah thank you  Alright let's talk to  A helicopter pilot  For Jimmy  Oh  I think this is the  Company I used  Mike  Yes  I think I  I think I  I think I took a little  Tour with you guys  Did you  For my birth  Day last year  Good  You were on the  West side in the 40s  Yeah west side  And 30th  Hi  Yeah you guys got  The blue helicopters 
[02:41:00]  Right  Yeah we got a couple  That are blue  The pretty blue ones  This is Mike  From Liberty Helicopter  I believe  This is the one  We used to take a little  Tour for my birthday  It probably was  How you doing today  Hey man  You looking for a helicopter  Well I mean they  They have a thing  Where they're hooked up  With the TSA  So you go through  Security at the  Heliport  And then you go right  To the airport  In 10 minutes  Right  But it's only on the east side  But I'm nervous  About taking a helicopter  I've never flown in one  Could you take a  Could you get Jimmy  This is what Jimmy needs 
[02:41:30]  A helicopter from the west side  To the east side  Do you want a helicopter  From the west side  To the east side  And then go to another helicopter  No  I'll be all helicoptered out  That's crazy  I've never taken one dude  How safe are they  I know that sounds stupid  They're very safe  How high do they go  Do you think  Like to go to Newark Airport  We have to cross over  Lower Manhattan  How high do they go  Uh they fly  10-12 feet  Probably  Yeah about 1200 feet  1200  I was going to say  10-12 feet  Bounce more than that  That's scary  Do they bounce around  A lot in bad weather  Uh not really 
[02:42:00]  Yes they do  They're not too bad  In bad weather they do  Nah it's a quick flight  Over there  It's 10 minutes  It's an easy flight right  How many flights  Have you taken sir  Myself  Yeah  Hundreds  Do the planes run you over  When you're flying there  Never  I love Jimmy's  Infantile questions  He's serious though  He's a little worried  Do the planes run you over  They move out of our way  It scares me to get hit by a plane  Hold on I'm looking at the fucking preacher from Poltergeist 2 
[02:42:30]  Oh wait that's James Taylor  Jesus what happened to his lips  The only thing you have to worry about is  What we'll do is get you in  We'll copy your first flight  My boss Pat Day wants to copy the first flight for you  Oh thank you sir  But I can't take you guys  Only because I gotta go  I gotta take the US helicopter or whatever  Because  Oh boy  They have the security  They can land at Newark  Yeah  Yeah but maybe this guy  Could get you there a little easier  This guy is allowed to land at Newark  And then  We land at Newark all the time  Yeah  Yeah but I'll have to go through security  Yeah but that's  But so you still go through security 
[02:43:00]  But that's the time  The traffic's gonna kill you  So you gotta save an hour  Going across town  You take this  This is the easier  Helicopter flight  It's Liberty  They are really good  And then you wait in line for security  I think you're still ahead of the game  All you gotta worry about  Is catastrophic tail rotor failure  It's pretty much the only thing  That'll fuck you up  How long do you think security  Will be to check in  Probably about 40 minutes  To get through the line  What's that?  No I mean I'm asking these guys  40 minutes to get through the line  It'll probably be a lot of  Long line for security  Oh long long line 
[02:43:30]  But I'm going  I'm an elite member  So I get to go on  The first class line  Did you get your card yet?  Your um  What is that?  Clear or  No but it's no good  I have to  What?  No no hold on  You said it was good at Newark  It is but only Terminal B  It's not ready for Terminal C  Are you shitting me?  I wouldn't know  How come they said  It'd be good for Newark  And LaGuardia  And Kennedy  It will be  It's just not yet  And you have to go  And you have to get your card  In two weeks  I signed up online  And now I want to go  I have to get a retina scan 
[02:44:00]  Which I have not done  Can I get a retina scan?  Wow that's cool  How fucking futuristic is that?  I'm so annoyed at myself  For not having done this already  So Mike  Put Jimmy at ease  It's a safe flight right?  It's a very safe flight  There you go Jimmy  Thank you  It's a helicopter  Very safe  We've been around for over 20 years  We've got 14 helicopters in the fleet  And we're pretty much available  24 hours a day  Alright thanks very much  Do you use that thing  As just like a pussy machine sometimes?

Apparently  To heaven  I don't know how high were they  When they were  He was going to  He was going to a power line  The one thing about a helicopter 
[02:46:30]  Is you don't have to be high  To get really fucked up in it  If it crashes  Well they don't float down  Well you can auto gyro yourself down  Auto rotate  Auto rotate  What's that mean?  Have you been working on  Have you been working on your forearms?  It's when you  It's when you  You use the rotor  As you come down  You ever see like  One of those little  Leaves that you play with  Yes  And you let it go  And it goes down like a helicopter  You do that  But then at the last minute  You increase the pitch on the rotors 
[02:47:00]  And go  And it's supposed to slow you down  It takes a real perfect timing to do this  And then it slows you down  And you touch down  You know  Relatively gently  You can be  You know  You fuck your back up maybe  But it's very  Did you have to do that  To qualify?  Absolutely  Fuck  That's a tough move  You put it down in a tennis court  That's all you need  Really?  This has two pilots to fly it  That's a tough fucking move  Alright

Cause when you do  This morning radio  You gotta go to bed early  And she came in  To just say goodnight  As I was all situated  And figured I could  Let one loose  Oh no  And then she decided  To kinda  Get under the covers  Get under the covers  For a minute with me  She jumps out  And starts retching  Oh my god  To the point  I was so embarrassed  Dude why don't  You had to say 
[02:50:00]  Something beforehand  Go like  Don't come in here  I didn't think  She was coming in  And then all of a sudden  I pulled the blanket  Up to my eyes  I'm like oh god  Here it comes  Cause I know  It was just horrific  I was having horrific  Farts at the  Hockey game last night  And then she  Went under the covers  And just got a blast  And started retching  And it's the funniest thing  When she starts retching  And dry heaving  Over one of my farts  It's hilarious  It's hilarious  And I don't want  To do that  But it's really funny  To watch her suffer  It's so disgusting  I try not to do that

[02:51:00]  And wallop  Right in my face  Why are some farts  You let them go  In such a way  Like it feels like  You're filling up  A plastic bag  With warm air  Those are the  Soothing ones  Those are amazing  A disgusting conversation  But some  You just let go  There's no heat  You don't feel  Or smell anything  And then there's others  It's let loose  In such a way  You feel your underpants  Filling up with warm air  Those are the ones  Those are the  Mother is rubbing  My tummy farts  Like there's a lot of  Sour  And a piece of 
[02:51:30]  Curdled milk  On my lung  And mother rubs my tummy  And the milk gets  Pushed out  Via gas  Alright  We gotta take a break  You make your wee wee  And we'll do some  Poe audio next  From his actual radio show  Pat, I can't wait to hear  It's Opie and Anthony  O-N-A  Party rock  Party rock  Rock  Rock 
[02:52:00]  Rock  Rock  O-N-A  O-N-A  O-N-A  O-N-A  O-N-A  Oh-A-A!  Oh-A-80-A!  Oh-A-An-A-An-A!  Oh-A-A!  Oh-A-A! 
[02:52:30]  What are you형-  Every knee must bend.  bow. Every tongue  must confess. Thou art the  greatest, the greatest of all time.  Ella, Ella,  eh, eh. Yeah, we  sucked. Opie and Anthony, y'all. 
[02:53:00]  Opie and Anthony  on your... Point. XM Radio  Dahl. Master  Poe did a show on Saturday,  and it was, uh,  a show.  It was. It was very  controversial. Not the show, but what was  going on. Are you guys getting along today, Danny?  Um, there was a big fight  yesterday on the, uh, the Opie and Anthony  show. Danny versus Master Poe. 
[02:53:30]  I, I just, you know, went my  separate ways today. Haven't really... Acknowledged  him? No, not really. By the way,  uh, there's some creep that's been  watching us in the hall every single  day. Just the jerk off that works at the building.  Can we get Eric Logan or Don to explain what the fuck  is going on? Oh, is that, is that guy there to make sure  like we're good boys when we walk in? Yeah, I heard that  put a camera, probably because it's, I don't even think it's his  fault. I, uh... I think some of the faggots  on this floor have complained. Ooh.  And that's what it is. He's just answering complaints. He's not  the one complaining. He, uh, I, I was  walking by as he was going into a closet and 
[02:54:00]  I saw a TV and some kind of  recording device in this closet  right next to the, uh, the men's room. Yeah, let him watch.  And then as we were all... Next to the men's room?  Ooh. And as we were all getting... There's a camera in there.  I started going. I'm all sexy. And as we were all getting situated,  they were just kind of like lingering around  the, the freight elevator kind of watching  us as we all went into work. Let him!  That's really fucked up. You know what we  ought to do? We ought to fucking get off the elevator.  We ought to have a sheet with us.  So here's what you do. You have two guys get off and hold  up the sheet and then we get behind us and they just see  the big seat going down the hall. 
[02:54:30]  Let's fuck with them. Just don't do anything wrong.  That would be really fucking good. Let's just be obnoxious.  You want to be obnoxious, you fucking Mr.  Whipple-looking cunt fucking maintenance  man? Let's fuck with them. Except I'm just spent...  Let's wear old, oldie-time burglar  masks with a bag with  a dollar sign on it and  sneak past the camera. And how about your shirt  that say you're gay on the back of them?  Let's do it.  I like the burglar masks. Yeah, let's fuck  with them. XM spent about a million dollars on the  studio and it looks like the building's trying to get us  the fuck out of here, right? Fuck the building. 
[02:55:00]  What's up, Iraq? What's the building?  He starts standing downstairs watching what  audience we would have line up.  They can't even be in front of the building. They're off to  the side of another building. Now he starts  hanging on upstairs waiting for us to  come up here because they put the cameras in.  Let him! But he does it also for Ron and Fez and  I think Eddie Trunks should do too. Where are the cameras?  That I don't know. Because I was looking around  because when I saw the recording device in the  closet, I'm like, alright, where the fuck is the camera now?  You know where they are, then?  Maybe. Yeah, maybe. 
[02:55:30]  Are they hidden? Like, really?  Can we spray paint the lens?  I have a theory.  You don't wear? I'm not sure because we  have, we might have one out there too,  so I don't know. Oh, we do it. I know ours.  I don't want to blow up our spot.  Okay. Oh my god.  I know exactly what's up.  Alright, anyway, so Master Poe  and Danny went at it  and it was all about this radio show  he did Saturday with like 30 or 40 of his  closest friends. Close friends.  And a few convicts.  I was just watching one of those convicts videos  and thinking maybe the building guy could fix the cunt 
[02:56:00]  internet connection here because it's fucking terrible.  But I was just watching that 52 Blocks  guy, the guy they teach you to fight with cuffs  because they're all prisoners. Those guys are fucking  no joke, man. Fight with cuffs.  All elbows. Those guys are all  problems. Why are they called 52 Blocks?  I bet I don't know. Is that how many blocks there are  in their neighborhood?  Uh, yeah, that must be it.  Yeah.  You know what? That might be it.  I don't know.  No, it's got to be like Rikers 52  fucking cell block.  Cell block 52 or something.  Well, where's Poe? 
[02:56:30]  Can we have Poe in here?  I guess.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Where's the name 52 Blocks come from?  What is that, Poe?  It is 52 Blocks.  They have 52 Blocks within the system.  Cell Blocks?  No.  Blocking.  Oh, block as in blocking.  Deflections, yes.  Oh, okay.  Oh.  I was watching that guy's video.  That makes too much sense.  What's his name?  Light?  Light Burley.  Did I win?  Did you live on Prospect Street in Huntington? 
[02:57:00]  No, I never lived there.  Somebody I know does.  I'm trying to remember.  So Light Burley.  No, I never lived there.  Did you live on the 20 years?  Oh, maybe I shouldn't say good friend of mine is now living on Prospect Street in Huntington.  I'm such an asshole.  Oops.  Fucking stork.  Sorry for blowing up your spot.  I'm an idiot.  I thought it was you.  It must have been my brother.  He's lived at about 10 or 12 locations in Huntington.  All right, so Danny and Poe, you guys getting along? 
[02:57:30]  You're looking at each other?  You're shaking hands?  Are you us-ing each other?  What are you doing?  I will treat Poe like I would normally treat him on a daily basis.  You're us-ing each other.  Yeah, I'd like to move forward.  And I don't want to have any problems with Danny.  You didn't sleep last night, did you?  This was very traumatic for you.  No, I slept.  Did you sleep, Danny?  No, like a baby, actually.  Well, you shit yourself.  A little bit.  All right, here's the first clip from Poe's radio show. 
[02:58:00]  Poe's guest tells story of what made him want to get into martial arts, right?  What guest is that, Poe?  I'm trying to figure out which guest are we talking about.  It could be Grand Master Lentius.  Yes, it was him.  What?  Grand Master Lentius.  Oh, Lentius.  That guy, wow.  He looks pretty nasty.  Yes, he is.  Why was he in jail?  No, he wasn't in jail.  Oh, and this is from 1983?  How old is this guy?  Holy shit. 
[02:58:30]  Let me see.  Post guests were a little old, on the old side.  The film battle of the year.  Chuck Norris versus David Kung Fu Carradine.  This is off an official Karate magazine cover.  Interview with Joe Louis.  Okay, look.  Look, this is from 80.  Wow.  That would be Grand Master Lentius.  He is a legend within the Shotokan system.  Shotokan.  And what is that?  Shotokan is a Japanese art.  Japanese martial art. 
[02:59:00]  It's very hard blocks, hard kicks, hard punches.  I do the Shotokan.  Is he the white guy or the brother?  He's the guy that's hitting the other guy.  Yeah, it would be silly if you were on a magazine cover getting your ass kicked.  How old is he?  It's like, I made the cover.  Look, I'm getting punched.  Oh, no.  Oh, Pete.  Do you have a negative?  Is there a negative for that? 
[02:59:30]  No, that was given to me by Grand Master Lentius, oh, I'd say about 20 years ago.  Does Grand Master Lentius have another one?  I hope so.  Oh, Jesus.  I'm sure he does.  There was no need to do that.  It's okay.  It's radio.  No, look sick.  I know.  He's a good boy.  All right, here.  Let's play the clip.  You're not fucking crazy.  You didn't?  No.  Oh, my God.  You're still holding it.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez. 
[03:00:00]  All right, let's go.  Anyway, what happened was, going to school in the daytime, the white kids beat me up.  Coming home at night, the black kids beat me up.  So, one day, the white gang grabbed me outside, and with a makeshift meat hook, which is a nail  bent through a piece of wood, they hung me on a white picket fence.  Picket fence by my thumb, and with my own blood, they wrote the word Jew, so I wouldn't forget.  I haven't.  Jesus.  Well, I'm sorry that happened to you.  Hold on, you missed the bet. 
[03:00:30]  You missed.  Oh, he used?  Yeah, right.  Listen, us.  That's okay.  Wait, go back.  I got to hear it.  Listen again.  After this dramatic story, Poe's comment was, ush.  Ush.  Ush.  Ush.  Ush.  Ush.  Ush.  Ush.  By my thumb, and with my own blood, they wrote the word Jew, so I wouldn't forget.  I haven't.  Ush.  Well, I'm sorry that happened to you.  This is like an ush for all occasions.  Yes, it is.  Ush.  It's like good to see you.  Ush.  Ush.  It's kind of like the Brady Bunch theme. 
[03:01:00]  There's many different versions.  Ush.  You're going to comment, ush.  Grandmaster Lynch actually explains.  He has his own description of what ush means.  Yes, that'll all be coming up later in the clips.  Oh, okay.  Because it's a mystery to all of us.  What, how to use ush.  Let's keep it that way.  Travis suggested that Poe uses ush like the way Tim Allen grunts on Home Improvement.  I was under the impression, seeing Poe use the word ush, that it was a greeting that 
[03:01:30]  perhaps people familiar with martial arts use for each other.  So, because walking down the sidewalk, I'll see like the doorman at the hotel up there  will go, ush.  And maybe a garbage man on the side of the road, ush.  They all know Poe as he takes the Mayor Poe walk up 57th and everybody's ush.  But I didn't know you could just go like, you know, somber, like the Jewish story there  with the blood and the ush. 
[03:02:00]  I didn't know you could just, oh, ush, man, ush.  Well, Greg Brady's Leftovers from Wisconsin writes, I miss Grandmaster Lunch, so I'm really  looking forward to Grandmaster Supper.  I can says ush.  It's for any occasion.  Moving on with the Master Poe radio show where he talks about everything is a weapon in this  clip or somebody does.  Well, when you walk through a supermarket, a hardware store, anywhere you go, everything 
[03:02:30]  is a weapon.  Everything.  And people don't understand that.  They don't understand that.  If you're walking down the street and a gang is coming down the other way and you know they're  coming after you, you're not going to be, you know, Kung Fu Louie or somebody trying to  knock them out.  The best thing to do is pick up a garbage can or a brick, throw it through a supermarket  window.  Because if you yell help or fire, nobody's going to come.  Throw a brick through a window.  The manager and all the employees will run out in that street and they'll be gone. 
[03:03:00]  What if it's three in the morning?  Oh, ush.  Oh, ush.  So that's an acknowledgement of like, I agree.  I hear you.  So the first, is that like, uh, I know what, you know what I'm saying?  That's exactly what it is.  And it's giving respect.  If you don't say anything, you're not respecting your idea.  Did anyone ever get a grandmaster lunch, some water for his drive, his dry mouth?  His grandmaster, what's his name?  Lenches.  He talks like the old Indian from natural born killers. 
[03:03:30]  He's got that old, he's got a little Jimmy super fly in him too.  That's who he is.  Yeah, there's a lot of Jimmy super fly.  That's who it is.  And his other guest, uh, coincidentally sounds exactly like somebody else as well.  Okay.  Yeah.  How old is this gentleman?  Uh, he's about 70, 72 I think.  Could he still handle himself?  Oh, yes.  Yeah, I wouldn't fuck this guy.  Is he still a problem?  Us.  Not here, but he can.  No, no, but I mean, if someone came at him for fisticuffs.  He'll rip him apart.  Okay?  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Come on. 
[03:04:00]  Us.  Us, Jim.  Us.  Us?  Do you hear people saying us?  Who's?  Poe compares...  Us!  Whoa!  Poe compares karate to comedy, huh?  Oh, no.  Oh, that's interesting.  Oh.  A little, uh, juxtaposition.  We finally get to hear Master Poe on his own radio show.  Let's hear it.  Instead of horses.  Opie and Anthony, Jim Norton, these are the guys that I'm with every day, and they're amazing.  Uh, I gotta give props to these guys.  Nice.  Because there's a similarity here that I'm gonna talk to you about.  Um, comedians, when you attack them with a joke, and I'm not a comedian, I can never 
[03:04:30]  do what they do, but I give them the biggest us ever.  Because when you attack them with a joke, they come right back at you.  I mean, they hit you hard.  And no matter what happens, you can come back again.  They're gonna hit you again.  They're gonna come back.  And it's just like, like a ping pong, and they never stop.  That's what makes a great comedian.  Absolutely.  Us.  Us.  Now I'm gonna say us. 
[03:05:00]  And we want the biggest us ever, like you said in that clip.  Let's hear it.  Us.  Whoa.  Us.  That's pretty big.  No, this is even bigger.  I just pictured a giant us.  Like this huge us.  Like a cloud.  Yeah.  It's giant.  This is bigger.  Us squared.  I have us times eight.  Wow.  Us.  Us.  I like your us.  Alan Alda us. 
[03:05:30]  Sam.  Sam, we gotta us.  We gotta us, Sam.  Uh-oh.  It was blood.  Yeah.  I'm gonna give you the biggest us ever.  That's right.  You take this us.  Us.  So you think you're gonna emerge victorious in the Rage in a Cage?  Us.  That's right.  You take my us. 
[03:06:00]  No chance at hell.  You cannot get a bigger us than I'm gonna give you right now.  Us.  And you're teamed up with Grandmaster Lutz.  You think you can be Grandmaster Lutz?  Us.  Oh, my God.  It's all right.  I don't have to sing for a while.  I can do angry, Vince.  You want me?  It's those weeks I gotta sing. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, it ain't happening.  It ain't happening this week.  Hey, Dave B. from Philly writes, Jim Norton makes people laugh and Poe stabs people in  the chest with his thumb.  It's so similar, it's scary.  I'm scared of that helicopter.  Us.  Us.  All right.  We go on to Grandmaster Banks.  He shoots down the UFC.  That's a little crazy there, Poe.  That's a little crazy.  Let's talk about truth, man.  Let's really bring it out.  And I'm glad that you're doing it.  Stop the clip, please. 
[03:07:00]  Grandmaster Banks, we need a little background.  Is he a convict?  No, no.  Great Grandmaster Banks is one of the leading authority in promotion of martial arts tournaments,  World Martial Arts Hall of Fames.  How old is he?  He's 80.  Wow.  Is he still fighting?  Can he still fight?  No.  If you...  I mean, not professionally, but I mean like if someone gave him a problem.  No, if you cough, you may fall down.  Oh, really?  He's an old man. 
[03:07:30]  He's 80 years old.  And he coincidentally sounds exactly like Brooks from the Shawshank Redemption.  But the other guy could still take care of himself.  I might just shoot him.  I got a job at the foodway.  The foodway.  Did you ask him about Rapper's Delight?  Uh, no.  So Grandmaster Lange can take care of himself, but this guy is probably a little bit too fast.  Grandmaster Banks.  Thanks is super.  Great Grandmaster Banks.  He, um...  So when did you get into talking about, like, uh, the roots of rap? 
[03:08:00]  We didn't discuss rap.  Why is it Grandmaster wanting Great Grandmaster for the other?  Well, that's his title, and out of respect, that's what we give him.  Oh, us.  They both tend to host to everybody.  Four different conversations going on.  Oh, I know.  Enjoy your favorite.  Just pick one and go with it.  And just go with it.  That would be the easiest way to enjoy a radio show.  I'm trying to get a Grandmaster Flash joke together.  Those guys are on their own fucking show.  And Jimmy's asking real questions. 
[03:08:30]  And Jimmy's asking real questions.  Joke that Danny just said.  Oh, is that what you were doing?  I didn't even know that.  You kept saying that.  And Jim's carrying on.  We had three conversations going on.  I'm like, I think I could get this Grandmaster Flash thing going if someone would pay attention.  Jimmy's asking normal questions.  Ant and Danny are having their own fucking thing.  And you're just firing out pre-1980 rap lines.  Let's talk to Dawny, who was not safe last Saturday.  I don't care what anyone says.  Dawny, I apologize that you had to hang out with convicts. 
[03:09:00]  It was pretty scary, but we managed.  All right.  Us.  Us, Dawn.  Us.  Us.  Us.  We were on the elevator leaving that night.  And the Grandmaster gets on a packed elevator.  And he turns to one of his entourage.  And farts.  He's got him up there and goes, was that a radio show?  No way.  He didn't know where he was.  Was that a radio show?  Us.  He didn't know if it was radio or TV or what. 
[03:09:30]  Us.  Us.  Us.  Us.  Wow.  Let me ask you a question.  There's 52 blocks, Poe, you had those guys on.  There's two of those guys?  Yes.  Now, did they feel, because the whole thing was between Poe and Danny, you thought that  he had been disrespectful in front of your guests.  But none of your guests have called in to say that he was or wasn't.  Well, it seems like they're not going to call in.  Why?  And I don't know, and that's okay.  But what I'd like to say for the record is, I think we both got out of hand. 
[03:10:00]  And in regards to the letter, I was angry at the time.  Well, that's what the record is.  Like I said, I was angry at the time.  See you, Grandma's, for Thanksgiving, Donnie.  Oh, see you, Thanksgiving.  Bye, Donnie.  Us.  Us.  So why won't we then call in to discuss?  I would plug that guy in in a second, because I want a copy of his DVD.  Oh, yeah.  All right, let's go to Scooter in Illinois.  Scooter's got time.  Scooter.  Scooter.  Hey, Scooter.  Concrete walker.  Concrete city people. 
[03:10:30]  Can we get a city people prank call?  Why don't you go put shoes on and walk around on the concrete?  You got to get the original.  What is it?  What is it called?  Terrorist telemarketers?  What prank call tape was that from?  It's hilarious.  We'll find it.  That guy's voice was hilarious.  Touchtone terrorist, right.  Scooter, what's up?  Get a good Scooter call.  What are the originals?  Huh?  Picture your grandmaster naked. 
[03:11:00]  Linger, linger.  Hey, Paul, how come one of those guys won't call in?  Like the 52 Blocks guy?  I would love to hear from one of those guys.  No, no, no, no.  They don't have XM.  They're not listening to the show right now.  Tell them to steal one.  Their prepaid cards ran out.  Well, you could call them, couldn't you?  Sure, I could call them.  All right.  Why the dramatic monotone?  My throat hurts.  My throat hurts.  From usin'?  Too much us?  No.  Sometimes he does these us's.  You'd think it was too little people.  The doctor's going to tell him to not us for a week. 
[03:11:30]  Yes.  All right.  Let's meet Grandmaster Banks.  He shoots down the UFC.  A lot of fans of the UFC.  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Let's see what Grandmaster Banks has to say about that.  Let's talk about truth, man.  Let's really bring it out.  And I'm glad that you're doing it.  And I love you for that, Robert Rivera.  You're going to eat that?  Master Poe.  Because this is what it's all about.  Okay.  I don't want to take up too much time here, you know, talking about it.  But somebody's got to say something about it. 
[03:12:00]  Especially with the garbage that you see on television with this ultimate challenge thing and all that.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, it is a joke.  It is.  Because it's not real martial arts.  They call it martial arts.  But it is not martial arts.  It's what I call DF.  It's called degenerate fighting.  I saw an automobile once when I was a kid.  But now they're everywhere.  It seems things are just getting a little faster. 
[03:12:30]  I hear a lot of different people in that voice.  The way UFC fighting is good fighting, man.  Oh, absolutely.  Listen, I wasn't agreeing with him in regards to that.  Because personally, the UFC or Valley Tudo, these guys are in incredible shape.  And they fight very, very hard.  You tell me a guy like Mirko Krokop or fucking Fedor couldn't beat a traditional martial.  Of course they are.  I mean, those guys are bad motherfuckers, man.  Us. 
[03:13:00]  Us.  That's not my argument.  Our argument, Grandmaster Lentius and I, is if you take the mixed martial arts and you go out into the street and you go down to the ground, that's dangerous.  That's one of our arguments.  As far as great Grandmaster Aaron Banks, I'm really not sure because he has to...  Well, you're saying that it's dangerous in a good way.  Like, it's a dangerous thing.  Us.  Us.  Jimmy.  Us.  Us.  Good us right there.  Us.  Are you saying it's a good thing?  Us.  No, no.  To go down to the ground is not good. 
[03:13:30]  Us to your us.  It's dangerous.  And I don't want to get your us.  Damn it.  Us, mate.  But what if someone gets you down?  What's that?  What if someone gets you down?  Us.  If someone gets you down, it's good to have that knowledge, right?  Well, if someone gets you down, absolutely.  You need to have that knowledge.  And most definitely these guys are...  Jimmy, I want to acknowledge your us and raise you an us.  Okay.  And another us.  You know what?  I've decided to go all in on my us again.  No, man.  Damn it.  I was bluffing.  I see your us.  Take it down.  I see your us and I raise you a he-ya. 
[03:14:00]  After this round, let's raise the usses.  I'm going to throw in a us and I'm going to raise you a word.  Damn.  But one of the things that we were discussing is...  Your mother, would that work better?  Yeah, I think so.  All right.  Well, if you do go down to the ground, you can have like four or five guys or ten guys  or fifteen guys waiting on the side.  And once you're on the ground, they're going to kick you in the head.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And, you know...  And you can get gum on yourself.  And you can get gum on yourself. 
[03:14:30]  Us.  Us.  Us.  Just...  Us.  Us.  Don't be us.  I'm an asshole.  I'm an asshole.  You might be us-ing.  Yeah, yeah, it smells like us.  You've got to wipe your us.  Us hole.  What an us. 
[03:15:00]  All right, hey.  So, why don't we...  So, this next clip is a fan calling.  What's this about, Danny?  There seems to be...  There seems to be something going on here because it's fan in quotes.  Well, yeah, you know...  When you put this together, Danny...  The, uh...  Poe had a lot of callers calling into his show.  And Poe was excited that he had a lot of callers.  So, he was anxious to get to a bunch of them.  So, I think this...  This clip, there's two phone callers back-to-back.  I think it's the first two, actually.  All right, let's listen to some fans calling into the master...  How do you have fans ready? 
[03:15:30]  Well, people were ready to listen.  They're your fans.  They're not mine.  They're fans of the Saturday programming, no matter what song.  No matter what crap we throw at them.  They love listening.  I'm amazed they're still listening to that.  So am I.  Now, most of it's good.  Most of it.  We have a caller.  His name is Chad.  Chad, are you there?  Hey, Chad.  Ouss.  Ouss.  I like that.  This is cool. 
[03:16:00]  Hey, Chad, what's going on?  Oh, what happened?  You disappeared.  You gave me an ouss and you disappeared?  What happened?  You know what?  A softer ouss.  I think I'll give him a softer ouss.  Okay, let me have Jay.  Hey, Jay, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, Paul?  How are you, bro?  I'm doing fine.  I was just wondering.  You were saying, what's more martial art?  Would you say Rampage Jackson versus Liddell is a bigger martial arts spectacle? 
[03:16:30]  Or are you versus a blonde at FH Riley?  That's interesting.  Okay, next caller.  Okay, next caller.  Prank caller, prank caller.  Hang on.  Hang on.  Prank caller, prank caller.  That was a good one.  No, it was fun.  Oh, man.  Fuck, man.  Wow.  And your martial arts friends are probably like, what the fuck is this guy talking about?  That's exactly what they said.  You should have said you fought a blonde guy.  You should have just went with it.  400 blocks of New York Avenue. 
[03:17:00]  I tried.  All right, here we go.  Now we got a third fan call.  Yeah, this is another.  Smart us.  All right, here we go.  Let me have Ryan.  Ryan.  Yes.  What's going on, Ryan?  Us.  Us. 
[03:17:30]  That's cool.  The calling, giving me an us, and hanging up.  But at least you're handling it well.  I don't know you.  Who is this?  I'm coming here.  I'm hanging up the phone.  Prank caller, prank caller.  Wow.  Okay, we're back live.  A lot of us going on there, Poe, I noticed.  And I guess this is a perfect clip to play now.  You finally explain what us means to you.  You, Master Poe.  Us.  Are you an actual master? 
[03:18:00]  I was given a master, yes.  Master's level.  I've been training since 1967.  67?  Wow.  Five.  Five years old.  Yeah.  Us.  On the playground.  This baby needs to make an us.  I was ushing when you were banging cheerleaders.  Mike, you don't come to us. 
[03:18:30]  And ushing a man like no green like that.  Three years old, the usses.  Drudge hits for everybody here.  The dancers will kick your wrists out.  The dancers will us your tongue out.  Marlon Brando's ushing with oranges in his mouth.  Stop, you're ushing it.  She was very badly used, you see? 
[03:19:00]  Your son is attempting to break.  Outside us, aren't?  An us.  Wait, what's wrong?  What's wrong, Poe?  What's wrong?  Case in point.  What do you mean case in point?  You guys just...  No, that's amazing.  I mean, you guys are like two fighters.  They fight.  They keep on fighting.  They keep on going at each other until someone goes down.  Give me a Diablo sandwich and an usse and make it fast.  I'm going to cut it in for it. 
[03:19:30]  Sheriff.  My hat's off to you guys.  Us.  Alright, here we go.  You like ushing, Doc?  That was a good, good us, Wade.  That's a pretty sweet us.  Yeah, I fucked up with that one.  Alright, Poe describes the...  Not too sure I agree with your us there, Lou. 
[03:20:00]  Poe describes the us in this clip.  Us.  Oh, Sensei.  Yeah.  Please, give us your definition of us.  That's Grand Master Lynch's.  Yeah.  To me, because martial arts is my life.  It's everything I am.  I can't live without it.  And the thing about us is a samurai's code.  It's a way of the warrior.  When I see somebody and I respect them, I bow to them and they bow to me.  No matter how big we are, no matter what race, religion, or where we come from. 
[03:20:30]  And anywhere I've been in the world, I will see somebody with a martial arts gi bag and  I'll say to them, us, and they will bow and say, us, and I feel I'm home.  This is family.  That's what it means to me.  It's chivalry.  It's valor.  It's knights of the round table.  I like that.  Us.  I like that.  Us.  That was fantastic.  I got the chills when you said all that.  Son of I.  Getting the chills.  The douche.  Yes, sir.  It's cold.

[03:28:00]  okay gentlemen  we're going to take  a little break  I hope we're enjoying  ourselves  I know I am  I know  Jesus  real party happy  it's a new year's eve  just got some awful  news  that's what that  sounds like  I can't  yeah tragic  you're very somber  yes you are  I want to hear the  52 blocks guys  I understand the  subject matter  Jimmy it's fun  you should say that  the next clip is  the convict  oh cool  what's his name  Gans 
[03:28:30]  well you have  convict  well I'll tell you  what Billy Bear  light burly  Billy Bear  he's Gans  to pull a gun  on a bus  that's who  that's who  that's who  pull a gun  fucking Billy Bear  and Gans  nice gun  yeah  can't believe it  I got  light burly  and Raj  what is his name  Raj  and there's the guy  that  this is the guy  this is the convict  you found on the internet 
[03:29:00]  right  hey hey hey  for the radio show  light burly is the one  that I found on the  on the internet  he's the student of  and it's uh  he talks about 52 blocks  and the kind of people  involved with it  oh Raj is the master of it  uh yes  alright  let's listen to the convict  the only thing  that blew me away  I'm gonna tell you  straight up  and I stopped  okay  is that he caught  fists  and then he kissed him  ah  okay  I'm sorry  that like threw me  I was like  done  yes  yes 
[03:29:30]  well  that punch  was made famous  by one of the most  prominent and well known  52 fighters  mother dare  now the  the stigma attached  to mother dare  was you know  that he  he did things  as far as like  sexually on his own  which was  he was gay  and uh  he had a way of  um  using the 52  knocking you out  and then he would  molest you  because of that  he didn't have  one of the best  reputations  but he did have  a serious  reputation  of being able 
[03:30:00]  to catch punches  block punches  and return  with like  counter strikes  that would  devastate  and then  usually ending up  the knockouts  so uh  he made that  catch and kiss  very famous  that's great  wow  and us right  to the ass  he fucking  knocks you out  and then fucks  you  wow  that's a fucking  i mean he was  feared in jail though  now i don't tangle  with him  because you might  you might catch  her on the chin  and then catch  another on the chin  how about we leave  that guy home  next time you do 
[03:30:30]  a radio show  uh  i like the convicts  they probably have  better stories  they guys have  regular fighting stories  how many  you could talk  to chuck norris  for a week  and he won't  tell you  that he knows  someone who  rapes people  once he knocks  them out  that guy rules  wow  how did i just  stop the show  how did i ruin  everything  just trying to  have fun  i'll tell you  why  i'll tell you  why because i  think we all  were just thinking  of what you  just said  getting knocked  out and then  fucked in the  us is not  something any  of us want  to think about 
[03:31:00]  too long  well that guy  is no longer  in jail  he's dead  who is  oh the gay  guy  yeah  he died  no he died  they took care  of him  oh he got  killed  i fucked  the wrong  guy  he hurt  too many  people  oh he  died of  a bad  us  got the  us  in the  yard  what was  he in  jail  for  oh i have  no idea  i don't know  anything about  him  what was he  in jail  for  punching  people and  fucking them  in the ass  probably  that was  how he was  on good  behavior  he did  worse shit  on the  outside  traffic violation 
[03:31:30]  unpaid  parking tickets  and he gets  in there  and starts  fucking  everybody  with his  fucking  elbow  and rapes  them  that would  be fucking  insane  he was  a lawyer  with a  speedy  ticket  he never  paid  let's  say hi  to fan  in quotes  number four  to post show  alright let's  listen to this  let me have  master stone  master stone  oh master stone  good evening gentlemen  i'm sorry  master stone  two quick things 
[03:32:00]  i really look up  to what you're  doing here  po  i really appreciate  that you come  out here  and talk to us  about martial arts  i also study  martial arts  just like you  us  not you  frankus  frankus  they're part of  the o and a  cube  it's okay  it's all good  it's like an  us  frankus is like  when they say  frankus it's like  saying us  wait a minute  really  frankus 
[03:32:30]  not at all  frankus  you're just like us  us  that's what he's  trying to say  with this show  that's great  all right and  finally poe talks  about road rage  all right  everyone has  this idea of  pushing out their  ego and wearing  an s on their  shirt  you know we  should all try  to handle a  situation with  respect if you  were brought up  with respect and  you have the  power of the  mind you have  the the ability  to foresee what  can happen you  have no idea if  that guy has a 
[03:33:00]  gun in his  pocket if he  has a knife in  his pocket or  if he has a  gang of 50  guys waiting in  his in his  volswagon which  that's not  going to happen  but what i'm  saying is that  you know there's  no reason for  us to approach  the circus poe  50 guys in a  volswagon  you have no idea  if he has a  bearded lady or  a bear on a  bicycle riding  in a circle  you don't know  if he has uh  uh the world's  fattest woman  or fucking a  penis in a  jar of  ass  almighty that's 
[03:33:30]  the worst  example 50  guys in his  volswagon  couldn't he  be a bus  driver  yeah let's  go back to  this  what i'm  saying is  that you  know there's  no reason for  us to approach  people first of  all don't ever  approach anyone  you don't stay in  in arms distance  you stay at  least five to  ten feet away  from someone  okay you gotta  understand something  that it is so  scary out there  and if someone  cuts you off  hey no big 
[03:34:00]  deal all right  roll down the  window all  right buddy  have a nice  day okay all  good i'm glad  you're in a rush  to go somewhere  but there's no  reason to get  out of the car  and take a bat  to these guys  there's no reason  at all  how do you find  yourself that  patience to deal  with that though  see that's the  thing you train in  the martial arts  and it gives you  that patience  because you learn  a discipline with  the respect that  you have of your  instructors and your  masters and your  grandmasters they 
[03:34:30]  give you the  patience they give  you the patience  because you you  bleed you sweat  and you you  suffer and you  work very very  hard to gain the  skills that you  need and it  doesn't it's not  overnight man it's  not overnight okay  and and you have  to understand that  patience will come  it takes time  it takes patience  yeah us us us  us indeed all right  hey buddy have a  nice day glad to 
[03:35:00]  see you're in a big  hurry I think uh  that was good  acting I thought  you were really in  a car I said how  to poke an audio  of myself in a car  that was in the  studio I was just  interested that that  would be your advice  to somebody who cut  somebody off was to  roll down the window  and be verbally  passive aggressive with  them instead of  taking instead of  taking a bat to their  face is there anyone  we can hear that  just just I just  like pose acting on  that one line where  he goes hey buddy  he's he's on he's  thinking hey goes  along yeah I'd like  to see you're in a 
[03:35:30]  hurry hope you use  regular on that  hey don't hit the  tolls without easy  pass  you got that  cut you off hey  no big deal all  right roll down the  window all right  buddy have a nice  day okay all good  I'm glad you're in  a rush to go  somewhere but there's  no reason to get  I hope you don't  find a good parking  spot hey buddy hey 
[03:36:00]  hey use the blinker  yeah hey friend get a  boat about the worst  things you can possibly  say to somebody my  mother's a cunt has  more dignity than  fucking hey buddy here's  your hat what you  hurry I'd rather yell  out the window pull  out your cock and I'll  suck it fella hey  friend hey there are  no strangers only  friends we haven't met 
[03:36:30]  yet slow down buy gas  this is the worst  improv I've ever heard  here's the last track  post-show ending this is  how it ended  oh boy  that was well it was  quiet  one second sir  one second sir I have  to say because I know  if I if I give me one  second sir masterpo at  masterpo.com send me in  your letters I want to  know everything about  you  but then the actual 
[03:37:00]  beauty of that was  Eric kept telling him  in his talkback that we  bought him five more  minutes so after the  show was over and I'd  put my jacket on and  left he decided to do a  radio show for another  six and a half minutes  holy shit he wasn't  listening to the time  cue so he switched his  headphones to program so  he couldn't hear anything  we were doing show ends  and he just kept going  yeah I thought the  show because he told me  I had more time and I 
[03:37:30]  talked about this when  the audience was getting  ready and leaving I  don't know I didn't I  don't know about anyone  else but I have got to  listen to an arena show  I think oh yeah I think  we'll just burn your  copy that one I think  we'll give you another  show as long as you  invite a lot of convicts  in next time I think  it should be a second  arena show if Paul would  do us thank you  so why don't you  you guys like man hug  or something now  no I don't think  that's I think you're 
[03:38:00]  going to be seeing  that kind of us  thing I'll tell you  what that's just us  dude  hold on I got to get  something out of my  oh my god damn  nah yeah  I'm turtling  you almost  bust yourself  oh you fucking  dude another worse  than when the log  pokes out like it's  some fucking  I'm laughing  hey it's 
[03:38:30]  Ruth Buzzy  after a fire  Goldie Log  alright give me  alright you learned  to press  you jumped on that  one too  you can almost see  your log's little  hands holding the  thing going hello  and then it goes back  in behind the  colon  line of the day  brought to you by  BodogFantasy.net  thank you Paul  free live scoring  stats bios and news  that will help you  win big this season  in fantasy football  they're whispering  all good  yeah

[03:39:30]  who wrote a letter  to you know  to try to get me  in some trouble  so it would be  kind of hypocritical  to do that  I have to say  that goes against  the whole martial arts  thing I think  with the codes  and the respect  and all that  at the time  I was angry  and that's something  that's  you don't just go  hey fella  I'm writing a letter  hey pal  I just  I couldn't  I just couldn't  go home happy  with myself  if I shook  your hand  about it  wait a minute  you guys gotta  you gotta get  Paul Brick  on this one thing 
[03:40:00]  you're putting him  in a world  which is corporate  and you want him  to be a gentleman  and not react  the way he reacts  which is through  savagery  the way he would  normally have handled  that is a fucking  abiding  I mean  I understand  I get it Jim  but if it was like  if it was like  a one time deal  like that would be fine  but I mean  you know  not for nothing  but this is like  at least the third time  I can count  so  third time  I just can't  I've blown up on you  no that you've had  to write letters  to bosses  I mean that's  I'm not about  to get into  another screaming match  it's just my personal opinion  I think it's unnecessary 
[03:40:30]  let's keep this  as a cliffhanger  no handshake  that's fine  no handshake  but you can rip  his throat out  if you like  no more  yeah no more  corporate nonsense  it's gonna bust  your guitar hero hand  that's what I'll do  oh I just  I got Rockman  waiting for me  alright  I'll do it the way  I know how  us  oh  he us'd  you giving us back  that's better than  the shake  us  why don't you just  present your us  everyone present  everyone show their us  us
