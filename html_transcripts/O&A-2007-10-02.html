<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with discussions surrounding Britney Spears' custody battle and the $10 million sexual harassment lawsuit against Isaiah Thomas.  The hosts, using misogynistic and homophobic slurs, offered crude commentary on both topics, speculating on Spears' mental state and expressing cynical views on the ease of filing lawsuits.  Numerous listener calls followed, recounting personal experiences with workplace harassment, often highlighting perceived double standards based on gender. The hosts analyzed a sexist 1943 guide on hiring women, further fueling their commentary on gender dynamics and societal norms.  A recurring segment, "Homo Culture," ironically addressed a perceived shift towards more male nudity in advertising and media, prompting further discussion about societal changes and their views on lawyers, particularly female ones.  Throughout the broadcast,  the "80s New Wave Tuesday" segment played songs, with listeners guessing the artists. E-Rock participated in this segment, occasionally reading definitions.

The show continued with a discussion on the hosts' derisive view of "man dates" and "mancations," criticizing them as "fruity." They also heavily criticized a negative review of a Geico cavemen-themed TV show before seeing it. Another listener call detailed a brother's close male friendship, leading to more discussion about male bonding and evolving terminology. The 1943 hiring guide was revisited, sparking more crude humor about gender roles.  A "Hidden Danger News Tease" segment followed, mocking the sensationalization of minor risks by news outlets.  This led to tangents about potato salad consumption and personal anecdotes.

The "80s New Wave Tuesday" segment continued, this time featuring Club Soda Kenny, Roland, and Steve's poorly sung renditions of 80s songs, along with a discussion of Peter Schilling ("Major Tom") and Ken Burns's World War II documentary. A "Guess the Sound" segment was teased.  A new segment, "What the F?", debuted, focusing on random observations and questions, ranging from artificial food flavorings to the redundancy of spelling out phone numbers in commercials, with heavy profanity and vulgarity.

"E-Rocktober," a recurring bit mocking E-Rock, followed. The hosts speculated about his mental state and discussed offensive content from his old website, prompting more vulgar commentary.  They announced the "What the F?" segment would continue the next day.  Technical difficulties with the new studio's microphones ensued, leading to humorous banter about faulty equipment.  This led to an in-studio conversation with Dan Natterman and a phone call with "Stalker Patty," who was outside the studio. The conversation included Patty's personal life, virginity, and physical appearance, along with crude humor about farts and bodily functions, moving into discussions about strip clubs and sexual topics with heavy profanity and sexual innuendo.

A discussion about body image and aging, prompted by comments on a female guest’s physique, devolved into a sexually charged interaction, culminating in Stalker Patty performing a pole dance in her underwear. The hosts made numerous sexually suggestive comments.  An interview with "Big A," a Bronx taxi driver with a speech impediment, followed.  The interview focused on his short-lived marriage, with the hosts repeatedly pressing him for details suggesting it was potentially an arranged marriage for financial gain.  Numerous sexually explicit jokes and comments were made, speculating on the nature of his relationship and his wife’s potential involvement with other men.  Sponsors mentioned throughout the broadcast included BodogFantasy.net, AdamandEve.com, GoToMyPC.com, and Gamefly.  Dan Natterman promoted his website. The show concluded with ongoing technical issues.

A further segment featured Dan Natterman recounting sexually explicit anecdotes about his honeymoon.  Opie, Anthony, Ron, and Fez engaged in sexually charged banter, creating numerous crude jokes and sexual innuendo, frequently referencing anal sex. A bizarre escalating series of events involving Natterman, East Side Dave, and Earl, focused on increasingly uncomfortable and explicit physical interactions, culminating in Earl spitting on Dave's penis. The show covered cold sores, bodily fluids, and other sexually suggestive topics.  The "Line of the Day" segment was also featured, with humorous and often crude listener submissions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of radio shock jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good.  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Infamous DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio host, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks, Opie and Anthony.  What happened to you?  I put a .380 in my chest and a full trigger.  Hey, how did help show up for you?  The question is, why did help show up for you?  This is where entertainment is going.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  They are sick freaks. 
[00:01:00]  So you're kind of like transvestite or transsexual, sorry.  On your underwear, do you have a sign that says pardon our appearance for remodeling?  This is the worst show I've ever been on.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[00:01:30]  Wakey, wakey. 
[00:02:00]  Wakey, wakey.  Wakey, wakey.  Wakey, wakey.  Ah, good morning.  Hi.  Ah, good morning. 
[00:02:30]  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  Brittany has lost her kids.  How long before she just puts one in her face?  That's the next step.  Yeah.  They were talking about on Larry King last night.  And now they're worried about her.  They're now worried about her harming herself now. 
[00:03:00]  Because she's done everything else.  Who is Larry talking to?  Dr. Drew?  Dr. Drew Pinsky.  What does he know, really?  You can't be like a sexpert if your last name is Pinsky.  Pinsky.  He's supposed to be a shrink, but he's on the radio all the time.  Does he actually see patients?  Do people walk into an office and sit down and go, hey, you're Drew Pinsky. 
[00:03:30]  I think during commercial breaks, he lays people down on a couch and analyzes them.  Runs out of the radio studio and he does his thing.  Dr. Pinsky.  Drew Pinsky.  I love the experts at things that are on the radio.  Because radio is kind of a full-time thing.  Yeah.  You know, your life kind of revolves around it.  How do you have time to be an expert at what you're doing?  And keep up to date with all the latest stuff in psychiatry and psychology.  You know, perhaps he's out of touch. 
[00:04:00]  You just read a pamphlet every once in a while.  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  From the medical community.  You talk to one of your buddies that's still practicing?  Yeah.  Hey, what's going on these days?  Oh, boy.  I was listening to your show the other day.  Dude, you're preaching stuff that's 10 years old.  Yeah.  Electroshock therapy?  Probes?  They had an expert on yesterday on Larry King and some blonde bimbo from one of these  entertainment shows.  And, you know, she was saying how Britney Spears has ruined her life. 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  She's pushed her mother aside.  Her mother's not part of her life anymore.  Nope.  She wrecked her career.  And then she says this.  We've got to get the clip.  She wrecked her body.  Yeah.  She wrecked her body.  She wrecked her career.  She said goodbye to mama.  She said goodbye to her, quote, husband.  And now she's saying goodbye to her kids.  Her kids.  So that's why they're thinking, you know, the next step is her harming herself.  Yeah, that's good.  Disguise the bullet as a bonbon. 
[00:05:00]  You fatty.  And it was really interesting because I think it was TMZ I was watching last night.  They said that she has a love-hate relationship with the paparazzi.  That at this point, she's just going out every day in L.A. knowing the paparazzi are going to follow her around.  And just in case they don't recognize that she's out and about, she puts the top down on her convertible.  Yeah.  And she's just kind of wandering around L.A.  They said she has no real friends or anything.  She has no real purpose.  Her career sucks.  So she gets up and she gets in her car and just kind of wanders around and lets the paparazzi follow her. 
[00:05:30]  Her management dropped her.  Her management dropped her.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  But her album's coming out.  Pretty soon.  What, a couple weeks?  19th or something, I think?  Oh, I don't know.  I don't even know.  I don't care about that part of it.  I love the fact that she's a train wreck.  It makes for some interesting discussion on the show.  When that tanks, though, I'm saying, when her album tanks, that'll be probably the final straw.  Her single, Gimme More, is doing very well on iTunes, though.  Is it?  It's not even that good, though.  It's produced in a studio. 
[00:06:00]  This is how they produce Paris' hit.  Do you know Timberlake wanted to do her studio?  Really?  Timberlake wanted to produce it, and she said no.  That's smart.  He tried to do it with her.  That's smart.  Not having his name attached to it.  Oh, it's dope.  Stop whining.  If you got the right people in the studio, you can make anyone sound like this.  This has very little to do with Britney Spears and her talent. 
[00:06:30]  She should go out and eat some Topps hamburgers.  So that's the big story today.  It's on the front page of all our papers.  Britney loses her kids.  Do you see the post where they wrote it?  This is how great the post is.  Tarts to tots sent to Pops. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, no kidding.  I think some of those rhymes, that guy must have been so happy with that.  Dude, check out my headline.  He'll never get to use that again.  No.  In his headline writing career.  Well, Daily News, I love that sometimes they try a little too hard.  The front page of the Daily News, unfitney.  Instead of Britney.  That's really trying too hard, yeah.  Unfitney.  Unfitney.  Heartbreak for Britney, as Judge says, Singer must hand over a kid's ex-husband.  And they got a picture of Britney with her kid crying.  And the kid's not crying because Britney's handing over the kid to K-Fed. 
[00:07:30]  The kid's crying because he doesn't want to be out and about in L.A.  while she's just messing around with the paparazzi.  Yeah.  The kid wants like a mother.  Like a real mother.  A little stability.  And everyone has changed their tune.  They're all in K-Fed's corner now.  They're like, God, thank God K-Fed's got the kids.  And that wasn't the case a mere three or four months ago.  Yeah.  But now they're like, oh, thank God, maybe the kids will be safe now.  With K-Fed.  Yeah, who would have thought that? 
[00:08:00]  Well, it's not like he'll be out on tour.  That's true.  There's plenty of time to take care of the kids at home.  Exactly.  His phone's not ringing off the hook.  No.  And then the other big story that we were discussing in the office, like Isaiah Thomas is F'd.  And I don't even know why he's F'd.  I know.  I don't get this story at all.  I have been following this case.  I don't really understand what happened.  Isaiah Thomas, of course, the next coach.  You know, it's a multi-million dollar loss, sexual harassment lawsuit. 
[00:08:30]  $10 million this woman wants for being sexually harassed at work because apparently he called  her a bitch.  Is that what it comes down to?  That's all I've heard, the news comment that the B word, called her the B word.  And Madison Square Garden is saying they fired her because she wasn't doing her job.  But now, you know, it depends on what jury you get. 
[00:09:00]  Well, they're hinting.  Yeah, apparently they're hinting that they're going to see it her way, in her favor.  It's now just down to how much money they're going to give her.  Punitive damage is here that you're giving me.  I got to tell you, you know, we work with a lot of women around here.  I'm very cordial.  I'll nod.  I'll say hi.  And that is it.  Yeah.  It is too scary now.  Yep.  You can just say something very what you think is innocent because you don't know any better.  Nothing too crazy.  And next thing you know, you're being either fired or there's a lawsuit against you for millions of dollars. 
[00:09:30]  And next thing you know, it could be a year, two years later.  All of a sudden, you're going, what happened?  What?  Right.  September, two years ago, I said bitch or something.  And now I'm being sued for $10 million.  It happened to a very good friend of mine in this business.  And trust me, this guy was as innocent as they come.  And the company had a fight for him.  It was a multi-million dollar lawsuit. 
[00:10:00]  In the end, it worked out in his favor.  He's okay.  But he went through hell for a couple of years.  Yeah.  Because someone that was part of his morning show, who was the biggest, like, slut in town,  sued him for sexual harassment because of some, like, just dumb little bit they were doing one morning.  I don't even know what it was, to be honest with you.  That's why.  There ain't no place for no broads in this studio.  Yeah.  Ain't no place for no broads.  See?  Know who said we should hire a broad? 
[00:10:30]  1948.  I was talking to Sean Hannity a few months back.  He's like, I think you guys really need a broad in there just to keep you guys, you know, between the lines.  I'm like, are you insane?  Keep your skirt on.  That's why we don't have broads.  It's that easy.  It happens to a lot of radio guys.  All of a sudden, the broad doesn't like something, and she's claiming sexual harassment.  Runs off, claims sexual harassment, and tries to get you for money.  And that's why we don't have broads as interns, for the most part, because it's just too scary. 
[00:11:00]  Yep.  We made an exception with Renee.  She's really, really good.  Yeah.  And she fits in.  The other girl's gone already.  Is she really?  Yeah, she's gone, and I'm fine with that, because it makes me nervous.  I'm telling you, watch me after the show.  I'll walk down the hall.  I'll be very nice, and I'll be cordial to anyone that works for the same company I do.  But I'm not going to say much more than, hi, having a good day?  That's it.  No more pats on the ass from me. 
[00:11:30]  That's for sure.  I'm a little scared.  I'm not going to go patting them or trying to hold them like bowling balls.  I miss the ass pinch myself.  I miss the old.  Good-ass pinch.  Now it's just us men patting each other on the ass.  Yeah.  You always laugh at that one day when we were talking about the pinch recently, and Anthony  described the pinch as the crooked finger and the thumb.  Yeah.  That is the worst boss pinch that you could give your secretary back when it was proper. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Just, like, curl your pointer finger up, and then use your thumb and pinch it against, like,  your knuckle.  There you go, honey.  And you've got to go, when you pinch her, looking good today.  Why don't you come in my office and take some oral dictation?  Show some cleavage.  Yeah.  Well, you're dressed a little, what is it, winter outside?  Come on, honey. 
[00:12:30]  That's how you've got to talk to them.  These broads.  Ah, yeah.  And they're just screwing themselves.  This woman, and now, and women that are working should just crucify this bitch, because here's  what she's doing.  She's preventing companies from hiring women.  Oh, believe me, it's happening out there.  When women claim discrimination, that they're not being hired, it's absolutely because of 
[00:13:00]  this.  Situation like this.  What company wants to sit there and be sued for $10 million for throwing the B word  around?  They called it the B word.  I mean, what the hell is that about?  You guys sit there now, if you're looking at an application between a guy and a woman,  and think, guy ain't gonna sue me.  Most likely, he's not gonna sue me if he hears foul language being thrown around the  workplace.  But the woman, you never know. 
[00:13:30]  So, and they just shoot themselves in the foot with crap like this.  It looks like a gold digging, she probably is a bitch.  Bitch, for all I know.  Well, and I...  From what I've read, all I can conclude is bitch.  Well, and Mendoza the Jew from Jersey, I completely agree with your instant feedback, but if we  read it, we probably would get fired.  Ah, probably.  Just think, uh...  Just, ah, just...  Ah, look at the story.  Look at the story, wink wink. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah.  That's right.  You figure it out.  Look at the story.  I don't know.  How they come up with a figure of $10 million.  What was this woman doing?  And how much damage was done to her that it justifies handing her over $10 million.  You better lose your legs.  What were you feeling? 
[00:14:30]  My feelings were very hurt.  It's Saul Rosenberg.  It's a jerky boy's bit come to life.  Were you hurt?  Were you injured?  My feelings...  Your feelings were hurt.  It's the planet Earth.  Grow up.  That's what happens.  Your feelings get hurt every so often.  It doesn't mean you're entitled to $10 million.  $10 million.  $10 million.  Because you got fired.  I was fired.  I was called a-holes in the workplace. 
[00:15:00]  Uh, you know, I heard things that I didn't like.  You know what you do?  You leave and you go somewhere else.  I've had my ass pinched a few times.  You gotta take the good with the bad.  Had a few pats on the hiney.  Yeah.  For a job well done.  Right.  You worked for Mark Parenteau?  Linger Linger.  She's not even hot either.  She looks like a tranny.  Oh, yeah.  Well, you better be careful with that, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh, she's gonna come after you now.  That gets people fired in this day and age. 
[00:15:30]  Please.  Oh, she's awful looking.  Now you know what...  Isn't she?  Now you know what...  She's a pig.  Now you know what Mendoza the Jew wrote on Instagram feedback.  She looks like a clean-shaven Samuel L. Jackson.  Right, right.  She's not an attractive woman.  Yeah, well...  Wow.  Yeah, look, you...  I'm taking napkins and I'm putting them...  I'm hiding her hair.  Yeah, hide her hair.  And you got Samuel L. Jackson.  She's a terrible looking woman.  How could he harass her? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, I know.  Sexual harassment.  She probably, like, was hoping that he would pay attention to her.  Oh, 10 million.  Let's see how to rooster the trucker.  Rooster, what's up, buddy?  Hey, guys.  I was sexually harassed by this chick there at work and...  All right, hold on.  Hold on, Rooster.  Yeah.  You're a trucker.  Yeah, but you gotta go into the dispatch office.  All right.  Just hearing that a trucker was sexually harassed, something doesn't make sense there. 
[00:16:30]  Went home and had to get in the shower and I whipped.  All right, please say it was another guy.  No, no, no, no.  So you were sexually...  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Slow down, because I want to have a little fun with this.  Rooster, trucker, sexually harassed by a woman, and you had a problem with this?  Well, she is ugly.  If she was hot, I wouldn't have brought her to her.  When did she harass you?  Would you walk into the office to hand her stuff or copy the manifest or something? 
[00:17:00]  How did that happen?  I actually had to go back for some paperwork, and it was in the closet area, and she comes  in there, and I've been over to get the paperwork, and she just grabs my ass.  And we just got done going through sexual harassment training, and I brought it up to my boss.  I said, look, you know, she's grabbing me and everything.  He says, what was his answer? 
[00:17:30]  He said something like, there's no need to ruffle any feathers.  Ruffle any feathers.  That's good.  So they just swept it out of her.  But if I would have grabbed her ass, I would have been out the door.  Yeah.  I don't think you should have went to human resources on that one.  Wow.  I hate human resources.  Every once in a while, we have to deal with those people.  What a waste of money.  HR.  HR.  HR needs to talk to you.  Why does HR ever have to talk to me? 
[00:18:00]  We do a radio show.  What did we do now?  Who decided that you need an HR department at a radio station?  Are you kidding me?  You know where this whole thing started?  It was a bunch of guys smoking pot, playing their favorite records.  Fast forward a few decades, and now you have HR to deal with.  What you do on the air, too, shouldn't even count.  No, but it does.  It should never count.  But it does at times.  It would be like an actor doing something in a movie, and then the woman, because of 
[00:18:30]  the script and the lines that he read to her, saying, oh, I was sexually harassed.  No, it was your character.  And we get speeches.  If you're going to have a naked woman, you've got to paper the whole studio.  Any window.  Pull the shades down.  Any window that opens up toward the studio has to be completely covered.  There has to be police tape down the hall with a security guard.  Warning.  Warning.  Sign on the door.  Warning.  Don't go any further.  Could be nudity in studio. 
[00:19:00]  Because they don't want someone to just kind of come upon this nudity that might be going  on in a studio.  That's what I want in this studio.  I want, because there's on-air lights outside the studio.  It says on-air so people don't just barge in.  We need a nude light, too, next to it.  Yeah.  So you can hit the nude light so people know.  Don't come in.  Nudity.  Nudity.  Yeah.  I want nudity that people just come upon and stumble upon.  Like, I want Eric nude, grabbing his ankles, and I want people just to walk in and go, 
[00:19:30]  hey, what is this?  What is that?  Like, right in front of the door when they walk in.  No explanation.  No nothing.  That doesn't conjure up a very sexy image.  No, it's awful.  Him with clothes is bad.  Oh, listen to this one.  Robbie from T-Net.  No, no disrespect.  Robbie, what's up?  Hey, boys.  Good morning.  Hey, listen.  It's something a little ironic.  We had a sexual harassment trial going on, and the male employees, while this trial was  going on, refused to speak to the female employees, and during the trial, some of these females 
[00:20:00]  were called to testify, and they were claiming they were being harassed because the men weren't  talking to them, so I thought that was a little ironic.  Yeah, isn't that great?  It's a hostile work environment, they call it, when they're not being spoken to.  Yet, if you talk to them in the wrong way, then there's a sexual harassment problem.  Even something as innocent years ago as saying, wow, that dress looks very nice on you, or 
[00:20:30]  your hair is very pretty today, or something like that.  They turn around and, oh, I'm being violated, so you don't talk to them anymore.  Don't give them compliments.  Don't say crap.  Years ago, when women were being harassed, your wife couldn't go to work without your  boss jamming his hand up her dress, that is harassment.  Right.  But that's morphed into, again, a compliment, or one misinterpreted moment, or something  without any vicious intent. 
[00:21:00]  Here's sexual harassment to me in the workplace.  The boss playing grab ass with a woman, the secretary, that, absolutely, and the boss asking for certain  things for promotions.  Like, hey, you know, if you do this, I'll kick you up to this position.  That is sexual harassment.  Commenting on a woman's hair, her dress, things like that, that's not sexual harassment. 
[00:21:30]  I'm so with you, man.  So with you.  Saying you're being a bitch, that's not sexual harassment, if she's being a bitch.  Because when guys are in the workplace, and they're working, and some guy is being an  a-hole, you call him out as one.  That's just the way it works.  The boss goes around and goes, you screwed this up.  You're a jackass, or whatever.  You know, your attitude stinks.  No one bothers me.  You got to treat him with kid gloves?  Where you already lost, like, the offices with cubicles? 
[00:22:00]  Yeah.  This is what amazes me when you read the stories about the firehouses.  Yep.  The police stations.  Everything's got to be sexual harassment free.  The garages.  Yeah.  The last bastion of, like, playboy cutouts and things like that, where the mechanics garages.  They can't even have their calendars up anymore.  Nope.  That's when I'm like, wow, we're just out of control here.  But then the women come in with their hubba hubba firemen, NYPD or FDNY calendars. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, look at this guy.  He's a hunk.  Nice buns.  Shut up, you frow.  And they hang that crap up.  But guys don't do anything.  They got to look at that.  I'm sexually harassed every time I talk about it all the time when I try to buy underwear.  And you buy a box of underwear, unless it's Fruit of the Looms with a bunch of guys dressed as grapes and plums.  You're going to be seeing guys half naked on a box of underwear that you got to buy. 
[00:23:00]  How about, you know, go to the store and just see all over the place nude women.  Yes.  Something changed out there in society.  We used to have, like, hot broads all over the place.  You can put up pictures of broads anywhere.  Hot broads all over the place.  And now there's, like, there's what can only be described as a homo culture going on.  I swear to God, man. 
[00:23:30]  I was downtown here in Manhattan sitting on some furniture.  There is a billboard of a guy in nothing but tiny, tiny little underpants.  It's part of the homo culture.  That used to be, like, a hot broad in a bra with cleavage.  Yeah, you show that and you get in trouble.  But that's not okay anymore.  But guys naked all over the place is completely acceptable.  Guys twisting around with the abs you could hit with a cannonball. 
[00:24:00]  They're up on billboards everywhere.  Women are drooling over them.  Right.  And the second you pull out anything, Jesus Christ, the second you could rip out a little  picture from Beaver Hunt in one of those magazines and put it up and you get in trouble.  Yeah.  There's a billboard on Houston.  It's a black model.  And he's, like, he's up on one knee and it's front to wear.  Oh, God.  And he's in the best shape of anyone I've ever seen.  And it looks like Mr. Snuffleupagus is robbing a bank. 
[00:24:30]  It's like, how is that so big on a billboard?  How is that not a problem?  It doesn't make any sense.  We've lost our masculinity.  We've lost any, any, uh, uh, the balls.  Right.  We, we, we can't do anything without this fear of being taken to court.  Again, because lawyers, which are just scum of the earth.  And, and you're, what I like to call your bitch lawyers are even worse. 
[00:25:00]  They're vicious, bloodthirsty, man-hating pieces of crap.  I, I can't stand lawyers anyway.  But women lawyers are the worst.  Lawyerettes.  Lawyerettes, they should call them.  Yeah.  Lawyerettes.  Because they will jump in and they use them all the time.  If a guy is up on sexual harassment charges, he'll usually have a female lawyer.  Because it looks like, oh, look, how bad could he be? 
[00:25:30]  He hired, he hired a slit.  Yeah.  Hey, humpbacks from Whack Bag.  OPS coin a new.  I don't care.  Let some, some of you hear that out there.  Uh, humpbacks from Whack Bag.  OPS coin a new phrase.  Homo culture.  That's right.  The homo culture.  No offense to the fruits, but we want to talk about the homo culture today.  It's, it's, it's all around us.  Yeah.  Homo culture.  It used to be like, uh, there was always just a hot woman in a bra. 
[00:26:00]  What was wrong with that?  Topless in a movie.  What the hell was wrong with that?  Lingerie models.  Now it's all about guys.  Guys, half nude.  We have entered the homo culture.  It's all around us.  And the women love it.  They chitter chatter about it by the water cooler with their new calendar.  Look at this guy.  Wow.  I wouldn't mind finding his shoes under my bed in the morning. 
[00:26:30]  He's a real beefcake, this one.  A beefcake.  I hope the only time that fireman's in your apartment is pulling your charred corpse out  of your bed.  Or because he made smoke and put a fake mask on just so you'd open the door.  He'd cuff you to the bed for a week.  That's a good character.  That ghoul.  And no, I'm not misogynistic.  I'm really not.  I love women.  Ask some women out there.  I adore them. 
[00:27:00]  But it's just this overly empowered thing.  And I don't even care if they're more empowered than men.  But then you gotta deal with society in the way it is.  Right.  You're gonna catch some crap.  And you can't go running to a lawyer every time someone calls you a bitch.  Well, this guy did.  Bruce in Wisconsin.  Bruce.  Bruce.  What's up, Bruce?  Ah, he's gone.  Bruce went away.  He had to tell his boss to stop grabbing his ass.  Yes. 
[00:27:30]  Grabbing his ass.  See, if I had a female boss, do whatever the hell you want to me.  I don't care.  You know what I mean?  What's wrong with these burly truck drivers that are sexually harassed?  I would love Tracy here just to harass me.  To call me into her office and harass me.  Yeah, give me a good spanking.  Yeah, give me a good fondling.  For misbehaving.  So we want more examples of the homo culture that is all upon us.  It's about time we discuss this. 
[00:28:00]  It's everywhere.  All the hot chick billboards are being replaced by men wearing nothing.  Yeah.  The underwear boxes.  There's plenty of things.  You go into the mall and look around and it's just...  Yeah, you could get your jollies at a Victoria's Secret window or something.  You go in there and that's like, all right, the chicks are there.  You could go in there and see some models and pictures of really hot models.  But that's about it.  Yeah.  Anywhere else though, just regular stores. 
[00:28:30]  That's it.  All right, we'll get more examples today.  Our phone number is 877-212-O-N-A.  And when we get back, speaking of sexual harassment in the workplace, we have a 1943 Guide to Hiring Women.  1943.  Let's reenact these rules.  This has kind of been sitting around for the last couple of days, but this is the perfect day to do this one.  It certainly is.  We'll get into that next.  I bet they have it.  I bet they hit the nail right on the head. 
[00:29:00]  It's hilarious, actually.  I love that.  1943.  How about this?  I'll just give you one as we go to break.  Whenever possible, let the inside employee change from one job to another at some time during the day.  Women are inclined to be less nervous and happier with change.  I love it.  Like they're dumb animals, and they just like to see new scenery.  Look, I understand new scenery. 
[00:29:30]  I understand we had to improve from this, from 1943, but we don't have to keep improving.  Yeah.  It should have gotten to a level like, good enough!  There are some things that are fixed.  Right.  You don't have to keep fixing and fixing and fixing.  The organizations that were there to fix them should just disband.  Just disband.  All right.  Hey, uh, the phones are lit about homoculture.  I think we're on...  Homoculture.  And like I said, no offense to the fruits that listen to our show.  We love yous.  We love the fruits. 
[00:30:00]  We love you petunias.  They never complain if you give their ass a little pinch.  No!  Good double knuckle pinch.  They just turn their head backwards, cover their mouth, and go,  And they kick up their boot as they wear leather shorts.  It's like, you're a lawyer.  Why are you wearing leather shorts and boots in the office?  Should you wear assless chaps to court?  It's Opie and Anthony. 
[00:30:30]  That's right.  It's New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Der Commissar.  Uh-oh.  Ja, ja, ja.  Who's this?  Falco?  What?  Fire.  Huh?  After the fire.  Oh, wow.  Yeah, you're right.  Falco is...  Rock me, Amadeus.  Come on and rock me, Amadeus.  Rock me, Amadeus.  Isn't Falco dead?  Yeah, he kind of got into it. 
[00:31:00]  No?  We went through this before, didn't we?  Yeah, Falco's dead.  Yeah, Falco died in a head-on collision, I think.  Really?  No, we got to do.  You got to get 80s New Wave songs just to the hook that we can play before the break,  and that'll make people linger longer.  Right.  Because then they have to figure out who did the song.  Like, this would have been a perfect one.  Yep.  And then we would have said after the fire, and people would have went,  Oh, I knew that one!  And then our ratings go up.  Right.  Phone number 877-212-ON-A. 
[00:31:30]  Duck Commissar.  Let's go to Chris in Boston.  Chris, what's going on, buddy?  Not too much.  My wife used to work for a fabulous retailer in San Francisco.  Mm-hmm.  And the guys, it was 80% gay men that worked there, and they had, like...  This was back in 92, so back then it was...  There was shirtless Ricky Martin calendars all over the place and stuff like that. 
[00:32:00]  Like, completely inappropriate.  Wow.  I was wondering if you had any more.  You haven't seen, you know...  Was she fine with it?  Yeah.  All right, sir.  Mr. Excitement.  Way to bring it home.  Yeah, thanks, sir.  Let's go to Tank in New Jersey.  Tank!  Tank, turn that radio track down.  Tank, who won the big game last night?  Tank.  What's up?  What's up, Tank? 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, I was...  You didn't get it.  Great.  I only did an hour on the name Tank one day.  Tank.  Go ahead, Tank.  Yeah, I was sexually harassed at my last unit.  I'm in the military.  Hold on.  Time out.  Chris Cox from XM Channel 81.  BPM.  Falco originally did Dirk Komasar.  After the Fire was the U.S. cover version.  Ah.  It's a remake?  Yeah, didn't he do it in German or something?  There you go.  It's coming in a couple times. 
[00:33:00]  Falco did the original German version of Dirk Komasar.  Then After the Fire did the English remake.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  All right.  What's up, Tank?  Steve would know.  Yeah, I'm in the military, and at my last unit, I was sexually harassed a co-worker or a shipmate.  Yeah.  In what way?  Well, she's female, and I ranked her by quite a bit, but I still had to worry about how it could get twisted back on me.  You know, the military has to walk on eggshells with all the tail hook, tail gait, whatever else they got going on lately. 
[00:33:30]  So she sexually harassed you, but what you're worried about is how this might be turned around against you.  Oh, absolutely, because I was her superior.  I say you've got to bring back that whole sex thing to the office.  It makes the day so much more exciting.  Yeah.  You know, most of us have horrific, boring-ass jobs, and the one thing you look forward to was, like, seeing a secretary, you know, dressing a little sexy.  A little sexy. 
[00:34:00]  With a short skirt or some cleavage hanging out.  Let's bring that back.  You know, maybe you ladies, you enjoy the boss's nice buns.  It just made the workday fly by.  The military's got a huge problem with that.  Yeah.  I watch a lot of the military shows on cable, and there are so many women doing so many things in the military now that it's impossible to work without working around some.  Even in some combat situations, you know, they take support roles. 
[00:34:30]  And I don't think you hear a tenth of what goes on as far as sexual harassment suits and things like that in the military.  I say we go back to the old days where just the guys get in there and the women stay home to be like Rosie the Riveter.  Rosie the Riveter.  You build the stuff.  We'll take it into combat. 
[00:35:00]  That's right.  Let's say hi to Leanne in Boston listening on BCN.  Leanne, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Basically, when I was working at this job, this guy said if I died, he would do my corpse.  Ah.  No.  So I kind of took that as like, uh, what?  Are you that hot where your corpse is actually doable?  I'm pretty cute.  Oh, okay.  I don't think there's a woman alive that's so hot that you'd want to F her corpse. 
[00:35:30]  Call me crazy, but I don't know.  It would depend on when she died.  Hold on, miss.  It would depend on how far the time was before your opportunity when she died.  If it was a week, that's no good.  But if it's 20 minutes, who's looking?  Might as well keep busy until the paramedics arrive.  I mean, as long as it's not like, if someone's going to say something to me, I'm not going  to consider it sexual harassment because that's just stupid.  But if it's like, you're going to do my corpse, it's kind of, you know, messed up. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  All right.  Thank you, Leanne.  Yeah, that could be a bit of a problem.  We understand that one, obviously.  Let's say hi to Glenn in Jersey.  Glenn, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Little Jimmy, what's happening?  Hey, man.  Just wanted to comment about going to the mall, walking past some of the stores, I  think it's like Abercrombie and Finch, where they got the guy model standing out in front  luring your girl to get into the store.  But you don't get to see the same thing, walking past the story secrets. 
[00:36:30]  That's part of the homoculture.  They got an Abercrombie store on, where is it now, Fifth Avenue here in New York City?  Yeah.  And they got male models that have their jeans, you know, pushed all the way down to  the...  Oh, forget about it.  ...to the region.  And that's what you see as you walk in the door.  Yeah, it's like, great.  But if you had women doing the same thing, there would be outrage all over the place.  That's what I'm talking about.  The homoculture is hot right now.  Exactly.  Hot women in advertising is almost a no-no at this point. 
[00:37:00]  And I walk by that store, I do some shopping at Abercrombie.  Who do you?  And it's amazing.  You'll walk into the store on Fifth Avenue, you got two or three male models, and all  these girls that are barely teenagers getting their pictures taken with the models and stuff,  thinking it's the cutest thing and all.  And then you go in, you buy a couple things, and they put it in the bag.  I'm like, no thanks, I'll carry my own clothes out.  Because you gotta walk around with a bag with these hunks on it. 
[00:37:30]  He's a hunk.  It's pretty much gay porn on your bag.  It absolutely is gay porn.  All you wanted was some overpriced jeans with some holes in it, and next thing you know,  you're walking around the city with this bag.  There's some guy with his bedroom eyes and his hands behind his head slightly twisted  at the waist, and you're carrying the bag down the sidewalk like, why am I carrying this?  Yeah, he's laying in a cornfield.  Look, what is that? 
[00:38:00]  He's laying in a cornfield.  I don't need...  E-Rock just pulled it up from the Abercrombie & Fitch site.  There you go.  That's what...  Jesus.  I have a pair of their underwear.  Just gotta deal with it.  I have one pair I bought on the road, and it's the bikini briefs.  Why, Jimmy?  Dude, I was on the road, I had no idea why.  I bought a pair of Abercrombie & Fitch bikini briefs, and my fat stomach, I look like a  toilet paper tube with a marshmallow shoved into it.  I'm completely unsexy in them. 
[00:38:30]  It didn't do that to you?  You didn't all of a sudden get abs?  No, they look good on me.  The underwear looks really good on me if I wear a shirt that hides the stomach.  If you could just see the ass and the leg part.  My legs look good coming out of the bottom, but from the waist up, I should just be shot.  But let's say hi to Rick in Nebraska.  Rick, what's up?  Oh, man.  I don't get why they have to advertise that stuff in male magazines.  I mean, I kind of get the store.  That's for your lady's wishful thinking. 
[00:39:00]  But why would I open my magazine?  I have to look at seven nail nude pictures of her cologne and underwear.  Yeah, that's true.  Magazines.  You thumb through magazines, and again, the culture just slaps you right in the ass.  The culture of homo.  No offense.  No offense.  What happened?  I don't know.  How the hell did we get to this point?  George in Jersey.  George?  Hi. 
[00:39:30]  Good morning, gentlemen.  How are you, sir?  All right.  Quick story.  My old boss was gay, and his fetish was fat guys.  And it just so happens that me and my co-worker are both fat, and we got harassed on a daily basis.  Well, big bears, are you?  Show me your belly, and you'll get to do less work.  Ew.  So show him your belly, man.  I'm all for less work.  I'm going to show Tom my belly. 
[00:40:00]  I'm going to hope for the best.  Less work.  Less work.  It's not like you have to, you know.  You know how some truck drivers are big?  Yeah.  He would sit out there on the forklift and watch, and then he'd run to the bathroom as soon as they left.  I don't get it.  It was awful.  Sounds it.  I think I would have showed the belly for less work.  Absolutely.  But that's my line right there.  That's as far as you go.  That's as far as I go. 
[00:40:30]  No oopsies, no short shorts.  But I'll show my belly real fast if it means an hour less work.  Would you accept free gifts from him?  Would I accept?  What's the gift?  Yeah, what's the gift?  Is it like an Xbox or what?  Sweatshirts, T-shirts, hats.  That's not a great gift, sir.  Those gifts suck.  That's swag.  It's not exactly a Jaguar.  Here's a sweatshackie.  All right, fellas.  I'm punching out.  Have a great day.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, what would you do for like a Jag or a nice car?  Oh, please.  How far would you go?  And I could buy my own Jag, but please.  If your boss is coming on to you.  Yeah, right.  I'd whip Tom in the office for a Jaguar.  Or I'd tie him up and spank him.  And any fantasy he had, I'd act out for it, Jag.  Let's go to Dave in dorm.  Dave, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  What's going on, Dave?  Hey, not much. 
[00:41:30]  You know, Jimmy was just talking about buying the undies from Abercrombie and Fitch.  I feel, you just feel kind of dirty walking into that store.  I mean, there's nude guys everywhere on the walls.  But last time I went in there, I bought a pair of pants or whatever, and they gave me this bag with this dude that was, you know, just ripped guy in his underpants just like hanging out on the front of the bag.  So I actually asked if they had any bags with chicks on them.  Yeah, there you go.  And what do they say?  Well, there's a girl behind my counter, and she's like, well, I don't know if we have any of those right now. 
[00:42:00]  I'm like, well.  Right now.  I'm really gay walking around with this bag.  Can you just check and see if you got any bags of chicks on them?  I end up.  Go ahead.  She laughed at me, but she actually got one.  I end up walking out of the store with my own clothes under my arm.  Yep.  No bags, thank you.  And what's up with the music in Abercrombie?  You can't hear anyone.  No.  They come dancing up to you like, you need any help?  What size are you?  What?  What size jean do you need? 
[00:42:30]  Oh, God, I love this song.  You have that in a 32 waist?  What?  A 32 waist.  What?  Oh, I need to stand music.  How?  Do you have any of these left in a 32?  Hello?  Can you hear me?  You're looking right at me.  Then you find yourself kind of shuffling over to the changing area.  Oh, God. 
[00:43:00]  With your purchases or potential purchases.  And all the changing area is like saloon doors that are about five inches high.  So you're naked with just like barely being covered.  Your legs and the top of you is hanging out.  I do feel vulnerable.  I hate that.  My little legs, you can see them.  My little legs.  My little legs are exposed.  Barely covering, you know.  Now coming to the register.  Let's give a big hand to Randy. 
[00:43:30]  Randy is coming to the register now to help you check out.  Give him a big hand.  Yeah.  Woo!  That's awful.  Yeah.  I hate walking in those stores.  Let's say hi to Russ in Connecticut.  One more here.  We got to talk about this guide to hiring women from 1943.  Yes.  Russ, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Good.  Yeah.  I used to work in elementary school. 
[00:44:00]  I was the only guy in the school.  I was filled with a bunch of cougar women.  And during Christmas, I had one of those gift exchanges.  And I'm sitting there in the lunchroom.  You got a three-year-old in the next room having their lunch.  And they're handing out, like, phallic-shaped pasta, like, sex tape.  They used to tie each other up.  And, like, I was just this, like, 22-year-old guy.  And, like, one of the gifts that I got was just a glow-in-the-dark underwear with a tie.  I was supposed to wear, like, you know, that's it only.  It didn't bother me.  But, you know, the situation was reversed. 
[00:44:30]  I think there'd be some problems.  Did anyone remember office parties where you had the Secret Santa?  And every gift was some crazy gag sex gift.  You can't do that anymore.  No.  Get in trouble.  I wonder how many of these women that file these charges or get offended or make a stink about it have those parties over their house.  Those dild parties.  Sex toys.  And sex, marital AIDS parties.  Yeah.  But they're all laughing and giggling and shaking them in each other's faces. 
[00:45:00]  And then they get to work.  And the first thing, if somebody says something that they perceive is out of line, they run.  Oh, I'm offended.  By the way, Dirty Ralph, come on.  Opie showing belly for less work equals Rich Voss dressing sexy for more crack.  I was kidding.  Rich Voss wasn't.  That's the difference right here.  I hope he hasn't done that.  Rich Voss has.  I can't believe I have to explain that to you.  Let's go to Corey.  He used to work at Abercrombie in Ohio here. 
[00:45:30]  What's up, Corey?  What's going on, buddy?  Hey.  I used to work at the home office.  And the CEO of Abercrombie, he's all, and he's like 60 years old.  His face is all cut up from plastic surgery.  And he tries to dress like these 22-year-old dudes that he's trying to hit on at the home office.  It's really messed up. 
[00:46:00]  Hmm.  Interesting.  Hmm.  Yeah.  Well, I guess we should just take a break.  Yeah.  Thanks, Corey.  Thank you.  Thank you, girl's name.  It is New Wave Tuesday.  Here's a taste from Club Soda Candy.  We can dance if we want to.  You can leave your friends behind.  Because if your friends don't dance, and if they don't dance, well, they're no friends of mine.  What the hell?  What a wrong inflection using idiot. 
[00:46:30]  He couldn't fit the words in.  You got a song for New Wave Tuesday that we're going to play before break?  Remember, I suggested that about 15 minutes ago, Iraq.  Please tell me you have one.  I got one.  What a terrible place to put the emphasis.  And if your friends don't dance, and if they don't dance,  and if they don't dance,  then they're no friends of mine.  You got one?  Safety dunce.  All right, it's Opie and Anthony.  Hopefully, like, you hear this, 
[00:47:00]  and then you're going to need to know who does this song.  You better pick a hard one.  It is.  Here's a New Wave song.  I want to be a cowboy.  You can be my cowgirl.  What the hell's wrong with you?  I want to be a cowboy.  Yeah, this is terrible.  I want to be a cowboy.  Like the other stuff was good.  All right, after the break,  we'll let you know what that song is and who does it, whatever. 
[00:47:30]  Dan in Michigan, real fast.  I can't let this one go by.  Go ahead, Dan.  Dan.  Yeah, you're on.  Holy crap.  Talk.  What's the matter with you?  Dan.  Michigan.  Brother went to Abercrombie.  You.  You're right there.  Oh, me?  Abercrombie.  And I heard him.  He went like, hey, hey.  Dan, you there?  He doesn't know.  He doesn't know that he's on the air. 
[00:48:00]  It says, brother went to Abercrombie.  They said size 34 pants was fat.  You can't go in there and get 34s.  Maybe he'll call back.  You big pig.  And really fast, let's go to John in Maine.  John, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  That was hilarious, by the way.  But, hey, I had a buddy who got an insurance check and wanted to go out and, you know,  change his wardrobe, get a bunch of new clothes.  So he went to Abercrombie and Finch.  And the music in there was so loud. 
[00:48:30]  He went up to their front desk and said, hey, listen, I want to spend a ton of money in you  guys at the store, but could you please turn down the music?  And they said, no.  Their policy is to keep the music incredibly loud.  Incredibly.  Incredibly loud.  Incredibly loud.  Well, they do.  Because they don't want you to focus on your purchase.  No.  You just start buying everything.  They want you distracted.  Right.  Between the gay men on all the boxes and packages and bags and the loud music, you don't know 
[00:49:00]  what you're doing.  I don't know.  All right.  Take my credit card.  Just get me out of here.  I'm going to buy this.  What do you mean?  I just paid for four lap dances.  It's like a club.  How did that happen?  I thought this was a clothing store.  What do you mean?  No, I'm not going to try them on.  I just put it.  I ring them up.  I got to get out of here.  The worker was just dancing by me.  I didn't know that meant that I just got a lap dance from them. 
[00:49:30]  What happens?  This store is confusing me.  Why does my a** hurt?  I don't even get that.  Then you got the guys there working on their abs in between refolding the clothes.  You just feel like a complete zero when you walk into the joint.  They're doing curls with the bars that have all the hangers on them.  Right.  The clothes.  You walk over with your little paunch hoping that you can look a little better in one 
[00:50:00]  of their shirts.  Ooh.  All right.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, it's New Wave Tuesday.  Obviously, we still don't know what to do with this bit.  But we played this song before the break so you can sit there and wonder who does this  song.  I don't know this one, to be honest with you. 
[00:50:30]  I don't either.  As far as the band goes.  E-Rock, what's the answer for New Wave Tuesday?  It's called Boys Don't Cry.  No.  That's the band.  No.  Yeah, that's the band.  See, you're such an idiot.  Stupid E-Rock.  That's the band.  No.  Yes, that's the band.  What was that?  You tried so easy for us.  You tried sneaking out of that.  Right.  It's I Want to Be a Cowboy by Boys Don't Cry. 
[00:51:00]  Okay.  Oh, E-Rock.  By the way, this is the second day of E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober.  God bless E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober, in effect.  All right.  Incompetence for the entire month.  Right.  Stupidity and excuses.  It's Obi and Anthony speaking of New Wave Tuesday.  Carl from Long Island.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  He writes, I love Kenny Karaoke.  It always brings a smile to my face. 
[00:51:30]  Also, anonymous woman.  This is happening with the women out there, too, and I want to acknowledge that.  This whole human resource thing, completely out of control.  She writes, it's not just about sexual harassment.  It's anything.  I got called into HR for the first time in 19 years.  Been on the job 19 years.  Wow.  For calling the downstairs office the dungeon.  What does that mean?  She didn't want to, like, you know, continue with that.  She's a little paranoid.  They might be listening. 
[00:52:00]  The dungeon.  So you call it the dungeon, and the people that are working down there feel badly and then can, like, sue?  Yeah, you can read between the lines.  They're insulted.  Well, we're not as important as you guys upstairs.  I see.  Okay.  Then you got Stephen S. from Bayshore.  We better get to this bit soon.  Does that 1943 film mention throwing a blanket over the woman's cage when they get all worked up?  They start squawking.  Guide to hiring women from 1943 on the way.  But Jimmy has a very good observation in the paper today. 
[00:52:30]  Well, before I, we have something.  This is, one of the network problems is they're trying to capture what guys like.  Like, this is, like, on the same theme of when women are running things or when women are, like, their input as far as to what men like is so off.  And we just listened to a promo in the break, and it hurt my soul.  It was so awful.  Hurt your soul.  Because it's, like, this is what they think men like.  Like, ah, the boys will get together. 
[00:53:00]  Do we have the promo for those?  Yeah.  Now, this is a promo for the ABC lineup.  Which both shows are destroyed in the paper today.  I'm telling you, we're onto something today.  This homoculture thing.  It's all around us now.  Because this plays right into what we were talking about about an hour ago.  ABC's mandate promo.  This is part of the homoculture.  It's a fruity.  Have you ever been on a mandate? 
[00:53:30]  What the hell is a mandate?  I guess it's very similar to that mancation.  Mancation.  So you go out with another guy, and it's, well, why do they have to put the word date on there?  It used to just be, like, hanging out.  Yeah, you want to hang out?  Hey, you want to go see the game at the local bar?  Couple of beers?  Couple pitchers of beer.  Root for our favorite team.  Touch each other's c**s.  Maybe see if Tank's there.  Maybe Tank will show up.  Give Tank a call.  No, this is just, it's another soft, like, just fruity attempt at trying to capture what men like. 
[00:54:00]  Men are not this soft.  It's, you know, bunch of guys, bunch of guys, have a mandate.  Get together with the boys and chuckle at the naughty stuff.  Yeah, this is going to give you.  Isn't that, like, what they had, like, a play date for kids?  Yeah.  So then these women, these emasculating women come up with things that we're supposed to do, like a man date?  We are becoming.  What is, I got to know what that is. 
[00:54:30]  We're going to play in a second, but now you brought up something else.  We are just becoming a country of wimps.  Like, and I don't blame my sister because it's part of what, you know, the culture that's around her.  But, you know, her kids go on, on play dates.  I'm like, what the hell's a play date?  It used to be, hey, mom, can I go to, you know, Chris's house?  But now that's called a play date.  And mom would say, no, Chris is a Jew.  I'll call up my sister.  Where's J.D.?  Oh, he's on a play date. 
[00:55:00]  Play date?  The F is that?  It used to just be, hey, I want to go ride bikes with my buddies.  Oh, someone's suggesting here, a Doughboy.  A play date equals monster rain.  Well, that would be called a play date now.  That is a play date, all right.  You know, back in the day, it was just you and your friends getting silly under a porch.  But now mom would have to say, Jimmy's on a play date.  It's a play date.  That's right.  Jimmy, look this way.  The camera's not capturing your face.  Thank you, mother. 
[00:55:30]  All right, here we go.  It's a promo being run by ABC now.  Well, now there's mandates, I guess.  I will never go on a mandate.  Please.  Make a band date with cavemen and carpoolers. 
[00:56:00]  Premieres tonight starting at 8, 7 central on ABC.  Start here.  My name is William and I like to wear dresses.  Is that not chill-inducing how bad that is?  How weak that is?  I can barely talk.  I'll just call it the DCs.  They are trying to imply that watching this is like for men.  And you hang out because your woman, she's not going to understand this kind of comedy. 
[00:56:30]  This is just cutting-edge man comedy.  But they're cavemen.  They're trying to be like, yeah, we know it's like a gay thing.  You know, like employing gay humor the way guys do it.  Because it's part of the homoculture.  I'm telling you, I'm not going to let that one go today.  It's all around us.  It's so weak and such an unfunny, awful promotion.  It's like, what are you doing?  How misinterpreted are men that you think that we're going to rush to that and go, 
[00:57:00]  ha, the man date.  I'm a guy.  That's what I like.  Yeah, man date.  I'm going to invite my friends over to watch Caveman.  You believe in the commercials, stupid asses.  Men like the Sopranos.  That's what men like.  Yeah.  And then they got the voice.  Yeah.  I just picture the...  Man date.  The truckers in our listening audience going, what?  Yeah, huh?  What?  I'm supposed to now call up my pals and ask them if they want to go on a man date?  Ask your friends if you want to go on a man date. 
[00:57:30]  Call up one of your friends today.  This is for the guys.  I'd like to know how this works out.  Maybe you could call tomorrow and tell me how it worked out.  In all seriousness, call them up and just say, dude, you want to go on a man date tonight?  And he'd say, why?  And you go, a man date.  Hey, me and you, we'll go out to a bar.  We'll go do this or something.  And it's a man date.  And watch your friend just hang up, drive over to your house, and punch you in the face  for being an idiot and buying into this. 
[00:58:00]  The only person that should be going on man dates is Larry Craig.  Okay?  Ooh.  Yes.  Tap, tap.  Tap, tap.  Well, they're killing the cavemen in the paper.  And whatever, man.  Maybe it's...  I don't like the concept of the show.  I don't think it's a good concept to take...  I mean, you know, the Geico.  I never thought the commercials were funny.  I didn't think they were clever or witty.  Bunch of cavemen.  Oh, we get it.  But this David B.  Oncully from the Daily News, I hope that he backs over his own throat with a lawnmower.  I have a personal thing because he trashed Lucky Louie. 
[00:58:30]  So again, that's a personal thing.  I don't like him.  It skewers my judgment.  But he writes that he gave it zero stars.  And he goes, ABC declined to send out review copies of the caveman inspired by these ubiquitous  Geico ads.  It doesn't matter.  I'm reviewing it anyway.  I hate it.  It's the worst comedy of the year.  How can I say I haven't seen it?  I can trash it when I haven't seen the inaugural episode.  He's saying because he saw the original pilot, which did sound like it stunk, in July.  And they didn't send out the new one.  So he's automatically trashing it and giving it zero stars.  Saying it stunk. 
[00:59:00]  And I don't even mind where this is coming from.  But the guy, just the fat arrogance to trash the show before you've seen the actual pilot.  I'm sure it stinks.  Look.  But.  And I'm not above doing that.  Believe me.  I trash things before I see them all the time.  I trash bands I've never heard because I'm an ass.  And I just know certain movies, if I see a movie trailer, I know the movie is not for  me and I will never, ever see it.  They're just certain movies. 
[00:59:30]  You see the trailer and, you know.  A sensitive story between two people that, I'm not going to see this.  Just not going to see it.  Missing out.  Why?  Notebook was terrific.  Chick flick.  Stop it.  Here's a lining.  I sat through the letter.  This tells you everything you need to know about these people.  I'm comfortable assuming that I've sampled enough of the caveman to steer clear and advise  you to do likewise.  Let me advise you.  Why would you advise people to do likewise?  It hurt you.  Why not just watch it this week, let everybody hate it, and then trash it next week? 
[01:00:00]  Absolutely.  Let's go to Eddie in Rockland.  And most people don't even read that paragraph.  They just see caveman zero stars.  Yeah, of course.  And Nick Kroll is a guy in it.  He's a funny dude.  I mean, I conceptually don't like the show.  So, I mean, maybe they pull it off, but I don't know.  We'll have to wait and see.  Eddie and Rockland, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How you doing, man?  Love your show, please.  You guys are the best.  Thank you.  Thanks, Eddie.  Thank you.  I'm doing a mancation, I think.  I'm really afraid now.  We're going eight guys to West Virginia to go riding ATVs and four-wheelers and dirt bikes. 
[01:00:30]  Are you calling it...  Don't call it a mancation.  Are you guys calling it a mancation?  No, we're not.  I'm kidding.  I'm kidding.  But now I'm getting scared here in this morning.  Oh, but you're going with your buddies to do that?  But it's just going with your buddies somewhere.  See, guys have been going away with other guys for forever.  But for some reason in the last year or two, they now call it mancations and stuff like that.  It's just fruity.  Well, the whittification of America, right?  The whittification of America? 
[01:01:00]  I think so, yeah.  I'll be alone and take a handcation.  Exactly.  That stupid hill man in Boston calls his show the man town.  Man town.  Like, he brags that he likes hanging out with men.  Just the men.  Maybe you picked the wrong girl to marry if you want to hang out with other men.  Love hanging out with girls.  Absolutely.  Girls rule.  And then there's radio stations that put together a room where just men could go and be alone.  Yeah, what... 
[01:01:30]  That's just your day.  That's just like hanging out.  Our day here is pretty much hanging out with the guys.  There's a radio station that I know very well.  And they put together one of these packages where it was a place to go in your own home to be a man.  And they gave away a flat screen TV.  Yeah, because you need that.  And maybe a little bar area.  So when you have other men over, you guys want something to drink.  What do you have?  And you want a nice stiff one and a drink?  I think they called it the man cave giveaway or something like that. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, that's good.  Man cave?  No kidding.  But it was...  You want a bar down in Chelsea?  And I'm thinking to myself, if you need a room in your house where you have to be by yourself with other men,  you're just miserable in your life and you don't like the girl you decided to marry.  Has nothing to do with the man thing and getting together with the guys.  You just don't want to be with your chick.  Right.  You know, there's a lot of guys that can hang with their friends and watch a football game and maybe your chick does too, whatever.  And it's just what it is. 
[01:02:30]  But when you have to, like, set aside a room in your house that you call the man cave that a radio station's giving away,  giving you the fine, you know, flat screen TV and the great sound system and the real nice couches and the stupid, like, hats with the beer cans on the side for you and your pals.  There's something wrong with your relationship.  Just turn to each other and look.  I couldn't imagine turning to my buddy, looking and seeing him wearing that stupid hat with the beer cans in it and me wearing the same.  And then just kind of nod like, this is it, man. 
[01:03:00]  This is the life.  How about this?  Everybody knows.  I love women.  I love women.  But they are a truck tire on the larynx of fun.  They're not fun.  They're just not.  I mean, they're fun for sex and to hang occasionally.  But you're not going to go out and hang with a chick the same way you do with another guy.  But when the networks try to sell it, but they sell it without any edge, without anything that makes what hanging with a guy fun.  Yeah.  You know, what do you think?  Two men are going to sit on the couch and be naughty and high five? 
[01:03:30]  Dude, carpoolers and cavemen, get me a frosted beverage.  It's coming on.  It's coming on.  Quick, hurry.  Get the popcorn and Funyuns.  No one is going to do that.  Guys want to watch the Honeymooners and then cut a gasser and fall asleep.  Yeah.  That's it.  That's it.  They're trying to position this like it's this thing that men have to sit around and watch like Monday Night Football or something.  I'm sad for you, though.  You don't have fun with your lady?  I have a great time with my woman.  I'm saying in general. 
[01:04:00]  Are there times you want to go off and hang with your guy friends and have some laughs?  With your friends and stuff, but...  My girlfriend's a weird one because she's funny as far as she slams me.  I mean, she makes me laugh like other guys make me laugh.  Yeah.  But that's rare.  I'm generalizing.  I have a lot of fun with her, actually.  It annoys me how much fun I have with her.  I can't thump her.  Alrighty.  80s New Wave Tuesday.  Yes, we got a brand new sweep. 
[01:04:30]  Ooh.  Shall we play a game?  Let's 80s New Wave Tuesday.  The world was moving.  The fair wizard, and she was.  Shy, shy.  Hush, hush.  I do I.  You're too.  Shy, shy.  Hush, hush.  I do I.  Oh, I need some tasty waves.  Cool buzz.  And I'm fine.  And I run.  I run so far away. 
[01:05:00]  I just run.  I run both night and day.  I couldn't get away.  He's the way to Tuesday.  Well, this week, Roland's the star.  That's for sure.  Roland.  I run.  I run so far away.  And I run.  Wrong tense.  He is so bad.  They're all bad.  That's why it's great.  You got Roland, you got Steve, and you got Club Soda Candy doing those. 
[01:05:30]  You know what was great, by the way, in the beginning of that was the, uh, would play a game and war games.  I love when a guy is typing in.  It's so awful.  Hello, Joshua.  Hello, Joshua.  Mouthing everything he's typing.  It's so.  Yeah, why would you say what you're typing?  Just type it.  Uh, hello, Joshua.  No, you don't have to do that.  It's 25 years ago.  I still can't communicate with my computer like that when my computer learns a lesson.  My stupid computer will play tic-tac-toe until the entire solar system fell apart and never learn anything. 
[01:06:00]  It would never learn, after two seconds, the only winning move is not to play.  Oh, wow.  Not only did you learn, you came up with something beautiful.  You're a poet slash computer slash my dead son.  Just unplug the goddamn thing.  You don't have the whopper.  My computer has learned nothing except maybe how to find transgendered websites.  On its own now.  On its own.  It is learning.  Will you play a game, Daddy? 
[01:06:30]  Daddy.  The only winning move is to not lift the dress.  Let's say hi to Fuzzy in Connecticut.  Fuzzy, what's up?  Yeah, whatever happened to the term boys' night out?  Like, did that not become PC or something?  Is that not a good term anymore?  Why does it have to be man something?  My guys and I have been getting together for like, I don't know, three years on Thursday nights.  We drink and play video games, and it's never been a mandate.  Well, now they're called mandates. 
[01:07:00]  They're trying to be funny.  It's just trying to be funny and like crazy.  They don't understand when guys, like, you know how guys will hump each other and be stupid in high school?  Like, they don't understand, but they do.  I mean, the guys do.  Like football hazings?  Yeah, but you know what?  Like, they're trying to capture that part of man humor or male humor.  Yeah.  And they're missing horribly.  Yeah, I don't think they understand what that is.  Yeah.  It's not good.  Jimmy, a truck tire on the Larynx?  That's ridiculous.  I love you.  Thank you, sir.  Of course it was stupid, but I couldn't think of anything.  Perfect.  I wanted to say Larynx.  There you go. 
[01:07:30]  And what worse on your Larynx than a truck tire?  A truck tire?  It's pretty much going to solve the problem.  Certainly would.  of that non-humor coming out.  Smokezilla from Kentucky wants Roland to sing Rock Lobster today by the B-52s.  Jared in Texas, what's up?  What's up, guys?  There's actually a local radio station here out of Austin in Texas, KLBJ, and they're actually  running a promo about a man cave.  Totally.  This is one of the big promotions that radio stations are doing. 
[01:08:00]  A man cave.  And they give these away?  Well, they set up the ultimate room in your house where you could go and be with the guys.  Why?  The stupid radio station banner?  Right.  Oh, God, I'm sure.  Gotta have the radio station banner with the guys.  Yeah, big TV, couch, we'll all sit there, eat Funyuns.  Huh?  Y'all should pull the promo.  I might be able to send it to y'all so y'all can run it.  It's just stupid.  We would love to hear those because so many stations across America, that's the big promotion 
[01:08:30]  they're doing lately in the last couple of years.  Play ring toss and Funyuns with our friends.  Hey, uh.  Hold on, dude.  You at the man cave should have a big screen TV, all your football stuff, and then like  a hole dug in the middle with leaves around it, so when your unfun wife walks in, she plummetes  into the bottom.  And then you can watch football while she's at the bottom of a well, screaming.  Pungy sticks.  All right.  Where do I email that to?  Uh, hold on the line.  We would love that, actually. 
[01:09:00]  Thanks, Jared.  Okay, uh, you got another New Wave song as we go to break?  When we get back, we're going to do the 1943 Guide to Hiring Women.  But first, here's another New Wave song that you got to figure out, uh, I don't know who  does it, right?  All right.  Go ahead, E-Rock.  I think I know this.  Yeah, I know this one.  Yeah.  It's an E-Rock.  I hope spun this song.  College radio.  Yeah. 
[01:09:30]  N-V-A-B.  You're picking horrible songs for 80s New Wave Tuesday.  I'm going to have to give you a list.  This is the Thompson Twins.  Yeah.  And it's not even a hit.  This was like the third song off the record.  It still was pretty popular.  Enough to know it was the Thompson Twins.  I had no idea who it was.  How about another one?  I didn't know it was supposed to what?  It was supposed to be easy.  Not necessarily easy, but...  And it's supposed.  You forgot the D at the end of that. 
[01:10:00]  Zilch.  You know D using zilch.  He leaves the last D off for donut.  Do like Metro of Love or something.  Leave off the last D for dumbbell.  It is E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober.  Leave off the last D for don't get there on time.  You do realize this whole month is nothing but E-Rock attention, right?  Leave off the last D for dumpy.  All right, let's try another one. 
[01:10:30]  80s New Wave Tuesday.  It's a remake.  Yeah.  I know this one, too.  Tom Jones.  They should have put a little more reverb and echo on the vocals.  It's a Willie Nelson remake, obviously.  All right, well. 
[01:11:00]  Who was it?  I don't know who this is.  Pet Shop Boys.  Pet Shop Boys.  Oh, yeah.  How about another one?  Jesus.  Eric.  I kind of want one that I have to think about.  Da, da, da.

This is Da, Da, Da by the band.  Did you have it out there?  Did you?  Trio.  Yes.  Very good.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  It's Opie and Anthony.  And this bit continues.  Mother, do you think they'll drop the bomb? 
[01:12:30]  That's today's Pink Floyd line.  Don't ask.  Let's say hi to Andrea.  She's been waiting a long time to kind of say this.  Andrea, what's up?  Well, my brother is a rugby player.  He's got his friends.  They're all football players.  He says he's straight.  He went to school, plays rugby.  His best friend since high school made him a hemp ankle bracelet with a bead, a wooden bead around it. 
[01:13:00]  And he wears it proudly to school through everything.  He goes out to shows like Avenue Q with him.  He streaks with the whole rugby team.  I mean, it's not normal.  Wait, he wears an ankle bracelet that he got from another guy?  His best friend.  He's like, oh, my friend made it for me.  I got an ankle bracelet from my friend. 
[01:13:30]  I'm sure that's not like a certain type of ring with like a man of leather with a button on the end of it that he got in an adult bookstore to help a gentleman.  Help a gentleman alone.  Wow.  Well, yeah, I think he might have a man crush.  A man crush.  Andrea loves it, though. 
[01:14:00]  All right, Andrea.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There you go.  Let's say how to Max in Dallas, a faithful listener of the Opian Anthony Show.  Yes.  What's up, Max?  Good morning, fellas.  Hey.  I'm going to say leave off the last D for diet.  It's year October, so it's open season.  I know.  With diet, that'd be leave off the last D for don't.  I love how Jimmy's like...  It's like, sorry.  Doesn't feel good about it.  I'm sorry, Eric. 
[01:14:30]  I'm just...  No offense.  I'm just being part of E-Rocktober.  I'm just being nutty.  I mean, Eric's a very sensitive guy.  Yeah.  He's not a punching bag.  I see him fetal position weeping by the end of Rocktober.  Oh, no kidding.  E-Rocktober.  Hey, 1943 Guide to Hiring Women.  Final.  Yes.  This is an actual excerpt from the July 1943 issue of Transportation Magazine.  I've been watching the PBS special series by Ken Burns, The War. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  About World War II.  And part of that is the women going to work.  Because the guys are all shipping off to kill the Nazis and the Japs.  And the women had to be on the home front and they took over the factory jobs.  So when that happened, it was kind of the first time the women really entered the workplace on this kind of a level.  And I guess the guys figured it's time to put together some rules and some ideas to better have women around and just better utilize them, better keep them happy. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah.  Things like that.  Because they're not like men, the women.  They need special care.  Basically, they're saying in this guide that they were forced to hire women.  They were forced.  Because the men are at war.  They're at war.  So you got to hire a few skirts. 
[01:16:00]  When the men are fighting the Nazi menace, who's on the home front?  Building the machines of war.  It's the women.  Rosie the Riveter.  Here putting the last finishing touches on a B-17.  Uh-oh.  She's on her...  I don't know if I could say that.  Seems she's dropped a...  In the...  Fuel tank.  No one understood what I was saying.  I thought I had to peep out the word tampon. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, really?  Of course I don't.  This is great.  Eleven tips on getting...  First, it has to be invented.  Yeah.  What a douche.  Women, they're not just for procreating anymore.  They're in the workplace.  Here are eleven helpful tips.  This is what's subject of...  Yeah, hiring women and having women on the job. 
[01:17:00]  Well, this was in a magazine.  I love this line.  There's no longer any question whether transit companies should hire women for jobs formerly held by men.  The draft and manpower shortage have settled that point.  Yes.  The important things now are to select the most efficient women available and how to use them to the best advantage.  Yeah, some women better than others.  Starts with this.  Pick young married women.  They usually have more of a sense of responsibility than their unmarried sisters.  Unmarried sisters. 
[01:17:30]  They're less likely to be flirtatious.  They need the work or they wouldn't be doing it.  They still have the pep and interest to work hard and to deal with the public efficiently.  The pep and interest, why the single ones are out just tying one on at night?  Yeah, just whoring around, not doing their jobs.  Yeah.  I'd like some customer service.  I'm single.  Taking care of our boys.  We're going to have to go ADD here.

Yeah, bromance is-  Bromance?  Yeah, that's another term that's being thrown around these days in the homo culture that  we're talking about today.  The bromance.  Why don't you explain the bromance there, Doug?  All right, well, you have a group of friends.  You know, you hang out with your guy friends.  Then there's always like that one friend that can't go anywhere else without that other 
[01:18:30]  guy around.  Like, you get so uncomfortable without him.  Bromance.  Yeah, it's called the bromance.  That's very bromantic.  So if you guys work together, is that like a bro job?  Yeah, exactly.  E-Rock, what's the definition of bromance?  You're over there.  You got it on the Urban Dictionary.  It says it describes the complicated love and affection shared by two straight males.  Can you not read it in the radio voice?  Describes it.  You made the idea. 
[01:19:00]  Two straight males.  Hi.  Hi.  It's E-Rock-tober.  Now I'm going to describe to you a bromance.  That's right.  Normally two straight men.  What's the definition?  Describes the...

Hey.  Hey, the rugby player with the ankle bracelet...  Yeah.  ...it starts with an ankle bracelet, Bob will get you 20, and it ends in a pearl necklace. 
[01:20:30]  Hey.  There you go.  There you go.  Very funny.  For their bromance.  All right, 11 helpful tips on the subject of hiring women from 1943.  What's number two there, Anthony?  When you have to use older women, try to get ones who have worked outside the home at some  time in their lives.  Older women who have never contacted the public have a hard time adapting themselves and are 
[01:21:00]  inclined to be cantankerous and fuzzy.  It's always well to impress upon older women the importance of friendliness and courtesy.  They're just old, grouchy bags.  Old housewife, bitchy woman.  Yeah.  They've just been beaten by their husband.  They're bitter.  She's cantankerous and fussy.  Cantankerous and fussy.  E-Rock, can we get the definition of cantankerous?  What's the definition of cantankerous, E-Rock? 
[01:21:30]  E-Rock and roll radio.  All right, he's typing in.  Come on.  He's looking for dictionary.com, D-I-K-T.  D-I-C-K-N.  Cantankerous.  Someone spelt it differently.  Cantankerous.  They've spelt it.  They put a U in somewhere. 
[01:22:00]  Oopsie.  All right.  Anything E-Rock yet?  All right.  When you got it, is this?  Maybe you could spell cantankerous.  There you go, E-Rock, right there.  Right in front of you.  No results found.  Right there.  He's spelt it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  No results found.  You got it right there.  He spelled it cantacerous.  Dude, you got it right there.  Cantacerous.  C-A-N-T.  Dictionary suggestions on the left side.  The second one down.  That's cantankerous. 
[01:22:30]  Down.  There's a K in it, E-Rock.  All right.  Here we go.  What's the definition of cantankerous?  Go ahead, E-Rock.  There's no definition here.  You're as dumb as they come.  Oh, my God.  All right.  Forget it.  I could tell E-Rock just wants to be inside the inner circle.  And it's just not panning out.  He spelled cantancerous.  He spelled it.  C-A-N-T.  Who would know how to spell cantankerous?  I got to stick up for the kids. 
[01:23:00]  C-A-N-T.  I'm not looking.  I'm not looking.  Oh, all right.  See, Andy, A-N-K-E-R-O-U-S.  All right.  Very good.  I could have been off by an A or an E, but you put an O-U in there.  Let's say hi to Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey, there, Mike.  Starts with rugby, ends with rug burn.  There you go.  Ill-tempered or quarrelsome?  Ill-tempered?  Yes.  Are they ill-tempered? 
[01:23:30]  Ill-tempered and...  Ill-tempered.  E-Rock, the official definition of...  Uh...  Cantankerous.  Cantankerous.  Yes.  Ill-tempered and quarrelsome.  Disagreeable.  Disliked her cantankerous landlord.  Difficult to handle.  Had to use liquid helium, which is super cold, costly, and...  Cantankerous.  Oh, geez.  Okay.  Okay.  No wonder he couldn't spell it.  He can't say it. 
[01:24:00]  Cantankerous.  All right.  One more time.  Difficult to handle.  Had to use liquid helium, which is super cold, costly, and cantankerous.  That was...  Good.  We should get rolling in here.  Cantankerous.  Cantankerous.  Cantankerous.  Hey, can't say it.  Can't say it.  Not good.  Not good.  Not going to work here no more.  11 helpful tips on hiring women from the year 1943.  Yes.  How about the next one there, Ant? 
[01:24:30]  General experience indicates that husky girls, those who are just a little on the heavy  side, are more even-tempered and efficient than their underweight sisters.  In other words, fat bitches try harder.  Oh, boy, do they.  It's been a staple even since the 40s.  We all know they try harder.  Hire a gregarious fat pig to do the office work.  Exactly.  You want a fatty around, she won't attract the attention of the men walking around the 
[01:25:00]  office either.  General experience.  Yes.  Husky.  Retain a physician.  This is number four.  Yep.  To give each woman you hire a special physical examination.  One covering female conditions.  This step not only protects the property against the possibilities of lawsuit, wow, back then,  but reveals whether the employee-to-be has any female weaknesses, which would make her  mentally or physically unfit for the job. 
[01:25:30]  They're basically saying, make sure you don't hire any pregnant bitches.  Yeah, that or...  That's the weakness right there.  A lot of hormone problems, ones that might have, when they have their period, they get  really, really sick or cranky.  That cuts down on production.  A bit on the, you know, side.  They suggested you test them every morning.  When they come in, is you lay down a white linen and you have them do jumping jacks over  it.  You could tell who's going home that day. 
[01:26:00]  What kind of mood she's in.  It's like a paintball accident.  All right, where's, uh, number five?  Yes, stress at the outset the importance of time.  The fact that a minute or two lost here or there makes serious inroads on schedules.  Until this point has gotten across, service is likely to be slowed up.  Women don't know things like minutes.  Stress the importance of time.  Because they're all, you know, around the house when they're just taking care of the kids. 
[01:26:30]  It doesn't matter.  A minute here, a minute there.  They could sit down, do whatever they want, and then get back to it.  But on the job, you know, you've got to be right there.  Dumb whores just fumble around making bundt cakes and little lemon cookies.  They don't know any better.  Of course not.  They don't know the clocks are ticking and time is money.  They just dotter around the house in a skirt.  Mom's apron teehee.  Bunch of diapers changing dopes.  That's really great.  Let's say hi to Pete and, uh, PA. 
[01:27:00]  Pete, what's up?  Hi, guys.  Hey.  It's Pete from Morningside here.  I'm right on.  What's up, bro?  Uh, I wanted to give an E-Rocktober rock scream.  An E-Rocktober rock scream.  It is rock scream Tuesday.  Wow.  We haven't gotten the rock scream out of the way today yet, so here we go.  E-Rocktober rock scream.  In honor of E-Rocktober.  All right.  Here we go.  E-Rocktober!  There you go.  I like that.  It went and started high, stayed high. 
[01:27:30]  Well, that's, uh, you know, the whole rock scream is going away because everyone's doing  the exact same one.  Yeah.  You gotta, like, uh, do it a little different now.  Yeah.  I got a, um, I got an E-Rocktober rock scream.  All right.  He's in an arena and all the cigarette lighters just go out to dead silence. 
[01:28:00]  They light torches with him and try to burn him.  All right.  Uh, moving on here.  We've had a higher way back in 1943.  Yes.  Number six.  Give the female employees a definite day-long schedule of duties so that they'll keep busy  without bothering the management for instructions every few minutes.  This rules.  Numerous properties say that women make excellent workers when they have their jobs cut out for 
[01:28:30]  them, but that they lack initiative to find work themselves.  You have to tell, you have to tell this robotic ox what to do or she won't know.  She'll just dot her about stupidly.  Every second, write down a schedule that has everything she's got to do with minutes so  that she could keep doing it and not come running back and go, I'm done.  What do you want me to do now? 
[01:29:00]  She'll run back every few minutes, like with her, probably with her hands flailing.  Yeah.  Her dress blowing behind her.  Oh, boss, I finished the last thing you gave me.  Now I have no idea what to do.  How the F can you do that voice?  I don't know.  It's one of those women's 40 voices.  Do it again.  Do it again.  Boss, I seem to have finished the job you gave me.  Now I don't know what else to do.  Oh, my God.  I'm just a stupid broad.  Shows up to work with her stupid apron and her oven mitts.  She doesn't know any better.  Oven mitts. 
[01:29:30]  She has oven mitts at work.  You have to tell her to take the oven mitts off.  Otherwise, she'll try to type with them.  Dude, why are we missing the obvious?  Thank God for the listeners.  Oh, Smokezilla.  Thank you.  From Kentucky.  He writes, you guys should implement some of these tips in E-Rock's daily duty.  It wouldn't make them a better worker.  Oh, kittens were on chill TV. 
[01:30:00]  Number seven.  Whenever possible, let the inside employee change from one job to another at some time during the day.  Women are inclined to be less nervous and happier with change.  Oh, she gets all frightened when it's all the same.  Yeah, it's the same thing every day.  Well, again, I guess they're like animals where they need like different colors flashing in front of them and they can continue.  Yes.  Otherwise, they'll just stand there and flap their stupid woman arms. 
[01:30:30]  They get bored.  Yes.  Don't forget to walk your woman twice a day or she may poop on herself.  Point out where the bathroom is so she doesn't use the welcome mat.  We've had instances of women urinating in bomb casings.  Have a rolled up newspaper to straighten her out in case she barks when customers come in. 
[01:31:00]  Number eight.  It starts getting really good at the end here.  Give every girl an adequate number of rest periods during the day.  You have to make some allowances for feminine psychology.  A girl has more confidence and is more efficient if she can keep her hair tidied, apply fresh lipstick, and wash her hands several times a day.  Oh, that's hilarious.  She'll feel better.  She's a rest period.  Take a nap, dunce. 
[01:31:30]  She's got to put her makeup on, wash her hands.  She's afraid of a little dirt.  Don't do your lipstick, stupid.  Take five.  Don't smoke a Benson Hedges and do your lipstick.  Number nine.  Be tactful when issuing instructions or in making criticisms.  Women are often sensitive.  They can't shrug off harsh words the way men do.  Never ridicule a woman.  It breaks her spirit and cuts off her efficiency. 
[01:32:00]  Breaks her spirit.  It's like when you beat a dog too much.  Yeah.  They get all, you know, tail between the legs and they get all scared.  Kevin from Connecticut.  Tip number nine.  Terminate the woman's employment as soon as she shows any sign of a baby bump.  And they also discourage you where she's caught locked up humping that you're not supposed  to squirt cold water at her from a little water gun. 
[01:32:30]  If she, if her spirit's broken, you'll have to ship her off to the glue factory.  Number 10.  If she falls down, set her leg and don't let her walk on it.  Oh boy.  Get ready to look up another word there, Iraq.  Is it number 10?  Yep.  Be reasonable, reasonably considerate about using strong language around women.  Even though a girl's husband or father may swear vociferously. 
[01:33:00]  Vociferously.  Vociferously.  She'll grow to dislike a place of business where she hears too much of this.  How do you swear vociferously?  Vociferously.  Vociferously.  I'm going to guess it's frequently or aggressively.  Don't call her f*** or f*** or f*** or f*** or f*** or f*** or f*** or useless piece  of f*** or just a life support system for a f***. 
[01:33:30]  What's vociferously?  Yeah.  Crying out noisily, clamorous.  Is there more?  Characterized by or uttered with.  Go ahead.  You can do it.  Sound it out.  Vociferation.  I'm almost.  Voice of a f***?  I'm actually, you're so dumb, I'm afraid for you.  You're not going to make it to the end of October with this year October, man. 
[01:34:00]  Okay, try it again.  Truth number two.  All right.  Characterized by or uttered with vociferation.  Vociferation.  No, vociferation.  Vociferation.  Exactly.  It's when you mumble through words and use the wrong stuff.  I didn't do that right either.  It's characterized by or uttered with vociferation.  A vociferous manner or expression. 
[01:34:30]  Of expression.  I don't know what that means.  All right.  Okay.  Moving on.  Don't drop the C-bomb.  The last.  We're here to drop the A-bomb, not the C-bomb.  The last tip to hiring a woman from the year 1943.  Get enough size variety in operators' uniforms so that each girl can have a proper fit.  This point can't be stressed too much in keeping women happy.  They don't want to walk around looking baggy in their coveralls. 
[01:35:00]  They have to be form-fitting.  No nice, slender girl wants to look like a fatty.  We're also saying that the breasts will bulge it out if the uniform is too small and make it uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got to leave room for the boobies.  Of course.  There you go.  For that rack breathing room.  That is some funny stuff right there.  Oh.  That's very, very good.  And if she doesn't listen, they suggest that you type out the instructions on your fist and dole them out. 
[01:35:30]  This will also teach the other girls.  That's right.  Not to f*** around.  Oh, I'm being voicificatious.  Yes, voicificatious.  Remember, a black guy is also, and then in quotes, a lesson teacher.  Hey, I was just thinking about stuff lying around.  Yeah.  I was just thinking about that.  You know, if you have a bunch of crap lying around your place that you don't want or need, some old concert t-shirts, CDs you never play, and perhaps even some gold or jewelry. 
[01:36:00]  Well, the rest of that stuff is probably worthless.  You could pick up some cash by sending all that unwanted jewelry off to cashforgold.com.  Yeah.  What is this internet they speak of?  I don't know.  But you'd take over.  Oh, all right.  I do know.  Just click on cashforgold.com.  That's cash, the number four, gold.com.

[01:37:00]  Cashforgold.com.  It's 80s, New Wave Tuesday.  You got another song?  Yeah.  You got to figure out who does this song as we go to break.  Why are we playing songs no one knows?  Missing Persons?  Yeah, but Missing Persons have, like, Walking in L.A. 
[01:37:30]  This is like an obscure Missing Persons song.  Who's picking these?  E-Rock.  It's E-Rock-tober.  The bit is you got to keep everyone involved.  No one knows that song.  If you want to hear Missing Persons, you do Walking in L.A.  Yeah.  What was the other one?  Sounded just like Walking in L.A.  Yeah.  You're a vociferous ass.  Oh, my God, man.  I got an easy one.  Not necessarily an easy one, but if you're going to play Missing Persons, you got to kind 
[01:38:00]  of play the hit.  All right.  Do another one.  I'm doing all right, getting good grades.  The future's so bright.  I got a weird shade.  It's a guy's name, right?  I got a weird shade.  No, it's a band?  I thought it was just a guy's name.  I got a job waiting for my graduation.  Fifty dollar year, I'll buy a lot of beer.  Things are going great.  And they're only getting better. 
[01:38:30]  I'm doing all right.  I hate this song.  Someone's suggesting it's Dire Straits.  It's not Dire Straits.  Oh, there.  Sounds a little bit like Mark Knopf.  All right.  There you go.  Who does that song?  We'll tell you after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  I'm doing all right.  Getting good grades.  The future's so bright.  I got a weird shade.  Yeah.  New Wave Tuesday.  I got a weird shade.  Did he get that one?  I got a job.  I didn't. 
[01:39:00]  I didn't either.  I looked at somebody's submission on PalTalk, and they were right.  They got on instant feedback, too.  And I went like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  That's Timbuk3.  That's funny, because it's supposed to be like Timbuk2, but they're Timbuk3.  Basically saying, you know, nuclear war rocks.  Is that it?  Yeah.  I didn't get the message.  That's why I need the shades.  It's so bright out there, because of all the nuclear bombs going off.  They were pretty scared of that crap back then. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Never really panned out the big kaboom.  Hey, we got a couple things.  We got our News Tease special.  The Hidden Danger News Tease special.  And we also have an elementary school in L.A.  I'm assuming that would be Louisiana.  Oh, or Los Angeles.  I don't think it's Los Angeles.  Elementary school and, oh, Grandling?  That's Louisiana.  Oh.  What happened?  Well, Jimmy, they're teaching kids about racism with nooses and shekels. 
[01:40:00]  Oh.  Okay.  They took a different approach to this whole racism thing.  Instead of just kind of sitting down and conversing about it, they brought in props.  Yeah.  It's a prop teacher.  Yeah.  As thousands of civil rights protesters descended on Jenna, Louisiana, elementary school children  and close-by Grambling were asking about racism.  That's according to the Grambling State University student-run newspaper, The Gramblingite. 
[01:40:30]  During the lesson, teachers from the University of J. Brown Elementary School placed a noose  around one child's neck, allowed children to carry shackles and chains, and lifted up  this girl.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And by the way, don't laugh at me today.  Grambling.  It says Grambling on the desk.  Ah.  Grambling.  Grambling.  There you go.  Well, that's how they're teaching racism in that elementary school. 
[01:41:00]  It's also a good way to discipline unruly children.  It is regrettable and unfortunate that the elementary school supervisors allowed students  at these grade levels to be participants in an activity which is not a part of the curriculum  and which had not been properly reviewed.  The publication of the photograph of the child with a noose around her neck dramatized an irresponsible  act. 
[01:41:30]  Judson ordered the photos be removed, but the newspaper's editor refused.  Henry says he decided to take the photos down after readers complained they were offensive  and not because Judson ordered them removed.  You know what?  We wonder why you're pumping out just a nation of sissies and little robotic thinking douches  because every time a teacher tries some kind of an initiative that is different, that is 
[01:42:00]  somehow outside of the box, people snivel and bellyache.  They freak out.  Yeah.  And you know what?  Maybe that wasn't that bad of a thing.  I'm sure he didn't parade the kid around with a noose.  He was probably saying this is one of the awful things people did.  And she, I'm sure it was nowhere near as bad as they're painting it.  But you, stop wondering why your kids are just a bunch of little, a bunch of little robotic  dummies.  Yeah, they, they, it worked.  It worked though, Jimmy.  Well, the kid who gets the noose around the neck, obviously the parents are going to be 
[01:42:30]  like, they did what?  They did what to you?  It was nothing.  They were just kind of showing and, oh, got to make a big stink about it.  Yeah.  Every time you try to do something a little outside the box as a, as a teacher, the school,  some stupid parent complains and the school board comes down on you and you have to stop  and obey the curriculum, which is, which is in many cases, just garbage.  Crap.  Of course.  To just pump them through.  Hopefully they'll graduate and spit out the other end to be just worthless. 
[01:43:00]  People are making the observation that it sounds like Carrot Top is teaching, you know.  Yeah.  The prop, the prop teachers.  Racism Awareness there, down there in Louisiana.  All right.  There you go.  That's something that's happening down there.  And we got our News Tease Hidden Danger Special.  We love the News Teases.  We haven't done it in quite a long time.  The news, you know, their whole job is to scare the crap out of you.  So you watch their dumb news program or what's perceived as news. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  Especially locally, they're not doing news anymore.  News-ertainment.  News-ertainment there?  News-ertainment is what it's called.  Seriously?  Yeah.  They're actually changing it?  No, people that are critical of it call it news-ertainment.  Right.  Because it's not really news.  And we notice patterns.  And Danny put together this News Tease Hidden Danger Special.  Yeah.  It's sort of a different take on the News Teases we do.  But I guess the news learns what some of these words are that will get you to watch. 
[01:44:00]  These little catchphrases.  Catchphrases.  Thank you, Ed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That you hear.  And it makes you go like, what?  You turn your head around and go, what?  What?  What?  What was that that I just heard?  They know.  They're key words.  Like Pavlov's dog.  You'll turn around and start looking and drooling and want dog food.  And one of the new ones is Hidden Danger.  Pavlov.  You use that on your local news or your national news and people are going to have to watch.  People are afraid of Hidden Dangers.  And there's Hidden Dangers in everything.  Caught on camera tonight, a hidden danger that may be in your child's playground. 
[01:44:30]  Uncle Paul.  Yeah, I was just looking at that.  Careful, kids.  Might fall down and skin your knee.  I'll kiss it all better.  Yeah, no.  You need little kisses.  Keeps your skin nice and tender.  That is the creepiest.  I'm with your chick, man.  It really is.  That just, like, gets my freaking...  Awful.  She handles it, though.  She brings in Vera, who loves Paul, and Paul hates me. 
[01:45:00]  Because Vera's just an old bag.  Oh, Uncle Paul, you're divine.  You're divine.  Drop dead, Vera.  You're old.  Yeah, it's really weird.  We argue in character.  It's fun.  You're a fun girl.  Don't talk too much about your girlfriend.  I know I'm obsessed.  Oh, right.  Yeah, there's a guy out there that can't stand when you talk about your girlfriend.  So there you go.  Hidden danger.  That's the catchphrase that they're using on the news.  And there's a hidden danger in your playground.  Do we need the answer, really?  What is it?  Well, I'd kind of like to know what that one is, yeah.  We want to scare some parents out there. 
[01:45:30]  There's actually...  You know how some playgrounds use those foam mats to shield your kid from the cement?  And others use...  There's that one school that's using the mats, but with crushed glass on them.  Yeah.  Well, some other playgrounds use wood chips.  And apparently there's some kind of wood chips that could actually spontaneously combust.  Shut up.  It burst...  Yeah, no.  They actually had a security camera...  Could have happened once in the history of man.  Well, probably.  But they had security camera footage of this playground just going up in flames out of nowhere.  How could wood just spontaneously combust? 
[01:46:00]  Like the air has to be just right and, you know, has to be on fire.  And the wood chips had to be packed just so and...  See, this is the problem with the news.  This is one of these extremely rare things that could possibly happen.  Like one in a million.  And now they make it like every playground is in danger of this happening.  Do your children live within 20 miles of the sun?  Hidden danger.  Wood chips.  Yep, wood chips.  Going up in flames.  I wouldn't have picked that one.  No.  I thought, you know, the old monkey bars. 
[01:46:30]  Remember that?  You won't find those on there.  No.  No playgrounds anymore.  And seesaws.  Monkey bars are the best.  You don't even really see a seesaw anymore.  Seesaw, the enemy of the fat pig.  Too much for...  I'm sorry.  Nothing tortures a fat kid like the sight of a seesaw.  Just the dreams that will never be attained.  Can't play.  When you had to lift the seesaw up and put it over two notches.  Yeah.  So the heavier side would be on yours.  There were adjustable seesaws.  That you could...  Oh, yeah. 
[01:47:00]  They were like little notches that the seesaw rested on.  And if you were both the same weight, you would put it in the middle notch.  And then if you were on with a fatty, you would slide it over.  And then you would get on the side that was slid over a little more.  So you'd have a little more, you know, leverage there.  It's like, hey, everybody, can you help me adjust the seesaw?  Fatty wants a turn.  And then when you get fatty up in the air...  Then you kind of step off.  Then you step off and watch him crash on his ass.  Because kids weren't too smart to just put their feet down and let the seesaw fall to the ground between their feet. 
[01:47:30]  They would stay there and fall right on their ass.  And it would really hurt your tailbone.  They got rid of the seesaw because too much responsibility for the little tots.  Yeah.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because people didn't know how to work them right.  Everyone was always stepping off them when you were up top.  Yeah.  Get ahead there, Thin.  It was just the thing to do.  Yeah.  Or if you were the heavier person, you could strand a kid up there.  Oh, yeah.  That was always a good one, too.  Yeah.  They would get off and stand on it.  Like, step on it with one foot and go, I'm just going to let go.  I'm just going to let go and let me down. 
[01:48:00]  Dan, how's mother?  Oh, have you spoken with mother?  Couldn't tell you.  Oh, good.  True.  All right, good.  Speaking of emotional seesaws.  All right, here's another.  Monkey bars were great, too, that you don't see that anymore.  Because that was like just, we'll build something so that if you fall off of it, you don't just hit the ground,  but you could break every single bone on the way down.  Oh, you're not talking about the parallel monkey bars?  No, this is monkey bars like it was a square.  It was just all full of bars. 
[01:48:30]  Yeah, it was just bars crossed members inside, and then it narrowed out a little at the top to a smaller set of monkey bars.  But if you fell through that thing, you were cracking your head, your shoulders, everything.  You don't see those anymore.  All right, here we go.  Another hidden danger.  On the broadcast tonight, there's news about those dangerous toys.  We're learning the lead paint problem is worse than we first thought.  And our health series tonight, the hidden danger of high school sports. 
[01:49:00]  Nightly news is straight ahead.  What the hell is the hidden danger of high school sports?  I would say breaking your neck, probably.  Nope.  It's not exactly hidden.  You're pushing that lump around for the rest of his life.  It's pretty obvious.  Nope, I know what it is.  A staph infection from moist jock straps.  Oh.  It's a danger, not sexy.  That's true.  At night, people were breaking in and eating potato salad out of the jocks of the superior athletes. 
[01:49:30]  And the residue was causing infections.  Anything with a cup-like shape, Jimmy's eating potato salad out of...  Potato salad is a thick, very, very forgiving, yet moldable food, as we all know.  I just love you.  You've eaten potato salad out of...  Hats.  Hats.  Wigs.  Wigs.  The guy's hair at the Parker.  Oh, that old walkhead. 
[01:50:00]  God bless his soul.  What is her?  Whatever it is.  Whatever it is.  A cancer survivor's bra.  Someone's got to make a list out there.  You've eaten potato salad out of just about everything.  And now, infected jock straps.  I think Heather Mills' leg.  Yeah, Heather Mills' leg.  I've actually spilled out rare marmalades.  And tipped the prosthetic up.  Rare marmalades?  Yes, rare marmalades imported.  Rare marmalades.  Like, I've packed her prosthetic full of rare, spicy orange marmalades, and I've eaten them. 
[01:50:30]  Good for you.  Why do they still make orange marmalade?  Marmalade.  Go to a diner, and that's all they've got left for your toast is orange marmalade.  Marmalade?  Who eats that crap?  It really is awful.  There's some stuff we've got to just retire.  Orange marmalade is one of them.  And it's been around forever.  There are things that have just been around forever that have to go.  And you're right.  I think marmalade is one of them.  I'd rather have leukemia butter. 
[01:51:00]  So, I'm going to go with some kind of fungus.  Served in a toupee.  Yes.  And just thrown on you.  Any other answers?  Real answers?  For the hidden danger?  It's probably some kind of an infection you can get from the locker room.  I'm going to guess something like that.  Hidden danger?  I'm going with a fungus.  In sports?  Fungus, fungus, fungus.  Oh, I'd say some type of medical condition that the child has that isn't looked into. 
[01:51:30]  You were closest.  Wait, wait, wait.  I want to guess another one.  Okay.  Fungus or pine cones?  Pine cones.  Pine cones.  Where Emilio Estevez comes in and puts tape on your ass and rips your ass hair off.  Like you talked about at the breakfast club.  Who didn't drop a tear?  I challenge you.  Judd Nelson was dangerous.  Oh, boy, was he?  Oh, look out for him.  Just like high school.  Oh, wow.  He's going to take one for the team.  Yeah. 
[01:52:00]  Go ahead.  What about you?  Yeah.  Dad.  All that drama.  Oh, way too much dumb drama.  Never happened.  They'll all just be sitting there quiet.  Of course they will.  People, a couple of them would say something stupid.  Time would go by and you'd leave.  All right.  Somebody would gas.  They'd all giggle.  They'd hate each other as much.  All right.  The two would come in.  Everyone would be scared.  What's the hidden danger?  No one's brave.  Well, Ant was more, he was closest with his answer on the first one when he was talking 
[01:52:30]  about breaking his neck.  It's actually, the hidden danger is concussions.  Because if you are playing, I guess, high school football and you have too many concussions  that could lead to some serious health concerns later in life.  You'll get a conclusion of the brain.  So I don't think that's quite so hidden.  No, of course not.  No.  Everyone knows that.  Hidden danger.  Here we go.  My ass.  The next one.  Coming up on the ABC7 News at noon, they're supposed to help you get healthy and feel  better.  But could vitamins that have antioxidants have a hidden danger? 
[01:53:00]  See, there's that catchphrase.  Have a hidden danger.  Hidden danger?  Oh, these news.  It's dangerous.  They're hiding now.  What's wrong with the antioxidants?  Yeah, what happened?  What happened with that one?  What happened, Danny?  What happened?  Well, just as with anything else, too much of, I guess, one thing could be not good for  you.  So I guess they've had these long-term studies now with people who are taking antioxidants,  and there are certain antioxidants that can increase certain health risks. 
[01:53:30]  One example that they gave was lung cancer.  Good luck, bro.  They just say certain antioxidants will give you a higher risk of lung cancer.  I will tell you about that.  Yeah.  Why couldn't they?  Why did they have to tease the hidden danger?  Because they need...  Hidden danger.  They need you to linger longer.  A hidden danger.  Look out.  All right.  We got a few more examples of this after the break, but it is New Wave Tuesday, and it's  also a far-away phone call Tuesday.  We haven't gotten our far-away phone call yet tonight. 
[01:54:00]  What else have we missed out on?  We did rock screen.  Hummer Tuesday.  The lawyers took that one away from us.  It was one of our great staples on the OPNA show.  Of course they did, because that's what they give to each other in the office, instead  of fighting for the radio show.  What do you think?  Habeas corpus.  Just say Rittigan.  Just jiggle them and say Ritt.  Ritt.  You got a song for the break there, E-Rock?  Let's not forget, it's E-Rocktober as well. 
[01:54:30]  More on that, hopefully, by tomorrow.  Sure is.  All right.  Let's go.  Let's go.  After the break, we'll tell you who does this song.  You got it?  I know the song.  I don't think I got it.  I know the song.  You got it, Jimmy?  I don't know.  Oh, they ruined it for me.  Yeah, now I know it.  I do. 
[01:55:00]  I love the internet, how everyone thinks they're geniuses on the internet.  When you post the correct answer to something, you just look it up.  You can look anything up now.  I know the song with Major Tom in it.  Yeah.  It's Major Tom.  Yeah, Major Tom again.  You can rip them off.  Earth below us drifting. 
[01:55:30]  Did the song really need a sequel?  All right.  We'll tell you who does this after the break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's 80s New Wave Tuesday on the Opie and Anthony show.  Kind of just an excuse to have Club Soda Kenny and Roland and Steve sing bad versions of 80s songs. 
[01:56:00]  Horrid 80s songs.  Gutshot Drew from Howl.  Howl.  He's got the group that sang that song you're listening to there.  Mm-hmm.  It was done by Never Got Laid Till I Joined a Band.  Now I'm Exploring My Bisexual Side Band.  Actually, did you get it, Ant?  No, I didn't.  But again, I saw it on the Pal Talk text.  Yeah, it's Peter Schilling.  Yes.  One-hit wonder from Peter Schilling. 
[01:56:30]  Peter Schilling later going on to pitch for the Red Sox.  Oh, wait a minute.  That would be his son.  No, Anthony, that's Kurt.  Ha, ha, ha.  Anthony.  I believe that's Kurt Schilling.  Gentlemen.  Gentlemen.  Sadie's New Wave Tuesday.  Come on, let's go for me.  Do you really want to hurt me?  Do you really want to make me cry? 
[01:57:00]  I am serious.  And don't call me Shirley.  Oh, house.  In the middle of our street.  Oh, house.  In the middle of our street.  Don't you want me, baby?  Don't you want me?  Oh.  It's Sadie's New Wave Tuesday.  On the L.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh.  I love it.  Favorite part. 
[01:57:30]  I don't know.  Our house.  Our house.  In the middle of the street.  Our house.  And we make Tim.  Rolling.  We make Tim do a new one every week.  And this is today.  Shall we play a game?  That's Sadie's New Wave Tuesday.  The world was moving.  The air with it.  And she was.  Shy, shy.  Hush, hush.  I do I.  You're too shy, shy.  Hush, hush.  I do I.  Oh, I need to hear some tasty waves. 
[01:58:00]  Cool buzz.  And I'm fine.  And I run.  I run so far away.  Ha, purple.  I just run.  I run both night and day.  I couldn't get away.  He's been away on Tuesday.  Yeah, Roland, you're the star this week.  I love that one, Roland.  Yeah, week one it might have been Club Soda Candy.  But no, because you did the house.  Yeah, you're a star there, Roland. 
[01:58:30]  What did I tell you?  I like that one.  Roland is great.  Thanks.  Thank you so much for the War DVD collection.  I've got the whole thing.  That is fantastic.  I didn't have to wait.  I don't have to go through my DVR or nothing.  I don't have to wait through public television.  Or pay $150 for them.  Or pay $150 to get the DVD.  Do you like it?  It is so good.  Ken Burns is ridiculous at making documentaries.  I don't know why they're so good, like his documentaries. 
[01:59:00]  You know, you film some stuff.  You get some archive footage.  You get some photographs.  But he, like, personalizes this stuff.  So instead of just showing, like, World War II footage, he takes how four towns in America dealt with World War II and has interviews with people that are still alive, that were on the home front, that were overseas.  And it really personalizes the people he's talking about so that when you find out somebody, you go through their whole story, and then you find out during that episode of the documentary that the guy gets killed. 
[01:59:30]  Or sometimes he doesn't get killed.  But you don't know.  Like, he's sending letters back, and they're reading the letters that he was sending back.  There's this one guy that's just writing these letters back saying, nothing's happening.  I'm so bored.  And meanwhile, he's in the middle of combat.  They're sending him to horrid places.  And he kept writing to his family, like, no, I haven't seen any action.  Why did you do that?  Just to keep him calm until his sister is writing him a letter about his birthday. 
[02:00:00]  Hey, happy 21st birthday.  He's 21 years old.  Happy 21st birthday.  I hope you're having a good time and everything.  And they get the telegram, find out that he died six days before his 21st birthday.  So she's writing this letter to him, and he's already dead.  Wow.  It was really like, whoa, holy jeez.  Is it out yet for people to buy or no?  No, it's being broadcast.  And it's a lot, you know, on public television.  How many hours is it?  It's five, I think, five two-hour episodes. 
[02:00:30]  I think it comes out like in a month.  Can I get one?  Yeah.  I'll pay for it.  It's really, really good, though.  And he makes, like, the Civil War one he did was amazing.  That one got all kinds of acclaim.  The baseball one was good.  Yeah, the baseball one was good.  I wonder if he interviewed people from the Civil War one, like Sandy Kane.  You're a prostitute on the Confederate side.  That sounds good, man.  Yeah, it's really good.  All right, Roland.  Thank you.  And thanks for the Hannah Montana tickets. 
[02:01:00]  And the Kurt Cobain.  And the Kurt Cobain, yeah.  Way to remind, subtly.  Yeah.  How about...  Hannah Montana is the ass, man.  Aren't you going to...  What happened?  I think...  Hidden Dangers?  What?  No, I'll be with something.  Hidden Dangers.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Well, we're also getting ready to play What Did We Learn on the O.B. and Anthony Show.  So if you got one, give us a call.  But I'm going to do a new segment called What the F?  I just saw a fan's note.  They kept talking about chow. 
[02:01:30]  They do.  We sat down and had chow.  What's that?  Is it good?  Oh, I like it.  I like it.  Uh-oh.  Danny's just going, I like it.  Now we got too many things going on.  No.  Remember the days we had nothing going on?  Yeah.  I like those days better.  Day before?  I can't remember.  Guess the sound.  This came in from Craig.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. 
[02:02:00]  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Wow, that is a mystery. 
[02:02:30]  That is.  There are so many little subtle things going on in there.  Can I read the answer?  I don't have it written down.  Oh, really?  Write it down real fast.  We'll tell you the answer to that tomorrow.  Do you know what it is?  I have no idea.  Wow.  Craig might have found a stumper there, right?  That's a good one.  All right.  So we got that.  We'll give you the answer to that tomorrow.  We also have more hidden danger stuff.  Maybe we'll do that tomorrow.  Yes.  Did you write something or no?  Huh?  Did you write something?  Yeah.  I want to start a new segment called What the F?  I think it's kind of cool. 
[02:03:00]  What the F?  Yeah.  What the F?  And what will that entail?  Just, you know, things that make you go, what the F?  What the F?  Yeah.  All right.  What the F is with orange artificial flavoring.  Huh.  It never tastes bad.  It always tastes like orange, no matter what product or company uses it.  Orange tastes like orange.  What the F?  It's true.  Yeah. 
[02:03:30]  Huh.  What the F is with other artificial flavors.  Oh.  Grape tastes like it.  Grape tastes like ass.  Hmm.  Unless it's in an ice pop where it tastes extremely sweet and sugary.  Oof.  Lime burns when you drink it.  Cherry tastes like bad cough syrup.  All the rest of artificial flavors naturally blow.  What the F?  What the F?  What?  What is this? 
[02:04:00]  This is kind of like Carlin, but without any good writing or comedic timing.  No.  Why are you making fun of my writing?  No, no disrespect.  What the F?  Artificial flavors.  What the F?  Why do commercials on the radio or TV about people being illiterate always say the phone  number and then spell it out?  What the F?  Hello?  These people you want to call?  Hello?  Ken Reed?  Hello?  Is it a F?  What you're saying?  Hello?  Let's spell it.  What the F?  Wait, wait.  Hello is not actually written out. 
[02:04:30]  No.  Don't tell me that there's a, like, hello?  What the F?  Why do commercials on the radio or TV about people being illiterate always say the phone  number and then spell it out?  Hello?  These people you want to call can't read what you're saying, much less spell it.  Is this?  What the F?  Is this called what the F or hello?  It's called what the F.  Is there an earth to whoever?  Like, do they do that?  Earth to Bob. 
[02:05:00]  Or how about newsflash dash?  Like newsflash with a hyphen F.  Yeah, yeah.  Newsflash.  Someone wants to guess the sound already.  Brooklyn Ace, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Is that E-Rock eating breakfast?  It is E-Rocktober.  Oh, no?  Oh, sorry.  By the way, did this turn into Pot Talk Monday all of a sudden?  Yeah, I know.  We're all over the place.  What the F?  We're very excited because we just discovered something that's going to really help E-Rocktober. 
[02:05:30]  I'm going to say right now on October 2nd that E-Rock doesn't survive E-Rocktober.  Yeah, it's so early.  And there's been so much abuse hurled his way for E-Rocktober.  We will throw a party for you, E-Rock, if you survive E-Rocktober.  I think he'll have a mental breakdown and end up running out of the studio at some point in tears.  I sincerely think that's going to happen.  That's not uncommon, though.  Eric's a sensitive boy.  He is sensitive.  Eric cries relatively easily. 
[02:06:00]  He's a sweet, sensitive, emotional kid.  E-Rock, are you enjoying the what the F bit?  Oh, thoroughly, yes.  And by the way, 80s legend from Maine, he goes,  what the F is up with this dumbass segment?  Wake me up when it's over.  Zzzz.  Did he put Z's?  I love the Z.  Or did he put the big yawn?  Sometimes with a show, you've got to wait for it.  Wait for it.  Wait for it.  If you listen to this program and you hear us doing a segment that you really think is completely out of character and lame and stupid, 
[02:06:30]  perhaps there's a reason for it.  Right.  You've got to, like, hang out for the payoff.  You can't just take everything from this show at face value.  Do you honestly think we would be doing this with the F bit?  So just relax.  I mean, aside from the obvious funny, like, observational.  Oh, well, that's what I meant.  You know, it's hysterical. 
[02:07:00]  It's what you're poking your head up over.  What the F is with SpaghettiOs?  What's the deal?  What's the deal with the sauce?  Three versions of SpaghettiOs?  Plain, hot dogs, and meatballs?  All three have different sauce.  You wouldn't know.  Plain's a bit on the bland side and thin in texture.  Hot dogs is very, very, in capital letters, thin, but mildly spicy.  Meatballs is this thick, rich sauce which fills you up before you even finish the can. 
[02:07:30]  Make a note of it.  What the F?  What the F?  I hate things that are all about the subject of food.  What the fat, this should be called.  What the F?  Oh, my God.  Oh, okay.  They've all been about some type of food. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, that's why I don't have that one.  It's amazing.  What the F is a Pokemon?  Want to catch my Pocket Monster?  Maybe it will Pikachu.  What's that?  Oh, hold on.  No, no, no, no.  I got to put my coat on.  That?  It will Pikachu?  Pikachu.  Well, the Pocket Monster and Pikachu are both characters. 
[02:08:30]  See, Pokemon is a Pocket Monster.  Yeah.  And Pikachu is a Pokemon.  So, Pocket Monster will peek at you.  It's a play on words is what it is.  Cool.  What the F?  What the F is with the video for the Christina Aguilera song, What a Girl Wants.  Notice the set?  It was taken from the 80s video for the Paula Abdul song, Cold-Hearted Snake.  What the F?  What fat girl wrote this?  Holy Jesus.  No, I don't know.  Did you?  Who noticed that? 
[02:09:00]  What type of pudgy homo would notice that?  Well, here's the big reveal.  In honor of E-Rocktober.  E-Rocktober, everybody.  The boys found one of E-Rock's old websites.  Yes.  Good old pseudo-radio.  Right, E-Rock?  Yep.  Oh, man.  Is he not in a good place?  Wait.  When did you realize that there was something you had written?  When it was what the F or what?  Yeah.  Exactly when did it hit you like, oh, my God, they found this? 
[02:09:30]  When I went into the office to try to get water, and they were all covering up really  fast whatever it is they had.  We had a pop-up.  Hold on.  We had a pop-up, just like a blanket Google screen.  We're just looking at the internet.  You know, the internet.  Google's.  We're Googling.  Listen, we're running out of show.  We wanted to play What Did We Learn on the O.P. and Anthony Show, but unfortunately,  we're running out of...  What the F?  Running out of show.  I hate that.  And here's the answer to Guess the Sound that we'll give you tomorrow. 
[02:10:00]  Read this.  All right.  No, not on the air.  I'm not reading it on the air.  I'm just saying.  It'll make you laugh, though.  That's the Guess the Sound answer.  All right.  I got to see that.  That's a video?  Yeah.  Holy Jesus.  We'll give you the answer tomorrow to this.  Who's doing this?  Also, in honor of E-Rocktober,  we're going to play What the F all day long tomorrow. 
[02:10:30]  Get your What the Fs together for tomorrow's radio show.  We got a homework assignment tonight.  No one that didn't know would guess this.  There's no way anyone's going to guess this,  unless you saw the video.  Yeah.  Now that I know.  Now that you know the answer.  Oh, Christ, that's funny.  Can I ask one question about it?  Yeah.  Is there a gentleman lying on his back? 
[02:11:00]  No.  Okay.  Oh, there's the music.  Another day of E-Rocktober.  It's only E-Rocktober 2nd.  Oh, it's only E-Rocktober 2nd.  E-Rock, are you going to hang in there or what?  Yeah.  And you know what I love about E-Rocktober?  It's got 31 days.  It's not one of those short 30-day months.  You get an extra day of E-Rocktober.  Yeah.  Lots of what the F's tomorrow, okay? 
[02:11:30]  I guess that's it for today, unfortunately.  We had a faraway phone call standing by from Afghanistan.  We never got to that.  Oh, and Fargo.  And tomorrow, don't forget, it's Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  Last week, someone did it with a stick of dynamite.  Quarter stick of dynamite.  We'll see what we get tomorrow for Wake Up Your Spouse Wednesday.  More of what the F's from E-Rock's old website.  We'll tell you what the sound is. 
[02:12:00]  We got lots to do tomorrow.  That's cool.  We're off to XM to our new studio.  That's right.  Nice.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Have a great day.  Man out.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  We're off to XM to our new studio. 
[02:12:30]  We'll see you next week. 
[02:13:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:13:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:14:00]  We'll be right back. 
[02:14:30]  We're going to go to a bit so we can restart things, and then we'll be right back with 
[02:15:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  We'll be right back. 
[02:15:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:16:00]  That's because we were trying to do the show from over here.  Yeah.  No, no.  I wasn't working over there either.  I wasn't working over there either.  No, this is the second day in the brand new state-of-the-art Opie and Anthony Studio here  at XM, and we got two sections.  We got the boring side over there, which is your standard console microphones kind of section 
[02:16:30]  that you see in most radio stations.  And then over here is kind of like a lounge area with leather couches.  Real comfy couches.  Leather chairs.  We need some leather ottomans.  An ottoman.  We need an ottoman or two.  And this is where we're going to hang when we want to do interviews and stuff.  Yeah, I think interviews would be pretty cool from here.  The guest just sits in the chairs or the couch.  We hang.  So we want to try this side out. 
[02:17:00]  You guys are so lazy, you can't even broadcast the walk anymore.  See, I put the winky face, so I was only joking.  Oh, okay.  I thought he was serious.  I was going to get very angry.  Technical difficulty.  Did E-Rock eat the board?  He wouldn't eat the board.  We were discussing E-Rocktober on the way over.  Yeah.  And we really don't think he's going to make it to the end of October.  No, I think he's going to fold.  He's going to, I think, fetal position, crying, and just leave. 
[02:17:30]  Leave the studio.  Yeah.  And we got, wow, hundreds of fans showed up today to check out the new studio.  So many that we decided we can't let anyone in.  Are they outside?  No.  The four people that did take the walk with us?  I don't know.  One was Patty.  We didn't tell them to go home, did we?  I hope not.  Yeah, Stalker Patty's out there.  Patty.  Janine's out there.  Can we go get the listeners that did the walkover?  We do have the bleachers right outside the studio here. 
[02:18:00]  We're facing the bleachers today.  There's glass in between us, a glass wall.  But if these people do the walkover,  they have to come up and check out the new facility, right?  Of course.  What happened?  Did Kenny tell them to go home?  No, they just take paperwork.  You could all just leave.  Paperwork.  Tell me Patty still has to fill out paperwork.  I don't know.  When she comes in here.  I forgot about all the old problems are now the same problems. 
[02:18:30]  Do they have to fill out paperwork over at CBS?  I guess.  They do?  Yeah, but it must be much quicker.  We also have Big A here.  People are saying my mic is fucked up.  Is it fucked up?  People are saying...  Oh, look at this anorexic on the Insider.  We got TVs everywhere.  She's got away...  60, 70 pounds.  60 pounds.  Yeah.  Oh, she's skin and bones.  She's kind of cute, though.  Ew.  Yeah.  She kind of is.  Look at her face. 
[02:19:00]  I can't tell.  She's just fucking like a cadaver.  What's she got on her?  Yeah.  Oh, they got her naked.  Oh, man.  They had to like blur out the boobie area.  Whoa, look at her collarbones.  I want to snap those.  I know.  I just want to break it like a wishbone.  I want to fuck her so hard I paralyze her.  How nice would that be to fuck somebody into the hospital?  Oh, you get like fucking spine scrape marks on your cock.  Hey, Jimmy's mic is in one channel.  Is that possible? 
[02:19:30]  I'm working on it.  They're working on it.  What's that mean, one channel?  It means you're only 50% funny today.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You got to be twice as funny now to be just as funny as you are normally.  Why is Dan Natterman hanging out on the bleachers like he's a fan?  Should we bring him in?  Of course we should.  We got Dan Natterman outside the studio.  Natterman who's a creeper.  I swear.  Here, Jimmy.  That's like fucking Wonderama.  The bleachers out there reminds me of Wonderama. 
[02:20:00]  Do you know each other, Dan?  This is Anthony.  Hello, Dan.  I haven't met.  Don't expect me to get up.  I'm now in this reclined position and it's over, Johnny.  And Natterman is a really funny guy who we all hang with at the cellar.  I spent time with him at last comic standing.  Maybe if he got a microphone.  Yeah, that one, Dan.  It could be funny.  Do we have microphones?  Yeah, he's got it.  Well, look, we knew the first few days would be like this.  We're experimenting and we're trying out this part of the studio.  That's all.  So we got Dan Natterman. 
[02:20:30]  He's sitting down.  He's getting mic'd up.  And we got Big A outside the studio.  Big A.  And he wants to come in here and talk about his marriage, which was very, very top secret  for a long time.  Since we've known Big A, he never brought this up.  Right.  And then all of a sudden he brought it up on, whose show was it?  Bob Kelly's Stupid Show on Saturday.  So nobody was listening.  After a fine night at FH Riley's, he decided to tell the world that he was married. 
[02:21:00]  And he didn't think we'd all pick up on it and decide we want to hear about this.  But then he was like, I don't want to talk about it.  You can't do that.  Yeah, it's too late for that.  Yeah.  So he decided he ought to do it on his terms, come in and explain what this was all about.  Married.  Married.  Oh, no.  Dan, you could just chime in.  Who was married?  That guy right there.  Big A.  He was married.  Wave, Big A.  Dan waved at him. 
[02:21:30]  Dan's just trying to be polite.  He doesn't know the atmosphere yet.  No, I'm just waiting for the right wave to jump in.  Yeah, just jump in.  Right wave.  Is his mic okay?  Yeah, we're just, we're testing the cordlesses.  It sounds a little low, a little low in the mix.  The wandless.  All right.  Should we bring Big A in?  Do we have another mic for Big A?  We may have to do the console for this one because if none of these mics are working over  here, we have three wireless.  And it's just silly.  Yeah, just, just Opie and Anthony are going to sound good. 
[02:22:00]  Okay.  Why?  That's all I care about.  Just for now, all the wireless mics are only coming in one channel.  All of them.  All right.  How about those at the console?  Well, this sounds fine.  I sound great.  Oh my God.  We really wanted to be over here on the couches.  Well, because we wanted like, you know, Big A to relax in the big chair here.  I guess we can move the chair over there.  The bear in the big comfy chair.  Yeah.  Because, you know, he could kick his feet up.  We want him very relaxed for this, for this segment because he's going to talk about his 
[02:22:30]  marriage, something he never wanted to talk about.  Obviously.  All right.  So we got to move over there if we need.  Yes.  We're not.  All right.  Can we figure out the wireless mics for tomorrow?  Yes.  Wait.  Mars is like, no, no, no.  We'll figure it out now.  Wow.  Mars, take it.  Mars is motivated.  But Mars, what?  All right.  Someone's saying, guys, this sounds like shit.  We know.  Someone's saying, ah, Mike is kind of fucked up too.  It sounds like Jimmy is in my left back seat. 
[02:23:00]  There's nothing wrong with your wireless.  All right.  I'm trying to get it.  A nice one coming in.  Dan is hilarious.  Dan is hilarious.  He was clearly the best on last comic standing a couple of years ago, and then it just updated  so I can't read the rest of it.  Guys, it sounds like shit.  All right.  We're going to move over there.  Cut our losses.  Try talking smart.  How about now?  No, I hate Jimmy's mic.  Jimmy's mic sucks.  Does it?  It's in both channels now, at least.  Now it's just too low.  So it sounds like shit twice as much. 
[02:23:30]  Yes.  All right.  Hold on.  Now they're remixing.  There's a little argument or a little confrontation going on out there.  I want them to fight.  Danny's yelling at Mars.  Mars is yelling at Danny.  Wow.  Now they're pointing.  Look at that.  This is scary radio.  It could break out in a fight at any time.  I love the new equipment.  Because we check out, you know, there's bugs in here.  What is this bug doing in here?  Get out of here.  We did the console part yesterday.  Right.  And now we got to shake down this part.  So for the listener, go fuck yourself. 
[02:24:00]  What do you want from us?  We got to tweak.  Oh, a show.  Shit.  Sorry.  Danny's throwing his arms up like, I told you already that.  Danny, are we good?  Kind of.  What about Jimmy's mic?  Let's hear from Jim.  How is that?  It still sounds shitty.  I can hear it.  Well, you're also on a different mic.  You're screaming at me.  What, Steve?  Your mic's not on.  Uh, Jim.  No, here.  Stop it.  Sorry.  Apparently, okay.  Jim, you're also using a different mic mechanically than they are, so it's not going to sound 
[02:24:30]  exactly the same.  No, no, I know, but it sounds awful.  I don't need to be a replica.  I understand.  Jim, it's an orange cone off Route 80.  Sounds good.  It looks like I can pick it up.  Well, somewhere between orange cone and the, you know, several thousand dollar microphone  Opie's, you know, uh, holding is yours.  So why can't we get some long cords and just, you know, use all those mics?  Because we got Natterman, we got myself, and we're going to have Natterman.  Yeah, I want to sit on this couch.  I don't want to sound bad.  Okay, then plan B. 
[02:25:00]  We'll get some long cords.  All right.  Hey, can you say something?  I just want to hear Ned.  Uh, test.  Test one.  Yeah.  All right.  Dan's mic works.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, it works.  That's good.  We want it to sound good as well, though.  Yeah, we want it to have good crystal.  Uh, why is Anthony so angry is what I'm reading up there.  You're right.  I addressed this the other day.  Sometimes I'll just start yelling about things and realize I don't even care about this.  Why would I yell?  I don't know.  Why am I mad?  I'm not.  You're right.  Mars, where are we at? 
[02:25:30]  Thumbs up.  We're getting there.  All right.  You do know, like, this is being broadcasted, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right.  This is in two countries.  Yeah.  This is being heard in Canada and the United States of America.  You said two countries.  It's the United States and then whatever that is.  Oh, uh, North United States.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two countries.  That old gag.  So, Dan, how are you?  That sounds better.  Better, right?  Yeah.  I just caught myself.  Hey, Jimmy's back.  What's up, Jimmy?  Hey.  Hi, boys.  What's up, Jimmy?  How you been? 
[02:26:00]  Oh, I'm all right.  That's good.  That sound okay?  A little better?  A little better.  All right.  Why don't we talk to Dan Natterman for a while?  Yes.  That sounds good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony podcast.  This is exciting.  It's our first podcast.  I know.  My pal Dan is on the show.  I was all psyched to have him come in and now we're fucking like a third-rate operation.  Well, this is nice leather, rich leather you got here.  Yes.  It's Corinthian, I believe.  This is certainly something new for me in radio, a nice leather couch.  Isn't it odd? 
[02:26:30]  Like, you're used to being at a console with a mic in front of you and being taken out of  that element completely sucks.  You know, I think I'm taken to it like a fish to water, I think.  Well, radio is a very delicate thing.  You know, everything's got to be just so.  I'm used to doing morning radio on the road where they tell you, jump in at any time and  then they proceed to discuss something that you could care less about.  Jump in at any time as we discuss a fight that broke out yesterday in Walmart. 
[02:27:00]  That's like some local story.  Jump in and be hilarious.  He's right.  Of course he is.  It's kind of what we do.  I think we said jump in any time as we're testing microphones, so we're not much better  off here.  This is different than I've done those radio shows.  He did.  He said check one, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is different.  Yeah.  Because I jumped in and we had Bret Michaels in the other day from Rock of Love.  Right.  Just jumping in, listening to audio, talking shit.  I mean, it does work that way here.  When you mean different, you mean the other shows are polished and know what they're doing? 
[02:27:30]  No, they're fucking hacky and hokey and unfun to do.  Yeah.  They're awful.  Also, we sit here and Opie has nothing in front of him as far as the CDs and your little  pad and everything.  Yeah.  The things that are used to guide the ship.  And you're more relaxed now than normal.  Yeah.  I'm going to show that I have other talents.  This is my time to shine. 
[02:28:00]  You're coming out party.  That's right.  What?  I don't need all that crap in front of me to be entertaining to the folks out there.  Let's do an interview.  Let's go.  Jump in.  Am I in a shape or is this my getting heavy?  It's like the bottom of it is weighted.  Look at that thing.  Switch arms.  It's like a pendulum.  It's a barbell.  It's a pendulum, the poor guy.  He's working out his forearms and doing radio at the same time.  I got to use two hands.  Yeah. 
[02:28:30]  Natterman and I spent some fun.  We were off the air in 2004, I think, or five when we were out doing Last Comic Standing.  We hung together in Vegas and proceeded to fucking hate everybody's gut.  You've never heard more vicious bile than you did coming out of me and him.  We didn't realize there were mics all over and you were trashing Peter Engel, who is  the exec producer.  And Natterman, who's Jewish, just kept saying, he's a terrible Jew.  He's a terrible Jew.  We were fucking trashing him all the time.  Well, he's got, you know, he's like the Jew producer type guy, you know, that's, you know, I don't know. 
[02:29:00]  Just sign here.  Don't worry.  I don't know.  That being said, I'm thinking of doing the show again.  Any thoughts?  Well, you should have gotten into the house.  There was somebody came back on the feedback that they thought you were hilarious.  Well, people always ask me because you remember.  You were like the last cut, right?  Before the house.  Well, among the last cuts.  Yeah.  People ask me, Drew Carey, you know, who was like in my corner because he was one of the 
[02:29:30]  judges and he was one of the guys that was like, you know, why isn't Dan?  They say, what has he done for you?  And the answer, just for everybody's knowledge, is absolutely nothing.  I had breakfast with him in L.A. last year and I was sort of hinting around.  I'm like, yeah, sure it's tough to get a good agent.  And he's like, yeah, you got to keep at it.  You know, I thought he was going to say, well, why didn't you say so?  You know, I'll hook you up.  Yeah, I can help you out with a good agent.  Fat, self-centered idiot not caring for anybody but himself.  Fuck him.  Well, he did pay for breakfast, but, you know, other than that.  Right. 
[02:30:00]  We got Stalker Patty on the bleachers.  We got Big A on the bleachers.  Do we have another microphone for these people?  Oh, boy.  Jimmy was a complete embarrassment on the elevator on the way up.  Oh, my God, was that funny.  I missed this for so long since we hadn't been coming to this studio.  You got in the elevator, and there were a couple of girls in there and some other guy.  And they were apparently pretty peeved that we were all piling in.  Yeah.  Because they walked in the elevator and thought they were going to be the only ones in the elevator. 
[02:30:30]  And then we walk in.  And Jimmy just stands there.  It's completely silent and just lets out a gasser that was very loud.  Yeah, I dropped two beauts.  And I was fucking laughing, so I was trying to turn to my left and act like I was scolding Anthony by looking at him.  Yeah.  But I'm such an awful actor.  And then I have to go because I didn't want them to think it's me.  So I was like, Jimmy, you are one of the most disgusting, horrid people on the face of the earth.  And the women in there were terrified. 
[02:31:00]  They were disgusted by you.  Yeah, they were beautiful.  Their faces were like, how does a human being do that in an elevator full of people?  And Jimmy was wheezing instead of laughing.  Oh, we got out of there just cracking up down the hallway.  Yeah.  There's something hysterical about that.  I don't know why.  And fucking chicks will never appreciate it.  It's amazing.  They wonder why we don't want to hang out with them.  It's like they would just be really upset you've embarrassed me. 
[02:31:30]  And your fucking dumb friends.  You get an elevator full of guys and someone just out of the silence blasts a loud fart.  People are going to laugh.  Whether they know you're not, someone's going to just start laughing.  The girls in that elevator, they get so pissed off and angry that you would even think of doing something like that.  Guys in the restroom, I'm going to eat the cellar and I'm taking a leak and there'll be a guy in the restroom and I'll fart.  And I hear, I just hear him like, it's a fucking instinct.  The guy is going to fucking laugh at it. 
[02:32:00]  When you walk into a bathroom and in the stall, you hear that, that stall echo and just, you start laughing.  It's a hysterical sound.  I like the strain.  The, I like when you're in an airport and you can actually hear food poisoning.  I must have had the shrimp from the fucking, the long flight from London.  Dan, anything on farts or what?  Jump in.  Jump in.  I try to avoid. 
[02:32:30]  Jump in.  I try to avoid a public, public defecation.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I get embarrassed.  So I'll, I'll take the chance and take the cab or whatever.  Yeah, that's what I, I, I, I don't like taking a dump in a public bathroom unless I absolutely have to.  Like an emergency.  If I feel I can't make it home.  Yeah, yeah.  That's pretty much it.  Or if my stomach is, is pounding.  Like a real bad stomach ache.  You know you're just going to be pissing out your ass.  You got to get in there.  But sometimes it's not easy if you're, if you're out and about downtown. 
[02:33:00]  There's, you know.  Yeah, available bathrooms.  I went to NYU Law School and I pleaded with the guy one time.  I said, you know, because they're like, you got to have, you know, only for students there.  And I, she's like, dude, man, I got to, I got to go.  He's like, no, I can't do it.  You know.  To register.  I thought it was.  I got to go.  Yeah, I got to, I got to fill out an application.  I don't know why.  I thought it was universal.  If a guy has to take a dump, you got, you got to let that, you know.  Yeah.  It should be a law.  Of course.  I was walking one time with my friend Paul to steal comic books and I had to shit. 
[02:33:30]  We were by the woods.  So I had on silk shorts, silk running shorts and no underwear.  And I fucking, I took a shit in the bushes and yellow jackets were flying between my legs.  I'll never forget the yellow jackets.  I guess I was standing by a bee's hide and there were fucking bees flying around and I  had to wipe my ass with my socks and throw them out.  It's true.  They were confused.  They're like, it looks like a hornet's nest.  They gather on your ball bag. 
[02:34:00]  Anything on yellow jackets stinging your ball bag?  Nah.  Yeah, just jump in.  Just jump in anytime.  You just jump in.  Snake eyes.  God damn.  My only public crap was like when I was four at a pool.  I just, it's a big brown, you know, or three maybe, I don't know, and it just went through.  I can't stand when kids shit in the pool just ruins everything.  No, it wasn't in the pool, it was on the deck. 
[02:34:30]  It was on the cabana.  Well, good thing.  Anything in the pool.  When I was at the wonderful Disney, I wanted to go in the pool near our little complex that  we were staying in, and there was a retarded girl in the pool, and that's enough to know  that there's just shit going on in there.  She's at least pissing in there, at least. 
[02:35:00]  Well, she shit herself and had her period.  I swear to God, it looked like fucking Quint getting eaten by the fucking shark.  It was just a mess in the water.  Let's drink to your chromosome.  And then I felt bad because she's there, obviously, with her family, who is just annoyed that this  is happening, but I felt bad for them because then they have to take her out and clean her  up and apologize, and then Disney crew came out and covered the pool up and throwing fucking 
[02:35:30]  hydrochloric acid in there trying to burn away the blood, but the family was just like,  Oh, we're so sorry.  It's like everything's nothing.  It's just apology.  It's a big apology tour when you have to travel around with Pete Rose.  Did her mother start yelling at her like Piper Laurie and Carrie?  When Carrie had her period.  Plug it up.  Plug it up.  I could see your dirty pillars.  How many people continued swimming? 
[02:36:00]  Well, after that, I guess they didn't know that it happened.  We walked up right when it was happening.  It's like, what the fuck is going on?  I hear like screaming or something.  And after that, though, the people didn't know what happened.  They jumped right in.  Of course they did.  They didn't care.  You want to say hi to Stalker Patty or want to get into the Big A interview?  We could do both.  I would say we should greet Patty quickly.  Hi, Patty.  Patty.  Hi, how you doing?  Oh, wow.  That voice in that room.  What do you think of the new digs? 
[02:36:30]  I thought I was in a different place.  It's different.  Good.  Say different twice in the same sentence.  I just don't recognize it.  They really did a number.  It looks great.  Yeah, describe it for the radio audience.  Okay, where the studio used to be, it's now enlarged into a huge room with about 11,000 TV monitors.  They could monitor all those shows.  About 11,000? 
[02:37:00]  Well, that's what it seems.  And then there's like glass and then the area.  Do you know what 11,000 monitors would look like, Patty?  Oh, I know.  I'm just exaggerating.  Exaggerating.  And then where the bleachers are used to be.  I don't mean to interrupt you, Patty, Patty, Patty.  If you say like, it seems like there's 50 monitors in here.  That's an exaggeration you make when there's 12.  But it seems like 11,000.  It seems like there's only 212,049 monitors. 
[02:37:30]  You just sound silly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're a dope.  There's rules to exaggerated humor.  Exactly.  Okay, continue.  But it rules.  It's great.  They did great work in here.  And what are you sitting on?  Bleachers.  And what are you looking through?  What?  What are you looking through?  A glass.  A big, huge plate glass window.  And what are we doing?  You're sitting in easy chairs. 
[02:38:00]  That's another thing.  Easy chairs.  Nice easy chairs and sofas and divins.  Easy chair.  1955 woman.  Exactly.  Very comfortable looking.  Get me the clicker.  Don't you wish you had a couch or a chair like this in your apartment?  Yeah, it would be nice, but the apartment's not big enough.  It's only half the size of this area that I'm sitting in.  Really?  Yeah.  You don't have enough room in your apartment for a chair?  I do.  I have a chair and a table, but it's very small space. 
[02:38:30]  You've got a hole in it, and she shits into it.  You live better in prison, Patti.  Yeah.  What about your bedroom?  I don't have.  My bedroom is my apartment.  Wait, wait.  So you have one single room?  Yeah, the bed is in one corner, the closet in the other, my table and computer in the  other corner, and the other corner are I cooking.  And what about the shitter?  Where's the bathroom?  The bathroom is a separate little room, which is a private room.  It's mine.  Wait, wait.  Is it off of your bedroom? 
[02:39:00]  Do you have to leave the apartment and go down the hall by the red neon light flashing  outside?  No, it's part of my apartment.  I just go through the doorway, and I've got my shower sink and whatever.  And your toilet.  And your turlet.  What kind of kitchen you got?  My kitchen is a part of the apartment.  It's not a real kitchen.  What the fuck else is it?  It's just an area, that's all.  Wait, wait.  So you have a plugged-in hot plate, is what you're saying?  Yes.  A hot plate.  A hot plate, a convection oven, and a microwave. 
[02:39:30]  A convection oven.  What is that?  Like an easy-bake oven?  It's a toaster oven.  Oh, okay.  She has a fucking hot plate, a toaster oven, and a microwave.  What about stuff you want to keep cold?  I have a refrigerator built underneath where the sink is.  It's one of those little party refrigerators, right?  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, it's square, and you could fit, like, one fucking, hopefully you're fitting a box  of Topps hamburgers in there that you're going to eat tonight.  I don't really eat hamburgers. 
[02:40:00]  No?  Anyone recall?  They got E. coli in it?  Yeah, they got E. coli.  I'm hoping she dies of it.  I'm a veggies and fruit person.  Oh, yeah.  You see, we got a stripper pole in here, too?  Yeah, I see it.  Patty, have you ever had any experience on a stripper pole?  I heard you have.  No.  I heard you have.  What?  I heard she went down to, like, one of the appearances down at one of the titty bars.  No.  I've never been in one.  Got on the pole?  Except the one that Ron and Fez gave the party in, and I just sat down all night in the chair 
[02:40:30]  and watched everything.  Everything.  Do you think you got some moves?  I don't know.  I like to dance when I put my records on and stuff.  Well, what do you think?  I feel bad that my friend isn't here, and I have nothing to show him that makes the show  what it normally is.  We'd love to have a chick in here.  Well, Patty could, like, make believe she's a chick today for us.  Patty?  Yeah, I'll have both the glamour of Fez. 
[02:41:00]  Patty, would you do a...  But she's the kind of girl I would get at a strip club.  You know, it sounds different.  Plus, you know, she'll probably, you know, work a little extra harder.  Yeah.  She's the type of stripper that, like, when she comes up, you look at your watch and it's  time to go.  Every time I used to go to, like, a local strip club out on Long Island, you'd wait,  the stripper would leave the stage, and you're like, ah, I should go.  And then you see the next girl putting music in the jukebox, she's punching music in, 
[02:41:30]  and you go, all right, wait, I gotta fucking see her.  I gotta see her.  And then you see one walk in the door, like, with her whore makeup on and her jacket, and  she walks into the back, and you go, all right, now I gotta wait for her to come out.  But then when a girl like Patty would get up there, it would be like, okay, yeah, I'll  finish this beer.  When would a girl like Patty get up there?  Day stripper in Ronkonkoma.  When the strippers are striking, and they got the scabs coming in.  You ever been to Bird's Place at about noon?  Out there in Ronkonkoma.  Yeah, but the super hot strippers, you know, they got attitude, you know? 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  They give you a lap dance in name only.  Like a foot away from you.  I hate that shit.  Strip clubs just do nothing for me.  Don't touch.  You got some big bruiser that's gonna punch you in the fucking face if you even try to  touch a hip.  I was in Vegas, and they said, because I thought Vegas, my first time there, and I knew Reno  prostitution is legal, so I didn't know that Vegas, I thought it might have been.  And the woman said to me, go to the champagne room with me, 300 bucks. 
[02:42:30]  I said, well, what goes on?  She said, trust me, it's worth it.  So I figured that's code, you know?  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, I get it.  Right.  Loud and clear.  You don't have to tell me twice.  I'm hip.  And I know back there, 300 bucks later, I get three of the sorriest lap dances ever,  and a bottle of champagne.  Did you get a handjob at least?  Nothing.  That's it?  Three?  You said it would be worth, trust me, it's worth it.  Did you feel it was worth it?  It was not worth it.  It was a crazy horse, too, I believe it was called.  Did you get?  Ah, bitches.  Did you get to see Heinehole? 
[02:43:00]  I got nothing.  Didn't even get to see Heinehole.  Maybe I saw, like, because when, with the thong, and sometimes you see each side of it,  kind of.  Yeah.  You see where it goes.  But what good does that do me?  Nothing.  All right, bring Patty in for Dan.  Patty.  All right, Patty.  You've got to explain Patty to Dan.  She doesn't know, he doesn't know.  I'm getting a...  Patty's early...  He figured it out very early on.  The early days of Patty were very tragic.  She was born to a prostitute mother and a Wall Street worker who were not married. 
[02:43:30]  The mother left her on a counter in a diner.  This is all true.  She was then picked up and brought to the New York Foundling Center.  Society.  I like to say society.  Where her and Spanky, Alfalfa, and the rest of our gang grew up.  Yeah.  And she was then adopted or kind of foster home.  Foster home.  Yeah, foster home by other people and then a highly religious old couple who instilled  her with religion that to this day has kept her from being a normal, functional human 
[02:44:00]  being.  She is 50...  How old now?  I'm 52.  She's 52.  I think I look great.  I think I look great.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Shut up with the looking great.  She's 52 and a virgin.  She has never had a man fuck her.  Why is Dan blinking a lot?  You want that?  No, I just...  What turned you on?  That's one of the various nervous habits that I have.  And you're happy that I pointed it out.  I'm really sorry.  That's all right.  I just saw you blinking when she said 52-year-old virgin. 
[02:44:30]  I thought that might be your thing or something.  I don't know.  She is a virgin.  Not necessarily.  It's certainly interesting.  She's looking for the right guy who...  She has that accent.  What kind of accent?  Is it an interesting voice?  It's...  Staten Island.  Oh, is this guy?  No.  Staten Island.  Staten Island.  You're just kidding.  Staten Island a real bad name.  It kind of all just reminds me of Bugs Bunny when he's having...  Giving that monster a hairdo a little bit.  It's such interesting people.  You mean such interesting... 
[02:45:00]  Time to put the Patties in the water.  Patty, do you think Dan's cute?  He's very good looking.  Oh, well, thank you, Patty.  It's nice of you to say so.  Patty's looking for the right guy.  Who would be your type in this room?  Oh, I don't know.  Look at E-Rock.  Look at Danny.  Actually...  Look at everyone in this room.  I'm in love with one person you had here, and oh, I love this guy, Criss Angel.  Do you really?  Yeah.  I'd like to see him take his fist and make your hymen disappear.  I love him.  What?  I had him on the show a couple times. 
[02:45:30]  It was great listening to him.  You're hoping he can do it.  You're in love with him.  You're in love with him.  Kind of like magic makeover, right?  Make you look pretty and shit.  Patty, do you use that vibrating dildo thing we got for you while you watch his TV show?  No.  Criss Angel.  Do you watch his show?  Yeah, I have.  The scariest thing was the wood chip machine.  That got me really scared.  Patty, sit down.  It got you really scared.  Sit down in the chair.  You're the first one to use the lounge chair.  Yeah, go ahead.  Take a seat.  You look like you put on a couple pounds. 
[02:46:00]  Patty, you're getting fat.  Well, that's not...  I'm not getting fat.  You're starting to look like...  I'm actually eating less than trying to walk and stuff.  You got the shape of a pear all of a sudden.  Yeah.  What happened?  You used to have...  Your hips weren't that big.  I don't know.  I'm trying to fight it.  You know, you didn't have it like a year ago.  You didn't have as much hips and belly.  Your shoulders are thick.  You look like a snake that has just eaten.  I don't know.  I think it has to do with changes in my body.  I'm trying to fight it.  You look like a snake ready to poop.  Maybe I should get Ian Smith back and ask him about the fat smash diet to see what to 
[02:46:30]  do with someone like me.  I don't eat a lot of things it is, and it's fruits and vegetables.  Yeah.  What are you eating?  Whole watermelons?  You need to eat cock.  That'll keep you in shape.  That might.  So, have you ever jerked off to Criss Angel in your private life there?  No, I just enjoy watching him.  But you said you're in love with him.  Yeah, I know.  I have a crush on him. 
[02:47:00]  Do you get like a little tingle when you see him?  He doesn't even know I exist.  But do you pet the poodle and think about him, or what?  No, I don't.  You don't do a little diddle?  No.  You said you take care of yourself in your apartment at night sometimes.  You know, I eat right.  I don't mean take care of yourself like that, dummy.  I mean, you diddle yourself.  You take your hand or a vibrator, and you masturbate.  You know, you pound your own pussy.  Yeah.  You do that, right?  Every so often.  Oh, I'm a badass. 
[02:47:30]  I'm a lady.  You got it.  You got it.  Come on, Patty.  Everyone does it.  It's not something you're talking about that no one knows about.  Yeah, Dan, when was the last time you jerked off?  Yeah.  Just to keep her, you know.  Gee, you know, not as much as some folks.  I would say probably two days ago.  Yeah.  But I'm not an everyday guy.  See, there you go, Patty.  Yeah, no, not necessarily an everyday guy.  So, when was the last time you, you know, did what you did there?  Yeah, Patty.  Oh, my God.  When was it?  You're catching up from a whole youth of not doing this. 
[02:48:00]  It was probably last night.  Well, you know, once in a while when I go to bed, you know, but after I take my shower.  That certainly does relax you for a bit.  You seem very relaxed.  When was it, Patty?  We're up to what?  When was it?  Come on.  It's Tuesday, right?  You remember.  Can't she hold her microphone?  A couple of, I don't know, a couple.  A couple of nights ago?  I'm going to go with Sunday night. 
[02:48:30]  On the Sabbath?  Sunday night?  No.  Maybe last week sometime.  Saturday?  I don't remember.  Did you have the TV on?  No.  What did you think of?  I'm going to sleep at that time.  Yeah, you can't just do it.  You've got to fantasize.  What are you thinking about?  Your mind's drifting.  Where does it drift when you start touching yourself?  I go to sleep.  No, no, no.  When you're doing it.  You need to think of shit.  You need to stimulate your mind along with your body.  I just relax.  That's the wall.  But what do you think about? 
[02:49:00]  It's a relaxing tactic.  You must think about somebody touching you.  No, actually, I don't.  What do you think of?  You're like a wild animal.  You can't make your mind blank.  I do.  Unless you're talking on this show.  She just thinks of oats and cums.  I don't think of anybody.  No, there's something that has to be.  I'm being honest.  There has to be something going on in your head when you're doing that.  What is it?  Maybe you're thinking of something else that has nothing to do with sex.  You think of Jesus scolding you?  Right.  Is that what you think of?  With me, it's usually a girl who's not enjoying it. 
[02:49:30]  No, I just, I don't know.  No, I don't think of anything.  There's no images.  The edge?  Do you think of the edge?  It's just the relaxing technique, you know?  Relaxing technique.  Yeah, that's all it is.  Do you do it until you have an orgasm?  Do you have a little shiver and feel really good and then you're done?  Ugly.  After about five minutes, I stop. 
[02:50:00]  Ugly.  And then just put it away and go to sleep.  Kind of hot.  But is it that you cum and then that makes you tired?  How do you not know?  Didn't you have an orgasm in this studio once?  Didn't you?  I helped you, Patty.  Remember?  No, but.  I helped you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You had an orgasm.  So you know what it feels like.  Well, yeah, I get the sensations.  You felt it building up, building up, and then all of a sudden, ah, it felt good, right?  Well, yeah, and then I can't do it very long. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah, but you do it at home.  Yeah, I'm private.  And you do it until you reach that point.  Well, yeah.  Okay.  Hey, why aren't you wearing a bra?  She never wears a bra.  Because I never do.  I don't have anything to really hold up.  Well, whatever you don't have is sinking down.  So I just gave up on them.  I felt like I could just get away wearing a shirt.  They're sinking a little bit.  Yeah, Patty, when your boobs are further away from your shoulders than they are your belly, 
[02:51:00]  that's a bad sign.  Show Dan what you got.  My belly's way down here.  Oh, I don't need to, necessarily.  My belly is way down here.  You're going to have to cover them in a weightlifter's belt.  Hey, I've seen some dancers that were very sacky.  Why don't you criticize them?  Well, Dan's an expert.  Why don't you just flash them real fast?  Can you flash our friend?  Make us look good because we don't have nobody to flash him.  All right, stand up.  Stand up.  Dan's a good guy.  You've got to see these.  Brilliantly funny guys. 
[02:51:30]  She's actually very well built for being a two-year-old.  Turn around.  Well, you know, it's up to you.  I don't need, you know.  Just do it for Dan.  What do you say at a time like this?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there you go.  You know, that wasn't so bad.  No, of course not.  She's actually a very...  They were nice.  Where are you buying your pants these days?  Motorcycle cops are us?  Don't our pants look like biker cop pants?  Well, it's a little cooler out today.  You really are getting a little wide.  I usually wear shorts.  No, your hips are getting... 
[02:52:00]  You never had that, Patty.  Turn around.  No, your thighs, I mean.  I'm sorry.  You're right there.  I can't help it.  Right there.  That's a problem area for you.  Oh, yeah.  I have no idea where it's coming from because I eat no sugar, no fat, no meat, nothing.  So I don't know where it's coming from.  What do you eat for dinner?  Well, yesterday for dinner, I had a little pasta with some mescaline salad boiled into it.  I had peas and corn.  I wish I had some mescaline.  And I had the C-Labs crab meat over pasta.  Jeez, keep eating.  Wait, the what? 
[02:52:30]  C-Legs.  C-Legs?  What the hell is that?  It's like crab meat and pollock, you know?  It's fake crab meat.  It's like fish that they grind up and shape into crab leg shapes, right?  Yeah, I like that.  And then the day before, I just had a hot dog and vegetables.  You know what it is, Patty?  And then I had a salad.  A bit older, and men's center of gravity is here.  That's why we get bellies, and with women, it's like ass and thighs.  Yeah.  It's just aging.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I don't know what to do about it.  Does Ian Smith have an answer for that? 
[02:53:00]  I do.  I walk five miles every day.  Do handstands on the moon, and that might prevent your hips from getting wide.  You're going to dance for us on the polar one?  Yeah.  I'll try.  Here we go.  I'll make an honest attempt.  Well, that means you have to take clothes off while you do it.  Somewhat.  Yeah, you don't have to be totally naked.  Oh, boy.  Well, all I'll be wearing are my underpants.  All right, that's fine.  I would like to see that.  Dan would love to see that.  I'm a fan of your body.  I've touched it.  You know that?  Yeah.  I think you look good.  We need the translucent windows.  What kind of song do you want to dance to? 
[02:53:30]  The ones that you hit a button, and electronically, they turn white.  I would love safety dance.  Safety dance?  I like that.  That's cool.  That's sexy, too.  All right, we're going to do safety dance.  Get on the pole there.  Danny, get the mic near her.  Safety dance will be men without rods.  Okay.  All right.  Here's Stalker Patty in the stripper pole.  Dance if you want to.  That's right.  All right.  Now, you dance, right, Patty?  You know how to dance.  I dance.  Yeah.  Patty, microphone, sweetheart. 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, I can dance.  I even took a little bit of tap dancing at school.  Oh, wait a minute.  I don't have the right shoes.  Of course you did.  Can you tap dance?  A little bit.  Can you show us a bit of a tap dance move?  I can't do it very well with sneakers.  You certainly can't.  Dan, what are you thinking of her tap dancing?  It's like river dance she's doing.  I don't know.  If I had heels on it.  She looks like Helen Keller trying to communicate. 
[02:54:30]  Tapping out some type of code.  And I only took it in college, which was 30 years ago.  College.  Hey, can we mic the audience, too?  Well, we're running out of microphones at this point.  I think we have one more.  Patty, we want to see at least your underpants.  All right, keep that door open so we can hear their reaction.  Can we at least see your underpants?  Keep those two doors open.  Oh, God.  All right, ready, Patty?  We got safety dance for Patty?  Okay.  Here's Stalker Patty trying out the stripper pole. 
[02:55:00]  Here's safety dance, Patty.  Yeah.  Work the room.  Go ahead.  I don't hear anything.  Yeah.  Why would it play?  It's playing.  You hear it?  Yeah, there it is.  All right, here she goes.  Oh.  She's using the pole.  Wow.  She's working the pole, sort of. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, kick dancing.  It's going to start raining outside.  She's just kind of twirling around the pole right now.  Yeah.  Exactly.  With her right hand on the pole.  Like Brittany at the MTV Awards.  Look at her go.  I know.  She's like Lulu when she's starting with love.  This is just like the beginning of Grindhouse. 
[02:56:00]  All right, Patty, you did that move already.  Something new.  She can dance, though.  She certainly can.  All right, now you've got to start taking clothes off.  Please.  Don't be shy.  All right, here she goes.  Yeah, don't be shy.  Here we go.  Give her a nice bite.  Pants look up.  You've got to keep dancing as you do it, too.  Yeah.  Like how the strippers do it.  Yeah.  We don't like professional strippers around here.  Or even women.  Kick those rotting sneakers off, will you? 
[02:56:30]  Yes.  All right, there you go, Dan.  That's for you.  We're going to make our guests feel welcome.  Yeah.  It's the art of the shapeless.  All right, here come the old lady jeans.  Oh, she has XM panties.  If you're wearing I'm being Anthony panties, I'm going to puke.  That's all she has.  I know.  Every time she's here, she's got those on.  The two caricatures on them are holding their nose.  Did you pill for like 80 of those or 11,000? 
[02:57:00]  Come on, Patty.  The song is halfway over.  There you go.  Ah, now we're talking.  Yeah.  Nice.  Wow.  All right.  And the crowd goes crazy outside the studio.  Now she's dancing.  She's on the hall.  In her black Opie and Anthony panties.  I like this.  Dan, what do you think so far?  You know, what do you say?  Wow.  She is really gone. 
[02:57:30]  Check out the feet, Dan.  We had them fixed for her.  We paid for that.  Yeah, we did.  We paid for that.  We bought those feet.  They were worse.  What kind of work do you do, Patty?  That's what I ask strippers normally.  It's like, what do you do?  What are you studying in school?  Right, right.  All right, come on, Patty.  Loose the shirt.  I work in a coffee shop.  I make lattes.  Yeah, I make lattes. 
[02:58:00]  You know where the focus button is on there, Dan?  All right, Dan, here's some money for you.  There you go.  Oh, my God.  Look at that toe.  There you go.  One toe going one way, one going the other.  Keep one for myself.  One in the middle going, what do you want from me?  The other one.  Dan is handing out the money to stalker Patty.  He's keeping one for myself for my troubles.  That's great.  All right, come on, Patty.  Loose the shirt.  Oh, Patty's got, um, it's like Patty's hips belong in 4-3 ratio, and they're at 16-9. 
[02:58:30]  I've never seen.  There we go.  Beautiful dress.  Now we're talking.  Check out this E.T. body dance.  Nice.  Patty, go to it.  Yeah.  There you go.  Hey, here's another dollar for you.  Oh, Dan, turn me over the, uh.  I can't keep these.  Stick them in your, uh, your, uh, underwear.  There you go.  All right.  Keep, keep dancing. 
[02:59:00]  Keep dancing a little.  Show the ladies outside the studio.  Turn around there.  Spin around the pole.  Spin around.  Spin around that pole.  You got an audience out there.  Look at that.  Don't snap a hip, but spin around the pole.  I've never seen a thin girl with cellulite before.  This is amazing.  Those feet.  Patty, you have the feet of a silverback.  They're just pointing in weird directions.  Yeah, they certainly are.  Patty, turn around.  Come on.  Turn around.  We got some big wigs.  Wow. 
[02:59:30]  What's wrong?  Here's cherry pie.  Let's go.  Now get funky.  Ladies and gentlemen, give her a big hand.  Oh, wait.  She's putting her pants back on.  They would be clapping for that at the club.  What happened?  Turn down the music.  We lost Patty somewhere.  Turn off the cherry pie.  What happened, Patty?  I'm a sport.  Yes, you are.  Yeah.  I'm so embarrassed.  No, you did a great job.  I got to tell you.  Well, thank you.  I have guts.  That's bizarre. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, you do.  They're hanging all over the place.  They're resting right there where the big lumps are.  If Ian Smith could send me a copy of his book.  He doesn't even know you're alive.  Enough about Ian Smith.  We'll get you on, Patty.  I really want to meet him to see what to do when you're over 50 and things happen that  you don't plan.  He gives her a book with a noose on it?  Do you exercise, Patty?  Yes, I do.  What do you do?  Well, when I walk to my friend's house in Staten Island, I walk about seven miles from the 
[03:00:30]  boat to their house.  And then I walk the entire length from Times Square all the way to the ferry.  What the hell is she?  And I also put deliveries away at work.  I can lift 15, 20-pound boxes over my head and put it on a high shelf and pile them up,  too.  Wow.  Lift a two-ton box over your head and drop it.  So I can't see how I'm not getting exercise.  I am.  Patty, but no, I don't think you're getting the problem areas.  Right.  You should maybe be doing some sit-ups.  I need somebody to advise me.  You don't know how to do a sit-up?  You don't know how to do a sit-up?  Do Pilates. 
[03:01:00]  Patty, you've got to get...  I don't know what that is.  You've got to get your heart rate up.  You've got to...  Well, that's why I also have to be careful.  I have a heart condition, too.  What?  It's an irregular heartbeat, and I have my...  You're giving everybody a heart condition.  Yeah, but I'm taking medication for it, too.  I've got to talk to my doctor about what's safe to do, as far as my heart's concerned.  Oh, perhaps that's causing your problem.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, so what can I do that's a safe exercise?  Did he prescribe cake? 
[03:01:30]  What?  No, I don't eat cake.  What are you taking for the heart?  Marshmallows.  Diabin.  I don't know how to pronounce it.  D-I-O-V-A-N.  D-I-O-V-A-N is the product I'm taking, but I don't know how to say it.  People have been checking you out on PalTalk.  Oh, no.  I forgot about PalTalk.  One person is saying you look like a retarded penguin.  Oh, that's funny, actually.  I'm not retarded, but I can look like a penguin. 
[03:02:00]  Well, all right.  Way to take lemons and make lemonade.  She looks like Geddy Lee more and more every day.  Yeah, yeah.  I do see that.  Geddy Lee in your face there.  All right, Patty.  I like Rush.  All right.  Well, there you go.  There's Stucker Patty with her rotting sneakers.  Do we have to buy your sneakers now, too?  Oh, these are brand new.  I bought them over the summer.  You need socks, Patty.  What, are you buying from a homeless guy?  No, I bought them from Payless Shoe Source. 
[03:02:30]  They were on sale.  Payless.  Payless, right?  Yeah, it's where it goes.  Payless.  I like Payless.  Payless.  All right, Patty.  All right, thank you, Patty.  Thank you, Patty.  Fantastic job.  Stucker Patty, everyone.  Yeah, I would give her a big hand.  She's done a fantastic job.  Studio audience is going crazy.  No, the door's on the other side of the door.  Patty is a tripper.  Oh, and she's tripping over everything.  Oh, she'll mess.  Come here.  Who are these people?  Yeah, who did we just...  Big wigs.  Who did we just embarrass? 
[03:03:00]  Do we have to be nice to anyone out there?  Oh, no, not especially.  Oh, cool.  Who are they?  Well, we've got Leslie from KSL.  She's in charge of Bodog.  Nice.  Nice.  We have...  BodogFantasy.net.  Fantasy football, yes.  We've got Marianne from AdamandEve.com.  They're the girls that are going to come in and Christian's studio in a couple of weeks.  Oh, what are they doing for us?  Anything you want.  She's going to do anything?  No, not her, but her people.  The poll, yeah.  Maybe the poll.  Good.  And you've got the people from GoToMyPC.com.  Oh, I use that. 
[03:03:30]  I love it.  What is it?  GoToMyPC.com.  When I'm on the road, from my laptop, I pop on my home computer, turn on my camera, and  I look around my house.  Ooh.  It's fantastic.  I do that, and I look around my house.  I absolutely want...  I want to catch my girlfriend blowing people in the building.  That's why you designed the service, Jim.  It gives you a little peace of mind.  And then if I'm at the studio, and I get a file that I forgot at home, I could just pop 
[03:04:00]  up my desktop right at home, and you work your own computer from whatever computer you're  on.  And it's pretty much hack-proof?  Yeah.  The security's right there.  I haven't heard of one problem.  That's pretty cool.  That's really cool, actually.  Who else we got out there, Will?  We have the folks from Gamefly.  Gamefly.  Gamefly.  Yes.  Great one.  And then the rest are just XM sales folk.  Oh, those are scum.  Certainly.  XM sales people.  Tell us about the discount, Harry.  All right.  Enough about the discount. 
[03:04:30]  We want to roll her up in that awning and throw her in a river.  Enough about the discount.  Hey, they're not enjoying our sales humor, I noticed.  No.  Stop.  It's a very important client.  Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.  Get a harumph out of you.  Craig was the guy here in the white pants there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you see him salivating a little bit over Patty?  Yeah, there was a little love connection there.  Very gentleman.  Craig, you like Patty?  He was hot.  Cool.  He was hot.  Does Craig know he's wearing the same jacket as the Iranian president? 
[03:05:00]  I got it.  All right.  Big A style?  There he is.  Yeah, we're going to bring Big A in next after the break, and we're going to talk about  his marriage.  Yeah, that's the big mystery.  And Dan Natterman, for the first time on the Opie and Anthony show.  I love this guy's stand-up.  He's great.  One of my favorites, by the way, when I go to the cellar every once in a while.  Oh, thank you.  I appreciate it.  Are you promoting anything, or?  Uh, jeez. 
[03:05:30]  You can go to dailycomedy.com and see some of, you know, I got some jokes that I posted,  and, uh, I got the business sense of, uh, Patty.  Oh, really?  No website or anything?  I do have a website.  There's not much on it right now.  Oh, boy.  I had a webcast that, uh, we haven't done a new episode in a while, but, but it's up  there, and, um...  Dan Natterman is just a funny dude.  I love it.  He's just a funny fucking guy.  Yeah.  I put a website together and then just forgot about it. 
[03:06:00]  There's dates there from, like, 1998.  Well, my sister does some, uh, does some nutrition consulting in Chicago.  If you want to go see her, as long as I'm here, I just want to plug it.  You're a nutrition consultant.  Well, you'll be hanging for a while.  We've got time.  Yeah.  No rush.  Yeah, I'll think it's time.  I say dailycomedy.com.  I posted some jokes up there.  It's a fun website.  Some videos.  You can see some videos that I've done.  And you can check Nan and Nan at the Cellar.  He's there, uh, a lot.  He's there very often, and he's a very funny comedian. 
[03:06:30]  All right, we'll talk to Big A next.  It's Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  I stand alone  Everything that I believe is fading  I stand alone  Hello?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  We are.  They just had to change something with the headphones.  That sounds hysterical. 
[03:07:00]  Are we on, though?  Can you hear us out there?  All right, this is useless, though.  I can hear nothing on the headphones.  Yeah, all of a sudden, the headphones just sound like this muffled mess.  Oh, you're saying it's got to take a second?  I kind of like it.  I like it like this.  All right.  If it's good, I have a lemon-sized tumor on my brainstem.  Hey, this is...  No, the way it sounds, it's awful, right?  It sounds muffled.  Because it's just our headphones.  You sure?  Yeah, because the... 
[03:07:30]  Something's dying over there.  Your fire.  It's dying.  What is it besides hopefully everyone that we work with?  This is the fun of testing out all the equipment.  What's up, Mars?  It was fine before the commercial.  What's going on, Mars?  What's going on?  Steve is saying that he changed the batteries.  It was fine before we took a break.  Now it's not fine.  And why does Steve have a butt plug in his hand?  Oh.  Because it's hard to talk with it in his mouth. 
[03:08:00]  But...  What are we...  All right, we got to get figured out.  All the batteries changed.  Yeah, no.  These batteries are fresh.  But how...  Yeah, how could all three of our batteries go dead during the break?  It doesn't happen that way.  It doesn't make sense.  Mars, if you change that battery, I'm going to laugh at you.  Yeah, don't change the battery.  You want to get the battery changed?  Yeah, I didn't get a quick change.  Why would all three batteries go out, though?  I don't know.  It can't be the three of our batteries.  Oh, boy.  There's got to be a common denominator.  All right, Mars is changing the battery.  Mars, just change the battery.  Get your ass to Mars. 
[03:08:30]  Okay, let's see.  Here he goes.  Old battery.  It's thrilling.  We're actually doing a play-by-play of a battery change.  The 9-volt goes in.  He puts it back in the case.  Wow, he's having a little trouble.  No, and he flipped it over.  And the knob comes through.  No, he flipped it back over.  He made a mistake.  Holy shit.  It's going to cost him some big time.  And now as he plugs this in, Jimmy gets the same crappy sound that he had before.  You know what?  What?  Mars changed the battery.  And it's much better?  I hear nothing. 
[03:09:00]  Of course you don't.  What did you put in there?  Fucking chewing gum?  I hear nothing.  It's muffled.  I got a bit of an observation.  We got a lot of people on the bleachers today, and they're like, holy shit, we're trying  to talk people into buying this shit.  This is what they do?  Not every day.  Now he's putting the old body back in.  They're testing out new equipment.  Yeah, they're going to have to tell him later.  They're just testing new equipment.  Don't worry.  It's never like that.  This is actually as smoothly as the show has ever run.  Go back and tell your clients that one. 
[03:09:30]  Any, okay, here we go.  I'm going to do a little detective work.  Before we went to break, everything was fine.  Perfect.  When we came back from break, the headphones are fucked up.  What happened between the time we were on the air, the break, and then back on the air?  That fucked up.  Anyone?  Anyone. 
[03:10:00]  What happened?  They changed the transmitter battery.  They changed the transmitter battery.  Obviously, it didn't have to be changed.  No, it did.  You guys were hearing that awful.  Yeah, it was going back.  The awful thing was the show, Crystal Clear.  Maybe that thing is the problem.  That thing that looks like it could have been a cell phone back in 1952.  The thing that's making us all sterile?  Yeah, it's on wheels.  It's like Johnny Five from Short Circle.  It's got like solar panels on it. 
[03:10:30]  It's the Mars Rover.  Short Circuit?  Yeah, yeah.  That was a good reference, actually.  Oh, it does kind of have a Johnny Five look to it.  Yeah, very good.  Well, we can't hear anything.  Dan, how's your headphones?  Waxy.  Do they sound good?  Yeah, I'm hearing all right.  Why do you have the only working headphones?  And what about you, dude?  Dude who should be holding a boom mic in Boogie Nights?  Is there a problem? 
[03:11:00]  That can be fixed.  I gave up on mine an hour ago, Mars.  That's funny.  Hello, hello?  No, these suck.  Yeah, these are awful.  There you go.  These suck.  We're just going headphone-less now?  Why don't we get Big A in here?  All right, there we go.  Let's get Big A in here.  We don't need headphones.  No, we don't need them.  Here comes Big A.  He's strutting, too.  He is.  That's where the audience is supposed to clap.  Big A, you know.  Oh, yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, our next guest on the show, Big A.  What a cocksmith.  Yeah. 
[03:11:30]  What's up, Big A?  Now, to be familiar with Big A, Big A, he's a taxi driver, but not like one of those New  York City taxi drivers.  I don't know what kind of shenanigans he's pulling, or the company he works for, but  it's just a car.  It's like, I'm sorry, it's a shitty car that drives around, and he picks people up, and  they pay him money to take him places.  And you drive in the Bronx?  Yes, I drive. 
[03:12:00]  I mean, our base is in the Bronx, but I drive all over, but the base is in the Bronx.  And did I mention he's got a speech impediment?  Yeah.  I forgot to mention.  Maybe that should have been first before what he does for a living.  He has a big problem saying words that start with S-T.  Yeah, give him an S-T word.  Watch.  This is fun.  Stethoscope.  Go ahead there.  Stethoscope.  Take your time. 
[03:12:30]  Thanks, I'm having trouble.  He just needs encouragement, that's all.  Maybe he sang it, would that help?  Some people, when they sing, they stutter better.  Yeah, yeah, but I'll tell us.  The doctor used a stethoscope.  Yeah, go ahead.  The doctor used a stethoscope.  I think I can get through it now.  You said stethoscope.  You said stethoscope.  No, no, I had trouble pronouncing the word.  Try a different S-T word, because I...  Oh, you want a different S-T word?  You have trouble what?  Pronouncing... 
[03:13:00]  Yes.  That's the beauty of it.  We don't want to give you a good one.  Say this then.  I'm shaped like a stegosaurus.  Go ahead.  I'm shaped like a...  Like a stegosaurus.  Wow.  Oh, jeez.  You can breathe again, people.  Isn't that rough?  Okay.  Well, that wasn't that bad.  All right, well, we've got...  The good news is stegosaurus doesn't come up that much in common. 
[03:13:30]  I mean, how often?  You can avoid it.  I'll have the stegosaurus.  You never hear that.  All right, well, Big A...  All the good news is...  Big A was married.  We find out was married.  Now, this is very surprising.  How old were you when you were married? 
[03:14:00]  It's not an S-T word.  I don't think any number starts with S-T.  Stevent.  Steventeen?  Maybe...  Actually, I'm thinking.  I was trying...  Ballpark.  How old a gentleman are you now?  That's good.  Forty.  Forty?  Approximately how many years ago did you get married?  Yeah, we'll do the math. 
[03:14:30]  Are you sure this is a speech-related problem?  Let's get him more comfortable.  Why don't you put your feet up?  Why don't you lean back?  Oh, that's a recliner.  Oh, cool.  Holy Jesus.  Wow.  That's great.  Wow, you fill up that chair pretty good, buddy.  You certainly do.  All right, so what?  Fourteen years ago you were married?  Someone fixed the lumbar on it.  It's pushing his belly out.  Oh, it doesn't have one.  All right, so around 26 you got married. 
[03:15:00]  Fourteen years ago, right?  How long were you married for?  About three years.  Three years?  That's relatively...  Is there a little big A running around out there?  No, no.  Oh, no kids.  Well, that would have been a coup.  So where did you meet the girl that you wound up marrying?  Oh, I met her up in Yonkers. 
[03:15:30]  I'm glad it wasn't Staten Island.  Where, Andrew?  Up in Yonkers.  No, okay, up in Yonkers.  And how did you first see her?  She was working at a Burger King.  And you went there a lot or you worked there too?  Oh, no, I was a customer.  Okay.  And she'd give you like an extra hat? 
[03:16:00]  A little Burger King crown.  So she worked at Burger King.  And what did she do there?  She was just a cash register girl?  I think she worked in the back.  So how did you finally meet her?  She took a break and...  And you duct taped her mouth shut and threw her in the trunk of your car.  You rolled her up in some indoor-outdoor carpeting.  Had her help him with a couch getting it in the van. 
[03:16:30]  Would you help me with this?  My arm's broke.  Would you?  So, okay, she took a break and you had seen her?  Did you guys make eye contact at each other?  Did you notice each other?  A couple of times.  A couple of times.  Yeah.  Okay, so she takes a break and...  What'd she look like, by the way?  Oh.  Here's a little description of her.  Good question.  If she looked like a celebrity or if she looked like somebody we might know, size, shape, what'd she look like?  Somebody that might have danced on a pole in this studio. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  How tall?  A little tall, I mean...  A little tall?  Andrew, relax.  A little small.  No, no, no, no, no.  She's bigger than a bread box.  You'd make a great witness.  Oh.  What'd she look like?  Oh, her head.  She was a little shorter than me. 
[03:17:30]  Okay.  How tall are you?  About six foot one, six two.  All right, so was she what, six foot or was she 5'9", 5'7"?  About 5'7", I think.  All right.  So you were a lot taller.  Yeah, a lot taller.  Color hair?  Dark.  Dark hair.  Round?  All right, wait, wait.  Was everything dark on her?  Yeah.  Oh, wait a minute. 
[03:18:00]  Was she an African-American?  Oh, no.  No?  She was from Trinidad.  Oh, so she was an African Trinidadian.  She wasn't, you know, I mean, you know, I mean, it's always, you know, shades of darkness  or shades of black.  Oh, boy.  You're a racist.  I don't see skin color.  Yeah, right.  So I don't, I don't, not in my neighborhood. 
[03:18:30]  Everyone's white.  How black?  Halle Berry black?  Yeah.  Yes.  Grace Jones black?  Oh, no, no, no.  Wesley Snipes?  Did she look like she could run a marathon?  Hmm.  Actually, more like, color of Halle Berry. 
[03:19:00]  All right, Halle Berry.  I really, dark, dark, you know, let's call her like brown.  Not dark, but you could, you could, you could tell that it wasn't just somebody with a good  tan.  She was a bit brown.  All right.  Nice body, nice booty.  What was your, what was the favorite part on, on her body for you?  Oh, my ass.  Was she a big girl, a small girl?  Not big at all, no.  She heavy?  No. 
[03:19:30]  What did she say, what would you say she weighed?  Five, seven, and black.  Oh, Jesus.  Like a hundred and a quarter?  All right, buck and a quarter at five, seven.  Okay.  So, wow, a kind of a thin girl there.  You guys made the number ten.  Yeah.  Well, how did, now, how did you, how did you talk to her now?  You said she went on break, you had looked at each other.  This is your first shot at really talking to her.  So what happened?  Um, we were just, you know, talking and getting, you know, each other and, and, um. 
[03:20:00]  You can't tell me.  What did you say to her when you approached her?  How did you approach her?  I was like, oh, 14 years ago, I don't. 
[03:20:30]  Sure you do.  You remember.  Of course you do.  No, you do remember.  Of course you do.  You do, like, so.  You remember how you met.  I understand.  You're embarrassed.  What, what, what happened?  Did you pay for it?  No, no.  Well, something's going on.  The Burger King.  How did you approach her?  What did you say?  You didn't just start talking?  Well, Whopper, please.  Where's my fries, bitch? 
[03:21:00]  What happened?  Yeah, come on.  What did you say to her?  First time you're, yeah.  First time you, you come in contact with her, how did you make the move to go first?  Brother.  Come on.  Do you remember?  Open your mind. 
[03:21:30]  Open your mind.  Did you take a thorn out of your foot?  What happened, Andrew?  I guess we were just talking about movies and just talking about each other.  Just talking about each other.  Casual conversation.  But standing up or did you sit down at a table at Burger King? 
[03:22:00]  Because if she works in the back, how'd you get in the back?  If she works in the back, how'd you get a front?  If she takes a break, where'd she go?  How did you sit down?  These are the questions people want answers to.  Right?  You want answers to that.  Yeah, maybe I do.  All right, so you meet her at Burger King.  You made some kind of move.  We'll never know what it is.  Because you don't remember?  How'd you ask her out for the first time?  How'd you say, where was your first date?  Yeah, there you go.  First date. 
[03:22:30]  Did she talk like Miss Cleo?  Did she?  Did she have an accent?  I see us getting married, man.  No, not like that, no.  Not like that at all.  Did she use you to stay in the country?  Was this a legitimate marriage?  Actually, it was legitimate.  I mean, she was getting the green card.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  How did you ask her out?  Mm-hmm. 
[03:23:00]  Um.  Um.  I just.  We asked her if she wanted to see a movie.  Did you leave her a choice?  Of course I did.  Okay.  What movie did you see?  What movie?  That I honestly forget.  Probably the one De Niro took his date to in Taxi Driver. 
[03:23:30]  Do you remember your first kiss with her?  Oh, yeah.  So where was it?  Oh, yeah.  By the friolator.  I think.  I think it was in my car.  Oh.  Okay.  You had gone on your first date.  Mm-hmm.  You're dropping her off?  Yeah.  Okay.  What happened?  Were you talking?  Were you thinking you wanted to kiss her? 
[03:24:00]  I think it was more like a, you know, goodnight kiss, you know.  Had a good time.  And a goodnight kiss.  All right.  But you started seeing each other more?  Got to step along with these goddamn stories, Jesus Christ.  Big A, come on.  So, Big A, you went out more with her, right?  Yeah.  More and more.  And then when did you realize that you wanted to marry this girl? 
[03:24:30]  How long after you met her?  Um, I think it was like a year.  So you've gone out for a year and you decide.  So you, did you pop the question?  You know.  Oh, yes, I did.  You did.  Do you.  Now, tell us a little about that.  How did that go?  Waiting for an answer. 
[03:25:00]  Oh, my God.  Just waiting for an answer any time.  This song.  How'd you do it?  You should just, like, when I say, so how did that go?  You should be like, well, I bought a ring at blah, blah, blah.  Then I went to this place and we did that.  You got to kind of, you know, you got to kind of give us a description.  Hold that mic yourself there.  There you go.  So what was the proposal like? 
[03:25:30]  Describe the proposal as if you were describing it to somebody who was going to write a story  or make a movie about it.  You need details.  Did you hide the ring in a fish witch?  No, I'm not.  Actually, I was in a park.  Okay, you're in a park.  Did you have the ring with you? 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, I had the ring with me.  Where'd you get the ring?  Penn Station?  I thought the thinker of a prostitute.  I forgot the place.  I forgot it.  You forgot the place.  You got it.  You don't remember much of anything about this, do you?  It's over 14 and he has a plane.  Yeah, I know. 
[03:26:30]  I remember shit from 14 years ago.  Trying to forget?  Trying to forget.  How'd you ask her?  That I know.  No one forgets.  Yeah, you're in the park.  You got the ring.  What'd you say?  Of course, my time came in front of her.  And I asked her if she wants to...  Go back to Trinidad or stay here. 
[03:27:00]  Someone's suggesting that you bought an onion ring for her.  And then someone else is saying that interviewing Big A is like interviewing a rock.  It's true.  Big A, this was...  You know, people have been looking forward to this for a while now.  You're killing us.  You're in the park.  You got the ring.  You get down on an onion.  What do you say to her?  This is a girl you've been kind of dating for a year, even though that's very suspicious at this point. 
[03:27:30]  So you knelt down in the front of her.  What'd you say?  And I asked her if she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me.  She wanted to marry me.  And she said yes?  Yes.  So where did you get married?  Actually, it was up in Yonkers. 
[03:28:00]  The romantic Yonkers.  Yeah, the wedding capital of the world, Yonkers.  I love that.  Come to Yonkers.  The raceway.  Actually, it wasn't a full wedding.  It was just...  It's more of a rape.  A rape with flowers and a piece of cake.  How long it takes to propose, as long as this interview? 
[03:28:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  Were you really in love with her?  Yes.  I was.  When did you realize she was using you?  Let's get to the...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, actually, how was the wedding?  Who was there?  Your parents?  Actually, no one.  It was at a judge's house.  Oh, you did one of those judge things where you'd just both go there.  Didn't you need a witness or something?  Um.  Her witch doctor. 
[03:29:00]  So you had no friends or family with you?  Nobody.  No, no.  It was just me and a judge's house.  So did you go out and have a honeymoon or anything?  What'd you do after?  Did you go celebrate somewhere?  Well...  The Bronx.  We didn't have, you know, time or money.  We went to Jamaica.  Queens.  Actually, we did go to Trinidad. 
[03:29:30]  Oh.  How do you go up to Trinidad?  It's a long flight.  It's a real long flight.  To meet her family?  Yes.  And what did they think of you?  Actually, they liked me.  How many goats did you have to give them?  Isn't that like something?  Dowry or whatever it's called.  Gotta give her some goats.  Give the family goats. 
[03:30:00]  Wait, when she brought you to meet her family,  did her father, like, put a harness on you  and ask to help pull something through a field?  Um, no, actually...  No, no.  A lot of people are saying that you're full of...  Shit.  Really?  Yeah.  Why would he be doing that?  What are you not telling, Big A?  Something's up here.  Yeah, you're not telling something.  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  Did he get paid to marry her or something?  Hmm.  One of those Bronx scams.  Ooh, I'm onto something.  What is it?  Ooh, I'm onto something.  He's giving me that evil eye.  Well, no, he's not.  He knows.  You're embarrassed.  Little free appetizer.  F.H. Riley's on the way for the right answer.  Wow.  I hit a nerve.  The Bronx is filled with scams 
[03:31:00]  all over the neighborhoods, man.  Mm-hmm.  Is this one of these scams?  Did you get paid to marry her?  Come on, how much?  Ooh, he's giving me the eye.  A couple of bucks.  Just don't strangle me, man.  Andrew, how much?  Andrew, a couple of bucks, right?  It happens.  They got to stay in the country.  We just got a little nod from him.  Yeah.  Was it, like, how much?  Did it set you up a little bit, or?  Oh, yeah, a little bit, yes. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah.  More than a thousand?  That's why he doesn't know how he approached her.  Right, right.  What kind of dates he went on.  This was just.  Because this was an arranged thing.  Yeah.  One of his buddies went, hey, you want to make a few easy dollars, you marry this broad.  Go to the judge's house.  She needs to be in the, she needs to be married for, what is it, two years?  Of course not.  And then she's free to go, right?  Did a buddy come up to you, one of your pals in the neighborhood, and say, hey, you want 
[03:32:00]  to make a few bucks?  You never went to Trinidad.  That's obvious.  I mean, what are you kidding?  Actually, I think I was.  You went to Trinidad?  When the INS was questioning you, did they just give up and frustrate?  Don't they usually, like, separate the couples there at which side of the bed, you know,  to make sure it's a legitimate marriage?  That's only, that's only if they don't believe you.  Why would they not believe you, Adam?  You know, this is.  No, no, no.  Only if. 
[03:32:30]  It does happen.  Yeah.  But this seemed a little fishy to begin with, so you would think that they would question  it, I would think.  Now, did you know, so you were going to make some money to marry her, so you marry her,  but did you wind up falling for her?  Yes, I did.  Oh, boy.  Did she fall for you, honestly?  A little bit, yes.  Okay.  A little bit.  So, how long were you married?  Three years.  Three years.  And how did it come to an end? 
[03:33:00]  We were always arguing, but the money, you know, it's always, it was always an argument  over money, you know?  Yeah.  And, and it just got too, too much.  You know, actually, last thing that happened, I was at a Met game, my parents and a friend 
[03:33:30]  of mine, and, and I called her up, she says, oh, what time are you going to be home?  I was like, I don't know if the game's over.  You know, um, and, and she was, you know, getting agitated, and, and she was like, oh, oh, you're 
[03:34:00]  not here at a certain time, or your fingers are going to be thrown out.  Oh, boy.  And, and, and, and, I was like, this is, you know, you know, uh.  Extra innings.  Mets fault.  You know, like, this is bullshit, so.  Um.  I came back, um, on a baseball game, and I called, I called the cops.  Mets win?  I don't know.  Just thought I'd ask.  why'd you call the cops um get my things out she was throwing you out
