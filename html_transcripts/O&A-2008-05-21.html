<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a comedic audio bit, "Meet the McGregors," depicting child abuse.  The hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, along with Colin Quinn filling in for the absent Anthony Cumia, immediately launched into speculation about Cumia and traffic reporter Jill Nicolini's simultaneous sick days, fueled by rumors of a date the previous night – dubbed "Anthelini Gate 08."  This involved a humorous dissection of suggestive text messages allegedly sent by Cumia, filled with crude language detailing a night of heavy drinking and implied sexual activity.  Jill Nicolini's father called in, adding to the chaotic, humorous speculation with colorful commentary and concerns about his daughter's well-being, also revealing details about her past dates.  The segment included multiple listener calls offering theories on Cumia and Nicolini's whereabouts, with one caller using the phrase "moaned her all night long."  Interspersed were discussions about a free gas promotion, logistical challenges, and a vetoed humorous idea from lawyers; news stories about Senator Ted Kennedy's impending death and conspiracy theories surrounding it;  the California budget crisis and a proposed pornography tax; R. Kelly and a sex tape; a caller whose son was deploying to Iraq; Colin Quinn's ban from USO tours; and a man arrested for DUI who repeatedly requested the officer scratch his testicles.  David Tell, the new *Garg Show* host, was a guest in the studio for a portion of this part of the show.

Further into the broadcast, Cumia's sick call was played, highlighting his "swishy" voice and Nicolini's seemingly suggestive comment about wanting to throw up.  More discussion about text messages and calls from Nicolini's family ensued.  David Tell remained in the studio for some time before being joined by Uwe Boll, a German film director. Boll discussed his new movie, *Postal*, its limited release, his boxing matches with critics, his filmmaking process, and opinions on other directors and films, including Michael Bay's *Pearl Harbor* and *Transformers*, and the Indiana Jones franchise.  The show continued to promote the free gas giveaway and also discussed a controversial billboard campaign featuring partially nude women.  The hosts later discussed movies that underperformed despite critical acclaim, using *Before the Devil Knows You're Dead* as an example. This led to a German-speaking guest translating a four-year-old pornographic audio clip described as containing chicken sounds; the guest also discussed differences between American and German pornography and anecdotes from his Romanian film work.  A caller expressed dislike for Uwe Boll, prompting discussion of Boll’s controversial films and his experiences in Germany. The conversation touched upon German legal restrictions on Nazi imagery and Holocaust denial, the Cannes Film Festival, and risk-taking in European versus American cinema.  Calls continued, discussing Marissa Tomei's appearance in *Before the Devil Knows You're Dead* and questions about Boll's films, before Cumia finally called in, giving graphic details of his heavily intoxicated date with Nicolini, revealing that the date was ongoing. This included details about planned cat neutering and the potential existence of pictures and videos from the date. The segment ended with an emergency broadcast system test interruption.

A substantial portion of the show featured Andrew "Dice" Clay as a guest in the studio. The hosts discussed a recent, lengthy on-air conversation with Clay stemming from Clay's upcoming appearance on Jim Norton's HBO show. They detailed a long-standing feud, stemming from an incident involving Clay's son, exacerbated by his divorce. They addressed negative listener responses, criticizing those who dismissed Clay's explanation or questioned their motives.  The hosts emphasized Norton's proactive effort to mend fences, highlighting their shared history and professional respect for Clay.  There were heated exchanges with a listener named "Flea," who was repeatedly insulted for criticizing their handling of the Dice situation.  The segment also mentioned that Than, a show employee, was leaving to pursue comedy.  Finally,  the hosts discussed a recent benefit show and Opie's rescheduled wedding.

The broadcast concluded with a segment on a "runner-up line of the day," focusing on a comedian, Colin, described as a "prop act."  The hosts found amusement in Colin's success despite their criticisms, making humorous comments about his eating habits.  A female guest was briefly mentioned, followed by a crude and incomplete sentence about her and a description of an arm wrestling match at the table with Adam.

[00:27:30]  mess with jim newton on those controls that's right he's found a new toy so then the uh the phone  call continued i just want to know like uh is this going to be safe you're taking my daughter out  i heard a lot of stories about opie and anthony well you know something the on-air persona is uh a lot  different than off the air unbelievable right he's selling everybody out yeah blaming us for talking  about i don't blame the guy it sounds like one of those wiretaps when they went after like the  trash route pickups in long island it's like hey i'll come to huntington listen to me 
[00:28:00]  everybody's in the union what's your problem uh yeah you know we're we're considered shock jocks  uh by some and off the air though i mean you know way people say oh you kiss your mother with that  mouth i go yeah you know i'm a very family-oriented guy i uh that's racist he's trying to relate to the  italians i'm a family-oriented guy you kiss your mother he's trying to get like back to the old days  of course he is the old expressions instead of what he is a decadent new york snob yeah 
[00:28:30]  yeah filth bag who hates children that's this is why you kiss your mother you know all the old  adages there buddy what's an adage oh nothing sir family-oriented guy i uh i i like uh making  people happy uh having having fun creep so i i honestly you have nothing to worry about sir  i'll treat your daughter with the utmost respect okay because uh that's my baby that's my that's  my youngest oh yeah it's kind of fun to listen to this today knowing that uh the day went very well 
[00:29:00]  to the point where she called in sick he called in sick yeah and here we got the dad from yesterday  calling her black lady her dead body after a plummet 40 stories right now they're both naked in a bed  and she had to turn him over because he was choking at his own vomit i like making people happy and  having fun you always know when anthony gets like a little nervous and uncomfortable yeah because he  kind of talks like this a little clipped it's actually like sweet like a little boy like his 
[00:29:30]  little arms go straight okay good yes sir like okay mr jimmy jackson please don't hurt me anymore  like he's 10 years old again talking to his mommy that's exactly what it is yeah well she's gonna  she's discovering the other side anthony right about now yeah i'll be right now she's looking  at him naked she probably just woke up and she's just looking at it lay across his leg and i can't  believe that's what it looks like but it's not even being affected yeah big sloppy that's my that's my  youngest oh yeah and i got another question for you say you and my daughter start going out and this 
[00:30:00]  and that i'd like to know a little bit about your um ideas of a family if you like a family like you  said you do but i'm still talking about your own family oh yeah well it's been a dream of mine  uh i like that's one of my first grandchild i'm looking to have more grandchildren with my other  kids and uh sure what do you think of i'm just thinking i'm saying to you what are you thinking of  uh i want to have a more offspring more grandchildren what are you thinking of 
[00:30:30]  have you ever married my daughter i uh sir i have i have a very big house and nothing would do my  heart better than to see a bunch of uh little kids running around and having fun and uh having  the shame and anger of my childhood what a phony he's like sir i'm from ronconcoma from a family  of italians that look like north africans we were brutalized emotionally and physically  what do you think's gonna happen i'm gonna have two nice happy years and i'm gonna destroy my kids 
[00:31:00]  without even trying trying so hard not to do what was done to me yeah somehow doing it another way  a bunch of uh little kids running around and having fun and uh having uh of course uh you over as a  grandfather uh sure i love children he's so distanced from saying that it's like watching he's  watching a tv show having children and fun and you over yeah oh what a sociopath he really is like 
[00:31:30]  he believes any of that stuff yeah what do you think is going on right now is uh he's asleep he's  passed out he's just passed out i thought he tried to spin it too like yeah i won't be in tomorrow  it'll make great radio yeah yeah mind your business about great radio unless you're here exactly yeah  it'll make for great radio so you're saying we do great radio without you yeah how about your  videotape and let us watch and we can comment on it great video yeah that'll make for great video  and radio yeah but uh what do you what do you think she's doing it's probably the same thing 
[00:32:00]  they're probably both asleep they probably both laughed she probably called it like three o'clock  in the morning with the message same thing anthony did but she's she's a lot younger and i i think  she could handle her uh her booze a little better at this point than anthony can i bet you she's like  god i called in sick for this i mean i had fun and all but now i got the whole day to myself she's  probably already out and about doing stuff it'd be funny if she woke up and then she looked over  and she's like oh my god that's right i thought it was opie like you're the one that she liked yeah 
[00:32:30]  he showed up and she was too polite to say anything so she kept drinking sambuca  it's true anthony's got like a kind of you know like a primal attractiveness to him but  no girl's gonna say i have a crush on him unless it's opie you're right yeah because opie looks like  her ex-boyfriend the hockey player wipe i'm saying it was brian leach brian leach because  he kind of reminds me of op i heard that i heard there was a garth snow in uh in her past who used  to uh be one of the goalies for the islanders here we go more of uh jill's dad hot van sucks 
[00:33:00]  well what do you drive i'm just you don't mind me asking uh i don't like asking questions but i'm  asking the one question well way to break the stereotype of italians yeah what are you driving what  are you driving what do you drive he does want to find out what this guy's about but i'm asking the  one question uh well i have two vehicles uh one is my i have a cadillac escalade and then the other  one is a shelby uh mustang oh nice you got nice equipment because uh calls it nice equipment 
[00:33:30]  nice equipment mr nicolini most fathers uh what are your values what do you like what are you driving  these days to make him a better answer like a van with blacked out windows  mustang oh nice you got nice equipment because uh that's true the caddy there sounds pretty good  what one of the girls one of the guys my daughter was going out with the hockey player gart had one 
[00:34:00]  fred had one another guy she was going out with barf to say had jesus fred who you hear this for  durst he didn't say he didn't say i gotta go backwards because no guy and and obviously no  girl wants to hear the list of uh ex-boyfriends or or ex-girlfriends tough to sit through this he  played a god that one fred had one another guy she was going out with barf to say had jesus  just run through the list why don't you forget about it i take this thing out it hits the floor

[00:36:00]  all right no problem sir my pleasure have a nice day all right there goes uh mr nicolini  mr nick all right all right man bye bye bye sir all right uh up what a couple of by the way why  wouldn't they go on their date on a friday or a saturday like what a couple of luscious like when  do you want to go tuesday let's go tuesday what was it monday well today's wednesday so yes tuesday  night they were on their date they don't have both of them uh don't have a concept of responsibility 
[00:36:30]  whatsoever they have immediate gratification yes it's not even in their vocabulary the word  responsibility it's like tuesday is like a friday or saturday to how do you know that about her just  you know it about him because she went out on the tuesday when she has to get up early  right he probably called her when you want to go out uh now okay i'm on my way that's the way they  did it they're like they're like two characters in idiocracy  let's say hi to jerry the trucker jerry  happy birthday yemi hi thank you jerry ron and pez number three bravo what do you got buddy 
[00:37:00]  i'm just wondering why jimmy hasn't worn out the liar button because honestly i'm not sure where  all the buttons are and fan could be helping me i don't know where all the buttons are to be honest  i'm just doing i'm trying to make my way okay dope yeah i don't think we have to even say that  anthony came up with an excuse to not be here today i said it yesterday i'm like all right should we just  not come in uh you know tomorrow we all knew he wouldn't make it after the big date with jill 
[00:37:30]  well you know anthony shouldn't be drinking uh on a uh tuesday night you lack discipline  or he could do the alternative sorry  he could do the alternative socially drink like a normal person tuesday and then show up for his job  let's go to tony in brooklyn have we tried calling anthony i think we've tried but uh nothing right 
[00:38:00]  voicemail uh voicemail well do you think this is you think this is from their daily a little bit  of audio from their date last night all right try the wine all right you're back jimmy thank you  tony brooklyn what do you got fast forward a couple years and you're gonna see uh anthony like  nice he had a casual sex where he's got a puppy for the girls everything like that yeah yeah right  all right punch it out all right and it's gonna have to deal with like little kids little  doggies no he doesn't know what he's getting himself into uh let's go to jimmy on long island 
[00:38:30]  jimmy yeah uh what you don't know is i gotta be really quiet because i'm outside the hotel  right now anthony is inside the hotel in a bunny suit with the ass ripped out going why it was only  supposed to be a bit it's a linger longer call linger longer one of our little uh scenarios we like to  you know talk about from time to time the guy who decides like he's had the perfect life but  decides to get a hooker on the road like a business guy gets the hooker he's in some weird bunny 
[00:39:00]  costume and it goes horribly wrong and the hooker's dead and now he has to get rid of the body  oh it's the blood out of the bunny suit and bring it back yeah it's a whole thing but i did the whole  phone's vibrating on the on the uh dresser in the hotel room he knows it's his wife talk about  talk about his son's uh little league game or something he was only gonna do it once one time  only but don't we kind of feel like that's what's happening with jill like she can't believe  she's got this smitten psychopath next to her yeah she's probably just meant to be a goof 
[00:39:30]  like to her friends get her to do it she's like yeah i'll go out why not  it's a john hughes movie it was a bet anthony a lousy bet according to anthony she might be a  little smitten what's anthony exactly he can't see he can't see like she's just knows how to work  this no she's just shaking and she's like oh she's got that forced smile on her face her eyes  getting a darting look of like a trapped rat like oh boy another one bites the dust he's yapping 
[00:40:00]  remember we talked about last night she's like yeah no it's like oh she's like a regis and kelly  kind of thing where we have our own show eventually i really hope that the night traffic hope it ended  up in a hotel with him just like laying there kind of humiliated making excuses i guess i drank too  much i don't think it's all right then he goes no really shoes i said it's all right i should just  go home and he's like i'm not i don't feel right to drive and she just kind of fell asleep and he just  sat there and punched it oh all right uh colin quinn in for anthony jimmy uh working anthony's

[00:41:00]  not wasting any time ovulating means you can't get pregnant oh yeah all right thank you yeah that  was probably her thing she probably had it all figured out that's why they didn't go out right away  really she had her little chart so she had to look at so instead of popping over to the columbia  school of medicine she decided her offspring would be anthony a beat-up air conditioning repairman  got money though who made good she wants to spawn to be uh you know to be handy

[00:48:30]  what happened uh well breaking news well rush and malloy they write the gossip column for the daily  news and they had a little piece on the anthony jill nicolini thing yesterday uh just wrote uh coach  mike with this anthony better watch out i heard that the hockey player she went out with ended up 
[00:49:00]  with his johnson crazy glued to his thigh what did anthony i love her even more now i know she  especially knowing anthony's johnson she's probably got like a paint roller with glue on it  oh is that a monster oh yeah it's awful well yeah we're speculating that it's got to be just  ridiculous once again good get rid of that stupid i am screen please thank you anthony better watch  out i heard that the hockey player she went out with ended up with his uh johnson crazy glue to his 
[00:49:30]  thigh jesus yeah yeah something is not right here yeah i really hope that anthony has something  unpleasant happening to him as much as i love anthony but i'm jealous you think he's like just nude and  then chained uh to his to a wall somewhere we got to go find him now yeah she probably uh she  probably put on that special belt that real submissives like and uh you know they gave him  the business with his face in the video and uh old pillow biter anthony we got david tell he's 
[00:50:00]  going to be joining the show in a few minutes here um well we predicted this yesterday on the show i said  this are we taking tomorrow off why would we take tomorrow off well the only thing uh we've never  been known to uh to uh indulge a little too much a little drink you're supposed to were you hoping  for us to like support you on that no you're right anthony you've never done that before 
[00:50:30]  oh that was yesterday of course he was going to take today off we knew that yeah i'm just bummed  that i got a massive allergy attack happening all this amazing stuff is going on oh we have to hear  about what this what happened how can he not pick up the phone maybe he's just he's kidding me he  she wrecked them think they're banging uh yeah colin yeah maybe either that or they're playing 
[00:51:00]  like uh i don't know like uh some kind of board game well maybe the uh hockey player came over he  didn't get glued and he's just like a psychopath right now anthony's being checked into like a  high-rise window in long island city just getting checked into every wall yeah he looks like he looks  like a bug smashed against the window and she's like get off him get off i'm serious oh god i just  don't think this is gonna end well now let's say hi to rich in the bronx rich you know what's going  on y'all hey buddy y'all are terrible how y'all gonna hate on the man he's got he's got a nice little 
[00:51:30]  sweet piece there he's having a good time y'all just destroying him y'all terrible no we're not  destroying him but uh we want to know what happened he kind of uh teased everybody he leaves a message  he doesn't tell us what's going on and uh he doesn't come in we we want to hear it's like how  do you leave a setup like that with no conclusions and uh we warned him yesterday that he better get  his ass in here or it's going to just be us piling on and making fun of him and he's not going to be  able to defend himself yeah and that's exactly what's going on today oh look that new traffic 
[00:52:00]  girl's doing a great job too look at that traffic i bet jill misses she's not in the middle of that  look at that thing yeah look at that uh let's say hi to kevin the trucker kevin  hello sir hey you've been you've been teasing us for the last two weeks and somebody's leaving  the show at the end of the month now we know who it is it's anthony you think i think so i think he's  i think he's in vegas right now probably getting married yep there'd be nothing that made me happier 
[00:52:30]  if he just eloped and got married in a drunken stupor and then had to try to tell like all right  forget it if this was like a thursday i think he would have been done for the week and uh by monday  or tuesday whenever we uh do the next show because i think we're taking monday off uh there'd be a  whole crazy story we went to atlantic city we're gambling we uh yeah they're gonna end up marriage  something crazy let's go ahead kyle no i'm saying so far the dynamic is definitely anthony in love  and this girl not realizing what she's gotten she probably had a crush on him and now she sees his 
[00:53:00]  amorous needy look and she's disgusted yeah that turns a woman off when they look up to you in a  way or they like you and they own you all of a sudden that easily that's right yeah but this guy  wasn't hard to get and he was primed for it yeah he's got those big sick cow eyes looking at her  right now where are we going for breakfast i don't know she's looking at the traffic like oh i wish i  was reporting on this yeah i should just be doing the traffic today he's talking that little he's like  you hungry baby she's just like yuck yeah yeah little boy's voice 
[00:53:30]  it was like this it was fun but i i'm just gonna go shopping for the rest of the day you think you  think the doe eyes are turning her off yeah yeah yeah uh hanky connecticut what's up hey i just  wonder if uh anthony's tied up in a basement somewhere and jill's got the radio show on linger  longer linger longer my friend has anybody tried to call her yeah can we call her she's up 
[00:54:00]  she's young man she's she's still in the prime of her uh party and you know life i don't like the  way jim said that like a detective in a movie of the week has anyone tried to call her that's the  real angle well you solve the case shut up you solve the case i'll use that button on you what  button just push one colin open your mouth you're paying for it you eat it wow  steve c is calling jill no answer all morning that was because you're a disgusting fat body 
[00:54:30]  you just didn't even know what you were putting i know i didn't love it and it kind of worked out  right because you are a disgusting fat body by the file he dresses he tries to pass off because  i'm too happy sir yeah yeah i love that yeah that the soft language he gives himself like it's in  it's like it's just a little incidental thing i've put on a few pounds uh someone is suggesting that  jill is having anthony do the silence of the lambs uh dance right now he sounded like uh what's his name 
[00:55:00]  when he called in just now oh um could you please yeah his voice went a little uh yeah a little uh  he sounded like the guy  remember yes i love it why are we playing oh we're just playing the song this is silence of the land  new water right yeah it's called uh horses something right i think what is it goodbye horses oh goodbye  horses sure all right let's go to jason in carolina jason you're on the opian anthony show 
[00:55:30]  hey boys i was wondering what's worse open uh anthony having to deal with her dad or jill having to  deal with the millions of fans and pests how is she dealing with all the pests just just our little  how nosy we are how we want to know and it's just killing us it's just it's sad yeah someone said it  i mean we all feel like we're dating jill nicolini so you know anthony owes us he owes us some information  now yeah it was killing me i had to know and i got four text messages i i read them uh this morning 
[00:56:00]  but i had to put a lot of blanks in there i think the suffocation she feels is not based on the pests  yet it's just on anthony and his lovesick look she's probably laying in bed she's probably wide awake  looking at the ceiling looking at his dumb arm across her chest and just wanting him to be gone  he probably likes to cuddle when he sleeps oh and she just wants to be untouched and left alone  oh god what is going on right he's waking up with morning breath probably trying to do  can you baby you hungry baby he's like no jill's voicemail is full can't leave any more 
[00:56:30]  oh that's great oh yeah something bad happened last night she left um he took it out she freaked out  and left and he kept calling her and calling her calling her and she promised she'd call  i promised i'll call and her friend's like you didn't call back please call now we're starting  to get worried you know doorman she's not in something really bad happened yeah uh remember  yesterday the mcgregors yes do we have the original mcgregors audio basically uh some some video clip 
[00:57:00]  about what teaching the kids what uh what pedos are all about there jimmy it was a psa uh i know i was  here yesterday stupid well we'll explain to the audience not you dumbbell where is that private  pile sir jelly donuts sir colin i'm sorry i did that yeah oh i'm embarrassed that i did that now  jimmy fights you back with that button see what's going on here yeah it's like a like a button war 
[00:57:30]  going on colin's reaching over and just randomly pushing buttons and then jimmy's uh responding yeah  well try another one there colin go ahead just randomly push one don't even look puss oh come on  us i've made an ass of myself open your mouth they're paying for it you eat it you pushed that  one already but that's the best one i didn't push it on purpose i'm my opposite down uh jared  connecticut said yeah i didn't realize you were opposite down jared hey hey the question isn't if 
[00:58:00]  they did it the question is does anthony have the stamina and how many times did they do it  hopefully once and it was over in about i'd say 15 seconds or less i think they did it i think  she enjoyed it last night but then this morning he's like how about a little morning thing she's  like oh i can't believe this is my pattern i talk about this with my friends i get some guy involved  and he likes me i want him disgusted by him and i want him out i think uh she's at that stage i think  anthony was proud of himself because he went maybe three four times yeah and she said oh that's adorable 
[00:58:30]  that's cute like you know she was expecting a lot more than that i like i think jimmy really hit the  nail on the head she was expecting opie i mean let's face it mc foley is the uh right he's the one  to put them together yeah you know he may give the wrong message yeah well no well she talked and she  asked for anthony but she probably doesn't listen to the show much she probably heard it a couple of  times and her friends always you know say oh he's cute or anthony's whatever yeah she mixed them up in  her head yeah let's say hi to mark and then he walked in and she was like uh-huh 
[00:59:00]  come on your cow's a blank a white slavery uh ringleader let's say hi to mark in new york mark  hey mark hey guys anthony if you can hear me please don't wash your fingers until you get back to the  show oh boy oh boy when does this stop being a bit i i don't think it's either gonna be jill's father  like gives us the quote warning right or ankles dude this is really becoming something real so uh 
[00:59:30]  we're gonna have to somehow figure out how to get out of this i just like the fact he says anthony  if you're listening like anthony is a little too ill to make it in but he's awake and concerned with  the radio show and listening and jotting down suggestions maybe for tomorrow  well are you well concerned hey if you guys need to do a best of yeah or you can go in and do the show  yourself can we thanks anthony what a creep uh mcgregor so i i gotta play a couple of these clips  again because because a new bit has begun we got a uh a production piece called meet the max oh all 
[01:00:00]  right so just uh just quickly here's uh the mcgregors it's hard to talk about but well here goes  see my mom works so mom used to pay mrs mcgregor to keep me at her house after school there was a  bunch of kids like me at her house every day it was a neat place because mrs mcgregor always had  treats and stuff for us kids and sometimes mr mcgregor would come home early we all liked him we called 
[01:00:30]  him mr mack and sometimes he'd pick one special boy and take him out to his workshop i've got a  special job for you today  oh won't that be fun  uh mrs mcgregor just bugs me every time i hear her oh won't that be fun my favorite is the reaction of the  kids when mr mcgregor shows up you'd think like a superhero just walked in the room and apparently  he's been sexually abusing everybody in the neighborhood and yet they can't get enough of 
[01:01:00]  mr mcgregor when he shows up instead of like a collective like oh like oh no why does mommy have to work  yeah they're all happy and in the background he's like hey kids all gather around like  he'd take me to his workshop in the garage and teach me woodworking  sawing hammering and stuff oh we didn't have i like getting work from the other kids you know  and mr mack called me his number one helper  slow and steady that's the way jake i'd work hard and get hot sometimes i take my shirt off 
[01:01:30]  let's take your shirt off mr mack said that's what a man does when he's working hard  yeah we'll get you cleaned up mr mack is a creep  so far everything he said is true though you do take your shirt off when a man works hard  yeah no one said mr mack doesn't make valid points  yeah but uh it's a bit on the creepy side  one of the authors jill is stuck in someone's workshop right now  that's it take your shirt off jill with an original copy of the versailles agreement 
[01:02:00]  staring at her from the ceiling  and she's handcuffed with a pair of like world war one german army  baby that's better  one day i was painting this birdhouse i helped build  yep it's really shaping up thanks here let me help  now you missed a spot right up there 
[01:02:30]  oh no mr mcgregor spilled paint on me i mean really spilled paint all over me and my clothes  just take off your clothes go on take them off i'll help you clean up  this is leading to something don't worry because we played these clips yesterday  creepy right yeah it's hard to see if he's being creepy or helpful  what do you think colin 
[01:03:00]  uh you know i don't want to judge in america you don't prejudge nowadays  all right  so i did i mean i had paint all over me so it made sense  that them  but then something weird happened  now i'm going to take a picture to remember the day we spilled the paint  i don't really want to  oh it's okay jake all the other boys do it look  william wallace  he had pictures of all the boys in daycare 
[01:03:30]  and they were all naked but that wasn't the worst  there now i'll help you clean up  huh  what's that haircut  which one the boy  yeah horrendous  that's good you're picking up the important part of the video  he looks like katie lang  and then finally  yeah that feels good doesn't it 
[01:04:00]  it didn't feel good  it felt gross  i always thought i know what to do at that spot but  when it was happening  well i didn't do anything  that hellhole book  you know bud  man looks into the abyss  when he sees staring back at him  what happened to me  the pictures  the touching  he was wrong  it was not my fault  it's called sexual abuse  i don't know where you get your information son 
[01:04:30]  but i don't like it  so uh we've been having fun with that audio  as another sneeze comes on here  um  we uh put this together  meet  the max  so we're trying to take that audio  this is the first one so far  and make something else out of it there colin  okay  coming up next on an all new meet the mcgregors  mr mack invites over robbie from next door to build a birdhouse  i've got a special job for you today  oh and steady  that's the way 
[01:05:00]  but mr mack has been drinking bourbon all afternoon  and has a few other ideas  now you missed a spot right up there  that silly drunk spills paint all over young robbie  guess who doesn't have a change of clothes  just take off your clothes  i'll help you clean up  yeah that feels good doesn't it  someone better call the authorities  mr mcgregor has another naked boy in his house  now i'm going to take a picture  to remember the day we spilled the paint 
[01:05:30]  yeah that's what the cops call exhibit a  the fun really starts when mrs mcgregor comes home  and finds a dirty shoebox full of polaroids under the bed  it all goes down tonight  on meet the mcgregors  steve couldn't have been happier  no no kidding  that's that's what's creepy about that too  steve you had fun making that right  yeah  are you uh calling anthony and jill 
[01:06:00]  and uh where are we at with this whole thing  um well  you heard that jill's mailbox is full on her phone correct  right  all right well  you heard it on the show that you work on  yeah  oh  forgive me  for just clarifying something  i will never do it again colin  i almost missed what seat you were in  um  the uh  i've been calling both of them dozens of times  sending dozens of text messages  they're out cold  you think they're just passed out at this point  yeah  did you call anthony's home number  uh do you have it

[01:07:00]  i think that they probably went to bed early  you know  and uh  maybe 10 o'clock  and they woke up at 4  and it goes  i'm not feeling too well  she said you better call in  and maybe she has it too  and then went home  oh and right now he's like  let's get married at the taj  yeah  and they're driving down ac  and she's sobering up  and realizing  oh god i just want to be at work  yeah  away from this  obsessed creep  he's prattling on  you know actually  the jersey shows  the new hamptons  let's say hi to somebody in texas

[01:10:30]  before he gives  what he says  translation  that means  he's got the  Louisville slug  who's looking for  Anthony right now  translation  she writes his  lines for him  oh yeah  that's translation  iron man rocks  am I right  we're my nerds  come on let's go  Dave  you hit it  the nail on the head  maybe that's what  they did  they went to see  a late night  iron man screening  sure  talking about it  David  yeah  I went to see  forgetting Sarah Marshall  oh you did  I heard that's 
[01:11:00]  the new Juno  I like that  smart comedy too  we have a  uh  a plug from  uh  coach Mike  stunt brain  he's sitting over there  we're gonna do a  gas promotion  yeah  exactly  that's the reaction  I was hoping for  what is it  we're gonna give away  free gas tomorrow  like radio stations  they  like Hillary Clinton  look how sad  Jim is  he's like  finally this is my chance  I'm bumped up  Colin comes in  and steals it all  yeah  and I'm his boss today  can you believe it 
[01:11:30]  you can send me  what has to happen  for Jim to be the  uh  the second guy  I don't want to sit  over there  you're afraid of success  I like where I'm sitting  I don't want  I don't  I like the angle  I look at Opie this way  it's too weird for me  to sit in another seat  see  he blew it Dave  because we  we invited Colin in  right  Colin  he's an opportunist  he ran right for  Anthony's seat  yeah  Jimmy  just  just  went to his own seat  that's the problem  so officially now  Colin is  Jimmy's boss today  well 
[01:12:00]  so Colin  was  you were  you were booked  no  they just called me  at the 530  yeah  that's what I figured  like a  like an old law and order  we need you  come in  yeah  she's like  I gotta go  honey  I gotta go  Colin lives very close  so we just put out  the signal  and he's running over  he hasn't even showered  well  yes I did  he came right from the gym  I showered  did you really  of course  I don't wake up  unless I shower  seriously  it really does  give you an eye opener  funny for me  it's coffee  that is funny 
[01:12:30]  let's go to Mike  you know ladies  we don't get together  the way we used to  let's go to Mike  for a second  because we're giving away  free guests  before the long weekend  why are we doing  witty soccer mom banter  what's up Mike  tomorrow morning  7 and 9  we're giving away gas  free KROQ gas  we bought it  it's going to be at  Luke Oil  on Route 17 South  in Rutherford New Jersey  and on Sunrise Highway  in Wontaw  the 3229 Sunrise  we bought the gas  we're giving it away  it's a KROQ ONA production  they got a real gentle pump  over there  yeah 
[01:13:00]  make sure you  I heard Muhammad's  got a heavy hand  come on  come watch it  he'll distract you  7am  show up  we'll start giving it away  free gas tomorrow  free gas  no goofy  92 cent  a gallon  things  other radio stations  they've been using  their call letters  for the gas price  so we want to just  shut everyone up  it's free gas tomorrow  and then everyone  can just stop  the dumb gas promotions  she called it  ass gas or grass  nobody arrives for free  hello 1978  mom banter  we had an idea  but the lawyers  kind of wrecked it 
[01:13:30]  we were going to  give you free gas  as long as you could  give us gas  on the spot  but what about my idea  you give free gas  you make Norton dress  in a Hillary pantsuit  with clip on earrings  I don't like that idea at all  I like my idea  the marathon man promotion  where you can take  all the free gas  you can drink  let's say hi  to Travis in New Hampshire  Travis what's up  what's up boys  hey  Greg audio  hey listen  I just want to know  are you guys going to  sell tickets  so that we can all  line up  I speak for all 
[01:14:00]  listeners by the way  where we can line up  and smell Ant's fingers  well we did tell Anthony  he has to come in  with her panties  kind of like  not Revenge of the Nerds  pretty in pink  oh she doesn't wear  panties  she's a radio woman  no she does TV  she's a TV girl  oh really  she's very attractive  I really hope  that we're building this up  and maybe they kissed  at the end of the night  and Anthony is just  hung over and alone  and she's just depressed  because she can't  believe she kissed that zero  didn't you hear  in her next room

[01:20:00]  I heard all this  yesterday  it's the first time  I heard about this  so  right  alright well  we're patiently  waiting for somebody  to check in  either Anthony  or Jill  we want your  father to call in  but she's trying  to hunt down  Jill right now  does she drink  a lot  Anthony  does she drink  a lot  she don't  drink a lot  but when she  drinks  she can keep  up with me  so  alright cool  we call it  a periodic  yeah  like occasionally  they drink  for three or  four days  tear  yeah  I try to get  in touch with  her  I'll call my  pastor  I try to get  in touch with  Jill  yeah we want to  hear from one of  them before the

[01:21:00]  of Ted Kennedy  with the  inoperable  brain tumor  there Dave  hilarious  it's sad  it's the end  of an era  something else  and you know  what was it  first  it was  they thought  it was  it was  something else  a headache  it was like  yeah  a headache  oh my hat's  too tight  yeah  too much ice cream  and then  the worst thing  ever  yeah  I love how  the papers  are saying  it's the  Kennedy curse  you know  oh that's  part of the  curse  yeah they  can't give  up on this  whole Kennedy  curse  no people  just end up  dying  when they  get old  maybe it's 
[01:21:30]  the head  though  because JFK  and I think  RFK got shot  in the head  and then Ted  Kennedy has a  brain tumor  so maybe  they're saying  it's that  well wouldn't  that be amazing  if somebody came  and tried to  shoot it right  out  you know  the tumor  like kind of  threw it up  in the ear  like a card  on the gong show  that's the act  we're looking for  I'm happy to hear  you're going edgy  with the gong show  you think so  yes absolutely  well I hope  Chuck Barris  gets involved  because he really  is he's the man  you know  have you ever  had him in here  no  he would be  a great guest  CIA  I didn't know  you're still alive 
[01:22:00]  you think that's  true  I read the whole book  it sounded kind of  true when he said it  wait what's the deal  with him  he said he was in  the CIA the whole time  like a secret CIA agent  but I read that  whole book  so it's either  he's the greatest  gets a writer  or he really wasn't  it  we get it  you're a reader  yeah  I mean I read  the entire  Chuck Barris book  you can throw that  in our faces  yeah really  you guys ever check out  naked underneath my clothes  I've got a dumb reader  on our hands  I'm trying to get through  the Richard Lewis book  what's that called 
[01:22:30]  it's the Richard Lewis  it's an autobiography  yeah  do you really  the other  great depression  yeah that's it  there you go  oh cause  it's an airport book  wait you really knew  the name Colin  yeah  I'm sure he's read it  it's a funny name  did you read it  I didn't read it but  we're gonna have to  have it  many addictions  alright  I read the Amorous Busboy  of Decatur Evan  and that was good  wow  he really  Colin is one of the  smartest guys  Robert Klein  that was a good book too  you liked that one  no I didn't read that one  see I do do impressions  Robert Klein  what would have happened 
[01:23:00]  if Robert Klein and Nixon  had done that  well I'd like to order  okay  I don't know  cause that was Reagan  yeah you just did Reagan  yeah it was Reagan  yeah but Reagan's  perfect for everything  oh it's hilarious  Nixon is when you  graduated high school  Reagan is six years after  I'm starting to think  you're like more of  a middle reliever  yeah  instead of a  starting pitcher  you're good for  about three innings  yeah great fellas  I'll come back  and do this again  no one expects you  I want to come in  at six in the morning  no one expects you

[01:30:00]  the military  and just  as a country  we stink  Bush had to apologize  over a US soldier  shooting a Koran  he apologized  to Iraq's Prime Minister  for American sniper  shooting of a Koran  and the Iraqi government  called US military commanders  to educate their soldiers  to respect local  religious beliefs  wow  and it irritates me so much  because Colin  who wants to go to Iraq  and I went to Iraq with  because he didn't respect  the culture  is banned  from going back to Iraq  that's ridiculous 
[01:30:30]  what you're banned  from Iraq  yeah I'm banned  from yeah  USO tours  in the Middle East  why  what did you do  I don't know  hey  well I don't know  but I mean  they apparently were friends  I made some little  reference to some of the  locals or  some of the locals  what did you say  nothing  I don't even know  but that's what I'm saying  I don't know  I haven't faced my accusers  you didn't come out  eating a ham  singing dreidel  dreidel dreidel  or anything  you don't know  what you did  but they said  you can't go over there  anymore  and you want to go back 
[01:31:00]  right  yeah I tried to go back  but they banned me  well did the soldiers  enjoy it  I'm sure when I was there  with you  of course  I loved it  well I'm going back  so I'd love to have you  on the thing  we should make that happen  it can happen  Dave  you sure  how do you know you're banned  it's an act of treason  yeah but can't we  ramble it up  can't you look different  or something  I may be able to perform  for Al Qaeda  yeah you should just  switch sides  but I can't perform  for America  you should switch sides  can't you go as a contractor  and just  hey anybody got a couple 
[01:31:30]  oh hey you son  I know  yeah Blackwater would hire me  yeah  we can get you as a food server  but it is so amazing  you know like  oh god  I went back  I went with Colin  Bobby's actually going today  with Dane Cook  and I want to go back  Dave's going July 5th  through 10th  I kind of want to go man  I mean I'll go with you  but not in the summer  why not  too hot  yeah but that's the best part  my birthday's in July  that'd be great  my birthday's in July  how many shows you do a day  because we were doing  like one a day  we had a pretty easy  travel schedule  no helicopters 
[01:32:00]  we flew  it wasn't bad  yeah  I'm going to try and go  from Afghanistan  to Iraq  and I think there's only  two flights a day  with a layover  in Detroit  Dearborn  yeah Toledo  there's a holding pad  they take off  and they shoot you down  over the city  that you need to be in  yeah I don't know  how it's going to even work  but like in my mind  I'm thinking like comedy  you know it's like  hey pick up a one nighter  over here  but I think it's like  another 20 hours  from Afghanistan  to Iraq  well I'm going  would I be going to Afghanistan 
[01:32:30]  or just Iraq  no just Iraq  oh good  you can go with me man  that would be good  I don't screw around  I think you should come  with us Colin  I think that would be good  have fun guys  they'll sneak in  will you speak to  it could be like  to who  Senator Bird  let's say hi to Eric  in Colorado  Eric  hey morning boys  hi Eric  hey Jimmy  you're kind of  oversimplifying  what that sniper did  oh alright  way to humiliate me  well sorry  but the actual story 
[01:33:00]  on it was  it was a squad  they had gone  to the shooting range  for target practice  they took a copy  of the Quran  yes  they had scrawled  graffiti  and scrawled  whatever  they put graffiti  inside the Quran  anti-Muslim  ravings  and what not  and then they  used it for  target practice  it was a  cop  an Iraqi cop  who found it  took it to his  superiors  who went to  tribal leaders  the soldier  initially denied 
[01:33:30]  knowing anything  about it  he lied to  all the way up  his chain of command  and then when he  was finally confronted  that's why they're  facing disciplinary  action for it  for numerous  violations  of the uniform  code of military  that's what I said  you did  you're right  I did sir  but the bottom  line is  when a US soldier  is captured  they show his  ID on TV  and they remove  his head  I agree with  what you're saying  but what these  soldiers did 
[01:34:00]  was way out  of line too  alright it was  inappropriate  but it is a war zone  but don't you  I mean they play  it up  it's in all  the manuals  that they  deliberately  just figured  like they do  that to their  own Korans  in Guantanamo Bay  like that's known  that that's what  they do  they're not that  they act like  the Koran is so  cherished  but meanwhile  they attack  each other  in mosques  and hide  in mosques  so it's a little  bit disingenuous  when they start  crying about that  all the time  I'm thinking  that Dave's  got something  for the new  gong show  I think this 
[01:34:30]  could be a good  one  but because  it's TV  we're going  to use paintballs  well you said  you want edgy  I think this  is as edgy  as you can get  and then  of course  the beheading  I like that  but you know  it's so weird  like you guys  have been over  there like  you go to  Kuwait first  which is kind  of the Switzerland  of the Middle East  you know  they're like  we don't want  you here  never leave  you know  get out American  you want to  buy a car  you know  that kind of  thing  but they tell  you like  all the things  the Iraqi  army did  when they  rolled through  in 90  you know  it's like  first thing  they did  is they hung 
[01:35:00]  our whole  navy  from meat hooks  even though  it's like  12 guys  it's still  pretty weird  then they raped  and pillaged  their way down  Kuwaiti  Boulevard  and it was  kind of  basically  like a source  awards  there  but it was  crazy  I was actually  nervous in Kuwait  when we went in  because you didn't  you had a couple  of armed guys  that met us  at the airport  but in Iraq  you had full  military protection  I mean  I didn't feel  as protected  in Kuwait  it's like  these are  the regular  streets  it's like  we only have  two guys  that actually  made me more  nervous than Iraq  did  but you guys  were there  Colin and Jim  went there  like right after 
[01:35:30]  Saddam got caught  yeah like  when we won  you were there  when we were winning  really really  sorry  like what was that  like six months  after or something  like that  something like that  yeah  before the beheading  started  they hadn't  I was on  Cali started  and had to  lop enough heads  that's why  I didn't go back  I was too nervous  about a helicopter  going down somewhere  right  and you having to  you know  oh please  they would  please a woman  all over  yeah  you know how fast  I'd sell out  the military  if I was on  the hostage video  it's a bit  I'm working on  would you say  would you give  your website  if you were on 
[01:36:00]  the uh  do you want  more information  about what I'm  going through  go to  jimnorton.com  slash  yeah myspace  whatever  jimnorton.com  it's not even mine  well eat a bullet  would have been  I was there  in the summer  website address  already there  Jimmy  it goes up  to like 120  so you're  you're kind of  right not to go  but it really  but it's dry heat  right  it's a dry  so you'll be  right  you should do  the dry heat  with David Tell  you should go  the dry heat  Jeff Ross almost  had to go be  hospitalized  I mean not that  he's like  when you look  at like physical  health  like if a guy  like that  yeah  Tim Sylvia  that marathon  nothing 
[01:36:30]  go ahead  who's Tim Sylvia  mixed martial artists  oh  in other news  morning  that's that  back  oh well  maybe not  because Colin  decided  I picked a good  one that time  you have  I pity the boy  fool  don't eat my  cereal  thanks for wrecking  the flow of the show  Colin  we really appreciate it  in other news  anytime guys  hey my nuts  it's gonna scratch  them real quick  what is that 
[01:37:00]  well it needs  an explanation  but  I guess this guy  was pulled over  for DUI  and I believe  he was in  handcuffs  and you know  the cops there  and he needs  a little help  listen again  and or breath  hey my nuts  it's gonna scratch  them real quick  damn  they itch  before the law  you are required  to take a chemical  or physical breath test  to determine the  alcoholic content  of your blood  and or urine test  to detect the presence 
[01:37:30]  of a chemical  or controlled  they itch  do you understand  if you refuse  to take the chemical  or physical breath test  or the urine test  your driving privileges  will be suspended  for one year  for a first refusal  they itch  in 18 months  if you have  previously refused  these tests  additionally  your refusal  is admitted  into evidence 
[01:38:00]  wow this guy's  flustered by  this guy's package  it looks like  it's like the old  Cal Burnett show  as soon as they  would start laughing  yeah  right  into evidence  against you  in any criminal  or administrative  proceeding  do you understand  this ain't funny  okay I'm gonna  interpret this  as a refusal  oh yeah  no  I'm not  are you  no that's assault  yeah yeah  I'm not  are you  are you willing  to submit the testing  do you want to  take the breath  test mister 
[01:38:30]  no  okay  sir  you want to  forego the other  yes I do  will you stretch  my nuts  no no  due to your  combating nations  we're not going  to do the  oh stretch my nuts  no we're not  going to do that  or the physical  performance  can I stretch  my nuts  Dave I think  we got another  act for the  gong show  yes he's a  closer  was that like  an outtake  from no country  for old men  I heard 
[01:39:00]  Javier Bardem  is a very sexy  threesome with  Scarlett Johansson  and Penelope Cruz  in Woody Allen's  new picture  really  sounds steamy  wow you're doing  a little  gossip  yeah  that's the gossip  section of the  opium anthony  I heard  maid of honor  really steams up  the screens  with Patrick Dempsey  comedy  yeah  we're looking  he's our best  friend but then  he's also the  maid of honor  we're looking  forward to  Sex and the City  too  oh heavens  when is that  coming  oh honey  he's a keeper  oh boy  I think it's  next weekend 
[01:39:30]  huh guys  next weekend  can I tell you  I never saw  an episode of  Sex and the City  it was on last  night I was  watching  riveted  it was  not that they're  bad actors  it was just  it didn't make  me even smile  it's not  believable  first of all  they're all  playing poker  yeah  and uh  it was just  terrible  I don't get  the attraction  to that show  on any level  it's not for us  and I also saw  it's for chicks  yeah  it's for your  your broad  fine  but I mean  I didn't enjoy  it at all  nor did I enjoy  by the way  the American  Office  although Patrice  was very funny 
[01:40:00]  I saw a version  of that  where they had  to go down  there was a  strike  they all went  on strike  and I wanted  to put my  fist to the  television  that it's  compared to  the British  Office  oh the British  Office  is amazing  but Patrice  was actually  very funny  I'm sure  he wasn't  very funny  he was  just being  his friend  no I'm not  no he was  good  he was good  believe me  I detest  he's a good  actor Patrice  I wouldn't  go that far  he had to  play a big  dick  but it's  great  they wrote  him out  of the show  too  why  I don't  know  ask Patrice  probably too  difficult to  deal with  on the set  that's probably  what it was  why  they're all 
[01:40:30]  trying to be  nice  wanting to  love him  because he's  like the  big black  dude  and he  won't even  give them  that  he'll just  turn on  anybody  black  white  and that's  like the  whitest  show  oh yeah  let's say  hi to  Kaz  he's in  the military  Kaz what's  up  what's  going on  guys  oh really  fast  Eric asked  from Fishkill  because we're  talking about  the gong show  David Tell's  the new host  can David Tell  use Patrice  as Gene  Gene  Patrice will  not move  for anything  oh my god  good line 
[01:41:00]  I just wanted  as a military  guy for 17  years I wanted  to thank  Jimmy and  Conor and all  those guys  that take  their time  to come out  here and see  that's out  there in Iraq  and Afghanistan  man it is  greatly appreciated  and we appreciate  all the time  and effort  though you guys  don't make  any money  doing it  so we  appreciate it  as much  as you guys  I hope  love coming  out there  to do it  for us  well I just  do it to get  an inside track  on the imperialism  of America's  military  right  Jimmy  tell them  I was going  to ask you  what you guys  get out of this 
[01:41:30]  no we just  get to go  nothing  you just hang  with the soldiers  just a good  feeling  a warm feeling  you know  I love the  when you go  in and you get  that really  big breakfast  in the morning  in the military  like 6am  give me some  waffle cakes  and some pancakes  and then you just  sit around all day  you know  but that's what I like  if you do Iraq  two times  then they send you  to Korea  which is good  that's kind of  like the R&R  zone  where you get  to go and have  you know  the bang bang  girls  and all that  kind of stuff  so  I wouldn't mind  doing one  of the bases  I've never done  any of the bases 
[01:42:00]  either  because I want  just to do  the war zone  Korea they have  in Germany  they send comics  there  yeah we did  Germany  but that seems  like a kind of  fun excuse  to go to Germany  oh you can  travel the world  yeah see everything  but without the danger  but maybe you're not  realizing Jim's history  he said it's just  to go to Germany  exactly  little dungeon master  yeah I want to hear it  in the native tongue  what's the news  on that Austrian  dungeon thing  anything going on there  oh that naughty father  he's upset 
[01:42:30]  that the media  is calling him  an animal  yeah  so  and what's the penalty  in  15 years maximum  I think  is all he can get  15 spankings  that's really it  that's the maximum  jail sentence  you can get  in Austria  they really are  very liberal  I guess after  World War 2  and everybody  was coming home  they're like  we'll give you  15 years max  that's perfect  in other news  this is a story  about California's  budget crisis  so what does  pornography have  to do with the state's  budget  California is more  than 17 billion dollars  in the red 
[01:43:00]  a budget deficit  growing by the minute  we need additional  revenues  and we've got to  get creative  California is scrambling  for creative ways  to keep the state afloat  which brings us  to pornography  in this country  the adult entertainment  revenues  are greater than  the combined revenues  of ABC  CBS  and NBC  and the headquarters  for that industry  in this country  is California  Democratic State Assemblyman  Charles Calderon  introduced legislation  to slap a whopping  25% tax 
[01:43:30]  on the sales  of adult material  which he says  could generate  700 million dollars  in revenue  the adult industry  is screaming foul  make no mistake  our industry  will leave the state  from time of production  to the time  a DVD reaches the consumer  it could be taxed  five times  at 25%  that's absolutely ridiculous  Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger  says California  can get 15 billion dollars  by borrowing  against future lottery profits  his proposal 
[01:44:00]  will go before voters  in November  the problem is  California is in danger  of running out of money  way before then  wow  California sucks  yeah  they got problems there  I don't know  so they're going to tax  the porn industry  yeah  like cigarettes  yeah exactly  that's what the idea is  I don't know  what to say about that  I mean  I honestly wasn't  paying attention  I was reading about R. Kelly  oh the R. Kelly story  is amazing  look at the tax  R. Kelly now  well they're showing  they're showing the video 
[01:44:30]  during the opening  what  opening  statements or whatever  and  the start of the videotape  if anyone  I've seen it  but years ago  the man hands the female money  and she mouths the words  thank you  she's blank faced  and impassive  and he speaks to her  in a hushed  monotone voice  slow it down  and she calls him  daddy  wow  thank you  but she said it sarcastically  thank you  no no one wasn't doing that  he was writing down  this new joke for Zach  how about this thing  in porn in California 
[01:45:00]  I want to masturbate  what's that mean in Zach  he's the guy  that used to do the  how many people watch porn  oh I guess  I spend a billion dollars a year  that was his icebreaker  you're absolutely right  there was a point in my career  when I did do that  oh great  it's all me guys  you gotta keep it fun  you wave at them  like it's you know  come on guys  we all know  I like the thread  of the porn industry  we will leave the state  so watch out  that caravan's on the move  like a gym 
[01:45:30]  I went somewhere out  goodbye Van Nuys  yeah all those  what else you got  on the R. Kelly thing there  Jimmy  well there's a little bit more  there's a whole big article  on it  but it says  prosecutors say  the man in the video  is Kelly  and that the female  who was as young  as 13  when the tape  was made  between January of 98  or November of 2000  I don't know how  they figure out  when the tape was made  they can't figure out  who's on the tape  but they know  when it was made  the hair you said  no I was singing  R. Kelly  oh  he would be a great judge 
[01:46:00]  for the gong show  R. Kelly  yeah the kids  the matinee  the matinee version  yeah  let's say  hi to Matt  on Long Island  Matt  yeah  what's up Matt  hey how you doing  pretty good  good  who am I talking to  Opie and Colin  and Jimmy  and David  hey what's going on  I'm just calling  to wish Kenny's son  best of luck  in Iraq  we'll pray for him  while he's here man  yeah I think Kenny's son  leaves today right  yeah from  he's in Kuwait  where's Kenny  he's going to Kuwait  for two weeks  I think he's leaving 
[01:46:30]  Seattle to go to Kuwait  for two weeks  yeah  Kenny's son is going  over there  he's starting today  he starts his travel  over there  and he'll be in Kuwait  for two weeks  I think they kind of  break you in  and then you go into Iraq  break you in  that's how non-military  they acclimate you  yeah  to the climate  you trail for a week  like a restaurant  here's Kenny  Kenny  so Jeffrey's going  he goes away  leaves Seattle today  to go to Kuwait  yes he's  currently  Fort Lewis  McCord Air Force Base 
[01:47:00]  which is just  south of Tacoma  Washington  and he's going  to Kuwait  for two weeks  in process  to Iraq  through Kuwait  wow  okay  and  I don't know  if it's confidential  where he's going  yeah don't say  where he's going  are you alright  how you feeling today  I'm very proud  of my son  you're right  you're going to  make me get all  choked up  you know  I'm concerned  but you know  it's a very honorable  thing that he's doing  absolutely  and for those of you 
[01:47:30]  who don't know  you can't send  any porn  or any of that stuff  to the guys  in the military  only candy and stuff  they're all weird  about what they  they don't allow  any of that  kind of stuff  to go over there  so  yeah  I'm just finding out  like all that  information now  you know  about it  you know  all that stuff  and you know  if anybody's going  on a USO show  I'd love to go  and you know  hopefully we can  work it out  to go where my son is  and you know  I could get to see him  wouldn't that be wild  if you come with us  and you catch him  masturbating  like  almost way 
[01:48:00]  are you getting him  a satellite phone  or any of that stuff  he's checking  into everything  emails  I think  a lot of emails  yeah the government  gives you like  two free phone calls  a week  boy thanks  yeah  thanks a lot  you know  I don't  you know  all I know  is like  you know  it's going to be like  average of 140 degrees  there  yes  in the summer  and you know  he's going to be  living in a tent  with like  you know  no luxuries 
[01:48:30]  they probably  don't want you  to have too many  phone calls either  because they don't  want you being  too connected  to home  otherwise it's  too depressing  no they have  you two emails  two phone calls  how many minutes  though  well the good thing  is  you won't have to  worry for any  renegade talent  coming over  like a Colin Quinn  since he's been banned  it'll be all  dog acts  you know  Miss Universe  from the 80s  yeah  hey look at his shirt  you remember her  on sister sister  ladies  you know  that would sound  like the weirdest  you know  yeah  I think it's so funny 
[01:49:00]  that they think  our troops  are like  Bob Kelly  is going over  they're really  happy he's going  but they just find  you to be  inappropriate  it's unbelievable  we're all going  except you  how does that  I know  I know  Colin's been banned  Kenny if you didn't  hear  he's not allowed  to go  I really am  getting the hint  he doesn't really  know why  it was a  Biloxi Blues  incident  I think we should  start a petition  we're sending you  to Mirama  wherever that was  Burma  we're sending  start a petition  to unban  Colin  a what  yes  I love to stutter  I know  well Kenny 
[01:49:30]  that's amazing  that's amazing  it must be even  weirder for you  to have such a  patriotic  noble son  and to be  working for a  gutless draft  doctor like this  bastard  this yellow coat  you spineless  jellyfish  I must  it different  with you  Mr. Norton  is very patriotic  that is true  thank you  in kind of a  selfish way though  no no no  he loves America  because of what  it provides him  if he's yourself  we would have won  two years ago  I love America  simply because of 
[01:50:00]  what they say  you can do in  California and  Massachusetts  yeah  with the gay  marriage or the  porno taxing  I meant the  gay marriage  but hold on  Jim is always  saying America  love it or leave  it  you bet I do  you don't believe  me read the  bumper sticker on  my car  better dead than  red I've said  that many times  alone  all right Kenny  well we're all  thinking about  Jeffrey obviously  thank you  thank you  I really appreciate  message boards  too have been 
[01:50:30]  giving me a lot  of well wishes  and thoughts  and prayers  for my son  it's all very  appreciated  how was the  trip to Seattle  I know Kenny  and his wife  and his youngest  son went over  to see Jeff  in Seattle  it was a good  trip  it was  yes it was  a beautiful  six hour ride  thank God  we had an  emergency row  so I had the  leg room  it's a lot of  pressure though  yeah  did he cry  no there was  no crying  during  you kept  yourself together  yes this  departure  because your  wife has been  known to call  you a baby  yeah  really  yeah 
[01:51:00]  oh she's the  one who doesn't  cry you do  yeah  she kind of  rolls her eyes  as Kenny  when I first  dropped him off  at the recruiting  office when he  was leaving for  boot camp  like the last  vision my son  had of his  father was being  a blubbering  idiot  the other  moment  because I  talked to your  wife I don't  know  you went to  see him as he  was graduating  from boot camp  right  and you almost  got him thrown  right back into  the beginning of  boot camp  because you  were cheering  too loud  and stuff  yeah 
[01:51:30]  what's that  story again  yeah and I  tell you  explain that  story because  I'm not  how could you  get him  did you open  a dress or  something  no no  I was just  you know  I got caught  up in the  moment  you know  I was never  fortunate enough  to have the  military experience  you know  and we went  down there  and it's like  really impressive  like you know  I never seen  you know  a military base  before and  you know  they're all  squared away  in their  uniforms  and you know  they look good  and they look  tough and they're  marching around 
[01:52:00]  and you know  they got that  military bearing  and presence  and you know  and you know  they have the  whole big  ceremony on  I guess they  call it the  dress parade  field or  something and  you know  and they  announced the  whole boot camp  graduation and  all the proud  parents were there  and no one was  prouder than me  and you know  I was just asked  to tone it down  a little  yeah because  if he acknowledged  that his father  was cheering for him  what would have  happened  he would have  had to start  over or something  like that  there's like  rules 
[01:52:30]  there's PDAs  public displays  of affection  there's all  kind of rules  about that  you know  so like  you can't like  hug the kid  for more than  two seconds  you know  you can't  you gotta behave  yourself  and you know  and me  and my younger  son are  just creeps  you know  you drop something  we're goofing  on everybody  and my military  son is like  you know  he's all of a sudden  the disciplinarian  telling us to like  behave ourselves  see but if that was  the French army  you could have went up  and tongue kissed him 
[01:53:00]  and a ball  and who's the creep  that they put on  hug duty  like he's got the timer  like if you have to  hug more than two seconds  he actually goes over  and asks you to stop it  yeah  yeah  yeah  it's a whole  different lifestyle  that military thing  yeah  and he's a cop  he's a  he's a  yes  yes  they called  security forces  in the air force  and he's a cop  in the air force  yeah  so I'm very proud  of him  he's kind of like  following in my  footsteps  and you know  godspeed to him  he'll do  alright man 
[01:53:30]  yes  alright  thanks Kenny  but thank you everybody  we got David Tell  in the studio  we're going to finish up  this side of the show  next  let's not forget  the new host  of the Garg Show  and also  Stress Factory  I know  but a little  little info  and David Tell  at the Stress Factory  next weekend  in New Brunswick  New Jersey  and a little later on  in the studio  we have  I don't know how to say  his name  Uwe or Uwe Boll  the German director  who beat up  the critics  his four of his critics  he fought them  in a boxing match  the guy's an animal  in that movie  The Heckler  yeah  that we saw  that was pretty good 
[01:54:00]  yeah  what about Anthony  well that's what I was  leading to there  Colin  when we get back  Anthony's phone call  from this morning  calling in sick  can't believe you guys  called in once today  where his voice  was a little  a little swishy  yeah  oh boy  are we going to  make fun of that  when he gets back here  not just that  but also  him and the girl  thinking that's  like a clever joke  uh uh  and they're like  I'm sick  yeah  and she goes  throw up  throw up  we'll pick apart  the phone call next  alright  alright  it's Opie and Anthony  stay there  this is Jill Nicolini  I just want to say  Anthony Cumia  I love you 
[01:54:30]  hey it's Jill Nicolini  and you're listening  to Opie  and my big daddy  Anthony  Colin just keeps  on babbling  oh Colin doesn't care  the mic goes on  but he's in mid-set  I know  it's amazing  it's the Opie and Anthony  show  sorry fellas I don't know  all the rules of radio  why don't you give me  a signal  idiots  and uh  you're right  he puts it back  on us accurately  that was hurtful  and uh  David Tell is left  oh  please  oh my god  this is the weirdest  radio show ever  we all knew Anthony 
[01:55:00]  was never going to  make it in today  I'm like  alright cool  we'll uh  we'll get Colin  David Tell is coming in  I'm all excited  to you know  make it happen  I wake up with  just one little sneeze  in the morning  and now it's like  a full blown  I can't see out of  my left eye  allergy attack  I hope he's having  an allergy attack  and I  and I'm having  the worst farts  allergy farts  then I went into  the bathroom  and you don't even  know what  want to know  what happened  in there  I'm just losing it  what were you  going to say Jimmy  I don't remember 
[01:55:30]  okay  that's fine  oh Dave left  yeah David Tell  is off to do  more press  for the gong show  I think he's  going to be  a great host  I think it's  going to be  very interesting  as long as  they allow him  to be edgy  and dry  and sarcastic  that show  will be a hit  for Comedy Central  yeah  and with those  kind of freaky  people  he can really  make it into  something  and we already  suggested Sandy Kane  and a few of our  regulars to appear  on the gong show  and he goes  you guys would  appear on the gong show  right  as like the gongers  or whatever  I'm like  absolutely  yeah  alright we'll start 
[01:56:00]  with this  this might lead  to something  we're hoping  keep your fingers  crossed  we might get  Anthony on the  phone before  we leave this  side of the show  we're going to  start with  Anthony calling  in sick  everyone must  know what's  going on  Jill has a  crush on  Anthony  I think  Anthony's a  bit smitten  they decided  to go out  last night  and we all  knew Anthony  you know  he doesn't  have any type  of restraint  in his body  so we knew  that today  would be the  day we do  a show  without Anthony  Jill  Nicolini  of course 
[01:56:30]  the traffic  vixen  from channel  11  here in  New York  City  and this  is the  phone call  we got  text messages  all night  long  and at  430 in the  morning  Anthony  left this  message for  Steve  hi Steve  I'm really  sick  I'm not  going to be  able to  make it  in  I'm creeped  out by how  he's talking  Colin brought  it up earlier  I don't think  you're going to  make it in  Pacino sounded  more masculine  giving his last  will and testament  in dog day  afternoon 
[01:57:00]  how  nothing  I can't  believe that  got nothing  I'm so happy  with that one  no  Colin  you didn't  sound that gay  in dog day  afternoon  Pacino  really  I love you  more than  any man  has ever  loved another  man  dear Leon  that was  a bad  impression  but it  wasn't  feminine  the way  he said  it  of course  it was  the words  might have  been feminine  well whatever  it was  you know  what I  meant  how good  is Jill  Nicolini  that  she  effed  the man  right out  of him  not only  that but  how about  Nicolini 
[01:57:30]  Carding  of  Massapequa  Park  her father  and her  brother  called in  they're  like  these  two  Italian  dudes  me  I'm  going to  beat  Anthony  Hi Steve  I'm  really  sick  I'm  not  going to  be able  to make  it  in  sounds  like  Leonard  won  today  I  don't  know  if  Hope  wants  to do  the  show  with  Jimmy  but  I'm  really 
[01:58:00]  ill  I  don't  think  I'm  going  to  make  it  in  yeah  give  me  a call  if  you  have  any  questions  but  I  don't  know  if  they  want  to  do  the  show  that's  okay  we  know  that  stupid  permission  from you  yeah  where's  the other  part  where it  looks  like  she  feeds  him  I  don't  think  she  feeds  him  I  caught  what  happened  watch  let  me  go  back  no  let  it  play  through  it  um 
[01:58:30]  yeah  I'm  really  sick  I  think  I  got  like  a  24  hour  bug  what  yeah  I'm  throwing  up  I'm  throwing  up  and  stuff  right  there  what  she  said  to  Anthony  was  you  make  me  want  to  throw  up  and  he  misunderstood  what  he  heard  was  yeah  I'm  throwing  up  he  thought  it  was  part  of  the  cute  game  I'm  throwing  up  and  stuff  that's  good  uh  so  I  don't  think  I'm  gonna  make  it  in  uh  bye 
[01:59:00]  a lot  of  people  on  pal  talk  they're  screaming  bit  bit  bit  Anthony  knew  he  had  at  least  like  uh  you  know  call  Steve  and let  everyone  know  that he's  not  coming  in  because  he's  obviously  still  partying  so he's  he's  playing  the sick  thing  you know  in a  very  awful  way  yeah  awfully  yeah  all right  so then  uh  then we  took  uh  Anthony's  phone  call  we've been  doing these  like TMZ  type promos  are you 
[01:59:30]  trying to get  Anthony  what happened  oh he went  back to sleep  what are you  talking about  the least he  can do is  call the  effing radio  show  what a  creep  I'm gonna have  to go to the  emergency room  in like  15 minutes  here  to get  one of those  shots to make  sure I don't  die  I had him  I had him  he sounded  very tired  very crackly  I said  just stay  conscious  for 10  minutes  so we can  get you  on the  phone  he said  all right  were we  in commercial  when he  got him  yeah 
[02:00:00]  okay  and he  said okay  and I  called him  I just  started calling  him back  Travis was  calling him  and that's  going right  to voicemail  and I'm  just nonstop  redialing both  their numbers  just keep  doing that  are they  back to  sleep  boy  Jill said  hey  what are  you doing  I thought  I'd call  in  are they  are they  it's all right  honey  are they  together  so they  actually went  their separate  ways got  up and  met for  breakfast  we took  Anthony's  sick call  did this  and now  for an 
[02:00:30]  update  on  anthelini  gate  08  the two  apparently  went on  a hot  long island  date last  night  it was  so steamy  it kept  them away  from work  this morning  hi  Steve  I'm  really  sick  I'm  not going  to be  able to  make it  in  what  yeah  I'm  throwing  up  I'm  throwing  up  I think  I got  like a  24 hour  bug  after Anthony  left a series  of text messages  for his  co-workers  we can only  speculate on 
[02:01:00]  exactly what  went on  last night  but what  we can  say is  that there  was a  whole lot  of blanking  going on  dude  this is  some  serious  blank  I'm  uh  I'm  going  blank  to  blank  blank  we'll  keep you  updated  as the  Anthelini  saga  continues  and  Anthony  went back  to sleep  he turned  his phone  off  how do  you turn  your phone  off  when it  dumps right  into voicemail  that means  his phone's  off  right  or maybe 
[02:01:30]  he fell  asleep  on the  line  no  okay  she told  him turn  your phone  off and  stop the  nonsense  and he  did what  he was  told  of course  of course  this is  turning into  a real  thing  now  this  could be  the last  day  of the  Anthelini  thing  we're all  going to  get the  calls later  dudes  you know  no it's  the first  day  yeah  the first  day  of that  is the  last  day  of the  Obi  Anthony  thing  it's  like  Yoko  she's  broken  up  the  band  we're  already  prepared  for that  at the  end  of the  month  and now  we have  a new 
[02:02:00]  update  more  news  is coming  from the  Anthelini  camp  Anthony  had better  watch  out  get the  fungo  back  and get  over  there  worse  yet  rumors  have been  circulating  that an  ex of  Nicolini's  may have  gotten his  third leg  glued to  his second  uh oh  what did  Anthony get  himself  I love  her even  more now 
[02:02:30]  I know  Anthony  Jill  and Jill's  father  Mr. Nick  have all  been closed  mouth about  the situation  but we  know what's  really going  on  we did  tell Anthony  he has  to come  in  with  her  panty  stay  tuned  as the  juiciest  Anthelini  details are  surely  still to  come  it would  have been  nice to end  the show  with a  phone call  from  Anthony  I thought  he could  hold on  for five  minutes  we got  him  actually on  the phone  during the  commercial  break  we said  hang in 
[02:03:00]  there  how hung  over is he  that he  couldn't hang  in there  for five  minutes  a cynical  person would  say that  he knew  you were  on a  commercial  and he  called  up  so he  called  in  you can't  say he  didn't  call  in  so he's  a phony  fake  team  player  let me  try him  right now  he's going to  after your  phone  he will  he always  does  he knows  this is going to be great  when he doesn't  i know  i you know  we have to have  the big ending  i mean i might  have to read  the text message  what are you  like a

[02:06:00]  their backs like  metallica uh black  sabbath red hot  chili peppers  the rock is back  in new york at uh  k-rock and denville  new jersey got a  couple of complaints  because there's one  board right over the  highway so the mayor  requested we take  them down  right and have you  been to denville  they have a lot  they have nothing  to complain about  this oh really  abuse they've thrown  over the years  the billboards to  your right that  we'll put it up on  onaradio.com for the  rest of the country  look at the billboard  jimmy it's really  they actually uh  airbrushed the side  boob out of these  women i find it 
[02:06:30]  offensive like they're  they're naked this  one has zeppelin  guns and roses green  day the rock of new  york is back  anthony  huh i'm sorry man  steve what you  got an update  um jill just woke  up and sent me a  good morning text  message  uh says uh good  morning just awoke  how are you and i've  been trying to get on  the phone ever since  and now her phone's  dumping back into  voicemail so right  back and say call in  i did okay i did  jim well if we could  get like one of their  voices on before we uh  i'm trying get out of  here it would make for 
[02:07:00]  a nice show nice show  ending instead of  talking about a a a a  controversial billboard  for the station here in  new york denville those  hillbillies  yeah fireside i actually  did well there when i did  that's funny story  uh it's really a  notoriously tough gig  for comedians but i  had a better success  rate than most  well you were from  the area maybe  yeah you know it was  a little local stuff  a couple of garden  state parkway 78 jokes  oh god well i open up  with i always find a  crappy town and i kind  of just dump on that  for the what do you do  when you're in denville 
[02:07:30]  how do you find a  crappy you make that  the crappy town you go  denville gateway to you  know you had even worse  town  here's the news stories  about the billboard  these barebacks have  certainly drawn attention  but maybe not the kind  the advertiser wanted  when i saw it i actually  took a double look and i  was like wow this is a  little bit offensive i'm  not gonna lie to you  the promotion featuring  the topless trio was  launched they obviously  talked to a fat chick  no because they they  don't understand like  they don't watch boxing  where guys put those on  their back they think it's  like as if they're  depersonalizing them as 
[02:08:00]  humans  now the topless trio was  launched eight weeks ago  to announce that k-rock was  back but it may have  backfired  i don't see the necessity  of it you know i think  there could be another way  to get your point across  how did this backfire  they got the news talking  about the fact that the  radio station is back  playing rock  why did they played right  into the radio station's  hand  of course  dummies this is exactly  what they were looking for  up there in the corporate  offices  did you guys take it down  no well they're scheduled  to come down  thursday anyway 
[02:08:30]  yeah so  timing mayor  this is this is perfect  timing  you got the news  talking about this  more uh more marketing  and advertising for the  radio station  the ad campaign's goal  was to attract male  listeners 18 to 49  putting the names of  popular rock groups on  the bare backs  but the men we found  aren't so fond of nudity  in public views  i don't think my children  need to see that they're  four two in a year  and you know some people  i guess would say they're  too young to get it  i don't want them exposed  to that this young  oh shut up  shut your mouth  shut your trap 
[02:09:00]  it's a bunch of girls  backs  well backs are pretty  titillating  this day and age  i guess so huh  go ahead  the mayor of denville  received several complaints  from motorists  driving along route 10  one woman says the  billboard is  insensitive exploitation  it's back nudity  it's it's not the worst  thing that could be up  there but we do agree  with this last caller  who called in that  we would rather not see  that type of billboard  so the reality is  these bareback campaigns 
[02:09:30]  have actually reached  the end of their run  and in just a couple of  days these billboards  will be stripped away  so non-story but  helping out the radio  station thank you to the  news the fact the mayor  of that dump said it's  back nudity that's what  in a masculated fruity  country we are back  nudity is a problem  because somebody's stupid  offspring might see it  americans make me sick  they played right into our  hands make me sick  ah it's you expect the news  to be well it does 
[02:10:00]  americans act like the  rest of the world is all  enlightened they're a bunch  of morons too i don't care  about the rest of the world  i don't i do and i don't  live i care about doesn't  claim to be this free speech  oasis i care about uh  yeah babies we've turned  into the rest of the world  you expect to be awful  speaking of oasis are they  gonna be playing a lot of  oasis on gay rock i don't  know but it's on one of the  girls backs  why did they put them  low like the tramp stamp  why do they have to put  them up there it's a  hack move anyway yeah  no they have to block the  heinie it would have been  great if i no my artistic  direction would have made  it logical and then it 
[02:10:30]  wouldn't have been  exploited no wouldn't  have they would have said  we're reflecting shut up  they would have said we're  reflecting what people do  with their tattoos yeah  that's what you want to  get to the k-rock listeners  we're reflecting oh i'm  sorry i didn't know we're  playing i forgot that  again you know you worship  gallagher the theater act so  i'm sorry if i'm playing  to a higher goal in life  well the bottom line is  no you're right let's  play to whatever the  common denominator people  this is fascinating but i  think we might have an  update steve what do you  got a nothing nothing  goodbye  um text message from jill to

[02:13:30]  well  well  means  wednesday  here we are opie and jimmy  at XM Satellite Radio.  Wow.  I'm losing it. 
[02:14:00]  I knew Anthony wasn't going to make it in today  because of the big date with Jill Nicolini.  So we were well prepared  and we were going to have a really good show  and I think we did have a really good show.  This is the mistake I made.  I'm in full allergy outbreak here.  I've sneezed probably 200 times.  My nose is raw.  My eye, I can't even see out of it anymore.  And I just figured out what I did.  I'm a very allergic boy.  And I'm allergic to dust.  So yesterday, you see this shirt?  This is the same shirt I had on yesterday. 
[02:14:30]  I was lazy today so I picked a shirt up  off the floor of my apartment.  It was probably just in the dust.  Put it on and now this is what I get for doing that.  Well, if laying on the floor of your apartment,  if it's that bad,  you probably have too much dust in the apartment.  Well, I get it cleaned once a week  and today's cleaning day.  So, you know.  But it's just getting worse as the morning goes on here.  But we have a great guest  that we did not want to blow off.  I don't know much about Uwe.  Or Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe.  Uwe.  Yeah, Uwe. 
[02:15:00]  But I saw him in the movie Heckler,  Jamie Kennedy's movie  that we really, really liked.  And we had Jamie come in to promote the movie.  And there's a scene in the movie  where you beat the crap out of a bunch of critics.  And it's hilarious  because you got these cocky, you know,  guys that hide behind their, you know,  their computer, their keyboards and stuff.  And they're talking trash about, I don't know,  a certain project or?  No, all my movies.  Just all your movies in general.  They're just not fans of yours. 
[02:15:30]  And they're all cocky  saying what they really think of this,  you know, of you.  And then the next scene is  they're in the ring with you boxing.  They actually agree to box you.  How did you get them to agree to do that?  Because critics normally wouldn't agree to do that.  What was the spin you gave  to get them to agree to fight you  in a real boxing ring?  A free trip to Vancouver.  I said, look, if you want to do it  and come up to Vancouver,  I'll fly you up, actually.  But it will be a real boxing fight  because I hate you. 
[02:16:00]  And they still agreed to this.  Yeah, and they came up.  I think they wanted to get a little famous,  fame or whatever, out of it.  I don't know.  Just the voice alone,  if I was on the phone with you,  I would say,  ah, I don't need the trip to Vancouver.  Just the voice alone  would have scared me out of that scenario.  Well, they didn't understand  that he had real anger.  They're just these snot.  And legitimately,  now what is it that bothers you?  Was there any legitimate criticism?  Because we all get criticized legitimately. 
[02:16:30]  Absolutely, and this would be no problem.  The problem I had is  that they actually trashed me  whatever I did.  But it was only about me,  how bad I am,  and what a loser I am,  whatever.  And if you read that now,  you make three or four movies  and you get the same reviews  over and over again,  even if the movies  are completely different.  Yeah.  Then I was like really pissed.  Let's say it this way.  Why is your movie so controversial?  Because there's a lot of controversy.  You always stir up a lot of,  you kind of touch  a lot of taboo subjects. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah,  especially with Postal now,  my new movie,  what gets out Friday  in selected theaters.  So in New York,  you have to go to Cobble Hill  in Brooklyn to see it.  So it's not easy.  But no,  I think my movies  are kind of  ruthless,  violent  genre movies.  And because they're based  on video games  a lot of times,  you are directly listed as  like this cannot be  something with quality. 
[02:17:30]  Basically.  Okay,  so they're basically  going to attack it  on principle.  And you put out this thing  for the,  they said it was  your four or five  harshest critics,  the guys that you would  read what they said  and you just wanted  to strangle them.  And how good did it feel  to actually punch  these people in the face?  No,  really good.  I was like,  I trained,  I was prepared  because I had no clue  that four guys,  maybe they are good.  You never know  they're coming to Vancouver  and then they turn out  to be like 220 pounds 
[02:18:00]  each or whatever.  I had no idea.  And so I was really prepared  but they were not prepared.  And so my message was  after I knocked  the last guy out,  I said like,  look,  if I would prepare  my movies,  like you prepared  that boxing fights,  then they would suck  big time.  So there's a lot of stuff  out in the internet  and geeks  and whatever.  They don't really know  how much work it is  to do something professional,  whatever you do.  If you write a book  or you make a movie,  you have to put a lot  of time and effort 
[02:18:30]  into it  and they don't respect that.  They think they are  like kings  because they are  sitting at home  on mommy's kitchen table  still eating the sandwiches  she's doing  and then they go  on their computer  and they think  they can do everything  better.  And these guys are lazy  because they didn't even  Google your name  to find out  that you've done  a lot of boxing  in your life.  You just told me off air  that you boxed  until you were 29 years old  so you know  what you're doing  in the ring.  And these guys  still agree  to go in the ring  with you  and just amazing.  One guy was on all fours 
[02:19:00]  puking outside the ring.  He had a real rough time.  Who was that one?  In the ring.  This was Jeff Schneider.  Oh, he's a guy from...  He's Variety now  from Variety.  He was throwing up  and the worst  was Lotex  from somethingawful.com.  He was like  dressed in an American flag  and it was the fights  were in Vancouver  in Canada, right?  And then he was like  yelling to the audience  before like  you're hiding a terrorist here.  Uwe is a terrorist.  Give him back to America  and so on.  So he didn't have 
[02:19:30]  a lot of fans  like right away.  Right.  He was trying to be outrageous.  He was trying to be like  whoa, this guy  is a little crazy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And he got a fucking beating  didn't he?  Yeah.  Good for you.  He was the first guy  that got knocked down.  What was the relationship  with these guys after?  Have any of them contacted you?  Are they still bashing you online?  Have they toned down?  Two of the guys  Chance Minter  and Chris Alexander  actually turned into  something different.  I don't know  because of brain damage  or because they actually  talked with me 
[02:20:00]  and so they liked it more  and they start liking  my movies after the thing  and so it's kind of  for me a success already  because I turned 50% around  from the four.  Well, who's going to give you  a bad review now  after seeing the heckler stuff?  Wait a minute now.  The guy you actually fought  what's his name?  Chance Minter.  Wasn't he an amateur boxer?  This was the point.  He said like he boxed  also one and a half years  so I put him last.  He came  he was the last guy 
[02:20:30]  in the ring  but he couldn't  he couldn't do it.  He was not really good trained  let's say it this way.  So it was actually five.  I'm sorry.  I said four.  It was actually five.  No, no.  It was four.  Oh, we have five.  In total it was five critics  but one was in Spain  and I boxed him  in Malaga in Spain  two weeks before  the main event.  I was in a festival  in Spain  and they had a full  ring sizing  and there was a critic  from Madrid  who stepped in the ring  and I won 
[02:21:00]  with points  so I didn't knock him out  in Spain, the guy.  He survived.  Oh, he survived.  One guy lost a match  and he went on  and made several  who was this guy?  Kiyanka?  Yeah.  He went and made  allegations against you  saying that you refused  to fight against Chance Minter.  Now, why are they saying  he refused to fight against him?  No, no.  I fought against Chance Minter.  He was the last guy  on the evening.  Right.  So, no, they said  all kinds of  absurd stuff later  like Lotex said also  I promised not to hit him  and I said 
[02:21:30]  why I should get you up here  this was the whole point.  Right.  So, yeah.  Some people said  that you told these guys  that it was going to be  a fun boxing exhibition.  Thank you.  I can't talk.  And then they were surprised  that it was the real deal  when they got there.  This is completely absurd.  You know,  I've wrote to everybody before  like I want to hit you.  I want to damage you.  Come up to Vancouver  and then they agreed to it  and a lot of people  I forced to come out  didn't come out 
[02:22:00]  because they were scared.  So, and I think  these guys were full aware  what the situation was.  I don't get  who would agree to that.  Well, especially knowing  a guy who's fueled  by anger at them.  Yeah, sure.  It's like, you know,  if you're trashing a guy  especially a guy  with the mentality  he makes the movies you make  they're definitely  got a violence to them.  It's like, well,  this is a guy  that thinks a certain way.  Why would you want  to get in the ring  when you know  he hates your fucking guts?  I mean, I would just  stay home behind the keyboard  and keep talking shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I guess they were arrogant  in more than one way.  Exactly.  But I think also  because they all  want to self-promote. 
[02:22:30]  They wanted some exposure.  Exactly.  They were looking  for exposure.  So, now, what is it  you definitely don't  do mainstream films  at all.  What do you feel  about a lot  of the mainstream films?  Like, Indiana Jones  gets all this press.  It's well-received  at the festival  in Cannes.  I mean...  Yeah, Kung Fu Panda  also, you know.  It's kind of absurd.  Like, if a festival  in Cannes  shows Kung Fu Panda  because I think  the whole purpose  of a festival  gets like a little 
[02:23:00]  turned into an absurd thing.  But I think  the problem is  that we have  too many  Indiana Jones movies.  You know,  it's not Indiana Jones  but as an example.  And I think  the choices  for the audience  are not good anymore  in a way  because you have  50 tentpole movies  every year.  And then you get  from Speed Racer  to Iron Man  to Indiana Jones  to Narnia.  And I don't...  As a viewer  I want to see  basically not always  this kind of stuff. 
[02:23:30]  If I see one or two  comic book movies a year  it's enough.  And then I want to see  something else.  And I want to see  40 times  Marvel comic book heroes  every year.  You know what?  Movies have to go  the way of music.  You know?  I mean, back in the day  it was really tough  to get your music  out there to the masses.  You know, radio stations  would play only  a certain amount of bands  and a certain amount of songs.  There just wasn't any room.  And then the Napster thing  started really, you know,  exploding and getting exposure  for these bands  that deserved exposure. 
[02:24:00]  And now, you know,  it's...  Now a lot of bands  are being heard  that probably wouldn't  have been heard  whatever, 10 years ago.  And for some reason  movies are still behind  as far as that goes.  You know, it's really tough  to get into these theaters  with your project.  And they're trying to make it...  They're making sure  they make it hard  for you guys...  for us to get the movies,  you know, online  illegally and all that.  But I think they should  pay attention to what  Napster did to the music industry  and allow it to happen.  Start releasing them online. 
[02:24:30]  Would you release  certain films online  if you could?  Because you can get  them all over the world  that way fast.  Yeah, the problem is,  of course, accounting.  Right?  So, because you cannot  do it for free.  You have to get  some money back.  And there's a thing  and then you have,  of course, with music  it's easier to do  a fast download  in great quality.  Sure.  I'm tired always  if I stream a movie  on my laptop  that's that buffering  or whatever it takes forever  and then I think,  okay, I go to Blockbuster  and I rent it 
[02:25:00]  because it takes too long.  Yeah, the quality's  not as good.  Exactly.  The music industry  should just embrace it  and know that this is  going to happen eventually.  Let people start doing it.  The movie industry.  The movie industry.  Yeah, the movie industry  and then build  some kind of business plan  down the road  but they're crazy.  Yeah.  No, but I agree.  The future is on  that video on demand  streaming  and the theatrical business  is for independent filmmakers  it's just too expensive. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  It's like you can almost  you're not getting  any wide awareness anymore  without like  $30 million in TV spots.  Right, right, right.  And this is completely crazy  because how you want  to ever recoup your budget  if you have to spend  like double  as your budget  for advertising.  How many films  have you done?  I did 15 movies already.  And what would you say  was the biggest  commercial success  of all of them?  No, it was  Profit Wise,  House of the Dead.  And what was that?  It was like a zombie movie. 
[02:26:00]  And but like volume  it is  In the Name of the Kings movie  I just  it's out on the DVD stores  with Jason Statham.  It's like a big epic movie  Ray Liotta is in it  and was my most expensive movie  with a $60 million budget.  Like this was  and it sells of course  very good on DVD  but theatrical  I didn't have the full  power of a studio behind me  so you fail  even with a big movie  because you don't get that  like trailering 
[02:26:30]  in the theaters  for six months.  Like this is the whole point.  Like people are always surprised  like look Iron Man  how successful it is  but look  if you would  pick a  let's say  a different movie  and you would show trailers  in 20,000 theaters  for like six months  you would make  out to the box office  with another movie.  So it cost you  $60 million to make that movie.  What did it make  at the box office?  Do you know what?  In US only $5 million.  $5 million?  What was a disaster.  Worldwide  it did another $15 million  what was a little better  but on DVD 
[02:27:00]  in US  already  it did over $35 million  on DVD.  So you're at about $55 million.  You're just about to  break even at least.  Yeah I think we will  like in the next  one or two years  the money slowly  will kick back in.  Right?  So but  video saved me  and also video on demand  Cinema Now  and this kind of stuff  whatever  Apple  it's on  iTunes  so you can download that.  So it helps  of course  but the problem is  for example  we spend $20 million  in advertising  for the theatrical release 
[02:27:30]  and then you make  $5 million box office  then you think  exactly what you said  maybe some  we should skip  that next time.  And go right online.  You know  yeah.  Yeah let's go to  Colin in Florida.  Colin what's up?  Hey I just want to say  that recently  Hold on Colin  we got to turn  our headphones up.  Hold on man.  The volume is right there  yeah.  We need to get  that chicken audio  maybe you can  translate it for us.  Okay.  Oh yeah.  Yeah yeah yeah  that's all good.  Do you know German  pretty well?  Oh yeah.  Sorry.  Kyle what do you got? 
[02:28:00]  I just want to say  recently  I've just  thought that  Uwe is the most  charismatic director  ever.  He embraces  the audience  that hates him.  He goes in their face.  He goes in the shows  that he knows  they watch  like G4  and he'll go on  all the video game shows  and then he'll  pretty much trash  the people that  he knows they love  like Michael  and I've heard  a director  have been this  up front in a while. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah he's extremely  extremely to the point.  What do you like  about his films?  Honestly I haven't  seen one of them.  Oh you just like him  as a guy.  I will see Postal.  I will see Postal.  Which is based on  the video game obviously.  Alright.  Thank you Colin.  Thank you.  Punch it out.  So do you also  what would you say  is the most  controversial scene?  You shot some stuff  that gets a lot of flack  there was one  which actually  was a really  well shot thing  it was about  9-11  and it showed 
[02:29:00]  it was like  a window washer  sitting on the  outside of the  trade center  and the plane  is coming  and you actually  see what it looks  like for the  plane to be coming  now a lot of  people would  find it offensive  but actually  visually you can't  deny it's a  cool thing to  look at.  Yeah but the  story before is  that the two  terrorists getting  in a huge dispute  how many virgins  they're getting  actually if they  do it  and then they  call Osama  because they're  not really  sure anymore  and it turns out  that Osama  is running  out of virgins  so he says  like I cannot  promise you 
[02:29:30]  more as 20  right now  and this is  basically they  don't want to  do it anymore  but then the  machine is already  like almost  crashing into  the World Trade  Center  so I know  it's very  it's a ridiculous  thing in Postal  but I wanted  to set the tone  also  I felt like  in the last  few years  we lost a little  that kind of  ruthless comedies  of a Monty  Python for  example  or a Blues  Brothers  this kind of  stuff  disappeared  and I think  we were  it's now long 
[02:30:00]  enough where  everybody was  politically so  correct about  everything  so you start  going back  to humor  what maybe  dark  exactly  a little more  dark humor  we are a little  tired of that  Adam Sandler  Will Ferrell  kind of comedy  because it's in  a way  always the same  does Will Ferrell's  comedies  make you laugh  25 minutes  yes  exactly  you see like  one and a half  hours but you  don't  you're not  in like  entertained  after a while  anymore  and I think 
[02:30:30]  there is a  point like  there is an  audience out  I think  for a little  more like  harder  darker  stuff  and Postal  is definitely  a movie  what delivers  that  the problem  with comedies  nowadays  is the fact  that you have  to have a  message  it's like  just be funny  who gives a  shit about  a stupid  message  at the end  of the movie  and tying it  all up  into a nice  bow  I know  that's a  hack saying  but  enough  we don't  need the  message  I agree  look  in Postal  in the end  Bush and  Osama  running  hand in  hand  in the  mushroom  clouds 
[02:31:00]  right  so  it's like  this is the  end of  Postal  where  and  I think  it doesn't  need always  this kind  of  okay  we need  a wedding  and a  family  in the  end  or something  right  yeah  so  and I  like it  more  a little  has to  have  the  romantic  you know  storyline  you know  it's  just  enough  already  you know  they just  don't have  an imagination  in Hollywood  anymore  they know  the formula  and they  go with it  and it's  kind of sad  let's say  hi to  Max in 
[02:31:30]  Dallas  Max  what's  going on  hey buddy  I have  seen a  Jason  Statham  film  it was  out  and  you  out  he  talks  German  should  I  translate  yeah  sure  we're  going to  have  you  translate  he  saw  the  movie  with  Jason  Thessam  and he  liked  it  so  you  want  to  keep  talk  German  or  why  you  know  German  so  good  my  mother  is  German  out  of  Berlin  but 
[02:32:00]  it was  20  years  I'll  just  speak  English  that's  pretty  cool  actually  very  good  20  years  since  I've  been  in  Germany  and I  forgot  a lot  but  yeah  Jason  Thessam  would  kick  ass  and  you're  definitely  a cool  ass  director  thanks  thanks  it's  too bad  that  Postle  is not  in  Dallas  opening  right  now  so  we  have  only  one  screen  in  Texas  in  Austin  and  so  but  I  hope  I  get  it  to  Dallas  also 
[02:32:30]  soon  I'm  sorry  Max  I  may  interrupt  you  but  it  comes  out  I  want  to  give  a  plug  to  when  the  movie  comes  out  this  Friday  yeah  and  a  very  limited  release  and  here  in  New  York  it's  where  it's  in  Brooklyn  yeah  it's  the  Cobble  Hill  Cobble  Hill  Cobble  Hill  theater  and  we  were  fighting  till  the  very  end  to  get  a  Manhattan  screen  right  and  I  called  AMC  I  said  look  guys  you  have  the  Empire  25  with  25  screens  where  like  Vantage  Point  is  still  running  I  think  it's  already  out 
[02:33:00]  on  DVD  or  something  so  it  makes  no  sense  to  play  Harold  and  Kumar  still  on  two  screens  you  know  it's  like  there's  even  on  one  screen  almost  only  five  people  coming  every  day  so  but  they  didn't  play  it  and  I  think  it  was  a  little  too  rough  the  content  they  don't  want  to  play  it  but  I  think  it's  a  little  sad  that  you  have  let  the  audience  pick  you  know  is  America  more  sensitive 
[02:33:30]  than  like  the  audiences  in  Europe  or  England  or  is  it  pretty  much  the  same  all  over  the  board  or  are  they  babies  all  over  the  world  or  is  it  more  so  here  no  it  is  interesting  with  postal  wars  that  for  example  in  England  a  revolver  film  guy  Richie's  company  bought  it  and  they  couldn't  get  any  screens  because  they  were  like  scared  for  islamistic  like  like  islam  people  like  let's  say  throwing  stones  in  the  thing  because  we  make  fun  out  of  bin  laden  and  Mohammed  and  everything  so  this  was  problematic 
[02:34:00]  and  here  I  think  it's  a little  more  the  censorship  in  regards  of  okay  you  shouldn't  make  jokes  about  September  11  we  don't  want  to  play  the  movie  and  but  in  a  way  like  in  satire  nothing  is  holy  I  don't  make  jokes  out  of  the  victims  of  September  11  I  make  a  joke  about  the  absurd  terrorists  and  this  is  the  point  so  I  hope  slowly  we're  getting  more  screens  of  course  for  the  movie  but  we  are  right 
[02:34:30]  now  I  think  only  in  Denver  in  Chicago  in  Seattle  in  San  Francisco  LA  New  York  and  Austin  and  Atlanta  do you  is there  anything  that  you've  done  like  comedically  that you  like  I  kind  of  wish  I  didn't  do  that  like  is  there  anything  you've  said  or  you've  filmed  that  you  look  back  on  and  go  it  was  a  little  harsh  I  wish  I  would  have  done  that  differently  no  no  I  think  that  of course  that was  going to be  the answer  let's say  hi to  Danny  in  Atlanta  Danny 
[02:35:00]  hey guys  I had a quick  question  for  what was it  like  working with  Michael Madsen  in Blood  Rain  yeah let's  say when  when he was  not drunk  it was  great  he was  he came  into  Romania  where we  shot  kind of  loaded  in a way  right  yeah  and we  had like  but he  got better  and better  and better  after a  while  and he's  actually  a very  nice  guy  and he's  a very  good actor  but we 
[02:35:30]  had like  scenes  where he  was  he had  the sword  like it  was  it's a  it's a  vampire  movie  right  so he  he  should  fight  with his  sword  and  Ben  Kingsley  is in  the movie  also  and he  said  like  he  shouldn't  come  close  with  that  sword  to me  because  it was  swinging  it  a little  out  of  control  so  it  was  kind  of  hard  with  him  to  do  action  movies  like  action  scenes  in a  way  you know  and if  you see  Michael  Madsen  in his  normal  movies  he's  very  slow  like  he  walks  around  slow  talk  slow  and  kills  people  slow  but  he's 
[02:36:00]  not  the  guy  who  turns  into  Robin  Hood  so  but  he's  a  great  guy  and  he  was  one  of  the  few  actors  they  actually  supported  later  the release  of the  movie  he did  interviews  and  Virginia  Madsen  came to  the premiere  with him  together  so  he's  a very  nice  guy  if it  isn't  that  in  the  contract  where  they  have  to  do  a  certain  amount  of  press  or  no  yeah  but  it's  always  in  on  availability  and  then  they  have  cheap  excuses  do you  want to  get him 
[02:36:30]  in a  boxing ring  or what  no  no  no  Ben  King  is  a great  actor  so  I'm  happy  I just  saw the postal  scene  with the  window  washer  that's  creepy  yeah  it really  looks like  the guys  on top  of the  trade  center  it really  does  look  where  this  on  youtube  the  opening  scene  of the  movie  and  to be  honest  this  guy  at the  window  washer  is the  producer  it's Dan  Clark  okay  and he 
[02:37:00]  did  nobody  wanted to  play that  part  right  so  and he  said  I do  it  and  this  wow  is that  creepy  yeah  wow  man  you really  you almost  jump back  when you  see it  because the  way that  scene  is shot  it's just  from a  point of  view  and there's  nobody alive  you're inside  the building  yes  right  looking out  the visual  out there  looking out  the window  washers on  the outside  in the distance  you see the  plane coming  and wow  it looks real  just real  it just hits  the screen  basically  you can't 
[02:37:30]  comprehend  the speed  like  you always  wonder  when 9-11  happened  as awful  as it was  you always  wonder  what would  that have  looked like  to have  that coming  at you  I mean  it's a  human instinct  to wonder  how awful  would that  have looked  and you  can't  in your  mind  process  the speed  but on  film  you see  the plane  how fast  it's  it's  fucking  terrifying  I gotta  acknowledge  something  that's going  on instant  feedback  it's like  right down  the middle  there's a lot  of guys  that hate  you  and don't  respect you  and there's  a lot of  guys going  I fucking  love this  guy 
[02:38:00]  how does  that make  you feel  maybe I  should have  brought that  up  because I'm  in no shape  to box it  out today  but I think  that's kind  of interesting  there's no  real grey  area  they either  love you  or hate  you  out there  I know  it's this  kind of  and why  the hate  I think  the hate  came because  of House  of the Dead  and Alone  in the Dark  with Christian  Slater  two video  game based  movies  where the  game guys  didn't like  in a way  but I said 
[02:38:30]  to the guys  they hated  House of the Dead  okay this is  a Sega video  game so what  were you expecting  Schindler's List  the thing is  if you make  a movie  House of the Dead  based on a  video game  where everybody  is like  shooting  zombies in  pieces  and exactly  this is a  movie right  it's a very  brutal zombie  movie  and then they  were like  oh you  the spirit  of the game  is not on  screen  and I said  what spirit  of the game  where I played  it I was only  shooting the whole  time  so this is  kind of absurd 
[02:39:00]  that game  geeks  whatever you do  you cannot make  it right  basically  they're babies  yeah  who do you  think  you seem to  work a lot  of high profile  actors  Madsen Slater  Ben Kingsley  who do you  think is  overrated  as far as  directors are  concerned  or talent  Hollywood  because a lot  of them  get a tremendous  amount of  advertising budgets  and they put out  mediocre products  there's a point  where I went  like off  on the  Michael Bay  thing  right  so he hates  me now  who's Michael Bay  I know the name  he did  Pearl Harbor 
[02:39:30]  and Transformers  and Bad Boys  and his attorney  actually wrote me  I should not talk  about him anymore  in public  but  why  no  it's a point  like I said  I determine  who I  I can talk  about Michael Bay  right  but the point  is that for me  he is like  this guy  what has  200 million  per movie  and 80 million  dollars per movie  advertising budget  and what he makes  out of it  is poor  I don't think  there are  really like  a lot of 
[02:40:00]  like worse  war movies  as Pearl Harbor  I was really angry  when I saw Pearl Harbor  what do you think  was wrong with it  no I think  the whole  kind of  characterization  it's like a  clean advertising  spot  and after  like 20 years  after the  Deer Hunter  or Platoon  or Apocalypse Now  this kind of  great war movies  you make something  like this  with all the  technique you have  now  and then you  fail totally  in the drama  part  or also in the  message  to be honest  I think Pearl Harbor 
[02:40:30]  is a pro-war movie  it's not visible  that war  in total  is wrong  was there anything  gritty about it  anything fucking gritty  there was no balls  to it  I didn't see it  yeah absolutely  I think  it's like Ben Affleck  and Josh Hartnett  and it's the big  buddies  and whatever  when the Japanese  coming of course  there are the big heroes  and jumping  in the airplanes  and fighting  against Japan  and then later  they are also  like leading  the revenge  attack  and I think  it is pathetic 
[02:41:00]  the whole point  I didn't like it  and to be honest  in a movie like  Transformers  what got good reviews  right  but what is that  what Michael Bay  shoots there  Transformers  is like 80% CGI  yeah  you know  it's like you  you are on set  and then  the main actor  says a line  in front of a green screen  and then the real action  is behind it  so he gets all the credit  for stuff  where he has nothing  to do with  and then I get  like bashed  in the garbage ton 
[02:41:30]  with my movies  but I make physically  my movies  on my own  and the action  on my own  and everything  and there is a thing  what is a little annoying  after a while  but I'm happy  that at least  a lot of people  out there  they say  I know Uwe  is not part  of that Hollywood  system  he makes his own  stuff  and that they  support that  do you think  Indiana Jones  will be interesting  or no  because I know  that they have  a tremendous  advertising budget  and it's  every theater  you go to  there's the trailer  no I think  Indiana Jones  I would go  and see it 
[02:42:00]  yeah right  so it's  I always liked  Indiana Jones  but I felt like  with Harrison Ford  for example  that he is  way too old  normally  and it's kind  of absurd  to put him  in his dress  and have makeup  and hair fixes  everything  you know  and then  because look  why they did  Indiana Jones  is money  not because  they think  we have to keep  telling that story  about Indiana Jones  it is like  even a Spielberg  is looking  for the safe  bet now  and this is 
[02:42:30]  kind of  let's say  I think  different  or dangerous  in the film  industry right now  that they all  try to produce  only that safe  bet  and then it's  all medium  we can be  really happy  that there are  some people  every year  coming up  with like  No Country  for Old Men  There Will Be Blood  some movies  are a little  different  and against  the stream  because without  that movies  you could cancel  the Oscars  for example  because there  is nothing  anymore  yeah  what was the  last good movie  you saw  No Country  or 
[02:43:00]  I liked  No Country  I liked  for example  Before the Devil  Knows Your Dead  the Sidney Lumet  movie  was with  Philip Seymour Hoffman  was really good  and it's with  Ethan Hawke  and Philip Seymour Hoffman  and they have  both like  money problems  and it  normal people  basically  and it totally  escalates  and they start  killing people  it's a really  good movie  and  I hated  this is how  shallow I am  I hated  the name of it  so I didn't  see it  I would like  I didn't even  know  before the devil  knows you're dead 
[02:43:30]  which is  part of this  I think it's  an Irish thing  may you be  in heaven  a half hour  before the devil  knows you're dead  and it won  some awards  right  no  I don't think  so  I think it  tanked totally  to be honest  but  do the reviewers  like it  I don't even know  I didn't check it  we'll go to  Rotten Tomatoes  yeah  exactly  you can find it  out  but I think  it turns on  DVD now  into a success  also because  people are  basically  hearing about it  after you think  they're hearing about 
[02:44:00]  how good it was  exactly  and then they start  talking about it  let me  this makes his point  before the devil  knows you're dead  Rotten Tomatoes  gave it 88%  positive reviews  that's huge  it only made  just under 7 million  at the box office  right  and that shows  that  that completely proves  what you're talking  about right there  those movies are out there  but they're not getting  the proper exposure  that obviously  is a well reviewed movie  right  and with good actors  and Sidney Lumet  is like an all time  star 
[02:44:30]  it is maybe his last movie  you never know  right  he's like 82  so the thing is like  it should got more  attention  and it didn't  got more attention  and no yeah  but look we  I'm gonna go see  that movie now  because of you  you can rent it  I'll definitely  check it out  hey we got this  German audio  that we need  translated  we've been playing  this for fucking  four years  and we cannot  we know what he's doing  but we cannot  translate the audio  I think you're the  first guy that actually 
[02:45:00]  is German  who we've had  in the studio  yeah  so let's  let's play the audio  and if you can  listen for us  it's a porn track  I think it's from  a porn movie  or a sex movie  she says like  and  did you like it  did you have fun 
[02:45:30]  it's what she said  so and how  is it keep  all right  no we'll keep  stopping it  so that's what  she said  that's her  opening line  yeah yeah yeah  oh my god  all right  he says like  he's really  into the chickens  so this is what  he says  so I don't know  what he's doing  with the chickens  so she started 
[02:46:00]  off by saying  you like that  yeah you like that  that's good  right  yeah and he says  like I really  like that chickens  I'm really into  that chickens  he says like this is good 
[02:46:30]  this is good  soon soon  it looks like he's coming  or something  I'm saying soon  yeah yeah  yeah yeah  can you stop that  for a second  could you translate  what the chicken  is  I'm thinking about it  it's not a lot of dialogue  in that clip  to be honest  the chicken is probably  yelling harder  how you got that  I don't know actually 
[02:47:00]  we had the audio  yeah it was dropped off  at our front door  we don't know  we don't know  how he got that one  it was in a brown paper bag  but the whole sound  like from my own experience  yeah  in my  let's say  I don't know  what I want to say  about my own experience  but no  the thing is like  it sounds like  more of the 80s  yeah  I think it's an older  an older porn movie  did you porn direct it  or you just saw it  no it is the thing  like yeah  I mean like  I think I have a lot  of experience  in looking porn  but not making porn  what's up with the Germans 
[02:47:30]  Jimmy makes a very good  observation about this  but the Germans  their porn is a little  on the freaky side  yeah  German porn is very  very  what is that about  you think  very hardcore  yeah look  it is like  of course in Europe  way harder  in a way  like  because  sex is  no problem  even to show  like in TV  there are a lot  of erotic programs  in free TV  basically  but not hardcore  but really edgy  already  and then  so the porn movies 
[02:48:00]  must be very harsh  to get an audience  basically  to get the effect  that American porn  has  considering how  fucking watered down  TV is  I see what you're saying  okay  you have to step it up a notch  to get people interested  right  what's actually interesting  it was a funny thing  where we shot Blood Rain  in Romania  there was a free porn channel  in TV  like hardcore porn  but  it was like  it started only at midnight  so in every morning  you saw all the American crew  got like more and more tired  in the bus  driving to the set  because everybody 
[02:48:30]  and then they were sitting there  and everybody said  like you know  on weekend  on Spice Platinum  was the title of the porn channel  and then everybody  like the military weekend  is coming up  so I have to go home  like they had like  different weekends  you know the lesbian weekends  the military weekends  but it's kind of funny  that they were really into it  in the moment  they get like free porn  sure sure  outside of America  but I really went for it  you have to pay for it now  on the pay-per-view  you can't get it for free  yeah let's say hi  to John in Philly  John what's going on  hey uh  question for Ubi  um 
[02:49:00]  I remember a while ago  I heard an interview  with Zach Ward  and  get this hack off the phone  you don't like Uba?  no not really  wait but you said  get this hack off the phone  so that would be you  yeah sir  you're on the phone  no one sir  I don't know  what was the question though  he doesn't like you  if you want to know the truth  you can't go over a hack  I don't think  if you don't like him  you don't like him  people just don't like  certain directors  but I wouldn't say  I don't know much  I'm not going to lie  I don't know much about you 
[02:49:30]  Jimmy was like  oh man I did red eye  with this guy  we got to get him on  he's very interesting  he's hardcore  blah blah blah  I like the fact  that you were just  very honest about  what it is  what you do  and your humor  and you know  it was  plus punching those critics  in the face  god almighty  did I envy you  yeah look  it's  I was never really  liked  to be honest  also in Germany  not  there's a reason  that I went away  from Germany  after my last movie  1995  in Germany  you left  yeah I left 
[02:50:00]  1995  because it was like  nobody liked me  because the way  the movies I do  are always kind of  very harsh  or insulting  in a way  right  so my first movie  was actually  German fright movie  if you remember  Kentucky fright movie  sure  and we did the German version  where we made like fun  we did like suicide shows  and we actually did like  danger seeker scenes  where we  for example  we went in Walmart  and we stole everything  till the police  catched us  and with hidden cameras 
[02:50:30]  and so on  so we did a lot  of crazy stuff  and  with that  you're not really  well liked  in Germany  also with  for example  in Postal  that I'm running  that Nazi theme park  in Postal  where I play my cameo  the Germans hated that  yeah  they said like  how can you present  Germany like this  to the outside world  and I said  why  it's like  if you  like in eastern Germany  25% votes  for the Nazi party  25% 
[02:51:00]  in the last elections  right  so  and to think  like  it's all so nice  and liberal in Germany  this is what they  want to be  and of course  this is the reason  they subsidize  all that Sophie Scholl movies  or whatever  you know  they're always happy  if a Tom Cruise comes  and is doing  Stauffenberg for example  to show like  look  basically  we were all against Hitler  we always tried to kill him  but  then finally  it didn't work out  so  but the reality  was of course  different  and so  if you show now  what I do in Postal 
[02:51:30]  that Germans  are still like  sausage eating  beer drinking  Lederhosen guys  you're not getting  a lot  exactly  but you're not getting  a lot of like  plus points  in Germany  for it  what is like  in Germany now  they've gotten so weird  with language  it's illegal  to deny the Holocaust  I think  like what is  the language thing  in Germany  when it comes to  the Holocaust  or other stuff  that they really  come down on you for  no look  if you say  the Holocaust  never happened  of course  they charge you  but it's also  not allowed  for example  to have 
[02:52:00]  like a Nazi  costume on  like with  that Hakenkreuz  or whatever  so even  in like  on a party  or something  they could call  the cops  and they would  take you in  what is completely  absurd  but because  that shows  in a way  that they  are not liberal  you know  so I think  of course not  they're just trying  to change their image  they want people  to forget about  that part of their  history  and this is the thing  it's kind of funny  that they  that they're not  getting it  that they allow  a right corner party 
[02:52:30]  to go to the elections  and then all the  unemployed  white trash people  voting for the  for the Nazi party  this is not allowed  but to make fun  out of  out of whatever  having an Adolf Hitler  costume on  on a party  you get like  legal problems  so that shows  the whole absurdity  doesn't that give  it give it more power  too obviously  when you try to  ban something  like it makes  it makes it  a more powerful  image  when you say  you can't dress  like that  it makes it  even more taboo  than it already  is  so then people  just want to  do it to be 
[02:53:00]  rebellious  yeah  absolutely  and it's  no it is a lot  of stuff  what is very bad  in Europe  in general  compared to  US  to be honest  like I think  in US  is a very  kind of  it's a little  stricter here  but in Europe  you have this  kind of  wannabe  liberal  but they are  very easily  offended  by a lot  of stuff  and they  don't  they don't  support it  you see that  in Cannes  look  in the film  festivals  for example 
[02:53:30]  the typical  European movie  is totally  boring  and nobody's  interested to see it  they really are  there's a thing  they're totally  boring  and then  you have  like  Kung Fu Panda  and totally  boring European  movies  this is Cannes  and if you  make something  what is a little  more  let's say  for example  Postal  would never  get into  Cannes  because  they would  say  this is dirty  this is over  the top  this is like  ruthless  whatever  and this  are normally  I think  very positive  things  what you can  say about  the movie  but not  if you  are in  that world 
[02:54:00]  the subsidized  culture  Goethe  Institute  wasn't the Cannes  Film Festival  all about  being a little  edgy  when it first  started up  right  absolutely  and they had  like huge  scandals  in earlier days  Kung Fu  Panda  I have not  heard of that  that's the  Jack Black  movie  right  animated  animated  you know  it's a  panda  that does  Kung Fu  Jesus  literal  yeah  so there's  a point  it's like  it's kind  of  that a  movie like  this gets  made  is already  a joke  but the  point is 
[02:54:30]  that of  course it's  a children  movie  and it's  okay  but  why it  takes away  for example  a possible  screen timing  can from a  movie what  could make  a big  scandal  or what  could  open up  a discussion  about  something  but this  is a long  big theme  and I  hope that  good and  controversial  movies are  still getting  an audience  at latest  on DVD  alright let's  say hi to 
[02:55:00]  where are we  going  Lenny  Connecticut  what's up  Lenny  Lenny  hey dudes  how are you  doing today  happy birthday  Jimmy  thank you  oh yes  no they just  say it to me  it's bizarre  before the devil  knows you're  dead  it's got  some great  naked  Marissa  Tomei  in it  and you get  to watch  Philip Seymour  Hoffman  fucking her  I'd like to  see Philip Seymour  Hoffman  fucking anybody  I mean the  last person  he hit on  was fucking  Mark Wahlberg  in Boogie  so I'd be  happy to see  him fucking  anybody  she's smoking 
[02:55:30]  in the movie  she really is  how old is she  now  when she did  my cousin  Vinny a  shitload of  years ago  she's got to  be I think  she's 40  I think she  turned 40  recently  yeah  she looks  good I  agree  absolutely  let's go to  Canada  David what's up  what I mean  you rule  but I was  just wondering  if you could  tell me  what you  think of  the movie  Agwar  the wrath  of God  you know  I won't  waste your  time  but I was  just curious  what movie  what are you  asking buddy  Agwar  the wrath  of God  sorry the  director there  oh okay  Agwar 
[02:56:00]  the wrath  of God  so Werner  Herzog's  movie  with Klaus  Kinski  okay  you mean  that movie  did you mean  that movie  I don't know  yeah it's  from Werner  Herzog's  the guy who  did also  Fitz  and so it's  a very good  movie  but it's  like 30  years old  right so  I had to  get back  way back  in memory  but it's  a good  movie  I'm glad  that guy  asked a  question  that two  people care  about  but then he  hung up  without clarifying  who he was  talking about  it's gonna  answer you  buddy 
[02:56:30]  and no one  else cared  I don't know  he was asking  us or over  is it time  to dance  or  what  it's a  sprocket  joke  what's  what's  sprocket  you don't  remember  the old  SNL  no  remember  the SNL  bit  sprockets  let's go  to Roy  the trucker  Roy  yes I  was curious  how come  you couldn't  get this  film  it's a  Sundance  film chain  not the  festival  but there's  a chain  of theaters  called the 
[02:57:00]  Sundance  around the  country  and they're  always playing  films like  his  I know  we tried  it  and they  are still  thinking  about it  they think  a long  time now  about it  to be  honest  it's like  we asked  we asked  yeah  how about  fantastic  place to  see esoteric  films like  yours  it's great  and keep  up the good  work  I've seen  a few  of your  films  already  it's  terrific  thank you  all right  how about  did you try  the Angelica  I mean  they  they  did the  first one  of the  show  Slingblade  down in  Houston  Street  they showed  some  I'm  disappointed  about the  Angelica  film  center 
[02:57:30]  here  because  what  happened  is  that  they  got a  screener  and lost  the screener  and then  we send  another  screener  you know  especially  to lose  the screen  of a  movie  what is  not out  on DVD  is a big  risk  that the  movie  pops up  on the  internet  so this  was  first of  all  for us  very bad  but the  second  thing  is that  they  got  the  screener  and now  they  didn't  call  us  back  and we  said  look  Friday  is the  opening  maybe  they can  show it  one week  later  but  it  was a lot 
[02:58:00]  of  disappointing  stuff  for example  we showed  in the  Tribeca  one screening  of the  movie  and we  had 50  people  too many  there  they have  to go  home  so I  asked  Tribeca  you want  to show  the movie  only if  you give  us five  grand  so that  you give  me half  of the  box office  and I  said  but you  saw  that there  were people  popping up  and that  the thing  was sold  out  and that  people  had to  go home  why you  don't 
[02:58:30]  show it  to the  audience  now  because I  don't think  that there's  a big risk  that Postal  nobody wants  to see  there will be  some audience  coming up  and they  don't play  it so  they are  like  some  art house  screens  are so  arty in  a way  that they  want to  show only  movies for  like an  absolutely  minority  you know  like I  don't know  Greece  subtitled  movies or  whatever  we are  specialized  in this  since 25  years  I'm sorry  to interrupt you  my ex-girlfriend  and I went  to a movie  recently  we were  going to  see something  I wanted  to see  something  I forget  what  and she  wanted to  see this 
[02:59:00]  movie at  the Paris  Theater  which was a  subtitled movie  in Brazil  about some  political upheaval  where a Brazilian  boy is taken  in by a  it was  fucking  awful  it was  fucking  unwatchable  shit  it was  boring  I mean  I didn't  know it was  well acted  I was reading  the subtitles  but it  fucking  the story  stunk  go to  Sundance  you know  in the  Sundance  Film Festival  I saw 
[02:59:30]  the winner  of the Sundance  Film Festival  on DVD  last week  and it is  completely  disaster  you think  what's going  on with  that people  that they  think this  was a good  movie  what movie  was it  it was a  Puerto Rican  kind of movie  where a guy  was like  robbed  and then of  course  because he's  robbed  it's all a  disaster  in his life  but the  thing is  that they  are not  good mates  they are not  engaging  you're not  going for  the actors  and I  think there  is this  kind of  strange  thing  you do  something 
[03:00:00]  what gets  hyped  by the  critics  or in  a festival  like Sundance  it's so  hot  it's so  hot  and then  as soon  Sundance  is over  and it's  only blanks  a movie  and you  competed  with tons  of other  movies  then you  see like  it was  only that  moment  in Sundance  where  everybody  thought  this is  great  and then  it  disappears  tell me  one Sundance  movie  of the last  10 years  what turned  into a big  success  I honestly  don't know  what they  showed  to be  honest  although I  like to  act  Jimmy's a  very good  actor  do you 
[03:00:30]  have a  monkey  do you  have a  monkey  no  I got  problems  with the  monkey  in Postal  what do you  mean  in Postal  the monkeys  rape  Verne Troyer  I forgot  about the  monkeys  rape  Verne Troyer  in Postal  so he gets  raped by monkeys  and then I  got a letter  from Peter  from the  animal  organization  blaming me  for it  and they  said  how can  you  use  monkeys  raping  a  guy  and I  said  look  the guy  got  raped  not the  monkey  and the 
[03:01:00]  other thing  is we're using  cats as  silencers  in Postal  so Peter  didn't saw  that scene  so far  otherwise I get  another letter  if they saw  that scene  right  okay  that was  more Sprockets  humor for you  Jimmy  can I say  my friend  my friend  a good friend  of mine  Liza  texted me  and I think  she's a very  German  lovely lady  and she said  I fucking  love this guy  please get a  picture with him 
[03:01:30]  I already have  one though  from Red Eye  together  Liza  you're way  behind  I got  red eye  today  yes you are  very ill  yeah I'm  dying over here  well very  very good  I think we're  going to take  a break  cool  so the movie's  called Postal  and now  you know  I'm going to  watch a few  of your movies  now  see what it's  all about  where can you  get most  you get a  website or  something or  where can you  get most of  your films  the best is  you put my  name in  on IMDB  and you see  all the movies  popping up  for example  and all the  bad reviews  popping up 
[03:02:00]  also  all the bad  reviews  what do you  think of  Hasselhoff  David Hasselhoff  I'm a member  of his fan club  in Germany  why do the  Germans like  him  I really  don't like  him but  I think  he has  this kind  of strange  career  and so  I feel  a little  connected  to him  he's a  good singer  not really  I didn't  even like  Knight Rider  to be honest  or Baywatch  it's like  I never saw  that shows  I liked 
[03:02:30]  Bonanza  and Rockford  Files  you know  the Rockford  Files  I loved  that show  Quincy  Quincy was  okay  and I  loved  Kojak  you loved  Kojak  I loved  that show  a little  known fact  about him  he was  missing  all sorts  of pieces  of his  body  yeah  oh my god  he was  missing an  ear  a couple  fingers  all from  smoking  oh yeah  smoking  I believe  he was  smoking  but he  had some  weird parts  of his  body  missing  I love  when he  quit the 
[03:03:00]  cigarettes  and had  to go to  the lollipops  couldn't stop  sticking things  in his  fucking  Greek mouth  how do you  not love  telly  what's  Dieter doing  these days  Dieter  who's that  who's that  just more  Sprockets  humor  sorry  I know  what Sprockets  is  I don't know  what that is  Dieter is a  name  I think it's  the allergy  medicine  kicking in  all I want to  know  is the Sprockets  fading away  who do you  think  before we  take a break  I want to  ask  who do you 
[03:03:30]  think is  the best  commercial  director  let's say  mainstream  guy out there  I like  Michael Mann  for example  you know him  yeah  Miami Vice  was not good  but he did  some good  movies for  example  Collateral  I liked  for example  and of course  Heat  and  no yeah  but look  Steven Spielberg  did great  movies  I love  some movies  other movies  I hate  like War of the  Worlds  for example  yeah  it was a  disaster  yeah  so but  that movie  was a disaster  yeah 
[03:04:00]  but Jaws  was great  and this was  the whole point  where I made  jokes about  Spielberg  because we're  getting out  on the same  weekend  as Indiana Jones  where I said  he got sloppy  because of  War of the Worlds  right  and then people  flip completely  out on me  they don't get it  that I was not  serious about it  right  so but  now yeah  but there are  a lot of  let's say  it's not this  time anymore  where you say  one guy makes  only good movies  Marty Scorsese  is a great  director  and I love  but the  great movies  from him  Raging Bull  or Taxi Driver  are all like  25 years old 
[03:04:30]  did you think  that watching  The Departed  I thought  it was a little  overrated  it was decent  but a little  overrated  I agree with you  Jimmy  did you think  what did you think  of The Departed  yeah  it made  like  if you really  analyze it  you see that  the story  is completely  ridiculous  but the point  is  that  they had to  give him  an Oscar  at one point  and a lot  of directors  getting that  too late  so they  felt like  we don't want  to give him  the Oscar  for the  Rolling Stones  documentary  so let's give him  the Oscar  for Departed 
[03:05:00]  they threw him  a bone  and they  should have  wasn't that  why they  I think  they had  Spielberg  I want to  say Coppola  and George  Lucas  were the  three guys  who presented  him  so that was  probably why  just to get  that photo  of all  he deserved  it  let's say  he really  deserved it  but I think  you see also  that great  directors  getting really  bad  like Oliver Stone  for example  is a guy  who made  great movies  what I think  with JFK  for example  Platoon  Salvador  and he 
[03:05:30]  completely  lost it  in a way  like a  World Trade  Center  I couldn't  stand that  to have  that where  I read  the thing  like Nicolas Cage  like in the  World Trade  Center  fighting for  the life  of everybody  I felt like  I think to be  honest this  is an insult  to make a  movie like  this at all  it's completely  absurd  I like to  see as many  movies as  possible  I just  had no desire  to see that  movie  exactly  to this day  I haven't seen  it  no  and I saw  five minutes  in the airplane  and then I  switched it off 
[03:06:00]  it's actually  funny that they  showed it  they showed it  on a plane  what airline  I'm going to  guess it was  not an American  carrier  no it was  Air Canada  they fucking  hate us  they hate us  we got to  take a break  we got Anthony  calling in next  he's on his  way home  finally from  the big date  night  so we'll get  an update  from Anthony  I want to  thank you for  stopping by  it was really  great having  you man  I hope to do  right out with  you again  I want to  see a lot of  your stuff  I'm a fan of  you as a guy  so now I  want to see  all your work  very good  thank you  and Postal

Dieter  what?  the SNL thing  I gotta tell you Jimmy  that interview  was tiresome 
[03:08:00]  was it?  yeah  you didn't like them?  it was very tiresome  why?  no see more sprockets  humor  oh  see I got you  on that one  I liked him  see because you  thought you knew  what you were doing  with the dance thing  and then I flip it  and then I really  trick you  and say that the  interview was tiresome  but that's another  sprocket thing  but tricking and hurting  seem to be the same  thing lately  ladies and gentlemen  he's in the middle  of doing  the walk of shame  it's Anthony  Cumia  hi  hey buddy  what's up Anthony  what happened 
[03:08:30]  you didn't come in  today  yeah  I was feeling  a little poorly  is the date  officially over  uh  no  now  is this still  a comfortable date  or basically  you just won't leave  yeah  is the alcohol  starting to wear off  and you're both  looking at each other  kind of awkwardly  you're falling in love  and she's getting  nauseous  no 
[03:09:00]  it's amazing  how well  duct tape holds  so what happened  man  you texted me  last night  that you were a little  it was very funny  you text about  Colin  his scenarios  were making you laugh  yeah  yeah  while I was driving in  and all I could think  about was Colin's  horrific scenarios  about how we  won't have anything  to talk about  except Long Island  and traffic  right  and um  well that wasn't  the case  what happened  yeah  take us through  the date a little bit  at least  like you got your hair 
[03:09:30]  did at John's Hog  and then what happened  uh  then we  then we  um  went  to a dinner  at  some place  that  that Keith  booked  ah  that um  I gotta tell Keith  I'm a little disappointed  why  I don't know  it wasn't  quite the intimate  nice  kind of restaurant  I wanted  uh  like there were  tables  pretty close  to our table  and  a bunch of  friggin 
[03:10:00]  old ladies  sitting there  talking about  their  1990  cell phones  and how they  don't work  and  it just wasn't  you know  the atmosphere  what kind of restaurant  I'm in Matt  I think you went  Italian right  of course  of course  we did  went Italian  but it wasn't  the type of place  that you would have  booked on your own  no  not on my own  no  you should have taken  out of Morton's  how is the food  uh  what food  we don't know 
[03:10:30]  you don't know  no  um  let's see  I think I had  two pieces of lettuce  uh huh  and  Jill had  some  cherry tomatoes  and  cheese  uh huh  and then our  dinner came  but  the wine  was a little  more important  so you guys  just looked at  the dinner  it sat  in front of us  for hours  as we just  drank  bottles of wine 
[03:11:00]  bottles  how many bottles  um  two at the  restaurant  and then  one more  somewhere else  holy shit  where else  did you drink  the wine  uh  let me see  in the car  probably  driving in the  LA  at Jill's house  okay  at Jill's house  yeah  that's  that's  so you guys  got along well  you were just  talking about  work and stuff  and  yeah  how was the  conversation  we were talking  about work 
[03:11:30]  and um  you know  cause we're both  broadcasters  yeah  yeah  and when did you  realize that you  might be able to  I mean I don't even  know if you did  but when did you  realize that you  might be able to  sneak a kiss  like on the cheek  at least  well we're assuming  too much Jimmy  I mean was there  kissing involved  I don't know  Anthony Copia  I think we made  a disgusting display  at the restaurant  oh my  well can I  why  I showed a lot  of restraint  my uh  my pal  uh  pictures 
[03:12:00]  what  and we have  pictures  are we gonna be  posting pictures  somewhere  I don't know  you guys  you guys are  heading toward  a reality show  maybe we  we should film  a reality show  that we just  throw up on our  website  little vignettes  with Anthony  and Jill  they already  did that  it's called  the days  of wine  and roses  wine  and more  wine  oh my god  I just erased  your text messages  by accident  because my phone  filled up 
[03:12:30]  oh my god  I just lost  the evidence  and I was  reading your text  messages this  morning  and I was  putting blanks  in very important  places  well  I was just  talking about  how we were  making a  disgusting display  of um  you know  public display  of affection  yeah they were  uh  you were  you were  it's safe  we didn't even  notice  like I wasn't  looking around  or anything  but I'm sure  the old people  were horrified  right  what was going 
[03:13:00]  on at our table  so you guys  were like uh  just having a  make out session  right at the table  yeah  who kissed  who Anthony  yeah how did  that go down  I don't know  it was one of  those like  movie moments  where you just  kind of look  into each other's  eyes and you  know  oh my god  a movie moment  I don't think  it was a movie  moment  yeah it was  the wine  so did she  only want to  have a couple  of drinks  and then you  just kept  saying  I'm pleased 
[03:13:30]  you appreciate  good wine  actually  she took  the wine  right  yeah she  picked the  wine  and um  wait wait  it could say  a lot about  her  what kind  of wine  oh yeah  what was it  I would imagine  like it was  some nice  she probably  picked a  like a  California  Merlot  2004  2005  it was some  Italian wine  wasn't it  oh really 
[03:14:00]  yeah  very nice  so did you  say anything  while she was  eating her  cherry tomatoes  um  yeah we were  talking the  whole time  okay  yeah it  wasn't anything  like Colin's  stupid fantasy  of a disaster  date  were you  concerned that  she wasn't  eating more  no I wasn't  concerned with  anything  food  or rice  so did you  uh did you  guys have a 
[03:14:30]  lot in  common  yeah  yeah  from Long  Island  uh-huh  um both  Italian  uh-huh  um  we have  similar  interests  uh-huh  everyone in  her family  has my  name  wow  I know  we we  learned that  yesterday  um  yeah  oh and  and she's  got a really  good sense  of humor  because  in her  her bag  yeah  she brought  beer  oh really  yeah because  that was a  gag yesterday  I know  well they're  paying 
[03:15:00]  they're playing  Long Island  trashy  she'll just  like bring  beers in her  bag  yeah they're  paying close  attention to  our show  you know  that  yeah  yeah  and she  brought  beer  and we  started  drinking  beer at  the table  right  major D  came over  and yelled  at us  saying  we do  not serve  this here  oh really  shut up  shut your  trap  went down  in beers  at the table  and they  don't even  serve  so you  never ate  your dinner  that means  there was  some fine  conversation  going on  and some  fine sucking  of the 
[03:15:30]  faces  there was  fine  conversation  going on  yes  and um  yeah  and we  were making  a scene  did you  have a  rod  did you  squeeze  her boobies  well did you  get a rod  when you were  kissing  that's not  a bad  question  did you  brush her  boobies  with your  hand  by accident  oh my  god  what is  going on  you had a  rod  of course  he had a  rod  i actually  i heard how  the date  ended up  she was  very badly 
[03:16:00]  raped  you see  how many  uh  how many hours  sleep  uh  did you get  that's a good  question  um  well  i don't know  really  we slept  uh huh  there was sleep  involved  how does  how does  jill feel  no  she's dead  what  i fucked  up  you got

[03:17:00]  that we  got  hitched  but  um  what was  i going  to ask  so  how long  were you  at the  restaurant  and then  if  you share  whatever you  want  and then  what  happened  um  i don't  remember  how long  we were  actually  at the  restaurant  because  we can't  quite put  the piece  together  everything  right  like um  you know  times and  stuff  right  but uh  and of course  you had a  you had a  driver last  night of  course  right  oh yeah  yeah  yeah  i would  never  um  i would  never drive  like that  did you guys  go to like

[03:36:00]  steve  these fucking  it's 1047  and i'll take the hit on this one  i set a fucking reminder for myself  and it fucking didn't go off  and here it is  right here  how do we not know this shit  we gotta know when they're doing an emergency broadcast  he forgot to tell us  all right  um  i've known anthony a long time  um  he's in deep shit  that man is in deep shit  he's in the big leagues  anthony is in  the big leagues  right 
[03:36:30]  yeah  what do you think jimmy  everything i've heard  she's  she's awesome  but you could  you could just hear  in his voice  she's a very very  dude  you know anthony  he wouldn't do anything for anyone  he's  going to  help her get her cats neutered  i think that's what makes anthony special though  is he only does  anthony doesn't do phony things  he'll do select things  like if he really likes  i think anthony's probably very good to a chick he dates 
[03:37:00]  and a chick he likes  oh sure  he's very generous and good with his friends  right  but uh  outside of that  he's a fucking  he's a lizard  right  he's a fucking cold blooded  but to his friends  and to anyone he's dating  he's fucking great  wow  sucked his cock  what a day  what a day  oh uh  i'm so annoyed that that happened  in the middle of this call  yeah i understand  we got  we got most of uh  the meat  meat and potatoes out there  we could have had all of it  can we get the  the whole call for the  for the replay or whatever 
[03:37:30]  okay so for the 20 seconds you missed  i don't think there was much  i thought it was a minute  well how long was it steve  how long is that dumb  it's not long  i think it's under a minute  under a minute  okay so we'll  we'll fix that up for the uh  the replay today  that's for sure  uh jimmy's be  is going to be taping his hbo show  tonight yeah  i think it's  tonight and tomorrow  seven or eight yeah  i'm not sure what time  uh  support jimmy and what he's doing  it's a it's a huge huge opportunity  for jim norton  yeah i'm very happy man  the dice thing yesterday was interesting  yeah it was a long 
[03:38:00]  it was long but uh  i was i was happy that it happened  and uh not even for this for the future  it's like it's like it's  it's a long enough time  everybody's been fucking fighting already  and i hate it  yeah yeah we'll see what happens  i i've reflected after uh the whole thing  and uh you know  it is what it is  i wasn't uh  i wasn't blown away either way  to be honest with you  that too much time has passed by  uh  i respect the fact that he came in here  yeah absolutely  that's for sure  um  i don't know  but he's a kook  i gotta say 
[03:38:30]  he's definitely nutty  and i think he would admit  that he's nutty  he's not good with uh  because i really started thinking about  like um  we  he did that garden show  in what 2000  yeah  and uh  we weren't really friends yet  but  in 2000  i said something  to him  that his kid heard  and then  after that point  we became friends  for  for a long time  and then somewhere  he decided that  what happened in front of his son  which i actually respect  i do respect that part of it  um  had to come out 
[03:39:00]  and then he had to  like hate me  and i'm like  that is really  i'm just saying  that's weird  i can  where i come from  that is bizarre  i can make sense of it though  in in the sense that  whenever someone  like we all get  these weird resentments  that we hold up  like that all of a sudden happens  and you tuck it away  like yeah whatever  it's fine  right  because i was saying to you  yesterday in the cab  like when you guys were riding home  like hanging out in the  in the mountain and stuff  he wasn't mad at you  or thinking about that  that was real  but then like you go through  an awful divorce  which i've never been through  and i know the kids get involved  and when the like 
[03:39:30]  i think whenever the lid blows off  shit and all this  fucking anger comes out  like don't forget  he stopped talking to me  he stopped talking to you  he stopped talking to kenny  it was like all this shit  blows out  um  you know  and it's like maybe  that was one thing  maybe he thought of that one day  right  and all of a sudden  it fueled a rage  like who knows  it's irrational  when you're going through  that kind of anger  about a marriage breaking up  uh and and there's kids involved  and shit's going back and forth  man  emotionally people i think  just fucking really react  weird  and they go off into weird tangents 
[03:40:00]  i don't think that's that crazy  because uh  i don't know  a divorce like that's pretty messy  and pretty ugly  and i was more concerned  about getting an answer for kenny  because i knew  it just killed him  that uh  you know  him and uh  dice haven't talked  uh  in i don't know  four years or something  and what kenny worked for him  for 15 years  on and off for 15 years  so kenny got some closure  i uh  i thought it was interesting  what he had to say  i don't know  i  we'll see what happens  i'm not  i don't  i'll be honest  i don't carry the way  i mean we 
[03:40:30]  we had some  great times  and we did great radio  with him back in the day  and uh  we'll see what happens  by the way the message boards  i understand  like fucking flea  you really irritated me  um  because i understand  people are loyal to the show  but when  when the guy comes back on  and people are like  fuck him  it's like i get it  like that's the radio shit thing  but it's like  then we can't win either way  because  it's like when he's not on  people are like  well he was really funny  and he'll be wise  you're not on  right  and he comes in  and he pretty much just talks  for two hours  as far as  what was going on with him 
[03:41:00]  and uh  you know  i think he was being honest  because he said the same thing to me  when i was alone with him  right  and he's more introspective  and i've known him for years  he's more introspective  than i've ever seen him before  and something else happened  which didn't come up on the air  which he doesn't want brought up on the air  but let's just say  and it's like  when somebody goes through certain things  and they come out the other side of it  and people are still like  fuck him  it's like you know what  people fight  that's flea man's post right there  i can't really read it  yeah i have it  it's not even that offensive  it's more like  it was just annoying 
[03:41:30]  i understand that norton had to  for his hbo  and completely respect that  what he has to do  but what norton has to do  for his show  shouldn't reflect upon o and a  fuck you flea  fuck you  can i tell you how this whole thing went down  uh this hbo opportunity for jimmy  is huge  huge  and i just uh  i i pulled jimmy aside  i go look dude  you know  uh having dice  you know that could be good for your show  but there's there's issues there  and some some way or another 
[03:42:00]  you're gonna have to deal with it  and uh that's what we did  that's what we did  i mean  i think dice being on this show  was gonna work either way  yeah  but uh jimmy  he could have said  yeah whatever  but jimmy actually spent the whole day  what day are we up to  i guess the whole day monday  uh trying to figure out  what what he could do  to make uh the situation better  and would he be willing to come back  for real  and he even said  it can't just be like a thing  for the show  because people smell bullshit  but the guy sat here for two hours  and i  and look  the reality is 
[03:42:30]  he's doing a ten minute set tonight  right  he's not doing an hour  in front of a hostile crowd  right  he's doing ten minutes  of the tv taping  right  with other comedians  i don't think he's gonna get booed  i think he's gonna be fine  and uh  you know  he came up here by himself  no posse  you know  because uh  dice when he uh  when he uh  walks around town  he could be intimidating  because he's got a lot of animals with him  and he decided  that if  if it's gonna be a real moment  he's gonna come up by himself  uh  and he left most of the shtick  outside the door  and uh  and i respect that much 
[03:43:00]  i guess  i i don't know  it just doesn't feel the same  uh  with me and him  and that happens  whatsoever  that happens after people fight  i i have to at least say that  i i respect  why he was mad  i uh  respect the fact that  he came up here  into the lion's den  and all that crap  but  i don't know  i think there's too much damage  that was done  to be honest with you  i'm not  i'm not saying  that should  that should definitely not affect  the fact that he's doing something  for jimmy tonight  i want to make that perfectly  fucking clear  well  it's  it's one of those things  that when people 
[03:43:30]  i mean when people fight  fuck  flee  fuck you  motherfucker  what now  just that  he's putting capitals  what he has to do  but what norton has to do  for his show  shouldn't reflect upon  oh and a  like i said  hey guys  go against everything  you  you fucking little  cunt  you fucking little  cunt  you fucking  hanger on  faggot  fuck you  you know  and a lot  some people  question my motives like that  you fucking little  cunt  and some people 
[03:44:00]  uh  you know the haters  they're not real fans  they were trying to like  get it going  that we were kissing his ass  and all that uh  yesterday  and there was  there really wasn't man  i didn't  i didn't really  i didn't back down  from my position  i listened to what he had to say  and i made it perfectly clear  that you know  his thinking  sounds a bit  insane  it was  absolutely  but i don't know why  it's like  when people have shit happen  it's like  people fucking fight  especially with the radio show  it happens 
[03:44:30]  there was a fucking  and it was weird  because you guys  were very close friends  but he didn't talk to me  for two years  yeah  and again  if he had trashed me  or whatever  i'm sure i would have  been much angry about it  but i was kind of  just booted off a tour  and i was very fucking angry  i was very angry  because there was no explanation  and we didn't even bring this up  in front of dice  but yeah  there was a point  that dice blew off jimmy  for what  how many years  two  at least two years  we didn't talk at all  and then  then it was just a casual  what you ran into him  out there in la  so i'm at the comedy store  and uh  we hugged  like when he walked in 
[03:45:00]  he hugged everybody here  and we talked about it  and we talked through  what happened  and uh  when he was talking to me  about going through the divorce  and being unable to talk  or communicate anything  at that point  i believed him  and i knew he was telling me  the truth  and that was probably  about a year and a half ago  um  so i knew exactly  what he was saying  and i understood  what he was going through  something fucking crazy  at that time  fuck it  that kind of shit happens  right  but for you to sit there  and if people  i'm not saying fuck you  to everybody that doesn't want  that's your business  in your position  that's cool 
[03:45:30]  i don't agree with you  but that's fine  but flea you personally  you fucking little jizz bag  what he has to do  shouldn't affect  what's on the O&A show  like i totally disregarded  the O&A show  you fucking little cunt  fuck you  there you go  you know  faggot  my position  my position  after the show  it felt very weird  very um  just very  just  it's not  it's not the same  i do need to say that  for myself  it's not the same 
[03:46:00]  i felt the same way  the first time i saw him  to be honest with you  will it uh  turn into  something again  i don't  i don't really hold  out hope for that  i don't  i don't wish anything bad  uh  to happen to him  or any of that crap  but  you know  i mean we  we have  we have what we did  back in the day  is is what i'm  what i'm saying  you know  we'll see i guess  you know  i wasn't  i wasn't moved either way  yesterday  i gotta be honest  it was just  it was  i was  i don't know  it was weird  too much time passed 
[03:46:30]  too many really exciting things  have happened for me  personally  that my friends  were a part of  and i look at him  like  wow you were  in my eyes  you were in that  like circle of friends of mine  and it's like  i don't know  you know what i'm trying to say  it's like  yeah  but it's like  when time passes with anything  it's like  and don't forget  the first time you see somebody  after all that shit that was said  right  yeah  it's understandable  to fucking not be moved either way  it really is  but if time goes on 
[03:47:00]  because it's like  what i wanted to see was  people getting along  because he is funny on the radio  when he comes on  he's very funny  dude we did  we're pretty honest here man  we did great radio with him  i mean great  exceptional radio with him  exceptional  and i  that's not what i had the problem with  right of course  um  because i really  i mean  i don't know  another real moment  we're having way too many real moments  i like it  it's that phony shit  it's a fucking zoo cruise  let them do it  i take uh  i take my relationships very seriously  i take my friendships very seriously  i don't have a lot of friends 
[03:47:30]  but the ones i do have  i take extremely serious  you know  i'm very tight with my family  i take that whole thing very serious  i understand  i understand that  norton had to do  for his hbo show  and completely respect that  that's what he has to do  first of all  you cunt faggot  i'm a part of this show  let me  let me  you fucking cunt  but he  he doesn't get it  and a lot of other guys  don't get it  jimmy did this  jimmy did this  more for me  way more for me  than the show  hbo wanted 
[03:48:00]  wanted dice as well  and and  it would have been fine  even if we didn't have dice  on the show yesterday  it just would have  without getting into details  there would have been things done  that it would have made the taping  completely  fine  and i will be  so jimmy did not have to do this  for this hbo opportunity  that he has  that i think is  is really  important for jimmy  and his career  when i was talking to andrew  uh  it became apparent  that he really wanted to fix things  and it wasn't just this  because let's be honest 
[03:48:30]  at a tv taping  most people  are going to be cool  at a tv taping  i mean  carlos mencio  you want the reality  carlos mencio  went out in front of a crowd  that was  that was actively booing him  and he fucking destroyed  that really wasn't a concern  i wanted to see it  you know  everybody behaving  when we had carlos  on our comedy tour  last summer  yeah we were all backstage  going wow  i wonder how this is gonna  you know turn out  because a lot of uh  a lot of the fans  you know  do have a problem with carlos  because some of the things  that have been said  by these comics and stuff 
[03:49:00]  and we talked to carlos  he goes look  you know  i'll be fine  either way  and he went out there  and they tried to  boom off the stage  they really did  or a small group  by the end of it  he pretty much  got a standing ovation  threw the mic down  like he was a rock star  he had one of the best  sets of the night  easily  easily  and the same thing  would have happened  with the hbo taping  that flea  i want to fucking  i just  i hate your fucking guts  and it's not  for anything you said  about dice  and it's not  for not agreeing 
[03:49:30]  with him being on the show  here's uh  here's flea  uh flea  for what  what  flea  hi hi  first  jim first of all  i'm really sorry  if i angered you  i didn't mean to  well look  you don't  i don't want  you don't need  to apologize  dude  i'm not even asking  you to change  your opinion  you're entitled  to say what you want  but it  that  those two lines  that makes me  fucking hate your guts  if you don't like dice  and you don't like him  on the show  that's fine  but like  i understand what  norton had to do  and respect that's  what he had to do  like fuck jim  uh 
[03:50:00]  what i do  shouldn't affect  ona  like the three of us  don't interact  and affect each other  on a daily  you fucking  douchebag  well what i meant  is jim  what i meant  is like  what you do  personally in your  career  if you wanted  to do that  it's okay  i just didn't  i got what you  meant flea  i speak and read  english  i got what you  meant  okay  but i'm  i just  i was just  you know  expressing my opinion  about how i felt  about it  i know what you  were doing flea  i didn't question  that  i know you're  expressing your  opinion  i didn't ask you  to take it down 
[03:50:30]  or say that you  shouldn't be allowed  to constitutionally  i get it  but it makes me  hate your guts  well i'm  you know  i don't know  i'm sorry  i didn't mean for  you to hate my guts  irrelevant  everyone  everyone fucking  hate you  do you wonder  why no one  likes you  for real  i'm not  i'm not even  kidding  you're a dumb  motherfucker  that's why  not anything you  said about dice  your opinion  with him being 
[03:51:00]  on  all of that's  acceptable  that's your  opinion  but what you're  doing by doing  that you  fucking asshole  is you're  questioning my  motives  and you're  implying that  like i don't  care how  anything affects  opie personally  or anthony  personally  i'm putting a  personal agenda  on it  when i have  never done that  on the show  we were off the  air for two years  i wouldn't even do  radio shows  that had a problem  with opie and anthony  i was on the road  that's one of the  reasons dice kicked  me off the tour  because i wouldn't  help promote  chicago by going  on man cow  yeah and maybe  we didn't make  that clear 
[03:51:30]  but uh i have  no doubt in my  mind that jimmy  did that more  for me than  anything i mean  dice was uh  booked to do  uh jimmy's show  for hbo he was  in town it was a  good opportunity  and jimmy said  wow yeah we  you're right we  there is no closure  to all that crap  that went on and  let's see what we  could uh work out  he worked he  worked the dice  thing all fucking  day while i was  dealing with a  pretty serious  personal issue on  long island and i  was driving back to  the city and jimmy  i've known jimmy  for what 10 years  now  yeah and uh  the jimmy i got 
[03:52:00]  on the phone call  driving back from  long island monday  was a different  jimmy i was like  wow he was really  affected by uh  by his time with  dice uh at lunch  on monday we had  me and opie had a  real talk in the  cab on the way  home actually a  walk home and  then i talked it  just the whole thing  with this merger  happening uh all  that stuff it just  i guess i get tired  of the fighting i  hate the fact that  florentine doesn't  come on like i  love the fact that  nick is coming on  right and guys are  crossing over  florentine used to  do our show back  in the day and  how what happened  with florentine was 
[03:52:30]  really simple we  just did we had in  the beginning there  we had too many guys  and we didn't have  room for florentine  unfortunately and then  he got an opportunity  with howard and the  rest is history but he  used to do a bunch of  stuff for us back in  the day and we love  jim jim's one of my  best friends uh i'm  happy he's doing the  tape i mean you know  he's but i hate the  fact that like him and  levy and we're not  all it's just like all  these comics we're all  having a good time and  i hate any of that  fighting i just hate it  when we're all friends  right and uh it was  awkward having andrew  here yes it was weird  but it's like let's i 
[03:53:00]  say you fast forward a  year and he comes in a  bunch of times and  makes calls all of a  sudden this like it  sounds corny but  everybody's like okay  again right then you're  having fun times again  and i fucking hate the  fact that a bunch of  friends we'll see what  happens yeah it's  possible i um oh what  was the what was the  uh wow i just don't  like that fucking this  little douchebag  questioning my motives  when i wasn't  questioning yes that's  exactly what that is you  fucking asshole  no it wasn't it wasn't  questioning your motive  i openly said that it  was questioning dice's  motive yeah no but you 
[03:53:30]  said you said what i  have to do for my  career shouldn't affect  ona  no that's it's not what  you have to do it's  what you want to do  whatever you fucking  semantics just bucket  we're all one and the  same why do you think  that audience is there  why do you think that  the hbo specials i've  done i've had open  and they stand up and  thank them because they're  a part of this thing  with me right and that  audience is there because  of these guys and and  flee uh they're not  separate dice was not  coming on our show he  was booked to do the  hbo show with jimmy it  was set in stone there 
[03:54:00]  was no reason for him to  do our show yeah the  timing looks a little  weird but either way  dice was going to do  jimmy's show and he  was going to do just  fine but but it was an  opportunity because he  was in town and i did  tell jimmy i'm still  uncomfortable because i  never got an answer why  the guy completely blew me  off and that's what i  got out of yesterday now  i'm like okay now i  understand why it blew  me off i don't really i  don't um agree with him  yeah you know but that's  how he deals with things  and and we're all  different you know i'll  say that much but guess  what i'm fine with it now 
[03:54:30]  because at least i got an  answer you know and i  also learned that you  know being uh dice's  friend is uh quite  frankly uh exhausting  yes and i don't really  know i don't really think  uh i want to go down  that road again you know  but that doesn't mean uh  we can't do good radio  down the road but we'll  see we're gonna have an  open mind if this doesn't  mean that dice is gonna  start doing our show  again well i got a quick  question because what i  said before is you know  you said you're gonna  dice do show anyway but  if dice is going to be  doing the show in front of 
[03:55:00]  a bunch of all and a  fans was he going to be  booed out of the building  we don't know that's why  i this is how this started  i didn't want them to boo  and i don't think they  would boo arty i hope  they know better because  i've done fucking  howard crowds uh and  they're always respectful  and great like that  fucking benefit i did for  jerry red wilson with  gray they were a lot more  howard fans because i  think that they he  promoted more uh than  than i did i hardly  promoted at all right so  i think arty's name was  attached to that from day  one we had a couple i  was honestly i think we  mentioned it twice maybe  three times in passing we  didn't really do much 
[03:55:30]  time on that and we  the howard guy they're  all howard guys and we  should have because it's a  it's a great uh great  call they're all serious  and howard guys and you  know what that crowd was  fucking great to me so  i'm not really worried  about arty i didn't want  to see the crowd it was  more for the one or two  people that might act up  because the taping is  going to go well dude i  have no doubt he's going  to kill on a taping i  honestly don't i think all  the comics are going to  do well a taping has a  great vibe to it but then  i saw this thing of like  it when i saw that opa's  really i i didn't realize  that fucking opa's gonna  be bothered by something  and i was really glad he 
[03:56:00]  told me and we we walked  home and we had a real  heart to heart well i  told jimmy i go jimmy  i'm very uncomfortable  with uh with uh the fact  that you know dice is  doing your show because  for the simple reason i  never got an answer and  there's no closure to all  that bullshit that went on  i and as i said here i  don't there's there's  sort of closure now  whatever um what the  what the fuck this stupid  allergy so uh so i told  jimmy that and and jimmy  took it upon himself to do  something about it and we  talked all the way home and 
[03:56:30]  you know what i would never  have just mentioned it on  the show casually like  hey just behave like i  didn't remember all the  shit that had gone on my  girlfriend and i have had  major problems i'm in  depression i've been  talking whatever the fuck  i'm in sexual therapy  who gives a shit my head  has not been in the right  place and i'm like oh my  god as we're walking  home i actually said i was  sorry to open like i  actually would have talked  about uh this to you i  would have discussed this  with you and so how do you  want to because i hadn't  remembered all that stuff i  forgot how nasty some of  that stuff was and believe 
[03:57:00]  me oh and a fired back  really nasty too i  fucking forgot about how  nasty it got so i talked  to him all the way home  about it i laugh at the  people they go uh you  should have went through  the laundry list of things  he did i'm like uh i  trust me i i know i did  just fine uh fighting back  yeah and i remember some  of the things i said and  i was pretty impressed with  myself i think the hit  backs it's funny because  pete the agent i was like  you know because andrew  said a lot of nasty shit  he's like you kidding  those guys fucking hammered  him back i'm like oh yeah  they did right really  dice actually made me laugh  yesterday when we sort of 
[03:57:30]  brought that up and he  goes well what was i  supposed to say i was  mad at you guys you know  yell and scream how great  you guys are yeah so what  you're doing by that is  don't try that fucking  split thing like i'm doing  something without regards  to the show because that's  exactly what that is that's  exactly what you're saying  when you do that well i  just thought that maybe  your jim norton's i thought  maybe your special would be  you know something else  that's not taped tacked on  to the show like the fact  that i'm fucking like the  fact that everything i've 
[03:58:00]  done in my career since  i've been with opie and  anthony i've mentioned opie  and anthony or i'm fucking  credited that what the fuck  are you talking about and  every audience i do i fought  to have my hbo special shot  in dc so it would be on a  fans that hadn't seen me in  a while i wanted this done  here why do you think  they're doing this in  fucking jersey it's hbo i  don't really shoot in jersey  you know what jimmy you  don't have to explain that  shit but i'm anyone out  there thinking that way  this is not about him not  liking dice that's  acceptable there's been so  many times like uh where  jimmy's like okay you  guys are gonna sit here  and uh you're gonna stand  up i want to i want to 
[03:58:30]  acknowledge you guys and  i said to jimmy you don't  have to do that you don't  i mean i think it's awesome  that you did but a few  times like jimmy you know  people get it you don't  have to do that anymore  and then when jimmy was at  caroline's last month i went  to one of the shows and and  he didn't uh uh say that i  was in the audience yeah it  was a rowdy friday late  show and he was obsessing  about it at the show i'm  like dude it's it's okay i  everyone knows the  connection now it's all  good don't worry about it  but i like to do that  because it's not even to 
[03:59:00]  be corny it's because as a  comic i realized the  fucking audience i get is  from this show 80 90 of  my audience hardcore fans  from the opian anthony  show they love it when the  guys come out and it's  also a way it's like it  sounds stupid but i get a  lot of accolades from fans  live because i'm on stage  right it's like you guys  don't get that it's like  when you're in the audience  and they can clap for you  it may sound corny but it's  fucking i like it it's  it's almost like i don't  know i've never separated  myself like that so when  you're saying shit like  that it's questioning my  fucking mode and it makes  me want to fucking spit in 
[03:59:30]  your face all the other  stuff you said i got no  problem with it you i don't  agree with it but you're  you know you trash dice  that's fine you don't want  them on the show that's  fine but when you're  questioning my motives like  that you can't makes me  hate your fucking guts i  didn't mean to question  that doesn't matter that's  that's exactly what you  were doing so just don't  ever fucking speak to me  again  by flay um yeah i guess  we probably should have  explained a little more  because uh it was just  more of a coincidence how  everything was was  developing and i just i 
[04:00:00]  just uh point out to you  that you might have a  situation yeah and that  you you just should at  least be aware of that  because you did you do  have an unbelievable  opportunity and i and  then it and then it  escalated to dice wants to  come in by himself without  the shtick without his  people there's going to be  no intimidation with his  guys around because you  know he's got his posse  that that makes it very  intimidating for him to  be in the studio and i  wasn't i wasn't blown away  by him yesterday but i got  my i got my answer yeah  um you know and and now i 
[04:00:30]  at least know where his  head was at i don't agree  with it still you know and  i told him that off air and  and he said all right my  last interaction with him  and this is again i said i  admit it i was so stupid  to not have thought like do  you think i would just put  myself in a position to be  where everything is going to  be fucking awkward why  would i do that like for  anybody out there who  thinks like i didn't care  like why the fuck would i  do that my last interaction  with him was at the gene  simmons roast when he  walked in i knew he was  going to be there and he  saw me on the dais in front  of the whole audience and  he goes oh jim norton right  and he i came up and he 
[04:01:00]  hugged me on stage it was  like that was my last  memory of him um and then  as opie's going over the  stuff as we're walking i'm  like oh my god it did get  really fucking nasty at one  point i had i had forgotten  how nasty it got like i knew  it was like yeah there was  some tension but i really did  forget the individual i'm  not gonna lie and and people  are kind of mad at me  because i didn't play uh  the audio of howard  completely uh saying what  he did about my father i'm  like look dude it wasn't a  bit yesterday i'm not i can't  i cannot emotionally listen  to that audio simple as that  so i told him look you know 
[04:01:30]  if if you were truly part of  that you know then you  shouldn't even be in front of  in front of my face right  now and he swears that he  wasn't i don't know i don't  know you know i don't know  people have said that he  was and a lot of people  have said that he did uh  deflect when that whole  thing was going down but i  wasn't going to play that on  the fucking show well i've  heard the audio i heard when  he said it um i know the  guy and i knew exactly what  he did when he did it right  my first instinct was he  bounced i was trying to get  him all riled up he just 
[04:02:00]  walked away from it and went  into uh and put it back on  you right it's like and i  know the guy well enough to  know that's the way he hits he  doesn't hit like that right i'm  not saying certain comedians  wouldn't have but that's  just not the way he hits  and then people still  writing it it's like no  dude right i heard it it's  not what happened yeah so  whatever man i mean people  who disagree with all that  i'm fine with that i'm only  annoyed and maybe other  people wrote that i really i  only really read a couple of  them that one little  paragraph he wrote is what  i'm talking about i i i  surprised myself yesterday 
[04:02:30]  because i i just it was it  was what it was yeah i thought  i was gonna like go nuts or  react or or maybe it ends  with like this huge emotional  hug it was just there to be  honest with you and i'm just  being honest dude it was just  there a lot of times that's the  way it is i mean when friends  have falling out and nasty shit  has been said and then and  then you talk sometimes it is  okay we talked let's see what  happens next right that's a lot  of times the way things rebuild  the movies have it one or two 
[04:03:00]  ways it's a big head-to-head or  it's like you said the emotional  everyone's crying instead it  was probably awkward for him  too right and it was like  everybody kind of talks feel  each other out it felt a little  weird yeah um and then we  stood outside the building for a  minute or two and it was some  of this uh you know what are you  guys doing now and i don't know  what are you doing uh and then  it was like no exchanging of  numbers because we all well me  and him i should be yeah i'll talk  for myself we both have different 
[04:03:30]  cell phone numbers now and all  that and it was just like all  right well you know i i said  all right good luck tomorrow  i'm sure you'll do great it was  good seeing you and walked off  with jimmy and that's that's uh  there was no hollywood ending  there is i guess what i'm trying  to say you know some things are  left open-ended and that's fine it  doesn't have to be hollywood  ending it can be we i mean dice  knows i mean we shared some really  good moments over the years really  good late night phone calls and  like he said you know he said i i  made it sound like he was  calling me you know i i was 
[04:04:00]  calling him just as much and when  i was in la i did a lot of time in  la when we were off the air i made  sure i checked in with him and we  had some uh very very good times  and i guess that's i'm extremely  disappointed how it all um ended  you know but uh that's life i guess  right yeah but um because people  just heard different things  yesterday that's why it's so hard  to go to the message boards because  it's like you know you guys don't  even like listen sometimes and then  like have all these crazy opinions 
[04:04:30]  it's like did you even listen to  the the hour some people saying we  were kissing his ass and and  everything is great now and it was  just like what did you hear what do  you want like what did you actually  did you hear what was going on and  just at least do that listen a little  closer before you come up with these  crazy you know reasons why things are  going down is there anyone on the  phones who didn't agree because we  have some calls and if there is put  them through i'm fine with that i  mean again this is not about making  everybody feel a certain way but  there was other people too who i 
[04:05:00]  knew were probably happy that he  came back and hopefully whatever  uh i'll just go right down the line  i don't need to screen these uh jd in  atlanta jd yeah i just wanted to say  i really thought that uh yesterday was  brilliant i mean for the xm listeners  i think bringing in new people i know  he's old to you guys but to uh um i  think if you guys can push away your  differences i think it'd be great for  the show and i agree with you and i but  i like the fact that hope is honest  man it's it it is what it is um it's 
[04:05:30]  like sometimes you have a certain  amount of closure and then it's like  let's let's see what goes from here i  mean people have had a lot worse  fallings out than that um and if  things are different because to me in  all honesty sitting with him in the  brooklyn diner for the time we did  right he didn't seem he's still dice  but there was something a little bit  different about him um and i know a  lot of stuff that was that has  happened i guess that he didn't  go into on the air right i saw i saw  some uh a little yeah he was a  little different there was something  different about him uh and i'm not  saying he was bad but whatever but 
[04:06:00]  maybe he's through the other side of  the divorce and starting to find his  way again uh but him and him and his  wife were very close for a very long  time and it got nasty i don't know the  details because no one ever told me i  just know it got very vicious there's  two different things going on here i  don't think our friendship will ever  be the same but uh we do we do great  radio with people that we're not  friends with when when these mics go  off that that there was definitely  two things going on there yesterday  and you got to trust people  emotionally to be really good  friends and you know what if so if  you have shit like that it's almost  you're almost a fool to immediately 
[04:06:30]  trust somebody again because it's  the human nature it's like you can't  just immediately go okay and i don't  mean trust somebody like they're not  lying but i mean it's corny but look  when we're friends we trust each other  they're not going to fucking destroy  us or hurt us it's kind of hard to do  that immediately you're almost a fool  if you do it immediately right very  good uh let's go to joe on long  joe joe hey joe hey as someone  that's been through both having my  dad die suddenly and going through a  divorce with children you guys had  like the perfect storm opi's going 
[04:07:00]  through what he's going through dice  is going through he's going through  you lash out at your closest of  friends for no reason whatsoever and  the two of you together just collided  at the worst time and it was more  it was more i think that for it was  more andrew hitting opi uh to start  with believe you hit back but i think  it was more that and i but i really do  think like the guy's not that much  because he never it really was i really  believe that that little thing with 
[04:07:30]  max he thought probably he got a little  annoyed the next day or whatever and  then it was gone and then all of a  sudden it came back out and the only  example i can give you and this is a  shitty example is i found out when i  was in fifth grade the first girl i ever  loved was kissing this guy named andrew  in the basement i found out when i was  a freshman in high school years later  and the rage that came i didn't express  it to him because we were children and  now here i am in high school i just got  so fucking angry right years later than 
[04:08:00]  that completely irrational but it's like  sometimes the way you process i kind of  knew at the time what they were doing  but i was too embarrassed and humiliated  to say anything it's really weird how  fucking anger works right and what when  you're going i'm sorry no go ahead  when you're going through a divorce  your best friend of 15 years could come  up to you and say hello and you'd be  like hello right what are you fucking  saying hello for right you know what  the fuck i'm going through he won't  what she's trying to do to me yeah i'm  losing half my pet and he's like dude  i was just saying hello and you will 
[04:08:30]  blow friendships for no reason dude  he changed his whole life i mean me and  andrew were very close uh he was close to  his agents especially with children close  to opian anthony close to his wife everything  changed for him and now it just seems like  things have settled down and maybe uh they're  more normal i i don't know but do it and  anyone gets questioning the motives the  beautiful thing is dude he had a reality  show he needed to make that work and he  didn't come on then he's not gonna  fucking i know the guy well enough to  know that he's not gonna fucking sell 
[04:09:00]  himself out or what he sees is selling  himself out for a 10 minute spot in front  of an audience on a tv taping when he  didn't do it for his reality show and  people have to realize that he didn't  try to come in for he was doing massive  press for the reality show that meant  the world to him because i was in the uh  i listened to the planning stages of  that whole thing i will i sat in his uh  la apartment that that he had when uh  you know he was going through the  separation whatever and honestly we  probably watched six hours straight of 
[04:09:30]  his videotapes he had like boxes and  boxes of tapes that go back i don't  know 10 years and he's like just  picking oh well you got to check out  this moment with wheels and all this  with kenny and it was just i mean just  endless and it was interesting and he  was talking about how he you know the  concept for the reality show and stuff  and uh yeah if he was gonna do it for  for for his career he would have  certainly like tried to make good with  us uh when that was all going down  because that was a biggie for him or  to plug major gigs like westbury which  he does it's almost like this is 
[04:10:00]  literally honest to god guys the  headliners on these shows it's a  half-hour show you're seeing two  half-hour episodes tonight there's  myself a few comedians and andrew  doing 10 and on the late show it's  either uh billy or patrice doing 10  that's all the headliner does right  so it's like to not plug your own  reality show which everything is  riding on and then to do what you  would see is selling yourself out to  plug it it doesn't make fucking sense  and i know the guy well enough to  know that right or wrong he's not  gonna do something that he's not  feeling on any level yeah um and i 
[04:10:30]  don't think either side really  budge it was just like no he  explained where he was coming from  i explained where i was coming from  i totally get why he was pissed  because like i'm really tight with  family and if someone's going after  me and making me look stupid in front  of one of my brother i don't have kids  your girl whatever well the girl  thing hello you know i'm yeah i'm i'm  fighting like a fucking pit bull about  that trust me but i could totally  understand where he's coming from with  that and i had tunnel vision i was so  fucking pissed that man cow was trying 
[04:11:00]  to blow up our spot because we had  this exciting thing going on with dice  i was i i uh directed all my anger  toward dice like what the fuck you  can't let man cow do this and i  remember it like it was yesterday  screaming yelling and max was in new  york with his with his pop you know he  was telling him wow marston square  garden i get a chance to do this again  this is exciting you get to check out  me doing media and i'm making his  father look like it like it like an  idiot yeah i totally get it now you  know because i've grown as a person  but what i don't get is the fact that  he should have like smashed me right 
[04:11:30]  away and absolutely not just on the  air off the air you know discuss like  dude what the fuck i i don't think i  could be friends with you if you if  this is how you're gonna treat me in  front of my own kid yep he should have  told me that he should have told me why  i mean again maybe he was never good  at that stuff some people we all have  a flaws and some people are just  fucking suppressors man they push stuff  down don't even realize it's there and  it comes out like ridiculously but  that's what misdirected anger is i  mean it comes out i believe me i  would say 80 percent of what was said  about anybody was probably directed 
[04:12:00]  it's like what what what fucking  as a stupid example alec baldwin  calling his kid a selfish pig he was  talking to his ex-wife right but i  mean it's like if that was a much  closer relationship than this of course  thing but that's what misdirected  anger is and uh i guess other people  i don't know how they feel but any any  opinions are valid just flee my  problem with you is simply that not  nothing else you said and to lighten  the mood uh when we were walking home  jimmy and i both commented like god  we're turning into girls we're just  discussing this like human beings 
[04:12:30]  instead of like the old days where we'd  be in in each other's faces like irish  brothers just like getting ready to  beat the shit out of each other but it's  almost like we we say enough horrible  things on the show it's like we don't  have to prove ourselves as far as being  shocking or saying shitty things right i  like to handle things honestly and  truthfully because i'm a fucking i'm a  rage addict and i can't live like that  i'm having a fucking stroke right i can't  do it i'll be dead before i'm 50 the  way i drive the way i fucking react i'm  terrible yeah i've been working on it  myself i get it totally get it uh a 
[04:13:00]  couple more how much time before they  shut us off there fan probably about 15  uh tony in elana what's up hey good  morning hey listen yesterday was the  most uncomfortable radio i've ever heard  and i loved it oh good i mean i mean  because i will be honest with you i've  only started with the uh with the xm day  since you started at xm and uh you guys  uh had some links to some of your old  shows and i used to hear what uh dice  did like going down to uh uh ground zero 
[04:13:30]  and everything else and some of the  quiet moments that he was talking about  where you would uh be quiet and let them  just ramble on and uh you know like you  said i've seen a change in europe since  the beginning and uh and i'd like to go  ahead and see more of it i mean i agree  with jimmy you know yesterday was  yesterday today today let's work our  differences and again when you and when  you were friends for so long i mean you  come to a change you came to see what  he was about and uh where he was coming  from so i still think it's kind of nuts 
[04:14:00]  but then again you can't be a comedian  and be sane i there were many times  yesterday i'm like wow this could get  really ugly and then don't i think the  only no i was gonna make a joke i  shouldn't uh but kenny was here because  i'm thinking to myself god if it gets  ugly kenny's gonna be really confused  talk about being fried his hair's  already fried can you imagine what's  gonna happen to his brain i'm gonna i'm  gonna uh i don't know i'm gonna it's  gonna sound kind of like douchey but  whatever i mean whatever i mean you got  me in uh in a in a in a zone right now 
[04:14:30]  but um my my dad loved uh our show he's  one of our biggest fans and uh he  actually he loved what i did on the show  the anger and the over the top and just  overreacting to everything and and he  and he sat me down and he goes i like  all that but why don't you allow uh you  know another part of your personality to  to shine on the radio and i was like ah  damn that this is how i'm doing it blah  blah blah and then he passed and it's i  feel almost like i'm doing it for him  like because i'm like you know what i 
[04:15:00]  think he might have had something there  so i i i i i i'm i'm allowing this part  of my personality to come out you know  on the air here and there you know so  because a lot of people just expected  me to be the guy that oh oh is he gonna  break something today oh who's he gonna  punch in the face now you know how many  people i've punched in the face live on  the radio it's disgusting at this point  so uh let's go to gabe in new york gabe  what's up hey guys um yesterday's segment 
[04:15:30]  was quite interesting because it's  something that radio has been lacking for  a while it's it was real like i think  people on message boards like there's  so many bits and there's so much fake  shit that they didn't know how to even  respond to yesterday because it was very  real and it wasn't even it wasn't supposed  to be funny it was just you know which  was what was aired out there you know  yeah and it's it's almost like like and  again they're right and some of them are  really mad at dice and that's a valid  point that's cool to be mad i'm not  saying that the message boards should be  shot it's only like they so completely 
[04:16:00]  questioned every motive he had and  it's almost like i guess i would too if  i was out there but it's like i guess  knowing all parties involved as well as  i know all parties involved knowing what  a stubborn lunatic he is he doesn't do  anything he doesn't want to do and  again if it was to completely be a whore  it would have been for the reality show  which was monumentally bigger for him  than this 10 minute spot is uh jimmy  your ocd's uh kicking in why then people  get it okay they really do all right  you're probably right i do a little ocd  though i that's a curse i get from my 
[04:16:30]  dad who i love but he over explains  things so my apologies i really do my  father does that my father would be like  that's a good cup of coffee like i enjoy  i get it dad they get it maybe in  fairness they didn't completely get that  yesterday because we didn't like explain  all the behind the scenes shit that was  going on but i mean but you think people  get it and then all of a sudden you read  stuff you're like oh my god what were you  listening to i i just read them i read  the message boards less and less  because it's just you can't you can't  keep up with just the nonsense it just  it gets frustrating it's like especially 
[04:17:00]  when you read stuff and you go this guy  wasn't even listening to the same  fucking show yeah those silly geese uh  let's go to bill in minnesota bill  hey what's happening hey little jimmy  you fucking rock brother thank you  buddy yesterday just showed how fucking  fucked up and flawed dice is just like  the rest of us sure and you fucking  gave him a chance brother you didn't  forget that he fucking helped you out  you fucking rock jimmy but you know  don't blame shit on your dad jim  no no i'm saying the over explaining  i love my dad but he over explains and 
[04:17:30]  if my father was here he'd say jim's  not blaming me he's just pointing out  you know my dad would over explain yeah  let's uh all right a speed round then  we got to get out of here chad long  allen what's up jimmy actually has to  go to the taping in the next hour uh  chad yeah how you doing it's john  all right john what's up yeah look  i've been with you guys since uh you  signed on with uh xm you have your  highs and lows and then the other thing  is i understand as a listener that you  know part of the masses with a capital  a i don't need to dissect every part of  the show and and overanalyze it you 
[04:18:00]  know you what you had is all about good  radio dice coming back even the cringe  part of it it's still good radio in the  thing ahead of this it'll make for  better radio and i'll tell you i've been  with you since you signed on and that  you'd like in hot pod where you had that  meet and greet i've already signed  every time upgraded my radios i love the  show would never give it away and when  you were off the air from any w that  was like the darkest time of my life  because during work i had nothing to  listen to thank you man all right so  man keep it going i love it thanks 
[04:18:30]  buddy  what we this ain't gonna make the  replay a lot of it why we gotta we  gotta figure out what to cut then  oh my god you could you could cut uh  the 200 times i sneezed during the show  today or make let me only reiterate a  point eight times yeah and let jimmy  just make his point one  you know yesterday was good for me too  because a lot of people that end up  like having a problem with me which i  and it's good to just get answers  because and and then you realize that a 
[04:19:00]  lot of these people that have problems  with you it's just their reactions are  weird it's just ridiculous yes you know  ridiculous uh let's go to mark uh the  trucker mark marky yeah what's up  buddy i just uh honest honest answer  um she looked you sounded like you  were having a little bit of fun jabbing  at dice uh here and there if he would  have handed you the phone would you  have smashed it  uh yes yes absolutely okay and then i 
[04:19:30]  would have had to buy him i would have  had to buy a new phone immediately but  yes i think that would have been a  pretty good moment i absolutely good in  the world jimmy fuck i mean if i mean  that's what my intention was but then he  hands over the phone and then what you  know yeah i think i would have went  through with it yeah thanks mark take  care man uh dylan jay from jersey opi  you're a hypocrite you guys make fun of  cancer and burn victims and say shit to  people about oh a little and then uh he  writes oh a little too close to home and  capital letters huh when they complain 
[04:20:00]  and now the shit about your dad and  you're acting just like the callers you  bitch opi well here's what that guy  misses there you go buddy no one ever it  it was like when you're you're saying  when you're friends with somebody and  you and it's perceived that you  publicly would you know there's a  difference between that no one said  that a death or a car action is off  limits but it's like when you think  that somebody you know has attacked  something like that of course it's  gonna bother you you know come on dude  no one is saying that content is off  limits right we do make fun of 
[04:20:30]  everything but of course we do uh  maybe we'll explain another day because  you don't i know i've over explained  eight things already sorry because you  don't really understand what the what  the show really is about i guess good  job you're growing everything was  perfect uh why is family even yeah we  slipped on that one yesterday oh no  really dice uh got me to a place i'm  admitting when i'm getting married oh by  the way for the people out there uh now  i gotta change my wedding day because  i'm uh i'm extremely private in my uh my  personal life and uh that that has been 
[04:21:00]  changed already because because out of  nowhere i'm telling them when i'm  getting married i'm like fucking home  number half so now i have to change the  wedding day which is a complete and  major fucking problem and hassle but  but we will do that and then i also  said that than was leaving and we were  trying to like have that as a little  like cliffhanger to the end of the  month and that slipped out yesterday but  than is uh is going to be leaving the  show to pursue uh comedy full-time and i  i gave him my uh blessing we had a nice  talk on the sidewalk i'm like dude i  think it's the best move for you i 
[04:21:30]  really do you got to be brave enough  to know when to leave a really really  good situation to to try to make  yourself better and a lot of the guys  that have worked for us in the past  they they never understood that lesson  so then when things do go bad then  they then they uh look at me and other  people on this show and attack which  just amazes me what you should do is  realize there's an amazing opportunity  but you got to be brave enough to know  when it's time to move on and and go for  the next thing to make yourself a better  person whether personally or or career 
[04:22:00]  wise and that's what than's doing and i  think it's i think it's terrific and i  think uh they'll still do the same uh the  fan and sam show and uh and then will  always be you know a part of this show  when he can simple as that cool that's  well but now that was the setup so now  you should uh i don't have anything  prepared uh what well i'm still i feel  weird because i still have a couple days  left so no i know it's this isn't the  big goodbye but i i think it's a great  move for him thank you and you know i'm  glad you guys had my back and uh yeah 
[04:22:30]  i'll i'll say something i guess when  it's actually my last day just to lose  these contributions unbelievable hopefully  we will be able to continue i'll be  i'm gonna miss the laugh in the  background i love fan the laugh in the  background was a lot of people more  people uh like that than you realize when  you when you when you hear get a good  laugh out of fan you know you did oh  and get a good laugh out of danny any  of these fucking animals when you get a  good laugh out of them you know like it  was funny because they've just jaded  pricks all of them or you just or you  just ate your balls horrifically that  makes me laugh real
