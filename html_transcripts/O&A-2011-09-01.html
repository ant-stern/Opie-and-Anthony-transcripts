<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was a chaotic and often vulgar affair, encompassing a wide range of topics and featuring numerous guests and callers.  The show began with a listener-requested “Worst Of” segment hosted by Mark Maron, focusing on a reconciliation between Opie and Anthony and Andrew Dice Clay.  Dice Clay detailed his anger stemming from perceived slights by Opie and Anthony, a previous guest ("Man Cow"), and the handling of his father's death.  The conversation involved extensive back-and-forth, covering past disagreements, hurt feelings, and references to Jimmy Kimmel, Howard Stern, and Kenny (an associate of both Dice Clay and Opie & Anthony).  Humorous moments included Dice Clay's comedic delivery and interactions with the hosts.

The show then continued with more conversation between Opie, Anthony, and Dice Clay, centered around Dice Clay's falling out with Kenny, stemming from Kenny's perceived inappropriate contact with Dice Clay's ex-wife. This discussion touched upon Kenny’s subsequent public scandal and Dice Clay's frustration with Kenny's handling of it.  Dice Clay shared anecdotes about a reality TV star and other personal experiences, including details about his relationships and children.  The conversation involved explicit language and shifted to lighter topics, including Dice Clay's new girlfriend (a traffic reporter), and humorous anecdotes about sweatshirt shopping and restaurant encounters.  Don, Jim, and Mike Cole were also mentioned.  Listener "Wax from New Jersey" and Mark Maron were referenced in relation to show segments.  Dice Clay even showed a picture of his girlfriend on the show monitor.

A subsequent segment featured a rambling conversation with Jim Norton, Patrice O'Neal, and Bob Kelly. This involved a sexually explicit anecdote, followed by discussions of Jim Norton's relationship with Opie, past conflicts, and Howard Stern’s “dead dad” jokes.  Dice Clay recounted elaborate pranks played on his agent and a friend. Jim Norton expressed his anger about past incidents, and Opie briefly discussed his upcoming marriage and anxieties.  The segment included vulgarity, humorous banter, and concluded with the playing of an embarrassing 1994 demo tape of Opie and Anthony’s early work.

The show then devolved into a chaotic and profane segment with unnamed co-hosts and numerous callers.  This featured Sally, a caller whose enthusiastic calls led to multiple hang-ups.  A car crash outside the studio was reported.  The hosts made jokes about the mental stability of various celebrities (Gabe Kaplan, Henry Fonda, George Burns, Sam Kinison). An angry phone call from a listener's boss, upset about the listener's participation in a Pizza DeLuso promotion, was a major focus.  The hosts also discussed a listener’s concern about Opie’s voice sounding like Susan Waldman.  There was a running gag about the listener’s boss’s anger and potential retaliation. The promotion itself involved a listener repeating the business name for a free pizza, and led to numerous other calls. The hosts engaged in physical comedy bits and personal attacks.  A song parody about O.J. Simpson was played, followed by a listener-requested song. The show mentioned upcoming segments, including a listener request show with Mark Maron and a deaf karaoke performance.

The "deaf karaoke" segment, initially planned as a contest involving marshmallows and numbed tongues (with a dentist consulted), was ultimately abandoned.  The conversation shifted to Karen Meyer, a deaf news reporter, and her "Crip Slam Sundays" event.  Listener calls suggested songs for the abandoned contest.  A later segment involved Bobby Kelly, Pat from Monaki, and a prank where Pat exposed his anus while Kelly was reading a voicemail, resulting in Kelly vomiting.  Mark Maron was again mentioned as hosting the listener request show.  The show concluded abruptly with the hosts thanking the audience.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, banana phone.  Um, normally, these two tools decide what you'll be hearing on the worst of opiate anything.  Hey, this is Sam, and this is E-Rock.  Yeah!  Dickheads.  However, you've called, emailed, tweeted, fed back, and screamed that you could do a much better job of selecting bits than they can.  So now, not so much as a thank you for years of faithful support, but more to stifle your bitching and complaining. 
[00:00:30]  We're giving you the opportunity to pick your favorite moments from the show.  Uh, I need to hear, I gotta hear, so if you guys can play that again, that would be great.  I love that damn thing. That's what got me hooked on you guys.  Opie and Anthony present the All Requests Worst Of Show.  Call 877-4-WORST-OF and tell us what you want to hear.  And remember, if it sucks, it's your own damn fault.  Hey folks, it's Mark Maron, and I'm sort of hosting this listener request show for O&A. 
[00:01:00]  Why? I don't fucking know.  Uh, they're not paying me.  Oh wait, I know.  It's to plug my podcast.  It's, uh, WTF with Mark Maron.  It's available on iTunes and at WTFpod.com.  Uh, you can also get my stand-up dates here, so you can see if I'm in your neighborhood or your town or your state.  However far you want to drive, man.  It's up to you.  But I'm here because O&A liked me and wanted to include me somehow, and since I'm not on the virus, uh, this is the only way we can do it. 
[00:01:30]  Uh, because WTF is not on there yet, uh, but it is available at iTunes and at WTFpod.com.  Did I mention that?  Well, there, I just did it again.  All right, so what happens here is I don't have to do that much, which is great.  You're already calling 877-4-WORST-OV, that's 877-496-7786, and requesting the Opie and Anthony material you want to hear.  Uh, then the computer sorts it out and then plays it.  That being said, let's see how many requests we have today and get this shit started.  Today's listener request voicemail has four new messages.

[00:06:00]  Seriously?  Yeah  You know, Norton  I gotta stop by these proceedings  By saying, you know  No matter what goes on up here  Right  Good or bad  Norton's to blame  Yeah  You know what I mean?  Because we had a nice talk yesterday afternoon  And he said, you need to stop by  And you were man enough to stop by  Which I think is really, really cool, actually  I don't even know where to begin, to be honest with you  Well, did you just get here? 
[00:06:30]  Yeah  How many minutes ago?  Like, ten minutes ago  Oh, okay  Yeah  No, we figured it would be better  We did the other thing  We did the other thing  But we figured it would be  We did the other thing there  And then we come here for this thing  We figured it would be better over here  Because we could go long form  Instead of like  Oh, well, we're having a moment here  But we gotta  It is cool up there  It is relaxed  We gotta fit the commercials in  What happened was  Jimmy got you for the HBO show he's doing  Yeah  Very exciting, by the way  And  Down and dirty  And finally  Sure  Yesterday on the way home  I talked to Jimmy  I'm like  That was the only part that bothered me, though 
[00:07:00]  What?  You know that, Anthony  The filth part of the HBO show  Oh, yeah  They're making me do some of the off-color stuff  Oh, really?  Yeah  That bothers you?  I gotta go back to that  Yeah, he tried a clean set  It wasn't very good  Oh, shit  No, that's an exciting concept, though  Don't you think?  I mean, before we talk about anything  Yeah  Like, what?  Doing clean sets?  No  The whole idea of the show  Yeah  Hell yeah 
[00:07:30]  Do you know about it?  I've heard something about it  All right  You know, this is why I don't talk to you  It's one of Jimmy's things  No, Eddie, if you're not involved in it, you don't care  Anthony's  That's what it is with him always  I'm in a whole new world right now  I know  You've been through it, I know  Oh  Yeah  Single now, guys  So, you know  You'll have to talk about it  Now it's just  Oh, I talk about everything  Oh, really?  Yeah, no, no  Now I'm single, single  I'm single from that  Your girlfriend  Oh, you mean you went through another one  Yeah, not a marriage or anything  No 
[00:08:00]  Never do that twice  Everybody does that  Yeah  So I was going out with that girl for, you know  You met her  You become bulletproof on those things  Eight years  After a while  Yeah  You know what I mean?  Yep  I mean, I don't know about you  But if I break up with somebody at nine  I don't mind going with somebody by nine, ten  It's just what I've become  I don't even understand it myself  Yeah, there's no  You know, my ex-girlfriends  They go, how can you go with somebody else  You know, so quickly  I go, because we're done over here  Yeah  What am I waiting for? 
[00:08:30]  You know, because, you know  Women have the thing  About, like, they go through a whole period of  They don't want to know from guys for a while  Yeah  You know, and then they just start putting it out there again  Like, after a year  What is the wait for?  What does the wait mean, even?  Proving you like the other person?  I think it's a good thing for most girls  Because it keeps the guys from killing them  You know, if the guy finds out  The next day she's out fucking  No, but the guy moves on  The guy moves on  The guy moves on, yeah  Just moving on quick  I mean, really, just fucking quick 
[00:09:00]  Yeah  Girls have the potential to, though  A girl could be out that night  She's just got to be at a bar  And it's over, Johnny  Yeah, but that's  But they have that emotional thing  Just going like  It's a different kind of girl  Yeah  That's not the girl you went with for years  No, no, no  That was, you know, eight years  Long relationship  But now I'm out of that  So now, you know  I'm on the prowl  You hear?  Oh, yeah, yeah  This is  The proceedings 
[00:09:30]  This is more fun than I thought already  Well  The proceedings  Nah, we don't want it to be like that  But  No, I don't want it to be like that  After the show yesterday  I go, Jimmy  You know, I think it's cool  You got dice and all that  But we still, like, have, like, issues  And Jimmy and I  So this is more therapy than anything else  I don't know what it's going to be  But Jimmy and I talked all the way on the way home  Like, you know  You put me in a tough spot  Because, you know, we were all friends back in the day  And then something happened that  To this day 
[00:10:00]  It really makes it sound like a long time ago  Well, dude, I haven't seen you in four years  Easily  Maybe longer  Yeah, but back in the day  Sounds like you were 110  Back in the day  Back in the day is a long time  That's like the 80s  It's like the old mustache beats  Back in the day  Well, when you go from  Being close and having phone conversations every day  To nothing  To nothing  So I go, Jimmy  I said this for Jimmy  I go, look, I'll be all right either way  But if you're doing this HBO show  You know, there's issues with dice  Because it's not going to be fair to Jimmy  Because the fans are going to be a little weirded out 
[00:10:30]  By the whole thing  I'm not saying they would boo or anything  I didn't want to go down that road  And I told Jimmy  And Jimmy knows that  I go, but there might be a weird atmosphere  When you guys are taping this HBO thing  And let's see if we can work something out  And me and Opie talked on the way home  And I was like, you know what?  Because I've been going through something  With my relationship falling apart  I'm like, I really am a dummy  Like, I didn't  I'm like, oh yeah  There was a lot of back and forth  And back and forth  And back and forth  I mean, there was a lot of it  And I'm so stupid  I was like, oh yeah  I forgot about that  I forgot about that 
[00:11:00]  I forgot about the stuff  That was said on both sides  And so Andrew and I  Talked yesterday  And I'm like  Yeah, I didn't take it lightly  What he was saying  Yeah  You know, I mean  I might be, you know  Not very hardcore right now  I believe  I believe, Jimmy  When he said that  You were having some serious moments  Yeah, it was a real nice talk  We spent a few hours together  At the Brooklyn Diner  And it was like  It was nice, man  And I'll be honest  A lot of  This is the fun part  A lot of whatever you said  In retaliation  To whatever I said 
[00:11:30]  Right  I can't really attack you on  Because I didn't hear it  Right  See, that's the beauty  Of not having a radio show  And not being hired anywhere  Right  Because I'm not listening  Yeah  It's that simple  I would hear that  You said things  But I don't have quotes for you  Right  So I lose on that end  Well, I got a million of them  No, I know that  I know that  But so do I  Because you know how I get  I don't know  But the one thing  You know  And I'm not even going to say what it is 
[00:12:00]  What, what?  You know, the one thing  I do want to bring up  That we spoke about  Was something that was said  On Howard Show  But it was not about you  And it wasn't  The only  No, it wasn't something  It's nothing I even  It's not like where I ever go  Which is something  Even Kenny would vouch for  Well, let me  And you know what it is  And I don't even want to say it here  Because I don't do that stuff  That's not who I am  But I do got to bring it up  Because I do have to say one thing  Like, you know  I take my shots  You obviously take your shots 
[00:12:30]  And in a way  I understand the overall picture  In the game  Like when  You know, some of the stuff  Howard says  Of course he's going to say  That type of stuff  Because we say the same shit to him  Right  No, but  Let me just say this  The whole dead dad stuff  Is like  Completely unacceptable  And a lot of people  Felt like you were involved  No, that's not my thing  When Howard was saying  Some crazy shit about  You know what  Number one  If I did say it  My dead dad  If I did say it  I would  You know  I'd probably sit here  And apologize  That I was crazy 
[00:13:00]  And at the moment  A lot of people perceive  That you were like  Right in there  With that whole material  No, I'm just telling you  What they said  Because I know  What I was yelling about  On that show  About you  But that's not where I go  It's not where I ever go  And it's just not  It's just not who I am  I'll say filthy things  You know  I'll attack you personally  But never ever  Do I go there  Right  It's just not who I am  And you would know that  Just from all the conversations  We had through the years  Right 
[00:13:30]  You know so  Well we got the audio clip  We could  You know what  If you wanted to play it  I really don't care  Because  I'm curious to see  How it was now  E-Rock  Did you listen to it  If we play it  It could get weird  Yeah you know what  Don't even play it  And the reason  I don't want you to play it  Is more for you  Than for me  Because that's a subject  It's serious  It's a very  It's a bad one  I know what you went through  You know which is  Not why I was ever angry at you  I mean that was a time  I really wanted to talk to you  I don't know why we didn't talk  I was trying to 
[00:14:00]  But I just can't even imagine  Going through something like that  So I know you had to be just  Somewhere in space  And you know  I would tell Pete  You know  Right  That when  Opie gets a chance  Have him just call me  I just want to  Give my condolences  Why didn't you call me  Personally though  I tried to call you  I didn't have a number  To get you at that time  And I kept telling Pete this  You might have had  My old number  Yeah  Because I was out of that situation  It's just something  I don't make fun of  Let me go back  Hold on 
[00:14:30]  Dice  Let me go back  You can go back  I can set you up a little bit  No I'm not  This is in  Just to set the table  For everybody  When my dad died  The biggest flower display  At the funeral home  Was from Mr. Andrew Dice Clay  It was amazing  It was amazing  I'm not a flower guy  But when  It was like  Holy shit  Look what Dice sent  Amazing  And then  What happened with me  Like you know  I've talked about it  A little bit on the air  But I was completely  Devastated when my dad died  Completely 
[00:15:00]  And you always think  In the back of your head  How you gonna feel  When you lose a parent  You just  You can't prepare for it  Is all I'm saying  And I shut completely down  And I stopped talking  To everybody  And somewhere along the line  I think you got insulted  By that  No  That's the only thing  I can figure out  So  It was never  Because like  What went on between us  Has nothing to do with that  That's  All right  Because  That's why I'm not  Doing any jokes  That's why I'm not  Fucking around  Listen  Listen  Listen  The other thing is  My dad died  Three days after we signed 
[00:15:30]  With XM  And we went on a  Promotional tour  Literally two weeks  After my dad died  Started on the radio  Literally a month  A month and a half  And I got word  You wanted to talk to me  Before we went  Back on the air  We just assumed  That we were going to  Pick up where we  Left off  With the great stuff  At NAW  As mad as I might be  About something else  That has nothing  To do with it  So  You know  Being angry at a friend  Just being angry at a friend  That's how it is  Right right  But something like that  And something as 
[00:16:00]  Unexpected as that  I just wanted to get you  On the phone  To you know  Tell you how I felt  And try to you know  Relieve a little pain  For you  Right right  You know  As little as it might be  That's all that was about  I don't get angry  If someone's parent  Passes away  And they're not  Getting on the phone  Right right  That would really make me  The true idiot  As I perform  You know  When I am on stage  Which I'm not  I hear you  I mean there's a lot of  People I still haven't  Called since my dad passed 
[00:16:30]  And you know  Four years later  I think I'm finally  Dealing with all the  Emotions that I went through  When it first happened  To be honest with you  But um  Alright so  Then what happened  Alright this is what  Happened  When  We really got a backup  I got mad  And Kenny  We were all there  When  When I did the garden  In 2000  And I brought my kid up  See that's where  I do draw the line  Right right  When somebody  That I feel I'm friends with  Fucks around with me  In front of my kid  And makes him feel  The way he did that  There on the radio  Over the whole 
[00:17:00]  Little man cow thing  That went on  And I was trying to  Cut it off at the moment  Right  Because I saw the  Look in his face  He was all excited  Right  About coming up  To meet ONA  Right  And he's sitting there  He's got the headphones on  It's all fun and games  And both of you guys  Started in about  Something man cow said  And I'm thinking  Number one  Nobody even knows him  In New York  Like where are we even going  Wait a minute  Yeah yeah  He went on TV  Like on the news  And said he's bringing me  Up at the garden  But you guys didn't end it  And I kept trying to end it  I even kept looking at Kenny  Like I want them to end this 
[00:17:30]  Right right  You know it's also not the  You know on regular  To Bourbon radio  You can't  You know  You can't say things like  You know end this fucking thing  Yeah  You know what I mean  So I was trying to do it  And you stayed on it  You know  And he felt really bad about it  And he was really young  At the time  And even when we left the studio  He was asking me  In his own way  Like what was that all about  I thought you guys are friends  Right  And it's really hard  To explain it to  You know  A 10 year old  At the time 
[00:18:00]  11 year old  Like what  What was going on  You know  And then  You know  Kenny called man cow  Told him don't come to the show  Which  Max also knew  That  You know  Kenny was friends with man cow  Like he doesn't get  That stuff  Especially at that age  I just wanted him  To have a good experience  Well man cow  Was kind of  Blowing up our spot  That's where we're  Hold on  Hold on  I get  Where we were coming from  Is like  We were really excited  And proud  That we were doing this together  It was amazing  Yeah  And everybody knew we were  And if you didn't bring him up  Nobody would have even  Known who it was  Well the problem was  He was doing Fox News 
[00:18:30]  And all of a sudden  He's taking credit  For the fact that  Dice is playing The Garden  For the first time  In how many years  I don't know  At the time  Yeah see  I can't say  He took  But he was on TV  Bragging about it  The Garden happened  1990  February 1990  Fucking  Fucking  He knows  Of course he does  So we felt like  He was blowing up our spot  And of course  As radio guys  We're going to go after  That stuff  I want to make it  Perfectly clear  I didn't go after Max  Personally  But he was  Watching this whole thing  Go on  That's right  And you saw  I was trying to  Cut that off 
[00:19:00]  But the problem  I have with that  Whole thing is  We hung out  Like nothing happened  For probably  A year to two years  That's right  That's what  I'm confused  Because Jimmy told me  That it might be  The time  With Mankow  And The Garden  And Max in studio  I'm like  But that doesn't make sense  When I was out of LA  That's what made me angry  And what  It comes out  Years later  I'm strategic  Really  I'm strategic  You guys were off the air  But this  This ate away at you  Yeah  I told Max  I go  They're going to pay  For what they did 
[00:19:30]  In front of you  That's how I am  I carry this shit  Like luggage  But that don't  And no  When it comes to my kids  That don't make sense though  But it does make sense  It makes sense  That we're hanging out  At the comedy store  If you were hanging  Like best friends  I needed the footage  We did the scene  I know what we did  I did footage for  Never  That's how I am  And I get angry  But we were in your apartment  Like making food  And big  No we weren't  I didn't have an apartment  You had an apartment  Yes  Don't  We sat there for hours  Is that when I first  Moved out of my house  Yeah we sat there 
[00:20:00]  Tiny little places  Yeah so who had time  To think about you  At that time  If I was  But you had the big candy jars  And the big plates  And the big pots  And we hung out for hours  You made me stir fry  And we were watching  Like the videotapes  But all I'm saying  Is like  You never gave a hint  That you were mad at me  I was out there in LA  We did the hike  Up the hill  So how strategic  Is that  That's mental  No  It's diabolical  That's mental though  It's diabolical  I mean if you can't 
[00:20:30]  Discuss  What's following you  On that hike  Let me explain something  To you  As mad as I was  I wasn't mad enough  Not to go on the hike  That's weird man  Yeah  I gotta be honest with you  But did you ever meet  A comic that was normal  Uh  Jimmy  Nope  Sorry  Never  And you're right  Yeah  Not a one  We're all whacked out  You know  Years later  You're gonna get me back  I met Kenny  He was a normal cop  Right  Okay  Is he normal  No  No  Exactly 
[00:21:00]  That's what happens  February 1990  No but I was  Really upset about that  But Dice  That means you got issues  No it means  Because we're  I'm not mad about it  But we were  But we were  Like more than just  We did good  We did great radio together  But we were also  This is what happened  We were also friends  You were calling me  Almost every day  And we had great  Long long conversations  Like why wouldn't you just  You called me back  I called you back  I'm not saying that  You called me too  There was a lot of times  You called me  But that's what friends do 
[00:21:30]  You call each other  Yeah but you don't say that  You said I would call you every day  Alright well whatever  I mean people understand  If we went to therapy  The therapist would want to  Ask me  Why I call every day  And I'd say I don't  We call each other  That's what friends do  It's a two way street  But obviously we were  Never friends  If you're waiting  No we were friends  You're waiting years  To get us back  No it really was  I said that  That's a joke  That would have been  One conversation  You'd tell me what went on  And we would have made that good  I was angry then  Whoever was with me  But then we could have  Discussed it on the radio 
[00:22:00]  When we got back on  We discussed it  The day after it happened  I came up before the garden  And you guys were alone  You know there were no guests  On that day  And you were going on and on  You know  And I know you were all friends  But you know  You got a vouch for it  When you waited in the limo  I said I wanted to go up alone  Say the word  Do me a favor  That's true  He wanted to go up  Yeah because I wanted  To let you know  Because it was you  That didn't stop  That's why I was really angry 
[00:22:30]  Because you know  Anthony and I  Were friendly here  Yeah  You know we like each other  That's why he never paid the price  Because of the impression  You know  No but the point is  Me and you did talk a lot  About a lot of things  Personal things  I'm not going to go into that stuff  On the air  We were friends  That's right  Me and I  We were on air friends  And so the fact that  You were going on and on  After that day with Max  The next day  What did I say the next day  No you were going on  We might not come to the garden  And bring him up 
[00:23:00]  It was like a whole thing  And I said take me over there  I truly don't remember that  Kenny you explain  I believe it happened  Wait a minute  Because he does remember  No it's true  Andrew wanted to go up  All by himself  And speak to you guys  And straighten everything out  And make sure everything  Was good for the garden  Because you know  It was you know  It was a whole thing  Because of my kids  So I wanted to come up here  And I was like  If you want to fight with me  You know  And this is  Sometimes when there's other guests  You can porn it off on them  And I was 
[00:23:30]  I was fuming about it  And I said to you  If you want to fight with me now  Well it's going to be a big mistake  Because I know where I go  I didn't mean fight physically  I meant on the air about this  Because I was fuming  And I don't know how it ended that day  You know  It was more of the threat  Of you guys not coming  And introducing me  You stayed on the man cow thing  But I was still  I was really pissed off  About what you did with my kid  And I told him  I'm going to go straighten this out  That's why I didn't want anybody with me 
[00:24:00]  I understand family and kids  And all that truly  But I don't understand  But you might not  Because  No I do understand  But you might not  I'm going through some  You know personal stuff  That has nothing to do  With the radio show right now  So I totally get it  How you defend  And protect your loved ones  But what I don't understand  Is that you wouldn't just  Pick up the phone  And we work this out  You wait  You wait years  And then also I'm like  Wow Dice fucking hates us  No no  I went after you  I can't remember exactly  When I went after you  I know I did  Well on Howard 
[00:24:30]  Yeah okay  You know kind of a kick in the teeth too  Yeah  You know that  It's hardcore  It's what I do  It's what I'm known to do  It's what you guys are known to do  And whatever you said about me  Saying we're has-beens  Yeah  And saying that  And how I built the other show  I'm a stern wannabe  And all that crap  No no  I know what I said  Right  You know I back up  And I was like  Wow this isn't the guy  I used to talk to on the phone  When you're angry  Don't you say angry things  What should I say  I love those guys 
[00:25:00]  You don't  You can't believe  How funny I think they are  I can't wait to see them again  That's not what you say  When you're pissed off  I understand where it comes from  What you do is you just say  Hurtful nasty things  Right  Which you also retaliate  It's not like you guys  Don't have mouths  And didn't come after me  With shit  And start you know  Blowing my head off  With insults  That's what you do  That's what you do  When you're angry with somebody  But the difference  In the middle of those insults  There were a few compliments  Because we're idiots 
[00:25:30]  We're like  He used to do great radio for us  No but we know that  And I brought that up too  See a lot of people  Are obsessed saying  You did make fun of my dad dying  Yeah but it's not true  And you know it's not true  I'll be honest  And I'll tell you  And I even told you this too  In all honesty  It was  Howard said something  It was in reference to man cow  And when I heard  Andrew's response to that  Was to divert away from it  And I gotta be real honest  And that's something  Regardless of all the horrible shit  Was said  That was something 
[00:26:00]  That I knew at the moment  He was getting away from that  And not going after that  Yeah see that's what  When he fought  Well that's going to be  The hottest audio to find right now  Let me tell you something  People are going to be like  Well I gotta listen to this  Let me tell you something  When you know  When I fought with Howard years ago  I didn't know everything he said about me  Or every war he was having  You live your own life  So when man cow called me  And I was going on Stern  He brought up  That whole thing that he said  About his dad  That what Stern said about his dad  No but that's what 
[00:26:30]  But that's between them  Yeah I know  Okay not between us  So when he said that to me  And Stern brought it up on the air  I don't go there  I do  I divert from that  Because you know  I don't believe in  Making fun of that kind of thing  I never did  You know that  That's just who I am  So whether the fans know it or not  I'm telling them  That's not who I am  I'll rip you to shreds  I'll rip anybody to shreds  And I'll take back 
[00:27:00]  Whatever they give me  If I'm going to go nuts on somebody  I'm going to get it back  You know it's just how that game is played  But when it comes to that kind of thing  Somebody passing away  I do not  And never have my whole life  As a matter of fact  With Howard  One of my first fights  Not even on the air  Was when Ryan White  Years ago  Seven year old kid  Was dying of AIDS  And I don't know how they were doing it  But him and Sam Kennison  Were making fun on the air  And I called him at home 
[00:27:30]  And had a giant fight with him  Going  You know how do you make fun  Of a kid that's dying  You know this kid was a hero  No  That was the reason you stopped doing his show  No that's when  It was not getting a little bad  But I mean  That's what happens  You know we've made up since  We've put out troubles behind us  But I'm just showing how  I never stand  For that kind of thing  I just don't see  Any humor in that  Ever  You know  And that's a definite  If fans don't want to believe it  You know  I'm not coming to their homes  To go  I never did that  You know what I mean 
[00:28:00]  You know  It's just the fact of life  It's not what I do  It's just weird that you wouldn't  Pick up the phone  And discuss this  And the only reason  Because when Jimmy said  The Max thing  I'm like  The Max thing  We had so many great times  After the Max thing  I'm like  This doesn't make sense  Yeah but let me tell you something  I came up here  I told you that day  How it was  You know  And to be quite honest  I thought we were over it then  If you  We weren't over it  Because you didn't fight me on it  And that I was angry about  I would have rather had the fight that day  You know  The day I did the garden 
[00:28:30]  Because there was no satisfaction to it  You know  And yeah  I carried it around  And at a certain time  Whenever it was  I don't even know if you were off the air yet  If you were off the air  Great  What do I care  When we went to Gold's Gym in LA  And we were doing 30 pound curls  Yeah that's right  I remember working out with you  It's not that I didn't like you  I was angry about something  But we could discuss it  You know and sometimes you carry things like  You know I don't know  If Kenny knows why I've been angry at him  Which I don't really know if I could discuss on the air  I'll talk to you off the air 
[00:29:00]  Well this is interesting  Because Kenny really hasn't talked to Dyson  In about four years too  Yeah  Something like that  And then I thought it had something to do  With the fact that we hired Kenny  When he really  Had nothing to do with it  And let me tell you something  I don't know  No  Dad  I really didn't know he was working up here full time  You know  I know he hangs out  You know  Because  You know  I've worked with Don Jameson  I've worked with Florentine  So it is a group  You know  Which is also part of the reason  Norton said  You know what  We all got to be friends  We can't have the fighting 
[00:29:30]  You know  Especially  You know  I'm not looking to bring up America  But I am  Because  You know  We live in  In terrible times right now  And the people  That are supposed to be  Making people laugh  Which is us  Which is  You know  Comics  Radio  Everybody  Is fighting  And we can't  No but you got to get past that  You see what I mean  If you can  You know what  And you said we should be  I'm not sure what a hack is  Wait what did he say  I might have called you that  Because it's insulting  This is more of a  This is more of a compliment 
[00:30:00]  Because although we were pissed off  It kind of made me chuckle  That you thought we were  Where  In Arizona  In the desert  At a hot dog stand  Well you know what  I heard that you opened up a business  That was funny  You were on Kid Chris going  Those guys are  Husbands those guys are over  You're the new king  Or something like that  And then you said  And those guys  I think I passed them once  They have a hot dog stand  In Arizona  A hot dog stand  In the middle of the desert  It hurt but it was kind of funny  Yeah but  Exactly  You see what you just said  It was a hurtful 
[00:30:30]  Vicious thing  Especially if you were off the air  Right  But funny  And that's what I do  I'm a vicious comic  I never claimed to be  A sweetheart  When I'm performing  And as Joe Rogan would call it  Dice me  He calls that  Right right  Which he personally loves  Sure  You know but I was angry about something  Like I said  You can't say nothing  What about the  What about the  What about the  What about the  I mean what is that  What about the picture  Break it down  If that's still bothering you  No it's more of a joke  Break it down  What that word really means 
[00:31:00]  No it's more of a joke  I understand what I do  With the  You know on the  On the air  Yeah so  So it's nothing to talk about  The first request  Worst of show  Hey it's Mark Maron  Host of the WTF podcast  With me Mark Maron  I am hosting this special  That you're listening to  Is this a special  We'll be back with more of your calls  For the Opie and Anthony  Listener request show  In the last segment  A caller requested this  This  This  This is Wax from New Jersey  I want to request  One of my favorite 
[00:31:30]  Worst of moments  And that's the  Triumphant return  Of Andrew Dykes Clay  To the ONA show  So do it a bit  Continuing on with that bit  Here's part two  What about the  The picture me and you  After the garden show  Just me and you  In the empty garden  Yeah  How great is that  It's a beautiful picture  But as we're having that moment  You're mad at me  Because of this  No but I wasn't mad  At that moment  You had to wait to be mad  Like yeah  That was an incredible night  And help me out here  No but why wouldn't  I don't like  Anthony please  You keep interrupting  You really just 
[00:32:00]  You gotta stop already  This is between us  Oh I'm sorry  Alright  People put anger down sometimes  And it comes back  At a weird time  That's what I'm trying  That's the thing  I'm trying to understand  Because all I wanted  For the last few years  Was a reason why  You were mad at me  And you never would give  Well I'm telling you the reason  How it came out  Is how it came out  I never left messages  But I did call  Cell phone numbers  I had for you  I got nothing  No I did not leave messages  Because I was like  Well if he picks up the phone  I'm gonna ask him 
[00:32:30]  At least tell me why  And I would've  Alright  But you didn't tell me why  But I would've  We sabotaged your brother  Wee's interview  And you hung up  Whatever that's fine  But Ant  Do you get this  That was not  You know what  The Wee's thing  Was something that  Norton brought to my attention  And the reason I hung up  Was that was not the time  To do this  On someone else's show  That's why  When Jimmy brought this up  I'm like  Alright I'll come up there  I don't get a problem  You know I never have a problem  Facing anybody  But it's just when it happens 
[00:33:00]  Get Anthony's point of view  Because sometimes  I'm looked at as like  The lunatic  The you know  The hothead  But like I am  But you are a hothead  Dice was  What's your thoughts on this  I see Dice was angry  And he's a complete lunatic  So it took two years  For the anger to come out  Yeah  How come he understands that  You can't get past it  Because I'm like  I'm reactionary  If I'm mad  I can't hold it in for two years  I can't hold it in for 20 seconds  What  No I unload 
[00:33:30]  But also  Constantly  Right  But that's a different story  You let this fester for years  When one phone call  Would have taken care of it  And we could have still done  The radio part of it  No one call  Wasn't going to take care of it  Because number one  You went through something  Terrible  Right  Yeah so what should I do  No you could  You could have called me  Before the terrible thing  Because we were hanging out  You know I don't have  Can you get the dates  No you don't need dates  No exactly  But you do know that  We ran into each other  No I know we hung out  Not a lot  But a couple times  Yeah you came out  To the comedy store 
[00:34:00]  We went to the gym  You were excited  Honestly you were excited  To see me  We did a whole day together  We went to the supermarket  Together  Went to the gym  We did a little shopping  As you were in your silly outfit  You couple of faggots  Holy shit  Not silly enough  No you're rocking  You know  Yeah  You're rocking  Come all that  Come all that  And we went to the Gold's gym  And worked out for maybe seven minutes  And then we went on a hike  And we had all these moments  We sat in your  Yeah but I get that 
[00:34:30]  The temporary apartment  You had to get  Because you know  You were going through a time  Yourself at that point  Yeah  What do you think  That ever ends  That doesn't end  But all I'm saying  Is like  You obviously handle it  Differently  I'm like  I don't  You know  I see it as  A lot of  You know  Opportunities there  To like discuss this  This Max thing  Alright so we're discussing it  Years later  Yeah well I was going  Through something myself  I don't even know you anymore  You know  You know what I mean  Yeah but you do  That doesn't  I didn't see Norton  For a few years 
[00:35:00]  We just started talking  He's the same creep  He always was  It was the same thing  Sitting at the diner  It was the same  We haven't done that in years  Right  It was the exact same thing  What about going to the deli here  How many memories  You want to bring up  How about when we went  Sweatshirt shopping  I remember that  What about when we picked out  Silverware  And we were going to  Move in together  What about discussing  Window treatments  In my old joint  Remember medium or well done  Remember you told  Which way  Oh that's  Remember you told  Bosco 
[00:35:30]  You bet  No  Bosco  Yeah and then I say you bet  Yeah  You bet a Bosco  You  Bosco  You bet  See  But you messed it up  I know  Remember you  It's been a while  I forgot  I totally forgot that  Oh yeah  I love that one  Which way  You bet a Bosco  Bosco  No  You bet  You bet  Yeah  Remember you let  You made Kenny sit in the limo  To walk around  Remember the time  Medium or well done also  Where me and you were walking in the street  Sure 
[00:36:00]  And we were talking about some heavy stuff  Discussing  Yeah  The  Yeah  See  That's heavy  The thing  The thing  Did you  Wait a minute  What  You're  You're not single  I'm  I'm getting married in November  See we haven't talked in a long time  No  To a man too  Which is really odd  You haven't talked in a while  The old one is long gone  And my new girl is amazing  They're all amazing  At this point  Let me just say this 
[00:36:30]  Just to get off of  Remember when we  Remember what  When we  When we  Weeded the garden together  You really getting married again  I never was married  Alright  But you're getting married  Yeah  Alright  I got engaged  Right  You're engaged now  I was  You know how angry  That made my wife  When that happened  Well that'll do it  So you know  That's not far from the truth  But then  Bring home a girlfriend  Then you end the engagement 
[00:37:00]  I mean how far  Are you going to take  Something like that  Are you really going to marry her  You're going to go to  I want  Even though he's not  A little Max anymore  Because I've seen  I've seen him on TV and stuff  He's a big boy now  But I want my own Max  You don't get a Max  Alright  If you're going to get married  I know how people are  When they're going to do that  Remember this  Yeah  No matter what kind of  Hatred winds up building  Between the two of you  Which you hear why he's laughing  Because he knows  Oh yeah  He's been there  Yeah 
[00:37:30]  No because he knows  What's coming  Yeah  You know so enjoy  Those first couple weeks  No matter what happens  When the disdain sets in  When all the little things  That you loved about her  Right  Make you just absolutely despise her  Like when all of a sudden  They're sitting with a fucking box  Of Cheez-Its  On the bed  Crunching  With the bun in her hair  And no makeup  And walking around the house  With fucking flip flops  Hitting the back of her fucking feet  Where all those cute things  Fucking make you want to vomit 
[00:38:00]  At that moment in time  Don't ever think of divorcing her  Ever  Because if you do have  Your own little Maxes  Even after the divorce  The settlement  The alimony  The child support  And you could turn around  To Anthony and go  Boy I'm glad  That's all over  Right  That's  When it first begins  Because now  All they're left with  Is the anger  And the hatred for you  That maybe you do have 
[00:38:30]  A new girlfriend  That you like  And that you're getting into  So  No matter what she does  When you're married to her  You can't get mad  If  If you  If in the middle of the night  She was angry  Maybe during dinner  And she takes an electric sore  And cuts off your foot  You look at her and go  Oh  That must have been an accident  I didn't  I didn't  I didn't really  Like that foot anyway  That's my bad foot  That foot's  How did you know  I love you 
[00:39:00]  If she cuts your whole  Fucking leg off  Go  I love you for that  Because you knew  It was itching  You know  Shit like that  Never  Ever leave  Get a thousand girlfriends  Get them apartments  Whatever the fuck they want  Bury your stuff  Your fucking balls  Right up that  Fucking pirate's eye  Just don't ever  Leave the wife  Always look at her  And smile and go  You're the fucking best  You got it  And you'll be thanking me  A couple years from now  Yeah 
[00:39:30]  You'll thank me  The anger  And the expense  That goes along with  The divorce  Is  Ridiculous  There's no other  You could be  An astronaut  Doesn't have as much  Stress and pressure  On him  As a guy  Going through a divorce  It's just  The worst  Fucking thing  You get to the point  Where you're frothing  At the mouth  That you're so angry  With another human being  That you just  You're wishing  And not just  I wish that person 
[00:40:00]  Was dead  You're wishing  Actual death on people  Just so this ends  Just so it like  Ends  And the  The like  Physical  I actually used  To do a joke  About that  And I was even  In love at the time  You know what I mean  I say  You know  It's not even  About marriage  I go  When I break up  With a girl  You know  I just like  I'm dead  This way  You know  You're not going  To run into them  At the grocery  You know  Nobody's going  To come back  And say  Oh you know  What she said 
[00:40:30]  About you  After you know  You've been  Clobbering her  With your fucking  Cock for years  You know what I mean  Nobody's  Nobody's going  To come back  Right  Why'd you move  The mic  When you wanted  To laugh  See you don't even  Know what you just did  What the hell  Is wrong with you  I'm fucking around  But I'm saying  You know  So I would say that  Because it does  It just gets brutal  Even if it's a girlfriend  Or somebody  Maybe you fucked  One or two times  By accident  You know what I mean  Shit like that 
[00:41:00]  You know  It just never ends  Yeah  But you can't talk  Anyone out of it  Not that I would  I mean  No I don't want to  Talk you out of it  I'm sure she's a nurse girl  And that  But the whole  I don't understand  How anyone gets married  These days  No matter how much  You feel about the person  The married thing  Is it just  Amazes me  I've seen too much  Grief come out of it  And even the happiness  The happily married people  They joke about  Being miserable  All the time  Are you making a big wedding  Are you doing that  By then 
[00:41:30]  You know  Everybody hates  Everybody anyway  But did you do  The big wedding  Back in the day  No  I don't  No  No  We went  Kenny you even remember  Right  We went one day  Kenny wasn't there  But it was like  A week  I wasn't in concert  To be quite honest  Right  And I said  Why don't  Because I wanted  To marry her  For a couple years  So we went  You know  Just to a temple  You know  I had a little talk  With the rabbi  But you're from Brooklyn  You're like Italian  I thought  No  No  It's not about 
[00:42:00]  What are you  Stopping my flow  I'm trying to tell you something  It was just  It was a rabbi  It was some of the rabbi's friends  That were hanging around  You know  For a witness  And you know  We went for lunch  Then we went home  And went to sleep  We already had a kid  Yeah  That's nice  My kid had the best time  He had a better honeymoon than me  We went to Hawaii  It worked for you  And I never saw a kid  Have so much fun  I was miserable  Hey  Yeah  With the non-speaking lady  That came with us 
[00:42:30]  You know  Whatever the fuck she was  Nanny or whatever  Yeah  All right  Yeah  Non-speaking  So why  So I'm just getting off  Our argument for a minute  You're right  You know  It's fine  I'm not going back to that  But what's up with poor Kenny  Kenny doesn't know why you hate him  I don't know  I don't really  What could you say to poor Kenny  If I had to say it quick  You know  What really bugged me  Because Kenny  You know  Well we're not close today  But  His dry hair  I looked at Kenny 
[00:43:00]  As one of my best friends  Like you looked at me  As a friend  Right  And  I don't know  I don't want to do it on the air  Because  You know what I mean  It's  I don't want to say  The other person's name  He might know  Without  Maybe you're talking code  Maybe you're talking code  So Kenny  You know  When Max had his bar mitzvah  The double talk  Alright  So  Max flying in  Right  Kenny  You're scared of him  No  No 
[00:43:30]  This is it  At Max's  Bar mitzvah  At his bar mitzvah  Which  You know  Kenny went up  And he did stuff  On  You know  The pulpit  The whole thing  Because  One of my best friends  But  At that  You know  At the bar mitzvah  He mentioned somebody  I talked about  Some of  My ex-wife's friends  That didn't show up  I was like  You see  They didn't even  Back her up at this  And these are people  I fought about  And he brought up  One in particular  And said  I talk to her a lot 
[00:44:00]  And Kenny knows  I'm  You know  I am about loyalty  With my friends  And I felt that  And I  Just looked at him  I didn't want to argue  With him  Because there was  A bar mitzvah happening  And it really  Just bothered me  That  You were having  Conversations with her  Because you told me  You talk to her a lot  You know who I'm talking about  So two years later  You got upset with him  Yeah  And  And it was like  She was hanging with my  She took like  The side of the wife  And Kenny's my friend  And I would confide in him  And you know what 
[00:44:30]  You know  He's never been through a divorce  And I hope you never  Do go through a divorce  But when you're braced  Are you really?  No  When did that happen?  What the fuck?  So  It just bothered me  And I say  In my mind  I  You know  I just couldn't be friends  Because I'm like  Here's somebody  I totally confide in  I even  One thing I will bring up  That  I was screaming at him  One day  Because  He actually told  I think it was Norton  That I was getting divorced  Right  And we talked about this yesterday 
[00:45:00]  And I flipped out  Going  Why the fuck  You know  This I could say  Why the fuck  Would you tell Norton  Anything  That's going on  You know  With my wife  Why would you do that?  If I want to tell him  I'm getting fucking divorced  I'll be the one to tell him  Right  You know  But you know  Look  Everybody's got their own personality  Personality  But  The point  No  But  So  He didn't do it maliciously  But it was something  I wouldn't do  You know what I mean? 
[00:45:30]  So it really bothered me  Why didn't you explain that to him?  Because I was really angry  It was like  With  But that's what  Not the Norton thing  The Norton thing  I said to him  We were in Vegas at the time  But that's the ongoing theme today  It's like  Okay  We get it  But why don't you explain this to  I gotta be who I am  To people that are  Quote your friends  Because  I looked at it  As you are my friend  And you know  You're talking to this person  And now you told me you are  You know  And  You know  I'm having him  You know  In the ceremony  For my kid's bar mitzvah 
[00:46:00]  And  You know  Through all the years  You know  There were times  Kenny didn't work for me  That we'd fight  You know  And  I would bring him back  Because he was my friend  Right  There was even a time  Where my ex-wife would say  Why don't you just fucking fire him  I go  What do you mean  You're talking like I know the guy  For a day  He's my friend  You know  You just don't fire your fucking friend  I mean  You know  15 years before that  Who cares  And even then  In a month  He was working for me again  Because I liked him  And we built the friendship  But you know 
[00:46:30]  15 years later  What do you mean  Just fire him  Just call me  You're fired  Right  This isn't a job  With a corporation  I'm a fucking comic  I got more angry at Huff  For saying that  You know  Because  He was somebody  That watched my back  All those years  That was my joke  You know  I'm just reworking it  It worked that time  I missed it  Sorry  I missed the big joke  You said I got angry at her  And Opie said  What did you tell her  Three years later  See because you hold  The anger in so long  No but I didn't hold 
[00:47:00]  Did him with her  See I could be fine  No of course not  Now that I see  Yeah that I  You didn't  See I think  Dice figures also  No so  Why is it always  Dice's job  To have to call people  And say  And have the talk  But wait a minute  Wait a minute  So anyway  That's what happened  That's why  I was angry  With Kenny  I mean I saw him today  I'm glad to see you today  I'm glad I'm up here  You know just  Like when I made up  With Snowden  I didn't go in  To fight  You know what I mean  Yeah you want  You want to talk it out  You want to put it  Behind us or not  You know that's how I am 
[00:47:30]  Because you know  It is  Life is  You know it's  Fucking temporary  And you know  If there are people  You like  Sooner or later  You got to make up  With them  That's it  Or else it's a waste  If you don't have  Your friends  If I'm  You know  Jameson's with me  All the time  Florentine  When he's not headlining  Will work with me  You know  He doesn't even look  To take money from me  When he works  We just like being together  Right right  You know I mean  You know thank god  Norton's career  Took off  You know what I mean  And he's doing phenomenal 
[00:48:00]  And I was glad to see that  You know and I'm glad  I was part of  Pushing him a little  That he opened for me  And met you guys  And now he's got  You know his own career  That's great  Well people  I was actually angry  When Kenny  Wait a minute  Jim's on the show  Let me finish  Just statement  Jim's on the show  Because of you  No no  But I'm not taking credit  For this  I'm just saying  It's a shame  That we haven't been talking  Because if I'm fighting  With you guys  Well you know  Can't call Morton  Because you know  He's in that camp  You know  And it's really stupid 
[00:48:30]  Especially because  We are people that make  The whole country laugh  You know  I mean even  When 9-11 happened  You guys had to go  On the air  You know what I mean  It was all you guys  That had to  You know  Keep it moving  And try to make  Whatever relief  You could make happen  For people  You know  Think if there was no radio  If there were no comics  If there  You know  You can't just keep it  A constant battle  When I go on stage  My anger  Is funny  Because it's fake anger 
[00:49:00]  It's an angry comic  But if you go on  With real anger  And there were a couple years  I did go on that way  I wasn't funny  Because I meant every word  I really did hate  Going on stage  I was going through  An awful marriage  Divorce  Whatever the fuck it was  Obviously I'm not  Too fucking mad now  You know what I mean  I've gotten past  A lot of fucking things  You sure did  But that's how I am  But no  Now when I perform  I'm having a good time  Right  You know  That's the difference  Even my father always says 
[00:49:30]  He goes  He goes  I don't care how dirty you are  As long as you're funny  He goes  When you go up  Angry about something  And that were years  I went through a lot of shit  You know  Like we all do  There were years  I went up there  And I didn't want to be up there  But yet  My job is to make people laugh  At the end of the day  No matter what you go through  At the end of the day  Make them laugh  Because if they're paying  To see you  And to laugh  At the shit  They're going through  It's my job  To make that happen  Right  So you know  There's just a lot of shit 
[00:50:00]  That's gone down  So with Kenny  Let's get a moment  Let's get a moment  From Kenny  How are you feeling today  Kenny  I didn't know  This was going to happen  Until 15 minutes  Before it happened  I know  He didn't  No but  I even would tell  Kenny  I even told Jameson  We've talked about this  Because he's with me a lot  And I say  You know  He would say  Does Kenny know  Like what happened  With you guys  And I would tell him  The story  And who it was  And I would say  You know  You can tell him that  Because  I mean 
[00:50:30]  You know  Things do pass  You know  You don't stay angry  Full time  You know  And you know  It really bothered me  Too  That we weren't talking  You know  And  And that's it  You know  To go any further  And tell him  That was the reason  I was angry with him  Because it was a lot  Of years together  I think if somebody  Was talking to  My ex-wife  And then I found out  One of my friends  Was talking with her  Like that  That would probably  Piss me off  Yeah  And  It would seem like 
[00:51:00]  A thing  Do you remember  When you told me  Personally  I don't know  The situation  But I think  That would piss me off  Yeah  Yeah but  I don't want to  Say anything  You might not remember  Or maybe you do remember  Do you remember  When you told me that  No I don't specifically  Remember  But I  We were up at the pool  At the hotel  And you said  I said  Why isn't she here  And you said  She wanted you  To invite her  And I looked at you  Like  Like why would you not  And you said  Well I talk to her a lot  And that  You know  I didn't want to argue with it  It was a beautiful occasion  Number one 
[00:51:30]  But it was stressful  So we got to watch  Every word we say  No not at all  It might come out  Ten years later  You know what  Ten years  When it comes to my  Two boys  I am completely defensive  I can't argue that point  I understand  But wow  I should have just  Told someone sooner  Is all I'm saying  What do you got on Anthony  That's going to come out  Like years from now  Nothing  I love the impression  Okay  I would even say on the air  I don't even care what he says  Because  He does the bed skate  Because he has the best impression of me  It's the reason I ever came up here  Kenny would call me constantly 
[00:52:00]  And go  That Anthony was on again  Doing you know  Andrew Dice gay  Just before I ever came up here  Andrew Dice gay  That was a fun one  He's going to be at the Olive Garden  We had you as a janitor back in the day  You know  Whatever it was  You know  And um  He goes  You got to do something  You got to go up there  So he's really the one that  Brought me up here  Yeah  Because I didn't know you guys  I think you were just on in New York  At the time  Yep  And I'm going  Kenny  What do I get  Let him do the impression  It's good  Yeah but he says  You're going to be at the Olive Garden 
[00:52:30]  But he's saying it like he's you  You know how he talks  Yeah  But he's not me  And the people listening  Know he's not me  And then  Kenny doesn't know  This could hurt you Andrew  They're saying bad things about you  Yeah he really did  But  Do you want me to crack some skulls  But that's what I'm talking about  With loyalty  That was  His loyalty to me  Calling me  And  And just not liking  Even though it's a great impression  He didn't like  How you did  The whole idea is  Making fun of the person  You're doing  So out of loyalty  Didn't he deserve 
[00:53:00]  Like an explanation  Not after that  In my opinion  No  I'm not going to understand that  Anytime soon  Because  Because it was almost like  In my opinion  Maybe I'm wrong  It was like a slip  When he told me  He's talking to her  You know  And that is  It's not even like  Talking to another guy  It's  It's the wife's  Closest friend  So I'm going  In my mind  I saw both of them  Talking on the phone  He's telling her  About what I'm feeling  Oh god damn  You know  And that girl  Even brought problems  Into 
[00:53:30]  The last relationship  I had  You know  Bullshitting about  You know  She's just a  Big fucking mouth  Just a big  Fucking mouth  No  But I don't have to  Tell her off  Because I'm not close  With her  Yeah  You know  I don't have to  Not be friends with her  You understand  I know  You're the guy  That gets that  I do get that part  Because  If she cuts both  Your legs off  You still love her  Remember that  I'll remember  Thank you 
[00:54:00]  Just put a little  Metal cup around  Your  God  Keep that there  You can still bounce  Even if you got stubs  Look at Kenny  I didn't know  I mean we are here  I mean you know  I'm glad we have  Some closure  No I never know  Don  Don and Jim  Used to tell me  That you know  You would always  Ask about me  And say nice things  About me  But they never  Told me the reason  Because you're 6'5  And they're scared 
[00:54:30]  And you're not all there  Yeah  You might take it  The wrong way  Yeah  No I  You know  Even when  Kenny went through  The  Are you allowed  To talk about it all  Yeah yeah  I'm retired now  I got my pension  Okay good  When he went  Through this thing  Through the retirement  Let me tell you  Even when he went  Through that  You know  And I was angry  At him  Defended you  You know  When I  I was asked  About it  By actually  A newspaper  I don't know  What newspaper  But on the air  I defended him 
[00:55:00]  You know  You know  Because one thing  Has nothing to do  With the other  I mean I've been  Close with him  And his family  Most of my life  Really  My adult life  So I'm not  Going to rip apart  Somebody  Because I'm angry  About something else  Right  You know  What I mean  So I defended  Him with that  And the only thing  I did get angry  About is  Why didn't you  Just book  Every club  In the country  That day  That's all  I could think  Is  I go  He's all  He's all over  The news  Everybody knows 
[00:55:30]  The name  Ken Fetter  Today  Or I don't know  Ken Fetter  Why didn't he just  Call Dennis  And book  Every fucking club  In the country  At a $60 ticket  Fuck the pension  That you make more  In two weeks  Than you make  In three lifetimes  That's all  I went crazy  Like I wanted to call you  And go  What are you waiting for  You know  Because you know  Those things  You know  Well let's book it tomorrow  It was so big  It'll have the same effect  It was like  It was like 
[00:56:00]  Fetter mania  You know  And I'm going  Where is he  You know  I'll put him in front of me  Let's just book it  It's like when  The guy  Remember when  You would remember this  The first  The millionaire guy  Right  Yeah  And I called this guy  He was a comic  And it was like  One of the first reality shows  Like marry a millionaire  And he married that  The fuck was her name  The one she wound up  Like showing her  Slicing  Dara Conger  Yeah  Yeah  She paraded her little 
[00:56:30]  Hatchet cut around town  For a while  Yeah look at me  This is me now  Look at  Like my smile  Fucking bunch of slobs  All of them  Anyway  What happened is  When that show happened  You know  I knew the guy  You know  And I called him  I said look  Because I knew he wasn't  A phenomenal comic  But he's got ten minutes  I said  If you want to open for me  My agent said  You'll open for me  We'll book a whole tour  You've got to do ten minutes  I'm the one  I've got to come out  And do an hour 
[00:57:00]  So he's all into it  And then because  The media was all over him  Because he was just  A talentless guy  Really  You know  He calls me up  He's booked for Larry King  And he goes  You don't understand  I've got to go on King  Like it's his buddy  And clear my name  And that was the last time  I heard of him  Or anybody heard of him  That was this  You know  But that was a guy  That was struggling in comedy  For twenty years already  You know  Kenny is a law enforcement person  That got the shot of a lifetime 
[00:57:30]  And I'm going  Book  Just fucking book the road  Did you say that to him?  The way you're shaking your head  No it makes sense now  Maybe we should have thought  To do  That's all I can think  I'm going  This is  This is a gold mine  I think he was worried  About his pension  At the time  To be honest with you  I think he  He was scared  Out of his fucking wits  He didn't know  What was going to happen  To him  And he's got the two kids  And stuff  And he needed to make sure  They did the right thing  The police department  Oh so you were nervous  About that  Yeah  Yeah yeah 
[00:58:00]  I didn't know  You know  It was a bad scene  At the time  Yeah but  I was thinking  I don't know  You know  Everyone's phones  Are going off  Yeah but you didn't see mine  Huh?  What's yours?  Of course you have the best  That's not about the best  Is it the ring?  I call it  Commando  Commando  Wow  Oh okay  The underwater phone  Underwater phone  So you can call people  From underwater  This is Dylan now  I'm underwater  I'm a 13 year old

[00:59:30]  You know what I mean?  And you wait  They can't catch you  Because you're underwater  But your phone still works  Well why get in a fight  With a guy  You're gonna fuck up your clothes  You're gonna fuck everything up  So you wait  So you jump in  You call the police  He's there alone  Because you're underwater  And he's looking for you  And you got the phone  You got the phone  The cops show up  Who cares about music  There's a radio in a car  I don't care if it downloads music  It's Commando  I'm under here now  You're a mess

I was proud of my attack  Okay  I'm happy that you're proud of it  I'm sad that the relationship  Fell apart  It happens  But I'm starting to think  I don't think  It's not like we roll over  In the morning  And go good morning honey  You guys  You had a relationship  We had a verbal disagreement  That's why I don't have  Any friends off the air 
[01:01:30]  That I met  I was more saying  About Kenny than you  Of course  You should be  You guys  You've been there  For a long time  I'm not trying to like  You know  Make more of it  But  I didn't like  Yeah how come  You don't care  With how he feels  Kenny?

I never understood that  No cause the brother's like  Hello hello  And he's just sitting there  With the phone  But he's nuts 
[01:04:30]  And he had a lifelong thing  About getting him down  We're trying to prove two things  Two things  I'm nuts  And he got a lifelong thing  About getting me down  And Kenny's more of a woman  Than all of us  And he was  You call those carrots  He was deeply  You call those carrots  Alright Kenny  You're on your own  Bring it over here  Bring it over here  You want your steak  Bring it over here  You missed my prime  And everything  Where have you been?  Isn't that the greatest scene?  I love that scene  Can't we talk about  Something fun for a minute 
[01:05:00]  And then  I'll sit here  You can just yell at me  I was sleeping  Till ten minutes  Before I had to come up here  I haven't yelled  I'm not saying yell  I mean it like  As a euphemism  Took fun little  Cute little jabs  What does euphemism mean?  I don't know  It's good though  Like something else  But yeah  It's a young-mism  So I actually said it right?  I actually said it  Boo  What about the big sandwiches  At the Carnegie Deli  I'm remembering  I'm reading more stuff now  What about the big sandwiches?  Him with the memories 
[01:05:30]  I loved having it with you  See I'm just trying to make  You know and the black cherry soda  You think I forgot that?  Extra ice  I'm allergic to cherries  Thanks for all  One of my favorite  Dice experiences  Was going  Walking down  Sweatshirt shopping  And buying the big  Everlast sweatshirts  That we said  Maybe I should take  Like a medium  And he's like  No extra large  For everybody  And we all walked around  With giant sweatshirts on  Did you call that giant  Today you could get  8X  9X  10X  You know how phenomenal 
[01:06:00]  That is  They were giant  Yeah that's what I like  Giant  Giant clothes  And then he was haggling  Like we were in Bangladesh  Yeah  He's haggling  For the price of the guy  No but you know the best  Is when you get close  To the person  Yeah  Now I actually put my arm  Around them  And I go  Listen to me  And I say it like  We're talking about  Cash  Like I'm the only one  That has some on me  Cash  Yeah I'm going to pay you in  Cash 
[01:06:30]  Okay  So what are you going to do here  And you look around  Like there's a hundred people  Watching  I did it with Commando  Ah the underwater phone  Yeah  I walked  You know what  So  Just wait  Just wait for the underwater phone  You know what  You want to know  What assholes people really are  You ever go buy a phone  Oh yeah  Okay so  So I went in  Because I knew it was late at night  Like right before they close  Right  And there's like ten sales people  Standing around doing nothing  This is what fucking robots 
[01:07:00]  These assholes are  And I come over to a guy  I go  Yeah  I'm looking for a phone  Whatever you know  And uh  Guy goes  Alright  You just got to check in  You know like where you got  Yeah you know where you got to like  Put your name in like a computer  Yeah  Which I don't know how to do  Okay  And I'm going  I am checking in  With you  I go  There's nobody here  But they're so robotic  I nearly walk  I nearly didn't own  Commando  Of course it is  That would have been tragic  Because I'm actually looking at the guy  Going you're fucking kidding me 
[01:07:30]  Right  Yeah  I go there's nine people  Standing  You're going to close in 15 minutes  Check  Check what  Check what  Go get me a phone  Go in the back  And get me a phone  That's what it became  Because I was so angry  Infuriating  And right there and then  I let him know how I felt  But I was good  Yeah  No you got to get your feelings out  That's what you're saying  I think you're learning that right  Yeah  Where's Jimmy on this whole thing  I think that what happened was  Is that a bunch of people  Who genuinely liked each other 
[01:08:00]  Hurt each other's feelings  Everybody got their feelings hurt  And no one is good at saying  My feelings are hurt  A bunch of women  But that's what it is  No one's good at saying  You know what  That hurts  Men we don't react that way  We get fucking angry  Fuck you  It's very hard to go  Fuck man  That kind of hurt  When you say  That stung a little bit  Very difficult to do that  Even the thing with Kenny  Like I was hurt  I was hurt  Now it's all about being hurt  That he didn't call me  I'm going to have friends  With the guy  You know my whole life  Why isn't he calling me 
[01:08:30]  Right right  Why do I got a call all the time  Well in my case  I didn't know you were mad at me  Or I would have called you right away  Alright so  So a couple years later  When I got angry  Why didn't you call me  A couple years  No because  How am I going to be mad at you  For hanging out in the gym  And pumping iron  What am I going to get mad then  And ruin the workout  We're in the cage at that moment  What about the special hike  The hike was nice  You've done the hike Kenny  The mountain  The mountain  Well it's a little hill  But it's nice  Really  You had a tough time 
[01:09:00]  Going up that mountain  Trust me  No we had to stop  I don't like the mountain  You don't like the mountain  Yeah he does  He never liked the mountain  He did it but he didn't like it  He has special rules  You got to stop at certain points  And take a look at the view  You got to spit the water out  Spit the water  The whole thing  You get in the cage  It's exhausting  I forgot how exhausting  Dice is  To hang out with  You're exhausting  But you did the mountain  Didn't you  Yeah we sat  And you were happy  Once you got there  I think there was like a  Like a bench up there  And we were  Overlooking LA  And we were having moments  That would have been  That would have been 
[01:09:30]  You should have done  The max thing there  That wasn't the time  I'm thinking you should have  Done it there  How can I start screaming  I'm exhausted  What do you mean  That's not the time  Sweating  What do you want  You're waiting for us  To climb Mount Everest together  No I'm saying  We were having a great time  There'd be no reason  To get angry  So you just kept  Having good times  Until  Until I got angry  It was years later  Yeah  And then he got angry  He buries things  We all  A lot of times  We bury things  Like it's in there  It's in there  And then one day  A cap just comes off  And it comes out  It's really  I remember 
[01:10:00]  We filmed that scene  At the comedy store  I was a bad actor  Yeah now you come up  With some of the moments now  Yeah no we were filming that  We were having fun  Yeah  I was hoping to see that somewhere  About Dylan saving his school  Sure  Right  You have it on a loop  That he swung through  He has it on a loop somewhere  He watches it a lot  No that he swung through  The window of the school  He was like  To stop these terrorists  Oh  He was like a superhero  Yeah he was a superhero  Type of guy  See we talked about your kids a lot 
[01:10:30]  I know  And then you made him feel bad  One of them  But I didn't know  And you didn't tell me  Now you know  And now all this  Now what  Well  How great is this then  If I didn't do what I did  This could have never happened  What about  This is a great moment  This moment would never be  You never helped me  With my window treatments  Remember  You were walking around my place  Going oh  Window treatments  Good thing too  I took you clothing shopping  I didn't even know  What window treatments were  But a good thing he didn't  Because you left that place

[01:11:30]  Piss stains  You go to the bathroom  You come back  It looks like you  Fucking came in your pants  And everybody's looking  And you're in  Fuck beige  And anybody that wears it  So this is really weird  Like Kenny hasn't seen  Dice in four years  But it doesn't feel like that  Now that I'm seeing him  That's what I'm saying  It doesn't feel like that  He's just as handsome  How do you feel Kenny  He is just as handsome  Those chiseled cheekbones 
[01:12:00]  The blue aisles  That sparkle like the Nile  Oh see  Kenny you're the worst  A little more far ahead  Mike Cole checking in  Mike Cole's checking in  Saying that he thinks  Opie might be worried  Now that Kenny's gonna leave  Oh I would still lose that one  Who's Mike Cole  He's a cop friend of ours  He's one of my new friends  That tells me when he's mad at me  He might be  And we work it out over beer  Like that  And then we move back  To the fun times  Is GH getting worried 
[01:12:30]  Kenny's gonna leave  Go back to Andrew  Kenny holds a grudge  Like a mosquito  He's right back in his camp  I go to the highest bidder  Like nothing  Like nothing  The highest bidder  It took 30 seconds  To understand  Understanding  He had me from hello  He likes the  Kenny likes the drama  Oh Kenny loves drama  He loves  Oh he loves talking about it  Andrew these guys think 
[01:13:00]  I'm very pessimistic  Yeah  Like always giving them bad news  Like remember like when  Oh yeah  He used to first wake up  Dad I forgot  See  This was Kenny right  I could wake up  My fucking throat  Alright I'm good  I could wake up  In the morning right  In a great mood  We'd be like in Vegas  Like you know  Venetian  Headline  Great  You know  Here comes Kenny  And I see the face  He's got a face on  And I'm going  Everything alright

[01:15:30]  The stir fry  And the shopping  And the  That makes  No no no no  Tell them the real shit  And then you tell me  About how  The comedy store is haunted  And we were there  In the back room  Scared  No that's not what I'm talking about  And you know it see  How about when they  Butterflied his  His steak  The time  You said your steak  Back three times  Do you remember  No  When I told you  We're talking about  All bullshit stuff  And what he  Felt with me  Alright  But when you guys  Weren't on the air

[01:20:30]  Are you going to go on  Howard now and say  I was there  And they had three fans  In the stands  Because that'll hurt us  I don't have to  You just said it  That'll make us  That'll make us sad  And that's Stan  You don't know him  You don't know any of these guys  How's it going  How are you  He's a fucking  Barrel of laughs  Barrel of laughs  He's a comic  An aspiring comic  Oh yeah  Okay cool  He's leaving the show  Get him a little  If he becomes a big star  I gotta hang on film  I love this  There  You got that  So  Do you know him 
[01:21:00]  Norton  Oh yeah  Anything  Yeah  Yeah  It's funny  It's very dry  Hey it's Mark Maron  From the WTF podcast  I'm also hosting this  This thing I'm doing now  Opie and Anthony  Listener Request Show  This is it  More of your picks  And requests  Are coming up  After the break  Open Anthony presents  The all request  Worst Of Show  Call 8774  Worst Of  And get your favorite  Bits on the air  More of your worst  Of Opie and Anthony 
[01:21:30]  Next  In the last segment  A caller actually  Requested this  This is Wax from New Jersey  I want to request  One of my favorite  Worst Of moments  And that's the  Triumphant return  Of Andrew Dykes Clay  To the O&A show  So do it a bit  Continuing on  With that bit  Here's part three  Now what  I'm just glad  That no one's  Feelings are hurt anymore  Yeah  Everybody was very sad  On some level  About it  Yeah we know that  Even here  Because it's radio  It's hard to like  Be 
[01:22:00]  I don't know  Completely real  Because we gotta  Almost like  Put on a little show  But it's okay  Because  It's a reason  For us to get together  No I mean  I'm being honest  But maybe a little animated  Well I can't see  The mics going off  And us going  You know  Go fuck yourself  No no  I'm not talking about that  I'm saying this was a good  What can I tell you something about  That's why we didn't  Take a break yet  Because I know damn well  So those mics go off  Is going to be like  No one wants to deal  With that moment  Oh what you think  Is going to be awkward  See that I don't have a problem with  No awkwardness  In probably a good way 
[01:22:30]  A nice way  That's what I mean  Like it's easier  To do it on the air  I came in a little more  I'm not mad  Yeah I didn't really  I wasn't ready for that  You were ready for it  You were okay  I felt it  I felt the vibe  I was  Yeah  Helmets hit  Well now that you lost weight  That could happen  So  Yeah exactly  Little joke  You know  I get it  See I get it  When you do the joke  I'll find out  If you get it  Five years from now  Is that like a thing 
[01:23:00]  When you laugh  You move the mic  Can I do it again  I don't know  Yeah you got  We all got our thing  Oh I know why  I'll tell you why  Why do you do that  Because I don't want to laugh  Directly in the mic  Because some people think  That's really obnoxious  Oh really  So I'm trying to laugh off the mic  That's all  That's all that is  No I thought it was like a thing  Like when I put the cigarette  Behind the head  You're still not smoking  The cigarettes  Seven years  But you still hold the cigarette  Yeah I like it  Do you talk to anyone  About these issues  The fact I don't want to light it  Is a good thing 
[01:23:30]  But why do I need it at all  Because they're free  Like why don't you  Walk around with your  Underwater phone instead  You know  Two pigs don't do it  I got the underwater phone  I got the cigarette  But you could be walking around  With the underwater phone instead  Get rid of the cigarette  I like the cigarette  I like it  But you don't smoke the cigarette  Yeah but who says you have to  I bet you have the same pack  From four years ago  No no no  I go through like a pack a day  Yeah yeah you have to  It probably gets like loose  And the tobacco falls out  You go through a pack a day  But it's not smoking  I quit nearly what  Seven years ago  Kenny would know  Wow  March of 
[01:24:00]  I'm glad Kenny came over here  Kenny  When did he start smoking  See I didn't know  You were going to be here  And Norton told me last night  So it was like  We didn't tell Kenny  Because we knew  He'd obsess about it all day  And he would be somewhere else  Right Kenny  Yeah I mean  I still didn't figure out  What I was going to do  Like tomorrow  When I was supposed to see it  Yeah that was the other thing  I told Jimmy  It's going to be awkward  For Kenny too  You got Dice on the show  Which I think is great  And you haven't seen Kenny  I think the shows  Are going to be great  And you haven't seen Kenny 
[01:24:30]  In so many years  I'm like well  That's not fair to Kenny  That all of a sudden  He's showing up  Not knowing why Dice  Was mad at him  For four years  No but  Let me ask you something  To get off of  Oh for a minute  Here  Okay  Does it  Make sense  What I'm saying  To you  I never knew  The reason  Alright so  Why didn't you call  No because  Like I knew  From past experience  But you could let it  Go a little while  See I would get mad 
[01:25:00]  Like  Let's say after  A month or two  That we didn't talk  Like  Why didn't you  Pick up a phone  And go  What's going on here  You know  Because I'm also  You know  Just for people  That might not know  I know most people  Do know  You know  That we were close  For all the years  Which means  I'm close with your wife  Your children  Right  You know what I mean  Right  So it's not like  I just lost you  As a friend  It's  You know  And your wife  Has always been  Completely dedicated  To you  That even when  You know 
[01:25:30]  It's funny  When Kenny first  Went to work for me  You know  I remember Michelle  Getting me on the phone  And going  So in other words  When he's 80  He'll be walking  Next to you  Would have came  I mean  She would like  Think of it that way  You know what I mean  And you know  Just really concerned  And then  Years later  This was  A little before it happened  She had me on the phone  And you know  Always concerned  About our relationship  Not like she was  Out of it  You know what I mean  She was always in there  And you know 
[01:26:00]  So it bothered me  Because I always thought  She was great  Right  I actually just looked  At those tapes  Of the Concord  With the  I would do stare downs  With his wife  Because nobody could  Do them like that  And I would say  I was actually  Showing Eleanor  And I go  I go  She's a cop's wife  That's why she could  Do it like that  Right  And one time  She looked right through  One of my ex-wife's friends  At a New Year's Eve party  Yeah  Yeah  A friend that  I just can't  Fucking stand  You know 
[01:26:30]  And  Michelle comes in the kitchen  And goes  Alright Kim  We gotta go  You know  It's like one in the morning  Already you know  And this girl  Comes over  All fucked up  Already you know  Why don't you stay  And Kenny's wife  Number one  I thought she was  Gonna throw this girl  A beating  And she just looked  Right through her  You know  Like  Dark holiday  In Tombstone  Yeah  Just looked right through  And went  I got two kids  I gotta take care 
[01:27:00]  Of six in the morning  Do you  And not even  Looking at Kenny  Staring right through  This girl  And goes  Let's go  Ken  Oh  But it was like  Let's go  Before she kicks  The shit out  Of this girl  Yeah  Cause she knew  How I felt  About that girl  You know what I mean  So yeah  You know  And your kids  You know  You lose touch  Of all that  That's a bad thing  Yeah  You know  What's going on  With his kids  I don't know  If he talks about it all  Well you know 
[01:27:30]  A little known fact  That when my boys  Were young  Andrew nicknamed  My boys combat  And shootout  And as  As we speak  No I know that  Combat is going  To Iraq tomorrow  Tomorrow  Yeah he's leaving  Oh man  He's a cop  In the air force  Is he real  See I don't know  The whole story  It's hard to pull  Over a plane  Yeah  Hold on  See we do  Sound effects now 
[01:28:00]  It's fun right  That was an awful joke  No that's a heavy thing  And you know  I just  You know  I just wish him  You know  Just health  That's it  You know  I love your boys  And that's how  I feel about them  Even if I didn't see you  Right  You know  I heard about it  And I was like  Alright let's just  You know  I pray for your boys  Believe me  I love them  You know  My sentiments are the same  For your boys  You know  We all grew up together  I know  It's  On the road  Yeah 
[01:28:30]  Do you know  Jeffrey  His older son  When we did  We went to the Concord  Many years ago  We thought we were going  On a vacation  And every high school  In the world was there  You know  We just wanted quiet  From the concerts  But that's not  What I'm getting at  Jeffrey was what  Two  Barely walking  So all of a sudden  This is how he gets  The nickname  Because he's just  Walking  We're walking  In this long hallway  And there's another kid  Basically not doing anything 
[01:29:00]  And Jeffrey decided  Why not just throw him  A beating  And we're running  Down this long hallway  At the Concord  Tackling this kid  And just  Careening his fist  Into him  And  I was  I was amazed at it  I'm going  Look at this kid go  Right  And then as time  Went on  And Jeffrey got a little  Older  Because  You know  He's a tough  He's a tough kid  You know  He would hit my hand 
[01:29:30]  When he was  Eight years old  And it would hurt  He once nearly  Beat up Norton  In Kenny's backyard  Oh yeah  That Norton was like  Alright  No  Alright  I get it  You know  And  But he would tell  Stories  Like  Like his war stories  Of kids having fights  And this is what's  Bugging me for a long time  And I couldn't call you  To ask you  That me and Max  Love the speech  That  Jeffrey gives a kid  He'll always warn the kid  The kid  If ten guys 
[01:30:00]  Walk over to Jeffrey  Like let's say  He had a problem in school  So now the guy  Comes like a bully  With ten friends  Jeffrey will calmly  Look at the kid  Because one time  A kid took off  His belt buckle  Right  And Jeffrey looks at him  And what is the speech  You'll say it better  You know it  You know  It's funny  I'm trying to remember it too  But Jeffrey would always  Try to make the other kid  Realize that he's making  A big mistake  A big mistake  And say something like 
[01:30:30]  This is your last warning  Right  You know  The next warning  Will be you on the ground  With my fist  Just crunching your face  Inside out  It was something like that  And he told us this story  In a Chinese restaurant  And me and my son  Were mesmerized  That we started coming up  For themes  For Fedder  Like it's coming to a movie theater  Like this summer  Jeffrey Fedder moves to L.A. 
[01:31:00]  You know  And you would see like a fist  Come into view  Because like  There's a lot of kids  That go to school in L.A.  That aren't tough kids  That won't act tough  And me and my son Max  Always go  What do you think Jeffrey  Would do to this guy?  Always  It's a constant  I mean this is over  The last few weeks  I go  Are you kidding?  Fedder?  He would annihilate this  This guy would be retarded  But we look  Coming this summer  Fedder  He's a big boy man 
[01:31:30]  Well last time I saw him  He was like six feet  Is he taller now?  Yeah yeah  He's in shape obviously  Oh yeah yeah yeah  Cause when Kenny came to the bar mitzvah  They were training in the gym  They were in the cage  Kenny  He's not as tall as Max  He's not as tall as you  Right?  What about Shootout?  He's spurting now  Okay good  He's you know  That's so funny  We used to love that  That's what I'm saying  Alright so  That could be 
[01:32:00]  So we didn't see  We  We  Add it out  Yeah  Yeah  I would say yeah  What's left is just the apology  I love Anthony  I would say yeah  The judge  I would say yes  I guess what's left is just the apology from you  And then everything's good  The most  The most important thing  Is that there's  No grudges held  What? 
[01:32:30]  Remember Tommy  Yes yes of course  With Salvi  I was trying to remember  Which line that was  But that is the most important thing  When you make up  It can't be a fake make up  No  Throw all grudges out the window  Yeah that's how it's really gotta be  That's it  Are anybody's feelings still hurt?  For real  Please  Nope  Too much therapy  I'd like to know if anyone's feelings are hurt  Because that's what prevents them from being hurt again  Jimmy are yours hurt?  No  I feel okay  Can I get some water?  Is that  Do you have a water gun?  I'll get it Andrew  Of course  Oh look at that  Just like old time 
[01:33:00]  Come on everybody  Just like  Just let him get it for you  He'll go crazy  If he doesn't let you get him water  You know that Dice  Dice  The other thing that you need to know is  Norton does a little therapy now  And he tries to bring his therapy onto the show  It's a little weird for everybody  Believe me  Nobody knows more about therapy than me  He wants us to open up more  And you know  He is like that  I realized that yesterday  Really?  But you know  I heard it  Therapy's great  I heard somebody to walk into a room 
[01:33:30]  And lay into for two hours  Here's some water for you too  Here's your 200 bucks  You fucking cocksucker  I used to love therapy  When I first went to  You know it was funny  When I first went to therapy  Was here in New York  When my career took off  And I didn't even go to therapy for me  I went to therapy to find out  How to handle my own parents  If you remember  Because my family was really  Like more overwhelmed than I was  With what was going on with me  And I was like  Like if I went up to my dad's office 
[01:34:00]  It was like a shrine  Like all I saw was me on the walls  And I complained to my mother  Going I can't even go to my own office  And get away from me  You know what I mean  That's what  You know  And that's the reason  I even tried to live back in Brooklyn  Because  Yeah  On stage  It's a tremendous ego  I say I'm the greatest  And that's it  And I go out  And I try to prove that  Time and time again  But off stage  I always tried to stay humble  And live back in Brooklyn  And it was kind of an impossibility 
[01:34:30]  I mean  Some people are very cool  Some people don't get  Why you're living back there  But  I would go to therapy  To go  My parents  Can't handle  What I'm going through  You know  And it wound up  Just sessions  Of laying into  But wasn't he just proud  I have to jump in here  No  Extremely proud  Right  You know  And actually  Without saying I'm doing  This thing with Norton  No no  It was all about being proud  Because my dad was the same way  I mean  He was my biggest fan  And he was so proud  But it's also just trying 
[01:35:00]  Like I would actually sit there  When my ex-wife  Would be pregnant with Max  And I would look at my mother  And go  Ma  Let's talk about her being pregnant  That's a pretty big thing  Right  We're having a child  You know  They were just that proud  And you know  You know  Obviously  You know  I became something  In this world  Because of their personalities  But you know  What I'm saying is  I'd go to therapy  And then what you talk about  After that is  So you know what  The therapist told me  Who really gives a fuck 
[01:35:30]  About a therapist opinion  Because I'd look at  This little asshole  With his glasses on  Going  Well  It's your mother  Did the  You know  Shut the  Did I get defensive  To the therapist  And go  Why don't you shut  Your fucking mouth  About my mother  Let's talk about  Your fucking mother  Okay  You  And I'd really get angry  At the therapist  But then you walk out  And you go  You know what he said  Who the fuck is he  You know what I mean  Yeah  But to anybody  And I used to love  Looking at people 
[01:36:00]  Sitting there  When I'd come out  Because everybody  Looks at the floor  You know what I mean  I go  What are you here for  What fucked you up  You little slob  You know  And  But  But  I think therapy is great  Just  I will pay  Just to lay into somebody  For a couple hours  Yeah  It's worth it  Just for that  So fuck them  And that's what therapy  Did for you  That's what therapy is  It's the easiest job  As a doctor  Gave you a punching bag  For a couple hours  Let me make you believe  I learned about the mind 
[01:36:30]  And then guys like us  Walk in there  And go  Why  And then when you realize  They don't have the answer  And you're paying them  Four hundred fucking dollars  That's when they learn  Why you're there  Because you tell them  What you think of them  And what they look like  And how they act  And what their fucking lives are  Yeah they don't need any  It's not any concrete thing  Like a doctor  Hey I got this  Take care of it  Yeah  Give me the five day pill  It's this vague  Give me some fucking penicillin  And get out of my life  You seem like a different dice 
[01:37:00]  Well yeah  Four years ago  In what way  What's the deal  Like  Obviously the divorce  Was brutal on you  Yeah  Brutal right  Brutal  Is there anything else  It's not the divorce  It's  I'm telling you  It's the  I make fun of it  But it's the after effects  Of what goes on  You know  That's why  You know  To be honest  And Kenny would notice too  That you know  I'm really close with my boys  And just really want  You know  Especially when I left 
[01:37:30]  To make sure that they grow up  And look who's talking  Without their minds getting messed up  You know what I mean  Because it's a very confusing time  So you know  I would look to just work  I had no career goal  It was more like  Go out  Make a living  And get home  And be with your kids  Right  You know  And that's what I've done  And they're two incredible  Human beings  You know  Today  You know  I got a 13 year old  Going on 30  Because they had to learn  The hard way  You know  They say never put the kids 
[01:38:00]  In the middle  But that's what goes on  I mean  You know  The therapist would say  You don't put kids in the middle  But in reality  You can't help but do that  Especially  If one or both parties  You know  Are doing the wrong thing  You can only keep  Them out of it  For so long  Not a huge effect on it  So yeah  You do change in certain ways  You know  Went through another relationship  You know  Got engaged for the minute  You know how that shit goes  Anthony  No  No you didn't get married 
[01:38:30]  I got married once  And that was it  No more engagement  I remember talking to you  With that stuff  No engagement  No nothing  I lay it right on the line  I'm not getting married  It just ain't gonna happen  You got a girlfriend  Ever again  You got a girlfriend  Right now no  Now  I understand  You went through  Some stuff  Yeah  I got a girlfriend  Now  The traffic girl  He's going on a date  With a traffic girl today  From TV  Fucking me to me  No not that kind of traffic girl

[01:46:30]  I called him up  I was bored to tears  You know  This is like 1988  So he's only my agent  For a minute  Right  So um  At that time  My ex  Was not my ex  So she's on the other phone  I go  Alright let's have some fun  Right  So I get the agent  On the phone  And I'm like  Uh  Yeah how you doing Dennis  You know  And he'd always hear me  In a good mood  You know  He goes  You alright  Ah  Just had a fight  With her  You know  You know 
[01:47:00]  You think you go  With a girl  You could tell him  Some things about yourself  And it'll be alright  She's  She's inside laughing at me  You know  He goes  Well what's the matter  You know  I go  You won't get it  You know  And if I told you  You're gonna laugh  And then I'll get aggravated  And he goes  No man  I mean that  You could tell me anything  I go  I really can't Dennis  Because you're just  Not gonna fucking get it  Okay  And I'm really upset  From this  Okay 
[01:47:30]  And I start to like  Cry a little on the phone  He's going  Calm down man  You can talk to me  I'm not just an agent  You know  So I go  Alright  I'm gonna tell you something  You know  And I just want you  To hear it  You know  And not many people  In my life  Know this about me  And he goes  Tell me  Tell me what she's laughing at  Because if you want  I'll talk to her  I'm Superman  So now that's quiet  And I go  See 
[01:48:00]  You don't believe me  Nobody but  And he goes  Well  I think you're a super guy  I go  No no no no  I'm Superman  I'm the real Superman  Okay  You go  So like  You could lift heavy things  I go  Yeah  Like  I go  It's not like  You see on TV  But yeah  I could fly  I could  You know  I could do  I could do  Whatever the fuck  You need to do  I go  The reason I don't fly a lot  Is because I don't want  To be caught by the radar  And have to go back  To my fucking planet  So he goes 
[01:48:30]  Oh so you could  You could fly here  And come visit me  Right now  I go  Yeah  If you want  I go  Not a problem  I could be there  In three minutes  You know  I'm in LA  And he goes  Okay  I want you to do that  I go  Okay  This is what I'm gonna do  And I'm only doing it  Because I love you  I'm gonna fly to New York  I go  You know what floor  You were on  In your building  Open your window  I'm gonna wave to you  And then I'm gonna come back  To LA  Pick up the phone  And you'll know  I'm telling you the truth 
[01:49:00]  So now that's a little quiet  And he's going  So you're gonna be  Outside my window  Like with the  With the red  You know  Suit  I go  No  I don't need the suit  That's just TV shit  I just fly  And I fly at the speed of light  Nobody's gonna see it  Okay  All right  The window's open  And I said  You know what  Then  I said  I just gotta tell you  You know  Only  Cause I do care about you 
[01:49:30]  Ready  I go  It's  Very shocking  When you see  Superman  I go  And  I'm just warning you  I go  See this is what I mean  This has happened before  There's a slight chance  You might get a heart attack  Cause you're not gonna believe  What you're actually seeing  Because  It's really  An unbelievable thing  So now he's like  I could get a heart attack  I go  Yeah  That's the only thing 
[01:50:00]  See that's why  I didn't want to have to  Prove it  I'd rather you  Just  In other words  You'll be outside my window  50 floors up  And I'm gonna die  To see that  I can't risk that  So now he's all fucked up  And I just hang up on him  And never told him the truth  That's an effect  Do you think he waited?  I made this guy Robert  My friend Robert  Who named me the effects master  Believed there was a two inch girl  In his dresser drawer 
[01:50:30]  Waiting to meet him  And if he likes her  I'll blow her up for him  Because I'm on the phone with him  It was raining outside  I'm in LA  He's in New York  This is how it happened  And he goes  You know what I could use  I wish I had like a beautiful  Like brunette right now  It's a rainy day  I go  Okay done  You know  And he goes  What do you mean done?  I go  Look out your window  If you like her  I'll put her in the house  You know  He goes  What do you mean look out?  I go  Look out your window  It's raining  She's getting wet  He goes  What are you talking about? 
[01:51:00]  I go  Robert  You just said to me  You want a beautiful brunette  I can do those things  So she's right there  Take a look  I'll put it  He goes  Andrew  I'm not getting up  And looking out  How the fuck would there be  A girl outside?  Now he's getting me  He's a Brooklyn guy  You know  He's going  How the fuck did you get  A girl outside my  I go  Robert  You asked for it  I didn't ask to do it  It's something you want  Something I could fucking do  Look out  I go  Where do you want her?  She's getting fucked  I go  You know what  Just open up your closet door  You know  I go 
[01:51:30]  She's standing there  Get some towels  Dry her off  You're going to love her  I promise  He goes  Andrew  I'm not getting out of my fucking bed  I don't know what the fuck you're doing  Because the guy didn't know me well  He goes  I don't know what kind of fucking game  You're playing with me  I go  Well  What do you want me to do with this fucking girl?  It's too late  You asked for her  Are you afraid of a girl?  He goes  No  How the fuck is there a girl  In my closet  He goes  You're 3,000 miles  He's actually fucking fuming  I go  Alright  This is what I'll do  Just open up your dresser drawer 
[01:52:00]  She's sitting on your underwear  I go  She's only two inches now  So you don't have to be afraid  And if you like her  I'll just blow her up to full size  And you can fuck her eyeballs out  Whatever you want to do with her  Okay  Have a good time  He goes  Andrew  I'm not opening the drawer  If I open the drawer  And there's a little fucking girl there  I'm not going to know what to do  So that's when I get to laugh  And that's when I get to enjoy my time  Destroying somebody's mind like that  And after that  He named me the effects master 
[01:52:30]  There you go  And there have been many since then  But why wouldn't he just say  No, there's not  Yeah  No, there's not what?  A girl there  Because he wouldn't look  Because if by some chance  I'm so committed to it  That if by some chance  There's a two inch girl  In your drawer  You're either going to freak out  You're insane  Or eat her  You're insane  To swallow her and forget it happened  You're insane  Did you ever do an effect like that?  No 
[01:53:00]  Alright, so now I ask the jury  You're insane  Your Honor  Ladies and gentlemen of the jury  My name is Arthur Kirkland  And I am the defending attorney  For the defendant  Jim Norton  When did I get mad?  What happened?  You're on the witness stand  Me?  Yeah  When did I get mad  About the Max thing?  I don't know  Alright, let me ask you this question 
[01:53:30]  Did it happen  At the time it happened?  I didn't feel like it was  It wasn't really discussed  Other than when that came up  The day before the gun  Honestly, I don't remember  I swear to you  I don't remember  That we ever discussed the Max thing  That's right  That's the God's honest truth  And we stayed friends  I thought so  For a couple years  Well, when was that garden show?  We're counting 99  October 2000  It was game 5  Of the Mets-Yankees World Series  On a Thursday night 
[01:54:00]  So we were friends  A couple years before that happened, right?  Two more years  And then some of the time  I was  We were off the air  And then it was the attack  When we got back on the radio  Yeah  Then I attacked  Yeah, it doesn't make sense  That one  I gotta think about for a while  It was an effect  You see what I mean?  The effect was  That I thought we were real friends  Yeah  And I truly like you  Okay  Yeah, but that's mental  No, it's an effect 
[01:54:30]  No, it's mental  And  That's mental  And you went nuts about it, right?  You went nuts back, though  Yeah  So I'm  I fueled it  I fueled the effect  And I affect you back  See the stories I just told you  About Robert  Now you're it  And about Dennis  Now you're it  That's fine  I can handle an effect  We'll do an effect  Like tag thing  Now you're it  That's fine  That's mental  I like that  Because  Someone back me up  He's insane  This guy  He's insane  I love when I drive him nuts 
[01:55:00]  You're insane  I'm just fucking with you  You're fucking insane  Donnie  Wise guy always carries his money  Never in a wallet  All right  So  Nicky was a rat  Because Sonny Black said  Nicky was a rat  Nicky was a rat  Because Sonny Black said so  Kenny's got the  It's a good one  I can't  I can't  You see a net  You see a net  And that's a good woman  I can't do right by a net  I can't do right by a net  I bet on a horse 
[01:55:30]  That horse don't do what it's supposed to do  That and every other fucking thing  In my life  Thing  We have only 10 minutes left  And they're going to turn off the computer  Yeah  You want to talk about more effects?  No  It's tiring  I love it  It's tiring  This always happens with him  Where it gets to the point  He goes  You're nuts  It's like the Raging Bull  You're really nuts  You're crazy  I do  But I do enjoy that about you  Yeah but  Yeah you're on the radio right  You make things interesting  That's for sure  Yeah exactly  And why do you think Kenny likes me?  It's interesting  But not with real life stuff 
[01:56:00]  You should have liked  You should have liked me  No I was actually angry about that  It wasn't an effect  But you know  The things with Robert  I'll summarize by saying  I completely understand  When it comes to family  Especially  That's right  And I'm very serious about that  I know family  And I understand that  But just how  But that's why  You don't understand  Because you don't have them yet  It's a whole different animal  No  But years later  That's crazy  It's not crazy  If it's what you need to do  It's just like here 
[01:56:30]  You're going to go get married  Day one is going to be fantastic  You know  And then  Then it starts falling apart  After the honeymoon  Right  Anthony  Back me up on this  Okay  No he  He was crying  I'm sorry  I'm sure your fiance  Loves me already  If she's listening  I said I had  Tears of pain and frustration  Rolling out the corner of my eye  Honeymoon night  No but this is what happens  Dude I wouldn't get married  If I didn't think it was going to  You know  The key word is  Think  We'll stay happy 
[01:57:00]  And good  Look I wish you all the luck  In the world with that  I'm not even kidding about that  I know  I know  What it is  You know  To be in love  I know what it is  You'll get married  He'll probably get married again  We'll see what happens  You almost got engaged  Or you were engaged  Yeah but I do things  To keep it exciting  That's crazy talk  But it's not crazy talk  You got engaged for what  For the goof  No not for the goof  Okay so what  It was an impulse  It was fun  But if you don't believe  In the marriage thing  Why would you do that 
[01:57:30]  I do believe in marriage  Well I believe in it  It exists  Alright  It's very hard to destroy  No but what I'm saying  Is if you're in a  In a marriage  That isn't working out  All of a sudden  Right  Sometimes it takes years  Even in a regular relationship  Years  Till it does finally end  So here comes animosity  Here comes depression  You got to be miserable  Frustration  Then you have like  A good few weeks  Or a good couple months  Or maybe even a good year together  And then it starts 
[01:58:00]  Falling apart again  And sooner or later  It ends  So what I'm bringing out  Is sometimes  What you're feeling  At the moment  Doesn't come out  For a few years  Just like  The thing with Max  So yeah  I tried to ignore it  To a certain point  And then it came out  Because he is my kid  And I do love him  And I do protect them  You know what I mean  But I'm not a chick  And when  And when  When  You don't understand that  Because you don't have kids yet 
[01:58:30]  But when you do  It becomes a whole different thing  You know  You're just protective  It's your  You're their life  You are who  Especially in this fucking world today  Where parents aren't bringing up kids  And taking care of their kids  The right way  That you got a bunch of fucking dummies  Out there  I'm making sure that my kids grow up  Knowing what to do with their lives  And guiding them  Actually guiding them  Rather than going  Just go see what happens  Right  You know what I mean  Every kid  Not every kid 
[01:59:00]  But all I hear are the stories  You know  My son didn't go to his prom  Because he goes  Dad  All they're going to do  Which he sees every day  Drinking  You know  Getting stoned  He doesn't even want to deal with that  That was a girl he liked in school  Thought she was the greatest thing  He went to a party  He goes  Dad  She was so drunk  She sickened me  You know  And just didn't want to deal  He doesn't want to deal  Like  We're not living in a day and age also  Where you could just  You know  Stick it in everything you fucking meet  You know what I mean  So he wants a nice girl 
[01:59:30]  He doesn't want  Some pig  That's just going to be  You know  Do filthy things for him  Right  Let him meet a nice girl  That'll do filthy things  You know what I mean  So you try  You try to guard your kids  What's the definition of a nice girl  If she doesn't take it into shitter  Kenny's bonding with dice  What's your memory  Why does that bother you  If we're making up  Wait a minute  If we're making up  I'm making jokes  What can I make up with Kenny  He's a little worried  I'm making jokes  He's a little worried  That you know  No I'm not  Mike Pollard already said 
[02:00:00]  He'll pick me up tomorrow  I got it right here  I'm serious  I didn't need to see it  Mike kind of sees an opportunity  He's jumping on it  Now I do have to ask you this  You swear that you weren't part of  The Howard Dead Dad jokes  It's not my thing  Okay  It's just not  Because a lot of people  Are calling me out  And like  Dude he did  He was part of that  I know you were there  Was I sitting there  Yes  No I know that much  I tried  Number one  I didn't even think  It was about you  I thought it was  Because I can't  I was defending Man Cow 
[02:00:30]  At that moment  And I'll be honest  Because a lot of people  Are saying  We'll play the audio  You know  This is going  You know what  Hold on  Hold on  This is way bigger  Than radio  What's going on today  And I can't  I personally can't hear that shit  And I don't want to hear that shit  So I gotta  I gotta take your word for it  That you weren't part of that shit  Because that's a right  Well you know what  That's something  I would swear to  As far as remembering  Right  You know  Because I just know me  I know me really well  I know when I'm fucking around  I know when I'm serious  You know  And that's just 
[02:01:00]  Not where I go  I'll say anything about you  I'll say  If I'm mad at somebody  You were extremely angry that day  And you were definitely  Taking a shot  And then Dice was definitely  I don't go there  Sorry sorry  Howard was doing his  You know  His dead dad jokes  Which is hilarious  Because he'll lose his dad someday  And then he'll maybe understand  Exactly what that's about  Not that I wish that upon anyone  And I'm being honest  That's why I don't know  No but that's what I'm saying  But you see  I'm even looking at your face  When you say  I would never go there  I tried getting you on the phone  For a long  I felt sick 
[02:01:30]  When I heard that news  Right  You know  And I knew you didn't want to talk to anybody  And you know  Pete  Well that's one of the things  That I wish I handled differently  I wish I had reached out  To a lot of people  No but I wasn't mad about it  During that time  But I shut out everyone  Understandably  You know  I can't even joke about it now  And I wouldn't  And I never would  It's just not who I am  It's not who I am  As an angry comic  It's not who I am  As a person  You know  Like I said  When you have kids  You've got to look them in the eye  I could look them in the eye  Because I know 
[02:02:00]  Nothing I do is wrong  From my stand up  To who I am as a man  To who I am as a father  I don't do the wrong thing  If I would have said something like that  About you  I couldn't look at them  That's how it is  You know  And that's what it means to me  So  I know you were taking the shots  At me personally  I took my shots  At you personally  Calling somebody a hack  Or saying they're not talented  Are you on the radio every day?  Um  But this is what I'm saying  You wouldn't be on the radio  If you weren't doing a good job 
[02:02:30]  That's it  That's the bottom line  Even if I didn't like what you did  Okay  But I was just taking shots  Because I'm angry  Just like  I fought with Howard all the years  It was  Way worse  It was awful  What we would say about each other  We made up  That's it  Because we both really like each other  Personally  And that's what it comes down to  And that's what Norton was bringing out  Yesterday  That you know  All this bullshit  You know  Fighting with  You know  Comics fighting with comics  You know  Talk show guys fighting with talk show 
[02:03:00]  It's all bullshit stuff  When  All we should really be concentrating on  Is the job  Of making people laugh  See people  The fans don't understand  What it takes  To make them laugh  You know  And  If you're just walking around  With real anger  You can't make anybody laugh  I love going up  And just  Seeing crowds  Rock back and forth  And laughter  You know  Which is  You know  Why  You know  I'm excited about doing this thing  With Norton  That he wanted me for this thing 
[02:03:30]  HBO wanted me for this thing  You know  And  Filming tomorrow and Thursday  You know  They  You know  Actually  They looked at it like  I'm doing a favor  To me  To walk out in front of the country  And make them laugh  Is not a favor  It's  It's my pleasure  Because also on shows like this  This is not about money  This isn't  About doing a gig  Where  Big paydays  They basically pay nothing  For these shows  This is about  The love  Of performing  And  You know  I started to love it again 
[02:04:00]  About three years ago  To be on stage again  And really make people laugh  And  Even  You know  The fact that  We did go through  I don't like that  You know  But I felt  I had to be honorable  To my own son  And that was it  I respect that part of it  We  We come from  A very similar place  Like I was  You don't know  Shit about me  In the last four years  I've grown as a person  Jimmy  Knows probably more than anyone  I'm not as angry  As I used to be  And  I'm having a lot of fun  Doing this again 
[02:04:30]  A lot of fun  So you understand  What I mean  I didn't have  I didn't have a lot of fun  At the end of the  NEW run  I don't know  If it was the pressure  I don't know  If it was  What was going on  And we were close  And I saw it  I don't know  If I  I was miserable  In my personal life  I don't know  If the pressure  Of what  Ant and I  Were doing  On a daily basis  Was getting to me  I wasn't having fun  I'm having a ball  Now  But you were miserable  Because our conversations  Off the air  Oh yeah  You probably knew  More than most  No I'm saying  What you were talking 
[02:05:00]  About back then  You were absorbed  In the misery  Yeah  Absolutely  At that time  I was absorbed  In misery too  So  All of a sudden  If you really got  Something going on  If you really have  That funny bone  It comes back  And you start enjoying  Being in front of the audiences  That was a time  I didn't like being  In front of them  Because I was so unhappy  So it's like  I gotta go off  They can't know that  I you know  They want to let  Now  Put on the face

[03:15:30]  I've had  I've had  this whole demo recut.  I'm not stupid.  Oh, he cut out all of his boo-boo-boos.  I say another sec.  He cut his what out?  Mickey J was a...  He cut out his boo-boo-boos?  No, I didn't.  Why does Steve like Betty Davis?  I don't know.  What?  We've been making fun of him for a week  and we didn't come up with the Betty Davis line.  Wait a minute.  Speaking of people that should cut out boo-boo-boos,  where's Danny?  Holy shit.  Yeah, he decided to cut 
[03:16:00]  his...  I don't know.  He went to trim his eyebrows  and the trimmer wasn't set right  so he cut it off.  Holy Jesus.  Yeah, I whacked my whole...  I whacked one eyebrow off  because I wasn't paying attention  to how low the trimmer was set  and then the other one was full  and then I had no eyebrow  and a full eyebrow  so I just whacked the other one off.  Is that what made you wear  a high-water shirt?  Yes.  Yes.  Jesus, it's almost a fucking blouse.  Well, I do have a history  of wearing blouses.  It's all off the top.  You know what?  Hold on, boss.  Anthony, write a parody  about his eyebrows.

Gradually.  Bob, oh God.  That was brutal.  I say one more second.  One more?  Yeah, one more second.  Mickey J was drunk from Montauk  and ended up dying. 
[03:17:00]  Drowning, yeah.  That guy's dead now.  He's dead.  Hope you're hot.  WB...  You know what?  This is...  I don't think we've ever made it this far.  No, I think this is officially the furthest we've gotten into this, I think.  We've tried like six or seven times before this.  WBAB, the 70s, best rock.  I should start talking like a DJ, man. 
[03:17:30]  Jethro Tull.  You have to start talking like a DJ.  You've been doing it for six years.  Jesus.  What the fuck do you mean?  What do you mean?  A DJ?  You mean Voss?  A dumb Jew?  You should have just done successful in that statement.  This motherfucker has been like a hundred and...  Oh, wow.  Attitude.  That's a good one, Voss, dude.  Painful.  Otto, what are you doing?  Dreaming of fucking George? 
[03:18:00]  What?  He's just looking in the distance like, I miss George.  I wonder what kind of sandwiches he's eating without me.  Fucking, what are you doing?  Why didn't you bring George?  You were scared Bobby would eat him?  Anthony would try to fucking suck his cock.  Come on, George.  Let's go to the sink.  I'm going to teach you what my dad taught me, son.  It's called the fountain.  It's coming in too many times.  Everyone's saying that we miss Voss saying altar top. 
[03:18:30]  Oh.  Did I say that?  Did you?  Might have.  I don't know.  Might have.  Well, the H is silence.  No.  How did that...  This was weird.  Well, it's Opie in the Nighttime Attitude.  Just want to remind you quickly, tomorrow is Friday, and we're still looking for your suggestions  for the perfect lunch hour, the Friday thematic perfect lunch hour.  Tomorrow's topic, songs about school.  You can fax your suggestions at 422-1023.  1-0-2-3.  Okay, Sally.

[03:19:30]  Next week we'll have a juggling painter.  God damn it, Bobby.  Why did you have to mention Subway?  I know.  The one thing you can't get on.  What does that mean?  You're too mean.  The Subway.  Bobby, can we end this before?  There's no...  Sally?  They're telling us we have to go.  Yeah, yeah.  Who is that?  Who's telling you, Sally?  Just the imaginary person has told us we have to get out of here. 
[03:20:00]  And don't forget, this weekend we'll be at the...  This weekend we'll be at the Rainy Night House.  Those are all Long Island clubs.  Nobody knows that.  And in the studio live tonight.  I mean, they've been doing so much cool stuff for my show, I thought I owed it to them to bring them in live.  It's Rotka.  Thank you very much.  We got a...  Someone called in before and requested a reggae song.  We don't know many.  All right.  We know one reggae song.  It's a pale reggae song.  Very pale.  Give it a whirl.  Let's check it out.  Don't we have to leave? 
[03:20:30]  And Tuesday, Bob Nelson will be calling in.  It's a story of a lovely lady.  Who was bringing the crowd.  The crowd's groaning.  Because there were such lovely girls.  All of them had hair of black.  Just like their mama.  The youngest one in Dresden.  That's the truth.  It's a story.  Of a man named Brady. 
[03:21:00]  Who was busy with dreamers.  You sound like Peter Todd's assy being shot.  The rest of the time.  Very busy people.  There were four men living all together.  Like a Jamaican with a hearing problem.  And they all get stoned.  The Brady Blunts.  A little fart to go.  The Brady Blunts.  The Brady and the Brady Blunts.  The doctor, we became a Brady Blunts. 
[03:21:30]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You know, Jeff Norris was in the car going, I could do this.  Hey, we've got something to add to the program tonight.  9-5-5.  Help.  Help.  By the way, I've got a surprise.  We're going to end this show in style today.  Once again, help.  That's all I can say.  Because someone else just called.  Help.  Anything at all.  I'll let the Canada know.  Anybody out there?  Help.  All right.  That's good.  That's a very good hint, by the way.  Jeez.  Help.  By the Brady Blunts.  Shut up, Jimmy.  What about the Brady Blunts?  Shut up.  How about the unfunny cunts? 
[03:22:00]  He really did.  Wow.  He really did.  That was the apology call, too.  I'll also apologize for that one.  I just went.  Jimmy, what was the Chunky Monkey ice cream flavor that you had?  Oh, when I was just starting out, I said that in Connecticut, that they were very ritzy.  And they wouldn't eat Chunky Monkey.  They would eat obese primate.  And then you said.  I just wanted to feel how it felt.  And then you said, Mr. Levy, can I give you a ride home now? 
[03:22:30]  Where is it?  Where is it?  That was the beginning of Norton's evolution of I'll hold on to him for real.  If you had hands that worked, you would, too.  Get those turtle feet away from me.  Fucking doll hands.  All right, listen.  He really does have spider monkey hands.  He really does.  Give him tape a mic to his little stupid hand.  Those hands should be throwing his own shit. 
[03:23:00]  Oh, fuck.  At least my hands knew how to wash my own body when I was a kid.  That's true.  That's it.  At least no one had to teach my hands how to wash myself.  Now when are they going to learn to write?  Wow.  Listen, we really do have to go.  My throat hurts from laughing.  We have to go.  They're going to shut us off.  They're going to play about 20 minutes of commercials and then start up Ron and Fez.  That was great.  Right?  11.40.  We have to be off the air? 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  Oh, thank you so much.  Thank you.  Wow, what a great first show.  Hopefully we can keep it up for another day.  Oh, Jimmy's going to show his ass.  They're liking your ass, Jimmy.  Yeah, who doesn't?  So hairless.  Wow, Anthony sores his ass and wants to take his shower.  Now I know what dad saw.  A hairless little ass like Jimmy has.  Guys, thank you for the support.  We appreciate it.  Hey, it's Mark Maron from the WTF Podcast. 
[03:24:00]  I'm also hosting this.  This thing I'm doing now.  Opie and Anthony Listener Request Show.  This is it.  More of your picks and requests are coming up after the break.  Ladies and gentlemen, fresh from their recent string of shows in Vienna,  presenting the Seth Rogen Tabernacle Choir.  We'll be right back. 
[03:24:30]  Worst of, 877-496-7786.  And get your favorite bits on the air.  Hey, folks. 
[03:25:00]  Mark Maron here, host of the WTF Podcast.  It's available on iTunes and at WTFPod.com.  Go there.  Stand updates.  Everything's there.  Shirts.  Get the app.  Whatever.  That's not the point of this.  I'm doing the Opie and Anthony Listener Request Show.  Call 877-4.  That's the number four.  Worst of.  Or 877-496-7786.  And maybe that shit that only you seem to remember will get played.  Yeah.  That'll happen.  Let's see what's next. 
[03:25:30]  The listener requests voicemail.  Next message.  Hey, boys.  It's Sean from Bloomsburg, a.k.a.  Ross Daddy on Whack Bag.  I'd like to request that you dig up a fucking relic from a while back known as deaf karaoke.  It was heartless, mean-spirited, insensitive to the deaf community.  So, for all of that, I can't just like it.  I love it.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that I called in during it either.  Punch it out.  Message deleted.  We've got so much to do. 
[03:26:00]  I don't know where to go.  Where do you want to go?  You want to-  Ah, just grab something, throw it in, and we'll laugh at it.  All right.  It is a weird, like, slow news day.  We took care of the politics.  We took care of the golf is not a sport.  It was good.  We took care of, like, pot talk in general today.  A lot of pot talk today.  Where you talk like you're on pot, not talking about pot.  I understand that.  Well, she makes it really easy for us, and we try, we really try to not go here. 
[03:26:30]  But this time around, we can't help ourselves.  Karen Meyer is back.  Karen Meyer.  Love her.  We can't get enough of Karen Meyer, but we kind of think, in a way, it might be too easy and too mean.  But, you know, when she's doing something called Crip Slam Sundays, it is our job to play the audio.  What is it?  Crip Slam Sundays.  Karen Meyer, of course, she's a news, a news who-er from Chicago.  Jesus, you're trying to be nice?  A news who-er. 
[03:27:00]  She does the, like, little human interest disabled stories.  Well, she's deaf, and she's on the news.  She's deaf.  Which is just amazing to me.  It's amazing to me.  They have to run subtitles under her reports, because you really can't understand what she's saying.  See, if Karen Meyer is allowed to do the news, then I should be allowed to just play on the PGA Tour.  Yeah, why not?  Why not?  Like, why is she on the news?  Except for the fact it's something people talk about, and it's a freak show. 
[03:27:30]  It's a gimmick.  It's a gimmick.  A lot of these people have style.  She has substance.  It's a gimmick.  How do you know if she has substance?  You can't even understand what she's saying.  You have to read.  She makes you have to read the news.  That's right.  If I wanted to read the news, I'd pick up the New York Times.  You're going to have to read Pan's Labyrinth.  You're going to have to read-  You had to read-  I'm not reading-  Downfall.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Das Boot.  Guess what?  Das Boot.  Read it.  Decide not to read those films.  Just because she said, where are we quitting? 
[03:28:00]  You have to understand she means Hillary.  Oh.  Mama, mama, mama.  You have to understand that it's Barack Obama.  All you got to do is listen to her.  Listen with your heart and not with your ears.  She's making a mockery of us broadcasters.  How about that?  What you, Opie?  She's making a mockery of the business.  Is that going through?  Is that going through, Al?  What do you say, Al?  What do you say, Al? 
[03:28:30]  That make it through?  What do you say, Al?  Al.  I woke up, Opie.  That's a judgment call that Al's going to have to make.  What do you say, Al?  He has no idea.  He's throwing his arms up in the air.  I don't know.  It kind of sounded like it, I guess, with a W.  What does she do a story on? 
[03:29:00]  It's a Crip Slam Sunday.  She does the disability stories.  I don't know what Crip Slam Sunday is.  We're going to find out here.  No, we're not.  Is that anything?  Oh, yeah.  I would love to know.  Is that anything like Blood Slam Tuesday?  Yeah.  I'm thinking the Crips.  Is it the Crips?  She's kind of ripping us off.  Tell them, Fred, who, who, who.  Because back in the day, we started a thing called Crip Bouts.  Ah, yes.  Cripple Fights.  Cripple Fights.  And we want to call it Crip Bouts.  And someone reminded us that maybe you shouldn't show favoritism to the Crips. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  And we're saying, no, Crips as in cripples, but I guess it was too close and it got people  nervous.  So we changed it into, what, Cripple Bouts or something like that?  Something like that.  All right.  Well, she's doing Crip Slam Sundays.  Well, it's live performances by people with disabilities about disabilities.  All right.  See, you're right.  We had to go here now.  I got to hear this.  This is like people performing and they have disabilities and their performances are based 
[03:30:00]  on their disabilities.  Correct.  Oh, I love this.  Remember this city.  Nothing better than a comic with CP or something that goes up.  Remember this city.  Oh, my.  My.  My.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's despicable.  And I want to hear every moment of it.  All right.  Here's Karen Meyer.  She's out of Chicago, by the way.  It's the minor countdown.  Why does it have to be a bad 80s song, by the way? 
[03:30:30]  That's all they hear.  They don't know what new music is.  Because that was the last time they heard.  I get it.  They're deaf now.  Oh, God.  Come on.  Come on. 
[03:31:00]  Come on.  I mean, I swear, I mean, I mean, someone do Kajigugu, please.  Nah, do, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, are you watching?  I can't tell.  Hach, Hach, did you watch? 
[03:31:30]  Are you by the mind?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Mock night and then day, day, day.  Mock night and then day, day.  Hey, man, if Mondays were deaf karaoke night, who wouldn't go?  Who wouldn't go?  And I'm by the mind, no way home.  It's all the line like it's at the end of the damn thing that don't have that day.  I don't know.  I can't hear them. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my ears are sealed.  My ears are sealed.  You spin me.  Frankie said, I don't know. 
[03:32:30]  I told you, get me up. 
[03:33:00]  Can you do a tainted love, please?  That's when it hits the table.  Yeah, one of the old bad 80s songs. 
[03:33:30]  Wait, I got one here.  This is an actual deaf person singing a song from back in the day.  Yeah.  I got a new life.  You would hardly recognize me.  I'm so glad I'm new.  I got one here. 
[03:34:00]  Fancy talk.  Fancy talk, Ross, work.  I saw the sign  It opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  You'll do what we tell you to do, you dirty, low-down struts  I saw the sign  It opened up my eyes  I saw the sign  No one's gonna drag you up  To get into the light where you belong  And it feels you'll be lost  Hey, I smell a bit, yes, of course 
[03:34:30]  My job is to say I smell a bit  We should do deaf karaoke on the O'Brien Anthony show  Is there any way we can make people completely deaf  Where they can't hear themselves?  Of course, yeah  I mean, earplugs and all that  But we gotta go a lot further than that  No, because you kind of still hear it resonating in your head  That's the problem  You can't even hear that  Oh, really? That's the difference?  Ice pick into the ears if anybody wants to do it  I think the lawyers will frown upon it  I wanna be 
[03:35:00]  No, you just know  Because you already know what you sound like  That's why  That's why deaf people talk like that  No, no, no  Na, na, na  Na, na, ma  Na, na, na  Na, na, na  Na, na, na  It's really all I can tell to you  Na, na  I wanna meet  What?

[03:36:30]  Tell the son  What happened today  The people are always  Defensive against  The thing that  The people  His son will probably  Be rolling  Yeah  If he  If he could  No, what happens  Then he wouldn't be deaf  99 Luftballons  And deaf is not funny  When you do  A show like ours  The problem is  Everyone laughs  Until it hits  Too close to home  And then it's like  Hey, I enjoy  Everything else you guys do  Exactly  But  The deaf thing  Not funny  Because I got  My son's a sissy swimmer  My son is deaf 
[03:37:00]  He's like  Alright, we get it  I'm diabetic  You still eat cookies  Alright, let's go to Dom  I couldn't hear it  Through the grapevine  I couldn't hear it  Through the grapevine  Let's go to Dom  In Jersey  Dom  Hey, what's up guys  Love you  Hey  Hey, I wanted to hear  What a  Don't worry you got  On Mr. Roboto  Would sound like  It probably would sound  The same  Yeah, no, no  No, no  No, no  No, no  No, no  No, no  No, no  No, no  No, no  No, no  It's so stupid 
[03:37:30]  That's why  It really is  It ain't even  About deaf people  It's just  It's so stupid  Just singing bad songs badly  I'm not ready to give up  On this idea  We got Pete in Boston  Pete, what's up?  That's Keith  Alright, Keith  What's up?  Maybe I'm deaf  You can get the same sound  If you do  Novocaine karaoke  Hmm  Oh, dead in the mouth  You know something  How do we  Dead in the mouth?  Legally  We need a licensed  Dentist  With Novocaine  To just shoot it 
[03:38:00]  Into people's mouths  That's what they sell  Over the counter  To make your mouth numb  Nah, that doesn't work  As good  I'm talking that  When they gotta work  On your bottom teeth  And they hit that nerve  Right at the jawbone  Where it just deadens  Half your face  Do it to both sides  And then have them  Sing karaoke  Yeah  You'll be wishing  You didn't do it  Oh, is that great?  Oh, man  Let's say hi to  Carlin in Massachusetts  Carlin, what's up?  Hey, you mentioned  Deaf Karaoke 
[03:38:30]  There's actually a bar  In Quincy, Mass  That has a deaf rapper  On karaoke night  Oh, wow  We need audio  We need audio  I'll see what I can  Pull off the board  But I mean  The guy starts  And goes like  Two minutes past  The end of the song  Because he just  Has no idea  He comes up  With his own lyrics  Just curses people out  And it has nothing  To do with the song  That he picked up  Up the police  Up the police  What do you say, Al?  Al  A lot of judgment 
[03:39:00]  Calls today, huh, Al?  Let's go to  Pedro in Brooklyn  Pedro  Pedro  Hey, O.N., good morning  Did you  Wait, what's the line again at?

Hi, uh  Let me just  Go with this  And punch out  I did 
[03:39:30]  I did  I did  I really  I really  I really  I really  I really  I really  I really  I really  I really  I really  I really  More retarded  Than deaf  But good  Good  Thank you  Very good  And I can't believe  You didn't know  Sledgehammer  Oh, that was  Oh, B  Oh, yeah  I'm on the main  I'm on  What?  That is just so wrong  Someone's suggesting  Well, Rochester  Check it in finally  Rapper's delight there  All W's whip-wop 
[03:40:00]  Is this what her story's about, by the way?  Oh, I forgot  Is it any  Is it even resembling what we're doing here?  What were we talking about?  Oh, yeah  We were talking about a little bit  We want to do a cold break  How do you know my  How do you know the tongue?  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey 
[03:40:30]  Hey, you know that stuff you put on your teeth  When you're  You got a tooth pain?  You put it all over your tongue  Ambasol, huh?  Hello  Like Ambasol  We heard you  Were you deaf?  You can put that stuff all over your tongue  And it'll do the same exact thing as an overcame  I was all upset that we didn't hear him  Hello  Hello  I have something to say here  And we were answering you and talking to you  You're a douche  Well, Gooch is always good for one 
[03:41:00]  Gooch in Cleveland, what's up?  Oh, Mickey, what a penny  You don't understand  I don't know why it's got to be the awful 80s tunes  It just works better that way  Oh, yeah  It all works like  The songs are just awful  Well, this might work  I like that I had no clue what it was until the chorus 
[03:41:30]  Let's go to  It looks like Cameron  Yep, that's me  Because everyone spells Cameron  C-A-M-O-R-N  Camorne  That could mean one thing  Craig is on the phones today 
[03:42:00]  What's up, Camorne?  I got an idea  If you have a chubby bunny karaoke  Chubby bunny karaoke  Do we have any marshmallows?  Yeah, let's  I guess that does make sense  I mean, they could shove in their ears  E-Rock  Throw some marshmallows in your mouth  And see if you can sing some  Bad 80s song  We want to see if this will work  We'll test it out  Certainly taking our chances  With the E-Rock marshmallow a bit  Good point  Debbie, Rhode Island  What's up?  Have him sing 
[03:42:30]  She blinded me with science  Oh, wow  Just sing it regularly  But have the deaf people  Just make the sound  Oh, boy 
[03:43:00]  We got  That's what they're doing  All the noises  They're not the moment  They're beautiful  Oh, my God  They do all the noises, too 
[03:43:30]  Wait a minute  If they're going to do them  I'm going to go  Too good  Too good  Too good  I do that  I do that  I do that  I do that  I do that  It smells stupid  All right, we got a dentist checking in  We're not giving up on this bit yet  Jay, the dentist 
[03:44:00]  What's up?  What's going on, guys?  Hey  I heard y'all talking about getting the bottom teeth numb  You get the tongue numb on that side of the face when you do it  So if you numb up both sides of the face  Well, we want to do this legally, sir  That's legal  What's that?  That's legal  I don't know how ethical it would be for a dentist to administer Novocaine for a contest  But I couldn't see it being illegal  Oh, it's not illegal  Not at all  I don't see any problem  Could be a drastic tongue-biting incident that might 
[03:44:30]  Hell, let's get a dentist to do this for us  Yeah  Yep  As long as they sign the papers and stuff  I don't see any problems  Right  See, that's  There's another show that said  As long as the releases are signed, we're fine  You're damn right  All right, thanks, guys  Isn't there a part of the brain we can just push Novocaine into that would numb the entire head?  Can't we just hit him on the side of that with a ball-peen hammer?  I think so far marshmallows is  Marshmallows  But they can choke 
[03:45:00]  All right, listen  We'll get into the Karen Meyer story, I guess  That's where it all came from  She's in Chicago, deaf reporter on the news  And she does this thing called Crip Slam Sundays  We'll have some audio from that next  Oh, bitch, it's poetry  Poetry?  Yeah, they call it  Oh, slam  Yeah, it could be  I bet it's poetry  Well, it's all sorts of different disabilities, though  And they have to use their disabilities in an artistic way  Crip slam 
[03:45:30]  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America  Talking about deaf karaoke  Patrice brought up a very interesting point  That they just know 80s songs for whatever reason  Yeah, for some reason  I don't know why  A lot of people are saying  A lot of people are saying  We should use hot sauce and numb the tongue  And then we can do deaf karaoke  I don't think it works as good as Novocaine  That's for sure  That's why we have the O.P. and Anthony Institute  The O.P. and Anthony Labs 
[03:46:00]  We'll try out some things  And we'll bring it to you in the very near future  We experiment  But a lot of people only want to hear one more song  And they're saying, you know  Queen  Uh  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

[03:50:00]  The best part was when he slowed it down.  Well, the end gets very calm.  Nothing really matters. 
[03:50:30]  Oh, yeah, that's a classic.  Me, me, me, me. 
[03:51:00]  What?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wait, this is so obscure. 
[03:51:30]  Oh, Wes.  Oh, you don't know that.  Remember Flash Gordon?  They did the whole thing.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, there are some obscure ones.  Oh, wow.  Oh, God.  Oof.  Let's say hi to Ken in Jersey.

No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no.

[03:54:30]  Joe.  Don't.  Don't think of you.  Oh, I will always know.  Stand with me.  Fucking hell.  Ah.  Ah, that's horrible.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God. 
[03:55:00]  That's your name.  Stop it.  No way.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I know what it is.  Why?  I know what song it is.  Stop the song.  What song?  Baby, I love you.  No.  It's a bit of an M and D.  Oh.  It sounds like.  I know you made me.  I love you. 
[03:55:30]  Really?  Absolutely.  I'm thinking Patience.  No.  Baby, I love what that song is.  Or a little Poison or something.  You know, baby, I love what that song is.  Oh, my man.  M and D.  Did I start over?  Zero.  That's what song it is.  We've been trying to figure this out for.  This is a deaf person.  I was listening to it.  It's on YouTube.  Let's do music.  Let's do music.  I can't hear that. 
[03:56:00]  No, no.  You got to keep going.  I am.  I'm just stopping for a second.  Someone else is saying knocking on heaven's door.  Knock, knock, knock.  No.  No, that's not enough repetition there.  It's Baby, I love.  Whatever that song is.  Baby, I love.  I don't even know what that song is.  You got to listen to the chorus. 
[03:56:30]  Yes.  That's a bit of music.  That's a bit of music.  What the hell is that? 
[03:57:00]  I'm not sold on Baby, I Love Your Way.  I'm not sold on it, Patrice.  I might be wrong.  I don't know what that is.  Do we know what song that is?  I'm thinking it's Baby, I Love Your Way.  I thought I had it.  Wow.  I have no idea.  It might not be it because I was waiting for the chorus, but I'm listening to the music.  It has a Guns N' Roses unplugged sound. 
[03:57:30]  Is he playing his own guitar?  Does it?  At all?  Well, the guitar.  The guitar is very generic.  Just kind of bloomed and a couple of chords and you're just...  The power ballad of the 80s.  Yeah.  It's got to be some kind of 80s song, no?  Let's go to Lou.  What's up, Lou?  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, what's up, man?  I was wondering what it would sound like if Horatio from CSI was deaf.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:58:00]  Dumb.  Yeah, that's what it would sound like.  All you'd hear.  There'd be no funny little statement, nothing.  All right.  Dan, what's up?  It seemed to me, Bank, I didn't hear a word you did.  What's up, buddy?  I believe I can play.  I believe I can play.  People just enjoy doing it.  I don't know why.  I don't know what's so fun about doing it.  All right. 
[03:58:30]  Just this.  Someone else is saying it's knocking on heaven's door.  Paul, Staten Island, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  It's definitely knocking on heaven's door.  You can hear knocking on heaven's door in there?  Maybe not the chorus.  But not the chorus, though.  That's what I'm saying is a chorus.  Oh, someone might have the answer.  Thank you, Paul.  I'm thinking knocking on heaven's door myself until I saw this.  Greg, what's up?  Angie from the Rolling Stones. 
[03:59:00]  That's what it sounds like.  Is the guitar work Angie?  No, it doesn't sound like that.  Yeah, because he would be screaming.  Let's hear it one more time.  Angie, let me hear it.  I doubt it.  I like that version better anyway.  All right, here it is again.  Someone else is saying Wild Horses by the Stones. 
[03:59:30]  Take it to the Institute and pitch it down.  All right.  That is a mystery. 
[04:00:00]  It doesn't sound like any of the songs.  It sounds like it could be like ten different songs.
