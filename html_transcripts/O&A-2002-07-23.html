<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with a comedic song about animal cruelty, transitioning into listener calls and promotion of their upcoming party featuring the Crystal Method.  A significant portion focused on the "WOW Contest," specifically scrutinizing contestant #128, suspected of being a man in drag.  The Crystal Method (Ken and Scott) appeared in-studio, participating in the infamous "Flaming Dr. Pepper" shots (amaretto, Kahlua, and Bacardi 151 ignited and dropped into beer) alongside the hosts and long-time, soon-to-retire engineer Pete, who provided humorous contrast due to his age.  The party preparations involved extensively discussing the selection and attire of several scantily-clad women.  Offensive language and crude humor were prevalent throughout this initial segment.

The party itself, celebrating the Crystal Method's "Community Service" CD, became the central focus of a later segment.  The Crystal Method performed live outside, accompanied by dancing women in revealing clothing, further fueling the show's focus on their attractiveness.  Lewis Black and Devin Rattray ("Buzz" from *Home Alone*) joined the studio party, adding to the chaotic atmosphere fueled by copious amounts of Flaming Dr. Peppers.  Recurring jokes involved pressuring "Ecstasy Pete" to drink, his reluctance stemming from his impending retirement.  Discussions veered wildly, encompassing the Pope's youth convention appearance and declining health (including a humorous anecdote about accidentally punching a youth), the Catholic Church's declining popularity, the exorbitant wealth of corporate executives (specifically mentioning WorldCom), and persistent, often crude, attempts to convince Lewis Black to participate in a "stump shot" (a tequila shot from a one-legged woman's prosthetic leg), eventually succeeded in by Devin Rattray.  The entire segment was characterized by highly vulgar and sexually suggestive language, excessive drinking, and raucous behavior.

A subsequent segment heavily featured the "stump shot," involving a guest, Emma, and her prosthetic leg.  Discussions centered on the leg's smell and texture, alongside a clip about Ted Williams' frozen head and the ensuing discussion of his son's actions. Opie's recent appearance on ESPN's *More Sports* as a WNBA stalker was discussed, along with a $100 bet on a female guest's height, left unresolved.  Lewis Black accidentally set his arm on fire during a Flaming Dr. Pepper mishap, and multiple body shots were taken from various guests. The segment showcased a highly informal atmosphere with crude humor and offensive language.

The broadcast concluded with a comedically disastrous attempt to measure the height of a female caller.  Opie and Anthony, along with Lewis Black and the Crystal Method, employed increasingly absurd and profane methods, rejecting conventional techniques.  The measuring process involved lying on the studio console and using a Sharpie to mark height, fueling arguments about cheating and slouching.  Jamaican Mike accidentally set his hand on fire during a Flaming Dr. Pepper incident.  Callers, including Tony from Philly and Foz (with Kim Monroe, their program director), contributed to the chaos.  The segment ended with plugs for guests' projects and listener-submitted "what I learned today" segments.  Vulgar language and sexually suggestive comments were prevalent.

[00:06:00]  Outside of New York City.  Including Cleveland!  Cleveland!  We talked about it  a little bit yesterday.  Cleveland giving us  monstrous ratings yesterday.  Thank you once again  to Cleveland.  Thank you, Cleveland.  We're working on  putting something together.  Give us a little time,  but we'll figure it out,  Cleveland, all right?  Yes, Jim.  Monstrous wasn't  a good word for you?  It was a great word.  I want to know  why Francine is dressed  like Boom Boom Washington.  Ah!  Yeah, you're wearing 
[00:06:30]  that Jiffy Pop hat.  You don't like it?  No, it's very ghetto.  Looks like you should be  one of Al Sharpton's hoes.  It is.  It's very ghetto.  And a drug buzz.  You don't see white chicks  wearing hats like that.  Oh, thank you.  No way.  It's my own personal style.  That's pretty cool.  It's like a denim hat.  It's a rerun.  Used to wear a hat like that,  I believe.  Looks like you should be  roller skating.  Yeah.  You look like something  J.J. painted.  Right, a J.J. painting.  Wow.  From good times.  What was the episode of, 
[00:07:00]  what was the roller skating episode?  Was it on Chips?  It was on Chips.  It was on Chips.  The roller skating episode.  Roller boogie episode of Chips.  Where all the various  cast from a lot of these shows  that were on the same network  as Chips  made guest appearances  on roller skates.  And now,  remember the announcer?  And making his way  out onto the floor,  it's Dick Van Patten.  Dick Van Patten.  And there's Dick Van Patten  trying to stand up  on roller skates.  It was horrible.  Here comes Grizzly Adams. 
[00:07:30]  Grizzly Adams.  Whatever his name was.  It's a douche chill,  this episode of Chips,  but so bad.  Did Dick Van Patten  come out with Andrea Yates  because they starred  in Five is Enough?  Oh my God.  So for Cleveland  and everyone else  outside of New York City,  866-277-4WOW.  That's 866-277-4WOW.  Hi.  Hi, this is Stinky Garrett.  I'm calling you.  You said you were  coming to the party. 
[00:08:00]  Okay, I'm just confirming this.  Stinky.  All right, so you're showing up?  Okay.  Hi, this is Stinky Garrett.  This is what we had  here in the office.  Oh, in the office.  Over and over again.  Hi.  He had his huge folder out  with all the names  and phone numbers  of the girls  that said they were  coming to the party today.  Our big party  with the crystal method  happening today.  What a setup  we got out there.  It looks great.  There are lasers.  There's lasers.  All kinds of things.  I mean, you step out there,  you're going to have  one of those Pokemon  cartoon seizures. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, there's a video screen  set up and lasers  and I think they got  a smoke machine  they want to turn on.  Nice.  They do.  They're going to turn  the smoke machine on.  Hi.  Are you showing up?  Hi.  And then one girl goes,  Well, I could come Friday.  Weren't you listening?  The party's Tuesday,  you idiot.  Get Stinky in here  because he was getting frustrated.  I think he called  a couple of the girls whores.  Stupid whores.  You're stupid whores.  One girl said  she could show up Friday  like, all right, 
[00:09:00]  we'll just not do this today  and do it Friday.  What was going on out there?  What was going on  in the back office, I mean?  On the phones  when you're calling the girls?  Since we didn't have  that many girls,  I was calling girls  we didn't talk to on the air  and they completely forgot  that they even entered  and they're like,  well, I could come down Friday  but the party's Tuesday.  Jackass.  We, uh,  I think we're going to need  more hot girls.  Hot girls.  Hot girls.  I think I might have  blew it last week.  Open that door up,  Stinky, for a minute. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, the music stopped?  Yeah, there is.  I was hoping the music  would be gone.  We could kind of get  the party sound  and some of the girls  are hearing,  oh, they really are  having a party.  So if there's hot girls  in the area,  come on by.  Now, we're giving up  the whole criteria here  or are we going to have it like,  we'll have it like  Studio 54.  We need a velvet rope  set up  and we will turn people away.  I only have one rule,  Anthony.  What?  As long as you don't  look like contestant  number 128  in the WOW Contest,  you're invited  to the Crystal Method Party. 
[00:10:00]  Ah, well,  didn't you say  we just want girls?  That's what I'm saying.  As long as you don't  look like that.  There's a lot of  controversy brewing  over the WOW Contest.  By the way,  our webmaster,  Scott,  who's back from vacation.  Thank God.  The qualifying is over,  as we all know by now,  right?  Yeah.  He's got to put about  12 new girls up  on opianthony.com  then we can finally  start the voting.  Then that's it.  All the girls.  These girls all got  their pictures done last week  but Scott wasn't around  to put their pictures  up on the website.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  No more qualifying. 
[00:10:30]  No.  One of the girls up there  contested number 128  Madison from Vegas.  There is something going on.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is,  I am,  I'm saying it.  We've been studying the picture  for a good half hour  in the back office  just getting everyone's  opinions and stuff  and that has to be a dude.  That is a man.  Has to be a dude.  It's a man.  I mean,  all the signs are there  for a man.  We have an Adam's apple.  We have what seems to be  some type of stubble  on the face. 
[00:11:00]  We have a man's face.  We have breast implants  that look like they,  there were no breasts  there before.  Right.  It's just stretching the skin  to its limit.  It looked like the doctor  had nothing to work with.  Big hands.  Very big,  long fingers.  And man hips.  The hips aren't girl hips.  I am saying,  for the record,  contestant 128 Madison  from Vegas  is indeed  a gentleman.  A man. 
[00:11:30]  If she listens to this show,  she,  he,  it,  needs to give us a call  immediately.  Contestant number 128,  okay?  Look at the dark  razor stubble there.  Look at the Adam's apple.  Hey man,  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  Look at the lack  of womanly hips.  I think this picture  is even better,  Keith.  You could totally see  a big Adam's apple.  Look at that.  Look at that. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah,  take a look for yourself.  Opie and Anthony.com,  contestant number 128.  We got problems with.  All right?  Man hands.  Anthony,  something else is happening  outside that's pretty funny.  Yeah.  Two worlds are kind of  colliding out there.  We got Pete,  the engineer,  who's retiring  in less than a year.  Hi.  He's been with this radio station  in New York  for over 40 years.  Mm-hmm.  And then we got  the young,  hip dudes,  you know,  setting up  Crystal Methods stuff.  Right.  The turntables and things.  The lights.  And Pete doesn't understand  that they don't need  to plug guitars in. 
[00:12:30]  Where did the guitars go?  And drums and keyboards.  It's like,  no, Pete,  they use turntables and stuff.  We have turntables  in the studio.  That's how they used  to play the music here  back in the old days  when I was only here  for 25 years.  So he's freaking out?  Yeah,  he doesn't really  understand what's going on.  That we're just setting up  two turntables  out there,  basically.  Where's your electric guitar?  Where's the electric guitar?  Don't need one.  The turntables. 
[00:13:00]  Where do I plug  in the microphones?  Where's the microphones?  Back in Vaudeville.  And I think the light show  out there  is freaking him out, too, eh?  Yeah.  He's all freaked out.  He's having a Pokemon seizure.  Did he bring some glow sticks  and E?  He's like,  this looks like  Love American style.  Is that what he said?  That's like the reference  he knows is something groovy.  That's the closest reference  he can get to something  cool, hip, and groovy.  This is like  Love American style.  Love, love, love. 
[00:13:30]  Love American style.  So, there you have it.  Any of the girls  show up for the party yet?  Yeah, we got like six out there.  Oh, we do.  We were convinced  we were getting one girl  to sit here  petrified for her life.  Are they outside,  outside, or upstairs?  I guess they're just  finishing up paperwork  and getting wandered  and all that stuff.  Now, are they worthy  of the strict guidelines  that we had put  on these girls?  Some of them, uh...  Some of them? 
[00:14:00]  How did some slip through?  Did they lie?  I think they're all cute.  All right.  Oh, boy.  We got problems?  No, that's not a problem  if they're cute.  Who has seen these girls?  Stinky has seen these girls.  Stinky is brutally honest,  and I love him for that.  Get Stinky back in here.  Get young Garrett  back in here.  I walked through the hall.  They were good-looking girls.  Yeah, all right.  They should be supermodels.  No, we weren't.  You eliminated supermodels.  Yeah, your criteria  didn't allow for supermodels.  Your 5'8", maximum height. 
[00:14:30]  They should be natural,  normal girls  that look like supermodels.  That's what I was going for.  I think natural,  normal girls  that look cute  and because they're  supposed to be young.  Yeah, very much  girl next door,  very cute.  Cute?  A lot better  than Money Snatch.  Oh, well, I hope so.  The guys  sitting in this studio  right now  are better than  the chicks  from Money Snatch.  Thanks.  Horrid.  Horrid.  You have nothing  bad to say, Stinky?  A lot?  There's like  eight girls here  and they're all very cute.  Cute.  Are they wearing  their little outfits yet? 
[00:15:00]  Not really.  I don't know.  Did they bring some?  I would be very angered  if they did not bring  appropriate  little  pajama party wear.  Get some of the girls together.  We're going to bring them in.  Yeah, let's see  what they look like.  Hook them up.  I've got to go to  Derek in Buffalo.  Derek, what's going on?  Stop toying with yourself, Jim.  Jesus.  Derek.  Hey, O&A.  What's going on?  What's up, Derek?  Well, they finally printed  a good article about you  in a Buffalo paper.  Oh, yeah?  There's another article  about our Buffalo appearance? 
[00:15:30]  Yeah, a guy actually went there  and he was a fan of yours  so he printed it up  in Nightlife Magazine.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Was that the guy  that was in the VIP tent?  Yeah.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, that guy was cool.  And what's Lifestyles Magazine  in Buffalo?  The weekly free paper.  Okay, and there's an article  in the latest issue?  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  Came out today.  I think we'll get that up  on FoundryMusic.com.  Thanks, Derek.  No problem.  Okay.  Bye.  Here's Pete.  Hello, Pete.  Hey, Pete, how are you?  How you doing?  Good. 
[00:16:00]  So is it confusing out there  with the lights  and the equipment?  It's exciting.  I think it's exciting.  Are you going to be dancing  with the girls or anything?  I'm going to try.  I don't know if I can  keep up with them,  but I'll try.  It's like Love American  style out there?  Yeah.  All groovy and hip?  Just like the good old days.  Yeah.  Tonight starring  Stucker Channing.  You used to watch that show?  It's pretty risque  back in the efforts day, 
[00:16:30]  Love American style.  Could we get a visor  for Pete today?  What, he needs a visor?  Yeah, and he's got to  put it on upside down.  Oh, upside down?  Upside down, backwards  is the way they're going to.  And glow sticks.  And he's got to call  everybody dogs.  Who's got a visor?  Yeah.  We have to have a visor  down the hall.  Get Rossi.  We need Rossi's visor today.  And don't ask for anybody, Pete.  You just got to go,  where are my dogs at?  Where are my dogs at?  I think dancing is good.  When the youths of today dance,  I think they stay out of trouble.  I think dancing  is a lot of energy. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah?  What about the rampant  sex and drug use  at these dances  and whatnot?  Well, I don't know.  I mean, that's going to go on  regardless, I think.  I think you're right.  He's got a little  Dunny tape he danced  after he smashed him  with a toilet.  Exactly.  That was dancing.  There's going to be a lot  of touchy-feely  going on today, Pete.  Yeah?  Are you ready for that?  I don't know.  Do you know how to do  a thing with the glow sticks  where you wave them  in front of people's faces  and they kind of look at them  and it's like a dance almost?  Not really.  That's after my time. 
[00:17:30]  Well, get me rolling  and I'll sit in the chair.  Okay, here comes Pete's visor.  All right.  No.  It's got to be upside down.  No, man.  It's got to be upside down  and backwards.  No, kind of to the front.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not like that.  That's perfect.  That's not how they're wearing it, though.  Turn it all away.  There you go.  Is that it?  That's how they're wearing it.  Oh, yeah, Pete.  Look at Pete.  Nice.  There you go.  Like the dead end kids. 
[00:18:00]  Like the dead end.  Now another reference  from the 30s.  Like the dead end kids.  I look like such.  Look at Pete.  It's ecstasy engineer.  I love the references.  They're classic.  Literally.  Classic references.  Of vaudeville.  From vaudeville.  Vaudeville.  Looking good, Pete.  What do you think?  Have you seen any  of the young ladies yet?  No, not yet.  I'm waiting.  Yeah.  You always like  looking at an attractive  young lady?  Sure.  I mean, what do you think?  You're a man.  Sure. 
[00:18:30]  I'm still allowed to look.  Of course.  Jordan brings up  a good point in line 10.  Go ahead, Jordan.  Yeah, Pete sounds like  he's from Footloose  or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, keep the kids  out of trouble.  The dancing.  But they weren't allowed  to dance in Footloose.  Yeah, but he's pretty stupid.  Pete thinks dancing's good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Dancing's good.  Are you into  the Crystal Method?  Into their music?  Not really.  No?  You think you'll get  into it a little bit?  You listen?  I think I could, you know.  You're going to do  some Flaming Dr. Peppers  with us?  I don't think so. 
[00:19:00]  Have you ever drank  on the job  in your 40-some-odd  years of employment?  Maybe like a glass  of champagne or something  to celebrate.  Right, to celebrate  many, many years ago.  Yeah.  To celebrate  the invention  of FM radio.  That was the last time  I drank,  the frequency modulation.  Well, every 10 years,  every decade,  I'll have a drink,  you know,  just to, you know.  Is that it?  Yeah.  You don't drink  when you go out, though?  Well, a glass of wine, maybe.  Yeah, a little glass  of wine with dinner, sure.  What about some Uzo?  Oh, yeah,  well, a little Uzo. 
[00:19:30]  A little Uzo, too?  A little dry.  Right, right.  It's like medicine.  Yeah, medicine.  You go over to Greece  and you drink the Uzo.  Look at him and his visor.  With the visor on.  That is great.  You'll never forget us  after you retire, Pete.  You just wait for what  Ant and I do  for your retirement.  Oh, we are going to have  some party for you.  We will make sure you  start your retirement  in divorce court.  All right, Pete.  All right, thanks.  Make sure the turntables  are all hooked up  for the boys, okay?  Years of great service.  There he goes. 
[00:20:00]  Keep that visor on.  Looks good.  Look at him.  He's shaking his head.  He got the duck bill  out the back.  Very good.  Pete Johnson,  our chief engineer.  All right, the girls  are arriving.  Totally got him.  And they all look  really, really good.  I think we do very well.  You know something?  I got to say,  I was the first one  to look over at you  when you start  putting these rules on  and say,  Opa, you're insane.  This is going to ruin this  because we are not  going to get any girls.  But as the time went on 
[00:20:30]  and we were picking the girls  and we were actually  getting girls  that fit the criteria,  I said,  you know something, Opie?  I apologize.  You were indeed a genius  when it came to this.  Thank you, Anthony.  And now the turnout?  Hot girls.  Pretty good.  No money snatch.  But Stinky's laughing  at something.  What's wrong?  Pete with his visor on.  Oh, isn't that great?  It's closing, isn't it?  It's so funny.  Ecstasy engineer.  It's so uncomfortable.  I'm groovy.  I feel like one of those  hip cats from  the Blackboard Jungle movie.  He needs some big pants.  What do they call him? 
[00:21:00]  Mr. Charlie?  No, that was a carty copy.  This is like  to sir with love.  I'm like one of those  rowdy students  in that new motion picture.  Vic Morrow?  Vic Morrow, yeah.  I feel like one of those  hip cats from West Side Story.  I'm like a jet.  When you're a jet,  you're a jet all the way.  Pete, listen to the music  out there and Pete's  got his visor on backwards. 
[00:21:30]  Look, he's coming back in.  Stinky's dancing.  Walking in the doors,  dancing.  What's up, Pete?  What's the matter, Pete?  Why are you coming back in?  Are we getting a sound  out of the...  Is there a hum?  There's something  coming out of  one of the computers.  No, it's probably  my hard drive exploding.  That's just the sound  they're going for.  Yeah.  Hey, John, what's going on?  Yeah, hey, Opa.  Are you going to be  on more sports for me?  Oh.  Yes, I am.  Hey, you have to look  at moresports.com.  You have to see  what they're selling  on their website.  What are they saying? 
[00:22:00]  Just look at the website  and see what they're selling.  What are they selling?  What are they selling?  Just tell us.  It's the baseball pants.  You have to see  the baseball pants.  All right.  Thank you, John.  Yeah, more sports  tonight at 10 o'clock.  I become...  10 o'clock.  WNBA stalker.  I was getting an email  today before the show.  People are pissed off at me.  They're like,  why are you dressed  like that on the website?  Don't they listen?  They don't understand  I'm in character.  Don't you like  I'm in character?  I don't walk around  the streets like that  every day.  I'm in character  like Mr. Amistad.  That's right.  I'm in character. 
[00:22:30]  Character.  I'm playing a stalker.  You've got to look  like a stalker.  I've got polyester pants.  Someone asked me  about the glasses  I'm wearing for the skit.  Yeah.  They were prescription,  subscription,  prescription,  prescription.  Prescription.  Subscription glasses.  I know.  So I couldn't see  a thing through  the whole thing.  Oh my God.  Jim from Philly  has a great observation  about contestant 128  Madison from Vegas  that we think is a man.  Go to the site, man.  That's a guy  with breast implants.  Jim.  Yo.  You picked this one, man. 
[00:23:00]  He, she is a dead ringer  for who you're saying.  Who does he look like?  Oh, absolutely.  It's just, you know,  stick a blonde wig  on Niedermeyer  from Animal House.  Bravo.  Niedermeyer  from Animal House.  Oh.  That absolutely  is Niedermeyer.  Oh.  And there's a little,  there's a combo there too.  Possibly Dee Snider  from Twisted Sister.  Yeah, which is odd  because Niedermeyer  was in the  Dee Snider  Twisted Sister videos. 
[00:23:30]  That came to mind too.  And also,  Ted Nugent.  A little Ted Nugent.  Yeah.  There's definitely  a male thing  going on there.  Yeah, so in other words,  there is nothing  feminine about this dude.  Not a thing  except those two melons  that were plastered  onto this guy's chest.  Yeah, contestant number 128  needs to call us.  Man.  Immediately.  Man.  Yeah.  Get rid of that.  Defend yourself, dude.  Thank you, Jim.  Thank you.  Yes, Rick.  We are up to 12 ladies. 
[00:24:00]  Oh, bravo.  12 ladies are here.  All ladies are here.  All hot.  Ken and Scott are here  from Crystal Method, Anthony.  Great.  We're ready to party.  Oh, we got the glasses  and the shot glasses  to dump in them  for the Flaming Dr. Peppers.  We got a professional bartender  to make us the Flaming Dr. Peppers  from the Hard Rock.  Ben said that Ken and Scott  from Crystal Method,  they didn't care about  the equipment set up and stuff.  They wanted to make sure  that you and I  were going to be doing  Flaming Dr. Peppers  with the guys  to make sure we have  the Flaming Dr. Peppers. 
[00:24:30]  Which brew  were we going to be using  in the Flaming?  Oh, he was one  of our sponsors.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Okay.  See which ones  they prefer.  I already did.  Oh, you did?  All right.  Very nice.  And Ben,  who do we have to thank  for the light show  and the lasers  and the video screens  and the smoke machine?  I am going to be snotty.  Is this legal?  That's Rick's line.  I know.  Ooh-hoo.  Smoke and mirrors.  There's Dennis,  Alpy,  and John.  They're in phone number 
[00:25:00]  917-766-5369.  They did a great job.  So you go outside.  It's a totally different area  that we're used to.  During breaks,  when we go outside,  maybe play a little foosball  or pinball,  the area looks completely different.  It's set up like a party, man.  Okay.  Lasers, lights, smoke.  We're breaking in.  This is going to be  interesting today.  We're going to do a radio show  and party at the same time.  This is going to be rough for me.  Sometimes we pull it off,  other times we don't.  You have self-control.  And you know something?  These guys are all about peer pressure 
[00:25:30]  when it comes to these  Flaming Dr. Peppers.  You know what I mean?  We remember when we saw them live  and they pour these things out.  They slap them in front of you.  And if you don't do it,  you're a pussy.  That's what it comes down to.  And you feel like it.  You know, you're like,  huh.  So I'm always,  I feel like I got to be in there  and doing the shots with them.  So I don't know.  By the end of the show today,  I might be in some really bad shape.  Oh, we'll have to wait and see.  Okay?  Right.  And when we get back, 
[00:26:00]  there's lots of stuff to talk about.  We got to talk about the Pope in Toronto.  We have some interesting observations  about that.  Oh, yeah.  Also,  Louis Black coming in, Anthony.  Louis knows the days to come in.  And we learned something about hotel keys  that I didn't know,  you didn't know.  And it's frightening.  It is frightening.  It really is.  Big Brother is watching.  We'll have the details next.  We at the Opie and Anthony show  love our listeners.  Here we go again. 
[00:26:30]  Stupid son of a bitch.  Are you listening to us, you idiot?  Hey, Alex, you douchebag.  All about radio.  Don't listen some more.  Go ahead.  Get everything else wrong.  Shut the f*** up, you dick.  Think about the people that died.  You wouldn't be making fun of it, right?  Well, think of the people that died  and wish they were spared  so you would die.  But it's a matter of fact,  you guys want to just make the radio.  Please, God, if you have to make  another plane crash,  please make it crash on Alex's head.  You're our kind of people.  We're rolling.  Recording.  94. 
[00:27:00]  WISB.  What's up, Hammers?  This is Jim Brewer.  You're listening to Opie and Anthony.  I'm 94.  WISB.  Why don't you walk it off, dick?  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  The Crystal Method, their remix of P.O.D.'s Boom!  One of the tracks off their new CD community service.  We got Crystal Method in the studio.  Got to say hi to our old pals,  Ken and Scott, Anthony.  Oh, Jesus.  And they've already begun.  They've already begun.  Grab a mic, bro, so everyone can hear you.  The microphones are going to catch on first.  Quick, before, yeah, just dump those.  All right.  They're doing flaming Dr. Peppers as we speak, Anthony. 
[00:28:00]  Getting in the mood for our little partay.  All right.  Pardon me.  Pardon me.  Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!  The girls are arriving with their little outfits.  They're taking turns outside the bathroom.  And there goes in.  A-ga-ga-ga.  That went down smooth.  Ah!  Jesus.  A lot of the girls in their outfits outside the studio.  The dudes that set up the light and laser and video show out there with the smoke machines, 
[00:28:30]  they're really bummed.  They did a great job staging the whole party.  Yeah.  But they're pissed off because there's too many lights on outside the studio.  Can't we dim it a little bit?  We need to dim all the lights.  We've got to kick John Minnelli out of his office.  I was calling him dad before.  John Minnelli's office is right off of the side of the outside area.  John Minnelli, his whole job is to find a new midday show here in New York City.  You don't need to find one today.  Get out of that office.  We've got to turn your lights off.  He comes in the back.  He's drinking his Diet Coke and he walks in. 
[00:29:00]  I was like, dad, you're ruining the party.  Come on, dad.  Leave.  Leave now.  Send him out to a movie, but we'll be back.  So we're working on getting the lights down.  The girls are almost dressed.  And we've got Ken and Scott here as they celebrate the fact that their new CD community service  has hit the stores.  Come on today.  Those are tasty, man.  You feel a little better?  You know, we've got this in-store thing at Virgin Megastore tonight, and we're going to be  in fine spirits by then. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, yeah.  You guys are going to be just fine.  And what time is that at?  7, 7.30.  Whenever you get there.  Whenever you get there.  They'll wait for you.  Oh, the Virgin Megastore in Union Square?  Tonight at 7.30, it looks like.  Okay.  Man.  And you guys are playing this Friday?  Playing Friday at Central Fly.  In New York City.  Here in New York.  We're here all week.  Yeah.  So, got any leftover alcohol?  We might be here tomorrow.  You're more than welcome to come by tomorrow as well.  That area is soaked over there right now, man. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, Pete's freaking out.  We can't put flaming booze into the equipment.  I've never had to deal with this before.  Why don't we get Pete in here?  He's walking around with a visor.  He's the engineer of this place.  He's been here for over 40 years.  He's retiring in less than a year.  He asked us where our guitars were.  Yeah, I know.  Do you need a guitar?  And he's all decked out.  He's got his visor on backwards.  He's looking for some glow sticks.  Do you gentlemen use an organ? 
[00:30:30]  I'll help plug in your organ.  We can't find Pete.  He's a rip.  He's already working some of the girls in the back room or something.  What do you think the ladies we hand-picked for this party?  You're looking great.  For this party.  Here comes Pete.  Look at him.  Look at Pete.  He's got his visor on backwards.  Look at him.  There we go, Petey.  Hey, Pete, get on that mic real fast.  Pete, you want to do a flaming Dr. Pepper?  Not really. 
[00:31:00]  You don't want to try one?  A little wet over here.  Watch out, Angel.  Did you ever drink any scotch with Scotso when he was here?  No.  No?  Yeah.  Scott didn't do any drinking while it was on, you know.  Oh, stop.  I heard stories of Keith Moon and him being in here just pounding it down.  You just didn't see it.  Pete, the flaming Dr. Pepper's got all over the equipment.  But so far, we're still on the air, though.  They could make it a little sticky.  Those FCC rules are vague anyway.  Yeah.  It's like the board operator can't be drunk, that's all. 
[00:31:30]  Such a gray area.  Just the board operator who's opie.  I used to do college radio.  We've got problems today.  I don't interpret that anyway to, like, fit the situation, you know?  If you're just hanging out, you should be able to do flaming Dr. Pepper.  Hey, Anthony, I think Ken and Scott need to do another one before they start the party.  Oh, yumping yiminy.  This is a little early for these guys, so I think we've got to get them in the mood for the party.  Yeah.  Why don't we get some of the girls in here, too, to see what they're wearing for the Crystal Method party today.  Yeah, I was just looking around.  And outside.  Are we taking pictures and video, hopefully? 
[00:32:00]  I sure hope so.  Okay, good.  Because I think the selection of girls was excellent.  Thank you, Anthony.  We know now how to do this.  I will take all the credit.  And well, you should.  You guys were all getting lazy on me.  It only took us four years to figure out how the hell to pick these girls.  Very nice.  Yumping yiminy.  What was the secret?  The secret is you put such limitations on the girls that call up to get on.  What were the pitfalls before?  Oh, we did something called the money snatch. 
[00:32:30]  And I don't eat.  Girls had to run around the studio naked and grab money off of the ceiling, floor, walls.  And they got to keep the money that they could put in a certain area and then let go with their hands.  And the girls we got were just, they were the most putrid, effed out, fat whores I'd ever seen in my life.  There was a couple of cute ones.  Oh, there was, yeah, one.  One cute one.  Just tag some of that video on like a backyard wrestling video. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, hell yeah.  It was a lot of fun to watch.  I think they were backyard wrestlers.  I think they were doing the tuck with the duct tape and sticking the money somewhere else.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  We got a problem, man, today.  What's the problem?  Super GM Ken Stevens talking to Rick.  That's never good.  Oh, get him out of here.  Wint, wint, wint, wint.  Go back to Washington.  Get Ken in here.  Get Ken in here.  Send Ken back to D.C., please.  We already have a cool Ken associated with the show today.  We don't need the boring Ken. 
[00:33:30]  Here comes Ken.  Ken.  Ken.  Where's Ken?  Guys, don't be scared.  I know he looks like a dad, but he's not.  He's no one's dad around here, anyway.  Dad!  What?  Dad, we're just having a party.  Can't you leave us alone for a while?  What's going on, Ken?  Why are you talking to Rick already?  I just heard a lot of noise out here.  I just wanted to see what was going on.  Everything's fine out there?  You see?  It's nice.  Set up like a real party.  Rick is just giving me a list of things I can worry about.  We saw him pour a little 151 in that.  Oh, things you should worry about. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  And you don't see anything that you're looking at right now, right?  No, because that would be wrong.  That's right.  Right.  That would be wrong.  Very good, Ken.  Very good.  We got you well trained.  Why don't you...  Would you like a visor?  You want to put on a visor like Pete, your engineer of 40-something years, who's already  wasted around here somewhere?  Do you want a visor?  You want to do a flaming Dr. Pepper?  No, thank you.  You're doing really good with your coffee.  Dr. Pepper's good, though. 
[00:34:30]  Can you and Minnelli go catch a movie?  Yeah, really.  Or something?  I hear some good movies are out right now.  Yeah, please.  Send them to the movies.  Go see Men in Black, too.  Ken?  Oh.  Totally got him.  All right.  Here we go.  All right.  Now we got to get Rick for the real story.  Rick!  We might have to call the fire.  What was Ken saying?  What was Ken saying?  What was Ken saying?  Come on.  We don't want to blow this thing.  All right.  He just kind of cruised down because he heard about the girls, and of course his excuse was  to get coffee.  Oh, okay.  So he just wanted to scope out the chicks. 
[00:35:00]  He just wanted to scope out the chicks.  So he was acting like he cared.  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  You know, he came down all official life, but he's good.  That's good.  Okay.  That's what we want.  I'll buy that.  Okay.  Oh, here they go again.  Okay.  We're making them a little bit different right now.  Well, I see you're not using as much 151.  Over the years, we've...  Oh, let me just tell you.  I was watching Ty, right?  Yes.  I was watching Ty.  Ty the bartender.  This has about equal parts Amaretto and 151.  Yeah.  Over the years, we've always added equal parts Amaretto and Kahlua, and then put 151  on top, and Ty here is... 
[00:35:30]  No, Ty, come on.  Ty showed up, and he said the way he makes them is just with Amaretto and 151.  He has an alternate recipe, so we're just being, you know...  I don't know.  You know, one time we played St. Louis, and this kid came up to me.  He had to be like 19 years old.  He came up...  We were going off the bus to go inside or do soundcheck, and he's like,  Oh, bro, man, I did...  Me and my dad did those Flaming Dr. Peppers, but, man, they were really effed up, man.  I don't...  Whoa, we got so wasted.  I'm like, how'd you make them?  I'm like, okay, we got the beer, right?  And we got shot glasses, and we put 151 on the shot glass, lit on fire, and dropped it  in the beer.  I was like, that's like a Molotov cocktail. 
[00:36:00]  That is not how you...  That's a bomb.  That's not how they do it at the Dodger in...  The Dartful Dodger in Huntington.  At least they live to tell you about that story.  Yeah.  Doesn't the Kahlua help, though, with the flavor of the Dr. Peppers?  Well, we're going to find out.  We're testing.  We're all about science here.  I don't like his way.  There's not enough fire involved.  Here we go.  There's not enough fire involved.  All right, here we go.  Well, there could be if that spills, because that's a lot of 151.  Well, that's a nice blue flame.  We should have a fire extinguisher in here.  We really should.  Oh, boy. 
[00:36:30]  All right.  There goes Scott.  All right.  There goes one of our party girls, and there goes Ken.  Too much 151.  You didn't like that one?  Too much, right?  No, it's good.  You like that?  It's good.  I want it with the Kahlua.  We're switching back to the Crystal Method method.  Yeah.  All right, they're going to switch back to the Crystal Method method.  You're insane.  We have one more, though.  Watch that one.  That's still it.  I don't like it with just 151.  Let Rick do it or something.  Someone ready to do another one?  Go ahead, because I like it with the Kahlua.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  Ben.  All right, here we go. 
[00:37:00]  All right, here we go.  Oh, you want it the other way?  Oh, my God.  Scott said, what the hell?  I'll do another one.  Scott said, back to back with a lot of 151.  Woo!  Scott, one half of the Crystal Method.  Can we get a shot of these slippers on the website?  Yeah, you like that?  Yeah, one girl's wearing slippers.  She's wearing, like, cats on her feet.  Kittens.  She's got a great, great little outfit on.  Those are the...  Little leopard print top.  Those are the kittens that the guy was singing about, right?  Yeah.  This will be like the Olympic flame, I think.  We'll just let this burn over here until the glass shatters.  Yeah, and bring in another... 
[00:37:30]  Lights the whole thing on fire.  There's a little girls out there.  Bring in another girl.  Bring another...  And I like the little leopard print top with the spaghetti straps over the top.  Very sheer.  She's wearing a matching thong.  Nice.  And what do you got on?  A little skirt?  A little short.  Yeah.  How did you make it through the cut with your hair?  No, she was the one that...  We had a picture of her.  Right.  From the Naughty Nighty contest.  That's right.  See, y'all?  You were talking about the short hair.  It's cute.  Yeah, yeah.  And then drink it.  All right, there you go.  Just watch how you drop it. 
[00:38:00]  This is...  Make sure she's very careful in how she puts it in the glass.  This is Corinne, right?  Oh, Jesus.  Yes!  Dude, Corinne from the WOW Contest has joined the party.  Oh, you've got to keep going.  I forgot what contestant she is.  What number was she?  She was one of the early contestants.  21.  Contestant number 21 from the WOW Contest is partying with the Crystal Method.  Corinne, what do you think?  Was that a good one?  That was a good one.  That was all right?  And she's got a real nice little outfit on, too, Anthony.  Yeah, there you go.  Solid.  Are we doing body shots today? 
[00:38:30]  We could do body shots.  Ooh, body shots.  Hey, Corinne, could you show Ken and Scott your WOW there?  She's in our WOW Contest.  Yeah, these guys.  These are the...  Yeah.  Would you like to see...  Yeah, here you go.  Look, look, look.  There you go.  He didn't see.  He didn't see.  Look at Ken.  Are you getting shy on us?  Hey, what's wrong with you?  No, no.  All right, show them.  Go!  Yeah, a little WOW.  There you go.  Yeah.  There you go.  Very nice.  All right?  Okay. 
[00:39:00]  Wow.  Hang some towels on those.  Something.  I don't know if she's taking that as a compliment, Scott.  It's a beautiful little...  She's beautiful.  Yeah.  She should.  Are the rest of the ladies getting ready outside?  Are they...  I saw that they're all wearing little things.  Ty's slacking over here.  He's talking to the ladies.  They're all wearing little outfits.  We are running low on Amaretto.  Fill them back up.  Uh-oh.  We're going to have to make another run.  Ty, the bartender, helping us out today from the Hard Rock, by the way.  Why don't we bring in a couple of more and meet everybody? 
[00:39:30]  Hi.  All right.  Ty looks a lot like Tricky's.  All right.  Make sure all the girls get friendly with each other.  I don't want any shy girls around here today.  Here we go.  These two are very friendly with each other.  Yeah.  Why are you guys so friendly with each other?  Hi, girls.  Grab a mic.  Slide that one over that way.  Wow.  You got hotter.  I got hotter.  She's from the Naughty 90 contest.  Yeah.  You wore the red outfit, right?  Black and red, yeah.  And what's your name again?  Melanie.  Melanie.  Look.  Teen Melanie.  Remember? 
[00:40:00]  I thought he just met since the last Flaming Dr. Pepper.  That'll happen, too.  All these girls will be tens by seven o'clock.  That happens.  Why are you guys so friendly with each other?  I mean, we're not complaining.  I'm just wondering.  Why not?  Do you know each other?  Yeah.  You came together?  Yeah, we did.  Do you guys, like, make out and stuff?  Not really.  You just hold each other like that?  Do you want us to not touch each other?  No, we want you to touch each other.  But we just find it weird.  Like, Ann and I are pretty good friends, but you wouldn't see us holding each other like 
[00:40:30]  that.  Not in public.  Unless we were going to go for it.  Huh?  It's not very attractive.  I don't know.  That Halloween party, you guys were getting kind of close.  Oh, right.  That's great.  You're wearing a little wow half shirt.  I love you guys.  You cut it down to the oh and wow, which is very nice.  You got a little...  What are you wearing down below there?  Your entire belly is showing.  Very nice.  You're wearing a little black skirt.  What is that?  Black sweatpants.  Oh, black sweatpants.  It's supposed to be a pajama theme.  Right.  I don't want to go all the way. 
[00:41:00]  Well, some of the girls are going to get completely naked.  I'm just warning you now.  Teen Melanie with the pink top and white, what is that, sweatpants, little things.  But the hot thong sticking out of the top on either side.  Yeah, it's kind of that Britney Spears thong poking out thing.  Britney Spears?  Well, you know how she has the thong thing.  Who is she?  Yeah, that's so old now.  No.  Oh.  Very good.  Very good.  All right, ladies.  Go have fun.  We'll talk to you in a little bit, okay? 
[00:41:30]  Tender.  Look how tender, Hopi.  Look how helpless.  A couple of our teen partiers.  Teen partiers.  Hey, we didn't know about the pajama theme.  Oh, you didn't?  That's okay.  That's okay.  You guys didn't do it either.  You could have worn your feety pajamas with the hatch in the back.  You only told the important participants.  Right.  Well, we wanted to kind of surprise you.  It's like really nice, you know?  Hi, girls.  Hi.  How are you?  You don't look like you're wearing, like, you don't look like you're wearing. 
[00:42:00]  That hurt me.  Oh, I heard you.  Shut up.  What's the matter?  I have one leg, so I didn't wear a nightgown.  Oh, that's Emma.  Oh, you got one leg.  This chick has one leg, Ken.  You want to see it?  Yeah, pull the leg off.  Yeah, pull it off.  This is a great party trick, man.  She's got one leg.  And she's hot.  Yeah.  One leg.  I'm hot and I got one leg.  That is great.  Did you say hi to Ken and Scott from the Crystal Method? 
[00:42:30]  Hi, Ken and Scott.  They got a new CD that drops today, man.  Drops today.  It's called Community Service and they're doing an in-store at Virgin Megastore in Union Square  tonight.  No, wait, wait.  I think there's...  I'm almost 22.  Huh?  I'm almost 22.  Well, we'll get to it later.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Bear with us here.  Just bear with us here.  Yeah, we'll win.  It looks like she has a wooden leg.  Where do you put that?  And we got two other girls in the studio.  What's going on, ladies?  What's going on? 
[00:43:00]  You're psyched to be here?  I forgot my jammies.  You did.  Well, you got...  And I tried to find no one had extra jammies.  Do you have a bra and panties on?  I have a bra on, but no panties.  It's fine.  Oh, darn.  Well, let's see your bra.  Let's see your bra.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, there you go.  Yeah, take the shirt right off.  That's nice.  They're not wows, but they're there.  That's nice.  There you go.  Take the shirt right off.  That'll qualify.  Because it's fine.  It's like you're walking around with a bikini top on.  Yeah, you're fine.  Look at that.  Yeah, see?  Very nice.  Because that's not like a really revealing bra or anything. 
[00:43:30]  It looks like you're at the beach.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go.  Take your bra off and kick it off now.  All right.  Give us some time, Vince.  Relax.  Just getting started here.  And who are you?  And you are?  I'm Alan.  I live with Sarah.  We live together.  Oh, she kind of snuck you in, didn't she?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I knew it wasn't one I picked.  Very good.  And are you guys friendly with each other?  Very much.  Oh.  In what way? 
[00:44:00]  Like?  Oh, thank you.  Oh, no.  Like, are you just roommates or are you...  We sleep together.  You sleep in the same bed.  Isn't that adorable?  You sleep together.  Can we see a little something?  Uh, I think...  No.  I don't think Alex is...  Alex is kind of shy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Alex.  A little shy.  All right.  Maybe a little later, Opie.  You're Alex?  Alex.  Oh, Alex.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I thought you said Alex.  Yeah, me too.  All right.  You look like an Alex. 
[00:44:30]  Isn't Alex?  Do you want her to be Alex?  Yeah, you're Alex for the day.  You're Alex for the rest of the day.  Is that good?  Or how about Bob?  Bob.  No?  Alex.  Alex.  All right.  You'll be Alex.  All right.  Thank you, ladies.  Thank you for showing up.  And, uh...  Very nice.  See, now you got the bikini top on thing going and it's working for you.  You look like Herbie Village is.  Thank you.  And get friendly with each other, okay?  All right.  Um...  And she snuck in.  She snuck in.  It was so obvious.  In. 
[00:45:00]  Oh, God.  How did that happen?  And I bet she's having her time, too.  Just to boot.  Let me ask her.  Which was a very big limitation.  Yeah.  Guys, we made sure none of these girls were having their time.  Because we didn't want any cranky girls.  That was one of the conditions.  Yeah, it was.  Yes.  It was absolutely one of the conditions.  No time of the month.  Because they get all...  If I may use the pun raggy.  I didn't even want them ovulating, but, you know...  No, sir.  Here's the big question.  Because I told Steve to turn down the speakers back there.  Yeah.  You guys have seen that Saturday Night Live skit, right? 
[00:45:30]  That's right.  That's why we said you look like an Alex.  Oh.  The girl with the no...  Is that her name in the skit?  The girl with the one leg on the Illuminate...  On the...  What is it?  There's an MTV skit that the girl does.  I'm hot and I've got one leg.  I didn't see that one.  Yes.  Yes.  I swear I did not see that.  I'm waiting for her leg to catch on fire from the Flaming Dr. Pepper.  It just smells like a nice winter night in front of the fire.  Let me tell you something else. 
[00:46:00]  It almost looks like...  Yeah.  The girl?  The blonde hair, the same character, everything.  Really?  Yeah.  Maybe it's her.  No.  You've got to prop her up with an ottoman on one side when you doggie her.  Or else she tips over like a table with a broken leg on it.  What's that show called?  Dismissed.  It's like she comes out and goes, yeah, I'm hot.  Yeah, I'm young.  I'm hot and I'm blonde.  And I've got one leg.  Maybe it is.  Who knows?  Now that's a party.  There's nothing wrong with one leg.  I want to sell that prosthetic right down the hallway.  Just get a hold of one leg in one side and a stump in the other and just bang away. 
[00:46:30]  Are we doing one more before we take a break here?  This is Kahlua?  Yeah, this is the crystal method.  The crystal method way?  I'll do the crystal method method.  Crystal method method.  There we go.  Torching them up.  TCM squared.  Light them up.  There we go.  And then you guys will spin for a little bit?  Absolutely.  I don't know how we're going to work this out because we want you on the radio as well.  Fire, drinking, electronics, and a lot of paper laying around in close proximity. 
[00:47:00]  Really seems dangerous.  Maybe the newspapers can be moved.  You know, Dan Haggerty once lit his beard on fire doing these.  All right, they're lighting them up.  Here we go.  All right.  I'm up.  I'm up.  Oh, wait.  Hold on.  See this?  Oh, that's okay.  Ken couldn't wait.  It's really not.  Ken couldn't wait.  Here we go.  Anybody else?  We have three more lit.  Ben's over there.  Ben will do the crystal method way.  Scott with one ahead of me.  There goes Anthony.  There goes Scott.  Well, Scott's now one ahead of you again, Ken. 
[00:47:30]  Well, look at the smoke resin.  All right.  And a little bit more beer.  A little bit more beer.  But that's good though.  All right.  Very tasty.  Oh, my God.  Anybody?  Anybody?  Right about now, the 151 is rising up through the chest.  It's almost like Christmas, isn't it?  It's almost like Christmas.  And we've got to credit, Ty, because normally by this point, there would be at least the countertop  on fire or someone's hand.  Definitely on fire.  Well, we were there last time when the table got set on fire.  In Boston, we saw that whole thing go down. 
[00:48:00]  It was great.  But you can't hesitate, though.  You have to continue to drink and then deal with the flame afterwards.  That's right.  A true man finishes the flame.  Oh, you got it.  And then puts his hand out.  It looked like Fox's stunts gone wrong last time we were doing these shots at you guys,  man.  Really bad.  All right.  We're going to step aside and break.  Lewis Black coming in today as well.  Of course he is.  Maybe he'll do some.  All right.  Of course he will.  We'll get him to do one.  We've got to do...  Back in Black.  We've got to discuss the whole Del Key thing.  You guys like Back in Black?  We love it.  On the Daily Show?  And also, I'd like to...  Because he's insane. 
[00:48:30]  I'd also like to request a song.  Can I request a song, too?  I'd like to see if we can get it on air before the end of the day.  Yeah.  They were listening to this earlier.  Can it be Flare?  Hey, we'll get it right on for you.  Yeah, we're going to do that next.  Sure.  We're also going to Cleveland next.  Oh, we are going to Cleveland.  No, no.  Stop.  Someone's busting my balls.  So are we.  I'm getting some feedback saying, you guys will never come to Cleveland.  It's like how you were talking about how you request songs and they never get on  the radio.  When are y'all going to be in Cleveland?  We'll be right there. 
[00:49:00]  We're going to be there in a week and a half.  We're making plans to go to Cleveland.  They gave us a great ratings book and we've got to get out there and say hi to everybody.  Crystal Method will be in Cleveland July 31st at Nautica.  There you go.  Nice.  You guys are efficient.  And we're going to put all the tour info on foundrymusic.com because we're in a lot  of cities.  Cool.  And a lot of people want to see Crystal Method.  The new CD's out, community service.  It's in stores right now, right?  Exactly.  And they're doing the in-store later on today.  Really, really wasted.  At the Virgin Megastore on Union Square.  They're supposed to be there at 730. 
[00:49:30]  We'll see what happens.  Okay.  Hotel keys when we get back.  All right.  We can do a little radio and a little this, a little that.  Let me lick that off.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sex for Sam.  Three.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  On 94 W.  Opie and Anthony.  The party has begun, Anthony.  Oh, my God. 
[00:50:00]  You're listening to Crystal Method in the background.  Our house band today.  We were hanging out on the sidelines just like usual when I used to go to clubs and just looking  at the girls and me and Big Kev are standing in the corner.  I'm like, I think that chick's looking at you.  You're going to make a move just standing on the side like worthless pieces of crap, looking  at hot girls dance, knowing you're never even approaching them.  Boy, I hope you asked me to skate. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what it was like.  Just standing in the corner.  All the guys are just like standing, looking.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Great.  Went to some stud to come and pick the girls up.  Awful conversation.  Oh.  Hey, you in the Naughty Nighty Con.  Yeah.  How's it going?  That was a good contest.  Yeah.  You look really good.  Yeah.  It was cool.  No, because I was there yesterday when they did that.  No, no.  I understand.  You got to go talk to your friend.  That's cool.  I'll be around.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just realized I only have a rap when the girls are ugly. 
[00:51:00]  Is that it?  The fatter they are, the cockier I am.  Exactly.  Well, how cool is this?  Crystal Method.  Yeah.  We got a house band today.  They came in to celebrate with us.  They got a new CD out, community service.  It's in stores now.  They're doing an in-store later today at Virgin Megastore in Union Square here in New York  City, 730 tonight.  But they are spinning live right now outside our studio.  With the lights, video screens. 
[00:51:30]  They went all out, man.  And chicks starting to dance.  And they're little shorts.  And they're little leopard print tops.  Very sheer.  Just bras.  I'm waiting.  I'm sure very shortly the thongs will be all they're wearing.  One girl's walking around with a little stuffed animal.  Big kitty slippers.  It's really funny, too, because Pete, the engineer, we dressed up as ecstasy dad today. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  We should call him ecstasy granddad, but we're helping him out a little bit today.  Ecstasy Pete, you want to roll?  I was rolling hard last night.  Look, I'm sweating.  He won't let us turn on the smoke machine.  Why?  Something about a fire alarm.  I don't know.  Oh, do you think the alarm would pick up the smoke from the smoke machine? 
[00:52:30]  Can we get Pete in here?  That's the final piece to our party.  We got the girls.  We got the crystal method.  Yeah.  We got other things.  We need our smoke machine.  You know, it was great.  He came up to me.  He goes, hey, dog, chill with the smoke.  Chill with the smoke.  We don't want to bring the 5-0 down on us.  He's got his octopus pants on. 
[00:53:00]  My snatch pants and panties.  We can't even find Pete because it's pitch dark outside the studio.  Oh, I'm sure he can't even see.  He's probably tripping over girls.  I can't see.  This is not the environment for an engineer to do work.  Here comes Pete.  Pete, what do you think, man?  It's too dark in there.  I can't see.  I need, like, a light.  I need a light.  Why don't you grab some light sticks?  Do you work with light sticks?  He's got the duct tape, though.  He's making sure everything's taped down. 
[00:53:30]  Taped down.  He is a pro.  That means he's ready to get laid.  That's what I do.  I duct tape their feet and hands.  I'm in here to get two up on Ken.  Let's go.  Here we go.  Oh, Scott's back from Crystal Method.  Oh, you want to go?  Let it rip, man.  Now, you've got to explain the Flaming Dr. Pepper.  I swear to God, we'll get an email from people.  I don't know what a Flaming Dr. Pepper is.  So give them the official Crystal Method recipe.  The Flaming Dr. Pepper is the absolute greatest drink in the world.  The reasons being is that you get more powerful with each drink.  And you get more loving. 
[00:54:00]  It's almost like E with speed.  I don't know.  Some sort of, like, thing.  It's almost, I think of it as more an opium head.  There you go.  Opium head.  I like that.  I like that.  And then what happens is you just keep getting, like, ooh, I just love myself.  I love the world.  You just keep going until about, some people, it ranges between 5 and 12.  But somewhere in between there, you're like, woo, I can't, let me drink another one.  And now, all of a sudden, you're.  That's what happens.  You don't, there's no, there's no anger.  There's no, like, you know, I'm going to kick your ass. 
[00:54:30]  Well, let's see.  Let's give one to Steve C.  Oh, hurry.  We're, uh-oh.  You want to see Steve C.  You watch him get all belligerent in one shot.  Let's not.  He'll want to fight everybody.  Hey, Pete.  You go from loving the world to barreling through a shot.  Pete, you want to do one with us?  Pete, you're retiring soon.  Come on.  I get nasty of when I drink.  No, this is, I swear, this is the good science.  This one will not make me nasty.  Yeah, it won't.  This is the happy buzz, Pete.  This is not like that, like, scotch and soda.  Come on, Pete.  You know what nasty Pete is, though?  Nasty Pete is, hey, I can't see.  It's too dark out there. 
[00:55:00]  Darn it.  That's like nasty Pete.  He's doing a good job out there.  He's taping everything down, making sure the girls don't slip.  Come on, Pete.  Let's roll.  No smoke machine, though.  No, that's too bad.  Why can't we use the smoke machine?  Because we're going to have the fire department.  Oh, yeah.  The fire alarm.  Oh, the fire department will come down?  Yeah.  Well, they'll party.  Those guys need a break.  We're getting video of this whole damn thing?  And snapshots?  Cool.  Come on.  Snapshots?  Where are you?  The Grand Canyon, 1968?  Take a snapshot.  I got my Instamatic. 
[00:55:30]  Come on, Pete.  Do one.  I did nothing wrong.  One flaming Dr. Pepper, Pete.  I'll cut the alcohol in half for you.  Yeah, you are.  Oh, how about that?  You've never bonded with us.  He'll make a small one.  He'll make a small one.  First of all, I don't like beer.  I don't know.  I don't like beer either.  I'm telling you, this is somewhere in between both worlds.  You don't taste the beer.  Right.  You do not taste the alcohol.  All you taste is like Dr. Pepper.  Tastes like Dr. Pepper.  Do you like Dr. Pepper?  I drink Dr. Pepper because I'm proud.  Come on, you do.  I'm part of an original crowd.  No? 
[00:56:00]  All right, I'll make him do it.  Watch.  Faggot.  No?  It's not working on you?  It works on me all the time.  Drink it, faggot.  Oh, damn it.  All right, I got it now.  I'm a pepper.  You're a pepper.  Pizza pepper.  We're a pepper.  No, Pete?  No.  We'll turn off all recording equipment.  Yes, all.  Yes.  And then we'll just say.  We'll turn the lights out.  And we'll just say on the air that you're doing it, but of course we all know you're not.  We'll get him fired without a pension, like months away from his retirement.  I'm destitute because of those a-holes. 
[00:56:30]  I don't get my gold watch now.  I get a swatch.  You get a swatch because of those two a-holes.  They've ruined my 45-year career with one drink.  With one ponte.  Now I'm hooked.  No, nothing?  No, he ain't going to do it.  Good.  Now we do the, now after he says no, no, no, so many times he goes, good, more for us.  All right, did you explain the official recipe?  The crystal method version? 
[00:57:00]  I don't think I never had a chance to.  It's actually equal parts amaretto and Kahlua.  Now make sure when you go to the store you get good amaretto.  Yeah.  Because fake amaretto is bad.  Right.  I don't know, they make it in a basement somewhere in New Jersey or something.  In a crystal meth plant.  But you can skim on the Kahlua.  Somehow they've been able to match that recipe.  But make sure it's good amaretto.  So equal parts amaretto and Kahlua.  And then 151.  There's only 151.  That's Bacardi's 151.  And it kind of looks like, make sure you get the right one. 
[00:57:30]  It's the only one.  Bacardi 151.  You spoon that on top or just place a little bit on top of that.  Just top it so it catches fire.  Make sure you get a good shot glass.  The greatest shot glasses in the world are those little, you know those jelly jars you get in the hotel room?  Oh yeah.  And also, I found this out in Vegas, you hold on to the top and they're portable.  You take them with you.  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, they're the greatest thing because you just make them, get them all ready, screw the top on, put them in your bag. 
[00:58:00]  You're like the alcoholic Martha Stewart.  I love it.  Take it with you.  And then you can take it to your local bar or go down to the store and get beer.  Light beer is better.  Don't get the dark beer.  Make sure it's something that you can't really taste it.  It's like a Bud Light is good.  This just in.  Ken is back in the studio.  Ken and Scott are back in the studio.  He's trying to catch up.  Pete is manning the turntables outside the studio.  Pete is actually, yeah, manning the turntables outside. 
[00:58:30]  So then what you do is you light the shot on fire and then you slowly and make sure you keep safety in mind, drop it into the half a glass of beer.  Half a glass of beer, like pint glass.  Yeah.  Make sure you do it over a tarp or some sort of fire retardant, like, you know, area.  Yeah.  And then you slam it.  You can't sip it.  This is not one of those sip and pussy drinks.  You have to slam it.  You got to drink the whole thing right away.  All the way down.  And it's good to have, like, a group of people with you because then it's like a, woo!  It's like a party, right? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, it's like a party.  I hear this is how Phil from Pantera burnt his parents' house down.  It was, uh...  Is that the guy that owns the strip club in Texas?  Who, Phil from Pantera?  Yeah.  I think...  You know something?  He might.  I don't know.  He is.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  He owns a...  That's a true story.  That guy is insane.  Wow.  Ken has all the facts.  Look at you.  You know little Leslie from Texas?  Oh, yeah.  She used to work for her.  Oh, yeah.  Little Leslie, huh?  From Texas.  From Texas.  Nice.  We'll bring her up here next time we're on the air. 
[00:59:30]  All right.  I guess pour the beers, fire them up, and let's rock and roll.  I think Ty's slipping.  He's out there with the ladies.  Oh, is he?  Yeah, Ty, the bartender.  What happened to him?  Oh, the bartender's talking with the girls.  He's the guy.  He's that guy at the club that you sat and watched make time with the girls.  Anthony?  A lot of people calling us and saying that the smoke will not affect the fire alarms, Pete.  No, it actually will.  No, I think it will.  It will.  They're saying the smoke machine will do nothing to smoke the lights. 
[01:00:00]  Believe me, we've been at many events when the fire alarm is going up.  Here's the thing, though.  It's not the smoke.  It's the battery out of the fire alarm.  It's not a battery.  What do you think?  It's one of those that you buy at Home Depot and stick it up?  This thing is hardwired into the building.  Hit some kind of button that says bypass.  No, we got one of those systems where it sucks the oxygen right out of the room.  Believe me, on the first floor, you'll hear,  Everybody, please evacuate the building until the fire department shows up.  And then not only the fire department, the building people come up and say,  What the hell are you guys doing up here? 
[01:00:30]  Last time it went off, we were cooking rats.  We skinned and marinated and cooked rats, and the smoke got up.  And we had to explain to the building why there were rat pelts and rat meat in frying pans.  The whole building had to evacuate because of rats being cooked.  Yummy.  It was yummy.  It was a rat au poivre, and it was wonderful.  All right, he's lighting up.  He's putting the 151 on top.  This is like the trademark drink for these guys.  How many of these do you say you do a normal night of playing? 
[01:01:00]  Anywhere between two and six.  But my record is I was, Suzanne, part of our management company, was having a party,  and so I decided to tend a bar that night.  And so always when you tend a bar when you make these, you have to,  because some people don't know what they are,  so you have to, like, make them feel better by drinking with them.  Feel at home.  So by the end of the night, I had 27.  27.  But they were with my, you know, jelly jar, so they're a little bit smaller, but still.  That's pretty impressive. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Hey, Corinne's back in the studio.  She wants to do body shots or have people do body shots off her body, right?  Flaming?  Just pour it over.  Okay, I need a lighter.  Anybody have a lighter?  There's Ty.  Ty, there he is.  Here he is.  Oh, hey, Ty.  Look at the smile on his face.  How many phone numbers did you get there, Ty?  Come on, then.  Ty, compliments to Hargark.  Here he goes.  He's got the lighter.  Hold on, Dan.  Listen.  Listen to the turntable.  No one's manning the turntable.  No one's manning the turntable.  I don't know what to do now. 
[01:02:00]  He was supposed to be manning the turntable.  I'm scratching.  Give me another platter.  Give me another hot wax.  Where's the hot wax?  Bring on the hot wax.  I'm spinning some Elvis.  All right.  Well, screw it.  Oh, I've got to get over here, Albie.  All right.  Get over there, Anthony.  Don't set anyone on fire, girls.  More flaming Dr. Peppers.  Drop it straight in. 
[01:02:30]  And there they go.  A guh, guh, guh.  Slam it.  There you go.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  All right.  Devin Rattray.  Buzz from Home Alone has just walked in.  Fantastic.  Notice everybody that hasn't been on this show in quite some time is showing up.  Devin smelled the alcohol.  I know.  I know.  He smelled it from all the way uptown and said, what the hell?  I've got to stop by.  Yeah.  You know what's great?  Jamaican Mike is showing up to supervise the limbo, and he's using his giant schlong 
[01:03:00]  as the limbo pole, his giant Jamaican schween.  Now, let's get an outsider point of view here.  Devin, you've been to the studio many, many times.  Yes.  It's pretty impressive to walk down the hall, right?  I couldn't believe it when I walked in.  I first walked in, and I really thought that I was somewhere else.  I wasn't sure what was happening.  It's hard to believe it's 420, because it's...  Whoa, 420.  Hey!  Hey!  Wait, it's 420?  It's 420?  I'll be right back. 
[01:03:30]  Hold on.  Club Stinky's got competition now.  Look at it.  Club Stinky's getting very angry that Club O&A has opened up just across the hall.  Right.  Competition.  All the cool people are coming here now.  It's hard to believe the sun is still out, because it is pitch dark in here.  It's so easy to get into Club Stinky now.  There's no lines anymore.  It sucks.  None of the cool people hang out there anymore.  Everyone's at Club O&A.  Club Stinky isn't the spot anymore. 
[01:04:00]  So, Devin, give us the scene that you saw as you walked down the hall.  It reminds me of one of the old, like, my club days, you know, when I used to go in.  I mean, I walked in, and the lights are blinking, and I'm flashing around.  I seriously see girls that I've never seen before, like, just standing around, kind of, like, bopping.  And, like, they're sort of, like, half trance, half sort of, like, the E.  Macaulay's getting all the chicks.  Yeah.  The E's just kicking in, sort of, dance phase.  You know, and I was like, wow, this is crazy.  I mean, this really did remind me of the days of, like, you know, Slime Light or places like that.  And I was like, wow, this is great.  Yeah.  Can I get right into the studio where nothing cool is going on? 
[01:04:30]  You just have to wait outside for a couple hours, you know?  You just have to do one of those.  I might have to.  Flaming Dr. Pepper.  I might have to, indeed.  Wait, hold on a second.  I want to hear something.  You're doing something nice out there.  The Crystal Method.  Yeah.  They're playing Pete's music.  Pete's into the ACDC.  You know, consciousness for us at our in-store is so in doubt right now.  That's the new band, Eck Beck. 
[01:05:00]  They're up to the sixth flaming Dr. Peppers, Anthony.  I know ACDC.  AC is alternating current.  DC is direct current.  I'm an engineer.  Yeah, they started to pull Pete's 45s out of the engineering department.  45s?  You've got 78s.  What are you talking about?  I used to play this on my clothes and play.  Where's the crank on the phonograph?  The lights remind me of when I played with my light bright. 
[01:05:30]  I'd make great colors and shapes.  I used to clean my weed off this album cover.  Yeah.  Shut up, Kevin.  That's up to 20 minutes.  Yeah, they're rocking out there, man.  Ken back in the studio.  Ken?  Uh-oh.  Yeah?  Yeah, the in-store is in question, isn't it?  Those guys are going to be sitting there. 
[01:06:00]  Fans are going to be coming up and talking.  They'll just be like, ah-ha.  What?  You did those hardcore 151.  Serious cappuccinos right before the in-store.  We're good.  Oh, is that it?  You just juice up on some caffeine?  We're going to keep rocking.  I hear you.  What about the body shots?  Who wants to do one of those?  Who's got tequila?  Who's got the body?  Tequila?  We've got the body.  We probably have some in the back.  What can we do body shots with?  We've got some tequila.  Jimmy does them after they're filtered through people. 
[01:06:30]  Corinne just left the studio to get her body ready for the body shots.  Nice.  So, have you noticed we've tried to get to something every break?  Well, we want to talk about the Pope.  I know.  The Pope knocked the kid out today by accident.  The Pope's outside dancing.  No, no.  What happened?  I was watching that.  It was like, it was such a disappointment for all, like, the news.  It's the saddest.  There was, like, you know, negative 200,000 people there or something compared to his past.  Well, the Catholic Church isn't really, like, popular these days. 
[01:07:00]  And it was a youth convention.  But I figured, hey, Toronto.  Yeah, the Pope's not drawing these days.  Yeah.  The Pope's old school.  He's not really drawing.  He's got to go to the smaller venues where the Pope used to pack stadiums.  He's got to do smaller clubs now.  He's doing the club tour.  You know, I've got to say, God bless him and all.  Well, yes, he's the Pope.  He's not functioning.  God bless him.  He doesn't speak.  He can't walk.  He doesn't make half his gigs.  He's like, oh. 
[01:07:30]  Wait a minute.  Cans, sweater meat, breasts, any other terminology than the double T word.  See, the guys are taking turns going outside and making sure the turntables are manned properly.  Right.  And they're coming back in.  Scott comes walking and goes, what?  Why are you guys talking about the Pope?  Last time I was in the studio, you were talking about boobs.  And by the way, we're failing on that whole keeping the records going.  Yeah.  You guys remind me of those America West pilots.  What do we got going on right now?  Pull up.  What do we got going on right now? 
[01:08:00]  You should know.  It's ACDC.  Somebody requested it.  I thought it was Jim Brewer.  I thought it was Jim Brewer.  I thought it was going to play it for him.  All right.  Cool.  We have Cabo Wabo?  Is that what that is?  All right.  Where's Corinne?  It's going to be some vomiting today.  Please.  Wait, wait, wait.  What's the matter?  Ken just wandered outside the studio.  Oh, I thought, yeah.  Every time you say Ken, I think Ken Stevens.  I know.  Like, ugh.  Will Pete do a body shot off Corinne? 
[01:08:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's happening.  No.  Pete is not.  Pete wants to be so far away from this.  He's going to get in huge trouble.  He's almost near retirement.  Another flaming Dr. Pepper happening here.  Who's going to...  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  Here goes Scott.  This is number seven, I think.  Not that we're keeping track, but...  And there's more beer in these later ones.  Rock.  Woo! 
[01:09:00]  That was good.  Rick, are we ready for body shots?  How do they function?  All right.  Clear the table.  Clear the table.  Some men are going to do some...  Some drinking.  There you go.  Nice Matthew Broderick through Ireland ride coming for somebody later.  All right.  We're clearing the table because Corinne is going to donate the body for the body shots.  Here we go.  Corinne, contestant number 21 in the WOW contest, by the way.  Now, for body shots, I noticed clothing kind of soaks up the booze. 
[01:09:30]  You've been even wet before.  Is that a bad thing?  No.  We saw her wet.  Yeah.  She was one of the only girls that hosed down for her pictures.  Yes.  It was a nice effect.  Rick is clearing off the console to get the girls up there.  And we'll do some body shots.  Norton, if you touch yourself in front of me again, I'm going to kick you.  The guy is constantly grabbing his junk when we got girls in here. 
[01:10:00]  I like to ignore it at this point.  Please.  I tried to anyway.  All right.  She's getting out.  Yeah, you just got...  Yeah, that's it.  There you go.  Just get rid of that.  She has matching purple bra and panties.  What a set of cans, huh?  Are we getting shots of this?  We need a shot of that.  We'll have a lot of pictures up on foundrymusic.com of our little party with the Crystal Method.  Their new CD community service. 
[01:10:30]  Hit stores today.  They're doing an in-store at Virgin Megastore.  Downtown Union Square tonight at 730.  Playing in the city Friday at Centro Flies.  Yeah.  Corinne is in position for body shots.  All right.  And we picked the perfect body for body shots.  Here we go.  We got some of Sammy Hagar's tequila making its way onto Corinne's botte.  There it is.  Ken, what's the problem? 
[01:11:00]  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  What's wrong, Ken?  What's the matter, Ken?  Grab a mic, Ken.  What's wrong?  Like a whole jewelry store in her belly button.  Yeah.  It's got a lint in it.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  Pouring in that little pocket and the belly button.  And here we go.  Wow, you're good.  You got the slow pour.  I need some place to lick salt from.  All right.  Well, I think you could figure that out.  Has she been sweating?  All right.  Here goes Kenny.  She could be anywhere.  He's doing a body shot off Corinne. 
[01:11:30]  It's all right.  Don't mind.  Don't.  Yeah.  He's a rock star, for God's sake.  She's getting all nervous.  Get a hold of yourself.  Would you relax?  My girlfriend had never seen this on the internet.  No.  There is no internet.  It's a myth.  Oh, my goodness.  He's licking salt.  Hey, I've never seen a shotgun that way before.  Wow.  Boy, you're a forward kind of guy.  I like that.  Look at him.  Hey, there's no salt there.  There. 
[01:12:00]  You tricked me.  Oh, my God.  A little chaser for you.  And there you go.  There you have it.  Nice.  Ladies, anyone?  Anyone else for a body shot?  Ken did his.  Where's Pete?  Pete's got to do one body shot.  Get Pete in here.  I'll do a body shot.  Crystal.  You want it?  Our new thing.  Yeah.  Bravo.  I think Corinne's in shock.  Are you in shock?  No, I'm not. 
[01:12:30]  No?  You're all right?  I'm all right.  All right.  We got it.  Who's laying down again?  I had a lot of fun.  I thought she was going to.  I thought Crystal was going to do one off Corinne.  I win.  I win.  Oh, yeah.  There we go.  Ken, another shot for you.  Another girl has made her way to the table.  She's made the salt and lime a little more accessible.  Yeah.  She's taken the top off.  That's good.  She saw what happened with Corinne and said, what the hell? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  Why wrap up the salt and the lemon?  You like that, Jimmy?  Oh, boy.  Here goes Ken.  There's some salt.  Doing another body shot.  There's the tequila.  And you got to finish it off with a little lime, my brother.  The lime is the other one.  The lime is the other one.  The lime is the other one.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah.  Nice.  We have a party going on right here.  Oh, my God.  Very nice. 
[01:13:30]  Crystal Method, our house band today.  We try to show you guys a good time anytime you're around.  So, back to the Pope.  The Pope was doing body shots when I saw him on Fox News today.  He was bent all the way over.  And who said that he looks like he should be in front of a piano?  Yeah, he was in front of the podium and he was hunched over at the mic.  And I was waiting for him to break into Piano Man by Billy Joel.  He looked like he was hunched over.  He also looked like Bela Lugosi in Ed Wood. 
[01:14:00]  Eddie.  Ed, let's shoot this effort.  He looks like a creature now.  They can't even put the big giant Pope hat on him because his head,  he can't even support the weight of the little Catholic yarmulke they put on him  with the little beanie on top.  He can't even support that weight.  He's hunched over.  And then, to get to the point where you can't walk,  remember when he was the young Pope, relatively speaking,  back in the 70s when he was elected Pope or appointed whatever they do? 
[01:14:30]  When he was 90?  You know something?  But he was kind of robust.  He was like the Pope for the new, the modern day Pope.  And he would walk around, he'd talk to people.  He was a little more accepting of modern ways.  And now you look at him, not only does he have the Popemobile that he drives in,  if they have to transport him from the podium to anywhere,  they put him in this hopefully shopping cart.  It's like this gold bin that they throw him in and roll him down this red carpet. 
[01:15:00]  And I've got to think, it's pretty degrading for the old guy.  And he doesn't want to do this anymore.  I could just see him like that guy in Caddyshack.  There is no God.  I'm a man.  But he does want to.  It's like he's kind of saying, listen,  I'm the only one that could possibly be enthusiastic about this.  Just let some young guy take over.  I mean, he can't walk.  They can't until they die.  And Opie brought up a great point. 
[01:15:30]  How many Popes do you think the church killed?  Because, you know, it's a PR thing.  You've got to realize it's showbiz.  It's showbiz.  There's a lot of marketing that needs to be done.  And they're not getting much done.  The Pope is not marketing.  There's that one crazy story about a female Pope.  Are we talking about the Pope again?  We are fixated on the Pope.  God, I've left the room.  14th century.  Yeah.  What is up with the Pope?  Do you know how unsexy the Pope is?  That's just it.  I think the Catholic Church needs a new promotional tool.  I saw the guy earlier. 
[01:16:00]  He looked like he was about to die.  Yeah.  It's really sad.  And I think they keep pushing him out there.  Go on.  You can go to Argentina.  You can go to Canada.  He at any point can say, let's bring in a new guy.  Is it true that the Pope's...  No, not when you're the Pope.  Is it true the Pope's wife, Sharon, keeps propping him up on stage to do gigs?  Oh, God.  I get confused every time.  I'm sorry.  It is confusing.  I'm so sorry.  I get confused with the two.  Wow.  They're out on stage.  They're doing things.  Sorry, Jimmy.  Sorry, man.  I guess I won't be getting those OzFest tickets now. 
[01:16:30]  I haven't been there.  All right.  Enough with the Pope.  Yeah, enough with the Pope.  The Pope is wrong.  But he did punch someone today by accident.  This was the sickest thing.  I love that.  They were wheeling up the cripples to the Pope because that's what they do.  And they talk to the Pope.  And some of the cripples are like, geez, this guy's got it.  Yeah, it is.  Boy, this guy's life.  How is this guy going to help me?  This one guy is completely paralyzed.  He's in the wheelchair.  His head is rolling around.  They wheel him up to the Pope.  He starts crying hysterically.  And the newscaster's like, wow, he must feel the energy of being around the Pope. 
[01:17:00]  No, he's looking at the Pope going, if God does this to the Pope, I am going to die in this chair.  I'm dying in this chair.  Then they brought over a young boy.  I guess he had MS or something.  He really didn't have control of himself.  He walked over, tried to bend down toward the Pope to kiss his ring.  And the Pope had one of his Parkinson's spasms punched him right in the forehead.  I'm on the floor in the office dying. 
[01:17:30]  I'm rolling.  The Pope punched the cripple kid.  The Pope punched the cripple kid.  It was great TV if you got a chance to see it on Fox today.  Oh, wow, look at the time.  We haven't broken 50 minutes.  Holy jeez.  We got to take a break.  We're hanging with Ken and Scott from Crystal Method.  I'm sweating.  Is it hot in here?  They're our house band today.  They are spinning live.  We got girls outside the studio.  We got a laser light show, video screens.  And we got an awesome cam that crashes every third picture.  But I'm working on it, people.  But we are taking pictures like crazy. 
[01:18:00]  They'll be up on foundingmusic.com later today, okay?  Roy and video clips.  The Cardinal from Philly writes, do some body shots off the one-legged girl's stump.  Yes!  Oh, body shots off the stump.  Someone ask Emma if we can do body shots off her stump.  She's a good sport.  That would rock.  We're going to step aside for a few minutes.  Bring in half a Mabel King and see if she'll let it happen.  Before break, let's listen to Crystal Method for a second or two. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah!  Yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Y.S.E.  This is Obie and Anthony.  94 W.I.S.P. 
[01:19:30]  And we're back to the party. 
[01:20:00]  The O&A party.  The house band today.  Crystal Method.  Hello.  Crystal Method spinning outside for us.  For us and a lot of hot girls.  Nice.  Body shots galore all over the ball field today.  It's hard to believe it's 450, Anthony.  I know.  It's pitch dark outside the studio.  It's pretty dark in here.  Dude.  Stinky is enjoying the hell out of himself.  I walk outside.  You know, I want to get the vibe of the room. 
[01:20:30]  And he walks up to me dancing.  He's got his hands and little fists.  And he's shaking them in front of himself.  And he walks up to me.  He goes, how are you guys doing?  Because it's loud out there, you know?  Yeah.  How are you guys doing?  Like, great, great.  He goes, what?  I'm going to go mingle over here.  And he danced off.  He danced away.  He danced away.  I was schmoozing.  You were schmoozing.  Yeah, I'm going to go schmooze over here for a while.  I guess we gave up on the phones a while ago, huh?  You can't hear a thing out there.  The callers gave up on the phone. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, the callers gave up on us already?  Well, we got one call saying, should I take my E now?  But you know the one downer?  There is a downer.  The lit up room, the office.  Now, Ken, Jeremy, and Minnelli are in the office, like, looking out.  It's like, what, chaperones?  They're supervising.  Want to make sure we don't put any kangaroo in the punch.  It's like they're chaperoning.  It's annoying.  It's pretty pathetic. 
[01:21:30]  Real fast, I've got to thank Guitar Center, the Musician's Choice, on Route 4 in Paramus, New Jersey.  They helped us out today?  They did.  Oh, they gave us everything today, huh?  Nice.  Crystal Method doing an in-store later on today at Virgin Megastore in Union Square at 7.30.  They're going to be snotted when they get there.  Of course, we're all celebrating their new CD, Community Service.  Yeah.  It's in record stores today.  Yes, Jim?  I would just like those three to not be standing here.  Huh?  Ken and Jeremy.  Yeah, can we kick them out of here? 
[01:22:00]  Of course we can.  Magic Johnson, EZE, and Arthur Ashe would not be as big a sex drive killer as those three.  Looking.  Can you get Rick's going out to look?  Just please kick them out of here.  Are they gone?  Who is black?  Yeah, Ken and Jeremy are gone, but Minnelli's still in there trying to do some work.  Minnelli needs to find a midday show.  Tell him it's like the pressure's on.  Eight minutes to five.  He could take off a little early.  Use my computer.  He's always at the computer.  Tell him to just disregard the pornography and go right to whatever email program he's using. 
[01:22:30]  Look, look, look.  Are you taping on Thursday?  No.  No.  I'm taping on Wednesday.  Let me tell you a funny story.  I can't wait.  He's a big fan of yours.  I know he is.  All of a sudden.  Are you into the Crystal Matthews?  All of a sudden.  All of a sudden.  I didn't know if you were bragging on.  I'm not bragging.  Oh, okay.  So anyway.  I apologize.  Steve Carell plays on my hockey team in L.A.  Is that right?  That's absolutely right. 
[01:23:00]  Steve Carell plays hockey?  He plays hockey?  Yeah.  Steve Carell plays hockey.  He's pretty good.  He's a decent goalie and a decent defense player.  But you don't play ice.  Ice hockey, yes.  Absolutely.  Where's the ice?  There's ice rings all over L.A.  Ice rings.  You ever hear of them?  Wayne Gretzky.  I haven't heard of ice rings, but not in Bucktown.  Wayne Gretzky created ice hockey in L.A.  Yeah, and then they had a center, and that's where they do it.  No, there's like ten places.  But listen.  They don't have central heat in half the building.  When Steve is out there filming that show, whatever it's called. 
[01:23:30]  It's gone.  With the chick.  No, no.  It's gone.  No, mid-season replacement.  No, it's gone.  No, it's back.  No, it's gone.  It's not gone.  It's gone.  Lewis, I think, would know.  I think it's gone.  I don't know.  I heard it wasn't gone either, Lewis.  It's not gone.  It's not gone.  It's supposed to be gone.  No, it's back as a mid-season replacement in whatever.  Middle of the fall.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we got Ken and Scott here from Crystal Method.  Lewis Black has joined the party.  Hey, Lewis.  Lewis, from the Daily Show on Comedy Central.  Back in black. 
[01:24:00]  You made your way through Club O&A to get to the studio?  I did.  What do you think?  What I really like is talking while music is playing in my head.  Why?  What's wrong?  What's wrong?  We're trying to get a vibe today.  Yeah.  There's a vibe, and then there's talking while there's...  It's hard enough for me to get words out with my own noise in my head.  Now I've got that noise.  Plus...  Well, maybe you need a Flaming Dr. Pepper.  Oh, yeah.  Flaming Dr. Pepper.  Have you done those?  Yeah.  And a...  You know...  Hold on.  You got three choices. 
[01:24:30]  You could have a Flaming Dr. Pepper, the Crystal Method recipe.  You could have a body shot off Corrine.  Oh, a body shot of tequila.  Very nice.  Off one of the hot girls.  Third option, body shot off a stump.  Oh, yeah.  There's a one-legged girl out there, Lewis.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  And she'll pull her prosthesis off, and we can do shots.  And she's allowing us to do shots off her stump.  Off her stump.  Stump shots.  Lewis, stump shots.  Stump shots.  Stump shots.  Stump shots. 
[01:25:00]  Stump shots.  You seem like the kind of guy that would cave in to peer pressure.  Not to a stump shot, no.  Look, look.  Look how hot the one-legged girl is.  You've got one leg.  That's nice to see you.  Where's that other hot leg now?  I'm not doing a stump shot.  I'm not doing...  What is wrong with you?  It's called...  What happened to the old Lewis?  The old Lewis?  It was never...  Even the old Lewis never did us.  Yeah.  What happened to the Lewis that used to get arrested for our radio show? 
[01:25:30]  Well, you know, those days you're dead and gone, okay?  I'm shy.  I'm shy.  Did you do a stump shot?  Are you saying there's something wrong with her stump, Lewis?  There's nothing wrong with her stump.  You're going to insult her stump.  You know what I mean?  No.  Can we do a stump shot?  Stump shot.  Stump shot.  Stump shot.  Come on.  Stump shot.  Yeah.  It's really hot outside.  It wouldn't be an O&A party without a stump shot.  You know what I mean?  Does it smell?  But it's tequila, so it's like salty from your sweat.  I'm going to stump off on my stump. 
[01:26:00]  Go wash off.  We're doing stump shots.  Go wash off.  I'm going to do like an O&A.  Wash off.  Wash off.  We can do it like on your stump.  Yeah.  We're doing it on the stump.  It doesn't have to be from the marrow, you know, section of the...  We don't want to suck out any marrow.  Marrow.  Your brother might need it.  Oh, I don't know.  That'll be good.  My God.  Oh, there's a line been crossed.  They didn't even notice.  No one noticed.  Because in the background, it's... 
[01:26:30]  That's good.  You're just gnawing a little tibia.  This is good.  I like the music.  It's crystal method.  It's very good.  Scott's out there spinning.  Ken's in the studio.  Emma's here, and she's ready to allow us to do stump shots.  You're not doing a stump shot.  Stump shots.  Isn't it great that the crystal method can play when one of them is just hanging out drinking?  I kind of like this.  It's like they have a pilot-co-pilot thing.  It's the beauty of all things.  I think we're going to follow their lead, Anthony.  I think so.  We can have one of us electronically just do the show, and the other one can sit home and drink. 
[01:27:00]  She took her leg off.  There it is.  There you go.  It's terrific.  Do a stump shot.  No.  No.  Stump shot.  No.  Not after you said it's all sweaty and all that stuff.  That's hot, right?  No.  What are you talking about hot?  What planet are you guys on today?  Hot stumps.  Nice.  It's down me completely.  That's great.  Get a baby wipe, and let's get the area ready for stump shots.  There's a hole in there, and then I wear a sock.  Let's see the stump. 
[01:27:30]  How bad is the stump?  I don't want to take the sock off.  Well, prop the sock stump up on the console.  Wow.  Look, you've got a pin in there.  Hello.  Hello.  Wow.  Look at that.  I mean, I had major reconstructive surgery on that part of my leg.  That was the car accident or something?  It was a car accident.  Where is that other hot leg now?  Do you go visit it?  I do not want to know.  Really?  It's in some biohazardous waist.  Is it?  You should have mummified it and clipped the toenails every so often. 
[01:28:00]  I actually asked them when I woke up in the hospital where it was, but they didn't find  it anywhere.  No?  Imagine you go visit your leg.  Visit your leg.  Do you know where it is, though?  I think it's been...  Because eventually, I think...  It was like five years ago, six years ago.  I'm sure it's been...  I'd want to keep it so I could, like, when everything comes to an end, you could be buried  with all of yourself.  You know, a lot of amputees actually do ask to keep...  If they know that they're going to have an amputation program, they ask to keep their  limbs so that they can cremate it and give it, like, a morning period. 
[01:28:30]  Really?  I think it's disturbing.  Yeah, that's a little disturbing.  Yeah.  Like, this isn't disturbing.  Oh, yeah, really.  That's true.  I mean, I guess I'm just as disturbing with my...  Stump shots.  Well, if you don't want to do stump shots, that little peg, can you use it as a swizzle  stick for the drinks?  Yeah, yo.  Just stir them up with that little nub.  Lewis is horrified.  Did you have your eye on Paul McCartney?  Oh, my God.  That is, like, the most I'm in.  It's so perfect.  I love it.  Did she, like, bring you guys into the light now?  Heather Mills is my hero. 
[01:29:00]  I want to ask her where she buys her shoes.  Where she buys her shoe.  Where do you get your shoe?  If you guys stood side by side, would you look like the letter M?  No, Ian, you're horrible.  What did you say after I called last week?  Oh, we got six girls in here.  How many legs is that?  Eleven legs?  Usually that follows.  All right.  So are we going to be able to do stump shots, no?  I want to do stump shots.  Ken, we got crystal meth in here today.  He's like, no, it's really hot outside, and I don't want people having it. 
[01:29:30]  Ken, you're drawing the line now?  Can you roll the sock down a little?  I'm all shot up.  Can you wash the stump?  He's a little not so right.  I could roll it down a little bit.  Lewis will do it.  He said he'll do it.  I am not.  He is not doing it.  Hello?  He is not doing it.  She and I reached an agreement.  No, he said he was doing it.  I never said I was doing it.  Would you like a body shot off, Corinne?  You know, how about a body shot?  I can't drink on the air. 
[01:30:00]  Right in the belly button.  Just to be silly.  No.  Belly button.  I don't drink when I'm working.  Belly button.  You're not working.  I'm working.  You're on this show.  This doesn't work.  This stretches the boundaries of my imagination.  You want to talk to guys that really work?  This isn't work.  This is work.  Yeah.  This is fun.  I've got to be aware of it.  The crystal method's working right now, and they're able to drink.  I don't drink.  I'm afraid to drink when I'm on the air.  Really?  Think about it when I have that coffee, how nuts I get.  Do you get belligerent or something?  You know I get belligerent. 
[01:30:30]  You know that.  You've been with me after a show, and I've had a couple of pups, and it's like, he sucks.  Hey, it's mine.  And to hell with that.  Lewis has been coming on this show for four years.  He still doesn't totally get us.  I know.  I'm amazed by this.  What do you even don't get?  You know when to come in, like today, when there's hot girls walking around, and you  know a lot about this show, but you really don't get that you can just pop one open and  do a scum shot.  Yeah, but I also know that one day I came in, and I got on a bus with Schmucky the clown 
[01:31:00]  over here, and the next thing I know, I'm in prison.  Yeah.  So the idea of doing a shot, and then probably waking up two days from now in a Mexican bar  somewhere.  It's one shot, Lewis.  It's not going to be, I know myself.  You know me.  One shot, one shot leads to two shots, five shots.  Side order of fries.  No one's caving in.  Oh, is that a bus?  Great, I'll get on that.  We're going where?  Where are we going?  To chaos?  I'll be there.  No one's caving into the peer pressure. 
[01:31:30]  I know.  I know.  Well, it's early, so calm down.  It's early.  We've got to do stump shots before the end of the party.  We've got to be at work in three hours, so we, you know.  Where do you work?  Cleveland?  You want to prepare the leg?  Don't worry about it.  She's got to prepare the leg for one stump shot.  Devin?  Are you up for a stump shot?  Yes, he is.  Yeah.  Buzz from home alone.  Buzz from home alone.  Suck it on your stump.  Come on.  Yes.  I will do a stump shot.  All right, let's prepare the stump.  Thank God.  Prepare the stump.  Thank God. 
[01:32:00]  I'm thrilled.  You're a fuddy-duddy, Lewis.  Don't wash the stump.  Hello.  You know, Lewis could help us out with the radio show.  We're actually trying to do a radio show as well, as all this chaos.  Yeah, we're trying to just throw in a few things.  We've already talked about the Pope.  We're getting ready to talk about the drunk pilots again.  Very good.  Three gallons of beer they drank between the two of them.  That's not that much.  Well, oh, for you today?  No, but that's not really that much.  Listen, listen.  Oh, that's not that much.  I drink all the time.  Just not now.  Well, not in five in the afternoon when I'm on the air. 
[01:32:30]  Look outside.  It looks like it's 2 a.m.  If you look outside the studio.  Yeah, see?  What are you going on?  Oh, it's so late out there.  Look.  You guys, you know, it's like Lunatic Central.  It's like it used to be.  It was like it used to be good cop, bad cop.  Now it's just you both are beyond belief.  It's two bad cops today.  It's just two bad cops.  And is she going to prepare her stump?  Yeah, she's preparing the stump.  She's washing the sweat off her stump right now.  She's washing the sweat off her stump.  And then Devin will be doing his stump time.  But that helps the tequila go down well.  Yeah.  A little salt on the tequila. 
[01:33:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  Lewis, anything in the news that strikes you funny?  Not anymore.  Not anymore.  I think we've redefined news today.  Do you want to turn down the music a little bit for you?  No, there's nothing in the news that strikes me as funny.  You know what strikes me as funny is that the, uh, this, uh, do you like the, you know,  Mr. Schmucky, the last time we're here discussing, you're the one who says, you know, it's okay  for an American.  I can't wait for your response to this.  Okay, Lewis.  It's okay for an American, you know, to make as much money as he wants. 
[01:33:30]  We've always disagreed on that.  Right.  I think it's a part of what America is all about.  Part of capitalism.  Yeah.  So free enterprise.  So, so where does WorldCom stand with you on this?  Where do you stand on the WorldCom thing?  Well, you know something, Jay?  These are just, these are just a couple of guys jacking the figures around.  You expect me now to defend them?  No.  These are, these are a room full of ass wipes that, uh, we're bilking a lot of people  out of a lot of money.  And nothing's going to change.  And, uh, but, but you know something?  My internet still works.  Everyone's doing it. 
[01:34:00]  Yep.  Everyone's doing it.  Of course everyone's doing it.  To different levels.  But there's a difference between, like, somebody, look, if these internet, you know,  idiots wanted two or three million bucks.  Five million.  Okay?  Five million.  Billions.  Billions of dollars.  There's not enough money to satisfy these pigs.  They're like crack addicts.  Yeah.  Crack addicts actually are better.  Because at least they're killing themselves.  You know?  These guys, by what point do you say you can't buy anything anymore?  How much crap does a human being need?  The head of Oracle last year made $400 million. 
[01:34:30]  But that, is he what?  Is he buying slaves?  It's $400 million.  It's a year.  That's it.  Well, you're done.  You're done.  You don't get any more money.  That's it, you idiot.  You've got the economy of a third world country.  And these jackasses go on TV and go, let's say, is it over?  You think that's over?  You think that's excessive?  And they, no.  They go, no.  Of course it's excessive.  And a moron knows it's excessive. 
[01:35:00]  That's why I'm not drinking.  You know what pisses off?  You know what pisses off a guy that has $400 million?  A guy that has $500 million.  Yeah.  So they want to get, the more money you have, you know this, you learn it from Scarface.  Then you get the power.  Yeah.  But it's all about power.  But it's like the same thing.  It's the FBI and the CIA, you know, not talking to each other because it's a swinging, you know,  swinging penis contest.  You know what I mean?  I don't know which words you can say anymore.  I will not defend those guys because, yes, they were crooks. 
[01:35:30]  But the reason the market's going down now is because now they're saying everybody's doing this.  Every company's doing this.  But it's negative hype that's pushing it down.  It'll come back up.  Oh, of course it'll come back up.  But to send these guys to jail for 10 years and say that's sufficient is not.  You think they should do more than 10 years jail time?  20.  The same guy that picked up arms against the U.S. got 20 years.  Yeah.  And you're putting them in the same category.  I'm saying somebody who screws with like 150, 200, 300,000 lives and screws with it. 
[01:36:00]  Idiot's lives.  No, not idiots.  They did not look into what they were doing.  No, the people who worked in Enron didn't know.  The people, they did not know.  The underlings at Enron don't know anything.  That they put their entire retirement portfolio in one company is stupid.  They didn't put their entire, they were given options.  They were like, oh, and it's all going well.  And the federal government stood around and went, it's all going well.  And Arthur Anderson, that son of a bitch.  What a, you know, that, why didn't we just do that for a living? 
[01:36:30]  Norton, who never went to, you could have, we could have done that.  If they needed somebody who couldn't have had, had numbers, any one of us in the room could have done that.  He said, oh, look, here, I don't know.  Oh, it's 18 billion.  I could have written the number down.  He almost said Norton, who's an idiot, could have done that.  Yeah, I know.  I heard that.  I did.  I almost did.  Lewis, you wound up.  Stump shot.  Stump shot.  Come on.  You're all wound up.  The stump is right.  Oh, I can't.  The bottom looks like I'm Dr. Pepper. 
[01:37:00]  What is it?  Why are you trying to do this to me?  Well, you can already see what condition I'm in.  Lewis, we'll all do one together.  We'll bond today.  It's going to look like the bottom of an apple after it's been sitting on a table.  Oh.  Soft and nearly.  Oh, my God.  Okay, hold on.  Let's go over here.  We're filming this.  It'll be up on soundyourmusic.com.  That's as much as I mean.  We got Emma, and the stump is on the table.  Hey, you got a kneecap there, huh?  I do.  I have a knee.  Wow, that's pretty lucky.  Oh, very, very.  That you got the knee.  Incredibly lucky.  Yeah.  Actually, when I first got into the hospital, they thought they were going to have to amputate 
[01:37:30]  both my legs above the knee.  Really?  Yeah.  So I walked out of there so lucky.  Well, rolled out of there.  They amputated Ted Williams' head, so he wasn't as lucky.  Oh, we got to ask Lewis about Ted Williams in a minute.  Oh, yeah.  But first, we need to do a stump shot here.  Stump shot.  We calm everyone down.  Stump shot.  I watched it.  It's all clean.  All squeaky clean.  Squeaky clean.  That's good.  And Devin.  Devin, who was buzzed in Home Alone, the Home Alone movies, will now do a stump shot. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, all right.  Well, maybe we should disinfect him.  I think he's sick of hearing that he was buzzed from Home Alone now that he's 38 years old  or whatever he is.  25, dude.  38.  Jeez.  I'm just kidding.  Movie came out in 62.  I remember it well.  All right.  That and Sundance Kid.  Devin, you ready for this stump shot?  How do I do it?  This is a first for the O&A show.  Get Ken and Scott from Crystal Nothing in here, man.  It kind of smells.  Hold on.  They got to see this.  Oh, does it?  Yeah, it's funky. 
[01:38:30]  A little funky?  It's a little funky.  Is that what that smell is?  Yeah, yeah.  Uh-oh.  She's got cranky stump.  Oh, do you got cranky stump?  She told us.  I told you.  Do you use little wipes?  I wash it all up and everything, but the sock is made out of rubber, so the sock itself  smells a little bit.  It stinks a little bit?  It's not the actual leg.  Stump stink.  Yeah.  A little stump stink.  That's all right.  The booze will cut it.  The booze will cut it.  If you were wearing a piece of plastic on your hand 24 hours a day.  I wear a condom all the time and my junk stinks.  There you go.  I'm wearing one right now. 
[01:39:00]  I'll say.  All right, look, look, look.  Now my leg smells.  Devin will just take one for the team, Devin.  It'll be over before you know it, okay?  Don't worry about it.  Just hold your nose, Devin.  Take a drink off the rotting leg.  You guys are like crotting at hemorrhoids like every day in here.  A little stump shot should not be phasing you guys at all.  Exactly.  Who cares if it's soft and mealy and rotting?  Take a smoke.  All right, you know, I'm a little excited about it, actually.  Are you?  I'm a little excited about it.  I get that stump back on the table.  As long as the 151, we just swab it down some 151.  You know, get rid of it.  There you go.  Swab down that stump. 
[01:39:30]  All right, get a napkin.  Rick, yeah, swab it down.  Get a napkin and wipe it off.  It's like a watch band.  Wipe that stump.  It looks like no one knows how to do stump shots around here, Anthony.  She's got a whole...  I know.  Come on.  How many people have you been to?  How do you do stump shots?  She's rubbing down her stump with the 151.  Look at that big bolt coming out of it.  Wow.  Wow.  That's something.  What happened?  She's more mobile with one leg than I am with all of them.  Yeah.  You know, it's sad.  It's really sad.  Oh, wow.  I'm kind of turned on by the scars. 
[01:40:00]  All right.  Here we go.  Dancing.  All right.  Put it right in that little kneecap pocket she's got going there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ready.  Ready?  Yeah, Devin.  All right, Devin.  Here we go.  Devin, you've got to get right down there because a lot of it's going to run down into our cup.  Here we go.  Yeah, it's going to...  Go ahead.  Dump it on the stump.  All right.  Go ahead.  Stump shot.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, look at him sucking up that booze off the stump.  Our first for the O&A show.  Stump shot.  Stump shot.  That wasn't too bad, man.  No? 
[01:40:30]  No.  No, it's pretty good.  And you know what?  The rubber adds a little flavor to it.  It's nice, man.  Wow.  And by the way, can I take this time to say I know Lewis Black.  We did a one-act play together about three years ago.  I was doing the Kentucky Cycles and you did it.  Everyone stop kissing Lewis Black's ass.  What was the name of the play?  My Head is Large and You're Hyper?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, yeah, that.  I forgot all about that.  Nice.  Oh, well, thank you.  Emma, the star of the party so far.  Stump shot.  Stump shot. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah.  If only Mabel King were here, we could do two at one time.  Pushing both into an elevator shaft.  It's the first time I've ever partaken in a stump shot, so I want to thank you guys.  All right, Emma.  Hop on out of here.  Get back into the party.  Okay, I'm hopping out, but do I get...  Can I have another Dr. Pepper before I leave?  Yeah, if we got Ken or Scott from Crystal Method, we're using their recipe today.  Oh, could you do one thing before you put your leg back on?  Could you just hop up and down for a second?  Yeah.  Come on, that's how the gook laughs at you.  Come on, do it.  Do it for Manny.  That's how the gook dance.  That's how the gook dances. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, you're doing it.  Oh, my God, you're doing it.  Dance!  I'm an effort to dance!  Let's do this whole village.  Hey, somebody get Lieutenant Dan a drink.  Lieutenant Dan.  Scott.  I have a drink, Bill.  I have many drinks.  It's all good.  Scott, we need your recipe.  We need another round of Flaming Dr. Pepper.  Another round, another round.  As Ken continues to spin outside the studio.  Crystal Method, the house band today.  Lewis.  Lewis.  Scott, nice to meet you.  Everyone, nice to meet you.  Lewis, what if we make a light one for you? 
[01:42:00]  Guaranteed I will dance harder than all those girls out there, and I got one left.  All right, hop out there.  Everyone move over, Mike.  Lewis.  Yeah.  What do you think of the Ted Williams thing?  He's frozen right now.  Good, huh?  That's a good idea.  That was a good son.  Wait, do we have the...  Talk about...  Hold on, we have the clip of...  Evil Spawn.  ...of Ted's daughter.  Evil Spawn, and then the daughter's also mildly psychotic.  Yeah, listen to this.  You got to pull the music down, though, because the dramatic music.  For a second, for a second.  Listen, listen.  Here we go.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body. 
[01:42:30]  We can freeze his head.  You put the O&A twist on, Lewis.  That was sick.  It's like a horror movie.  Oh, man.  Ted Williams' head.  Man.  Oh, man.  With offspring like that, why would you ever want to clone Ted Williams?  Man.  Oh, man.  No kidding.  You know what I'm saying?  The DNA seems a little messed up to begin with.  Why didn't you just have him sign 30,000 baseballs before he popped off?  I know. 
[01:43:00]  This is your last chance.  Yeah.  Hey, that was perfect timing.  That was excellent.  No, that's what the son was doing.  Yeah.  The son would not allow anyone to come into the house because he was suspicious that these  people were coming in to get Ted's autograph.  And the son figured out a long time ago, less autographs on the market, more they're worth.  So he held him like hostage.  He pretty much held him like hostage.  Wouldn't let him sign autographs, but made him sign bats and balls and everything.  Right.  And he pretty much has all the Ted Williams autographs, at least from the last 10, 15 years. 
[01:43:30]  And now he's a genius because now he has the biggest baseball memorabilia thing ever,  an actual frozen ball player.  He's got his dad.  He's not good.  That story about him trying to reanimate him in the future, that's a bunch of bull.  He has him frozen.  So in the future, someday, when this all blows over, he can sell him to somebody and you  can just prop him up in your house.  Well, it just goes beyond anything that you ever imagined someone, you know, it's just 
[01:44:00]  every time you turn around, you think it's nuts and it always will go further.  What does Martin Landau want?  Eddie.  Eddie, I don't feel good.  Eddie.  Who's the...  Another old guy.  Bucky, what's wrong?  What's wrong with Bucky?  Bucky, get on mic.  Get on mic.  This is fine.  This is just beautiful.  What's wrong?  No, no.  This is just great.  It's just...  I got the stuff from Guitar Center.  That's all that matters, right?  Yeah, there you go.  You hooked us up. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah.  He's fine.  All right.  You're having a good time.  Who is the sling?  Who is the sling?  Bucky, you want a stump shot?  No stump shots for Bucky?  Who is the sling?  All right.  In a while, we're going to be doing two pay shots.  It's Tuesday.  And it's only Tuesday.  I thought they weren't replacing the rug out there.  Eddie, let's shoot this f***er.  It looks just like Marvel.  Boris Karloff.  Karloff couldn't eat my f***er.  Take the red pill. 
[01:45:00]  Take the red pill.  Take the red pill.  Take the red pill.  One of the Lego people.  You stay in Wonderland.  Lego hair shots.  You stay in Wonderland.  And I show you how decent...  Home.  I have no home.  All right.  So, I guess that's what we got on Ted Williams and his frozen head there.  Well, what did you do?  It's all frozen, Bob.  So, are we plugging anything today?  No, I just came in.  Oh, good.  Of course he did.  You're not plugging August 10th in Red Bank, my gig? 
[01:45:30]  Count Basie Theater?  Let's go to the phone and see what's going on.  You came in not to do anything fun and cool, but just to hang out.  Like Stump Shots or Flaming Dr. Peppers.  When was the last time, outside of getting busted, have I done anything fun or cool?  Except to just come in and see you guys.  Yeah, but that's why you're getting arrested for the show.  That's ancient history.  Ah, gee.  You've got to up your membership with the O.N.A. show.  I'm not...  No, I've got a permanent membership. 
[01:46:00]  You've got to re-up your membership.  I'm thinking Stump Shot for Lewis.  Oh, no.  Hey, let's go to the phones.  Russ, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, O?  Hey, Anthony.  Yo, I'm watching ESPN, and they've got a new episode of More Sports on.  Yeah.  I thought it was...  No, it's on, like, right now, though.  Yeah.  Well, I figured you guys...  We might all want to rip on O for his soccer NBA thing while Crystal Mets is there.  There's a lot of controversy. 
[01:46:30]  I guess there's a More Sports on right now.  But Jay told me and everyone else around here that I'm going to be on Tonight at 10 on ESPN.  Tonight at 10.  It's a brand...  I kid you not.  It's a brand new show.  Who's the guest?  I kid you not.  It's a brand new show.  They're talking about the Masters during its opening stand-up, which was just this past weekend,  so it's got to be now.  No, the Masters was a month ago.  Not the Masters.  I'm sorry.  The British Open.  Oh, the British Open.  So who's the guest?  It's Don King right now.  I'm watching it right now.  Oh, my God.  That's the one I'm on.  Oh, my God. 
[01:47:00]  Maybe they're running it twice.  Oh, boy.  Huh?  Did you meet Don King?  No.  Yeah, they're going to commercial break right now.  He filmed this thing a while ago.  Hey, get ESPN on this thing, please.  All right, thank you, Russ.  No problem, man.  I don't know.  I might be on ESPN in the next few minutes.  Oh, my goodness.  I play the WNBA Stalker in one of Jay Moore's bits on ESPN.  It might be on in a few minutes, Anthony.  I don't know.  A lot of controversy.  I thought it was on tonight at 10.  Maybe they do that preview thing to fill some time first, and then you see it at 10. 
[01:47:30]  I don't know.  I'm looking forward to singing it.  This guy is saying I'll be on in five minutes.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, Joe.  Hey, no.  ESPN is preempting it tonight.  They have Baseball Tonight on at 10, and some show called The Life on at 9.30.  So they push this back to 5 o'clock.  You got Stefan Marbury and King on.  Yeah, that's the show I'm supposed to be on.  Right.  The first skit he did was something to do with steroids, and then he's got, I guess, you  know, he does a skit at the end.  So you should be on in about four or five minutes.  All right. 
[01:48:00]  Thank you, bro.  Oh, boy.  I guess I...  Acting.  Yeah, a little acting.  A little acting.  Very nice.  I'm in a little skit there, Lewis.  They said it's funny.  I don't know.  We'll see.  Delete the laugh with me or acting.  Acting.  Acting.  Wow.  What a...  Oh, well.  Perfect.  I know.  Now no one's going to see it.  You got it.  Did you tape it?  Did you set the VCR in the back?  All right.  Good.  Good move.  We'll take it right now.  We'll get it up on foundyourmusic.com.  There's five flaming darts and peppers lit. 
[01:48:30]  Oh.  Ready to go.  Over there?  Over here.  All right.  I guess I got to go over there and do one.  Come on, now.  Lewis?  You're going to do one.  Yeah.  He's been doing them all day.  Come on, Lewis.  All right.  Come on, Lewis.  Lewis, I'll do it.  I'm doing it.  I'm doing it.  I'll do it.  Hold on.  Dive into that blackout head first.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  Okay.  Here we go.  Now be careful.  Let's not set anything on fire.  Hold the glass steady.  Grab this.  Uh-oh.  Make sure it goes up.  Ah, someone's on fire. 
[01:49:00]  Make sure it goes up before it goes through your face.  It's on fire.  Here we go.  On three.  One, two, three.  Drink it all the way down.  Now drink the whole thing.  This is great.  Rock.  Hold the weight.  Hold the weight.  Oh, my goodness.  Come on, Lewis.  Now.  Lewis.  We have arrived.  Lewis Black.  Lewis Black.  The crystal meth and par.  Oh, my God.  This is wrong.  This is wrong.  In two minutes.  Do you smell the burning hair here in the studio? 
[01:49:30]  Is it my hair?  My arm was on fire.  Hey, listen.  Who's the bitch that set me on fire?  She did.  No, it's a splash.  What happens is it's a splash.  No, no, no.  It's before that.  She got nervous with her shot.  No, she got nervous.  She got all nervous.  Shook.  And the flames hit my arm.  You better drink out of my mule to apologize.  What?  Lewis.  Lewis, what do you think of that?  It's good.  That's good, isn't it?  It's tasty.  Right about now, the 151 starts to rise up to your chest.  No, it's very good.  You feel really good.  No, it's a solid drink.  It's a heartburn that no raw lads could fix. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, man.  It's a solid drink.  I'm on ESPN right now, Anthony.  There he is.  Oh, there you are.  Can we turn it up?  Everybody rushes to the monitors.  Oh, my God.  And shock us with your made-up stories about sleeping with the point guard.  You attend every home game and linger around for hours afterwards, all in the hopes  of asking Lisa Leslie why she hasn't returned to any of your middle-of-the-night phone calls.  Because you just want to be her friend. 
[01:50:30]  Because you just want to be her friend.  Because you just want to be her friend.  Oh, no.  More sports salutes you.  I'm on ESPN right now.  Oh, my God.  All right.  It's a privilege to introduce my next guest. 
[01:51:00]  He's one of the first.  Oh my goodness, you look like such a tool.  What a creep you look like.  We only saw the second half of that.  You did that a little too well.  A little too well.  You lunatic.  I thought it was on 10 o'clock tonight.  Oh, wow.  They had to move it up for 5 so the kids could see it.  Corinne, you leaving us?  Why?  You're not having fun?  I am having fun.  You got to take a dump? 
[01:51:30]  Wait, what?  Tug into the mic.  Bye.  I had a lot of fun.  What do you got to do?  Why are you leaving early?  Apartment search?  You could stay with Jimmy.  Oh, yeah.  You could stay on our couch for a while.  Stay with the crystal method.  Follow them.  I'm a great guy to stay with.  You never have to get up to use the toilet.  I can't believe I got set on fire.  If Corinne leaves, whose body are we going to use for the body shots?  Jimmy?  You can't take your body with you. 
[01:52:00]  You have a deep belly button?  Yeah.  You do one out of my balloon nut.  Pour a little water in there and lick.  All right.  Well, we got to say goodbye to Corinne.  Corinne, thank you.  It was fun.  Thank you for the use of your body.  Whoops.  Oh.  Well, that probably won't get through.  Yeah, yeah.  That didn't make the air.  Was that little lick that you mentioned before an unexpected pleasure?  Yeah.  Was it good?  It was good.  Yeah.  I enjoyed it.  I always enjoy that.  All right.  That's always good. 
[01:52:30]  Well, there you go.  I just want to give a shout out.  Oh, oh.  Shout out?  To R.C.  The cola.  Yes.  That's a great cola.  You can tell me about the WOW contest.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  We're losing Corinne.  There she goes.  All right.  Thanks.  And her body.  So now we need a new body for body shots.  Give it up to Corinne.  She's a beautiful girl.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Bye.  We need another chick.  Yeah.  Corinne.  All right.  We've got to get another.  My lips are a little bit tingly after that stump shot. 
[01:53:00]  Is it?  My lips are a little bit tingly.  I wonder.  Is that like residue of the rubber or something?  No.  It's probably nerves.  Yeah.  You're all freaked out that you kissed a stump.  No.  I'm all right with that.  Maybe the 151 proof.  Oh, yeah.  That's something to do with your lips tingling.  All right.  Your lips tingling.  It's the 151.  Blood and tissue just kind of pool up in there.  It's stump fungus.  You're going to have a cold sore later on tonight.  That stump.  They can't hear out there because the music's so loud.  That stump stunk.  Yeah.  That was a stinky stump.  It was the stump.  It stunk.  Did the shot? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, I did the shot.  He did the stump shot.  Yeah, I know.  Right?  Hey, let's go to Erica.  What's up, Erica?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey, Opie.  Just saw you on more sports, and I wanted to congratulate you on your Emmy-nominating performance.  I'm sure.  Yeah, thank you.  And I want to know who you're going to take to the Emmys next year, you know, because that's a big deal.  Emmy Award winner.  Yeah, it's definitely Emmy Award for, what is it, a variety show, I think?  I looked ridiculous.  That's all right, but those were nice glasses, I want to say.  And Norton, you rule? 
[01:54:00]  Thank you.  You're welcome.  I'm not getting any box at the party.  That's all right.  You'll get some later.  If not, you can just pay for it, right?  All right, Erica.  Thank you.  So good one, guys.  Going up next, Beth.  She's coming in with her own material.  That's right.  Beth from Alexandria, Virginia, saying, Opie, as the NBA stalker, looked like the guy who  jacked it on Whitney Houston's bed in the bodyguard.  All right, I could see that.  I looked like Anthony Michael Hall playing Bill Gates.  Oh, yes.  Nice glasses, dick. 
[01:54:30]  I looked like the lead singer of Fish.  Yes.  Wow.  Two nice glasses, dicks.  Hey, Steve Johnson, what's up?  Steve.  Steve.  There we go.  You just hung up.  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  All right, we should take a break.  Yeah, I guess.  Louis, did you like that, though?  That's like a nice shot.  You would think it's a good shot.  You would think it was going to be a lot stronger or worse than it is?  It's actually better.  They do a lot of those.  There's a lot of those kind of shots where they throw one of those things.  Oh, now you're a pro.  You did one, and now you're a pro.  You know, I told you before we started this nonsense, okay? 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  I said I drink, and I don't fool around when I drink.  I've been there at Caroline's after a set, and I've, yes.  But I saw, I'm telling you, I've had certain things like this in my journey.  Louis is the guy that pours his beer out when you're not looking.  Yeah.  Oh, I hate that guy.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Louis is that guy.  The guy that holds his shot in his mouth and spits it back out into the drink.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I hate that guy.  This is Jennifer from Family Tide.  No, no.  Louis is the guy that throws the shot on the floor when everyone else goes to their mouth. 
[01:55:30]  No, I'm the guy who stands there and talks totally lucidly until the point where I go,  and then I have to walk out.  Any minute now, he's going to pull out his mule and start screaming the N-word.  Oh, that is so wrong.  Inappropriate.  Inappropriate.  That is so wrong.  All right, we've got to check in with the girls, see if they're having a good time with the party.  Scott's in the studio from Crystal Method.  How's it going out there, Scott? 
[01:56:00]  It's very dark out there.  Yeah.  There's no smoke.  Oh, is Earl out there?  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought you meant...  Okay.  It's like the lights are off.  The lights are off.  I'm sorry.  Ding, ding.  Inappropriate, Bill.  Come on now.  Hey.  I want to mingle a little over me.  Let's go mingle.  During break, I'm going to walk.  I'm going to mingle.  I want to get the old feel of the scene out there.  Okay.  I want to get the glow sticks.  Sure.  Why not?  Why not?  Oh, my God.  Glow sticks.  You didn't get your glow stick when you came in here today? 
[01:56:30]  No, I didn't get the glow stick.  You want me to do a glow stick show for you?  Right in front of your face.  I get two inches in front of your face and wave them around.  You know, that was, you know, when I woke up this morning, I was hoping this would happen.  All right.  We got Crystal Method.  They're the house band today.  We want to thank you guys.  They're spinning live as we try to do a radio show.  Yes, of course.  Yeah, but he's here all the time.  No.  Well, we're not here all the time with Lewis Black. 
[01:57:00]  This is a privilege.  Well, and I'll make another Flaming Dog pepper if we can get some more amaretto.  Yes.  We need some more amaretto.  I'll buy.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  You can come up and hang out with the one-legged chick if you bring you some amaretto.  So, come on in.  I don't mean that in a bad way.  I don't mean to insult you.  That's okay.  I'm used to it now.  All right.  No, I'm used to it.  All right.  Crystal Method, their new CD is in stores today.  Community service, and they're doing an in-store at Virgin Megastore, Union Square, tonight at 730.  They're going to be pretty effed up by the time they get there. 
[01:57:30]  And they're playing New York City Friday at Centro Fly.  Ben, we've got to plug a few things here, right?  Yeah, this is Dennis, who provided all the lights and everything.  Great job, man.  Lights, lasers, visuals, age-infested puppets.  Yeah.  He's doing a Pablo.  That took you a while or something?  Because I'm noticing pictures out there that you got off of the website and graphics and everything.  Pretty cool.  We did some custom stuff for you guys for Norton, so maybe I can get a tussle or something like that.  You have no hair to tussle. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, I know, you know, but we did a collage of the WoW contestants.  We have a bunch of cool WoW graphics.  See, the guy knew it was coming up, and he worked at it, man.  Yeah, we had a little time.  We put some time into it.  We catered to all the raves and clubs and all that kind of stuff out there.  I mean, I've been with you guys since you came to WNEW, and you've entertained me too many times for me not to hook you guys up.  Well, you did a great job.  Thanks.  Thank you.  And the only problem we have is with the smoke, but we have a hazer.  It's not necessarily a smoke machine.  A hazer.  A hazer.  Pete Johnson was giving us trouble.  You can't use the hazer. 
[01:58:30]  I don't know what it'll do to my valuable equipment.  And we've got to thank Guitar Center, Anthony.  Yeah.  The musician's choice on Route 4 in Paramus, New Jersey.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  Now I understand how you end up on radio.  That's why the tags are still on all the gear out there.  Dick.  Yeah.  Let's do an attitude walk around the club, man.  Yeah, we're going to do that, and we'll continue with the O.P. Anthony show.  Well, as Crystal Method continues to spin for us today.  You're getting married.  No, no. 
[01:59:00]  Here's Anthony from the O.P. Anthony show to help you plan the perfect wedding.  I'm talking to you.  Are you listening?  First, you must carefully choose a wedding ring for your gal.  I went into one of those jewelry stores in Penn Station, and I think I spent $300 on it.  Right.  Well, you should also make sure your betrothed gets along with your dear, sweet mother.  Your son is a scumbag.  Eh, maybe not. 
[01:59:30]  Your wedding night, on the other hand, should be a magical one.  I believe I laid there looking at the ceiling with tears of regret and sorrow rolling down the sides of my face.  Just follow these simple steps, and you'll have the perfect wedding.  Just like...  Eh, I got nothing.  I was shocked.  I was horrified.  I was broke.  Hopeless.  What did I get myself into?  It only took nine and a half years for me to leave. 
[02:00:00]  Never marry a lot!  Hey, it's the retarded Laverne and Shirley, and you're listening to Ophie and Anthony on 94 WISP.  You're crazy.  Man, Martin.  Pritchell Method's spinning.  People outside the studio.  It's 540 in New York.  It's pitch dark in here.  Pitch dark outside the studio.  It's a nice vibe in here.  I was outside, and Big Kev got a light stick, and he was doing one of the light dances around his head with the light stick. 
[02:00:30]  Everyone looking.  It's a regular party out there.  Right on.  Steve Johnson, what's going on?  Mr. Hughes.  Yes, Steve.  I was switching phones before.  I heard it on the radio.  I apologize.  What?  I heard it on the radio.  I was switching phones and switching rooms.  I apologize.  Who are you?  Well, producer, actually.  Very interesting what you did.  I thought it was fantastic.  Kind of a cross between James Spader character in Sex Slides and Videotape and Fredo from The Godfather.  It was great.  A lot of people say that I look like the lead singer of Fish. 
[02:01:00]  Fish.  I look like Andy Dick.  I look like Kurt Cobain after a lot of heroin.  I am definitely here to punt.  You are the punts.  Pumts.  What the hell is that?  I just got the friends-only speech from a girl.  I am a real loser.  Well, during spots.  Loser.  Jim's working it.  He's working the room.  He's in the club.  He's roaming around.  It's pitch black out there.  Someone wanted to take a picture and Kev grabbed the camera. 
[02:01:30]  It's that dark.  You cannot see out there.  And Jim's working it.  So he's working one of the girls.  And he found out that friends.  I don't think of you that way.  It's a girl I know.  I didn't ask her.  It actually came out.  It was a girl I know, actually.  I didn't just hear her.  Yeah.  And what did she say to you?  Ant's girlfriend should get team player of the year.  Because she's like, well, would you kiss him?  Like, just joking around.  Trying to work it for him.  He's really good.  Helping out. 
[02:02:00]  And she's like, well, no, he's a nice guy.  But I don't look at him like that.  And before the sentence was finished, back to the studio.  Well, that's a good thing.  Because now we're trying to do a radio show today.  Oh, phenomenal.  No, no.  I mean, I was here before that.  Ah, what a time saver that is.  All right.  Now he's moving on.  Oh, then she'll wonder, why did he never acknowledge me again?  Well, we've got a bunch of things going on here, Ant.  We've got Crystal Method as our house band today.  Let's not forget, they've got a new CD.  It's in stores now, community service.  They're doing an in-store at 730 at the Virgin Megastore in Union Square here in New York City. 
[02:02:30]  They're playing Friday night at Central Fly in New York City.  And also, we've got to promote another CD today.  Yeah.  Louis Black casually hands me his latest CD during commercials.  Very cool.  That just came out.  It's called The End of the Universe, the brand new CD from Louis Black.  Your last one was hilarious.  I played it a lot.  Louis has a website, lewisblack.net.  Oh, one of those .net.  That .com thing is a fad.  Well, that .com thing, a lawyer took it.  And then tried to sell it to me. 
[02:03:00]  Louis has this bit that he does.  You know, I won't give it away.  Well, whatever.  I guess I do it in a way.  He talks about a Starbucks across the street from another Starbucks.  Yeah.  Louis, I've seen you probably two dozen times.  Yeah.  I've seen you do that bit a few times.  I was thinking you were just making that up.  Like, okay, this is kind of just funny for, you know, a comedy routine.  Yeah.  No, the cover of a CD shows the Starbucks across the street from another Starbucks.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's in Houston. 
[02:03:30]  And it's the most.  That Starbucks on the right is the Starbucks that makes the most money of all the Starbucks in the United States.  And what about the other one?  The other one probably, you know, does okay.  The other one does.  Why would they choose one over the other?  How the hell?  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, that's something.  Have you ever been to the South and seen the Waffle House?  Oh, yeah.  They're on both exits across the street from each other.  Oh, yeah.  Both off ramps.  Yeah, but that makes sense.  Have a Waffle House.  Yeah, but that makes sense.  They're 200 yards away from each other.  Yeah, but that makes sense.  They're serving food. 
[02:04:00]  There's a reason to go to both of them.  There's food there.  You know, there's food.  There's food.  I personally, I love the Waffle House.  Do you?  Yep.  All right.  Yep.  If you can get that much fat into the human system and keep going, you can't beat it.  There's no better source of grease than the Waffle House.  I noticed about those places, though, like Waffle House or even the IHOP, don't the plates  and glasses stink?  They smell like eggs.  Yes.  Like, they never get them clean enough.  Not to mention the waitresses and the stumps. 
[02:04:30]  Big beehive hairdo flow looking waitresses.  Yeah.  You're a good customer, but I really don't look at you that way.  He's still all annoyed.  Just give her one more drink, Norton.  So what's going on outside?  The girls having a good time?  Oh, yes.  We're having a good time.  Anything that we can exploit?  Nobody saw me.  Never mind.  All right.  Wow.  How many have you had? 
[02:05:00]  Not enough, obviously.  He needs one more.  Come on, Ken.  Were you in on that last one?  No.  Ken, you weren't in there?  Where I got set on fire?  Oh, that's right.  Because the whole ESPN thing went down, and we were talking about Anthony's  arm going on fire.  Yeah.  And then Ben on the air.  Oh, I was on fire.  I burned hair off my arm.  Fantastic.  And Ben or somebody else, their shot got all...  Ben's fingers?  Flaming.  He drops it, and then the whole countertop was on fire as well, Anthony.  Well, a nice area.  It was a nice blue flame fire, bro. 
[02:05:30]  It goes out quick.  It goes out quick.  It goes out fast.  Ben's like, no, don't say that.  It's a cold flame.  If they were going to shut us down, they were going to shut us down already, Ben.  Yeah, really?  Ben's like, ah, ah, ah.  The place is going to get raided by the end of the show.  Yeah.  We're drinking off of a...  Drinking off of a stump.  You know, the fire's...  Not you.  Oh, well, hello.  Yeah, not you.  Lewis.  Yeah, not me.  Lewis.  Lewis.  I said they are drinking off a stump.  Do a stump shot.  I'm not doing a stump shot.  Come on, be a good guy. 
[02:06:00]  No.  I have to bring her back in here, because that stump really stunk.  Yeah.  That was a stinky stump.  I'm just thinking, if Lewis does a stump shot, though...  Think of the material for the routine, Ben.  No.  I licked beer off a stump.  They'll still talk about us.  Those idiots wanted me to...  And her little stump thing was pointing like your finger when she was wiggling her leg.  That was exciting.  What was that little spring thing she had on the end of the...  It was like a bolt.  She bolts the leg to that.  Yeah.  That's great if you're traveling. 
[02:06:30]  Fantastic.  That was fantastic.  That was on the roof.  Rick wants to say something.  Yes, Rick.  Yeah, remember the other day when we were qualifying girls, and you said that the girl who said  she was five feet is really 4'11"?  Oh, $100 bet on this.  Yeah.  She's standing outside.  Okay.  Where's a tape measure?  And she wants to come in.  All right, bring her in.  Get Pete.  Get a tape measure.  Yeah.  There was a $100 bet on this.  She called in and said she was five feet tall.  Opie's limit for height was five feet tall.  Wow, you're the girl that's supposed to fight?  Yeah, see?  You are so hot. 
[02:07:00]  You were telling her she wasn't supposed to come here.  So Opie said, I bet, he said girls that say they're five feet tall are never five feet  tall.  They're 4'11".  Oh, you brought your own $100 too?  Oh, that means I lose.  And we all bet Opie, we all bet Opie that she was indeed five feet tall.  You guys forgot.  Well, we're busy doing stump tracks and stuff.  Imagine you almost turned her down for height.  Look at you.  Hi, ladies.  Right? 
[02:07:30]  She's got a big chest there.  She's got a new friend, yeah.  Well, very good eyes.  Sure does.  Thank God for Dr. Philadelphia.  You noticed that.  Thank you, Diamond Vision.  We might have found a new body for the body shots.  Oh, would you be into letting some of the ladies maybe do body shots off of you?  Or Crystal Method or Stinky.  Clear the feel.  Clear the feel.  Clear the feel.  Time for more body shots.  I don't drink alcohol.  Oh, I know.  I forgot.  Dump some water on it.  I'd love to lick it off. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  We'll measure in a little bit.  Yeah, we have the tape measure.  We'll measure her in a bit.  But why isn't someone rushing over to clear off a spot on the console for her to lay up  there?  There we go.  Move them aside.  Louis, you are going to have the best view.  I'm just glad I don't have to clean up.  You are going to have the best view of this.  Rob wants in real fast on the phone.  Rob, what's going on?  What are you doing?  I just wanted to comment on that Starbucks thing, you know?  Yeah, Starbucks.  I thought it was a joke, too.  But then I was walking down Astor Place right in the city once, right by that big cube thing, 
[02:08:30]  you know?  Uh-huh.  One in front of me, one in back of me.  It's the end of the world.  So there is a Starbucks across the street from the...  Starbucks in New York City.  In New York City.  Right by that big cube.  Nice.  That is wild.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  No problem.  Later.  Oh, you've got to respect this cube.  Yeah.  We've got the five-foot girl on the counter for a body shot.  Now, isn't that shirt going to soak up all the booze?  Isn't that going to be horrible?  Holy Toledo. 
[02:09:00]  I think that might be bad.  Yeah.  You're wearing a bra, right?  You got a bra on?  It's like a bathing suit top.  So just, yeah, just the shirt.  Yeah.  That we start with.  Yeah.  Oh, boy, are those yummy.  Oh, shit.  Look at Lewis.  Look at Lewis.  Take your bra off and take it off now.  I'm with Vince.  All right.  The...  It's all gooey.  The Sammy Hagar tequila.  There it goes.  The Cabo Wabo tequila has made its way to the Bate. 
[02:09:30]  I really want to relapse.  Oh, she's licking a little salt off of her body and now digging in for the shot.  Yeah.  Get a good one.  Very nice.  Get a picture of that, please, for the website.  Wow, Lewis.  Nice.  Nice tattoo on the back there.  Costa Rica.  Lewis.  Lewis.  Lewis.  Lewis.  Lewis.  Come on, Lewis.  Hustle.  Come on, Lewis.  Lewis, what? 
[02:10:00]  What, are you a faggot?  Yeah.  Lewis, I'll give you a real nice plug for your CD.  Thank you.  Plus, Red Bank.  Lewis, what are you...  Go ahead.  What's the problem you have with sucking booze out of a beautiful girl's belly button?  I just got stuff to do.  You got stuff to do.  You know, look...  What, are you running for office someday?  What?  Go ahead, Angel.  Oh, she's at...  Look at the cleavage.  You're looking right down at cleavage.  She's asking you to. 
[02:10:30]  Lewis.  Lewis, it's so easy.  How do I end up being the worst?  Because the girl wants you to.  Boy, we're just torturing you, aren't we, Lewis?  You really are.  We throw a beautiful girl right in front of him, laying down.  She wants him to suck booze out of her belly button, and you're saying no?  Well, yeah, that's an interesting point.  It's not a guy, Lewis.  It's a girl.  Even you're thinking about it now.  Like, why the hell am I saying no?  How about if we get Jamaican Mike and let you do a line off his mule?  Here he goes.  The headphones are off.  All right.  Pour it out, Rick.  Pour it out, Rick.  That is kind of stupid. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, it is.  When you think about it...  Here you go.  Here you go, Lewis.  Lewis is making his way to the body shot, girl.  You analyze things too much.  There we go.  A little tequila.  Oh, wait, wait.  You didn't do this.  Oh, yeah.  You didn't do the salt.  The salt.  Oh, Lewis.  I know that.  Well, you can...  All right, do another.  All right, you got to do the salt.  You got to lick a little salt off.  There you go.  Wow, Lewis.  Oh, wow.  Relax on the salt. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  Lewis.  Lewis.  Lewis Black.  I never saw anyone lick salt with three fingers before.  Save some for the rest of us, Lewis.  Are you hot?  Oh, man.  That was good.  I am in such trouble right now.  That's good stuff.  I love Cabo Wabo.  Cabo Wabo.  Great tequila.  And out of her navel, it was really perfect.  Yes.  I'm a man of my word, Lewis.  Lewis has a new CD out called The End of the Universe.  I'm telling you guys, the last CD was hilarious. 
[02:12:00]  This one's going to be just as good, if not better.  Go to lewisblack.net to check out The End of the Universe.  I've actually heard this, and it is hilarious.  Very good.  Very good.  Thanks, guys.  Okay.  It's brilliant.  Oh, my God.  We haven't taken a break in a long time.  You are just postponing the measuring of that girl, because it's going to cost you money,  and you know it.  Who did I bet?  I bet you.  You bet me $100.  Ahem.  Jim?  Norton, $100.  And you bet her $100.  And you bet her $100.  It's going to cost you three beans, dude. 
[02:12:30]  Did I bet you $100, too?  Oh.  Oh, man.  She was the first one, and then everyone else said, I'm in.  If you cost me $100, I'm teabagging you.  All right.  This has to be done right.  You know what we've got to do?  Why don't we take a break, and we'll measure her next, okay?  Yeah, we'll figure it out.  We've got to set up the whole thing.  And that gives us a reason to come back.  Of course.  Thank God.  It's called the radio tease.  Way to go.  You are good at this.  No one's going to turn off their radio, because we're going to measure a girl next.  Wow.  That's exciting radio. 
[02:13:00]  Welcome to the bottomless pit of ignorance.  Opie.  I feel like being an idiot.  Anthony.  I'm a retard.  The Opie and Anthony show.  I think hilarious.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony rock on YSP.  We're calling this the Crystal Method party at this point.  Hell, yeah.  Crystal Method spinning for us all day long today.  Lewis Black.  Oh, yeah.  We found out that Ken and Scott are big fans of Lewis Black on The Daily Show, and look 
[02:13:30]  at what they're playing for you.  Nice.  Very nice.  Let's not forget Crystal Method.  They got a new CD.  It's called Community Service.  It's in record stores today.  They're doing an in-store at Virgin Megastore in Union Square tonight at 730.  They're going to be pretty snotted by the time they get there.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Fezzy's in the studio.  Fez.  I've been trying to get into this party since 3.  Were you waiting outside? 
[02:14:00]  The guy at the rope wouldn't let you in?  I wasn't pretty enough to get into the party.  Aw.  Didn't you tell him who you were?  He finally told me you have to lose that shirt.  Not with that shirt.  You're not getting in here.  I thought it was the shoes.  So, great party, guys.  I'm just sitting out there in the dark like Andy Warhol, just taking it all in.  Did you go to the VIP room where all the action happens, like Studio 54?  You got a nice champagne room working out there.  Well, Fez, what we have here is the crystal method mix of flaming Dr. Peppers. 
[02:14:30]  Nice.  You ready?  I'm into the flaming part.  All right.  Light that one up.  I'm in.  And be very careful now.  I've heard there's...  Well, shouldn't say it.  Ant's telling people to be very careful.  He burned half the hair off his right arm.  Yeah, my arm got burned.  Let's drop him in.  And turn it down.  There they go.  Blaming Dr. Peppers for everybody.  Oh, that's good. 
[02:15:00]  That's good.  You like that?  Well done.  Oh, Jesus.  Woo!  Oh, there's still one flaming.  Watch.  You are the one that burns people, right?  Oh, no.  Something's got a...  Oh, no.  You're the one-legged girl.  Oh, great.  We got a fire starter here.  Hey, Fezzy, you want to do a stump shot?  Stump shot?  She's got one leg.  Really?  There's a girl out in the green room wearing cats on her feet.  Do it over the carpet.  There you go.  There you go.  Whoa, it's still on fire.  She starts drinking it.  She's drinking it on fire. 
[02:15:30]  Nice.  The flaming Moe.  All right.  You want to do a stump shot, Fezzy?  Drinking like she's got a hollow leg.  No?  Has anyone done that yet?  Don't you hate coming in late to a show?  I hate it when I'm late.  I think the last person that did it, we went, oh, the hollow leg thing again.  Not again.  And then you just did it.  Devin from All Along.  He did a stump shot there, Fezzy.  Well, with his career, he should.  Oh, I'm sorry. 
[02:16:00]  I've had a little bit to drink.  I'm getting a little surly.  Hey.  I'm sorry.  You're making fun of us.  This is the A-list celebrities that we know, Fezzy.  You should see the B in the C-list.  Well, last night we talked about sausage.  We can't get a Rutger Howler on our show, okay, Fez?  And leave him alone.  Fezzy's got to do a stump shot.  I'll do a stump shot.  You want to do a stump?  Yeah.  Stump shot.  Fezzy is a trooper.  Get some liquor and a clothespin for your nose. 
[02:16:30]  Fezzy, there is an odor that comes off of the stump.  You got to be honest.  Yeah, no, no, that's all right.  You're fetid, rotting stump.  It's fine.  Yeah, you're fine.  You're fine.  Pop your stump up here.  Wash if she wants to be.  No, no, no.  Fezzy is licked worse.  Trust me.  Some other stinky stumps.  Could you put a German helmet on it?  This is not the stump shot I was thinking about.  I had something completely different in mind.  Want to do the balloon knot volcano? 
[02:17:00]  Why?  That was a dessert I got every year for my birthday.  We need a diabetic Mexican for that.  Pop up.  Oh, my gosh.  There it is.  All right, so your legs off.  Is this the hottest one-layered girl you've ever seen, Fezzy?  Look at her.  She's beautiful.  You really are.  I'm still not believing it.  I just saw you take your leg off.  Acting lessons.  Dancing lessons.  You have to be ready to be an amputee.  Hopping lessons.  What are you saying?  What are you saying?  This is what Paul McCartney does all the time.  Please let me have another stump shot. 
[02:17:30]  I want to drink off your stump.  So pop that stump up on the console.  This is the hit of the party, the stump shot.  Yeah.  She's got, like, Franken-leg.  There's a bolt sticking out of the bottom.  Yeah.  This leg is in, like, eight different pieces.  Yeah.  We're disassembling her.  All right.  She's peeling down her rubber sock stump suction cup thing.  Now, do I drink out of this?  No, you drink off her leg.  Oh, off her leg?  I thought I drank out of the hollow leg. 
[02:18:00]  No, put her leg down.  What do you think that is, the Stanley Cup?  You drink out of it?  Come on.  I love seeing Lois get horrified.  All right.  Boys, I just got a whiff.  I just got a whiff.  She's cleaning the stump.  I'm trying.  I'm doing the one.  Look, come on.  It's not like you never ate rancid meat.  I love how the...  Yes, it is.  I love how the fake leg comes with a shoe and everything.  It's exactly like that.  Already attached.  A shoe.  I just see it drifting to the bottom of the water like in Jaws, that guy on the boat in 
[02:18:30]  the lake.  Nice sneaker tied very tidily on it.  Double-knotted.  Yeah.  We're preparing the stump.  This is so cool.  It reminds me of that football game we used to play with.  No, it doesn't smell fun.  It's like a foosball leg.  Hey, you guys have embarrassed...  She's embarrassed now.  Oh, no.  Don't be embarrassed.  Don't be embarrassed.  Stop.  You're hot.  Don't worry about it.  What am I drinking out of? 
[02:19:00]  Hotness takes...  You're just kind of sucking it off of her knee.  Her knee stump.  Besides, hotness takes away smelliness.  Yeah.  And it's 151, so it burns away everything.  There you go.  Oh, yeah.  Stump shot.  Stump shot for Fezzy.  Fezzy does a stump shot.  I am honored that Fezzy would do a stump shot.  Honey, the alcohol ain't killing the stick.  The alcohol ain't killing it.  Oh, no.  Really? 
[02:19:30]  I need my tongue amputated.  Sorry.  Yeah, that's got to be a bitch when you like sleeping with a guy, right?  Do you scrub it up real good?  It depends.  Like, there was one guy that I was dating that I would not take my leg off in bed for, like, seven months.  Really?  Like, yeah.  I mean, I shower...  To kick him in the sack, you wouldn't even know, though.  Like, sometimes your girls get a little wacky.  I'll shower, like, a million times a day, but it's just when you have a rubber, you know, covering a piece of your body...  Yeah.  ...for that many hours a day, it doesn't matter how many times you wash it, you shower, whatever, it's going to be... 
[02:20:00]  Yeah, but wouldn't you, like, go into the shower, scrub the stump, and then get into bed?  No, I would go into the shower, scrub the stump, put the leg back on, and then get into bed.  Why wouldn't you just leave the leg off?  Because I was self-conscious about it, but...  Grabs, goes to grab both ankles and spins you over.  I actually did have one incident.  Honey, it's a baton with a shoe on.  You're not fooling anybody.  It's not like it's...  It's not like it's lifelike.  No, but the thing is that, like, when you're having sex, like, you want a little bit of... 
[02:20:30]  You know, you need the both legs for the leverage, you know?  Oh, leverage.  Kickstand.  You know, you don't want...  It's a little balance.  All right.  Yeah, a little balance problem.  Too much information.  What you ought to do is climb in bed, pull the covers up, and then keep your leg up by your head so that you look really flexible.  I don't know.  Wow, a gymnast.  That's actually it.  No, but my...  Yeah, my boyfriend now, he's totally chill with it.  You know, I take it off when I go to sleep.  It's all good.  Jimmy just got distracted from a girl that just walked in. 
[02:21:00]  Holy mackerel.  Is she late for the party?  Are you late?  Fashionably late.  She's the seagull girl.  Everything stopped.  A two-legged girl walked in.  Everything stopped.  We're not used to seeing girls with two legs.  I'm sorry.  Ah, the poor one-legged girl.  Come back here.  Drag that thing back in.  We're kidding.  She feels like she's coming up short in this whole thing.  You hop back here right now, Missy.  Lewis, any thoughts?  I'm...  I... 
[02:21:30]  I thought...  All I didn't know is I went to the bathroom, and you're the only people I know.  In the bathroom is an eye, face, and body wash in case of problems.  Emergency.  In case of emergency.  Nowhere else in the entire world, except maybe like a radiation clinic, would somebody need  an eye wash?  Did you open up the medicine thing?  Because in there is a shot of AZT, which comes in very handy when some girls are in here. 
[02:22:00]  You take it quickly.  You're like Magic Johnson.  You go on forever.  We're prepared to give Karen Silkwood showers here.  You have a fire hose in the stairwell.  Whatever it takes, we'll clean you up.  That's right.  Lewis is having fun, though, over there.  I see he is.  He's done the stump shot.  I'm on vacation.  Okay.  He's doing the, uh...  Mike has...  Flaming Dr. Peppers.  Mike has a question on the phone.  Mike?  Come on.  We've got to let her hop away to the Incredible Hulk music.  What are you doing?  Come on.  Oh.  Oh.  You guys are too loaded.  Oh, when the hot girl comes in, the one-legged girl has to hop away to the... 
[02:22:30]  Emma, would you mind?  Just for the radio.  Hold on.  We'll get the music for you.  Hello.  Well, when the music starts, could you just take the leg off and hop out the door?  Hop away.  Take the leg off.  Tuck it under your arm.  On one leg.  And hop away.  And could you cry and apologize?  I will not cry.  Of course not.  I thought it was mean when you took a girl's wig.  Take the leg. 
[02:23:00]  Take the leg.  Oh.  Hold on.  We're almost ready here.  Emma, you ready?  As soon as you hear the music.  Here we go.  Hold on.  Hold on here.  Can you hold it over your shoulder?  You've got great balance, I must say.  I think the CD player is drunk today, too.  Something that, I guess you build up after a while.  The balance thing.  Yeah.  Bell bottoms are a good idea.  I don't know what to say.  I'm fully comfortable.  I don't know how to make conversation. 
[02:23:30]  You're saying inappropriate things, Fez.  All right.  Here we go, Anthony.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here we go.  Here's the music.  All right.  There goes Emma.  There she goes.  She took the leg off.  Oh.  Oh.  She's hopping away.  Oh.  Oh.  There goes Emma.  That was one of the saddest things I've ever witnessed.  Did anyone do a hokey pokey joke yet?  No.  Put your left leg in.  Hey, you forgot it.  All right. 
[02:24:00]  Are we going to measure the girl?  The five feet girl?  Absolutely.  Okay.  We're going to measure her up now.  300 bucks on the line for Opie.  Big bet went on.  Opie said that if a girl says she's five feet tall, she's lying.  Because then she'd say she's 5'1", if she was five feet.  5'1", 5'2".  So he pegged her at 4'11".  Every girl that is 4'11", 4'10", rounds off to five feet.  Yeah.  So when she called and was right at Opie's limit, Opie's strict limit of five feet tall for any  girl that wants to show up tonight, you should see, he didn't want girls, Lewis, he did not 
[02:24:30]  want girls that were having their time of month to show up at this party.  Any girl that was five feet tall or under five feet couldn't come in.  Why are you talking to Lewis?  He's not even focusing at this point.  Yes, I am.  Any girls over 5'11", couldn't show up.  Why?  His rules.  They scare off the short girls.  And five feet is what?  Below five feet is too small?  Yeah.  Some girl called and said 4'11".  He said, no, midget, and hung up.  Oh, man.  And now this lovely lady called up and said that she was five feet tall. 
[02:25:00]  And Opie goes, no.  He was ready to hang up and say, you can't come.  All right.  How are we going to do this?  Lay her down.  Lay her down?  Any excuse to lay her down on the console again?  Any excuse?  If she comes in, shorthand her that other girl's leg.  We'll just attach it to the end.  All right.  Now, we've got to be careful here.  Lay straight.  It's got to be from the heel.  Oh, you're marking it? 
[02:25:30]  I don't like this way of measuring.  You don't like the measuring?  What happened to the old-fashioned way with the wall?  You may have to do her standing.  Oh, you're measuring her outside.  She's got to stand up.  Look, the best way to do this.  So she's standing flat foot.  No, she's got to stand up.  I've never seen anyone measured for height this way.  Opie, Opie, I say we mark the bottom of her heel with a Sharpie on the console.  Then we mark the top of her head and measure the distance.  No.  Why not?  Dude, she's not a cadaver.  Stand her up.  This is not how you freaking measure height. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, you're agreeing with it.  Scott's agreeing with me.  Come on.  There's no toe tag.  Wait, Lewis, help me out.  Wait, no, no.  I will not accept the way we're measuring the girl.  You are not accepting this?  When we were in grammar school and they met, you know, they met, they...  They do it against the wall.  Exactly.  This is perfect.  What we do, I think we take both measurements.  Are you saying this stretches out her vertebrae?  In my school, that's how you did it on your stomach while the man got on behind you.  We're doing it against... 
[02:26:30]  I'm not accepting the measurement.  What if it comes up 411?  I'm not going to accept the measurement.  It's unbelievable.  This is like the most scientific group of people on earth.  Exactly five feet.  No.  Exactly five feet.  No, we're not doing it that way.  How do you want to do it?  That proved that she is under five foot.  No!  No.  We're doing it against the wall.  All right, stand up against the CD.  See the wood strip?  Unbelievable.  How about against the door?  Is everyone on ecstasy here?  This is unbelievable.  What's wrong with the wood strip on the CD cabinet?  What are they passing out the drugs?  Are you guys crazy passing out the drug Crystal Method was? 
[02:27:00]  It's the goddamn drinks they've worn out.  Who'd have thought that this is where Opie would have the breakdown?  Height measurements.  300 boxes involved.  Stand up straight.  All right, hold on.  I want to make sure.  Make sure.  Let Opie mark and everything.  No.  No cheating.  She's already standing on something, a strap or something.  It's a strap from a backpack.  Oh, that'll give her another sixteenth of an inch.  Get a hold of yourself, bro.  That could be the difference. 
[02:27:30]  That could be the difference.  To make it fair, let's scrape her feet.  Could be some calluses.  Rick, now that line is way too high.  Oh, stop it.  Bezzy, help us out.  We need a level.  Yeah, we need like a ruler or something.  What is that that you have?  Wait, Stinky is pounding the door.  Oh, he wants to film this.  Oh, you want to film this.  Okay.  All right, why do you think that's too high?  That's perfect.  Make sure it's a straight level mark from the top of her head. 
[02:28:00]  What do you think?  Is that a good line right there?  Fortunately, the head's pretty flat, so we are getting a level measurement there.  Isn't she cute, Fez?  Was that unkind?  Is she cute?  I used a CD.  Eh.  I don't know if that CD's level.  Oh, Jesus.  All right, that looks...  I have a level.  All right, that looks good.  Oh, Rick has a level.  This clinches it right here.  All right.  Level it out, Rick.  Rick, it's not level that way. 
[02:28:30]  It's front to back, you idiot.  Yeah, so it's put the level front to back.  All right.  What kind of frigging...  If everyone thinks that's a fair mark, I'll accept that.  Is that a fair mark?  Well, everyone...  She's slouching.  She's not slouching.  Oh, my God.  Stand up.  Have a little dig in it.  Excuse me.  Excuse me, Rick.  I'm saying this.  You have the level, but you're doing this.  Which means it's level this way.  All right, Ant.  It's level this way.  Oh, my God. 
[02:29:00]  Now they're arguing over the line that was marked on the wall.  Make sure you're not going like this or like this.  Ant Marker.  This is some of the best radio you'll ever hear.  We are measuring a woman.  We're measuring a woman on the radio.  This is a syndicated radio show, Louis.  This is a syndicated radio show.  Cities around the country, we are measuring a woman, and we don't even know how to do it.  Louis, get over here.  There's plenty of people in the room.  Get over here.  We need your expertise.  All right.  How does he get in there? 
[02:29:30]  Great show.  It's like a rave meets this old house.  Excellent.  And we had a little Martha Stewart involved earlier, too.  Oh, my God.  You guys cheated me out of a sixteenth of an inch right there.  I'm using the level.  Louis, are you happy with that, Mark?  That's me.  I leveled it.  That's good?  All right.  Step away from the wall.  All right.  All right.  Someone hold the tape measure on the floor. 
[02:30:00]  On the floor.  Just in case he's a little off.  All right.  All right.  Make sure it's right on the floor.  And here we go.  Five.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  That didn't look good.  What happened?  What are you doing?  It's so easy.  Put it on the floor.  It's on the floor.  What's her height?  According to this, it's about 5'1". 
[02:30:30]  No.  She's not 5'1 or 2.  Remeasure.  She's not 5'1 or 5'2".  Now you're taking the old table measurements, are you?  Let's go back to the table, Matt.  It was still 5'2".  Louis, you screwed me.  I didn't have nothing to do with it.  All I did was hold the tape.  I am reduced to holding tape.  Measure her any way you want.  Any way you want.  Yeah.  No way.  She's 5'1, 5'2".  Yeah, she is.  Did you have your slippers on?  Nope.  She was barefoot. 
[02:31:00]  Barefoot.  Like they should be.  You lost it.  I don't think we were paying attention to her feet.  She might have gave, you know,  sit up on her toes a little bit.  Now let's try it the bad way,  which is just the tape measure running up her back.  This is the third time we're measuring her  in three different ways.  This is the saddest moment of my life.  Just to stand around and watch me.  Louis, we just ran out of material.  Louis, you were in a jail cell.  Stop.  This is not the saddest moment. 
[02:31:30]  Rick, no, I trust you.  She's just over 5'2".  That's the money you made from that sketch  you did on more sports, right?  Yeah.  Just went out the window.  Yep.  And no residuals.  All right.  Ah, you can own me.  Hey, Moose, Rocco.  Don't hope he find his checkbook.  That stinks.  Al Gore accepted the results better.  Come on.  He didn't put the country through this. 
[02:32:00]  How is that possible?  What am I trying to impress?  But now you're like 5'2 instead of 5'0.  She's a big girl.  See, she's getting taller.  The table, that's, come on.  Yeah, see, she's even arguing the results.  But they're all over 5'0.  No, the table was barrel.  That could have went either way.  That was 5'0.  That was 5'0.  I don't know.  You were measuring the puffiness in her heels.  Puffiness in the heels?  That usually when you...  Puffiness?  When you stand, it gets compressed a little bit.  But on the table... 
[02:32:30]  Are you canning water?  No.  Double or nothing, how much do you weigh?  115.  115.  That's a lot of can weight there, too, right?  Who doesn't know that?  Look at Norton's salivating.  That's great.  Guys like the TF?  They want to do the TF on you a lot?  Never been done.  Never been done?  Really?  Those are virgin?  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Wow.  Norton, step up.  Don't any of your boyfriends own guns?  How old are you?  A roofie's 20. 
[02:33:00]  20 years old.  You could just take a body shot and not forget about doing it all.  Body shot.  All right.  There you go.  Lewis will do my body shot.  No, you do it.  No, I don't get that.  Yeah, you take the body.  I'm actually driving the ship today.  See you again.  All right.  I hope you'll do it, but it's off of Norton's body.  We'll work it out.  You could hold a little more booze in that paunch.  I take total abuse from you for 20 minutes until I take a body shot. 
[02:33:30]  You can get out of a $300 bet for a body shot.  Unless you want $300.  Something tells me it'll cost more than $300.  Exactly.  Exactly.  To have a yam bag put back on.  You're going to make me give you $100?  Of course.  You could owe me.  Thank you.  That's how I do it always.  All right, cool.  So now you'll have to pay $100.  What a good guy.  Half of the rich is and is...  Twice as rich. 
[02:34:00]  You idiot.  All right.  Half of the rich is meeting with...  Hey, what happened to Ken?  I thought you were commenting on how I lost half my money.  Ken Spinnett?  Scott?  You having fun?  We're going to have to shut down the party in a few minutes because they've got to get  to the in-store.  Right?  You've got four of them lined up right here.  What?  Oh, more...  Flaming Dr. Peppers lined up.  Lewis, are you in?  No, I can't.  Hi, Lewis.  You said you wanted to...  Anybody?  I'll let the other people do it. 
[02:34:30]  Come on.  I'll do some more after the show.  If I have one more live read to do, it's going to sound like...  That's a fantastic snack or two.  Well, who else is doing one?  Stink wanted to.  Did Stink get to do one?  Who wanted to do one?  The police.  Nice.  Good one, Stinky.  How did Stink knock that one?  Stinky didn't do one yet?  Oh, Gary, come on.  I bet he does this awesome.  What about Jamaican Mike?  Jamaican Mike, you want to do one?  He's got a big piece of junk to take care of. 
[02:35:00]  He'll just drink it like an elephant out of a pond.  He'll just stick his junk in there and suck it up.  The man's amazing.  What a mule.  What a mule on that Jamaican.  Fram it into his rear with the trunk.  I've got to go to the phone.  Sean has something.  Sean, go ahead.  Hey, guys, keep the tape measure out and measure Devin's head.  Stop it.  Come on, Devin.  Oh, he's not in here?  Where is he?  Oh, that was funny.  There should be a pharaoh painted on the side of that head.  It's awful.  He's sculpting a beard and stuff to make it look a little smaller, though. 
[02:35:30]  It looks good.  Is that it?  Yeah, that's what they do.  Steezy Top's beard could make it look smaller.  All right, here we go.  Garrett, don't set yourself on fire.  We need you.  Oh, he's changed hands with the glass.  Wow.  All right, there they go.  More flaming Dr. Peppers.  Hey, Jamaican Mike, you're on fire.  You're on fire.  Jamaican Mike, you're on fire.  There you go.  Holy shit.  Jamaican Mike was on fire.  You didn't even know you were on fire.  Oh, my God. 
[02:36:00]  His whole left hand was on fire as he's doing the shot.  I thought we were in Mississippi in the 60s again.  All right.  Damn it, why didn't I think of that?  All right.  Exactly.  How do we explain?  We burned a black guy.  How do you explain that one to corporate?  Damn, that was funny.  How do I not think of that?  I knew I was missing something.  He's looking at his hand.  He's amazed that he was on fire.  But he finished the shot before he put it out.  He's a trooper.  Just like they do it in the crystal method. 
[02:36:30]  That's right.  Jesus Christ.  I love putting Lewis in these situations.  I love it.  It's just more delusional by the minute.  Stinky cleaning up now after his shot.  Yeah.  You've done those before, right, Garrett?  No?  What do you think?  It was great.  Really good.  Especially where the beer fizz is when you throw a bit in there. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah.  Get him nice and loose for later.  He'll be tussling.  He'll be asleep.  Tussle, tussle, pump, pump.  Give him a little tussle and a pump.  Hey, Tony's got something in Philly.  Yes, Tony?  Yo, Opie.  Hey, what's up, Tony?  Double or nothing.  You've got to guess your age.  Oh, jeez.  I would love to do that, but you already said the age.  Yeah.  I don't want to cheat.  Oh, imagine that taint.  Because it is a talent I have.  Still got the wrapper on it, I bet.  I don't need to cheat with the taint test. 
[02:37:30]  By the way, that WNBA stalker bit was pretty funny.  Oh, thank you, Tony.  You guys kill C.  It's too bad no one's going to see it tonight because they preempted.  We were promoting it all day, and it turned out they threw it on ESPN at 5 o'clock today.  I think they're rerunning that particular show on Friday night.  I don't get it.  Jay's show is really funny, and they move it around all the time.  It's never on at the same time.  It's called marketing.  Is that it?  Yeah, it's called marketing.  When you've got a good show, you can't leave it in one place for people to know where it is and where to find it. 
[02:38:00]  Why don't you try now?  Tell me.  Yeah, it's a fine event.  It's eight different shifts.  You got some racket, though, on this station here in New York.  They're doing middays, and then they'll do nights.  There's no midday show in New York.  No, no midday show.  So whenever they want to maybe stay out late, they do the midday show.  They decide what show they want to do on any particular day.  It's working out very nice for us.  They do two shows here on WNEW, and some days it's midday. 
[02:38:30]  Some days they do the night show and then rerun the show in the other day.  Whatever it takes, right?  Team player.  Exactly.  We're here for you if it fits our schedule.  Let's check in with Foz, our pal from Cleveland.  Foz, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  I'm sitting in the studio with Kim Monroe, the PD here, who wanted to congratulate you.  Oh.  We haven't talked to Kim on the air yet.  No, you haven't.  As the PD, is she loving this show today or hating it?  I'm loving it.  Oh, cool, Kim. 
[02:39:00]  Are you kidding?  I love the Crystal Method, and I'm all for the flaming Dr. Peppers.  Bring them on.  Yeah.  Bring it on.  You've got to come down and party with us.  Love to.  Actually, Crystal Method's going to be here on Wednesday.  Kim, how are you doing?  This is Scott from the Crystal Method.  Hey, Scott.  What's going on?  I know we owe you a few Dr. Peppers, so we'll get them to you this Wednesday.  Yeah.  The last time I had Dr. Peppers with you was in Seattle, my going away party.  I guess you're going to...  Oh, yes.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  And they told us to shut them down.  The guy from the hotel came out to the outside bar and said, oh, you cannot do that. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, I know.  We lit the last few of them on an order.  Hey, tell Ken, too.  I still owe him big for saving my life that night.  Oh, my...  Oh, this is a good story.  This is a good story.  Well, what is Ken's save my life?  Kim, do you want to tell...  Do you want this story to go out on the air?  Who do you want to talk to?  Well, I just can't say who it was.  I don't want to embarrass the person.  But let's just say a musician from a former band.  Well, they're not together anymore, but the band goes on and on and on.  If Ken's lit up in that room, he'll go right into the store, whether or not you want to  put it on the air or not.  I don't want to say who it was. 
[02:40:00]  No, Ken, don't say who it was.  Don't say who it was.  Don't say who it was.  Ken helped hide me away from this person who was rather drunk and kind of, would you  say, stalking me that night, Ken?  Oh.  A little bit stalking you.  Sounds mysterious.  Big, tall guy.  Well, tell everybody off the air.  He's a big, tall guy.  Yeah.  Tell everybody off the air.  Ken, you can tell them off the air.  Okay.  And then we'll tell everybody off the air.  Yeah, of course you will.  Look, Tim knows us.  So, Crystal Method's playing Nautica and Cleveland on July 31st. 
[02:40:30]  Yep.  Right on.  That's right.  So, we're looking forward to having him here.  Thank you, Kim.  And we've got to get you guys in here.  Yeah, we're working on some things, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yes, we are.  We've got a couple ideas, and we've got to get to Cleveland.  Cleveland gave us huge ratings yesterday.  That's the theme today, is you'll be right there.  And it shows like today that give us great ratings.  That's it.  Kim is awesome.  Kim went from Seattle to Cleveland and turned that station around.  Isn't that right, Kim?  That's right.  That's my job.  Plus, without me and Anthony, what can I say? 
[02:41:00]  All right.  Awesome.  Well, thank you, Kim.  Thanks, and congratulations, you guys.  You did us very proud.  Yes, we did.  Thank you.  We'll return the favor by getting a lot of people arrested in Cleveland in the very near future.  That's what I'm talking about.  All right.  Cool.  Thank you, Kim.  Thanks, guys.  There she goes.  Kim Monroe.  What does she look like?  She's cute.  She's cute.  Great hair.  She's cute.  Yeah.  Cool.  Cute, young, in shape.  Nice.  Who was the guy? 
[02:41:30]  Who was the guy?  Are we still in the air?  No.  That guy.  Put that on the air or something.  Who was the guy?  Come on now.  I'm not saying anything.  Remember that one time on the MTV Music Awards when the bass player from a band that  from a band threw the bass up there and it came down and hit him in the second hand?  Oh, right, right.  I remember that.  Sure.  Yeah.  All right.  It wasn't Geezer Butler, was it?  No.  Yeah.  No, no.  A bass player.  He's sure Geezer's some bass player, right? 
[02:42:00]  Hey, Ben's freaking out.  We've got to get these guys out of here?  All right.  We've got to get Crystal Method out of here.  Thank you very much for having us.  We've got to thank Ken and Scott for being a house band today.  This is the most fun we've ever had on the radio.  Lewis is hanging.  He's getting us through the rest of this mess.  But Crystal Method, they've got to go.  They've got a CD out today.  Community service.  There's a remix of Boom from P.O.D. on it and a lot of other things.  They're like, whatever, dude.  No, I mean, we're proud of the house.  I was leaving and I had to pick up, because I always bring some ACDC on the road. 
[02:42:30]  But I had to bring Back in Black for some reason.  Did not know that Lewis was going to be here.  His theme song.  Thank you very much, Lewis.  You're awesome.  Lewis Black fans.  Would you like him to sign it?  Have him sign the album cover, man.  That would be cool.  Yeah.  Why not totally go on and totally remove the value from it.  Where can the fans go to see The Crystal Method?  I don't know.  You don't know?  No.  It's the Virgin Megastore in Union Square tonight at 7.30.  And they're playing Friday at Central Fly in New York City, okay? 
[02:43:00]  Cool, man.  And their tour dates will be up on foundrymusic.com.  They're hitting a lot of the cities that we broadcast in.  So check out Crystal Method when they come to your city.  Guys, thank you.  This was a great, great time.  The most fun we've ever had at a radio station.  The most Flaming Dr. Peppers we've ever had at a radio station.  Because this is illegal to do at radio stations.  And we didn't even talk about anything.  No, not that.  We talked about Flaming Dr. Peppers.  We hung out and goofed on stuff.  It's pretty much it. 
[02:43:30]  All right, cool.  Thanks, guys.  Thank you.  We're going to break, and I hope we have a little show left.  Sure.  Good evening, ignorant pigs.  Put down your crack pipes and your beer balls, and pay attention.  Well, I'm a virgin.  Party! 
[02:44:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show.  A four-hour parade of meat.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony rock.  Nice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  How about that, huh?  Oh, on YSP.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Only a few minutes left.  And then Ron and Fez.  Next in New York City. 
[02:44:30]  It'll be a bad stop.  We're not going to try to follow this.  Get a tape.  They already did one live show today, so they do a tape show after the O&A show here in  New York.  Ben just walked out, Ken and Scott, from Crystal Method.  It was pretty funny.  They had one of, you know, first of all, Patrick, their tour guy.  Yeah.  Did you notice him?  Like, dude, can you keep them away from the hard alcohol for a little while?  Their other hand, one of the girls, she's like, oh, at least you guys can walk, all right.  You're not that drunk.  At one point, Scott came up to me, and he had the bottle of Cabo. 
[02:45:00]  Yeah.  And he goes, could you just hide this?  He goes, Ken really likes this stuff, and if he starts on this, he's not going to make  it to the in-store.  Cool.  Well, that was a lot of fun.  Man, hell yeah.  I think they're going to come back one day this week.  I'm sure they will.  Oh, hell yeah.  Before the Central Fly Show.  We just kind of hit it off with those guys.  I don't know.  We met him in Boston at that Halloween thing, and we've been friends ever since. 
[02:45:30]  Well, could you imagine, you know, we have a good time and all here, but could you imagine  going to another station with the schleppy, stupid interview after this?  You mean an organized radio show?  Yeah.  God forbid.  There is that thought.  Where they measure, well, there they measure bass.  Right.  Where they actually treat you nice and get all your plugs in.  I couldn't imagine, though, after this, the girls spinning, hanging, drinking, the debauchery  going in, and like, so when did you start spinning? 
[02:46:00]  Shut up.  Bring on the booze.  There you have it.  Let's play what we learned real fast, because there's a few good ones.  Young engineer from Philly, writes Anthony.  Today, I learned Pete Johnson is my idol, and today, if I keep on dancing, I'll eventually  reach his incredible stature in broadcasting.  That's pretty good.  Pete from Vegas.  Today, I learned that 151 does not get the stink off the stump.  I'd love to find something that takes it out of my mouth.  That's the new slogan. 
[02:46:30]  Oh, God.  Thank God for Norton.  Daniel from Alabama.  I learned today that Chris Novoselic was stalking some girl in Cleveland.  Yeah, right.  What a secret.  Allegedly.  Todd from Buffalo.  I learned dancing keeps the kids out of trouble, and the Pope's wife, Sharon, keeps  propping him up on stage.  Sheep lover.  I learned today rubber socks make your stump stink.  Mitchell from Cleveland.  I learned today that you can burn a black man on the air and not get in trouble. 
[02:47:00]  You all right there, Jamaican Mike?  Yeah, I'm good.  Your whole freaking hand was on fire.  That wasn't a little fire you had going.  That baby was burning, you know?  I was like, whoa.  Good thing it wasn't your mule.  We would have had to fly a plane in to dump water on us.  Later, we'll do lynch shots.  What?  White people are...  Get a pickup truck.  Tie his feet.  We're doing shots.  Oh, see.  All right, Greasy.  What a doody. 
[02:47:30]  What a funny joke, yeah.  The Greasy man appreciates humor laying that vein in.  Hey, Joe, what's going on?  No matter how bad, hotness takes away smelliness.  That is so true.  Yeah, there you go.  You'll deal with a lot if the girl's hot.  All right, thank you, bro.  We got to get some plugs in before we get the hell out of here.  Go ahead, Ben.  SMVisuals.com.  SMVisuals.com and Guitar Center in Paramus.  Okay.  And that's it?  I have to give out a phone number, but I'll wait until you're done.  You can do that. 
[02:48:00]  Lewis Black has a plug.  He's got a new CD out called The End of the Universe.  You can go to LewisBlack.net to check it out.  It's going to be a great CD like the last one.  I hope so.  And you're going to be in the Poconos.  I'm going to be in September.  That's how the career rolls.  We learned that too.  That's the series.  Caesar's Picnic Cut.  Schnackies.  Go ahead, Jim.  Jim.  732-842-9000 for Red Bay.  I had to do that because my Ticketmaster link was wrong, so half the people that want to  get tickets can't get them.  Always a problem.  Dude, technology stinks. 
[02:48:30]  And guys, we started a new trend today.  Stump shots.  Stump shots.  Who knew?  It's here for Crystal Method to party with us today, and I hope it sounded like something.  We'll do it again tomorrow, okay? </pre>
