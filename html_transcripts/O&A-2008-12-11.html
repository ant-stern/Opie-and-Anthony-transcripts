<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion about a video of a robot girl undergoing tests, sparking a conversation about humanity's inherent tendency to use new technologies for sex, ranging from the printing press to cell phones. This transitioned into news stories about underage girls involved in prostitution and a sex party.  Sheriff Warren Evans, a studio guest, was interviewed, repeatedly highlighting the involvement of 16-year-old girls, eliciting amusement from the hosts.  The conversation then briefly touched upon Russell Brand's planned remake of "Arthur."

Opie detailed his recent hair transplant, describing the process and its awkward current state.  The hosts reacted to the news that President Obama would be sworn in using his full middle name, "Hussein," leading to a discussion about the name's connotations post-9/11. This segued into a crude quiz about teenage sexual activity, focusing on a news report about rising rates of anal sex among teens and the associated health risks.  Opie then shared stories of an armed robbery at a McDonald's and a confrontation with an aggressive stranger outside a convenience store, launching a discussion on self-defense and the justification of deadly force.  They discussed online crime videos, including convenience store robberies and an ATM killing.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a Michigan teacher accused of having sex with a student, and speculation on the leniency given to attractive versus unattractive teachers in such cases.

The show continued with a discussion of Joe the Plumber's book, "Fighting the American Dream," followed by a news story about an 18-year-old who accidentally texted her father about losing her virginity.  The hosts debated the story's authenticity and analyzed the text messages, with Jim Norton expressing skepticism.  The conversation shifted to Jennifer Aniston's GQ photoshoot, involving graphic descriptions of aging women's strategies for maintaining their appearance.  This led to further discussions about sex, teenage sexting, and the legal implications of distributing nude photos of minors. Dr. Georgia Whittakin, a psychiatry professor, called in, but her perspective was dismissed by the hosts.  The segment included more listener calls detailing teenage sexual experiences, including stories about school sexting investigations, a girl using sexting to taunt an ex, and "rainbow parties."  A humorous anecdote about a bear attack and discussions of Jim Norton's severe cystic acne and his upcoming Viper Room appearance were also included.

The next segment started with a discussion about a website's ranking of the worst guitar solos ever, featuring artists like Lenny Kravitz, Nirvana, Oasis, and Twisted Sister.  Danny, a staff member, participated in the debate.  Rob Bartlett was mentioned as an upcoming guest, with promotion of his comedy shows.  The conversation shifted to a nine-year-old author, Alec Grevin, who wrote a book on how to talk to girls.  The hosts discussed the absurdity of this, using crude and sexually suggestive language.  They then discussed childhood experiences, including "cooties" and childhood sexual exploration.  This segued into a discussion of violent online videos, including taser videos and convenience store robberies, with graphic descriptions and a discussion of their differing reactions to violence against Americans versus others.  A documentary about a Palestinian suicide bomber and the mothers of both the bomber and her victim was mentioned. "Stunt Brain" provided a report on potential changes at their radio station.  The hosts then engaged in a rambling discussion about global warming, proposing a theory about an inaccurate Earth calendar.  This included listener calls and speculation about historical calendar adjustments and a listener suggesting the Earth's axis shift theory.  The segment concluded with a discussion of a UFC fight featuring broken bones, including graphic descriptions and audio of Joe Rogan's commentary, and a comparison of backyard wrestling to MMA, with graphic descriptions of a leg break shown in a video clip.


The show continued with a discussion of a UFC fight featuring Corey Hill's horrific leg break, shown in slow motion.  This abruptly shifted to a PajamaGram commercial, followed by a graphic discussion of a Penthouse Pet magazine.  Comedian Rob Bartlett joined the show and participated in this discussion.  Bartlett then recounted a near-fatal pulmonary embolism, detailing his collapse, emergency room visit, and treatment, including jokes about the effects of blood thinners on sexual function.  The conversation turned to the medical profession, with crude jokes about proctologists and gynecologists. Dr. Steve, a listener, called in, further detailing medical procedures and confirming spontaneous orgasms during prostate exams.  They discussed the history of medical practices, specifically urine tasting for diabetes diagnosis.  Dr. Steve was thanked for a Christmas gift, and the hosts discussed Rob Bartlett's upcoming shows and potential film appearance, Rob's recovery, and speculation about the "secret document guy" controlling the country.  The show concluded with more off-color jokes and mentions of Rob Bartlett's and Dr. Steve's upcoming engagements.

The final segment focused on Barack Obama's upcoming presidency and his planned speech in a Muslim city.  The hosts speculated on potential reactions, comparing it to a similar action by George W. Bush.  They discussed perceived differences between Republican and Democrat foreign policy approaches, expressing cynicism but acknowledging Obama's intelligence and hoping for a positive outcome.  They also touched on the loss of US clout during the Bush administration.  The segment concluded with a brief advertisement for Rob Bartlett's upcoming shows at Gotham Comedy Club and a Long Island venue.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah, good morning.  Morning to ya.  Ah!  Top of the morning to ya.  What's up, Anthony?  Oh, not much.  Thru's day.  It's raining here in New York. 
[00:00:30]  I was just watching Robot Girl on Drudge, I guess, right?  DrudgeReport.com?  Yeah.  Some dude is claiming he's got the perfect wife.  Freep.  And they were going through some kind of testing thing.  And then the camera pans back, and it's Robot Girl head on kind of like a chair.  Yeah.  I thought it was a whole body.  No, I... 
[00:01:00]  Is it...  Because I saw hands.  Well, not when...  The video I was watching, it was just a head.  And it was...  And the scientist, or whatever you want to call him, was having her go through some exercises.  And I was telling Anthony, one of the exercises was process this color.  Yeah.  I'm like, if you want the average Joe to get into this, you don't say process color, you  just say, what's the color?  Yeah, what color is that?  Because it's a robot. 
[00:01:30]  It's a computer.  Yes!  So you can say some just inane babble and make it, you know, make it be that you want her  to tell you what color something is.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  That guy, all those guys are like really creepy.  The guys that build these robots, because the thing's mouth doesn't move right.  And then he said, and everybody, the first thing you think of is, all right, can you F it?  Yeah. 
[00:02:00]  Of course.  You know, and he's like, well, I could have it reprogrammed to have an orgasm or something  like that.  No, that's the only reason they're building these things.  Oh, stop.  I read an article about technology, and every time there's a new technology that hits, you  know, human beings, the first thing they use it for is sex.  Yeah.  The printing press, going way back when they first invented that, it was all about writing  little stories, little sex stories to everybody. 
[00:02:30]  And then after a while, you go, okay, what else could this thing do?  Fax machines?  Yeah.  You know, you're faxing body parts all over the place.  It was faxing dirty, funny little things to hang up in your cubicle.  That too, sure.  Before that became inappropriate.  Right.  Computers?  I mean, we're still doing it for sex.  Yeah.  That one we're not out of yet.  And now we're learning about the teenagers out there, you know, texting their dirty pictures  to their friends and, you know, potential boyfriends or girlfriends. 
[00:03:00]  I mean, that is like, that is rampant.  It is.  In the schools right now.  What do they call it?  Sexting?  Sexting.  They text these pictures.  I haven't seen them.  I never get to see them online or anything like that.  Yeah, because every article says, well, not only do they, you know, text these filthy  pictures to each other, they end up online.  And, of course, being a middle-aged guy, you've got to think right away, well, where online? 
[00:03:30]  Where?  Shouldn't there be these sites that are like, you know, sextingpictures.com?  What if you go there?  Turn on that monitor over there so I can see what Danny's always fiddling with.  Danny's always a bevy of entertainment that he's got to have his monitor where he can look  at it and where the room can look at it.  Yeah.  Because you never know what filth Danny's going to pull up on his computer.  I notice every once in a while he has an oopsie. 
[00:04:00]  Yeah.  Some kind of oopsie.  What do you mean an oopsie?  You know.  Maybe stuff you would look at by yourself in your room late at night.  Oh, that's not true.  Not in front of all your friends.  Oh, but I hit the wrong button on the screen and you can see his screen?  Yeah, there's some oopsies that pop up every once in a while.  Oopsies.  I'm well aware that everyone can see these screens.  I'll just call it an oopsie.  Use your imagination at home.  So the sexting is a biggie.  And all the networks are doing stories on this yesterday.  I think we got a couple clips from one of the networks doing the sexting thing. 
[00:04:30]  We didn't have this when we were in school now.  Of course not.  You couldn't even.  There was nothing.  What are you going to do?  Taking a Polaroid swinger camera?  We actually had to sit there and learn.  Yeah.  We had no choice.  We had to sit there and learn.  We didn't have cell phones in the classroom.  Pass a note.  You know, if you wanted to cheat, you had to make these.  If you like me, check yes.  Right, right.  No. 
[00:05:00]  You get nothing back.  What were those things with the.  Oh, okay.  Pick a number.  Three.  One, two, three.  Pick a color.  Blue.  B-L-U-E.  All right.  I'll lift the little tab up.  Yep.  I hate you.  Yeah.  That's all we had.  And I was going to say, when you wanted to cheat, you got cheat sheets.  Remember the tiny little cheat sheets?  You try to make them as big as maybe your thumb and hide it on your thumb.  Yeah.  Or you would like put cheat sheets in the bathroom. 
[00:05:30]  And then, of course, you'd go in the middle of the test.  Oh, I got to go to the bathroom.  And conveniently, you got some fine little, some little notes in the stall.  I always heard about people that cheated on tests.  I.  It was.  Never did, because never took them.  I had fun cheating at times.  It was like a sport.  Yeah, it did seem like a fun thing, but.  And now they're texting and cheating.  But I guess the schools are finally on to that.  They're cracking down on it. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, but they.  It's not hard, though.  But they would break out their phones and get the answer to tests.  Or text each other the answer.  And these kids in these schools, they know how to text without looking at the keyboard.  That's the difference between us and the kids in school.  They know how to text without looking.  We never had to master that.  And the reason they had to master that is because they're texting.  They have their hand in their pocket, and they're texting as they're listening to a dullard up at the front of the classroom. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then it vibrates, and they know, okay, I got to text back.  And I guess they take a quick peek, and then they back in their pocket, and they're texting without looking.  But where are the nudie pictures?  You want to get into that?  It's like, oh, they, you know, they found nudie pictures, and they put them up online, and they did the.  All right, what's that?  That's not a girl in high school.  That's a girl making believe she's in high school.  Pretty good, though.  It's still pretty sweet.  Is this a sexting site there, Danny?  No, this is a, I mean, I don't know how underground it is, because anybody could find these sites. 
[00:07:00]  But it's basically just like anonymous image hosting, and a lot of these cell phone pictures and stuff of these chicks usually will make its way here sooner or later.  Boy, it didn't take long for you to find this, Danny.  Of course it's not.  That's not an easy URL to remember, by the way.  Danny's the Magellan of the internet.  Yeah, they say I'm a man who knows how to get things.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, if it was, if it was.  All red.  If it was teensexting.com, I'd go, all right, he was lucky.  But look at this URL. 
[00:07:30]  There's like dashes and underscores.  Oh, yeah.  Danny's the rain man of the internet, I swear to you.  Yeah.  Well, here we go.  It's like, Danny, find this.  Boom, he's found it.  How about a link to your pals?  Not a problem.  Why don't we check this out?  Cell phones transmitting child pornography.  Yes, more.  See, this is the news trying to sex it up.  Sex it up.  This is the news just trying to get a little more dramatic. 
[00:08:00]  It's teenage girls.  It's teenage boys.  Technically, I guess it would be child porn.  But in their world, they're not thinking they're trading child porn.  Before you even get to the story, the news people are despicable.  Because last night I saw a story about this prostitution ring.  These guys would go over to this house, and there'd be prostitutes over there.  And this woman that was also a mother was running this apartment with this sex ring in it. 
[00:08:30]  And apparently she had a couple of 16-year-olds dancing in this.  Why, we got that story, too?  Yeah, we'll do that.  But the way the guy was talking to another gentleman about the story, all he would bring up was the 16-year-old.  Because the other one was like, yes, and there was prostitution going on and this.  And the guy would be like, but the 16-year-olds, were they available for prostitution or just dancing? 
[00:09:00]  Well, as far as we know now, they were partially clad and dancing.  But the prostitution that was going on there, some people were arrested.  The mother was arrested.  It's despicable that the mother of these 16-year-olds that were semi-nude dancing,  he could not get enough of just talking about these nude, semi-nude 16-year-olds.  Because that keeps people doing it.  Well, of course, I wasn't going anywhere. 
[00:09:30]  Whether you think it's hot, whether you think it's despicable,  you're going to keep watching the story because of that.  Yeah.  It worked on you, Ant?  The strategy worked?  Oh, it worked perfectly.  The remote, I threw the remote out the window just in case I accidentally hit it.  You ever do that?  You sit on the remote right in the middle of a really important part of a movie or live show?  No!  Or mess up your DVR by changing the channel by accident, forgetting that you're on DVR?  My favorite is a lot of times I'll leave the remote up on top of the blankie. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And then you go to pull the blanket up to your shoulders because it gets a little chilly  and you launch the remote about 10 feet across the room and hear it smash on the floor.  I'm like, son of a bitch, now I've got to get out of bed.  I'm too drunk to get out of bed and get it now.  It's cold out there and two in the morning you're fumbling with eye crusties trying to put batteries in the right way.  And one battery rolled under the dresser and it's just a mess. 
[00:10:30]  Not fun.  Here's the hooker story and then we'll do the sexting.  Hooker!  I thought I was doing very well with you.  Russell Brand remaking Arthur.  Look, we're all over the place now.  Yeah, he's writing some kind of remake to Arthur.  What black guy is playing Arthur?  No kidding.  Well, you know who Russell Brand is, though, right?  The white dude?  I didn't do that.  Yeah, but it just sounds like something where they take a black guy and make Arthur.  You think?  All hip and yo and, you know, gangster. 
[00:11:00]  They're redoing it.  Another great comedy.  They can't leave alone.  He'll get won an Oscar for that.  Yeah.  Leave it alone.  You're not getting it better.  Leave it alone.  What are you going to do?  I mean, it's a long way from actually making it on the screen for us to watch, but it was in the paper yesterday that he's attempting to rewrite that or remake that or whatever.  All right, here we go.  Hooker.  Hooker mom had daughter dancing at sex party.  Some house party we have here with its host supposedly offering sex for cash.  Just the beginning.  Detroit cops busted in on 19 suspected prostitutes and their accused Johns. 
[00:11:30]  But here's what gets me.  Police say two teenage girls were at this party dancing half naked on stage.  They're 16-year-olds.  Even worse than that, one of their moms is accused of being the host.  Here she is, some role model, huh?  She's one of four under arrest.  Get more details on this.  Joining us, Sheriff Warren Evans from Wayne County Sheriff's Office.  As clean as you can.  I mean, what kind of scene?  As clean as you can.  I think this is the guy I was watching. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  I hope so.  He can't get enough of the 16, just bringing up the 16-year-old.  One so far.  Yeah, yeah.  As clean as you can.  And please talk very slowly.  Yes.  I mean, what kind of scene?  It sounds horrible, especially for 16-year-olds.  It sounds horrible.  Especially for 16-year-olds.  That's his second 16-year-old reference.  It has to stay in the news voice, too.  It sounds horrible.  It sounds horrible.  As clean as language as you can, but, you know, filthy it up as much as you can.  Yeah, you know. 
[00:12:30]  Walk the line for us.  Yeah, please.  We need ratings.  As clean as you can.  I mean, what kind of scene?  It sounds horrible, especially for 16-year-olds.  Yeah, well, so much for the fundamental responsibility of mothers protecting their children, for sure.  About 19 prostitutes in the house, about 20 other Johns, the two underage girls, an armed  doorman, plenty of ecstasy and marijuana and other drugs being sold, and a number of firearms  confiscated.  Oh, I'll see.  Is that where it cuts off? 
[00:13:00]  No, we got another clip, hopefully.  Oh, because right after that, I think he went like, yes, but the 16-year-olds.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  The 16-year-olds.  That was it.  This is the guy I saw.  I was just like, I was watching this laughing, going, this guy cannot get enough of these  16-year-olds.  He ought to keep bringing them up.  Nice.  The 16-year-olds, we forget, were they were dancing half naked?  Were they selling themselves for money?  Were they prostituting themselves?  My sense is that was part of it, but it wasn't part of the actual raid here, so I can't speak 
[00:13:30]  to it in this particular situation.  But clearly, they were dancing for money, nude and semi-nude.  Oh, so what's going to happen to this guy?  Did you hear that?  He actually went, oh.  He made, that was a groan of pleasure.  That was a groan of pleasure.  Oh, I made that groan at the computer a few times.  What is that?  Listen to the sound he made. 
[00:14:00]  Semi-nude.  Oh, so what's going to happen?  Oh, he actually got caught going, oh, oh, yeah, I'm on the news.  Oh, so what's going to happen to this daughter and the other 16-year-old as well?  What happened to her?  Well, they're in shelters right now, so we'll have to look and see what the...  What's going to happen with this daughter?  Actually, he probably meant to say, what's going to happen to this mother?  It sounded awkward, because he knew there were two 16-year-olds.  Yeah.  So listen to the way he says that. 
[00:14:30]  He means to say, what's going to happen to this mother?  But he's so fixated on these girls that he had to say that, and then he goes, and the other one to make up for it.  Believe me, I watched this.  He was fixated on this.  So what's going to happen to this daughter and the other 16-year-old as well?  What happened to her?  Well, they're in shelters right now.  We'll have to look and see what the placement is.  Both kids have had extensive truancy problems in the past, along with petty crimes and delinquent acts in the juvenile court. 
[00:15:00]  So they're not new to confusion in their lives.  So we're just going to see what we can do to turn them around.  But that's never an easy task.  No, it's turn them around.  It's such a sad thing when you think 16-year-olds.  Dude, dude.  I was roaring at this point.  I'm like, how many more times is he going to say 16-year-olds?  I like the idea of trying to turn them around.  Yeah, right?  I don't think that's what he meant, but he could give it the old college try, though, right? 
[00:15:30]  He loves 16-year-olds.  You think?  There's 19-year-olds, and you take away three years, and that made that we get it.  Yeah, we know.  16, all right.  16 is the lucky number for that guy.  I'm so happy I had those clips, because I was watching that last night.  Yeah, we got it.  And going, what the hell is wrong with this guy?  He loves 16-year-olds.  All right, we're going to take a quick break.  We were starting the show by talking about the sexting, though.  Yeah.  This is happening in the schools.  Are 16-year-olds doing this?  Yes.  Oh! 
[00:16:00]  Oh!  Yes!  Oh!  They sure are.  And then you got a teenager losing her virginity, okay, on a class trip, and she accidentally texted  someone about it.  Oops.  We'll tell you who after the break, Opie and Anthony.  Good morning.  Opie and Anthony.  Looking at some of the things that people will be talking about today, Anthony. 
[00:16:30]  First of all, not many people participated in the gay without a gay thing.  That was yesterday.  I noticed, God, I could not get a freshly cut flower arrangement.  It looks good at all.  Thank God I didn't have to get curtains put up.  Things like that.  And you're waiting on the haircut.  Yeah, wow.  Until the hair plugs grow in.  They're not plugs. 
[00:17:00]  I saw somebody had something up there, but they went away.  Somebody else had the same procedure.  They're follicles.  John from John and K Plus 8 had the exact same procedure as you.  Did he?  I thought people were sick of the John and K thing, so I just blew off a phone call.  No, I'm waiting for them to sprout in a little better, you know, because it looks like I got a mighty fine crew cut on the back of my head.  And you can scrub away now? 
[00:17:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's weird.  I shampoo like a madman now.  And they said that's fine?  Oh, yeah.  Nothing's going to fall out?  No, they're all in there now.  They're all part of, it's part of my head.  Those individual hair plugs won't fall out?  They're follicles.  They're not plugs.  Plugs are big groups of hairs that were all knotty and nasty and stuff.  It's the new technology.  It's one hair at a time, one follicle placed in there.  Bam, bam, bam, bam.  They stick your head thousands of times. 
[00:18:00]  Then they pop these one at a time in there.  You're going to do the big reveal after the holidays, right?  No, it's not even long enough.  No, I want to see it again.  I saw it two or three days in, and now I don't want to see it until after the holidays and see where you're at.  I'm talking like six months at least before I have any real significant, you know, where you can, wow, look at that.  Look at his long locks.  Now it's like this big monk-like bald patch in the back because they shaved, you know, the hair I had there, the wispy kind of hair, 
[00:18:30]  shaved all that off to put in the follicles, and now it just looks silly.  You look ridiculous.  Now it just looks silly.  Without the hat?  Yeah, because the sides are kind of long, because I haven't gotten it cut because I don't want to go get my hair cut because it just looks silly.  Just shave the whole thing down to the same size.  No, then I'm afraid the rest that is there ain't going to grow back.  They don't grow back.  No, I'm very frightened.  No, that's if you go all the way down the skin, you might have a problem.  No, I'm very scared. 
[00:19:00]  All right.  So also, it's being reported today that Obama is going to be sworn in as Barack Hussein Obama.  That's right.  It's he's saying that this has just been the tradition of the inauguration.  They use the president-elect's full name during the swearing in.  Uh-huh.  John Fitzgerald Kennedy. 
[00:19:30]  They've they've they've always done that.  Um, but who who the hell would have thought, especially post 9-11, mind you, that we would be swearing in a president with the name Hussein in there?  It's just I was reading that last night and without any, you know, not even not even without my normal, you know, son of a bitch.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe this is happening. 
[00:20:00]  Yeah.  Uh, rationale or irrational, whatever you want to call it.  I really thought about it and thought, wow, you know something?  We're not even 10 years out from 9-11 where obviously radical Muslims flew planes into our buildings.  Uh, where Saddam Hussein, Hussein, um, was, uh, running amok and, uh, you know, everybody seemed to have the name Hussein that somewhere in their name that was a Muslim extremist or terrorist. 
[00:20:30]  And now our president.  A mere seven plus years later.  Yeah.  Is being sworn in as Barack Hussein Obama.  Yeah.  It, it, it's beyond me how quickly it just shows you we can, you know, is it healing or just we don't give a crap?  Well, Obama cared because during the campaign he made sure no one used his middle name.  No, of course, because that was, uh, that was a biggie.  And, and anyone who did use his middle name, they, uh, said was, you know, trying to do some Islamic thing to him. 
[00:21:00]  Some harm.  They were trying to tie him in.  Exactly.  You know, Hussein for, uh, you know, the better part of, of the last almost 20 years, the name Hussein has not been very popular in, uh, in this country.  I guess we could bring back the, uh, the Hitler name finally.  Hitler should absolutely make a comeback.  I think our next Hitler.  Hitler or the name. 
[00:21:30]  Our next, uh, Hitler.  Our next president should have, uh, Hitler at least as the middle name.  And people are like, that's crazy.  Is it?  How much?  Hussein.  How much crazier is it?  Come on.  So you got that going on.  Obama to be sworn in.  I want someone with the middle name Milosevic.  He was a real cheery guy.  He woke up on the wrong side of bed a few times, huh?  Yes, he certainly did.  Wow.  Uh, so you got that going on.  And more and more teens are having, uh, having what? 
[00:22:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well, you know, we started.  Humming contests?  We started the, uh, we started the Anthony quiz thing yesterday.  Why don't you guess?  More and more teens are having, huh, these days.  Uh, sex.  Uh, well, that is a given.  That's the obvious.  What kind, my friend?  I would say, uh, sex of the variety where you can't have a discussion during, uh, during  it.  Nope.  No?  Wait a minute.  Sex where you can't have a discussion because, uh, someone's face is in the pillow? 
[00:22:30]  Yup.  Wow.  Naughty, naughty.  16?  Probably 16, eh?  That's probably the going age for the teenager.  Are you kidding?  Having this type of sex, I would imagine.  They're doing that.  Is it because they're saving, uh, the other one for marriage?  Who was the lucky devil that had to do the research for this story?  You know.  I mean, these stories just don't come out of nowhere.  Dude, how off limits was that?  How off limits was that in high school? 
[00:23:00]  Forget about it.  That wasn't even, like, in the discussion.  Here you are.  Um.  I'm worried laughing.  Hey, do you think, um, oh, God.  Whew, this is so good.  God, you're, you're f***ing fantastic.  Do you think I could f*** you in the f***?  Ow!  Ow!  Ryan, you could have just said no. 
[00:23:30]  When we were growing up, if we suggested that, the girl would think you were a serial killer.  Of course, and then you'd have to be.  Yeah, right.  They wouldn't even think twice.  They would think you were some animal.  They were pinned to the mat.  Well, you want me to.  There's no way they were.  You would turn them over.  Yeah.  You want me to read this, uh, story nice and slow?  Please.  All right, Ed.  All right.  Um, can we say that word or probably not, huh?  I don't think so.  We all know what we're talking about, right? 
[00:24:00]  All right.  How about every time I point to you, you could beep or something?  Study reports.  Study reports.  Study reports.  That, um, f***ing sex.  On rise among teens.  That's right.  A Colorado, Carrie, a Colorado student who has been in a steady relationship for months.  Can't sit down?  Is that part of the story?  Was recently cajoled.  Cajoled?  C-A-J-O-L-E-D.  And he cajoled by her boyfriend into some sexual experimentation. 
[00:24:30]  Into speaking Greek?  He wanted to try...  F***ing sex.  And even though the 20-year-old said she was okay with the idea, she nervously downed several  drinks before their lovemaking began.  Good egg.  That's what you got to do, man.  That's what I did the first time I had to.  Give me a Seagram 7 and a prune juice.  What a good egg.  Give me a concoction called the gaper.  I guess she's heard the stories. 
[00:25:00]  It's just a mystery.  Just something to, you know, loosen yourself up with figuratively and literally.  Within 15 seconds, Carrie, not her real name, said she was crying and asking him to stop.  Come on.  You killjoy, you can't stop at that point.  That's where, as a guy, you just got to go,  You have to whisper, where's your stick-to-itiveness?  Yeah, come on. 
[00:25:30]  They never did it again, but experts say that as social morales ease, more young heterosexuals  are engaging in...  F***ing sex.  A behavior once rarely mentioned in polite circles.  Yeah.  Or impolite, whatever circles.  In polite...  In?  New word, polite circles.  Okay, recently, researchers at the Bradley-Hesbrod Children's Research Center in Rhode Island  God, lucky devils at this place, huh?  Yeah, uh-huh.  Suggested that...  Oh, f***. 
[00:26:00]  Sex.  ...is on the rise among teens and young adults, particularly those who have unprotected regular sex.  Wow.  Experts say girls and young women like Carrie are often persuaded to try sexual behavior for the wrong reasons.  To please a partner, to have sex without the risk of pregnancy, or to preserve their virginity.  Yes.  But many don't understand the health consequences.  What?  What kind of health consequences?  This is...  Don't ruin this!  All right, I'll skip that paragraph.  And when women engage in...  F***ing sex.  ...tissue may tear more readily, causing direct blood exposure to infected fluids. 
[00:26:30]  Wow.  Yes.  Saw that coming.  Young adults confirm the reports of a rise in...  F***ing sex.  ...including the perception that it's safe.  I know some teens who did it just to try, and some who didn't have a condom available,  said one 18-year-old Californian, who did not want her name used.  I think that it's less taboo simply because people are more open to trying new things, said  her 23-year-old sister. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  The younger crowd might be scared by the idea of getting pregnant, so they assume it's safer.  It takes a great amount of trust to try something new with somebody that you may or may not like,  she said.  I'd consider it if there was a ring on my finger.  Otherwise, I feel I'd be losing some of my dignity as a woman.  Well, you would.  Let's be honest here.  In the Hasbro study...  I like they have to keep it...  Hasbro?  Isn't that a toy company?  Yes, it sure is, Anthony.  Hasbro.  It sure is. 
[00:27:30]  In the Hasbro study, females who had sex were more likely to be living with their partners  to have two or more sexual partners to have previously experienced, coerced...  What?  This sentence doesn't make sense, does it?  In the Hasbro study, females who had a sex were more likely to be living with their partners  to live with their partners, comma, to have two or more sexual partners and to have previously  experienced, coerced, intercourse. 
[00:28:00]  Okay.  Okay, so they had had a couple of partners already.  Right.  They live with their current partner.  Right, there you go.  And they were coerced into some kind of sex they didn't want to have.  Right.  Males who engaged in this behavior were more likely to identify themselves as being...  Homosexual?  Males who was...  Bisexual.  Oh.  Or undecided.  Well, that's kind of...  That is risky behavior if you're, you know, switching. 
[00:28:30]  You're a switch hitter.  Uh...  Oh.  B***h.  Sex.  Statistics indicate that a generational change has occurred, where people born in the 1980s  and later may be more comfortable admitting to or showing interest in...  B***h.  Sex.  Experts attribute interest in the behavior among heterosexuals, in part, to the proliferation  of pornography in the 1990s.  As with other sex trends, girls are more open to experimentation because pornography has  become so easily accessible on websites like... 
[00:29:00]  And they give all the fun websites.  Fun sites.  Blank tube.  Blank tube.  Yeah.  A lot of blank tubes and blank porns.  Foundry.  Sites and foundry, right?  Oh.  Well, but with fewer educational media outlets and less sex education, young girls are clueless  about hygiene, possible bladder or vaginal infections, and life-threatening diseases  like...  AIDS!  AIDS!  Ah!  Right.  It's very... 
[00:29:30]  I was reading some stats last night.  And it is very difficult for heteros...  Strictly heterosexual people to transmit AIDS.  Unless, you know, you're an IV drug user, something like that.  If you're just hetero, you go wild.  You don't have much to worry about, right?  Yeah.  And if your sexual partners have been, you know, of a similar ilk...  Uh-huh.  You know, if you're not running around with the fast crowd, you pretty much are right. 
[00:30:00]  We're hearing, by the way, the speech that Anthony has given to many on different occasions.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, please, don't think I mean this as fact.  No, I was just showing you how I operate.  Anthony Newton, like, laying on the side in the pillow, going...  No, it's nothing.  Here you go.  Let me show you something I printed out.  Looks like someone had a little paranoia last night.  I had to look up some stats.  Looking up some stats.  That was when I was going through all kinds of things.  You ever get on...  Well, obviously, you have. 
[00:30:30]  You get on the computer, and you're doing one thing, and then you end up somewhere else.  Yeah.  And that's what I did last night.  That's a big jump, though.  I just ended up...  Well, at first, I was on nmania.com.  Of course you were.  Of course.  Of course you were.  The n-word mania.com, which...  Oh, my God.  And then I got to some video sections.  They have a little section there of nothing but crime videos.  Yeah.  So I like a good crime video.  I like a good convenience store robbery video. 
[00:31:00]  Those are always fun when the poor Asian guy behind the counter has to use, like, a machete  or something.  He comes running out.  There's one hysterical one.  Three homeboys come running into a convenience store, guns drawn, and the guy behind the counter  pulls out his own gun, and they did a Three Stooges whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop,  where they're tripping over each other to try to stop their forward momentum to get back  out the door.  I was hysterical.  Did he shoot or no?  No.  He didn't shoot.  No one had a chance to do anything. 
[00:31:30]  They just ran out the goddamn door.  So they go from really tough to holy ass.  Yeah.  And then there's other ones where if I was working behind this counter, I would be like,  oh my God, I'm getting robbed before it even happens.  There's one guy walked in.  His hoodie was pulled so close you could barely see his eyes.  His hands were in the pocket of this heavy coat.  His head's down.  And he's slowly just milling about the front of the register area. 
[00:32:00]  And the guy behind the, poor bastard behind the counter is just like, oh my God, I'm getting  robbed.  What does that have to feel like?  And then the gun comes out, and he's getting robbed.  Right.  You know?  It's just, there's nowhere to go, nothing to do.  You just gotta be robbed, I guess.  That's horrible.  Scary.  I've been in an armed robbery.  It's frightening.  I know.  You talk about that.  Armed robbery.  Scary.  What was it?  A McDonald's or something?  Yeah, you just hear the yelling in the register.  Was it a McDonald's?  Because I don't want to, like, give him a horrible plug like that.  But, you know, the facts are the facts. 
[00:32:30]  But you're just, you're afraid you're getting a shot.  Then you go right down on the ground and do exactly what they said?  Well, me and my girlfriend were looking out the window at the time eating, like, there  was a side thing.  Just make believe it wasn't happening, and keep eating, and have inane conversations.  Yes, oh, you know.  It's August, three guys with parkas just ran in.  What do you think, hon?  Just yelling, going, it's August.  That's what it was.  It was August, and three guys with parkas.  Oh, my God.  See, there's a problem right there.  You know there's going to be some action.  I use my detective-like intuition to realize they couldn't be chilly.  It's 84 degrees out. 
[00:33:00]  My brother had an experience recently, very recently, where he was, well, it was before  it got cold.  He was on his motorcycle, stopped.  He was riding down from up north somewhere, and stopped at one of these rest areas where  you could get food.  You know, they got the big Burger Kings in there or whatever.  And parked his bike, went in.  It was about 2.30 in the morning.  No one in there but the employees and some guys, he said, that looked like they were gang  members.  You know, some real thuggish guys that really weren't doing anything except watching who 
[00:33:30]  was coming in.  And so Joe got his stuff and then turned around.  He had his helmet with him.  So he put his helmet on just in case, like, so he wouldn't be able to take a blow to the  head.  And he walks out of the place and notices right when he walks out, they all followed him out  to the parking lot.  So he did a quick walk, and they started walking faster, got on the bike, kicked that 
[00:34:00]  thing over, and they started running towards him.  And he gunned it, and they were running at it.  He said it was like something out of a zombie movie.  Maybe he just dropped his wallet or something.  Yeah, that must have been it.  They wanted to work him over and rob him.  How many guys were there?  He said there was something like five, six guys that were just milling around looking  for a mark, looking for some guy that was in there alone.  That's scary.  Coming in.  And, yeah.  Boy, they didn't rob the convenience store, though. 
[00:34:30]  No, no.  They didn't rob the store.  They were just hanging in there waiting for a mark.  It was a rest area.  Get them out.  Yeah, a rest area.  Where they have the coffee shop, the fast food joint, the bathrooms, a little magazine  newspaper stand thing.  He got out of Dodge real quick.  He was lucky.  And he said, he goes, he always has that kind of intuition or paranoia, whatever you want  to call it, but if there's somebody that just doesn't want to seem racist, those are called  victims. 
[00:35:00]  You know, Patrice does a great bit about it, about being a black guy and seeing guys with  shaved heads, skin heads.  He's like, he's not going to walk past thinking they're cancer patients.  You know, he's going to give them a wide berth.  It's the same thing.  If your intuition or some kind of internal little alarm goes off, you got to say to yourself,  look, I don't care if I'm offending somebody or something.  I got to protect myself.  Trust my instincts and either run, keep an eye out. 
[00:35:30]  Don't turn your back.  I watched the video because this is what I was doing last night.  I was watching videos.  And this one was in some Asian country.  Some gentleman goes in to an ATM, another gentleman walks in behind him, and the guy starts taking  cash out without paying any attention to the guy behind him.  It's a very small vestibule.  Now, I've been in those situations and kept a constant eye on who's behind me, sometimes 
[00:36:00]  even turning sideways where I could still block my PIN number, but I'm looking at what that  guy's doing behind me.  The mirror's there.  There's just ways to see what they're doing.  This guy has a knife, giant knife, just stabbing the guy.  He killed him.  You saw this video?  Yeah.  What's wrong with you guys with the death video?  You know what?  I can't watch the explicit one.  Security camera, though?  I can watch those.  That's why it wasn't as gory on the security camera. 
[00:36:30]  And it wasn't gory.  The guy collapsed in the corner.  The guy went through, rifled through, got his money, and ran out of the vestibule and  left him there to die.  But it's one of those things where if someone walks in while I'm at the ATM, during the middle  of the day, things like that, you're at a crowded one where there's like six across  and everyone's there.  It's a little more secure.  Secure numbers, I mean.  At night, I go to the drugstores.  Yeah, yeah.  You need people around you at two in the morning. 
[00:37:00]  I go to the corner stores where there's people.  No way am I going into the obvious bank ATMs anymore.  That's it.  Especially at night.  And with the economy where it's at, I'm telling you, more people are going to get robbed,  more people are going to get mugged.  One hand.  You've got to be more careful and be looking around a little more these days.  One hand punching in the number, one on the piece, my friend.  Nice.  One on the piece, one punching in the number, and keeping an eye out.  There you go.  If someone tries any shenanigans, that's it. 
[00:37:30]  Would you shoot?  If someone's trying to kill me?  Well, I didn't say kill.  They're just trying to rob you at an ATM.  That's a tough call, right?  Well, it depends.  If I feel my life is threatened, but if I'm being robbed, I would feel my life is being  threatened.  Yeah.  So you never know unless you're in the circumstance.  Sure.  Did I tell you that incident me and Kenny had at a convenience place recently?  It was nothing completely that would have required shooting.  Did I tell you, we were walking in this place at night.  It wasn't like a gang thing.  And we were walking out, and there's this big guy walks in. 
[00:38:00]  Did I tell you this?  Uh-uh.  And I walked out, and I could feel this guy staring at me.  Ah, see?  But he's a big white dude, and I'm like, I figured he was a fan, because I could feel  him looking.  And then there was two doors.  He actually circled right around and came right back outside the store.  So I figured he was at the show that we had just done.  And I feel him, and he goes, uh, you looking at something?  Oh.  It was like something out of a bad...  Oh, my God.  And I was texting.  I'm like, what?  I thought he was joking.  I thought it was a fan kidding. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And he's like, what?  Did I say something stupid?  And he was a big dude.  Oh, man.  And you could see that he was a problem.  Yeah.  And me and Kenny just stopped.  And I'm like, what?  And then I realized, Kenny told me after he had stared at the guy to make sure I got past  him okay when he came in.  So he might have been more annoyed at Kenny.  And we just got in the truck, and the guy's like, yeah, get in the truck.  Start the truck.  And he was like...  Start the truck.  Put it in reverse.  The guy was like, you better lock your doors.  Check your mirrors.  He just goes through the whole thing.  Check your tire pressure. 
[00:39:00]  What an ass.  Kenny could probably...  The guy doesn't even understand what Kenny could...  Yeah, but you don't understand.  Kenny's such a robot, he probably wasn't even phased by the whole thing.  He didn't move.  Yeah, Kenny's like, yeah, whatever.  Dummy.  Because Kenny never panics.  Never.  Never.  And Kenny...  Because Kenny is a big, big dude.  He's a problem.  And he also...  You know, let's be honest.  He has...  He's an ex-police...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got a license.  He might have certain resources at his disposal.  He might shoot you.  He might shoot you.  Right. 
[00:39:30]  And I said to him, I said to him, like, is this a case where if a guy  like that big...  Because he was a big, like, linebacker dude.  Sure.  Would you...  You know, is that a shootable guy?  And he's like, no.  I'm like, what do you mean no?  He goes, it has to be an equal force thing.  Yeah.  I'm like, if you had a gun on you...  I'm like, and that guy charged, if you had a gun, you wouldn't use it?  And he goes, no.  I would, you know, fight.  And then if you have to, you do, but you never...  That's Kenny, too.  Yeah, but Kenny knows what he's doing with his hands, too.  Yeah, he's 6'5".  Equal force is Kenny fighting that guy. 
[00:40:00]  Kenny's a big guy.  If you're a little guy and some monster's coming up to you, it's a questionable call.  But, you know, in certain circumstances, it's legitimate self-defense.  Yeah.  The big guy, you know, I'm talking about the store, but the big guy who we were across  at the convenience store, remember that guy?  Oh.  And I was asking if you would, if you would, is that, is it okay just to shoot that guy?  He was very drunk.  Yeah, yeah, he was drunk.  He was big, though.  Yeah, he was stocky.  To you, to Kenny.  He was like, eh, average size. 
[00:40:30]  What were you thinking?  Like, if this guy tried anything, he's drunk one punch, he'd have been down.  Well, it was the middle of the night.  We were coming out of the convenience store.  He was walking in.  So, you know, I gave him the once-over.  And then we were passing, and then Jim was behind me.  We heard this part.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you were getting, you know, yogurt.  The other thing you do very well.  But anyway, then we got out, and we were getting into my truck, and he's like yelling at us,  like, get out of here.  Like, what are you looking at?  He chased you away. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He sure got you.  Yeah.  But I'm saying, like, if he would have tried something, what would you, you just would  have, like, clocked him?  Yeah, he was so drunk.  He'd have been down.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  He was that drunk.  You would have had no problem with this guy.  Yeah, I'd chop him in the windpipe.  Just watch him make those funny sounds.  I'm not going to fight fair.  Nothing better than the chopped in the windpipe gasping for air sound that somebody makes.  Kenny, does that hurt? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah?  Yeah.  And then if I was in a good mood, I'd take out his kneecap.  Kenny's getting excited.  Kenny's all smiles just thinking about it.  Yeah.  And then I'd punch him in the stomach for good measure just to knock the wind out of him.  That he can't breathe through his windpipe with.  And then since he wanted my undivided attention, I'd punch him right in the heart so it will  skip a beat.  When you do the ear thing, the pew.  Oh, that one. 
[00:42:00]  The ear clap.  Yeah.  Where you increase the pressure in the ears by clapping your hands over the ear.  Thank you for reminding me of that.  Does that work?  Yeah.  I'll put that in my repertoire.  That one is really bad.  That could do some serious damage.  Yeah.  Can it kill you or just it'll rupture your eardrums.  Yeah.  You'll be bleeding from the ears.  That'll freak out.  I don't know about killing you.  All right.  The nose smash is always good, too.  Nose smash.  Sideways, though, right?  Don't go up because then you could kill him and then you're in jail.  Side of the nose?  You got to go sideways on that one. 
[00:42:30]  I don't know.  I know.  That's what I heard.  Just hit it.  Yeah.  You can't go up like this because supposedly the bone could go up into the brain.  There's a real bone in there.  It's cartilage.  No, there's bone way up high.  I think that's an urban myth.  Hell no.  The cartilage is attached to the bone.  About actually.  You ever see a skull?  There's like a slight bone way up here.  It's empty.  The nose is a big hole.  There's nothing there.  That's the cartilage part, but then it's attached to that bone that kind of protrudes.  The cartilage is squishy.  It protrudes out a little bit.  Give me a picture of a skull. 
[00:43:00]  Try your nose moves.  Can I push boogers into a guy's brain?  I'm not talking this part, Ann.  I'm talking way up here.  It's a bone.  Yeah, but if you hit him at the bottom of this, you're just going to squish his nose.  No, because it keeps going and then you get to that bone area and then boof.  I don't know about that.  I think that's urban legend.  Well, see?  Let's look into it.  It's very slight, but it protrudes out a little bit on the skull.  A little.  You've got to crack some of the brick in the nose.  Just enough.  Look, see?  At the top there.  How is that getting into your brain?  I don't know.  It hits between your eyeballs.  You break that?  You know, it fragments. 
[00:43:30]  E-Rock, get in here.  I want to do it to E-Rock and see if he dies.  He'll let us.  He's missing the part you need inside.  All right, we've got to take a break.  We really do.  So where were we?  Oh, sexting.  We've got to talk about the...  Sexting.  Basically texting naked pictures, all the kids out there.  Not all of them.  You might have one of the good ones, but a lot of the teenagers are texting naked pictures  around the school.  We are.  And we did the naughty sex thing. 
[00:44:00]  Oh, and then we got the teen.  She gets so excited, she lost her virginity on a class trip.  She accidentally texted the wrong person.  We'll tell you who that person is after the break.  Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton.  Moving right along.  We got a good one today.  We have a very sexy show today.  A sex thing.  We still got to talk about sexting.  That's something the kids are doing in school. 
[00:44:30]  Instead of, like, flirting like we did back in the day.  That day, whenever that was.  Yes.  But now they're just texting kind of, like, flirty pictures to each other.  Sometimes naked pictures to each other.  To get the attention of the opposite sex.  And then we got a girl.  She lost her virginity.  And she was so happy she wanted to text somebody and tell them about it.  And she texted the wrong person.  We're going to tell you who that is.  But right now, we got breaking news. 
[00:45:00]  Uh-oh.  Breaking sex news.  It's all about the sex today on the Opie and Anthony show.  No problem with that.  We got another teacher having sex with a student.  You never hear about this.  I don't know.  You're not going to hear this in the mainstream media.  But we love these stories.  Because it just brings us back to being, you know, teenage boys.  Filled with you-know-what.  Wanting to get rid of you-know-what.  And it's safe to say that pretty much every guy listening to this show wouldn't mind this happening when they were 15 or 16. 
[00:45:30]  I'm sorry.  That's just how it is.  Well, this is 17, apparently.  Right.  I mean, I guess there is a double standard when you hear about 15-year-old girls having sex with, like, male teachers.  There's more of an outrage, I guess.  But, guys, you know, we're hoping for this.  Every day we go to school, we're hoping for this.  I'd love to read this, but it's printed.  The writing is like fortune cookie writing. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  The text is so small on what is printed here.  Well, and I'll take care of...  It's nearly unreadable.  No, I'll take care of this one, being the youngest one on the show.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, you had your eyes done.  Shut up.  If I could read with my follicles, I'd be the best reader. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I got pretty much x-ray vision from getting my eyes done.  You need to read this font.  It's ridiculous.  It's horribly small.  Would you have magnifying glasses put in your head?  This font stinks.  Look, I'll tell you right now, they're not even advertising today, but this reading, courtesy of Diamond Vision.  That's right, people.  Sure.  I had horrible eyes, no glasses, no contacts.  At the time, they got me down to, what, 2015?  And I could read this font like it's nothing, my friends.  Michigan teacher accused of having sex within view of students. 
[00:47:00]  See?  Look at me.  Read that like...  That's the headline.  It's big.  Oh.  There's...  You don't notice those...  That isn't, like, scribble under it.  It's actual words.  A former Michigan high school...  See, now I have to slow it down a little bit, because it is very tiny.  A former Michigan high school teacher was in court Monday after being arraigned on a charge of indecent exposure and having sex with a student.  How hot is this?  Yay.  Why can't the mainstream media say, how hot is this, ever?  Editorializing?  Yeah, but they editorialize all the time. 
[00:47:30]  That's the new thing with the news.  Like the guy with the 16-year-old teen thing we did earlier?  Couldn't say it enough.  You don't think that guy was a little turned on by that story?  A little.  A little bit?  A little.  I'm sure he can't really say that.  He'd be fired, but, you know...  He's a red-blooded male.  I hate when they say that.  A red-blooded male.  What the hell does that mean?  He's got red blood in him or something.  Well, but don't we all?  Kelly Ann Abdo, it looks like, of Luna Pier, pleaded innocent to the count. 
[00:48:00]  I love when you get caught red-handed and you still plead innocent.  Monroe County Prosecutor William Nichols' office said Abdo is accused of...  ...having sex with a student in a car on a public street next to a house where there was a high school party going on.  See, perhaps they should have gone down the road a little further.  Yeah.  Instead of in front of the house, you know?  Other students told the prosecutor's office that they saw the two naked in the car.  How hot is this?  Who are these other rats?  I know. 
[00:48:30]  Someone's always got a rat.  God, a bunch of busybodies.  It's the nerds.  It's the jealous.  That now rule the world.  It's the jealous guys, too.  Which are the nerds, for the most part.  They saw the naked woman there and the guy, and they're going at it.  And it's like, hey, I'm not getting any tonight.  I'm ratting.  Yeah, but it's not like the cool kids, because they think they're going to have a turn.  Yeah.  It's the ones that have no doubt in their mind that this would never happen to them.  They're the ones telling. 
[00:49:00]  Other students told the prosecutors, okay, they saw them naked in the car.  Wow.  The prosecutor's office also said Abdo is being investigated, but has not been charged in  another case involving inappropriate sexual relations with a 17-year-old student.  Look how hot she is, too.  She's not that hot, dude.  She's okay.  Really?  The picture almost has.  It's a little blurry.  She's a dumb face.  Well, we have a theory on this, and we did this bit on the show.  Ugly teachers get way more time for this.  Oh, hell yeah.  Than the really hot teachers.  We went down the list, and the pigs were getting, like, 10 years, and the hot blondes 
[00:49:30]  with the blue eyes were getting, like, probation.  Yeah.  I'll tell you something.  As far as ethics goes, there's a problem.  But as far as the age goes, the guy's 17.  Just stop.  There's no problem there as far as some kind of an age thing goes.  But a teacher and a student, there is a conflict there.  I mean, you can't have a teacher banging a student kind of makes disciplining the class 
[00:50:00]  a little difficult, and they can just yell out, you know, hey, slut, what's the answer  to, you know, the problem on the board?  Yeah.  Hey, whore, I don't want homework tonight.  And the kid's 17.  She doesn't look like she's more than 25 tops, right?  Yeah, she looks like one of those teacher's aid things.  Kind of right out of college, started teaching.  And she might be as young as 22, 23.  What was that?  She's a mountain person face.  It was either Jimmy farting, or we had those big bullfrogs in the studio somewhere. 
[00:50:30]  She looks like the, I recently watched from Deliverance, the banjo kid.  She had that same type of dumb face.  Just a vapid look.  That's a horrible visual.  I think she's better looking than that.  She's awful.  I got to see a better picture.  Horrid banjo kid.  Oh, what a face on him.  I want to know what happens to that kid.  They just showed him, he's 52.  He's 52.  Really?  Yeah, I swear to God.  He's 52?  Yes.  Let's see the picture.  Are you lying?  Are you acting?  No, he's not acting. 
[00:51:00]  It's wonderful.  You're using a tissue in your hands so they're not moving awkwardly?  No, it's actually true.  Abdo was a math teacher and volleyball coach at the Monroe High School.  She has since been on paid administration leave since the accusations began in May after  an internal investigation.  She'll be back in court February 19th.  She got an internal investigation.  Love those stories.  Yeah, the sexy teacher.  It brings you right back to reaching puberty and just wanting to. 
[00:51:30]  I see nothing wrong with that though.  17?  Nah.  I remember, you know, at 17, there was no problem with that.  You're not going to be traumatized because you're having sex with somebody that's older.  Hell no, you're paying more attention in class.  Map it.  So, what is it?  A child.  Yes, merely a child, right?  It shouldn't happen, obviously, but it's really not going to damage the...  It shouldn't happen because it's not going to damage the... 
[00:52:00]  Teacher-student, not because of the age.  That's just silly.  It's not going to damage the boy too much.  Someone recently did get in trouble because of some kind of a teacher-student thing, but  they were 18.  So, it wasn't the age, but the teacher got in trouble because, you know, there's some  kind of law in the books that says an educator cannot have sex with a student.  Right.  And it's a law that you can go to jail for.  Even a college professor?  It all depends on the state you're in.  Wherever it was that I was reading, and of course, I don't have all the information, 
[00:52:30]  it was a crime.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Crime, yeah.  All right, let's get back to the sexting thing, finally.  Slacks.  We just did some off-roading.  We're back on the highway.  Slacks.  What do you got there, Jimmy?  I'm just looking at old footage of Joe the Plumber waving...  Why would anybody listen to this guy?  I don't get it.  Because he's got a big head like the Great Kazoo.  He looks like Bruce Willis.  Who cares?  Well, the latest, he's...  What is he saying?  What's Joe the Plumber saying? 
[00:53:00]  Says John McCain appalled him.  This guy just wants to keep his fame going as long as possible.  He's got a book out.  What?  And he's doing a book tour.  What?  And on the book tour, he said on a radio show that he got upset when...  Well, I hate your guts?  No, I don't think so.  I think it might be Joe the Plumber.  Oh.  What could he possibly write about?  Plumbing.  There I was, fluxing a fitting.  What's the name of his book?  I'm not...  I'm sure it has some... 
[00:53:30]  Laying pipe.  I was going to say, some twist on a plumber thing.  Yeah, yeah.  On a plumber thing.  But he's taken the average Joe position that Americans didn't like the bailout, and he got  upset when McCain supported it.  You know what's...  That's what ticked him off.  You know what's worse than Joe the Plumber writing a book?  The people that are going to buy Joe the Plumber's book.  I don't think it's going to be that many.  Who the hell would buy a Joe the Plumber book?  Everyone is sick of this douche.  Yeah.  Why would you...  Are you going to wrap it up and give it to someone for Christmas? 
[00:54:00]  The Joe the Plumber book?  Ugh.  Die.  Even I've had to step back and accept the fact that Obama is going to be the president  in a few weeks.  Yeah.  I've even had to sit back and just go, all right, look, I'm going to have to deal with  this.  It's not like Joe the Plumber has any new insight or anything that I'm going to want  to read about or care what he says, his opinion.  I kind of like the way he jumped all over Obama in that moment. 
[00:54:30]  You can't turn a moment like that into an entire career.  Jesus.  Well, I actually look up to Joe the Plumber.  I find his insight to be keen, and I think he tells it like it is.  I'll read his book.  I'll give his book a quick read.  Proper usage of a plunger.  Yeah.  Chapter 8.  Logs.  Yeah.  Travis, you got the name of the Joe the Plumber book?  It's Fighting the American Dream, and it's currently sitting at number 13,329 on M. 
[00:55:00]  Amazon.  Yeah, but is that pre-sales?  Yeah, it comes out this month.  Oh, wow.  Who's buying it ahead of time on Amazon?  Can we please get Joe the Plumber and interview him?  Yeah, we would love an interview with Joe the Plumber.  And only ask him.  Make that happen.  Only ask him plumbing questions.  Plumbing questions.  You know, sometimes my toilet makes that running sound, and I've even tried to bend that little  metal bar with the big ball in there, and it just still runs.  Do you think it's about time I replaced the innards with a new flapper system? 
[00:55:30]  Joe, what do you think?  How's the best way to unplug a toilet if you don't have a plunger?  Joe, I'm refinishing my basement.  I've got a lot of pipes.  Should I go with polyethylene tubing or copper?  Yeah.  Joe, is it true that rats can come up out of your toilet?  Yeah.  Or is that an urban myth?  If you ever see an alligator flush down there and then eat a con-ed worker, Joe, question?  How many condoms have you really seen in the sewer system?  I would love to call Joe the Plumber over because my toilet was clogged and have him 
[00:56:00]  unclog it and find out that it's all just pages from his book that was crumbled up and  flushed down my toilet bowl.  He's got to pull them out and go, hey, wait a minute.  And then have an extra book that you can hit him over the head with and go, beat it, stupid.  Leave, dummy.  That's right.  Take a hike for yourself.  Joe the Plumber.  Everyone gets to be famous.  Everybody.  Yeah, well.  Enough with this Joe the Plumber.  How much money did he get to write a book? 
[00:56:30]  Don't be a plumber hater.  Snake this.  Yeah, that's what it's called.  Snake this.  I'd imagine he got a few hundred thousand to write this book.  Easy.  Yeah, probably.  Easy.  Does anybody think that it will be a relevant, really enjoyable book?  Who cares?  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  We'll do the sexting thing, hopefully after the break, if we could keep a focus here.  Impossible.  And then we got the girl.  She loses her virginity.  She's excited.  She wants to text a friend.  And then she texted someone different by accident. 
[00:57:00]  Oops.  And Jimmy might have a little something on that and how that happens, right?  Yes.  A little insight to that.  And then you got women taking a bath at a KFC in the sink where they wash the dishes.  Hey, this happened recently.  Yeah, that's kind of a hoo-hoo-hoo, you're ripping me off thing.  We'll explain next.  And then the Germans, those wacky Germans.  What are they up to now?  Don't tell me.  Wait a minute.  Taking over the world. 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  And I think we have to be more sensitive because of Marcy yesterday.  So maybe we could get permission to do this story from a certain part of the community.  Well, I don't understand.  What are the Germans up to?  I can't wait.  I'm going to tell you ahead of time.  I'm not using this as a tease, but we'll get into this.  German nursing service caters to gay elderly.  German nursing service caters to gay elderly.  What's the difference between gay and hetero elderly?  When you're elderly, you're not really. 
[00:58:00]  What, you can rest on their nose?  The difference is the age.  He remembers the actual Roman war helmet.  He's really used in battle.  Right.  When gay elderly starts at, I don't know, 40.  Yeah.  Gay is so much for the young.  Yeah, we've talked about that.  I know.  We think, anyway.  Old queens are sad.  They're just sad.  Lonely.  We'll explain next. 
[00:58:30]  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  What's up, America?  We're still broadcasting to America.  Just in a very different way these days.  Eight, seven, seven, two, one, two, ONA.  It's Opie and Anthony.  We're looking at the Jennifer Aniston pictures that are in the paper today.  She did a photo shoot for GQ magazine.  And in one shot, she's just, she just has a tie.  You can't even call it wearing a tie. 
[00:59:00]  It's kind of just draped over her, like, her neck.  And one side of the tie is just covering one of her boobies.  It's covering up, yeah, the nip area.  She's 39, doesn't look anywhere near 39 years old.  Very, very nice.  And I were discussing that during the break.  The older the women get, the more they have to kind of do some trickery in the bedroom.  Yeah, yeah, you got to... 
[00:59:30]  To show off that ace.  The ace is very important.  And you got to stretch it, you know?  Yeah.  If the skin loosens up on that A, then you got to make sure you're bending your legs a lot.  Girls understand that, and they do a little voodoo.  Eventually, they have to go into TP position to make it look like anything.  It's like hands and knees, and then, like, lean all the way back.  Yeah.  And that stretches it out pretty good. 
[01:00:00]  For the younger women, they do the plank.  Oh, they can lay down, they can arch their back.  They don't even need to at first.  They're backwards.  And then you get older and older, and you start, like, going like this.  Snare drum.  Yeah.  All right.  So check out the Jennifer Aniston pictures.  They're pretty good.  They're pretty good.  There you go.  Let's see.  Look.  Young broad.  That's what they do.  Very basic position.  They don't have to, like, do any craziness to make it look good. 
[01:00:30]  The older you get, though, man, it's like a hinge.  You got to, like...  You got to...  You got to touch the back of your head to the top of your ass.  Like, yeah, is that stretching out?  And then tuck your knees into your chin at the same time.  What's that yoga pose called?  Meet Elizabeth Freisinger, I'm going to say.  Meet Elizabeth Freisinger.  She lost her virginity and accidentally texted her,  Dad! 
[01:01:00]  Pretty rare for this vicinity.  Quint.  Ah, that little rhyme he did.  I should have known that one.  Virginity.  I should have known that one.  I'm going to be depressed all day now.  Save to virginity to 103.  I don't remember the actual poem, though.  Damn it.  Me neither.  Eh, screw it.  Well, why don't we meet Elizabeth Freisinger, okay?  Let's meet her.  That's what the headline says. 
[01:01:30]  Meet Elizabeth Lizzie Freisinger, 18.  Isn't she precious?  Aw.  That's what it...  I'm just reading.  Is there a picture?  Yeah, she's hot.  She's, uh...  She's eight.  She's eight.  Oh.  Why don't I have these pictures?  Um, because you're not privileged enough to have them?  You know, it is ridiculous.  Uh, this should be, um, right on top.  It's in your pile.  It probably isn't.  It's in your pile of stories.  Ann ignores his pile.  Yeah, he doesn't look at a pile. 
[01:02:00]  Ann never looks at his pile.  Why would he?  Why would he?  Why would you look at your pile?  The pile with the pictures.  I don't see this picture in my pile.  Is that an ant's pile?  You got a pile of stories every morning you could leaf through there.  Ann, there's piles.  And then we see which ones we like, and we go with.  So today we decide to sex it up a little bit for everybody.  Oh, my God.  I know.  We'll get to that part.  Oh, my God.  Don't do the big reveal yet, Ann.  Please don't do it.  I'm not, but I'm just looking, and oh, my God.  You see the abrupt changing of the subject?  Here we go. 
[01:02:30]  Meet Elizabeth Lizzie Freisinger, 18.  Isn't she precious?  She's also mind-blowingly stupid, but not according to Jim Norton.  Jimmy thinks that this is very easy to do.  Elizabeth, a senior in Cleveland.  Let's get her on the phone.  Went on a class trip where she lost her virginity on the beach.  Apparently, it was GR8.  Oh, yeah?  What was the name of the John and Kate Plus 8 book?  I don't want to forget that.  Oh, bless babies.  Bless babies.  She said it was great.  Grubber.  What does grubber mean? 
[01:03:00]  We know this because young Lizzie was so excited about her conquest, she texted her friend.  Except it wasn't her friend.  She accidentally texted her dad.  Ouch.  Glass trip finished.  Cue a slap to the forehead and widespread humiliation on the interwebs.  Oh.  Wait a minute.  The only person that would spread this.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had.  And I've had him all over the world.  All right, now I'm really confused. 
[01:03:30]  So, you're a girl.  You lose your virginity.  You text it to your dad by accident.  How are we reading about this today?  Unless she texted it to a whole bunch of people and they went, oh, my God, you also texted it to your dad?  Let me read more and see if we can get to the bottom of this.  Since then, a pic of Elizabeth's iPhone below has been doing the rounds of the Internet.  And a classmate of hers leaked her senior year picture to a Cleveland radio station to complete the story.  Enjoy your 15 minutes of fame, Lizzie.  We are sure this will help you win friends at Syracuse where she has early acceptance. 
[01:04:00]  As yet, no name or photos have appeared of the lucky man.  I'm thinking somebody took a picture of it.  She was like, could you believe what I did?  Oh, my God.  And then someone went, oh, crap, let me take a picture of that.  Yeah.  And then took a picture of it and then spread it around.  Yeah, spread it around.  Because the dad's not spreading this around.  Like, look at my lovely daughter, what she's up to. 
[01:04:30]  When I heard it, I want to read the text and then we want to get to you, Jimmy, because Jimmy's going to defend this a little bit.  So they got a picture of the iPhone and up top it says dad.  So obviously she's texting dad by accident.  You know what?  I'm calling shenanigans.  I was thinking Bravo Sierra myself.  Yeah.  Why are you saying it?  Just because it's on the net, actually.  Before that, I was thinking.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying it for?  She's got AT&T service and I see five bars of... 
[01:05:00]  Nice.  A little cell phone joke for everybody.  Yeah.  It says dad at the top and the first text is Lizzie and she writes OMG, which is oh my God.  We all know that.  Yes.  Just had first time on beach GR8.  Exclamation point.  Yeah.  Wish you were here.  That's what she wrote.  Yeah.  So the returning text says, I'm assuming this was intended for someone else, Lizzie. 
[01:05:30]  At that point, Lizzie's like, no.  And then she looks and goes, oh my God, I just texted my dad.  Yeah.  So then Lizzie, quick on her feet, she writes back, class trip is over tomorrow.  No, no.  This is the father again.  He's continuing to write to her.  Oh, is that how that works?  It's okay.  I'm really sorry, Jimmy.  So he continues by saying, class trip is over tomorrow, 7, 10 a.m. Delta flight number. 
[01:06:00]  Use my credit card for taxi.  He wants her out of there.  He is pissed.  Yes.  Get home.  Immediately.  I have another reason for shenanigans now that I'm looking at this a little further.  All right.  So she texts the father and the fine, like with the iPhone, if you're having a text with somebody,  there won't be a timestamp, but if there's a big enough gap between communications, it'll  re-timestamp.  Yes, it will.  You know, when a communication comes in.  So you're to tell me that she texted her father by accident and within a few minutes was able 
[01:06:30]  to book a flight and text it back to her without a timestamp ever coming up.  Yeah, exactly.  That might have...  How quick on his feet was he to book her a flight almost instantaneously?  Because there's never...  I mean, if I leave my iPhone for two minutes without a text and then someone texts me,  it'll update the timestamp to...  Yep.  You know, so...  I know exactly what you mean.  But sometimes there has to be a big gap.  You're right, but I've had this thing with the iPhone.  She's a virgin.  What are you talking about? 
[01:07:00]  Oh, oh.  Wait, what did I say?  You're talking about...  Oh.  Big gap.  I'll have this...  Hold to you.  I'll open this.  I will a lot of times open my iPhone.  And the way your text works, you have a bunch of your names and the beginning of each text  is listed.  So say I open it up to my friend who I was talking to, Bill Shatner.  And I'll...  Oh, certainly not.  And I'll text something and I'll send it and then I'll realize that even though his name  was at the top, something in the computer on the phone had messed it up and it's been 
[01:07:30]  sent to the wrong person.  Many times I've gone to open one and I hit the name, like one name here, page.  Open it.  Boom.  Different text from somebody else.  Yes.  It screws it up and I've had that happen a lot.  So I'm always very careful about what I text.  I have texted the wrong person.  And I know...  I know how to read.  Yeah.  You know, I know if there's, you know, a big TS at the beginning of their name, I know  what I'm doing.  You know, so that happens.  And the timestamps, you'll get a timestamp, but a lot of times if you text someone twice 
[01:08:00]  in a row, like it was her texting her dad and then he texted, then he texted, and the  timestamp was not, the gap was not that big that that could show up without a timestamp.  You know what else I've had happen on the iPhone?  Where you type in your text, you send it, you get a text from somebody else, and then  the text you just sent is in the box waiting to be sent to this new person.  Many times.  What?  The thing you just sent to the right person is now sitting there waiting to be sent. 
[01:08:30]  You got to backspace and delete the entire text before you type in something different.  If you hit send accidentally, you'll send it to another person.  Not with the BlackBerry, my friend.  There is a little bug that they got to fix with that.  I love the BlackBerry.  That little problemo.  So, yeah, I don't know, man.  Something seems fishy with this whole thing.  Stays in the scent box, too. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  It would have been hot, though.  In a text?  Shut up.  If she wrote, oh, my God, I just had a first time, wish you were here, and he wrote, I  assume this was intended for someone else, Lizzie, and she went, no, Dad, it wasn't.  No, Daddy.  No.  No, Daddy.  I've been watching you from afar.  Anthony, here lies the body of Mary Lee.  Died at the age of 103.  For 15 years, she kept her virginity.  Not a bad record for this vicinity.  There you go. 
[01:09:30]  Hey, Chiefie, don't forget your rubbers.  Ha ha.  What part was that?  That was when they were loading up the boat, the orca, to go out, and, you know, Brody's  wife was all freaking out that he was going, and he was just, you know, yelling like a  crazy man, Captain Quint.  Yeah.  And he blurted that little poem out.  In the book, she had sex with Hooper.  With Hooper.  With Richard Dreyfuss' character.  Yes.  She had an affair with him. 
[01:10:00]  Really?  And I think he died in the book, too.  Yes, he did.  I do remember that.  Well, that's...  Yeah, he got it.  According to Peter Benchley.  I'm not reading that stupid book, then.  Wow.  I'm not reading a 35-year-old book.  Congrats.  Some books you don't need to read after you see the movie, you're like, wow, this is  really good.  I don't need a different version of this.  I do remember being a youngster in school and seeing some girl carrying around the book 
[01:10:30]  Jaws, and I looked at the cover, and I remember saying to myself, that looks so stupid.  I go, I just, I couldn't imagine anyone being entertained by anything like that.  Was the book cover of The Girl Swimming naked?  Yeah, it was pretty much the same thing.  Oh, I thought you were going to say, you were thinking to yourself that you could, you  know, take care of yourself to that.  Yeah, you know, you could.  Going back to yesterday's show, or the day before.  Chrissy was great.  You know, the shark was, like, picking his teeth after being done with that. 
[01:11:00]  1970-whatever.  They didn't know what they found on the beach when they saw that pile of seaweed.  This was no shaving accident.  This wasn't Juan Epstein's head.  Oh, look at the little white lion cub born at the zoo in Serbia.  That's cute.  Look at him.  He can barely walk.  So he'll be lopping people's heads off.  Yeah, sure.  He's cute now. 
[01:11:30]  Fast forward six months, he's sucking a jugular dry.  I saw a great clip last night.  Like I said, I spent just hours perusing videos last night.  This dummy, and of course it's in some former Soviet crap hole country, is feeding a bear  that is chained up to a tree.  And this woman is just out of range of the bear, and she's holding this food up with her arm  really extended, and the bear would, like, get up, but it's chained, and she would drop 
[01:12:00]  the food in the bear's mouth.  Not understanding the concept of reach, because the bear at one point gets up on his hind legs,  and she's holding up, and the chain is taut against the bear's neck in the tree.  The bear cannot move any further forward.  But she's standing there with a little treat.  The bear sticks his claw out and grabs her and pulls her right into him. 
[01:12:30]  Oh, it came over.  You just hear her go, ah!  And the bear's just slapping her around, and then, of course, the trainer comes in with  some stick, and the bear let go.  But, oh, was she surprised.  Here it is.  Oh, nice!  Oh, it's fantastic.  Can we get that up on the website there, Stuntbring?  Yeah, ondaradio.com.  Good.  Wow!  I don't even think that's...  Yeah, there it is.  Look at this.  Look at the bear's reach.  Hey, I gotcha!  Oh, wow.  Hey, why don't you come over here, and maybe I'll have you as a treat. 
[01:13:00]  He grabbed her jacket.  Yep.  And those claws pulled her right in.  Look at that.  Is he biting her?  Biting her arm.  Trying to.  Maybe just sniffing her armpit.  It's got a fetish.  Yeah, who doesn't?  A little bear fetish.  Anne, are you a fan of nature?  I'm a fan of when fire wins.  I'm a fan when animals win.  Oh, absolutely.  I'm a fan when nature in general wins.  I saw another one where this guy with a bow and arrow shot a moose.  A big moosin' in the shoulder. 
[01:13:30]  And the moose just turned around and ran right at this guy.  He missed him.  But, man, was he pissed.  Moose said, you're not getting away with this one.  And moose are giant.  They are, like, people don't understand.  It's not like a deer with big antlers.  These things are huge.  You ever seen one?  Not live.  When we were living.  Maybe at the zoo.  No, when I was living in Boston, I saw one.  Yeah.  They'd show up.  Driving up in.  Yeah, no kidding.  Pigs. 
[01:14:00]  Them pigs.  Yeah.  And they would try to have sex with us, right, Anne?  Yes.  But we were good boys.  Of course we were.  How stupid were we back then?  No, I saw a moose on the side of the highway driving through New Hampshire.  Like you just said, you can't even comprehend how giant these things are.  Giant animals, those moose.  Just giants.  I had a problem with a moose one time.  It was an altercation at a Burger King.  I felt that he cut me.  And he said, I was here first with my friend.  And I said, no, you weren't.  You were a wild animal.  And he said, boo. 
[01:14:30]  Be more funny.  All right, listen.  Can we clear the field?  Clear the field.  Some men are going to do some drinking.  So we can do this sexting story finally.  Yeah.  And we'd like some participation from the youngsters out there.  877-212-ON-A.  New danger.  The kids are now sexting.  It's like texting but with sex.  Yes.  We'll explain next.  Opie and Anthony, stay there.  Welcome back to the Opie and Anthony radio extravaganza. 
[01:15:00]  I'm the featured guest today, Jim Norton.  Today.  And every day.  Yes.  All right, Anthony.  I'll say it.  God damn it.  I'm going to L.A. tomorrow to do the Viper Room tomorrow on Saturday.  Who cares?  Opie right now is dropping a deuce.  And he's got his little Opie legs kicked straight out.  And Anthony is sitting on my left eating fruit.  Fruit.  Do we hope Opie's okay in there?  Yeah, of course he is. 
[01:15:30]  I've never seen somebody that actually has to expel as much waste during the day.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  I don't even think that he processes food.  I think that basically his inside is a long tube.  And he goes right from mouth.  Yeah.  There's no intestine.  It's a gutter.  It's a giant gutter.  You're like a scared puppy all the time.  Dude, you just ate. 
[01:16:00]  It's like this is his process.  Gulp.  Bathroom.  How embarrassing.  Why?  That's why you're healthy.  We all try to time that.  That.  Did you hear me say that you were on the toilet?  Oh, yeah, of course.  That thing.  I heard the coming back music.  I'm like, I time this horribly.  Oh, boy.  You never want to be the guy that's still in the bathroom when the show comes back.  Hasn't you hit the water yet?  I'm a very healthy boy.  That's number four for today, by the way, if you're keeping track at home. 
[01:16:30]  Jesus.  I don't know why.  Wow.  I don't know why four.  Usually it's two to three.  Four.  All right.  You want to do the sexting thing finally?  Yes.  Yes.  And look at the phones lit with teenagers.  Oh, sex.  And even 13-year-old JC wants in on this.  He's good for one every once in a while.  Our little pal.  Yeah, our little buddy.  Let's get into this with this first clip.  Cell phones transmitting.  Hold on.  I don't know what the hell's going on with this. 
[01:17:00]  What?  Cell phones transmitting child pornography.  No.  You know, it's hysterical the way they put it.  They're just pumping it up, making it sound a little more outrageous.  Technically.  Technically, it's, yes, child pornography.  She could probably be right because, you know, when you transmit images like that, it is a crime.  And it is considered child pornography if it is somebody under, you know, whatever age.  I think it's under 18.  Photograph.  Uh-huh.  Photograph nude.  No.  No? 
[01:17:30]  No.  You're technically allowed to have photos of naked kids.  As long as they're not posed in pornographic.  There was a lot of these scumbag websites that were, like, where they had nude children and kids, maybe not totally nude, but they were doing kid things.  Yeah.  Not being posed seductively.  And they got away with this on this stupid technicality.  So I think it's about being sexually suggestive as opposed to just running through a field or whatever.  I think if you have a nude photo of a pubescent girl, I don't care what the hell she's doing. 
[01:18:00]  I think you're in trouble if it's found.  I don't know about that.  I think so.  Because Mapplethorpe did with art.  Robert Mapplethorpe had a weird thing with art.  Well, they were talking like some coffee table books would have been considered child porn.  And I think they still are.  Like, they're, you know, no one would enforce it.  But technically, the letter of the law, it's a crime to possess that stuff. 
[01:18:30]  That was Pee Wee Herman's defense.  He had a lot of young nude boys' photos.  And he said it was, you know, it was art.  He was a collector.  And I don't think they bought it.  Well, did he go to jail?  No, but I think he, you know, had to.  I don't think he went to jail, but I think it was a violation of his probation or something.  I'm not sure of the case.  I'm talking on my ass over here.  It ruined him.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, him and Jeffrey Jones, that principal, were file trading.  It's embarrassing. 
[01:19:00]  But who knows what one of them had on the computer that wasn't under that.  And again, from what I know, I remember because I remember the name of this one site that I was like, how is this not child porn?  How is it not?  The ones where they're dressed in bikinis and stuff and kind of pose seductively, but technically they're clothed?  Oh, maybe, yeah.  There's some of those.  What was that one that was the old one that we stumbled on, that Molly girl?  Well, I think she's 30 now.  That was so many years ago.  I think she was 30 then, too. 
[01:19:30]  You're not fooling anybody by going into the pigtails.  I don't know, man.  Why don't we get into this?  Because we got hot phones, hot phones.  Cell phones transmitting child pornography.  Yes, more teenagers than ever before are texting provocative pictures of themselves, either nude or partially naked.  They call it sexting.  20% of students admitted doing it in a new study.  Joining me now is the author of Kid Stress.  It's Dr. Georgia Whittakin.  She's a psychiatry professor. 
[01:20:00]  Hi, doctor.  She wrote a book called Kid Stress?  Kid Stress.  What stress does a kid have?  What stress does a little effer have?  Well, it's pretty stressful.  You know, peer pressure and trying to get laid.  Yeah.  It was pretty stressful.  Oh, come on.  It really was.  Compared to what we deal with now?  Not us.  I mean, our lives are pretty good.  But before we got to this point, it was a little rough.  It's all relative.  As a kid, you don't have...  I don't think your mind has as big a space in it for stress, so little things freak you out. 
[01:20:30]  Once you get old, you get all jaded and you don't give a crap.  Yeah.  But as a kid, there was a lot of stress walking around trying to cover up my goddamn cystic acne with my funny jokes and not getting laid.  What the hell is cystic acne?  Oh, it was horrible.  Big friggin' nodules.  Constantly walking around.  Looked like I was beat up.  It was terrible.  They didn't have Accutane back then. 
[01:21:00]  Did you bring in those pictures?  So I went to some stupid doctor and old Doc Esslinger back in San Juan Capistrano.  He goes, you know what I think you ought to try?  X-ray therapy.  X-ray therapy.  What the hell is that?  I don't know.  I didn't do it.  I wouldn't do that.  I'm not going to X-ray my head.  That's crazy.  Great.  I'll trade the acne for tumors.  Were you one of those...  Dummy.  You already had the tumors.  You were one of those kids that had it all over?  Oh, my God.  It was a wreck. 
[01:21:30]  It was a wreck.  I hated it.  Ugh.  I had the basic pizza face for my senior photo.  Nah, you...  I found those recently.  I'll bring those in.  ...and had, like, you know, regular...  Basic.  That's what I'm saying.  Regular pizza face, yeah.  Mine were ridiculous, like the size of your friggin' fist.  That big?  Oh, they were terrible.  One day I was in a mall and someone went, wow, what did the other guy look like?  I thought I was in a fight.  I'm like, thanks.  That won't...  I found a lot of money as a kid because I used to have my head down all the time,  so I'd find, like, dollar bills that people dropped on the floor. 
[01:22:00]  There was a plus to my zero self-esteem.  They were really that big?  Oh, dude, it was terrible.  As big as a fist, really?  Well, not a fist, but...  But how big, for real?  For real?  The size of this Gatorade cap would be one, like, on my cheek, and then another one, like...  Couldn't you pop that out there?  And I had nicknames for them.  Like, if it was on my jowl, I had a couple there.  I'd call it the, um, the, um...  What was that singer? 
[01:22:30]  Oh, goddammit, now I can't remember his name.  Lawrence.  Vicky Lawrence and...  Yeah.  No, Edie Gourmet.  Vicky and...  Steve, uh, Steve Lawrence.  Steve Lawrence.  I'd call it the Steve Lawrence, because he had the big jowls.  Then, if I got one on my chin, it was the Dudley Do-Right, because they looked like Dudley  Do-Right.  Then I had the Cyrano, if you got one on your nose.  And then the Frankenstein was one on the brow line.  And then, like, your cheeks would puff out.  It was awful.  What, what, what, is that, is that, uh, genetic, or is that food, or is that, uh... 
[01:23:00]  It's genetic.  It's just a genetic friggin' mess that I had to deal with.  And then, the best thing was, it was mostly out in California.  It just had, it was horrible.  Out in California.  And who was I hanging out with in California?  Who was my bestest friend ever?  Richard.  Richard, yeah.  And there's a son of a bitch that is, is, was gay, as the day is long, and every girl  was, was, was after this kid, because he was gorgeous, and, and here's his, his best 
[01:23:30]  friend.  They'd rather go out with a gay guy than you.  That's, God, I was just...  We wonder why your self-esteem blows.  Oh, my God, I, Rocky Dennis, his friend.  You should have let him slobber on it.  That would have been your vengeance over them.  Like, yeah, I know you guys want to watch this, zip, and then Richard.  Like a bird trying to pull a worm out of the ground.  Oh, it was horrible.  I used to go to the, uh, doc, because, and I'll tell you something, the doctors knew nothing  at the time.  Yeah.  Like, now, you take some Accutane, and the crap goes away. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, I, I tell you, if, if you're a kid, and you're having problems with, uh, acne, do  anything you have to do to get Accutane before you get any scarring.  Isn't that expensive, though?  Yeah, whatever.  Rob somebody.  What, what, what, what can I tell you?  To get the clear face.  How do your parents friggin' pay for it?  Yeah.  But, uh, they didn't know.  So, they, like, put you on tetracycline, some kind of antibiotic, just to try to, because,  yeah, it was an infection, just to try to get rid of it. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah, that's great.  That's how you looked?  Oh, worse.  Really?  Worse.  It was horrible.  Looking at a photo of the guy's lower part of his face.  Yeah, that's wonderful.  It looks almost like, a little bit like burn scarring, like, like, not burn scarring, but  like, uh...  Bubbling.  Bubbling, yeah, the bubbling.  Volcanoes.  It looks like the surface of, of, of volcanic planet.  And then they'd take, they'd put liquid nitrogen on it to, like, freeze it.  Wow.  It was just a horror show.  So, you were tortured by that?  Oh, tortured! 
[01:25:00]  All the way up until, you know, and then I figured, ah, it's a kid thing, it'll go away  at some point.  I'm in my 30s, and I was still dealing with it, until I finally went on Accutane.  And then, you know, they just went away.  Wow.  And they don't come back after that.  Was Accutane, when did that come around?  How old were you?  Uh...  He was at N.E.W., right?  Yeah.  I was at N.E.W. when I started taking Accutane.  Ten years ago, maybe.  Yeah.  Maybe a little less.  Ten years ago.  They'd had it before then.  But, um, I didn't get on it.  Uh, but yeah, it took care of it. 
[01:25:30]  One sitting.  You know, it takes, like, six months or something that you take these things.  It's weird, the warning labels on it, they show, like, if a pregnant woman looks at this  pill, the kid will come out with three heads.  Really?  Yeah.  It's a bad one, huh?  It's toxic stuff.  And then you gotta check your liver, because your cholesterol goes through the roof when  you're, uh, taking this stuff.  Why do you mean one sitting?  You had to go to a doctor?  No, well, like one sitting, one session, because sometimes it comes back.  Sometimes it goes away. 
[01:26:00]  Sometimes it don't go away.  And, uh, then you have to go on another six months or three months.  Yeah, that is an exact replica of something I would get on my face.  Cystic acne.  And let me tell you something.  When you jab a pin in that thing, and then squeeze it.  Nice.  It, it, you could fill up a pudding cup.  A shot glass.  A little vanilla pudding cup.  With cystic acne juice.  Oh, it was disgusting.  Would you do a shot of cystic acne juice?  Oh! 
[01:26:30]  God.  Would ya?  No!  Would ya?  It would spray on the mirror.  Really?  One of those.  Would they say, would girls say things to you that were, like, hurtful or make...  I wasn't even, um, close enough to girls for them to say anything odd.  I would steer clear of girls.  The only girl was, you know, Buzz.  And the girls down at the stables, they didn't care.  So when you lost your virginity to Buzz, you had this going on on your face?  Um, yeah, I guess at some point.  It wasn't as bad.  It got worse after a while.  And then it would get better. 
[01:27:00]  It would clear up.  And then it would get worse.  Like, it went in phases.  Right.  Uh, so, like, for, uh, not even a month.  I would say for maybe three weeks it would be alright.  And then it would come back.  And for a month, a month and a half, it was just a wreck.  And then, uh, it would mellow out a little bit.  But always just red and irritated.  How old were you when I started it?  Oh, God, probably 12.  See, can I theorize something?  Because that's so brilliant.  It's that, that, that scientific mind.  That guy who was going to be a scientist and build rocket ships. 
[01:27:30]  That, when you turn 12, that, that horror of being, like, physically not looking to girls.  Yeah.  Turned into, to, you being funny.  I had to.  Like, you probably wouldn't have gone into being so brilliantly funny if not, like, that defense  to make chicks laugh.  It was absolutely the way to just, like, get people, uh, laughing.  So, you know, take away from the, the horror.  They would forget about what's going on on your face.  Oh.  Look at this.  Explains a lot.  Oh.  It's horrid.  Alright, let's get back to the sex, uh, the sex thing.  We've been promising this all morning. 
[01:28:00]  Hopefully you're not just tuning in.  We're in the middle of a clip here.  This is Dr. Georgia Whittakin.  She's a psychiatry professor.  Hi, doctor.  Hi, Heather.  How are you doing?  Why are so many young people doing this?  Not just young women, but young men, too.  It's a time, adolescence, that you can think of as a time where they're joining a cult,  each other.  They're leaving the family.  They're trying to go into the world.  And they only have each other as their reference.  So, think of it as a time of initiation, as if they're getting into some kind of fraternity  or group. 
[01:28:30]  Blah, blah, blah.  Yeah.  Psycho babble.  I just hear white noise.  Psycho babble.  One of these psychologists and psychiatrists, whatever.  If she speaks quickly and loud, she thinks that she's really making a point.  It's no different than when we were growing up.  They just have different technology.  That's all this is.  That's all this is.  You say following the leader.  Do you mean, you know, these celebrities, Vanessa Hudgens, people who have sent their pictures  or pictures that have turned up on cell phones or Girls Gone Wild type of things? 
[01:29:00]  Young people are following those as their example.  No.  Say no.  We find that the main motivation of adolescence socially is to be approved of by others and  be noticed by others.  And yes, they see celebrities putting out sex tapes.  And it not only doesn't seem to hurt them, but it seems to help their celebrity.  No.  That's so not it.  You're so off.  I got to quit radio and become a psychologist.  Is that the one that just babbles? 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  When you have to ask, is that the one that just babbles?  It's probably not the right career move to make.  Well, I know one does the drugs and the other, like, lets you talk out your problems for hours  on end at an enormous fee.  She's putting this psychobabble psychologist logic into something that is so simple.  It's what a kid would do.  It's a little dirty.  It's fun.  It's, you know, taboo. 
[01:30:00]  And it's if it's your boyfriend or girlfriend, it's a cool way to like, hey, check this out.  Yeah.  It has nothing to do with what she's saying.  She's getting too deep into it.  Wow.  Holy mother of God and Jesus.  What the hell picture is that?  And email it to me.  No, that's very wrong.  No, that's very wrong.  Completely closed.  Uh, here's more to the Jesus Danny story. 
[01:30:30]  Seventy-three percent in the study said that they knew there were serious negative consequences.  These are the kids.  Why would they disregard that when they know there could be negative consequences?  These digital images stay with them.  We know that employers are now looking at people's Facebook pages before they go ahead and hire someone.  This stuff is going to come back to haunt some of these kids.  Employers, college admission boards, we've now heard for about six months that they are checking on the Internet.  And the problem is that when you're an adolescent, what you haven't lived through, you don't know about. 
[01:31:00]  So whatever you feel today is what you think you will feel always.  But the thing that's so, she's right about that, like you don't see the future, but jail has always been an option.  It doesn't stop kids from doing drugs.  It's like, you know, like, come on, they're intangible things when you're 15.  Some of these pictures would get you into an Ivy League college.  Who are you kidding?  Yeah.  There's a girl in a Playboy bunny ears who I just want to say, she's a home run.  Jesus Christ.  She's young. 
[01:31:30]  She's like 18.  Yeah, she looks of age, though.  She really does.  It's all in the face.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe.  Because we just stare in silence.  Wait, the last clip.  They close the segment, the male news anchor speaks on getting busted with child porn with  a little too much familiarity.  Well, young ladies out there, just don't do it.  Not worth it.  Dr. Georgia.  Yeah, they're watching your program. 
[01:32:00]  Don't do it.  Not worth it.  Not worth it.  Yeah, they're watching you instead of the hills, you dumb broad.  Well, young ladies out there, just don't do it.  Not worth it.  Dr. Georgia Wicken, thanks a lot.  And also, Bill, you have to wonder, if one child sends this to another child, and somebody's  over the age of 18, and somebody's under the age of 18, what are the legal implications  there?  It could be child porn.  You get burned one time, you'll learn your lesson.  Yeah.  And that's a tough lesson to learn for young men and women in the world. 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  Let me tell you.  Hey, let me tell you a little something.  You get burned one time, that's all it took me, all it takes.  Yeah, there's a little suspicion there.  Yeah, that guy definitely sounded like he'd been through it.  You know, and they put those cuffs on you, and take that mug shot for a sex offense like  that.  Whoa, whoa.  You know, every Halloween, why do you think I leave town? 
[01:33:00]  Dragging me out of the house with my computer.  Not fun.  Not fun.  Have to do that again.  Let's go to the phones.  We got Chris.  How are you, Chris?  Hey, Chris.  Hey, how you guys doing?  Good.  How old are you, Chris?  I just graduated high school last year.  I'm going to be 19 come the 20th.  Sweet.  What do you got going on?  Not much.  I'm just actually getting into work.  I called in with a pretty amusing story for the sexting thing.  All right.  Keep your radio down so we don't get distracted. 
[01:33:30]  So, what do you got on this?  In my high school, there was one girl who was 19, and she sent a picture of herself to  her ex-boyfriend.  Why she did this, I have no clue.  But the high school administration went and called in everyone who got the text.  Like, they tracked down numbers through different cell phones, and everyone was getting called  in.  And one of the kids, one of the girls who actually got called in, she was 17 at the time. 
[01:34:00]  She wasn't legally yet.  She had naked pictures of herself.  And the high school administrator was going through everyone's phone and found naked pictures  of her.  She was just trying to get her old boyfriend back, right?  That's why she would send a picture originally.  No, no.  She was like, oh, she actually was dating someone else and wanted to rub it in their face.  Oh, I see.  Rub it in their face.  And the whole rest of the day, I saw the administrator walk around with a big smile on his face after 
[01:34:30]  he looked at everyone else's phone.  Yeah.  This isn't pretty.  Someone has to look at these pictures.  Yeah.  It's the bottom of this.  Yeah.  All right.  I like when they have certain pictures, and not like the ridiculous, like really, the ones  that everyone would find sick and disturbing.  But you have some of the people like, you know, I was, wow, it was so tough to look at some  of these pictures of these exploited young women.  Young 17-year-olds.  Yes, yes. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, so just, you know, having to paw through the thousands and thousands of photos as his  shoes are filling up.  Tom and PA, how are you?  What do you got on this sexting thing?  Tom.  Hey there, Tam.  Let's go.  We lose Tom, all right.  Tom hung up.  13-year-old JC.  JC, come on.  You're too young to know anything about this.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  First off, Anthony, how's Dreamweaver? 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, Dreamweaver wanted to ride horses with me, even though I, you know, had the old pizza  face going.  Yeah.  But she was fat and I tore off.  What an ass I am.  I'm just one of these, like, you know.  You should have went with the fatty.  You should have went with whatever you could get.  You know, I know.  Beggars can't be choosy.  No kidding, man.  What's wrong with you?  Boy, was I choosy.  Start somewhere.  Hey, you're fat.  Anyways, the school close by to me, a girl was raped by two of the kids gray above her. 
[01:36:00]  Oh, that's fun, Jason.  Really?  Thanks for bringing some fun to the show today.  Yeah, before I got you at 14.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  In your school?  No, not my school.  It's a school close by.  I was going to say, what prison are you going to school in?  Jesus.  It's got smokers laugh at 13.  That's great.  All right, JC.  JC, thanks.  Later there.  There's not much we can do with a 14-year-old being raped. 
[01:36:30]  No.  Trying to keep it light here.  Trying to find some comedy in that.  Yeah.  Ed in Pennsylvania, how are you?  I'm great.  Good.  How about you guys?  Pretty good, man.  Hey, this is changing the subject a little bit, but I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener.  You guys are great.  But what I wanted to say is you guys are just more than purveyors of sick, twisted humor,  and I found that out yesterday.  Big Yankee fan.  I was listening to ESPN Radio, and then I lost the signal and immediately turned to you guys, 
[01:37:00]  and you guys broke the story of CeCe Sabathia coming to the Yankees before ESPN Radio did.  I told you, and no one believed us.  I'm telling you, this is happening.  Yeah, we're the Opie and Anthony Show, Ed's Second Choice, we like to call our program.  Yes.  Thanks, Ed.  Yeah, let's get new promos.  Ed's Second Choice.  Ed's Second Choice.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  You listen to ESPN Radio for, you know.  That stuff is worth listening to for maybe five minutes. 
[01:37:30]  Terrible.  Five quick minutes, and you know everything.  Oh, absolutely.  Hey, by the way, the Mets picked up Putts.  Yeah, JJ Putts.  Is it Putts or Putts?  Because it is Putts, right?  Looks like Putts, but everyone's trying to say.  But the Yankees refuses to say.  That's like when someone's last name is Kuntz.  Right.  It's the same thing.  So, you know, you could pronounce it another way.  Yeah.  But they're saying Putts instead of Putts.  Yeah, and they're making it very obvious. 
[01:38:00]  They don't want to say Putts.  Yeah, they're saying.  Is his last name Putts or Putts?  It's P-U-T-Z.  It's Putts.  It's Putts, right?  Putts.  Yeah.  I thought that was odd today.  The Mets picked this guy up, and all morning long, Putts.  Yeah.  They picked up Putts.  Yeah, you know there's a country called Niger?  I never knew that.  Let's say hi to Dean on Long Island.  Dean, how are you?  Hi.  Yeah.  I'm good.  I just have this terrible story of what happened to me and my girlfriend on our six-month anniversary. 
[01:38:30]  Okay.  We decided to take it to the next level.  Sure.  Why not?  Yeah.  Back to the city, blah, blah, blah.  Anyway, she goes to Lake George.  She texts me and tells me that her mom knows.  And I'm thinking she's joking because she likes to joke around like this.  She's dead serious.  She got a urinary tract infection.  I'm like, you're definitely pulling my leg.  And it was absolutely dreadful because then she lost service for three days, didn't talk to her.  She comes back. 
[01:39:00]  Her mom's like, you can't go out.  You can't do anything.  She brings me to therapy with her therapist over this entire thing.  You had to go to therapy because you had sex with her daughter?  Yeah.  Oh, run, man.  Run.  That's rough.  What did the therapist say?  Yeah.  And how old are you?  She was like, I'm 18 now, but when this happened, we were both 17.  It was just, oh, my God.  I'm still going out with her now. 
[01:39:30]  We're on almost 11 months now.  And she had us make a contract.  That's what the therapist said.  You should make a written-up document saying that you'll never do it.  Because she's only in high school.  You've had sex already, and they're telling you not to have it anymore?  Yep.  And then we have to make a contract saying that we want to do it.  All right.  Wait.  Hold on.  Hold on.  How's that working out?  Huh?  How's that working out, that not having sex? 
[01:40:00]  Uh, we broke the contract a couple times.  Of course.  Of course.  If you have sex with someone.  No one follows a contract these days.  If you have sex with someone once, and there's some kind of problem with the parents that  they decide you need therapy.  And you have to sign a contract.  The first, you're just, you're all over each other.  What the hell?  Are you kidding?  And you're 17 when this happens.  Contract.  What do they think is going on at 17?  She's a health teacher.  That's why.  What did the therapist say?  I know the contract thing, but what else did the therapist tell you? 
[01:40:30]  Just don't go A to M.  Oh, it's a natural thing, and most kids are drawn to this, but I mean, what if she was  to get pregnant?  She's only in high school.  Oh, then you'd have to deal with this, and your whole lives would be ruined, and I'm  like, oh my God, like.  Nice thick history book right to the gut.  Exactly.  I'm like, I know this already.  Put her on birth control.  I don't care.  Like, I used to, like I was saying, oh, but the condom can rip.  There's still a chance.  Dude, run.  Just run.  This sounds like a bad catch. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, the mom.  It was terrible, but I.  That mother.  It was ruined.  Yeah, meddling in problems.  She got a lot out of the moms.  And at 18, you should try to conquer as much land as you can, my friend.  What are you doing?  Get out there.  You should be a Viking at 18.  Let's say hi to Nick in Jersey.  Nick, how are you?  I'm doing pretty good, guys.  How are you guys doing?  Pretty good, man.  Right there, Nick.  Yeah, I went to, I don't know if I should say school, but just a school in New Jersey, 
[01:41:30]  South Jersey.  And we had a girl whose mother was a science teacher.  You know, she'd been there like 20 years, real respected teacher in the school.  And to be honest, she sucked to all the students.  And her daughter was like a nut.  And, you know, she was like a real party animal.  And her and, I guess, a couple of her girlfriends from a Catholic school in the same town that  nobody knew, I guess, had some fun.  Her and three other girls.  They took pictures of this whole event, you know, and they were some serious pictures. 
[01:42:00]  Things disappearing and everything.  But anyway, they got around school pretty well.  And it turns out one of the girls nobody knew from the pictures was one of the assistant  principal's daughters.  Wow.  So that, yeah, they got around school pretty good.  Everybody's email, everybody's cell phones.  And that was pretty embarrassing for the teachers.  And they were trying to address it, like, in class to let everybody know, you know, it's  not a big deal, this and that.  But you could just see how pissed they were.  And it was just great.  It was absolutely hilarious. 
[01:42:30]  There you go.  A little story from Nick.  Thanks, Nick.  Yeah, thanks, guys.  Take it easy.  Nick reminds me of something.  When I went to Geneseo, I was in a fraternity.  We all remember that.  Oh, yeah.  But the first thing they tell you when you get into the fraternity, don't wear your fraternity  colors in a certain classroom.  Because how the story went, it was an old communications teacher, very old.  He was at the end of his run.  But I guess years earlier, maybe, I don't remember anymore, but it was at least 10 to 
[01:43:00]  20 years, somewhere in that range.  His daughter went up to the fraternity house and had a lot of fun.  She had a lot of fun, Anthony.  And she wanted the lot of fun.  Yeah.  All right?  It was her doing.  But he found out, this teacher, and if any guy wore his colors in this particular classroom,  they would get failed immediately.  Failed immediately.  Because it would just bring back horrific memories for this guy.  Yeah, I'm sure he doesn't like the thought of a whole frat house on his little girl. 
[01:43:30]  But it was her doing, though.  What a stick in the mud.  Look at you, still defending it.  Hey, look.  That's the limitations.  We're fine.  It was before our time.  On a pinball machine?  It was way before our time.  What else?  What's a rainbow party?  Oh, I've heard of these.  Really?  Yeah.  Anna, Long Island, what's up?  Hi.  Well, we were talking about this yesterday because a lot of parents that I work with were offended 
[01:44:00]  by the texting.  And, oh, my God, my children aren't doing this.  I said, well, go and check if they have rainbow bracelets on when you get home.  And they had no idea what it was.  And there's a couple of versions of it.  But one of them is that the guys have rainbow, like, bracelets or, like, hair ties or rubber  bands.  They go to the parties.  And for every, oh, gosh, how do I say this?  Without getting dumped out.  Every act?  Every act that is performed on them by a girl, the girl gets a bracelet. 
[01:44:30]  So the more color she has, the more acts she has performed.  The better egg she is.  Wow.  Yes.  No kidding.  There's also a different rainbow party with lipstick.  Yes.  With lipstick where the guys would go around and try to gather up a rainbow of colors based  on girls' different colored lipstick.  So if you had, you know, a lot of color on there, it meant you were having quite the party.  It meant you were having a lot of fun. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Where is this really happening?  That's what I want to know.  It's happening on Long Island.  A lot of the teachers are saying they're hearing about it from their students.  Well, what high school?  We better do an investigation.  I have a big house that can host a party.  I've hosted a few parties.  From the Rainbow Coalition, though.  Have a lot of times.  All right.  Have it catered.  It'll be wonderful.  Thank you, Dana.  We'll take a quick break.  We'll continue with the phones.  They're pretty hot right now.  877-212-ON-A. 
[01:45:30]  Oh, absolutely.  Every time.  You're jamming. 
[01:46:00]  That's a guitar solo.  It reminds us of the horrendous guitar solo.  You know what?  We should do it here.  It's perfect.  Yes.  We're all about the radio segue.  I think this is a little better than you think it is, though.  They said this was really bad.  I kind of think it's great for you.  God, is that good, huh?  Timeless.  Maybe not.  We just think it is.  Huh?  No, of course it's Zeppelin, Jimmy. 
[01:46:30]  What?  And it's looped, so you can just do this all day.  No, we're all about to do that.  Hit it.  Not at all.  That's our new bit.  We're going to do the...  Because the totally do thing might be going away, but we'll start the...  Anyway.  Anyway.  I want to do this part again. 
[01:47:00]  All right.  Don't make me play the La La Christmas song, Jimmy.  I've been behaving today.  So that's a very good guitar riff, obviously.  We can get back to the phones in a second, because they're hot.  But a certain website...  We'll give out the website in a second here.  They did a vote to determine the worst guitar solo ever, right? 
[01:47:30]  Is there a lot of familiarity on the list there, Danny?  Yeah, there was.  I won't say the site so it doesn't crash, so I can pull it up real quick.  But there was some legitimate people, a lot of legitimate people on that list.  Like who?  Like Lenny Kravitz.  And as much of a talented singer-songwriter as Kurt Cobain was, he didn't exactly have lead chops.  Really?  He made the list for Smells Like Teen Spirit solo.  Well, live in concert stuff or on the record?  On the record, just because he didn't... 
[01:48:00]  I mean, all it really was was the vocal melody just on his arm.  So it was kind of like, all right.  Yeah, but when you think bad guitar solo, is that...  Yeah, you're not really thinking that.  Do you think Nirvana, really?  Well, I've thought it in the past, and obviously other people did, or else it wouldn't have been included on this list.  Sure.  Yeah, I'm not taking away from his talent, but I mean, he wasn't exactly somebody known for his guitar chops.  He's too busy screaming.  Is it robshow.com?  No, it's a different website, but that's a good one, too.  It's Rob Bartlett's site.  Jesus. 
[01:48:30]  Stupid Rob Bartlett.  He coming in today.  We're seeing Bartlett.  Yeah, just real quick for him.  This Saturday, he's at Gotham here in New York, and Sunday the 14th, he's at the Brokerage in Long Island.  Nice.  Rob is brilliant.  Now we like Rob.  So how do we do this, do you think?  I want to see the list in general.  I got it up right here.  Oh, the top seven worst guitar solos, right?  Yes.  Oasis.  Sorry.  Oasis, Champagne, Supernova.  What was wrong with that guitar solo?  That guitar kind of talked in that song.  I hate Oasis.  Hate them. 
[01:49:00]  Aren't they Beatle-ish rip-offs on some level?  Yeah, sometimes, but just that whining.  Champagne, Supernova.  Oh, all right.  No?  Champagne, Supernova.  Champagne, Supernova.  Another just repetitive crap.  All right, so you agree with that.  Oasis, Champagne, Supernova, number seven.  Thanks.  Worst guitar solo.  Number six, very sad to say, Nirvana smells like teen spirit.  Can we hear some of the song?  That one hurts.  That one hurts.  I'll try and pull some of it.  Yeah, we probably should have done this a bit better. 
[01:49:30]  We just went with it in a second here.  Number five, of course, Twisted Sister.  We're not going to take it.  What's wrong with the guitar solo in these songs?  I don't remember these songs for having bad guitars.  I'm going to try and pull them.  All right.  I know you're panicking now.  Lil Wayne.  Excuse me.  Leather So Soft.  Well, that's just so they make the list balance with all sorts of different artists.  You know what better be in there?  Yeah.  God damn, what song was it, though, from The Kinks?  It's one of the worst guitar leads I've ever heard in my life. 
[01:50:00]  It sounds like his fingers got stuck in the strings, and he's trying to pull them out.  What song is it?  Oh, it's one of the really popular ones, by the way.  You really got me.  It might be.  What are some of those other King songs?  What are some of those other King songs?  Oh, Sailor Light Heroes.  Lola.  No.  Lola.  No.  It might be You Really Got Me, then.  I think I have the part of the solo from Champagne Supernova queued up.  I think I understand why they put it on this list.  It's just very simple and repetitive. 
[01:50:30]  All right.  Let me hear it.  I like that.  Yeah.  I can't do any fronting on this.  I like this.  Harmony thing going on there.  He wasn't going for his Zeppelin thing.  How many spells are made for her?  Where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where, where's the living change?  Well, we, well, we were getting high.  All right.  Lil Wayne, leather, so soft. 
[01:51:00]  Stupid granola caught in the back of my throat.  Oh.  What's number three?  What's the non-clog your throat?  Oh, that's okay, Jimmy.  I knew as soon as I started saying that that you would get excited.  Gotta help you.  If you ran out of yogurt.  Yeah, exactly.  Some throat yogurt.  Oh.  Not a big fan of Lenny Kravitz, but he makes a list with American Woman.  What's wrong with that guitar?  I was never a fan of Lenny Kravitz.  Yeah, but he does all right with the guitar.  This is a dumb list, I'm thinking.  Number one better be really good.  I think actually number one is he can play.  We already know that, Jimmy. 
[01:51:30]  I was just making believe.  I think number one, he can actually play.  Yeah.  The Misfits, we are 138.  I don't know that song.  It's basically like a five and a half second, if you want to call it a solo, it's basically  the same note hit over and over again real fast.  Oh, really?  That's pretty much it.  All right, let's get to number one.  Should we just play it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'll just play it.  This is voted the worst guitar solo by Spike.com.  Okay.  The worst.  The worst.  Never mind. 
[01:52:00]  Never mind.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Never mind.  Wow.  This is abominable. 
[01:52:30]  Tonight.  Oh, and then he goes with the cheap applause break because he knew he was barmin'.  That's only good if Christopher Reeve was playing that with his lips.  Yeah, then it's bravo.  Bravo.  That's Fred Durst, everyone.  Remember him?  Fred Durst, yeah.  What is he up to these days?  He was huge for a while.  Not practicing the guitar.  No.  Hell no.  Marcos seems to have an entry.  All right, let's go to Marcos.  Marcos.  Good morning, guys. 
[01:53:00]  Hey, buddy.  Hey, I want to know what number is Marty McFly on?  Now, Marty McFly's guitar solo at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance was fantastic.  Yeah.  It was way ahead of its time.  Of course, the people didn't like it, but their kids will love it.  Yeah.  Yes.  All right, boys.  We should have been a lot more prepared on this one.  We could have had some fun. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, we could have, like, number one and put in something that wasn't number one.  Oh, wow.  We could have put this in.  We could have put in Foundry.  There it is.  We're just too busy wondering when we're going to get fired, Jimmy.  Excuse me.  I like when the guy's voice kicks in and it's not anything like Michael J. Fox's.  This one's the original.  Yeah.  Well, it was ripped off from Marty McFly because his cousin, Marvin Berry, called up Chuck and held the phone up for three seconds, and Chuck was able to get the whole song. 
[01:54:00]  And you watch this crap.  It's not crap.  It's back to the future.  And he spoke so naturally, he went, hey, Chuck, this is your cousin, Marvin Berry.  That's how we all talk.  No, he went, because you're your cousin, Marvin.  Marvin Berry.  And he makes a face like he was all annoyed that Chuck, his cousin, didn't recognize who he was on the phone.  Who he was.  He made that little annoyed face.  He goes, you know that new sound you've been looking for? 
[01:54:30]  And then he holds the phone up, and I guess Chuck heard it, and that was Chuck's career right there.  When he ripped him off?  Yeah.  And then Marty had to run and save his mom from being raped by the guy who would later be waxing the cars at their house.  Yeah.  Oh, that biff.  That rapist.  What a jokester.  Oh, here's your books.  Here's your books are here.  Remember when you tried to rape my wife?  Jesus.  Why would he be at the house?  Never understood that part. 
[01:55:00]  All right, so there you go.  Spike.com with the bad guitar solos.  I think it's, I gotta say, I think it's a lame list.  We can't really make much of that one.  It is stupid.  Because most of those songs, you're not listening to those songs going, oh my God, listen to how bad the guitar is.  You just don't.  Hmm.  Right?  Yeah.  I wish I remember that kid.  You could hate the song, obviously, but to sit there and go, wow, the guitar work on this is awful.  You wouldn't do that.  It might be You Really Got Me.  Did you think about this one? 
[01:55:30]  Because now you got mine.  I got, because it's such a bad guitar lead.  Dude, it stinks.  How does it go?  Do you know?  Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.  It's horrible.  Is it Lola?  Because they were very simple with their songs.  No, no, no.  This one was, um...  God.  All right.  Damn it.  Language.  Son of a...  Maybe tomorrow.  No.  Language, young man.  This is my home.  Now.  Maybe tomorrow.  We could do one more thing really fast.  We've been talking about the youngsters today. 
[01:56:00]  There's a nine-year-old.  Something we wanted to get to, but we got too busy.  Nine-year-old love doctor who wrote a book.  I saw him on, um...  Want to give this a little shot?  Ellen, I believe it was.  Yeah, in between dancing.  Her and that dancing.  Isn't that great?  Very funny broad.  Ugh.  She should just tell her people enough.  I'm not dancing anymore.  I'm funny on my own.  Don't need to do the, uh...  You know, the little show every day for everybody.  Yeah.  I know.  Right? 
[01:56:30]  It was cool for a little while.  I want to see her do the buffalo shuffle wearing her special belt.  You think she has a special belt?  Of course she does.  Yeah?  She straightens out the other one with it.  Yeah.  I'd love to see her doing the mini the moocher dance, wearing that special belt, and then  holding one in each hand of a different color.  I've always been confused by the lesbo, because if they don't like the male part, why do they  have their apparatus look like the male part?  Because that's not what they just like.  It's the man.  It's us.  It's who we are.  But that would remind them of the man. 
[01:57:00]  So why wouldn't the lesbo come up with some new design that has nothing to do with  the male part, but gets the job done?  Because they're stupid brugs.  Making it to a question mark or something.  Special belts with question marks on them.  Haven't you seen those 18-inch arms that they sell?  Right.  That always confused me about the lesbo.  I never understood that.  They're man-haters, but they use something that looks like the man in their lovemaking.  Anthony, in their lovemaking.  I'm thinking of all day and all of the night. 
[01:57:30]  All day and all of the night.  I think...  Can you find that one there, Danny?  Because Anthony's not going to be able to sleep.  Steve, Syracuse.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Have you heard Scorch lately?  Oh, it's after he goes, oh, go, go, go, bling, bling.  Yeah.  Oh, it's horrible.  Yeah.  All day and all of the night.  That's the vocals, though.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to hear the guitar now.  Get that guitar solo.  It's the worst solo you'll ever hear.  It's so awful that I notice how awful it is any time I hear the song. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cue that up.  Cue it up, please.  Are you getting it there, Danny?  Here we go.  It's already here.  No, but he's Johnny on the spot.  What the hell do you want me to do?  You won't be ignored, Dan.  Just make crap up until you're ready.  It's all right, and then whenever we come back.  No thoughts on the lesbo thing?  The lesbo theory I got in?  What about the man, fake man thing?  I'm not talking about the bisexual chicks out there.  The hardcore lesbos who hate men, as far as that goes, but they use a part of the male 
[01:58:30]  to have some enjoyment with their lesbo lovers.  See, I think they like the feeling of that, but not attached to it.  So come up with something that doesn't look like that.  But it's got to, you know.  I mean, you know, insert tab A into slot B.  It can only fit a certain way, you know.  But maybe you can figure something out.  What's it supposed to look like?  A Buick?  I went with a question mark.  A question mark?  Yeah. 
[01:59:00]  With that...  For her pleasure.  The hook?  For her pleasure.  The hook.  For her pleasure.  I don't know.  Maybe we can think about that tomorrow.  I think as long as it's attached to a chick.  All right, I think I got it over here.  All right, let's go, Danny.  All right.  Let's see.  Now, you're sure you're talking about it all day and all night, right?  Because that's what happens.  I'm pretty sure.  We're not sure.  We're going to find out.  I'll know in a second.  Well, tell me if this might be it.  Sucks right from the get-go.  Yeah, yeah.  This is it.  What part?  Listen to the whole leaf. 
[01:59:30]  It sounds like something about Mondo Topless.  Dude, he was like missing everything.  It felt like he was missing everything.  Sounds spastic.  Yeah.  Like a spastic whammy bar or something.  Listen to this part. 
[02:00:00]  Horrible.  I got to tell you, that just shows you that you're a musician because I never picked up  on that until today.  Oh, Lord.  Until today.  I never really listened that closely to the guitar stuff.  All right.  Is that Jeff Goldblum?  Yeah, he was supposed to do our show, but what's up with the Coke bottle glasses?  Not doing radio.  It's always good, though, when people do Picks 11, not realizing that we reach more people.  These dumb publicists.  Because it's more romantic, I guess, to be on TV.  This guy's not reaching anybody with this appearance on Channel 11. 
[02:00:30]  He just looks like a parody of himself while he's talking and pointing at himself and  folding his hands.  We had a great phone call with him, too.  It's too bad.  All right.  Hey, the nine-year-old writes a love advice book, a couple quick clips worth playing.  What does a nine-year-old know about love?  We're going to find out.  A young love doctor.  His name is Alec Grevin.  He is the young author of the book, How to Talk to Girls.  The book started.  She can't believe it.  She's laughing.  It's a nine-year-old boy talking about how to get girls stopped. 
[02:01:00]  I love how they try to keep it innocent.  If a nine-year-old's talking about love, you know what that means, right?  What?  You know.  Jesus, I don't think so.  A little of this.  I think he's talking about probably relationships.  Innocence love?  Yeah.  But he's not stupid.  He knows where the innocent love goes.  Well, they call it puppy love.  I think it's puppy love.  I don't think they're doing that.  I really don't think nine-year-olds are practicing that type of sex. 
[02:01:30]  You know.  Like you're treating the girl like Jake LaMotta treated us.  Thank you.  The book started as a creative writing assignment.  Now it's actually being published by HarperCollins.  That's the real deal, Mike.  Like, once you're this kid, you have to admit, he's got a lot better advice than you do.  Really?  That's funny.  I don't really like the bugs and gross things. 
[02:02:00]  But, um, and most boys don't like it.  See, he's talking about crabs right there.  I'm not stupid.  Bugs and gross things?  Yeah, this guy knows.  No, he means cooties.  Well, yeah.  Girls at that age have what are called cooties.  Yeah, well.  You ever get a cootie shot?  Uh, yeah.  I got a cootie shot when I was a kid.  Is that that dumb, like, or is that a purple?  It was given in many different ways, the cootie shot.  But, uh, always effective against cooties.  If, uh, you were on the playground and a girl touched you, uh, you would go to the, uh, 
[02:02:30]  playground doctor, whoever that would be at the time, and he would give you your cootie shot.  Because you would not want to go back into, uh, school, into the, the school after, uh, recess not having your cootie shot.  And you spread cooties.  Yeah.  Whatever cooties were.  I was too busy.  Girls, girls were, you girls had cooties.  Just the thought of it.  All you girls out there were running around when you were young with cooties.  You didn't even know it. 
[02:03:00]  Ew, you diseased little things.  Y'all got cooties.  Ah, cooties.  Yeah.  Then we stepped it up and gave them herpes and crabs, chlamydia.  Yeah.  The other good ones that there aren't really shots for.  Gonorrhizia.  How do you make up a disease that girls give you when you're, like, friggin' six, seven years old?  Ew, she has cooties.  And how did we know cooties weren't good?  Yeah.  Like, they could have been fantastic. 
[02:03:30]  I wanted cooties on my face.  Yeah.  Sounds like you did.  Yeah.  Sorry, bud.  I was trying, believe me, every minute of the day.  Do you love when your breath smells like cooties?  Oh, wonderful cootie breath.  I used to, in kindergarten, I went up to the shed of this girl's house and we used to show  each other our heinies.  We would just, and that's all we did.  That's like sexting, by the way.  That was us having sex.  Right.  That was the whole texting thing we were talking about.  We used to go in her shed in the back, in the backyard, and I would turn around and 
[02:04:00]  look over my shoulder, and she would turn around and look over her shoulder, and we  would pull our pants down and show each other our heinies.  And I would get a little excited, but you wouldn't know what to do about it, and then  you'd be like, hey, there's some money on the dresser for you.  I'm leaving.  Yeah.  And then you'd go outside and kick the stupid ball around.  Yeah, you didn't know.  No, you just knew it was cool to look at her heinie, even though she had cooties. 
[02:04:30]  Yeah.  And it's just looking, I guess.  Yeah.  And then if I found out that she showed another guy her heinie, I was all, like, mad.  That was cheating.  Yeah, I understand.  She was cheating in the shed.  That was absolutely cheating back then.  My heinie.  Let's get this nine-year-old out of the way so we could go to the other place.  It's just gross things, and most boys don't like things like Hannah Montana and stuff  like that.  Sometimes you get a girl to like you, then she ditches you. 
[02:05:00]  Tip, about 73% of regular girls ditch boys, 98% of pretty girls ditch boys.  Ditch boys, huh?  What does this kid know?  That's what I'm saying.  He's nine.  Sounds like half a fruit.  Wait till I get to the punchline.  This is how we'll end the show.  We got an update on this little effort.  It's going to drive you nuts, Jimmy.  He says, don't be a show-off.  Don't draw too much attention to yourself.  Try to be the smartest boy in class.  Check out what his principal also says about him, Mike. 
[02:05:30]  It was so entertaining, and it was so true.  And I thought, and to come from this little eight-year-old mind, you know, just saying,  this is really how you should talk to girls.  Even if the girl is 46, this is how you should talk to a girl.  They should arrest a kid for writing child pornography.  Yeah, they should arrest her for actually soliciting a date with him.  Yeah, no kidding.  Sounded like it.  46.  Looks like, well, so he writes the book, right, Jimmy?  Mm-hmm.  Yesterday, he signed a $500,000 movie deal. 
[02:06:00]  Hilarious.  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me?  I hope it's directed by Roman Polanski.  That's the world we live in right there.  For what?  What is he going to?  I don't know.  For what?  They're going to turn into a little cute little movie.  They're turning that book into a movie?  Yeah.  On how to, like, pick up girls?  Yeah.  Kids all love that crap. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Little dopes.  Oh, God damn.  We got to go.  Hopefully, we'll be here tomorrow.  We know this much.  We're going over to the other side today.  And Rob Bartlett's going to be there, and we can do some other fun things.  Yeah.  I'll be there in a few.  Why?  What happened?  What happened?  I won't be here tomorrow, so I know you guys will miss me.  Oh, where are you going, Jimmy?  L.A.  I'm leaving a little out.  The Viper Room thing?  Yeah, Friday, Saturday.  I'm with Florentine.  It might be sold out.  Oh, that's very cool, man.  Don't get your hopes up out there. 
[02:07:00]  It's probably sold out.  It's going to be a sellout, Jimmy.  It probably is.  Don't get your hopes up.  That's good.  Good to hear.  All right.  Let's get Jimmy a movie deal.  That's what we need to do.  If this nine-year-old effer could get one, Jimmy could get one, right?  Oh, God.  I hate your cooties.  I'll change my book title.  Yeah.  All right, guys.  Go after yourselves.  Ah, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  I'm glad you said on the other side that that kid is a half a fruit, that nine-year-old 
[02:07:30]  with the love advice.  Yeah, sometimes you can tell, you know?  I don't know.  You know, it's just my opinion from life experience.  He didn't sound, uh, I don't know.  I guess we should just leave the kid alone, right?  Leave him alone.  He's just a kid.  Why are we hating on him?  It's not that we're hating.  It's, it's.  Yeah.  He's talking about something that he probably isn't going to want any part of.  Yeah.  Yeah, his great advice. 
[02:08:00]  Something he's not going to want.  Right?  Uh.  Hi, Yemi.  Hi, guys.  For PalTalk people, I have to tell them no sound or cam.  Oh, well.  Yeah, it seems to be a problem.  I'm going to try sound right now.  Okay.  And it could crash the whole thing.  All right.  When I try cam, it crashes.  Okay.  Let's try sound.  All right.  Sound.  Oh, boy.  This ain't going to be good.  Ah, just crashed.  Uh-huh.  Can't do anything.  Uh-huh.  No sound.  No cam.  Uh-huh.  No PalTalk. 
[02:08:30]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Sorry.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Put it on over here.  Yeah, put it on over there.  Some crap.  Shit.  I can say shit.  Anthony, we have some fine stuff to play for the people today.  Mm-hmm.  We got another tasing video.  We got, uh...  Uh, which are, uh, when I do, uh, look at videos online at night, I do that every, uh, night.  I pretty much pop them on.  Taisings, some of, amongst some of my favorite videos ever.  Especially the long-form screaming ones. 
[02:09:00]  Uh, the people that were very uncooperative right up until those barbs that went into them  and gave them, uh, about 10,000, uh, volts or so.  It's hysterical!  And then you hear, all right, all right, all right, all right, stop, stop, stop, stop  it, stop it, stop it, stop it!  Like, wait a minute.  Before, you were fighting.  You wouldn't let me put my arms behind, uh, your arms behind, uh, your back.  You always see me.  It's like, put your arms behind, put your arms, put your arms behind your back. 
[02:09:30]  And they clutch their chest.  They're like, no, I'm, I'm fucking rolling up in a ball.  You are not gonna handcuff me.  I will tase you.  Nope.  I don't care.  I am not gonna...  Here's my arms!  Holy shit!  Don't ever do that again!  Oh my God!  Don't ever do it again, please!  God, Jesus!  Instant compliance.  It's amazing.  Just like those videos you were talking about last night, uh, yesterday.  Uh, today, sorry.  Sometimes I feel like...  Yeah, I never know what the hell day it is.  Yeah.  No, when you were talking about, uh, the convenience store robberies, and they're all 
[02:10:00]  tough and stuff, and next thing you know...  All tough, gangsta.  The guy behind the counter has a sawed-off shotgun or a machete or something, and it's a whole  different story.  Pulls it out.  There's one like that where the guy, uh, it's an oldie but goodie, where the guy comes in,  uh, with a shotgun, uh, robs the store.  He puts the shotgun on the counter while the guy is giving him the money.  Mm-hmm.  And then, in the split second between the time the guy gave him the money and the robber  goes to put it in his pocket, the guy behind the counter grabs the guy's shotgun and turns 
[02:10:30]  it around on him, and you... this guy runs out the door so damn fast.  The only problem is he comes back.  He does.  Yeah, and the guy, the store owner who now had the shotgun, put himself in a bad position.  He put himself, like, in a blind spot and in a corner, and then it was out of range  of the camera.  He should have moved in front of the door and just stood there.  Right.  You know, so if the guy comes back, you get to blast him right back through the door. 
[02:11:00]  What happened when the guy came back?  Uh, didn't see on the camera.  It went off camera.  Like, uh, the, the, uh, robber went over the counter and went to him, and then eventually  you see him running out the door again, but I don't know what transpired in the corner.  Uh, without the gun.  Yeah.  So he probably went back to get it because his fingerprints were all over it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well.  There, there are some real dummies.  There was another one.  A couple of guys were robbing a store and, um, and, uh, one guy is leaving and the other  guy decided, uh, to ask the girl behind the counter if she wanted to go out with him. 
[02:11:30]  It's like, you're, you're fine.  You're like, you know, you want to go out with me or something?  She was like, no.  Just robbed me.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  It's such an awkward relationship.  It's great.  But then this, this site was also full of like real gross things.  All it shows is a blank screen with, um, dripping blood.  It says extremely graphic and I don't click on those.  Yeah.  Don't click on those.  And the one you were talking about with those guys that kind of stabbed that guy, bashed his 
[02:12:00]  face in.  Blood gutted.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I'm sorry.  That's different.  That's different.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Stop.  That was up there.  I'm not, I'm not, I'm not looking at those at all.  You should watch that for a minute.  No, I can't.  No.  I cannot watch those.  The furthest I've gotten, I can watch Iraq, Iraqi war footage, but I can't watch the Americans  getting sniped.  Sure.  Like when it shows American gets sniped or, um, improvised explosive device blows up  a Humvee.  I can't watch that. 
[02:12:30]  When they show, uh, insurgents getting, uh, blown to pieces, I'm all over it.  Can't get enough.  Yeah.  Why is that?  Isn't it supposed to be their human?  Uh, it's the same thing.  Because there's no familiarity.  Cause it's like the same thing you said about it's easy to watch people dying, uh, far away.  Yeah.  There's no real familiar familiarity.  Yeah.  Their cars look different.  The clothes they're wearing different.  Their skin color looks different.  Everything about them is different.  So it makes it easier, I guess. 
[02:13:00]  And you kind of know that like the, the, the, if you watch an American getting killed in  one of these videos that, you know, there's a family there that also speaks English, might  live in your town.  Right.  And then over there, uh, you really don't look at them as family people, even though they  most likely are.  Even the insurgents probably go home and, you know, do whatever they do.  Oh, she's a good special on a HBO on demand.  It might be off now, but it was about a, over in, um, Israel, there was a very big case 
[02:13:30]  of a 17 year old suicide bomber, a girl, went into a supermarket and the only person she  killed was a 17 year old Israeli girl.  And when you look at their photos side by side, they looked very similar.  It's like, these are two girls that could have been friends.  They were pretty, you know, it's the same region.  And so there was this thing about the Jewish girl's mother wanted to confront the Palestinian  girl's mother, but it's very dangerous in Gaza Strip for her to go there.  So, uh, the whole thing is them going back and forth where she's going to meet her. 
[02:14:00]  The mother agrees finally to meet with her.  And, um, I don't want to give the whole.  She blew her up.  Yes, she shot her.  She dropped a bomb on him.  But when you, when you listen to the mother of the palace, cause I expected to hate the  Palestinian girl's mother.  But when you listen to her talk about, Hey, look, you're coming from a place of the oppressor  and I'm coming from like, we're looking at it as people who are being oppressed.  Uh, I didn't agree with the suicide bomber, but you don't hate the Palestinian mother like 
[02:14:30]  you think you will.  You do kind of understand where she's coming from, even though you don't agree with the  point.  You know what I'm saying?  It was much harder for me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  To see this mother fight back.  Like, cause the Jewish mother's like, well, did you know that your daughter was going to  do that?  She's like, no, of course I didn't.  But then the Jewish mother was saying, well, you got to say it was wrong that she did it.  It was just really interesting if anybody saw that.  But I found myself not siding as harshly against her as I thought I would.  Wow.  Yeah.  I'm going to have to see that.  You'll never let that out.  Yeah.  That's one of those things you got to see. 
[02:15:00]  If you describe it, it's like, no, I still hate her.  No, not boring along, but I'm just like, no, I still probably hate her.  But what side is that on?  I was on HBO's On Demand.  It's probably off now.  I forget what it was called.  Okay.  I would have named it the Jewish girl who got blown up by the Palestinian girl.  And then the moms.  You call it that, but yeah, it's too long of a title.  Hey, we got a Ron and Fez spy report from Stunt Brain, who stays over at the other joint  when we leave.  Subject, big, in capital letters, meeting in conference room.  The K-Rock muckity mucks, that would be the suits, all went into the conference room and 
[02:15:30]  just closed the door very, very quietly.  Uh-oh.  There are rumors of many old rock jocks coming back to the station and other day parts.  News as it breaks.  Yeah, there's something going on over there.  I'm starting to think that maybe we'll be part of whatever the fuck they decide to do  next.  I am?  Yeah, I'm going to try to be an optimist for once.  I am.  Hey, Planet in Peril.  CNN's doing this thing.  Planet in Peril. 
[02:16:00]  Peril.  And I guess Texas is getting like two inches of snow, so where's the peril?  And what's the problem?  What's the problem?  By the way, and I got the whole global warming thing figured out, and I don't know why no  one...  You did it?  I don't know why no one has come to me for the real answer.  Got it all figured out?  You want to know my answer?  It's very simple.  Please, I'd love to hear it.  Nothing has changed.  Whatsoever.  Since when?  Since...  Since the beginning of time?  Nah, recorded history will go in.  All right.  Nothing has changed.  Here's the problem. 
[02:16:30]  What?  The scientists never figured out our clock right.  Think?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  So everything has shifted a little bit.  Thank you.  But they did.  Nope.  They did not.  They know on like a planetary scale where the Earth is at any given moment.  Like right now is what, December 11th, 10th, somewhere around there?  I bet you it's really like October.  You think so?  Over so much time we've lost or gained or something. 
[02:17:00]  You know, but they know where we are in space relative to the sun.  How do you know?  Who's been up there to really look at it?  Because the Earth is tilted on its axis.  So we know when the solstice comes around that that is the pinnacle of where the sun is  hitting.  There was a story today.  They're still adjusting the clock.  Tropic of Cancer or the equator.  Nope.  Nope.  Or the Tropic of Capricorn.  Bullshit.  Thank you, Jimmy. 
[02:17:30]  Those are your sun lines.  Nope.  During any, you know?  What does that mean?  Who figured that out?  And who decided that's what it's going to be?  You know that there was a story today that they have to add a second onto this year because  they don't have the clock figured out still?  Onto the big atomic clock.  Yeah.  They're adding a second at the end of this year to make up for it.  Well, they think they are.  But I'm telling you, the whole global warming thing, it's just a shift happened.  That's all.  Because remember, people go, oh, I remember when it was colder on Halloween when I was 
[02:18:00]  growing up.  So you're saying if we just change the calendar to like, right now is July, people would be  like...  Well, that'd be a little crazy.  Now you're insane.  No, no, I'm going the extreme, just to make a point.  Yeah.  Like, all right, we change the calendar, we flip everything forward, and today is the  4th of July.  Yeah.  It would be the oddest thing because we'd be like, oh my God, it's snowing on the 4th  of July.  There you go.  It's no different than that.  There you go.  I think they're in cahoots together, too.  Yeah. 
[02:18:30]  Security.  Security.  Remove Opie from the building, I believe he's lost.  Yeah, well, I got someone backing me up, and I don't need any of that dumb knowledge  you have.  I just have to go with a little hunch every once in a while.  I got a hunch.  The clock's wrong.  You got a hunch, do you?  I got a hunch that the clock's wrong.  Rob on Long Island.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Yeah, Opie's not too far off.  Thank you.  A few thousand years ago, back in the Roman and Greek times, before they accounted for daylight  savings and leap years and stuff, all these little extra seconds. 
[02:19:00]  And days and stuff would always add on to where they literally had to add two months  to their calendar, July and August, I believe, because it started just snowing and had crazy  climate temperatures around spring and summer.  So they had to add an extra two months just to try to balance things out.  What year was this?  There you go.  So, you know, you can look it up.  Yeah, I'm with you, Rob.  See?  Me and you, buddy.  We go with our hunches.  We don't need dumb knowledge.  We don't have to look it up in books.  The clocks can't be that off, though. 
[02:19:30]  So, like, we still see the results physically.  How do we know?  Of the ice caps that are different.  And try to explain it.  They don't get much bigger.  I didn't like that explanation.  You didn't like that explanation?  Nope.  I kind of like it because...  And how many people have actually seen the ice caps?  I don't know what they look like 20 years ago.  We know where we are in space relative to the sun.  That dictates our months and our seasons.  How about Mr. Spaceman just moved everything over a little bit?  What's who's Mr. Spaceman?  I don't know who he is. 
[02:20:00]  But we know because we have to know.  We have to know for satellites, for launching things, for going to other planets.  So, we absolutely know.  What do you really know?  There was a time we thought the Earth was flat and that was the law.  We know when we're in the exact spot around the sun that we were the year before.  Which makes it the same day.  Alright, let's go back in time.  Someone said, we know the Earth is flat.  Well, they were real stupid.  How do you know?  We're not real stupid. 
[02:20:30]  We're not real stupid.  We've learned that.  The Earth is not flat.  But there's other stuff we haven't learned.  Like we don't have the clock right.  No, I think we got that down.  Yeah, and then why is it a lot warmer around Christmas?  And the clock being right is more the Earth spinning on its axis than rotating around the sun.  There is a variation of the Earth spinning day to night.  How do we know the Earth's spinning?  How do we know the Earth's spinning?  Yeah.  It gets dark. 
[02:21:00]  And then it gets light again.  Maybe it's the sun spinning.  Now you're talking like old school.  Now you're talking back in the day.  I'm going back in the way old day.  I'm going like Galileo.  The sun.  Like how do we know this shit?  The Earth is at the center of everything.  It rests on a tortoise's back.  Proving my point, by the way.  Thank you.  We believed that.  Yes, we did.  Like it was law?  Yeah.  Oh, is that what that?  Wait, where is that?  What does that mean?  Because that's from a Stephen King book.  What exactly is he referencing?  They really thought that.  They really thought that the Earth was at the center of the universe and it rested on a tortoise's back. 
[02:21:30]  And for some reason, a tortoise, a giant tortoise.  What?  Who would think that shit?  That drivel.  And the second you came up with some scientific thing where it was actually a good theory and it had some, not proof, but it had some good dialogue to back it up with.  They'd, you know, pull out your innards and feed them to pigs and then set you afire. 
[02:22:00]  I actually know, I do know why they thought that.  It was a bizarre thing because Stonehenge, you look at Stonehenge and someone said, that looks like giant pieces of turtle shit.  That's all I got.  It wasn't not much.  Let's go to Alaska.  We don't get a call from Alaska too often.  So, Dan, what's going on?  Not much, you guys.  All right.  Of course nothing much.  You're in Alaska.  Talking about where the extra two months of the calendar come from, I actually learned this from my kid. 
[02:22:30]  Believe it or not, they do learn something at school.  So, July and August was added by the Roman Caesars.  July was for Julius Caesar and August was for Augustus Caesar.  Yes.  Yes.  So, you can't just add two months to the calendar, Ant, without anyone noticing.  I'm telling you.  Well, apparently they used to.  They were too busy getting drunk and stoned and having their orgies for anybody else to really pay too much attention to anything anyways.  But they didn't have it down back then.  And why in the year 2008 are we adding a second onto this year? 
[02:23:00]  Maybe that whole second thing has been happening all the time and now it's moved everything forward a little bit.  You've got to hate it when that happens.  That's right.  It's called To Die in Jerusalem, Jimmy.  HBO special.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Brian in Illinois.  Brian.  Yeah.  Hey.  I was just wanting to say that, you know, the Earth rotates on a texas, right?  Yeah.  The axis rotates also.  So, basically, eventually the North Pole will become the South Pole. 
[02:23:30]  What?  You're saying that we're actually turning over as a planet?  Yes.  I think we've been the same weird degrees for quite some time.  There's a bit of a wobble.  I think that's what he's trying to say.  But we're not flipping over.  Sorry.  I can't go with you on that one.  What does the wobble mean?  Not very fast.  It's nothing.  There's always just been a bit of a wobble.  It's a natural, you know, nothing's perfect kind of a thing.  And our planet spins around on its axis and the axis is tilted. 
[02:24:00]  So, it's not this perfect, you know, little spinny thing.  But wouldn't it be perfect that just how we look at it makes it not perfect?  Wouldn't it be perfect if you looked at it like...  Well, relative to the solar system that we're in and the sun, you know...  Do you know what I was going to say?  Yeah, yeah.  Like, it's in space and since space is endless, if you look at it one way, then it is going  straight up and down.  And the solar system is bent the wrong way. 
[02:24:30]  But...  Yeah.  I'm punching out.  All right, well...  It is really odd when you get into that whole spacey shit.  I hate thinking about space.  It just goes on and on forever and ever and ever.  Thomas Overbeck from Dallas, the tortoise's back theory was actually proposed by Ted the  astronomer, owner of Ted's Telescope Palace.  It was never Ted's Telescope Palace, you cluck.  It was Ted's space-viewing emporium.  Space-viewing emporium? 
[02:25:00]  Yes.  I was pushing the turtles back theory because I had a bunch of hats that looked like turtle  backs and I had to sell them.  I would call them the universe hats.  Nobody bought one.  Oh, I was going to ask how they sell.  Not too well, Anthony.  I tried to sell them as fancy soup bowls.  I heard in the first phase of trying to sell them, you didn't remove the turtle, which  was a little awkward. 
[02:25:30]  People walking around with just turtles on their head.  Yes!  And the turtles will claw your scalp and they go niff-niff into your scalp and it hurts  with their little turtle beaks.  They do tend to snap.  And their duty runs right down the back of your neck.  I was on a date one time showing my fancy hat off and the girl kissed my neck and said,  Theodore, your neck smells like turtle feces.  I was frightfully embarrassed.  Oh, God damn. 
[02:26:00]  Frightfully.  Yes.  Ted is such an ass.  No, I was correct.  The turtle made a doody down my neck.  And I always tuck in my shirts so it began to collect and pile up.  Oh, God damn.  That was one nervous turtle.  Yeah, apparently.  Yeah, I see.  Riding around in your head with his little beak.  Yes!  He would try to crawl off and I'd punch him.  You know, I wasn't raised in prehistoric days, like a lot of people say, but I certainly 
[02:26:30]  do remember a lot more reptiles and amphibians running around Long Island when I was growing  up.  As a kid, I used to live in Central Islip and then East Islip.  And it was by Hexer Park.  And you used to be able to go off the side of the highway.  And there was just this huge expanse of woods where there were ferns growing.  Sure.  Ferns and little ponds that you'd go to and catch salamanders, little amphibians and frogs 
[02:27:00]  all over and turtles.  It was like this weird little ecosystem that just gone.  Gone.  That's just because they started building a lot of houses.  Yeah, they built a lot of shit is what it is, definitely.  But the scientists are trying to figure out why the frogs are disappearing.  Look it up.  Same thing.  I think it's the same thing.  In general, they're saying something's going on with the frogs.  They're disappearing.  They're disappearing. 
[02:27:30]  Frogs need a certain environment to live in.  And I don't think housing developments are conducive to their survival.  I don't even think they're taking that into consideration and they're still saying, what  is going on with the frogs?  It's saying the same thing with the bees.  I think the frogs are the aliens and they're just going back home.  Bees are disappearing.  Frogs are queer.  Frogs are aliens.  Frogs and cats are definitely aliens.  No.  Yeah, because you guys are like, you guys look at aliens like they're supposed to kind 
[02:28:00]  of look more human.  They're walking among us.  They're cats.  Cats look like they belong here on this planet.  Fuck no, they don't.  Yeah, they do.  They got arms and legs.  You were a cat owner.  Head, teeth, noses.  You were a cat owner.  Those things are not.  They're not.  If it was smart enough to be a fucking alien and get here, I could tell it to stop clawing  my fucking couch and I'd be able to have a cat.  I don't know what they do when you're sleeping at night.  They claw your shit up is what they do.  What does that mean?  And they lay on your chest and steal your breath. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, but they burn their own shit in a box.  Did someone out there get that joke?  Yes.  I'm with you on that one.  Mooney in Texas where it snowed a couple inches in, I think, the Houston area.  Mooney, what's up?  Morning, Opie.  Morning, Anthony.  Morning, Jim.  Morning, Mooney.  Opie, you're completely correct about adding time.  Thank you.  When they had in July and August, they had to add 10 days to account for leap year.  There you go. 
[02:29:00]  You can't just add 10 days.  They did.  They don't have it figured out.  There's a shift going on.  We're in December, but this was like mid-October when we were growing up.  We lost two months in our lifetime somehow.  Yeah, but 365 days later, it's still different, and the caps have melted.  I think that's the big problem.  Because I've actually, I went to the polar ice caps many times as a boy.  Oh, did you?  Did you, Jimmy?  Yes.  My father would shape it.  He certainly did.  And we fished for polar bears.  They're cunts.  You hear our buddy there from, that nature dude guy. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, yeah, Bear Grylls.  Bear Grylls got injured right after, yeah, he left our show.  Well, he apparently went down to Antarctica.  He was promoting that on our show.  And fell and fucked up his shoulder.  How bad is he?  Well, it was bad enough where they had to fly him back to jolly old England.  I was going to say, to his nice five-star hotel.  Yeah.  You know something, though?  You got to give it to him. 
[02:30:00]  There ain't no five-star hotels down in Antarctica.  We see what happens now when he fucking doesn't have a big hotel.  Yeah, when he doesn't have a hotel, he's got to leave immediately.  A five-star igloo.  He went back to England where they were going to assess how bad his shoulder was.  Pretty bad, though, huh?  So they're saying, but perhaps he needed a little warmth.  If I was one of these guys that had one of these shows where your whole credibility is based on how you handle survival in the wilderness,  and you can't take the wilderness, I'd come up with a story like, 
[02:30:30]  Ow, I hurt my arm.  I have to fly back.  I'm really fucking cold.  That's probably what happened.  That's what happened.  Look, I didn't understand the cold of Antarctica.  I thought, you know, when the heat goes out in your house and it gets cold, you get an extra blanket,  that Antarctica cold, that is beyond the realm of cold.  Of understanding.  That's, it will kill you cold in no time.  Why the fuck do you want to go there? 
[02:31:00]  I don't know.  Well, Godspeed there.  Hey, speaking of updates, because we do have the Man vs. Wild update, we were talking to Dana White, and I had shit to do last night, and I'm so pissed I couldn't watch that UFC thing, and I said I was going to watch it, the thing he did for the troops.  Yes, with Josh Acosta.  Did you hear Mars sent out a great email overnight?  These two fights were ridiculous.  One guy broke his arm, and one guy broke his leg, right?  Wow.  Where's Mars?  Because how he described it on the email, I'm like, fuck, why didn't I watch this last night? 
[02:31:30]  I know.  They're probably fighting for free, these guys, too.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, Mars?  What's up, fellas?  So, quickly, what happened with the fights last night?  Well, one guy, I don't know, he has some balls, he refused to tap, and the guy just kept going, and just snapped it.  Snap what?  Even when he snapped the, I think around the elbow area.  He wouldn't tap even after he snapped it?  And even after he snapped it, the dude just had this look, a daze, like, confused, and didn't say a word. 
[02:32:00]  Didn't say one word.  So then what did they do?  They stopped it.  Oh, they finally stopped it at that point?  Tough motherfuckers.  And you've got to see the other one where you can see it on UFC.com.  Yeah.  The dude kicks him, and the other guy checks it, and you'll see.  Wow.  What do you mean by check it?  That's like blocking it?  Yeah, you block it.  With your leg?  Yes.  You're blocking a kick with your leg?  Right.  And the guy that's kicking gets the worst of it.  Oh, really?  If you do it right.  Yes.  I see this stuff, I can still watch. 
[02:32:30]  What, legs?  Yeah, I can watch.  The Joe Montana thing, all that.  It was Joe, right?  Yeah.  Joe Rogan.  No, Theismann.  Thank you.  Theismann.  Theismann.  I could still watch that stuff.  Yeah, we got the Rogan call.  Dude, that's what it's leading to here.  But I want to see the video.  Loading.  Loading.  Everyone's checking it out now.  Come on, man.  Loading.  Loading.  Buffering.  Buffering.  There were a lot of buffers.  Yeah, there were a lot of buffers.  All right.  All right.  There we go. 
[02:33:00]  He's going up to the...  All right.  It's one of those videos.  Yeah.  Where, like, you can't just skip to it.  Like, you have to wait for the whole thing to load.  To build.  What?  So how long is this fight?  It's only up to the second round.  First minute of the second round.  So is it going to be a while, Danny?  Yeah.  I just got to...  All right.  Once the video was...  Why don't we get the call from...  Let's have that shit buffer.  Our old pal, Joe Rogan, who's too busy to do our show these days, unfortunately.  We love the guy.  This is how he called the broken leg.  Dale showing a lot of head movement.  Eats a nice kick.  Oh. 
[02:33:30]  Roy fell down.  Oh, he's last broken.  He's last broken.  Oh, stop, stop, stop.  It's going to be stopped.  Stop the fight.  Stop the fight.  Stop the fight.  Fight is all over.  Corey Hill has suffered a broken leg.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  The doctors are in quickly.  Oh, man.  It's good to know the doctors are in quickly, but what can they really do at that moment? 
[02:34:00]  Drag them out of the...  They don't even do it yet.  Who's yelling, stop the fight?  I was wrong with those guys.  They saw it.  They were probably worried the ref didn't see it.  It's like, oh, stop the fight.  Don't let the guy twist it off.  Wow.  Wow.  I got to see this now.  Stretch Armstrong leg where you can just, like, pull it.  Oh, wow.  Oh, those are so bad.  They all hang in foot.  I got to see this now.  Now I'm going to be all cringy when I watch it.  Gives me the hee-bum-jee-bums.  B-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b-b. 
[02:34:30]  So you like the fights, Mars?  Oh, absolutely.  Great fights.  Good fights.  All of them.  Even the main event was a shocker.  It was nasty.  Yeah, cool.  Another thing I noticed last night with my video perusing online.  Remember when wrestling was really at its peak?  A lot of that backyard wrestling was going on?  Sure.  Now that mixed martial arts is so popular, Opie, this seems to be the thing to do.  Backyard.  Is go in your backyard and beat the piss out of each other in front of your friends and 
[02:35:00]  neighbors for nothing.  It's a fight club.  And they, yeah.  Pretty much fight club in the open.  They kick each other in the face.  They do the elbow fucking when they get the guy on the ground.  And this is now something people are doing in their backyards.  Right.  What does this look like a video game?  It's a little pixelated.  Looks like an old Sega system game.  They blew up the low quality video. 
[02:35:30]  All right.  Is it coming up here, Danny?  Yeah.  All right.  I know this is radio.  We understand, but.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Stop the fight.  Stop the fight.  I didn't see it.  Look.  Look at his leg.  Ow.  Ow, ow, ow.  That's like breaking a board up against a house.  He kicks with his right leg.  His shin becomes his knee.  Look at it.  Watch.  Look at it.  Yeah.  In the back.  We have stopped on the face frame.  His right leg is back.  And it looks like a piece of flesh.  Not even that. 
[02:36:00]  His whole ankle and foot were turned around.  It was on the ground.  The middle of his shin became his knee.  Hey, Danny.  That's where it bent.  And also, that's why Rogan was yelling.  Stop the fight.  Because the other guy didn't realize his leg was broken.  No, he went right after him.  Wow.  He jumped on him.  Danny.  Can we get Rogan on the phone?  Is Steve around today?  Get Rogan on the phone.  They have a better angle.  A closer shot and a better angle.  He has to fast forward it a little bit.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, yeah.  A better shot?  Oh, that's all I need to say.  Oh, that looks hot.  This is the better shot. 
[02:36:30]  And we'll tell you where this is.  God damn.  Most people know where to find this.  God.  Oh, that is just...  It looks...  Why are they kicking each other?  Yeah, that's part of the thing.  I think they kick each other.  But this is not like boxing.  It's not like boxing.  Dude, that kick...  Fuck.  Amazing.  His leg just...  Your bone is really what supports your leg.  Oh!  Oh!  Fucking A to watch that.  Wow.  It's brutal. 
[02:37:00]  Wow.  That's way clearer.  Brutal.  Wow.  Wow.  That's two...  Dude, that is two pretty good-sized bones in that part of your leg.  Wow.  Wow.  Can we get it?  What are we doing?  Better angle.  Broke.  I mean, I can't even imagine what's going through your mind right now.  Well, to be honest with you, me and Corey, we cut weight together.  We've been talking the whole time, man.  And Corey's an awesome dude. 
[02:37:30]  And I wanted to beat him with every bit of my heart.  But I don't want to see him like this, man.  Well, this is just an unfortunate freak accident.  Take a look at the big screen that we're going to show to you right now.  Unfortunate, but let's show you again.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Keep right here.  And...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Listen to the audience.  It looks like...  How about a big round of applause for Corey Hill, ladies and gentlemen. 
[02:38:00]  When he kicks.  Is he still on the ground as they're interviewing this guy?  Holy shit.  When he kicks, it looks like a sock that's holding something solid.  Yeah.  We look forward to seeing you again as well.  Can we see that one again, Angle?  Hey, Joe, real quick.  I've been a pain to Marcus Davis' butt for like five years now.  Oh, lovers.  I owe this win to him.  I've been training a lot of extreme control.  All right.  No one cares.  I want to see the broken leg.  I just fucking snapped his leg.  No one cares.  You're right.  I love you.  Thank you to Corey for not drinking milk.  Oh, man. 
[02:38:30]  Dale's showing a lot of head movement.  I can't even.  I can't even look at it.  Look at it.  It's twisted around.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck.  Get out of here.  He is in fucking pain, man.  That's got to end his career.  Dude, look at that right there.  Trust me, Jimmy.  We see it.  God.  Where do the people go? 
[02:39:00]  I could beat him at that point.  Most people know.  Yeah.  Do you know something?  He could probably still kick your ass.  It looks like an ostrich leg.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It goes backwards.  It's bent the wrong way.  Where do they go?  That's on UFC.com.  It's like the first.  When they load the homepage, there's a whole bunch of videos they can choose from.  It's the first one.  Dana White promised us a good one yesterday, and he certainly delivered once again.  Quick break.  Where's Rob Bartlett?  Is he coming in?  Yeah, I think so.  All right.  I want to see the other one, too.  The arm?  Who worked her arm?  Yeah, we'll find out after the break.  I'm scared.  We've got to go find that, Jimmy.  Who's hurt, Opie?  We've got to find that, Jimmy. 
[02:39:30]  I'm frightened.  And we've got the latest taser video.  That's how we started this break.  We'll hopefully get to that next, too.  Opie and Anthony.  But with real shows.  Yeah.  I hear you.  What are you looking for?  Hi, it's the Opie and Anthony show.  We're back from our little bathroom break. 
[02:40:00]  We're doing pajama graph.  Oh.  It's a commercial.  Yeah, my headphones were, like, tangled around my chair.  Oh, yeah, for Christmas, Anthony.  Yeah.  We talk about this every year.  They got the pajama graph.  Yep.  I've actually sent this product, and the result's very, very good.  Mommy loved her lingerie.  You didn't get your mother lingerie, did you?  Yeah, why not?  Just spice things up for her.  I would think the lingerie is for the girlfriend, but then there's also great comfy pajamas for, like, your mom. 
[02:40:30]  Because you don't want to get your mom something sexy.  It's a little weird.  I got my mom a nice tee back.  Jesus Christ.  Pajama graph's got that.  Yeah.  And not only that, it comes in this beautiful hat box.  You're going to love that.  A lavender scented sachet.  And then the Do Not Disturb sign.  My mom loved the Do Not Disturb sign, by the way.  What?  I don't know. 
[02:41:00]  That's more for the girlfriend.  I don't know what my mom's doing in there, but she loves the Do Not Disturb sign.  Oh, right.  Maybe she just likes, you know, sleeping and stuff and not.  No, I think she likes cock.  Oh.  Oh, no.  See, these have to be shipped off to the sponsor.  You know what?  Watch what the boys do in post, as they like to call it.  They also have what, Ant?  Gift cards?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they got the gift cards.  You can get all this online.

[02:42:30]  You've seen the dyke scene?  Holy shit.  What?  Monday, Monday.  Oh, Monday?  You've seen the dyke scene, that pictures?  Yeah, we're getting this penthouse pet in on Monday.  Look at page 103.  103?  How do you find pages in porno magazines?  I don't know.  It's always tough.  103?  Look for page 103, and look at that.  Hold on.  Look how clean her asshole is. 
[02:43:00]  It's so hot.  And would you?  Scrum-diddly-ish-ous.  Would you?  Oh, yeah, of course you do.  You'll do that in a second.  Yeah, but she might have had some of that asshole bleaching.  Yeah?  It still might stink like a garbage bag.  Are they bleaching on her asshole?  I prefer a darker asshole, to be honest.  Yeah, but they bleach them out, Jimmy.  The blonde looks like Clarissa explains it all.  Doesn't she, a little bit?  Yeah.  The penthouse pet that's coming in, pet of the year, has a fucking really meaty vag. 
[02:43:30]  She's really sexy, man.  Rob Bartlett.  Rob, we're looking at a penthouse pet's asshole.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  It's another great show.  Yeah.  You want to partake in the penthouse pet asshole conversation we're having right now?  Gee, where else could you do something like that?  Ooh, I thought her father's proud.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Which one?  What page are we on?  Well, she's getting a mouthful right there. 
[02:44:00]  I've moved on to some other pages.  I'm looking at the little, there's some licking action going on on page 136 or something like that.  Yeah, but go to page 81.  It looks like her pussy, it looks like sushi going awry.  Oh, really?  Yeah, look.  I don't like that.  There's something going on there.  What do they sell on the back of these these days?  That's a California roll.  Sashimi.  What's your favorite page, Rob? 
[02:44:30]  Uh, where are the articles?  Yeah, the story on what?  Brett Favre?  What's wrong with you?  How can we all look at a penthouse cynically?  I don't get how there's a cynicism with these fucking...  Where was the cynicism?  Just the, I don't know.  Do you think these girls really like each other or are they just putting it on for the camera?  Yeah, we've...  I know you're making a joke.  The sad part is they just do it for the camera.  We've seen this exact thing in studio.  They make it all silly.  You know, there's Vanessa Williams... 
[02:45:00]  We don't want our lesbians to be silly.  We want them to be...  Wow, this one looks like Kate Hudson.  You know those Vanessa Williams pictures were almost 25 years ago?  Who?  Wow.  Remember the Vanessa Williams picture?  The pen of the year, page 34, is great.  With the big pelt that she had, she was sporting.  Awesome.  Nice sniper rifles on page 64.  Would you?  How do you find rifles in a penthouse?  I wouldn't...  I don't know.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, there's some hot lesbians.  There's some nice rifles, though.  Brennan Lindsay.  I think I own that one. 
[02:45:30]  Cool party.  And it gets the same...  These are lovely.  Yeah, I got two of these rifles I own.  Yeah, where are we looking at rifles?  I own this one.  In Penthouse, page 64.  Yeah.  Here's a hot one where the one girl is spinning.  It's right before the page where...  Right after the page where the girl is blowing a gentleman wearing a powdered wig.  Why?  Samuel Adams kind of a...  Yeah, yeah.  Why?  Something like that.  There's one here where the girl is spitting into the girl's pussy.  What's fucking magazine here with? 
[02:46:00]  Look at the fake spit.  It's 60-something.  Look at the fake spit on page 135.  135 fake spit?  Are you following along at home, kid?  Yeah.  Pull out your workbooks.  We don't do this for them.  We do this for ourselves.  135 fake spit.  Sex games.  130 what?  No sense.  135.  I don't see the spit.  Where?  Page 120.  Page 135.  That's this one.  What do you have?  I have this issue. 
[02:46:30]  I have pet of the year issue.  Oh, you dummy.  Because I went to page 34 and it's a snowmobile.  It looks fun to ride also.  That's a pet of the year.  I'm not complaining with my 135 though in my magazine.  It's a good shot.  Yeah, that was a good shot.  Rubbing her spit.  Look at Jimmy's got his hand down his pants now.  It's a taint itch.  Oh, do you?  Wait, these looks like, these looks like, Jesus.  They look like twins.  And the one twin is rubbing the clitoris through the panties of the other twin. 
[02:47:00]  Jimmy, when you have a taint itch, where is the line where if you smelled your finger,  it would smell like balls or it would smell like ass?  Usually it's a complete mix anywhere from the belly button to the middle of my spine.  Because, you know, you'd think the taint, it would either smell like balls if it's close there,  or asshole, but there's got to be some kind of a neutral zone.  My asshole.  A demilitarized zone, a 38th parallel of your taint. 
[02:47:30]  My asshole smells only like asshole, and it's very clean.  I very rarely have a, like last night, I took a shit and then I hopped in the shower,  but I hadn't, the log was still in there somewhere.  Oh boy.  So as I was soaping out my asshole, I could still, my finger, no, I could, yeah,  it was still like mushed up shit in my ass way up there, but that's very rare for me.  Normally my ass has no smell to it.  Right.  I don't think it does.  Well, congratulations.  It's an unscented.  It really is, yeah.  Unscented version, yeah.  For those people with allergies. 
[02:48:00]  Mine is tropical mist.  Anybody need a drink?  Yeah.  Will you get up and leave?  By the way, everyone throw their porno in the middle of the room.  I'm very excited about the impending marriage.  I haven't gotten the invitation yet.  Oh boy.  You know what?  Oh boy.  You should have got the invite.  I, I, I, I gotta be honest.  Another person that fell to the wayside.  Look at his finger.  I should have got the invite to you.  That's what I'm saying.  I'll tell you what happened.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  He's, uh.  I'm like Luke Costello here.  I started getting tired at the end of like inviting people and, and then like, I should  have went through my, uh, my phone list one last time and I just didn't feel like it.  So there's a bunch of people that should have got invited that didn't.  You're one of those people.  Yeah.  It's just, you know, I'm not even kidding.  I, I just got lazy at the end.  Your fucking pal who used to promote you.  I got lazy.  I'm being honest.  Wearing a Opie Anthony t-shirt on MSNBC.  I know.  Interrupting weather reports.  Yep.  There's a, there's probably 10 people I realized I should have invited and I just didn't feel 
[02:49:00]  like dealing with that anymore.  The man who almost died on August 25th.  Yeah.  We got to talk about that.  You know what pulled me through?  You know what pulled me through?  Huh?  Was hoping that I was going to get to go to your fucking wedding.  Yeah.  Yes.  We thought you checked out.  We got really scared.  I thought I checked out.  A, I apologize for not inviting you to the wedding and I know you're making jokes, but  you should have been there.  Like I would have gone.  I don't care.  As long as, as long as the invite, as long as you know that I was thinking about you.  No, I know.  Hey, so what happened, Rob? 
[02:49:30]  I don't, I didn't know you were talking about this.  We got an email from somebody and it was like, wow, Rob might be checking out.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it was ugly.  What did it happen at work?  It happened on the way to work.  It was the first day back after vacation.  We'd been on vacation for two weeks.  Summer vacation.  Summer vacation.  And I was coming up the, uh, the ramp at the parking lot on 32nd street and my legs  felt really heavy and I couldn't catch my breath.  And next thing I know, some guy's going, Hey dude, you aight?  You aight? 
[02:50:00]  I'm on my back.  Out.  Out.  Out.  Wow.  I passed out.  I just collapsed.  I didn't, you know, once I got to the top.  Did you feel sick when you woke up or anything like that?  No, that's the weird thing.  I felt great.  We're leading up to this?  I felt great.  And I had gone for a stress test on the Friday prior.  Oh, great.  That's why.  Those fucking stress tests, let me tell you, that's why.  But here's the fucking thing.  They shook some things loose there, Rob.  No, but here's the fucking thing is I'm in the emergency room in St. Vincent's Hospital  and I'm getting the results of the stress test from the fucking doctor. 
[02:50:30]  Hey, you're fine.  Yeah, you're great.  It's flying colors.  Really?  So I was lucky, you know, that this guy woke me up because, you know, I don't know  if you're familiar with that neighborhood.  There's no shortage of unconscious men at 530 in the morning on 32nd Street.  Yeah.  But, so I got to the studio and then I called 911 and they sent the, you know, the ambulance.  Wait, you woke up because the guy said you're all right.  Yeah.  And you proceeded to continue to work and then call 911?  Yeah.  How about you call it right from the sidewalk?  Because I wanted to make sure I just knew I was coming to work. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah.  That I wasn't, you know, ride.  I know, I'm sure I missed with Doc to pay or something.  But meanwhile...  Good thing that didn't happen yesterday.  I would have thought you were gay.  That's...  I understand.  On his back, Chelsea.  Yeah.  And, you know, speaking of gay, by the way, Stephen S. from Bayshore, all kidding aside,  should have been invited to the wedding.  He was one that I, in the end, I got lazy and I should have invited.  Was Pat from Unaki invited?  Pat probably wouldn't have made it if I continued thinking about the list.  So all the people who were at your bachelor party. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  A lot of those guys maybe should have been invited to.  They didn't make the cut.  Big A didn't make the cut?  No.  No.  Big A.  He read the letters to the Corinthians or whatever.  The whole thing took you five hours.  So now you're at work, Rob.  Yeah.  I was at work and...  Call 911.  They show up with the ambulance.  What was Zymus saying through this whole thing?  Well, he was still out at the ranch.  Oh, shit.  So I'm in like one of the equipment rooms, you know, off the street. 
[02:52:00]  And the EMTs show up and the first thing the guy says to his partner goes,  we're going to need a couple more people.  Oh, shit.  So that's what you want.  You know, you want to make a fucking fat joke when you're done.  Yeah, yeah.  So they actually got a couple of homeless guys to help pick up the...  For real?  The gurney to stick it in the back of the ambulance.  What was wrong?  I had a pulmonary embolism.  I had a blood clot behind my left knee that came loose and passed through my heart and landed. 
[02:52:30]  They call it a saddle clot.  It landed in the artery between both lungs.  And some, like, 85%, 90% of people who have that don't get up.  So I'm pretty lucky.  You're a real lucky man.  Yeah, but now I've got all this fucking pressure now.  I have to find meaning for my life.  I don't need this shit.  Nah.  Yeah.  You know?  You're like, wow.  Wow.  There's a reason I'm still...  I don't believe that crap.  Oh, there's a reason.  God wanted me to...  He kept me here.  No, it was some...  You just got lucky.  You just got lucky.  Some lucky thing that just...  Like a lucky bounce in baseball.  You got a lucky bounce. 
[02:53:00]  A lucky bounce.  I'm serious.  I don't believe in that.  Well, he must have something in store for me.  How'd they fix that?  They don't.  They were going to go in and take it out.  But that was, you know, potentially...  The clot can break off.  Wouldn't that be bad if it's like...  It's like, all right, we got...  Uh-oh, it got away from us.  I had a clot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So it's still there?  They had me on blood thinner.  Supposedly, it's been worn down.  They took the ones out of the leg surgically with this little Roto-Rooter thing. 
[02:53:30]  And then they put a net in on the other side.  Yeah, they do that.  So that would catch them.  And they got me on the Coumadin, which is rat poison.  I had a thin...  Seriously.  Yeah, yeah, because what it does is it makes the rats just bleed internally.  So they thin the blood.  And supposedly that breaks down the clots and then your body absorbs them and whatever.  How much Coumadin?  A lot?  I take three.  Big dose?  Three pills a day.  You can't be in an accident or any of that stuff.  I can't shave.  You got to be very careful. 
[02:54:00]  Can't shave, nothing.  You're shaving, though.  Electroquoise.  Ah, very nice.  Do you get an erection?  Huh?  Does the blood thinner fuck your rods up?  Oh, well...  Kinda.  Kinda.  Kinda.  I mean...  Jesus, Rob, you're a ball of laughs.  Well, I just...  You know what?  I had problems in the game with...  No rods.  Blood thinner.  Can't shave.  Before the clots.  You know, I was having problems.  Anyway.  Mostly premature.  Like, really premature.  How premature?  Sure.  During dinner. 
[02:54:30]  So...  It doesn't help that you wear...  I remember ordering Alfredo.  I'd like to see him while I listen.  It doesn't help that you're wearing all black like Johnny Cash now.  It's slimming.  How about a little sunshine there, Rob?  Black is slimming.  I'm trying to...  How about a little sunshine?  There you go.  What do you want me to do?  Are you on a strict diet and exercise and all that?  Oh, no.  No, no, no.  And being fat has nothing to do with it, which is great.  So, I mean, I still should lose 100 pounds, but...  Actually, I'm going to the doctor today.  I'm going to get the, you know, the test where they bend you over the table and the...  Oh, give you the old whammy whammy. 
[02:55:00]  Can I say...  Does your dentist do that?  No, no.  Not my dentist.  I thought it was a little...  No, that's weird.  I got a doctor that...  My hairdresser.  Yeah.  He doesn't.  I got a doctor that loves doing it.  You come in with strep throat, you're going to get your hiney checked.  See, this is what I don't understand.  How does somebody go through all those years of medical school, residency, internship, and  then they decide, you know what?  This is my calling.  This stick my finger in strange men's assholes.  Where does...  We got it figured out.  You do?  Day guy.  Is that it?  Found a loophole. 
[02:55:30]  Really?  There's no way you decide you want to look at asses for a living unless somehow it turns  you on a little bit.  I mean, OB-GYN.  Put doctor, same thing.  Put fetish thing.  I don't know.  Fucking gynecologists, they're just pervs.  They save it for last, too, the doctors.  Oh, yeah.  Because I know when you do the yearly physical, it's everything else they do.  The chest x-ray, they check your eyes, your ears, your throat, everything else.  They do that friggin' gives me the heebie-jeebies where they feel around for things.  They're like, yeah, let me feel your neck. 
[02:56:00]  I'm like, no, it's not what I'm doing.  You don't like that?  A little ticklish.  I don't know.  It gives me the heebie-jeebies.  Not good.  Not good.  And then the grand finale is...  The headliner.  The headliner comes out.  Ladies and gentlemen, we want to bring out your headliner.  Big hand for the finger in the ass.  Come on, everyone.  Give it up for the finger up the ass.  And he tries to make small talk.  That's the thing that kills me.  It's like we're both trying to pretend that this isn't going on.  You might feel a slight pinch, Bob.  Yeah.  It's like I made a sound that I can only imagine a virgin homosexual makes the first time he 
[02:56:30]  gets it.  You moaned and it came on your leg.  Yeah, I did.  That's exactly what it was.  It was like...  You feel like a Muppet.  I mean...  Yeah.  And then they just peel off a few paper towels and give them to you.  And they have the degrading where you got to wipe the lubricant out of your ass.  And then driving home, you feel it.  It's squishy.  And then when you get home, you got to shower.  So you take your underwear off and there's just this wad of lubricant in there and you 
[02:57:00]  just feel violated.  Just violated.  I got a Pavlovian response to it now.  The minute that glove snaps, my asshole slams shut like a bear trap.  It ain't nothing.  They say some guys come when they're getting that procedure done.  Yes, we do.  That's the milking the prostate thing.  And who does that?  That usually costs us 50 bucks, right?  That would have to be the gayest man ever.  They say it happens.  In a doctor's office environment.  Get Dr. Steve on the phone.  And they say it's not even a sexual thing. 
[02:57:30]  It's just because you're touching the prostate or something?  It all sounds like, oh, fuck, you just start spraying.  He's not giving a reach around at the same time.  That's what they say happens, my friend.  That's a magic button.  Huh?  I guess.  That's a magic button.  Well, G-spot for the dude.  God, that just doesn't...  So, Rob, how long were you in the hospital?  Two weeks.  And it was touch and go for a while.  Yeah, the operation, I think they were the most worried about.  They did a sonogram while I was in the emergency room to check to make sure the heart wasn't 
[02:58:00]  straining to push the blood past the clot into the lung.  Oh.  And so that's why they didn't want to do that surgically.  And they figured that if the heart was in trouble, the heart, you know, they were going  to just do it because it would be a life-threatening deal.  Right.  But the heart was in great shape.  The heart's in great shape.  How big is a blood clot?  This one was about the size of an Almond Joy, apparently.  Yeah.  For real?  Yeah.  An Almond Joy?  Like what?  Like one of those little things.  It was that big? 
[02:58:30]  That's why it was so bad.  Wait.  The whole candy bar?  The whole candy bar?  Yeah.  There's two of those little...  Yeah.  Why can't they take that out?  Well, because if they disrupted it, if they moved it before they put the net in, it could  have traveled to my...  Well, if the net's in, they get it, right?  Depends on which way it goes.  I think because of where it was located.  Yeah.  Was it going into the lungs or was it coming out?  The superior or the inferior venicava?  Actually, Anthony, it was on the bridge, what they call the saddle clunk. 
[02:59:00]  The pulmonary artery or the pulmonary vein?  A pulmonary artery, apparently.  Ah, so that's going back to the heart.  Yes.  Which is backwards, as a matter of fact, from the pulmonary vein, from veins and arteries  because veins carry the blood that is already deoxygenated.  You don't prove this, right?  But in the pulmonary vein and artery, it's backwards because it's going away from the  heart to the lung to be re-oxygenated.  But what about, can't they just clip either side of the clot, like just fucking stop the 
[02:59:30]  vein real quick and then fucking cut it out and then re-stitch the vein?  What the fuck?  Do you think there's some heart surgeon that studied everything about the heart for his  entire life that just listening to this show went, oh my God, Jimmy Norton just figured  this out for us.  They're going to call it, yeah, Norton's embolism.  It's Norton's embolism surgery.  I thought they were going to call it the Ted Procedure.  No.  Ted has nothing on this one.  I know. 
[03:00:00]  Does he?  Ted, the heart surgeon?  Yes.  Of course.  Ted, the heart surgeon might have something.  One time I opened someone's heart and there were little candies in it on Valentine's Day.  Brax.  A Brax heart.  Hey, Rob, where are you going to be?  You're going to be...  I'm doing a Christmas show at Gotham.  Nice.  Saturday night and brokerage on Sunday night.  Very cool.  This weekend.  How's the radio show going?  Great.  How's Imas?  Great.  Great.  Haven't heard in a while.  Yeah.  Mel.  Mel, you know. 
[03:00:30]  Mel.  No good.  Mel.  Please.  Please.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  People are saying that Ant is wrong about his knowledge.  Ant's a dope.  What?  Yeah.  No, about the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein.  Psycho Bob has your beard.  All right.  Let me see.  So I got him, Psycho Bob.  Let me talk to Psycho Bob then.  All right.  Psycho Bob.  Psycho Bob.  Professor Ant.  Where am I wrong with the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein?  All right.  Arteries always lead blood away from the heart. 
[03:01:00]  Uh-huh.  Veins always return blood to the heart.  And that's why I was saying the pulmonary artery is the only artery in the human body that  carries deoxygenated blood.  You said that it was leading blood away from the heart.  I'm sorry.  You said it was the artery was leading blood back to the heart, didn't you?  No, I said the artery.  You are correct in that it is deoxygenated blood.  Yes.  And it's an artery that carries the, you know, blue blood, they say.  And the vein carries the red oxygenated blood back. 
[03:01:30]  Right.  But it's always that arteries lead blood away from the heart.  Right.  And the veins lead it back to the heart.  Oh, I understand that.  I was just talking about whether it's oxygenated or deoxygenated blood.  We're going to learn this.  Yes.  Thank you.  Punch it out.  I learned that actually in school.  Forget Aristotle and fuck Socrates.  Here comes Professor Anthony.  Thank you.  Nice.  He's not only an alcoholic, he's really smart.  I'm going to try. 
[03:02:00]  What are you guys talking about on the IMA show?  What's the big topic?  Blagojevich.  I mean, this guy is.  Oh, boy.  Isn't he great?  That's like a gift from God.  They might have Jesse Jackson's son.  He could be number five.  Candidate number five.  Might be Jackson's son.  Like client number nine.  Yeah.  Could be.  Man, this guy.  What's candidate?  Just trying to sell the seat.  Trying to sell the seat.  I don't have a problem with that.  And is this something that is business as usual when things happen like that? 
[03:02:30]  I don't have a problem with that.  You don't have a problem?  I mean, you know, everything's for sale.  Everything's got a price.  Yeah.  Even a Senate seat.  If I was him, I would have put it up on fucking eBay.  Now, that would be interesting.  A Senate seat.  Available now.  A Senate seat.  You get a bid on it.  Oh, I'm going to pay the buy now.  I'm going to do the buy now because I really want this.  On a Senate seat, you got to go with the buy now.  Yeah.  You can't take chances.  PayPal.  PayPal.  PayPal.  He's a great head of hair, doesn't he?  Holy shit, does he have a JFK do.  That fucking hair is fucking good. 
[03:03:00]  He looks a little like Janet Reno, doesn't he?  Wow.  Yeah, he does.  Kind of look that way.  Yeah, he's been a naughty boy, though.  Oh, which is...  I love when they talk about how he's just calling Obama a motherfucker.  Oh, yeah.  The language in it is great.  His wife isn't any better.  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  Oh, she's awful.  Horrible.  It is great, though, that when they bug these people now, you just get the real raw language.  Oh, it's unbelievable.  And even Obama told him, you know, step down.  What are you doing?  And he says no.  After that huge bail that he had to post, I don't know how he's supporting himself. 
[03:03:30]  What was that?  $4,000 he had to pay bail?  He's fucking politicians, man.  They're all scared up there.  It's amazing.  He probably has stuff on everybody.  In case you guys are wondering, there actually is a Senate seat for sale up on eBay.  Oh, is there?  Somebody is.  It's currently going.  Somebody smart.  Yeah, it's going for $61.  That's it?  Buy now?  That's not a fucking real Senate seat, dude.  It's probably just a chair.  Oh, literal gym.  It's a chair.  What about, I'm sure you guys were batting around the whole Obama thing before he got 
[03:04:00]  elected, and where did you stand on that one?  I think it's, I mean...  Were you pro or con?  I've been pro.  Pro-Obama?  You're pro-Obama?  I'm pro-change.  Yeah?  I'm pro-change.  That's, you know, today.  Tomorrow.  Yeah.  So when does the change happen?  When he appoints a cabinet full of people we've seen for years and years?  This change is hysterical.  I thought maybe, you know, Louis Farrakhan was coming in, and some fucking, like, old 
[03:04:30]  Soviet socialist, communist, and it's the same guys we've seen batted around forever.  Well, you can't take too many chances.  No.  Especially when your whole platform was changed.  The liberals are all getting annoyed that they're not getting these seats, these appointments  by Obama.  It's business as usual.  I'm waiting.  I think they took him in the back room when they gave him that little security clearance 
[03:05:00]  thing, which is odd that that's the first meeting that the president-elect has, is they  fill him in on, like, national security things and some of the more secretive things.  Before you make your appointment to get to football and all that.  Yeah, yeah.  They fill him in on all that fun stuff.  And when he walks out, the hair's a little wider.  It's like when Moses came down from Mount Ararat, or what was that?  Holy shit.  Mount Sinai.  Was it Sinai or Mount Ararat?  Which one was it?  It was Arry Lodge.  It was Mount Arry Lodge. 
[03:05:30]  Did you see the South Park episode?  It was, like, the day after the election where they had Obama and McCain actually working  together to, like, rob.  They were robbing the...  It was great.  But what they did was they actually had the speech that Obama gave, and they had it.  I mean, what did they turn those episodes in?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  The day they aired?  Real quick.  Yeah, they said they did.  Oh, it was before, so they're fucking...  Obviously.  Rob, look at the animation.  It stinks.  Watch the quick turnaround.  I wish they'd turn it around quick.  Wouldn't it?  That's animation?  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  Something like that.  They're real people?  They're real, just strange-looking people.  But the mystery is really simple.  Whoever gives Obama the secret documents and all that, that's the guy running the country.  So who is that guy?  Yeah, he's a secret document guy.  He knows everything.  The secret document guy really runs the country.  The president is just a figurehead.  There's actually a guy named Chauncey Gardner.  No, it's not.  No, you smile, Jimmy.  That's from a movie.  I think he'll enjoy this.  It looks like Jimmy's reading for another role.  Yeah.  Is your character Chauncey Gardner?  No.  Did you ever see Being There?  Huh?  It's a reference to a film in the 80s. 
[03:06:30]  Peter Sartre.  Oh, fuck.  Now I look stupid.  That's all right.  It's a weird one.  I like to watch, Eve.  Very good.  Yeah, the idiot savant.  Hey, let's get back to assholes.  We got Dr. Steve on the phone.  Okay.  Oh, good.  Dr. Steve, how are you, sir?  Hey, Vintner to the stars.  Hi, Steve.  Yes.  Why don't you get off the speakerphone unless you got your hand up some guy's ass?  Hang on a second.  I'm going to move.  I'm in a, I'm in a, I'm in a, I'm in a, I'm in a, I'm in a, I'm in a hospital.  Bank vault.  I'm in a hospital, so now I'm in a patient lounge now.  If somebody comes in, I'll probably have to bail on you, but.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  All right.  We're, we're talking about getting fingers up the ass.  What, what was the question for Dr. Steve?  It was actually, do, do some men orgasm spontaneously during one of these, uh, prostate exams?  So, Dr.  Yeah, absolutely.  Really?  And is it sexual or is it more of a, just a physical thing because you, you touch the  prostate?  Yeah, it's a physical thing.  What happens is, is they will ejaculate, not necessarily have an orgasm.  As you press on the, on the prostate, you can actually express fluid out.  And we'll do that on purpose sometimes. 
[03:07:30]  If we think someone's got a prostate infection, you just stick your finger in, you go up one  side, down the other, and then push real hard down the middle.  And then you'll express fluid out onto a slide and look at it under the microscope or whatever  you want to with it.  Or make wine out of it.  Yeah, you do it to an elephant and then all that elephant pre-cum, you fucking put a little  red stuff that you got from Jim Jones' house.  Part of your job is you study jism. 
[03:08:00]  Absolutely.  Under the microscope and smell it to see if it smells like it's infected.  All kinds of stuff.  Wow.  You really, you really taste.  Like it's a bag of cocaine with Colombians in the room.  Wait a minute.  He's got to give it a little taste.  Yeah, it's good stuff.  It's been cut.  Now we know why he's a winemaker.  It sounds like the same thing you do when you've got a nice bottle of wine.  You smell the cork a little bit.  This is cut with crazy glue.  This juice has a lovely nose.  You squeeze the cork for moisture and then you do the little taste test. 
[03:08:30]  Yes, Dr. Steve, you did get quite a thrashing.  I must thank you, though, for those cookies.  Yeah.  Those are fantastic.  Bravo on that, my friend.  Those are the same ones that Opie threw on the floor.  Yeah, one of them, but I had a nice box of them when I got home.  And wow, really good.  Thank you so much, Dr. Steve.  Steve, you know I play a role on the radio.  I enjoyed your blue boxes of goodness.  Well, it was the best Christmas present I ever had getting thrashed by you guys for 40 minutes. 
[03:09:00]  It really just went, it did go on and on and on.  It was endless.  Casey was in her car and she went in to do a sales call and came back out.  She said, and they were still talking about you.  It's still railing you in your wine.  Didn't we have another doctor question for you?  Well, let me tell you one thing about the smelling things and tasting things back.  Before we had urine dipsticks, doctors had to actually taste patients' urine to see if they had diabetes. 
[03:09:30]  And that's why it's called diabetes mellitus or mellitus because the word mellitus means taste sweet.  No fucking way, dude.  How long ago?  Because I understand 1800s, they were weird.  A week and a half?  A week and a half ago.  18?  I'm thinking like 1400s.  Nah, the 1800s, they were still doing fucked up stuff.  What year?  Another kind of diabetes where people just pee out free water and it's called diabetes insipidus.  And insipid means that it just tasted insipid. 
[03:10:00]  So that's where those words came from.  What year were they still doing this?  You had to sip it.  That's what that meant.  Sip it.  Yeah, I'll get the exact years for you when we finally got urine dipstick.  Praise the Lord for that.  No kidding.  Jesus, how long did that take?  After the first doctor tasted it, I'd be like, I'm inventing the urine dipstick.  They're calling you a cum smeller, Dr. Steve.  I'm really sorry for that.  They shouldn't.  Age fucker, you know.  But you're eating his cookies.  That's the thing that's most disturbing.  Right.  He's expressing fluid. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, you're eating his fucking cookies.  That's true.  If it comes out smelling rancid like pus, you can't help it.  Oh, my God.  I mean, it's not like you put it up to your nose.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to make you smell cum next time you come to New York.  You know that, right?  That sounds like a better bit than the other bit that I used to.  Oh, you'd rather smell cum than stick fingers up a guy's ass?  That's a thing called sarcasm, my friend.  Okay.  Sorry, you got me on that one.  Because I'll fucking whip out a batch onto a slide for a finger smell as a joke.  That's right.  Because you're good like that, Jim.  Yeah, here you go, you silly goose. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah, now smell this.  Take a whiff.  So.  Well, Dr. Steve, thank you so much for your generous Christmas gifts.  It was nice.  You're welcome.  And, yes.  Thank you guys for trashing me on the air and for letting me be on with the great Rob Bartlett.  I'm a huge fan.  Yes.  Are you really?  Well, thank you, Dr. Steve.  Very cool.  I have a very different opinion than you know.  Why don't you ask Rob a question there, Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  So, well, how are things going?  That's really insightful. 
[03:11:30]  That's a good one.  That's really great.  Thanks.  Thanks, Steve.  I'm a great interviewer.  Hey, Dr. Steve, our theory that, like, guys that look at assholes all day, a little bit  on the homo side.  Yeah, I don't know if that's true.  I'll tell you what.  Proctology is a really, it's an easy surgical specialty.  And a lot of the proctologists get mad at me.  But it's very circumscribed, and you only have to handle a certain number of problems.  And so a lot of people go into proctology because of that. 
[03:12:00]  I'm glad that people are interested in going in that so that I wouldn't have, you know,  been in a situation where I would have had to be forced to do it.  You know, so I'm really glad that people are interested in doing proctology.  It's just, you know.  How far up does a proctologist cover?  And then it goes to, like, the other, you know, intestinal doctor or whatever that is.  Gastroenterologist.  Gastroenterologist.  Yeah, you know, proctologists will do rectum, sigmoid, colon, that kind of thing.  So their whole job is, what, two, three knuckles? 
[03:12:30]  That's about it.  It's about an inch and a half on a whiffle ball back.  I would guess the same distance that a nice cock could get in there.  Oh, is that it?  If you listen to the questions on, say, my show or the things that you all talk about,  I mean, who doesn't have asshole problems, you know?  And so there's a lot of business for proctology.  At some point in their lives.  And it affects your well-being.  Usually our asshole problems involve going to a meeting over at Sirius. 
[03:13:00]  Hey, gynecologists, what are they about?  Yeah, that's an interesting one.  There are quite a few women in gynecology now,  and most of the women that I know that go to women gynecologists say they're rougher than the men.  And that's a broad generalization for all the women, GYNs.  I'm sure you have many that listen to the show.  You know, don't get mad at me. 
[03:13:30]  But OB is a really satisfying thing because you're bringing new life into the world.  And, you know, I delivered probably 250 babies in my training,  and I kind of got a little weepy every time I did one.  I guess.  That's right.  You met up.  That's why you now sniff and cum.  Well, I'm just being honest.  Aw.  Aw.  The thing about it is that...  That's good.  The doctor's crying.  Right.  Well, you're supposed to be cutting the umbilical cord, Grace.  You know, somebody has to have a Moe Howard haircut, Doc? 
[03:14:00]  What are you trying for?  This is so beautiful.  Can we get a doctor that's not a fruit?  It's time to cut this thing.  Stop crying.  Huh.  Sorry.  But then there's all of those moments,  and then you've got these moments of absolute, sheer, unmitigated panic  when something goes wrong.  And so that's why I couldn't go into it.  But, you know, people like it.  It's a surgical field where you get to do things,  and it's sort of self-limited.  You've got a nine-month period where you see the patient,  and then they're out of there. 
[03:14:30]  So, yeah, yeah.  And then you're kind of building up a little relationship.  You want to see what this is like.  I would think a moment of sheer panic...  What happened?  I'm sorry.  It's being paged.  I would think a moment of sheer panic would be watching the husband and wife  standing there, both white and a black baby coming out,  and you panicking, having to hold up the baby in front of the husband.  The opposite happens a lot, that little babies of African-American descent 
[03:15:00]  don't have all of their melanin cells kicking in when they're first born.  Really?  And so they come out looking extremely light very often.  And there are instances where the father wondered what had been going on  because where did this white baby come from.  But then after a day or two, the melanin cells kick in,  and then everything's okay, and there's a happy ending.  After a day or two, God, you know, gives his curse. 
[03:15:30]  Jesus.  What's that supposed to mean?  I don't know.  Do you understand who's sitting here?  Allegedly.  Dodged a bullet.  Why is Rob running out the door?  He's not healthy enough to run, but he's running.  I'm heading out, guys.  He's fine.  Oh, Jimmy Norton's got a pack.  Yeah, I've got to go to fucking L.A.  Pack your bags.  Rob, thanks for the Imus autograph.  Rob got Imus to sign my picture, which was a great thrill. 
[03:16:00]  Does Imus like Jimmy's book there, Rob?  Imus loves Jimmy's book.  I thought he's even looked at it.  I think Jimmy should be on the shadow for a moment.  Does Imus call you a...  I don't think.  Huh?  Yeah, he wouldn't have me on.  I must call you a wussy.  He friggin' had a collapsed lung when he fell off that horse.  Yeah, he still phoned in.  Yeah.  He still phoned in.  So did I, though.  I phoned in from the hospital.  Yeah.  We phoned in every day.  No.  That's our job.  Did you see what I wrote on the back of the envelope for the...  Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I didn't see it. 
[03:16:30]  Courier.  Get paid.  Don't shit on this.  Don't shit on this.  Courier.  Courier.  Don't shit on this.  I'm excited.  Funnier than the losers on my program.  Did you really?  Yeah.  Nice.  All right, Jimmy.  Bye for you.  This weekend, Rob.  Always a pleasure.  James.  Thank you.  We'll see Jimmy on Monday.  Safe trip, Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, I hope so.  Is this the Viper Room kick?  I'm doing it, yeah, tomorrow and Saturday.  You could always text me if you get lonely.  Oh, I will.  On the plane.  LOL.  Yeah.  All right, guys. 
[03:17:00]  All right, Jimmy.  All right, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Darkseed says bye.  All right.  I'm going to L.A.  Jimmy's all over the place.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  See you next week, Jimmy.  He looks sad.  No, he's...  Is he tired?  Yeah, he's probably sleepy.  We don't sleep.  You know, morning.  That's true.  Morning radio is so bad.  That's why we go back to afternoons.  Oh, you are?  No, we're not.  Yeah, we really are.  Jeez.  No, we're not.  Yeah, we are.  No, we're not.  Yeah, we are. 
[03:17:30]  No, we're not.  That'd be like the old days.  Yeah, we're going old school, my friend.  Better not be.  We're going old school, my friend.  Old school, which means a Jägermeister machine.  I was just trying to go for a joke that failed miserably, so don't worry.  Well, that's not a joke for you, Opie.  Thanks.  That's happened.  Thanks.  That'll help.  The show ends with a whimper rather than a bang.  Dr. Steve is still on the phone.  I'm sorry.  Still on the phone.  Sorry.  I thought maybe there's a patient there.  Well, just snake a tube up his nose and tell him I'll be there in an hour. 
[03:18:00]  Caddyshack?  No.  Whatever.  It's bad when you've got to actually point to the reference.  Caddyshack.  Ta-da.  Bum.  What a bum.  Dr. Peepers.  Was it Peepers?  Dr. Beeper and I have been...  I used to call him Dr....  Was it a Peeper?  It was Beeper.  Dr. Beeper.  It was Beeper.  It was the Beeper.  Danny.  Danny and Lacey Underalls.  Fell miserably here.  All right, Dr. Steve, thank you so much. 
[03:18:30]  Yes, doctor.  Always very informative.  Always great to have you.  And again, thank you for your generous Christmas gifts.  I don't talk to you guys before.  I have a great holiday.  Well, two plugs.  Your strange medicine, which is a brilliant concept for a radio show.  Very interesting.  When's the next one?  The next weird medicine?  Oh, weird medicine.  I'm sorry.  It will be December 27th.  It's pre-recorded our Christmas extravagant.  Nice.  And also, that website that you sent to me, I checked out.  It's pretty cool.  Which website is that? 
[03:19:00]  You've got some kind of website you do.  Two girls, one girl.  And you're like blogging and stuff.  Yeah.  Meatspin.  Meatspin.  Meatspin.com.  He explains the physics behind the rotating penis in Meatspin.  What is it?  Drsteve.com?  Yeah.  Drsteve.com.  Wow, you got that one.  Do you spell out doctor?  I got both of them.  I've got the spelled out one and the abbreviated.  How did he get that?  I don't know.  I think there'd be a lot of Drsteves around.  That's pretty smart.  I had to control some other Drsteve. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Kind of get some muscle on him.  He wouldn't do a nice thing with it.  All right.  That sounds important.  Cold blue.  Cold blue.  Crash cart.  Somebody's coding it.  He's on the phone with you guys.  He's just, yeah, I'll get to it.  Clear!  All right.  We got a tasing video and then we're going to go to break.  Rob Bartlett's going to be at Gotham Comedy Club.  This Saturday?  Yes.  Yes.  Two shows.  Two shows.  The big old Christmas show with the reunion of the Bartlettes.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  The Bartlettes.  Oh, we're the Bartlettes.  Bartlettes is my backup group.  Okay.  Some hot babes in some skimpy Santa costumes that will come out and they'll accompany Blind  Mississippi White Boy, Pig Feeds Dupree and his new version of Shave Yo Kitty.  Nice.  Oh.  Which is a new blue song.  Are you, I meant to ask you this for so long.  Now I kept forgetting.  Were you, did you have a bit part in Midnight Run?  You know.  Have you been asked that before? 
[03:20:30]  I've been asked that before.  No.  It looks like a young Rob Bartlett in the airplane.  Yes.  It would have been a young Rob Bartlett too.  Yes.  Midnight Run was.  Because I looked and I was like, what the hell, that looks like Rob Bartlett.  Yeah, it's a little spooky, isn't it?  Yeah, yeah.  I tell it to people all the time.  You do?  It's not me though.  I saw it recently and I was like, I got to ask Rob that because I think he's probably  too, you know, I think you were younger than the guy is on the plane.  Probably.  Yeah, because I was like, I'm trying to do some math there and math hurts my head. 
[03:21:00]  But yeah, kind of looked like you.  Yeah, no, I wasn't.  I wish it was.  Yeah.  Funny movie.  That was a great movie.  Okay.  That would be a good movie to be in.  Yes.  Some of the shitty movies I've been in.  At least you're good to be in movies.  Yeah.  True.  They're not exactly movies.  It could always be worse.  Well, technically they're movies.  The first thing I was in was something called the Sex O'Clock News where they were trying  to do like a, almost like a, what was that movie?  Almost like a Groove Tube.  Yeah.  Kentucky Fried movie kind of a thing.  It was centered around a news team.  Sure.  And I was the Puerto Rican sportscaster, Marty Cohn. 
[03:21:30]  So that's where.  Ah, so that was the level of a human.  Yeah.  That's where the bar was set.  That's where they set the bar on that one.  That was the first one.  And then I had, I was a Hindu cab driver in a movie called Spin the Bottle, where I actually  got to ad lib, which was fun.  You know, I didn't have a script.  Yeah.  And then I did.  What were you, Haji doing?  I was, I was kind of just, I was just, some of those awful, just stereotypical. 
[03:22:00]  I could get you to the airport in 20 minutes.  It all depends on whether it's high or low tide.  Oh, yes.  Of course.  And then I did, I did something called Table One with, with Burt Young and.  Oh, okay.  Oh, wow.  And Stephen Baldwin.  And, and, and, um, it was, it's, it's actually, it's not a bad movie, but it's, you know,  I, I'm very, I'm at the end.  I'm in the very end.  I play, I play an agent.  The most important part is they, um, are images that are captured and move. 
[03:22:30]  Yes.  Which technically makes it a movie.  Absolutely.  So, and you can actually purchase them on duty.  Right.  And that's all that counts.  See, that's what counts.  That's all that counts.  Are you doing Broadway?  No, no, Broadway now.  There may be something coming up next year.  We'll see.  The Great White Way, as they call it.  Yes, yes.  He was great in Odd Couple.  What was the other one I saw you in?  I saw you in two, didn't I?  No.  Just the one?  You only saw Odd Couple.  You were supposed to come see Chicago because.  Yeah.  I didn't want to see Chicago.  Because your wife now really wanted to see it.  You know, because he got married. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah.  Now she's a wife.  I couldn't do the musical thing.  I'm sorry.  Well, see, that's what's great about Chicago.  You know what musicals?  They're all in Fish Nuts.  They're all in Fish Nuts.  It's all hot babes and Fish Nuts.  The girls look good.  It's a beautiful thing.  Yeah.  I went to a couple of musicals.  I saw Les Mis.  You see Les Mis?  I went to Les Mis.  That's a very inspirational story.  A lot of singing and shooting in that one.  Yeah, singing and shooting.  The problem with musicals, they sing too much.  Well, that's, you know.  Except, you know what?  You know what musicals I don't sing a lot?  You're relieved when they take two minutes to talk.  You're like, oh, finally. 
[03:23:30]  Miracle Worker.  Oh, they're just setting up the next song.  There's not a lot of singing in that one.  Not a lot of singing.  No.  There's a wah-wah ballet.  Wah-wah.  Wah-wah.  Wah-wah.  Why, as a child, did that make me laugh my ass off?  Me and my brother would watch the old Miracle Worker.  With Patty Duke.  With Patty Duke.  And when she puts her hand under that pump and feels the water,  and she's going, wah-wah-wah.  For years, me and my brother did that. 
[03:24:00]  Under the sink, you turn it on, and to get a glass of water,  and you just put your hand on there and go, whoa,  and the other guy's just laughing his ass off.  Absolutely.  It's the same kind of, like, the kind of laugh that you really,  you know you're not supposed to be laughing.  Yeah, yeah.  During the Thanksgiving Day Parade, they had the color guard.  Oh, right.  The special needs color guard.  Yeah, and you're like, ah, but you're chuckling a little bit.  Well, because there's a blind guy dancing with his girl,  and then she dances away, and he's standing by himself.  He has no idea where he is. 
[03:24:30]  But he is.  So she knows he's in front of Macy's.  That's all.  It's awful.  Amazing.  Obama's having a press conference today?  Yeah.  To talk about Chicago, probably?  I don't know.  They're actually, they're not sure if they're going to be able to ask him  any of those questions.  He's been having a lot of press conferences and, you know,  talking about what he's going to do, who he's appointing.  Well, he's already doing it.  And whatnot.  He is the president.  Is he?  Well, Bush isn't.  No, that's for sure.  He's completely now just giving up any hope of any legacy. 
[03:25:00]  I like all the stuff that he's coming out with now,  you know, all these regrets and things.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, now that I think about it, it probably wasn't a good idea.  Good idea.  He would have to, like the last day of his administration,  be like, here's the cure for AIDS.  Here's the cure for cancer.  I've been working on this for eight years.  I can bring up my friend Jesus.  So the problem, all the resources that I needed for these cures were in Iraq.  But I can now tell you why.  And people would be like, fucking guy is a genius and a miracle work. 
[03:25:30]  Everything.  He's going to give the.  He's going to give the.  Eternal youth.  The secret to eternal youth.  He's going to give the whole country a big fuck you.  Because he's going to show Osama.  Here you go, fuckers.  You think?  No.  No, of course not.  That would be fucking awesome.  That guy's done.  And then Obama's saying that very shortly after he is the president,  he wants to give a major speech in a Muslim city.  Sort of like a healing thing.  Not.  It's not to be interpreted as some kind of concession or any kind of, you know, hey, we're going 
[03:26:00]  to be lenient on terrorism and stuff.  But he wants to go to a Muslim city and give a speech there and address these people to  try to make peace.  Well, he's going to go with a very safe one.  Which one do you think he would go with?  I don't know.  What's that place in Jersey?  Where they were allegedly celebrating after 9-11.  That's not a bad idea, though, don't you think?  I mean, to try and...  I like it.  What's what you're going to be dealing with over the next? 
[03:26:30]  I like it to a point.  You know what?  If Bush went there, they would be burning the effigies and the flags and everything like  that.  I think Obama going there, if it...  Look, I'm a real Republican kind of leaning conservative guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, surprise.  And even I'm thinking...  That's what the guys in Malaysia say, by the way.  Yeah.  Just so you know.  By the way, and even I'm thinking, that might not be a bad idea, as long as it doesn't  show weakness.  He goes in there with weakness, anyway.  I think he's... 
[03:27:00]  Him just being there is weakness.  Being a Democrat isn't necessarily a strength thing.  Why is that making a difference?  It just...  Republicans are more known for being a little tougher with foreign policy than Democrats  are.  It's just the way it's always been.  Whether it works or it doesn't.  Harry Sherman had a pretty good foreign policy.  Yeah, over the time...  Well, you know something?  He had some foreign policy, that guy.  No kidding.  You can't say he didn't light up the foreign policy then. 
[03:27:30]  Well, you know, it just seems...  I think in time, it's changed.  Obviously, Democrat and Republican has changed over the years.  Where we are right now, I do think it's...  Democrats are looked at as being the weaker of the two as far as foreign policy goes with  strength.  With diplomacy, I think they do have a strength there.  But when you're in a position that we're in with terrorism and stuff, you've got to walk  a fine line between showing, hey, we're strong. 
[03:28:00]  We do have the capability and I do have the gumption to use our army.  But on the other hand, you know, I'm willing to sit down and talk to you.  So, and then it puts the ball kind of in their court.  And then if they fuck up by, you know, more terrorism, more of this, then you say, look,  I did all I could.  I tried.  Then you can't be lambasted by the rest of the world.  So...  But here's the thing.  Obama is really, really smart. 
[03:28:30]  I mean, he's got about 80 IQ points.  Perhaps more than that.  Perhaps more than that.  So, I think that that's, you know, I think you can kind of relax a little bit because  I think he's, because he's, I think he's been thinking about it too all this time.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  Absolutely.  The thing is, he is going to ruffle some feathers by just doing that.  By talking to, in a Muslim nation and trying to not even make peace, I guess just find common 
[03:29:00]  ground, say that, hey, look, you know, let's, let's try to work things out and be there.  But there's, there's such fanaticism on that side that I don't even think the amazing Barack  Obama and his, uh, his, uh, amazing speech, uh, speeches can, can stop that, you know?  Uh, I, who knows?  I'm so cynical with the whole thing at this point.  You know what?  And, and I, I think that that's, that that's the bottom line is that we've all been almost 
[03:29:30]  brainwashed to becoming cynics.  Yeah.  After all that we've, you know, have we, I think so, perhaps more than that.  He'll ruffle some feathers, but I think he's doing it cause he thinks he can make, uh, you  know, more good than, well, he's the one, he's like the one that could do it, you know?  Yeah, absolutely.  It's like, yeah.  If, if, if you want to do this whole change thing, that's the thing he can change because  people would be open to having him come over, uh, and, and, and speak and not just boo 
[03:30:00]  him and, and have to hold away millions of protesters and, and stuff.  Uh, what happens after that?  That's a whole mystery to me.  I don't know how it works out.  I think the United States is losing a lot of clout, has lost a lot of clout over the past  eight years, uh, militarily, uh, uh, diplomacy was, but, um, I'd hate to see it go the complete  other way where we, we just look weak and we get shit on again, like we did in the Carter  years. 
[03:30:30]  It's, uh, I don't think it shows weakness if he's, he's showing a willingness to, Oh no,  I'm not saying that.  I'm saying, I hope it doesn't come off that way.  And I hope, uh, I hope it, that some of these fanatics, uh, don't see an opening and an  opportunity and are given one by him.  They could see it, but I hope they aren't actually given an opportunity by his policies to,  uh, come back over here and really start their shenanigans.  As I like to put it, um, here on our homeland, everybody just wants to be heard.  Yeah.  I just want to be acknowledged. 
[03:31:00]  You just want to say, Hey, I'm here.  I'm here.  I'm queer.  We're fabulous.  Get used to us.  I'm here.  I'm queer.  We're fabulous.  My God, it's me, Margaret.  What are you doing?  Don't, don't, don't do, um, uh, jumping jacks.  He's doing, he's doing, he's doing, he's doing radio hands.  I thought he was bringing in a seven 67.  Yeah.  This way.  This way.  He wants, he wants some Turkish coffee.  Yeah, he's pulling down.  We got Rob Bartlett at Gotham for the big Christmas show.  What's the plug again there, Rob?
