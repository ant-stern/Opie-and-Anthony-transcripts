<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's final live broadcast of the year was plagued by significant technical difficulties, primarily affecting Jim Norton's microphone and the EROC feed display, which the hosts hilariously blamed on "the Radio Wizard."  The show opened with complaints about the malfunctioning equipment and the absence of staff members, including Gary, a technician, and several engineers. Mars, calling in, added to the litany of woes, detailing broken TVs, a falling object from the wall, and generally poor studio maintenance since his month-long absence.  Sal and Manny (an intern) were present in the studio.  Despite the chaos, the hosts managed to plow through their usual brand of vulgar and sexually explicit banter.

Early in the broadcast, they discussed past failed doomsday predictions, including Y2K, and their own improbable survival. They then received and commented on Christmas cookies from Sam Roberts' mother, followed by a lengthy and graphically detailed discussion about a news story featuring a former Olympic track star working as a high-priced escort.  The hosts' conversation was punctuated by numerous interruptions from technical issues and the repetitive playing of a Steve Wozniak audio excerpt, interspersed with the question, "What's that?"  This led to several comedic tangents.

The broadcast featured a comedic song about Gary, observations on a Wheel of Fortune contestant, Jimmy Norton's new mustache, and the hosts' personal anecdotes, including Jimmy's nephew's birth and a picture resembling him. Other topics included the Jets and Tim Tebow, Fezzy's fear of elevators, and another crude comedic song, "Three Whores, A Very Coomier Christmas."  The end of the world and past predictions were revisited before the arrival of Penn Jillette.


Penn Jillette joined the show and discussed his family's non-religious Christmas celebration, his wife's religious beliefs contrasting with his atheism, and the amusing story behind his daughter's middle name, "Crimefighter."  He detailed his experience on Celebrity Apprentice, describing his interactions with Donald Trump and contrasting the edited TV version with the reality. He also discussed the nature of arguments, using anecdotes to illustrate how seemingly trivial disagreements often mask deeper issues.  His views on the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting centered on criticizing the media's focus on the shooter's image and the rush to blame video games, while ignoring other preventable causes of childhood death. He shared a personal anecdote about a friend with Asperger's Syndrome.  A significant portion of this segment was punctuated by the ongoing discussion of the Newtown shooting.

Further discussion with Jillette involved a story about performing magic in impoverished areas of China, comparing it to their Vegas shows and contrasting cultural perspectives.  He shared stories about his mother and his late friend Jerry Camaro, a magician with extensive jailhouse tattoos.  The conversation also touched upon the availability of information in the pre- and post-internet era, and ended with promotional plugs for Jillette's work and a SiriusXM product. An additional crew member briefly appeared during this segment.  More tangential conversations included a recurring bit about a fictional "Uncle Paul" and sexually suggestive anecdotes about Opie's childhood.


The after-show featured Sam Roberts discussing his upcoming projects, including a live show with Rev Run, his Raw Dog Comedy Channel hosting duties (mentioning a New Year's Eve special with Carlos Mencia, Steve-O, an America's Got Talent contestant, and Fran Drescher), and a morning show.  He discussed a Henry Phillips song about school shootings played on Raw Dog, leading to a listener complaint.  Several callers participated, including John from Tennessee, Mike from Philadelphia (who discussed the controversy surrounding the school shooting song), Joe from Pennsylvania (who engaged in a racially charged exchange with Sam), Mark (who mentioned Who Kid stealing his Christmas presents), and Rich (who requested a signed item from Who Kid). A significant portion detailed a disastrous Vegas trip with Roland and Troy, culminating in Roland's attempt to run through the Bellagio fountain and Troy's extreme FOMO. Joe DeRosa called in to recount a near-fire incident involving Roland and a tea-light candle.  DJ Who Kid also appeared, discussing his upcoming appearances and the YouTube rapper Krispy Kreme.  Samâ€™s upcoming appearance on Michael Cole and JBL's web show was also mentioned. Throughout the after-show, numerous racial slurs and other offensive language were used.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd, and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m., and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fledgling.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  ONA every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Rules are destroyed.  And convention burns the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie.  The Destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  Why does it smell too bad?  Anthony.  The Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted?  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton. 
[00:01:30]  Lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning, everybody.  Last show of the year, huh?  Last live show of the year.  Whoa.  Wow. 
[00:02:00]  Weird.  Of course that happened.  You all right?  Yeah, but I can't.  Okay.  I'm good.  Mars has been gone for about two weeks, so a few things have been a little messed up.  A little amiss.  I asked about this screen, I don't know, five days ago.  Oh, the EROC screen?  Yeah.  Is the Radio Wizard on that?  I haven't heard, no, I haven't heard anything about that.  Is he even aware?  He may not be, no.  He's still not aware of that either, huh? 
[00:02:30]  The wall thing?  Yeah.  No.  That we pointed out saying, let's see how long it takes for him to fix that.  It just looks shoddy.  I mean, it wasn't brought up at the final meeting of the year.  We got this black shit that's covering up some Bay shit.  Right.  And the black shit is kind of like falling off the wall.  It's been falling off the wall for months.  And kind of as a little gag, we said, let's see how long it takes the Radio Wizard, the  guy that's supposed to be taking care of everything for us, notices it and fixes it. 
[00:03:00]  No, there's been more of a focus on cleaning up the offices.  Oh, wow.  That's exciting.  Yeah.  That's just a little behind-the-scenes dirt for you guys.  Oh, nice.  I like it.  Who gives a fuck about the screen that is kind of important to see what the fuck's going  on in the other room?  Maybe they thought they'd get you because the end of the world was coming.  They figured, you know, why fix it if, you know, the end of the world.  I've survived officially three end of the worlds. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  I think I'm up to three end of the worlds I've survived.  Right.  Is that a record?  Do I get the record?  Three end of the worlds.  I know we had that one.  It was an end of the world.  I don't know.  Wasn't there one where it was a mate thing?  Like, remember that whacked out guy?  Yeah, that crazy guy.  We've already forgotten about already.  Yeah.  But he got a lot of media attention.  Then he changed his date, right?  Didn't he say all that was a mistake?  Then he changed his date, so that's another end of the world.  This is the third.  I got at least three end of the worlds I've survived. 
[00:04:00]  And I'm sure there has been a few others.  A Y2K.  Y2K.  That's my fourth end of the world I survived.  You did survive the Y2K.  You might not have survived today yet.  Pepper Hicks told me that 11-11 is the time.  11-11 or 6-11, I heard.  Oh, shit.  Pepper told me 11-11 a.m.  11-11.  Did it say in the Mayan calendar, 11-11?  Like, what zone?  What time zone?  Oh, I mean...  Oh, don't get into that.  I know.  Because yesterday I said Mayans.  Epic fail.  Oh! 
[00:04:30]  That's what I heard.  I'm like, they said the end of the world.  That means they're talking about the world.  The world.  So that means, you know, the 21st started already somewhere else.  Right.  Thus then, fuck you.  I'm going to say that a lot more next year because it's a joke.  What did they say?  Uh, uh!  They corrected you?  I corrected you.  One idiot goes, hey, dope, it's not the 21st yet. 
[00:05:00]  I go, yes, it is, you dope.  Because if the Mayans are talking about the world, that means the world.  Right.  We like to think the whole world lives in our dumb time zone, but the fact is, if you're  talking about the end of the world, where's the 21st?  Well, it started, what, in Australia?  Australia.  Or fucking Japan?  Yeah.  Or whatever the fuck?  Somewhere far away from here.  They're already, uh, they've already celebrated Christmas.  They're so far ahead of us.  Oh, it's done.  It's amazing.  So guess what?  There's no end of the world shit.  It is raining hard.  Huh? 
[00:05:30]  It is raining hard.  It is kind of creepy in New York with that set.  Let's see that.  A little fucking, uh, windy.  My whole fucking apartment was creaking last night.  I thought ghosts were walking around.  You know what that is?  Huh?  That's the end of the world.  Well, when you wake up and you hear all this, like, creaking, like the floorboards, like  someone's walking, you're like, all right, who the fuck's in my apartment?  And then you realize that a building's fucking moving in.  You're fucking hundreds of feet in the air.  500-ish.  Cloud City.  500-ish.  I don't know.  500-ish.  Do you remember when we were, uh, did you do that thing when you were a kid where they 
[00:06:00]  would, somebody would tell you like this, oh, I got a story to tell you.  And the story was, uh, some, there's some long story about how there was a, uh, a dead  lady and, uh, the, the name Mary, the girl's name was Mary and the mother was.  It's always Mary.  I don't know why.  There's one of those out on Long Island too, walking around a graveyard or something.  But then you tell the story and it's like the, like the person's coming for Mary.  Right.  And, uh, do you, do you notice when Mary, I'm on the first step.  Oh.  Like walking up the steps to your house.  Oh no, that's creepy. 
[00:06:30]  Um, and Mary, I'm on the second step.  And I don't know what else was happening.  Oh.  But I just remember Mary, I'm on the third step and then you're listening and they go,  and I got you.  And that's the end of the story.  Mary opens the door and goes, hi, daddy.  And I go, Mary.  And I go, trim that pussy.  Oh.  So damn hairy.  I love this.  That's a good story.  That's very scary.  No, it's a great story.  I wish I would know the story.  I would have told it.  It would have killed a good eight minutes. 
[00:07:00]  So, the end of the world thing's a bust.  Although it's a little creepy in New York today.  Yeah.  It's kind of a bit sideways.  Yeah, it's windy.  And then I think it's going to snow a little later.  Right.  Is it really?  Or they, they always say shit like that and then they go, north and west of our area.  Right.  In our listening area, we could get snow north and west.  It's just a bust.  We've spent two or three years getting to this day.  Yeah.  Nothing.  At least an earthquake or something would be fun just to kind of.  Yeah.  Shake things up.  Yeah.  Shake things up a little bit. 
[00:07:30]  I like to spell that.  That's great.  They get so fucked.  Oh, dopes.  They just suck.  Oh, most of you don't, but there are people that just really, really need to get a life  at this point.  Oh, my God.  Really.  Just move on, you idiots.  I've had it.  Some of these people.  Ah! 
[00:08:00]  Last show of the year, we got Christmas cookies from Sam Roberts' mom.  I know.  I saw that.  Can I see those cookies?  You can see them from where you are.  Not really.  I can't see right now.  Oh, yeah.  Those weren't that good last year.  They were.  Yes, they were.  They were all right.  Remember that.  Last year, there was a little drop off.  Oh, my God.  I can't believe she even did it.  Why?  Why would she call me and all that?  You want me to make cookies for everybody?  Oh, okay.  I'm driving to your apartment.  It's kind of creepy because they're like perfect.  Of course they are.  And she gets like the cellophane, the festive cellophane to put over it. 
[00:08:30]  Like you bought that at a store.  Hand-tied ribbons.  Oh.  With love.  Tied with love.  What kind of cookies are in there?  Yeah.  Any peanut butter cookies?  I don't know.  There's peanut butter stuff.  There's fudge.  What do you mean peanut butter stuff?  What kind of peanut butter stuff?  I said, I don't know.  Is it in a cookie form?  I just said, I don't know.  Or is it homemade Reese's?  No.  Is it Reese's or Reese's?  Reese's.  Reese's.  I always fuck that one up too.  Reese's. 
[00:09:00]  Peanut butter cups.  It's Reese, but it's possessive.  Reese's.  I get a niece named Reese.  Yeah.  It's her peanut butter cup.  Guess what she gets every birthday.  Ah.  Peanut butter cups.  A lot of original people in my family.  Very funny.  I bet I'll be the only one.  I'll be the only one.  I'll buy a giant one this year.  I'm doing voices in 2013.  Fuck it.  Ooh.  It's time. 
[00:09:30]  A preview.  There's some cookies and fudge and pecan tarts.  Oh, God.  Pecans.  Pecans.  Pecans sucks.  We say it every year.  Pecans stink.  Do you like them in pumpkin pie?  No.  Pecans.  I like pecan pie.  It's a little pecan pie.  I hate the word pecan, though.  I hate it, too.  Pecans in the nut family, right?  It's a nut.  All right.  Well, there's a lot, much better nuts than pecan.  Not to make a pie out of.  You're going to make a peanut pie.  The almonds are better.  You're going to make an almond pie?  Regular peanuts are better.  What about a good filbert?  You can make an almond pie, or you just make a nice lime pie, and you throw some almonds 
[00:10:00]  on it, and you go, what do you know?  What do you think?  Pecans suck, because they've got to sugar that shit up.  They know they suck.  I mean, they're nuts.  They're not sweet.  Yeah, but other nuts you could just eat.  They're fine.  Nuts shouldn't be on anything sweet.  I mean, I'm not a nut guy.  Except the pussy, right?  Yeah.  There you go, Jim.  Fucking right.  You're all man.  Ah, well, the end of the world. 
[00:10:30]  I think we're safe on that one, right?  Yeah.  Big story, though, man.  We got a former Olympic track star that was escorting.  Does that make your fucking penis hard job?  My heart is fluttering reading this.  Really?  Why?  It's turning me on so much.  To know that she's just a bad girl.  Yeah, but she was a $600 an hour girl.  I never would have got her anyway.  No?  Nah, unless I knew who she was, but I would never go for just a $600 an hour girl.  That doesn't seem like a lot.  Do you have to do a two, three hour minimum or something? 
[00:11:00]  That's a lot.  Yeah.  I don't spend that kind of money.  No.  Are you with an Olympic athlete?  But if I...  That's what I'm saying.  She didn't list herself as that.  She was just a pretty girl.  Look at her ad.  Look at her ass in the post.  Great legs.  Look at this.  That was her ad, the top...  How fucking hot is that?  I know, but her face is a little rough.  She didn't show her face in the ad.  Well, good for her.  Or she would have been a $200 a fucking hour call girl.  Well, she's 44 now, too.  She's also a little older.  Some say she won a gold medal.  I don't think she did.  No, I've never heard of her.  Well, then MSNBC fucking had the wrong info as I'm sitting here today.  Oh, wow.  Go figure. 
[00:11:30]  The Daily News on your market said ho.  Oh, nice.  You can see on the cover, they got her little ad in the bottom there.  Right.  I'm all over this one.  All sexy and shit.  And look at her cooking.  She had like a cooking thing she did.  That's what turned me on is the fact that she probably had this...  She probably has a nice pussy, a nice Olympic pussy.  What do you think that's about?  She's saying that...  Her husband knew.  Yeah.  Well, and her husband was trying to make her stop.  Her husband knew, but he wasn't into it.  He wasn't one of those guys.  Wow.  I don't know, because why would she do it?  I don't buy that the husband wasn't into it. 
[00:12:00]  I think that she's protecting him.  Maybe they needed the money.  Screw the Olympic legacy and Nike commercial.  I was a $600 an hour call girl.  Wow.  Dude, this is driving me berserk, this story.  Susie Favor Hamilton, a three-time U.S. Olympian in middle distance running.  Middle distance is that weird distance.  It's, I don't know.  In the middle?  Yeah, it's like those 10-mile races and stuff.  Yeah.  I think it's like, whatever, who cares.  Spent the last year working as a call girl for Haley Heston's private collection. 
[00:12:30]  It's a premier escort service based in Las Vegas.  44-year-old wife and mother used the alias Kelly Lundy to snuggle with men in swanky hotels.  Snuggle.  From Los Angeles to Chicago.  And we couldn't, you want me to read every single word?  How much was she?  $600 an hour.  $600 an hour.  Is that a lot?  And Jimmy, you didn't treat yourself at any time?  If I knew it was her, I mean, ever.  You've never treated yourself to like a real high angle. 
[00:13:00]  No, you've done $600.  I've done more.  You've talked about it on the show.  Yeah, I did $1,000 once.  Oh.  What did you get for $1,000?  What did I get you?  It was just a woman who I had really wanted to fuck, and I did.  And she wanted normally more.  She normally goes for more.  Oh, you got a discount.  I think I got like $500 off.  How long did you last?  Not that long.  No, I...  Fuck, man.  Not a long time.  But it was hot eating her, going down on her.  Fuck you.  But this was one, though.  That's something...  That's a quick thousand. 
[00:13:30]  I said to myself...  Did you regret it as soon as you came?  No.  No.  Because I held out and hadn't done it in a long...  Like, I never did it.  I wanted to with this one, and I just didn't for like a year and a half or two years.  I'm like, no way.  And then I'm like, fuck it.  Just do it once.  And I did.  I would love to do it again, but it's been a long time since I've done it.  I mean, I can't...  I don't remember how long it was.  Was she hot?  Yeah.  She had to be hot for a thousand years.  And her body was just these long legs, juicy.  Like, she was fucking...  She's a real escort.  Like, escorts like that are so much... 
[00:14:00]  There's a different vibe to them.  Um...  They don't have that distance there?  No.  A lot of times they kiss you.  Like, it's like a real date.  But it's just...  Again, that was the time I had a little bit of extra money.  I can't see myself doing that unless it's a tremendous one that I have to...  It's like a bucket list type chick.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just not worth it because three or four hundred bucks is even a lot because of...  Like, I don't...  Really?  Yeah, man.  You...  Can I do it...  You know?  You don't want to fucking lose your home for getting hoarse. 
[00:14:30]  But what are you getting for like a hundred?  I wouldn't do that.  I honestly wouldn't.  You're getting...  Two hundred.  What's your lowest?  Um...  For a hundred or two hundred, you're probably getting...  It's probably a massage type thing with a hand release of some sort.  And you may be able to talk them into more.  But, um...  Sometimes you'll get regular girls.  Handjobs are just silly.  You know what, though?  They can get me off at times.  They can.  What the...  Hmm.  Yeah.  This is silly. 
[00:15:00]  A good handy.  With a twist.  Ugh.  I like a soft handjob.  I don't like it when they do it too roughly because they saw it in a movie.  Like, some of the girls I've gotten it from, they'll like, touch your balls lightly and  slowly jerk you.  Like, there are girls that really know how to just milk your dick.  I've seen videos.  They're amazing.  Girls like using just her thumb, barely moving it.  And the guy's like, brr!  Well, that's...  Brr!  Um, alright.  Uh, but her double life imploded after revealing her identity to several clients. 
[00:15:30]  Why would she do that?  I have a theory.  I think she wants to write a book.  Really?  Yep.  I think she's writing a book.  And I think this came out on purpose.  Okay.  Mmm.  Uh, who excitedly gushed to their friends about betting a former Olympian and model.  A reporter caught up with Hamilton in a Las Vegas hotel lobby earlier this month.  She reluctantly spilled about her astounding secret she now calls a huge mistake.  You know, I don't think she thinks it's a huge mistake, right?  No.  I cannot emphasize enough how sorry I am to anyone I have hurt as a result of my actions 
[00:16:00]  and greatly appreciate the support from family and those closest to me.  I fully intend to make amends and get back to being a good mother, wife, daughter, and  friend, Hamilton tweeted today.  Hamilton lives in Wisconsin with her seven-year-old daughter and her college sweetheart.  Just because you go out with someone in college doesn't mean it's your fucking sweetheart.  They have to say that every time.  Yeah.  Uh, she said her husband knew of her salacious shenanigans, but he just couldn't stop her.  See, that's the part that I have trouble believing because she, either she's a drug addict or a sex addict. 
[00:16:30]  I mean, obviously there's a reason for this, but when they said that she started in December of 11,  so maybe she's just having these, I'm an older woman losing everything.  Oh, she just did this last year.  I believe so.  A quick year.  The former swimsuit model gushes her secret sex life was exciting.  A welcome diversion from heading her successful real estate brokerage company, delivering  60 motivational speeches a year, and heading up promotional work for Disney.  So she was making pretty good money, it seems. 
[00:17:00]  Dude, how hot is that?  How fucking hot is that?  This girl was doing legit stuff.  That's like what's getting you?  Yes, the fact that she was doing this, she had this business and there was this-  That she couldn't help herself?  This private- because it gives you faith in every woman you meet, like, no matter who you  see around the office, no matter who you see, they can have that other side.  Like, that turns me on so much as that dirty, dirty secret of it.  Mm-hmm.  Makes it so hot to me.  Ooh.  I'd easily spend $600 if I knew she was.  Well, she says, I was drawn to escorting in large part because it provided many coping 
[00:17:30]  mechanisms for me when I was going through a very challenging time with my marriage and  my life.  It provided an escape from a life that I was struggling in.  It was a double life.  Oh, double life.  I do not expect people to understand, but the reasons for doing this made sense to me  at the time and were very much related to depression.  See, this is now the-  She's on the healing road.  Like, this is the redemption.  Like, I do think that she'll write a book about it and I think this came out on purpose 
[00:18:00]  because you don't tell people you're an Olympic athlete for no reason unless you want the  story out.  You're not dumb.  Nobody recognized her, obviously.  She had to tell them.  Right.  If somebody recognized her, I'd go, oh, wow.  Well, that's- She wanted this out.  She wasn't- Well, but she was in Nike commercials and she's one of the most successful female  athletes in NCAA track and field history.  Oh, dude, you're just driving me crazy.  I just want to-  She was an amazing college athlete.  She ran in the 92, 96, and 2000 Olympics, but I don't think she medaled. 
[00:18:30]  I really don't think she medaled.  Yeah, she minded her own business, which I respect.  But she claimed her life turned sour after suffering from postpartum depression following  her daughter's birth in 2005.  Hamilton said she also struggled with her brother's suicide a year before she sprinted  in the 1500-meter final in Sydney.  She said she threw the race once she knew she couldn't score a medal, horrified she could  not honor her brother's memory.  So this all leads to hooking?  Yeah, right?  That mind is a weird fucking thing, huh? 
[00:19:00]  I don't believe that her husband couldn't stop her, though, because you don't tolerate  your wife jetting to Vegas.  And although she may have been gone for speaking engagements, too.  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe he busted her and then she's like, I won't do it anymore, but then still did it  under another name when she was-  Yeah, maybe that's true.  Okay.  I've been seeking the help of a psychologist for the past few weeks and will continue to  do so after I have put things back together.  She said she decided to quit the escort business, though several of her clients tell the site she  is worth every penny.  Wow. 
[00:19:30]  I would see her in a second.  I would see her.  Imagine that fucking, how fucking she could work that thing.  She's older, though.  All those muscles.  Which is not my, a $600 escort is 44, but you'd never hear me order a nut.  No.  No.  No.  She's got those rough hand ligaments.  Yeah.  She is pretty lean.  Yeah.  She probably could squeeze your dick pretty good.  Yeah.  I mean, not too far between.  Squeeze that shit.  But that's where it's freaked me out a little bit anyway. 
[00:20:00]  Like, I don't go out and get the ones that fuck.  Like, I don't, because there's too much you can catch.  It just scares me.  It really does scare me.  Yeah?  Yeah, man.  It's like, you gotta be careful.  So what do you usually, like, in handies?  Yeah, sometimes.  Finger in your ass?  Sometimes, yeah.  Or a lot of times, nothing.  You'd be most things, I literally, I've gotten, like, I go to, like, massage places and stuff,  and I get really, nothing happens.  Huh.  It was just the idea of it.  It's interesting.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it's weird.  It's like, then I go home, and I just, like, I think I'm gonna jerk off, but I don't.  I'm a weirdo.  I've gotten to be a weirdo, but I've actually mellowed as far as risk-taking in my older days. 
[00:20:30]  Oh, look at you.  Just a very, very low-risk shit in my life.  Hmm.  Because I'm just starting to get nervous.  Like, I've been lucky for too long.  Like, something, something, nothing really bad has happened, and when it does, it's  gonna be a bad one.  Like, I'm gonna knock her up, and she's gonna have four kids, and they're all gonna have  AIDS, and give it to me.  Oh, my God!  Like, something, like, I'm gonna fucking, fucking 20 years of karma is gonna just get  me in the fucking stomach.  Oh, my God, that's horrific now.  Holy shit.  So that's a big story today. 
[00:21:00]  Big story.  That's hot, though, man.  Look at her cooking.  Did you see that picture of her cooking, dude?  That's fucking great.  That's hot.  That's a cooking show, yeah.  Yeah.  Why is the cooking picture hot?  Because it shows you...  Shows that she's a homebody?  That's...  No, no, no, it's not...  It's her cooking on a set.  It looks like she's cooking, uh...  Um...  She's doing, like, a Martha Stewart kind of a thing.  Yeah, it was, like, a picture...  Try to find a hot picture of her.  See, her face is rough, man.  Yeah, it is, but it's more the scenario. 
[00:21:30]  The body's, uh, definitely banging.  Yikes.  What about the bikini picture?  Yeah, the red, white...  Let me see, Sammy.  Sammy!  Not bad.  Oh, come on.  That's...  Look at that body on her.  No, the body's amazing.  But face's a little rough.  It's a little Dolph Lundgren-ish, but I mean...  Give me one more.  Can you find a good face picture somewhere?  That's now.  Let me see.  I mean, she's not ugly, certainly.  Uh-uh.  That turns me on. 
[00:22:00]  Uh-uh.  Yeah.  Fuck, dude.  I like when I know about them in real life.  Yeah.  That always turns me on, when I would know about them in real life, because...  You know, there are people, and it's like, when people come over to your house, or you go  to them, it's just you're seeing these sexual things.  I want to, like, know what they do, for real, you know?  A lot of them don't want to tell you, but...  Yeah.  So, well...  It's hot to know that.  Yeah.  Like, you know more about that person in 45 minutes than people that they've known for 
[00:22:30]  20 years.  And that's what the dirty secret is about it, is, like, people who fucked her knew more  about her than her Olympic teammates, who traveled the world with her.  In 40 minutes, they learn more about her, that fucking underbelly, than that, to me,  is the sexy part.  I'm babbling.  You think she liked it?  You think she enjoyed it?  I'm just sorry.  They cannot stop showing this kid's picture in the fucking post. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  They cannot stop showing his photo.  Yeah.  And that absolutely will make someone else think twice about it.  Wow.  I have no doubt about it.  These pictures of these children are fucking...  It's depressing me so much.  I was reading last night how I didn't realize that some of the kids were hiding.  It's the most horrific thing you could ever imagine.  And the teacher, who they called a hero, she made all the kids hide in the fucking classroom,  and this fucking animal comes in, and he goes, where?  I guess he demanded to know where they are. 
[00:23:30]  And she goes, uh...  They're down the hall in the auditorium.  And I guess that he waited there or something.  I don't know what happened.  And then a few of the kids panicked and ran out, and he shot.  It just fucking...  It's terrible.  And they just keep showing his fucking face, and it's really annoying me.  Creep.  And the media has no responsibility as far as that goes.  And that's where guys...  I mean, Piers is demanding, you know, people answer his questions, but I asked a simple  question to that guy, you know?  The media is a much bigger part of this.  Look, man, I said it the other day. 
[00:24:00]  If you know more about this kid than Mick Jagger, it's absolutely a problem.  We live in a culture where everybody wants to be famous.  Every single person wants to be famous.  That's why Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and the rest of them are just taking off.  Yeah, it gives you a form.  Because everyone's getting a little taste of fame.  Yeah.  Of course this influences others.  Of course it does.  You're hobnobbing with celebrities on Twitter.  You know, shit like that.  Right.  Yeah.  Of course.  Kind of almost famous. 
[00:24:30]  Famous, and then...  And I do think violent video games and some violent movies also influence.  But I also think it's the other side of it that, you know, it also calms people the fuck  down.  Yeah, I think that's inconsequential.  You're never going to get a perfect stat.  Mm-hmm.  You know?  But I think this is way more influential than any of that horse shit they're talking about  on TV.  Yeah.  When you show his picture every fucking day, that's giving other lonely kids some ideas. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  If you're going to kill yourself, why wouldn't you do something like this?  Absolutely.  You just look in the paper and see all the recognition you get.  Mm-hmm.  It's stupid.  Dumb fucking news.  I'm so glad him and his dumb fucking mother are dead.  Oh, am I so glad.  Yeah, that mother really is a lump of shit.  Ugh.  I'm glad the mom's dead, too.  Yes.  Fuck her.  A lot of people feel in bed for that mother.  No.  Fuck her.  I'm glad the mother's dead. 
[00:25:30]  Fuck her.  Yeah, she was horrendous.  She knew this kid was a fucking maniac and she left guns around the house.  She knew she had a dud fall out of her box.  She fucking ventilates her head good.  And then she takes off for a few days, just leaving him in the house.  With guns!  With the fucking guns!  Gummy.  Yeah.  It's unfortunate that he didn't just shoot her and then himself.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  Fucking awful.  Just find the two of them in a fucking pile in her dumb bedroom.  That would have been good.  That would have been great.  A little footnote story somewhere we would have forgotten about already. 
[00:26:00]  I don't know.  I saw more six and seven-year-olds yesterday.  I can't look at six and seven-year-olds.  It goes right to the fucking pain, you feel, about this thing.  Because you just start imagining all sorts of shit.  And then their little voices start talking.  Oh.  Because that was the age.  Six, seven.  See them every day.  They were walking out of a school yesterday.  And it drives me insane. 
[00:26:30]  It's terrible.  It's horrendous.  What are they doing today?  A little moment of silence or something?  Is that it?  Ringing some bells.  Got some bell ringing today.  What are we doing?  I reckon.  Yeah, doing something like that.  And then the NRA, I guess, has a statement this morning.  What time are they doing that?  10-something, 11-something?  I know the media is also trying to spin positive things coming out of this.  There's absolutely no positives.  Zero positive. 
[00:27:00]  None.  They're showing 26 Christmas trees.  That's all nice and well and good.  And maybe it helps the family slightly.  I would say ever so slightly.  But there's no good coming out of this.  There's no positive.  Like, oh, you know.  This is as bad as it gets.  As far as America goes.  Because we don't know what the fuck's going on with the rest of the world.  Well.  Focusing on the victims and showing everybody these children is one thing.  Like, I think people like to know that the country's grieving with them.  I don't mind them focusing on the victims. 
[00:27:30]  But the scumbags on the news have to fucking go through their last day.  What purpose does that serve?  Yeah.  Yeah, it's just funny.  One father's going, oh, you know, she was learning Portuguese.  And we did a little Portuguese back and forth.  See, I know this shit.  I do watch.  And then she said, goodbye, daddy.  Love you in Portuguese.  And that was the last I ever saw her.  I'm like, do we really need to know what her last day was?  That's horrendous.  Yeah, it's terrible. 
[00:28:00]  Talk about everything else about her life.  It's just awful.  Awful.  And they know they're contributing to it.  They know.  And they don't.  Yeah, that's why Pierce didn't answer my question.  He knows.  Yeah.  He fucking knows.  Not acknowledged by any of them.  As he's sitting there being all pissed off and outraged because people aren't answering his questions.  Well, they do that story.  Which are way more complicated than my stupid, and it was a stupid, simple question. 
[00:28:30]  They won't do the story.  Does the news contribute to mass shootings?  Tune in at 11 when we go in depth with this.  I've never heard them actually acknowledge that that even might be an issue.  Disprove it.  24-hour news cycles where you're showing the guy's picture.  By the way, I'm proud of this show because we didn't mention his name once.  Yeah, fuck him.  Absolutely contributes to this.  Absolutely. 
[00:29:00]  Abso-fucking-lily.  That one, I would say, is a guarantee.  Video games and all that, certainly let's debate that.  But 24-hour news cycle, I don't need to debate that one.  Without a doubt.  That's pretty obvious.  And they don't ask the...  Instead of saying the media, what they should say is, what do we as the media...  How about you fucking put we in there?  Yeah.  How do we in the media contribute to this?  What is our part in this?  Unless, of course, all these profilers and the FBI profilers, you know, these guys that 
[00:29:30]  can pick out a serial killer's fucking, his favorite brand of oat muffin before we catch  him.  Yeah, yeah.  By the way, the body is splayed.  They're telling us that this contributes.  Yeah.  And we, the press, are purposefully ignoring it.  They're not innocent about this.  They know it.  This is a huge moneymaker for 24-hour news cycles.  Oh, yeah.  Huge moneymaker.  Viewership's up, and they're able to sell their commercials. 
[00:30:00]  Secretly, if you want a taste of honesty, they kind of hope this shit happens.  Sorry.  They do.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they don't know these people in the end.  They kind of hope this shit happens.  They love big news, regardless of what it is.  Right.  That's their bread and butter.  Oh, well, that's outrageous.  Is it?  Is that outrageous?  And they don't even know it.  They don't even admit it to themselves.  Like, they never have moments where they go, hey, I'm glad this happened.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't say it, but it is the way they behave.  They know. 
[00:30:30]  They walk around those places, and they look at each other like, here we go.  Here we go.  They rub their hands together like, this is good for business.  Yeah.  Guy in Cincinnati has a very good question.  Guy, what's up?  Guy.  Hey, what's up, ONA and Jimmy?  Hi, buddy.  What's up, Guy?  Yeah, my question is, do these guys, if they're going in to be famous, why do they take their  life, or they never get to see themselves on television, to be famous?  They just want to be, you know what it is? 
[00:31:00]  I think they're going out as legends.  Like, that's in their, of course, in their minds.  We're going to go out, because they, I'll tell you why.  This goes right to the press.  Because they know they're going to be famous, because they see how the press covers these  other people once they're dead.  Right.  And they know that they're going to kill themselves anyway, so they're like, I'm going out in  a blaze of glory, and they probably think, I'm going to be infamous, I'm going to live  on in some way, because they've seen the way these fucking pigs in the press cover them 
[00:31:30]  and make them anti-heroes.  If it wasn't for that, if they just did a quick blurb on them and said, the shooter,  and they concentrated on what an outcast he was, not a maniac, but a lonely, fucking  socially worthless outcast, they might not do it.  You know how pathetic they are?  They're now talking to the kid's barber.  What?  The guy that cut his hair.  Jesus.  There was a whole interview about that.  That's fucking ridiculous.  I'd love to know the revenue and the stocks that go up for CNN and Fox during these tragedies 
[00:32:00]  for this week-long, just how much more money is made.  Well, basically, it breaks down to this, because it happens on radio.  You get a lot more viewers because of the big event, and then they could sell ads based  on that down the road a little bit.  Well, thanks, guys.  And, Jimmy, if you're ever in Cincinnati, I can hook you up with some $20 crack horse.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:32:30]  All right, sir.  Nice offer.  Yeah, you don't need to be hooked up with them.  Just point them out.  I can take care of the business myself.  He's really helping you out.  Yeah.  Thanks.  You know what?  I'm not a huge fan of Piers Morgan, that hothead.  Yeah.  Dylan, go ahead.  But I will defend Piers Morgan on Dylan's point.  Go ahead, Dylan.  Hey, what was Piers Morgan thinking when he told the rifle guy or the NRA guy or whichever,  I can't really remember exactly what he was doing on there, what that guy's title was, 
[00:33:00]  but what was he thinking when he told that guy or asked him the question of, oh, so you  enjoy seeing this happen, or you gun people like seeing this happen?  What was that all about?  Like, what kind of explanation was he expecting there?  You're like, nobody likes fucking seeing this happen?  I thought you were going to talk about his tweet where it was very sarcastic.  Yeah.  But everyone tried to make a big deal about it. 
[00:33:30]  Like, he meant what he tweeted.  What did he say?  Someone basically said, you know, do you enjoy what happened or whatever.  Yeah, of course I do.  Or something like that.  And it was obviously, he was being completely sarcastic.  Yeah.  Yeah, I hear you there.  Well, that's just Piers being a hothead.  I thought you were talking about the other one.  So, you know, yeah, of course, that's a loaded, it's called the loaded question.  Okay.  Of course, the guy doesn't, you know, like what happened. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, Jesus.  Piers Morgan's a piece of shit.  He's a hothead.  He's just a hothead.  And he's very easy to get to on Twitter.  It's a lot of fun.  I see everyone else get to him as well.  It's fun.  Yeah.  Did he actually respond to your questions and stuff?  Because I saw you tweet.  Well, we went back and forth for a couple hours.  Then he gave me some weird answer that had nothing to do with my question.  But since then, I've seen other people get to him with just really easy tweets.  Well, that's the thing.  You couldn't get to your question or you couldn't answer your question just like you couldn't answer half that guy's questions he was asking. 
[00:34:30]  And my guy was making Piers Morgan his bitch for sure.  Piers was very unprofessional as far as an interview goes with that guy.  He was just calling him names, taking his point.  You're stupid.  Yeah, yeah.  The guy was making such valid points and Piers was just, oh, right, well, whatever.  Thank you, sir.  Piers was just like totally just saying, ah, yeah, what you're saying is shit and you're stupid. 
[00:35:00]  That's not how you interview somebody.  No.  It's an emotionally really brutal issue for everybody.  Exactly.  And one thing I like about Piers, even though I think that is unprofessional, is at least you know.  Yes, because I like to stand on the end.  His imports are marvelous.  I like to look, too.  I also Piers at times.  But at least, like, you know, he really believes what he's saying.  Like, he's, I'm not going to say coming from the gut, but I don't think he's being a phony. 
[00:35:30]  Like, I think that when you're allowing your emotion to come out that much as an interviewer, I don't think it's good.  I don't think it's good either.  But I will say at least he's not being a complete fraud.  Like, he really thinks this.  Yeah.  Otherwise, he wouldn't get so hot about it.  Yeah.  I always find it weird when somebody from England, or especially the Canadians, are chiming in a lot about this whole thing.  When they start jumping on with their viewpoints of what should happen in this country,  when they really don't completely understand what it's like to not only be an American, 
[00:36:00]  but understand our rules and our rights and the Constitution.  They just don't seem to...  How long has Piers been in America full time?  Since the show started, right?  I'm not sure.  I don't think he really lived here a lot before that.  No.  So you get this emotional thing that kind of pushes the facts and all the other things out of the way.  You can't just say, oh, well, there's no need for guns or anything. 
[00:36:30]  Well, you know what?  The Constitution has spelt out that there is a need, so you can't just emotionally say get rid of them.  You know what?  Because what you just said is why the rest of the world hates us.  Yeah.  In that moment, like, you know how annoying it is just to have somebody from Canada or Pierce or England commenting on our country?  Yeah.  All we do is put our nose into everybody else's business.  Oh, I do understand that.  Like, can you imagine having fucking foreign soldiers on your base or on your land or your fucking... 
[00:37:00]  The U.S. government always poking and poking and poking and poking and poking and poking?  Are we poking our schnozzle in?  They're always meddling, nosy Aunt USA.  The rest of the world would hate...  That's why they hate our guts.  Because we're always in the...  Like, I get annoyed when they comment on our fucking culture.  It's like, oh, fuck yourself.  I do kind of feel like we're...  You know how in the bad neighborhoods the police are always looked at like the bad guys and  they throw shit at them and shoot at them and things like that? 
[00:37:30]  Sure.  Yet, they are the people that are calling the police most to fix their shit.  But that's how I think the United States is viewed in the eyes of the world also.  Oh, you guys are assholes.  You're pieces of shit.  And then the second something happens, they're like, ah, help!  Ah!  You know, obviously we stick our nose into places we shouldn't.  I understand that.  But then don't fucking go yelling for our help when shit happens in your country. 
[00:38:00]  I agree.  Yeah.  I agree.  Nothing's going to be solved.  Nah, we'll see.  Like I said, the NRA is going to speak this morning.  What time are they speaking?  I'm not sure.  I think this morning sometime, 9, 10, maybe even 11.  I'm not sure.  Let's see what they have to say.  And then Andrew Cuomo is talking about some really strict new gun control measures for New  York State.  The Bloomberg as well.  Yeah, which already has really strict gun laws.  There's still an assault weapon ban in New York. 
[00:38:30]  Like, it was lifted federally.  But in New York, there's still certain guns you're not allowed to possess that are considered  assault weapons.  No, New York State as a whole.  All of New York State.  Yeah.  And now they want it to get magazine size from 10 rounds down to 7 rounds, I think is what  he's saying.  Again, I honestly don't think that a person that wants to bust in and kill a bunch of  people is going to adhere to the magazine capacity rule.  Right.  I think they're going to grab 30 round magazines, load them up, and shoot people with them. 
[00:39:00]  But, you know, regardless.  All right.  Well, irregardless.  Food's here.  Nice.  Food!  All right.  Wow.  I just learned about the pecan.  Oh, you're learning about the pecan.  Well, do tell.  Melvin Tillis, it looks like, on the old Twitter.  Mel Tillis?  Melvin Tillis.  Or Melvin Tillis.  I don't know, man.  You've got to make your Twitter names easier if you want the big plug.  That's a stuttering country singer guy? 
[00:39:30]  Of course it is, yes.  He writes, the pecan is not a nut.  Oh, what is it?  I swear to God, until this moment, I thought it was a nut.  It's a droop.  A what?  It's a droop.  What's a droop?  A droop?  Are we all learning this for the first time?  What the fuck is a droop?  I've never heard of droops before.  That's a nut with Asperger's.  It's a droop.  D-R-U-P-E, if you want to look it up.  It's a fruit with a single stone or pit surrounded by a husk. 
[00:40:00]  It's a fucking nut.  That's a nut.  That's like saying tomatoes aren't fucking vegetables.  Shut up.  Tomatoes are fruit.  Yeah, it's a vegetable.  I don't give a fuck what science says.  I got a fruit salad.  They don't put tomatoes in it.  Exactly.  You ever cut tomatoes up over your fucking Apple Jacks?  Oh, my, I want some tomatoes and McCurn Flakes, my.  That would suck.  A bunch of those dumb gooey seeds in your cereal.  How much would tomatoes wreck your fucking Kern Flakes? 
[00:40:30]  Your Kern Flakes.  Just make it a fucking vegetable.  We all know it is.  Exactly.  Enough with that shit.  A droop.  What's a droop?  What else could we...  Oh, it's a nut that had a stroke.  It's a Bell's palsy nut.  Nuts versus droops.  There's a whole article on it.  Name some of those other droops.  Betty White's tits.  What about the walnut?  It's a droop.  The walnut's not a droop, right? 
[00:41:00]  No, the walnut's probably a nut.  All right, good.  It has nut in its name.  It's not called a wall droop.  That's right.  I understand it has nut in its name.  I always liked Pecani Dog.  Oh, what happened?  Is my mic on?  No.  Is the plug out?  You know what?  Oh, God.  What the...  That cord is...  Oh, that's good.  This channel had a bad week. 
[00:41:30]  Now I'm hearing like...  Not us, but just like...  I guess Gary started his vacation earlier or something, Sam?  Can an engineer come in here and replace Jimmy's cord?  Yeah, please.  It's a bad cord.  You can leave your train outside.  Walk right in.  He comes in with an oil can.  Oils your microphone.  Why would he do that?  Oh, you know what?  A peach is a droop.  I was going to ask if a peach was a droop.  A peach is a fruit.  I was on Opie's description of a droop.  A nectarine.  I love a good nectarine. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah, nectarine.  Are they fruits and droops?  No, it's just a droop.  So...  I think a droop can be a fruit, right?  It doesn't necessarily mean a fruit's a droop.  Well, it depends.  A stone fruit.  What are you, fucking Dr. Seuss?  Exactly.  A droop can be a fruit.  Yes.  Oh, boy.  It opens up a whole nother can.  Sure does.  Get the pecker in it.  A cherry is a droop.  All right, look.  Single.  Stone.  Apricot.  How about their fruits? 
[00:42:30]  Apricot.  And how about pecans or nuts?  That's what they sleep on.  We're over-describing everything.  There's two things going on here.  Two shows, one time.  Enjoy.  Yeah.  I missed out on something really good, obviously.  Oh, it was just terrible.  Oh, my God.  A single stone with some juicy goodness around it.  Right.  Right?  Right.  Those are fruits.  Droops.  Oh, stop.  Use our time better than over-describing everything. 
[00:43:00]  Brendan in Westchester.  Brendan.  Oh, Brendan.  Hi, guys.  Long time for a time.  All right.  Wah, wah.  Well, you might find it interesting that a peanut actually isn't a nut.  It's a legume.  I know.  Everyone knows that.  Oh, okay.  Well, did you know that a banana is actually a berry?  Oh, it is not.  It's not a berry.  So is Fred.  And Marvin.  And boysen.  It's not a berry, sir.  Oh, really?  So you have, like, blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and you throw in the other berry, 
[00:43:30]  which is a banana?  Shut up.  It doesn't work.  Sorry.  No.  Call them with your favorite troops.  Why is it a berry?  Why is that guy gone?  What the fuck?  You can't leave us hanging.  Why is the banana a fucking berry?  He meant B-U-R-Y.  There's always some dumb fucking technicality of how it grew, or that it came from a blossom  instead of this.  Yeah, exactly.  Did you know that Melba toast is technically a plant? 
[00:44:00]  Shut up.  It's not.  Let's go to Jamie.  Jamie.  Oh, fuck.  I got more coffee.  Go ahead, Jamie.  Jamie.  Are you crying?  Nah, I got a sore throat here.  Hey.  Remember Van Halen was going to take a little break, and we said, yeah, right?  Yeah, they'll be right back, won't they?  Go ahead, Jamie.  Hey, the cashew is not a nut.  All right.  The cashew?  The cashew?  The fruit.  The cashew fruit.  Oh, okay.  I'm very serious. 
[00:44:30]  How about the coins, you?  That's what Mama wore on her feet.  Cashew.  Mama cats.  Cashew.  I was just asking what Johnny wore on her feet.  Oh, cashew.  Well, that's what you do, what you check.  Cashew check.  Get it.  Fucking terrible wordplay jokes.  Horrid.  Wow.  It's going to be a long fucking four hours.  Four.  We're down to three.  I'm watching.  Trust me.  I'm dragging my broke leg across the fucking end of the year finish line. 
[00:45:00]  Our ass is going to be raw after all the dragging we did today.  Oh, come on now.  It's out again.  Huh?  Again.  Okay, now it's good.  So basically, I have to sit here.  If I move forward.  Yeah, yeah.  Ooh.  That's a bad chord, definitely.  That sounds good.  Hello, hello.  Amelia Earhart.  Do you hear us?  Amelia Earhart.  Please come in.  Don't bust it.  Oh, Jesus.  No. 
[00:45:30]  Ooh.  Oh.  Well.  Are there any engineers working today?  Yes.  Yeah, someone's going to fix it when we take a break, but we haven't read it.  Right.  Fudge is good.  Fudge is good?  I blame.  Yeah, we packed it.  I blame Gary, the radio wizard.  You do?  Yeah, I'm going to blame him right to the end of the year.  He's the radio wizard.  Has to be a twist.  Fix this fucking black thing.  Oh, Jesus.  That's fucking falling off the wall.  It goes back to his childhood.  Oh, boy.  The song goes ever since he was a young boy. 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  I got something I want to play going in.  I got something I'm going to break.  Ooh.  Yes, I do.  The story of the droop.  Oh, the story of the droop.  Aw.  Cookies are good.  Is your mic working?  Yeah, it's good.  You know what it is?  I have to leave it here, so I have to lean forward.  Like, now...  Oh, you hear that?  I just touched the cord.  It does it.  Yeah, and it goes out.  Now my mic is out.  Yeah.  Hopefully it will be on soon.  Or I will be happy to talk like this. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, just yell the whole show.  Now I do.  Now.  There it is.  Wow, that cord is fucked.  Do people notice that?  Yeah, I think they know.  Do people notice that?  Luckily, they must have.  They really want to make it so hard just to fucking do this show.  I'm sure they tested it beforehand.  No, of course not.  I don't even think they had anyone coming in for Mars.  No.  Why would you do that? 
[00:47:00]  Well, maybe Mars is just not...  Has...  Doesn't have the value of...  You know what I mean?  He's just replaced by nothing, because that's what he contributes.  Could be.  Well, it could very well be.  Fudge is good, though.  Who came in to test the...  Yeah, I can't hear you, what you're saying.  Okay.  I don't know what you're saying, dude.  Who came in to test the equipment today?  I don't hear you.  Did we have somebody to come in today?  We did.  Okay.  And this...  I guess he probably just turned it on and didn't, you know...  Why do we have more technical problems than podcasts? 
[00:47:30]  I don't know.  Podcasts are like...  That's like college radio.  It's easy, too.  Except for a couple that obviously are shining out there.  Obviously shining.  You know who you are.  I'm not going to mention names, because I want them all to wonder if they're the ones shining.  But really, in general, that's just like college radio crap.  Well, anybody could do it.  Yeah, you're just plugging in shit.  Right.  And we have this big fucking radio show with shitty equipment.  Yeah.  Is it working now, Jimmy?  I don't want you to be distracted, because I had something really good for the break. 
[00:48:00]  Damn it.  When is Christmas?  Go over there.  I think it's Tuesday.  It's on the 25th this year.  Tuesday.  I thought it was Wednesday.  How cute is me?  Aw.  You want to just switch mics?  Oh, gosh.  You want to be some fudge?  No.  No.  Is the Radio Wizard here, so he can fix this?  He's not here just yet.  He just assumed everything would be taken care of. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, Anthony.  We literally have no staff, except for you.  It's down to Sam and Travis.  Yeah.  Only love can't make it rain.  Everyone else is gone until the new year, and there's Dope Gary, the Radio Wizard.  Don't you think he should be here to make sure everything is running smoothly, considering we're down a lot of people right now? 
[00:49:00]  Yeah.  By the way, I'm not touching him.  No.  It's just doing that.  How about we just let that happen until he gets his ass in here and fixes it?  This whole Mayan apocalypse thing is seeming more and more likely.  At least with this show.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I'll bet you that's what it is.  What?  The Mayans?  Yeah.  I don't know what you're saying.  Maury's wings don't come off, even in hurricane force winds!  Oh, my God. 
[00:49:30]  It's terrible.  Why didn't that dope get his ass in here?  Who are you talking about?  Gary.  What's his last name?  I want his last name today.  I'm not going to say his last name on the air in case I get in trouble.  Gary.  Fuck, I don't know.  Shepardini?  Gary Shepardini?  No.  Shepardini.  I'll never understand that.  We're obviously down a lot of people with vacation and whatnot.  Almost everybody.  Everyone's gone except Sam and Travis.  Oh, E-Rock took vacation.  And this idiot doesn't even fucking...  It's not even a thought in his mind, like, I should probably be in there.  No.  Because they're shorthanded. 
[00:50:00]  It's his job title.  Danny was going to be here, but...  Oh.  You know.  Well, not if the company has any say in it.  Yeah.  My goodness.  Courageous.  Yes, I can change a mic cord.  It ain't my goddamn job.  And we don't have one just laying around.  But that's not the point.  Right.  We could do a lot of stuff.  There are people who are paid to change mic cords.  Look, I'll change the mic cord in a second if Gary...  Fuck.  I just thought we couldn't curse on the radio. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, you're freaking out.  I swear to God.  I saw you like...  You went like, oops.  I'm losing my mind for a second there.  I thought...  You thought it was fucking 15 years ago.  Well, someone asked me recently if I could do a show without cursing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That just hit my fucking head.  I can't say.  I can't say right now.  They said, could you do the show without cursing?  Why?  Oh, is it a job offer type of question?  It was here.  Stop starting rumors.  Wasn't that here?  I do remember somebody asking us that. 
[00:51:00]  Like a terrestrial thing?  But I would say this much.  Why do they want you to do so without cursing?  Oh, stop.  Other opportunities?  Stop already.  Now he's just starting rumors.  I will fix that mic in two seconds if Gary resigns today.  Oh, wow.  Because that means we could do his job.  That's why we're not doing his job.  Well, can we get a final word on whether or not Opie's changing the record then?  That numbskull should be here today knowing that we're shorthanded. 
[00:51:30]  That's how this shit works.  Is everybody on vacation?  Is he entitled to?  Well, I mean, maybe he doesn't want to come in because he knows you'll do things like  call him a numbskull.  Oh, yeah.  Sal's here.  Okay, Sal's here.  What about Manny?  But he's like an intern.  He is an intern.  He's just walking down the hall.  Look at this clown.  What are you talking about?  Could be one of five people.  Sal.  Oh, that's good again.  Here's Mars.  Mars is on the phone?  I think.  But someone has to talk to him for a while before we get to talk to him, so I can't 
[00:52:00]  pick him up yet.  Thank you.  Mars.  Yo, yo, what's up, fellas?  And why does your phone suck?  My phone sucks because it's a company phone.  What?  That's not Mars' phone.  That's our mic.  Oh, my God.  That mic is horrible.  Yeah.  Are you all right?  I'm all right.  How are you guys doing?  There it is.  Wow.  You got a horrible phone.  What kind of phone you got?  It's a company phone.  Oh, well, there you go. 
[00:52:30]  It sounds very, what, hollow.  Old school.  Very old school.  Yeah.  Mars, I'm calling to say that you're very missed, and I want you to come in today.  Well, that's great.  That's a great request.  It won't happen, though, because I'm not going in.  But I will tell you this.  I did make sure that I told those people in engineering to have someone and check out the  studio like I do on a daily basis.  Well, they're not.  First of all, since you've been gone, which I don't know, it's been at least a month, 
[00:53:00]  I would assume.  My head can't take it.  The studio's freezing when we get here.  Half the TVs aren't on.  The little screen that I get to see E-Rock with hasn't worked in days, and no one gives  a fuck.  Today, Jimmy's mic is horrendous.  And we got this little black thing that's falling off the wall.  I can't hear you, Jimmy.  Yeah, yeah.  And light bulbs are out.  What happened?  It sounds like you truly missed me, and I appreciate being missed.  See, Jimmy's trying to use his mic, but you can't hear him right now. 
[00:53:30]  I can't hear you, Jim.  No.  Other black shit has fallen off the walls, we're noticing.  You want me to tell you another inside deal that's going on?  Yeah.  Do tell.  All the managers in engineering are gone.  Everyone's gone except us.  How are we still here today?  And then, at the end of the year, they'll tell us we ran out of vacation days.  How does that make sense?  We got a lot of time.  Howard's not back until February. 
[00:54:00]  Jesus.  And we're pretty much working right up until Christmas.  Amazing.  And then they'll say, oh, sorry, you can't take that Friday off.  You ran out of days.  How is that possible?  You guys got to keep better track.  Oh, I'm keeping track.  Yeah?  Yes.  So how do we fix, no, I don't want to fix Jimmy's mic.  Who do you want to fix it?  Well, we'll move Jimmy over, because that's not fair to Jimmy that he's not heard until the  mic is fixed.  Penn's coming in.  Oh, Penn's coming in.  So that means Jimmy can't talk today. 
[00:54:30]  And Jimmy wants to.  They already know in the shop, but I can call around and make sure someone spurs it away.  It's a bigger issue.  I don't understand why the studio wasn't set up properly with your absence.  It's cheap fucking mic cord.  Guys, you guys should bring it up, because I did bring it up.  I have an email to cover my butt.  And I don't see any work order saying that that was done every morning like I do.  No, no one's coming in here.  I mean, and I did tell people this screen's been out, but maybe it's a tough fix. 
[00:55:00]  I don't know.  For the record, somebody was definitely in here to test the studio on Tuesday.  Tuesday.  Okay.  I know that to be a fact.  All right.  Yeah, it's supposed to be done every day.  Yeah.  It wasn't done on Monday.  Definitely.  It was not done on Monday.  No.  Tuesday definitely was done.  Yeah.  That's all I can confirm.  Yeah.  This is how we're spending the last show of the year.  With crackly Mike Jim.  Pretty much how we started the year. 
[00:55:30]  Well, sorry, Jimmy.  And sorry, guys.  But, you know, I was forced to take this vacation, so.  You were forced?  Yeah.  If they don't use their days, they lose them.  Use them or lose them.  Use them or lose them.  I know about that.  Yeah.  That's why The Rock's been gone the whole month.  Yeah.  All right, Mars.  Your phone sucks.  All right, guys.  Merry Christmas.  Happy New Year.  Feliz Navidad.  Oh, very good.  Feliz Navidad.  Very good.  Prospero aÃ±o.  I don't know what that means.  No one else would that mean. 
[00:56:00]  You motherfucker.  Let's do it, baby.  Bye-bye.  He wished you a Happy New Year.  Oh, all right.  Oh, I thought it was something like, let the immigrants in.  No.  Some battle cry.  No.  Hey, can we play the Radio Wizard song today?  Which one?  Do we have it quickly, Travis?  I can't see you, Travis.  Travis is looking for it.  If you give me like two minutes, we can get it.  Hang on.  Sure.  Why not?  You know, we should have Sam.  For that droop, the Radio Wizard, we're going to go to break with a song.  Because that little TV screen is done, we should have Sam have to draw a little drawing of what 
[00:56:30]  Travis is doing at any given moment.  Yeah.  Like those court fucking drawings.  Or I'll make emoticons.  Yes, yes.  So you know what emotion is going on in the other room.  Oh, he's Travis's winky face.  Just board face, board face, board face.  Ah, shit.  Yeah.  We've got to get a new court in there.  I've got something good to play to break, too.  Maybe I can play it after the break. 
[00:57:00]  What is it?  It's just something.  I wish I knew.  And who wants you to stop cursing, anyway?  Will you shut up?  Stop starting fucking rumors.  Yeah, I want to know who's still who is.  A lot of mystery.  Stop starting fucking rumors.  Ending the year with mystery.  We got that, Travis.  I wonder how quickly someone's going to come in and fix Jimmy's mic once we go.  Immediately.  Once we go off.  It'll be a quick fix, but that's not the point here.  Can't you see if Travis is looking for it or not?  No, I cannot.  If I'm looking for the Radio Wizard thing? 
[00:57:30]  Yeah.  Sal's getting the disc.  Okay.  Louder.  Oh, boy.  This is going to take you.  Sorry, guys.  Oh, yes, and I can turn Jimmy's mic off.  Absolutely, I can.  Why would you, though?  Yeah.  I want to make it hurt for the Radio Wizard.  Oh, I thought that was help arriving.  Everybody know it as Sal's mustache?  Everybody?  Oh, hey.  There you go.  What is that?  What did you say, Jim?  What is that?  You don't like it, Jimmy?  No.  It's terrible.  You look like a fucking asshole. 
[00:58:00]  You look like a fucking asshole.  Wow, that's great.  Why the mustache?  Yeah.  Looks like you drank chocolate milk.  Oh, Jesus.  I don't know.  I felt like growing one.  Let me see.  But didn't you not grow one when we asked you to?  Yeah.  But now you feel like growing one, so you're growing one?  That's hipster shit.  That is hipster.  Can somebody ask Errol Flynn why he's supporting that look?  Errol Flynn.  It's a great joke.  It is a great joke, Sam.  I wish I had been sharing with the audience.  I can't really hear it.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  We'll play this for that droop Gary.  Ever since he was a young boy, he's been fucking bald.  His venice instincts, he just clutters up the hall.  Asking him questions like talking to a wall.  That egghead dummy doesn't like the show at all.  He's the radio wizard, but doesn't know shit. 
[00:59:00]  The radio wizard is such a stupid twit.  Why do you think he doesn't like the show?  I wish that he would.  I do like this. 
[00:59:30]  It's a good one.  It's a good one tune, yeah.  Love Zeppelin.  Pendulet coming in today.  Just happened to be in New York.  He said, hey, I want to stop by.  He said, all right. 
[01:00:00]  We could do that.  Yes.  We like Pendulet.  Yeah.  I like him a lot.  I liked his book.  Read the whole goddamn thing.  I read your book.  I read the whole thing.  Pendulet loves having sex.  Oh.  Well.  Loves having sex.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  And how did that get presented in the book?  A few sex stories in his book?  Sure.  He's been in some situations, it seems.  Normal sex or weirdo sex? 
[01:00:30]  I think he might have done a little sex clubbing.  Whoa.  Jimmy.  How was that, Jimmy?  We fixed Jim Norton's microphone.  Sounds much better now.  Yeah.  I was out for a bit.  No, I'm back now.  That's great.  Now you got radio voice.  That's a new chord.  Yeah.  It's the new me.  The cookies are gone already.  Yeah, they're delish.  Cookies.  There's still a bunch.  What?  There's still a bunch.  Half of them are gone. 
[01:01:00]  Treat yourself, Anthony.  I don't like any of this garbage.  You haven't even tried any of it.  I like store-bought cookies.  They look store-bought, though.  These are better.  These are like specialty cookies.  Yeah, there's actually love in them.  Something that you're missing from your life.  I don't like the famous famous.  She puts one of her pubes in each one.  What is that?  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  Why don't you have a piece of fudge?  The fudge is probably good.  I had one pecan and one cookie.  Oh, have mercy.  The fudge is delish.  No, I can't.  It's right to my thighs.  No?  No, I can't. 
[01:01:30]  Why is that?  I'm trying to eat better.  What, you got something to look good for?  I lost a few pounds.  Ah.  Just a few LBs.  Is this related to...  Is this a television thing, the no cursing thing?  Television thing.  And all of a sudden, you want to make sure you look good.  That'd be really nice.  It's very mysterious.  Mysterious.  Oh, Jimmy.  You didn't use a tissue over there.  Your napkins are very abrasive.  Have a treat, Anthony.  You'll feel better.  No, I'm not going to have a treat.  You'd need some sweetness. 
[01:02:00]  Nah.  You guys know Steve Wozniak there?  Steve Wozniak.  What do we know about Steve Wozniak?  Started Apple with Steve Jobs.  Started Apple with Steve Jobs.  You're absolutely right.  Yes.  I just read his book.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, it's a fascinating read, man.  I was.  Do you know apples are actually considered beef?  That's what I tell you.  Man, I didn't see that one coming.  Oh, what?  Yeah, Steve Wozniak started the old Apple with Steve Jobs. 
[01:02:30]  Woo!  And in this book, he talks about the creation of the chip.  What's that?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The microchip, I would say.  What's that?  The microchip.  And how it's changed the world.  Yeah.  Yes.  Probably the most amazing invention that has changed the world more than I think anything else.  What would that be?  The microchip.  What's that?  What's that?  I brought a little excerpt from his book. 
[01:03:00]  Thank you.  I brought an excerpt from his book.  Yeah, did?  Because I think it's very fascinating.  Good excerpt.  Experts are important to hear them talk.  No excerpt.  Excerpt.  You're saying it wrong, stupid.  Cocksucker.  Fuck you for Christmas.  Chip Voss.  What's that?  The beauty is, you know, you can read books.  I read books.  And then you go, wow, that was fascinating.  Now I go find the audio book.  We do a radio show.  Now I can bring the part of the fucking book in.  Book on tape?  To play for everybody.  Whatever they call it these days. 
[01:03:30]  Yes.  My mother slapped me in the face one time for reading.  She goes, what are you, uppity?  All of a sudden, you missed the big pants?  So I brought in this little part of the book, Steve Wozniak, talking about the microchip.  What's that?  That changed how we all live.  He was talking about what?  Don't get him going.  We all know what it is.  Yes.  It's the micro.  Microwafer.  Microwafer. 
[01:04:00]  Exactly.  Here's Steve Wozniak.  Chips.  What's that?  Chips.  Chips.  Chips.  I never had the courage to ask Chip Chips.  What's that?  Steve Jobs.  Free Chips.  What's that?  Chip Company.  What?  Very few chips.  What's that?  20 chips.  What's that?  Which is very, very few chips.  What's that?  Chips I had.  That's right.  A few chips.  What's that?  Ram chips.  Ram chips.  What's that?  Chips.  What's that?  Use the chips.  What's that?  Including chips.  What's that?  Chip.  Chips.  What's that?  Chips on.  What's that?  Chips.  What's that?  Chips.  What's that?  Chips.  Their chips went bad to those chips. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, what's that?  Registers, chips, dates, chips that were coming up.  Small chips.  Yeah, what's that?  With a couple of chips inside, your chips can really do only one thing.  They do, right?  What's that?  What's that?  If I could use chips in the amount of chips, put a few chips together, and use a crystal clock chip.  What's that?  28 chips for the wrong design.  Wow, that's amazing.  I programmed these little chips, the fewest possible chips.  What's that?  Higher and higher in chip count.  What's that?  Approaching 200 chips.  What's that?  Thousands of little chips.  Oh, but then what's that?  Wire chips together. 
[01:05:00]  Steve would wire the chips together.  What's that?  Connecting chips with wires, wires, chips, and everything.  What's a chip?  A normal digital chip.  What's that?  A chip that works with ones and zeros, not waves.  And you spun this chip around with one little digital chip.  What's that?  The whole thing used 45 chips.  How did you do that?  What's that?  They were paying us based on how few chips I could do it in.  Really brilliant to put that kind of stuff together.  What's that?  Only now all the CPU parts were on one chip instead of a bunch of chips.  What's that?  Like memory chips.  How they're doing this?  It's really driving me crazy.  What's that? 
[01:05:30]  And mine had a CPU that was on several chips.  What's that?  Or another processor like it and some memory chips.  What's that?  I never could have done something like that.  It's really difficult.  What's that?  It's really difficult.  What's that?  A couple of other chips.  What's that?  Read-only memory chips.  What's that?  Chips that hold their information.  You can do something like that because it just seems like it's really difficult.  What's that?  It just seems like it's very difficult.  What's that?  Chips I was interested in.  Very difficult to do this because.  What's that?  The fact that this chip was so easy to get of what the Motorola chip would cost me.  Chuck Peddle was peddling the chip.  Chuck Peddle?  Who the fuck is that?  What's that?  Who the fuck is Chuck Peddle? 
[01:06:00]  What's that?  What's that?  I hate his fucking guts.  What's that?  Don't mean nothing to me, Chuck Peddle.  Fuck you.  What's that?  What's that?  Don't mean nothing.  Fuck you.  What's that?  What's that?  How long is this tape?  It's fucking good.  This guy's really smart.  What's that?  I borrowed 32 SRAM chips. 
[01:06:30]  What's that?  These chips inside the sockets with all the chips in place to burn the program into chips.  I can't listen to this.  What's that?  I studied the chip's data sheets.  Here was a computer with 30 chips on it, having so few chips.  What's that?  It was like the same amount of chips on an Altair.  We're talking about a new memory chip, which would have 4K bits per chip.  The first time silicon chip memory would only take eight chips instead of the 32 SRAM chips,  as few chips as possible.  I had selection chips.  Vertical counter chips of the two of these selection chips and maybe another chip or two 
[01:07:00]  worth of logic get a DRAM chip.  4K bit DRAM chips for sale at a reasonable price.  But he got me Intel DRAM chips.  I had to add a couple more chips to my computer, but the Intel chips were physically so much  smaller than the AMI chips.  A smaller sized chip with the fewest chips.  I was trying to get chips for a computer I'd designed.  If I used chips by Synergetics, the computer had fewer chips than if I used Fairchild chips.  Which Synergetics chips I'd used? 
[01:07:30]  What's that?  The Synergetics chips I'd used in the design were much larger than the equivalent Fairchild chips.  What's that?  Not simply fewer chips.  From designing for fewer chips, usually fewer chips means fewer connections, but not always.  Add a couple of extra chips to go with Intel's chips.  What's that?  Because that chip design eventually became the standard for all memory chips.  What's that?  I'm just saying it now.  I don't even know who's quality.  What's that?  What do you want, Ma?  Ma, you're not supposed to do that with those at Docker. 
[01:08:00]  Ma, what's that?  You're fucking sitting on it like that.  I don't like this.  Ma, what's that?  What's that?  I feel like I'm dreaming of something.  What's that?  What's that?  The Apple II would be designed with colorability on those chips.  Oh, what's that?  I knew I would save some chips.  I fucking hate this book.  What's that?  The Apple II ended up with half as many chips as the Apple I was.  What's that?  Why is he saying this?  By now, I had faster DRAM chips.  What's that?  These new chips can do it twice every microsecond. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, God.  This little blank board with chips on the top side of it.  There wasn't a single chip I could save.  I know.  What's that?  I was so impressed to meet him after the roll of his chip.  Showed him how many chips and how it worked and everything.  That was making a chip that was compatible with...  They said that any ROM chips we had around...  What's that?  ...connected to a ROM or PROM chip on the board.  ...with just a single PROM chip.  But 22 or so chips.  What's that?  About 20 of them weren't needed.  I stripped out 20 of their chips.  I did this using two chips.  What's that?  One chip was a register and one was a PROM. 
[01:09:00]  What's that?  And saving it to the master 8-bit chip register.  What's that?  And put in the exact same chips.  What's that?  And had us add chips...  What's that?  ...that you do have inside the chip.  Oh, what's that?  ...because the chip didn't already have 4-bit microprocessor chip...  What's that?  ...transistors on a chip.  What's that?  ...memory chips.  What's that?  Wow.  So...  That was fucking good.  Let's hear that again.  That was fucking great, this guy.  It's very fascinating, right?  Yeah.  Wow, yeah.  It shows you how the chip changed the world. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  The microchip.  Oh, wow.  Boy, he sure likes saying that.  He sure does.  Guy loves me.  Just a little section of the book.  Steve Wozniak.  Amazing.  What's that?  Oh, poor chip.  He went to a dark place for a while.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He couldn't deal with it. 
[01:10:00]  He got chip overload.  No.  I enjoy Stalker Patty singing.  I do.  Did you like that?  When she sang Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer?  You could say there's no such thing as Santa.  Where is she?  As for me and Grandma, we believe.  She jazzed it up.  Where's she from?  Where's our Christmas songs that we were playing the other day?  Which ones?  That little disc I had with all the E-Rock Christmas songs. 
[01:10:30]  Sex may have hidden him somewhere.  You think?  Sexy?  Sexy.  The last day to play Christmas songs.  Sexy who went on vacation.  Sex is on break.  A long time ago.  He gave himself a little vacation.  So what does he do?  He works the first ten and a half months of the year and then takes a lot of time off at the end of the year?  Well, he's here for the first ten and a half months of the year and then, yeah.  He's had a lot of days off since that hurricane.  Hurricane.  I don't give a fuck. 
[01:11:00]  And Troy and Roland are out in Vegas right now?  Oh, no.  Yeah, I see the Instagramming going on.  Oh.  Are they in trouble yet?  I don't know what their plan is.  They left yesterday morning.  Is Troy's girl with them?  Yep.  It's Troy, his girl, and Roland.  Thank you.  Partying in Vegas.  I can hang with Roland or Troy or his girl for that matter.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm the idiot today.  Uh-oh.  The songs were right in front of my fucking face.  Dang.  That's a weird vacation, though. 
[01:11:30]  Roland texted me yesterday.  He sent me this UFC club thing.  No, Roland's going to his parents' house out there in Arizona.  Oh, he's stopping over.  Yeah, he's just making like a three-day Vegas trip.  So he's doing a little Vegas stopover.  And Troy joined him.  Why?  Because Troy has no family?  Well, Troy was going to California.  He is going to California with his girl.  I think Troy was raised by wolves.  You think so out there in PA?  Yeah, we don't know much about him.  No.  I think he was raised by wolves.  That would make sense.  And certainly wolves don't celebrate Christmas, so that gives him the opportunity to kind of  do some other shit.  I'm going to see my new nephew on this weekend, I think. 
[01:12:00]  Now that he's eight?  No, he's a little boy.  He's very cute.  Is he?  Yeah, he's fucking really cute.  Can I see a picture?  Sure.  He's really cute.  How old is he?  A few months.  A little ahead of my daughter?  Three months, maybe?  About that.  Is she three months already?  No, mine's, where are we up to?  What happened?  Two and a half months.  What's the matter, sweetie?  I got blown by nose.  Oh, okay.  Who's my nose?  Two and a half months for me.  I think you're a little ahead. 
[01:12:30]  Your sister's a little ahead.  Maybe three, three and a half, I'm going to say.  Let me see.  Well, yeah, my goal was to kill Chip, but I think he survived it.  Yeah.  I told Chip that I would take him on, and today was the day, and he might have the victory  today.  Okay.  I will go back to the drawing board.  I will kill Chip.  I think I'm allergic.  To what?  Those stupid cookies, right?  Oh, my God.  Adorable.  Yeah, he's cute, baby. 
[01:13:00]  Wowee.  That's like a mini you.  Yeah.  You look at the flip through.  But every baby looks like a mini Jimmy just because no hair.  Because they're adorable.  Oh, my God.  He's cute, right?  Yeah, he's cute.  That looks like you.  That's creepy.  There's one picture.  I don't know if she wants to post any of these, but there's one that looks absolutely  like a mini you.  That's adorable.  Very nice.  Oh, my God.  What am I, allergic to something?  My eyes are itching like crazy. 
[01:13:30]  And I'm sneezing.  You're like sneezing.  Yeah.  I have no idea.  I think it's an allergy day.  It's all that wind blowing shit around.  Is that what it is?  I just went to the bathroom, and this building is creaking.  Is it?  Yeah.  That's all right, right?  Fezzy's going to have a tough time getting up here today.  Oh, boy.  Why?  Is he scared of the building?  Oh, my God.  Is he scared of the building?  Scared of the building, of course.  And then when it's a windy building, forget it.  Does he panic?  Oh, yeah.  He'll be in panic.  Ah, poor Fezzy.  He doesn't like going in the elevator, especially on windy days.  When you hear, like, the elevator shaft is like, whoosh. 
[01:14:00]  Well, is it?  Scary.  What's he afraid of?  Is he afraid of dying or getting stuck in the elevator?  He's pretty much afraid of air.  Shadows.  Yeah.  What is Fezzy so scared of?  Nothing bad is going to happen.  I don't know.  If it does, you deal with it.  Poor fella.  Yeah.  They're going to die in a fucking elevator.  What are you going to do?  They don't crash.  Tell that woman I got decapitated that.  Yeah, because she was getting on the elevator.  If you're in the elevator, you know, she didn't die in the elevator.  She died half in, half out.  That's all.  But she died painfully, too.  Like, she got mushed.  Nice. 
[01:14:30]  She got crammed and ripped in half.  I mean, that sucks.  Horrible.  That's a terrible death.  Well, what the fuck?  Don't put your arm in the elevator.  Everybody does that, though.  I do the quick wave through.  I do a hi-yah.  Hi-yah.  Yeah.  I actually just put my leg in.  I jiggle and I go, hokey pokey.  Let's see if they open the door.  Turn yourself around.  Yeah.  I love that song.  Of course.  Well, why don't we play a couple Christmas songs for everybody in the Christmas spirit.  Merry Christmas. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, boy.  Nagel sucks, Nagel sucks, Nagel sucks, Cops.  He rocked his bed, let's get, let's rid of the bed.  He sucks on penises day after day.  He'd suck them all if he had his way.  Piggy boy, piggy boy, piggy boy, eat.  One thing that's salty and one thing that's sweet.  He is a lazy piece of shit on the job. 
[01:15:30]  That's because he's made of flop.  His gut's big.  He's a real pig.  He's eaten up all the pie.  He's a phony.  He eats baloney.  Oh, how I wish that he would die.  He works bad.  He runs bad.  Isn't it true?  His torture is all for you.  He's a real hit big, double-fadget. 
[01:16:00]  Nagel really sucks, Cops.  That's a cute one.  I love how these guys sell it.  What a cute little number that is.  It's all how you sell it.  It's in the Christmas spirit.  That's why it's so important.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, this time of year.  You know Opie and Anthony and little Jimmy Norton.  Sure do.  Travis, Sal, and Danny.  Whoops.  Roland, Troy, and Sammy. 
[01:16:30]  But do you recall the most morbidly obese one of all?  He rocked the shit, dick, fat fuck.  He's a lazy piece of shit.  And if you ever saw him, you'd know him by his huge bitch tits.  All of the other assholes laugh and call him piggy boy. 
[01:17:00]  They never let poor E-Rock have his hoagies and his shitty toys.  Cow noises.  Nice.  I like that.  I just checked the old Twitter.  The Brad Bankson writes, or tweets, I just yelled,  who's ready for a road trip with 10 hours of the O&A channel?  Wife started crying. 
[01:17:30]  That's right.  I guess this is a get the fuck out day, right?  Oh, it's a busy travel day, right?  Is today the busy day?  Definitely.  Where people start moving on.  Yeah, because people got Monday and Tuesday off, so they're traveling today.  Moving on to the old relatives' houses.  Yeah.  Spend the weekend.  You wake up.  You're where you want to be.  It's going to be a very Philly Christmas for me.  Yeah?  Oh.  A very Philly Christmas.  I think the, I'm thinking eight years in a row now.  Wow.  Holy shit, really?  We start our own tradition next year. 
[01:18:00]  Next year it begins.  You want to come over?  No.  I got nowhere to go.  You want to come to Westchester?  You want to come down to Philly?  Westchester?  We have a really fun Christmas party down there.  Yeah, we will.  Christmas Eve.  I'm serious.  You're more than welcome.  I'm going to see my family maybe Christmas Day.  It depends on when I see Tracy and my family.  If I see them Christmas Eve, I'll see them.  And if I see them Christmas Day, I'll come down to Philly because I have nothing to do.  You really have nothing to do?  No.  Oh, it's okay.  My family.  I'm welcome to see my family.  I'm just, yeah.  Why don't you?  I probably will.  I just don't know what day.  Do you have a Christmas tree?  No, but I had a little work done in the apartment, so my apartment's a mess right now. 
[01:18:30]  But it's a good mess.  Well, if Christmas Day is a thing that you have time for, of course you can come by my  I'm busy!  Oh, sorry.  Sorry.  Everyone will be there.  I mean, having a big party.  What do I do?  Go over there and tell a bunch of jokes for free?  Just nasty guest guy.  Hey, Merry Christmas.  Anybody else want to do some fucking stuff for free around here?  Oh, Jesus.  The kids are crying.  Jimmy's making a scene. 
[01:19:00]  I'm just doing inappropriate show references.  Yes.  I'm just going, hey, Christmas queefs.  That's you?  Yeah, me.  Crying, of course.  Pissy eyes.  I feel a pissy eye today.  Eyes are like tearing.  And my nose is stuffy.  It's an afron and visine.  You know, I think we'd help that a fist. 
[01:19:30]  I mean, there's real shit going on, but I think we should just try to keep it light  today, man.  We got Penn Jillette coming in.  Yes, Penn.  Although Penn probably...  I would absolutely like to hear Penn's take a little on the gun control issue, because  he did something on bullshit about it.  No, even better.  He did a great bullshit on violent video games.  Oh, that too.  Sure.  Ties in.  Someone that's informed.  Yes.  Unlike the news, talking to really old people about violent video games. 
[01:20:00]  What are you doing?  They don't know shit.  I love when they show video games from the early 90s.  They're not even first-person shooters.  Yeah, they haven't even updated their B-roll.  Duke Nukem.  Space Invaders.  You joke.  They've used Duke Nukem many, many times.  They're still using it.  Way past the shelf life of Duke Nukem.  Ridiculous.  But we'll talk about violent video games, because he did a really funny, well-informed  piece on that.  And the Jets are going to release Tebow, or trade him at the end of the season. 
[01:20:30]  What a bust that was.  That was a terrible move by Woody Johnson, but they also basically destroyed two quarterbacks.  Even though Sanchez is shit, I bet you Tebow does good things next year, because his confidence  was probably never there, because he knew he had an amazing year with Denver, and he was  talked about, and then all of a sudden he's just a fucking backup shithead just sitting  there.  That probably shook his confidence.  Yeah.  But I was telling Ant that Tebow was stupid.  He knew the team didn't really want him.  I believe he had a couple other options that were much better. 
[01:21:00]  But I think he got, he was starting to think New York would be great for the Tebow brand.  You know, Woody Johnson insisted that the team gets him, and obviously Rex Ryan never wanted  Tebow on the team.  That is so obvious now.  Because now you got, what, two games left, and here's a chance to throw him in there  and see exactly what he could fucking do.  And, you know, and Rex Ryan's still saying, no, fuck that.  Why is Rex Ryan saying he won't start him?  Because he doesn't believe in him. 
[01:21:30]  A lot of NFL coaches don't believe in Tebow.  A lot of people.  Yeah.  So, so I think Tebow in a weird way blew it.  He probably should have went somewhere else where maybe a team believed in him.  Yeah.  Although Woody Johnson may have sold him on it.  Nah, I'm telling you, you know.  Nah, I think you can't tell.  I don't think you can tell Woody Johnson that it's a bad move.  Oh, right.  You know, I think Rex Ryan, I think he's had a real shitty year, obviously.  And his stock has drastically dropped, but I don't think he was able to say, look, I don't 
[01:22:00]  want him on the fucking team.  I actually feel bad for Tebow at this point.  Like, not because he didn't perform, but it's like, you know, he didn't, that's an embarrassing  situation to be thrown into.  And when he was in there, he looked very, you know, bad.  Oh, he did look bad.  Oh, yeah, he did.  He had no confidence in it.  He looked just really just out of sorts, but he's being used in a strange way as well.  Terrible way.  So, whatever.  I think Rex Ryan was shit this year, too, though.  He had a terrible year of coaching, the way he handled those quarterbacks.  Like, Torrey always handled high talent very well. 
[01:22:30]  Like, he handled big egos well, and some coaches can and some guys can't.  Well, break out the tape.  When this went down, we said on the show that it was going to fuck up Sanchez's confidence.  Yep.  He doesn't have that confidence to begin with.  And then you got a guy, like, breathing down his neck like a Tebow.  So, you know, that fucks up your head.  He's damaged goods now.  Yeah, and the Jets had a few key injuries and all that.  It was just a horrendous year.  But now there's a huge rumor that Michael Vick might come to the Jets.  They could wreck his career, too. 
[01:23:00]  He finally makes it back after the dog thing.  He realized this was the worst mistake of his life.  The Jets destroy him, yeah.  Michael Vick as a Jet.  I don't know.  I don't know.  There's a pretty strong rumor about that.  We'll see.  But I think in the end, Tebow will be traded for almost nothing or just released.  And have a great year.  I guarantee you.  You think he'll have a great year?  Yep.  Who will pick him up?  Don't know.  But just the way it works.  Jacksonville, maybe?  I don't know.  I have to carry a guess.  They're hurting.  And he loves Florida, as we all know.  He's from Florida. 
[01:23:30]  Somebody might pick him up just for the money it will make.  The...  You know, it'll put seats in the old stands, I was about to say.  And the jerseys.  Well, I did say that, didn't I?  They're already installed.  I know.  Thank you, Sam.  Put asses in the seats.  All right.  So some lady got screwed on Wheel of Fortune.  I don't know what this is about.  Oh, yeah.  Literally?  I was watching this clip, and this lady got fucked out of winning the fucking prize.  Oh, shit.  Why?  I was like, what the fuck, Sajak?  What is your problem?  Oh, man.  That don't make no sense. 
[01:24:00]  G.  And there's a G.  I like the song.  Yep.  Seven swans a-swimming.  Yeah, that's...  Yeah.  Can't accept that.  Amy, it's your turn.  Come on, big money.  No whammy, no whammy.  Yeah, there is a...  Is there a V?  Yeah, there's a V. 
[01:24:30]  $500.  $500.  Seven swans a-swimming.  Yeah, that's it.  Do you know what happened there?  No.  Swimming.  Well, Renee knew what happened as well, and it was easy to do, because you just kind of  did it in the vernacular and left off the G, and seven swans a-swimming, and you were  pretty clear about that and realized you did that.  But you gave me some time.  That's terrible.  That's...  And the G was on the board.  She said a G, and then she said, I would like to solve the puzzle. 
[01:25:00]  She's the one that got the G.  Seven swans a-swimming.  Wait, I want to hear that.  The G was there.  Yeah.  They fucked her.  She fucked her.  And there's a G.  I'd like to solve...  Yep.  Seven swans a-swimming.  Yeah, that's...  That G's in there.  That's it.  That's fucking terrible.  Yeah, it was kind of swimming.  They fucked her.  I hope that she gets the money for that.  Ah, it's in there enough.  Wow.  Plus, she asked for G and got the G.  Yeah, that's terrible.  The G was there. 
[01:25:30]  The G was there.  That's terrible.  There's no way she could have thought that that ended in an end.  Are the Wheel of Fortune's taking themselves that seriously?  I don't know.  It's a goof show.  Fucking give her the stupid money.  What are those judges?  Those off-camera Wheel of Fortune judges that have gone on?  I told Vanna White to beat it.  Oh, bless you.  She just stands there looking old now.  I mean...  I got it when she was standing there looking pretty and shit, but now she's just standing there looking  old and shit.  Pat Sajeg is useless.  Is there an N?  Uh-huh.  Yep.  Well...  Is there a G?  Yep.  That's why I moved on to another letter.  Of course you did.  Too busy drinking the margaritas in between show tapings. 
[01:26:00]  Oh!  And not giving people prizes.  That's right.  Yeah, no prize giving, motherfucker.  That's right.  That's exactly right.  I saw one that was the Atlanta Falcons once, and...  Oh, actually, it just said Atlanta Falcons, and the woman went, the Atlanta Falcons.  Bam, bam.  Really?  No, the.  She said the.  Come on.  I know.  That's different, though.  That's adding a word.  Yes, I know, but, you know.  I used to play Hangman when I was a kid, and I was just the best. 
[01:26:30]  Are you very good at it?  Mm-hmm.  Is there an X, please?  An X?  There's never an X.  Of course not.  Very rarely.  Except his Isla phone.  Yeah.  Yes.  Jets traded for Tebow.  Tebow had no choice.  You know what?  Got to correct myself.  You're right.  You are right.  Tebow did not have a choice.  Well, I fucked that one up.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, Woody Johnson wanted him.  They traded for him, and Rex Ryan certainly is making it clear he never really wanted to 
[01:27:00]  make that trade.  Didn't they...  I'm sorry.  You're right.  Who'd they give up for him?  I think it was a cornerback named Marv Shrewsbury.  I think it was Marvy.  Marv Shrewsbury.  Good old Marvy.  I don't think so.  Your cousin, Marvin Shrewsbury?  Marv!  Oh, Ant.  I'm fucking...  I'm falling apart over here.  I got fluid dripping from my head.  What the hell's going on?  My tears are flying out.  Snot.  Pendulant sent a nice tweet about us.  Oh, yeah?  What did he say? 
[01:27:30]  What the fuck did he say?  Get to the bottom of this shit.  If it doesn't have Opie Radio in the tweet, then it's not a nice tweet.  How about that, Sam?  No, it could still be a nice.  How about that?  I disagree.  If he writes the Opie and Anthony without our Twitters, that's not helping us out.  That ain't giving us no fucking followers.  Where is it?  I'm just showing up my timeline.  My dad used to say he was going to bust my snot locker.  Snot locker.  Yeah, that was like he was going to punch me in the nose.  That's probably not what he said.  I'll bust your snot locker.  He probably said, get over here.  I want to fuck your shit locker.  I think I'd have recalled that. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, see, this is no good.  It's a great thing to write.  I'm walking over to do Opie and Anthony on Sirius.  Man, I love doing that show.  Just my favorite.  Great guys, and I get to talk.  Love them.  And I heard Sam's mom made treats.  He has a shitload of followers.  He can't write Opie Radio and Anthony Cumia?  It's the branding of the show that's important.  That is true.  It's not.  It's not true. 
[01:28:30]  It's all about Twitter followers.  Because people go, oh, Opie and Anthony on Sirius and Penn loves them.  It's all about Twitter followers, man.  No, it's not.  What is this, 2012?  Fuck out of here.  It's 2013.  See Instagram back down?  Good.  Not going to be selling your pictures.  Big deal.  They should just give you a piece of the action.  Who cares?  Not because you don't know where they're going to sell them to.  They could sell them in an ad or something.  I have a lot of pictures of myself frolicking in fields.  I don't want that used for margarine ad or something.  You think they're going to do that? 
[01:29:00]  Justin Stengel had a good tweet about the Instagram thing.  He was worried they were going to sell his shit picture or something like that.  Or him taking a dump.  I forget exactly.  It was much funnier when I read a tweet.  I'm trying to find it now.  He's very funny.  Put the Justin Stengel in the Twitter.  Please.  And then we're going to go to break.  And then we're going to get Penn Jillette in here to talk about violent video games.  Is he here?  No, he's walking over.  He better not be late.  That's right. 
[01:29:30]  It's all well and good.  He loves us.  But don't be late.  Capisce.  Capisce.  First time I've ever used a word capisce.  I love that word.  It worked.  Hey, Instagram.  Yeah.  Please don't sell my picture of me on the toilet.  Yeah.  There you go.  See?  It's good that you put that out there.  And then he wrote, trying to use the mind apocalypse to get anal from my wife.  Justin Stengel. 
[01:30:00]  Justin underscore.  That's funny.  S-T-A-N-G-E-L.  He's definitely a really good one to follow.  He's one of the most consistently funny people on Twitter.  Well, he's the head writer of Letterman.  Of course he is.  Funny as shit.  He better be.  He's got these one-liners.  Yeah, but that about the wife and the anal is just vulgarity.  That really, yeah.  If he needs to do that to be funny, well, I'm going to move forward.  Thank you.  What does he have on Pawn Stars?  The phone's in the way.  Pawn Stars is a great show.  I'm guessing the experts have never been with a woman. 
[01:30:30]  What?  Letterman admitting in the paper today that he suffered from depression.  Big interview going down this weekend.  With Oprah, right?  No, he's going with one of the CBS people.  Was it because he had to work with Justin?  And he wishes he had kids earlier in his life.  And he wishes he had more kids.  And he wishes he wasn't so...  Grumpy?  Kind of self-centered about his career and all that shit.  I wonder if he could let it go a little bit. 
[01:31:00]  He wishes he had a daughter.  His son is nine.  He's 65.  Wow.  So do you think that he's...  I would have let him face his mortality.  Like, he's looking at the fact that...  I'm 65.  By the time the kid graduates high school...  Yeah.  I'll be 74.  Yeah.  Like, will I even see my grandchildren?  Like, I guess you start to think that way.  You know, he's probably pretty healthy.  Well, he took pills for depression for a long time.  And then he kind of said, fuck this dumb pill shit.  And then he had a son and it changed his life. 
[01:31:30]  Your son.  Oh, it made him happier.  It made me happier, too.  I related to what I read today because half the shit doesn't mean shit anymore.  Only half the shit doesn't mean shit.  Only half shit.  It's half shit.  Yeah, I went with full shit and now it's only half the shit bothers me.  I've got to go full shit.  Last week...  That just doesn't matter as much.  Last week he tweeted out, damn, paparazzi snapped a picture of me getting out of a car  and you can totally see my pussy. 
[01:32:00]  Fucking hilarious.  And his brother's funny, too.  Yeah.  Eric's funny, too.  They're very nice guys, too.  They're what?  Co-headwriters of Letterman and they're friends of ours.  Yeah, they're both headwriters and executive producers.  How do brothers get a gig like that?  They're the Stangle brothers.  That's pretty fucking cool.  You can't tell them apart so they both just take credit for it.  They don't know who to hire.  They're like, look, we don't want to hire the...  There's a funny one and a dud.  We don't know who's who.  So they probably fuck chicks together.  Fucking Stangles are animals.  Remember when I thought I was right 
[01:32:30]  and then I was wrong with the Tebow thing  and I admit I was wrong.  Well, now I got to admit I was right.  Okay.  Does that make sense?  Because supposedly he did have a no trade clause, Tebow,  and he accepted the trade.  Oh, okay.  So it looks like I was right the whole time.  Well, that guy was an idiot then.  Until the next fucking tweet comes in saying I'm wrong again.  No, he doesn't know anything.  Why isn't he on the radio? 
[01:33:00]  My life sucks.  I'm just going to focus on his life.  I haven't done anything with my life,  but that don't matter.  I know if I did a radio show,  it would be better than theirs,  but I'm never going to do a radio show  because it's easy just to hate on everything.  Everyone on Twitter. 
[01:33:30]  Take me on, bitches.  Pendulet next.  K-Tel and Columbia House present  Ho, Ho, Ho  Three Whores  A Very Coomier Christmas  That's your gun for Christmas  Too bad you died of AIDS  Insert a rogue joke here 
[01:34:00]  Featured all your favorite Yule logs  She might have been ten  She might have been twenty  I couldn't tell  I was completely drunk  I went outside  To piss in the snow  And I pissed on  Santa Claus  Hey, Santa  I'm on a naughty list now  Old chestnuts  My earplugs  Roasted  By the fire 
[01:34:30]  I'll keep my baseball head on  For a little while  And there would be no  Coomier Christmas  Without a little la-la  I was living near the Jews  La-la-la-la  Plugging in my hair  With la-la-la-la  Eating all the blacks  With la-la-la-la  Shooting up my guns  With la-la-la-la  Live from the compound 
[01:35:00]  La-la-la-la  La-la-la-la-la  La-la-la-la-la  La-la-la-la-la-la-la  Ho, ho, ho  Three Whores  A very coomier Christmas  I was driving home  And I was behind a bus  You know, like the bus  Has an automatic sign  9-1-1  Call police  I call 9-1-1  9-1-1  What is the emergency?  I'm on 10th Avenue 
[01:35:30]  Northbound  And I'm behind the bus  And the sign says  Call 9-1-1  I thought it was a stolen bus  I didn't know  It was happening  There could have been hostages  I mean, we all saw  That Keanu Reeves movie  I'm on the phone  With the 9-1-1  And this fucking dummy  Is, where are you now?  I said, I'm northbound  On 47th Street  On 10th Avenue  Okay, you're on  Now, where are you now?  I said, 48th Street  Where are you now?  49th Street  And you said  It's heading which way, sir?  Northbound  The only way you can go  On 10th Avenue  We're so irritated  With these dummies  So we make the left  On 57th Street  We go down to 11th Avenue  I go, look 
[01:36:00]  He's making the left  On 11th Avenue  It's a yellow light  So the bus slows down  And then shoots through the light  And leaves me at the red light  I knew that the bus  Did that on purpose  I'm like, this guy knows  I'm behind him  Now we're going southbound again  So I called back  So I just called  And no one is doing anything  I'm following a stolen bus, I think  No one is doing it  How long does it take  To get a squad car  On fucking 11th Avenue  So I pull up next to it  And it's really dark on the bus  And I just see some  There's a black dude  I'm on the phone  I'm like, I'm looking at the guy  And he's just a black dude  But he's not dressed like a bus driver  And I know that he's stealing this bus 
[01:36:30]  I'm northbound now  And he's behind me  And they're like, what street?  I'm like  Now we're passing 40th Street  The woman was like  Where was he before?  10th and 11th  But then he came down  11th  And now we went up 10th  So then I was just like  Fuck this shit  And I drive away  And he pulls away slowly  And starts to drive  And I'm like, you know what  Forget it  You know what  He just turned it off  He just turned it off  We lost him  And he probably turned into

[01:39:30]  For our last show  Of the year  Yes  Well last show  Ever  Well no  I think ever  I think we're good  The end of the world  Didn't happen  I think we're making it  We have a few hours  But we don't know  We don't know  Watch our calendar  Be a little off though  Watch us be off  By 12 hours  And we think  We're fine tomorrow  Fucking rock  Kiss the planet  I've been arguing  If the Mayans  Said end of the world  That means end of the world  Which means Australia  Is good  So we're good  I see  I see  Right  Or is it on our time  The Mayans decided 
[01:40:00]  It's gotta be on New York time  It just reminds me  Exactly  How little people  Who believe  Believe  I mean you actually  Hear people who say  They think that's true  But they haven't  Gotten rid of their houses  They're not fucking  Anything that moves  They haven't gotten rid  Of all their money  They're hedging their bet  Because they know  I believe that people  That are that bug nutty crazy  Have a little part of them  Going  You're just fucking  Yeah  Well we started the show  Trying to figure out  How many end of the world  Scenarios we've survived already  I think we're up to  Four or five 
[01:40:30]  Well no  Yeah  Even in our lifetimes  The Y2K  You got this one  You got the guy  That said it was May  Then he said it was October  So that's two weeks of ride  Well you know  Randy has  I forget what book it is  But Amazing Randy  Has in the back of one of his books  An appendix  Of about  You know  Several pages  Oh really he does  That explains where  The ends of the world  Were  Because it's very clear  In the New Testament  That Jesus  Considers the end of the world  To be coming  Weeks  Months  After  After he 
[01:41:00]  Dies  So I mean  That was what  Christianity was  And then that didn't happen  And they just kind of went  Well just kind of do this  But you know  They're always  They're always talking  Into the world  And trying to figure it out  Was Christ really off  By 2,000 years  I didn't realize that  Well we don't know yet  He could be off by longer  We don't even know  When he was  That's true  Hopefully right  I don't know  We don't even know  When he was born anymore  We're starting to fool around  With that date  Yeah I don't think  We ever knew  But we always knew  It wasn't December  They were just  Tacking that on  To the solstice 
[01:41:30]  So they could  You know  You get a party  You already go  And add something  Make it all nice  Yeah  Make it all nice and neat  I saw that on the History Channel  Yeah sure  You know  The story of Christmas  It's a good fucking watch  Wasn't it April or something  He was born?  They're starting to say  Around April I think  And they usually say  About 3 B.C.  But that's if  You believe there was  An historic Jesus  And there probably was  Because it was a time  When there were lots of nuts  Right  Running around  Saying crazy shit  Yeah  And my question  About Jesus 
[01:42:00]  Is that nothing  And most scholars  Will argue about  The amount of time  So don't bust me on that  But pretty much  Nothing was written down  About Jesus  Until about 300 years  About 300 years  Later  After he died  And my thinking is  Elvis was alive  During my lifetime  And there's an electronic record  And things were written  Every day he was alive  Right  About him  And look  Elvis didn't do no drugs  No no  We have  We actually have 
[01:42:30]  He didn't do no drugs  Elvis did not do no drugs  No we have video  Of him doing more drugs  We have video  Of him taking  Handfuls of persons  He don't do no drugs  So if things can  Just change that much  You think the story's  A little off  In 40 years  Right  What is it doing 300  When no one can write shit down  And a generation  In about 35 years  And when you look  How much do things morph  You look at things  That have been proven  And disproven  Over the years  Through science  In that time period 
[01:43:00]  And it's astounding  How little they knew  Back then  But all that stuff  Just happens to be  The truth  And that's good stuff  Weren't they voted on  The stories  Like the stories  That became the bible  300 years BC  Like American Idol  Pretty much  The most popular stories  To be told  In sermons  They voted on  The canon  What are they called  The canon voted  Yeah  There's a bunch of stories  They just blew off  And put it together  They decided  His childhood  These aren't as important  His whole childhood's gone  This whole chapter  That said 
[01:43:30]  Don't ever give money  To the church  Let's get that out of there  That's going away  That's going  People do not like that  Have you noticed that  It doesn't play  In the churches  Let's get rid of it  I read your book  I told you  Before you started  And I said it was great  I got to the end  Which is a compliment  Because we try to read  A lot of books  And you get halfway through  You're like  I'm done  I'm moving on to the next one  I really liked your book  I want to ask you  About Christmas though  You've got a couple  Small kids  And you don't celebrate  Christmas  Because you're an atheist  It's kind of a  Complete half-ass cheat 
[01:44:00]  That we do  But my point  And then you can go with it  Is that  I think most of us  Don't even look at Christmas  As a religious holiday  No I don't think  If it weren't for my wife  Right  Who's an absolute nut  About it  You know  I would probably  Do Christmas  Just fairly normal  But my wife is just  Whatever you find  That I believe  My wife believes  It ten times more  Wow  Every single time  I speak  She considers me  To be kind of a sellout  You know what I mean  Why didn't you tell them 
[01:44:30]  To shut the fuck up  What do you mean  Christmas isn't  A religious holiday  How'd you let them  Say that  It's the same thing  I mean I have to  You know  My daughter's middle name  Is Crimefighter  Right  Moxie Crimefighter Gillette  And everybody says  You know  Here's this crazy performer  Giving his child  The crazy middle name  It's not the way  It happened  I mean I have to defend it  But not the way  It happened at all  My wife doesn't have  A middle name  She hates middle names  I said okay 
[01:45:00]  Moxie's a name  We agree on  What do you think  For a middle name  She said fuck middle names  I don't have middle names  And I don't know  Your middle name  I'm married to you  I don't know  Your middle name  She said it doesn't matter  I said I just thought  It'd be nice  She said okay  I don't care  And then we're in the  We're backstage  And we're with our  Piano player  Jonesy  And I'd just written  This novel  Sock  During which  One of the characters  Says  From now on  Call me Crimefighter  So Jonesy  My piano player  Goes well it doesn't matter  Call her Crimefighter  And my wife goes  You wanted a middle name  You got it  It's Crimefighter 
[01:45:30]  That's it  And I said well I just thought  We could kind of bag her  She said no no  I didn't want a middle name  You did  Jonesy Says Crimefighter  Moxie Crimefighter  Gillette  I said oh okay  That's great  And then  For eight years  I have to defend it  Right right  You know  I've been with these guys  A long time  I don't know their middle names  Exactly  Your side with my wife  And I don't have  A middle name officially  So I'm in that world  Yeah so there you go  I like it  Has your wife influenced you  Like because I don't know  And it's like you're  A very strong personality  And a big personality  So you kind of have to be 
[01:46:00]  Married to somebody  Who's got a certain  Strength to them  And has she kind of  Influenced you  And taken you from say  Six to seven  As far as your beliefs  I think we kind of  I think we kind of  Do it to each other  But she backs down less  I think because  Well because she's  Stronger maybe  But also because  I spend more time  With people who have  Different opinions  I mean I  I went to Dallas  And did Glenn Beck's show  Right right  I went to his studio  Spent time with Glenn Beck  How was that?  And it was amazing  First of all 
[01:46:30]  I don't know what he's doing  I guess he  On the side  He doesn't know what he's doing  No no  Well he has  First of all  His chalkboard  Has five colors of chalk on it  Yeah  And you know  My thinking is  If you have a theory  That takes five colors of chalk  To explain  You're crazy  It's as easy  I mean count  Those of you who are working  On your kind of  Unified field theory at home  Sure  And I know that those who are  Are listening to this show  There's no doubt about that  Sure  And you want to lay out your theory  If you get to like  Three colors of chalk 
[01:47:00]  Just say to yourself  I'm fucking whack chalk  Because you know  Einstein  Equals MC squared  Special relativity  One color right  One color chalk  One color chalk  Does that change the world  Chalk  How do you know  It's all black and white photos  It could be yellows and greens  But you don't see  You don't see little graphs  But you know  You go on a Glenn Beck show  And there is  A chalkboard  And there's five colors of chalk  This is where the conservatives  Have been going  And this is where the  And here's where the  Founding fathers were  And he's got this studio 
[01:47:30]  That's the size of a gymnasium  With you know  Jibs coming in  Right right  And all this stuff  And then these people  It's agoraphobic  It's so big  It's this huge  It's like doing this show  In a beautiful  Wood paneled airplane hanger  And then he goes on  And we get along fabulously  Yeah  Fabulously  And then he has questions  You know  People raise their hands  And ask questions like  What does the word atheist mean  I mean  I've never been  They've never been in a room 
[01:48:00]  With someone like me  Wow  And we just get along great  You know  And I go and do that  And my wife just kind of goes  You know he's a Mormon  I go yes  I know he's a Mormon  But you were on there  Kind of a  I didn't agree with  Any of the Mormon shit  I was just nice to him  But my wife is very  You know my wife is  She's like  Why are you not  Stomping Glenn back  She's what  She plays golf  She's like a five handicap  From the men's tees  No  She plays poker 
[01:48:30]  Holy shit  She plays poker  And she's like the man  How did you meet her  After the show  She came up  And I mean  Just waited around  After the show  In order to have sex with me  Really  That was her plan  And her way of making  That move  Was to come up  And say  You know Penn  I was having dinner  The other night  With Richard Dawkins  We were talking  Dope  She said Richard Dawkins  And she had me  Who's Richard Dawkins  Because Richard Dawson  Would have gotten me  Because I was such a fan 
[01:49:00]  Of the show  He's an atheist guy  He's one of the biggies  He is the  I don't know if he still is  But he was  He's the Jesus of atheism  Yeah  He was the Darwin chair  At Oxford  When you  I have things with my ex  When we were talking  There's certain subjects  She would bring up  And I could feel my blood boiling  Because it's like  We've already gone through this  Oh wow  And it's like  I was never able to  Back out of an argument  And just let her  Have her  Argument or discussion  It became an argument  Because I was so annoyed  That she was  We just hit each other wrong  How do you avoid that shit  Like if you're both  Very strong personalities 
[01:49:30]  If you feel your wife  Getting heated about it  Will you at times  Go  It's not worth it  Alright  Yes  You will  Yeah  I'd back down  I think every married guy  Has to go through that  You've got to decide  What hill you're willing  To die on  Just like anyone else  That's it man  You know  Yeah  So you guys  You know  I once had a discussion  I was sitting around  With a big group of people  We were in Vegas  And we were talking about  And I love this  This should be a book 
[01:50:00]  We were talking about  Arguments that people had  When they were breaking up  That what the argument  Was actually about  I mean not  What the words were  Right  Not what the subtext was  And one guy said  That he was driving back  From Vegas  And got into a screaming match  That ended up  Breaking up with his wife  And the subject was  If Priscilla started dating  Too soon after Elvis died  That's where it started  Wow  You gave us a great radio bit 
[01:50:30]  We're going with that one  The other one that I heard  Was that another guy said  It was not his wife  It was a girlfriend  And they were arguing  And really violent  And you can't understand this  Unless you've been in one of these  He hit an animal in the road  And he said he'd hit a possum  And she said it was a raccoon  And that turned into  The big discussion  That ended up  That broke the marriage  And I think that  That you know  Don't care 
[01:51:00]  You don't ever want to find  What's behind  No no  Because that's real  She was afraid  I was cheating on her  Or you know  There was money problems  I want to know  What the actual  Court transcript says  I want to know  When you bring that  In front of the judge  And he says  What were you arguing about  Right  The transcript  Is going to be read back  And say  You said that  Priscilla should have waited  A year and a half  Before dating  And your wife said  That a year was okay  Yeah  Is that what the subject  Was about  Well no you're on  No no  What do the words say 
[01:51:30]  What do the  Well we talked about  Nothing but Elvis and Priscilla  And how soon she was dating  Because it's always about  Something deeper  But that's the interesting part  Is what was started  What was it  Everybody  When you're sitting around  Talking to people  You always go to  What were you really  Talking about  And all of a sudden  It came to me  Like a diamond bullet  In the forehead  That's not what I care about  I know what you were  Really fighting about  You were really fighting  About sex and money  That's all  But what I want to know  Is what you thought  You were fighting about  Because that's what  Tells what's in your heart 
[01:52:00]  The fact that you were  Willing to go to the mats  Over whether that was  A fucking possum  It was a possum  You could tell  It was a possum  There's nothing worse  Than having to  Back down with your wife  Or girlfriend  When you know you're right  But like you said  You gotta pick your battles  And shit  But there are just times  I remember when I was married  Oh my god  I used to have to  Back down constantly  Because she was  Fucking brutal  Just vicious  Vicious  And she could keep  A fucking argument going  Man  She yelled  Like the JDL 
[01:52:30]  It was crazy man  Yeah  She was awful  So no Christmas tree  For the kids  If they ask for it  I really want to know  How an atheist  Celebrates Christmas  What we do  Is we do a  We do a big thing  On New Year's Day  Right  And the children  Just all gear up  To New Year's Day  And it ends up  Being very  Financially feasible  Because they get to see  What the friends got  You know  The Jewish and Christian  Friends already got  They get to find out  What the children  Threw out  What they really like 
[01:53:00]  So if the children  Get like six Skylanders  We just have to come in  Over the top with seven  You know  We get to lay it all out  See what it is  And come in with  Much better presence  We get to learn  So you move it to  We just move it  A few days later  It's exactly  Exactly the same thing  And they don't feel  They don't feel at all  Like they've been slighted  They haven't yet  You know  They're six and seven  And we've got no complaints  And last year  I think one of them said  You know  They drive by the tree places  All the time  You know  We'd like to have a tree  And we said  Okay  There's not really 
[01:53:30]  A big deal about it  There's always a big deal  Over my daughter  I would love to see her  In the little holiday show  They do at school  Sure yeah  And my wife kind of  Rolls her eyes at that  And Moxie kind of chooses  I go  You can sing  Whatever  You sing away in the manger  That's fine  You can sing whatever you want  You know  Bach wrote really good music  Ray Charles did too  They were both religious  You can sing away in the manger  You can sing Silent Night  Which our school doesn't have 
[01:54:00]  But I'm using advanced examples  And my wife's kind of like  She doesn't have to do that  And then Moxie kind of decides  And this year  She's deciding  That she  Actually  I was feeling really guilty  About doing your show  Because the Christmas thing  Is today  And I wouldn't get back for it  And I said to Moxie  So you're doing the Christmas thing  She said  No  It's all Christmas  I don't want to do the Christmas  I said  So you're not going to appear  On stage at all  She said  No  I said  Are you sure of that right now  She said  Yes  And you don't want to change your mind 
[01:54:30]  She said  No  I said  I'll be doing opening Anthony  I like it  These couple days  You've been on the road  I think your wife  Really went to work on her  Yeah right  A couple things from your book  If you don't mind  I loved reading about  Your experience  On The Celebrity Apprentice  And how you pretty much  Faked it  You made kind of  An agreement with Mr. Trump  That you wouldn't be  A problem  A problem  It's not really  You know  Trump is  A really fascinating guy  Now I've done it 
[01:55:00]  Although I can't talk about it  Too much  I've done another season of it  So I've gotten to know Trump  Yeah I'm on the All Stars  Oh great  Then maybe I shouldn't  Bring this up  No I can tell you  A little bit  It's fascinating  Because you know  Thelonious Monk  Great jazz piano player  Has this list  It's not well known  But there's this little list  That he gave to members  Of his band  On how to play  Which includes  The greatest advice  To musicians ever  One of them that I love is 
[01:55:30]  Don't play the piano part  I'm playing the piano part  Because you know  He would play  These wonderful things  And the sax player  Would come in  And play what he had just played  Don't play the piano part  I'm playing the piano part  And then at the bottom of it  He says  The genius is the one  Who is most like himself  That's his definition of genius  The one that is most like himself  It's hard to wrap your mind around  Reading that  And being around Trump  Trump is purely Trump 
[01:56:00]  And when you sit in that boardroom  And he does go on  For two or three hours  And you sit in the boardroom  You have to sit there  For two or three hours  And they only show what  Five minutes on TV  Yeah and you're sitting there  And he's talking  And  Every week  Yeah  Or you know  I know TV time  But whatever  Every other day  Yeah  Three hours  Sometimes  Sometimes an hour and a half  And the thing is  That at first  When I first got there  You know  It's a foreign environment  And you're all jacked up  And you wonder  If he's going to call on you 
[01:56:30]  And what do you think  Of Clay Aiken  And you're running through  All the scenarios  And then you realize  That there are  Twelve other people  In the room  And your chances  Of being called on  Are very slim  And if you are called on  What you have to say  Is not very much  Well Mr. Trump  You know  We did the best we could  Thank you Mr. Trump  That's about all  You're going to say  So all of a sudden  This kind of calm  Came over me  And it was like  Listening to this  Really  I mean there's  I believe that 
[01:57:00]  Any person  Alone  Just talking  Off the top of their head  With no filters  And no censorship  Is fascinating  And the reason  When you work on radio  What you're learning to do  Is trying to get  Your filters  In place  So that you keep  Your job  Right  But yet you still  Have this passion  That flows  Compelling  And you see that  People have real trouble  Doing that  Either they can't put  Any filters on  And they just  Burn out  Or they've got 
[01:57:30]  So many filters on  It's like  Well great day isn't it  Yeah it is  Giving up nothing  Yeah  But that combination  Of I know  That there's a microphone  On me  And I also want to  Break down  What I'm going to say  You know  But you get to see him  With no filters  Yeah you get to see him  With no filters  And it's really  Because the version  We see on TV  It certainly has a few filters  Sure  But when you get to see  Just what's popping up  In his head  It's just fascinating  And getting to see 
[01:58:00]  Does he talk about stuff  That has nothing  To do with the show  Nothing  Like what  Can you give me  A couple examples  He'll talk about  Real estate deals  That he had that day  He'll talk about  An argument he had  With a friend of his  And it's just fabulous  Oh my god  You gotta sit there  I think that the show  Would be  Even better  If they left in  Some of that stuff  Big chunks of that  Because for me  The Trump stuff  They always talk about  On TV  You know  You want  Not to just be  Talking heads  You want some action 
[01:58:30]  But for me  A person speaking  From their heart  Especially an eccentric person  I can listen to  Forever  You know what I mean  If you just gave me  Neil Young  You know  With a microphone  And just  Twelve people  Sitting there  Not talking back to him  And him talking  For three hours  I would watch that  Anytime  And that's part  Of what  So the problem  With me not being  Able to dig Trump  Was just having  All my own shit  Right  And by the time  I got to show 
[01:59:00]  Five or six  And went  You know  This has got  Nothing to do with me  It's not about me  Yeah yeah  I'm just getting  To sit here  And you know  It's really important  Like you know  Like I kept saying  Over and over again  You know  If it were the 60s  You know  I want to be near  What's going on  If it were the 60s  I would want to be  On Ed Sullivan  And when the Beatles  Did Ed Sullivan  The act after the Beatles  Was a magician  It was Billy McComb  That's who I want to be  After the whole thing 
[01:59:30]  Is over  Everything's torn down  Boom  The Beatles have hit  Everybody's remembered that  A guy's gonna come out  And do a schmuck magic act  I want to be that guy  What was  I have to stop you  For a second  What was his trick  The trick  He made himself obscure  I didn't know  That a magician  Came on after the Beatles  For that famous  Fucking viewers  Disappeared  Before or after  What kind of trick  Did he do  I think he  I think it was  Billy McComb  And I think he was  Doing his little  A very talky trick  I think with silks 
[02:00:00]  And a very nice routine  Old school right  And people  And I used to talk to him  About it  He has the autographed  Pictures of the Beatles  And he was the perfect age  Because the Beatles  Were 20  And he was just about 40  A working pro  A really working pro  So he says  Yeah  I'm gonna go  He was Scottish  I'm gonna go on that show  And the Beatles  Are gonna be on before me  And his niece  And everything  Get real excited 
[02:00:30]  And he gets some tickets  And stuff  And then he's backstage  And this history moment  Is happening  Absolute history  And then that whole thing  Ed Sullivan  Thank you boys  And they leave  There goes history  And someone  Has to come out on stage  So I would  Would you want to  Follow the Beatles  Yes  Yes  More than anything  I want to  I want to be the guy  Who's forgotten  I want to be near  You know you say  To your friends  What was it like backstage  I know  Yeah yeah  I know what it was like  Backstage  I was there  Trying to get through  The groupies 
[02:01:00]  Going  Don't touch those cards  They're stacked  Just don't touch the cards  You can  Take your clothes off  And throw them over there  But this deck of cards  Is stacked  Very important  That you leave that alone  Leave that alone  You can do whatever  You know  Fall down  Have an orgasm  Drag Paul's feet  Across the room  But just don't touch  This little table  You know that  And if  If you're talking about  The 21st century  That Sunday night  Is Donald Trump  Donald Trump  Is Ed Sullivan 
[02:01:30]  And Gary Busey  Is the Beatles  There's no doubt  That 30 years from now  If anyone's talking  About Celebrity Apprentice  They're saying nothing  Except Gary Busey  So when I got to go on again  And be on with Gary Busey  I was like  Oh boy  I'm the magician  Who's on after the Beatles  Because you know  Because you know  That Gary Busey  Is just going to  Just spill out  This nutty poetry  Right  And you know  With some of those shots  I'll be sitting next to him  That's all I want 
[02:02:00]  Out of my life  That's all you need  And it turns out  On Celebrity Apprentice  That who you are with  Is all that matters  The show  Is completely honest  They don't edit it  Disingenuously  They don't cheat  They do all the stuff  That paranoid people say  That they're holding back meals  And stopping the sleep  All that's bullshit  They really do exactly  What they say they're doing  Trump really is exactly  That's not really true  If you get Trump off camera  He's nicer  He's more of a regular guy  Right 
[02:02:30]  He doesn't want you to know  That he wants to be  An interesting TV character  Yeah  And his way of doing that  Is by being you know  Intense and mean  And he plays that up  So he gets a lot softer  And cooler  And more human  When you're  But that's not really  A big cheat  That's not a big lie  Right  And it goes  Through pretty  Straightforwardly  But if you're stuck  In a room  With Clay Aiken  Oh no  For 60 hours  There is some damage  That gets done  You know  When he wants to have  Heart to heart talks 
[02:03:00]  Well that's what I love  In the book  I'm glad you're getting  Getting to it  Well you know  Clay Aiken  Sent him down  To have a little  Heart to heart  I'm from New England  Okay  I'm from  And that doesn't mean much  But my parents were older  You know  My mom was 45  When I was born  So I'm born  Of another generation  Of New Englanders  And Greenfield  Massachusetts  Little town up there  On my mother's deathbed  She was dying  On her deathbed  I sat there  Next to her  And said  You know mom  I really love you 
[02:03:30]  She said  Why are you saying that  Of course you love me  You know  And when I came home  If I'd been gone  You know  A month  You know  Over in China  My parents hadn't seen me  When I came in  I could hug  My mom  And then  Hug my dad  And then that was it  For the trip  You know  If I was there  For four days  That was the hug  You got  That was it  And then you hug goodbye  And I'd bring home  Girlfriends  You know  From California  Who'd meet my mom 
[02:04:00]  The first time  And hug her  And my mom  Would say afterwards  Tell your girlfriend  Not to hug me  Wow  I don't know her  Wow  And it meant a lot  When I'm telling that story  You know  There's no one  I've been closer to  In my life  Than my mom  When I tell that story  About of course you love me  I hope you understand  That I'm not talking  About some cold bitch  Right  I'm talking about somebody  That to say it  Was a little bit of an insult  Because it was just so true 
[02:04:30]  Okay  To her it was like saying  There's air in the room  Unnecessary to say  Air in the room  You know  So when I decided  To get married  It was about a  45 minute discussion  With my wife  Maybe half an hour  When I decided  To work with Teller  For our entire lives  We had a discussion  That went about 20 minutes  Deciding to have children  Deciding to have children  You know  Talking to my wife  And saying  You know  Because our children  Were very planned  Because our daughter  Is a test tube baby  You know  So it wasn't a question 
[02:05:00]  Of just fucking  It was a question  Of you know  We're going to spend  $30,000  And so that discussion  Was less than  A half an hour  We're going to have  Children raise them  Together  Seriously  And then  With eight cameras  On me  Clay Aiken sits down  For an hour and a half  To talk about  How much eye contact  I'm making  The Lou Ferrigno  So you've got  You've got  A New England guy  So he sits down  And he goes  Oh my god  Well first of all 
[02:05:30]  He says  You kind of talk over  Lou Ferrigno's head  You're really condescending  Now all I want to say  To him is  Condescending means  To talk down to  If you're talking  Over someone's head  You're a prick  But you're not condescending  It's a different thing  The word you want  Clay  Is arrogant  Insensitive  Prick  Would be great  Prick is a fine word here  You know  Condescending is the wrong word  But it turns out  When someone is calling you  Condescending 
[02:06:00]  Correcting their use  Of the word  Condescending  Counterproductive  Of course  Doesn't really help  To go  I'm sorry  You don't really understand  What condescending means  Maybe he didn't understand  Why Lou kept saying  What  What  An hour and a half  With that guy  He says to me  You know  So  Don't  Don't do that  That much  And I say  Which  Is the way  I was brought up  I say  Okay  I know that bothers you  It won't happen anymore  The stuff you just explained  I won't do anymore 
[02:06:30]  And of course  The truth is  And it's on video  From the moment he says that  I don't do any of the things  He complains about  Ever again for the whole show  Oh really  To the point  The producers  Complained to me  And I said  Well I told Clay  I wouldn't  So that  That is a full  Three minutes of the conversation  And that is really cool  Like if you took me outside  Here  When the mics were off  And you said  You know  When you come on the show  Penn  There's this thing you do  That bugs me  And you explained it to me  And it wasn't  Outside of my morality  I would go  Okay  And then the discussion's over 
[02:07:00]  We don't like the whole  Denying God thing Penn  We wanted to talk  Well then we'd have  A little bigger discussion  It scares the shit  Out of all of us  Okay  But  So then Clay  Has to talk  Another hour and a half  And the weird thing  About Celebrity Apprentice  Is  And this is something  You guys will not  Be able to understand  But I want you to  Try to wrap  Because we'll never be  On the show  Is that what you're saying  No no no no  Because we'll never be  On the show  If you're on the show  You'll understand it  It's not reality  And it's also not TV 
[02:07:30]  And that's the part  That's really hard  As we sit here talking  You are aware  That every breath  You're taking  Is going out to people  Yeah  You're very aware of that  And you also know  It's not a real situation  We're not just sitting around  Having a cup of colas  Right  But you also know  That it's going out live  Now imagine  If you do this show  And you do  Ten hours of it  Ten hours straight  Without a break  And you don't know  What three minutes 
[02:08:00]  They're using  So you have to  Constantly think  But then you know  So the hour and a half  That I'm talking to Clay  I know  Is it going to be on TV  And yet  Any individual  Instant of it  Might be  Me rolling my eyes  Me going  Shut the fuck up  Any of that  So it's very different  I mean  Doing an hour  On Piers Morgan  Where you know  The cameras are there  And it's all going out  You can kind of judge 
[02:08:30]  How you're coming off  Like you're sitting there  And you're going to  You know  You're thinking  We'll let Penn go this long  And then I'm going to  Interject this  And geez  Better get a fucking joke  In there somewhere  It's been a while  Without a joke  What can we stick in  All that's going through your head  Imagine all that's  Taken away from you  Wow yeah  That's fucked up man  And I add to that  That they don't cheat  There's no cheating  They're not going to  Take an eye roll  Out of one conversation  Put another  They don't do that  They're completely honest  Completely straightforward  Right  But the situation  Imagine you get up 
[02:09:00]  At 5 a.m.  And you have  12 cameras on you  From 6 a.m.  To 10 p.m.  12 cameras  And then you're  Surrounded by people  Who you didn't  Choose to be around  I mean  The five of us  In this room  They do 10 hours  With cameras on us  I think we do  Pretty good  Now bring in  Don Johnson  Just put him  Into there  Like a little bit  A little bit of  Carbon to the reactor  You know  The five of us  Are doing great  We probably would be  Excited for the first hour 
[02:09:30]  Maybe two  And then we still  Have eight hours  With Don Johnson  You can be  Excited for the first  40 hours  Right  And it still  Won't be over  Gotcha  Got your point  You know  You don't have to  Say an hour  You know  It's gonna go forever  And if you get  Someone like  Gary Busey  Who other people  Found annoying  I just love it  Because it's this  Pure kind of flow  Of you know  Like dancing  Near the diamond sky  With one arm  Waving free  Is it total genuine  From him  Because he's such  A good actor  Like when you realize  He does know 
[02:10:00]  How to be structured  When he acts  And he can memorize  Lies  He's a brilliant actor  There's some stuff  Going on there  So this craziness  In real life  Is actually organic  I believe  I believe  That Gary is  As much as anybody  As true to himself  As possible  Now there's  There's  There's a time  When you're aware  Of what you're doing  You know  But I mean  He is certainly  More honest  On camera  To who he actually is  Than any of us  In this room  Have ever been  You know  You know  You're pretty much 
[02:10:30]  Yourself on here  But he does less  Than you do  To bring it together  In front of a mic  So who are you doing  Celebrity Apprentice  The all stars with  Are you allowed to say yet  I'm allowed to say  It's been announced  Oh it was  Yeah  So it's  But I don't know  If I'll be able  To remember  In the right order  Lee Serena  Who I absolutely  Love love love love love  Yeah  Gary Busey  Dennis Rodman  Latoya Jackson  Brett Michaels  Dee Snyder  Dee's great  Dee  Yeah  Oh right 
[02:11:00]  Okay  Yeah  And then  Boy  Omarosa  Who else was there  Some playboy woman  That I never got to  Really  Brandy  Would never get to  Really work with  She was on  Different teams  And  Oh  Stephen Baldwin  Oh yeah  So we're  Oh wow  I get to talk  I talk a lot of  Scripture  With Stephen Baldwin  And at one point  I'm talking to him  And we're talking  About  We're talking about  The Bible  And we're talking  It's a great moment  Because I'm talking 
[02:11:30]  About John  And I'm saying  That my major problem  With the Bible  Is that  One of my major problems  Is that  Jesus is so anti-family  Jesus says in several places  Put your family aside  And follow me  Your family doesn't matter  Come follow me  Leave them behind  Follow me  And I said  I believe my family  Is more important than that  I don't know why  Christians talk about  Family values  When throughout  The new  And he says  Where is that  That you're talking about  And I said  Well I'm talking  It's throughout 
[02:12:00]  The new testament  But it's mostly  In John  And he says to me  Well do you have  Any verses  That you know  Off hand  And I say  Yeah  The one that's  Tattooed on the  Back of your neck  And he has  3.30 tattooed  On the back of his neck  And then he quotes it to me  And I go  See  What is 3.30  It's the one that says  Don't worry about yourself  Or being you  Or following what you believe  You must put that aside  And follow me  And I said 
[02:12:30]  Putting aside your own heart  And doing this  But you know  I'm putting it in  In abstract terms  It's not the exact  But you know  He has biblical stuff  Tattooed on  And you know  Baldwin would spend  His time going  It's so weird  That the only one  Who knows  What my religious tattoos  Mean on this show  Is the atheist  But I got along  I got along great  With Stephen Baldwin  You know  And if you want to hear  Stories  On Usual Suspects  Which I do  They're there  If you want to hear 
[02:13:00]  Stories about him  Converting to Jesus  Which I kind of didn't  You still hear those too  But it's just  It's just fascinating  You know  The youngest Baldwin  It's amazing  That it's so much  Better to be educated  About something  That you're against  Not necessarily against  But don't believe in  Have an opposing  Point of view  It's so much easier  To be very educated  In that  To have a  Constructive argument  With somebody  Discussion  Do you understand 
[02:13:30]  The irony of what  You're hearing right now  Yeah  Do you have any idea  How everyone  In the radio audience  Is going  Who the fuck  Just said that  Are you  I'm very educated  When I have a  Viewpoint  No because  Obviously  Also talking about  Gun control issues  Oh yeah  This week  Everybody's  Talking about it  And  Like a lot of  People that are  For gun control  Have very little  Knowledge about  Guns  And what  Their purposes  Are 
[02:14:00]  Yeah  I was going  On  Wendy Williams  Yesterday  And I said  To my  My managers  I was going  On  I said  Do you think  That I should  Do nothing  During this  Interview  Except correct  Them on  Magazine and  Clip  And the differences  I said  Would that  Appear to be  Callous  If I just  Said  You know  A magazine  And a clip  It has to do  With the  Spraying  And loaded  And  But yes  It's a time  What  I was  So bothered  About 
[02:14:30]  Was  On both  Sides  Without  Talking about  The issues  At all  People  Jumping in  To make  Their political  Points  I just  Was like  You know  We don't  Need to  Hear from  You now  Except that  I'm sorry  Yeah  It's all  We really  Need to  Hear  And also  The press  Turning it  Into this  24 hour  Thing  You know  My children  I didn't  Have the  TV on  At all  But you  Know  And there  Were  These articles  Everywhere  About how  To talk  To your  Children  About this  How you  Talk to  Your children 
[02:15:00]  About this  Is you  Don't  Talk to  Them  There's  No  Reason  For them  To think  About this  It's  It's a  Tragedy  But it's  A tragedy  That's also  An anomaly  It's not  Going to  Happen  In their  School  It's just  It's a  Very  Very  Small  Number  Which is  Why we're  So appalled  And obviously  And obviously  This happening  To one  Child  Is infinitely  Too many  Right  That being  Said  It does  Not mean  That your  75 million  Children  In the  Country  Are at  Risk 
[02:15:30]  From this  And they  Don't need  To be  Petrified  No  Going into  School  Yeah  And I  And you  Know they  Said you  Know that  The school  Was going  To bring  It up  A little  Bit  And my  Children  Did  And I  Said to my  Children  I said  This can't  Happen  To you  You know  And in  Some of  The articles  They were  Saying you  Know you  Can't tell  Them you  Can keep  Them safe  From this  And I'm  Reading the  Article going  Yes I  Can  Yeah I  Can  Yes I  Really can  The odds  Are good  They will  Be safe  From that  Yeah  Overwhelming  It's horrifying 
[02:16:00]  As a parent  Though  As a parent  Did that  Just bother  You at all  Of course  But you  Know what  You really  Want to worry  About  Of course  You know  This very  Well  Is you  Want to worry  About drowning  And you  Want to worry  About prescription  Medicines  You know  That's  You know  We lose  About two  Children a  Day  Drowning in  Backyard pools  That's a real  Number  And that  Can happen  And it's  Just that  You know  Trying to do  That triage  And that  Priority  Without losing  Any of the  Compassion  You know 
[02:16:30]  Any of the  Compassion  At all  And also  You know  I was on  When I was  On Wendy  Williams  There was  What was  Her take  On it  By the way  You know  The usual  You know  We have to  Ban  Assault  Reapons  And then  She was  Also  Quoting  Jamie Foxx  About how  Our entertainment  Is too  Violent  And then  Sue Simmons  Who was  On  Said  Well you know  You have  Somebody who's  Mentally ill  With Asperger's  Syndrome  And let them  Play video  Games  And I went  I went  Crazy  I was probably  I was probably  I was probably 
[02:17:00]  Inappropriate  On the show  I was probably  Too aggressive  Because I said  You got a great  Take on violent  Video games  Asperger's  Syndrome  I said  There's no  Correlation  With violence  Whatsoever  None  We don't  Have to be  And she said  Well you know  There's something  Wrong with them  We have to  I said  No Asperger's  Syndrome  People live  Among us  And we love  Them  And they're  Our families  And there's  No  There's no  Reason  You shouldn't  Even say  That  Yes  The shooter  Probably had  Asperger's  But it's like 
[02:17:30]  Saying he was  Blonde or something  I mean  It is so much  Worse  Than the worst  Kind of racism  To say  That the people  Among us  Who need  Our help  And need  Our love  And need  Our support  And are not  In any way  Violent  There's no  I mean  There's no  Correlation  There isn't  A fucking  Data point  You can't  Say  Well you know  They do  You know  With schizophrenia  You can say  There's very  Very  Very few  Cases  But you know 
[02:18:00]  It's a little  Higher  In the  Schizophrenic  It's only  A little  It's so  Low  It's just  A really  An RCH  It's just  Barely there  You know  But  Asperger's  If anything  It's negatively  Correlated  You're the only  One that says  That word  Properly  By the way  Is that  Proper  I think  So  I don't  I think  That's how  You say  I say  Asperger's  That's what  I say  It's fun  To say  To pretend  There's two  Words  Put together  Like  Snicker  So  Snicker isn't  Two words  Put together 
[02:18:30]  No but  I snicker  I think you  Ass in burgers  I just snicker  Your take on  Your take on  Violent video games  I know you did  A whole episode  On bullshit  Well you know  The thing is  It's just  Another way  For grownups  To dislike  Their children  I mean  All I think  About is  You remember  That clip  That we all  Saw  A million  Billion  Times  Rock and roll  Has got to go  And the guy  Smashing the record  And we all  Laugh our asses  Off  And then they  Show you  On hail hail  Rock and roll  And those 
[02:19:00]  Kind of documentaries  That were all  Out in the  70s and 80s  If you watch  Those again  They show  These like  Southern  Big headed  Fat guys  Saying you  Know  It's the devil's  Music  It's the devil's  Music  And they do  All that  Kind of shit  And then  When Hillary  Clinton  Comes out  And says  We've got to  Stop these  Violent video  Games  People  Our age  You know  Kind of go  Well she's a  Little over the  Top  No  She's rock and  Roll  Is good to go  She's insane  Yes  This shooter  Did play  Call of Duty  You know why 
[02:19:30]  Because every  Motherfucker  Under 30  Plays Call of Duty  More people  Play Call of Duty  Than eat pussy  More people  Play Call of Duty  Than drink milk  Every single  Motherfucker  You know  Who's under  The age of 25  Has played  Call of Duty  In the past  Three days  There's no  Exceptions  They sold  16 million games  In two days  In two fucking days  60 million  So when you say  You know  Mom  Everyone's listening  To the Beatles  Nothing  Compared to 
[02:20:00]  Call of Duty  So what you've got  Is let's see  The percentage  Of people  Who are doing  Who are watching  Call of Duty  It's totally  Un-fucking-related  It's just like  Saying you know  You're watching  The Shakespeare  Stuff and  Shakespeare has  These underage  Teen suicides  What's this  Going to do  Fuck you  Nothing  It's art  People know  The difference  My children  Five years old  Watched the  Stooges  And knew the  Stooges  Weren't really  Gouging each 
[02:20:30]  Other's eyes out  Of course  Turns out  They really  Were  But that's not  Important  Doesn't change  My point  So the thing  Is there's  This desperate  Attempt  And it makes  Me fucking  Nuts  This desperate  Attempt  And I believe  This is one  Of those things  That Americans  Do more  Than the rest  Of the country  There's this  Desperate attempt  When there's  Something terrible  To blame  Something other  Than the person  We know  As the perpetrator  Charlie Manson  You know  Blame the hippie  Movement  No  Blame LSD 
[02:21:00]  No  Blame the Times  No  Blame fucking  Charlie Manson  He carved a  Swastik into his  Forehead  What the fuck  More do you need  We don't need to  Blame Manson  Blame Tex Watson  And Squeaky  And that  We still haven't  Blamed him really  Exactly  Exactly  Exactly  How about  We blame the  Person  And then to  Say  That because  Every single  Quality this  Guy has  You cast  Aspersions  On everybody  Else  Especially the  Asperger  Asperger's 
[02:21:30]  People  Who are  Struggling  With so many  Things to fit  In  I mean  They're  Having  You know  This is not  This is not  A secret  I'm not telling  Tales out of  School  But I'm a little  Hesitant to say it  But I will  Anyway  On my podcast  Penn Sunday  School  Ready Rich  Who runs  The board  Has Asperger's  Syndrome  And was  Special schools  And everything  Else  And works  Really hard 
[02:22:00]  And he's  One of these  Guys who  Has to count  The amount  Of time  He makes  Eye contact  With you  So he  Appears  Normal  You know  He has  To do  I do  Six seconds  Of eye  Contact  With you  Then I  Can go  To someone  Else  In the  Room  He has  To do  That  Kind  Of  Stuff  He is  So brutally  Honest  That he  Has to  Be careful  You know  Because he  Will tell  You the  Truth  Whether you  Want it  Or not  And he  Has  You know  And it's  A spectrum  There's all  Different qualities  But I mean  He's serious  He's not  Someone that  Has just  You know  Just a touch 
[02:22:30]  Of that  Weirdness  How long  Did they come  Out with  Knowing what  That was  Asperger's  Asperger's  How long  Has that been  A diagnosis  Not long  At all  Not long  Decades  I mean  Just a couple  Decades  Right  Yeah  So we're  Growing up  They were all  Just considered  Weirdos  Weirdos  So this is  Someone that  That I  What was the  Most honest  Thing he said  To you  That you  Went  Oh man  Why are you  We had a  We had a  Guest of the  Show  A really  Heavy guest 
[02:23:00]  That I was  Really excited  To get on  And I did  An interview  With him  And it  Went  Really well  And I  Thought we  Killed  And we  Finished  And I  Said  How did  That seem  To you  And he  Said  Oh you  Shouldn't  Ask me  Right after  The show  Because it  Was awful  And I  Was sleeping  Almost there  But he  Said you  Have to  Learn  You can't  Just ask  Me  I don't  Know how  To do  That thing  Other people  Do  And avoid  It  So if  You don't  Want that  Kind of  Answer  You

[02:40:00]  The Opie and Anthony Show  God, you got a million stories  Penn Jillite in studio  One of my favorite guests  Absolutely  Read his book  I check out his podcast Sunday School  And actually I want to go back to your trip to China 
[02:40:30]  Yeah  You read about that  You wrote about that in your book  Yeah, I wrote a lot about it  You know, it was really crazy  We did this  It was Canadian crew  Had this idea of doing a show  Showing magic around the world  But not magic done for tourists  But magic done for people of that place  And so they sent us  We were like 200 clicks out of Beijing  And we were in Shattapur 
[02:41:00]  Which is the slum  To the slum of Delhi  We're outside of Calcutta  And we didn't see a lot of magic  Saw a lot of suffering  It was amazing  You know, in India  And, you know, Matt  Where in the hell is Matt?  The guy that dances around the world  That great, great cool guy  He said that, you know, India  You just, you can go  Now, when Americans go to India  They usually go to five-star hotels  And the Maharishi 
[02:41:30]  And they're doing all the incense burning and stuff  They don't go to the places in India  That are less good  And turns out  And for good and sufficient reasons  If you guys had a vote  It'd be the same here in the U.S.  Magicians are, in India  Used to be, part of the untouchable class  And I'm, you know, you're thinking  Yeah, it probably should be that way  Yeah, sure  We're fine  So they were living  So here we were  In our suits  Mic'd up  Covered with flies 
[02:42:00]  From head to toe  With open sewage  With leprosy  And polio  All the fuck around us  Trying to do kind of a comedy show  Did it smell bad?  You tell me  Open sewers?  What do you think?  Smell good, bad?  What do you think?  Of course it is funny  Oh, it was  Wow  It was sickening  Did you get depressed?  Yes  And I had, on top of that  I had left my mom 
[02:42:30]  Dying  Wow  In the U.S.  So I'm calling my mom  Every chance I get  And I'm going like  I'm in Calcutta  You know  And just saying  To someone on the phone  I'm in Calcutta  You go  What kind of weird turns  Is my life taking?  Yeah  And you know  We have this bit  I mean  One of the guys  Was talking to me about it  We have this bit  In our show  In Vegas  That we  I mean  We wrote it  You know  Right when we came back  From China 
[02:43:00]  We wrote it in 2000  And it's still in our show  You know  We change our show  All the time  But it just doesn't go away  It's our flag burning  Right  Where we talk about  The First Amendment  And how important the flag is  Right  And I remember saying  To G. Gordon Liddy  And also to  To Glenn Beck  I said  You know  When you come to our show live  We're going to burn a flag  On stage  And you're going to  Stand up and cheer  And they said  No way  I am against flag burning  I said  No you're going to  You're going to stand up and cheer  So Teller and I came back 
[02:43:30]  From those places  And just said  We have to write  The most patriotic bit  We could ever write  We have to write  About the USA  With the magic trick  Because freedom  Has really given us  Everything we have  You know  If we were magicians  We got to kind of see  And I realize this is  Overly melodramatic  But in that kind of  Pressure situation  Melodrama does come to your heart  We got to see  Magicians our age  Working in Beijing 
[02:44:00]  And working in Cairo  And working in Calcutta  And you really kind of go  Wow  Do I want to be in Vegas  You know  It's just  You described a magician  In China  It was deeply depressing  It was like  Kind of an open mall  Or something  And he was trying  To do his shit  Oh it was crazy  And no one was around  He was pretty much  Doing it for himself  When you get  Top down  Planning  You know  I mean that's  Anybody that loves  Government  And loves bureaucracy  And wants everything 
[02:44:30]  Planned out nice  Go to China  Then come back  And we'll talk about it  You know  They put together  This place called  Wuchow  Which as I said  Is a couple hundred clicks  Out of Beijing  Woo wuchow  Things are going to get easier  Wuchow  And at that time  Now the internet  Has changed everything  In the past  You know  12 years  Everything changes entirely  But the time  We were there  We were the first  White people  They had seen  You know  And I'm asking them  Through translators 
[02:45:00]  Beatles  Nothing  Elvis  Nothing  Madonna  Nothing  You know  And what they said  When they saw me  They kept saying  Michael Jordan  Michael Jordan  They thought I looked  Just like Michael Jordan  Because they had never seen  I mean it was really funny  The pictures of me in China  You think it's some sort of gag  Because it looks like  They've captured Bigfoot  You know  They're all normal sized people  And then you know  I'm six foot seven  I'm three hundred pounds  I'm gigantic in the U.S. 
[02:45:30]  Here  Now imagine where the average height  Is five two  And imagine this guy  Comes up  Gets out of a van  With a crew around him  And walks  Ah  Yeah  Children running and screaming  So they had decided  That they should have  A  A place to show magic  So in the middle of nowhere  They build this huge  Industrial place  That looks like a prison  Giant  And doesn't have  Central heating  Then they put backdrops up 
[02:46:00]  And then they hire  Have like  Twenty magicians  And there is  And  No hyperbole here  There is no one  There  As an audience  No one  And we're going to shoot  At the  At the magic  School  And at the magic performance  And there's no heat  It's the middle of the winter  Oh wow  They're wearing like spandex  They're huddled around  This little space heater  There's a backdrop  Of the New York skyline  And there's a boombox 
[02:46:30]  And we go in there  With our crew  And they put the boombox  You know  They play 42nd street  You know  And then they come out  And do like a silk  Routine  You're producing silks  Out of their hands  And then go huddle around  This little space heater  This sounds horrible  And the entire audience  I got depressed  Reading about this  The entire audience  Was the two of us  And now the weird thing  About China and the U.S.  And you can't  You know  You can see so much  About a culture 
[02:47:00]  In a microcosm  You know  We're just talking magic now  Right  Now if you  Are sitting with me  If we go out  Have supper  We're sitting around afterwards  And we get to talking  About magic  And you want to  I will claim  To you  Looking in your eyes  I'll say  Ant  We invented this  We invented that  That was our idea  If I could get away with it  Looking at your face  I will tell you  That I invented playing cards  And then Anthony  I got the idea  Of spades  Hearts  Diamonds  And clubs  That idea came to me 
[02:47:30]  And I was thinking  That's what the four suits  Would be  And if you go  Really  I go yeah  You keep going  And 52  Was such a good number  And I thought  There should be two jokers  And I thought  And then I decided  That I would come up with this  Have you ever seen  This card trick  Seven row  Seven cards  And three rows  That was mine  And as long as you're buying it  I'm going to go  Sure  Chinese magicians  This guy would come in  With an act  A move  That we had never  Ever seen 
[02:48:00]  Brand new  This guy invented it  Man  When did you go  With that move  And all through translators  Oh it's ancient  It goes back  You know  Ancient goes back  To our forefathers  You know  My teacher  And his teacher  And the teacher before him  It's always been done  Just like this  No it hasn't  That's your move  You came up with it  Every single thing  You try to compliment them on  The only way  They'll accept a compliment  Is by going  This is ancient  This goes way back  Oh wow  Right  This is exactly the same  And when we went to  Like magic schools 
[02:48:30]  People are like  Working on the cups and balls  They are trying to do  Exactly  What the person  Ahead of them did  If there's one little wrinkle  You know  Teller  Teller goes over  And goes  You know  If you do the move  Like this  It'll be a little more  This is the way we do it  That's it  So these guys  Who are huge innovators  Huge innovators  Who are just claiming  This stuff goes back  A thousand years  What was a move  You had never seen before  What was something  That actually impressed you  I'm talking about  Really really subtle stuff  You know  You're talking about minutia  Okay 
[02:49:00]  But when you're talking  About magic  You know  The way he's handling something  Right  And you know  We've seen  We've seen the videotapes  Of the people  That did come over here  Videotapes from the 60s  The way they did it  And we know  There's innovations  But it's so nutty  That in the U.S.  You know  Everything is about  The individual  And can I claim  To have invented this  How is this my idea  You know  If you talk to Justin Bieber  Rock and roll  Pretty much my idea  You know 
[02:49:30]  One direction  The idea  That close vocal harmonies  Kind of ours  There was stuff before us  But we kind of brought  A whole new thing  You know  The Beatles  The Beatles  There were no girl groups  Before them  That did those tight harmonies  You know  There was nobody  Wearing long hair  That's all us  We kind of all  The idea of using  Multi-track recording  To tell a whole story  On a record  Never mind  That Sinatra did it  In 1958  Yeah  Never mind  That Pet Sounds  Was already out 
[02:50:00]  Never mind  That Frank Zappan  Already did Freak Out  That was Paul's idea  You know  That's the way  Our culture functions  And it was so weird  To us  To say to people  Because you know  The first thing we ask  And the magic trick  Is you know  Who developed that  Where did it come from  You know  You want to give credit  Oh no  There's thousands of years  It's a whole society  Yeah  So when we came back  We wanted to just talk about  You know  Individualism  And you know  And there's a  There's a  Really good argument  You can live a very happy life 
[02:50:30]  With a collectivist point of view  It's just so foreign  To the way I was brought up  Right right  Yeah  I mean my mom and dad  Were you know  You do what is in your heart  And what you think is right  And you stay with that  I remember my mom  And as I said  She was you know  Really old  And she'd want to  Play bridge  She'd play  She'd play bridge  With Mrs. Cosby  Bill Cosby's mother  Yeah  Because Bill Cosby lived  Outside of Greenfield  And at the 
[02:51:00]  You know  At the retirement center  The old age center  Mrs. Cosby would go  And then my mom would go  And they'd play bridge together  And they were the two  Showbiz moms  Wow  So I would get phone calls  From my mom saying  You know  Mrs. Cosby and I  Were talking today  And she said  You should host  The Tonight Show  Because that worked out  Really well for her son  And she said  That when her son  Hosted The Tonight Show  It really did boost  His career a bit  So Mrs. Cosby and I  Were saying  That you should  You should host 
[02:51:30]  The Tonight Show  Well mom  I haven't been asked  I don't even know  That Bill was asked  She didn't say  That Bill was asked  She just showed up  Yeah  How great is that  You think  Mrs. Cosby was just  Throwing jabs  Like to say  That my kid's  Better than your kid  Like you want to  Have your son  Be racially innovative  And do a  TV show  That no one else  In his race can do  What  It was great  That New England stuff 
[02:52:00]  But you know  My mom  To talk to the other women  At the Senior Center  She would want to watch  These you know  The daytime shows  Which I don't know  If it was Oprah then  But whatever it was  In the late 90s  You know  And she'd say to me  She always said  The same thing  She always said  There was a show today  And it was a brother  And sister  Who were living together  As man and wife  And there were no children  And I just didn't know  Why it was anyone's business  And I go  Mom 
[02:52:30]  If you have that attitude  You cannot watch  The daytime show  And everything  Every single day  She'd go into  The Senior Center  And the woman  Would gossip  And she would say  I don't know why  That's anyone's business  Who cares  If they're not hurting anybody  They should be able  To do whatever they want  And you know  When I was friends  With Al Goldstein  You know  And Screw Magazine  I was watching  I was watching a news thing  After he was arrested  For pornography again  And my mother said  Do they  Do they give these magazines 
[02:53:00]  To people who don't want them  And I said  No  And she said  Then what's the problem  I would have made  A great mobster  Keep her mouth shut  Stay out of people's business  Keep her nose clean  Yeah  Maybe Mrs. Cosby  Can let us wear our beaks  But that was  You know  That was it  When we were traveling overseas  It really was a different  Point of view  Did you feel like  The people were suffering  Or it's just their way of life  And they're kind of used to it  They are 
[02:53:30]  Is it your perspective  You know what I'm trying to say  At the time  At the time  Yeah  It was certainly clear  I mean  We were over there  At the tail end  Of them  Having rather draconian laws  About how many children  You could have  So they were killing  Infant girls  Amazing  And you know  You had this hotel  Full of Americans  That were over there  Adopting Chinese girls  And it was just crazy to see  Because they had limited  And they all wanted boys  Right 
[02:54:00]  They were just throwing away  Chinese girls  And you'd see  Unbelievable  These little babies  Being pulled out of orphanages  And for the people  In the U.S.  Who were adopting  Chinese babies  Puts them in  I don't want to throw around  Words like rich  And that changes a lot  But they had to be able  To get a ticket to China  And back  They had to be able  To get away from work  For three weeks  They had to have a lawyer  To do the paperwork  You know  They've got to have  You know 
[02:54:30]  A couple hundred dollars  And I was thinking  About these  Children who were left  Pretty much  To suffer in an orphanage  And then all of a sudden  Bingo  They're living in Beverly Hills  You know  It's crazy how  That whole world  You know  You just  I would just sit  And cry  In the lobby  Because the lobby  You know  This is a five star  Fancy ass hotel  Where like  Bond should be staying  Right  And it's just  All strollers  And all huggies 
[02:55:00]  And all this baby equipment  Wow  And all  Parents to be  I mean  None of these people  Have children  They've brought  All this shit over  From the US  In order to  Adopt  The child  That they will  Spend their life with  And  Now that's all changed  I mean  I want to make it  Very clear  I was right at  The very end of that  And China's opened up  And  My friend Matt  The guy who does  You know  Where the hell is Matt  And dances around the world  Says that  Since 2000  To now  The whole world 
[02:55:30]  Has changed  The internet  Has leapfrogged  People  Yeah  And the education  Is just so phenomenal  So how do they  Handle it now in China  I don't know  Are they annoyed  That they were robbed  Of this information  For that long  Are you  No no  But I mean  It wasn't withheld  Like  I'll tell you  I am really bummed  That when I was in high school  We didn't have the web  And sexting  Can you imagine  Having sexting  How much easier it was  What you would have  On your phone  Yes  I mean  I would have  With the girlfriends  I had in high school 
[02:56:00]  I would have had  You know  An entire case book  Of the Supreme Court  Of pictures  I would have been  Sending so many  Pictures of my dick  To so many people  In high school  No I mean  I'm sorry  I mean stuff like  Are they mad  That the government  Withheld all this stuff  From them  Like almost like  The way they're now  Seeing the world  Has opened up  Not just the dirty  Individual stuff  But like in China  Like you said  They'd never seen  White people  And all of a sudden  Oh my god  There's one area  Yeah  It's just crazy  I don't know  If you perceive it  That way  I don't know  If you perceive it  That you've been 
[02:56:30]  Stopped  All these years  I mean  I wasn't really  Kidding about  Saying  How shocked  Are you  Because when  When the internet  First started  Flowing over us  I just couldn't  I mean  I used to have to  I'd read a reference  In a book  And have to get on my bike  And go to the library  Go through the fucking  Dewey Decimal System  Find the book  And look it up  And I just can't believe  That you can say  Oh who's Gene Vincent  And do a clip on that  And go  Oh the blue caps  And they were on it 
[02:57:00]  So who's  You know  Who's Carl Perkins  Boom  You can learn  You can get the song  Right on your phone  While you're walking  Down the street  You can think of a song  And if you have a connection  Just download it  And we haven't started yet  But there are kids out there  That don't know any better  We actually live  The complete opposite  You're right  My daughter  Said  We're in the car  We're driving  My daughter says  Play Yellow Submarine  And I kind of laugh at her  And go  Well you know  It's the radio honey  We just don't have  Every song here 
[02:57:30]  This is serious  We can't just  If Yellow Submarine  She goes  You have it on your phone  Plug it in  And play it  And I go  Oh yeah  Well actually  Actually honey  I don't have it on the phone  And she goes  Buy it  And I go  Oh yeah  Yes  We can't hear  Yellow Submarine right now  Just like that  And it's still  I still can't believe  That I can be driving  In my car  And want to hear  You know  That band Magma  From the 70s  Who performed everything  In their own language  I'd like to hear 
[02:58:00]  Side two  Of that double record set  Everything is available  To see  Or listen to  Or read  You don't have to  Wonder anymore  And sit there  Call your friends  And go  Who was that guy  In that movie  That used to  Boggle you  For hours on end  And then  Your brother would be like  Oh it was that guy  And it was like  You finally go  Oh thank god  Now you just go to IMDB  And that's it  There you go  All right  Oh  It took 15 seconds 
[02:58:30]  Yeah  And I didn't have to buy it  Exactly  All right  Go to YouTube  That is pretty fucked up  It's just incredible  We just take it for granted  And we haven't  We do come from a time  We couldn't do any of this shit  You know I was in  I went to visit Google  And what's his name  Serge  Yeah  One of the founders  I'm in his office  Right  And he says to me  He says to me  Talk to me about  A perfect shuffle  A faro shuffle  And I said 
[02:59:00]  He said  I've been reading about this  And I said  Well you know  It's a  It's a  If you take a deck of cards  And you shuffle it perfectly  Every card interlaces  With every other card  And you do that 52 times  The cards are in the same order  They started out  Now  If instead of doing it  If instead of doing the  The outer cards mixing  If you do it so the inner cards mix  After eight times  The cards are in the exact order you want  Whoa  So  If you can do a perfect shuffle  You can 
[02:59:30]  Lay out the cards  Just the way you want them  Right  You can then shuffle them  Four times perfectly  You can then bring the cards  Out of your pocket  I can say  I'm going to do a card trick for you  I do four shuffles  Right in your face  That are just perfect  And then the cards are in the exact order  I want them in  Perfect shuffle  It's a rather hard move to do  Oh I don't care  A rather hard move  I thought you  I thought you were talking  It's a theory  That's actually been done?  By me  Oh my god 
[03:00:00]  And it's called the Pharaoh Shuffle  So Serge says to me  You know I really want to know  All about the Pharaoh Shuffle  And I want to learn how to do it  And he said  Can you teach me?  I said sure  Open up Google  Type in Pharaoh Shuffle  The first thing that pops up  Will be Mike Close  With a video teaching you to do a Pharaoh Shuffle  And I said  Follow what he says in the video  And you'll be able to do it  I said  You schmuck 
[03:00:30]  You've invented Google  Google it  You cannot ever talk to anyone  About anything that's factual  All you can talk to us about  From now on  Is opinions  There's nothing else you can say  And he types in Pharaoh Shuffle  Into Google  And sure enough  Mike Close pops up  And there's a Pharaoh  It's an incredibly satisfying magic move  Yeah  Wow  But of course  If in those eight shuffles  You make one mistake  Oh you fuck up  Then as you said  Last appearance 
[03:01:00]  You've got to go on  To a different trick  Well you know  You've made the mistake  Can you tell  While you're doing that  Is there a way to tell  Or you  It can be so close sometimes  You know right away  Oh you do  You can hear it  I hear people talking about  Baseball players  That the guys  In outfield  I don't know why  I'm talking about  Using analogies  Something I know nothing about  But I've heard sports guys  Talk about the sound of it  And they know exactly  Where it's going to be  When someone's doing  A perfect Pharaoh  I can hear it  Without looking at it  Wow  And if they make a mistake  You can hear 
[03:01:30]  It falls wrong  You just go  It's like when people do a  I had this friend  Oh god I loved him  His name was Jerry Camaro  And Jerry  Great name  He's Dendo  He rode  He rode with the Huns  He was a motorcycle guy  With the Huns  The Connecticut motorcycle gang  Crazy motherfuckers  Crazy crazy crazy  And he was shot four times  Stabbed five times  He's the one that got the idea  Of stealing arms  From the Black Panthers  And selling them back to them 
[03:02:00]  That was his idea  Good thinking  So he was in the hospital  He did time  In jail for a long time  And then he asked  To get out of the gang  Which you can't do  But he'd done so much service  For them  He asked to get out  They let him out  And he became a close up magician  And we got to know each other  Really really  Yeah really good friends  And I loved him  And he would do  Second deals  And bottom deals  You know  You take a deck of cards  He could deal them  Just like this  And the top card  Stays in place 
[03:02:30]  Oh wow  He's coming off the bottom  Or off  So you put whatever you want  On the top  You get your ace on the top  You deal as long as you want  Whatever you want that ace to fall  It does  Or you put whatever card you want  On the bottom  It's there  And the thing that kills you  On  Doing seconds  Is that people hear it  And if you don't know  What you're listening for  The  Is not quite perfect  And people hesitate  For a moment  And you hear that  And go  Something's wrong  And they look at you 
[03:03:00]  His were perfect  You get down  Right at his fingers  And like look  Perfect  Does that mean he's dealing  From the bottom of the deck  Dealing from the bottom of the deck  And you can't tell  You cannot tell  Can you do that  Cannot see it  Cannot hear it  No  That's the point of the story  The point of the story is  What he's doing is  Impossible  Impossible  Oh my god  So one of the things  Magicians do to make money  Because making money in magic  Is a tough gig  Is they'll do lectures  Which means they go around  To different little chapters 
[03:03:30]  Of magicians  You go out to Brooklyn  There's 30 guys  Get together in a church basement  And they pay you  A couple hundred bucks  You do your lecture  You sell your lecture notes  And then you go to  Fridays with them  They buy you dinner  And then you sleep  On some guy's couch  And you tour around the country  That's where you make  Your living doing lectures  So Jerry  Is going around  Doing lectures  On his second deal  And his bottom deal  Going you know  And he's got a little pamphlet  That he's selling  You know for $15  Jerry Camaro's  Perfect second deal 
[03:04:00]  Perfect bottom deal  That he's teaching these guys  And he's doing it for them  He demos it  Explains it  Demos it  Explains it  Guys come with their video cameras  Demos it  Explains it  And I go  Jerry  Did you tell them  In every one of the lectures  At the end  You say  Oh and by the way  You have to do 14 years  For murder one  Or you have no chance  Of learning this  Your chances are zero  You need to practice  Seven days a week  Four hours a day  For 14 years  There's one way to do that 
[03:04:30]  Kill a motherfucker  Kill a motherfucker  And then you will  Perfect  My favorite  Jerry Camaro story  Was Jerry was working  At a place called  Magic Island  In Southern California  Kind of  One of those phony  Classy places  You know  Prime rib  All you can eat  But you know  Flocked wallpaper  And Jerry's wearing  A tuxedo  And Jerry's a guy  Not too tall  Shaved head 
[03:05:00]  Big beard  Burly  You know  And he's going around  Doing his magic act  And I'm watching him  And I'm standing in the back  There's about  Eight guys he's working for  All yuppies  You know  This is the  This is the 90s  Rich fuckers  You know  Taking their second wives  To you know  Magic Island  To see some guy work  He's obviously  The bottom of the totem pole  These guys are the shit  And he's working for them  He's just putting in his time  And I'm there  Visiting him  Hanging out with him 
[03:05:30]  I'm standing in the back  Watching him work  Doing great card tricks  You know  His patter's like this  Really  Just straight  Just jokes  101  With these incredible moves  Right  And he's got this asshole  In the audience  This asshole  Is heckling him  Yeah bullshit  Let me shovel the neck  Doing all that shit  They do  Just  Just a fucking asshole  Right  So Jerry says  I'll show you one  Just for you  He puts the neck down  And rolls up his sleeves 
[03:06:00]  Pulls out the cards  Does this  Four ace assembly  Which means  Four aces come together  Where you don't expect them  Under his hands  Amazing move  Guy shuts up  He goes on with his show  We go backstage  A little bit  He says  You know  I'm glad you got to see that  I had that asshole  Yuppie  That stockbroker  Piece of shit  He said  And he was giving me  A hard time  And then I did  Just a four ace assembly  And that just  Shut him right up  It shut him right up 
[03:06:30]  And I go  Jerry  It wasn't the trick  He goes  That's a great  Fucking trick  What are you talking about  Man  There's my perfect  Second in there  That's a great  Fucking trick  I go  Wasn't the trick  Jerry  He goes  What'd I do wrong  On the trick  What  You had a bad angle  I go  No the trick  Was perfect  Jerry  That's not what  Shut him up  He said  What shut him up  I said  Rolling up your sleeves  He goes  What do you mean  I go  You roll up your sleeves  And it's covered  With jailhouse tats  It says  Fuck the world 
[03:07:00]  And that says  1% citizen  99% criminal  And you  And you  Have  You have  Dennis the menace  On a trike  Flipping the finger  And it says  Fuck the world  Under it  In big letters  And it's all done  With India ink  And a needle  It does not look  Like mall ink  This is  This is jailhouse ink  And you say  To the guy  Oh  You're giving me  A hard time  Let me show you  Something  And you roll up  Your sleeves  Never saw the trick 
[03:07:30]  And the guy  Is not seeing  Anything with the aces  He's just going  Guys got  Fuck the world  He tattooed  On his forearm  And I was just  Heckling him  If I keep  Heckling him  That entire deck  Of cards  Is going up my ass  Followed by his cock  And I'm guessing  It's big  Yes sir  No sir  From now on  He went  Well a lot of people  Have tattoos  I go  Not like that  They don't say  Fuck the world  And it was this  Beautiful image 
[03:08:00]  Because he's wearing  A tuxedo  So he's like  Undoing the cuff link  And rolling up  To show this  Fucking nightmare  A nightmare  That assholes  Can tell  From what  50 yards away  Right  Assholes can tell  Jailhouse ink  If you're the kind  Of guy  Who goes to a bar  And hassles people  You have a sense  Of jailhouse ink  You better  Yeah  So why wouldn't  You get jailhouse ink  For a tattoo  Instead of going  To the stupid mall  Right  Exactly 
[03:08:30]  That would be  A good business  I think  Yeah  Jailhouse ink  Get a guy  Used to do it  In the joint  Open up a little shop  Yeah  It would make you  Look like you were  In the joint  It was  You know  Jailhouse ink  It's amazing  How everything  Changes everything  There was an article  Written  A nutty article  Just to show you  The kind of shit  That I'll occasionally  Read  About how  Jailhouse ink  Changed  Because of  Cassette players  When walkmen  Hit cassette players  Guys in jail  Learned how to  Use the motor 
[03:09:00]  Of a walkman  To move a needle  In and out  So jailhouse ink  Changed the tribal  Patterns  As soon as  Walkmen  Got into prisons  So that's how  Technology changes  Our world  The kind of tattoos  You had  Now the kind  Jerry had  Were pre-walkman  So they were  Just some guy  Paid in cigarettes  And sexual favors  Sitting there  With a needle  With thread tied  Around it  So it wouldn't  Go in too deep 
[03:09:30]  Dipping  Into india ink  You know  Squeezed out of  Flare pens  Broken flare pens  And putting each  Dot in  One by one  Just so  The guy  That he's  Serving  Can say  Fuck the world  On his forearm  Forever  But that's the  Kind of guy  Jerry Camaro  Was  The other story  I loved about  Jerry  Was Jerry  Jerry and I  Were very close  And I loved  Him  But we did  Not understand  Each other  He'd done 
[03:10:00]  14 years  In prison  I myself  Have not  That makes a  Difference  Kind of hard to  Wrap your mind  Around  So Jerry  Jerry's on  On a train  Going to  Another one  Of these  Gigs  And he  Hadn't  Seen me  In a  Couple  Years  And he's  Walking through  The bar  Car  Jerry  Didn't drink  But he's  Going to  Get a  Sandwich  And he  Sees a  Guy  Big guy  Ponytail  Talking to  The bar  And he  Goes oh  Man  That's  Pan  That's  Pan  That's  Really  Exciting  It's  Pan  It's  Pan  And he

[03:47:00]  Pepper  Hicks  From 
[03:47:30]  His dick sucked, all right?  Before this shit goes.  Get a blow.  Get a blow before it blows.  All right, Roland.  Well, thank you for the call.  At least I had one awesome buffet for lunch.  I was very, very happy.  Awesome buffet for lunch.  Roland.  All he cares about is food.  Dallas has a brand new one.  Who cares?  It's a buffet.  Order some pussy.  He'd rather food than pussy.  Yeah.  How about a titty buffet, right?  Who kid?  Yo, nipples for breakfast, man.  What are you doing talking to us right now?  Yeah, squeeze something out of my cereal, yo.  A baby sucking his tit, man. 
[03:48:00]  Come on.  That's the freakiest shit you did before you went to Vegas, man.  All right.  Thanks, Roland.  All right, my moistures.  All right.  It's an indirect child molester, man.  I'll talk to you later, buddy.  My stomach is hurting from that.  Joe DeRosa is on the phone.  What's up, Joe?  Oh, shit.  Hi, Sam.  How are you?  Did you hear what we were just talking to Roland about?  Was it about how he tried to light me on fire?  No, that was yesterday.  He tried to light him on fire?  Well, Roland, like, Troy and Joe DeRosa, because Troy, he started coming on the show and kind 
[03:48:30]  of shit-talking Joe DeRosa out of nowhere.  And so the Caroline's party was on Monday.  Yeah.  And, you know, Caroline's Comedy Club.  And Joe was like, I've kind of had enough of Troy's shit, and I'm going to talk to him  because if he's got a problem, we're going to talk face-to-face.  Yeah, Troy's a little bit of a shit-talker.  He is.  And so Joe approached Troy, and he's like, dude, do we have a problem?  Let's talk.  And they started having a serious talk. 
[03:49:00]  Roland was intoxicated and started waving a teacup candle under Joe DeRosa's shirt tail.  Well, he thinks it's funny now.  Yeah.  I fucking, I wish I would have went up in flames and died just so he would have had to deal  with it.  Yeah.  Like, it would have been worth burning to death, to Roland, to have to deal with the  repercussions of his prank.  Just to learn a lesson.  And it would really make me happy.  So what's going on, dude?  Nothing.  I literally just, I just listened to the show, the show that happened the day after the Caroline's 
[03:49:30]  party.  And I, so I, first of all, I didn't know that Roland was waving a candle on me.  So I heard that, and I was like, I was laughing, and I was like, oh, I want to, I want to  call her and talk about that.  But I was also, you know, I get real into the Christmas spirit, Sam.  I get real into it every year.  Yeah.  I was so touched hearing Troy tell back the story about how we made up and how we hugged.  Oh. 
[03:50:00]  And I actually got a warm feeling from it.  Like, I'm really happy that we talked about it, and then everything's cool, and when we  both got our, we both got stuff off our chest, and it was good, man.  Yeah.  So warm.  It was really, really positive.  This is nice.  It's the Christmas spirit, Joe.  And that's what, I know, like, the Opie and Anthony show, they're all like, oh, negative,  negative.  But on the after show, we try to make the Christmas spirit last all year long.  And you know that about me personally, Joe.  It's so warm in here.  I know that about you, Sam.  That's why, you know, usually when I do a radio show, I plug things like a web series 
[03:50:30]  or a CD, and today I'm plugging Love and Hope.  Oh.  This is wonderful, Joe.  You know what we just found out, though?  It's funny that you just called in, because we were just talking about Troy, and he was  hyping up.  You leaving, Nicole?  I'm sorry.  I have to.  My husband's in the hospital getting surgery.  Oh, by the way, Joe, wait till you hear this.  Nicole tweets out.  What?  That her husband is in for surgery.  Pray for him.  Yeah.  It's knee surgery. 
[03:51:00]  Why would you pray for somebody who's having knee surgery?  Because you know what?  Anytime you go under anesthesia, you might not come out, okay?  I was circumcised when I was 19, and I was under anesthesia.  And you know what?  Nobody prayed for me.  I would have prayed for you if I knew you.  It's a waste of a prayer.  Obviously, I'm going to be fine.  You got some good insurance policy?  Yeah.  Call your insurance company real quick.  Okay.  They'll pray for you.  Anyway, Joe.  I would just say, I'm praying for you.  Mary, Mary, uh, Hanukkah, Nicole.  Mary Hanukkah.  Yeah, just a minute ago, Troy and Roland are out in Vegas right now. 
[03:51:30]  Uh-huh.  And Troy had been hyping up what, like, a big party night last night was going to be,  and they were going to be hanging out, and they were just going to be...  They didn't do shit.  Roland was in bed by 1.30 in the morning.  Really?  Yeah.  It was really disappointing.  Fucking loser.  They didn't sleep on the plane, and they were tired, and Troy's girlfriend was kind  of not feeling well, and they just went to bed.  Oh, man.  That's a bummer.  That's a real bummer.  How many nights are they out there for?  Roland said he's going back to his folks' house, like, tonight, today. 
[03:52:00]  What a loser.  What?  I don't know.  Like, that was it.  That was Vegas.  They ain't even ordering no prostitutes.  What are they doing?  They ain't even ordering prostitutes.  Yeah.  Who Kid's in here, too, by the way.  Yeah.  They ain't ordering no whores.  I can't hear who you said.  Who's in this?  Who's in there?  DJ Who Kid.  Yeah, I'm in here right now.  Oh, Who Kid.  What's up, man?  How are you?  Yeah, what's up, man?  I'm just angry they didn't order any prostitutes.  That's all I got to say.  I'm excited to be on the phone with you.  We met one time on the show.  Oh, for real?  I'm a big fan of yours.  Yeah, you remember.  Joe was, you guys were actually talking a little bit old school hip-hop, and you said 
[03:52:30]  that Joe should come on your show.  Yeah.  He had glasses.  Yeah.  You know what, Who Kid?  I really would love to come on sometime.  Let's do it, man.  Yeah, I love hip-hop.  I just watched The Art of Rap.  Have you guys seen that movie?  I like that shit with Eminem rapping, and he did the whole...  That's not Ice-T's movie, is it?  ...Nority by Nature.  Yeah.  Is that Ice-T's movie?  Coco was rapping on that, too.  Yeah, it was really incredible.  It was like...  My favorite part was watching...  Yeah, so it's all about the art of rap, hence the title. 
[03:53:00]  But my favorite part was watching all the different rappers.  They'd be like, well, who are your favorites?  And they would rattle off three or four guys.  And then they would rattle off lyrics from three or four guys.  And I was like, it's amazing to me how rappers remember other guys' lyrics, like the  way comics remember bits.  Yeah, totally.  Like, I could rattle off bits all day, but I could never remember, like, hip-hop lyrics  like that, because it's not like my job, you know?  You know who Krispy Kreme is?  Krispy Kreme the donut? 
[03:53:30]  No, no, no.  There's your rapper.  Krispy Kreme.  I knew who you were saying it, yeah.  Who kid, do you know the rapper Krispy Kreme?  Yeah, I know who you did.  All right, can you look him up on YouTube?  I want to play a little bit for Joe DeRosa.  Krispy Kreme is the fucking shit.  I talked about him on my Sunday show.  I talked about him on my podcast.  He is the future of rap.  Who kid, are you playing him on Shade 45?  Uh, no.  I got 400 cars.  See?  Even the hipsters like him.  Joe, you've never heard of the rapper Krispy Kreme?  He's hot right here.  I never, I really haven't.  I said I really a rapper named Krispy Kreme. 
[03:54:00]  Yeah, he's a YouTube rapper.  He got like 4 million views.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've kissed every girl in the world.  Okay, listen.  Hey, everybody, it's Krispy Kreme, and I'm back on another track.  This one's for the club.  Yeah, yeah.  Get up, be serious.  I've been shot about 500 times, and I've done about 1 million crimes.  I killed a great white shark.  I knocked out his teeth, and I ripped out his heart.  Talk crap, and I'll give you a scar. 
[03:54:30]  Talk crap, I'll throw eggs at your car.  I'll cut holes in your tires.  I'll put poop on your porch, and I'll light it on fire.  See?  No, this guy's the truth, Joe.  Classic right here.  I think he's kind of good, man.  He is good, and he's done a million crimes.  He's like a gangster.  He's beyond black.  I like that he did that.  I like that he doubled the crimes to how many times he was shot.  He's like beyond black, this guy.  Exactly.  In another one of his songs, he says Beyonce thinks he's cute, 
[03:55:00]  but that's okay because he thinks Beyonce's cute, too.  Oh, that's hot.  And wait until you hear this, Joe and who, kid?  Because you guys both appreciate a good rhyme scheme.  Krispy Kreme once said, Jay-Z, compared to me, he's lazy.  Oh, my God.  You know what I mean?  That's creative, my nigga.  You like that?  That's some real creative shit.  All right, Joe.  What are you doing for Christmas, Joe?  I'm going home to Pennsylvania.  I do a lot of partying. 
[03:55:30]  I actually couldn't go to a Christmas party last night  because of the amount of drinking I'm about to do.  You had to save yourself.  Yeah, I literally was like, I'm going to be drinking so much this weekend  into the week.  Like, it's literally the day before Christmas Eve,  Christmas Eve, and Christmas night,  it's three days of nonstop drinking with friends and family.  Ooh, by the correct, kid.  It's awesome.  It's the best.  I don't understand why people don't get excited about Christmas  when people are like, well, it's okay, and, you know, who cares? 
[03:56:00]  It's like, who cares?  It's like, license to act like a drunk douche.  I love it.  Four fucking days.  Like, nobody cares.  Nobody's judging you.  You could be a fall-down drunk.  Yeah, but you've got to, like, you've got to figure out when the cutoff is  because you're, like, acting like an asshole, and you're like,  it's Christmas.  They're like, it's the 29th of December, dude.  I mean, I don't...  That's what I do at my birthday every year.  I celebrate my birthday like one of the girls from Sex and the City.  I do, like, two nights.  Like, you throw your own parties. 
[03:56:30]  And they're great fucking parties.  You've got to come, man.  Don't be ever...  Like, the people that come are like, wow, this is a lot of fun.  Don't come or skeptical.  And I get why you're skeptical.  I respect it.  Like, I understand why you'd be like, I don't know, dude,  what am I really missing here?  I'm telling you, dude.  Pack these bars out, and it is a shit show.  You know why...  It's a shit show of drunks.  That's all it is.  It's fun. 
[03:57:00]  You know why I've never thrown a birthday party for myself?  What?  It's a fear of rejection.  Like, I don't want to have to go up to somebody and be like,  hey, do you want to come to my birthday party?  And look at them in the faces.  They go, no, dude.  Sam, it's a gamble, Sam.  It's a dice roll.  But here's the beautiful thing.  No!  They all, when they show up, it's a dice, right?  Don't show up.  And you packed up the bar.  You're like, this is my party, man. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah.  It's a really good feeling.  It's worth the risk, Sam.  It's worth the risk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  White people don't buy gifts for each other.  You guys are so happy.  I'm mad.  I got to waste money.  No, Hukid, you don't buy gifts for anyone.  You steal gifts for people.  It's all a different thing.  So I've done it.  You shoplift for people.  There's a dildo in that box.  Well...  Hukid, what do you do for your birthday, Hukid?  I had a birthday party in Dubai.  I don't know.  Do you guys do that?  Jesus Christ.  No, I don't go to Dubai.  No, yeah.  Royal families don't hire me to go to Dubai, Hukid.  Sorry.  They're daughters, too. 
[03:58:00]  Allah.  We're running out of time, Joe, but are you...  So are you not in town at all next week?  No, I'm going to be gone until like December 30th, but I'd love to come by in the new year.  Well, I was going to say, I'm hosting the morning show on Raw Dog next week, Wednesday,  Thursday, Friday.  If you had been in town, I would have had you on.  Well, listen, if by chance, I end up coming back.  I might come back a couple days earlier.  I'm not sure.  But if I come back, if you have room for me, I'll come in. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, let me know.  Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.  If you're in town, just let me know.  If I am, I will.  And Merry Christmas to all.  And you guys take care.  I'll talk to you soon.  All right.  Talk to you later, buddy.  Man, may I add, you're coming on my show on my New Year's Eve special, too.  Yeah.  Who am I talking to?  The chick from the Cookie Channel, right?  Who?  Yeah, I forgot.  I'll come back on the show with everybody.  We'll tweet about it or something.  See, look at the feeling of togetherness. 
[03:59:00]  I know.  Joe DeRosa.  I was mad at Joe DeRosa for a period of time, too.  Over on?  I wouldn't have him.  I banned him from the after show.  Nah, get out of here.  Because I felt like he wasn't respecting me.  He sounds so, like, nice and warm.  But you know what?  It's all good now.  And delicate.  In 2012, I've squashed beefs, as you would say, who kid?  I know.  With Joe DeRosa and with Guy Fieri.  I've also started beefs with both those people in 2012.  But I squashed them.  Y'all make up like that, man.  Y'all tongue each other and just come back on the radio?  No tonguing, man.  Well, kiss and make up, that's what we say in our world. 
[03:59:30]  Tongue.  Oh.  That's like a hip-hop thing?  Come on, man.  You're bonically trained.  Now you don't know the word tongue, man.  Cool.  Okay.  So I tongue all my guy friends.  Yeah, all right.  Tongue him, man.  Cool.  I'll mark that.  All right.  Listen, so you remember, I'll be on Raw Dog New Year's Eve, but I'll tweet about that.  Twitter at NotSam and NotSam.com.  I'll post everything I'm doing over the week.  But the big thing is that I'm live on Sunday on this channel, 4 p.m. Eastern, and the Raw  Dog Show, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday of next week, I'm hosting the morning show live.  And who kid? 
[04:00:00]  This is the big one.  Today.  Today.  I haven't plugged this yet.  Michael Cole and JBL from WWE.  You've met JBL before.  Yeah, I've met JBL.  Michael Cole and JBL, they do a web show called the JBL and Cole Show.  It's on YouTube, and it's on WWE.com.  You're on there.  Today.  Before 6?  Before 6.  It's going to be posted by noon, probably.  I'll tweet the link and everything, too.  But today, I will be on Michael Cole and JBL's web show. 
[04:00:30]  It's taped and everything.  It's not a live thing.  But I sent them a video that they're going to put on of me.  Gangster, son.  So I'll be on with Michael Cole and JBL.  Gangster.  Later today.  That's on WWE.com and on YouTube.  Make sure you're checking up on, you know, not saying everything, and I'll explain to  you where I'm going to be this week, so tune in for that.  But definitely watch the JBL and Michael Cole Show.  Come through Saturday, man.  I got a whole crew up here.  Saturday?  Fuck it.  I got Wiz Khalifa.  Wiz. 
[04:01:00]  Swizz B.  Last time he was up here, man.  Snoop Dog.  I got high just being on the floor with him.  For real?  He reeked of weed.  And it's 8 o'clock in the morning.  If you want to die, I have Snoop Dogg and Wiz the Gun.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait to hear that.  It's going to be a rap homo going down.  They're going to be tonguing.  Yeah, for Christmas.  Ebonics.  That's going to be Shade 45.  Listen, I've enjoyed the after show this year.  We'll be back with more in 2013.  I did lose 20% of my shows in 2012, but the shows have been really good on Monday, Tuesday, 
[04:01:30]  Thursday, Friday.  That's cool, though, right?  You only lost on Wednesday, right?  You're still the nigga, man.  Thank you.  That's what I need to hear.  I wish the guys down the hall would tell me that every now and then.  I'm good with everybody's sake, man.  Yeah.  Shoot bladder this year.  We'll see you next year.  Bye.  And later today and then all next week, too.  Goodbye, everybody.  My feet was in my ass through the whole call. </pre>
