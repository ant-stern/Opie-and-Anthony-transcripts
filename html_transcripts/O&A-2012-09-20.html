<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristically crude introductions and immediate descent into vulgar banter.  They then showcased a video of a man performing a repeated, increasingly intense pantomime of fellatio behind home plate at a Cubs-Pirates game, culminating in his removal by security.  The hosts found the video hilarious and planned to share it on their Facebook page. The conversation segued into the Pittsburgh Pirates' long losing streak and Penny Marshall's cancelled interview with the show.  They briefly touched upon a positive experience with guest Damien Echols, who later tweeted about his unease with the "creepy" Chelsea Hotel.  This led to a discussion of bed bugs, hotel cleanliness, and personal anecdotes involving cleaning ladies and observing women's "hiney cracks," with Jim Norton mentioning filming a segment for Joe DeRozan.  A caller, Angelo, provided an update on the Chelsea Hotel's renovation, and another compared Jim Norton to a character from *The Hunger Games*. The focus then shifted to a notoriously terrible New York hotel, initially misidentified as the New York Inn but later corrected to the Hotel Carter. The bulk of this segment was devoted to a YouTube video detailing the Hotel Carter's squalid conditions: infestations, violence, crime, and unsanitary conditions, including a woman's account of bloodstains, piss stains, and a missing bag from her room.  The hosts reacted with amusement and disgust, discussing the possibility of booking a room there. A caller recounted a negative experience from a school trip, mentioning a subsequent 60 Minutes exposé. The segment concluded with mentions of an upcoming guest, Tony Siragusa, and continued discussion of the Hotel Carter.

The next segment began with a discussion of a potentially problematic guest appearance, followed by a discussion of comedian Jesse Joyce, whose video they unsuccessfully attempted to play due to its length. This led to a discussion of Jim Croce's death in a plane crash, detailing the pilot's severe coronary artery disease and pre-crash three-mile run to the airport. The hosts lamented the lost songs and humorously discussed the accident details.  They then played and mocked several Big Bopper songs, criticizing his talent and stage presence.  They played and negatively reacted to Randy Newman's "I'm Dreaming of a White President," expressing their dislike for the song and its creator.  The show then promoted Jim Florentine's fantasy football show on Sirius XM.  Finally, Tony Siragusa joined the show in studio. Their conversation covered Siragusa's fanbase, Sirius XM's diverse programming ("The Radio Flea Market"), Art Modell's funeral, Siragusa's NFL career, including anecdotes about Art Modell chartering a helicopter for him and receiving an enema before a game.  They also discussed participation trophies and a childhood fight with Boomer Esiason.

The interview with Tony Siragusa continued, featuring a humorous anecdote about nearly defecating on the field, his radio career in Indianapolis, and pranks on his general manager. He also discussed the physical toll of his NFL career, including his retirement at 34 after multiple knee surgeries, Junior Seau's suicide, and ongoing concussion lawsuits.  He described a hit that temporarily paralyzed him and his subsequent return to the game, promoting his book, "Goose: The Outrageous Life and Times of a Football Guy."  Following the interview, Opie and Anthony played their "FU Line" segments, featuring vulgar listener messages. They discussed their post-interview experiences with Siragusa, including a photobomb and their "homeless shopping spree" stunt. They considered another event, possibly at Costco.  Comedian Jesse Joyce then joined the studio, discussing his upcoming performance, roast writing (including for Joan Rivers and Donald Trump), and encounters with various celebrities. The conversation touched on writing jokes for Larry King, working with Donald Trump, other comedians (including Mike Tyson), prison rape (a reference to a previous interview with Damien Echols), and the Joan Rivers documentary.

A later segment covered stand-up comedians Colin Quinn and Tom Papa, the hosts' comedy experiences, and a news story about a man arrested for having sex with a donkey.  They discussed a joke by Jesse Joyce from Joan Rivers' roast that caused Melissa Rivers to leave, and Julian, the man from the baseball game blowjob pantomime, called in to discuss the incident. The segment ended with the hosts playing (and criticizing) a Laurie Anderson song and discussing Lady Gaga's weight gain. Jesse Joyce remained a guest in the studio throughout this segment.

The next segment began with discussion of previous segments and breaks, with Jesse Joyce promoting his shows.  They discussed the West Memphis Three case and Peter Jackson's involvement, followed by sexually graphic and misogynistic comments about Lindsay Lohan.  They promoted upcoming appearances and Louis C.K.'s success.  The latter half focused on listener call-ins for a contest to name a new intern.  Numerous vulgar and offensive suggestions were offered, eventually settling on "Jawa." A caller won a signed Tony Siragusa book but hung up early, and Larry received it instead after Sam Roberts praised his commentary.  They also gave away the ex-girlfriend's deceased mother's vase and a potentially fake Paul McCartney-signed guitar.

The final segment centered on a guest named Troy, recounting a double penetration experience with a stripper, resulting in his penis wilting due to accidental testicular contact.  Guests Jessie May Peluso and Nicole joined the conversation. Peluso shared an anecdote about receiving a dental dam and a sexually explicit job application. The discussion continued with sexual innuendo and comparisons of sexual acts, with Nicole expressing surprise and disgust at Troy's stories.  The conversation touched on Troy’s past band experiences and the women he encountered. The segment concluded with the hosts promoting their social media and upcoming show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Welcome to the R.B. and Anthony show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So. 
[00:00:30]  Flash it.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know what to start.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed, and conventions burn to the ground. 
[00:01:00]  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie the destroyer.  Just pay us, you assholes!  I will continue.  Anthony the rage.  Shut the fuck up.  Come to my pool and drown in it.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning, everyone.  Yellow.  We've been laughing for the last five minutes.  I heard about this video. 
[00:02:00]  That's a funny one.  And we're seeing it for the first time here on the Opie and Anthony show, starring Jim Norton.  Uh, the dude behind home plate, pantomiming, uh, blowjobs.  Blowjobs.  Ever at the, uh...  It's one of the greatest videos ever made.  I'll tell you right now.  Yeah, where was it?  Wrigley?  Wrigley Field.  He's, uh...  Cubs-Pirates game.  Hilarious.  I guess, uh, the seats were pretty empty.  Uh, ninth inning.  He went down right behind home plate, right at the first seat. 
[00:02:30]  You know, that's, that's a great seat.  Sure is.  You always see the people there, they're talking on their cell phones, or sometimes they wave.  You know, shit like that.  Well, this guy decided to do that old, pump your hand in front of your mouth, put your  tongue in your cheek, like, like a cockhead poking the inside of your cheek.  Which all of us have done at least once in our lifetime.  And you make the blowjob move like that.  But he just got carried away.  Like, each time he did it, each, each batter that came up, he got more and more crazy with it. 
[00:03:00]  He was doing double fist pumping, and like, really doing, like, tug, tug, tug fast, so  it looked like a bunch of cum would be all over his face.  Very creative.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then security.  Which makes you wonder.  Yeah, why would he pick that?  No, it makes you wonder, you know, how does he know how to do that so well?  Oh, well.  But, uh, security finally came down.  Can we play the video game again?  I know it's visual, but it's fucking hilarious.  How's the, uh, the visual element, uh, going for the show? 
[00:03:30]  Good.  Good?  Yeah.  We'll put it up on Facebook, and everyone can look at it.  There you go.  Oh, all right.  All right.  That's good.  That's good.  Bumgarner got his feet.  Well, the announcers don't say anything about it.  They stink.  So, so far, the guy hasn't done anything.  Now he's two-fisting it.  Now he's two-fisting.  He's two-fisting.  And he's moving his head back and forth.  Back and forth.  Like he's, uh, pleasuring two penises.  In this game.  Next pitch, what does he do?  Half of them.  Now he's getting a little faster. 
[00:04:00]  He's really getting fast.  Oh, fuck.  Who's looking at him?  That guy up there.  He's fucking laughing.  He's doing it really fast.  Now he's doing the single hand.  Nice and slow.  He opens his mouth real wide.  That guy's looking at him.  That guy's just fucking laughing.  Doesn't matter anymore.  He's, uh, holy fuck.  And here comes the security guys.  And they're like, look, you can't be doing this. 
[00:04:30]  And one guy's on the phone looking up and you can tell the director.  Yeah, I got that guy.  That guy right there.  And he points at him.  Right.  Yeah.  And that was it.  Oh, that guy's a fucking classic.  You know, he's a hero to his friends.  He's a hero to everyone.  Me too.  You see fucking Wrigley Field blowjob home plate guy?  Yeah.  I know him.  He's my fucking buddy.  Nice.  He's my pal.  I think he's a hero to every man.  Oh, of course he is.  Every sports fan.  It was a who gives a fuck game at that point, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was 3-0.  Because the Pirates aren't doing shit. 
[00:05:00]  The Pirates have fallen apart.  How bad are the Pirates this year?  The Pirates were really good.  They were going to end their 19 season losing streak.  Yeah.  And then they just fell apart.  And they fell apart.  They're like 7 and 20 something.  They just gave up again.  Terrible.  Pirates, that's a rough organization.  They hold the longest losing streak in sports.  What do you mean?  They haven't had a winning season in how many years?  I think 19 years.  No.  I think it's going to be 19 years, yes.  Holy moly.  Is that a long guy?  Well, yeah.  I mean, the Orioles were 14 until this year because we're awesome. 
[00:05:30]  But yeah, I think they're 19.  19 years in a row with a losing season.  I think behind them now is Kansas City with 9.  Holy fuck.  I didn't know it was that bad.  We haven't paid attention to the Pirates in a long time, right?  Damn.  Since Willie Stargell.  Willie Stargell.  That's going back.  Oh, man.  It's going back.  Yeah, 19 straight losing seasons.  So could we put that video up on our Facebook page?  Sorry up there.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Thank you.  That's our visual for today. 
[00:06:00]  That is a good one.  But I don't know.  I think it works because now we just turned a lot of people on to something.  There you go.  And then maybe they go and go, hey, look what I discovered because Opie and Anthony today.  Yeah.  Who's Opie and Anthony?  Well, they're this radio show that I listen to.  Oh, really?  Maybe I should give them a listen.  That's how that shit works, hopefully.  And then somebody else goes, they fucking suck.  Those guys.  Nice picture.  I mean, the Howard Stern wannabe's.  Shut up, you idiot. 
[00:06:30]  Here is it.  I know.  Penny Marshall's picture's in the paper because she had her big party for her book last night.  My party.  I guess she got a lot of rest in time for the party.  Yeah.  She blew off everybody yesterday.  What dummies that realized to do radio is so much better for your book than a fucking news snippet?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  It doesn't matter, but it's just like, ugh.  Yeah, we didn't need to talk to her that day.  No.  It was just the principle of the whole fucking thing.  We had plenty of good guests.  How dare Penny Marshall blow us off.  Yeah, we did. 
[00:07:00]  Damien Echols.  We got rave reviews for that appearance.  Yes.  He was amazing.  He was great.  He did a great job.  Did you see some of his tweets last night?  Because I'm following him now.  Yeah.  Some of his tweets are like, he was staying at a hotel.  I won't say which one.  I guess you could look now, but whatever.  He tweeted about it.  And he's just like, this place is creepy.  Like, they're depressing.  Like, you just get this air about him.  Oh, boy.  But, like, it's a hotel.  You think after being in prison so long, you just be like, this place is great. 
[00:07:30]  You think anything comfortable is really creepy for him?  Maybe.  Maybe that's it.  Because don't you just kind of, I don't know, settle in?  Yeah.  He probably sleeps, like, in the closet or something.  He was, like, wondering if it's haunted.  He was wondering if it was haunted.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  It's a horrendously sad and depressing atmosphere.  What hotel?  The Chelsea Hotel.  Chelsea.  I mean, he tweeted.  Oh, he chose that.  Yeah.  That's a lot of people go there.  Isn't that where Sid and Nancy bought it?  Yeah, he was just visiting.  No. 
[00:08:00]  Well, he's into that stuff.  Like the Chateau Marmont kind of thing.  Right, right.  It's a big spot to stay here.  Yeah.  It's where Dylan Thomas died.  Yeah.  It's a very famous hotel, but I don't think they're keeping up with it.  No.  It's probably just falling apart.  Right?  Ghosts and stuff are supposed to be there.  Yeah.  He was just like, it's just haunted.  It's just a sad place.  It's like, man, go to a nice modern hotel.  He chose that, obviously.  Yeah, yeah.  I guess he likes that.  When he knew he was coming to New York, he's like, let's stay at the Sid and Nancy Hotel.  Yeah.  A lot of people do that. 
[00:08:30]  Well, he may not have realized it was run down.  It's a horrible area, right?  No, it's on 23rd Street.  I remember walking by it a couple times.  Is there a comedy club down that way or something?  Gotham.  That's why.  It's 23rd and 7th.  Okay.  I think this is on 23rd.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  I'd stay at the fucking, I don't know, somewhere nice.  I'd stay in Gentleman's Accommodation.  Yes.  You wouldn't stay at that hotel just to kind of check it out?  I would have Kenny check the Bed Bug Registry first, which he does every time we travel.  The Bed Bug Registry.  Yeah.  Hello. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  This place is wonderful.  I'm so paranoid about getting bed bugs.  That's why you can't go, fucking savages come here and just dirty up the fucking hotels  now.  That's what it is, too.  Yeah.  You make these fucking, fucking foreigners.  Dude, I don't put my luggage on the bed ever.  I put on the table and the thing.  I'm fucking so paranoid about one of those little fuckers hitching a ride.  Oh, man.  Hitching a ride back to your apartment.  Yeah.  Laying little bed bug babies.  A little itchy.  You got Morella, though, man.  She'll fucking search out the bed bugs. 
[00:09:30]  She'll execute those fuckers.  What, she like that fucking dog?  Who?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She could sniff out some shit.  Yo, where's Rascal?  Yeah, Morella could sniff out some shit.  Me and Jimmy share a cleaning lady for people that don't know.  A lot of times she brings over used towels and just reuses them on my place.  But she has awful feet.  She's great, though.  But you get to see her hiney crack when she bends over to scrub your turlet.  The feet would just ruin everything.  Like, even the hiney crack.  Oh, when you get those awful feet. 
[00:10:00]  There's nothing better than just a little hiney crack with the jeans.  On a Mexican maid?  I'm just saying in general.  Yeah.  I saw another girl yesterday at Caroline's.  Oh, yeah.  I was filming a little something for Joe DeRozan.  And then we were just hanging out, having a little dinner and a couple beers.  And there was a girl there.  And just a little hiney crack showing.  Well, that's good.  The jeans went down just a little bit.  Not too much.  That is a nice fucking view.  You know what's better than that?  A lot of hiney cracks showing.  No, it's something about when it's just a little bit in public. 
[00:10:30]  I like that.  I like to take a nice big gander.  A nice big gander.  How was the shoot?  It was fun.  I'm tired, though.  Fucking stood for four hours.  I'm too old for that shit.  And I had to play this weird...  I'm playing this kind of backstage guy.  So I had to kind of scrunch my face the whole time.  It still hurts.  Because I guess I don't scrunch my face as much as I used to.  I had to kind of scowl and stuff.  So right in here is a fucking headache.  How much dialogue was it? 
[00:11:00]  Was it a lot?  Yeah, I had a lot, actually.  We'll see how much they used.  I don't know.  It was fun.  It was just fun to do.  Yeah.  He's easy to work with, Joe.  He's pleasant.  Yeah, he's got some good concepts, too.  Those things are...  And Louis had a surprise show there, but I couldn't wait it out.  Louis C.K. was down at the Carolines.  Oh, really?  Yeah, man.  What?  Sure, why not?  I think I found him.  Yes.  Yeah, okay.  Let me see if he answers.  I think I have a phone number.  Oh, really?  Why not?  Yeah, we want to talk to that guy. 
[00:11:30]  He's a hero.  It's like saying, do you want to talk to the Secretary of State?  Someone's saying, we've got to update our info, that the Chelsea is actually really  nice now.  Is it?  Let me go to Angelo.  Angelo.  What's up, boys?  Hey, man.  I've got two things.  Yeah, that whole area, and I think Jimmy was talking about it before, it's actually so  much nicer.  A new company took over to Chelsea.  They just refurbished the whole thing.  There's a restaurant in the bottom of it.  It's actually pretty rocking right now. 
[00:12:00]  How much do you think a night?  I've never stayed there, or even, I might have been inside briefly once, but it's a pretty  legendary place.  Do you know how much it is to stay there?  Yeah, a hundred bucks and two needles.  You get two free needles.  Look at me.  Angelo.  Yeah, one other thing, Jimmy, if you don't mind, did you ever see the movie Hunger Games?  Yeah, I wound up loving that movie.  Okay, so, you know, with Stanley Tucci's character and the other talk show host, with the smushed  head, that could have been you, Jimmy. 
[00:12:30]  It could have been you, Jimmy.  Hey, you know, I've been doing this for 25 years.  If that's what you're going to take, it's just my head shape.  Stupid Francesca.  Jesus.  Dude, I don't know which, hold on, Angelo.  I don't know which guy that was.  The character that talks with Stanley Tucci as they're monitoring the games, it's a little  character with this big head, he's got this big hairpiece on his head, a little face like  you, it's so cute, round.  Is it kissable?  Oh, so kissable. 
[00:13:00]  All right, thanks.  It's good to be doing this hour.  Why are you so awake, Angelo?  I'm going to take off right now.  I hope.  Oh, good for you.  Where?  I'm going to draw, baby.  Nice.  Have fun, man.  Thank you, boy.  Thank you so much.  I just wanted you to look up that character.  All right, man.  God.  Now, Travis just looked something.  Thank you.  Travis just looked something up and said...  The complete opposite?  Yeah.  That's gone apart?  Well, there's been closed for renovation, so Angela might be right, but where's Damien staying? 
[00:13:30]  No, he's not staying there.  They went to visit it.  Oh.  You could probably go and look around, but you can't stay there.  I didn't realize that.  But if it's renovated, it probably doesn't look all creepy.  You closed for a year to renovate.  That's a lot of work, man.  When you close something for a year...  Right.  Wow.  There's a hotel close to here, and it's voted the worst hotel in New York.  Nice.  Really?  And I walked by there about a year ago, because the paper did something on it.  I was trying to figure out a way to maybe... 
[00:14:00]  What's the place?  ...shoot a video or something.  And I don't know.  It's some hellhole, but it's voted the worst hotel in New York to the point where people  go by just to take pictures of the fucking place.  Is it called Hotel Empire?  I have no idea.  We've got to look it up.  I'm just guessing.  I didn't think we were going to talk about this shit today, or I would have done a little  research.  But it's really close to Midtown.  And it's like a tourist stop, because it's supposedly horrendous.  And people do stay there, because it's the worst hotel, all that shit.  Yeah, it's probably the worst hotel, because, again, there's probably bed bugs. 
[00:14:30]  You've got to be so careful in New York.  Stay at one of the better ones.  Oh, yeah.  The New York Inn?  The New York Inn.  The New York Inn.  Oh, does that sound...  On 8th, between 47th and 48th?  It's got to be.  That's about where I think I was.  What do they say about it?  Blah, blah, blah.  For some reason, I don't remember it being called the New York Inn.  Mice, rats, broken windows, no heat, no hot water, no elevator, decrepit stairs,  rude staff, lack of space, leaky plumbing.  Wow.  Perfect.  Sounds great.  Included breakfast, which is evidently a voucher and a gentle shove towards the nearest Subway 
[00:15:00]  Sandwich Shop.  Wow.  I love how you just described this.  That sounds fucking great.  Can you run through that again?  It went by so fast, I was amazed.  Mice, rats, broken window, no heat, no hot water, no elevator, decrepit stairs, rude staff,  lack of space, leaky plumbing, breakfast at Subway Sandwich Shop.  And see, they get a pass because they're shitty owners, obviously, right?  But then it gets to a point where they're voted the worst hotel in New York, so now 
[00:15:30]  it's a place.  Now you're famous.  Now you're famous.  It's like, why would you fix any of that shit to be just a mediocre hotel?  Mice and rats.  No kidding.  You don't want to stay there?  Fuck, dude.  That sounds awful.  You know, that's got to be the dregs of society staying there.  They come to New York and just don't even care.  Like tourists would come there and just, yeah.  I swear to you, maybe I'll do it soon.  I'll just, I'll stay there a night.  Just to check it out.  I mean, their website looks good.  It's a budget-friendly midtown hotel.  Ideally situated. 
[00:16:00]  Budget-friendly.  Just two blocks from Times Square.  Budget-friendly.  You know what?  This is what I'll do.  I'll stay the night.  I'll roll around with the bedbugs.  And then I'll call Kenny in the morning.  Kenny will be at my door with fresh clothes.  And then I'll just leave my clothes behind, change in the hallway, and get the fuck out of it.  You could do that.  I bet you that would work.  You won't bring them home if you don't.  Like, if you bring a little overnight bag and you put it on, like, you're the luggage thing that they give you in the closet.  If you put it on that, like, you open that up and you're not going to get them. 
[00:16:30]  Let's stay there.  Film some shit.  I don't want no bedbugs.  No?  You wouldn't stay at the worst hotel in New York?  No.  You wouldn't go there, Ed?  Never.  I need room service.  They don't have an elevator, so you go with the stairs.  But the stairs are decrepit.  And I like a good hotel bar.  I like hitting a hotel bar.  TripAdvisor, it's only number 359 in New York out of 430.  What does that mean?  And hotels.  Like, it's ranked.  Not the worst.  So it's not the worst.  Not the worst, according to TripAdvisor. 
[00:17:00]  You know what?  Two and a half stars.  New York Inn doesn't sound familiar to me.  Empire sounds like it to me for some reason.  There was an article.  So, I don't know.  You've got to go back about a year.  And they did a whole thing on hotels, the worst hotels in New York or something like that.  Peninsula.  Hotel Carter?  That might be it.  Carter sounds more familiar.  Okay.  Hang on.  Give me a little street view.  Hang on.  Let's hear about the Hotel Carter.  The Hotel Carter.  Give me the street view of the Hotel Carter.  Hotel Carter's on West 43rd. 
[00:17:30]  And what?  See?  Still Midtown-ish.  That might be it.  And?  I know I just said that already, but fuck it.  I'll say it again.  This might be it.  Tell us about it.  Yeah.  Tell us about the Hotel Carter.  You know what?  I think this is it.  This sounds way more familiar.  Are they saying it's the worst?  Hotel Carter.  Bed bugs.  Dirty towels in the bathroom.  Pubic hair everywhere.  Fungus.  Graffiti on the furniture.  Rats that eat your food in the middle of the night.  Faulty door locks.  Uncaring staff.  That sounds fantastic. 
[00:18:00]  I've got to go.  Well, let's see what their website says.  Wow.  Enjoy the warm hospitality and service at Hotel Carter.  A unique and inviting departure from traditional hotels.  It's close to you, man.  That picture.  Oh, that's an old picture.  It's from like 19 fucking...  Yeah, it's good.  There's a helicopter.  Like 60.  Yeah, it's an old helicopter.  It's an old school postcard from, you know, back in the day.  It's inviting, it says.  It's inviting.  It's inviting.  It's an inviting departure from traditional hotels.  Oh, okay.  With 700 rooms, all with private baths. 
[00:18:30]  That's great.  Hey, look.  A bathroom in the room.  If you're some schmuck from the Midwest, you're thinking, honey, I think I found our New York  City hotel.  Look at this.  Look at the website.  What else does it say, though?  You'll get a...  So you'll get a...  Yeah, read all the shit from the...  700 rooms.  Yeah, with 700 rooms, you'll get a close-up view of New York City's Times Square.  Nice.  You can even catch the spectacular ball drop on New Year's.  Wow.  Located in the heart of the theater district in Times Square with major bus and train lines  at our front door.  We are a half block from the Port Authority bus terminal. 
[00:19:00]  Oh, wow.  It's really good.  You really want to be as close there as possible.  Holy shit.  This sounds really good.  Now go to the reviews again, please.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, reviews.  I'm not going to be good.  No.  Oh, well, I'd have to go to TripAdvisor.  Hang on.  Oh.  All right.  That sounds worse than the other place.  It's a great exercise, though.  Hotel Carter.  It's always...  Or the description you just read a little while ago with the pubic hair and all that.  Let's see where they rank.  I like... 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Hotel Carter.  Oh, 344.  Out of how many?  430.  Great location.  Worst hotel ever is one of the reviews.  Yeah.  What do they say?  Although I have...  Yes, they have a great location.  Staff was attentive.  Old and overused beds.  Dirty rooms.  Dirty, and I mean dirty.  Bathrooms.  Mold.  Extra mold.  Broken doors.  Broken curtains.  Broken lamps.  Broken furniture.  Broken windows.  Someone behind the front desk goes, we got the room for you, and you go up and everything's 
[00:20:00]  busted and rats and dirty.  And there's mold all over the place.  It was a beautiful night of snow showers, and we had snow showers inside the room.  Oh, fuck.  Fantastic location, but poor hotel.  Room very, very dirty.  Bathroom and carpet and sheet above all.  And quite rumorous, but hotel in a very, very central position.  Near Trafalgar Square. 
[00:20:30]  That sounds like a fucking...  Oh, it's funny.  Crazy.  The dirtiest and dingiest hotel I've stayed at.  Even the bed bugs won't stay here.  Wow.  Chip likes that.  Fucking good.  The front desk staff were curt, to say the least.  When I complained about the bathroom having mold on the ceiling and affecting my asthma,  the receptionist sort of shrugged her shoulders and said, we have no other rooms, and continued  to deal with the next person behind me. 
[00:21:00]  The beds are lumpy, uncomfortable, and dirty.  Even the bed bugs have left.  I have traveled a lot.  Stands of poorly maintained.  Dirty hotel.  Never again.  Who would...  Well, you don't know, though.  I mean, for us, it's obvious.  But you're coming in from another place, you hear Hotel Carter.  You're like, that sounds all right.  Times Square.  Please read.  Named after a president.  Why don't you go here?  It is terrible.  Not clean.  Terrible maid service.  People say it's a good location.  Well, yes, it is true.  But it is worth your... 
[00:21:30]  But is it worth your health?  Don't waste your money.  You want to pay to suffer?  Check in at the local animal shops.  They'll have better rooms for you there.  Wow, this place sounds terrible.  Yeah, we should stay there.  Although someone said not that bad.  Yeah, someone...  Yeah.  Where was the...  We just had a pretty good...  Really not that bad.  Three out of five star reviews.  Oh, my God.  After reading some of the reviews on here, it was with a certain...  amount of trepidation, we checked into this pre-booked hotel for our trip to New York.  Yes, it is old, yet it is run down. 
[00:22:00]  What a location for the price.  Wow.  We were also pleasantly surprised to find a clean, comfortable room with a huge bed,  with a small, serviceable bathroom, and really could not find anything to complain about.  Oh, boy.  Oh, my God.  These are filthy animals.  Signed the manager.  The sheets and towels were changed every other day.  That's good.  Yeah.  I'm not too sure what people expect for the price.  I don't know how much that costs.  You know...  Let's try and book a room.  When you think about, like, Damien doing all those years on death row, like, if he stayed  there, he'd probably be like, this is fine. 
[00:22:30]  Like, it's not great, but compared to where I was, mosquitoes crawling all over me, this  is fucking the digs.  Holy fuck.  I like the one review where everything was broken.  That's just hilarious.  Just busted.  Yeah, how much is this?  I'm trying to find out.  I would love to have Kenny check the Hotel Carter for me, for a guest.  You know, James, it's no good, Jim.  Oh, God.  Imagine that.  You just send him there.  Yeah.  See what he says.  Everything seems to be booked up.  Yeah, because a lot of people come here, I guess, with no money, right?  Wait, they're booked? 
[00:23:00]  $99 rooms are showing.  Look.  Wow.  In fucking Midtown?  I think this is the place that the paper wrote about.  That's pretty good.  Yeah.  Any night that I try, it's booked up.  See all those prices right there?  Oh, where?  Right there.  All the prices.  Wait, with all those shitty reviews and pecking red, which is obviously booked.  Oh.  Yeah, $99.  $99.  But it's booked.  Yeah.  Hotels in New York City go for $300, $400, $500. 
[00:23:30]  Easy.  Yeah.  And then they raise it from there.  Yep.  $500, $600, $700 if something's happening.  These are broke people.  Who knows why people are coming here?  It could be they're coming here just to visit or whatever it is.  Well, you save money on the sleeping so you can spend more money out and about.  I like the one where it was snowing in their room.  But there's a reason it's so cheap.  There's a reason it's so cheap.  Stayed here for one night.  Had to ask to move room twice.  First room, smoke alarm would not stop beeping.  Second, toilet was leaking all over the floor. 
[00:24:00]  Plugs are hanging out of the walls with wires showing.  Hotel is dirty, old, and cheap.  Cheap for New York City, but I would recommend staying somewhere else if you can afford it.  70 pounds a night.  Sorry.  70 pounds a night.  So they flew across the ocean and stayed there.  Yes.  Doesn't that make you so happy?  It's so terrible.  But now people are going to go there.  Not at all disappointed.  You know, there's some people with very low expectations.  Yes.  Who knew it was terrible.  They probably expected a dump for 99 bucks.  And now we fly back to the Sudan. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  They're probably leaving their house that is filled with, you know, cat poo.  Yes.  This reminds me of the place I was de-clitted.  Oh, wow.  I'm warning you.  Do not stay.  That guy has a long review.  Wow.  This guy's pissed.  We came in early.  The room wasn't ready.  They let us leave our luggage at their storage room with a fee of $2 a bag.  We left one lady's purse, a backpack, and a luggage bag.  The guy said we could put them all together as one.  Went out and explored the city.  Came back. 
[00:25:00]  Came back.  Found out that one of the bags wasn't there anymore.  Ah.  Nice.  Asked if you could call, check security cams.  Manager said, we cannot.  You have to call 911.  So their bag was ripped off?  We went to the NYPD.  Right.  Told them what happened.  Two officers went with us.  Blah, blah, blah.  And even if they were saying the hotel should be able to get access to their own cameras  without a police presence, but I was glad they still came back.  They would view the cameras, and it showed someone just took the bag over the counter 
[00:25:30]  while the security person supposedly wasn't there.  Oh, my God.  It was so obvious that it was negligence on the hotel's part.  Wow.  Yeah, we should stay here.  Sounds good.  Thieves.  Busted shit.  Oh.  Jesus.  He's the worst.  You know these mics work, right?  Good morning, guys.  Hi, Mark.  What do you got there?  It says crack.  It's another MMA shirt.  Why would you whisper knowing the mics are going to pick it up?  You're an engine.  You're an audio engineer. 
[00:26:00]  Travis.  There's a...  I think everyone has.  There's videos on YouTube.  How about some gay sex later?  You like your ass eating after a hard day of sitting and Googling?  Same time, same place.  Wow, yeah, look at this.  There's some fucking YouTubers.  My Carter Hotel experience.  Who turned the vibe up on it?  Yeah, sure.  Oh, no, you know this.  They're going to be so good.  They're playing some music.  They're showing New York City. 
[00:26:30]  They're showing the New York Times building.  This looks nice.  Yeah, Times Square.  Times Square, 2009.  So they came in town for the ball drop.  That, uh-oh.  Music is lowering.  Now, they're showing all this panoramic views of New York.  And pigeons.  Pigeons.  Okay, this looks like it might be the hotel.  Very New York-y.  Garbage.  Garbage everywhere.  It's getting uglier.  Yeah, somehow they...  They're showing everything.  I love New York coffee mugs. 
[00:27:00]  It's just a bunch of scenes of Times Square.  Sure.  Hotel car.  All right, here we go.  Hotel car.  Hotel car.  All right.  Again.  Yeah.  You always want it in the Times Square and let with it.  I don't know what that is.  This is it.  Because I walked up into the lobby.  He's opening it.  And walked up the steps.  The music gets ominous.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  It looks like the start of a horror movie.  The footage you are about to see 
[00:27:30]  was taken on February 6th and 7th of 2009.  Oh, dirty rug.  Major dirty stains on the rug.  One block away from Times Square.  Right now, just...  The Hotel Dixie opened on April 22nd, 1930.  It's changed names over there.  It is 24 stories high.  And on its opening, it had 1,000 rooms.  Wow.  1,000 rooms?  This guy. 
[00:28:00]  In 1977, Trang bought the Hotel Dixie  and changed it to its current name, the Hotel Carter.  Hotel Carter.  Oh, he's an Asian guy, yeah.  Always here.  Oh, Hotel Carter always here.  From the time of Mr. Tran's ownership,  the events in the building have increasingly become  disturbingly bad or something.  Oh, what is that?  Wow.  Horrible stains.  That looks like a blood stain.  Looks like blood.  Mr. Tran's a shitbag.  Wow.  Look at the broken light in the fucking...  Broken lights in the hallway, just tilted.  That's a fire hazard.  Look at that fucking flop house, it looks like.  Wow. 
[00:28:30]  Is that it?  That's part one.  Oh, no.  All right, here we go.  Wow.  Plaster is just falling off the wall.  New York sued the Carter for its failure to...  Are they playing radio?  Wait, the fucking...  It's going by too fast, unfortunately.  This idiot doesn't know how to do graphics on a video.  Can you just pause for a second?  Yeah, pause.  There's a sign, it was 831, 839, and it's, like, written in marker.  On a piece of sheet metal that's literally nailed to the wall.  In marker. 
[00:29:00]  All right, there's plaster falling off the wall.  Plaster's all chipped off.  What's that?  Wall in the hallway.  Yeah, read this shit, Jimmy, please.  Got the plaster.  There's plaster all over the dirty...  In 83 and 84, a city sued Carter for failure to correct numerous infractions.  As a result, Mr. Tran was held in contempt of court and had to pay a $10,000 fine.  In 85?  Yeah, 85.  Righteous.  They're just showing a filthy montage of door...  Holy fuck, everything just rotting.  Graffiti everywhere.  There's graffiti on the doors.  Between 84 and 88, he turned the hotel into a homeless shelter. 
[00:29:30]  Oh, man.  Oh, boy.  I need to make money.  Pause, pause, pause.  I mean, the guy's a pretty good filmmaker, because it's...  But there's just holes punched through the doors of your room.  Yeah.  There's graffiti on a bunch of the doors.  Who says this place is okay?  The building was neglected is what we're up there.  Not bad for $100.  Hey, you know what?  The building was neglected.  Yeah, it's terrible.  It's like all just...  And criminal activity was disturbing and brutal.  Nice.  Holy fuck. 
[00:30:00]  This is the 80s, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, he's going to update it.  In 83, a resident beat his 25-day-old infant child to death.  Jesus.  Yes.  Wow.  In 88, all families were removed from the corridor due to issues of plumbing, electricity, security,  and vermin.  Wow.  In 89, a relative of Tran was sued for bribing a building inspector in an effort to not get  a fire safety violation.  This Tran's awful.  This guy had it, because he knows he was tricked.  In 87, a woman was thrown out of a window from one of the top floors. 
[00:30:30]  When the police found her body, she was hardly clothed, and her arms were tied behind her back.  Nice.  This place is great.  It's rules.  In 1988...  Wow.  That's when he moved to New York.  The car was separately closed due to damaged fire escape.  December of 99, Sean Combs and girlfriend Jennifer Lopez arrived at a club that used to be located...  What?  Yeah, that just goes so fast.  That used to be located on the first floor.  It was.  Okay.  Wait, this was the place where... 
[00:31:00]  That's where the shooting was, right?  Was it?  No.  Let's see.  They're just showing filthy rugs.  A shooting occurred that police accused Combs and a friend were responsible for starting.  Oh, that was there?  I guess that was.  An innocent bystander was shot in the face.  I don't remember that.  Other than showing dirty door handles.  Although Combs was found not guilty, his limo driver made a police report stating that Combs  offered him $50,000 to admit that the gun he had was his.  Remember that?  Yeah, of course. 
[00:31:30]  That doesn't have anything to do with the hotel.  I didn't know it was the Carter.  In also 99, a clerk murdered a fellow co-worker during a brawl near the front desk.  Fuck!  He's the hammer and a knife to do the brutal killing.  Is this the Overlook?  Yeah.  Oh, it's not right there.  You know, in 1921, a caretaker murdered his wife and children when they stole matches  and tried to burn it down.  Yes, a man was playing handball against the wall and scuffed it. 
[00:32:00]  A 2005 building engineer was killed due to blood leaking out of it.  No, due to a freak elevator malfunction.  A building engineer in 2005?  Only seven patches of product.  Oh, fuck.  In September of 2007.  Wow.  Serial sex offender Clarence Dean murdered a woman in room 608.  Wow.  What the fuck would stay here?  This place is amazing.  Convicted serial murderer.  Dean strangled the girl and left her under the room's bed until a maid found her 12 days later. 
[00:32:30]  I remember that.  Pause.  You do?  Yeah, yeah.  I remember the body under the bed for so many days and people were actually going in and  sleeping and staying in the room with the dead body under the bed and someone started  complaining about a smell.  It was under the...  And then they just didn't care.  Was it under the bed or did they take the bed frame out?  It was a platform bed, yeah.  Remember that?  A platform bed.  They took the mattress out, put her in the little platform thing, and then put the box  spring and mattress back down.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:33:00]  I do recall that.  I sort of remember that now, yeah.  This is insane.  This fucking hotel's insane.  Yeah.  Wow.  He's just dingy looking.  It's horrible.  A lot at it.  There's so many bad scenes he's showing.  Just so much garbage.  Feedy and shit just rotting off the walls.  Yeah.  The tower in front of the fucking...  Sorry.  A tower in front of the door because there's a leak of some sort.  The numbers on the rooms are those stick-on numbers that you see people, the cheap ones 
[00:33:30]  they put on their mailboxes.  Just buying them at the hardware store.  Yeah, yeah.  Everything.  Wow.  Love this phone.  Every lock on the doors look like they've been hit with cameras.  And the hotel car was voted the dirtiest hotel in the U.S. for the fourth time in a row.  There you go.  Yeah.  We found it.  Why wouldn't he clean it in the U.S.?  I need to make money.  Because he knows people will just stay there.  I woke up to a bunch of guys breaking into our room while we were asleep.  The room had four locks on the door and all of them were broken by the men except for 
[00:34:00]  the chain lock.  Holy shit.  I guess these are quotes of people's reviews.  No, it's this guy.  Oh.  No, guest.  Oh, okay.  Guest from Philly.  Right.  Oh, fucking Philly.  Wow.  I love the quotes.  Just horrible.  Yeah.  Gangny.  Fucking gangny.  Oh, my God.  This dirt just plied up in the corner.  Was that a rat nest?  A rat nest, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Just in the hallway?  Yep.  Wow.  Hostile guests to go to any of the floors. 
[00:34:30]  Prohibited for hostile guests.  Oh, it's a hostile, too.  Oh, God.  In the next segment, you will see my experience in room 839.  Oh, fuck.  We're all in.  I think there's a nude woman in the tub.  She looked attractive at first.  839.  Wow.  We're all in.  Let's go part two.  Go to room 839, Doc.  E-Rod, get this video up on our Facebook page.  Do you like rat's nest, Doc?  And explain why it's up there for the people that maybe won't hear this show today.  Do you want to do part two?  Oh, God, yeah. 
[00:35:00]  More than I want fucking...  There's a new Star Trek.  Oh.  He's holding the 839.  His hands up.  He's wearing gloves.  The 8th floor.  He's not supposed to go in there.  Yeah.  839.  I'm not supposed to.  Who says you're not supposed to?  It's just silent footage of him walking down this fucking dirty, dirty hallway.  Every bit of metal is punched in, too.  Yeah.  Like, anything that could be punched and dented is... 
[00:35:30]  Wow, the Dixie was probably nice.  Oh, yeah.  Ah, the Dixie.  I want to stay in the serial killer room, please.  Why wouldn't...  But why wouldn't you make some effort just to keep it kind of clean?  Like...  Man, I don't know if I could stay here now.  Why not?  He's pushing the door open.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  This is his room.  It's a few rooms.  He opens it.  There's a big garbage can.  What the fuck is this?  It's a hallway with a few...  Oh, he's just showing you the hallway.  Oh, he's in...  He's just kind of showing the floor he's on.  Oh, okay.  That's like a utility room or something. 
[00:36:00]  It was filthy.  Okay.  Yeah, he's just...  So you open up a...  Walking back down the hall.  Right.  He's just showing the walls.  Yeah, he passed his room a while ago.  He's just showing you the floor.  Yeah.  The rug is awful.  Just very dingy.  Sounds quiet, though.  Oh, nicely.  Inside room 839.  The closet.  Hold on.  His wires are hanging down.  The rug is filthy.  There's no door on the closet.  It's just...  The bed isn't even made.  Wow.  And I'm sure he's just checking into his room. 
[00:36:30]  Nice TV.  Wow.  Those camera and stuff are on the awful fucking nightstand.  Holy shit.  The furniture's horrendous.  Graffiti inside the drawers.  And I'm doing a little bit more investigational work.  Here we go.  Old 2006-2007 phone book.  A phone book.  I didn't hear.  Somebody wrote something in 1995.  Wow.  Big Van Halen fan, I guess.  It says VH.  I hope they're still... 
[00:37:00]  Whatever.  Oh, couples that are together.  Yeah.  It's just like falling apart.  Wow.  The bed's falling out of the fucking room.  Holy shit.  The headboard of the bed is pulled out of the wall.  You see nails.  It's pretty...  An old fucking phone on the...  A dingy dresser.  Oh, my God.  With no handles anymore.  The bed's not made.  Very old, nasty little air conditioner in the window.  You can see the box springs.  It's a window unit. 
[00:37:30]  You can see wires that are such a fire hazard.  Wires and steam pipes that are going into holes that are like just...  You can tell mice have been chiseling away at things.  Oh, the door is all...  All moldy.  And it looks like people have tried to jimmy the lock every...  This is new.  This is totally brand new.  Wow.  It's pretty ghetto.  Pretty ghetto.  A light fixture that's been twisted.  With a bug just...  Big bug in it, right?  Yeah, making its way up to the top of it. 
[00:38:00]  At 6, I return to my main headquarters at the Mayfair Hotel six blocks away from the Carter for a nap.  Oh, she's not staying there.  It's now 1 o'clock in the morning, New York time, and I'm going back to the Carter Hotel now to go check it out.  To be perfectly honest, I'm very scared, and, you know, I just...  It really wasn't...  I mean, the overall look of the building is very scary in general, but it was just kind of the feeling of the building.  It felt really awful, but I'm going to go back, and we're going to see what's going on with Carter. 
[00:38:30]  1 in the morning.  Room 89 continued, looking a little deeper.  Should have home base at the Mayfair.  Oh, dirty sheets.  What is on that?  It's like blood.  That's blood.  That's probably from bed bugs, because when you see that blood stuff, that's from bed bugs.  Oh, it's on the pillow.  Yeah, it's on the pillow.  Wow.  On the bed that's not made.  Now she's pulling everything off the bed to get to the...  The sheets to get to the mattress.  Oh, big fucking piss stains on the mattress. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, my God.  Blood stains.  Blood stains.  Wow.  That's like a period.  Or a giant...  It's like a giant circular piss stain or whatever it is.  Piss stain.  And then some blood.  Oh, the pillow.  The pillow's ripped.  All the foam is coming out of the pillow.  It's sticking out of the pillow.  She pulled the pillow out of the pillowcase.  Oh, God.  It's stained.  Yuck.  It's yellow.  The pillow is yellow.  Would you stay here, Jimmy?  Oh, no.  I would fucking...  I would execute, Kenny, if you booked this. 
[00:39:30]  I did it with miles.  How many?  One mile.  One mile.  It's all you need.  Merely a mile.  Wow, man.  The horrible fucking...  Oh, wow.  What's that?  The filthy stained corner of the bottom box of the mattress.  It's blood on it.  It's fucking blood.  It looks like there's just a lot of old blood on this one.  It's filthy.  Caked with filth. 
[00:40:00]  Is that where they put Lincoln?  After his little theater experience.  You should stay in the room for the night.  No.  This lady's doing a documentary.  These are so dirty.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Who would stay?  Just imagine the filthiest mattress, really.  I don't think I've seen worse.  So, I'm in my room right now, and I was just taking apart the bedspreads and the pillows  and whatnot, as you saw in the previous footage.  And I just took apart the entire bed to try to get a better look at this blood that's 
[00:40:30]  all over this spring box.  Here is the box spring.  Uh-oh.  So, we were right.  It was blood.  Holy shit.  Wow, what's going on there?  The foot of the box spring is just a shitload of blood.  And then it looks like a dragged blood stain.  Is that where the dead body was or no?  I don't know.  Probably not.  I wouldn't...  Oh, man.  There is so much blood.  What's going on there?  Caked on it.  Caked on the bottom of this box spring. 
[00:41:00]  Hilarious.  Wow.  This has to be bedbugs.  That could be bedbugs.  It really could be.  That's a lot of blood.  Yeah, not that much.  That's a lot of blood.  Come on.  It also looks like the mattress could have been standing up and been wet, and it was running  down.  Maybe, yeah.  She's saying it's blood.  It kind of looks like it could...  I'll take her work for it.  It's like it could be.  It's red.  It's red, right?  Brownish, yeah.  Oh, nice plug.  Horrible plug in the bathroom. 
[00:41:30]  It's dangerous.  You wouldn't plug anything into that.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Old, old e-time license.  Oh, the shower.  All right.  Shower.  Oh.  Oh.  Filthy spigot.  Oh, my God.  The water's brown or something.  The water was...  It was brown, right?  Oh.  What?  Uh-oh, what?  What, lady?  The brown water.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:42:00]  The water was brown.  Coming out of the fucking shower.  The garbage can is so fucking dirty.  Oh, God.  No bag in it.  Bag.  Oh.  What?  The toilet looks all right.  What is there, like?  The toilet doesn't look bad.  The plumbing's horrendous, but the toilet...  So, um, I just, uh, I just left the Carter Hotel, and as I was leaving, one of the, uh,  lovely, uh, bellboys decided to leave me, um, this nice little present that was, uh, sitting  in his pocket for probably the last, like, seven and a half years. 
[00:42:30]  Ah!  Um, he had a crush on me, and, um...  It's like one of those chocolate-covered cherries.  He doesn't have a front tooth, and, um, throwing whatever...  date rape drug you just gave me.  She returned to the Mayfair Hotel at 3 a.m.  Hmm.  I guess she liked the Mayfair.  She returned to the Carter at 9 a.m. to check out.  Okay.  This is what I discovered.  Oh, shit.  Oh, okay.  The thing is, is, um, when I got into my room that I was supposed to sleep in last night, 
[00:43:00]  I noticed that the bathroom...  At this point in the footage, I suddenly felt the urge to look around the room, she said.  I was scared that someone else was in the room.  I didn't use the bathroom at all.  I...  Wow, the toilet...  I didn't pee on the seat.  Oh, no.  Toilet paper in the bowl. 
[00:43:30]  And piss on the seat.  And piss on the seat.  Somebody came in to my room.  Right.  I cannot believe what has happened.  I'm getting out of here right now.  Somebody came into a room.  The hotel probably doesn't activate their key cards for specific rooms, which means that  one key card enables you to get into every room in the building.  The guy at the desk was delighted that I even bothered checking out and returning the key cards.  Wow.  Before I left, I filmed the hotel's lobby, trying not to look suspicious. 
[00:44:00]  Soon after, a guard approached me and said the filming was not allowed.  Yeah, great.  Wow.  That's not a nice place.  Jesus.  That was kind of creepy, no?  Yeah, man.  Somebody used her bathroom.  That's fucked up.  When she should have been sleeping in that room.  She would have been in the room sleeping and someone would have just come in.  Supposedly, Louis had some kind of...  Like, that happened to him in Russia.  Like, he came back and there was somebody in his room or something when he went to Moscow. 
[00:44:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Her room at the Mayfair.  Where I received over 50 bed bug bites.  Wow.  Although this was very painful and embarrassing, I would still take this place over to the  Carter Hotel.  Look at her stuff all over the fucking bed.  Yeah.  By the way, when you go back, you can see on her, it looks like on her neck she has a  couple of little red bumps.  Oh, my God.  50 bed bug bites.  Yeah, that's definitely the place. 
[00:45:00]  Horrible.  Who is this woman?  Why'd she do it?  Yeah, maybe a little documentary.  But, um...  Aspiring filmmaker or something?  50 bed bugs bites.  You probably heard about it.  I mean, people know about this place and they stay there because it's so awful.  She had her shit laid all over the bed.  I would love to contact her and say, did you get bed bugs at home?  Bring them home.  Wow.  Look at the date rape drug in that chocolate covered cherry.  Let me go to, uh, uh, Tony.  Tony, what's up, buddy? 
[00:45:30]  Hey, eh?  Hey, I grew up in, uh, Buffalo.  We took a, uh, class trip to New York City, like in 86, 87.  I forget when, but, uh, cheapest place to stay was at Carter, so we all stayed at the  Carter.  I mean, you walked in, it was like a shooting gallery with, like, just drug addicts and  prostitutes just hanging around, and it was just absolutely disgusting, and, you know,  I'd be in 17 or 16, and I was like, wow, this is the greatest place in the world.  I swear it was unbelievable back then, right?  You know, all the three-card money and everything you could do, but, uh... 
[00:46:00]  Good old days.  I don't know, like, like, three months later or something, 60 Minutes did an expose, like  the worst hotel in America, and, like, all the parents were outraged that, you know,  that the teacher put our kids in harm's way with that.  Oh, shit.  Can we find their expose?  I would love to see that.  A teacher decided that was the hotel?  Yeah.  Could you see if you can find the 60 Minutes expose?  On what?  I'm sorry, I was trying to figure out how to get on the Carter.  Hopefully YouTube or something, yeah. 
[00:46:30]  They did an expose.  60 Minutes on the Carter?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Or on the worst hotels, I think.  Do you want me to send this girl a message?  Like, do you have any interest in talking to her?  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, sure.  She still checks her.  She signed into YouTube yesterday, so she's still...  Yeah, absolutely.  We can talk to her tomorrow if we don't get her today.  Yeah.  Thank you, sir.  He's gone.  She's in Oregon, so I doubt we'd talk to her today.  Right.  Yeah, right.  She looked like she was from Oregon, didn't she?  Maybe later in the show.  She had a Pacific Northwest look to her, didn't she?  Yeah, a little eye ring.  Yeah, yeah.  But I thought I saw a couple of red welts, and that's probably where that was from. 
[00:47:00]  Holy...  50 Bed Bug Bites from the Better Hotel.  That's terrible.  Both of those videos are on our Facebook page.  Hers?  Our Facebook page?  The ones that we just watched.  Are on our Facebook page.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Check it out.  Yeah, you gotta see it for yourself.  Hotel Carter, New York CBS.  You would have sworn that that place was abandoned for like 10 years, and she just opened up some  doors and took a look around.  Well, that was pictures from CBS?  Yeah, that was just the top 10.  Oh, okay.  America's 30th. 
[00:47:30]  This place is famous for being fucking a shithole.  Yeah.  So who would stay there?  Well, because it's a shithole and it's famous for being a shithole, that's enough for people  to stay there.  That's how that shit works.  I don't get it.  If the guy fixed it up a little bit, he would be fucked.  People would be like, ah, what the fuck?  People come here.  People come here, love the shithole.  What was the worst part?  Like the gang graffiti on your hotel room door?  Somebody walking into your fucking room in the middle of the night.  Just the filth and grime and blood on the mattress and blood on the pillow. 
[00:48:00]  That's fucking horrible, man.  How's he still in business?  Why doesn't the city just shut him down?  Yeah, the Board of Health or something, no?  Yeah, he's probably got what they call, you know, those rights that they give people for  things like this.  They shouldn't just fucking throw him out of the city.  Yeah.  Tran!  Ah!  You better than hotel I come from, Vietnam!  Yeah. 
[00:48:30]  Yeah.  You probably ran the fucking, uh, the, uh, oh, God.  Oh, the POW camp.  Yeah, what's it called?  The, uh, Hanoi Hilton.  I was manager of Hanoi Hilton!  All right, if you find that, let us know.  I, yeah, I don't know.  It seems like it's an old piece, unfortunately.  It might be impossible.  That stuff is still kind of hard to find online.  Let's listen!  If anyone else finds it, give me a link.  Someone would have had to videotape it and then transfer the VHS to YouTube.  Yeah, you're right.  It's amazing what's on, uh, it's online, though, sometimes. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  Nothing immediately comes in.  It's real shit.  Uh, Tony Saragusa's coming in today.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, 7.45.  What does he do?  Football guy.  Sideline guy.  Sideline guy on Fox.  I have no idea.  He was part of the, uh, the Ravens Super Bowl team.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  When they beat the Giants.  I have no idea.  You know him.  You know this guy.  You might.  Yeah, I mean, you...  Full of personality.  You know him.  Tony Rockihara.  You know him.  He's doing, like, O.J.'s role.  On the sidelines. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  You know?  I don't know.  I bet I...  They go to him, hey, Tony, what do you think?  Hey, you know, man.  Let's see what he looks like.  That guy.  All right.  I've seen him.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  He blew us off, and we made a stink, so now he's coming on our show, but...  He looks...  Is he exhausting?  He's a talker.  He looks exhausting.  He looks like one of these big Italian guys.  Yeah, he's good, though.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  All right.  Can we cancel?  Ah, I'm canceling.  You talk to him. 
[00:50:00]  I'm not talking to him.  He's part of one of the greatest defenses ever.  Oh.  All right.  You sit right there, and you talk to him.  We'll watch.  I'm good.  I got stuff to do.  We're going to watch your interviews.  This is a test.  Every once in a while, we've got to give you guys tests.  Nah, I'm not an on-air guy.  Come on.  Let's make Travis do this.  Whatever the guys...  Oh, I don't know.  They're not here.  And Jesse Joyce is here today at like 9 o'clock.  You guys don't know Jesse, do you?  No.  Comic.  He's a friend of yours.  Very funny comic.  Good.  Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting him. 
[00:50:30]  Or maybe I know him if I saw his picture.  He used to write a lot of Geraldo stuff for The Roast.  A lot of The Roast, yeah.  He met him before.  He's really funny.  Give me his picture.  Jesse Joyce.  No, I'm excited to have him on the show.  I'm trying to just figure out which one he is.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah, he is very funny.  Should we play his video?  Going to break?  No.  No.  Because you never know if it's a good one or not.  Right.  Well, it's on his website.  I would hope he'd put a good one on his website. 
[00:51:00]  Okay.  All right.  We'll give you a taste of Jesse Joyce.  We'll take him a chance here.  He's going to be on the show in about an hour.  What is this?  It's four minutes long.  Oh, boy.  Oh, jeez.  Well, that didn't work out too well.  I didn't check to see how long that was.  All right.  Iraq, help me.  Oh, Iraq.  Please.  O.P. and Anthony.  This is The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  And now, The O.P. and Anthony Show.  They say you don't tug on Superman's cape. 
[00:51:30]  You don't spit into the wind.  You don't pull a mask on that old, old ranger.  And you don't melt around again.  That's interesting.  But we'll play in the evening.  Is the Iraq game back?  I think the Iraq game is back.  Come, country boy.  I love Jim Crowchill.  I'm a poor man named Jim.  I am a poor shooting boy.  Oh, my name is Willie McCoy.  But now, I'm a poor man named Jim Crowchill.  He's the greatest. 
[00:52:00]  Hey, drive on on him.  Yeah, he's a good singing style.  I do like that.  I'm going to get my money back.  And everybody say that.  Oh, don't you know that you don't tug on Superman's cape.  You don't spit into the wind.  You don't pull a mask on that old, old ranger.  And you don't mess around with Jim.  I play this every time I walk into Scotch's office to negotiate.  Just so I know I'm in business.  What are you doing?  What are you doing? 
[00:52:30]  Come up.  Woo!  Fire.  It's a feel-good song.  Okay, so he's murdering somebody.  Yeah.  I know, but I'm just happier right now.  Nice toe-tapper.  Oh, and you better believe us on the door.  Right.  Exactly.  Big Jim hit the floor.  That's what happened.  And, of course, yes.  You don't tug on the pilot's tie. 
[00:53:00]  Poor guy.  What kind of plane was he in?  Punch up Jim Crowchill's plane.  I want to see what it was.  I just don't.  Oh.  Oh, jeez.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  I thought you were just saying, like, people who are in positions that you shouldn't do that. 
[00:53:30]  And then I realized he died in a plane crash.  Oh, God.  That was terrible.  Whoa.  No, that's not his plane.  That was tight.  That's not his plane.  Look at that car.  There's no way.  Look at how nice the cars are.  Look at how nice the cars are.  This is 39 years ago.  There's his plane.  Is that it?  We lost Jim Crowchill in a plane crash 39 years ago.  Let's see.  He was only 30.  He looked way older than 30.  Is he 30? 
[00:54:00]  Wow.  He looked like he was at least 40, no?  Yeah.  What kind of?  Let me see.  Is it a little?  I have a live album which has a lot of the explanations of all these songs.  He does a little talk before each one.  Yeah.  That's kind of cool.  Are you a big fan of his?  Love Jim Crowchill.  Love him.  Yeah.  It wasn't a big plane.  A little Cessna.  Wow.  A plane.  A little bigger than that, but.  39 years ago.  Damn.  Which is what year?  He wasn't the pilot, was he?  No.  I don't think so.  He didn't fly his own shit.  What happened?  I'm the pilot.  That's very distracting for him. 
[00:54:30]  What happened to the plane?  He died today, huh?  Crash.  According to the results of the investigation, upon takeoff, the plane was not gaining enough  altitude to clear.  The pilot did not maneuver to avoid a pecan tree, or pecan, at the end of the runway.  Cut it down! 
[00:55:00]  Vestia said it was the only tree for hundreds of yards.  Flight conditions were dark, clear sky, calm winds, five miles of visibility.  Wait, the plane hit the only tree?  Wow.  They had to avoid one tree, and they couldn't do that?  Ah.  Ah, jeez.  Uh, the report remarks that the 57-year-old charter pilot suffered from severe coronary  artery disease and had just run about three miles to the airport from a hotel. 
[00:55:30]  The pilot had, um, his certificate, a bunch of hours and flight time.  Oh, might be a heart attack, are they saying?  Beach 18 type, oh, Beechcraft, you.  Uh, yeah, placed sole blame for the accident on the pilot error.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.  Due to downwind takeoff.  Oh.  Wait a minute, so Jim Croce was trying to save some money, found a pilot with severe...  With some severe...  Heart issues?  Yeah.  Who had to run from the hotel to the plane? 
[00:56:00]  Damn.  What the fuck?  Hit the only tree.  The only tree?  Oh, you can think of the songs we didn't hear because of a pecan tree.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  I hate pecans now.  I do, too.  Fuck pecans.  I never liked pecans.  Who likes pecans?  They stink.  I hate a pecan.  Oh, it stinks.  He died 30 feet in the air.  Yeah, right.  Embarrassing.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's not even impressive. 
[00:56:30]  Oh, that's terrible.  At least Roberto Clemente went down, like, you know, going to give some aid, or Otis Redding.  Did you have a plane crash, too?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Otis, of course.  The Big Bopper.  When they pull out those pies with the pecans on top.  It's like, shit.  No.  Roaches.  It really is.  Oh, they do look like roaches.  Horrible.  What year did the Big Bopper and...  Bop, bop, bop, banger, banger, banger.  Stunk.  I want to say 57.  I'm going to go 58. 
[00:57:00]  I thought it was like 55.  I'm going to go 56, actually, now.  I'm going to say in the 50s.  I'm going to go 59.  You got it.  Oh, is it that late?  I'm really good at this stuff.  Oh.  The video is the worst for this.  Don't we hate the Big Bopper?  Yeah, he sucks.  A chantilly lane.  The video's terrible.  Go to the video where he's picking up the phones and talking on them, and it's so obviously  lip syncing.  I got something on him.  So, he's really famous because he died.  Yeah, early. 
[00:57:30]  But if he was allowed to continue, you know he would have been considered a big-time fucking  hack.  A hack.  Oh, look at him.  Hello.  What?  Answering all the phones.  Oh, it's so...  No mic.  He's just talking to thin air.  Into the phone.  Nothing in the world.  Like a big-eyed girl that make me act so funny.  That mama, ooh.  Make me feel real loose like a long-necked goose.  A novelty song.  What I like.  Whoa.  What's that, baby?  Oh, he picks up the phone again.  Oh, we've done this break, but who cares? 
[00:58:00]  I know.  We always do.  What's up, baby?  Let's try to change the break a little bit.  Did he have another song?  Oh, no.  L-Rock, did he have another song?  Oh, baby.  There are other songs in here, but I don't think anything ever charted or got radio play.  You want to try another song by this guy?  Oh, please.  His fake guitar play.  Oh, this is horrendous.  He looks like a retard.  Lord.  I bet he was so into himself. 
[00:58:30]  Oh, they were loving it, too.  All these girls and guys are in, like, dresses and suits.  What I like.  Oh, he's back on the phone.  We heard you.  A Negro moved into our neighborhood.  Oh, baby.  He's helping someone's mother fix the floorboards.  Yeah.  Go bop him or something.  Oh, good.  Oh, all right, honey.  You know what I like. 
[00:59:00]  He heard you.  Chantilly lace and a pretty face.  You know what you like, plummeting.  You see how he fucked up picking up his guitar right there?  Yes.  I guess they just went with the one take, huh?  Chantilly lace and my horrified face.  Oh, it's terrible.  All right, give me another Big Bopper song.  And look at Dick Clark. 
[00:59:30]  That was Dick Clark.  What the fuck?  Wow, he was around even then, huh?  Yeah.  Jesus.  There's Beggar to a King, Big Bopper's Wedding.  Oh, come on.  Big Bopper's Wedding so far.  Big Bopper's Wedding so far.  What else we got, Tom?  Let's see.  It's the Truth, Ruth, Little Red Riding Hood, Walking Through My Dreams, and White Lightning.  It's the Truth, Ruth.  It's probably a fucking barn burner.  The Wedding one's pretty big.  Wedding or, yeah, it's the Truth, Ruth.  What was the Big Bopper one? 
[01:00:00]  Big Bopper's Wedding.  Big Bopper's Wedding.  Oh, right, right.  That sounds good.  Yeah, you want to do that one?  Okay.  Yeah, that sounds good.  Sounds the same.  Oh, baby.  And a man keeps saying, do you take this woman to be your awful-witted wife?  Oh, awful.  Get it?  And a start to think about her no more wicked.  That's the pretty little gals bobbing by.  This is the same thing.  Just twist it.  Make the world go round.  Ain't nothing in the world like a big-eyed girl. 
[01:00:30]  I make my acts so funny.  Make me spin my money.  I can't go low-paced.  I gotta look at your face for the rest of my life.  Oh, baby, that's what I like.  It's the same song.  What am I doing here in the first place?  Oh, no.  This is even the same.  Oh, making fun of marriage, I guess, huh?  Oh, thank God for wing-icing.  What's it, a big cake in the sky?  Yes. 
[01:01:00]  I think this is after he died.  They just took things he said and put them to this awful beat.  It's just a song parody.  It's all it is, really.  Making fun of marriage?  Give me another one.  What else we got left here?  Yeah.  What about that other one?  The Truth Root.  Truth Root.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's the Truth Root.  Said a little red rooster to the little red hen.  Man, I ain't been to rockin' since I don't know when.  This is the hand jive. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah, it's the hand jive.  Said a little red hen to the little red rooster.  Oh, yeah, Dad, you don't rock like you used to.  He just would talk, sing.  That's Truth, Ruth.  That's Truth, Ruth.  That's Truth, Ruth.  Everybody think I'm crazy, but you're doing my baby, baby.  That's Truth.  Was that a hottie?  Ruth.  This guy's name.  I so deserve to die.  Yuck.  All right, give me another one.  We're not feeling that one.  That's the Truth, Ruth.  The Truth, Ruth. 
[01:02:00]  I think it came right after she said, why did you call me a cunt?  That's the Truth, Ruth.  Why'd you call me a cold burner?  It's the Truth, Ruth.  We have Beggar to a King, Walking Through My Dreams, and White Lightning.  Walking Through My Dreams is probably a romantic one.  Yeah, let's try it.  Maybe he was trying to change his style a little bit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Let's try that one.  Christopher Reeve's song.  Now hush up, so I can go to sleep.  And dream about my baby. 
[01:02:30]  I close the line.  Damn, too, Lynn.  Sure.  Night comes.  Try to go to sleep.  But end of counting.  Sweet, sweet kisses.  I sit of counting.  She and she.  He walking through my dreams.  All through the night.  Walking through my dreams.  I shouldn't have taken that flight.  I shouldn't have taken the times of mine.  It's when I sleep, it seems.  So I'm right beside her when she walking through my dreams.  Listen to the plane screams.  This is terrible, horrible. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, God.  But boy, what a non-loss he was.  Yeah, we know he was a DJ.  He was a DJ back in the 50s.  So he's doing those, like, fucking Rick D shit for the time.  Yeah, yeah.  We have two left.  Do you want to try one?  Yes!  Oh, well.  I'm loving the big bopper hour here on the O.P.  Anthony program.  Yeah, let's see if any of them are any different.  All right.  This is White Lightning.  White Lightning.  I think I already know this one.  This might be his follow-up.  This is like his follow-up.  So easy to make songs like that. 
[01:03:30]  Terrible.  He seems very full of himself, too.  White Lightning. 
[01:04:00]  Oh, he was a DJ.  Was he?  Sorry.  All right.  That makes sense.  My Pappy.  Really?  Did you call him Pappy?  That's it for the big bopper.  You want to hear the last one?  All right.  We got one more.  Hey, there's only one more.  I know this is driving people nuts, and that's why, yes, I wanted to hear one more.  You think they're enjoying it?  Oh, fuck, no.  This one is Beggar to a King.  All right.  Wow.  You changed a beggar into a king. 
[01:04:30]  What's that frozen stuff on the wing?  I mean, it's a man who's the one who turned me down.  All right.  Nice. 
[01:05:00]  Well, you turned a beggar into a king.  Well, yeah.  She came into his life.  Yes.  Very good.  He was a beggar.  See?  But now he's a king.  Now he's a king.  I found one last one.  It was mislabeled, but I fixed it.  What's it called?  It's called Purple People Eater meets The Witch Doctor.  Oh, you know what?  Wait a minute.  Wait.  We know this, I think.  That's The Purple People Eater meets The Witch Doctor.  The Witch Doctor is another song.  Those are two songs.  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Oh, boy.  Are they his originals and then they were remade?  No.  No.  The Witch Doctor is David Saville. 
[01:05:30]  You're reading that.  Yes.  You didn't know that.  Yeah, I didn't know that.  Yeah.  A little song called Witch Doctor?  Did you actually know that?  Yes.  Why?  Because that led to a cartoon and everything else.  It was all based off that dumb song.  The Alvin and the Chipmunks, right?  What's that?  Okay.  All right.  Fair enough.  Doesn't miss one.  No, never.  Go ahead.  Of course.  Same fucking sound. 
[01:06:00]  I got real shook.  I heard the strangest sound.  I saw The Purple People Eater and my surprise.  The Witch Doctor sitting by his side.  The Witch Doctor had a little guitar in his hand.  Boo!  He's trying to do one of those things like that Halloween song.  Witch Doctor picked like Johnny B. Goode.  Is it this great?  Oh, a little chipmunk in there. 
[01:06:30]  What's that?  What's that?  Oh, and gee.  I got troubles.  That's so fucking sad.  Who fucking listened to this?  All right.  Enough.  God, please.  Oof.  What are we doing?  Oof.  It was terrible.  Oof.  You want to play a song from Today?  Why?  It's our music segment.  Oh.  Randy Newman.  Oh, right.  Stupid fucking Earl Douglas was tweeting about Randy Newman, and I couldn't help myself.  I had to beat him up a little bit. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, was he like loving this?  Randy Newman has been playing the same song for 30 years, and he just changes the lyrics.  This is a new one?  Is it I Love L.A., or is it fucking Short People?  Well, this one is called I'm Dreaming of a White President.  President.  He's getting political.  And of course, Earl likes it.  Earl, by the way, is one of the biggest-  He likes the worst music.  Earl is one of the biggest racists I've ever known.  Earl, everything is based on race with Earl.  Yeah. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  Is this a funny one, a parody?  I don't know.  I had no idea about this one.  Is it funny, or is it serious?  It's meant to be satirical.  Ah, very good.  Oh, satirical.  Yeah, political satire.  Oh, my God.  George Washington was a white man.  Adams and Jefferson.  What the hell is up with his voice?  It's wrong with his fucking mouth.  It sounds like he's fucking-  How about you swallow the buttermilk before you sink?  What is going on? 
[01:08:00]  Did he have a stroke?  Maybe we shouldn't make fun.  Thank you, thank you, Mr. Jesus.  Did he have a stroke?  I don't think so.  I don't know.  His mouth is extra mushy.  Hold on.  Hey, John Wesley Harding.  Oh.  I was scratching my back.  John Wesley.  That's funny.  George Washington was a white man. 
[01:08:30]  Washington.  It's a lot of spitting his mouth.  Adams and Jefferson, too.  Too.  Ed Lagan was a white man, probably.  And William McKinley, the whitest of them all.  Shot down by an immigrant in Buffalo.  What?  And a star fell out of heaven.  I'm dreaming of a white president. 
[01:09:00]  Just like the ones we've always had.  A real-life white man who knows the score.  How to handle money or start a war.  Wouldn't even have to tell me what we were fighting for.  Shut the fuck up.  Give me the right man.  Oh, this cocksucker.  He won everybody.  I think America's been pretty good to him. 
[01:09:30]  We get it.  I think America's been pretty good to you there, Randy Newman.  We get it.  White people are terrible, aren't they?  Ooh.  God.  We've had white presidents forever.  Look at the point we got up to.  Not too shabby.  Not too shabby with Whitey in charge.  Hey, this is supposed to be fun, man.  This is supposed to be fun.  Fucking A.  Tired of being shit on.  The white man.  I've never said that.  Oh, God.  He lost his mind, this Randy Newman.  Let's hear more.  This is funny.  I'm dreaming of a white president, someone whom we can understand, someone who knows where 
[01:10:00]  we're coming from, and that the law of the jungles, not the law of this land, deepest,  darkest Africa, 1903.  Little boy says, Daddy, I just discovered relativity. 
[01:10:30]  Big eclipse is coming.  Why, now prove it.  Wait and see.  You better eclipse yourself out of here, son.  Find yourself a tree.  There's a lion in the front yard, and he knows he won't catch me.  But how many little Albert Einsteins cut down while in their prime?  What?  Why did little Ronald Reagans gobbled up before their time?  I don't believe in evolution, but it does occur to me.  What if little William Howard Taft had to face a lion? 
[01:11:00]  Hey, why is his name Randy Newman when he's old?  Take us out the break, you fucking Odeeater.  This is the Odean Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Show me penis!  New to Sirius XM's fantasy football show, it's the Jim Florentine Show, putting the fun back in fantasy football. 
[01:11:30]  Nothing exciting about fantasy football.  It's fucking guys in khakis and button-downs watching football.  They bring their laptops to a fucking sports bar to come over.  Who just scored that touchdown?  I go, why? I got him on my team. Fuck you.  Go in the ladies' room and take a piss.  It's Jim Florentine, and your calls.  Talking everything fantasy football.  Hey, Jim, what's the best way to keep up with your team while the game is on?  Nobody watches fucking football with a laptop open. 
[01:12:00]  Nobody. You have a fucking case of beer and some sandwiches,  and you're talking about fucking getting a handjob from a stripper in the door in a commercial.  From the night before.  Hey, man. You know all your listeners love fantasy football?  All right, I don't give a shit. No fucking manly men play fantasy football.  We aren't even sure why we hired him.  Seems counterproductive.  And we're gonna open our fucking laptops and our iPads, and we're gonna have a draft.  Who are you gonna take?  How about taking any ass, you fucking homos?  Or your fucking fantasy football?  It's just nerdness. 
[01:12:30]  The Jim Florentine Show, on Sirius XM's fantasy football channel.  Go in the ladies' room and take a piss.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  I see Tony Serragoose outside the studio. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, let's go, Tony. What's up, man?  Sure, come on in.  What's the problem?  What the bug?  Come on in. Why not?  Sorry, Tony.  I'll tell you something. The guy that just picked me up. Are we on?  Yeah, we're on.  The guy that just picked me up, man. He smells like, uh...  Unbelievable. The big, fat kid?  Roland.  I love that kid.  Big fat kid.  Big fat kid.  Myself when I was back in the day.  Well, he must, like, take showers and Febreze or something, man. The guy smells delicious.  Oh, he actually smells good.  Like a candle.  He does. Yeah, really good.  He smells like a vanilla candle or something.  Yeah, Roland knows how to take care of himself. 
[01:13:30]  It was good. Let me tell you something.  You guys got some serious fans, man.  Oh, man.  Sorry about that.  Serious. What do you mean, sorry about that? I love it, man.  We were kind of bummed that you didn't come by last night.  Nah, listen.  And our fans kind of, like, they heard us.  We didn't say to do that, but they heard what we were saying and said, all right, we got to talk to this.  No, listen, man.  Listen, if I didn't have to go to Art Modell's funeral, I would have been right in here.  But I had to go shoot down to Baltimore.  Yeah.  It's not around the corner.  We knew it.  I love, let me tell you something.  I hope they're listening right now.  I love loyalty, man. 
[01:14:00]  They're loyal.  I mean, you know what?  Rip my ass.  I love it, man.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, give me some, you know.  I didn't know how this whole deal was set up here at Serious.  Like, you can go at one, and you walk down the street, and you can get Christian Radio.  I mean, you can go down there, and the guy's got, you know, he's got, like, cowboy boots on.  We call it the Radio Flea Market.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah.  The Radio Flea Market is a good definition.  Yeah, you just go around.  You need some socks.  You need a poster for the wall.  You need a little sports.  You go over there.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's unbelievable.  You need a little hip-hop.  Go across the hall. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  Yeah, but, like, seven death threats from your crew was great.  It was great.  They kind of scare us.  No, man.  They're tremendous, man.  I wish I had fans loyal like that.  Most of them are.  It's great.  It's great.  Literally tremendous.  Did you do NFL Radio this morning?  Yeah, yeah.  You know, I told two stories, and we've got to get out of there, because, you know, they're  real serious about sports and stuff, not like me.  Why don't they fool around a little bit?  Yeah, they got Tony Saragusa.  You fool around a little bit.  I mean, yeah.  You can get back to the stats in an hour.  Yeah.  We got Tony right now. 
[01:15:00]  No, we didn't really talk football at all.  I don't really, you know, football's great, but, you know, I don't really want to talk  about it all day.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Have you done Mike Francesa?  No, not Mike yet.  No.  Oh, Mike, he's a trip.  Yeah, Mike's good.  Make sure you're wide awake when you do his show, because he'll tire you out.  Yeah, he's very monotone.  No, no, no.  He's over the top.  Is he really?  On the radio, it sounds like.  Matt Dogg you're talking about, right?  No, no, no.  Oh, you went with Mike Francesa.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Yeah, you're right.  It's a great clip. 
[01:15:30]  Have you seen it?  Oh, it's fucking hilarious.  And he's denying that he fell asleep, which makes it even better.  He will not admit that he fell asleep for like 30 seconds.  Did he really?  Yeah.  It's a great clip.  He was getting a call in from, you know, one of those guys at the Yankee game somewhere,  Sweeney Murdy.  Right.  And you can see he just zonks out, which is funny, but he just doesn't know how to embrace  it.  He's denying it.  Yeah, you got to get one of your fans here to get him some crystal meth and pump him up.  I mean, come on, man, let's do it.  But the guy doesn't know how to laugh at himself, because he's really fucking pissed that, you  know, people are calling him out on it. 
[01:16:00]  Really?  The clips to your right a little bit, if you want to just see real fast.  Yeah, let's see.  He's out cold right there.  They have games to win.  Sweeney's talking.  They have the advantage of having one of the two teams.  Watch his head.  Watch his head.  He starts moving toward the ground.  Yeah, his head starts gone.  Yeah, he's going down, dude.  That's a guy that's sleeping, right, Tony?  Absolutely.  I hope he's sleeping.  I would go over and hit him with a paddle.  It looks like something's stopped.  His producer says something in his ear, apparently, and he wakes up.  The wake-up is the best.  You could tell he was asleep by the way he wakes up. 
[01:16:30]  Well, this guy he's talking to, Sweeney Murdy, that guy's probably putting him to sleep.  The mic's by his ear now.  It's going past his eye as his jowl is the only thing keeping him up.  His head is almost that afraid.  Oh, there he is.  Look at the eyes.  What happened?  What happened?  Where am I?  He has no idea where he is right there.  He's trying to figure it all out. 
[01:17:00]  No.  He goes, what'd I do?  He goes, what'd I do?  What happened?  What'd he say?  Did he ask me a question?  Oh, that's tremendous.  Sleep radio.  Change the name of the station.  Yeah, and Sweeney's used to that.  People just nodding off as he's babbling.  In your humble opinion, he was asleep, right?  What do you mean humble?  100%.  But the guy won't admit it.  Just admit it.  Let's go down there right now.  Let's go ask him.  Well, the best part, Tony, then the fans took it upon themselves, and they're now pranking  him with sleep jokes and shit. 
[01:17:30]  And that's making him even more mad.  It's a whole thing that we've been exploiting.  How was Art Modell's funeral and all that?  It was, you know, Ray Lewis got up and spoke, and a lot of people got up and spoke.  The place was packed.  It was really, it was a great ceremony.  Art Modell was a great guy.  I know, like, you know, I've been getting it last week, too, about, you know, him with  Cleveland.  Right, right.  You know, and all that kind of stuff.  And I'm like, well, listen.  It was a little rough how he left Cleveland.  Well, if you think about it.  To be fair.  Yeah, well, I played for, you know, both teams that moved. 
[01:18:00]  You know, the Colts, you know, if you look at the difference, okay, you know, Bob Irsay,  when he left Baltimore, took everything.  Took the logo, took the team name, you know, they went through the workout complex, and  they took the hot tubs.  I mean, they didn't leave the hinges on the doors.  It was unbelievable.  They just stripped everything.  Right.  And they left.  And, you know, they're just, you know, that was sort of like, left a bad taste, and I  think, in Baltimore's mouth about, you know, they're just leaving every, you know, taking  everything.  I mean, the Colts, the Baltimore Colts had what history they had, everything. 
[01:18:30]  And then you look at Art Modell, and Art Modell came forward, and he said, listen, I need  a stadium.  Now, he's not like, you know, he doesn't own Microsoft, or he doesn't own any other big  company, okay?  Football is pretty much his only deal.  So, business-wise, he had to go, and he said, listen, I need a new stadium.  And they just built a baseball stadium in Cleveland.  And, you know, he's like, I need a stadium.  I need a stadium.  We're going to build you a stadium.  And the mayor, you know, tell him all this stuff.  And this is what I'm reading.  I really don't know the true story, but this is what he's telling me. 
[01:19:00]  And he said, then they come out, and they tell him they're going to build a stadium,  and then they go, and they say, well, we're going to put it off for a couple years.  We're going to build the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  And that was sort of like a smack in the face.  Like, hey, listen, man, I got the Cleveland Browns.  This is a football stadium.  You know, I can't.  He just went and built a new facility for all, a training facility.  And he says, I can't survive.  I can't survive with what's going on here.  And he says, I've got to call your bluff and told the mayor, listen, he's leaving.  He's like, he ain't going to leave.  And he packed up, and he said exactly what he was going to do.  I just thought that, you know, I like guys that go and say they're going to do something 
[01:19:30]  and get it done.  We have too many guys in this country that go, and they tell us that they're going to do something  and never do it.  They don't want to set a nuts on them.  So, you know, Art Moldell had to look out for his family, a business decision.  But the one thing he did do, he gave them the indoor facility, the whole brand new facility  he just built.  Left that.  Left the Cleveland Browns name.  Left the logo.  Left everything that they had there.  All the tradition in Cleveland.  It says, when your mayor decides to build a stadium and you guys get a new team, you're  still going to be the Cleveland Browns.  And he says, I'm going to start over fresh in Baltimore.  But nobody ever talks about that. 
[01:20:00]  You know what I'm saying?  I think there's a big, you know, you want to talk about two different owners and two different  kind of guys.  Art Moldell, in my eyes, you know, he said he was going to do something and he didn't.  I love what you just said, and I look on the instant feedback, Michael in Cleveland.  Fuck Art Moldell.  Yeah.  I mean, what you just said seems pretty logical.  I mean, you know, listen, guys are going to go, and they're mad that they leave the  team.  I'm sure if, you know, if the Giants left New York or if, you know, with all the history  that they have there, people are going to be mad.  And I totally understand it.  I have nothing to do with Cleveland.  I was never in Cleveland. 
[01:20:30]  You know, I was in Indianapolis when Cleveland left.  So it was like, but I just look at it from the outside.  I mean, you know, you want to see what kind of guy the guy is?  That's what kind of guy Art Moldell was to me.  I mean, he would talk to us not only about football.  I mean, he'd talk to you about anything.  I mean, one story about Art Moldell that I have in my book is I'm having my third child  and my wife's pregnant and we have to go to training camp.  Now, you know, like my wife's ready to go like any time.  And I'm like, at training camp in Baltimore, she's here in New Jersey.  And I'm like, man, you know, I'm worrying about her. 
[01:21:00]  And he came up to me and he drove up in his golf cart and he goes, Goose, get in the  car.  I go, Hey, Art, how are you doing?  He goes, So your wife's having your third?  I'm like, Yeah, yeah.  And she's almost ready?  I'm like, Yeah.  He goes, Listen, I want you to concentrate on football and what you're doing.  Because if your head's not here, you're going to get hurt.  And I don't want that.  He goes, I chartered a helicopter and it's down at the airport.  It's going to stay there as long as we're in camp.  And as soon as your mother calls, as soon as your wife calls or your family member  calls, we have a car waiting.  We're going to take you right down there.  You're getting on a helicopter.  You're going to get back.  You're going to make sure you're there for your child's birth. 
[01:21:30]  I mean, to me, I'm like, Wow.  Now my question is this.  Did he get the helicopter ride?  You know what?  My wife lasted all the way until we broke camp and I wound up, it was on Hard Knocks.  My wife actually had the baby, my daughter Ava on Hard Knocks.  And we went all the way to the end of camp.  So the helicopter was there.  He must have paid for it to be there, but never had to use it.  That's rich right there.  Yeah.  Just having a helicopter waiting that you had to use.  Wow.  That's money.  How much is it to fly somewhere?  How much is it to just sit there for three weeks? 
[01:22:00]  To just sit there.  You know?  It was just a helicopter that doesn't work and he was just hoping that you'd make it.  Maybe.  I'll tell you what.  Maybe he didn't have any fuel in it, no engine.  But hey, he sold me.  I'll tell you that.  I must have been the biggest asshole ever.  That's funny.  How about Jerry?  I was always a cowboy.  I kind of stopped watching football for other sports, but I was a cowboy fan for many years.  And after, you know, from the mid-90s, Jerry Jones.  Cowboy like John Wayne or Dallas Cowboys?  Yeah, well, yeah, like John Wayne fan. 
[01:22:30]  He goes back to the Cowboys, this guy.  Jimmy loved the Cowboys for a long time.  Yeah, but childhood fan of them.  And I just stopped liking them with Jerry Jones.  It was like, it just annoyed me so much that he allowed Jimmy Johnson to walk and was over-managing.  What is it with these owners that are obsessed with being a part of the team and they can't just enjoy what it is they are?  Well, it's like this.  You know, all of a sudden you turn around and you're worth a billion dollars.  And all these guys on the field are getting all the attention.  And all of a sudden, you know, you want to get better looking.  You know what I'm saying?  So you want to win.  And I think, you know, guys don't get a billion dollars because they don't have egos. 
[01:23:00]  I mean, if you look around the league, right?  You don't get rich because, you know, you want to go.  So, you know, I think if we all wrote down, if I was to say, hey, listen, guys, all right, let's all write down what number we got to get to.  And then we just, like, say, all right, take care.  We're going to go on some island.  We're going to go drinking.  Let's go, you know, cruise around the world.  I mean, you know, it probably wouldn't be a billion.  It would probably, you know, like, you know, maybe 50 million would be nice.  You know, 50 million would be nice, right?  Even 30 million, right?  Nice.  Now, these guys get there and then they really don't have to worry about anything. 
[01:23:30]  But they just want more and more and more and more and more.  And it sort of, like, becomes an obsession and, you know, they want to go and, you know, they're the big guy in the ring.  And you've got 31 guys, you know, 32 guys out there.  And all of a sudden, you want to go and be the best of that group.  And, you know, you're fighting against guys like Paul Allen who could just, like, you know, buy your state and, like, you know, tell you to leave.  You know, and it's, I guess it's that kind of, like.  That's a game we'll never understand. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah.  You know, it's hard to comprehend.  It's money they'll never spend.  Yeah, you know, it's like none of them guys got to worry about, like, you know, where are we eating tonight?  You know, somebody already planned that about a month ago.  Obviously, it's really important to have a Super Bowl under your belt.  Yeah.  I mean, look at Dan Snyder.  I mean, he'll do anything to win a Super Bowl, you know.  And you win a Super Bowl not just for bragging rights because your team will be worth more money.  I mean, you know, at some point, you know, I don't know, that's not me.  If you read my book, that's not me.  It's called, by the way, let's promote it.  It's called Goose, the Outrageous Life and Times of a Football Guy. 
[01:24:30]  Right.  And this is just you're talking about when you played or what else is in the book?  No, it starts off when I was a young kid and goes all the way to now, me on the sideline and doing man caves on DIY Network.  So it's a whole, you know, long path.  I mean, pretty much when I was younger, you know, I was on a baseball team and I thought I was pretty good.  And my coach came to me and, you know, we're going to try out for the All-Stars and I didn't make the team.  And I thought I was pretty good.  And I walked all the way home crying and stuff like that. 
[01:25:00]  And the fire sort of started in my stomach and I was, like, pissed off.  And they called me back a week later to come back on the team.  And I wound up going, getting in the game.  You know, there was a couple guys on base.  I wound up hitting a home run and we wound up winning the game.  I become the MVP of the team and everything like that.  And that was sort of the start, like, of, you know, going a little bit and all of a sudden hitting a block, you know, a little bit of adversity.  And then how do you get through that?  And I coach little kids.  I coach my son in football.  So I try to pass on a lot of the information, the things that have happened to me because I think life is completely different now. 
[01:25:30]  I think kids, you know, their parents are going to, like, job interviews with them.  Like, it's completely different now than it was when I grew up.  And I think if we don't tell people about how we grew up and the different things that happened, that they just think, like, this is normal, you know.  I think they're all playing at PlayStation, you know, and we.  And if they're losing the game, they go up and they hit the reset button.  Well, in life, there's no reset button.  You know, you're going to have a jerk off that's going to be right in front of you and he's your boss.  And you're going to have to deal with him and then hopefully get good enough that he gets fired or you can move on, you know. 
[01:26:00]  So you don't like how sports is run, right?  We talk about it on our show a lot where they don't keep score.  Everyone has to play.  The mercy of.  Well, I just think, you know, I can't stand, you know, this trophy, participation trophy.  Everyone gets a trophy?  I mean, what is this?  I went home crying because we didn't get trophies when I was playing basketball.  But it made me try harder.  Oh, I'm on the board and I'm like, you know, we've got to cut these trophies out for these kids.  No, it's a participation.  I'm like, listen, people.  No, it's stupid.  First of all, I wish it was like that, that every guy that got to the NFL got a ring that says, you know, you're a world champion. 
[01:26:30]  But it just doesn't happen.  You know what I'm saying?  You kill yourself to get that.  You're setting them up for some tough days.  How about the guys who put in the extra time?  How about the guys that go and do all the extra stuff?  You know, don't go on vacation.  They stay home.  They work hard.  They go to camps in the summer, right?  Yeah, they go to camps.  They do all the extra stuff.  They win the championship.  And it doesn't really matter because the guy who didn't do nothing, he gets a trophy too.  Yeah.  Like, you're sort of minimizing, you know, the championship of the league. 
[01:27:00]  Like, that should mean something.  Hard work and competition, it's down the shit of these days.  It's unbelievable.  In my house, no.  Listen, if you get a participation trophy, it doesn't come in now.  Get out of here.  My brother, my nephew plays football.  He's pretty good too.  And I went out to see a game.  He was maybe 10 at the time.  And they were kicking ass.  And all of a sudden, the whole team is off the field and they put in the scrubs.  I'm like, Scott, what the hell's going on?  He goes, oh, when you're up by 30 points, you're not allowed to play offense anymore. 
[01:27:30]  Well, I agree with that.  You know, at some point.  Yeah, because I think, you know.  But then those guys are going to, like, kind of hold back and not run up to score.  Yeah, but.  I learned some serious life lessons when I got home after a big fucking beating.  Ass whooping.  Yeah.  In sports.  Yeah, but I think that you've got to understand, you know, I think people have to go and kids  have to have a little bit of confidence.  Yeah.  And I think if you.  Isn't that up to the coach, though, you think?  Well, I think, you know, running up a score.  I mean, what's the difference if you win by 30, if you win by 90? 
[01:28:00]  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, you still won.  But it's just weird, because in this case, maybe I didn't explain, then they would not  play defense, let the other team score, so then they could get their guys back in.  No, I understand taking the starters out.  It just fucks up the whole game.  No, you've got to play the game still the same way.  But I understand taking the starters out and putting, like, the kids who, you know, maybe  don't play as much.  This was more than that, is what I'm saying.  I mean, listen, some of the rules they have.  Because even when we were growing up, if the score was being run up, you know, yeah, you  did take out your guys.  Whatever happened to, like, going and you have a beef with a guy, and you go and say, all 
[01:28:30]  right, man, meet me outside, or meet me in the parking lot, and you guys pound it out.  One guy wins, one guy loses, and then you clean yourself up, and you go home.  I bet you won a lot.  Yeah.  It's easy for you to say.  Let me tell you something.  I was younger.  It's easy for Tony to say.  You know, we go out, I kick his ass, and then we win.  It's cool.  It's like, you know, now you've got to, like, call your attorneys.  All right, listen, they're going to fight at nine.  Make sure someone films it, puts it on YouTube, and, you know, it's unbelievable.  Tony, this is a good time for Anthony to tell his football fighting story.  All right, let's hear it.  Of course. 
[01:29:00]  I was, it had to be fifth grade, East Islip, Long Island, New York.  A lot of good football on Long Island.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, trust me, you're going to find that out in a minute or two.  Well, there was the jock, one of the guys that really, the gym teacher's, you know, pet kind of guy,  and he was good at every sport.  That was me.  But his name.  Making fun of me?  Of course.  No, yeah, yeah.  I'm only kidding, I'm only kidding.  But he didn't have the most masculine of names.  His name was Norman, so I would call him Norman, and he would beat the shit out of anybody, 
[01:29:30]  so I saw him around a corner.  His name was Norman, and he beat everybody up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That should be illegal.  I know.  That should be illegal.  Well, I peeked around a corner.  And I was like, hey, Norman.  And one of his friends saw me and told him, and he goes, well, after school, I'm going to kick the shit out of you.  Just like you just said, Tom.  So I'm like, oh, man, I'm just a fucking string bean of a kid, and he's, you know, that, and so we square off,  and I throw a punch.  I hit him square on the forehead and break the ulna and radius, both bones in my forearm, 
[01:30:00]  just fractured from punching him in his hard head.  Did he hit you?  With a right.  That was a right?  Then he hit me, and I, yeah, I was done.  That was it.  I spent the next eight weeks in a cast.  Listen, dude, you got to shout it, bro.  I got to shout it.  Wait to hear the punchline.  Well, if you know, the guy didn't like the name Norman.  He went on to play football and stuff under the name, of course, Boomer.  That's what Boomer Siason.  He broke his head.  I broke my hand, punching Boomer in his big fucking Nazi-looking blonde head, and he beat the shit out of me. 
[01:30:30]  And to this day, he enjoys the fact that he knows.  Oh, he talks about it all the time.  Yeah, we've talked to him.  I'm going to have to ask him about this.  He'll know.  He'll know.  So he was a bully.  So Boomer the bully.  Boomer used to go through the cafeteria and just grab kids' heads and put it by his ass and fart and just laugh.  He was Biff Tannen.  He was fucking Biff Tannen from Back to the Future. 
[01:31:00]  What are you looking at, butthead?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  And I knew I didn't have a shot in hell.  I will never call him Boomer again.  Please call him Norman.  I will call him Norman from now on.  See, you could probably get away with it.  Yeah.  As a matter of fact, I got some gas brewing.  I might put his face down there in my ass and blow one out.  How's that?  Yeah, let him know.  Yeah, for back in the day.  All right?  This is from Anthony.  That's for Anthony.  Slow Italian revenge.  What can you tell me about my Jets? 
[01:31:30]  Give me some hope.  The Jets.  What do you got on the Jets?  The Jets are going to be okay.  They're going to be all right.  You think?  Yeah.  Sanchez looks shitty against the Steelers.  You know what?  Yeah, but I think that if you look at week one, you probably thought you were going to the Super  Bowl, right?  I'm happy.  I mean, you know, it's almost like a heartbeat.  You were real high, and now you're real low.  You know, I think every team is going to, you know, have highs and lows, especially early  in the season.  But, you know, I think if they stay healthy, things will be okay.  You know, can I say, you know, they're going to go to the playoffs?  I can't say that.  I mean, you know, but you'd be like a moron if you did say that. 
[01:32:00]  You know what I'm saying?  You have to think that.  Yeah, but could I say the Giants are going to go to the playoffs?  I can't say that right now.  I mean, they didn't look that great against Dallas.  No.  You know, so it's like, you know, let's see in week four or five what's going on.  But, you know, everyone's so hard on their teams right now.  They want to kill each other.  Like, it's crazy.  But I think that, you know, bringing Tebow in, I thought that's a positive for the team.  Why not?  You know what I'm saying?  I think Sanchez, when he came in, you know, was like the golden boy. 
[01:32:30]  You know, you bring him in there.  You gave him everything.  He had no one sniffing up his butt.  I mean, you know, I don't want to say anything.  But, you know, now all of a sudden you bring Sanchez in and he pushes him a little bit more.  And, you know, if he doesn't do good, Tebow's going to get in.  So, you know, you need that.  You know, you need guys, you know, that you're competing against.  I mean, you guys are competing every day, right?  For time.  No, not anymore.  You guys solidified the market, right?  You guys cornered it.  You guys cornered it. 
[01:33:00]  We don't have to compete.  Oh, yeah.  We kind of ruined radio.  So we got rid of all our competition by ruining the entire medium.  Right.  There's no one left, I swear.  No shock jockery going on anymore.  I don't even know who we would compete against at this point.  But if you're reading the book, there's one story that I wanted to bring up now that you talked about.  Norman, you know, the book goes from, you know, that early time, me losing my father when I was 21 and sort of that whole thing. 
[01:33:30]  And then, you know, going through college and blowing both my knees out in college and not getting drafted in the NFL with 12 rounds.  And then stories that happened to me in football.  And, you know, there's stories like, you know, we were playing the Washington Redskins and being in Baltimore.  You know, the stadium's like between the two cities.  So we stayed in Baltimore.  You know, so we're at our hotel.  You know, we had a training table at night.  So I wake up in the middle of the night and my stomach's absolutely killing me.  I mean, I'm like, like, I never really had, like, you know, stomach ache, you know, the little stomach. 
[01:34:00]  But I'm talking like I can't even touch it.  Like, it's that bad.  So it's probably four or five hours before the game.  So I tell the trainer, they get the doctor and they bring me down to the stadium and they take an x-ray.  And they said, listen, you're constipated, man.  Your whole intestinal tract is full.  Oh, man.  So I'm like, this is like four hours before the game.  I'm like, you know, what do we do here?  What's my option?  So he says, well, we can give you a laxative.  I'm like, laxative four hours before a game.  That shit really doesn't sound too good for me.  What's option B?  They said, well, we can give you an enema and hopefully, you know, release some of it and give you a little bit of relief. 
[01:34:30]  So I'm like, all right, you know, let's do the enema.  So now I'm thinking, you know, they're going to have a nice enema, you know, like from CVS, a nice real enema, you know, like a red one, you know, with a nice hose, different sprays at the end, you know, like something comfortable.  No, they don't have this.  They get a saline bag and they sort of like, they're looking around and they really can't find like a hose to hook to the saline bag.  So I guess one guy's must have had it in a car, used as a siphon, like stealing gas or something. 
[01:35:00]  So they come down, they hook this hose up.  Now I'm looking at this hose and it's really not the diameter that I'm really, you know, thinking like this is an enema hose.  No, this is looking more like a garden hose.  Okay.  So they get the doctor and the doctor comes over, walks over into the, you know, the little stalls there.  And, you know, the only guy that's there is our kicker, Matt Stover.  And he's there and he's like, you know, and he knows what's going on.  He's like, you know, just when it goes in, just I'm like, shut the fuck up.  Don't talk to me.  I'm sticking a hose in my ass.  It's the last thing I want to do is have a kicker telling me what I got to do.  Just shut your mouth. 
[01:35:30]  Okay.  So I go and the doctor comes in and he gets gloves on.  I'm like, listen, dude, you're not shoving a hose on my ass.  I'm going to do this myself.  Just give me the hose.  I get some Vaseline.  I put it on.  I slowly like slide it in.  Right.  So he gets the bag.  It's in and he like starts squeezing the bag.  And I'm like, oh, you know, the pressure was like tremendous.  So I go, I like, I'm like, pull the hose out.  I'm like sitting there.  I'm like, man.  Matched over once again.  Just hold on as long.  Shut your mouth.  I'll kill you and your family.  Shut your mouth.  I'm just sitting there.  And I go, I sit on the toilet. 
[01:36:00]  I'm like, I can't hold it anymore.  I sit on the toilet and, you know, like all this pressure is released.  And I look in, I'm like, oh, that felt good.  And I look in the toilet and it's like spring water.  There's nothing.  Oh, man.  Not a raisin.  Not a, you know, not like a gerbil ran by and quickly dropped like a little.  Nothing.  I'm like.  So I go to my, you know, that was like three hours, you know, before the game.  So I go to my trainer.  I go, listen, we just took the enema, you know, because, well, that's salt water.  You know, it's going to loosen things out.  I'm like, nothing happened here, dude.  My stomach's still bothering me.  I didn't put enough in. 
[01:36:30]  And the doctor goes, I'm like, oh, you didn't put enough in.  So they go and they make another one.  So now I'm pissed.  Now the players are starting to come and the coaches, everyone's starting to get ready.  So I go in, put the hose back in there.  And he squeezes like half the bag in.  And I'm like, oh, son of a bitch.  This is not good.  You know, so I'm sitting, I'm trying to hold it.  Matt Stover once again, you know, trying to hold it a little longer.  I'm like, I'm going to kill everybody in your neighborhood.  Just shut your mouth, dude.  Okay.  So I go and I sit back down and all that water shoots out of my ass.  And I'm like, oh, I look in the toilet and it's like, maybe, maybe the size of like a peanut, you know, maybe a peanut. 
[01:37:00]  And I'm like, what the, I'm like, how could nothing come out?  Like, what is going on here?  So now I'm pissed.  I get a towel.  I wipe myself up, everything like that.  I walk over, I got my jock strap on and I walk over the train.  I said, this is bullshit, man.  You made me take two animals, this and that.  So now the coaches come up because you've got to deactivate players before the game.  You bring like 50 and then they, they go down, you know, a lower number.  And I go, you know, this is not, no, this is not working.  I'm like, he's like, there's nothing else I can tell you. 
[01:37:30]  So the coach is going, listen, coach, you're going to play?  We need you.  Like, you got to, I'm like, yeah, I'm going to play.  I'm going to play.  So I get a painkiller.  I chew a painkiller up.  I'm like, God damn, this is unbelievable.  So the coach tells me, you know, I told him I'm going to play.  So I look over and the, and the, and the, the, the offensive linemen have their shoulder pads,  like on a chair and they're all putting carpet tape on the shoulder pads because then you  put your Jersey on.  So guys can't grab your Jersey.  It won't pull away from your, you know, from the carpet tape.  So I said, oh, that's, that's an idea of mine.  So I get like three or four strands of carpet tape. 
[01:38:00]  I stick them together.  I like squat down and I put them between my ass cheeks and I tape my ass cheeks together.  Right.  So I'm like, man, I gotta, I gotta stop this shit from coming out.  You know what I'm saying?  So I got my ass cheeks all taped up.  Now I walk over to my locker.  I look in the locker and I'm like, you gotta be shitting me.  We're, you know, we have a lot of different uniforms that particular day.  You know, we're wearing a white Jersey and white pants.  So now I'm like, this is bullshit.  Right.  So I walk over to trainer.  I get my pants on.  I'm like, I can't even pull my belt tight.  I go, listen, dude, if at any time, at any point you see me laying on the field on my 
[01:38:30]  back, don't you frigging dare turn me over.  You get a stretcher.  You put me on the stretcher.  You get me off the field.  You get me a fresh pair of pants, some powder so I can clean myself up a little bit and then  get me back out.  But, you know, this could be the most embarrassing day of my life.  If you turn me over and I have a big ass brown spot.  I'm playing on turf, too.  It's not like, you know.  So, yeah, I mean, being terrified about shitting your pants on national television in an NFL  game is something that I think, you know, everybody should experience. 
[01:39:00]  What happened?  Let me tell you something.  Afterwards, nothing ever came out, okay?  Luckily.  The tape worked pretty good.  But, you know, being Italian, I got some hair down there.  That shit wasn't happy coming off.  I'll tell you that.  You got off to just go one, two, three?  Yeah.  One, two, three?  Oh, yeah.  One, two, three.  But only, like, two pieces came out.  I still had another one, like, real close to the sphinct.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, it was...  So, anyway, we go in.  Afterwards, I go in.  I just sit on the toilet.  And, man, the toilet flushed by itself.  I didn't even have to flush. 
[01:39:30]  You know, did you ever have that happen?  No.  I mean, it just goes...  Yeah, with one of the automatic ones.  Was somebody in here in a stall with me and, like, hit the lever?  Right.  Nothing, you know.  And I sat on the toilet for so long that...  I don't know if you guys ever experienced this.  My legs went numb.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, like, when you're, like, reading Playboy or something like that, probably, Anthony?  Call it newborn fawn.  Yeah, yeah.  When you stand up and you're all...  Yeah, like someone hits your legs with novocaine.  And you're like...  You know, it's all...  You know, like there's ants running all over your legs and stuff.  And the team left.  I had to take a cab back because I was on the toilet for, like, probably an hour 45. 
[01:40:00]  Jeez.  Yeah, but I met some guys in the parking lot, tailgated, drank some beers, and I got back  home.  It was good.  It's got to be pretty cool.  You're obviously a good storyteller.  No.  No, I really struggle.  Did you do anything in theater or any of that shit?  I did 25th Hour with Spike Lee.  I was in that movie.  Yeah, I did...  You know, in high school, I was, like, in the plays and stuff, but it's...  You know, I've done a lot of radio.  A lot of radio.  When I was in Indianapolis, I had, like, three or four shows there, and, you know, we would  go, and it was pretty funny.  So, there was 98 Rock or something like that, and this guy was like, I'm like, listen, I 
[01:40:30]  want...  The Bird.  Yeah, something, whatever it was, in Indianapolis, and he's like, listen, I got a time slot  to, you know...  And it was, like, the worst slot ever.  Like, no one listens, right?  So, I had a roommate of mine from Boston, Eddie Toner, who's a funny bastard, man, and  he was playing fullback, and so I'm like, come on, Ed, we'll go, you know, we'll go on  the radio, we'll fill an hour, then after that, we'll go, we'll promote, like, a Monday  night football show.  I'll cut a deal.  I cut a deal with some place, some sports bar, and we'll shoot up over there.  Nice.  Well, you know, we get on, and now we're one in 15 that year, and I got people calling 
[01:41:00]  me, and they're like, you know, we saw you guys all looking at the cheerleaders' asses,  you guys don't want to fucking play nobody, you know, like, they're ripping us, right?  So, now I says, you know what, this is an opportunity to get back at some of the guys.  So, we had a general manager, Bob Turpin, and he was a pain in the ass, you know?  But Eddie couldn't stand the guy, hated him, you know?  And they would never, like, play Eddie, like, he would play, like, you know, sporadically.  So, Eddie would go, like, in the other room, and I would like, all right, we're going to  take a caller tonight, and I'd go, and Eddie would disguise his voice. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, this is Joe from Smithville, and, you know, what's up with that fat bastard, Bob  Turpin, the shit's just piling over his belt.  He's got to play that one guy, that fullback that no one knows, you know, Eddie Toner,  that guy's unbelievable.  He's a jerk-off, you know, and we'd have to beep him out, you know?  And we would just rip the guys, you know?  So, no one in the complex would bother us.  Now, this came, we were, like, the number one show in the area.  Like, people would call in, the calls would be astronomical, you know?  Listen, don't, you know, they would say, hey, this girl has a chlamydia, don't, you 
[01:42:00]  know, don't date this cheerleader.  You know, there would be all kinds, like, sort of your kind of shit, you know what I'm  saying?  And so we built that up, and then we went to the radio show, and then Bob and Tom  station, you know, another radio station, they're, like, more mellow, you know, took  us on.  I went on that show, and then when I went to Baltimore, I had my own show also, like, on a  Monday night.  And we actually did it in a live venue, and I actually told the story about me almost  taking a shit, like, in front of, you know, like, 2,000, you know, 1,500, 2,000 people,  and it was...  They must have loved it.  Yeah, it was great.  You know, because, listen, these are things that happen. 
[01:42:30]  Yep.  And that's what the book's like, you know?  I don't really hold, you know, hold back.  And these are experiences that happened to me, and, you know, there's some coaches that I  couldn't stand, you know, guys that I, you know, I stayed in there, you know?  We, you know, in college, had a kind of guys that weren't, you know, they were just phony  balonies, you know what I'm saying?  And I...  You call them out on it.  I call them out a little bit.  You know, I'm still in the...  You know, I don't really, like, you know, like, try to make myself look good by calling  other guys out.  I'm not that kind of guy, but, you know...  You just set the record straight. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, just put it out there.  Did you want to retire, or was it, like, your body told you you had to, or were you like,  ah, I'm done?  You know, when you play in the NFL, you come in, and you're like, you know, you're  cocked wrong, like, when you first get there.  You know, you go, you're a little sore on Monday, but, you know, there's, you know,  by Tuesday, you're fine, you know?  And then, like, three or four years in the league, you know, Tuesday, you're still sore  a little bit, you know?  And then Wednesday, it's like, you know, you get eight years in the league Wednesday, then  third...  Then all of a sudden, you come to a point where you're not really recovering.  Like, you know, like, I'm sort of like people who've been in car accidents, and you get, 
[01:43:30]  like, that soreness.  I mean, you're, like, that sore all week, and it's like, you know, you can't really practice  and all this other...  And it gets to a point where, like, you're like, man, I just, I'm still sore on Saturday.  Like, this isn't...  Oh, wow.  You know, and, you know, playing 12 years, and I was a nose guard, and played, you know,  got, you know, every day, you pound and pound and pound.  It just got to the point where I knew I was done, and, you know, my kids were getting  older, and I wanted to throw my son a baseball.  I didn't want to, you know, somebody else teaching him how to throw a baseball or throw a football.  So it was important to me to, like, you know, like we said earlier in the show, you 
[01:44:00]  know, I wrote down a number, you know, I'm happy where I'm at.  Yeah, could I have made more money?  Yeah, but, you know, health and money, I'll take health, you know what I'm saying?  Was it depressing, though?  Because I'm always amazed, like, for athletes, what you first do, because it's such a high-profile  life, and then all of a sudden, you just kind of just go away.  Well, I think when you talk about football, it is a lot different than every other sport,  because it's, you go and you say, okay, I'm done.  That's it.  We're not going to play anymore.  And you never put a helmet on again. 
[01:44:30]  Like, you put a helmet on every day, or shoulder pads, or something.  You know, that's your uniform.  That's like, you guys come, and it's almost like you guys go in and say, hey, listen,  okay, radio is, I'm done doing radio.  And you could never come back to it.  Like, you could come back to radio.  Like, if you take a couple years off and want to start radio again, you could always come  back.  But football, you never are able to come back to that sport.  You know, I never thought of that, because when other athletes retire from other sports,  they could kind of still play the sport.  Play some golf, play a little basketball.  But you could also play baseball if you wanted.  Yeah, play softball if you're a baseball player, right?  Well, Jordan was playing basketball, pick-up games and shit, but I never thought about 
[01:45:00]  that.  Football guys, why would you ever put on another helmet if you were retiring?  Absolutely.  And especially defense.  Right.  You know, offensively, if you were like a receiver or a quarterback, you can go out  and throw the ball a little bit.  Yeah, right, right.  You need offensive guys out there in order to play defense.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't practice defense without an offense.  Like, it's like, you know, so...  You've been out of the league a while now, right?  Yeah, like 10, 11 years.  10 or 11 years, I was going to say.  Yeah, what was pretty crazy is, you know, my son, he said...  You look like a young guy, though.  I am young.  I'm young.  I'm 45.  So you retired at 35, 34? 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  How the fuck do you do that?  Most people don't even know what the fuck they want to do at 34.  Yeah, 16 knee operations.  It was, you know, it was pretty beat up, man.  Pretty beat up.  Hey, do you feel like the football players, because the one...  Who was the player that, I think he had all these concussions and he shot himself, but  he said he left his brain because he wanted them to study it?  Yeah, junior stay out.  Do you think that the NFL, did they take care of guys, right?  Or was he maybe just had some other stuff going on?  Well, there's a lot of lawsuits going on right now with the concussions and how  the NFL is taking care of guys, but that was a tragic thing. 
[01:46:00]  I mean, junior was a great guy.  It was just...  No one could really...  You know, all the players were, like, mesmerized if you knew just, you know, why he would do  something like that.  And it wasn't...  I don't know.  It just wasn't...  Wasn't there another player who did it, too, not long ago?  I want to say it wasn't...  I know junior was more recent, but there was a guy a couple of years ago.  I don't remember what his name was, but he was the one who I thought purposefully shot  himself in the heart.  No, that was junior stay out.  Oh, it was junior.  Yeah, yeah.  Because everyone was wondering if you want to commit suicide and shoot yourself in the 
[01:46:30]  head.  Right.  And he just shot himself and people were, you know, coming out saying, oh, it's because  he wanted to get his brain studied for the concussions and this and that.  But, you know, a lot of problems with the concussions, but you know what?  I think technology has gotten better.  You know, you don't see as many concussions.  I mean, I'll tell you something.  The NFL, the speed of the NFL is ridiculous.  Like, if you're ever on the field...  It's horrifying.  It's so fast.  When you're lucky enough to sit, you know, close to the action, it's horrifying.  It is. 
[01:47:00]  It is.  You guys are running full speed at each other.  The collisions are, like, ridiculous.  Ridiculous.  And you know what?  And coaching young kids, I get so many parents and all of a sudden they're  your son, you know, gets a little headache or, oh, he's got a concussion.  No, he doesn't have a concussion.  Everybody wants to say they have a concussion.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Kids are not moving as fast as they move in professional sports.  But, you know, not to say that you need to take all the precautions for it, but, you  know, I think it's really hurting the sport because, you know, are the numbers.  My brother's down at Tom's River, my brother Elio, and he, you know, he coaches down there 
[01:47:30]  and he sees the numbers getting lower.  My brother Pete is in Kenneworth and he sees his numbers getting lower.  So we're always talking and it's, really, the game of football is changing really, really  rapidly.  And it's, the NFL has got to go and take, you know, those younger kids and try to gain  some confidence back in the parents so they, you know, send their kids out there to play  the game.  Who put the most brutal hit on you that you've ever taken?  Who would you say was the guy you just dreaded having a face?  Who was the fullback of Tennessee? 
[01:48:00]  Nick, you remember?  Lorenzo Neal?  Yeah, Lorenzo Neal.  That's my guy.  He knows everything because short-term memory lost all the concussions.  Lorenzo Neal actually, against the Tennessee Titans in the first quarter, I went down  and had my head down and I actually got paralyzed from the neck down.  Yeah.  And I felt like there was somebody on top of me and I kept screaming, Bill Tessendorf was  our trainer.  I'm like, get off me, Tess.  You know, somebody's on me, somebody.  And everyone's going, no, no one's on you, dude.  No one's on you.  And this is like a couple weeks after, you know, that shit story I told you and I'm 
[01:48:30]  laying there and they had to come out with a stretcher and they rolled me over and they  put a neck brace on.  It was like the scariest thing that ever happened to me in my life.  Like, I don't really get scared about anything.  I've had guns in my mouth.  I've had, you know, a lot of things happen to me that really didn't bother me.  Like, listen, dude, it's going to be quick.  If he's going to shoot you, it's going to be quick.  But being paralyzed and having someone wipe your ass for the rest of your life, I mean, that's  something that bothers me.  Especially an active guy.  Yeah.  You know, so I'm laying there and I came in and, you know, my mom wasn't there. 
[01:49:00]  And I always would, you know, as long as I played the game, it would always be like,  I'd have to raise my hand for my mother to go and say, hey, listen, he's all right.  You know, because I was worried about your mom.  You know, your mom, you only got one mom.  So, and so my brothers were there and they came down to the field and the field is completely  silent.  The name of 70,000 people, 60,000, whatever it is.  And I go off and I'm, and it felt like, you know, like when you hit your funny bone and like  everything, that's how I was from the neck down.  Holy shit.  So it was like, man, this is not good.  This is not good.  You know, and I'm like almost like crying up and I'm like on the back, they get me in  the stretch and they're taking me in the tunnel. 
[01:49:30]  And, um, I told you I was telling that, that, uh, radio story.  And as I'm going in the tunnel and one of the guys yells out, he goes, uh, he ain't hurt.  He just shit his pants, you know?  And I wanted to give the guy the finger, but they get me inside and they start cutting like  they want to cut my pants off.  I'm like, oh, don't cut my pants off.  Cause I'm now I'm just starting to move my hands a little bit.  Like, I got, I'm like, you're so focused in on the game and your adrenaline's going  so much.  Now I got to start focusing on like, I got to move my hands, dude.  I got to walk.  I got kids, man.  And I'm, and I'm starting to move.  And he's like, listen, you know, and I sit up and I'm just starting to move. 
[01:50:00]  My brothers are like, don't get up.  Don't get up.  I'm like, I'm going to be all right.  I'm going to be all right.  I'm like, uh, I got to go back out.  Are you out of your mind?  You're not going back out.  The doctor's like, there's no way.  I'm like, listen, what do I have to do to go back out?  I'm like, they're like, you got to go get an MRI.  I'm like, well, fire up an ambulance.  They're back in ambulance down the, down the, the tunnel.  And, um, well, they're getting me a couple of police escorts and we shoot over to the  hospital and, uh, you know, getting an MRI is not really designed for guys my size.  Like, you know, aunt you string being, you would slide right in, you know what I'm saying? 
[01:50:30]  Like a nice, you know, it's a, but me, I'm like, you know, so I had to put my hands  over my shoulders.  So I went in there, I got an MRI.  They got me out and they said my spinal cord actually hit the side of the, the one, you  know, the spine.  And it was like, almost like an actual, the guy said it almost like, you know, you're funny  bone.  Like, you know, you hit your nerve and I was really weak from the, from the neck down.  And I'm like, all right, listen, I got to go back.  So I went back to the doctor's night and they cleared me like me about like eight plays before  the first half. 
[01:51:00]  I don't know how I did it.  I got my stuff back on and I ran out of the tunnel and I, and I told the coach I had to  go back in.  Cause I told him if I don't go back in, I'll never play this game again.  That was the year we won.  Oh, is that the reason?  Cause I was going to ask you that.  Yeah.  It was, uh, you had, I was so scared, you know, that I, if I didn't go back in, I know I would  have, I would have said, Hey, listen, I've had enough.  If you had time to think about it, it would have got you.  Yeah.  But I went back in and it was probably the worst game I ever played because I had no, no strength.  You know, like you have to hit your funny bone.  You have like no strength.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like weight.  Like rubber.  And I'm like trying to like, you know, playing against Bruce Matthews and I'm trying to lock 
[01:51:30]  him out and make plays and you know, they could put me in and out just to get my confidence  back.  But it was, it was a, it wasn't a great game for me, but, uh, I still had the confidence  of, of, of playing back.  Like I can, I can get back to some scary shit.  They're telling us we have to wrap Tony cause he has other press.  I guess they, they're Iraq is saying no, no, no, you got live TV with Boomer.  Oh yeah.  Oh, is that what you're doing?  Boomer.  Let's plug the book real quick because it's called a goose.  The outrageous life and times of a football guy.  Uh, Tony, sir. 
[01:52:00]  Goose.  So you're really an entertaining guy, man.  Thanks man.  I'm so glad we worked it out for real.  Yeah.  I'm happy.  We'll tell the listeners to leave you alone.  Sorry about that.  Uh, you know, no, listen, tell them guys are calm.  You're all jerk offs.  All right.  I want to hear the gun in the mouth story next time you come back.  Yeah, definitely.  I'd love to come back, man.  Definitely.  I'm around.  Yeah.  You guys are cool.  Tell Boomer I want a rematch.  All right.  Norton, right?  Norton.  Norman.  Norman.  Yeah.  Norman.  Norman.  Okay.  All right.  I'll see you guys later, man.  Thanks a lot.  I appreciate it.  Tony Saragusa, everyone.

[01:54:30]  866-FU. line 1.  That's 866-FU.  Line 1.  Serious XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Really liked Tony Saragusa.  Yes.  I want to thank the fans in me that happened. 
[01:55:00]  We were kind of bummed that we felt like we, I don't know, we felt like we got blown off  at the time and then he actually explained himself because the listeners reached out and  then he comes in.  He says, hey man, I'll come in.  Yeah, of course I will.  And he did.  And he was fun to listen to.  He's a very entertaining guy.  Yeah.  Like he's just, he's one of those big Italian guys who just dominates a room.  Like we all like, were you in LA with me when, or with one of you guys there when we, there  was that big Italian guy from New York in the pool at the. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, I think I was there.  That maybe it was you and a big guy just entertaining everybody.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was like the big loud Italian that only.  Just work in the room.  Or the pool area.  People love those guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They love those guys because there's no one like that out there.  A couple of things after the interview.  We were all taking pictures, obviously.  Sure.  I took a picture of Tony and his books, you know, get some, some Instagramming going and  I checked my picture and I got photobombed by Chip.  It's hilarious.  Oh yeah.  I was out. 
[01:56:00]  It's one of, it's one of my better photobombs.  It's so fucking good.  It's a really good photobomb.  And then I fucked up Travis, I think.  I put the book right in front of his fucking face when he was getting his picture.  Oh no.  He's a big fan too.  He's a big fan of Tony because he's a Ravens fan, right?  And then what was the other thing?  Oh, we were talking to him a little bit before he left and he goes, were you the guys that  did that thing in the mall at Short Hills?  I was there that day.  And he was talking about the homeless shopping spree.  Yeah, the stinky people in the fucking mall.  And he's like, that was fucking hilarious.  You guys got to do that again. 
[01:56:30]  I'm like, well.  Ah, well, I don't think.  Nah.  I go, Tony, we've been trying for three years.  You know what he said?  He goes, they fuck up everything, don't they?  Yes, they do.  So even in his world, he understands that.  But he goes, yeah, I was there.  He goes, those smelly bums in your list.  You guys are crazy.  How many people were there?  I said there were thousands.  Yeah, you probably were a couple thousand.  At least a couple thousand.  Yeah.  2006 with Short Hills Mall?  Yeah. 
[01:57:00]  It's almost that time of year again to try to get this to work.  It won't happen.  You think they'll suggest the empty Costco again?  Yeah.  An empty Costco.  That was an alternative to our great promotion.  Yeah.  That worked year after year.  Guys, good news.  We could do the homeless shopping.  Oh, really?  Okay, okay.  What mall will we be holding that?  No, no, not at a mall.  Oh, really?  Okay.  A Costco.  Oh, no.  But we were still in at that point.  Like, Costco, all right, but it's big, 
[01:57:30]  and there's a lot of different things they could buy there.  All right, I'm willing to listen.  We're going to do it before they open.  Before they open.  And we're going to, you know, get about a hundred of your listeners.  Don't you know what the homeless shopping spree is supposed to be?  I laughed openly in someone's face.  I don't feel like mentioning his name today.  And he got really mad.  I'm like, of course I'm going to laugh at you.  And it wasn't the Radio Wizard, by the way.  It was the sales guy.  I'm like, of course I'm going to laugh at you.  This is stupid.  That's stupid.  The whole idea is to make people uncomfortable. 
[01:58:00]  And surprise.  Yeah.  The element of surprise, not to organize it and have it before Costco opens.  Who the fuck would listen to that show?  We're not doing it to help the homeless.  Right.  To hurt the other people.  You don't think anybody would enjoy that show?  Oh, God.  Imagine that.  Jesse Joyce is just waiting out there.  I don't know why.  He should be.  That's him, right?  Yeah.  So he should come in, I think, right?  Okay.  How'd them bring him in?  Sure.  Yeah, Jesse Joyce.  Invite him in.  Hey, Jesse. 
[01:58:30]  How you doing, man?  Good to see you, brother.  Hi, buddy.  What's up?  Jesse Joyce in studio.  How you doing, guys?  Good.  Not too bad.  Playing Nut Street, comedy room in Wilmington, North Carolina this weekend.  I am indeed.  It's a lame name for a comedy club, isn't it?  All comedy clubs, pretty stupid names.  I'm trying to think of one I like.  Well, the irony about that place is that it's actually on Nut Street.  Oh, is that it?  It's kind of like they went out of their way to, like, we're not going to do what other  clubs do and name it something lame.  They're like, just what street are we on?  It's like Banana Fart Drive.  Yeah, we tried to get a place on Zaney Avenue, but God damn it, couldn't close the deal. 
[01:59:00]  It would be even better if it was a place to cure testicular cancer.  Nut Street.  Jesus.  Wow, I didn't even know there was a club in Wilmington.  Oh, North Carolina, I'm thinking Delaware.  Okay, yeah, I don't think I've ever...  That's like a big...  They shoot a lot of TV shows there now.  Why?  I don't know.  Like, they got some tax breaks.  Oh, I know why.  It's cheaper.  Yeah.  That's why, you know, a lot of the filmings leave in New York, because they just can't 
[01:59:30]  afford that shit, do they?  Yeah.  So they go to Toronto and make believe it's New York City.  That's ridiculous when that happens.  I hate when they do that, especially when you're a New Yorker.  You're like, this is so not New York.  Oh, look at the skyline.  Right.  Pittsburgh gives tax...  Kevin Smith shoots a lot in Pittsburgh, because they give a huge tax break.  It's just smart.  Well, I grew up in Pittsburgh, and nobody would know what Pittsburgh's geography looks  like, but prior to this movie break that they got...  Do you remember that movie, The Stigmata?  Remember that one?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's supposed to be set in Pittsburgh, but they shot it in Vancouver, which is like  19 times the city of Pittsburgh, so it's fucking ridiculous looking. 
[02:00:00]  Like, they're on their massive subway system and everything.  You're like, what?  There's not even an underground in Pittsburgh.  What the fuck are you talking about?  It's bizarre.  It is funny when they change the land...  Like, there's one thing that's always annoying me about Independence Day, and that was when...  One thing?  Yeah.  One thing?  Well, I mean...  Where do you want to begin?  I should say the first thing I hated about Independence Day was when they're showing the down view  of the city falling apart, and they show the Empire State Building, like, at the end of  a block.  And it doesn't come at the end of a block. 
[02:00:30]  It's on Fifth Avenue.  It's like, it doesn't...  You're absolutely right.  There's no way to see the Empire State Building like that.  You can't look down a block and see, at the end of it, the Empire State Building.  I don't think so, no.  But that fucking view annoyed me so much, because I know New York geography.  Yeah, he was picking up on those little things.  David, my son, David, he didn't annoy me more.  I was going to say, that bothered you more than Judah, than the guy who talked like the  Holocaust?  Ultra-Jew.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, my son, David, he saved you!  My David!  Do you think he was a little Jew-y stereotype? 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, he was a bit.  So over the top, man.  He was a bit over the top.  Hey, I just happened to be behind you when you were walking down the hall, and you said  to Roland, I was eavesdropping.  Or is it eaves?  Yeah, eavesdropping.  Eaves.  Eaves.  Yeah, in the eaves of the building.  Eavesdropping.  That's where you would go in the attic, and, oh, let me listen down the eaves.  I never knew the etymology of that.  Yes, it's eavesdropping.  Wow.  I like eavesdropping, because it's kind of easy.  You're just not really trying to hear a shit.  Well, that's true.  That's how they say it.  I rationalize it, because I don't know the proper word. 
[02:01:30]  That's how they've bastardized it in the black community.  All right, eavesdropping.  I've been eavesdropping and shit.  I've been eavesdropping and shit.  And I heard you tell Roland, hey, dude, the guys have Damien Echols in here yesterday.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And the only reason I bring that up, I guess, are you a...  I'm fascinated by that, dude.  You are.  And I, like, I had, you know, this coming up, and I was listening to you guys, like, yesterday,  and I heard you plugging that he was going to be here, and I was like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, wrong day.  That he was going to be here, like, today, the day, like, I show up, is, like, the most  interesting person of the 20th century.  And then fucking dick joke salesman Jesse Joyce, you know, it was like, oh, what a fucking 
[02:02:00]  awful day to show up today.  It was a really...  Oh, yeah, so, yeah.  It was a really good interview.  I'm sure.  And listen to part of it.  Me and Jimmy were talking on the way home.  We didn't talk about this yet on the air.  A couple times, he was really close to crying.  And I said to Jimmy, I think the reason is because he hasn't really done a long-form  interview like that, you know?  Right.  You do different...  He probably does shorter ones, and the long-form ones, he's done.  You start thinking a little more if you're him.  Well, they've been by TV people, and they're just in a different mindset. 
[02:02:30]  They're not...  I don't know.  But I think that we had a very comfortable conversation with him.  Absolutely.  And he loved it.  He was Twittering how much he loved it.  Yeah, he felt a lot more comfortable here.  He should have made it easier to talk about hard things, and we're going to have him back  in December if you want to come back.  Oh, great.  Because I was wondering, like, off-air, if he's kind of a haunted person.  Yeah.  He's a little intense, I think.  Yeah.  Come see us after your next murder.  Oh, I mean, fuck, shit.  Do you have any other pending homicides you'd like to plug?  We got career advice from him, though. 
[02:03:00]  You did?  We're thinking we've got to commit some kind of crazy fucking thing.  Get in jail, but make it look like we didn't do it.  I mean, I know we didn't do it, but I'm just saying for this stupid story.  And then all the celebrities will fucking embrace us.  That's what happens.  That's how you get that celebrity.  We've been at this a long time.  We've never met Eddie Vedder or fucking Johnny Depp.  Yeah.  No.  The dude's the Northern Irish guys in the 70s.  Paul Hill, he ended up marrying a Kennedy because of that.  You remember talking about the movie In the Name of the Father?  Yeah, the whole IRA thing. 
[02:03:30]  Yeah.  Same thing.  They got put in jail for 20 years.  They didn't do it.  Right.  And then you get out and you get to hang out with celebrities.  Then you marry a Kennedy.  Yeah, exactly.  You're fucking righteous.  Jimmy, I mean, you love celebrities.  You said your photo's taken with big stars.  I do very much.  Would you do 18 years in jail knowing on the other side you're going to be friends with  Johnny Depp?  No.  You sure?  I'd do a week for Johnny Depp.  I'd do a week.  I think you would do a year for Johnny Depp.  No, no, no, no.  I would do, the most I would ever do is like six months. 
[02:04:00]  And that would only be if De Niro and Pacino fought for me together.  Right.  And then Nicholson wanted to jump on.  I could hang with those guys.  You've got to do six months.  You'd be in during like fucking ass rape week.  That would be like, you know, we're just going to fuck the newbies, the new fish.  When I came in, they would really think that it was like a gift from the warden.  Oh my God.  Hairless Jimmy comes in.  Yeah.  All I know from...  Old doughy.  All I know about prison is what I've seen in Shawshank.  It seems like everything is ass rape week, isn't it?  Yeah, it's always ass rape week. 
[02:04:30]  We didn't ask.  52 ass rape weeks a year.  I think he got raped and he talked about it in the second documentary and I forgot to ask  him next time because I think he said for a year he got raped repeatedly.  Oh my God.  It came up and then finally, I don't know how it got stopped.  And it's just so hard to ask someone about that.  I was going to say, yeah, how would you actually ask someone about that?  We all kind of...  Broaching that prison rape subject.  We all knew that we heard the stories, but not one of us was brave enough to go, by the  way, how are you doing?  That's easier...  I see you're sitting, so that's a good sign. 
[02:05:00]  That's easier than a one-on-one.  If you're just talking to somebody in a small studio...  Or a shower.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's always easier one-on-one.  That's an easier question to ask without a room full of guys and a wife.  Like his wife was sitting right there.  Oh, yeah.  So it's like you don't want to...  Oh, I'm sure.  I'm sure she knows, but...  Oh, how do you go about that?  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Because, I mean, American History X, you see that scene, that prison rape scene?  Yeah.  With Edward Norton in there. 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, it was unrealistic, the whole setup, but it's like, I stop it right before that  part, and it's a great movie.  It's a pretty monumental day in your life.  You would think maybe, like, I wonder if you'd mark the anniversary years later, you're like,  oh, today's the day.  I bet you'd remember it.  It's like, oh, fuck, it's August 10th.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  It was fucking rape.  You can't be around a broom all day long.  The day that haunts him the most is the day he was supposed to be killed.  What was it? 
[02:06:00]  May 5th, I think you said?  His original execution date.  Yeah, the original execution date.  Yeah, 94.  So you start thinking about it like, boy, I wasn't even supposed to be around after this.  Yeah.  That's fucking weird.  He had a day for him.  He was supposed to go around May 5th, 19...  I want to say...  94, I think, was the original.  It was a trial.  And then, I mean, you're familiar with the case.  They really are.  We had Jason Baldwin in one time, too.  Jesse doesn't do press, I don't think.  He's the retarded one.  For your rape day, your relative's getting your big chocolate log cake. 
[02:06:30]  Just looking at it horrified.  Or a bunny.  Or an Easter bunny, but it's got tears coming down his face.  It's looking down at the ground because it's a shame.  Yeah, it's very ashamed.  And one little floppy ear is down because he's sad.  When you get it, the bottom is chewed out.  Yeah.  Oh, that would be wonderful.  Rape Easter candy.  Oh, yes.  So, I don't know much about this Jesse Joyce.  I know he's killing right now for us.  Oh, hey, that's sweet of you. 
[02:07:00]  Thanks.  Well, I know Jim for years.  Yeah, Jimmy, I highly recommend that you come on our show.  Thanks, buddy.  You're a roast writer guy.  Yeah, yeah.  You've written a lot of material for a lot of people that have done very well on the roasts.  Well, thanks.  Yeah.  Yeah, I was like really tight with Geraldo.  We threw around together for years and I was his opener and then I wrote all the stuff  with him on the roasts for years.  He was stand out as far as roasts go.  He was the guy, man.  When he came up, I was like, oh, good.  Well, he was the best to write for, too.  I kind of got sort of spoiled in the beginning because I was under his tutelage. 
[02:07:30]  That's how I started writing for roasts was just working with him.  Yeah.  And he was just game for anything, you know?  And we were close enough that I could argue in jokes that I was like, god damn, this is  funny.  Trust me.  Even if he didn't like the joke, he'd still do it because he respected my opinion.  And I'm sure he never went like, see, that fucking worked.  Half the time, it crushed.  And the other half the time, he was fucking totally right not to have done it.  But he did it anyway, you know?  But which is like a huge difference from writing for Larry King, who's just fucking 
[02:08:00]  Oh, man.  How do you do that?  Because you write for Larry King?  Yeah.  It's like the year that Greg died.  Wow.  The year Greg died, like he died.  And then the next roast was the Trump roast.  And they kind of didn't, because I was sort of a separate entity.  Like Greg and I were a team.  So I wasn't like officially on the roast staff.  So they kind of grandfathered me into the staff, but didn't know where to put me.  So for the first year, I was like writing for Larry King and Donald Trump.  And it was the fucking worst.  How do you do that?  Larry King's assistant is vetting everything for anti-Semitism, you know? 
[02:08:30]  Oh, my God.  Totally.  And then like, you know.  It's a roast.  He insisted on doing like joke jokes, like your grandpa's like two guys walk into a doctor's  office.  Like he wanted to do that shit at a roast.  And it was a disaster.  And then, you know, Donald Trump was such a fucking D-bag.  Was he?  I've met him twice.  And he's the worst person I've ever met in my life.  Wow.  That's hilarious.  Because like what he would.  Well, the first I was writing for Joan Rivers for this.  She did this show years ago called How'd You Get So Rich?  Do you remember that happening? 
[02:09:00]  It was on TV land.  It's like a it was like Lifestyles, the rich and famous.  But she was a cunt, you know, so she'd go to millionaires houses and make fun of them.  Really?  I remember that.  So I'd follow her around.  And I'd go to the house and then I would just pitch her jokes off camera.  Did you steal shit?  Oh, wow.  No.  But Mrs. Fields, do you know Mrs. of the cookie lady?  Yeah.  Because it was all new money people.  It wasn't like old money.  It was people who like made their money in a weird way.  Like the guy invented the Snuggie and the dude who owns the Hawaiian Tropic brand who  has the fucking tackiest house of all time, by the way. 
[02:09:30]  Why?  What makes it tacky?  I got to slow you down a little bit because there's too much going on here that I want to  ask you about.  I bet it's all fucking houses and surfboards and palm trees.  Yeah, what makes it tacky?  Yeah, and like nude statues, but not like classy, like neoclassical nude statues, like  slutty fucking plastic stripper statues, like with jugs of water, like just this hacky  awfulness, and like murals of people going down on each other.  Like it's just fucking stupid.  That was great. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, yeah.  There's no art whatsoever attached to it.  Yeah, but it's like a nice house.  So it's like you put a strip club in a mansion.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what it looks like.  And so anyway, so Mrs. Fields, who is extremely hot, by the way.  I don't know if you ever saw her.  Wow, really?  Pop her up there, Sam.  Look at Mrs. Fields.  She looks like Kathy Ireland, which you would think she'd be like a grandma type.  Yeah, yeah.  I thought she was black for some...  I don't know why I thought that.  No, that's famous Amos.  No, I know that.  You fucking cookie racist.  Wait, that's her?  Let me see what's Mrs. Fields.  Hey!  Oh my God.  Yeah.  I love to eat her ass. 
[02:10:30]  Mrs. Fields.  Tastes like fucking chocolate.  She's like made us cookies.  Is she the original?  Yeah, that's the Mrs. Fields.  Yeah.  How?  Not a figurehead at all?  They kind of kept her face off, like I think because nobody would have bought cookies from  a 20-year-old hot chick, you know?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, is she married?  Yeah, yeah.  Ah, cunt.  But she like made me cookies in her own oven.  Like it was awesome.  Wow.  Like I got actual Mrs. Fields.  But anyway, oh, so Donald Trump.  So we went to Trump's office to interview him and they needed like a man on the street 
[02:11:00]  to ask him financial advice question or whatever.  And like you can't actually get an idiot off the street.  Like that's a disaster.  So they were like, well, Jesse's a comic.  He'll do it.  You know, so I had to come up with a, you know, funny-ish question to ask Donald Trump  or something.  And so I was about to get married at the time.  So I was like, Mr. Trump, I'm about to marry my first wife.  Do you have any advice?  Oh, yeah.  He's been through a few.  Sure.  It's just like, it's not hilarious, but it was like, whatever.  It's like an alley-oop to hit something, you know?  And he goes, why would you call her your first wife? 
[02:11:30]  You haven't been married more than once.  Like it was just like you, fucking douche.  Like how about I didn't ask you why you have a dead raccoon on your head?  What's up with the hair?  It's the craziest thing in person.  You've met him, right?  I've met him, yeah.  Sort of.  Yeah, I've seen him.  It's really insane.  It's not that close, right?  It's a weird call-me-over thing.  He refused to do jokes about his hair on the roast.  That's the other thing.  Like it was like, well, how about you either address that?  Right.  Because everybody's going to hit that.  Everyone talks about it, yeah.  So like maybe you should rebut that or the fact that Eastern European horror is only  fucking for money. 
[02:12:00]  Like which of the two would you rather go with?  So how about we go with your hair?  And he would, this is the other thing I thought was the greatest about it.  He would jack up his numbers in the jokes.  You know what I mean?  Like, we'd send him the script and then he would send it back redacted.  Like nobody asked him to do it.  Like he would just, it would just be blacked out like a real estate contract and it was  like, what the fuck?  Like he took out every punchline, you know, just like, just like a big black marker.  Like an old CIA document that's been declassified.  Why was he doing that?  Because he didn't like the joke or he didn't get it.  And at the time he was pretending to run for president.  So, you know what I mean? 
[02:12:30]  So like we all had to like, so like this is the worst time to do a roast.  You know, it's just like when you're sensitive suddenly to your public image, you know?  Well, I think that's the problem with the roast.  Too many people are getting involved that don't understand the game.  Oh, totally.  And I think people cancel.  It was a beautiful art form for a while there, but then they're just bringing in mainstream  guys because it helps the ratings.  Like, no, man.  Yeah.  People cancel last minute all the time.  And I think it's because they agree to like, I would, I would love to honor Donald Trump  or whatever, you know?  And then like two days before their assistant's like, have you ever seen one of these fucking 
[02:13:00]  roasts?  And they're like, no.  And they try.  Oh, boy.  Like, yeah, the hell with that?  Right.  But yeah, so we'd have these jokes.  Like we had one, it was like that Donald was supposed to say that was, you know, kind  of toward like, you know how at the end you basically go like, fuck you guys, I'm better  than you.  You know, like that's the dismount of the roast.  And it was something like, and now I return to my 50,000 square foot, you know, marble penthouse  space station in the sky kind of a thing.  Like that was the gist of the joke.  Like he crossed out 50 and he put 100,000.  Like he needed people to know that his fictitious space station was bigger. 
[02:13:30]  You know what I'm saying?  Like shit like that.  Yes.  And we had another one that was like, what's the difference between Donald Trump's hair  and a wet raccoon?  Or what's the difference between Donald Trump and a wet raccoon?  Or what's the difference between Donald Trump's hair and a wet raccoon?  A wet raccoon doesn't have $3 billion.  And he crossed out three and put seven.  You know what I mean?  Like that was his contribution.  Was like, I need to jack up the numbers.  Of the joke-wise is like, no, I don't want people to think I don't make that.  Wait, did he have say over other people's jokes?  No, he didn't, right?  No. 
[02:14:00]  Well, they always get like, and I don't mind.  Like, I mean, if it's like their roast, they're allowed to kind of have sort of like  off topics.  Like, you know, like Saget was like, don't make fun of the Olsen twins.  You know, stuff like that.  Which, that's respectable.  Yeah, whatever.  He just kind of told us that.  Yeah.  So everybody kind of has like one thing.  Well, and I know when Tyson did the roast, they didn't want rape jokes.  He's like, I'm not going to sit there for two hours and just be called a rapist.  Like, you know, he didn't want guys being able to do that.  And they honored that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  That was disappointing for sure.  I was like, that's kind of the only reason we wanted you here. 
[02:14:30]  But I understand Tyson's point.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We had Tyson on.  Wow.  Did you?  An amazing.  He's awesome.  An amazing day.  He's a fucking interesting.  We were laughing so hard.  He's hilarious.  He's really fucking funny.  Genuinely funny.  Is he?  But you have that feeling.  You have that feeling that.  If you take it too far, he will punch you square in the fucking face.  That it's like one of those.  Yeah.  It's like the guy that had the dog all those years and then it just ripped his throat out  one day.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  That's how you feel with Mike Tyson. 
[02:15:00]  Well, it feels also like you're standing next to like the Parthenon.  Like, you know, like you ever stand next to something like solid?  Yes.  Like it's so.  The mass is so dense you can feel it next to you.  You're like, this guy's a shithouse.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  He's so packed.  He looks like that too.  He's just fucking fire hydrant.  Yeah, yeah.  His energy, he has a weird, he was a very fun energy when he was here.  It wasn't at all menacing, but you know his history and he's a street guy.  I mean, he's not some fucking.  You understand.  Yeah, that boundary between professional.  He'll smile as he beats the shit out of you.  But he really did bite a guy's ear. 
[02:15:30]  I mean, like he really did stuff that was like fighters never do that.  In the history of fighting, no one's ever done that.  He did it.  I could watch that a thousand times and still cringe because it's not just where he bites  and it's off.  He like had to rip it.  Yeah, it didn't come clean off.  It's that one point where he moves his head like a dog playing with a fucking, when you  give a dog a rag and he's just slapping around his head.  He did that with his head.  Unbelievable.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  Do you have anything else on the Joan Rivers show? 
[02:16:00]  I like hearing about these rich guys' houses.  How was it, by the way, how was it pitching her jokes live?  That seems scary.  You know, I was kind of ageist with comedy before.  Like I met Joan Rivers.  Like I had two sort of, I met Joan Rivers and then I went and saw Cosby live and it totally  changed my attitude.  Like before that, like, like I had a fucking Alan King, whatever.  Like who gives a shit?  You know what I mean?  Like if like David Brenner was performing in my bathtub and I had to piss, I would wait.  You know, like that's how little I want to hear like old dudes do comedy.  For the most part.  But you can't cheat time with comedy. 
[02:16:30]  Like they are untouchably awesome because they've been doing it 50 years.  And Joan was like 76 or something.  And I'd be standing across the room while she was in the middle of a conversation with  somebody and I would scrawl a joke on a whiteboard and hold it up across the room.  She would be in the middle of the conversation.  She would glance at it, turn back and punch it up.  Like make my joke better.  Like in the middle of a conversation.  I was like, holy shit, she's fucking amazing.  Like she was hilarious the whole time.  She seems like, because I watched her do stand-up and she's a fucking machine. 
[02:17:00]  Joan Rivers is, I think she's very underrated.  That documentary made me sad though.  Really?  It's kind of dumb that she sees herself as an actress.  Come on, John.  Well, it just seems like she's still chasing something.  Like she's not satisfied.  Right.  She's had an amazing career.  And it seems like she's just still chasing something.  Yeah, but every comic, like if you watched Comedian, that documentary with Seinfeld,  like everybody's like, oh man.  It's just an unsettled lifestyle.  It's long enough to know you guys are fucking us.  I think comics need that though.  Because it keeps you going.  Because if like, something like Joan Rivers is like, now she's 79 or whatever, or 70.  If you feel like, okay, I am one of the greats, then it's like, where do I go from here? 
[02:17:30]  Like if you feel like there's something else to work for, it just kind of keeps you moving.  But the part where she came home at like four in the morning from a gig in the middle  of nowhere, I'm like, do you really have to do those gigs still?  I understand she wants to gig and all that, but it was a horrible casino.  I forgot, because it's been a few years.  It's been a horrible casino no one has ever heard of.  I was in like the upper peninsula of Michigan or something horrendous like that.  It was really in a weird place.  I'm like, Joan Rivers still has to do gigs like that.  Probably making 70 grand though.  Or 80 grand.  But then she was in the car, and it was a weak moment. 
[02:18:00]  You could tell she just was fucking tired.  Watching Seinfeld go back to stand-up after doing Seinfeld like that was just weird.  It's like, wait, you're that guy.  And you're really like a road comic here.  Yeah.  You know, just, yeah, that didn't go well.  Yeah.  I'm in a corporate gig.  It's like, really?  You would fucking, you'd think you could just go, well, I did everything I want to do.  I'm just going to sit back and go, ha, ha, ha, ha, all day.  But no, you just want to get back out there. 
[02:18:30]  And he's getting back out there.  And hit the road.  I think he's bored finally.  Oh, he's still doing gigs.  Tom Papa or Mario or, you know, George, who's the older black dude?  And whatever, those guys all work with him.  Oh.  We know George.  We don't know a lot.  I know.  I can't think of his name right now.  George Wallace.  Yeah.  That's pretty.  Yeah.  But yeah, he'll work with those guys.  And now Colin's doing this New York thing, One Night in Each Borough.  Right.  With Seinfeld.  He loves doing stand-up band.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He loves it.  Yeah, I remember seeing that when I was like, kind of like a newer comic, like seeing  comedian, and it was like my catcher in the rye. 
[02:19:00]  I was like, holy shit, this is exactly what it's like.  Yeah.  And then he gets in a private jet.  And I'm like, oh, yeah.  Oh, okay.  That's where it's.  I get back in my 82 Nissan Sentry.  That's where it changes.  Oh, okay.  I watched him film most of that because it was at the cellar.  Right.  And I was not asked to be interviewed.  Oh, dear.  Why, you think?  I don't know.  Look at Jimmy.  I'm not sure.  Oh, you know.  By the way, I'm.  You just don't want to say.  I mean, no, I actually don't. 
[02:19:30]  I mean, he just didn't know me.  I'm in Columbus tomorrow, two shows, Saturday, three shows.  And I'm doing morning press there tomorrow.  And I have like three radio shows.  But the one station, they replaced the show I had done.  And now it's Loper from fucking Florida.  Oh, wait a minute.  So, of course, he passed on me.  Oh, the Lopwizers.  The Lopwizers.  The Lopwizers.  They opened the beer.  What?  What?  He ditched his partner.  Why are you whispering to him?  Oh, my God.  Jump in. 
[02:20:00]  Who cares?  You were talking.  I didn't want to interrupt you.  That a boy.  Good boy.  Smart.  Who did he ditch?  It was Loper and Smitty down there.  I remember Schmitty.  And he ditched that kid.  And now it's him and his wife do a show together.  Oh, that's smart.  Wow.  That's what you want to do.  I'm really happy I'm not on that station.  Is he still in Florida?  No, he's Ohio.  Only Columbus.  I know where I'm going.  Oh, that's the only market he's in?  So he went from Florida to Columbus?  That's not good.  He's got long blonde hair now.  No offense to Columbus, but...  He's all tatted up.  Loper and Randy. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Randy.  Would you have done the show?  Sure.  I'll do any of them.  I'll do any show.  That's hilarious.  We beat the shit out of this guy there, Jesse.  Just so you know.  You physically hit him?  Well, no.  No.  With our words.  Oh, look at us.  Really?  Who have I beaten up?  Physically.  If you heard that Ruth Gordon got her pussy kicked in, maybe I'm responsible for it.  Oh, Jimmy, why did you do that?  I was doing that to Colin last night.  I just kept patting his wrists.  You're among friends, Ricky. 
[02:21:00]  They seem like they've been married.  They are actually starting to look alike, you know, the two of them, if you notice that  one blonde picture where they're both.  That's his wife?  Yeah.  I'm sure she's fine with us.  But how do you do that?  I don't know.  How do you do a show with your wife?  You wouldn't do a show with your ex-wife.  Oh, God.  Yeah, first 48.  Rich and Bonnie pulled it off, though.  I mean...  They do.  Yeah.  They're funny together.  Rich, they have a great sense of humor about themselves.  I did something with them the other day where there was a film crew around.  There was a lot of people. 
[02:21:30]  And Rich was just being a dummy.  You know, just asking the same...  And Bonnie screamed at him in front of everybody.  Like, why don't you just pretend you fucking know it?  Wow.  But it was like, I understood her frustration at this absolute dumbbell.  But he didn't...  I would fucking strangle the girl if she spoke like that to me.  I would have been embarrassed.  Oh, of course.  But Voss is like, oh, fuck you.  And they just kind of laughed about it.  Rich is unflappable.  That's a weird relationship, man.  But they both are able to come back quickly from embarrassment.  What's because Voss knows he's dumb? 
[02:22:00]  Yeah, it's not like a surprise.  He doesn't get offended when you call him stupid because he just kind of knows he is.  You see the wall behind you?  Yeah, all those papers.  Those are Voss's words that aren't real words.  He fucks them up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And we gave up keeping up with that, more or less.  We tried to put one in the other day and then realized it was already up on the list.  Yeah.  When he said, uh, Liam Nilsson.  Liam Nilsson.  There's got to be a thousand words at this point up there.  And yeah, I think it was, was it you, Sam, that went up there? 
[02:22:30]  And he goes, oh, it's up here already.  That's fucking good.  We should give Rich Voss the book idea.  You put that in a book, I think people would fucking buy it.  Yeah.  His mispronunciation's all over.  Oh, shit.  You want to hear about a man that had donkey, uh, sex?  What?  It's a good story.  Sure.  Jesse Joyce is playing, uh, the Nutt Street Comedy Room in Wilmington, North Carolina this  weekend.  Mm-hmm.  And Jesse Joyce on, uh, Twitter.  Listen to this.  An especially disturbing story out of Marion County.  An Ocala farmhand arrested after he was caught having sex with a donkey. 
[02:23:00]  The arrest report says a man delivering a horse to the farm he rents caught Carlos Romero  with his pants down, engaged in sex acts with the animal.  He's been charged with sexual activity involving an animal.  Well, of course his pants were down.  Like, that would be creepier if he was eating his pussy.  That happened.  That happened, like, a month ago.  Did you know that story?  God damn.  We did it on The Burn, that show with Jeff Ross.  Wow.  We had a whole thing about, that in, uh, Seattle, some dude fucking performed cunnilingus 
[02:23:30]  on a horse.  It's always Seattle.  What's wrong with those people?  I don't know.  They're depressed because of the rain.  Isn't that the place where the guy got fucked to death by him?  You're a kind of pinion, yeah.  They love their horses out there.  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  Fucking licking a horse's box.  Oh, the story is, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, like, what are you getting out of that?  You know what I mean?  Like, wow.  Like, not that, you know.  Wow.  Yeah.  Horses start shitting on the side of your face.  Oh, it's brutal.  Doesn't understand what you're doing.  You know what that's got to say?  It thinks you're a pinworm. 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, just, the tail starts swatting like you're a fly, like you're a bot fly back there.  Buss off, fella.  A frisky farm handcuffed after originally telling police he masturbated with a donkey told the Florida court Tuesday he wants his burrow back.  He's pissed because he paid $500 for this thing.  Oh, he paid for it?  He paid $500.  What other part there, Travis?  What else is in this story?  I don't feel like reading the whole thing.  That was it, pretty much?  Well, he also wants the guy that busted him to be charged with being a peeping Tom. 
[02:24:30]  Oh, what a...  Oh, really?  Yeah, he's upset at Florida because they don't believe in zoophilia.  Yeah, he says, I've had a sexual excitement with animals more than humans.  Yeah, he's not interested in humans.  I would have eventually had sex with Doody?  Doodle.  Oh, Doodle.  Doody.  Oh, Doodle.  Doodle.  But told the newspaper that he didn't because she's blooming into maturity.  Oh, my God. 
[02:25:00]  Wait, he's not a molester?  Pedophile fucking...  No, he's not.  Yeah, I mean, it's creepy.  Like, I want to wait until the horse is of age.  Yeah, yeah.  He's not a pedophile.  Oh, I thought he was a pedophile.  In a twist, Romero said it was James who should have been arrested for invasion of privacy  and being a peeping Tom.  This guy is a fucking lunatic.  Yeah, what a psychopath.  He looks crazy, yeah.  He looks crazy in the eyes, right?  Crazy eyes.  Crazy eyes.  Creep.  He admitted to masturbating with the animal five or six times.  Oof.  I want to just say it was your first time.  And called Florida backwards because people, yeah, frown on zoophilia. 
[02:25:30]  Are you masturbating with the animal?  I guess you...  What is he talking about?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Is it jerking the thing off and jerking yourself off?  Obviously, it can't jerk you off.  Those hooves kind of...  Well, if it's Doodle, that might be a female horse.  Doodle.  So what, he's fucking finger-popping her?  Oh, God.  Creepy.  A fucking donkey pussy.  You probably have to use a paint can for that thing.  Yeah.  Pretty enormous.  Wow. 
[02:26:00]  That is pretty cool.  He just got...  You know what?  There is something, though, about, like...  He doesn't give a shit.  You know what I mean?  Like, he's smiling.  Is that his smoke shot?  Yeah, look at that.  Because he's loving his smoke shot.  He's like, yeah, that's me.  You know?  Yeah.  I fuck donkeys.  I'm the donkey fucker.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He doesn't seem to care.  No.  I like a man who embraces it.  Blames everybody but himself.  You shouldn't have fucked that donkey.  You shouldn't have looked.  Fair enough.  So this guy, James, goes, he was delivering a horse when he saw Romero shirtless.  Gotta take that shirt off.  Yeah, play with your nips.  A little nip play. 
[02:26:30]  With his pants pulled down, appearing to have sex with a donkey in an equipment room.  Jesus.  Wow.  Poor donkey.  Gotta stand up on something.  Oh, you want to know more?  Yes.  When police interviewed Romero, he allegedly told them he had used his fingers  to clean the animal's genitals.  Ew!  This is so disgusting.  He generally becomes aroused seeing animals in heat.  The sexual contact he allegedly told police was an accident.  I accidentally stuck my dick in her?  Yeah. 
[02:27:00]  Cleaning the pussy with his finger.  Cleaning it.  What's he just...  He's probably scooping out gunk.  Ugh!  Because when they shit, they probably shit and it drips into their pussy.  Of course it does.  Donkeys probably have their own shit in their pussy.  Oh, gosh.  So you have to scoop it out.  Nothing worse than cow fucking pussy and ass.  They just...  Shit just streams down.  It goes from their tail down to their fucking ankles.  It's like a window washer washing windows above first.  Yeah.  The upper window is how the lower windows look.  That's a cow ass.  No one ever gets caught fucking a cow because that's why. 
[02:27:30]  They just got shit box.  That's a terrific story.  Lovely.  Oh, my God.  Wonderful.  Hey, did I...  Was John Rivers mean to Mrs. Fields?  Uh, well, just...  Yeah, kind of.  You know?  Like, in a...  In a jokey way.  Like, everything was funny, but it was roasty.  You know, sort of.  You know?  Yeah.  She's great at that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  She is great.  How does her house look?  With Jones?  Mrs. Fields.  Uh, it's just a nice house.  A lot of shoes.  Whatever.  Yeah.  It's just that kind of thing.  A lady.  Yeah, yeah. 
[02:28:00]  A lot of the shoes ladies.  A real lady.  Fuck.  What did she do?  Did she just rip down her while she was interviewing her?  Yeah, yeah.  Pretty much.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, she just comes to the house and then, like, makes fun of, you know,  whatever dumb artwork they have on the walls and, you know, then interviews her and just  makes fun of her.  That's kind of the gist.  She's so good off the cuff, man.  Yeah, yeah.  She is fucking great.  Yeah.  I'd be embarrassed to do that.  I'd be like, oh, no, I can't.  I'm like...  Yeah, she's great.  She's great at a roast, too, you know?  Which is tough to make fun of an old lady, you know what I mean?  Like, you know, in principle, you know?  Yeah.  Like, even though she's been, you know, mean to everybody, like, you know what I mean? 
[02:28:30]  They're just like, I don't pick on an old lady, you know?  But the weirdest thing is that her only stipulation was, don't make fun of Melissa.  No, Melissa.  No, Edgar.  What's that about?  No, that's the thing.  She didn't say Edgar.  Yeah, like, you could make as many suicide jokes about her husband as you wanted.  Did anybody?  Yeah, yeah.  We had a couple.  Yeah.  A couple of good ones?  Yeah, yeah.  But it was the coroner listed Edgar's cause of death married to Joan Rivers. 
[02:29:00]  But, yeah, I wrote a joke that...  Why not Melissa, though?  What's that about?  Well, because she's so overprotective, or whatever.  Yeah, but she pushed her into the spotlight with this entertainment shit.  I agree with you.  Melissa has no business being in entertainment.  Yeah.  Well, because of her mom, her mom's given her some good gigs over the years.  Yeah.  I wrote a joke that made Melissa Rivers literally walk out of the taping, and they had to stop  production for 10 minutes to, like, court her back.  Why?  Was she sitting up there?  No, no, no.  She was in the crowd, but if you watch the Joan Rivers roast, she goes up, Melissa, goes 
[02:29:30]  up on stage just to tell Greg Giraldo to go fuck himself.  That's, like, literally all she does.  She doesn't have any jokes.  She just goes up for 45 seconds and goes, thanks, everybody, for being here to honor  my mom.  Fuck you, Greg Giraldo.  That's all that she does.  And the only reason that's there is because of the joke I wrote.  They had to add that part in, which was, the joke was, she and Michael Jackson had the  same plastic surgeon, which is just a fact, like, Joan Rivers.  So they actually had a lot in common. 
[02:30:00]  They're both more popular now that they're dead.  They both spent millions of dollars to look like a creepy old white lady, and they both  raised a chimp.  And she fucking walked out.  That's hilarious.  She stormed out.  That's hilarious.  And they had to, like, shut down the whole goddamn taping to, like, get her back, you  know?  That's brilliant.  What a baby.  That's funny.  Because Melissa does look like a chimp.  She does.  Around the mouth and stuff, especially.  Yeah.  It's creepy.  Good for you, Jesse Joyce.  Thanks, my friend.  Fucker.  And Greg did the joke, of course.  Yeah, yeah, of course.  Did he get a big laugh? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And even though that was the thing, like, even everybody involved was kind of like, yeah,  but you should still do that anyway.  Like, even though there was the...  Was Joan annoyed?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She seemed to be cool with it at the end of everything.  But she was kind of, I think, one of the ones who was like, we're shutting this down  until Melissa comes back, you know?  So...  That wasn't that awkward.  Who had to go on after that?  It was very awkward.  No, Greg was still on.  Like, it was during Greg's set.  Wait, and they stopped his set?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  To get her back.  Shouldn't she understand comedy and roast and all that?  Well, why even have...  She's been around her whole life. 
[02:31:00]  Right.  Her mother's made fun of everybody.  Yeah.  So, wait.  How'd they stop Greg's set?  Like, Melissa made a big scene of, like, storming out, and they had to, like, get her back.  So...  Oh, my.  What a...  A tension whore.  Is that a me, me, me situation, Jimmy?  What a baby.  We hate the me, me, me shit.  So, Greg stopped and was like, uh...  Yeah, pretty much.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Sat back down and...  It was only, like...  While they talked to her backstage, maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  They talked to her backstage.  You think they had to, like, kind of coddle her backstage, Jimmy?  Oh, yeah.  Hey, look.  Sit her down.  Look, man.  But I'm just...  But I think that she was like, I'm only coming back if you let me go up and tell Greg 
[02:31:30]  Geraldo to go fuck himself.  Oh, really?  Which is exactly what happened.  Yeah.  So, then, yeah.  Get up there, Cole.  Yeah, yeah.  And that should have been fair game for you guys to really go at it.  Yeah.  Well, yeah.  But, I mean, it was kind of a last minute.  That's how that shit works.  It's like when someone comes up and testifies.  Yeah, now you open yourself up for cross.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  Let her rip.  That should have been some cross.  You fucking monkey bitch.  Was Greg bummed out about it, or was he annoyed?  No, he was fine with it.  He didn't...  He didn't care.  Like, about upsetting.  Did he go back on and finish his set?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Totally.  Yeah.  Well, why don't we break? 
[02:32:00]  Wow.  And we can continue with Jesse Joyce.  Anything else you're promoting?  Yeah.  I'm at the Cellar tonight, and then I'm doing...  I got a web series coming out.  It's September 28th.  It's on official comedy.  It's called Next Week in History.  Good for you.  Yeah.  Next Week in History.  Well, it's like the air on Friday, so I talk about everything that's coming up in history  the following week.  Smart concept.  So I'm a big history nerd.  And also...  Yeah.  I got a lot of stuff.  Oh, really?  We'll talk history next week.  I know a lot about history, too.  I know a little bit. 
[02:32:30]  He knows a lot.  I know all the good stuff.  Cool.  He knows the Hitler shit.  I'm a history hack.  Yeah.  You know, Hitler.  Right.  Yes.  Nut Street Comedy Room in Wilmington, North Carolina.  That's where Jesse Joyce will be this weekend, and Jimmy's in Columbus at the Funny  Boat.  The Funny Boat.  You guys are flying out today, right?  We're flying out this afternoon.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  New from Grody Publishing comes the audiobook, So Erotic, it will make you question everything. 
[02:33:00]  Damn, that's a good book on tape.  The best-selling cultural phenomenon evolves just for men.  It's Fifty Shades of Gay.  The muscles inside the deepest, darkest part of me clench in the most delicious fashion.  Club Soda Kenny takes you on a journey you've only been to in your deepest fantasies.  Suck me, baby.  Millions of red-blooded men have gotten rigid over the excitement of Fifty Shades of Gay. 
[02:33:30]  Bro, I've tasted my cum?  After hearing Fifty Shades of Gay, I would totally be down for tasting someone else's.  Or whatever.  I'm a quivering, moist mess, and he hasn't even touched me.  I've always been a guy that's, like, totally into chicks with tits and stuff like that.  But you know what?  This book is frickin' hot as shit.  Holy fuck.  This is wrong.  But holy hell, is it erotic. 
[02:34:00]  For the first time, I'm sexually attracted to something that isn't available at the deli counter.  My insides practically contort with potent, needy, liquid desire.  Ooh, I don't fuck guys, man.  But I'll jack off to this, man.  Damn!  The experts agree Fifty Shades of Gay is a must-listen.  Hello, I'm Dr. Gay.  This audiobook is a must-listen for any man looking to further a healthy sex life.  I'm erect.  Fifty Shades of Gay. 
[02:34:30]  If you're not turned on now,  you will be yum.  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Ed Lee Show.  Jesse Joyce on the show for the first time.  Indeed.  Hope you're having fun.  I am. It's great.  Yeah, absolutely. You've got good stories. 
[02:35:00]  Nut Street Comedy Room in Wilmington, North Carolina this weekend.  And Jesse Joyce on the Twitter.  Monica Lewinsky.  Where's Jimmy?  Because he's going to love me.  What year is this?  Jesus.  You know, you're right.  But I was reading about her today.  She's going to do a tell-all finally.  She's had it.  She was trying to keep some shit to herself.  And it turns out, talking about Monica Lewinsky.  You think that's the modus operandi?  Yeah, I think you're right.  It's what I'm about to say.  She's looking like, oh, my stupid bags that I'm making aren't selling. 
[02:35:30]  And she's saying, basically, Clinton has prevented her from getting a lot of gigs and stuff.  So now she's saying, fuck this.  I'm doing the book.  She's going to get $12 million.  $12 million.  Even this many years later, huh?  Wow.  And she's saying stuff like, Bill loved threesomes.  I don't know if that meant he did threesomes.  I don't know if that meant he actually did the threesomes.  You know, maybe talked about it with her or whatever.  And loved the sex toys. 
[02:36:00]  Well, the cigar thing.  All kinds of sex toys.  He liked doing the...  Yeah, but then I wonder if she was doing the sex toys.  Oh, boy, that would be a great thing.  Picturing Bill Clinton just taking a fucking vibrator up his head.  Wait, what kind of gigs did he prevent her from getting?  Yeah.  Give me the other paper.  I think it's in the other paper.  It's in front of you, Jimmy.  He fucked two girls at the same time, and they were both Monica Lewinsky.  Because she's fat.  Come on.  She's fat.  She's fat. 
[02:36:30]  You want the post or the Daily News?  Yeah, yeah, the post.  Can you pass that down?  I certainly can.  You might even have the story.  I was like, it's a little late, though, to be writing this book.  But she's still getting $12 million.  That's amazing.  Yeah, here's the basics.  Monica Lewinsky is promising to reveal secret love letters to Bill Clinton.  Ooh.  And his penchant.  To Bill Clinton or from her?  Two.  One, she never sent, I guess.  Oh, who cares?  I know, that's a little weird, right?  All right, let me come up with some letters from...  At least fucking make copies of the ones you actually sent, so we know as the reader, 
[02:37:00]  like, holy fuck, Bill Clinton actually read this?  Yeah.  But even still, like, of course.  Like, you're a 20-year-old who fucked the president.  Like, of course you wrote him love letters.  Like, why would you...  You want to feel old?  You want to feel old?  Yeah, what?  She's 40 now.  No shit.  Wow.  She's 40, all right?  She's 40 years old.  Monica Lewinsky's 40 years old.  That's crazy.  40?  She was the young intern.  Will turned 40 next year.  She's looking at 40.  Is she married or anything or no?  His penchant...  Let's see, in this article.  His penchant for kinky sex in a new tell-all about her days as his favorite intern. 
[02:37:30]  So he liked the kinky sex.  Kinky?  She's turning 40, is out for revenge, and ready to air bombshell details from her Oval Office  trysts with the former Horndog-in-Chief.  Horndog-in-Chief?  We could probably get her in here to plug it, though.  That's not even...  Whoever makes the copy for that shit is the worst.  12 million.  Wow.  12 million.  Lewinsky never got explicit in past interviews about her Clinton encounters, but now plans  to describe his insatiable desire for three-way sex, orgies, and the use of sex toys of all kinds. 
[02:38:00]  I said, come on her in chief.  Yeah.  There you go.  Nice.  Yeah.  Well, he fucked up with a cigar.  Like, sex toys seem like actually a downgrade.  Yeah, that cigar.  Do you think he was giggling when he did that?  Yeah, come here.  Put a crack pipe in her, asshole.  Uh, let's see.  There was something about Hillary in here, too.  Oh, no.  How long did she fuck him for?  18 years.  Oh, I thought it was a briefer time. 
[02:38:30]  No, it was 18 years.  Oh, wow.  All right.  That's a lot to talk about.  Ended last week, I think.  Thus, then, why the book?  I wonder if it was a year.  Yeah, I don't know.  What do you think, for real?  Let's write a book.  I mean, there better be a lot of, uh...  That's a long year.  She was just a juicy little fucking...  You think she was, you know...  She's probably a good fuck.  She's probably a sloppy mouth.  Jesus.  How do you know?  I don't know, man.  I just do.  She was probably a good little fuck.  A little dirty girl.  Oh, here it is.  Okay, according to her friends, Lewinsky also will recount how Clinton referred to wife 
[02:39:00]  Hillary as a cold fish.  Wow.  And laughed about their non-existent sex life.  No surprise there.  This is all shit we all know.  This is nothing new.  I didn't even fuck Bill Clinton, and I know that.  Yeah, yeah.  They obviously stayed married because it was great for both their careers, right?  When was the last picture you saw of them together?  When was the last thing you heard?  She can't get off of this fucking continent quickly enough.  She took a job she didn't want.  She didn't want the job, and it puts her away from Bill all the time. 
[02:39:30]  The whore dog.  Bill's never out with her.  She wasn't at the convention.  She wasn't, like, nothing.  Do you think she knows he fucked other women?  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  He didn't change all of a sudden.  I talked to my spiritual advisor.  No.  He likes fucking women, and he's still doing it.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  All right.  There's two other things in here.  So these letters that I don't think she sent, the letters that will be in the book.  In them, she opened up her heart about her love for Bill and how much happier she could 
[02:40:00]  make him.  Like, he would fucking go for that?  Yeah.  I swear, I'm going to blow off my politically powerful wife for this thing.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Throw a monkey wrench in my political career for some fat-ass intern.  That's delusional.  I wonder what it's like, though, honestly.  You know how it is when you pull off someone's pants and you're fucking about to eat her pussy?  But if you're a woman, what's it like to fucking have the cock of the president pop out  in your face for the first time?  The president's dick just flops out at you. 
[02:40:30]  You suck it and just keep thinking, president cock or president cock.  Got to, right?  Yeah.  You think he's got a good piece or there's some problems with it?  I bet it's shorter.  Shorter and probably girthy with a big head.  He probably has big fucking balls.  That's what he has to do.  Yeah, I don't think you have, you set your political ambitions that high if you have a  giant cock.  You know what I mean?  Like, you don't really need to.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got to think she'll write about that, too, in the book, right?  And she's in the Oval Office looking around at, like, history as she's just sucking the 
[02:41:00]  president's dick.  Right.  I'm like, wow, this is...  Because, you know, like that dude, remember that guy who got stopped by airport security  like six months ago because he has the biggest dick in the world?  We had him on the bus.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He is a dick, too.  Like, years ago.  What's he doing?  He's like a fucking waiter, right?  Yeah, he's a dick.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  So see what I mean?  Like, he's the dude with the largest cock in the world.  Right.  Waits fucking tables.  You know what I mean?  So...  Because you're really just...  You're always using your dick.  You're always like, here.  What a great thing to be stopped for, your giant cock. 
[02:41:30]  He came in here with bicycle shorts on, and it almost hits his knee.  Really?  It's ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And then we brought girls in to kind of look, you know?  That's how we did it that day, and he was all offended and shit.  I'm like, well, you got the big dick.  What do you want us to do with you?  Shut up.  Talk about politics?  That's why you're here.  Show your dick and get the fuck out of here.  You know that's why we invited you on the show.  Yeah, yeah.  You kind of had an attitude.  I'm like, how do you have an attitude?  Right.  If this is what you're known for. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, okay.  And this is why she's writing the book.  No one will hire her, and she can't get a job because of Clinton.  Because of Clinton.  What's he doing to stop her?  She needs to make money somehow, so she's, like, finally taking the deal.  She...  Unless this is a big bluff.  She probably didn't take the deal for all those years, because in her sick fucking head,  she probably thought she was going back to Bill.  Oh.  And Bill was going to see it her way, finally.  She'd have to be completely insane, TV.  Yeah, but again, when you fuck the president, it's kind of...  Wow.  I'll bet you that they kept...  You probably told her some dumb shit.  Yeah, well, you know, give it time. 
[02:42:30]  Give it time.  Give it time.  Nobody cares about her anymore.  No one really cares anymore.  You know what I mean?  She's like Rudy.  Rudy Rudiger.  That fucking guy, his whole life is just, remember when I did that thing?  You know what I mean?  Like, that's what she's doing.  This is, I think, it's amazing it comes up now when Clinton is in the news, or was in  the news because of the convention and given the speech, and he's on a lot of the commercials  now, the Obama commercials.  And that's the only reason this is popping out now.  They needed somehow, any little inkling of Clinton getting back in the public eye for 
[02:43:00]  her to come out with this, because it's nothing new.  But he's skated, because people fucking love President Clinton.  They love him.  They love him.  I wonder if she's really going to write the book, or if this is a bluff to get him to  move to get her a nice gig.  Or get a nice gig.  Or a little payday, by the way.  I'll make some phone calls, you fucking cunt.  Yeah.  Yeah, man.  Because he might have a few dirt.  I imagine if she fucked him with a strap-on.  Oh, man.  Where do you keep the presidential strap-on? 
[02:43:30]  There has to be a very secure closet.  It's got his shit all over it.  You know what?  She could say anything.  She could say anything she wants, because is he going to refute it?  No.  If he does, then he's got to talk about what they really did do.  We have our new hero on the phone.  Oh, cool.  Let's get right to him.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah.  Yo, Julian.  Hey, how's it going?  Let me set this up.  We're starstruck, man.  And we do this shit for a living.  This is the guy that was making the blowjob just as behind home plate at the Cubs game. 
[02:44:00]  Is it really you?  This is the one and only.  Dude, we've been fucking howling.  That is so fucking funny.  You know, anyone, anyone could just make the one-handed blowjob move and do it very, very covertly so you don't get in trouble.  You're doing the double pump, the fucking crazy freestyle.  You know, we're watching it right now. 
[02:44:30]  Now, you didn't have it.  That wasn't your seat, right?  Oh, of course, Matt.  See, what happened was, since it was a rain delay, I was granted any seat.  You know, they said, yeah, here's an upper deck seat, but anywhere you want to.  Yeah.  So, you know, at first, I originally felt like maybe 10 rows behind Sam Ricketts, or, yeah, Sam Ricketts, who was at the game.  And, but then I see a seat right behind home plate, right behind the Budweiser sign, and I'm saying, oh, my God, this is golden. 
[02:45:00]  You know, how can you turn around this opportunity?  And for the first, like, six or seven innings, you know, I'm, like, picking my nose and showing my nipple.  Oh, really?  Is it other footage?  We haven't seen that footage yet.  Yeah, I'm sure you'll see, you know, you'll see me, like, doing the Cunglingus sign and everything.  But it isn't until the ninth inning, though, that I really, I go all out. 
[02:45:30]  I go ham, and I check in the blowjob thing, and then that's when they go, all right, that's it.  That's enough.  What did they say to you?  What did they say to you?  Because the security guy was obviously on the phone going, is this the seat?  What was he saying to you?  So I hear, I'm sitting there, and I hear this walking, talking, you know, progressively closer and closer to me.  And I hear this, something, ups and downs, or, ups and downs.  Uh-oh.  And as soon as they pat me on the shoulder, I'm like, is it time to go?  And they're like, yep, sure it is. 
[02:46:00]  It's the time to go.  So they're walking me out, and, you know, they're not really saying anything, but a few people in the crowd are booing them, are booing security for kicking me out, because people at the end, and the fans were actually getting kicked out of my antics.  Yeah, I saw, I saw, yeah, a couple of the people next to you were really laughing.  Yeah, and so they were booing security.  But then, you know, of course, you know, there were a few fans who were, you know, yelling at me and telling me to go back to Boys Town. 
[02:46:30]  And Boys Town is a neighborhood, the gate neighborhood next to Ridleyville.  So, and then, um, they escorted me out, they took my information down, like, they had to, like, got my driver's license and, like, my ticket.  And so, um, but that was it.  And then they told me to take a hike, and so I did.  Oh, so they didn't charge you with anything?  That's cool.  What could they charge you with?  I don't know.  They're being silly.  They make up shit.  Yeah, they do make up shit.  Uh, wow.  So, did, did any of you, what do your friends think? 
[02:47:00]  Oh, they're quite proud.  I thought they would be.  What was, I didn't tell anyone at work about it, um, and it wasn't until, how about 10.30 in the morning, I hear my boss go, baby!  My nickname at work is Baby, by the way.  Jesus.  I'm six foot, I'm six foot four, and yet they're, like, you know, I'm just still, like, call me baby.  And, uh, my boss, my boss, uh, he sees that I'm on Deadspin, and he starts, like, screaming, like, you know, babe, you're on, you're on Deadspin, you're on Deadspin! 
[02:47:30]  I'm like, what are you talking about?  And sure enough, there I am, like, you know, screencapping me, you know, uh, giving, you know, a blowjob to the ghost of Harry Carey.  That is, I didn't know you were doing the whole game.  How many fucking nose picks did you get in?  Um, I'm sure at least several times, you know, if you look closely, you'll see this guy.  He's, you know, really picking, you know, digging for gold. 
[02:48:00]  I wish we could find that footage.  I would love to see more of that footage.  I'm sure it'll pop up.  Oh, yeah, no, I, um, my, so my, uh, my brother sees this, and he starts recording it on, uh, on TiVo or whatever the hell he has.  And so he recorded the entire game, so I'm sure at some point, um, I can find a way to, um, record the footage.  He's watching me actually pick my nose and doing the Cungal English, but I was actually exposed to my nipple as well, and I can be rubbing it.  You suck.  Rubbing your nipple.  Playing with your nipple.  This guy's a hoot. 
[02:48:30]  I guarantee you, and I'm major league baseball, I'll say, like, any of you have seen Justin, they'll start watching for that.  Yeah, of course.  Because others are going to try to do what you did.  I'm surprised it's 2012, and this is the first time that this, you know what I mean?  Somebody went all out.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Every once in a while, you see a goofball on a cell phone doing something.  Waving to his friends.  That guy's a pussy.  Well, are there other stadiums as much like Wrigley Field, where you're that visible right behind home plate?  Are all of them like that?  Uh, that was pretty good.  Yeah.  Fenway's a bit like that, but, um, no, I mean, the, uh, I think what was so magical about the whole thing, though, was the slow motion. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, that is, that is the greatest shot.  You're doing the one-handed, uh, straight-on jerk-off move, and you're going really fast, and then I guess they showed a slow-mo shot of that, and you see you in the background, slow motion, doing the blowjob move.  It's fucking good.  There's a fastball, Johanna.  All right, and now they do a replay of the strikeout.  Look. 
[02:49:30]  His hair's flopping.  Yes, all in slow motion.  You have an excellent technique.  It's fucking great.  How long were you doing the blowjobs, uh, before they got you out of there?  A couple minutes?  It was actually, it was, yeah, it was probably good three or four minutes, and then finally, it was one batter, and so after that, it was...  Yeah, they came to get you the fuck out of there, man.  It didn't take very long.  Holy shit, very funny, dude.  Very funny.  Thank you, thank you.  Are you getting a lot of phone calls? 
[02:50:00]  What's that?  Are you getting a lot of phone calls to talk?  Uh, yeah, I did an interview with the Jonathan Brademeyer show.  That guy sucked, man.  I mean, you can't say fuck or shit or anything like that.  Well, then fuck that shit.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  Is he on in L.A.?  I've heard that name before.  Yeah, he's not...  He's nothing, really.  So let's just say what you were doing was an obscene gesture that was...  How do you describe that?  Yeah, I made like I was double fisting some cocks.  Yeah.  You figure out how that will fly. 
[02:50:30]  Yeah.  Not playing by your stupid rules.  Yeah, it was the Ghost of Harry, Carrie, and Ron King that was blowing.  He was blowing?  That's great.  Well, now we know.  Oh, that's why you were up in the air.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Oh, now it makes total sense.  You're a fucking genius.  But more than anything, it was a symbolic affirmation regarding the Cubs' season, and  I was not too pleased with their lackluster performance this year, and so I had to show  how I truly felt about them. 
[02:51:00]  Made that ninth inning interesting.  Yeah.  Plus, with Sam Rick, it's like right there.  I'm like, you know what?  Fuck you in your right winning ways, and so I did it in a really show my love and appreciation  for them.  Well, good job, man.  That would be funny, man.  You want to plug anything, Julian?  Yeah.  Where will you be air jerking off?  Yeah, next.  No.  Actually, yeah.  If you want to, I have a music video that I directed not too long ago, a band called Wolf 
[02:51:30]  in a Spacesuit, and the song's called Amber Hand, so if you want to plug that, that's kind  of cool.  It's on YouTube?  It's on Vimeo.  Okay.  Vimeo.  Nice.  It's also on YouTube as well.  Yeah, right on.  All right.  Cool, man.  Take care, brother.  Thanks for talking to you.  Good talking to you.  Absolutely.  Take it easy, man.  Julian.  That was very funny.  Oh, my God.  Now, you know other people are going to start doing it.  I hope.  I hope it starts a fucking problem for me.  I hope it becomes a problem.  Yeah.  A problem. 
[02:52:00]  Wolf in a Spacesuit.  Amber Hand.  He directed this, huh?  Let's see.  We're checking out the video on YouTube.  What Air Jerkoff Guy directs.  What is this?  This is weird stuff.  It's a painting of some 1930s-looking woman with a space thing helmet and a bikini.  Wolf's a superhero.  Wolf is flying with her through space.  What kind of music is this?  Sam, comment?  What would you call this, Sam?  Comment?  Slow.  Slow. 
[02:52:30]  It's kind of easy to direct photographs.  You just...  All you do is you get a bunch of them.  You put it in iPhoto.  And then you just use that...  What's that effect called?  The Ken Burns effect on it.  The Ken Burns.  Thing he used with the Civil War movie.  Wait.  Now this is a different version.  Yeah.  All right.  Now this looks more like a video.  Yeah.  Director Julian, whatever.  All right.  This is it.  Some guy with either... 
[02:53:00]  Looks like Lewinsky.  After she walked out of the fucking white...  No, that's what would have happened if they would have let him finish.  Yeah.  It's like angel hair pasta on his head.  Or silly string.  Where is he?  What's in the background?  What's going on?  Someone's dancing with half a mannequin.  Got a football helmet on? 
[02:53:30]  No, a fish head?  I have no idea.  This is very strange.  That's backwards.  Should stick to blowjobs.  Sam, you don't like this?  No.  You're not digging me in.  Wait, are we listening to a different song?  Yeah.  Wow.  That kind of changes.  I guess it's all done backwards-y.  And then they play it forwards-y.  I don't think it's bad. 
[02:54:00]  What do you do to this music?  To this type of music?  What is that vibe?  No.  Gay sex?  Is it gay sex?  I'm not sure.  Yeah, that guy did a double dick blowjob, and somehow this is the gayest thing he's ever done.  Good for him. 
[02:54:30]  I kind of like it.  It's weird.  It is weird.  It's very weird.  Art rock.  Yeah.  There you go.  Right.  Whatever it's called.  I don't know.  Laurie Anderson.  All right.  Have fun.  Have you?  Oh.  You know that song by Laurie Anderson?  No.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Superman or something like that?  No.  I'm not going to play it so they know it.  Give me a little Laurie Anderson.  What's wrong with you?  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  I don't know this song.  It was sort of a hit in the 80s. 
[02:55:00]  She's a weirdo.  I don't know it either.  You don't know Laurie Anderson for real?  No.  Yeah, this.  Oh, Superman.  This.  Oh, Superman.  Remember this?  No.  Oh, this is great.  Oh, Superman.  I hate this.  I know.  That's why I want to play it.  I just hate it.  No, nothing.  It's annoying.  It was kind of a hit. 
[02:55:30]  Radio stations actually played this.  It's weird.  How do you sit in a studio and go, yeah, this is it?  Sounds like someone told a great joke.  I can't believe you guys don't know this.  One of those weird novelty songs.  Oh, John.  I'm so angry. 
[02:56:00]  I'm angry.  Shoot the scream.  Mama man.  This is like waterboarding for your ears.  Sam likes this.  I'm not home right now, but if you want to leave a message, just start talking at the sound  of the tone.  It has 630,000 views.  And a lot of greed. 
[02:56:30]  Not a lot of dislikes there, Justin.  Yeah, you're right.  Yeah.  Fast forward.  Does it pick up?  Not really.  This is your mother.  Are you there?  What the fuck is this?  How long is this?  Eight and a half minutes.  What shit?  Holy shit.  That's amazing.  Eight and a half minutes.  Look, this isn't the radio edit.  For the record, this isn't the radio edit.  Go to the radio edit, Sam, before I bite your fucking arm.  I think that...  No, this is probably it.  There isn't one.  Well, you don't know me.  I have the radio edit. 
[02:57:00]  It's a cool video, though.  Is it?  Yeah.  But I know you.  That's in Replace of the Guitar.  Jimmy's popping to it, Dan.  I like it.  Look.  I fucking hate it.  Jimmy likes it.  Look.  He's enjoying it.  I do.  He's a toe-tapper like Jim Croce, right?  Yeah.  We can stop any time.  I have no idea what this is for. 
[02:57:30]  Like, what are you doing with this music?  This is maddening.  Get this fucking guy off.  It's a girl.  I don't care who it is.  It's a girl.  Yeah, it's a lady.  She's well-respected in the art world.  Oh, of course she is.  Of course.  My fiancée, Susan.  She makes that sound going up the stairs for us because she's fat.  I imagine your genie makes this sound, too. 
[02:58:00]  Wait, I got it.  And I said, okay.  Noises.  Who is this really?  Noises.  Noises.  And the voice said.  Oof.  What did the voice say?  This is the hand.  Shut up!  This is terrible.  The hand that takes.  This is such artsy-fartsy crapola.  Thanks to fucking Uncle Anthony.  It's artsy-fartsy crapola. 
[02:58:30]  Jesus.  She's making it go with her hand.  Cool.  She should put it in her mouth.  Yes.  The hand that takes it.  It's like sex music.  If you're into fucking 12-year-olds dressed like a clown.  Right.  Who isn't?  Oh.  Sure.  Made in America.  Smoking or non-smoking. 
[02:59:00]  We're less than halfway through this song, by the way.  I know.  And nothing makes sense.  The words don't make sense.  It's supposed to be this profound shit.  But this idiot just wrote down a bunch of nonsense.  How old is this song?  This is 80s.  This goes way the fuck back.  I would guess like 82 or 30.  Oh, God.  Are you kidding?  Has she done other stuff?  I don't know.  Okay.  Now it's like I'm not as angry because it's that old. 
[02:59:30]  I thought somebody put this out recently.  But she was called brilliant for this.  It's still an asshole and it's still annoying as fuck.  And I don't think she ever did anything else that anyone...  That was a weird time.  Want to hear this part?  This part?  No.  This is rocking.  I don't want to hear any of it.  This is kind of good.  Listen.  Nice, right?  This is so bad.  This is so bad.  She insisted that she needed eight and a half minutes to... 
[03:00:00]  Kind of pompous.  She's not doing anything.  What?  She's doing nothing.  Why not make it three minutes?  It's art, Sam.  I don't like fart.  Yeah.  Good one.  Thanks.  Can we just not...  Look, at any moment you can say stop this shit.  I said stop it.  See?  See how that works?  Fuck.  You sure?  You sure?  You sure? 
[03:00:30]  I hate it.  I hate it.  What's she saying?  There's nothing being said there.  There's no message.  There's no nothing.  It's gibberish.  I think she's just kind of freestyling.  Whatever comes to her brain, man.  She's a true artist.  She's just putting it out there for your interpretation.  We were...  Yes?  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Yes, Jamie?  No.  Colin came into the cellar and was talking about Rich Voss' awful comeback. 
[03:01:00]  Somebody had said something.  Hold on a minute.  It's just a terrible comeback.  Sorry.  On Twitter.  Someone said something to Voss and he writes,  Wait.  Me 27,000 followers.  You 41.  Close.  I think I guess I only had 41 followers.  Told him.  And that was Voss' comeback. 
[03:01:30]  Told him.  Nailed him.  Hey, speaking of great music...  Ah, there you go.  Now this is good.  There you go.  This is a palate cleanser.  The Ropers theme song.  I'm obsessed with this song.  From the Ropers.  This is fucking ridiculous.  It's amazing.  It sounds goofy and wacky, doesn't it?  They get stuck in people's heads. 
[03:02:00]  And for fucking hours on Twitter, they'll be like, fuck you.  Womp womp womp.  Womp womp womp.  Womp womp.  Womp womp.  Here it goes again.  I imagine this was played by one guy with like some fucking Dr. Seuss machine.  A cymbal on his head.  Or on a drum.  Yeah, a drum between his knees.  Exactly.  What a...  The song stinks.  It's so...  It's great.  Yeah.  Speaking of great music, yes.  Yes, I was going to say, have you seen the pictures of Lady Gaga from our tour? 
[03:02:30]  Oh, yeah, no.  It's good, man.  Actually, you tweeted about it last night and then it was in the paper today.  Her ass is horrendous.  She is fat.  Is she pregnant and she just doesn't want to admit it yet?  Don't talk about my girl like that.  She's fat.  Very attractive.  I have fantasies of dating Lady Gaga.  Look.  Oh, dear.  She packed a few on.  She packed a few on.  Show the ass shot.  That's terrible.  It was in the paper today.  Look at her ass.  Look at her ass.  Let me see Sam.  Turn it this way.  Selfish.  Fucking zoom in on that ass.  Nice and muscular.  Oh, it's terrible.  Get in there and smell it. 
[03:03:00]  Now, show the old picture of her.  It should be on that same page.  I think they had like an example.  Maybe.  Keep going.  Hurry up, Sam.  No, go up.  Go up.  Go up.  Terrible person.  Go up.  Go down.  Oh, my God.  I'll just keep you doing that.  I don't care.  That is terrible.  That's a man's ass, right?  Yeah, yeah.  A fat man's ass.  That's horrendous.  It's a nice run.  Why is she doing that?  I don't know why she's in.  She obviously is gaining weight.  Is she pregnant?  She's in fishnets.  So you blow off the fishnets for a little while.  I hear she eats a lot of junk food.  You get back to the fishnets. 
[03:03:30]  And that shot is crazy.  Oh, my God.  Look at her.  She's a frump.  That's a pair.  I wouldn't have passed her, though, to just do it.  Like, to just gain weight for the press.  Just because it's funny.  To put on 50 pounds or something weird and then just lose it.  Yeah, maybe.  Oh, it's hilarious.  She lost a ton of weight.  I would respect her if it comes out.  Look at her chin.  Like, that's what my initial reaction is.  Probably she just started gaining weight because she thought that's the new thing.  Because she lost a ton of weight when her album came out.  And now everybody's talking about her because she gained a ton of weight. 
[03:04:00]  Ah, you know what, Sam?  Ah, fuck her.  But you're right.  And now she's going to relate to the people that, you know, are a little frumpier.  Right.  Beauty's skin deep, man.  It doesn't matter what you look like.  She's going to have that message.  She was born this way.  Why are you pushing your lips?  That's how I dance to this shit. 
[03:04:30]  You've got to tuck your dick between your legs and do it in front of a mirror in a cellar.  So this idiot is gaining weight on purpose to make some kind of statement like, look, it  doesn't matter.  You don't have to be in shape to be a Popeye.  Yeah, I can still throw in a break.  Hey, God, you are a disgusting fat body, Private Kyle.  Sam, I'm stupid.  That's my theory.  What's your name, fat body?  Why don't you take the music off, you rock? 
[03:05:00]  I know, right?  You're absolutely right.  Because with her doing the fishnets, showing that awful ass, that means this is well-planned.  Open your mouth.  They're paying for it.  You eat it.  Best sound clips ever.  Oh, yeah.  Are you a little maggot?  You make me want to vomit.  Yeah, she was born that way.  Oh, yeah.  What's that supposed to be? 
[03:05:30]  Some kind of shit joke?  Shit joke.  Well, oh, shit.  What's your name, fat body?  Please hit that one again.  What's your name, fat body?  Fat body.  What a great question to ask someone.  Oh, wow, her dumper's a little big there.  Oh, that's shit.  I'd still put it over my face and fucking...  Yeah.  Yeah, she's doing it on purpose.  I think she is.  She was in ridiculous shape when this album came out.  A mere, what, month ago?  You can't do that by mistake.  Right.  Yeah.  You think she just kind of maybe lost track of calories? 
[03:06:00]  No, it's time to make another dumb fake statement.  She's far too calculated.  That everyone will buy into.  And then she's going to get liposuction and then have the fat they sucked out of her made into  a suit.  And then she's going to wear her own fat suit.  Yeah, her own fat suit.  Fantastic.  A drink for the little monsters.  She's going to tuck it into limited edition albums.  Yeah.  A little bit of body fat?  Yeah.  I'm glad the college kid's doing all right. 
[03:06:30]  Kid's walking on the street in the financial district.  He gets knocked out by a fucking mattress.  What?  What?  Somebody threw a mattress out of the window?  No, man.  And the fuck, I guess the wind, you know, we've had a lot of high winds.  He's just minding his own fucking business.  Next thing you know, he's out cold on the sidewalk because a mattress from the roof hit  him.  Oops.  Like a mattress on the roof of a building got blown off the roof.  Yeah.  Look, college student knocked out by falling mattress.  Holy shit.  Lucky wasn't that safe.  And then they added insult to injury. 
[03:07:00]  They put him on the mattress when he was knocked out.  Get him comfortable.  Is this convenient?  Hey, we need to get him.  Oh, wait.  We could use the mattress.  Yeah.  So that happened, too.  Only in New York, kids.  Only in New York.  He's only been in New York for three weeks, by the way.  Like, he just moved here.  You know what I mean?  Nice.  Yeah, yeah.  They lay him on the mattress.  It was probably put on the roof because it had bed bugs.  It came from the Hotel Carter.  Wow. 
[03:07:30]  That was a good break.  That was crazy.  I can't believe that was this show.  Doesn't that seem like fucking three shows ago?  Yes.  I can't believe how neatly you just wrapped up this entire thing.  That's how it works, right?  You guys are amazing.  That means we got to go.  It came full circle.  No, you got five minutes.  No, if it doesn't get any better than that, then, you know, we wrap up, Sam.  Plus, you took an extra break, so.  You're that guy now?  What happened to you?  We're keeping track of our breaks now.  Yes.  What's wrong with you?  I want to make sure that people get their shit from us.  Opie and Anthony fell. 
[03:08:00]  They got us.  Yeah.  Jesse, where are you going to be, brother?  Not Street.  I'll be at Shitstains in Tampa.  Shitstains.  That was, Geraldo, I used to call it, like, we used to call every club Shitstains.  Shitstains, yeah.  And then one time, we have the same manager, and then one time, like, he did a newspaper  interview, and my manager told me this story that the interviewer called my manager to  follow up and go, like, I've been looking everywhere online for an address for Shitstains 
[03:08:30]  in Tampa, and I can't find it.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  That was dumbies.  Yeah.  That was pretty great.  So, Jesse's at the weekend, this weekend, Nut Street Comedy Room in Wilmington, and  he's Jesse Joyce, J-E-S-S-E, Joyce, one word on Twitter, and Nut Street, Nut has two  T's in it, dot com for tickets.  And I'll be in Columbus at the Funny Bone tomorrow, two shows, Saturday, three.  And do I have one more I want to plug?  Did we, did we, uh, we didn't talk about the Peter Jackson angle with, uh, the West Memphis 
[03:09:00]  Three, right?  He's doing that movie.  Right.  I think it's called West of Memphis or something like that?  That's a documentary with Damien.  Which one is Peter Jackson doing?  I don't, I'm going to guess that one because Peter, there's a picture of Damien and Peter  Jackson in New Zealand in his book.  And they're basically saying, uh, you know, it's Peter Jackson's goal to make sure this  guy doesn't get elected to Congress, the Arkansas prosecutor.  Oh, okay, yeah.  Um, well, the judge is now a senator, the original Judge Burnett.  And, uh, yeah, they said that there's some stuff about Terry Hobbs. 
[03:09:30]  It is West of Memphis.  Yeah, that, that's the one with, I think, that Damien, him and Jason, he, they said the  movie was called Devil's Knot or something.  That was the movie that Damien didn't like some of the dialogue or whatever.  How awful is it that they accuse you of being a fucking Satan-worshipping murderer and  your name's Damien?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, that really didn't bode well.  I believe he changed it before all this happened.  Yeah, beforehand.  It's like, maybe you should change that back.  But it was because of a saint.  There was a saint, and they asked him on the stand, did you, was it had anything to do  with any movies, right?  Like, his own attorney was asking that. 
[03:10:00]  And he goes, no, nothing.  It was a saint.  Yeah, because I don't think there's any references to Damien being evil prior to the  Omen coming out.  Right.  Which, he was alive when that came out.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  It's after the fact.  Wow.  So, yeah, Peter Jackson is all about it.  Trying to fuck up this guy's, you know, election bid there, so.  And then Lindsay Lohan ran over somebody.  Nah, she tapped someone's kneecap with her rear bumper and then just drove away, and they're  like, Lindsay Lohan involved in a hit and run!  And she probably didn't even know she hit them. 
[03:10:30]  Nah, she probably didn't know.  She's a cunt.  She is a cunt.  I'm not defending her, but I'm just saying how the press loves sensationalizing shit when,  you know, the way they have it worded, you think she just plowed down somebody in a  crosswalk and kept going with a beer out the window, waving.  I'd love to put cum in her.  Like, if she let me fuck her once and said pull out, I would just grab her ass cheeks,  fucking dig my nails in and cum in her.  As she's trying to kick away from you, she knows you're cumming in her, and you're like,  keep it, and I would whisper to her, I'm going to fatten you up, I'm going to plump you up 
[03:11:00]  like a turkey.  That's beautiful, Jim.  That's wonderful.  Yeah, fatten you up a load.  He's a romantic.  He really is a poet.  October 19th, Sunset Station in Henderson, Nevada, and then Thursday through Saturday, October  25th to 27th, I'm in Philly, Helium Comedy Club.  Good spot in Philly.  All right.  Yeah, here it's great, so let's help people come out and get up.  Yeah.  Support the kid.  Jesse Joyce, good first appearance, bro.  Hey, thanks, guys. 
[03:11:30]  We'll have you back.  That was fun.  Oh, cool.  That would be a good fucking fifth appearance, I think.  That would be a good eighth appearance, too.  Hey.  There you go.  Gotta tell you.  That's kind of you.  That's very kind.  Jimmy, have fun in Columbus.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy.  We'll see you next week.  I'll be here Monday.  I think we got Burr coming in tomorrow, David Tell, DeRosa.  Oh, is Dave here tomorrow, too?  These are all the guys that have to fucking replace you, Jim.  All right.  Look at that.  And any one of them.  No, so everybody clamors just to get in when I'm not going to be here because they want  this seat.  They probably do, yeah. 
[03:12:00]  They tap it knowingly.  This seat.  Rowan, what do you got?  We'll do it live today.  What do you got?  Hey-ho.  I'm not going to fucking listen to your pitches.  What's the pitch?  I'm out of here.  You got this, buddy.  You got three of them.  What, who?  Dennis Haysburg?  Who's that?  Who's that?  From the president from 24, Major League.  The Allstate commercial guy.  The big black dude?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's say maybe on him.  We'll take a look at some of his stuff.  Yawn.  Yeah, we'll look at his commercials.  Yeah.  That means yes.  And decide.  Who else?  Jerry Stiller? 
[03:12:30]  Yeah.  Jerry Stiller.  Yeah.  Does those bank commercials now.  He's competing with Regis with the bank commercials.  He's a legend, though.  Frank Costanza.  Come on.  Jerry Stiller.  And Christopher Lloyd.  Of course.  Who's he?  Of course.  Fucking Doc Brown?  So I say a hat trick of yeses.  No, there's two yeses in a maybe.  Two yeses in a maybe.  Yeah, don't you fucking...  Look at it, look at it all.  See, you make me do live pitches, so I just...  Roland's like, yeah, let's get said yes to everybody.  How was Louis C.K. last night?  He was good. 
[03:13:00]  He was just working on his new material.  He was working on some shit for the...  What, uh...  For October, he sold out for the...  Where's he playing?  A city center.  Must be nice to pack a place when you're just working out some new material.  Oh, dude, when I was out in LA, like, two weeks ago, he...  They announced...  He did a show at the Comedy Store.  The tickets sold out in 15 minutes.  He's huge.  Like, people waited in line for hours.  He's fucking huge.  Yeah, he's the biggest in the country.  Like...  Kevin Hart's behind...  I don't...  Kevin's pretty big, too.  But, uh, Louis is probably the hottest comedy.  He's fucking huge right now. 
[03:13:30]  Good for fucking Louis.  Remember that?  We saw the entire process with Louis.  Of course we did, sure.  From just fucking Louis making...  He put pop shit up on the web.  Yeah, I got this web.  Remember he used to come in with his computer all the time and show us new shit that he  had filmed?  Yeah, check this out.  Little scenes that, you know, ended up becoming the show, obviously.  Good promotion.  Always had the talent, but, like...  Yeah, to watch it fucking just explode like this.  Yeah.  Good for fucking Louis.  Yeah.  But he walks into the pool.  Yeah, yeah.  Walks into the pool.  Oh, right.  I forgot about that.  And he talks to the priest.  They're all promotions for Louis. 
[03:14:00]  They were such smart promotions.  I forgot about that.  Yes, absolutely.  Yeah, he used all those to pitch.  Yep.  Fucking brilliant motherfucker.  Really great.  Basically, we're saying we're really jealous, Jesse.  We're between the lines.  He's a comic.  You don't have to tell him that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All comics.  He knows.  Oh, it's great.  It's great.  I'm very happy for him, motherfucker.  I am thrilled about his success.  All fucking asshole.  All comics really respect Louis and kind of also want a fucking...  An oil truck to fucking plow into him. 
[03:14:30]  See you guys.  I'll see you guys Monday.  All right.  Later.  All right.  Have a good.  You've heard about it.  You've waited four long hours for it.  Finally, the moment is at hand.  After Opie and Anthony Live is coming up next!  Yes, indeed. 
[03:15:00]  After Opie and Anthony Live.  I would tell you to call 866-WOW-1-WOW, but I'm not sure that anybody will pick up the phones.  Why?  I think I've been a little too lax on this show, and people take for granted my kind nature.  We have a signed Tony Sarguza book. 
[03:15:30]  We have a signed Tony Sarguza book.  See?  That's something I'd like to give to somebody at some point today.  You can give them to whoever you want.  But I got a call yesterday from Bob Kelly.  Comedian Robert Kelly from the You Know What Dude podcast.  Cheat book?  Riotcast.com.  He's got a book coming out called Cheat.  I got a call from him yesterday, last night, that he called the after show yesterday, in  the beginning of it, and nobody picked up the phone. 
[03:16:00]  What's going on back there?  What's going on, Sal?  Hotline didn't ring.  What about the regular line?  I'll text him the hotline number just in case.  I'm not sure if he has.  Well, what about the regular?  He does have it, because he's called in before.  The new one?  How come people don't pick up the regular line?  I don't know, because they're waiting to switch everything over before you come on.  Switch what over?  It's the same thing.  Clean the studio out.  But you can do that while the show is on, and there's two of these interns.  Fine.  You'll have one of these guys on the phone at all times.  I mean, I don't think that's too much to ask. 
[03:16:30]  Anthony, do you?  No, I don't.  Well, then why don't you make sure, because I can't trust the leadership.  I just text him the hotline number just in case.  Okay.  But what if nobody's on the phone?  It's called another day.  Hmm?  Just called another day.  No, that's not the answer, Rowan.  That's what they do all the time.  Anthony.  Yes.  You need to take it upon yourself, because it can't all be thrown upon you.  Salvador.  Salvador.  It can't.  No, I'm talking to the interns themselves.  Salvador. 
[03:17:00]  Because that's what I always tell you interns, to go above and beyond, right?  Yes.  And part of that is not just saying, well, I'll just screen the phone calls when Eric or Sal tells me to.  From now on, if the phone's ringing during a commercial, I never understood the psychology that,  I don't know if someone told you, if a phone rings during a commercial, you pick it up,  because we're coming back from commercial, right?  Right.  So, if the phone's ringing during the commercial, you pick it up, and there's always got to be somebody on the phones, right?  Yeah, there should be.  And even if Eric is busy doing something, or Sal is busy doing something, I trust you a little more than the other interns. 
[03:17:30]  Sandy.  So.  Sandy.  I think it's Julius's name.  So, you need to make sure, it doesn't have to be you, I'm saying, but you can be like, listen, I gotta go clean up the studio.  Julie, take the phones.  Does this mean I'm getting a promotion?  Oh.  We'll see.  We'll see how you perform.  It's gonna be performance-based, if anything.  Okay.  But we'll see how you perform, but this is a good look for you.  It's a lot of responsibility.  All right.  But, that also, I mean, Sal knows, with great power comes great responsibility, because Sal was given more responsibility, and the pressure increased. 
[03:18:00]  Did it not, Sal?  A lot of, the weight of the world started falling down on your shoulders as soon as you started getting a little more pressure.  Oh, absolutely.  And it's tough.  It's tough.  But you gotta rise through it.  I'm still working on that, yeah.  We were talking to Tony Saragusa today, and I thought of you, Sal.  Do you think you were one of those participation trophy kids?  Like, you know.  Yes, he was. 
[03:18:30]  You come, just, you know, you get the pat on the back for showing up.  Uh, I mean, I think my generation was, but I wasn't in particular, though.  I mean, are you sure?  I think he was.  Yeah, I'm positive.  I mean, my generation fucking blows.  It really does.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you're a strong representation of that.  I think Rob gave him a trophy yesterday.  Rob Cross, our boss, gave Sal a trophy?  For what?  For what?  Hang in there, tough guy.  Just for showing up?  Yeah.  Oh, Sal, you can't accept stuff like that, because it's gonna make you, it's gonna, that's what's  killing your competitive spirit.  I didn't get any pat on the back from Rob yesterday. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, that was a lie, Roland?  That was a complete fabrication.  He didn't give you a trophy at all?  No trophy.  Oh, Roland, you misled me.  I'm sorry, my bad.  You misled me, Roland.  I'm sorry.  We went to go see Louis C.K. last night at Caroline's, and it really is amazing.  Like they were saying at the, uh, at the very end of the show today, Louis has gone  from a guy who, you know, he would come in, remember when, for a period, he was in  here like...  Every day.  Every day.  For four months during the divorce, or during the time. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Because he was just getting his shit together.  Now, literally, if you remember yesterday, we said at like 10.30, oh, geez, we just found  out Louis C.K. is doing a show at Caroline's, blah, blah, blah, and you had to go to the  comedy club here in the city, and go to the box office and pay cash for the two tickets,  and that's it.  Now, he sells out within minutes.  I mean, the show, and they had to add a second show last night.  11.30?  And they were both sold out.  It's on a Wednesday.  And nobody left the line when they sold out the first one. 
[03:20:00]  It's that way two hours to confirm the second show.  Really?  I think, or an hour and a half or two.  And is that just for the tickets, or for the shows?  The first show sold out, I think it was like, they said an hour and a half, until they got  Louis adding the second show, but nobody left the line, so...  So while the first show was happening, they just waited?  Oh, no, but they sold the tickets at two o'clock.  Oh, I see.  So they sold out, I mean, back to back.  It's amazing.  On a Wednesday of all time.  But I did let Louis take your pictures and he goes, enough.  Yeah, Louis doesn't like pictures, but the set was awesome. 
[03:20:30]  He was working out his stuff, he had his notebook and everything with him.  Once that becomes his solid hour-hour, I can't believe the amount of material he puts out.  I love that maybe bit.  Maybe.  No, Roland, you're not supposed to do the bits yet.  I know, but I just love that bit.  Okay.  I can't do it, I wouldn't do it justice.  No, of course not.  That's what he's afraid of.  But I would definitely, whenever he starts touring this bit, make sure you go out and see him.  So, I guess, now the phone.  Turdburglar. 
[03:21:00]  Turdburglar, you're on after Open Anthony Live.  Primetime.  Hollywood.  Sammy Sweetheart Roberts.  What's up, Turdburglar?  First off, let me just say Sal Sticks.  You don't like him?  No, no.  Nobody likes Sal.  Well, we need to have an honest and frank discussion about Evox's outrageous salary.  How much is this guy making more than you?  Well, I mean, I...  Nobody deserves to make more than prime time Hollywood Sammy Sweetheart Roberts.  I agree with that, but I would think that, Eric, you don't have to discuss numbers if that's 
[03:21:30]  not something you're comfortable with.  Would you like to discuss numbers?  No.  Okay.  Well, he doesn't want to discuss...  How much more than you?  It's significant.  We'll say that.  It's fairly significant.  Is that right, Eric?  Is that fair to say?  That's what you say.  Okay.  I mean, it's noticeable.  Oh, my God.  You are, in terms...  Have you heard of the king of all media?  Uh-huh.  Sam Roberts is the god of all media.  Wow, even better than the king.  Not a god, but a god. 
[03:22:00]  Oh, a god.  Like, maybe like the god of, like, you know, tools or something.  Hephaestus.  There was a Greek god who was just the god of tools.  That could be me.  So, you're at legend status, and Piggy Boy E-Rock, he's much, much further below you, so...  All right.  Thank you, Turr Burglar.  And let's get rid of Sal, too.  Okay.  Go fuck yourself.  Love you, kid.  Thank you very much, Turr Burglar.  Getting rid of Sal may not be a terrible thing, but E-Rock, I didn't know he was going to take such egregious shots at you. 
[03:22:30]  You're asking your ass more, that guy, or wasn't the other one Larry from Connecticut?  Well, Larry calls in from different cities all the time, because he's a trucker, so I never know where he's from.  But I like that guy better.  Did you learn anything on today's show, Eric?  Yeah, I learned that Big Bopper really didn't have any follow-up hits.  Oh, my God.  To Chantilly Lace.  And that song was really only big, because he died.  It wasn't big before he was dead, right?  It was the first song, you know, first single I guess he put out, and it was starting to get some traction, because he was touring with Big Racks. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, because he was the opener for some of these Big Racks, and it was starting to get some traction.  He died, and that's the only reason that old radio still plays that song.  And when he died, people would pick up his album and be like, wow, I can't believe this guy is dead.  This single is so catchy, and then they'd listen to the rest of the album and go...  This is all the same song.  Oh, I guess it's fine that he's dead.  He didn't have anything else to make.  His art was done being created. 
[03:23:30]  It was finished after that song.  And he had the one serious song, the serious romance song that no one gave a shit about.  Right, his producer was talking to him and telling him, we gotta have one of these.  We have to have something.  Okay, and then he tried nothing.  I think it's more of he wanted that one on the album.  Like, that was his creative input.  Oh, okay.  Everyone else was saying, no, hit that trippy bass line and do the same thing over and over.  Yeah, just change the lyrics.  Just pick the phone back up.  Just pretend you're talking on the phone again.  Well, no, I really want to show a different side of my personality. 
[03:24:00]  That was a negotiation ploy.  He had to have one song that was specifically his creation, and it was that shitty love song.  And they were like, okay, get on the plane.  Get on the plane.  Bopper.  We don't need you.  Anthony Cumia, to separate them, is texting in.  Intern Anthony needs a new name.  I can't have you berating someone with my name.  It's degrading.  All right, that is a good call.  And Anthony Cumia is a host of the show.  His name's on the wall.  So where is Intern Anthony?  He's in here.  All right, let's bring him in. 
[03:24:30]  Go back in.  Because the gauntlet has been put down.  Anthony does not want, the real Anthony does not want his name being besmirched by somebody  like Intern Anthony, who I'm trying to lead up this group of two interns, and so far is  not doing great.  What do we think for nicknames for you?  Oh, I don't know that.  Well, if you could give yourself a nickname, what would it be?  I know earlier I was referred to as Fred Armisen.  Yeah, you don't look like Fred Armisen.  That's what he said. 
[03:25:00]  Glasses.  I mean, Anthony noticed that fleetingly, I think, but who said you were Fred Armisen?  Anthony.  Yeah.  I mean, maybe in a fleeting way, but you don't really look like Fred Armisen, I don't  think.  I mean, you look...  He's a good looking guy.  Okay.  I mean, if you're attracted to Fred Armisen, that's fine.  That's not what I'm asking.  But what I'm trying to figure out is who you are, not who Fred Armisen is.  Okay.  How would you describe yourself?  Um, I'm a big, uh, I'm a big film buff. 
[03:25:30]  You are?  I like movies a lot.  Yeah.  Like, what kind of movies?  Uh...  I'm gonna take a guess.  Okay.  Jaws.  Yes.  Yes.  Right on the money.  Amazing.  Yes.  That's my favorite.  Um, so what kind of, what kind of movies do you like?  Uh, I like a lot of dramas, but definitely Jaws, Star Wars.  I like drama.  Yeah.  Like, I like, like, urban family dramas.  Like the British of Madison County?  Like, no, like Mystic River.  Oh.  Oh.  Mystic River and Catch Me If You Can't.  Well, Catch Me If You Can't.  It's not really a drama.  But you call them Jawa.  Why Jawa?  I'm like Star Wars. 
[03:26:00]  I love Jawa.  Star Wars is not a drama.  No.  Star Wars is a sci-fi movie.  Yeah, it still has drama.  I'll watch anything.  I've been collecting movies since I was like 14, so I have a huge collection.  Yeah.  What do you think, Eric?  Any idea for his nickname?  Jaws.  I don't.  He hasn't had any real personality traits that stood out that we could kind of get a nickname for.  Well, if you remember, this is the same intern that interned for Disney World, and we talked to him about that.  He did the Rock and Roller Coaster.  Did we talk about that on air?  Yeah.  We did.  I didn't know if that was one of the office conversations. 
[03:26:30]  No, no, no.  We talked about it on the air.  He worked at the Rock and Roller Coaster in Disney World, and he had to resuscitate a man.  He was on heart attack.  I did not.  That is not true.  Well, if I remember the story correctly, they put him, his first day as an intern, on heart attack duty.  Somebody did indeed have a heart attack, and he brought him back to life.  That is not true.  So maybe we should call you Angel, something like that.  Well, I like that.  It's not a true story, but sure, I like that.  House, you think?  House, yeah.  Like the doctor.  What about Hasselhoff?  The way he saves people on the beach. 
[03:27:00]  He gives him mouth-to-mouth and stuff like that.  Hasselhoff.  You know what?  Call us up, 866-WOW-1-WOW.  The person who comes up with a nickname for this intern right now that I like that fits him will get the Tony Saragusa autograph book.  Wow.  Some of my friends should call, then.  What about Jawa?  Jawa doesn't make any sense.  I like it.  If you could explain at all where you got Jawa from.  From Star Wars.  He likes Star Wars.  They're the little helpers.  Did you say Star Wars?  Yeah, I love Star Wars.  Yeah, it's like the little helpers.  But did you say you like Star Wars?  Yes.  No, they're like the little helpers. 
[03:27:30]  Like Luke goes, go get this.  And the Jawa goes, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, so so far Jawa is in the running, but I don't think that works at all.  You heard what we were saying, Troy.  Anthony Cumia, the real Anthony, doesn't want this intern Anthony being called Anthony anymore.  Yeah.  Because the listeners will think the real Anthony is less than, is being berated.  And that's not something we can have.  I have an idea.  What's that?  I think he has a little bit of a lisp, doesn't he?  So what do you think, like...  I'm saying, because who said Hasselhoff? 
[03:28:00]  I did.  I'm saying lisp Hasselhoff.  So you think his name should be lisp Hasselhoff?  It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.  That sucks.  Jawa's in the lead.  Jawa's.  What do you think, Tim and Tulsa?  Happy birthday, Sam.  Thanks.  Damien's, Damien Eccles changed his name.  His original name was Anthony, so it changed Anthony's name to Damien.  What do you think of Damien?  The omen? 
[03:28:30]  Well, you could...  Like the scary little guy in the omen?  It depends on your perspective.  It could be Damien from the omen, who was a terrible person, or it can be Damien, the  guy who lived through the West Memphis 3 debacle and has become a great person.  I think we should keep going.  Okay.  You're more on the negative side of things.  I understand.  I like Jawa.  Jawa, so...  Give me my book.  You may have won the book, Roland.  Tracy?  Yeah.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, guys.  I listen to you every morning.  You guys are awesome.  Thank you.  You bring me back to Jersey. 
[03:29:00]  I'm born and raised in Jersey, but now I'm freaking stuck in Arkansas.  That's terrible.  I'm thinking, you know...  I know.  Amen.  But, so, go Rutgers on Saturday.  Anyway, I was going to say, you know...  Whatever.  When I was in the Navy, they'd say, oh, you have such a skate job, or he has a skate  job, or whatever.  So, what about calling him skater?  Skater.  I mean, it's got a background.  Do you skate?  No, I don't...  If I skate, I'll fall miserably.  How about this?  If we call you Skater Boy, but we spell it B-O-I. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, I think so.  What do you think?  Something like that.  Something young, something fresh.  Yeah.  You know, what do you think?  Skater Boy.  Skater Boy?  With the B-O-I, though.  Skater doesn't really translate to me.  How about Movie Boy?  With B-O-I.  Well, that's my Xbox Live name.  It's Movie Man 29.  No, no, no.  Boy.  We go Boy.  By the way, Movie Man 29, everybody de-friend Movie Man 29, and maybe the worst Xbox name  ever.  That's mine.  That's what I use for everything.  If I saw...  If I was playing Xbox, and some guy was like, hey, do you want to join my game? 
[03:30:00]  My name's Movie Man 29.  You know what I'd say?  Why aren't you watching movies right now if you're such a Movie Man?  That's true.  What are you doing playing Xbox?  That's true.  You should be busy.  I know.  Okay, what do you think of Jack's suggestion?  Jack, you're on After Open Anthony Live.  Yes.  Seeing that it's about Tony's book, I think it should be called Shitstain.  What do you think of Shitstain?  Shitstain.  Yeah.  You like that, Troy?  Yeah.  Or Skidmark.  So far, you like Shitstain.  Roland, you prefer Skidmark, a little less vulgar.  Keep it more family-oriented. 
[03:30:30]  You probably know what it is.  That's fine with me.  That means I still get the book.  I think we're going to keep moving.  I don't think we're going to pass on Shitstain.  You don't like Shitstain as much?  No, no.  Pete, what do you think?  I'm thinking Chachi.  Yes.  Chachi.  What do you think of that?  Are you Italian or Hispanic?  I am Italian.  You look Hispanic.  No, I'm Italian.  Doesn't he look Hispanic?  I do get that a lot, though.  Troy, you're not his guy.  He looks a little Hispanic.  A little bit.  Yeah, but Anthony's not a Hispanic name.  Yeah, but I mean, you know, he looks like he's a Hispanic guy.  That's why Chachi might work. 
[03:31:00]  Chachi sounds Hispanic, too.  Chachi's nice.  You like Chachi?  So far, I like that one the best.  Yes, that's pretty cool.  Jeremy.  Hey, how y'all doing today?  Oh, very well, thank you.  If his favorite movie is Jaws, why don't y'all nickname him after the spoken Jaws?  Orca.  Orca?  Yes, please.  That's my car's name.  Well, I'm not going to do that, then.  How about Bruce, the shark?  Hey, did you guys notice?  Jeremy's spoken.  Thank you, Jeremy.  Oh, wow.  Thank you, guys.  That's a Pearl Jam song.  I don't know if you guys caught that.  Did you know that was a song? 
[03:31:30]  Did you know it was a song?  I don't know if the joke in context probably isn't as good as that.  I got it.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Amanda.  Amanda, you're on.  Hi, Amanda.  After opening.  Don't flirt with her.  Okay.  That gets weird.  Hey, I think you should combine Bruce with Brody and Tony and make him Browny.  Browny.  Wow.  What do you think of that?  No, Browny.  No, we go Browny because that also plays up on the fact.  A shit stain.  A shit stain.  And you look a little bit ethnic. 
[03:32:00]  Okay.  So at all angles, it covers.  Something like Browny.  As long as it's got Jaws references, I'll take it.  Although we may be accused of racism, so we can't do it.  Rick?  Yeah, how's it going?  I think Flickr would fit him nicely, especially if he's got glasses and he's skinny and maybe  a little light in the loafers.  Are you light in the loafers?  What does that mean, light in the loafers?  You know, just a little light in the loafers.  What does that mean?  I don't know what that means.  Well, you know, are you a little light in the loafers. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, no, I'm not.  No, no.  I mean, you know, you don't really walk around.  You're more like prance around a little bit.  Frolic around.  Yeah, you frolic every now and then?  No, I don't frolic.  Over the river and around the bend.  Right.  One of those type of deals.  No.  Every now and then?  No, never.  Never once.  I'm a hole in the back.  Okay, well, that's not even subtle at all, Rowan.  What was the name, though?  What was the name?  Flicker.  Flicker?  I mean, that just didn't make any sense to me.  I mean, it's just no context for it.  No.  I like Jawas.  You like Jawas? 
[03:33:00]  Jawas is still good.  People keep...  I mean, you don't have to put them on hold if they're suggesting names we already heard.  Zach, you're also suggesting Skidmark?  Yeah.  Why?  Somebody already did.  What did I do?  Chris.  Yes.  What do you think?  I think, first of all, I should automatically win it because I'm from Indianapolis.  I've been to Indianapolis.  It's not a great city.  Well, that's besides the point.  I mean, you guys got a mall, yes.  But beyond that, what else is going on, you know? 
[03:33:30]  Got Andrew Luck.  Huh?  We have Andrew Luck now.  I guess so.  We have Luck.  Anyways, I think he likes movies, so his name should be the Popcorn Kid.  Ooh.  I don't know.  Jim does the kid thing.  Ron and Fez have had the draft house.  The polo.  The guy.  Whatever they had.  They had some kind of kid.  I don't remember, but he was a good intern.  I can't give you a kid name.  Anthony is, Anthony has an observation here. 
[03:34:00]  Okay.  And this is a good observation.  I want you to know.  And this is the real Anthony, not you, who is being renamed.  You know how some interns have what it takes to talk on the air?  They do a really good job, and they come in all confident, sounding very good on the air.  Right.  He writes, he isn't that.  Okay.  He is not.  Isn't that.  So that's what Anthony, who, let's be honest.  If anybody knows on air, Anthony knows.  So that means he's a Jawa, because Jawas don't speak.  Go like this.  Booty!  Booty!  That's pretty good. 
[03:34:30]  I mean, you do a good Jawa.  I don't see your name, but you, you're on the show.  845.  Hey, what's going on?  Yeah, I got a name for the guy?  Mm-hmm.  Why don't you call that old intern, or the other one, Julie?  Why don't you call him Sandy?  And the new guy, Julie.  What if we just name them both Julie, like George Foreman did for all his kids?  You don't want him to be Julie, too?  No.  I want the other guy to be Julie, Sandy.  I want the other Julie to be Sandy.  Listen, you're not going to fucking dictate what goes on. 
[03:35:00]  This guy's like, no, here's what we're going to do from now on.  No.  No.  It's not after Open Anthony Live with some guy whose name I don't even know.  He's kind of excited.  Yeah, he was a little too excited, if you ask me, Roland.  All right.  I'm going to take one more before we move on, because I don't want, again, Anthony.  But we better get the name changed, because.  Listen, don't tell me what we better do.  No, no, I'm just saying.  I know.  I know what we better do.  Troy, you know that I know what we better do, right?  You understand that I know what's going on.  Yeah.  Sam's running the ship here.  Thank you, Troy.  Stumpy in Kentucky.  What's going on, Sam Roberts? 
[03:35:30]  How are you?  Hey, I think this guy caused the heart attack, not helped him, so we need to call him Kevorkian.  Did you cause the heart attack, dude?  Absolutely not.  Did you make a guy have a heart attack on a roller coaster?  Nope.  Absolutely not.  I think there's only, it's obvious.  Kevorkian?  Jawa is your name.  Okay.  Oh, yes.  Thank goodness.  Intern Jawa.  And Anthony will be happy with that, I believe, as well, because Jawas do not speak.  When he walks in, you go, Odie.  Yeah, you do a little Jawa.  What is it again?  Odie. 
[03:36:00]  Odie.  That's very good.  All right.  No, and it's a nice alliteration.  We have Julie and Jawa as our two interns for the Opie and Anthony show.  You can read the book to anybody now.  Yeah.  Can I have the book?  No.  Oh, man.  Get out of here, Jawa.  All right.  Oh, man.  Um, let's go with, uh, listen, Eric, I picked you randomly.  Um, I'm not going to go with your name suggestion.  Is that okay?  That's fine.  Do you want the book?  Okay.  No, I'm not going to give it to you.  Did you hear that lack of enthusiasm? 
[03:36:30]  No.  Like, do you think that's who's going to get a prize today?  Do you know who that guy is?  He's the guy who consumes.  Yeah.  Does he want it?  Oh, yeah.  Who are you comparing that to?  Nobody.  You don't know anybody in your life like that?  Everybody.  He does it.  Who?  Who more than others, though?  I don't say no.  Who are you basing that character off of?  No one.  Okay.  Eric.  What did you just whisper?  Eric.  Okay, you said it louder that time.  Eric, you heard him say your name, right?  Yeah, I heard him.  You say he's basing his character of somebody who consumes, like a prize pig. 
[03:37:00]  I didn't say a prize pig.  No, but that guy on the phone was like a prize pig.  No, he sounded like he was, eh, he probably won a lot of prizes.  Like, whatever, I'll take care of it.  And he just wants everything.  That guy does.  Right.  And he compares it to you, Iraq.  I didn't say, Eric.  How do you feel that that's the assessment?  I think that was random, but okay.  Why?  Because, dude, he's just throwing me out there because he has nothing else to say, so he's  going to throw it right at me.  I had Jawa.  That's about it.  Okay.  I mean, I think he's making an assessment that you asked for a lot of things. 
[03:37:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  You're not, Roland?  No.  Troy, you think he was, right?  Oh, yeah.  But he's not going to fess up to it.  Of course not.  Of course not.  That's Roland's M.O., isn't it?  Yeah.  All right.  Let me give it to you.  Rich?  Hey.  Hey, where are you from?  Can I get it?  Jacksonville, Florida, Sam.  Do you want a Tony Saraguso autographed book?  Is it autographed?  I would love a Tony Saraguso book.  That's what I'm looking for.  Nice.  What a radio voice.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on, Rich. 
[03:38:00]  You just won the book.  Thanks, Sam.  Congratulations.  Really.  It's a special day for Rich.  Stan, what did you learn on the show today?  I learned that Tony Saraguso, if he's on his back in the middle of the football field,  don't roll him over.  That's right.  He had to tape his ass cheek shut.  Thank you very much, Stan.  Always good to have a nice shitting story from a guest on the Opie and Anthony show.  The guy hung up.  He hung up.  He hung up.  The guy won the book and hung up.  He hung up.  He said pick another winner.  Oh, my God. 
[03:38:30]  There's only...  Do we let him give a chance to call back?  Fuck no.  No.  No.  Why would a person hang up the phone?  Listen.  That's another selfish guy.  He's like, I loved it.  And if he calls back, you tell him that he lost the prize.  He'll have to try again next time.  We have more prizes.  We always have something to give away.  There's one caller that I can always count on.  And there's one caller that I think I'd like to give the Tony Saraguso book to.  That's Larry in Virginia.  Larry, welcome to the show.  Hollywood Prime Time, Sammy Sweetheart Roberts. 
[03:39:00]  I had a suggestion for the intern nickname.  I'd call him Intern Ersatz, which is German for fake, because there ain't but one, Anthony,  on that show and any other Anthony is a pale imitation.  So hence a fake.  He's Intern Ersatz.  That's right.  Or Jawa.  Well, yeah, if he doesn't speak.  And it also is extremely telling.  I learned many things on the show today and relearned some things.  But the most important thing I learned is that, Eric, the sex bagel is fond of a turd burglar. 
[03:39:30]  How odd is that?  That's not what I said.  It's very strange, Eric.  You have to admit that that's weird.  That's not what I said.  I said I liked Larry.  I didn't like the other guy.  He loved...  No, I did not.  Yes, you did.  Don't insult Larry.  I'm not insulting Larry.  Larry, I feel...  You know what I feel like, Larry?  I feel like when Eric was sitting there talking about turd burglar, you got hosed.  You got so hosed. 
[03:40:00]  Larry, the trucking king, who comes in, he's calling in radio shows, he's driving across  the country, there's no stopping this guy, and he's getting hosed by E-Rock.  And it's like the first time you hold up on me, that damn sex bagel.  Hold up on me, Sam.  That goddamn sex bagel.  He's at it again.  That damn sex bagel.  That sex bagel.  Now, Larry, I'm going to let you make the call.  Rich just called me back.  Do you want the Terry Tony series, whatever his name is, book, or should I give it to 
[03:40:30]  Rich?  Sam, I never call the show asking for something.  And I mean never.  You sent me a prize.  I cherish the Irish Mickey Ward autograph book that you sent me, an autograph book edition.  I cherish it.  And I never call the show wanting something, other than to say, you are Hollywood primetime  Sammy Sweetheart Robert, a man with wisdom beyond his years.  A man who knew the Facebook IPO was a bust. 
[03:41:00]  I did say that.  The wisdom of a man of your young age is very, very rare, Sam.  And let's keep it on the record, too.  As of today, I'm the first person to officially say that Lady Gaga is getting fat on purpose  for publicity.  Well, it could very well be because you run on top of Bobby Ray Justin.  You have your pulse on modern pop music, Sam.  Nobody like you has your pulse on that.  My finger on the pulse.  Something like that.  Thank you very much, Larry.  Yeah, your finger on the pulse. 
[03:41:30]  What a dumbass am I?  That's what I get for not sleeping since yesterday because I cannot be stopped.  Always a pleasure.  I do have another prize if you want to give it.  Oh, what's the other prize?  The Season 2 Walking Dead Blu-ray.  What do you like better, Tony Saragusa or Walking Dead?  Who, me?  Yeah, you.  I don't have a Blu-ray player.  All right, then.  I love the book.  I read like crazy.  All right, I'm going to put you on hold, Larry.  You just won a Tony Saragusa book.  Don't Blu-ray.  Oh, gosh, but Sammy, I never call wanting something.  I know you don't, buddy.  That's my gift to you.  Sammy, thank you very much. 
[03:42:00]  You have a great day.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Don't hang up on him, Sex Bagel, you dastardly.  Rich?  What the crap?  You're giving away my book, Sam?  I already have some accent lighting over the bookshelf.  I gave it.  Bro, I gave it away.  How about the Blu-ray?  How about the Blu-ray, Sammy?  No.  What?  I mean, Rich, he called back.  He's so enthusiastic.  He's got mood lighting.  No.  I have a vase left.  How about a vase, Rich?  Can we make a deal with the vase?  What's the vase?  It's Troy's ex-girlfriend's dead mother's vase. 
[03:42:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah, I heard about the vase last week.  Love the vase.  Okay.  Last one.  Okay, Rich, you just want...  Because Troy moved, so he had to get rid of a bunch of stuff, and some of what he got  rid of was his ex-girlfriend's dead mother's vase.  I listen to the show every day, Sam.  Why are you explaining this to me?  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  So I'm going to put you on hold, and we're going to send you the vase.  Okay.  I'm ready.  All right, buddy.  Thank you.  Which, again, belonged to your ex-girlfriend's mother, who is now with debt.  She's deceased, right?  Unfortunately.  Now, did your ex-girlfriend say, hey, Troy, why don't you give these away on the air? 
[03:43:00]  No.  No?  She never said that.  No, she just up and left, and she went to fucking Germany.  So, theoretically, one day she could say, hey, you know, my mom is dead, because she  is dead, correct?  Oh, yeah.  She's in the ground.  She could, theoretically, come to you and say, hey, I'd really like those vases back  that I left here when I lived with you.  You know what I'd say?  What?  I would say, well, remember I packed up a bunch of your shit, and I sent it back to Pennsylvania  for you?  Uh-huh.  It's in there somewhere.  But that'd be a lie.  You'd know that was a lie.  That's not my problem.  Right.  And Eric could cut it up and be a puss on line. 
[03:43:30]  Would she be upset if you were like, well, I gave him away as, like, a bit on the radio.  We kind of, like, made a joke out of the fact that I was giving away my ex-girlfriend's  dead mother's vases.  She'd probably be a little upset about it, but I think I've held her dead mother in the  utmost respect.  You've never disrespected her.  She was a sweet lady.  Yeah.  She really is.  She's not anymore.  No.  She's no longer with us.  She's dead.  But she also had great vases, great taste in vases, and now Rich is going to get to 
[03:44:00]  And made a lot of people happy out there.  Join in with that.  She did.  Even after, even post-mortem.  Yeah.  I had something else, too.  I don't know if I should give it away, but...  What is it?  Because I don't even know...  I heard a rumor that you sent the punk rock gift pack that you talked about on the air.  You already sent it out to a girl.  I did.  Okay.  Well, you didn't even wait for the air for that.  Well, I was sitting here for a while.  We just never got around to it.  Okay.  And that chick, Liz, she's a big punk rock chick, so...  What's her Twitter handle? 
[03:44:30]  Liz Sets Fire.  Okay.  Now, what is the other mystery prize?  We don't have to give it away today, but tease him.  Oh, man.  Is it great?  I don't know if I should do this.  Is it great?  I just don't know if I won it.  Because I don't even know if it's real.  What is it?  Well, her...  My ex-girlfriend's dead mother...  Her mom's dead, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  She had a...  She supposedly had a guitar signed by Paul McCartney.  Really?  Yeah, but I don't know if it's...  So, maybe we'll give it away and say it's most likely fake. 
[03:45:00]  I don't know if I want to give it away.  I don't know.  I'm tempted to give it away.  Well, here's the thing.  If you don't give it away and you keep it,  then at any point your ex could come back and ask for it back.  At the very least, if you give it away, it's probably fake.  Let's be honest.  Well, I'm really annoyed...  Because I actually have a bunch of my ex-girlfriend's clothes, too.  I'm thinking about giving those away, too.  I think that'd be great.  Well, because I...  So, like, you know, we've already...  When we were going through the names a minute ago,  we established how many females are listening to the show.  Yeah.  They need clothes, too.  Yeah, but she... 
[03:45:30]  They're like, you know, higher-end shit.  What do you do?  Like gowns and shit.  Are you trying to say that the after Opie and Anthony live show  attracts a lower class of people?  No, I don't know what they would do with, you know,  evening gowns.  Go to formal events, of course.  And she was really tall, so...  There are tall people listening.  Let's give away her clothes.  All right.  Plus, I'll bet there's some dudes listening  that would dress up in your ex-girlfriend's clothes.  Well, I told her to come get her shit before I moved.  And she never did.  So I have all this stuff still that I was holding on to her for,  but I'm just thinking, 
[03:46:00]  nah, fuck it, I might give it away.  I even have, like, all her childhood photos.  Maybe that could be something we give away.  I don't know about that one.  But I do have that guitar.  I don't know if I should give it away or not.  Well, it's...  Is there any reason for you to believe it's real?  Or why don't we book, like,  the people who authenticate them,  things like Pawn Stars?  We'll bring them here to After Show.  Can you get someone like that?  Yeah, and then it'll be like a Pawn Star.  Okay, can you get someone to authenticate it?  Yeah.  If we get somebody to authenticate the guitar on the air,  if it's real, you keep it.  If it's fake, we'll give it away. 
[03:46:30]  Okay.  Is that cool?  Yeah.  You don't mind giving it away if it's definitely fake?  No.  I think it's a good guitar.  I don't even know what it is,  but it's a good guitar.  And a dead woman owned it.  Yeah.  I guess the rock historian, dude,  he values all the rock memorabilia  for the hard rocks around the world.  Right.  Okay.  I'll bring him in.  All right, yeah.  Bring him in,  and then we'll get it going.  Everybody's just...  Let's see.  What did you learn, Clint?  Hey, prime time, not Sam, Sammy Roberts. 
[03:47:00]  What's up?  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  What did I learn?  I learned that Tony Saragusa is more than willing to shove a garden hose up his ass  and maybe not even produce a raisin.  It's true.  I mean, he did shove a garden hose up his ass.  Troy, you like to shit a lot.  I do.  You went through a phase where you were taking laxatives just as a daily thing.  Sometimes I go through a phase.  Have you ever shoved garden hoses up your ass? 
[03:47:30]  No.  Listening to Tony Saragusa, were you thinking,  that's something I'd like to try?  No.  I would do a hydroclonic.  You would?  Yeah.  Just because?  Do you just like the idea of your intestines being emptied?  Yeah, I just like feeling light.  And you feel a physical difference?  Yeah.  When you evacuate your bowels like that?  I feel like my head's more clear.  I feel happier.  Eric, you have well-documented duty problems, correct? 
[03:48:00]  It's never being stuck up, though.  Oh, it's just pouring out of you.  Sometimes you just gotta go.  I guarantee his intestines are impacted with tons of shit.  Have you ever had that looked into?  Uh, no.  I haven't had intestinal stuff looked at, no.  Because, I mean, maybe...  Have you ever shoved a garden hose up your ass?  No, never.  Would you?  No.  What if it was for your health?  And you had a big game?  Uh, if the doctor said that they had to, then, you know, that's when we'll discuss it.  So you never have a problem with stoppage, you just have a problem with go-age? 
[03:48:30]  It's just always just shit pouring out of you at all times?  Um, not at all times, but, uh, yeah, I don't have the problem where you're, like, constipated.  Oh.  Eric always has a full beard going on right now, you see that?  Yeah, is that, like, a lazy beard, or are you going for something?  It's a lazy beard.  I think you should let it go.  It's getting itchy.  No, why don't you let it go, go.  Like, let it go longer than...  Remember when Opie grew that long beard?  Yeah, it was ridiculous.  You make it grow longer than his.  Then I want to see him, every day, start shaving pieces of it off. 
[03:49:00]  Yeah.  So he comes in with, like, a big handlebar mustache.  Would you do that, Eric?  Well, last time I did that, I shaved half my face off.  I didn't come in that way.  Yeah, but you just did that for, like, a second.  Took a photo with it.  That's not cool.  You gotta come in and be, like, rocking the handlebars.  Yeah.  Would you do that?  The old Steve look?  Yeah.  Keep the facial hair going, okay?  Will you do it?  I was gonna get rid of it today.  No, don't do it.  It's itchy.  Yeah, but chicks dig it, too.  You look a little more masculine.  Chicks don't dig this.  No, you look a little more masculine.  A little more rugged.  Yeah.  Nobody likes beards. 
[03:49:30]  Yes, they do.  You look a little more rugged.  Yeah, some chicks do.  Facial hair is very in style right now.  And generally speaking, you have an effeminate face.  So it helps.  It helps your look.  Nah.  Makes you very, uh, woodsy.  Yeah.  Outdoorsy.  Chicks love woodsy.  That Bear Grylls, for instance?  All kinds of pussy.  Fuck yeah.  You know what I mean?  Les Stroud, is that his name?  The survivor man?  Les has the beard.  Yeah, he just...  Bear doesn't.  Yeah, but Bear, he does other things to make up for not having a beard.  He pretends to go in the wild and stuff. 
[03:50:00]  Les, on the other hand, has a beard.  And goes in the wild.  And he dips it in everywhere.  So, I mean, that may be something you think of.  I know you don't like to be active, but you could at least have an active man's beard, right?  Maybe.  Um, Josh has a question for you, Troy.  Alright.  What's up, Josh?  Hey, Troy.  Yo.  How big are these dresses?  I don't know their sizes.  She was like 5'11", so they're long.  I'm like 5'8", 280.  What do you think?  Nah.  It ain't gonna work, bro. 
[03:50:30]  Sorry, Josh.  How about some panties I can put on my head?  Do you have panties?  I do.  Uh, I think I threw them away.  What?  Yeah.  Are you lying to me because you don't want me to try to pressure you into bringing them  on the air?  No, not because I was gonna bring them on the air.  I just didn't know what the- I don't want to save everything, you know what I mean?  It would be so great for you to give away your ex-girlfriend's panties.  I mean, that would be the scummiest-  I actually didn't know who they were.  Who they belonged to.  Oh, God.  You're just a party animal.  Wow.  I mean, I lived in this apartment for a while.  Yeah.  I had a good time in there.  Did you?  Yeah.  You had a good run in there?  I had a great run. 
[03:51:00]  You are just an animal, aren't you?  Hard to contain, Troy Kwan.  I'd like to have a good time.  Why don't you bring in some strange panties, then?  I thought about it.  Just a scummy move.  But then they're, like, partially secreted, and then I'm like-  That's the point.  Yeah, but then I'm thinking to myself, like, oh, God.  I could just see myself getting in trouble for giving away secreted panties on the air or something.  Don't mention they're secreted.  And plus, it's crusty, probably, by now.  Yeah.  It's not still wet.  You don't have to bring them in from last night.  I'm sure it's still, like, cream.  Yeah, but it's crusty.  Pussy cream.  I guess. 
[03:51:30]  Pussy cream is dried pussy cream from a stranger.  It's gross.  Not-  I mean, all one-night stands are strangers, and you're going to end up with some pussy cream somewhere.  True.  I mean, just because there's not a pussy attached to it, you can't handle a little pussy cream?  Yeah, but at least I know that they probably belong to somebody hot, but if somebody else had it that didn't know who that was, there's strange pussy cream, and it's gross.  I guess, but you see, you don't mind a little strange.  You've always said that.  No.  I mean, let's be honest.  If you don't come to Cleveland to party, what do you come for? 
[03:52:00]  That's right.  You know?  You don't mind a little man cream every now and then.  That's right, right?  No, no, no, no, no.  I don't go down that road.  You don't?  No.  No, no, no, no.  You're not bisexual?  No.  You're not?  Surprisingly, no.  I always thought you were.  You've never clarified this before.  I am not bisexual.  100% heterosexual.  Okay.  I mean, I'm not.  You seem shocked.  No, yeah, because I didn't realize.  I thought you had at least sucked a little dick before.  Never sucked a dick.  Not one.  No, I told you I bumped balls.  That's about it.  With who, Eric? 
[03:52:30]  No, no, no.  One of my buddies.  Why?  I think I said this on the air.  I don't remember.  We were just, we were, uh, deep in the chick.  And you bumped balls.  How did it feel?  So you're, are you in the ass or the vagina?  Uh, I think I was in the butt.  Okay.  Which is, I mean, I guess that is the alpha male slot, isn't it?  Well, yeah.  Well, the pussy was on the bottom.  You have to be laying on the bottom.  Right.  So.  And you don't want to do that.  No.  But then you rubbed your, how did it feel when, so you're double penetrating a girl. 
[03:53:00]  Yeah.  Treating her, I mean, objectifying her, treating her like a piece of meat.  Um.  But she was, she was totally cool with it.  I mean, I doubt that.  But.  No, she was.  She was a stripper.  She probably was cool with it at the time and has a lot of regrets in her life at this  moment.  That's not my problem.  That's not.  That's not.  Because you don't think about it.  You don't think about the way your actions affect people.  That's fine.  But.  She agreed.  She consented to it.  Right.  So legally speaking, you're not responsible for anything.  No.  But if a person has regrets, you could have a moral issue with it. 
[03:53:30]  You don't have to.  I'm not the police.  I'm sorry.  I'm not your moral company.  You're not sorry.  You're glad you had the experience.  Of course.  How did you feel, though, rubbing balls with one of your friends?  I wilted like a flower.  It did?  Yeah.  And she was like, my butt used to be full.  What happened?  Yeah.  I was like, yeah, whoa.  That was fucking weird.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was fine, though.  No, he was weirded out.  It was my old roommate.  Well, you understand that's a risk.  Like, what's that?  Rubbing balls when you're double penetrating.  Yeah, but we were trying to focus on, you know, not making that happen, but it happened, 
[03:54:00]  so you just deal with the consequences.  Yeah, I guess.  But it seems like that's something you would have in mind.  Like, this could very easily happen.  I'm all about the experience.  You're just down.  Well, you're down for whatever.  Absolutely.  That's something you've established.  Eric, you ever rub your balls on another man's balls?  No, never.  Never?  Nope.  Okay.  And it was only for a second.  It wasn't, like, a lot of friction going on.  It's like, you ever watch those pornos where dudes are sticking both their dicks in, like,  a chick's pussy?  You're like, how would you do that?  Yeah.  Like, wouldn't that bother you? 
[03:54:30]  Well, I mean, yeah.  I mean, I don't know any women that would let, that would even be able to fit two penises  in their vagina.  Yeah.  I don't know any of the, I mean, that's just not my crowd.  Yeah.  You know?  I've never, I've never had the pleasure of meeting a woman like that.  Well, you're missing out.  Am I?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, I mean, I guess I'll take your word for it.  Can you tell, like, going in, this is a woman who can hold two penises inside her at the  same time?  Well, I, we were, I was in a band, I was in a band since I was a kid. 
[03:55:00]  So, you know, naturally, if you're in a band that's sort of doing something, there's  going to be women attracted to that.  Right.  It's like having, it's like, some people have gaydar, you have gaping vagina dar.  Well, I mean, you just, they're just sluts.  You can just tell.  I understand.  I see.  Welcome to the show, Jessie May Peluso.  How are you?  How are you?  I'm late, as usual.  That's okay.  You walked in at an interesting time.  I did?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Troy was just talking about how, um, he thinks it would be weird if two guys were having sex 
[03:55:30]  with the, because he was just talking about his experience where he was double penetrating  a young lady.  This is, this is many years ago.  This cannot be the conversation I walked in on.  I swear to God, this is, yes.  No, this is many years ago.  Yes.  Um, Jessie May Peluso is here, by the way.  Um, he walked in, no, he didn't, you walked in on this.  He was in her ass.  Yes, this is what was happening.  A friend of his was in her vagina. 
[03:56:00]  Nicole, welcome to the show.  Do you know Jessie May Peluso?  Hi, how are you?  She's a comedian.  Nice to meet you.  Very successful.  Nicole.  Hi.  Anyway, Nicole, you can also be here for this then.  We're talking about penetration.  Right, because double.  Troy was double penetrating a girl.  Many years ago.  Many years ago.  With his friend.  So, one penis in each hole.  This was back in the 90s, by the way.  So your penises were touching?  No.  He said that his penis wilted because their balls brushed against each other. 
[03:56:30]  And that was it.  And I was saying, that's a risk that should have been assessed beforehand.  Like, that's obviously something that could easily happen in that situation.  I would, I mean, I would hope so.  I mean, how big, how wide is this girl?  You'd have to have some sort of skin contact.  It's true.  Did she have, like, a foot-long taint?  Well, the idea was, like,  The idea was to kind of hit it at an angle, so balls are higher.  But then you, I don't know what happened.  I guess I just got into the moment, crashed down a little further, and then.  You lost your focus.  I did.  You should have taped them.  You guys should have talked about ball tape. 
[03:57:00]  I don't know.  Or, like, stretching it back and just taping it off?  Yeah, just, like, keep, you know, keeping the bits up and away.  Stowaway, if you will.  Right.  Did you consider that?  No.  But putting the carry-on up above?  Exactly.  Or, like, a sheath, like a dental dam?  Something like that.  But put it to separate.  That's so 80s of you.  Dental dam?  Yeah, that was our 80s of you.  Somebody left one of those in my door one time.  A dental dam?  Yeah, I was living in Harlem, and I got, this is true, a folder with a dental dam and a  Wendy's job application and all of the skills the gentleman wrote out, sexual things that 
[03:57:30]  he would do to me.  Wow.  Did he know who you were?  I had no idea.  It turns out that I was living in, like, this crack den.  Turns out.  She had no idea that I was living in a crack den.  Who knew?  In Harlem.  What were you expecting?  In Harlem, 138th and Lenox.  Oh, that's a bad neighborhood.  Bad neighborhood.  Yeah.  And so he, what, had followed you home and then?  He lived in the building and left a grape-flavored dental dam, which is so appropriate.  So it was a neighbor.  It was a nice neighbor.  I mean, in Syracuse, we leave sugar and milk. 
[03:58:00]  This guy left a dental dam.  Sure.  Why not?  You're from Syracuse?  I am.  Can you hear it?  You are?  I know.  You know what?  Can I tell you something?  That's where I went to school.  Yeah, a lot of Syracuse people here.  Stop.  Am I being punk?  No, I'm really from Syracuse.  Born and raised.  Where?  Where?  I was in Fayetteville.  I went to JV.  Yeah.  I'm from the north side.  Aw, look at that.  A lot of Syracuse love.  Look at that.  But you didn't go to school there.  I mean, I didn't want to go to college.  She was a townie like me.  Yeah.  I went to a year of school and I left.  I got the heck out.  Did you start comedy right away?  I started improv for three years in Boston. 
[03:58:30]  And then when I moved here in 2005, I slowly got into the comedy industry.  Do you like stand-up, regular stand-up better than improv?  Yeah.  Improv is trying.  Because you're just always like, ah, ah, ah.  It's just hard to watch.  Can't say no.  Can't say no.  No.  Yes, and yes, and can we please stop this shit?  Yeah.  This shit's horrible.  So the other thing Troy brought up in the same context, and this blew my mind because  I've just never been in a situation even close to this.  He said, like, don't you think it's weird for guys when there's two guys putting their 
[03:59:00]  dicks into one vagina?  How does that even happen?  How does that even fit?  I said I'd never met a girl that could...  Yeah, but you've seen it in a porno, haven't you?  I don't know if I have.  That just is not...  I can't...  I've seen it in the ass.  I just can't.  So I've seen two dicks in an ass?  Massive dicks in one ass.  Yeah.  They were big?  You guys don't watch porno?  That's a massive bowl.  Well, not that kind.  I mean, that's like saw porn.  I can't get into it.  Yeah.  That's gangbang porn.  What is going on with you? 
[03:59:30]  You're watching all this like...  No, this was a long time ago.  He's a sick, sick fuck.  He is.  He's all horribly desensitized.  Nicole, have you been double penetrated?  No.  Why?  I mean, I just don't...  First of all, I don't like the guy-guy thing.  I don't know why you do.  No, it was...  Look, I was in a band, and you have sluts.  Bands do that.  Right.  And you just want to see how far you can push things.  And it was like...  The one guy was my roommate, so I was like, you know, let's go.  This sounds like fun.  This chick's a fucking slut from Detroit that came out.  You know what I mean?  Like, she drove all the way out from Detroit to Philadelphia. 
[04:00:00]  It's a road pig.  Yeah, it's like...  Just to get double penetrated by some band that nobody's really heard of.  Exactly.  She was like, you know, you'll never believe what happened last night.  I totally got double penetrated.  Something tells me it wasn't the first time, though.  No.  No.  She knew the position right away.  Oh, yeah.  Do you regret not trying to both stick your penises in one hole?  No.  Instead of using two other holes?  No, no, no, no.  See, it wasn't gay because there's that wall between the ass and the vagina. 
[04:00:30]  So it's not technically touching.  The taint.  But it was touching.  But it is thin.  Like, you ever put your...  You ever been inside a vagina and then touch through the butthole?  You can touch it real easy.  It's very scientific.  Nicole, has that happened to you?  Hi, I...  Perhaps.  I like to Google the specifics of this anatomy.  What do they call it?  The grotus?  Or the grotum or something?  The gross.  Do you enter a lot of situations, Troy, where you feel like you're kind of the only one  in the room?  Like, you're just like, hey, what am I, am I the only one?  What, is it just me?  Well, I mean, yeah, I would think that because I'm with two girls and you've never done anything. 
[04:01:00]  Like, you've probably just had straightforward sex.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  No, I mean, I've had sex before, but no, I've never...  That's the craziest thing you've done sexually.  I've never double penetrated.  I mean, have you ever fucked a chick in her ass?  No.  Okay, so, I mean, that's not even all that bad and you've never even done that.  No, but I'm asking you...  He looks too gentle for that.  He's very gentle, boy.  I am.  I'm a gentle man.  Cuddler.  Not boy.  I'm a gentle man.  Sorry, my bad.  Gentle man.  My bad.  Yeah.  Now, speaking of cuddlers, it's funny you bring that up because...  You look like a spooner to me.  You see Eric in there? 
[04:01:30]  This is where I shift off of me and onto somebody else.  E-Rock in there.  Troy once told us...  Because Troy's got all these stories, I guess, from when he was in this band.  And he once had a girl over at their little, whatever, shack apartment.  I had an apartment with a hot tub in the living room.  You're just so cool.  Did you really?  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  The double penetration tub.  Yeah.  He wasn't living with you in the projects.  No.  No.  You weren't getting dental dams swiped under your door?  No.  Eric hung out with him when he was in the band, but he was kind of a hanger-on-er type. 
[04:02:00]  And Troy had a girl over at the house, and she was getting fucked by all of the band members,  one after the other.  Oh, wow.  And Troy stands by this story that Eric, who now works for the show in there, it's just  a coincidence that our paths have crossed like this again, because this was years ago,  but that Eric went in for his turn, and he was in there for like 45 minutes.  And they went in, and they were like, what's going on?  And they walked in on Eric cuddling with her after she had been... 
[04:02:30]  Somebody's got to cuddle that girl.  She's been rammed over and over.  Yes.  Easy pass, Lane.  Yes.  Someone's got to cuddle her.  Poor thing.  Poor thing indeed.  Oh, my God.  So, um...  Where do you go from there?  Nowhere.  I'm sorry that this is what you walked in on.  I would have liked to focus more on what you've got going on.  You know what?  I like to jump into a cold lake.  What did you end up...  Did you end up holding on to the dental dam that this stranger left?  You know, I had it up until last year.  I just kept it because I thought it was the craziest thing I'd ever seen. 
[04:03:00]  What does it look like?  It's just a square sheet of like latex that you lay over a crotch and you know, or whatever.  I just don't think that would feel that good.  No, because I mean...  No, but I mean, condoms don't feel great either.  Right, right.  They're not made for pleasure.  It'd be chafey.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, some of the characters up in Harlem, I'm sure you'd want to wrap them up with something.  Did you know who the guy was that left it?  No, but he kept leaving things in my door.  Like he had this business card.  He drew a set of tits on it with an arrow, your tits, and then a mouth, my mouth. 
[04:03:30]  Very greedy.  Oh my God.  Very greedy.  My mom's like, how's the apartment?  I'm like, it's great.  Sounds charming.  Yeah.  We have to wrap up.  But if you want to come back, you can come back.  Totally, man.  Okay.  Because you didn't get...  Do you have dates or something to promote or just your Twitter?  I'll be at Caroline's, the first Wednesday in October for New York's Funniest Contest.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  Well, you can definitely come back.  I would love to.  And get some more about civil penetration.  And Nicole, what's going on with you real quick? 
[04:04:00]  Nothing.  I'm not drunk.  I just want to let everyone know I'm not drunk.  Yeah, by the way.  Look at me.  I'm not drunk.  Nobody said you were drunk.  Everybody was saying that I was drunk.  They were like tweeting me that I'm drunk.  I'm perfectly sober.  You've come to work drunk before.  Once or twice, maybe.  No, more than that.  I am perfectly sober.  Nicole...  No, no.  Still drunk from the night before.  Okay, I was like, I am.  I'm good to go.  I don't want to be falsely accused.  Nicole hosts the family-friendly Top 40 morning mashup, you know, Z100 type show.  But she's somewhat of a loose woman who parties a lot. 
[04:04:30]  I'm a very good girl.  I like that.  Look, I am perfectly sober.  I didn't even have a beer last night.  You want to know why they thought you were drunk?  Yeah, because I forgot to add the girl who tweeted that thing to me.  That was it.  She was reposting a conversation, and it looked like she was talking to herself.  Okay, well, I wasn't, and I'm sober.  She's drunk.  Lovely to meet you, fellow Syracusian.  You too.  And we'll be back with more of this tomorrow.  Best of Ron and Fez is next.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony. 
[04:05:00]  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
