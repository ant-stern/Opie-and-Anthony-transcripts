<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion of LeBron James's move to the Miami Heat and the subsequent NBA championship, debating the fairness of "super teams" and drawing comparisons to the Yankees' dominance in baseball.  Opie then shared a personal anecdote about his unsettling experience in Koreatown, followed by a disappointing meditation class he attended, contrasting it with his preferred home gym routine and his motivations for leaving the house. This transitioned into a discussion of a viral video of an elderly woman, Karen Klein, being verbally harassed by children on a bus. Initially sympathetic, the hosts' opinions shifted to expressing disgust and anger towards Klein.  This led to reminiscences about gym class and the presidential physical fitness test,  followed by a discussion of the word "retarded," sharply juxtaposed with a heartwarming story about a successful restaurant owner with Down syndrome.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Entenmann's baked goods and their pronunciation. Jim Norton was absent from this broadcast.

The next segment started with Frank Sinatra's "Summer Wind," followed by a call from William who disclosed he enjoys wearing dresses. This triggered a repetitive, nonsensical chant incorporating the word "retarded."  The conversation returned to the Miami Heat's championship, criticizing the media's focus on LeBron James at the expense of other players like Mike Miller, and contrasting LeBron's statements about hardship with his immense salary.  Mad Dog Russo's Twitter activity and personality were also discussed.  A substantial portion of this segment revisited the Karen Klein video, with the hosts' opinions evolving from sympathy to harsh criticism of Klein's interview style and the substantial donations she received.  They analyzed interview clips from Fox and Friends and Anderson Cooper, noting the editing techniques used.  The hosts' comments were frequently offensive, focusing on Klein's appearance and interview skills, culminating in them suggesting a fundraiser for the bullying students.  The segment mentioned potential future guests, Joe DeRosa and Tammy Pescatelli, briefly touched upon a positive interview with Billy Corgan, and ended with a song snippet about alcohol, a technical audio issue, and a discussion about spanking. Joe DeRosa later called in to provide a life update and thank the hosts and listeners for their support during his mother's illness.

The following segment heavily featured Joe DeRosa, who revealed he was adopted at nine days old, sparking a discussion about the emotional complexities of adoption, including potential abandonment and intimacy issues.  Numerous listeners called in with their adoption experiences, sharing stories ranging from unexpected financial payouts from biological fathers to biological parents who were heroin addicts or incarcerated. One particularly disturbing story involved a listener whose devout church-going, financially successful father refused to acknowledge her.  Other tangents included ongoing jokes about the "fat bus lady," a negative experience at a Brazilian steakhouse, a detailed critique of the steakhouse's service,  Joe DeRosa's hearing loss, Bill Burr's debt to DeRosa, and a discussion of Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn.

The penultimate segment opened with a competitive fast-food eating contest between the hosts, resulting in vomiting.  This led to a discussion about a listener's gallbladder attack after an all-you-can-eat Brazilian steakhouse experience,  followed by a rant against their boss for emailing their agent about their return after illness.  This transitioned into a broader tirade against corporate management.  Tammy Pescatelli then joined the show, discussing aging, the struggles of female comedians, and the Adam Carolla controversy, focusing on the quality of comedy rather than gender.  The conversation included crude jokes and tangents about Jerry Sandusky,  the listener's fundraiser for Karen Klein, the hosts' career frustrations, and "Breaking Bad."  Further tangents included discussions of Ken Jeong's penis and a story about a 60-year-old woman.

The final segment began with a discussion of a TV show scene featuring graphic sexual activity.  This shifted to renewed commentary on Karen Klein and her donations, followed by a shocking anecdote from one host about a comedian having sex with a developmentally disabled woman.  The conversation moved to Amy Schumer's promotional methods, evolving into a broader discussion about guest appearances and the vagueness of invitations.  Joe DeRosa discussed dealing with online hate and his strategies for managing it.  The segment concluded with commentary on a previous guest's work, a DISH Network phone read updating Klein's donation total to $481,000, and a brief chat with Jeff Dye promoting his show, "Money from Strangers." The entire broadcast was characterized by frequent use of vulgar language and offensive jokes.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice to meet you.  How did I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If you're not going to find this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sticking around.  Let's do it.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. 
[00:00:30]  This is good radio right here.  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Please remember that. 
[00:01:00]  That's what you like, isn't it?  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  What enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:30]  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Hi.  That guy has nothing to talk about now.  It was all about basketball.  He loves his basketball.  Yes.  I think he feels like he should be coaching in the NBA.  Well, I didn't see him there this morning.  There was another gentleman at the desk, at the podium, whatever he sits at.  Well, so maybe he was up.  He took a day.  Took a day.  You know, these NBA games, they start at, what, 10.30 at night or something? 
[00:02:00]  I don't even know.  Too late for me.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, is that when it started?  I'm exaggerating a little bit, but not by much.  I watched the first half.  I'm like, I got to go to bed.  Thank you, David Stern.  Why would you make these fucking games earlier?  I know the ratings were pretty good, but people are suffering.  They're like, all right, I like basketball, so I guess I'll stay up and suffer on Friday.  I don't understand a 9 o'clock start for the NBA Finals.  Well, maybe those people don't have to go to work the next day. 
[00:02:30]  You know, those people.  It's just me and Ant today, so I'll be a little more racist.  Oh, cool.  Those people.  Yeah.  I guess LeBron did it, huh?  Sorry, Cleveland.  Sorry, Cleveland.  No one's talking about you today.  No.  A lot of people feel bad for you guys today.  He knew where he had to go, I gather.  He had to go to fucking South Beach to get this done. 
[00:03:00]  South Beach, yo.  With a team that was put together, but that's the new way in the NBA.  Yeah.  A lot of people go, this isn't fair.  Well, guess what?  There's going to be six super teams in the NBA.  Six franchises will figure out how to put a team together to compete for the title now.  And the rest of the league will suck.  Isn't that the goal of having a team?  Yeah, of course.  So if they put together a team that's supposed to win a championship, why is it so resented?  I feel the same way a lot of times, except for the Yankees. 
[00:03:30]  But it's true.  So that's their goal.  I think it just goes back to how he left Klee one.  Yeah.  Which makes this one a little different for a lot of people.  I have a lot of snot today, by the way.  I feel way better.  I do, too.  But I got so much snot in me, so bear with me.  Snot factory.  Snot factory.  Yeah.  And my asshole smelled really bad last night.  I'll get into that in a second.  Oh, Jesus.  Really bad.  Ugh.  Really fucking bad.  I almost brought my underwear in. 
[00:04:00]  But then I realized Jimmy wasn't here, so I'm like, it'll just be creepy.  Like, Jimmy would appreciate my underwear smelling really bad.  Who would smell it?  I know we would have found somebody.  But then I'm thinking to myself, it's just me and Ant today.  And Ant's going to go, what the fuck?  But Jimmy would have appreciated that.  Wow.  I took a meditation class last night.  A meditation class?  I know we're all over the place, but we always get back on track. 
[00:04:30]  We'll get back to LeBron.  A meditation class?  Yeah, I'm trying to chill the fuck out.  Now that I'm getting older, I want to chill the fuck out.  You know I'm mellower.  You do know that.  Can't you do?  Yeah.  You don't want to admit it.  I don't want to admit it.  You don't want to admit it.  You want to bring back old school shit.  Nah.  But I'm more chill, and I decided to take a meditation class.  And we sat there and meditated.  What a waste of time.  That just sounds like you could do that on your own.  Yeah, well, that's what I figured out.  Yeah.  So I will do it on my own a little bit, but just sit in the room. 
[00:05:00]  I mean, I've taken yoga classes where you really do, I know people laugh at yoga and  stuff, but you really do get a fucking workout.  And these guys that think it's hilarious and think it's, you know, faggy, whatever you  want to say, I would love to see you get through an hour of yoga.  Yeah, yeah.  You'll kill yourself.  No, I wouldn't.  It's not fun.  I wouldn't think it's not a workout.  I've seen what people do.  It's, you try to hold a fucking wacky position for a while.  Oh, dude.  It's brutal.  You're just shaking.  It's fucking, yeah, you are shaking.  So you've done a little yoga.  Yeah, well, yeah, yeah. 
[00:05:30]  Actually, it's part of my workout is like a few things that I guess is considered yoga.  Yeah.  With the ball and fucking holding yourself in a certain position where you just start  shaking.  There you go.  Oxygen starved muscles.  There you go.  So I walk through, God, I will bring it all together.  I've been doing this a long time.  I walk through Koreantown.  Have you ever walked through Koreantown?  No.  In New York City?  Sounds crazy.  There's like one or two blocks where I don't think you're supposed to fucking walk on these 
[00:06:00]  sidewalks if you're white like us.  Oh, really?  No.  Dude, I didn't see one other white person.  I think there's guards at the end of the blocks or something, and I just got through  somehow.  They just know there's 38th parallel.  Something.  Yeah.  There's some right around Penn Station, man.  You go off to the side a little bit, and it's nothing but Koreans.  I never knew that.  No.  And Korean barbecues, and Korean models, and Korean karaoke joints, and Korean  whack-off joints.  It runs the gamut.  Good shit, though. 
[00:06:30]  No signs in English.  They don't want fucking Whitey there.  They don't want Round Eye there.  31st to 36th between 5th and 6th.  There you go.  See?  Wow.  It's called Koreantown.  I've lived...  Arter Town.  I've lived around New York City my entire life.  I've never seen this Koreantown before.  Did it look like you could go in a restaurant and eat something?  No.  No?  No.  A few.  Some kimchi?  Kimchi, yes.  Some kimchi.  I think that is a Korean thing, right?  It's a Korean girl.  She'll jerk you off.  Kimchi.  Oh, kimchi. 
[00:07:00]  Kimchi.  Fucking cabbage.  Then I saw, like, sexy Korean girls, like, with big boobies, which surprised me.  I don't know.  Are they the Asians that have the big boobies?  I think they are.  The Chinese, no way, right?  No.  Japanese sometimes.  Sometimes.  Koreans all the time.  Yeah.  Japanese women are usually very slender.  Korean women got a little more meat on their bones.  All right.  Because of the Korean barbecue?  Because of the kimchi.  And the kimchi.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is what I saw.  Oh, man.  That looks like fucking. 
[00:07:30]  Don't you feel like you're in Asia?  Yes.  What the fuck?  That's very Asian-looking storefronts.  It really is.  The buildings look different than any other New York buildings.  Like, they have, they have, they have, like, shops four stories high.  You know what I mean?  They look like pagodas.  Yes.  I'm like, where am I?  Am I still in New York City?  Did I go through some kind of time portal?  New York's so diverse, isn't it?  I went through a time portal.  I celebrate New York's diversity.  Do you?  Yeah.  By getting right the fuck out of here and going home.  Nah, I kind of. 
[00:08:00]  My white neighborhood.  Really?  I kind of liked it.  I'll be honest.  Diversity to shmercity.  You don't like it, huh?  I hate diversity.  That's what I saw.  Look at this weird shit.  That is weird, man.  And there's no, um, no signs in English.  And that usually means they just want fucking Korean people.  That looks like one of those levels in GTA.  Yeah.  Gotta get through with the triads.  Yeah.  Like, like, what, here, go back to that.  Like, what's in that place?  I don't know.  Yeah, like, that thing.  It's a kimchi distributor.  The place that has a exclamation point, a zero, a seven, a sort of Q, and a sort of L. 
[00:08:30]  Like, what do they sell there?  What do they sell there?  I have no idea what that's about.  Wow.  Yeah.  And I'll never go there.  Do you just walk in and hope that it's a food joint?  Yeah.  They stacked them up.  Yeah, they do.  Well, because the city only gave them four blocks to be Korean.  Right, right.  Yeah, be Korean in four fucking blocks.  Stack yourselves up in buildings, motherfucker.  Because as soon as I got to the end of the block, it was back to normal New York. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  It was weird, man.  But I had to walk through there to get to the meditation class that I'm taking.  And then I paid my 12 bucks to sit in a chair and breathe.  Yeah.  I didn't see shit.  No?  No.  And then you get these weird hippie people that talk about their experience.  And they're looking at me like, you want to talk about your experience?  And I said, I didn't see shit.  Was it?  And everyone laughed.  I was going for the joke.  But one guy's like, are you supposed to have thoughts?  Because I saw things.  And I'm rolling my eyes. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, no.  And he goes, I saw visions.  Oh, boy.  And then the lady's like, well, what did you see?  Share with the class.  But I was killing an entire class.  Well, he did talk about evil thoughts and shit.  Oh, man.  What the fuck?  Did his parole officer tell him to go to a meditation class and chill the fuck out?  I saw visions.  Not necessarily thoughts, just visions.  Well, why did you see?  I saw a tree. 
[00:10:00]  And I heard a bird.  And I wanted to say, well, fuck, the window's open.  There's probably a bird outside.  It's not a vision.  So I sat there breathing.  Breathing.  But I did leave all chilled out.  You paid a class so they could tell you to breathe?  Yeah, usually when I pay for a class, I'm sweating my balls off, right?  Yeah.  You pay to fucking work out a little bit, I'm thinking.  Yeah, I would think.  But meditation is supposed to be just sitting there.  And I would think that's something you could do yourself. 
[00:10:30]  Well, that's the whole thing.  I'm taking a class so maybe I could do it at home.  It's supposed to clear your mind.  So I could chill the fuck out and get rid of some of this irritable depression that I seem to suffer from.  Fishman says, meditation class equals court-ordered anger management.  I think.  Maybe that's what the guy is doing.  And then everyone, like, you assume you're in a place where people are peaceful to begin with.  But everyone started getting really mad because the fan was going. 
[00:11:00]  It's got to be quiet, doesn't it?  Yeah, so everyone yelled, like, can we turn off the fucking fan?  Before we start.  Everyone's all angry at the fucking meditation class.  Yes.  Can we fucking turn off the fan?  And then people are chatting outside the fucking door.  And I'm thinking to myself, if you're running some kind of meditation class,  wouldn't you make sure everything is completely quiet?  Quiet.  Because it's like a center.  It's like a yoga center.  So they're kind of aware what this is all about.  Yeah, what type of, like, the place, was it just a big room? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, a small, like, classroom kind of like.  Classroom?  Yeah, in a yoga center.  Yeah.  All right.  Would you do this?  Oh, my God, no.  Holy shit.  You've got to experience life, man.  You've got to try some different things.  No, like I said, I built an entire gym facility in my house so a trainer could come over to me  so I wouldn't have to go to a gym.  See, we're very different in a lot of ways.  I think people know that by now, finally, because forever they thought we were the same person,  which was weird to me, because we always were different. 
[00:12:00]  Got along, but always were different.  Yeah.  I have to leave my fucking house.  You don't have to leave your house.  And I know you have a really nice house.  I have a nice place, to be honest with you.  I'm very private, so I don't really show much of it.  But I need to get the fuck out all the time.  I, no, I don't need to.  And stupid Jimmy, when he goes, you know, and plays therapist Jimmy, I think he made  me aware of something that I was never aware of.  It goes back to my childhood, needing to leave the weird, dark fucking environment I was growing 
[00:12:30]  up in.  Oh, you think that's it?  And to this day, I need to just be out.  But I like it.  It does make sense.  I go out for things that I can't get at home.  Yeah.  Like when it's nice out, why the fuck am I not just out in my yard fucking laying down,  drinking a beer, fucking going to the pool?  But that's out.  That's what I mean by out.  Oh, it's out.  Yeah.  I'm not like leaving the facility.  The one thing I hate about living in New York City, I don't have outdoor space.  It drives me nuts.  I have to like just, when I want to go outside, I got to be outside with like fucking strangers. 
[00:13:00]  Right.  I pick a piece of the fucking grass out there to hang out on.  And then next thing you know, you got to hang out with weirdos and strangers you don't  even know.  Yeah.  I like blasting my fucking, my own music, you know?  Right.  So you don't have to deal with people next to you.  Just fucking outside, could drink, could do whatever the fuck I want.  And then if I want to leave the facility, it's usually, you know, go to the shooting range  or something like that.  Or go to the supermarket, pick up some burgers to barbecue.  Yeah.  Like that to me is better than going anywhere else. 
[00:13:30]  You want the New York experience?  Just imagine that beautiful outside you got, right?  Yeah.  And all of a sudden people just show up and sit next to you.  All right.  That kind of does sound like my house.  Well.  No, but I know.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Might even be some undesirables.  Undesirables, Ant.  Think about that.  Oh my goodness.  You found a nice spot outside and guess what?  Undesirables are sitting next to you because it's their space too.  We can't have any of that.  It's everyone's space.  So I ohmed my ass off. 
[00:14:00]  We had to do some ohms.  Are they still doing that?  Isn't that like hack as far as meditation goes?  It's the one word that still seems to be the number one.  That seems hack now.  You'd think they would come up with a new word.  And then we were like, and then we were envisioning the demon going up and down a pole or something.  But I guess that's your breath.  Because when the demon's not working for you, you got to keep him busy.  It's some kind of old story.  How are you supposed to breathe?  Real deep?  Or it's shallow? 
[00:14:30]  You're almost not supposed to notice your breath, but you're concentrating on your breath, if that makes sense.  So how would Big A do this?  Oh, he would be a nightmare.  Oh, he'd be a nightmare.  In a meditation class.  All right.  We're kidding.  Jesus.  So then I walked through Korean town and I decided I was in the 30s and I live on the Upper West Side.  I walked all the way home.  It took me an hour and a half.  Wow.  And it was hot.  It was fucking hot.  Blazing.  Hence, and see how I'm bringing it all together.  Hence, the really bad underwear. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, okay.  Now it makes sense.  I had crack sweat.  It starts with back sweat going down the funnel of your spine into your fucking cracks.  It's like a drip coffee maker, only with your asshole.  Yes.  So then the sweat gets into your crack and now it picks up whatever the fuck's going  on in there and then drips it right into your underwear.  I felt like I was spotting when I got home.  Oh, God damn it. 
[00:15:30]  I had moist, moist underwear.  And then, so what, but I didn't even realize it was so bad until I went to bed with my wife  and my son, who's still in bed with us.  We got to kind of deal with that soon.  Oh, no.  Because now he's having complete conversations with us.  So now it is weird.  How you doing, guys?  Right.  Can you move over?  I need more pillow.  Thank you.  Fuck is this?  And I don't know.  My wife was sort of saying how lucky we all are and, you know, and talking to my son. 
[00:16:00]  Perfect timing, but I did it on purpose.  I moved my leg to get comfortable in bed, and that's when I smelled my own asshole.  That's how bad it was.  And I had to tell everybody, including my son, who started laughing.  He gets things already.  Oh, my God.  So you...  I moved my leg.  I had pajama pants on, and I moved my leg, and that's...  I caught a whiff, and if I wasn't so tired, I would have got up and showered my ass properly.  Wait, so you... 
[00:16:30]  Properly.  I was too tired.  You smelt it and stayed there?  Come on!  Yes.  Come on!  I know.  I know.  It's not like you're alone in there.  I know.  I was too tired.  Oh, man.  And then I wanted to bring the underpants in, but then I realized Jimmy wasn't here.  See how everything's coming together?  Do you think she...  Your wife smelt it?  No.  She howled, though.  She's got a good sense of humor.  Where she left her balls off.  Yeah.  Oh.  I'll take...  I took care of it this morning properly. 
[00:17:00]  It was bad, dude.  It was...  It was soaked.  Soaked underpants.  Walking for an hour and a half.  So fucking disgusting.  Oh.  What?  You want to talk about nice shit?  No.  But wow.  I walked for...  It was an hour and 15 minute walk.  Look.  How many miles is that?  Oh, that's pretty long.  I want to guess it's two miles.  Yeah.  I mean, ballpark, it's about two and a half miles.  Two and a half miles of city walking is a lot different, by the way.  I was, right?  Yes, you're insane.  It really was two and a half miles? 
[00:17:30]  Because I want...  This is yesterday?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I want to Google map this shit.  Well, look.  From Korean town?  I'm ballparking from like, yeah, like 30th to around...  No, you got it about right.  You know.  You got it about right.  There's no reason to do that.  I did that yesterday.  Two and a half miles.  And that's about the fucking route I took.  There's no reason.  Because I checked out some body paint.  Why, man?  You just check out shit.  I checked out body painting in Times Square.  I mean, the fall or the spring, but not on the hottest day of the year.  Right.  But stupid Kenny got into my head.  Should I bring that into it?  What was he doing? 
[00:18:00]  I'm still sort of like dealing with this stupid cold or whatever the fuck I got.  I'm way better.  Walk it off.  And Kenny goes, you should do what I do.  I just work it out.  I continue...  Do you work out when you're sick?  Don't your muscles feel like they're fucking starving?  Yeah, yeah.  You try to do one rep when you're sick and you get weak immediately?  There was no working out when I was sick.  Thank you.  It wasn't going to happen.  Kenny goes, I worked out.  I don't care.  I worked out my sickness.  He's an animal.  He's an animal.  So I'm thinking to myself, you know what?  Maybe I'll walk and I'll sweat. 
[00:18:30]  And maybe I'll sweat some of this shit out.  Look, though, man.  You walked to the subway.  This is why you walk.  Yeah, you walked to the subway.  This is why you walk.  Look at this lovely creature.  I took a picture of in Times Square.  I haven't tweeted this yet.  But you got a little fucking naked body painting chick.  Oh, that one, yeah.  Wow.  Let me see that.  Yeah, this is a good one.  Oh, boy.  They usually get ugly girls.  Oh, man.  They usually get ugly girls with no boobies.  Got a nice...  For some reason, and I'm not complaining,  Jesus. 
[00:19:00]  Times Square has this exhibition that happens all the time  because I don't know what this is for,  but I see it all the time.  Girls completely naked...  Well, they are wearing panties.  Panties, yeah.  But they paint over the panties sometimes, too.  Yeah.  They used to not have panties, by the way.  Nice.  So I guess the city did get involved  because this is the first one I saw with actual panties on.  And they're, you know, topless,  and then they paint them up right in the middle of Times Square.  They're completely topless.  Pretty hot models with...  You know, she has a nice set of bees right there. 
[00:19:30]  Times fucking...  Times Square is weird, yeah.  Look, you could even Google image it yourself,  and you'll see a whole bunch of different ones.  And the guys are just, you know,  standing around taking pictures of these girls  right in the middle of Times Square.  Oh, goodness.  Look at that.  Wow.  Look at that.  That looks like the same chick.  How great is that?  That's the same.  Isn't that great?  It certainly is.  That's why I walk.  Wow.  You see shit.  Yes.  I'll tweet this. 
[00:20:00]  Man.  Later, though.  I'm fucking tired.  I'm tired from my walking.  Yeah, no shit.  That's a hike.  Two and a half miles.  You wouldn't walk two and a half miles?  On the hottest day of the year,  it was 97 degrees.  I took my dog out for a two-minute walk,  and I went back inside.  It was brutal yesterday.  I do feel a little dry.  Dude, two and a half miles.  I might need some water.  Drink some liquids.  But hence the bad-smelling ass.  Yeah, two and a half miles.  When I adjusted myself in bed last night.  That'll crank you an ass up real quick. 
[00:20:30]  So that leads us to what?  The LeBron James thing?  Oh, yeah.  Then I watched the first half,  and I'm like, I like basketball,  and this is a really interesting sports story,  but I can't stay up.  I'm too fucking tired now.  I'm your hike.  So good for LeBron James.  He suffered so much.  Yes.  I don't know.  A guy like that probably makes close to $100 million a year  if you figure out the endorsements and all.  But he suffered.  So he finally got his fucking ring.  He suffered for his craft.  Right.  Yeah, good for him. 
[00:21:00]  He's probably very happy he wasn't in Cleveland.  I'm thinking.  I don't know.  I guess.  I guess he's moved on from that.  I guess.  But, oh, it gets back to your point.  It's not fair.  You know, you explain why it is fair.  Yeah, this is what the team wants to do.  That's what they aspire to do every year  is just win a championship.  So they get the best players.  Players, you know, they all have money to deal with,  salary caps and all that crap.  Yeah.  The finances of running a team. 
[00:21:30]  I get confused by that all the time.  And they try to get the best players,  considering how much money they got.  Why wouldn't you?  Even in school, when you had to pick players,  what would you do?  You stacked your team.  The last one left was the geek.  Right.  And the fucking first pick was the best player.  Right.  You know.  I'm sure you're not allowed to pick teams that way anymore.  I bet.  Oh, I bet.  Let's just throw that out there.  I bet you're not allowed to on school property.  I guarantee that no one picks teams like that anymore in schools 
[00:22:00]  because it's cruel.  Right.  We can't do that.  Remember the stress you would feel just standing there  hoping to get picked early?  Because you knew.  I was always just one of the middle guys.  But that's fine.  I was in the middle.  Yeah, that was fine with me.  I didn't care.  Depending on the sport, I was middle guy to, you know,  I was good at basketball was my sport growing up.  Yeah.  So I would get picked for basketball.  But the other sports, I was middle guy.  I was always in the middle, never at the end,  and never first picked or anything like that.  So I was fine with mediocrity in my sporting career in high school. 
[00:22:30]  When did it get weird?  You know what I mean?  Like, all right, I didn't get picked a few times,  but when do you start getting uncomfortable?  When you start seeing out-of-shape 12-year-olds around you?  You start looking around.  Yeah, the second somebody gets picked that you know you're better than,  you're like, oh, boy, I better be next.  I was never out-of-shape 12-year-old.  Never an out-of-shape 12-year-old.  No.  But I bet you can't do that anymore.  It would be considered bullying, I'm sure. 
[00:23:00]  Right.  You know, it gives somebody a bad sense of self-worth if they're not picked.  Oh, guaranteed.  I'll imagine the shitty fucking sides there are now, though.  Yeah.  You got to deal with the fucking dumbass fucking fat kid on your team.  Yeah.  The fat kid was always last.  The one during the presidential physical fitness test couldn't get one pull-up.  I bet you they don't even do that anymore.  Oh, probably don't do that anymore.  Remember how stressful that was?  Oh, God.  They showed you everything you had to do? 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  I got to do seven fucking pull-ups.  Oh, my God.  I better be able to do them.  Holy shit, I better be able to do them.  What was it called again?  The presidential physical fitness test.  You said it.  Okay.  Presidential physical fitness test.  Yep.  And they would fucking test you.  You had to do a certain amount of push-ups, sit-ups, chin-ups, fucking, what else was there?  Oh, E-Rock.  The run.  The V-sit and reach where you had to bend over and see how far you could stretch from the sitting position.  Oh, right.  You had to touch your toes or something like that.  Yeah.  Have you ever touched your toes, E-Rock? 
[00:24:00]  He's got to see him first.  Yes, I wasn't fat until I was here.  So, there you go.  Oh, man.  Florida kept him slim.  All that humid heat growing up there.  Amazing.  Yeah, are you happy that the Miami Heat won the NBA championship?  Home town.  Miami.  To Miami, though, where you could be celebrating.  Yeah, I see what you're doing now.  You could celebrate.  It's all part of your home state.  I'm surprised you didn't take the day off to celebrate. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that test.  It was like a big thing.  You'd go into the gym.  And the gym teachers would yell at you if you couldn't do it right.  Oh, it was like fucking full metal jacket with private pile.  You mean to tell me you can't do a single pull-up?  Right.  You don't get that stupid printout.  It doesn't even have the president's signature on it.  It's just something they print out and they stamp your name on it.  Well, it was a ditto.  It was just a time killer.  Curl-ups, shuttle run, endurance run slash walk, pull-ups, and V-sit reach. 
[00:25:00]  That's it?  That's what it says on their website.  Is that current?  That's current.  Yeah, maybe it's different for you guys.  Yeah, they used to beat the shit out of us.  Back in the day, it was like fucking...  It was definitely a run.  It was Paris Island.  Yeah.  It was crazy.  I think you had a run.  Well, there's the endurance run.  Oh, you said that?  Yeah, but now it says endurance run slash walk.  Yeah, of course.  Oh, man.  You don't even have to run it?  Of course.  I guess you just have to finish it.  That's why you get kids on a bus yelling at 68-year-old fucking women who are now rich. 
[00:25:30]  That cunt.  Fuck her.  Remember yesterday how we felt really bad for her?  Yeah.  We discussed this before the show.  We hate her now.  I could give a shit about that old fucking...  We hate her.  That old bitch.  You know, the amount of bullying I take on Twitter, I should be...  I should have another fucking...  Well, I won't say.  I should be getting a big fat check today.  She's up to just about a half a mil.  Yeah.  $427,000.  She's going to cross a half a million dollars. 
[00:26:00]  It's, you know, you have these viral videos go.  I told you it's going to be a million, Ann.  I'm telling you.  Yeah.  She will hit a million by Monday.  A million bucks for having kids yell at you?  I would take that...  I would take that right now.  They didn't even touch her.  And she was fat and sweating.  Now I guess the guy who set up the page is asking for donations for himself.  Why?  I don't know.  Ah!  Because he realized, hey, look at this shit.  Oh, he's an idiot, man.  Oh, man.  That's funny because now he's like, shit, a bunch of people.  I need money too.  He should have set it up in a way where he takes his taste.  Yeah, you know. 
[00:26:30]  I learned from the mafia.  You always take your taste.  Just got to know what your fee is.  Right.  Your fee.  You always take a taste.  What's wrong with you?  You set up this whole thing.  There's some kind of administration fee you take for yourself.  Oh, my God.  You could have taken 10%.  You could have taken a nice taste.  Yeah.  You have fucking 40 Gs.  What's wrong with you?  You take your taste.  But, wow, man.  Yeah.  Now she's a star, too.  She's on everything.  Everyone feels sorry for her. 
[00:27:00]  And she's probably being praised everywhere she goes.  Like when Maury would have those freaks on and be like, you are a beautiful, beautiful girl.  Don't let anyone ever tell you different.  Now she goes on these shows and they're like, you're so sweet.  I can't understand how these children did this to you.  So she gets kudos, praise, and a shitload of cash.  And now she's bloody rich.  But you know the government will fuck her over somehow.  Oh, I can only hope.  They'll probably take 70% because of some kind of loophole in the tax system. 
[00:27:30]  Right.  There's gifting and I don't know.  Well, the tax code says when you're bullied and someone sets up an account for you and you make money, the government does take 80%.  Right.  It's in the law.  Sorry.  It's in the law that you guys voted on.  You guys voted on it.  Well, your representative voted on it.  He represented your best interest.  You would have been up for that, right?  No!  Our stupid representative.  Oh, I hate the representatives. 
[00:28:00]  Go suck a dick, representative.  They're not representing me.  Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Oh.  Oh, we were discussing that the other day, my peep, peoples.  How everyone has to, if you talk about anything gay, you have to go, oh, there's nothing wrong with that.  You feel like you have to say that now?  From the Seinfeld episode, yeah.  No, I know.  But everyone has adopted that.  No matter what gay subject you bring up, you have to say that to protect yourself against what?  I'll tell you one thing. 
[00:28:30]  The old man wouldn't have fucking wanted to hear this.  Nothing, you know, not that there's anything wrong with that.  He would have just went gay.  Meaning, you know, talking about gay.  Son of a bitch.  The gays?  No, there is something wrong with that.  Jesus Christ.  He'd show me, like, fucking, that's, there is something wrong with that.  And you don't even fucking go near that.  Wow.  That's it.  Did you have, like, a Clockwork Orange thing at your house where he kept your eyelids open  and just showed you horrific gay stuff? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, that interspersed with, like, what I'm supposed to watch, like, old John Wayne movies.  Right.  My father had all those things.  His office was, like, all those cheesy, and the John Wayne plate can be yours.  The John Wayne statue.  Yeah.  This tribute to the Duke.  He liked John Wayne, huh?  Ah!  Because he was all man, John Wayne.  What if you found out that John, you know, might have taken a couple in the shitter?  John never took any in the shitter. 
[00:29:30]  What if he did?  John Wayne was all man.  Yeah.  All man!  That's what your dad likes to think.  Yeah.  It was that.  It was all, like, fucking, you know, you'd walk into his office and for some reason there's  just a saddle on the floor.  Fucking horse saddle.  He wanted to show everyone he was all man.  He was all man.  Oh, you think maybe my dad might have had some ideas?  I'm not going down that road.  Oh, boy.  Because then, no, man.  The next thing you know, he's going to fist fight my dad and wherever the fuck they are.  Well, they're probably not there.  Purgatory.  My dad's in heaven. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah, he's in heaven.  God.  God rest his soul.  All right.  Well, they still do the presidential fitness test.  Of course they do.  I had a gym teacher that scolded our whole class because only two people passed the fitness  test.  Yeah.  Because that was his whole world.  That was.  It probably reflected badly on him if the students couldn't do well because he's, like, supposed  to whip them into shape.  I remember being in grammar school, Washington Drive, to go local out there in Centerport,  Long Island.  And our gym teacher at the time got so upset. 
[00:30:30]  We're 12 years old.  We're doing some kind of gym class nonsense.  Nonsense.  And something happened.  And like we said here, it was his whole world.  He took his stopwatch and threw it against the wall like a fastball.  And I remember it shattered.  But to this day, I don't remember why he got so upset.  He was very mad.  We're 12 years old in gym class.  What could we possibly be doing wrong?  Oh, they love just fucking ragging on you, those gym teachers. 
[00:31:00]  I know we've talked about that before, but I still cannot fucking ever forget.  I'll never forget when I used to come into class and, you know, I was fucking, you're a  kid.  So I was a dopey kid.  I was always in disarray.  Like, you know, my mom's fucking working.  No, I never had the lice.  It was back in the day before you had a shitload of foreigners in school that brought lice into  school, okay?  Yeah, I said it.  Fucking A.  Wait, you think that's where the lice came from?  Of course it is! 
[00:31:30]  Holy shit!  Never had lice in my schools.  My schools were fucking amazing in the Elwood School District.  But walk me through it.  How did they bring the lice in?  Because of how they live?  Same way they brought the bed bugs into all the hotels in the city.  Before, you know, before there were fucking everybody coming over to the city, these tourists  from out of town and students from fucking far away lands, they didn't have all these  bugs.  They brought bugs with them.  Bugs.  They'd creep up on you. 
[00:32:00]  So, yeah.  I don't know, head lice?  But I was always in disarray.  I was clean, but, you know, my clothes were a little disheveled maybe.  My hair was a fucking wreck.  It was just, because I was in a transitional phase between straight hair, and my hair started  curling up, so I didn't know what to do with it.  Right.  And it was just, it was crazy hair.  You had those waves?  Yeah, and my mom couldn't bother.  She was a working mom, so it was like, I used to dress myself and everything, and I  wear stripes and plaids, and fucking just, my shoelaces are untied, and I was just a 
[00:32:30]  disaster area.  See, that's where we're similar.  We had shitty clothes, too.  Yeah.  But I think everyone our age had shitty clothes.  Yeah.  If you remember, when we were growing up, you didn't have many places to even buy clothes.  Yeah.  You had Macy's, and you had what?  We didn't have The Gap.  We didn't have...  We had Klein's on the Square.  Yeah, some kind of, like, department store that had a clothes section.  That's all we had, really.  Sears?  Sears?  Yeah, shop at Sears for clothes. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah, there weren't no specialty shops, motherfuckers.  There was...  Yeah, sorry.  So you had crappy clothes with pads and stripes and upplads and stripes and shit.  And the gym teacher came up, and he's like, he was one of these, like, real manly gym teachers  with big mitts on them.  And he squatted down and put his hands on his knees to get to my level.  And he flicked, he, like, flicked my hair with one hand.  And he goes, look at the way you groom yourself, man. 
[00:33:30]  He literally said that.  And I remember it like it was yesterday.  And I go, look at the way you groom yourself, man.  It was mad at me because I didn't have my hair calmed.  Like, I was fucking, you know...  Right.  It was a piece of shit.  Well, you didn't watch the hygiene film strip.  I guess I was fucking, yeah.  Well, you gotta take care of your pimples.  Yeah.  And you gotta wash under your arms.  Wash.  You know, I didn't watch that film.  Where you had to wash yourself. 
[00:34:00]  Wash.  And comb your hair.  I remember they showed pimples coming in.  Johnny noticed he started getting hair on certain parts of his body.  Right.  He had to wash under his arms.  But weren't we washing already?  I remember the big deal was to wash where the hair is coming in.  Wash your ears.  You have to wash.  Clean underwear and you.  A Delco instructional film.  Oh, boy.  Maybe I should watch this.  Oh, jeez.  This is a goof.  My name is Dr. Ronald J. Pinklevall.  This is a goof.  What I'd like to talk to you about today is how you... 
[00:34:30]  Meet Jimmy Fordsworth.  That's a goof.  I'd rather see the real ones.  A parody.  Look at the way you groom yourself, man.  And I hated that guy.  You don't like him?  Yeah.  And there was a guy in gym class named Buddy Bell, his name was.  And he was like the gym teacher's fucking hero.  Buddy Bell?  He's always one of those.  Wasn't he like a baseball player?  Yeah, yeah.  There's definitely...  Maybe it's the same Buddy Bell.  I never knew, but there was Buddy Bell.  Buddy Bell?  Buddy Bell was the greatest jock since Boomer Esiason in my school. 
[00:35:00]  So he might have played for real somewhere.  I don't know.  I don't know where he went.  When was he born?  He's 60 now.  Okay, no.  I didn't go to school with Buddy Bell.  Shut up.  That's funny.  All right, so he was a few years younger than you.  All right, so you guys were in high school at the same time.  Buddy Bell.  It was elementary school.  Buddy Bell was the greatest jock ever.  And he, like the gym teacher, whenever he wanted to demonstrate stuff, he used Buddy 
[00:35:30]  Bell.  Like, all right, I'm going to show you how to block a soccer kick in the goal.  Buddy, get in the goal.  And then the gym teacher would, like, fucking choo-choo-choo-choo, you know, finesse the ball, and  then kick it.  And Buddy would do this amazing fucking leap sideways, fucking grab the ball and shit.  All right, now you do it.  Come on, Cumia.  Look at the way you groom yourself, man.  Get the ball.  It was way off. 
[00:36:00]  Buddy, show him how to do it.  Buddy Bell just showed all of us how much we sucked.  Take solace in the fact that he was probably getting raped in the shower.  You could only hope.  You think that started with Sandusky?  Oh.  Hell no.  Buddy, get in the batter's cage.  Buddy's going to show everyone how to hit a fucking baseball thrown at 95 miles an hour  by me.  Fuck.  That's what I call a little chin music first.  Now we're going to...  And then Buddy just whacks it, and I'm sitting there like...  And he did it perfectly every time, right? 
[00:36:30]  Yes, Buddy Bell knocked it out of the park every time.  Fuck, I hate Buddy Bell.  Fuck Buddy Bell.  Never met this guy, and I hate him, too.  Is that his real name?  Because we could be sued now.  No, it was Buddy Bell.  Damn it.  No one knows where you live or anything.  There are plenty of Buddy Bells.  You just described...  I don't...  Every fucking gym class had that guy.  This guy would fucking do everything perfectly.  Buddy Bell's going to show you what a three-pointer looks like.  Would you thwock?  Show him again, Buddy.  And again, and again, and again, and again.  And I can't even fucking do a layup. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, did I stinkin', Jim.  But you were okay with that.  I was fine with it.  That's the difference.  Because to watch Buddy Bell toil over a test tube and a Bunsen burner was amazing.  And that's the beauty of growing up.  You just described it.  If you suck at one thing, guess what?  Your brain is good at something.  You've got to find out what that is.  Yes.  But not nowadays.  Nowadays, everyone has to be good at everything.  Fake good at everything.  Because the teachers and everybody else are forced to basically tell the kids they're great at everything. 
[00:37:30]  That they're great at everything.  God, that's the dumbest way to raise your kids.  Build their confidence up.  I've got to find a special school.  I ain't going through that shit.  Don't call it that.  I know.  Special school.  You know, I'm watching Little Einstein with my kid.  And you know that retard really means slow in classical music?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, right.  Retard-do?  Retardo. 
[00:38:00]  So why can't we say retarded anymore?  Yeah.  Yeah, you could say retardo when you're talking about Roland.  It's retardo, but then retardissimo, I think.  Retardissimo.  Ah.  So why don't they go after the classical music people?  I don't know.  I guess they could say that.  They started that shit.  Yeah.  Retard is always...  Retard.  To retard something.  It's a little bit slow.  It's always meant to slow it down.  Pull it back a little bit. 
[00:38:30]  Retard it.  You know?  You retard the spark on your fucking...  In your car when you twist that distributor.  They had a Waterhead story on CBS this morning that fucking brought tears to my eyes.  Really?  Yeah, maybe I shouldn't present that in the way I just did, but a kid who's got the down...  Oh, got the down syndrome.  Owns his own fucking restaurant.  What?  For real.  Really?  Not like fake owns.  He really owns it.  And his parents leave him every fucking day, and he's in complete control. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, man.  And he seems like he's not in the shallow end of the down syndrome pool.  There are very...  He's sort of in the middle.  Amazing levels.  He's not in the deep end, but he's kind of like...  Not just a little taste of it.  He's got it.  He's got it pretty good.  There are profoundly retarded people.  And supposedly his restaurant's doing real well.  I think it is Tim's Place Restaurant.  Tim's Place.  Take unique approach, thanks to special owner.  And they're going to franchise.  Come on, now.  Are you going to have to have down syndrome in order to get a franchise? 
[00:39:30]  And on the menu, you could order the Tim hug.  What?  No way.  I was bawling like...  No way!  And I was bawling like an asshole.  Oh, my God.  I was bawling.  I can admit it.  No way.  I was bawling.  Literally a hug from him?  They did this for Father's Day, of course.  So they really fucking, you know, play your heartstrings.  Oh.  What a difference 26 years makes.  Hey, this man's out here.  Today, here in sunny Albuquerque, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more glowing father than Keith Harris. 
[00:40:00]  Appreciate you coming out and walking with me.  Or a more shining example of what truly great parenting can accomplish.  Oh.  Keith and his wife, Jeannie, who also have three typical boys, have raised them all with the same high expectations.  Oh, they zoomed out on the picture.  But none more.  I gotta explain what happened.  Oh, gee.  They showed a family photo.  And they slowly zoomed out from the parents and showing one kid at a time. 
[00:40:30]  It looked like the perfect family.  That's so wrong.  There it is.  Look at those two boys.  Two.  There's three.  Those two boys, I mean, they're adorable.  Right.  And then you pull out a little.  Still pulling out, pulling out, pulling out.  Ah!  Oh, no.  See, we can't do this.  It brought tears to my eyes.  Oh, did it?  I can't play both parts today.  Aw.  Well, I want to hear what he did.  This is actually a nice story.  As a result, they're all successful.  But none more successful than Tim, who not only lives on his own. 
[00:41:00]  He worked for me.  He owns his own restaurant.  Hey, guys.  Welcome to my place.  In fact, as far as we know, Tim is the only person with Down syndrome in the country who owns a restaurant.  The rating in the window is R.  That's where dads want our kids to wind up having a life.  Where they are independent, happy, secure.  Morning.  That's why Tim's dad, a small business owner himself, provided the initial investment.  I bet.  Other people do the managing and cooking.  Yeah, come up with the capital.  Tim is the front man.  Here we are.  And the genius behind it. 
[00:41:30]  You're welcome.  Tim figured out what people really want from a family restaurant is a family feel.  That's why here, love isn't just in the air.  What are you doing?  It's on the menu.  Aw.  You can actually order a free hug from Tim.  Calorie-free.  Don't order it.  Oh, it's on the menu.  Calorie-free.  He just hugs everybody.  Almost 19,000 hugs.  Almost.  What, you keep track?  Yeah, in the hug counter.  The hug counter?  I have a hug counter.  Of course, props are adding up to.  All right, he's pretty functional, this guy.  Come on. 
[00:42:00]  Let's be real.  Give me a hug.  And yet, no matter how big he gets, Tim says he will always be in debt.  I bet he's all crazy about that hug counter.  I bet he's fucking crazy.  Yeah, hold on a second.  You think he's obsessed with that?  I bet he's fucking obsessed with that goddamn hug counter.  I do hear they focus on one thing.  Like the second someone at the door is like, give me a hug, and he gives a hug.  Put it up on the counter.  Hug counter.  Another hug in.  Everyone's trying to run the restaurant, and that's all he concentrates on. 
[00:42:30]  You don't give a fuck that sales are way down because he's just pushing free hugs.  Yeah, you think he just created the restaurant just to give hugs and count them?  Do you think he's in the office with a fucking visor on going over the fucking books?  No.  He's got his own book.  Like, an accountant is sitting there deciding how much has to be spent on food and overhead  and employees and what's coming in every month, and he's there going,  had five hugs!  He's got one of those old-time calculator things. 
[00:43:00]  Another ten hugs!  Right.  The business is in deep trouble.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Trying to explain to him, look, look, we can save this.  We just got to get rid of the hug counter, please.  Yeah, the hug counter really is.  It's not doing anything for us.  Concentrate more on the business end of this.  Hug's very important.  Very important hug.  But the story made me cry.  You'll see.  You'll see the part. 
[00:43:30]  All right.  Information.  I'll go back.  See, you missed it.  Yeah, that looked a little.  Almost.  Will you keep track?  Yeah, on the hug counter.  Love the hug counter.  Of course, profits are adding up, too.  Tim even has expansion plans.  Give me a hug.  And yet, no matter how big he gets, Tim says he will always be indebted to that man who gave him his first hug.  Oh, boy.  He's my superhero and my inspiration.  He's crying.  He's crying.  So happy for you.  Happy for you, Dad. 
[00:44:00]  I don't think any one of us can imagine the time and tears that went into this moment right here.  That made it possible for Keith and Jeannie to walk away from their son and know that he will be all right with or without them.  Is the reporter crying?  Only Tim knows that, which is why this Father's Day, no father in America will be any more appreciated than his.  I love my dad so much.  Steve Hartman.  Oh.  I wish I could say that to my dad. 
[00:44:30]  I never got to say that one last time to my dad.  What are you doing?  I was trying to think of something.  Wait a minute.  What are you doing?  I came out of Dayton, Ohio with two bad brain lobes and a dreamtone restaurant.  Wow.  It's a nice thing I brought to the show.  It's very sweet.  It's a nice thing.  Of course it is. 
[00:45:00]  Nice thing.  Father's Day just passed.  Hug counter.  You think he's just constantly asking?  He talks about it all the fucking time.  After work, during work.  You think he has a hug counter t-shirt that he sells?  Oh, God.  Look how many hugs.  Everyone that comes in.  Another hug up on the board.  No one wants to hug them?  No, they're just like, come on.  They have to.  Hug.  Hug's on the menu.  You got to.  They have to because they have a tasty, what was it? 
[00:45:30]  Monto?  A Monte Cristo?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can I have the Monte Cristo?  Let me tell you about a specialist today.  Free hug.  Free hug.  Oh, yeah.  Before we get started.  Free hug.  You want the hug?  He asks.  It's all awkward.  Now you got to say yes.  Oh, man.  I'd love to go in there and just smash that hug counter with a hammer.  You just hate everything nice.  I do.  I'm terrible.  Oh, God.  Now that's a very sweet story. 
[00:46:00]  That is.  The guy's highly functional.  I don't know if that's the correct thing to say.  You know.  Yeah, man.  Yeah, he is.  You can watch the opening sequence of From Dusk Till Dawn and get that sheriff's take  on the whole thing.  It's hilarious.  Yeah, I don't know if I fucking have a potato head making my food for me.  I don't think I should be doing that. 
[00:46:30]  It's fucking hilarious, that scene.  Then he gets his brains blown out.  Another movie I got to see.  It's been a while.  It's fantastic.  Love that one.  All right.  Yeah, let's see, because I have a new breakfast today.  Wow, what are you trying today?  I went crazy on a Friday.  What are you trying today?  I don't want them getting cold.  I decided two eggs over easy, motherfucker.  Wow.  And some toast.  Wow, that sounds good.  Yeah, it's Friday, right?  Friday.  Friday.  Can we get some intimans?  Oh, man, that's crazy. 
[00:47:00]  Original?  Original what?  Chocolate donuts?  No, original what?  Just original coffee cake.  No swirls, no extra crumbs, no fucking chocolate chips in there.  What's that?  Kevin Pollack had a tough time.  Yeah, I remember last year I tried to go get some.  Why don't they just have the regular original?  It's very difficult to find.  Regular.  Ensign.  Do you pronounce the N in there?  Ensign.  Ensignmans.  Entenmans.  Ensignmans.  Entenmans.  Is it Entenmans?  There is an N in there.  Is it Entenmans?  I don't know. 
[00:47:30]  That's how it's spelled, I think.  Entenmans.  I've said Entenmans my whole life, but there's an...  Yeah, N.  See, look at that N.  Entenmans.  Ensign.  The fucking place is on Long Island.  I've grown up eating that, looking at those boxes all of my life, and I've never noticed  that the other N.  Entenmans.  Entenmans.  Entenmans.  Entenmans.  Entenmans.  Entenmans.  Entenmans.  I fucking hate words.  Stupid words.  They get in my way.  We can send someone down to the Food Emporium.  Get some Entenmans?  Get some Entenmans.  Let's try. 
[00:48:00]  And really, make sure they know, just original...  That's it.  Regular.  Don't fucking fancy it up.  Don't need to fancy it up.  No.  Now, if they don't have Entenmans, do you want a different kind of coffee cake?  Entenmans.  That's going to be in everyone's head now.  Look at that.  Do you want a Drake's coffee cake if they don't have Entenmans?  No, Drake!  That's a word where that N just doesn't need to be there.  Take it out.  Is that a last name?  I've said that many times.  That N doesn't need to be there. 
[00:48:30]  Is it?  Entenmans.  Entenmans.  Entenmans.  Oh, yeah.  William Entenman.  Immigrated to New York.  Well, idiot.  Most people, when they came to New York, they fixed up their name nice.  Yeah.  They did, though.  Shorten it up.  Make it easy.  They got rid of all that weird foreign shit and made it easy for everybody.  Yeah, right there on Ellis Island.  Right on Ellis Island.  You dropped that N.  Fix that shit right up.  Frank Sinatra was a weekly customer of his Entenman's Bakery.  Hey, give me some Entenman's Donuts, you fucking creep. 
[00:49:00]  I need some for my broad.  Hey.  What do you mean?  I need some Entenman's Donuts.  Oh, the Entenman's Donuts.  Entenman's.  Entenman's.  Sammy, you spook.  Get me some Entenman's.  You make me laugh all day.  It's so dumb.  That N's been there the whole time, though. 
[00:49:30]  Yep.  Tell me about it.  Entenman's.  We'll leave the stage.  It makes you stop pronouncing it.  Entenman's.  You have to stop.  Entenman's.  Entenman's come blowing in from across the sea.  Nothing wrong with Frank.  I know fucking Jimmy doesn't like the Frank Sinatra, man.  Who doesn't like?  Come on.  Let's do this.  Let's do a little summer wind as we go to break.  Let's do this all nice for everybody.  We'll be back. 
[00:50:00]  The summer wind came blowing in from across the sea.  It lingered there to touch your hair and walk with me. 
[00:50:30]  All summer long we sang a song and then we strolled that golden sand.  Two sweethearts and the summer wind.  Like painted kites, those days and nights, they went flying by. 
[00:51:00]  The world was new beneath the blue umbrella sky.  Then softer than a piper man.  One day it called to you. 
[00:51:30]  I lost you.  I lost you.  I lost you to the summer wind.  The autumn wind and the winter winds.  And I lost you to the summer wind.  They have come and gone.  And still the days, those lonely days, they go on and on. 
[00:52:00]  And guess who sighs his lullabies  Through nights that never end  My fickle friend  The summer wind  The summer wind  Warm summer wind 
[00:52:30]  The summer wind  The O.P. Anthony Channel  What's that?  On Sirius XM  Hi, who's this?  My name is William  And I like to wear dresses  R  S  E  Goodness gracious  T 
[00:53:00]  Yeah!  A  Oosh  R  D  T  Retard  Retard  Yeah! Woo!  Be retarded  Be retarded  Be retarded  Be retarded  Stop your hands and clap your feet  Retardation can't be big  You know  You know  You know  You know we retarded  T  R  T  R  T  Retard 
[00:53:30]  Yeah! Woo!  My name is William  And I like to wear dresses  I like to sing, man.  I'll sing a little bit.  Everyone's watching to see what he will do.  Everyone's looking at you.  Oh, everyone's wondering, will you come out tonight? 
[00:54:00]  Hey, everyone's trying to get it right out.  Everyone's working for the weekend.  Everyone's working on the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend.  Everybody's working for the weekend. 
[00:54:30]  You want a piece of my heart?  Yeah, this is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  As the shot clock is turned off, the Miami Heat are once again NBA champions.  LeBron James captures that elusive title he's so desperately coveted.  You know what pisses me off about that? 
[00:55:00]  There are a lot of other guys on the team.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And none of those guys, they're completely overshadowed in the end.  Fuck, man.  Mike Miller killed them last night.  Mike Miller's a three-point shooter there, Ant.  Yeah?  Specialist.  Came off the bench.  I think he scored 23 points last night.  Is he as good as Buddy Bell?  Buddy fucking Bell.  Fucking prick.  But everyone will just be talking about, you know, LeBron James finally getting his title. 
[00:55:30]  Barely acknowledge anyone else on the team.  Even Dwayne Wade and that stupid dinosaur will have to take a backseat to this whole thing.  Another dinosaur.  Dinosaur head.  Chris Bosh.  In light of everything you've been through in the last two years, what is this moment like for you?  It means everything.  You know, I made a difficult decision to leave Cleveland, but I understood what my future was about. 
[00:56:00]  And I understood that coming to Miami and being a part of this organization and being able to put together this team,  and I knew we had a bright future, and, you know, this is a dream come true for me.  I've been through a lot the last two years, but, you know, this is definitely the way that it pays off.  Been through a lot.  And we've got to give him full credit.  Before the show this morning, we were watching MSNBC, and Mike Barnacle was on.  I guess he's a drunk or something.  I don't know.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  Well, he talks about how he drinks a lot.  I don't know.  He does.  I don't know if he's a drunk.  It's like that running joke thing.  But he had a real moment on TV, which is so weird when it happens.  He actually stopped that clip and goes, been through a lot.  These guys, and with the heavy Boston accent, which I can't do, these guys make $30 million a year.  Yeah.  What do you mean been through a lot?  Been through a lot.  A lot.  Been through a lot.  A lot.  You make $30 million a year.  Yeah.  Yeah, I don't think you could be through a lot if you're making $30 million a year. 
[00:57:00]  So, there you go.  Congratulations to King James.  Yeah.  I personally don't like him that much, but, you know.  Gotta give him credit.  Gotta give him credit.  Well, you gotta give him a lot of credit, Dan.  I enjoyed...  Oh, yes?  Yes.  I follow Mad Dog on Twitter.  Yeah.  And he writes, you know, gotta give him credit.  Oh, he does.  All the time.  I read every single one of his tweets in his voice. 
[00:57:30]  He's giving a lot of people a lot of credit.  I love him, but he's great.  He's a strange man.  That was mine.  He is so strange.  Gives you big hugs when he sees you.  Yeah.  But his tight fucking slacks that are pulled up a little high.  Hard handshake he's got.  I don't know what the fuck's going on with him.  Yeah.  He's exhausting to be around.  I did...  He's high energy all the time.  All the time.  He walks in at 8 in the morning and he's on.  That's how he starts.  Hey, look who it is. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, look who it is.  How you doing, guys?  Great to see you.  Have a good one.  What are you doing?  Staying a little late for a meeting?  Yeah, we are.  There was some big sports story and I gave my opinion and he went from that high energy  to, oh, that's good.  That's...  He just lowers it.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  But very like...  That's good.  He was in the moment.  Oh, yeah.  In the moment.  Yeah, he does.  Oh, that's good.  He takes it down.  Takes it down.  And then it's back up.  That's very good.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Everything going okay? 
[00:58:30]  They're tweeting you good?  I hate this fucking place like you.  Yeah.  I don't understand what they're doing around here.  He fucking rules.  I wish I could do...  Oh, you are.  That's pretty much all there is to it.  All right.  Yeah.  Just turn your R's into V's.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  And then just...  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Yeah.  See, look.  LeBron James leads Heat to victory.  He did have an amazing finals. 
[00:59:00]  Absolutely.  But what about the other guys?  No one cares.  Mike Miller beat Oklahoma last night with his three-pointers.  Doesn't even matter.  It's all about LeBron.  And who's the other guy?  Batier.  Something like that.  Huh?  I think his name's Entenman.  I like to see that on the back of a jersey.  And Entenman's, Entenman's, goes...  Yeah, the three-pointer.  What I did last night that had to do with the game?  Yeah.  After it was over. 
[00:59:30]  You were still up when it was over?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  How the fuck do you do that?  Because I sleep during the day.  I sleep during the day.  I'm jealous.  You gotta nap when you get home right from here.  I go, the second my car pulls into that driveway, you can guarantee I am asleep within 15 minutes.  Yeah, that's great.  From pulling into my driveway, asleep...  I'm too busy walking the streets in New York when it's 97 degrees out.  Brewing your asshole. 
[01:00:00]  I like the coffee drip analogy.  Yes, it's a drip filter.  God, I wish Jimmy was here today.  He would have appreciated my underwear.  Oh, he certainly would.  Fuck.  I was gonna bag that shit and bring it in.  Yeah.  Anyway, what'd you do after the game?  Oh, after the game, I decided to use one of the apps I have on my phone.  Uh, the police scanner app and punch up Miami.  Oh, wow.  And see if there were any shenanigans going on.  And there were a few shenanigans.  Nothing big that is newsworthy, riot worthy.  But it was pretty funny. 
[01:00:30]  You're hearing like, uh, some of the, some of the calls that were kind of...  14.02.  14.02.  Uh, yeah, there's a, um, a gentleman, uh, jumping on an automobile.  Black male.  Wearing a, uh, red, uh, shirt and, uh, blue jeans.  Roger, my action man.  All night long.  That's great.  That's it.  Uh, yeah, we've got a fire.  Call for a fire.  A car fire. 
[01:01:00]  All right, I'll take that one.  That's all night.  That's better than any TV show you can watch.  It was fucking cool as shit.  I actually fell asleep to it.  I just popped the iPhone up on my, uh, night table and just left it on.  And I was listening to like cool fucking calls.  There were a few people going a little crazy.  Little crazy.  A lot of, um, a little, a few gunfire incidents.  Uh, some domestics.  I guess people were getting a little drunk and rowdy.  Groups of roving teens. 
[01:01:30]  It was fun.  It brings back the old story, but I, I don't mind doing this whole bit again.  What's that?  The, uh, scanner?  Oh, God.  We used to go over ants and Ashlyn and just sit around and drink beers and listen to the  police scanner.  Listen to the scanner.  And holy fuck, did we hear some great shit.  Yeah.  Remember the guy that got caught cheating?  Oh, was that one great.  And he was just crying his eyes out trying to save his marriage?  I know, I know, I know, I know.  That was when the scanners would pick up phones. 
[01:02:00]  Right.  We'd pick up either.  Are they not anymore, really?  Not really.  I didn't know that.  They kind of figured that out.  They, they'd pick up the, um, wireless phones that people had in their house.  Because it was such new technology, right?  Yeah.  And then they'd also pick up cell phones.  Early cell phones.  Yep.  They'd pick up cell phones.  So we would get conversations of these people just that were around the neighborhood.  It was amazing.  For the wireless.  Because I was in an apartment complex.  So the wireless phones that were in your house, I'd get all those.  And then the cell phones I'd get if people were in the general area. 
[01:02:30]  It was amazing.  Remember some of the shit?  Fucking great.  Remember the one we got really scared because we didn't know what the fuck the guy was up  to?  Shenanigans.  It sounded like he was doing maybe a little, uh, job, if you know what I mean, for somebody.  There were a lot of those things.  The, one of the best fucking times though was, uh, the interactive one.  Yeah, of course.  Where we realized that the person on the phone was right downstairs from me.  Right.  They were the apartment right below me and we were listening to her phone call.  Right.  So we started making it interactive and, and we started like throwing things at her slider. 
[01:03:00]  Right.  Because I could go out on my patio and lean over it a little and toss change and it would  hit her sliding glass door.  So she was on the phone and we're listening and we start doing that and she goes, I'm hearing  something at my door.  Well, I got to stop you for a second.  A little, just back up slightly.  It was a guy trying to get a little bootay.  Right.  He was going to make a, uh, he was trying to make a booty call and she's like, she was  all, she, she wasn't interested. 
[01:03:30]  No.  So, so we, we started just, uh, uh, making noises at her door.  Well, we started with stomping.  Yeah.  And then you got to hear what she thought of you guys, which was hilarious.  Fucking people upstairs having a party again.  All they do is party upstairs.  All I hear is them banging around.  They jump, they walk around like they got cement on their feet.  So next thing you know, we're jumping up and down as hard as we can.  She goes, I can't take this.  And then didn't, uh, didn't Jay go down to the door, knock on our front door and run 
[01:04:00]  away.  There's someone knocking at the door.  Hold on.  There's no one there.  I'm really scared.  I don't know what's going on.  And then you started throwing rocks.  Throwing rocks at her door.  So he's throwing rocks at my window.  It was interactive.  And then, you know, I guess we don't have to do the whole story, but long story short,  next thing you know, this woman is begging the guy that she didn't want to come over  to come over.  So we definitely got a guy laid that night.  Yes, exactly.  God, that was fun. 
[01:04:30]  I didn't realize you can't pick up the cell phones anymore.  Uh, no, no, they fucking changed that whole thing.  The frequency, it was all analog too.  And, uh, now it's digital, all the phones.  So it's harder to pick up with a scanner like that.  Right, right.  Yeah.  But it was fun while it lasted.  Yeah.  We heard that, that guy and his wife caught him cheating and, uh, they were going to break  up and he's just started crying on the phone, cracking up.  I was like, and you cheated on me.  And he's like, I know, I know, I know. 
[01:05:00]  I never forget that line.  We were rolling laughing.  That is a perfect impression.  You're not, you're not overdoing it at all.  That's exactly how the guy sounded.  And now you're going to have to, you're going to have to now live with what you did to me  and our family.  Yeah.  I know, I know, I know.  Just a blubbering idiot.  And then there was another one that a woman that was talking about how she was having an  anxiety attack and, uh, I don't remember this one. 
[01:05:30]  And yeah, she talked about how she was driving, having an anxiety attack and had to go to the  bathroom and the husband's trying to calm her down.  And she's like, I can't calm down.  Oh my God, it's coming out.  It's coming out.  She's talking, she was turtling as she's driving home.  Wow, this is hilarious.  But you got to listen to police scanners.  Those are still cool to listen to, I guess.  Yeah.  Well, with the, uh, with the apps on the iPhone, it's amazing. 
[01:06:00]  You could just pull up any city in the country, in the world, really.  Right.  So you just find, you know, there's certain ones I have favorited, uh, uh, in Los Angeles.  You got to go with the sheriff's department and, um, New York.  I usually go with the precincts in, uh, in Harlem and the Bronx where there's a little  action and places like that.  You know, there's a common denominator.  You ever do your local?  Yeah.  That would, I think that would be, uh, the most fun.  Oh, it's great.  Here's what I hear.  Nothing, huh? 
[01:06:30]  Not even a cat in a tree?  Yeah.  Cat in a tree.  Oh, it's a black cat.  Forget it.  Kitten, I should have said, I guess.  A little cat.  No one gives a fuck if a cat's in a tree but a kitten.  I am still, uh, pretty crazy, uh, with the goddamn, uh, cat videos.  Of course. 
[01:07:00]  I, I, but it's such a, you know, everybody says such a faggy thing to, to look at.  There was one, it's like Munchkin is screaming very loud or something.  Munchkin, something about little Munchkin talking.  Oh, Munchkin talking.  Is that it?  Munchkin kitten right there?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, yeah.  Turn.  It's just.  It's adorable.  He's just walking around. 
[01:07:30]  The camera's at, like, floor level.  Walking in front of a little Munchkin.  And he's just meowing.  Oh!  No!  I don't.  Why do I try so hard on my videos?  This has four million views!  Four million views!  And it's.  And nothing's going on!  It's just a kitten doing what a kitten does.  Walking around and meowing.  Okay.  Is that thing adorable?  Look at him!  Ah! 
[01:08:00]  Ah!  Ah!  That's all it does?  That's it!  Four million views and no dislikes.  It's the cutest thing in the world.  What's wrong with people?  Little Munchkin.  We gotta do a kitten video day, I'm telling you.  Ah, we have to.  I'm telling you.  Just kittens here on the show.  We'll hold them.  Well, we gotta, like, make this look like it could be a home, though.  Yeah.  Radio station videos don't do well.  Because people go, oh, it's from a radio station.  But we gotta, we could put little cat toys on the floor and stuff. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, we could set up some shit.  A little scratching pose.  Could we take up the fishbowl?  Oh.  Bring a whole bunch of kittens?  Just load the whole thing up with kittens to try to get a great video.  And just weird kitten shit, like cups and stuff.  Yeah.  Whatever the fuck they like.  And a lot of camera angles that are very low to the floor.  Right.  With the kitten's face right in the camera.  Right.  Oh my god, look at this thing.  Let's do a kitten video.  Three and a half million.  Three and a half, 3.6 million fucking views.  Just because the kitten is a little confused? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah.  Jesus.  It's playing with a little fucking toy and it's looking cute and fluffy.  That's it, huh?  Kitten videos are what fucking the internet is all about.  That is so frustrating.  Hey, we got to get Sam in here because the bus monitor who was bullied is on a lot of TV shows.  She is making the rounds and oh, there are people loving it.  Oh my god.  What happened to the little ears? 
[01:09:30]  It's a Scottish fold.  Oh really?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought it was scared or something.  That's all it's doing?  It's up on its hind legs and it's standing.  It's so mad.  No, it's a Scottish fold.  Its ears look like that.  So you should get a kitten, man.  No.  Get a kitten.  No, because then they grow into cats and I have to put them in a burlap sack with weights.  Throw them in my pool.  Jesus. 
[01:10:00]  Sam.  Yeah?  I want you, because I know I'm not going to do it justice, I want you to repeat what you said to me  as you were handing in this audio from the bus monitor.  I said that we are so lucky that we could not get the bus monitor on the air yesterday.  Yeah.  Because we would have ended up bullying her.  She's frustrating.  She is the worst interview I've ever heard on any show.  Really?  The worst.  And that's the big difference because she was on, I watched her on Anderson Cooper last  night.  Yeah.  I watched her on Fox and Friends yesterday morning. 
[01:10:30]  Fox and Friends was live and after watching that you can plainly tell that Anderson Cooper's  interview was heavily edited.  Heavily.  Because of all the pauses.  Right.  And all the sort of, because she doesn't answer questions.  Let me tell you something.  I'm starting to think these kids were on to something.  Just from seeing her in very limited, very limited way on television.  And the fact that she's now got just about a half a million dollars donated to her, and  now she's making the round. 
[01:11:00]  She's the fucking, you know, the it woman of news right now.  Right.  I can't stand her.  Yeah.  I felt bad for her yesterday.  Now I'm just like, ah, good for the kids.  Why are the, once again, why are we the only show that points this shit out?  She doesn't seem terribly upset by anything.  No, I honestly, I have a feeling that the kids knew what they could do with this woman  because when you do go to school, there are those kind of cool teacher or people that 
[01:11:30]  you know are more accepting.  That's what I saw this woman as being.  Kind of some of that edgy shit.  She was laughing at a few points during that video when she was being harassed and bullied.  She was kind of smirking and like, oh, you kids.  Like, like she enjoys that because she knows they're dumb kids.  They're just having fun.  Yeah, I don't know.  I mean, you know, I guess you're not supposed to bully fucking people.  But I think that's what's going on.  But there's more to this story is all I'm saying.  Yes.  I don't think she really cared.  And I don't think it had a major impact. 
[01:12:00]  Like, it happened on a Monday.  I don't think she lost any sleep on Monday night.  No, or any appetite.  She's not losing sleep now.  Badass.  She's got a half million fucking dollars.  And trust me, it'll go to a million.  And now what did I hear?  This will go to a million.  What else is she getting, Travis?  Because that was Anderson Cooper's big name.  That's the big clip.  Yeah, let's not blow the surprise.  Oh, good.  She's raised, she's gotten another $5,000 in the last 20 minutes since I went to her page.  What the fuck?  Wow, she's so hateable. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, I don't like this woman at all.  5,000 in 20 minutes?  Why aren't people realizing this yet?  Because they're still donating.  It's enough money.  And there's people that are just for the first time ever seeing her on TV, seeing the video.  Yeah.  And being like, oh, we have to donate to this poor woman.  Yeah, watch this.  This will get close to a million, I'm thinking.  Oh, my God.  It'll be another big day of donations.  Yeah, she's hateable.  And the kids should get some of this money.  She wouldn't get anything if it wasn't for the kids.  And I'd like to sue her.  It's true.  I'd sue her for some of the money. 
[01:13:00]  I'm a big fan of these people that get famous for really weird shit.  Yeah.  Like, she's famous because people were pointing out her fucking flab and actually poking it.  Poking at her.  So now when you see her, that's what you have to remember.  That's why she's famous.  And I can't wait until she's on one of these shows a year from now where they're chronicling  how she's broke and spent a million dollars within four months.  Oh.  What are we doing?  Or you find out she's a despicable person. 
[01:13:30]  She's going to invest in someone's coffee company that they've made up.  They're going to steal all of her money.  She donates to the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.  They said they were knights.  I didn't know.  Very good.  No, they're knights people.  And they're just trying to keep the colors out.  She just turns into a despicable person.  No, no.  They're not all bad.  But some.  Oh, how great.  Some or most.  Most.  Why don't we, uh, I haven't heard her voice yet, believe it or not.  Uh, let's, uh.  I heard it on this, this, you know, but it's tough to hear. 
[01:14:00]  Let's delve into this wonderful woman now.  Here she is on Fox and Friends.  Good morning to you, Karen.  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, God.  To begin with.  Hi.  Is she frustrating, Sam?  She is beyond, I couldn't believe.  It's all the phlegmy.  And, like, you could tell that the segment was longer than they had intended.  Right.  Because she was taking so long to get to the point on any questions.  Oh, answer the question. 
[01:14:30]  And she didn't even.  Hi.  I'm sure it, I'm sure it's hard to watch that video.  Try to describe how the kids started to bully you this past Monday there on bus number 784.  Well, they actually started out a while ago, but I didn't write a referral for them.  They, um, would mock out my hair, mock out anything they could think of.  But they didn't get vicious like they did on Monday. 
[01:15:00]  They used.  Wow.  She won't even give the, like, they're obviously just looking for sound bites because this is the story.  Yeah.  She wouldn't even give them the sound bites.  No.  She allowed us for a while.  Yeah.  She just said they made fun of her for months and she never even wrote a referral.  No, not even one referral.  Because they were mocking out her hair.  Mocking out my hair.  They used every dirty word I have ever heard to describe you. 
[01:15:30]  And you just sat there.  You know, if it would have been me, I would have wanted to spank them.  But you just sat there and said, come down.  What's wrong with you?  Oh, my God.  Which one is that?  The blonde guy?  Yeah, it's that guy.  What's his name?  The older man.  Oh, he wants to spank teenage boys.  Spank some teen boys.  If I were you, I would have taken their penises in my mouth and taught them a lesson.  What the fuck says spank?  You want to spank 15-year-olds? 
[01:16:00]  You fucking creep.  When you say, as a man, I would have wanted to belt them, you say it in a way where maybe you're not going to get told for saying it.  And he's so worried about people thinking that he wants to beat up kids, that he's okay with saying things.  Like, it sounds like he wants to sexually abuse kids.  Yes, instead of beating them, it sounds like he wants to sexually abuse them.  I'd take this kid in the shower and have a soap bottle with him.  Yeah.  And spank him, but you just sat there and took it.  Why? 
[01:16:30]  I don't like confrontations like that.  I didn't want to do anything to hurt anybody.  That wouldn't have looked good either.  You know, I probably would have been fired, actually, if I'd have done anything violent.  So I just restrained myself, and I tried to pretend that they weren't doing this.  I've escaped a lot of my life and trying to let things go, you know? 
[01:17:00]  Half a million dollars.  I understand.  No, you don't.  No, you don't.  You don't understand one fucking bit, do you?  At this point, you're like, holy fuck, this is going to be a long interview.  Oh, yeah.  Because when kids are yelling at you, there's two options.  Either start swinging or sit silently.  There's no in between.  No.  I understand.  At one point, one of the kids said, you didn't have a family because they all killed themselves 
[01:17:30]  because they didn't want to be...  Why am I laughing?  Oh, boy.  It's black comedy, right?  Of course.  Is that why we're laughing?  We're laughing for a different reason.  It's just horrible.  Yeah.  I think it's just how he says it.  They all killed themselves because they didn't want to be near to you.  He's pulling her.  And that was particularly harmful because your oldest son took his life 10 years ago.  Well, you know, I know you said that as a sort of a joke, but he's doing what the kids 
[01:18:00]  did.  Right.  For a different reason.  His job now is to make her so sad with what they said to her that she will now cry in front  of his face.  That's right.  If she cries on camera, that's great for them.  That's exactly what he's going for.  And that's what he's doing.  He don't give a fuck about this lady.  He's like, okay, we got this lady.  It's a big story in the news.  My job now is to make her cry.  Do you realize how fucking great that would be for him if he got her crying and he was  able to go, there, that's okay.  Right, right.  It's okay. 
[01:18:30]  Take as much time as you need.  Right.  That's all right.  Oh, isn't that...  See what the bullying does here, people.  Do you see what it does to...  Oh, what a despicable person.  You're right, because they're the reason they cry, and then they comfort them, and you  want to say, hey, asshole, the only reason she's crying is because you made her cry.  Because you fucking brought it all up again.  You sick fuck.  Could have been a little more delicate with that.  Yeah, yeah.  Your oldest son took his life ten years ago.  Ten years ago.  Right. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  That's it, huh?  That's it?  That was supposed to be a big fucking moment for her.  That's exactly correct.  That's right.  Now, you made...  They made fun of, um, your weight.  Your weight.  Now, since you are a fat ass, do you think that they had any right...  Yeah.  Now, your saggy tits.  Instead of crying, she's responding with, yes, that is factual. 
[01:19:30]  Yes.  Yeah, great.  The son took his life ten years ago.  Ten years ago.  Right.  Yeah.  I did not hear that part then.  But, yeah.  I mean, it was uncalled for.  That's for sure.  It's uncalled for.  Everything they said.  Absolutely uncalled for.  When I look at it, they seem like monsters to me.  What should happen to these kids?  Oh, they're not monsters. 
[01:20:00]  I don't know what's going to happen for sure.  But I know there are so many upset people all over the world about this.  And...  And I'll...  I've turned the corner on.  She just...  How awful is she?  All over the world.  These aren't the questions he's asking.  No.  Just a terrible interview.  It's just a tough spot to be in.  Wow. 
[01:20:30]  What do you think?  You know what?  They always made the bus monitors and the hall monitors those kind of crazy women.  Right.  They were always a little off to be...  They couldn't be the teachers or, you know, anybody of real authority.  They just kind of put a body in there.  A little crazy.  The kids were brutal to it.  A step down from the lunch lady.  She looks like a lunch lady.  And then we're mad that she's not media savvy.  She's thrust into the public eye within one day. 
[01:21:00]  And we're pissed off.  For being bullied.  And we're mad at her because she doesn't know how to fucking conduct an interview.  She doesn't know how to answer a question properly on live TV.  Yeah.  What's wrong with her?  Hey, fuck her a million bucks.  It all comes down to them and what happens with them.  It happens.  I don't know what will happen.  I haven't heard anything yet.  Happen.  Well, if they're this rotten at this age, just wait until they become grown-ups.  I mean, I certainly don't want them to go to jail for this. 
[01:21:30]  Come on.  She can at least have a conversation.  I'm not saying you have to know how to be TV savvy.  That is true.  This is obviously a woman you can't speak to.  I'm thinking on your feet there, dummy.  He's a horrible interviewer.  He is.  He's on Fox and Fox.  I love how they just waited, though.  Yeah.  It's like, let's see how long she's going to take to even answer this, if she ever does.  And it wasn't an emotional pause. 
[01:22:00]  It was just her kind of staring.  Karen talks about the parents and the money she got.  What about the parents?  What about the parents?  Has anybody reached out to you, from the kids who were involved in this, has anybody apologized  to you?  A little.  Yet.  Not yet.  I don't think they've all been interviewed yet.  Just one boy that I know of.  And apparently he wrote an apology to Athena and one to me. 
[01:22:30]  Goddess?  Of course, I haven't gotten it yet.  But, well, time will tell.  What is she saying?  Well, I know that ever since this video, and it's ten minutes long, went on the internet,  it has gone viral.  And so many people have just watched it.  And their hearts have broken for you.  I understand some blogger decided, you know what?  This woman sat there, took it. 
[01:23:00]  She is poorly paid by the school district.  I believe you make $15,000 a year as a bus monitor.  So what they've done is, somebody came up with the idea, let's send her on a nice vacation.  And I just checked the website, and this particular blogger has attracted so many people to it,  they have raised $125,000 that they want to put in your hand that you could...  Is that...  That was yesterday. 
[01:23:30]  That was yesterday.  It's now $453,000.  $453,000.  If she makes $15,000 a year, that's 30 years' worth of salary.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  I would take a bullying for that.  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  Fucking take an ass beating.  Since this segment started, she's made $800.  Oh, man.  Damn it.  It's just...  It's ridiculous.  It's way more than me.  Sleepy Joe 5, man, on the Twitter, writes,  I really hate being this guy, but if she's suffered her whole life,  then she deserves all the money she gets, and I don't like her. 
[01:24:00]  It's a weird thing here.  I mean, the kids were fucking brutal.  Oh, they were.  But now we're just kind of making fun of the fact that she's kind of just...  She's a lump just sitting there trying to fucking interview a fucking...  A wart.  Yeah, but maybe I could put, like, a YouTube video of you guys making fun of me  and finally get some cake.  You know what I mean?  Ah, yes.  Like, making fun of my Google skills or something.  Did you have a video go viral yesterday, by the way?  Somewhat viral.  It was on Fox Nation.  Why?  It was my interview with the Miss USA pageant. 
[01:24:30]  But they said it was awkward or something?  Yeah.  And I watched most of it.  I didn't see anything awkward.  At 4 minutes and 28 seconds, there's a fantastic awkward silence.  Because I asked them if they got upset when girls were just dumb as bricks.  Dumb as bricks.  And they just stared at me for, like, five long seconds.  Really?  Yeah, it was funny.  Let's find that part.  428.  Put in your hand that you could either take a big vacation or maybe retire tomorrow. 
[01:25:00]  Oh, my God.  It's unbelievable.  I just don't...  It's wonderful.  I would like to thank all these people, but it's really not possible when they do it through Facebook.  I just want to make a general statement.  Thank you, everybody, so much for your support.  I really appreciate it. 
[01:25:30]  Throw mama from the train, lady.  It's the people themselves.  That sounds...  That I appreciate.  So, help me.  Owen!  She's on CNN right now, man.  Oh, my God.  She's going to hit a million dollars.  There's no stopping this thing.  She'll like butter because it's all fucking lard.  Those kids, they were horrible.  Like, in their jokes, I mean.  Their jokes were terrible.  They should have come up with better material.  They try to end the interview.  Karen doesn't take the hint. 
[01:26:00]  Well, you know what?  But, Karen...  You know what?  People realize you just cannot bully somebody else like that.  And that's why so many people are outraged.  And that's why so many people have contributed.  And for the viewers right now, if you'd like to contribute to Karen's trip of a lifetime,  go to Indiegogo.com backslash love for Karen H. Klein.  Karen Klein, joining us today from Rochester.  Thank you very much.  I have a lot of places for the money. 
[01:26:30]  I bet you do.  Oh, yeah, I do.  All right.  Oh, my God.  I could pay all my credit cards.  Oh, no, I know.  Well, good luck to you.  And thank you very much for sharing your story with us today, Karen.  All right.  Straight ahead on Fox.  You're playing.  Wow.  Hilarious.  Oh, my God.  They did have this sweeper and everything.  A little sounder.  Switch on to the next thing.  I got a lot of places for fucking money. 
[01:27:00]  Wow.  I don't know.  Her Q factor is going down by the day.  I believe they did that.  They had this sense of regret.  It reminds you of those, you know, psychological experiments.  You know, how far people will go.  How far people will go.  And, you know, especially teenagers, middle school.  Bullying the bullies is not exactly the solution to stop bullying.  Quick numbers.  Margaret's had two million views of that YouTube video and over half a million dollars.  About half a million dollars.  That means a quarter from everyone that's watched.  That's awesome.  I love that.  All right.  Still ahead on starting point this morning. 
[01:27:30]  That's not awesome.  I quite frankly don't think she deserved that much fucking money.  That's true.  You don't get $500,000 if you suffered all your life.  That guy's wrong.  Just because you had a hard life doesn't mean you have to get it.  She's in the right place at the right time.  People bash on her and, you know, she fucking took it and sat there.  There are people that have been through so much worse than that.  That ain't making a dime.  She deserves 60 grand.  You think 60 G's is a...  60 grand.  I don't even think 60 grand. 
[01:28:00]  I'd give her a year's salary.  15.  Well, that's a year's salary.  That's a lot.  60 grand ain't gonna happen.  I'll tell you what, I'll give you $10,000 right now.  Cash money.  There's just no market for bullying victims.  I just don't get people coming in here.  All right, look.  I'm not sure about this.  I'm gonna bring in a friend.  He's an expert on these situations.  And he'll let me know how much bullying like this is really worth.  But the dude said I should get $400,000.  That ain't gonna happen. 
[01:28:30]  That ain't gonna happen, son.  Not even close.  Not even close.  Not even close.  Half a million dollars ain't even close to what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking more like $5,000.  That's cash.  No PayPal.  No website.  Cash money.  Cash money.  I'd give her a year.  You'd give her 15 G's.  That's a year's salary.  That's nice.  For a good bullying?  Yeah.  I think Ann's right.  I think there's people out there fucking pissed off because they've suffered way more. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  And I can't wait for the second because there's always a second person that's gonna...  The copycat one.  That's gonna get bullied and then they're gonna put the same shit up and no one's gonna care anymore.  No one's gonna care.  This is the cause du jour.  Because as a society, we always just move on.  What happened to Kony?  What?  Oh, yeah.  See?  Kony.  These...  We...  As a society now with this social media, we have our cause du jour.  Slacktivism.  It's...  Yeah.  Yes.  Slacktivism.  Bus monitors are just gonna start walking onto the buses with their underwear sticking  out of their pants and toilet paper on their shoes. 
[01:29:30]  Just trying to look fucking buttons, all buttons sideways.  But they're all fucked.  The videos won't do well.  No, no.  Nothing will happen.  Try to stage it.  Fuck.  Social media.  We care about shit for maybe 24 hours and then we move on to something else.  It really is 24 hours.  24 hours.  It's like...  And then it goes away.  Right.  Bus monitor comes on with a new kids on the block shirt.  Hey, kids.  Is this band still cool?  What do you guys think?  I'm cool like you youngins.  Look at me.  Get at your video cameras. 
[01:30:00]  Oh, God.  Just doesn't work.  No.  I'm starting to think that Bieber's never gonna be a man.  No, he's not.  He's growing into a woman.  I think he has a really good chance of being a lesbian.  Yeah.  He kind of looks that way.  He's starting to get a little too old and he's still...  Still looking a little androgynous.  Awkward face.  You're very right.  He might be androgynous.  The problem is, as he gets older, he actually looks more like Rachel Maddow.  Oh.  Oh, fuck yeah.  When he was a kid, it was like, okay, he hasn't hit puberty yet. 
[01:30:30]  But he's like 18, 19 years old.  Well, he needs some whiskers.  But he's shaving his face, keeping it clean, so the girls still think he's pretty best.  So the young girls, yeah, come on to him still.  He's got hair on his balls, though, for sure.  He's got to have hairy balls.  At this point in his life.  Yeah.  Wow.  Do you want to watch Sam's awkward thing that you learned?  Oh, sure.  Okay.  You guys are all...  I think it's very important.  Yeah, it is.  But you, all three, are by far good-looking enough to just get by on that. 
[01:31:00]  What?  Yeah, at some point.  But if you make your money now, you know what I mean?  You'll have it.  Like, then does it frustrate you to see good-looking women that don't educate themselves and are just dumb as bricks?  Oh, man.  Are there questions that you're worried about being asked?  Wow.  They all just look like...  What was that look, dude?  Like, oh, I hope I don't have to comment on this.  Because this is...  That was the most awkward part. 
[01:31:30]  Wow.  They should have just played that.  I didn't get to that part of the video.  Man, what are you thinking?  That's what you should have thrown out there.  I don't know.  They're just staring at you.  It says it in the description.  That's great.  That really is good.  What was it?  Fucking not cool, bro?  What was it?  It was...  Not cool, bro.  No, it was fucking lame, bro.  Oh, that was that question there, Sam.  Fucking lame, bro.  Fucking lame, bro.  So, this bus monitor ended up on Anderson Cooper. 
[01:32:00]  Making the rounds.  You thought we were done.  But you can even hear it in this clip.  He recorded the interview earlier in the day.  And so you can hear...  The edits?  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be edited time.  And the whole thing was like this.  I know you know about the money that's been raised, that's been donated by people around the country and probably around the world.  We've just learned one other thing that you don't know about.  Southwest Airlines reached out to us today.  They've been extraordinarily touched by your story.  They wanted us to let you know that they'd like to send you and nine people to Disneyland in California for three nights, airfare, hotel, and car, all included. 
[01:32:30]  You've got to be kidding me.  It sounds like one of those interviews where you take clips and then you make the question.  Yeah, yeah.  Like Tenny's with Gaga?  Yeah.  You know, answer on to something.  People really suffer out there.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah, she got bullied and it was horrible and something should be done, of course.  But now it's way over the top.  And now it's just to get your name out there, like Southwest Airlines, Disneyland. 
[01:33:00]  Like, why does this fat fuck want to go to Disneyland?  And she doesn't know any nine people.  No.  Ten of her going to Disneyland.  She could take the fucking kids on the bus.  Could you see she fucking, like, just takes all the kids on the bus and they relentlessly pound her from the plane trip?  Yeah, it's a fucking small world after all, except for you, fat ass.  Hey, Dumbo.  Look, hey, look, the Dumbo ride.  Look, why don't you just get up there?  Oh, you're up there already. 
[01:33:30]  We know about Southwest.  If they're giving her and nine people a truck, airfare to Disney, they're going to need to give her more than one plane ticket.  Yes.  You know how that is.  Fat people, they kick them off with Southwest.  And that's right.  These companies jump on board because now they're getting free fucking advertising.  Advertising.  They don't give a fuck about her.  They see an opportunity, which, you know, why not?  Everybody, let's sit over on the other side of the plane so it levels out because fat ass is over there.  She's just, stop it.  They're just bullying her relentlessly. 
[01:34:00]  Poking her ears.  Fucking, yeah.  Poking her fucking Mickey Mouse ears that she's got on.  Yeah, fucking big ears for your big fucking gut.  Which one are you, Tweedledum?  Yeah, you're a Tweedledum fuck.  Tweedled cunt.  Tweedledum as shit.  Which hotel room are you staying at?  I'm going to piss on your door.  Oh, shit, man.  Fair, fair, hotel, and car all included. 
[01:34:30]  You've got to be kidding me.  Oh, there's the edit.  It's awesome.  Nine people?  Do you have nine people you'd want to bring?  Oh, that was obvious.  Yes.  My family.  Minus a couple.  Don't bully.  Hey, you just bullied somebody.  That's not nice.  Bullying her family.  She just bullied her own family.  What's wrong with her?  Jesus. 
[01:35:00]  Not very nice at all.  Minus a couple.  Wow, that's too much.  Did you ever expect this kind of support?  No.  Never.  I mean, I don't feel like I've done anything.  Hey, Tinker's shit.  You know?  That's what's awesome.  It's the pausing that drives you nuts.  Oh, man, is she annoying.  Very frustrating.  Now she gets a trip to Disneyland with nine people she knows and half a million bucks. 
[01:35:30]  I've got to go on the record here.  I really do.  I am 100% behind the kids now on this one.  100%?  100%.  I don't even fucking have any sympathy for this woman at all anymore.  And I feel like all the nasty things, like that newscaster said the kids were rotten,  and all the terrible things that have been said about these kids.  Maybe we should start a website.  We should donate to these poor kids that have now just been put on the news. 
[01:36:00]  How do we do that?  Just start an Indiegogo page.  Let's set up an account for the kids, because they've been called horrible things on TV news.  And you know what that does psychologically?  They were just being kids on the bus.  I mean, that newscaster not only called them rotten, but said he wanted to spank them.  He thinks about spanking them.  Violence against them.  Something maybe sexual.  The mental anguish they must be feeling, because they're just being persecuted.  How do we write up this page?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:36:30]  Get that fucking page.  And let's get a press release out there.  Once we get enough money, then we can set up a page for ourselves.  Right.  Right.  No, we're taking our taste.  We're taking 10%.  Not like this idiot.  Of everything that the kids make.  The kids will get 40%.  It's called an administration fee.  Right.  You can tell when this story is on the news.  Because it pops, right?  Yeah.  Holy shit.  How much now?  She's made...  She's made a couple thousand since we started talking about her.  Yeah.  She's made over $2,000 since we started talking about her at 7.30. 
[01:37:00]  Refresh again.  Let me see what this does.  Refresh.  4-4-3.  I mean, it...  I might refresh every...  Yeah, like every minute or so.  All right.  Well, there you go.  Raised of $5,000 goal.  I guess he wanted a $5,000 goal.  His goal at first was $5,000.  Holy shit.  He is bummed that he didn't take his taste.  He thought five grand, give it to her.  Hey, man.  Yeah, I mean, he would get taxed on that.  Is she going to get, like, the giant check? 
[01:37:30]  Hey, the check's as big as your fat ass.  Is that check for your pocket because your pants are so big?  Big chubby.  What, are you crying?  Crying out of the top of your eyes?  Or is that lard leaking out of your head?  You fucking idiot.  Kids were awful.  Oh, they were awfully great.  But they made her a ton of cash.  They did.  Her life is completely...  You know what that shit life would have been if those kids were quiet and didn't say anything?  She'd been on that dumbass fucking bus.  She's fucking sitting there.  We should be praising the kids. 
[01:38:00]  They made someone's life better.  They hooked her up using social media.  Right.  See?  Imagine that.  They had it, and they knew this was going to happen, yet they have to keep quiet about it  so as not to look like they knew.  But they were, like, all got together and had a meeting the day before this  and said, we're going to do something that's going to make everyone love this woman  and have sympathy for her,  and we'll sacrifice ourselves for this.  And then they did it.  She should be starting college funds for those kids.  Yes, absolutely.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  All right.  Jesus Christ.  Joe DeRosa is outside the studio.  Yes, he is.  Lovely and talented, Joe DeRosa.  Any other guests?  I think he's back in New York City.  Might have Tammy Pescatelli in today, too.  I saw her in the lobby.  Oh, I love the Pescatelli.  My mother used to make it melt in your fucking mouth, that Pescatelli.  She's from Chicago, so maybe we can learn about Chicago, finally.  Chicago's some deep dish pizza, maybe.  We're obsessed with Chicago lately.  Hey, a little obsessed there about the deep dish pizza.  Pizza.  You want some Entenmann's Chicago guy? 
[01:39:00]  I want some of that Entenmann's.  Entenmann's coffee cake is really good stuff there to stuff down your fucking throat  after having a deep dish pizza.  What happened to that coffee cake?  It's always a problem when we ask for it.  Eric says they don't have any.  Yeah, because they have to fucking fancy it up.  Yeah.  You want some strudel on it?  With some of those swirls and swizzles.  No, I just want that.  They like to swizzle it up. 
[01:39:30]  Swizzle.  I don't like anything that's drizzled on.  Drizzle or swizzle.  Mix it thoroughly and then drizzle on top.  Drizzle it.  I don't want it drizzled.  Fuck that.  Everything that's drizzled looks like cum.  You don't drizzle anything unless it looks like yeesh.  Oh, by the way, I read a lot of tweets.  By the way.  I want to thank everyone for reaching out and saying the Billy Corgan, and I said Corgan  a few times, we're an asshole, that they enjoyed the Billy Corgan interview. 
[01:40:00]  They certainly did.  They really seemed to enjoy that one.  You know what?  I appreciate all the nice tweets about that.  It was exactly, a lot of people thought exactly like I did, that he was going to come in here,  be the too cool for the room, kind of mysterious, evasive rock guy, and he turned out to be  so fucking cool that he absolutely could have hung the whole show, and it would have just been great.  And he was surprised he had to leave.  I think he was surprised that the time went by so fast, because he looked at me like,  are you kicking me out? 
[01:40:30]  And I'm like, no, your people are saying you've got a fucking flight to catch.  He looked like he would have hung another hour easily.  I'm off to Holly Rock.

Today's guest  Joe DeRozan  I do a bit about this  About like the stair step up to it  It's like it's not as easy 
[01:42:00]  As would you just swallow the cum  There are many levels of things you need to get through first  I might be fucking all in  I might want to go all the way  Here's the thing  Now what would you do with the dick?  That's the thing I don't know  That's what he hasn't really answered  I wouldn't be into swallowing any jizz  No, you have to  That's the thing  Why are you making these rules?  Quarantine rules  Because it makes it more interesting  Quarantine rules  No, yeah, yeah, no  I've had my own jizz on my face  What's the difference?  It's another man's  Wow  It looks like Joe DeRozan  Is going to suck dick 
[01:42:30]  That's all the time we have this week  Tune in next time  When Ricky Gervais tries to decide  That's not only a dick  That's the biggest dick in the world  Should I suck a dick  Or not?  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show  What happened, Eric? 
[01:43:00]  Oh, E-Rock  What happened, dude?  It's supposed to bring us back in professional fashion  Yeah, that's not good  What happened?  The rejoinder was there and it disappeared right as it played  Really?  I think someone hit the delete button  I think someone needs a spanking  Fucking creep  Oh, well  If I was you, I would have  I would have given them a spanking  Give them a spanking  You know, I know, I know  There's parents out there that still do that spanking shit  It's connected to some kind of sexuality 
[01:43:30]  I'm sorry  Spanking is fucking creepy  Well, it depends on how you do it  I used to get quite a sound thrashing  And there was nothing sexual about it whatsoever  Believe me  When you had to pull your little pants down  That was early  Early on  That just goes with the degrading part of it  Makes the parent the real, you know  Gives them the upper hand in the whole relationship early on  Right  Where they're like, you know  It's like, oh man  I'm being degraded  It's like a fucking P.O.W. camp  Yeah  And they're the guards  And you're the prisoner 
[01:44:00]  It's like, you gotta do whatever they say  Pull your pants down  Like, eeeh  That's not, uh  That's not, uh  Reduce the experience of the P.O.W.s  To a spanky in the kitchen  You know what?  I meant the principle of it  The ideology behind wearing someone down  I gotcha  I literally mean  That he was, you know  My dad and mom were starving me to death  Perhaps, uh  It's just like a gas chamber 
[01:44:30]  It's exactly like it  Joe DeRozan's studio  Yes  Guys  Joe, uh  Back in New York, full time  How long were you guys?  Two months  That was two months, huh?  Two months  But I was on the show  But I was standing on my head  But you were on the show like  You were on the show every week  I was on the show twice  I know  Yeah, what the fuck  It's so funny  I was talking to this girl  A friend of mine last night  She goes, uh  She goes, what are you doing tomorrow?  And I go, oh  I'm doing Opie and Anthony in the morning  I'm excited  I go, I haven't  Haven't seen the guy since I left 
[01:45:00]  Well, I was on the one time  But I was  No, I was on twice  Well, not like three times  You know what?  It's really not that special  It's not that big a deal  And everything's going well for Joey  Moved back to New York  His mom's doing very well  My mom is 100% healthy  110% healthy  Back at work, full time  Driving, doing everything again  On her own  She's  And I said this the last time I was in  But let me say it now  That everything's officially over  I can't thank all of you  At the show enough  For how sincere you guys were 
[01:45:30]  When I talked to you  Off the air about this stuff  And the fans, man  You guys are amazing  The fans  People were emailing  And tweeting me  Every  Still  I'm still getting emails  Where it's like  First thing that everybody says  Is, hey dude  I hope your mom's cool, man  I hope you're good  And then  When are you coming to Poughkeepsie  Or whatever  Really?  Yeah  Wow  I'm astounded  I was showing my mom the messages  She was  Wow, that's cool  It was awesome, man  Let's bring some positivity  Into this show  Yeah, yeah  A little positive note 
[01:46:00]  So Joe looks at me  Well, there it was  Well, that's  Yeah, that's my point  Because then Joe goes  Yeah, everything's going so well  I moved back to New York  Mom's doing well  You think we can keep it  Kind of positive today?  Yeah  Yeah, all was good  Can we try something  A little different?  All was good  Instead of beating the shit  Out of each other?  Yeah  Yeah, everything's exciting  And fucking  Now that that's out of the way  You know who's a fucking cunt?  Yes  Have you ever  Hold on, hold on 
[01:46:30]  We've got to write a note  Yeah  Oh, this is exciting  Have you ever mentioned that  About you?  Oh, yeah  Okay  All the time  Yeah, because I had a thought about that  Oh  Joe DeRosa, you know  Was adopted  What?  And the only reason I bring it up today  Is because  Sandusky's son  Comes out  His adopted son  And says  Yeah, this fucking asshole  Was, you know  Fooling around with me too  Oh, Jesus  And I was thinking to myself  That's gotta  Like, you know  You're adopted into  Some crazy family sometimes 
[01:47:00]  Oh, a family that's gonna fucking  Sexually abuse you  I know you also could do it to  Your own  I don't under  Your own blood, I mean  You know what I mean?  Yeah  But I mean  That's gotta suck  All the families  That want to adopt kids out there  And you get  You're the lucky one  That goes to the Sandusky home  That sucks  I never understood that  I know  I know a few adopted people  Not a lot  But  It worked out very well for you, right?  It was fine for me  I mean, I was adopted at nine days old  Nine days?  Yeah  Holy shit  I don't remember 
[01:47:30]  You know  And my parents  I don't remember them telling me  I was adopted  I just always knew  So they must have started telling me  When I was really young  So my parents did it the right way  Why do they have to tell you?  I think it's the right thing to do  Why?  Don't you?  Because I look like a fucking  Goddamn Sandheeb  And they don't  What?  So I need some explanation for that  Do you have black parents?  Yeah, right  That would be great  I don't know  I'm not telling you  Well, Anthony still lets me in his house 
[01:48:00]  So  That's true  Yeah  Do you have a  Do you have any desire to meet the old  Biological people there?  No  Well, here's the thing  With being adopted  That  Sucks  No matter  I think this happens to everybody  No matter how well your parents do it  How right they do it  There's all this  I have a lot of subconscious stuff  That started coming up  When I hit about 30  29 or 30  You know  Abandonment issues  Oh man  Intimacy issues 
[01:48:30]  These things start popping up  And you're kind of like  In the weird nine days  You were fucking given away there  And it still comes up  Yeah, because I think your whole life  I mean, look  When you're a kid  Kids will make fun of you  Like when you're in grade school  Yeah  Like kids would  At least have not adopted  You know, people say stuff like that  Why would you  Bullied  Give them a half a mil  What?  You need a website for Joe DeRozan  Like that old fat bus broad  Yeah  Why  Why do the kids have to know you're adopted? 
[01:49:00]  Uh, because I never thought  There was anything like strange about it  I just  It was just part of my  Upbringing  Thing  Yeah, I just  I would talk about it  Like anything else  Like I have a brother  You know what I mean?  Like that, you know  Do you find it weird  That you have a biological mom  And dad out there  That are just right now  Wandering around somewhere possibly?  That would be so strange for me  Um  The thing I always worried about  With finding them  I don't think I want to find them  And the thing I was worried about  With finding them  Was that, you know 
[01:49:30]  I'm half Egyptian  And half Italian  Are you rich?  No  You might be a Saudi prince  Then you fucking find them  Because it's like a lottery  Well  If I was adopted  I'm  I'm  I'm looking for my  Biological parents  To maybe get, you know  Let me tell you about how  How fucking  A little payout  Let me tell you the hard ends  Of that lottery spectrum  Okay  With Egyptians  Yeah  Uh, the Italian side  I wasn't worried about  My Egyptian side  I wasn't worried about  Because I'm like  On the one hand  They could be fucking barons  With those little  Uh  With those little teacup hats on 
[01:50:00]  Yeah  I don't know how they keep  Those hats on  Yeah  So that's the one side  I'm like  I gotta find these motherfuckers  And get a room at the mansion  The other side is  They live in a market  Where they have a monkey  That fetches them  Steals them apples  Every night for dinner  And now you gotta take care of them  With the little human  Yeah, exactly  I gotta free them  Like it's Temple of Doom  Fuck that shit  I'm not doing that  I would take a risk  I would take the risk  Temple of Doom  I would take the risk though 
[01:50:30]  For the payoff  Uh  His biological father's going  Call him  Trying to pull people's hearts out  Please let me die  Alright, good point, Joe  Good point  I don't  You know, man  There's so much  To find in your parents  In that situation, man  It's  Are you gonna  I thought you were gonna  Hit Joe over the head  No, no  You saw that, right?  Sorry, I was just  Scratching my back  With my  Anthony just picked up the flute 
[01:51:00]  You thought he was gonna  Hit me  I thought he was gonna  Start playing Arab music  On it  Oh, I could  Wait, wait, wait  Here we go  He'll come up with some  It's  I don't know what that is  You just do that  I just go  Whoa  Here's the thing  It's  You know  Another part of it for me  Was 
[01:51:30]  Is it worth  Is it worth it  It's not just gonna affect me  It's gonna affect everybody  Around me  And my family  But it's such a mystery  I would have to know  It's easy to say that  Because I'm not adopted  It's a different mindset  I'm sure  But I just  Where I sit  I would have to just  At least know  Or look at them from afar  Even  Find out where they fucking live  And maybe just  You know  Stake out their joints  For a while  Let me stalk them  For a while  See if they're worth  A relationship  I think you gotta  I mean  You don't know 
[01:52:00]  You gotta  I don't know if I'd want  The relationship  Because I'm sure  Your parents are your parents  Right, Joe?  Yeah  And who knows  They're probably  You know  I mean  That's part of what I'm saying  Though  Is that  It's not just  I'm just talking about  The curiosity part  I would have to know  I don't know  If I'd want a relationship  Or any of that shit  Right  It's like  You gave up on me  At nine days old  Go fuck yourself  I'm good  I can see  Your parents  Your birth parents  Are thinking the same thing  Like well  He could be  A big executive  At Apple  Or he could be 
[01:52:30]  You know  A stand up comic  Or something  Right, right  Exactly  With the  Drinking problem  Oh god  Let's face it  Let's face it  People that have a lot of money  Don't give a kid up  For adoption  That's true  You know  The chances of them  Being rich are slim  Because  Maybe they won the lottery  You know  There's  You know  The only  If you're rich  And you give the kid up  It's like  You're partying  Too fucking hard  And then you don't  You don't  Give him for adoption  You just get it sucked out  And then  You're not gonna care 
[01:53:00]  If he shows up either  Or he's gonna be like  Oh what's this kid want  I gave him away  Or he could be  A fucking little  Dumb boomerang  Leave  Well I used to have a bit  About it  Where I'd say  I'd say  What am I gonna  People will go  Are you gonna go find them  You're gonna look  For your real parents  And I go  No I pretty much  Took the hint  When they abandoned me  That's very good  But you're  You're a filmmaker  Yeah  You like making little films  Man that's your film  And it would be hilarious  To see how it turns out  I have an idea 
[01:53:30]  For a movie about it  And I don't wanna say it  On the air  For obvious reasons  Yeah  People steal  What's the idea  Searching for my real  Biological  Not real  I apologize  Cause I  I get the adoption thing  Cause it's part of my family now  So I get it  Yeah  Your parents are your real parents  Yeah  The search for your biological  Yeah  But it's not a  The movie idea I have  Isn't a biological story  It's  It's not  Or autobiographical  Excuse me  Yeah  I gotcha  It's  It's a  It's a fictional 
[01:54:00]  Oh a fictional  What we call fiction  In the business  Of film  Do you want  I gotta go to the phones  We haven't gone on the phones  In a couple days now  By the way  But we gotta go to the phones  Because  Two people on the phone  That found  Their  Oh  Biological parents  I've heard some horror stories  Nice  One's a good story  And one's a bad story  Which one do you want first  The good one  Let's save the bad one  Alright  You know  We got Chris in Michigan  Chris you can relate to what Joe's saying here 
[01:54:30]  Huh  Yeah well  It wasn't me  It was my uncle  Alright  He was giving up  My aunt's husband  He was giving up for adoption  When he was a kid  And he never really had any  Interest in finding his parents  His dad actually found him  It turns out dad  Got a girl knocked up  And went off to the army  And her parents  Didn't like that he was  A Native American  And  Oh boy  Gave the kid up for adoption  So a couple years ago  His dad found him  Dad's a member of the  Pechanga tribe 
[01:55:00]  Out there in California  One of the biggest  Fucking casinos out there  And put his son  Who he didn't know  Or anything  On the rolls  Several years before  So he got this giant  Huge ass payout  At first  And then every month  You know  He gets thousands  And thousands  And thousands  Jesus  What are you waiting for  Nothing to lose  Oh man  Get out there  So basically  He's a millionaire  Right  Well  There was never  Hold on  Hold on  What  He runs back 
[01:55:30]  He flies back  Home here to Michigan  You know  Every other week  And flies back out there  First class  Back and forth  First class  Joe  There was never  There was never  A better opportunity  For a smash cut  Of things  To things going wrong  Than you going  What are you waiting for  You have nothing to lose  And then yeah  Bam  There you are  And then it cuts  In a losing situation  And you hear a gong noise  And it's me walking  Through an empty village  Excuse me  A fucking marketplace  With like chickens  Being beheaded 
[01:56:00]  Your biological father  Is missing a foot  Because of a deal  Gone bad  First of all  I'm not a fucking  American Indian  First of all  But you don't know  That's the beauty of this  I know  I know  I'm Egyptian and Italian  But I mean  You don't know  What they  Some Egyptian thing  Well they didn't become  American Indians  With casinos  Something  You get some of that  Pyramid money  He might own  The Lexar there  In Vegas  Can I ask you this  What was your uncle  Doing before his  Biological father 
[01:56:30]  Found him  He owned his own  Business  It was mostly  Landscaping and stuff  He's a landscaper  Those guys like to say  They own their own business  Yeah well you know  Alright so he went  From a landscaper  To landscaping  To first class  Fucking plane tickets  Joe  It's to check out  His share of the casino  It's  Listen  It trusts me  When I tell you this  Just take my word  It is not gonna work out  For me like that  Nothing ever works out 
[01:57:00]  For me like that  Yeah but maybe  This is the one thing  That does  You said addiction  What if you're related  To the own asses  Or some shit like that  You know  Well look  It's  Anything's possible  But again  Would they give a kid  Up for adoption  Yeah  Unless it was something  That was gonna disgrace  The family like  Yeah but  What if you find out  That last name is  Tut  But Joe  You're looking at it  Gold in that family  You're looking at it  Not the right way 
[01:57:30]  Because  They've had  30 years  To make something  Of themselves  You're thinking  When you were  Nine days old  I'm thinking  30 some odd years  I don't even know  I am thinking selfishly  I'm only concerned  About dismantling  My entire fucking life  And destroying  My parents soul  It's really  It's shitty of me  I should be more  Open minded  But they might be  Able to get a little  Action out of this too  How  Huh  Because Joe gets  The action  Then he passes it  On to the parents  That loved him  His entire life  What if I met him  And they go 
[01:58:00]  Now here's a million dollars  You don't give a fucking  Penny of this  To those imposters  Alright  Here's the other side  Of the coin  That Joe's talking about  Let's go to  Billy in Ohio  Billy  Hello  How you doing  Hey Billy  You're the right one though  Because I was  I was in trouble  When I was younger  I was adopted  My mom and dad  Seeked  My real parents out  They  Yeah  Oh boy  Yeah  My  My real mom  Was a heroin addict  She died at like  42

[02:07:00]  Straight up  Never told her  Her daughter went to get married  Found out  Out of getting the marriage certificate  That she was adopted  She went  That shit insane  Flipped on her mom  Dumped the soon to be husband  Has been gone for five years  We literally have no trace of her  Fuck the family up completely  They're destroyed now  See  She told her at her wedding  No  She never  The plan was to never tell her 
[02:07:30]  But  So that the family was hush hush  Some knew she was adopted  Some didn't  And then on top of that  When she applied to get the marriage certificate  The government told her  Oh wow  The government  Wow  Wow  And she just went AWOL  Yes  Oh she fucking  She's gone  I don't know  She might be fucking  DeRosa's dad  I don't know  This guy bugs me  Why does he bug you?  He's got too much swagger  He just fucking bugs me  It might be a fake story 
[02:08:00]  He's talking like he's got a fucking  Glass of wine in one hand  And a cigar in the other  Yeah it might be a fake story  No guys  It really  If you want  Whatever  It's not  I don't believe you Derek  Alright Derek  Why'd you make that up?  Yeah Derek  Thank you sir  Good story  Good story  We took one too many phone calls  Oh man  Anyway  He was obnoxious that guy  So we're not gonna find your biological parents?  Nah I'm not doing it man  I don't need to do it  I got enough fucking things in my life going on right now 
[02:08:30]  I don't need any other goddamn grief over this  Do you know the  Do you know how stressful  Forget about the actual meeting the parents part of it  Can you imagine how stressful just the journey up to that point is?  Oh man  Yeah  It's just gotta be brutal  Maybe Joe  They didn't feel worthy  And wanted to give you a better life  They  Look  That's what he holds on to  Hence  Hence no abandonment issues sir  That's what he's gotta hold on to  Maybe your parents really just wanted to give you a much better chance 
[02:09:00]  That's  I think that's what they were doing  There you go  So why the abandonment issue?  Oh I don't know  That's just  It's one of those  Dude I don't know where that comes from  I mean I can theorize on where it comes from  Maybe your adopted parents used to whisper shit in your ear when you were misbehaving  We're gonna send you back  We're gonna send you back  Right  You know it's  I think it's just  I think it's just a thing  Like a genetic thing  You know  Genetics are a lot 
[02:09:30]  Genetics are a lot stronger than most people give them credit for  In this day and age  You know a lot of people want to ignore genetics and ignore  Also the nurture along with the nature and all that sort of thing  They just want to ignore it  And like going through an experience like that at a very young age  I think can have a lifelong effect on you  And it needs to be dealt with  Do you have traits of your adopted parents?  Like do you have their sense of humor or do you have like 
[02:10:00]  I don't know their anger or I don't know  We have a lot of similar traits  Isn't that weird?  Because you're not biological  And there are people that tell me I look like them  See that's weird  Yeah  The traits you could kind of see  Yeah but they just picked out a kid that they felt looked like them  It's kind of like  It's not how it works  It's kind of like when you see people walking around with dogs  Oh that's funny  And they look like they're dogs  Right  It's the same shit  There aren't cages at Hope  You don't get to just walk and point at a kid and go  That one looks good 
[02:10:30]  I thought that's how adoption worked  Like a pet store  Yeah  So did I  I thought there was like little vats with babies  You weren't in an orphanage and they came walking through  Orphanage  Orphanage  Wearing one of those dresses  Those long rigs that you sleep in  And with the little cap  And they only save  Comes off your head with the pom-pom on the end  And they only save one kid  Yeah what happened was  What a twisted way to do it  The evil landowner was going to shut down the orphanage  If they didn't come up with the rent 
[02:11:00]  And my parents concocted a scheme  Spanky when my back pension comes in  You'll get your monkey  Yeah  No so I mean it's you know  It's look  There's just things that come along with it  I don't look  I don't want to  Christ  You know  But  I just find it fascinating  That's all  Because I got some adoption  Stuff in my family now  And I find it very interesting  That's all  Very hard to adopt  Not cheap 
[02:11:30]  I mean I think when my parents did it  It was  Well  A nice wife  I hear you  I hear you go to Texas  I mean if you  Now if you want like  If you want a special needs child  If you want an Asian  Or that kind of thing  That's  Well of course  I've always equated that  Like if the adoption agency  Was a Sam Goody  The Asian kids would be in that $3 bargain  Oh you think  Because they're just like  Getting rid of them  I don't know what's going on over there  There's so many  It's an overstock of Asian kids  Because once you adopt one 
[02:12:00]  Like one day lady  You want to adopt more  You want to know how I feel about that  Because on the Upper West Side  You got some of these ladies that adopt  Right  Ladies  And you see them  Where they have the Asian kid  And I immediately think  And this is going to be horrible  Cheap and lazy  Oh wow  They got cheap and lazy  With their adoption  It does seem like it's easy to go that route  The Asian route  I think you kind of give in  Instead of going  You know what  I want a kid that's more 
[02:12:30]  Well here's why  More like me meaning  You know I'm white or whatever  Here's why  That comes from a culture  Around the world  That really just casts off children  If they're not  Yeah  The type of child  That that family wants  Right  Especially girls  You know if they want boys and stuff  Yeah  So there's a lot of them available  It's not like they're just giving away  You know  White American kids  I would dare to say  They do not have  The adoration for children  In Asia  That we have  In this country  Nah  When you see a homeless lady 
[02:13:00]  In China  And her kid is missing eyes  And you go  I'm going to give them money  And then the guy  That's taking you around China  Says  Don't do that  She poked her kid's eyes  Out on purpose  To make you feel sorry for her  That's what people do around here  Alright  How do you know that  This is a different  Well a Chinese guy told me  And he lived there  Wow  So that's all I know  By the way  I'm going to base everything on that  By the way  There's nothing wrong with adopting an Asian child  I just want to say that  No of course there's not 
[02:13:30]  Of course not  Who was even fucking getting that idea  But I'm saying  If you want to get this fucking nice  Italian Egyptian mixture  Right  At Sam Goody  But I just feel like  I'm on the rack  Where you're going  1999  Are you fucking kidding me  I just feel like  During the process  You just decided  Alright enough  I'll just take an Asian  Yeah  It seems like  Getting the white kid  Is a little too difficult  And a little  It is  A little too time consuming  So I'll go with the Asian  It's not waiting for the car  That you want  To order  You just take the one 
[02:14:00]  Off the floor  It's like  Well I would have liked it  In red  But I'll take the white car  Yeah  I think  Parents that adopt  I think they're terrific people  I really do  We're making some jokes though  Yeah  Oh they're outraged now  Who is  The people  I can just feel it  Good  I can feel it  Good  It's not my fault  You fucking went cheap  And got an Asian  No I'm kidding  I'm just kidding  I'm just joking  Went to the dollar store  What the fuck  Yeah look  I'm no  I put myself above that  I'm in the bargain bin too 
[02:14:30]  I'm fucking half Arab  I'm just fucking around  No I'm  I'm saying it about myself  I hear Texas is the place to go now  For Arab kids  No just to adopt in general  That's like the hub  That's the hub for adoption  Fucking wasteland down there  People will call  They'll back me up on this  For some reason Texas has become the place  The hub  Yeah if you're one of fucking hills have eyes  Nuclear baby  Why?  It lives in a mountain  Out in that fucking desert  I don't know  I just thought of that  I thought it was funny 
[02:15:00]  And it wasn't that funny  I would take a Texas kid  I would take a Texas kid  Well yeah  Why wouldn't you?  They come from good stock  Do they?  I don't know  I don't know shit  But Texas is discarding a lot of kids?  I would adopt actually  I don't think you would  From where?  I swear to God  I would adopt  Because I'm  What would you go for?  I don't know  If my wife wants to go through  A bunch more pregnancies  What would you go for?  It's expensive dude  White kid or would you go specialty item? 
[02:15:30]  You'd have a couple of white kids already  No I would  That's why I was making dumb jokes  I probably would go  African baby?  Well  African baby?  You would disown me  No  I like African babies  But man  They look like  They look like models though man  They look like fucking models  Who?  African babies?  I would adopt the black kids  They all start out looking like models  You gotta pick out the right ones  I'd go with a mix  Yeah  I think it'd be cute  To have a little Asian kid 
[02:16:00]  No I'm being dead serious though  Without the jokes  I would adopt  Yeah  I would throw  Adopt a kid into the mix  Well here's the thing  Why not?  Why  If I get a big house  Why not?  Why wouldn't you?  That's what  Like that's the  Not you specifically  I mean you wouldn't  Because you're selfish  But  But I'm not selfish  I play a good role on the show  But  Oh my god  I gotta defend myself a little bit  I'm just joking  I'm not a monster  Like you think  Go ahead 
[02:16:30]  Theoretically  Blown up your joke  I'm sorry  I'm sorry  Theoretically  Why wouldn't you adopt  I mean this generally  The you  It's like  There are  There are  Literally  Thousands to millions  Of children that need it  Number one  Number two  You don't gotta go through  All the  Like you just said  With your wife  Going through the body stuff  You don't have to go through  The misery  Of putting your body  It's tough man  It's tough  And there is something beautiful  About the entire process  Of conception to childbirth 
[02:17:00]  Obviously  Especially the conception part  Of your  Yeah  Yeah  Yeah  Where's Josh  When we need him  Yeah  It's fucking  Ah  Josh  Fun loving Josh  Yeah so it's like  But you know  It's like  But it's  It's so easy  It's  I mean it's not easy  It's finance  It's a lot of money  That's probably why  But  It's like  Why not  Just go adopt a kid  And I never understood  Probably because I'm adopted  I never understood that whole  But it's not mine 
[02:17:30]  Thing  Oh no man  I never got that  And I  I've never thought  Ever since I was a kid  I never believed in that  Blood is thicker than water  Horse shit  It is though  Oh I was talking chemically  Hence where that comes from  See  It's absolutely correct  Joe  Yes  You're right  I'm sorry  I was talking chemically too  I don't know why I said that  Oh  Yeah no  I just  I just never  I never bought it  I was always like  If you're a fucking douche  You're a douche  And if you're not  You're not 
[02:18:00]  I don't give a shit  If we're related  You're one of those guys  That doesn't want to have kids right  I have  You know what's funny  Until we just started talking  About Asian kids  I didn't want kids  And then I started  Thinking about having  A little Asian baby  And I liked it  It was making  Making me happy  To think about that  Oh yeah man  Asian kids are cute  Raise someone  That can do your taxes eventually  I'm going to time it  I'm going to time it perfectly  I'm going to time it perfectly  Where I'll adopt a kid  Yeah  And then  It'll be just in time  For them to have to take care  Of my fucking floundering ass  There you go 
[02:18:30]  I'm going to  That way I avoid all the  You know  Child shit now  But you would be perfect  And the wife  You would be perfect  For like a Soon Yee situation  Oh I need someone that's like  Oh  Where it starts out as your kid  And then you marry it  Miss Andrew  How great would that be  You need the food today  Oh Jesus Christ  How great would that be  It starts out as your kid  So you get that  Nice like  You know  Father daughter thing  Uh huh  And then you marry it  Nice  It's perfect  Yeah  And it's not blood  So  It's not blood 
[02:19:00]  So in the end  It works  Alright  And then you bang it  And then you fucking bang the shit out of her  And then a few  Here's what you do  You go to your adoption agency  You go  Hey  Give me one of these chicks over here  Something that's gonna grow up a little hard  And then  You take her home  You wait till she grows up  And gets the fucking big tits  And juicy ass  And fucking fat pussy 
[02:19:30]  And then you fuck the shit out of her  Uh  Guys  Guys  Whack the bag  Whack the bag  Then you make her your wife  And then a few years go by  And everyone accepts it  It's like  Hey  Don't bitch at me  Weren't you my daughter  And now I'm fucking you  You should thank me  Hey  You should give me a  Hey  Wipe the cum off your face  With the Father's Day card  But then 
[02:20:00]  A bunch of years go by  And then everyone goes  And sees your films  And thinks you're a fucking genius  And no one gives a fuck  No  That is a twisted situation  That went down  Hickory dickory duck  My daughter's sucking my cock  Oh  Jack be nimble  Jack be quick  Hey look  My daughter's sucking my dick  Oh  He's in a Woody Allen movie too  Yeah  He's in the new Woody Allen movie  It's so perfect  He'll blow that  Dice 
[02:20:30]  He's gonna blow  Good for dice and all that  But he'll fuck it up somehow  He doesn't know how to make good movies  You know  I'm gonna  I'll definitely say something  If he's directing me  He goes  Oh  Dice  Stand over here  No asshole  I stand where I want  You ever see Ford Fairlane  It's brilliant  He will fuck it up  He's gonna tell Woody  You know  That he's doing something wrong  So I'm licking my daughter's pussy 
[02:21:00]  At the line  Under bang  Ehhh  It's  What  Yeah  I was over here with my daughter  But I'm over here now  With my wife  See I went from over here now  My daughter's over here  Not my wife  I'm over here now  He's fucking  Alright  So  But that's how it happened  But it was never Woody Allen's daughter 
[02:21:30]  It was never his daughter  Yeah it was  It wasn't  What do you mean  It was never illegally his daughter  No  What happened  He was  This is what happened  And this is where it gets fishy  Uh oh  I'll say that  I  Alright  She should clean that shit  He was dating Mia Farrow  They were never married  Uh huh  Mia Farrow adopted several children  Soon he was one of them  That was it  It was not his daughter  Right  But here's where it gets a little weird  Is he had a child with Mia Farrow 
[02:22:00]  So Woody Allen has a biological son with Mia Farrow  Whose sister by adoption is Soon Yee  And his son who has said  He will never speak to him ever again  Yeah  Said very recently  Wait Woody's son won't speak to him  No  His son is a Rhodes Scholar  You see the tweet  Yeah  On Father's Day  What'd he write  Oh you gotta read it  Oh no  Father's Day  Or as we call it  Uh  Brother-in-law day  Right  Uh  Jesus Christ  Yeah  It went viral 
[02:22:30]  His tweet about it  But that kid is brilliant  He's a Rhodes Scholar  Woody's kid is brilliant  Yeah  Well and Mia Farrow obviously is his mother  Yeah  That kid is fucking a genius  Well he said  That kid said in a recent interview  He and Mia Farrow were interviewed  When the Woody Allen documentary came out  Right  Five months ago  Six months ago  And he said uh  He said um  You know he can  He can justify it all he wants  But he married my sister  And there's nothing more to it than that  Yeah  Wow  Here it is  Happy Father's Day 
[02:23:00]  Or as they call it in my family  Yeah  Happy brother-in-law's day  Yeah you nailed it  Jesus Christ  Hey it's take your daughter to work day  So I fucked her  Jesus Christ  You know if you're gonna get that weird  Like Woody did  Wouldn't you pick like  I don't know  Maybe someone that's a little more attractive  It wasn't a woman who lived in a shoe  I married her  Had a kid with her  And then fucked it  If you're gonna get all that weird 
[02:23:30]  When you find something that's a little hotter  She's not hot  I don't find her attractive  And she's kind of  She's kind of uncomfortable to look at  She seems kind of pushy  Like I watched that  Wild Man Blues documentary with him  And she's  She's a little like bossy  What documentary  I saw something on TV  Like a three-parter  Is that what you're talking about?  Or is there  No I've seen that too  I've seen that  But no there's a documentary called Wild Man Blues  And it's about  It covers his  The tour that he did through Europe 
[02:24:00]  With his jazz band  But they don't interview him really right?  Because he doesn't really give interviews  No the whole movie is him  So it's not really a documentary on his life  It's just a documentary on him  Traveling around with his band  Yeah but there's a lot of  There's a lot of screen time  With him and Suni  Like in the hotel and stuff  And whatever  Alright  I'll check that out  But she's a little pushy  And I was like  It's just kind of weird  She have a little pushy  Oh god  You think they have anime sex? 
[02:24:30]  Oh yeah  I don't know  Oh yeah  What did that hurt me?  Oh  Mr. Woody  Can we play MasterChef again?  Oh Mr. Woody  That hurt me so much  In my hiney  Oh  Yeah  Toll her in the ass Woody  Just bang her  Gooz gooz  She knows how to handle the goo  The goo  The goo  The goo  The goo  Clean it up before your mother gets home 
[02:25:00]  We'll both get in trouble  Does Mia Farrow talk to Sun Yi?  Oh yeah  That's a good question  Oh no fucking way  She probably goes  Thanks a lot  Woody's cock stories  She probably just sends her text messages  Thanks a lot  Yeah thanks  I'd try to make your life better  And you'd fuck me over like this  Jesus Christ  That's weird  You know you can't stop  What you call a love  Yeah the love thing  What are you gonna do?  You're right Ronnie 
[02:25:30]  Well I mean  You're not a rough  And we lost a phone call unfortunately  If he's still listening  He was adopted  Never knew his biological father  I guess I could do the call for him  His biological father dies  And leaves him  According to this guy  Fifteen million dollars  Joe  You gotta take the chance  Oh  But how did he know?  Huh?  Oh he didn't find out  Until the father was dead  And left him all that money  All of a sudden  He gets this big fucking check 
[02:26:00]  And he's like  What the fuck is this?  What the hell story is that?  Turns out it's from his biological father  This is the wrong reason  To try to find your biological parents  It can't be a cash run  You can't go try to find them  Like you're saying yes to a shitty movie  That you don't want to be in  But the money's good  Or whatever  But that's the whole movie you make  I'm going on a cash run  Let's see how it works out  Oh boy  A little wordy in the title  But you know  I'm going on a cash run  Let's see how it works out 
[02:26:30]  That's the name of your film  That's the name of the film  Okay  Well you know  Spoiler alert  Spoiler alert  Spoilers  Spoilers  Look out  You can't make a cool movie like that anymore  Because spoiler alerts  They're everywhere  Spoiler alerts  Yeah they're the worst  If I was a filmmaker  I would just make fucking five different endings  Fuck all you spoiler alert people  There you go  I have intimacy  You saw the wrong version  Plug one in  Right  I have intimacy issues as it is  It's like I don't want to bring two other people into my life now  That I have to figure this out with 
[02:27:00]  I'm still trying to figure out how to communicate health in a healthy way  With my regular family  Do you know what I mean?  Like I'm still trying to figure that out  And like  That means they do some shit too  Yes you're going to throw someone else into the mix  Like that you don't even know  That probably sucks  And try to have a relationship with them  Yeah well everybody thinks you're going to have this fucking field of dreams moment  What a punt catch  Two fucking old people standing in a yard  That would be hilarious  You and you're throwing a  Oh dad  You're throwing a baseball around 
[02:27:30]  Ew how gross is that  Yeah  You're trying to say that  It's not going to be Ray Liotta  No  It's not going to look like Ray Liotta  You're trying to say it doesn't work out that way usually  Never  No  It's not going to look like Ray Liotta  It's going to look like Sala  From Raiders of the Lost Ark  Ugh  Ah shit  Yeah  Bad dates  Bad dates  Can we break now  And do some other shit  Okay  What do you want to talk about next Joe?  I'm going to leave it up to you 
[02:28:00]  Oh man  We never do this but  Give us something you want to talk about next  I want to talk about what fucking cunts people are  Because I'm really on a kick about this  Yep  I'm with ya  I like it  Look at your face light up  Oh man  Jesus Christ  I got a few  Yeah I want to  I'm serious  Alright save it save it  Don't start the fucking  You want the tease?  I was going to tease it  Oh yeah go for the tease  I was going to do the radio tease  And point at Fatso  And then he'll hit something  This is  Oh sorry  This  This is one of the 
[02:28:30]  This is my whole  This is like since I went home  With my mom for the two months  And my dad  I you know had a lot of time to sit and think whatever  And I thought a lot about the business  We all know this business is disgusting  It's a disgusting cutthroat  Awful evil rotten business  But we're in it for better for worse  And I just realized something  There are so many people in this business  Where they don't give a fuck about integrity  Or quality  Or their art or anything  They just want to be known  They just want to be fucking known 
[02:29:00]  Because they're that sick  And self-centered and psychotic  They just want to be known  And they don't even know why  What the fuck did I do to you man  What the fuck  And I've just been thinking about it  And it's just  It's just helped me  Even outside of this business  This doesn't really sound like a tease Joe  This sounds like the  It sounds like the meat of the subject  No that's it  That's it  That's all I'm going to say  Sorry  Was that too long  It's my first time doing a radio tease  That's hilarious  Look how he gets  I know 
[02:29:30]  I don't know  That's it  It's sort of a tease  Alright  Alright  But do you have names and situations  I can't name names  I gotta see these people  Then you did the entire bit already  No no no  I feel like there's a lot here  Okay  Alright we'll see what happens  We'll just see  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel  On Sirius XM  In a world where one vigilante engineer disregards the law of the land 
[02:30:00]  Fuck you and your rules  Only the strong will survive  I'm much bigger man than you are  Marcelino Centeno is  We're gonna fight  Livewire  I'm not afraid of your information  Engineer or no engineer  Livewire looks to take down the bad guys at any cost  You have a difficult personality and you're an asshole  But you're our engineer  You could drop dead right now 
[02:30:30]  I wouldn't give a fuck  Whining and complaining get you nowhere with Livewire  I'm still waiting for a Christmas dinner from five years ago  That's exactly my point you stupid fuck  Little dick motherfucker couldn't even get it hard  No action adventure will get your blood boiling like this  Strap in folks  This is where it gets really exciting  Cause I'm the truth sayer  Livewire  Coming soon to a theater near you 
[02:31:00]  This  Is the Opie and Anthony Show  Sirius XM  For your old we're off the air tricks before 
[02:31:30]  It's funny  Oh well  God damn  Joe DeRosa was ranting  Pretty good  Hey I'm gonna do the show without headphones  Why?  I'm losing my hearing  And my whole family knows it  And they feel bad for me  Really?  Yeah  I think they talk about it behind my back  That's good  Because what this radio show has given me over the years  Is  Sounds like  You know what it sounds like  When you put two shells up to your ears at the beach  Yeah 
[02:32:00]  That's all the time for me  All the time now  All the time  I think my laziness with not cleaning my ears out ever  Might have saved my hearing though  I think if I  Really?  Oh I plugged them up a little?  I think  I think if I just clean my ears I'm gonna be good  What's going on?  You're really losing your hearing?  You're really losing your hearing?  Oh  Just a normal day  Yeah  What?  You're really losing your hearing?  Well I went to  I went to a Brazilian steakhouse  The best  This is a scam going on 
[02:32:30]  I haven't been here since I went to that place  Scam  Because I was sick for three days  Scam  I'm sick this week guys  You got sick from the flu?  No no  I had something going on  It started with a sore throat  And then  I think it was the flu  I'm good now though  Oh jeez  A little clogged  But I'm much better  But I went to a place in Philly  And they treated us great  The service was great  Blah blah blah  But man  People started tweeting  I love Twitter  Because they turn you on to shit  A bunch of people go  I know you're at a Brazilian steakhouse right now  Because I said it on the show 
[02:33:00]  They're like  Pass on the meat for a while  They'll bring the good stuff out eventually  They fucking hit you up with some cheap shit  Oh initially to make you full  This is what I figured out  Why wouldn't they do that?  This is what I figured out  Because it's expensive to go to a Brazilian steakhouse  Because you're like  Holy fuck  I'm going to eat meat  Until I pass out basically  This is what they do  I fucking saw it in front of my eyes  Wow  They start with a really nice piece of meat  Like a sirloin 
[02:33:30]  Really spiced up nice  So you get the first  Wow it's weird doing radio without headphones  Yeah  Fuck my ears  What the hell are you thinking?  I like it with the headphones off  I never wear them until you start taking calls  That felt weird  Now I'm back in my environment  Who gives a fuck about my hearing?  Half the shit that people say around me  I don't want to hear it  You don't want to hear it anyway?  That's a great idea  Ah screw you  I'm turning my hearing aid down  They see me checking my phone and stuff  Because I can't hear the conversation at the table  So thank god for cell phones  You have an out 
[02:34:00]  Like oh no I gotta check on some shit  So it's that bad  That you can't hear conversations at dinner table?  Well  What?  Come on  I can hear  Come on  In my day to day life I can hear everything  But when it's in a crowded restaurant with a lot of other noise  I can't like pinpoint voices anymore  It's all just  It's just all noise  Jeez alright  I guess your ears were made where if you're in loud environments 
[02:34:30]  You could like actually hear individual people  But when you've been doing radio since you were 18 years old  I guess that part of your hearing goes away  Yeah  Yeah but it's not like you've been like doing like tech at concerts since you were 18  Is it that loud in your ears?  Oh my god I've gone to a shitload of concerts too  Not as many in the last 10 years  But fuck I've gone to hundreds of shows  But I mean the actual  Hundreds  The actual doing radio part  It's bad just having the headphones on every day?  Yeah  Well cause then you start like cheating on the volume 
[02:35:00]  And make it a little louder  Your ears aren't made to have an amplification device on them every fucking day  It's just not good  Right  Right  It's Jesus  Yeah  Really fast on the Brazilian steakhouse  So thanks to the people on Twitter for real  They break out the really nice piece of meat to start you off  So you're like oh fuck  It was so worth coming to this Brazilian steakhouse  $100 a head or whatever the fuck it turns out to be  After drinks and everything  So you have that first slice  And you're like oh 
[02:35:30]  And then they attack you  So they don't even give you time to think  Right  Like you don't even have time to think  Whatever they're  You're hungry  You've been saving your appetite all day  This is what people do  When you go to one of these places  So then they hit you with the shitty chicken  But they wrap it in bacon  To make it like  No this is good chicken  And we're making it even better  Man  It's shitty chicken  It is  The bacon wrapped chicken stinks every time  Right  It never is good  And then they break out the steak again  But now it's the fattier one  Not the good fatty 
[02:36:00]  Not the marbly fatty  Oh man  And then they break out  I don't know  I'm trying to think  Like a sausage  Sausage in general  It's like whatever  It was a shit  And then they eventually come back to the good shit again  So the people on Twitter told me  Wait it out  Wait it out  You'll thank me again  Do they look at you like  Oh this guy's onto our shit  Motherfucker  Like they got the knife and the thing  Do you want some  Yeah  No  Yeah  They look at you like  Yeah  Alright  Right  I'm trying to think  But it's like  Every third or fourth  Meet  They come out on the big skewer 
[02:36:30]  With the steak knives  By the way  That would chop your head off  No problem  These  These knives they use  Are ridiculously sharp  They hit you with a good one  They hit you with about  Two or three shittier ones  Shittier  And then they go back  To the good one  Just in case you're onto them  And then back to the shittier  And then  Then it's all shittier  By the way  Because by that point  You're bloated  And you don't even know  What you're doing anymore  Wow  Yeah  I have noticed  At those places  When I'm disgustingly full  And I feel like  I'm going to puke  All of a sudden 
[02:37:00]  They're like  Would you like some  Filet  And you're like  What the fuck man  Where was that at that  Yeah  At that point  You're so full  You're like  No  So now you're passing  On the filet  So they get  The filet goes a long way  In those places  They filled you up  With shit  So you don't eat  The good stuff  Not shit  But just shittier  You know what I'm saying  It is brilliant  You would never eat  Chicken wrapped in bacon  If you knew  There was a nice filet  Waiting around the corner  What is this  Wendy's  Yeah  But you wouldn't  How shit does that  I like chicken  I eat chicken 
[02:37:30]  Every fucking day  Chicken is relatively cheap  You know  Compared to the nice  Filet  And I didn't know this  Until people on Twitter  Said dude  I go to these places  I'm a professional foodie  They like to call themselves  Foodies  Foodies  And they're like  Trust me  Wait it out  They'll hit you good  They'll hit you good  To get you all into it  And then they're gonna  Hit you up with some  Less desirable meats  Alright  Well I'm gonna  I'm gonna  I'm going to  Instate this policy  But they attack you too  They come from all directions 
[02:38:00]  So you don't even know  What the fuck's going on  You're confused  So what you should do  Take that nice filet  Because that's what  They start with  And then turn that  Fucking paddle over  Some places are green  Or red paddles  The place we went  I think it was  Yes please  No  And no thanks  I think  So you go right  To no thanks  And just sit there  And go alright  Let me see what  The fuck's going on here  Yeah  Let me see what  The fuck is actually  Being brought to me  Right now  Yeah exactly  Because they wrap  A lot of their stuff  In bacon  Because they know  They're hiding 
[02:38:30]  A world of hurt  Fuckers man  Alright  That's great advice  I'm doing it  You know  It's not my thing  I mean  I'm just passing  Along what I learned  Yeah  Well but it's your thing though  That's great though  Because I never knew that  Go now  Go now  You'll have a great experience  But wait it out  I'll just pass  By the way  I also want to applaud  My brother-in-laws  I went all in  I was like  I'm going for the experience  I ate like a fucking pig  My two brother-in-laws  Went an extra hour  After I did  I'm amazed  Just amazed 
[02:39:00]  They ate another hour of meat  Were they sweating?  The meat sweats?  They said they couldn't think  They felt like they were drunk  They got drunk off of meat  Yeah  We had a few cocktails  But nothing crazy  They felt like they got  Drunk from meat  They had so much  The sodium intake  I feel like I'm going to  There was one  Right near my old apartment  That's the one I went to  With my uncles  And my cousins  And we had shit stories  For days after that place  It was good though  I used to eat there 
[02:39:30]  Until I literally felt  I was going to throw up  And the food was great  But I just felt  I was going to throw up  But  Did you ever throw up from  I've literally thrown up  From eating too much  Oh right never  We  Drinking too much  When I was  When I was an asshole  Fraternity guy  We all went to  Spring break together  And we went to  One of those  All you can eat buffets  And we ate  Until we puked  And we actually  Were humming  We are the world  As we were  This is a true story  While we were puking  In the bathroom  And then we came back out 
[02:40:00]  And continued eating  That isn't very sensitive  No no  I uh  Yeah when I was in college  We went on spring break  And one night  My buddy challenged me  To an eating contest  He's like  I can eat more than you  And I was really like  Proud of how much  I could eat  And I was like  No you fucking can't man  I really took it  Like a challenge  And he's like  Let's do it  And we just  We were at a Taco Bell  We started going at it  We ate  We each ate six tacos  First at the Taco Bell  Then I ate a Choco Taco  A Choco Taco 
[02:40:30]  What's a Choco Taco  I don't know  I am trying to avoid  The fast food place  The dessert one  Choco Taco  That's great  Then we went to  We went to 7-Eleven  That's the  I never knew this existed  No really  They sell on ice cream trucks  They're not just like  At fast food places  I've seen them  On the ice cream truck  They're great  The shells made a cone  Of waffle cone  There's ice cream in the middle  It's dipped in chocolate  It's great  So then we went to 7-Eleven 
[02:41:00]  And we've got a bunch of shit there  We're eating it  And went somewhere else  Got a bunch of shit  And the last stop was  I got McDonald's  And he got Waffle House  Yeah  And I got cheeseburgers  At McDonald's  And he got a fucking egg  Runny egg sandwich  At Waffle House  Ah  And we're in the car  We're like  This is it  We were so sick  And I started eating  The cheeseburgers  And he bit the  Egg sandwich  Waffle House  And he turned to me  And he goes  Please let's stop 
[02:41:30]  And as he said  As he said it  Had egg yolk  Running all down his face  Into his beard  That was disgusting  It was so gross  He goes  Please let's stop  Let's stop  And I go  Alright alright  Do you tap out  Do you tap out  And he's like  I tap out  You win  And I go  Alright I won  And I like  Jumped out of the car  And just started  Fucking throwing up  That's great  It was disgusting  That's awesome  But it's fun to do that  I've never eaten  Until I puked  It's not  Does not feel good  Because I just can't  Get any more food in me 
[02:42:00]  Well you gotta  You muscle through it  Yeah I guess  Here's a guy  Here's a guy  Jim in Newark  He went to a  Brazilian barbecue  Was it one of those  Brazilian steakhouses  Where it's all you could eat  Yeah there's a joint  I'm 21  We used to go there  With my co-workers  Once a month  And you know  They come over  They bring the meats  On the steers  Like you said  Everything's wrapped in bacon  And I ate  We ate for a good 
[02:42:30]  45 minutes  They probably came around  Two different times  From the steers  About 45 minutes later  I had a gallbladder attack  And I was in the hospital  For three days  Had to get my gallbladder removed  You needed surgery  Because of your  Fucking  Piggadness  Yeah  But I mean  When you go to these places  You're not just  Picking around  Even the women  We went with  Were eating  Just all fucking  Packed out 
[02:43:00]  And they're all in  All in good shape  And you know  They take care of themselves  But man  They fucking went all in  I was proud of them  Yeah you gotta  I was proud of them  You gotta  I mean if you're gonna do it  You do it  You know  But he lost his gallbladder  Because of one of these places  Wow  It's like a war injury  Fuck you Gary  Gary  Is that his name Gary?

I came back early  I easily could have  I easily could have  Taken yesterday  Easily  And then if you take  Four out of the five  You take the fifth  And go  You know what  I'll just start  Fresh Monday  But this fucking asshole  Is emailing my agent  Going we want to know  If he's coming back tomorrow  Fuck you  I got sick days  I'm using them  Did you request  The days off?

And even if I was faking  It's none of your fucking business  Probably should add a note  Yeah  Holy shit  That pissed me off  And I didn't even know  About this until yesterday  Because I was  I was so sick  I wasn't checking  Corporate email or nothing  So all of a sudden  I open my corporate email  To catch up a little bit  And I see all these emails  Going back and forth 
[02:45:00]  And then my agent's like  I got an email  From the company  And they're wondering  If you're coming back tomorrow  I can't believe that  And then I want to tell my agent  Bob Eben  Go fuck yourself  How about you tell the company  To go fuck themselves  That's why you're playing  Into their stupid game  I need to  They want to know  If you're coming back  To work tomorrow  So I'm emailing you now  Unbelievable  Holy fuck  Unbelievable  Who do they think  Generated the sufficient  Dollar revenue  To start this network  Exactly  Thank you  That's right

[02:58:30]  Right  And here's my problem with it  If you're  Number one  If you're a comic that kills  You don't care  Whether you're a guy or a girl  And you kill  You're like whatever  I don't give a shit  And this is what I'm tired of  And I don't say this to pick on women  It's just in this particular case  It pertains to women  It bothers me when somebody says something like that  And then female comics that aren't that funny  The ones that aren't that funny  I mean  Come out and go  We can do it too  It's like well  You know what  I could go to a fucking bench pressing contest 
[02:59:00]  And stand there and go  I could do that  Fucking do it  Do you know what I'm saying  Like get up there and do it  If you can do it  And if you can't  Then shut up  And the ones that can  Like you or Lisa or whoever  Oh thanks  They don't say anything  Are you just saying Tammy  Because she's here  Right that's right  No serious  She was wondering that  I saw it in her eyes  Right you see  I go what  Is he going to say me  You just mentioned her  Because she's here  Who is this  Tammy's fucking fine  I'm not just saying that 
[02:59:30]  I'm serious  Like you know  You kill  And Lisa kill  There's a lot of  Really killer chicks out there  I wrote my act  Not as a chick  I wrote it as a comic  And then I happened to be a woman  Wow you just nailed it  That's why  That's exactly  That was the whole thing  You just nailed it  Because I've been trying to figure out  What that is always  You see these female comics  And they're  Yeah they're not just writing an act  It's like oh I gotta talk about my period  And my overbearing mother  Right  And that's not my problem  That I'm still single at 35  We've all heard the exact same jokes  From a million different female comics 
[03:00:00]  And the defense  The defense of that shit  Will be like  Like if you go  Ah women  They talk about their periods  A lot of female comics will go  Well if you had your period  You talk about  It's like guess what  There is an equivalent  To guy period jokes  They're called dick jokes  Masturbation jokes  I think  They are  Jerk off jokes  Are about the same  Yeah  And dick jokes  Are the go to  You stink as a comic insult  This guy's all fucking dick jokes  That's all he does  Is dick jokes  Right  It is the go to thing 
[03:00:30]  To trash people about  In comedy  Right  And it's like  I'm so fucking tired of it  But it's great on a Dixie cup  Here's the thing with Adam  First of all  If you said it  If Bill Burr said it  Bobby  I would be offended  Because I'm like  They're monsters  And I think I would feel bad  Adam Carolla  To me  Isn't that funny  So I don't really  Give a shit  What Adam thinks  About Jim  That's a good point  And he has never really been  At  I've never seen him 
[03:01:00]  At my show  So I can't take it personally  Because it's not like he  Jerry Lewis said it  Probably like a week  After I did the telethon  And I was like  Is that me?  Wait what happened there?  Was it me?  Oh man  Like I did the telethon  And then Jerry Lewis said it  And then that's when Jerry Lewis said it  But he had a giant dome  Like his head was like a beach ball  So I can't really think  That his thoughts were connecting  In his head  So I didn't know  He really got uncomfortable  To look at on TV  He looks normal again now  I know  I know  It's really rough  He's a  But he's also the kind of guy  Where he'd be like 
[03:01:30]  He was great  He would be like  Black's on funny  And then if you were a black guy  He'd be like  Really?  Not you sweetheart  I don't mean you  He seems like that kind of guy to me  Traditionally  Blacks are not funny  He'd be like  Yeah what?

I think it was like  2004  I was just coming off  The last comic  Right  So everybody was still alive  Like Ed McMahon  And Edie Stephen  Edie and Robert Goulet  And I'm like getting out  Going how did I overshoot stardom  Like somehow I missed it 
[03:02:30]  Yeah on that end  Completely  I just missed it  Oh man  Those telethons  You gotta climb a ladder  I think  That's hilarious  Right Alpy  You miss all the good parties  You just end up in a steam room  With all those people  So listen  Wait what Ed's referring to  I also was on the MDA telethon  Oh okay  But I was on the local feed  And I was an idiot fucking DJ  On the top of a ladder  Answering phone calls  Oh my god  Call in now for your pledges  You know when they went local  Then you got to see me  I didn't even get the national spot  I'm not gonna get off this ladder  Until we raise  Wow

[03:18:00]  It adds ten pounds  It doesn't make it  Look bigger  If you're adding ten pounds  On your body in general  It would make your penis  Look bigger  No it would just  Make you look bulkier  You think  It doesn't really do anything  It's a horse shit  Lie  His penis is fucking tiny  That fat women made up  Did you freeze frame it  And look at it  Like I had to go  It looks tiny  And I didn't want to see it  I mean you didn't have to  It is tiny  It doesn't help  That he's got that  Giant bush around  What does that do  To distract  Right  Like that  No I think  That makes it look smaller  That's an Asian thing  Yeah clear out that brush

[03:27:00]  Like you get crazy  Don't you feel like you could  Doesn't it feel like a viable career  When you watch that  You're like  This is kind of good  Why do people love Breaking Bad so much  It's just  Because I'm out  I haven't seen any  It's just  If you watch one  You'll see why  Like I can't even tell  The pilot just hooked you immediately  You're like  What the fuck is going on  And then he's just great  Bryan Cranston's fucking great in it  The story's good  It's like  It's very stressful to watch  Like oh no  What's he doing  They really know how to do 
[03:27:30]  The cliffhanger very well  It takes  It has not jumped the shark  By any stretch  Except that it's really hard  For me to see  Billy and Lavelle  It's really  Billy coming to the door  It's like  Hey  Check the water  Or something  Jesus Christ  I hate that  When it happens  Is he a recurring character now?  He is now  It's like he's been in  Like three or four episodes  It is great  It is great  Make a fucking mess  Jesus Christ  You make a fucking mess  There you go  There he is  Can I help you?

[03:29:30]  And tell me what happened  Oh it's got no spoilers  Ant remember when I said  That the bus monitor  Made $44,000  Shut up  I don't want to hear it  She's now up to $49,000  She just made another $5,000  Since we just mentioned it  You guys publicly humiliate me  She made $5,000  Just start  Just start heeping  Is that right?  She made another $5,000  In the last half hour  Jesus  Look at her  Fuck this broad  Watch her get hot  Watch her take that money  Oh man that would be hilarious  All the guys at school  $5,000 in about 15 minutes  $5,000 in 15 minutes  Cause now everyone's awake 
[03:30:00]  She's not old enough yet  But in a couple years  Would you make out  With her against the wall?  No  Can I tell you though  I have seen comics  Bang retards  Yeah  I did work with a comic  Who literally brought  This retarded  So is the person  They're banging  Right  No for right  For right  For this guy  There was this little  Retarded group  That came to the show  And they were like  They were nice  Like this girl  Had like on her pajamas  And you know  Like those old  Kind of kimono-y pajamas  And after the show  He was signing autographs 
[03:30:30]  I thought wow  That's really nice  He's taking time  I was like the feature  After this  Back in condo days  Right  So after I go back  To the condo  He comes in  With this girl  And I'm thinking  This is weird  Maybe he needed a ride  Cause he didn't have a car  Sure as hell  He goes in the room  And he calls her  Back in there  They start making this  If you ever heard  A retard get pounded  It's absolutely horrible  Right  And then she leaves  And he literally  Comes out like  He's smiling and stuff  And I go  Dude  You're  I don't even understand 
[03:31:00]  Like  Why would you cheat  On your wife with that  And he goes  Who will believe it  Built in alibi  But she was legit retarded  For real  Not  No not like  Not like Mongol  You know what I mean  But like  Like  Obviously slow  What level  Obviously  You know really  Like she got a check  A check  She got a check  A woman  Oh boy  She got a check  From the government  Oh I'm Adam Carolla  Look out  Whoa  You know  Women aren't funny  All they're good for 
[03:31:30]  Is trimming my eyebrows  I don't know the difference  Between him and Gilbert Godfrey  Really  Like it sounds the same  Looks the same  Oh my god  She's back on TV  Hold on  Oh no  Oh yeah  You gotta play it  There could be a silver lining  To all those  Economist  We're glad for Karen Klein  As we continue to look at her  She is going to go to Disneyland  And she does have nine people  To bring with her  So good for her  Okay  Wait but didn't she say  I don't want to take a long  There we go  There could be a silver lining  To all those economic problems  In Europe  Oh I thought she was like 
[03:32:00]  Having a vertation  I know  That's all this  And that's all this  Fucking culture is  It's okay now  Because you have money  Yeah yeah yeah  It's ridiculous  That's okay now  That somebody said  They were going to cut you  You have money now  Jesus Christ  I've been saying this for years  It's a conspiracy  There you go  There you have it  People wonder why  The fucking bankers  Are taking everything over  Go make some money  Everything will be fine  Yeah just make some fucking money  You know what the world bank is Joe 
[03:32:30]  You know what the world bank is  Yeah look it up  Dude  I was on the phone  With Burr last night  For 40 minutes  Talking about the fucking bankers  Ugh  At the end I go  Billy what do we do  He goes  I don't fucking know  Ugh  He just stinks  And by the way  That read Todd's story  That was nothing  I have one locked  In my fucking basement  And we were threatening  To hit her on the head  With a rock  If she didn't blow us off  How sad is it 
[03:33:00]  That you had to stay  On the phone with Bill Burr  For 40 minutes  Because your career  Is not going that well  If your career  Was going better  You would have hung up on it  No I was doing Bobby  Talking to Bill  That was Bobby  Not tired Bobby  I feel and look like  An asshole right now  Hey I got a note  From Amy Schumer  Who needs a little plug  See how I got out of that  Did she send a note in  Yeah  From a plane  Oh wow  From a plane  Alright well then  Let's stop everything  I guess  Drop it in  I guess she's not hurting  That badly  That she didn't call  The show  Yeah 
[03:33:30]  But passed on a note  That she's taping  Her hour  In San Fran tomorrow  And tickets are  Available online  So  Does that bother you  What  I see  That she sent a note in  Yeah  From a plane  Yeah  It's mildly irritating  Why  It's mildly irritating  And we'll preface this  By saying we all like  Amy Schumer  But why  Why  Yeah I'm friends with Amy  But yeah  Don't hold back  What's up  That's annoying  Why  Cause  When you  Had to plug something 
[03:34:00]  You didn't send notes  Who was she  Hugh Hefner  You never sent notes  Did you John  Dolly hold my calls  I'm gonna be very busy  Right now  If you could send a note  Into Opie and Anthony  Tell them to plug this thing  I think what's going on here  Is when  She dropped it like propaganda  When Joe needed  World War 2  To plug something  He would leave his sick mom  In Philly  To drive all the way up here  You're goddamn right I did  I was in a goddamn car  At 4 o'clock in the morning  Trying to get up here by 6  She's not your real mom anyway  Though  She doesn't  I'm just kidding 
[03:34:30]  Holy shit  We made a pact with Joe  That we keep everything positive  Touch him  I'm rubbing him  You fucked it all up  She's a huge  She's a huge fan of you  She was very excited  When she found out  I became friends with you  I'm dead serious  I'm dead serious  I swear to god  Really  I swear to god  You don't know how to take it  Like I'm just waiting  For the stand  No I swear to god  She was like a huge fan  Of the last comic  Up through  Maybe the season after you  When she stopped watching  What was the season after you  Cause I'm trying to figure out  When I stopped watching  Cause I definitely watched  Your season  You know  I really stopped 
[03:35:00]  But I think it was  Josh Blue  I never saw it after us  Cause I got like  I felt like I was  It's like watching  Your rapist  Yeah  I watched the Josh Blue  It didn't work out  Too well for him  He's like he's killing it  Oh he is  I don't know  He's making like  Shit loads of money  At colleges  He's doing really well  In fact I got a note  Here from Josh  I just got something to plug  Can I plug something for Josh  You're mad that Amy  Just sent a note  Amy's at that stage  With us where she  Can just send notes  She can just send  A fucking note  You're almost there Joe  That's awesome 
[03:35:30]  You don't have tips  You can send me a note  Listen next time  I'll just tweet  What I need you guys  To talk about  Oh yeah  We'll get right to it  Amy sends a note  I gotta meet you  In a turn style  And then we have that  Awkward like  No I really do  Watch out the show  Really you sure  I really don't want you  To feel obligated  You know why  I wouldn't send a note  Let me tell you  Why I wouldn't send a note  Why Joe  Because I love  Being on this show  With you guys  See how he  And he knew  I was gonna be here  Exactly  And you guys  Are my friends 
[03:36:00]  And I like coming in here  And hanging out  With all of you  And it's a great  Fucking time  Dates and plugs  Are secondary  To having a good time  On the show  Alright so this is  What you do  Don't plug anything  As we end the show  I won't plug shit  To prove that  You don't fucking  Come in here  I don't need to plug anything  I really don't  Is he sweating  I don't need to plug  I got dates  I'll come back later  And plug them  We're not  Just plug them  I don't care  We're not  That's the key to that  Or not  When I texted Rowan  When I texted Rowan 
[03:36:30]  I said  Hey dude  I'm backing down  Would love to just come in  And hang out with the guys  Right  Nothing about  I gotta push this  I gotta push that  I gotta plug this  I gotta plug that  I love Joe  I unplug  Should we put Amy Schumer  On the fuck-go list  It's always the weirdest thing  We might have to  It's the weirdest thing  Because you guys gave me  The last time I was here  Was like more than a year ago  And it was so  Guy goes  Come in any time  Call us  And then you don't want  To take advantage  And I think like  Most you go  I don't want to just call them  And take advantage  I don't want to just show up  Every time  And then you wait so long 
[03:37:00]  That people forget about you  Oh shit  We just waited too long  We all live in the any time world  On the pay me no mind list  It means nothing  We all get hit with the any time  Come on the show  Any time  What does that really mean  Nothing  It puts it in your court  Where you're gonna look like an asshole  By calling and going  Hey I'm rolling  They said any time  I'm ready for my any time  I'm ready for my any time  We all live in that world  No matter what you do  Yeah nobody  That like vague 
[03:37:30]  Vague invite  Like  I love when you see like  Letterman say it  Call him out on it  Yeah I love when you hear  Like Letterman say it  Come see us any time  Really  Really  I'm just dropping  On the Letterman show  Hey you said  Come see us  Yeah  Come back see us any time  That's what that woman does  That stalks him  Every time  Yeah maybe  Maybe he  Maybe he said it to her  Know how many times  We've heard  We gotta get you  On the show soon  What does that mean  That seems to mean  The same thing  When you say it  Huh  Seems to mean 
[03:38:00]  The same thing  As when you say it  Yeah  We play the game too  Yes you're right  Well that's what I felt like yesterday  I'm calling myself out on it  But it happens to all of us  I know  I swear to god  That's what I felt yesterday  That's why I'm like  Look no no no  Really you don't have to  It's okay  Don't feel obligated  Because you're seeing me  I saw you before you saw me  So I could turn  I could have easily turned around  You would have never known  Oh that was  So that was my first move  Then I would have been like  That dick  You just moved right by me  Fucking guy  And then it was true 
[03:38:30]  Like I didn't  I wasn't on Twitter as much  And I know that  People were like tweeting you  That you should be on the show  And I saw that  When I caught up with my Twitter  Right  Why are we going through this  How can you tell  You have so many followers  Like how do you pay attention to that  I can't read them all anymore  I know  And then you become like  So narcissistic  You don't even read your feed  And then I  Like you just go  What am I going to say  I don't  Just spew shit out  And don't even take any in  At all  And I've hired people  To read my tweets ahead of time  So my feelings aren't hurt  That's good  Are you serious 
[03:39:00]  That's hilarious  And they block people  Before I even see them  You hired somebody for him  Yeah  Because my feelings get hurt  That's funny  His words hurt  Yeah well no  They say some real cunty  Maybe we can raise some money for you  You hire a person  And they filter through all that shit  Let's raise some money for you  That's what we can do  We can put you on a bus  And read you your tweets  These guys actually think  They get to me  Nope  Not anymore  Joe's fine  What?  Oh you're joking?  Of course I am  Do you honestly 
[03:39:30]  If he was doing that  Do you think he'd say it on the air?  Yeah  See the stuff that's really happening  I really feel like  Yeah  Can't take it  You can ditch it up  Can't take it  The stuff that's really happening  You'll never know about  Of course  That's funny  I didn't know that  You gotta take this  Because my feelings  Get hurt  That's always been my biggest  Show business mistake  Is I'd really just air it all out  I have no line between  Real life and stage  It's the please like me  Fucking terrible 
[03:40:00]  I actually feel bad  For the people  That I obsessively hate  I feel bad  I'm like wow really  You're wasting that much time  On hating me  140 characters  Look into your life  Do something man  I feel bad  You're wasting time  Haters gonna hate  I get the  I get the  I get the occasional hate shit  We all do it  But the obsessive ones  That's sad  That's my real thought on that  The last time I was in here  You weren't here  I'm like real  You're wasting that much time  On my dumb career  Because I think you're talking 
[03:40:30]  Directly to them  Like somehow  Who cares  That you hate  Like I'm sure that we probably  Get more hate  Off of stuff  Than you to get love  Because people don't have time  To give you love  No one gives compliments  Oh no I know all that  I get a lot of compliments  Of course you do  Of course you do  Why would I think otherwise Joey  I get a lot of nice tweets  From people  It's usually very positive  Really old broads  That are so excited  You want to bang them  Ah they need something  In that clam  Martha Ray  I see the guys that are  You know they start up 
[03:41:00]  A new Twitter account  Every day  I feel really bad  For those people  That's like weird  That what  What do you mean  You block them  And then they fucking  Start up a whole nother account  Just to go back at you  Oh yeah  You see they got  Zero followers  But over and over again  They're following zero people  They have one tweet  And it's them bashing you  It's like oh okay  The occasional hate  Is that  That's human nature obviously  But the ones that are  Obsessive about  I'm like wow  What is wrong with your life  That you've got to  Continue doing this  It's weird  People are really  Really 
[03:41:30]  Really lonely  Well and you never know  What's going to upset them  You know  Like I swear to god  I had like a ten minute  Argument with my father  Over whether Wendy Williams  Was Tyler Perry  Or not  Because like he totally  Believed it  People started  That's funny  People started sending me  All these things  She's a monster  We love Wendy Williams  How dare you say that  About Wendy  What is that  You should write him  Well it's  You should call him  Yeah I remember  I trashed  Britney Spears once  On CNN  Which I actually  Wouldn't even do that now

[03:55:30]  We'll see you next time  Later  Anytime  Whenever that is  War injury  Fuck you Gary  Fuck  The Opie and Anthony show  Is pretty much over  Pretty much over  Pretty much over  But if you feel like  Sticking around  After One Day Live  Is next  And now  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is After One Day Live  Here's your host 
[03:56:00]  Sam Roberts  Oh yeah  It's After Opie and Anthony Live  Now  I understand it's an abrid show  Because Opie and Anthony  Decided  Oh  They need to take  Their precious time  Ending their precious show  Everybody just wants to hear  Opie and Anthony  For so long  Well you know what  We still have some time  For After Opie and Anthony Live  And  It gets even more exciting  Because  Jeff Dye is here  Boom  What's up Jeff  Now Jeff  That's my new catchphrase 
[03:56:30]  Boom  That's good  Have you worked on it  For a long time  I think I stole it  From John Madden  Oh  Well he's not on TV  As much as he used to be  That's right  Now it's mine  To carry it over  You're headlining  Caroline's this weekend  Yes sir  So that's big  It's carolines.com  For all your tickets  And everything  So now that's out of the way  But you  Like  It was funny  When Greg Charles  Was like  Hey  Will you take  Jeff Dye  On the after show  I was like  Yeah of course  Because I knew you already  Because I've actually  I've seen your MTV show  Oh nice  You have Money from Strangers  Yeah 
[03:57:00]  I was stumbling  Because there's a lot of  Horrible TV shows  Sure  A lot of pregnant teens  On television nowadays  Yeah and I was like  What's this MTV show  Like I'm like  Oh okay  I'll give it a chance  And I was actually laughing  Oh I'm flattered here  Yeah smart stuff  Really mature  Well that's the thing  Weird jokes  I'm sitting there  It's right up my alley  I'm 28 years old  I don't need to watch this  Maybe when I was in high school  But this is gonna be  One of those bullshit shows  Yeah  And it's actually hilarious  Well thank you very much  Yeah  Is it real?  Yeah it's all real  Everything  Originally we had it casted  Like so like  You know like on Cash Cab 
[03:57:30]  Like they  They have to make sure  Someone crazy  Isn't getting in the cab  So they like pre-screen them  Kind of  Well after like two of those  Pre-screened people  Wandering down the street  I was like  This is stupid  Like it's gonna help  The reputation of the show  If I literally just get strangers  It's called money  So we just started  Finding strangers  And then it's helped  The show immensely  Because now we have  Old ladies going into places  Or we have  Like it's just more random  It's more fun  Well that's what the show is  Like Jeff goes up  He finds random people  On the street  And then they put  One of those MTV  Jesus  These banners are falling down  On top of me  It's getting wild in here 
[03:58:00]  I don't know if you people  Can see this  But they are setting up  For a Jonas Brothers show  And there is posters  Falling all over the joint  It's a big event  The Ron and Fed show  Is a daily Jonas Brothers concert  That's how they build their show  That's how they describe it  But money from strangers  Is Jeff finding random people  On the street  And then he's like  I'll give you money  If you do some stupid shit  That we tell you to do  Exactly  They put a hidden camera  And a mic on them  And then I guess  You're watching from a van  Yeah I'm in a van  With all the monitors  From all the hidden cameras  It's not as glamorous 
[03:58:30]  As it sounds  And they go into a  And they go into a store  Or whatever it is  And just do really dumb shit  Whatever we want them to do  So when you're having them  Do tasks  Because more tasks  Are you know  Different money  Sure  How do you know  Like those aren't  You figure out the tasks  Ahead of time  No we don't  So how do you know  If you're like  You have a great idea  And you just had them  Do it for 50 bucks  And you're like  That should have been  Like a $300 task  You're welcome into  The brain of my life  There's not a lot  Of organization  There's not  Like we literally  Are just  That's the beauty 
[03:59:00]  Of the show  The guy who created  His name is Rob Anderson  And he is a maniac  And that's what I love  About Rob too  Is that he's like  Yeah just have fun  Let's go wild  With this stuff  And then also  Like if he thinks  Something might not  Be appropriate  For like MTV  Or television  He's like  Just do it  And then if we have  To cut it out later  We will  It's not a live show  That's the best feeling  Ever  Yeah exactly  So like it's just  Total creative freedom  And total like  We can be as ornery  Or as rude as we want  Which is fun  We can curse  We can do basically  Whatever we want  Has there been anything  That you've had to cut out  Like you can  Yeah we've had a few things 
[03:59:30]  One is  There was a  I don't even know  If I'm allowed to talk  About this  But I don't give a shit  Nobody listens anyway  Yeah it's fine  I'm shooting this out  Into the nowhere right  Yeah just me and you  There's people  There's people  It was a man  I think  Dressed as a woman  In a Halloween store  And this was not  One of your people  He was just there  No this was just  An employee  Who was like  You're not allowed  To address that  I'm a giant man  Dressed as a woman  Like we're supposed  To just pretend  Like oh it's  So it wasn't  Like a Halloween costume 
[04:00:00]  No that's the worst part  It's just a transgender  Like or I don't even know  Transgender  It was a cross dresser  Something  But not a good one  Yeah and I have  A running theme on the joke  Where it's very funny  Actually it's kind of  Jim Florentine-esque  To call like male women  And call women males  Okay sure  So like if I was  Talking to you  You'd be like  Listen lady  I don't want any trouble  I'm like that's funny to me  Because it's the wrong gender  Excuse me ma'am  It's disrespectful  It's funny  That's why it's great  Well that's the problem  With this is that  It was kind of  A sensitive subject  For a cross dresser 
[04:00:30]  And he seems like  The way you're describing him  Like he's in the early stages  Of cross dressing  Right right  No hormone therapy yet  Well that's the beauty  Of a cross dresser  Or a transgender person  Like you can get the boobs  You can get the nose  You can get even the genitals  But you can't get  Like a shoulder surgery  You're still a giant husky  Just rounding out  Those shoulders  Yeah there's nothing  You can do  So it's just this giant  Man dressed as a woman  And so I thought  It's funny to just  Keep going  Sir I heard you  Sir I heard you  Over and over  And this 
[04:01:00]  I thought she was  Going to get beat up  And it was like  A cute little dainty girl  That was put in the store too  So we had to cut all that  Because they were going to sue  And all this  Really  Well yeah  Like it's so funny  We can  We're so offensive  About stuff  On that show  And like borderline  We're racist  Sometimes  I mean  Because it's just  All in good fun  So like  Don't even worry about it  The joke's on you  It's all in good fun  Anti-semitic  Racist  Sexist  Immature  It's like those kids  Yelling at that bus monitor  On the school bus  It's all in fun 
[04:01:30]  But the problem is  Like there's just  This sensitivity  For like  Anything that might be  Homosexual  Oh really  Like the  Sexuality is worse than race  Worse than everything  Wow  That's what we found  At least  Shoot and I  There seemed to be  Like a zero tolerance  For that  And we're like  Some of that stuff's  Pretty clever  I think if it's good enough  Like it's like a  It's like a rape joke  Or something like that  Like sure  Maybe you shouldn't  Joke about that  But there are  There's circumstances  Where a rape joke's funny  That was the great  Patrice O'Neill  The late great Patrice O'Neill 
[04:02:00]  When he was on Fox News  And he was directly  Questioned  Have you ever heard  A funny rape joke  And Patrice was like  I've heard a few  Yes  As a matter of fact  I have heard a few  Rape jokes  That are funny  So  But there's never been a fight  No  Kid almost got cut  Cut?  Yeah  What was it  Canter's  What's the famous  Deli here  No  Canter's  Los Angeles  Cats  Deli  Yeah  This guy  Wanted to  Stab him  Oh I think  That's the one I saw  That kid kind of sucked though  He wasn't following 
[04:02:30]  All your orders  I don't know what  That kid's deal was  I asked him his name  I don't know if he was  In a gang or what  He was like  My name's Cheeto  I was like  That's not your name  First of all  Why are you playing  It breezy with me  Let's do this  Yeah  But yeah  And something weird  Happened with that kid too  Where he had  Some sort of tattoo  Where the guy  Who wanted to cut him  Went from being like  Listen man  We got a problem  To being like  Where you traveling from  Which I've never seen  Oh was that the one where  You had the kid  Go into the deli  And ask the guy  Who ran the deli  To give him sandwich 
[04:03:00]  But make it so the meat  Was on the outside  Meat on the outside  Bread on the inside  Like meat  Bread meat  That's funny  Because at first  It's like  What  That's weird  But they made the kid  Like do it  Fifty times  He just kept insisting  The guy's like  We don't do meat  On the outside  And the guy wanted to fight him  And he's like  How about bread meat  Bread meat bread  And the guy's like  You can get whatever  You pay for  Alright then let's do  Meat bread meat  Then if that's the  And the guy was like  Listen  We don't fucking do meat  He was very upset about it  Yeah  Well that's one thing  About the show 
[04:03:30]  Is like some people  That if you haven't seen it  A lot of people might think  Like oh  They'll probably just do  Big over the  Like punk  They're always blowing things up  And going big  Ours is actually kind of subtle  We have like Joe Mandy  And Noah Garfinkel  And Scotty Landis  One of our head writers  Who's in the van with me  But you never see him  He comes up with some  Brilliant ideas  They're just throwing you notes  Yeah  Because he's so funny  It's just great to have  An extra mind in there  But he is like the mastermind  In a lot of scenarios  And once we all get  Working together  But what I was going to say  Is like  Some of the funniest things  Are the most subtle  Stupid jokes 
[04:04:00]  Like going to win  The grocery store  And asking them  Like go up to that employee  And ask if they're open  Like that sounds stupid  But like you go up  To the lady  And he's like  Hey are you guys open?  And the lady's just looking around  Like what are you  Fucking stupid?  Yes we're open  Like what's wrong with you?  Because they don't really  Catch wind of it either  Like I think I also saw  The one where they were  In a restaurant  And somebody was like  Kicked their chair over  Right  And they're like  That wasn't me  It was a ghost  Yeah and you made him  You made him do this weird  Like ghost  Yeah yeah  And everybody in the restaurant  Hears him  And is just looking at him  Like what is this? 
[04:04:30]  What's going on?  If everyone in that restaurant  Was as stoned  As some of the people  That come up with this stuff  You would love it  It would be great  It would be huge  Yeah because the other  I mean they're horrible shows  Have you seen Friend Zone  On MTV?  Nah I mean  I'm obsessed with that show  Because what they do  I think we only have  A couple minutes left  But I'll tell you real quick  What they do is  They take a guy or a girl  Who's had a crush  On their best friend  For years  I have seen this yes  And at first I thought  It was going to be horrible  Like because what you do  Is then they get you ready  For a blind date  And then at the end 
[04:05:00]  They find out the dates  For them  And reveal that it's  It's me  I've always liked you  Exactly  Now I thought that  Every show was just  Going to be a beautiful moment  And it was going to be  A horrible show  No  But then  Like the final moments  Of that show  Every time it's on  Are the greatest things  On television  Because it's just awkward  Like what?  Like I saw  You told me this was  For someone else  I saw  Yeah  I don't want to date  You were a friend  I saw an episode  That was just on  Like this week  Where the girl  She's had a crush  On this guy forever 
[04:05:30]  But the guy  When I'm watching it  Is obviously a gay black dude  Like he's like  The most effeminate  Black guy I've ever seen  She couldn't put that together  And like at the end  Of the date  He goes  Or the end of it  And she goes  The date's for you  He goes  I'm gay  You didn't realize this  Maybe she's like  I just really wanted  To be on TV  Gerard  Yeah  Yeah  Exactly  Just go with it  Yeah just roll with this  We have to let  Ron and Fez  Start their show  But I would encourage  You all to check out  Jeff Dye  Go to carolines.com  He's there all weekend  Headlining  And by the way 
[04:06:00]  Club Soda Kenny  Yes  Do you remember him?
