<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion of their "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" (WOW) promotion, encouraging listeners to display WOW stickers on their cars and celebrating the resulting (mostly female) breast flashing.  The hosts jokingly attributed the promotion's success to divine intervention, with Anthony mentioning a celebratory beer after a court appearance, prompting a discussion about beer as a celebratory beverage for life events.

The show then transitioned to a highly contentious interview with Nikki from "We Deliver Keggers." The interview rapidly devolved into vulgar and sexually charged banter, with crude jokes and comments about Nikki's appearance. Physical interactions between Nikki and the show's staff (Spaz, Rick, and Psycho Mark) escalated, leading to Nikki feeling harassed and threatened.  The discussion involved arguments about gender and sexism, punctuated by Nikki’s attempts to sell a TASCAM 38 recorder. Nikki ultimately left the studio visibly upset.  The hosts briefly announced upcoming guests Barry Williams and Kid Rock.

Next, Big Kev called in to promote a comedy tour (featuring Otto and George, Jeff Norris, and Chips Cooney) and tried to sell his used fish tank.  Listener calls followed, reporting successful WOW promotion results and comparing the show to Howard Stern’s.  The show continued with a lengthy, sexually suggestive interview with Barry Williams (Greg Brady).  The conversation covered Williams' new music (as Johnny Bravo), his *Brady Bunch* experiences (including explicit discussions about his co-stars and specific episodes), his dating life, and the unauthorized Fox *Brady Bunch* movie.  Commercial breaks featured advertisements for Earthlink and Priceline.com.  The segment maintained a consistently irreverent and sexually charged tone, replete with vulgar language and crude humor.

The Barry Williams interview continued, escalating in its sexually explicit content. Callers and the hosts asked increasingly graphic questions about Williams' time on *The Brady Bunch*, his relationships with co-stars (especially Marcia Brady), and specific scenes. This portion included a phone game, "What's in My Pants," where a female caller described genital sounds for the hosts and Williams to guess.  Advertisements for Stacker 2 fat burner and Car Cash aired during the segment.  A stripper, Anna Romeo, provided a lap dance for Williams, which was vividly described by the hosts.  The discussion then returned to *The Brady Bunch* and Williams' career.

The final segment focused on a listener, Gary, forced by his girlfriend to watch the final episode of "90210." The hosts and callers ridiculed Gary's situation, discussing the perceived “wussiness” of being coerced into watching disliked television shows.  Callers shared similar experiences with shows like "Ally McBeal," "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "Dawson's Creek," and "Charmed." Opie recounted a humorous anecdote about being caught watching pornography. More callers shared their stories, with one claiming to work with Gary and another offering Gary a proposition involving sports and sex.  The show concluded with the "What Did We Learn?" segment, featuring listener-submitted humorous takeaways, and promotions for the Vermont Teddy Bear Company and the Warped Tour (including a ticket giveaway).


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Booze. The world's universal language.  I use my breasts to get other people's attention.  Rumble out Wednesday!  Opie and Anthony. The brain is in their hands.  1-2-7-8-8-0-B.  Birthday!  Yeah, the first sound you hear.  It's worth Mount Wednesday, Opie.  Yes, it is, Anthony.  And God has endorsed Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[00:00:30]  The greatest radio promotion ever invented.  Oh, we didn't rip off Whip-Em-Out Wednesday from anyone, Anthony.  No.  The greatest radio promotion of all time, Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  One other radio thing you don't have to call in on.  You don't have to know anybody at the station.  You just put a wow on your car, and you're involved.  Wow.  Whip-Em-Out Wednesday. 
[00:01:00]  I'm seeing a lot of them out there.  Sorry, I'm enjoying the helmet.  Hand moot.  Yes, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  It was supposed to rain this afternoon, but look at it out there.  The Lord endorses Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  Finally, right, Anthony?  Yeah.  He's finally given in.  We've even worn down Jesus Christ.  He said, okay, I give.  I give, okay, you're going to do this.  Is Jesus Christ seeing a therapist because of our show? 
[00:01:30]  God loves boobs.  Have you gone to a therapist, Noby?  Without anything lately?  I don't need to go to a therapist.  How's the couch?  I am just very happy with life.  I'm very happy with my career.  Yeah.  While other radio stations complain about people doing their stuff,  we just continue moving on, doing great radio day after day after day after day.  See, now, I can't agree with you. 
[00:02:00]  What?  I've got to go the other way on this.  What?  What's the problem, Anthony?  I understand.  I understand the pain and hardship that certain people are going through.  Yeah.  And, you know, maybe we're just the straw that's breaking the camel's back,  but I understand.  When you have a significant other that is...  Let's just call her Wendy.  You pick a name out of nowhere.  Wendy. 
[00:02:30]  Wendy.  Let's say you have Wendy, right?  Yeah.  And you've tried to build a career, and Wendy wants half.  Right.  I understand how maybe you might take it out on other people or other radio shows or whatever it is.  You might sit there and lay on the couch when you're having your session with your shrink,  and other things might come out because the true thing, the thing that really is getting you, 
[00:03:00]  you can't really say or talk about.  that might be why other people in this city are upset with us.  You know?  You know, I understand.  I was in court today.  See, I got my court clothes on?  I see that, Anthony.  I got my court hair?  I don't think I've ever seen you this well-dressed before.  I look like a Gap ad.  Yeah.  Ha! 
[00:03:30]  Crazy!  Cool!  Crazy!  Cool!  You do have, like, Gap clothes on, and I didn't think I'd ever see the day where you...  Where am I going, like, Wallachs?  Where am I going to get a suit?  You're going to get a suit?  The only people that wear suits in courts are the ones that are going to be dragged away in cuffs.  Take off your hat.  I want to see your court hair.  Okay.  Here we go.  Ant's got court hair today.  Look at this, Rick.  Court hair.  Look at the court hair.  Look at the court hair.  It's all greased down. 
[00:04:00]  It's greased back.  I look like everybody that was in court today going to jail.  But, no.  Yeah.  Anyway, we're in a good mood.  But, yeah, I got my court clothes, my court hair.  And your court butt?  The easy-access pants, I see.  Yeah.  Court pants.  It's got the flap in the back, like those feetie pajamas.  So, you can take a dump.  Right. 
[00:04:30]  But this is so a big fist can fit right up your hiney.  Butt say.  That's right, Dominic.  Keep pounding.  What a treat today in court, Opie.  Had a lot of fun, huh?  You seem a little drunk, Anthony.  Go F yourself, Opie.  I might have stopped on the way for a bud on the way back.  I think we all could understand that, though.  I think, let's see, the court is at 60 Center Street. 
[00:05:00]  I was at 62 Center Street getting a beer.  Now, you know, you got it once you get it.  Yeah, I'm taking off tomorrow.  I'm too drunk.  Now, look.  What do you do?  It's like there's certain things that you do in life that when you're done, you have a beer.  Sure.  When you lose your job.  You have to have a beer.  You've got to have a beer.  Your chick dumps you, you have a beer. 
[00:05:30]  You're going to a court.  Yeah, you get out, you have a beer.  You get great ratings.  Well, that's a good thing.  You have a beer.  You have a beer, yeah.  Oh, you know, there's things you have a beer about that are good.  There's a fine line between good and bad when it comes to beer.  Knowing you're getting under other air personality skin.  Yeah, you have a beer.  You have a beer.  Right.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:00]  Oh, look at this.  Jesus Christ checking in, Anthony.  Jesus is listening.  And on the eighth day, God said, let there be breasts.  Yeah.  Let me tell you something.  If you guys don't see anything out on the highway, I don't know what else to tell you.  We're getting reports of wowings all over the place now.  Yeah.  It's getting out of hand.  Yeah.  Get your sticker on or get a wow on or something.  Yeah, get a wow on your car before you hit the highways today.  There's a ton of ladies that are more than willing to show their boobs if they see the  wow sticker on your car, okay? 
[00:06:30]  It is Whip Them Out Wednesday, for Christ's sake.  Mm-hmm.  And if you need a brand-new wow sticker, Anthony, we're doing a wow sticker stop today.  Where are we?  Well, we picked a place nice and close to the station to guarantee that Earl will be on time.  He'll still be late.  We're going to be at Ranch One, Anthony.  One of the big, huge sponsors of the Whip Them Out Wednesday sticker.  Yes.  He'll be there at 430, Earl.  We're going to be at the Ranch One on 8th Avenue and 50th Street, right there on the  corner, right?  Yep.  And try the coupon on the back of the sticker to go big. 
[00:07:00]  They've got a Ranch One coupon on the back of the wow stickers that we're giving out today  at 8th Avenue and 50th Street at 430 with Earl.  We're looking for a huge crowd to show up there today, okay?  Please, yes.  Whip Them Out Wednesday, the most original radio promotion ever invented.  Yes.  Ever, ever invented.  So huge, you'll be on the analyst couch after you put a wow on the back of your vehicle.  I would love to know where we ripped this one off, Rob. 
[00:07:30]  Hmm.  You ain't going to find it.  It's an O&A original, pal.  Came up with this one.  I get it.  Try to figure it out.  Try to figure it out.  It's not going to happen.  It's an O&A original.  We killed the mayor of Boston.  Don't have it with us.  It's the greatest, the greatest promotion ever, ever invented in radio.  Well, let's...  And our own.  Let's talk to a radio personality here in New York. 
[00:08:00]  Okay.  That loves wow, but is a little leery of Opie and Anthony.  Okay.  Hello?  What?  Sounds a little disturbed.  Goddamn, that's funny.  Anyway.  I'm in a court of law, and I should be listening to these things going on, Opie.  That's all right.  I missed the whole thing.  Hey, Anthony, Nicky from We Deliver Keggers is outside the studio. 
[00:08:30]  I know.  I was accosted on my way into the studio.  Yeah.  Most times you're greeted by guests.  I was accosted.  Well, we'll talk to her next, see what she's been up to.  We haven't had her on the show in a while.  All right.  I think Kid Rock is wondering where his hat went.  Does he have the Kid Rock hat on?  Well, I've got to give Nicky credit.  I think she had it before Kid Rock.  All right, Anthony.  Well, let's take our first break.  We're just getting started today.  Is it true that Greg Brady is going to be in our studio today? 
[00:09:00]  Stop it.  I didn't know.  Wait, come on.  Barry Williams, stopping by today.  Johnny Bravo?  Johnny Bravo in the flesh.  Oh, finally.  And I'm ready to rock.  Johnny's back.  I'm ready to rock.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll be talking to Johnny Bravo.  Let me go on record and say, did he bring a guitar?  Oh, that was...  Johnny did.  I would love to sing along with him with some of the favorite Brady tunes from the Brady  Six. 
[00:09:30]  Johnny's back.  You know, that would be great.  That'd be cool.  He can't sing with the artist.  You know what?  He can't sing with the artist.  The artist.  Yeah, you can't start singing with the artist, Anthony.  That's a blatant ripple.  Oh, God.  It's going to take so long to come up with things that other people haven't done in this  city.  Hmm.  How are we going to do it?  Hmm.  Huh.  Been here two years.  I don't even think...  Ripping everyone off.  I don't know.  Now we've got to come up with new stuff?  I don't think we're even allowed to crap anymore. 
[00:10:00]  We're going to have to figure out a new way to get rid of our fecal matter, I believe.  It's been done.  How else are we going to get rid of our fecal matter?  God.  Someone has done that before us, Anthony.  Whoever.  Maybe we could have like a bag that's just kind of hanging at our side.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We could crap out of our hip.  Colostomy bags for everyone.  Anyway, Anthony.  It is Whip-A-M-L Wednesday. 
[00:10:30]  The greatest radio promotion ever invented.  You know what this show is like?  You know what this show is like?  Remember throwing eggs at the old guy's house down the road?  Yeah.  And he'd get all mad?  Yeah.  But wasn't it so much fun?  Yeah.  Of course.  I'm not going any further than that.  I'm just saying.  We used to throw rocks at an old bat.  Really?  That used to rake her leaves, yeah.  And run away.  It was so much fun, like you said.  It was fun.  Until you start really thinking about the person, then you might feel a little bad. 
[00:11:00]  Well, you feel bad if they have to go to a therapist or something.  You know.  Then you feel like, oh, that's horrible.  Absolutely horrible.  Oh.  God damn.  Am I getting paybacks tenfold?  God damn.  Remember years ago, and it was all funny to make fun of, like, Dominic and stuff?  Well, we could get into that next.  Oh.  You want to get into that next a little bit?  Oh, my God.  Was it so much fun?  You got to sit back and think about what you could say and what you can't say about your  situation, Anthony.  I'll be asked to any goddamn thing I want. 
[00:11:30]  Well, within reason.  Ant, you need a sea breeze?  Yeah, please.  Give me a sea breeze.  I need it.  I understand.  I just want to say to somebody who's listening.  Dude, you're a Jack and Coke guy.  I am.  No.  Jack.  I never want to smell Jack Daniels again.  Captain Morgan and Coke?  You're not a sea breeze type of guy.  No, not sea breeze.  Sea breeze with a little...  Captain and Coke, man. 
[00:12:00]  A little umbrella and stuff.  Captain and Coke are just a bud.  All right.  Just give me a bottle of bud.  All right, Anthony.  Let's take a break, okay?  Hi.  Greg Brady in studio.  What time today?  4.30.  All right.  And we're going to mess with Nikki from We Deliver Keggers next.  We'll be right back. 
[00:12:30]  We'll be right back. 
[00:13:00]  We'll be right back. 
[00:13:30]  I've never heard of.  They speak English and what?  Uh, what?  English, mother f***er.  You speak it.  Yeah.  Then you know what I'm saying.  Uh, what?  Say what again.  Say what again.  I dare you.  I don't dare you, mother f***er.  Say what one more f***er damn time.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Okay. 
[00:14:00]  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Destroy.  Destroy.  What much?  O.P.N. Anthony.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  We deliver Keggers.  Yeah.  We deliver Keggers.  We deliver Keggers.  What's this happening sound?  We deliver Keggers.  We deliver Keggers.  I think it's the new one from, uh, Baruch Assault, right?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We deliver Keggers. 
[00:14:30]  We deliver Keggers.  Yeah.  I'm glad it's Baruch Assault, uh, playing at, uh, the Bowery Ballroom tonight, Anthony.  No, this is not Baruch Assault.  It's...  It's...  It's something that's not...  It's Nikki's song.  I'm bringing NYCB Don't Shoot Me Next.  It's really offensive.  Why?  It's to allow me, because it's sort of offensive against the city.  Nikki, did we introduce you yet?  Yes, we did.  Yeah, you just stepped onto the mic and started talking.  I haven't said hi to you or anything.  Just settle down over there.  You're supposed to wait until we say...  And, uh, in the studio now, it's, uh, Nikki. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, oh.  You know?  Oh, I have to get used to this.  Um, is that a new hat?  Yeah, Kid Rock called.  He wants his hat back.  No, well...  I wish you'd call me directly.  Yeah, that's a new hat.  I'd like to do a...  I mean, never mind.  See, I know that you wore a new hat.  I got a new hat.  I got a new hat.  Now, Nikki, it's, uh, it's Whippin'Bout Wednesday.  No, I know.  So, show your, uh, show your boobies.  She's got her own bell.  That's right, I got my bell.  And it's just like mine.  And I'm giving it to black girl, and I'm done. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, no, no, no.  Black girl can't have a bell.  You know, I just want to say...  Why are you...  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Before you start gender acting.  Is it the...  Is it the Opie, Anthony, and Nikki show?  Or is it the Opie, Anthony show with Nikki as a guest that's going to have her mic turned off if she doesn't show up?  What?  Thanks.  Put on your headphones.  Put on your headphones, because then you would have been able to hear that we turned your mic off.  You're going to put them on over the cowboy hat?  Oh, no, no, no.  All right, now, why the bell?  Let me see your hair.  No, I'm not taking my hair.  Let me see your hair. 
[00:16:00]  No.  It's your head.  It's not your shirt.  Oh, here.  No, take your head off.  Let me see.  And take your top off.  No, I'm not.  Nikki, we've never seen the top of your hat.  Wait, I just have to say something.  Oh, give us some head, Nikki.  Come on.  Last time, man, I...  I meant the top of your hat.  Last time I was here, I had no hat.  You didn't?  That's a lie.  Are you losing your hair?  No.  You didn't have a hat on?  It's my trademark.  Spaz, and he likes the whole cowboy hat.  Oh, Spaz.  Well, fashion guru.  Well, there you go.  I should talk Mr. Gap.  I know.  He was very dapper today.  Thank you, Nikki. 
[00:16:30]  Wait, so because of Spaz, you're wearing a hat?  No, I like the hats.  They're fun.  Last time I was here, I didn't wear a hat.  All right, it's Whippin' on Wednesday.  Can we see your boobs?  Oh, man.  Oh, Rick just took her hat off.  She's freaking out.  Say, wait a minute, Nikki.  No, that's nice.  You got a wild hair look going.  Her hair's all like half hair.  Let me see.  No.  No, that's good.  See, look.  That's good.  She's fatter, Nikki.  She's already running around.  All right, here you go.  Of course I'm running around.  There you go.  And you know what?  Rick shouldn't be touching people.  Rick, you shouldn't be touching people. 
[00:17:00]  Shut up is a bad word.  Hey, did you get that outfit from your aunt?  No.  Oh, you mean my sweater?  Yeah.  I have a sweater around.  Do you have an aunt in like Astoria?  I'm like, you know, here we go.  No, no.  I'm thinking you wear the sweater.  I'm wearing the sweater to cover myself.  Yeah, exactly.  It's beautiful weather out.  Yes, and I had it off when I was outside.  It looks like you just killed a lamb and put it over your shoulders.  No, actually, I'm not doing the sheep thing like everybody else.  No?  No.  All right, Nikki, Nikki, we will allow you to do whatever you want on our show as long as 
[00:17:30]  we get to see your boobs first.  We're never seeing Nikki's boobs.  Then why is she in here?  I don't know.  Well, because I had it.  Well, if you let me speak.  Okay.  First of all, I came to say hello.  Well, and I also came because I had...  All right, Nikki, what?  NYPD, Don't Shoot Me is totally different than that. 
[00:18:00]  What, a new song?  NYPD, Don't Shoot Me.  You're the latest hit?  Oh, yeah.  You know we support the NYPD.  It's very funny.  I know, and you may not play it because it is offensive.  And I know that you have, like, this whole...  Are you implying that the NYPD shoot people at random?  Oh, I don't know.  The song's not done yet.  Well, why are you coming in if the song isn't done yet?  Well, for some reason...  Do you have a copy?  No, I came for something else, actually.  Well, that's three things now.  Say hi.  www.raise.com 
[00:18:30]  You can't plug a website.  Raise Hellmiki.com  Wait a minute.  Your mic's not on.  Hold on.  Hold the phone.  Your mic's not on.  Before you give it out, I've got to check it out.  Yes, it is.  It is not...  It's just...  I just...  You stupid bitch.  Oh, that's messed up.  Raise Hellm...  How do you spell your name?  R-A-Y-Z.  Hellm.  N-I-K-K-I.  At Hotmail.  It's just...  N-I-Y?  K-K-I.  Yeah. 
[00:19:00]  At...  Oh, no, it's an email address.  Yes.  I thought you had a website.  Why are you plugging an email address?  Because I have this TASCAM 38 I want to sell.  She's selling stuff.  Nikki...  Wait, you know, we really try.  Like you guys...  Wait, you're coming in here to sell stuff?  Nikki, we try, we really try to have you come in here and have some fun with us.  And all of a sudden, she's selling stuff.  What is this?  The bylines?  No, you just...  We have a TASCAM recorder. 
[00:19:30]  It's from Nikki.  Yep, and if you want...  Me dialing.  Email me if you want it.  I know...  Oh, my God.  Like Psycho Marx ready to just storm in.  No, that's not the only reason I came.  But then you start using words like bitch because you hate women.  You hate women that don't comply.  You stupid bitch.  Butt sex.  Vaginas.  Vaginas.  We love women.  No, you don't.  We love women.  You only like to agree with women.  Lose the sweater, Nikki.  See?  You see?  Lose the sweater.  You got a big... 
[00:20:00]  She's got a tie around her shoulder.  She's got a big knot where the sleeves are right over her boobs.  Psycho Marx, get in here.  No, uh-oh.  Take off her clothes.  No, no, she can't.  It is!  It is!  It is!  Psycho Marx chasing her around.  She ducked behind the equipment again.  Oh, my God, please!  Oh, my God.  There's an assault going on behind the equipment. 
[00:20:30]  Come here, little snake.  You all right there, Nikki?  All right, Nikki.  Because you're gay, nothing you should take it out.  Wow.  All right.  Oh, okay.  I love how she runs away screaming.  Where is she?  All right, Nikki, you can come out.  It's safe.  No, no, I don't want to come out.  You don't like women.  Jesus, I love women.  Now, get over there.  You idiotic bastard.  You know what he did to me?  Off the ass.  Shut up!  Get over there!  You got to get on mic.  Get on mic.  Or else no one's going to hear you, Nikki.  I want to find out what I did to her off the air. 
[00:21:00]  We deliver lithium.  You know what Opie really thinks?  What?  Opie thinks that if a girl wears a certain outfit, that it means she wants to be sexually abused.  Oh, my God.  Sexually abused girl.  Psycho Marx, take her.  Take her now.  No, no, I swear to God, I'll sue.  Bye, Nikki.  Get off me, you freak.  So, Nikki, why do you dress up and wear like, Nikki, why do you dress up and wear pants like  that and stuff that accentuate your figure? 
[00:21:30]  Because Ben is gay.  Ben is gay.  Psycho Marx is gay.  Thanks!  All right, Nikki.  All right, get back on the mic.  Nikki, if you don't want to be seen as a woman, as a beautiful woman, why do you wear clothes  that accentuate your lovely behind and your midriff is showing under the little belly shirt?  You stupid bitch.  All right, let Nikki.  Why wouldn't you just wear, why don't you join the nunnery or something and become a nun? 
[00:22:00]  No, because if you wear an outfit that makes you feel feminine or sexy, it doesn't mean  that you want to be called bitch, whore, slut.  You don't want to be a classic.  No, but there's a fine line.  You don't want to be told to wear your clothes.  All right, but there's a fine line.  You could wear that, and then if we compliment you on how you look, you could take it as  a compliment.  You take it as a...  Nikki, get on the mic, because someone wants to buy your...  Rick was under the console when she sat down. 
[00:22:30]  All right, Nikki.  Look, look.  Rick is walking away.  Look, Nikki.  Rick, get over here.  We need you in front of the mic.  Look, Rick walked away.  Rick walked away.  Rick walked away.  Go that way.  Go this way.  You won't have to go near him.  Get back up, Mike.  There's someone, honestly, that wants to buy your camera or whatever it is.  Look, look.  Guys, guys, go against that wall, please.  I want to talk to Nikki.  Yes.

We don't mean anything.  All right.  See, they're out there.  They can't get you.  They're all locked out.  Okay?  You know.  Now Nikki, now what is your problem with guys?  I don't have a problem with guys.  Okay.  When we got off the air last time I was here, Opie said, if you don't like the way we treat  you, why do you dress the way? 
[00:24:30]  I know.  The door's locked.  You can't get out.  God damn, Nikki, you're a pisser.  Ben didn't do a thing. 
[00:25:00]  Psycho Mark's the pervert.  All right.  God, that was great.  Mark, that was perfect.  It smells good between your legs.  He put his head right in her lap as she was talking.  She didn't even see him coming around.  You're a pisser, man.  He's wearing a star t-shirt.  I guess he's going to be stripping it.  Okay.  Nikki, the sweater doesn't quite cover your ass, and we're looking at it as you walk by.  That's what I mean.  All right, now sit down.  But you're dressed in a way where we're kind of looking at you.  You can't accept yourself as being a girl that, like, guys might want to look at? 
[00:25:30]  Isn't that horrible that you can't even accept that?  Anthony, David wants to buy.  What are you trying to sell?  Oh, Tascam 38.  Oh, Tascam.  Oh, we got a buyer?  Yeah, why don't you put your headphones on, and we'll talk to David.  No one's under the console.  No one's under the console.  Take a look under the console.  No one's there.  Off the air.  But on the air, he's sitting.  He's pulling his pants down.  He's pulling his pants.  Oh, my God.  David, what's up?  I want to buy her camera, but she'll tell me something. 
[00:26:00]  She can get her to sit down and tell me about it.  All right, Nikki, sit down.  All right, Psycho Mark.  Let her sit and talk about her Tascam.  I'm playing with his zipper.  All right, can I sit down?  It's a big track recording device, sir.  Sit down.  So don't call it a camera.  Okay.  All right, Nikki, sit down.  Sit down.  I'm grabbing a Tascam.  Sit down.  Dude on the phone.  Yeah, I got it.  Yeah, okay.  All right.  Ben, can you not go in the phone?  Give her hell.  Nikki.  Okay.  Nikki, we're wasting valuable radio time. 
[00:26:30]  Now, get over there.  There's a guy here.  You came here to sell your Tascam.  Oh, my goodness.  She's locking the door herself.  She's locking the door.  There it is.  Very good.  You're totally safe.  You're totally safe from our wackos.  Okay.  We deliver Prozac.  We deliver Prozac.  Everybody knows that when you get attacked, it puts you in a very odd situation.  All right.  An odd position, doggy style.  All right, David.  David, what do you have for Nikki?  She's selling this 8-track recorder. 
[00:27:00]  Well, tell me something about it.  Like, is it a really good one?  Has it been used much?  This guy doesn't know.  What do you do with a Tascam 38?  Do you know?  You record stuff.  How many tracks are on a Tascam?  Eight.  Okay.  We all know.  Hey, look at it.  Who gave that answer?  It's a base.  Everyone knows.  Everyone knows.  Nikki, I've got cold hard cash.  What is it, the Millionaire Show?  No, no.  Come on, tell me about it.  Like, how old is it and stuff?  Oh, it's got 500 hours.  It's about a year and a half old, and it usually goes for, I don't know, two grand, something  like that.  Oh, yeah?  I'm selling it for 900. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, not good.  And you really need the money, right?  Well, I'm going computer-based.  I don't, like, really, I'm going logic.  Because you might be able to cut a deal.  Like, if you let me tie you down and eat your pineapple, then I'll buy you.  You wouldn't know what a Tascam 38 was if it fell on your head and knocked you out senseless.  But I know it's a pineapple.  All right.  That's who you, he called me to collect.  I said I got my bill.  That's because you were sleeping with him.  I was sleeping with your daddy if he looked like you.  That's my kid. 
[00:28:00]  Did he get a nice pineapple?  Or, you know.  All right.  We have another guy that wants to bid for the, uh, for the 8-track recorder.  Anthony, what's up?  Yo, boys, what's going on?  He's not looking for a Tascam.  Nicky.  Yeah, I can tell.  He's just a goofer.  No.  Nicky.  Not at all.  No, no, no, thanks.  Don't call our listeners goofers.  They're serious.  Oh, yes.  All right.  Go ahead, Anthony.  That was so serious, too.  All you got to do is show them your stuff.  That's it.  I'll buy it. 
[00:28:30]  That's all right.  I could sell it through Manny's if I have to.  I doubt that.  Oh, well, you don't really know.  So, bye.  You use your tongue prettier than a $20 whore.  Oh, my God.  That's awful.  That's outrageous.  Slim Pickens.  How dare you?  How dare you?  It's a recording.  All right.  Forget it.  Forget it.  You're too quick for us, Nicky.  I just wanted, I just, look.  I asked if I had told Anthony before I went on the air if I could say that, and he didn't 
[00:29:00]  seem to have a problem with it, although Rick did.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  At least he's picking up a bag and leaving.  They hate women.  Yeah, that's why we invented Whippermel Wednesday.  Nicky, I won't buy your test cam.  You can't be nice to any of them.  Nicky, my dear, can I buy your test cam.  What is it?  The raid room prom queen?  What, yeah, that's why we ain't about the raid room prom.  I'm going, Nicky.  Mike Tyson would like to buy your own looked at Thor's lock. 
[00:29:30]  Where you going, Nicky?  You really want me to play?  Nicky, don't turn around.  You're not going anywhere, you fool.  I'm very serious.  She's going to sue.  I will sue.  Jack-a-mark, let her go.  But first, push her over here so I can punch her in the uterus.  I'm going to get away from that.  What?  We deliver blows to the robot.  We deliver blows to the robot.  She's screaming.  She screamed.  No, she has her own bell. 
[00:30:00]  All right, another.  She goes, you guys are a bunch of gay a-holes to Rick as he walks down the hall.  And groping chicks.  Another great appearance by Nicky.  Nicky, we love the girl.  She's amazing.  From We Deliver Canals.  She's out in the hallway just like screaming.  I swear, no.  All right, she's crazy.  Get a cell phone on her.  What?  Oh, now she's coming back because she really needs to sell this 8-track recorder.  Nicky, please, Nicky.  Nicky, some of our staff get out of hand sometimes, Nicky. 
[00:30:30]  Whoa.  Sometimes our staff gets a little out of hand, Nicky.  You've got to understand.  We're a bunch of guys.  No, he can't touch me.  We're a bunch of guys.  He can't touch my ass.  Oh, look at that.  Wait a minute.  You haven't tried to not.  Yeah, you have a nice set there with that guy.  Nicky, why are you so ashamed of your body?  I am not.  Why are you ashamed of your body?  I'm ashamed of the way you behave.  I am not ashamed of that.  Really, man.  If he, if he, what is the matter with him?  All right, listen, Nicky.  What is the matter with Psycho Mark?  You know, outside of the air.  Oh, gee, he's not called a mentally stable Mark. 
[00:31:00]  His name is Psycho Mark.  It should be right there in the name.  I'm here to say that their psychosis is all real.  This is not an act.  It's like biting into peanut brittle and saying, why isn't it a marshmallow?  It's called peanut brittle.  It's Psycho Mark.  We have another guy that's willing to, uh, make it a time to talk business.  All right, Mike.  Here we go.  Mike?  No.  Yeah.  Hi.  Yeah, Mike.  Yeah, listen.  Hey, ask her if that thing has an oral punch in, punch out.  Does it have an oral punch in, punch out?  Um, it does, but it looks like Ricky Martin. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, she's telling a joke now.  Oh, yeah.  It looks like Ricky Martin.  It looks like Ricky Martin.  Stick to sell your equipment.  What?  It's a, you don't even know what a TASCAM 38 is.  Oh, please.  I have a FOSTEX right now, and I don't like it.  You know?  I say FOSTEX.  She's been buying it, but, uh...  Well, email...  Look, if you're serious, email me.  Email me.  I'm asking, does it have a punch in, punch out with a foot switch, or no?  Yes, I have a foot switch.  Yes.  Does that come with it? 
[00:32:00]  Uh, well, for the cables and the foot switch, I might be able to throw the foot switch in,  but the cables would be an extra hundred, because the cables really cost us about almost  $300.  Really?  Well, yeah.  Well, what do you think, Mike?  I'm not buying it.  All right, fine.  Uh, I don't, I don't, because I, 900 bucks, I'd give you 700 cash right now for it.  I'll come down and pick it up right now.  I don't have it with me in the studio.  It's not me.  I'll tell you from the studio.  I mean, I'm only 20 minutes outside the city.  I'll come get it right now.  But, I don't... 
[00:32:30]  700 cash.  I'd have to, I'd have to make an arrangement with you, if you're serious.  All right, can you, I'll give you my email address off the air.  All right, give me your email address.  If you're serious, I'll, I'll hook up with you, and if it's 700, I think we can work that out.  But, I have to, I just have to talk to, uh, two other members in the band.  700 should be okay, but I can't make that.  It doesn't matter, have it.  All right, I'll give you my email address.  It's Mike at ccoink.net.  All right, can I just, can you give me your email address off the air?  Yeah.  If you're serious.  Will you give him a Hummer? 
[00:33:00]  No, I won't.  Will you give him a Hummer?  I don't think my wife is doing that too much.  So, you can't tell her.  All right, Mike, hold on.  All right.  All right, we have another taker for the task cam.  It's Anthony and Josh, it's six years old.  Jim, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, uh, Nikki, are you going to Pro Tools, or what are you going to after this?  Um, Logic.  All right, um, if I buy the, uh, reel-to-reel, can I tie up a splice tape?  It's not a reel-to-reel. 
[00:33:30]  It's digital.  Yeah, Robbie, if I tie up a splice tape, it's analog.  Do you know what you're talking about?  Yeah, I know what I'm talking about.  I want to tie up a splice tape.  Hey, hey, hey.  Please be quiet for a second.  If you really wanted reel-to-reel, you would know that that's analog.  It's not digital and has absolutely nothing to do with the Tascam 38.  Nikki, would you like to speak into my microphone on my Tascam?  Only if I connect you in the weight room, you prom queen.  Here it is.  Now, in order to turn the mic on, you just squeeze the testicles.  I'm going to.  And speak into it. 
[00:34:00]  What is she doing?  Hey, you're touching Anthony.  Don't even get me of me.  Don't touch Anthony.  Look at this alcohol on his breath.  Don't even get me of me.  Don't touch Anthony.  Nikki, I swear I will punch you in the vulva.  All right, listen, you touched Anthony.  Psycho Mark's allowed to touch you.  Mike Tyson at your cervix.  Go ahead.  Nikki, Psycho Mark's allowed to touch you because you touched Anthony.  Yeah.  No, I'm going to.  She loves Psycho Mark.  All right, get around here.  I detect some sexual tension.  Get her out of here.  We're bored with her. 
[00:34:30]  All right, Nikki.  Thank you for your appearance on the program today.  It was a great one.  We'll forward any emails referring to your Tascam to Nikki's email address.  I'm not showing my ass.  www.raise.com.  R-A-Y-Z-E-L-N-I-K-K-I at hotmail.com.  All right, guys.  You know what to do.  Oh, I know.  He's doing that.  No, no.  You're going to get some very nice emails from all of us.  You'll only get legitimate inquiries. 
[00:35:00]  Give it up one more time.  What's your email address?  No, that's right.  Only not your email.  Ray's Hell Nikki, right?  At hotmail.com.  And how do you spell raise?  R-A-Y-Z-E.  No.  R-A-Y-Z-E.  What?  What is it?  What is it?  I said it.  Get out of here.  See what?  See?  You hate women.  Because the only way...  I don't hate women, but you're boring now.  You can go along with what you want.  No, we got some good stuff out of here.  But I mean, unless I do exactly what you want. 
[00:35:30]  All right.  Bye, Nikki.  There she goes.  There she goes.  Nikki.  We deliver keggers.  Nikki.  Bye.  What's your email address?  W-W-W.  W.  There's no...  W-W-W is an email.  Yeah, it's email.  R-A-Y-Z-E.  Oh, my God.  Name is hell.  R-A-Y-Z.  R-A-Y-Z.  Some guy has become a homo just from listening to you.  R-A-Y-Z.  Hell.  Nikki. 
[00:36:00]  Steve.  Hello.  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  Yes, I've been married for 11 years.  I have two beautiful daughters.  And after listening to this woman, I just want to tell, sweetheart, children, I am a homosexual.  This woman has made me gay.  I have no reason to rhyme or reason to ever look at another woman.  I am 100% spagola.  Nikki.  This woman made me a homo.  Can we play What's in Your Pants?  Well, I'm sorry for your wife.  This woman made me a homo.  I apologize to your wife. 
[00:36:30]  Can we play What's in Nikki's Pants?  I do.  You are a disgusting bitch.  Please.  No.  All we got to do is we get a phone.  You're a blob.  Do you know how the game works?  You're a blob.  You're a dope.  Thank you, sir.  Oh, thank you.  That means a lot.  Nikki, do you know how the game works?  We take a phone.  I know how the game works.  Okay, you explain it.  Go ahead.  People have to go in there and take a phone and rub it on themselves without their pants  or underpants on.  Okay.  And I'm not playing.  And we guessed what you have in your pants.  Why?  Why is it that you don't give me for respect for Sandy?  Would you throw us one friggin' bone? 
[00:37:00]  Just do it.  Throw us one friggin' bone here.  Does Sandy love it when the women come in here and do that?  Sure, she loves it.  She loves it?  Yes, she does.  Why?  I bring half of them home for her.  You do?  Really?  Can I...  Seriously?  Can I have that verified?  No, you don't.  See, because it's BS.  Nikki.  Just go in the other room.  It's not me.  It's not me.  Then Nikki...  Why can't I be an individual?  Then Nikki, get out.  Because you won't do what we want.  You want to know the truth?  Because you're boring.  Okay, then I'll leave.  I thought it was funny, but all right.  Look, what are you...  I mean, what are you packing? 
[00:37:30]  You think you're in here for your musical talents?  I mean, come on.  What do you got in there?  No, I know what happens.  All right.  Well, you know.  Full rack full of afro hair?  We're just trying to get the best out of what is given to us, okay?  All right?  Congo Rainforest?  Are you in here...  What are you sporting?  I'm not discussing it.  Are you in here to, you know, perform for us with an acoustic guitar?  Why not?  I said I would bring NYPD Don't Shoot Me.  If you wanted the band to come for the road show, I would do it.  But, I mean, just because I...  I know why I got in here. 
[00:38:00]  I know if I was a guy, I wouldn't get in here.  We have guys come in here.  That's not true.  There are plenty of guys.  Look at them all around.  What do you see?  I work for you.  No, there are plenty of guys in here.  Whatever.  But you probably wouldn't let me in if I had just come with a song.  Nikki, what are you packing in your panties?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What do you got?  The thing is...  Triangle, wood floor, Hitler mustache, mohawk.  What do you got?  What are you sporting?  Just because I don't want to do what you want.  Nikki, what's your thatch?  Whatever.  What do you got?  Whatever.  I mean, Opie, Opie...  All right.  I know how he is. 
[00:38:30]  I figured him out already.  All right.  You got to be figured out.  Of course.  Of course.  What are you sporting down there?  He's really into...  I'm sure that when you go home, you talk really nice about the girls that comply to your wishes.  I'm sure you talk about them like princesses.  Sure.  Gets her turn on, and we have great sex at home.  Now, what are you sporting?  Well, I'm not doing it, but that's not me.  I'll mention your name tonight when I'm banging my girlfriend, okay?  Well, good for Sandy.  Okay.  Bye, Nikki.  She must say that.  Okay.  Yeah, she does.  See?  He's now fine.  Oh, my God.  She's all pissed off.  I'm not pissed.  I'm not as pissed as Opie is. 
[00:39:00]  I'm not pissed?  Oh, right.  Look at you.  I'm not as pissed off as Opie is.  Wow, Nikki, those are tight.  Wait a minute.  I'm seeing a little something.  Camel towel.  Did you see that?  Definitely.  It looks like she's sporting a yo-yo in the front of her pants.  I'm gone.  Okay, bye.  Okay, Nikki.  See you later.  Look at that.  My camel towel.  She's pointing at me going, you're pissed. 
[00:39:30]  You're pissed.  Second of all, did you get some camel towel footage?  Yes.  Oh, we got to put that on the website.  First of all, first of all, I did come in here with a song, and I did come in here on  that premise.  Second of all, you guys are total hypocrites.  Why?  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  And July, because you said about the roadshow, Rick said about the roadshow.  Did you say July?  And also, the way you genderize music, the way you genderize music.  Genderize music?  Yes.  I usually listen to it.  No, you talk about Stone Temple Pilots like they're totally cool.  They are cool.  And they're macho. 
[00:40:00]  And I like them, too.  And I went to their concert.  There's a comparison between Stone Temple Pilots and a stupid song called We Deliver Keggers.  We had fun with your cool little song, but the fact is, the song sucks.  Wow.  Well, Opie, we all know that you have the power to either go with it or not go with it.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, you do.  I'm just telling you the truth.  Because after you were positive about it, I had a lot of good feedback, and you know that.  We were positive about this.  We deliver Keggers. 
[00:40:30]  We deliver Keggers.  So let me bring in a high-techie.  We deliver Keggers.  So there's a lot of other different stuff, but you don't like female comics.  You don't like female singers.  No, we don't like female comics.  You diss No Doubt.  You diss everybody.  We don't.  I diss No Doubt.  Hey, I went to the No Doubt show.  Dye your hair pink.  Let me tell you something.  Come on.  I like female singers.  I just don't like your singers.  Stone Temple Pilots are great, but most of their audience...  Okay, Nikki.  Very good.  Very good.  On stage at the Beacon.  I was there.  I went...  Most of the audience... 
[00:41:00]  She's loonyer than Fiona Apple.  Well, then, why did a man get on stage at the Beacon and French kiss the lead singer  and dry hump him?  I was there.  I saw it.  And the problem with that?  You're a homophobe or something?  Nikki, go away.  Oh, big deal.  All right.  Go away.  Because you're mad.  I'm not mad, but you are.  You're mad.  No, I'm not.  I said your song sucked and you can't handle it.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Wow.  Okay, Nikki.  I can handle it.  Believe me.  Okay, good.  Because I know who I am.  I know what I've done.  Nikki, what'd you have for lunch? 
[00:41:30]  I'm not...  I've got to ask.  Well, what?  It's food.  Why?  Because Opie's pissed, so now he's going to try to...  Ed.  Yeah.  Ed has known me for a long time.  Do I look pissed, Anthony?  Opie is absolutely not pissed.  I could care less.  He's at the I could care less space.  You're just some broad with a bad song.  Why am I going to be pissed at that?  Steve from Foundry wants to talk to you.  Steve.  Now, Steve is a guy that runs the website.  He's put pictures, sounds, songs of you up on the site.  He's got a lot of publicity.  Steve.  Yeah.  Hi, fellas.  Hey, man.  Hey, Nikki. 
[00:42:00]  I've been on the record, executives.  I don't care.  Shut up.  Shut up.  He's pissed.  You're making yourself look even dumber.  Now, let Steve talk to you.  Steve, go ahead.  What do you have for now?  Steve, please.  Nikki, Nikki, are you listening?  Yeah, I'm listening.  Look, I listen to a lot of music from a lot of people that send me demo tapes.  Your song blows.  All right?  Well, you're going to back with me and Anthony no matter what.  No, he's had a website devoted to music before, long before.  This guy is everyone with us.  This guy knows more about music than. 
[00:42:30]  That was a song that was done to be funny.  It was supposed to be funny.  Oh, now you're saying it was done to be funny.  I said it about the first time I came on.  We deliver migraine.  The first time I came on, I said it was supposed to be a funny song.  Nikki, are you wearing a thong?  That's the only song I've ever done.  Are you wearing a thong?  No.  Really?  Because I don't see any panty lines.  The first time I said it's one song that I did to be funny  because I thought it was appropriate for the show.  You can say whatever you want, but that's a fact.  Look at her crotch.  Nikki, what?  You wish I was crying.  You know what I'm doing?  I'm leaving.  All right. 
[00:43:00]  Bye, Nikki.  Nikki, I don't see any panty lines.  You're wearing a thong, aren't you?  Look what we did to you again.  Again.  Rick, coach?  Did I get her?  No, we don't want her on anymore.  Why did she get coming in there?  I don't know.  It's amazing, isn't it?  She subjects herself to the same ridicule every single time.  Even a dog knows.  When a dog walks in, like, the same yard and gets, like, pounded,  it never comes back?  You beat the crap out of a dog enough, they will figure it out eventually.  Steve, it was really funny when Psycho Mark was hiding under the castle. 
[00:43:30]  Oh, my God.  You should have seen her face.  She freaked out.  That's got to be priceless.  It was fun.  Oh, she's an idiot.  All right, Steve, from www.foundrymusic.com.  Steve?  Yeah, yeah.  If you could.  Sure.  Just to help Nikki out.  She had a little bit of a problem here on the show today.  She's trying to sell a Tascam recorder.  Yeah, what, she got, like, an 8-track recorder she's trying to hawk?  If you could just put a link on the website to her email address.  Actually, I was just in the process of doing that. 
[00:44:00]  I was going to let her know that.  It's Ray's Hell Nikki.  That's spelled R-A-Y-Z-E.  Are you sure it's with an E?  Is it with an E?  I don't know now.  I think because she said I was wrong.  I'll do both.  I think it might be R-A-Y-Z-H-E-L.  Okay, R-A-Y-Z-H-E-L-N-I-K-K-I at hotmail.com.  Oh, she will be getting an avalanche in about five minutes.  Ray's Hell Nikki.  If you could do that just to help her out, because I'm sure our listeners will be only serious inquiries. 
[00:44:30]  Please, guys, don't get out of hand.  We don't like it when you send emails that aren't, you know, as per what the people want.  I consider myself a Samaritan of sorts.  Thank you, Steve.  And I would certainly be happy to do that.  All right, there you go.  Okay, guys.  From foundrymusic.com, F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  Did you see the Camelton?  She wears the tight pants, and she wears a shirt that doesn't cover her belly and something that's a little tight around the top, 
[00:45:00]  but she covers it up with a sweater that she's tied around her neck, and she vanshes people for looking at her.  Yeah.  It's amazing.  My mom wore that same outfit in 1961.  All right, Anthony, a WOW sticker stopped happening today at 4.30, believe it or not, with Earl.  We're going to be at the Ranch 1 on 8th Avenue and 50th Street, right there on the corner, pretty much. 
[00:45:30]  Just look for the van and the crowd and get your WOW stickers, okay?  Rock.  Yeah, it's Whip-Em-Out Wednesday.  It's a gorgeous day.  I mean, people are calling like crazy.  They're getting WOWed left and right, but it was tough to get to you guys because of what was going on here in the studio, all right?  All right, we've got to take a break.  We'll be back.

I've been out here for about a month now.  Right on. What's going down?  Nothing. I saw you guys had a wow sign on MTV on TRL.  Today?  Yeah, about 20 minutes ago I saw it as soon as they opened up.  Was it a big wow sign?  Yeah, it was a huge wow sign. It looks like they just cut it off a box and put wow on it.  Cool.  By the way, I've got to send you guys a pick. I've got a big wow sign on the back of the plane that I fly. 
[00:48:30]  I'm a student pilot out here.  Oh, right on.  Yeah, so I'm going to send it to you so you guys send it, okay?  You've been gone a couple months, huh?  I've been gone since March 26th, yeah.  Wow. Well, thanks for calling. How's Florida treating you?  Pretty good so far. It's a lot of work out here.  Yeah.  Anyway, you guys take care, alright?  Alright, man. Thanks.  There goes Xavier.  Uh, Mary, what's going on?  Hey.  Hi, Mary, what's up?  Hi.  Nothing.  Alright.  I just wanted to let you know that I saw the wow sign too. It's like bright neon green or whatever. 
[00:49:00]  Oh, nice.  It's like a huge sign. You can see it. You could spot it anywhere because it's so bright.  Wow, everyone's calling in with that now. Cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's really awesome.  Well, thank you, Mary.  Well, I just wanted to let you guys know that now that I saw that sign, now I'm going to wow somebody.  Oh, please do.  Whoa.  First car you see on the way home tonight with the wow, please wow them, okay?  I will.  Alright.  I'll do it just for you guys, alright?  Thank you, Mary.  Alrighty. Bye.  To flash their boobies if you have the wow in your car, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  The most original radio promotion ever invented.  Yeah, we didn't get that from anyone, I guess.  I don't think so.  Everything else is a blatant rip-off.  Yeah, our whole show is a rip-off except for wow.  Oh.  And what's in my pants?  I don't think anyone has ever done that one before.  No?  Nah.  No.  No way.  No.  No way.  Uh, Rick, what's going on?  You look like your head's going to explode.  Shoot me.  Why?  I think you just had to deal with Nikki. 
[00:50:00]  If you make me deal with that chick one more time, just shoot me and then wheel my body  out of me.  You were the one.  Let me say something.  Before the show, Rick comes running into the office all excited.  He goes,  I wasn't excited.  Yes, you were.  You're like, Nikki's here.  I think we could have some fun with her.  You're all happy and stuff, running up and down the hallways.  I was positive.  You couldn't wait for us to get her in here.  I was positive.  You know how it always ends with her crying on your shoulder?  Was she crying again?  No?  Yeah?  No.  I was, I'm exasperated.  Yeah. 
[00:50:30]  I swear I thought she was going to try and just jump, jump into the elevator shaft.  I, I, you know what fascinates me about her?  I don't know what she wants.  Right.  She comes in and there's no set thing that she wants from this program.  Like she comes in, yes, she's trying to sell something or something, but I don't,  I have no clue what she wants.  But she's yelling at me again saying, Opie doesn't know music.  I've been on scholarships.  I had to listen to that whole thing again.  Who cares?  She might be a very talented lady.  The fact is the, the We Deliver Kegger song is, is very, very eighties.  I think she needs a hot knob. 
[00:51:00]  It seems to me like she, it's been a while.  I mean, you know, the song doesn't even go anywhere.  She's really got a problem with you, dude.  I know.  And, and.  He hates me.  Why does he just say he hates me?  You know.  Because he knows he hates me.  And for the, this is what I've got to listen to.  For the rest.  She wants to sue psycho Mark.  I'm like talking her down.  Sue psycho Mark.  She's like, no, that's manhandling.  And I could take him.  Manhandling.  Manhandling.  I'm like.  She manhandled Anthony.  Yes.  She was all over Anthony.  I was hiding.  Uh, by the way, you were right. 
[00:51:30]  She does have a.  All right.  T-back.  Yeah.  It's obvious.  You know, she wears these thong and tight pants.  But the second you mention it, she freaks out.  Uh, Big Kev.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up?  You've been waiting for 55 minutes.  This should be good.  Wow.  Actually, uh, two things.  One, I wanted to say what a.  Absolutely.  I gotta agree with, uh, Opie that Otto and George, the finest stand-up performance on the  road right now.  Yeah. 
[00:52:00]  They were tremendous last night.  How, how was the crowd?  Nice?  Great.  Great crowd.  Big crowd.  Oh, good.  Big fans.  Uh, Jeff Norris, also very funny.  Uh-huh.  The gorilla boy.  And, uh, Chips Cooney, they're also.  Listen, one other thing.  Um, I have this old fish tank.  It's an Aqua Hut model 63.  Yeah.  And, uh, I was wondering maybe if, you know, you guys could say something about it.  Maybe I could, I could sell it.  Well, uh, Kev, does it come with gravel and a pump?  Yeah, it's a, it comes with all the wires. 
[00:52:30]  I, I spend extra on all that stuff.  And.  Will you charge a hundred extra for the heater?  No, no.  I'll, I'll, I'll throw that all in.  It's an Aqua Hut model 63.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  And, uh, it's a classic.  Thanks, man.  We'll, we'll, we'll sell that for you.  Oh.  Hey, Kev.  Yeah.  Do you work?  Do I work?  Yeah, I work.  Ha, ha, ha.  More for the show than I do at my job.  I understand that.  And we appreciate all the help you're doing.  Are you wearing tight pants and a thong? 
[00:53:00]  Uh, no.  No, but I, I could if the show required that.  All right.  I, I don't know what else to tell people.  I don't, George.  I mean, you'll, you'll laugh your yam bag off.  I believe they're coming around at the end of June again.  I'm not sure.  Cool.  I mean, I, I, I think he's hilarious on the radio, but I mean, to be in a comedy club  and see the visuals that go along with it, it's just amazing.  Oh, yeah.  And the two guys with him, too.  Jeff Norris, very funny.  I love Jeff.  And, uh, Chips Cooney.  Chips Cooney.  All right.  Very funny guy. 
[00:53:30]  Thank you, Big Kev.  Hey, take care, guys.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Chips Cooney with you here on Rock 93.  Uh, Gil checking in, Anthony.  Yeah.  I can't believe it.  It really works.  I just put the sticker on today and got wowed by two girls in a VW convertible.  One was hot and one was fat, but it goes to show you that it works on all women.  Yeah.  You guys are gods in my eyes.  It's a boob magnet.  Very cool.  It is Whippin' Mal Wednesday.  The boob sighting index is at a fine eight, Anthony.  Yeah, it is.  It's very nice out there.  We were predicting a seven yesterday, and it turned out to be an eight. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  Let's go to Matt.  Hi, Matt.  What's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hi.  I just want to let you know, Stern, he never mentioned any names, but it sounded pretty much  like he was talking about you guys this morning.  Oh, yeah.  You know?  That old gag.  Yeah, we heard.  I couldn't fall asleep this morning, so I put on him.  You've heard about that.  Help me out.  Nah, no big deal.  Nah.  I don't know what his deal is.  He thinks you guys are all imitating him and all that, but I don't know.  I think you guys are guilty of being men.  You know? 
[00:54:30]  Being men.  Yeah, I know.  That's what you're ripping off.  That's original, right?  Well, thanks, man.  I appreciate it.  Yeah, no problem.  All right.  Take it easy, guys.  Yeah, I've heard a lot about that.  It's just the same old gag.  What's going on?  I don't know.  I was too busy in litigation, Opie.  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  I was mad.  I was the same thing as the other guy.  I was listening to him this morning.  He was making me sick.  Eh, well.  And he specifically mentioned something from your show yesterday.  Oh, yeah?  What?  Yeah.  About the Kathy Lee Gifford bit.  What?  No one else could figure out that she sucks? 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  Is that what it is?  Yeah.  No one else can talk about the fact that she blows?  You know, and he was going on how he's God and how he created radio.  What Marconi did?  Like he's the only one that could be on radio.  It's that old gag.  What can I tell you?  I think it's obvious to everyone that we're doing very different shows.  We just had an article in the, where's the Friday morning quarterback?  There's a great quote in there.  You got past the picture enough to read it? 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  No, seriously.  What a mess.  Run and get it really fast, because we've got to take a break.  Jeremy's got it.  Uh, Pip, I mean.  Pip's got it in his office.  What was the word he was using, Jeremy?  Uh, tirade.  A tirade.  A tirade.  A tirade.  Do you know what a tirade is?  When you, uh, when you throw a tirade?  Or you go off on a tirade?  Eh, it's like a hissy fit.  It's a tirade.  It's a tirade.  A tirade, but he calls it a tirade.  He calls it a tirade.  He calls it a tirade.  I was born in England. 
[00:56:00]  What do you want?  It's really funny.  We just, we just discovered that our, our new PD, who we really like a lot, he's really  helping out the show and, uh, and fighting for us.  Unlike, uh, Ice Cream Boy.  Unlike, uh, Ice Cream Boy, the PD before us.  But anyway, um, we found out today that he was, uh, born in England.  His dad was from the States.  He was born in England, so he had one of those nasty, uh, English accents.  Hello.  He came back to the States.  He came over here, what, was he like 11?  Yeah.  He's in school.  Hello.  My name's Jeremy.  Yeah. 
[00:56:30]  How are you?  I come from England.  Why are you punching me?  Right.  And we learned today he was pretty much Pip of his school.  He was the English kid trying to get along.  And, uh, and he's, he's hidden his accent pretty well, but today one of the words popped  out.  He, instead of saying tirade, he said tirade.  A tirade.  A tirade.  Hello.  My name's Jeremy.  Pleased to meet you.  I'm from England.  Ah, stop that.  All right.  Well, well, thank you, Kenny. 
[00:57:00]  No problem.  All right, man.  All right.  Yeah.  Greetings and salutations.  It's Jeremy.  Thank you for welcoming me to these United States.  Ow!  Ow!  What?  Why are you touching me?  Just because I talk a little different?  Don't throw a tirade.  A tirade.  Ha ha ha. 
[00:57:30]  They were dying in the office.  Uh, what?  What?  And I wasn't even going to call him on it.  No, Pete turns around.  What?  What?  Uh, Chris, what's going on?  You almost threw up a tato at me.  Ha ha ha.  Hey, what's up, Chris?  Hey, I heard that old guy this morning.  Ah.  That old tired guy.  Whoa.  Don't say that.  You'll get us in trouble now.  Yeah.  Oh, come on.  You guys have totally different shows, but you know what?  You guys have a lot more energy.  That's all.  All right.  Not today.  Ha ha ha.  Had it beaten out of me.  Hey, uh. 
[00:58:00]  They got destroyed today in court.  Education underground, by the way.  All right.  Education.  Thank you, Chris.  No, I mean, let me, let me just read something.  This went to every radio station in America, uh, uh, Monday.  Uh, it's an article we did for the Friday Morning Quarterback.  It's a trade magazine.  It's a little radio industry magazine.  Yeah.  And Ant and I are completely naked on the front cover of this magazine this week.  And, uh, I don't know.  I think it's going to be in the paper very soon.  Let's just say that.  Uh, let's see.  And, you know, they always ask us. 
[00:58:30]  They, they, uh, the reporters have to ask us about, uh, a certain individual.  Oh, yeah.  That's a good question, you know.  Um.  When I'm in New York and doing radio.  Howard, Howard's rabid loyalists have accused you of ripping him off and, and have called  Opie and Anthony a copycat act.  How, how did you deal with that?  Our answer.  Oh.  Oh, no.  Is this going to be graded on a curve?  That's my answer.  It wasn't as strong as we thought it would be.  That's my answer.  We're getting pounded every day or anything.  We had a few, but aunt and I are used to that and we just moved forward. 
[00:59:00]  I think they liked this show as well.  The diehard radio listener really truly sees the difference between the two shows.  It's so easy to quickly go, oh, they're Howard Stern wannabes.  But if you really listen, we are definitely doing very different radio.  And then, uh, the interviewer goes, I heard Dee Schneider when he was on the show saying  people don't get pissed off when a band says that they're influenced by somebody.  But when a DJ or an air talent says they've been influenced by somebody,  everybody's up in arms about it. 
[00:59:30]  Uh, I answered this one.  I said, and I admitted on the air that Howard was definitely an influence in our careers,  but he wasn't the only influence, that's for sure.  I could think of a bunch of other guys that influenced me and they embrace,  and they embrace it, which is cool.  I worked for Brother Louise in Rochester and he's one, he's my mentor.  I talked to him in the past and told him what he's done for my career and he loves it.  That's all I have to say about that.  There you go.  That's it.  We're doing our thing, man.  Well, no matter what you say, uh, you can't win. 
[01:00:00]  Well, it doesn't matter.  You can't win.  Let's go to Nobu tonight, Ant.  Yeah.  Need a sea breeze.  All right, we're trying to catch up here.  We've got to take another break.  Uh, uh, Greg Brady coming in in about 20 minutes?  Yeah, about, uh...  Barry Williams?  Yes, Barry Williams, Opie.  I'm not sure he wants to be just known as Greg Brady.  He's multifaceted.  He's Johnny Bravo, also. 
[01:00:30]  Let's see the call.  Johnny is back.  We should either call him Johnny or Greg.  Well, it all depends because he's got a CD out as Johnny Bravo.  Yeah.  So are we going to get Johnny Bravo?  It's like having The Rock in here.  Is it The Rock or is it Dwayne?  Right.  You know?  Right.  He's going to be cool.  We met him briefly recently and he was very cool to us.  Yeah.  He likes the show, so.  Mm-hmm.  We'll see if he's willing to play along with us today, Anthony.  All right, real fast.  Earl should be at the WOW sticker stop in about 20 minutes. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, where is it?  Like, downstairs?  Yeah, good luck.  Uh, he's going to be at the Ranch 1 on 8th Avenue and 50th Street.  I got it from a Negro.  Within 20 minutes, Anthony.  I got it from a Negro.  With the brand new WOW stickers.  Because you get one of those, put it on your car, and you just might see something on the way home today, okay?  Yeah.  Let's not forget, wow.  The greatest radio promotion ever invented.  Yeah.  Simple as that.  We'll be back.  Stay there.

Psycho Mark heading down to Ranch 1, 8th Avenue and 50th Street with Earl to hand out the WOW stickers today.  They should be there in, ah, they're gonna be late again.  Who are we kidding?  Of course.  Always.  Uh, they're supposed to be there at 4-30.  Hoping for a nice big crowd there today, okay? 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  Alright.  Uh, George on Line 10, Anthony needs a little advice.  Yeah, guys, hold up.  Uh, a friend of mine's getting divorced.  Ouch.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Alright.  A friend of mine's getting divorced.  Uh, for no apparent reason, his wife is gonna leave him.  Yeah.  Kind of feel what, uh, Anthony's going through here.  I'm trying to console him.  10 years married.  I don't need to console him.  Yeah, 10 years married, and for some reason she says she just feels she doesn't love him  anymore. 
[01:04:30]  Interesting.  We're trying to figure it out.  What's going on?  Why is she leaving?  And we can't figure it out.  Uh, that doesn't sound anything like my situation.  Uh, she's about to get the divorce papers.  He thinks there's gonna be a nice, clean divorce.  Oh, yeah.  It always, it always works out that way.  I'm trying to be a cool friend here and trying to help him out.  I mean, he's like my brother, but, uh, I kind of want to tell him that I think there's  someone else in the picture.  Oh, there's no proof of it.  No.  They have, like, a storybook marriage.  Everybody loved them.  They were a good couple. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah, storybook.  Horror story.  Look at it.  Look at it.  Just, um...  Screw this guy.  Terry Williams.  Just tell him to turn the gas on.  Tell him to turn the gas on on the stove and just stick his head in.  Screw him.  Yeah.  George, we gotta go.  Barry Williams.  Barry Williams is right outside the door.  He's up to everything.  He's up to everything.  Come out in, Johnny Bravo.  Even all the girls.  Everything.  Look at you.  Look at you all smooth.  George, call back, right?  Were we keeping you waiting?  What, are you crazy?  I don't know how many stations I could be doing right now.  Hell no.  We don't keep you waiting. 
[01:05:30]  We're gonna keep you waiting in the outer office there.  Can we call you, Johnny?  Can we call you, Johnny?  Really, uh...  You're whisked right in.  Well, it should be.  Of course.  It should be, man.  Big star.  Come on.  I met all the news girls upstairs.  Yeah, you like that?  They all needed to touch me.  See?  They all wanted me to get some on them.  They all needed a little, a little photo.  And a little signature.  Did they?  Yes.  They need to know that they are totally groovy and to be endorsed by the only one who can  make them totally groovy.  Groovy.  That is me.  Where the hell did you get those glasses from, man? 
[01:06:00]  These are not...  Please, do not say sunglasses to me.  What are they?  Shades.  Shades.  Shades.  And if you, you know, if you had your own radio show, you'd know that.  If he was walking in with those, he could just go to his parents and go, Mike,  Carol?  Yeah.  I'm kind of over the nice guy, all American kind of thing.  Are you going to, like, go bad boy now?  I'm going bad.  I'm going bad.  You can do a couple of pornos.  That'll get you right in there.  Yeah.  What's this?  Some of the people that call in here, I think, are ready for a shot.  It's insane. 
[01:06:30]  I can't get past the shades, though.  I know you can.  Can we see our eyes or what?  No?  I'll give you a little glimpse.  You get those from one of those Nigerians downstairs?  I'll give you a little glimpse, but that's all.  You don't have to beg for more than that.  Okay.  There they are.  Man, that's him.  That's Greg Brady.  That's the man.  All right.  I love when you say that.  I love when you say that.  Call me Mr. Bunch.  It's more formal, and I don't know you that well.  Mr. Bunch.  How you doing, Barry?  I'm hanging.  That's good. 
[01:07:00]  It's good.  Do you know, I was in the studio a couple of months ago, and I was listening to you,  somebody about Midget World.  Yeah, we had a Midget.  Yeah.  I've been on the show.  Yeah.  And wasn't she a porno midget?  Yeah.  Porn star.  And I said, I have to do this show.  I was out there listening.  I go, I have to be a guest on this show.  We should have had the porno midget on when you were on.  Oh, I would have.  That would have been great.  That would have been fun.  Find her website.  Yeah.  A Brady moment.  How is she going to dress?  She's going to dress up like a Jean Benet, I think. 
[01:07:30]  Yeah, a little Jean Benet.  We're going to get a little cowboy outfit.  That was too good.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, calm down.  That's horrible.  I am going to take the shades off, because I think I've made an impression, right?  You have.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah.  I could see it.  All right.  Yeah.  All right.  Let it go.  Now we're rocking.  I could not get this effing song out of my head for like a day.  I was hearing it.  Johnny is back.  Johnny is back.  Johnny is back.  Johnny is back.  Johnny is back. 
[01:08:00]  Don't you know.  I'm ready to ride your town tonight.  Rocky Town.  Rocky Town is back.  You improved over the old Brady days?  Ready to dance till the morning night.  I can tell you that.  He's adding in line.  Ooh, ooh.  Join town.  Every moon.  Every moon.  It's snow.  It's a sunshine day.  It's a sunshine day.  Down straight, buddy.  Everybody's smiling.  Sunshine day.  No, no.  No, Barry, I've got to ask you something.  All right.  Ask away.  Who's supposed to buy this album?  Anybody who's in the spirit, is in the mood. 
[01:08:30]  Because if I bought this and I was tooling down Broadway, let's say, I think I would get  beat up.  Really?  I heard you like that.  Some people do that just to get beaten up.  Right.  Okay.  Hey, spin a little bit of Johnny Bravo and take your shot.  Yeah.  Take your best shot, man.  I don't know.  What do you think, Ed?  I think it kind of rocks.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like the Queen cover, actually.  Ready to rise to town tonight.  Here comes my favorite lyric.  Taking time on the corner of the bar.  Johnny's little breaking hearts. 
[01:09:00]  Oh, yeah.  Still breaking hearts there, Johnny.  You got that right.  You go, Johnny.  You go, Johnny.  You know, some people seem to miss, you know, there is a little bit of humor in this spectacular  song.  Of course there is.  You know, somebody gets a goddamn bummed out about music.  Hey, man.  You're not serious enough about your music, so please, you know, like, just get that CD  out of my face, okay?  I mean, what's that all about?  You were just Johnny Bravo because you fit the suit, okay?  It's like, lighten up, man. 
[01:09:30]  Have some fun.  Have a party.  Pour another piña colada.  You know, Barry, we smashed a lot of CDs on the show, and we haven't smashed yours.  We haven't smashed yours yet.  Oh!  Can I help?  Can I help?  How do you do it?  How do you do it?  Do you push a button, or do you really get, like, a small camera?  No, it's usually Opie just going crazy and smashed.  Kathy Lee's album got just nailed yesterday.  Oh, yeah.  I would definitely be around for that.  But for some reason, I mean, we've played Johnny Bravo, Johnny's back, a bunch of times  on the show.  We haven't smashed it.  I want to keep it.  There's something about it.  It's like a car wreck for some reason.  Speaking of Kathy Lee, who is one of my favorite personalities, I would just love to get 
[01:10:00]  a diversion of her singing the national anthem at another football game real soon.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  She's so talented.  On DVD.  Because you've got to get the eyes going on, you know, with a little bit of that helplessness,  and looking up into the sky, pondering the question from the Hall of America with the  flag.  And have Cody and Cassidy singing backup.  Yes.  That was always a good thing.  With choreography.  I mean, it's a little weird, you know.  And Frank in the background having anal sex with a hooker.  Whoa. 
[01:10:30]  Oh, that's right.  He did try for that, didn't he?  Didn't he?  It's been so long.  Well, guess what?  You know, the funniest part about that, too, is like, if you ever get turned down trying  to have anal sex with a girl, it's really bad, but it's just between you and whoever  it was.  This was out in the public eye.  I mean, everyone knew he was trying to get the anal and got turned down.  Well, you know what Frank doesn't know?  You're not supposed to go for the anal on the first.  First.  On the first loop over.  Yeah. 
[01:11:00]  How long before you went?  You're supposed to introduce these things.  You've got to work out for that.  Sure.  Right.  How long before anal with Marsha?  How long?  Come on.  Well, now, do digits count?  Or just, actually, she was an easy sell.  Poor Maureen.  She was an easy sell.  You know, like about two pictures of margaritas and you are mine.  There's been so much said about that.  She is the only girl I ever let call me Greg during sex.  And...  Oh, really?  That is sick. 
[01:11:30]  That was just a little, you know, a little, you know...  Who gives...  We were pretty bored as kids.  Quick before mom and dad come on the sand.  Yeah.  Who gives a better hummer?  Mom or Marsha?  Oh, no.  It's a good question.  You know what?  Is watching the show while you're making out with your...  Oh, my God!  I know.  It's a little incestuous, but...  That is really bad, but...  You know, when you're...  Something really hot about...  When you're a teen star, like, you've kind of done it all and been there and back.  Yeah.  You need things to heighten the emotion and heighten the effects.  So I used to just crack that old theme song up and go. 
[01:12:00]  Here's the story.  Of a lovely lady.  And bring up every lovely girl.  Or just the music like when the kids are walking down the stairs...  Oh, we've got to...  Oh!  We've got to play the Brady Bunch bits for...  Oh, we had a lot of fun at everyone's expense.  I can hardly wait.  At everyone's expense.  I know.  Well, we've got some really sick ones, though.  Wait, let me get you.  Do a little goofing on the show.  A little spoofing.  A little sarcastic. 
[01:12:30]  You're missing some of the wholesome qualities.  No, it's not.  We just figured because...  It's not like zoo radio around here, Barry.  Okay, good.  No.  Our bits are a little more intelligent than that.  No bells whistles.  They came up with a great concept.  Well, we figured because Robert Reed, who was your pop, right?  Yes, that would be right.  Yes.  I knew that, but go ahead.  Yes, I was just quizzing you.  He designed the house.  He was an architect.  Yes.  I just figured this out, by the way, because I've only been listening to you guys.  And the whole time I've been in here, I'm going, okay, now which is Opie?  Which is Andy? 
[01:13:00]  And I'm listening.  Andy.  We always get that.  Who looks like an Anthony and who looks like an Opie, you know?  Yeah.  But I've been listening and I finally figured it out.  Yes.  Anthony.  Right.  Anthony.  I got that right.  Let the stenographer record I am pointing at the right person.  The Italian.  It sounds like you've been in some litigation yourself.  Hey, don't talk jail to me.  I didn't do it.  I didn't do it.  I wasn't even there.  And it's not my car.  Really?  Well, I want to know the story about that one.  I don't know. 
[01:13:30]  Okay, so we were talking, I think we were going down there.  Robert Reed played your pop, of course, and designed the house.  And he designed that stairs.  The stairs.  Yes.  From the bedrooms.  Yes.  With no backs on them.  Yes.  And then the underneath part was enough room for someone to stand and look up under the  stairs at the girls' dresses as they came down.  Only Anthony would like that, you know?  You know something?  Yes.  He's got freeze frame on the television, and he has placed, transported himself underneath  the staircase.  From day one.  What I want to know is who is walking up the stairs when you, Anthony, are underneath 
[01:14:00]  looking up.  Oh, Marcia.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well, I can give you a play-by-play description of that.  That was always a baby.  You saw her develop and everything, didn't you?  I did.  I did.  And in one night.  Yeah, it seemed to happen overnight.  The whole flowering process.  All of a sudden, she went from the kid with the, like, wacky crying face, I hate you!  I hate you!  To the hot girl that the quarterbacks of the rival high schools wanted to date.  In one hiatus.  Yeah.  It all happened. 
[01:14:30]  She went from young girl to sweet young thing.  Yes.  And what happened?  You came back to film and you were like, yeah, Johnny's ready to run.  Johnny needs some of that.  Yeah.  There's a lot said about that.  You know, I wrote the book, Growing Up Brady, I was a teenage Greg, but one of the working  titles I had was, Growing Up Brady, Inside Marsh's Marsh.  Whoa!  Whoa!  We felt it was a little too edgy for her.  I think she had a...  I didn't understand.  Well, listen, we've got to take a quick break.  It wasn't the first time she got hit in the face and said, oh, my nose. 
[01:15:00]  What the hell's happening there?  We have to take a quick break, but...  That damn football spit at me.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  I like you, Mary.  You're all right, Mary.  We've got to take a quick break, Anthony.  Yes.  Um...  Well, as we look...  Kleenex!  Oh, yeah, go ahead.  I'll shut up.  No, you can continue.  Please don't.  It's going to be more interesting than whatever you're going to read.  I know that. 
[01:15:30]  No, we're going to play a song for you.  Okay, I'm ready.  Which one's this?  Oh, yeah, I was inspired by Marcia.  It's a quick ditty.  Is this one of your...  To pen this little ditty.  Yeah, this we used to do.  The guys in the band.  You know, you understand being the Brady...  I'm so down with that.  The Brady Six.  Oh, yeah.  Silver Platters, whatever you want to take.  Hang on, hang on.  It's been a long now.  Okay, go for it.  All right, two.  This is cool.  Tune it up, man.  All right, my guys.  Here we go.  Okay, we got a jump button. 
[01:16:00]  Looking at the screen.  What does the feeling mean?  I got this silverware down deep in my loin.  Say.  Who?  Who?  Beauty and who?  Ain't she a cutie?  The best in every club that she joins.  But, yeah.  Her little sister jelly.  Got it.  Sorry, he's doing the dance.  The Brady Six dance.  The Brady Six dance.  With a flower and princess.  Turning head wherever she goes. 
[01:16:30]  And all the things he does to me.  Yep.  Thank you.  Ay, ay, ay.  I'm a very first boner watching Marsha Brady.  It's true.  I'm a very first boner watching Marsha.  He's in shock.  I know.  He just missed this isn't on the new album.  Yeah.  It wasn't my first boner.  Yeah.  Phil Moe Junior High.  Phil Moe. 
[01:17:00]  Phil Moe Junior High.  Phil Moe.  F-F-F-I-L.  L-L-M-M-M-O.  O-O-R-E.  Phil Moe Junior High.  Phil Moe Junior High.  Phil Moe Junior High.  Phil Moe Junior High.  Phil Moe.  F-F-F-I-L  L-L-M-M-M-O  O-O-R-E  Fillmore Junior High  Hawaiian episode, great one  This is not bad  I could have used this for the soundtrack on my movie  I think I did

[01:18:00]  Right?  There he is, Boner  Yeah, see, how could you fit a Boner into a song, you know?  I feel we're bonding, we have something in common  It's catchy, right?

[01:25:00]  Okay  Completely understand  So the book signing's happening tomorrow  And you're signing the Johnny Bravo CD, right?  Yeah, the CD, the book  I'll be there at 10.30 in the morning  Tomorrow morning  NBC Experience, Rockefeller Plaza  And I'm staying until I run out of ink  Very good  Did you happen to catch on Fox last night  They did a little Brady Bunch movie  Oh  A little short movie  Fox did a little Brady Bunching  Yeah, yeah  A little skimming  Oh, you wanted a part of that one, Barry?  I think they called it the unauthorized  Yeah 
[01:25:30]  Do you know why they called it unauthorized?  Why?  Because it was  No one had any say in that  No, this is something that they extract  From what we call in the business  Public domain  Oh  Which means they go through a bunch of clips  From Entertainment Tonight  And Access Hollywood  And Star Magazine  And base the movie on that  And base the movie on that  Oh, by the way  Did I mention they borrowed liberally from my book?  Oh, really?  Oh, sure  Oh, sure  But just enough to keep the facts straight  Then they delivered it in a completely botched up way  But you know, it really would have sucked  If they didn't get such fine actors to portray it 
[01:26:00]  And look alike  You know, it's fascinating  I mean, I swear to God  I had to get on  I turned it on  And I said, I am seeing myself  It's like a mirror  There I am  In all my glory  A little fatter  A little taller  About ten years older  And smoking the wrong cigarettes  But there I am  Being very cool  Stuck up  And conceit  Well, they got that right  But the rest of the people  Well, everyone knows  You smoked a valiant cigarettes  I believe it was  No, no, man  That's a big V  No, a marble man  I'm talking on the show  When Greg got caught smoking 
[01:26:30]  The big V  I can't stand it  Valiant cigarettes  But it wasn't your jacket  It wasn't your jacket  It was your pal  That you were in the band with  And can I believe  My mom believed that  Yeah  What a line of crap  And that stuff shirt  Mother of your friends  That came over the house  Like, we're doing a meeting  About smoking in our high schools  The PTA lady  The PTA lady, right?  What a stuff shirt  And then your pal sells you out  I know  Hey, dude  You left these cigarettes  It's not my jacket  It's your jacket  Oh, Greg, thanks 
[01:27:00]  And then you ratted him out  No  Of course I didn't  You noticed he wasn't on  Our next episode  He wasn't  That's the good thing  About having your own series  Yeah  Yeah  It wasn't real  Stop  You just stop  I watched it  Like 80 times  I know it happened  It wasn't real, Anthony  It's a TV show  And they found out  Because he had ripped it  And Alice sewed up the jacket  So that's how he knew  All right  Speaking of Alice  Here's the litmus test  Yeah  Speaking of Alice  Now, we know she made  You know, the meatloaf 
[01:27:30]  And the hot Christmas turkey dinners  Yes  And we know that she actually  And I know this was a trick  Of double photography  But she was actually  Sergeant Emma  And now, same person  Yeah  Okay, we  Yeah  But she also  Our beloved housekeeper  Had a last name  Yeah  And I'm just searching for that  Hold it  Searching for that last name  Oh  God damn it  I can help  It's the short term memory  Think Ozzy  And I don't mean Osborne 
[01:28:00]  No  Not Osborne  No  No  No  No  Harriet  Harriet  Yeah, Nelson  It was  There was  Yeah  Okay, there'll be more  I'm only giving you half a point  Because I could see that it was  I'm trying to think of  In the upper part of your brain  Where that name came out  In one of the episodes  But I can't remember  Alright  My short term memory is shot  Well, now that you have  The next two nights of reading  Worked out for you  Yes  Yes  You'll be able to get that fact  And many more  Growing up reading 
[01:28:30]  I was a teenage Greg  Yes  You know, and we've  Thumbed through it  I actually read one of the books  Was that your book  Talking about how  How Robert Reed was upset  With a lot of the episodes  And storylines  Yes  Yeah  In fact, I had  I interviewed him over several days  And he supplied the actual memos  He said  The memos are great  I got this up in the attic  And in fact, he was dying at the time  I didn't know it  At that time  But he went up  And he got these memos  And maybe that was part of it  He wanted to, you know  To share  Yeah  Who he was  And what he was about  With this show 
[01:29:00]  Because I think he actually  Improved the show  But these  Some of these  Some of these memos  Were unbelievable  Like they would  Write these episodes  And Robert Reed  I think he wanted to be  Accepted as  As an actor  As a thespian  Well, no  Thespian  Lesbian  I don't want to even get into that  But he wanted to be accepted  As like  An actor  And  They would come up  With these ludicrous episodes  Sometimes  And he would be upset  With the storyline  Like, no  My character  Wouldn't react that way  And write these memos  To the producers  It's like 
[01:29:30]  It's the Brady Bunch  It's like  Fluff, fun  Kind of show  Sure  Doesn't have to be serious  He was coming  From a completely different place  He studied at the  Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts  He was classically trained  He was accepted  He was accepted as a  Thespian  Thespian  And did a lot of  Shakespearean plays  Or the tights  You know  The whole thing  And  Defenders  You know  Were nominated for  Emmy Awards  With E.G. Marshall  So he did have that  Whole thing going on  And of course  The other thing  He had going on 
[01:30:00]  Now did you know  That he was a gay man?  After our second date  Really?  Yeah  How many times  Has he said that?  I make  I make like  Good kisser  By the way  Greg  Greg  Right  Just not  Not after 5 o'clock  Without a second shave  No  I mean  At some point  You do  I mean  You know  Kind of what's going on  With your co-stars  Right  I mean  You know  Which  Let's say  Which time of the month  To stay away from  Marcia for instance 
[01:30:30]  Really?  All that stuff  Wow  And you know  What's going on  With Robert Reed  Because you're close  You know  When to make the move  On Florence Henderson  Because she's vulnerable  And feeling lonely  Now as per the Fox  Little TV movie  You got turned down  By Mrs. Brady  Yeah I mean  That's accurate  I mean  That's accurate  You went on a date  We went on just one date  Right  You know  And I was throwing  All my best Greg Brady moves on her  And I had my imagination going  A little extra bottle of Weston oil  In the backseat  In case  With protection  And  By the way  If you ever use Weston oil  Never heat it 
[01:31:00]  Beyond 82 and one half degrees  It burned the heck  Out of your back  And so I was doing  I had all my childhood fantasies  My teenage hormones  Were raging  And what have you  You must have gotten  So much young  Tail  That you finally decided  You wanted some older  Tail  I needed experience  I needed experience  I was tired of training  All these  You know  These wannabe  You know  Groupies  And I  You know  I just felt  That I was missing something  Now there's  There's Florence  You know  With hair  You're missing hair  Whoa  Oh god 
[01:31:30]  And you're right  And  Not the razor blade  And so  I was hoping I'd get  A little instruction  But you know  She was not  In that vein  She let me kiss her  She let me give her  She did huh  She let me kiss her  Like a passionate kiss  A little pack  Or something  No  I didn't get past her tonsils  Or anything  No  You know  A little like wet lips 
[01:32:00]  That'd be  God  That must have just looked  Oh it was good  But it must have just looked  It was fantastic  It must have looked  In my movie  It looks fantastic  It looks great  What is your movie  Is that the other one Sunday  Sunday night  On NBC 9 o'clock  Can you believe  I squeezed a movie  Out of this deal too  Wow  Talk about the milk wagon  Now this of course  I have to see  What can we expect  In the movie  Well listen  All the dark  Dirty secrets  I made this movie for you  Did you  I made this movie for you  That's for me  Because 
[01:32:30]  Because  I mean  Particularly  If you've like  Heard some of the rumors  Maybe even read the book  That kind of thing  The movie won't disappoint  But instead of just describing  Like little romps  In the swimming pool  Or in the bedroom  I mean you actually see  Like tops coming off  And intertwined  And the towels  And the music going on  And tongue going on  And passion  Yeah  You hear some of the Brady Bunch  With  The portal version  Of the theme song  We have cool tunes  Going on in the background

[02:09:00]  There's Greg  And he's got like  A thing on his lip  With a white thing over it  And it's like  They don't explain it  They don't refer to it  Something about cutting yourself  Shaving  It was retarded  And for years  I'm like  What the hell was that  Yeah  And you answered it  In your book  But I'm seeing a couple of people  Have that question  What was the swamp lip  I will tell you  I will tell you what that was  But first  What did you think  That it was  I couldn't  For the life of me  Figure it out  Most people think STD  Yeah  Yeah  It had to be  Some kind of herp 
[02:09:30]  Or something  Herpetic situation  A little volcano  There on the lower lip  For the Greg man  Right  The Greg man  The Gregster  This is not  I noticed Robert Reed  Had one  Same episode  Just on  Get away  Get out of here  Gee  No  This is not  Not caused from the sun  Or anything else  I was in a  Head on collision  A head on collision  In my car  Awesome  And  In your groovy Volkswagen  No man  No what did you have 
[02:10:00]  I had a 356 Porsche  Look at you  Oh man  I got a lot of money  I'm a teenager  What are you going to do  Run around a Volkswagen  Break  Kind of a babe magnet  Is that  Now it's okay  But yeah  I'm a Porsche  Porsche  And so anyway  Going down  This lady  I swear to God  She's a teenager  She is driving  A station wagon  With the wood  On the sides  Oh yeah  One of the Brady episodes  Talking to her dog  In the back seat  Which is always a good thing 
[02:10:30]  To do when you're driving  You are  And while she was  Turned around  She just happened to  Drift over into my side  Of the road  And this is residential now  So we're down  You know  About 25 miles an hour  30 miles an hour  And I'm coming to a  Screeching stop  But not in time  And the impact  Forced me against  The steering wheel  Where I tore my lower lip  From my lip down  Almost damn near  To my chin  Now when you see  Your life flash before you  Is it your life  Or Greg Brady  I'm wondering  Do you see the wedding  Of Mike and Carol  Tiger and Fluffy  Running through the cake 
[02:11:00]  Or is it your life  Good  I didn't have time  For any of that  The next thing I knew  I had my teeth  Embedded in the windshield  And fortunately  It didn't break my jaw  It didn't even  Knock out my teeth  But it tore my lip  Down  And they put  I think 12 stitches  But it was all  In one straight  Little line  Easily covered  With a tiny band-aid  So that's on Thursday  I show up Monday  For work  It was Thanksgiving  I show up on Monday  For work  And they go  Oh my god  Because now it's swollen  You know  I've got these stitches 
[02:11:30]  And it's like  Getting a little oozy  And stuff like that  They're going  Well  In typical form  Well  No problem  This is Bradyland  Let's put a band-aid on it  And you cut yourself  Shaving it  Let's get on with the show  He's shaving his mouth  Yeah  Like how are you  Shaving your lip  Yeah right  Exactly  Explain that  I wasn't buying that  So the idea was  You just downplay it  And no one would ever  Ever notice  And the worst part was  The whole episode  Was you doing  So you were using  Your mouth  On the little flute thing  Oh wow  And it hurts 
[02:12:00]  Another Robert Reed reference  You know  You do something like that  And you think  It's going away  Then it turns out  That they have shown  Every episode  A hundred thousand times  A hundred thousand times  And so it gets  Reinforced a little bit  Yeah  Yeah  Well I always wondered  What the hell it was  And until the book  Came out  I got a question  For Barry Williams  Yes  Can I smell your chin  Oh man  I'm going to be  In more than hot water  Worth it  Worth it

[02:21:30]  Oh who cares  Oliver  Oliver Oliver  He grew up to be  He grew up to be John Denver  Did you ever smack him  What a bad idea  That's when it really took a turn  I mean you knew from the first episode  Oliver showed up  Our show was going off the air  Why are they bringing him in  That was one of those ideas  They wanted to young up  The subjects of the episodes  Young it up  Young them up  You know I don't know  Yeah they started  Like you guys were  Starting to get a little old 
[02:22:00]  Here's what's interesting  He is  Robbie Rist is his name  He's actually a cool guy  He's an alternative rocker  For real  Oh my god  They all turn into punk rockers  He absolutely is  He's got three colors of hair  None of them blonde  Magenta is in there  Fuchsia  Something else  And he plays for alternative bands  On the LA band circuit  Really  And he does voices for cartoons  Bob Reed must have loved him  I don't think so  In fact Bob didn't like him  I'm sure  On the show  It wrecked the storyline 
[02:22:30]  More than Bob thought it was room before  Oh it was terrible  Then we really went over the  All right let's go to John  John what's going on  Hey how you doing ONA  Great  I wanted to ask Greg a question  In the Hawaiian episode  Did he spray a map of Hawaii  On Marsha's back  So he could find a way  His way around the islands  Leave a map of Hawaii  On Marsha's back  You ever hear that term  Yeah  That's another term  On our show  The important thing is  You can't just spray Oahu  With her you've got to use Maui

[02:24:00]  Question for Barry  What we really want to know  Is about young Oliver  No  No  What  Oliver  Did Mike Brady have a camera  Underneath the trampoline  He's got all those  That old gag  Hey  Well you were the one  Who was underneath  The Brady staircase  Just an hour ago  Well I always thought  Because the backs  Weren't on the stairs  That they were built  So you could see up  The girls' dresses  Built for you  So that you could see  The girls' dresses  And from the first episode  I thought that 
[02:24:30]  I was like  God  I gotta tell you something  You know I went back  And we filmed this  The growing up Brady movie  This was going to be on Sunday  And so we recreated  That entire set  Including the stairs  Without the backs of the steps  That was the most popular spot  On Paramount Studios  We had secretaries  And people  And visitors  And dignitaries  Everybody wanted to jump  On that staircase  Take a picture  It was a stairwell  Well of course  In size order  And I don't mind telling you  That I was underneath  That staircase  Looking up  You are  See  I know it 
[02:25:00]  Oh man  That would have been  This says it all  John from Jersey  Hey ONA  This guy is actually  One of your best guests  You've ever had on  I can't believe  I'm saying this  Greg Brady  Is pretty effing cool  Alright  I'm starting to like  Your listeners  Sure  They're hard to come around  But once they do  Faithful  Yeah  Faithful to the end  That's nice  I'll take faithful  Let's go to Ken real fast  Ken what's up  What's up  Hey  Shut that radio off  God damn it  Alright it's off  It's down  Alright what do you got for Barry  Yeah I want to know  What happened to the dog
