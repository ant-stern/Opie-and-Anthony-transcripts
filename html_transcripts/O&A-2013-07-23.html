<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with Opie's frustrating experience with jury duty, ultimately postponed due to a trip to Montreal.  This transitioned into a gripe session about New York City traffic, specifically the LIE. The hosts then satirized the extensive media coverage of the royal baby's birth, mocking the excessive attention and speculating, in a humorous and often crude way, about the paternity of Princes William and Harry and Queen Elizabeth II's lifestyle.  The crash landing of a plane at LaGuardia Airport was discussed, highlighting the speed of social media news dissemination.  A significant portion of the show focused on Bill O'Reilly's commentary on the Trayvon Martin case and his criticisms of the African-American community, prompting a heated debate with the hosts and a caller.  Profane language and offensive remarks were frequent throughout this section.

The show continued with a caller, Amanda, discussing videos of young black children in sexually suggestive poses, sparking a debate about cultural context, illegitimacy, and the difficulties of discussing race without accusations of racism.  This segued into an analysis of a debate between Larry Elder and Piers Morgan on issues facing the Black community, with the hosts and callers engaging in a heated discussion about racial profiling and accusations of racism. The tone shifted to lighter fare with a discussion about upcoming guests Nikki Glaser and Sarah Schaefer (promoting their MTV show), Ray Mancini, and the movie *Twister*, including clips and anecdotes. The hosts also promoted a benefit for a sick comedian, Otto, and played and discussed Bob Levy's song parodies mocking Howard Stern and Anthony Cumia.

A discussion on potty training methods, including humorous anecdotes about public defecation in China, led back to the royal baby and body image expectations for the Duchess. The hosts then made disparaging, sexually explicit comments about British men and women, and speculated on Pippa Middletonâ€™s dating life.  Nikki Glaser and Sarah Schaefer joined the show, discussing *Catfish* and online dating.  In-studio guest Ray "Boom Boom" Mancini discussed his boxing career, early retirement, and the documentary "The Good Son," touching on his family history and the Retired Boxers Association. The show also covered various reality TV shows like *Toddlers & Tiaras*, *Little People, Big World*, and *Honey Boo Boo*,  featured a video of a woman having a tantrum, and concluded with clips showcasing women's breasts from various sources, including a WWE Raw nipple slip and clips from *Orange is the New Black*.

The broadcast then shifted to an anecdote about a humorous encounter with a snow shoveler, followed by a heated video argument between James and Whitney, which led to a discussion about difficult relationships, featuring anecdotes from the hosts and a male guest about dealing with demanding ex-wives or partners, often involving alcohol abuse.  Several callers shared similar relationship struggles, including issues with infidelity, alcoholism, codependency, and sex addiction.  A clip of Louis C.K. on the Daily Show was played, and the segment mentioned Andrew Dice Clay, who was an earlier in-studio guest. The segment concluded with Jim Norton taking over for his advice show.

Jim Norton's advice segment featured numerous callers with relationship problems.  One caller struggled with communicating sexual needs with his partner.  A recovering alcoholic, Phil, expressed anxieties about dating.  Another caller, Andy, discussed his relationship with a much older woman whose son resembled him.  Other calls involved a comedian seeking advice on joke writing, a man whose wife's religious views clashed with his, a caller whose father-in-law was dating his deceased wife's best friend, a 15-year-old boy dating a 14-year-old girl, and a man whose girlfriend was addicted to painkillers.  Norton's advice was often laced with profanity.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel.  And now, a show the likes of which America's never seen.  So appalling, so offensive, yet so entertaining.  It's not your normal show.  Beamed from satellites in space down to you every single day.  What?  Where did we live with us?  It's the Opie and Anthony Show with Opie.  We're experts and we already know this is going to be great radio.  So shut the fuck up. 
[00:00:30]  And Anthony.  I live in a big house.  I make a lot of money and I fuck attractive girls.  And little Jimmy.  I don't even like an R opening.  It sounds like a little.  What?  He's the dang open and it only is the dang open.  Stop.  Stop with that shit.  I know.  Here they are.  Why am I introducing these buffoons?  I'm William Shatner, goddammit.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:00]  Anthony stuck in horrible traffic. 
[00:01:30]  We'll be here shortly.  Saying worst ride ever.  I don't know what the hell is going on out there today.  Who the fuck knows?  New York City traffic.  That's all you need to know.  Back from jury duty.  Everyone wanted to know what happened at jury duty.  I got a postponement after two and a half hours. 
[00:02:00]  Holy fuck.  Was the guy a fan?  Were you able to find someone who was a fan?  No.  Yeah.  You get lucky sometimes.  I get recognized every fucking day.  But when you need to be recognized, it never happens.  I walked in there with my chest out like, all right.  It's only a matter of time before someone recognizes me and gets me the fuck out of here.  But as soon as I left, after about two and a half hours, I'm about a block away from the courts, the courthouse.  And a guy's getting in his truck and he goes, hey, Opie. 
[00:02:30]  I'm like, oh, great.  Thanks.  I needed you like two fucking hours ago.  He goes, heard you talking about this today on the radio.  I was wondering if I'd see you down here.  Well, you did.  They were very nice.  Yeah.  They are very, very nice in the courts.  But it takes for fucking ever.  You get online just to get inside.  You have to go through metal detectors.  You finally can do that.  Then you have to wait forever at the elevator bank because everyone is showing up at the exact same fucking time.  In my case, I had to go to the 11th floor. 
[00:03:00]  I get into a giant room with really, really nice comfy chairs because they know you're going to be in there a while.  A long room, though.  Very long.  And then the lady's like, well, before I answer any questions and tell you what's going on and before you could ask me any questions, here's a short film.  And it was Ed Bradley and Diane Sawyer from about fucking 80 years ago talking about the judicial system in America.  And the short film felt like it was two and a half hours, but I think it might have been at least a half hour. 
[00:03:30]  And that half hour, I'm sitting there.  I almost stood up, Jimmy.  I almost stood up and said, who doesn't know this shit?  Right.  I was so mad.  They were basically going through the basics of a trial and picking jurors and what your responsibility is.  And then the lawyers will present evidence.  And sometimes the lawyers will have to approach the bench to talk to the judge.  It was like, are you kidding?  Who doesn't know this stuff?  Right.  I would say 80% of the people, 90% of the people in the room know. 
[00:04:00]  So for the 10% that are that stupid, have them raise their hands as being stupid people and bring them into another room for the film.  And then I'm watching and I'm getting really pissed because I see Ed Bradley and Diane Sawyer and I'm thinking, they're telling us about being a juror and they've never had a serve.  I guarantee it.  So why the fuck am I listening to you?  Anyway, then the film was over and then she goes through a million fucking things of, you know, what could get you out of jury duty technically, even though they don't really want anyone to get out of jury duty. 
[00:04:30]  And they said it's a two-day minimum nowadays.  It used to be one day where you sat there and if you got to the end of the day, then you're good.  But now it's a two-day minimum.  And then after that, you could still be called for a case.  So then I'm like, ooh, we're flying out Wednesday for Montreal, Canada.  And I also didn't have my original copy.  And you have to kind of like, you know, rip cards off the original.  Perforated. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, the perforation shit.  And you got to rip your individual cards, A, B, and C.  And you got to give A here and B here and you keep C.  I don't know.  And I didn't have that form.  I had a copy that Kenny made before I left yesterday.  Right.  I forgot my original at home.  So I finally got up there and I said, look, I don't have an original copy.  Oh, she goes, anyone have any questions?  The whole room goes to the front.  So now I'm on that line for a while.  And then I finally got to ask my question.  I said, I don't have an original.  She goes, okay, you got to go to 60 Center Street, room 139. 
[00:05:30]  So then I have to leave that building.  I go to another building and I have to go through the whole thing all over again, going through the metal detectors.  I get through the metal detectors in this new building and I'm looking around for 139.  It's on the ground floor, obviously.  I'm 139.  And I see this massive line that goes across this massive lobby, a rotunda.  It was a rotunda.  And I go, oh, fuck.  Of course that's 139.  So I get to the back of that line, easily on that line for a half hour. 
[00:06:00]  I get to the front of the line and I finally talk to the guy.  And I go, look, I don't have my original copy.  They're like, no problem.  We'll get you one.  They were going to give me an original copy and send me back to the place I started in.  And then I go, look, I'm flying out Wednesday.  I got to go to Montreal.  They didn't even ask me what I did or any of that shit.  And as soon as I said that, he goes, oh, you can't serve.  I'm like, yeah, exactly.  Now it's like 11, 11.15. 
[00:06:30]  So I've been down there for over two hours already waiting to tell him that I can't serve technically.  He should have snuck it in.  He should have said, look, I'm not sure what to do here because I host a radio show and he might have heard of it.  Sometimes you've got to sneak it in there and it might help.  I know.  So then he goes, well, when would you like to serve?  That was the only attitude I got the entire time is down there.  I go, look, I want to serve.  But if you're telling me that I have to be available Wednesday, I can't do it.  I will be flying.  I'm not making this shit up.  And then I finally looked at the calendar and said, how's October? 
[00:07:00]  I go, well, October sounds wonderful.  So now I've got to postpone and I've got to go back in October to start all over again.  Yeah, I don't know what the process is.  60 Center Street is where I had to go, too.  Oh, really?  But I couldn't do it because I have to go in August.  Right.  And I just can't fucking deal.  That's why I moved to New York City.  I couldn't deal with the fucking commute anymore.  That's the only reason why I live in New York City is because of his face right now. 
[00:07:30]  It's fucking kissable.  It isn't even like it's ridiculous.  It doesn't happen a lot.  But when it does, you just want to fucking open fire.  What was the problem out there today?  Yeah, exactly.  The Grand Central fucking construction is some shit.  Exactly.  Because, you know, the best time to fix one of the major arteries into the city is during rush hour, you know, morning fucking traffic.  And when are they going to pave that part of the LIE?  I know I'm going real local right now. 
[00:08:00]  But there's a part of the LIE that backs up horribly.  And it's relatively close to New York City.  It's about less than 10 miles out, maybe eight miles out from the tunnel that is not paved.  So everyone has to slow the fuck down because, you know, they have to go over that tiny little, what is it, a half inch bump into some rough road that they're going to eventually pave?  If they haven't paved it, it's a combination of the road suck, the construction, I don't know how they schedule this shit, and people, like, the second you throw any distraction in their way, driving, they become fucking retards. 
[00:08:30]  Everyone falls apart.  They can't fucking do it.  And then you throw in some rain because it was really pouring out on Long Island.  Just now?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  When I left.  That's weird.  You're only over there.  Yeah.  And we're over here.  I'm over here.  And you throw that in, and people just fuck it.  They think that it's ice falling from the sky in the middle of fucking daggers.  Yeah, yeah, daggers, ice, fire, and a storm of frogs. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  Ah, it's fucking accurate.  That's ridiculous.  It was so fucking annoying.  And you just watch the clock ticking away.  Ticking away.  And you're like, there's nothing you can do.  Ah, what are you going to do?  Rush to the next accident?  You relax, you open your container of coffee, you listen to the radio.  Regular Joe can suck a dick.  Regular Joes hate fucking traffic, period.  That's the one thing they hate.  They're cool with everything else, but they hate fucking traffic. 
[00:09:30]  What's that fucking annoying?  How about on the LIE?  And I'm sure the other cities have this, so certainly they can relate.  They'll say, traffic delays exit 38 to 24.  I know what you're going to say.  And that makes people immediately slow down right away because they read the sign.  Right away.  And I would beg the fucking people that that's an automated sign. 
[00:10:00]  No one is at the switch going, well, we just got a report that there's heavy traffic  between 38 and 24, so we better put the warning up.  No, they put that exact warning up every fucking day because they know eventually that area  is going to be really slow.  Yeah, yeah.  But people start slowing down immediately because they see that.  And then you get through that area going, look, no, there's no heavy traffic.  But everyone's slowed down. 
[00:10:30]  Just keep going fast until you see the heavy traffic.  Keep going fast.  That's fucking...  Keep going fast.  That'd be great.  Keep going fast.  If only that happened.  So, fuck.  That's why...  I'll say it again.  That's why I moved to New York City.  That commute finally got the best of me.  I would love to live on Long Island.  I would love it.  For the most part.  It's 25 minutes from my house, door to door, 25 minutes.  I was in the car for an hour.  For an hour.  Just sitting in traffic. 
[00:11:00]  You're lucky, though.  People do it every fucking day.  Every day.  Yeah, yeah.  Every fucking day.  Good luck to you.  Good luck to you.  And then we got a dumb mayor that worries about your soda intake.  Yeah.  How about you worry about people's stress intake?  Because a ride like that, day after day, absolutely causes heart attacks.  Oh, God.  Absolutely.  I live six miles outside the city by Lincoln.  I had to move in years ago because I couldn't handle the tunnel traffic.  I just couldn't do it anymore.  Yeah.  Six minutes.  Six miles. 
[00:11:30]  It literally should have got me 10 minutes, 12 minutes into the city.  It's just infuriating.  Yeah, it's a huge island with how many million people?  Yeah.  And they decided, oh, we'll give them two tunnels and two bridges.  That's enough.  That's good enough to get everyone on the island.  Just a couple of major roadways into the pinnacle of the free world.  That's all we need.  Give them two tunnels.  Ah, fuck.  Let's throw a third bridge in there.  That's fine.  That's good enough. 
[00:12:00]  I'll tell you.  If I wasn't able to take my mind off the traffic thinking about the wonderful little royal baby,  I really would have been upset.  Yeah.  It's unbelievable.  It's embarrassing that America cares.  Let those idiots over there care about it.  I know.  But you see our news programs all a titter.  It was fucking...  All a titter.  They wouldn't stop.  I mean, I could understand even, you know, that it's news. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  So you go, all right, this is what happened.  And, like, hours they were spending on this.  Well, one news agency had a live shot just on the hospital door, I guess.  Or the front of the hospital.  Why?  And then another news channel, maybe we can find this.  They decided, well, Kate Middleton's in labor.  Let's find another broad that's in labor right now.  And they were broadcasting from the delivery room of just this broad. 
[00:13:00]  What did that have to do with anything?  I had no idea.  It doesn't make any sense.  I love watching the news every day because it's just completely ridiculous.  It really is.  Especially when you get stories like this.  Because there's no need to spend hours...  None.  None.  ...waiting for the big announcement to go up on the easel.  On that dumb easel.  And have the wacky guy from the Beefeaters Gin Bottle come out.  Right.  And fucking... 
[00:13:30]  Hear ye!  Hear ye!  Is there any reason for anyone to yell, hear ye, in 2013?  That's why we started America.  We were sick of the, hear ye!  Hear ye!  With his scroll.  Right.  He had a scroll.  We had it with scrolls.  So we said, let's move over here now.  Yes, I want freedom from scrolls.  Right.  And idiots that don't smile or move when you go up to them and ask them directions. 
[00:14:00]  No thank you.  Our police officers, they're wonderful.  Right.  If you go up to them, they're not going to fucking stare at you stoically.  They're going to actually try to help you.  Fuck.  Enough with the baby.  Hear ye!  Hear ye!  We proclaim on this day!  Do you?  It's like Groundhog Day.  He peeked out of her vagina.  Oh my God.  So what do you think?  The kid's going to get...  If the kid has Kate Middleton's looks, then you've got a cute baby. 
[00:14:30]  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  If you've got the father's looks, then you've got a...  Then there's a problem.  Then you've got a dud.  A little dunce.  A dud.  A little fucking fuddy-duddy.  And a long line of fuddy-duddy-looking men.  The long royal succession of fuddy-duddies.  Except for the younger brother, who obviously has a different father.  Right.  Bringing in some of that rock star blood.  They were showing them last night, you know, some clips of the two boys there, the princes. 
[00:15:00]  And every time you see them, it's just...  Every year that goes by, it's more and more obvious that they just don't have the same dad.  No, they're...  Of course.  Any similarity and looks they have are all Diana.  Of course.  She was rocking that royal vag.  Yes, she was.  Mm-hmm.  Well, because Prince Charles was probably a horrible fuck.  Oh, you could just...  Even the son there, the fucking... 
[00:15:30]  What's his name?  Fucking...  I don't know.  No, the one that just had the baby.  The one that just had the baby.  William.  William.  Oh, yeah.  Prince William.  Okay.  Now I know.  Yeah, now I know.  I don't care.  I know.  Even Prince William is a fucking...  Looks like a fuddy-duddy fuck.  If you can find the media just being stupid about this royal baby, please bring it to my  attention because, like I said, you know, do it over there, but not over here.  It didn't merit two hours of coverage. 
[00:16:00]  Fucking jury duty was...  Yeah, how'd that go?  One long line.  They were really nice down there, though, I gotta say.  Yeah.  Did they know who you were?  No.  Oh.  No.  No.  As soon as I left, they did.  A guy was getting into his car.  Oh, really?  NYPD guy, obviously undercover.  Yeah.  Or maybe...  Yeah, it must have been undercover.  I guess.  And he said, hey, yo.  I go, hey.  And he goes, I heard you talking about this today.  I was wondering if I was going to see you down in these parks. 
[00:16:30]  I go, well, it's too bad you didn't see me two hours ago.  It's too bad you don't know anyone inside.  What was the rigmarole you had to go through?  It's two-day minimum now.  What do you mean?  Remember the old days, if you got through one day of jury duty and you weren't called  for anything, you're done?  Yeah.  Now it's two days.  You have to be there two days.  Yep.  So, you gotta go back?  In October.  Because then, after two days, you still gotta possibly be available for a case.  The fuck is this? 
[00:17:00]  The Army Reserve?  Well, let's say you get picked late in the second day.  That means you gotta come back for the third day.  Oh, man.  So, you gotta be technically available for three days.  Man.  And we got the Montreal trip Wednesday.  Uh-huh.  So, then at that point, I'm like, man, I could take the chance and stay down here two days  and get it over with.  But if I get called and then I have to tell them I can't serve, then they might throw me  back in the system.  So, I said, fuck that.  So, then I told them I couldn't serve.  I'm giving you the short version.  I just told Jimmy the whole fucking thing. 
[00:17:30]  Damn.  And then they're like, yeah, you can't serve.  I'm like, yeah, I know I can't serve.  So, now what?  And the guy goes, well, when would you like to serve?  Never.  That was the only attitude I got.  Well, when would you like?  Never, sir.  I wish I could say never.  Yeah.  Figured out October might be good for everybody.  So, I have to go back in October and start all over again.  That's good.  That's like never.  August is a good time.  August is a good time.  Because, yeah, there's a lot of people who are away or whatever.  I hear August comes.  I mean, you know, I say that and then watch me get out of a fucking giant murder insurance 
[00:18:00]  scam case.  It takes nine months sequestered.  Oh, you'd go crazy.  It wouldn't happen.  No.  Wouldn't happen.  We're sequestering you.  I'll throw duty at the other jurors.  I'll shit in my hand and throw duty at the other people.  And, you know, we finally got to ask our questions, you know, and everyone has a question.  And one guy, he's 86 years old.  He was right in front of me with his question.  And his question is, I can't hear. 
[00:18:30]  Oh, no.  I just want you to know I can't hear.  Oh.  That's all they need.  And the lady, the lady's like, well, okay, sit over there, you know.  They don't want to, like, say, you know, all right, that's fine to anyone.  Right.  But that's all he would say.  I can't hear.  I can't hear.  I can't hear.  They're going after 86-year-olds for jury duty?  He goes, I'm 86 years old.  I can't hear.  She was nice to him, but made him sit back down. 
[00:19:00]  I guess the jury polls are really small these days.  Everyone tries to get out of it, so.  You can tell the whole room is filled with people just trying to figure it out.  They're trying to figure it out.  And you can see some people that were just going to run away.  Yeah.  Because you get so frustrated.  I have to say it again because you weren't here.  They show you a film.  Oh, I saw the film.  You saw the film.  When I was gone.  But why can't you ask the questions before the film?  Because now you've got to sit through the film when you might have a legitimate question  that might get you to, in my case, I had to leave where I was and go to another building. 
[00:19:30]  They want to show you the film.  Well, and it's supposed to be a short film.  Oh, yeah.  It felt like two, two and a half hours, but I think it was about a half hour, right?  Was it all about the jury system?  Yes!  Yeah, yeah.  I told Jimmy, I go, I swear to you, I had the urge.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I almost stood up and said, who doesn't know this shit?  It was like court 101.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And everyone in there knows, except for maybe, I don't know, less than 10% of the people. 
[00:20:00]  You're entitled to a jury of your peers.  Holy fuck, I'm like, I know!  And then it's Diane Sawyer and Ed Bradley, and I'm like, they never served on the jury,  so why are they telling me about jury duty?  It's the same movie?  It's the same movie, because mine was in Nassau County.  Diane Sawyer was young, man.  Yeah, it's a whole movie.  And Ed Bradley's no longer with us, right?  Do you think the movie's more than 20 years old?  Yeah.  Close.  Yeah, probably just about.  Close. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  Close.  And it is.  I was watching it, too, just going like, this is such basic knowledge of things.  It was unbelievable.  Can't you just have people raise their hand?  Who doesn't know about the court system in America?  And then bring those dummies to a separate room, and then the rest of us could get on  the long line to try to get out of jury duty.  That's what the line's called.  Start rocking the let's get the fuck out of here stories.  Because no one had a question.  Like, I got a question.  Should I check this box or this box?  It was all like, I'm a teacher. 
[00:21:00]  I have 18 kids at home.  I was robbed once.  Right.  I kind of enjoyed it.  As much as I bitched about it.  That's a life experience.  I will have no problem sitting around there for a couple days.  Yeah.  Just taking it all in.  Because I love looking at people.  Soaking it in.  I'm a people watcher.  But the guy, the old guy, 86.  Holy fuck.  I can't hear.  That's all he said.  Poor old bastard.  I mean, you didn't go, look, you're 86. 
[00:21:30]  You served your country.  Go home.  Go home.  Enjoy the last few years of your life.  Yeah.  Why fucking tie up this guy?  You know what?  A few days works out to be a percentage of that guy's life.  Of course.  That he has left.  Of course.  Jesus.  That was funny, though.  Help him out.  Send him home.  Mm-hmm.  The royal baby.  So what's the big...  Are they going to announce the name today?  Uh, oh, who knows?  Boy, are they so secretive.  And did you hear about the, uh, the queen twat there? 
[00:22:00]  What about her?  She...  She is quite the twat.  Yes, she is.  The one thing I heard yesterday was if they don't announce the birth of this baby before  nine o'clock their time, this bitch, you can respect her all you want across the pond,  but this bitch goes to bed at nine...  Yeah, you can't rouse her.  ...and she refused to stay awake knowing that, you know, uh, the birth was imminent.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess imminent at that point because no one really knew for sure.  She refused to stay up past her bedtime. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  So if she, if they didn't give birth before nine o'clock, they would have to wait to the  next day to tell the world until this bitch wakes up and has her morning tea.  Wake the queen.  And, and these people deal with that shit over there?  Who would deal with that shit?  Well, she probably, because she's so old.  She probably has...  She's been going to bed at nine forever.  Oh, is that what it is?  Forever, yeah.  Do you know she makes $32 million a year?  Doing what?  Exactly.  Just, just... 
[00:23:00]  Showing up at shit.  Being the queen earns her $32 million a year.  I would like almost a million.  I'd say $750,000 a month.  It's, it's, it's crazy.  I would love to know what her actual skill is.  Every single person has some kind of skill out there.  What is hers?  For real.  What is it?  The wave.  She, she did the queen wave thing.  No one did that before her.  She started that?  Yeah, I think she started the old wrist twist.  But what is she good at?  Um, back in like World War II days, she was pretty handy with a fucking wrench. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  On a jeep.  Working on jeeps and she, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's good for her.  But now?  There's a lot of guys that know how to take a wrench to a jeep.  They're not making $32 million a year.  No.  What the fuck?  Who is her husband?  The king.  When did he die?  I don't know.  The guy in the 50s or 60s?  Did he?  Who died?  She's, her husband was king.  When you see the king's speech, was that her father?  Really? 
[00:24:00]  Wait, her husband's still alive.  No, Philip's a newer one.  He's not.  Oh, she was, she was married before that guy.  I'm thinking, is she not?  Oh, no.  He's still alive.  Yeah, no, I know he's still alive.  No, Prince Philip, I know that.  He was just in the hospital recently with bad duties or something.  Wait.  Prince Philip is her only husband.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So she was never married to a king.  No, that guy who has to sit there and fucking...  Prince Philip, just be the fucking cuck.  The queen's cuck.  This guy just eat her ass, I guess.  Oh, God. 
[00:24:30]  Imagine that.  That's his royal duty to eat the queen's ass.  Royal duty.  Yeah.  She was the daughter of King George.  Oh, and he was the one who started her, right?  From the king's speech.  Okay.  King's speech was her father.  Look at this.  So many fucking educated people.  Wait, did he have no sons or whatever that could do the throne?  No son.  So she became queen, but this guy...  You can't marry in and be king, but you can marry in and be queen.  Is that what it is?  She never married in.  I am.  No, no, no.  But I'm saying Philip. 
[00:25:00]  How come Philip's not king?  Because he's not part of the bloodline.  His brother stepped down to marry the divorcee.  Right.  Yeah.  And who was that brother?  That was George's brother.  You can't marry in.  Yeah, you can't marry in, but it used to be the first son born, but they're changing the  rules.  God, how do I know this?  Because I was watching this dumb shit as much as I made fun of it.  They changed the rules, so now it is the first birth.  Oh, okay.  So if they had a daughter, she would be queen someday. 
[00:25:30]  She'd still be able to.  Even if they went on to have a son.  Oh, for other terms, you're completely correct.  Yeah, they have officially changed the rules, or they're going to.  Oh, so if they had a daughter and then they had a son, the son's shit out of luck.  Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  And now Harry doesn't even have a fucking chance now.  I don't give a fuck.  He doesn't care.  He's banging broads in Vegas.  He's a party animal.  He doesn't want it.  He doesn't want.  He's so fucking cool, this kid.  He doesn't even want it.  It goes from Prince Charles now to William, now to this little fucker. 
[00:26:00]  Oh, over Harry?  Yeah.  Yes.  Harry's the fucking, he's Fredo.  He's Fredo.  I get stepped over.  I get stepped over.  He's leaning back in a chair with a fucking pussy on his face.  Even if he loves box.  Even if Prince William dies, tragically, let's say.  Yeah, they just, I guess they'll just wait it out to the kid.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Well, but there's Prince Charles first, who's been waiting forever.  Oh, yeah.  You know that guy's only 64 years old?  Prince Charles?  He looks like shit.  He does. 
[00:26:30]  I thought he was like 70.  He's only 64.  We've known him our entire lives.  He's just always been there.  Fucking fuddy-duddy.  He's only 64.  How old's the queen?  She's what, 84?  She's not, she's old, but she's not 98.  I mean, she's got to be mid-80s.  She could have 15 more years.  I would bet 88.  I'm going 88, Sam Roberts.  And I think Prince Philip's in his fucking 90s.  Yeah.  That was me trying to make it cool by saying fucking...  I like it.  Old Liz.  How old is she? 
[00:27:00]  She is 87.  87 years.  She's what, 92?  She's 88, though.  When's her birthday?  April.  Fuck!  April.  April.  Son of a...  The Queen Mum.  Yeah, the Queen Mum.  Yeah, they're talking about it over here.  All right.  Victoria, we're going to come back to this in a little bit, but we want to get to some of  the other news that's going on.  Oh, that's a big bitch.  Holy fuck, she's huge. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, and that red.  Look at her.  Oh, my God.  What happened with that plane?  What's going on with planes?  Was that LaGuardia?  Yeah.  What happened?  That was a good one.  Scary landing in LaGuardia.  Yeah, I guess they were having a little issue with their landing gear.  Yeah.  And they came in, and the nose gear collapsed.  Wow.  And it dragged the nose on the runway, a bunch of sparks and stuff, and some smoke in the  cabin.  Right.  From the friction and stuff. 
[00:28:00]  And then it stopped.  I guess they realized there was no fire.  The fire trucks pulled up.  They kept the doors closed for a little while while they foamed down the whole fucking thing.  And then they opened up the doors, put the slides out, and people slid out.  Took some really cool close-up pictures, too.  Like, people were just like, hey, look, I was just in a plane crash.  Wow.  And now there's video.  But, like, the odds of catching some kind of problem with a plane was very slim back  in the day.  Now, the last one you saw a little piece of, this one, you got video of it sliding down 
[00:28:30]  the runway.  Crazy.  It is amazing.  We were just talking about how LaGuardia is a scary airport to come into.  Yeah, I think if they knew there was a landing gear problem, they would have had them go to  Kennedy.  And they have a short landing area, right?  Yeah.  Landing strip or whatever?  Yep.  But no one really hurt that bad.  Us Long Islanders see those planes landing in LaGuardia, and they take that sharp left  banking turn to set up their landing. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, it's crazy over there.  You know, you fly out to Vegas or Arizona, you don't even notice your landing because it's  just one straight, no maneuvers whatsoever, just slowly just descending in a straight line  for...  Approach from the horizon.  It doesn't matter.  For hundreds of miles.  Yeah.  But these New York City airports, man, they have to make some fucking moves.  Like, ah, there's a building.  Ah, there's a bridge.  Ah, now we gotta go down.  Okay, land quick!  How about landing at Kennedy? 
[00:29:30]  All of a sudden they go out into the ocean.  Yeah, yeah.  And then the wing pretty much dips into the ocean as it now turns back toward Kennedy.  That is creepy looking.  Toward Kennedy.  Newark isn't as bad.  Newark is pretty smooth.  You come in pretty smooth, but...  Yeah, it was just with all the buildings and...  Creepy.  And then there's...  They change things around because people bitch around about the sound and shit like  that, so they have the planes do a little zigging and zagging over some neighborhoods  to avoid some of the neighborhoods. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  So, yeah, you do kind of really fucking...  You're all over the place.  Right.  But this guy, yeah...  Where was this coming in from?  Nashville?  Oh, wow.  I think.  Northwest?  I think it was Nashville.  Southwest, yeah.  Oh, Southwest.  Southwest plane fucking...  Right.  Hank.  That was that.  But, yeah, people were getting off and then turning around immediately and just taking pictures.  Like, yeah, I just came off of this thing.  It's fucked up.  That is fucked up.  Yeah, I saw you tweet it yesterday. 
[00:30:30]  I thought...  Stupid me.  I thought it was, like, somewhere else from a faraway lawn.  Oh, oh, yeah.  I didn't know it was in our backyard until later on in the day.  It's amazing.  I had the news on, too, and they were going off on this stupid fucking royal baby thing.  But it's amazing the delay between when it happened.  Because I saw the tweet from New York City Aviation.  I followed them on the Twitter.  And it was immediate.  Of course.  It was like, oh, there's a problem.  Plane nose gear collapsed.  Of course.  And then they started posting pictures. 
[00:31:00]  So I got some of those and retweeted them.  And then it was, like, an hour later.  The news was like, this is just coming in from LaGuardia.  Here's our live picture.  It's like, this happened an hour ago.  Why are they?  In this day and age.  Why are they up to speed?  I don't know.  Like, we are.  The regulars out there with Twitter accounts.  You would think.  Because they're following the same shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, you would think.  Why wouldn't you pop up a picture, you know, immediately on your newscast?  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  They probably had to get the anchor.  We got to get the anchor and get him in here.  Get him in here.  Enough of this royal baby.  So we can report the story.  We need our number one anchor for this story.  Where is he?  Oh, he's on the golf course, sir.  But social media has just been amazing with that.  You know, you got to take the, eh, people.  But in between that, you're getting news the second it happens from people that are right  the fuck there.  Yep.  It's quite amazing indeed.  Yeah, they're becoming antiquated, the news. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  Aren't they now?  Yeah, they were the ones that told you what was happening in the world.  And now you just find out from the people that it's happening to.  Yeah, thank you.  Yeah, thanks a lot.  And by the way, less filters that way.  Yes, less filters.  That's why I like it.  That's why I like going to Twitter for news.  Less filters.  When you didn't get the news for a good 24-hour, international news especially, you didn't  get it for a day.  Like, they would talk about the nom.  And it was yesterday's nom news. 
[00:32:30]  And you'd get like, oh, here's what happened today in Vietnam and the city of Sway.  And it was like, oh, that was yesterday.  Now something happens and you're like, you know, immediately.  Right.  Pretty fucking amazing.  There's a story in the paper today.  I just realized.  I think there's a few.  Well, there's a really good one.  You know, that heat wave brings out fucking lunatics.  Oh, yeah.  I've always said it.  If you want to like get some real good people watching in, when a heat wave hits New York 
[00:33:00]  City or probably most cities, the fucking people that are scared to go outside, go outside because  they can't handle their hot apartments anymore.  They can handle it when it's 80, 85.  But when you start pushing 100, it forces all these people out.  And then you get lunatics walking the street and then they go back in when it goes back  down to 80.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  I've noticed this for years.  What do they do? 
[00:33:30]  They walk the streets like.  Oh, yeah.  You get some fucking crazy.  You get a lot more crazies out there.  No, not the type of crazies that are going to hurt you.  Like violent.  No, no.  Like what?  Fucking agoraphobics.  Oh, yeah.  Things like that.  Talking to themselves.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  All that shit.  Problems.  You know, people that'll just walk around collecting cigarette butts because they have  to or something will happen to them if they don't.  Those people.  But anyway.  Step on a crack, break your mother's back, kind of fucking playing hopscotch down the 
[00:34:00]  sidewalk.  But there's a story in the paper.  I got to find the paper.  One of the public pools.  Oh, yeah.  Did you hear about the broad and the pink thong?  And the bikini that was.  Oh, you heard.  Yeah, I heard on the news on the way in.  Yeah, it was on 1010 Winds.  What the fuck was her problem?  I love it.  Not a problem, I guess.  She turned it.  She was a hoe.  She.  At a public pool, she decided to find a pole and started gyrating against the pole.  She was twerking, I guess.  Is that what they're saying?  Yeah, she was twerking against the pole.  She's holding on to the pole and shaking that. 
[00:34:30]  There he is.  Heey, heey, heey.  Oh, look at his face.  1937 with his scroll.  Fucking dressed like an asshole.  Why would you dress like that?  It's oldie style.  I got to find dirty pool perps.  Oh, yeah.  We were posting some video of that part of Braveheart where Longshank's son and his gay lover.  I am. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, what did he say?  I'm an expert in the arts of war.  Oh, who is this giving me?  And he throws him out the window.  What a great scene that is.  A sick scene.  Fuck.  I don't know.  I hope this version of the story is good.  I think I read the other paper.  The heat wave sent tempers flaring and hormones raging at pools across the city last week.  More than a dozen people were arrested at public swimming pools for fighting and other bad behavior, including a 21-year-old woman in a thong swimsuit who gyrated against the pole at High Bridge Pool in Washington Heights. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, boy.  It asked passerbys to smack her behind.  I bet she said ass.  They arrested her for that?  Smack that ass.  Yeah, some kind of indecent shit.  Oh, come on.  How do you arrest that girl?  What a great girl.  It was at a public pool with kids.  Exactly.  Good for the community.  Keep spirits up.  Imagine parents are just like, first of all, if you're a parent and you bring your kid to one of those public pools, you're fucking got to be crazy anyway. 
[00:36:00]  But, you know, I don't think they want to see this woman gyrating like a stripper getting her ass beat.  In a thong, yeah.  And they get smacked or spanked.  I'm sure she said spank me, but they can't put that in the paper, right?  Smack my ass.  I bet she was there.  Come on, smack my ass.  You don't think she said smack my behind?  No.  Give my fanny a swat.  Oh, God, though.  You don't think that's Bronx talk or anything?  No.  Hit my hiney.  Give my backside a friendly whack, gents. 
[00:36:30]  Hey, hey.  She was charged with disorderly conduct, trespassing, obstruction of governmental administration, and resisting arrest after she turned the pool into her own personal strip club.  This rules.  I love shit like this.  Sporting a pink thong and white sandals, grabbed the railing by the pool and performed a striptease act.  She urged swimmers to give her bottom a smack, and some people obliged, while others left the pool in disgust. 
[00:37:00]  Who leaves the pool in disgust?  Maybe those parents again.  Right.  That don't want their little kids seeing that fucking fat ass getting smacked.  She was told to leave.  That's when she went ballistic, cops said.  And then she says, don't hate because I have a body.  It looked good.  Yeah, obviously.  Okay, the cops are going to understand that.  You know, you're right.  You got a body and it looks good.  So, okay, carry on, ma'am.  And then I'm sure there was that resisting arrest charge was because any time you see a black woman getting arrested, the second the cops touch them, they do the, don't touch me. 
[00:37:30]  Don't you touch me.  Right.  And they start trying to get away, and then it's fun, fun, fun, world star hip-hop.  Yeah, she's, let's see, she ended up on the ground when cops tried to escort her away from the pool in a scuffling suit.  And then the cops said that they had a real tough time handcuffing her because she was really slippery from the suncan lotion. 
[00:38:00]  I bet some of that fucking coconut oil.  Yeah.  What was that other page that you had there, Sonny Boy?  13 arrested as pool violence explodes.  In Brooklyn, pool was closed for hours on Sunday morning due to gunshots being fired at the adjacent projects.  Then the Astoria pool, we have arrest of 14-year-old male for disorderly conduct and four others for leaving the pool for other pool-related incidents to police officers and pepper spray to subdue an out-of-control 14-year-old teen on Saturday night. 
[00:38:30]  No, apparently they can't.  What else happened?  Could you scroll a little more?  Uh, is that it?  Two. 
[00:39:00]  Oh, yeah, it came to it.  It says, uh, 20 minutes later, a group of teens, reportedly friends of the 14-year-old involved in the prior incident, uh, were, um, where is that?  Arrested for, uh, robbery.  Sure, good.  Two people during the robbery.  Sure, good.  Uh, they proceeded to steal a cell phone and mini-speakers from one of the men.  When he resisted, he was beaten.  Uh, when friends attempted to intervene, uh, he, too, was assaulted. 
[00:39:30]  Both men were punched numerous times in the process.  Well, it happens.  Yeah.  Um, arrested.  Jay Vaughn, um, yeah, Jay Vaughn, whatever, uh, and then another pool, a Harlem teen was arrested, um, where is that?  For, uh, causing disturbance, Papa Poole was acting in a tumult, what? 
[00:40:00]  Tumultuous?  Tumultuous and violent manner.  Then we got one at the Cratona Pool, the Sunset Pool, arrested, uh, Lorenzo, Luis.  This is, it's just insane.  Who goes to the public pool?  A lot of people go.  You can't just go and swim and stop behaving.  Can't people not be fucking animals?  Just go to the pool and stop acting like cocks? 
[00:40:30]  They, it's, it's, you just don't understand.  Ugh.  Fucking irritates me.  Go to the pool and act, and just fucking act properly.  Try to cool off.  Yeah, go to the pool, take a dip.  Take a dip.  Splash, splash.  Go home.  Fucking animals.  Splash, splash.  You literally, if you can't behave in a public pool, you should just be shot.  Yeah.  Remember the wildings in the public pools years ago?  A girl would go in there, and they would just fucking pretty much rape her in the pool. 
[00:41:00]  I used to enjoy going to the public, uh, pools every once in a while.  I was very, I was sure.  Where at?  As a family, we went down to, um, I believe Jones Beach used to have a huge.  They did, yeah.  Public pool, and, uh, we'd go there.  And I really, really liked it.  Yeah?  Yeah, they had the big fucking diving boards.  The high diving boards, yeah.  And the pool felt like a mini lake.  It was so huge.  I'm sure, uh, nowadays.  We would go in the waves, but the waves would be a little too rough, because we're younger,  so then we'd go into the pool.  I liked it.  Pool to pond.  I didn't mind it, actually.  No? 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  I remember the public pool was fine when I was a kid, but again, it was in Edison.  Yeah, sure.  Oh, it was a different time.  Yeah.  A different neighborhood, I guess.  A different place.  But the chlorine would get you.  They chlorinated it.  Oh, they chlorinate the shit out of it.  Every kid would come out with fucking red on the eyes.  Yeah.  Oh, it's just people being savage in the pool area.  Why?  Right?  They should literally just hire ten cops with fucking billy clubs to stand there, and if  you act wrong, you get your shins smashed, and then you have to limp out with your fucking  barefoot and stinking of chlorine, and a broken shin. 
[00:42:00]  Just smashing people's legs.  Exactly.  McCluskey fucking smashing shins of poorly behaved pool goers.  All right.  Hold him up.  McCluskey.  Punching jaws all over the place.  You're a great dropout, Captain.  Fucking blithering idiots.  Just literally, there are pockets of society.  You're blithering idiots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's no real structure.  There's no...  I guess...  That's kind of what Obama was talking about, too. 
[00:42:30]  And then O'Reilly had a good talking point.  I was in the Fox dress.  I was in his...  By the way, his intern's O'Reilly.  He has one intern who's so beautiful, I almost wept.  Really?  Really?  I wanted to just...  You ever just look at someone and go, I want to cry looking at you.  You're so perfect.  We were watching, and the other...  I did Red Eye.  We were in the agreement.  I couldn't hear a word he said.  But you could see that he was really getting amped up.  He was yelling.  Well, I saw your tweet.  And getting amped.  I saw your tweet where you said, O'Reilly's yelling at me.  O'Reilly's yelling at me.  Because I'm sitting on the couch.  I'm watching it. 
[00:43:00]  And I just felt like I was being talked to by O'Reilly.  Do we have it here?  It was...  Yeah.  Let's listen to this.  This is pretty good.  Oh, wow.  So far, I like it a lot.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  I'm making a great point there.  Subject of this evening's Talking Points Memo.  On Friday, the president delivered surprise remarks to the press about the Trayvon Martin case  and race in general.  His main point, a plea for understanding.  There are very few African-American men in this country who haven't had the experience 
[00:43:30]  of being followed when they were shopping in a department store.  That includes me.  I don't want to exaggerate this, but those sets of experiences inform how the African-American  community interprets what happened one night in Florida.  And that's true.  Many black Americans harbor at least some resentment for past injury.  But what President Obama surely knows is that you cannot reach a fair criminal verdict 
[00:44:00]  or design effective public policy that solves present problems by dwelling on the sins of  the past.  Talking Points believes the president was correct in addressing the race issue and framing it  with the Martin case.  He's the leader of America, and the country's talking about this.  By the way, when you hear a pundit of politicians saying we should have a, quote, conversation  about race, that means you're in for a sea of bloviating, which will likely lead nowhere. 
[00:44:30]  Bloviating.  The sad truth is that from the president on down, our leadership has no clue, no clue at  all, about how to solve problems within the black community.  And many are frightened to even broach the issue.  Yep.  That's because race hustlers and the grievance industry have intimidated the so-called  conversation, turning any valid criticism of African-American culture into charges of  racial bias.  Yes.  So many in power simply walk away, leaving millions of law-abiding African-Americans to  pretty much fend for themselves in violent neighborhoods. 
[00:45:00]  You want racism?  That's racism.  Thus, it is time for some straight talk.  And I hope the president is listening tonight, because we need him to lead on this issue.  Trayvon Martin was killed because circumstances got out of control.  He was scrutinized by neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman because of the way he looked.  Not necessarily his skin color, there's no evidence of that, but because he was a stranger  to Zimmerman and was dressed in clothing sometimes used by street criminals. 
[00:45:30]  It was wrong for Zimmerman to confront Martin based on his appearance.  But the culture that we have in this country does lead to criminal profiling because young  black American men are so often involved in crime.  The statistics, overwhelming.  But here's the headline.  Young black men commit homicides at a rate 10 times greater than whites and Hispanics combined. 
[00:46:00]  There you go.  When presented with damning evidence like that, and like the mini Holocaust in Chicago where  hundreds of African-Americans are murdered each year, the civil rights industry looks the  other way or makes excuses.  They blame guns, poor education, lack of jobs.  Rarely do they define the problem accurately.  So here it is.  The reason there is so much violence and chaos in the black precincts is the disintegration 
[00:46:30]  of the African-American family.  Right now, about 73 percent of all black babies are born out of wedlock.  That drives poverty.  And the lack of involved fathers leads to young boys growing up resentful and unsupervised.  Bingo.  When was the last time you saw a public service ad telling young black girls to avoid becoming 
[00:47:00]  pregnant?  You'd be crucified.  Has President Obama done such an ad?  How about Jackson or Sharpton?  Has a congressional black caucus demanded an ad like that?  How about the PC pundits who work for NBC News?  White people don't force black people to have babies out of wedlock.  That's a personal decision.  A decision that has devastated millions of children and led to disaster both socially and 
[00:47:30]  economically.  So, raised without much structure, young black men often reject education and gravitate towards  the street culture, drugs, hustling, gangs.  Nobody forces them to do that.  Again, it is a personal decision.  But the entertainment industry encourages the irresponsibility by marketing a gangsta culture,  hip-hop movies, trashy TV shows to impressionable children.  In fact, President Obama has welcomed some of the worst offenders in that cesspool to the 
[00:48:00]  White House, when he should be condemning what these weasels are doing.  These so-called entertainers get rich, while the kids who emulate their lyrics and attitude  destroy themselves.  And then there's the drug situation.  Go to Detroit and ask anyone living on the south side of the eight-mile road what destroyed  their city.  They will tell you narcotics. 
[00:48:30]  They know addiction leads to crime and debasement.  But what do the race hustlers and limousine liberals yell about?  The number of black men in prison for selling drugs.  Oh, it's so unfair.  It's a non-violent crime.  And blacks are targeted.  That is one of the biggest lies in the history of this country.  The thugs who sell hard drugs, no matter what color they are, deserve to be put away for  long periods of time, they sell poison, they sell a product that enslaves and kills. 
[00:49:00]  They are scum.  When was the last time you heard the Congressional Black Caucus say that?  How about Jackson and Sharpton?  How about President Obama?  The solution to the epidemic of violent crime in poor black neighborhoods is to actively  discourage pregnancies out of marriage, to impose strict discipline in the public schools,  including mandatory student uniforms, and to create a zero-tolerance policy for gun and  drug crimes, imposing harsh mandatory prison time on the offenders. 
[00:49:30]  And finally, challenging the entertainment industry to stop peddling garbage.  Hey, listen up, you greed heads.  If a kid can't speak proper English, uses the F word in every sentence, is disrespectful,  is disrespectful, is disrespectful in his or her manner, that child will never, never be  able to compete in the marketplace of America.  Never.  And it has nothing to do with slavery. 
[00:50:00]  It has everything to do with you Hollywood people and you derelict parents.  You're the ones hurting these vulnerable children.  You want a conversation?  You got it.  You want a better situation for blacks?  Give them a chance to revive their neighborhoods and culture.  Work with the good people to stop the bad people.  Pumping money into the chaos does little.  You can't legislate good parenting or responsible entertainment.  But you can fight against the madness with discipline, a firm message, and little tolerance 
[00:50:30]  for excuse-making.  It is now time for the African-American leadership, including President Obama, to stop the nonsense,  walk away from the world of victimization and grievance, and lead the way out of this mess.  Just walk away.  And that's a memo.  Damn.  It's too bad not one black person heard what Riley had to say.  Not one black person heard that.  He just said that to a wall. 
[00:51:00]  He's right about most of it.  Oh, it was great.  You can't agree with everything there.  You Hollywood people.  You kind of lost me on.  Really, Bill?  Yeah.  I like limousine liberal.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah, that's a good one.  I like how he says Jackson and Sharpton.  Jackson and Sharpton and his ilk.  I like it.  I like that.  Hey, you know what?  It's out there.  It's honest.  It's a little braver than most people.  Right, right, than most people.  You know, he wasn't tiptoeing around the fact of even saying black instead of African. 
[00:51:30]  I mean, you know.  And he's right about the family unit and stuff.  Absolutely.  When you get a 75% illegitimacy rate like that, it's going to cause problems.  And you see it in a lot of the younger black kids that are growing up without any type of male representation in the family.  A mother that doesn't do anything can't.  She's powerless to do anything as far as discipline goes.  Sorry.  I mean, we all like sitting here and thinking, oh, a family could be anything.  It could be the single mom.  It could be that. 
[00:52:00]  But when it's this institutional version of just fucking the single mom that does nothing, she collects welfare, she has no discipline over the child, they're going to run rampant.  And that's what we're seeing at this point.  We're seeing young teens running rampant in big cities.  And he's right about the, I'll say this about the entertainment industry, what makes me sick.  I don't think they cause the problems, but they do glorify it.  And what bothers me is I don't care if they glorify it, but then they come out and try to do public service announcements. 
[00:52:30]  Yeah, it doesn't work.  It's like, shut the fuck up.  Like, I don't mind movies like Two Guns.  I don't give a fuck.  I don't believe that makes people commit crimes.  But then don't come out and preach to me about how to speak or think or address issues.  That's where entertainment loses me is they try to be fucking preachy despite what they do to make money.  It's like, just do what you do to make money and go home and stop feeling guilty.  Collect your millions and shut the fuck up.  I don't think the entertainment industry should be blamed for anything like that.  But parents should be blamed for, or parent should be blamed for allowing their kid to listen to certain things. 
[00:53:00]  There's a parenting issue like there is with any movie that's a little too much for certain kids to watch.  And there's music that kids at that age probably shouldn't be influenced by that much.  But you have to have parents to even go down that road.  Right, exactly.  You need parents that are going to say no.  And when you're learning how to speak, and all you're getting it from is the entertainment industry, he's right. 
[00:53:30]  How are you going to compete when you've got people like fucking Rachel Jantel and the way she speaks trying to apply for a job?  If she sat down in front of your desk for a job interview, would you entertain the thought of hiring her for a second?  Honestly, it would depend on the Rachel Jantel you got.  If you got the one in court, because apparently she's got a decent GPA.  You might get a different version if you sat in front of her. 
[00:54:00]  I think she's got a decent GPA because they just fucking shoved these people through.  She's 19 and she's still in high school.  Yeah, she doesn't have a real GPA.  They pass, pass, pass them all right through.  She couldn't speak.  Doesn't she speak three languages, though?  Oh, please.  She speaks three languages because she was raised in a fucking household that spoke three languages. 
[00:54:30]  She didn't learn English and then go off to school and learn two other languages.  Learn French.  There's plenty of dummies that know two languages because there's two languages being spoken in the house.  She's delightful.  She's a tool.  She's a big, fat, dumb mess.  Here we go.  Here's Amanda in Nashville, Tennessee.  Amanda.  Yes, hi.  Hello.  Are you a black lady?  No, God, no.  White and proud. 
[00:55:00]  All right, wow.  So what do you got on the topic at hand?  Well, like yesterday, my husband and I are watching TV and they're showing these shows,  making fun of kids between three to 10-year-olds, black children, of course, humping each other  and dancing all over the place.  And you're like, okay, you guys are going to jump up and down about this race car thing.  Well, what are you doing about your children?  Why is it that black children are allowed to act like...  But isn't that good, clean fun as long as no semen is being spilled? 
[00:55:30]  Uh, not to the degree that I saw that, yeah, sure.  When you see fucking seven...  When you're at a certain age, yeah.  Seven- and eight-year-olds are grinding on each other.  Literally grinding on...  I've seen plenty of videos on, I guess, their show.  And then I guess some of the TV shows pick up and like, oh, look at this funny video.  Right.  And it's, you know, it's kids grinding on each other like they're fucking.  And when you talk to the parents about it, they're like, well, that's just a cultural thing.  That's just what we do.  That's the new cop-out. 
[00:56:00]  That's the new excuse.  It's like, and that's because too many white people have been saying like, well, this is a problem.  This is a problem.  And then you'll get the excuse of, you can't address this because this is our culture.  And you can't excuse it by calling it a culture.  Yes, Jimmy.  If you say something negative is cultural, you're called a racist.  Yes.  Or whatever.  But if you say something positive is cultural, that's acceptable.  That's acceptable and it's great.  If a white family let their children act that way, or Hispanic, they would be yanked out of the home in a second. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  If you let the black kids act that way, oh, that's just our cause, that's just our way.  Well, that's the reason why y'all are getting pregnant at 10 and 12 years old.  And that's why that most of these people who have no concern over anything other than what the world is going to give them.  You're like, no.  They're sexualizing them at a very early age.  And again, that just leads to more illegitimate children.  I don't know.  At least people are talking about it, but it's so hard to speak honestly. 
[00:57:00]  If you speak honestly, I challenge anybody to go on Twitter and speak openly and honestly and respectfully.  But you'll get a shitload of tweets about what a racist you are.  It's amazing.  It doesn't matter how respectful you are.  You're a piece of shit if you are any color.  If you're white, you're a racist and you're a piece of shit if you mention anything about any other race.  However, it's perfectly okay for them to dog everyone else in the world. 
[00:57:30]  No.  I hear you.  Control this shit.  All right, Amanda.  Thank you for your input.  All right.  You're in Nashville.  All right, then.  Thank you.  In Tennessee.  Let's say hi to John.  John, what's up?  Hi, John.  Hey, boys.  Yeah.  I was giving you a call with Pierce Morgan.  I think it was maybe last week.  You guys might have already discussed it.  He had on a black leader that actually took O'Reilly's standpoint.  Yeah, I saw that.  Owned him.  Fucking owned him. 
[00:58:00]  Owned who?  The black guy owned Pierce, man.  Just fucking Pierce was trying to say shit and this guy was just schooling him.  I forgot who it was.  Oh, there it is.  Yeah.  Larry Elder.  There he is.  What's his name?  Oh, Larry Elder.  Yeah, Larry Elder.  Well, Larry Elder.  Larry Elder did him up.  He lit up Pierce.  Really?  How long is this club?  I don't know.  She's stupid, Larry.  Two minutes.  To black people.  I think you're stupid for saying that kind of thing to try to get black people to convince  that race and racism can make a major problem in America when it doesn't. 
[00:58:30]  Do you think she's stupid, Larry?  Racism is not a major problem in America anymore, Pierce.  Racism is not a major problem in America anymore.  The number one problem facing black people are the large number of black people born outside  of wedlock.  75%.  In 1965, 5% of all people in this country were born outside of wedlock.  Fast forward, Pierce.  The number now is 43%.  You look at that for crime, dropouts, all that kind of stuff is connected.  The other big problem facing black America, Pierce, is the economy.  One in two black men does not have a job, and one of the heads of the Congressional Black  Caucus once said, if a white person were in the White House, we'd be marching on the 
[00:59:00]  place because of the high unemployment.  But we're talking about Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman as if it's the number one  problem facing black America.  It is remotely on the top ten list, Pierce.  Okay, Larry.  Larry, this isn't a sort of competition to see who can be the greatest filibuster in my  show's history.  I'm not trying to filibuster.  I'm just trying to make some common sense that I'm not hearing on your show.  Let me just get back to the question I asked you and see if you can actually answer the  question.  Do you think that Rachel Gentile is stupid?  I would say I think she's ignorant and uneducated. 
[00:59:30]  I think that I would rather have a George Zimmerman living in my neighborhood, and maybe if a George  Zimmerman were living in my neighborhood, we'd have a few fewer REO Castros.  I thought we wanted people to be proactive.  That wasn't the question, Larry.  I know I'm answering something different.  Could you pause for a second?  Just answer my question.  Pierce is baiting him and trying to get him to say Rachel Gentile is stupid.  And that would be the headline.  Oh, he says she's stupid.  The actual answer is she's uneducated.  She's ignorant.  So I can't tell if she's stupid.  Her lack of an education and her lack of an ability to articulate, it prevents me from 
[01:00:00]  judging whether she's stupid or not.  But who cares if she is or not?  Exactly.  It's such an irrelevant question.  It's an irrelevant question.  He's talking about problems in the black community and crime, and fucking Pierce is  Do you think this chick is stupid?  Who gives a fuck?  That is a dumbass question.  It's a non-point.  Yes.  This guy is getting into some real shit.  Right.  He's getting into the real issue.  And he just wants to soundbite.  Pierce wants to know if he's calling a girl stupid. 
[01:00:30]  She's stupid.  Who cares if she is?  Right.  She's fat.  She got me.  This guy's giving me good stuff here.  Yeah.  A little rap.  Sort of criminal.  He's not a criminal.  George Zimmerman shot dead an unarmed teenager.  He's a neighborhood watcher.  The one that was punching him in the face.  And there was crime in that neighborhood, Pierce.  I live in South Central.  There wasn't crime from Trayvon Martin in that neighborhood.  How do you know?  The burglar bars are not on there because of George Zimmerman.  They're on there because of the minority of thug in the community that's messing up everybody's 
[01:01:00]  image and reputation.  This is why people profile.  Instead of being angry at George Zimmerman, be angry at the minority of the thug who's committing  these kinds of crimes.  Okay.  If I could jump in again.  So just to clarify, though, Trayvon Martin wasn't committing crimes in that neighborhood,  was he?  It was an unfortunate incident.  Two people had preconceived.  No one wants to answer anything.  It never should have been happening.  It's pretty much over.  This is where Larry Elder and black guys like this irritate me.  Yeah.  And this is where Malcolm X would have fucking chewed his asshole out and spit in his face.  It comes to that point where it's like, it's more than an unfortunate incident. 
[01:01:30]  You've got to say, this was a tremendously bad fuck-up and blunder.  It was a terrible, and like with O'Reilly, I agree with him almost everything he said.  But stop saying racial profiling was not a part of it.  It was.  And I'm not saying that it is right or wrong, but just don't deny that it was there.  Of course that's why he was stopped.  If he was a fucking Chinese woman in that fucking outfit, Zimmerman never would have stopped him.  But do you think if it was a black guy in an Armani suit walking down the sidewalk that 
[01:02:00]  George Zimmerman would have stopped him?  No.  Exactly.  So it's not a race thing, is it?  They're both parts of it.  It's part of it, sure.  It's part of it.  So you get a black guy in a hoodie walking around.  When you look at close-circuit fucking security cameras from convenience stores, black guys  in hoodies are the majority of the people that are robbing those stores.  That's the uniform of the fucking robber. 
[01:02:30]  It's like the old-school fucking hood or fucking mask over the face.  So you profile it based on the fact that the clothing, but also, yes, that it's a young  black male in that clothing.  Like you said.  But it's not just racial profiling.  It's the whole picture.  He's profiling that person.  Everything about him.  Well, that's everything with profiling.  For instance, black guys in Armani suits don't get followed in stores either. 
[01:03:00]  You know what I mean?  There's always a clothing aspect to it, or normally there is.  I'm not saying every time.  So it's part of it.  You just say what it is.  It's like any type of profiling, there's usually another set besides skin color.  But if you give in and fucking say that race is part of the profile, it will turn into you  are racially profiling this gentleman.  But again, not giving in is the problem in these arguments.  Everybody is so stuck on their point and using this to segue into the next argument. 
[01:03:30]  Because they'll twist around what you're saying.  What they do with it is irrelevant to being truthful.  Let them try to twist it around.  If you're telling the truth, that's the problem.  People care about Trayvon Martin, but nobody really cares.  He's a talking point.  He's a fucking...  True.  Zimmerman is a point for people who are for the Second Amendment to...  Hey, look, stay here.  And the black thing is a talking point for black people.  Everybody uses this shit as just a talking point for their own fucking argument.  True.  Without listening to the other side at all. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, and if racial profiling is a part of it, I understand why.  Believe me.  Again, Fat Nick in Queens.  I was 100% with this guy.  And he racially profiled.  Let's go to Steve in New York.  Steve.  Yes.  Steve.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Hi, Steve.  Hey, Steve.  How are you, buddy?  I'm fine.  How are you guys?  All right.  I'd like to join in on this conversation again.  Look, racial profiling is an issue.  I mean, Jim is absolutely right. 
[01:04:30]  You know, if you really don't have an honest discussion about racial aces in this country,  you have to deal with it honestly.  What's wrong with racially profiling?  What's wrong with racially profiling somebody?  And I bring up the example that we went through the other day.  If you go into an ATM vestibule to go take some money out, and there's a couple of black  guys in there wearing hoodies, sitting on the fucking one of the windowsills, maybe drinking 
[01:05:00]  some fucking booze or something.  Would you take money out of that fucking ATM, or would you take money out from one where  maybe there isn't anybody, or there's well-dressed people, white or Hispanic or even black?  Wouldn't you profile those people for your own safety?  Well, frankly, Anthony, I would have the same negative reaction if I saw a white person or  white people congregating in front of a camp who were drinking, who were acting unruly. 
[01:05:30]  Would you have the same, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, sir, sir, let  me, let me ask you.  Would you have the same exact reservations about taking money out, or would you knowing that  most of the times if people are held up at an ATM vestibule, that it's by a young black  male, wouldn't you profile that a little more than you would white guys?  I would profile the conduct of the individuals. 
[01:06:00]  Well, then you're going to fucking get robbed at some point, because you're not thinking.  You're thinking emotionally and not fucking logically, then.  You're being dishonest.  Sir, you're being dishonest.  You're being, again, also paranoid about everyday circumstances.  I don't think I'm paranoid.  I walk around, I skip.  I have a skip in my step when I walk.  You're hiring, you're hiring, but all these other traits that you exclusively attribute 
[01:06:30]  to the black community, and quite frankly, those traits, negative traits, apply to just  about everyone.  You holler and yell about the...  At a far greater rate in the black community.  A far greater rate of violent crime in the black community.  Why am I supposed to not acknowledge that?  Why am I supposed to go through my life not acknowledging that and not taking certain precautions  to protect myself from that?  Why?  You can acknowledge it. 
[01:07:00]  You can take...  No, I can, apparently.  ...to improve it, but you don't negatively...  Fucking prove it.  I'm talking about saving my own ass.  That's all I care about, is walking through life and not getting fucked over.  So I look, I assess situations, I walk away from the danger, and I walk toward the safety.  That's it.  Why is it a problem?  You're overindulgent.  No, I'm not overindulging.  It is, but it's all overindulgent, and these kind of issues, quite frankly, is unhealthy.  It is for everybody. 
[01:07:30]  I mean, for you to constantly harp on this day after day after day after day without  offering positive, constructive solutions to it.  Positive, constructive...  I've been saying the same thing O'Reilly said for years.  Really?  How about black women stop fucking blasting kids out?  How about that?  How about white women stop blasting kids out?  I mean, you're talking about sexual...  There isn't a huge crime murder problem in the young white community. 
[01:08:00]  There isn't a giant murder problem in the young white community.  Stop it.  75% illegitimacy in the black community.  Stop it.  75% illegitimacy in the white community.  No, there isn't.  No, there isn't.  No, there isn't.  You're a liar.  You're lying now.  Now you're just lying.  Look up the facts.  Look up the facts, Anthony.  There'd be the illegitimacy in the white community.  75%.  75%.  You're lying. 
[01:08:30]  How does the overall rate go down to 45% when the black rate is 75%?  How do you factor that in?  Mathematically, it doesn't work.  Grab an abacus.  You fucking moron.  Look at this guy.  Anthony, you're the fucking moron.  Goodbye, racist.  Bye, racist.  Bye, racist.  You're a racist.  A dishonest, lying racist.  I'm done with you.  You know what I'm saying?  Shut up.  You're the racist.  You're the racist. 
[01:09:00]  You're the racist.  All right, let's go to Jackie on Long Island.  Jackie.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Jackie.  Hi.  When did Anthony become a racist?  I haven't listened in a while.  I just got a new call.  And I got a big chance.  And oh my God.  Last week.  Yeah, I didn't know this version of Anthony when we were at NUW.  I don't know.  Things have gotten worse.  What can I tell you?  I grew up listening to you guys always.  And I loved Anthony.  I thought he was the smartest guy on your show. 
[01:09:30]  And what's really pissing me off is that Jim is sitting there and you're sitting there  not saying anything to him.  Shut up, you coal burner!  By the way, by the way, miss, Anthony and I do debate this.  And I agree with some of what he says.  And I don't agree with some of the other stuff that he says.  I don't think he's totally wrong.  So when I feel Anthony is off on something, I get my opinion.  What are you talking about?  I speak openly and honest about race in many ways.  Some of it obviously comes off as racist.  Other comes off as, you know, I'm knowledgeable on certain things. 
[01:10:00]  But any time a white person addresses black issues and problems in the black community,  they will be dubbed a racist.  So you could call me a racist.  I honestly don't think I'm racist.  I mean, I have black friends.  I don't think I'm racist.  But people will see it that way.  People that don't want to really open their eyes and take a look around and notice that  there is a problem in the black community.  And any white person that addresses it is a racist.  Jackie, what's your thought on the whole thing? 
[01:10:30]  My, my, okay.  I think I have a little bit of racism in two.  I think we all do.  We were brought up like that.  But we try to keep it in check.  In check?  Like, why would you keep, like, knowledge in check?  Why would you keep an open dialogue about race in check?  That's been the problem.  Why not openly talk about it?  I do openly talk about it.  No, I don't think you do.  Talk about it as black people are bad and white people are good. 
[01:11:00]  If not, did I ever say that?  Holy shit.  Do you mean on the air or off the air?  Oh, okay.  I see.  See, and there is an element of humor here.  I do like to play around with the fact that, you know, I'm called a racist.  It's kind of a funny character to portray on air.  Do you understand a little bit?  Oh, it's a character.  A little bit.  Oh, all right.  Funny.  Yeah, the part where I'm tolerant. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  It's hilarious.  I've seen this character.  I've seen this character in the pool.  It's a great character.  Wow.  You're damn good.  This guy's a great character.  I'm a fucking method actor.  He's all in.  When is the movie going to stop being filmed?  Like Steve who calls.  I like Steve as a caller.  He calls in.  He's a regular listener.  I love Steve because he gets Anthony screaming by the end of it.  Oh, he does.  Always.  But you can't deny, like, you know, it's like when you're arguing emotionally, you can't  deny.  You're right about, like, if you go to a, part of it is clothing. 
[01:12:00]  If you go to an ATM, I wouldn't be scared if there was four black guys in suits joking  around the ATM.  No.  Four guys in hoodies in South Philly would make me nervous.  Reservations.  Yeah.  I mean, and it's okay to admit that.  It's not, you know.  Apparently it isn't, Jimmy.  Yeah.  It isn't okay to admit that.  But we're onto the hoodie.  So if I was a black guy and I wanted to do harm, I would go steal an Armani suit and  start doing my crime in an Armani suit.  Start doing it in a suit.  People would be like, oh, that's nice.  The only problem with the outfit argument with Trayvon is what would have been an outfit 
[01:12:30]  that was appropriate for the rain for him.  That's true.  Like, literally, it was a weather-appropriate outfit.  Yeah.  And the hoodie is something that athletes, it is something criminals wear, but a hood over  your face, like a stocking, is something only criminals wear.  Like, a hoodie is something that everybody wears.  Yeah.  So there has to be a different level of profiling with it, because if it's raining and someone  has a hoodie on, you know, his only other option was to wear a suit and carry an umbrella.  You could wear a Gorton's Gloucester fisherman hat. 
[01:13:00]  But I mean, what are the other options for him walking through the neighborhood in the rain?  I hear you.  Yeah.  All right, Jackie.  Thank you.  Oh, you're very welcome.  Rescue me.  Rescue me, please.  Help me.  Come on.  Help me.  All right, why don't we take our first break here?  Yes, sir.  Love this.  Well, okay.  We've got Nikki Glaser and Sarah Schaefer coming in.  Season two of their MTV show.  All right.  Yes.  They came in for the first season.  They were terrific ladies.  Seven-two dames.  We're having them back to do a little promotion, maybe get a couple laughs in. 
[01:13:30]  And we have to have, we have a good thing we didn't have any of their guests listed  on the prep sheet.  We do have the one guest.  Their first one was Kesha, which we had last year.  What?  No, the Kesha with the guest list.  Oh.  I looked up a nice guest list, but it's the same prep sheet as last year.  And we have to Ray Mancini, whose documentary was really good, man.  Boom, boom.  Really good.  Is coming in here today.  Very cool.  Yeah.  Looking forward to it.  Me too.  I'm actually, I've never met him.  That's the way you're ending it? 
[01:14:00]  All right.  No, no, no, no.  You're right.  E-Rock's right.  No, that was a little weird.  We almost ended it shitty.  We should, you know what?  We should, we should play the E-Rock song going into break.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  There you go.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  O.B. and Anthony.  On Sirius XM.  The guys are back from the toilet.  And now, back to our show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  What's this? 
[01:14:30]  Boogie Nights.  Food Party.  All right.  Okay. 
[01:15:00]  Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Got it.  46 years old today.  Oh.  I was just, uh, just watched him.  Oh, this.  Yeah.  This, uh.  Woo.  Dancing from Boogie Nights.  I gotta watch Boogie Nights again.  That scene is so funny where this is playing.  And they're at the disco.  And they start fucking doing that dance together.  I don't remember this song.  Oh, it's fucking great.  I remember the part.  What a great scene that was.  I wish my dad a very happy birthday. 
[01:15:30]  Look at that.  That's great.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, is it?  Yes.  Don Imus.  My dad.  Oh, that dad.  Yes.  Imus.  He's 73 today.  73 and all.  How great is that?  Hey, you got O'Reilly on the phone as we speak. 
[01:16:00]  Mr. Imus has Bill O'Reilly because people are talking about what Bill O'Reilly said.  Oh, yeah.  We just played it on our show.  It's a big story.  When they both come out.  I'll go back to that.  Fuck it.  Let's go back and forth.  Back to Boogie Nights.  Rewind to that part where he's dancing with the...  Roller girl?  Yeah.  Look at Luis Guzman in the back. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, Luis Guzman.  Just trying to get in a porno movie.  It's so ridiculous.  What a fucking great movie Boogie Nights is.  Don't you think John C. Reilly should be even more famous than he is?  He's fucking amazing.  He really is amazing.  We had him on once.  I'd like to have him back on.  Yeah.  I just watched Philip Seymour Hoffman in Twister again the other day. 
[01:17:00]  Stop watching.  I can't stop watching Twister.  Stop watching.  That is right.  Dude, I can't stop watching it.  It's that goofy.  It comes on and I'm just...  It angers me.  But I have to watch it.  I watched Philip Seymour Hoffman slamming down some drinks at a fine stage show.  Ah.  Yes, huh?  I think he finally had decided to maybe do a little something something about that, right?  Was he like Dusty? 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  The extreme.  He wasn't slamming, but he was certainly enjoying his cocktails at this particular drink a few months back.  It's going green.  Yeah.  Greenage.  Greenage.  Greenage.  Ew.  When did he say greenage?  He said that.  When the extreme was looking at the horizon, right?  I don't believe it.  The extreme.  And the extreme was looking at the horizon and Dusty came walking up to him and he goes, what  do you think?  And he's like, he's like, like all the instrumentation machinery and everything, you can throw that fucking shit out the window because the extreme just has to pick up a handful of dirt and smell it. 
[01:18:00]  And then let it run through his fingers in the wind and look around.  The weather talks to him.  So at one point he looks and he goes, it's turning green, which like kind of the light and everything kind of gets this green tinge to it.  And then when Philip Seymour Hoffman goes, yeah, greenage. 
[01:18:30]  I have goosebumps all over my body.  It's terrible.  I think I came in second.  I've seen the extreme in high gear.  You guys got to get some new stories.  I'm going to go clean up.  So, uh, we get this one near Delta.  We're way too close and Joe's got the fit on it.  She's filming it, right?  But all of a sudden, out of nowhere, this shitty looking green valiant comes pulling up right in the way. 
[01:19:00]  The extreme.  He starts yelling.  And this loser stumbles out of the car.  He's got like a bottle of Jack Daniels in his hand.  He's naked.  He is butt naked.  Naked.  He's naked, dude.  This is crazy.  He's not naked.  He's the extreme.  He's without the power.  Half naked.  Pause.  Naked.  Rewind.  Rewind ten seconds.  Oh, no.  I thought to be humorous,  somebody said  he was without apparel.  Yes, he did. 
[01:19:30]  I thought I heard that.  I know I must be mistaken.  The rabbit is good.  The rabbit is wise.  He is butt naked.  Naked.  Not naked.  He was not naked.  He's without apparel.  You don't like that, Jimmy?  It's literally...  Why?  That's fun.  I'm trying to go...  It's good stuff.  I'm going through my life. 
[01:20:00]  It could be the worst thing I've ever heard.  Ever, right?  Yeah.  Why, man?  That's good stuff.  You've got to find...  Other words for clothes.  Apparel.  Who would have thought that Cameron would be in something shitty enough that for a second  you could forget about Ferris Bueller.  Ferris Bueller.  That's how shitty it is.  Yes!  For a second.  It was a blockbuster, Sam Roberts.  That it was.  This was a big movie for him.  I don't know how this was a big movie.  It is so bad.  On every level.  It's already here.  Yeah.  We haven't done this break yet, right, E-Rock? 
[01:20:30]  E-Rock?  Like, we've never talked about Twister and played clips.  No, we definitely have.  Oh, Jimmy!  Yeah, so I had to...  You want to hear how obsessed I am with stupid Twister?  It was on ABC Family.  Right.  And I knew there were a couple of curse words, and I didn't want commercials.  Right.  So I just went to On Demand.  And I watched it On Demand.  You paid money to watch it? 
[01:21:00]  Well, like two bucks.  That's still...  Yeah.  Oh, it's down to a $2 movie?  Yeah, yeah.  This is real cheap.  But I...  You know why?  Because people were tweeting from watching it on ABC Family.  So I wanted to be involved in a little tweetage.  But I tweeted...  You wanted to be involved in a little what?  Greenage.  Where's Greenage?  I want to see that.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm not Greenage.  I want more Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Ah.  Greenage.  Well, you'll get some right here.  Joe's yelling at him to get out of the way, right? 
[01:21:30]  So he strolls up to the Twister and he says, have a drink.  And he chucks the bottle into the Twister and it never hits the ground.  Twister caught it and sucked it right up.  Honey, this is a tissue of lies.  See, there was another bill, an evil bill.  And I killed him.  Hey, look at him!  What are you yelling about?  Are you always yelling?  Why did he yell?  What did he just yell? 
[01:22:00]  Because he's extreme.  But what did he yell?  No, why did he yell that?  I don't know.  I would have said, what do you mean you killed Bill, douche?  Yeah, what does that even mean?  Shut up.  You didn't.  They all lick Bill's ass because he's the extreme.  Oh, is that his nickname?  Of course it is.  I've never watched this whole movie.  I've never watched the whole movie.  Let's have a viewing.  Come over to my house.  You watch it with me.  I'm afraid I won't get through it.  You probably wouldn't.  You'll get through it.  I'm afraid I'll carve my own skin on it.  You'll enjoy it. 
[01:22:30]  It's bad.  By the way, they're ruling out foul play in the rollercoaster death.  What do they think?  Chicken's got nothing to do with it.  That's an actual headline today.  Yeah.  They're ruling out foul play, which would mean that she was pushed off the rollercoaster.  What an elaborate plan someone would have to murder her.  Right.  I'll get her on the rollercoaster.  Well, thank God they're ruling out foul play.  Maybe they have to.  I don't know.  Who would think that would be?  Well, it shouldn't be a huge headline on all the news channels. 
[01:23:00]  I think we could assume that there was no foul play involved.  The operator of that fucking ride is going to be in some Dutch.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  For not making sure it clicked.  Yeah.  She even said, she goes, oh, yeah, it's not really clicking.  And he said, ah, it should be fine.  I guess it wasn't.  You never want to hear, it should be fine.  No.  I guess she came over the top of one thing, put her hands up.  Right.  And just flew right out of the fucking car.  She put her hands up to have fun?  Yeah.  Oh, the poor fat side. 
[01:23:30]  Exactly.  You're like, man.  Tragic.  Do you guys like roller coasters until recently?  Not really.  They scare me.  Oh, dude, I got to show you one.  One more one?  No, I'm just kidding.  I was reviewing the break from yesterday.  Oh, the break from yesterday.  You just scared me.  Oh, this is, they're playing the clip we were playing yesterday.  Yeah, we played that clip.  Of the two guys fucking enjoying themselves.  The two dorks.  They are a couple of geeks, aren't they?  What, are they roller coaster enthusiasts?  They have to ride every roller coaster in America? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, one of those.  I'd like to get him in studio.  He's the second highest grossing comic of the year last year.  Oh, then what you'll see in Vegas.  So if you come out, let's see, on Thursday, we're going to be in Westbury.  He's a band builder.  At the theater at Westbury.  Yeah, that's great.  And then we're going to be at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark.  Yeah, he started on America's Got Talent.  And now he's making just ridiculous money in Vegas.  What the fuck is his name?  I always forget his name.  Something Fader.  I don't remember Fader.  Manicholoquist acts.  Yeah, he's a beast.  He's brilliant, though, Ant.  It's unbelievable how good he is. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  Oh, he's ridiculous.  He's got a little crash test dummy dummy.  Trouble yourself separating what's you.  A little turtle.  He is a little turtle, too.  Look, it's moving its head.  Oh, it's a turtle.  I would, yeah.  He's doing an interview, and he's got the turtle, like, looking at him.  I thought he had Jim Norton on his lap.  Oh, Jimmy.  She loves puns.  Yes, she does.  That's true.  Very true.  What do you tell you?  You have a night job?  I mean, would you?  I would say something like, what, are they going to make turtle soup out of me or something? 
[01:25:00]  That's a good one, Chip.  I'll be a fucking great ventriloquist.  Let's see a little of his...  Girlfriend broke up with me.  Did she say why?  She said I was moving too fast.  I'm going to dedicate this song to her.  I thought that I was over you.  That's her, he fader.  Yeah.  But it's true, so true.  I love you even more than I did.  He's singing without his lips moving. 
[01:25:30]  He's very good.  I'm starting.  What can I do?  Well, you don't.  It's not funny, though.  It's...  No, it's...  The hop is laughing.  Oh, it's a guy who was on that show.  Remember the hop?  Oh, fuck, yeah.  No one's laughing.  It's a good ventriloquism, though.  I think they take clips from other parts of the show.  Of course they do.  I bet they have, like, a really good comic come out beforehand, 
[01:26:00]  and they just get crowd shots of the crowd laughing.  No, they couldn't have a really good comic come out.  They say...  Here's what happens.  An audience coordinator comes out there and says,  Okay, everybody, give me a laugh!  And they...  And they laugh and film.  Really?  Believe me, I won't allow that at my shows,  but they try to do it in British.  Oh, no.  Pierce was on this, too.  No, this doesn't work on the radio.  No, but he is a good ventriloquist.  What you just heard, a man's lips weren't moving.  There you go.  Yes.  I don't know. 
[01:26:30]  I'll take fucking Otto and George over that guy.  Of course.  In a second.  Yes.  How's he doing?  He's good.  He's really good.  There's a benefit for him July 28th.  I forgot to mention it.  In Parsippany, I think.  Yeah.  I should Twitter the info.  It's to help Otto,  because he lost a lot of money.  Gambling.  Yes, gambling.  But he didn't work for a couple of months  because he had meningitis.  Wow.  So we're lucky Otto is okay,  and you should support this benefit.  Bob Levy is a part of it,  and I fucking wish I had the information in front of me,  but it's my fault I don't. 
[01:27:00]  But July 28th, I think, in Parsippany,  we'll get you more information.  Absolutely.  Bob Levy sent me a couple of song parodies, I guess.  Did you get them?  No, you just spoken about them.  Yeah.  I guess they were done to get Beatles songs, you know.  Who did them?  I don't know, but him.  Oh, Bobby.  It must be him singing.  The singing is terrible.  Of course it is.  And there's a point where singing could be bad on song parodies. 
[01:27:30]  I understand.  It kind of makes it funnier.  But it's just really bad singing.  But he sent them to you.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  So there must be some kind of value to it, no?  Well, I guess.  There's one, like, one Howard one, I guess,  about Howard only working three days a week.  And then there's a Jimmy one.  Done to eight days a week?  Yeah.  Exactly.  Ooh.  Is there anywhere we could get them?  They send you the files? 
[01:28:00]  Are they on YouTube?  Why don't you send me files?  You got files.  I got files.  Let's hear them.  You got files.  Do you want?  I got the information, by the way,  just to plug while you're looking for the files,  the Comedy Shop.  It's on Route 46 Eastern Parsippany,  July 28th at 8 o'clock.  Voss is going to be there.  Bonnie is going to be there.  Of course, Bobby Levy is hosting.  It's going to be a great show.  You go to jjcomedy.com.  It's a great comedy show,  and it really is helping out  one of the funniest guys in the fucking world.  But it doesn't have to call me JJ. 
[01:28:30]  We got the info on our Facebook page.  Opie and Anthony on Facebook.  Thank you, E-Rod.  Let her pee.  Let her pee.  That's...  All right, then.  Let me see if I could forward...  I'm going to forward this...  Forward it to me.  I'll just play it right off of here.  To you.  You'd play it?  If you guys want to hear it.  I need your...  It's...  Uh-oh.  You want to do that?  Oh, man.  Oh, right, right.  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Ah.  Ah. 
[01:29:00]  F-A-G.  Oh, oh, oh.  Is it the Gmail?  Gmail.  Okay, I got you right there.  I'm filling you.  Everybody knows it.  Now send.  Of course they do.  All right, I'm sending.  Look, it's sending.  Ooh.  Sending.  People like this.  Working.  Working.  I'm not on the network here.  I'm just on LTV, so it's going to take a little while.  But, yeah, he did that, and then he did letter P, which I guess is to let it be. 
[01:29:30]  I didn't listen to that one yet.  It has to be.  Yeah, I would hope so.  Of course it is.  It has to be.  Yeah.  Let her pay.  What other Beatles songs are going to be?  I think it's sent.  Okay.  They always take a while, don't they?  Shouldn't this be instantaneous?  Don't you get annoyed when email is an instant instantaneous?  And when you really think about it, it's quite the selfish little greedy thing to want it.  I thought about what a fucking rushing idiot I am when I was on Grubhub.com and I'm ordering sushi.  And you have to keep going up and say number of pieces and then style, sushi or sushi. 
[01:30:00]  And I'm like, God damn it, I've got to push this extra button.  And I'm like, you in a hurry, cunt.  You really are.  Like, Jesus Christ.  I really had annoyed at myself.  It means it's a dope.  Yeah.  I'll send you the other one, too.  What do you want to hear?  Do you want to hear letter P?  Well, yeah, I think I might.  You do, Opie?  Sure, why not?  Anthony, do you want to hear letter P?  Do I?  Yeah.  That's a yes, I guess.  I have a feeling that the guy that does the E-Rock songs is involved. 
[01:30:30]  Yes.  Because I might have got a direct message from Sean F.  So he might be singing on this.  He was involved musically or something.  Oh, but he's not.  It can't be him singing.  I do think.  I don't think Sean F knows.  Does he know music?  He specializes more in E-Rock information.  Yes.  That's his specialty.  That's what I was getting at.  That's what I was getting at.  The other one just got sent, too.  All right.  Yeah, let's hear one of these.  All right.  Let's start with one.  Now we have to.  Letter P is what we'll start with.  All right. 
[01:31:00]  This is Bob Levy.  Yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  It's nice.  Love this song.  Yeah.  When I find myself real bored at night, a thought always comes to me.  I want to be pissed on.  Letter P.  And even through the darkness, she is standing right on top of me, filling my chest with your 
[01:31:30]  ring.  Letter P.  This is going great.  Letter P.  Letter P.  Oh, let her tinkle fall on me.  I will clean up in the morning.  Letter P.  A little shoehorn there.  Okay.  And whether it's a man or a woman, it doesn't really matter to me. 
[01:32:00]  Let there be some flowing, please God know.  Be more funny.  Letter P.  Letter P.  Boo!  Letter P.  Well, no shit.  There will be some flowing on little Jimmy.  Letter P.  Letter P.  Huh?  Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  What the hell?  Uh-oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  What the hell?  Letter P.  O-N-G.  Filled my chest with urine all over me. 
[01:32:30]  So, isn't this great?  There you go.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  I'll say the lyrics are very good, but Bob's voice is a bit lacking.  You see, that's what I was  Did he say urine?  Yeah, he did say urine  Hey, olives  The writing is very good  Some urine on me  Yeah, yeah 
[01:33:00]  Alright  That was the voice  Do you want to do three days a week?  More Howard shit  It is  Could be good though  The vocals are so bad  His singing is so distractingly bad  Like 
[01:33:30]  You know this song  Oh no, he's not going to be able to keep up with this song  Now that I got paid  Now I can say fuck you  I'm a fucking greedy Jew  Now you know it's true  Pay me, replay me  Pay me, replay me 
[01:34:00]  I don't have to really work anymore  So here's  Three days a week  Loved you a long time ago  But that's all behind  Always on vacation  And sue it all the time  Yeah  Pay me, replay me  Pay me, replay me  I don't give a fuck about you 
[01:34:30]  Now  So here's  Three days a week  Three days a week  Chorus  I laugh at you  I laugh at you  Three days a week  Because I am a greedy Jew  I used to need my fans  And I bet you know it's true  He just moaned  I feel so fucking protected  I feel so fucking protected now 
[01:35:00]  Because my security is five foot two  Oh  What?  Pay me  Replay me  Pay me  Replay me  I ain't got a reason to work now  So here's  Three days a week  Three days a week  That's fucking weak  Yeah  And if you're not there on Fridays  You are doing a disservice to the audience  And you're not doing your job 
[01:35:30]  You're not doing it right  That's like  That's like someone going to work  And doing a half-assed job  I guess he has a beef with Howard  I guess so  Apparently  He was  Going back and forth with him  Or maybe just  Fourth with him on Twitter all weekend  Fourth  There's no back and forth  It's just fourth  It's just fourth  Yeah  What's the matter, Jimmy?  Nothing  Oh, I thought  There was a problem with your blueberries  No, no, no  The blueberries are fine  Oh, goody  What's up?  Do we have  Nikki Glaser  And Sarah Schaefer  Are they here yet? 
[01:36:00]  Not a day to be late, gals  How about we get some intel?  What?  How about we get some intel?  Are they here yet?  If not, we'll do a quick break  But I mean  They can't bump into  Ray Boom Boom Mancini time  We got a break anyway, I think  I gotta go pay  Yeah  I'll take a piss  You know what I like to do  It's gonna hold each other's cocks  Fuck yeah  Even if we don't have to pay  Right  One, two, three, four  Tell me that you love me more  Sleepless long nights 
[01:36:30]  That was what my youth was for  Oh, teenage hopes arrive at your door  Left you with nothing but they want some more  Oh, oh, oh  You're changing your heart  Oh, oh, oh  You know who you are  The O.P. and Anthony Show  On Sirius XM  Sirius XM  The O.P. and Anthony Show 
[01:37:00]  We'll talk about that later  That was funny  That was so true  Let's say hi to Nikki Glaser and Sarah Schaefer  Coming into the studio  A couple of beautiful girls  Very beautiful girls  Hi ladies  Hello  Hey guys  Looking good  Look at that  The ladies are looking good  Two hours of hair and makeup for this, guys  Really?  Yeah  For radio  Why?  I know, right?  I don't know 
[01:37:30]  Are you doing TV today?  They're hitting you in the bathroom  At like four  At four  It's gonna  Man  Yeah, you're ready for TV  I know, we are  You guys are ready for TV  I remember when they came here last time  It was right at the beginning of this whole ride  And now they just look like success  Yeah  Get the makeup on  It's amazing what makeup can do  Thank you  We have changed  You're all changed  Congrats on season two  Thank you  MTV is seeing something in you guys  Yeah  Very cool  Yeah, I think so  How are you guys doing? 
[01:38:00]  I haven't seen the show  But I hear it's actually doing pretty well  Yeah, it's good  We're doing  We're coming back on the 30th  So we're just in pre-production right now  We did a rehearsal show last night  That went well  Yeah  What do you do with the rehearsal show?  It never sees the light of day?  What if there was something in there that was really good?  We'll put it in the next week  That's what you should do  Yeah, yeah  So we treat it like a real show  And then we watch it and say  You know  We gotta use that  Yeah  Nice  So we did  We had a whole audience there 
[01:38:30]  And they were so disappointed  When they realized that  That it was not an actual show  Not a real show  Why like  You could just feel the disappointment  But it was caped, right?  It was  Yeah  But why would you tell them  It's not a real show?  Because all the clips  That we would like throw to  That are going to be in our first episode  They're not  We haven't even shot them yet  They're not there yet  So we'll be like  So look at this  And then they're  Guys, we don't really have that yet  And we have no guests today either  Oh man  Just deal with it  Yeah  They were okay  Or they wanted a celebrity guest  They didn't get one  They need that 
[01:39:00]  They need that  We are not  We don't count  There's a few people in the audience  That you can tell are fans  Yeah  But it's mostly just random people  Where do you get the audience from?  A lot of it's casted, I think  Yeah, well  I think they put out like  There's people who sign up  To go to be in audiences and stuff  Yeah  There's people that do that  That's hilarious  It's like a thing they do  They just like  Oh, I'm going to be an audience member  Yeah  To them  They feel like they've been selected  You know  Yeah  For something  My family used to send away for tickets 
[01:39:30]  For Phil Donahue  And Montel Williams  For tickets  Send a self-addressed stamp  And Sally  Yeah  Sally  Raphael  Sally Jesse  Oh yeah  Oh yeah  We would send away  And you know  It would be a nice trip to New York City for us  Oh boy  Yeah  That is a white trash weekend  So if I was a little younger  I would probably be in your audience  Getting some free entertainment  Well are they good crowds though  I did something for the Sklar Brothers  It was like online  Some MTV award  And I presented 
[01:40:00]  And we joked around  And the crowd was actually  Better than I thought they'd be  It's not like my audience at all  Right  Yeah  I'm off by 25 years  And I'm just  I'm an older creep  But they would  We feel that way too though  Do you?  They're really young  They're young  Yeah  But they're good  They're good  We have Artie Fuqua  Warm him up  Perfect  So it's  Yeah right  It's great  The warm up guy  And he's probably banging four at a time  Like a shish kebab  I saw him walk out with four of them last night  Oh shit  He really did  Artie's perfect for that  It's like you catch a glimpse of him 
[01:40:30]  You know  We're back getting ready in the control room  Whatever  And you look up and see him  And I'm like  Is he dry humping someone in the audience?  Oh shit  Yeah Artie's a fucking animal  But  Gets him real warm  But they like him  He's weirdly likable  And love him  Oh love him  I love the guy  Yeah  So funny  He beats people up while he smiles  Yeah  No boundaries that guy  No you can't beat that  I love it  Are you guys getting more recognized  Now that you've done the first season?  No  No  I have not been  She's been recognized  I've been recognized like twice 
[01:41:00]  Twice?  You're on MTV  I know  Zero times for me  I think if we paraded around in a mall  In like Oklahoma City  We might get recognized  Yeah  I think in New York people  I definitely have noticed people  Looking at me  Like while I'm eating  Uh huh  Yeah  I've been like  I think they might know who I am  They're trying to figure it out  They're trying to figure it out  I know her from somewhere  We do get a lot  I think we both get like  MTV  I've never gotten that  If we're Nikki or Sarah  Or if that's even the show 
[01:41:30]  Yeah  It's  Probably together too  You'd be recognized  Yeah  Yeah  We went to a Taylor Swift concert  And we got recognized there  Yeah  But that was just like  We were in with our own  Did you get to see Taylor backstage?  We did  Oh you did?  Yeah  She like had heard of our show  And invited us  Really?  Yeah  We met her  And it was  Was she stunning?  She was  So nice  So stunning  So tiny  And so tiny  Is she tall?  Yes  And skinny right?  So skinny  She's such a 
[01:42:00]  I really liked her  She's very normal  Is she beautiful?  She's very  She was  We love her  I like sincerely  Answering you  I know  I love her  She was beautiful  She put on such  A sparkly show  Didn't she?  It was so good  I'll be honest  Mean is a good song  Because you're mean  I like that song  Do you?  I do  I do too  It's a tremendous performance  She's got catchy songs  Let's all be honest  She's a fucking  Toad tapper  And she wrote that  We are never getting back together  Ever  Ever  She wrote the most annoying song 
[01:42:30]  On purpose  That she knew  Would be so catchy  Because she wanted  Jake Gyllenhaal  To hear it  Over and over  And over  He hated pop music  And he was a music snob  Wait was he the one she dated?  Yeah  One of many  Yeah  What's her problem with men  You think?  I think  I think she's young  And doing what young girls do  But she's in the spotlight  So  She probably gets bored fast too  She probably gets bored with these guys  I think she's very conservative  I think she gets clingy fast  Really?  Clingy 
[01:43:00]  You think clingy?  Oh yeah  And what then the guys just go  Oh does she get dumped?  Yeah  I think that's  I don't know  It's hard to tell  Yeah she's gotta get dumped  For writing  Because she writes the songs  About getting dumped  Yeah she writes the songs  That are angry  I think she gets dumped  I think that what happened  With John Mayer  Is like he  They  That was the first time  She had like good sex  Oh man  It was maybe like her first  Yeah John Mayer  Great orgasm  And she got attached  First time getting her hair pulled probably  Oh man  She was like  What are these feelings I'm feeling 
[01:43:30]  You think John has a big piece too?  Absolutely  He has a fucking  He has a Mount Rushmore head  He has to have a  John Mayer's all cock  Yeah we think he has a big piece  He's all cock  100% cock  That's how he's getting the gals  That's why he's a big head  He's cock and head  That's all fucking Mayer is  Guaranteed  He's fucking packing eight  It's probably eight and a half  And really like embarrassingly fast  Like he's probably have to explain  When he takes his dick out  Like look  It's not bruised  This is actually my dick  Thanks  Because he picked off 
[01:44:00]  The hottest ones man  It's not bruised  Oh my god  He's fucking Mayer's my hero  Yeah if you're in the  Taylor Swift category  And  Katy Perry  Katy Perry  And stuff like that  You're fast  There's a whole bunch of them  He's just making his way  Through that whole scene  Absolutely  He's actually just  Jennifer Aniston  That was a throwaway  And she was like  Heartbroken by it  I mean  That means he's got a big cock  She's heartbroken by everybody  I know  She just can't hold a guy  She didn't marry now  We think she has a smelly pussy  That's why she can't hold a guy 
[01:44:30]  Really?  Well we have to tell the ladies  Don't we?  Of course  Yeah  That's our theory  That's your story  My personal theory  Because why wouldn't she have a guy?  She wants a guy really bad  But she can't get a guy  And you look like that  And she's still looking good  In her 40s  Huh?  She looks so clean  Smelly pussy  I'm going  But there wouldn't be a way  To fix that  If you were so rich  For you to think  If you had like a pH balance  Yeah whatever it's called  I'm talking about the one  Where it's  A problem problem  Like halitosis  Get a pool guy 
[01:45:00]  You got a little too much alkaline  Down here  Yeah we're going to put some  Some acid in the pool  You know there's a guy out there  Going well actually  I could figure it out for her  Figure it out  You got a little piece of litmus paper  And dip it in there  Yeah I'm seeing a little  Acidicism  Yeah it's a bit green  It's a bit green  Oh wow  Sorry ladies  But that's my theory on that one  I kind of like it  We have two theories  John Mayer has a huge cock  And Jennifer Aniston  Has a smelly pussy 
[01:45:30]  Yeah  Our theories  We have theories  Those are our theories  Wait they might have theories  You never know  Yeah you've met  Most of these people  You got theories on anything  Celebrity theories  Celebrity on anyone  On anyone  Oh I don't know on anyone  Jennifer Aniston  I mean I think she's just  She's too intimidating  Bitch on wheels  Bitch on wheels  No  Bitch on wheels  I know that was  That was like  That's old school  That really is old school  When I was a kid  When I was a kid  It was like  She's a bitch on wheels  You can get bent 
[01:46:00]  You got that one  From the roller rink  Yeah yeah  Bitch on wheels  We've had some good guests though  Fucking you got  Jessica Alba  And how was she  Yeah  Was she pretty  She was so pretty  She tall  She's skinny  She's really pretty  She's very nice  And she got  We played  We were kind of  Being weird  And gross  And like  Had some  Yeah  She played along 
[01:46:30]  With our game  Oh that's nice  Kind of  What do you do  You do a straight interview  Or do you fuck around  With them or both  We start with a straight interview  And then we kind of like  Trail off  Into some sort of game  What game did you play  With her  Oh she had a book  Book out  It was like  Called The Honest Life  And it was about  Like making face scrubs  Out of coffee grounds  And stuff like that  And you know  Doing everything natural  Yeah  And so we  We came up with  Alternate 
[01:47:00]  Uses for things  Oh  Natural products  And they were like  Kind of insulting things  I don't even remember  What they were  One was like  Framing your grandma  Framing your grandma  For something  Coke possession  Or something  Using  Baking powder  All regular products  Like a funny prank  Did she appreciate  That you were kind of  Mocking her other work  I could tell at first  It probably  Yeah  She got on board  By the end of it  But then she knew  She had no choice  Yeah  In front of an audience  Yeah it's embarrassing  When they fucking  You can't back out  Yeah  Oh man 
[01:47:30]  Well a book like that  Our audience is you know  Young mostly women  Yeah  I mean I think  They're vaguely interested  In stuff like that  But they're not worried  About cloth diapers  At that age  No  Did she say cloth diapers  That's part of the book  She's got  Doesn't she have a whole line  Of things that are like that  Like  I think she does  She's washing her diapers  Oh my god  Who wants to reuse diapers  Fuck trees  Just grow one  And kill it  And make diapers  I'll have to  They don't make diapers  Out of trees  I'm an idiot 
[01:48:00]  There's paper in there  Oh it is  Okay  I'll have to wash out  A onesie every once in a while  But I'm not gonna wash out diapers  Your own  Well  There's been a couple problems  Over the years  A couple racing stripes  That I was embarrassed about  Got to get in there  And wash it out  Before you throw it  To the hamper  I don't want anyone  Seeing that  Yeah I can't imagine  People washing out  Diapers  You know some people do  Our parents did  A new trendy thing  Is to just train your kid 
[01:48:30]  To pee and poo  With no diapers  Because the theory is  Most children in the world  Do not have diapers  They're just  They learn  The parent and the child  Learn to recognize  When the child has to go  And then they hold it  Like in India  They like hold it over  Are you kidding?  So the kid goes like  A little infant  In India  But they lean outside  Of their fucking  Their garbage house  And hold it over a child  Falls on your head  And add it to the duty pile 
[01:49:00]  Outside the window  People in like Park Slope  Are like  There's little groups forming  They're trying to teach  Their kid how to  How to  Piss him  Because apparently  It's not natural  To mess yourself  Oh they think  It's healthier to not  Yeah it's not natural  It's a taught behavior  To crap your own pants  Is it a hipster thing  Or is it a funny  Yeah it's like a hippie  Hipster funny  I didn't hear  When they were first born  But a lot of people  Potty train their kids 
[01:49:30]  By making them go around  The house naked  Finally  Yes that is part of  But they're older  At that point  I can't imagine  A baby over a toy  Yeah  I hear in China  They just let their kids  Shit anywhere  Well if it's a boy  If it's a girl  They kill her  Right right  Right right  Those hippies  What a great culture  Over there  With that whole thing  Wow  They had to put up signs  At the Louvre  That say  Only in Chinese  Do  Like no defecating  Outside 
[01:50:00]  On the street  But it's only  In Chinese  In Chinese  Yeah  They shit outside  They just shit  They just shit anywhere  Like toddlers  Yeah  It's a thing  Wow  Fuck  And then like  The Chinese government  Had to issue  A statement  To the whole country  Being like  Hey you're embarrassing us  In France  And other places  What are you doing  You're shitting outside  On the fucking sidewalk  You have to  I love Asians  I love that here  Yeah  I would love to see  A Chinaman  Taking a dump  I would love that  Now I want to see that  They work 18 hours a day 
[01:50:30]  They fucking smoke  I'd love to see  Just a guy smoking Chinese  Just shitting outside the Louvre  How great would that  Those people  How great would that be to see  Right next to that  Big glass pyramid  Yeah exactly  Hey you're your snobs  Enjoy your art show  Maybe his own  Mugnark masterpiece  Exactly  I'm fucking  I'm a fucking cook  In a restaurant down the street  I'm dropping a deuce  Mind your beeswax  Good for him  Wow I respect that  What do you guys think  About the royal baby  Being born  Yeah  I'm excited  Yeah 
[01:51:00]  Thank you  That should be the answer  Yeah  I mean I grew up  Like worshipping  Princess Di  Because I was a little girl  And I was like  Princesses are real  Oh  And so I still have  Some warm feelings  Towards the royal family  Yeah  I shouldn't  You still think like that  It's totally stupid  Part of that  Early childhood thing  Yeah  But I like a little bit  Of glamour  And wonder  And  Well somebody raised  A point of a special  Today  Like what do they do  But someone said like  They wind up bringing  In billions in tourism 
[01:51:30]  I mean they really do  Make a lot of money  For England probably  What else are you  Going to England for  You stand up in front  Of that palace  And take some pictures  Yeah  Queen's in there  What else is there  She's not even in there  She's her own castle  I can't wait to start  Judging her  On when she's gonna  Lose that baby weight  Yeah  Oh yeah  This week  All the tabloids  Especially over there  Terrible people  Over there  Yeah  With the tabloids  They'll be like  Oh  When is she going  To drop this baby weight  Oh  It looks like  William's looking 
[01:52:00]  Elsewhere  And they'll have  A picture of him  Like he just  Turned his head  For a split second  It looks like  He's gawking  At some fucking girl  He's just like  Traveling the palace  Yeah  He just heard  A loud horn  Or something  And he took a picture  And it's like  He's cheating  Yeah  He's cheating  I hope she balloons up  I hope she gets up  To like 350  And she won't lose  Oh would that be great  I wish that for every  Oh  Big fat princess  How great would that be  Stuck with her  The giant fucking  Oh that would be great 
[01:52:30]  Oh how humiliating  Big fat princess  She's not a princess though right  She's like a fucking  What is she  She's a duchess  She's a duchess  Duchess  What's the difference  I don't know  What their dumb titles are  Stop already  I would love to date Pippa  Just to like  How embarrassed  The royal family would be  Like once my CD's surfaced  Like  And in 2004  He said  And it would be  A  Asterisk  Asterisk  Eating  Like that would be  You don't think 
[01:53:00]  The queen mum  Would like you  They'd be so encouraging  Her to  They'd be assassinated  They'd be so encouraging  They'd be taken out somewhere  They're hiding Pippa though  Put him in the tower  She's not around as much  As she used to be  I don't know  She's dating some fucking guy  Some guy out there  Who belongs with her  Like a guy who plays tennis a lot  He's a banker  You know  He's just repugnant  Plays polo  Boring  He's probably in much better shape  Than I am  But I guarantee  English guys do not eat pussy properly  They don't  They really don't 
[01:53:30]  Wait why do you know  What is that  Because they just  They don't love the vagina  I'm not saying they're gay  I'm not saying they don't have sex  But they don't  They don't really  Worship a vagina  With their mouth  Yeah  They don't  Is that really an American thing  Yeah I've dated a couple of British girls  They're dirtbags  And I say that with affection  I don't mean that to knock at all  In a very loving way  Yeah  But they're  Really  They're very  A, B, and C  I used to date this one British girl  And this is true  I lived in New Jersey  But I drove a Saturn  So she used to like me  To park my Saturn 
[01:54:00]  And she would  Want me to bite her  And she just kept saying  I want you to bite me  I want you to bite me  She got into this  Almost like fucking mantra  That's the first person she met  With teeth  Take that  It's funny  Yeah she couldn't have an orgasm  Without fluoride  Being rubbed  On her clearest  Nikki and Sarah live  On MTV  Yes  It's funny  I'm promoting a show  On MTV  And just being complete creeps  Yes we are  What are you guys on?

Well it's  Long story short  I was looking at 
[01:56:00]  I clicked on it  It was the same name  As a girl I grew up with  And I was like  What's she doing in Brooklyn?  Because I was like  Organizing people  On my Facebook  You know  Real important work  Yes  Putting in a good day  Yeah  And I was like  What was she doing?  And I was like  Oh that's not her  And then it said  Like this person has  45 friends  44 of which  Are your mutual friends  Oh that's weird  And I was like  That's weird  This whole girl's existence  Is aligning with mine 
[01:56:30]  And then I looked at  The list of friends  The only thing they had  In common was me  And weren't people  That it was like  This person from my work  And then this person from  Wow  That's creepy  So I figured it out  And it was like  A chill down my spine  Like oh he's been looking at  I mean  Did you call him on it?

[01:58:00]  You're listening  To Opie and Anthony  Sirius XM  Sirius XM  XM  This  Is the Opie and Anthony show  There he is  Ray Boom Boom Mancini  In studio  Is this like  No longer like a year ago or two  No  Was that never on the show  No never on the show  No man  We would remember 
[01:58:30]  Ray Boom Boom Mancini  Take a seat sir  How are you sir  Good  Very good  Thank you  You look like you  You could still fight  I can give you four good ones  I can't see that  Four good ones  I can give you four  I can give you four rounder  But after that  No shot  Yeah  The first thing to go  Is it the cardio  No  Oh well  I'm on  I didn't realize  You're on  We do that all the time  No  No  This isn't so much the cardio  I think it's the desire  Oh really  Once you lose the desire 
[01:59:00]  You know  It's like  People said  How did you know  It was time to retire  I said  Well  Here's the difference  When I was fighting  The reporters  You say  Boom boom we  You hear  You're getting up  In the morning  When it's blizzard snow  Pouring rain  Trenching rain  You're out there  Doing road work  And I said  Yeah  And they said  Why  I said  Because I know  The other guy ain't  And if he is  He better be  Here's when you know  It's time to retire  I get up praying for rain  It's raining  Jump back in  You're looking for the excuse  Is the desire  Like  90% of it 
[01:59:30]  Absolutely  It's a mindset  Absolutely  You hear it all the time  But it truly is  Look  I got talent  You got talent  You can fight  It's about  Who's got that  It's a mindset  That you can take it  To a different level  But for me  Especially my style  Fighting was not made  For a long career  I had to be in top shape  I'm going to keep  Coming  Taking punches  To give punches  That's a certain mindset  You have to have  If you don't have  The desire  Determination  Willing to pay the dues  To go through that  Then you  That's what I said  Then you got to  Shut it down  And that's what I said 
[02:00:00]  When I lost  The love for the game  And  I  I lost the love for the game  Actually before I retired  Because since after that fight  I lost the love for the game  But  You know  I had the title  A chance to  Hold on to get my security  Fighting for a couple years  And I fought  Still as hard as I could  And  Still beating guys  Knocking guys out  Things like that  But  After  After the second fight  With Bramble  I just had no love for it  No more  And I didn't do it  In that fight  I was going to be  My last fight  And  Time to shut it down man  I mean  The one thing I'm most proud of  I only fought five and a half years 
[02:00:30]  As a pro  Not a long fight  I had 34 fights  34 fights in five and a half years  That's a lot of fights  But the one thing I'm most proud of  Is I can still spell fight  Yeah  And I say to have joke  Because so many guys can't  So many guys  Right  You only fought for five and a half  That's it  Yeah  That's incredible to me  I was fighting in 1985  Wow  And how old were you  When you retired  I was 24  You were 24 when you retired  When you retired from boxing  You knew at 24  Now you would think  That's at the top of your game  But again  Yeah  I was  You know 
[02:01:00]  I always said  I never became the fighter  I wanted to become  Until the end of my career  But I had already lost  The love for the game  You know  I had already lost the love  That early though  You would think  That might happen  Wait  You couldn't sit around  For a year  And find the love again  For those paydays  Well  It's the difference  My style  I said  If I had a style  That's you know  A boxer  You know  I wasn't  Right  But my style  Was like I said  A fan friendly style  You come forward  Get in there  And swing  And duke it out  Yeah  It's going to be  You know  You're going to make a score  For a couple years  You're going to  You know  People expect a certain 
[02:01:30]  You know  When I  People expect a certain style  When they knew I was fighting  They knew what I was going to give them  And once you ain't willing  To give them that  No more  You're only  You're cheating the fans  As well as yourself  Yeah  Hey Ray  Let me ask you this  Were a lot of people shocked  When you retired at 24 though  I think so  I think  Some guy said  You should probably retire  Before that  Oh shit  It's like a guy said to me  He said  When did you retire  I said  You know  August of 85  I was 24  He said  I thought you retired  Two fights before that  I think so 
[02:02:00]  I think  People don't realize  That I was so young  But what I do appreciate  Is that  Because I was fighting  So regularly  A lot of people  Remember my fights  And they think  That I fought longer  Yeah  I fought longer  And you also  Obviously  Hopefully you save money  And everything  Yeah  I was very fortunate  I came out of a good  And like I said  That's one chapter of my life  And I knew that  I mean  That's not my life  Boxing wasn't my life  It was one chapter of my life  There was other things  I wanted to do  And I knew that early on  So what did you do  From 24 to today 
[02:02:30]  Well you know  I went in  I got into the  Entertainment business  I've been represented  By William Morse  At the time  And they offered me  Acting gigs  You know  And I never was able  To take advantage  Then I went  And auditioned  For a movie  Not long after  The second Bramble fight  And I said  Man the camera  Don't punch back  Well actually  Before the second Bramble fight  The camera don't punch back  The worst thing that happens  Was take two  I said man  Why didn't I do this earlier  You know  And that's when  I really said  Okay  And he just said  You gotta be where it's at  So of course  As they say  If you're gonna go fishing  You gotta go to the water 
[02:03:00]  So I moved to LA  And I've been out there  For 28 years  And I'm enjoying it  You know  I'm not where I'm gonna be  Not where I wanna be  But I've been fortunate  To work to film  TV  Stage  But I'm mainly now  Concentrate on producing  To me that's the juice  To me taking something  From nothing  Taking it through fruition  Seeing it up on screen  That's the juice for me  And the documentary  I saw is great  It's called  The Good Son  And it's your story  And it's ultra  Video on demand  On July 16th  And it's in theaters  August 9th 
[02:03:30]  And it's really great  I mean  He sounds like Bob Gullib  I don't know if he's a comedian  Bob he's a good friend of mine  Oh you know Bob  Bob he's from Sharon PA  Right over the border  I did Bob he's podcast  That long ago  Oh jeez  Oh Bob he's a good friend  For years  It's all I thought of  Watching the documentary  Is how him and Gollum  It's the same fucking  Bob he's going to the right  But that's  Hey man  I had somebody  Some fights  What's his excuse  Exactly  Nothing  Nothing  Bob is a psychopath though  Bob Gullib  Is a fucking psychopath  But it's that part of the country  Is a very tough 
[02:04:00]  Like Sharon Pennsylvania  Youngstown  Is a very very  Fucking tough part  What makes it so tough  You think  Well blue collar town  We were sick  A lot of blue collar towns  But  Sycamus is still producing city  But you know  It's a blue collar  It's still mill town  You know  You get what you give  You know  And we're the city  Youngstown  We're the only city  Of our size  Anywhere in the country  I mean there might be others  I don't know of any  That's controlled by  Two major mob families  It hasn't been forever  Pittsburgh and Cleveland  So forever  When you grow up  In that atmosphere  Which that's part of life 
[02:04:30]  Everyday life  And you know  Guys  People  Are still workers  And when  Mills shut down  And people got meaner  You know  It's not like they advocate  Go to New York  Being an actor  Or be a singer  Or be a DJ  Or a radio host  Or anything like that  It was you know  Get married  Go to work in the mill  Get married  Raise a family  And that was great  Solid  Solid earth people  Best people I know  I just knew  I wanted something different  And I said  I can't do that man  I watched my father  Go to the sweat factory 
[02:05:00]  I used to get up  You know  He'd get me up in the morning  Before school  I'd do road work  He'd give me a kiss  Walk out the door  Walk to  We lift two houses  From the corner  Blizzard snow  Pouring rain  I look at it  I go  Oh god  I can't do that  I gotta make it  As a fighter  I can't do that  Eddie O'Neal  Ed O'Neal  From Modern Family  From Youngstown  Eddie's a dear friend  From Youngstown  We talk about it all the time  And Eddie said  He became an actor  Because  It's a funny story  He was  You know  Pittsburgh Steelers  He was in their  Training camp  1970  He made it to the last  Cut 
[02:05:30]  As a linebacker  And he said  He always says  It was the day that  Or was that 69  It was the day that  Neil Armstrong  The day he got cut  Was the day Neil Armstrong  Walked on the moon  He said  Good day for him  Not such a good day for me  He said  But  He went back to Youngstown  He started working at a bar  That he had frequented  His whole life  And he looked around  And he saw everybody  They were there for  Guys that were lifers there  You know  30, 40 years  He said  That's going to become me  I can't do it  Yeah  So he borrowed some money  He said  I'm going to New York  And try to be an actor  I mean that's  That's 
[02:06:00]  He's in the documentary too  He talks a lot  And Mickey Rourke's in the documentary  Yeah Mickey's great  Mickey's great  And Ray Leonard  So I can't very much  I appreciate these guys doing it  Mickey  I love Mickey  And the fact that he agreed to do it  And Eddie of course  And Ray did it  I mean  It's special  It's very special  And your dad was a fighter too  There's so much I didn't know about you  My father was a much better fighter than I was  My father was a great fighter in the 30s and 40s  He was a great fighter at the time  A lot of great fighters  And because of World War 2  Didn't get the opportunity to fight for the world title 
[02:06:30]  He signed the fight for the world title  A month before he signed the fight for it  He was drafted in the World War 2  And he said  Look  I mean  I want to defend my country  I just want the opportunity to fight for the title  And he said  In fact  I'll give my entire purse to the Army Relief Fund  Which at that time was crying for money  They said  No man  We don't want your money  We want you  And consequently  He never got a chance to fight for the title  And all I heard about growing up  Was how my father should have been  Could have been  Would have been world champion  Because he already beat  Sammy  And my father never talked bad 
[02:07:00]  He was very proud  To defend his country  It was one of the greatest things  He said he ever did  He said  But he always  He never talked about regrets  But once in a while  He said  You know Raymond  He said  If I only had the chance  I would have won that  Oh wow  And you could see  He never talked bad about it  Just we could see how it bothered him  But since I was a little boy  When I used to hear those stories  People would say  What do you want to be when you grow up  I say  I want to be a fighting world champion  For my father  And that's all I ever wanted  And he's the one  Who never wanted me to fight  He's the one who tried  To talk me out of it  In the worst way  Especially when I was in high school 
[02:07:30]  And we were going to turn pro  I said  Dad I want to turn pro  He said  Raymond  It was depression  I had to eat  I had to fight  You have so many other opportunities  Because athletic as well  It's academic scholarship  To go to college  I had a professional baseball offer  I had other opportunities  He said  I had to fight  I said  I want to win the title  I want to win it for you  And I'm just fortunate  And blessed  To live out my dream  You know  And people  I used to have reporters  I used to say  Well boom boom  If you didn't make it as a fighter  What would you have done  I said  I can't answer that  Because that's all I ever wanted 
[02:08:00]  I never  I can't answer it  There's nothing else I ever wanted  So  You know  I said  Look  I moved to New York  I wouldn't have went back home  I would have been the best  Bust out waiter there was  In New York  But I wasn't going home  Unless I was successful  And I meant that  Well you had a brother  Your brother Lenny  And he was also  A very good fighter  Yeah  Much better fighter than me  He was a much better fighter  Guys  People  You know  I said in the documentary  In the gym  I'm going to tell you  Guys who saw him fight  Better fighter  Hit harder  Better boxer  Slicker  But my brother  He loved the streets 
[02:08:30]  And you know  My brother was a street guy  And you know  Better fighter than I was  But as I said  In the documentary  The one thing he  He lacked  That I had  Was discipline  My brother was a handsome son of a gun  And the women loved him  And he loved the party  And you know  But when he trained  He trained hard  But it was in between  You know  People don't understand  It's in between fights  In between tournaments  That you got to live  A righteous lifestyle  And Lenny was partying too much  And he worked in the steel mills  When the steel mills shut down  He was looking for things  And he got caught up  With the wise guys 
[02:09:00]  And he was collecting  And that foolishness  And I'd say  Lenny  Man come on  Come with me  Be with me  He said  There was times  He was tapped out  Didn't have money  He was a divorced father  Paying child support  You know  His ex-wife  Wouldn't let him see the child  Oh boy  I said Lenny  I'll give you money  I'll give you some payment  You're my younger brother  I'm supposed to take care of you  Man don't worry about it  You know  You're my brother  And  You know  You try to talk to him  You see where he's going 
[02:09:30]  You see where he's headed  You know  And nothing ever good  Comes out of that  Growing up  Knowing those guys  And growing up  You know  He just said  Man  I wanted something different  And if he would have just  So I held on for a little longer  He would have been with me  When I hit  Right after that  Things started happening for me  You know  Right  Right  You know  God gives  God takes  God took Lenny  But he gave me  The opportunity after that  And  If he would have held on  He would have been with me  In my training camp  And he would have  We had a great time together  And your brother passed away 
[02:10:00]  Because of  I guess the lifestyle  Yeah  In the documentary  You address it  And  It was very interesting  Because there were some  Some facts around that  That were a little bit  Yeah  Dicey  Yeah there was  And  And the detectives  They said  Look Raymond  We can get into  We can go into this  And  Do you really want us to  I said no  Don't bring him back  And I don't want to put my parents through that  I don't want to put them through it  Don't bring him back  Who cares  He's God  That's the bottom line  You know  I knew  I knew the general facts  I didn't need to know the particulars 
[02:10:30]  And  You know  And you got to move on from that  And that's the thing  I'll tell you  After we buried him  A couple days  The day after we buried him  I came back to New York  And that was the hardest thing in my life  Man  Leaving my parents  You know  My father broke down on my arms  My father never cried  That's why  I never saw my father cry as a kid  My father said  The last time he cried  When he was 10 years old  He said  When his father left  You know  To go to  Left  And my grandmother split  He said  You stay here  And take care of your mother  I got to go  And he wanted to go with his father  And  He said  Raymond  I cried so much 
[02:11:00]  That dad could never cry again  And I never saw him  And I think a lot of boys  Don't see their father cry  Sure  But that day  He broke down in my arms  Like a child  He was just wailing  And I said  Man I ain't gotta go  Dad  No  You gotta get on with your life  You gotta get on  You gotta leave  You gotta leave  And  I think at that moment  I mean that's  To me  Those are the moments  You remember  How I got to the title  You know  Those are moments like that  You have to overcome  To get on  To get in that car  To go to Pittsburgh  To get on the plane  Man that was the hardest thing 
[02:11:30]  In my life  How did you keep the discipline  With that  I'm sure you were offered  You know  That type of lifestyle  Yourself  And it seemed  At the time  Especially as young as you were  It probably seemed like  An easy way to  Make a few bucks  What's the difference there  You see it  Again  You see it early on  You see guys  They weren't  Fathers who were  Who wasn't  You know  I'd be sitting there  When I was fighting  They were all proud of me  They never  They were very proud of me  I bet  Sure  And we'd go out  After a fight  Back in town  I'd be sitting here  The DJ  From the radio station  Would be here 
[02:12:00]  The city official  Would be there  The guy  Was a major  Major  Major guy  Would be sitting here  All having a drink  Because in Youngstown  How we looked at it  Everyone's carrying  The lunch bell  To their job  Just different jobs  Right  It's a lifestyle  Man  It's a grind  Everyone has to make a living  That's just how  They made their living  So one thing  That had nothing to do  With the other  Your life  My life  We didn't conflict  With each other  Right  Good neighbor  My neighbor  Was the fact  That people were proud of you 
[02:12:30]  And you knew that  Did that want to keep you  From getting into  A bad lifestyle  But again  I said I was disciplined  That never intrigued me  That lifestyle never intrigued me  I knew  I was intrigued  Reading about  El Capone  Lucky Luciano  Because they were like  Modern day cowboys  And being of Sicilian heritage  Right  And I knew my grandfather  When he came from Sicily  That's the life he got into  Because he had to make a living  But that's not the lifestyle  I wanted  I wanted other things  And like I said  They were proud of me  They come to all my fights 
[02:13:00]  All the glitterati  All the glitterati  Would sit at ringside  Everybody wanted a flash  And that was great  But they supported me  It was good  Youngstown was a great city man  It still is  Sounds wild  Jesus  In the 70s  In the 80s  It was like the wild west  Yeah  A lot of comfort  Between two families  But Youngstown's a great city  Wouldn't want to grow up  Any other place man  It was a great  Great place to grow up  Is it still corrupt?  Maybe you don't want to  Answer that actually  No no 
[02:13:30]  Obviously  The people are still there  But there's nothing  To fight over now  The steamer was shut down  There's nothing  I mean  I go back home  And I ask friends  Who is and who isn't  Isn't Raymond  There's nothing here  Yeah  You know what I mean  Yeah  The guys are still around  Most of them died  But they're still around  But there's nothing  To fight over  There's nothing going on  So you know  Yeah  So I mean  It's not as prevalent  As it once was  But yeah  Of course  It's still  Presence is still there  Right  Gotcha  And you focus 
[02:14:00]  A good piece of the documentary  Because I mean  After all these years  I know you're so  Not sick of it  But you've covered  Dooku Kim  And you know  You've discussed it enough  But I was impressed  That you dedicate a piece  Of the documentary  Because a guy who  Okay  Yeah  He died in the ring  But that just becomes  A footnote  Or an anecdote  That people tell  But it's like  You really show him  As a person  And you get into his  Family  And his trainers  And you make him  A real  And relatable person  Which was  I thought  Really great  That you did that 
[02:14:30]  I thought  Well first of all  When Mark Kriegel  Did the book  He said  Look man  This is a book  About your life  That's one part  Of your life  You're going to have to go there  He said  I'm going to have to go  Every dark place  You don't want to go  The death of your brother  The death of Kim  Your divorce  He said  I'm going to have to go  But he said  You got no say  So when I write  You know  But you got to trust me  If you want the best story  About fathers and sons  I'm your guy  And I know what type of writer  I was  And I trust him  And he's an artist man  I love Mark  We're connected  I don't want to connect  At the hip forever  Though I want to choke him  Sometimes  Did he write down  Anything that you got annoyed at  Probably  When we were on the book 
[02:15:00]  Oh yeah  He's a pain in the ass man  But I love him  You know what I mean  But he's a pain in the ass  And so  But I wouldn't want anybody  I couldn't ask for a better writer  I wouldn't want nobody else to write  He was still a guy  You know  But  You know  So when you  But he'd say  That's one fact  I'm not  I'm going to talk about your life  Your grandfather  Come from Sicily  And he said  Look  It's a father  About fathers and sons  You and your father  Your father  With his father  When he came from Sicily  You and your children  And ultimately  Me and my father  He said  I want to become a writer 
[02:15:30]  Because my father was an English major  But  So he uses  Other than me and my father  I think the city of Youngstown  Has as big  Or as important a character  In the book  As anybody  And that's what I think  Jesse James Miller  The director of the film  Who was also  One of the artists  You know  Did with the film  He made the town relevant  He made it as much  As a character  As anybody else  And again  With the documentary  People talk about  The Kim  Incident  Meeting the  The fiance  And the son of Kim  But it's a 90 minute doc 
[02:16:00]  And we don't get into  I don't meet him  Until 60 minutes into it  So it's an hour  About me growing up  In Youngstown  Sure  My family  I want to be a fighter  For my father  Then we get into that  So I think  It was so well done  Tastefully done  And edited  By Jesse  By Jesse  And his crew  That you're right  That is an important part  And that is the way  They handled it  And you know  The day they told me  That G-Wan  Wanted to meet me  I mean  That was his son  Kim  Yeah  Absolutely  And the fiance  Young me  G-Wan  Wanted to meet me  And Mark  Treagle said 
[02:16:30]  Do you have a problem  With that  I said no  I think it was important  I wanted to have  I wanted to meet him  I wanted him to have  Some closure  And for me  It would put closure  Some closure to me  Because I always wondered  About the boy  And the fiance  And that day  That we met  And so  You know  We're setting it up  To camera  And they're telling me  I'm sitting around  In the stoop of my home  And they're telling me  And he's on his way  I told Mark  I said Mark  You better sit up  Do you want  Because you got one shot  I can't do this again  Right  I can't go through this  They can be no  Cut take two  No  Got one shot 
[02:17:00]  You better get what you get  And it did  It was really well done  And do you feel like  It's all reporters talk about  And do you feel like  It unfairly defined your career  I don't say unfairly  I understood it  But like I said  I like to think  I'm known for much more than that  I understand  It's always best known  I'm best known for winning  The world title  Defending it four times  You know  Fighting to win the title  For my father  Fighting for the honor  Of my city of Youngstown  I like to think  There's a lot more things  I like to think 
[02:17:30]  I had a pretty good career  Absolutely  But I understand  Don't get me wrong  I understand  But that fight's  Got to stand out  It's just such an odd thing too  Because I mean  Obviously there are tragedies  In every sport  You know  You can look at auto racing  And what not  It just seems  Boxing is so much more personal  It's on a personal  Level  That people are  I guess more fascinated by it  In some  Like macabre way  I think because it goes back  To the old gladiator days  Exactly  But you have to understand  And part of it is because  At the time  I was like  You know  I was 
[02:18:00]  As Irving Ruth said  I was the all American boy  Want to touch a mozzarella  You know  This was prime  Irving Ruth said  This was prime time  Saturday afternoon  Yeah  I was a big  You know  A ratings guy  For CBS  I was on network television  So I had a great fan base  Boom  But here's what people are saying  Nobody knew until after a fight  And the thing is  The unfortunate part is  Other than the ending of the fight  It was a great fight  Yeah  It was a great  We want to fight  You see on ESPN Classic  All the time  But because of that 
[02:18:30]  There's nothing good about it  Right  And so  So I understand now  Like I said  At the time  At our time  Yeah  But I understand now  I wasn't down at the time  How did you remedy that  With yourself  Well  I rely on my faith  I have a strong conviction  In my relationship with God  You know  Being growing up  At a Catholic high school  Parochial school  Twelve years  You learn  To have that relationship  And that's the only thing  That got me through  And it's the only thing  That carries me through my life  Today  Through any hard time  And  I say my prayers 
[02:19:00]  Every morning  Every night  And I leave it in God's hands  You know  I'm not trying to get  The philosophical thing  But that's  No  My faith carries me through  Exactly  Do you want to ask something  I want to  Just let the people know  That he helps sex fighters too  I think that should be said  Yeah  You got an organization  Yeah  I'm part of the  Boxers  The Retired Boxers Association  And it's great  And my friend Alex Ramos  From the Bronx here  Started it  Years ago  And we try to help fighters  And I'm part of  Also Ring 8 
[02:19:30]  And Ring 10  Right  Which are here in New York  Based in New York  And these are guys that do  Businessmen that put the money  Into a pot  And help fighters  That's  I'm very proud to be part of  A lot of fighters have  Horrible lives  When these guys go out  Yeah  During the holidays  They have money  To make sure  To take care of these guys  If they have  Doctor bills  That take care of these guys  So Ring 8  And Ring 10  Is a wonderful  Wonderful organizations  They are wonderful organizations  And if anybody  Here knows of it  Or wants to be part of it  It should be part of it 
[02:20:00]  Because they have monthly meetings  And great ex-fighters  And people  Part of the business  Come and talk  On a monthly basis  And I'll be there  September 10  For Ring 10  And I'm actually  I'm so looking forward to it  It's been a while  Since I've been back  But it's just  We don't  We have to look out for our own  Because we don't have  Any unions  We don't have  There's no union boxing  So  We have to look out  For each other  And you know  Basically  Whatever you made in fighting  You're going to have to  Parlay that into  Something else  And he sustains you 
[02:20:30]  For a lifetime  You said something  Very interesting too  In the fight  You're talking about  The Kim fight  You said  I in that moment  Know him better  Than his fiance  Or his kids  Or anybody who knows him  What is that relationship  When you're fighting a guy  You guys are sharing  Some weird thing  That no one else  Around them can understand  I'm glad you brought that up  Because people say  What is it when you're in there  With another guy  I said  I may have  Never met this guy before  Never seen him again  But for those moments  I know him better than anybody  Because you know  What's that deep in his soul  Because you know  It's an animalistic nature 
[02:21:00]  Of the business  I know  We both know  What we're trying to accomplish  I have something  He wants it  I'm trying to keep  From getting it  That whole thing  And how you go about it  So that's why you always  See fighters hug after fight  You know  May have to be at war  But you hug after war  Because you have such  A mutual respect  And admiration for each other  And what we're trying to accomplish  And you know  And then you go  Your separate ways  How much can you tell  Before the fight  Right before the fight  By looking  At a man's face 
[02:21:30]  How much can you tell  About his fear  His ambition to beat you  Well some guys you could  And the other guys you look  And you know  You know it's going to be a headache  And it's just  I mean  The fight with Kim  I used to  His dressing room  Was right next to mine  And sometimes they're not  But sometimes they are  And before that  You could hear him  And when I'm under  You know I like a little  Piece of quiet  We're sitting there  And I'm kind of meditating  And all of a sudden  You're  Bang, bang  He's punching the walls  Punching lockers  Oh no  And all of a sudden  When my team looks  And we start to get  Real wide eyed  I go  Oh man  We're in for a tough one 
[02:22:00]  Today aren't we  And that's just  But I knew  What I was up against  You know  I had the mindset  You know  I prepared for war  My style was not  Coming forward  Like I said  It was going to be a war  But I prepared for war  You got to go  You know  I used to say things like  You're going to have to  Kill me to beat me  For this time  You feel that way  As a fighter  I'm willing to die  For my title  You mean that  But subconsciously  Obviously  You don't want that  I would fight to the end  If I have to  And I would  But you say things like that  And then you realize 
[02:22:30]  After something like that  Happens  You really got to watch  What you say  Sometimes people can will  What they say  Right  Right  Yeah  I mean  Here's what people  Don't understand  Which you'll find out  In the documentary too  Is that  Before the fight  He had a  And his trainer  Talks about it  And his  His sparring partner  Talks about it  He had a coffin  Next to his bed  And they said  What's that  He said  Either I'm coming home  In that  Or Mancini's going home  In that  Holy shit  And you go  And my daughter said to me  She said  Poppy  Did you know that  I said  No man 
[02:23:00]  Good thing I didn't  Wow  Because that would have changed  If I'd have known that  I don't know if I would have  Got a ring  You know what I mean  If you'd have thought  Like that  But I know  That  Their mindset  You know  He had that  That warrior mentality  I know what it is  To have that mentality  But  I never thought  Like that  You know  Right  That's the  You just want to win  I'll do whatever it takes  To win  You know  That type of thing  Yeah  Yeah  And  And it's scary  After you think about it now  And then he wrote on  The lampshade  Kill or be killed  The day before the fight  Wow  It's after  It's very eerie 
[02:23:30]  After the fact  It is  Yeah  They are telling us  That Ray has to leave  Oh man  Why  You got another interview  You probably have other interviews  I thought I was  Auditioning for a show here man  Please  We can talk to you  Till 10 o'clock  This is fucking great  I don't want you to leave at all  Yeah  The documentary  Is The Good Son  It's excellent  I've seen it  It's obviously  Ray's story  And it's  Ultra Video On Demand  July 16th  Or you can see it in the theater  If you want

[02:43:00]  But I just remember  The nightmare  Of not being able  To stop that  Oh boy  Did I want to  Fucking open that  Door and give a kick  Watch her fucking  And it still took you  How many years  To get out of it?  Nine  That's crazy  It's crazy  The first couple hours  Were good  Yeah  But didn't you have  Tears in your eyes  Night one?  Tears in his eyes  I guess  As he looks at this marriage  That's why I said 
[02:43:30]  First couple hours  Oh  Oh you're right  I said couple hours  Yeah  Like the first dance  Was nice  Yeah  You know  First cocktail maybe  Yeah  Enjoyed the celebration  Nice things were said  By relatives  That's great  Got married in a place  That later became  A strip club  Wonderful  Oh god  Her scream  That time  I had to drive  Her and a  Fucking mother  From the club  That was  I want to go home  But Judy was like  I want to go home  And I'm like  I can't 
[02:44:00]  I have the truck  I have the band's truck  We have to load  The equipment in it  I want to go home  My mother wants to go home  Now  Motherfucker  I'm like  Joe  Look  I'm going to take  The truck  From Boston  Drive it back  To Ashland  How far was that  Almost an hour  It was like  45 minutes  And drop them off  And then I'll come back  With the truck  And we'll load  The fucking  Equipment back in  Well  I hadn't been up there  I hadn't lived up there 
[02:44:30]  At that point  It was  We were just up there  For a gig  And I didn't know  My way around  Or anything  There was no GPS  Right  I was going off  Of the fact  That I thought  Judy might be able  To let us know  Which way  To go  She was being a brat  She was drunk  Off her ass  Her and  Her daughter  Were sitting  In one of the  Bench  It was  Yeah  Bench seat  So they were sitting there  And I was driving  It's like a rider truck  You know  And  And I'm like  Where  Which way 
[02:45:00]  Which way  Where are we  Where are we  I don't know  Where we are  I don't live in this area  I don't live here  Oh fuck  My whole fucking band  Is waiting  Back at the club  I have to load  Equipment  Which way do we go  I think  Are we in  Framingham  I need to  I don't know  Where are we going  Are we going 
[02:45:30]  And she didn't even know  Where we were going  I fucking  At one point  I got so mad  I jammed on the brakes  And they both ended up  In the fucking footwell  It gave me  An ounce of pleasure  Finally  After probably  An hour and a half  An hour and 45 minutes  We get there  To the house  How'd you get there  It was like  Almost like a miracle  Right  She popped her head up  For a second  And went  Oh it's over there 
[02:46:00]  She knew the bar  Or the restaurant  On the corner  Of course  And  So I fucking  Dropped  Them off  And at that point  I had to drive back  To the club  Try to figure out  Where that was  No cell phone  There's no cell phones  I couldn't even call  My brother  They thought I was dead  They literally thought  Because my brother's like  There's no way  Anthony wouldn't come back  With the truck  So he must be dead  It was terrible  The club was closed  So  And it was cold out  So they had to take 
[02:46:30]  All the equipment out  In back of the club  And stand there with it  For over an hour  While I was on my way back  Because they wanted to go home  And I got back  And Joe's like  What the  And I went  No  No  Don't  No  Not right now  I go  If you want to bitch at me  About this  Tomorrow  Feel free  But right now  I swear to you  I will fucking kill something  Where are we?  How annoyed were you?  Where  Are we? 
[02:47:00]  I wanted  To choke her  With her daughter  I just was so  She wouldn't have just  Angered  How long would it have taken  To load the truck  While those two selfish bitches waited?  Fucking  Half hour  So why didn't they just  Go at most?  You  Take  It was more out of  I just wanted to leave  Out of embarrassment  Oh was it  Your wife was being a cunt?  Oh they were both  Both of them  Making a scene  A scene  While you  After a gig

[02:48:00]  You're out of that though  Like you didn't have a kid  I couldn't even  Yes  I never  Stuck with her  Ever need to see her again  If we had a kid  I would be fucking  Like having a  Deal with that shit  Look at her dumb fucking face  Oh  Wow  Do you think she would have been nicer  If she didn't drink?

[02:53:30]  But there was  Three shows  They had to watch  Every single night  After we did this  General Hospital  Days of Our Lives  And then Friends  Was it Friends?  Yeah of course  It was Friends  And then we would  Watch that  Anthony why are you  Drinking so much  Captain Morgan  We would get  To live  We would get back  To the house  At 730  Because we were  Doing afternoons  And if you were  Lucky you got out  Of there by 10  10 it was usually  11  It was usually 11  Did you want to  Watch those shows though?  No  Night after night 
[02:54:00]  After night  It was this crazy  Routine  I'd go down  And socialize a little bit  Like alright  See you later  And pop out  Or take off  Do whatever  Why do you just  Go to the bar?  Why does  Stephanos and  Mira have such  A problem with  John Black?  Well the problem  Was that his  Ex didn't drive  Yeah  So he was  Stuck with that  License  Worthless  I think when  She had a  I think she  Tried to drive  A car once  In Comac  And she got  Like 50 feet  And it went 
[02:54:30]  Right into a tree  And she  Did not  Drive  It was in the zoo  She hit a tree  She told me  She bit the horn  So she was crazy  About driving  So she didn't drive  Unless you're brought up  In New York City  You gotta learn  How to drive  And Judy  Can't drive  Off the dock  I don't like  Driving off the dock  Cause I can't  See very well  And I have to  Make right  On tunes  Cause as you know  I don't make  Left on tunes  Three rights  Make a left  All true 
[02:55:00]  Oh god  All fucking true  She couldn't drive us  To Logan Airport  Dude  When I finally  Remember when we  Finally started  Getting a line  On where things were  We couldn't believe  How close everything was  Like we had to go  From like Judy's house  To the mall  In Framingham  Or something  No it was for the bus stop  To go to Logan  Cause she wouldn't drive  So all the way to Logan  Cause that's like  Driving cross country  To her  Crazy  So we did  All these country roads  And a lot of rights  And it's not lying  Right 
[02:55:30]  Cause she didn't want  To take the left  So it would just  Take us  Completely out of the way  And then you know  When we finally  Started figuring out  Our own bearings  We're like  Do you realize  She lives five miles  From the bus stop  For Logan  There was a time  I remember  It took us an hour  Sam  I'm not joking  It took us an hour  An hour  Cause no left turns  And it was  Five minutes away  There was one time  Maybe ten minutes  You know  So we don't exaggerate  But it was really close  Dude I went to the mall once  And I remember  Coming back  To Judy's house  My jaw was

[02:57:30]  It's crazy  I'm sorry E-Rog  E-Rog  It's not you  It's the concept  It's your character  It's the listener's concept  Of E-Rog  It's your character  No it's your portrayal  Of E-Rog  That's true  My portrayal of the concept  Of an E-Rog  Why is E-Rog so ornery?  Why are you ornery  In the last couple days?  I get disappointed when people see you  Because then they realize  You're not fat  So do they  Sorry E-Rog  That was a wordplay joke  See that doesn't help  E-Rog  E-Rog  Why are you a little ornery? 
[02:58:00]  You alright?  Everything good with you?  Alright  Seems a little ornery-ness  It does right?  You know what?  I'm very psyched about this  Montreal trip  Me too  Why?  We're not even going to see you  You're going to be in a casino  The whole time  No no no no no  I'm going to spend some time  With the staff?  Hanging out  Really?  Because we don't hang out  And like really  True that  This is a trip  We're  You know  The staff is going on  We should fucking hang  I agree  Yeah  And we got a  I just  One of our comedian friends  Who we were having difficulty  Getting booked  Texted me back 
[02:58:30]  Like yeah it's the first  I've heard of it  Sure I'd love to  Oh my god  I'll tell you off air  Just because  I don't want to put him  In an uncomfortable position  With his representation  Wait what are you talking about?  Wait could you write it down?  Sure sure sure  He's very funny  And I like him a lot  Nah we don't need that  Oh he's going to be great  Yeah I think so too  Oh  He's really funny  Do you know him?  Yeah I do  He's a very funny comic  I think he's going to  Be really good  He'll be alright  Yeah  He's a good act  And he's a good dude 
[02:59:00]  But it's amazing how like  The publicists and stuff  Don't go  He's like it's the first  I've heard of it  Like they don't  If my publicist  If I found out my publicist  Or my manager  Turn down something  On my behalf  Without telling me  I would behead them  Oh  Jesus  Bringing that here  To this country  Jesus  He'll behead  Jimmy's going to  Bring it to this country  The beheading  But you know what  Oh my god  You literally  How about a good scolding  If you have no reason  Are you going to start  Are you going to start 
[02:59:30]  With a beheading Jim?  Wow  Perhaps that's incorrect  Or a little chit chat first  How about your browbeat  A little bit  It drives me nuts  That these  The publicists operate that way  Yeah  Like you know  Because I was getting annoyed at him  And I'm like wait a minute  He's my buddy  He wouldn't  He would at least go  Hey I would love to  But I can't  But he goes  Hey at first I've heard of it  And that's just  Amazing  It's how they are  What does this have to do  With Judy though?  Oh nothing  Oh okay  I just thought of it  People love the Judy stories 
[03:00:00]  And I try to remember  Like ones we haven't told  I know  I know  I know there's more  I bet you Jay  Who's listening now in LA  Could probably  Remind us of a couple  But I know there's more  I blotted some out  I just blotted them out  In my memory  I wish I had a new one  All the ones  When I used to  Hang out with the entire family  Wow  They were quite a collection  Of um  Even Annie Marr  Annie Mag  All the cousins 
[03:00:30]  And fucking  Uncles  And brothers  And fucking  Yeah  Crazy  And there I was  Fucking  Driving up in my Volkswagen  Bug  With no heat  To get for that  Fucking $800  Engagement ring  Nice  That I bought  At the Penn Station  Nice  Like it  Fucking  True love  Right from the start  Man  Every  Every second  Of that relationship  Spelt a disaster  It's just  Everything 
[03:01:00]  From meeting  To proposal  To fucking  Marriage  To divorce  The whole thing  Was just bad  Chalked the whole thing  Up to one big mistake  Right  Exactly  Yeah  Like right from the start  It should have been like  No that's not the way  You usually do things  But guys would  Rather be single  I don't know why  You would do that  I don't know  Guys would just  Rather be single  At that point  I felt like  We all do stupid things  Obviously  But  I felt like  You know  This is how I'm gonna  Enter  Fuck you Jay 
[03:01:30]  What did Jay say  You killing her dog  That's been  Blown  That's been  Blown out of proportion  Over the years  Chester  Why are you crying  Fucking Jay  We've told that story  Chester  For the record  I love animals  Of course  As long as they don't  Make me sneeze  Or eat your fucking  Prime rib  Prime rib  When the Knicks are in  The fucking playoffs  Big game  Oh god 
[03:02:00]  What a wacky time  That was  Louis C.K.  Was on the Daily Show  Last night  Yeah  It's a quick hit  I'm thinking  We could play it  For our power  I'd love to hear it  Can I get Louis back on again  Isn't he in the new  Woody Allen movie  Yes  That's what he was promoting  Wow very cool  We had Dice here yesterday  Opie  How'd it go  You weren't here  Oh man  Fuck  Dice got a part  That was originally  Louis went  For the part  That Dice got  It was actually good  We pretty much 
[03:02:30]  Did an interview  He's good  But it wasn't just like  Like Dice  You know  Hey  Suck my dick  We actually sat  And conducted  An interview with Dice  Now that he's podcasting  He understands the process  He's got all the stuff  Going on  The movie  The podcast  Live shows  The special DVD  So you know  We just talked about  All that stuff  Kind of fucking fun  Yeah  The Dice man  But Louis is in that movie too  The Woody Allen movie  And he was on the Daily Show 
[03:03:00]  I guess Jon Stewart's been on vacation  For like three months  It's been a while  What the fuck is going on  He took the summer off  For what  I forgot  Shooting a movie  Oh that's right  Jon I got some advice for you  In your show  You don't need to be there  Three days a week  Three days a week  Three days a week  Because that's how many times  You want to show up  During the week  You ring  You ring  Jesus Bob 
[03:03:30]  Oh god  So why don't we play  The Louis thing  Why don't we  Alright  Louis CK  On The Daily Show  Everyone  Yes  Yes  How about that  How about that  Does that  What  Yeah  Alright now  Okay  At a point it starts to sound sarcastic  Yeah it's really rude  Yeah  But that really fills the sails a little bit 
[03:04:00]  Thank you so much for being here  Thank you very much  Congratulations on the royal baby  Oh yeah  Yes  I wasn't going to say  But that's my kid  Yeah  It is  It's my kid  I don't understand why  That's  Yeah I don't  I don't understand why  That's a big deal  I don't know  It's  There's a lot  There was what  Fifty babies born in Brooklyn  Today probably  Yeah but none  Yeah but none of them  Are going to be the greatest baby  In the history of the world  No  No  This baby is born 
[03:04:30]  With a castle already  Yeah that's right  With a couple of castles  Yeah that's right people born in Brooklyn  Just have a few white castles  They can go and eat in  That's it  That's it  That's less  That's objectively less good  So this is  Pretty good  Blue Jasmine  Blue Jasmine  Woody Allen movie  That's right  Yeah yeah  It's a Woody Allen movie  That must have been  As a comedian  Yeah  That must have been  Pretty amazing  Yeah  To spend any amount of time  Yes  That's all I wanted to do  Was meet him before he died  That was my goal  I mean anybody 
[03:05:00]  Not because he's old  But anybody  I mean you can get hit  By a truck as easily  As die of old age  Right did you  Is that how you said that  Woody I'm so glad  I'm so glad you didn't die  Before this  I just went  Hey nice to meet you  Yes  And then I was like  Done  Did it  Did it  Now you can  Go ahead  Now you can cork it  Get your dirt nap  Enjoy yourself  But yeah  You must  As a kid  I probably knew  The nightclub years album  Off by heart  Yes  Me too  Love Woody  And he was a hero of mine  And one of the best ever 
[03:05:30]  And so I really just wanted to  Have any contact with him  In the press for this movie  He started to say that he might  Do a little stand up again  That's what I heard  Yeah  Is there any way you'd nudge him  To death  I'll ask him to  I'll probably never see him again  I was in the movie for three days  And I was like  You know  The way I looked at it  They were making a movie  And I got to be in it  Yeah  I wasn't really like  I'm just  I'm this guy  Who bothers this poor woman  Played by Sally Hawkins  And I  You know  I have sex with her  About five times in the movie 
[03:06:00]  In the car  And in the closet  I'm real seedy  Just gross  Yeah  I love the way  You described your character  As one of those stories  That women carry around  Yeah it's one of those things  That yeah  Yeah  I'm one of those things  That happened to some poor lady  Yeah  That's what I play in this movie  I feel like at some point  In our lives  We have all been that story  To a woman  And we just have to own that  For the rest of our lives  Well I don't think most guys realize  That all women have horrible stories 
[03:06:30]  I mean  We have stories  That are like  I can't believe I did that  Yeah  So  But they have stories  Like I can't even  Tell the police  That happen  Because it's so embarrassing  They do  I grew up with three sisters  So that's what every  You know  Right  They all have that  They carry that around  That's what that's  That is what is beautiful  About this movie  You haven't even seen this movie  I haven't seen it  I've seen it  It's great  It's good right  It's good 
[03:07:00]  This is usually how  These kind of movie interviews  Go  What's it like  It's good  I heard it's good  No I don't want  To tip the premieres tonight  So I wanted to wait  Till tonight to see it  But it seems  From what I understand  Everybody in the movie  Is a liar  Most people in the movie  Are lying about something  And I can play liar as well  Because I understand  You lie because life  Is not that great  Right  So by lying  You get to add dimension  To your life  That doesn't really exist  Yes  That makes sense  So that's why  I play a guy  Who's  I mean I don't want  To tell about it 
[03:07:30]  Because it's  You're going to  Well how would you know  You haven't even  F***ing seen it  No  You're just guessing  At this point  Also  Andrew Dice Clay  Is in this movie  Yeah and originally  I tried out for his part  Oh you did  I did  My first  My audition for the movie  Was for the part  That he ended up doing  And Dice is great  He's a really good actor  He's brilliant  He's absolutely brilliant  In this  I guess  I urge everybody to see it  I heard it's really great  I had a quick final question for you 
[03:08:00]  Rolling Stone has called you  Both the funniest comedian in America  And a jerk off genius  Yeah  Which title would you like  On your headstone  Well they put that kid on the cover  That blew up Boston  So f*** them  I don't care  Louis C.K. ladies and gentlemen  Watch out now  The Opinion Anthony show continues  Sort of  After O&A Live  With Sam Roberts 
[03:08:30]  Is next  Jim Norton  Is a moderately successful comedian  An average author  And a terrible actor  And your chance to speak  Directly with him  Call 866-969-1969  The phone lines are open  And the Jim Norton show  Starts now 
[03:09:00]  Hello  Hello  We have no phone calls yet  Because  E-Rock did not play  The thing that would  Let you know  That we were going to be  Doing my show  But the reason  E-Rock didn't play that  As much as I would love to  Berate Eric  For no good reason  Is because  He was not told  What happens is  We're traveling tomorrow  And I missed  And I missed last week's  Advice show 
[03:09:30]  And obviously  Sam does a great job  On the after show  As much as we like to  Mock him  And you know  Humiliate him  Because he's a terrible person  He does a great after show  But you know  I'm contractually bound  To do this  And I love doing it  And I didn't want to miss  Two in a row  So whatever  So I'm doing it today  And Gary and I  Texted yesterday  He goes  Okay that's great  And then he tells Sam  And he tells Travis  But those guys  Are not going to tell E-Rock  Because they like  When E-Rock  Doesn't know something  And a part of me 
[03:10:00]  Does understand that  There is some fun  In watching your friends  Suffer  Or your co-workers  Suffer  But I think Gary  Should have let Eric know  That you know  Hey Eric  Tomorrow there's a  Kid doing an advice show  Who's on the  By the way  Who's on the  Well let me just  Go right to the phone  I don't even need  Descriptions  We'll go right  Just put them on hold  866  Oh boy I pushed it  All the way down  I didn't mean to do that  866-969-1969  That's Eric's home number  If you want to call  And just talk about it  He's very lonely  John in New Jersey 
[03:10:30]  What's up buddy  Hey how you doing Jimmy  What's going on buddy  Hi man  Alright here's the deal  I got a buddy  I've been present him  A long time  And my wife and I  Just had a kid  Not too long ago  And I'm a busy guy  I work 6 days a week  He works a lot as well  He works about 2 hours away  In the city  And he keeps saying  You know over and over again  He keeps saying  Hey I'll come by this weekend  I'll come by this weekend  Yeah I'll be by  Be by  And he never comes by  He doesn't call  He doesn't show  Whatever  And it's getting to the point 
[03:11:00]  Where I'm starting to take it personally  You know I'm not his boss  And I'm not his wife  So he doesn't answer to me  But I'm at the point  Where I'm like  What the fuck  I'm starting to take it personally  You know  And I just want to know  Am I being a  Am I being a pain in the ass friend  Wait let me ask  He just had the kid  Or you did  I did  Okay so what is  Is he married with kids  No  He actually just got  He's been dating a girl a while  And just took the next step  They got engaged  Oh okay  I wonder why  Who knows  Maybe he feels weird 
[03:11:30]  About you having a kid  Not that he hates it  But maybe  Sometimes when your friends  Like you realize  Like wow  Like Bobby Kelly  Just had a kid with Dawn  And you know  They wanted a kid  I was really happy for them  But it is different now  Not  My feelings haven't changed  For them or Bobby  But it's like  I know he can't just go out  And do the shit  That he used to do  You know what I mean  Because he has an added responsibility  So I still go over there  And see him  But it's like  Ah fuck  I can't call Bob  Just to go out  And do this anymore  So maybe he's kind of 
[03:12:00]  Going through that  Where he's afraid  That he can't do as much stuff  With you off the cuff  I don't know  Yeah  And the whole  I kind of  I kind of said to him  Like  Listen man  You know  I'm just starting  Letting you know  Just man to man  When you say you're going to do something  You should do it  You know  And I'm starting to take it personally  You don't come by  And I understand you're busy  And I don't begrudge you  For having shit to do  We all got shit to do  I'm the busiest guy who knows  But  Don't tell me you're going to come by  If you have no attention  To coming by  If you have tickets to a  Freaking hockey game  And you know you're not coming by  Don't tell me you're going to come by 
[03:12:30]  And said look man  I feel like you're doing this  Yeah  I said pretty much exactly  What I just said to you  And he just said  You know  He said I'm being a sissy  And I'm  Being a little pissy  And I need to fucking relax  And I haven't spoken to him  How many times has it happened?  Five  And it's  Messed up  Because I'll ask him to come by  During the week  Like hey man  You want to swing by later?  And just on his own  He'll say no I can't  I'm busy  But I'll come by on Saturday  Definitely  And then Saturday he'll come and go  And he won't come  He won't call  And it's gotten to the point 
[03:13:00]  Where my wife  Is like what is he  Not like me or something  And it's like you know  Maybe it represents something to him  Sometimes  Your friends settling down  And your friends having children  Makes you feel older  Because that's one more person  When my friends start having kids  I start to feel boxed in  Like oh my god  It's my turn next  It's my turn  Like I thank god  For Colin Quinn  He's not married  And he's probably impotent  And he has no children  And he's probably  Fucking completely sterile  But I thank god  For my friends like that  Because otherwise 
[03:13:30]  I would feel completely isolated  Or Anthony  And if you  Even Iraq  Has got no kids  But he's married  And Travis is married  And Sam is married  So maybe that's what it is  Just stop asking  And that's all  Fuck him  Yeah it's kind of what I  Kind of the route I took  And he said all right  Well if he wants to come over  He'll give me a phone  And he'll come over  And that's that  He'll come around buddy  All right Jimmy  Thanks a lot buddy  Appreciate it  All right take care  The guy whose wife  Was an alcoholic  Hung up huh  Yeah  All right let's go with  The fiance was  And may still be a prostitute  Hello Mike  Jaren what's up buddy 
[03:14:00]  How are you  Good  Honored to talk to you  Thank you  What's your take on people changing  After being in the industry  Well how long  Excuse me  How long have you been  With this girl  A couple years  You've been with her  A couple of years  And now sorry  Now Tommy the wife's  An alcoholic is back on  What happened  I don't know  What's happening in there  I'm fine again  All right  Sorry buddy go ahead  So you dated her  A couple of years  Yeah you know  The usual  Mine's different 
[03:14:30]  Mine's different  She's not like  All the other strippers  Come to find out  There was no difference  So she was  Oh she was a stripper  Who did extras  Yes  Okay  Is she still dancing  Yeah  Okay  Have you asked her  To stop and to get out of it  She tried  But keeps getting  Pulled into the industry  Like you know  Getting sucked back in  Like Al Pacino  You know  Well it's the money right  What she doesn't like  She doesn't want to go  Get a square job  Because the money is too good  And she's used to being  Her own boss  And all that shit  Exactly  Is she still hooking 
[03:15:00]  She has no  But  Do you trust her  No  Then why are you  Going to marry her  Well I'm not now  Okay  Because she said  Fiance  Is she your fiance  Took a step back  From that  Oh you did  Okay  Well I mean  Look dude  If it's something  That really bothers you  If her job  Really bothers you  And she's not willing  To leave that job  I understand  Why dating someone  Who's stripping  Would bother you  You make you get jealous  You don't want other men  Having access to your wife  Like that 
[03:15:30]  And all this sexual energy  She's giving other people  Like when you're dating  Somebody that's really hot  But then all of a sudden  When you get serious  And you start to look at a life  It can be difficult  For some guys  It might be hard for me too  You know  I hear you bro  So I would suggest  You don't give her  An ultimatum angrily  But just tell her like  Look  I can't really handle this anymore  Or do you make enough money  For the both of you  Yeah but I don't want to though  I don't  I don't need another dependent  No no no no  But I mean  If she gets a job  Where she makes a lot less money  Are you okay with that 
[03:16:00]  Yeah  Because what is she going to do  If she's been dancing  All these years  Yeah  Not much  Yeah  So you either  You have to live with her  Well yeah  It's the life she knows  You're going to have to  Either live with it  And learn to adjust  Or she's going to have  To take less money  But you can't live  Resenting or panicking  And thinking she's  Hooking on the side  You're never going to  Make it that way  I hear you bro  Thanks so much  For the reinforcement man  Good luck my friend  Tommy in Florida  Wife's an alcoholic  Not sure what to do  Okay I thought we lost you 
[03:16:30]  There Tommy  Hey Jimmy  Yeah I was like  I'm right here  Okay  But yeah  She's been a severe  We both drank  You know  I'm 41  She's 40  But she's been severe  Alcoholic  Two and a half years  Just put her in rehab  For three weeks  She was out  For almost a month  She's been cleaning  50 days  Okay  And then Sunday  I mean her thing  Was this vodka  Room temperature vodka  Just chugged  And just ridiculous  I mean I know  You know what I'm  Talking about  Sure  Because you can't 
[03:17:00]  Handle it  Drunk  And so we go  To the beach house  She's on the way  We have two kids  A daughter and a son  Six and four  And she's like  Hey if you want  A six pack  I quit drinking too  I could go with  It doesn't matter  Right  I enjoy  Don't get me wrong  I enjoy putting down  Some beers  A football game  Or what not  But it doesn't kill me  So I quit too  I was at 30 days  Clean  And I'm going to  A with her  Once a week  And then on my own  Just to say hey  But anyways  We went to the beach house  She's like hey look 
[03:17:30]  If you want a six pack  A beer  Just get you one  Come to find out  She had some vodka  Stashed after 50 days  Just got snot drunk  And then yesterday  Did it again  And this morning  She's crying  You know  I ruined everything  But I've been over  Backwards  Just  It's just been  Intolerable  And  I don't know  I still love her  But  Everyone I talked to  Like her sponsor  I even talked to her  Last night  She's like look  You gotta work on yourself  You gotta take care of Tommy  And you gotta take care of his kids  Right  So I'm to the point now 
[03:18:00]  Where like  I don't know what else to do  I mean she swears up and down  She's taking this Vivitrol shot  To help block this craving  And stuff  Is she going to any kind of meetings?  She goes  She's doing 90 in 90 days  Okay  And wait  And she hasn't drank since then  Or she has?  She drank Sunday and yesterday  Okay  But she is going to meetings?  Yeah  She went to a meeting  Drunk last night  Okay  She went back to the bar  I said if you got pulled over  She took that car door  And it just smelled like  Somebody dumped  Blocked in there  Well let me ask you 
[03:18:30]  Do you go to a 12 step program  For people who live  Or deal with alcoholics?  I have been going to Al-Anon  And then  I also talked to a counselor  I got  My company is really good  They pay for all  Rehab  They pay for all  Marriage counseling  They pay for my counselor too  Well here's what my suggestion would be  Because  The reason I would say  Don't completely give up on her  Is because  She is going to meetings  I'm not saying that  That's the cure all  For someone who doesn't want to stop  But a lot of times  What you hear there  Will seep in 
[03:19:00]  So  If she's making some kind of an effort  And you see that she's honestly trying to do it  Or she's  Even if she's only half trying  But she's making  She's kind of got her foot in that door a little bit  I would suggest that you keep  A. Talking to a counselor  And going to some  Getting yourself some support  Because that's more important than you think  Because even though it's not your fault  What she does  Being codependent  And living with someone  Who's an alky or a drug addict  It becomes this fucking thing  Where we feed off each other  It's this sick energy 
[03:19:30]  Where the codependent and the alcoholic  Push each other's buttons  And feed off each other  And you know  A becomes B  Becomes C  Becomes D  And it's how it works  And it's not that we  Consciously decide that stuff  It just becomes a part of our lives  And the way we interact  So the way to break that pattern  You're only  Worrying about your end  Will be going to some kind of a 12 step meeting  Get yourself a sponsor  And then learn how to break  Your part of that pattern  And then see how you feel about it  But I would suggest doing that 
[03:20:00]  Because it will give you  A much better idea  Of whether or not  You really want to leave  Or whether or not  You really want to stay  Yeah  And one other thing  I was  You know  She came back  You know  We hadn't had sex  In like three months  And she was like  I'm not ready for that  And then finally  She was like  Okay  And man  Once everything just started clicking  Just like two days later  Sure  Just  Bam  And what I've been told  Also by my account  I just started going last week  I was like  Shit  I gotta see somebody  Try to fucking go crazy  And 
[03:20:30]  The one thing I haven't told  I don't know what you think  I haven't left her  I don't think she's hit bottom yet  She had to go to rehab  Because me and her mom  Her sister made her go  And  You know  She's like  Well  I think in the back of my mind  I can do this  Tommy's still gonna be around  Well  And thank you for the call  I appreciate it very much  I appreciate it  You know  It's hard to say  Because sometimes  You know  I mean  My parents  My dad is sober  And my mother left my father  That was in 
[03:21:00]  I guess 1970  And that was  The final straw  Like there's weird stuff  That motivates people  To get sober  And I guess that motivated him  So sometimes  Leaving somebody  Can save their life  You know  I think that varies  From case to case  Like  I would suggest  That Tommy  Maybe she has hit bottom  Maybe she hasn't  But bottom doesn't have to be  Death  Do we get her on the phone?  No she's not there yet  Oh she's not there  Okay we're trying  Hang on  Edward in New Jersey  I'm gonna get to you 
[03:21:30]  He believes he's transgendered  He's not sure  I'm hoping he's not kidding around  But we're trying to get Bailey  On the line  Because I think Bailey  Would be much better  At answering that  And unfortunately  She's not here today  But she's a much more  Qualified person  To answer that  If you want to talk about  How much to charge  For a blowjob  That I can help you with  But alright  Let's talk to Drake  In Staten Island  Addicted to sex  Oh I thought it said  To his ex  Addicted to sex  Yes Drake  I used to never have a problem  With going to a strip club  When I was younger  I've never been good 
[03:22:00]  At having long term  Relationships  That worked out  I had a couple  Girlfriends here and there  And then the last one I had  Was the hottest girl I was with  We were together  A couple months  And then it didn't work out  I got used to having sex  On a normal basis  And after I broke up  With her I noticed  That all of a sudden  Like masturbating  Wasn't good enough anymore  And I had to go to  Strip club  Like every time  I would get that urge  Sure 
[03:22:30]  And it got to a point  Where I'm going up  Like two  Two to three times a week  And I just noticed  I'm spending  All my extra money on that  And I just want to  Be able to do  Something different  And I'm not  It's not like  Easy to pick up girls  Where I am  Well I'll tell you  Something Drake  One thing I relate  To what you're saying  Because one problem  With that  And the hard part of it  Is it becomes  The quick fix  Like whenever I get  The urge to jerk off  I jerk off  You know whenever  You get the urge 
[03:23:00]  To look at a girl  You go to a strip club  And you spend your money  And I still actively  Do that a lot  The porn  The masturbating  And the reality is  It saves us  And it's not a good thing  But it prevents us  From doing any real work  To have a relationship  Like  You know what I mean  It's like  Why would I need to go out  And meet a girl  And put up with the possibility  Of not having sex  When I can just watch porn  And jerk off  Or why would you actually  Take the risk of rejection  By going to  Like say you see a girl  In the mall  You want to talk to  Why take the risk 
[03:23:30]  On being humiliated  And having to go out  To dinner  Or not getting the date  When you can just go  To a strip club  And get a lap dance  And jizz in your pants  Like  It's okay to be horny  And to go to a strip club  But when it begins to replace  Real life things  That we should be doing  It's unhealthy  Yeah  And I noticed that  I was trying to like  Break away from doing that  Like  On the nights that I would do that  If I had free time  Like  Maybe try to go to the tiki bar  And like  Try to like  Actually have like  A normal interaction with a girl  Because it's basically  Not going to happen in a strip club 
[03:24:00]  You're only there for one thing  Sure  So I'm just trying to  Do like those  Things that you said  And it is a  Quick fix  It's like  Sometimes it's like  A lazy way out  You know  Yeah  It can be very lazy  And my suggestion would be  Try to meet girls  Under normal circumstances  Because I've spent a lot of years  It's this endless search  Like sex addiction  Is like any other addiction  It's an endless search  For that one  I used to drink a lot  And I had like 
[03:24:30]  That addiction  And I was able to  Beat that all on my own  Like I  I was a pothead  For like  13 years  And I started to drink  At the end  And I just stopped  I was able to  Stop all that  Like single  And you know  Like I  Used to always  Like create a reason  Why I was okay  To do those  And then one day  I just knew  Like I had to stop  For myself  And I've been good  But then it seems like  This has been like  The next thing  I have to tackle  In my life  Yeah  I mean sometimes  That's how it is  Because we replace things  We replace one  With the  We lost Edward 
[03:25:00]  Huh  The  Sorry about that  Maybe he was just joking  I tell Belly  Thank you anyway  She calls  Yeah we replace one  With the other  Thank you very much  For the call Drake  I appreciate it  But I think what  Happened is  What's that  What did he say  Oh sorry buddy  That wasn't intentional  A lot of times  You know  You replace one  With the other  That's all it is  And I've done that  And you know  Again I'm guilty of it  So I know what I'm  Talking about  I don't drink  And I don't do drugs  Thank God  I don't fucking gamble  That was never a big one  But the sex for me 
[03:25:30]  Sex was always one  That was there  And then when I quit  Drinking and getting drugs  I couldn't you know  Satisfy that dopamine drip  So then it becomes sex  And sometimes it's food  It's very hard to just be  Addiction free in this world  Especially on a computer  How do you not  Jerk off on your laptop  For Pete's sake  And I'm asking you seriously  Alright let's see  Michael in Detroit  Trouble getting motivated  To have sex with girlfriend  Hi Michael  Hey Jim  This is Michael from Detroit  Sorry I'm trying to use  A fake name here  That's okay buddy  Whatever  Successful  But yeah 
[03:26:00]  My girlfriend and I  We've been going on  For about two years  It started out  As a long distance relationship  Just dating online  And then we started  To get together  And it's like  Every time I saw her  We always had sex  And now that  We've lived together  For about  13-14 months  I just don't  Have any motivation  To have sex with her  And she's a really  Sexual person  She really likes sex  And she wants to have kids  And you know  That's kind of where  This whole thing is going  But it's like  I get home 
[03:26:30]  And I'm just like  This is like work  It's not fun  Well was part of the attraction  Getting her there  To begin with  Like sometimes  When we're chasing somebody  And we're having  An online relationship  Getting them  Or owning them  Or having them  Be ours  Becomes the high  And then once you get that  Once you have them  Sometimes like  Alright now I got you  Now what  Yeah  Okay  I mean maybe that's it  Or maybe you guys  Have  You know maybe  Your sex life  Hits a wall 
[03:27:00]  Because you're just  Doing the same things  Over and over again  You need to spice it up  A little  I mean I don't know  What's the difference  Between when you  Started fucking  And now  Would she come see you  For a couple days  And then go home  Yeah  Yeah pretty much  She would see me  For like  I would go to her place  Or she would come  To my place  Because we lived  About 40 miles apart  Okay  And we would have  We would just have  Just like  Furniture breaking sex  And now it's just like  So like anything else  Once you own it  Once you have it  It's not as appealing  That's  That's  That's like  The curse of all  Of all of us man 
[03:27:30]  It's really hard  To appreciate something  When you have it  Like we fight  For these things  We want this girl  Or we want this guy  Or whatever it is you want  And then once  We're with the person  How do I maintain  The same level  Of interest  Or excitement  About the person  That I had to get them  I think married people  Have been dealing with  This shit  Since time out of mind  And I think  In our generation  In this time  Where we are  It's harder  Than it ever was  Because I don't 
[03:28:00]  People say  Ah no  It's always been hard  To maintain that fire  But we have  The availability  Of you know  You can go on Facebook  And talk to 20 different people  Or Twitter  And 20  Match.com  There's a million ways  To see a million different people  You could do it at work  You could do it at home  While your wife's in the next room  You could be carrying on  A relationship  And an affair  You couldn't do that years ago  When you had to talk on the phone  So I think for us  It's a lot harder  To appreciate somebody  Once we have them  And not just start looking  For the next thing  I think 
[03:28:30]  Because you know  Online  You're still online  Have you contacted  Any other women online  Is there any other  Intrigue going on?  No  No actually  And that's the funny thing  We actually  We kind of determined  That you know  Our weight was kind of  Like a physical weight  And you know  The way we were eating  And the way we were  You know  Existing was  You know  Not good  So you know  She's lost  Since January  She's lost 50 pounds  And I've lost 70  On this  Or closer to 80  Now on this program  We're both in a lot  Better shape than we were  So I find her more  Attractive that way 
[03:29:00]  But again  It's like  I think what you're saying  Is right  Where it's like  I have her now  And it's like  I'm just trying to  You know  Whenever I do have sex  With her  It's because she prompts it  And it's because  You know  I just  I eventually cave  Well you don't have to  Work for it  See that's the thing  Let me ask you too  Are there times  When you come home  And you're just not horny  And she's kind of like  Crawling all over you  Yes  Absolutely  Here's what happens  Okay  And this is something  That men are not good at  See we're so trained  That only a woman  Should say no 
[03:29:30]  Like a lot of times  You know  We start to resent a person  When they don't pick up  Our signals  Like I've had girls  Like I like my nipples  Played with and stuff  But I've had girls  Who didn't know  That I didn't want to be sexual  Licking my nipples  And I remember  I wanted to crawl out of my skin  And scream  I was so fucking angry  At being touched  When I didn't want to be touched  Now that's a two-fold thing  I should have said  Like hey  I'm really not in the mood  Right now baby  I didn't know how to do that 
[03:30:00]  As a woman  They're trained to do that  Like hey  I'm not feeling it right now  We're trained to pursue  So I fuck out  The old lady  Doesn't want to fuck me  What the hell  But we forget  That we are not machines  Our dicks are not machines  So sometimes  You don't want to be touched  Or you just want to not be sexual  So instead of being comfortable  Enough to go  Hey look  Not right now  Because then instead of  Instead of  Because women aren't trained  To hear that shit  So they're like  What's wrong with me  You don't like me  Like they don't know  How to hear no  And we don't know  How to say it  So maybe you could try 
[03:30:30]  Being honest about  When you don't want to have sex  Saying look  I'm really tired right now  I'd rather not  I just want to hang out  And talk  Or I just want to  You know  Because I'm sure  That women are comfortable  Saying that to us  Okay yeah  Because that's  That was part  That was actually  Kind of a big blow up  Last  No not last night  But the night before  Is that  You know  We were making out  Pretty heavy  And I'm  You know  I said  Do you want to have sex  And I said  In kind of this  Really shitty  Accusatory tone  Like it was  Inconvenencing me  And that really 
[03:31:00]  Hurt her feelings  Sure  She felt like  That you know  She wasn't  You know  She's not pretty enough  And that she  You know  That our sex life  Is you know  On the  In the shitter  Which it kind of is  So  I think what you're saying  Has a lot of weight  I think what you're saying  Is probably very accurate  I appreciate the advice  Jim  Thank you so much  Okay buddy  Yeah talk to her  Tell her nicely  You never want to tell somebody  That stuff in a sexual moment  When somebody's feeling sexy  And we're rejected  It's humiliating  And the reason 
[03:31:30]  That we reject people  Like that  Is because we have  This resentment build up  Where instead of  Sitting down  In a calm moment  And going  Look I don't want you  To think I'm unattracted  To you  But you know  This is what I've been  Feeling lately  We just wind up  Holding it in  And holding it in  And then one time  They stroke your arm  And we're like  Don't touch me  You know  And they're like  What the fuck did I do  So instead of  Letting it blow up  Just have a nice chat  While you're both  Having coffee  Or something  Alright  Alright  Awesome Jim  Thank you so much  Man you're doing  Good work here  God bless  Alright thank you  Good luck you little sweetie  Alright let's see 
[03:32:00]  Phil in California  You're sober  Trying to get back  Into dating  Hello Phil  Hey Jim how's it going  I'm good buddy  Good yeah  I just hit the year  You know  Alcoholics  All that fun stuff  Congratulations  Thanks buddy  You're doing all the  All the stuff  You're supposed to be doing  Great  And all that I've  Ever had in my life  Looking back  Are those  Sick codependent  Relationships  The dude a couple  Callers back  Was talking about  And that's what  Prompted me to call  If I'm starting to  Get you know 
[03:32:30]  Interested in this  One girl  And she's interested  In me  And it scares  The living shit  Out of me  Because I don't  Want to go back  To that horrible  I haven't had  A good dating life  Sure  So um  And this is  Completely new  To me  As far as  Having a healthy  Relationship  I don't think  I've ever had one  It's also harder  To approach people  When we're sober  Until we're used to it  Because you know  Alcohol gives you  That fucking confidence  That you know  It's a big confidence  You know  That we lose  When we quit drinking  For a while 
[03:33:00]  It's a fake confidence  But we you know  It's still a confidence  To talk to people  And um  You know a lot of times  It's much harder to do  When we're sober  But you'll  You'll get better  At it man  Don't don't expect  All those years  Of behaving a certain way  To change overnight  You know  Just give yourself  That would be my advice  And my suggestion  Is take it slow  You know  You'll get back  Into dating  You'll have the girlfriends  You'll have the heartbreaks  All the shit  That you would have had  Will come to you  Okay  Don't but don't panic  And go  Fuck it's a year  And I can't get a girl  It will come 
[03:33:30]  You maybe  You'll meet somebody sober  Um  You know  Maybe you'll have something  You'll have something  Probably a little bit nicer  Than you think  But you know  It might just take  A little trial and error  You may have to feel  Your way around  Being sober  Right  I have this girl  That um  I pretty much  Got set up with her  And I dig her a lot  She has multiple years  And I revert back  To that like  High school  Because I was a super fat  Kid in high school  I revert to like that  That little scared  Little boy again 
[03:34:00]  And like when I was drinking  I was like  I could just  Get a girl to fuck  But you know  And then  When I get in the relationship  It just ends up  She's an alcoholic too  And it was just  Never good  So  Right  I'm 31  Going back to like  A 17 year old  Fat kid mentality  Oh yeah  That's what happens man  We stop growing emotionally  When the addiction  Really kicks in  So we have to  You know  A lot of times  We're you know  We're 30 year old guys  And 15 year old  50 year old guys  And 30 year old bodies  But you know  Again  That will work itself out  You know  You'll get better at it 
[03:34:30]  But you know  The thing that gave you  The false confidence  Which is the alcohol  Or the drugs  Is also the thing  That leads us  Into terrible relationships  Because we wind up like  Yeah I had the fake confidence  And I convinced the girl  To fuck  But I was so fucked up  I didn't realize  That she was a psychopath  Until I was dating her  For three months  Now it's a little harder  But you'll probably  Make better decisions overall  And dating someone  Who's been sober  For a while  Hey look  Maybe it will work out  Maybe it won't work out  But it probably  You know  I would say  Give this one a shot  And I understand 
[03:35:00]  Reverting to being scared  Because we're scared  Of losing the person  Just work through it  You know  Being afraid is okay  It's normal  It's what we do  When we're afraid  That's you know  They say bravery  Is not the absence  Of cowardice  It's doing something  Despite being afraid  Did that make sense?  Bravery is not  The absence of fear  It's doing something  Despite being afraid  So it's okay  If you're scared man  Alright man  I appreciate it  Thank you  I butchered that quote  Really badly  It's not the absence  But you don't understand  Did you get what I meant  D-Rock?  Trying to sound deep 
[03:35:30]  No but it's just  It's not my quote  I've heard it  You know  But yeah  You're right  I should just stick  To the fucking basics  You know  Go get some puss  I said it all wrong  How humiliating  Be fucked up  Like a drunk over  Right here on the air  Just cried  That's your trigger  Okay let's see  Andy in Virginia  Said dating an older woman  And her son looks like you  Hey Jim  How old are you  And how old is the woman? 
[03:36:00]  She's 62  And I am 38  Oh boy okay  Yeah and she has a son  He's younger than I am  But you can obviously tell  I deliver heating oil  And I met her last winter  And he is younger than me  But you can obviously tell  There is just a resemblance  And everyone knows that he's not my son  But you can just tell that it's kind of odd  Well did it  Let me ask you  Did it ever occur to you  That he might look like his dad 
[03:36:30]  And maybe you remind her of the dad?  Yeah that  I get that  But everybody else  Her people and family and friends  I don't know  They're not thinking that  They're just thinking  Why are you dating a guy  That looks like your son?  Who cares what they think?  Fuck them  Well that's the thing  It's making it uncomfortable for us  She sees the resemblance  She doesn't think it's a big deal  I don't really think it's a big deal 
[03:37:00]  But everyone else  My family  Her family  Everyone thinks it's a big deal  And I'm not that really great  At relationships and everything  I like her  But how far should I go  With this relationship  Knowing there's going to be  That much difficulties  And the son  Her son even thinks it's strange  She's like  She's even asking  Mom why are you dating a guy  That looks  That's what I'm going to look like  When I'm older  It's funny how everybody is concerned  With how this girlfriend's  This girl's boyfriend looks 
[03:37:30]  She's 62  And she got a younger guy  And they're all complaining  Like here's the  The only people that matter  Are you and her  You're in your 30  You're 38  She's 62  You're way beyond  What the family thinks matters  It means nothing  So how far should you take it  With this woman  It depends on how willing  She is to be independent  Of her family's  Shitty  Meaningless opinions  About your appearance  If she's married  To what they think  Then fuck her  She's too childish  She shouldn't be married  To what they 
[03:38:00]  But if she knows  Hey I like this guy  I like fucking him  Yeah he looks like my son  But the real important thing  Is he kind of looks like  The son's dad  And that's the kind of guy  I like  That's like saying  Like I don't know  Say you're a blonde guy  I don't know what you look like  But say you're a blonde guy  Kind of tall  Maybe that's what the father  Looked like  And she enjoys  Fucking blonde type  Tall guys  So her kid's gonna be  Blonde and tall  But what is that supposed to mean  She's not supposed to  Want to fuck guys  Like she used to want to fuck  Just because she popped out  A kid who looks like the dad  Doesn't make any sense  Enjoy her  Let her enjoy you  And just make sure 
[03:38:30]  That you are both  Willing to not deal  With the family's opinions  Because they're meaningless  Yeah  Alright well thank you Jimmy  I appreciate it  Alright good luck  Keep fucking banging her  Good for you  You know  Obviously she knows  You look like the son  And it doesn't matter to her  Raul in San Antonio  Has a question about  Properly writing jokes  Hey Jimmy  How you doing man  Good buddy  Yeah I started  Open micing  I would say  Last August  Almost a year now  And I write some 
[03:39:00]  Pretty good jokes  But I was just wondering  What's just like  A good process  To write  You know  I don't know  I mean I would say  That it differs  From comic to comic  Guys like  Who are very regimented  Like Colin  Can make himself  Sit and write  Which is why Colin  Pumps out a fucking  Brilliant hour  About the constitution  I have a hard time  Doing that  My mind is all over the place  A lot of it is my  Obsession with the computer  It's just hard for me  To make myself do that  So I work it out on stage 
[03:39:30]  It works for me  But there's no  I would say  There's no proper way  To properly write a joke  You might want to sit down  And go  Okay this is what I think  Is funny  About this subject  If you're writing jokes  About yourself  Sometimes telling the truth  Is enough  Sometimes telling the truth  With a little twist  Is enough  Sometimes if you're  Writing something  You can make sure  Make a topical reference  In whatever you're  Talking about  And that's the right formula  There's no proper answer  For you right now  Are you trying to write jokes  About yourself 
[03:40:00]  Or what are you doing  I'm writing jokes  Mostly about my life  And my kids  And my wife  Okay  And see the thing  I always get is though  Is that  They always say  That can be too dirty  Or use too many  Like just curse words  And I try to stay away from it  But as soon as I do  As soon as I'm up there  It just comes right out  So I'm just  I'm trying to figure out  A way  To like  Still use it  But calm it down  If I'm doing it too much  And I recorded myself  A few times  And even then  I still think  You know  I could not use that word  It didn't really make sense  To put it there 
[03:40:30]  Well if you're using it  As a crush  Sometimes  Even Richard Pryor said  That he would use  Motherfucker sometimes  As a crush  We all do that  At times  Historically  I've always loved  Profanity  Since childhood  I've loved  What it does  In the language  And there's been times  Where I've fallen  Into that trap  So if there's something  That you're doing  That's blatantly  Overusing it  Then say  Okay I'm going to  Make an effort  To not do that  But as time goes on  You'll find who you are 
[03:41:00]  On stage  Worry more about  The truth  Of what you're saying  Like yeah  If you say  Fuck too much  Okay  Cut it down  But worry more  About the truth  In your jokes  And you know  What are they saying  And are you happy  With what you're talking about  Because the meat of your act  Is what's really important  The profanity  You know  You'll learn to take out  As you get better and better  Because I've learned  As time has gone on  That there are times  Where I'll do a joke  And it's dirty  And I know I want to do it  On Leno  Or I want to do it  Somewhere else  So I have to start  Once the joke is strong 
[03:41:30]  Pulling the profanity out  And hoping the joke  Doesn't collapse  Jim yeah  That's what I've been  Trying to do  I want to  Hey dude  I just want to thank you  For the advice  And I've been following  Your career  For a long time  I remember seeing  On MTV  A long time ago bro  And you're one of the best bro  Thank you so much  Good luck man  Keep writing it  And keep people  Keep kicking them  In the nuts  To quote Joe  Fucking DeRosa's arm  Okay let's see  Nate in Missouri  His wife's got  Strong religious views  He does not 
[03:42:00]  Difficult to go to church  With her  Of course it would be  Hi Nate  Hi Jimmy  Thanks for taking my call  Sure  Yeah my wife  When we got married  About seven years ago  We didn't go to church  At all together  I mean I knew she  Believed in Jesus  And things like that  But I  We never started going  But now  In the past  Three or four years  She really wants to go  And I  I want to  Please her  Because I love her  And she's very 
[03:42:30]  Important to me  But I get in the church  Every Sunday  And I'm like  Looking around  At these people  And I'm like  You all  Are falling for this  Yeah  And I want to believe  Like she does  So that I can just  Follow and make her happy  But I find it hard  To just  Just give in  Well how about this  How about  Instead of trying  To make her happy  By believing in a God  That you  Is not for you  Or that  We're taking a religious view 
[03:43:00]  That's not accurate  Or honest for you  Why don't you make her happy  By being true to yourself  And being yourself  Just don't shit  On what she believes  Like if she wants  To go to church  And she believes  In Jesus  And that's who she is  Don't ridicule her for her  Don't go  What are you going  To church again  You fucking idiot  Like let her go  Like let her enjoy it  And if she wants  To talk to you about it  Maybe you talk about it  After  Respect what she's doing  And hopefully  She can respect  Your not wanting to go  I don't think anybody  Should be forced to go 
[03:43:30]  Yeah  But I don't think  That you should say  To somebody  Don't go  If they believe that either  You know it's become  Very hip to say  Religious people are shitty  But you know  And look  If that's what makes her  Who she is  And she wants to go  More power to her  Well the thing is  I never  Look down on her  For going  And it's just the fact  That she wants me  To be there by her side  And you know  In church  They speak about  It's important for the father  And the family  The man in the household  That needs to be 
[03:44:00]  Following God  If you know  If the family  Is going to follow God  The father has to be there  So she kind of keeps  Like you need to be there  With me  Well that's where she's  I think incorrect  She's trying to force  Her will on you  And I think that's not  A good way to go  So again  Like many people  You always have to make  A decision  Are you know  What's more important to you  If you don't believe  If you've been going  And it's just not going  For you  You may have to  Deal with some bullshit  With her  And say look  I'm not going to go  It's not for me  But I want you to go 
[03:44:30]  If it makes you feel good  And if that's who you are  But you have to be  Sincere in that  I think if you encourage  Somebody to do  What makes them  Who they are  But the father  Doesn't have to be there  She wants to be religious  And you don't  I think that's fair  Okay  Alright  Thank you very much Jimmy  Alright buddy  Good luck  Good luck in hell  When you go there  Alright sorry  Let's see  This is interesting  Father  Wayne in Alabama  The father  Your father is dating  His dead wife's  Best friend  And it's affecting  Your life Wayne  Hello  It's my father-in-law 
[03:45:00]  Oh sorry  Okay  Your wife's  Your wife's dad  Is dating  His wife's  His dead wife's  Best friend  Yeah  They were in the wedding  Together  The whole kind of thing  And she passed  About two and a half  Years ago  And she was  And the best friend  Kind of came over  Was kind of consoling  And now it's kind of  Evolved  Into where they're  You know  Talking about  Living together  And moving in together  And stuff  And to be honest with you  It doesn't affect me  As much as it affects  My wife  Yeah  We have a two-year-old  Daughter  And you know 
[03:45:30]  The father  My father-in-law  Is not around  As much anymore  The woman in his life  Now that was  It's kind of  Taking that away  And kind of  Spend the most  Of her time  He's going out  And drinking  He's become  Somebody that  He really wasn't  When you know  It's not her dad  Anymore  I don't know  What advice  You can give  I just  It's almost like  I really can't  Talk to anybody  About it  It's kind of  Calling anonymity  Right now  I think one thing  And again  Both of my parents  Are living  Luckily  So I have not 
[03:46:00]  Experienced this  So I can't  You know  The death of a parent  Is obviously  A really big thing  More to some people  Than to others  But you know  Losing your mom  Has got to be horrible  Your wife's probably  Having a hard time  With that  And then there's  The thing of  Well he's an adult  And if this is  Helping him  And you know  It's not like  As long as she's not  Fucking a married woman  Or they weren't  Having an affair  While the wife was alive  If this is him  Moving on  And it's two  Consenting adults  Who just realized 
[03:46:30]  They had feelings  For each other  Well that's what it is  Like after 9-11  A lot of firefighters  Were  Or some firefighters  Were dating  The widows  Of firefighters  Who died  And I don't think  These guys  Were being vultures  And swooping in  At all  I think sometimes  In grief  People just come together  In weird ways  So the father  Has obviously  Lost his wife  He's in terrible grief  And here's this  Best friend  Who understands  His grief  And who loved  This woman very much 
[03:47:00]  And for whatever reason  Maybe they connected  On that level  Yeah and that's the  And that's what  I've explained to her  And I actually  Took that stance  With her about  You know  Is it worth your dad  Kind of going into  A deep depression  And not coming out  And just completely  Becoming the shell of him  Sure  Or to try to be happy  And to try to move on  And granted  It's kind of  And then  Would you rather  Be with somebody  That's a complete stranger  Somebody that  Your mom knew  I mean I'm trying  To spin it as much  As I can  But it's just  It's just hard  You know  Trying to  Trying to get her  To come to grips with it 
[03:47:30]  And I think it's harder  On her for the fact  That he's just not around  Like he was  For the granddaughter  Well I'm sure  Look he's going through  Again I don't know  What it's like  To be on either  Of those situations  But it sounds like  She's having a hard time  Because you know  Look she feels  Like she's lost  Both her parents  You know this whole world  That she knew  All of a sudden  Is different  You know with the mother  Dying and then the father  Not being dad  That he always was  But as an adult  She might have to look at it  Like he's an adult too  And he's my dad  But he's also a man  He's just a guy 
[03:48:00]  Who lost his life partner  And he's struggling  To move on  And make sense of it  So she kind of  Has to do double duty  Grieving the mother  As well as the loss  Of the dad  Being there all the time  And being an adult  And saying okay  Fuck it  He's got to get through  This on his own  And realize that  He's just an adult  Like she is  A very tough situation  I mean again  There really is no advice  To give  I would hope  That she's able  To do that  And it'll probably  Balance out 
[03:48:30]  You know who knows  If the father  And the wife's  Ex-wife's  The friend will last  They might not last  It might just be  A grief dealing thing  Or maybe they'll get married  And that's what will help him  Live a productive  Healthy other 25 years  Instead of like you said  Curling up into a depressed ball  And just waiting to die  Yeah  Alright man  Well good deal  I appreciate it  Alright good luck  Let's see here  Logan in Ohio  Dating a virgin  Not sure  How did the flower  For her  Or if you should  Yes Logan  Hey Jim 
[03:49:00]  I just want to say  Thanks for accepting the call  Sure  And I listen to you  All the time  Thank you  And um  I'm 15  And she's a virgin  How old is she?  And she's 14  Okay  Well about to turn 15  How long are you dating her?  Six months  Um  To be honest with you man  And not to sound like an old man  I didn't actually  Have you had sex before?  Yeah  Um  Hello 
[03:49:30]  Oh he got yelled at by his mom  Or something  Did you hear that?  Well hopefully he's listening  I would suggest  If she's 14 years old  Even though you're 15  I would suggest waiting  You know  Just jerk off thinking about it  Because uh  14 years old  Is a little young  To be having sex  And you know what  Are you going to knock her up  You don't get her pregnant  And  I never liked virgins  To be honest with you  Because to me  That was too personal  And I didn't want it  Like give it to a guy  You care about  You're in love with  But I  You know  Look if you're 14 years old 
[03:50:00]  As a girl  You probably should not be fucking  You know  I can't say that to a guy  Because as a guy at 15  I was eating pussy  But I didn't actually have intercourse  Until I was 18  So if you're listening  My friend  I would suggest waiting  Especially if you're questioning it  Or if I even should  If you have that question  In your mind  You probably shouldn't  Error on the side of caution  You don't need a baby  When you're 14 and 15 years old  Just jerk off into a tissue  That's what guys do at our age  Our age  Like I'm 15  You know what I'm saying  Alright let's see  Here  Oh no  Hey Garrett and Kansas 
[03:50:30]  What's going on  Hey Cuntlets  How you doing today  Nice language  Oh Jesus  So  Let me give you  Just a very brief back story  I got in a relationship  About a year ago  And  My girlfriend  As you know  You're inherited  In that group of circles  Sure  Yeah  So  Her friends  Are the nicest people  On planet earth  Which is I think  Where this problem stems from  One of the guys  In her group of friends  Is fucking  Chip  Without your stupid voice  So 
[03:51:00]  This guy  Like literally  The hackiest  Awfulest  Responses  To jokes  Ever known to man  And  He gets courtesy left  From the fucking group  He thinks he's a stand up comedian  Yeah  And it's to the point  Now  Where when I'm in this group  Of  This social group  Of friends  I'm removing myself  From the conversation  Trying to think  Of what shitty punchline  He'll throw out  So you're making something  Out of it  Yeah  And I don't know  I want to call him out 
[03:51:30]  Or I need to know  How to handle this  Because it's  It's driving me crazy  Her friends are too nice  To do anything differently  And  I don't want to be that asshole  That new asshole  In the group  Yeah  This guy is  Going for it  Yeah  Believe me  I've been dealing  With people like that  My whole life  But  You know  There's a line  If you're really good  Friends with the guy  You can call him out  But it's really hard  You'd embarrass your girlfriend  If you did that  You'd embarrass her friends  This is a situation  Where you're more  Tolerating it for her  And the guy's not  Being a jerk off 
[03:52:00]  I think what you're doing  Is the right move  Just try to guess  Which dog shit punchline  He's going to come up with  And I think it's fun  To sometimes  Just enjoy it  For your  Do you ever talk  To your girlfriend  About it  Yeah  Oh  What sucks even more  Is he was obsessed  With her  So he's a douchebag  On all levels  Does she know  Does she think  He's an unfunny lump  After I told her  His awfulness  She caught on to it  That's the thing  Her friend  It's such a weird dynamic 
[03:52:30]  Yeah  But after I called her out  She was like  Oh wow  You're right  His shit isn't funny  Yeah sometimes people  Don't want to admit it  Because it's embarrassing  I would say  Dude try to embrace it  Enjoy it  Like he's awful  You're not him  You don't have to  Hang out with him  All the time  Do what you've been doing  Just keep guessing  What dog shit punchlines  He's going to come up with  Or in your mind  Make fun of him  And I understand  The idea of wanting  To call him out  But it might make  You embarrass your girlfriend  Or her friends  Unnecessarily 
[03:53:00]  It's not really affecting you  Other than he's just  That unfunny lump  In the group  Better him than you  Like let him make  An asshole out of himself  And just enjoy  That you're watching  A guy make an asshole  Out of himself  I hear you  I guess bigger picture  For me  When I look at her  Entire group of friends  I'm like  You fucking dopes  Can't see  This douchebag  Just throwing garbage  And hitting him  Out of the park  Like he gets  A pause break  It's so weird  Yeah believe me  I definitely know  What you mean 
[03:53:30]  And you don't want  To just mention it  Because they might  Go no he's funny  And then tell him  And then it's hurtful  Yeah but at least  You've told your girlfriend  And she can now see it  So you're slowly  Going to erode  His circle of friends  Believe  She'll mention it  To one of them  One time  What the fuck  Is he talking about  I know what you mean  Dude  But I wouldn't  Call him out  Because it's going  To hurt his feelings  And it's going  To embarrass people  For no reason  And he's not hurting  Anybody  He's just an asshole  I guess I'm mean too  No you're not  No you're not mean  You're honest  The guy stinks  Believe me  Hopefully there'll be  An accident in his future 
[03:54:00]  Will he be injured  I would love a cancer  Any kind of horrific  Car accident  I agree  Absolutely  Good luck my friend  Thanks dear  We have like what  A minute left  Less than a minute  Let's get to real quick  Sorry to make you rush  Mike in Tennessee  Seeing a 20 year old girl  Who's addicted to painkillers  Yes Mike  Yeah  She's claiming  That she's wanting to quit  And she's going to go  To a rehab  But I  After a couple of years  Of this  I'm really at the point  That I feel like  I should give up  But I'm not sure  If that would be  The right thing to do  Well Mike 
[03:54:30]  Again I apologize  For rushing you man  We're just running  Out of time  It's not my control  I would suggest  Going  Again I always suggest  This to people  Dating an addict  Or in love with an addict  Go to a 12 step group  That is built  To help those  Who deal with addicts  See if you're  Contributing to the pattern  And if she is unwilling  And refuses to get the help  Regardless of talking about it  Then sometimes you have to leave  Because your happiness  Should not be contingent  On her being high on pills  Or not  If she's willing to get the help 
[03:55:00]  I say you tough it out  And you stick with her  And you support her  But if after a couple of years  She is unwilling to get the help  Sometimes you just have to walk away  Okay?  Okay  Alright sorry to rush you like that brother  I wish we had more time  I apologize  Thank you guys for the call  And thank you E-Rock  For really fucking moving along here  And getting things cooking  And the great Ron and Fez  Are coming up next  So stick around  Jim Norton is now done  Dealing with your bullshit  He'll be back next Wednesday  At 10 a.m. Eastern  7 Pacific
