<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show's final live broadcast of the year was a raucous affair fueled by pre-vacation excess.  The show, featuring Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Stephen Lynch, Jamaican Mike, and Steve C. as studio guests, and three topless Bacardi bartenders (eventually clothed), was characterized by heavy drinking and planned outrageous stunts. Opie recounted a past year-end broadcast that defied their boss's orders, resulting in heightened caution this year.  He also shared a frustrating EverQuest gaming experience that ended in a profanity-laced outburst in front of his girlfriend's mother.  Anthony successfully named numerous cities where the show was syndicated, despite Opie's doubts.

A major segment revolved around a listener challenge: "Litterbox Girl" agreed to use a cat litter box on air for a Samsung DVD player.  This segment involved significant behind-the-scenes negotiation with a station manager regarding acceptable language.  The show also featured extensive discussion of mayhem in sports, specifically Cleveland-related incidents, prompting numerous calls from listeners across various cities, many laced with insults and "F-Yous" directed at other cities and individuals.

The broadcast included reading Chris Overcash's vulgar and offensive year-end list of lessons learned from the show, followed by listener calls adding to the humor and offensiveness.  Rich Voss showed off new Nike shoes. "Litterbox Girl" ultimately completed her challenge, winning the DVD player.  The hosts and guests exchanged gifts, some possibly forged sports memorabilia (a Perry Williams football and a Bob Hope book were mentioned).  A significant portion of the show involved a discussion on the value of a Michael Jordan rookie card.

Further segments featured a song parody of Brother Joe's "Police Got My Car," and discussion of a listener's term paper criticizing the hosts' origin story.  Recurring jokes about Voss's interactions with strippers were prevalent.  The hosts also addressed listener feedback, including criticism of the show's three-hour commercial breaks and four-hour time slot, promising improvements in the new year. Another listener challenge involved winning Aussie tickets, resulting in a private, off-microphone act so shocking that the hosts repeatedly silenced the audience and forbade descriptions of it.  This led to much speculation and more vulgar banter. Jim Norton inspected the “evidence,” resulting in the contestant winning.  The show also included a humorous bit about a Sandy Cain home security system and concluded with goodbyes, plugs for upcoming events, and further crude humor and listener calls.  The show ended with the playing of "Ding, Fries Are Done."

[00:02:00]  huh i like pre-vacation thing this is the we don't give a f show  Well, what's the difference than any other day?  Our guard's down.  Yeah, a little bit.  A little bit.  What's the Britney for?  New album?  Why are you showing us a Britney Spears CD?  You can do that, Ben.  I was just referring to something.  Huh?  I was just referring to something.  Referring to something.  Oh, I got it.  I got it. 
[00:02:30]  I got it.  I'm not slow.  I'm a little under the weather.  There's a big difference.  Okay.  We all went out last night for a little bit, too.  Went over to Paisano's.  And I left early.  You know, me and the girlfriend went home.  And my girlfriend's mother is staying with us for a couple of days.  So I get right on EverQuest, right?  And I proceed to die.  My character dies. 
[00:03:00]  So I lose some of that precious experience point.  I'm like, you mother F-S-F.  Mother effing F-S-F.  Just cursing like a cell.  Yeah.  And then I'm realizing, oh, my God.  She's probably watching me freak out at a game thinking, oh, geez, you know.  Probably smacking my daughter around.  If the game upsets them, Jesus Christ.  Like I was just a raving lunatic because I get pissed off.  When I die like that, and I look over and I go, oh, geez.  She's probably thinking, you know.  Gets mad at the game. 
[00:03:30]  You know what happens when he comes home?  He's in a bad mood.  Smacking the girl around?  No.  Did she enjoy the cursing, though, after a while?  I don't know.  Because you just, you don't stop.  After that, no, I got some help after that.  I sent up the bat signal yesterday.  I got to say hi to this guy, Alzea.  His character name.  On EverQuest.  He's from Cleveland, Opie.  And I said people digging the show there in Cleveland.  So he was helping me out last night.  So there was no more cursing after that.  Everything was going fine.  It's good one city in Ohio takes the show. 
[00:04:00]  We love Cleveland.  We love Cleveland.  Thank you, Cleveland.  I don't think we're alive yet in Columbus.  But I thought we were doing kind of good in Columbus.  I thought so, too, Anthony.  We're not getting any worse.  We're just not getting better.  That's good, right?  It's always good when you don't get any worse.  We could say we're doing well in Ohio.  We're doing well in Ohio.  Yeah, average to two stations together. 
[00:04:30]  When you think about it, even if you guys were doing great in Columbus, who would care?  Cleveland is a bigger city.  Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati, too, right?  Yeah.  We're in Cincinnati, aren't we?  No.  We're like Scott and Larry Flint.  When are we going to be in Cincinnati?  All that Cincinnati humor you've been throwing on the airwaves, that must have been what it is.  The last six months.  I thought we wasted all that fine Cincinnati material.  Damn it. 
[00:05:00]  We're not even there.  Mother S.  F.  S.  Concentrate on Columbus humor, and then maybe the ratings will go up.  Cincinnati, then.  Cincinnati in the hole.  You really thought we were in Cincinnati?  No.  I knew we were in Cincinnati.  No, you're lying.  No, I know, because I would make a WKRP joke, maybe.  What do I know?  Can you name ten of the cities we're syndicated to, Anthony?  Stop it!  Of course I can. 
[00:05:30]  You want me to?  Yeah.  I can.  No.  No, I'm not looking at that.  Don't help him.  I know we're in New York, obviously.  We're in Boston.  Right.  Sometimes we're in Washington.  No, we're not in Washington.  Yeah, we're in Washington.  We are in Cleveland.  We are in Columbus.  Uh-huh.  We are in Vegas.  Uh-huh.  We are in Nilems.  Uh-huh.  We are in Buffalo.  Uh-huh.  We are in Rochester. 
[00:06:00]  Uh-huh.  We are in Philly.  Uh-huh.  We are in Sacramento.  Uh-huh.  We are in Portland.  Uh-huh.  We are in...  Hold it.  Hold it.  Let me go through Chicago.  Uh-huh.  And Dallas.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  All right.  How many left?  You're almost there.  Three left?  Yep.  San Francisco?  Uh-huh.  All right.  Two left.  You have two left.  Twisty goose and two left.  Two left.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it.  Hold it. 
[00:06:30]  I'm working.  Working.  Damn it.  Let me go south a little.  Go that way.  I'm looking at the country in my head, in my mind's eye.  They're screaming at their radios right now.  Oh, go F yourselves then.  Seattle?  Oh, Seattle.  Yeah, right.  All right.  And the other one.  The other one?  Oh, I forgot about the other one.  Because we haven't received a call from them yet.  Who?  Austin.  Oh, Austin.  Are we on it, Austin?  The juice.  The juice! 
[00:07:00]  That's right.  We're on the juice.  Hello, the juice.  All right.  See?  Hey, come on.  I did good.  Okay, Anthony.  So, I think we're going to do this all day long today.  We're waiting for the first lady to show up for the litter box day.  Hey.  Remember that girl that said she would be here?  Yeah.  What time did we tell her to be here?  We told her to be here at 3 o'clock.  Once again, is it ladies messing up the radio show?  Ladies, look.  You've got to get down here.  Any word from the cat litter box lady? 
[00:07:30]  Nothing yet, but you never know.  You never know.  She swore she'd be here at 3.  We want girls to come down.  We have our little cat litter box set up.  And all you've got to do is, it's a new Motley Crue challenge.  We learned this from Vince Neil.  He would take the girls under the stage during the shows,  and they'd have a little cat box set up with scoopable litter.  And the girls would use the cat box.  For number one, don't worry.  You don't have to go bury in a big log. 
[00:08:00]  And, you know, we just want one of the girls,  at least one girl to come down and do this.  There is a DVD player.  First girl that does it will get the DVD player.  You'll get a beautiful DVD player.  The first girl that comes down and do this.  What a great gift that would make for some strapped girl.  Other incentives, there's a bunch of Ozzy Osbourne tickets up for grabs for others to come down.  Ozzy tickets.  This is like the first girl that comes down will get the DVD player.  And then you get an Ozzy ticket. 
[00:08:30]  Your choice of Ozzy tickets as a DVD player.  Yeah, whatever we have, because we've got to get rid of all our stuff before we leave for a week and a half.  So, all right?  Yeah.  First girl down, we'll get the DVD player.  Otis, what's up?  Hey, I'd like to give an early SU to Cleveland,  because those guys, thanks to them, we can't drink our bottled beer in Giant Stadium anymore.  Wait, they're taking the beer away in all the stadiums because of what happened in Cleveland?  I don't know, but they said Giant Stadium.  I thought that scene in Cleveland was awesome, by the way. 
[00:09:00]  I love mayhem at my sporting events.  Mayhem's great.  They have taken all the mayhem away from sporting events.  Bottle fight better than snowball fight?  Snowball fight at Giant Stadium a few years back was great.  Classic.  Big ice ball fight.  And then after that, they decide,  maybe we should clean the snow off the seats before we let them in.  We have lost the mayhem in sports.  When I was living in Buffalo and the Bills were making their Super Bowl.  We're on in Buffalo, Opie, by the way.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:09:30]  And they were making their Super Bowl run those four years.  Yeah.  And they would win the division title and stuff.  The freaking place would lose their effing minds.  They would rip the goalposts off the field.  That's mayhem.  And then they would pass it up the entire stadium and throw it over the top.  That's great.  And then you're driving home and guys are holding on for dear life to part of the goalposts walking down the highway.  And basically the last person still holding on gets the damn thing.  And there's pieces of that goalposts and all the bars all over Buffalo. 
[00:10:00]  Oh, yeah?  That's mayhem with your sports.  Yeah.  What happened in Cleveland?  That was awesome.  Yeah, but don't interfere with our drinking.  Come on.  Yeah, that's what starts the mayhem.  You need the drinking for the mayhem.  Of course.  They're just saying they're taking the bottled beer away or beer in general this weekend?  The bottled beer.  Now you have to have cups.  All right, but you still get the beer.  Yeah, but come on.  And aren't the bottles plastic?  They just look like plastic.  Well, they're plastic, but they still hurt a lot when they're full. 
[00:10:30]  Cups don't hurt.  That's true.  The full plastic, just as good as glass.  Hey, man, I don't blame Cleveland.  They got a raw deal there.  You know what they should ban from the NFL?  Well, bad officiating.  I'm glad the Cleveland fans did what they did.  They want to charge you 60 bucks a ticket and rape you for a hot dog and then call the  game horribly?  Good.  Throw bottles at them and they'll get it right.  Good for Cleveland.  There you go.  Good for Cleveland.  All right.  Cleveland can just suck it, okay?  All right.  Bye, fellas. 
[00:11:00]  Cleveland ruined it for everyone else this week.  Good for them.  Jeff has a comment about Columbus.  Jeff, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey, I'm...  You know, nobody listens to you guys in Columbus because nobody knows you guys are on.  I mean, I'm no freaking marketing whiz, you know, but maybe a couple of billboards and  some ads or something like that, you know, might help out your ratings a little bit.  Hmm.  Yeah, you got to promote the show.  Yeah, I mean, yeah, we do.  I mean...  We've learned that works.  What's that?  We've learned that works. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah.  When a station takes the show and then promotes it in other day parts, it helps.  It helps.  When they're excited about having the show and they promote it, sure.  I mean, the only way you guys are just by word of mouth, you know, I mean, and people  turn you on and listen to you, then they get hooked.  Oh, we love the word of mouth, but it takes forever.  We beg you guys to tell your friends all the time to listen to the show.  What?  Rick's got some news?  You guys are on one of those radio stations that doesn't have DJs either.  It's just one of the computer things, you know, and you just play songs.  So that kind of screws you, too. 
[00:12:00]  All right, Jeff.  Yeah, tell that guy from New York to screw himself, because you guys only be drinking  at those games anyway.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  What news?  Rick, you have some news?  Yes.  Litterbox Girl is here.  Oh, my God.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  For him, yeah.  Litterbox Girl is here.  Is she hot?  She's kind of cute, yeah.  Now we've got to run out and get the Litterbox.  I just said, man.  Ah, see how, see, you bitches, what happens?  See how much faith we have in you? 
[00:12:30]  We didn't even get the stuff.  We didn't even get the Litterbox or anything.  Does she know to get scoopable litter?  Uh, yeah.  Make sure it's not that.  See how much faith we put in the girls?  Oh, Norton, stop it.  Stop it.  Oh, he's toying with himself.  He's toying.  Norton, cut it out.  Look, he's grabbing.  Nothing, no, I'm just a little...  You are, you're squeezing your hands right down there.  Oh, I give a little helmet tickle for good measure.  This show's so weird.  We started with no energy. 
[00:13:00]  And look, the energy building...  Of course.  ...for the O&A show now.  Bobby from Queens says, I totally agree with Opie.  The only thing better would have been a full-blown British soccer riot.  Aren't those great just watching the Limeys and the French or whoever it is?  Just beating the living crap out of each other?  You don't understand.  I love mayhem with my sports.  With the Yankees and their run?  Yeah.  How much did it suck to see everyone just stand in their, you know, next to their seats,  clapping their hands and stuff?  The old days, they ran on the field and ripped the place apart. 
[00:13:30]  Well, now, you know, you get the amount of police out there.  They keep everything in line.  You're not supposed to run out.  Get the lunatics, you know, jumping in.  The celebration at the pitcher's mound.  While they're still running the bases.  Who was that running the bases?  Oh, the Hank Aaron.  Yeah.  And some tool is just, like, running around with them.  Hey, look at me.  Two guys, yeah.  Two guys.  But back in the old days, if you were really happy, you'd tear up a little piece of paper  and you'd throw it like confetti.  Yippee.  Go team. 
[00:14:00]  That's what they do now.  Our friend Doug from Springfield.  Yeah.  I'm a huge hockey fan, as you know, by now.  But, you know, the fights aren't as good as they used to be.  They don't goon it up like they used to be.  Doug from Springfield is getting me a tape.  It's like three hours of the best hockey fights ever.  I want to see this.  It'll be the best Christmas present I ever get.  When they're just holding each other with one hand.  All the bench clearing.  Roundhousing each other.  Just taking punch for punch.  Bench clearing crawls.  Yeah.  Which don't happen very often anymore because there's severe penalties if you leave the 
[00:14:30]  bench during fights.  Can't wait to get that.  I like the stick fights.  The stick fights?  Where they start out just swacking each other and then the gloves come off and they...  The gloves.  Walk.  Throw them down on the ground and then they just circle.  Kind of line each other up and then, bam, start punching.  Right.  Great.  The old days.  Before we take a break, and then we're going to get the lady in here for the cat litter box.  I can't believe we're going to pull this one off. 
[00:15:00]  Chris Overcash sent me a really long list that we edited.  He wrote a list of stuff.  Edited for adult content or adult situations?  Language?  Just so it flows better, Anthony.  He wrote a list of the things he learned in the past year on the O.P. Anthony show.  Yearly, what did we learn?  And I do believe other people are going to pick up on this and run with it and send theirs in as well.  That's great.  But this is Chris's list.  And if I remember correctly, because he says it in this email, he wrote the same list last year but didn't get it in in time. 
[00:15:30]  And we ended up reading it, like, when we got back from Christmas and it just wasn't as effective.  That's pretty stupid of him.  So he got in early.  So here it is.  This is what Chris learned on the O.P. and Anthony show this year.  O.P., also, topless bartender, is he here?  They have arrived?  They're here.  Where do we get the sluts from?  Oh, stop it until they serve something.  Wait until they come in.  They're getting wanded.  Oh, they're getting wanded.  Okay.  Cool.  Nice.  All right. 
[00:16:00]  This is what Chris learned on the O.P. and Anthony show this year.  When the Japanese Titanic hit a Riceburg, the Japs put on rife jackets and shot off freres.  I remember that.  Hillary took the Uck truck when she was in college.  It tastes like a mix between buttermilk and Clorox.  I was just looking at the box.  That's the box we're using?  That's old school, man.  What is that?  It's just a box that I found.  It's wooden.  You're going to have to line it with something because that scoopable litter is very thin.  We just throw it all out. 
[00:16:30]  No, because it'll come out on the floor.  Get a plastic bag.  You don't think so?  You can put sand.  You can put a little plastic on the bottom of it.  Or newspaper.  Print out a picture of Jim.  Just put a little newspaper on the bottom of that.  Go on the paper.  If she doesn't go in the box, can we roll up a newspaper and smack her in the nose?  Or just use your mule, Norton.  Of course.  Some more of the things that Chris learned in the past year on the O.P. and Anthony show.  XFL game day was not canceled.  It never existed. 
[00:17:00]  Back to you, Rusty.  Hello, hello, hello.  Antoinette never did get those concert tickets.  Gary Coleman is still on hold, Anthony.  Opie took a nap ski.  Opie shaves his junk.  Jews call them shwuggies.  Never open up the spackle buckets on a job site.  Right.  These are all the things we taught you guys in the past year, according to Chris.  Bobbing for dignity is the greatest term for oral ever.  Norton rules.  Lying Brian is a pirate.  That's intern Brian. 
[00:17:30]  We're going to replay that while we're away.  The time we found our intern lying to us.  Right.  Blatantly.  Blatantly.  Blatantly saying he was in a car accident and there was nothing wrong with him.  And it's so fun.  It made Stinky scared for his life.  Yes.  Stinky did not want to work with the kid anymore.  And we fired him on the spot.  It was a very sad day for him this past year.  Teen musical dildo chairs equals more gooder.  Jay Moore's wife likes to spank teenage girls.  Preteen is more gooder than teen. 
[00:18:00]  Jesus.  If there's grass on the field, play ball.  Turn Abner Louima's head sideways and his lips look like a puffy vag.  Only Ant's darts stuck in limo Anthony's back.  We will be rerunning that during break.  Yeah.  The first rule of Underwater Fight Club is you don't talk about Underwater Fight Club.  Black girl takes the Underground Railroad home every night.  Martian abortions prevent crimes.  Old dirty sperm are on jet skis. 
[00:18:30]  The body glitter on Ken Stevens came from Melissa.  Kimmy from Survivor did Kevin James.  And a mystery football player.  This is what Chris has learned in the past year listening to the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie got the chick fired.  Uncle Junior swings both ways, men and boys.  That's right, Tony.  The popular karaoke song at Bay Ridge, Brooklyn is Daddy's Home.  Angela, comment.  Opie's wife still hasn't been born yet.  That's not true.  My wife is now six months old somewhere. 
[00:19:00]  I wonder how she's doing.  Opie takes his blankie to the movies.  Steve C. won the Sopranos' death pool.  Foundry Music Daily Dump Sheet was fun while it lasted.  Dancing on the Ceiling is a popular song at Jewish weddings when the floor collapses.  Earl starred in Shrek this summer.  Ron Jeremy poked his fingers through Stalker Patty's rawhide.  The best place to hide E is in your snatch panties.  If Earl's the Fire Marshal O and A are screwed, it's usually A, not B. 
[00:19:30]  Usually, not always.  This is what Chris learned in the last year from our show.  If you don't laugh within the first 20 minutes, this probably isn't the show for you.  Right, Rick?  If you get the fisheye, don't even try to attempt the Roman war helmet.  It will take 1.7 niggawatts to get black to the future.  Or, pedophiles love Cheez-Its.  Stinky's roommate, comment.  Oh, boy.  Supercuts with an N thrown in somewhere described soccer moms in minivans.  Supercuts?  Cuts!  I know, that's what I said. 
[00:20:00]  I'm just thinking, snooper cuts?  Why?  I don't care.  Ken Stevens is one of Opie's gay friends.  Starker Patty now looks like a bald aunt.  How can someone without motion be in promotions?  Earl, comment.  When getting the backdoor sex, can I say that?  They won't dump out of that, right?  When getting the backdoor sex, don't use lube.  Take it like a champ.  Three goalies equals retard table.  Eddie Trunk should call Rush Limbaugh for a new pointing job. 
[00:20:30]  Dice is being sued by Hanson.  Starker Patty is really just a clever disguise for Super Lady.  Opie is 4-0 when it comes to taints.  The new pills that make your stuff taste like cherries gives Rick even more incentive to taste his own stuff.  Bag!  Marion's maxi pad looks like an airplane pillow.  If you poke a duck in the boob with a golf club, you'll get smacked in the head.  Washington listeners are leaving like the Taliban from Kabul.  According to the equation, the WNEW studios are now 6.5 miles south of Ground Zero. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  He did the math, and it's right, by the way.  Jim Norton will be at the Fun House in Poughkeepsie, New York, on New Year's Eve.  Nice!  You whore!  And finally, you could spend New Year's Eve with Rich Voss at Caroline's, ringing the New Year with old jokes.  But I love the guy.  So that's from Chris Overcash with some of the things that he learned on the Opie and Anthony show this year.  Bravo!  Good luck!  Wow, he might as well have taken a college course.  Right.  With all that he learned. 
[00:21:30]  Well, they're teaching the Simpsons in college now, Anthony.  That was a big story.  That's great.  Yeah.  Pay all kinds of money so your kid could go to college to learn about the Simpsons.  Right.  All right.  Nothing compared to John the Intern's college courses that he was talking Jeremy's ear off about.  Oh, God.  We'll talk about Intern John next and his little college paper that he wrote.  Yeah.  We're all over his college paper and he got everything wrong.  Where is the paper, by the way?  Do we have it here?  Let me glance over this thing. 
[00:22:00]  A lot of people requested ding fries are done.  We're going to do that after break.  We've got to get into commercials here.  When we come back, the lady will be in to do the cat litter box thing.  We've got topless bartenders, more of your phone calls, more of your instant feedback.  So stay there.  There's a car that's around next to me.  Whip out your cans.  Pull out your fun bags.  What are you waiting for?  Do it.  Do it now.  I'm rolling.  You look fabulous.  Opie and Anthony.  We love seeing boobs. 
[00:22:30]  Well done.  Hey, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  One of the hottest songs of the past year, Ant.  Yeah.  Alien Ant Farm, Smooth Criminal.  A lot's going on on the show.  Before the next break, we will play Ding, Fries Are Done.  A lot of people want to get it on tape, so get your cassettes ready, all right?  Also playing What Did We Learn on the Opie and Anthony show this year. 
[00:23:00]  Kevin from D.C.  This year I learned Crinkle, Crinkle, Always Funny.  Lou from Jersey.  The most important thing that I learned this year is that out of the Olsen Twins, Ashley  is the goer.  Yeah.  Erniel from Jersey.  This year I learned best new character, Neil Diamond.  There are a lot of new characters on the show this year, Anthony.  Erniel was saying the best one, though, Neil Diamond. 
[00:23:30]  Oh, likes to Neil.  Hand myself to no one else in America.  My fave is Pejoria Kid.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Police got my car.  Police got my car.  We'll be playing that today, Phil.  Police got my car in America.  They come into America in my car. 
[00:24:00]  It's an original.  Yeah, sure it is.  By Neil.  Danielle from Alabama, Syndication Underground.  I learned this year that Otto and George are always funnier on best-ofs when everything  is bleeped out and you can actually understand the jokes.  That is so true.  Here's my other new one.  Holy crap, it's Christmas.  Jay Moore is afraid of dice, and Sandy Kane gets more disgusting every appearance.  Gil from Staten Island.  I learned that three rights make a left. 
[00:24:30]  You did learn that.  And Gator Man from Long Island.  Um, is it too gay to have your girlfriend strap on a blank and do you from, uh...  Right, that way.  We've talked about that in the past year.  Yeah, very gay.  Well, a lot of guys called in and said it wasn't, though.  Gay, gay, gay.  We don't need to go there, because we got a girl ready to come in the studio and do something  very outrageous for us.  Yes.  Before, though, we have a counter-FU, Anthony, about to happen.  If you were listening about 20 minutes ago, a Giants fan called in and said FU to 
[00:25:00]  Cleveland, because of Cleveland and them throwing all their, uh, beer on the field, they can't  have bottled beer at, uh, at, uh, Giant Stadium this weekend.  Yeah, that's insane.  So the FU went out to Cleveland, the state, the city itself.  Yep.  Now, uh, Jay from Cleveland has a counter-FU, Anthony.  Yes, Jay.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Uh, I just want to sign the counter-FU to Earl, because first off, we realize the only  pussies drink bottled from beer.  Second, it proves that Cleveland has the best fans in all of the NFL. 
[00:25:30]  I agree.  Yeah, you take your sports pretty seriously.  I like that.  That's for sure.  I like the Mayhem.  Very nice.  That's right.  Look at the nickel beer rate in 76.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  No problem.  Bye.  You gotta love Cleveland.  That's sticking up for Cleveland.  You gotta love Cleveland fans.  Oh, here it is.  The Samsung DVD player.  DVD player.  This is great.  You know, when we had that meeting with the, the suits from Samsung.  I remember that.  I don't think they envisioned that their product would be given away in this fashion, Anthony. 
[00:26:00]  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Well, this is great.  Why don't we meet the girl?  We can meet the girl.  Why don't we meet the, the, uh, young lady who's gonna be doing the, uh, Motley Crue,  the newest Motley Crue challenge.  She's hot, too, man.  Yeah, every time someone from Motley Crue comes in, we get a, a new bit to do on our radio  show.  So, at this point, all we have to say is, girl, litter box, for some reason, he's not  letting us say litter box.  What?  It doesn't make sense, you dick. 
[00:26:30]  You dick.  It doesn't make friggin' sense.  Litter box, litter box, litter box.  We're not allowed to say.  It's a litter box.  We're not saying anything else.  You cool.  Get Jeremy in here immediately.  Immediately.  Wow, I love it.  Get Jeremy in here.  Who is it?  Right now.  This is gonna be cool.  Cause he's gotta bang that guy's friggin' head in with a hammer.  He's making up rules as they go along, and they're retarded ridiculous.  We just gotta know.  Jeremy!  Where is he? 
[00:27:00]  Rachel just went to get him.  We just, uh, what, we just received a note, we can't say that?  Rick holds up a note.  That's why you were distracted over it?  Yes!  Holy crap!  Oh my god, hi.  You're gonna scare her off.  No, no, no.  Nothing scares me.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  The cat's in the studio.  In the silver spoon.  Little boy blue in the...  Wait, that's not me.  And the box with sand in it is in the corner.  There you go. 
[00:27:30]  Christ on a pony!  Where's Jeremy?  Chop chop!  I want Jeremy here immediately.  They're already sweating down the hall.  I have some questions for you.  They have a feeling we're going to blow it up today, Anthony, so this isn't going to help matters.  His...  You know what it is?  His reasoning takes a chain of thought that is retarded.  It's like saying, don't say, um, hamburger.  Why?  Because if you eat a hamburger and it works its way through your digestive system, it comes 
[00:28:00]  out as the word you can't say.  So don't say food!  Jeremy.  Could you grab that mic, please?  We have to hash this out on the air or I'm going to have a goddamn seizure.  Craig.  Right.  In his ultimate wisdom, in the dump room, which we should have a button here that releases  Zylon B gas, Zyklon B gas into that goddamn room.  Can't we put the dump guy in the box today?  Yeah. 
[00:28:30]  So, Craig, you know what we want to do?  You know what we want to do?  We have a room that protects us, right?  We have a girl.  Right.  We have a box.  Right.  That is usually used by a feline.  Cool.  She has a name, Anthony.  I'm saying on the floor, I wasn't talking about the lovely lady.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry.  Now, he's saying, for some bizarre reason that I cannot even comprehend, that we cannot  say kitty litter.  Okay.  Why can we not say kitty litter? 
[00:29:00]  We're not even going to...  You know something?  You will not even hear mention of what this kitty litter box is being used for.  You will not even hear it.  I'll tell you...  Why it's being used.  If you want, off the air, we can have a quick powwow about it and then decide.  Off the air.  Great.  Great.  Well, I don't know all the facts.  I have to do an investigation.  We don't have time for that crap.  There's a girl here and we have the box and we're ready to go and she's time constrained. 
[00:29:30]  Yeah, she's got to leave in about 10 minutes.  Why don't you...  Can you go down and have a powwow?  Right.  With Craig.  And then we will talk to her a little bit and then when you come back, yeah, yeah, let  me know why it has to be that way or that we can go along and say kitty litter.  That sounds like fun.  I'll go do that.  All right.  Give that a try.  Bye-bye.  Do you want a hammer to hit him with?  Please?  No?  Well, let's say hi to the ladies. 
[00:30:00]  Craig's doing a good job.  Ah, okay.  I'm very proud of Craig.  Very good.  Give him a cookie then.  Yeah.  Why don't you have to hire a Mormon to do the dump box?  The dump button.  Okay.  What's your name?  That's still a good joke.  Dump box.  That's a verb.  Lauren, hi.  Sorry I was so emotional but I'm very excited about this.  Not in the way Norton is.  Lauren, you're not scared of us at this point, are you?  No.  Okay.  No.  Now, you know what we would like you to do.  Have you ever done anything like this before? 
[00:30:30]  Uh, no.  No?  Nice.  Interesting.  You're not a shy girl or anything?  Not particularly.  Not particularly.  I've gone in the woods before.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You've done that in the woods.  That's good.  In the wooden, is it?  What?  What'd she do?  We're so vague, I don't know.  She did that in the woods.  What?  Smoked pot?  What?  Did it in the woods.  Had sex?  I don't know.  Yeah, that could be.  I don't know.  See?  Ate a hamburger?  Could be.  Read a book.  Very vague.  I think she ate a hamburger in the woods.  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  Don't say that.  All of the above.  Yeah.  All of the above. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  And what, is it the great Samsung DVD player prize that you're doing this for?  Is it some freeing experience?  I didn't even know there was a prize.  Oh, really?  You just, now, are you doing this because you're a fan of the show?  Yeah.  We talked about it on the air, and she contacted us.  That is beautiful.  She was very thrilled by the idea.  Yeah.  Does it give you a little excitement, a little nervousness, a little butterflies?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  How do you feel about the fact that Norton is very, very excited about this? 
[00:31:30]  I don't know.  You don't know?  Is he scaring you?  He kind of looks like the Gerber baby.  Oh, wow!  That's a coincidence, because he's been with the Gerber baby.  Wow!  That's going to be on your website immediately.  The Gerber baby.  Oh, jeez.  That is, you nailed it.  You nailed it.  You think on obanthony.com you're going to see a picture of Norton's head and the Gerber  baby separated at birth?  Could you be more subtle with a hint? 
[00:32:00]  We want to see it.  That's why.  We want to see it immediately before we go on our Christmas vacation.  Yes.  Our boyfriend's outside.  He's a big boy.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  What does he think about this?  He's the one that told me to call in.  Yeah?  Does he watch sometimes?  Yeah.  He watches?  There's certain things that, you know, watching ain't bad.  That's how it all starts.  That ain't bad.  Believe me.  You think I didn't start that way?  Yeah, let me just watch.  The next thing you know, get a Chardonnay glass. 
[00:32:30]  Please.  That's how it starts.  Nobody just dives in and hides the bowl.  We're talking about wine now?  Yeah.  Yeah, a little bit of a wine, Chardonnay.  Right, sure.  Sure.  To prevent Cardinal Egan from dumping out.  Wow, they sure have been gone a long time.  Well, because...  Jeremy's...  Because he still has to dump the show while Jeremy discusses it.  While he's talking.  Ah, there you go. 
[00:33:00]  That must be...  You've got to do two things at once.  All right.  Well, have you been drinking a lot?  Nope.  No?  Do you feel any...  I drank a whole bottle of water on the way down.  That was it.  Are you feeling, and let's just say this, any urges?  I was when I came...  Oh, look at our show.  I don't.  Wow, look at you.  Because I know.  I know.  Jack off.  Look at you show a responsibility.  I was being responsible.  You know something?  For our radio show.  This very finger that hit that dumb button a year ago, it wasn't that smart. 
[00:33:30]  I yelled at this very pointer finger for hours and days on end because of last year.  Between Christmas and New Year's.  Yes, I did.  Jeremy is back.  I would love to hear this.  What are we...  We have discussed it at great length.  Yeah.  And have found a way for you to be able to say that thing...  Okay.  ...on the radio.  Oh, I'm sure this is going to be great.  What is it?  No, that's it. 
[00:34:00]  The only thing that you can't do is this thing I have written on the piece of paper.  Let me see.  Okay, let me see.  Oh, no, you wrote it out.  Let me see.  He wrote it.  I love this.  I love this.  Let's see.  All right.  See, that...  Hold on.  Let me see.  That's a big problem.  Let me see.  Why?  Wait, let me see.  Well, let me see first.  Don't take Rick's word for it.  It's a big problem.  Let me see.  I'm not going to show it to you if it's a big problem.  Son of a bitch, Rick.  Son of a bitch, Rick.  Son of a bitch on the air.  All right, let me see.  No, let me see.  I got to see it.  Oh, the kids might be...  No.  No, we kind of knew that. 
[00:34:30]  No, what?  No, we knew that.  No.  Oh, we knew that.  Rick.  We already agreed to that, right?  God damn it, Rick.  Well, then, great.  I had a curse just to watch Jeremy's face when I said the F word.  You know, I didn't even notice it for a second because I'm so used to saying that.  We all say it.  We love that word.  You guys, Ken Stevens is sweating profusely down the hall.  I know he is.  He just knows we're going to blow this up today.  No, no, no.  Okay, that's fine. 
[00:35:00]  Good.  And there'll be no graphic descriptions of anything and everything will be fine.  Good.  We just know that there's a box full of kitty litter.  All I know is we got a girl and a box of kitty litter.  And a DVD player.  There you go.  And she's ready to win it.  And if our listeners can't figure it out from here, then go F yourself.  She's going to eat the sand?  Yeah.  All right, good.  Have a nice time.  Bye-bye.  Thank you, Jeremy Coleman.  And there he goes.  Could you thank Gandhi when you go back there? 
[00:35:30]  Gandhi.  I know.  Jerry Falwell.  All right.  What a goody two-shoes.  Well, Ed, we should take a break and we'll do it next.  How's that?  Yes, we will.  Because you wasted all the time.  I wasted nothing.  Hey, God damn it.  I stood my ground and we made some headway.  Okay.  Okay.  As we go to break, a lot of people want to get this on tape.  So why don't we do this now, okay?  Mm-hmm.  A song called Ding Fries Are Done.  There you go. 
[00:36:00]  A song that is played every year on hundreds of radio stations across America.  Can't take credit for this one, Anthony.  Here it is.

It's kind of refreshing, right?  I don't see anything, Rick.  It's tasty.  It's very tasty.  It's very nice.  I like it.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Sunday afternoon, me and Vols are trying to hook up with this chick from the gym.  We didn't know her husband was standing right next to us.  I know.  I'm going, look.  What happened?  There's this girl working out.  Beautiful. 
[01:08:00]  I'm standing next to Doug.  I'm going, look how fine she is, how hot she is.  Right?  And she walks by.  I go, you know, I'm hitting on her, and her husband is right next to Doug on the other side.  And I said to the guy, she's got some wreck, doesn't she?  I know.  He looked right at my face and didn't say a word.  I'm like, what the hell is with this guy?  Huh.  And it was the husband?  It was the husband.  Wow.  Yeah.  And then Vols said to the guy, you know, I'm a comedian.  She said.  No, she is.  That was a comic.  She said to you, I was a comic.  She said, you don't look like one.  Oh, okay.  And I said in the back, he doesn't sound like one either. 
[01:08:30]  Oh, look at Doug.  Nah, you're.  Didn't you be doing somebody's hair right now?  I just finished.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  What does he do?  He's a hairdresser.  I own a hair salon.  I told you.  He's a hair salon.  Doug.  Doug, you own a hair salon?  Yeah.  Why?  Yeah, why?  You just don't look like the type, that's all.  Well, what type do I look like?  You look like a tough guy.  What are you saying, Opie?  A tough guy.  Are you saying he's a faggot?  No, I'm not.  Is that what you said?  Opie, you said that really?  Hold on, Doug.  No, I didn't.  Because I saw you.  Oh, what am I supposed to look like?  Hold on!  I am stopping this. 
[01:09:00]  You're stereotyping right there.  Oh, damn.  I can't believe he's calling you a faggot.  I look like a hairstyle.  What am I supposed to look like?  No, I didn't say you look like a hairstyle.  You said you don't look like a hairstyle.  It's the same thing.  Hey, dude.  No, I'm not getting my hockey tapes, Anthony.  No, I got your hockey tapes.  When you're applying moose, do you aim it for your face?  No.  What kind of hockey tapes do you get in them?  Field hockey or the real hockey?  No, hockey fights.  Oh, really?  The good ones.  When all mayhem broke out on the ice.  Yeah, the good old days.  Not the pussy fights we have today.  So you're stereotyping me now.  I can't believe you really said that. 
[01:09:30]  Dude, you don't look like a guy that would own a hair salon.  Well, what does that mean?  I don't understand you.  You don't look like a tough guy.  When you came in and drove the hell out of Earl, I was a little scared.  Is that the guy?  That's the guy!  That red-faced Irish maniac owns a hair salon?  That's what I'm saying!  Irish maniac.  I'm full of tain, I hate to tell you.  You look Irish, though.  You just look like one of those angry dudes from, you know, Hell's Kitchen.  He looks just like my cousin Ricky, actually.  So, Opie, just do me a favor.  Explain it.  Does that mean there's a gay guy somewhere pouring cement? 
[01:10:00]  So you say, I don't look like a hairstylist.  Now, just explain.  What does that mean?  Seriously.  I think that was a compliment.  Hold on.  We can't hold on.  What does that mean?  Boyfriend calling?  Oh, yeah.  Shut up.  I need my hockey fight tapes.  All right, Doug.  Take it easy, guys.  Merry Christmas.  There he goes.  Doug's a good guy.  Twinkle toes, I think they call him.  He is scary, man.  I see him in the gym all the time.  He does absolutely nothing there.  He's one of those guys who sit there.  The walk around the gym, guys?  Yeah.  Wait, Doug.  Hi, ladies.  The other girl wants to say something. 
[01:10:30]  Did you talk yet?  Did you talk yet?  That's all you want to say?  Who's Christy?  Please say lesbian lover.  No.  Cousin?  Oh, all right.  Sorry.  Hey, dude, can I?  Hold on.  Right?  Just because of the mic.  Yes, Jim?  I just wanted to really quick thank all the people, man, that contacted me yesterday.  They said that we announced that website yesterday, and 20,000 people hit it.  Wow.  So, a lot of emails.  Just thanks, guys.  I really appreciate it.  Wow.  Yeah, it's not even 20,000 hits.  20,000 people.  So, thank you for all the emails and stuff. 
[01:11:00]  And what's the website again?  Eatabullet.com.  And you can link to Voss's site.  You have the most miserable picture of me on your website.  Oh, dude, you look like you're ready just to commit a murder.  It's great.  While we're talking about websites, you have to check it out.  Oh, here it comes.  They're allowed to say whatever they want.  They're talking.  I know.  Oh, partybynines.com for Bacardi.  What's that?  You'll check out our events and stuff that we're doing.  No topless pictures, though.  Okay.  Hey, Voss, so you try picking up women at health clubs, just like you try to pick up women at strip clubs?  What are you talking about at strip clubs? 
[01:11:30]  Anthony, Voss is the guy that we talk about on this show.  What do you mean?  Convinced he's got a shot with strippers.  Oh, no.  You're the guy.  Before you even start this, hold on.  I hear, Norton, I'm sorry to inform you of this, 10,000 of those hits was just Voss wanting to see his link.  It's sad.  It's so sad.  Now, Voss, you think when you go into a strip club, you're the guy that thinks he has a shot with his strippers?  We have a witness, my friend. 
[01:12:00]  Who?  Who's the witness?  First of all.  Wait, the hot one wants to...  One of the hot ones, I can say.  You're all hot.  What do you want to say?  Mwah.  Oh.  It's just a rocket scientist.  I have a lot in common with her.  Listen, when I went to the strip club...  Be nice.  He's just learning how to speak.  When I went to the strip club the other night, sometimes you can tell when you're talking to a girl...  Shut up!  Oh, my God.  Stop right there.  Cut your losses.  You're not perceptive.  Oh, my God.  Let's hear the end of that sentence. 
[01:12:30]  Listen, you can tell when they're working you or when they're not working you.  Don't you think so?  No, you can't.  They're always working you.  Yeah, she was a hooker, but she made eye contact.  What are you talking about?  You're convinced that the girls actually like you in the strip club.  No, no, not the girls.  No, of course not.  One girl.  The guys?  One girl.  What are you talking about?  No, maybe the one girl I was talking to.  One girl.  How much money did you spend on her?  I saw him.  I watched him talking to this hot girl, and she's sipping his champagne, and I'm like, 
[01:13:00]  if this dummy bought her a lady's drink, I'm going to punch him.  And I talked to him later.  He was like, I was doing good.  I gave her my card.  And I'm like, what about the drink?  He said, well, I bought her a drink.  It was $15.  I'm like, that's why she spoke to you.  You bought a lady's drink.  Listen, okay, that's where you're wrong, because I sat and talked to her for 45 minutes.  Don't you think she could have made more money doing dancing?  No, because they were all just sitting around.  No, they were all doing dancing.  Okay, here's the bet.  And I gave her my card. 
[01:13:30]  Like, what is she going to do?  The card.  Take it.  Any of you ladies stripped before?  No one's dancing?  No?  We want to get a point of view.  Okay.  I used to work in strip clubs.  You used to work in strip clubs?  So you know the girls and stuff and the way they are.  I used to work in the guys.  Definitely.  I help them.  I used to help them.  Really?  Yeah.  And they like when the guys order them those fancy drinks and stuff and champagne.  Yeah, that costs 15 bucks.  You know what?  Really good, actually.  Bacardi Limon has a policy. 
[01:14:00]  If she's drinking a $15 drink, it better be right out of my mule.  Boss, how much time did you waste?  Champagne with a hip chaser.  How much time did you waste on the stripper?  I wish I had time.  I sat and talked to her.  How long?  Waste.  How long?  I don't know.  40 minutes, maybe?  And what did you get in the end?  Phone number?  Got a phone number, right?  No, you know what I do?  Here's what I do.  See, I'm not like these guys that, oh, I got a phone number.  I give them my number because if they call, then you know they're interested. 
[01:14:30]  Well, sure.  Oh, yeah.  And has she called you?  It's only been two days.  I said it.  I said next week to call me, to come see me next week.  Work.  Right?  I'll tell you what.  If she calls me, if she calls me, you guys are wrong on this one, okay?  All right.  No problem.  She might ask you just to mail her some cash, you idiot.  She didn't like you.  I watched him.  You watched the whole scene, right?  Dude, I've dated dancers and ex-dancers.  I'm telling you, they're working you.  And it's great watching him lean in like they're having a meaningful moment while she sips $15 champagne. 
[01:15:00]  I gave her my card.  $15 champagne?  You spent $3,000 on lap dances.  What's $15?  But I know they hate my guts.  That's one of the things I like about it.  Like, you sit there, go ahead, rub it on there.  Bye-bye.  I know they're not interested in me.  That turns me on.  You're scaring the girls.  All right.  I'm not.  Listen.  And they usually don't get this pretty in the studio.  They're very hot, these three girls.  Let me amine to them.  The one girl is giving you a look.  She's scared.  That doesn't matter.  You all right with him?  I'm fine.  Yes.  All right.  All right.  She's a little horrified. 
[01:15:30]  Why?  I'm not saying anything mean.  I just.  Okay.  I'm not a pro at the dance club.  What's up, ladies?  Danny, what's up?  Listen.  Before you hang up, I got to complain about the show.  We're not doing that today.  We're in a good mood, my friend.  Ha-ha.  He wanted to say that.  He wanted to say you girls are hot.  Yeah.  Did he?  Yeah.  Yeah.  But he wanted to add in an insult first.  Well, your body's all over the stinky cam.  Don't slouch, though.  Well, we have a good look.  Here you go.  Don't slouch.  Because then the bad email's going to come in.  I know, but you know what? 
[01:16:00]  Talk into the money.  No, that's great.  Every picture has to go on this thing now.  Right there.  Well, it updates every, like, 12 seconds.  It's cool.  Wow.  Wait.  It's quick.  I got a tiny.  Oh, my God.  Why don't you.  Yeah, hello to some people.  Then pull that down.  Show it, God damn it.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Yeah, how about that?  No one wants to see, uh.  Rick, your arm is in dumper view.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Wow.  Come on.  Let's take a cam.  All right.  Let's go to Bill.  Bill, what's up?  Hey, Bill.  Yeah.  What's up?  Nothing.  I want to talk about, uh, Dave Schultz beats the crap out of some guy. 
[01:16:30]  Uh.  That looks like, uh, like Schwarzkopf wants to beat the crap out of, uh, Bin Laden.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Uh, thanks, Bill.  You're talking about the, the hockey fight tape.  Yeah, Dave Schultz from the Flyers beats the snot out of some guy from Edmonton.  All right.  I can't wait.  I can't wait to see that tape.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  Everyone's starting their parties a little early, I think, uh.  I, I do believe, yeah. 
[01:17:00]  Yeah.  Well, John, the intern's on the line here.  Oh, thank goodness.  John?  Oh, hey.  What's up, guys?  Hey.  How you doing?  We finally read your term paper.  Was it horrific?  Huh?  Was it horrific?  Horrific?  Yeah.  Um.  Did you get a grade on the paper yet?  No, no, not horrific.  I'll be receiving the grade in about an hour, actually.  I have the class of 545.  Well, let us know how you do.  Um, if I was scoring it on accuracy, I would have to give you an F.  An F.  You got.  On Opie and Anthony show history accuracy, I give you an F. 
[01:17:30]  Uh-oh.  Here's what happened.  He did a whole, uh, what do you call this these days?  Uh, term paper?  A term paper.  What do I know?  On the, an examination of the shock format in talk radio.  Ugh.  Yeah, I knew that was coming.  Did you run your fingers through that awful perm while you were writing it?  Oh, God.  Oh, my God.  Sean Holmes, 1971 head. 
[01:18:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Not that bad.  So, uh, he, he wanted to interview, uh, me and Opie for this, uh, paper.  And we're like, okay, what the hell?  We kept putting it off, and then it's like, ah, screw it.  And he did roll tape, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I have the tape.  So, the first thing we said is, oh, are you going to ask us how we got together to do  the show?  Because, as a joke, because everyone asks that.  It's the same story.  If you want to know that, you can pick up 18,000 publications we've been in and read 
[01:18:30]  how, uh, it became the Opie and Anthony show from the Opie show when he was at BAB, uh,  on Long Island.  Yeah.  You didn't ask it because, I guess we assumed you knew it, and we had told you that it was  everywhere.  And he says, no, no, no.  He goes, I know.  I know.  That's why he didn't ask.  Right.  Well, you got it completely wrong.  Uh-oh.  What, what, what exactly was wrong?  I thought I was pretty accurate.  Read from his term paper. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, right.  Opie and Anthony began their careers in a very different way.  Greg Opie Hughes.  Ooh, wow.  You got something on me, John.  My real name.  Wow.  Began his radio career in earnest.  In earnest.  What is, what does that, uh, mean there?  In earnest.  Why did you throw that in there?  Why did you throw in earnest there?  Is earnest a program director?  I think earnest was just in seriousness and seriously, uh,  pursuing success. 
[01:19:30]  Ah, there you go.  Oh, so.  And I'm skipping through life with my shoelaces untied.  So, the ten years I spent on radio before BAB was just me goofing off, right?  Well, no, not necessarily, but.  Yeah, it began in earnest as an evening DJ on Long Island Station BAB.  So, after doing it ten or eleven years, I decided to take it seriously.  Zen was in earnest.  Right.  All the stations before.  Right.  Ernest does radio.  You tore.  Ernest does radio.  Hey, Vern, I'm on the radio.  Right.  All right.  In earnest.  During his show at night, the station's air conditioning was being repaired. 
[01:20:00]  Wrong.  Try again, dumbass.  Dude.  How do you think Ant and I got together, John?  I thought it was, I thought it was something along the lines, I believe I read it somewhere,  that Ant was doing ten-nogging at BAB, and he submitted a gun electric shock OJ to your  show on BAB.  He came in to play it live, and you guys got along, right? 
[01:20:30]  Well, put that in your paper.  Yeah, but he wasn't working on the air conditioning.  He wasn't working on the air conditioning at BAB.  Here it is.  He goes, during the night show, the station's air conditioning was being repaired.  One of the maintenance crew submitted a song for the contest Hughes was running.  Oh, boy.  The name was gun electric shock OJ.  The repairman, Anthony Cumia, submitted this song.  I'm like the Maytag repairman.  I'm going there, and I'm dropping tapes on Opie's head as he's working, and I'm crawling 
[01:21:00]  through ductwork.  One of the maintenance crew.  I was the maintenance crew for BAB.  You were one of the maintenance crew.  No.  They were all very talented, but you had the most talent.  Jesus Christ.  It goes into nothing about how, you know, I'd spent years writing music and song parodies.  No, I just threw a tape together and dropped it on Opie's head while I pushed a vent out  in the studio, like Mission Impossible.  While I was spinning a Jethro Tull record. 
[01:21:30]  Jethro Tull record, and finally going into a career in radio in earnest.  In earnest.  You have to goof it off for 12 years.  You know something?  I was looking for Ernest to give that tape to.  I saw Opie, and I thought he was Ernest.  Jesus Christ.  The chemistry between Hughes and Cumia was readily apparent, and the two got married in  September.  And the two began doing a regular show together.  I mean...  And what year did we get fired from Boston, John?  Ah, what year did we get fired? 
[01:22:00]  These are probably one of the biggest radio stories ever.  Right.  And it was written in numerous papers.  This is basically going to a knowledge...  I bet you some of the new cities even know the answer to that.  Yep.  I have a feeling it's not 96 like I put in the paper.  Well, you put 95 in the paper.  Okay.  So it's not...  And it was 98.  Okay.  I will make that...  What's three years when you're not really earnest?  Right.  95.  He says we got fired.  We got hired in 90... 
[01:22:30]  You got it all wrong.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Our wise-ass listeners want it.  Hold on.  Thank God.  Hold on.  Somebody better have something to say about us.  You're hot.  Sorry.  I'll tell you.  Instant feedback's coming in.  Let's get all the girls on the stinky cat.  All the guys think you are so hot.  Oh, the one doesn't want...  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Okay.  No?  Oh, well.  Boyfriend listening.  Yep.  I know how that can be.  Well, that's okay.  We got a lovely girl up here right now.  Very nice.  Move those fuzzy dice in the cup, could you please? 
[01:23:00]  Andrew, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, John got it all wrong.  This is how you met.  Opie was walking down the street with some peanut butter, and Anthony had some chalk, and you bumped  into each other.  I got it right.  I got chocolate in his peanut butter, and I got peanut butter in his chocolate.  Yeah.  You're a tool, man.  Take it easy.  That's funny.  Very good.  All right.  Let's go back to John.  That's good, Voss.  Just sit and move the hot chick over.  That's smart.  That's smart.  There's a hot chick sitting next to me, and he comes back in and just takes the seat. 
[01:23:30]  He needs to sit next to you.  He sits next to you every night at the Comedy Cellar, but he needs to sit next to you in  the studio today.  All right.  Anything else about John's paper?  That's pretty much it.  Then he goes on to, John, you're supposed to have this graded in an hour?  It's graded already.  I'll get the grade back in an hour, yeah.  Did you wake the teacher up that was grading it?  The professor?  No?  No.  He's probably long asleep.  You might have to do that.  Yeah, probably.  It is pretty boring, isn't it?  Not very exciting. 
[01:24:00]  I was trying to read some of it, but I got past the first part.  Now, do you understand you should have maybe looked into some of the facts a little better?  Yes, I assumed a little too much there.  There you go.  I'm sorry.  Did you have fun at Paisano's last night discussing your ideas about radio to Jeremy Coleman, the  PD?  Yeah, we talked about pie charts.  It was quite cool, actually.  Pie charts.  He's talking about pie charts and what he's learning in school about broadcasting.  Pie charts never work.  All right, John. 
[01:24:30]  Well, good luck to you.  All right.  Norton, anything you'd like to say in parting to John, the intern, today?  Drink a bottle of Bacardi.  Oh, a Bacardi.  And write a paper.  Getting in on the action.  I just hung up on John.  He's done, Anthony.  He's pouring out.  He really does.  The city's going at it today, and Otis wants in.  Otis?  Hey, this is Otis, the guy with the bottles earlier.  He's a big FU to San Francisco for inventing the Hiv.  I didn't invent the Hiv.  They're going at it now, Anthony. 
[01:25:00]  Here's another one for Voss's dad's penis, a.k.a. the hack shooter.  Right back in he comes.  Pete wants in.  Pete, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, guys.  You should rename the show Ernest and the Maintenance Man.  Yeah.  Ernest and the Maintenance Man.  Hey, I got a story for that tool Voss about a stripper in Anthony's favorite spot, the 
[01:25:30]  Tender Trap.  This girl asked me for my card.  I gave her my card and called me the next day.  Oh, I want to hang out with you, this, that.  I go up there like two days later.  She hangs out with me for like five minutes, goes, oh, I want to come dance for you.  She takes me over to a regular chair, sits me down, dances for me for about three minutes  and then wants 60 bucks.  I set you up.  Yep.  Just like him.  Should have got full service, dude.  I walked out.  I didn't give her anything.  I walked out of there.  Yeah, but you got to know when they're calling you like that, they're escorts, which is fine, 
[01:26:00]  but you just got to know that.  All right.  So she called you and then the next time you saw her at the bar?  Yeah.  She came up.  I was sitting down.  She came up to me.  Because now you're friends.  Now you're friends.  It's like, hey, come here, sit in this chair.  I'll give you a dance.  And you're like, oh, it's a freebie because now we're pals.  Exactly.  And you sit down, do it, and she goes, 60 bucks.  Three minutes.  Not even one song.  If she called you to hang out, why didn't you get her back to your place?  Why did you go back in there to hang out?  Because I was working that night and I just happened to be in that area. 
[01:26:30]  Oh, is that the way you do it, Voss?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, if they call and say, let's hang out, you're not going to go to where she  works.  Right.  You're going to go, you know, take her out to a nice place, you know, like great papayas  or something good, you know.  These are cool.  I was not.  You shove a hot dog down her throat and bang her while she's puking.  Thank you, Pete.  All right, guys.  All right, so we got the topless bartenders here from Bacardi Anthony.  Uh-huh.  You think any more ladies will show up for the litter box? 
[01:27:00]  Oh.  What do we do?  What were you guys going to tell us?  Oh, this is like a thing.  This is so great.  Filthy.  Filthy.  Hey, potty mouth.  Filthy.  Let her.  No, no, no.  Don't say it anymore.  Don't say that anymore.  It's not that.  Just sit there looking beautiful, okay?  Stop.  Oh.  No.  Can't say it.  Say it.  Oh, my God.  Don't say anything that has to do with it.  We're responsible broadcasters. 
[01:27:30]  If you keep saying it.  Wait, I turned your mic off.  Oh, my God.  Everyone's mic is off.  I had to turn off all the mics that were close to the top list.  We're in emergency mode.  We're in emergency mode.  We lost all our delay.  Hold on.  We lost.  Yeah, we have no more delay because the girls are talking about something they shouldn't be talking about.  Here's the deal.  There are certain times that it's.  Now, don't repeat anything.  There are certain times that you're able to say that, what you said and what you said.  Okay.  But considering what we're doing, you can't say it because in the context it's in. 
[01:28:00]  Right, right.  It's different.  I'm arguing context with Naked Girl.  Yeah, we're on the air.  You guys continue.  So just don't mention it.  We'll do the broadcast.  Don't even come close to mentioning.  Don't try to be clever and mention it.  Sorry.  That's all right.  I'll just keep talking about Bacardi.  There you go.  You just got to be careful because Strom Thurman back there.  NewYorkPartyByNight.com  You can give out the website.  You don't have to sneak it in.  What's the website?  No, it's PartyByNight.com.  But you can see my pictures on NewYorkPartyByNight.com. 
[01:28:30]  Or you can see them here through the stinky cam.  No nudity on that?  This is true.  All right.  No nudity on that site?  No.  Also doing, what did we learn this year on the Opie and Anthony show?  Yes.  Joseph from Hoboken.  My favorite ONA moment of 2001 was the Russell Crowe interview.  Ah, remember that?  I've never heard a more controversial, revealing interview of a Hollywood star on the radio.  See?  Most people interview him.  It's all fluff.  We got some answers from that guy.  Mike from Long Island.  This year I learned saying your mom's box is a great way to leave a show. 
[01:29:00]  Even if you're not leaving.  And Gay Marco goes to the pizza place late at night to pick up men.  Danny from Jersey.  I've learned that Dice loves to argue with his own sound bites.  West Coast Dave.  This year I learned that the last time the Red Sox won the World Series, Ronald Reagan was in first grade.  City's going at it today, Anthony.  It's ugly out there.  Tom from Philly.  Voss got new sneakers.  At least it's something new.  Pooter Toots from RonFez.net. 
[01:29:30]  I learned this year no matter how poor a decision a celebrity has made, they can always bring up the XFL to shut you guys up.  Oh, thanks.  Time plus tragedy equals comedy, example, the Titanic slide, Columbine paintball, and the Rockaway Beach wave pool.  Pete from Long Island.  This year I learned that when Ken Stevens gets angry, he sounds like a homeless black man.  And Drunken Tom from Philly.  This year I learned more about Norton's sex life than I care to mention, you sick F.  Nice.  So those continue to come in. 
[01:30:00]  As we take a break, another Christmas song from Brother Joe, Anthony.  Right.  It's kind of a takeoff on a very famous Christmas song.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  You might recognize it.  All right.  Grandma got run over by a reindeer.  Tell us every year, you friggin' nerd.  Glad to hear about your drunken grandma.  That tank the bitch got just what she deserved.  Well, I spent that fateful Christmas 
[01:30:30]  With the dick that wrote this song  Granny drank whiskey with Quaaludes  While toking sense of me and from a bomb  I tried to greet his evil grandma  But she kicked me in the nuts  She was sucking on a crack pipe  Yelling, piss off, die, you bastard scumbag bust 
[01:31:00]  Granny got run over by a reindeer  Every time I hear that song I twitch  Don't feel bad about that psycho grandma  Grandpa paid old Santa off to hit the bitch  There was dinner on the table  Granny's crawling underneath  Didn't know what she was up to 
[01:31:30]  Till I saw that big old smile on Uncle Pete  Granny left to score some Valium  Took off running down the path  That's when old St. Nicky creamed her  Grandpa thanked Rudolph while kissing Santa's ass  Granny got run over by a reindeer  Copping dope outside on Christmas Eve  Good riddance to that evil demon grandma 
[01:32:00]  As for me and Grandpa, we're relieved  Oh, Granny was a ho  Let them hang  Let them hang like the animals they are  Cop, cop, cop, cop, O.B. and Anthony  This is the O.B. and Anthony show

[01:33:00]  And some of those bits are going to be replayed  While we're away for about a week and a half  Sex for Sam 2 will be on the radio tomorrow  Yeah  Homeless Shopping Spree 2 will be aired Christmas Eve  So tell your friends about that one  That was our best show of the year, I think  Turn on the Yule Log on the TV, the volume down and listen to that  Tender moment, tender holiday moment  Coming in the year 2002, more O.B. and Anthony  Oh yeah?

Hey, let's talk to the Aussie ticket woman.  How did it go?  Great.  Good.  Good answer.  The longer you hold it in, the better it feels. 
[02:01:00]  I love you and all those.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to start throwing Bacardi drinks.  Did you understand what I said before?  That could have been anything.  It doesn't matter.  How many brain cells do you have in that brain?  Did you understand what I said?  Wait, I've got to ask you this.  Seriously.  Man, I'm small.  Did you understand when I said not even the slightest inkling?  I was talking about something else.  It doesn't matter.  But didn't you?  But I just said that.  The three brain cells in her brain are fighting for infection. 
[02:01:30]  You're not supposed to say anything, Fredo.  Wow, Ope.  You're killing us today.  Not dumb like everyone says.  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  I'm smart.  I was passed up.  I was stepped over, Mike.  I was stepped over, Mike.  We have a few listeners that I want to congratulate.  What's your name, Vicki?  Mike, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I just want to congratulate Bruce Valance for winning the Aussie tickets. 
[02:02:00]  Thank you.  Vicki, I love you.  You still doing the Hollywood Squares?  Oh, my God.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Vicki, I loved you in all those before pictures.  Goddamn, Voss.  Voss, you are a horrible man.  He knows we're only kidding.  We're having a good time.  These are all new jokes.  I'm enjoying the new Voss material.  Not me.  I don't drink Bacardi.  If I drank, I would, but I wouldn't.  Hey, you girls. 
[02:02:30]  Do you girls have any of your pictures on laugh.com where my CD is?  Oh, God.  I just ask it.  Oh, God.  Dude, you really should eat a bullet for that.  Oh.  Eat a bullet.com?  Yeah.  Look who just stepped in.  Old Dirty.  I was wondering where he's been.  Yeah.  What's up?  Wait, we have someone else that wants to congratulate you.  All right.  The Aussie ticket winner.  Sully.  What's up, fellas?  Hey, man.  That chick, the one from that Bugs Bunny cartoon where he's like, 
[02:03:00]  I've met so many interesting monsters.  What do you think?  Monsters are such interesting people.  All right, man.  And Merry Christmas, fellas.  Happy New Year.  Oh, you too.  Later.  All right.  We had a good year, yes.  No, I thought it was actually very fun.  It was very cool.  I wasn't sure if it would happen, you know, ever since you froze hands solo,  but things worked out all right.  I'm very happy.  She's a good sport, too.  Oh, my gosh.  She likes Ozzy.  You like Ozzy?  I love Ozzy.  Big Ozzy fan.  Ozzy's gone. 
[02:03:30]  That's cool.  Really?  Yeah.  That's good.  Kevin, what's going on?  Ozzy's gone, and I need to blame him.  You have to tell her the proper terminology for what she just did  is that she was filling a balloon.  No, that was the guy contest.  Yeah, that's pretty funny.  That's good.  Take it easy.  Bye.  All right.  Where's all dirty?  I know.  O'Day, where are you?  Where the Bacardi at?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The way was the Bacardi at.  O'Day.  The Bacconius. 
[02:04:00]  Don't fall asleep.  Yo, Voss, when you're going to chop that 100,000, 100,000 mile bench you got, right?  What you got, 100,000 miles on that bench?  You're wearing a Nordica jacket.  Why do black people wear Nordica?  You guys never go boating.  I go boating?  How many times have you seen a drive-by boating?  Oh, my man, don't you remember when they had the barge over there?  The only time you guys go boating is when you're being on sea, don't you think?  No, no.  Under the deck doesn't count in shackles. 
[02:04:30]  That doesn't count.  He's Dominican.  He's close enough.  The same block.  Happy holidays, old dirty.  Happy holidays.  Happy holidays.  There you go.  Thanks for joining us for our last live show of 2008.  I love this guy.  20-01.  All right.  Your knuckles are bleeding.  Did you walk here?  No.  Timberbush checking in.  Yo, Voss, what's up, man?  You can't crack jokes. 
[02:05:00]  You got to crack jokes on me?  He got no game until I get here, right?  Get out of here, man.  I got to say, Voss has had game today.  Yes, he has.  He's had no game.  He's had some games today.  He's had no game, kid.  He's had a lot of games.  Yes, Anthony.  I'm going to turn off their mics because Timberbush is checking.  He goes, that tattoo is a map out of her crotch.  Voss goes to the strip club and buys a strip glass of champagne. 
[02:05:30]  Champagne.  Yeah, he's serious.  Can I explain something?  If you make $1,000 a night, you're going to go bring champagne.  I've got to explain something to the Bacardi girl.  Yeah, go ahead.  There is a teeter-totter in this world.  On one side, you can put the hotness. 
[02:06:00]  On the other side, you put annoying.  Right.  Hotness weighs a lot.  Right.  Hotness weighs a lot.  The annoying has to be really heavy to counteract the weight of hotness.  I'll tell you something.  You're teetering.  I'm a Gemini.  You're right in the middle there.  Your hotness is going to start being a little too light.  The annoying side.  The annoying weight that's on that side.  The annoying side has the chick from Shallow Howe. 
[02:06:30]  If it gets to the point where annoying weighs down the one side and hotness is way up in the air,  I'm going to push annoying off so hotness can fall square on our ass.  What do you want me to do?  Huh?  What do you want me to do?  How many times have you heard that leaving cheers in Babylon back in 1985?  What do you want me to do?  You want me to shut up?  That's great.  Well, you know something? 
[02:07:00]  And as far as hotness being lighter, you know what a good example is?  Remember Young Frankenstein when Peter Boyle sat on the swing set with the little girl?  Right.  That's pretty much how outweighed it is.  That's how it's outweighed.  All right, genius.  What?  She's had a little too much Bacardi.  Boss.  Everyone's in the Christmas spirit.  Really?  Check the brake lights.  Everyone's in the Christmas spirit.  She is pretty, though.  Do you have a boyfriend?  No.  I can't imagine why.  Look at what people are saying. 
[02:07:30]  Look at what people are saying on instant feedback.  This isn't me.  It says, why do hot girls always have to ruin it by talking?  That's Sarah.  Oh, God.  Listen, jerk.  Wait, the hot girl from Queens has been well-behaved.  Yeah, the Queens chick has been nice and quiet and well-behaved.  Yeah, but too quiet almost.  Yeah.  It's because she can't put a whole sentence together.  Oh, God damn, boss.  That's messed up.  Boss, that's terrible.  Come on, boss.  They look like the drunken Charlie's Angels.  Look at these three. 
[02:08:00]  God, I want to get them in my car.  I got a nice Mercedes.  What are you doing?  I got a nice Mercedes.  I need two bands.  Huh?  I need two bands.  I need two.  It wasn't even funny.  Hello, angels.  Drink Bacardi and suck my mule.  Oh, man.  Anyway, I had to say something.  You've been saying stuff.  Been saying enough.  Believe me.  So let it slide.  Please.  You're feeling your Bacardi under-roose shorts right now. 
[02:08:30]  Under-roose.  Under-roose-y golfers.  Don't they look like under-roose shorts?  Is there a thong under those?  I had to ask you.  No, I'm not wearing any underwear.  Oh, nice.  Oh, yeah.  That's why it smells of essence up in this piece.  What are you talking about?  I smell your essence, Ma.  That's the Bacardi Limon.  That's why you can tell in the front.  You can see it looks like some material stretched over steel wool.  Right?  Lift that out.  A little bit.  I'm shaving.  Oh, yeah?  It's good.  Yeah, I know.  Let me prove it.  I can see the nubbles on your back. 
[02:09:00]  Norton?  Absolutely.  All right.  The huntness is totally gone.  Gone.  Gone.  Gone.  It's hot.  So you're from Weistone, right?  You man got a little cheese.  You got a little cream.  What's that way your man hold?  What is he looking at all day like, what are you saying?  Am I being robbed?  She doesn't even know.  You're from the country?  Interviewed.  Yep.  Yeah, what country are you from, sweetie?  Venezuela.  Oh, yeah?  Venezuela.  Oh, well, then you speak Spanish.  You know that your husband maybe has money because he lives in Weistone? 
[02:09:30]  Oh, my God.  She's already pregnant.  What did you do?  Are you real?  Look how they work, these people.  What do you do, my love, that you're not smiling with people here?  Because everyone is falling.  Oh, that's good.  That's what you want to hear.  No, I don't tell you, my love.  I don't tell you.  So, what's your gram go for?  Yeah, give the mic to Rick.  Hi, I'm Ed Max.  You can't speak Spanish.  It's just a facade.  It's just a facade. 
[02:10:00]  It's just a facade.  It's a fake Greek.  It's Puerto Rican facade.  If you go around the back of Rick, you'll see the front was just a facade and he's a white bread.  I'm going to interview her no more.  Why?  What was she saying?  Nah, she feels a little sick.  See?  What's she got?  She's intimidating.  Uh-oh, does she have the...  You got the Ebola?  No.  What do you got?  The ninja?  The hiv?  The hiv?  I'm happy.  The bug?  I wouldn't care if she did have the bug.  It'd be fine.  This is like a show.  Yeah, why not?  This is like a gorgeous...  Sure.  You know what I mean?  Like, I'm just watching the show. 
[02:10:30]  Just watching.  Yeah.  What do you like that old dirty, huh?  Entertaining.  OD, you liking that?  Entertaining.  You like that boob?  I feel any...  I love my Latino women from South America, especially when they got the Bacardi undero shorts on.  I'm feeling that.  You're feeling that?  Yeah, yo.  The pasties and all that.  Yeah.  That's not a pasties.  That's not a pasties.  That's the real deal right there.  What?  That's not a pasties?  Wait a minute.  You got them, like, surgically grafted to your skin?  No, it's just glued onto the outskirts. 
[02:11:00]  Stick on, kid.  Like in kindergarten, you get a star for doing good.  Right.  Oh, one of those.  Exactly.  Two good ones.  All right.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Yeah.  We have...  We're going to play the Sandy Cain home security system, though, before we go.  Yes.  This is pretty funny.  Steve just put this little thing together, so we'll check it out before we go to break,  okay, Ed?  Okay.  Oh, that's too funny.  More of the mess we call the Opie and Anthony show next. 
[02:11:30]  Stay there.  You're a burglar.  You've robbed a hundred houses.  Why should this one be any different?  You creep through the shadows and approach the large bay window of your next victim's house,  only to find...  A huge, naked, Sandy Cain.  Sweet, merciful Jesus!  My eyes!  Would-be intruders are met with a life-sized cutout of a naked, Sandy Cain.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! 
[02:12:00]  Blinding criminals instantly, causing them to flee.  Please just take me away!  Take me away!  As well as dogs, cats, and everyone else in a ten-block radius.  You'll kill us all!  You'll kill us all!  Look for your lives!  In every doorway.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  In every window.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!  Even in the doghouse.  The Sandy Cain security system is a triple threat for those ten percent that aren't affected 
[02:12:30]  by the devastating visual attack.  This system also features Twato, an ominous growth that squirts pepper spray at oncoming intruders.  It hurts!  It hurts!  Ah!  And for those more resilient O.J. type criminals, Twato's cousin emits a powerful nerve agent.  Getting woozy!  Can't feel like!  The Sandy Cain security system. 
[02:13:00]  I'm playing it!  I'm playing it!  I'm playing it!  Home security has never been so powerful or so disgusting.  You have 30 seconds to well leave.  Mmm!  Whip on mouth!  Whip on mouth!  Whip on mouth!  What's this out?  I got boobs to show you!  Wow!  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Finish up the year with our four shows.  Sports guys. 
[02:13:30]  Mornings.  Don and Mike.  Middays.  Opie and Anthony.  Afternoons.  Ron and Fez.  Nights.  1027.  WNEW.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Gary Hoey off the best of Ho Ho Hoey.  Gary Hoey.  He was in here yesterday playing this.  Yo Ho Hoey.  It's a great song, Anthony.  I know.  You know what makes it rock?  Hey, you don't look like Norton.  I know.  This should be the Opie, Anthony and Vanessa Show.  Oh, obviously.  I'm so funny. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  She was a real talker.  You're as funny as I can, sir.  Norton's not here to say it.  Where is Norton?  As funny as your new hairdo.  Oh.  You said you like my hairdo.  No, I do.  I like it.  Why?  Why are you sitting in Norton's seat and at his mic? 
[02:14:30]  Where is he?  You know what?  I'm looking at...  Why are you speaking?  Why do you have a mic?  Why do you have a mic in front of you?  I'm looking at your breasts.  Are those stretch marks real?  Oh, Jesus.  Me?  They look like roadmaps.  No, they are.  And I'm going to tell you.  What, do you have like a lot of kids or something?  Are your teeth real?  Yeah.  You'll know.  That was my question.  All day.  What?  I'm looking at them.  They're nice, but when you look at them, they kind of look like roadmaps.  I don't think so. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, come on.  Be for real.  I'll be for real.  You can take a picture of them.  I'm a real talker.  You've got to be a real treat to her and oral.  Shut up.  I smash you with a hammer.  Boss is working himself out of the mess.  Oh, like I'm really...  I've got to shopper.  Listen, Mr. Ed.  Shut up.  All right.  Let's get...  Mr. Ed.  Let's give Jim Norton...  He's going to give me a run for my money this one.  Oh, yeah.  Let's give Jim Norton a seat back.  Okay.  Yeah, that's all right.  Let me take these things up right here.  Thank you.  Somebody put a box on my chair.  All right.  All right. 
[02:15:30]  Okay.  All right.  We're back.  Everybody okay?  Everyone's okay.  Do we need the cash, Bill?  Set it down.  Do you...  Uh...  Did your mic work, Norton, or did it blow a stupid fuse?  No.  Uncle John, what's up?  She's very nice.  What's everybody mean to her?  She's very nice.  What are you mean?  They know better.  I'm kidding.  You're an idiot.  Don't let me sit on you.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey, uh, going with this, uh, what did I learn this year type thing? 
[02:16:00]  Oh, yeah.  We've been doing that.  Yeah, I put together, like, a little thing of comparisons between what I learned about O&A.  Okay.  Okay, the early years, Opie stores his mom's boobs and his dad's junk, while Anthony took  two horses on a date only to pick up a third.  Feature.  Opie likes to pick pumpkins, while Anthony likes to scream obscenities at computer screens.  Yeah.  Cars.  Opie's girlfriend's family does hubcaps as gifts, while Anthony's mom gets drunk and stings  Mercedes Benz.  Yeah.  Your phone is crap.  Your phone really sucks. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, great.  All right.  Do you want to try again or call you back?  Yeah, call us back.  I'll call you back.  Bye.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Tomorrow.  See you.  That's funny.  That's what we were going to say to you.  I really do like this.  Sean, what's going on?  Can I play with one?  Sean.  Yeah.  From Sacramento.  What's going on?  Yeah, F. Columbus.  Your ratings are great here in Sacramento.  We know that.  We said that yesterday.  Oh, well, I guess I'm a tape delay guy.  I'm a tape delay guy.  I got it.  Thank you, Sean.  Hey, you know that Danny Partridge did what she had to do for the Aussie tickets? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And who checked for the evidence?  Norton.  Norton checked for the evidence.  You didn't.  Again.  You didn't.  He didn't look close enough.  Why?  Yeah, she didn't.  Didn't you see that?  No.  You didn't look close enough.  She did a number two.  Could we take the microphone away?  Why do you have a mic?  It doesn't get me done.  Rick, why did you give her a mic? 
[02:17:30]  He loves me.  Ow.  I know.  Look at that.  She just chipped her tooth on the microphone.  She just pulled on the microphone.  Thank God, she's used to flesh.  You would have handled that if those were balls on the end.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  Goddamn boss, man.  Wow.  Ball's on fire.  He looks like Mr. Ed.  Yeah.  He's older than bosses.  I know.  Hey, you're not allowed to talk until Jay Moore says you can. 
[02:18:00]  Oh!  I don't get it.  I don't get it.  Of course you don't.  Of course you don't.  Yeah.  Like math or spelling.  Jim, you didn't take a quick, you didn't take a close look at what's going on.  I'm not going to poke my fingers in.  No, no, no.  Just take a look.  Take a look.  Because we noticed something during commercials.  We discovered something during commercials.  I don't want to drink down there.  Would you shut up?  I know.  God.  Jesus.  Thank you.  Please.  What?  Shut the mic off.  Norton's over.  Oh!  What's going on?  It looks like somebody banged. 
[02:18:30]  Trust me.  Okay.  It looks like somebody was playing a little football and they banged their nose and you  got to hold a napkin under the nose.  Right.  Exactly.  Oh, I didn't notice that.  Somebody apparently injured their nose.  It started bleeding from the nose.  They dabbed it with a napkin and threw it in that box.  That would explain because it smells like a Quincy episode over here.  That is so disgusting.  What happened?  That's so disgusting. 
[02:19:00]  Wow.  Billy Bob from Jersey.  Vanessa is about as funny as a kid's cancer ward.  Yes.  In keeping what's in the box, Steve has something.  Steve?  In keeping with the evidence in the box, there's a lovely little item floating in the toilet.  And I found it.  I can't take credit for it.  Norton found it, but he called me in to videotape it.  Oh, you got it on tape?  Oh, yeah.  It's called Norris's career.  Not even here to defend himself. 
[02:19:30]  Who cares?  Oh, my God.  Where are you going, Vanessa?  You already got the job.  Get up from under the table.  Shut up.  That's great.  Oh.  Any of you girls on the rag?  Anyone?  No?  That's what I'd ask.  Vanessa had a job interview.  Is that a head banging on the bottom of a table? 
[02:20:00]  Let him cheer off when you do say something.  He's a path big coming.  I was taking a sip of my Bacardi.  Shut up.  So that's what's on your chin.  Do you really think you're qualified for this position?  Mm-hmm.  Wow.  I was going to say first time.  Easy.  The language.  Sorry. 
[02:20:30]  She's really arrogant.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  Two minutes.  Two minutes.  Yeah.  What happened?  Really arrogant.  What did she say?  I said, you just noticed.  No.  30 seconds.  Look, even the other girls think you're arrogant.  That's my cousin, all right?  So she's got to deal with it every day.  You know?  It happens.  God.  Everybody loves me.  That's what they tell you.  Do you really love me? 
[02:21:00]  Uh-huh.  Open the car door and leave.  How many times have they said that to the top of your head?  Holy Jesus.  They're all sweating me in here.  Don't let them give you the wrong idea.  All dirty.  You're getting uncomfortable?  No.  I'm feeling this right.  Here, baby.  Come on.  Keep drinking some Bacardi.  I'll spread those wings on your back.  Why don't I have you flying? 
[02:21:30]  Who, the librarian looking one?  She's got that librarian look.  She's a cutie, right?  She is cutie.  Can I go get a book in your library or what?  Italian.  No.  Book all dirty.  Stop.  Stop.  Don't even try like you've read.  I'd step over her naked body to kick you.  Get out of here.  This is a hack, you know?  What do you say?  Boss is a hack.  It wasn't.  I said I'd kill her naked body to kick her.  This is all new material.  I'll kick you right in those teeth.  Enjoy it. 
[02:22:00]  Good.  Oh, she's using the Marian method of comebacks.  I don't know.  She's got a lot of teeth lines in there.  You've got to respect that.  No one's enjoying that.  I really am.  Anybody need a Bacardi cocktail while I go out and get one for me?  Yeah, why don't you go make some...  Is there a Bacardi rope and a Bacardi stool you can use?  Mark.  You stay in here.  I'll get to the box right now.  Bacardi shotgun with toe trigger attachment.  My mule wants to jump off and get earplugs.  Why don't you pretend...  Just saying. 
[02:22:30]  Why don't you pretend you're a nurse and I'll be Richard Speck?  Nice.  Richard Speck references.  Always funny.  Always good.  Always.  Richard Speck, one of my favorite serial killers.  Here's a Bacardi knife in the back.  Mark, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Shut up.  Hey, I want to sit down on the show today.  Yeah.  It only took about 353 days to get a laugh this year.  Very good. 
[02:23:00]  Let's get the math backwards, too.  That's funny.  Very good, Mark.  All right.  So, go make some drinks then again.  Yeah, please.  Could you do that?  Huh?  She ain't leaving the mic.  Anyone else needs to know me hollering.  Please.  Go get drinks.  Could you make a mixed drink with something that will take a long time to get?  Yeah.  Make a Long Island iced tea.  Yeah.  Do something like that.  All right.  All right.  We've got to go to the phones now.  Thank you.  Brian from Philly, what's up? 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, yeah.  First of all, I'd like to say that I usually hate Vaughn.  I usually hate him.  When he comes on the radio, I turn it down because I hate him.  As you should.  But he's doing good today.  The knuckle comment was beautiful.  It was beautiful.  Thank you.  But I usually do good radio when I'm here, okay?  No, you don't.  I got it.  I have nothing but...  Oh, forget it.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Another thing.  Tell that woman to shut up.  Oh.  Please.  Shut up. 
[02:24:00]  She's annoying.  You're annoying.  Yo, you shut up and take your hand out your ass.  Is it a jersey?  Punk.  All right.  Thank you, Brian.  Man, Frank.  Man, Frank.  Yo.  When's Norton coming to Philly?  Shut up.  January 25th, bro, at TLA.  Tickets go on sale Friday.  They go on sale Friday?  Yeah, man.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Thanks.  Vanessa has...  I do not...  Oh, I thought you left the studio.  Yeah, I left the studio.  No.  There she goes.  No.  Vanessa has left the studio. 
[02:24:30]  Remember my annoying hot teeter-totter?  Yeah.  Right now, hot is a feather.  Annoying is all the debris they've removed from Lower Manhattan.  That's the weight difference.  I guarantee you, if...  I can't say it without being Radio Clayton.  Oh, I'm back.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Don't say it like that, dude.  No, boss.  I mean, uh, Norton.  Oh, I'm sorry.  That wasn't it. 
[02:25:00]  No, that wasn't the way to put it.  No, that was a little too obvious.  I can just picture you going for the balloon nut and actually opening and talking.  Yeah, I think.  Hey, how come you only have one eye?  What are you doing?  Want a Bacardi?  I don't drink.  Oh, shut the f*** up.  I think she and I actually have some type of a vibe together.  Me too.  I feel it.  You should be wearing this on your nose.  Ugh.  You need a 24-step program.  Unless it's your snatch.  Oh, sure.  Jesus. 
[02:25:30]  Compared to a what?  I don't know.  But the sad thing is, I'm going to bang you later.  That's the sad thing.  That's the sad thing.  Norton, I'm not one of these strippers.  Oh, shut up.  You're topless.  She's going to cry, Dern.  I don't believe I'm doing this again.  Yes, you are.  I told myself I'd stop.  I never play around with horses.  Yeah, it's hard.  From what I saw on the internet. 
[02:26:00]  Wait, hold on.  Your friend might want to say something over there.  Somebody will stop drinking.  She is so pretty.  The Bacardi.  All right, wait.  Please.  What's the matter?  A Venezuela girl wants to say something?  She's getting very uncomfortable.  Why?  I'm fine.  I just said...  Like, give me a drink.  I want some.  Give her some of this.  Yeah, I want yours.  Yeah, right, right.  She's taking it away from you.  You're cut off.  They just communicate with each other. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah, that was very interesting.  You can have another one.  I got some in my car.  That's good.  Put the top back on.  The intellect's important.  I don't take pictures of you.  All right.  All right.  There we go.  Oh, God.  Moving on.  Oh, my God.  We're trying.  We're trying.  Can we try something fun?  Yeah, yeah.  Believe me, it's what happened.  What's happened for the last hour?  It's fun to us.  Yes.  That's for sure.  Did you guys see swordfish?  Huh?  No, but you smell like it.  Don't remember when we come out last year. 
[02:27:00]  Mr. Ed.  What was that?  Voss is a hack.  God damn Voss.  God damn Voss.  Beautiful.  Let me go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just want to know who's impersonating Voss in there.  Whoever it is is funny and original.  Well, we know it's not game work.  It's just his original stuff, and it's not stolen.  Oh, God.  Vicky Roof.  Mike T. Nicola has to punch you now. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, Jay Moore stinks.  It's the Alibaba of comedy.  Jesus.  Oh, Jay's in the room.  Turn the mics off.  Christ, overrated B actor.  All right?  Stinks.  Every movie's the same.  Well, be like you were in Suicide Kings.  They should have gave razor blades with that movie.  That's how bad it was.  The movie stinks.  Why are you watching Voss?  Oh, you're twitching.  What's wrong?  His name, Jay Moore.  Please. 
[02:28:00]  It's a water down Joe Rogan.  Whoa.  Wow.  Tom, what's up?  O&A, what's up?  Hey, Tom.  Wow, when Jews attack.  Hold on.  I'm a listener down here in D.C.  I'm from New York and New Jersey.  Yeah, go ahead, Tom.  I'm stuck in traffic every day going to work on this time.  Love you guys.  Thank you.  These two chicks are driving me nuts, bro.  I'm about to crash my car into the Tormac River.  Good.  I hope you do.  Oh.  Yeah, especially with that fake-ass accent you got.  Fake-ass.  That's the real deal.  That would be a bounce, sweetheart. 
[02:28:30]  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  That's the real deal.  But I know how you feel, dude.  Ted Kennedy was actually listening to her when he went into Chappaquiddick.  That's a river.  Anyone who feels the urge to drive their car into a pole, could you pick her up first?  I know.  I'll have a drink bag.  You want another one?  I'll have a drink bag.  I'm not comfortable without it.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Make your own jokes.  Yeah.  I like that.  All right, well. 
[02:29:00]  She would be really nice if she wasn't so arrogant.  She would be very cool, but she's very arrogant.  Yeah, you're a little too dark.  I'm having fun.  But you're arrogant.  Excuse me.  If it wasn't for me right now, this show would be beat.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it would be.  And she's delusioned as well.  You don't think we could trash Tina Colum?  We're talking about how...  Yeah, have you listened to this show?  Have you ever listened to this show?  I do.  Well, if it wasn't you, it would be somebody else.  Exactly.  I got entertained.  You're not entertaining. 
[02:29:30]  No, she's right, though.  She's saying, look, I am the dumbbell for today.  And she's right.  I don't care.  I'm getting paid man money.  Oh, yeah.  You're getting paid man money?  The dollar bill's in your shorts right here.  She is solid, though.  I know.  It's incredible.  It is nice.  The cheeks are nice.  I will say that.  She has good cheeks.  All right.  Well, we'll take a break.  Gee, look how the time flew.  I know.  Why, is your boyfriend going to get mad that you're being insulted?  No.  She said she doesn't have a boyfriend, she said. 
[02:30:00]  You come with a man or people?  He killed himself, I'm sure.  Do you come with a voice box removal version?  God, you sound like Brenda Vaccaro.  The only way I would envy your boyfriend is if he was Rush Limbaugh.  In my fantasy, she's drinking out of my mule and rubber cement comes out so she can't  talk after.  That might help your facial features.  Oh.  What?  What does that have to do with anything?  Oh, wow.  Thank you, Anthony.  You're right.  What does it have to do with anything?  He's bashing Norton and it doesn't even make sense. 
[02:30:30]  You leave my little chinless friend alone.  Wow.  See, just a dumb Long Island broad.  I know.  Sorry.  All right, check this out.  You are an arrogant dumb broad.  There is no Christmas in the silly Middle East.  No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus.  They have different religious beliefs.  They believe in Muhammad and not in our holiday.  And so every December I go to the Middle East and say...  Hey there, Mr. Muslim. 
[02:31:00]  Merry Christmas.  Put down that book, the Koran, and here's some holiday wishes.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Muslim ass and celebrate.  There is no holiday season in India, I've heard.  They don't hang up their stockings and that is just absurd.  They never read a Christmas story.  They don't know what Rudolph is about.  And that is why in December I'll go to India and shine. 
[02:31:30]  Hey there, Mr. Hinduist.  Merry Christmas.  Drink eggnog and eat some beef and pass it to the missing.  In case you haven't noticed, it's Jesus' birthday.  So get off your heathen Hindu ass and celebrate.  Now I heard that in Japan, everyone just lives in sin.  They pray to several gods and put needles in their skin.  On December 25th, all they do is eat a cake.  And that is why I go to Japan and walk around and pray. 
[02:32:00]  Hi there, Mr. Shintoist.  Merry Christmas.  God is going to kick your ass, you infidelic pagan scum.  In case you haven't noticed, there's festive things to do.  So let's all rejoice for Jesus.  Merry Christmas to you.  On Christmas Day, I travel around the world and say.  Now it's Christmas bonus and all you atheists, too. 
[02:32:30]  Merry Christmas to you.  Thank you, Mr. Hand.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  What do you do here?  Look at breasts.  If I wasn't on this show, I'd be out there with a wow sticker just trolling for breasts.  Thank you, Herbert.  Oh, yeah.  Hey, it's the Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to thank all our pals for stopping by today for our last live show of the year. 
[02:33:00]  Jim Norton, Rich Voss, Mike DiNicola, O.J., Stephen Lance, Tyke, Jamaican Mike, the Topless  Bacardi bartenders.  Somebody was writing on instant feedback.  These bitches make me want to switch my brand of rum.  Very good.  A few more. 
[02:33:30]  What did we learn this year on the Opie and Anthony Show, Anthony?  The guy who used to drink a lot but now goes to meetings from Hoboken.  I learned this year that you can still play the drums if you have half a pancreas.  Todd from Philly.  I learned this year Opie was raised on margarine and sugar sandwiches.  The tool from Brooklyn.  I learned the longer the rock block, the less talented the DJ.  Elton from Jersey.  Difference between hotness and annoyance.  Earplugs.  And Jerry from Edison learned a few things. 
[02:34:00]  Syndication leads to inner city battles.  Norton's favorite Christmas present is yellow and impossible to wrap.  Voss' dad's mule is called the hack shooter.  Under the deck and shackles doesn't count.  And hotness weighs a lot.  Yeah.  Louis Black wants to say something fast.  But annoying, much heavier.  Yeah.  Louis!  Hey, guys.  We only have a few minutes here, Louis.  Well, I just wanted to wish you a happy, happy and a slappy, crappy and all that.  Oh, thanks.  Happy holidays to you.  Or should I just say happy Hanukkah? 
[02:34:30]  Happy Hanukkah.  Yo, Louis!  Oh, old Dirty wants to...  Yo, yo, Mazel Tov, kid.  Come on, son.  Oh, God.  Where was he when I was in jail?  One sell over.  One sell over.  Yeah, you missed a good party today, Louis Black.  I'm sorry.  I had to go down here and work.  That's all right.  You know?  And you know what that's like.  Yes.  Where are you?  I'm at the Daily.  Oh, that's right.  The Daily, they call it.  Well, that's what I call it. 
[02:35:00]  That must be nice today.  Yeah, the Daily.  I'm working.  You know what it is.  The Daily.  Well, when I'm on your show, I say O&A.  O&A, the Daily.  You know, that's what we do.  We make contractions.  The Hiv, you know.  Well, happy holidays, Louis Black.  Yeah.  We'll see you in the new year, Louis.  I hope so.  My best to all the guys.  All right.  Thank you.  Because without them, you know, you guys are, well, you guys are a little bit better.  Thank you, Louis Black.  Take care.  All right.  Bye.  Check him out on the Daily Show on Comedy Central.
