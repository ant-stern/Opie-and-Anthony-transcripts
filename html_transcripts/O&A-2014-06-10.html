<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with in-studio guest Eric Nagle ("E-Rock"), detailing his gassy experience after consuming a Chipotle burrito bowl.  He launched into reviews from his consumer-focused Instagram account (@erockradio), showcasing his critical analysis of a Seattle craft beer (Elysian Brewery's Super Fuzz), while simultaneously mocking pretentious beer snobs.  The hosts riffed on E-Rock's review style, encouraging longer, more detailed posts.  They also discussed his burgeoning online rivalry with "Rolandos 99," another user employing the #theconsumer hashtag. E-Rock described his process of obtaining product samples, revealing reviews of various Oreo and Chips Ahoy! variations, Red Vines, and Slim Jim flavors, with the hosts and E-Rock engaging in extended jokes about his flatulence.  E-Rock then provided his hockey analysis of the New York Rangers' playoff loss before former New York Rangers goalie Mike Richter joined the show.

Richter's interview focused on his career, detailing numerous injuries (broken toe, blown-out knees, shoulder injuries, fractured skull, concussions), his retirement at 36, and the physical toll of goaltending. He discussed equipment evolution, rink size differences, team camaraderie, on-ice fights (including goalie fights), and playoff pressure.  He mentioned a Q&A with other former Rangers at the 92nd Street Y, his post-hockey return to Yale, the college vs. pro debate for young athletes, and dealing with inappropriate fan interactions.  The conversation briefly touched upon the Tracy Morgan accident, the firing of a nurse who posted a photo of him, and lengthy VA wait times for veterans. A listener called to thank Richter for his contribution to his father-son Rangers game experience.  The hosts announced their upcoming Friday off as a pre-planned vacation, not a permanent change, before returning to the Tracy Morgan accident.

The show then shifted to a series of loosely connected topics.  A vehement critique of inadequate veteran healthcare, juxtaposed with Guantanamo Bay detainee resources, segued into a discussion of perceived injustices in the treatment of veterans versus undocumented immigrants, criticizing Obama administration immigration policies.  The hosts extensively speculated on Donald Sterling's motivations in his NBA legal battle, analyzing the leaked audio recording.  A significant portion debated the rise in NYC shootings under Mayor de Blasio, attributing it to the end of stop-and-frisk, discussing its effectiveness, constitutionality, and racial implications.  The Clintons' post-presidency finances were questioned, challenging their claims of being broke. A caller's humorous anecdote about meeting the actor who played Shooter McGavin provided a brief interlude.  The 20th anniversary of the O.J. Simpson trial was revisited, analyzing key moments, legal strategies, and personalities.  Speculation about a potential Willie Nelson appearance (which didn't happen) led to banter and discussion of other potential guests. A Danish caller briefly commented on Adam Sandler's career, interspersed with frequent interruptions from an unnamed female caller, "Lady Di," causing frustrated exchanges with the hosts.

The final segment featured music reviews and discussions, interspersed with comments on drug use and sexually explicit remarks.  The hosts played and reviewed a new Snoop Dogg song ("Hangover"), a Snoop Dogg/Willie Nelson collaboration ("My Medicine"), and a Godsmack song ("1,000 HP"), along with commenting on an animated video of Seth Rogen and Snoop Dogg reviewing Game of Thrones. Marijuana use was a recurring topic. Comedian Mike Bocchetti delivered a crude, sexually explicit, and misogynistic personal ad for a dating service. The hosts discussed Spotify's impact on musicians' income, using a local band as an example, and the changing music landscape and decline of traditional radio.  They recounted their history with Godsmack's Sully Erna, including an anecdote about throwing a demo tape out of a car window. The show concluded with Opie promoting his upcoming stand-up shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  show on the road  good morning everyone  welcome aboard  hey  we just learned the consumer is  gassy, a little gassy this morning  from what we hear, reports have it  reports have it  hashtag the consumer, the consumer is gassy  a little gassy, alert the media  a little gassy  of course the consumer is E-Rock, also known as Eric Nagle  the Nagle Meister General  why are you gassy this morning? 
[00:00:30]  just woke up that way  what did you eat last night?  it always goes back to what you ate  you had some candy treats  I'm actually  following you now on Instagram  who is it? E-Rock Radio  love it  and I'm very excited to get the latest review on stuff I would never eat  by the way  the second I'm scrolling through Instagram  I don't even have to look at the name or anything  I just see some product  and I'm like oh here it is  E-Rock's ready  yep 
[00:01:00]  what's he saying about this?  no I  the gas is coming from the  the Chipotle burrito bowl that I had  oh  I had a  jeez  they're good man  they're great  chicken bowl  I gave up on those  I had to give up on those  I don't know what they put in them  they're delicious  but they are very gassy  although you probably go all in  I try to keep it a bit on the healthy side  you put the cheese  you probably put the cheese  you don't go cheese 
[00:01:30]  no cheese  no sour cream  it's just  that's how I go  but I do guacamole though  a little guacamole  a little guacamole  mmm  Chipotle  that sounds good  maybe we can get a few  I'm mixing a little Ortega taco sauce  I do like that  you little doll  why do you always need more?  because I don't like this sauce  tasty  tasty  I just need to add more  I'll tell you  this kid's palate though  is lucky  oh yeah  he gets a lot of treats  it does 
[00:02:00]  he gets a workout  not the only thing  I'm telling you  Iraq should be the poster for America  period  as much as we make fun  he represents most people  and the consumer is just  it means so much  because he's the consumer  that's right  yeah  what's this  the fruit vines bites  when did you post this?  I did two last night  it must have been when I went to bed  because I thought I was  up to date on the consumer  on Instagram  although it's  erock radio on Instagram 
[00:02:30]  right  hashtag  the consumer  yes  so what did you review last night?  I tried a  I tried a  craft beer from Seattle  and I also tried this new  fruit vines from Red Vines  I read the  the Seattle beer  one  so you basically had  little fruit roll ups  and drank  you convince yourself  that you're doing something  for work  I don't want to hug him  can you turn that screen  a little bit there  but all you have to do 
[00:03:00]  is pop it up on the TV  it's like  what happened  you hit two buttons  and you run over there  and then someone  pushes the whopper  and it turns on  unplug the god damn thing  we're in a great place  aren't we?  we thought that actually  would work  I love it  I like knob turning technology  go to the beer one first  because I did read that  and he's taking shots  at Seattle  for our Seattle listeners  that looks really stupid though  this beer looks ridiculous  what's it called?  it's called  I can't even read the label properly 
[00:03:30]  Elysian Brewery makes this thing  but why does it look like an F?  it looks like fly-sian  why would they hide the part  that makes it the E?  it's hidden under the other logo  that says Super Fuzz  Super Fuzz  it's a blood orange ale  now that sounds like  it would be good  I thought so too  it's like an old  Jimi Hendrix album cover  yeah exactly  I like a little fruit  in my beer every once in a while  it's going for this nice  little fruit  psychedelic like  party in a bottle  kind of promotion  and it's just garbage 
[00:04:00]  I read so many other reviews  they were saying  how great this is  and a lot of West Coast  beer aficionados  are just using all these terms  to make it sound  bigger than it is  and more important  let me tell you something  it just sucked  there is nothing worse  than a beer fucking snob  nothing worse  you want to just sit in your yard  with a nice cold bottle of Buds sometimes  and drink that  and if you post a picture of it  or say that  yeah just having a couple of beers 
[00:04:30]  what are you drinking?  not just a Bud  you need an Elysian  super fuzzy  fuck you  what's a snob's beer?  a snob's beer is some beer  you never heard of  some kind of craft beer  from a brewery that puts out  one case of beer a year  right  or they make it at home  yes  in their bathtub  and if you don't like Budweiser  or Coors or anything  that's fine  if you want to try the other beers  go right ahead  but just because a corporation  owns an alcohol 
[00:05:00]  there's this huge movement  now that you can't like it  or it's disgusting  meanwhile aren't these ever  subsidiaries of corporations?  not a lot of them are  sometimes they get bought up  some of them are  but not a lot  most of them are  most of them are small companies  the beer snobs  are like no you gotta have  the taste of this and that  the hops  do not  yeah  barley  how bored are people  that they're now commenting  on what beer you're drinking  it's getting ridiculous  out there  it's ridiculous 
[00:05:30]  who cares the fuck  you're drinking a Budweiser  in your backyard  apparently a lot of people  oh my god  too fancy for your own good  kick back  have a pabst  a pabst  that's right  regular Joe  Maddie Ice  Maddie Ice  I don't know why people  waste so much time  on nonsense  I don't know  I posted just a quick video  on Instagram  where it was a near miss  in the sky  I showed you the video  whatever  people are mad  that I said near miss  oh see  instead of near hit  yeah but it's a near miss 
[00:06:00]  that's what the FAA calls it  a near miss  yeah  it is a near miss  yeah  it missed  a near miss  it missed  and it was very near  very near  it's a near miss  it's a near hit  but they're arguing  this point on my Instagram  and I'm reading these  posts like  what's going on  with these people  when they report it  to the FAA  it's reported as a near miss  near miss  so that's the  vernacular  but it makes sense  to call it a near miss  doesn't it  yeah  yeah you gotta look at it 
[00:06:30]  like that  you know  there's missed  and it's very near  well planes are missing  all the time  missing each other  in the sky  yeah  but they miss far  they miss far  and you don't hear about  you only hear about  when it's a near miss  why are we arguing  not a far miss  a far miss  is called  just flying  right  so why is it  a near hit  technically  every great flight  you've ever had  is at one point  a far miss  of course  yes  of course  I don't know 
[00:07:00]  and they argue  about your beer choice  that's it  they don't like  the beer choice  they don't like  people just need  to belong to something  can I need to be  can I just raise  the white flag  and say  you got me  I'm done  I'm done  I'm done  I'm done  with these  insane  fucking  crazy people  some people  just take  an opposing  point of view  to argue  because they have  nothing else  to say  that's not true  wait a minute  nothing else  going on  yeah  I think I'm changing 
[00:07:30]  my avatar  to me just  raising the white flag  that'd be funny  I'm done  just a fucking  surrender flag  you got me  everything you've said  about me is right  okay  you got me  how are they  going to spin  that one now  I'm saying  that everything  you have said  is right  yeah  you got me  you know  it's no longer  the white flag  it's the universal  sign of surrender  all right  you got me again  right  how do I just say  you got me  across the board 
[00:08:00]  fuck  leave me alone  so uh  hashtag the consumer  yeah  can you read  what he said  about the Seattle beer  he's getting very  very uh  serious about his  reviews  he I think  they're carefully  worded  yes  yeah but he got  so much  publicity on the  show yesterday  that now he's  like writing essays  yeah yeah  before it was  like two sentences  oh all right  are you breaking  out the uh  thesaurus now  no  because I hate  those two  those dumb food  reviews that they're 
[00:08:30]  going off on  some tangent  and you know  it's a fucking  like piece of cake  or steak or something  just enjoy it  and eat it  oh I say the more  consumer writing  the better though  I think it should be  a little bit longer  than two lines  you rock  I demand it  yes  as a fan of the  consumer  absolutely  can I ask you  where does this go  like what is the  consumer  hashtag  consumer  the consumer  it's just  I realize  I see and eat  a lot of things  that people don't  normally know about  uh huh  like I'm going to  let people know  that these products 
[00:09:00]  exist  but what does  hashtag the consumer  he he's always  been this guy  so he's just  bringing it to the  masses  he just started  doing it  a lot of other  people  no no but he's  always been this guy  trying out new stuff  when you go to his  house he always has  stuff and you're like  how did you even  know about this  right  it used to be  goldfish was just  now a lot more  people know  but then they have  like birthday cake  goldfish  I'm like where do you  find out  who the hell  who the hell knew  I didn't know  and at one point  we were at an airport  and uh  opus talking with  steve blatter  and he just sees me  with my headphones 
[00:09:30]  was I feeling okay  that day  wow  I had my headphones  my ipad  I had like four  different things going  and he just yells  in the airport  and he goes  all you do is consume  consume  you're just a consumer  you're america though  yeah  I would embrace that  you are america  is hashtag the consumer  something you  just  yeah  decided to put there  yeah  oh okay  I thought maybe  it was some national  thing that people  were being  you know  asked to do  but it is  it is spawning  knockoffs  that is pretty good  have you seen 
[00:10:00]  the new consumer  yes I have  we'll get to that  in a second  let's start with  the real  the consumer podcast  you gonna do that  no  the consumer the movie  what  consumer the movie  50 years of consuming  all condensed  into one 90 minute  motion picture  I hope all this consuming  isn't taking away  from script writing  I know  I want that  the consumer  the podcast would work  I can't believe  you just went  no  that is true  it would work  every podcast is  starting to sound the same  you gotta be different  that's a different angle 
[00:10:30]  that's right  alright let's see  what you had to say  about  is it really  super fuzz  Elysian  super fuzz  oh that's right  see I wanted to do  the F again  because you don't see  that part of the E  fly cn  Elysian  super fuzz  alright go ahead  Sam what's the review  from the consumer  super fuzz  from Elysian Brewing  Seattle Washington  a blood orange ale  that is bitter  and you barely taste  the blood orange  it's like they fermented  with the rinds 
[00:11:00]  rather than the fruit  leaves a stale aftertaste  I read a lot of other reviews  where west coast  aficionados  ramble on  using terms  that make you roll your eyes  saying how amazing  this brew is  I just don't get it  probably need to up  my beer game  the label is misleading  seems like a psychedelic party  yet it's a depressing beer  from a depressing city  stick to heroin Seattle  hashtag the consumer  I love it  why would you 
[00:11:30]  I love Seattle  but I love the little jab  that was a pretty big  that was a big fist  to the chops  stick to heroin  stick to heroin  the consumer takes no prisoners  I want to go through  a quick exercise  before we go to the next one  here's a guy  that's on the phone  and Iraq blocked him  and he doesn't understand why  I've heard from a lot of people  we're going to have  an open mind now  and see  because I think  most people don't understand  why they're blocked  but I've heard from 
[00:12:00]  a lot of people  that say Iraq blocks them  before they even did anything  before they read anything  before they wrote back to them  that's a lie  it's a minority report  I know what they're going to do  yes  your future block  Eddie in New York  Iraq blocked you  for what you're saying  a witty comment  and making fun of him  for reviewing men's cologne  so what was the tweet  so the tweet was  this was a while back  I'm going back over  maybe six months now  and it was during  some of the horse races  that were going on  and if you remember 
[00:12:30]  one of the horse races  was something like  TTC for the win  or something like that  and he wrote something  all enraged  because the guy  he had lost  the race he lost  and I wrote  don't you mean KFC  for the win  and I thought  it was a little witty  don't you mean KFC  KFC  food joke  Iraq food joke  six month grudge  so worth it  right  he took offense  to it immediately  oh  oh  nailed him  we rock  he's gone by the way 
[00:13:00]  but a lot of these guys  think  that they can jump in  because  all of us  in this room  we bash each other  back and forth  and people think  they could just  jump in  with the same  type of jokes  but that's not  necessarily true  in some cases  it is  but some people  making you know  oh Iraq's eating  a lot  jokes like that  Iraq doesn't have  to take that shit  from fucking people  on Twitter  he's got to take  that shit in here  but he doesn't  right  and we all do  we all take 
[00:13:30]  you know  our bashings  in here  from each other  doesn't mean  we gotta sit  on Twitter  and have these  fucking  jamokes  give us crap  I love  when they reach out  to some of the staff  when they say  amp blocked me  for no reason  or hopes being a dick  whatever  and then you look  through their account  and they're saying  the most horrific  shit you guys  you're like  no fucking way  can't take a joke  not from you  take jokes  from people I know  you can't handle  your racism  apparently  apparently I can't  we all could  take a joke 
[00:14:00]  it's obviously  way past that  it gets way past  I know when it's a joke  I've been doing this  long enough to know  when it's just a joke  when people are being  genuinely shitty  and then they say  it's a joke  you know the difference  please  I've read  constructive criticism  that I didn't agree with  but it was done nicely  and I was like  alright  but then people don't  understand sometimes  how they're being shitty  I think sometimes  people don't even  mean to be shitty  and they don't realize  like if you read that  from another point of view  and you're not you 
[00:14:30]  it's cunty  when you say  you know  you suck  you're shit  you're not funny  and then use the argument  oh you can't take  a little criticism  no that's not  exactly  I have that discussion  in the mirror  every morning  I need to hear it  from you folks  yeah whatever  alright so  the consumer  hashtag  I didn't see this one yet  fruit vines  red vines  fruit vines  bites  cherry flavored  soft chewy fruit 
[00:15:00]  candy  fruit vines  I got so many jokes  six seconds  a cock second  at a time  I was gonna go  in another direction  of course  oh boy  this review is even longer  than the last one  long reviews came from  alright what is this one  new fruit vines  from red vines  candy  yeah  I only tried red vines  for the first time  a couple years ago 
[00:15:30]  based on a recommendation  from Andy Samberg  that quote  Mr. Pibb and red vines  equals crazy delicious  was not impressed  ooh  how can something  be so hollow  and unfilling  yet be so sweet tasting  oh  I guess I'm a  Dr. Pepper  Twizzlers guy  what  because Mr. Pibb  and red vines  right  as neither one  ever turned  the toilet water 
[00:16:00]  red  so basically  you shat  is that what you mean  oh yeah  you shitted out  red vines  no no no  the dye  in the red vines  kind of  changed the color  of the water  when you went  so I said  I'm never eating  this thing again  do you find  like little strings  tied to the top  of the stairs  in your house  your wife is really  gonna fucking  try to murder you  why because of  all the red vine shits  yeah she's married  to a man  and she has to  clean like little  red speckles  off the back 
[00:16:30]  of the toilet  she wants a family  what was the last  part of that  you said  you said something  in there  oh I said  yeah I did  eat a bag of it  alright  you ate a whole bag  I was watching a movie  at home  how can you  eat a whole bag  and then have  a horrible review  on it  you were not  impressed  no no  not on the  I was not impressed  with red vines  the original  red vine liquor  not the fruit vine  oh  so you liked  these  right  yeah

[00:20:00]  why fuck  they have  the golden  oreo  and then  they have  the regular  oreo  the golden  oreos  suck  is that  like a  light  colored  yeah  they already  sucked  sounds good  though  no  what are you  doing  having golden  oreos  how about  you  when you  would go  to someone's  house  and they  would have  the golden  oreos  the golden  oreos  or hydrox  the white  ones  the white  and dark  the hydrox  were even  worse  they'd alternate  the light  and dark  ones  like that  hydrox  worse  I'd hate  that  I'd separate  them all  up  and put  and you'd say 
[00:20:30]  that the two  bowls were  equal  but the one  bowl was  cracked and  shitty  and the other  bowl was  really good  you don't want  mongrel  mongrel  cookie  both trees  would be  destroyed  hydrox  were the  poor man's  oreos  we all know  that  and you would  take one of  those vanilla  oreo cookies  over a  hydrox  any day  but  yeah  yeah  Iraq  comment  hydrox  suck  but they  are coming  back  for some 
[00:21:00]  reason  what are  the two  new flavors  for oreo  well there  is banana  split  oh  alright  but here's  the weird  thing  half the  cookie  is the  original oreo  cookie  the other  half is  the golden  and then  you got  a banana  strawberry  mix  in the  middle  so there's  like too  much going  on  there's  all kinds  of shit  in there  huh  right  and then  there  dip that  in oj  that'd be  delicious  and there's  this one  which is also  a target  exclusive

[00:26:30]  in a can  every once in a  while  let me think of  them raviolis  for a minute  i haven't had  them in a century  that shit  might have been  pretty good  it must be all  the salt they  put in them  but every once in  a while i'll  take a can  and just heat it  up and eat the  whole fucking thing  you gotta heat it  i know people that  just eat it out of  the can  yeah right out of  the can  you are crazy  no i have done  that  spaghettios with  hot dogs right  out of the can  no you gotta  heat that shit  up it's all  congealed and  coagulated  it's already  cooked  no you have  to heat it  no you don't  no you don't 
[00:27:00]  alright i recommend  heating it  heated or unheated  we're taking your  calls  they make a nice  pizza spaghettio  that i'm gonna  try soon  the beefy taco  one is uh  is horrible  it's just  spaghettios and  taco sauce  why don't you do  restaurant reviews too  i mean you might  as well  why  why not  it's just in  addition to  what he's  home he's got  his feet  kicked up  he's drinking  some beer  why go out  because he likes  to go out  i'm sure his wife  wants to go out  once in a while 
[00:27:30]  so he can make  a whole thing  out of it  that's against  the brand though  it really is  the brand is  he's sitting in  your house and  trying the shittiest  foods  he's gotta make  videos though  i was talking to  erog after the show  yesterday  a quick minute  video  i would like that  a quick minute  video  not all of them  just a real special  product  you could do that  you show the product  you show the camera  the product  then you open it up  you do the smell test  like you said  you taste it  and then you give  your 20 second  review on camera  maybe one out of  every 10 products  that you review 
[00:28:00]  is a video  review  that would be cool  where are you at  with potato chips  well  funny you should ask  they're getting crazy  we're a lot of  flavors now  if you look up on  erog radio  on instagram  there  he's getting a lot  of people  following the  last few weeks  i've tried those  new mystery doritos  flavors  from their jacked  line  and they're all  horrible  i think you told us  about that  didn't you  there is one  how many will you  try before you know 
[00:28:30]  that it stinks  thank you  four to five chips  and then you go  like this  there's no way  this is turning me  and you just throw  the bag out  oh you throw it out  wow  erog you're pushing  10,000 followers  on instagram  it's crazy  it's going up  fast now  yeah the jacked  they did this  a couple of years  ago  these mystery flavors  where they say  test flavor  with a number  test flavor  404  and the last time  they did this  they had an amazing  flavor that was  doing well  but they pulled it  off the shelf  it was  mcdonald's 
[00:29:00]  cheeseburger  flavor  it was delicious  and  then all of a sudden  it went away  and then they brought  back mystery flavors  again and all three  of them have been  garbage  like one of them  is covered in  cocoa powder  cocoa powder  it's like chocolate  doritos  it's gross  they're starting  to cover the  potato chips  with chocolate  products  dark chocolate  and all that  shit  because they know  that that salt  and chocolate  go together  so they're trying  to get on the  bandwagon  caramel and sea salt 
[00:29:30]  at whole foods  they sell a chocolate  bar that's potato  chips in the middle  it's pretty amazing  actually  it's pretty damn  good  you know what I  eat those  what are they  called something  blitz things  arctic blitz  they're not  they're not  amazing  but they're like  when I want  frozen yogurt  or something  like they're  really low  calorie  they're not  but they kind  of fix that  craving  yeah  because this  time's where  I want some  ice cream  or whatever  oh yeah  I can't remember  the name of them  I never heard of it  it's not ringing  a bell  fuck  I like a good  ice cream sandwich 
[00:30:00]  but we've gone  through that before  sure  people can feel  free to send  stuff too  sometimes there's  stuff that's just  on the west coast  that you can't  get on the east coast  why is that  because some of  these companies  can we eat the same  they have a ranch  fritos that you can  only get on the west coast  why  I don't know  I want it  send it  do you want to  take a look at  the consumers  competition  yes  by the way  he's the one 
[00:30:30]  that's pushing  10,000 followers  on Instagram  how many  are you up to  Iraq  wait who  the consumers  competition  hashtag the  consumer  Rolandos 99  right  there's big  competition  happening  I'm about  8400  8400  we'll get that  number up for you  Iraq radio  I know  it's too easy  this is the  corksicle  corksicle  and 
[00:31:00]  Rolandos 99  writes  Roland's  hashtag  the consumer  review  my review  of the  corksicle  it's awesome  hashtag  corksicle  is he ripping  you off  yes  he's got  hashtag  the consumer  Jesus  and he's got  this  this was actually  just posted  52 minutes ago  oh okay  and he writes  it's a picture  of a fan  in the office  yeah  and he wrote  just bought  a fan  today  it blows 
[00:31:30]  hashtag  the consumer  that's very good  and he did  another one  actually  he shouldn't do  that because  he would like  to infuse  his and  he rocks  this was actually  30 minutes ago  this was just  actually it looks  like in the  office  just drank  a venti  chai latte  ah  refreshed  ooh  and spicy  hashtag  the consumer  he's ripping  you off  and there are  people on 
[00:32:00]  Instagram commenting  great original  idea Roland  love hashtag  the consumer  surely no one's  thought of this  before  oh boy  oh don't people  remember that you  rocked it  fight fight  maybe Roland  should get some  consumer videos  out there  hey it's weird  that I like  I can't picture  Roland home  though  Roland's weird  he would never  sit home  you guys are  opposite actually  because he wouldn't  like to sit home  and eat those  type of snacks  it doesn't seem  he wants to go  out and  he thinks he's 
[00:32:30]  a man of the  world  oh yeah  Roland really  thinks he's  a gentleman  like out dining  fine dining  very worldly  he's not worldly  though  yeah I think  a lot of  the consumer's  foods would be  filed under  Roland's category  of pedestrian  pedestrian  very pedestrian  he should have  the hashtag  the pedestrian  oh man  he rock or  Roland  I think  Roland  you know  Roland's got  a hashtag  the consumer  right now  it's taking  off  yeah 
[00:33:00]  Roland's not  going to be  getting high  fives in the  subway  he's in a  weird mood  today  the Rangers  are getting  their asses  handed to  him  right on the  brink of the  big sweep  of Rooney  obviously two  out of the  three games  could have  went either  way  but they  are down  three games  to zip  last night  was grim  I watched  and  well you're  a big  Rangers fan  huge Rangers  fan  right  here's my  analysis of  the game  whoa  it looks to  me  that the  Rangers  have to be  at a  10 intensity 
[00:33:30]  to equal  the Kings  like 7  intensity  like they  gotta  fucking  skate  and be  perfect  when the  Kings  it looks  a lot  easier  for them  well the  Rangers  can't  out skate  the Kings  well  we all  know that  they have  to be  more scrappy  yes  and they're  not  hitting  enough  not enough  what they  call  forechecking  I'm seeing  I'm also  noticing  that that  goalie  quick  is like 
[00:34:00]  they built  a brick  wall  in front  of the  goal  well he's  standing on  his head  standing on  his head  that's what  he's doing  30 some  odd  I think  34  35  whatever it  was  shots on  goal  from the  Rangers  not one  gets through  and boy  were some  of those  real tricky  anyone who's  willing to do  a split  and expose  their cock  to a speeding  puck  heading toward  them  god bless  so the  Rangers got  their asses 
[00:34:30]  kicked  could not  capitalize on  the power  play  it's very  frustrating  when you see  a team  when you see  your team  when you're  sitting there  watching your  team  when they  are on a  power play  and there's  a lot of  passing  a lot of  finagling  with the puck  going on  and not many  shots on goal  you don't want to  watch that clock  wind down  and see  they only took  two shots  I understand  they gotta  set it up  I understand  they gotta 
[00:35:00]  cut some  fucking lanes  open up some  lanes to the goal  but Jesus  Christ  take some  fucking  shots  it's over  I know  it's over  I know  I know  but  you honestly  think the  Rangers are  gonna win  four games  in a row  now  no but  tell you  the truth  they said  that the only  team that  has done  that was  1943  I think  something  what was it  the maple  leaves  I don't know  but  how many  teams have  tied 
[00:35:30]  after dropping  three  how many  have come  back  and gotten  three  because  that's  all you  gotta do  because  then it's  a brand  new  game  then you  actually  have  the  moment  you  have  a  tremendous  advantage  but  not many  teams  have done  that  it's  happened  four times  and only at  once  has it  actually  gone on  to a  game  has the  team  gone on  to win  the other  three times  the other  team  actually  came back  and won  it's  over  the four  times  oh he's  getting  cheap  I saw 
[00:36:00]  your mouth  just  kind of  curl up  at the  ends  it's  over  well it's  not over  until it's  over  yes  until the  consumer  sings  sorry  Jimmy  no but  that's what I  guess  I'm holding  my dumb  eye frog  sorry  to Jimmy  I'm not  going to  you wrote  the apology  to on that  one  yes  oh boy  yeah it  looks very 
[00:36:30]  grim  and  yeah the  first two  games really  could have  gone either  way but  that one  last night  was just  a blatant  slap in  the face  right there  on the  Rangers  home turf  Madison  Square Garden  greatest arena  in the world  they look like  they're not  going to be  champions  but you know  you never know  no it's not  going to happen  all right we  should take a  break here  Mike Richter's  coming in  yes  from the 
[00:37:00]  Stanley Cup  champions  of 1994  get him in  the goal  what  I have a good  question for him  no that shows  my prowess  you do  hockey players  I know how to  interview hockey  players  yeah  you start off  when they sit  down you go  so how old  were you when  you started  pucking  oh man is  that good  that's good  america  america  america  america 
[00:37:30]  fuck yeah  coming again  to save the  motherfucking day  yeah  america  fuck yeah  freedom is the  only way  yeah  terrorist  your game is  through  cause now you  have to answer  to  america  fuck yeah  flick my butt  and suck  on my  america  fuck yeah  what you gonna  do when we  come for you  now  oh 
[00:38:00]  oh  what is it  sopranos  um  I  I  I  I  Sopranos  Sopranos  ended what  let me take a  look  yep  Sopranos  five years  seven  what  seven years  ago  there's no  way that was  seven fucking  years ago  yep  there's no  way  that was  maybe five  life  say I went  with flying  car 
[00:38:30]  you're supposed  to have  flying car  seven  there goes  your life  when I said  five I expected  you to go  not four  right  seven  seven  anywhere  wow  where's the  steve perry singing  nowadays  I saw that clip  popped up the  other day  don't stop  believin  oh really  is he toning it  down a little bit  well he kinda  when you take the  guitar and go  ning ning ning ning  no no no no 
[00:39:00]  no no no  can I see steve  perry singing  he came out of  retirement I think  after how many  years  fifteen or  something  fifteen years  I'm guessing  I'm thinking  what was his  problem  hold on  hold on  hold on  hold on  hold on  hold on  hold on  what's the  story behind  this clip  he was  somewhere  but was  this a  surprise  did he just 
[00:39:30]  come on  stage  I think  it was  a surprise  yeah  so who  was  performing  why were  the people  there  to begin  with  they were  there to  see  another  bang  it was  cliven  bundy's  birthday  party  and he  was  the  surprise  singer  oh  I just  want to  know  the  back  story  here comes  Travis  he knows  Travis  how happy  are you  that the  rangers  are not  going to  win  the  Stanley  Cup  oh boy  nice  you love 
[00:40:00]  the  rangers  what  you  rangers  fan or  no  no  that's  good  no it's  not good  you're  American  what are you  doing  I don't  think that's  how it  works  what's  the story  behind  the  Steve  Perry  clip  he was  at an  eels  concert  and  damn  eels  again  aren't we  just  talking  about  the  eels  that's  why  we  were  talking  about  this  instead of  discussing  this  story  we  just  talked  about  the  eels  and how  they  were  a  one  hit  wonder  they  were  yeah  then people 
[00:40:30]  had to  beat  me  up  soon  actually  actually  actually  actually  what  actually  what  come on  raise the  white flag  oh yeah  that's right  I raised  the white flag  this morning  right  you're right  about everything  leave me alone  just leave me  the fuck  alone  you're right  okay  everything you  want to say  about me  you're right  see  just leave me  alone  you fucking  lunatics  so I guess  they're friends  but the eels  I mean  if you  if you  if you  listen to 
[00:41:00]  the radio  for  I don't know  let's say  20 years  and you  can only  pick out  one song  the band  did  that is  a one  hit  wonder  certainly  is  thank you  there were  a lot  of them  in the 90s  and they  were one  of them  there  so I guess  they're friends  and he had  mentioned to the  lead singer  that he always  wanted to sing  one of their  songs  so he's not  even singing  a journey  song  he sang  one of their  dumb songs  he sang  it's a  motherfucker  right  I wonder  why that  wasn't a hit  but then  he sang  some  journey  here's 
[00:41:30]  it's a  motherfucker  on  mix  FM  what  he didn't  do the  right  lyrics  so he  sang  don't  stop  ass  eating  believe in  and I think  he did it again  last week  with the eels  so why didn't  Steve Perry go away  didn't he have a throat  problem or something  was the rumor  that's what I heard  19 years  this was the first time  in 19 years  that he sang  19 years  it's crazy  he probably sang  somewhere else  in his car  no one saw it  no one saw it  live  maybe in the shower  a couple times  and maybe 
[00:42:00]  you know  at a barbecue  yeah  with close  family and  friends  all right  so then  did he sing  the journey  song  yeah  get past  his eel  song  and get past  the goddamn  shit  get right to  the journey  yes  what journey  song  do you remember  Anthony  I'm gonna go  with lights  oh man  no  that's  you know  all of the  songs are  high  but  I think  they  they  tune  down 
[00:42:30]  a little  bit  I don't know  I forget  the two songs  that he sang  the first night  I didn't know  I'm not a huge  journey fan  but they weren't  like  songs that  a 33 year old  really  wheels in the sky  bring bring  bring bring  anyway  he wanted  he wasn't  don't stop  believing  what are some  of those other  journey songs  we got  well why don't  you go forward  I don't know  on the video  until he starts  singing some  journey  start right there 
[00:43:00]  fuck it  no no  no it's  this guy babbles  he rambles on  and on this guy  singers that could  kind of keep it  going  some can  some can't  I know  19 years later  whatever it was  yeah  you're not going  to get your  voice as high  but he just  looks really  awkward and  doesn't sound  good at all  on any level  no he's all  bleh  bleh  you would think  he's a professional  enough to figure out  a better way to sing  that song nowadays  sometimes your body  just ages  and your fucking  voice goes to  shit  sometimes you don't 
[00:43:30]  take care of it  but he had  some real issue  yeah I think he had  polyps  some of those  polyps  throat polyps  throat bitch  polyps  yeah  because that's  it should be  better than that  yeah  damn  I heard it ended  one of his  relationships  really  polyps  they were arguing  and the girl  said something  about at least  I'm not  polypy  you did  weak joke  you know what  you gotta do  really  it's a joke  I should say 
[00:44:00]  yes  weak serious  statement  that in my mind  I thought might  be humorous  that I realized  was very bad  judge nerd  as it came out  Sam one more  thing  do open arms  with the new  journey singer  oh there you go  and this will be  less than a year old  yeah  Steve Perry  probably is close  to hanging himself  damn  there you go  open arms on  no do the TV one  three down 
[00:44:30]  yeah this is from  like Diofra  or something like  that  yeah  Jesus  Steve Perry  is just like  jeez I thought  I was fucking  you know  right  I guess everyone  could just do this  except me  I think there were  rumors he was  difficult too  yes  because then he  stepped out  he stepped out  as a solo guy  yeah  left his guys  behind  how'd he do  as a solo  really good  for about a year  or two  what was a big  solo song  from  Oh Cherie  oh yeah  I remember  that song 
[00:45:00]  I hate it  and he had  some MTV play  he had about  two or three  I think on his own  right  maybe  yeah  but he got an album  out of it  and he was doing  well  and then boom  out of nowhere  he was done  I remember this one  oh boy  this was huge  though  oh yeah  Steve Perry  his solo  which just sounds  like Journey  but he liked  the slow  ballads 
[00:45:30]  oh Jesus  I would love  to hear him  try to sing  this one  should have been  gone  Lily  Marilyn  Marilyn  should have been  gone  should have been  gone  yeah  this was a  biggie  back in  what was that  87 
[00:46:00]  88  it wasn't a bad  song for  the time  it's kind of  dated now  I guess  what everybody  was trying to do  pretty much  sounds like a  Journey song  yeah  just missing  a little guitar  in there  John in Rochester  good morning guys  how's it going  hey John  hey man  hi John  if you go to  YouTube  and pull up  the searches  over by the  zoo  which is the  Arnald Panetta  the dude  that's singing  for a journey  right now  he sounded  like a lot  of different 
[00:46:30]  people  it's crazy  man  he sounds  like  you could have  been listening  to Survivor  but it was him  singing in a  Philippine bar  really  oh yeah  I've seen all  those videos  a lot of them  are part of the  documentary  that's on  Netflix now  but yeah  his band  was called  The Zoo  you said that  right  yeah  or Zoo  right  and I think  he sounds  pretty good  as Axel  do the Survivor  one  up top  let me see  this  2007 
[00:47:00]  is this like  the shit  that Neil Sean  saw  Neil Sean  said he was  just on YouTube  in the middle  of the night  and he was  like kinda  checking out  journey clips  and this and  that  and this kid  popped up  Mike Richter  is finally here  oh  we could do  this later  I guess  I'm gonna ask  him how old  he was  when he started  pucking  oh god  Mike Richter  from the  the 94  team  that won  the Stanley Cup  Rangers  yeah 
[00:47:30]  oh come on  right in  why not  we say  what's up  Mike  how you doing  sir  hey Mike  alright  welcome aboard  nice  take a seat  man the  Rangers aren't  gonna win  the Stanley Cup  how much  does this  suck  oh man  hey  how much  does this  suck  early for that  kind of talk  how much  does this  suck  exactly  getting their asses  kicked  slow down  getting their asses  handed to them  by the LA  rewind here  slow down  if you're not  in the final 
[00:48:00]  and these guys  have worked their  ass off to get  here so  they should be  proud  and look  they've lost  by just inches  in these games  oh yeah  could go either  way and LA  knows that  and you know  I'm a Ranger  fan of a bit  of a homer  but I do think  they'll win  Wednesday  this is a very  very good team  sometimes it's  tough to come  back and play  at home  there's different  expectations  you see them  in the power  play  but look  Kings know  it's not gonna  get over in a hurry  I don't think  these guys are gonna  roll over and die  there's too much  character on both  sides  but in the end  the Kings  will be hoist 
[00:48:30]  in the cup  Jesus  I'm not  conceding that  no not at all  it's too bad  and then it's  gonna hurt a lot  more next year  knowing they were  in the finals  and then  didn't win  no no no  first of all  I saw these Rangers  are still playing  and 28 other  teams can't say that  and I'll tell you  this they've played  really well  what do you mean  my team  the Islanders  the New York  Islanders  see  that's what his  problem is  I think we've  seen the root  of the problem  right  exactly  we had a great  chant until you  guys won in 94 
[00:49:00]  I know that really  hurts  we had a wonderful  chant that you  had to ruin  how old were you  when you started  pucking  actually I grew up  in Philly about  six years old  I was playing  older brothers  playing street  hockey mostly  you know  the Flyers then  were winning  Stanley Cups  they're one of the  better teams in the  league  so that's who you  followed and that's  what you wanted to do  as an athlete  are you a Flyers fan  though  I still kind of am  you know I mean  I learned to hate  them when I played  against them  easy enough to do  but it's a great  you know  you look at New York  Boston  Philly 
[00:49:30]  there's some great  sports teams there  from you know  each of the sports  football  baseball  basketball  so yeah  you grew up  kind of bleeding  their colors  and the minute  you're drafted  by the Rangers  that becomes  your place  and I didn't  realize how much  I'd end up  loving this place  until you live here  and then you get  to know the people  that you assumed  were you know  horrible  and everything else  people love to hate  New York  because most of  the people  have never had  experience  and then they  turn you back  on Philly  that's wonderful  as quick as you can  because they're not  giving you the big  paycheck 
[00:50:00]  no the first time  you get beer  poured on your head  as you're entering  the stadium  you say you know  I actually like  New York a little  bit more now  wow  as soon as you  cash that check  you're like  Philly ho  had never heard  of them  how the hell  does a goalie block  35 shots on goal  36 shots on goal  like that  like quick  last night  I always say  whenever I won  I played a great  game and when  we lost  we didn't play  well  no it's a  small joke  honestly  I look at those  games now  and the players 
[00:50:30]  are so good  they're so big  in every sport  they've gotten  bigger stronger  faster  and in hockey  I think it's  the best competition  you're seeing  ever  and I don't  think there's  a position  that's really  improved more  than goaltending  guys are bigger  and stronger  faster  you saw how  good Mike Crick  was but I mean  Lundqus has been  on this all year  in fact from the  moment he stepped  on the ice  at Madison Square  eight years ago  he's been amazing  when you see old  footage of hockey  games from let's  say the 80s  mid 80s let's say  it almost looks  like a joke  how different  the game is now  we had training  camp one year 
[00:51:00]  in Vermont  and guys were  looking at replays  ESPN throwbacks  and they had all  these classic games  and they showed  Edmonton Oilers  who were the  fastest team in the  NHL of their time  and they're playing  I guess the Islanders  and the Islanders  had an unbelievable  tough fast team  and we're looking  at this  and it was just  kind of quiet  for a while  and finally  I think it was  Tony Amante  a young brash  guy from Boston  great guy  he's like  this is horrible  and Max is going  wait a minute  whoa  that's our  championship team  but the difference  in just that decade  made so much 
[00:51:30]  and I would say  it leapfrogged again  go look at the 94  there's a lot of  tough guys  great play  but these dudes  on the ice  right now  there was a time  you were able  to actually hold  the puck for a split  you know  a second  two seconds  even  but you know  you cannot  you can't  I had my son  at the game  last night  just watch  the decisions  and same thing  with quarterback  anything  you get the ball  in basketball  you run a  pass pattern  in football  you receive the puck  in hockey  I don't know  how the guys score  I play men's league  now  I'm a crappy 
[00:52:00]  defenseman  but I go down  and I look  at these high school  goalies  they drop to their knees  they take away  the bottom part  of the net  there's nowhere to go  and you forget  the forwards  you get the puck  off your stick  or else you're  going to be plastered  so they make  decisions immediately  it's awesome  to watch  but you still play  I still do  yeah I love the game  what league  there's no league  I play pond hockey  I play pick up  men's league  you look like  you're in great  shape still  but I'm not  getting any faster  I'll tell you  the agility  of goalies  these days  is amazing  they're big guys 
[00:52:30]  all that gear  and yet just  laying into  a complete split  on the ice  like that  they had some  of the old time  I love the old  garden pictures  and what not  they have up there  and the garden  vision between  periods  and they showed  pictures of  Gump Worsley  and you know  as it goes back  I mean  I'm looking at  pictures when I  came in  it's old  and the players  weren't as  conditioned as  they are now  and hockey's been  of the top four  sports  lagging behind  and it's not so  much anymore  I mean the  Europeans come in  here  you know  the old Soviet 
[00:53:00]  system  these guys  were well conditioned  and now  everybody has to be  you'll lose  your job  I must break you  I must break you  Bill  if you look at  the old goalies  there's always  kind of like  the big chunky  guy that couldn't  play out  alright  he'll fill it up  Billy Smith  are we talking about  Billy kind of  he had his foot  in both worlds  he was a great  he was an ugly  player  he was an ugly  though  that's why  I loved him  he loved throwing  boy did he  oh man  you got in that  crease  you were getting  a big glove 
[00:53:30]  in your face  oh he loves  sweeping that  stick back  behind the neck  he was a money  goalie right  he would just  come through  in the clutch  all the time  big drinker too  I used to caddy  for him  that's how you  get by  for real I did  that's how you  get by  I was just a kid  caddying for all  those guys  when they win  all the cups  the secret of  goaltending right  there  sort of  makes the knee  injuries a little  easier  but that's when  the game is  different  if a goalie  left the crease  he got just 
[00:54:00]  hammered  if you look  at those  old films  we can laugh  about the speed  of those games  in the 80's  these guys  were tough  I mean  they were tough  all of them  if you look back  it's just a different  era  someone would  break their nose  I have to say  there is a kind of  code of ethics  in hockey  where you just go  look you're not  going to be griping  about it  you're going to  put your nose  back on  and go out  and play  I think there's  a lot of pride  in that  how many broken  bones did you  suffer  my first broken  bone was my  second pinky  toe from my pinky  I stepped on a skate 
[00:54:30]  in college  I cried a little  bit but I got  through it  goaltenders  allowed to cry  no I actually  didn't break  many bones  I blew up  both knees  shoulder injuries  and ended  with a fractured  skull  so that was  I began with  a bad toe  and ended  with a broken  skull  what was that  a knee  you took it out  it was a slap  shot that  originally went  through my  ear hole  if you can  believe this  it was the  craziest thing  it was my own  fault  I kind of  twisted a little  bit on a tip  shot  and I didn't  watch it in  and pop it  it hit me  oh wow  that was the  beginning of the end 
[00:55:00]  there  was that a concussion  too  it was a concussion  too  how many concussions  have you  I think if you ask  any athlete  over the course  of their career  falling out of trees  as a kid  getting hit  playing football  and all through  I couldn't even  count them  don't know  oh man  any issues  because of that  I could count them  but I can't remember  there's an issue  that's why I drink it  did you think  you had more time  if it wasn't  for the injury  I do  I think the position  of goaltending  is one of experience  and if your body 
[00:55:30]  can hold up  big if  which is what  makes guys like  Prodeur incredible  you get experience  you're better at 35  than you were at 25  but the problem is  your body starts  breaking down  one way or another  you're getting slower  and even the athletes  that retire on their own terms  you know in quotes  they're not  they're slowing down  they realize  I'm not what I used to be  Wayne Gretzky had an amazing thing  he said look  I'm still a good player  in the NHL  but I can't stand  comparing myself  to what I was  and it's just  it's kind of depressing  if you used to score 90 goals  and you're only scoring 50 now  50 is great  but it's half of what you used to be 
[00:56:00]  and you can't live with that  just ask Steve Perry  from Journey  he doesn't sound that good anymore  no  and at some point  you've got to hang it up  and it's hard  it's hard to do  how many years did you play  I played 14 here in New York  that's a pretty good run right  it was fun  it was amazing  and you know  it's something you do  your whole life  and at one point  I think you're more ready  to retire when you're younger  than when you're older  because you've become that thing  and I retired at 36  and all of a sudden  you're like whoa  now what  you feel like you're 100 years old  and you are for hockey  but not for life 
[00:56:30]  so you know  you've got a lot  was it tough to adjust to that  hugely tough  I don't think anybody's prepared for it  and you know  I went back to school  I had left school  University of Wisconsin  as a sophomore  playing an Olympic team  minors then pros  and you know  that was my goal  that was my life  but at the time  I was just  I was starting a young family  so it was a good time  to kind of transition  but you're lost  and it's hard  and it's good to have  your network  but I think that's the biggest thing  is every day you're going there  a guy played with  Ryan Greshner  a funny guy 
[00:57:00]  you know  here in the Rangers  said you know  someone said  what do you miss most about playing  he said  showering with 20 guys in the morning  but I mean  his point was  you have this family  you do everything with them  you do everything  they know everything about you  you know everything about them  and it is a family  and the tighter the team  the more success you have  and then one day you go  oh I'm done  and you're one of those  old guys now  and that's your life  really from  the time you remember anything  you were probably skating  and you know  playing hockey  you still play  I mean I love the game  but it's a little different 
[00:57:30]  was it awkward to go back  to the rink at first  or  yeah a little bit  you know  because what you don't want to do  you would visit  but then they're like  alright  we're 20 years removed  from our Stanley Cup finals  you know  our time's over  and it's great to reminisce  but it's the Rangers time now  and this is a different team  and they've got different challenges  and it's their time  so you don't want to  you know be part of that  living in the past thing  it's almost their time  oh no  it's almost their time  they've earned the right  to be there  and it's awesome  he's brutal  hey I mean  where are the Islanders  where are they 
[00:58:00]  I apologize for being in the finals  you did something really well  but there has to be that thing  when you're down 3-0  even though you're there  it's like I'd be like  this sucks  like we know  that we're in big trouble  it's been done one time  right where they came back  in one  someone said that too  the momentum changes so fast  you look at the games  that we played  we being the Rangers  played in LA  right  and they were so close  overtime  double overtime  we could be almost  three up right now  and I thought coming back here  I think a lot of people  have the Rangers underrated  and I still think they kind of do  and LA is as great  as they say they are 
[00:58:30]  that's a really tough team  but the Rangers are better  than I think people  give them credit for  and they came so close  and you come back home  there's these expectations  had they won last night  there'd be a lot of pressure  on LA to win  they do not want to go back 2-2  so Rangers I think  will win tomorrow  and then you just  that's a big F  that's a big F there Mike  that's a huge F  that's why you play the game  one game at a time  I think if you don't get shut out  that would be a nice thing  to take with you  jeez  to the golf course  he's brutal man  I know man  it looks like  it's approaching mid-June  and they're still playing  so they're doing something  I can't be an Islanders fan 
[00:59:00]  and then jump  and jump and start  rooting for the Rangers  I give you all the credit  in the world  it's a difficult place  you find yourself in life  and I know my team sucks  I know that  they have major problems  they have problems  but look  the Islanders are actually  a very good organization  they have a lot of talent there  I know some good people  that are involved in that  they have some excellent  I mean Tavares is unbelievable  the injury was really  a shame for him last year  he'll come back  he's young  that's a scary team  and that will change 
[00:59:30]  I mean you look at  those Edmonton Oilers  who end up with a dynasty  they didn't make  the Stanley Cup playoffs  the year before  they ended up winning  so it can change  and that's a good year  can I ask you  I don't really play hockey  or do any athletics  I pucks for a bit  when I was a boy  but what makes you want  to be the goalie  seems like the most  horrifying place to be  because everyone is trying  to smash the puck  past your face  and it's like  what makes you decide  that's what I want to do  you know actually  yes or no  I think you get  a lot of credit  sometimes too much  when the team wins 
[01:00:00]  and look when you lose  it is a team sport  and it is everybody  and I think a lot of goalies  I had two older brothers  it was a way I could  end up playing with them  because I wasn't strong enough  for fast enough to play  with guys a couple years  older than me  but you can always go in net  now you're playing against  not your peers  but older guys  so it helps you develop  I think a little bit quicker  I loved it though  I mean you're  you think about this  as a young kid  what do you want to do  you want to play  and goalies  didn't have to shift  on and off  I was only going  on my team  for probably the first  15 years of my life  you go in  and you're in 
[01:00:30]  that's it  and there's days  where you stink  there's days where  you're not getting  physically hurt  but emotionally  it can be  disappointing  to lose the game  and feel like  it was on you  but that's also  what kind of  compels you to play  you have the game  in your hands  it's actually fun  how do you see  those slap shots  that's crazy  I was thinking  the same thing  last night  these guys  are so big now  and they're getting  in front of the guys  so well  and a lot of it  is you watch  somebody like Quick  or Lundqvist  who are so good  about taking away  they play percentages  like anybody else  we know that  a certain percentage  80% of the goals 
[01:01:00]  are scored  on the lower  half of the net  take away the bottom  of the net  these guys are big  their feet go  almost post  the post  it's 6 feet wide  it's crazy  take away the middle  you know last night  I'm reading the paper  today Lundqvist  had I think  three goals  two of them were tips  one was an attempted pass  and it went right back  to the guy  and slam dunked it  so three goals  and 15 shots  doesn't sound good  he played a great game  it was a tough game  to play  what are the differences  in the pads  since from when  you were playing  to now  how much bigger  are they now  like I am  and they try to make  the pads wide  to cover up  a lot of stuff  because they stood 
[01:01:30]  kind of upright  nowadays these guys  go down  and the pads are tall  and so these guys  are amazing  as I said  toe to toe  they're post to post  and then they close  the middle  it's not easy  to score  the agility is crazy  and when you watch  some of the old games  and just watch  these guys drop  to their knees  and kick one leg out  and it's like  you don't even see  anyone do that anymore  they instantly  do a ballet split  and save the rebound  I mean these guys  are actually pretty soft  when a guy's coming in  shooting a puck  a hundred miles an hour  somehow hits their pad 
[01:02:00]  and drops  and they have no rebound  it's crazy  what kind of a cup  are you wearing  in that situation  tatini  I never did  it really helped me  focus  exactly  get nicked on the helmet  that is an all or nothing  kind of goalie  you'd be praying  for one in the head  yeah  wow  is it a regular  it's got to be better  than a regular cup  it is  it's like a boxing cup  I mean it's got to be  really big and strong  and you know  everything now  all the equipment  in all sports  are better  you see these  the sticks these guys have 
[01:02:30]  in 1998  the women's  you know  Olympic team  it was the first year  for women's  in ice hockey  in the Olympics  and  that's adorable  there's about four or five girls  that can shoot the puck  from the point hard  and get it in the air  I was out with them  in Lake Placid  about four years later  they were ripping the puck  and a lot of these new sticks  I mean they just  so the goalie's equipment  then has  you know  it's a little bit  environment space  these guys get better sticks  goalies have to get  better lighter stuff  and they do  it's amazing  have you ever been  beaten up on the ice  I'm always amazed  by these guys  who fight  they're just holding 
[01:03:00]  each other up  and punching each other  and I'm like  that's kind of  it's probably less scary  that way  because you know  the guy's not going  to kick you  he's not going  to stop you  but it's just  embarrassing  to be beaten up  on fucking skates  when I was in Wisconsin  I had a teacher  go you know  is that like  is that like wrestling  is that kind of an act  is that part of it  am I  yes  no you know  with the blood coming out  and the tooth being lost  that actually hurts  and that's another reason  to play goalie by the way  you don't really have  to do your own fights  big guys will handle that  oh man  you lay a hand on the goalie  it's over Johnny 
[01:03:30]  with that though  I've got to ask you  what beef do you have  with the other goalie  that there's some action  happening  and now you have to  meet him at center ice  to fight the goalie  and you see it  every once in a while  it happens  that is the dumbest thing  it really is  I love it  because you guys  weren't bumping  into each other  and trash talking  and try to find a place  you can punch a goalie  I mean you've got to  get him in the head  because everybody else  is covered you know  where are you going to get him  I always found that funny  especially in all the  older hockey games  where the goalies  had to square off  for whatever reason  and then they've got to go down the ice  and it takes about 10 minutes 
[01:04:00]  to get there in the wrestling  dude the period's over  how come the goalies  would square up  because they  why would they  the last two hours  because they were two weakest guys  in the ice  they're not going to take the tough guy  bench clearing brawls  and all of a sudden  you see the goalies  meet at  yeah meeting  in a serious way  one way it does happen  is if it's for whatever reason  your team has five  and my team has four  and now two guys  are beating up one  goalie's kind of compelled  to go in  so you're  even it up a little bit  so then the other goalie  says that goalie  going in  I kind of miss the fighting  in hockey  I'll be honest with you  now you've got a couple 
[01:04:30]  of forces on every team  that fight pretty much  and that's about it  well think about it  if you're the commissioner  of the league  you are  look  part of the game  it's a hugely passionate game  and guys lose it out there  and it's part of the raw energy  of it  and fights have historically  been part of it  where it's not like  a premeditated thing  necessarily  it's like  alright you hit me  you hit me once  you hit me twice  I won you  and now it's like  poof  those are off  and on it goes  and it sells the game  and at the same time  a lot of people are like  why don't you eliminate that  so I mean that's  if you're the guy  it's a balance  but if you're at the game 
[01:05:00]  when a fight happens  even the little kids  are like on their chairs  they're checking it out  the excitement's unbelievable  look man  I grew up in Philadelphia  and if they're getting you  you're going to beat up on them  you know what I was noticing  also  they're playing so fast  these days  that if you take a hit  personally  and start a beef  with someone  you're really taking yourself  out of the game  it's unbelievable  for that moment  I noticed a lot of plays  even last night  a lot of hits  and I was thinking to myself  wow he should really  take that personally  that was a nasty 
[01:05:30]  nasty hit  but I guess you've got to  get right back  into the game  you've got to suck it up  you can't have a thin skin  right right  and just start like  you're offended by every hit  but you know the smart players  in all sports  they'll mark your number  and go okay  we're going to win  it's a 1-1 game right now  but you have 5-5  I'm going to pop them  right in the face  but how do you wait  how do you wait  when you want to punch  someone in the face  you've got to punch  them immediately  slow Sicilian revenge thing  how great is it though  when you're just standing  by yourself on the goal  and all this shit's happening  on the other end of the ice  that's got to be so relaxing 
[01:06:00]  how nice is that  you know there's no one  bothering you  you know what  there was periods  of the game last night  where Lundqvist  didn't have a lot of action  and then it's hard  because you know  you're going to get it  and it could be 15 minutes  it could be 5 minutes  but you're going to get that shot  and it could be a great one  now you're kind of cold  just watching  and also you're a spectator  instead of a participant  you can almost get hypnotized  right  yeah that's when  mental toughness is a big part  wow yeah  I love the agreement  some guys have  like there is all sorts  of fights going on  and you grab a guy  and you're like  you don't want to fight  do you  nah I don't either  they're holding each other 
[01:06:30]  look at that guy over there  how's the wife and kids  but I love it  it's so funny  because they're holding on  kind of  but they  I really don't want to get hitched  there's an agreement  there like  we're not going to fight  on this one  you know it's true too  I mean the amazing thing  is everybody knows  everybody in the league  right  so I mean you may have  just been traded  from the Islanders  now you're in the Rangers  one thing about the sport  you set it yourself  to getting stronger  and faster  what do you think  about expanding the rinks  that's been something  that has been discussed  for a long time  yeah and I think  it's something 
[01:07:00]  they need to look at  just because  there's just so little ice  and I think one of the things  you always want to do  you know when I played  one of the most gifted guys  out there is Brian Leach  the dude could get  you know a puck  and go from one end  to the other  if you put him in a room  as small as a studio  and there's eight other guys there  you're not going to see  his genius  you just can't keep  bumping into guys  that are inferior  to his skating ability  and that neutralizes  a bad guy shouldn't  neutralize a good guy  whether it's basketball  or hockey or whatever  you want to see  those great players play  and so a bigger rink  means that you have  more ice  if you're a superior 
[01:07:30]  skater to me  you're going to dance  around me  if you have the room  so you see that  in the Olympics  and so you get a glimmer  on how good it can be  and the Olympics  is pretty damn good hockey  what is the problem  with that  what are the issues  I'd say number one  you're taking seats out  ah boy  they can figure out  a way to make  that money out  somehow  but it is  it's a retrofit  of an arena  so if you have  your sheet is  whatever it is  200 long  and you want to  expand it a little bit  now  you literally have to  jackhammer up  how much would you think  that they would have  to expand it  like 6 inches  or more  oh no  8 to 10 
[01:08:00]  it's about 15 feet  on either side  it can be really big  15 feet  I can't remember  what the international  is but it's significant  and when you're out there  as a goalie  the forwards  they feel it  because there's more  ice to maneuver  the defense  I think is the hardest  on because now guys  you can't just push them  up against the wall  they have another 10 feet  on either side  to really get around you  I think it would be  great to expand it  but then put the seats  back on the ice  and people would have  to sit there 
[01:08:30]  and just take it  run out of the game  you know  have a player  fly in  take out 10 seats  they slip on their way  to the fucking seat  with coffee  beer in hand  and his hot dog  and cheeks split open  I just feel like  they're not going  to have a choice  in a few more years  I do wonder  because like you're saying  you have to make  these decisions so fast  I think the biggest thing  is what's the entertainment value  because ultimately  this is an entertainment  all sports are  and you say  what's going to give us  the best product  and honestly  every time you go  to the Olympics  now the hard part is 
[01:09:00]  you're looking at  all-star teams  you're looking at  the best in Russia  versus the best in Canada  versus the best in the United States  five teams  Swedes  Finns  Russians  they all feel like  they can win  the gold medal  each year  and they should  they're amazing  so you are seeing  all-star teams  but the quality of play  is so good  on those big ice surfaces  so it's something  that a lot of people  talk about  look at four and four  you take one guy  off each team  in overtime  during the race season  all of a sudden  there's ice  and that's the big thing  you want to see  the great players move  how many Olympic teams 
[01:09:30]  were you involved in?  I was in three  three  amazing  I was one as an amateur  in 88  before I played  the Rangers  and then two as a pro  so yeah it's awesome  it's a cool thing  how many of you  Jimmy?  I dropped out  no no no  I pucked for a couple of years  as a boy  but I hurt my ankle  doing ballet  it's a long story  yes it is  oh my god  what are you promoting?  let's get some business  taken care of  Brandon Steiner is not here  unfortunately his wife 
[01:10:00]  fell six  oh no  I was just going to curse him  no I was all morning  until I actually heard  there's a real excuse  so his wife is quite ill  so I wish her well  and him  but actually  we're going  there's the core four  as Brandon likes to call it  Adam Graves  Brian Leach  and Mark Messy  and myself  are going to be at the  92nd Street Y  on Friday  oh nice  in the evening  and we're having a  question and answer session  I don't know how they came up  with the core four  apparently fab four was taken  yes  you'll get sued for that  yes  mediocre three was taken by us 
[01:10:30]  but no it's awesome  you know these guys are my friends  and I mean they feel like family to me  but I always learn something  you have like a  a relaxed atmosphere  to actually  have canned questions  and answers  but then the people  from the stands  can ask  so we can mingle around  if there is a game five  which we all know  there will be  sure  it'll start a little bit earlier  so you can watch the game  afterwards at 530  but it's at the  92nd Street Y  it'll be awesome  well you just casually said  you went back to school  it says 
[01:11:00]  Richter enrolled in  Yale University  and received his degree  in ethics  yeah what's that  it's good  I did enroll  I was never accepted  oh okay  exactly  he applied for a job  I just showed up  wow  I wrote NASA  to be an astronaut  doesn't mean I was one  so would you go back  for four years  I had two years left  and it took me four years  to get them done  if that's any indication  of how I was at Yale  no I mean it was awesome  I just  I wanted to be around  the New York area  I applied to the best schools  I could get into  returning as an adult  I mean I'm 38 years old 
[01:11:30]  it's a little different  but it was awesome  it really was  my college career  was in a way  cut short  you know  playing the Olympic team  then on to the pros  and I figured  that would be a way  when you end  it is hard  and it's a way  of doing something  because first thing  people say  oh man you just retired  what are you doing now  and you're like  ah washing my car  I don't know  that's what everyone  thinks when they hear  retired  it's like just  around the house  trying to figure out  what to do  but go back to school  I had young kids  growing up  I went back to school  and finished off a degree  and then you go on 
[01:12:00]  with your life  so it was helpful  where you at with  you know  kids going right to the pros  we think that you should  if you have the opportunity  to make millions of dollars  why would you stay in college  aren't we all in college  to try to get a good job  that pays well  so I was in Philadelphia  when Kobe Bryant  was coming up  and this kid  17 years old  yeah and they're like  this kid's an idiot  what is he doing  he's giving up  a college scholarship  but I would preface this  by saying  there are very few  of those Kobe Bryant  so when you're  that kind of  can't miss guy  I think you should  the window to play  on the pros  is very narrow  you don't say 
[01:12:30]  you know  I'm going to finish  this degree  and then maybe  take a year off  to travel Europe  and then you come back  at 29  and try to make the  it's not going to happen  when that thing opens  and by the way  it doesn't just open  because you're really  good right now  they're looking at you  and saying  hey man  you're 18  and you're 165 pounds  and you need to put  20 pounds on  and learn how to  play a pro game  there is actually  true development  that goes on  in baseball  you always saw  in the triple A  and all that  in hockey  it's become that too  so you might leave  college like I did  and have a lot of  growing to do  and I need it  to go to the minors  and I mean 
[01:13:00]  I was kind of disappointed  I'm like what  I thought I was so good  and I'm like no  I mean you have so much  to learn  get yourself down there  play a pro game  I went from playing  42 games  or 45 games  in the Western Hockey League  at Wisconsin  awesome place to develop  to playing 88 games  in the minors  it's a different mindset  you're getting off a bus  playing 5 and 8 games  in 4 different cities  you know  you start to develop  how to apply your skill  but the other side of that  is you're playing  in the college there  and you get an injury  that messes up  your whole chance  that's another way  of looking at it  that's another risk 
[01:13:30]  you blow out of New Year's  and the next thing  you know  you're not going to  go to the NBA  if Kobe Bryant  didn't make it  well he's got a couple  million dollars in the bank  and now go back to school  how bad is that?  you have to be careful  where I think  it starts to become  discussion is on the cusp  where you're an okay player  there's no slam dunk  you'll ever make it  you have a college scholarship  and you're a freshman  you go  screw it  I'm going to put a square peg  in a round hole  I'm going  and even the team  might not want you  and you just end up  languishing in the minors  now you're dumped out  somewhere you didn't  make the money  and you kind of  sacrificed 
[01:14:00]  but they talk about it  like you can never  go back to college  that's the silly part  of that argument  you're exactly right  you can always go back  I mean at 38  you can still go back  did they know you  when you went back  by the way  the other students  do they all like  oh my god  I think I was that old  who is this old guy  that's kind of sucked  when you're going back  and you're just a regular guy  you know it was great  I mean you either  contribute or you don't  in class  they treat you very very well  so it was awesome  that's what you want  what fraternity did you pledge  yeah  I would have worn  my fucking jersey  and skates 
[01:14:30]  he was a Stanley Cup  winning goalie  that went back to school  and didn't do his homework  honestly you know  it is funny  because you're in  such a different place  like I'm going home  to change diapers  you know  these guys are like  hey party now  I'm like oh man  I've got a whole  different life ahead of me  so it was great  it was an awesome experience  so you just walked  around campus like that  right  you know actually  I volunteered  I helped out  with the coaching staff  with the team  they had a great team there  in fact I mean  my brother did note  as soon as I left  they became a very good team 
[01:15:00]  so I said you know  they're just slow  to get my system  yeah you loosened it up  for them  and your numbers retired right  it is yeah  it's at the guard  the Rangers don't retire  a lot of numbers  they didn't for a while  and then they seemed like  they finally started  catching up a little bit  but for most of the time  they did  no and I think at the time  again when you  and your job gets finished  all of a sudden  it's like yeah  I remember the GM  Glenn Sater saying  you know we're going to  retire your number  and at the time  like it felt good  but I think you're  thinking about  oh I just lost my career 
[01:15:30]  like it's great  the numbers retired  but I wouldn't be playing  and you don't  it's not until years later  you go holy  you know the first time  I came back to the garden  just to watch a game  and your number's up there  it's amazing  because that doesn't change  and you don't feel like  it's a great thing  when your number  was retired  there were only a few others  how many  three or four  something like that  and Roger Bear  that was it  you were the third  yeah  unreal  that's a hell of an honor  I guess they grabbed  a couple from that  94 team  a couple from 94  and you know what  it's no coincidence  these are special players 
[01:16:00]  and special guys  it is  it was a great team  I'll give it to you  there you go  that didn't feel so bad  did it  say it again  but this team  is not winning  oh this team  is not winning  not only is this team  great right now  they're young  and they're going to be  great for a couple of years  I don't see anybody  in these getting better  than them next year  so something to look for  what about your Flyers  Flyers are a tough team  they are a tough team  and they look like  they have very good  goaltending now  you know  Rangers handled them  really well  in that first round  I don't think  a lot of people 
[01:16:30]  anticipated that  Rangers kind of  upped their game  a little bit more  Flyers probably have  a few young guys  that they have to develop  but they're better  they'll be better  next year  but they're not  going to catch  the Rangers  in my opinion  when the fans  are like banging  on the glass  and stuff  is that annoying  not if they're  banging for you  when they're  banging against you  and are you happy  there's glass  you can't really  hear what they're  saying about  your mother  I can read  that's an A-Pretty  do they ever say  things that are  inappropriate  there was a couple 
[01:17:00]  inappropriate things  thrown my way  things that are  not related to the game  apparently they thought  they were  you know what's  funny is in the  minors you really  hear it  because I mean  we were playing  like Indianapolis  and you know  the place can hold  12, 15,000  there might be  3,000 people  in the seat  so if someone  wants to get on you  it's going to echo  there was a couple  of references  to various parts  of cows  and my sister's  swallowing ability  at one point  oh wow  especially since  cows are female  that's even hotter  I called my sister  I'm like  when's the last time 
[01:17:30]  you've been here  where were you  in Indianapolis  Mike Richter  can you tell  the Rangers fans  to leave  Dennis Potvin  alone  that's enough  already  enough already  for a year  he's been retired  for what  25 years  I think Dennis  has some thick skin  you know  actually  it's a sign  of respect  though isn't it  they usually  don't get on  the guy who's  no good  and Dennis  was an amazing  player  and yeah  I think it's  really cool  the Rangers fans  have that long 
[01:18:00]  memory  and they have  a great mystery  so  do the players  feel it  when you guys  play the Islanders  the Rangers  Islanders games  are just so much  fun  they are  so much fun  fights in the  stands  and I think  people who don't  experience  are like  alright  that's the hype  on TV  and radio  right  it's not  guys come  and trade  to the team  like  you know  I heard  about this  and I didn't  really get it  oh my god  you know  some mean nothing  game in the  middle of February  one team might be  out of the playoffs  and you know  the other one  over the years  it could be 
[01:18:30]  either of us  but that game  means everything  it does  it's bragging rights  and you know  obviously there's  a huge kind of  rivalry  New York is a rivalry  with everybody  but I mean  within you know  how many miles away  are you  oh yeah  that Long Island  Railroad would be  just a light  with people yelling  at each other  but don't forget  you know  you go to Long Island  there's plenty of  Ranger fans there  and plenty of  Islander fans there  so it is just  what do you mean  plenty  sometimes there's more  Rangers fans at  Nassau Coliseum  well I mean  if they go to  the Barkley Center  that may change  right  I don't know  if it's going to 
[01:19:00]  have the same vibe  I don't know  if it will either  right  it's a different  feel  but it might be  a new start  too you know  well we need  to do something  that Coliseum  is just a  disaster  it's an older  place  but I tell you  that's a pretty  damn good young  team they have  this guy needs  to talk to you  Chris in Hoboken  we got Mike Richter  in studio  Chris go ahead  hey Richter  two things  you were talking  about the fans  do you remember  seeing the one  sign I think  it was  someone played  in Boston  Tyler Seguin  or however you  say his name  had to sign up 
[01:19:30]  on the glass  and said  we sucked  your dick  in high school  jeez  you know  I don't think  they get a lot  of air time  on NBC  I didn't see  unless you're  live  you probably  missed that  one  that might  have been  across the  line  a little  how great  is that  the reason  I called  is I just  wanted to say  I've been  at a lot  of sporting  events  the greatest  sporting event  I was ever  at in my  entire life  and I was  at the  Mato game  my dad  and I  sat at game  seven  against Vancouver  and it was  the greatest  father son 
[01:20:00]  moment  so I just  wanted to  personally  thank you  and I  appreciate  you guys  giving me  the chance  to do it  with Mike  that's  very cool  thanks man  well you  know I  mean honestly  it goes both  ways  you know  mess is always  kind of  I thought it  was cool  when he got  to stay  on the cup  he went  right over  to the fans  you know  and let them  touch it  and all  because I  think that's  when it kind  of clicks  in a lot  of players  minds  holy smokes  I'm representing  the city  here you know  so it goes  both ways  the players  thank the fans  it's amazing  there's another  call  Paul from the  Bronx  Paul  yeah hey  guys  Mike I just  wanted to ask  you  sometimes it 
[01:20:30]  seems like  the fans are  more enthusiastic  about the game  and the players  and when you  have a rivalry  like the Rangers  and Islanders  they play  differently  and when you're  in the playoffs  they play  differently  it seems like  they should be  playing every  game that hard  and that you  know serious  can I answer  that question  Mike  yes in the  back row  I think they  have to pace  themselves  it's a brutal  sport  they do have  to pace  themselves to  a degree  I mean  honestly though  it used to  be in hockey  you'd say  oh man  16 teams  make the playoffs  you're going 
[01:21:00]  to be a  short  and not  now  great teams  don't make  it  and the  Islanders  were not  a bad  team  and they  didn't  make it  this year  so you  have to  fight  down  and look  the Rangers  were a couple  points out  too  right  and they're  in the  final  so I think  you have to  kind of  claw and scratch  your way  there  I just think  you're right  though  82 games  there's fatigue  that sets in  there's guys  that are injured  that are still  in the lineup  but you don't  see that  necessarily  in the stats  but they're  kind of  working through  an injury  but I think  kind of  everything stops  when you do  play those  rivalries  and that's  a good thing  because you  need to  the year 
[01:21:30]  is pretty  damn intense  even the  regular season  but it's  punctuated by  those special  games  and those  things are  always  imagine if  some of  these sports  cut down  their games  we're talking  about baseball  162 games  in the year  2014  it doesn't  make sense  anymore  you bring up  a really good  point though  look if I'm  the commissioner  I want there  to be 200  games because  you're selling  a product  right  but at the  same time  you know  the players  association  with football  are saying  these guys  are having  a hard time  walking by  the end  of the year  let's cut  down the  number of  games  the intensity  would go  way up  cut it down  to five  games  charge a 
[01:22:00]  ticket  absolutely  people say  Jim you're  an asshole  but I don't  think so  that's for  other reasons  you might be  right  but those  shortened seasons  coming back  from a strike  or whatever  every game  is a completely  different feel  yeah it is  and it's a little  bit of a game  of attrition  like you look  at even the  Stanley Cup  playoffs  coming into  this the Rangers  have played  20 games  and LA  have played  21 in  every one  of those  games  there's a lot  of overtime  they're all  intense  they're exhausted  mentally  physically  and they just  keep going  and going  and going 
[01:22:30]  so by the end  of this  if this one  goes seven  games  it could be  28 games  that's more  than a third  of a season  that's a lot  of hockey  to play  and Mass  said that  a couple  years  they were  in the finals  maybe four  to five  years  it starts  to take  a toll  that's almost  like another  year or two  season  and it's the  intense guy  do you develop  a dislike  for sports  writers  I'm wondering  sometimes they're  legit in their  criticism  you know honestly  and I think  you look at  the older guys  they know  the sports  writers have  a job to do  and sometimes 
[01:23:00]  they're going  to be saying  you stunk  today  and deep  down you know  you did  I don't think  there's too many  times people say  you stink  when you just  didn't  but it's never  good to hear  or read  and they have  a job to do  and so it's not  always going to be  pretty  and their job  is they're not  paid to make  you happy  are you happy  there wasn't  a Twitter  and Facebook  back  it's actually  it is different  man  you know  it's an easy  way to get  into trouble  but also  these guys  also have a way  of communicating  with their fans  in a pretty cool  way  so you gotta  be careful  obviously  but I think 
[01:23:30]  everybody jumps  on that  and just says  you know  how can we  again we're  selling a product  whether you're  a team  a league  or an individual  player  you're pushing  a product  but now  everyone has  a voice  instead of  just the sports  writers  now just some  guy  can say there  and go  you sucked  last night  and you gotta  read that  and be like  oh man  and it's hard  not to take that  because you read  10 columns  or 10 blurbs  about yourself  and you know  two guys  saying you're  the worst  players ever  you know  walked to the  face of the  earth  you know  I don't know  if 10%  of the people  out there  think it  but 10% 
[01:24:00]  of the people  just read  did  so it's  a little bit  of a skewed  perspective  you know  I know  Terry Bradshaw  and older  players like that  they used to  say they never  would read the  press  they're either  giving you  too much  credit or too  little  you know  if you're a  good player  you know  what you  should be  doing  and you  should have  a higher  standard  now you  can't really  stay away  from it  how can you  not read it  though  they probably  just didn't  want to give  the sports  writers the  satisfaction  of knowing  what is your  name  you have a  relationship  with the guys  and they have 
[01:24:30]  a job to do  and you understand  that  for the most  part  honestly  there's a lot  of respect  going both  ways  we're being  told you  gotta catch  a train  I have to  catch a train  I'm gonna go  to the Y  right now  and just wait  because it's  such a good  event  it's gonna be  a great  thing  we actually  have a good  friend that's  part of the  ranger organization  that we're  doing a signing  up in  Westchester  on Saturday  Matty Lock  and a good  friend of ours  has cancer  and we're  doing a little  bit of a  fundraiser for  him  but the Y  on Friday  night is  gonna be a  blast  the core  four 
[01:25:00]  and call  Steiner Sports  do we have  a number  here  we should  have a  number  Steiner Sports  steinersports.com  for tickets  and it's a  celebration of  the rangers  94 Stanley Cup  championship  oh he's involved  with the whole  92nd Street  Y thing  yeah he's awesome  he does so much  charity  I gotta ask you  one more thing  though  when the other  team pulls their  goalie  how much  are you thinking  I'd like to  score  you know  it's  you get the puck  and you stick  I don't know  I want to  score  but I really  wish I had  a better  wrist shot  because right 
[01:25:30]  now  all I'm doing  is setting  that mouth  if I try  for this  yeah  yeah  yeah  that's why  you know  so few  have done  it  it's actually  it's not as  easy as it looks  have you ever  goalie for all  that stuff  I've gone for it  but no  but you are  thinking like  I could do  that  when you have  a two goal  lead  right  you can  get one up  there's 60  seconds left  to go in a game  it's like  green light  that's great  what about  those open  net goals  though  yeah  for your stats  for my stats 
[01:26:00]  anyways  we had  you're like  fuck  guys thanks  for having me  on that  I didn't want  to like you  I know that  but I like  Mike Richter  I got to say  I brought you  a coffee  I want to  adhere myself  to you  but I end up  doing it  thanks Mike  come back  and see you  yeah  thanks 10  for having me  people are  not appreciating  the sporting 
[01:26:30]  way  I asked him  how old  he was  when he  started  pucking  started  pucking  that's the way  you talked  to a hockey player  that was  so douchey  I'm glad  he didn't  acknowledge it  and just  fucking  plowed through  and gave you  an answer  like you asked  a mature  adult  question  he was  good  he was  great  definitely  I didn't  want to  like him  he's a good  guy man  it was fun  pretty cool  Mike Richter  wow  oh that's  there's the  sign  Tyler 
[01:27:00]  that's a fake  sign  is it  I believe  so  yeah I heard  it's a photoshop  I've heard  I don't know  Tyler number  19  I think  I think  they might  have proven  it was fake  or something  I wasn't  sure  he's laughing  but  and the girls  are waving  and smiling  but  I don't know  I don't know  urban legend  yeah  perhaps  hello  hello  yeah  what's up  um  yeah  I was just  wondering  if Howard Stern  has given up  when he stopped 
[01:27:30]  doing radio shows  what happens  to you  when you  give up  we're not sure  what you mean sir  please clarify  yeah what are you  talking about  what do you mean  you're not working  Fridays anymore  are you  and why does  that bother you  what does that  have to do  with your life  and what you're  doing  because  your phone  is really  crapping out  we're not  I'm not doing  a bit  you actually  your phone  is honestly  crapping out  yeah why  would that  bother you  bother me 
[01:28:00]  a time  I'm going to  open your mouth  and be funny  I can't hear  I see  you're funny  now you can  say it again  your phone's back  go ahead  you're going to  be funny for me  hello  yes  so what are you  saying when we  take off on  Fridays  right  why does that  bother you  and what  it bothers me  because I'm  the listener  and you're  going to  open that  mouth  it's going  to be funny 
[01:28:30]  for me  I understand  what you're  saying  he wants us  to be  entertaining  for him  we're supposed  to be funny  for him  hopefully we're  funny for you  four days a week  that's pretty cool  it's cool  I think there's  a lot of  discussion  about the  Fridays thing  the fact is  that we saved  up all our  vacation time  so we could  do Fridays  off in the  summer  and then we'll  see what  happens after  that  okay that  makes sense  then  I thought  you just  but that  is the  truth 
[01:29:00]  haters are  going to  hate  and we  gave them  a nice  one to  really go  for  but the  fact is  anyone that  listens to  the show  on a regular  basis knows  we barely  took any  time off  we took  a little  time around  Christmas  and here  and there  we missed  a day  sure  but it  turns out  that we  didn't even  come close  to using  up all our  vacation  as far as  our two  week long  vacations  with cruises  and things  like that  it just  didn't  pan out  this year  so  right now  enjoy your  vacation  I'm sorry 
[01:29:30]  wow it's that  easy to turn  some of these  guys around  that's all  it takes  a little  explanation  in the end  we're not  taking any  extra days  as far as  to the end  of the contract  and we'll see  what happens  after that  I found out  Wednesday  on a Wednesday  afternoon  no one  none of you  guys tell me  Kenny just  goes we're  off Fridays  from now on  thank you  goody  goody  I thought  everyone knew  nobody tells  me  I actually 
[01:30:00]  used it  as an  excuse  to have  a few  beers  last night  I saw  that  because I'm  like well  it's Monday  right  right  but we're  off Friday  so it's  like a  Tuesday  right  but then  the show  is done  for the  Monday  so you  can really  push it  to another  day  so it was  like Wednesday  nice  so  who doesn't  have a beer  on the hump  day  what day  is it now  this is like  Thursday now  right  no it still  feels like  a Tuesday  I don't  know  but what  day does  it feel  like  kind of  like a  Wednesday  feels like 
[01:30:30]  a Wednesday  almost a  Thursday  I'm feeling  it  yeah  yeah  well but  so that's  that's that  then  done  yeah  oh trust me  they wouldn't  allow us to  take extra  days  Jesus  that's why  I laughed  at all that  when all that  shit hit the  fan  I'm like  do these  guys understand  this company  would never  allow us to  just take  extra days  yeah  we figured out  a while ago  okay if we  suck it up  and you know  save our days  and maybe we  can enjoy  you know  the summer  a little bit  there's no extra 
[01:31:00]  days involved  here  no  you think this  company's gonna  go oh you  guys want  Fridays off  now  no problem  and we'll  redo the studio  right  this is more  uninformed people  that think they  know what the  fuck's going  on  I know  no  they would  not just  give us  extra days  off  I talked  to somebody  that works  there and  knows  yeah  how's  Tracy Morgan  doing  it looks like  he's gonna  make a recovery  which is  fucking great  pretty beat up  I guess  yeah  but they said 
[01:31:30]  leg ribs  nose  yeah  ribs  and a  femur  there was  a weird  rumor that  they're not  gonna take  his leg  after all  or something  I heard  something  about an  amputation  that's the  rumor that  was going  around  that they  were gonna  take his  leg  and that's  bullshit  was that  bullshit  that one  yeah  that's  bullshit  and then  well first  of all  Artie Fuqua  how's he  doing  no news  on him  Jimmy  you know  anything  on Artie  do not  know  because  all the 
[01:32:00]  news has  been about  Tracy  yeah  so it's  like you  know  this  I don't  know  anybody  I've  met his  family  but I  don't  know  them  well  and  I  don't  know  anybody  that's  actually  gone  to the  hospital  because  I don't  think  you'd be  able  because  Tracy  is  a  celebrity  I  think  that  they  would  probably  have  it  on  like  kind  of  like  lockdown  because  I  would  love to  go see  Artie  I've  texted  him  and I  have  not  heard  back  but  again  that's  not  untypical  for  Artie  right  literally  I was  carrying out  a conversation  with him  probably a week  ago  on text  three days  later  he got  back to me  and wrote  like ha ha ha  like it's  something I  had said  he's just 
[01:32:30]  busy  yeah  it just  seems like  a lot of  people have  been to the  hospital  at this  point  so it's  kind of  strange  that no  info has  come out  about Artie  yeah  I mean  hopefully  he's  okay  I'm  very concerned  about him  we love  him  Artie's  man  he's funny  and he's  just a  a little  problem  with TMZ  yeah  they had a  video up  I don't know  if it's still  there  of one of  the guys  being taken  out of  the limbo  bus  yep  and the 
[01:33:00]  problem I  have is  really simple  they  you know  they have  a problem  with language  and this  and that  and they  put their  asterix  and stuff  but they  have no  problem  showing this  isn't this  way worse  than not  spelling out  the n-word  or  voyeuristic  gruesomeness  this is  way worse  than language  it's  pandering  yeah  absolutely  worse  than language  that shit  drives me nuts  it's like  oh oh  you know  yeah  we can't  spell out  you know  the n-word  but  we have no  problem  showing this 
[01:33:30]  this is  horrific  yeah  video shot  just after  crash  panic in  the streets  the crash  scene  hmm  it's just  there's no rhyme  or reason to it  I guess  is what I'm  trying to say  yep  you know  we don't  have to play  the video  they know where  it is  if they want  to suit  themselves  but  fuck it  yeah  it was really  gruesome  and just  unnecessary  I don't know  I don't think  that's  I'm not even saying  it's unnecessary  but 
[01:34:00]  you know  if you're gonna  show this  that's what I'm saying  that  in my stupid world  that's way more  offensive  than putting the word  faggot up there  or something  yeah  yeah  yeah  and having to put  asterisks in  yes  then you should  just do it all  yeah  you know  they're basically  saying language  this is bad  if someone sees  the actual word  printed out  on our website  that's shocking  that's offensive  that  is upsetting  to people  meanwhile  you're watching  somebody get  carried out 
[01:34:30]  of a vehicle  right  it's really  gruesome  wow  what a disaster  I can't see it  man  when machines  fucking hit each other  there was a guy  just driving by  he filmed it  there's another one  though  yeah  where you actually  see them carrying out  Tracy or something  they say it's Tracy  yeah  can't really tell  I don't know  it's just very  voyeuristic  yeah  it's just kind of  gross  I mean  yeah  I don't think  it's  I don't know  it's not news  it's 
[01:35:00]  this guy works  at the hospital  where Tracy's at  go ahead Anthony  hey what's up boys  hey man  hey  yeah it was funny  because they sent out  an email  they actually fired  a nurse  it's kind of sickening  they  I guess she posted  it to Facebook  so  they sent out  some privacy reminder  email  I've been there  three years  and  Robert Johnson  cares about  patients and privacy  just remember  that it's illegal  to post things  on social media  network websites  blah blah blah  you're not allowed  to talk to the press 
[01:35:30]  it's grounds for legal action  and blah blah blah  so I guess they fired  one of the nurses  over it already  what had she done  she had posted  I guess she took a picture  of Tracy  and she posted  to Facebook  and said  oh I'm taking care  of him  or whatever  oh boy  cunt  bye bye  that's bad  don't you think  Anthony  that's gross  yes I do  I'll write with that gag  it's bad  unless I was  you know  that's a hospital  right  if you had your camera  you know  take a picture  it's completely outrageous  that someone would  yeah  do that  I don't know 
[01:36:00]  I could see where  she was let go  for that  I think that's a chance  you're taken  in this new world  no  yeah  I don't know  alright  you can't photograph  a patient  and put them on  I know  people  still are privacy  if you're in the hospital  yeah  your medical stuff  right  people are ridiculous  with their goddamn cameras  we got apologies today  I hope so  are we a day in  with no apologies  I don't think anyone  I don't think anyone  not to my knowledge  Woods and Niles  you know Woods and Niles  sir  not to my knowledge 
[01:36:30]  oh  the other thing on Tracy  the driver didn't sleep  for 24 hours  before the crash  yeah  what was that about  isn't that great  just working too hard  tons of machinery  hurtling down the highway  with no one  at the controls  literally  because he's asleep  holy shit  that's frightening  and he was avoiding  another accident  I guess  oh he was  was he  that was  yeah  supposedly  and then what did it say  on his Facebook  was it his Facebook  that said  move out of the way  or get hit  yeah  his profile 
[01:37:00]  his Twitter account  Twitter account  but he changed that  man  you know  obviously  we all hope  everybody gets better  but what a lawsuit  oh my goodness  yeah  Walmart  Walmart's had a rough  couple of days  I mean this  and then that shooting  in the fucking parking lot  right  it's such a big store  I mean there's a lot  of people that go there  things are bound to happen  but  that's a rough couple of days  for that company  damn  yeah  this 
[01:37:30]  this  motherfuckers  this VA thing  is driving me nuts  more than  57,000 veterans  waiting for health care  more than three months  who's  more than 57,000 veterans  have been waiting  for up to three months  for medical appointments  the VA department  said in a wide ranging audit  released Monday  an additional 64,000  who enrolled for VA health care  over the past decade  have never been seen  by a doctor  according to the audit  well thank god  the illegal Mexicans  that are streaming  over the border  are getting the health care 
[01:38:00]  they need  yeah  and Bradley Manning  thank god  was a sex change  or given the harm  or whatever  sex change  for a  traitorous  fucking  tranny  I've had it  why are they waiting  so long  does anyone know  a little more  about this shit  this fake patriotism  we have  where we say  hey let's love the troops  let's be good to the troops  because it sounds good  and you can never  speak against the troops  but when it comes  time to like  whether it's  giving the money 
[01:38:30]  to the fucking  first responders  at the towers  or doing this  they're just scumbags  in this day and age  there's nothing  real about anything  there's no substance  anything  as long as you can  blurt out  USA  yeah  support the troops  it doesn't matter  if you really do  you said it  and that's all that it takes  it's like the apologies  they don't mean anything either  there's no substance  to them  there's no substance  to anyone saying anything  so when they say  respect the troops  love the troops  support the troops  and then they're dying  before they can even 
[01:39:00]  get medical attention  at the VA hospitals  it's a fucking  travesty  how about you don't  talk about the troops  you just take care of them  when they come back  they should be much happier  than to hear your fucking  your nonsense  yellow ribbons  and your flags  and all that  just really take care of them  actually take care of them  give them like  when they want to go to the doctor  how about you let them  go to the doctor  within a week  and not wait three fucking months  and not wait three months  with a diagnosed aneurysm  so he can die  before he gets any treatment  it's ridiculous  it's more of the 
[01:39:30]  phony bullshit  that is just ruining  this country  our whole culture  it's all what you say  it sounds like an old man thing  to say  but it is  it's what's being said  instead of what's being done  gotta take care of our veterans  Jesus  yeah  that seems like a no brainer  well we tribute them verbally  and then things like that  on the news  Chris Daugherty is a terrible person  because he walked off  right  how could he walk off  how about you  why don't you bring people  who are holding up the health care  on the Fox morning show  and go hey scumbag  why are the people not getting 
[01:40:00]  what they're supposed to get  lambast them  Chris has more on this  in New York  Chris  yes Opie  what's going on  hey  I got a stat for you  I heard it on Sean Hannity  yesterday about the VA hospitals  there's 1.1  one doctor  for every 35 vets  right now  but in Guantanamo  there's 1.1 doctor  for each  terrorist we got  in Guantanamo Bay  can you imagine that  great  how many terrorists  we got over there  quite a bit  but how many  5,000 
[01:40:30]  I don't believe  I don't believe that stat  that sounds  completely insane  unless there's 10 people there  that's what I'm saying  there's over 100  you're trying to tell me  there's close to 100 doctors there  there's no way  I'm just telling you  what I heard  yeah I understand  we're trying to figure out  just regurgitating  what you heard  on faux news  I think it's horrible  what's going on  with the vets  but that stat  seems completely insane  well even if it's half true 
[01:41:00]  can you just imagine  that they're more worried  about these fucking terrorists  they are our own guys  the terrorists  and again  the illegals  that are piling  piling over the border  right now  there's all kinds of aid  that the democrats  and Obama  of course  want to give  to all these  children  these refugee children  that are crossing  the border  on a daily basis  and then they're taking  these illegals  dumping them  in the southern border  states  like Arizona 
[01:41:30]  and just  dumping them  at bus stations  wherever you want to go  there's  truck stops  at bus stops  they're  they're not  arresting them  they're not  deporting anyone  anymore  the deporting rate  when it plummeted  under Obama  it's embarrassing  because  and even Bush  didn't fuck  with the illegals  he didn't  because they have  such a strong  voting base  the Latin voting base  is very strong  nobody really wants  to turn them 
[01:42:00]  against them  if you imagine  if my 5 year old  was moving around  Central Park  by himself  the house  locking me up  Toronto  yeah exactly  but you know  that's ok  and then we got  a marine in Mexico  who's in jail  down there  and what does he get  oh I know  how come they don't  return him  we take care  of all these  Mexicans  that come over  the border  with medical  attention  schooling  food  shelter  and  they make  a mean taco 
[01:42:30]  so we gotta  take care of them  what can we do  I don't know  about that marine  though  I've heard the story  about how he  legitimately made  a wrong turn  and he called  911 from right  over there  and goes  I made a wrong turn  you know what  I'm willing to give  him the benefit  of the doubt  based on the evidence  no one's really  denying the fact  that he did say  that he had  guns in the trunk  they were legally  owned by him  and he  inadvertently  ventured into 
[01:43:00]  Mexico  don't you have to  go through  customs though  to do that  I don't think  everywhere  not everywhere  there's border  crosses where you  can just drive in  yeah as a matter  of fact  there's certain  places that you're  not supposed to  cross that you  can  oh okay  yeah  it's like a  bridge  regardless  yeah there's  definitely some  unanswered questions  but you know  what the fuck  give the guy  back  at least  try to get  him back  what the hell 
[01:43:30]  stupid  Kerry doing  he really is a  boob  John Kerry  he's another  one  between Hillary  and Kerry  what big  accomplishments  have our  Secretary of  States  done  there's nothing  do they ever  do I mean  I'm honestly  there's no  answer for it  I just don't  know what  they normally  do  what do they  normally do  when you have  a president  with a very  strong foreign  policy  and very strong  in foreign  affairs  you have a  Secretary of  State that  does things  you look at  someone like  Kissinger 
[01:44:00]  back in the  Nixon days  and who was  Madeleine Albright  they did  stuff  what did she  do I don't  even mean  that was a lot  with the Soviet  Union  and it was  a lot of  talk with  NATO  and the  Warsaw Pact  countries about  missile placements  and I understand  it was a  different time  but you got  to adjust  and do  something  these motherfuckers  are doing  nothing  and that's  why  Putin's  blitzkrieging 
[01:44:30]  his way  across the  Baltics  which is fine  with me  and any  foreign  I don't care  what he does  I don't care  either  I don't care  but people are  questioning why  he's so brash  and doing it  it's not  the barn door  has been  open  and he's  running  amok  because of  the weak  United States  and weak  president  you got  people pissed  off  of course  Chris in  California  go ahead  Chris  saying the  illegals don't  get all those 
[01:45:00]  benefits  yeah they do  yes they do  they get  emergency room  care  believe me  if there's a  mother and a  child that  crossed the  border  and the  child got  injured  and she  took him  to the  hospital  he's getting  medical  attention  well yeah  yeah  yeah and  meanwhile the  veterans got  to wait  that's just  human decency  I don't mind  a kid getting  out of my  decency sir  I don't mind  a kid getting  medical attention  after we  I believe the  children are the  future  after what we 
[01:45:30]  do here is  taken care of  with veterans  and other people  that are living  here legally  well there's no  human decency  on that side of  the issue  no  obviously  we're being  invaded  no one  realizes it's  an invasion  you know  fuck  we're uh  you know  we're on the  other side of  today's show  we're getting  closer to the  end here  and you still  haven't done  the big  I told you  so  that's in  the paper  today  I told  you so  do you know  which one  I'm talking  about  no 
[01:46:00]  I think  I do  not at all  Jimmy  Anthony  for like  everyone who  was saying  that I would  not return  to San  Francisco  but Anthony  said I  would  and that my  COBS tickets  would go on  sale today  for August  7th through  9th  nobody  believes him  I know  I kept  saying it  and saying  it  is it  the  Donald  Sterling  thing  no  who is  now not  selling the  team  which is a  great story  too  I'll tell you  why it's a  great story  because  I don't  know how  the deal  was going  down  it seems  like the  wife was  more involved  than him 
[01:46:30]  but he was  sort of  agreeing  this is  kind of  what I  I've  picked up  but I  think Sterling  got really  pissed off  because he  finally realized  that even  if he sells  the team  the NBA  is not  going to lift  the lifetime  ban and that  pissed him  the fuck  off  and I think  he wants his  fucking money  back from the  fine out of  principle  so when he  realized that  shit wasn't  going down  he's like  you know what  fuck you  and then he  told his lawyers  let's go forward  with this lawsuit  against the NBA  for I think a 
[01:47:00]  billion dollars  and he got  in a way  I kind of  like this  I love it  because he  got the  the problem  was that  bitch  illegally  according to  him  recorded him  illegally  if he didn't  know  that was  an illegal  place  you can't  use that  in court  right  it has  to be said  because people  only listen  to it half  in a year  I think  Donald Sterling  is a shitty  guy  I have a  pretty good  feeling  he's a  shitty  guy  but he  got railroaded  in his  house  yeah  I don't care  private conversations 
[01:47:30]  yes  exactly  and that is  very bothersome  here  yep  and now  he's basically  moving forward  I think if the  NBA said  alright  if you sell  the team  we'll lift  the lifetime  ban  maybe that  makes it  a little easier  he saves  a little face  but when you  find out  they're not  doing that  he's like  alright  well fuck  you then  let's do  this  and the way  they treat  the players  how many  of these  guys  not all  of them  of course  but a lot  of them  have criminal  records  and have  committed  violent  it's like  it's just  such fucking  nonsense  over shit  he said  to his  girlfriend  and everyone 
[01:48:00]  knew he was  a shitty guy  that did  shitty things  but the commissioner  and the NBA  in general  kind of looked  the other way  until it got  into the mainstream  here  but everyone  in the know  and in basketball  knew that  this guy  might not be  the greatest  so I kind of  like that he's  suing  I think that  was it  right  oh but  I told you  so  I mean  started to  prosecute  the lawsuit  on page  statement  okay  his statement  on Monday 
[01:48:30]  was  the team  is not  for sale  from the onset  I did not  want to sell  the LA Clippers  so  I've decided  I must fight  to protect  my rights  Donald Sterling  said  while my  position  may not  be popular  I believe  that my  rights  to privacy  and the  preservation  of my  rights  to due  process  should not  be trampled  I love  the team  and have  dedicated  33 years  of my life  to the  organization  I intend  to fight  to keep  the team  which means  this team  is going  to be  a complete  disaster  they're not 
[01:49:00]  going to get  players  coming to  this team  and that's  the free  market  deciding  of course  and then  I don't  blame players  that wouldn't  want to  play for  him  I really  don't  fuck  this guy  I can  go to  this team  or his  team  fuck  him  but I  bet your  players  do go  if you  offer  them  enough  money  they'll  be the  guys  that  don't  have  as many  choices  as  others  I would  assume  there was  never  discussion  involving 
[01:49:30]  the NBA  in which  we would  modify  Mr. Sterling's  penalty  in any way  whatsoever  any suggestion  otherwise is  complete fabrication  NBA spokesman  Mike Bassett  so that  means  you know  they wanted  to keep  the lifetime  ban  and all  that  yeah  well  there you  go  so  now you  gotta find  him in court  oh boy  that's gonna  be very  very interesting  do you  got your  told you  so yet  I don't  I'm trying  to figure  it out  no  I know  what it is  well the  the numbers  in New York  City are  not good  and you  said this  would happen  with de Blasio 
[01:50:00]  oh yes  right  okay  shootings  spike in  New York  City over  the last  year  not only  the last  year  the last  couple of  months  which is  yeah  de Blasio's  time  the number  of shooting  victims  has skyrocketed  across the  city this  year  up 43%  in just  the last  month  yeah  oh because  the stop  and frisk  doesn't happen  exactly  while fewer  guns are  coming off  the streets  NYPD  statistics  reveal  police  commissioner  bill  bratton  has  repeatedly  shifted  the focus  from  shootings  to a 
[01:50:30]  steep  decline  in  homicides  and claims  he is  not worried  about the  gun violence  but sources  told the  post it  will only  get worse  in the  hotter  summer  months  and that  the alarming  trend is  the result  of a  more reactive  police force  handicapped  by the  inability  to use  tactics  like stop  and frisk  yeah so  all the people  are like  just use  good police  for it  okay  what does  that mean  mopping up  the bodies  that's pretty  much it  these neighborhoods  will talk  nobody's  going to say  a crime  is about  to be  committed  and you  can't  stop  and frisk  so I  guess  basically  these  neighborhoods  you just  got to 
[01:51:00]  take it  the numbers  don't lie  man  just take  it  you asked  for it  this is what  you wanted  you wanted  it and  now you got  it  in the last  month alone  so I guess  that would be  May  129 people  were shot  according to  the latest  comp stat figures  or 43.3%  more than from  the same period  last year  since January  there has been  an overall  13.2%  increase  in shooting  victims  with 10.2%  fewer guns  have been  recovered  compared to  2013  yeah  fucking  asshole  de Blasio 
[01:51:30]  you just  listen to  all the  stats  and everything  and people  go  well  Anthony  stop and  frisk  it's against  the constitution  it wasn't  just a  random  you know  wheel someone  over  and frisk  them  there had  to be  some  type  of  suspicion  you know  and I'm  sure  believe me  I'm not  dummy  I know  the cops  will look  and go  well I  saw  something  but  again  you know  it's in  it's in  the bad  neighborhoods  you're the 
[01:52:00]  people that  are affected  people in  the bad  neighborhoods  and they  don't want  to talk  to the  police  they don't  want to  fucking  you know  so  you made  your bed  lie in it  it's like  what do you  want  yeah  what do you  like I  was just  about one  time  I like  what are  you supposed  to do  to stop  it  good police  work  fair enough  what is  good police  work  yeah  like I  know you  can't just  stop people  because of  how they  look  that is a  really shitty  way to be  but if you're  in a certain  neighborhood and the  cops kind of know  who's  if you're looking 
[01:52:30]  for fucking  mobsters  you don't  stop you know  little old  Jewish women  right  right  well the  well the  fact of the  matter is  over 80%  of the  gun crime  is committed  by minorities  in New York  City  well over 80%  I think it was  closer to 93  and  they  that's who you  want to  look for  as far as  weapons go  that's who  you're looking  for  so when they  say why  are the  minorities  the ones  that are  getting  stopped and 
[01:53:00]  frisked on  suspicion of  having a  weapon  well because  that's who  has the  weapons  yeah but  if you said  that  if you came  out and said  that even  Bloomberg would  have had you  fired and he  was the one  pushing stop  and frisk  what was it  Christine Todd  Whitman's  the guy who  ran the  head trooper  said that  there's like  why are more  black people  getting arrested  he goes  because they're  committing more  crimes  and he was  fired  he was  fired  well Bloomberg  said at  one point  we're not  even stopping  and frisking  we should be  stopping and  frisking more  black people  he said  because as 
[01:53:30]  far as the  percentage of  the crime went  to the  percentage  of people  that were  being stopped  and frisked  it still  didn't  balance out  but you  can't say  that apparently  I guess  you can't  do that  you can't  do it  so now  you know  deal with it  and if it  stays up  in the  shitty  neighborhoods  I could  give a  flying fuck  go ahead  kill yourselves  it's when  it starts  oozing down  into the  good parts  of town  and the  crime  and shootings  start encroaching  on civilized  humans that  are trying  to live a  life and  fucking  conduct  business 
[01:54:00]  that's when  things will  happen again  I feel bad  for most people  in those  neighborhoods  though  because they're  the ones  a lot of  people in those  neighborhoods  were for it  because they  don't want to  have to deal  with it  they're the ones  getting shot at  they're the ones  whose family members  are getting robbed  then fucking  do something  group up  do something  more than  prayers  and anti-gun  fucking things  it's the  degenerates  in the neighborhood  that are fucking  you  not white man  not fucking  guns  it's the 
[01:54:30]  degenerate  fucking  animals  that are  killing  your kids  your grandmas  everyone else  that gets hit  because of  poor aim  and  that's the deal  if you want it  fixed  let the police  do their work  or fucking  do something  yourselves  unite  unite for good  not to defend  fucking  you know  some drug dealer  that got shot  by a cop  fucking  hey  unite for good  sweep your  fucking porch  sweep your 
[01:55:00]  patios  clean the streets  fucking  speak English  in your home  so your kid  can fill out  a job application  when he gets older  right  for the love  of Christ  on a pony  hello  oh  my  god  hey guys  guys  on a serious  note  on a serious  note  what was I  doing  fucking  what was I  hey everybody 
[01:55:30]  woohoo  the neighborhood's  a pretty band  don't you know  woohoo  we gotta  stop the  violence  woohoo  don't you know  kids are getting  killed  and she just  babbles over  a bit  like an idiot  you're doing a bit  you shut your  yap  you can't yell at her  for being bad at radio  she didn't fucking  pick the phone up 
[01:56:00]  this is not bad at radio  trust me  she's not good at radio  she's great at radio  just in a different way  she's an idiot  listen  hey  listen  listen to me  on a serious note  I heard you babbling  over the bibs  saying something  about Marion  no I said  Marion and I  feel bad  about what happened  why can't it just be  you  feel bad  about what happened 
[01:56:30]  why does it always  have to be you guys  have to get together  on something  because Marion  Marion can't call you guys  all the time  but you can  but you can  so how about you just  speak for yourself  alright well  whatever  but you know  I just wanted to say  that I  feel bad about what happened  with Tracy Morgan  yeah  how do you  I remember him  from years ago  yeah  alright  and I just feel bad  and I hope he recovers  wow you've really added  a lot to the topic  I think everyone 
[01:57:00]  feels the same as you  I wanted to say  the same  I wanted to say  but why do you need  to call us  to tell us that  I would assume  you would feel bad  like anyone else  that has ever  come in contact  or has any type  of relationship  with Tracy Morgan  and one more time  Marion feels bad too  you know  and hearing  this call  actually makes me  envy Tracy right now  oh you shut the hell up 
[01:57:30]  it's not funny  you don't know funny  what do you know  about funny  what do I know  about funny  I listen to you guys  don't I  you don't  but you don't  really listen to us  you don't really get it  you don't really  you don't get it  because  and it was  in the middle  of the bit  based on  your stupidity  that was really  could have went  somewhere  and the whole time  Marion  yelling over him  you're just like  a cat  looking at a pinwheel  you just see 
[01:58:00]  the pretty colors  but you don't know  the physics  behind how it works  right  okay  you have no idea  why you listen  to our show  do you  no no  none  I was just  trying to get  a point across  that's all  there was no  point to  a point on your head  what was  there was no  point there  we can take  phone calls  all day long  from people  that are like  hoping Tracy  gets better  yeah  well  yeah that's true too  and I hope he does  cool thank you for the call  your concern  has been duly noted

[02:00:30]  on me  alright  Kevin in Houston  we're not going to get  a surprise guest  I just want to  I don't think so  that's our surprise guest  possibly  oh okay  within a half hour  I doubt it  I don't know why  we can't announce it  but  I guess we can  I guess we can  why  no  Kevin go ahead  real fast  and then we're  going to move on  can Diana please  just chill herself  and do us all  a fucking favor  ma'am  it's not every morning 
[02:01:00]  it's only when we  might be running out  of material  no no no  hold on  I'm here  it's every morning  it's not every morning  it's every morning  it's not Friday mornings  anymore  alright  let's see  stop saying stuff like that  whoever you want  the claims we're dead broke  after leaving the White House  yep  fucking Christ  I think that's  I think that's bullshit  yeah  there's no way  a president is dead broke  leaving the White House  they said there were  a lot of legal bills  I bet he was in debt  I bet there was a lot of debt  but I bet they had money 
[02:01:30]  and you know  I don't know  I mean  you don't think  they're getting envelopes  yeah  you don't think  they're getting set up  a little bit  and then there's  earnings potential  you're an ex-president  getting out of the White House  oh I'm dead broke  you make a million dollars  for one speaking engagement  you know  you're pretty much set  right off the bat  right off the bat  so you're not broke  so he could  when was his first speech  after the White House  it's probably like  the day after  he left  he put his fucking  luggage in the car  so that's just 
[02:02:00]  a bullshit story  yeah  maybe technically  he was broke  but  he owned property  anywhere  or a house  he was set up nice  what  you have the clit  what  the audio  I don't feel like  playing the clip  I'd rather talk  to Lady Di  I wouldn't  what  the clip  or Lady Di  Lady Di  I would not  alright Lady Di  yes  look I wanted to  continue talking to you  but I lost this one  but I will return  oh  I'm not hanging up  well we will 
[02:02:30]  well it doesn't work  that way  yeah exactly  is this happening  you're fucking rummy  oh you don't know  we might have  Willie Nelson today  it's stupid to tease it  Willie Nelson  what's the problem  with telling people  that Willie Nelson  might stop by  why is it always a secret  why would that be a problem  why would that be a problem  Sam  Sam  Sam  explain  because he's probably  because he's probably  not coming  that's why I said  probably  so why  why can't we say  oh we were supposed  to get Willie Nelson  because otherwise  we would just move on 
[02:03:00]  with our show  and nobody would realize  that our guest wasn't  yeah but you use that  to make people  listen a little longer  Michael Jordan  might be stopping by  today too by the way  the actor Michael B. Jordan  I didn't want to like  spoil it for the people  but  oh  we're talking about people  that might stop by today  but Jordan's on that list  today as well  he's doing some stuff  here in New York  so  yeah  sneaker stuff  huh  sneaker stuff  no  pants  sneaker stuff  hats  Andrew  Long Island 
[02:03:30]  good morning gentlemen  good morning Andrew  we got a Clinton  clip we will be playing  in a second here  what do you got  alright  listen  remember that caller  who was calling up  yesterday  saying about  oh you guys  the show sucks  and all that  I forgot about him  as soon as I left here  but anyway  go ahead  yes  I wanted to call up  yesterday  and you know  do that  Hillary received  8 million dollars  for a book advance  while still in the  White House  yeah  where'd that go  so that was a 
[02:04:00]  guarantee  that was guaranteed  money she was going to get  but I guess she didn't  get any of it  until she left  the White House  officially  and then maybe  she got her first payment  well maybe they're not  allowed to take money  in the White House  maybe there's a  the family can't  make earning  yeah  maybe they're not  allowed to  so you can say  you're broke  technically  but you're not  right  she's not sleeping  in the car  they were 12 million  in debt  when leaving  office  oh wow  yeah they probably  made that up  lickety-split  Chelsea's education  yeah  Andrew thanks for  your call by the way 
[02:04:30]  alright so  the guy that got  resolved right there  I thought he had  a great call there  they had to pay off  debts and houses  and take care of  family members  right  and they had a  helping hand  wealthy Clinton  pal Terry McAuliffe  loaned the 1.3 million  for the purchase  of a home  and they went on  to earn  an astonishing  109 million  between 2000  and 2007  yeah  that's called  bouncing back  that is quite 
[02:05:00]  the best  they were never  broke broke  34 million  how'd they only pay  wait a minute  they paid 34 million  in taxes over that time  how do you only pay  34 million in taxes  on 109 million dollars  in income  right  deductions  right  but why  you know  if you're kind of  they're apparently  using every legal  loophole  that they can use  to save  some of their money  are they doing  their fair share  yeah  I mean 
[02:05:30]  that's like  what is it  30%  I love that  great  it's  it's bullshit  good for you  oh you know what  dude  legal debts too  don't for the  Paula Jones thing  there was all this  stuff  he had like  5 million  in legal debts  yeah  during a series  of actions  of Whitewater  oh yeah  Paula Jones  and impeachment trial  but the point is this  when they were sitting  in the White House  still  and they knew  they had some  of this debt  they also knew  they were set  totally set  that as soon as  they got out  they would be able  to you know  make their money  we got this  we're on the 
[02:06:00]  motherfucker  I don't think  they were ever  nervous  like real people  are when they  are in actual debt  with their electricity  being turned off  they were never  in any fucking  trouble  like if we don't  get re-signed  we can't go out  and make million  dollars speaking  engagements  yeah  of course  that's it  tell them niggas  to chill out  the wolf  will arrive shortly  he was all set up  he's fine  by the way  the Lady Di phone  calls have helped  people  this guy  was off the wagon  after 10 years 
[02:06:30]  of sobriety  then listening to  Lady Di  got him sober again  congrats  he's serious too  dead serious about it  here's Hillary Clinton  talking about  Benghazi  his voice  is there anything  you personally  should have been  doing to make  it safer  in Benghazi  what I did  was give very  direct instructions  that the people  who have the  expertise  and experience  in security  apply  well that is  personal though 
[02:07:00]  Diane  I mean  I am not  I'm not equipped  to sit and look  at blueprints  to determine  where the blast walls  need to be  or where the  reinforcements  need to be  that's why we  hire people  who have that  expertise  there you go  that's good  what is it  she's bullshitting  about  ask the old  buck  how long  her  and  the upper  echelon  of Obama's  administration  including Obama  himself  knew  that  the security  at the  embassy 
[02:07:30]  was not  up to  snuff  and that  Americans  were sitting  ducks  and that  there were  terrorist  threats  and they  were actual  real live  terrorists  that  for the  purpose of  the anniversary  of 9-11  attacked  a United States  embassy  and killed  United States  citizens and  soldiers  and it  wasn't because  of a  Muslim  insulting  video  oh that's  right  that fucking 
[02:08:00]  the way  that people  blame that  guy  it's all  about  blame  anything  to take  the thing  off the  fact that  yeah they  attacked  us again  that they  got attacked  because the  election was  coming up  and they  did not  want  Obama was  saying you  know oh  we've defeated  terrorism  and tell the  Taliban and  Al Qaeda and  everybody and  we really don't  have to worry  about that  anymore and  the fact of  the matter  was that  they were  able to  kill  Americans  blow up  an embassy  and burn  it on 
[02:08:30]  the anniversary  of 9-11  and her  job was  not to  go through  blueprints  of blast  walls but  her job  was to  receive  communications  from people  and make  sure that  they're protected  she's the  secretary of  state  and the  president of  the United  States  should have  known better  it was a  very volatile  area  I'm starting  to think you  don't like  the Obama  administration 
[02:09:00]  I love it  I got my  suspicions  Hillary had  this to say  too  it has been  reported  you've made  5 million  making speeches  the president's  made more than  100 million  dollars  well  well  but you hear  Diane  I know  what the  fuck  why are you  surprised by this  yeah why are you  surprised  and she almost  sounds like she's  chastising her  for it  good  good for Hillary  if she could go 
[02:09:30]  out and bilk  people for 5  million bucks  for opening that  horrid yap of hers  and letting that  dribble spill out  over the podium  fuck her  she's a very  natural and  genuine speaker  I said  well what was  that line  something  no way  is tired  no way  is tired  do we have  that fucking  awful clip  I love  listening to it  it's terrible  you got it  I'm in no way  tired  yuck 
[02:10:00]  trying to talk  she was  dressing a bunch  of black  people  so she  decided that  she's going  to sound  black  oh here  it is  young  Samuel has  it  oh  I hope  yes  well over the  weekend  senator clinton  had her  campaign  I don't  feel  no ways  tired  I've  come too  far  from where  I started  from  nobody  told me  that the  road  would be  easy  I don't 
[02:10:30]  believe  he brought  me this  far  Hillary  Wigger  that but  that's  that's the  secretary of  state  she wants  to run  for president  who changes  her inflection  exactly  depending on  the audience  she's speaking  to  y'all  motherfuckers  are crazy  where are  my niggas  at  thank you  madam  president  foreign  policy  can kiss  my  motherfucking  ass  thank you 
[02:11:00]  madam  president  fucking  a  15  year  old  jimmy  norton  can't  go  exactly  fat  laces  secretary  of state  old lady  shoes  fat  orthotic  laces  she  continues  well  if  you  you have  no reason  to remember  but we  came out  of the  white  house  not only  dead  broke  but in  debt  we  had no  money  when we  got there  and we  struggled 
[02:11:30]  to  you know  piece  together  the  resources  for  mortgages  for  houses  for  chelsea's  education  you know  it was  not easy  wasn't  easy  that's  just  a lie  first of  all  it's  bullshit  that is  a complete  lie  she  knows  it was  they were  set up  it might  not have  been easy  for the  first  weekend  yeah  that's  just  she's  just  lying  earning  potential  of millions  of dollars  isn't quite  enough  for the  Clintons  so she  I guess 
[02:12:00]  she really  understands  what the  middle  class  is all  about  yeah  she was  on  food  stamps  yeah  that  is  just  not  true  yeah  you know  it was  not  easy  Bill  has  worked  really  hard  and it's  been  amazing  to me  he's  worked  very  hard  first of all  he worked  hard on that  intern  get it  he jizzed  all over  her dress  you bet  he windmilled  a cigar  into her  pussy  she won't  talk about  that by  the way  no  nope  Hillary 
[02:12:30]  won't even  address it  she's  telling  every  interviewer  that she  talks to  I will  not  discuss  the  situation  so they  should  still  bring it  up  they do  and she  goes  I will  not  talk  about  that  I've  moved on  yep  I heard  it this  morning  on  1010 wins  and technically  pardon me  it is her  private life  and it's her  husband  but  wasn't there  an impeachment  over that  it was huge  yeah  it was a  big public  debacle  there was  an issue 
[02:13:00]  there  a bit  of an  issue  first of all  we had to  pay off  all our  debts  which was  you know  you had to  make double  the money  because of  obviously  taxes  and then  pay off  the debts  and get us  houses  and take  care of  family members  but do you  think  Americans  are going  to understand  five times  the median  income  in this  country  for one  speech  well  let me put  it this  way  I thought  making  speeches  for money  was a much  better thing  than getting  connected  with any  one  group  or company 
[02:13:30]  as so  many  people  who leave  public  life  do  whether  you like  her  or don't  who gives  a fuck  making that  much money  off a speech  I have no  problem with that  people want to  see her talk  people want to  pay it  right  if they want  to pay it  so be it  people want to  see her talk  there's nothing  wrong with that  I'm not a fan  of Hillary Clinton  oh really  I'm not a fan  of most of  these  people  I understand  she's coming  to the building  but she'll only  do shade  we come  too far 
[02:14:00]  how could a  president go  broke  exactly  no one's  buying it  most people  aren't buying  that they were  actually broke  that it was  tough  it wasn't  tough  it was tough  because you  had to live  like a normal  like not a  normal person  but like a  person  outside the  White House  so I guess  the tough part  was going  holy fuck  we got to  get an actual  mortgage now  after eight  years  or even  longer  right  they probably  had free  housing before  they were  the president  in the White  House  I mean  so that was  probably what  she's talking 
[02:14:30]  about  like wait  we actually  got to get  a mortgage  so we got  to find a  guy I guess  and wait  we might have  to get a  student loan  for Chelsea  not a student  loan  come on  they didn't  have to get  a loan  or any of that  shit  but that set  that up  as well  like wait  how are we  going to pay  for a  schooling  this is  stuff we  never had  to think  about  five million  in legal  debts  though  you think  that someone  takes care  of that  for the  president  but I guess  not  I guess  he had his  accountants  and lawyers  working on it  I'm sure  and they  crunched the  numbers  and said  you get 
[02:15:00]  out there  and you do  a few speeches  we'll pay  this off  those debts  were gone  really quickly  extremely quickly  109 million  so it's  just lies  and the whole  thing she lied  about too  going into  the  sorry guys  I have a  tickle in my  throat  hope it's not  cancer  what is that  comedian  jokes himself  at the hospital  see the  fucking  headline  if I did  have it  big C  what is the  she lied  about going 
[02:15:30]  to that  fucking  day thing  that war  zone  on a plane  right  she's like  they were  shooting  yes  they were  shooting  she was  landing  was it  Iraq  at the time  she was  flying into  a war zone  I think  it was  Bosnia  where she  said she  was sniped  at or  something  yeah  they were  shooting  or something  and then it  proved to be  wrong  yeah  they said  it was  not true  wow  she was  actually  just  leisurely  fucking  flight  into  some  city  she's 
[02:16:00]  on a  fucking  united  flight  yeah  into  LaGuardia  right  yeah  I don't  know  it's just  depressing  to watch  these people  ramble on  the tinkle  death  so do I  yeah  I think  she's just  obviously  just stretching  the truth  you want to  share a urinal  not in a gay way  but just because  this way  we save water  that is  good  I don't  know how to  answer that  yeah  awkward  hey we bring in  like a little  apple box  and can stand  on it  and the three  of us  can just  wee into  the same  one  I'm gonna  pee on the  Mike Richter  hockey puck  oh man 
[02:16:30]  come on  Rangers got  another game  in them  they could  pull it out  yeah the  Kings might  do what's  called  lose on  purpose  so they  could  hoist  the cup  in LA  so I  would not  be surprised  whatsoever  if they  lose the  next game  that's taking  a chance  throwing the  game like  that so  you can  I don't  know  your boys  are done  your boys  are done  hey I'll  never uh  I'll never  give up on  my Rangers  I've been 
[02:17:00]  through 20  years of  this  yeah  have you  yes 20  years  of the radio  show  yeah  it's the last  time the Rangers  won the cup  we just  started  we just  started  that's how  long we've  been at  this  oh man  they're doing  the OJ  chase on  TV  when is  that  tonight  tomorrow  are they  really  showing it  yeah I  think it's  kind of  I think  they're gonna  they should  do it in  real time  wow  OJ  yeah  who would 
[02:17:30]  be the  uh  the  the anchor  back  then  Bernard  uh  who's the  black guy  Bernie  Bernie  uh  yes Bernie  Bernard Shaw  Bernard Shaw  wow  was he involved  with the OJ  chase  CNN  it was a  biggie  who were  some of  those other  CNN guys  back in the  day  Blitzer was  there  yeah  Wolfie  was  yeah  CBS News  special report  Dan Rather  in Los Angeles  along with our  colleagues at  KCBS  who arranged 
[02:18:00]  uh  this  extraordinary  bizarre  I won't fuck  any woman  who remembers  this  exactly  John Blackstone's  point was  that because  the police  believe  when people  started holding  the signs up  go OJ  it was amazing  like  cause after a while  watching this  you kinda knew  where he was  going  so they lined  the streets  and the bridges  over the freeway  with signs  that said  go OJ  remember he  turned into his  neighborhood  and was like  oh fuck  now he's gotta 
[02:18:30]  make some moves  yeah  this was so  fucking weird  this part was  easy  cuts his wife's  throat  but people like  him cause he  ran a football  well  yes  that's it  almost decapitates  his fucking  wife  no one wanted  to believe it  even Al Michaels  I think at the  time didn't  want to believe it  yeah  they were close  it's hard  if your friend  kills someone  how do you  handle it  man  I snuck a peek  at some of  those crime  photos last  night  the um  oh right  ugh  really  god what a  disastrous mess  so obvious 
[02:19:00]  it was him  like no one  just kills  someone like  that  there's no  murders  that happen  like that  where some  random person  comes up  and butchers  the woman  and this guy  that's with her  unless it's  personal  that's like  a  it's such  a textbook  thing  that that  that was a  crime of  passion  and and  OJ  having this  history of  anger and  jealousy with  her that he  did it  and then all 
[02:19:30]  the other  evidence  how this  motherfucker  walked on  that is  astounding  that whole  glove thing  oh they  showed that  whole thing  as the  prosecutors  you stop  that circus  and go wait  a minute  you're not  trying this  on properly  that's uh  they're all  like looking  in amazement  that's what  Ron Goldman's  dad what's  his name  Fred Goldman  Freddie Goldman  there he  was uh  commenting on  20 years  oh yeah  he only calls  OJ the  killer  right he  won't call  him OJ  Simpson  or anything  he just calls  him the  killer  oh yeah  I love that 
[02:20:00]  mustache  and uh  yeah he was  saying that  uh he doesn't  blame the  prosecution  uh it was a  weird time  uh but things  like that glove  really got him  right  because the  dried blood on  it and then  putting latex gloves  on OJ  and having  him try  to put  the glove  on  I'm not  a lawyer  but if you  make the  guy put a  plastic glove  on first  wouldn't that  raise your  suspicion like  wait a minute  that's gonna  be a problem  because those  type of gloves  too you know  they were 
[02:20:30]  supposed to  fit snug to  begin with  yeah  they weren't  those fitting  gloves that you  just throw on  in the middle  of winter to  throw a few  snowballs  the Mark  Furman thing  he talked  about that too  and said uh  you know if  Mark Furman  had uh  because times  are really bad  between the  LAPD and  the black  community there  so he said  if Mark  Furman had  lied and  said he  hadn't said  nigger back  years ago  then they  would have  exposed him  as a lying  racist  and if he  tells the 
[02:21:00]  truth  then he's  a racist  so there  was no  way he  was getting  any credibility  he said  and the  thought that  he planted  evidence  I think he  said he  was the  33rd  police officer  on that  scene  and he  plants  evidence  after 32  other officers  walked around  the scene  and were  looking for  evidence  was Van  Adder the  lead detective  on that case  yeah  it was  James Van  Adder  I think  he said  just uh  you know  in hindsight  you forget  how much 
[02:21:30]  of the  detail  there was  and how  obvious  it was  that he  did it  wasn't  this our  first  like look  at court  like  no one  in our  lifetimes  we never  saw anything  this invented  court TV  didn't it  pretty much  I think court TV  blossomed out  of the OJ  trial  but yeah  we used to  get little  glimpses  of cases  on specials  and things  like that  documentaries  maybe  but never  in real  time  day to  day  that grind 
[02:22:00]  of a  courtroom  just put  out there  live  Marsha  Clark  just  fucking  stinking  eyes  tried to  gussy  herself up  and get  that makeover  halfway through  the trial  rotten  perm  more important  to her  was  people  criticizing  her looks  than actually  prosecuting  the fucking  case  Chris Darden  stunk  just an  emasculated  brother  sitting there  while  Johnny Cochran  just played  him  Cochran was  a good  fucking 
[02:22:30]  lawyer  man  what a  scumbag  but man  did he  know exactly  what to do  he knew  exactly  what to  do  he made  fools  of the  prosecution  and then  I guess  the next  the other  thing  that's  coming out  on this  20th  anniversary  of this  whole  thing  is  Kardashian  Goldman  said  that  Kardashian  absolutely  took a  bag full  of evidence  and it  disappeared  and no  one ever  knew what  happened  to it  and he  took it  to his  deathbed  he grabbed 
[02:23:00]  a bunch  of stuff  out of  OJ's  house  had it  in a  bag  it's  actually  on video  somewhere  I remember  seeing him  leave the  house  with a  bag  what did  he say  it was  never said  it  never said  what it  was  never had  to say  what it  was  never  didn't  they call  him into  the trial  oh he  was he  was on  the dream  team  he was  one of  the attorneys  who  Robert  Kardashian  oh that's  right he  was the  attorney  yeah  so he  had you  know  attorney  client  privilege 
[02:23:30]  I guess  is that  why they  made him  one of  the dream  team  lawyers  maybe  attorney  client  privilege  maybe  but then  again  doesn't  attorney  client  privilege  get  nullified  if there's  a crime  committed  like didn't  Bruce Cutler  like  not saying  it's ethical  if he  doesn't  it's something  called  discovery  I guess  and whatever  evidence  the prosecution  finds  they have to  give over  to the defense  I learned  that from  my cousin  Vinnie  and  but if 
[02:24:00]  you  just  hide  the  evidence  or  destroy  it  or  bury  it  somewhere  but  Goldman  says  absolutely  had  evidence  that  would  have  convicted  OJ  and  he  destroyed  it  that  broke  up  the  marriage  too  because  Robert  Kardashian  was  all  for  OJ  and  what's  her name  Kris Jenner  right  yeah  that was  her friend  that was  murdered  yeah  people forget  that  people don't  even know  people that  watch  the Kardashians  they have 
[02:24:30]  no idea  that the  father  was  most of  them  have  no idea  the father  was  on one  of the  biggest  trials  ever  the girls  were all  very young  back then  they were  all  10, 11, 12  years old  somewhere around  there  someone's  saying that  OJ stopped  taking his  arthritis  medication  two days  before the  trial  so his  hands  would  swell up  oh  well  he could  have done  that  that one  of those  conspiracy  theories  out there  I never  heard that  one  you think  someone saw  that coming  like well  they might  make you  put the  glove on  you'd think  the lawyers  would be  on high 
[02:25:00]  alert  that you  know  this might  not go  well  so let's  be prepared  I gotta  pee  yeah I gotta  pee too  oh man  come on  right  alright  we'll return  we'll be back  with more  that's  hilarious  really  fuck  them  see  that's  why I  mentioned 
[02:25:30]  that we  might get  Willie Nelson  so then  when it  doesn't  happen  it really  fucking  hurts  I saw  Liam walking  down the  hall with  some really  tasty pastries  and a really  nice fruit bowl  fruit salad  whatever  and I said  who's that  for  and he goes  oh that was  for Willie Nelson  but he obviously  didn't touch it  yeah  Willie Nelson  has officially  left the building  so I guess  he's not doing  our show  where's Roland  for lying to us  surprised guest  because probably  we don't want 
[02:26:00]  it to get back  but  no I think  it's better  that we did  bring it up  oh yeah  I kind of  believed  I kind of  believed  that it  was going  to happen  I knew  it wasn't  we had him  on one  other time  I just  knew it  we had him  on at  NEW  he brought  in that  old guitar  with the  big hole  in it  because he's  been playing  it forever  that was  a long  time ago  his tour bus  was parked  outside  NEW  he was getting  high  before the  interview  oh yeah  right  maybe I  didn't 
[02:26:30]  love  shut up  it's a good  song  I would have  said hey  did you like  when Elvis  covered that  I liked it  fuck  what's wrong  with you  fuck  he's one  of our  national  treasurers  Willie Nelson  is he  yeah  he puts  corn  in his  gas tank  too  some kind  of corn  check it  out now  I'm  Willie R  Nelson  thank you  Jim  oh well  let's say  hi to Ivan  in Scranton  and we got  a call  from Denmark  what do you 
[02:27:00]  want  what's up  what's going  on guys  what's up  nothing  I know  you guys  always like  to not  really rag  but you  guys like  bust on  Adam Sandler  quite a bit  well  maybe  I think  the world  is starting  to realize  that he  might have  ran out  of creative  juice  that last  movie  didn't do  too well  huh  no not  too well  but  I was at  a casino  up in the  Poconos  and I ran  into the  guy that plays  Shooter McGavin  oh  what's his  real name  he's been  in a lot  of shit  Shooter  McGavin  yeah 
[02:27:30]  so I ran  into him  and he was  at the bar  just drinking  me and a couple  my buddies  were there  and we're  just hanging  out  and I kind  of knew  who he was  but I didn't  want to freak  him out  and be all  over him  and stuff  so we're  just sitting  there drinking  so that means  you left  the bar  and you went  somewhere else  right  is that what  happened  that's how  that story  should end  by the way  yes  so what  was your move  that he's  probably seen  a million times  and went  here's another  asshole  that's gonna  bother me  and all I want  is a beer  what was your 
[02:28:00]  move  I didn't really  have a move  I just kind  of just sat  there  and he was  sitting  like two  seats down  I told him  I actually  said like  oh yeah  I know  who you are  I didn't call  him Shooter  McGavin  I know  who you are  of course  you know  who he is  and I bet  you thought  he would be  excited to  talk about  Happy Gilmore  yeah  I'm Shooter  McGavin  right  do the hands  do the gun  hands  right  that's where  we're getting 
[02:28:30]  he ended up  playing for a while  we ended up  bullshitting  we ended up  playing pool  oh that's cool  that's when we  started playing pool  and we got down  to the last shot  and I had the  eight ball  I shot it  and as soon  as I sunk it  I did the shooter  thing with the fingers  and then he called  me an asshole  and he left  that's kind of  a good Shooter  McGavin story  to have  in the end  that's a good  story  what the hell  alright guys  I'm punching out  thanks a lot  alright  punch yourself  out in the face  fuck yeah  what happened  with the Willie Nelson  he's on the road 
[02:29:00]  again  oh Roland  that's a good one  he doesn't remember  us from years past  what happened  that's too bad  we had a good time  with him  I remember  that was one  of the good ones  he was very tired  so we're going to  reschedule  oh fuck that  yeah reschedule  reschedule  okay cool  you're always on my mind  you're always on one  when's he coming back  yeah  maybe I won't do your show  you don't like 
[02:29:30]  Willie Nelson  maybe I  if I made you feel sick of me  I love a good cover  as I've said before  if I made you feel sick of me 
[02:30:00]  well  so he's  that's alright  so we weren't on his mind  right  exactly  you are never on my mind  you're on the list  that's pay no mind  did you think it was going to happen  Roland  you can all kiss my behind  you felt pretty good about it  I felt pretty good  and then  they said  he was tired  I mean  oh boy  they're old  he's tired  we could  we would talk to him  for 15 minutes  we didn't say  sit down  we have a 2 hour  fucking Q&A with you

[02:34:30]  enough  don't be a hater  it's legalized in places now  it's fucking  everyone's smoking the weed  you really are a hater  you're a hater  I'm a hater  they even animated the Seth Rogen Snoop Dog  it's not outrageous  let's hear this  give them a little taste  Game of Thrones recap  and they're high as shit  that's funny  look at his eyes  I just watched it last night  for the first time  no no no  I watched the whole series  it's great isn't it 
[02:35:00]  the little midget  they keep  they keep saying  that cuz  he was in love with a whore  yeah  so he fucked around  and they was gonna give him some  his father was gonna hook him up  but he was like  he couldn't shut his ass up  so now he gonna have to fight  this big ass  gigantic motherfucker  who was such a  the queen wouldn't have got it  cause he killed  they think he killed Joffrey  yeah  they think he killed Joffrey  but he didn't kill Joffrey  uh  Peter  killed Joffrey  fuckin uh  what's his name  uh  Littlefingers  yeah  Peter 
[02:35:30]  yeah  and he's got  you should do a weekly  Game of Thrones  Unlily  I think he should put that on  before every episode  that's my shit  I fuck with the Game of Thrones  that's my shit  I'd watch the shit out of that  like how the smoke  turns green from the green screen  and then they're watching it  they're doing commentary  that's good shit  Snoop Dogg is a man dude 
[02:36:00]  he really is  get out the way  get out the way  get out the way  push that through the fuck  and he's called  moon door  get out the way  get out the way  get out the way  you know  sometimes it's the simple things  that don't work  I've only loved one woman  my whole life  would you ever be in one of those 
[02:36:30]  kind of movies  a Game of Thrones type shit  yeah sure  why the fuck not  would you  I'd love to do that shit  to be a motherfucking king  or something  or even to be a fucking gladiator  imagine having to listen to this shit though  this rambling stoned guy  one or two of those  Unsullied maybe  there you go  no they have dicks  just no balls  I think  or do they not have any  who cut it off  no real 
[02:37:00]  oh they didn't want that thing to be seen  that thing would come out that little suit  they'd be wearing  because they don't be having no drawers on  they're really having a little piece on  with the little  you know  all them niggas walking around  with that thang swinging  the queen would have to violate  my queen  your grace  yo grace  you bitch  you  preach  damn  alright  there you go  Snoop  takes balls man  so stop hating  yeah man  let's go back to hangover 
[02:37:30]  hangover  hangover  no  we were done with that  do you want to hear snoop and willie nelson  no  fuck  what is it  we've played it before  it's called my medicine  that's what I meant  but I didn't know  where is willie nelson in that though  I'd rather hear his hot pockets  fucking song  I love this song but is he actually singing on it  everything I'm reading says he's in it  yeah willie  willie's in this  oh  yeah  you know I got the head at medicine  I don't remember where  you know what he means by medicine right 
[02:38:00]  oh  weed  sheep  are you sure  weed  no right  oh yeah  a little subtle  a little subtle  it is subtle  ah  cause that's the only reason he did something with willie  they're both known for weed  so they gotta  they gotta sing a song about weed  buy my medicine  buy my medicine  his medicine  the more dedicated  the more medicated  ah  I do like though 
[02:38:30]  that he's got his girl going out to whore for him to buy his drugs  yeah  and this is not about weed by the way  this is about fucking like dope  shooting dope  yeah  yeah  are you sure  a hundred percent  can you talk about a spoon  oh he does have a spoon in there  yeah in the beginning  oh no boy  and his girlfriend's out  fucking hooking  proving marijuana's a gateway  drug there  chicks never hook for potty  let me write a nice song  about the sunshine  Godsmack's got a new song out  someone just told me on twitter  yeah they're in town now 
[02:39:00]  they are  yeah I've talked to uh  some of his friends with Sully  well fuck they should have stopped by  Sully stops by when he's doing solo stuff  let me hear the new Godsmack song  we go way back with these guys  15 years at least right  something like that  well from the time you threw their cassette out the window of your truck  well it happens  97 we probably met him  so 17 years ago  we know Sully 17 years  yeah  let me hear a little Godsmack  it's tough to put out a rock's arm these days 
[02:39:30]  it's really tough  what is it called  a thousand HP  do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do  no  not at all  but then it kicks in and it's good  I like the rest of it  yeah  it'll get used for a video game commercial or  WWE pay-per-view  Sully sounds great  17, 18 years later  holy fuck  sounds great  his voice sounds good  well produced  everyone's in their position  playing their instruments  yeah  just a little hokey 
[02:40:00]  a little hokey?  yeah the beginning  195  both verses  back in Boston  playing the club  talking about like  you know  being a hit overnight  you know  because of Rocco  yeah  instead of us  Rocco didn't throw the tape out the window  that is a true story  we got so many tapes  what are we gonna do?  I don't know  listen to every one  it's hard man 
[02:40:30]  people hand you their stuff  I feel bad  I'm like  what am I gonna do with this?  terrible  99.9% of it's shit  I threw it out the window over a bridge  just to make my friend laugh  that's all  had nothing to even do with Sully  because I  whatever  I'm trying to spin this  because I've always been a really big Godsmack fan  always liked those guys a lot  but it was about making my friend laugh  and I even thought to myself  there's got to be other copies in this around  it was their demo tape  Godsmack's demo 
[02:41:00]  he had a few  he burned a few  oh boy  he didn't just burn one for us  you know Rocco listened to it  he was like  dude these guys rock  I'm gonna play them on my show  and he gets the breaking of Godsmack story  yeah Sully has credited Rocco many times  yeah  could have had that little credit  oh well  we did show him shit videos though  so  we have our own history with him  it's true  German shit videos  before you could get him anywhere really 
[02:41:30]  he was amazed  now they're a dime a dozen  you had to buy a fishbowl and make him yourself  when I was your age  I had to get your mother to shit on a fishbowl  if I wanted to see a log coming out  you kids have it easy  a fishbowl  yeah  you break the fishbowl of a mallet  and you put your head in there  and then mother shits on it  mother  there's been a lot of hate in the last half hour  so let's organize this shit  Willie Nelson  yeah  thumbs up or down  I'm going to thumbs down 
[02:42:00]  still hating him  yep I'm hating  Psy and the Snoop Dogg  that is a  hangover  towering  steaming lump of shit  it stinks  Seth Rogen and Snoop doing the Game of Thrones  that was funny  okay  that was funny  enjoyable  and then finally Godsmack  I liked the music  I like Sully's voice  I like the band  the vocals in that first verse  were too hokey  I think it throws you off  but I think the rest of the song is pretty cool 
[02:42:30]  the rest of the song is kind of cool  I swear that's my real review  oh boy  the consumer  sorry the consumer  oh  hashtag the consumer  to the consumer  dare I do a review  yeah  that's his bit  right  yes  why don't you buy yourself a nice bag of fetid toenails  enjoy them  I was ready to be with you on the Godsmack thing  after that first  I know  the first verse  and then I'm like  you know what  no man  this is alright  it rock  that first part I just didn't like  like it was 1995  maybe they could re-edit it  just because we say so 
[02:43:00]  it rock  didn't the new Godsmack  kind of sound like  when Pendulum was redone  it's sort of that  like  well it's that sound  in that fake grunge rock  yeah but the Pendulum guy  was going for the  it's that sound  yeah  he was going for that sound  right  he was going for the  kind of Godsmack thing  which was you know  it's just tough to be a rock band these days  especially if you were around  in the 90s  tough  it's  I'm sure Godsmack  still sells a lot of tickets 
[02:43:30]  they're classic fucking rock  man  like fucking  90s  is classic rock  80s is oldies  fucking oldies  crazy  I don't even know what the 70s are  they're almost hip again  70s came back around  70s styles  and all that shit  now  usually takes I guess  what 35-40 years  then the generation grows up  and their kids are like  wow that was kind of cool  yeah  that's like rockabilly  dig through their parents shit 
[02:44:00]  and find something  and think it's cool  do you like rockabilly  hate it  I never liked rockabilly  I mean a couple  straight cat songs  were kind of  alright  as pop songs  but I don't like that style  at all  won't be rocking this town  no  I was talking to the lead singer  of Gollum yesterday  who was featured in the  Louis C.K. episode  last night  which I still haven't seen  the band  I don't know  how they did  but she's excited  because she got the big  Louis C.K. show  it's this 
[02:44:30]  this like kind of  Yiddish type of music  oh right  yes  with fucking  accordions  and all sorts of stuff  they're really talented  local band called  Gollum  or Gollum  how do you say their name  whatever  G-O-L-L-U-M  I don't know  Gollum maybe  and I was talking to her yesterday  because  I just know her  whatever  oh  and  our kids kind of  might be going to the same school  oh  I see  and  she's excited  but she's like 
[02:45:00]  no one buys  CDs anymore  or even downloads them  for money anymore  because of Spotify  how the fuck did the audience  watch Spotify  happen  how did the managers  allow that to happen  and what is Spotify  I mean I know what Spotify is  but what  how much do you pay  you pay like ten dollars  and you can just listen  to whatever the fuck you want  right  well you can get it for free  and you can listen with ads  right  or  you pay ten bucks a month  and yeah  you listen to whatever you want  it's streaming  but you can also download  within the app  they pay  they must pay royalties 
[02:45:30]  oh she says  dirt  it's like  not even pennies on the dollar  it's like  there was a band  it's like fractions of pennies on the dollar  there was  there was a band  that figured out  how to make money off of it though  yeah  they put out an album on Spotify  that had no music on it  and then they got all their fans  to listen to it  while they were asleep  so all their fans  listen to it for eight hours  and you get paid per stream  and it goes in a cycle  so they had thousands of people  do this 
[02:46:00]  and it was on  and so Spotify had to pay them  however many thousand dollars  brilliant  yeah  but don't they  like Bette Midler  had so many plays  and that they  and they gave her some shit check  like they pay nothing  right  the artists get fucked on that  and then I was talking to some other people  and like  if you're  if you're 30 even  you don't even understand  what a disc jockey is  or like  listening to a radio station  you have no real concept  you know it happened  but you have no  you don't have any personal experience 
[02:46:30]  because  you know  anyone from 30 and younger  they were downloading  all their own music  and basically making their own  like radio station  they can't be bothered  to sit through nonsense  to maybe hear their favorite song  they can't be bothered  to actually listen to a DJ  talking between songs  they don't understand  that world at all  yeah  Napster started early in high school  so then once Napster started  then CD Burners came out  right after that  so 30  I mean definitely like  30  no not 30  so you go the other way 
[02:47:00]  so like  late 20s  25  to the late 20s  those people have no concept  of just listening to your favorite radio station  and having loyalty to that  and having loyalty to an actual music show  don't get any of that shit  of course  yeah the world has changed  yeah  and Spotify is really fucking it up  for these artists  well it's not about album sales anymore  it's about getting popular  and getting rants out on the road  and fucking touring  making money that way  she's not one of those  she's got a family  eh well sorry  this is her experience 
[02:47:30]  yeah  you know  she's got a family in New York City  she goes  you know how we make money  she was featured on Louis' show last night  yeah  and they do tour to like Mexico  and other places  they've been to like Paris  and a few other joints  and they're a wedding band  oh yeah  they're a wedding band  she goes  that's how we make our money  we go out every weekend  as a wedding band  and they're way  no offense to wedding bands  shit  you can't say anything on the show  look I already stopped myself  no offense to wedding bands  but they are  they are  in a different 
[02:48:00]  they're  oh yeah  they're on a different  I'll just say trip  than the average wedding band  yeah  they're very original  with their shit  so I thought  I thought it was fascinating  because I thought  I was excited for it  I'm like  hey man  this will lead to some downloads for you  some nice pocket money  she goes  not at all  people just do not download  you know  music anymore  certainly they're not really paying for it  or if they are  it's like  nothing  yeah  you gotta go on the road  and you gotta get endorsements  right  that's it  that's what it's all about  so  it's a whole nother 
[02:48:30]  ball game  get some fancy stickers  and shirts  stickers  shirts  you fucking shit  your god damn tour  right  get on the road  right  on the road again  oh boy  na na na na  and the laptop goes  oh  you just called it  that's it  good for you  I like the little Nelson  that's too bad  maybe next time  yeah  maybe next time  ah that's a shame  that's a bit of a shame  what are you gonna do 
[02:49:00]  oh he's tired  well  he's 81  Jesus  we're all tired  exactly  but he's 81 tired  that's a different type  of time  81 tired  81 tired  you can bitch  and I certainly do enough of it  I can bitch about being tired  but 81 tired  is a whole nother  different time  that's like waiting till  you wait till noon  until you can feel your feet  or something  you know  it just takes forever  that must be like  the worst case you've ever had  of when you're driving 
[02:49:30]  and you're falling asleep  at the wheel  sure  but just being like that  all the time  81 tired  I think you might get  two good hours a day  where you're like  you know what  I feel pretty good  I'm feeling pretty  yeah  full of vim and vigor  and then it slowly goes downhill  the rest of the day  yeah  I'm feeling good for a second  alright what do we got  to wrap up here  I have to plug  Jimmy  Florida  I'm back on the road now  Florida  West Palm Beach  July 10th through 12th
