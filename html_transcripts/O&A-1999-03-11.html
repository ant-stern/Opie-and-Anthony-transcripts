<pre> The Rock of New York 1027 WNEW, Metetica. Turn the page.  From Karajic, it's Opi, it's Anthony, it's Ralph Dutour in the studio still.  Wait, do you have your mic on? Oh, you went to that one on me?  There you go. So we brought Ralph in because you guys got  to see Johnny Lang last night. Yeah, yeah, pretty cool.  How was it? We need the review. Well, first of all, I just can't stand him.  He's jealous. The guy, he's young, he's a good looking kid, the chicks love him, 
[00:30]
 he can play like a mother. Yeah, he can.  You know, you really didn't get that from when he plays live in the studio with us  when he comes in. How really good he plays guitar.  The guys just kickin' ass. And the voice.  That's the scary part. It's all going to get better.  Just annoyed me. A really good, great show.  You know, I was watching a real stripped down band. 
[01:00]
 It's just two guitars, bass, drum, keyboard.  And I kept thinking, where are the background singers?  Where's the horn section? You know, they're all there.  Next time you can totally hear him going that way.  You know, get the tower power horn section behind him.  And the voice is great. My God.  The voice is amazing. Where did that come from?  18 years old and he sounds like Joe Cocker with his prime.  There's some black guy down south going, hey, what happened to my voice?  Wait a minute. Exactly.  You know, and when he's in the studio and he's talking with us, doing an interview and stuff, 
[01:30]
 he's, yeah, hey, you know, wow, that's cool.  And then from the stage, even in between songs, he's just, how we doing, people?  Like, whoa, the hell happened. It's amazing.  Right on. Great show.  And there was a mixed crowd, right? A lot of teeny boppers, but then a lot of older people.  No, not at all. It was mostly older folks.  I don't think there was, I didn't see that many.  It ran, well, the kids were up front.  Yeah, they were all up front. I saw some little girlies and they're jumping around.  Throwing flowers and notes at him and stuff.  Yeah.  And then in the crowd, I'm looking, I see biker dudes and then the guy in the suit, 
[02:00]
 that man, women. It was everybody.  Yeah. That proves he's the real thing right there.  Oh yeah. And people were impressed and rightfully so.  Like I said, the guy can play.  Ralph, were you singing backup before Johnny running last night?  What happened?  Smoking used to smoke.  Yeah.  A lot of smoking happened last night.  Yeah.  People just, you know, I smelt some weed too.  Some stink.  Wafting around.  Little skunk.  Little skunky.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:30]
 You get a contact buzz last night?  No, I couldn't tell. I was drinking beer and Jack.  I got a contact buzz at the Black Crows.  Did you?  Oh, there was so much pot in there. You couldn't help but leave hot.  Yeah. And I got the Ulmer brothers tonight.  So, oh boy.  Yeah. So that's a real straight crowd.  Look at you.  Look at you, Mr. Party Guy.  Yeah.  Yeah. I'll be deaf tomorrow on the radio.  Right.  I thought today was bad, folks. Wait.  I thought you sounded great, man. The lunch hour was great today.  I always had a lot of fun with that.  That's a very good feature. You get to hear so many songs 
[03:00]
 that you usually don't hear on the radio.  You put on Missing Persons today.  Walking in LA. Hey, somebody wanted to hear it.  I'll be honest. I was at home when you, you know,  put the phone call on the air and I cranked up my stereo.  I'm like, what the hell? I'll listen to this.  Reminds me of that little suit she used to wear.  Remember that video?  Dale Bozier.  Yeah. You just don't want to see her wearing that suit these days.  Oh, I know. I saw her in the VH1.  Did you see the behind the scenes?  And she's in the little minivan driving it.  She's got a good attitude, though. She's got a good attitude.  Yeah. I'd rather have it with a good ass than a good attitude. 
[03:30]
 A lot nicer to look at.  We'll feed you lies.  You guys are going to have a great show, by the way.  Oh, now you're just jinkstead.  No, no. People don't know. People don't know.  Every day, Anthony comes in and starts playing around with his computer  and he scribbles stuff and then he grabs the paper.  All right.  Goes to make the shot and he misses every day.  I can't hit the garbage pail with rolled up paper.  I don't know what it is.  And it's not even that far away.  But the one day you did hit, show was abysmal.  Show was terrible. 
[04:00]
 So what did you miss?  So did you miss?  I missed.  Oh, you missed.  So by a mile.  He misses 99% of the time. He misses.  All right. We'll have a great show then today.  Yeah, exactly.  I got to remember that now.  All right. Cool. We got lots to get to today.  Kenny Wayne Shepard on the way and Hendrix next.  And the phone's already ringing.  If you want to send a fax, that's cool.  212-957-WNEW.  The Rock of New York 1027-WNEW.  Kenny Wayne Shepard, Blue on Black and Hendrix too.  It's Opie and Anthony and Ralph DeTore.  I guess Ralph's going to be the third wheel today, man.  Sitting in, Ralph? 
[04:30]
 You going to sit in for a little while?  If you so desire.  Well, that's kind of what we like to do here on our show.  It's kind of just like a hangout.  It's a party atmosphere.  Absolutely.  You know, we'll invite anyone in the studio  if they got something to say and answer the show.  That wasn't the way a few months ago.  There was a list of some sort, wasn't there?  Well, right now, let's see.  We're talking a list.  Yeah, there's Ralph.  Matt.  That's about it.  That's pretty much it.  Now, Jane.  Yeah. 
[05:00]
 There's Lisa.  Black girl, Ben the Fag.  We haven't seen Lisa in a while, though.  Yeah, we've done a lot of Lisa.  But Andrea, she's on the list, right?  No, I mean, Andrea doesn't do on-air stuff, though.  We're talking to people that would contribute to the show.  Turn on a mic and just go with us.  Gotcha.  Andrea doesn't like being on mic.  We understand that.  All right, Daily News.  I'll be back.  Joe Tory.  It's looking better and better for Joe, huh?  I don't know.  I can't get any information.  They're saying they caught the cancer early, 
[05:30]
 which is very, very important when you get the prostate cancer.  What's wrong, Steddy?  He's the best manager in baseball.  George was losing it last night on TV.  He's cracking a little bit.  He has every right to.  He's had a rough couple of weeks.  A couple of weeks?  He's had a rough couple of years.  I don't like seeing the emotional George Steinbrenner.  I'm sorry. 
[06:00]
 I want the scum, the bad guy, you know?  The one that would yell at Billy Martin.  Remember the fights they used to have?  You never saw him like,  Billy, I'm sorry.  Would you come back?  I can't!  No, it was always, you know, he was the bad guy.  He's mellowed with age.  I don't like seeing that.  Oh, he's on TV.  Every time I see him on TV, now he's crying.  He has a lot to cry about lately.  I don't want to see it.  He had to cry over Joe Tory. 
[06:30]
 He had to cry over Joe DiMaggio.  The World Series.  He had to cry over the World Series.  He's getting the trophy.  He's getting this trophy from you.  He's getting the best mom in the world.  Well, when we had Coney on a few months back,  he admitted to us on our show that George was hammered.  He was a little lit.  Yeah, yeah, that's for sure.  So you got to give him that one.  But now you see him all the time. 
[07:00]
 We didn't like trading the bowler, but the Rockets the best pitcher in baseball.  Anthony, what are you saying?  He's always lit?  No, I'm saying he's always emotional.  He's very emotional.  So he's crying now.  George, come on.  Get tough, right?  Snap out of it.  Yeah, toughen up.  But, Tory, it's looking like he's going to be all right.  They're all knocking on wood.  But the whole thing with prostate cancer, if you catch it early,  you've got a good chance of surviving and living a normal life.  Ow.  But I get heebie-jeebies. 
[07:30]
 It's something we're all going to have to face.  A very sensitive subject.  Don't they say if you have a lot of sex that your odds of getting it go down?  Oh, really?  I think I heard that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then I'm in trouble.  Less blockage.  See, I thought I was going to go the other way.  No, I'm in trouble.  But I mean, my dad, he goes to the Legion every week.  Yeah.  All the guys there have it.  Really?  Every single one of them.  Really?  Yeah, in different stages. 
[08:00]
 And my dad's got the priest stuff happening.  So far he's OK, but they've caught it early in him.  No, they do.  This is more popular than you guys think, this prostate.  Oh, it is.  Popular.  I just doubt it.  It's more common.  Yeah.  Popular.  Popular.  Wow.  Wrong word.  I know.  Everyone wants it.  It's 85.  You could dance to it.  It's pretty popular.  Wow.  Well, you know, we obviously hope for the best.  Absolutely.  You've got to send them just nothing but good wishes.  And of course, 80% of early diagnosis get cured. 
[08:30]
 There you go.  That's what they say.  A little later in the show, we got to talk about the other famous people that  have had a bout with prostate cancer.  I saw that.  There's a couple of big names in there.  Marv Levy from the Bills, Stan Musial, Michael Milken, Norman Schwarzkopf,  Harry Belafonte, Louis Farrakhan, Jesse Helms, Mayor Marion Barre. 
[09:00]
 It sure doesn't discriminate as far as political beliefs.  No.  Jesse Helms and Farrakhan.  Yeah.  I didn't think they had anything in common.  Bob Dole, believe it or not.  Bob Dole.  Arnold Palmer, Jerry Lewis.  Hey, lady.  And our favorite, Tarleton Heston.  He was on Larry K. talking about his prostate cancer.  Yes, yes.  So maybe we'll get a visit from Chuck Heston later.  Chuck Heston a little later, right? 
[09:30]
 For the show.  Hey, Jeff, we got you on the air.  What's up, man?  Hey, open up.  Yeah.  How you doing?  All right.  I got a question for management on your behalf.  Okay.  Well,  Ixnay on the e-fray ear pay.  Now I heard that they canceled Free Beer Thursday. 
[10:00]
 Right.  Now we predicted last week that it would only last two weeks,  but it lasted one week.  One week.  One week.  Come on, guys.  One week.  It's been canceled.  Come on, management.  Let them have something to drink.  If you're just tuning in, and you didn't hear us talking about this last week,  we had a big, huge management meeting.  The entire staff of N.E.W. is there.  And I almost stayed awake during the whole thing.  I was very proud of myself, almost.  And we're trying to figure out how to get more people to listen to N.E.W. 
[10:30]
 and really, you know, embrace our audience and stuff.  Pump up the station, a little more visibility.  Pump up the stations.  Maybe start marketing it a little bit.  Sure. Let people know that there's something going on here at N.E.W.  And one of our bosses stood up at the end of the meeting and announced that for now on,  on Thursdays, it's going to be Free Beer Thursday.  Right.  Where they're going to order beer at four o'clock,  and the entire staff is allowed to get drunk.  As an open exchange of ideas, a little forum for everybody to loosen up and exchange ideas. 
[11:00]
 Can you imagine if your boss suggested Free Beer Thursday?  Got to rub it.  And it's 10 to 4. It's almost time.  Well, I don't think it's happening today.  I heard it was canceled.  Yeah.  Jeff?  It's canceled.  Did he go?  Are we going to have problems with the phones again today?  I think it's somewhat visionary, actually.  Visionary.  The whole concept.  It's visionary.  Dressed down Friday took so long to be embraced by corporate America.  Right, right. By true corporations.  Yes.  Yes. 
[11:30]
 We're on the edge, babe.  Well, Free Beer Thursday, I believe, has been canceled,  but this week we did start a new tradition, Tequila Tuesday with Sammy Hagar.  I thought that was going to be in conjunction with Free Beer Thursday, but I guess not.  No.  Crack Friday I'm waiting for.  Yeah.  But we just like start up the crack pipes.  We just boot up.  Oh, yeah.  So it was, you know, I mean, I love beer. Anthony loves beer. Ralph loves beer.  But it was just kind of a silly idea.  Yeah, that's what we thought.  Really trying to get more people listen to our show and the rest of the station. 
[12:00]
 I don't know if a concept called Free Beer Thursday is going to help that along.  No, no.  You know, I'll have as many beers as I want after we get off the air.  We take it pretty damn serious when we're in here.  Yeah, yeah.  Trying to make people laugh and forget about their miserable days.  You know?  Well, you don't have to join in.  I mean, why ruin it for the rest of the staff, guys?  We do.  We can still partake in Free Beer Thursday.  You just, you.  Well, I think it might interfere with some people's old job.  I think it might actually help them do it better. 
[12:30]
 Really?  Well, it's hard enough.  Some people it's hard enough to get people to work around here.  You think after a few beers, they're going to want to work?  I think everybody was pretty damn hard around here, actually.  Then again, maybe I'm in the wrong office.  Always the diplomat.  Yeah. Ralph doesn't like telling it like it is.  He has this little nice persona they want everyone to know about.  He's folding his arms.  This is where he starts getting defensive now.  No, not at all.  We love most of the people we work with. 
[13:00]
 Of course.  They know that.  I'm going to go out there lobby for Free Beer Thursday.  All right, cool.  Let's try and bring it back.  Now, what's going on with seven minutes?  What's going on with this kid that needs a haircut?  I'll get a haircut and go to school.  This school is right next to where I live, actually.  All right.  Well, explain the story real fast, Ralph.  The story is the kid has long hair and it's a private school.  He's only five and he has an earring, too.  And they want him to cut his hair.  Saying that they're a private school, they can enforce any rules they want. 
[13:30]
 It's not discrimination.  It's tough nuggies.  He can go to public school and fight it, you know,  but I think if he wants to get in this private school,  he has to adhere to those rules.  I think it's a silly rule, but it's the school's prerogative, right?  It is.  Well, what is getting a haircut going to...  Well, I don't see why long hair is going to get in the way of his education.  I don't understand that at all.  Right.  It's going to get in his eyes.  He won't see the chalkboard.  Why?  Because if you don't let him get a haircut...  I'll play the devil's advocate here because I truly don't give a crap. 
[14:00]
 If he doesn't get a haircut and they have to let him in,  what about the kid with the mohawk and the bone through the nose  and whatever else, what other kind of look any kid wants in school?  Let them all in.  I don't care.  We're in the middle of the world.  It's distracting to the educational process, Opie.  You can't teach kids when they're distracted by a student with a mohawk  or a bone through their nose.  All right.  So they want the kid with the long hair to cut his hair.  Right.  Basically.  Basically.  Because it's a distraction to other students and stuff. 
[14:30]
 Perhaps his haircut wouldn't be, but if they allow his,  they have to allow the other one in the next step,  and that might be that much worse.  So they want to nip it in the bud.  So why don't they just kick out all the ugly kids from private school?  Because they're a distraction to an education.  You can't make them go out and get corrective surgery.  That's a public school.  Now, there's only a private, even the Civil Liberties Union  is saying that the private school, quote,  has the right to make decisions in terms of dress and grooming.  All right.  Then they should kick out all the ugly kids as well,  because it's the same thing. 
[15:00]
 It's a distraction to learning.  But they can't have corrective surgery.  I understand about distractions in school, Opie.  I went to that, where was that, Fifth Avenue Elementary School  down there in East Northport on the island.  My God, when I was going there, they had this program  where they were letting mentally retarded children in  with the normal students.  Let us call them normal.  Quote.  Yeah, because I was included in the normal class.  I probably shouldn't have been.  I was going to say, there goes that theory.  Yeah. 
[15:30]
 And I forgot what kind of crazy liberal terminology they gave it.  It was some kind of thing where they let the retarded children in  with the normal kids, thinking that they will each benefit  from the same as, well, it scared the bejesus out of me.  And I could not.  There was one kid, he had water on the brain or something.  His head was like a watermelon.  He had a head three times bigger than anyone's head.  And it was distracting to me at that age to do my English and math, 
[16:00]
 looking at a giant head, because that's all I could see was a big head.  Like the second I take my eyes off of his big head to do my work,  I'd be thinking, I've got to look at that head again.  And I'll be so before I know it, pencils down.  I'm like, I spent a half hour looking at the giant head  and I got nothing done and I failed.  No wonder you didn't do well at school.  Yes.  Too busy looking at the big head.  It was the giant head kid and then there was another kid with his pupil.  His pupil was like a cat's. 
[16:30]
 They were oblong like that.  So you just gaze and go, look at that eye.  Time, class over.  I was looking at the big head in the eye, kids.  Son of a gun.  So it gets distracting.  But the hair thing, it wouldn't bother me.  But it's a private school and they could do what they want.  As long as they don't let big head kids go to school.  Well, keep them in the big head kid school.  Do they have the big head kid school?  I don't know.  I think medical testing has gotten much better  and I think they weeded those genes out of people. 
[17:00]
 Tell you the truth.  You think?  I don't think there's as much of that going on as there used to be.  You know, you can go to the schools and see the big head kid  and the wacky eye kid.  They do testing early in the pregnancy and go, you know,  you're going to have to eject that kid.  Whoa.  And that they do.  For God's sake, they do.  Eject?  Well, not for God's sake.  No, they, I don't know how they say it, but they say, look, you know, 
[17:30]
 they do tests for things like spina bifida.  And then all of a sudden it's like, hey, you know, you got this.  What do you want to do?  They go, okay, you know.  Look, Ralph just took his headphones off.  He's walking out of the studio.  Well, what?  Can't, isn't this our forum for honesty?  Yes, it is.  This is what happens.  Why can we not speak of it?  I'm going out and saying that I don't think there's as many  retarded kids and as many children with physical deformities 
[18:00]
 because of medical science and the testing that they do.  And if these things pop up that the option to abort is there  and people use it.  And it wasn't 20 years ago.  Of course it was, but the testing wasn't there.  So all of a sudden, you know, you're in the delivery room  and it's like, whoa, gee, Doc, if you could have told me  this a few months prior, we could have done something about it.  But you know, now I got two headed Chang. 
[18:30]
 Oh, man, that's harsh.  Yes, but true.  Okay.  I'll give it to you.  Sorry.  More political incorrectness on the way.  One oh two seven W.  Any W.  The Rock of New York.  Pink Floyd have a cigar.  Should we make some wacky Monica joke here or.  We're lacking one.  They've all been told by the farce.  So.  And. 
[19:00]
 All right.  All right, man.  So be an Anthony.  Hey, and you're right over there.  Now I got this all figured out.  All right.  I got this all figured out.  We got a fact.  Now I hope you rage as as hard on the air as you just did off the air.  Well, now I'm seeing into it a little more than I was.  So please don't hold back.  Now, don't hold back.  I can dump out if you do use a curse.  Just let it fly.  First, let me preface this now.  OK.  I see where this fax came from.  I thought it was somebody faxing us saying, hey, look at what somebody wrote in the new 
[19:30]
 issue of stepping out.  Right.  But then I look, it's fax from stepping out.  So this guy, a loser, obviously wrote this to try to get us aggravated.  So we would talk about him.  Do you see that?  I see that now.  So it came from stepping out.  But we'll read it anyway.  I know your intentions.  This is the issue with Reverend Al Sharpton on the cover.  Yeah, it seems this guy, Dan Lorenzo, does this little 24-7 column. 
[20:00]
 We'll give him a little plug.  God knows he probably needs it.  Did you see the lame cover we had two weeks ago?  Now, this guy works for stepping out.  Yes.  And he does this little column and he's saying that we had a lame cover two weeks ago.  Yes.  Opie and Anthony from any W.  I told Chauncey Chauncey runs that magazine.  Not to put them on the cover.  Nobody I knew, no one I know had ever heard of them.  That's an all out lie. 
[20:30]
 Well, first of all, when Chauncey did the interview when we first got here.  Well, yeah, for God's sake.  And they look like my neighbor's landscapers.  Check, please.  I tried to listen to their show, but couldn't deal with it after about five minutes.  We've got a lot of lame radio for the market that's supposedly the hippest in the world.  And then he goes on to these like radio shows that no one ever listens to and stuff because  he's so too cool for the room. 
[21:00]
 Dan, you write a column for stepping out magazine  and you're making fun of us.  It's it's it's a rag.  Yeah.  You write a little piece of crap column in a rag that no one even knows how to get.  I wouldn't know how to get that magazine if it wasn't sent to us.  I don't put them on the cover.  A lot of pull over there at us stepping out.  We were on it anyway. 
[21:30]
 Boy, yeah.  Talking about his interviews with Dan.  Dan, your little cute little column next to the ad for boobs.  Wait, no one reads this.  The only time anyone reads it is when you put someone on the cover and they say,  hey, I was on the cover of stepping out.  And they gave me some free copies and and check it out.  But he had some problem with us being on the cover.  Well, we had a problem with being on the cover because those were the worst pictures ever 
[22:00]
 taken of us.  Yeah, obviously.  I think stepping out had an agenda.  Yeah, because then he goes on to say, you know, K-Rock is really cool.  Even after Howard goes off the air and Howard Stern in the morning,  a one share all day long.  So he's obviously kissing their ass.  It's in their best interest to be in bed with them over there, which is fine. 
[22:30]
 John's he's been on his show for a few years.  So I guess, you know, put us on the cover and make fun of us and stuff.  That's cool.  But Dan, you know, when you drive a piece of crap car, don't toot your horn.  OK, you know, he's making fun of no one ever heard of us.  No one ever heard of you and your magazine.  We gave him more publicity than anyone else in the last year or so.  Yeah, Reverend Al is going to be talking about it. 
[23:00]
 I don't think so.  And in all honesty, Anthony and I have been interviewed many times the last four or five  years.  By far, because the show is all about honesty, by far the worst interview that has ever been  written about us.  Well, he did it when we first got here, Danny W.  And it was supposed to come out right about then because we were new to the market.  Hey, it's we're new.  Check this out.  Six months later, this thing turns up and he didn't even call up to ask new questions. 
[23:30]
 We're commenting about people that aren't here anymore, about the state of the station.  And it's still in a it was still in an osmosis transitional phase, you know,  and he didn't even call up to get any updates.  And then Dan, Dan, with his little column talks about how no one heard about us.  Shut up with your stupid little paper rag and yet your little column.  The article was about 70 to 75 percent right. 
[24:00]
 It's like a high school newspaper he's writing for.  He's all full of piss and vinegar.  Yeah, shut up, Dan.  Dan, what do you think?  You're going to go, oh, yeah, well, it's it's got stepping out magazine and then and then  Times, the Time magazine, right?  And then we know you're listening right now.  You could act like you don't listen to us, but it's so obvious that you listen to us  every single day.  He faxed it over.  Yeah, he bashed us and then faxes it to us. 
[24:30]
 Are you an idiot?  Well, he obviously wanted us to talk about it.  Of course.  Here you go, Dan.  We talked about your loser little career there.  All right.  Good job.  Boy, really, really doing well in your journalism career.  Huh?  I bet that's good.  You send a lot of copies over to your parents' house.  Oh, wait, you live there.  That's right.  So you're probably.  Yeah, they see all your work.  No, that's good.  That's good. 
[25:00]
 All right.  Anthony MapQuest dot com.  This is a great, great thing, Opie.  You're on the computer.  You go to MapQuest dot com and you can get driving directions to anywhere in the country.  They print out a nice map.  You can print out a map from MapQuest to anywhere in the country.  It's great if you get lost a lot.  It's really easy, too, because what you do is you put the address of where you are,  put the address of where you want to go.  Yes.  And then a whole map gets printed out and also the directions in detail telling you 
[25:30]
 like how many miles you have to be on each road and stuff.  Yeah.  Let's say you're, um, you're, uh, douchebag Dan Lorenzo, right, from Stepping Out magazine.  And you just got this hot job that's much better than the rag Stepping Out.  You're writing obituaries for the Fargo Times.  Right.  So you have to know how to get from New York to Fargo.  Sure.  Well, douchebag Dan should go to MapQuest and then you pop in where you're going  and where you're coming from.  And it prints out a little map. 
[26:00]
 You can print out a map with directions, step by step directions, every road,  how many miles you're supposed to be on that road all the way to your destination.  Exactly.  Wonderful.  Now I went online the other day and I, uh, I put in the, uh, the address of where we work  in my home address.  They gave me the exact route we do.  It's scary.  Every day.  Try it.  Try it up.  Up map quest.com.  Put in where you work and then put in your house.  The rock of New York, one Oh two seven W any W the latest from collective soul off their 
[26:30]
 CD dosage.  That's heavy.  Tomorrow the winning begins and continues all weekend.  We got collective soul tickets to give away.  And in the near future, we got the band coming up to say hi to us.  Yes.  So that's going to be very cool.  It's open Anthony.  Hello.  Taking a lot of hits today.  A lot of people trying to abuse us and that's okay.  That's all right.  Take your shots.  We don't care.  Yeah.  We know we have people that like what we do.  That's funny.  I got a bunch of emails from people on that Dan Lorenzo thing. 
[27:00]
 Yeah.  It turns out he was okay.  He was in this like half-assed hair band, metal band that just kind of flopped.  So he's a bitter musician.  Oh, I see.  That now it, now it all makes complete sense.  It does make sense because you were in a band and you know how that goes.  The bitter, the bitter musician.  Yeah.  That hates the world because the world didn't discover his talents.  Yeah, man.  I've seen a million of these guys.  Oh brother.  Now he's on his, he's a little paper roof. 
[27:30]
 Yeah.  Dan trying to act like we're not cool enough for stepping out magazine.  Yeah.  Sorry, Dan.  Yeah.  I guess we're not cool enough to have articles written about us in the daily news,  the New York Times, the LA Times.  I could go on forever.  I don't see VH1 going to your door for a what happened to.  Should be for a never happened to.  Now speaking of which, there's something very interesting going on with our show.  And it's kind of frustrating to Anthony and I. 
[28:00]
 We're finding out every day.  You guys send us email and we read every single piece of email by the way.  And I know a lot of people get bummed because we don't write you back.  It's almost impossible at this point, but we're trying to write everyone back.  But don't think that your email is just going into a waste basket.  We read every single piece.  The good stuff, the bad stuff, the stupid junk mail you sent us,  the pictures we've seen a million times.  We read it all and we want you to know that.  Okay.  So keep your feedback coming because it definitely helps us build the show. 
[28:30]
 But the one thing we notice every day when we're reading email,  people go, hey man, I started listening to you two weeks ago.  Hey man, I started last Friday when you had blah, blah.  One person said they tuned in for the first time when we had Sammy Hagar on Tuesday.  Wow.  And says, I'm hooked.  I'm hooked.  I'll be listening every day.  So the thing I need for all the faithful listeners to do  that are listening to our voice right now, please send us another email.  Okay.  Especially if you have an email less than a while and tell us exactly when you start 
[29:00]
 listening to us because we want to take a little survey for the show.  I'm very interested.  It'll also help us because there's a lot of old bits we'd like to keep playing.  We want to make sure there's enough people out there that haven't heard them.  You know what I mean?  And if the email comes in, well, I've only been listening for two months.  That's really going to help us.  But if you've been there from the beginning, we want to know that as well.  So if you could take a little time, the email addresses opac, opack at w, n, w dot com.  You can get to that through the w, n, w website as well. 
[29:30]
 Just tell us a little bit about yourself, your name, where you live,  I guess your age would be very cool.  And basically when you started listening to us.  Yeah.  Well, when you stop listening to us, because there's few people that stop  listening because of us as well.  We want to just take a quick survey for the show and that would help us greatly.  Okay.  Cool.  All right.  Very cool.  Well, there's another big story in town here.  This Amy Watkins.  Oh, yeah.  This is a very, very tragic story.  Very tragic. 
[30:00]
 Amy Watkins was murdered in Brooklyn.  She had what?  Like a 10 inch knife.  Oh, yeah.  Stuck in her back.  In her back while she was walking home.  Now I got some theories.  They're out there.  They're out there, but it's just a hunch.  These are your, your theories based on what?  Opie.  Are you basing these theories on anything factual?  Just what I've seen on TV.  I'm no detective by any means.  And your gut feeling.  My gut feeling.  I'm not a gut feeling.  Right.  Sometimes you just gotta as a detective, go with your gut feeling. 
[30:30]
 That's right.  Mr. Clobo.  Yes, of course.  Yes.  Let me hear what you think happened.  Okay.  Now, I'm not accusing anyone because I know the email will come in.  But Amy Watkins.  Martin Landau.  Amy Watkins.  Do you think it's Martin Landau?  No, I don't think so.  Or Jack Cassidy.  Could be Jack Cassidy.  It was always Jack Cassidy.  Amy Watkins, a grad student.  She just did a lot for the needy.  She was a volunteer. 
[31:00]
 She was at the time of her death, what?  Helping women that were battered in relationships and stuff.  Yes.  Volunteered a lot of her free time to help others.  Okay.  In Brooklyn.  Now, every day she would leave this place she was working at or volunteering at.  This is what I got from the news.  And she'd walk home with her boyfriend.  Okay?  Yeah.  The one day she doesn't walk home with her boyfriend,  she is stabbed in the back with a 10 inch knife.  Right.  That is plastic around the handle of the knife. 
[31:30]
 Plastic.  Which pretty much tells me maybe a little premeditated happening here.  Maybe.  I'm not a detective.  This is my gut feeling.  So what you're saying is people trying to keep fingerprints from the knife handle.  Of course.  All right.  I believe if it was just a pure robbery,  they wouldn't have worried about fingerprints on a knife.  They would have taken the knife with them.  But someone wanted to make sure they didn't get caught.  Okay.  Now they're interviewing everyone on TV the last two days.  This is where it's my hunch. 
[32:00]
 I'm not accusing anyone.  They interview the boyfriend at his job the next day.  He is working and getting his feelings on the death of his girlfriend.  Working.  Working.  Who in their right mind would go to work the day after your loved one was murdered?  Interesting.  Even if the president of the United States, God forbid, lost someone close to him,  he's not going to work the next day. 
[32:30]
 Hell no.  This guy was in the middle of doing his job.  It was some weird thing with a ship.  He was sanding some kind of hull or something.  I didn't really get what his job was.  He's working.  And he's working and they're interviewing him about the death of his girlfriend.  That's kind of weird, huh?  That's where I point my finger.  I'm not accusing.  It's a hunch.  Very interesting.  Reminds me of a case.  I remember when Robert Culp once killed Mary Ann Mobley. 
[33:00]
 And I went over and he was indeed working.  And you know how that turned out?  He was guilty.  Yeah, there you go.  I had it figured out from the start, just like you.  All right.  Fascinating.  You're saying it's the boyfriend.  It's just a hunch.  Not accusing.  Don't feel like getting sued.  I'm just saying that's your gut feeling.  My gut feeling.  Based on nothing but what you have said here.  Every day she walks home with a boyfriend.  The one day they don't walk home together, it happens. 
[33:30]
 Could just be a tragic little twist.  It could be a coincidence, obviously.  All right.  We'll see how this plays out.  Dude, no one goes to work after someone really close to them is murdered.  That's kind of bad, yeah.  And four months into their little relationship?  That's when you're like so in love.  Ooh, yeah.  So they're in good.  I know I'm going to catch hell for that, but maybe, maybe not.  That's my gut feeling.  All right.  Yeah, that doesn't sound like a common MO for any of the robberies. 
[34:00]
 Around the city.  Well, taking a huge knife and putting it through somebody and then taking their.  Well, plus that that particular area of Brooklyn,  they're saying the crime rate has drastically dropped over the years.  Yeah.  So it's not a crime rate in neighborhood by any means anymore.  They had their problems like everywhere else, but it's.  They pretty much cleaned up the area.  Wonder why the paper didn't print anything like, you know,  the boyfriend is being looked at or the boyfriend isn't being looked at. 
[34:30]
 I don't know.  It just.  Sometimes the cops hold that stuff.  Yeah.  It was just very, very suspicious when I was watching all the.  You know, news reports on it and I see the boyfriend was working at a ginsu factory.  Is that true?  No.  Oh, that's false.  OK, that's false.  All right.  We just saw that.  I wasn't.  I wasn't sure.  What did Jackie the Jokeman hand you a fax or something?  A piece of paper, Anthony?  Sounds like a bad joke you'd hear over that.  All right. 
[35:00]
 Mike Levy writes, what if the guy that killed Amy is not white?  Will the Reverend Al Sharpton be outraged and vocal?  No way you won't hear squat from that S head.  Oh, interesting.  Yeah.  We'll see if he pipes up.  If it turns out it's a black guy.  Who knows?  One oh two seven W.N.E.W.  The Rock of New York, Goo Goo Dolls and Dizzy from Dizzy Up The Girl.  It's so be it's Anthony and in the studio, Earl, our buddy, our pal Earl.  Hey, we love Earl and he's very knowledgeable. 
[35:30]
 He knows sports.  And he just saw some music.  He just ran in here to tell us about a trade the Nets just pulled.  Yes, the Nets have Stefan Marbury.  It's still unofficial, but it's pretty much going to happen.  That's amazing.  That's a great pickup.  Now, what does it mean for the team?  Well, it means nothing this year, Mad Dog, because the team blows.  They got to get Jason Williams healthy.  Jason Williams, you know, I love the guy.  He has the biggest heart in the NBA, but he's got to get the operation. 
[36:00]
 On his hand or his finger or his thumb, whatever the hell it is.  Everything's hurt.  Yeah.  I understand he wants to be out there, you know, and be a leader for the team.  But he's just got to give up on the season, get healthy and we'll start again next year.  Yeah, especially since they're going to make the playoffs.  No, and this season just is a waste.  It's a wash.  It's a waste as I watch every single game.  Ah, disappointment.  Now, I honestly I'm not watching as much and that's the truth.  Well, good. 
[36:30]
 I said I would boycott the whole season.  It's kind of hard.  Rays are down, especially being in New York.  The Knicks, very frustrating to watch.  Patrick Ewing, the Choke Meister.  It's over.  It's over.  I just can't watch him anymore.  He can negate a great game with one last shot.  Huh?  He's missed a few now this year, hasn't he?  I think at least three or four.  Yeah, I just hate watching him play.  And I'm still frustrated.  They traded Oakley and and Starks. 
[37:00]
 I'd rather see those guys out there every day diving for loose balls and having a heart.  Everyone gets traded.  It's part of the game.  So who did the Nets give up for Marbury?  Gatling and no one big.  They didn't give up anybody.  Well, now they have to re-sign Marbury is the problem, right?  Because he's a free agent after this year.  Yes, it's going to be a big problem.  Well, they can start now, though, which is cool. 
[37:30]
 Is anything going on with the NCAA today?  There's been a couple of upsets.  Syracuse is out.  Yeah, I heard about that.  Minnesota is out.  That doesn't matter.  Duke's going to win at all.  I like Kentucky.  Can I say right now, write it on?  Well, that's an obvious choice, though.  I don't think anyone's beaten Duke this year.  How far you think St. John's is going to go?  At least sweet 16.  Yeah, I think so, too. 
[38:00]
 And Connecticut still looks good, but I don't know.  I just don't see anyone beating Duke.  Little sports break for the boys.  Wow, I'm out of this one.  College B-ball, huh?  Well, now you know how I feel when you start talking about cartoons.  I mean, I love cartoons, but the stuff you remember about cartoons,  I'm like, well, I'll just watch Anthony.  I don't know much about college basketball.  Wow.  Well, what's cool is college basketball the next two weeks.  It's just really exciting, the NCAA tournament.  All right.  We could blow off the NBA season for a while and then get back into the season 
[38:30]
 when it starts getting interesting, I guess.  How does this affect me in half life?  As long as it doesn't affect you at all.  If I was over your house, you would hate me.  No, I'd be on the computer and you'd be watching the TV.  Well, then your wife Jennifer would.  Oh, yeah.  She'd have a problem with that.  Yes, because I try to get Anthony into basketball.  Wasn't working.  It almost worked.  Well, I was appreciating their talent.  A few years back, it was the Bulls and the Knicks in the playoffs. 
[39:00]
 And I was explaining the game to Ann, like really getting into it.  And by the end of the game, it was real close.  Anthony is like jumping off the couch with me and stuff.  And really getting into it.  I was just kind of like, ah, look at that idiot.  Right.  Oh, God.  You got to admit, you were kind of getting into it  because I explained it in a way that made it a little more exciting.  And your wife Jennifer was giving you a look like,  Anthony, don't you dare get into basketball.  Well, also, I must say it was the last like 10 seconds of the game that lasted an hour  that was exciting.  Well, that's always the case.  I just, you know, occasionally have my problems with basketball. 
[39:30]
 I don't find it all that exciting.  Sorry.  It's just me.  All right.  You're hoping now, on the other hand, huge basketball fan.  Do you watch any sports?  Yeah.  Like what?  I like watching football.  Yeah.  It's always fun.  Baseball occasionally.  You get into your Yanks.  Of course.  You know, officially, and we explained this last year, I'm a huge Mets fan.  Anthony's a pretty big Yanks fan.  Yeah.  But when the Yankees were in the series, I definitely rooted for them, which I don't 
[40:00]
 know, a lot of Mets fans, I assume, do that.  Yeah.  What does Nick have a problem with our show?  Everyone's PMSing today, I think.  Yeah.  Some of them.  Hi, NW.  Hey, you guys are off the itinerary.  What's going on?  What do you mean itinerary?  The one that your program manager wrote of.  I'm trying to follow his damn circle.  And you guys are like, oh, what's going on?  Well, what haven't we talked about today that we're supposed to, according to the boss?  Sports?  Yeah, sports wasn't on the Opie and Anthony format clock that our program director drew up. 
[40:30]
 I see.  Well, you guys make a drive home a lot enjoyable.  Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.  No problem.  Bye.  We could talk about the stock market.  Up today.  Again?  Yeah, closing on 10,000.  Is it over 99 now?  Very close.  No, 98 and change.  98, high 98.  At one point, I believe it was 70 points away from 10,000.  Wow.  So doing well, but people getting a little shaky.  Get a little scared when it does this.  And I'm a little scared of the market these days. 
[41:00]
 Why?  Because there's something going on.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but the sure things aren't as sure as they were a few months ago.  As far as the internet stocks or?  Everything.  A little fluctuation.  Oil's going up, though.  Have fun with that.  Yeah, that's interesting.  Why is oil going up?  Inflation's going to go up.  We got to do our...  We got to do our oil crisis break someday.  Oh, yeah.  That is the biggest crock of ass.  What?  Every 15 years, we have an oil crisis, right? 
[41:30]
 Yeah, somehow there's a shortage.  And how do we get oil?  We pump it out of the ground.  It's from what?  Dinosaurs that have been rotting for thousands of years.  Is this right?  Yes.  Let's go to the basics of this discussion.  It's prehistoric crap under the earth that through pressure, time and heat,  is converted into fossil fuel.  Oh, so we have this oil crisis, everyone's well.  Yes.  And we can't find oil.  So the prices go through the roof and then everyone has to start buying the crappy small cars and stuff. 
[42:00]
 Yeah, put away your SUVs.  And then next thing you know, they find more oil.  E.Gad.  What?  What?  We just made more oil?  No.  There's a certain amount of oil.  The Arabs hoard it.  They were hoarding it.  I almost cursed.  That's bold.  It wasn't a shortage.  There were barrels upon barrels, but they were hoarding it.  They always say it's a shortage, though.  Of course.  If they can't find any more, they have no idea where it is and they got to make more. 
[42:30]
 The energy crisis.  Now, we've got to make more.  There's plenty of it.  And in this day and age, if we have to wait on a line to get gas.  The extra hour of sleep that they're getting.  Go by and say, if I were them, I would still be sleeping as well.  I think Tom Brokaw could be a wacky DJ in this town, Anthony. 
[43:00]
 Let me tell you, folks, how about those homeless people?  Hey, how many homeless does it take to change a light bulb?  How many times?  None.  There's no light bulbs in a refrigerator box.  But you know, folks, I was a little upset yesterday.  Yeah?  Because you said Tom Brokaw was not exciting.  Tom Brokaw was not a fun guy.  A guy that exudes humor and laughter and jocularity. 
[43:30]
 Well, your voice is a bore.  It does put people to sleep.  You slurn all over the place.  It sounds like you're on cold medicine.  Well, I'm a little drowsy today.  Now, why are you drowsy today?  Well, since I was installing in a ceiling in my office, it fell and a blade hit my head.  I'm a little woozy.  But I took great offense to you saying Tom Brokaw was not an exciting individual. 
[44:00]
 So I figured I'd spice things up with a little humor as I sat in on the Today Show for Matt Lauer.  You're trying to become politically incorrect these days, Tom?  Well, I see how some of the young comics are using this political incorrectness  to boost their careers to new levels.  Levels, yeah.  Levels, levels.  So I figured it off to me, Tom Brokaw could do the same. 
[44:30]
 Okay.  By telling a few jokes that I understand they're a little off color.  But that's how to get ahead these days.  Hey, did you hear?  Oh, no.  The one about the black and the Puerto Rican in the car?  Hey, who's driving?  I don't know who's driving, Tom.  The police.  Oh my gosh.  But you know, why can't Tom Brokaw say these jokes? 
[45:00]
 Well, because you're a respected newsman.  Hey, look, I have a new homeless toilet bowl.  Yeah?  It's a jar with a flush handle.  All right, I'm working on that one.  But Tom Brokaw, working my act, holding my craft.  Yeah.  I'm slinging it from out all of...  Not lower.  Are you going to be playing Caroline's in the near future with these jokes?  No, no, actually, I'm going to have to start out as  left your balls off in Poughkeepsie, opening for the Dice Man. 
[45:30]
 I see.  But it's very awkward.  Do you have any other jokes you want to try out for our audience?  No, no, I just wish I stunk as bad as homeless people.  That way I wouldn't have to ever talk to a Harald Rivera.  He's run away because I sunk so bad.  Thank you.  Boy, I sure have to work on it.  Trust me, you stink just as bad as the homeless, Tom.  Tom, Tom.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightline News. 
[46:00]
 Hey, what's that?  What's that rat on top of Ted Koppel's head?  It looks like a homeless guy.  Homeless.  I see you're laughing at me.  I'm laughing at you, yes.  Tom Brokaw.  The new Tom Brokaw.  It's the funny Google Ha Ha Tom Brokaw.  Look, look, I have a wacky horn.  Maybe that'll help your jokes if you toot the wacky horn after the jokes.  I don't even think Tom Brokaw needs jokes with a wacky horn. 
[46:30]
 Listen, listen.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightline News.  20 people killed in an Amtrak accident.  See, it'll spice up the news, make things a little more funny.  Or racial tensions in Los Angeles today as a white mob beats a black man.  See, it lightens things up.  I don't even have to tell them to the Tom Brokaw joke. 
[47:00]
 You might need the slide whistle too, Tom.  Let me try that one today.  A disaster in the skies, an airline crashes killing 250.  Yes, I could use that one.  Tom Brokaw.  Oh, this might have worked better for the Amtrak joke.  20 people killed as Amtrak metro liner derails in Washington.  Yes, that works.  Spicing up the news. 
[47:30]
 Check, please.  Check, please.  Well, you got the homeless people pissed off at you, Tom.  Screw them.  And the faux pas caused a stir on the internet and NBC's switchboard was overwhelmed with  complaints about you.  They don't even have phones or TVs.  How do they know Tom Brokaw said anything about the homeless?  Yeah, you think you could talk about those people?  Come on.  I didn't know I was being invited into their box every evening. 
[48:00]
 What can I say?  Boy, those people sure smell like urine.  This is top shelf stuff, Tom.  Check, please.  All right, we'll get you out of this one.  All right, Anthony, we got to talk about Stacker 2 here.  Anthony seems to have left the studio.  I will be sitting in on your commercial for Stacker 2.  A lovely product that I use myself. 
[48:30]
 You should use it.  I don't think you're using it yet.  No, I did actually take one.  The truth of the matter is Tom Brokaw would be dead if I hadn't taken it.  I'm, oh, I'm up.  You're up, huh?  Up as a pup.  Well, I took the Stacker 2 once again before the show and I'm flying.  Simple as that, I'm flying.  So am I.  Okay.  Look at me.  I'm a mad man.  I'm out of control. 
[49:00]
 Yeah, you're just, you're zanerific, Mr. Brokaw.  Imagine a fat burner guaranteed to work in just 45 minutes or your money back, Tom.  The same fat burning muscle building agents relied upon by professional bodybuilders  to become rock hard sculpted and fat free.  So basically this product gives you a boost of energy, which it's doing to me today.  And it also burns fat.  How about that?  And this stuff works within 45 minutes of taking it.  You'll become a firm believer in Stacker 2. 
[49:30]
 Excellent.  A great way to get the chicks.  Obviously a nice flat stomach and you're off and exhilarating.  Tom, you need to take another stacker 2 pill.  You're, you're fading on me.  All right, give me one, another one.  All right.  Also it comes, it comes with a money back guarantee.  If you don't like the product or it's not doing anything for you,  the company will definitely give you your money back.  You can give them a call.  It's 1-800-LIGHTLINE.  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E line. 
[50:00]
 Thank God.  I didn't have to say that.  Call today and order the world's strongest fat burner.  And you'll get an energy boost as well.  Just like Mr. Brokaw is getting today.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York.  That's the band Marvelous 3 and Freak of the Week.  It's Sophie and Anthony.  Hey man.  Thanks for checking us out.  We appreciate it.  As always.  We got a whole new audience driving home right now.  So I got to ask for you guys help once again.  We did this earlier and a lot of people have helped us and others have made it more difficult. 
[50:30]
 And it really is.  We have noticed when we read all your email every day  that a lot of you guys have only started listening to the show last week.  One guy wrote he found us Tuesday when Sammy Hagar was in here drinking tequila with us.  And now he's hooked.  Some people have been with us since day one.  Others hated us at first but we're growing on them a little bit. 
[51:00]
 Others used to like us early on but now they hate us.  And it's a whole mess going on.  So hard to keep track of.  So we're doing a little survey for our radio show.  Okay.  And we're looking for all the faithful listeners to send an email in the next couple of days.  To our email address, not the instant feedback.  Because this stuff we read and then it's gone.  We want to print this up and stuff and read all of them and  kind of take a look at our show where it's been and where it's going and stuff.  So if you're a faithful listener to the show, 
[51:30]
 we need to know just a few things.  Your name, how old you are is very important.  Where you live, and how long you've been listening to us.  That's it.  If you've been listening since August, cool.  If you've been listening since last week, cool too I guess.  Where have you been?  Where have you been?  And if you want to put down a few bits that you've liked in the last nine months,  that would help as well.  Okay.  Because we're just trying to get an overall feel of who's listening to the show these days.  It'll really, really help us out and we really need you guys to do this. 
[52:00]
 But don't do it through the instant feedback, which everyone seems to be doing.  Because we can't print that up and read it and do some research on that.  So the email address is opac,  opack at wnaw.com.  All right.  And if you forgot that email address or didn't write it down,  you could go to the NW website and you could email us from there.  The regular email, not the instant feedback.  All right.  All right.  And we'd appreciate that.  Speaking of our faithful listeners, Anthony, you know Paul, the lawyer from Jersey. 
[52:30]
 We love Paul.  He's like a regular on our show.  We haven't had his voice on, but he likes to email us all the time and fax us.  And he pays attention to everything we say on this show.  And he writes down, he makes notes and then he, he sends his observations to us.  Okay.  All right.  What is it?  I got another fax from Paul, the attorney from Jersey.  Paul writes, I've been a faithful listener since August 28th, 1998.  Even Paul wasn't with us from the beginning. 
[53:00]
 That's a surprise.  Well, pretty much the beginning.  We started June, what, 15th or so.  During that time, I have received the following unforgettable advice from Anthony  as words to live by.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Number one, Anthony has said this on the air.  If you drive a piece of crap car, don't toot your horn.  Right.  That's great advice.  Okay.  For anyone.  Number two, if women want to attract men, they should hold two juice cans up to their  breasts and yell, how do you, how do you like these cans? 
[53:30]
 I may have said that in passing.  I think taken out of context, it's a little worse.  Well, he's got a couple more.  Paul, the attorney from Jersey.  Number three, it's still okay to drink and drive in New York City and  Nassau County as long as you drive a piece of S car that you don't mind losing.  You didn't say that, did you?  I don't know.  If he says I said it, maybe it.  Well, it was Anthony's way around the drunk driving law that the  mayor has enacted here in our fine city. 
[54:00]
 I could have said something like, it's horrible for anyone to believe you can.  And then that sentence, but I don't know what the context is.  Okay.  Number four, it's okay to ignore your wife and play half life all night.  As long as you spring out of bed early the next morning without  complaint and take the bitch shopping.  Oh, wow.  I don't think I ever said that.  I like to see the tape on that one.  I think he's making stuff up now. 
[54:30]
 Well, you have commented about your half life habit.  Yes.  And you have said, as long as you pay attention to your wife the next day  and do some chores and stuff, you're okay.  Yeah.  I've cut my half life playing down quite a bit.  There are many more, but these should suffice.  Take care, Paul.  Paul, if you're still listening, we want the rest of your list  because you've only scratched the surface on what Anthony has said on this show.  Oh, my goodness.  And I've been a complete saint.  I want to be.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  How about coming up for a words from Opie?  Words to live by. 
[55:00]
 Sure.  That would be a little more shocking.  You can't even think of one.  Yeah, I bet.  You guys are ready for morning drive.  You'll kick his ass.  We just.  We just turned to K rock.  Blow me, Tom.  See you later, Tom.  Boy, that Wil Penn, Darvis dude is really good.  Yeah, that's some good stuff.  Hey, hey.  Yo.  Please.  Boy, Tom, you scare us. 
[55:30]
 Go there.  Go there.  We don't care.  Hope you're wearing earplugs.  All right.  I fall asleep at the wheel.  All right.  Um, well, we got to talk about prostate cancer again, Anthony.  Well, big in the news, Opie.  Do you want to?  Tori Yankees.  What?  You want to take a break?  You want to do it now?  We take a break and then get into it.  Sure.  Yeah.  Why not?  OK.  We'll take a break and we'll talk about it next.  Sure.  Well, I mean, there's a they have a whole list of celebrities that have had prostate cancer. 
[56:00]
 I see that.  And one celebrity jumps right off the page.  So I figured we'd mention it on our show today.  So Harry Belafonte.  Well, I was thinking more of Charlton Heston there.  Chuck Heston.  Yes.  Chuck Heston.  So maybe you never know.  Maybe Heston will stop by to talk about his prostate cancer like he did on Larry King about  a month ago.  A happy survivor.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah.  Stick around for that and more stupidity.  Jeremy.  Hey.  What do you got, man?  This is Jeremy. 
[56:30]
 Yeah.  And is this Opie and Anthony?  Yes.  You're live on the air.  What do you got?  Well, I heard you guys talking earlier about the guy who writes down the stuff that Anthony  says.  Yeah.  Things to live by.  Yeah.  And I wanted to add something to live by from Opie.  Oh, good.  And that never put your kid on the phone to talk to Opie around Christmas time because  he's going to tell him there's no Santa Claus.  I don't remember that.  And I, dude, I really thought it was funny, though.  I mean, the kid freaked out and it was great. 
[57:00]
 But I'm never going to let my kid talk to you.  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I'm sure you don't, right?  I don't think there's a tape that exists that actually has me doing that.  Oh, well, yeah.  Well, we've got it.  We've got it.  Go download it, everybody.  It's a riot.  And you were talking earlier about people sending in their emails and stuff saying how  long they've listened and all that.  I've been a loyal fan since the AAF days, guys.  Oh, I appreciate that.  And I'm going to school here in New York.  And I don't know if New York appreciates the legends that they have down here. 
[57:30]
 Who?  There you guys.  They're really lucky you guys are a riot.  And I wanted to wish you a belated wow day, by the way.  It's on the way.  Wow is coming.  Wow is great.  Wow is coming.  Wait till New York gets wow.  All right, buddy.  Howard who?  We're legends in our own minds.  That's right, man.  Yeah, really.  All right, buddy.  Thanks.  Take it easy, guys.  All right, Jeremy.  That was pretty cool.  All right.  This is for you guys if you were at the show last night.  Johnny Lang.  I think the Rock of New York 1027 W. 
[58:00]
 Any W.  The out infamous pipe song, especially for Joe Tory.  Now, that's not our it's you guys, the listeners.  You wanted us to play that for Tory.  So.  Well, yeah, when you're getting that prostate examined, they got they got a they got a probe  you and all sorts of regions.  Yeah.  Oh, God, getting old.  That's just it just sucks.  Well, everyone is talking about prostate cancer these days.  Who's had it?  Who's beat it? 
[58:30]
 My goodness.  It's not fun, obviously, but it affects a lot of men.  And the paper, what is this, the Post?  Yeah.  Has a bunch of celebrities that have, you know, helped the disease by talking about it.  Sid Sidney Portier.  I can't say his name.  Sidney.  Right.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Jerry Lewis had it.  Arnold Palmer had it.  Bob Dole had it.  It.  Uh, Marv Levy, the coach of the Bills had a Stan Musial had it. 
[59:00]
 Michael Milken had it.  Norman Schwarzkopf had it.  Merv Merv Griffin, Harry Belafonte, Louis Farrakhan, Jesse Helms.  The disease definitely doesn't discriminate, huh?  Louis Farrakhan and Jesse.  I know.  How about that?  Mayor Marion Barry.  Marion Barry.  And our favorite Chuck Heston.  Chuck Heston.  He had a prostate cancer.  Yes.  He was on Larry King discussing it a couple months back. 
[59:30]
 Really?  I guess he has beaten it thus far.  Yeah.  And Frank Zappa died of it.  Oh, oh wait.  Yes.  Oh, I forgot about that.  I forgot that he did say he didn't.  And he didn't catch it early.  He even said he even said in interviews, he's like, yeah, I had symptoms and everything.  He had a fear of doctors and just didn't go until it got out of hand and that was it.  I didn't know it was prostate cancer.  Wow.  Why does it hurt when I pee? 
[60:00]
 What the hell is that?  What is that?  The fire alarm is going off in the building.  Is it?  Do we have to evacuate?  Do we have to leave?  I don't think so.  No, we don't have to leave.  We're in a fireproof room, right?  Let him burn.  Who cares?  Oh, great.  We'll concentrate on this break as they're evacuating the building.  Was it a test or something?  Yeah, go scope that out.  Yeah, go find out.  See if there's an actual fire.  We'll hang out the window and scream and stuff until the fire department comes.  Kind of important.  Maybe they could get one of those big huge ladders and rescue us. 
[60:30]
 That'd be fun.  That'll be zany.  That'd be pretty cool.  But yeah, Chuck Heston had prostate cancer and thus far he's okay.  Damn, thank God.  Thank the powers of God that I realized.  I heeded the warnings and went to my doctor.  But be it not a merciful God that would put a  Z's on a man that would make it so he needed a metal probe put in his swine. 
[61:00]
 My God!  Lord, why?  Damn you!  Damn you!  Why?  Why?  I have been so faithful.  Did you give me a disease which you had to put a metal probe in my swine?  My prostate looked like the stone tablets that the 10 commandments were chiseled upon. 
[61:30]
 Felt like that.  Ow!  But I beat it.  I beat that awful disease.  Now I just got to beat this thing on my head.  What is it?  It's your hair.  Oh, God!  Damn!  Look at it!  Looked like a big rat.  That's what my prostate looked like.  Looked like my toupee.  Look at it!  Look at it!  Damn you!  It looked like a monkey ass on my head.  Now Mr. Heston, you had the procedure done for your prostate cancer, right? 
[62:00]
 Yes, I did.  First they had to do the examination.  When I first felt the symptoms, it was very hard for Charlton to pee.  Very hard.  And it hurt.  I'd urinate.  I'd stand there and go, come on, come on, coaxing it along.  And then finally when it started coming out, I would go, damn you!  Ah, the pain!  Damn you to hell! 
[62:30]
 Why can I not urinate?  Yes.  So I went to the doctor for a prostate exam.  You know what that entails.  He snaps on the rubber glove and examines you.  It wasn't as pleasurable as when Zira did it.  She just flipped the old loin cloth up and put a fuzzy little paw in my ass.  But when a doctor's doing it, that isn't too fun. 
[63:00]
 No, not at all.  Especially when I felt him probing, probing, probing Charlton's deepest innards.  And he had both hands on my shoulders.  Damn him!  Damn him to hell!  Where's my music?  Hey, thank you.  How can I get worked up without my music?  So I took the bad news.  That I indeed had prostate cancer. 
[63:30]
 And well, I had the procedure and now I'm fine.  Well, they say some men after they have the procedure, Mr. Heston.  Yes.  Their unit doesn't work as well as it did before the procedure.  Let it be known.  Let it be known.  Charlton Heston Schween is like the staff I carried in the Ten Commandments.  Yes, I cast my staff across the waters. 
[64:00]
 My God, it still functions.  Are you trying to say Charlton is limp?  No, damn you!  Do not start that rumor.  Have you destroyed?  No, no.  And how's your ass?  My ass?  After the examination, it was a little chafed in red.  Looked like a monkey ass.  A big red monkey ass. 
[64:30]
 So embarrassing.  I was walking around in the hospital with that gown.  The gown with the opening in the back.  And everyone's going, look at Charlton's ass.  My God, it looks like a monkey ass.  Degrading.  Degrading.  I had sponge baths.  It was worse than getting hosed down.  Remember when I got hosed down?  It's a madhouse!  A madhouse! 
[65:00]
 Damn you!  Sorry, I had to help you out with that.  And yes, of course, it didn't make noise when I farted.  Just sounded like...  But I'm all tightened up now.  Oh, that's good.  It's all good.  What?  Oh, I saw that monkey on my head.  It was my toupee.  Sometimes I still get startled.  Damn you!  Why can't I have nice hair?  What happened to my hair?  Now, a lot of people want to know if you're still partaking in the, let's say, monkey meat. 
[65:30]
 You had to get into this, didn't you?  All right, I admit.  When I had my prostate surgery, it was kind of hard for me to get aroused at first.  Little hard.  Until I gazed upon monkey ass!  Yes, sir.  What is my view?  Sorry.  Can't, by the love of God, can't you get a longer cart?  My God! 
[66:00]
 All right, there you go.  I do partake in the monkey meat.  The pledges of the meat of the monkey.  Big red monkey ass.  I love monkey ass.  All right, you got it out of me.  Can I go now?  Yeah, get the hell out of here.  Get on your chair and get the hell out of here.  There he goes, everyone.  Chuck Heston.  Wow!  He's worked up, Opie.  He doesn't like the fact that his music doesn't last as long as the bit. 
[66:30]
 The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW.  You two's sweetest thing.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Hey.  You two was one of those bands that I was proud to admit was one of my favorite bands of all time.  And now I'm almost embarrassed to say that they're one of my favorite bands.  We've had a few of those.  Has that ever happened to you?  Of course.  Or other people in Radio Land?  You know, you're really into a band and you want to tell the whole world you're into them.  And the next thing you know, they start kind of doing things that you're really not into anymore. 
[67:00]
 You're like, oh man, they're really effing this up.  That reminds me of my ABBA years.  I mean, come on, you two with Joshua Tree and Octong Baby and Unforgettable Fire.  Time goes on, Opie.  And then they put out Pop and you're like, well, yeah, I like you too, but you know.  Yeah.  I understand.  Well, sometimes that just happens.  Time passes and some bands just either don't keep up with the times or try too hard to change. 
[67:30]
 I think they try a little too hard to change.  And I love the people that are with their favorite band to the end.  I mean, to the end.  A good example, Journey.  They went through all the changes and stuff, but no, man, Journey's my favorite band.  And then they don't even have what's his name doing the vocals anymore.  Steve Perry.  Steve Perry, but no, man, I'm still with them.  Yeah.  It's not Journey anymore.  Give it up at that point. 
[68:00]
 He should give it up anyway, even if he was still.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  If you're at the Journey, that's your own business.  But.  Fag with a capital F.  But that's just a good example of a band that just went south and people were hanging on,  going, no, man, same thing with Van Halen.  You know, David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar, people were still hanging in there.  And in a lot of cases, more people came aboard because of Sammy Hagar.  Like two different bands.  Yeah.  And then, then Gary, you know, Sharon. 
[68:30]
 Yeah.  And then it was just.  You can't honestly say that last Van Halen album was good.  But the hardcore Van Halen fans hanging on, going, no, man, it's not bad.  VH.  Oh, yeah.  Kick it.  Like, no, they're.  You do five hits of acid, man.  There's some stuff on this album that kicks ass.  You know what I mean, though?  I hear you.  That's what's kind of happening with me and you two.  It's like, when do I officially give up?  What is it going to take? 
[69:00]
 Hmm.  I mean, they went disco basically with pop.  Yeah.  And people will argue that point with me, but no, it was, it was a dance record.  I like the other end of the spectrum, too.  The people that are really into bands before they really break  and then get totally P.O.ed when the band breaks.  Newbies coming on board.  They went commercial sold out, man.  I have like a cassette tape of Metallica, you know, from like 78.  And like then they just went to crap. 
[69:30]
 Like, wow.  The fact is every single band out there wants to make it.  Of course.  You're not just playing to play.  You always have this dream of making it and they're all.  A deal.  They're all trying to be quote sellouts in a way.  Yeah.  So when they finally do break and make it.  The story with Metallica, they wanted to be on the radio forever for years.  They were sending their stuff to radio stations, you know,  and then finally broke with the black album. 
[70:00]
 You know, it's stupid to think Metallica never want to be discovered  and never want to be huge.  No, but the early fans never wanted them to be discovered.  Well, Ralph jumped in.  Look, it's the goal of every band.  Every band wants to get signed to a record label.  Every band wants to be Hanson and sell five million copies of their record.  That's for sure.  And they want, you know, they want all that goes with it.  That's the goal of every, every band.  But it does suck when everyone else discovers your band,  you know, like Anthony was saying earlier.  Yeah, I was, I was so into Nirvana when I swear to you, 
[70:30]
 I was at a station that we were one of the first radio stations in America,  playing in America and yeah, in America, besides Seattle, that was playing Nirvana.  I was so into this, you know, smells like teen spirit.  I mean, the whole album I love and then it just broke across America.  I'm like, oh, great.  I was so bummed, but happy for the band.  Yeah.  Well, I can kind of relate back in when I was in school and me and my friends, 
[71:00]
 you know, Joe Carrey and are all crotties to hang out with was into Charlie Daniels,  you know, who wasn't into Charlie Daniels?  But then they, they put out that devil went down to Georgia song.  And then like, you see the preppy dude starting to wear the boots and the hat,  you know, the cowboy hat thing.  And meanwhile, you were just in jeans drinking whiskey in the woods  and listening to some Charlie Daniels.  Right.  And then they, they put that out and it was like, ah, now,  now everybody knows who they are.  Not only did they put that wacky song out,  then radio had to make it even worse by doing what? Son of a gun. 
[71:30]
 They had to do two different versions.  Oh, you can't say son of a bitch.  Make a son of a gun version.  A son of a gun version.  Oh, can you imagine being a man?  You're going to have to rerecord and say son of a gun instead of son of a bitch.  Well, I'm kind of embarrassed that I was into that, but you know, you got to share here.  That's all about it.  It's our little therapy session.  Everybody in Long Island was.  That's true.  Charlie Daniels said that.  I was never into Charlie Daniels.  God damn it. 
[72:00]
 Well, so don't make it sound like you're all that big and hot.  I mean, what, who were you into back then?  Deep Purple.  So was I, but oh, you got, there was a band that makes you cringe now that you were into.  Deep Purple?  Not as bad as, no, no, no.  No, I mean, there had to be another band.  I was into Deep Purple too.  While he's thinking, the point I was trying to make is that Charlie Daniels said  that Southern Rock was so big on Long Island during that era that it was almost a suburb of  Atlanta.  That's the way he looked at Long Island. 
[72:30]
 Really?  Yeah.  Southern Rock was huge on the island.  So did not be.  It was.  Daniels and Marshall Tucker, the Allman brothers and everybody that went along Blackfoot.  I mean, even the tiny ones, you know, everybody was into Southern Rock big time.  Right on.  You don't have a band that you're just embarrassed to have.  I mean, Charlie Daniels isn't even a bad example, really.  No, but I mean, there's, I can't really, and honestly, I can't really,  because I was like in a Zeppelin and Sabbath.  Oh, you were just the coolest guy.  What a dick, man. 
[73:00]
 Well, come on, you're not like the monkeys.  I know the monkeys.  You were just the coolest guy.  But then again, Zeppelin putting out code, it was kind of an embarrassment.  Oh, come on.  That doesn't even, that doesn't count.  That's, you know, to be so cool, that's embarrassing to me.  All right.  You do have one.  Come on, you got one.  All right.  I finally figured it out.  Oh, I don't even want to admit this.  So I'm Brady boy.  Oh, ready?  Okay, I'm ready.  Genesis.  Well, back then, that's okay.  Back then, it was what I mean, though. 
[73:30]
 Well, just well, Charlie Daniels was cool.  Yeah.  But now you think back and it's like, that's what I think when I think Genesis.  I'm like, oh, cool from that era.  Peter Gabriel, that whole thing.  Genesis put out a bunch of crap albums.  The old stuff, too?  No, I mean, after Abicab, Abicab was borderline okay.  Borderline.  I mean, I don't even want to brag that I was into that album.  I'm with you.  I'm with you.  But after that, it was all crap.  Yeah, that's how I felt about a Starland vocal band. 
[74:00]
 After Afternoon Delight, it just went downhill.  I don't have the most recent Charlie Daniels band album either.  I mean, you know, there comes a point where it's like saturation.  You know what?  Blue was the cult.  I had to give up on Blue was the cult.  After a while, they were like my favorite band ever.  And then after a while, it just got like, well, this just sucks.  It's really bad.  But that happens with a lot of bands.  They peak, they put out that great album and they never go achieve that level again.  Well, Ralph, the point we're making because you came in late, though, was no, and it's okay. 
[74:30]
 Was where can we get a sex break out of this?  Yeah, where can we tie this into sex?  No, but people, you know, they have their favorite band  and when is enough enough where you finally have to go, wow, man, they're just not cool anymore.  And we brought up the example of Journey.  All the hardcore fans still hanging on after Steve Perry left the band.  It's over.  It's ridiculous at that point.  Yeah, it's over, Johnny.  I wanted to state-  Well, you loved U2.  You were a big U2 fan. 
[75:00]
 That's what it came up at.  That's where the conversation came from.  He's ready to give up on U2 now.  I'm like, when do I give up?  It's one more album.  They've got one more album on my, you know, as far as I'm concerned.  Yeah, but if they don't go back to just a serious, you know, rock sounding album.  Oh, can they?  Did you see Bono when he was on the show with the, what were those glasses all about?  I don't know.  It was a bright yellow tint.  Game over, man.  We're screwed.  You know, if U2 is listening, they got to completely just strip it down and go back 
[75:30]
 to their roots and just go out.  Leather.  Huh?  They need leather.  They got to do like the whole leather thing that Presley did.  Oh, what are you saying?  No, Presley regained his, when he did that special, it was all just come back.  The comeback special, right?  Oh, yeah.  He was all in leather.  He got back to his roots.  You know?  That's the only hope they got.  They got to get back to their roots.  Right.  All right.  We had all the things we want to talk about here, but.  That's okay.  That was a pretty good break.  Allowed our little discussions every so often.  I'm going to screw you guys up. 
[76:00]
 I'm sorry.  No, not at all.  Are you kidding?  Yeah, that's redundant.  No, screwing us up.  Yeah, impossible.  If we do a music break, we need Ralph to tour in here.  The king of rock knowledge.  All right, I'm going to give us a B plus on that break.  What are you grading?  Wait, did you go to B plus there?  What?  Did I make the Dean's List?  Did I make the Dean's List?  I get a report card every quarter.  What's going on here?  I didn't know we were pulling together our desks into a lab table.  Yeah.  Ralph's contribution. 
[76:30]
 I don't want to do my lab part.  I'll give you like a B minus.  That was cool.  Yeah.  All right.  But you're a little.  You're a little wasted and tired from Johnny Lang.  What am I getting?  And you were solid there.  Oh, thank you, Opie.  Thank you.  You gotta be nice to your teacher.  Why are you the teacher?  Why are you the one grading?  Let's grade Opie now, shall we?  Yeah.  All right, yeah.  Opie.  F.  Ah, you didn't say it.  I'm kidding.  I had to drag you into the conversation.  One, two, seven, W, N, E, W, the Rock in New York, R, E, M from up.  That's Lotus. 
[77:00]
 Hendricks before that.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Boy, we got a guy in the line that wants to abuse me now.  You were taking some heat earlier.  We got this guy, Paul.  He's a lawyer in Jersey.  He listens to the show so closely that he jots things down  and then he makes observations from time to time.  And he was given the words of Anthony earlier.  Do I have the list anymore?  I don't know.  Here's some of the just.  Oh, here it is.  Just some of the outrageous outrageous things you've said.  You called him Anthony's words to live by. 
[77:30]
 Yeah, here it is.  Words live by Anthony.  Number one, if you drive a piece of crap car, don't toot your horn.  I've said that.  I remember saying that.  That's a good one, right?  Sure.  Two, if women want to attract men,  they should hold two juice cans up to their breasts and yell,  how do you like these cans?  Now, maybe in some conversation I use that.  I don't remember ever saying that.  All right.  Number three, it's still okay to drink a drive in New York City  and Nassau County as long as you drive a piece of S car  that you don't mind losing. 
[78:00]
 I probably said that.  Okay, I'll fess up to that.  And number four, I don't know.  I think you took some liberties with this one,  but number four, it's okay to ignore your wife  and play half life all night long.  All night as long as you're just spurn out a bed early next morning  without complaining and take the bitch shopping.  The bitch.  No.  She's going to kick your ass.  That doesn't sound right.  This is Paul the lawyer, Jen,  because I know she listens to us.  I think you kind of were talking about that, 
[78:30]
 but I don't think you put in those words.  I didn't put it in those words.  No, no.  I said I have to spend as much quality time with my wife  as I do playing half life.  And if you're, you know, playing till three in the morning,  you'll make sure you're up by eight to go shopping  and then do the stuff that needs to be done with Jen.  And so no, just the next day has to be, you know,  sit on the couch day.  And then Paul writes, there are many more,  but these should suffice for now.  Well, Paul, send in the rest of them.  But now there's a guy.  Yeah, can't wait to hear them.  Yeah.  Well, there's a guy on the line that wants to get me now. 
[79:00]
 Okay.  I guess I've had some words to live by in the past as well.  I can't think of any offhand, but.  Hi, Andy W.  Yeah. Hi, Zopie.  Yeah, what's up, buddy?  I remember two occasions where you have given out advice  to the world that are words to live by.  All right.  All right.  The first of the first is your long stand on political correctness,  which I believe your direct quote was,  everybody needs to lighten the F up.  Okay.  Which I embrace in my everyday life.  Well, I'm proud of that one.  And the other is, well, you had said at one point 
[79:30]
 that John Benet Ramsey is really not that hot  if you take away the makeup and the sweat clothes.  Wasn't that Anthony?  No, that was you.  No, no, that wasn't me.  I remember that was, that was, that was Opie said that.  Oh.  Because Anthony had a field day with it.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Right?  Right.  Anthony, fess up.  What?  Fess up.  I'll find a tape if it takes me a year. 
[80:00]
 See, when we first started here,  a lot of people were confused who was who.  Yeah.  So you said it and that guy thought I said it.  Now, in passing, I may have said John Benet Ramsey  without the makeup and cool clothes isn't that hot.  I think I was probably trying to make a point.  I don't know what point that is now.  What?  I don't know.  That is sick.  That is sick. 
[80:30]
 All right.  Didn't you say we're only a couple of years away  from a legal threesome with the Olsen twins?  No, that was you too.  Oh, damn, that was me.  That was you.  Okay.  Maybe I was doing examples of things that should never ever be said.  Wasn't that the show title that day?  Things that should never ever be said.  No, they all came from you, Anthony.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh, I know one.  Hold it.  Hold it. 
[81:00]
 Who's the one on this very show when there was a picture on the paper of OJ's daughter,  how she looks now, all fat, and you said,  wow, she's not hot like she used to be?  Well, yeah, I may have said that.  Didn't you say that or something like that?  All right, I'll take credit for that one.  Yeah, I'm remembering that one.  That's not as bad as...  What happened to her?  She used to be hot.  That was it.  You looked at her picture and said, what happened to OJ's daughter?  She used to be hot.  You used. 
[81:30]
 All right, I said that, but then you had an outdo me,  and you came up with the Joan Bonet-Ramsey comment.  You know, I don't recall making that statement like that.  Hi, NW.  Hey, it's Rich from Baldwin.  Hey, what do you got, Rich?  Well, we're talking about this Tory cancer thing.  You know, he's got it in the prostate.  Strawberry's got it in the colon.  I want to know what's going on in the locker room, man. 
[82:00]
 Oh my God, what are you implying?  You know, I'm not implying anything,  but it creates a hell of a visual there.  You think down strawberry wanted playing time that bad?  That's just nuts.  Oh, obviously that's not sexually transmitted.  You nut.  I'm just kind of bummed that I didn't think of that one.  I don't know.  You're sick.  You talk to someone else, but you don't.  All right, buddy.  All right, you guys rock, man.  If you're up, if you're on. 
[82:30]

That's because Priceline is the best way on or off the Internet to save on airline tickets,  hotel rooms and home mortgages.  Anthony.  Oh, look at that.  They're in the home mortgages business now.  You've probably heard William Shatner talking about Priceline.com.  Yes, I love Priceline.  Hey, let's read a couple of letters from Priceline customers. 
[83:30]
 Look at this one.  Dear Priceline, thanks to you, I saved about  one thousand dollars in airfare for this customer.  I saved over three hundred dollars on my tickets or this one.  The best thing about Priceline is that it's free, free unlike the thralls.  They were not free.  I had to go to their planet and free them. 
[84:00]
 But Priceline is free and it's so easy anyone can do it.  All right.  Yeah.  Priceline.com is very easy.  Just tell Priceline where and when you want to go and how much you want to pay.

[85:00]
 And the crew leaving for the Allman Brothers, Ralph Titora, Ben the Fag and Black Earl,  everyone on our way, even his jacket is black.  His scarf is black.  Yeah, dude, his underwear is black.  Get out.  How would you know?  He showed everyone at Caroline's about.  I don't want to see Earl.  What?  Excuse me while I whip this out.  Is that a little?  Get out of here, man.  I love that line.  Not only that, yeah, we were at Caroline's and everybody was wondering if everything 
[85:30]
 Earl wore was black.  That's why we call him Black Earl because he wears all black.  And Earl, you volunteered.  Yeah, he kind of, you know, went reaching in his pants.  It kind of got frightening for a second there.  I saw some people in fear walking away, running away.  And then where are the white women at?  Hey, Cleveland. 
[86:00]
 But he did indeed pull out his black underwear.  All black.  I'm shocked, Earl.  Oh, yeah.  I have been nine and a half weeks closet.  Now, Earl, when you, oh, I heard nine and a half.  Nine and a half.  I was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I heard, I have nine and a half.  I was like, oh, wait, wait, wait.  We need to know the stats, man.  And now, Earl, when you're playing basketball, do you wear like black socks?  Yeah.  And black sneaks?  Mm hmm.  Can you play basketball?  Wow.  Isn't that amazing?  Total black.  Well, Ben was at, you were at his pad, his groovy bachelor pad, right? 
[86:30]
 I have been at, as Earl calls it, the palace.  Now, you saw his closet.  Entirely black.  Wow.  Everything.  Some of the Yankees jerseys. </pre>
